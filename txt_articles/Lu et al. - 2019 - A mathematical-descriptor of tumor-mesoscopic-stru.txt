The five-year survival rate of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is approximately 35–40%
despite maximal treatment efforts, highlighting a need for stratification biomarkers for
personalized treatment. Here we extract 657 quantitative mathematical descriptors from
the preoperative CT images of 364 EOC patients at their initial presentation. Using machine
learning, we derive a non-invasive summary-statistic of the primary ovarian tumor based on
4 descriptors, which we name “Radiomic Prognostic Vector” (RPV). RPV reliably identifies
the 5% of patients with median overall survival less than 2 years, significantly improves
established prognostic methods, and is validated in two independent, multi-center cohorts.
Furthermore, genetic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis from two independent datasets
elucidate that stromal phenotype and DNA damage response pathways are activated in
RPV-stratified tumors. RPV and its associated analysis platform could be exploited to guide
personalized therapy of EOC and is potentially transferrable to other cancer types.

 “R
adiomics” quantifies mesoscopic tumor phenotype
from anatomic or functional images by defining tumor
spatial complexity—including first and higher order
statistics, fractal and shape features—generating disease features
not appreciated by the naked eye1–3. The development of a
radiomics approach for disease phenotyping, using routine pre-
surgical computed tomography (CT), as an extension of current
imaging semantics is therefore promising4–6.
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the sixth most common
cancer among women in the UK and has the highest mortality of
all gynecological cancers, accounting for 4% of all cancer deaths
in women7. High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) repre-
sents the most dominant (70% of EOC patients) and most lethal
histological subtype8. Although it is well known that HGSOC
patients have a heterogeneous response to treatment and prog-
nosis, extensive cytoreductive surgery combined with platinum-
based chemotherapy are currently the standard treatments for
most patients without consideration of individual prognostic and
predictive biomarkers. Recently, a number of studies including
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project have obtained a
comprehensive genomic profile of HGSOC, resulting in several
molecular
prognostic
biomarker
discoveries9.
For
instance,
CCNE1 amplification is commonly associated with platinum-
resistant and refractory disease10,11; HGSOCs were classified into
prognostically distinct molecular subtypes according to gene
expression profiling12–14. More recently, large sets of microRNAs
have been exploited to determine the risk profile of EOC15. It
remains challenging, however, to translate these molecularly
determined characteristics into clinically relevant biomarkers due
to intratumor heterogeneity, additional high assay cost, and time
delays. Therefore, a noninvasive, real-time, and cost-effective
prognostic marker approach is warranted to reliably guide per-
sonalized treatment of EOC patients.
In the current study, a novel radiomics-determined mathe-
matical descriptor of EOC tumor risk phenotype with a reliable,
convincing predictive value is discovered and validated, and
further insights into the biological basis of the descriptor is
provided through investigation of correlated transcriptomics,
proteomics and copy-number alterations (CNAs).
Results
Characteristics of data and patients. We developed TexLab 2.0,
a software program that summarized 657 features relating to the
shape and size, intensity, texture and wavelet decompositions of
364 preoperative contrast-enhanced CT scans16 (Table 1 and
Supplementary Figure 1). All the radiomic features are sum-
marized in Supplementary Data 1. A comprehensive molecular
profile including gene expression, copy-number, and protein
expression was analyzed for a subset of patients (Table 1). The
study workflow is summarized in Supplementary Figure 2.
We evaluated 294 primary EOC patients with fresh frozen
tissue treated within the Hammersmith Hospital, Imperial
College Healthcare NHS Trust, London, UK between 2004 and
2015 as well as 70 EOC patients from the TCGA project
(Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Figure 2).
Overview of radiomic profile in epithelial ovarian cancer. We
wished to investigate the data structure within the radiomic
profiles derived from primary tumors of EOC patients in relation
to clinical and genetic features. For samples with both radiomics
and CNA data, we performed a spectral clustering analysis based
on the Pearson correlation coefficients between each samples’
radiomic profile (Fig. 1a). There was a clear division of samples
into three major groups with each group characterized by high
feature similarity but largely distinct from those in other groups.
Notably, one of these groups (Group 1) was found to be sig-
nificantly enriched for HGSOC (Fig. 1b). EOC, particularly the
HGSOC subtype, frequently features CNAs17. We found that
Group 1 was enriched for tumors with high CNAs (Fig. 1c). This
group had a worse outcome as measured by progression-free
survival (PFS) (Supplementary Figure 3).
To further understand the radiomic characteristics of the
HGSOC subtype, we performed unsupervised hierarchical cluster-
ing analysis using the radiomic profiles in the HH cohort. We
found two distinct clusters within this population based purely
on the radiomic profile (Fig. 1d). Cluster 2 was significantly
associated with the presence of ascites (p = 0.00729, chi-squared
test) and poor PFS (p = 0.022, log-rank test; Fig. 1e), marginally
associated with higher tumor stage (p = 0.0686, Fisher’s exact
test), but not associated with postoperative residual disease or
molecular subtype (Fig. 1d). Of interest, 96% of bilateral tumors
from patient were assigned to the same cluster, revealing a close
radiomic similarity (Supplementary Note 1).
In aggregate, unsupervised analysis highlighted an intrinsic
association between radiomic profile, genetic background, and
clinical characteristics, warranting further characterization.
Radiomic prognostic vector predicts survival. We used three
datasets to assess the prognostic potential of the radiomic profile
for HGSOC patients: HGSOC cases from the HH cohort were
split into the HH discovery (n = 136) and the HH validation
datasets (n = 77), and examined in parallel with the TCGA
validation dataset (n = 70) (Supplementary Figure 2 and Sup-
plementary Table 1). We firstly performed Cox regression with
overall survival (OS) examining each radiomic feature in turn,
using data from primary tumors in the HH discovery dataset
(Supplementary Figure 2). Forty-two radiomic features were
found to be significantly associated with OS (false discovery rate
< 0.05; Fig. 2a; Supplementary Data 2). The 42 radiomic features
were further reduced to 4 weighted features using least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO18) (Fig. 2b, c and
Supplementary Table 2). The weighted sum of these four radio-
mic features gave a RPV score for each tumor.
With an unsupervised k-means clustering approach, we split all
the patients from the three cohorts based on their RPV into three
subgroups (low risk, medium risk, and high risk; Supplementary
Table 3). The patient groups stratified by RPV had distinct OS
differences in the discovery dataset (N = 136, p < 0.0001, log-
rank test; Fig. 2d). Using the same RPV decision boundaries,
OS differences were confirmed in two independent validation
datasets, the TCGA validation dataset (N = 70, p = 0.000105,
log-rank test; Fig. 2e) and the HH validation dataset (N = 77,
p = 0.0274, log-rank test; Fig. 2f).

 the potential structured noise in the datasets (scan thickness),
RPV remained significantly and continuously associated with OS
in the discovery dataset (hazard ratio (HR): 3.83, 95% confidence
interval (CI) (2.27–6.46), p = 5.11 × 10−7; RPV range: −0.322 to
3.16), as well as the TCGA validation dataset (HR: 4.87, 95% CI
(1.67–14.2), p = 0.00380) and the HH validation dataset (HR:
7.36, 95% CI (1.29–41.9), p = 0.0245; Table 2). The addition of
RPV improved the clinically available prognostic methods (stage,
age, and postoperative residual disease) in all three datasets as
measured by the concordance index (C-index)19 (HH discovery:
from 0.658 to 0.739; TCGA validation: from 0.549 to 0.690; HH
validation: from 0.659 to 0.679). Age, stage, and postoperative
residual disease were significantly associated with OS in either
uni- or multivariable analysis in the combined HH cohort while
RPV remained the strongest prognostic factor, suggesting RPV is
prognostic in a representative HGSOC cohort. RPV was also
found associated with OS independent of performance status
in a subset of patients (Supplementary Table 4). We excluded
performance status from the multivariable analysis to avoid
misinterpretation in the presence of insufficient data, given that
we only had the performance status of 62 out of the total
213 patients in the HH cohort, and less than 20 of them had
a performance status > 1. For that reason, any statistical
conclusions relating to performance status will not be valid due
to the very small sample size. Notably, RPV possessed a better
prognostic power when compared to the existing prognostic
markers including CA125 and the transcriptome-based molecular
subtype and potentially synergizes with existing CT-based
morphological approaches (Supplementary Tables 5–7; Supple-
mentary Note 1). Apart from prognosis, high RPV was found
significantly associated with primary chemotherapy resistance,
shorter PFS, and poor surgical outcome (Fig. 3e and Supplemen-
tary Figure 7g, Supplementary Note 1), suggesting RPV as a
potential predictive marker in HGSOC.
Taking advantage of the gene expression profiles collected
in parallel with radiomic profiles, we constructed a surrogate
marker of RPV based on a weighted list of mRNA expressions in
the TCGA validation dataset where both CT scans and gene
expression profiles were available (eRPV; Supplementary Note 1).
eRPV strongly correlated with RPV (r = 0.720) in the TCGA
validation dataset and significantly interacted with RPV in the
Cox regression model (Supplementary Figure 10c). It showed a
similar prognostic potential as RPV in two additional cohorts

 for stage, grade, residual disease, age and neo-adjuvant che-
motherapy). We thus considered eRPV as a surrogate of RPV and
subsequently used eRPV in a subset of the TCGA dataset without
publicly available CT scans, as an extension of RPV (Noted as
“eRPV” in Fig. 3d, e, Supplementary Figure 7a, 7c, 7e and h-j).
Overall, we observed RPV to be associated with OS, independent
of known clinical prognostic factors, suggesting that it may reflect
distinct aspects of clinically relevant variation across HGSOC.
Biological interpretation of the radiomic prognostic vector. To
understand tumor biological characteristics linked to RPV, we
evaluated enrichments of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways from Spearman correlation coeffi-
cients of gene expression with RPV (Fig. 3a, b; false discovery rate
(FDR) < 0.05); the full lists of pathways are given in Supple-
mentary Data 3 and 4.
We found that ECM−receptor interaction and focal adhesion
were the two pathways most significantly enriched for associa-
tions with high RPV. These two pathways contained ECM
components (TIMP3 (r = 0.530), COL11A1 (r = 0.460)) and focal
adhesion receptors (ITGA5 (r = 0.368), ITGB5 (r = 0.387)), and
from
previous
studies
both
pathways
were
enriched
in
stroma20,21. Accordingly, genes with expression correlated to
high RPV were significantly enriched for genes expressed in the
stromal
component
(Fig.
3c,
chi-squared
test
p < 0.0001).
Additionally, RPV was positively correlated with a stroma
marker, fibronectin, at the protein level in both the TCGA and
the HH cohorts (Fig. 3d and Supplementary Figure 7a).
Furthermore, high RPV was associated with high proportion of
tumor-associated stromal cells, evidenced from both histological
data (Fig. 3e) and stroma score estimated from transcriptomic
data22 (Supplementary Figure 4b). A lower tumor cell content is
inversely related to high stromal content. Consistent with
previous results, we noted that higher RPV was associated with
lower tumor cellularity (Fig. 3e) in the TCGA cohort and the
same trend was observed in the HH cohort (Supplementary
Figure 7d). These associations between molecular and histological
characteristics with RPV were also observed with eRPV in a
subset of the TCGA dataset without publicly available CT scans
(Supplementary Figure 7a, 7c and 7e).
Besides stroma-related pathways, a number of proliferation
and DNA damage response (DDR) pathways, including DNA
replication, cell cycle, mismatch repair, base excision repair,
nucleotide excision repair and homologous recombination, were
among the top pathways activated in the RPV-low tumors
(Fig. 3b). To verify the validity of the pathway analysis, we
analyzed reverse phase protein array (RPPA) data from both HH
and TCGA cohorts and found the expression of proliferation
and DDR pathway marker proteins including Stathmin 1, FoxM1
and Rad51 to be higher at the protein level in tumors with low
RPV in the two independent datasets (Fig. 3d and Supplementary
Figure 7a), which was consistent with our transcriptomic and
pathway analysis. Existence of highly proliferative cancer cells
with impaired DDR mechanism (e.g. TP53 mutation) could
elicit accumulation of DNA damage23. Accordingly, higher
tumor mutational burden and CNA burden were observed in
RPV-low tumors (Supplementary Figure 7k-7l). Collectively,
these molecular features suggest that RPV-low patients may
benefit from DDR inhibitors (PARPi) and immunotherapy (anti-
PD1/PD-L1)24. Potential alternative therapeutic targets based on
the molecular characteristics associated with RPV are listed in
Supplementary Table 8.
Molecular subtype, BRCA1/2 mutations and CCNE1 amplifica-
tion are well-established molecular characteristics contributing to
primary chemotherapy response and prognosis. However, they
were not found correlated with RPV, highlighting the indepen-
dent disease mechanisms associated with RPV (Fig. 3e; Supple-
mentary Note 1).
Overall, stromal phenotype on one hand, and proliferation and
DDR pathways on the other, were respectively activated in RPV-
high and RPV-low tumors, all of which are potential actionable
therapeutic targets in HGSOC.
The reliability and reproducibility of the radiomic profile. To
determine the reliability and reproducibility of the radiomic profile,
we assessed potential sources of error during radiomic data pre-
paration. Firstly, we assessed the batch effect of CT scanner types on
radiomic profile and RPV. Principal component analysis of the
radiomic profile for all tumors showed no association at all with the
five vendors or two types of matrix and was only moderately

 associated with the scan thickness (Fig. 4a and Supplementary
Figure 12a-12c; Range: 1–10 mm). Thus, RPV is deemed to be
unaffected by the types of CT scanner investigated.
To assess the reliability of radiomic data generated, we
investigated the feature-wise correlation in HH and TCGA cohorts
(Fig. 4b). A consistent feature-wise correlation across independent
studies is an indicator of high reliability. The feature-wise
correlation in HH and TCGA cohorts were strongly correlated
(r = 0.817, p < 0.0001, Pearson correlation), signifying a relatively
consistent structure within the radiomic profile compared with
molecular profiles from RPPA (Supplementary Figure 12c).
In the present study, the primary tumors from CT scans were
initially segmented by radiologists, then analyzed by the TexLab
2.0 software. The segmentation process could potentially cause
interobserver errors due to the manual nature of the procedure;
therefore, we investigated the effect of eight deformations (from
−4 to +4 voxels) of the original segmentations on RPV (Fig. 4c).
The difference between the deformed and original RPV are
shown for each deformation from 106 scans in Fig. 4d. We found
that erosion of the segmentation generally amplified the original
RPV and dilation had an opposite effect, which resulted in an
inverse correlation between the difference in RPV and increase
of voxels. Importantly, the variation in RPV was unremarkable
within the range of 1-voxel erosion (mean difference: 0.105,
sd: 0.167) and 3-voxel dilation (mean difference: −0.0418, sd:
0.125). The interobserver variation in RPV, determined from
segmentation made by two independent radiologists for 21 scans,
fitted well within this range (Supplementary Figure 12e).

 Discussion
In the present study, we obtained and analyzed a comprehensive
radiomic profile containing 657 features for 364 EOC cases in
total—the largest study of its kind for EOC—and we discovered a
novel radiomics-based prognostic signature, RPV, that not only
has strong prognostic power (HR > 3), but is also noninvasive and
readily accessible, compared to the existing molecular profiles and
clinical factors deemed prognostically relevant12,14. In contrast to
previous studies that lacked interpretation of the prognostic sig-
nature, we comprehensively profiled biological and clinical fea-
tures associated with RPV that will help guide future clinical
decision processes in a reliable and reproducible fashion.
Several previous studies have attempted to develop predictive
and prognostic tools based on molecular profiles from tumor
biopsies such as gene expression, DNA methylation, CNA, and
more recently microRNA and circulating tumor DNA12,14,15,25–27.
These molecular prognostic models are challenging to translate
into routine clinical use due to the invasiveness of a biopsy,
insufficient prognostic power due to the vast intratumor hetero-
geneity, high assay costs, and most importantly, the significant
time constraints that are associated with the molecular assay
procedures. The prognostic model we propose is simple, built
solely on the information extracted from a patient’s routine pre-
operative CT scan at the presentation of the disease and hence
readily accessible without additional costs or time delays, knowing
that majority of the HGSOC patients will have CT scans prior to
the treatment (compared to PET, MRI or ultrasound). The entire
primary ovarian mass is segmented, signifying that any prognostic
or biological information extracted is more representative of
the disease compared to a single site biopsy. Moreover, RPV is
stable across the CT scanner types and the segmentation process,
thus limiting the number of potential restrictions for clinical
exploitation in the future. We have constructed a software pipeline
which is able to compute the RPV of 80 EOC datasets within
5 min on a standard computer. Beyond RPV, the dataset could be
mined in a supervised manner for new gene- or protein-radiomics
interactions.
We employed manually engineered features as the main
component of radiomic analyses; this approach is backed by the
current literature in the field1. While some studies28 have started
to investigate the application of deep learning for radiomics via
the extraction of thousands of deep features from convolutional

 networks, the small sample size coupled with the curse of
dimensionality in machine learning pose a hurdle for proper
evaluation of deep learning features for radiomic analysis. The
availability of thousands of annotated or segmented 3D medical
datasets would allow for a more robust evaluation and open the
possibility for applying transfer learning on 3D medical images,
as is currently done with 2D images29–31.
RPV consists of four radiomic features: (a) FD_max_25HUgl
(coefficient:
−0.0876),
(b)
GLRLM_SRLGLE_LLL_25HUgl
(coefficient: 0.0869), (c) NGTDM_Contra_HLL_25HUgl (coeffi-
cient: 0.165), and (d) FOS_Imedian_LHH (coefficient: 0.250). All
the features appear to have approximately even weighting and
relate to tumor macro-architecture at the 25 Hounsfield Unit gray
level (and discrete wavelet filters). In biological terms, the indi-
vidual components of RPV combine to define the tumor-
mesoscopic structure: (a) maximal fractal dimension of the
tumor and its microenvironment, which was negatively correlated
with survival, together with the following positively correlated
features; (b) proportions of runs that have short lengths in the
low pass filtered image; a function which gives coarse low-density
textures, e.g. intermixed fibrotic stroma and tumor cells; (c) the
average visual contrast across the tumor weighted by sharpening
in the x-axis, and blurring in the y and z axes reflecting local
heterogeneity, and (d) the median of the distribution of voxel
intensities across the entire tumor weighted by blurring in the
x-axis and sharpening in the y and z axes, reflecting global
heterogeneity, respectively. A visual representation of the four
radiomic features is shown in Supplementary Figure 13.
In addition to building a prognostic model, we further
demonstrated that the radiomics-derived signature is closely
linked to a stromal phenotype and DNA-damage response
through genetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and histological ana-
lysis. This finding is consistent with the poor prognostic value of
stromal phenotype identified in many cancers including ovar-
ian32–36, pancreatic37, prostate38, colorectal35,39, gastric32, lung35
and breast cancer40. Tumor stroma consists of immune cells,
endothelial cells, fibroblasts and extracellular-matrix (ECM)41 all
of which could directly contribute to outcome via distinct
mechanisms in EOC42–45. We demonstrate, based on the strong
association between RPV and response to primary chemotherapy
or surgery, that patients with high RPV have a significantly high
risk of failing quality surgery or systemic strategies and suggest
that they possibly need to be directed towards alternative ther-
apeutic approaches including stroma modifying therapies (e.g.
ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03363867).
Interestingly, in our HGSOC cohort we did not observe a
strong association between RPV and any single cancer driver
events including ovarian cancer “molecular subtypes”, specific
gene mutations or CNA, suggesting that the RPV phenotype and
related poor prognosis may be shaped by noncanonical genetic
alterations or pathways.
There are some limitations of the present study: firstly, the
study had a retrospective design albeit with two independent
validation datasets. A future prospective study or analysis of
retrospective randomized clinical trial data is required to validate
RPV in a more general HGSOC population. Secondly, as the
stromal component contains a mixture of cells of different origins
and ECM composition, the exact elements in the stroma mea-
sured by RPV remain unclear. A study to associate RPV with each
component in stroma including fibroblast activation, immune cell
infiltration and ECM density is necessary to better understand the
basis of the prognostic power of RPV. In addition, EOC patients
often present with bilateral disease and one tumor was chosen
to represent the patient in this study. Further investigation
into heterogeneity in RPV for bilateral tumors may further help
optimize the prognostic model.
In summary, we have discovered and validated a novel math-
ematical descriptor of tumor phenotype and prognosis that
convincingly fulfills an unmet need in the management of
patients with EOC, and have demonstrated a disruptive tech-
nology that opens the way for multiple classifications of patients
and rapid patient entry into clinical trials at the point of care.
Methods
Patient cohort and biospecimen collection. This is an observational study of
patient data (including data related to fresh frozen tissue, imaging and clinical
annotations) from the Hammersmith Hospital (HH), Imperial College Healthcare
NHS Trust and from the TCGA study. All procedures involving human partici-
pants were done in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or
national research committee and with the principles of the 1964 Declaration of
Helsinki and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Ethical
approval for retrospective analysis of human data was obtained under the Ham-
mersmith and Queen Charlotte’s & Chelsea Research Ethics Committee approval
05/QO406/178 and informed consent was waived, typical for retrospective analysis
of anonymized imaging data.
EOC patients included in the Hammersmith cohort were treated at the
Hammersmith Hospital (HH), Imperial College London NHS Trust between
June 2004 and November 2015. The patients were identified based on the
availability of fresh frozen tumor tissue samples and preoperative CT images.
Patient demographics, surgical and tumor related data were collected
retrospectively from medical records and the multidisciplinary team (MDT) notes
by the clinical members of the team are summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
PFS and OS were defined as the time from the date of surgery until the date of first
relapse or death, respectively. Staging was defined according to FIGO-criteria for
ovarian epithelial carcinoma. Optimal debulking was defined by postoperative
residual disease < 10 mm since this criterion was applied to majority of the
retrospective patients. Primary chemotherapy resistance was defined as stable
disease, a partial response or progressive disease during the first-line
chemotherapy.
Tumor cellularity was quantified from hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections
by an experienced pathologist. Based on the multidimensional scaling analysis we
performed on the RPPA data, only samples with more than 30% tumor cellularity
were included in the RPPA analysis.
A subset of EOC patients from TCGA study were used as the validation cohort.
The preoperative CT images for these cases were downloaded from the cancer
imaging archive46 (http://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/). This was a multicenter
cohort with patients originating from Memorial Sloan Kettering (30 cases), Mayo
Clinic—Rochester (4 cases), University of Pittsburgh (10 cases), UCSF (16 cases)
and Washington University (9 cases). The clinical and histological data were
downloaded from UCSC cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/).
Clinical and surgical pathways. The management of all patients and the indi-
cations for surgery were discussed within a multidisciplinary team as per the UK
National Health Service (NHS) guidelines. All operations were performed through
a midline laparotomy by a specialized dedicated multidisciplinary team within
a maximal effort approach aiming to achieve total macroscopic tumor clearance.
Standard surgical procedures included peritoneal cytology, extrafascial hyster-
ectomy, bilateral salpingoophorectomy and infra-gastric omentectomy. When
indicated, additional procedures, such as dissection of macroscopically suspicious
pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes, bowel resection, splenectomy, diaphragmatic
stripping/resection and/or partial resection of other affected organs (e.g. urinary
bladder, liver/liver capsule, pancreas, lesser sack) were performed in order to
achieve optimal tumor debulking. No systematic pelvic and paraaortic lymph node
dissection was performed routinely in the absence of suspicious bulky lymph nodes
(<1 cm).
Ninety-seven percent of patients were treated with a platinum-based
chemotherapy mainly in a combination regimen with paclitaxel or as monotherapy
in isolated cases.
Clinical follow-up of patients. Patients were regularly evaluated at the end of their
treatment for evidence of disease recurrence. Clinical examination and CA-125
assessment (if the preoperative value was elevated) were performed every 3 months
for the first 2 years and then 6-monthly. A CT/MRI-scan was ordered if the above
examinations revealed any pathology. An isolated CA-125 increase was not
regarded as a recurrence.
CT segmentation and radiomic analysis. As patients were referred to the cancer
center from a network of cancer units, contrast-enhanced CT scans were acquired at
multiple institutions using different manufacturers and different imaging protocols.
For both the HH and the TCGA datasets, the primary tumor masses were
segmented separately by experienced radiologists (M.A., G.A.) using ITK snap
(Version 3.2, 2015) and then all segmentations were checked in consensus with a
radiologist with over 16 years’ experience of ovarian cancer imaging (A.R.). We
included the entire primary tubo-ovarian mass (cystic and solid components). If both

 adnexae were involved, then both were included in the analysis, either as two separate
segmentations or as a single segmentation if the mass was confluent. We segmented
the entire primary mass including cystic and solid components, but excluded ascites.
The segmentations only included tissue that was considered highly likely to be cancer
by the expert reader. Areas of doubt on CT were not included in any segmentations.
Inter-observer variation was also measured by comparing independent segmentation
from two radiologists using the TCGA cohort.
For this study, the primary tumor mass segmentations were used as input for
the in-house texture analysis software package (TextLAB 2.0) developed in
MATLAB 2015b (Mathworks Inc., Nathick, Massachusetts, USA)16.
Using methodologies for feature extractions1,47–53, we defined 657 radiomic
image features that describe tumor characteristics. The features can be divided into
several groups: 1. Shape and Size features; 2. First-order statistics; 3. Second-order
statistics; 4. Wavelet features.
The first group relates to statistics based on the shape of the tumor, e.g.
compactness or sphericity. The second group quantified tumor voxel intensity
characteristics. Group 3 consists of textural features that quantify different measures
of three-dimensional intratumoral heterogeneity. The wavelet features group
calculates the features in groups 2 and 3 after performing wavelet decompositions
of the original image using high-pass or low-pass filters from the coiflet 1 family of
wavelets. All feature algorithms were implemented within MATLAB.
Transcriptomic, proteomic and copy-number analysis. Frozen tumor tissue
pieces (n = 314) were placed into ceramic bead tubes (Stretton Scientific) for
protein extraction by the Functional Proteomics RPPA Core Facility, MD
Anderson, USA. Protein concentration was determined following extraction and
adjusted to 1.5 μg/μl. Proteins were denatured by 1% SDS plus beta-
Mercaptoethanol and serially diluted for subsequent Reverse Phase Protein arrays.
For each tumor in the study, one frozen tumor piece was placed into a tube
containing 500 μl RLT buffer from RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) and one Retsch 6 mm
steel core bead. Tubes were placed into well adapters of a Tissuelyser II (QIAGEN)
and tissues were lysed at 15 Hz for 2 min. Tubes were centrifuged briefly and 320 μl
was removed for subsequent RNA extraction using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN)
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentrations were quantified
using the Bioanalyzer system (Agilent).
For DNA extraction, 450 μl of Buffer ATL from the QIAAMP DNA kit
(QIAGEN) was added to the centrifuge tube, and DNA was extracted following the
manufacturer’s instructions and quantified using QuBit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
RPPA arrays were carried out and analyzed by MD Anderson Cancer Center54.
Briefly, protein lysates were diluted and loaded onto nitrocellulose-coated slides
that had been preconjugated with primary antibodies. Each protein was then
visualized via a colorimetric reaction and quantified by Array-Pro Analyzer. The
raw expression values were then normalized to protein loading and quantified by
means of standard curves. Log2 transformed and median-centered data were used
for the downstream analyses.
To perform molecular subtyping, total RNA from each individual case was
reverse transcribed into cDNA, followed by amplification with a pool of indexed
primers that target a predefined gene list (42 genes)13. The primers were selected
from the Illumina DesignStudios. The cleaned PCR product underwent QC by
Tapestation (Agilent) to confirm the amplicon sizes. Forty-eight samples were
multiplexed in one single MiSeq run. SR 50 bp were used to generate approximately
20 million reads per run.
Copy-number estimates for CCNE1 in 131 tumor samples from the HH cohort
were obtained through quantitative qPCR10. ΔCt values for tumor samples (CCNE1
relative to the endogenous control LINE1) were normalized to equivalent ΔCt
values from reference (normal Fallopian tube cell line DNA) with an assumed
CCNE1 copy number of 2.
Unsupervised clustering and signature discovery. A simple spectral cluster
analysis was performed using radiomic data from patients with both radiomic and
genomic copy-number data available. First a similarity measure was computed for
each patient with radiomic and CNA profiles as the average Spearman correlation
coefficient. The profiles of pair-wise similarity were then used to compute the
Euclidean distance between each pair of patients. Visual inspection of a hierarchical
clustering dendrogram was used to select three clusters of patients, so that patients
from a given cluster tended to share correlated radiomic profiles.
The number of genes affected by CNA was calculated for each tumor sample, so
that the distribution of the logarithm of these numbers could be compared for
tumors from patients belonging to different clusters.
Kaplan−Meier curves were drawn for PFS and OS using the “survfit” function
from the “survival” package in R. The statistical significance of the difference in
these survival measures across the three patient clusters was calculated using the
log-rank test implemented in the “survdiff” function.
Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of radiomic profiles were performed using
hclust and cutree function in R 3.3.1. The raw radiomic data were firstly scaled by
mean and centered. Pearson correlation-based distance and complete linkage was
used to obtain the final clusters indicated in Fig. 1e. The resulting clusters were
confirmed by repeating the clustering analysis using Euclidean’s distance. The
optimization of the radiomic clusters is indicated in Supplementary Figure 14. The
heatmap was generated using the “heatmap.plus” package in R 3.3.1.
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) analysis was performed
to build a prognostic model for OS using radiomic data. We first selected for the
discovery dataset (HH discovery) a group of HGSOC patients who had primary
debulking surgery as well as patients not in the unsupervised subgroup 2 (which had
different slice thickness compared to other subgroups, Supplementary Figure 14). All
the other HGSOC patients were used as the HH validation dataset and the HGSOC
patients in the TCGA cohort were used as the TCGA validation dataset. We selected a
large pilot dataset for discovery (HH discovery, n = 136) and the number of patients
in the two validation datasets fulfilled sample size estimate (73 cases needed after
accepting the alpha of 0.05 and beta of 0.25. HR of 2.78, 31.6% cases in the high-risk
group, median survival of 5 years in the low-risk group and median follow-up as 5
years). To generate a prognostic model of OS, a univariate Cox regression was
performed between individual radiomic features and OS, which was adjusted for
stage, slice thickness and residual disease in the HH discovery dataset. Since it was not
possible to decide the more prognosis-related tumor for bilateral tumors and we had
demonstrated close similarity between the two tumors, we included both bilateral
tumors at the model-building stage. The radiomic features with FDR < 5% were
selected as input for LASSO regression using glmnet package in R 3.3.1. “Cox” was set
as the family in the model. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed using cv.glmnet
function to select lambda minimum to give the minimum cross-validated error. The
resulting four radiomic features with coefficients were used to calculate a predictive
index—RPV—for each patient. The RPV was used to perform subsequent continuous
Cox regression and Kaplan−Meier analysis with OS and PFS. For patients with
bilateral tumors, the tumor that gave the higher RPV was selected since it resulted in
better performance compared with the one with lower RPV. After considering the
distribution of RPV and number of patients in each subgroup, K-means clustering
was applied to split the patients into three subgroups (low risk: min−0.0950, medium
risk: 0.0950–0.658, high risk: 0.658−max). The same criteria were used to obtain
subgroups in the validation cohorts. For validation, the radiomic data from the TCGA
dataset and the HH validation dataset were initially scaled and centered. The RPV was
calculated using the four radiomic features with coefficients derived from the
discovery set. For those cases with bilateral tumors which resulted in two RPV values,
the higher RPV was selected for the survival analysis. For multiple Cox regression of
RPV, the slice thickness was introduced as additional variable. Only cases with
complete clinical information (stage, age and postoperative residual disease) and slice
thickness were included in the multivariable Cox regression analysis. REMARK
guidelines were followed when reporting RPV as a prognostic marker in this study55.
Similar procedure was applied to generate eRPV with some modifications. Gene
expression profile from Affymetrix HT Human Genome U133a (Level 2) and
Agilent 244K custom gene expression G4502A_07_3 (Level 3) from the TCGA
study were downloaded from UCSC cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.
edu/) and TCGA data portal (https://cancergenome.nih.gov/). Spearman
correlation was applied to obtain a list of genes correlated with RPV (FDR < 0.25
for Affymetrix and FDR < 0.1 for Agilent). The gene list obtained was used to
perform feature selection and linear regression with RPV using “glmnet” package.
“gaussian” was set as the family in the model and a tenfold cross-validation was
applied. The resulting weighted gene lists contributing to eRPV are given in
Supplementary Data 5 and 6.
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed for RPV-correlated genes
in the TCGA dataset. The Level 3 RNA-sequencing dataset of EOC from the TCGA
project was downloaded from UCSC cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.
edu/) and the gene-level transcription estimates were obtained in reads per kilobase
million. Spearman correlation coefficient was determined from RPV and all the
genes respectively. The full list of correlation coefficients was used as the pre-
ranked list in GSEA 2.1.0 with KEGG database, 1000 of permutations and classic
enrichment statistic.
Differential gene expression between tumor and stroma in HGSOC was
analyzed using limma package from Bioconductor in R 3.3.1. The Robust Multi-
array Average (RMA) normalized microarray dataset (GSE40595) was downloaded
from GEO (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The empirical Bayes moderated t-
statistics were computed comparing gene expression from HGSOC stroma and
tumor epithelial component. The p value derived was adjusted for multiple testing
using Benjamini–Hochberg procedure.
Statistical analysis. Standard statistical analysis was applied to all the figures as
appropriate and indicated in the figure legends. All samples were used once.
Multiple testing was corrected with FDR method. All the statistical analyses were
conducted in R 3.3.1.
