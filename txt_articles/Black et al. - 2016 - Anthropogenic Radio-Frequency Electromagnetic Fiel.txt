Abstract
Anecdotal and clinical reports have suggested that radio-frequency electromagnetic fields
(RF EMFs) may serve as a trigger for neuropathic pain. However, these reports have been
widely disregarded, as the epidemiological effects of electromagnetic fields have not been
systematically proven, and are highly controversial. Here, we demonstrate that anthropo-
genic RF EMFs elicit post-neurotomy pain in a tibial neuroma transposition model. Behav-
ioral assays indicate a persistent and significant pain response to RF EMFs when
compared to SHAM surgery groups. Laser thermometry revealed a transient skin tempera-
ture increase during stimulation. Furthermore, immunofluorescence revealed an increased
expression of temperature sensitive cation channels (TRPV4) in the neuroma bulb, sug-
gesting that RF EMF-induced pain may be due to cytokine-mediated channel dysregulation
and hypersensitization, leading to thermal allodynia. Additional behavioral assays were per-
formed using an infrared heating lamp in place of the RF stimulus. While thermally-induced
pain responses were observed, the response frequency and progression did not recapitu-
late the RF EMF effects. In vitro calcium imaging experiments demonstrated that our RF
EMF stimulus is sufficient to directly contribute to the depolarization of dissociated sensory
neurons. Furthermore, the perfusion of inflammatory cytokine TNF-α resulted in a signifi-
cantly higher percentage of active sensory neurons during RF EMF stimulation. These
results substantiate patient reports of RF EMF-pain, in the case of peripheral nerve injury,
while confirming the public and scientific consensus that anthropogenic RF EMFs engender
no adverse sensory effects in the general population.

 Introduction
Anthropogenic electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have become a ubiquitous presence in modern
life. A broad spectral band of EMF frequencies (50 Hz–5 GHz) are now passing around us and
through us, and are generated by sources ranging from electricity transport to mobile commu-
nication devices. While we have all undoubtedly benefited from the wide-ranging applications
of commercial electronics, there is a growing social and scientific concern that persistent expo-
sure to radio- and microwave-frequency (RF/MWF) EMFs may engender unforeseen adverse
health effects in vulnerable subsets of our population.
Over the past thirty years, there have been numerous reports published on the epidemiolog-
ical, animal, and cellular-level effects of RF EMF exposure [1–3], with the majority of these
studies being conducted in vitro and focused on evaluating the potential relationship between
cell phone usage and the incidence of certain types of cancer [4–6]. Many conclusions drawn
from this field of study remain highly controversial [7,8], but sufficient evidence regarding
EMF-tissue interactions has resulted in the adoption of national and international standards
for health and occupational EMF exposure. More recently, there have also been anecdotal,
case, and clinical reports that magnetic and electromagnetic fields of various frequencies may
serve as a trigger for neuropathic and post-amputation pain [9–11].
Whether anthropogenic RF EMFs are capable of triggering post-neurotomy pain is a ques-
tion of enormous clinical importance, as there are currently 1.7 million amputees living in the
United States alone. Aside from the loss of function, approximately 20–30% of this population
endures chronic, debilitating pain associated with the formation of benign peripheral nerve
tumors in their residual limbs, called amputation neuromas [12]. This type of neuroma is the
result of regenerating and sprouting axons, which grow into surrounding connective tissues
following nerve transection. The resulting neuroma bulb, which is comprised primarily of
unmyelinated and thinly myelinated (C and Aδ) nerve fibers, is well-known to respond to
chemical, mechanical, and thermal stimuli with hypersensitivity [12–14]. However, to date,
there has been no independent, reproducible confirmation that anthropogenic RF EMFs elicit
post-neurotomy pain in either humans or animal models.
Here, we evaluate the claim that anthropogenic-strength RF EMFs are capable of eliciting
post-neurotomy pain by adopting a modification of the tibial neuroma transposition (TNT)
model for behavioral assessment of post-neurotomy pain in rats. Adult Wistar rats were ran-
domly assigned to either receive the TNT or SHAM surgical procedure. Researchers blinded to
the surgical groups then scored pain responses on a graded scale as animals were exposed to a
circularly polarized RF antenna (915 MHz at 756 ± 8.5 mW/mm2). Measurements of skin tem-
perature during RF EMF exposure revealed a transient increase of 2.1 ± 0.7°C during stimula-
tion. We hypothesized that RF EMF-induced pain responses may be attributable to thermal
allodynia, which results from the local secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β). Both TNF-α and IL-1β have
been shown to contribute to allodynia [15,16] and thermal hyperalgesia [17] through the dysre-
gulation of temperature-sensitive channel expression [18–20], such as members of the tran-
sient receptor potential (TRP) family. Histological staining for TRPV4, a non-selective cation
channel which is highly implicated in thermal sensation and various neuropathic pain states
[21–23], was carried out in neuroma and uninjured tibial nerve sections. In parallel, calcium
imaging experiments were conducted on dissociated dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons in
the presence and absence of TNF-α in order to determine whether the RF EMF stimulus was
sufficient to directly depolarize sensory neurons. Our findings confirm that RF EMFs are capa-
ble of eliciting post-neurotomy pain in an animal model.

 Results
RF EMFs elicit post-neurotomy pain
Twenty female adult Wistar rats were divided into two groups. Sixteen animals underwent the
TNT procedure, while the remaining 4 animals received a SHAM surgery, as described in
‘Methods’. The TNT surgery resulted in neuroma bulb formation in all animals as exemplified
in Fig 1B. Following TNT and SHAM surgeries, animals were coded and individually exposed
to a circularly polarized RF EMF antenna (915 MHz at 756 ± 8.5 mW/m2) for 10 minutes, once
per week for 8 weeks. The RF EMF stimulus was attenuated to deliver an average power density
equal to that measured at 39 m from a local cell phone tower (763 mW/m2 at 39 m; S1 Fig),
which we selected as an example of the maximum anthropogenic EMF power density a person
might encounter outside of select occupational settings.
The summed response score for each animal is plotted as a function of time in Fig 2A and
2B. Beginning on postoperative week 1, 47% of animals from the TNT group exhibited at least
one pain response during RF EMF stimulation. By postoperative week 4, this percentage
increased to 88%, which is consistent with expected neuroma growth and sensitization. In
sharp contrast, only one animal from the SHAM group exhibited a single behavioral response
during RF EMF stimulation, observed at week 1. No additional pain responses in the SHAM
group were observed. The mean response score for the TNT group differed significantly from
the SHAM group beginning on postoperative week 3 (p = 0.049) and persisting on week 4
(p = 0.006). These results demonstrate for the first time that anthropogenic-strength RF EMFs
are sufficient to trigger post-neurotomy pain in a behaving animal model.
To confirm that pain responses were nerve-mediated, RF EMF assays were carried out one
day following week 4 assays while nerve conduction was blocked by a subdermal injection of
lidocaine (100 μl, 1 g/ml), administered at the neuroma site. The mean response score of the
TNT group was significantly reduced following lidocaine injection when compared to week 4
response scores (p = 1.16 x 10−4). These results demonstrate that RF EMF-induced pain
response is the result of depolarizing nerve activity.
RF EMF-induced pain is chronic and persists following neuroma bulb
resection
One day following Lidocaine trials, animals from the TNT group were randomly divided into
two additional groups: TNT-SHAM (TNT-S, N = 8) and TNT-Bulb Resection (TNT-BR,
N = 8). TNT-BR animals underwent surgery to dissect and remove the neuroma bulb. TNT-S
animals and SHAM-S animals received identical pre- and post- operative treatment, but did
not have their neuroma bulbs removed or their tibial nerves transected, respectively. Pain
response assays resumed for weeks 5–8 from the date of initial TNT surgery and were repeated
on one additional, chronic time point (week 28).
Surprisingly, RF EMF-induced pain responses persisted in weeks 5–8 for animals in both
the TNT-S and TNT-BR groups, while no pain responses were observed in the SHAM-S group
in weeks 5–8 or on week 28 (Fig 2B). The mean response scores for the TNT-S and TNT-BR
groups both differed significantly from the SHAM-S group consistently from week 5 onward.
While there was no significant difference between the mean response scores of the TNT-S and
TNT-BR groups in weeks 5–8, the two groups differed significantly in week 28. At this point,
the TNT-S group showed pain responses similar to those observed in the first four weeks of the
study, whereas the TNT-BR group showed significantly higher pain responses (p = 0.005).
These results suggest that neuroma bulb resection may not be an effective intervention for RF

 EMF-induced post-neurotomy pain in either the short- or long-term. In fact, it may exacerbate
post-neurotomy pain by introducing a second injury to the nerve.
RF EMFs induce an increase in skin temperature
Skin temperature measurements were acquired by laser-thermometer (TW2, ThermoWorks,
USA) from 10 randomly selected animals during 10 minute baseline (antenna off), stimulus
(antenna on), and recovery (antenna off) intervals. During the stimulus interval, we measured
a mean transient skin temperature increase of 2.1 ± 0.7°C, which returned to near-baseline lev-
els (31.5 ± 2.2°C) during the recovery interval (Fig 2C). Therefore, all animals were observed
for an additional 10 minutes following stimulus in order to account for residual response scores
during tissue cooling. Fig 2D shows the ratio of Recovery/Stimulus response scores as a func-
tion of time. This ratio continuously increased from 0.43 in week 1 to 0.92 in week 4. Following
the second surgery, the Recovery/Stimulus ratio is again comparable to week 1 (0.48) and
increases over time until week 8 (0.65). Importantly, this data serves as a secondary confirma-
tion that pain responses are due to RF EMF stimulation, as the summed stimulus-interval pain
score is consistently and considerably higher than that of the recovery interval. Furthermore,
this data suggests that the second surgical procedure partially disrupts the mechanism respon-
sible for increasing residual pain response through the first 4 weeks.
Thermal stimulus elicits post-neurotomy pain, but does not completely
recapitulate the RF EMF effects
In order to compare RF EMF-exposure to direct thermal stimulation (a known trigger for post-
neurotomy pain), animals were individually exposed to a 125 W infrared heating source for 5
minutes, once per week for 8 weeks. Exposure to the infrared source resulted in a transient
mean skin temperature increase of 4.8 ± 0.4°C above baseline. From postoperative week 1 to
week 4, the percentage of TNT animals which exhibited at least one behavioral response during
thermal stimulation increased from 19% to 50%. Pain responses persisted over all 4 weeks and
the mean response score increased each consecutive week through week 4 (Fig 3A), consistent
with neuroma growth. No animals from the SHAM group exhibited even a single behavioral
response to the thermal stimulus throughout the duration of the study. Lidocaine injection was

 found to be somewhat effective in reducing pain response, though the difference was not statis-
tically significant. These findings are in agreement with previous reports that temperatures
below what would typically be perceived as noxious heat stimuli (> 47°C) are capable of trig-
gering neuroma pain. It is important to note, however, that direct thermal stimulation was less
effective at eliciting post-neurotomy pain when compared to RF EMF (i.e. 50% versus 80%
response by week 4), even at a higher temperature increase (4.8°C versus 2.1°C). This suggests
that, while there may be a component of RF-induced neuroma pain attributable to tempera-
ture, additional mechanisms may be involved.
Temperature-induced pain is persistent following neuroma bulb
resection
Temperature-evoked pain persisted in the TNT-S and TNT-BR groups throughout the dura-
tion of the study, while no pain responses were observed in the SHAM-S group (Fig 3B). The
mean response scores for the TNT-S and TNT-BR groups differed significantly from the
SHAM-S group beginning on week 6 and persisting through week 8 (p < 0.05), yet there was
no significant difference between TNT-S and TNT-BR groups in week 5–8 or week 28. These
results indicate that bulb resection exacerbates post-neurotomy pain over the short term, with
pain scores returning to pre-resection values between weeks 8 and 28.
Thermal stimulation induces residual pain
To account for the potential effects due to delays in skin temperature cooling (Fig 3C), pain
responses were scored for an additional 5 minutes, referred to here as the ‘Recovery’ interval.
As expected, direct thermal stimulus resulted in residual pain responses during the recovery
interval. In general, the Recovery/ Stimulus ratio for thermal stimulation was higher than for
RF EMF stimulation at each time point, with this value exceeding 1 on weeks 3 and 5 (Fig 3D).
This is likely correlative to delayed cooling caused by greater temperature increase. Addition-
ally, the time dependence trend of the thermal Recovery/Stimulus ratio does not follow that of
the RF EMF, implying that a different functional mechanism is responsible for residual
responses in the case of the two stimuli.
Neuroma formation results in increased expression of TRPV4 channels
Our previous results suggested that RF EMF-induced pain is mediated by thermal allodynia.
Allodynia following nerve transection results from the local secretion of inflammatory cyto-
kines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1β). Both TNF-
α and IL-1β have been shown to contribute to allodynia [15,16] and thermal hyperalgesia [17],
specifically through the dysregulation of temperature-sensitive channel expression [18–20],
and the heat-potentiation of sensory afferents [20,24]. Several families of temperature-sensitive
ion channels are subject to such dysregulation, including members of the TRP family. Since the
temperature increase associated with RF EMF stimulus is not tantamount to a noxious heat
stimulus, we hypothesized that TRPV4 channels may be involved, as these channels are
expressed in sensory nerve afferents and dorsal root ganglia, are activated by temperature
ramps within the physiological range (< 40°C), and are implicated in neuropathic pain
[21,25].
We confirmed by immunolabeling of 8 week old neuromas a four-fold increase in the
expression of TRPV4 channels in the neurom bulb (1.7 X 105 puncta/mm2; p < 2.1 X10-9) ver-
sus the contralateral healthy tibial nerve (0.4 X 105 puncta/mm2; Fig 4G). As expected, DAPI
staining showed a significant recruitment of non-neuronal cells to the neuroma bulb compared

 to the healthy tibial nerve (Fig 4G). This data suggests that RF EMF-induced postampuation
pain may be mediated by thermal activation of TRPV4 channels.
RF EMF evokes higher-threshold calcium spikes in dissociated DRG
neurons
The cellular mechanism by which tissue heating, particularly in combination with nerve injury,
elicits pain may involve a number of different cells including macrophages, Schwann cells,
fibroblasts, as well as sensory axons. In order to determine whether RF EMF stimulus is suffi-
cient to modulate the spontaneous activity of primary sensory neurons, we performed calcium
imaging experiments on dissociated DRG neurons. The cells were incubated with Fluo-3 and
imaged at 1 Hz (20x, 488 nm excitation) in an environmentally controlled (37°C, 5% CO2)
stage-top incubator, 7 days following culture. The evaluation intervals followed those used in
the behavioral assays (2 minute baseline, 10 minute stimulus, and 10 minutes recovery). As a
negative control, calcium imaging experiments were also conducted with no RF EMF applied
(Fig 5).
Fig 5A is a representative image of dissociated DRG neurons following incubation with
Fluo-3. ΔF/F plots (Fig 5B) revealed that spontaneous spikes in intracellular calcium concentra-
tion were common in cases of No RF as well as when RF was applied. A significantly higher
spiking rate was observed when RF EMF stimulus was applied (spike threshold = 0.35, Fig 5C).
This result suggests that RF EMF stimulation is sufficient to directly elicit higher threshold
activity in dissociated DRG neurons without functional sensitization.
RF EMF-induced depolarization is exacerbated by TNF-α
In order to better simulate the conditions of inflammatory injury, calcium imaging experi-
ments were also conducted in the acute and chronic presence of inflammatory cytokine, TNF-
α. In acute experiments, TNF-α was perfused into the DRG culture over 1 minute to reach a
final concentration of 10 ng/ml. This concentration has been shown to cause increased sensitiv-
ity in both acute and chronic applications. A 25% percentage increase in the number of spiking
cells in response to RF EMF + TNF-α (Fig 5D) at minute 4 was observed. The increased values
induced by TNF-α were statistically different as indicated by a Paired Wilcoxon Signed Rank

 Test (p = 0.03). In chronic experiments, DRG neurons cultured with TNF-α for 50 hours
showed an increased average spiking rate and amplitude compared to acute or control experi-
ments. However, no significant difference in spiking rate, spiking amplitude, or active cell per-
centage was observed between the RF Applied and No RF groups (data not shown). These
results suggest that RF EMF in combination with acute TNF-α results in a greater number of
active sensory neurons, but that chronic exposure to this cytokine alone is not sufficient to
cause RF EMF hypersensitivity.
It has been shown that calcium activity among glial cells can modulate the activity threshold
of surrounding sensory neurons. Therefore, modulated resting potentials for non-neuronal
cells may affect potentiation of sensory neurons. S2A–S2H Fig shows two sets of non-neuronal
DRG cells present in cultures during chronic TNF-α calcium imaging experiments. The intra-
cellular calcium concentration of these cells was found to gradually shift throughout the dura-
tion of RF EMF exposure. Cells shown in S2A–S2D Fig exhibited an approximate 150%
increase in fluorescence intensity, while cells shown in S2E–S2H Fig exhibit a nearly 100%
decrease in fluorescence intensity. Such dramatic and sustained shifts in intracellular calcium
concentration baselines among non-neuronal cells during and following RF EMF stimulation
may influence the activity of adjacent sensory neurons in vivo.
Discussion
The World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) have adopted occupational and environmental EMF exposure
thresholds based on a tissue or organ system’s specific energy absorption rate (SAR) [26].
Therefore, current safety standards are closely related to a tissue’s temperature rise due to
direct EMF absorption. However, these standards and guidelines largely disregard potential
effects suffered by those subject to injured or malfunctioning tissues. To date, clinical or case
reports of EMF-induced post-neurotomy or neuropathic pain have been widely dismissed.
This is likely due to the fact that numerous provocation studies have been conducted address-
ing the anecdotal self-reporting of electro-magnetic hypersensitivity among the general popu-
lation. These studies have provided no evidence that those with reported EMF hypersensitivity
are able to detect the presence of EMFs or that they suffer any physiological stress during EMF
provocation trials [27,28].
For the first time, in a blinded animal study, we have confirmed anecdotal reports that
anthropogenic RF EMFs are capable of triggering post-neurotomy pain. Furthermore, we have
confirmed that RF EMF-induced pain signaling is, in part, nerve mediated, as pain was success-
fully interrupted by local lidocaine anesthesia. However, the fact that RF EMF pain was
induced as early as postoperative week 1 suggests that pain responses are not completely
dependent on the formation of a ‘matured’ neuroma bulb, since painful neuromas typically
require several weeks, or even months, to form and become symptomatic. For the same reason,
it is also unlikely that pain responses are due to ephaptic cross talk between regenerated unmy-
elinated nerve fibers at the site of the neuroma bulb. These results do not, however, rule out the
contribution of neuroma formation in the progression of RF EMF pain. On the contrary, it cla-
rifies the fact that neuropathy results in a massive disruption of the perineurium, exposing
nerve fibers to inflammatory cytokines and exacerbating pain response in the acute inflamma-
tory phase following amputation. This initial inflammatory response decreases with time as the
blood-nerve barrier is re-established. Her we show that developed neuromas are comprised
mostly of thinly and unmyelinated axons, which expressed heightened levels of TRPV4 chan-
nels. These non-specific cation channels are dysregulated and hypersensitized following expo-
sure to inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β, and can therefore mediate thermal

 allodynia due to even mild temperature increases. This type of alteration in channel expression
and function is not exclusive to nerve transection injuries. Therefore, this study suggests that
the criteria for RF EMF sensitization may be satisfied by other types of acute and/or inflamma-
tory nerve injury and a more general category of neuropathic pain states.
Our findings that a 915 Hz RF EMF stimulus elicits pain in acute nerve injuries, as well as in
developing neuromas, suggests that this approach may be an effective tool for the diagnosis of
developing neuropathic hypersensitivity and serve as an early endorsement for post-neurot-
omy intervention strategies. To fully determine the use of this approach as a diagnostic tool,
future studies should compare this type of RF EMF to other available technologies such as tran-
scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which has been shown to be an effective tool for diagnos-
ing ‘active’ stump neuroma following amputation surgery [29].
In vitro experiments demonstrated that DRG sensory neurons are directly susceptive to a
significant increase in the frequency of high-threshold calcium transients during RF EMF stim-
ulus. Importantly, this response was exacerbated by the presence of inflammatory cytokine
TNF-α, as a higher percentage of DRG neurons were active during RF EMF stimulus. This sug-
gests that several, decentralized mechanisms may be activated in concert by RF EMF stimulus;
both thermal and athermal. Recently, several athermal effects of RF EMF exposure have been
reported, including the upregulation of heat shock proteins [30], decreased cell proliferation
[31], DNA damage [32], and proteome alterations [33]. The conclusiveness of these athermal
findings, however, has suffered from a lack of independent reproducibility, most probably asso-
ciated with the lack of consistent dosimetry in what is still a burgeoning field of study [34,35].
This is especially important since the few existing systematic parametric studies suggesting
therapeutic or deleterious effects of EMFs report that these effects occur within both amplitude
and frequency ‘windows’ [6,36]. One such study demonstrated that room temperature applica-
tion of 915 MHz EMF resulted in significant condensation of chromatin, closely mimicking the
effects of heat shock (at 41°C) [36].
Conclusion
Our animal study supports anecdotal reports indicating that RF EMFs serve as a trigger for
post-neurotomy pain. Further, it suggests that those who have suffered a nerve injury or other
types of peripheral nerve pathology may be prone to RF EMF-induced pain. The fact that unin-
jured animals showed no response to RF EMF in this study is also in agreement with most sci-
entific reports and the overwhelming view that, under normal circumstances, anthropogenic
EMFs in the reported range causes no pain. Thus, this study offers a possible explanation for
contradicting accounts on evoked pain by RF EMF and highlights nerve pathology as the cru-
cial contributing factor to RF EMF-induced symptoms. These findings may prove valuable in
developing a patient’s pain management protocol and inform future studies of EMF-pain
phenotyping.
Materials and Methods
Animal model and TNT surgery
In order to simulate amputation in a behaving animal model, we have adopted a modification
of the tibial-neuroma transposition surgery described in Dorsi, et al [37]. Our reasons for mod-
ifying the surgical procedure put forth by Dorsi, et al were two fold. (1) We believed that
approaching the sciatic nerve through the separation in the vastus lateralis and biceps femoris
made for a less aggressive procedure, since it did not ultimately require tunneling through tis-
sues to access the tibial branch translocation point. (2) Thermal and RF EMF behavioral
response assays were predicated on field absorption. It was, therefore, desirable for the

 transected tibial translocation position to be more ‘accessible’ to the stimuli. From 20 Wistar
rats, 16 were randomly selected to receive the tibial-neuroma transposition (TNT) surgery, and
the remaining animals (N = 4) received SHAM surgeries, as described in the following section.
Briefly, animals were anesthetized with 1.5% isoflurane and the left thigh was shaved and
sterilized with 70% ethanol and povidone-iodine. A lateral incision was made in the left hind
limb, starting approximately two centimeters caudal to the hip bone and in a plane parallel to
the femur. The vastus lateralis and biceps femoris muscles were separated, exposing the sciatic
nerve, and approximately one centimeter of the tibial branch was isolated. The tibial branch
was transected at the level of the popliteal artery and transposed atop the quadriceps muscle,
adjacent to the hip bone, and fixed with a 9–0 nylon suture. We then affronted the biceps femo-
ris with chromic gut thread and the skin was closed with stainless steel staples.
The remaining animals (N = 4) received a SHAM surgical procedure, wherein the tibial
nerve was exposed, but not transected. All animals received identical pre- and post-operative
care, which included postoperative application of triple-antibiotic ointment, an injection of
sustained-release buprenorphine (1 mg/kg SC, QTD), and daily injections of prophylactic anti-
biotic (Cefazolin, 1 mg/kg IM) for one week. Animals were housed, one animal per cage, in a
climate controlled room (60% humidity) under a 10:14 hr light/dark cycle, with free access to
suitable food and water. The health and well-being of all animals was monitored daily by
research staff and once per week by a veterinarian. Following the completion of behavioral
assays, animals were sedated by 1.5% isoflurane and euthanized by injection of sodium pento-
barbital (120 mg/kg). All handling and housing measures, surgical procedures, and behavioral
assays were approved by the University of Texas at Arlington and the University of Texas at
Dallas Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
Behavioral response scoring
Behavioral response assays began one week following surgical procedures, and were conducted
on the same day of each week for 8 consecutive weeks plus one chronic time point (week 28).
All animals were number-coded and researchers were blinded. Behavior was graded on a range
from 0 to 2, as previously described [37]. Briefly, a grade of 0 indicates no response. A grade of
1 was assigned for a withdrawal of the left hind limb. A grade of 2 was assigned for prolonged
left hind limb extension (more than 1 second), shaking or licking of the left hind limb, or a
vocalization (S1 Video). The reported ‘response score’ represents the sum of the individual
graded responses observed during RF EMF or thermal stimulation.
RF EMF stimulation
Animals were individually placed into a clear acrylic box with a RF antenna (915 MHz, Andrew
RFID-900-SC) fixed approximately 10 in. (25.4 cm) above, with ample clearance for air
exchange. The antenna was attenuated to deliver a time-averaged maximum power density of
756 ± 8.5 mW/m2, as measured by a 3-axis RF field-strength meter (TM-196, Tenmars, Tai-
wan). This power density was selected based on maximum field-strength measurements con-
ducted near an active cell-phone tower in our area (S1 Fig). In conjunction, we measured the
external electric field to be 21.5 ± 0.1 V/m, which corresponds to a SAR of 0.36 W/kg at the
skin surface. While this does not consider the contribution of induced electric fields inside the
tissue, this SAR is approximately 4 times less than currently advised maximum permissible
exposure (1.6 W/kg, spatial peak) for general populations [38]. RF EMF behavioral response
assays consisted of three experimental intervals: 2 minutes of baseline (antenna off), 10 minutes
of RF stimulation (antenna on), and 10 minutes of recovery (antenna off). RF EMF power den-
sity during ‘antenna off’ intervals was measured to be approximately 350 μW/m2. The total

 ‘behavioral response score’ was taken as the sum of each behavioral response over the RF EMF
stimulation period.
In order to determine whether a transient temperature rise might occur during RF EMF
stimulation, laser-thermometer skin temperature measurements were taken from 10 randomly
selected animals prior to undergoing surgical procedures. During the ‘antenna on’ interval, a
mean skin temperature increase of 2.1 ± 0.7°C was observed, which returned to near-baseline
levels during the recovery interval (Fig 2C). Additionally, core body temperature measure-
ments (N = 4) indicated no significant temperature difference (-0.3 ± 0.1°C) during RF EMF
exposure, illustrating that RF EMF-induced temperature increase is both transient and
localized.
Thermal stimulation
In order to characterize the pain response evoked by direct thermal stimulation, a skin temper-
ature difference of approximately 5°C was induced by exposure to an infrared heating lamp.
Animals were individually placed into a clear acrylic box with a 125 W infrared lamp (Philips,
Korea) positioned 12 inches (30.5 cm) above the animal. Pain responses were evaluated during
three experimental intervals: 2 minutes of baseline (heat lamp off), 5 minutes of thermal stimu-
lation (heat lamp on), and 5 minutes of recovery (heat lamp off). The thermal stimulation
duration was selected in order to achieve a mean skin temperature rese of approximately 5°C
from baseline, and was determined by laser-thermometer measurements conducted on 10 ran-
domly selected animals prior to TNT surgeries.
Lidocaine block of nerve conduction
Lidocaine control assays were conducted one day following ‘Week 4’ behavioral response
assays. Each animal was lightly anesthetized using 2% isofluorane and received a subdermal
injection of 100 μL 2% Lidocaine at the neuroma site. Approximately 10 minutes after recover-
ing from anesthesia, each animal was subjected to behavioral response assays, as described
above.
Dorsal root ganglion culture and calcium imaging
All in vitro calcium imaging experiments were performed on dissociated embryonic (E 16–18)
dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. Whole embryonic mouse DRGs were purchased from
BrainBits, Inc. (BrainBits, USA) and were enzymatically dissociated by incubation with 1 mg/
ml collagenase (Invitrogen, USA) at 37°C for 60 min. DRGs were then transferred to 0.125%
Trypsin (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and incubated at 37°C for 15 min. Trypsinization was quenched
by adding 10% fetal bovine serum in Hank’s Buffered Salt Solution (Sigma Aldrich, USA) and
further mechanical dissociation was carried out by 30x gentle trituration using a sterile glass
fire-polished Pasteur pipette. The dissociated tissue was collected by centrifugation at 200 g for
3 min. DRG neurons were then re-suspended in NbActiv4 (BrainBits, USA) plus 25 ng/ml
nerve growth factor (NGF, Sigma Aldrich, USA) and transferred onto glass-bottomed 35 mm
culture dishes (In Vitro Scientific, USA), which had previously been coated with 0.1 mg/ml
Poly-D-lysine (Sigma Aldrich, USA). Dissociated DRG cultures received 50% medium
exchange (NbActiv4 plus 25 ng/ml NGF) every 3 days, and were housed continuously at 37°C
and 5% CO2 prior to imaging. For visualization of intracellular calcium concentrations, disso-
ciated DRGs were incubated for 15 minutes at 37°C with 5 μM Fluo-3 AM (an established cell-
permeant Ca2+ indicator) in 250 μL NbActiv4. Cells were washed once with NbActiv4 and the
medium was replaced before imaging. All fluorescence calcium imaging experiments were per-
formed on a Nikon A1R confocal microscope system (Nikon, Inc.). Throughout the

 experiments, cells were housed in an environmentally controlled stage-top incubator (Tokai
HIT) at 37°C and with 5% CO2. The RF antenna was fixed approximately 6 inches above the
stage-top incubator. RF EMF dosage (756 ± 8.5 mW/m2 at 915 MHz) and exposure schedule (2
minute baseline, 10 minute RF exposure, and 10 minute recovery) were identical to those used
in behavioral response assays.
Within each culture dish, a field of view was selected which included 20–60 individually dis-
tinguishable fluorescent DRG neurons. Fluo-3 fluorescence was excited by a 488 nm laser
diode, and the cells were imaged at 1 Hz across all experimental intervals. Individual sensory
neuron cell bodies were outlined and defined as regions of interest (ROIs) within Nikon’s ND
Elements software (Nikon, USA). Mean pixel intensity values were measured for all time-series
data sets and ΔF/F values were calculated by establishing and subtracting a time-dependent
fluorescence baseline for each cell, as previously described [39]. Peak detection was carried out
in Matlab software, with the calcium spike threshold criteria set to ΔF/F � 0.15 (unless other-
wise indicated). Quantitative analysis of calcium spike frequency was carried out in novel
Python script and statistical analysis was carried out in OriginPro 9.0 software (Origin Soft-
ware, USA).
Calcium imaging in the presence of TNF-α
In order to evaluate the potential synergistic effects of inflammatory cytokines and RF EMFs
on dissociated DRG neurons, calcium imaging experiments were conducted in the acute and
incubated presence of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α, N = 95). Acute synergistic calcium
imaging experiments consisted of four experimental intervals: 2 minutes of baseline (antenna
off), 1 minute of cytokine perfusion (to a final concentration of 10 ng/ml), 10 minutes of RF
stimulation (antenna on), and 10 minutes of recovery (antenna off). Incubated synergistic cal-
cium imaging experiments were conducted following 50 hr incubation of DRG neurons in 10
ng/ml TNF-α and consisted of three experimental intervals: 2 minutes of baseline (antenna
off), 10 minutes of RF stimulation (antenna on), and 10 minutes of recovery (antenna off).
