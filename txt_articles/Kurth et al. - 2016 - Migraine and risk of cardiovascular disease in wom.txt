ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To evaluate the association between migraine and 
incident cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular 
mortality in women.
Design
Prospective cohort study among Nurses’ Health Study 
II participants, with follow-up from 1989 and through 
June 2011.
setting
Cohort of female nurses in United States.
PartiCiPants
115 541 women aged 25-42 years at baseline and free of 
angina and cardiovascular disease. Cumulative 
follow-up rates were more than 90%.
Main OutCOMe Measures
The primary outcome of the study was major 
cardiovascular disease, a combined endpoint of 
myocardial infarction, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular 
disease. Secondary outcome measures included 
individual endpoints of myocardial infarction, stroke, 
angina/coronary revascularization procedures, and 
cardiovascular mortality.
results
17 531 (15.2%) women reported a physician’s diagnosis 
of migraine. Over 20 years of follow-up, 1329 major 
cardiovascular disease events occurred and 223 
women died from cardiovascular disease. After 
adjustment for potential confounding factors, migraine 
was associated with an increased risk for major 
cardiovascular disease (hazard ratio 1.50, 95% 
confidence interval 1.33 to 1.69), myocardial infarction 
(1.39, 1.18 to 1.64), stroke (1.62, 1.37 to 1.92), and 
angina/coronary revascularization procedures (1.73, 
1.29 to 2.32), compared with women without migraine. 
Furthermore, migraine was associated with a 
significantly increased risk for cardiovascular disease 
mortality (hazard ratio 1.37, 1.02 to 1.83). Associations 
were similar across subgroups of women, including by 
age (<50/≥50), smoking status (current/past/never), 
hypertension (yes/no), postmenopausal hormone 
therapy (current/not current), and oral contraceptive 
use (current/not current).
COnClusiOns
Results of this large, prospective cohort study in 
women with more than 20 years of follow-up indicate a 
consistent link between migraine and cardiovascular 
disease events, including cardiovascular mortality. 
Women with migraine should be evaluated for their 
vascular risk. Future targeted research is warranted to 
identify preventive strategies to reduce the risk of 
future cardiovascular disease among patients with 
migraine.
Introduction
Migraine is a primary headache disorder that affects 
approximately one fifth of the general US population for 
at least part of their lives, and women are affected three 
to four times more often than men.1-3  Migraine, specifi-
cally migraine with aura, has been consistently associ-
ated with increased risk of stroke, including both 
ischemic and hemorrhagic subtypes.4 5  Although the 
pathophysiology of migraine has close links to the vas-
cular system, the mechanisms by which migraine 
increases risk of stroke remain unclear.6 7  Potential 
mechanisms for an association between migraine and 
stroke include endovascular dysfunction,8 
9  increased 
thrombogenic susceptibility,10  increased prevalence of 
vascular risk factors,11  shared genetic markers,12 
13  corti-
cal spreading depolarization,14 
15  and inflammation.16 
17
As most of these mechanisms also increase the risk of 
other cardiovascular disease events, migraine may be 
viewed as a marker of increased risk for any vascular 
disease event. However, as the one year prevalence of 
migraine peaks in midlife whereas the incidence of car-
diovascular events increases exponentially with age, 
links between migraine and any cardiovascular disease 
are not easily identifiable. Long follow-up, particularly 
of younger populations, is needed to study this associa-
tion. Few prospective studies have reported an associa-
tion between migraine and any cardiovascular disease 
events,18-21  including ischemic heart disease and car-
diovascular death.18 
20 
21
Because of the high prevalence of migraine, any 
association between migraine and cardiovascular dis-
ease would have a substantial effect on public health. 
We thus aimed to evaluate the association of migraine 
with total and specific cardiovascular disease events as 
well as cardiovascular disease specific mortality in the 
Nurses’ Health Study II, one of the largest prospective 
cohort studies on health in younger women, aged 25 to 
42 at baseline.

Methods
study population
Established in 1989, the Nurses’ Health Study II is an 
ongoing prospective cohort study of 116 430 female reg-
istered nurses in the United States who were 25-42 years 
old at baseline. Information on reproductive factors, 
lifestyle factors, and medical history was collected 
through a self administered questionnaire at baseline 
and has been updated every two years through 
 
follow-up questionnaires. The cumulative response rate 
based on person time is more than 90%. For the pur-
pose of this analysis, we included follow-up from base-
line through June 2011. We excluded 889 women who 
reported cardiovascular disease at baseline (angina, a 
coronary revascularization procedure, myocardial 
infarction, or stroke) from our analyses, leaving 115 541 
women free of angina or any symptomatic cardiovascu-
lar disease for our analyses.
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. Results of the 
study will be disseminated to patients’ organizations 
and via the webpage of the Nurses’ Health Study 
 
(http://www.nurseshealthstudy.org).
assessment of migraine
On the baseline (1989) and two follow-up question-
naires (1993 and 1995), women were asked to indicate 
whether a physician had diagnosed them as having 
migraine. Person time status for having a migraine 
started whenever migraine was first reported. Agree-
ment between self reported migraine and 2004 Interna-
tional Headache Society criteria was high in another 
comparable cohort of female health professionals.22 
Information on migraine aura, migraine frequency, or 
migraine specific drugs was not available.
ascertainment of cardiovascular disease events
Every two years, women reported any incident cardio-
vascular disease event on the follow-up questionnaires 
and then completed a supplemental questionnaire con-
firming the event. Self reported information on cardio-
vascular disease was confirmed through review of 
medical record or supporting information by a physi-
cian who was blinded to the exposure status and the 
specific research question under study. Deaths were 
identified by reports from next of kin, from postal 
authorities, or by searching the National Death Index. 
At least 98% of deaths among the Nurses’ Health Study 
II participants were identified using these approaches.23 
Causes of death were confirmed by review of autopsy 
reports, medical records, and death certificates.
The occurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction 
was confirmed if symptoms met World Health Organiza-
tion criteria, which require typical symptoms plus 
either diagnostic electrocardiographic findings or ele-
vated cardiac enzyme concentrations.24 If medical 
records were unavailable, we considered myocardial 
infarctions probable when additional confirmatory 
information was provided by the participant. Informa-
tion on angina and coronary revascularization proce-
dures (percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty 
or coronary artery bypass grafting surgery) was self 
reported, and we included only events that occurred 
before a manifest cardiovascular disease event.
A non-fatal stroke diagnosis was confirmed, accord-
ing to National Survey of Stroke criteria, if the partici-
pant had a new focal neurologic deficit with sudden or 
rapid onset that persisted for more than 24 hours.25 We 
excluded cerebrovascular pathology due to infection, 
trauma, or malignancy, as well as “silent” strokes dis-
covered only by radiologic imaging. Radiology reports 
of brain imaging (computed tomography or magnetic 
resonance imaging) were available in 89% of those with 
medical records. We classified strokes as ischemic 
stroke (thrombotic or embolic occlusion of a cerebral 
artery), hemorrhagic stroke (subarachnoid and intrapa-
renchymal hemorrhage), or stroke of probable/
unknown subtype (a stroke was documented but the 
subtype could not be ascertained owing to medical 
records being unobtainable).
Fatal cardiovascular disease was defined as fatal coro-
nary heart disease, fatal stroke, or fatal cardiovascular 
disease. Fatal coronary heart disease was defined as 
ICD-9 (international classification of diseases, ninth revi-
sion) codes 410-412 and was considered confirmed if fatal 
coronary heart disease was confirmed via medical records 
or autopsy reports or if coronary heart disease was listed 
as the cause of death on the death certificate and there 
was prior evidence of coronary heart disease in the medi-
cal records. We designated as probable those cases in 
which coronary heart disease was the underlying cause 
on the death certificates but no prior knowledge of coro-
nary heart disease was indicated and medical records 
concerning the death were unavailable. Similarly, we 
used ICD-9 codes 430-434 to define fatal stroke and fol-
lowed the same procedures to classify cases of confirmed 
or probable fatal stroke. Lastly, fatal cardiovascular dis-
ease was defined by ICD-9 codes 390-458.
Our primary outcome measure was major cardiovas-
cular disease, a combined endpoint of myocardial 
infarction, stroke, or fatal cardiovascular disease (fatal 
stroke, fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal coronary 
heart disease). We chose this composite outcome as it 
has been used as outcome in previous studies,18 
26  and it 
follows guidelines on prevention of all cardiovascular 
disease to capture the full impact of risk factors and car-
diovascular health.27 We further assessed the following 
secondary outcome measures: total myocardial infarc-
tion, which was defined as fatal or non-fatal myocardial 
infarction; total stroke, which included all fatal and 
non-fatal stroke cases (ischemic, hemorrhagic, and 
undetermined subtypes); angina/coronary revascular-
ization procedure; and cardiovascular disease mortality.

cardiovascular disease, date of death, or end of fol-
low-up (June 2011), whichever occurred first. We used 
Cox proportional hazards models with age and two year 
follow-up cycle as timescale to evaluate the association 
between migraine and the various outcomes. We calcu-
lated age adjusted and multivariable adjusted hazard 
ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals. The 
multivariable adjusted models controlled for age (con-
tinuous), elevated cholesterol (yes/no), diabetes (yes/
no), hypertension (yes/no), body mass index (<25, 
25-<30, ≥30), smoking status (never, past, current), 
alcohol consumption (0, 0-14.9, ≥15 g/day), physical 
activity (metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs) in fifths) 
(continuous), postmenopausal hormone use (never, 
past, current), menopausal status (premenopausal, 
postmenopausal, dubious), ever used oral contraceptive 
(never, past, current), aspirin use (<2 days/week, 
≥2 days/week), acetaminophen (paracetamol) use 
(<2 days/week, ≥2 days/week), non-steroidal anti- 
inflammatory drug use (<2 days/week, ≥2 days/week), 
and family history of myocardial infarction before the 
age of 60 (yes/no). We adjusted for all the covariates in 
the models in a time varying fashion on the basis of 
 
information available on each of the biennial question-
naires (1991 to 2009).
We evaluated effect modification by age (<50/≥50), 
smoking status (current/past/never), hypertension 
(yes/no), postmenopausal hormone therapy (current/
not current), and oral contraceptive use (current/not 
current). We tested effect modification by including an 
interaction term for migraine and the potential effect 
modifier in the outcome models.
We tested the proportional hazards assumption by 
including an interaction term for migraine status and 
the logarithm of follow-up time for the primary out-
comes in age adjusted models. We found no statistically 
significant violation. In sensitivity analyses, we 
repeated the analyses on the basis of migraine informa-
tion provided at baseline only.
We had 3.1% missing information on all covariates 
and used a missing variable indicator to account for this 
lack of information in our multivariable models. In sen-
sitivity analyses, we used multiple imputation (proc mi) 
to account for missing information and also ran a model 
excluding all missing information.
We used SAS 9.3 for all analyses. All P values were 
two sided, and we considered a P value of less than 0.05 
to be statistically significant.
Results
Of the 115 541 women in this study, 17 531 (15.2%) 
reported a physician’s diagnosis of migraine at baseline 
in 1989. An additional 6389 women newly reported a 
physician’s diagnosis on subsequent questionnaires 
and were classified having migraine during follow-up. 
Women with migraine were more likely to have an unfa-
vorable cardiovascular risk factor profile, including 
hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, family history of 
myocardial infarction, body mass index of 30 or above, 
and current smoking status. They were also more likely 
to use aspirin, acetaminophen, and non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs (table 1).
Table 2 summarizes the associations between 
migraine and various cardiovascular outcomes. During 
follow-up, 1329 major cardiovascular disease events 
(678 total myocardial infarctions, 651 total strokes, and 
203 angina/coronary revascularization procedures) 
occurred. A total of 223 deaths due to cardiovascular 
disease occurred. Compared with women without 
migraine, those with a self reported physician’s diagno-
sis of migraine had a multivariable adjusted hazard 
ratio of 1.50 (95% confidence interval 1.33 to 1.69) for 
developing major cardiovascular disease. Findings 
were significant for all evaluated individual outcomes, 
and the highest estimates were seen for stroke (hazard 
ratio 1.62, 1.37 to 1.92) and angina/coronary revasculari-
zations (1.73, 1.29 to 2.32).

The associations between migraine and cardiovascu-
lar disease outcomes (major cardiovascular disease, total 
myocardial infarction, and total stroke) were not modi-
fied by age (<50/≥50) (P for interaction all ≥0.34), current 
postmenopausal hormone use (P for interaction all 
≥0.57), current oral contraceptive use (P for interaction 
all ≥0.84), current smoking status (P for interaction all 
≥0.26), or hypertension (P for interaction all ≥0.37). In 
sensitivity analyses, we restricted analysis to women 
with a report of migraine at baseline. The multivariable 
adjusted hazard ratios were 1.57 (1.38 to 1.77) for major 
cardiovascular disease, 1.77 (1.49 to 2.11) for total stroke, 
and 1.39 (1.17 to 1.66) for total myocardial infarction. The 
results of the association between migraine and major 
cardiovascular disease were very similar when we used 
multiple imputation (hazard ratio 1.50, 1.33 to 1.71) or 
when we excluded missing information (1.53, 1.35 to 1.74).
discussion
In this large, prospective cohort study of female nurses 
aged 25 to 42 at inclusion who were free of cardiovascu-
lar disease at the start of follow-up and with more than 
20 years of follow-up, we found consistent associations 
between migraine and cardiovascular disease events. 
We found an approximately 50% increased risk for 
major cardiovascular disease. This association per-
sisted after adjustment for traditional vascular risk fac-
tor and was apparent for myocardial infarction, stroke, 
and coronary artery procedures as well as for angina. 
We also found an increased risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease mortality.
Comparison with other studies
Most studies evaluating the association between 
migraine and vascular events have been limited to 
 
ischemic stroke.4 28  Some studies have reported an 
association between migraine and cardiovascular dis-
ease.18-21  Results of our study are in line with findings 
from the Women’s Health Study,18 another large pro-
spective cohort study among female health profession-
als aged 45 or older at inclusion. In the Women’s Health 
Study, migraine was associated with an increased risk of 
major cardiovascular disease events (hazard ratio 1.42, 
95% confidence interval 1.16 to 1.074), including cardio-
vascular disease mortality (1.63, 1.07 to 2.50). In the 
Women’s Health Study, the increased risk was apparent 
only for women who reported migraine with aura. In our 
study, information on aura was not available.
In a matched cohort study of 11 541 patients with 
migraine who were aged 18 to 45 years and an equal 
number of controls from the Taiwan National Health 
Insurance database, Wang and colleagues reported an 
increased risk of ischemic heart disease for people with 
migraine (hazard ratio 2.50, 1.78 to 3.52).20  The Reykja-
vik Study, which included 18 725 men and women, 
showed very similar results for the association between 
overall migraine and cardiovascular disease mortality.21 
 
After adjustment for potential confounders, partici-
pants with any indication of migraine had a 16% 
increased risk of dying from any cause (hazard ratio 
1.16, 1.04 to 1.29). This risk was stronger for people with 
migraine with aura (hazard ratio 1.21, 1.12 to 1.30) and 
was higher for mortality from cardiovascular disease 
(1.27
, 1.13 to 1.43) compared with people without head-
ache. Results from the American Migraine Prevalence 
and Prevention study also indicate an increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease events. In this population based 
case-control study of 6102 patients with migraine and 
5243 controls, migraine overall was associated with a 
relative risk for myocardial infarction of 2.16 (1.70 to 
2.76) and for total stroke of 1.54 (1.16 to 2.05).19
Two studies have found an association between 
migraine with aura and angina but not myocardial 
infarction.29 
30 The lack of association with myocardial 
infarction may be related to shorter follow-up time. In 
our data, women with migraine had an increased risk 
for myocardial infarction, as well as for angina and cor-
onary revascularization procedures.
Many studies have focused on the evaluation of 
potential modifying factors and on the identification of 
a subgroup of patients with migraine who are at high 
risk for developing a subsequent stroke. Studies have 
consistently found that the association between 
migraine and stroke was observable only among 
younger people and was stronger among women.28 
 
Among women, several studies have focused on the role 
of smoking and oral contraceptive use.28 
31 
32  In particu-
lar, the combination of smoking and oral contraceptive 
use among young women with migraine with aura 
markedly increased the risk of ischemic stroke, reach-
ing a 10-fold increase for current cigarette smokers and 
oral contraceptives users.33  However, for overall 
 
vascular risk status, several studies indicate that the 
association between migraine and ischemic stroke is 
apparent only among those with a low cardiovascular 
risk profile.33

Studies on modifying effects of other cardiovascular 
disease events are sparse. Findings of the Women’s 
Health Study indicate that migraine with aura and an 
increased vascular risk profile resulted in a higher risk 
of incident myocardial infarction.34 However, the event 
rate among women with migraine with aura was still 
too small to robustly evaluate the role of individual vas-
cular risk factors, including postmenopausal hormone 
use.
Potential biological mechanisms
Several mechanisms that have been implied for 
migraine have also been linked with increased risk of 
cardiovascular disease, such as increased thrombo-
genic susceptibility,10  shared genetic markers,12 
13  and 
inflammation processes.16 17  Our findings confirm 
results of other studies that women with migraine have 
a higher prevalence of vascular risk factors, such as 
hypertension, higher body mass index, and hypercho-
lesterolemia.11 
19  However, as all studies evaluating the 
association between migraine and cardiovascular dis-
ease have controlled for these factors, the association 
between migraine and cardiovascular disease is 
unlikely to be explained by this. Evidence suggests that 
the pathophysiology of migraine can also be viewed in 
part as a systemic disorder affecting the endovascular 
system.9 
35-39
strengths and limitations of study
Our study has several strengths, including the prospec-
tive design, large number of participants and outcome 
events, long follow-up, high participation rate, stan-
dardized evaluation of migraine and cardiovascular 
disease risk factors, confirmation of outcomes by physi-
cian’s review, and the homogeneous nature of the 
cohort (all were nurses), which may reduce confound-
ing by factors such as access to medical care.
Several limitations should be considered when inter-
preting our results. Firstly, physician diagnosed 
migraine status was self reported, leading to potential 
misclassification. In addition, people with mild 
migraines may not have reported symptoms to a clini-
cian and thus not received a diagnosis. Because of the 
prospective design, however, such misclassification 
would probably result in underestimation of relative 
risks and would be unlikely to explain the observed 
association pattern. Furthermore, a previous report in a 
comparable study of female health professionals 
showed that self reported migraine had good agreement 
with the second edition of the International Classifica-
tion of Headache Disorders,22  and our prevalence of 
migraine is close to that reported in other population 
based studies.18 40 41  Secondly, we had no information 
on the presence or absence of migraine aura, and 
migraine with aura has been suggested to be the sub-
group carrying most of the risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease.4 18  Furthermore, no information on frequency of 
migraine or migraine specific information was avail-
able. Thirdly, residual confounding—for example, by 
markers of inflammation or genetic factors10 12 13—
remains a potential alternative explanation, as our data 
are observational. Finally, participants in this study 
were all nurses aged 25 to 42 at baseline and mostly 
white, so generalizability to other populations might be 
limited. However, we have no reason to believe that that 
the biological mechanisms by which migraine might be 
associated with vascular events and mortality would be 
different in other populations of women.
implications of findings
The results of our study support the findings of other 
population based studies linking migraine with 
increased risk of cardiovascular disease.18-20  Although 
most studies link migraine with aura with increased 
risk of ischemic stroke,4 
28 emerging evidence indicates 
that this risk extends to other cardiovascular disease as 
well. Our data support consideration of a history of 
migraine as a marker for increased risk of any cardio-
vascular disease event.
To date, no clear mechanisms have been identified 
that could explain the increased risk of cardiovascular 
disease and mortality among patients with migraine, 
and no data exist on whether prevention of migraine 
attacks reduces these risks. Data from the National 
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey and results of 
a randomized clinical trial provide initial evidence that 
the combination of a statin and vitamin D may reduce 
the burden of migraine,42 
43 which may be explained by 
the anti-inflammatory effects of these drugs. Future tar-
geted research, such as on whether statins and vitamin 
D reduce the burden of migraine and cardiovascular 
disease, is urgently warranted to provide answers to 
patients and their treating physicians.
Conclusions
Results of this large, prospective cohort study among 
women support the hypothesis that migraine is a 
marker for increased risk of any cardiovascular events. 
Given the high prevalence of migraine in the general 
population, an urgent need exists to understand the 
biological processes involved and to provide preventive 
solutions for patients.
