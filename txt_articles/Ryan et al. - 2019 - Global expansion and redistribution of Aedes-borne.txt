Abstract
Forecasting the impacts of climate change on Aedes-borne viruses—especially dengue,
chikungunya, and Zika—is a key component of public health preparedness. We apply an
empirically parameterized model of viral transmission by the vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae.
albopictus, as a function of temperature, to predict cumulative monthly global transmission
risk in current climates, and compare them with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on
general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track opti-
mal temperature ranges for transmission (21.3–34.0˚C for Ae. aegypti; 19.9–29.4˚C for Ae.
albopictus), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the
differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate
change. More severe climate change scenarios produce larger population exposures to
transmission by Ae. aegypti, but not by Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Climate-
driven risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will increase substantially, even in the
short term, for most of Europe. In contrast, significant reductions in climate suitability are
expected for Ae. albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the
next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to virus transmission
by both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario. As major net losses in year-round transmis-
sion risk are predicted for Ae. albopictus, we project a global shift towards more seasonal
risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral
evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to
increased net and new exposures to Aedes-borne viruses, the most extreme increases in
Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change
scenarios.

 Author summary
The established scientific consensus indicates that climate change will severely exacerbate
the risk and burden of Aedes-transmitted viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, Zika,
and other significant threats to global health security. Here, we show more subtle impacts
of climate change on transmission, caused primarily by differences between the more
heat-tolerant Aedes aegypti and the more heat-limited Ae. albopictus. Within the next cen-
tury, nearly a billion people could face their first exposure to viral transmission from
either mosquito in the worst-case scenario, mainly in Europe and high-elevation tropical
and subtropical regions. However, while year-round transmission potential from Ae.
aegypti is likely to expand (particularly in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa), Ae. albopic-
tus transmission potential is likely to decline substantially in the tropics, marking a global
shift towards seasonal risk as the tropics eventually become too hot for transmission by
Ae. albopictus. Complete mitigation of climate change to a pre-industrial baseline may
protect almost a billion people from arbovirus range expansions; however, middle-of-the-
road mitigation could produce the greatest expansion in the potential for viral transmis-
sion by Ae. albopictus. In any scenario, mitigating climate change would shift the pro-
jected burden of both dengue and chikungunya (and potentially other Aedes transmitted
viruses) from higher-income regions back onto the tropics, where transmission might
otherwise begin to decline due to rising temperatures.
Introduction
Climate change will have a profound effect on the global distribution and burden of infectious
diseases [1–3]. Current knowledge suggests that the range of mosquito-borne diseases could
expand dramatically in response to climate change [4,5]. However, the physiological and epi-
demiological relationships between mosquito vectors and the environment are complex and
often nonlinear, and experimental work has shown a corresponding nonlinear relationship
between warming temperatures and disease transmission [6–8]. In addition, pathogens can be
vectored by related species, which may be sympatric, or several pathogens may be transmitted
by the same vector. Accurately forecasting the potential impacts of climate change on Aedes-
borne viruses—which include widespread threats like dengue and yellow fever, as well as sev-
eral emerging threats like chikungunya, Zika, West Nile, and Japanese encephalitis—thus
becomes a key problem for public health preparedness [4,9,10]. In this paper, we compare the
impact of climate change on transmission by two vectors, Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus.
The intensification and expansion of vector-borne disease is likely to be a significant threat
posed by climate change to human health [2,11]. Mosquito vectors are of special concern due
to the global morbidity and mortality from diseases like malaria and dengue fever, as well as
the prominent public health crises caused by several recently-emergent viral diseases like West
Nile, chikungunya, and Zika. The relationship between climate change and mosquito-borne
disease is perhaps best studied, in both experimental and modeling work, for malaria and its
associated Anopheles vectors. While climate change could exacerbate the burden of malaria at
local scales, more recent evidence challenges the “warmer-sicker world” expectation [12,13].
The optimal temperature for malaria transmission has recently been demonstrated to be much
lower than previously expected [14], likely leading to net decreases and geographic shifts in
optimal habitat at continental scales in the coming decades [13].
Relative to malaria, less is known about the net impact of climate change on Aedes-borne
diseases and their vectors. Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus have both (re)emerged and spread

 worldwide throughout tropical, sub-tropical, and temperate zones in urban areas. Ae. aegypti
is restricted to warm, urban environments where it breeds in human-made containers in and
around houses. Further, it bites during the daytime exclusively on humans, and is a highly
competent vector for dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and other viruses. In contrast,
while Ae. albopictus can adopt this urban ecology, it is far more ecologically flexible, and
occurs in suburban, rural, residential, and agricultural habitats and breeds in both natural or
human-made containers. It bites humans and a wide range of mammals and birds, and is a
moderately competent vector for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika.
In a changing climate, differences in the thermal tolerances of the two mosquitoes are likely
to have broad repercussions for their role in future outbreaks. Ae. albopictus has become estab-
lished across a broad latitudinal gradient, with temperate populations undergoing diapause to
survive cold winters, while populations in warmer locations have lost the ability to diapause
[15]. Aligning with the warmer microclimates of urban environments, Ae. aegypti is estimated
to have a higher thermal optimum for transmission than Ae. albopictus (29˚C vs. 26˚C) [6].
Given the climate limitations on vector distributions, at a minimum Aedes mosquitoes are pro-
jected to shift geographically and seasonally in the face of climate change, with a mix of expan-
sions in some regions and contractions in others, and no overwhelming net global pattern of
gains or losses [3,9]. Ecophysiological differences between Aedes vector species are likely to
drive differences in thermal niches, and therefore different distributions of transmission risk
[6,16], now and in the future. The consequences of those range shifts for disease burden are
therefore likely to be important but challenging to summarize across landscapes and
pathogens.
Dengue has reemerged since the 1980s and is now one of the most common vector-borne
diseases worldwide, following the end of decades of successful control of the Ae. aegypti vector
[17,18]. Of all Aedes-borne diseases, dengue fever has been most frequently modeled in the
context of climate change, and several models of the potential future of dengue have been pub-
lished over the last two decades, with some limited work building consensus among them [4].
Models relating temperature to dengue vectorial capacity (the number of new infectious mos-
quito bites generated by one human case), and applying general circulation models (GCMs) to
predict the impacts of climate change, date back to the late 1990s [5]. A study from 2002 esti-
mated that the population at risk (PAR) from dengue would rise from 1.5 billion in 1990 to
5–6 billion by 2085 as a result of climate change [19]. A more recent study added GDP per cap-
ita as a predictor in dengue distribution models, and found that climate change would increase
the global dengue PAR by a much more moderate 0.28 billion by 2050 with GDP held constant
compared to today [20]. Accounting for expected changes in global economic development
using linked GDP-climate pathways further reduced the projected PAR by 0.12 billion over
the same interval [20]. Mechanistic models have shown that increases or decreases in dengue
risk can be predicted for several sites on the same continent based on climate model and sce-
nario selection [21]. Most recently, a recent study prepared for the IPCC 1.5˚ report showed
that limiting climate change to 1.5˚ could prevent 3.3 million dengue cases per year in the
Americas compared to no intervention (+3.7˚C) [22].
Chikungunya and Zika viruses, which have emerged more recently as public health crises,
are less well-studied in the context of climate change. Like dengue, these viruses are transmit-
ted primarily by Ae. aegypti in the tropics and sub-tropics and by Ae. albopictus in temperate
zones and other settings where Ae. aegypti are absent [23–27]. While dengue, chikungunya,
and Zika viruses all have sylvatic cycles involving forest mosquitoes and non-human primates,
recent global outbreaks have been dominated by urban transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae.
albopictus. Because these viruses are transmitted by the same vectors, and vector physiology
dominates much of the transmission process, most early models of climate-dependent

 chikungunya and Zika transmission assumed that these viruses would exhibit similar thermal
responses to dengue [6,28]. However, several virus-specific transmission models have been
developed recently. A monthly model for chikungunya in Europe, constrained by the presence
of Ae. albopictus, found that the A1B and B1 scenarios (older climate change scenarios, roughly
comparable to intermediate scenarios RCP 6.0 and 4.5 in current climate assessments) both
correspond to substantial increases in chikungunya risk surrounding the Mediterranean [29].
An ecological niche modeling study conducted early in the Zika epidemic found that dengue is
likely to expand far more significantly due to climate change than Zika [10] (but epidemiologi-
cal differences among these three viruses remain unresolved [30–32]). While the combined
role of climate change and El Niño has been posited as a possible driver of the Zika pandemic’s
severity [10], there is little evidence that anomalous climate conditions were a necessary pre-
cursor for Zika transmission. The climate suitability of the region was present and adequate
for outbreaks of dengue and chikungunya, transmitted by the same mosquitoes, making the
introduction of another arbovirus plausible. In contrast to statistical models, global mechanis-
tic forecasts accounting for climate change are scarce for both chikungunya and Zika, given
how recently both emerged as public health crises, and how much critical information is still
lacking in the basic biology and epidemiology of both pathogens.
In this study, we apply a new mechanistic model of the spatiotemporal distribution of
Aedes-borne viral outbreaks to resolve the role climate change could play in the geographic
shifts of diseases like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. Whereas other mechanistic approaches
often rely on methods like dynamic energy budgets to build complex biophysical models for
Aedes mosquitoes [33,34], and subsequently (sometimes) extrapolate potential epidemiological
dynamics [5], our approach uses a single basic cutoff for the thermal interval where viral trans-
mission is possible. The simplicity and transparency of the method masks a sophisticated
underlying model that links the basic reproduction number, R0, for Aedes-borne viruses to
temperature, via experimentally-determined physiological response curves for traits like biting
rate, fecundity, mosquito lifespan, extrinsic incubation rate, and transmission probability [6].
The models examine the relative sensitivity of R0 to temperature, conditioned on the presence
of the mosquito vector and independent of other factors that might influence transmission,
including precipitation, vector control, and prior immune history. The temperature-depen-
dent R0 model is easily projected into geographic space by defining model-based measures of
suitability and classifying each location in space as suitable or not. We parameterize the model
using a Bayesian approach to account for uncertainty in the experimental data. The threshold
condition in our model (R0(T) > 0) defines the temperatures at which transmission is not pre-
vented, rather than the more familiar threshold at which disease invasion is expected (R0(T) >
1, which cannot be predicted in the absence of assumptions about vector and human popula-
tion sizes and other factors). We then classify each location by suitability in each month based
on already published projections under current climate in the Americas [6].
Here, we extend previous work to investigate the impacts of climate change on Aedes-borne
virus transmission. Specifically, we expand the framework for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopic-
tus to project cumulative months of suitability in current and future (2050 and 2080) climates,
and further examine how global populations at risk might change in different climate change
scenarios. We explore variation among both climate model selection (general circulation mod-
els; GCMs), and potential emissions pathways described in the IPCC AR5 (representative con-
centration pathways; RCPs). In doing so, we provide the first mechanistic forecast for the
potential future transmission risk of chikungunya and Zika, which have been forecasted pri-
marily via phenomenological methods (like ecological niche modeling [10]). Our study is also
the first to address the seasonal aspects of population at risk for Aedes-borne diseases in a
changing climate.

 Methods
The temperature dependent R0 Model
Our study presents geographic projections of published, experimentally-derived mechanistic
models of viral transmission by Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus. The approach is to fit the ther-
mal responses of all the traits that are components of R0 in a Bayesian framework and then
combine them to obtain the posterior distribution of R0 as a function of these traits (described
in detail in Johnson et al. [7], and the particular traits and fits for Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus
are presented in Mordecai et al. [6]). The approach involves deriving an equation for R0 from a
modified version of the Ross-MacDonald model for mosquito-borne transmission:
R0 T
ð Þ ¼
a2 � b � c � e�
m
PDR � EFD � pEA � MDR
N � r � m3
�
�1=2
In this equation the parameters are defines as follows: a is biting rate (per mosquito); b � c is
vector competence; μ is mosquito mortality rate; PDR is parasite (here, viral) development
rate; EFD is eggs produced per female mosquito per day; MDR is the mosquito egg-to-adult
development rate; pEA is probability of mosquito survival from egg to adult; N is human popu-
lation size; and r is human recovery rate. All of these parameters, except for N and r, corre-
spond to vector or pathogen traits and are treated as functions of temperature T, with thermal
response curves fit to each parameter/trait independently. Because N and r are difficult to
obtain at large scales, R0 values are rescaled to range from zero to one, and areas where a nor-
malized R0 > 0 are considered thermally suitable for transmission because temperature does
not prevent transmission from occurring. The original study fit trait thermal response curves
for each temperature-dependent trait and mosquito species using laboratory experimental
data, often derived from single laboratory populations [6]. Further individual- and popula-
tion-level trait variation remains an empirical gap that is not addressed in the R0 model.
In the original modeling study [6], empirical data were compiled on transmission of dengue
virus by both mosquito species, and the models for Ae. aegypti were subsequently validated on
human case data compiled for three viruses (dengue, chikungunya, and Zika). The model per-
formed well describing the observed thermal range of transmission for all three viruses, and
indicated it was likely adequate for chikungunya and Zika in the absence of more tailored
information. Specifically, a statistical model based on the Ae. aegypti R0(T) model predicted
the probability of autochthonous transmission in country-scale weekly disease data across the
Americas with 86–91% out-of-sample accuracy for dengue and with 66–69% accuracy for chi-
kungunya and Zika, and predicted the magnitude of incidence given local transmission for all
three viruses with 85–86% accuracy [6]. A subsequent study using the same R0(T) approach
and updated Zika-specific thermal response data has found that the thermal optimum and
upper thermal limit for Zika transmission were the same as those of dengue but that the mini-
mum temperature for transmission was higher than that of dengue [35], indicating that the
model’s accuracy may vary slightly across viruses transmitted by the focal mosquitoes. Our
results are most applicable to dengue, and may offer an indication of possible future scenarios
for other viruses, which can be refined as more virus-specific data are collected. For many
emerging viruses of concern transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (like Mayaro or St. Louis
encephalitis viruses), the data necessary to parameterize temperature-dependent transmission
models may not be available for several years.
Once we obtained our posterior samples for scaled R0 as a function of temperature we eval-
uated the probability that R0 > 0 (Prob(R0 > 0)) at each temperature, giving a distinct curve
for each mosquito species. We then defined a cutoff of Prob(R0 > 0) = α to determine our

 posterior estimate of the probability that temperature is suitable for transmission; here, we use
α = 0.975. This very high probability allows us to isolate a temperature window for which
transmission is almost certainly not excluded; this is a conservative approach designed to mini-
mize Type I error (inclusion of areas not suitable, and prevent overestimation of potential
risk). For Ae. aegypti, these bounds are 21.3–34.0˚C, and for Ae. albopictus, 19.9–29.4˚C. The
prior study added an 8˚ daily temperature range and incorporated variation in transmission
traits within a single day to derive daily average R0 estimates, for the model validation compo-
nent [6]; in this study we used the main constant-temperature models derived in [6], as there
is both limited empirical laboratory data on the vector-pathogen response to fine-scale varia-
tion, and projecting daily thermal range responses so far in the future would add much more
uncertainty into our climate forecasts. Our maps of current risk therefore differ slightly from
those presented in Fig 4 in [6], but are otherwise produced using the same methodology.
Current and future climates
Current mean monthly temperature data was derived from the WorldClim dataset (www.
worldclim.org) [36]. For future climates, we selected four general circulation models (GCMs)
that are most commonly used by studies forecasting species distributional shifts, at a set of four
representative concentration pathways (RCPs) that account for different global responses to
mitigate climate change. These are the Beijing Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-
CSM1.1); the Hadley GCM (HadGEM2-AO and HadGEM2-ES); and the National Center for
Atmospheric Research’s Community Climate System Model (CCSM4). Each of these can
respectively be forecasted for RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0 and RCP 8.5. The scenarios are created
to represent standardized cases of how future climate will respond to emissions outputs, ranging
from the best-case scenario for mitigation and adaptation (2.6) to the worst-case, business-as-
usual fossil fuel emissions scenario (8.5). The scenarios are denoted by numbers (e.g. 2.6, 8.5)
corresponding to increased radiation in W/m2 by the year 2100, therefore expressing scenarios
of increasing severity in the longest term. However, scenarios are nonlinear over time; for exam-
ple, in 2050, RCP 4.5 is a more severe change than 6.0, as emissions peak mid-century in 4.5 fol-
lowed by drastic action, whereas emissions rise more slowly to a higher endpoint in 6.0.
Climate model output data for future scenarios were acquired from the research program
on Climate Change, Agriculture, and Food Security (CCAFS) web portal (http://ccafs-climate.
org/data_spatial_downscaling/), part of the Consultative Group for International Agricultural
Research (CGIAR). We used the model outputs created using the delta downscaling method,
from the IPCC AR5. For visualizations presented in the main paper, we used the Had-
GEM2-ES model, the most commonly used GCM. The mechanistic transmission model was
projected onto the climate data using the ‘raster’ package in R 3.1.1 (‘raster’ [37]). Subsequent
visualizations were generated in ArcMap.
Population at risk
To quantify a measure of population at risk, comparable between current and future climate
scenarios, we used population count data from the Gridded Population of the World, version
4 (GPW4)[38], predicted for the year 2015. We selected this particular population product as it
is minimally modeled a priori, ensuring that the distribution of population on the earth’s sur-
face has not been predicted by modeled covariates that would also influence our mechanistic
vector-borne disease model predictions. These data are derived from most recent census data,
globally, at the smallest administrative unit available, then interpolated to produce continuous
surface models for the globe for 5-year intervals from 2000–2020. These are then rendered as
globally gridded data at 30 arc-seconds; we aggregated these in R to match the climate scenario

 grids at 5 minute resolution (approximately 10 km2 at the equator). We used 2015 population
count as our proxy for the current population, and explored future risk relative to the current
population counts. This prevents arbitrary demographic model-imposed patterns emerging,
possibly obscuring climate-generated change. We note that these count data reflect the dispari-
ties in urban and rural patterns appropriately for this type of analysis, highlighting population-
dense parts of the globe. Increasing urbanization would likely amplify the patterns we see, as
populations increase overall; however, the lack of appropriate population projections at this
scale for 30–50 years in the future limits the precision of the forecasts we provide. We thus
opted for a most conservative approach. We finally subdivide global populations into geo-
graphic and socioeconomic regions as used by the Global Burden of Disease studies (S1 Fig)
[39]. We used the ‘fasterize’ R package [40] to convert these regions into rasters with percent
(out of 100) coverage at polygon edges. To calculate population at risk on a regional basis,
those partial-coverage rasters were multiplied by total population grids.
Results
The current predicted pattern of temperature suitability based on mean monthly temperatures
(Fig 1) reproduces the known or projected distributions of Aedes-borne viruses like dengue
[41], chikungunya[42], and Zika [10,43,44] well. For both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, most
of the tropics is currently optimal for viral transmission year-round, with suitability declining
along latitudinal gradients. Many temperate regions currently lacking major Aedes vectors, or
otherwise considered unsuitable by previous disease distribution models [10,41,44], are
mapped as thermally suitable for up to six months of the year by our model. In these regions
where vectors are present, limited outbreaks may only occur when cases are imported from
travelers (e.g. in northern Australia, where dengue is not presently endemic but outbreaks
occur in suitable regions[21]; or in mid-latitude regions of the United States, where it has been
suggested that traveler cases could result in limited autochthonous transmission[43,45]). In
total, our model predicts that 6.01 billion people currently live in areas suitable for Ae. aegypti
transmission at least part of the year (i.e., 1 month or more) and 6.33 billion in areas suitable
for Ae. albopictus transmission, with significant overlap between these two populations.
By 2050, warming temperatures are expected dramatically expand Aedes transmission risk
(Fig 2A and 2B). For Ae. aegypti, major expansions of one- or two-month transmission risk
occur in temperate regions, along with expanding suitability for year-round transmission in
the tropics, even into the high-elevation regions that were previously protected by cooler tem-
peratures. Ae. albopictus transmission risk similarly expands substantially into temperate
regions, especially high latitude parts of Eurasia and North America. However, because warm-
ing temperatures are projected to exceed the upper thermal limits to Ae. albopictus transmis-
sion in many places, major reductions are projected in regions of seasonal risk (e.g., in North
Africa) and year-round suitability (e.g., in northern Australia, the Amazon basin, central
Africa and southern Asia). Whereas the current gradient of high transmission in the tropics
and lower potential in temperate zones is preserved under future climates for Ae. aegypti,
warming becomes so severe in the tropics that year-round Ae. albopictus transmission risk pat-
terns qualitatively change, especially in the more extreme climate pathways. By 2080, year-
round temperature suitability for transmission by Ae. albopictus is mostly confined to high ele-
vation regions, southern Africa, and the Atlantic coast of Brazil, while the warmer-adapted Ae.
aegypti begins to lose some core area of year-round temperature suitability for transmission,
especially in the Amazon basin.
Concurrently with geographic expansions, our models predict a global net increase in pop-
ulation at risk from Aedes-borne virus exposure, closely tracking the global rise in mean

 temperatures (Fig 3). For both mosquito species, the number of people at risk of any months
of transmission suitability will experience a major net increase by 2050, on the order of half a
billion people; however, increases are greater for Ae. aegypti than for Ae. albopictus. In 2050,
more severe climate change scenarios consistently produce greater numbers of people at risk.
By 2080, the impact of rising temperature on transmission by each mosquito species diverges:
while more severe scenarios continue to drive up the number of people exposed to one or
more months of suitable climate for Ae. aegypti transmission—to nearly a billion more people
exposed than at present—the greatest numbers for Ae. albopictus transmission suitability are
instead found in intermediate climate change scenarios (RCP 4.5 and 6.0).
For year-round exposure, net changes also increasingly differ over time between the two
mosquito species. In 2050, warming temperatures lead to a net increase of roughly 100–200
million people in areas of year-round transmission potential for Ae. aegypti; in contrast, even
in the least severe climate change scenarios, there are drastic net losses of year-round transmis-
sion potential for Ae. albopictus, and these reductions are larger for more severe scenarios.
These patterns continue into 2080 for Ae. albopictus, with approximately 700 million fewer
people than at present at risk for transmission in the most extreme warming scenarios: in RCP
8.5 by 2080, some parts of the tropics become so warm that even the warmer-adapted Ae.
aegypti will no longer be able to transmit viruses.

 Examining the results by region (Tables 1 and 2), we find that the regional velocity of cli-
mate change is likely to determine the future landscape of Aedes transmission risk. For Ae.

 risk are in Europe, east Asia, high-elevation parts of central America and east Africa, and the
United States and Canada. But increases are expected across the board except in the Carib-
bean, where minor net losses are expected across scenarios and years. In contrast, for Ae. albo-
pictus, more region-specific changes are anticipated. Major increases in Europe are expected
for all climate scenarios and years, with smaller increases in Central America, east Africa, east
Asia, and the U.S. and Canada. However, major net decreases in Ae. albopictus transmission
potential are expected in several regions, including tropical Latin America, western Africa,
south Asia and most of southeast Asia, with a net reduction of nearly 125 million people at risk
by 2080 in RCP 8.5. Because the upper thermal limit for Ae. albopictus transmission is rela-
tively low (29.4˚C), the largest declines in transmission potential in western Africa and south-
east Asia are expected with the largest extent of warming, while less severe warming could
produce broader increases and more moderate declines in transmission potential. The differ-
ence between RCP 6.0 and 8.5 is on the order of 50 million fewer people at risk in west Africa
and 100 million fewer in Southeast Asia in the warmer scenario, highlighting just how signifi-
cant the degree of mitigation will be for regional health pathways.
For year-round transmission, the patterns are similarly variable across climate scenarios
and regions (S1 and S2 Tables). Overall, we predict a global shift towards more seasonal risk
for both mosquito species, especially in the warmest scenarios. For Ae. aegypti, some of the
largest net increases in people at risk are expected in southern Africa, with additional notable
increases expected in Latin America. Although the upper thermal limit for transmission by Ae.
aegypti is very high (34.0˚C), warming temperatures are projected to exceed the upper thermal
limit for parts of the year in some cases; for example, the moderate RCP 4.5 pathway leads to

 the largest increases in people at risk of temperature suitability for Ae. aegypti transmission in
southern Asia. Overall, almost 600 million people currently live in areas where temperatures
are expected to become suitable for Ae. aegypti transmission year-round, though the net
increase in year-round transmission will be much less (S1 Table). For Ae. albopictus, major
net reductions are expected in south and southeast Asia, totaling more than 400 million people
no longer at year-round risk with the most extreme warming, and additional reductions are
expected in east Africa and Latin America. Only the southern part of sub-Saharan Africa is
projected to experience net increases in year-round transmission risk (S2 Table).
Gross increases—in contrast to net changes—are expected in several regions, particularly in
east Africa, placing roughly 250 million people into areas of year-round transmission despite
nearly triple that number in net losses. We consider this idea of “first exposures” separately
(gross increases, not accounting for losses, in population at any transmission risk), because
this form of exposure may be particularly important epidemiologically, as it represents people
with little prior immune history with the focal pathogens. While viral immunology is complex
[46,47], previously unexposed people may have high susceptibility to chikungunya, Zika, and
primary dengue infection, although secondary dengue infections are often the most severe
[46]. We rank regions by the number of first exposures (Table 3), and we find that consistently
the largest number of first exposures driven by newly suitable climate are expected in Europe
and east Africa for both mosquito species. As the 2005 epidemic of chikungunya in India and
the 2015 pandemic of Zika virus in the Americas highlight, arboviral introductions into naïve
populations can produce atypically large outbreaks on the order of millions of infections. This
supports concern that both Europe and East Africa may, as a consequence of climate change,

 be increasingly at risk for explosive outbreaks of vector-borne disease where populations of
Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus have established [48,49].
Discussion
The dynamics of mosquito-borne illnesses are climate-driven, and current work suggests that
climate change will dramatically increase the potential for expansion and intensification of
Aedes-borne virus transmission within the next century. Modeling studies have anticipated cli-
mate-driven emergence of dengue and chikungunya at higher latitudes [50,51] and higher ele-
vations [52,53], and predicted the potential ongoing global expansion of Zika [10,44]. The
majority of research at global scales [10,21,54] and in North America and Europe [55] has sug-
gested that climate change is likely to increase the global burden of dengue and chikungunya,
and therefore, that mitigation is likely to benefit global health [22,56]. Aedes-borne virus
expansion into regions that lack previous exposure is particularly concerning, given the poten-
tial for explosive outbreaks when arboviruses are first introduced into naïve populations, like
chikungunya and Zika in the Americas [57]. The emergence of a Zika pandemic in the Old
World [58], the establishment of chikungunya in Europe beyond small outbreaks [29], or
introduction of dengue anywhere a particular serotype has not recently been found, is a critical
concern for global health preparedness. However, because effects of climate on vector-borne
disease transmission are nonlinear [6,14,35,59–62], climate change may increase transmission
potential in some settings and decrease it in others, yet the potential for climate-driven shifts
and decreases in disease burden is less well-understood (but see Ryan et al. [13]). Using geos-
patial projections of a mechanistic temperature-dependent transmission model, we investi-
gated geographic, seasonal, and population changes in risk of virus transmission by two
globally important vectors, Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus with climate warming by 2080.
Overall, our findings support the expectation that climate change will expand and increase
Aedes-borne viral transmission risk. However, we also find more nuanced patterns that differ
among the mosquito species, climate pathways, localities, and time horizons. The largest
increases in population at risk are consistently projected in Europe, with additional increases
in high altitude regions in the tropics (eastern Africa and the northern Andes) and in the
United States and Canada. These increases are expected not only for occasional exposure, but
also for longer seasons of transmission, especially by Ae. aegypti. However, in the tropics, for

sion risk; parentheticals give the net change (first exposures minus populations escaping transmission risk). All values

 both mosquito species, and in other regions for Ae. albopictus, more extreme climate pathways
are expected to increase temperatures beyond the suitable range for transmission in many
parts of the world. In addition to increases in total exposure from both mosquitoes in our
study, we predict a global shift towards seasonal regimes of exposure from Ae. albopictus. This
apparent paradox is due to the shifting geography of two slightly different sets of temperature
bounds, as they also move across varying densities of human populations.
As warming temperatures could exceed the upper thermal limits for transmission, esti-
mated at 29.4˚C for Ae. albopictus and 34.0˚C for Ae. aegypti, we predict, counterintuitively,
that partial climate change mitigation could cause greater increases in exposure risk, particu-
larly for transmission by Ae. albopictus, than no mitigation. However, partial mitigation is pre-
dicted to decrease the people, geographic areas, and length of seasons of risk for transmission
by Ae. aegypti, the primary vector of arboviruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Zika, in most
regions. Total mitigation (down to pre-industrial baselines) would presumably prevent this
redistribution of global risk more effectively. Given the current insufficient response to curb
carbon emissions and keep temperatures below the 2˚C warming target [63], models such as
those presented here can be useful as a means to anticipate possible future changes in climate
and temperature-driven transmission risk, depending on the degree of mitigation achieved.
These future predictions of global climate suitability for transmission risk are inherently
stochastic, and the degree to which our models will correspond to reality depends not only on
uncertainty about climate change, but also on uncertainty about the other environmental, bio-
logical, and social factors that drive disease [64]. For example, reductions in transmission may
be less prevalent than we expect here, if viruses and vectors evolve higher upper thermal limits
for transmission. Because mosquito survival is most limiting to transmission at high tempera-
tures for both mosquito species [6], increasing the thermal limits for transmission would
require mosquitoes to adapt to higher survival at warm temperatures, but selective pressure on
mosquitoes might instead promote faster development and reproductive cycles over short life-
spans. The extent to which mosquitoes and viruses can adapt to warming temperatures
remains a critical empirical gap, though there is limited evidence of a mosquito genotype by
chikungunya virus strain by temperature interaction in the laboratory, suggesting that popula-
tions may vary in transmission potential across temperatures [65]. Increases in transmission
risk are also complicated by other factors that drive transmission such as the presence or
absence of Aedes mosquitoes, which are also undergoing range shifts facilitated by both climate
change and human movement. Our model describes areas where Ae. albopictus and Ae. aegypti
are currently absent but could be present in the future, and may represent overestimates of
risk should Aedes ranges fail to expand into these areas. Whether expanding transmission risk
leads to future viral establishment and outbreaks depends not only on pathogen introduction,
but also on land use patterns and urbanization at regional scales, which mediate vector distri-
butions and vector–human contact rates [66,67].
In addition, the accuracy of the model predictions for different combinations of vector,
virus, and region depends on how vector and virus traits vary across populations and regions.
The data used to fit the mechanistic models are derived from dengue virus traits in mosquitoes
from multiple source populations from independently-published trait thermal response stud-
ies [6]. In addition, many of the traits are measured in laboratory strains and rearing condi-
tions, which may distort life-history relative to wild vector populations, although this will be
more problematic for pathogens with longer development times, such as malaria [68]. For Ae.
aegypti, the most commonly implicated vector of dengue, our results suggest a strong link
between warming temperatures and increased transmission [6,41]. The temperature-depen-
dent transmission models were also originally validated for chikungunya and Zika viruses in
the Americas and performed well, indicating coarse-scale predictability of climate-dependent

 patterns of transmission [35]. For chikungunya, the reductions in Ae. albopictus transmission
potential in south and southeast Asia are particularly notable because the vector is common in
that region, where it transmits the introduced Indian Ocean lineage (IOL) of chikungunya
(characterized by the E1-226V mutation, which increases transmission efficiency by Ae. albo-
pictus specifically [69,70]). In south and southeast Asia, these results might suggest a decreased
risk of chikungunya transmission in the most extreme climate scenarios, while arbovirus
transmission by Ae. aegypti could continue to increase. Further, multiple chikungunya intro-
ductions to Europe have been transmitted by Ae. albopictus and/or have carried the E1-226V
mutation, suggesting that Ae. albopictus expansion in Europe might correspond to increased
chikungunya risk [69,71,72]. In contrast, Ae. aegypti may be more relevant as a chikungunya
vector in the Americas, where it was implicated in the explosive 2015 outbreak [69].
In practice, these models are a first step towards an adequate understanding of potential
future changes in the distribution of disease burden, and the potential of these models to make
accurate predictions depends on a number of confounding factors [73,74]. In particular, the
link from transmission risk to clinical outcomes is confounded by other health impacts of
global change, including changing patterns of precipitation, socioeconomic development,
nutrition, healthcare access, land use, urbanization, vector and virus adaptation to temperature
and other pressures, and vector management, all of which covary strongly. Moreover, human
behavioral and societal adaptation to climate change may have just as much of an impact as
mitigation in determining how disease risk patterns shift; for example, increased drought
stress may encourage water storage practices that increase proximity to Aedes breeding habitat
[75]. Together concurrent global changes will determine the burden of Aedes-borne outbreaks,
modulating the predictions we present here.
Many models exist to address this pressing topic, each with different approaches to control
for data limitations, confounding processes, climate and disease model uncertainty, different
concepts of population at risk, and different preferences towards experimental, mechanistic,
or phenomenological approaches e.g. [4,8,10,16,24,33,34,41,44,45,53,61,67,67,76–78]. While
climate change poses perhaps the most serious threat to global health security, the relationship
between climate change and burdens of Aedes-borne diseases is unlikely to be straightforward,
and no single model will accurately predict the complex process of a global regime shift in
Aedes-borne viral transmission. Our models only set an outer spatiotemporal bound on where
transmission is thermally plausible, given climate projections. Climate change is likely to
change the relationship between transmission risk and disease burden at fine scales within
those zones of transmission nonlinearly, such that areas with shorter seasons of transmission
could still experience increased overall disease burdens, or vice versa. Combining broad spatial
models with finer-scale models of attack rates or outbreak size is a critical step towards bridg-
ing scales [58,79], but more broadly, building consensus and revealing similarities and differ-
ences between all available models via transparency, is of paramount importance [80]. This
task is not limited to research on dengue and chikungunya; with several emerging flaviviruses
on the horizon [81,82], and countless other emerging arboviruses likely to test the limits of
public health infrastructure in coming years [83], approaches that bridge the gap between
experimental biology and global forecasting can be one of the foundational methods of antici-
pating and preparing for the next emerging global health threat.

are averaged across GCMs, broken down by year (2050, 2080) and RCP (2.6, 4.5, 6.0, 8.5), and
are given as net change from current population at risk. 0+/0- denote the sign of smaller non-
zero values that rounded to 0.0, whereas “0” denotes true zeros. (Losses do not indicate loss of
any transmission, only to reduction 11 or fewer months).
(DOCX)
S3 Table. Top 10 regional increases in populations experiencing year-round temperature
suitability for transmission (12 months). Regions are ranked based on millions of people
exposed for the first time to any transmission risk; parentheticals give the net change (first
exposures minus populations escaping transmission risk). All values are given for the worst-
case scenario (RCP 8.5) in the longest term (2080).
