IMPORTANCE Although concussion treatment guidelines advocate rest in the immediate
postinjury period until symptoms resolve, no clear evidence has determined that avoiding
physical activity expedites recovery.
OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between participation in physical activity within 7
days postinjury and incidence of persistent postconcussive symptoms (PPCS).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective, multicenter cohort study (August 2013-June
2015) of 3063 children and adolescents aged 5.00-17.99 years with acute concussion from 9
Pediatric Emergency Research Canada network emergency departments (EDs).
EXPOSURES Early physical activity participation within 7 days postinjury.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Physical activity participation and postconcussive symptom
severity were rated using standardized questionnaires in the ED and at days 7 and 28 postinjury.
PPCS (�3 new or worsening symptoms on the Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory) was
assessed at 28 days postenrollment. Early physical activity and PPCS relationships were
examined by unadjusted analysis, 1:1 propensity score matching, and inverse probability of
treatment weighting (IPTW). Sensitivity analyses examined patients (�3 symptoms) at day 7.
RESULTS Among 2413 participants who completed the primary outcome and exposure,
(mean [SD] age, 11.77 [3.35] years; 1205 [39.3%] females), PPCS at 28 days occurred in 733
(30.4%); 1677 (69.5%) participated in early physical activity including light aerobic exercise
(n = 795 [32.9%]), sport-specific exercise (n = 214 [8.9%]), noncontact drills (n = 143
[5.9%]), full-contact practice (n = 106 [4.4%]), or full competition (n = 419 [17.4%]), whereas
736 (30.5%) had no physical activity. On unadjusted analysis, early physical activity
participants had lower risk of PPCS than those with no physical activity (24.6% vs 43.5%;
Absolute risk difference [ARD], 18.9% [95% CI,14.7%-23.0%]). Early physical activity was
associated with lower PPCS risk on propensity score matching (n = 1108 [28.7% for early
physical activity vs 40.1% for no physical activity]; ARD, 11.4% [95% CI, 5.8%-16.9%]) and on
inverse probability of treatment weighting analysis (n = 2099; relative risk [RR], 0.74 [95%
CI, 0.65-0.84]; ARD, 9.7% [95% CI, 5.7%-13.7%]). Among only patients symptomatic at day 7
(n = 803) compared with those who reported no physical activity (n = 584; PPCS, 52.9%),
PPCS rates were lower for participants of light aerobic activity (n = 494 [46.4%]; ARD, 6.5%
[95% CI, 5.7%-12.5%]), moderate activity (n = 176 [38.6%]; ARD, 14.3% [95% CI,
5.9%-22.2%]), and full-contact activity (n = 133 [36.1%]; ARD, 16.8% [95% CI, 7.5%-25.5%]).
No significant group difference was observed on propensity-matched analysis of this
subgroup (n = 776 [47.2% vs 51.5%]; ARD, 4.4% [95% CI, −2.6% to 11.3%]).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among participants aged 5 to 18 years with acute concussion,
physical activity within 7 days of acute injury compared with no physical activity was
associated with reduced risk of PPCS at 28 days. A well-designed randomized clinical trial is
needed to determine the benefits of early physical activity following concussion.

R
est has long been considered the cornerstone of con-
cussion management,1 and pediatric guidelines uni-
versally recommend an initial period of cognitive and
physical rest following a concussion.1,2 Cognitive rest recom-
mendations include modification of school attendance and
mental activities.1 Physical rest recommendations advocate
avoidance of physical activity until postconcussive symp-
toms have resolved, endorsing gradual resumption of activi-
ties only if symptoms are not exacerbated.1,2
Due to limited high-quality evidence, existing physical
rest guidelines are based on consensus and precautionary
principles.2,3 There is limited evidence that following these
guidelines results in a positive effect on prognosis.4,5 Al-
though strenuous exercise in patients recovering from con-
cussion may be deleterious and increase re-injury risk,6 re-
cent literature suggests that protracted rest may hamper
concussion recovery,7 leading to secondary symptoms of fa-
tigue,depression,anxiety,andphysiologicaldeconditioning.3,8
Increasing evidence suggests the introduction of controlled,
light aerobic physical activity following pediatric concussion
may be safe9 while promoting recovery9 by enhancing physi-
cal, psychological, and academic outcomes.6,9,10 These
preliminary findings indicate that gradual resumption of
pre-injury activities could begin as soon as tolerated pro-
vided there is no increased risk of re-injury.11
The objective of this study was to examine the associa-
tion between participation in physical activity within 7 days
postinjury and the occurrence of persistent postconcussive
symptoms (PPCS) following concussion in children and ado-
lescents. It was hypothesized that early participation in physi-
cal activity would be associated with lower PPCS rates com-
pared with no physical activity.
Methods
This research comprises a planned secondary analysis of the
PredictingPersistentPostconcussiveProblemsinPediatrics(5P)
study,12,13 a prospective, multicenter cohort study that re-
cruited participants from August 2013 until June 2015 at 9
Pediatric Emergency Research Canada (PERC) network ter-
tiary pediatric emergency departments (EDs).
Participants
This study enrolled 3063 participants aged 5.00 to 17.99
years with ED presentation for acute head injury12,13 occur-
ring within the preceding 48 hours, who met concussion
diagnosis criteria according to the 2012 Zurich consensus
statement.1 Exclusion criteria were a Glasgow Coma Scale
score of 13 or less; any abnormality on brain computed
tomography or magnetic resonance imaging; neurosurgical
intervention, intubation, or intensive care unit admission;
multisystem injury requiring hospitalization; severe preexist-
ing neurological developmental delay resulting in com-
munication difficulties; intoxication; absence of trauma as
the primary event; previously enrolled in this same study;
insurmountable language barrier; or inability to follow-up by
phone or electronic-mail. The 5P study was approved by
ethics committees of each participating institution, and a
written informed consent and assent was obtained from all
participants or parents as appropriate.
Study Protocol
Trained research assistants completed standardized assess-
ments of all patients in the ED.12 Data were collected and
managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap)
tools hosted at the Children’
s Hospital of Eastern Ontario
Research Institute.14 Patients and parents provided informa-
tion on demographics and past history (ie, prior concussion,
headache, developmental or psychiatric conditions), as well
as injury characteristics using the Acute Concussion Evalua-
tion inventory,15 a validated scale used to identify concussion
in children and adolescents aged 3 to 18 years. Patients and
parents quantified pre-injury and current symptoms (ie,
physical, emotional, cognitive, and sleep) using the Post-
Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI).16 Cognitive status,
physical examination, and balance assessments were com-
pleted using the Child-Sport Concussion Assessment Tool-
3rd Edition (Child-SCAT3) evaluation.1,17
Follow-up Procedures
Enrolled patients were offered web-based survey or tele-
phone follow-up at 7 and 28 days postenrollment.12 Patients
received email reminders 24 hours after each survey dead-
line; research assistants telephoned nonresponders as many
as 5 times and offered verbal interviews. Surveys were parent
reported for children aged 5.00 to 7.99 years and patient re-
ported for all other participants. Current level of physical ac-
tivity was self-categorized as no activity (eg, physical rest),
light aerobic exercise (eg, walking, swimming, or stationary
cycling), sport-specific exercise (eg, running drills in soccer or
skatingdrillsinicehockey),noncontacttrainingdrills(eg,com-
plex passing drills), full-contact practice (eg, normal training
activities), and return to competition (eg, normal game play).12
Early physical activity participation was defined as any level
of physical activity other than no activity at 7 days postenroll-
ment. Early physical activity subcategories were defined as
no activity, light aerobic exercise, moderate exercise (sport-
specific exercise or noncontact training drills), or full exer-
cise (full-contact practice or return to competition). Ques-
tions regarding physical activity were based on Zurich
Key Points
Question Is participation in physical activity within 7 days
following acute concussion associated with lower rates of
persistent postconcussive symptoms in children and adolescents
compared with conservative rest?
Findings In this prospective, multicenter cohort study of 3063
children and adolescents aged 5.00 to 17.99 years after propensity
matching, the proportion with postconcussive symptoms at 28
days was 28.7% with participation in early physical activity vs
40.1% with conservative rest, a significant difference.
Meaning Participation in physical activity within 1 week after
injury may benefit symptom recovery following acute concussion
in children and adolescents.

steps; these questions have not been validated.
Primary Outcome Measure
Primary outcome was the presence of PPCS, defined as at
least 3 new or worsening individual symptoms compared
with the preconcussion status measured at day 28 according
to the validated PCSI.12,13,18 An individual symptom was
defined as a positive difference between the current minus
the perceived pre-injury symptom rating as completed 28
days postenrollment.12,13
Statistical Analysis
Frequencies and descriptive statistics were used to summa-
rize patient baseline characteristics for the overall sample and
by early physical activity. Missing data were managed via list-
wise deletion (ie, participants were excluded from the analy-
sis if any single values were missing).
TheproportionofPPCSineachgroupwascomputed,along
with a Wilson score 95% CI, a method for obtaining a CI for a
proportion.19 The unadjusted association between early physi-
cal activity and PPCS was estimated using the sample relative
risk (RR) and the sample Absolute risk difference (ARD).
Propensity scores20 were developed to account for poten-
tial confounding by observed baseline characteristics.21,22
A propensity score was derived to reflect the probability of a
participant having engaged in early physical activity given an
observed set of baseline characteristics. Propensity score
methods replace an entire set of baseline characteristics with
a single composite score, and this can be accomplished with
numbers of potential confounders in excess of what is pos-
sible with conventional regression methods.23-25 Clinically rel-
evant variables (defined a priori) and those that may be asso-
ciatedwithearlyphysicalactivitywereincludedinthemodels.
Continuous variables were categorized based on the Youden
index26 or through visualization using locally weighted poly-
nomial regression (LOESS) curves. The following variables
were included as predictors of early activity using multivari-
ate logistic regression to calculate the propensity score: age
group, sex, duration of prior concussion (no prior concussion
or concussion with symptoms lasting <1 week vs prior con-
cussion with symptoms lasting ≥1 week), personal history of
migraines, family history of migraines, learning disability,
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, developmental dis-
order, anxiety, depression, sleep disorder, other psychiatric
disorder, loss of consciousness duration (did not lose con-
sciousness or loss of consciousness <3 minutes vs loss of
consciousness ≥3 minutes), time between head injury and tri-
age, seizure, early symptoms on the Acute Concussion Evalu-
ation(appearsdazedandconfused,confusedaboutevents,an-
swers questions slowly, repeats questions, forgetful), balance
tandem stance (0-3 errors vs ≥4 errors or physically unable),
sports injury, all 20 parent reported indicators of the Postcon-
cussion Symptom Inventory,16 and site.
To examine the outcome associated with early activity,21
participants who did and did not engage in early physical ac-
tivity were matched 1:1 in random order on the logit of the pro-
pensity scores using a greedy algorithm and nearest-
neighbor approach (maximum caliper distance, 0.1) using the
MatchIt package in R (R Project for Statistical Computing).27
Equivalence between matched participants (activity vs non-
activity groups) was assessed by testing for differences in co-
variates using χ2 analyses and Mann-Whitney U tests where
appropriate. Standardized mean differences were calculated
using the R package Tableone. After obtaining a matched data
set, the association between early participation in physical ac-
tivity and PPCS was estimated using the sample RR and the
sample ARD.
Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was
used to investigate the association of early participation in
physical activity among the entire population of youth recov-
ering from acute concussion when this population is hypo-
thetically moved from no early activity to participation in
early activity. Participants were weighted by the inverse of
the probability of engaging in physical activity at day 7. The
association between early participation in physical activity
and PPCS was estimated using the RR obtained from log-
binomial regression and the ARD obtained from identity link
binomial regression. In both cases, the IPTW weights were
used with a quasibinomial model to obtain robust variance
estimates. To avoid convergence issues, the R package glm2
was used. Group differences were assessed by calculating
IPTW proportions, weighted medians, and standardized
mean differences.
Because the self-report questionnaire at day 7 does not
differentiate between the timing of activity and symptoms
withinthefirstweekpostinjury,2sensitivityanalyseswereper-
formed. First, the original analyses were repeated by replac-
ing the total ED symptom load with the total score at day 7.
Second, a subanalysis of only patients remaining sympto-
matic with at least 3 symptoms at day 7 was performed, thus
excluding recovered patients and those with minimal symp-
tomatology. A sensitivity analysis was also conducted to in-
vestigate a possible interaction between age and physical ac-
tivity in the model for PPCS. A quasibinomial model with a log
link included an effect for early exercise, age (as a continuous
variable), and the product of these 2 variables. Two sided
P values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant.AllanalyseswereperformedusingIBMSPSSStatisticsver-
sion 23 (IBM Corp) and R version 3.0.2.
Results
In total, 2584 of 3063 (84.4%) patients completed the pri-
mary outcome assessment (Figure 1). Of these, 171 were
excluded because of missing data on participation in physical
activity at day 7, resulting in a cohort of 2413 patients. Base-
line characteristics for the total cohort, and for participant
groups with and without early physical activity are summa-
rized in Table 1. Overall, 733/2413 (30.4%) patients met crite-
ria for PPCS.
Early Participation in Physical Activity
At 7 days postenrollment, 1677 (69.5%) patients reported par-
ticipating in physical activity including light aerobic exercise

(795 [32.9%]), sport-specific exercise (214 [8.9%]), noncon-
tact training drills (143 [5.9%]), full contact practice (106
[4.4%]), or return to competition (419 [17.4%]), and 736
patients (30.5%) reported no physical activity. Of the 1677
patients who engaged in early physical activity, 523 (31.3%)
were symptom free and 803 (48.0%) had at least 3 persistent
or worsening postconcussive symptoms at day 7. Of those
reporting engaging in no physical activity at day 7, 584
(79.5%) had at least 3 persistent or worsening postconcussive
symptoms at day 7.
Bivariable Analysis
In bivariable analysis (unweighted sample), early participa-
tion in any type of physical activity compared with no physi-
cal activity was associated with lower risk of PPCS (413 [24.6%]
patients vs 320 [43.5%] patients; RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.70-
0.80]; ARD, 18.9% [95% CI, 14.7%-23.0%]). When early physi-
cal activity subcategories were distinguished, participation in
light aerobic exercise (250 patients [31.4%]; RR, 0.82 [95% CI,
0.76-0.89]; ARD, 12.0% [95% CI, 7.2%-16.8%]), moderate ex-
ercise (87 patients [24.4%]; RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.69-0.81]; ARD,
19.1% [95% CI, 13.2%-24.6%]), and full exercise (76 patients
[14.5%]; RR, 0.66 [95% CI, 0.61-0.71]; ARD, 29.0% [95% CI,
24.2%-33.5%]) were all associated with significantly lower risk
of PPCS as compared with the no activity group (320 patients
[43.5%]; Table 2).
Propensity Score-Matched Analysis
Prior to matching, median propensity to engage in physical ac-
tivity in the activity group was 0.74 (interquartile range [IQR],
0.65-0.80) vs 0.66 (IQR, 0.55-0.75) in the nonactivity group.
Matching resulted in 554 children and adolescents participat-
ing in early physical activity matched to 554 children not par-
ticipating in activity. Because more participants reported en-
gaging in physical activity than not, 900 who participanted in
physical activity were unmatched in contrast to 91 nonactiv-
ity participants. The distribution of propensity scores in the
early activity and nonactivity groups are shown in before
matching (Figure 2A) and after matching (Figure 2B). Follow-
ing propensity score matching, mean (SD) propensity for early
physical activity was similar for those reporting activity (0.641
[0.176]) vs no physical activity (0.627 [0.171]) and also re-
sulted in between-group balance on baseline characteristics
(Table 1). In propensity score–matched bivariable analysis
(n = 1108),earlyparticipationinphysicalactivityremainedsig-
nificantly associated with lower PPCS risk (n = 159 [28.7%]) vs
n = 222[40.1%];RR,0.84[95%CI,0.77-0.92];ARD,11.4%[95%
CI, 5.8%-16.9%]).
Inverse Probability Treatment Weighting Analysis
IPTW, formed by those with complete data on exercise and all
43 covariates included in the propensity analysis, also re-
sulted in between-group balance on baseline characteristics
(Table 1; n = 2099). Figure 2C shows the weighted distribu-
tion of propensity scores in the early activity and nonactivity
groups. Mean (SD) weight was 2.00 (1.52) with a range of 1.03
to 12.9. The highest values for standardized mean differences
in the weighted data were 0.113 for wearing a mouth guard and
0.101forwearingahelmet;allotherbaselinevariableshadstan-
dardized mean difference values of less than 0.1. PPCS re-

Sensitivity Analyses
When the total ED symptom score was replaced with the total
score at day 7, only the association in the unweighted sample
remained significant with similar magnitude and directional-
ityasintheprimaryanalyses(bivariableanalysesRR,0.75[95%
CI, 0.70-0.80]; Table 3).
Inthesecondsensitivityanalysis,theanalyticalsamplewas
limited to children and adolescents with at least 3 symptoms
at day 7 (n = 1387). Despite current guidelines strongly advo-
cating physical rest until the patient is asymptomatic, 584 of
1387 (57.9%) participants engaged in some form of physical ac-
tivity (ie, were nonadherent with current recommenda-
tions). Although the directionality of the association re-
mained similar, the propensity score–matched analysis and
IPTW analysis no longer reached statistical significance
(bivariable analysis RR, 0.83 [95% CI, 0.74-0.92]); propensity
score–matched RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.80-1.05]; IPTW RR, 0.92
[95% CI, 0.82-1.04]; Table 3). When early physical activity sub-
categories were distinguished within this symptomatic co-
hort, children and adolescents who participated in physical ac-
tivity had lower risk of PPCS (light aerobic exercise absolute
risk, 46.4% [RR, 0.88 {95% CI, 0.78-0.99}; ARD, 6.6% {95% CI,
0.6%-12.5%}];moderateexerciseabsoluterisk,38.6%[RR,0.77
{95% CI, 0.66-0.89}; ARD, 14.3% {95% CI, 5.9%-22.2%}]; and
full exercise absolute risk, 36.1% [RR, 0.74 {95% CI, 0.63-
0.86}; ARD, 16.8% {95% CI, 7.5%-25.5%}]) compared with the
no activity group (absolute risk, 52.9%). Finally, there was no
statistically significant interaction between age and physical
activity in an unadjusted model for PPCS; for each additional
year of age, RR increased by a factor of 1.01 (95% CI, 0.97-
1.05; P = .52).
Discussion
In this prospective cohort study, 69.5% of children and ado-
lescents participated in physical activity within 7 days fol-
lowing an acute concussion—primarily with light aerobic
exercise. The resumption of physical activity within 7 days
postconcussion was associated with a lower risk of PPCS as
compared with no physical activity. This finding was consis-
tent across analytic approaches and intensity of exercise.
Evidenceabouttheimportanceofphysicalactivityinchild-
hood for maintaining physical and cognitive health is un-
equivocal.29Physicalactivityisconsideredaneffectivemethod
for improving cognitive function and brain health.30 Com-
pared with other conditions in which the latest insights regard-
ing the benefits of early physical rehabilitation have been ad-
opted, including stroke,31 the field of pediatric concussion
lags behind.2 Overwhelming evidence supports the overall
benefits of physical activity in youth 32 including better body
composition,33 skeletal health,34 and cardiorespiratory fitness,
as well as improvement of depression, anxiety, self-concept,35
cognitive performance, and academic achievement.36,37

Available evidence suggests that gradual resumption of physi-

cents, pilot evidence suggests that gradual resumption of aero-
bicphysicalactivitiesresultsinsuperiorsymptomrecoveryfrom
concussion compared with complete rest.9,10
A proposed mechanism by which exercise may improve
recovery is through the promotion of neuroplasticity mecha-
nisms and from possible effects on cardioregulatory mecha-
nisms, possibly leading to improved cerebral blood flow.39
This is of particular importance in pediatric concussion, since
autoregulatory dysfunction and abnormal cerebral blood flow
regulation have been associated with PPCS in school-aged
children.40,41 Controlled aerobic exercise may improve recov-
ery by restoring normal cerebral blood flow regulation10 with
the rate of symptom improvement relating directly to the ex-
erciseintensityachieved.10Conversely,physicalinactivitymay
predispose patients to PPCS through an activity restriction cas-
cade model; it has been theorized that the psychological con-
sequences of removal from life-validating activities, com-
bined with physical deconditioning, may contribute to the
developmentofPPCSaftermildtraumaticbraininjuryinyouth.3
The results of this study should be considered in the con-
text of study limitations. Because of the observational design,
the authors cannot account for unmeasured confounding due
to factors that may have been associated with physical activity
shortly after concussion, nor can causation be determined. Al-
though potential confounding by observed baseline character-
istics was accounted for by conducting a propensity analysis,20
unmeasured confounders and intermediaries may have influ-
enced the results. Because the lowest odds of PPCS were ob-
served in children participating in full exercise at day 7, chil-
dren who simply felt better may have started physical activity
earlier and subsequently resumed full competition despite still
having symptoms. This possibility was examined through sen-
sitivityanalysesinwhich1-weeksymptomsreplacedEDsymp-
toms and the inclusion of only those children with 3 or more
symptoms at day 7. Given the limitation of possible confound-
ing variables, a well-designed and adequately powered ran-
domized clinical trial is needed to confirm the benefits of early
return to physical activity.
Second, physical activity was rated via self-report ques-
tionnaires. Although direct measures of physical activity
have greater precision, no single criterion standard exists
and self-rated measures remain the most common and fea-
sible method of measuring physical activity in large settings
due to their practicality, low cost, low participant burden,
and general acceptance.42
Third, because objective data on physical activity (eg,
actigraphy) was not collected, information regarding dura-
tion and frequency of physical activity is limited; uncer-
tainty remains as to whether exercise intensity exacerbates
symptoms and how total activity load may be associated
with PPCS risk.
Fourth, it is possible that patients who did not resume
physical activity may have participated in more cognitive ac-
tivity and therefore may have been potentially more sympto-
matic. Measuring cognitive rest is challenging because it is
poorly defined across the literature and difficult to objec-
tively measure. Since objective cognitive activity data were not
collected, conclusions regarding the benefit or detriment of
cognitive rest were unattainable.
Fifth, because all participants received care as usual by
treating physicians, rest and activity recommendations likely
varied across sites and clinicians both in the ED and subse-
quent follow-up.
Sixth, the influence of interim activity (eg, participation
in physical activities between days 7 and 28 postenrollment)
was not considered.

Divergence from conservative rest recommendations fol-
lowing pediatric concussion toward early active physical
rehabilitation would be a new approach in concussion man-
agement, potentially affecting the well-being of millions of
children and families worldwide. Early physical activity
could mitigate the undesired effects of physical and mental
deconditioning associated with prolonged rest. Regardless of
potential benefit, caution in the immediate postinjury period
is prudent; participation in activities that might introduce
risk for collision (eg, resumption of contact sports) or falls
(eg, skiing, skating, bicycling) should remain prohibited until
clearance by a health professional to reduce the risk for a
potentially more serious second concussion during a period
of increased vulnerability. To be noted, results of this study
do not infer any evidence of benefit or harm in association
with return to practice or play.
Conclusions
Among children and adolescents aged 5 to 18 years with
acute concussion, participation in physical activity within 7
days of acute injury compared with no physical activity was
associated with lower risk of PPCS at 28 days. A well-
designed randomized clinical trial is needed to determine
the benefits of early physical activity following concussion.
