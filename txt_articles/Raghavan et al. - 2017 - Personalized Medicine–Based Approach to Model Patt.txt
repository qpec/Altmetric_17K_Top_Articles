Abstract
Purpose: Chemoresistant ovarian cancers grow in suspension
within the ascites fluid. To screen the effect of chemotherapeu-
tics and biologics on resistant ovarian cancers with a person-
alized basis, we developed a 3D hanging drop spheroid
platform.
Experimental Design: We initiated spheroids with primary
aldehyde dehydrogenase–positive (ALDHþ) CD133þ ovarian
cancer stem cells (OvCSC) from different patient samples and
demonstrated that stem cell progeny from harvested spheroids
was similar to the primary tumor. OvCSC spheroids were utilized
to initiate tumors in immunodeficient mice. Drug responses to
cisplatin and ALDH-targeting compound or JAK2 inhibitor deter-
mined whether the OvCSC population within the spheroids
could be targeted. Cells that escaped therapy were isolated and
used to initiate new spheroids and model tumor reemergence in a
personalized manner.
Results: OvCSC spheroids from different patients exhibited
varying and personalized responses to chemotherapeutics. Xeno-
grafts were established from OvCSC spheroids, even with a single
spheroid. Distinct responses to therapy were observed in distinct
primary tumor xenografts similar to those observed in spheroids.
Spheroids resistant to cisplatin/ALDH inhibitor therapy had
persistent, albeit lower ALDH expression and complete loss of
CD133 expression, whereas those resistant to cisplatin/JAK2
inhibitor therapy were enriched for ALDHþ cells.
Conclusions: Our 3D hanging drop suspension platform can
be used to propagate primary OvCSCs that represent individual
patient tumors effectively by differentiating in vitro and initiating
tumors in mice. Therefore, our platform can be used to study
cancer stem cell biology and model tumor reemergence to identify
new targeted therapeutics from an effective personalized medi-
cine standpoint. Clin Cancer Res; 23(22); 6934–45. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with
a projected 5-year mortality rate >70% (1). Cytoreductive surgery
and adjuvant chemotherapy can yield a clinical response even in
stage III–IV disease. Unfortunately, relapse and chemoresistance
are observed in a majority of patients (2). In the era of person-
alized medicine, and development of targeted therapeutics based
on patients' genetic status, it is important to develop in vitro
platforms that can reliably test and predict patient response to
novel therapeutics (3, 4).
Particular to ovarian cancer, malignant ascites is a therapeutic
challenge that is difficult to target even with the advent of
intraperitoneal
chemotherapy
(5–7).
Malignant
ascites
is
enriched in ovarian cancer stem-like cells (OvCSC) that can
contribute to therapeutic resistance (8–11). Previous studies have
indicated that the presence of CD133þ and aldehyde dehydro-
genase–positive (ALDHþ) cells in ovarian cancer patient samples
is a prognosis for reduced progression-free survival and poor
patient outcome (12–21). Moreover, the cancer stem cells (CSC)
were found to be present in the tumors after treatment with
carboplatin and paclitaxel, and these cells maintained their
tumor-initiating properties (22). When CSCs between matched
primary and recurrent ovarian tumor patient samples were com-
pared, CSCs were found at higher percentages after recurrence
(23). Therefore, clinical evidence supports the role of ovarian
CSCs in therapy response and tumor recurrence.
Currently, preclinical drug screening in vitro utilizes monolayer
adherent cultures that are convenient and economical to perform,
but do not recapitulate the nonadherent ascites environment. This
nonphysiologic screening approach often results in poor predic-
tive power for drug efficacy in patients (24). In vitro studies that
involve monolayer cultures of OvCSCs also result in a loss of the
CSC-like phenotype and a loss of physiologic relevance while

 studying their role in tumor biology (25–27). Studies that observe
and establish chemoresistance and invasive properties of OvCSCs
are traditionally performed on murine xenograft models, through
serially passaging to maintain and demonstrate tumorigenicity
(13, 16, 27, 28). Although these studies afford the opportunity to
investigate therapeutic resistance with a CSC context, murine
xenograft assays are often expensive and labor intensive to
perform.
Spheroids are highly valuable tools to recapitulate the ascites
microenvironment in vitro, and study both chemoresistance pat-
terns, as well as, tumorigenicity of OvCSCs. Particular to ovarian
cancer, spheroids also mimic the cellular aggregates often found
in suspension within malignant ascites, thereby serving as a highly
physiologically relevant in vitro model. 3D culture has also been
documented to maintain higher levels of cancer stem–like traits,
compared with monolayer cultures (20, 25, 26). We have previ-
ously demonstrated the use of a high-throughput easy-to-use 384-
well hanging drop array platform that can stably incorporate 10 to
100 ovarian cancer cells to form uniform size and shape spheroids
for analysis of drug response (29, 30). The ability to use small cell
numbers to initiate spheroids is highly relevant in the context of
OvCSCs, as they make up 0.1% to 0.5% of the cells found in
primary ovarian tumors (8). Given this limitation in source
material, platforms such as ours (29, 30), which can promote
homogenous replicates from a rare and scarce number of patient
cells to test their responses to various combinations of dose and
drug, are highly relevant and useful for therapeutic screening,
especially for personalized medicine applications.
In this study, we demonstrate the use of a spheroid-based
platform to generate spheroids from primary ovarian CSCs
derived from patient ascites (12). We further demonstrate the
predictive potency of spheroid-based therapeutic assays com-
pared with those conducted in vivo in murine xenograft models
established from OvCSC spheroids. We perform drug sensitivity
assays in the context of OvCSCs, by using the conventional
chemotherapeutic drug, cisplatin, and combining it with a novel
ALDH-targeting compound, in development, compound 673A
(31), as well as, a prominent JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib (32).
Platinum-based agents are the core chemotherapeutic for the
treatment of ovarian cancer (33, 34). In addition to cisplatin, we
chose two compounds, to study whether the OvCSC population
within spheroids could be targeted owing to their established
elevated ALDH activity (13), as well as, increased contribution of
the JAK2/STAT3 pathway in the maintenance of the CSC pool
(35, 36). Finally, by identifying populations that escape drug
treatment, we demonstrate the capability of this platform to
model the reemergence of tumors using therapy-escaping resis-
tant cells. The establishment of this model will allow for the study
of resistant cell populations and their biological contribution to
the emergence of therapeutic resistance in ovarian cancer, includ-
ing from a strong personalized medicine standpoint.
Materials and Methods
Materials
All tissue culture reagents and media supplements were pur-
chased from Life Technologies unless specified otherwise. Primary
ascites were collected from patients with informed signed consent
under an institutionally approved IRB protocol. Cisplatin was
purchased from Sigma Aldrich, and the ALDH inhibitor com-
pound 673A was a gift from R. Buckanovich's laboratory and
ruxolitinib was a gift from K. McLean's laboratory. The ALDE-
FLUOR Assay Kit was purchased from StemCell Technologies.
Isolation of OvCSCs from primary patient ascites
Cells were recovered from primary patient ascites following
protocols established previously (12). Briefly, primary patient
malignant ascites infusions were centrifuged to recover a cell
pellet, and red blood cells were lysed following manufacturer's
protocol of a commercial ACK lysis buffer (Life Technologies).
Cells were obtained from xenografted tumors using the Tumor
Cell Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) following the manufac-
turer's protocols. After a 40-mm filtration to obtain single-cell
suspensions, cells were recovered by centrifugation and resus-
pended in a flow cytometry appropriate buffer (FACS Buffer; PBS
supplemented with 2% FBS). OvCSCs were isolated on the
basis of concurrent elevated ALDH activity and expression of
CD133, following protocols established previously (12). Cells
were counted using a hemocytometer and adjusted to 1 � 106
cells/mL. The ALDEFLUOR Assay was carried out as per manu-
facturer's protocol, using diethylaminobenzaldehyde (DEAB) as a
negative control for ALDH staining. Simultaneously, cells were
incubated with activated ALDEFLUOR reagent or allophycocyanin
(APC)-conjugated CD133 antibody (Miltenyi Biotec) to isolate
CD133þ cells based on surface antigen expression and ALDHþ
cells on the basis on ALDH activity. A negative control for CD133-
APC staining was established using an isotype-matched APC-con-
jugated antibody, to identify background staining. Cells were
incubated in staining solutions for 30 to 45 minutes at 37�C,
washed with PBS, and resuspended in FACS buffer with 300
mmol/L 40,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI). Cells were sorted
on a flow cytometer, and discrete single-cell viable populations
were identified. Appropriate gates were set for ALDH and CD133-
APC using DEAB-stained tubes, and APC-isotype antibody tubes.
OvCSCs were isolated as the small fraction of cells positive for both
ALDH activity and the expression of CD133-APC (Supplementary
Fig. S1). For this study, OvCSCs were FACS sorted and obtained
from three different patient samples: Pt259 (stage IV progressive
primary peritoneal carcinoma), Pt224(stageIV, platinum-resistant,
Translational Relevance
Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy,
with nearly 70% relapse rate within 24 months. To improve
cure rates for ovarian cancers, we developed a patient-derived
3D platform to personalize the screening of chemotherapeu-
tics and biologics for resistant ovarian cancers. Our hanging
drop spheroid platform uses small numbers of patient-derived
ovarian cancer stem cells and allows for quick, high-through-
put, and inexpensive drug assays that produce comparable
results with xenograft models in shorter times. This work
demonstrates the utility of our platform in personalized drug
assays, which could be used to rapidly inform clinicians of
optimal treatment routes for each individual patient, thereby
potentially improving clinical outcomes and preventing sub-
optimal initial treatments. In addition, our platform can be
utilized in fundamental studies in cancer stem cell biology, as
well as, in modeling tumor reemergence, to identify new
targeted
therapeutics
from
a
personalized
medicine
standpoint.

 ovarian adenocarcinoma), and Pt152 (stage IIIc, recurrent plati-
num-resistant high-grade ovarian adenocarcinoma).
Hanging drop culture for spheroid formation from OvCSCs
FACS sorted OvCSCs were harvested and concentrated using
high-speed centrifugation. Cells were resuspended in serum-free
growth media (SFM; DMEM/F12 supplemented with 5 ng/mL
basic FGF, 5 ng/mL EGF, 1X B27 supplement, 1� insulin-trans-
ferrin-selenium supplement, 1� nonessential amino acids, and
1� antibiotics and antimycotics). Cell counts were obtained using
a hemocytometer and adjusted such that a 20 mL volume con-
tained 10 OvCSCs. Spheroids were initiated using 10 OvCSCs per
spheroid, following protocols established previously (29). Spher-
oids were maintained in SFM for a period of 7 days and imaged
using live phase-contrast microscopy to follow spheroid forma-
tion. Proliferation within spheroids was monitored using the
AlamarBlue assay, as established previously (29, 30). For spher-
oids initiated from cells isolated from xenografted tumors, spher-
oids were initiated using 50 cells per drop.
Flow cytometric analysis for OvCSC progeny within spheroids
At day 7, OvCSC spheroids were harvested and resuspended in
FACS buffer. Spheroids were mechanically dissociated into single-
cell suspensions and filtered through a 40-mm filter. Cell counts
were adjusted to a concentration of 100,000 cells/mL. Cells were
recovered via centrifugation and resuspended in ALDEFLUOR
buffer, provided within the ALDEFLUOR Assay Kit. ALDEFLUOR
assay was performed following the manufacturer's protocols,
using DEAB as an established negative control, and activated
ALDEFLUOR reagent for positive staining of ALDH activity.
Simultaneously, an isotype-matched APC antibody was used for
a negative control to identify positive CD133 expression with an
APC-conjugated CD133 antibody. Cells were divided into equal
volumes and concentrations across tubes, with at least 10,000
cells in each tube. Stained cells were incubated in the 37�C
incubator for 30 to 45 minutes, recovered by centrifugation, and
resuspended in FACS buffer with 300 mmol/L DAPI to assess
viability. Cells were processed through a flow cytometer, and
forward and side scatter were used to isolate single cells, that were
viable and DAPI negative. Gates were established using DEAB
(less than 0.2% false positive) and APC-isotype (less than 0.2%
false positive), and stained tubes were used to estimate the
percentage of cells that were: ALDHþ CD133�, ALDH� CD133þ,
ALDHþ CD133þ, and ALDH� CD133� (Supplementary Fig. S2).
At least 10,000 cells were counted for each flow analysis.
Drug treatment on OvCSC spheroids in hanging drop array
culture
OvCSC spheroids were initiated in 384-well hanging drop
arrays using 10 OvCSCs per spheroid. Spheroids were allowed
to aggregate and form a 3D microtissue over a period of 7 days, at
which point, flow cytometry–defined populations of OvCSC
progeny were established. For drug treatment, a 10� stock of
drug was prepared independently, and 2 mL of drug was added to
the 20 mL hanging drop containing spheroids to result in a final
concentration of 1�. Several drug-dosing regimens were carried
out, including cisplatin 50 mmol/L, the ALDH inhibitor com-
pound 673A 50 mmol/L, cisplatin 50 mmol/L þ 673A 50 mmol/L,
the JAK1/2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib 500 nmol/L, and/or cisplatin 50
mmol/L þ ruxolitinib 500 nmol/L. The concentrations for drug
dosing were arrived at following dose–response curves, where the
effect of the drug was maximal for the different patient samples,
while simultaneously demonstrating platinum resistance in
OvCSC spheroids. The effect of drug was assayed on spheroids
at 72 hours, using the AlamarBlue assay to determine viability
after drug treatment (Supplementary Fig. S3). Control untreated
spheroids were maintained for the same duration in culture. At
least 20 spheroids (technical replicates) were assayed per exper-
iment, with 3 to 5 biological replicates. Drug-treated spheroids
were imaged using phase-contrast microscopy to observe mor-
phologic differences in spheroids exposed to drug compared with
control untreated OvCSC spheroids. Flow cytometry was used to
analyze OvCSC progeny following 72-hour drug treatment to
identify whether chemotherapy targeted specific populations of
OvCSC progeny. Finally, spheroids were either treated with 500
nmol/L ruxolitinib or left untreated and collected and lysed in
RIPA buffer (Invitrogen) with complete proteinase inhibitor and
phosphatase inhibitor (Roche). Insoluble material was removed
by centrifugation. Protein concentrations were determined using
the Bradford Protein Assay Kit (Bio-Rad). Lysates were separated
by gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose mem-
brane. Primary antibodies for immunoblotting include anti–
phospho-STAT3 (tyrosine705, #9131, Cell Signaling Technolo-
gy), anti–total-STAT3 (#9139, Cell Signaling Technology), and
anti-GAPDH (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Following incubation
with the appropriate secondary antibody, bands were visualized
using the ECL Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Recovery of drug-treated spheroids to model tumor
reemergence and serial passaging
Following 72 hours of maximal dose drug treatment (cisplatin/
673A), OvCSC spheroids were harvested and suspended in FACS
buffer with 300 mmol/L DAPI. Cells were flow sorted based on
DAPI negativity, therefore isolating cells that remained viable
following drug treatment. Spheroids were reinitiated in hanging
drop array plates with cells suspended in SFM media and imaged
with phase-contrast microscopy to visualize spheroid formation.
To preliminarily model tumor reemergence in the most platinum-
sensitive (Pt259) and most platinum-resistant (Pt152) ascites
samples, spheroids were collected from these two patient samples,
mechanically dissociated to generate single-cell suspensions, and
re-counted to initiate 100 cells per drop spheroids for the next
passage. Spheroids were serially passaged for 7 cycles (P0–P6)
over a period of 7 weeks. Flow analysis was performed as outlined
previously at the end of each cycle to characterize OvCSC markers
(ALDH and CD133). This allowed us to identify OvCSC popula-
tions within serially passaged spheroids, while cells from the same
population were allowed to re-form spheroids, serving as a
preliminary model of tumor reemergence in vitro.
Tumor initiation and drug treatment from OvCSC spheroids in
NSG mice
OvCSC spheroids were generated from the Pt259 sample, using
10 cells per 20 mL drop. Spheroids were harvested at day 7,
recovered using centrifugation, and resuspended gently in 200
mL of 1:1 mixture of SFM and Matrigel, while maintaining spher-
oid integrity. The following groups were used to identify tumor
initiation: 1 spheroid, 2 spheroids, 10 spheroids, 50 spheroids,
and 500 spheroids. A total of 5,000 freshly isolated OvCSCs
were used as a positive control for the tumor initiation assay.
Spheroids or freshly isolated OvCSCs were injected subcutane-
ously into flank or axilla of nonobese diabetic/severe combined

 immunodeficient/IL2Rg�/� (NSG) mice. Several days following
injection, the injection sites were palpated and measurements
were obtained using a caliper to record tumor volumes. Four to
eight biaxial tumor injections were performed for each group, and
the number of injections that formed tumors was noted and
expressed as percentage-initiating tumors. Tumor volumes were
recorded, until tumors reached an end point of 1,500 to 2,000
mm3, whereupon the mice were euthanized. Tumors were dis-
sected, cleaned, and placed in biopsy cassettes for processing for
histology and subsequent hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining.
In addition, cells were isolated from the tumors using a Tumor
Cell Dissociation Kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated cells were used to
initiate spheroids in hanging drop array plates, with 10 cells in
each drop.
For drug treatment in vivo, tumors were initiated routinely from
10 spheroids of either Pt259 or Pt152 OvCSC samples. Once
palpable tumors were established (�40–50 mm3), mice were
divided into two groups: control untreated and cisplatin/673A
treated. Drug dosing began the day palpable tumors were
obtained, and mice were injected with 1 mg/kg cisplatin intra-
peritoneally once weekly, and 673A at 20 mg/kg intraperitoneally
every day for 21 days or until tumor burden endpoint. When the
endpoint was reached, tumors were dissected and processed for
histology. Routine H&E staining was performed on cross-sections
of tumor xenografts, along with staining for the proliferative
marker Ki67, and the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3. Isolated
cells were used for flow cytometry analysis to determine OvCSC
progeny in control- and drug-treated tumors in vivo.
Statistical analysis
Flow cytometry data were analyzed using Summit software
(Beckman Coulter). Percentage of cells determined positive by
flow cytometry was expressed after analyzing at least 10,000
events per experimental condition. Three to five independent
flow cytometry analyses were performed, to identify an average
percentage of OvCSC populations. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software Inc.). All
data are expressed as mean � SEM and are an average of at least 3
to 8 independent experiments.
Drug viability data were determined and quantified using the
AlamarBlue assay, as outlined previously (29, 30). Briefly, nor-
malized viability was calculated by comparing the AlamarBlue
fluorescence of drug-treated spheroids to control untreated spher-
oids and expressed as a percentage. Statistical analysis was per-
formed using one- or two-way ANOVAs where appropriate, and
levels of statistical significance are indicated in the figures. All data
are expressed as mean � SEM and are an average of at least 3 to 8
independent experiments.
Results
Formation and characterization of OvCSC spheroids from
primary malignant ascites-derived patient samples
Three primary patient ascites samples were chosen from the
tumor bank with a confirmed ovarian cancer origin, Pax8, and p53
expression (Supplementary Fig. S4). OvCSCs were isolated from
the primary ascites samples based on their concurrent expression
of CD133 and elevated ALDH activity. The different patient
samples had unique profiles of expression of ALDHþ, CD133þ,
and ALDHþ CD133þ populations, as indicated in Fig. 1A–C. For
example, the primary Pt224 sample contained 19.8 � 3% ALDHþ
populations, with only 1.2 � 0.3% CD133þ populations
(Fig. 1B). In contrast, the primary Pt152 sample contained only
1.3 � 0.2% ALDHþ populations while CD133þ was high, aver-
aging 18.4 � 3.1% positivity. OvCSCs (ALDHþ CD133þ cells)
were isolated roughly between 0.13% and 0.45% of the total
population of cells analyzed.
Isolated OvCSCs were plated in hanging drop arrays, with 10
cells per drop to generate spheroids. Cells aggregated in the
hanging drop arrays at day 1 and proliferated and compacted
over 7 days to form tight compact OvCSC spheroids (Fig. 1D–F).
Fold proliferation was measured within spheroids using the
AlamarBlue assay, and 6- to 8-fold proliferation was observed in
spheroids from all three patient samples over 7 days in hanging
drop culture.
Consistent with our previous studies (15), flow analysis of
OvCSC spheroids 7 days after seeding (representative plots
shown in Fig. 1G–I), indicated that ALDHþCD133þ cells in
suspension were capable of both self-renewal and differentiation;
all four cell populations (ALDHþCD133þ, ALDHþ CD133�,
ALDH�CD133þ, and ALDH�CD133�) were observed. Quantifi-
cation and comparison of OvCSC populations between the
primary malignant ascites patient sample and OvCSC spheroids
indicated that a similar OvCSC progeny profile was maintained
during hanging drop spheroid culture in our platform (Fig. 1J–L).
Treatment of OvCSC spheroids with cisplatin and ALDH
inhibitor
OvCSC spheroids from Pt259, Pt224, and Pt152 samples
were allowed to form for 7 days and treated with 50 mmol/L
cisplatin,
50
mmol/L
673A
(an
ALDH1A1,
ALDH1A2,
ALDH1A3 specific inhibitor, to be described in a separate
publication), or a combination of both. Control spheroids
were untreated and were maintained for the same duration
in hanging drop culture. The effect of drug was assayed at
72 hours following drug addition, using the AlamarBlue
fluorescence viability assay. Visual microscopic examination
indicated that Pt259 OvCSC spheroids were more sensitive
to cisplatin, 673A, and the combination treatment. Com-
pared with Pt259 spheroids, Pt224 spheroids were more
resistant to the drug treatments, with Pt152 being the most
resistant, indicated by lack of cell death in the micrographs
(Fig. 2A).
Quantification of viability indicated statistically significant
differences in the response of the three different patient samples
to cisplatin/673A chemotherapy (Fig. 2B). Control untreated
spheroids from all three different patient samples were between
93% and 100% viable. However, in cisplatin-treated spheroids,
Pt259 was the most responsive sample, with only 35.4 � 1.9%
viability compared with Pt152, which was the most resistant
sample with 69.6% � 2.4% viability (�, P < 0.001, two-way
ANOVA). Pt259 and Pt224 were most responsive to the ALDH-
targeting compound 673A with only 40% to 49% viability, while
Pt152 spheroids were largely resistant with 70.1% � 2.6% cells
within spheroids still viable. For combination therapies that
included both cisplatin/673A treatments, Pt259 and Pt224 spher-
oids were most sensitive (10%–28% viability), while Pt152
spheroids were significantly more resistant with 44.1% � 1.9%
viability (�, P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA). All three patient samples
were sensitive to combined cisplatin/673A, but to differing
degrees (Fig. 2B; �, P < 0.001, two-way ANOVA), and featured
combination indices of less than 1, indicating synergy between
the drugs.

 Flow analysis determined OvCSC progeny populations affect-
ed by the drug treatment. Cisplatin/673A treatment uniformly
reduced ALDHþ and ALDHþ CD133þ populations in all three
patient samples, while additionally also heavily targeting
CD133þ populations in Pt152 OvCSC spheroids (Fig. 2C). This
indicated that a combination of cisplatin/673A effectively tar-
geted OvCSC populations and progeny (Fig. 2D). Compared with
control untreated spheroids, ALDH and CD133 values were
reduced in all patient samples, and ALDHþ CD133þ populations
were completely annihilated by cisplatin/673A treatment (see
Supplementary Fig. S5 for CSC populations after treatment with
cisplatin and 673A alone).
Treatment of OvCSC spheroids with cisplatin and ruxolitinib
Similar to cisplatin/673A, OvCSC spheroids were treated with
the JAK1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib at 500 nmol/L or in combination
with cisplatin 50 mmol/L. Microscopic examination and viability
quantification both indicated that all three patient samples were
responsive to drug treatments (Fig. 3A and B). Viabilities ranged
from 20.6% (Pt259) to 33.0% (Pt152). Compared with control
untreated spheroids, viability was significantly reduced (�, P <
0.001, two-way ANOVA; Fig. 3B) in all drug treatments in all three
patient samples. Synergy between both drugs was evident from
the combination indices of less than 1 for all three patient
samples. Flow analysis of OvCSC progeny targeted by cisplat-
in/ruxolitinib treatment demonstrated that CD133þ populations
were effectively targeted in all three patient samples, while ALDHþ
populations increased at least in one sample Pt152 (Fig. 3C and D;
see Supplementary Fig. S5 for CSC populations after treatment
with cisplatin and ruxolitinib individually). Even the previously
resistant Pt152 was sensitive to the synergistic cisplatin/ruxoliti-
nib combination treatment, as demonstrated by the loss of
phosphorylated STAT3 in ruxolitinib-treated spheroids (Fig.
3E), in line with reports that note improved sensitivity of ovarian
cancer cells to conventional therapies following STAT3 inhibition
(37, 38). The sensitization observed in our samples under cis-
platin/ruxolitinib treatment could be attributed to the targeting of
the elevated IL6/STAT3 signaling axis reported in resistant ovarian
cancer by the JAK1/2 intermediary inhibitor, ruxolitinib (32, 36).

Spheroids generated from malignant ascites-derived OvCSC maintain OvCSC heterogeneity. A–C, OvCSCs were isolated using FACS from malignant Pt259, Pt224,
and Pt152 ascites based on the concurrent elevated activity of ALDH and CD133 expression. D–F, Spheroids were initiated in hanging drop arrays using
10 Pt259 OvCSCs and observed using phase-contrast microscopy at day 7 (scale bar, 100 mm). G–I, Following spheroid culture for 7 days, harvested spheroids were
processed for flow analysis to identify OvCSC populations in Pt259 OvCSC spheroids; several populations were identified, ALDHþ, CD133þ, ALDH�/CD133�, and
ALDHþ/CD133þ. OvCSC populations within spheroids mimic the primary patient profile. J–L, Quantification of flow analyses indicated that spheroid culture
maintained or enhanced OvCSC populations to similar extents as observed in the primary samples.

 cisplatin/673A treatment. Spheroids were reinitiated with these
cells to preliminarily model tumor reemergence in vitro (Fig. 4A).
All three patient ascites samples reliably formed spheroids, indic-
ative of the ability of residual viable cells to reform a "tumor"
following cisplatin/673A treatment (Fig. 4A). Flow analysis indi-
cated that ALDHþ OvCSC progeny had reliably repopulated
within these spheroids (Fig. 4B), despite their initial depletion
after cisplatin/673A treatment (Fig. 2C). Despite the differential
response to therapy, the remnant resistant cells demonstrated
similar proliferative capacity (Fig. 4C). At the first repassage, the
extent of repopulation of ALDHþ progeny did not match the
original fraction present in these samples (Fig. 1C, G, and K),
except in Pt152 samples where the ALDHþ cells exceeded those in
the original sample (5.1% in spheroids reemerged following
cisplatin/673A treatment vs. 1.4% in spheroids originally initiat-
ed from the primary patient sample; Fig. 4D). These spheroids
were serially passaged over seven cycles, to demonstrate tumor
reemergence over a significant time scale of 7 weeks in vitro (Fig. 4E
and F). Flow analysis indicated that ALDHþ OvCSC progeny had
reliably repopulated within these spheroids (Fig. 4E and F),
despite their initial depletion after cisplatin/673A treatment (Fig.
2C). Theextent of repopulation of ALDHþ,CD133þ,and ALDHþ/
CD133þ progeny approached and even surpassed the original
fraction present in the patient samples (Fig. 1J–L).
Tumor initiation of Pt259 OvCSC spheroids in an NSG mouse
model
We next tested the ability of OvCSC-derived spheroids to
initiate tumors in mice. Subcutaneous tumors were initiated with
Pt259 OvCSC spheroids in NSG mice. As a positive control, 5,000
freshly isolated OvCSC cells from the malignant ascites sample
were used to initiate tumors (Fig. 5A). Photographs of H&E
staining from primary patient samples and tumors xenografts
derived from OvCSC spheroids demonstrate a similar histology
for each sample (Fig. 5B, Supplementary Fig. S6). Ten or more
spheroids were capable of 100% tumor initiation (Fig. 5C). At 6
weeks, two spheroids had an 80% tumor initiation capacity and a
single spheroid had initiated tumors in 16.7% of mice. One
injected spheroid grew at a rate of 12.5 mm3/week, while two
spheroids grew at 36 mm3/week. Ten spheroids grew at 94.3
mm3/week, while 50 spheroids grew at a rate of 181 mm3/week.
In comparison, 5,000 freshly isolated OvCSCs had a lower growth

50 mmol/L/compound673A 50 mmol/L. Control spheroids were untreated, but maintained for the same period in culture. Phase-contrast micrographs at 72 hours

imately 1,500 mm3, tumors were harvested, dispersed as single
cells, and spheroids were reinitiated in hanging drop arrays.
Spheroids were easily generated from the xenografted tumors
(Fig. 5E and F).
Drug treatment and characterization of OvCSC spheroid
xenografts with cisplatin/673A in vivo
Tumors were initiated in NSG mice using 10 OvCSC spheroids
from both Pt259 and Pt152 samples. Once palpable tumors were
formed (�40–50 mm3 in volume), drug treatment with cisplatin/
673A was initiated for 21 days. Consistent with in vitro spheroid
drug sensitivity, Pt259 initiated xenografts demonstrated an
essentially complete response to therapy, where only 1 tumor
(out of 8) was palpable and was able to be excised at the end of the
time period of study (Fig. 6A). Histology of resected tumors
demonstrated significant "treatment effect" with notable cell
death and necrosis throughout (Fig. 6B and C). Widespread
expression of the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 further
indicated the extent of cell death in drug-treated Pt259 xenograft

demonstrated that ALDHþ, CD133þ, and ALDHþ CD133þ popu-
lations were significantly targeted/eliminated with drug treatment
(Fig. 6D).
In contrast to Pt259, consistent with the resistance observed in
spheroids in vitro, Pt152 tumors were only minimally responsive
to cisplatin/673A treatment (Fig. 6E). Visually, no difference in

Discussion
Malignant ascites is a therapeutic challenge in ovarian cancer.
Ascites contains tumor cells growing in suspension as spheroids,
enriched in OvCSCs (7, 11). In the era of personalized medicine,
development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools that can leverage
individual differences between seemingly similar patient samples
and direct a more therapeutically relevant treatment option is of
high importance. Our platform provides an approach to study
and characterize individual patient samples with an OvCSC
context, relevant to drug screening and thestudy of tumor biology.
Several hierarchical markers for OvCSC identification have
been documented, including the dual expression of elevated
ALDH and CD133, with a potential plasticity in the expression
of these markers as cells switch from stem to progenitor to
committed differentiation statuses (12, 15, 20, 39). Operation-
ally, OvCSCs are cells with both increased tumor initiation
capacity and the ability to asymmetrically divide to generate
non-self cells, recreating the heterogeneity of the primary patients'
malignancy (26).
Owing to the fact that CSCs are notoriously plastic, and main-
taining them in an undifferentiated state to study their role in drug
resistance has been difficult in vitro (26), we developed a spheroid
model where we could isolate OvCSCs (based on ALDHþ
CD133þ) from primary patient malignant ascites and incorporate
them into a 3D structure wherein OvCSC populations are similar
to those observed in the primary patient sample, indicating a
strong use for this platform in personalized medicine for drug
screening with an OvCSC context.
We examined OvCSC progeny within our spheroids based on
ALDH and CD133 alone, as their expressions have been previ-
ously reported to be partially rescued with spheroid and serum-
free in vitro culture, compared with other OvCSC markers (20). In
fact, spheroids initiated from specific OvCSC subsets (ALDHþ
only, CD133þ only, ALDH�/CD133�) had different sensitivities
Figure 5.

 when treated with cisplatin, as demonstrated in Supplementary
Fig. S7. The likelihood of other heterogeneous markers, including
CD24, CD44, CD117, etc, present in ovarian tumors and their
contributions to a phenotype cannot be ruled out (40, 41).
Our spheroid model demonstrated that with the suspension
culture, not only is the nonadherent ascites microenvironment
partially recapitulated, but the populations of OvCSCs and their
progeny are recapitulated to the same levels as observed in the
primary patient ascites samples, thereby maintaining the hetero-
geneity of the tumor and making a subsequent drug study phys-
iologically relevant and customizable for individual patient
samples.
Indeed, in line with previously published research, the use of
cisplatin along with the ALDH targeting compound 673A resulted
in a marked loss of ALDHþ OvCSC progeny within spheroids
(31, 42). Our platform was able to discern the sensitivity of the
three different patient samples to the synergistic cisplatin/673A
and cisplatin/ruxolitinib combination therapies, and this corre-
lated with their clinical history for platinum response, as well as
the amounts of OvCSC populations contained within the primary
and spheroid samples. On the basis of the initial clinical therapy
response to platinum-based chemotherapy, ovarian cancer
patients are classified into three categories: platinum refractory,
platinum resistant, and platinum responsive. Platinum-refractory
patients do not respond to platinum-based therapy and show
progression during the course of the therapy. Meanwhile, plati-
num-resistant tumors can recur within 6 months of cisplatin
treatment, and although considered incurable, are still responsive
to chemotherapy to a variable degree (34). Our data demonstrate
differences in therapeutic response between patient samples and
also represent the variability in the clinical response to chemo-
therapy after recurrence. The implications of these findings
strengthen the platform and its utility toward personalized med-
icine, wherein individual patient samples can be tested with a
higher fidelity for drug response, compared with conventional
monolayer drug screens (Supplementary Fig. S8).
This is an important in vitro platform that can be developed to
model and study tumor reemergence following drug treatment.
By sorting for live cells that escape chemotherapy, and reforming
spheroids with them in a long-term in vitro culture setting, one can
potentially study the phenotypes of these cells that make them
inherently more chemoresistant than parent primary tumors. We
were unable to reform spheroids from cells following cisplatin/
ruxolitinib treatment, in line with studies that demonstrate that
the repassaging ability of spheres is severely limited following
JAK1/2 and subsequent pSTAT3 inhibition in CSCs (35, 43),
which we observe in ruxolitinib-treated spheroids (Fig. 3E).
Finally, the hanging drop spheroid platform appears to be an
excellent means to expand rare tumor cells ex vivo for primary
tumor generation. Our xenograft model demonstrates that as few
as one injected spheroid (initiated with 10 cells/spheroid) is
capable of generating tumors in NSG mice with 16.7% success
while two spheroids are capable of >80% tumor generation
efficiency. With as few as 10 injected spheroids, we obtained
100% efficiency in initiating tumors. The tumor establishment
times were also significantly shorter in our spheroid–xenograft
Figure 6.
Drug response of OvCSC xenografts match drug response of patient malignant ascites-derived OvCSC spheroids treated with cisplatin/673A. A, Tumors were
initiated from Pt259 and Pt152 spheroids using 10 injected spheroids. Once palpable tumors were obtained, control groups received a sham saline injection,
while the experimental drug group received cisplatin/673A. Tumor volumes of control (black trace) and drug-treated (red trace) Pt259 xenografts are plotted,
indicating a decrease in volume of drug-treated Pt259 xenografts compared with control. Shaded gray area indicates the window for tumor burden
(1,500–2,000 mm3) upon which mice were sacrificed. B, H&E and proliferative index marker Ki67 staining of control Pt259 xenograft tumor cross-sections (scale bar,

populations. E, Tumor volumes of control (black trace) and drug-treated (red trace) Pt152 tumors, where there is minimal difference in tumor volumes
between the two experimental conditions. Shaded gray area indicates the window for tumor burden (1,500–2,000 mm3) upon which mice were sacrificed. F, H&E and
Ki67 staining of Pt152 xenografts visually demonstrate no difference in proliferative index when compared with Pt259 xenografts (scale bar, 100 mm).
G, H&E and cleaved caspase-3 staining of Pt152 xenograft tumor cross-sections indicate minimal cell death in cisplatin/673A–treated tumors compared with control

 model system, compared with latency reported previously for
ovarian cancer PDX samples (�74 days; ref. 44) or ovarian cancer
tumor-initiating cells (60–102 days; ref. 41). Liao and colleagues
(45) also reported reduced tumor latency times (31–54 days)
when injecting cells derived from spheroids, compared with bulk
parental cells. Our spheroid–xenograft model demonstrates sim-
ilar or lower latency times, indicating that spheroid formation and
maintenance magnifies the tumorigenicity of OvCSC cells. Taken
together, these results suggest that this platform could be used to
rapidly establish patient xenografts from limited specimens, such
as core biopsies.
As we obtained dramatically different responses to in vitro
cisplatin/673A treatment between Pt259 and Pt152 spheroids,
we treated the xenografts initiated from these two patient samples
in vivo with cisplatin/673A. Our data indicated that drug dose
responses obtained in vitro in spheroids matched the response of
xenografted tumors in vivo very closely. Flow analysis of drug-
treated tumors in vivo compared with control tumors also indi-
cated that cisplatin/673A in combination was able to target
ALDHþ populations in Pt259 effectively, and not as effectively
in Pt152 xenografts, similar to in vitro data. This further strength-
ens the predictive potency of the in vitro hanging drop platform to
assay drug responses in patient samples, with a clear OvCSC
context.
In conclusion, we have demonstrated a robust in vitro platform
that incorporates primary patient malignant ascites-derived
OvCSCs into spheroids. These spheroids recapitulate primary
tumor specimens, suggesting a strong application for this plat-
form in personalized medicine and spheroid biology studies. Our
platform possesses the ability to investigate biological properties
of malignant OvCSCs, while retaining their tumorigenic potential
upon transplantation. Responses to varying drug treatments
(including cisplatin, 673A, and ruxolitinib) are different in the
patient samples investigated and correlate with in vivo drug studies
in murine xenografts, indicating that the spheroid platform has a
high predictive potency for drug dose responses. The spheroid
intermediary for OvCSCs also dramatically reduces the latency
times of tumor establishment. Finally, our platform can also be
used to study and model tumor biology from a reemergence of
tumor after drug treatment perspective, to allow for closer inves-
tigation of the phenotype of cells that escape primary chemo-
therapy. As the role of aberrant somatic mutations in serous
ovarian cancer pathophysiology is still emerging (46, 47), this
platform can play a strong role in stratifying seemingly similar
patient samples and leveraging individual differences in tumor
growth rates, biology, OvCSC composition, and therapeutic resis-
tance to direct more precise therapies in a personalized
standpoint.
