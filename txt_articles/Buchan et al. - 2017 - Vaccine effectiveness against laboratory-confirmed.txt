Abstract
Uncertainty remains regarding the magnitude of effectiveness of influenza vaccines for pre-
venting serious outcomes, especially among young children. We estimated vaccine effec-
tiveness (VE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations among children aged
6–59 months. We used the test-negative design in hospitalized children in Ontario, Canada
during the 2010–11 to 2013–14 influenza seasons. We used logistic regression models
adjusted for age, season, and time within season to calculate VE estimates by vaccination
status (full vs. partial), age group, and influenza season. We also assessed VE incorporating
prior history of influenza vaccination. We included specimens from 9,982 patient hospitaliza-
tion episodes over four seasons, with 12.8% testing positive for influenza. We observed vari-
ation in VE by vaccination status, age group, and influenza season. For the four seasons
combined, VE was 60% (95%CI, 44%-72%) for full vaccination and 39% (95%CI, 17%-
56%) for partial vaccination. VE for full vaccination was 67% (95%CI, 48%-79%) for children
aged 24–59 months, 48% (95%CI, 12%-69%) for children aged 6–23 months, 77% (95%CI,
47%-90%) for 2010–11, 59% (95%CI, 13%-81%) for 2011–12, 33% (95%CI, –18% to 62%)
for 2012–13, and 72% (95%CI, 42%-86%) for 2013–14. VE in children aged 24–59 months
appeared similar between those vaccinated in both the current and previous seasons and
those vaccinated in the current season only, with the exception of 2012–13, when VE was

Data Availability Statement: Data cannot be made
publicly available due to the ethical and legal
requirements implemented by the Institute for
Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES) and Ontario’s
Information and Privacy Commissioner (IPC). The
data sets used in this study are held securely in
coded form at ICES under the auspices of data
sharing agreements with the various data
providers. Due to privacy concerns and the risk of
re-identification, these data sharing agreements
 lower for those vaccinated in the current season only. Influenza vaccination is effective in
preventing pediatric laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations during most seasons.
Introduction
Rates of influenza-attributable hospitalizations are as high among young children as older
adults [1]. Canada’s National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) identifies chil-
dren aged 6–23 months as a priority group for vaccination, and added children aged 24–59
months to the list of recommended recipients starting in the 2012–13 influenza season [2].
Uncertainty remains regarding vaccine effectiveness (VE) against serious outcomes, including
hospitalizations and deaths, especially among young children. Indeed, the latest Cochrane
review reported no conclusive evidence that influenza vaccines reduce hospitalizations among
children younger than two years of age [3].
In addition, the impact of repeated vaccination on VE has been a topic of recent contro-
versy,[4] but few studies have focused on children or hospitalized patients. Ohmit et al. found
no negative impact of repeated vaccination on VE in children younger than 9 years of age in
2013–14 when A/H1N1 circulated. This contrasted with their results from the prior season
when A/H3N2 dominated and VE was higher for those vaccinated in the current season only
[5]. Thompson et al. examined this phenomenon in children younger than 8 years of age in
2012–13 and found similar VE estimates for those vaccinated in the current season only and
those vaccinated in both the prior and current seasons [6].
The objective of this study was to evaluate influenza VE against hospitalizations for young
children aged 6–59 months for the 2010–11 to 2013–14 seasons in Ontario, Canada. We also
assessed the impact of repeated influenza vaccination in young children.
Patients and methods
Study population, setting, and design
We studied children aged 6–59 months who were hospitalized during the 2010–11 to 2013–14
influenza seasons in Ontario. Individual-level laboratory data were collected from a network
of laboratories and linked using unique encoded identifiers to health administrative data,
including hospital records and physician billing claims, at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative
Sciences (ICES).
We estimated VE using the test-negative design (TND) [7, 8]. We included all respiratory
specimens tested for influenza; those with laboratory-confirmed influenza served as cases and
those testing negative served as controls. The study was restricted to periods when influenza
was in circulation, based on a threshold level of 5% positivity on tested respiratory specimens
for the province (S1 Table).
Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre
Research Ethics Board and the Office of Research Ethics at the University of Toronto, Toronto,
Canada. Written or verbal informed consent was not required from the subjects in this study,
as ICES is permitted to obtain and use personal health information without patient consent for
specific purposes, as outlined in Ontario’s Personal Health Information Protection Act. All data
were fully anonymized before access by the researchers, and the requirement for informed
consent was waived by the aforementioned ethics committees.

 Data sources and definitions
Laboratory testing.
We included respiratory specimens tested at five hospitals and 11
public health laboratories distributed across the province. We included specimens tested using
monoplex and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), viral culture, direct immunofluo-
rescence assay (DFA), or enzyme immunoassay tests (EIA). In this dataset, 62.3% of children
were tested using PCR, 22.0% with viral culture, 15.8% with DFA and 0.3% with EIA.
Hospitalizations.
Hospitalizations were identified using the Canadian Institute of Health
Information Discharge Abstract Database. We restricted the analysis to individuals with speci-
mens collected within three days of hospital admission (96% of the sample) to minimize the
inclusion of hospital-acquired influenza infections. We included one hospitalization with a
specimen collected per individual per season. For individuals with multiple specimens col-
lected during multiple hospitalizations within a season, we included the first hospitalization
with a specimen positive for influenza (cases), or the first hospitalization if all specimens col-
lected within the season were negative (controls).
Influenza vaccination.
We used physician billing claims recorded in the Ontario Health
Insurance Plan (OHIP) database to ascertain influenza vaccination status. Children were classi-
fied as fully vaccinated if they had two influenza vaccination billing claims in the current season
with administration dates �28 days apart, or one billing claim in the current season with
another billing claim in any prior season, and if the administration date of the dose(s) in the
current season was �14 days before specimen collection date. Children were classified as par-
tially vaccinated if they received two doses in the current season with the second <28 days after
the first or <14 days before specimen collection date, or if they received only one of two recom-
mended doses in the current season (�14 days before specimen collection date). Both trivalent
(TIV) and quadrivalent (QIV) inactivated vaccines are recommended for those aged 6–23
months but only TIV products were available in Ontario during the study period. For the
2011–12 to 2013–14 seasons, live attenuated inactivated vaccines (LAIV) were preferentially
recommended over inactivated vaccines for healthy children aged 24–59 months, but they were
not part of the publicly funded immunization program and therefore had minimal uptake [2].
Covariates.
We used health administrative data to identify demographic characteristics,
underlying health conditions (including asthma, diabetes, and cancer), and prior healthcare
use, including past hospitalizations and continuity of care (defined as the percentage of pri-
mary care visits assigned to the child’s primary care provider). We used postal code of resi-
dence to assign neighbourhood income quintile (based on census-derived neighbourhood
income) and rurality. We modified Feudtner et al.’s methodology [9] to suit the available data
to assign complex chronic condition (CCC) status using physician billing and hospital claims
(S2 Table). Birthweight and gestational age were determined from the mother’s delivery hospi-
talization record.
Statistical analysis
We used logistic regression to estimate VE by comparing the odds of vaccination in the cases
to the odds of vaccination in the controls. VE was calculated as (1–ORadjusted)x100%. We esti-
mated VE for full and partial vaccination status separately. A priori, we controlled for age (in
months), season, and time within season (month relative to peak) in the adjusted estimates
[10, 11]. All potential confounders were evaluated for inclusion in the adjusted model using
the Hosmer and Lemeshow forward model building strategy [12], but no additional covariates
were included.
We tested for a difference in VE between fully and partially vaccinated children by calculat-
ing the odds ratio with those partially vaccinated as our reference [6]. We performed subgroup

 analyses by season, subtype, age group, sex, presence of a CCC, and time within season. In sen-
sitivity analyses, we restricted the analysis to individuals with specimens collected during a hos-
pitalization with an acute respiratory illness (ARI) diagnostic code recorded in any of the
diagnosis fields in the hospitalization record (S3 Table); we evaluated the addition of any
comorbidity (any CCC, diabetes, asthma, and/or cancer) on VE estimates; and we accounted
for the possibility of misclassification of our exposure measurement [13], since not all influenza
vaccinations are recorded in the OHIP database. As there are no published values for the sensi-
tivity and specificity of physician billing codes for influenza vaccination of children younger
than 5 years of age, we extrapolated measures from available data to this age group [14, 15]. To
demonstrate specificity of the association between influenza vaccination and influenza hospital-
ization, we evaluated the association between influenza vaccination and laboratory-confirma-
tion of one of four non-influenza respiratory viruses (respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus,
parainfluenza, or human metapneumovirus), for which no association was expected.
To assess the impact of repeated vaccination, we estimated VE for any vaccination in those
aged 24–59 months by vaccination history using a categorical indicator variable for those vac-
cinated in both the current and prior seasons, the current season only, the prior season only,
and neither season (i.e., four mutually exclusive groups).
We tested two main assumptions of the TND: 1) influenza testing is not associated with
vaccination status; and 2) vaccination status is not associated with non-influenza respiratory
viruses [7, 8, 16].
All analyses were conducted using SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
All tests were two-sided and used p<0.05 as the level of statistical significance.
Results
We included 9,982 hospitalization events during which a respiratory specimen was collected
and tested for influenza for 9,547 unique children. A minority of children (4.1%) were
included in more than one season. A total of 1,280 (12.8%) individuals had specimens that
tested positive for influenza (range across seasons: 11.5%-14.5%). Across seasons, 1,151
(11.5%) children were classified as having received at least one influenza vaccination (range
across seasons: 10.0%-13.8%), with 6.0% fully vaccinated and 5.6% partially vaccinated. Of the
882 individuals who tested positive for influenza A, 451 were subtyped, with 163 positive for
A/H1N1 only, and 286 positive for A/H3N2 only. There were 402 individuals who tested posi-
tive for influenza B (including �5 influenza A/B coinfections); lineage information was not
available. Influenza-positive children were more likely to be unvaccinated, older, reside in
urban areas, and to be admitted during the peak influenza month (Table 1 and S4 Table). Chil-
dren who had a CCC or asthma, a past intensive care unit (ICU) admission, or a history of low
birthweight or preterm birth were more likely to be vaccinated (Table 2 and S5 Table).
The overall adjusted VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization was 60.4%
(95%CI, 44.0%-72.1%) for fully vaccinated children and 39.2% (95%CI, 16.6%-55.6%) for par-
tially vaccinated children (Table 3; unadjusted results in S6 Table). Full vaccination offered sta-
tistically significant protection for three of the four influenza seasons studied, whereas partial
vaccination offered protection for two seasons. VE for any vaccination was higher for children
aged 24–59 months relative to those aged 6–23 months (p-value for interaction = 0.012). VE
appeared higher for fully vaccinated children in all sub-analyses except against A/H3N2; how-
ever, the only statistically significant difference in VE by vaccination status was observed
against influenza B (p = 0.03). Partial vaccination was not significantly protective against influ-
enza for the 2011–12 or 2012–13 seasons, against A/H1N1 or influenza B, for children aged
6–23 months, or for children with asthma.

 VE estimates were unchanged when we restricted to children with specimens collected dur-
ing an ARI-coded hospitalization and when we included any comorbidity in our model
(Table 3). When we corrected for misclassification of our exposure measurement based on the
most plausible estimates of sensitivity (77%) and specificity (98%), VE for any vaccination
changed from 50.8% (95%CI, 37.6%-61.2%) to 60.7% (95%CI, 47.9%-70.6%). We performed
these sensitivity analyses on a range of estimates to determine their potential impact on VE

were similar (Fig 1a), though there was variation by year (Fig 1b). In the 2010–11 and 2011–12
seasons and for A/H3N2, VE appeared higher for those vaccinated in the current season only,
though the reverse was seen in the 2012–13 season; however, confidence intervals were wide
due to small numbers. Confidence intervals were also wide when examining residual protec-
tion based on prior season vaccination only.
For patients who had an ARI code associated with their hospitalization, 46% were tested for
influenza. Among these ARI-coded hospitalizations, 12.6% of patients who were tested for
influenza were vaccinated, compared to 12.4% of patients who were not tested for influenza
(p = 0.56), confirming the absence of an association between influenza testing and vaccination

 status. Using the 95% of our sample that were tested for at least one other respiratory virus,
32.2% of unvaccinated children tested positive for another respiratory virus compared to
32.1% of children with any vaccination (p = 0.96), confirming the absence of an association
between vaccination status and non-influenza respiratory viruses. This assumption held for
fully, partially, and unvaccinated children, as well as between age groups and across seasons.
Discussion
During the 2010–11 to 2013–14 influenza seasons, vaccination reduced the risk of laboratory-
confirmed influenza hospitalizations by 60% for fully vaccinated children aged 6–59 months
and by 39% for partially vaccinated children in Ontario. We observed statistically significant
VE for fully vaccinated children for all seasons except 2012–13, and for all subgroups except
those infected by A/H3N2. We did not detect statistically significant VE for partially vacci-
nated children during the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons, or for those aged 6–23 months, those
with asthma, and those with influenza A/H1N1 or B infections.
Our estimates are generally consistent with previous studies that have assessed VE among
young children for these four seasons (Table 4), but direct comparisons are difficult due to
varying healthcare settings (inpatient versus outpatient), geographical locations, and age
groups studied [5, 17–35]. The sole previous study of VE against laboratory-confirmed influ-
enza hospitalizations specifically in young children aged 6–59 months reported an estimate of
75% (95%CI, –100% to 97%) for the 2012 southern hemisphere influenza season in New Zea-
land [33]. Our estimate for 2011–12 of 54% (95%CI, 19%-73%) is well within the wide confi-
dence interval of that study. Assuming that VE estimates for hospitalization and outpatient
outcomes should be consistent, as suggested in a recent systematic review [36], our results are

 remarkably similar to estimates from the United Kingdom for 2010–11 (VE = 73%; 95%CI,
53%-85% versus 72%; 95%CI, 12%-91%) and 2011–12 (VE = 54%; 95%CI, 19%-73% versus
52%; 95%CI, –446% to 96%), but our estimates had tighter confidence intervals [22, 27]. Relax-
ing the age criteria to include children as old as 19 years, our estimates are congruent with esti-
mates from North America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia for the 2010–11, 2011–12, and
2013–14 seasons [5, 17–20, 25, 29, 31, 34, 35].
In contrast, our estimate for the 2012–13 season was consistent with some estimates (that
may have included outpatients and/or older children) from USA and Europe [23, 25, 26], but
not estimates from Canada, China, Hong Kong, or New Zealand [18, 19, 21, 30, 32]. In Can-
ada, mutations in the egg-adapted A/H3N2 vaccine strain resulted in lowered VE [30]. The
Influenza-Monitoring Vaccine Effectiveness (I-MOVE) network found low VE in 2012–13 for
children aged <14 years who received inactivated split vaccine [23]. Since most influenza vac-
cines distributed in Canada are also split vaccines, this could be a potential explanation,
although it is still inconsistent with another Canadian estimate, albeit one that included older
children and data from other provinces [30].

 Given the interest in examining whether influenza vaccination impacts severity of infection,
we compared the estimates from our inpatient study to other Canadian outpatient estimates
(for children aged 1–19 years) [29–31]. Our estimates were similar with overlapping confi-
dence intervals for 2011–12 (VE = 64%; 95%CI, 23%-84% in outpatients versus 54%; 95%CI,
19%-73% in inpatients) and 2013–14 (VE = 77%; 95%CI, 47%-90% in outpatients versus 60%;
95%CI, 37%-75% in inpatients), but not for 2012–13 (VE = 87%; 95%CI, 65%-95% in outpa-
tients versus 12%; 95%CI, –31%-40% in inpatients). Understanding such discrepancies
deserves further study.
We found higher VE against A/H3N2 in partially vaccinated children relative to those fully
vaccinated, which is consistent with previous work [6, 37]. This may be because children are
defined as fully vaccinated either through receipt of two doses in their first season or one dose
if they had been vaccinated in any prior season. Differentiating the effect of partial vaccination
versus repeated vaccination is challenging in this age group as we may be inherently studying
the effect of repeated vaccination when examining fully vaccinated children. For A/H3N2, we
estimated higher VE for those vaccinated in the current season only, which is equivalent to
partial vaccination in certain circumstances. In the future, studies focusing on this age group
should differentiate between the two types of full vaccination when estimating VE.
Among children aged 24–59 months, we found no difference in VE between those vacci-
nated in the current season only compared to those vaccinated in both prior and current sea-
sons. However, we were limited by our sample size from evaluating the impact of repeated
vaccination by subtype. This analysis could also only consider vaccination in two consecutive
seasons rather than serial vaccination, although the number of vaccines in this age group
would be limited. Our results may not generalize to older individuals with longer histories of
both influenza and influenza vaccine exposure.
Our study has several strengths. We were able to test some of the assumptions that are rou-
tinely mentioned in test-negative studies but never evaluated. Specifically, we confirmed that
vaccination status was not associated with influenza testing and that influenza vaccination was
not associated with testing positive for other respiratory viruses. Pooling data across several
years allowed for the evaluation of VE in selected subgroups of interest, and the nature of the
vaccination data permitted evaluation of the impact of repeated vaccination in a population
with limited previous vaccine exposure. The size of our study population was enhanced by
including numerous types of high-specificity laboratory tests. While values for sensitivity and
specificity may vary by testing method, in TND studies with laboratory-confirmed outcomes,
specificity is more important in terms of bias [38].
This study had several limitations. Symptom onset date was only available for the minority
(16%) of specimens, but since children shed higher levels of virus for longer periods of time
and we restricted to those tested within three days of hospital admission, absence of symptom
onset date is less likely to be an issue in this age group [39]. Further, there was no strict case
definition for initiating influenza testing, though this would not be expected to be different
between test-positives and test-negatives. Further, 88% of individuals with specimens tested
were collected during an ARI-coded hospitalization, which may serve as a proxy for testing cri-
teria. Our VE estimates were unchanged when restricting the sample to individuals with speci-
mens collected during ARI-coded hospitalizations. Vaccination status was determined from
physician billing claims; children who received a vaccination at public health clinics may have
been misclassified. Children in this age group are not eligible for vaccination through pharma-
cists and the majority (77%) of children in this age group receive influenza vaccination
through physicians [14]. We would not expect differential misclassification by influenza case
status, and our VE estimates would therefore be conservative. While we may have underesti-
mated coverage relative to other studies, our data reflect vaccination status relative to the date

 of influenza testing in a hospitalized cohort, and do not reflect estimates of vaccine coverage
for the influenza season [14]. Further, the vaccinated proportion is similar to that of other
Canadian studies [29–31], though differences in setting and vaccination data sources may
explain any residual differences. Differentiating TIV, QIV, and LAIV was not possible with the
available data. However, neither LAIV nor QIV were publicly funded in Ontario until the
2015–16 influenza season, therefore most children in this study would have received TIV. We
were limited by low influenza vaccine coverage, which impacted our power to detect signifi-
cant VE in certain groups, especially when considering the importance of evaluating VE by full
and partial vaccination status [40]. Coverage appeared low in our sample relative to other esti-
mates, perhaps because some vaccinations may have not been documented or because previ-
ous survey results over-estimated coverage [14]. Compared with surveillance-based methods,
this approach is insufficiently timely to produce mid-season or end-of-season results to inform
program planning. Last, the subtype-specific estimates were limited because only half of indi-
viduals positive for influenza A had specimens that were subtyped.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates VE against laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations for chil-
dren aged 6–59 months. Despite variation across subgroups, we observed substantial protec-
tion for vaccinated children, particularly if fully vaccinated. These results support current
recommendations to promote vaccination in this high-risk group.
