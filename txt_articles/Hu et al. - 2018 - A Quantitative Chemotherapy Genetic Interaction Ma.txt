SUMMARY
Chemotherapy is used to treat most cancer patients,
yet our understanding of factors that dictate res-
ponse and resistance to such drugs remains limited.
We report the generation of a quantitative chemical-
genetic interaction map in human mammary epithe-
lial cells charting the impact of the knockdown
of 625 genes related to cancer and DNA repair on
sensitivity to 29 drugs, covering all classes of chemo-
therapy. This quantitative map is predictive of
interactions maintained in other cell lines, identifies
DNA-repair factors, predicts cancer cell line re-
sponses to therapy, and prioritizes synergistic drug
combinations. We identify that ARID1A loss confers
resistance to PARP inhibitors in cells and ovarian
cancer patients and that loss of GPBP1 causes resis-
tance to cisplatin and PARP inhibitors through the
regulation of genes involved in homologous recom-
bination. This map helps navigate patient genomic
data and optimize chemotherapeutic regimens by
delineating factors involved in the response to spe-
cific types of DNA damage.
INTRODUCTION
Chemotherapy is given to the vast majority of cancer patients and
used based on average responses rather than personalized deci-
sions (Barcenas et al., 2014). Limited improvements in survival by
the use of chemotherapy also highlight the need to develop drugs
and make better use of existing drugs (Early Breast Cancer Tria-
lists’ Collaborative Group, 2005). Furthermore, choosing from
multiple possible chemotherapy options can complicate clinical
decision making. Therefore, optimizing the use of chemotherapies
is a significant and pressing challenge in precision oncology. Che-
motherapies commonly target the heightened proliferation result-
ing from unrestrained cell-cycle and DNA-damage checkpoints
present in cancer cells, but their narrow therapeutic window re-
sults in the dose-limiting toxicities common with these agents.
While tumors that harbor specific alterations in DNA-repair genes
such as BRCA1, BRCA2, and ERCC1 are more responsive to
certain chemotherapies (Byrski et al., 2012; Olaussen et al.,
2006), our knowledge of relevant biomarkers for chemotherapy
remains limited. Therefore, understanding the impact that tumor
mutations have on modifying drug responses can lead to more
efficient use of chemotherapy.
Recent advances in genomics have led to a dramatic increase
in the rate of discovery of altered genes in patient tumors. This
explosion in knowledge has led to bottlenecks at the level of a
functional understanding of tumor genomes, a key step in thera-
peutic development. Chemical-genetic interaction maps can aid
in elucidating roles for genetic events in cancers by causally link-
ing them to drug sensitivity (Martins et al., 2015; Muellner et al.,
2011). Furthermore, effectively connecting gene alterations with
therapeutics will also require clarity regarding the exact mecha-
nism of drug actions, which are often lacking for classical
chemotherapeutic agents as well as newly developed drugs tar-
geting DNA repair and processing (Cheung-Ong et al., 2013; Hel-
leday, 2011; Liu et al., 2012; Mitchison, 2012). In the case of
PARP inhibitors, their efficacy may be dependent on their ability
to trap PARP onto DNA, leading to DNA double-strand breaks
during replication rather than blocking the repair of single-strand
breaks through enzymatic inhibition of PARP, as initially hypoth-
esized (Helleday, 2011; Murai et al., 2012). It is likely that insights
into the mechanisms of action of chemotherapies will need to be
combined with an understanding of gene function in order to
create predictive models of drug responses in patients.
A key milestone in the field was the discovery that tumor cells
that are deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are sensitive to PARP in-
hibitors in a synthetic lethal manner, ultimately leading to
approval of these agents for the treatment of ovarian cancer.
Mechanistically, this synthetic lethal interaction takes advantage
of a deficiency in homologous recombination (HR) caused by
BRCA1/2 mutation that is necessary to repair DNA lesions
incurred by PARP inhibition (Bryant et al., 2005; Farmer et al.,
2005). With the approval of several PARP inhibitors, both
de novo and acquired resistance to PARP inhibitors have
become an important clinical problem. What appears to be crit-
ical for resistance is the restoration of HR that, in some cases,
can be attributed to secondary intragenic mutations, which re-
stores BRCA1 or BRCA2 functionality (Norquist et al., 2011).
Although additional factors have been reported, little is known

 about their relevance to resistance in the clinic (Lord and Ash-
worth, 2013). Central to emerging mechanisms of resistance is
the interplay between two major repair pathways, non-homolo-
gous end joining (NHEJ) and HR. In a competitive model
between these two pathways, the NHEJ factor TP53BP1 sup-
presses HR, and TP53BP1 loss restores HR, facilitating PARP in-
hibitor resistance (Bouwman et al., 2010; Bunting et al., 2010;
Chapman et al., 2012). However, TP53BP1 loss has not been
observed in patients, suggesting that additional factors may
contribute to the resistant phenotype.
Here, we generate a systematic resource that quantitatively
maps the influence of the knockdown of 612 DNA-repair and
cancer-relevant genes on the responses to 31 chemotherapeutic
agents in breast cancer, covering nearly all major Food and Drug
Administration (FDA)-approved chemotherapies. We demon-
strate that the map recovers many known modulators of chemo-
sensitivity and is able to link therapies with common mecha-
nisms of action. We show that the map is a predictive tool to
computationally infer cancer cell line drug sensitivity and design
drug combinations with targeted inhibitors of ATR and APEX1.
We also identify ARID1A and GPBP1 as factors whose loss con-
tributes to PARP inhibitor and platinum resistance, a finding that
is supported by data from HGSOC patients. This chemical-ge-
netic interaction map can be used to identify factors that dictate
responses to chemotherapy and aid in the translation from tumor
genomics to therapeutics.
RESULTS
Generation of a Chemotherapy-Based Genetic
Interaction Map in Breast Epithelial Cells
We developed a quantitative chemical-genetic interaction map-
ping strategy to uncover the impact of gene loss on proliferative
responses to a panel of approved chemotherapies as well as
emerging inhibitors of DNA repair. Beyond common tumor sup-
pressor genes, we focused on genes recurrently deleted in
breast and ovarian cancer. We mined The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA) studies as well as the METABRIC breast cancer cohort,
covering over 3,000 samples to identify a set of over 200 breast
and 170 ovarian cancer genes whose deletion occurred with high
frequency in these studies (Figure 1A; Table S1) (Cancer
Genome Atlas Network, 2012; Cancer Genome Atlas Research
Network, 2011; Curtis et al., 2012). We also included nearly all
genes known to be involved in DNA repair (n = 134). As a comple-
ment, we assembled a collection of 29 distinct compounds en-
compassing nearly all FDA-approved chemotherapies for breast
and ovarian cancer, four PARP inhibitors, and two other targeted
therapies (Figure 1B). In addition, we profiled two common drug
combinations, for a total of 31 distinct treatments. The map was
generated in MCF10A cells, which are immortal, epithelial,
diploid, HR competent, and devoid of mutations in known
oncogenes (Debnath et al., 2002). By molecular profiling, these
cells are receptor-negative or basal-like, a subtype that has
been shown to be similar in biology and etiology to high-grade
serous ovarian cancer (Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012).
Knockdowns were performed using endonuclease-prepared
siRNAs (esiRNAs), which are enzymatically cleaved long dou-
ble-stranded RNAs that exist in a pool with high sequence
complexity and exhibit fewer off-target effects than synthetic
siRNA (small interfering RNA)-based approaches (Kittler et al.,
2007). To generate the chemical-genetic interaction map,
MCF10A
cells
were
transfected
with
individual
esiRNAs,
exposed to either DMSO or drug, and allowed to proliferate for
72 hr before counting. Knockdown of an essential gene, KIF11,
was used as positive control in the screen (Figure S1A). Normal-
ized cell numbers from each knockdown in the presence of drug
or DMSO were compared to identify differences in proliferation
over 8 replicates (4 in each condition), and the significance of
this difference was converted into a signed chemical-genetic
interaction score (S) (Experimental Procedures; Martins et al.,
2015). Positive S scores indicate that the gene loss caused
drug resistance, and negative S scores indicate that gene loss
induced drug sensitivity that could constitute a synthetic lethal
interaction. Analysis of the distribution of scores based on
knockdown of GFP as negative control allowed the assignment
of false discovery rates (FDRs) of 10%, 5%, and <1% to cutoffs
of S = ±3, ±4, and ±5, respectively (Figure 1C). Altogether, we
determined quantitative scores for 19,406 gene-drug interac-
tions and identified 1,042 positive and 740 negative interactions
at S = ±3, corresponding to a 10% FDR (Table S2). These inter-
actions mapped to a median of 27 positive and 22 negative inter-
actions per drug (Figure S1B).
As a control, we examined the impact of loss of BRCA proteins
on sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, a known synthetic lethal inter-
action (Bryant et al., 2005; Farmer et al., 2005). Loss of BRCA1
or BRCA2 was among the most synthetic lethal with PARP inhib-
itors in our dataset, including strong interactions with the PARP
inhibitor BMN673 (BRCA1 S = �4.4; BRCA2 S = �5.6). This
finding also extended to members of the BRCA pathway,
SHFM1 (S = �2.9) and PALB2 (S = �4.9), which mediate HR
as previously reported (Figure 1D) (Buisson et al., 2010; McCabe
et al., 2006). We also observed strong synthetic lethal interac-
tions between BRCA1/2- and BRCA-pathway genes and DNA
cross-linking agents cisplatin and mitomycin C (BRCA1 with
cisplatin, S = �5.8; and with mitomycin C, S = �5.1) (Figure 1D).
Synthetic lethality of BRCA1 with PARP inhibitors is related to the
ability of the drug to trap PARP onto chromatin (Murai et al.,
2014; Shen et al., 2013). Using the map, we asked whether this
trend extends beyond BRCA1 to the entire HR pathway. We
examined known genes involved in HR and found that they
were also often synthetic lethal with PARP inhibitors in a manner
that was related to the degree of PARP trapping onto DNA
(Figure
1E). Illustrating
this
point,
the
strongest
trapper,
BMN673, had an average score of �2.4 with 19 known compo-
nents of HR (p = 3.1e�4), which was lower than with any other
PARP inhibitor. Since these drugs are comparable inhibitors of
PARP enzymatic activity, our results indicate that synthetic
lethality with loss of components of HR machinery is more
dependent on PARP trapping than enzymatic inhibition. Loss
of the NHEJ factor TP53BP1 has been shown to cause resis-
tance to PARP inhibitors in several models (Bouwman et al.,
2010; Bunting et al., 2010; Chapman et al., 2012). This was
also reflected in the chemical-genetic map, with TP53BP1
knockdown conferring resistance to PARP inhibitors (BMN673
S = 3.3) and DNA cross-linkers (cisplatin S = 4.3) (Figures 1D
and 1E). We conclude that the chemical-genetic interaction

 map recapitulates known drivers of chemosensitivity and resis-
tance in a quantitative fashion and is a resource for the identifica-
tion of potential drivers of the drug response.
Chemical-Genetic Profiles Link Drugs with Similar
Mechanisms of Action
While broad classes of chemotherapeutics target various as-
pects of DNA processing and repair, their exact mechanisms
of action are often unclear (Cheung-Ong et al., 2013). Therefore,
we asked whether the map could be used to link together drugs
based on common mechanisms of action. For a given drug, its
profile of chemical interaction scores represents a high-resolu-
tion phenotype that can be compared to other drugs. Calculating
all-pairwise correlations between drugs revealed that drugs
known to operate in the same general class had a higher average
correlation of profiles as compared to drugs that were unrelated
(Figure 1F, p = 4e�11). Overall, this trend was highest for topo-
isomerase and PARP inhibitors, as well as DNA cross-linkers,
which were all significantly more inter-related compared to
background (Figure 1F). For topoisomerase inhibitors, their pro-
files were highly correlated (mean r = 0.45, p = 4e�15) and
exemplified by the shared profiles of topoisomerase II inhibitors,
etoposide and doxorubicin (r = 0.65, p = 5e�79). The ability to
link drugs with similar mechanisms of action led us to further
investigate the mechanism of action of PARP inhibitors. We
found a strong correlation of profiles comparing PARP inhibitors
with cisplatin and mitomycin C that both work by causing
intra-strand crosslinks that block replication (mean r = 0.35,
p = 6.9e�7). However, this correlation was highly related to
PARP-trapping ability, with the most potent trapper, BMN673,
having the highest correlation with cisplatin (r = 0.51) and mito-
mycin C (r = 0.49) (Figure 1G). Taken together, our results further
support the model whereby PARP trapping creates double-
strand breaks during replication in a manner similar to that of
cisplatin and mitomycin C and that HR is necessary to repair
these lesions. Therefore, the genetic interaction map provides
a high-resolution means to understand similarities and differ-
ences between the mechanisms of action of drugs.

 Prediction of Cancer Cell Line Responses Using the
Chemical-Genetic Interaction Map
Based on the similarity of profiles between related drugs, we
next sought to combine genetic interactions based on drug class
to identify a consensus chemical-genetic interaction map. In this
consensus map, a connection between a gene and a compound
category reflects a concordance of response across multiple
related drugs and compared against a randomly permuted back-
ground. At an FDR of 0.1% we identified 125 connections be-
tween genes and different drug classes (Figure 2A; Table S3).
While connections spanned all major drug classes, topoisomer-
ase inhibitors, PARP inhibitors, and alkylating agents made up
the majority of this network, while microtubule inhibitors were un-
der-represented due to the lack of genetic interactions in com-
mon across this class of agents (Figures S1C and S1D). Through
the analysis of independent chemical entities sharing a common
mechanism, this map highlights many potential modifiers of drug
responses that are altered in breast and ovarian cancers that
may participate in the DNA-damage response.
The ability of the chemical-genetic interaction map to
identify causal genetic relationships also raises the possibility
that a quantitative map could complement pharmacogenomics

 efforts using large panels of cancer cell lines (Barretina et al.,
2012; Basu et al., 2013; Garnett et al., 2012). While previous
studies have used supervised machine-learning approaches
to identify molecular correlates of drug sensitivity across cell
lines, we hypothesized that the relationships identified by
gene knockdown constitute a more direct and causal readout
of gene function that could enhance biomarker identification.
Comparison of 11 drugs in common between our study and
the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal (CTRP) revealed a
strong degree of overlap between interactions identified in the
chemical-genetic interaction map and genes whose response
was significantly correlated with the drug response (Figure 2B)
(Basu et al., 2013). Furthermore, this degree of overlap was
highly related to the score threshold used with 21.5% of interac-
tions overlapping at a cutoff of 3 (p = 2.9e�3) and nearly 60%
overlapping at a cutoff of 8 (p = 3.1e�5), reflecting the quantita-
tive nature of the dataset (Figure 2B). One example of an inter-
action recapitulated in cell lines was ARID1A and etoposide,
with a score of 8.15. This interaction was observed across
496 cancer cell lines where ARID1A expression was strongly
linked with etoposide sensitivity (r = �0.297, p = 1.5e�11) and
low ARID1A expression was highly predictive of resistance to
etoposide (94.8% precision; Figures S2A and S2B). This inter-
action was present in the majority of the 22 tumor lineages
analyzed and strongest in sarcoma lines (r = �0.9; Figure S2C).
Etoposide impairs replication and causes DNA double-strand
breaks by locking topoisomerase II onto DNA (Pommier et al.,
2010). Since ARID1A facilitates the binding of topoisomerase
II onto DNA (Dykhuizen et al., 2013), ARID1A loss could
contribute to resistance by impairing the cytotoxic effect of
etoposide. Therefore, genetic interaction information comple-
ments cell-line screening efforts and may be used to generate
mechanistic hypotheses that bridge between correlation and
causation.
The significance and quantitative nature of the overlap be-
tween our map and expression-based correlates of drug sensi-
tivity found in cancer cell lines prompted us to explore whether
this map could be used to systematically predict cancer cell
line sensitivity in an unsupervised fashion. For each drug, we
used the relative expression of each of the genes in its network
to derive a drug response prediction for every cell line (Experi-
mental Procedures). We evaluated this method using a sliding
cutoff to define the specific network for each drug and found
that more stringent networks provided increased power to
predict drug sensitivity, with nearly 60%–70% of drugs predicted
accurately at a cutoff between 5 and 6 (Figure 2C). At a cutoff
of 5, predictions were significant for 7 out of the 11 drugs
(Figure 2D). Analysis of the genes that were most informative in
making correct predictions in these cases revealed genes
involved in drug sensitivity and resistance. Knockdown of
EIF4A1 caused resistance to methotrexate (S = 6.5), and in cell
lines, EIF4A1 expression is positively correlated with metho-
trexate sensitivity across 645 cell lines (r = 0.25, p = 1.9e�8),
consistent with the network prediction. Alternatively, SNX24
knockdown was synthetic lethal with paclitaxel (S = �6.8), and
SNX24 expression was negatively correlated with drug sensi-
tivity (r = �0.14, p = 0.0026). Thus, computational analysis of
chemical-genetic interaction maps can be used to complement
cancer cell line screens and may be able to produce biomarkers
that bridge correlation with causation.

 Prediction of Drug Synergies Using the Chemical-
Genetic Interaction Map
There has been considerable interest in the development of tar-
geted therapies that inhibit DNA-repair machinery to be used in
combination with agents that generate specific types of DNA
damage (Gavande et al., 2016). We observed that loss of the
DNA-damage signaling kinase ATR induced sensitivity to cross-
linking agents and inhibitors of DNA replication in the consensus
map (Figure 2A). This was in contrast to its closely related
paralog kinase ATM, which was not linked to the response to
these drugs (Figure 2A). We hypothesized that the synthetic
lethal interactions observed with ATR knockdown could be phe-
nocopied with a small-molecule inhibitor of ATR and used to pri-
oritize synergistic drug combinations. We tested the combined
effects of the ATR inhibitor VE-821 with five drugs that were syn-
thetic lethal with ATR knockdown and three drugs that were not
(Figure 3A). Using a matrix screening approach, we measured
the effects of each drug on proliferation and determined a

control.

 synergy score reflecting the degree of drug synergy based on the
Loewe excess model (Leha
´ r et al., 2009). Drugs that were syn-
thetic lethal with ATR inhibition were more synergistic than those
that were not predicted to be (p = 0.048, Figure 3B). In particular,
we found that the addition of VE-821 could sensitize MCF10A
cells to cisplatin (ATR, S = �7.7) and BMN673 (ATR, S = �5.0)
(Figure 3C), with a combination index (CI) that was below 1 for
most dose combinations, indicative of true synergy (Figure 3D)
(Chou, 2010). Analysis at doses where synergy was apparent re-
vealed that the combination had a greater than additive impact
on growth inhibition (Figure 3E). We also identified other drug-
gable nodes in the chemical-genetic interaction map and tested
whether resulting combinations had evidence of drug synergy.
The map identified an interaction between the loss of the base
excision repair protein APEX1 and PARP inhibition that was the
lowest with BMN673 (S = �3.9) (Figure 2A). We tested for poten-
tial synergy between BMN673 and a small-molecule inhibitor of
APEX1, CRT0044876 (Madhusudan et al., 2005). CRT0044876
displayed a dose-dependent ability to sensitize MCF10A cells
to BMN673 (Figure 3C) and showed evidence of synergy via CI
calculation as well as a greater than additive response (Figures
3D and 3E). Therefore, the chemical-genetic interaction map
can be used to prioritize drug combinations, which may increase
the efficacy of chemotherapeutics.
Prediction of Factors Mediating Resistance to PARP
Inhibition
We next evaluated the map as a systematic resource to predict
molecules involved in DNA repair and associated mechanisms of
resistance to chemotherapy. We focused on PARP inhibitors
olaparib, veliparib, rucaparib, and BMN673, as well as cisplatin,
since this class was highly covered in the map, has similar mech-
anisms of action, and generates DNA damage that depends on
repair via HR (Figure 1E). As controls, BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2,
and SHFM1 knockdown was synthetic lethal with these agents,
and loss of TP53BP1 was associated with resistance (Figure 4A).
An important consideration in interpreting genetic interaction
data from a single cell line is the degree to which such interac-
tions are maintained in other cellular contexts (Ashworth et al.,
2011). To assess whether interactions were maintained, we iden-
tified chemical-genetic interactions using the same experimental
approach with BMN673 in a total of 7 additional lines, including
four breast cancer lines and three ovarian cancer lines. After
scoring esiRNAs for their ability to induce resistance or sensi-
tivity to BMN673 in each of these lines (defined based on a cutoff
of p < 0.01), we found that the chemical-genetic interaction score
was highly predictive of whether a particular interaction was pre-
served in other cell lines (Table S4). For example, interactions
with BMN673 that had a score >5 in MCF10A cells were 40%
likely to be validated in 4 or more cell lines (half of all 8 lines
tested) and 70% likely to be validated in at least 2 other lines (Fig-
ure 4B). This trend was also evident for negative interactions,
where an S score < �4 had a 40% chance of being scored as
a synthetic lethal in half the cell lines tested. We note that no
interaction was scored as synthetic lethal in all cell lines. Since
two of the tested lines were BRCA1 mutant (SUM149PT,
UWB1.289), a likely reason for this is that factors whose loss
leads to PARP sensitivity in HR-competent MCF10A cells may
not be relevant in BRCA1 mutant cells that are already HR defi-
cient. Therefore, these data suggest that interaction strength in
MCF10A cells can be used to predict genetic interactions in
other cell lines, highlighting the quantitative nature of this map.
We next sought to validate the top two hits producing resis-
tance, GPBP1 and ARID1A, in additional models. Using indepen-
dent siRNAs, we confirmed that loss of either factor caused
resistance to BMN673 in MCF10A, MDAMB231, SUM149PT,
and UWB1.289 cells at levels comparable to that for loss of
TP53BP1 as a positive control for PARP inhibitor resistance (Fig-
ure 4C). ARID1A loss often occurs through somatic mutation
andhasbeenpreviouslylinkedtotheregulationofDNA-repairpro-
cesses (Dykhuizen et al., 2013; Shen et al., 2015). We confirmed
this result in engineered ARID1A�/� MCF10A cells, which were
resistant to BMN673 in comparison to parental MCF10A cells (Fig-
ures S3A and S3B). We next searched for clinical evidence that
ARID1A loss contributes to resistance to PARP or platinum-con-
taining chemotherapy. In support, we found that ARID1A loss
was linked to poor outcome in TCGA high-grade serous ovarian
cancers (TCGA HGSOCs) receiving platinum as the standard of
care (p = 0.01; Figure 5A; Table S5) (Cancer Genome Atlas

 Research Network, 2011). To test whether this observation
extended to PARP inhibitors, we analyzed samples from HGSOC
patients treated with rucaparib in a phase II clinical trial
(ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT01891344) (Swisher et al., 2017).
We did not identify any patients with concurrent BRCA1 and
ARID1A mutations and, therefore, focused our analysis on a
cohort of 154 patients without mutations in HR pathway genes
and identified 10 that had mutations in ARID1A. The progres-
sion-free survival (PFS) for these 10 ARID1A mutant cases was
significantly lower than for the rest of this cohort (p = 0.003;
Figure 5B). All ARID1A mutant cases were HGSOCs, confirmed
by histological analysis (Table S5). These clinical data show that
PARP inhibitors provide no clinical benefit in ARID1A-mutated,
high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian cancer and warrants
further investigation.
GPBP1 Loss Causes PARP and Platinum Resistance by
Regulating the Expression of Factors Involved in HR
We next investigated the top candidate in our categorical
analysis, GPBP1, a transcription factor of unknown function.
GPBP1 lies on chromosome 5q11, a region focally deleted in
approximately 5% of TCGA HGSOCs and 4% of TCGA
breast cancers. To determine whether GPBP1 plays a role in
the transcriptional response to DNA damage, we performed
RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of control and GPBP1-
knockdown MCF10A cells treated with or without BMN673.
qRT-PCR of GPBP1-knockdown cells confirmed 90% knock-
down at the mRNA level in this experiment (Figure S4A). In
response to 24-hr BMN673 treatment, GPBP1 knockdown
caused the upregulation of factors involved in HR based
on gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al.,
2005) (Figure 6A), indicating a potential compensatory mecha-
nism to facilitate repair of lesions incurred by PARP inhibition.
In contrast to control cells, GPBP1 knockdown resulted in the
upregulation of distinct and canonical HR factors such as
BRCA1 and RAD51B in response to BMN673 (Figure 6B).
We next asked whethr this transcriptional response was suffi-
cient to enhance the repair of double-strand breaks incurred by
PARP inhibition and whether this occurred via HR. This hypoth-
esis was particularly intriguing, since GPBP1 knockdown caused
resistance to BMN673 in BRCA1 mutant cancer cell lines, sug-
gesting that GPBP1 loss may bypass the requirement of
BRCA1 for HR (Figure 4C). To test this hypothesis, we estab-
lished an HR-deficient and PARP-inhibitor-sensitive MCF10A
model by BRCA1 knockdown, and in this model, knockdown
of BRCA1 and GPBP1 together led to a significant rescue of
BMN673 sensitivity (Figure S4B). Using immunofluorescence,
we found that generation of gH2AX foci after BMN673 treatment
was reduced in BRCA1+GPBP1 versus BRCA1 knockdown cells
(p = 0.045), indicating that GPBP1 loss led to a reduction in the
number of DNA double-strand breaks formed after PARP inhib-
itor treatment (Figure 6C). To determine whether this reduction in
double-strand breaks was due to heightened HR repair capacity,
we examined the recruitment of the strand-exchange protein
RAD51 to damaged chromatin, a mark of commitment to dou-
ble-strand break repair using HR. We found that the recruitment
of RAD51 was increased in BRCA1+GPBP1 versus BRCA1
knockdown cells after PARP inhibition, indicating that GPBP1
loss led to an increase in double-strand break repair through
HR (p = 0.036; Figure 6D). We confirmed these findings in

 BRCA1 mutant SUM149PT cells, where GPBP1 knockdown also
led to a significant reduction in H2AX foci and increase in RAD51
foci after BMN673 treatment (Figures 6E and 6F), indicating that
GPBP1 loss can also restore HR in cases when BRCA1 is
mutated. These results indicate that GPBP1 loss contributes to
increased double-strand break repair by HR as a mechanism
of PARP inhibitor resistance.
Drawing from our RNA-seq analysis, we next asked whether
the expression of HR factors was also elevated in human cancer
samples harboring GPBP1 loss and whether it might contribute
to drug resistance. There was a strong concordance between
genes upregulated upon GPBP1 knockdown and genes whose
expression level was higher in breast cancers with GPBP1 loss
(Figure 7A). Further analysis of samples with GPBP1 loss in
TCGA ovarian cancer samples also reflected the increased
expression of a number of the same HR factors, indicating a
similar function of GPBP1 in these two disease types (Figure 7B).
We next asked whether this enhancement in HR gene expres-
sion upon GPBP1 loss resulted in drug resistance in ovarian can-
cer patients treated with platinum-containing therapy. In the
TCGA ovarian cohort, survival analysis indicated that GPBP1
loss was associated with poor outcome and resistance to plat-
inum therapy (p = 0.001, via log-rank test; Figure 7C). Therefore,
GPBP1 loss contributes to platinum resistance in ovarian cancer
through the increased expression of genes involved in HR.
DISCUSSION
We present a quantitative map to link the efficacy of chemother-
apeutics to tumor genetics that can serve as a platform for the
functional and therapeutic translation of tumor genomes. In
contrast to most standard genetic screens, this approach pro-
vides a quantitative readout that approximates genetic interac-
tion strength and allows for the comparison of responses across
many drugs. This map is able to recapture many known synthetic
lethal interactions, and future work may expand on this map
beyond the set of genes screened here, as well as using comple-
mentary technologies such as CRISPR/Cas9 to evaluate the
impact of gene knockout versus knockdown as well as gene acti-
vation. To aid in integration of these data with ongoing efforts to
systematize cancer-related screens, data from this network have
been deposited into the Cancer Target Discovery and Develop-
ment (CTD2) Dashboard (https://ctd2-dashboard.nci.nih.gov/).
Using insights derived from the chemical-genetic interaction
map, we highlight several vignettes describing how it can be
used to aid in the development of cancer therapeutics. The
map was able to identify drugs with similar mechanisms of action
and highlights the mechanistic commonalities between PARP in-
hibitors and DNA cross-linking agents that contribute to syn-
thetic lethality with loss of HR pathway genes. The map identified
interactions that could be recapitulated with small-molecule in-
hibitors of ATR and APEX1, revealing synergistic drug combina-
tions. As a means to highlight the quantitative nature of this
resource for more systematic discovery, we show that computa-
tional analysis of this map can be used to predict the sensitivity of
tumor cells to chemotherapies. As many large-scale efforts to
screen cancer-cell-line panels with small molecules are ongoing
(Barretina et al., 2012; Basu et al., 2013; Garnett et al., 2012), our
analysis suggests that loss of many of the factors identified in
this map is linked with drug sensitivity in a predictive way. Since
current approaches do not use this functional information, the
map may provide a platform for enhancing methods to predict
drug responses from baseline genomic profiles by bridging cor-
relation with causation (Costello et al., 2014). Future computa-
tional approaches to integrate cell-line screen with chemical-ge-
netic interaction maps could aid in these more established drug
and biomarker development approaches.
We demonstrate several ways to enhance the reliability and
utility of this map. First, we show that related drugs have similar
genetic interaction profiles and that this property can be used to

 identify modifiers of therapeutic responses that are not specific
to a single compound. As specific drugs may have unique off-
targets, such as the case for PARP inhibitors (Knezevic et al.,
2016), analyzing related drugs together may identify genetic in-
teractions linked to their core mechanism of action. Second,
the plasticity in genetic networks has been an impediment to
the identification of genetic interactions that are cell type
independent (i.e., ‘‘hard’’ versus ‘‘soft’’ interactions) (Ashworth
et al., 2011). Rescreening in multiple cancer cell lines showed
that the strength of genetic interaction was proportional to the
likelihood of interaction being conserved in other cell lines.
Therefore our data indicate that the quantitative nature of genetic
interaction maps could be used to distinguish between interac-
tions that are more globally preserved versus those more spe-
cific to the cell line tested.
Based on our categorical analysis, we identified that ARID1A
and GPBP1 loss causes PARP inhibitor resistance. Low
ARID1A expression has been linked with poor outcome and
platinum resistance in HGSOC (Yokoyama et al., 2014) and
clear-cell ovarian cancers (Itamochi et al., 2015; Katagiri
et al., 2012). However, the functional role of ARID1A on DNA
repair is unclear, with conflicting reports of its role in HR (Adam-
son et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2015). Together, these data warrant
a more complete interrogation of the role of ARID1A on PARP
inhibitor resistance. The strongest resistance interaction with
PARP inhibitors and cisplatin was GPBP1, which, as we
show, is involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes
involved in HR. Another transcriptional regulator, CDK12, has
been shown to modulate PARP inhibitor sensitivity in a similar
manner (Bajrami et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2016). Future
studies may seek to identify the potential interplay between
the targets of CDK12 and GPBP1. Since we observed that
GPBP1 loss is also linked to chemoresistance and poor clinical
outcome, these data warrant a more complete interrogation of
the function and role of GPBP1. Because GPBP1 loss was not
assayed in our rucaparib clinical trial cohort, future work could
determine its clinical association with PARP inhibitor resis-
tance. This work highlights the utility of a systematic chemi-
cal-genetic interaction map as a resource for the identification
of clinically relevant biomarkers of drug susceptibility, as well
as a foundation for integration with other cancer datasets to
enhance drug and biomarker development.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Cell Culture
MCF10A cells were maintained in DMEM/F12 medium supplemented with 5%
horse serum, epidermal growth factor (20 ng/mL), insulin (10 mg/mL), hydro-
cortisone (0.5 mg/mL), cholera toxin (100 ng/mL), and penicillin/streptomycin.
All cell lines were obtained from the ATCC and cultured according to listed
protocols, except for ARID1A�/� MCF10A cells, which were obtained from
Horizon Discovery (Cambridge, UK) and maintained in the MCF10A media
described earlier. Rucaparib was provided by Clovis Oncology; other drugs
were purchased from Selleckchem.
Measurement of Chemical-Genetic Interactions
MCF10A cells were reverse transfected in 384-well plates (1,000 cells per well)
using 5 ng of esiRNA (Sigma) with RNAiMax (0.05 mL per well) as a transfection
reagent in quadruplicate. Cells were transfected for 24 hr, and then the entire
plate was treated with one drug at a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
concentration or DMSO for 72 hr, after which cells were stained with Hoescht
33342 and counted using a Thermo CellInsight high-content microscope.
After drug or DMSO treatment, each plate was median centered to 2,000
cells per well to normalize relative proliferation rates. Plates had a minimum in-
ternal correlation across the 4 replicate wells of 0.7. Each well in the drug-
treated plate was then compared to the same well in the DMSO-treated plate.
We observed an overall linear relationship between drug and DMSO plates,
indicating that most esiRNAs have no effect on drug sensitivity. Next, the set
of 4 normalized replicate values in the DMSO plate was compared to the
same in the drug plate, and both the fold change in cell number and the p value
of significance of this difference in medians were calculated using a modified t
test. The S score of genetic interaction is defined by the negative log10 of the t
test p value and signed with either positive (gene loss drives resistance to drug)
or negative (gene loss drives sensitivity to drug) values. FDR was calculated
based on the percentage of negative-control knockdowns (GFP) whose score
exceeded a given threshold. The described protocol is available in MATLAB,
and code and raw data to recreate the dataset are available at https://
