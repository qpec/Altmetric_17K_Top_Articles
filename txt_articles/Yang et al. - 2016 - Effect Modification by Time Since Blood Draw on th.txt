Abstract
A recent meta-analysis suggested that circulating fatty acids do not play an important role in prostate carcinogenesis. We hy-
pothesized that the relation between circulating fatty acids and prostate cancer (PCa) risk is modified by time between blood
draw and diagnosis. We tested this hypothesis in a prospective case-control study of 476 PCa cases and matched control sub-
jects nested in the Physicians’ Health Study. The previously reported associations between fatty acids and PCa in this cohort
were dramatically stronger among men diagnosed 10 or more years after blood collection. Statistically significant effect modi-
fication by time since blood collection was identified for mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated fatty acids and was more
pronounced for aggressive tumors. Among men diagnosed fewer than 10 years since blood collection, the relative risks per
interquartile range were 1.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] ¼ 0.86 to 1.25) for total mono-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and
0.95 (95% CI ¼ 0.78 to 1.15) for total poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) whereas among men diagnosed 10 or more years after
blood draw the relative risks per interquartile range were 1.69 (95% CI ¼ 1.21 to 2.34) for MUFA (Pheterogeneity ¼ .01) and 0.59
(95% CI ¼ 0.42 to 0.83) for PUFA (Pheterogeneity ¼ .02). These data suggest that the results of the meta-analysis may be partly ex-
plained by insufficient follow-up time. Furthermore, they suggest that some environmental and metabolic factors may play a
role in prostate carcinogenesis decades before clinical identification of this disease.
The literature on the relation between circulating fatty acid
(FA) levels and prostate cancer (PCa) risk has been inconsistent
(1–12). For example, mono-unsaturated fatty acid levels have
been related to higher risk of PCa in some studies (1,11) but not
in others (3,6,7). A recent meta-analysis that pooled individual-
level data from seven prospective biomarker studies, including
the Physicians’ Health Study (PHS) (4,5,11), did not find evidence
for strong associations between circulating FAs and PCa risk
(13). While compelling at face value, some of the limitations
of this pooled analysis may explain its results. Chief among
these
are
the
relatively
short
follow-up
time
and
the
underrepresentation of clinically aggressive disease, possibly
resulting from most studies having enrolled patients after PSA
screening became widespread. The average time between blood
draw and PCa diagnosis was five years in the pooled analysis,
compared with nine years in the PHS. Also, the proportion of ag-
gressive PCa cases (defined in terms of stage and lethality) in
the pooled analysis was 9%, as compared with 20% in PHS. This
reflects in part the proportion of cases diagnosed after 1995,
which was 86% in the pooled analysis vs 15% in PHS. Given that
increasing evidence suggests that exposures taking place de-
cades before disease identification may be more relevant in

 prostate carcinogenesis than more proximal exposures (14), we
hypothesized that the previously reported associations between
blood fatty acids and PCa in the PHS would become stronger
with increasing follow-up time. We also evaluated whether this
hypothesized interaction would
differ according to tumor
characteristics.
The study design has been previously described (4,5,11).
Briefly, PHS was a randomized trial of aspirin and b-carotene
among 22 071 US men age 40 to 84 years in 1982. Written in-
formed consent was obtained, and the institutional review
boards of Partners HealthCare and the Harvard T. H. Chan School
of Public Health approved this study. When PCa was reported in
annual follow-up questionnaires, medical records and pathology
reports were obtained and reviewed by study physicians to con-
firm diagnosis and obtain clinical information, including tumor
stage, grade, and prostate-specific antigen at diagnosis. Baseline
blood specimens were obtained before random assignment and
stored at -82 �C (15).Whole blood FA levels were determined for
476 men diagnosed with PCa over 13 years of follow-up and
matched to 476 control subjects by age and smoking status at
baseline (4,5,11). The FA levels in each sample were measured by
gas-liquid chromatography and expressed as the percentages of
total FAs. Long-term storage does not have a major impact on
measurement of FA levels (16). Logistic regression models condi-
tioned on the matching variables were used to estimate the rela-
tive risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PCa per one
interquartile range (IQR) increase and across quintiles of FA levels
stratified by time between blood draw and PCa diagnosis (<5
years vs � 5 years, <10 years vs �10 years, and continuous yearly
exclusion, ie, �1, �2. . .). We also fitted these models in subgroups
defined by tumor characteristics (stage, grade, lethality—metas-
tasis or death vs not—and aggressiveness, defined as clinical
stage T3/T4/M1 or Gleason score � 8 at diagnosis or subsequent
metastasis or death). Heterogeneity tests to compare risks of two
time intervals were performed by including a product term of
time intervals (dichotomous) and FA levels (continuous). All sta-
tistical analyses were carried out by SAS, version 9.3 (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). Results were considered to be statistically sig-
nificant when P values were less than .05 (two-sided).
The median follow-up time was nine years (25th–75th per-
centile ¼ 7–11 years). The previously reported associations of
mono-unsaturated (MUFA) (11) and poly-unsaturated (PUFA) (4)
FAs with PCa risk were stronger among men diagnosed 10 or
more years after blood draw than among men diagnosed earlier
(Table 1). Among men diagnosed fewer than 10 years since
blood collection, the relative risks per IQR were 1.03 (95%
CI ¼ 0.86 to 1.25) for total MUFA and 0.95 (95% CI ¼ 0.78 to 1.15)
for total PUFA; among men diagnosed 10 or more years after
blood draw, the relative risks per IQR were 1.69 (95% CI ¼ 1.21 to
2.34) for MUFA (Pheterogeneity ¼ .01) and 0.59 (95% CI ¼ 0.42 to 0.83)
for PUFA (Pheterogeneity ¼ .02). A similar pattern was observed
when follow-up time was dichotomized at five years (data not
shown). Finer stratification of follow-up time showed progres-
sively stronger associations, particularly for aggressive tumors

 (Figure 1). Among men diagnosed with aggressive PCa, as the
time between blood draw and diagnosis increased by year, the
relative risks per IQR increased for MUFA from 1.05 (95%
CI ¼ 0.80 to 1.38) of all aggressive cases to 2.59 (95% CI ¼ 1.08 to
6.24) of cases diagnosed 10 or more years since blood draw and
decreased for PUFA from 0.91 (95% CI ¼ 0.68 to 1.21) of all aggres-
sive cases to 0.28 (95% CI ¼ 0.09 to 0.83) of cases diagnosed 10
years after blood collection. This pattern was more evident
when fatty acids were modeled as quintiles (Supplementary
Figure 1, available online).
These findings are in agreement with our hypothesis that
nutritional and metabolic factors captured by circulating FA lev-
els play a role in prostate carcinogenesis in its early stages and
with the more general hypothesis that exposures taking place
decades before any clinical evidence of disease may be particu-
larly important for the development of PCa (14). If our hypothe-
sis is true, it could explain why studies with longer follow-up
time (time between blood draw and PCa diagnosis), a greater
proportion of advanced/high-grade cases, and fewer cases iden-
tified after PSA screening became widespread tend to report
strong associations between circulating FAs and PCa risk (1,11)
whereas studies with shorter follow-up and more localized/low-
grade cases tend to report either no association and associa-
tions with PCa in the opposite direction (6,8,10).
Our findings also raise important considerations regarding
the design of epidemiologic studies aimed at identifying risk
factors for PCa. If, as suggested by our data, exposures predating
PCa diagnosis by decades are more relevant to the development
of this disease than more proximal exposures, epidemiologic
studies focused on older men, as well as epidemiologic studies
with short follow-up, may have limited value in identifying
modifiable risk factors for PCa, particularly the factors playing a
role in the initiation of the carcinogenic process and for factors
subject to important within-subject variability over extended
periods of time such as circulating fatty acids (17). Moreover,
this type of study may be more likely to identify spurious asso-
ciations (eg, associations because of reverse causality) or to fail
to identify associations at all by missing relevant susceptibility
windows.
The most important limitation of the study is the possibility
of residual confounding. Nevertheless, we have previously
shown (4,5,11) that adjustment for a large number of poten-
tial confounders has no to minimal impact on the relation be-
tween fatty acids and prostate cancer risk in this cohort.
The most salient strength of the study is the large number of
cases and long follow-up period since blood draw, which al-
lowed for testing our hypothesis with adequate statistical
power.
In summary, we found that previously reported associations
between circulating FAs and PCa risk in the PHS varied by
follow-up time. Specifically, these associations became stronger
with increasing follow-up time, particularly for aggressive tu-
mors. Our results offer a possible explanation for the inconsis-
tencies across studies addressing these relations and for the
findings of a recent pooled analysis of prospective studies.
Furthermore, they highlight the importance of long follow-up
(>10 years) in epidemiologic studies aimed at identifying risk
factors for PCa, including biomarker-based studies.
