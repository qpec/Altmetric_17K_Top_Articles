IMPORTANCE Despite suggestions of potential harm from unnecessary oxygen therapy,
critically ill patients spend substantial periods in a hyperoxemic state. A strategy of controlled
arterial oxygenation is thus rational but has not been validated in clinical practice.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether a conservative protocol for oxygen supplementation could
improve outcomes in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS Oxygen-ICU was a single-center, open-label, randomized
clinical trial conducted from March 2010 to October 2012 that included all adults admitted
with an expected length of stay of 72 hours or longer to the medical-surgical ICU of Modena
University Hospital, Italy. The originally planned sample size was 660 patients, but the study
was stopped early due to difficulties in enrollment after inclusion of 480 patients.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomly assigned to receive oxygen therapy to maintain
PaO2 between 70 and 100 mm Hg or arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2) between 94%
and 98% (conservative group) or, according to standard ICU practice, to allow PaO2 values up
to 150 mm Hg or SpO2 values between 97% and 100% (conventional control group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES TheprimaryoutcomewasICUmortality.Secondaryoutcomes

RESULTS A total of 434 patients (median age, 64 years; 188 [43.3%] women) received
conventional (n = 218) or conservative (n = 216) oxygen therapy and were included in the
modified intent-to-treat analysis. Daily time-weighted PaO2 averages during the ICU stay were
significantly higher (P < .001) in the conventional group (median PaO2, 102 mm Hg [IQR,
88-116]) vs the conservative group (median PaO2, 87 mm Hg [IQR, 79-97]). Mortality was
lower in the conservative oxygen therapy group. The conservative group had fewer episodes
of shock, liver failure, and bacteremia.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among critically ill patients with an ICU length of stay of 72
hours or longer, a conservative protocol for oxygen therapy vs conventional therapy resulted in
lower ICU mortality. These preliminary findings were based on unplanned early termination of
the trial, and a larger multicenter trial is needed to evaluate the potential benefit of this approach.

A
cute hypoxemia frequently occurs in hospitalized pa-
tients and is generally counteracted by supplementa-
tion of oxygen in inspired gas. Although this strategy
is consistently endorsed by guidelines for the management of
critically ill patients, explicit target values for PaO2 or arterial
oxyhemoglobin saturations (SaO2) are not provided.1-3
A lack of attentive oxygen management may expose pa-
tients unnecessarily to hyperoxia, leading to potential iatro-
genic harm. In humans, direct lung toxicity is perhaps the
best-known harmful consequence of hyperoxia with intersti-
tial fibrosis, atelectasis, and tracheobronchitis.4,5 Systemi-
cally, hyperoxia induces peripheral vasoconstriction6 and,
in animal models, increases production of reactive oxygen
species.7 The PROXI trial (Perioperative Oxygen Fraction–
Effect on Surgical Site Infection and Pulmonary Complica-
tions After Abdominal Surgery) reported an association be-
tween perioperative administration of a high fraction of
inspired oxygen (FiO2) and an increase in long-term mortality.8
Similarly, the recent AVOID trial (Air Versus Oxygen in
Myocardial Infarction) showed that in patients with ST-
segment elevation myocardial infarction but without hy-
poxia, supplemental oxygen therapy may increase early myo-
cardial injury and is associated with larger myocardial infarct
sizeat6months.9Clinicaluncertaintystillsurroundsthesafety
and benefit of hyperoxia after cerebral ischemia, out-of-
hospital cardiac arrest, and cardiac surgery.10-12
Despite these numerous suggestions of potential harm
from hyperoxia, both treatment guidelines and standard cli-
nician behavior promote prompt, uncontrolled administra-
tion of high-flow, high-concentration oxygen therapy to sick
patients, with supranormal values of PaO2 being frequently
achieved.13 Recent observational studies highlight that inten-
sive care unit (ICU) patients are often managed with an ex-
cess of FiO2 and are hyperoxemic for substantial periods.14,15
Although a controlled arterial oxygenation strategy ap-
pearsrational,3ithastobevalidatedinclinicalpracticeinterms
of safety, efficacy, and applicability. The aim of our random-
ized clinical study was to determine whether the application
of a strict conservative protocol for oxygen supplementation
to maintain PaO2 within physiologic limits could improve out-
comes in critically ill ICU patients.
Methods
Study Design and Patients
Oxygen-ICU was a single-center, open-label, 2-parallel-
group, randomized clinical trial performed in the medical-
surgicalICUofModenaUniversityHospital.Theprotocol(avail-
able in Supplement 1) and consent forms had been previously
approved by the hospital ethics committee. Written in-
formed consent or deferred consent was obtained from each
patient or his/her legal surrogate.
From March 1, 2010, through October 30, 2012, all pa-
tients aged 18 years or older and admitted to the ICU with an
expected length of stay of 72 hours or longer were considered
for inclusion. Exclusion criteria included age younger than
18 years, pregnancy, ICU readmission, a decision to withhold
life-sustaining treatment, immunosuppression or neutrope-
nia, and enrollment in another study. Because of a different
protocol for oxygen supplementation, patients with acute de-
compensation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
acute respiratory distress syndrome with a PaO2:FiO2 ratio less
than 150 were also excluded.
Randomization and Study Treatment
On admission, enrolled patients were randomized by a com-
puterized random-number generator in a 1:1 ratio into control
(conventional) and protocol (conservative) groups. The ran-
domization sequence was concealed from the researchers by
use of sequentially numbered, closed, opaque envelopes that
were opened after patient study inclusion. In the control
group, oxygen therapy was administered according to stan-
dard ICU practice, in which each patient received an FiO2 of at
least 0.4, allowing PaO2 values up to 150 mm Hg and an SpO2
between 97% and 100%. If the SpO2 decreased below 95% to
97%, the FiO2 was increased to reach the target value of SpO2.
In the protocol group, oxygen therapy was administered at
the lowest possible FiO2 to maintain the PaO2 between 70 and
100 mm Hg or SpO2 values between 94% and 98%. Altera-
tions in FiO2 were completed according to a nurse order set.
In particular, the FiO2 was gradually reduced or oxygen
supplementation discontinued whenever the PaO2 or SpO2
exceeded 100 mm Hg or 98%, respectively. Consistent with
our standard ICU practice, control patients received an FiO2
of 1.0 during intubation, airway suction, or hospital transfer.
In protocol patients, supplemental oxygen was administered
only if SpO2 decreased below 94%. Decisions about noninva-
sive ventilation, intubation or extubation, and ventilator set-
tings were dictated by common clinical criteria. In both
groups, arterial blood gas analyses and other laboratory tests
were conducted and radiology and microbiological samples
were taken according to clinical need. At least 1 arterial blood
gas sample was collected per day for each patient.
If adverse events occurred, the physician in charge could
withdraw the patient from the study. All other treatment de-
cisions were left to the discretion of the attending physician.
Key Points
Question Among critically ill patients, is a conservative
oxygenation strategy aimed to maintain arterial saturation within
physiologic limits more beneficial than a conventional strategy?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 480
patients with an expected intensive care unit length of stay of 72
hours or longer, a conservative protocol for oxygen
supplementation was associated with an absolute risk reduction
for intensive care unit mortality of 8.6% compared with that for
patients treated with conventional therapy. However, the trial was
terminated early because of difficulty with patient enrollment.
Meaning Among critically ill intensive care unit patients with a
length of stay of 72 hours or longer, a conservative protocol for
oxygen therapy may be beneficial; however, because the trial was
terminated early, these findings must be considered preliminary.

Data Collection
Anelectroniccasereportformwasusedtocollectdata.Atstudy
inclusion, this included demographic data, type of patient
(medical or surgical), comorbidities, severity of illness as mea-
sured by the Simplified Acute Physiology Score–II,16 docu-
mented infections, and respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, and
liver failure, defined as a Sequential Organ Failure Assess-
ment(SOFA)scoreof3ormoreforthecorrespondingorgan.17-19
The time-weighted average FiO2 and PaO2 were recorded
daily until patient death or ICU discharge, as were the use of
mechanical ventilation, vasoactive drugs, and renal replace-
ment therapy; urine output; plasma creatinine and bilirubin
concentrations; and any evidence of new infection. The daily
FiO2 and PaO2 time-weighted averages were calculated as the
mean value of 2 consecutive measurements multiplied by the
time (hours) between the measurements and divided by 24
hours. If only 1 value was available within a 24-hour period,
the PaO2 time-weighted average was equal to that value. Pa-
tients with less than 1 arterial blood gas analysis per day were
excluded from analysis (see below).
Study Outcomes
The primary outcome was ICU mortality. Secondary out-
comes included new-onset respiratory, cardiovascular, liver,
and renal failure (defined as a SOFA score ≥3 for the corre-
sponding organ) occurring 48 hours or more after ICU
admission17-19; need for reoperation in surgical patients; and
bloodstream, respiratory, and surgical site infections (de-
fined according to Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion definitions20). Only microbiologically documented blood-
stream and respiratory tract infections were considered.
Hospital mortality and ventilation-free hours during the ICU
stay were also included as secondary outcomes that were not
prespecified.
Statistical Analysis
On the basis of previous data from our institution that showed
an ICU mortality of 23% in patients staying longer than 3 days,
the originally planned sample size included 660 patients dur-
ing a 2-year period to detect an absolute difference in mortal-
ity of 6% between the protocol and control groups (2-sided
α=.05; power, 80%). We decided to stop the study after 32
months (480 patients), as suggested by our statistical re-
viewer and by the ethics committee after an interim analysis
not defined a priori. In May 2012, a violent earthquake (mag-
nitude 5.9) seriously damaged Modena University Hospital,
with temporary evacuation of our ICU and 20% to 25% reduc-
tion of hospital beds (until the end of 2013). This led to a very
low inclusion rate (3-4 patients/mo). At that time, we esti-
mated that for study completion the enrollment should have
been prolonged for a further 18-20 months. Completing this
period of enrollment would have been difficult, leaving the
studyathighriskforbiasrelatedtopossiblechangesinthestan-
dard oxygen therapy management by nurse staff influenced
by the previous study period. Therefore, patient recruitment
was stopped on October 30, 2012, and we performed an un-
planned interim analysis that confirmed the results observed
in the planned interim analysis, with a significant difference
in the primary outcome between the 2 groups of treatment.
Although the rules for stopping the study early were not pre-
specified in the study protocol, the difficulties to patient in-
clusion led us to terminate the study early, with our decision
supported by a statistical reviewer and delegates of the local
ethics committee.
A modified intent-to-treat population, consisting of all
randomized patients with an ICU length of stay of 72 hours or
longer and for whom at least 1 arterial blood gas analysis had
been performed per day, was the primary population for
analysis. However, the primary and secondary outcomes
were also evaluated in the intent-to-treat population, which
included all randomized patients, excluding those who with-
drew consent. Baseline and outcome variables were com-
pared with Mann-Whitney U and χ2 tests. The effect of con-
servative oxygen therapy on the time to death was assessed
using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank test. Patients
discharged alive from the hospital were considered to have
survived. In a post hoc analysis, we assessed the primary out-
come in patients subgrouped by patient characteristics at
study enrollment and their ICU length of stay. The relation-
ship between oxygen exposure and ICU mortality was evalu-
ated according to the quartile distribution of the median
value of the daily ICU time-weighted PaO2 values. Any asso-
ciation between PaO2 quartiles and ICU mortality, occurrence
of new organ failure and infection, and ventilation-free hours
during the ICU stay were assessed by χ2 and Cochrane-
Armitage tests for trend.

dian with interquartile ranges (IQRs), unless otherwise indi-
cated. The primary end point was confirmatory tested at a

Results
Patients
From March 1, 2010, to October 30, 2012, a total of 480 pa-
tients with an expected ICU stay of 72 hours or longer were ran-
domized to conventional (n = 244) or conservative (n = 236)
oxygen therapy groups. Forty-six patients were excluded be-
cause of withdrawal of consent (n = 2), lack of data during their
ICU stay (n = 9), or ICU stay less than 72 hours (n = 35). There-
fore, the modified intent-to-treat population included 218 in
the conventional group and 216 patients in the conservative
group (Figure 1). The median age, type of admission, preex-

In the modified intent-to-treat population, the daily time-
weighted FiO2 and PaO2 averages during ICU stay were higher
in the conventional group (median FiO2, 0.39 [IQR, 0.35-
0.42]; median PaO2, 102 mm Hg [IQR, 88-116]) than in pa-
tients managed conservatively (median FiO2, 0.36 [IQR, 0.30-
0.40]; median PaO2, 87 mm Hg [IQR, 79-97]; P < .001) (eFigure

with a PaO2 value less than 70 mm Hg per patient during the
ICU stay was similar (conventional: median, 1 [IQR, 0-2]; con-
servative: median, 1 [IQR, 0-2]), whereas the number of analy-
ses with a PaO2 value less than 100 mm Hg was significantly
higher in the conventional group compared with the conser-
vative group (median [IQR], 4 [2-7] vs 1 [0-3]); P < .001).
Outcome Data
In the modified intent-to-treat population, 25 patients in the
conservative group (11.6%) died during their ICU stay com-
pared with 44 who died in the conventional group (20.2%)
(absolute risk reduction, 0.086 [95% CI, 0.017-0.150]; rela-
tive risk, 0.57 [95% CI, 0.37-0.90]; P = .01). Hospital mortal-
ity, not a prespecified outcome, was also lower in the conser-
vative oxygen strategy group (24.2% vs 33.9%; absolute risk
reduction, 0.099 [95% CI, 0.013-0.182]; relative risk, 0.71 [95%
CI, 0.52-0.96]; P = .03) (Table 2 and Figure 2).
No significant difference was observed between the 2
study groups with respect to the occurrence of new respira-
tory or renal failure, although the number of patients with a
new shock episode (absolute risk reduction, 0.068 [95% CI,
0.020-0.120]; relative risk, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.16-0.75];
P = .006) and liver failure (absolute risk reduction, 0.046
[95% CI, 0.008-0.088]; relative risk, 0.29 [95% CI, 0.10-
0.82]; P = .02) during their ICU stay was lower in the conser-
vative group. Although the occurrence of new infections
was similar between groups, the conservative oxygen strat-
egy was associated with a lower risk for bloodstream infec-
tion (absolute risk reduction, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.00-0.09]; risk
reduction, 0.50 [95% CI, 0.25-0.998; P = .049) and more
hours free from mechanical ventilation (median difference
24 hours; P = .02) (Table 2).
The analysis of the intent-to-treat population, which in-
cluded 478 patients, yielded results similar to those of the
modified intent-to-treat analysis with respect to primary out-
come, hospital mortality, and secondary outcomes (eTable 2;
eFigure 4 in Supplement 2).
In the subgroup post hoc analysis, the conservative oxy-
gen strategy reduced the risk for ICU mortality in patients
with respiratory failure (absolute risk reduction, 0.05 [95%
CI, 0.00-0.09]; relative risk, 0.67 [95% CI, 0.46-0.96]) who
received mechanical ventilation at study enrollment (relative
risk, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49-0.98) or who had a length of stay less
than the overall median (relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-
0.98) (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).

saturationtarget(94%-98%)wasassociatedwithimprovedout-
comes compared with conventional oxygen administration in
which oxygen partial pressures were significantly higher. An
absolute reduction of 8.6% was observed in the conservative
oxygen group. To our knowledge, this is the first randomized
clinical trial to evaluate the effect of a conservative
oxygen therapy on mortality compared with a standard,
moreliberalapproachinamedical-surgicalpopulationofadult
critically ill patients. Furthermore, as previously observed,15
our data revealed a U-shaped relationship between time-
weighted PaO2 values and mortality, with the highest mortal-
ity observed in patients exposed to an overall average time-
weighted PaO2 of 107 mm Hg or higher during their ICU stay.
Several observational studies demonstrated an associa-
tion between arterial hyperoxia and increased mortality in
different subsets of critically ill patients.21 In accordance with
our data, a recent prospective before-after study in mechani-
cally ventilated patients showed that a conservative oxygen
supplementation strategy was feasible, safe, and associated
with a trend toward less nonrespiratory organ dysfunction
and greater reduction of lactate levels.22 Oxygen administra-
tion in the conservative group of this study was titrated to
obtain SpO2 values of 90% to 92%, lower than those used in
our study (94%-98%), whereas the SpO2 targets in the con-
ventional group were similar.
In our trial, conservative oxygen administration was as-
sociated with new infections, mostly bacteremia, and fewer
new episodes of shock. These findings may be explained by
the possible detrimental effects of hyperoxia on the innate
immune system. In vitro, exposure to short-term high levels

of normobaric hyperoxia (FiO2 ≥80%) attenuates cytokine
production by human leukocytes23 and induces structural
changes within alveolar macrophages, with a significant im-
pairment of their antimicrobial activity and a marked reduc-
tion in the production of inflammatory cytokines in response
to stimulation.24,25 In an animal model of pneumonia, dis-
semination of infection within the lung and spleen, as well as
mortality rates, increased significantly in mice exposed to nor-
mobaric hyperoxia compared with infected mice maintained
in room air.26 Similarly, in a cecal ligation and puncture model,
rats subjected to higher inspired oxygen concentrations
showed greater increases in reactive oxygen species produc-
tion, serum IL-6 and IL-10 levels, and infected biological
samples, suggesting a possible influence of hyperoxia on the
inflammatory response and mechanisms of bacterial
clearance.27 In the above-cited models, the animals were ex-
posed for a short time to considerably higher inspired oxygen
levels than those used in our study. Human studies on the ef-
fects of hyperoxia on the immune system are scarce. In pa-
tients undergoing thyroid surgery, the postoperative levels of
C-reactive protein, IL-6, and IL-1b were lower because of use
ofperioperativesupplemental80%FiO2ratherthan30%FiO2.28
On the other hand, Kiers et al29 recently observed that a short
period of hyperoxia (3.5 hours; FiO2 100%) does not influence
whole blood cytokine production, neutrophil phagocytosis, or
reactiveoxygenspeciesgenerationduringanexperimentalmu-
rine and human endotoxemia.
Hyperoxia-inducedpulmonarytoxicityleadstohistopatho-
logicchangessimilartothoseobservedinacuterespiratorydis-
tress syndrome and ventilator-induced lung injury.30,31 How-
ever, in the present study, the occurrence of new respiratory
failures did not differ between the 2 groups. The high percent-
age of patients with respiratory failure at study inclusion (58%)
may have hampered the sensitivity of our study to this out-
come.Nevertheless,patientsassignedtotheconservativegroup
did show an increase in mechanical ventilation–free hours in
comparison with those assigned to the conventional group, for
whom excessive oxygen supplementation may have exacer-
bated the preexisting lung injury or hindered recovery. In ad-
dition,theposthocanalysisshowedthattheconservativestrat-
egy seemed to provide a significant reduction of ICU mortality
risk in patients with respiratory failure who received mechani-
cal ventilation at baseline (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). Our data
do not allow further speculation on this hypothesis, which
should be explored with appropriate study.
Several limitations must be acknowledged. This was a
single-center open-label study, albeit of reasonable size, con-
ducted in the ICU of a university hospital and stopped early
for low inclusion rate because of difficulties with access to eli-
giblepatients.Theunplannedearlyterminationofthetrialmay
have exaggerated the effect size. By assuming the same mor-
tality observed, the estimation of study results had the trial
continued to accrue patients until the planned size (330 pa-
tients per group) resulted in 95% CIs from 2% to 14%. Be-
cause the planned difference for futility of 6% was not en-
tirely ruled out by these CIs, confirmation of effect and
generalizability need to be tested by larger clinical trials. To
avoid incomplete and uncertain data on the occurrence of new
organ dysfunctions and infections during ICU stay, we used a
modified intention-to-treat population for primary analysis,
excluding patients with length of stay less than 72 hours and
less than 1 arterial blood gas analysis per day. Nevertheless, the
analysis of primary and secondary outcomes in the intention-
to-treat population (478 patients) confirmed data observed in
the modified intent-to-treat population (see eTable 2 and eFig-
ure 4 in Supplement 2). The sample size did not allow a de-
tailed analysis of the effects of hyperoxia in different popula-
tion subsets; the modified intent-to-treat population included
only 31 patients (6.9%) with cerebral stroke or traumatic brain
injury and 19 (4.4%) with acute myocardial infarction. In ad-
dition, despite randomization, patients in the conventionally
treated group tended toward higher illness severity at base-
line. The Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and the per-
centage of patients who received mechanical ventilation, had
shock, had documented infection, and had respiratory, liver,
or renal failure were slightly larger in this group. This imbal-
ance may have been responsible, at least in part, for the dif-
ferences observed in ICU mortality. The use of daily time-
weighted PaO2 may be only an approximation of the true
exposure to hyperoxia in patients for whom only 1 to 2 blood
gas analyses were performed daily. As advised by our ethics
committee, we did not perform more frequent PaO2 assess-
ments to avoid possible confounding introduced by changes
in the standard of care rather than by different oxygen expo-
sures. In addition, the incidence of new infection may have
been underestimated because only those ascertained by mi-
crobiological samples were considered.
Conclusions
Among critically ill patients with an ICU length of stay of 72
hours or longer, a conservative protocol for oxygen therapy
compared with conventional therapy resulted in a lower ICU
mortality. However, these preliminary findings were based on
unplanned early termination of the trial, and a larger multi-
center trial is needed to evaluate the potential benefit of such
conservative oxygen therapy in critically ill patients.
