Epidemiologic studies indicate that obesity increases the risk of 
severe complications and death from influenza virus infections, 
especially in elderly individuals. This work investigates the effect of 
obesity on the duration of viral shedding within household trans-
mission studies in Managua, Nicaragua, over 3 seasons (2015–
2017). Symptomatic obese adults were shown to shed influenza 
A virus 42% longer than nonobese adults (adjusted event time 
ratio [ETR], 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06–1.89); no 
association was observed with influenza B virus shedding dura-
tion. Even among paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic adults, 
obesity increased the influenza A shedding duration by 104% 
(adjusted ETR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.35–3.09). These findings suggest 
that obesity may play an important role in influenza transmission.

Epidemiologic studies indicate that obesity increases the risk of 
severe complications and death from influenza virus infections, 
especially in elderly individuals [1, 2]. The global prevalence of 
obesity has increased dramatically over the last few decades. 
The regional burden varies widely—in 2014, the prevalence of 
adult obesity in the United States was 35.5%, compared with 
17.4% in Nicaragua and 4.4% in other low-income economies—
but in every region, adult obesity is increasing, and the pace of 
increase is accelerating [3].
Both the duration and quantity of viral shedding influence 
influenza transmission [4, 5]. Children are known to be import-
ant for influenza transmission, and young age has been associ-
ated with longer duration of shedding [6]. Shedding has also 
been shown in paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic influenza 
cases, highlighting the transmission potential of less severe 
cases [7].
Obesity leads to altered immune function and chronic 
inflammation, which increases with age, in addition to mechan-
ical difficulties in breathing and increased oxygen require-
ments [8–10]; these are plausible mechanisms by which obesity 
could alter influenza risk, severity, and transmission potential. 
We hypothesize that this immune dysfunction could lead to a 
longer duration of influenza virus shedding, possibly increas-
ing the transmission potential of infected individuals. While 
obesity is associated with severe influenza outcomes [1, 2], the 
effect of obesity on less severe influenza infections and trans-
mission dynamics has not been as well studied. Here, we use 
household influenza transmission studies to examine the asso-
ciation between obesity and influenza virus shedding duration.
METHODS
Study Population and Procedures
This work uses data from 2 studies of households in the catch-
ment area of the Health Center Sócrates Flores Vivas (HCSFV) 
in District II of Managua, the capital of Nicaragua. Three influ-
enza seasons are included: late 2015, 2016/2017, and mid/late 
2017. The Household Influenza Transmission Study (HITS) 
has a case-ascertained design, in which cases were identified 
from the HCSFV study clinic and their households enrolled; it 
provided data for the first 2 seasons. The Household Influenza 
Cohort Study (HICS) has the same design features as the HITS; 
it is nested within a prospective cohort study, in which enroll-
ment occurs before the introduction of influenza to the house-
holds. The HICS started in 2017 and provided data from the 
2017 influenza season. Height and weight measurements were 
collected at enrollment. Each measurement was taken twice; if 
there was a difference of >5% between the 2 measurements, a 
third was taken. Measurements were averaged.
For both studies, participating household members were 
intensively monitored for 10–13 days once a symptomatic influ-
enza case was identified in the household. A full description of 
the inclusion criteria has previously been published [6]. Daily 
symptom diaries were recorded for all participants and up to 
5 combined nasal/oropharyngeal swab specimens, and tem-
peratures were measured for each household contact during 
follow-up, regardless of symptoms. As with our other studies, 
if a participant visited the HCSFV study clinic while enrolled,

 BRIEF REPORT • JID 2018:218 (1 November) • 1379
data from the visit were collected and were available for study 
use [11]. As described previously, all respiratory swab samples 
are tested by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) analysis following validated Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention protocols for influenza A and B virus 
detection [6]. Subtype and lineage are obtained for all influenza 
A and B virus–positive samples, respectively, through addi-
tional RT-PCR assays.
Ethics Statement
These studies were approved by the institutional review 
boards at the Nicaraguan Ministry of Health, the University of 
Michigan, and the University of California, Berkeley. Informed 
consent or parental permission for minors was obtained from 
all participants. Assent was obtained for children aged ≥6 years.
Weight Status
Body mass index (BMI) z scores were calculated for children 
<18 years old, based on the World Health Organization child 
growth standard for children aged <5 years and reference 
for children aged 5–17 years [12, 13]. BMI was calculated 
for adults as the weight in kilograms divided by the height 
in meters squared. Obesity was defined as a BMI of ≥30 in 
adults and as a BMI z score of >3 or >2 for children aged <5 
or 5–17 years, respectively. Underweight was defined as a BMI 
of <18.5 in adults and as a BMI z score of ≤2 in children. The 
nonobese reference group was defined as those who were not 
underweight or obese.
Shedding Duration
Shedding duration was defined as the time from illness onset to 
viral shedding cessation, as described previously [6]. Symptom 
data were obtained from daily symptom diaries and clinic visits, 
and illness was defined as acute respiratory illness (ARI2) with 
at least 2 of the following symptoms: measured fever (tempera-
ture >37.8°C) or reported fever, sore throat, cough, or runny 
nose on any day. Illness onset was defined as the earlier of the 
day that symptoms first appeared or that RT-PCR results were 
positive; if there were gaps >2 days without symptoms, illness 
onset was defined as the first day of the symptomatic period 
closest to the RT-PCR–positive event. Shedding cessation was 
defined either as occurring in the interval between the last pos-
itive RT-PCR result and subsequent negative RT-PCR result 
(interval censoring) or as right censored if the participant’s last 
sample was RT-PCR positive. To minimize left censoring, we 
restricted this analysis to secondary cases.
In sensitivity analyses, illness was also defined as RT-PCR pos-
itivity (regardless of symptoms) and as influenza-like illness (ILI; 
defined as measured or reported fever with cough or sore throat).
Statistical Methods
Parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models with Weibull 
distributions, which can handle censored data, adjusted for 
age and sex, were used to calculate event time ratios (ETRs) to 
compare shedding duration in obese versus nonobese partic-
ipants [4, 5]. Statistical analyses were conducted in R, version 
3.4.3 (available at: https://www.R-project.org/), using the pack-
age “Survival” (https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=survival), 
to run the AFT models and to predict mean shedding dura-
tion accounting for age and sex; “SurvRegCensCov” (https://
CRAN.R-project.org/package=SurvRegCensCov), to convert 
the model output to ETRs; and “ggplot2” (http://ggplot2.org), 
for plotting.
RESULTS
Study Population
In total, 1783 people in 320 households participated in inten-
sive monitoring periods. The HITS contributed 800 participants 
from the first 2 seasons, and the HICS contributed 983 partici-
pants in 2017 who were enrolled in intensive monitoring peri-
ods. These individuals provided 7066 swab samples for testing, 
with a mean number of 4.0 swabs/participant. Symptoms were 
reported for 15 905 days, with a median symptom diary dura-
tion of 10 days. There were 340, 631, and 812 participants in age 
groups 0–4, 5–17, and 18–92 years, respectively. Sex ratios were 
approximately equal in children but not equally distributed in 
adults, among whom 74% were women. The obesity prevalence 
varied significantly by age, with 2%, 9%, and 42% aged 0–4, 
5–17, and 18–92 years, respectively.
Secondary cases aged 5–92 years made up 287 of 694 
RT-PCR–positive influenza cases (41.3%); of these, 4 (1.4%) 
were missing height and weight data, and 9 (3.1%) were under-
weight and were excluded from analysis, leaving 276 secondary 
cases. Prevalence of obesity was similar among these secondary 
cases as compared to the overall study population that partici-
pated in intensive monitoring periods (Supplementary Table 1).
Of the 276 secondary cases included in the analysis, 19.9% 
were infected with 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus, 
38% were infected with influenza A(H3N2) virus, and 42% were 
infected with influenza B virus. Supplementary Figure 1 shows 
the epidemic curves by influenza virus type for each season 
(numbers are provided in Supplementary Table 2).
Shedding Duration
Children aged 0–4 years shed influenza virus 40% longer (crude 
ETR, 1.40; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.22–1.60) and chil-
dren aged 5–17 years shed influenza virus 30% longer (crude 
ETR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.15–1.48) than adults aged 18–92 years. 
These trends were similar for both influenza A and B viruses 
(Supplementary Table 3). However, influenza B virus shedding 
was longer and displayed larger variance than influenza A virus 
shedding for all ages. Mean predicted influenza virus shedding 
duration was 7.7 days, 7.2 days, and 5.5 days for ages 0–4, 5–17, 
and 18–92 years, respectively. Mean predicted shedding dura-
tion among individuals aged 0–4, 5–17, and 18–92 years was

7.0, 6.4, and 5.1 days, respectively, for influenza A virus and 9.3, 
8.8, and 6.4 days, respectively, for influenza B virus.
Obesity and Shedding Duration
Symptomatic obese adults shed influenza A virus 42% lon-
ger (adjusted ETR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.06–1.89) than nonobese 
adults, with predicted mean shedding times of 5.23 days versus 
3.68 days. They also shed influenza A(H1N1) virus 43% longer 
than nonobese adults (adjusted ETR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02–2.02). 
No association was observed between obesity and shedding dura-
tion for influenza B virus (Table 1 and Figure 1). Obesity was not 
associated with shedding duration in children aged 5–17 years 
(Supplementary Table 4). There were not enough obese second-
ary cases aged <5 years old to include in this analysis.
Varying the shedding definition in sensitivity analyses did 
not substantially influence our findings, although for influenza 
A(H3N2) virus, the association increased when using the ILI 
definition, and all associations increased when using the defi-
nition based on RT-PCR positivity regardless of symptoms 
(Supplementary Table 5).
Obese individuals with influenza tended to have more symp-
tomatic/severe illness, and fewer obese individuals had asymp-
tomatic influenza, although the differences were not significant 
(Supplementary Table 6). To examine whether the association 
of obesity and increased shedding duration existed among less 
symptomatic adults, the same analyses were performed among 
cases who had ≤1 symptom, not including fever. Of the 147 adult 
influenza cases, 40.8% had ILI, 69.4% had ARI2, 11.6% were 
paucisymptomatic (not including fever), and 17.7% were asymp-
tomatic; among nonobese cases, 16.5% were paucisymptomatic, 
and 18.7% were asymptomatic, compared with 3.6% and 16.1% 
of obese cases, respectively. Among cases with ≤1 symptom not 
including fever, obese adults shed influenza A virus 104% longer 
than nonobese adults (adjusted ETR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.35–3.09).

DISCUSSION
While previous studies identified obesity as a risk factor for 
severe influenza outcomes [1, 2], we showed that obesity also 
affects less severe outcomes by significantly increasing the 
duration of influenza A virus shedding in adults. Further, we 
found that, even in asymptomatic or mildly ill individuals, 
obese adults shed influenza A virus for a longer duration than 
nonobese adults. This has important implications for influenza 
transmission.
No association was found with obesity and duration of influ-
enza B virus shedding. It is unclear why this association is 
specific to influenza A virus, but it is consistent with previous 
findings of obesity and severe influenza outcomes primarily for 
influenza A(H1N1) virus [1, 2]. Human challenge studies also 
found more variability in influenza B virus shedding, compared 
with influenza A(H1N1) virus shedding [14]. Obesity was not 
associated with shedding duration in children 5–17 years old. 
This is in agreement with the hypothesis that obesity increases 
the shedding duration through chronic inflammation. The 
study was underpowered to assess this association in children 
aged <5 years.
In addition to studies of obesity and influenza severity, a 
recent study that sampled exhaled breath from college students 
with influenza for virus found an association between obesity 
and how much virus is shed. The authors noted that most par-
ticipants had nasal shedding and that obesity was associated 
with increased aerosol-based shedding; however, they did not 
assess whether obese individuals shed virus for a longer dura-
tion than nonobese individuals [15].
Here we focus on shedding duration, but virus quantity is 
also important; both are assumed to be positively associated 
with transmission, although the relationship was not found to 
be directly proportional within households and needs more 
investigation [5]. Owing to differences in contact patterns and 
types, transmission occurs earlier within households than in 
the wider community, which may reduce the impact of shed-
ding duration on transmission in the household setting [4, 16]. 
Further analyses are underway to examine the effect of obesity 
on influenza transmission in Nicaraguan households.
This study had several limitations. Nose and throat samples 
were only collected every 2–3 days (interval censoring), and 
cases for whom final samples were RT-PCR positive were right

censored, preventing observation of the precise shedding cessa-
tion time. Shedding was measured by RT-PCR, which only mea-
sures the presence of viral RNA but does not indicate whether 
the virus is infectious. In addition, quantitative data could have 
provided additional evidence on viral shedding, however, quan-
tification standards were not available at the time of testing.
This work has identified obesity as an important predictor 
of influenza A virus shedding duration in adults. Obesity may 
play an important role in influenza transmission, especially as 
the prevalence of obesity rises, and may be an important target 
for intervention and prevention strategies. Further, these results 
add to existing evidence linking obesity to infectious diseases, 
making it now even more important to work toward controlling 
and preventing the obesity epidemic.
