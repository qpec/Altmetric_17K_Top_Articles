IMPORTANCE Strategies to improve the nutritional status of those participating in the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) are of interest to policymakers.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the proposed policy of incentivizing the purchase of fruits
and vegetables and prohibiting the purchase of less nutritious foods in a food benefit
program improves the nutritional quality of participants’ diets.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Lower income participants (n = 279) not currently
enrolled in SNAP were randomized to 1 of 4 experimental financial food benefit conditions: (1)
incentive (30% financial incentive for fruits and vegetables purchased using food benefits);
(2) restriction (not allowed to buy sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods, or
candies with food benefits); (3) incentive plus restriction (30% financial incentive on fruits
and vegetables and restriction of purchase of sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked
goods, or candy with food benefits); or (4) control (no incentive or restrictions on foods
purchased with food benefits). Participants in all conditions were given a study-specific debit
card where funds were added every 4 weeks for a 12-week period. Outcome measures were
collected at baseline and in the final 4 weeks of the experimental period.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcomes (from 24-hour dietary recalls) included
intake of energy, discretionary calories, and overall diet quality.
RESULTS A number of favorable changes were observed in the incentive plus restriction
condition that were significantly different from changes in the control condition. These
included (1) reduced intake of energy (−96 kcal/d, standard error [SE], 59.9); (2) reduced
intake of discretionary calories (−64 kcal/d, SE 26.3); (3) reduced intake of sugar sweetened
beverages, sweet baked goods, and candies (−0.6 servings/d, SE 0.2); (4) increased intake of
solid fruit (0.2 servings/d, SE 0.1); and (5) improved Healthy Eating Index score (4.1 points, SE
1.4). Fewer improvements were observed in the incentive only and restriction only arms.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A food benefit program that pairs incentives for purchasing
more fruits and vegetables with restrictions on the purchase of less nutritious foods may
reduce energy intake and improve the nutritional quality of the diet of participants compared
with a program that does not include incentives or restrictions.

A
bout 1 in 7 Americans participated in the Supplement
Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) at some point in
2015.1 The Supplement Nutrition Assistance Pro-
gram, formerly known as the Food Stamp program, provides
funds to low-income families for purchasing food. Benefits are
provided on an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card that is
used like a debit card at stores. The funds are meant to supple-
ment (assist) households in purchasing food. In 2015 the av-
erage monthly benefit per household was $257.1
There is interest in identifying ways SNAP may better meet
its objective to help families buy the food they need for good
health because lower income families in the US are dispropor-
tionately obese, with poor diet quality contributing to this
health disparity.2-7 A variety of program modifications have
been proposed,8-15 including offering financial incentives for
the purchase of fruits and vegetables and prohibiting the pur-
chase of less nutritious foods, such as sugar sweetened bev-
erages with program funds.
Offering an incentive for the purchase of nutritious foods
might support the purchase and consumption of more health-
ful foods, but may not necessarily reduce the purchase or con-
sumption of less nutritious foods. Several studies have found
that incentives increase purchasing and/or consumption of in-
cented foods.16-20 But, the purchase and consumption of un-
healthy food may not change17,18,20 or may increase.16,19
ProhibitingthepurchaseoflessnutritiousfoodswithSNAP
benefits (eg, soft drinks, candies) is a controversial proposal
that has been discussed and debated by public health advo-
cates and policy makers.8-15 It is unclear whether excluding
these types of foods from SNAP would improve the nutri-
tional quality of the diet because personal funds may be used
to buy foods prohibited from purchase using SNAP benefits.
To our knowledge no experimental studies have been con-
ducted to evaluate whether prohibiting the purchase of less
nutritious foods with SNAP benefits improves the nutritional
quality of foods purchased and consumed. Likewise research
is lacking on the effect of pairing restrictions with incentives.
Methods
This study was conducted to address these important, poten-
tially far-reaching policy-relevant questions using a random-
ized trial design. The primary dietary outcomes were energy
intake and discretionary calories (defined as calories from
added sugars, solid fats, and alcohol above moderate con-
sumption level). Other dietary outcomes included intake of
added sugars, solid fats, fruits and vegetables, foods re-
stricted,andoveralldietqualityasmeasuredusingtheHealthy
Eating Index (HEI)-2010.21 Household food security was ex-
amined as a secondary outcome and body mass index (BMI),
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters
squared, as an exploratory outcome.
All aspects and procedures of this study were approved
by the University of Minnesota institutional review board
for the protection of human research subjects. Written
informed consent was obtained for all participants, and
incentives (gift cards to a discount retailer) were provided for
completion of study measures. The trial protocol is included
in Supplement 1.
Study Design
Lower income adults not currently enrolled in SNAP were re-
cruitedintoa2×2randomizedfactorialexperiment.Afterbase-
line measures were completed, participants were random-
ized to 1 of 4 financial benefit funds experimental conditions:
(1) incentive (30% financial incentive on fruits and veg-
etables purchased using food benefits); (2) restriction (not al-
lowed to buy sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods,
or candies with food benefits); (3) incentive plus restriction
(30% financial incentive on fruits and vegetables and not al-
lowed to buy sugar sweetened beverages, sweet baked goods,
or candies with food benefits); or (4) control (no incentive or
restrictions on foods that are purchased with food benefits).
Participants in all conditions were given a study-specific debit
card where funds were added every 4 weeks for a 12-week pe-
riod. Follow-up measures were collected in weeks 9 through
12 of the experimental period.
Eligibility Criteria and Recruitment
Households in the Minneapolis–St Paul, Minnesota metropoli-
tan area were recruited into the study. Individual level mea-
sures(eg,height,weight,dietaryrecalls)werecollectedfromthe
adult in the household most responsible for food shopping.
Forlegalreasonsitiscurrentlynotpossibletoaltertheprac-
tices of the actual SNAP program. Accordingly, study eligibil-
ity criteria were established with the aim of recruiting adults
in households that were near eligible for SNAP or eligible for
SNAP but not currently participating. Criteria included: (1) not
currentlyparticipatinginSNAP;(2)householdincomelessthan
or equal to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or partici-
patinginagovernmentprogram,suchastheDiversionaryWork
Program, which automatically qualifies household for SNAP
in Minnesota; and (3) adult in household most responsible for
food shopping is able to read and speak English and is willing
to participate. An asset test like that used to determine SNAP
eligibility in Minnesota (eg, ascertaining value of any ve-
hicles owned) was not applied. In addition, some other eligi-
bility criteria for SNAP participation (eg, US citizenship, no
felony drug conviction, etc) were not applied.
Our initial target sample size was 320 households. For our
power calculation we assumed an analytic sample size of 300,
and estimated that we could minimally detect a linear trend
of 4.5% declining change in energy intake per condition with
80% power and 2-tailed 5% α error, and prepost test correla-
tion of 0.8. This is a small effect size of 0.19. Owing to reduc-
tions in the study budget the target was revised to 280 house-
holds (70 per condition). Therefore, power may be somewhat
lower than our initial estimate.
Recruitment was carried out in the Minneapolis–St Paul,
Minnesota metropolitan area by posting study fliers in com-
munity locations in neighborhoods with a high poverty rate;
distributing fliers through food pantries; and referrals from or-
ganizations that serve lower income households. Respon-
dents were screened for eligibility and scheduled for a clinic
visit if eligible and interested in participating.

Baseline Measures
Atabaselineclinicvisit,participantswereconsentedandgiven
a questionnaire to assess demographics and household food
security (US Household Food Security Survey Module: 6 Item
Short Form22 modified to ask about past the 30 days). Partici-
pant height was measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a stadi-
ometerandweightwasmeasuredtothenearest0.1kgonacali-
brated digital scale following standard protocols.23 Body mass
index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared. During the visit participants were in-
structed to collect food purchase receipts for all foods pur-
chased for the 4 week baseline period and each week of the
experimental period.
Within 21 days following the baseline visit 3 unan-
nounced 24-hour dietary recalls were collected over the tele-
phone by trained and certified interviewers using the Nutri-
tion Data System for Research.24
Follow-up Measures
In the final 4 weeks of the experimental period (weeks 9-12 fol-
lowing randomization) 3 dietary recalls were collected and a
follow-upclinicvisitwasscheduledduringwhichbaselinemea-
sures were repeated.
Incentives (gift cards to a discount retailer) were pro-
vided as follows: $15 for each clinic visit; $40 for each set of 3
dietary recalls (prorated to encourage completion of all 3); and
$30 for every 4 weeks of receipt collection.
Experimental Procedures
Thosewhocompletedthebaselinemeasuresandremainedeli-
gible (SNAP EBT card usage not detected on baseline food pur-
chase receipts) were randomized to 1 of 4 experimental con-
ditions (Table 1).
Restriction:sugarsweetenedbeverages,candies,andsweet
baked goods were selected for restriction in the restriction and
the incentive plus restriction arms because these food catego-
ries are leading contributors to discretionary calories in the
American diet and contribute minimally to vitamin and min-
eral intake.25-29
Financial incentives: fruit and vegetable intake is insuffi-
cient for 44% and 42% of SNAP participants respectively,3
hence these food categories were selected for incentivizing in
the incentive and incentive plus restriction arms. The incen-
tive was 30% of purchase price, and the amount was based on
previous research.30
After random assignment to condition, a meeting was
scheduled to orient the participant to his or her assigned ex-
perimental arm. While complete blinding was impossible, we
did not share the experimental details of the study with par-
ticipants; they were blind to other conditions. The partici-
pant was given a debit card and told the dollar amount to be
added to the card every 4 weeks over the 12-week experimen-
tal period (3 deposits). The amount placed on the card every
4 weeks was the average benefit amount provided by SNAP in
Minnesota’
s Hennepin and Ramsey counties to those with the
same household size as the participant ($152 monthly for a
householdof1,$277monthlyforhouseholdof2,$401monthly
for household of 3, etc). Verbal and written instructions were
providedregardingallowableandnonallowablepurchases.The
food purchase receipt collection procedures (weekly submis-
sion of all food purchase receipts) were reviewed, with a fo-
cus on the role they play in monitoring compliance with food
purchase rules and determining the incentive amount. On a
weekly basis the amount of incentive earned for purchasing
eligible fruits and vegetables was calculated from the re-
ceipts; the incentive amount was added to the participant’
s
debit card; and a text or email was sent to the participant no-
tifying her or him of the incentive amount added to their card.
Compliance in use of the study debit card in accord with
experimental procedures was encouraged by explaining ap-
propriate use (training), informing participants of errors made
(feedback), and termination of debit card for repeated or fla-
grant misuse (consequences).
Compliance was monitored using the food purchase
receipts submitted by participants in conjunction with
transaction information (date, dollar amount, and location)
available through the bank that administered the debit
cards.
A set of criteria were used to determine when noncompli-
ance with experimental procedures warranted termination of
debit card funds (withdrawal of funds from the debit card and
discontinuation of addition of funds). Consistent with an in-
tent to treat approach to trial design and analysis, follow-up
measures were sought from those terminated.

Statistical Analysis
Because loss to follow up was low overall and for each of the
conditions, the analytic sample was restricted to those with
baseline and follow-up measures (n = 265).
A measure of usual intake for each food and nutrient of in-
terest at baseline and follow-up was estimated by averaging
intake estimates from the multiple 24-hour dietary recalls col-
lected from each person at each measurement period. Those
with only 1 dietary recall at baseline or follow-up (n = 14) were
excluded from analyses in which food or nutrient intake was
the outcome of interest because a single recall is a poor rep-
resentation of usual intake owing to high day-to-day varia-
tion in diet.
Means and frequencies were calculated for the demo-
graphic and health characteristics of those in each experimen-
tal condition. General linear regression models31 were used to
evaluate differences in outcomes at follow-up by experimen-
tal condition. Outcome measures (eg, change in energy in-
take from baseline to follow-up) were separately regressed on
an experimental condition indicator. Participants with ex-
treme studentized residuals as identified in SAS statistical soft-
wareprocGLM(version9.3,SASInstitute)wereexcluded(n = 0
to6dependingonnutrient/foodgroup).Becausenoconfound-
ing was expected as a result of randomization and the distri-
bution of potential confounders appeared to be similar across
experimental conditions (Table 2) no covariates were in-
cluded in the final models.
All analyses were planned a priori and all outcomes ex-
amined are reported herein. A P value of less than .05 was the
criterion for statistical significance.

Results
Between August 2013 and May 2015, 279 participants com-
pleted baseline measures and were randomized to 1 of the ex-
perimental conditions (Figure). Most (95%; n = 265) com-
pleted the follow-up measures. Completion rates were similar
across experimental conditions (93%-97%). The demo-
graphiccharacteristicsofthosewhocompletedfollow-upmea-
suresweresimilartothosewhodidnotwith1exception.Those
who completed follow-up measures were significantly more
likely to have some education beyond high school (72%) com-
pared with those who did not (43%).
Sixteen participants (6%) had their debit card funds dis-
continued owing to noncompliance with experimental proce-
dures. Similar numbers were discontinued from each experi-
mental condition (incentive arm, n = 3; restriction arm, n = 5;
incentive plus restriction arm, n = 3; and control arm, n = 5).
Reasons for discontinuation included use of the debit card to
purchase nonfood items (n = 9); SNAP EBT card use detected
on food receipts (n = 6); and use of debit card to purchase in-
eligible foods to the extent that the infraction limit was ex-
ceeded (n = 1). Seven of the 16 participants completed fol-
low-up measures.
Those in the incentive and incentive plus restriction
arms received incentives on eligible fruit and vegetable pur-
chases that totaled, over the 12-week intervention period, an
average of $41.25 and $44.69 respectively (eTable 1 in Supple-
ment 2).
Most participants were female with an average age of 44.5
years. African Americans comprised 52.7% (n = 139) of the
sample followed by those who self-identified as white (29.2%;
n = 77) or biracial (13.3%; n = 35). Most were either over-
weight (24.0%; n = 62) or obese (57.4%; n = 148). Household
food security was low (34.0%; n = 90) or very low (46.0%;
n = 122) for most. Ten percent of participants reported cur-
rentlyparticipatinginWIC.Thirty-sevenpercentreportedusing
an emergency source of food (eg, food pantry) in the past
month. About one-half reported participating in SNAP in the
past. Demographic factors were similar across experimental
conditions (Table 2).
Differences (changes) in food and nutrient intake be-
tween baseline and follow-up by experimental condition are
presented in Table 3.
Change in energy intake was found to differ significantly
between the restriction (−105 kcal/d; SE, 87.5) and incentive
plus restriction (−96 kcal/d; SE, 85.4) arms compared with the
control arm (80 kcal/d; SE, 61.1).
Change in energy from discretionary calories for the in-
centive plus restriction arm (−64 kcal/d; SE, 38.6) was signifi-
cantly different from the control arm (13 kcal/d; SE, 27.5). For
discretionary calories as a percent of total energy, changes dif-
fered between the incentive plus restriction (−2.8%; SE, 1.7%)
and the restriction (1.0%; SE, 1.7%) arms.
Change in sugar sweetened beverage intake was found to
differ between those in the incentive (−0.3 servings/d; SE, 0.2)
and incentive plus restriction (−0.3 servings/d; SE, 0.2) arms
compared with those in the control arm (0.2 servings/d; SE,
0.1).
In comparing change in consumption of all the foods tar-
geted for restriction in the restricted and incentive plus
restriction conditions (sugar sweetened beverages, candies,
and sweet baked goods) 2 statistically significant differences
between conditions were found. Change in servings of

Reductions in the percent of households that reported low
or very low food security were observed in all experimental
arms (Table 4). The magnitude of change was significantly
smaller for the control arm (−31.8%) compared with the other
arms (−53.7 to −60.3).
No statistically significant group differences in change in
BMI were observed (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).

this threshold none of the results are statistically significant.
Discussion
A number of favorable changes in diet were observed in the
incentive plus restriction condition that were significantly
different from changes in the control condition. These
included reduced energy intake; reduced intake of discre-
tionary calories; reduced intake of sugar sweetened bever-
ages, sweet baked goods, and candies; increased intake of
solid fruit; and improved HEI-2010 score. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to examine the effects of pairing food
purchase financial incentives with restrictions on food and
nutrient intake.
Improvements in diet quality were also observed in the in-
centive relative to the control condition. Intake of sugar sweet-
enedbeveragesdecreasedandintakeoffruitincreased(0.4serv-
ings/d; SE, 0.2 for total fruit and 0.2 servings/d; SE, 0.1 for solid
fruit). These findings are largely consistent with the results of
the USDA Healthy Incentive Pilot (HIP) study.20 In that study
fruitandvegetableconsumptionwas0.32servingsperdaymore
among SNAP participants receiving a 30% financial incentive
for purchasing fruits and vegetables compared with SNAP par-
ticipants not receiving this incentive (P < .001). Most of the dif-
ference between means was attributable to higher fruit intake
in the group receiving the incentive (0.23 servings/d; P < .001).
Consistent with our findings, the HIP study found similar in-
takesofenergy,addedsugars,solidfats,anddiscretionarycalo-
ries between those in the incentive and no-incentive groups.
The only statistically significant difference in diet ob-
servedintherestrictedarmcomparedwiththecontrolarmwas
a decrease in energy intake. This finding suggests that prohib-
iting the use of food benefits to purchase sugar sweetened bev-
erages,candies,andsweetbakedgoodsmaydecreaseenergyin-
take,thuspotentiallyaddressingconcernsrelatedtooverweight
andobesity.However,thenutritionalqualityofthedietmayoth-
erwise be unaffected. Although these findings cannot be com-
pared with those of other experimental studies because ours is
the first, econometric modeling studies suggest that restric-
tions on food items eligible for purchase in a food benefit pro-
gram such as SNAP could result in small decreases in expendi-
tures for restricted items.32
Theproportionofhouseholdswithloworverylowfoodse-
curitydecreasedmarkedlybetweenbaselineandfollow-upinall
4experimentalarms,whichisconsistentwithstudiesthathave
evaluated the effect of SNAP on household food security.33,34 It
isunclearwhytheproportionofhouseholdswithloworverylow

the other conditions. Increased food purchasing power is a po-
tentialexplanationforthearmsinwhichafinancialincentivewas

Limitations
Study limitations include the representativeness of our sample
with respect to the target population. Actual SNAP partici-
pantsmayresponddifferently,andtheexternalvalidityoffind-
ings may therefore be limited. In addition, only the diet of the
adult in the household most responsible for food shopping was
assessed. Consequently, the effects on other household mem-
bers such as children are unknown. Owing to the large num-
ber of statistical comparisons carried out (n = 128) it is likely
that some of the 20 statistically significant results are attrib-
utable to type I error. Other limitations include reliance on a
self-report measure of diet (as opposed to biomarkers), a short
experimentalperiod,anduseofadebitcardtomimicfoodben-
efits received through SNAP.
Study strengths include use of a randomized factorial
trial design. Food and nutrient intake was measured using
multiple dietary recalls collected at baseline and follow-up.
Although this method has shortcomings, it is among the
best self-report methods for assessing diet in free-living
populations.35
The greatest strength of the study may be its innovative-
ness and importance to public policy. In recent years Califor-
nia, Nebraska, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Maine, Ver-
mont, and Texas have either requested permission or urged
Congress to grant states more flexibility to set standards for
what can and cannot be purchased with SNAP benefits. For ex-
ample, in 2015 Maine proposed banning the purchase of soft
drinks and candy with SNAP benefits.15 These requests have
been made in the absence of research on the potential effect
of restrictions on nutrition and health. In 2010 New York City
proposed evaluating the health effects of a ban on the pur-
chase of sugar sweetened beverages with SNAP benefits in that
city.36 The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) denied the
request for several reasons including operational issues re-
lated to implementing such a program change and concerns
about the scientific integrity of the evaluation to be
conducted.14,37 Our study aimed to circumvent the opera-
tional concerns raised by the USDA. In addition, we were able
to carry out random assignment to experimental condition,
thus overcoming a major methodological issue inherent in
evaluating policy changes that occur at the population level.
Theseresultssuggestthatafoodbenefitprogramthatpairs
financial incentives for the purchasing of fruits and vegetables
with restrictions on the purchase of less nutritious foods may
reduce energy intake and improve the nutritional quality of the
diet of program participants in comparison with a food benefit
program that does not include incentives and restrictions.
