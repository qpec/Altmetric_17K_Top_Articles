ABSTRACT: Humulus lupulus L. (hops) is a popular botanical
dietary supplement used by women as a sleep aid and for
postmenopausal symptom relief. In addition to its efficacy for
menopausal symptoms, hops can also modulate the chemical
estrogen carcinogenesis pathway and potentially protect women
from breast cancer. In the present study, an enriched hop extract and
the key bioactive compounds [6-prenylnarigenin (6-PN), 8-
prenylnarigenin (8-PN), isoxanthohumol (IX), and xanthohumol
(XH)] were tested for their effects on estrogen metabolism in breast
cells (MCF-10A and MCF-7). The methoxyestrones (2-/4-MeOE1)
were analyzed as biomarkers for the nontoxic P450 1A1 catalyzed 2-
hydroxylation and the genotoxic P450 1B1 catalyzed 4-hydroxylation
pathways, respectively. The results indicated that the hop extract and
6-PN preferentially induced the 2-hydroxylation pathway in both cell
lines. 8-PN only showed slight up-regulation of metabolism in MCF-7 cells, whereas IX and XH did not have significant effects in
either cell line. To further explore the influence of hops and its bioactive marker compounds on P450 1A1/1B1, mRNA
expression and ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase (EROD) activity were measured. The results correlated with the metabolism data
and showed that hop extract and 6-PN preferentially enhanced P450 1A1 mRNA expression and increased P450 1A1/1B1
activity. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation by the isolated compounds was tested using xenobiotic response
element (XRE) luciferase construct transfected cells. 6-PN was found to be an AhR agonist that significantly induced XRE
activation and inhibited 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) induced XRE activity. 6-PN mediated induction of EROD
activity was also inhibited by the AhR antagonist CH223191. These data show that the hop extract and 6-PN preferentially
enhance the nontoxic estrogen 2-hydroxylation pathway through AhR mediated up-regulation of P450 1A1, which further
emphasizes the importance of standardization of botanical extracts to multiple chemical markers for both safety and desired
bioactivity.
■ INTRODUCTION
Hormone therapy (HT) has been the standard treatment
option for postmenopausal symptom relief for decades.1
However, HT has been linked with increased breast cancer
risk in a number of clinical trials including the Women’s Health
Initiative (WHI).2−4 As a natural and perceived safe alternative
to HT for postmenopausal system relief, botanical dietary
supplements have been increasingly popular.5,6 However,
rigorous interdisciplinary studies on the efficacy, potential
toxicity, and health benefits of these botanicals continue to be
in high demand.
Prolonged exposure to estrogens including HT increases
breast cancer risk.7−9 The two major mechanisms of carcino-
genesis are estrogen signaling (hormonal pathway) and
metabolism of estrogens to reactive quinones (chemical
pathway, Figure 1). Recently, a number of cohort studies
analyzing the risk correlation between estrogen levels, estrogen
metabolites, and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women
were conducted.10−12 The results indicated that higher estrogen
levels were associated with increased risk of postmenopausal
breast cancer, while enhanced estrogen 2-hydroxylation
suggested a lower risk for breast cancer. Various in vitro studies
have supported this finding that estrogen 2-hydroxylation
represents a detoxification pathway, whereas 4-hydroxylation is
correlated with malignant transformation.13−15
P450 1A1/1B1 are the major extra-hepatic P450 1 enzymes
that metabolize estrogens into 2- or 4-hydroxylated forms,
respectively (Figure 1).16 The expression is mainly controlled
by the upstream aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), which
translocates into the nucleus upon activation and binds to the
xenobiotic response element (XRE), initiating targeted gene
transcription.17 In breast tissues, these P450s are directly
correlated with the local estrogen metabolism.7−9 The 2- and 4-

 hydroxylated estrogen catechols can be further metabolized by
catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) to the more stable 2-
and 4-methoxy ether metabolites, which can be used as
biomarkers for 2- and 4-hydroxylation pathways.18,19
Hops (strobiles of Humulus lupulus L., Cannabaceae) have
been traditionally used as a sleep aid and, more recently, by
women for postmenopausal symptom relief.20,21 Many bio-
logical activities of hops have been connected to a series of
bioactive prenylated flavanones and chalcones such as 6-
prenylnarigenin (6-PN), 8-prenylnarigenin (8-PN), isoxantho-
humol (IX), and xanthohumol (XH) (Figure 2).22,23 The
predominant prenylated chalcone, XH, has been shown to be
an effective chemopreventive agent, inducing the detoxification
enzyme NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) in both
in vitro and in vivo studies.23−25 XH is metabolized to IX,
desmethyl xanthohumol, 8-PN, and 6-PN as shown in Figure
2.26,27 8-PN has been reported to be one of the most potent
estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) phytoestrogens known to date,
which is likely responsible for menopausal symptom relief.22,28
Previously, we showed that a hop extract was able to reduce
the potentially genotoxic estrogen 4-hydroxylation pathway and
decrease estradiol (E2) induced colony formation in human
nontumorigenic breast epithelial MCF-10A cells.18 The UIC/
NIH Center for Botanical Dietary Supplements Research has
further enriched a spent hop extract with respect to its
estrogenic (8-PN) and chemopreventive (XH) compounds
(Figure 2).29,30 The new standardized extract contained much
higher levels of the marker compounds than the previous
extract. The purpose of this study was to test the effect of this
standardized hop extract, which has been used in human clinical
trials,31 on estrogen metabolism. Since a relatively low response
was observed in MCF-10A cells, we also included the well
characterized breast cancer MCF-7 cell line to confirm the
bioactivities of the standardized hop extract as well as the
effects of the four major prenylated marker compounds. The
effects of this new hop extract and compounds on estrogen
oxidative metabolism in the two breast cell lines were studied.

Figure 1. Hypothesis: effect of botanicals on estrogen chemical carcinogenesis. P450 1A1 catalyzes the formation of 2-OHE1/E2 (detoxification
biomarker), which are clinically shown to be correlated with reduced breast cancer risk. P450 1B1 catalyzes the formation of 4-OHE1/E2 (genotoxic
biomarker), which is oxidized to the genotoxic estrogen-3,4-quinone (3,4-E1/E2-Q) and forms ROS through redox cycling. The reactive quinone and
ROS contribute to estrogen carcinogenesis. Chemopreventive botanicals are hypothesized to increase 2-hydroxylation and decrease 4-hydroxylation
metabolism, as shown with green and red arrows.

 P450 1A1/1B1 activity were also measured. Finally, XRE
activation was analyzed in both liver HepG2 cells and MCF-7
cells to confirm the mechanism of action. The results suggest
that hops can selectively enhance P450 1A1 catalyzed estrogen
2-hydroxylation and potentially reduce breast cancer risk.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Reagents. All chemicals and reagents were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) or Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA)
unless otherwise stated. S enantiomers of 6-PN and 8-PN were
purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). The ethanol extract of
botanically authentic spent strobiles of Humulus lupulus was obtained
from Hopsteiner (Mainburg, Germany, and New York, NY) and
standardized to the prenylated polyphenol marker compounds 6-PN,
8-PN, IX, and XH as previously described (Figure 2).29,30 Briefly,
standardization involved characterization by LC-UV, LC-MS/MS, and
quantitative 1H NMR (qHNMR). The same extract has been used in a
Phase I clinical trial in postmenopausal women.31 The concentrations
of the four marker compounds in this extract were 1.2% 6-PN, 0.33%
8-PN, 0.99% IX, and 32% XH.
Cell Lines and Culture Conditions. MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells
were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,
VA, USA). MCF-10A cells were cultured in 1:1 Dulbecco’s modified
Eagle medium and Ham’s F12 nutrient mixture (DMEM/F12) with
15 mM HEPES and L-glutamine (Invitrogen), supplemented with 20
ng/mL epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/mL cholera toxin, 0.5 μg/mL
hydrocortisone, 10 μg/mL insulin, 5% horse serum, and 1%
penicillin−streptomycin at 37 °C with 5% CO2 as described
previously.32 MCF-7 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 media
supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamax, 1% AB/AM,
1% nonessential amino acids, and 3 μg/mL insulin. All experiments
were done with cells under 15 passages in phenol-red free media
supplemented with charcoal stripped serum and the same other
ingredients.
Preparation of Estrogen Metabolite Samples. Estradiol and all
of the standard compounds of estrogen metabolites were obtained
from Steraloids Inc. (Newport, RI). 4-Methoxyestrone-1,4,16,16-d4
was obtained from CDN isotope (Pointe-Claire, Quebec) and used as
internal standard in the estrogen metabolites analysis. 2-Methoxy-
estrone and 4-Methoxyestrone were measured as indicators of the level
of estrogen 2-hydroxylation and the 4-hydroxylation pathway as
previously described with modifications.32,33 Briefly, cells were
estrogen starved for 24 h before being seeded into 6-well plates.
Cells were incubated with E2 (1 μM) in the presence and absence of
hop extract (0.1−2.5 μg/mL) and 6-PN, 8-PN, IX, and XH (0.1−6
μM) for 2 days. Cell media were then collected and spiked with 0.4
nM internal and 2 mM ascorbic acid. The media were then extracted
with 2 × 4 mL of dichloromethane. The organic layers were then
combined and dried under a gentle flow of nitrogen. Derivatization
was performed with 100 μL of 0.1 M NaHCO3 buffer (pH 9.5) and
100 μL of dansyl chloride in acetone (1 mg/mL) at 60 °C in a water
bath with agitation for 10 min. Samples were then cooled on ice, and
50 μL of sample was analyzed by LC-MS/MS as described below.
Analysis of Estrogen Metabolites by LC-MS/MS. After
derivation, all samples were analyzed by a positive ion electrospray
tandem mass spectrometric method as previously described.32 Briefly,
LC-MS/MS was performed by using an Agilent 1200 series nano flow
LC system (Agilent Technologies, Aanta Clara, CA) coupled to an AB
SCIEX Triple Quad 5500 System (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA).
The liquid chromatography separation was carried out with a 100 mm
× 3 mm i.d. Waters BEH C-18 column packed with 1.7 μm particles
(Waters, Milford, MA) and maintained at 40 °C. Multiple reactions
monitoring transitions were selected as follows: 534.4−171.2 for the
detection of dansylated MeOE1 and 538.4−171.2 for dansylated
MeOE1-d4. Quantitation was performed using the Analyst software
(Applied Biosystems, Forster City, CA), and data were normalized to
the E2 control treatment in each independent experiment.
Quantification of P450 1A1/1B1 mRNA Expression via qPCR.
MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells at a density of 2.5 × 105 cells/mL were
plated in 6-well plates and treated with DMSO, hops, 6-PN, 8-PN, IX,
or XH for 24 h. RNA extraction, reverse transcription, and PCR were
performed according to manufacturers’ protocols as previously
described.32 The total RNA was extracted according to Qiagen’s
(Valencia, CA) RNeasy kit instructions. RNA was reverse transcribed
according to Invitrogen’s SuperScript III First-Strand Synthesis System
for RT-PCR. The resulting cDNA (2 μL) was used for real-time PCR
quantification using Applied Biosystems’ (Carlsbad, CA) StepOnePlus
Real-Time PCR System. Taqman gene expression master mix and
P450 1B1 primer with FAM/MGB probe from Applied Biosystems
were added to a 96-well reaction plate with cDNA to perform real-time
quantitative PCR (one cycle of 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min, 40
cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min). Data were analyzed
with the comparative CT (ΔΔCT) method to determine fold
difference in reference to the HPRT1 endogenous control.
Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase Activity Assay. EROD assay
measuring P450 1 enzyme activity was conducted both in cells and
with recombinant P450 1A1 and 1B1 enzymes as previously
described.34,35 Briefly, 1 × 105 cells/well were plated and treated
with hop extract or compounds for 2 days, cells were washed with PBS
and incubated with 2.5 μM 7-ethoxyresorufin and 1.5 mM salicylamide
in PBS at 37 °C. Fluorescence was measured every minute with
excitation at 530 nm and emission at 590 nm for 25 min with a BioTek
(Winooski, VT) Synergy H4 Hybrid Multi-Mode Microplate Reader.
For enzyme inhibition experiments, recombinant P450 1A1 and 1B1
protein with reductase were purchased from BD Biosciences (Woburn,
MA). P450 1A1 (0.15 pmole) or 1B1 (0.8 pmole) was preincubated
with test compounds or vehicle for 5 min at 37 °C in 200 μL of 50
mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 1 mM NADPH.
Negative controls were done in parallel without NADPH.
Fluorescence signals were not affected by these compounds in the
inhibition experiments. The reaction was initiated by adding 7-
ethoxyresorufin solution in potassium phosphate buffer to a final
concentration of 2.5 μM. IC50 and apparent Ki (Ki′) values were
calculated. Fluorescence was measured every minute after 5 s of mixing
for 25 min at 37 °C. Fluorescence with 7-ethoxyresorufin as substrate
was linear for more than 15 min, and the reaction rate was determined
from the slope of the linear regression curves plotted with data points
measured in the first 15 min.
XRE-Luciferase Reporter Assay. HepG2 and MCF-7 cells were
plated in 12-well plates overnight, and cells were transfected at 70%
confluency with luciferase and renilla plasmids (Promega, Madison,
WI), XRE pGL4.43 luciferase plasmid (1 μg), and pRL-TK (500 ng),
using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) for
6 h. After 6 h of transfection, cells were treated with hop extract/
compounds with and without the presence of TCDD (10 nM) for 24
h and lysed with passive lysis buffer. Lysates were centrifuged and
analyzed for luciferase activity according to Promega’s Dual-luciferase
Reporter Assay System protocol using the FLUOstar OPTIMA
luminometer (BMG Labtechnologies, Germany). The results were
plotted as fold induction of the control. The % of TCDD was obtained
by setting TCDD’s fold induction in the XRE-luciferase assay as 100%.
The fold induction of compounds was divided by the TCDD response
and multiplied by 100 to obtain the % of TCDD response.
Statistics. The data were expressed as the mean ± SEM of at least
three independent experiments. Significance was determined using
one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s post-test, comparing treatment
groups to the control (*p < 0.05).

Hop Extract and 6-PN Preferentially Induced Estrogen
2-Hydroxylation Metabolism in MCF-10A and MCF-7
Cells. Previously, we showed that a hop extract slightly
decreased the estrogen 4-hydroxylation pathway and had no
effect on the 2-hydroxylation pathway in MCF-10A cells in a six
day experiment.18 In the current study, two day metabolism
studies with the new clinical hop extract described in the
Material and Methods showed that this hop extract stimulated

 estrogen 2-hydroxyaltion (Figure 3A). One problem with the
MCF-10A cell line is its relatively low activities of P450 1A1/
1B1.36 In order to confirm the qualitative effects of hop extract
and the bioactive marker compounds, additional experiments
were done with the well characterized MCF-7 cells, which are
known to be much more sensitive for P450 1A1/1B1
inductions.36 The data showed much higher overall induction
of metabolism (10−20-fold), and 2-MeOE1 formation was
preferred similar to the MCF-10A data (Figure 3B). Although
the preferential induction was observed in both cell lines, the
differences in MCF-10A cells were more prominent than in
MCF-7 cells with both hops and 6-PN treatment. 6-PN was the
most potent compound tested, inducing 2-MeOE1 50-fold
compared to 40-fold for 4-MeOE1 in MCF-7 cells and 3.5-fold
for 2-MeOE1 induction versus 2-fold for 4-MeOE1 in MCF-10A
cells (Figure 3C and D). In contrast to the MCF-10A cell
experiments, 8-PN showed moderate induction of estrogen
metabolism in MCF-7 cells, which could be due to the higher
AhR mediated P450 1A1/1B1 induction in MCF-7 cells. XH
and IX did not have significant effects in either cell line. Overall,
the results in MCF-7 cells are comparable with the MCF-10A
data and suggested that hops and 6-PN preferentially induce
estrogen 2-hydroxylation metabolism in breast cells.
Hop Extract and 6-PN Preferentially Induced P450
1A1 mRNA Expression in MCF-10A and MCF-7 Cells.
P450 1A1/1B1 mRNA levels were analyzed 24 h after
treatment with hops and the bioactive compounds. In MCF-
10A cells, hop extract significantly induced P450 1A1 mRNA
expression to 7-fold, with no significant effect on 1B1 (Figure
4A). In MCF-7 cells, the induction levels were significantly
higher with 90- and 35-fold induction of P450 1A1 and 1B1
mRNA expression (Figure 4B). Regarding the hop compounds,
the only compound that significantly increased P450 1A1 and
1B1 was 6-PN, with an increase to 16- and 2-fold, respectively,
in MCF-10A cells (Figure 4C). In MCF-7 cells, qPCR analysis
also showed that 6-PN preferentially increased P450 1A1
mRNA levels to around 290-fold compared to the 25-fold
induction of P450 1B1 (Figure 4D). 8-PN significantly induced
P450 1A1 and 1B1 in MCF-7 cells (Figure 4D), yet not in
MCF-10A cells (Figure 4C), and this induction in MCF-7 cells
(90-fold and 20-fold, respectively) was less than that of 6-PN.
IX and XH did not show significant effects in either cell line.
Although these prenylated polyphenols share some common
structural moieties, their bioactivities show remarkable differ-
ences. These data correlate with the results from estrogen
oxidative metabolism, indicating that hops and 6-PN
preferentially increased P450 1A1 mRNA levels in breast cells.
Hop Extract and 6-PN Induced P450 1A1/1B1 Activity
in MCF-10A and MCF-7 Cells. P450 1A1/1B1 activity was
measured using the EROD assay in both cell lines after 2 days
of treatment with hop extract and bioactive compounds. In
MCF-10A cells, in the presence of the hop extract, a significant
dose−responsive induction was observed to a maximum of 0.04
pmol/min/well resorufin formed (Figure 5A). In MCF-7 cells,
the hop extract gave significantly higher EROD activity
compared to MCF-10A cells to a maximum of 0.25 pmol/
min/well resorufin (Figure 5B). With the hop compounds in
MCF-10A cells, only 6-PN increased P450 1A1/1B1 activity
dose-dependently to 0.05 pmol/min/well resorufin (Figure
5C). XH moderately induced the P450 1 activity even though
estrogen metabolism and P450 1A1/1B1 gene expression were
not affected; 8-PN and IX did not show significant effects. In
MCF-7 cells, significant induction of P450 1A1/1B1 activity
was observed with 6-PN and 8-PN (3 μM) to 0.8 and 0.2
pmol/min/well resorufin, while IX and XH did not have
significant effects (Figure 5D). Overall, the results from the
EROD activity assay were consistent with the results from
estrogen metabolism and P450 1A1/1B1 mRNA analysis.
Qualitatively, the data from these two cell lines were also
comparable and indicated that hops and 6-PN strongly induced
P450 1A1/1B1 activity in breast cells.
Figure 3. Hop extract and 6-PN preferentially induced 2-hydroxylation
metabolism in breast MCF-10A and MCF-7 cells. (A) MCF-10A cells
and (B) MCF-7 cells were treated with E2 (1 μM) and the hop extract
for 2 days, and media were collected and analyzed for 2-MeOE1 and 4-

MCF-7 cells were treated with E2 (1 μM) and 6-PN, 8-PN, IX, XH (1
μM), and TCDD (10 nM) for 2 days, and media were analyzed for 2-
MeOE1 and 4-MeOE1 metabolites. Results were normalized to fold
induction against estradiol treated cells. Data were plotted as the
means ± SEM of three independent experiments and analyzed by one-
way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison post-test to
compare treatment groups with the control group, *p < 0.05.

expression was analyzed via qPCR. Results were plotted as the means

 6-PN Increased XRE Activation and Acted as an AhR
Agonist. Human hepatoma HepG2 cells and MCF-7 cells
transfected with a XRE-luciferase construct were used to
measure the effect of bioactive compounds on AhR activation.
The cells were incubated with the compounds for 24 h after
transient transfection of the luciferase construct. Of the four
polyphenols, 6-PN and 8-PN significantly and dose-depend-
ently increased XRE-luciferase activity to around 6.5- and 10-
fold of the control at 10 μM, while XH and IX did not have
significant effects (Figure 6A). In the presence of the AhR
agonist TCDD (10 nM), a dose−responsive decrease in XRE
luciferase activity was observed with 6-PN and 8-PN cotreat-
ment (Figure 6B), which further suggested the interactions
with AhR. In MCF-7 cells, the XRE response was lower than
that in HepG2 cells (Figure 6C). 6-PN (5 μM) significantly
induced the activity, while 8-PN (5 μM) had no effect, which
correlated with the P450 1A1/1B1 activity and gene expression
analysis. The results indicated some cell selectivity of 8-PN and
also suggested 6-PN to be activating AhR in both breast and
liver cell lines. Finally, upon cotreatment of AhR antagonist
CH223191 and 6-PN (1 μM) in MCF-7 cells, the EROD
activity was inhibited dose−responsively (Figure 6D), which
further confirmed 6-PN to be an AhR agonist. In summary,
these results suggested that 6-PN acted as an AhR agonist in
both breast and liver cells.
Hop Compounds Inhibit Recombinant P450 1A1/1B1
Activity but Had Only Moderate P450 1A1/1B1
Inhibition in Cells. Various flavonoids have been previously
reported to inhibit P450 1A1/1B1 activities.37−39 To study the
inhibitory effects of hop compounds on P450 1A1/1B1, the
EROD assay with recombinant enzymes was conducted. All
four compounds acted as P450 1A1/1B1 inhibitors with IC50
values in the low micromolar range without selectivity for either
P450 1A1 or 1B1 (Table 1). However, the inhibitory activity of
these compounds in cell culture experiments was considerably
less than that with recombinant enzymes (Figures S2 and S3).
These data indicated the metabolism results were mainly the
result of induction of P450 1A1/1B1 enzyme levels and that
little direct inhibition of P450s should be observed at clinical
concentrations of hop supplements.
■ DISCUSSION
Estrogen exposure has long been linked with postmenopausal
breast cancer risk, especially since the WHI report in 2002.2,8,9
Estrogen carcinogenesis includes the hormonal mechanism
involving classical ER binding and estrogen signaling which
promotes cell growth and the chemical mechanism where
estrogens are converted to reactive quinones which modify
DNA leading to genotoxicity (Figure 1).7−9 The estrogen 4-
hydroxylation pathway is considered the genotoxic pathway by
forming the electrophilic/redox active estrogen-3,4-quinone
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) which causes DNA
damage.40,41 Contrary to estrogen 4-hydroxylation, estrogen
2-hydroxylation is a nongenotoxic pathway, and the metabolite,
2-Methoxyestradiol, has been shown to have antiproliferative/
anticancer activity.13 Several recent clinical trials analyzing
serum estrogen metabolite levels and the risk of postmeno-
pausal breast cancer further support the 2-hydroxylation
pathway as a marker for chemoprevention; however, the data
are inconclusive on the relationship between the estrogen 4-
hydroxylation and breast cancer risk.10−12,15

 P450 1A1 and 1B1 are the major enzymes in breast tissues
that are responsible for the local estrogen 2- and 4-
hydroxylation metabolism, respectively.42,43 These two en-
zymes share about 40% homology and are generally co-
upregulated upon AhR activation.44 AhR is also responsible for
the expression of several other Phase I and Phase II enzymes,
which are associated with the detoxification of environmental
carcinogens as well as the potential activation of pro-
carcinogens.45 P450 1B1 expression levels in tumors, as well
as carcinogen-induced P450 1B1 levels in cancer cells, are
higher than in normal tissues and cells.46−48
MCF-10A cells have been frequently used as a model to
study estrogen chemical carcinogenesis due to the absence of
ER and they present a nontumorigenic phenotype.8,32,49−51
However, the AhR mediated P450 1A1/1B1 induction in MCF-
10A cells is relatively low as reported previously36 and
confirmed in the present study. Data also suggest that the
Phase I and Phase II enzyme expression is variable in MCF-10A
cells depending on the confluence level in cell culture.52 In
addition, spontaneous expression of ER might occur in MCF-
10A cells after a certain number of passages.53 These potential
problems and the variability observed in the current experi-
ments prompted additional studies in the more robust MCF-7
cells.
MCF-7 cells have been used in estrogen metabolism studies
by numerous investigators.51,54,55 Spink et al. showed that
induction of P450 1A1/1B1 enzymes vary among different
tumorigenic and nontumorigenic cell lines. They determined
that MCF-7 cells had higher levels of TCDD-induced P450
1A1/1B1 mRNA and almost 8-fold higher metabolic rates for
TCDD-induced 4-MeOE2 formation compared to those of
MCF-10A cells.36 Similarly, our results showed more than 15-
fold increase in P450 1A1/1B1 gene induction with TCDD
treatment in MCF-7 over MCF-10A cells (Figure 4C and D)
and about 10-fold higher metabolite formation with hop extract
treatment in MCF-7 compared to that of MCF-10A cells
(Figure 3A and B). Since MCF-7 cells mirrored MCF-10A cells
in the response to botanical treatment with higher induction
levels, they serve as a better model to screen botanicals and
compounds for the modulation of estrogen metabolism. In
addition, the upstream P450 1A1/1B1 mRNA induction trend
among compounds (6-PN ≫ 8-PN and no effect with IX and
XH) corresponds with the metabolism and activity results in
MCF-7 cells. However, due to the presence of ER there is
potential crosstalk between AhR and ERα signaling pathways,
and AhR agonists have been reported to increase proteasomal
degradation of ER.56,57 The interesting relationship between
ERα, AhR, and botanical modulation of estrogen metabolism
will be the subject of future studies.
Botanicals have been previously shown to affect AhR
activation, and the major compounds responsible were
polyphenols.58,59 For example, resveratrol has been shown to
induce XRE activation to about 6-fold at 10 μM in MCF-10A
cells.50 In this study, HepG2 cells were used to compare the
AhR activation by hop compounds because the XRE-luciferase
reporter activity in HepG2 cells were much higher compared to
that in MCF-7 cells (Figure S7). Comparatively, in this study
XRE-luciferase activity was increased to 6.5-fold by 6-PN (10
μM) in HepG2 cells (Figure 6A). 8-PN displayed some cell
selectivity with about 10-fold XRE activation at 10 μM in
HepG2 cells but showed no effect in MCF-7 cells. In addition,
hop compounds also showed differential effects on P450 1A1/
1B1 regulation. Preferential induction of P450 1A1 over P450
1B1 has been documented in the literature. Quercetin (10 μM)
and berberine (>5 μM) preferentially induced P450 1A1 over
1B1 in MCF-10F and MCF-7 cells, respectively.60,61 In
contrast, benzo(a)pyrene (1 μM) preferentially increased
P450 1B1 in human oral epithelial cells.62 However, the
mechanisms of P450 1A1 and 1B1 preferential induction as well
as in vivo effects need to be further studied. 6-PN significantly
increased P450 1A1/1B1 activity and mRNA expression.
Induction of XRE activity and inhibition of TCDD induced
XRE activity further supported 6-PN to be an AhR agonist
(Figure 6). Induction of P450 1 enzymes by natural flavonoids
and flavonoid rich botanicals have been reported previously.58
Naringenin, a flavanone with the same scaffold as the hop
flavanones, does not induce P450 1A1/1B1,59,63 while the effect
of flavanones with a prenylated side chain has not been
studied.64 Results from this study indicated that prenylated
naringenin derivatives exhibit a unique activity compared to
that of the parent naringenin. In addition, the significant P450
1A1/1B1 induction by 6-PN compared to 8-PN may suggest
that the positioning of the prenyl group is important for AhR
activation.
The effect of hop compounds on TCDD-induced XRE-
luciferase reporter activity was also measured.65,66 The results
indicated that 6-PN and 8-PN had comparable effects in
inhibiting TCDD induced XRE-luciferase activity at micro-
molar levels (Figure 6B). Resveratrol, as well as the scaffold
parent compound naringenin, also demonstrated significant
inhibitory effects on TCDD induced EROD activity above 10
μM in MCF-10A cells.50,63 Similar studies looking at estrogen
metabolism using a MCF-10F cell model observed decreased
formation of 4-MeOE1/E2 and DNA adducts after cotreatment
with resveratrol (25 μM) and TCDD (10 nM).67 In contrast,
we previously showed that licochalcone A (10 μM), a B-ring
(C-5′) prenylated chalcone from licorice (Glycyrrhiza inflata),
was an AhR antagonist and shut down estrogen oxidative
metabolism in MCF-10A cells.32
Various botanical flavonoids have been identified as
inhibitors of P450 enzymes.37−39 It has also been shown that
flavonoids generally exhibit more potent P450 1B1 inhibition
over 1A1.68 Several ubiquitous, unsubstituted flavones and
flavonols, such as quercetin, kaempferol, and apigenin, have
been reported to be P450 1B1 inhibitors with IC50 values below
50 nM, while inhibiting P450 1A1 activity less potently.37,39,68
However, flavanones, like narigenin, are generally weak P450 1
inhibitors with IC50 values in the micromolar range, which
might indicate the importance of the C-ring 2−3 double bond
in P450 1 enzyme inhibition.37,69 Several hydroxychalcones
have been tested for the inhibition of P450 1A1 and 1B1 and
showed IC50 values in the low micromolar range.70 Our results
as well as previous studies from Henderson et al. showed that
the prenylflavanones from hops are more potent inhibitors
compared to the parent flavanone, naringenin.35 The hop
compounds had similar inhibitory activities toward P450 1B1,
with IC50 values around 0.5 μM; 6-PN showed around 3-fold
lower inhibitory activity to P450 1A1 (IC50 0.6 μM) than 1B1
(IC50 0.2 μM) (Table 1). When compared to resveratrol, which
inhibited P450 1A1 and 1B1 with IC50 values around 2 and 25
μM, respectively, these hop compounds are more potent P450
1 inhibitors.50 The hop compounds have also been shown to
inhibit P450 2C8, 2C9, and 19 with IC50 values in the low
micromolar range.71,72 However, in contrast to the experiments
with purified P450s, the hop compounds showed little to no
inhibition in cells (Figure S3), likely due to extensive

 metabolism.26,27 These data suggest that the effect on estrogen
oxidative metabolism modulation was mainly contributed by
the AhR agonist activity of 6-PN. The results from this study
suggests that hop extracts should be standardized not only to 8-
PN for estrogenic effects and to XH for chemopreventive
properties but also to 6-PN for its potential modulation of
estrogen metabolism. However, further studies are needed to
test and confirm the activities in vivo.31,73
In conclusion, results from this study provided novel in vitro
evidence that hops and its compound 6-PN preferentially
induced the nontoxic estrogen 2-hydroxylation pathway in two
different breast cell lines, which indicated a potentially
protective role of hops to help reduce the risk of breast cancer
through estrogen metabolism modulation. As hop dietary
supplements are taken widely by women for postmenopausal
symptom relief, it is important to expand our knowledge about
the bioactivity and safety of 6-PN and related hop compounds.
The clinical trial data have indicated long half-lives of these hop
compounds.31 Since the pharmacokinetic properties of the hop
compounds would significantly influence their effect in vivo, the
preferential 2-hydroxylation induction as well as modulation of
P450 1A1/1B1 enzymes would need to be tested with in vivo
models that will be studied in the future. The present data also
confirm the importance of performing botanical standardization
to several bioactive phyto-constituents simultaneously. Accord-
ingly, for hop extracts, suitable target markers are 8-PN
(estrogenic), XH (chemopreventive), and, as shown in the
present study, 6-PN (AhR agonist) as modulators of estrogen
metabolism. Assessing the levels of these compounds in
standardized hop extracts will be beneficial for the health
effects and enhance the safety of women consuming these
herbal preparations. Collectively, the present findings provide
additional rationales for a meaningful chemical and biological
standardization of safe and effective hop botanical supplements.
