Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are rapidly evolving species-specific natural killer (NK) cell recep-
tors associated with protection against multiple different human viral infections. We report that the activating 
receptor KIR2DS2 directly recognizes viral peptides derived from conserved regions of flaviviral superfamily 2 RNA 
helicases in the context of major histocompatibility complex class I. We started by documenting that peptide 
LNPSVAATL from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) helicase binds HLA-C*0102, leading to NK cell activation through 
engagement of KIR2DS2. Although this region is highly conserved across HCV isolates, the sequence is not present 
in other flaviviral helicases. Embarking on a search for a conserved target of KIR2DS2, we show that HLA-C*0102 
presents a different highly conserved peptide from the helicase motif 1b region of related flaviviruses, including dengue, 
Zika, yellow fever, and Japanese encephalitis viruses, to KIR2DS2. In contrast to LNPSVAATL from HCV, these flaviviral 
peptides all contain an “MCHAT” motif, which is present in 61 of 63 flaviviruses. Despite the difference in the pep-
tide sequences, we show that KIR2DS2 recognizes endogenously presented helicase peptides and that KIR2DS2 is 
sufficient to inhibit HCV and dengue virus replication in the context of HLA-C*0102. Targeting short, but highly 
conserved, viral peptides provide nonrearranging innate immune receptors with an efficient mechanism to rec-
ognize multiple, highly variable, pathogenic RNA viruses.
INTRODUCTION
Natural killer (NK) cells are critical determinants in the innate immune 
response to a number of globally important viral infections including 
HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus, and Chikungunya virus 
(1–4). Their functions are controlled by nonrearranging immune 
receptors, many of which are well conserved, consistent with a role in 
innate immunity. The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) 
are a rapidly evolving family of NK cell receptors that exhibit substan-
tial population diversity. They have peptide/MHC (major histocom-
patibility complex) class I specificity, and certain combinations of 
KIRs and their MHC class I ligands have been associated with the 
outcome of a number of viral infections including the inhibitory re-
ceptor KIR2DL3 and hepatitis C, and the activating receptor KIR3DS1 
and HIV (4, 5).
The KIRs have evolved rapidly since the divergence of humans 
from chimpanzees, in a manner indicative of pathogen-mediated se-
lection. One mechanism by which KIRs contribute to recognition of 
pathogens has been identified for inhibitory KIRs being related to the 
down-regulation of MHC class I (6). Conversely, there is little under-
standing of how activating KIRs can recognize pathogens. Recent 
work has shown that KIR3DS1, which shares sequence homology 
with human leukocyte antigen, class B (HLA-B)–specific inhibitory 
KIR3DL1, binds open conformers of HLA-F, and this may result in 
inhibition of HIV infection (7). However, the mechanisms by which 
the activating KIRs with putative HLA-C ligands recognize patho-
gens remain enigmatic (8).
Human KIRs bind subsets of HLA class I ligands and engage both 
the HLA class I heavy chain and the bound peptide. Furthermore, 
changes in the peptide content of HLA class I can abrogate KIR-mediated 
inhibition of NK cells, demonstrating a mechanism for KIR-associated 
NK cell activation that is distinct from HLA class I down-regulation 
(9). KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3 are inhibitory KIRs with a predominant 
specificity for the group 1 HLA-C allotypes (HLA-C1). Both these 
inhibitory receptors have similar specificities for peptide/MHC, as 
could be predicted from the high sequence homology of their extra-
cellular domains (10). The activating receptor KIR2DS2 also has ~98% 
amino acid identity in the ligand-binding domains to KIR2DL2 and 
KIR2DL3 and is in strong linkage disequilibrium with KIR2DL2. 
Despite this shared sequence homology, binding of KIR2DS2 to 
HLA-C has been difficult to identify. One of the key differences be-
tween KIR2DS2 and KIR2DL2/KIR2DL3 is the presence of a tyrosine 
(as compared with a phenylalanine) residue at position 45, and this 
is thought to substantially affect binding of KIR2DS2 to HLA-C (11). 
Low-level binding of KIR2DS2 to HLA-C in combination with an 
Epstein-Barr virus peptide was detected by surface plasmon resonance 
(12). More recently, KIR2DS2 has been demonstrated to have peptide- 
specific binding to HLA-A*1101, an HLA class I allele that binds a 
number of diverse KIRs including KIR2DS4 and KIR3DL2 (13, 14). 
KIR2DS2 has also been shown to bind cancer cell lines in a 2-microglobulin–
independent manner (15). Nonetheless, on the basis of the high sequence 
homology of KIR2DS2 with KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3, we sought to

specific receptor.
RESULTS
KIR2DS2 recognizes the HCV peptide LNPSVAATL in the 
context of HLA-C*0102
Immunogenetic analyses by Thio et al. have identified HLA-C*0102 
to be protective in the context of chronic HCV infection (16). On the 
basis of this observation, we used HLA-C*0102 as a template allele to 
identify peptides from HCV to determine how they may modulate NK 
cell function. We screened the HCV genotype 1b genome (AF313916.1) 
for potential HLA-C*0102 binding peptides using the algorithms 
ADT, NetMHCpan, and KISS, coupled with a manual scan using the 
known HLA-C*0102 motif xxPxxxxxL (17). We identified eight pep-
tides for further study (table S1). We used the transporter associated 
with antigen processing (TAP)–deficient 721.174 cell line, which ex-
presses HLA-C*0102 naturally, to present the HCV peptides in bind-
ing and functional assays. These cells are deficient in the TAP protein 
and hence can be used to present exogenous peptide to lymphocytes 
(18). Analysis of binding to HLA-C*0102 using peptide titrations demon-
strated that four peptides (LLPRRGPRL, AQPGYPWPL, LSPHYKVFL, 
and RAYLNTPGL) had a low affinity for HLA-C*0102, not reaching 
saturation point at 100 M; one [VLPCSFTTL (VLP)] had an affinity 
comparable to the endogenously presented peptide VAPWNSLSL, and 
the remainder [LSPRPVSYL, LNPSVAATL (LNP), and ARPDYNPPL] 
had an intermediate affinity for HLA-C*0102 (fig. S1).
To determine how these peptides modulate NK cell reactivity, we 
used the 721.174 cells. The CD158b epitope includes the KIR2DL2, 
KIR2DL3, and KIR2DS2 proteins and therefore marks NK cells with 
specificity for HLA-C*0102. We identified one peptide (LLPRRGPRL) 
that inhibited the activation of CD158b-positive (CD158b+) NK cells, 
but the remainder of the peptides had no effect on NK cell degran-
ulation relative to the “no peptide” control (fig. S2). In the absence 
of peptide, there is activation of CD158b+ NK cells by 721.174 such 
that 25 to 30% NK cells express CD107a (Fig. 1, A and B). To identify 
specific activation of KIR2DS2-positive (KIR2DS2+) NK cells, we re-
duced the background activation of CD158b+ NK cells by using an 
inhibitory peptide (VAPWNSFAL) and testing the ability of the pep-
tides to activate NK cells relative to this strong inhibitory signal. We 
used VAPWNSFAL because it was the strongest inhibitory peptide 
that we identified in a peptide screening assay for KIR binding and 
NK cell inhibition (9). From an initial screening assay using three 
unselected donors, we identified two peptides, LNP and VLP, which 
activated CD158b+ NK cells relative to VAPWNSFAL alone (Fig. 1A).
Because CD158b marks the inhibitory receptors KIR2DL2 and 
KIR2DL3 and the activating receptor KIR2DS2, we stratified the do-
nors by KIR genotype: KIR2DL2+KIR2DS2+KIR2DL3− (KIR2DL2/S2 
homozygous) and KIR2DL2−KIR2DS2−KIR2DL3+ (KIR2DL3 homo-
zygous). VLP activated CD158b+ NK cells relative to VAPWNSFAL 
alone in both KIR2DL2+/S2+/L3− donors and KIR2DL2−/S2−/L3+ do-
nors (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the effect of LNP on CD158b+ NK cells 
was present for KIR2DL2+/S2+/L3− donors but not for KIR2DL2−/
S2−/L3+ donors (Fig. 1, B and C). Conversely, no differences were 
found for the CD158b-negative (CD158b−) NK cells for either group 
of donors (Fig. 1D). This indicates that the increase in degranula-
tion was related either to KIR2DL2 or to KIR2DS2. KIR2DL2+ NK 
cells are less responsive to changes in peptide content of MHC class 
I than KIR2DL3+ NK cells (19). Therefore, we reasoned that this 
change in degranulation was related to NK cell activation through 
engagement of KIR2DS2.
To map this specificity more closely, we cloned NK cells from a 
KIR2DL2+KIR2DS2+KIR2DL3− donor. We tested three KIR2DS2+ NK 
cell clones against the 721.174 cells (fig. S3). We found that although 
LNP augmented lysis of 721.174 cells by KIR2DS2+ NK cell clones, 
background levels of killing against targets in the absence of peptide 
were high. We therefore sought an alternative strategy using the KIR- 
negative cell line NKL. We transfected NKL cells with either KIR2DS2 
or KIR2DL2 and used them as effector cells. We also generated 
721.221 target cells stably expressing either HLA-C*0102 alone or 
HLA-C*0102 and LNP together. In cytotoxicity assays, NKL-2DS2 
cells lysed 721.221:C*0102 cells to a level similar to that of untrans-
fected NKL cells but lysed LNP-expressing 721.221:C*0102 cells sig-
nificantly better than 721.221:C*0102 cells without LNP (Fig. 1, E and 
F). Thus, LNP specifically activates NKL cells expressing KIR2DS2 
but has no effect on KIR2DL2+ NK cells. As there were similar levels 
of killing of 721.221:C*0102 cells by NKL-2DS2 and NKL cells, this 
observed increased level of lysis is not related to a generalized in-
crease in baseline cytolytic activity of the NKL-2DS2 cell line against 
721.221 cells but is related to the specific recognition of the combi-
nation of LNP and HLA-C*0102 by KIR2DS2.
LNP engages KIR2DS2 but not KIR2DL2
To confirm the reactivity of KIR2DS2 with HLA-C*0102:LNP, we 
made a KIR2DS2 tetramer. In a binding assay, we detected low-level 
but consistent and significant binding of the KIR2DS2 tetramer to 
the peptide LNP (P < 0.001), as compared with the naturally eluted 
peptide VAPWNSLSL, as well as KIR2DS2 binding to the peptides 
VAPWNSATL and VAPWNAATL (fig. S4). This is in line with pre-
vious observations that positions 7 and 8 of the HLA class I peptide 
are important for KIR binding, as has been observed for the inhibi-
tory KIR. Because the binding of the tetramer was at a low level (~1.5 
times background), we used a clustering assay to determine wheth-
er a cell-cell contact assay could detect specific recognition of LNP 
by KIR2DS2. Transfectants of the Ba/F3 cell line expressing either 
KIR2DL2 or KIR2DS2 were used to investigate receptor clustering (20). 
These are murine B cells and hence do not express other human NK 
cell–activating receptors. The Ba/F3 transfectants were co- 
incubated 
with 721.174 cells pulsed with peptide. LNP induced clustering of 
KIR2DS2, but not of KIR2DL2, whereas the inhibitory peptide 
VAPWNSFAL induced clustering of KIR2DL2 only (Fig. 2, A and B).
To further determine whether the interaction of LNP with KIR2DS2 
led to NK cell activation, we studied signaling in the NKL cell lines. 
Activating KIRs transduce positive signals through the adapter mol-
ecule DNAX-activation protein of 12 kDa (DAP12), and antibody 
cross-linking of KIR2DS2 has been shown to lead to DAP12 phos-
phorylation (20). We therefore tested whether LNP could lead to acti-
vation of NK cells via DAP12. Immunoprecipitation of KIR2DS2 from 
NKL-2DS2 cells cocultured with 721.174 cells in the presence or ab-
sence of peptide demonstrated LNP-induced enhanced tyrosine phos-
phorylation of the coimmunoprecipitated DAP12, consistent with 
NK cell activation (Fig. 2C). Moreover, the presence of LNP augmented 
tyrosine phosphorylation of the downstream guanine nucleotide ex-
change factor Vav1 in NKL-2DS2 cells but had no effect on KIR2DL2 
signaling in NKL-2DL2 cells (Fig. 2D). We further tested whether 
KIR2DL2 could bind LNP in the context of C*0102 using a KIR2DL2-
Fc fusion construct. Consistent with the functional experiments, there 
was no direct binding of a KIR2DL2 fusion construct to LNP-pulsed

721.174 cells (Fig. 2E). Together, these data demonstrate that LNP 
specifically activates KIR2DS2+ NK cells through the DAP12-Vav1 
pathway but has no effect on KIR2DL2+ NK cells, establishing it as 
a peptide that discriminates an activating KIR from its closely related 
inhibitory counterpart.
KIR2DS2 recognizes LNP in the context of HCV infection
Having observed that KIR2DS2 recognized LNP in the context of 
HLA- 
C*0102 as both an exogenously and an endogenously loaded 
peptide, we wanted to test whether it could also recognize LNP in 
the context of HCV replication. To do this, we generated an HUH7 
cell line that stably expresses both the HCV subgenomic replicon 
N17 (JFH1E1E2-luc) and also HLA-C*0102. N17 contains the full-
length HCV genome without the envelope proteins and replicates as 
a wild-type virus; hence, it is considered that it pro 
duces proteins to 
a level similar to that of a wild-type virus (21). It also has a luciferase 
gene incorporated within the HCV construct to allow assessment of 
replication by a luciferase assay. HUH7 is a hepatoma cell line that 
expresses HLA-A*1101, but not HLA-B or HLA-C, and is permissive 
for HCV replication (22). We used the transfected NKL cell lines to 
assess the potential for KIR2DS2 to specifically inhibit replication of 
N17 in this system. NKL-2DS2 inhibited HCV replication at low E/T 
ratios (0.01:1) in the HLA-C*0102–expressing HUH7 cells to a sig-
nificantly greater extent than parental NKL cells or NKL-2DL2 cells 
(Fig. 3A, right). Conversely, in the parental HUH7 cell line, which is 
HLA-C–negative, NKL, NKL-2DL2, and NKL-2DS2 inhibited HCV

replication to similar levels (Fig. 3A),  
suggesting that KIR2DS2 re-
quires the presence of HLA-C to inhibit HCV replication.
To investigate the role of the LNP peptide in the inhibition of HCV 
replication by KIR2DS2, we made nonconservative aspartate variants 
of the N17 replicon at the HLA-binding anchor residues P3 and P9 
and the putative KIR binding residues P7 and P8 (17). Mutation of 
P9 retained HCV replication to wild-type levels, but mutation of the 
P3, P7, or P8 residue in this epitope profoundly inhibited replica-
tion of the N17 replicon viral RNA to a level similar to that of the 
nonreplicating control, which has a lethal “GND” polymerase mu-
tation (Fig. 3B) (23). We therefore performed inhibition of replica-
tion assays using only the P9 leucine-to-aspartate N17 variant (L9D). 
In these assays, there was no specific effect of KIR2DS2 noted (Fig. 3C), 
suggesting that KIR2DS2 recognition of HCV in the context of 
HLA- 
C*0102 is dependent on the LNP epitope.
To test the HLA-C specificity of this response, we transfected 
HUH7 cells, expressing either the N17 replicon or the mutated N17-
L9D replicon, with HLA-C*0304. NKL-2DS2 inhibited HCV replica-
tion to a significantly greater extent than NKL-2DL2 or the parental 
NKL cell lines at all E/T ratios tested (Fig. 3D). However, this was 
not related to the LNP peptide because NKL-2DS2 also inhibited rep-
lication of the N17-L9D replicon to a similar extent. LNP was un-
able to stabilize HLA-C*0304 in a peptide stabilization assay using 
721.221:HLA-C*0304 cells transfected with ICP47, which blocks TAP 
function (Fig. 3E). Furthermore, using the same cell lines to present 
peptide, LNP did not engage KIR2DS2 in the context of HLA-C*0304 
in tetramer binding or Vav1 phosphorylation assays (Fig. 3, F and 
G). To generate a positive control peptide for this experiment, we 
tested P7 and P8 derivatives of the naturally processed HLA-C*0304–
binding peptide, GAVDPLLAL, guided by our current work and 
also that of Liu et al. (13, 24). GAVDPLLAL, GAVDPLAWL, and 
GAVDPLATL all stabilized HLA-C*0304, but only GAVDPLAWL in-
duced binding of the KIR2DS2 tetramer to HLA-C*0304 and Vav1 
phosphorylation (Fig. 3, E to G). Thus, KIR2DS2 has a broad peptide/
HLA-C specificity, and it is likely that there are other HCV peptides 
that can be presented by HLA-C*0304 and recognized by KIR2DS2.
LNP is a highly conserved peptide
HCV is an RNA virus with high sequence variability due to a lack of 
a proofreading capability of its RNA polymerase. We therefore as-
sessed whether there was a clinical correlate to the defective replication 
of replicons with LNP variants. We observed that the LNP epitope 
is highly conserved across HCV genotypes, which, in general, differ 
by up to 30% in sequence identity (table S2). Genotype 5 HCV, the 
only genotype with a consistent variation of this epitope, has a leucine- 
to-phenylalanine variant at P9, consistent with our finding in the 
replication assays that variation at P9 of the LNP epitope does not 
affect HCV replication. Furthermore, the LNP epitope is conserved 
across 878 (98.5%) of the 891 HCV NS3 sequences deposited in the 
Los Alamos HCV database (http://hcv.lanl.gov). Thus, a lack of nat-
ural variation in this region implies that, in vivo, mutation of LNP 
is relatively poorly tolerated and marks it as a viable target for a non-
rearranging immune receptor. Furthermore, structural analysis demon-
strates that LNP is located within the RNA helicase domain of the 
HCV NS3 protein in the Ia motif and that the LNP peptide is in the 
RNA binding region of this motif, consistent with its relative lack of 
variation (25). Thus, it is in a critical functional region of HCV.
To investigate whether KIR2DS2 was associated with the outcome 
of HCV infection on a genetic basis, we performed logistic regression 
analysis of putative activating KIR/HLA combinations (KIR2DS1:HLA- 
C2, 
KIR2DS2:HLA-A*11, KIR2DS2:HLA-C1, and KIR3DS1:HLA-BBw4) and 
control activating KIR/HLA combinations (KIR2DS1:HLA-C1 and 
KIR2DS2:HLA-C2), together with key protective (KIR2DL3:HLA-C1 
homozygosity) and susceptibility (KIR2DS3) factors in our UK Cauca-
sian population with resolved (n = 120) or chronic (n = 216) HCV in-
fection (4). KIR2DS2, in combination with HLA-C1, was protective

against chronic HCV infection [P = 0.033; odds ratio (OR), 2.06; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 1.06 to 4.02], but no association was found 
between KIR2DS2 in combination with HLA-A*11 and the outcome 
of HCV infection (Table 1). We also noted that KIR3DS1 in combi-
nation with HLA-BBw4 was protective, but none of the control com-
binations were associated with the outcome of HCV infection. Thus, 
in HCV infection, group 1 HLA-C alleles are protective in combina-
tion with both KIR A (KIR2DL3) and KIR B (KIR2DS2) centromeric 
haplotypes.

with HUH7 cells incubated in the absence of NKL cells. The means and SEs of three experiments performed in duplicate and P values for comparisons between NKL-2DS2 
and NKL-2DL2 are shown. (D) NKL, NKL-2DL2, or NKL-2DS2 cells were cocultured with HUH7-C*0304 cells expressing either wild-type (left) or the L9D mutant HCV replicon

such as Zika virus (ZIKV), dengue virus (DENV), yellow fever virus 
(YFV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), and West Nile virus (WNV). 
Similar to HCV, these viruses all encode an RNA helicase belonging 
to superfamily 2 as a C-terminal domain of the NS3 protein (26). How-
ever, because the LNP peptide is not conserved among these viruses, 
we sought additional HLA-C*0102–binding peptides that may en-
gage KIR2DS2. We screened the viral genomes from these viruses 
using NetMHCpan 2.8 and a percentage rank cutoff for binding of 
2. We identified putative HLA-C*0102–binding peptides from the 
helicases of these viruses that had both the HLA-C*0102–binding 
motif and the “AT” KIR2DS2-binding motif (table S3). These pep-
tides all contained a highly conserved “MCHAT” sequence from the 
NS3 Ib motif that is completely conserved among 61 of 63 viruses 
within the genus Flavivirus regardless of the species tropism of the 
virus (Fig. 4 and table S4). Using a BLAST search (https://blast.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi), this sequence is not found intact within the 
human genome.
KIR2DS2 recognizes conserved peptides from  
flaviviral helicases
We then assessed KIR2DS2 binding to peptides containing this conserved 
MCHAT peptide motif. We identified representative peptides from key 
human pathogens including ZIKV and DENV [IVDLMCHATF: both 
ZIKV NS3255–264 (BAP47441.1) and DENV NS3256–265 (ACK57817.1)], 
YFV [VIDAMCHATL: YFV NS3255–264 (AIZ07887.1)], and WNV and 
JEV [IVDVMCHATL: both WNV NS3255–264 (AFI56984.1) and JEV 
NS3255–264 (ABU94628.1)]. We used these peptides to load 721.174 cells 
and demonstrated that at 200 M in flow cytometry assays, these pep-
tides induced binding to KIR2DS2 tetramers, with enhanced binding of 
KIR2DS2 by the ZIKV and DENV peptide IVDLMCHATF (Fig. 5A).
Our binding and functional experiments all used the KIR2DS2*001 
allele, and we therefore tested whether allelic diversity of KIR affected 
KIR2DS2-mediated peptide recognition. We tested the alleles KIR2DS2*007 
and KIR2DS*008, which have polymorphisms in the ligand-binding 
domains compared with KIR2DS2*001 (27). Using a tetramer bind-
ing assay, we found that these allelic variants had a similar peptide 
specificity to KIR2DS2*001 (fig. S5). Thus, allelic diversity of KIR2DS2 
did not influence recognition of HLA-C*0102–presented peptides by 
KIR2DS2.
To determine whether these flaviviral peptides could activate NK 
cells, we tested Vav1 phosphorylation in NKL-2DS2 cells. 721.174 
cells were loaded with peptide and cocultured with NKL-2DS2 cells. 
The flaviviral peptides that bound KIR2DS2 also induced Vav1 phos-
phorylation in NKL-2DS2 cells (Fig. 5B). We next generated a 721.221 
transfectant stably expressing HLA-C*0102 and the DENV/ZIKV 
peptide IVDLMCHATF. We cocultured these cells with NKL, NKL-
2DL2, and NKL-2DS2 cells. Endogenous expression of IVDLMCHATF with 
HLA-C*0102 resulted in augmented lysis of 721.221 transfectants by 
NKL-2DS2, as compared with lysis of 721.221 expressing HLA-C*0102 
alone, but did not augment lysis by NKL or NKL-2DL2 cells (Fig. 5C).
To test the potential for KIR2DS2 to recognize native DENV, we 
used a dengue replicon system (28). The DENV genome replicates 
at a slightly lower level in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells ex-
pressing the replicon than during a wild-type virus infection but with a 
slight overexpression of protein over time (fig. S6). HEK cells stably ex-
pressing the dengue replicon were transiently transfected with HLA- 
C*0102 
or HLA-C*0304. NKL-2DS2 preferentially lysed DENV-replicating 
HEK cells transfected with HLA-C*0102, as compared with HEK:HLA- 
 
C*0102 not expressing DENV, as well as HEK cells expressing 
both DENV and HLA-C*0102 cells, as compared with those express-
ing DENV only (Fig. 5, D and E, and fig. S7). However, we did not 
observe KIR2DS2-specific lysis of HEK cells expressing DENV and 
HLA-C*0304 (Fig. 5F). Thus, in addition to HCV, KIR2DS2 also rec-
ognizes flaviviral helicase peptides in the context of HLA-C*0102.
Analysis of the crystal structures of the NS3 helicases of both HCV 
and DENV complexed with nucleic acids representative of the viral 
RNA indicates that similar to the HCV LNP epitope, the IVDLMCHATF 
peptide directly contacts the viral nucleic acid (Fig. 5G). Furthermore, 
the NS3 helicases of DENV, ZIKV, and JEV are all highly conserved, 
with this peptide occupying a similar position in all crystal structures 
(25, 29–31). Thus, KIR2DS2 recognizes highly conserved peptide mo-
tifs within the helicases of the Flaviviridae family, which are directly 
involved in RNA binding and under extreme constraints on their ability 
to mutate.
DISCUSSION
These data demonstrate that KIR2DS2 functions as an antigen-specific 
receptor that recognizes conserved peptides from the Flaviviridae 
family of viruses. We have shown that KIR2DS2 recognizes a peptide 
derived from the helicase 1a region of HCV, which is highly conserved 
among HCV genotypes, and also a conserved peptide sequence from 
Table 1. Genetic association of activating KIRs with their putative ligands and the outcome of HCV infection in 336 individuals exposed to HCV (216 
chronically infected and 120 with resolved HCV infection). Logistic regression was performed using SPSS v20.0 using the ENTER method. OR > 1 indicates

flaviviruses, including the DENV and ZIKV. All of the peptides 
have alanine and threonine at the C-terminal −1 and −2 positions, 
respectively, and within the flaviviral sequences, these two amino 
acids form part of an MCHAT motif within the helicase 1b region, 
which is conserved in 61 of 63 flaviviruses. The peptides can be en-
dogenously present by HLA-C*0102, and the combination of the 
HCV peptide LNP and HLA-C*0102 is sufficient for KIR2DS2 to in-
hibit replication in vitro. Thus, KIR2DS2 
has some functions analogous to a T cell 
receptor in recognizing peptide/MHC 
but has a broad specificity in that it also 
recognizes HLA-C*0304 and peptide 
(12). Binding to different peptides de-
rived from diverse pathogens, as well as 
to different HLA class I molecules, is a 
likely prerequisite for KIR2DS2 to reach 
its cur 
rent population frequency of about 
50%. Our experiments suggest that an ad-
ditional HCV peptide may be presented 
by HLA- 
C*0304 to KIR2DS2. However, 
further work is required to define the 
complete specificity of this receptor.
A broad specificity for KIR2DS2 is 
consistent with our understanding of how 
inhibitory KIRs engage HLA class I (10). 
The recognition of different peptides and 
HLA class I allotypes is facilitated by the 
motif-based recognition of HLA class I 
by KIR, in which the KIR/HLA interface 
is stabilized by salt bridges (32) and pep-
tide selectivity is determined by the C- 
terminal −1 and −2 residues of the peptide. 
Thus, although the HCV and DENV pep-
tides share only two residues, both are 
recognized by KIR2DS2 in the context 
of the same HLA class I molecule. This 
is consistent with the mode of binding 
observed for the HLA-C–specific inhib-
itory KIR. KIR2DS2 thus demonstrates 
similarities in binding properties to the 
inhibitory KIR but with distinct peptide 
selectivity from its inhibitory counterparts, 
KIR2DL2 and KIR2DL3. One concern is 
that a broad peptide specificity may lead 
to autoreactivity, and there is an associ-
ation of KIR2DS2 with the autoimmune 
disease systemic sclerosis and rheuma-
toid vasculitis (33, 34).
We have studied ligands for KIR2DS2 
in vitro, and analysis of our HCV popu-
lation demonstrated an in vivo correla-
tion of KIR2DS2 with the outcome of HCV 
infection. However, to date, we have not 
seen any studies that demonstrate an 
in vivo role for KIR2DS2 in flaviviral in-
fection. In an immunogenetic study, there 
was an under 
representation of KIR2DS2 
in DENV- 
infected individuals (39.0%), as 
compared with healthy controls (64.8%) 
(35), suggest 
ing a positive association of KIR2DS2 with DENV clearance. 
Furthermore, during acute DENV infection, NK cells are activated 
in vivo, but testing of KIR2DS2+ NK cells in this context is difficult 
because of the lack of specific reagents that distinguish KIR2DS2 
from KIR2DL2/3. Thus, further in vivo work is required to deter-
mine whether KIR2DS2+ NK cells are specifically activated during 
acute flaviviral infections.

servation of a KIR2DS2-binding peptide. The box indicates the putative KIR2DS2-binding peptide. Numbering is

Nonetheless, higher KIR2DS2 gene frequencies are seen in pop-
ulations from Central and Southern Africa, where flaviviral infections 
are more common (36). Furthermore, within the Amerindian pop-
ulation, both the KIR A and B haplotypes have been maintained (37). 
This balancing selection is thought to be due to the combined effects 
of the KIR B haplotype protecting against pregnancy-induced dis-
eases and the KIR A haplotype protecting against infectious diseases. 
However, the genes associated with protection against pregnancy- 
associated diseases are located in the telomeric end of the KIR locus, 
so our data are consistent with a model in which the population fre-
quency of the centromeric end of the KIR B haplotype is maintained 
through protection against infectious diseases. A broad specificity of 
KIR2DS2 for different HLA-C allotypes complexed with peptides de-
rived from a pathogenic virus provides a rationale for the evolution 
of this family of receptors. Our observations, coupled with the recent 
discoveries of adaptive properties of NK cells, make them potential 
targets for novel therapeutic strategies against flaviviral infections.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients
The cohort of HCV-exposed individuals was recruited from UK hepa-
tology clinics (4, 38). Two hundred thirty-three individuals had chronic 
HCV infection, and 128 had resolved infection. Overall, 239 (69%) 
were male, and 289 (82%) had acquired HCV through intravenous 
drug usage.
HCV replicon
The N17/JFH1 subgenomic replicon encoding the firefly luciferase 
reporter and the puromycin resistance marker has been described 
previously (21). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using the 
QuikChange II XL kit (Agilent Technologies) with appropriate prim-
ers (sequences available upon request). The N17 replicon RNAs were 
generated in vitro using the T7 Megascript kit (Applied Biosystems). 
To measure replication of N17 SGR/JFH1WT, 4 × 106 naive HUH7 
cells were electroporated with 10 g of viral RNA, cells were seeded 
in triplicate and were lysed, and luciferase activity was measured us-
ing the Bright-Glo Luciferase assay system (Promega). HUH7 cells 
electroporated with the wild type or the L9D variant of the N17 repli-
con RNA were cultured in the presence of puromycin (2 g/ml; Life 
Technologies), and the surviving cells were pooled and established 
as stable replicon-expressing cell lines.
Cell lines and transfectants
721.174 and HUH7 cells were cultured in R10 medium [RPMI 1640 
supplemented with 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies)] 
or Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) and 10% fetal calf 
serum (FCS; Lonza). HLA-C*0102 or HLA-C*0304 were cloned into the 
pIB vector (39) and transfected into the HUH7.5 cells. The HEK:DENV 
replicon cells were grown in DMEM and 10% FCS supplemented with 
puromycin (2 g/ml). The HLA-C*0304:ICP47 cell line was made 
by transfecting 721.221:C*0304 cells with the ICP47 gene cloned into 
pCDNA 3.1 using the Polyplus jetPRIME transfection system (Source 
Bioscience) and selected using hygromycin (500 g/ml; Invivogen). 
The NKL cell line was transfected with the KIR2DL2, KIR2DS2, or 
KIR2DL3 cloned into the pIB vector, as previously described.
HUH7 cell lines stably expressing the wild-type N17 replicon or the 
L9D variant described above were transduced with a pIB-HLA- 
C*0102–
expressing retroviral vector. The transduced cells were selected with 
puromycin (2 g/ml) and blasticidin (1 to 6 g/ml). HUH7:C*0102:replicon 
cells were cocultured with NKL cell lines for 24 hours at various E/T 
ratios for 24 hours, and then luciferase activity was assessed.
NK cell assays
CD107a degranulation
PBMCs were stimulated overnight with rHuIL-15 (human recom-
binant IL-15) (1 ng/ml; R&D Systems). Peptides were synthesized

(IVDL) was coexpressed with HLA-C*0102 in 721.221 cells and used as targets in cyto-

iments were performed at an E/T ratio of 6:1, and comparisons were made between 
the HLA-C*0102 transfectant and the HLA-C*0102:LNP or HLA-C*0102:IVDL cells. 
(D to F) HEK, HEK-C*0102, or HEK:C*0304 cells expressing a DENV replicon (HEK:DENV, 
HEK:C*0102:DENV, or HEK:C*0304:DENV, respectively) or not were cocultured with 
NKL cells expressing KIR2DS2 or KIR2DL2, and cytotoxicity was assessed at 24 hours. 
The effect of DENV on KIR2DS2-mediated killing is shown in (D), and the effect of 
HLA-C*0102 on KIR2DS2-mediated killing is shown in (E) and fig. S5. A comparison of 
the effect of HLA-C*0304 on killing of DENV-expressing cells with that of HLA-C*0102 
by NKL-2DS2 is shown in (F). Means and SEs of at least three independent experiments 
performed in triplicate are shown. (G) Comparison of HCV (left) and dengue NS3 heli-
cases (right) showing contact of the LNP (HCV) and IVDLMCHATF (Dengue) epitopes

epitopes are illustrated. Images were derived from structures published by Gu and 
Rice (25) and Luo et al. (29) and rendered using PyMOL. Where shown, P values were 
determined by independent two-tailed t tests (*P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, ***P < 0.001).

by GL Biochem Ltd or Peptide Protein Research. 721.174 cells were 
incubated with peptide at 26°C overnight, washed, and resuspended 
with the PBMCs at an E/T ratio of 5:1 and with anti–CD107a-AF647 
(20 l/ml). Cells were then incubated at 26°C for 4 hours with GolgiStop 
(6 g/ml; BD Biosciences) added after 1 hour before staining and analysis 
by flow cytometry.
CellTracker Orange cytotoxicity assays
721.174 cells were incubated with peptide at 26°C for 16 hours and 
then with CellTracker Orange CMTMR (Life Technologies) and re-
suspended with NK cell clones at an E/T ratio of 10:1. Cocultures 
were incubated at 26°C for 4 hours, stained with LIVE/DEAD Fix-
able Aqua Dead Cell stain (Life Technologies), and fixed in 1% (w/v) 
paraformaldehyde (PFA) before analysis by flow cytometry.
LNP construct
A construct expressing HLA-C*0102 in continuity with the 2A self- 
cleaving peptide sequence from Thosea asigna virus, the E3/19K endo-
plasmic reticulum– 
targeting sequence, and the LNP or IVDLMACHATF 
peptide was synthesized from GeneArt (Life Technologies), cloned 
into the pIB vector, and transduced into the 721.221 cell line.
Inhibition of HCV replication assays
Target cells Huh7-J17-WT/HLA and Huh7-J17-R1/HLA were seeded. 
The next day, NKLs were cocultured with the target cells in duplicate 
for 24 hours. Plates were then centrifuged, and the cell pellet was lysed 
with Glo Lysis Buffer (Promega). Fifty microliters of each lysate was 
read using 50 l of luciferase assay reagent (Promega) on a GloMax 
Discover luminometer.
HEK cell cytotoxic killing assay
HEK and HEK:DENV cells were transiently transfected with 2 g of 
C*0102mCherry-pCDNA3 or C*0304mCherry-pCDNA3 using Polyplus 
jetPRIME (Source Bioscience). After 24 hours, cells were cocul-
tured for 24 hours with NKL cell lines in triplicate at an E/T ratio 
of 6:1. Cells were stained with LIVE/DEAD Zombie Violet stain 
(BioLegend) for 1 hour, fixed with 1% PFA–phosphate-buffered sa-
line (PBS) solution, and analyzed by flow cytometry. DENV-positive 
HEK cells were detected by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) ex-
pression of the DENV construct, and HLA-C*0102– or HLA-C*0304–
transfected cell lines were detected by mCherry expression. Percent-
age cytotoxicity was determined by calculating the percentage of 
Zombie Violet–positive cells in the presence of effectors minus 
the percentage of Zombie Violet–positive cells in the absence of 
effectors.
KIR staining
The extracellular domain of KIR2DS2*001 or KIR2DL2*001 con-
taining a C-terminal biotinylation tag was cloned into the pET23d+ 
vector. This was expressed as inclusion bodies in Rosetta 2 (DE3) 
bacteria (Merck Millipore), purified, denatured, and reduced in 6 M 
guanidine-HCl and 20 mM dithiothreitol. KIR2DS2 was purified by 
gel filtration chromatography using fast protein liquid chromatog-
raphy. Biotinylation was performed using a BirA biotinylation kit 
(Avidity). Fluorescently labeled tetramers were produced by cou-
pling biotinylated KIR2DS2 molecules to PE-conjugated streptavi-
din (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies). The KIR2DS2*007 and 
KIR2DS2*008 tetramers were made from a KIR2DS2*001 template 
using the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit 
(Agilent Technologies) (primer sequences are available upon request). 
The KIR2DL2-IgG fusion construct (KIR2DL2-Fc Chimera, R&D 
Systems) was conjugated with protein A Alexa Fluor 488 (Life 
Technologies).
KIR genotyping
KIR genotyping of the donors was performed by quantitative poly-
merase chain reaction (qPCR), as previously described (4).
NK cell clones
NK cells (CD3− CD56+ CD158b+) were single cell–sorted from 
PBMCs from a KIR2DL2+S2+L3− donor into stem cell growth medium 
(CellGenix) containing 5% heat-inactivated human serum and 
IL-12 (10 ng/ml; PeproTech), IL-15 (20 ng/ml; R&D Systems), and 
IL-18 (100 ng/ml; R&D Systems). Clones were fed weekly with irra-
diated PBMCs (1 × 106/ml), IL-2 (250 IU/ml), and phytohemaggluti-
nin (2.5 g/ml; Thermo Fischer Scientific). Clones were typed for 
expression of KIR2DS2 by reverse transcription qPCR. RNA was 
extracted from the NK clones using TRIzol (Life Technologies) and 
reverse-transcribed using a high-capacity reverse transcriptase kit 
(Applied Biosystems). One nanogram of complementary DNA was 
used for qPCR analysis. KIR2DS2, KIR2DL2, and KIR2DL3 primers 
and probes were as previously described (40). Each sample was read 
in triplicate, and gene expression was determined using the Ct 
method.
Conjugate formation and staining
721.174 cells were incubated overnight at 26°C in the absence or pres-
ence of 100 M peptide. Ba/F3-KIR2DS2 or Ba/F3-KIR2DL2 cells 
(1 × 105; a gift from L. Lanier) were co-incubated with the 721.174 
cells at an E/T ratio of 2:1. Cells were fixed in 4% (w/v) PFA in PBS 
and then stained with CD158b-PE (GL183) antibody (20 g/ml; 
Beckman Coulter). Cells were imaged using a Leica SP5 resonance 
scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems). Transmission images and 
PE emission were collected in different channels. Data were pro-
cessed using Leica Imaging software and ImageJ software (http://
imagej.nih.gov/ij).
Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting
721.174 cells were cultured with 20 mM peptide overnight at 26°C. 
NKL-2DS2 and 721.174 cells were co-incubated at an E/T ratio of 
1:1 for 5 min at 37°C and lysed in 20 mM tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM 
NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, and 0.5% Triton 
X-100. KIRs were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD158b (clone 
GL183, AbD Serotec) and analyzed by Western blotting. Antibodies 
recognizing phospho-Vav1 (EP510Y, Abcam), Vav1 (Cell Signaling 
Technology), anti-phosphotyrosine (4G10 Platinum, Millipore), and 
DAP-12 (clone D7G1X; Cell Signaling Technology) were used with 
horseradish peroxidase–conjugated secondary antibodies (Cell 
Signaling Technology). Membranes were stripped using the West-
ern Blot Recycling kit (Alpha Diagnostics). Protein bands were 
detected by chemiluminescence (SuperSignal West Pico Chemi-
luminescent Substrate, Perbio Science) using the ChemiDoc-It Imaging 
system with VisionWorks software (UVP) and quantified with ImageJ 
software.
Peptide binding analysis
The online resources ADT, NetMHCpan, and KISS were used to search 
for potential HLA-C*0102–binding epitopes (41–43).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses (t tests and ANOVA) were performed using GraphPad 
Prism version 6, and logistic regression analysis was performed using 
SPSS v20.0 (IBM).
