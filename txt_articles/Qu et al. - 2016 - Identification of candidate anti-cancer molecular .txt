ABSTRACT
Compound Kushen Injection (CKI) has been clinically used in China for over 
15 years to treat various types of solid tumours. However, because such Traditional 
Chinese Medicine (TCM) preparations are complex mixtures of plant secondary 
metabolites, it is essential to explore their underlying molecular mechanisms in a 
systematic fashion. We have used the MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line as an initial 
in vitro model to identify CKI induced changes in gene expression. Cells were treated 
with CKI for 24 and 48 hours at two concentrations (1 and 2 mg/mL total alkaloids), 
and the effect of CKI on cell proliferation and apoptosis were measured using XTT 
and Annexin V/Propidium Iodide staining assays respectively. Transcriptome data of 
cells treated with CKI or 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for 24 and 48 hours were subsequently 
acquired using high-throughput Illumina RNA-seq technology. In this report we show 
that CKI inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent 
fashion. We integrated and applied a series of transcriptome analysis methods, 
including gene differential expression analysis, pathway over-representation analysis, 
de novo identification of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNA) as well as co-expression 
network reconstruction, to identify candidate anti-cancer molecular mechanisms of 
CKI. Multiple pathways were perturbed and the cell cycle was identified as the potential 
primary target pathway of CKI in MCF-7 cells. CKI may also induce apoptosis in MCF-7 
cells via a p53 independent mechanism. In addition, we identified novel lncRNAs and 
showed that many of them might be expressed as a response to CKI treatment.
INTRODUCTION
The complexity of carcinogenesis at the genetic 
level has been investigated more and more deeply by 
leveraging fast-developing omics-related techniques 
in the past decades [1–3]. Novel genetic mutations and 
molecular markers are now comprehensively identified 
in cancer genome sequencing projects. More importantly, 
whole transcriptome analyses are much more widely used 
to identify novel cancer-related transcripts or regulatory 
elements, such as long non-protein-coding RNAs 
(lncRNAs) and alternative splicing, and are also used to 
characterise the underlying molecular mechanisms based 
on global gene expression changes in different types of 
cancers in vivo or in vitro [4–6]. The current challenge is 
to integrate these new techniques to discover or evaluate 
novel cancer therapies [7].
Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCMs) are 
experience-based remedies derived from hundreds or 
thousands of years of clinical use in China. Most TCMs 
are extracted from one or more medicinal herbs. The 
existence of multiple bioactive ingredients makes many 
TCMs potential novel resources for the discovery of new 
cancer drugs, such as multi-targeted cancer drugs [8].

injection) is a State Administration of Chinese Medicine-

approved TCM formula used in the clinical treatment of 
various types of cancers in China [9, 10]. It is extracted 
from the roots of two medicinal herbs, Kushen (Radix 
Sophorae Flavescentis) and Baituling (Rhizoma smilacis 
Glabrae), using modern standardised Good Manufacturing 
Processes (GMP) [11, 12]. The chemical fingerprint 
of CKI contains at least 8 different components, with 
primary compounds Matrine and Oxymatrine [12]. This 
indicates that multiple compounds in CKI may deliver an 
integrated anti-tumor effect through multiple targets and 
their associated molecular pathways.
By detecting the expression of key genes or proteins 
in single molecular pathways, the anti-tumor effects 
of Matrine or Oxymatrine, including the inhibition of 
cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis, have been 
demonstrated in various types of cancer [13–17]. The 
molecular mechanisms of CKI as a system have also 
been recently explored [11, 18]. Quantitative detection 
of expression changes of key regulators, including beta-
catenin, CyclinD1 and c-Myc, of the canonical Wnt/
beta-catenin pathway, have shown that CKI can suppress 
the stem cells in MCF-7 cells by down-regulating this 
signalling pathway [11]. In addition, other studies suggest 
that CKI can inhibit mouse sarcoma growth and reduce 
tumor-induced hyperalgesia via the AKT and TRPV1 
signalling pathways by reducing the phosphorylation of 
ERK and AKT kinases and BAD [18].
The main goal of modern pharmacology is to 
elucidate the molecular mechanisms that can be targeted 
by therapeutic compounds. Analyses using purified 
single components of TCM can be somewhat useful, 
but are limited when it comes to identifying integrated 
systemic effects resulting from a multi-compound 
formula. Furthermore, previous studies attempting to 
understand the mode of action of CKI have only focused 
on single or a few molecular pathways by assessing the 
expression of key regulators in these pathways. We have 
therefore, taken advantage of high throughput whole 
transcriptome analyses, and applied these to explore the 
system wide molecular mechanisms targeted by TCM. 
We have identified a comprehensive list of expressed 
genes perturbed by CKI, and used gene expression data 
to characterise molecular pathways potentially targeted 
by CKI in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. Our results 
show that CKI can alter the expression of many cancer 
relevant genes and lncRNAs, correlated with the inhibition 
of cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest and the 
induction of apoptosis via p53 independent pathways.
RESULTS
CKI inhibits MCF-7 cell proliferation and 
induces cell apoptosis
To characterise the effect of CKI on proliferation 
of MCF-7 breast cancer cells, we used the XTT assay to 
measure cell viability after treating with different doses of 
CKI. The proliferation of MCF-7 cells was dramatically 
inhibited when treated with a high dose of CKI (2 mg/
mL, based on the total alkaloid concentration in CKI) 
and showed a dose-dependent effect (Figure 1A and 
Supplementary Figure 1A). An Annexin V/Propidium 
Iodide (PI) assay was used to quantify cell apoptosis 
when MCF-7 cells were treated with CKI. Percentage of 
apoptotic cells, particularly at the higher dose of CKI, was 
increased at both time points compared with untreated 
cells, indicating that apoptosis was induced in cells treated 
with CKI (Figure 1B and 1C). The caspase3/7 colorimetric 
assay also showed that there was increased caspase3/7 
activity in cells treated with CKI (Supplementary Figure 
1B). Altogether, these results showed that CKI could 
inhibit growth and induce apoptosis of MCF-7 cells in 
vitro.
Global gene expression changes in MCF-7 cells 
treated with CKI
To further investigate the underlying molecular 
mechanisms of CKI on MCF-7 cells, we performed 
high-depth next generation sequencing using an Illumina 
HiSeq 2500. In total, more than 732 million stranded 100 
basepairs (bp) paired-end reads were sequenced from 9 
groups of MCF-7 cells treated with two doses of CKI or 
one dose of chemotherapy drug 5-Fluorouracil (5-FU) for 
24 and 48 hours along with untreated cells (Supplementary 
Table 1) (GSE78512). The global gene expression profiles 
of CKI treated cells, particularly in cells treated with high 
dose CKI (2 mg/mL), were clearly different from the 
profile of 5-FU treated cells compared with untreated cells 
(Supplementary Figure 2). We then used edgeR to identify 
the statistically significant differentially expressed (DE) 
genes for the pairwise comparisons between cells treated 
with 1 mg/mL CKI, 2 mg/mL CKI and 5-FU for 24 or 48 
hours respectively (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 2). 
Compared with untreated cells, fewer than 200 genes had 
significantly altered expression in cells treated with low 
dose CKI (1 mg/mL) for 24 or 48 hours (Figure 2A and 2B). 
However, many more DE genes (1,826 genes for 24 hours 
and 2,904 for 48 hours) were identified in cells treated with 
high dose CKI (2 mg/mL). Interestingly, when comparing 
the number of DE genes in cells treated with high dose CKI 
with low dose CKI, we observed almost twice as many 
genes down-regulated but only a small number of genes 
(828 to 791) up-regulated (Figure 2A and 2B). Furthermore, 
we compared DE genes in cells treated with high dose CKI 
and in cells treated with 5-FU (Supplementary Figure 3). 
For up-regulated genes in cells treated with high dose CKI 
for 24 hours, approximately half (396 out of 791) of these 
were also identified as DE genes, with most (384) being up-
regulated in 5-FU treated cells as well. 459 down-regulated 
genes were also shown as DE genes with most of these (424 
out of 459) also being down-regulated in cells treated with 
5- FU for 24 hours (Supplementary Figure 3A). After cells 
were treated with CKI or 5-FU for 48 hours, the number

of DE genes decreased dramatically in 5-FU treated cells, 
but greatly increased in cells treated with 2 mg/mL CKI 
(Supplementary Figure 3B). The common DE genes altered 
by CKI or 5-FU showed consistent expression changes at 
48 hours (Supplementary Figure 3B).
To validate the gene expression changes from 
transcriptome analysis, we performed quantitative PCR 
(qPCR) for 6 genes and acquired overall consistent results 
(Figure 2C, Supplementary Figure 4 and Supplementary 
Table 2).
Annotation of the molecular pathways altered by 
CKI in MCF-7 cells
Since CKI likely contains multiple bioactive 
ingredients, we used a number of systems biology methods 
to explore the molecular mechanisms of CKI.
The over-represented Gene Ontology (GO) terms for 
all DE genes identified in cells treated with high dose CKI 
(2 mg/mL) for 24 hour and 48 hours are shown in Figure 
3A and 3B. Based on their functional similarity, these 
GO terms were clustered into several primary categories, 
including “Regulation of biological process, cellular 
process and metabolic process”, “Cell differentiation, 
development”, “Transport, localisation”, “Chromatin 
organisation, organelle organisation”, “Cell motility and 
migration” and “Secondary metabolic processes and 
reactive oxygen species metabolic”. Interestingly, we 
found that the majority of cell growth or proliferation 
related GO terms included more down-regulated genes, 
while GO terms associated with “Secondary metabolic 
processes and reactive oxygen species metabolic” showed 
enrichment of more up-regulated genes (Figure 3A). 
In MCF-7 cells treated with CKI for 48 hours, similar 
categories of over-represented GO terms seen at 24 
hours were also observed, such as “Metabolic process”, 
“Regulation of metabolic process” and “Localization”. In 
addition, cell proliferation related terms, including “Cell 
cycle”, “Cell growth” and “Cell death” were also over-
represented in DE genes from cells treated with CKI for 
48 hours (Figure 3B). Furthermore, we compared the over-
representation of GO terms of the 200 most significantly

DE genes in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU for 24 hours 
or 48 hours (Figure 3C and 3D). In cells treated with CKI 
or 5-FU for 24 hours, over-represented GO terms were 
generally divided into two clusters with respect to the 
different expression status of the genes that contributed 
to each term. Terms such as “Cellular hormone metabolic 
process” and “Pigment metabolic process” were dominated 
by up-regulated genes, which were mainly DE genes 
from CKI treated cells only. On the other hand, terms 
represented by “Chromosome segregation”, “Cell cycle”,

“Meiotic nuclear division” and “Somatic diversification 
of immune receptors”, were mainly contributed by down-
regulated genes, particularly DE genes from 5-FU treated 
cells. After 48 hours, the same over-represented GO terms 
in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU for 24 hours were found, 
but the proportions of DE genes from cells treated with 
CKI were increased for most of these terms, particularly 
for “Chromosome segregation” related terms. In addition, 
more significantly over-represented GO terms were found 
in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU for 48 hours compared 
to those in 24 hours, such as “Regulation of viral process” 
and “Negative regulation of intracellular transport”, and 
the majority of DE genes that contributed to these terms 
were down-regulated in cells treated with CKI.
In order to further characterise the potential 
functional pathways altered by CKI, we performed over-
representation analysis of Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes 
and Genomes (KEGG) pathways for all DE genes in 
cells treated with high dose CKI. Metabolic pathways 
represented by “Steroid hormone biosynthesis”, and 
including “Pentose and glucuronate interconversions” 
and “Drug metabolism” and so on, were over-represented 
based on DE genes in cells treated with CKI for 24 hours 
(Figure 4A). The majority of DE genes that contributed 
to these terms were up-regulated (Figure 4A). Over-
represented cell growth related pathways, such as “Cell 
cycle” and “DNA replication”, were also observed 
(Figure 4A). In addition, cancer-related pathways, such as 
“Prostate cancer”, “Bladder cancer” and “MicroRNA in 
cancer”, were also shown as over-represented pathways. 
It is also interesting to note that DE genes that contributed 
to cell growth and cancer related pathways were generally

genes between these cut offs, and the node size is proportional to the significance of over-representation. Terms with similar functional

down-regulated in cells treated with CKI (Figure 4A). 
After cells were treated with CKI for 48 hours, most of 
the over-represented pathways found at 24 hours were still 
shown as significantly over-represented. However, some 
over-represented metabolic pathways and disease-related 
pathways at 48 hours were not shown as significantly 
over-represented pathways in cells treated with CKI for 
24 hours. These pathways included “Arginine and proline 
metabolism”, “Pyrimidine metabolism”, “Fructose 
and mannose metabolism”, “Parkinson’s disease” and 
“Alzheimer’s disease”. In contrast to over-represented 
metabolic or disease related pathways in cells treated with 
CKI for 24 hours, these 48-hours-only significant over-
represented metabolic or disease pathways were mostly a 
function of down-regulated DE genes (Figure 4B). Next, 
we compared the over-represented KEGG pathways based 
on the top 200 significantly DE genes in cells treated with 
CKI or 5-FU. Consistent with the results in Figure 4A and 
4B, metabolic related pathways were primarily contributed 
by CKI up-regulated genes. Cell growth and cancer related 
pathways were also over-represented, and were mostly 
contributed by down-regulated genes in cells treated with 
CKI or 5-FU (Figure 4C and 4D). More significantly over-
represented cancer-related pathways were found in cells 
treated with CKI or 5-FU after 48 hours, and DE genes in 
these pathways were mainly down-regulated (Figure 4D).
Many pathways perturbed by CKI in MCF-7 
cells were inhibited
From the above gene set enrichment analysis, we 
observed that many over-represented GO terms or KEGG

pathways were enriched in down-regulated genes from 
cells treated with CKI. We used Signalling Pathway 
Impact Analysis (SPIA) to identify significantly perturbed 
functional pathways when integrating gene expression 
information with signalling pathway topology [19]. 21 
KEGG pathways were identified as significantly perturbed 
in cells treated with high dose CKI (2 mg/mL) after 24 
hours, and the majority of these pathways (16 out of 21) 
were shown as inhibited (Supplementary Table 3). In cells 
treated with 5-FU for 24 hours, more KEGG pathways 
(75) were identified as significantly perturbed, but only 
22 of these were shown as inhibited (Supplementary 
Table 3). We then compared these significantly perturbed 
pathways in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU. Interestingly, 
all significantly altered pathways in cells treated with CKI 
were also shown as significantly perturbed in cells treated 
with 5-FU (Figure 5A). This suggests that at 24 hours, CKI 
and 5-FU perturbed some of the same pathways. However, 
the perturbation status of these common altered pathways 
in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU was quite different. The 
majority of inhibited pathways in cells treated with CKI 
were shown as activated in cells treated with 5-FU (Figure 
5A). Although the perturbation status indicated by SPIA is 
just suggestive, it still provides some clues that CKI might 
target different genes even though it might perturb the 
same pathway as 5-FU. After cells were treated with CKI 
or 5-FU for 48 hours, 11 significantly perturbed pathways 
were identified in each of treatment group, but only 3 of 
these were shown as significantly perturbed pathways in 
both cells treated with CKI or 5-FU (Figure 5B).
In order to examine the perturbation of CKI on 
KEGG pathways at the individual gene level, we mapped 
the expression status of DE genes in cells treated with 
CKI or 5-FU on the cell growth and death related pathway 
“Cell cycle” as an example (Figure 6). Consistent with 
what we observed in the above KEGG over-representation 
analyses, the majority of DE genes in the “Cell cycle” 
pathway were down-regulated both in cells treated with 
CKI or 5-FU. Many essential regulators, such as Cyclin-
dependent kinase 2 (CDK2), Transcription Factor 
Dp-1 (DP-1), Origin recognition complex (ORC) and 
Minichromosome maintenance protein complex (MCM) 
families, which are important in regulation of the G1/S 
transition [20, 21], were significantly down-regulated 
both in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU. However, some 
key regulators in this “Cell cycle” pathway had different 
expression status in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU. 
For example, CCND1, which encodes Cyclin-D1 (a 
member of the CycD protein family), was significantly 
down-regulated in cells treated with CKI compared with 
untreated cells. In contrast, CCND3, encoding Cyclin-D3 
which also belongs to the CycD protein family, was 
significantly up-regulated in cells treated with 5-FU. 
Interestingly, as an important pro-apoptosis modulator, 
the expression of p53 was opposite in cells treated with 
CKI (down-regulated) or 5-FU (up-regulated) compared 
to untreated cells. In addition, the protein levels of p53 
were significantly decreased in cells treated with CKI for 
24 hours and showed no significant change at 48 hours. In 
contrast p53 increased in cells treated with 5-FU for both 
24 and 48 hours (Figure 6C). Taken together the results 
of down-regulated p53 mRNA and protein levels (Figure 
2C and 6C) but elevated apoptosis activity (Figure 1B) 
in MCF-7 cells treated with CKI, suggest that CKI may 
induce cell apoptosis in a p53 independent fashion. In cells 
treated with CKI or 5-FU for 48 hours, essential genes 
for G1/S transition (as discussed above) were still shown 
as significantly down-regulated. In addition, more genes, 
such as Cyclin A1 (CCNA1, encoding CycA), Cyclin B1 
and B2 (CCNB1 and CCNB2, encoding CycB), Mitotic 
Arrest Deficient 1 (MAD1, encoding mad1) and Mitotic 
Arrest Deficient 2 (MAD2, encoding mad2), which are 
important regulators of G2 or M phase, were shown as 
significantly down-regulated in cells treated with CKI for 
48 hours.
The cell cycle assay using flow cytometry indicated 
that proportions of cells in G1 and S phases were 
significantly lower in MCF-7 cells treated with high dose 
CKI (2 mg/mL), while significantly higher in G2/M phase, 
indicating a cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase by CKI in MCF-
7 cells (Supplementary Figure 5). In summary, possible p53 
independent apoptosis together with perturbation of other 
cancer cell growth associated pathways, such as “Cell 
cycle”, probably contribute the anti-cancer effect of CKI.
The expression of many clinically relevant 
cancer genes was altered in MCF-7 cells treated 
with CKI
To investigate the potential molecular targets of CKI 
in MCF-7 cells, we examined the changes in expression 
of 135 genes in a curated database of Tumour Alterations 
Relevant for Genomics-driven Therapy (TARGET) from 
The Broad Institute (https://www.broadinstitute.org/
cancer/cga/target). These genes are directly linked to a 
clinical outcome when somatically altered in cancer. Many 
genes showed similar expression changes in cells treated 
with CKI or 5-FU, and this confirmed what we observed 
in the pathway analysis (see above) (Figure 7A). However, 
the expression of some genes was either of a higher 
degree or in a different direction in cells treated with CKI 
compared with cells treated with 5-FU. For example, ETS 
translocation variant 4 (ETV4), whose overexpression 
is oncogenic in prostate cells [22], was greatly down-
regulated in cells treated with CKI compared with cells 
treated with 5-FU. On the other hand, Cyclin-Dependent 
Kinase Inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, also named as p21) was 
highly up-regulated in 5-FU treated cells but not in CKI 
treated cells. We then examined how many significantly 
DE genes in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU were also 
in this TARGET gene list. In total, 27 DE genes in cells 
treated with CKI for 24 hours were in the TARGET gene

list, and more up-regulated genes (18 compared to 2) in 
cells treated with 5-FU for 24 hours were in the TARGET 
gene list (Figure 7B). In cells treated with CKI or 5-FU for 
48 hours, 28 DE genes were in the TARGET list from cells 
treated with CKI, while only 6 of the DE genes from cells 
treated with 5-FU for 48 hours were in this list (Figure 
7C).
Figure 5: Perturbation of KEGG pathways in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU for A. 24 hours or B. 48 hours inferred with 
SPIA. Perturbation accumulation and significance of perturbation for each KEGG pathway were calculated based on the fold changes 
of expression of DE genes compared to untreated cells, integrated with the topology information in this pathway. Positive perturbation 
accumulation values mean this pathway is activated and vice versa. “5-FU only” or “CKI only” represent pathways that are only significantly 
perturbed in one condition not in the other.

Reconstruction of non-coding and protein-coding 
RNA co-expression networks altered by CKI
The differential expression analysis of refGenes 
showed that lncRNA, H19, was significantly down-
regulated after cells were treated with CKI (Figure 2C and 
Supplementary Table 2). In order to better understand the 
potential expression change of lncRNAs in response to CKI 
in MCF-7 cancer cells, we carried out de novo identification 
of lncRNAs from this transcriptome dataset. In total, 2,576 
lncRNA transcripts, which are from 2,287 unique genomic 
loci, were identified (Supplementary Figure 6). We also 
found that the majority of these lncRNAs were novel by 
comparing the genomic coordinates of these lncRNAs with 
two well-annotated human lncRNA datasets (Figure 8A) 
[23, 24]. The expression of many lncRNAs was changed in 
cells treated with CKI or 5-FU (Figure 8B). The expression 
of lncRNAs in cells treated with CKI for 24 hours was 
quite different compared with cells treated with 5-FU for 
24 hours. While at 48 hours, we observed more similar 
lncRNA expression in cells treated with CKI or 5-FU 
(Figure 8B). These results indicate that some of these 
lncRNAs may play specific regulatory roles responding to 
different reagent treatments.
In order to identify potential lncRNA candidates 
that were highly relevant to CKI treatment in MCF-
7 cells, we reconstructed the co-expression networks 
for 15,115 detectable refGenes and 2,287 lncRNAs in 
9 different samples. 53 co-expression modules were 
reconstructed based on the expression profiles of refGenes 
or lncRNAs across 9 samples (Supplementary Figure 7 
and Supplementary Table 4). Upon examination of the 
eigengene expression patterns of these 53 modules, we 
found three modules with expression profiles that were 
consistent with CKI-specific modules (Figure 8C and 
Supplementary Figure 8). Centrality analysis of these

cells stained with anti-p53 where MFI of isotype control was subtracted. Data are represented as mean ±SEM (n=9). Statistical analyses 
were performed using t-test comparing with “untreated” (**p<0.01, ***p<0.001, ****p<0.0001). The bottom panel shows representative 
histograms of anti-p53 staining.

CKI-specific co-expression modules allowed us to identify 
“hub” nodes, many of which belonged to lncRNAs (Figure 
8D and Supplementary Figure 8). These results showed 
that lncRNAs may be co-regulated or involved in the 
same regulatory pathways with protein-coding genes when 
MCF-7 cells  are treated with CKI. We then performed GO 
and KEGG over-representation analysis for the protein-
coding genes in these three CKI-specific modules, and 
“Cell proliferation” was identified as the most significantly 
over-represented functional term (Table 1). Interestingly, 
we also found genes in these CKI-specific co-expression 
modules are over-represented in functions involved in 
“intracellular signal cascade” and “second-messenger-
mediated signaling” (Table 1), which might be triggered 
by the multiple molecular species present in CKI. In 
addition, we also identified three co-expression modules, 
which showed highly correlated co-expression profiles in 
both cells treated with CKI or 5-FU. We defined these as 
“CKI-5FU” modules (Supplementary Figure 9). These 
modules contained over-represented genes in “cell cycle”, 
“DNA replication” and other cell growth related pathways 
(Supplementary Table 5). This result was consistent with 
what we observed in our DE analysis (see above).
DISCUSSION
Many TCMs or other herbal medicines, such as CKI 
used in this study, are extracted from multiple medicinal 
herbs. The fact that multiple potentially bioactive 
ingredients are present in these formulas suggests that 
they have multiple targets, and therefore perturb multiple 
biological pathways. Transcriptome analysis using high-
throughput next generation sequencing technologies has 
been widely used in cancer biology for the identification 
of novel biomarkers, mutations and even novel transcripts, 
such as lncRNAs, in different cancer types [4, 5, 25, 26]. 
We have used whole transcriptome analysis to identify 
potential molecular mechanisms of CKI in vitro. We 
not only identified potential gene targets of CKI based

on differential gene expression, but also characterised 
potential biological pathways targeted by CKI. Although 
further experiments are required to validate these candidate 
targets, our results provide a very important starting point 
for subsequent experimental functional validation.
We have identified genes whose expression was 
significantly altered in MCF-7 cells treated with CKI. 
Consistent with the phenotypic analyses, the global gene 
expression changes in cells treated with CKI support a 
dose-dependent effect on MCF-7 cells, which had been

reported in MCF-7 stem cells and other types of cancer 
cells in previous studies [10, 11]. However, we have 
generated a far more comprehensive candidate gene list 
by considering CKI as a whole rather than looking at 
the effect of individual constituents. As expected, genes, 
including Cytochrome P450 family 1 (CYP1A1), Aldo-
Keto Reductase Family 1, Member C2 (AKR1C2) and 
Member C3 (AKR1C3), which are involved in xenobiotic 
compound metabolism, were significantly up-regulated 
when cells were treated with CKI [27, 28] but not with 
5-FU. On the other hand, many genes involved in cell 
growth or used as biomarkers of carcinogenesis, such 
as CCND1 [29], were significantly down-regulated. 
Interestingly, we observed one lncRNA H19, known to 
be over-expressed in several types of cancer [30, 31], 
was dramatically down-regulated in cells treated with 
CKI. Recently, many lncRNAs have been characterised 
as important gene regulators in various types or stages of 
carcinogenesis [32]. We hypothesise that lncRNAs may 
be also involved in the gene regulatory networks altered 
by CKI in MCF-7 cells. Whether lncRNAs are primary 
targets or secondary links to regulated pathway, still 
requires further study. Compared to traditional single-gene 
analyses used to understand the molecular mechanisms of 
TCM, transcriptome screening has significant advantages 
for identifying potential target genes.
Carcinogenesis is a complex cellular process 
involving multiple genetic alterations that perturb 
different biological processes or pathways [33]. By 
screening transcriptome-wide gene expression changes 
in vitro, one can do more than the mere identification of 
molecular markers for cancer diagnosis or therapy, one 
can also provide useful evidence to better characterise 
the underlying mechanisms of drug effects on cancer 
at pathway or network levels [34, 35]. Using whole 
transcriptome analysis, we identified multiple potential 
molecular pathways altered by CKI in MCF-7 cells. 
Cell growth related pathways, such as cell cycle, cell 
division, DNA replication and so on, were significantly 
altered in MCF-7 cells treated with CKI. By integrating 
the expression data and topologic information of genes 
involved in these pathways, it appears that cell cycle arrest 
might be one of the primary anti-tumour mechanisms of 
CKI in MCF-7 cells. As expected, 5-FU also significantly 
altered these cell growth related pathways, as reported in 
previous studies [36, 37]. However, when we consider the 
expression change of individual genes in these pathways, 
we found that many different genes were significantly 
altered by CKI or 5-FU, but the overall perturbation 
status of these pathways was consistent. We also 
noticed that CKI and 5-FU had opposite effects on some 
pathways, such as the p53 signalling pathway. Although 
the expression of the key p53 gene in the p53 signalling 
pathway was significantly down-regulated in cells treated 
with CKI, we still observed changes in the expression of 
down-stream genes in the apoptosis pathway, such as Bcl-
2. Bcl-2 is an important anti-apoptotic gene [38], which 
was significantly down-regulated in CKI treated cells,

indicating that MCF-7 cells still underwent apoptosis 
when treated with CKI. The down-regulation of Bcl-2 had 
been reported in other types of cancer cells treated with 
Matrine or Oxymatrine, two of the major components of 
CKI [16, 39–41]. Taking into account the results from the 
apoptosis assay, we propose that CKI may induce MCF-
7 cell apoptosis via p53 independent pathways. As CKI 
is normally clinically used in combination with other 
cancer chemotherapies, our results also provide primary 
molecular evidence for this potential simultaneous effect 
in clinical usage [11].
Advances in omics technologies have allowed the 
development of new cancer therapies [42]. Improved gene 
therapies, such as targeted cancer therapies or precision 
medicine, are attracting more and more attention as 
a result of improved abilities to characterise cancer 
mechanisms in individual patients [42, 43]. On the other 
hand, therapies involving whole body system modulation, 
such as immunotherapy [44] and multiply-targeted 
therapies [45], are also proposed as potentially effective 
or complementary weapons for cancer treatment [46]. The 
nature of many TCMs or ancient medicines that include 
multiple bioactive ingredients, suggests that they can be a 
rich resource for identifying or developing multi-targeted 
cancer drugs [47]. However, most TCMs or ancient 
medicines are experience-based medicines developed 
from a long history of clinical use and little is known of 
their molecular modes of action. Classical pharmacology 
has used a reductionist strategy of purification and testing 
of single components from TCM, but this limits our 
understanding of the potential interaction or cumulative 
effects of multiple components on a functional system. 
The application of systems biology techniques, such as 
whole transcriptome analyses, is a good starting point to 
understand the functional system effects of TCMs, as a 
basis for further improvement and optimisation of existing 
TCMs in the context of evidence based medicine.
Studies have confirmed that many lncRNAs 
play important regulatory roles in cancer [32]. Our de 
novo identification of lncRNAs showed that some of 
these may contribute to regulatory networks, and even 
be specifically or differentially expressed in MCF-7 
cancer cells treated by CKI. By integrating lncRNAs 
with protein-coding RNAs to reconstruct co-expression 
networks, we showed that this can be used as another 
powerful tool to understand global transcription changes 
potentially sensitive to TCM. We were able to confirm 
that “Cell cycle” and other cell growth related pathways 
might be the primary target pathways of CKI in MCF-
7 cell line as shown in DE analysis, but were able to do 
this in a more general sense, because we included all 
expression detectable transcripts during the reconstruction 
of co-expression networks. In addition, we also showed 
co-expression networks may be useful in identifying 
potential co-expressed “hub” transcripts, including both 
protein-coding RNAs and lncRNAs, for further functional 
experiments [48]. In conclusion, we applied and integrated 
multiple transcriptome analysis tools to describe and 
analyse the complexity of molecular mechanisms altered 
by CKI in MCF-7 breast cancer cells, and we hope that 
this can be useful to harness the “magic power” of TCM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Cell culture and drugs
MCF-7 cells were purchased from ATCC (HTB-
22™, VA, USA) and were cultured in DMEM medium 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and 
0.01 mg/mL human recombinant insulin (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) at 37°C with 5% CO2. CKI (total alkaloids 
concentration of 20.8 mg/mL) was obtained from 
ZhenDong pharmaceutical Co.Ltd (Shanxi, China), and 
5-FU was ordered from Sigma-Aldrich (MO, USA). For 
all in vitro experiments performed in this study, CKI was 
used at dilution of final concentration of either 1 mg/mL 
or 2 mg/mL of total alkaloids, and 5-FU was used at a final 
concentration of 10 ug/mL.
For cell culture in 6-well trays used for cell 
apoptosis assay, cell cycle assay, p53 protein staining 
assay and RNA extraction, each well was seeded with 
5×105 cells in 2 mL of medium and cultured overnight. On 
the following day, 1 mL of either medium, CKI or 5-FU 
was added to the cells. After 24 and 48 hours of treatment, 
cells were harvested and used in the above assays.
Cell viability assay
The wells of 96-well trays were seeded with 1×104 
cells in 50 μL of medium and cultured overnight. On the 
following day, 50 μL of either medium, CKI or 5-FU were 
added to the cells. Viability of the cells was measured at 0, 
24 and 48 hours after the treatment by adding XTT:PMS 
(50:1; Sigma-Aldrich). After 4-hour incubation at 37°C 
optical density (OD) of each well was read at 490 nm. The 
background OD was also measured and the average was 
subtracted from the OD readings of appropriate wells.
Apoptosis assay by annexin V/PI staining
Cells were cultured in 6-well trays and treated 
with drugs as described above. After 24 and 48 hours of 
treatment, cells were harvested and the rate of apoptosis 
was measured using Annexin V-FITC detecton kit 
(Biotool, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. The stained cells were sorted and data 
acquired on an LSRII (BD Biosciences, NJ, USA) and the 
data were analysed using FlowJo software (TreeStar Inc., 
OR, USA).

Caspase 3/7 colorimetric assay
Caspase 3/7 activity in cells was measured with 
a Caspase-3/7 Colorimetric Assay Kit (BioVision, CA, 
USA). Cells were cultured in 6-well trays and treated 
with drugs as described above. After 24 and 48 hours 
of treatment, cells were harvested and proteins from 
cells were extracted according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions and concentrations were determined with a 
Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific). Caspase-3/7 activity 
was then measured according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.
Cell cycle assay
Cells were cultured in 6-well trays and treated 
with drugs as described above. After 24 and 48 hours 
of treatment, cells were harvested and subjected to cell 
cycle analysis by PI staining as described previously [49] 
and the stained cells were sorted and the data acquired on 
LSRII and the data were analysed using FlowJo software.
Intranuclear/intracellular staining for p53
Cells were cultured in 6-well trays and treated 
with drugs as described above. After 24 and 48 hours 
of treatment, cells were fixed and permeabilised using 
Nuclear Factor Fixation and Permeabilization Buffer Set 
(Biolegend, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. 2×105 cells were labelled either with anti-
p53-PE or mouse IgG2b-PE (1 μg/mL; Biolegend) and the 
cells were sorted and the data were acquired on an LSRII, 
and the data were analysed using FlowJo software.
RNA extraction and sequencing
Cells were cultured in 6-well plates with a seeding 
density of 5×105 cells/well and treated with CKI or 
5-FU for 24 and 48 hours as above. Total RNA was 
isolated with the mirVana PARIS Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA 
samples were sent to the Cancer Genome Facility of the 
Australian Cancer Research Foundation (SA, Australia) 
for sequencing. The quality of the total RNA was verified 
on a Bioanalyzer ensuring all samples had RINs >7.0. 
Starting with 1 ug of total RNA, the polyA fraction was 
enriched using a NEBNext(r) Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic 
Isolation Module. Stranded mRNA libraries for Illumina 
sequencing were prepared using the NEBNext(r) Ultra 
Directional RNA kits from New England Biolabs, Inc. 
according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Version 2.0 July 
2013). Actinomycin D was added during cDNA synthesis 
to ensure high levels of strand specificity. All libraries 
were run on a Bionanalyzer to confirm library size and 
yield. Barcoded libraries were normalized and pooled 
based on concentrations determined by qPCR with Library 
Quantification kits from KAPA Biosystems. Libraries 
were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 across 5 
lanes with stranded paired-end 100 base pair reads. Raw 
and processed data were deposited at the Gene Expression 
Omnibus (GEO) data repository (GSE78512).
Data processing and functional annotation
Low quality and adaptor sequences in raw reads 
were trimmed using Trim_galore (v0.3.7, Babraham 
Bioinformatics) 
with 
the 
following 
parameters: 
--stringency 6 --paired. Then cleaned reads were 
aligned to the reference genome (hg19, UCSC) 
using STAR_2.4.0j with the following parameters: 
--outSAMstrandField intronMotif --outSAMattributes All 
--outFilterMismatchNmax 10 --seedSearchStartLmax 30 
[50]. Differential expression analysis was performed with 
edgeR and DE genes were selected with a False Discovery 
Rate (FDR) < 0.05 [51].
GO and KEGG over-representation analyses were 
performed using ClueGO with the following settings: 
biological process at 3rd level (for GO); right-sided 
hypergeometric test for enrichment analysis; p values were 
corrected for multiple testing according to the Benjamini-
Hochberg method. Over-represented terms/pathways were 
visualised with Cytoscape v3.2.1 [52, 53]. Signalling 
Pathway Impact Analysis (SPIA) was performed with 
SPIA package in R [19]. Gene expression status mapping 
in KEGG pathways was visualised with the R Pathview 
package [54].
Transcriptome validation with qPCR
Cells were cultured in 6-well trays and treated with 
drugs as described above. Untreated cells as well as cells 
treated for 24 and 48 hours were harvested and the cell 
pellets were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA 
was extracted using PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) and treated with TURBO DNA-Free 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using High 
Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
qPCR reactions were set up with PowerUp SYBR 
Green Master Mix where forward and reverse primers 
were added at a final concentration of 400 nM each. 
Reactions were run on the StepOne Plus Real-Time PCR 
system and the data were analysed using its software 
v2.3 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Relative levels of target 
mRNAs were calculated as 1/2ΔCT, where ΔCT=CT of 
target − CT of RSP13. The sequences of all primers used 
in this study are provided in Supplementary Table 6.
LncRNA identification
The flowchart for lncRNA identification is shown 
in Supplementary Figure 6. In summary, short reads 
were mapped against the genome and assembled into

longer transcripts, and then transcripts shorter than 200 
nucleotides (nt) were removed. Genomic coordinates 
of long transcripts were checked against refGenes 
from UCSC and classified into “refGene transcripts”, 
“intergenic transcripts”, “intronic transcripts” and 
“antisense transcripts”. The latter three classes of 
transcripts were selected to filter unannotated protein-
coding potential transcripts by following two steps: 1) 
Sequence similarity search against the Swiss-Prot protein 
database; 2) Predict Open Reading Frame(s) (ORF). In 
order to get a more reliable lncRNA dataset, we selected 
transcripts with expression higher than 1 count per million 
(CPM, normalised using the TMM method in edgeR) in at 
least 2 of 27 individual samples.
Reconstruction of co-expression networks
RefGenes were pre-filtered by expression (> 1 
CPM in at least 2 of 27 individuals). Expression matrices 
 
for all pre-filtered refGenes and lncRNAs were merged 
to reconstruct co-expression networks with WGCNA 
[55]. “16” was selected as the soft thresholding power 
according to the protocol of WGCNA. Co-expression 
modules were visualized with Cytoscape v3.2.1. Between-
ness centrality was used to select “hub” nodes. GO and 
KEGG over-representation analyses were performed with 
DAVID (Database For Annotation, Visualization and 
Integrated Discovery) [56].
