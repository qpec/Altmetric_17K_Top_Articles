Current therapies for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are symptomatic and do
not target the underlying Aβ pathology and other important hallmarks
including neuronal loss. PPARγ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a cofactor for
transcription factors including the peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor-γ (PPARγ), and it is involved in the regulation of metabolic
genes, oxidative phosphorylation, and mitochondrial biogenesis.
We previously reported that PGC-1α also regulates the transcription
of β-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), the main enzyme involved in Aβ
generation, and its expression is decreased in AD patients. We
aimed to explore the potential therapeutic effect of PGC-1α by gen-
erating a lentiviral vector to express human PGC-1α and target it by
stereotaxic delivery to hippocampus and cortex of APP23 transgenic
mice at the preclinical stage of the disease. Four months after injec-
tion, APP23 mice treated with hPGC-1α showed improved spatial and
recognition memory concomitant with a significant reduction in Aβ
deposition, associated with a decrease in BACE1 expression. hPGC-1α
overexpression attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and
microglial activation. This effect was accompanied by a marked preser-
vation of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 area and increased expression
of neurotrophic factors. The neuroprotective effects were secondary to
a reduction in Aβ pathology and neuroinflammation, because wild-type
mice receiving the same treatment were unaffected. These results sug-
gest that the selective induction of PGC-1α gene in specific areas of the
brain is effective in targeting AD-related neurodegeneration and holds
potential as therapeutic intervention for this disease.
Aβ | BACE1 | growth factor | inflammation | neurodegeneration
A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of de-
mentia in the elderly and affects more than 40 million people
worldwide. The global cost of dementia is estimated at more than
800 billion USD, without effective treatment that can at least halt,
cure, and prevent the disease (World Alzheimer’s report 2015, ref.
1). Current drug therapies for AD are merely symptomatic and do
not target the underlying cause of the disease. New strategies include
disease-modifying treatments, which aim to reduce the production of
amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides and plaques or the modified protein tau
and tangles. These particular therapies are expected to block the
progression of the disease and prevent neuronal loss, but are likely
also to have serious side effects (2, 3).
We have recently explored the potential neuroprotective effects of
the PPARγ-coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a transcriptional coactivator
for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) and
for other transcription factors (4). PGC-1α is abundantly expressed
in high-energy demanding tissues such as adipose tissue, liver, skel-
etal muscle, heart, kidney, and brain (5, 6) where it is involved in the
regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, oxidative phosphoryla-
tion, and mitochondrial biogenesis (4, 5).
PGC-1α has been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases
(6) and its expression is reduced in the brain of AD patients (7, 8).
Interestingly, exogenous human PGC-1α expression in neuroblas-
toma cells and in primary neurons from the Tg2576 mouse model of
AD decreased Aβ generation and increased nonamyloidogenic
sAPPα levels (7, 8). Additionally, we showed that PGC-1α me-
diates this effect by reducing β-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1)
gene transcription via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism (7).
Conversely, crossing Tg2576 with mice deficient in PGC-1α or
silencing PGC-1α using siRNA transfection in neuronal cells, led
to increased Aβ levels (7–9). Pharmacological stimulation of
PGC-1α synthesis with nicotinamide riboside, the precursor of
NAD+, resulted in reduced Aβ levels and attenuated cognitive
deterioration in Tg2576 mice (9). Furthermore, treatment with
resveratrol, another PGC-1α activator, increased the activity of
the Aβ-degrading enzyme neprilysin and reduced amyloid plaques
(10). Nevertheless, these drugs may promote these beneficial ef-
fects by acting on molecules other than PGC-1α, and an additional
independent approach to investigate these specific functions of
PGC-1α in AD was therefore considered relevant. We hypothe-
sized that gene therapy with PGC-1α delivered in the brain could
be neuroprotective because of its effect on the transcription of
genes involved in Aβ generation, energy and glucose metabolism,
and oxidative stress.
The aim of this study was to generate a lentiviral vector expressing
human PGC-1α and target it in defined brain regions of APP23
transgenic mice by stereotaxic delivery, allowing us to evaluate the
specific effects of this transcriptional regulator and define its po-
tential for gene therapy for AD. Our results show that PGC-1α
prevents neuronal loss by increasing the transcription of growth
Significance
The PPARγ-coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) is a transcriptional regulator
of genes involved in energy metabolism. We observed previously
that PGC-1α decreases the generation of Aβ in cell culture, and its
levels are reduced in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains. To de-
termine its potential therapeutic role in vivo, we delivered PGC-1α
in specific brain areas of an AD model by using viral vectors. We
found that PGC-1α–injected mice showed decreased Aβ plaques
by reducing the expression of the main enzyme involved in Aβ
production, preserving most neurons in the brain and performing
as well as wild-type mice in cognitive tests. Therefore, PGC-1α
selective delivery shows promising therapeutic value in AD.

Effective Transduction of PGC1α Using RVG-B2c Lentiviral Vectors
Confers Neurotropism and High Expression in the Brain. Lentiviral
vectors (LV) that efficiently transduce neurons were generated,
compared by various combinations of gene promoters and viral
envelope glycoproteins. We first tested vesicular stomatitis viral
glycoprotein (VSVG) and rabies virus glycoprotein B2c (RVG).
Pseudotyping lentiviral vectors with the RVG envelope glyco-
protein confers both neurotropism and, more importantly, the
ability of retrograde transport along neuronal axons (11). Addi-
tionally, we compared lentiviral vectors carrying the ubiquitous
human CMV major immediate-early enhancer/promoter or the
neuronal-specific human synapsin I (SYN) gene promoter. We
generated combinations of VSVG-CMV, VSVG-SYN, RVG-
CMV, and RVG-SYN vectors that carried the enhanced GFP
(eGFP) gene and injected them unilaterally in the brain of wild-type
mice (SI Text and Fig. S1 A–L). RVG-CMV resulted in higher
expression, transduced cells both proximal and distal to the site of
injection and preferentially transduced pyramidal neurons in the
cortex and the CA1 area of the hippocampus (HIP) (Fig. S1 G–L).
CMV promoter was selected because it resulted in higher expres-
sion compared with the SYN promoter (Fig. S1 E–M). The neu-
rotropism of the vector was confirmed by costaining for eGFP and
NeuN (Fig. 1 A–D), and by showing little or no localization of the
transgene with astrocytes or microglia by costaining of eGFP with
Iba1 and GFAP (Fig. 1 E–H). Therefore, the RVG-CMV-eGFP
LV and RVG-CMV- hPGC-1α LV (further referred as LV-eGFP
and LV-hPGC-1α) were generated as the vectors of choice (Fig. 1I).
The efficiency of the lentiviral vectors LV-eGFP and LV-
hPGC-1α injected in the cortex and HIP of wild-type and APP23
mice was measured 4 mo after injection (p.i.). The expression of
hPGC-1α protein in the brain of injected mice was evaluated by
IHC using an antibody against the V5 tag, at the N terminus of
the hPGC-1α construct (Fig. 1J). Moreover, hPGC-1α mRNA
expression was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR)
analysis in the HIP, parietal cortex (Pt Ctx), and frontal cortex
(Ft Ctx) of the injected APP23 mice (Fig. 1K).
hPGC-1α Gene Delivery Improves Spatial and Recognition Memory in
APP23 Mice. We next determined the therapeutic effects of long-
term overexpression of hPGC-1α in the cortex and HIP of wild-
type and APP23 mice, delivering it at the age of 8 mo and lasting
for 4.5 mo (Fig. 2A). At 8 mo, female APP23 mice show the first
rare amyloid deposits, representing the preclinical stage of the
disease (12–14). To assess any adverse effects, we monitored
several parameters after surgery, including body weight, mobility,
and anxiety (Supporting Information and Fig. S2 A–C).
To define whether chronic expression of LV-hPGC-1α in the
cortex and HIP of APP23 and wild-type mice affected their
memory, behavioral tests were carried out 4 mo p.i. Spatial
memory was evaluated by object location task (OLT), based on
the spontaneous tendency of rodents to spend more time ex-
ploring a relocated object (Fig. 2B and Fig. S2D). The APP23
mice (at 12 mo of age) that received the control vector displayed
spatial memory deficits and were not able to discriminate be-
tween the displaced and the nondisplaced object (Fig. 2B).
Conversely, APP23 animals injected with LV-hPGC-1α showed
no deficits in spatial memory and performed as well as the two
groups of wild-type mice, all preferring the displaced object (Fig.
2B). Following OLT, the mice were subjected to the novel object
recognition test (NOR), which measures their ability to explore
longer a novel object over a familiar one (Fig. 2C and Fig. S2E).
The results of the NOR revealed that the APP23/LV-hPGC-1α
mice were able to discriminate and explored for a longer time the

 novel object, whereas the APP23/LV-eGFP mice showed profound
deficits (Fig. 2C). It is worth noting that the expression of hPGC-1α
in the brain did not improve the performance of wild-type mice (Fig.
2C). These combined results demonstrate that lentiviral-mediated
hPGC-1α expression prevented memory deficits in APP23 mice.
hPGC-1α Chronic Overexpression Reduces BACE1, Aβ Levels, and
Plaque Load in APP23 Mice. To quantify Αβ load by IHC, we used
a monoclonal Aβ-specific antibody that does not cross-react with
full-length APP or carboxy-terminus domains (CTFs) (15). Histo-
pathological examination revealed significantly lower Αβ burden in
cortex (19.1% reduction) and HIP (30% reduction) in APP23/LV-
hPGC-1α mice compared with animals injected with the con-
trol vector (Fig. 3 A–C). Plaque burden was quantified after brain
sections were stained with AmyloGlo, instead of the standard
Thioflavin-S dye, because this interfered with eGFP detection. We
observed that the area covered by amyloid plaques was decreased in
the APP23/LV-hPGC-1α mice, both in the cortex and HIP com-
pared with the APP23/LV-eGFP mice (43% and 51% decrease,
respectively) (Fig. 3 D–F). Western blot analysis of brain homog-
enates confirmed the immunohistological results, showing reduced
Aβ levels in the APP23/LV-hPGC-1α mice compared with APP23
mice treated with control vector (Fig. 3 G and H and Fig. S3 A and
B). In addition, decreased ELISA values for Aβ40 and Aβ42 sub-
types in the same samples corroborated these results (Fig. 3I),
without changes in their ratio (Fig. S3C). Our previous in vitro
studies demonstrated that increased PGC-1α expression reduces
Bace1 transcription (7). In line with those in vitro results, the brain
levels of β-CTF and sAPPβ, the main products of BACE1, were
remarkably reduced in APP23 mice that received LV-hPGC-1α
compared with APP23 injected with LV-eGFP (Fig. 3 J and L and
Fig. S3 A and B), without changes in the expression of the precursor
protein APP (Fig. 3K and Fig. S3 A and B). In complete agreement,
the chronic expression of hPGC-1α in the brain of APP23 mice
lowered BACE1 protein levels compared with control mice (Fig.
3M). Interestingly, an inverse correlation between hPGC-1α and
Bace1 mRNA levels indicated lower Bace1 mRNA expression to be
associated with higher PGC-1α levels (Fig. 3N; Pearson’s r = −0.7255,
P < 0.05). Although no major changes were detected in sAPPα and
αCTFs, the products of α-secretase cleavage, the ratio sAPPα/sAPPβ
was found strongly increased, indicating a shifting in the balance
toward α-secretase byLV-hPGC-1α delivery (Fig. S3 D and E).
Furthermore, overexpression of hPGC-1α increased Adam17
mRNA levels but did not significantly affect Adam10 mRNA
(Fig. S3 K and L). No significant alterations were observed in the
Aβ clearance or degradation mechanisms (Fig. S3 F–J and M–O).
Together, our combined data demonstrate that LV-hPGC-1α
CNS transduction resulted in higher levels of human PGC-1α,
triggering a robust reduction of Aβ production and plaque for-
mation, however, not by affecting Aβ clearance or degradation.
hPGC-1α Attenuates Neuroinflammation in APP23 Mice. The APP23
mouse model of brain amyloidopathy exhibits a strong neuro-
inflammatory component (12–14). We quantified the density of
microglia and astrocytes in areas surrounding amyloid plaques of

 similar size (Fig. 4 A–L). Microglial activation was detected by IHC
for Iba-1 and found attenuated in APP23 injected with LV-hPGC-
1α compared with animals injected with control vector (Fig. 4 B, D–F,
and H–J). We did not observe major changes in astrocytosis sur-
rounding the plaques, detected by GFAP staining (Fig. 4 C, D, G,
H, K, and L), although total GFAP expression was reduced in
hippocampal homogenates of APP23/LV-hPGC-1α mice (Fig. 4M).
Importantly, the expression of the main proinflammatory cytokines
TNF-α and IL-1β was significantly reduced in the APP23/LV-
hPGC-1α mice compared with the APP23/LV-eGFP mice (Fig. 4 N
and O), whereas no significant changes were observed for IL-6,
IL-10, and MCP-1 (Fig. 4 P–R). In summary, hPGC-1α affects the
activation of microglia, reducing their proinflammatory profile.
hPGC-1α Prevents Neuronal Loss in the Hippocampus of APP23 Mice.
APP23 mice suffer neuronal loss in specified hippocampal areas at
age 12 mo (16) and was confirmed by immunohistochemical
analysis with NeuN in brains of APP23/LV-eGFP mice, showing a
30% reduction in neuronal number in the CA3, compared with
wild-type/LV-eGFP mice (Fig. 5 A, C, E, G, I). Remarkably, in
APP23 mice treated with LV-hPGC-1α, we observed a marked
preservation of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 (Fig. 5 D, H, I),
consistent with the absence of memory impairment described
above. We found no significant changes in neuronal density in the
dentate gyrus and subiculum in LV-hPGC-1α–injected mice (Fig.
5J and Fig. S4 A–E), suggesting that the neuroprotective effect was
not linked to increased neurogenesis. In addition, PGC-1α gene
delivery did not alter neuronal count in the brains of wild-type
mice, indicating that the positive effect on neurons was associated
with reduced amyloid load and pathology (Fig. 5 A, B, E, G, I).
This conclusion was further supported by data showing increased
mRNA expression of the neuroprotective factor (Fig. 5K) and the
levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD-95 only in APP23/LV-
hPGC-1α and not in wild-type mice (Fig. 5M and Fig. S4F).
Interestingly, the expression of Ngf was found increased in both
wild-type and APP23 mice overexpressing hPGC-1α (Fig. 5L).
Discussion
The present study shows that gene delivery of hPGC-1α in the
brain of transgenic APP23 mice reduced amyloid deposition,
improved memory, and prevented neuronal loss. Importantly, we
describe a potential treatment that can preserve neuronal viability
and improve memory in AD, corroborating other neuroprotective
approaches such as gene therapy with growth factors. This ap-
proach was recently highlighted in AD patients treated with NGF
gene delivery, which revealed increased axonal sprouting, cell
hypertrophy, and activation of functional markers (17).
The observed PGC-1α–mediated positive effects, however, do
not seem to involve alterations in neuronal proliferation, because
the preservation of dentate gyrus integrity, an area directly in-
volved in neurogenesis, remained unchanged by LV-hPGC-1α.
Most interestingly, increased expression of neurotrophic factors

 NGF and BDNF was evident following LV-hPGC-1α gene ther-
apy and both exert neuroprotective properties in AD (18, 19). In
line with our findings was the report showing that exercise-
induced BDNF expression was mediated by PGC-1α regulation
of Fndc5 gene expression (20). Moreover, PPARγ and PPARα,
the main transcription factors regulated by PGC-1α, induced the
transcription of BDNF in cultured neurons and glial cells (21, 22).
Combined, these data are fully consistent with a mechanism for
the neuroprotective effects of hPGC-1α in APP23 mice mediated,
at least partially, by increased transcription of specific growth
factors (Fig. S5K). Consistent with our results, previous work
demonstrated that PGC-1α knockout mice develop neurological
abnormalities and show prominent neurodegeneration (23, 24).
In addition, our data indicate that the beneficial effects on
memory and neurodegeneration are a consequence of the re-
duction in Aβ generation and the associated inflammatory re-
sponse, because memory, BDNF levels, PSD95 expression, and
neuronal numbers were not affected in wild-type mice that re-
ceived the same LV-hPGC-1α treatment. Therefore, the thera-
peutic effect of PGC-1α required a proinflammatory state to be
effective, in this case evidently caused by hAPP overexpression
and Aβ production in the APP23 mice (Fig. S5K). Furthermore,
because we found that hPGC-1α was mostly expressed in neurons, we
presume that the antiinflammatory reaction observed by hPGC-1α
delivery in the brain is secondary to the decrease on Aβ levels pro-
duced by neurons, because Aβ is able to induce a proinflammatory
reaction in the brain (25). Our results do not support a noticeable
involvement of enhanced mitochondrial function (Fig. S5) or the
autophagy/lysosomal pathway in the neuroprotective effects of
PGC-1α in APP23, as suggested in other neurological disease
models, such as Huntington’s disease (26).
A recent study of a bigenic model obtained crossing the Tg19959
with PGC-1α transgenic mice reported reductions in the levels of
Aβ40 by ELISA, whereas increased Congo red staining for ag-
gregated Aβ. The results of this publication were obtained from a
transgenic mouse overexpressing elevated levels of PGC-1α under
a promoter not specific for a particular cell type and, consequently,
the results do not necessarily have to coincide with our model, in
which the gene is expressed for only 4 mo in certain brain areas
(27). Indeed, sustained high overexpression of PGC-1α produced
toxic effects in muscles and heart, caused or accompanied by ex-
tensive mitochondrial proliferation and by myopathy (28, 29). Ex-
tremely high levels of PGC-1α achieved with adenoviral vectors
also resulted in deleterious effects in dopaminergic neurons, in
susbtantia nigra (30, 31) as opposed to the striatum, where fourfold
higher levels were not toxic, in mouse models of Huntington’s and
Parkinson’s diseases (32, 33). The different outcomes in different
studies must relate to the fact that dopaminergic neurons are more
susceptible to degeneration from oxidative damage than other
neuronal subtypes and suggest that selective delivery in specific
brain regions is necessary to achieve beneficial effects. The lentiviral
vector for delivery of hPGC-1α in our study was well tolerated, did
not trigger adverse effects, and allowed sustained expression of the
transgene for months. Successful proof-of-principle studies of gene
therapy using similarly pseudotyped lentiviral vectors have been
demonstrated in animal models of ALS (34, 35), spinal muscular
atrophy (36), and spinal nerve injury (37). In addition, we have
developed and tested a similar vector for dopamine replacement
therapy in late stage Parkinson’s disease patients in a phase I/II
clinical trial, showing long-term expression and improved motor
behavior in treated patients (38). We believe, therefore, that future
innovations in gene therapy provide hope and clinical potential also
in Alzheimer’s dementia. Although this method of delivery is at this
time invasive and, therefore, has some translational limitations, our
data provide a proof of concept for future drug discovery programs
aimed to induce the PGC-1α gene to target neurodegeneration.

 and detected with secondary antibodies (AlexaFluor dyes; Invitrogen). Images
were captured by using a Leica SP5 Confocal microscope.
Protein Analysis. Western blot analysis was carried out as described (14) by
using antibodies against Aβ (clone 6E10) and sAPPβ (Covance), BACE1 (Cell
Signaling), PSD-95, IDE and LC3 (Abcam), COX-4 (from Kambiz Alavian, Im-
perial College London, London, UK), hPGC-1α and neprilysin (Santa Cruz) used
at a 1:1,000 dilution, R1(57) (from P. Mehta, New York State Institute for Basic
Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY) at a 1:2,000 di-
lution and 140 (from Jochen Walter, University Bonn, Bonn, Germany)
against CT-of APP and APOE (Santa Cruz) at a 1:500 dilution, V5 (Invitrogen)
at a 1:5,000, and LRP-1 (from Claus Pietrzik, University Mainz, Mainz, Germany)
and β-actin (Abcam) at a 1:10,000 dilution. The intensity of the bands was
quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software, and sample loading was
normalized to β-actin. The levels of human Αβ40 and Aβ42 were determined
by using a High Sensitivity Human Amyloid β40 and β42 ELISA kit (Millipore).
For the mouse cytokines, we used kits from Preprotech.
RNA Extraction and qRT-PCR. Tissues were lysed and homogenized in TRIzol re-
agent (Ambion), and total RNA was isolated by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen).
First-strand cDNA was generated by using Taqman reverse transcription reagents
(Applied Biosystems) for Taqman Probes or QuantiTect Reverse Transcription kit
(Qiagen) for custom-made primers (SI Materials and Methods). qPCR was per-
formed by using TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix or Quantifast SYBR green in a
7900HT real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). mRNA quantities were nor-
malized to Gapdh after determination by the comparative Ct method.
Statistical Analysis. The data were analyzed with GraphPad Prism version 6 and
SPSS version 20 (IBM) by using two-tailed Student’s t test or Mann–Whitney
test, two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc analysis and correla-
tion analysis. Power analysis was performed by using GPower 3.0. Columns
represent means ± SEM. Differences were considered significant for P < 0.5.
