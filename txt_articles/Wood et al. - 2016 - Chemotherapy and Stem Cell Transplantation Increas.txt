The expression of markers of cellular senescence increases exponentially in multiple tissues with aging. Age-re-
lated physiological changes may contribute to adverse outcomes in cancer survivors. To investigate the impact of
high dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation on senescence markers in vivo, we collected blood and
clinical data from a cohort of 63 patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation. The expression of
p16INK4a, a well-established senescence marker, was determined in T-cells before and 6 months after transplant.
RNA sequencing was performed on paired samples from 8 patients pre- and post-cancer therapy. In patients un-
dergoing allogeneic transplant, higher pre-transplant p16INK4a expression was associated with a greater number
of prior cycles of chemotherapy received (p = 0.003), prior autologous transplantation (p = 0.01) and prior ex-
posure to alkylating agents (p = 0.01). Transplantation was associated with a marked increase in p16INK4a ex-
pression 6 months following transplantation. Patients receiving autologous transplant experienced a larger
increase in p16INK4a expression (3.1-fold increase, p = 0.002) than allogeneic transplant recipients (1.9-fold in-
crease, p = 0.0004). RNA sequencing of T-cells pre- and post- autologous transplant or cytotoxic chemotherapy
demonstrated increased expression of transcripts associated with cellular senescence and physiological aging.
Cytotoxic chemotherapy, especially alkylating agents, and stem cell transplantation strongly accelerate expres-
sion of a biomarker of molecular aging in T-cells.

1. Introduction
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially cu-
rative modality for high-risk hematologic diseases, but the procedure
has profound and long-term effects on recipient hematologic and im-
mune function. The long-term toxicity of HSCT may result from
chemo-radiotherapy given at the time of transplantation (condition-
ing), from donor-host immune differences after allogeneic transplants
or from accelerated stem cell exhaustion of transplanted stem cells
(Hake et al., 2007). These late toxicities manifest as increased risk for in-
fection, chronic graft-vs-host disease, bone marrow failure and acute
leukemia.
Recent evidence has demonstrated that peripheral blood T-cells ex-
press markers of cellular senescence with physiological aging. The over-
all loss of physiological reserve that accompanies aging is associated
with an accumulation of senescent cells (Sharpless and DePinho,
2007; Rodier and Campisi, 2011). Cellular senescence is triggered by ac-
tivation of tumor suppressor mechanisms associated with cellular
stressors, and results in expression of the p16INK4a tumor suppressor
protein encoded by the CDKN2a locus, which has emerged as one of
the more useful markers of senescence in vivo (Campisi, 2013;
Sharpless and Sherr, 2015). Expression of p16INK4a in peripheral blood
T lymphocytes increases exponentially with chronological age, doubling
about every decade (Zindy et al., 1997; Krishnamurthy et al., 2004; Liu
et al., 2009). Polymorphisms of senescence regulators have been associ-
ated with age-related conditions such as cancer, pulmonary fibrosis,
glaucoma, atherosclerosis, and type II diabetes (Jeck et al., 2012; Siegel
et al., 2012). Prior work has shown that several age-promoting stressors
such as smoking, physical inactivity and chronic HIV infection accelerate
the expression of p16INK4a and other markers of cellular senescence (Liu
et al., 2009; Nelson et al., 2012). Importantly, we recently showed that
cytotoxic chemotherapy, given in the adjuvant setting, markedly in-
creases expression of senescence markers in the peripheral blood, con-
sistent with ~15 years of chronological aging (Sanoff et al., 2014).
Increasingly, older individuals are considered for autologous or allo-
geneic transplantation. While age itself is usually not considered an ab-
solute contraindication to transplantation, older individuals do have

 higher risks of acute transplant-related toxicities such as cardiac ar-
rhythmias, diarrhea and mucositis (Wildes et al., 2014). Further, age-
related comorbid illness is itself prognostic for outcomes in autolo-
gous and allogeneic transplant recipients, suggesting that functional,
if not chronological, age of prospective transplant candidates is a po-
tentially important variable for clinical decision-making. Lastly, sur-
vivors of transplants, regardless of age, are at risk for accelerated
acquisition of several age-related syndromes such as endocrine dys-
function, cognitive impairment, cardiovascular morbidity, immune
dysfunction, secondary neoplasms, and neuromuscular impairment
(Fried et al., 2001).
In murine models, serial transplantation per se, in the absence of ex-
posure to cytotoxic agents, is associated with accelerated aging of he-
matopoietic stem cells (HSC), manifesting as ‘HSC exhaustion’
(Harrison and Astle, 1982). Likewise, evidence suggests HSC exhaustion
occurs in humans as well. HSC yields for autologous transplant from pa-
tients that have undergone significant prior chemotherapy are signifi-
cantly depressed compared to yields from less heavily treated
individuals (Clark and Brammer, 1998), and the transplantation of in-
sufficient numbers of HSC is associated with long term graft failure
(Perez-Simon et al., 1999). Additionally, transplantation is associated
with an increased rate of telomere shortening, which has been associat-
ed with certain adverse outcomes in transplant recipients (Lee et al.,
1999; Lewis et al., 2004; Akiyama et al., 2000; Pipes et al., 2006). Be-
cause individuals with hematologic malignancies have an increasing
array of transplant approaches of varying intensity as well as non-trans-
plant treatment approaches available to them, understanding the im-
pact of treatment upon functional aging may have important
implications for the care of both prospective transplant candidates as
well as transplant survivors. Toward that end, we measured expression
of p16INK4a, a marker of molecular age that can be serially assessed, in
HSC-derived T-cells before and after stem cell transplantation. Addition-
ally, we performed whole transcriptomic RNA sequencing in a subset of
paired samples to further examine the effects of chemotherapy or trans-
plantation on T-cell function.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Patients
For the transplant patient population, participants were over the
age of 18 and underwent either autologous or allogeneic stem cell
transplantation for any hematologic malignancy between 2010 and
2013 at the University of North Carolina (UNC) Hospitals. Patient
samples were obtained from two non-randomized, non-blinded ob-
servational cohorts: a study investigating symptom burden after
transplantation, and a generic tissue procurement protocol. Studies
were approved by the UNC Institutional Review Board (11–0600
and 13–1705), with study procedures confirming to standards indi-
cated by the Declaration of Helsinki. Eligible patients were identified
from the electronic medical records and approached by research
personnel prior to scheduled transplantation for provision of signed
informed consent. Patients undergoing concurrent radiation, che-
motherapeutic, or investigational therapy other than transplant-re-
lated therapy were excluded. All patients received standard-of-care
therapies and treatments as clinically needed. Medical history and
treatment information were abstracted from the medical record.
Samples were obtained in both cohorts from just before transplanta-
tion, and paired samples from 6 months post-transplantation were
also obtained if available. Molecular analyses were performed by in-
vestigators blinded to patient data, and investigators collecting clin-
ical information were blinded to laboratory results until data
collection was complete. For the breast cancer patient population,
T-cell RNA collected in the study Sanoff et al. (Sanoff et al., 2014)
was used in the RNA sequencing analysis.
2.2. Assessment of p16INK4a expression
See Sanoff et al. (Sanoff et al., 2014) for details. In brief, CD3+ T-cells
were isolated from up to 10-ml of peripheral blood using anti-CD3
microbeads and an AutoMACSPRO separator (Miltenyi Biotec, San
Diego, CA). Purity of T cells was determined to be ~95% when isolated
from fresh blood and ~50% when isolated from cryopreserved PBMCs
in pilot experiments. T cell purity in clinical trial samples was monitored
by measuring expression of the gamma subunit of the CD3. Total RNA
was isolated using RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and cDNA were prepared
using ImProm-II reverse transcriptase kit (Promega). Expression of
p16INK4a was measured by TaqMan quantitative reverse-transcription
polymerase chain reaction specific for p16INK4a and normalized to
YWHAZ housekeeping gene (Mane et al., 2008; Dheda et al., 2004).
2.3. RNA Sequencing
RNA was extracted and rRNA was removed using the Ribo-Zero kit.
RNA libraries were prepared by using the Illumina TruSeq RNA Sample
Preparation Kit v2 and then sequenced by Illumina HiSeq2000. Reads
were subjected to quality control as previously described (Cancer
Genome Atlas Research, 2012). RNA reads were aligned to human
hg19 genome assembly using Mapsplice (Wang et al., 2010). Gene def-
initions were obtained from the UCSC known Gene table. Gene expres-
sion
was
estimated
using
RSEM
(RNA-Seq
by
Expectation
Maximization) (Li and Dewey, 2011). Genes differentially expressed
due to treatment were identified by DESeq2 (Love et al., 2014) using a
bivariate model to adjust for subject specific effects. The resulting statis-
tics were subjected to gene set enrichment analysis by using the GSEA
(Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) rank test (Subramanian et al., 2005).
Expression estimates were normalized to a fixed upper quartile and
log2 transformed prior to visualization.
2.4. Statistical Analyses
The sample size was determined by the availability of clinical speci-
mens from the two study cohorts as described. Log2-transformed
p16INK4a expression values were standardized through conversion to
Z-score to facilitate combining the two sample sets. Z-scores were calcu-
lated separately for the two transplant cohorts using the formula:
Zi ¼ Xi−μ
ð
Þ=σ
where μ is population mean, and σ is standard deviation.
For samples present in both cohorts, individual Z scores were aver-
aged. Associations between p16INK4a expression and pre-transplant var-
iables were performed using linear regression (for continuous
variables) or one-way analysis of variance (for categorical variables). A
paired t-test was used to compare p16INK4a expression before and after
transplant. Data were analyzed by N. Mitin using JMP11 (SAS, Cary,
NC) and A. Snavely using R. All tests of statistical significance were
two-sided. P values of 0.05 or less were considered statistically
significant.
3. Results
Two observational cohorts (Table 1) were combined for our analysis,
and the baseline characteristics of the aggregated cohort are shown in
Table 2. In order to compare samples analyzed from the two observa-
tional cohorts, we converted all p16INK4a expression values to a normal-
ized Z-score as described in the methods. Using this conversion, we
found excellent correlation among Z-scores for the 17 patients that
had separate samples obtained in both cohorts (Table 3), suggesting
the aggregation of the observational cohorts for analysis is valid. In the
combined cohort there were 26 unique patients who underwent autol-
ogous
transplantation
and

 transplantation, for a total of 63 unique patients (Table 2). A majority
of autologous transplant recipients had myeloma, and the rest had
lymphoma as an underlying diagnosis. Most allogeneic transplant
recipients had leukemia as their underlying diagnosis. Five allogene-
ic transplant recipients had previously undergone autologous
transplantation.
Among autologous HSCT recipients, there were no baseline charac-
teristics that were associated with pre-transplant p16INK4a expression.
Among allogeneic HSCT recipients, however, a greater number of cycles
of chemotherapy received before allogeneic transplant, history of prior
autologous transplantation, and history of alkylating agent exposure
were all significantly associated with higher pre-transplant p16INK4a ex-
pression (p b 0.01 for each, Table 4A and B). In accord with results in pa-
tients treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer (Sanoff et al., 2014),
prior exposure to alkylating agents was associated with a 1.9-fold in-
crease in p16INK4a expression (absolute value, log2 = 0.91). Moreover,
there was a 2.3-fold increase in p16INK4a expression level (absolute
value, log2 = 1.22) in the small number of allogeneic patients that
had undergone prior autologous transplant. Previously, we have
shown that a 2-fold increase in p16INK4a expression is equivalent to
~10 years of chronological aging (Sanoff et al., 2014). Therefore, these
data suggest that extensive exposure to alkylating agents or autologous
transplantation is equivalent in molecular terms to a chronological
decade or more increase in the chronological age of Peripheral Blood
T-Lymphocytes (PBTL).
Next, we determined the effects of HSCT on molecular age of PBTL as
measured by p16INK4a expression by comparing pre- and post-HSCT
p16INK4a levels within an individual. As shown in Table 5, hematopoietic
stem cell transplantation was associated with a significant increase in
p16INK4a expression levels for both autologous and allogeneic transplant
recipients. Allogeneic transplant recipients showed a pronounced in-
crease in p16INK4a expression post-HSCT (1.93-fold, p = 0.0004). In
the allogeneic setting, the PBTL pre-HSCT were derived from the host,
whereas the PBTL post-HSCT were largely if not entirely donor-derived
(given near 100% chimerism in patients post-engraftment). Since the
hosts, who generally were transplanted for AML, had experienced
prior chemotherapy and, in a small number of cases, auto-HSCT, we
would expect that the pre-HSCT levels of p16INK4a would be consider-
ably higher than the expression of p16INK4a in their healthy donors.
Therefore, the measured change in p16INK4a from pre-HSCT to post-
HSCT in allogeneic recipients likely underestimates the age-promoting
effects on the graft of HSCT, given that the pre-HSCT levels were

 elevated in the recipients from prior therapeutic exposure. In the alloge-
neic HSCT setting, it is possible that other unaccounted factors (e.g.
post-transplant calcineurin-inhibitor exposure) may have also contrib-
uted to the observed effect.
In order to directly measure the effects of human HSCT per se on mo-
lecular age, we turned to an analysis of patients undergoing autologous
HSCT. In accord with our finding that autologous HSCT prior to allogene-
ic transplant was associated with elevated p16INK4a in pooled patients
(Table 4), we noted that within any given patient, autologous HSCT
was associated with a marked increase in p16INK4a expression from
pre-transplant to 6 months post-transplant (3.05-fold, p = 0.002).
This finding suggests that the forced bone marrow repopulation associ-
ated with transplantation per se accelerates the molecular aging of
PBTL, in the absence of significant chemotherapy exposure to the graft.
3.1. Relationship of Transplantation and Chemotherapy with Peripheral
Blood T-cell Gene Expression
To further understand the long-term effects of DNA damaging
agents and HSCT on PBTL, we performed whole transcriptome RNA se-
quencing before and after cancer therapy. In order to identify transcrip-
tional changes that were not specific to a particular noxious insult, but
instead were induced by the generic insult of forced bone marrow re-
generation, we performed an analysis of samples pre- and post-autolo-
gous transplantation (3 pairs of samples) or pre- and post-cytotoxic
chemotherapy (5 pairs of samples). In order to focus on durable changes
to the T-cell transcriptome, PBTL were collected 6 months post-autolo-
gous HSCT or 6–12 months post-adjuvant chemotherapy with doxoru-
bicin and cyclophosphamide for breast cancer (these samples are
described in (Sanoff et al., 2014)). We performed whole transcriptome
RNA sequencing of ribosome depleted total RNA on pre- and post-ther-
apy T-cell samples, and compared expression profiles through pairwise
supervised analysis. This approach identified a signature of ~500 coding
transcripts
whose
expression
was
significantly
(adjusted
p-
value b 0.05) and durably altered by these types of cancer therapy. If re-
stricted to genes whose expression changed N1.9-fold from baseline, we
identified 134 coding transcripts that significantly increased in expres-
sion, and 47 transcripts that significantly decreased in expression
(Supp. Tables 1, 2), which are presented as a representative subset in
Fig. 1 and overall by hierarchical clustering in Fig. 2. These data demon-
strate a potent and lasting effect on transcription of the T-cell organ
after forced bone marrow regeneration.
In order to determine the effects of auto-transplant or chemotherapy
on T-cell function, we performed several types of bioinformatic analysis
on these RNA sequencing data. We used gene set enrichment analysis
(GSEA) and supervised gene set analysis (SAM-GSA) to compare the
genes altered by cancer therapy to ~8000 known gene sets in the Molec-
ular Signatures database (Subramanian et al., 2005). These analyses
identified a large number of published signatures with significant over-
lap with our gene list, of which the vast majority (N90%) were immuno-
logic. Using an adjusted p-value of 0.05, 211 gene sets significantly
overlapped with transcripts more highly expressed in the pre-therapy
samples (Supp. Table 3), and 98 overlapped with transcripts that were
more highly expressed in the post-therapy samples (Supp. Table 4). Hi-
erarchical clustering of representative GSEA signatures are shown in
Figs. 3–7. These GSEA results appear to be predominantly explained
by changes in the composition of the CD3+ fraction of lymphocytes
post-cancer therapy. For example, transcripts that were more highly
expressed in memory CD4+ cells relative to naïve cells increased
after cancer therapy (Fig. 3), and the same was true for transcripts
that were more highly expressed in effector memory compared to
central memory CD4+ cells (Fig. 4). Transcripts that were more
highly expressed in regulatory T cells compared to conventional T
cells also increased following cancer treatment (Fig. 5). As shifts
from central memory and naïve cells to effector cells and Tregs are
hallmark changes of peripheral T-cells with aging (Desai et al.,
2010), these data provide further evidence that cancer therapy ac-
celerates the changes in T-cell subsets that are associated with
aging of the cellular immune system.
An analysis of specific genes altered by cancer therapy was also illu-
minating (selected transcripts are clustered in Fig. 1). For example, we
observed a robust increase in transcripts associated generally with cel-
lular senescence (e.g. CDKN2a, IL8, HMGA2, CCL4) (Narita et al., 2006;
Acosta et al., 2008; Hammond and Sharpless, 2008; Cheng et al., 2015)
or telomere shortening in T-cells (e.g. KLRK1, NUAK1, DSP, PIF1)
(Humbert et al., 2010; Soriani et al., 2014; Textor et al., 2011;
Lansdorp, 2007; Robin et al., 2014). Additionally, we noted changes
that
have
been
previously
associated
with
T-cell
aging
and
immunosenescence: decreased CD28 expression (Effros et al., 1994)
and increased expression of several NK markers (e.g. CX3CR1, KLRK1,
KLRA1) (Goronzy and Weyand, 2005; Sciume et al., 2011; Bauer et al.,
1999; Bull et al., 2000). Consistent with the GSEA results and known
patterns of human T-cell aging, there was a relative depletion of

transcripts associated with effector CD8+ T-cells (e.g. decreased CCR7
and IL7Rα, with increased GZMB, CD8a and NK markers (Fig. 1)). In ac-
cord with these processes, we observed that cancer therapy induced
the expression of transcripts that are more highly expressed in T-cells
from old versus young donors (Fig. 6). The effects on transcripts associ-
ated with T-cell exhaustion were less consistent: a few well-recognized
markers of exhaustion significantly increased post-bone marrow insult
(e.g. CD160 and LAG3, Fig. 1), whereas published signatures of T-cell ex-
haustion demonstrated a mixed pattern of expression in GSEA analysis
(Fig. 7, see also Tables 8 and 9). These gene-specific data provide evi-
dence beyond changes to p16INK4a (Table 2) that generic types of hema-
topoietic injury (e.g. forced bone marrow repopulation, cytotoxic
chemotherapy) induces durable transcriptional changes characteristic
of T-cell aging and immunosenescence, suggesting these insults acceler-
ate T-cell molecular aging.
4. Discussion
In this work, we show that that DNA damaging chemotherapy and
stem cell transplantation potently induce the transcriptional changes
characteristic of aging in PBTL. This includes both changes associated
with an altered composition of the T-cell organ with aging (e.g. de-
creased naïve and central memory cells versus increased effector mem-
ory cells and Tregs) as well as changes associated with telomere
shortening and cellular senescence. While the notion that DNA damag-
ing agents induce cellular senescence in vivo is non-controversial, a re-
markable aspect of this work is the finding that autologous HSCT
markedly induces the transcriptional changes of PBTL aging. For exam-
ple, auto-HSCT increases the expression of p16INK4a, a highly dynamic
marker of senescence, to a degree comparable ~30 years of chronologi-
cal age. A similar increase in p16INK4a expression with auto-HSCT has
been reported in myeloma patients (Rosko et al., 2015). As the autograft

 is not exposed to DNA damaging chemotherapy, this observation sug-
gests that the forced proliferation that accompanies BM re-engraftment,
even in the absence of exogenous clastogens, may be age-promoting in
humans.
In accord with prior work (Sanoff et al., 2014), we observed relative-
ly increased expression of PBTL p16INK4a in pre-treatment samples from
patients undergoing allogeneic, but not autologous stem cell transplant.
This observation likely reflects differences in prior therapy between
these two patient groups: with allogeneic HSCT patients having re-
ceived high doses of alkylating agents and anthracyclines for acute leu-
kemia, whereas autologous patients received largely non-cytotoxic
anti-myeloma therapies such as bortezomib and lenalidomide. This ob-
servation suggests that cytotoxic chemotherapy may be more age-pro-
moting than non-cytotoxic drugs used for myeloma, and is consonant
with the practice of avoiding alkylating agents in patients with myelo-
ma because such drugs impair subsequent stem cell collection (Clark
and Brammer, 1998).
It is perhaps surprising that autologous HSCT induces the strongest
effect on PBTL molecular age, as measured by p16INK4a expression, of
any noxious stimulus to date tested, including cytotoxic chemotherapy
(Sanoff et al., 2014), chronic HIV infection (Nelson et al., 2012), tobacco
use (Liu et al., 2009) or physical inactivity (Liu et al., 2009). We believe
the most likely explanation for this finding is that the forced BM regen-
eration that accompanies re-engraftment induces intrinsic HSC aging.
Serial transplant readily ‘exhausts’ HSC in murine models (Harrison,
1979), leading to a ‘myeloid skewing’ characterized by a marked decline
in the per HSC capacity to produce naïve T-cells (Janzen et al., 2006), an
observation that is in accord with our RNAseq analysis (Fig. 3). Further-
more, though pre-treatment samples from patients undergoing alloge-
neic HSCT had higher PBTL p16INK4a expression than those from
patients undergoing autologous HSCT, it is possible that pre-transplant
therapy had some age-promoting effect upon PBTLs in autologous
HSCT recipients. Thus, in combination with forced BM regeneration,
PBTLs of autologous HSCT recipients were “aged” twice due to therapy
and then transplant, possibly helping to explain the larger effect on
PBTL p16INK4a expression from autologous in comparison with allogene-
ic HSCT.
Beyond an effect on HSC, however, it is possible that damage to other
tissues contributes to this effect. For example, the thymus is damaged by
pre-transplant conditioning with high-dose chemotherapy, and it is

 likely that graft-derived T-cells produced via a dysfunctional thymus ex-
hibit accelerated aging (Min et al., 2005; Montecino-Rodriguez et al.,
2013; Dorshkind et al., 2009; Linton and Dorshkind, 2004). Moreover,
it is possible that not all host hematopoietic stem cells and self-
renewing T-cells are destroyed by the conditioning regimen, and these
surviving cells could exhibit accelerated aging as a result of exposure
to conditioning. Since our analysis is performed on pooled PBTL, even
a rare population of surviving cells that highly express p16INK4a could af-
fect a post-transplant sample's results. While such effects could affect
PBTL p16INK4, it is unlikely that thymic damage or very rare surviving
host T-cells would cause the wholesale transcriptional effects observed
in the RNAseq analysis.
Our finding that post-transplant senescent T-cells were biased to-
ward the expression of transcripts associated with CD8+ effector cells
and NK cells is consistent with prior studies of T-cell aging and
immunosenescence. (Perillo et al., 1993; Jaruga et al., 2000; Lemster et
al., 2008). In aggregate, our work and other studies suggest that noxious
stimuli such as DNA damage, telomere shortening and forced regenera-
tion mimic the effects of chronologic age to augment the production of
hypo-replicative
T-cells
with
distinct
immunophenotype
(e.g.
CD8 + CD28-) that express effector molecules such as Granzyme B
and NK markers as well as markers of cellular senescence (e.g.
p16INK4a and IL8). Such senescence-promoting stimuli have a more com-
plex effect on markers of T-cell exhaustion, leading to increased expres-
sion of some exhaustion-associated markers and decreased expression
of others. This finding is in accord with the notion that there are at
least two different types of severely hyporeplicative states induced by
excess T-cell proliferation—cellular senescence and exhaustion (Akbar
and Henson, 2011)—with our work suggesting forced replication and
DNA damaging agents induce the former, but not the latter, in humans.
This work has several implications. First, it is possible that an assess-
ment of T-cell molecular age could be used to predict suitability for
transplantation. In fact, prior studies have shown that older autologous
HSCT recipients have a higher likelihood than younger recipients of fail-
ing to achieve complete peripheral blood count recovery at 1 year, par-
ticularly true in patients who have been exposed to prior cytotoxic
chemotherapy (Woolthuis et al., 2014; Bhatia et al., 2005). Such a use
would be similar to the suggestion that a renal allograft's molecular
age, as measured by p16INK4a expression, is a stronger predictor of
long-term graft function than donor age or telomere length
(Koppelstaetter et al., 2008; McGlynn et al., 2009; Gingell-Littlejohn et
al., 2013). Larger studies with longer follow-up would be needed to con-
firm the hypothesis that donor molecular age of HSC influences long-
term hematopoietic graft function. Second, post-transplant T-cell senes-
cence may have important implications with regard to T-cell function,
with an increase in the frequency of senescent T-cells leading to greater
long-term risk of infection or decreased response to vaccination
(Targonski et al., 2007). Additionally, if increased molecular age of
PBTL is the result of intrinsic HSC aging, this marker could also perhaps
predict other late complications of HSCT such as bone marrow failure,
MDS or secondary leukemia. Third, the finding that HSCT and DNA dam-
aging agents promote the molecular aging of T-cells suggests such

 agents may compromise the post-transplant ability to respond to ther-
apies intended to activate exhausted T-cells (e.g. anti-PD1 antibodies).
Finally, the significant increase in T-cell senescence after HSCT further
raises questions about the potential long term risks related to accelerat-
ed aging in recipients of two transplants (e.g. tandem autologous trans-
plantation). For diseases in which credible non-transplant treatment
approaches exist, pre-transplant “molecular age” and subsequent risk
for further transplant-related accelerated aging could impact clinical de-
cision-making.
We acknowledge limitations to our work. First, we did not have data
to demonstrate a correlation between the observed changes in biomarker
expression with T cell function. However, inasmuch as p16INK4a expres-
sion is arguably one of the best in vivo markers of cellular senescence
and is directly associated with age-related deterioration (Baker et al.,
2016), the signal of increased senescence early after transplantation is
clear and concerning, even if a clearer explanation of this phenomena re-
quires further study. Second, other aspects of post-transplant immune re-
constitution also influence the relative contribution of CD8 and CD4 T
cells to the CD3 population in the early post-transplant period. Third,
the relative contribution of clinical factors to PBTL p16INK4a expression, in-
cluding graft versus host disease, infection, and use of immunosuppres-
sive agents, could not be discerned in this analysis. Fourth, we did not
have sequential longitudinal post-transplant samples available to study
changes in p16INK4a expression over time. Fifth, donor samples were
limited. We were unable in this study to determine the source of the T
cells that were undergoing changes in biomarker expression following al-
logeneic transplantation; a clear idea of which cells were donor-derived
and which were recipient-derived would help to discern the relative ef-
fects of chemotherapy vs transplant upon p16INK4a expression.
In summary, we have shown that HSCT and cancer therapy strongly
increase the expression in T cells of p16INK4a, a well-known biomarker of
cellular senescence. Further, this likely occurs via an effect on hemato-
poietic stem cells. p16INK4a expression was markedly increased follow-
ing transplantation, and in association with amount and certain types
of chemotherapy. This observation may have implications for the man-
agement of patients with cancer as well as cancer survivors, in order to
limit pro-aging effects of treatment and to protect against the develop-
ment of frailty and other aging-related syndromes. Additional studies to
investigate the relationships between T-cell aging and adverse out-
comes following cancer therapy are warranted.

Fig. 7. A hierarchical clustering of transcripts from a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis Signature (GSE9650) with a mixed pattern of expression of signatures associated with naïve versus
exhausted CD8+ cells. Pre-treatment samples are on the left (grey bar above the heatmap) and post-treatment samples are on the right (blue bar). Sample numbers are shown below
the heatmap, with an “A” prior to sample numbers indicating patients undergoing auto-HSCT. Samples without an “A” indicate patients treated with chemotherapy and not
transplantation. Samples are ordered along the x-axis as in Fig. 1.
