Male-pattern baldness (MPB) is a common and highly heritable trait characterized by
androgen-dependent, progressive hair loss from the scalp. Here, we carry out the largest
GWAS meta-analysis of MPB to date, comprising 10,846 early-onset cases and 11,672
controls from eight independent cohorts. We identify 63 MPB-associated loci (Po5 � 10 � 8,
METAL) of which 23 have not been reported previously. The 63 loci explain B39% of the
phenotypic variance in MPB and highlight several plausible candidate genes (FGF5, IRF4,
DKK2) and pathways (melatonin signalling, adipogenesis) that are likely to be implicated in
the key-pathophysiological features of MPB and may represent promising targets for the
development of novel therapeutic options. The data provide molecular evidence that rather
than being an isolated trait, MPB shares a substantial biological basis with numerous other
human phenotypes and may deserve evaluation as an early prognostic marker, for example,
for prostate cancer, sudden cardiac arrest and neurodegenerative disorders.

 M
ale-pattern baldness (MPB) has a lifetime prevalence of
B80% in European men and is characterized by a
characteristic pattern of progressive hair loss in distinct
populations of androgen-dependent scalp hair follicles1. Early-
onset MPB in particular can exert profound negative effects on
quality of life2,3. While the pathobiology of MPB remains
incompletely understood4,5 and no causal therapy is available,
current MBP treatments are of limited efficacy in many patients
and even can have severe adverse effects6. Therefore, studies that
clarify the biological underpinnings of key-pathophysiological
features of MPB and enable the identification of novel molecular
targets for more effective therapeutic intervention are needed.
Here, molecular genetic studies that enable the identification of
early causal events and allow differentiation between disease
cause and consequence7, hold great potential and have already
proven to be successful in the identification of contributing risk
factors8–12. However, for the majority of the identified loci, few
data are available concerning the manner on how these genetic
variants contribute to (i) the strict androgen-dependency of the
phenotype; (ii) the restriction of pathophysiological changes to
hair follicles in the frontal and vertex scalp regions; (iii)
characteristic
changes
in
hair
follicle
cycling
(anagen-
shortening/premature catagen entry); and (iv) the gradual
(mini-)organ transformation of pigmented terminal hair into
unpigmented vellus hair follicles4. Given the high heritability of
MPB (h2B80%; refs 13,14), and the fact that a significant fraction
of the overall heritable risk for MPB still awaits identification,
large-scale genetic studies are an important tool to elucidate the
molecular basis of MPB and to gain systematic insights into the
underlying pathobiology.
Here, we report the results of the largest genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) meta-analysis of MPB to date, that
comprised a total of 22,518 individuals from eight independent
GWAS samples of European descent. The analysis identifies 63
genome-wide
significant
loci
that
explain
B39%
of
the
phenotypic variance in MPB. More than one-third of these loci
(N ¼ 23) have not been reported previously. Our data highlight
highly plausible candidate genes and pathways that are likely to
contribute to key-pathophysiological characteristics of MPB such
as the deregulation of anagen-to-catagen transition (FGF5, EBF1,
DKK2, adipogenesis); increased androgen sensitivity (SRD5A2,
melatonin signalling); and the transformation of pigmented
terminal hair into unpigmented vellus hair (IRF4). Some of these
genes and pathways may represent promising targets for the
development of novel therapeutic options. In addition, our data
provide molecular evidence that MPB shares a substantial
biological basis with numerous other human phenotypes, which
may have major implications in terms of the evaluation of MPB
as an early prognostic marker for different phenotypes such as
prostate cancer, sudden cardiac arrest or neurodegenerative
disorders.
Results
Meta-analysis. Our meta-analysis of eight independent GWAS
samples of European descent (10,846 early-onset MPB cases,
11,672 controls; Supplementary Note 1; Supplementary Table 1)
identified a total of 63 genome-wide significant MPB-risk loci
(Po5 � 10 � 8, METAL), which account for B39% of the phe-
notypic variance in MPB (Fig. 1). These include 40 previously
reported and 23 novel MPB-risk loci (Table 1; Supplementary
Fig. 1). Regarding the genomic context of the 63 genome-wide
significant risk loci, the majority of the association peaks (N ¼ 45,
71%) mapped to intergenic regions. However, 60 (95%) of the
association peaks were located within r500 kb of a protein
coding gene, and a total of 18 (29%) association peaks mapped to
intronic or coding regions. Notably, six of the MPB-risk loci are
located on the X-chromosome, and may thus contribute to the
anecdotal similarity in hair status observed between men and
their maternal grandfathers. Among them are the well-established
AR/EDA2R-locus on Xq12, a locus near FAM9A and FAM9B on
Xp22.31 and two loci near KLF8 and TRS2 on Xp11.21. The
remaining 57 loci are located on the autosomes. Heritability
estimates on the liability scale were 0.14 (±0.03) for the
X-chromosome, and 0.34 (±0.12) for the autosomes.
Risk score analysis. To evaluate the potential value of these
association findings for the prediction of MPB risk, a weighted
genotype-risk score for MPB was constructed from the lead SNPs
of the 63 risk loci. The resulting score was divided into quartiles,
and the risk for MPB was tested in each quartile, using the lowest
quartile as a reference. As shown in Table 2, an increased risk for
MPB was observed across all quartiles, with a substantially
increased risk for MPB in quartile four (odds ratio (OR) ¼ 4.16,
95% confidence interval (CI) ¼ (2.03–8.55)). This effect was
even
stronger
after
adjustment
for
age
(OR ¼ 5.14,
95%
CI ¼ (2.44–10.86)), which underlines the strong age-dependency
of the trait.
Integration with mRNA and miRNA expression data. To
enable biological interpretation of the association findings and to
pinpoint plausible candidate genes, the genetic data were inte-
grated with own unpublished data on hair follicle mRNA-, and
micro(mi) RNA-expression, an unpublished expression quanti-
tative trait locus (eQTL) dataset from hair follicle (for details see
Supplementary Materials and Methods) and two published eQTL
data sets from skin and blood15,16. The comparison with eQTL
data sets revealed a colocalization of MPB-risk variants with
known
regulatory
variants
(r240.5
between
eQTL
single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and MPB lead SNP) in 25 loci.
For 10 of these 25 loci, previous studies have found an association
between the MPB lead SNP itself and gene expression for
example,
of
CRHR1,
which
encodes
for
a
receptor
for
corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH), a known hair growth
inhibitor and catagen inductor17, FAM53B a positive regulator of
WNT/beta-catenin-signalling18 and other genes, for example,
ANXA2, SUCNR1, WARS2 that have not yet been associated
with hair biology (Supplementary Table 2). Detailed functional
follow-up
studies
are
now
warranted
to
confirm
these
regulatory interactions, and to investigate the contribution
of these candidate genes to the development of key MPB
pathophysiological signs. A total of 19 association peaks (B30%)
were located within r500 kb of a miRNA gene. Eighteen of these
34 miRNA-genes were expressed in human scalp hair follicles,
and were predicted to target numerous mRNA genes at MPB-risk
loci
(Supplementary
Table
3).
Since
miRNAs
have
been
implicated in various aspects of hair biology, such as the
control of hair follicle cycling, keratinocyte differentiation/
proliferation and melanogenesis19, these miRNA-genes and
their target genes may constitute plausible candidate genes at
these MPB-associated loci.
DEPICT analysis and enhancer enrichment. The DEPICT
analysis (Supplementary Tables 4–6) and literature search iden-
tified highly plausible candidate genes, such as FGF5 at 4q21.21
(rs982804;
P ¼ 2.2 � 10 � 9,
METAL)
and
DKK2
at
4q25
(rs145945174;
P ¼ 1.3 � 10 � 13,
METAL).
FGF5
plays
an
important role in the regulation of anagen-to-catagen transition
and the control of human hair length20–22. DKK2 encodes for a
member of the family of dickkopf WNT-signalling inhibitors,
which are reported to be secreted by dermal papilla cells (DPCs)

 in response to androgens and to promote androgen-induced
(premature) anagen-to-catagen transition23,24. Notably, our data
indicated a nominally significant enrichment (Po0.05, 1 million
permutations) of credible MPB SNPs in enhancer regions from
DPCs (treated with dihydrotestosterone, DHT), which further
supports the hypothesis that DPCs are involved in MPB
aetiology25 (Fig. 2; Supplementary Data 1). An interesting focus
for future research will be to map androgen receptor (AR)
binding sites in DPCs and other hair-related cell types to test for
enrichment of MPB-risk variants.
Moreover, the strongest MPB-risk allele at 6p25.3 (rs12203592-T;
P ¼ 2 � 10 � 11, METAL) is located within a melanocyte-specific
enhancer element, and is reported to have a negative regulatory
effect on IRF4 expression. As IRF4 contributes to the pigmenta-
tion of human skin, hair and eye2,26,27, this locus is likely to
contribute to the gradual transformation of pigmented terminal
hair into unpigmented vellus hair in MPB28. In geographical
areas distant from the equator, less-pigmented skin, hair and eyes
have been under positive selection, presumably due to the fact
that this optimizes use of available ultraviolet radiation (UVR) for
vitamin D3 generation29. Thus, the association between this
functional IRF4 variant and MPB may contribute to the relatively
high prevalence of MPB in Europeans.
Another highly plausible candidate gene is located at 2p23.1.
Here, the most strongly associated SNP (rs9282858; P¼ 8.9� 10� 18,
METAL) represents a missense variant (c.145G4A; p.Ala49Thr)
in SRD5A2. This gene encodes for the 5-alpha-reductase type II
enzyme, which plays a critical role in androgen metabolism and
MBP pathobiology30. Interestingly, elevated SRD5A2 levels have
been detected in MPB affected scalp, and the SRD5A2 inhibitor
finasteride is an effective therapy for MPB31,32. Additional
candidate genes and their biological functions are summarized
in Table 1 and Supplementary Data 2.
Pathway-based analysis. Pathway-based analysis of genes at
MPB-risk loci revealed significant enrichment (P-value of the
right-tailed Fisher’s exact testo0.05) in 37 pathways, including
the previously implicated androgen metabolism and WNT-

 signalling pathways (Supplementary Table 7). In addition to these
known pathways, our data provide the first genetic evidence
for the involvement of additional hormonal pathways such as
epidermal growth factor (EGF)-signalling and oestrogen bio-
synthesis in MPB5,8,33–36. Enrichment was also found in
pathways that, to our knowledge have not been associated
previously with the key-pathophysiological signs of MPB such as
melatonin signalling/degradation, adipogenesis and immune
related pathways. Notably, both melatonin degradation and
adipogenesis are reported to interact with, and to be controlled
by, sex hormones37,38 and decreasing melatonin levels are a
potential marker of puberty progression39. These findings
highlight the indispensability of sex hormones to the MPB
phenotype40, and point to a novel potential link between
intrafollicular melatonin synthesis and its recognized effects on
oestrogen receptor expression and thus the sensitivity of human
scalp
hair
follicles
to
stimulation
with
oestrogens,
which
effectively counteract the anagen-shortening effects of DHT in
MPB development36,41.
Regarding adipogenesis, maturation of adipocyte precursors in
the skin is reported to occur in parallel with the activation of hair
follicle stem cells and to drive anagen induction and hair growth
during synchronized hair regeneration in mice42. However, few
data are available on whether and in what manner adipogenesis in
the skin may impact hair follicle cycling in humans. Notably,
adipogenesis and follicular stem cell activation are impaired in
mice lacking the gene EBF1, which is located at another MPB-risk
locus on 5q33.3, which suggest that adipogenesis plays a role in
healthy hair cycle regulation and MPB development in humans.
Regarding immunological processes, no conclusive data on their
role in MPB aetiology are yet available43. However, skin resident
macrophages contribute to the cyclic activation of adult hair
follicles via induction of WNT- and FGF5-signalling, which
were also implicated in the present meta-analysis44,45, and
perifollicular inflammatory infiltrates have long been suspected
to
participate
in
the
terminal-to-vellus
transformation
in
MBP46,47. Thus, our data represent the first genetic evidence
that
cells
residing
in
the
immediate
hair
follicle
micro-
environment impact on MPB development and may warrant
investigation as therapeutic targets.
Overlap with other human traits. On an epidemiological level,
early-onset MPB has been associated with several severe late-
onset somatic disorders, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD)48;
prostate hyperplasia and cancer49–51; Parkinson’s disease10; and
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis52. We therefore investigated a
possible genetic overlap between MPB and other phenotypes,
and compared our data to reported GWAS signals from the
NHGRI GWAS catalogue. The results are summarized in
Supplementary Data 3. A total of 124 GWAS catalogue entries
mapped to MPB-risk loci (r2Z0.3 and/or D040.8). These
included the above mentioned associations with hormone-
dependent traits and a reduced pigmentation of facial skin,
scalp hair and eyes. As regards to the well-established associations
between MPB and CVD and prostate cancer, a total of seven
overlapping associations were identified. These were found
between MPB and: (i) blood pressure (N ¼ 3); (ii) QT-interval
length (N ¼ 1); (iii) atrial fibrillation (N ¼ 1); (iv) sudden cardiac
arrest (N ¼ 1); (v) and prostate cancer (N ¼ 1). Here, our analysis
confirmed the positive epidemiological association between
prostate cancer and MPB at Xq12 (AR/EDA2R-locus), pointing
towards a shared pathophysiological mechanism that may involve
EDA2R-signalling and AR-transactivation53. Surprisingly, for the
majority of CVD GWAS SNPs, the direction of effect for MPB
and
CVD
differed,
thus
opposing
the
reported
positive
association between MPB and CVD at an epidemiological level.
This was not the case for the positive associations between MPB
and diastolic blood pressure at 4q21.21, and sudden cardiac arrest
at 12q13.12. Here, further analyses are warranted to elucidate the
exact underlying genes and biological pathways, and how they
relate to the epidemiological findings. Notably, while the 4q21.21
locus pointed towards a positive association between MPB and
diastolic blood pressure levels, opposite effect direction were
observed for a second overlapping association between these traits
on 5q33.3. This indicates that the effect direction of the genetic
correlation between two complex traits may differ between
individual loci or pathways. This finding highlights the need for
systematic studies to assess not only the quantitative genetic
overlap but also individual overlapping genetic factors and the
underlying genes and pathways. In addition, associations with
four loci were found for MPB and lower body height, which may
be driven by an accelerated progression of puberty and premature
induction of epiphyseal closure54. MPB-risk alleles at 17q21.31
and 6q22.32 were associated with increased bone mineral density,
which may be a consequence of optimized UVR-induced vitamin
D synthesis in subjects with MPB. This is consistent with the
observation that MPB-associated alleles confer a reduced risk for
immune related phenotypes, such as type 1 diabetes; multiple
sclerosis (MS); and rheumatoid arthritis (Supplementary Data 3).
An increased incidence of these diseases has been reported in
subjects with poor vitamin D intake and low serum vitamin D
levels55. Furthermore, a recent Mendelian-randomization study
by Mokry et al.56, found an association between genetically
lowered 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and increased susceptibility
to MS. Moreover, our data indicate shared genetic determinants
for MPB and a reduced risk for ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer,
and chronic lymphatic leukaemia, as well as overlapping
associations with progressive supranuclear palsy and decreased
intracranial volume. The indispensability of sex hormones for the
MPB phenotype is supported by the identification of overlapping
genetic association between MPB and other hormone-dependent
traits, such as an earlier age-at-onset of menarche in females and
earlier sexual maturation and higher serum androgen levels in
males (6q22.32, 16p13.12, Xp22.31)12,57–60.
Discussion
The present genome-wide meta-analysis identified 63 risk loci for
MPB, and highlights highly plausible candidate genes that are likely
to be implicated in the key-pathophysiological features of MPB,
such as deregulation of anagen-to-catagen transition (FGF5, EBF1,
DKK2, adipogenesis); increased androgen sensitivity (SRD5A2,
melatonin signalling); and transformation of pigmented terminal
hair into unpigmented vellus hair (IRF4). As demonstrated for
SRD5A2, the GWAS approach is a valuable tool for drug target
identification and the newly identified candidate genes and
pathways, perhaps most notably FGF5 and melatonin signalling
are promising targets for the development of novel therapeutic
options for MPB. In addition to confirming the involvement of
well-established pathways that control hormonal status (androgen
metabolism, oestrogen signalling) and hair follicle cycling (WNT-
signalling, EGF-signalling), our data support the importance of less-
well studied biological contexts, such as the involvement of
perifollicular macrophages and adipocytes.
Moreover, our data provide molecular evidence that rather
than being an isolated trait, MPB shares a substantial biological
basis with numerous other human phenotypes. This may have
major implications in terms of the evaluation of MPB as an early
prognostic marker for different phenotypes such as prostate
cancer, sudden cardiac arrest or neurodegenerative disorders, and
for the repurposing of existing drugs for use in MPB therapy. The
latter is illustrated by the fact that the efficacy of the two U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs, minoxidil

 and finasteride in MPB, was a serendipitous finding in patients
administered these medications for hypertension and prostate
hyperplasia. Finally, these novel insights into the genetic basis of
MPB and its association with other traits may help to elucidate
the evolutionary forces responsible for the relatively high
prevalence of MPB in the European population.
Methods
Study participants. Participants were drawn from eight independent genome-wide
association studies early-onset MPB samples: 23andMe (9,009 cases; 8,491 controls);
Bonn (581 cases; 416 controls); CoLaus (622 cases; 655 controls); Nijmegen Biome-
dical Study (145 cases; 247 controls); QIMRB1 (216 cases; 1,162 controls); QIMRB2
(59 cases; 498 controls); THISEAS (52 cases; 150 controls); and TwinsUK (163 cases;
210 controls). A detailed description of the studies and their phenotype definitions is
provided in Supplementary Note 1. All eight studies were approved by the respective
institutional ethics review committees (specified in Supplementary Note 1), and
written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to inclusion.
Genome-wide association analyses. A summary of the study specific genotyping
platforms, imputation methods and GWAS is provided in Supplementary Table 1.
For each of the eight studies fulfillment of the following two criteria was required:
(i) a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 41%; and (ii) a call rate of 498%, a variance
ratio of Z0.3 (MACH) or a proper info statistic of Z0.4 (IMPUTE2). Imputed
data were analysed using logistic regression and the dosage data options of either
PLINK or SNPTEST.
Meta-analysis. The present meta-analysis was performed in accordance with the
GWAS meta-analysis standards outlined in de Bakker et al.61 A fixed effects model
was used to combine the logistic regression effect estimates of individual studies
into a joint estimate, as implemented in METAL62. Results were cross-validated
using the respective implementations in METAINTER and YAMAS. The
Cochran’s Q statistics and the I2 measurement were used to test for cross-study
heterogeneity. P-values for the test of heterogeneity were calculated according to
Higgins et al.63 The meta-analysis included a total of N ¼ 8,004,650 SNPs that were
available in the 23andMe cohort and (i) at least four additional studies for non-X-
chromosomal SNPs, and (ii) three additional studies for X-chromosomal SNPs.
The QQ-plot of the meta-analysis and a plot of the across-study homogeneity are
shown in Supplementary Figs 2 and 3.
Identification of independent risk loci. SNP associations with a P-value of
o10 � 6 (METAL) were extracted from the meta-analysis and filtered for a het-
erogeneity P-value (PHet) of o0.01. SNPs separated by a distances of r100 kb on
the autosomes and r500 kb on the X-chromosome were assigned to the same
genomic region. Loci were considered to be significantly associated with MPB if at
least one SNP within the defined region showed an association to MPB at
Po5 � 10 � 8 (METAL) and (i) had a MAF of Z0.05; or (ii) was supported by at
least one SNP in linkage disequilibrium (LD; r240.5), with a MAF of Z0.05 and
an association with MPB at Po10 � 6 (METAL). MPB-risk loci were considered to
be independent if the lead SNPs of the regions showed an LD of r2o0.2.
Test for polygenicity. For the meta-analysis overall, an inflation factor of
l ¼ 1.303 was observed. After removal of LD-SNPs surrounding the two major loci
(chr20, chrX), the inflation decreased to l ¼ 1.20. After exclusion of all 63 asso-
ciated regions, the inflation decreased to l ¼ 1.16. This indicates that a relevant
proportion of the observed inflation is driven by genome-wide significant asso-
ciations. Furthermore, it is reasonable to assume from this finding that the
remaining inflation is driven primarily by true genetic association. This is con-
sistent with previous reports of a polygenetic contribution to MPB, and with
observations from meta-analyses of other complex genetic traits in which large
numbers of common risk factors were identified64,65. To determine whether the
inflation was attributable to polygenicity or to confounding factors, the LD score
regression method66 was applied using LD Score v1.0.0. The analysis confirmed
that most of the observed inflation is because of polygenicity (63.5%). The residual
genomic inflation is lGC ¼ 1.09, indicating that the observed association findings
are not due to population stratification.
To estimate the proportion of potentially-false positive findings, association
P-values (logistic regression) and effect directions for the 63 lead SNPs were
compared between the 23andMe cohort (23andMe) and a meta-analysis of the
remaining seven cohorts (MAwo23andMe) (Supplementary Table 8). For 62 of the
63 loci (98%) the analysis revealed a consistency of effect directions between
23andMe and MAwo23andMe. Of these loci, 76% (47/62) showed at least nominal
significant association to MPB in the MAwo23andMe study (METAL), with 72%
(34/47) also achieving significant association at Po0.05/63 ¼ 7.9 � 10 � 4 (METAL
P-value Bonferroni corrected for number of risk loci). Lastly, in contrast to the self-
report based phenotyping used in the 23andMe cohort, phenotyping in the Bonn
sample (BN) was based on clinical assessment. Thus for true positive association
findings, stronger effect sizes would be expected on average in the BN sample. This
was indeed the case: for 52 out of 61 lead SNPs available in the BN sample (85%)
which would be highly unlikely if these loci included a relevant proportion of false
positives. On the basis of these results, no correction was made for the residual
inflation. The level of significance of the 63 MPB lead SNPs after double GC
correction with the residual inflation factors from the LD score regression analyses
is however indicated in Table 1.
Definition of credible sets of SNPs. For each risk locus, a credible set of SNPs was
defined, as reported in Ripke et al.65 (Supplementary Table 9). In brief, here the
connection between the deviance and the single-variant test statistics is used to
calculate the probability that a specific variant is associated with MPB for the given set
of data. These probabilities are used to determine sets of variants within the risk loci—
that is, credible sets of SNPs—which contain the causal variant 99% of the time.
Estimation of heritability. The Bonn cohort was used to estimate the heritability of
MPB, since individual genotypes were available. All imputed variants with an
imputation info score of 40.6 were extracted, and the corresponding genotypes were
called using a probability threshold of 0.9. The resulting dataset comprised 997 male
individuals and 8,271,786 SNPs. Variants with a MAF of 40.01 and a genotype SNP-
call rate of 495% were then filtered. Only SNPs with a P-value of 45% for the
corresponding test of differences in missingness between cases and controls were
retained. After outlier detection with EIGENSTRAT based on autosomal data and the
exclusion of individuals based on a genetic similarity of 40.05, calculated by GCTA,
we obtained the Genetic Relationship Matrix (GRM) for the autosomes and the
X-chromosome with respect to 991 male individuals. With these two GRMs and 10
eigenvectors from the EIGENSTRAT step above, the heritability components were
estimated using GCTA. The estimated heritability on the observed scale was 0.666
(0.234) for the autosomes and 0.277 (0.054) for the X-chromosome (standard errors
in brackets). To obtain the estimated heritability on the liability scale, as described in
Lee et al.67, a straightforward extension of this transformation was used to account for
the extreme case and extreme control sampling. Table 2 in Hamilton68 was used to
divide the population into four bins. On the basis of age structure and Hamilton-
Norwood (HN) grade, the transformation was calculated under the assumption that
controls were selected from the first bin and cases from the last, thus reflecting the
extreme sampling scheme. The resulting factor was approximately 0.509. This
generated an estimated heritability for autosomal chromosomes of 0.339 (0.119), and
0.141 (0.027) for the X-chromosome.
Estimation of explained phenotypic variance. The amount of phenotypic var-
iance explained by the 63 genome-wide significant risk loci was estimated as the
correlation coefficient r2 in a multivariate linear model, in which the significant
index SNPs were predictors and the outcome was modelled as 1 ¼ case, 0 ¼ control.
Genotype-risk score analysis. Using the lead SNPs from the 63 genome-wide
significant loci, a genotype-risk score was constructed based on the weighted
number of susceptibility alleles in an independent replication sample from the
Heinz–Nixdorff Recall (HNR) cohort (N ¼ 1,201). Individuals with HN grade4II
(N ¼ 1,108) were defined as cases, and individuals with HN-grade I or II at age
o65 years were defined as controls (N ¼ 93). The weights were established using
the beta coefficient from the meta-analysis. The resulting genotype score was
divided into four quartiles. The risk for MPB was then tested in each quartile using
a logistic regression model and the lowest quartile as a reference. Two models were
tested: (I) genotype-risk score; and (II) age-adjusted risk score. The results of this
analysis are shown in (Table 2).
DEPICT analysis. DEPICT was used to identify plausible candidate genes at each
of the 63 risk loci. As recommended in Pers et al.69, all independent SNPs with a
P-value of o5 � 10 � 8 were included in the DEPICT analysis. Independent SNP
sets were generated by retaining the most significant SNP from each set of SNPs
with a pairwise LD of r240.1 and a physical distance of o500 kb. Pairwise LD
coefficients were computed based on the imputing panel used in the eight GWASs

 (1000 Genomes Project Phase I CEU, GBR and TSI genotype data). The results of
these analyses are shown in Supplementary Tables 4–6.
Identification of hair follicle eQTLs. DNA from peripheral blood and RNA from
occipital scalp hair follicle samples were obtained from 125 volunteer healthy male
donors of German descent (mean age 27.9 years). Genome-wide genotyping and
imputation of blood DNA samples were performed using Illumina’s Human
OmniExpress-12v1.0 bead array and IMPUTE2 (1000 Genomes, Phase I, June
2014). Whole-transcriptome profiling was performed on Illumina’s HT-12v4 bead
arrays after amplification and biotinylation of the hair follicle-RNA using the
TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Expression
data were quantile normalized, and only probes with a detection P-value of o0.01
(Illumina GenomeStudio Software) in at least 5% of the samples were taken into
account. The selected expression probes were subsequently filtered for: a unique
alignment to the transcriptome; a perfect or good probe quality, as reported in the
R package illuminaHumanv4.db; and mapping to an ENTREZ gene ID. After
quality control and filtering, data for 14,687 expression probes and 6,593,881 SNPs
were included in the eQTL analysis. Associations between gene expression levels
and SNP genotypes in cis (distance between SNP and expression probe r1 Mb)
was tested in MatrixEQTL using an additive linear regression model. Association
tests were corrected for the top five principle components. All eQTL findings at a
false discovery rate (FDR) of o0.001 were considered significant.
mRNA and miRNA expression analysis. Whole-transcriptome profiling of hair
follicle-RNA samples (N ¼ 125) was performed as described above. MiRNA pro-
filing of hair follicle samples (N ¼ 25) was performed on the AffymetrixGeneChip
miRNA 4.0 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) using a total of 250 ng of hair
follicle miRNA. Poly(A) tailing and biotinylation were performed with the
AffymetrixGeneChip Hybridization, Wash and Stain Kit, in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions. Data were analysed using the Affymetrix Expression
Console software (v.1.4) (Affymetrix). MiRNAs were defined as ‘present’
(N ¼ 1,169) or ‘absent’ (N ¼ 1,409) according to the implemented RMA
(robust multichip average) and DABG (detected above background) methods.
Identification of miRNA target genes at MPB-risk loci. MiRNA target genes at
MPB-risk loci (±500 kb from MPB lead SNP) were identified using the miR-
Walk2.0 algorithm (last accessed 24 March 2016). Only validated target genes and
genes that were predicted by the miRWalk algorithm and at least three additional
implemented databases were taken into account.
Overlap between eQTLs and MPB-risk variants. To identify regulatory effects at
known and novel MPB-risk loci, the present meta-analysis data were compared
with the eQTL data from: (i) the Blood eQTL Browser (http://genenetwork.nl/
bloodeqtlbrowser; last accessed on 21 December 2015); (ii) the GTEx Browser
(http://www.gtexportal.org/home); and (iii) an unpublished eQTL dataset from
human hair follicle. MPB-risk variants were considered to coincide with an eQTL if
the MPB lead SNP itself, or any SNP in r240.5, showed an eQTL effect. The
complete list of overlapping eQTL findings is provided in Supplementary Table 2.
Enhancer enrichment analysis. Enhancers (including promoters) were defined by
chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) peaks of histone 3 lysine 27
acetylation (H3K27ac). A total of 140 H3K27ac data sets were downloaded from the
roadmap epigenomics project (http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org), and repro-
cessed using DFilter. Only peaks with Po10� 10 (DFilter) were retained. Four in
house data sets from a human balding and a non-balding dermal papilla cell line with
and without 10 nM of DHT treatment were included70. In these lines, a H3K27ac
antibody (Abcam, Cat. ab4729; 5 mg antibody per 100 mg chromatin) was used for
ChIP. The MPB credible SNPs were overlapped with the enhancer (H3K27ac) sets of
each of the 144 cell lineages and tissues. For tissue (or cell lineage) A, the remaining
143 enhancer sets were pooled together to define a tissue agnostic superset. The
superset was classified in feature categories based on: (i) distance to transcription start
site; (ii) GC content; (iii) length of the enhancer site. To obtain for the enhancer set of
tissue A an appropriate null distribution, we randomly drew for every enhancer of
tissue A an enhancer from a matched feature category of the superset. The number of
credible SNP overlaps across this matched enhancer set was computed, and a million
permutations of feature matched enhancer sets were conducted and overlapped with
the credible SNP set to define a distribution for tissue A. This procedure was
conducted for each of the 144 tissue specific enhancer sets. For Fig. 2, enhancers of
cell lineages/tissues that belonged to the same tissue type were merged, resulting in 23
grouped enhancer sets. The above framework was repeated for these grouped
enhancer sets. The results of these analyses are provided in Supplementary Data 1.
Ingenuity pathway enrichment analysis. To test for an enrichment of MPB
candidate genes in canonical pathways, the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was used
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). IPA considers 658 pathways, and calculates enrich-
ment based on the right-tailed Fisher’s exact test. All genes within 500 kb of the
MPB lead SNPs were included in the analysis. Only pathways with Z3 annotated
genes were taken into account. The complete list of nominally significant pathways
is provided in Supplementary Table 7.
NHGRI GWAS catalogue. Previously reported GWAS associations that mapped
to the associated regions and showed an r2Z0.3 and/or D040.8 (1000 Genomes
Project, Phase 3) with the respective MPB index SNP were extracted from the
NHGRI GWAS catalogue (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/; last accessed on 14 January
2016). This resulted in the identification of 124 overlapping associations, as shown
in Supplementary Data 3.
