Background: Disruption of sleep and circadian rhythmicity is a core feature of mood disorders 
and may be associated with increased vulnerability to such disorders. Previous studies in this 
area have used subjective reports of activity and sleep patterns but the availability of 
accelerometer-based data in UK Biobank participants permits the derivation and analysis of new, 
objectively-ascertained circadian rhythmicity parameters. We aimed to examine associations 
between objectively–assessed circadian rhythmicity and mental health and wellbeing 
phenotypes, including lifetime history of mood disorder. 
Methods: Wrist-worn accelerometry data from 91 105 participants of the UK Biobank cohort 
were used to derive a circadian relative amplitude variable, which is a measure of the extent to 
which circadian rhythmicity of rest-activity cycles is disrupted. In the same sample, cross-
sectional associations between low relative amplitude and mood disorder, wellbeing and 
cognitive variables were examined in a series of regression models.  
Findings: A quintile reduction in relative amplitude was associated with increased risk of lifetime 
major depressive disorder (MDD) (odds ratio (OR) = 1·06, 95% CI 1·04, 1·08) and lifetime bipolar 
disorder (OR = 1·11, 95% CI 1·03, 1·20), as well as with greater mood instability, higher 
neuroticism score, more subjective loneliness, lower happiness, lower health satisfaction, and 
slower reaction times. These associations were independent of demographic, lifestyle, education 
and overall activity confounders. 
Interpretation: Circadian disruption is reliably associated with a range of adverse mental health 
and wellbeing outcomes, including MDD and BD. Lower relative amplitude may be linked to 
greater vulnerability to mood disorders.

Research in context  
Evidence before this study 
Although circadian disruption is likely to be a core feature of mood disorders such as major 
depression and bipolar disorder, studies to date have tended to assess sleep-related factors or 
subjective reports of circadian preferences (e.g., eveningness/morningness) which may be 
indirectly related to circadian rhythmicity. We searched Web of Science for studies of objectively-
measured circadian rhythmicity and mood disorders published before May 2017, using the 
search terms “accelerometry”/”actigraphy”, “circadian” “amplitude” and “bipolar” or 
“depression”. We identified 17 articles that compared accelerometry-derived measures of 
circadian amplitude between healthy controls and mood disorder patients or those at risk of 
mood disorder, or correlated depressive/manic symptoms with amplitude. Most studies reported 
lower amplitude in depressed and bipolar patients or high-risk individuals compared to controls, 
but different definitions of circadian amplitude were employed across these studies, sample sizes 
were almost universally small, and most studies did not control for potential confounders such 
as lifestyle factors and overall activity levels. Additional searches did not reveal any studies 
examining objectively-measured circadian rhythmicity and subjective wellbeing.  
 
Added value of this study 
This study provides the first large-scale investigation of the association of objectively-measured 
circadian rhythmicity with a range of mental health, wellbeing, personality and cognitive 
outcomes, with an unprecedented sample size of over 90 000 participants. Previous studies have 
typically examined simple group differences adjusting for no or very few confounders, whereas 
we found that circadian relative amplitude is reliably associated with depression, bipolar and 
subjective wellbeing, personality and cognitive measures, even after adjusting for a wide range of 
sociodemographic, lifestyle, education and activity covariates.  
 
Implications of all the available evidence 
Circadian disruption is a core feature of the mood disorders depression and bipolar disorder, and 
is likely also to be associated with risk factors for mood disorder, including impaired subjective 
wellbeing, neuroticism and mood instability. Accelerometry-derived measures of relative 
amplitude may be associated with greater vulnerability to mood disorder.

Introduction 
Circadian rhythms are variations in physiology and behaviour that occur in cycles with a 
predominantly 24-hour period. They are ubiquitous in nature and are fundamental for health and 
homeostasis. Integrity of circadian rhythmicity is critical for mental health and wellbeing, and 
certain forms of disruption are associated with mood disorders, particularly major depressive 
disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD).1 Although several studies have identified associations 
between disrupted circadian rhythmicity and adverse mental health outcomes,2,3 much of this 
work has limitations, which include relatively small or highly selected samples, minimal 
adjustment for confounders, and subjectively-reported measures of circadian function such as 
chronotype (preference for evening or morning activity). 
The objective assessment of patterns of rest and activity using accelerometry in over 90 000 
participants of the UK Biobank cohort represents an unprecedented opportunity to test the 
association between disrupted circadian rhythmicity and a range of mental health disorders.4,5 
The depth and breadth of data collected as part of the UK Biobank project also make it possible 
to control for a wide range of potential confounders within multivariable models.  
Here we report the first large-scale population cohort assessment of the relationship between 
circadian function and mood disorders, both MDD and BD. We employed a commonly-used 
metric: relative amplitude (RA), which reflects the relative difference between the most active 
10-hour period (M10) and the least active 5-hour period (L5) in an average 24-hour period.6 In 
secondary analyses, we also assessed for association between circadian rhythmicity and several 
phenotypes that are known to be related to mood disorders, including neuroticism, mood 
instability, subjective wellbeing and cognitive function (assessed via reaction time).  
 
Methods 
Participants and ethical approval 
Over 502 000 United Kingdom (UK) residents aged 37-73 years were recruited to the UK Biobank, 
a general population cohort, from 2006-2010. At any one of 22 assessment centres across the UK, 
participants completed a range of lifestyle, demographic, health, mood, cognitive and physical 
assessments and questionnaires.4 Accelerometry data were collected from a subset of more than 
100 000 participants in 2013-2015, and around 160 000 participants completed an online Mental 
Health Questionnaire (MHQ) in 2016-2017. Here, we used data from the 91 105 participants who 
provided accelerometry data that passed quality control (details below) and who had data on all 
covariates in base models and on at least one dependent variable, after exclusion of participants 
self-reporting sleep apnoea or insomnia (n=343). Characteristics of participants with low RA of 
 5 
 
>2 standard deviations (SD) below the sample mean, and those with higher RA, are presented in 
Table 1. Characteristics of participants meeting criteria for lifetime MDD, lifetime BD and controls 
are shown in Table S1. Participants provided informed consent, and UK Biobank received ethical 
approval from the North West Multi-centre Research Ethics Committee (11/NW/03820). The 
current analyses were conducted under UK Biobank application number 26209 (PI Wyse).  
Measurement of predictors 
Accelerometry data collection and pre-processing 
In 2013, 240 000 UK Biobank participants were invited to wear an accelerometer for seven days 
as part of a physical activity monitoring investigation. Of these, 103 720 (43%) accepted, and 
returned the accelerometer to UK Biobank after use. Participants who accepted the invitation 
received a wrist-worn Axivity AX3 triaxial accelerometer in the post and were asked to wear the 
device on their dominant wrist continuously for seven days, while continuing with their normal 
activities. The start of accelerometry data collection was on average 5·70 years (SD = 1·13) after 
the initial baseline assessment. At the end of the seven-day period, participants were instructed 
to return the accelerometer to UK Biobank using a prepaid envelope.  
Data pre-processing was conducted by the UK Biobank accelerometer expert working group: for 
details see ref. 5 and http://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/crystal/refer.cgi?id=131600. An overall 
acceleration average in milli-gravity (mg) units (UK Biobank field ID 90012) was calculated by 
the working group and was used in partially and fully adjusted models to control for overall 
activity levels.  
 
Circadian relative amplitude measure 
RA is the relative difference between the most active continuous 10-hour period (M10) and the 
least active continuous 5-hour period (L5) in an average 24-hour period,6 and is a common non-
parametric measure of the amplitude of rest-activity rhythms.3  RA was calculated from physical 
activity intensity data (average vector magnitude; mg) in 5 s epochs (UK Biobank field ID 90004), 
using Clocklab (Actimetrics) and the following formula: 
RA = 
(𝑀10−𝐿5)
(𝑀10+𝐿5) 
M10 and L5 are the average activity during the continuous 10- or 5-hour period containing the 
maximum or minimum, respectively, overall activity counts in each 24-hour recording period 
(midnight to midnight). Data were first averaged by minute. Onset times of the M10 and L5 
periods were identified by moving a 10- or 5-hour window in steps of 1 minute to identify the 
continuous overlapping period containing either the 10 most or 5 least active hours (on 
 6 
 
average).7  The mean M10 and L5 activity values across all included 24-hour periods were used 
to calculate each individual’s RA value.  
RA ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values reflecting clearer distinction between activity levels 
during the most and least active periods of the day. Lower values result from reduced daytime 
activity and/or increased night-time activity. Accelerometry-derived activity measures have 
demonstrated good validity and reliability.8 Mean RA was 0·87 (SD=0·06; range 0·121-0·997), 
similar to previously reported values in healthy populations.3 RA values were however negatively 
skewed (see Figure S1).  
Using data quality metrics provided by the UK Biobank accelerometer working group5, 
participants who provided accelerometry data for less than 72 hours or did not provide data for 
all one-hour periods within the 24-hour cycle were excluded. Participants were also excluded if 
their data was identified by UK Biobank as having poor calibration, or calibration that, due to 
insufficient data, was performed using data from the previous or subsequent participant to use 
the same accelerometer. We excluded participants with data flagged by UK Biobank as unreliable 
(unexpectedly small or large size) and participants whose wear-time overlapped with a daylight 
savings change.  
Demographic and lifestyle variables 
At the baseline assessment, participants provided data on demographic characteristics including 
age, ethnicity, educational attainment and lifestyle. Townsend social deprivation scores9 were 
derived based on postcode of residence, with negative scores reflecting relatively greater 
affluence. Smoking status (‘never’, ‘previous’, ‘current’) and frequency of alcohol intake (‘never’; 
regularly (‘1-2 times a week’/‘3-4 times a week’); occasionally (‘1-3 times a month’/‘special 
occasions only’); daily (‘daily/almost daily’)) were derived from a touchscreen lifestyle 
questionnaire. For smoking and alcohol variables, ‘never’ was used as the reference category. BMI 
was calculated from measurements of height (m) and weight (kg) using weight/height2.  
During an online MHQ conducted in 2016-2017 (details below), participants completed one item 
from each of five subscales (emotional abuse; physical abuse; sexual abuse; emotional neglect and 
physical neglect) of the brief Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.10 Statements related to each 
subscale were rated on a 5-point scale from ‘never true’ to ‘very often true’. Using established 
thresholds,11 participants were categorised as meeting criteria for childhood trauma vs. 
no/subthreshold childhood trauma.  
 
 7 
 
Measurement of mood, wellbeing and cognitive dependent variables 
Primary mental health-related dependent variables were lifetime MDD and lifetime BD: 
participants were classified as meeting criteria for MDD/BD or not based on responses to the 
online MHQ. Secondary wellbeing and cognitive dependent variables were self-reported mood 
instability, neuroticism scores, self-rated happiness and health satisfaction, self-reported 
loneliness, and reaction time.  
In 2016, an average of 7·55 years (SD = 0·93) after the baseline assessment, and 1·85 years (SD = 
0·65) years after accelerometry data recordings, 337 799 UK Biobank participants were invited 
to complete an online MHQ (‘Thoughts and Feelings’) designed to assess lifetime symptoms of 
mental disorders. As of May 2017, 157 751 participants had completed the questionnaire.  
Participants met criteria for lifetime MDD if they reported ever having had a period of persistent 
low mood or anhedonia (at least two weeks, lasting at least most of the day, almost every day) 
which interfered with everyday life or activities and involved at least five symptoms from: low 
mood, anhedonia, fatigue, weight change, sleep changes, difficulty concentrating, feeling 
worthless, thinking about death. Participants were categorised into the control (no lifetime 
depression) group if they responded ‘No’ to ever having had a period of low mood or anhedonia 
lasting at least two weeks, or if they reported a period of low mood or anhedonia which involved 
less than five symptoms from the above list. Participants were excluded from the control group if 
they self-reported a diagnosis of depression, if they had missing data for at least one depressive 
symptom question or if they reported recent (past two weeks) depressive symptoms lasting at 
least several days. Questions within the MHQ were derived from the Composite International 
Diagnostic Interview – Short Form.12  
Participants who completed the MHQ were classified as having lifetime BD if they reported a 
period of intense irritability or feeling ‘high’, ‘hyper’ or ‘excited’ that lasted at least a week and 
which was associated with at least four features from: ‘more active’, ‘more talkative’, ‘needed less 
sleep’, ‘more creative/more ideas’, ‘more restless’, ‘more confident’, ‘thoughts were racing’, ‘easily 
distracted’. Participants were categorised as controls (no lifetime BD) if a) they reported never 
having experienced a period of irritability or feeling ‘high’, or b) if they did report such a period 
but it lasted less than a week; or fewer than four of the above manic features were reported. 
Participants were excluded from the control group if they met criteria for probable BD based on 
the baseline mental health questionnaire (2006-2010),13 or if they self-reported a diagnosis of 
mania, hypomania, BD or manic depression. Participants who met criteria for both MDD and BD 
were categorised into the lifetime BD group.

Further MHQ questions asked participants to rate their subjective happiness (‘In general how 
happy are you?’) and health satisfaction (‘In general how satisfied are you with your health?’) 
from 1 (‘extremely happy’) to 6 (‘extremely unhappy’). For ease of interpretation, happiness and 
health satisfaction scores were reversed so that higher scores reflected greater satisfaction.  
At baseline (2006-2010), participants were asked ‘Do you often feel lonely?’. ‘Yes’/’no’ responses 
were examined as a further wellbeing (loneliness) dependent variable. An aggregate neuroticism 
score was calculated for participants who completed all 12 questions from the Eysenck 
Personality Questionnaire Revised (Short Form; EPQ-R-S) Neuroticism Scale at baseline.14 The 
score represents the number of questions answered in the affirmative (range 0-12). One of the 
neuroticism questions concerned mood instability (‘Does your mood often go up and down?’), 
and ‘yes’/’no’ responses on this question were examined as a separate dependent variable.  
Participants completed several brief cognitive tests via a touchscreen interface at the baseline 
assessment. Here we focussed on the reaction time task as this was administered throughout the 
baseline assessment period. Participants viewed 12 ‘rounds’ of 12 pairs of images of cards, and 
pressed a button when the two cards matched, similar to the game ‘Snap’. Response times of 
under 50 ms or over 2000 ms were excluded and for each participant a mean reaction time was 
calculated across all correct responses, after excluding the first two rounds. Due to positive skew, 
analyses were conducted both on raw and log-transformed reaction times: as results were 
equivalent, raw reaction time results are reported for ease of interpretation.  
 
Statistical analyses 
Associations between the RA predictor and each mental health, wellbeing and cognitive 
dependent variable (lifetime MDD, lifetime BD, mood instability, neuroticism, self-rated 
happiness, health satisfaction, loneliness and reaction time) were examined in three separate 
regression models, each adjusting for progressively more potential confounders. 
Continuous RA scores were first inverted by multiplying by -1, orienting the association estimates 
towards the influence of lower RA on dependent variables. As a one-unit change in RA would 
reflect the difference between the extreme lower and upper ends of the range, scores were 
divided into quintiles, and regression models examine the effects of RA quintile (higher quintiles 
reflect lower RA) on dependent variables. Continuous effects of standardised RA scores were also 
examined after first normalising the distribution by raising scores to the fourth power: results 
were equivalent to the quintile method and so for ease of interpretation, results using the quintile 
method are reported.  
 9 
 
Associations between RA quintile and binary measures of lifetime MDD, BD, mood instability and 
loneliness were examined using logistic regression, and ordinal logistic regression was employed 
for the self-rated happiness and health satisfaction variables: odds ratios (OR) are reported. 
Linear regression was employed for reaction time (linear regression coefficients reported). 
Negative binomial regression was employed for models examining neuroticism, as this count-
based variable had a skewed distribution, and incidence rate ratios (IRR) are reported. Robust 
standard errors were employed for all models. 
Base models (‘Model 1’) examined associations between RA quintile and dependent variables, 
adjusting for age and season at the time of commencing accelerometry (spring = Mar-May; 
summer = Jun-Aug; autumn = Sep-Nov; winter = Dec-Feb; UK Meteorological Office definitions), 
sex, ethnicity (white or non-white) and Townsend score.  ‘Model 2’ adjusted for these covariates 
in addition to lifestyle and activity factors: smoking status, alcohol intake, educational attainment 
(degree or no degree), overall mean acceleration recorded by accelerometry (UK Biobank field ID 
90012), which represents mean activity levels, and BMI, due to suggestions that high BMI may be 
causally linked to depression.15 Model 3 adjusted for all Model 2 covariates in addition to a binary 
measure of childhood trauma. Childhood trauma is an important risk factor for mood disorder 
and poorer wellbeing,11 but as trauma data were available for only a subset of participants (n= 64 
272), this was examined in a separate model to allow maximising of sample size in Model 2. 
Sociodemographic and lifestyle covariates were selected on the basis of prior associations with 
circadian disruption and/or mental health-related variables. To maximise sample sizes, available-
case analyses were employed: sample sizes for each model are reported in results tables. 
Reporting of analyses and results followed TRIPOD guidelines where applicable.16

Results 
After exclusion of participants with self-reported sleep disorders (sleep apnoea or insomnia), or 
with poor quality or unreliable accelerometry data, 91 524 participants remained. Of these, 91 
105 participants also had complete data on covariates included in base models as well as on at 
least one of the dependent variables, and formed the study sample. Characteristics of this sample, 
and numbers with missing data on dependent variables and covariates are displayed in Table 1: 
 10 
 
participants showing low RA of >2SD below the sample mean are compared with the remaining 
participants. The percentage in this group (3·82%) is greater than the 2·28% expected for a 
normal distribution due to negatively skewed RA scores (Figure S1). In Table S1, characteristics 
of participants meeting criteria for lifetime MDD and lifetime BD are compared to controls.   
Measurement of lifetime MDD, lifetime BD, happiness and health satisfaction variables took place 
an average of 1·85 years (SD=0·65) after accelerometry recordings. Mood instability, neuroticism, 
loneliness and reaction time variables were collected an average of 5·70 years (SD=1·10) before 
accelerometry data. A boxplot of (reversed) raw RA scores is displayed in Figure S2. In fully 
adjusted regression models (Model 3), lower RA quintile was associated with increased odds of 
lifetime MDD (Model 3: OR = 1·06, 95% CI 1·04, 1·08), BD (OR = 1·11, 95% CI 1·03, 1·20), mood 
instability (OR = 1·02, 1·01, 1·04), and with higher neuroticism scores (IRR = 1·01, 95% CI 1·01, 
1·02) after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, education, activity, BMI and childhood trauma 
covariates (Table 2).  
Lower RA was associated with lower subjective ratings of happiness (OR = 0·91, 95% CI 0·90, 
0·93) and health satisfaction (OR = 0·90, 95% CI 0·89, 0·91), with higher odds of reporting 
loneliness (OR = 1·09, 95% CI 1·07, 1·11) and with slower reaction time (coefficient = 1·75, 95% 
CI 1·05, 2·45) after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, education and activity covariates and BMI 
and childhood trauma. All results were comparable in terms of direction and significance, but 
with larger ORs, for Model 1 (adjusting for sociodemographic covariates) and Model 2 (adjusting 
for sociodemographic, lifestyle, education, activity and BMI). 
To assess whether effects for non-clinical dependent variables were driven by participants with 
mood disorders, analyses were repeated after excluding 16 916 participants meeting criteria for 
lifetime MDD or BD based on MHQ responses, or on self-report. Results are shown in Table S2. 
After exclusion of participants with mood disorders and after adjusting for lifestyle, activity, BMI 
(Model 2) and trauma (Model 3), the association between RA and mood instability was no longer 
significant (Model 3: OR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00, 1.03, p = 0.124). All other results were unchanged: 
in Models 1-3, lower RA quintile was associated with increased odds of self-reported loneliness 
(Model 3: OR = 1·11, 95% CI 1·08, 1·14), higher neuroticism scores (IRR = 1·01, 95% CI 1·01, 
1·02), slower reaction time (coefficient = 1·54, 95% CI 0·74, 2·34) and lower subjectively-rated 
happiness (OR = 0·91, 95% CI 0·90, 0·93) and health satisfaction (OR = 0·90, 95% CI 0·88, 0·91).  
 
Discussion 
Lower circadian relative amplitude (RA) was associated with greater risk of mood disorder and 
with poorer subjective wellbeing. Lower RA is a rhythmicity measure reflecting less marked 
 11 
 
differences in activity profiles between daily rest and activity periods, and was associated with 
increased odds of lifetime MDD and BD. Lower RA was also associated with greater odds of mood 
instability and self-reported feelings of loneliness, with higher neuroticism scores, reduced self-
rated happiness, lower health satisfaction and slower reaction time. These associations were 
independent of a range of demographic, lifestyle, activity and childhood trauma variables, and 
associations with all wellbeing, personality and cognitive variables (apart from mood instability) 
remained after exclusion of participants with lifetime history of mood disorder. 
Findings that low RA is associated with increased odds of MDD and BD are consistent with 
suggestions that circadian rhythm disruption is a core feature of mood disorders and with 
previous, smaller investigations reporting lower RA in individuals with BD.3 Lower RA reflects 
reduced distinction, in terms of activity levels, between active and rest periods of the day. This 
can reflect reduced activity during waking periods, often seen in depressive episodes; increased 
activity during rest periods, linked to sleep disturbances which are common in mood disorder, or 
a combination of both. This ‘flattening’ of the rest-activity cycle is thought to reflect disrupted 24-
hour circadian rhythmicity and less entrainment to external zeitgebers.17  
Reduced RA has been reported in healthy individuals scoring highly on mania scales and in 
healthy relatives of individuals with BD.18 We provide the first direct evidence of associations 
between objectively-measured circadian disruption and neuroticism and mood instability, which 
have both been consistently linked to higher risk of mood disorder. Effect sizes for mood 
instability and neuroticism were small, so the clinical relevance of these associations is unclear. 
Furthermore, associations between RA and mood instability were attenuated after exclusion of 
participants meeting criteria for mood disorder, suggesting the association may have been partly 
driven by greater mood instability in participants with psychiatric conditions. However, as the 
association of neuroticism with RA remained after exclusion of participants with probable MDD 
and BD, this is consistent with suggestions that circadian disruption is associated with increased 
vulnerability to mood disorders.18  
Associations between low RA and reduced self-rated happiness, health satisfaction and increased 
subjective loneliness indicate that circadian disruption is more generally associated with 
impaired subjective wellbeing, particularly as these associations persisted after exclusion of 
participants reporting lifetime mood disorder. The direction of causality, and indeed the presence 
of a causal relationship between circadian disruption and wellbeing is however unclear from the 
current cross-sectional data.  
Deficits in memory, reaction time and attention have been reported after sleep deprivation and 
in shift workers.19,20 Our work extends previous findings by demonstrating within a large 
population-based cohort that objectively-measured circadian disruption is associated with 
 12 
 
slower reaction time independent of demographic, lifestyle and activity covariates. Reaction time 
shows consistent associations with higher general intelligence and white matter integrity and is 
often considered a general marker of neurocognitive functioning.21,22 Our findings support the 
view that impairments to this functioning are associated with circadian disruption. 
Due to the cross-sectional nature of the data, the current findings cannot speak to the issue of 
causal associations between circadian disruption and poorer mental health and wellbeing 
outcomes. This is compounded by the temporal separation between recording of baseline 
demographic and lifestyle variables (2006-2010), accelerometry data (2013-2014) and the MHQ 
(2016-2017), particularly as reaction time, neuroticism and loneliness data were collected before 
accelerometry data. Our goal was to assess for evidence of cross-sectional associations rather 
than to infer causality, but future work following up on the participants with accelerometry data 
will be useful in elucidating the nature and direction of causality. As the UK Biobank cohort 
matures, future studies will be able to examine the extent to which low RA can predict new 
diagnoses of mood disorders (although this possibility may be limited by the age of the UK 
Biobank cohort) or new depressive/manic episodes in patients with existing mood disorder 
diagnoses. The collection of further accelerometry data in the same participants would be useful 
in this regard, as it would allow examination of whether within-participant changes in RA can 
predict onset of novel episodes and whether stabilisation of objectively-measured rhythmicity is 
associated with improved mental health, cognitive and wellbeing outcomes. Mendelian 
Randomisation analysis using alleles associated with circadian disruption may be able to examine 
evidence for causal associations between circadian disruption and mental health and wellbeing 
outcomes.23 
As rest-activity rhythms differ between younger and older adults, associations between circadian 
rhythmicity and mental health and wellbeing may differ in cohorts which are younger than UK 
Biobank. As the circadian system undergoes developmental change during adolescence,24 a 
common time for onset of mood disorders, longitudinal study of rhythmicity in younger 
populations and comparison with findings in the UK Biobank may aid understanding of causal 
mechanisms. 
Overall, our findings suggest a reliable association between circadian disruption and both risk of 
mood disorder and worse subjective wellbeing outcomes. This study also highlights the potential 
utility of accelerometry-derived relative amplitude in serving as a marker of vulnerability to 
negative mental health and wellbeing outcomes. RA is relatively cheaply and easily measured, 
and may be useful in identifying those at greater risk of MDD or BD, or sub-groups of patients 
who might benefit from therapies aimed at improving circadian rhythmicity.

*Logistic regression was employed for lifetime MDD, lifetime BD, mood instability and loneliness models, and ordinal logistic regression for happiness and health satisfaction 
models: for these models, coefficients reflect odds ratios (OR). Negative binomial regression was employed for neuroticism scores and so coefficients reflect incident rate ratios 
(IRR). Linear regression was employed for reaction time: linear regression coefficients are reported· As RA scores were inverted, estimates reflect the influence of lower RA 
on outcomes. Model 1 adjusted for age and season when commencing accelerometry, sex, ethnicity and Townsend score. Model 2 additionally adjusted for alcohol intake 
frequency, smoking status, degree, overall mean acceleration and BMI. Model 3 additionally adjusted for childhood trauma. BD = bipolar disorder; CI = confidence interval; 
MDD = major depressive disorder· N refers to the total sample size, or sample size for cases; controls where applicable (i·e·, where outcomes are binary) McFadden’s pseudo 
R2 is reported for all models aside from reaction time, where adjusted R2 is reported. ·
