Abstract 
Sauna bathing has been linked with numerous health benefits. Sauna bathing may reduce the risk of 
respiratory diseases; however, no prospective evidence exists to support this hypothesis. We aimed to 
assess the association of frequency of sauna bathing with risk of respiratory diseases (defined as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, or pneumonia). Baseline sauna bathing habits were assessed in a 
prospective cohort of 1,935 Caucasian men aged 42-61 years. During a median follow-up of 25.6 years, 
379 hospital diagnosed incident cases of respiratory diseases were recorded. In adjustment for several 
major risk factors for respiratory conditions and other potential confounders, the hazard ratios (HRs) 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) of respiratory diseases were 0.73 (0.58-0.92) and 0.59 (0.37-0.94) for 
participants who had 2-3 and ≥ 4 sauna sessions per week respectively compared with participants who 
had ≤ 1 sauna session per week. The multivariate adjusted HR (95% CI) for pneumonia was 0.72 (0.57-
0.90) and 0.63 (0.39-1.00) for participants who had 2-3 and ≥ 4 sauna sessions per week respectively. 
Frequent sauna baths may be associated with a reduced risk of acute and chronic respiratory conditions in 
a middle-aged male Caucasian population.

Introduction 
Sauna bathing has for thousands of years been regarded as a traditional activity in Finland and mainly 
used for pleasure and relaxation. The use of sauna is increasingly becoming common in many other 
countries.(1) Sauna bathing has been linked with many health benefits and these include improvement in 
the pain and symptoms associated with musculoskeletal diseases;(2) treatment of chronic headache; (3) 
and amelioration of skin diseases such as psoriasis and urticaria.(4) Recent emerging evidence also 
suggests that sauna bathing  is associated with lowered risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD),(5) 
neurocognitive disease,(6) and all-cause mortality.(5) Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), 
pneumonia, and asthma are debilitating respiratory diseases, which are commonly characterized by chest 
symptoms such as pain and tightness, cough, and shortness of breath. Chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease is a progressive obstructive lung disease and has recently been named as the third leading cause of 
mortality globally.(7) Asthma is a long-term inflammatory disease of the airways of the lungs and causes 
about 250,000 to 345,000 deaths per year globally.(8) Pneumonia is a common inflammatory condition, 
which primarily affects the alveoli of the lungs and is responsible for considerable morbidity and as well 
as mortality.(9) These common respiratory diseases are disabling conditions which are associated with 
reduced quality of life and high economic costs.(10) Majority of cases of these respiratory conditions can 
be prevented through decreased exposure to their underlying risk factors which commonly include 
smoking, exposure to pollution and environmental chemicals, and coexisting comorbidities diseases such 
as diabetes.(10). 
 In addition to the accumulating beneficial effects of sauna bathing on several vascular and non-
vascular outcomes, sauna bathing has also been suggested to improve lung function and the symptoms of 
lung disease.(11) Waon therapy, which is also a form of heat therapy, has been suggested to improve 
airway obstruction in patients with COPD.(12) Given the overall evidence, we hypothesized that sauna 
bathing may be linked to lowered risk of respiratory diseases. In this context, our aim was to evaluate the 
prospective association between frequency of sauna bathing and the risk of respiratory diseases (as 
 4 
 
defined as COPD, asthma, or pneumonia), using a population-based prospective cohort study which 
comprised of 1,935 Caucasian men, who were apparently free from any respiratory diseases at baseline.  
 
Methods 
Participants in the study were men aged 42-61 years recruited into the Kuopio Ischemic Heart Disease 
(KIHD) study in eastern Finland, which has been described in detail previously.(5, 6) Briefly, subjects 
were a randomly selected sample of 3,433 men who resided in the town of Kuopio or its surrounding rural 
communities. Of those invited, 2,682 volunteered to participate in the study and those with complete 
information on sauna bathing were included (N=2,327). There were only 12 men who did not use sauna 
and were excluded from the analysis. Baseline sauna bathing were assessed by a self-administrated 
questionnaire which included assessment of the weekly frequency and duration of sauna sessions, as well 
as the temperature of the sauna bath. The assessment represented an average sauna use during the week. 
The questionnaires were cross-checked by an experienced nurse at the time of baseline examination.(5, 6)  
Baseline examinations were conducted between March 1984 and December 1989. Collection of blood 
specimens and measurements of relevant covariates have been described previously.(5, 6) Briefly, 
participants fasted overnight, were instructed to abstain from drinking alcohol for at least 3 days, and 
refrain from smoking for at least 12 h prior to assessment. Baseline demographics, lifestyle 
characteristics, prevalent diseases, the level of physical activity, and socioeconomic status (SES) were 
assessed by self-administered questionnaires.(5, 6) In the KIHD study, participants are under annual 
continuous monitoring for deaths and incident outcomes including respiratory diseases using unique 
personal identification numbers (PINs). All incident respiratory diseases diseases (defined as COPD, 
asthma, or pneumonia) that occurred from study entry to 2014 were included and these were collected by 
automatic record linkage to the National Hospital Discharge Register, which covers every hospitalization 
in Finland. The diagnosis of respiratory diseases was coded according to the International Classification 
of Diseases codes. An independent committee of physicians reviewed all potential cases to obtain a 
 5 
 
consensus on the diagnosis and etiology. For the current analysis, all men with respiratory diseases 
(chronic bronchitis, asthma, or tuberculosis) at study entry (n=344) were excluded, leaving 1,935 men at 
baseline for the current analysis. The ethical committee of the University of Eastern Finland approved the 
study protocol. Hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox 
proportional hazard models, after confirmation of the assumptions of the proportionality of hazards. 
Follow-up time was calculated from date of study entry to date of outcome diagnosis or end of follow-up. 
Participants were classified into three groups based on the frequency of sauna bathing (≤1, 2-3 and ≥ 4 
times per week).(5, 6) All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata version 14 (Stata Corp, College 
Station, Texas). 
 
Results 
The overall mean [standard deviation (SD)] age and BMI of study participants at baseline were 53 (5) 
years and 27 (4) kg/m2 respectively. The median (interquartile range) frequency and mean (SD) duration 
of sauna bathing was 2 (1-3) times per week and 14.0 (7.2) minutes per sauna bath (Table 1). During a 
median (interquartile range) follow-up of 25.6 (17.2-27.7) years, a total of 379 hospital diagnosed 
incident respiratory diseases were recorded (incidence rate of 8.92 per 1000 person-years at risk; 95% CI 
8.06 to 9.87). In analyses adjusted only for age, when compared to participants who had ≤ 1 sauna session 
per week, the HRs of respiratory diseases were 0.66 (95% CI: 0.53 to 0.82) and 0.49 (95% CI: 0.31 to 
0.77) for participants who had 2-3 and ≥ 4 sauna sessions per week respectively. After further adjustment 
for several risk factors (body mass index, smoking status, histories of diabetes and coronary heart disease, 
years of education, and alcohol consumption), the respective HRs were minimally attenuated to 0.68 
(95% CI: 0.55 to 0.86) and for 0.53 (95% CI: 0.34 to 0.84). The significant association persisted on 
additional adjustment for total energy intake, SES, physical activity, and C-reactive protein, 0.73 (95% 
CI: 0.58 to 0.92) and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.37 to 0.94) for 2-3 and ≥ 4 sauna sessions per week respectively 
(Table 2). In analysis that further adjusted for duration and temperature of sauna baths, the HRs were 
 6 
 
0.74 (95% CI: 0.58 to 0.93) and 0.61 (95% CI: 0.38 to 0.98) for 2-3 and ≥ 4 sauna sessions per week 
respectively. A total of 919 deaths occurred during follow-up. Analysis with death as a competing risk 
event yielded HRs of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.57 to 1.34) and 1.00 (95% CI: 0.50 to 1.98) for 2-3 and ≥ 4 sauna 
sessions per week respectively. In a test of interaction, the association of frequency of sauna bathing with 
risk of respiratory diseases was not modified by smoking (current smokers versus others) (p-value for 
interaction = 0.119). In a subsidiary analysis with pneumonia as a separate outcome, the multivariate HRs 
of pneumonia were 0.72 (95% CI: 0.57 to 0.90) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.39 to 1.00) for participants who had 
2-3 and ≥ 4 sauna sessions per week respectively. There was no evidence of an independent association 
between duration of a single sauna bathing session and risk of respiratory diseases. 
 
Comment 
Based on a population-based prospective cohort of middle-aged Caucasian men who had no apparent pre-
existing respiratory diseases at baseline, we have found out that frequency of sauna bathing is inversely 
associated with future risk of respiratory diseases in a graded fashion. The association remained robust 
after adjustment for several risk factors for these respiratory conditions, as well as the duration and 
temperature of sauna baths. However, given the high mortality rate in our study cohort which might have 
hindered our event of interest, the association between frequency of sauna bathing and respiratory 
diseases was attenuated when death was modelled as a competing risk event. The association between 
frequency of sauna bathing and respiratory diseases was not modified by smoking status. A subsidiary 
analysis showed frequency of sauna bathing to be inversely associated with the risk of pneumonia. 
Inflammatory processes are well known to be involved in the pathogenesis of these respiratory 
conditions,(10, 13) though their etiopathogenesis involves an interaction of both genetic and 
environmental factors.  Accumulating evidence also shows that oxidative stress and damage play a pivotal 
role in the pathogenesis of these respiratory conditions.(14) The ability of sauna baths to decrease the risk 
of respiratory diseases may be explained via its ability to reduce oxidative stress.(15) The heat associated 
 7 
 
with sauna baths may also have direct effects on the lung tissue by reducing pulmonary congestion and 
increasing tidal volume, vital capacity, ventilation, and forced expiratory volume of the lungs.(11) The 
current findings add to the accumulating knowledge on the beneficial effects of sauna baths on both acute 
and chronic health conditions. Sauna bathing is an enjoyable and relaxing activity, has a good safety 
profile, and well-tolerated by most people.(5, 6) Dry sauna bathing seems to be safe even among patients 
who have recovered from myocardial infarction (MI) and patients with stable angina pectoris or heart 
failure can enjoy sauna baths without any significant adverse cardiovascular effects. However, individuals 
who are prone to orthostatic hypotension, unstable angina pectoris, recent MI or severe aortic stenosis 
should exercise caution while using the sauna.(16) Though the public health implications of the current 
findings may seem limited in populations where sauna use is not common; it is expected that sauna 
bathing as a recreational activity will increase globally given the emerging evidence on its potential health 
benefits. Well designed trials are needed to evaluate the therapeutic implications of sauna bathing on 
pulmonary conditions and explore the mechanistic pathways underlying the associations. 
This is the first prospective evaluation of the association between frequency of sauna bathing and risk 
of respiratory diseases in a general population-based sample of men who were free of any respiratory 
diseases at study entry. There were no losses to follow-up and the analysis adjusted for a comprehensive 
panel of several risk factors for respiratory diseases. The limitations of the current study include the 
limited data on specific respiratory conditions such as COPD and asthma which precluded the ability to 
assess the associations with these outcomes separately, the inability to generalize the findings to women 
and other populations, and the inability to correct for regression dilution bias which may have 
underestimated the associations demonstrated, as we only had a one-time questionnaire-based assessment 
of sauna bathing habits during a typical week. Sauna bathing habits may have changed during follow-up 
due to probable changes in health habits or other diseases; however, sauna bathing is a traditional Finnish 
habit and the greater majority of people have regular sauna baths irrespective of their age.

In conclusion, higher frequency of sauna bathing may be associated with a decreased risk of acute and 
chronic respiratory diseases in middle-aged Caucasian men. Further research is needed to replicate these 
findings and explore the biological processes underlying the relationship.
