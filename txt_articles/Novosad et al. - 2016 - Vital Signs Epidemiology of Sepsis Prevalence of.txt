Abstract
Background: Sepsis is a serious and often fatal clinical syndrome, resulting from infection. Information on patient 
demographics, risk factors, and infections leading to sepsis is needed to integrate comprehensive sepsis prevention, 
early recognition, and treatment strategies.
Methods: To describe characteristics of patients with sepsis, CDC and partners conducted a retrospective chart review 
in four New York hospitals. Random samples of medical records from adult and pediatric patients with administrative 
codes for severe sepsis or septic shock were reviewed.
Results: Medical records of 246 adults and 79 children (aged birth to 17 years) were reviewed. Overall, 72% of 
patients had a health care factor during the 30 days before sepsis admission or a selected chronic condition likely 
to require frequent medical care. Pneumonia was the most common infection leading to sepsis. The most common 
pathogens isolated from blood cultures were Escherichia coli in adults aged ≥18 years, Klebsiella spp. in children aged 
≥1 year, and Enterococcus spp. in infants aged <1 year; for 106 (33%) patients, no pathogen was isolated. Eighty-two 
(25%) patients with sepsis died, including 65 (26%) adults and 17 (22%) infants and children.
Conclusions: Infection prevention strategies (e.g., vaccination, reducing transmission of pathogens in health care 
environments, and appropriate management of chronic diseases) are likely to have a substantial impact on reducing 
sepsis. CDC, in partnership with organizations representing clinicians, patients, and other stakeholders, is launching a 
comprehensive campaign to demonstrate that prevention of infections that cause sepsis, and early recognition of sepsis, 
are integral to overall patient safety.

Introduction
Many different infections can lead to sepsis, a serious and often 
fatal clinical syndrome that is characterized by organ dysfunction 
and can be difficult to diagnose (1–3). Sepsis is associated with 
high morbidity and mortality (1–4) and accounted for $23.7 
billion in health care expenditures in 2013 (5). Identifying 
specific sepsis prevention strategies is a public health priority.
Evaluations of sepsis epidemiology have typically used death 
certificate or health services utilization data; these methods have 
well-described limitations (6,7). Most sepsis initiatives have 
focused on improving outcomes by promoting protocol-driven 
approaches that facilitate early recognition and treatment (8). 
Detailed data regarding underlying conditions, health care fac-
tors, types of infections, and pathogens most commonly associ-
ated with sepsis could guide development of programs to inform 
clinicians, patients, and families about prevention of infections 
that can lead to sepsis. To inform sepsis initiatives and health 
communication efforts, CDC partnered with the New York 
State Department of Health and Emerging Infections Program 
to perform a medical record assessment to describe clinical 
characteristics, comorbidities, and potential opportunities for 
infection prevention among patients with sepsis.
Methods
A retrospective medical record review at four general, 
acute care hospitals in New York was performed through 
CDC’s Emerging Infections Program. Patients were eligible 
for inclusion if they had a hospital admission during 
October 1, 2012–September 30, 2013 (fiscal year [FY] 
2013), or October 1, 2014–September 30, 2015 (FY 2015). 
The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, 
Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) discharge diagnosis codes 
for severe sepsis (995.92) or septic shock (785.52) were used 
by hospitals to generate lists of potential cases. A target sample 
On August 23, 2016, this report was posted as an MMWR Early Release on the MMWR website (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr).

size of approximately 300 records was selected. The lists of 
medical records were sorted into random order, and samples 
of records were selected and reviewed to identify demographic 
characteristics, underlying conditions, and infections leading to 
sepsis. Patients’ demographic and clinical characteristics were 
abstracted using a standardized form. Patients whose medical 
records did not include documentation of sepsis and patients 
for whom large portions of the medical record were incomplete 
or missing were excluded.
The first date of clinical documentation of sepsis or a related 
term in the chart by a clinician was used to classify sepsis 
cases. The timing of first sepsis documentation was used as a 
proxy for sepsis onset, and the presence of health care factors 
prior to the sepsis hospitalization was used to classify cases 
as community- or health care–associated. Cases were classi-
fied as community-associated/community-onset if the initial 
documentation of sepsis occurred at admission or during the 
first 3 calendar days of admission, with the date of admission 
considered to be day 1, and if, during the 30 days preceding 
admission, there were no health care factors (i.e., ≥2 days in a 
nursing home, long-term or other acute care hospital, receipt of 
intravenous antimicrobials, peritoneal or hemodialysis, surgery, 
total parenteral nutrition, chemotherapy, wound therapy, or 
presence of a central venous catheter). Community-associated/
community-onset cases were further categorized based on 
whether the patient had one or more of a number of selected 
chronic conditions that might require frequent contact with 
health care providers for management.*
Sepsis cases were classified as health care–associated if 
the initial documentation of sepsis occurred ≤3 days after 
admission and health care factors were identified during the 
preceding 30 days; they were further categorized as nurs-
ing home-onset, community-onset, or undetermined-onset, 
depending on the location from which the patient was admitted 
to the hospital. Sepsis cases for which the first documentation 
of sepsis occurred after day 3 of admission were classified as 
health care–associated/hospital-onset. A descriptive analysis 
of demographics, clinical characteristics, underlying chronic 
conditions, pathogens, and infection types among patients 
with sepsis was performed.
Results
Adult patients with sepsis. Charts of 290 adult patients 
with sepsis were selected, and reviews were completed for 246 
(85%); 44 (15%) records were excluded, most commonly 
because encounter information was missing. The median age 
of adult patients with sepsis was 69 years; 127 (52%) were 
male (Table 1). The median length of hospital stay was 9 days. 
Most patients (238 [97%]) had at least one comorbidity; 
87 (35%) had diabetes mellitus, 79 (32%) had cardiovas-
cular disease (including coronary artery disease, peripheral 
vascular disease, or congestive heart failure), 56 (23%) had 
chronic kidney disease, and 50 (20%) had chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease. The most common illnesses leading 
to sepsis were pneumonia (85 [35%]), urinary tract infections 
(62 [25%]), gastrointestinal infections (28 [11%]), and skin/
soft tissue infections (26 [11%]) (Table 2). Pathogens were 
isolated from blood cultures of 75 (30%) patients and from 
urine cultures of 70 (28%); these groups were not mutually 
exclusive. The most common pathogens identified from blood 
were Staphylococcus spp. (including both S. aureus and coagulase 
negative Staphylococcus), Escherichia coli, and Streptococcus spp. 
(Table 3). For 76 (31%) patients with sepsis, no pathogen was 
identified in any culture or nonculture based tests.
Among the 246 adult patients with sepsis whose records were 
reviewed, 142 (58%) were classified as health care–associated 
with 44 (18%) of these hospital-onset and 104 (42%) were 
classified as community-associated, without health care factors. 
Among health care–associated sepsis cases, the most common 
health care factors were acute care hospitalization or nursing 
home stays of ≥2 days in the preceding 30 days, which were 
reported for 44 (18%) and 43 (17%) patients, respectively. 
Among patients with community-associated sepsis, nearly 
50% (20% of all patients with sepsis) had a selected chronic 
condition likely to lead to frequent encounters with health 
care providers, such as diabetes mellitus with complications, 
cancer, or congestive heart failure. Pneumococcal vaccination 
before the sepsis hospitalization was documented for 108 
(44%) patients, and influenza vaccination in the year before 
admission was documented for 87 (35%) patients.
Among the 155 patients admitted from a private residence, 
23 (15%) were discharged to a long-term care facility. Sixty-five 
(26%) patients died during their sepsis hospitalization, includ-
ing 47 (representing 72% of deaths) who were aged ≥65 years, 
and seven (representing 11% of deaths) who had no health care 
factors in the 30 days preceding admission.
Pediatric patients with sepsis. Records of 88 pediatric 
patients with sepsis were selected for review, and reviews were 
completed for 79 (90%), including 31 infants aged <1 year 
(39%), and 48 children, aged 1–17 years (61%) (Table 1). 
At least one comorbidity was present for 62 (78%) pediatric 
patients, including 25 (81%) infants and 37 (77%) children. 
The most common comorbidity among infants was congenital 
heart disease, affecting seven (23%) patients; the most com-
mon comorbidities among children were cognitive deficits or 
cerebral palsy, affecting 18 (38%).
* Selected chronic conditions included any of the following: steroid/
immunosuppressive therapy, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, cerebral 
palsy, hemiplegia, spinal cord injury, paraplegia, quadriplegia, congestive heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, chronic ventilator/
tracheostomy, leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, neutropenia, transplant 
(hematopoietic and solid organ), solid tumor (metastatic and not metastatic), 
sickle cell disease, cirrhosis, or diabetes mellitus with complications.

Among pediatric patients, 34 (43%) had sepsis with health 
care factors, and 45 (57%) were community-associated sepsis 
cases without health care factors (Table 1). The most commonly 
identified health care factor, receipt of intravenous antibiotics 
in the 30 days preceding sepsis admission, was reported for 
eight (10%) patients. Selected chronic conditions (Table 1) 
likely to require frequent medical care were identified in eight 
(10%) community-associated cases.
Among infections leading to sepsis, respiratory infec-
tions were most common, and preceded sepsis in 29% of 
all pediatric patients, followed by gastrointestinal infections 
(24%) (Table 2). Among 41 (52%) patients for whom a 
pathogen was identified in a blood culture, Enterococcus spp. 
and Klebsiella spp. were most commonly identified in infants 
(14%) and children (9%), respectively (Table 3). In 30 (38%) 
pediatric patients, sepsis was diagnosed but no pathogen was 
isolated. Seventeen (22%) pediatric cases died during their 
sepsis hospitalization, including 12 (39%) infants and five 
(10%) children.

Conclusions and Comments
The findings from this analysis will inform expansion of 
efforts by CDC and partners to describe the epidemiology 
of sepsis, prevent infections that lead to sepsis, and educate 
clinicians and patients about reducing the risk for sepsis. 
Patients with sepsis experience severe illness and serious adverse 
outcomes, including long hospital stays (median = 10 days), 
discharge to long-term care settings (20%), and death (25%). 
Similar to other studies (1,9,10), sepsis most commonly 
occurred among patients with one or more comorbidities, and 
a majority of patients developed infections leading to sepsis 
outside a hospital. Among all patients with sepsis, 72% had 
either a health care factor in the month preceding admission 
or a chronic condition likely to require frequent contact with 
the health care system, suggesting that opportunities exist for 
prevention or earlier recognition of infections leading to sepsis. 
Although multiple infections and organisms among patients 
with sepsis were identified in this study and in others (2,11,12), 
in many cases a specific pathogen is not determined.
Because different types of infections can lead to sepsis, many 
interventions that are currently viewed as pathogen-specific or 
disease-specific should also be considered opportunities to pre-
vent sepsis and included in efforts to improve sepsis education. 
For example, pneumonia is the most common infection causing 
sepsis (2,11,12), and vaccination is an important and highly 
effective prevention strategy. Pneumococcal and influenza 
vaccination have both been shown to have saved thousands 
of lives, despite suboptimal vaccination coverage in the U.S. 
population; thousands more deaths could be prevented with 
better coverage (13–16).
Among those patients for whom sepsis onset was determined, 
79.4% were classified as having sepsis onset outside of the 
hospital (i.e., first medical record documentation of sepsis 
at admission or in the first 3 hospital days). The majority 
of patients in this analysis had recent interactions with the 
health care system before admission. While this likely reflects 
the vulnerability of chronically ill patients to infection, it also 
suggests that health care facilities and providers could play a 
central role in sepsis prevention by providing age-appropriate 
and condition-appropriate vaccination to all patients and 
optimizing the health status of patients with chronic condi-
tions. In addition, facility-level interventions are available to 
reduce the risk for health care–associated infections, such as 
appropriate hand hygiene and personal protective equipment to 
limit pathogen spread among patients. The potential impact of 
facility-level interventions is demonstrated through awareness 
and prevention efforts focused on infections caused by central 
line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABSIs). During 
1990–2010, it is likely that as many as 198,000 CLABSIs 
were prevented in intensive care units, attributable at least

in part to the successful and widespread implementation of 
evidence-based CLABSI prevention measures (17). Finally, 
efforts to reduce exposure to antibiotic-resistant organisms and 
disruption of the protective normal microbiome should also 
be included among sepsis prevention strategies.
Sepsis prevention activities led by CDC and partners are 
focused on five key areas: 1) increasing sepsis awareness among 
patients, families, and providers and building a coalition of 
clinical professional partners and patient advocates to work with 
CDC; 2) promoting early recognition of sepsis and aligning anti-
biotic stewardship efforts with early recognition; 3) identifying 
at-risk populations for prevention and early recognition efforts; 
4) developing better sepsis surveillance methods to measure the 
impact of interventions; and 5) preventing infections that lead 
to sepsis, including infections caused by antibiotic-resistant 
pathogens. These efforts are being coordinated with partners 
to reduce sepsis risk, improve patient outcomes, and track 
progress. Recent sepsis initiatives focused on early recognition 
and treatment include legislation passed in 2014 in New York 
requiring hospitals to report a variety of sepsis process measures 
to the New York State Department of Health, and the Centers 
for Medicare & Medicaid Services implementation in 2015 of 
a new policy instrument to improve sepsis care increasing the 
use of specific and timely medical interventions during the first 
few critical hours that patients with sepsis are in the hospital 
or emergency room (18). In addition, the Society for Critical 
Care Medicine and the European Society of Intensive Care 
Medicine recently published guidelines intended to improve 
early recognition of sepsis (3).
The findings in this report are subject to at least five limita-
tions. First, the assessment examined medical records from 
a small sample of patients and hospitals; characteristics of 
patients with sepsis could be different elsewhere, although 
these results are consistent with previous studies. Second, a 
sample of adult and pediatric records were reviewed, and the 
numbers of records are not proportional to the actual num-
ber of adult and pediatric patients with sepsis in these facili-
ties. Third, to identify patients with sepsis and septic shock, 
administrative codes were used along with confirmation that 
at least one provider had documented sepsis in the medical 
record, rather than application of an objective definition based 
on physiological or laboratory criteria. Therefore, although 
this approach has obvious limitations, it reflects the clinical 
impression of treating providers. Fourth, because this analysis 
relied on medical records for all information, data might be 
incomplete. Information on outpatient clinic visits was not 
collected; therefore, the proportion of patients with sepsis 
who have health care factors before their sepsis hospitalizations 
might have been underestimated. Finally, in many patients 
more than one infectious process was present, and it is possible 
that not all of the infections and organisms described actually 
caused sepsis in an individual patient.
Sepsis is a significant public health and clinical management 
challenge. CDC continues to work closely with numerous 
clinical professional organizations and patient advocates and 
will partner with stakeholders to launch a comprehensive 
campaign targeting clinicians and the public, demonstrating 
how steps to prevent and urgently recognize sepsis are critical 
components of patient safety programs. Routine health care 
encounters should be used as opportunities to implement 
interventions that could reduce the risk for infections leading 
to sepsis. These interventions include increasing vaccination 
coverage, educating patients and families about early sepsis 
warning signs, improving infection control programs, and 
optimizing chronic disease management. In addition, current 
efforts led by CDC and partners to improve sepsis surveillance 
will enhance analysis of risk factors and infections leading to 
sepsis and provide a more objective measure to track trends and 
evaluate interventions, informing overall prevention, recogni-
tion, and treatment efforts.
