 Abstract 
54 
BRCA1/2 germline mutations predispose to breast cancer by impairing homologous recombination (HR) causing 
55 
genomic instability. HR also repairs DNA lesions caused by platinums and PARP inhibitors. Unselected Triple 
56 
Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) harbour a sub-population with BRCA1/2 mutations, hypothesised to be 
57 
especially platinum sensitive. Additional putative “BRCAness” subgroups may also be especially platinum 
58 
sensitive. We assessed carboplatin and mechanistically distinct docetaxel in a phase III randomised trial in 
59 
unselected advanced TNBC. A pre-specified correlative biology programme enabled biomarker-treatment 
60 
interaction analyses in BRCA1/2 mutation associated breast cancer (gBRCA-BC) and putative BRCAness 
61 
biomarker subgroups: tumour BRCA1 methylation; BRCA1 mRNA-low; HR deficiency mutational signatures 
62 
and basal phenotypes. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR) . In the unselected population (376 
63 
patients randomised; 188 carboplatin, 188 docetaxel) carboplatin was not more active than docetaxel (ORR: 
64 
31.4 v 34.0; p=0.66). In contrast in patients with gBRCA-BC carboplatin was highly active with double the 
65 
ORR compared to docetaxel (68% v 33%), test for biomarker-treatment interaction (p=0.01). No treatment 
66 
interaction was observed for BRCA1 methylation, BRCA1 mRNA-low status or a Myriad HRD mutation 
67 
signature assay. Significant treatment interaction with basal-like subtype was driven by high docetaxel response 
68 
in the non-basal subgroup. We conclude TNBC patients benefit from BRCA1/2 mutation characterization, but 
69 
not BRCA1 methylation or Myriad HRD analysis. Basal-like gene expression analysis may also influence 
70 
treatment choices. 
71 
72 
   
73 
“Triple negative” breast cancer (TNBC) describes the 10-20% of tumours which are estrogen receptor (ER), 
74 
progesterone receptor (PgR) and HER2 negative. A single TNBC entity is however a fallacy masking 
75 
considerable histological and biological heterogeneity, understanding of which is needed to optimise therapy 
76 
selection. Outcome for patients with recurrent/advanced TNBC is especially poor1. Chemotherapy is the only 
77 
approved systemic therapy and, while considered biologically unselective, can have distinct mechanisms of 
78 
action that target specific biological mechanisms aberrant in cancer. When accompanied by mechanism relevant 
79 
biomarkers, use of a specific chemotherapeutic in defined populations might be considered a “targeted” therapy.  
80 
 
81 
Whilst genomic classifiers suggest the majority of TNBCs are of basal intrinsic subtype2,3, recent analyses 
82 
suggest that TNBC can be sub-classified4-6. An immunohistochemical (IHC) approximation of the basal intrinsic 
83 
subtype has been termed “core basal”7. A common feature of sporadic basal TNBC is genomic instability with 
84 
mutational and rearrangement signatures indicative of abnormalities in DNA repair and replication stress that 
85 
overlap BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation associated signatures8. Abnormalities also exist in BRCA1 mRNA 
86 
expression, largely driven through methylation of the BRCA1 promoter 9,10 as observed in ovarian cancer11,12. 
87 
This, and the overlap in mutational signatures8, suggest functional deficiency of homologous recombination 
88 
(HR) DNA repair genes as a shared characteristic between BRCA1 familial breast cancers and a substantial, but 
89 
incompletely defined, subgroup of TNBC. BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins have important roles in DNA 
90 
replication fork stabilisation and HR13 and are components of the Fanconi anaemia protein network14,15. The 
91 
hallmark of deficiency in this network is sensitivity to DNA crosslinks induced by platinums and mitomycin 
92 
C16,17. Historically platinum chemotherapies have only shown modest activity in advanced breast cancer 
93 
excepting those with chemotherapy naïve disease18,19.  
94 
 
95 
No trial had directly studied platinum therapy responses in comparison to standard of care in advanced 
96 
unselected TNBC, its majority basal subtype or subgroups of TNBC with features of aberrant BRCA1/2 
97 
associated function or “BRCAness”20. TNT was designed to compare the activity of the standard of care 
98 
microtubule agent docetaxel with the DNA cross-linking agent carboplatin. We hypothesised greater activity for 
99 
carboplatin in DNA damage response deficient subgroups. As strong mechanistic evidence existed for the 
100 
efficacy of platinum DNA salts on cells with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, accrual of patients known to have 
101 
these germline mutations was allowed, irrespective of ER, PgR and HER2 status. We pre-specified analyses of 
102 
 i) germline mutation carriers and putative “BRCAness”21 TNBC subgroups with ii) BRCA1 promoter DNA 
103 
methylation and/or mRNA-low and basal forms of the TNBC defined by iii) gene or iv) protein expression. 
104 
 
105 
Methods 
106 
 
107 
Study design 
108 
Conducted in 74 hospitals throughout the UK TNT was a phase III, parallel group, open label randomised 
109 
controlled trial with pre-planned biomarker subgroup analyses. Trial sponsorship, governance, randomisation 
110 
procedures and balancing factors are described in the supplementary appendix.  
111 
 
112 
Patients 
113 
Eligible patients had to be considered fit to receive either study drug and have measurable, confirmed advanced 
114 
breast cancer unsuitable for local therapy with histologically confirmed ER, PgR, and HER2 negative primary 
115 
invasive breast cancer with Allred/quick score <3 or H score <10 or locally determined ER and PgR negative, if 
116 
other cut-offs used (e.g., 1%, 5% or 10%).  HER2 negative was defined as immunohistochemistry scoring 0 or 
117 
1+ for HER2, or 2+ and non-amplified for HER2 gene by FISH or CISH. Patients could be ER and HER2 
118 
negative and, PgR negative/unknown, or any ER, PgR and HER2 status if known to have BRCA1 or BRCA2 
119 
germline mutation and otherwise eligible (full eligibility criteria in supplementary appendix). Although patients 
120 
with TNBC hypothesised to have BRCAness phenotypes were the primary interest, patients with unselected 
121 
TNBC as well as those with BRCA1 or BRCA2 germline mutations were recruited to allow interaction testing of 
122 
biomarker positive and negative populations in relation to response to each of these mechanistically distinct 
123 
agents. Patients provided written informed consent.  
124 
 
125 
Procedures 
126 
Patients were allocated ( 1:1 ratio) between six cycles of carboplatin (AUC 6), day 1 3-weekly, and six cycles of 
127 
docetaxel (100mg/m2), day 1 3-weekly. For patients responding to and tolerating treatment well, a further two 
128 
cycles could be given subject to local policy. Further details of chemotherapy and supportive medicines are 
129 
described in the supplementary appendix. Patients were offered six cycles of the alternative (“crossover”) 
130 
treatment upon progression or where allocated treatment was discontinued due to toxicity (“pre-progression 
131 
crossover”). Subsequent management was at clinician discretion.  
132 
  
133 
Tumour assessment by CT scan was performed after three and six cycles (or at treatment discontinuation if 
134 
earlier) and three-monthly thereafter until disease progression. Response was assessed as best response by 
135 
RECIST.  
136 
 
137 
Sample analyses 
138 
For consenting patients, one blood sample and archival primary invasive carcinoma, lymph nodes and any 
139 
recurrent tumour specimens, or a research biopsy from a metastatic site, were collected. There was no 
140 
requirement for a recurrent specimen to be provided. DNA was extracted using standard methodology. Central 
141 
review of ER, PgR and HER status was performed at KCL (further details in supplementary appendix). 
142 
 
143 
Germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation analysis was conducted and status for subgroup analysis was centrally 
144 
determined at The Institute of Cancer Research. Genomic DNA from blood white cell preparations was analysed 
145 
for BRCA1 and BRCA2 for intragenic mutations and exon deletions and duplications throughout the coding 
146 
sequence, and intron-exon boundaries was completed in all cases. This was either performed by Sanger 
147 
sequencing together with multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) or by next-generation 
148 
sequencing using the Illumina TruSight Cancer Panel v1. All intragenic mutations were confirmed by separate 
149 
bi-directional Sanger sequencing. All exon deletions or duplications were confirmed by MLPA. The mutation 
150 
nomenclature was in accordance with clinical convention with numbering starting at the first A of the ATG 
151 
initiation site, using BRCA1  LRG_292_t1 and BRCA2 LRG_293_t1. 
152 
 
153 
The DNA methylation status of the regulatory region of BRCA1 was determined using bisulfite sequencing and 
154 
BRCA1 mRNA expression level from total-RNA-sequencing from archival primary carcinoma (see 
155 
supplementary appendix Figure S3 and  Supplementary Table S5). 
156 
 
157 
The Myriad HRD test includes three DNA-based measures of homologous recombination deficiency including: 
158 
whole genome tumour loss of heterozygosity profiles (LOH), telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI) and large-scale 
159 
state transitions (LST)22-24. All three scores are highly correlated with defects in BRCA1/2 and hypothesized to 
160 
be associated with sensitivity to platinum agents. The HRD score is calculated as the sum of the three individual 
161 
scores 25. As part of the HRD assay, the sequencing data are used to call BRCA1/2 mutations in the tumour, 
162 
 either germline or somatic.  The supplementary appendix includes description of HRD assay on TNT trial 
163 
samples. 
164 
 
165 
Primary cancers were classified into basal-like subtypes by several classifiers including an IHC panel7, and 
166 
Prosigna26 (further details in supplementary appendix). Integration of transcriptional and whole genome 
167 
chromosomal instability, rearrangement and mutational signatures that have been associated with BRCA1 or 
168 
BRCA2 mutation and BRCA1 methylation and may specifically interact with carboplatin response 8,22-25,27-29 
169 
were protocol pre-specified as a priori sub-groups analyses are incomplete and will be reported elsewhere.  
170 
 
171 
All genomics data reported in this manuscript will be available for public access. 
172 
 
173 
Outcomes 
174 
The primary endpoint was objective tumour response rate (complete or partial). The version of RECIST 
175 
reporting criteria used for tumour assessment was documented and, where possible, cases assessed using 
176 
RECIST version 1.0 were subsequently reassessed locally according to RECIST version 1.1. An independent 
177 
Response Evaluation Committee at study completion reviewed reported responses centrally (local assessment 
178 
was used for primary analysis).  
179 
 
180 
Secondary endpoints included progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), response to crossover 
181 
treatment (as per primary endpoint), tolerability and safety.  
182 
 
183 
Adverse events were assessed throughout treatment; graded according to National Cancer Institute Common 
184 
Toxicity Criteria (version 3·0) and coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
185 
(MedDRA version 14·0) with central clinical review (by the Chief Investigator) at study completion. 
186 
 
187 
Statistical analyses 
188 
Evidence to inform sample size calculations was scarce; however ECOG 210030 suggested a 20-30% response 
189 
rate for single agent taxane. TNT was designed on the premise of demonstrating superiority of carboplatin with 
190 
a 15% improvement in response rates designated as clinically important. Assuming 90% power and type I error 
191 
 �=0·05 (two-sided), a sample size of at least 370 patients was required. The protocol recognised a priori that 
192 
equivalence of response, accompanied by reduced toxicity with carboplatin, would also impact clinical practice. 
193 
 
194 
Response rates were compared using Fisher’s exact tests and logistic regression (see supplementary appendix 
195 
section 4.11 for further details regarding analysis of subgroups).  Survival endpoints were displayed using 
196 
Kaplan Meier plots and survival analysis modelling utilised restricted mean survival methodology31 given that 
197 
the proportionality of hazards assumption required for Cox survival analysis did not hold.  
198 
 
199 
Principal efficacy endpoints were analysed according to intention to treat (ITT) including all 376 patients 
200 
randomised and according to pre-planned biomarker subgroups (Table S1); additional analysis groups and 
201 
associated analysis methods are detailed in the supplementary appendix. Analyses are based on a database 
202 
snapshot taken on 7 March 2016 and performed using STATA 13.  
203 
 
204 
Results 
205 
Between 25 April 2008 and 18 March 2014 376 patients (188 allocated to carboplatin and 188 to docetaxel) 
206 
entered the trial, all patients were included in the analysis of the primary endpoint (Figure 1); the trial population 
207 
largely comprised patients with TNBC and no known BRCA1/2 mutation (338/376) and baseline characteristics 
208 
typical of patients with first line relapse of TNBC (Table S2/S3). There were 43 patients with germline 
209 
BRCA1/2 mutation (31 BRCA1 and 12 BRCA2 Table S2). Of the 31 BRCA1 mutation carriers XX had ER+ve  
210 
disease and of the 12 BRCA2 mutation carriers XX had ER+ve disease. Compliance with allocated treatment 
211 
was good; disease progression and toxicity were the principal reasons for early discontinuation. Median relative 
212 
dose intensity was 94·0% (IQR 84·2, 99·8) for carboplatin and 94·8% (IQR: 84·8, 100·0) for docetaxel.  
213 
 
214 
Overall results 
215 
There was no evidence of a difference between carboplatin and docetaxel in objective response rate in the 
216 
overall population (ORR: 59/188 (31·4%) vs. 64/188 (34·0%), absolute difference -2·6%, (95%CI: -12·1 to 
217 
6·9), p=0·66; Figure 2A). Following central review of locally classified responses, response rates were 48/188 
218 
(25·5%) carboplatin vs. 55/188 (29·3%) docetaxel, absolute difference (C-D) = -3·8 (95%CI: -12·8, 5·2); exact 
219 
p=0·49, consistent with findings from the main analysis. Similarly, no evidence of a difference was observed for 
220 
 crossover treatments (Figure S1A) or when analysis was limited to those centrally confirmed as having triple 
221 
negative tumours (see supplementary appendix).  
222 
 
223 
372 (98·9%) patients have had PFS events reported. Median PFS in patients allocated carboplatin was 3·1 
224 
months (95%CI: 2·4, 4·2) and 4·4 months (95%CI: 4·1, 5·1) for those allocated docetaxel. No difference in 
225 
restricted mean PFS was found (difference -0·30 months, p=0·40; Figure 3A).  
226 
 
227 
347 patients are reported to have died. Median OS was 12·8 months (95%CI: 10·6, 15·3) and 12·0 months 
228 
(95%CI: 10·2, 13·0) for those allocated carboplatin and docetaxel respectively. Consistent with the PFS result, 
229 
no evidence of a difference was found between treatment groups (difference -0·03 months, p=0·96; Figure 
230 
S2A). 
231 
 
232 
BRCA subgroup analyses 
233 
Protocol pre-specified subgroup analyses by BRCA1/2 mutation were conducted at the time of the main analysis. 
234 
Patients with a deleterious BRCA1/2 germline mutation had a significantly better response to carboplatin than 
235 
docetaxel (ORR: 17/25 (68·0%) vs. 6/18 (33·3%), absolute difference 34·7%, p=0·03), with no evidence of 
236 
differential treatment activity in patients with no germline mutation (ORR: 36/128 (28·1%) vs. 50/145 (34·5%), 
237 
absolute difference -6·4%, p=0·30), resulting in a statistically significant interaction (p=0·01, Figure 2B). This 
238 
result remained significant (p=0·01) after adjustment for known prognostic factors (see supplementary appendix 
239 
for details). PFS also favoured carboplatin for patients with a BRCA1/2 germline mutation (median PFS 6·8 
240 
months vs. 4·4 months, difference in restricted mean PFS 2·6 months, interaction p=0·002; Figure 3B) but no 
241 
difference was found in overall survival (Figure S2B), with interpretation confounded by the pre-planned 
242 
crossover at progression (Figure S1B). Given the small numbers of BRCA2 versus BRCA1 germline mutation 
243 
carriers randomised, comparative analyses of treatment effect for each gene and in the very small number of  ER 
244 
+ve tumours compared to those that were TNBC were neither significant nor meaningful.. 
245 
Patients with tumour available for sequencing and a BRCA1/2 mutation detected in their tumour sample (see 
246 
Table S4 for overlap of tumour detected mutation with germline BRCA1/2 mutation status) appeared to have 
247 
better response to carboplatin than docetaxel (ORR: 12/18 (66·7%) vs. 5/14 (35·7%), absolute difference 
248 
31·0%, p=0·15) whilst a treatment effect favouring docetaxel was suggested in patients with wildtype genotype 
249 
in the tumour (ORR: 23/90 (25·6%) vs. 32/90 (35·6%), absolute difference -10·0%, p=0·20). Given very small 
250 
 patient numbers with tumour mutation data neither of these subgroup analyses attained statistical significance; 
251 
however, given the effects were in opposite directions, the interaction was significant (p=0·03) (Figure 2C). 
252 
This however did not hold for PFS or OS (p=0·12, p=0·70 respectively) (Figures 3C and S2C). Eight patients 
253 
had a wildtype germline genotype but a BRCA mutation in their tumour which was therefore classed as a 
254 
somatic mutation (Table S4); 2/4 had responses with carboplatin and 2/4 with docetaxel, but small numbers 
255 
limit conclusive interpretation of these data.  
256 
 
257 
Counter to our pre-specified hypothesis, patients with BRCA1 methylation did not have better response to 
258 
carboplatin than docetaxel (ORR: 3/14 (21·4%) vs. 8/19 (42·1%), absolute difference -20·7%, p=0·28) with no 
259 
evidence of an interaction observed (p=0·35, Figures 2D, 3D, S2D); with similar conclusions when germline 
260 
BRCA1/2 mutated patients were excluded.  
261 
 
262 
Concordant with BRCA1 methylation status, tumours we defined as BRCA1 mRNA-low, with which 
263 
methylation was partially associated (Supplemntary Figure S3 and Table S5), did not have a better response to 
264 
carboplatin than docetaxel (ORR: 4/14 (28·6%) vs. 11/17 (64·7%), absolute difference -36·1%, p=0·07) and 
265 
evidence of an interaction was lacking (p=0·07, Figures 2E, 3E, S2E), again conclusions were not different 
266 
when germline BRCA mutations were excluded. Furthermore, exploratory analyses examining any relationship 
267 
between high response to carboplatin and the cut-point for BRCA1 methylation or BRCA1 mRNA1-low did not 
268 
suggest any significant signal that supported our a priori hypotheses that they would be associated with greater 
269 
response to carboplatin than a taxane (data not presented). 
270 
 
271 
Homologous Recombination Deficiency subgroup analyses 
272 
In the initial trial design and first protocol we hypothesized that changes in the genome landscape which may 
273 
arise as a consequence of defects in homologous recombination could provide an indicator of platinum salt 
274 
sensitivity and should be examined for interaction with treatment effect in both treatment arms. A number of 
275 
these assays have been reported8,22-24,27. Here we show the result using the combined Myriad HRD assay25 
276 
performed on treatment naïve primary tissue. We find that the great majority of patients with either germline 
277 
BRCA1/2 mutation or BRCA1 methylation have an high Dichotomized “HRD Score”  (Figure S4A, S4B)  but 
278 
“HRD Score”  high patients, unlike germline BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, did not have better response to 
279 
carboplatin than docetaxel (ORR: 13/34 (38.2%) vs. 19/47 (40.4%), absolute difference -2.2%, p=1.0) with no 
280 
 evidence of an interaction observed (p=0·75,  Figure 4A). Similar results were found when “HRD Deficient” 
281 
patients, a definition that grouped all BRCA1/2 mutated patients with those BRCA1/2 wild-type patients with 
282 
high HRD score, were examined (Figure 4B). In addition no evidence of treatment specific predictive effect for 
283 
PFS was found using either HRD definition (Figure S5A,B). Patients with High HRD score had a numerically 
284 
greater response to both chemotherapy agents than those with low scores but this does not appear statistically 
285 
significant. 
286 
 
287 
Basal subgroup analyses 
288 
Given association between germline BRCA1 mutation and the development of basal-like breast cancers we 
289 
sought to formally test the premise that all basal-like cancers share a BRCA1 loss of function phenotype with 
290 
those with mutation by analysing a platinum treatment interaction in this broader basal-like TNBC group. We 
291 
found no evidence that Prosigna – PAM50 basal tumours showed greater response to carboplatin compared 
292 
with docetaxel (ORR: 27/83 (32·5%) vs. 27/87 (31·0%), absolute difference 1·5%, p=0·87). However, in 
293 
patients with non-basal-like tumours response to docetaxel was significantly better than to carboplatin (ORR: 
294 
13/18 (72·2%) vs. 3/18 (16·7%), absolute difference -55·5%, p=0·002), leading to a significant interaction test 
295 
(p=0·003, Figure 5A) and a similar trend in crossover treatment response (Figure S6). The interaction between 
296 
treatment and PAM50 subgroups remained significant after adjusting for gBRCA status in the multivariable 
297 
logistic regression model (p=0·002) (Table S6) and when other known prognostic factors were subsequently 
298 
included in the model. The interaction was also significant for PFS (p=0·04) (Figure 6A) but not OS (p=0·17) 
299 
(Figure S7A). 
300 
There was no evidence that “core basal” tumours defined by IHC had improved response to carboplatin 
301 
compared with docetaxel (ORR: 23/67 (34·3%) vs. 19/65 (29·2%), absolute difference 5·1%, p=0·58). While 
302 
there was a higher response rate to docetaxel compared with carboplatin in patients with non-basal 5 marker 
303 
negative (5NP) tumours (ORR: 13/31 (41·9%) vs 5/26 (19·2%)., absolute difference -22·7%, p=0·09), the 
304 
difference did not reach statistical significance and the interaction test was non-significant p=0·06 (Figures 5B, 
305 
6B, S7B).   
306 
 
307 
Safety 
308 
Both carboplatin and docetaxel demonstrated toxicity consistent with their known safety profiles and Grade 3 
309 
and 4 adverse events (AEs) were as anticipated for these well-known chemotherapy drugs (Tables S7 and S8). 
310 
 There were more grade 3/4 AEs with docetaxel than with carboplatin. 276 Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) were 
311 
reported throughout the trial (102 carboplatin; 174 docetaxel). The spectrum of SAEs was as anticipated. Two 
312 
SAEs were considered to be Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions (1 carboplatin; 1 docetaxel). 
313 
These were i) nausea, vomiting and headaches; ii) low magnesium. One death was considered possibly related 
314 
to carboplatin treatment; this patient died from pulmonary embolism. As an haplo-insuffiency or dominant 
315 
negative effect of heterozygous mutation might affect toxicity from HR targeting therapies such as platinum in 
316 
mutation carriers we sought evidence of excess haematological toxicity as a signal but found none (Table S9). 
317 
Although there was a small numerical difference in non-haematological toxicity this was not significant and 
318 
small numbers preclude firm conclusions from these analyses.

Discussion 
321 
This phase III trial utilised two mechanistically distinct single agent chemotherapeutics in unselected advanced 
322 
TNBC and in a priori specified biomarker defined sub-populations thought likely to have targetable defects in 
323 
HR DNA repair. In the unselected TNBC patients no evidence of a superior response to carboplatin was 
324 
observed when compared with a standard of care taxane, docetaxel. Carboplatin was better tolerated than 
325 
docetaxel delivered at the full licensed dose. This trial demonstrates significant activity for both agents and the 
326 
level of response seen for docetaxel is consistent with that seen previously in breast cancer32 and for carboplatin 
327 
with that seen in uncontrolled trials of single agent platinums33,34 or combinations of carboplatin with 
328 
gemcitabine in unselected TNBC35. The only other randomised trial conducted synchronous with our trial and 
329 
designed to specifically investigate platinum in comparison with a standard of care in advanced TNBC included 
330 
the substitution of cisplatin for paclitaxel given in a doublet with gemcitabine. In this study treatment was 
331 
continued until disease progression, as is common practice with paclitaxel, and showed modestly greater activity 
332 
for cisplatin36. A criticism of our study could be that patients did not receive treatment to progression but for 6 
333 
cycles (and at investigator discretion maximum of 8 cycles), as was consistent with UK practice with docetaxel 
334 
at the full licensed 100mg/m2 dose, as this is rarely tolerated for more than 6-8 cycles. This may explain shorter 
335 
PFS compared to the study of Hu et al despite similar overall survival36, and may have underestimated the effect 
336 
of carboplatin in those without a progression event during treatment and who might have continued event free 
337 
for longer had treatment continued.  
338 
 
339 
 In contrast to the unselected population, the pre-specified analyses of treatment effect in subgroups found 
340 
evidence of clinically and statistically significant biomarker-treatment interactions. There is a strong association 
341 
between BRCA1 mutation and basal-like cancer37 and sporadic basal-like breast cancer subtypes show high 
342 
degrees of chromosomal genomic instability3. We hypothesised that if, as has been widely speculated, there was 
343 
a shared profound BRCAness phenotype sporadic basal-like cancers might have very high platinum sensitivity. 
344 
We found no evidence that basal-like biomarkers predicted higher response to platinum than docetaxel with the 
345 
drugs showing similar activity. A significant treatment interaction was detected with the Prosigna PAM50 
346 
identified subtypes; driven by significantly increased response to docetaxel relative to poor platinum response in 
347 
non-basal forms of TNBC. This suggests absence of targetable BRCAness in non-basal TNBC and no evidence 
348 
to change the standard of care from taxane to a platinum, which our data suggests is inferior in these subtypes. 
349 
In contrast platinum is a reasonable option in those with basal TNBC particularly in those who fail to tolerate or 
350 
have previously received a taxane. As the response rate is much less than that of BRCA1/2 mutation associated 
351 
breast cancer, if there is a profound BRCAness phenotype that remains prevalent in metastatic basal-like breast 
352 
cancer, beyond the context of BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation, it appears  to lie within a yet to be identified 
353 
subpopulation of this subtype.  
354 
 
355 
BRCA1/2 mutation testing is a clinically validated and widely available biomarker that predicted both greater 
356 
response and PFS in favour of carboplatin over docetaxel demonstrating clinical utility for treatment selection in 
357 
this setting. There was no evidence that mutation was associated with reduced activity of docetaxel compared to 
358 
wildtype; docetaxel remains a valid and active, but inferior, treatment option in this setting. We did not find 
359 
evidence of an overall survival advantage for carboplatin in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, but interpretation is 
360 
confounded by the crossover design as 56% received carboplatin at progression. The high levels of response 
361 
seen for carboplatin were similar to those reported for the combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel in an 
362 
essentially similar population in the reference comparator arm in the phase II BROCADE trial38, supporting the 
363 
notion that carboplatin monotherapy is highly active in this patient group. We found approximately one third of 
364 
BRCA1/2 carriers did not respond to platinum. Potential resistance mechanisms will be further explored in 
365 
integrated whole genome and whole transcriptome sequencing analyses in primary tumour material but lack of 
366 
extensive metastatic tumour from patients immediately prior to platinum treatment will limit sensitivity and 
367 
ability to draw firm conclusions. 
368 
 
369 
 In parallel we tested the hypothesis that epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 by DNA methylation would show a 
370 
similar treatment interaction. Despite similar numbers in genetic and epigenetic BRCAness subgroups, patients 
371 
with BRCA1 methylation or mRNA low had a higher response to docetaxel than carboplatin. Exploratory 
372 
analyses seeking optimisation of cut-points and analysis of these epigenetic biomarkers as continuous variables 
373 
failed to find any signal. In stark contrast to the interaction between BRCA1/2 mutation and carboplatin 
374 
treatment effect we find no evidence to support a similar impact of epigenetic BRCAness with no interaction 
375 
found between either BRCA1 methylation or BRCA1 mRNA low status and carboplatin treatment effect. This 
376 
suggests important differences in the effects of genetic and epigenetic changes at the BRCA1 locus, at least in 
377 
predicting therapy response in metastatic breast cancer exposed to prior adjuvant chemotherapy. These results 
378 
are consistent with previous results from the non-randomised TBCRC 009 trial in metastatic TNBC33 where the 
379 
few tumours with BRCA1 methylation showed no response to platinum despite evidence of chromosomal 
380 
instability signatures. The majority of our patients had received adjuvant chemotherapies that cause DNA 
381 
lesions that engage HR for repair. We measured BRCA1 methylation and mRNA in archived primary tumour 
382 
specimens, whereas treatment effect was assessed in metastases. We speculate that in mutation carriers, a higher 
383 
proportion retain an HR defect in metastatic disease than those with BRCA1 methylated tumours 
384 
(Supplementary Figure S9). We suggest mutation creates a more resilient “hard” BRCAness whereas BRCA1 
385 
methylation associated epigenetic BRCAness is more “soft” and plastic20. The methylation of BRCA1 may be 
386 
both more heterogeneous and/or more revertible in subclinical metastases that, when subjected to selection 
387 
pressure by DNA damaging adjuvant therapy, lose their HR defect and survive  subsequently developing as HR 
388 
proficient and not selectively platinum sensitive metastases. Our hypothesis is supported by data from both pre-
389 
clinical patient derived xenografts and primary breast tumours exposed to neo-adjuvant chemotherapy40. In 
390 
ovarian cancers BRCA1 mutation but not methylation is associated with improved prognosis after platinum41,42 
391 
and examination of pre- and post-platinum treatment biopsy pairs shows reversion of BRCA1 methylation in 
392 
31% with continued presence of methylation being associated with PARP inhibitor response43. While defects in 
393 
HR are known to be revertable mutational signatures would not be expected to disappear, as they are a 
394 
permanent “scar” of prior, even if no longer active, HR defects. While our finding that the Myriad HRD assay 
395 
did not have specific platinum response predictive performance in the advanced TNBC disease setting contrasts 
396 
to reported association with platinum response in the neoadjuvant setting in TNBC25 these neoadjuvant studies 
397 
do not have a comparator arm to allow a test of  interaction  between biomarker status and any specific 
398 
treatment effect of platinum chemo as opposed to association with a relatively greater general chemotherapy 
399 
 responsiveness than HRD low status . Where this was examined in the randomised neoadjuvant context the 
400 
Myriad HRD assay has not shown specific predictive performance for platinum response44. Metastatic disease , 
401 
exposed to prior adjuvant therapy is also a very different biological context. We hypothesise that adjuvant 
402 
therapy drives reversal of the BRCA1 methylation “soft’ BRCAness40 HR defect, that we show like BRCA1 
403 
mutation leaves a high HRD score in the primary tumour (Figure S4),  erodes the positive predictive value of the 
404 
HRD score for therapy response in metastasis while a low HRD Score will likely retain negative predictive 
405 
value by excluding many tumours that have never had an HR defect whether “soft” or “hard”. Since our 
406 
analysis, a novel HR deficiency mutational signature whole genome sequence analysis methodology called 
407 
“HRDetect” has been described with preliminary evidence of potential application to FFPE clinical materials8. 
408 
As HRDetect is also a cumulative historical measure of lifetime HR deficiency the positive predictive value of 
409 
this method may also be eroded by the effects of reveral of epigenetic HR defects in treatment exposed 
410 
metatstatic disease and require integration with additional biomarkers of a tumours current HR status. Analyses 
411 
of HRDetect and multiple additional mutational signatures, and their integration with transcriptional signatures 
412 
of BRCAness and treatment response8,23,25,28,29 are planned but require whole genome sequencing currently 
413 
being piloted in TNT Trial FFPE material . These future analyses are beyond the scope of this manuscript. 
414 
 
415 
Previous randomised studies have not examined treatment effect in a priori defined subpopulations within 
416 
advanced TNBC36. TNT highlights the heterogeneity in TNBC and need to investigate therapeutic effects with 
417 
planned analyses of biological subgroups. We provide the first evidence of the clinical utility of BRCA1/2 
418 
genotyping to inform therapy choice in metastatic familial breast cancer and TNBC. In early TNBC three recent 
419 
trials have tested the role of the addition of platinum to anthracycline and taxane based neoadjuvant schedules, 
420 
finding evidence of increased pathological tumour response45-47. These studies are underpowered for survival 
421 
endpoints, but where reported, significant effects on disease free survival were only seen when the alkylating 
422 
agent cyclophosphamide was omitted from the control arm backbone45. A non-significant trend was noted when 
423 
a standard cyclosphosphamide “backbone” control was used in the CALGB 40603 study46. The dose intense 
424 
carboplatin regimen used in GeparSixto was recently compared with a sequential anthracycline and taxane and 
425 
high dose cyclophosphamide-containing regimen with no differences found in the primary pathological response 
426 
measures48. It would seem that the use of alkylating agents in early TNBC is important, especially for those that 
427 
have higher stage disease with associated risk of recurrence requiring a maximally effective therapy to reduce 
428 
this risk and achieve optimal surgery. The balance of additional toxicity and paucity of appropriately powered 
429 
 survival analyses testing interaction with potential predictive biomarkers for platinum response suggest the need 
430 
for more study before platinums are used routinely across all stages and biological subtypes of early TNBC. 
431 
Data from our trial although conducted in advanced TNBC inform this landscape and raise important hypotheses 
432 
for further testing in the early breast cancer setting. 
433 
 
434 
Many countries now perform inexpensive local BRCA1/2 germline testing. Our results support such testing to 
435 
select patients for platinum chemotherapy for advanced disease. No PARP inhibitor is yet licensed in breast 
436 
cancer. The OlympiAD trial 49 recently reported comparison between the potent PARP inhibitor olaparib, 
437 
known to trap PARP1 on DNA, in comparison to physicians choice of non-platinum standard of care 
438 
chemotherapies in anthracycline and taxane exposed advanced gBRCA-BC. Other trials of potent PARP 
439 
inhibitors are ongoing50. The PARP inhibitor olaparib is now approved in advanced gBRCA-BC but this 
440 
treatment may remain unaffordable to many health care systems and patients for many years. It remains 
441 
unknown how potent PARP1-trapping inhibitors would compare with platinums in this setting but the TNT trial 
442 
provides evidence that a widely available affordable off-patent biomarker has utility to select a population, 
443 
enriched in the TNBCs prevalent in many developing countries51, who could benefit during this period from the 
444 
biologically targeted use of highly active and inexpensive platinum chemotherapy agent rather than the current 
445 
licensed breast cancer standard of care chemotherapies.
