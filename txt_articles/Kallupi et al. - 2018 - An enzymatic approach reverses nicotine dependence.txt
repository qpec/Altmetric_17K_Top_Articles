An enzymatic approach reverses nicotine dependence, 
decreases compulsive-like intake, and prevents relapse

Tobacco use disorder is the leading cause of disease and preventable death worldwide, but current medications 
that are based on pharmacodynamics have low efficacy. Novel pharmacokinetic approaches to prevent nicotine 
from reaching the brain have been tested using vaccines, but these efforts have failed because antibody affinity 
and concentration are not sufficient to completely prevent nicotine from reaching the brain. We provide preclinical 
evidence of the efficacy of an enzymatic approach to reverse nicotine dependence, reduce compulsive-like nico-
tine intake, and prevent relapse in rats with a history of nicotine dependence. Chronic administration of NicA2-J1, 
an engineered nicotine-degrading enzyme that was originally isolated from Pseudomonas putida S16, completely 
prevented nicotine from reaching the brain and reversed somatic signs of withdrawal, hyperalgesia, and irritability- 
like behavior in nicotine-dependent rats with a history of escalation of nicotine self-administration. NicA2-J1 also 
decreased compulsive-like nicotine intake, reflected by responding despite the adverse consequences of contin-
gent footshocks, and prevented nicotine- and stress (yohimbine)–induced relapse. These results demonstrate the 
efficacy of enzymatic therapy in treating nicotine addiction in advanced animal models and provide a strong foun-
dation for the development of biological therapies for smoking cessation in humans.
INTRODUCTION
Tobacco use disorder is the leading cause of disease and preventable 
death worldwide. It is responsible for over 400,000 deaths annually 
in the United States. Three of five people who try one cigarette be-
come daily smokers (1), and nearly all smokers who lapse experi-
ence the rapid escalation of smoking behavior, followed by full-blown 
relapse despite the adverse health consequences that are associated 
with smoking (2–5). Converging evidence indicates that such an es-
calation and compulsive-like pattern of smoking is mediated by 
nicotine (6–11), the main psychoactive ingredient of tobacco that is 
also responsible for the development of tobacco dependence (12, 13). 
Despite the existence of several approved medications, the rate of 
relapse in abstinent smokers remains high after 12 months (~75 to 
80%) (14). Therefore, it is critical to develop novel approaches to 
reduce the psychoactive effects of nicotine, decrease craving, and 
prevent relapse. An alternative strategy to treat tobacco use disorder 
is to reduce the psychoactive effects of nicotine by preventing nico-
tine from reaching the brain. Such an approach may allow a pro-
gressive reduction of the level of dependence, leading to a decrease 
in craving and preventing relapse that is induced by reexposure to 
nicotine. Pharmacokinetic approaches to prevent nicotine from 
reaching the brain have been tested using vaccines, but these efforts 
have failed because antibody titers are not sufficient to prevent nico-
tine from reaching the brain.
We recently reported the characterization and therapeutic po-
tential of NicA2-J1 (15), a reengineered nicotine-degrading enzyme 
that was originally isolated from Pseudomonas putida S16 (16–18). 
This enzyme blocked the access of nicotine to the brain and pre-
vented the development of nicotine dependence in a simple model 
of passive induction of nicotine dependence in rats (19). However, 
it is not yet known whether such an enzymatic approach could also 
reverse nicotine dependence in individuals that  are already depen-
dent on nicotine. In humans, nicotine withdrawal is characterized by 
somatic and affective symptoms, including irritability and hyper-
algesia (20, 21), leading to powerful craving for tobacco (20) and 
associated with smoking to relieve negative effects (22). Abstinence 
from chronic nicotine also leads to a withdrawal syndrome in rodents 
(13) that can be characterized by the emergence of somatic signs, 
irritability- 
like behavior, and hyperalgesia (7, 23, 24), leading to an 
increase in craving and the escalation of nicotine self-administration 
once access to nicotine is renewed. Even more compelling from a 
translational perspective would be to demonstrate that such an en-
zymatic approach also reduces compulsive-like responding for nico-
tine and prevents nicotine- and stress-induced relapse.
We conducted a series of studies to determine whether chronic 
NicA2-J1 administration (i) prevents nicotine from accessing the 
brain in an animal model of escalation of nicotine self-administration, 
(ii) reverses nicotine dependence, reflected by the emergence of so-
matic signs of withdrawal, irritability-like behavior, and hyperalgesia 
at different time points after acute NicA2-J1 treatment, (iii) decreases 
compulsive-like responding for nicotine, and (iv) reduces nicotine- 
and stress (yohimbine)–induced relapse in rats with a history of esca-
lation of nicotine self-administration. Moreover, we allowed rats to 
self-administer nicotine under long-access conditions with various 
protocols for ~2 weeks to test the effects of NicA-J1 on nicotine 
dependence and the escalation of nicotine self-administration with 
long access (21 hours/day) and intermittent access (every 48 hours), 
compulsive-like intake (i.e., responding in the presence of contin-
gent footshocks), and stress- and nicotine-induced reinstatement 
after the extinction of nicotine seeking. We previously showed 
that intermittent access to extended (21 hours/day) nicotine self- 
administration produced robust escalation of nicotine intake in 
rats, with high irritability-like behavior, hyperalgesia, and somatic 
signs of withdrawal (8).

RESULTS
NicA2-J1 decreases blood nicotine levels
To evaluate the effect of NicA2-J1 on blood nicotine levels, we trained 
two groups of rats (n = 8 per group) for 12 consecutive days to 
self-administer nicotine (0.03 mg/kg per injection) for 21 hours daily. 
Once a stable baseline of nicotine intake was reached, both groups 
were exposed to intermittent nicotine intake (every 48 hours) in 
four sessions. Both groups exhibited robust escalation of nicotine 
intake. From this point onward, one group of rats continued the 
escalation phase for an additional five sessions, with the only differ-
ence that NicA2-J1 (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) was administered 
60 min before each nicotine exposure. The other group was admin-
istered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; intraperitoneally) and run 
in parallel, serving as a control group. At the end of the fifth session, tail 
blood was collected for the detection of blood nicotine levels (Fig. 
1A). NicA2-J1 (2 mg/kg) did not produce a consistent decrease in 
blood nicotine levels (Fig. 1B). The rats were then given another five 
sessions of access to nicotine with a higher dose of NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg), 
and blood was collected again at the end of the fifth session. NicA2-J1 
at 10 mg/kg significantly reduced blood nicotine levels (Fig. 1C).
NicA2-J1 reverses somatic and affective signs of withdrawal 
in dependent rats
Individuals who attempt to cease smoking experience somatic and 
affective withdrawal symptoms. Some of the most prominent symptoms 
are irritability and nociception. Thus, we tested whether NicA2-J1 
reverses irritability-like behavior and hyperalgesia in withdrawn, 
nicotine-dependent rats with a history of escalation of nicotine self- 
administration. To determine whether NicA2-J1 prevents hyper-
algesia during withdrawal, we tested the effect of 5 days of treatment 
with NicA2-J1 or PBS on mechanical sensitivity thresholds at three 
time points: (i) prior to nicotine exposure to establish naive animals’ 
baseline, (ii) after completion of the self-administration phase, 48 hours 
into nicotine withdrawal (pre-escalation), and (iii) again 48 hours 
into nicotine withdrawal after chronic treatment with NicA2-J1 (post- 
escalation phase). To determine the effect of NicA2-J1 on irritability- 
like behavior, aggressive and defensive behaviors were evaluated in 
the bottle-brush test (25) after 48 hours of nicotine withdrawal fol-
lowing the escalation of nicotine intake (Fig. 2A). We found a sig-
nificant decrease in mechanical sensitivity thresholds in both groups 
during nicotine withdrawal compared with the rats’ baseline hyper-
algesia thresholds in their nicotine-naive state. After 5 days of treatment 
with NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg), NicA2-J1 completely reversed hyper-
algesia compared with the group that was treated with PBS, normal-
izing hyperalgesia thresholds to nicotine-naive baseline levels (Fig. 2B). 
The NicA2-J1 group exhibited lower defensive and aggressive re-
sponses compared with their level of irritability before treatment 
and compared with the PBS-treated group (Fig. 2C). One possible 
explanation for these results is that withdrawal in NicA2-J1–treated 
rats may have occurred before the withdrawal test was performed. 
To evaluate this possibility, we performed the same experiment as 
described above, with the only difference that after a single injection 
of NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg) or PBS (as a control), hyperalgesia was mea-
sured 3, 11, 22, 46, and 70 hours after the NicA2-J1 injection, corre-
sponding to 2, 10, and 21 hours after nicotine self-administration 
and 24 and 48 hours into spontaneous nicotine withdrawal (Fig. 3, 
Fig. 1. Blood nicotine levels after escalation of nicotine intake. (A) Detailed timeline of the experiments. (B) After the last session of escalation of nicotine intake, blood 
nicotine levels were detected in rats that were pretreated with NicA2-J1 (2 mg/kg) (red circles) and rats that were pretreated with PBS (blue circles). Student’s t test showed no 
difference in blood nicotine levels between groups (t = 1.15, df = 14, P > 0.05). (C) At the termination of escalation of nicotine intake, rats that were pretreated with NicA2-J1 
(10 mg/kg) exhibited nearly undetectable levels of nicotine in blood compared with the PBS-pretreated group (Student’s t test; t = 4.198, df = 14, P < 0.001). **P < 0.01.

A to D). No difference in pain threshold was observed before and 
after treatment with NicA2-J1 (Fig. 3D) or PBS (Fig. 3C) at the three 
time points (2, 10, and 21 hours) during nicotine self-administration, 
demonstrating that NicA2-J1 did not precipitate withdrawal. After 
24 hours of withdrawal, both NicA2-J1– and vehicle-treated rats 
exhibited a significant decrease in pain thresholds, but the animals 
that were treated with NicA2-J1 exhibited less of a decrease in pain 
thresholds and recovered after 48 hours, whereas the control animals 
continued to exhibit significant hyperalgesia.
NicA2-J1 does not affect nicotine self-administration in 
dependent rats
In both groups of rats, no difference in nicotine self-administration 
was observed after NicA2-J1 (2 mg/kg) or PBS treatment during 
escalation compared with treatment prior to escalation (Fig. 4, D 
and H). After completing this phase, blood was collected immedi-
ately after the cessation of nicotine intake to measure blood nicotine 
levels, which did not differ between groups (P > 0.05; Fig. 1B). To 
determine whether the escalation of nicotine intake in NicA2-J1– 
treated animals was dose dependent, we treated the rats with a fivefold 
higher dose of NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg) for another 5 days, in parallel 
with PBS treatment in the control group. No difference in nicotine 
intake was observed between groups, but a significant decrease in 
blood nicotine levels was observed in NicA2-J1–treated animals 
compared with the control group (P < 0.05; Fig. 1C). These results 
indicate that NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg) degraded nicotine in blood to 
levels that were too low to produce nicotine dependence but still 
sufficiently high to serve as a discriminative stimulus to maintain 
nicotine self-administration.
NicA2-J1 reduces compulsive-like responding for nicotine  
in dependent rats
We next sought to determine whether NicA2-J1 decreases compulsive- 
like responding for nicotine. Blood nicotine levels may be sufficiently 
high to serve as a discriminative stimulus but not sufficiently high 
to maintain nicotine self-administration in the face of adverse con-
sequences, which is a hallmark of tobacco use disorder. We recorded 
the number of nicotine rewards that were obtained by the rats during 
1 hour of nicotine self-administration when 30% of the nicotine re-
wards were paired with contingent footshocks (0.1 and 0.2 mA). 
The results were compared with the number of rewards that were 
obtained in the first hour of nicotine intake on the previous days 
Fig. 2. NicA2-J1 prevents nicotine addiction–like behavior during withdrawal. (A) Detailed timeline of the experiments. (B) NicA2-J1 suppressed hyperalgesia during 
nicotine withdrawal. The two-way mixed-factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA), with group (PBS versus NicA2-J1) as the between-subjects factor and time (baseline, 
pre-escalation hyperalgesia, and post-escalation hyperalgesia) as the within-subjects factor, revealed significant effects of group (F1,14 = 4.91, P = 0.04) and time (F2,14 = 
10.89, P = 0.0003) and a significant group × time interaction (F2,28 = 5.11, P = 0.012). The Newman-Keuls post hoc analysis revealed that mechanical sensitivity significant-
ly decreased during withdrawal (pre-escalation) in PBS-treated rats compared with their mechanical sensitivity before nicotine exposure (P = 0.017) and compared with 
the NicA2-J1 group (P = 0.007). Mechanical sensitivity after pretreatment with NicA2-J1 was comparable to baseline sensitivity before nicotine exposure (P > 0.05), sug-
gesting that NicA2-J1 treatment completely reversed withdrawal-induced hyperalgesia (pre-escalation versus post-escalation, P = 0.043), whereas this effect was not 
detected in the PBS group, which exhibited more severe hyperalgesia during withdrawal (post-escalation versus baseline, P = 0.0018). Moreover, the Newman-Keuls post 
hoc analysis showed that hyperalgesia during post-escalation was completely reversed in the NicA2-J1 group (post-escalation in the PBS group versus post-escalation in 
the NicA2-J1 group, P = 0.041). (C) Effect of NicA2-J1 on irritability-like behavior, reflected by defensive and aggressive responses. The baseline of defensive and aggres-
sive responses was measured during 48 hours of spontaneous nicotine withdrawal before treatment with NicA2-J1 or PBS. All the other measures were performed during 
48 hours of spontaneous nicotine withdrawal after the last escalation phase after the completion of NicA2-J1 treatment (10 mg/kg). A significant decrease in defensive 
responses (n = 8; t = 4.5, df = 7, P < 0.01) and aggressive responses (n = 8; t = 5.22, df = 7, P < 0.01) was observed in NicA2-J1–pretreated rats. No changes from baseline 
were observed in the PBS group. Student’s paired t test revealed a significant reduction of aggressive responses (t = 2.27, df = 14, P < 0.05) but not defensive responses 
(t = 1.85, df = 14, P > 0.05) in NicA2-J1–pretreated rats compared with PBS-pretreated rats. *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, versus baseline; #P < 0.05, versus pre-escalation; &P < 0.05,

(i.e., without footshocks). Nicotine-dependent animals that exhibited 
the escalation of nicotine intake and were treated with PBS continued 
to respond for nicotine despite the adverse consequences of footshocks 
(Fig. 5, A to C), whereas animals that were treated with NicA2-J1 
exhibited a significant reduction of nicotine intake when footshocks 
were introduced. These results indicate that NicA2-J1 decreased 
compulsive-like responding for nicotine, in addition to reversing symp-
toms of nicotine dependence. These results suggest that NicA2-J1 
may facilitate smoking cessation by reducing the symptoms of nico-
tine dependence and the motivation to smoke, but its effect on 
stress- and nicotine-induced relapse after protracted abstinence re-
mains to be demonstrated.
NicA2-J1 prevents stress- and nicotine-induced relapse  
in nicotine-dependent rats
Rats that previously escalated their nicotine intake underwent an 
extinction phase for 21 hours/day for 10 consecutive days. During 
this phase, the operant program was identical to the one that was 
previously used for nicotine self-administration, with the exception 
that responses at the drug lever did not result in nicotine delivery. 
After the extinction criterion was met (< 5 total responses in the 
first hour; Fig. 6B), stress- and nicotine-induced reinstatement was 
assessed using a within-subjects design. Animals with a history of 
PBS treatment exhibited robust reinstatement of nicotine seeking 
after a single intravenous injection of nicotine (0.03 mg/kg), whereas 
animals with a history of NicA2-J1 treatment did not exhibit rein-
statement (Fig. 6C). The rats were then left undisturbed in their 
home cages for 2 days, followed by three additional extinction ses-
sions to reestablish the extinction criterion (< 5 total responses in 
the first hour) before being tested in the stress-induced reinstatement 
paradigm. In this test, the day after the last extinction phase, the rats 
intraperitoneally received yohimbine (2 mg/kg) in a Latin-square 
design 1 hour before the reinstatement test. A 3-day interval, during 
which the animals were subjected to daily extinction sessions, inter-
spersed yohimbine/vehicle testing. Yohimbine significantly rein-
stated responding on the lever that was previously associated with 
nicotine delivery only in PBS-treated rats, whereas NicA2-J1 pre-
vented yohimbine-induced reinstatement (Fig. 6E). Finally, we 
found that inactive lever responses were unaffected by all of the 
treatments, demonstrating selectivity of the effects of nicotine and 
yohimbine in eliciting the reinstatement of nicotine seeking. These 
results demonstrate that a history of NicA2-J1 treatment in depen-
dent animals was sufficient to prevent stress- and nicotine-induced 
relapse after protracted abstinence.
DISCUSSION
We previously showed that the NicA2-J1 enzyme degrades nicotine 
and prevents the development of nicotine dependence in a passive 
model of nicotine dependence in rats. However, whether NicA2-J1 
has translational relevance and prevents addiction-like behaviors in 
animals with a history of compulsive-like nicotine self-administration 
remains to be demonstrated. The present study found that NicA2-J1 
decreased blood nicotine levels and had remarkable preclinical effi-
cacy in reducing addiction-like behaviors in nicotine-dependent rats. 
NicA2-J1 administration reduced blood nicotine levels, reversed so-
matic and emotional signs of nicotine withdrawal in dependent rats, 
reduced compulsive-like responding for nicotine, and prevented 
nicotine- and stress-induced relapse.
NicA2-J1 dose-dependently affected nicotine clearance in blood. 
At a low dose (2 mg/kg), blood nicotine levels did not significantly 
decrease, which may reflect a compensatory effect of repeated nicotine

administration.

intake. However, at a higher dose (10 mg/kg), NicA2-J1 degraded 
nicotine in blood to undetectable levels in all of the rats (< 5 nM), 
with the exception of one rat that still had 25% of blood nicotine 
relative to controls. Such a robust decrease in blood nicotine levels 
is remarkable and vastly superior to previous approaches that used 
immunopharmacotherapies (26). Moreover, the results were con-
sistent with our previous study that observed a > 95% decrease in 
nicotine in both blood and brain at this high dose (19). Thus, the 
decrease in nicotine levels was associated with a reversal of key be-
havioral symptoms of nicotine dependence.
Rats with intermittent (every 48 hours) and extended (21 hours/day) 
access to nicotine self-administration exhibit significant somatic signs 
of withdrawal, hyperalgesia, irritability-like behavior, the escalation 
of nicotine intake, and greater motivation for nicotine (6, 8). The 
vehicle-treated group exhibited a similar pattern of nicotine-dependent 
behavior, replicating our previous studies. Nicotine-dependent rats 
that were treated with NicA2-J1 exhibited a lack of hyperalgesia and a 
robust decrease in irritability-like behavior after 2 weeks of treatment. 
Moreover, acute NicA2-J1 treatment did not precipitate withdrawal 
during nicotine self-administration and decreased withdrawal-induced 
hyperalgesia when administered acutely. These findings suggest that 
although NicA2-J1 degraded most of the nicotine in blood, a slight 
amount of nicotine likely remained in blood that was sufficient to 
prevent withdrawal in rats while decreasing the level of dependence. 
These data further confirm and extend our previous study (19), 
demonstrating that the animals that were treated with NicA2-J1 did 
not exhibit withdrawal symptoms compared with the control group 
after 5 days of treatment.
NicA2-J1 prevented the development of nicotine dependence 
and reversed nicotine dependence by normalizing somatic and 
emotional signs of nicotine withdrawal in only 2 weeks. This is a 
critical result because irritability during abstinence is often men-
tioned by users as one of the primary reasons why they relapse. 
Even more compelling from a translational perspective, NicA2-JI 
decreased compulsive-like responding for nicotine, reflected by 
nicotine intake despite the adverse consequences of contingent 
footshocks. This suggests that treatment with the NicA2-J1 enzyme 
reduced symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and diminished the in-
centive value of nicotine, thereby decreasing the motivation to take 
nicotine when confronted with adverse consequences. NicA2-J1 did

access days compared with the last three continuous-access days (P = 0.01) in both groups. (G) Inactive lever responses did not change over time in either the PBS group

not affect nicotine self-administration when no adverse conse-
quences were presented, suggesting that the very low blood nicotine 
levels were sufficient to serve as a discriminative stimulus but not 
sufficient to have incentive value, including responding despite ad-
verse consequences. Similar observations have been made in humans 
after a ~95% reduction of nicotine content in cigarettes (27). Blood 
nicotine levels rapidly decreased, but the number of cigarettes 
smoked remained stable for months; however, the subjects reported 
lower nicotine withdrawal symptoms, a greater interest in quitting, 
and lower motivation to smoke (28, 29). Moreover, NicA2-J1 re-
duced compulsive-like nicotine seeking, which is highly relevant to 
the human condition, in which smoking is often associated with 
significant adverse social consequences (e.g., conflicts with partners) 
and health consequences (e.g., coughing, pulmonary disease, and 
cancer) that are often ignored by smokers because of the high in-
centive value of nicotine and the ability of nicotine to provide relief 
from withdrawal symptoms. The present results suggest that chronic 
NicA2-J1 treatment may help reduce withdrawal symptoms and re-
duce compulsive nicotine seeking and taking.
In humans, two of the most common causes of relapse are stress 
(social or physiological) and reexposure to nicotine (initial lapse 
leading to relapse). Rats that received NicA2-J1 did not exhibit stress- 
or nicotine-induced reinstatement of nicotine seeking after extinc-
tion or during protracted abstinence. Responding at the lever that 
was previously paired with nicotine was unaltered and similar to 
extinction levels in rats that were treated with NicA2-J1. Inactive 
lever responding was unaffected, providing strong evidence against 
nonspecific effects of NicA2-J1 and yohimbine. The 2 adrenergic 
receptor antagonist yohimbine is considered a pharmacological 
stressor because it increases hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hor-
mones (30). Yohimbine has been frequently used in preclinical 
studies to model stress-induced relapse to nicotine, cocaine, alco-
hol, and opioid intake (31–33). The activation of nicotinic acetyl-
choline receptors is also crucial for nicotine reinforcement and is 
hypothesized to mediate the transition from a single lapse to a full 
relapse in humans. In the present study, pretreatment with NicA2-J1 
significantly reduced nicotine seeking following a priming injection of 
nicotine. No effect was observed on the inactive lever, again exclud-
ing possible nonspecific effects of the enzyme and nicotine treat-
ments. These results suggest that chronic NicA2-J1 treatment reversed 
symptoms of nicotine withdrawal and reduced compulsive-like re-
sponding for nicotine and may have also facilitated the normaliza-
tion of brain stress and nicotinic systems to a naive state that is no 
longer abnormally sensitive to small stress or nicotine challenges. 
These results suggest that the level of dependence is a critical driv-
ing force that contributes to both stress- and nicotine-induced rein-
statement. This interpretation is consistent with previous work that 
showed that rats with a higher level of dependence also had higher 
vulnerability to stress- and drug-induced relapse (34–36).
In summary, the present study found that a nicotine-degrading 
enzyme can reverse nicotine dependence, decrease compulsive-like 
intake, and prevent relapse in a translational animal model of nicotine 
addiction. Moreover, as we have previously reported (19), NicA2-J1 
has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, including a relatively long 
half-life and simple route of administration. We highlight its ability 
to lower compulsive-like nicotine intake, decrease relapse, and de-
crease signs of withdrawal. Further investigations should evaluate 
its efficacy for smoking cessation therapy.
Fig. 5. NicA2-J1 reduces compulsive-like responding for nicotine in dependent rats. (A) Detailed timeline of the experiments. (B) When footshock (0.1 mA) was in-
troduced, the results showed that nicotine-dependent animals that exhibited escalation of nicotine intake and were pretreated with PBS continued responding for nico-
tine despite the adverse consequences of footshocks at a higher level compared with their intake prior to footshock exposure (n = 8; t = 3.063, df = 7, P = 0.028). No change 
in responding was observed in NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg)–pretreated rats (n = 8; t = 0.39, df = 7, P = 0.7). Student’s t test revealed a significant difference between groups (t = 
2.315, df = 14, P = 0.04). (C) When a higher footshock intensity (0.2 mA) was introduced, the results showed that nicotine-dependent animals that were pretreated with 
PBS exhibited no changes in responding for nicotine despite the adverse consequences of footshocks compared with their intake prior to footshock exposure (t = 1.88, 
df = 7, P = 0.118), whereas a significant reduction was observed in NicA2-J1–pretreated rats (t = 3.78, df = 7, P = 0.0091). Student’s t test revealed a significant difference 
between groups (t = 3.5, df = 14, P = 0.0048). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, versus baseline; #P < 0.05, ##P < 0.01, comparison between the PBS and NicA2-J1 groups.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Male Wistar rats (n = 27, Charles River Laboratories) were used, 
weighing 250 to 275 g at the beginning of the experiments. The 
animals were housed in standard cages in a room with artificial light-
ning (12-hour/ 
12-hour light/dark cycle, lights off at 8:00 a.m.) at 
constant temperature (20° to 22°C) and humidity (45° to 55°) with 
food and water available ad libitum. The rats were handled once 
daily for 5 min during the first week after arrival to the vivarium. 
The animal procedures met the guidelines of the National Insti-
tutes of Health and were approved by The Scripps Research Insti-
tute Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (protocol no. 
08-0015). All of the surgical procedures were performed under 
isoflurane anesthesia, and all necessary steps were taken to mini-
mize suffering of the animals.
Drugs
Nicotine hydrogen tartrate salt was dissolved in 0.9% sterile physio-
logical sodium chloride and prepared fresh every other day (pH 7.3). 
The dose of nicotine for self-administration was 0.03 mg/kg per 
100 l. Yohimbine HCl was dissolved in distilled water and injected 
intraperitoneally at a dose of 2 mg/kg. NicA2-J1 was synthesized as 
previously reported (19) and administered intraperitoneally at doses 
of 2 and 10 mg/kg.
Mechanical nociceptive von Frey test
Mechanical sensitivity was evaluated using von Frey filaments 
(Stoelting) that ranged from 3.63 to 125.89 g as previously reported 
(37). The choice of the standard von Frey test instead of the electronic 
von Frey test or Hargreaves test was based on the ease with which 
comparisons can be made with our previous studies (8, 38, 39). 
Fig. 6. NicA2-J1 prevents nicotine- and stress-induced reinstatement after extinguished nicotine intake. (A) Detailed timeline of the experiments. (B) Extinction 
phase. (C) Pretreatment with NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg) prevented nicotine prime-induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior. The two-way mixed-factorial ANOVA, 
with group (PBS versus NicA2-J1) as the between-subjects factor and treatment (extinction, vehicle, and 0.03 mg/kg per injection of nicotine) as the within-subjects factor, 
showed a significant effect of treatment (F2,14 = 9.14, P = 0.0008) and a significant group × treatment interaction (F2,28 = 3.48, P = 0.044). The Newman-Keuls post hoc 
analysis revealed that one injection of nicotine (0.03 mg/kg per injection) significantly increased the number of lever presses compared with the extinction phase in 
PBS-treated rats (P < 0.0008). Nicotine priming did not induce the reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior in rats that were pretreated with NicA2-J1 during escalation 
(nicotine priming versus extinction, P = 0.61). The post hoc analysis showed that nicotine-induced priming was abolished in the NicA2-J1 group compared with the PBS 
group (nicotine priming in the PBS group versus nicotine priming in the NicA2-J1 group, P = 0.047). (D) Inactive lever responses were unaffected by nicotine infusions in 
either group (F2,28 = 0.64, P = 0.53). (E) NicA2-J1 (10 mg/kg) prevented the stress (yohimbine)–induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior in the PBS-pretreated 
group. The two-way mixed-factorial ANOVA, with group (PBS versus NicA2-J1) as the between-subjects factor and treatment (extinction, vehicle, and yohimbine) as the 
within-subjects factor, showed a significant effect of treatment (F2,14 = 3.31, P = 0.05) and a significant group × treatment interaction (F2,28 = 5.12, P = 0.0127). The Newman- 
Keuls post hoc analysis revealed that yohimbine significantly increased the number of lever presses in the PBS-pretreated group compared with the extinction phase (P = 
0.011). No effect of yohimbine-induced reinstatement was observed in the NicA2-J1–pretreated group. (F) Inactive lever responses were unaffected by yohimbine in either 
group (F2,28 = 0.15, P = 0.85). *P < 0.05, **P < 0.01, versus extinction; &P < 0.05, nicotine priming–induced reinstatement between the PBS and NicA2-J1 groups.

Briefly, the series of von Frey filaments was applied from below the 
wire mesh to the central region of the plantar surface of the left and 
right hindpaws in ascending order, beginning with the lowest fila-
ment (3.63 g) after 10 min of habituation to the testing environment. 
A withdrawal response was considered valid only if the hindpaw was 
completely removed from the platform, indicating a positive re-
sponse. The stimulus was incrementally increased until a positive 
response was observed and then decreased until a negative response 
was observed. The ascending and descending testing protocol was 
used to determine the paw withdrawal threshold as previously re-
ported (39). Paw withdrawal thresholds were recorded before self- 
administration (serving as an individual baseline), before the initiation 
of escalation (pre-escalation), and after 14 days of escalation (post- 
escalation). The data are expressed as grams of applied force. In a 
separate cohort of animals, we performed the same experiment, 
with the only difference that after a single injection of NicA2-J1, 
hyperalgesia was measured after 2, 10, and 21 hours of nicotine 
self-administration and then 24 and 48 hours into withdrawal, cor-
responding to 3, 11, 22, 46, and 70 hours after NicA2-J1 treatment.
Irritability-like behavior
The bottle-brush test was used to test irritability-like behavior during 
nicotine withdrawal, based on the methods of Kimbrough et al. (25). 
This test was performed after 48 hours of nicotine withdrawal and 
measured aggressive and defensive responses. Testing consisted of 
10 trials per rat in plastic cages (26.67 cm by 48.26 cm by 20.32 cm; 
Ancare, Bellmore, NY, USA) with fresh bedding. Three observers 
who were blinded to treatment scored behavior, and the average 
scores of the three observers for each behavior were calculated: ag-
gressive responses (smelling, biting, boxing, following, and explor-
ing the target) and defensive responses (escaping, burying, jumping, 
climbing, grooming, and vocalization). The test was performed in 
the pre-escalation and post-escalation phases.
Intravenous catheter surgery
Chronic intravenous jugular catheter implantation was performed 
as previously described (40). Briefly, the rats were anesthetized with 
1 to 3% isoflurane in an oxygen mixture. Incisions were made to 
expose the right jugular vein. A catheter that was made from silicon 
tubing (inner diameter, 0.5 mm; outer diameter, 0.9 mm) was sub-
cutaneously positioned. After insertion into the vein, the proximal 
end of the catheter was anchored with surgical silk to the muscles 
under the vein. The distal end of the catheter was attached to a 
stainless steel cannula that was bent at a 90° angle. The cannula was 
inserted in a support that was made with dental cement on the back 
of the rats. For 1 week after surgery, the rats were treated daily with 
0.2 ml of the antibiotic cefazolin (262 mg/ml). For the duration of 
the experiments, the catheters were flushed daily with 0.2 to 0.3 ml 
of heparinized saline solution. Body weights were monitored 
every day, and catheter patency was confirmed approximately every 
15 days with an injection of 0.2 to 0.3 ml of Brevital sodium solution 
(10 mg/ml). Catheter patency was assumed if there was an immediate 
loss of reflexes. The self-administration experiments began 1 week 
after surgery.
Operant training and nicotine self-administration
The self-administration chambers consisted of operant condition-
ing chambers (Med Associates, St. Albans, VT, USA) that were en-
closed in sound-attenuating, ventilated environmental cubicles. Each 
chamber was equipped with two retractable levers that were located 
in the front panel and two nosepoke holes in the back panel for food 
and water delivery. A plastic tube that was connected to the catheter 
before beginning the session delivered nicotine. An infusion pump 
was activated by responses on the right (“active”) lever, and responses 
on the left (“inactive”) lever were recorded but did not result in any 
programmed consequences. Activation of the pump resulted in the 
delivery of 0.1 ml of nicotine solution (0.03 mg/kg per 0.1 ml) under 
a fixed-ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement, paired with illumi-
nation of the chamber by the cue light. The delivery of nicotine 
solution was followed by a 20-s timeout (TO) period, during which 
further lever presses did not result in any consequences. The dura-
tion of nicotine delivery was 21 hours/day. Rats had access to food 
and water in the operant chambers for the duration of the test. Nic-
otine solution was prepared fresh every other day from (−)nicotine 
hydrogen tartrate salt (Sigma-Aldrich) on the basis of the animals’ 
body weight, and the pH was adjusted to 7.3 with 1 M NaOH.
Nicotine self-administration despite adverse consequences
The day after the last extended access to nicotine self-administration, 
the animals were placed in the self-administration chamber for a 
1-hour session, and they were tested for compulsive-like behavior. 
In this experiment, the rats were allowed to self-administer nicotine 
on an FR1 schedule of reinforcement, in which 30% of the reinforced 
responses were paired with a contingent footshock (0.1 mA, 0.5 s). 
After completion of this phase, the same procedure was used the 
next day, with the only difference that the intensity of the footshock 
was increased to 0.2 mA, 0.5 s.
Reinstatement of nicotine-seeking behavior
This experiment consisted of different stages.
Self-administration: The nicotine self-administration procedure 
was performed as described previously (7). Drug self-administration 
occurred under an FR1 schedule of reinforcement, with a 20-s TO 
period after each drug infusion, for 21 hours/day. Every drug delivery 
was associated with illumination of the cue light, which lasted for 
the duration of the TO period. During the TO period, responses were 
recorded but did not lead to drug delivery. Self-administration ses-
sions (21 hours/day, 7 days/week) were performed in operant cham-
bers that were equipped with two levers and two nosepoke holes. 
Responses on one of the levers (active lever) resulted in drug delivery, 
whereas responses on the other lever (inactive lever, a measure of 
nonspecific activity) were recorded but not reinforced. Food and 
water delivery occurred after each nosepoke.
Escalation: The escalation phase was identical to the self-administration 
phase, with the exception that the rats were introduced to the operant 
chambers every 48 hours (Monday, Thursday, Sunday, Wednesday, 
and so on).
Extinction: This phase was similar to the self-administration pro-
cedure, with the exception that presses on the active lever resulted 
in saline instead of nicotine infusions.
Prime-induced reinstatement: After the extinction criterion of 
nicotine-taking behavior was reached, the effects of priming injec-
tions of nicotine (0.03 mg/kg per injection; one infusion of nicotine 
solution at the same concentration as the one that was used during 
self-administration) or saline on the reinstatement of drug seeking 
were determined in separate daily 1-hour sessions. The rats were 
tested after intravenous drug priming injections. During the tests 
for reinstatement, lever presses resulted in saline infusions. Priming

injections were administered immediately before the test sessions 
began. The experiment was performed using a Latin-square design. 
The extinction sessions were continued between priming sessions.
Yohimbine-induced reinstatement: After completion of the 
test of prime-induced reinstatement, the rats were left undisturbed 
in their home cages for 2 days. They then underwent the extinc-
tion phase again for three consecutive days. Once the extinction 
criterion was met, the rats received an intraperitoneal injection of 
yohimbine (2 mg/kg) 1 hour before the reinstatement test. Re-
sponses on the active and inactive levers were recorded. During 
the test, lever presses resulted in saline infusions for the duration 
of the session. Data were recorded using a computer that controlled 
the operant chambers. For the reinstatement experiments, only 
responses during the first hour of extinction and reinstatement 
were analyzed.
Blood sample preparation
Blood was collected and immediately mixed with four volumes of 
methanol (with 1 M nicotine D3 as an internal standard) to quench 
the enzyme. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min, 
and the supernatant was transferred to clean tubes and evaporated 
in a rotatory evaporator Genevac. The residual was redissolved in 5% 
NH4OH in water and extracted by an Oasis HLB 96-well Elution 
Plate (Waters). The elution was evaporated in a rotatory evaporator 
Genevac and redissolved in Hepes buffer and 2% trifluoroacetic acid 
for liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS).
LC-MS for nicotine detection
Nicotine concentrations were determined by LC-MS using the 
Agilent 1260 Infinity liquid chromatography system with 6130 
quadrupole MS. Aliquots (20 l) of each sample were injected 
into a Poroshell 120 EC-C8 column (4.6 mm by 50 mm, 2.7 m; 
Agilent Technologies) and subjected to a gradient (A to B, where 
A = 0.1% formic acid in water and B = 0.1% formic acid in aceto-
nitrile) of 0% B for 3 min, 0% B to 100% B from 3 to 7 min, and 
100% B from 7 to 10 min at a constant flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. A 
column-solvent equilibration time of 3 min was implemented be-
fore the next sample was analyzed. The following were the MS 
operational parameters: API-ES (atmospheric pressure ionization 
electrospray) mode, channel 1 (90%) positive single ion monitor-
ing of mass/charge ratios 166 (50%, nicotine D3) and 163 (50%, 
nicotine) and channel 2 (10%) scan for positive ions, nitrogen as a 
nebulizing and drying gas (35 psi, 12 L/min), high capillary volt-
age of 4 kV, and drying gas temperature to 300°C. To protect the 
detector from salts in the buffer, MS was turned on with a delay of 
1.4 min after the injection.
Statistical analysis
The effects of NicA2-J1 on blood nicotine levels, irritability-like be-
havior, and compulsive-like responding were analyzed using un-
paired two-tailed Student’s t test. The effect of NicA2-J1 or PBS on 
hyperalgesia at different time points was analyzed using one-sample 
t test. The effects of NicA2-J1 on hyperalgesia and yohimbine- and 
nicotine-induced priming were analyzed using two-way mixed- 
factorial ANOVA. The effect of NicA2-J1 on nicotine intake during 
escalation was analyzed using one-way ANOVA. Significant effects 
in the ANOVA were followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple- 
comparison post hoc test. Values of P < 0.05 were considered statis-
tically significant.
