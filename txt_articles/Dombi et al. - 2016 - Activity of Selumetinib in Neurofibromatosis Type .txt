Abstract
BACKGROUND—Effective medical therapies are lacking for the treatment of neurofibromatosis 
type 1– related plexiform neurofibromas, which are characterized by elevated RAS–mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling.
METHODS—We conducted a phase 1 trial of selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886), an oral 
selective inhibitor of MAPK kinase (MEK) 1 and 2, in children who had neurofibromatosis type 1 
and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas to determine the maximum tolerated dose and to evaluate 
plasma pharmacokinetics. Selumetinib was administered twice daily at a dose of 20 to 30 mg per 
square meter of body-surface area on a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). We also 
tested selumetinib using a mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1–related neurofibroma. 
Response to treatment (i.e., an increase or decrease from baseline in the volume of plexiform 
neurofibromas) was monitored by using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analysis to 
measure the change in size of the plexiform neurofibroma.
RESULTS—A total of 24 children (median age, 10.9 years; range, 3.0 to 18.5) with a median 
tumor volume of 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744) received selumetinib. Patients were able to receive 
selumetinib on a long-term basis; the median number of cycles was 30 (range, 6 to 56). The

 maximum tolerated dose was 25 mg per square meter (approximately 60% of the recommended 
adult dose). The most common toxic effects associated with selumetinib included acneiform rash, 
gastrointestinal effects, and asymptomatic creatine kinase elevation. The results of 
pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this trial were similar to those 
published for adults. Treatment with selumetinib resulted in confirmed partial responses (tumor 
volume decreases from baseline of ≥20%) in 17 of the 24 children (71%) and decreases from 
baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%). Disease progression (tumor volume 
increase from baseline of ≥20%) has not been observed to date. Anecdotal evidence of decreases 
in tumor-related pain, disfigurement, and functional impairment was observed.
CONCLUSIONS—Our early-phase data suggested that children with neurofibromatosis type 1 
and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas benefited from long-term dose-adjusted treatment with 
selumetinib without having excess toxic effects. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and 
others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01362803.)
Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a common genetic disorder that is characterized by multiple 
manifestations including tumors of the nervous system.1,2 Plexiform neurofibromas develop 
in 20 to 50% of persons with neurofibromatosis type 1 and can cause substantial 
complications including pain, functional impairment, disfigurement, and malignant 
transformation.3–7 Most plexiform neurofibromas are diagnosed in early childhood and grow 
most rapidly during this period.8,9 Complete surgical resection of these tumors is often not 
feasible, and regrowth of the tumor after incomplete surgical resection has been 
observed.10,11
The NF1 product neurofibromin functions as a negative regulator of RAS activity. Lack of 
functional neurofibromin in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 leads to dysregulated 
RAS and tumorigenesis.12–14 The availability of agents that target RAS signaling and other 
pathways implied in the pathogenesis of plexiform neurofibromas15,16 has led to phase 2 
clinical trials of tipifarnib,17 pirfenidone,18 sirolimus,19,20 pegylated interferon alfa-2b,21 
and imatinib,22 in which the primary objectives were to increase the rate of progression-free 
survival or to decrease plexiform neurofibroma volumes. In these trials, tumor volume 
decreases from baseline of at least 20% were identified in only 4 of 83 patients (5%) who 
participated in the pegylated interferon alfa-2b trial21 and in only 5 of 36 patients (14%) who 
participated in the imatinib trial.22
The development of genetically engineered mouse models of neurofibromatosis type 1–
related tumors has allowed for the conduct of preclinical trials of targeted agents.23–26 In a 
mouse model of neurofibromatosis type 1–deficient acute myeloid leukemia, mitogen-
activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase (MEK) inhibition induced objective tumor 
regression.26 In the DhhCre;Nf1fl/fl model of neurofibromatosis type 1– related 
neurofibromas, the specific MEK inhibitor PD0325901 resulted in tumor shrinkage in the 
majority of mice, which supported the evaluation of specific MEK inhibitors in patients with 
neurofibromatosis type 1–related neurofibromas.27
Selumetinib (AZD6244 or ARRY-142886) is an oral selective inhibitor of MEK 1 and 2 that 
has shown activity against several advanced adult cancers.28–30 We report here the results of

 a phase 1 trial of selumetinib, as well as preclinical data on the activity of selumetinib in the 
animal model of neurofibroma.
Methods
Trial Oversight
This trial was developed by investigators at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in 
collaboration with the NCI Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), was sponsored by 
CTEP, and was coordinated by the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch. Four institutions (the 
NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch, Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Cincinnati Children’s 
Hospital, and Children’s National Health System) participated in patient recruitment and 
data collection. Data analysis was performed by NCI investigators. AstraZeneca provided 
selumetinib for the trial, approved the trial protocol (available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org), and provided financial support for the analysis of selumetinib in plasma 
samples. AstraZeneca did not have a role in patient recruitment, data analysis, or manuscript 
preparation but participated in the review and approval of the manuscript for submission. 
The protocol was approved by the institutional review board at each participating site. All 
patients or their legal guardians provided written informed consent. The authors vouch for 
the accuracy and completeness of the data reported and for the fidelity of the trial to the 
protocol.
Patients
Children 3 to 18 years of age who had received a clinical diagnosis of neurofibromatosis 
type 131 and who had inoperable, measurable plexiform neurofibromas32 that had the 
potential to cause substantial complications were eligible for participation in the trial. A 
complete list of the inclusion and exclusion criteria is provided in Table S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org.
Trial Design
Selumetinib (10-mg and 25-mg capsules) was administered approximately every 12 hours on 
a continuous dosing schedule (in 28-day cycles). The dose of selumetinib was calculated on 
the basis of body-surface area with the use of a dosing nomogram. The starting dose was 20 
mg per square meter of body-surface area (approximately 50% of the recommended fixed 
dose of 75 mg for adults), with potential dose escalations to 50 mg per square meter. A 
standard 3 + 3 phase 1 dose escalation design33 was followed (details are provided in the 
Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Patient assessments included clinical examinations, laboratory evaluations, ophthalmologic 
examinations, echocardiography, and electrocardiography at baseline and at regular intervals 
during the trial (Table S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Adherence to the dosing 
schedule was assessed by administration of the Responsibility for Medication 
Questionnaire,34 by review of a patient diary, and by capsule counts. Evaluations of response 
to treatment were performed centrally at the NCI by review of magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) studies obtained after cycles 5 and 10 and thereafter after every 6 cycles.32,35 The use 
of standard response criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors [RECIST] and

 World Health Organization [WHO] criteria)36,37 to evaluate the responses of plexiform 
neurofibromas to treatment has limited applicability because of the complex shapes and slow 
growth rates of plexiform neurofibromas. Therefore, a more sensitive and reproducible 
volumetric MRI analysis, which has been established as the definitive assessment method, 
was used in this trial.8,15,32,35 Patients who had documented disease progression at trial 
entry (i.e., a tumor volume increase of ≥20% within approximately 1.5 years before 
enrollment) could continue treatment with no limitation of duration if there were no 
unacceptable toxic effects of the treatment and if no further progression was documented. 
Patients who did not have documented disease progression at trial entry could continue 
treatment for a maximum of 2 years unless a partial response was observed, in which case 
treatment could continue beyond 2 years.
Adverse events were graded according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. An algorithm was developed for the assessment and 
management of cardiac toxic effects of selumetinib. The maximum tolerated dose was 
defined as the highest dose level at which one third of the patients or fewer had dose-limiting 
toxic effects during cycles 1 to 3. With specific exceptions, a dose-limiting toxic effect was 
defined as any selumetinib-related toxic effect of grade 3 or higher or a persistent (≥7 days) 
selumetinib-related toxic effect of grade 2 that the patient considered to be unacceptable. 
Administration of selumetinib was interrupted if a dose-limiting toxic effect occurred. If the 
toxic effect resolved to within protocol-defined trial specifications, treatment could resume 
at a dose that was 30% lower than the patient’s previous dose. Treatment with selumetinib 
was permanently discontinued if the toxic effect did not resolve to meet protocol 
specifications within the required time frame. A second reduction in dose according to the 
same criteria was allowed (details of the trial design are provided in the Supplementary 
Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Pharmacokinetic Evaluations
The pharmacokinetics of selumetinib in plasma were evaluated during cycle 1 among 
patients for whom consent was provided. Blood samples were obtained as follows: on day 1 
before the first dose was administered and 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 to 12, 24, and 30 to 36 hours 
after administration of that dose; in addition, a blood sample was obtained on day 27 before 
the first dose was administered. Concentrations of selumetinib and its active metabolite, N-
desmethyl selumetinib, were analyzed by Covance Bioanalytical Services.38 
Pharmacokinetic variables were calculated by means of noncompartmental methods.39
Response Criteria
A partial response was defined as a tumor volume decrease from baseline of at least 20% for 
at least 4 weeks. Disease progression was defined as a tumor volume increase from baseline 
of at least 20%. Stable disease was defined as a tumor volume change from baseline of less 
than 20%.
Preclinical Trial of Selumetinib
Selumetinib was evaluated in the DhhCre;Nf1fl/fl genetically engineered mouse model of 
neurofibroma with the use of an intermittent dosing schedule. Mice received selumetinib

 twice daily at a dose of 10 mg per kilogram through oral gavage on a 5-days-on, 2-days-off 
schedule over a period of 8 weeks. Volumetric MRI analysis of neurofibromas was 
performed at the NCI to assess response to selumetinib (further details are provided in the 
Supplementary Methods section in the Supplementary Appendix).
Results
Patient Characteristics
From September 21, 2011, to February 27, 2014, 24 patients (11 girls and 13 boys; median 
age, 10.9 years [range, 3.0 to 18.5]) were enrolled in this ongoing trial. Data that were 
available as of January 4, 2016, are included in this article. Table 1 provides a summary of 
demographic, clinical, and baseline disease characteristics, and details are listed for each 
patient in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix. The median volume of the target 
plexiform neurofibromas at baseline was 1205 ml (range, 29 to 8744). A total of 19 patients 
had received one to six previous medical therapies for the neurofibromas, and 11 patients 
had undergone one to six previous surgeries to debulk the neurofibromas. Of 17 patients for 
whom previous volumetric data were available, 9 had progressive disease at enrollment. A 
retrospective chart review identified neurofibroma-related complications that were present at 
baseline, including disfigurement (18 patients), pain (13 patients), and impairment of motor 
function (9 patients).
Dose Escalations, Toxic Effects, and Duration of Treatment
The 24 patients received selumetinib at three dose levels: 12 patients at 20 mg per square 
meter of body surface area (the 20-mg group), 6 patients at 25 mg per square meter (the 25-
mg group), and 6 patients at 30 mg per square meter (the 30-mg group) (Table 2, and Tables 
S3 and S4 in the Supplementary Appendix). During cycles 1 through 3, the mean percentage 
of patients who were considered to have adhered to the dosing schedule was 99% (range, 91 
to 100) on the basis of patient diaries and 98% (range, 96 to 100) on the basis of capsule 
counts. Dose-limiting toxic effects that were counted toward the determination of the 
maximum tolerated dose were grade 3 cellulitis (1 patient), grade 3 urticaria (1 patient), and 
grade 3 creatine kinase elevation (1 patient), all of which occurred during cycles 1 through 
3; in addition, grade 3 asymptomatic decreased left ventricular ejection fraction, which 
occurred during cycle 5 (1 patient), was included as a dose-limiting toxic effect because of 
the potential clinical significance of this event and the fact that the first echocardiogram that 
is performed during treatment occurs after 5 cycles.
Thirty milligrams of selumetinib per square meter exceeded the maximum tolerated dose, 
and 20 mg per square meter was defined initially as the maximum tolerated dose. However, 
on the basis of a trial of selumetinib for low-grade gliomas that was being conducted 
concurrently by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, in which the maximum tolerated 
dose was determined to be 25 mg per square meter,40 we amended our trial to evaluate this 
additional dose level with the intention of harmonizing pediatric dosing. In our trial, a grade 
3 dose-limiting maculopapular rash developed in only 1 of 6 patients in the 25-mg group 
(Patient 24). Thus, 25 mg per square meter was considered to have an acceptable side-effect 
profile and was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose. Dose-limiting toxic effects in

 later cycles were creatine kinase elevation (4 patients), oral mucositis (3 patients), and 
cellulitis (1 patient).
Throughout all treatment cycles, doses were reduced as a result of dose-limiting toxic effects 
in 4 of 12 patients in the 20-mg group, in 4 of 6 patients in the 30-mg group, and in 3 of 6 
patients in the 25-mg group. All dose-limiting toxic effects were reversible. Most 
selumetinib-related adverse events were mild (grade 1). The most common adverse events of 
any grade included creatine kinase elevation, which was asymptomatic in all but 1 patient in 
whom transient arm pain developed; gastrointestinal toxic effects; acneiform rash in 
postpubertal patients; and maculopapular rash in prepubertal patients. Creatine kinase was 
fractionated in 17 patients and was found to be of skeletal muscle (CK-MM) origin rather 
than cardiac (CK-MB) origin. Early treatment of acneiform rash with topical clindamycin or 
glucocorticoids and oral tetracycline (5 patients) allowed for the successful management of 
rash. Toxic effects that were most common in later cycles included mucositis, 
aminotransferase elevation, decreased neutrophil count, and paronychia (Table S4 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Serial ophthalmologic examinations revealed no abnormalities, with the exception of a grade 
1 asymptomatic cataract at cycle 16 in 1 patient. This patient had previously received 
imatinib and retinoic acid for treatment of his neurofibromas; he continues to receive 
selumetinib and has stable ophthalmologic findings. A reversible, asymptomatic decrease in 
the left ventricular ejection fraction of greater than 10 percentage points to less than the 
lower limit of the normal range (from 65% to 50%) was observed in 1 patient at the 
evaluation visit after cycle 5 (Patient 7). Selumetinib dosing was suspended and 
administration of lisinopril was initiated. The left ventricular ejection fraction recovered to 
55% within 3 months. Selumetinib was restarted at a reduced dose; the left ventricular 
ejection fraction has remained normal and the patient continues to receive selumetinib (cycle 
30). No measurable effect of selumetinib on height or weight was observed during treatment 
(see the Supplementary Results section in the Supplementary Appendix).
The 24 patients received a median of 30 cycles of selumetinib (range, 6 to 56). A total of 19 
patients continue to receive treatment after a median of 30 cycles (range, 23 to 56). 
Treatment with selumetinib was discontinued in 5 patients; treatment was stopped because 
of dose-limiting toxic effects in only 1 of these patients (details are provided in Table S3 in 
the Supplementary Appendix).
Pharmacokinetics
The mean plasma concentration–time profiles of selumetinib and the results of 
pharmacokinetic studies in the 18 patients for whom consent was provided showed limited 
variability (Fig. 1, and the Supplementary Results section and Table S5 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Selumetinib was absorbed rapidly. Selumetinib drug exposures 
increased with increasing dose but were less than dose-proportional (Fig. S1 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Selumetinib concentrations exceeded those of the N-desmethyl 
metabolite at all time points (Table S6 in the Supplementary Appendix).

 Preclinical Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics
Pharmacokinetic results in the mouse were similar to those in humans. Mouse tumor 
samples showed a transient decrease in phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 
(ERK) (Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). Selumetinib was associated with decreases 
from baseline in neurofibroma volume in 12 of 18 mice (67%) in the animal model of 
neurofibromatosis type 1– related neurofibroma; in contrast, neurofibroma volume increase 
from baseline was observed in 14 of the 15 vehicle-treated control animals (Fig. S3 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Response Evaluation
A decrease from baseline in plexiform neurofibroma volume was observed in all patients 
(median change, −31%; range, −5.8 to −47). The maximum response to selumetinib was 
reached after a median of 20 cycles (range, 5 to 42) (Table 2 and Fig. 2). A total of 17 of the 
24 patients (71%) met the criteria for confirmed partial response, including 9 of 12 patients 
in the 20-mg group, 5 of 6 patients in the 25-mg group, and 3 of 6 patients in the 30-mg 
group; an example of the response in 1 of the patients with confirmed partial response is 
shown in Figure 3A and 3B. Partial responses to selumetinib were observed in 5 of 9 
patients (56%) who had documented progressive disease at enrollment, in 4 of 6 patients 
(67%) who had growing tumors at enrollment but did not meet the criteria for progressive 
disease as defined in the protocol, in 2 of 2 patients who had tumors that were assessed as 
stable at enrollment, and in 6 of 7 patients (86%) who did not have previous volumetric data 
available at enrollment (Table 2, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Partial responses were durable, in that they were sustained for a median of 23 cycles (range, 
6 to 42), and 15 of the 17 patients with partial response maintain their response status to 
date. No patients have had disease progression to date, and the 9 patients with confirmed 
tumor growth before enrollment are free of progression after a median of 26 cycles (range, 
23 to 46). Slow regrowth of tumors has been observed in some cases, most notably after 
dose reductions or interruptions of selumetinib dosing as a result of toxic effects (Fig. 2B 
and 2C and Fig. 3A and 3C). Anecdotal evidence of clinical improvement included 
decreases in tumor-related pain, increases in motor function, and decreases in disfigurement 
(Table 2 and Fig. 3B, and Table S7 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this phase 1 trial involving children with inoperable plexiform neurofibroma, selumetinib 
had acceptable rates of dose-limiting toxic effects when administered on a long-term basis 
and was associated with a sustained reduction in tumor volumes in the majority of patients. 
The maximum tolerated dose of 25 mg per square meter every 12 hours (approximately 60% 
of the recommended fixed dose of 75 mg for adults38) is identical to the maximum tolerated 
dose in the selumetinib trial that was conducted by the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium.40 
Skin and gastrointestinal toxic effects were the most common events — a side-effect profile 
similar to that of selumetinib in adults.38,41,42 A previously unreported effect, elevation of 
the creatine kinase level, was observed in most patients in our trial and was largely 
asymptomatic. Few patients had potentially chronic or cumulative toxic effects such as oral

 mucositis or paronychia. No ophthalmologic toxic effects of concern were observed, and a 
reversible decrease in left ventricular function that required a dose reduction of selumetinib 
occurred in only one patient. In addition, no effect on height or weight was observed. The 
results of the pharmacokinetic evaluations of selumetinib among the children in this trial 
(Table S5 in the Supplementary Appendix) were similar to those in adults.38
Of the 24 patients in the trial, 17 (71%) had confirmed partial responses, and all the patients 
had some decrease in tumor volume (Table 2 and Fig. 2A, and Fig. S3 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). In previous phase 2 trials of treatment for progressive plexiform neurofibromas, 
in which tumor volume was evaluated with the use of centralized volumetric analysis at the 
NCI (Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix), tumor volume decreases of at least 20% 
were observed in few patients who received pegylated interferon alfa-2b.17–19,21 In a phase 2 
trial of imatinib, in which volumetric analysis was performed at the University of Indiana, 
volume decreases of at least 20% were limited to small tumors of less than 20 ml, which 
were substantially smaller than the majority of tumors evaluated in our trial.22
To date, tumor responses have been maintained in 15 of 17 patients, and no patient has had 
disease progression. Patients who had documented progressive disease at enrollment 
received 23 to 46 cycles of selumetinib (median, 26 cycles). These results compare favorably 
with the median time-to-progression values that were reported in previous phase 2 trials 
involving patients with progressive neurofibromas, which ranged from 13.2 to 29.4 months 
(Table S8 in the Supplementary Appendix). MEK inhibitors also showed the greatest activity 
among the targeted agents that have been tested in the neurofibroma animal model,27 which 
supports the predictive value of this model in selecting agents for clinical evaluation in 
patients with plexiform neurofibroma.
Slow tumor regrowth after the maximum response had been reached has been observed in 
several patients, most of whom had required at least one dose reduction as a result of toxic 
effects (Fig. 2B and 2C, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). This finding 
suggests a dose-dependent effect of MEK inhibition on neurofibroma growth. The clinical 
course of Patient 7 (Fig. 3B), who had disease that was responsive to treatment with 
selumetinib but who subsequently had tumor growth during a period of drug interruption 
due to toxic effects, highlights the fact that prolonged administration of selumetinib will be 
necessary among patients with progressive tumors. Although similar responses to 
selumetinib were observed at the 20-mg and the 25-mg dose levels, we selected 25 mg per 
square meter as the recommended phase 2 dose.
It is of interest that in the mouse model, intermittent dosing was efficacious, even though 
target inhibition of MEK in tumor tissue was modest and transient. Thus, even limited 
inhibition of MEK may be sufficient to shrink tumors that have no mutations beyond the loss 
of NF1 itself.43 In the future, evaluation of intermittent dosing in patients may be considered 
as a way to minimize toxic effects while retaining efficacy. In an ongoing phase 2 trial of 
selumetinib involving adults with neurofibromatosis type 1–related plexiform neurofibromas 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02407405), we are performing serial tumor biopsies to 
assess the relationship between inhibition of phosphorylated extracellular-signal-regulated 
kinase (pERK) and tumor response.

 A limitation of our trial is that the potential clinical benefit of decreases in plexiform 
neurofibroma volume was not assessed prospectively. However, the anecdotal decreases in 
pain, decreases in the degree of disfigurement, and increases in motor function among 
patients in our trial suggest that even small decreases in tumor volumes may result in clinical 
benefit. The absence of emergence of drug resistance is also of interest. Further trials are 
warranted to characterize tumors that no longer respond to selumetinib; however, such cases 
have not yet been observed.

 Figure 1. Mean Plasma Concentration–Time Profiles of Selumetinib and Median 
Pharmacokinetic Results for Selumetinib for the Three Dose Levels Evaluated
The pharmacokinetics of selumetinib in plasma were evaluated during cycle 1. Blood 
samples were obtained as follows: on day 1 before the first dose was administered and 0.5, 
1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 10 to 12, 24, and 30 to 36 hours after administration of that dose; in addition, a 
blood sample was obtained on day 27 before the first dose was administered (data not 
shown). The mean plasma concentration–time profiles of selumetinib and the 
pharmacokinetic results for the 18 patients for whom consent was provided showed limited 
variability. Selumetinib was rapidly absorbed. I bars indicate standard deviations. AUC0–inf

 Figure 2. Best Response to Selumetinib According to Dose Level and According to Dose 
Reduction Status
Panel A shows the best response to selumetinib as assessed by the percent change from 
baseline in plexiform neurofibroma tumor volume, according to dose level. Panels B and C 
show the change in plexiform neurofibroma volumes before (when available) and after 
initiation of treatment with selumetinib among patients who did not have dose reductions 
(Panel B) and among those who had dose reductions (Panel C) during the trial. Separate 
graphs are presented for the three dose levels (20, 25, and 30 mg per square meter of 
bodysurface area). The time periods during which a patient had no dose reductions are

 depicted with solid lines, and periods during which a patient had a dose reduction are 
depicted with dashed lines. Patient 5 had a plexiform neurofibroma with a large nodular 
component that did not respond to treatment with selumetinib. Patient 7, who remains in the 
trial, had a prolonged interruption in selumetinib dosing as a result of a toxic effect. Patients 
9 and 10, who also remain in the trial, are the only patients who did not have a dose 
reduction of selumetinib but had a slow increase in plexiform neurofibroma volume after 
maximal response had been observed. For Patients 3 and 20 (who remain in the trial) and 
Patients 8 and 6 (who permanently discontinued trial treatment), an increase in plexiform 
neurofibroma volume was observed after at least one selumetinib dose reduction as a result 
of a toxic effect (details are provided in Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix). PT 
denotes patient number.

 Figure 3. Examples of Response to Selumetinib
Panels A and B show data from Patient 20 (25-mg group). In Panel A, results from the 
volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis of plexiform neurofibroma growth 
show the tumor volume before treatment (gray symbols), tumor shrinkage during treatment 
with selumetinib (black symbols), and the increase in plexiform neurofibroma volume after 
dose reduction (blue open symbol). In Panel B, the visible reduction in plexiform 
neurofibroma burden is depicted in the MRI results and photographs before treatment as 
compared with those at the end of cycles 5 and 10 during treatment. Panel C shows an 
example of the need for prolonged administration of selumetinib to elicit a sustained 
response. Patient 7 (30-mg group) had progressive plexiform neurofibroma growth during 
six treatment regimens directed at his plexiform neurofibroma before treatment with 
selumetinib (gray symbols). He had a partial response at the evaluation visit after cycle 5 
(black symbols), but selumetinib was stopped because of a decrease in the left ventricular 
ejection fraction (LVEF) (broken line). When selumetinib was restarted at a reduced dose 
after recovery of the LVEF, the plexiform neurofibroma volume had increased by 44% from 
the best response value and by 9.6% from baseline. Subsequent disease evaluations (blue
