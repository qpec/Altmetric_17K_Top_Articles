Abstract
Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC)
respond to numerous hormonal and neural signals, resulting in changes in food intake.
Here, we demonstrate that ARC POMC neurons express capsaicin-sensitive transient
receptor potential vanilloid 1 receptor (TRPV1)-like receptors. To show expression of
TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we use single-cell reverse transcription-poly-
merase chain reaction (RT-PCR), immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, TRPV1 knock-
out (KO), and TRPV1-Cre knock-in mice. A small elevation of temperature in the physiologi-
cal range is enough to depolarize ARC POMC neurons. This depolarization is blocked by
the TRPV1 receptor antagonist and by Trpv1 gene knockdown. Capsaicin-induced activa-
tion reduces food intake that is abolished by a melanocortin receptor antagonist. To selec-
tively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons in the ARC, we
generate an adeno-associated virus serotype 5 (AAV5) carrying a Cre-dependent channelr-
hodopsin-2 (ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression cassette under
the control of the two neuronal POMC enhancers (nPEs). Optogenetic stimulation of
TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons decreases food intake. Hypothalamic tem-
perature is rapidly elevated and reaches to approximately 39 ˚C during treadmill running.
This elevation is associated with a reduction in food intake. Knockdown of the Trpv1 gene
exclusively in ARC POMC neurons blocks the feeding inhibition produced by increased
hypothalamic temperature. Taken together, our findings identify a melanocortinergic circuit
that links acute elevations in hypothalamic temperature with acute reductions in food intake.

Intense exercise acutely decreases appetite and subsequent food intake. As exercise is
accompanied by increased body temperature, we hypothesized that a rise in body temper-

 major components of the neural circuits that control feeding in response to hormones
and neural signals. Among hypothalamic neurons, those that express proopiomelanocor-
tin (POMC) in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus are important in controlling food
intake. In this study, we found that these POMC-expressing neurons express TRPV1-like
thermoreceptors that are activated by an increase in temperature within the physiological
range in mice. We also showed that an increase in body temperature during exercise is
directly sensed by these POMC-expressing neurons through activation of the TRPV1-like
receptors. Hence, this study provides a novel perspective on the cellular mechanisms
underlying energy balance: body temperature reduces food intake via TRPV1-like recep-
tors in POMC-expressing neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus.
Introduction
Body temperature changes according to the circadian rhythm, physical activities, and external
factors such as food intake [1–3]. Although it is expected that a rise in body temperature is rap-
idly conveyed to the hypothalamus via the blood stream, the physiological consequences of
such an increase in hypothalamic temperature have not been studied. The transient receptor
potential vanilloid subfamily members 1–4 (TRPV1, 2, 3, and 4) in peripheral sensory neurons
play a role in accurately sensing ambient temperature and in adapting to environmental tem-
perature changes through behavioral and physiological responses [4–9]. In the early 1960s,
Nakayama and colleagues showed that local hypothalamic heating from 36.7 ˚C to 38.7 ˚C
increases hypothalamic neuronal activity [10], suggesting that, like peripheral sensory neurons,
hypothalamic neurons are able to respond to changes in temperature, possibly via activation of
temperature-sensitive transient receptor potential vanilloid (TRPV) channels. Indeed, neuro-
physiological, genetic, and in situ hybridization studies have described expression of TRPV
receptors, in particular TRPV1 channels, specifically in hypothalamic neurons [11–14].
However, the presence of functional TRPV1 in the hypothalamus is still controversial. In
fact, TRPV1 reporter mouse studies have shown very limited expression of TRPV1 receptors
in the hypothalamus [12]. Second, TRPV1-expressing vasopressin neurons show temperature-
sensitive inward currents at temperatures above 35 ˚C [13,15,16], which is in contrast to the
prior findings that recombinant TRPV1 receptors are activated only by noxious temperatures
(>42 ˚C) [4]. Third, transcriptome analysis of agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and proopiome-
lanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC) shows no
expression of Trpv1 transcripts [17]. Interestingly, some ARC POMC neurons are situated out-
side the blood–brain barrier [18,19], which permits them to detect acute changes in tempera-
ture. Therefore, we sought to determine whether ARC POMC neurons express temperature-
sensitive TRPV1 receptors.
Using multiple independent techniques, we found that ARC POMC neurons expressed
capsaicin- and temperature-sensitive TRPV1 subunit-containing receptors (TRPV1-like).
Pharmacologic and optogenetic activation of ARC POMC neurons that express TRPV1-like
channels reduced food intake. Increased body temperature during exercise was transmitted to
the ARC. This elevation was associated with a reduction in food intake that was blocked by a
melanocortin receptor antagonist. These results support the interpretation that activation of
capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons contributes to the regulation
of acute food intake.

 Results
ARC POMC neurons express capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors
The ARC expresses Trpv1 mRNA and [3H]resiniferatoxin(RTX) binding sites [11,14]. Among
the class of TRPV channels, only TRPV1 channels respond to capsaicin [4,20–23]. Conse-
quently, we examined whether ARC POMC neurons respond to the selective TRPV1 receptor
agonist capsaicin [24–26]. Membrane potentials were recorded from ARC POMC–enhanced
green fluorescent protein (eGFP) neurons in hypothalamic slices from POMC-eGFP mice in
the presence of synaptic blockers (6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione [CNQX], 10 μM, and
picrotoxin, 100 μM). Treatment with capsaicin (100 nM) significantly depolarized and trig-
gered action potentials in ARC POMC neurons (S1A and S1B Fig). In addition, treatment
with another potent and selective TRPV1 receptor agonist RTX [27] (100 nM) also depolarized
ARC POMC, but not neuropeptide Y (NPY) neurons (S1C, S1D, S5B and S5C Figs). Capsai-
cin-induced depolarization was completely blocked by treatment with the TRPV1 receptor
antagonist AMG9810 (10 μM) [28] (S1E and S1F Fig). In addition, the TRPV1 receptor-
induced depolarization was still present in the presence of tetrodotoxin (TTX) (S1G and S1H
Fig). These pharmacological results support the existence of functional capsaicin-sensitive
TRPV1 channels expressed by ARC POMC neurons.
We next performed single-cell reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
and immunohistochemistry to identify the expression of capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 receptors
in ARC POMC neurons. Single-cell RT-PCR analysis of ARC POMC neurons revealed that
approximately two thirds of ARC POMC neurons examined contained Trpv1 messenger RNA
(mRNA) (Fig 1A, n = 21 out of 34 neurons). In addition to the expression of Trpv1 transcripts,
some ARC POMC neurons expressed Trpv3 and Trpv4 mRNA (S2 Fig). The prior transcrip-
tome study in which GFP-tagged POMC neurons were isolated at room temperature (24 ˚C)
showed the lack of Trpv1 mRNA in ARC POMC neurons [17]. We further investigated Trpv1
mRNA expression in ARC POMC neurons from hypothalamic slices kept at room tempera-
ture. We found that this low temperature treatment strongly down-regulated Trpv1 mRNA
levels, although the number of ARC POMC neurons expressing glutamate decarboxylase 2
(Gad2) mRNA was similar to that observed at 36 ˚C (S3 Fig). Thus, methodological differences
in the temperatures at which the tissue was isolated may account for prior failures to identify
Trpv1 transcripts in ARC POMC neurons.
Immunostaining of ARC POMC neurons with an anti-TRPV1 receptor antibody showed
TRPV1 receptor-positive cells in the ARC of control animals (Fig 1B and S4A Fig). However,
no labeled cells were observed in TRPV1 knock-out (KO) mice (Fig 1B). Additionally, western
blot analysis showed a TRPV1-positive signal in lysates from the ARC of control but not
TRPV1 KO mice (Fig 1C). Importantly, immunostaining, quantitative polymerase chain reac-
tion (qPCR), and western blot analysis showed no expression of TRPV1 receptors around the
ARC (S4B, S4C and S4D Fig). All these results provide the specificity of the anti-TRPV1 anti-
bodies that we used in this study.
Double immunolabeling experiments with an anti-POMC antibody revealed that most
TRPV1 receptor-positive cells in the ARC were POMC-containing neurons (Fig 1D,
96.3 ± 0.3%; n = 3 mice), consistent with our neurophysiological results. In contrast, very few
neuropeptide Y-expressing neurons in the ARC expressed TRPV1 receptors (S5A Fig;
1.6 ± 0.7% of TRPV1-postive neurons; n = 3 mice). To further examine the expression of
TRPV1 receptors in ARC POMC neurons, we used the TRPV1-Cre knock-in animal model
[12]. An adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) encoding Cre-inducible GFP (AAV1-
DIO-GFP) was injected into the ARC of TRPV1-Cre mice. Two weeks post viral injections, we
immunostained hypothalamic sections with anti-GFP and anti-POMC antibodies. We found

 that the ARC contained GFP-expressing cells in the ARC, confirming the expressing of
TRPV1-positive cells in this area. Importantly, GFP-positive cells also expressed POMC (Fig
1E). These results from the application of molecular, genetic, and immunohistochemical
approaches strongly support the interpretation that a population of ARC POMC neurons
expresses capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 receptors and provide our rationale for subsequent inves-
tigation of the roles of TRPV1 receptors in ARC POMC neurons in the regulation of feeding
in mice.
ARC POMC neurons express functional temperature-sensitive TRPV1-like
receptors
Increased temperature activates capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1 receptors [4]. We examined the
neurophysiological impact of temperature on TRPV1-expressing POMC neuronal activity.
Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from ARC POMC neurons in the pres-
ence of synaptic blockers (CNQX, 10 μM, and picrotoxin, 100 μM) and TTX (0.5 μM). Rais-
ing bath temperature from 34 ˚C up to 38 ˚C elicited an inward current in ARC POMC
neurons (S6A and S6B Fig). In addition, these thermal stimuli significantly depolarized ARC
POMC neurons in current-clamp configurations in the presence of synaptic blockers (Fig 1F
and 1G and S6C Fig). Approximately 40% of POMC neurons did not respond to increased
temperature (S6D and S6E Fig). This depolarization was blocked by the TRPV1 receptor
antagonist AMG9810 and by Trpv1 gene knockdown with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in
the ARC (Fig 1F, 1G and 1H). In contrast, NPY neurons did not respond to increased tem-
perature (S5D and S5E Fig). It has been demonstrated that recombinant TRPV1 receptors
responded only to noxious temperatures (>42 ˚C) [4]. Interestingly, TRPV receptors could
coassemble into heteromeric channels, and heteromeric TRPV1 receptors with other TRPV
subunits had altered temperature sensitivity [23,29]. For instance, TRPV1/TRPV3 channels
had a lower threshold temperature, around 34 ˚C [23]. Importantly, the sensitivity to capsai-
cin of heteromeric TRPV channels was determined by the presence of TRPV1 subunits [23].
As ARC POMC neurons had Trpv3 and Trpv4 mRNA along with Trpv1 mRNA, we exam-
ined whether knockdown of the Trpv3 and Trpv4 genes in the ARC affect thermal sensitivity.
POMC neurons in mice injected with Trpv3 and Trpv4 shRNA were less sensitive to
increased temperature (S7A and S7B Fig). Therefore, our results suggest that ARC POMC
neurons express TRPV1 receptor subunit-containing heteromeric TRPV channels (hence,
we describe them as “TRPV1-like”).

 Capsaicin-induced depolarization reduces food intake
Given that ARC POMC neurons play a role in the control of food intake [30–34], we asked
whether activation of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons is sufficient to reduce
food intake. To test this possibility, animals were fasted for 6 h (from 1 PM to 7 PM) before
drug infusion and capsaicin was directly infused into the ARC. Local microinjection of capsai-
cin (100 nM) significantly reduced food intake (Fig 2A, 2B and 2C). This anorexigenic effect
was blocked by local injection of AMG9810 (Fig 2D). Genetic silencing of the Trpv1 gene by
injecting Trpv1 shRNA into the ARC also abolished the effect of capsaicin (Fig 2E, 2F, 2G, 2H
and S1 Table). Therefore, activation of capsaicin-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors in the ARC
decreases food intake.
We then examined whether capsaicin-induced depolarization of ARC POMC neurons
reduces food intake. We expressed inhibitory designer receptors exclusively activated by
designer drugs (DREADDs) in ARC POMC neurons by injection of a Cre-dependent
AAV5-Gi/o-DREADD- monomeric cherry fluorescent protein (mCherry) into the ARC of the
POMC-Cre animals (Fig 3A). Two weeks after such virus injections, there was expression of
mCherry-positive cells in the ARC (Fig 3B). More than 90% of mCherry positive cells con-
tained POMC (Fig 3B). Treatment with clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (10 μM) inhibited the activ-
ity of mCherry-positive POMC neurons and blocked the effect of RTX in hypothalamic slice
preparations (Fig 3B). In in vivo studies of these animals, intraperitoneal administration of
CNO alone did not change food intake as described in prior studies [35]. However, CNO-
induced inhibition of ARC POMC neurons was sufficient to block the effect of capsaicin on
food intake (Fig 3C and 3D and S1 Table), suggesting that inhibition of ARC POMC neurons
counteracts capsaicin-induced excitation of ARC POMC neurons.
ARC POMC neurons synthesize and release POMC-derived peptides such as anorexigenic
α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH) [36,37] and depolarization of ARC POMC neu-
rons releases α-MSH, resulting in reduced food intake [36]. We examined whether the anorex-
igenic effect of capsaicin is due to the release of α-MSH. We intracerebroventricularly injected
the melanocortin 3/4 receptor antagonist SHU9119 prior to local injection of capsaicin. While
injection of SHU9119 had no feeding effect when administered alone (Fig 3E), pretreatment
with SHU9119 abolished the anorexigenic effect of capsaicin (Fig 3E and S1 Table). In con-
trast, capsaicin was still effective in reducing feeding in the presence of the antagonist for the
opioid receptor naloxone (1 mM; S8 Fig). Our results support the interpretation that activation
of TRPV1-like receptor induces the release of anorexigenic α-MSH from ARC POMC neurons
and consequently reduces food intake.
Activation of TRPV1-like receptors expressed in POMC neurons reduces
feeding
Next, we investigated whether activation of TRPV1-like receptors expressed exclusively in
ARC POMC neurons regulates feeding. To this end, we used the Cre-dependent clustered reg-
ularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas-9)
system to silence the Trpv1 gene in ARC POMC neurons. We crossed POMC-Cre with floxed-
stop CRISPR/Cas-9-eGFP mice to generate POMC-Cre;;CRISPR/Cas-9-eGFP mice (Fig 4A).
We injected Trpv1 single guide RNA (sgRNA) into the ARC of these mice and then examined
whether ARC POMC neurons still respond to capsaicin. Immunohistochemical experiments
with an anti-c-fos protein antibody revealed that local injection of capsaicin induced c-fos pro-
tein expression in ARC POMC neurons in control mice, whereas mice injected with Trpv1
sgRNA to ARC POMC neurons showed no c-fos protein expression in response to capsaicin
(Fig 4B, 4C and 4D). Moreover, the mean amplitude of temperature-sensitive currents in

 POMC neurons from mice injected with Trpv1 sgRNA was significantly smaller than that
observed in Controls (S6A and S6B Fig).
Given that the anorexigenic effect of capsaicin was abolished by the melanocortin 3 and 4
receptor (MC3/4R) antagonist, we expected that administration of capsaicin would not reduce
food intake in mice silencing the Trpv1 gene in ARC POMC neurons. Indeed, capsaicin had
no effect on feeding in this animal model, whereas POMC-Cre mice injected with Trpv1
sgRNA still showed a reduction in food intake following capsaicin treatment (Fig 4E and 4F).
Our results appeared to be inconsistent with prior studies showing that stimulation of the
whole population of ARC POMC neurons failed to decrease food intake [35,36,38]. We thus
investigated whether activating TRPV1-like receptor-expressing ARC POMC neurons
decreases food intake. To selectively stimulate TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neu-
rons in the ARC, we generated an AAV5 carrying a Cre-dependent channelrhodopsin-2
(ChR2)–enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (eYFP) expression cassette under the control of
the two neuronal POMC enhancers (nPE1 and nPE2) (AAV5-nPE-DIO-ChR2-YFP, Fig 5A).
These enhancers have been shown to drive reporter gene expression to ARC POMC neurons
[39]. We injected this viral vector into the ARC of TRPV1-Cre mice with an expectation that
only TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons, among the entire ARC POMC neuro-
nal population, would express ChR2. Eight weeks post viral injections, we found expression of
the reporter protein in POMC neurons in the ARC (Fig 5B). Importantly, optogenetic stimula-
tion of these neurons at 10 Hz for 1 h significantly reduced food intake (Fig 5C and 5D). Our
results support the interpretation that, contrary to the prior findings [35,36,38], selective stim-
ulation of a specific subset of ARC POMC neurons (i.e., TRPV1-like receptor-expressing) is
sufficient to decrease food intake.
A rise in body temperature elevates ARC temperature
A small elevation in temperature within the physiological range (from 37 ˚C to 38 ˚C) acti-
vated TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons in hypothalamic slices. We asked whether
ARC temperature undergoes such elevations under normal physiological conditions. It has
been shown that physical exercise raises not only body but also brain temperature [40]. Thus,
we measured both ARC and body temperature during a 40-min bout of treadmill running in
trained mice (Fig 6A and 6B and S1 Movie). This exercise rapidly raised body as well as ARC
temperature (Fig 6B and 6C). ARC temperature reached a plateau after 20 min exercise and
remained high for more than 1 h.
We sought to determine if this rise in ARC temperature is associated with reduced feeding
through activation of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons. Mice were given liquid
food following the completion of the exercise bout to measure acute changes in food intake
(Fig 6D). We found that exercised mice consumed significantly less food than did non-exer-
cised mice (Fig 6D). Importantly, the anorexigenic effect of exercise was abolished by adminis-
tration of the MC3/4R antagonist SHU9119 (Fig 6E and S2 Table), suggesting that exercise-

possibility, we measured food intake in mice silencing the Trpv1 gene in ARC POMC neurons
after exercise. We found that, although mice injected with control sgRNA showed a decrease
in food intake (Fig 6F), exercise had no effect on food intake in mice silencing the Trpv1 gene
in ARC POMC neurons (Fig 6G and S2 Table). Hence, our results propose that elevated hypo-
thalamic temperature can activate temperature-sensitive TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC
neurons, which may result in a reduction in food intake.
Discussion
All the results from neurophysiologic, molecular, genetic, and immunohistochemical studies
provided evidence that ARC POMC neurons expressed functional TRPV1 channels. ARC
POMC neurons were sensitive to capsaicin but activated by physiological warm temperature
around 37 ˚C, suggesting that ARC POMC neurons may express heteromeric rather than
homomeric TRPV1 receptors. In fact, a subset of ARC POMC neurons had Trpv3 and Trpv4
transcripts. Pharmacological and optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-like receptor-expressing
ARC POMC neurons reduced food intake. This anorexigenic effect was blocked by an MC3/
4R antagonist. Importantly, a transient increase in body temperature was rapidly transmitted
to the ARC. This elevation of hypothalamic temperature was enough to reduce food intake,
although temperature-independent effects might explain these anorexigenic effects. Mice
silencing the Trpv1 gene exclusively in ARC POMC neurons showed no effect of increased
hypothalamic temperature on food intake. Therefore, our results support the interpretation
that ARC POMC neurons have the ability to respond not only to hormones and nutrients but
also to changes in body temperature.
At first glance, our present TRPV1 receptor expression results may appear to be inconsis-
tent with those from a prior study describing the lack of Trpv1 mRNA expression in
ARC POMC neurons [17]. We think this is likely due to methodological differences in the
temperatures applied during transcriptome assessments. In the study of cell type–specific tran-
scriptomics, POMC-GFP cells were sorted at room temperature [17]. Importantly, such sub-
physiological temperatures reducedTrpv1 mRNA expression [41]. Thus, transcriptomic
expression of TRPV1 receptors would be expected to be greatly down-regulated under such
low temperature conditions; indeed, in our hands we found that low temperature treatment
(i.e., 24 ˚C) strongly decreased Trpv1 mRNA expression in ARC POMC neurons. We did find
robust Trpv1 mRNA in ARC POMC neurons, but only when we incubated at a temperature in
the physiological range.
The use of multiple independent techniques, including patch-clamp recording, single-cell
RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry, western blotting, gene knockdown with shRNA, CRISPR/
Cas-9-mediated gene knockdown, TRPV1 KOs, and TRPV1-Cre mice, provided converging
lines of evidence for the expression of TRPV1 receptor subunits in ARC POMC neurons.
However, it appears that there was a discrepancy between our results and the prior findings

 described in the literature [24,25]. In particular, ARC POMC neurons were depolarized by
warm temperature (>37 ˚C). It is unlikely that this depolarization was mediated via activation
of homomeric TRPV1 receptors. In fact, recombinant TRPV1 receptors were activated at
much higher temperatures (>42 ˚C) [4,23]. These findings suggest that warm temperature-
elicited depolarization may be due to the activation of other than TRPV1 channels, such as
TRPV3 and TRPV4 subunits, with a low threshold temperature [5,6,25,42,43]. Although we
cannot rule out this possibility, the sensitivity to capsaicin suggests that ARC POMC neurons
contained TRPV1 subunits that have a specific binding site for capsaicin [20–22].
It has been documented that TRPV channels can assemble into heteromeric complexes
[23,29,44]. Heteromeric TRPV channels containing TRPV1 subunits are always sensitive to
capsaicin, but have altered threshold temperature [23,44]. For instance, heteromeric TRPV1/
TRPV3 channels are activated at lower temperatures compared to homomeric TRPV1 chan-
nels in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (HEK293) cells (>34 ˚C versus >38 ˚C) [23],
suggesting that ARC POMC neurons may express heteromeric TRPV channels. In our prepa-
rations, Trpv3 and Trpv4 mRNA were also detected along with Trpv1 transcripts in ARC
POMC neurons. Interestingly, the neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nucleus
expressing TRPV1 and TRPV4 receptor subunits were excited by warm temperature
[13,16,45]. The neurons in these areas in TRPV1 KO mice still responded to elevated tempera-
ture, although the amplitude of temperature-elicited currents was greatly reduced [13,16]. In
line with these findings, we found that knockdown of the Trpv3 and Trpv4 genes in the ARC
altered the thermal sensitivity. Hence, it seems likely that TRPV receptors in the hypothalamus
generally form heteromeric rather than homomeric complexes that have capsaicin-sensitive
TRPV1 subunits (TRPV1-like).
Despite the well-known anorexigenic effects of α-MSH [46], stimulation of the entire ARC
POMC population did not produce the canonical reduction in food intake [35,36,38]. The lack
of effects of selective stimulation of ARC POMC neurons would be due in part to POMC neu-
ron heterogeneity. A large and growing body of literature supports the idea that ARC POMC
neurons are neurochemically, anatomically, and functionally heterogeneous [19,31,47–51].
For example, activation of ARC POMC neurons by the cannabinoid receptor type 1 agonist
has been shown to promote food intake through the release of opioids [31]. In our prepara-
tions, optogenetic stimulation of TRPV1-expressing POMC neurons clearly reduced food
intake. These findings suggest that neurochemically and/or neuroanatomically distinct sub-
populations of ARC POMC neurons play distinct roles in feeding behavior. In fact, while both
TRPV1 and cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1) agonists depolarize POMC neurons [31], the
physiological consequences of ARC POMC neuron activation by TRPV1 versus CB1 agonists
diverged in opposite directions. Hence, it is plausible that the net balance between anorexi-
genic melanocortin POMC and orexigenic opioid POMC neurons would be finely tuned by
differential responses to nutrient-related molecules and signaling, as described in our prior
study [19]. Interestingly, long- but not short-term stimulation of ARC POMC neurons effec-
tively decreased food intake and this anorexigenic effect was completely absent in Ay mice
[36], suggesting that long-term stimulation of the entire population of ARC POMC neurons
could indeed shift the net balance toward the anorexigenic melanocortin outflow.

 Administration of capsaicin reduced food intake and prevented body weight gain in
rodents and humans [52,53]. TRPV1 KO mice gained more body weight than did control ani-
mals in adulthood and when fed a high-fat diet [54]. Our present findings provided possible
explanations as to how vanilloids contribute to the regulation of feeding behavior. In other
words, capsaicin and its analog excite TRPV1-like receptor-expressing POMC neurons, result-
ing in lowered food intake. Importantly, TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons were
activated not only by vanilloids but also by small, physiological elevations in temperature that
can also easily be induced by a brief bout of treadmill exercise. Hence, TRPV1-like receptor-
expressing POMC neurons could function as a transducer of thermal stimuli. Like hormones
and nutrients, temperature-induced depolarization of ARC POMC neurons drove anorexi-
genic, melanocortinergic neuronal outflow in our preparations. In the early 1960s, feeding-
related activity has been shown to result in an “immediate” increase in brain temperature
(within less than 1 min) [55], suggesting that diet, like physical exercise, is able to increase
hypothalamic temperature. As capsaicin increases satiety and fullness in humans as well [56],
it is plausible that elevated hypothalamic temperature could promote satiety and thereby
reduce food intake through activation of TRPV1-like receptors in ARC POMC neurons.
In summary, we identify a melanocortinergic circuit beginning in ARC POMC neurons
that links acute elevations in peripheral and brain temperature with acute reductions in food
intake via activation of TRPV1-like receptors. Such temperature-sensing mechanisms are ide-
ally situated to mediate the regulation of energy intake and expenditure.

 All neurophysiological recordings were obtained from bright fluorescent green neurons
present in POMC-eGFP mice, except as noted, such as POMC-eGFP neurons in POMC-Cre;;
CRISPR/Cas9 mice. The internal solution contained the following (in mM): 130 K-gluconate,
5 CaCl2, 10 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 MgATP, 0.5 Na2GTP, and 10 phosphocreatine. Membrane
potentials were recorded in the presence of ionotropic glutamate and GABAA receptor antago-
nists such as CNQX and picrotoxin (10 μM and 100 μM, respectively) with a Multiclamp
700B. Membrane currents were recorded in the presence of TTX (500 nM) and synaptic block-
ers. Electrophysiological signals were low-pass filtered at 2–5 kHz, stored on a PC, and ana-
lyzed offline with pClamp 10 software (Molecular devices). For each recording, the membrane
potentials measured from every 30 s were taken as 1 data point. A total of 10 data points before
and after the application of drugs were compared using the unpaired t test.
Stereotaxic surgery, drug infusion, and measurement of food intake
Mice were maintained under isoflurane anesthesia and placed in a stereotaxic apparatus.
Under aseptic conditions, sterile custom guide cannulas were stereotaxically implanted into
the ARC (AP, −1.2 mm; ML, 0; DV, −5.5 mm) for local injection of drugs (1 μL of 100 nM cap-
saicin, Sigma-Aldrich, cat # M2028 and AMG9810, Tocris bioscience, cat # 2316) and into the
lateral ventricle (AP, +0.85 mm; ML, +0.5 mm; DV, −3.0 mm) for injection of SHU9119
(Tocris bioscience, cat # 3420) or naloxone (Tocris bioscience, cat # 0599). Animals were
allowed at least a week to recover from surgery. To measure food intake, animals were
separated individually in single cages for 5 d and fasted for 6 h (from 1 PM to 7 PM) before
drug infusion. SHU9119 (1 μL of 5 μM) or naloxone (1 μL of 1 mM) was intracerebroventricu-
larly administrated 30 min prior to microinjection of capsaicin or saline. Capsaicin and/or
AMG9810 were directly infused into the ARC at 6 PM. Food intake was measured from 7 PM
to 11 PM and from 11 PM to 7 AM. The mice used for all of the experiments were randomly
assigned to a treatment group. For animal studies, sample sizes were estimated according to
our previous experience [19]. Single housed mice with a 20% weight loss were excluded from
experiments and analyses. For optogenetic experiments, a mono fiber-optic cannula of 230 μm
diameter (Doric Lenses, Inc.) was implanted into the ARC and coupled to a 473-nm DPSS
laser (Laserglow Technologies).
Measurement of body and ARC temperatures, and treadmill exercise
To directly measure both body and hypothalamic temperatures, while mice were running on a
treadmill, a wire thermoprobe (IT-24P, Physitemp Instruments) was placed into the ARC (AP,
−1.2 mm; ML, 0; DV, −5.5 mm) through a guide cannula and another wire thermoprobe
(RET-4, Physitemp Instruments) was inserted into the rectum.
For treadmill exercise (Eco-6M, Columbus Instruments), mice were trained to run on the
treadmill for 2 wk. The mice were always warmed up for 5 min at 7 m/min and the speed was
slowly ramped up to 18 m/min. To measure food intake following exercise, animals were
fasted from 1 PM to 7 PM and given liquid food (Ensure original nutrition shake, Abbott). If

Immunofluorescence staining
Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and transcardially perfused with preperfusion solution
(9 g NaCl, 5 g sodium nitrate, 1,000 u heparin in 1 L distilled water). Brains were incubated in
4% paraformaldehyde overnight at cold room and sectioned with a vibratome in 50 μm on the
following day. For immunofluorescence staining, sections were incubated in 10 mM sodium
citrate solution (pH 9.0) for 30 min at 80 ˚C in a water bath. Following the antigen retrieval,
the sections were blocked in 0.1 M PBS buffer containing 0.1% triton X-100, 5% normal goat
serum or normal donkey serum, and 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 h at room temperature
and then incubated with anti-TRPV1 (1:1,000, Alomone Labs, cat # ACC-030), anti-c-fos

Trpv1 gene) encoding Trpv1. Arrows show mRNA regions detected by primer sets (outer,
blue; inner, red). Gel images show lack of Trpv1 mRNA in ARC POMC neurons from slices
kept at 24 ˚C. M: PCR marker (Trpv1, 248 bp; Gad2, 205 bp; 18S rRNA, 121 bp). P: positive
control single-cell samples were collected from hypothalamic slices kept at 24 ˚C and 36 ˚C for
3 h. The initial RT reaction was conducted after pressure ejection of the single-cell samples
into freshly prepared RT mix A solution (20 U of RNase OUT, 300 ng of random primers,
0.5% NP-40, and RNase free water). Samples were sonicated in a total volume of 10 μL at 4 ˚C
for 5 min and then incubated for 3 min at 65 ˚C before addition of 10 μL RT mix B (500 μM
dNTP, 1 × RT buffer, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM DTT, and 200 U of Superscript IIl). The tubes were
incubated at 25 ˚C for 5 min, at 42 ˚C for 1 h, and at 65 ˚C for 10 min. Three rounds of amplifi-
cation were done for the detection of Trpv1 transcripts (two rounds with the outer primer set
and one round with the inner primer set) and two rounds of amplification for the analysis of
Gad2 transcripts. The primers used for qPCR were the following: Trpv1 outer primer, f50-
catgctcattgctctcatgg-30 and r50- aaccagggcaaagttcttcc-30, Trpv1 inner primer, f50-catgggcga-
