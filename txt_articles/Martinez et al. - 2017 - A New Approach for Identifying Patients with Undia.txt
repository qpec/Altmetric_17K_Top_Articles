Abstract
Rationale: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often
unrecognized and untreated.
Objectives: To develop a method for identifying undiagnosed COPD
requiring treatment with currently available therapies (FEV1 ,60%
predicted and/or exacerbation risk).
Methods: We conducted a multisite, cross-sectional, case-control
study in U.S. pulmonary and primary care clinics that recruited
subjects from primary care settings. Cases were patients with COPD
and at least one exacerbation in the past year or FEV1 less than 60% of
predictedwithoutexacerbationinthepastyear.Controlsubjectswere
persons with no COPD or with mild COPD (FEV1 >60% predicted,
no exacerbation in the past year). In random forests analyses, we
identified the smallest set of questions plus peak expiratory flow
(PEF) with optimal sensitivity (SN) and specificity (SP).
Measurements and Main Results: PEF and spirometry were
recorded in 186 cases and 160 control subjects. The mean (SD) age of
the sample population was 62.7 (10.1) years; 55% were female; 86%
were white; and 16% had never smoked. The mean FEV1 percent
predicted for cases was 42.5% (14.2%); for control subjects, it was
82.5% (15.7%). A five-item questionnaire, CAPTURE (COPD
Assessment in Primary Care to Identify Undiagnosed Respiratory
Disease and Exacerbation Risk), was used to assess exposure,
breathing problems, tiring easily, and acute respiratory illnesses.
CAPTURE exhibited an SN of 95.7% and an SP of 44.4% for
differentiating cases fromall control subjects, and an SNof 95.7% and
an SP of 67.8% for differentiating cases from no-COPD control
subjects.The PEF(males, ,350 L/min;females, ,250 L/min)SN and
SP were 88.0% and 77.5%, respectively, for differentiating cases
from all control subjects, and they were 88.0% and 90.8%,
respectively, for distinguishing cases from no-COPD control
subjects. The CAPTURE plus PEF exhibited improved SN and SP
forallcasesversusallcontrolsubjects(89.7%and78.1%,respectively)
and for all cases versus no-COPD control subjects (89.7% and 93.1%,
respectively).
Conclusions: CAPTURE with PEF can identify patients with
COPD who would benefit from currently available therapy and
require further diagnostic evaluation.

 Evidence suggests that chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) is underdiagnosed
in primary care settings, with most cases being
identified during an exacerbation or after
significant loss of lung function (1).
Undiagnosed patients have been suggested to
have impaired health status (2) and outcomes
(3, 4). Therapies are available to improve lung
function, reduce exacerbations, and improve
health status in patients with COPD, with
evidence of therapeutic benefit clearly
demonstrated and strongly recommended by
the American College of Physicians, the
American College of Chest Physicians, the
American Thoracic Society, and the European
Respiratory Society in symptomatic people
with FEV1 less than 60% of predicted or who
are at risk for acute exacerbations (5, 6).
The efficient identification of this group of
unrecognized patients with COPD, whom
we arbitrarily label as having “clinically
significant COPD,” is therefore important
clinically.
To date, spirometry has served as the
“gold standard” for COPD diagnosis (7),
but, as recently noted in the U.S. Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF) report, it is
not recommended for routine, general
population, or practice-based screening in
asymptomatic patients (8). Questionnaires
offer a practical triage or case-finding
method for identifying symptomatic people
in practice settings who may have
unrecognized COPD and would benefit
from treatment. The USPSTF noted that
few data exist to support the widespread use
of case-finding approaches and that
improved clinical outcomes and the
limitations of overdiagnosis have not been
established (8). Existing questionnaires were
generally designed to identify people with
COPD without reference to disease severity
or exacerbation risk, resulting in the
identification of a high proportion of
patients with mild disease (9–17). To date,
no methodology has been designed explicitly
for the identification of people with
undiagnosed COPD who are most likely to
benefit from currently available therapies
(18). Several studies have tested the accuracy
of handheld flow meters (FEV1, FEV6, peak
expiratory flow [PEF]) for case
identification, with varying sensitivity and
specificity being reported (17). Although
informative in terms of airflow obstruction,
flow meters are unable to identify patients
at risk of exacerbation, nor can they
identify symptomatic patients.
To overcome these weaknesses, one
investigative group suggested that a
three-stage approach (risk factor
questionnaire, PEF, and spirometry) for
identifying moderate to severe COPD
(FEV1 ,60% predicted) might improve
sensitivity and specificity (19).
Although identification of patients with
mild COPD is important for research into
COPD natural history and disease prevention
(6, 8, 20), identification of patients with
symptomatic disease, with more severe
airflow obstruction (20), or at risk for
exacerbation has immediate clinical
importance for individual patients (5, 6, 21).
An NHLBI task force reviewed the available
literature and suggested that the
identification of these patients may prove to
be an ideal initial stage in systematically
evaluating the potential impact of COPD
case finding in primary care (22). We
hypothesized that use of a combination of a
questionnaire and PEF would optimally
identify patients who would benefit from
further diagnostic evaluation, such as those
with an FEV1 less than 60% predicted
and/or at risk of an exacerbation in primary
care settings (17, 18). This paper describes
the empirical methods used to develop a
new COPD case-finding methodology prior
to testing its performance properties in a
large, prospective study in primary care
settings across the United States.
Methods
Design
We conducted a prospective, cross-
sectional, multisite, case-control study
(clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT01880177)
to select the best, smallest set of questions
capable of differentiating cases and control
subjects, with and without PEF. COPD
was defined by medical diagnosis with
prescribed pharmacological maintenance
therapy and an FEV1/FVC ratio less than
0.70. To address our primary goal, cases
included subjects with COPD and a
history of at least one exacerbation in the
prior 12 months (group 1) or COPD with
moderate to severe airflow obstruction
(FEV1 ,60% predicted) and being
exacerbation-free longer than 12 months
(group 2). Control subjects included those
with no known diagnosis or treatment for
COPD (group 3) and those with mild
COPD (FEV1 .60% predicted and no
exacerbation in the prior 12 mo) (group 4).
The mild COPD group was included in
the control group to focus the item
selection process on identifying patients
with COPD most likely to benefit from
currently available therapies. Identifying
milder, symptomatic patients with
undiagnosed disease would be an added
benefit, but it was not the intent of this
study. An adjudication step was included
to ensure unequivocal group assignment
(see online supplement).
At A Glance Commentary
Scientific Knowledge on the
Subject: The challenges associated
with efficiently identifying people with
undiagnosed chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) in primary
care settings are well known.
Identifying symptomatic patients with
more severe airflow obstruction or at
risk for exacerbation who will benefit
from currently available therapeutic
interventions has immediate clinical
importance for these individuals.
To date, questionnaires have been
designed to identify people with COPD
through population- or clinic-based
screening programs without reference
to disease severity or exacerbation risk,
resulting in the identification of a high
proportion of patients with mild
disease. The use of peak expiratory flow
using various methods for gathering
and interpreting data has been
proposed.
What This Study Adds to the
Field: In this study, we used a novel,
multimethod approach to develop a
process for identifying undiagnosed
cases of COPD requiring treatment.
CAPTURE (COPD Assessment in
Primary Care to Identify Undiagnosed
Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation
Risk), a simple, five-item, patient-
completed questionnaire, plus peak
expiratory flow, with an inexpensive,
easy-to-use mechanical device and
interpretive thresholds, is able to
differentiate cases and control subjects
with remarkable precision, suggesting
this is a viable approach for
patient screening and COPD case
identification in primary care settings.
Further study of this approach is
warranted.

 Procedures
The investigators engaged primary care
clinicians to identify men and women
at least 40 years of age in six diverse
geographical locations in the United States.
The protocol was reviewed and approved by
a central institutional review board
and institutional review boards at each
investigation site. After providing informed
consent, each subject participated in one
study visit, completing a questionnaire
booklet with candidate items and
sociodemographics- and health-related
questions, PEF, and spirometry (see online
supplement). To evaluate questionnaire
test-retest reliability, a subset of subjects
(n = 111) completed the questionnaire
booklet a second time, with additional
questions to identify stable patients, defined
as little or no self-reported change in
breathing-related health during the past
week. This booklet was completed at home
7–14 days following the clinic visit and was
returned by mail.
Measures
Questionnaire candidate item pool. Results
of earlier work, including a comprehensive
literature review (18), qualitative
interviews with patients from the target
population (23), and analyses of existing
datasets (24), were used to create
44 candidate items covering 6 content
areas: exposure (6 items), family and
personal health history (7 items),
respiratory events during the prior 12 months
(6 items), respiratory symptoms (12 items),
other symptoms (5 items), and impact or
effect of breathing-related issues on daily
life (8 items). For ease of use, all items
were dichotomous (yes or no), with the
exception of frequency of respiratory
events (scored on a 3-point scale; none,
1, 2 or more).
COPD Assessment Test and modified
Medical Research Council dyspnea scale.
The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) (25)
and the modified Medical Research
Council dyspnea scale (mMRC) (26)
were used to assess the presence and
magnitude of respiratory symptoms
in the sample and to test the final
questionnaire.
Analyses
A model-free data-mining approach using
random forests (27) [RF; R package
randomForest (28)] analysis was used to
derive the best, smallest set of questions
from the pool of 44 candidate questions.
Additional information on these analytical
methods is provided in the online
supplement.
The following predictive precision
estimates were used to test the questionnaire
and PEF: receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curve, area under the receiver
operator characteristic curve (AUC) (29),
sensitivity, specificity, and overall
misclassification error estimates.
Questionnaire scores were also tested
using traditional validation methods,
including test-retest (intraclass correlation
coefficient) reliability and validity,
including relationship with pulmonary
function, CAT and mMRC scores, and
patient self-assessment of breathing-related
health during the past week (Pearson
product-moment correlation coefficient).
Analysis of covariance was used to
examine scores by Global Initiative for
Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease
(GOLD) and COPD Foundation (COPDF)
airflow limitation categories (6, 7),
controlling for sex, smoking status,
age, and group-by-sex interaction.
Nonsignificant control variables were
removed, and the model was retested
with the final variable set.
Performance properties of PEF alone
were evaluated, including relationship to
spirometry (Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficient), as were GOLD
and COPDF airflow limitation categories
(6, 7). Predictive precision estimates
were systematically tested using 50-ml
increments stratified by sex to determine
the optimal cutoff for differentiating
cases from control subjects. Results
were used to develop guidelines for using
the questionnaire and PEF to refer
patients for further diagnostic workup
for COPD.
Results
Sample
Three hundred ninety-three English-
speaking subjects were enrolled in the
study, and 380 subjects provided
spirometry data for confirmation of case
versus control status (196 cases and
184 control subjects). Of these, 47 subjects
exhibited spirometric values and clinical
characteristics inconsistent with group
assignment and were excluded from the
analyses, yielding an analytical sample of
346 subjects (186 cases, 184 with peak flow;
160 control subjects, all with peak flow).
The demographic and clinical
characteristics of the analytical sample, cases,
and control subjects are shown in Table 1.
Sample characteristics for groups comprising
cases (group 1 [n = 97] and group 2 [n = 89])
and control subjects (group 3 [n = 87] and
group 4 [n = 73]) are provided in Tables E1
and E2 in the online supplement.
Questionnaire Item Reduction
Using RF, the 44 candidate items were
reduced to 34-item, 21-item, and finally to
one 8-item and two different 5-item sets.
Throughout the reduction process, the
item sets maintained good performance,
consistently misclassifying less than 27%
of cases and control subjects, and with
sensitivity greater than 80% and specificity
greater than 70% (Figure E1A).
Segregating cases from control subjects
with no COPD was more precise,
misclassifying less than 14% of subjects
and with sensitivity greater than 85% and
specificity greater than 88% (Figure E1B).
All estimates improved with PEF in the
model. Content coverage for the final three
candidate sets is shown in Table E3.
Final Questionnaire
The final questionnaire selected for further
testing, CAPTURE (COPD Assessment in
Primary Care to Identify Undiagnosed
Respiratory Disease and Exacerbation Risk),
is shown in Figure 1. Various scoring
algorithms were tested, including weighted
and unweighted summation, with clinical
use in mind (efficient and precise). The
selected algorithm is a simple summation of
patient responses to each of the five items,
yielding a questionnaire score ranging
from 0 (“no” to all 5 questions) to 6 (“yes” to
all questions and at least two respiratory
events during the past year). Score
distributions for cases and control subjects
and by group are provided in Table E4.
Precision estimates for two scoring
thresholds when using the questionnaire
alone, without PEF, are shown in Table E5,
for clinicians who wish to use only the
questionnaire to predict the need for
spirometry.
The receiver operating characteristic
curve and AUC for CAPTURE scores are
shown in Figure 2. The performance of

 the final, recommended threshold for
CAPTURE alone is shown in Table 2.
Test-retest reliability (intraclass
correlation coefficient) was 0.85 (n = 111).
CAPTURE scores were significantly
related to spirometry, based on the
following data: FEV1 (r = 0.47), FEV1
percent predicted (r = 0.53), and
FEV1/FVC ratio (r = 0.50) (all P , 0.0001;
n = 344); and CAT (r = 0.74), mMRC
rating (r = 0.58), and self-assessment of
breathing-related health (r = 0.65) (all P ,
0.0001; n = 346). Differentiation of GOLD
(F = 28.67) and COPDF (F = 29.59)
categories was also significant (both
P , 0.0001). The Flesch-Kincaid grade
level (United States), based on a
combination of words, sentences, and
syllables comprising the questionnaire,
was determined to be 6.4 years, indicating
that this new questionnaire should be
comprehensible to adults with a sixth-
grade education level or above (30).
PEF
PEF was significantly correlated with
spirometric values (P , 0.0001; n = 344),
including FEV1 (r = 0.82), FEV1 percent
predicted (r = 0.70), and FEV1/FVC ratio
(r = 0.64), and with differentiated GOLD

 (7) and COPDF categories (6) (Figure E2).
PEF values distinguished cases from
control subjects (P , 0.0001), as well
as groups 1–4 (P , 0.0001) (Figure E3),
but they were unable to differentiate
patients with COPD with previous
exacerbation (group 1) from COPD
cases with an FEV1 less than 60% of
predicted (Group 2).
Using sensitivity and specificity data,
the following cutoff scores were selected for
identifying cases of clinically significant
COPD using PEF alone: males, less than
350 L/min; females, less than 250 L/min
(Figure E4). Sample sensitivity, specificity,
and overall prediction error for these
thresholds are shown in Table 2. Estimates
by sex are provided in Table E6.
Questionnaire with PEF
The best method for predicting cases versus
control subjects or group membership was
a combination of questionnaire and PEF,
where PEF is used only for midrange
scores, as explained below. The
performance of the questionnaire with
selective use of PEF is shown in Table 2.
The AUC for CAPTURE alone was
inferior to that of CAPTURE with selective
use of PEF (P , 0.0001). Similarly, the
AUC for PEF alone was inferior to that
of CAPTURE with selective use of PEF
(P = 0.0065). Under our scoring scenario,
patients with scores of 0 or 1 are not
considered at risk of exacerbation or
COPD with an FEV1 less than 60% of
predicted; they would not require further
evaluation. Those with a score of 5 or 6
(“yes” answer to all items) are considered
to have a high likelihood of symptomatic
respiratory disease and/or exacerbation
risk and should be referred for further
evaluation, including spirometry. Thus, for
low scores (0 or 1) or high scores (5 or 6),
PEF testing is not required. Patients
scoring in the middle range (2–4) undergo
PEF testing, applying the 350/250
interpretation thresholds. In our sample,
with four roughly equal-sized subject
groups of exacerbation risk, severity risk,
no COPD, and mild COPD, 52% of the
subjects required PEF to determine if
further diagnostic evaluation was
indicated. The other 48% needed only
the questionnaire.
Discussion
COPD leads to substantial morbidity and
mortality worldwide, appears to be greatly
underdiagnosed, and is frequently first
diagnosed after significant loss of lung
function or at the time of an exacerbation.
Earlier detection of COPD in patients most
likely to benefit from current therapies
could lead to improvement in short- and
long-term patient outcomes (31). Although
spirometry is the diagnostic gold standard
(7), it is often perceived as time-
consuming and difficult to implement in
primary care settings (32–34). Even the
availability of less expensive and easily
used spirometers, such as those used in the
Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease Study
(35), has not resulted in increased use of
testing in primary care settings (9). Using
PEF to screen all patients in primary care
is an unrealistic and expensive expectation,
requiring supplies, staff time, and
sufficiently careful execution to yield
reliable results. Furthermore, neither
spirometry nor PEF assesses clinical
manifestations of disease, such as
symptoms, impact, or exacerbation
history. The USPSTF noted that few data
exist to support the widespread use of
COPD case finding and that improved
clinical outcomes have not been
established through their use (8). Existing
questionnaires have generally identified a
high proportion of patients with mild
disease (9–17). No methodology has been
designed explicitly for the identification of
patients with undiagnosed COPD who are
most likely to benefit from currently
available therapies (18). Identifying these
patients was recommended by an NHLBI
task force as an ideal, initial stage in
systematically confirming the positive
impact of COPD case finding in primary
care (22). We used an innovative,
multimethod approach to develop a case-
finding methodology that uses a brief,
patient self-administered questionnaire as
an initial screen, with PEF performed
on a subset of patients with positive
questionnaire results, to determine which
patients should be referred for further
diagnostic evaluation for COPD.
Our questionnaire development method
used data mining to select the best, smallest
set of items from among a comprehensive
list of candidate items derived from the
literature (18), analyses of existing data (24),
and qualitative research (23). This approach
was unique for several reasons. First, it
included focus groups and interviews with
people from the target population to inform
the content and wording of the candidate
questions. Second, we generated a
comprehensive item pool based on the
literature, existing data, and patient
insight, with all questions treated as
viable candidates for the final instrument.

 Third, we used RF analysis, rather than
bivariate or multivariate statistical models,
for item selection. RF is completely model-
free; it does not presume any distribution
for predictor variables, linear or otherwise,
and takes into account the entanglement,
or hidden interactions, of predictor
variables, which would otherwise have
to be poorly specified or missed
completely. This method uses the full
complexity of the data file, enabling
patterns to emerge that traditional
techniques would overlook.
CAPTURE is a short, five-item
questionnaire that can be easily completed
by patients in primary care settings prior to
or during a clinic visit. Simple yes-or-no
questions and a summated scoring
algorithm are used to identify individuals
who may have undiagnosed, clinically
significant COPD, with PEF furthering the
accuracy of case identification. Importantly,
the patient-centered item reduction process
we used resulted in a questionnaire with
content that differs from previous screening
or case-finding tools (17, 18). Specifically, it
does not include an explicit question on
smoking history. Rather, it asks about
exposure, extending the risk assessment
beyond smoking to occupational and
environmental history that can increase the
risk of COPD. This does not preclude
clinicians from asking smokers to complete
the questionnaire, but rather assesses risk
beyond smoking, which is likely to be
particularly useful for those in high-risk
settings. Seasonal or daily variation in
breathing, the impact of shortness of
breath on activity, easy fatigability, and the
number of activities missed because of a
respiratory event in the previous year
complete the assessment. These items are
understandable and meaningful to patients
(23) and, taken together, yield important
information for clinicians on risk factors
for and health effects of lung disease that
could be allayed through education and
treatment.
We propose a case-finding
methodology that integrates a simple,
self-administered questionnaire with the
selective use of PEF measurement to
optimize sensitivity, specificity, and
efficiency. Individuals with midrange
CAPTURE scores (2–4) undergo PEF
measurement using a familiar, inexpensive
mechanical device for a quick clinical
assessment of airflow obstruction using
thresholds for easy interpretation. We
chose PEF measurement based on
previous research (19) and known
difficulties with establishing spirometry in
primary care settings (36). Previous
investigators have used PEF in a broader
fashion to identify airflow obstruction (37, 38).
In our study, PEF was remarkably
sensitive and specific for differentiating
cases from control subjects, with precision
improving when control subjects were
limited to subjects with no COPD. Our
estimates with a simple mechanical meter
were as good as or better than those in
previous studies of handheld flow meters
(17) and simpler than results obtained with
diagnostic-quality spirometers (38). It is
unrealistic to propose or expect PEF to be
used as a screening tool in primary care
settings for all patients. More importantly,
PEF does not address exacerbation risk or
symptomatic manifestations of disease,
unless the risk or symptoms coincide
with airway obstruction. The latter has
not proven to fully be the case (39).
Our approach begins with a simple
questionnaire patients can complete
independently, at home or in the office,
with the results easily scored and
interpreted by the clinician. PEF adds
precision to the case identification process,
but it is performed only as needed.
The combination of our questionnaire
and PEF exhibited improved operating
characteristics than either alone. The
sensitivity of CAPTURE scores will permit
fewer missed cases of clinically significant
COPD, and the higher levels of specificity
provided by PEF will result in fewer false
positives and lower overall screening costs.
The operating characteristics of our
approach, which should minimize
overdiagnosis, are improved over the
majority of previous strategies (17, 18, 40);
the others with similar or slightly better
characteristics were developed in higher-
risk populations (41, 42).
We elected to develop an approach
optimized for the identification of
undiagnosed patients with significant
airflow obstruction and/or exacerbation risk
(i.e., those most likely to benefit from
currently available therapies and included in
recent therapeutic algorithms) (6, 7, 21).
This flows from the recommendations of
an NHLBI task force that suggested the

 stage in confirming the positive impact of
COPD case finding in primary care (22).
We did not specifically attempt to separate
these two groups of patients with COPD
who would benefit from current therapies,
nor did we attempt to generate a severity
measure. Importantly, our approach should
be viewed not as a diagnostic test but as a
case-finding approach to identify patients
who should undergo additional, definitive
diagnostic testing (7).
We did not attempt to develop a case-
finding approach to identify all patients with
COPD. A group of smokers with symptoms
and adverse clinical outcomes but without
airflow obstruction has been identified (43).
The role of therapy in these patients
remains unclear. Treatments that could
prevent COPD progression would be a
major advance and would support
identification of individuals with early
disease (20). The extent to which
CAPTURE and PEF would be useful for
this purpose remains to be determined.
Several limitations of this study
should be noted. First, sites included
pulmonary clinics in addition to primary
care settings, although primary clinicians
were engaged at all specialty centers in
identifying appropriate study subjects.
Further study is needed to assure
generalizability to patients in a broader
number of primary care practices. Second,
experienced clinical research personnel
administered PEF and spirometry. The
feasibility and precision of administering
these tests as a complement to a simple,
patient self-administered questionnaire
should be evaluated in a variety of primary
care clinical settings. Third, we enrolled a
limited number of patients with mild
airflow obstruction and exacerbation risk.
Researchers in future studies should
adequately sample this population because
cohort studies have suggested that patients
with COPD with lesser airflow obstruction
(38) or nonobstructed but symptomatic
smokers (43) are at risk of exacerbations.
Fourth, our approach was focused on
the identification of obstructive
airway disease; patients with other
cardiorespiratory diseases were not the
target population. Fifth, RF analysis is one
of many learning machines, with new
ones emerging regularly. It is possible that
another learning machine applied to the
same data could perform better, although
in our experience RF is competitive across
a wide range of datasets. Finally, it is not
known whether the identification of
previously undiagnosed but symptomatic
patients meeting our criteria would lead
to earlier treatment and improved
outcomes. Prospective studies testing the
effects of case identification and
treatment on patient outcomes are
urgently needed.
Conclusions
We developed a case-finding methodology
that uses five simple patient-reported
questions and selective use of PEF for
identifying patients in need of further
diagnostic evaluation for COPD, initially
focusing on those most likely to benefit from
treatment. Results of the development work
suggest that this method is sensitive and
specific and may offer an efficient case-
finding approach for primary care. Future
study of the performance properties of this
method in primary care settings is
warranted. n
