abstract
BACKGROUND: Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a large, heterogeneous group of chemicals 
that are structurally similar to δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Many SCs are high-efficacy 
full agonists of the CB1 and/or CB2 cannabinoid receptors, resulting in a potent group of 
chemicals with a variety of negative health effects, including death. SCs are available to 
adolescents at convenience stores and smoke shops and on the Internet. However, little 
is known about the risk factors that contribute to eventual use of SCs in adolescents, and 
no research has examined the psychiatric, personality, and substance-use risk factors 
that prospectively predict SC use. On the basis of extant cross-sectional research, we 
hypothesized that anxiety, depression, impulsivity, and marijuana use would prospectively 
predict eventual SC use.
METHODS: Data were collected across 2 time points 12 months apart on adolescents attending 
multiple public high schools in southeast Texas (n = 964).
RESULTS: Path analysis indicated that depressive symptoms, marijuana use, alcohol use, and 
SC use at baseline were predictive of SC use at 1-year follow-up, whereas anxiety symptoms 
and impulsivity were not. In addition, SC use at baseline was not predictive of marijuana 
use at the 1-year follow-up. Females and African Americans were less likely to use SCs than 
males or those of other ethnicities.
CONCLUSIONS: SC-use prevention programming should consider depressive symptoms, 
marijuana use, and alcohol use as risk factors for SC use. Of particular significance, 
traditional marijuana use was predictive of subsequent SC use, but SC use was not 
predictive of later marijuana use.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Synthetic 
cannabinoids (SCs) are drugs that are similar 
to, but signifi
 cantly stronger than, δ-9-
tetrahydrocannabinol. Little is known about the 
toxicological profi
 les of SCs in humans. SCs are used 
by adolescents, often with negative effects that 
result in emergency department visits.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: This study provides the 
fi
 rst prospective examination of SC use, showing 
that depressive symptoms, marijuana use, and 
alcohol use are predictive of subsequent SC use in 
adolescents. Importantly, SC use does not predict 
later marijuana use.

Synthetic cannabinoid receptor 
agonists (SCs) are a large, 
heterogeneous group of chemicals 
that are structurally similar to 
δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or 
that act on the same receptors as THC. 
1 
Such substances may be sprayed 
on a plant-based material that 
resembles cannabis and sold as “not 
for human consumption” potpourri 
or incense at convenience stores, 
head shops, and online retailers. 
2 In 
addition, SCs are, at times, sold as a 
white powder. Many SCs are high-
efficacy full agonists of the CB1 and/
or CB2 cannabinoid receptors, 
 
3 
resulting in SCs that are often much 
more potent than THC. Indeed, 
research has shown that some SCs 
may be functionally as much as 
40 to 660 times more potent than 
THC. 
4 In addition, SCs do not contain 
cannabidiol, a major cannabinoid in 
the cannabis plant that possesses 
anxiolytic and antipsychotic 
properties.5, 
 
6 It is thought that 
the potency of SCs combined with 
the lack of cannabidiol make SCs 
potentially psychosis-inducing. 
4 
Although a number of SCs have been 
outlawed to possess or sell in the 
United States, 
 
7 SCs remain readily 
available and producers often 
replace recently outlawed SCs with 
novel SCs.
Recent reports have shown that 
SCs appeal to adolescents and 
young adults due to their perceived 
legality, affordable cost, attractive 
labeling, and their inability to be 
detected in urine drug screens. 
4, 
 
8, 
 
9 
Indeed, many adolescents involved 
with the criminal justice system 
(eg, probation) who are court-
mandated to drug urinalysis report 
avoiding a positive drug test, which 
SCs successfully do on routine drug 
urinalysis panels, as a primary reason 
for use. 
9 These findings are also seen 
among adult SC users, with 1 study 
finding that 71% of ever-SC users 
enrolled in drug treatment reported 
avoiding a positive drug test as a 
primary reason for use.10 Clearly, 
drug urinalysis and criminal justice 
system involvement appear to be risk 
factors for SC use.
The prevalence of SC use among high 
school students in the United States 
has been assessed annually by the 
nationally representative Monitoring 
the Future (MTF) survey. Results 
show that SC use has declined from 
8.8% and 11.3% among 10th and 
12th graders, respectively, in 2012 
to 4.3% and 5.2% among 10th 
and 12th graders, respectively, in 
2015. 
11 Thus, rates of SC use among 
high school students has steadily 
declined, which may be due, in 
part, to the outlawing of a number 
of known SC compounds, making 
accessibility to SCs more difficult. 
Even as rates of the reported use of 
SCs have declined, however, reports 
to poison control centers between 
2013 and 2015 related to the use of 
SCs increased from 2668 to 7779, 
 
12 
representing an almost threefold 
increase in incidence over a 2-year 
period. Moreover, in the past year 
there has been a threefold increase 
in reports of deaths related to SC 
consumption in the United States, 
increasing from 5 deaths in January 
through May in 2014 to 15 deaths 
between January and May in 2015. 
13 
Furthermore, whereas overall rates 
of SC use have declined, research 
has shown that rates of SC use 
among routine marijuana users 
has decreased at a much slower 
rate than their nonusing and less-
frequent marijuana-using peers. 
14 
Although there are a variety of 
SC compounds in existence with 
varying effect profiles, it is clear that 
SC use is often associated with a 
variety of deleterious consequences 
and that negative effects related 
to the consumption of SCs have 
increased substantially in the past 
year. With this in mind, a single 
SC-use episode has the potential to 
severely harm an adolescent.
Very little is known about the 
longitudinal predictors of SC use in 
adolescents. Prospective research 
on predictors of SC use is critical to 
inform intervention and prevention 
programming. To date, studies 
assessing SC use in adolescents have 
consisted of either cross-sectional 
designs 
9, 
 
15 
– 
17 or case reports 
related to acute intoxication and/
or the after effects of SCs, 
8, 
 
18 
 
 
 
– 
24 
with 1 study examining cohorts 
of adolescents across time. 
14 Of 
these studies, 2 have examined the 
psychosocial correlates of SC use. 
Findings from these studies indicate 
that lifetime cigarette, marijuana, 
alcohol, and other illicit drug use 
robustly increased the odds of 
past-year SC use, with marijuana-
use frequency being the strongest 
correlate of SC use. 
15, 
17 Notably, 
studies to date do not assess 
whether marijuana use is predictive 
of SC use or vice versa. Given that 
marijuana is the most commonly 
used illicit drug by high school 
students in the United States, 
 
11 it is 
important to delineate the temporal 
relations between these variables 
to inform adolescent substance-use 
and prevention efforts. To date, 
studies assessing the psychosocial 
correlates of SC use have not 
included mood and personality 
variables. To inform hypotheses 
regarding temporal relations, 
we drew from well-established 
individual difference risk factors 
for adolescent use of marijuana, 
a distinct but pharmacologically 
related substance. Depressive 
symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and 
impulsivity have been shown to be 
longitudinally linked to marijuana 
use in adolescents. 
25, 
 
26 Thus, the 
current study prospectively assessed 
the temporal relations between 
impulsivity, depressive symptoms, 
anxiety symptoms, and other drug 
use with SC use and marijuana use in 
adolescents. We hypothesized that 
impulsivity, depressive symptoms, 
anxiety symptoms, alcohol use, and 
marijuana use at baseline would 
be predictive of SC use at 1-year 
follow-up.

METHODS
Procedures and Participants
Participants were adolescents who 
were enrolled in a longitudinal 
study examining adolescent risk 
behaviors. 
27 Participants in the 
current study were high school 
students (n = 964) recruited from 
7 public schools in Texas (response 
rate: 62%) who were assessed 
twice, once during the spring of 
2011 and once during the spring of 
2012 (1-year interval). At baseline, 
participants had a mean age of 16.09 
(SD = 0.79) years. The majority of 
participants were enrolled in the 
10th (73%) or 11th (24%) grade at 
baseline, with ninth-graders (1%), 
12th-graders (1%), and those who 
reported “other” (1%) comprising a 
much smaller portion of the sample. 
The sample was ethnically diverse: 
31% African American, 29% white, 
28% Hispanic, and 12% other. 
Fifty-six percent of participants 
were female. Before conducting 
the survey, parental permission 
and student assent were obtained. 
Self-reported pencil/paper surveys 
were administered during school 
hours across years. To increase 
the likelihood of honest reporting, 
school staff members were not 
present during the administration 
of the surveys and the students 
were informed that their answers 
were protected by a certificate of 
confidentiality. Students received 
$10 gift cards upon completing the 
baseline and follow-up surveys 
(retention rate: 92.7%). All study 
participants were approved by the 
last author’s (J.R.T.) institutional 
review board.
Measures
SC Use and Marijuana Use (Baseline 
and Follow-up)
SC use and marijuana use were 
queried by using items from the 
MTF survey, which annually collects 
nationally representative information 
on middle and high school students’ 
substance-use patterns. 
28 To assess 
past-year SC use, participants 
reported whether (yes = 1, no = 0) 
they used “synthetic marijuana (for 
example, Spice and K2)” in the past 
year. Participants also reported 
whether (yes = 1, no = 0) they used 
marijuana in the past year.
Alcohol and Other Drug Use (Baseline)
By using a yes/no response format, 
past-year alcohol use was assessed 
with the following question: “In the 
past year, did you use alcohol (more 
than just a few sips)?” 
25 Past-year 
other drug use was assessed by the 
following question: “In the past year, 
did you use…?” Possible answers 
were (1) cocaine (powder, crack, 
or freebase), (2) inhalants (sniffed 
glue, huffing), (3) ecstasy (MDMA, 
X, XTC, E), and (4) amphetamines 
(speed, crystal, crank, ice). Notably, 
the “other drug use” category does 
not include nonmedical use of 
prescription medications such as 
Adderal (Teva Pharmaceuticals, 
North Wales, PA) or OxyContin 
(Purdue Pharma, Stamford, CT). Due 
to a relatively small endorsement 
of individual drugs in the “other 
drugs” category, participants were 
considered other drug users if they 
endorsed ≥1 of these drugs.
Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety 
(Baseline)
Depressive symptoms were 
measured by using 8 items from 
the Center for Epidemiologic 
Studies Short Depression Scale. 
29 
By using a 4-point scale anchored 
by 1 (<1 day) and 4 (5–7 days), 
participants reported their past-week 
depressive symptoms. Examples 
of items included “I felt depressed” 
and “My sleep was restless.” To 
measure anxiety symptoms, 5 items 
were used from the Screen for 
Child Anxiety-Related Emotional 
Disorders. 
28 By using a 3-point scale 
anchored by 1 (not true) and 3 (very 
true), participants responded to 
statements, such as “I am nervous” 
and “I worry about being as good as 
other kids.” Reliability for depression 
and anxiety symptoms were 
acceptable at α = .80 and α = .85, 
respectively.
Impulsivity (Baseline)
Adapted from the Teen Conflict 
Survey, 
 
30 impulsivity was measured 
with the following 4 items on a 
5-point scale anchored by 1 (never) 
and 5 (always): “I have a hard time 
sitting still, 
” “I start things but have 
a hard time finishing them, 
” “I do 
things without thinking, 
” and “I need 
to use a lot of self-control to keep out 
of trouble.” We created an impulsivity 
composite variable on the basis of the 
mean score on 4 items. The internal 
consistency was acceptable, α = .74.
Demographic Information
Participants reported their sex, 
ethnicity, highest parental education 
(1 = did not graduate from high 
school, 2 = finished high school 
or received a general educational 
development, 3 = did some college 
or training after high school, or 4 = 
finished college), and age (1 = ≤12, 
2 = 13, 3 = 14, 4 = 15, 5 = 16, 6 = 17, 
and 7 = 18 years or older). Because 
sex and ethnicity are categorical, we 
created dummy-coded variables for 
sex and ethnicity.
Analysis
To explore whether internalizing 
symptoms, impulsivity, and 
different types of drug use (eg, 
alcohol, other drug, SCs, and 
marijuana) in the previous year 
predicted SC use and marijuana 
use over the following year, a 
path model with the weighted 
least-squares with mean- and 
variance- adjusted parameter 
estimates in Mplus 7.3 was used. 
31 
Mean- and variance- adjusted 
parameter estimates provide 
robust parameter estimates even 
when outcome variables are 
asymmetrically distributed. 
32, 
 
33 
We did not report model fit indexes 
because, by definition of a fully 
saturated model estimating all

possible associations, they are 
always perfect. We used a full 
information maximum likelihood 
method to handle missing data. 
34 
Because the individual data were 
nested in 7 schools, we created 6 
school dummy variables to control 
for intraclass correlation (<0.04; 
both outcomes). All demographic 
information was included in the 
model as covariates.
RESULTS
 
Table 1 shows applicable means, SDs, 
and frequencies for each variable. 
 
Table 2 presents raw numbers and 
percentages of marijuana (non)
users and SC (non)users at baseline 
and follow-up. As shown in  
Table 3, 
female (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 
0.60, P = .005) and African-American 
(aOR = 50, P = .046) adolescents 
were less likely to use SCs than were 
males and youth of other ethnicities. 
In addition, symptoms of depression 
were positively related to SC use at 
1-year follow-up (aOR = 1. 42, P = 
.04). Moreover, alcohol (aOR = 1.85, 
P = .02), marijuana (aOR = 2.47, 
P < .001), and SC (aOR = 2.36, P < 
.001) use at baseline were positively 
related to SC use in the following 
year. In addition, alcohol (aOR = 
1.96, P < .001) and marijuana (aOR = 
4.52, P < .001) use at baseline were 
positively related to marijuana use 
at the 1-year follow-up. Anxiety 
symptoms, impulsivity, other 
drug use, and SC use measured at 
baseline as well as all demographic 
variables were not significantly 
related to marijuana use at the 1-year 
follow-up.
DISCUSSION
In the first longitudinal study to 
examine SC use, we found that 
depressive symptoms, alcohol 
use, marijuana use, and SC use 
measured at baseline temporally 
predicted SC use 1 year later. 
These results corroborate previous 
cross-sectional studies showing 
significant correlations between 
alcohol, marijuana, and SCs. 
Importantly, however, our findings 
extend this work, showing that 
marijuana use and alcohol use 
introduce an increased risk of later 
SC use in adolescents. In contrast, 
after controlling for demographic 
characteristics, other variables, and 
baseline marijuana and alcohol use, 
SC use at baseline did not increase 
the risk of marijuana use over time, 
suggesting that marijuana may 
increase the risk of SC use, but not 
vice versa. With respect to mental 
health, we found that depressive 
symptoms, but not anxiety or 
impulsivity, were predictive of later 
SC use, suggesting that symptoms 
of depression may increase the 
likelihood of adolescents using SC. 
Given the lack of cannabidiol in 
SCs, which are known to provide 
anxiolytic effects, it may not be 
surprising that those with anxiety 
symptoms were not at increased 
risk of SC use, because SCs may 
more easily induce anxiety than 
marijuana. We also found that,

although depressive symptoms 
were predictive of SC use over 
time, this same relationship did not 
emerge with respect to marijuana 
use. Female and African-American 
adolescents were less likely to use 
SCs than were males and white 
and Hispanic adolescents, which 
is consistent with Palamar and 
Acosta’s 
17 findings in a nationally 
representative sample of adolescents.
In addition, we found that ∼13% 
of adolescents reported the use of 
SCs in the past year at baseline. This 
finding represents a prevalence of 
adolescent SC use that is notably 
higher than the most recent results 
from the nationally representative 
MTF survey, collected in 2015, 
which found that 4.3% and 5.2% of 
10th- and 12th-graders, respectively, 
reported using SCs in the past 
year. 
11 Importantly, our data were 
collected during the spring of 2011. 
MTF prevalence rates of SC use 
from 2012, the first year that SC use 
was queried, show that 11.3% of 
12th-graders reported past-year use. 
In this way, our sample’s rates of SC 
use are not dissimilar from nationally 
representative rates collected around 
the same time.
Study limitations include the 
prospective nature of the design with 
a regional sample despite diverse 
ethnicities, which precludes causal 
conclusions about the relationship 
between variables. In addition, third 
variables (eg, nonmedical prescription 
drug use) not included in this 
study could influence the reviewed 
relationships. Substance use was also 
measured by using a dichotomized 
yes/no variable. Furthermore, it is 
possible that the relations between 
variables could be bidirectional. 
Future research should incorporate 
more-thorough assessments including 
measures of substance-use frequency 
and substance-use problems and 
investigate the bidirectionality 
of these relations. In addition, 
future researchers should consider 
recruiting students in early middle 
school, before the onset of substance 
use and some mental health problems.
The substantial risks associated 
with even a single episode of SC use 
emphasize the critical importance of 
identifying and targeting potential 
risk factors. Our findings indicate 
that prevention and intervention 
efforts may benefit from targeting 
depressive symptoms and alcohol 
and marijuana use to potentially 
reduce adolescent use of SCs. Given 
our findings that marijuana is 
temporally predictive of SC use, but 
not vice versa, and in conjunction 
with recent research showing slower 
declines in use among younger 
14 
frequent marijuana users compared 
with their peers, prevention 
programming for SC use may be wise 
to take a tailored approach focusing 
specifically on reducing the risk of 
use among marijuana users as well as 
those involved in the criminal justice 
system. Notably, little is known 
regarding drug expectancies or the 
expectations one has about what 
will result from engagement in SC 
use. Given the promise of expectancy 
paradigm challenges to reduce 
alcohol use among adolescents, 
 
35 
understanding expectancies for 
SC use for adolescents may yield 
similar promise for prevention 
programming.
