Background
Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural,
social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome’s
features. Less research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects
of music-based interventions as a treatment.
Objectives
To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being including quality of
life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour, and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more
weeks after the end of treatment.
Search methods
We searched ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 14 April
2010 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were also carried out on 3 July 2015
in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, psycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature
sources. On 12 April 2016, we searched the major databases for new studies for future evaluation.
Selection criteria
We included randomized controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that
measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities.

 Data collection and analysis
Two reviewers worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess
methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant
subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random-effects models.
Main results
We included 17 studies. Sixteen studies with a total of 620 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Participants in the studies
had dementia of varying degrees of severity, but all were resident in institutions. Five studies delivered an individual music intervention;
in the others, the intervention was delivered to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical
elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of
detection or other bias. At the end of treatment, we found low-quality evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions may have
little or no effect on emotional well-being and quality of life (standardized mean difference, SMD 0.32, 95% CI −0.08 to 0.71; 6
studies, 181 participants), overall behaviour problems (SMD −0.20, 95% CI −0.56 to 0.17; 6 studies, 209 participants) and cognition
(SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.04 to 0.45; 6 studies, 257 participants). We found moderate-quality evidence that they reduce depressive
symptoms (SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.48 to −0.07; 9 studies, 376 participants), but do not decrease agitation or aggression (SMD
−0.08, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.14; 12 studies, 515 participants). The quality of the evidence on anxiety and social behaviour was very
low, so effects were very uncertain. The evidence for all long-term outcomes was also of very low quality.
Authors’ conclusions
Providing people with dementia with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive
symptoms but has little or no effect on agitation or aggression. There may also be little or no effect on emotional well-being or quality
of life, overall behavioural problems and cognition. We are uncertain about effects on anxiety or social behaviour, and about any long-
term effects. Future studies should employ larger sample sizes, and include all important outcomes, in particular ’positive’ outcomes
such as emotional well-being and social outcomes. Future studies should also examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall
duration of treatment and the number of sessions.

Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia
Background
People with dementia gradually develop difficulties with memory, thinking, language and daily activities. Dementia is often associated
with emotional and behavioural problems and may lead to a reduction in a person’s quality of life. In the later stages of dementia it
may be difficult for people to communicate with words, but even when they can no longer speak they may still be able to hum or play
along with music. Therapy involving music may therefore be especially suitable for people with dementia. Music therapists are specially
qualified to work with individuals or groups of people, using music to try to help meet their physical, psychological and social needs.
Other professionals may also be trained to provide similar treatments.
Purpose of this review
We wanted to see if we could find evidence that treatments based on music improve the emotional well-being and quality of life
of people with dementia. We were also interested in evidence about their effects on emotional, behavioural, social or cognitive (e.g.
thinking and remembering) problems in people with dementia.
What we did
We searched for trials in which people with dementia were randomly allocated to a music-based treatment or to a comparison group,
and in which any of the outcomes we were interested in were measured. The comparison groups might have had no special treatment,
or might have been offered a different activity. The trials had to have offered at least five sessions of treatment because we thought fewer
sessions than this were unlikely to have much effect. If we judged that the trials were similar enough, then we combined their results
in order to estimate the effect of the treatment as accurately as possible.
What we found

Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia (Review)

 We found seventeen trials to include in the review and we were able to combine results for at least some outcomes from 620 people.
All of the people in the trials were living in care homes. People with all severities of dementia were included. Some trials compared
music-based treatments with usual care, and some compared it with other activities, such as cooking or painting. The quality of the
trials and how well they were reported varied, and this affected our confidence in the results. First, we looked at outcomes immediately
after a course of therapy ended. From our results, we could be moderately confident that music-based treatments improve symptoms
of depression, but do not help with agitated or aggressive behaviour. We were less confident in our results on emotional well-being
including quality of life, overall behavioural problems, and cognition, but music-based treatments may have little or no effect on these
outcomes. We had very little confidence in our results on anxiety and social interaction. Some studies also looked to see whether there
were any lasting effects four weeks or more after treatment ended. However, there were few data and we were very uncertain about the
results. Further trials are likely to have a significant impact on what we know about the effects of music-based treatments for people
with dementia, and so continuing research is important.

Description of the condition
Dementia is a clinical syndrome characterised by progressive de-
cline in cognitive functions. Dementia of the Alzheimer’s type is
the most common form of dementia, followed by vascular de-
mentia, Lewy body dementia and frontotemporal dementia (ADI
2015).
Dementia is a collective name for progressive degenerative brain
syndromes which affect memory, thinking, behaviour and emo-
tion (ADI 2015). Symptoms may include:
• loss of memory;
• difficulty in finding the right words or understanding what
people are saying;
• difficulty in performing previously routine tasks;
• personality and mood changes.
Alzheimer’s Disease International estimates that worldwide cur-
rently 46.8 million people are suffering from dementia; and that
this figure will increase to 74.7 million by 2030 and to 131.5 mil-
lion people by 2050 (ADI 2015).
Research is pursuing a variety of promising findings related to de-
scribing the causes of dementia and for the treatment of demen-
tia. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited
ability to treat many of the syndrome’s features. Little research has
been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments.
As dementia is due to damage to the brain, one approach is to limit
the extent and rate of progression of the pathological processes
producing this damage. At present the scope of this approach is
limited and an equally important approach is to help people with
dementia and their caregivers to cope with the syndrome’s social
and psychological manifestations. As well as trying to slow cogni-
tive deterioration, care should aim to stimulate abilities, improve
quality of life, and reduce problematic behaviours associated with
dementia. The therapeutic use of music might achieve these aims.
Description of the intervention
Many treatments of dementia depend on the client’s ability to
communicate verbally. When the ability to speak or understand
language has been lost, music might offer alternative opportunities
for communication. People who cannot speak anymore may still
be able to hum or play along with music.
Music therapy is defined by the World Federation of Music Ther-
apy (WFMT) as “the professional use of music and its elements
as an intervention in medical, educational, and everyday environ-
ments with individuals, groups, families, or communities who seek
to optimize their quality of life and improve their physical, social,
communicative, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual health and
wellbeing”. Research, practice, education, and clinical training in
music therapy are based on professional standards according to
cultural, social, and political contexts ( WFMT, 2011). The Amer-
ican Music Therapy Association ( AMTA) defines music therapy
as “the clinical and evidence-based use of music interventions to
accomplish individualized goals within a therapeutic relationship
by a credentialed professional who has completed an approved
music therapy program” ( AMTA). It describes assessment of the
client, interventions (“including creating, singing, moving to, and/
or listening to music”), benefits and research, and explains that
music therapy is used “within a therapeutic relationship to address
physical, emotional, cognitive, and social needs of individuals”.
We reviewed music-based interventions, which may share these
therapeutic goals even if not provided by an accredited music ther-
apist.
Two main types of music therapy can be distinguished - receptive
(or passive) and active music therapy - and these are often com-
bined (Guetin 2013). Receptive music therapy consists of listening
to music by the therapist who sings, plays or selects recorded music
for the recipients. In active music therapy, recipients are actively
involved in the music-making, by playing on small instruments
for instance. The participants may be encouraged to participate
in musical improvisation with instruments or voice, with dance,
movement activities or singing.
Music may also be used in ways which are less obviously therapy
or therapeutic, for example playing music during other activities
such as meals or baths, or during physiotherapy or movement, or
as part of an arts programme or other psychosocial interventions.
’Music as therapy’ includes more narrowly defined music therapy
provided by “a formally credentialed music major with a thera-
peutic emphasis” (Ing-Randolph 2015). In order to benefit people
with dementia, those providing music-based interventions with a
therapeutic goal may need to draw on the skills of both musicians
and therapists to select and apply musical parameters adequately,
tailored to a recipient’s individual needs and goals.
How the intervention might work
Music-based therapeutic interventions, including interventions
provided by a certified music therapist, mostly consist of singing,
listening, improvising or playing along on musical instruments.
Music and singing may stimulate hemispheric specialization. Clin-
ical observations indicate that singing critically depends upon
right-hemisphere structures. By contrast, people suffering from
aphasia due to left-hemisphere lesions often show strikingly pre-
served vocal music capabilities. Singing may be exploited to facil-
itate speech reconstruction when suffering from aphasia (Riecker
2000). Singing can further help the development of articulation,
rhythm, and breath control. Singing in a group setting can im-
prove social skills and foster a greater awareness of others. For those
with dementia, singing may encourage reminiscence and discus-
sions of the past, while reducing anxiety and fear. For individuals
with compromised breathing, singing can improve oxygen satura-
tion rates. For individuals who have difficulty speaking following

 a stroke, music may stimulate the language centres in the brain
promoting the ability to sing. In sum, singing may improve a range
of physical and psychosocial parameters (Clift 2016). Playing in-
struments may improve gross and fine motor coordination in indi-
viduals with motor impairments or neurological trauma related to
a stroke, head injury or a disease process (Magee 2017; WFMT,
2010).
Whereas cognitive functions decline during disease progression,
receptivity to music may remain until the late phases of dementia
(Adridge 1996; Baird 2009; Cowles 2003 ). Even in the latest stage
of the disease, they may remain responsive to music where other
stimuli may no longer evoke a reaction (Norberg 1986).This may
be related to musical memory regions in the brain being relatively
spared in Alzheimer’s disease (Jacobsen 2015). Possibly, the funda-
mentals of language are musical, and precede lexical functions in
language development (Adridge 1996). Listening to music itself
may decrease stress hormones such as cortisol; and helps patients to
cope with, for instance, pre-operative stress (Spintge 2000). Music
therapy can bring relaxation and has a positive effect on enhancing
communication and emotional well-being (Brotons 2000). Music
therapy enables the recall of life experiences and the experience of
emotions. Many important life events are accompanied by music;
most of the time these ’musical memories’ are stored for a longer
time than the ones from the same period that were not accom-
panied by music (Broersen 1995; Baird 2009). If words are not
recognized any longer, familiar music may provide a sense of sa-
fety and well-being, which in turn may decrease anxiety.Musical
rhythm may help people with Alzheimer’s disease to organize time
and space. Patients are able to experience group contact through
musical communication with other participants, without having
to speak. Owing to its non-verbal qualities, music-based interven-
tions might help people with dementia at all levels of severity to
cope with the effects of their illness.
Why it is important to do this review
In this review we examine current research literature to assess
whether music-based therapeutic interventions, including music
therapy, are an efficacious approach to the treatment of emotional,
behavioural, social, and cognitive problems in people with de-
mentia. We also investigate whether, in the absence of specific
problems, these interventions have an effect on emotional well-
being, including quality of life, or social behaviour in people with
dementia. Quality of life is often an appropriate goal of care for
people with dementia (ADI 2016), and it is important to assess
evidence as to whether music-based therapeutic intervention can
contribute to quality of life or related outcomes.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included both parallel and cross-over randomized controlled
trials (RCTs).
Types of participants
We included people who were formally diagnosed as having any
type of dementia according to DSM-IV or DSM-5, ICD-10 or
other accepted diagnostic criteria. In order to be relevant to clinical
practice, we also accepted a physician’s diagnosis of dementia if no
data on formal criteria such as DSM-IV, DSM-5 or comparable
instruments were available. We included people living in diverse
settings including in the community, hospitals or nursing homes
and all severities of dementia. We did not use a criterion for age so
as not to exclude studies in which some participants were below
age 65.
Types of interventions
We included any music-based interventions, either active or recep-
tive, delivered to individuals or groups. We required a minimum
of five sessions in order to ensure that a therapeutic intervention
could have taken place. We defined therapeutic music-based in-
terventions as: therapy provided by a qualified music therapist, or
interventions based on a therapeutic relationship and meeting at
least two of the following criteria/indicators: (a) therapeutic objec-
tive which may include communication, relationships, learning,
expression, mobilisation and other relevant therapeutic objectives;
(b) music matches individual preferences; (c) active participation
of the people with dementia using musical instruments or singing;
(d) participants had a clinical indication for the intervention or
were referred for the intervention by a clinician. We also required
music to be a main element of the intervention (e.g. not merely
moving with use of music). Simple participation in a choir would
not meet our definition of a therapeutic intervention.
The music-based interventions could be compared with any other
type of therapy or no therapy. Control groups could not receive
any music-based therapeutic intervention (even if fewer sessions
than the intervention group).

 Types of outcome measures
• Emotional well-being, including quality of life and positive
affect. Facial expressions (in the absence of interaction with the
observer) may also indicate emotional well-being.
• Mood disturbance or negative affect: depression (depressive
symptoms) or anxiety.
• Behavioural problems: agitation and/or aggression, overall
behavioural problems or neuropsychiatric symptoms. (We
combined agitation and aggression outcomes consistent with the
International Psychogeriatric Association consensus definition of
agitation requiring presence of one of “excessive motor activity,
verbal aggression, or physical aggression” (Cummings 2015)).
• Social behaviour, such as (verbal) interaction.
• Cognition.
• Any other adverse effects.
For these outcomes, we accepted all assessment tools used in the
primary studies. Outcomes were assessed at the end of treatment
(a minimum of five sessions), irrespective of the duration and
number of sessions in excess of four. If there was evidence of no
different effect over time, then reported outcomes could include
earlier assessments. We also looked for outcomes a minimum of
four weeks after the treatment ended in order to assess long-term
effects.
Primary outcomes
The protocol did not prioritise outcomes. We prioritised the out-
comes related to emotions (emotional well-being including qual-
ity of life, and mood disturbance or negative affect) as being of
critical importance because these outcomes (e.g. depression) are
closely related to quality of life of people with dementia (Banerjee
2009; Beerens 2014). Depression and anxiety are also prevalent
and rather persistent during the course of the dementia (van der
Linde 2016; Zhao 2016). We further prioritised behavioural prob-
lems because these affect relationships and caregiver burden (e.g.
van der Linde 2012); and some may also be indicators of distress.
Secondary outcomes
Social behaviour and cognition were important but secondary out-
comes, as the benefit for the participants themselves was not as
obvious as for outcomes more closely related to their quality of
life.
Search methods for identification of studies
We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Im-
provement Group’s Specialized Register. The search terms used
were: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation.
ALOIS is maintained by the Trials Search Co-ordinator for CD-
CIG and contains studies in the areas of dementia prevention, de-
mentia treatment and cognitive enhancement in the healthy. De-
tails of the search strategies used for the retrieval of reports of trials
from the healthcare databases, the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and conference proceedings can be
viewed in the ‘Methods used in reviews’ section within the editorial
information about the Dementia and Cognitive Improvement
Group. To view a list of all sources searched for ALOIS see About
ALOIS on the ALOIS web site.
We performed additional searches in each of the sources listed
above to cover the timeframe from the last searches performed
for ALOIS to 3 July 2015. The search strategies for the above
described databases are presented in Appendix 1.
In addition, we searched Geronlit/Dimdi, Research Index, Carl
Uncover/Ingenta, Musica and Cairss in January 2006 and June
2010, with the following search terms: music therapy, music,
singing, dance, dementia, alzheimer. We also searched on these
dates specific music therapy databases, as made available by the
University of Witten-Herdecke on www.musictherapyworld.de,
based in Germany. We checked the reference lists of all rel-
evant articles and a clinical librarian conducted a forward
search from key articles using SciSearch. In addition, confer-
ence proceedings of European and World Music Therapy con-
ferences on www.musictherapyworld.de and European music
therapy journals, such as the Nordic Journal of Music Therapy,
the British Journal of Music Therapy the Musiktherapeutische
Umschau and the Dutch Tijdschrift voor Vaktherapie were hand
searched to find music therapy studies (RCTs) for people with
dementia, in January 2006, June 2010, and July 2015. A new
database search was performed on 12 April 2016 to identify new
studies published after 3 July 2015. Potentially eligible new studies
(based on abstract review with two independent reviewers) were
included under Characteristics of studies awaiting classification.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors independently assessed publications for eligi-
bility by checking the title and, if available, the abstract. If any
doubt existed as to an article’s relevance they retrieved and assessed
the full article.
Data extraction and management
Two reviewers extracted and cross-checked outcome data indepen-
dently of each other. They discussed any discrepancies or difficul-
ties with a third reviewer. We reviewed articles in English, French,
German and Dutch and searched for Cochrane collaborators to
assess articles in other languages. We emailed authors for addi-
tional information when unclear (for example, about the type of
control group or setting); and for additional data if that would
help inclusion of the study data in meta-analyses (for example, if

 estimates from graphical presentation were imprecise, SDs were
lacking, or item-level data if items of global tools represented rel-
evant outcomes).
We first extracted data on the design (RCT), population (demen-
tia diagnosis), the criteria for music therapy, outcomes and timing
of outcome assessment, to evaluate eligibility of the study, Of the
eligible studies, we subsequently recorded the following character-
istics.
• Data collection period.
• Setting: nursing home, residential home, hospital,
ambulatory care, other.
• Participant characteristics: age, sex, severity and type of the
dementia.
• Number of participants included, randomized and lost to
follow up.
• Type, frequency and duration of active interventions and
control interventions.
• Description of activities in the control group if not usual
care.
• Outcomes: type of outcome measures about emotional
well-being, emotional problems (mood disturbance or negative
affect), problematic or challenging behaviours (in general; and
more specifically, agitation or aggression), social behaviours and
cognition. Whether outcomes were being referred to as primary
or secondary outcomes.
• Timing of outcome measurement including the long term,
after treatment ended.
• Research hypotheses if specified, and a description of the
results.
• Any methodological problems and comments.
• Funding sources.
• A ’Risk of bias’ assessment (below).
For each study, we extracted relevant outcome data, i.e. means,
standard deviations and number of participants in each group for
continuous data and numbers with each outcome in each group
for dichotomous data. If needed or helpful, we contacted authors
for clarification; or for data, such as from relevant subscales.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two reviewers (neither of whom was an author on any of the
studies that they assessed) independently of each other assessed
included studies for risk of bias according to the guidelines in the
Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, and us-
ing the ’Risk of bias’ assessment tool (Higgins 2011). They looked
at the following elements of study quality: selection bias (random
sequence generation, allocation concealment); performance bias
(blinding of participants and personnel); detection bias (blinding
of outcome assessment); attrition bias (incomplete outcome data);
reporting bias (selective reporting); and other potential threats to
validity. They assessed performance, detection and attrition bias
for each outcome.
Measures of treatment effect
We used the risk ratio to summarize any effects on dichotomous
outcome variables and the mean difference (or if different instru-
ments or scales were used, the standardised mean difference) for
continuous variables.
Unit of analysis issues
Only participant-level outcomes were considered, and all were
continuous measures. For cross-over trials, we extracted data for
the first period only because of the likelihood of carry-over.
Dealing with missing data
We considered if there were missing outcome data, with reasons
reported, for example due to participants who moved or died, and
how these were dealt with (exclusion of cases for analyses or were
dealt with otherwise).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We interpreted I² according to criteria in the Cochrane Hand-
book for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011: chapter
9.5.2). Further, a low P value for the Chi² statistic indicated het-
erogeneity of intervention effects, which we evaluated against the
combined ’usual care’ and ’other activities’ control groups. Because
of small numbers of participants and studies for most outcomes, a
non-significant P value was not decisive in the evaluation of con-
sistency, and we also considered overlap of confidence intervals in
the forest plots.
Assessment of reporting biases
Selective outcome reporting is covered by the risk of bias assess-
ment, and for this we searched the articles about included stud-
ies and related articles for references to study protocols and trial
registrations. If available, we compared with outcomes and pri-
oritisation of outcomes in the article. If no research protocol was
available, risk of reporting bias was set to either unclear, or high
when appropriate. To detect possible publication bias, we exam-
ined funnel plots for outcomes with at least 10 studies available.
Data synthesis
We included studies about all eligible interventions in similar
groups of people in different stages of dementia, and we pooled
the results of studies that examined effects on the same seven out-
comes. We discriminated between effects at the end of treatment,
and long-term effects (a minimum of four weeks after treatment
ended). In case of clinically homogeneous studies, results would
have been combined using a fixed-effect model. In case of statisti-
cal heterogeneity (assessed by visual inspection of the forest plots)
and the availability of at least five studies, a random-effects model
was used.

Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 We were interested in both usual care and other activity-control in-
terventions because usual practice with regard to activities offered
is variable, and the question as to whether music-based therapeutic
interventions should be introduced and the question as to whether
they are superior to other activities are both relevant in practice.
We presented data by type of control intervention: usual care or
other activities. A control group with other activities controls for
increased social contact and stimulation. However, it is unclear
whether this increases or decreases contrast with the music-based
intervention group for different outcomes (e.g. agitation, anxiety).
We therefore analysed effects against all control groups as planned
in the protocol, but for purposes of possible hypothesis generation
we present forest plots by subgroup.
With probable selective outcome reporting, we ran the analyses
for the reported outcomes while omitting the particular study, to
evaluate change and direction of change of the estimate.
Sensitivity analysis
Post hoc, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses because there
are different possible criteria as to what constitutes music therapy,
and because funding related to music therapy potentially involves
an intellectual conflict of interest. We first reran all analyses on
end-of-treatment effects with studies in which the intervention
was probably or definitely (when mentioned explicitly) delivered
by a professional music therapist only. Second, we restricted these
analyses to studies definitely delivered by a music therapist. Third,
we restricted the analyses to studies definitely delivered by a mu-
sic therapist and with no potential conflict of interest related to
funding or no reported funding source.
Presentation of results and ’Summary of findings’ table
We used GRADE methods to rate the quality of evidence (high,
moderate or low) behind each effect estimate in the review (Guyatt
2011). This rating refers to our level of confidence that the esti-
mate reflects the true effect, taking account of risk of bias in the in-
cluded studies, inconsistency between studies, imprecision in the
effect estimate, indirectness in addressing our review question and
the risk of publication bias. We produced ’Summary of findings’
tables for end-of-treatment and long-term outcome comparisons
to show the effect estimate and the quantity and quality of the
supporting evidence for outcomes for which more studies were
available. The summary of findings was generated with Review
Manager 5 (RevMan 5) data imported into the GradePro Guide-
line Development Tool (2015).

Description of studies
Results of the search
The total number of included studies was 17. For the first version
of this review (Vink 2003), we identified 354 references related
to music-based interventions and dementia (Figure 1). Of those,
254 were discarded as they did not refer to a research study or
were identified as anecdotal or reports of case studies on the ba-
sis of their abstracts. Hard copies were obtained for the remain-
ing 100 studies. We then discarded a further 74 studies as they
involved participant series or case studies. A total of 26 studies
remained in 2003 of which five met the criteria for inclusion at
that time (Groene 1993; Lord 1993; Clark 1998; Brotons 2000;
Gerdner 2000). In 2008 an additional eighteen studies were re-
viewed, of which three studies met the criteria at that time (Sung
2006; Svansdottir 2006; Raglio 2008). For the update of 2010
we retrieved a total of 188 references of possible relevance. After
a first assessment 16 references remained which were further as-
sessed, of which two studies met the criteria of this review (Guétin
2009; Raglio 2010b). In total, 10 studies were included in the
previous update. In 2015, due to clarified criteria for eligibility
of interventions, randomization, and more stringent application
of criteria for analyses of outcomes after a minimum number of
sessions, we excluded five of the 10 previously included studies
(Groene 1993; Brotons 2000; Gerdner 2000; Sung 2006; Raglio
2008; Characteristics of excluded studies). However, we included
12 new studies after evaluating 121 references including 25 full-
text evaluations, which resulted in the total of 17 included studies.
A new search on 12 April 2016 identified eight potentially eligible
additional studies which still warrant review against inclusion cri-
teria for the next update of this review (Hsu 2015; Raglio 2015;
Curto Prieto 2015; Hsiung 2015; Rouch 2017; Thornley 2016;

2015), in addition to a study for which
we are waiting for clarification from the authors about the results
(Hong 2011). These are listed under Characteristics of studies
awaiting classification and Characteristics of ongoing studies.

 Included studies
Details of the included studies are presented in the Characteristics
of included studies table. One article (Narme and colleagues 2012:
Narme 2012-study 1 and Narme 2012-study 1a) reported on two
studies with rather similar designs indicated with study 1 and
study 2 in the article (note that study 2 is indicated with 1a in
our analyses). More articles with additional results or background
of the study were available for five studies (Cooke 2010; Raglio
2010b; Lin 2011; Vink 2013; Narme 2014).
Fourteen studies had a parallel groups design (Lord 1993;
Svansdottir 2006; Guétin 2009; Raglio 2010a; Raglio 2010b; Lin
2011; Ceccato 2012; Narme 2012-study 1 and Narme 2012-study
1a (also referred to as study 2); Sung 2012; Sakamoto 2013; Vink
2013; Narme 2014; Liesk 2015); and three used a crossover design
with first-period data available for all (Clark 1998; Cooke 2010;
Ridder 2013).
The seventeen studies were performed in 11 countries. Whereas
the twooldeststudieswere fromthe USA(Lord1993; Clark1998),
the studies published after 1998 were from a variety of other re-
gions and countries: 11 studies conducted in seven countries in
Europe (Italy, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Iceland, in-
cluding also one study performed in two countries, Denmark and
Norway; Ridder 2013), three studies from two countries in Asia
(Taiwan and Japan), and one study from Australia. The studies
were all performed in institutional settings of nursing homes, resi-
dential homes and geriatric hospital wards. Dementia severity var-
ied.
The interventions were active (Cooke 2010; Raglio 2010a; Raglio
2010b; Sung 2012; Liesk 2015); receptive (Clark 1998; Guétin
2009); or a mixture of the two forms (the other 10 studies).
Appendix 2 describes the music-based therapeutic intervention
and other activities of all studies. Music included live or recorded
music that met preferences of the group or individual. The ac-
tive forms often combined playing of instruments and singing ac-
tivities, and some also combined with movement such as clap-
ping hands and dance. Sessions varied in duration between half an
hour and two hours. The total number of sessions ranged from six
(Narme 2012-study 1) to 156 (Lord 1993), with a median total
number of 12 sessions until the end of treatment assessment. The
frequency ranged between one session per week (Guétin 2009;
Sakamoto 2013) and six sessions per week (Lord 1993), with a
median and more typical number (mode) of two sessions per week
(two per week was employed in 10 studies). These figures proba-
bly reflect number of sessions offered, as the number of attended
session may be lower. There are few reports about implementation
fidelity including adherence and dose received, but Ridder 2013
reports that a minimum of 12 sessions were offered, but the par-
ticipants received 10 sessions on average.
In seven of the studies, we could be sure from the report that the
interventions had been delivered by an accredited music thera-
pist (Svansdottir 2006; Raglio 2010a; Raglio 2010b; Lin 2011;
Ceccato 2012; Ridder 2013; Vink 2013). In four studies, it was
unclear whether a music therapist was involved (no profession re-
ported in the older studies, Lord 1993 and Clark 1998; probably
delivered by trained music therapists but it was not stated explic-
itly in Guétin 2009; and delivered by musicians trained in the
delivery of sessions and in working with older people with demen-
tia but unclear if these were formally trained music therapists in
Cooke 2010). In the other six studies, the intervention was not
delivered by a music therapist (psychologist and other supervi-
sor(s) with no training in music therapy, Narme 2012-study 1;
Narme 2012-study 1a; Narme 2014; trained research assistants,
Sung 2012; music facilitator, Sakamoto 2013; music teacher spe-
cialised in teaching older people, Liesk 2015).
Seven of the 17 studies compared the music intervention with an
active control intervention, all with the same number of sessions
and frequency as the music group. Two-armed studies compared
with the following interventions: reading (Cooke 2010; Guétin
2009), a cognitive stimulation intervention (Liesk 2015), paint-
ing (Narme 2012-study 1), cooking (Narme 2012-study 1 and
Narme 2012-study 1a - also referred to as study 2; Narme 2014),
or variable recreational activities which included handwork, play-
ing shuffleboard, and also cooking and puzzle games (Vink 2013).
Two studies had three arms with the active control group working
on jigsaw puzzles (Lord 1993); or receiving a passive group music
intervention which did not meet our inclusion criteria for a ther-
apeutic music-based intervention (Sakamoto 2013).
The outcomes ’emotional well-being’ including quality of life,
mood disturbance or negative affect (also as part of behavioural
scales), and ’behavioural problems’ (agitation or aggression, and
behaviour overall) and ’cognition’ were often assessed. Social be-
haviour was less commonly assessed (Lord 1993; Narme 2012-
study 1; Narme 2012-study 1a; Narme 2014); and the meta-analy-
ses of end-of-treatment scores included only the three studies from
Narme and colleagues. The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inven-
tory (CMAI, for agitation; Cohen-Mansfield 1986), Mini-Men-
tal State Examination (MMSE, for cognition; Folstein 1975), and
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI, for behaviour; Cummings
1994) in particular were frequently used. Item-level NPI outcome
data were reported in the article or the author additionally pro-
vided data about depression, anxiety, and agitation outcomes.
Excluded studies
We screened a total of 737 records and we excluded 652 (Figure
1). We excluded 69 of 85 records examined in full text (see
Characteristics of excluded studies for a selection of excluded stud-
12

 ies which were close but did not qualify upon careful considera-
tion). They were often excluded because the participants did not
have dementia, or because of a design other than an RCT. Fur-
ther, and often less obvious, we critically reviewed whether the
intervention met the inclusion criteria for a music-based thera-
peutic intervention, and whether the reported outcomes included
any assessments after fewer than five sessions. There are a num-
ber of studies on group music interventions such as group music
in addition to movement interventions (e.g. Sung 2006): these
were excluded because music was not the main or only therapeu-
tic element, or was not provided with individual therapeutic in-
tent. Further, some studies assessed outcomes during the treat-
ment sessions only, combining immediate effects, for example on
behaviour during the first session, with effects after multiple ses-
sions (e.g. Gerdner 2000). Studies awaiting classification included
conference abstracts, articles about studies in Asia which we could
not retrieve or evaluate in time, and new studies published after
the search (Characteristics of studies awaiting classification).

There were a number of possible biases and often we could not
assess the risk of bias due to poor reporting. Only risk of attrition
bias was either low or unclear, as often no or only few participants
were lost to follow-up and there were few missing outcome assess-
ments. Risk of performance bias was high for all studies because
participants and staff could not be blinded to the intervention.
Regarding the other items, in more recent studies risk of bias was
lower and the reporting in terms of interventions, rationale, cho-
sen procedures, design and results was generally better. Still, we are
unsure about the methodological quality of a number of studies
because several items were rated as unclear.
Allocation
All included studies were RCTs. However, the randomization pro-
cedure was not always described in detail (Figure 2). Moreover,
allocation concealment was described and adequate in detail in
only three studies, all of which were published in 2010 or later
(Cooke 2010; Lin 2011; Ridder 2013). One older study stated
that participants were “non-systematically separated” into groups
without further detail, which we considered posed a high risk of
selection bias (Lord 1993).
Blinding
Blinding of therapists and participants to the intervention is not
possible. Therefore, the studies are at high risk of performance
bias even though therapists do not generally assess outcomes and
participants may not be aware or have no specific expectations or
are unable to self-report. The outcomes were assessed unblinded,
by the research team or unblinded nurses, in at least four stud-
ies (Figure 2). For example, Narme and colleagues describe two
studies differing in detection bias (Narme 2012-study 1; Narme
2012-study 1a). The first study involved a high risk of detection
bias because the outcomes ’anxiety’ (measured with the State-Trait
Anxiety Inventory for adults, STAI-A) and, as assessed from the
first two minutes of filmed interviews, ’emotions’ (from facial ex-
pressions) and ’social behaviour’ (discourse content), were assessed
by nurses who were not blinded for the interventions (music inter-
ventionorpainting)(Narme 2012-study 1). Bycontrast, inthe sec-
17
Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia (Review)

 ond study (Narme 2012-study 1a), risk of detection bias was low
because the outcomes were assessed by five independent observers
who were blinded for the type of intervention (music intervention
or cooking). Risk of detection bias resulted in downgrading of
the quality of the evidence for all end-of-treatment outcomes (to
’serious’; Summary of findings for the main comparison); and for
all long-term outcomes (to ’very serious’ - all outcome assessment
was unblinded; Summary of findings 2).
Incomplete outcome data
Self-reported outcomes were rarely employed. Incomplete out-
come data were not identified as problematic in any of the stud-
ies. Occasionally death, hospitalisation, acute illness, or no inter-
est in the therapy occurred across the different study arms; and
cases with no outcome data were not included in the analyses.
Therefore, attrition bias was probably not highly prevalent, and
probably did not affect the pooled estimates. Newer studies often
visualized cases lost to follow-up and missing outcome assessment
in detail using flow diagrams. Nevertheless, in addition to the two
oldest studies, some newer studies also only reported the number
of cases randomized and analysed and did not explicitly report
reasons for missing outcome data by study arm, or how these were
handled.
Selective reporting
Most studies did not refer to initial plans, a study protocol or trial
registration. Therefore, it is unclear to what extent bias due to
selective outcome reporting is pertinent. We found some indica-
tion of inconsistent reporting of primary and secondary outcomes
which, however, did not seem to affect the pooled estimate (Cooke
2010). Only one study clearly referred to a change in initial plans
(Ceccato 2012); and one study referred to a trial registration, and
outcome reporting was consistent with the registration (Sakamoto
2013). We did not downgrade the quality of the evidence because
of unclear risk of selective reporting.
Regarding publication bias: funnel plots for outcomes with suffi-
cient studies (anxiety, 11 studies of which one with both a ’usual
care’ and ’other activity’ control group, Figure 4; and agitation or
aggression, 12 studies, also one with two types of control groups,
Figure 5) indicate possible publication bias for the anxiety out-
come. For anxiety, the largest effects were found in studies with the
largest standard error, and publications about studies with small
effects and large standard error might be missing.
Other potential sources of bias
We found some potential other sources of bias. Outcome assess-
ment may be either imprecise or biased by the use of non-vali-
dated outcome measures with suboptimal distributions (such as
skewed distributions, e.g. number of times yelling was observed;
Clark 1998) and different procedures for the baseline and out-
come assessment (Sakamoto 2013). Further, we found problems
with the reporting of outcomes or we suspected errors (Lord 1993;
and for this reason, Hong 2011 was moved to Studies awaiting
classification). Implementation fidelity, including non-adherence,
was infrequently described, but Liesk 2015, the only study with
null findings, reported on this in detail. Finally, there may be bias
through a financial or intellectual conflict of interest when fund-
ing was provided by a source with a potential interest in the effec-
tiveness of music therapy. This may apply to two studies (Ceccato
2012; Ridder 2013), but it should be noted that no source of fund-
ing was reported for more studies (Lord 1993; Clark 1998; Raglio
2010a; Raglio 2010b; Lin 2011; Liesk 2015). Only two studies
were both definitely delivered by a music therapist and funded by
a source unrelated to music or music therapy (no potential finan-
cial conflict of interest, but the music therapists (co)authored the
article; Svansdottir 2006; Vink 2013). More studies did not report
any funding source.

findings 2 Music-based therapeutic interventions compared to

effects (scores 4 weeks or more after treatment ended)
Results at the end of treatment are summarised in Summary
of findings for the main comparison and longer term effects in
Summary of findings 2.
Of the 17 included studies, 16 studies with a total of 620 partici-
pants contributed to meta-analyses of effects. One study reported
data on emotional well-being, social behaviour and cognition, but
not in enough detail for us to include it in meta-analyses (Lord
1993). Several authors provided additional data such as SDs or
item-level outcome data of scales for general behavioural assess-
ments. We pooled data for all end-of-treatment outcomes, and
for all but one long-term outcome - cognition - because there was
only one study. Of note: of the 17 studies, all but one study -
Liesk 2015 - reported some significant improvement in outcomes
of the music intervention versus control (all outcomes, including
also, e.g. physiological outcomes that we did not evaluate). The
methodological quality in terms of risk of bias, but also other qual-
ity considerations, varied substantially across the studies and the
particular outcomes.
Emotional well-being including quality of life
We included six studies with 181 participants in the analysis of
end-of-treatment scores for the critically important outcome of
emotional well-being and quality of life. In half of the studies, a
validated quality-of-life measure was used (the Dementia Quality
of Life, DQOL (Cooke 2010), a German translation of the De-
18
Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia (Review)

 mentia Quality of Life Instrument, DEMQOL (Liesk 2015), and
a Danish translation of the Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Quality
of Life, ADRQL (Ridder 2013). In the three studies conducted by
Narme and colleagues (Narme 2012-study 1; Narme 2012-study
1a; Narme 2014) emotional well-being referred to counts of pos-
itive and negative facial expressions as assessed from the first two
minutes of filmed interviews. There was no clear evidence of an
effect at the end of treatment (Summary of findings for the main
comparison; standardized mean difference, SMD 0.32, 95% CI
−0.08 to 0.71; Analysis 1.1 and Figure 6). Heterogeneity was only
low to moderate (I² = 38%; Chi² P = 0.15). There was no blinding
of outcome assessment in two of the six studies. The overall quality
for effects of music-based interventions on emotional well-being
and quality of life at end of treatment was low, downgraded for se-
rious risk of bias and imprecision (wide confidence interval). The
quality was very low for long-term outcomes for which there were
only two very small studies and very serious imprecision (Narme
2012-study 1a; Narme 2014). There was no clear evidence of an
effect (SMD 0.47, 95% CI −0.10 to 1.05; Analysis 2.1; Summary
of findings 2), but because of the very low quality, this is a very
uncertain result.

treatment, outcome: 1.1 Emotional well-being and quality of life .
Mood disturbance or negative affect: depression
Nine studies contributed 376 participants to the analysis on end-
of-treatment effect (Figure 7) and five studies contributed 234
participants to the analysis on long-term effects. Depression or
depressive symptoms were measured with (translated versions of)
the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) or with a subscale of the
Behavioural Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease (BEHAVE-AD) or
the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). Heterogeneity was not im-
portant (I² = 0%) for either end-of-treatment or long-term out-
comes. We downgraded both outcomes for risk of bias, due to
lack of blinding in many studies. Imprecision was more of an issue
for long-term outcomes. The overall quality of the evidence was
moderate for end-of-treatment effects and very low for long-term
outcomes. We found that music-based therapeutic interventions
probably reduced depressive symptoms at the end of treatment
(SMD −0.28, 95% CI −0.48 to −0.07; Summary of findings for
the main comparison; Analysis 1.2 and Figure 7). There was no
evidence of a reduction in the longer term, with a smaller estimate
and a confidence interval including no effect (SMD −0.01, 95%
CI −0.27 to 0.24; Summary of findings 2; Analysis 2.2) although
again the very low quality of the evidence made this result very
uncertain.

Forest plot of comparison: 1 Music therapy versus usual care or versus other activities: end of
treatment, outcome: 1.2 Negative affect or mood disturbances: depression.
Mood disturbance or negative affect: anxiety
The other mood item we considered was anxiety. For this out-
come, at the end of treatment, we included 11 studies with 365
participants. A variety of (translated) outcome measures were used;
Rating Anxiety in Dementia Scale (RAID), State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory for Adults (STAI-A), Hamilton Anxiety Scale, and sub-
scale scores of the BEHAVE-AD and NPI. Heterogeneity was sub-
stantial for end-of-treatment effects (I² = 56%; Chi² P = 0.009)
and longer-term effects (I² = 72%; Chi² P = 0.006). In addition
to serious inconsistency, there was serious risk of bias, imprecision
and - for the end of treatment outcome - possible publication bias
(Figure 4). Hence we judged the quality of the evidence at both
time points to be very low. We can therefore have very little confi-
dence in the results. Anxiety was lower in the music intervention
group at the end of treatment (SMD −0.50, 95% CI −0.84 to
−0.16; 11 studies with 365 participants; Summary of findings for
the main comparison; Analysis 1.3 and Figure 8), but not in the
longer term (SMD −0.23, 95% CI −0.86 to 0.41; 5 studies with
160 participants; Summary of findings 2; Analysis 2.3).

Behavioural problems: agitation or aggression
Twelve studies with 515 participants contributed to the end-of-
treatment effect analysis, and four studies with 225 participants
contributed to the long-term effect analysis. Outcome measures
used for agitation were (translated versions of) the Cohen-Mans-
field Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the agitation subscale of
the NPI; and for aggression, the aggressiveness subscale of the
BEHAVE-AD and counts of observed aggressive behaviour. Het-
erogeneity was low to moderate at end of treatment and longer
term (I² = 27%, Chi² P = 0.18, and I² = 37%, Chi² P = 0.19,
respectively). Inconsistency and imprecision were not serious for
the end-of-treatment outcome, but inconsistency was serious for
the long-term outcome, as was imprecision. Both outcomes were
downgraded for risk of bias. There was no evidence of publica-
tion bias (regarding end-of-treatment effect; Figure 5). We rated
the quality of the evidence as moderate for the end-of-treatment
outcome but very low for the long-term outcome. We found no
evidence of an effect on agitation or aggression at the end of treat-
ment (SMD −0.08, 95% CI −0.29 to 0.14; Summary of findings
for the main comparison; Analysis 1.4 and Figure 9) nor in the
long term (SMD −0.02, 95% CI −0.36 to 0.33; ; Summary of
findings 2; Analysis 2.4).

Behavioural problems overall
Six studies with 209 participants contributed to the end-of-treat-
ment effect analysis, and three studies with 125 participants con-
tributed to the analysis of longer term effects. Outcome measures
were (translated versions of) the BEHAVE-AD and NPI. Hetero-
geneity was low to moderate for the end of treatment effect (I² =
36%, Chi² P = 0.15). The quality of the evidence was low due
to serious risk of bias and imprecision. We found no evidence of
an effect of music-based therapeutic interventions on problematic
behaviour overall at the end of treatment (SMD −0.20, 95% CI
−0.56 to 0.17; Summary of findings for the main comparison;
Analysis 1.5 and Figure 10). There was no evidence of a long-term
effect either (SMD 0.05, 95% CI −0.30 to 0.41; I² = 0%, Chi²
P = 0.38, heterogeneity was not important; Summary of findings
2; Analysis 2.5) although we considered this very low quality evi-
dence.

Social behaviour
The three studies of Narme and colleagues (Narme 2012-study
1; Narme 2012-study 1a; Narme 2014) contributed 70 partici-
pants to the end-of-treatment effect analysis and two of them con-
tributed 48 participants to the analyses of longer term effects. For
all, the outcome was the contents of conversation (positive versus
negative expressions when interviewed about current feelings and
personal history). Lord 1993 reported on effectson their self-made
questionnaire on social interaction, mood and recall (combined
outcome) but there were no separate figures for social interaction
and therefore we could not use the data for the meta-analysis. We
downgraded the evidence at both time points due to serious or
very serious risk of bias and very serious imprecision. There was
also moderate to substantial heterogeneity (I² = 54%, Chi² P =
0.14) in the long-term analysis. We considered the quality of the
evidence to be very low for both outcomes and were therefore very
uncertain about the result of more positive expressions in the mu-
sic-based interventions group at the end of treatment (SMD 0.54,
95% CI 0.06 to 1.02; 3 studies; I² = 0%, Chi² P = 0.70; Summary
of findings for the main comparison, Analysis 1.6 and Figure 11).
There was a similar SMD but an even wider confidence interval
in the analysis of long-term effects (SMD 0.53, 95% CI −0.53 to
1.60; Analysis 2.6; Summary of findings 2).

 Cognition
Six studies contributed 257 participants to the end-of-treatment
effect analysis and there was only one study, with 100 partici-
pants, that assessed long-term effects. Outcome measures used in
the analyses were (translated versions of) the Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) and the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB).
We used the MMSE data if these were available in addition to
othercognitionmeasuressuch asProse Memorytests, the FAS-Test
(Controlled-Oral-Word-Association Test), or the Alzheimer’s Dis-
ease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog). The end-
of-treatment results were imprecise but not inconsistent. There
was no important heterogeneity (I² = 0%; Chi² P = 0.84). There
was serious risk of bias. The overall quality of the evidence was
low and suggested that music-based interventions may not affect
cognition at the end of treatment (SMD 0.21, 95% CI −0.04
to 0.45; Summary of findings for the main comparison; Analysis
1.7 and Figure 12). The only study that assessed long-term effects
found a SMD of 0.13 (95% CI −0.26 to 0.52); we considered
this very low quality evidence.

Any other adverse effects
These were not reported.
Effects of interventions delivered by a music therapist
and in studies with a potential financial conflict of
interest
The sensitivity analyses with analyses restricted to studies where
the intervention was definitely or possibly delivered by a quali-
fied music therapist resulted in similar end-of-treatment effect es-
timates (there was no sensitivity analysis for the social behaviour
outcome because no study remained). When restricting to studies
that were definitely delivered by a music therapist, most effects
were similar, but there was a smaller effect on anxiety. In the four
of 11 studies in which the intervention was definitely delivered
by a music therapist, the estimate for anxiety was −0.15 (SMD
−0.15, 95% CI −0.54 to 0.24; with less heterogeneity; I² = 16%,
Chi² P = 0.31; 129 participants).

by a music therapist and having no potential financial conflict

 of interest, or no funding source reported, we found somewhat
different estimates, but there were very small numbers of studies
and participants in these analyses.

Summary of main results
The aim of this review was to evaluate the effect of music-based
therapeutic interventions on a range of outcomes relevant for peo-
ple with dementia. The specific focus was to assess whether they
can improve emotional well-being including quality of life, mood
disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social be-
haviour, and cognition.
Seventeen studies have been included in this review, and we were
able to perform meta-analyses on effects at the end of treatment
and longer term (mostly four weeks after treatment ended). We
found moderate-quality evidence that at the end of treatment
music-based therapeutic interventions improved depressive symp-
toms and did not improve agitation or aggression, and low-quality
evidence that it had no effect on emotional well-being including
quality of life, overall behavioural problems and cognition. There
was very low quality evidence of benefit on anxiety and social be-
haviour. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the effects were not
larger in studies in which the intervention was delivered by a qual-
ified music therapist. There was no evidence of effects four weeks
or more after the end of treatment, but the quality of this evidence
for all outcomes was also very low.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
Only three studies used social behaviour as an outcome, and these
were from a single group of researchers in France (Narme 2012-
study 1; Narme 2012-study 1a; Narme 2014). The evidence in this
review applies to therapeutic effects of music-based therapeutic
interventions after at least five sessions. It excludes some group
interventions which involved music, but where music was not the
main or only therapeutic element. It excludes direct effects during
sessions.
Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence was moderate for depression and for
agitation or aggression at the end of treatment. For all other out-
comes it was low or very low. All end-of-treatment outcomes were
downgraded for risk of bias; all except depression and agitation or
aggression were downgraded for imprecision; and some outcomes
were also downgraded for inconsistency.
Many studies used validated outcome measures for behaviour (e.g.
the NPI (Cummings 1994) or BEHAVE-AD (Reisberg 1987)),
two widely used measures which are recommended because of
favourable psychometric properties (Jeon 2011), and for cognition
(e.g. the MMSE (Folstein 1975)). We included subscales of the
behavioural scales as outcome measures. However, there is less evi-
dence for validity of subscales compared to total scores (Lai 2014).
We combined agitation and aggression in meta-analyses because
this is consistent with the definition given by the International
Psychogeriatric Association (Cummings 2015); and these items
are also combined in the widely used CMAI (Cohen-Mansfield
1986). Some have raised conceptual issues such as overlap of a
broad definition of agitation with resistance to care (Volicer 2007).
The quality of the reporting was sometimes poor which resulted
in uncertainty about the exact methodological quality of the in-
cluded studies and the evidence for effects. Overall, the studies
had small sample sizes. Few studies reported on fidelity of the im-
plementation of the music intervention and other activities, or on
other aspects of a process evaluation. Implementation fidelity is
often defined as the degree to which an intervention or programme
is delivered as intended (Carroll 2007); and in music therapy trial
specifically, treatment fidelity refers to “methodological strategies
used to monitor the delivery of the music therapy intervention
as described in the treatment manual” (Bradt 2012). Treatment
fidelity includes adherence to an intervention, exposure or dose,
quality of delivery, participant responsiveness, and programme dif-
ferentiation to identify essential components of the intervention
(Carroll 2007), and therefore includes, but is not limited to, par-
ticipant (or staff) adherence and responsiveness.
Some of the included studies selected people with agitated be-
haviour before the intervention, or people who were more likely
to be interested in music-based interventions. On the other
hand, there were studies in which people with musical knowledge
were excluded (Raglio 2010a), or without such selection criteria.
Dropout was mostly due to health-related conditions such as hos-
pitalisation, illnessormortality. Dropoutdue tolackof interestwas
reported for a control activity (cognitive stimulation programme)
and dropout due to “problems in the group” in a music interven-
tion group (Liesk 2015), but none of the other studies reported
any unfavourable effects of the music-based interventions. We do
not know if there were any unreported adverse effects such as a
sore throat after singing. We also do not know if, without selec-
tively including people based on subjective judgement of whether
they will probably accept the intervention, some individuals with
dementia might experience disadvantages of the intervention. Pos-
sibly, effects in these studies depend on participants having prob-
lems at baseline (being selected as in need of treatment for specific
problems) and hence to there being substantial room for improve-
ment. Specific subgroups might benefit from music-based thera-
peutic interventions more than others.
There may be publication bias through selective reporting of stud-
ies and selective outcome reporting in the relevant literature. Al-
though few protocols were registered, we found inconsistencies
in the reporting of outcome measures in one study that reported
on the study in multiple papers (Cooke 2010). Moreover, despite
mostof the meta-analyseswe rannotresultinginsignificant pooled
effects, 16 of the 17 studies (all, except for Liesk 2015) reported
27

 at least one significant effect. For some studies this included out-
comes beyond the scope of this review, such as heart rate, but it
could indicate selective reporting of significant findings or analytic
methods that resulted in significant findings. Further, the funnel
plot showing end-of-treatment effects on anxiety suggested possi-
ble publication bias. There may also be a financial conflict of in-
terest if the study is funded by a source interested in the outcomes,
or an intellectual conflict of interest in case the study is performed
by the music therapist who authors the article, but there were in-
sufficient data to examine possible effects of conflicts of interest.
Potential biases in the review process
Although we have done an extensive literature search in the most
commonly used databases and also thoroughly handsearched mu-
sic therapy journals, it may however be that not all conducted
RCTs were retrieved.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
A recent review on effects of music therapy on behavioural and
psychological symptoms of dementia found larger SMDs for be-
havioural problems overall (−0.49, 95% CI −0.82 to −0.17) and
for anxiety (−0.64, 95% CI −1.05 to −0.24) compared with our
findings (Ueda 2013). However, that review included non-ran-
domized trials and cohort studies and studies which we excluded
because they did not meet our criteria for therapeutic interven-
tions. They found an even larger effect for studies that lasted three
months or longer (−0.93, 95% CI −1.72 to −0.13), a subgroup
we did not analyse separately.
The review by Chang 2015 included 10 studies, including Raglio
2008 which we excluded in the updated version of our review
because after re-evaluation, we judged this to be a quasi-random-
ized study; Sung 2006 which after re-evaluation did not meet our
criteria for a music-based therapeutic intervention (it was music
with movement); and Janata 2012 which we excluded because
streaming music also did not meet our criteria for a therapeutic
intervention. Chang 2015 included studies that compared with
usual care, excluding other activities except for reading sessions
as the comparator (Guétin 2009; Cooke 2010; perhaps also in-
cluding a study on ICU patients with no dementia). Our review
had a longer search period than 2000 to 2014 and we included
articles in French and German. Both we and Chang 2015 found
substantial heterogeneity in our analyses of anxiety, but we also
found that the funnel plot indicated possible publication bias and
that the quality of the evidence for an effect on anxiety was very
low. Effect sizes for cognition were smaller than for mood in both
reviews. However, Chang 2015 found a significant effect on “dis-
ruptive behaviours” whereas we did not find evidence of an effect
on behavioural problems (agitation/aggression), and we found an
effect on depression which they did not, despite a larger effect size
than in our review (−0.39 and −0.28, respectively).
A recent review by Zhang 2017 included non-randomized studies
and studies that we excluded because of insufficient therapeutic-
based goals and their methods and findings differed in a number
of other ways. Their subgroup analyses for effect on “disruptive
behaviour” (overall behavioural scales and agitation) suggested a
higher SMD for non-randomized studies (−1.02 versus −0.65
(text) or −0.52 (Table) for parallel RCTs). They found a larger
SMD for disruptive behaviour (−0.42, 95% CI −0.74 to −0.11,
compared to −0.20 in our work). Compared to our review, they
found a similar SMD for cognition (SMD 0.20, 95% CI −0.09
to 0.49), and smaller SMDs for anxiety (−0.20, 95% CI −0.37
to −0.02), depression (SMD −0.16, 95% CI −0.41 to 0.08) and
quality of life (SMD −0.12, −0.36 to 0.12; negative SMDs how-
ever favoured music therapy). Zhang 2017 performed different
analyses, probably comparing scores before and after the interven-
tion to calculate a SMD with a general check of whether there were
baseline differences. This may explain different SMDs also for in-
dividual studies, and the quality assessments of the same included
studies rarely corresponded with ours. For example, Svansdottir
2006 was an outlier for effect on behaviour in Zhang 2017 (SMD
−3.88), compared with an SMD of −0.06 for end-of-treatment
scores in our work. Also, in this case, Zhang 2017 assigned points
for quality because of blinding of the therapist whereas we rated
high risk for performance bias for all studies (in view of standard-
ized methods to allow for comparison of very different interven-
tions and situations) and in this case, Svansdottir 2006 also dis-
closed that the first author “conducted the music therapy.” Zhang
2017 judged all studies to be of acceptable quality, even those with
a total score of 3 (Supplemental table) or higher than 4 (text) on
a 0 to 10 scale where one of the items was the random allocation.
Finally, their secondary outcomes (depression, anxiety and quality
of life) were prioritised in our review because of the evident im-
portance for the person with dementia him/herself.
Multiple other recent reviews have summarized effects and con-
cluded, without meta-analyses, that the intervention is beneficial.
Some focused on specific outcomes such as behavioural and psy-
chological symptoms of dementia (e.g. Raglio 2012); or covered
different types of outcomes such as physiological outcomes (e.g.
McDermott 2013. who also noted a lack of evidence on long-
term effects). Petrovsky 2015 focused on effects on anxiety and
depression in people with mild dementia, but included studies
with participants who had varying severity of dementia as long as
it was not limited to severe dementia. They found that the evi-
dence was inconclusive based on 10 studies, including some with
a pre-post test design. We were able to include more RCTs because
authors provided data about mood items in overall behavioural
scales. Ing-Randolph 2015 reviewed effects of group music inter-
ventions, including music therapy, on anxiety. They found that
music interventions reduced anxiety in seven of eight included
studies.

 The clinical importance of the effect of music-based interven-
tions on depression is somewhat uncertain because of the vari-
ety of scales used, although there was no heterogeneity in effects
across the studies. The SMD for depression (−0.28) and anxiety
(−0.50; but very uncertain due to serious risk of bias, impreci-
sion, inconsistency and probable publication bias) was within the
range of, or larger than, pooled estimates of effects of medication
on depression in people with dementia (antidepressants, 6 trials,
SMD favouring medication 0.29, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.60, Nelson
2011; selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 12 trials, effect sizes
favouring medication 0.06 to 0.10, Sepehry 2012). There may be
fewer side effects of music-based therapeutic interventions com-
pared with medication.

Implications for practice
Music-based therapeutic interventions may be used for people
with dementia residing in institutional settings, to treat depressive
symptoms. Depression is very common in people with dementia
irrespective of the stage of dementia (Verkaik 2007); and it is
related to low quality of life (Banerjee 2009; Beerens 2014). It
is not clear whether effects will persist beyond the intervention
period and music-based interventions may need to be continued
for prolonged periods for a sustained effect.
Implications for research
Guidelines for the design and implementation of RCTs of mu-
sic therapy are available (Bradt 2012). For dementia, more well-
conducted studies are needed to establish more precisely the ef-
fects of music therapy and related interventions in the treatment
of people with dementia, including effects on positive outcomes
such as emotional well-being, quality of life and social behaviour.
Outcomes may also cover behaviour that may not be disturbing
to others but compromises quality of life, such as apathy, which
is highly prevalent and often highly persistent over the course
of dementia (dementia or cognitive impairment, van der Linde
2016; Alzheimer’s disease, Zhao 2016). Outcomes such as pain
and discomfort have been used for testing effects of music therapy
at the end of life, mostly among people with cancer (McConnell
2016); these are also important outcomes for people with demen-
tia. Overall behavioural scales (which include items on hallucina-
tions, euphoria, etc.) might be rather too broad for use as outcome
scales for effects of music therapy. Future studies should follow the
CONSORT guidelines for reporting of randomized trials, use ad-
equate methods of randomization with adequate concealment of
allocation of the participants to (parallel) treatment groups, blind
the outcome assessors to treatment allocation (and report this) and
be of sufficient duration to assess persistence of effects after the end
of treatment. Blinding of participants is difficult but not impos-
sible, especially with active control groups, when the participants
are unaware of the hypothesis of the study and which intervention
is considered the active intervention (Bradt 2012). We discourage
the use of cross-over designs because possible long-term effects
of music-based interventions risk carry-over effects when cross-
ing over. Study protocols should be registered and primary and
secondary outcomes should be reported accordingly. Reporting of
effects should preferably include mean differences and standard
deviation of differences between baseline and follow-up, or effect
sizes, which only a few studies (namely Ceccato 2012 and Ridder
2013) have reported so far. Funding sources should be reported
and any potential conflict of interest through possible interest in
the outcomes should be considered and disclosed, such as an inter-
est in finding favourable effects of the therapy. This also includes
cases where the therapist delivering the intervention (co)authors
the article.
More research is needed to differentiate between various thera-
peutic approaches using music: to examine, for example, whether
there is a difference between receptive and active approaches, or
how response relates to duration of individual sessions (noting
that any dose-response relationships may not be linear, due to par-
ticipants’ difficulties with sustaining concentration or the risk of
overstimulation with longer sessions). It is important to establish
whether pre-existing problematic or challenging behaviour mod-
erates the effects. Further research is also required to compare mu-
sic-based therapeutic activities in which music is the main or only
therapeutic element, to other group activities involving music. If
more data were available, it would be helpful for future analyses
to distinguish between usual care and other musical or non-mu-
sical activities in the control group. In the existing literature, the
professional background of the therapist was sometimes unclear,
or there was no information about the training of the music ther-
apists or their experience of delivering music-based therapeutic
interventions specifically to people with dementia. It is important
to provide detail on who delivers the intervention in order to facil-
itate classification of interventions as music therapy delivered by
a qualified, trained and experienced music therapist, other music-
based therapeutic interventions, or other interventions involving
music, and to allow corresponding subgroup analyses. However,
targeted studies may be more appropriate to evaluate effects of
training because subgroup analyses risk confounding if, for exam-
ple, qualified therapists see people with more complex problems.
Further studies may also focus on effects in special groups such
as young-onset dementia, or on different settings, including com-
munity settings with more people with early dementia.

Characteristics of included studies [ordered by study ID]
Ceccato 2012
Methods
RCT (parallel)
No information on data collection period reported
Participants
Country: Italy.
5 support centres.
N = 51 people with dementia and 50 of them were included in analyses (1 had only pre-
test data); 28 participants in experimental group (27 in analyses) and 23 participants in
control group (21 female in experimental group and 19 female in control group)
Mean age: 85.5 years (SD 5.9) in experimental group and 87.2 years (SD 7.1) in control
group
Dementia diagnosis: formally diagnosed with the DSM-IV. Inclusion criterion was Mini-
Mental State Examination (MMSE) score from mild (MMSE 18 to 24) to moderate
(MMSE 12 to 18)
People with acute medical illness were excluded, and a number of additional inclusion
criteria applied, including being “sensitive to sound/musical stimuli”; “the desire and
capacity to remain in the setting”; “presence of sufficient (also residual) hearing and
perceptive-communicative and relational skills”
Interventions
1) Sound Training for Attention and Memory in Dementia (STAM-Dem). Mixed active-
receptive group intervention with 24 sessions of 45 minutes in 12 weeks. STAM-Dem
includes 4 phases: 1) stimulus-movement association, 2) reaction to acoustic stimuli, 3)
shifting attention, and 4) orderly and inverted repetition. The intervention combines
listening to music, clapping hands, tapping the table, and repeating sounds. The profes-
sional music therapists were trained to administer the STAM-Dem protocol. Supervision
was provided throughout the course of the intervention by the protocol’s author
2). Those in the control group continued with the normal
standard care
provided
Outcomes
Primary outcome
• Cognitive functioning was measured with the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE), attentional matrices, forward and reverse digit-span exercise, Immediate
Prose Memory test (MPI) and Deferred Prose Memory test (MPD).
Secondary outcomes
• Behaviour was measured with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI).
The timeframe of the CMAI was last 2 weeks.
• Mood was measured with the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).
• ADL was measured with the Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living
(ADL) by nurses, adequacy 6 functions.
• Some other outcomes may have been measured only in the STAM-DEM group.
• Follow-up was planned but not carried out. No follow-up was conducted after the
intervention because of a lack of funding.
Notes
Randomization was done separately for each centre (6 randomizations in total). This is
also the reason why there were more people in the experimental group (28 versus 23)

Presence of dementia was assessed with the MMSE (Mean = 10, range 0 to 22); most
residents had severe dementia.
Exclusion criteria:
• Uncorrected hearing impairment.
• Absence of family member who could provide knowledge of a potential
participant’s music preferences.
Interventions
(1) Favourite music during bathing (receptive intervention).
(2) No music during bathing.
Following a 2-week (10-sessions) observation period, conditions were reversed. A total
of 20 sessions (bathing episodes; 10 control, 10 experimental) were observed over a
period of approximately 4 weeks. Probably the intervention was provided for all bathing
episodes and all were observed
Outcomes
Behaviour: frequency of aggressive behaviours (no specific measure was used, but counts
and mean counts across specific behaviours)

Methods
RCT (crossover).
Data collection from October 2008 to March 2009.
Participants
Country: Australia.
2 mixed-gender long-term care facilities, which provided low (assisted living) and high
(nursing home) care
N = 47 (33 female and 14 male).
Age: 3 people between 65 and 74, 13 between 75 and 84, 28 between 85 and 94 and 3
people aged 95+
Dementia diagnosis: a confirmed diagnosis of early- to mid-stage dementia, OR probable
dementia (i.e. a cognitive impairment level of 12 to 24 on MMSE) OR Alzheimer’s
dementia according to DSM-IV criteria. At baseline, the mean MMSE score was 16.51,
representing middle-stage dementia (SD = 6.737)
Parcipants had “a documented behavioural history of agitation/aggression on nursing/
medical records within the last month.”
Interventions
1) Active live group music programme (30 minutes per session) and listening to pre-
recorded instrumental music (10 minutes per session) led by 2 musicians
2) Reading group chosen as the control group activity so as to provide a comparable
activity. The facilitator of the 40-minute sessions was trained research assistant
Both the active group music programme and the control activities ran 3 mornings a week
(Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for 8 weeks, and the facilitators were trained in the
delivery of the sessions and in working with older people with dementia
Outcomes
Primary outcome
• Agitation was measured with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory - Short
Form (CMAI-SF) and overall and sub scale scores are reported for a modified 14-item
short form. Timeframe: previous 2 weeks.
Secondary outcome
• Anxiety was measured with the Rating Anxiety in Dementia Scale (RAID).
Timeframe: previous 2 weeks.
• Quality of life was measured with Dementia Quality of Life (DQOL) using
overall and sub scale scores.
• Depression was measured with Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).

Participants
Country: Germany.
5 nursing homes.
26 participants with dementia were randomized. 2 had no complete baseline data, and
24 (12 in each group) were included in analyses
Mean age: 83.6 years in music group (SD 5.1; range 72 to 89); and 84.3 in cognitive
stimulation group (SD 5.4, range 70 to 90)
Diagnosis of dementia: partly formally diagnosed with ICD 10 and partly not formally
diagnosed. People with mild to moderate dementia were included
People with vision or hearing impairment or life-threatening illness were excluded
Interventions
1) Active group music intervention ‘Musikgeragogik’ which included singing folk songs
and canons and instrumental performance, 12 sessions of 90 minutes in 6 weeks
2) Cognitive stimulation intervention: adapted Cognitive training program from NEU-
ROvitalis, 12 sessions of 90 minutes in 6 weeks
Outcomes
Cognition was measured with the Mini-Mental-Status-Test (MMST), DEmTect
(and subscales), MTF/ROF (Modified Taylor Figure/Rey-Osseterrieth Figure), Mac-
Q (Selbteinschatzung-Gedachtnis), Trail Making Test A, FAS-Test (Controlled-Oral-
Word-Association Test), BTA (brief test of attention)
Quality of life was measured with a quality of life instrument (DEMQOL) and
DEMQOL-Proxy (no full name, developed by Smith and colleauges; Smith 2005).
ADL was measured with the Barthel-index, IADL and ADL (Aktivitaten des taglichen

Also the NOSGER (nurses’ observation scale for geriatric patients) was measured, but it
is unclear for which outcome
Outcomes were measured at baseline (before randomization) and 1 or 2 days after the

of the 12 participants in the music inter-

12 participants in the cognitive stimulation
group missed between two and four ses-

12 sessions were excluded from the analy-
ses, so these people still contributed to out-
come data. Therefore, adherence or fidelity
may be a problem even though they already
preselected people who were probably in-

Of 104 included people with dementia (52 per group), 100 participants (49 participants
in experimental group and 51 in control group) were included in analyses (53% female
in total group; 53.06% female in experimental group and 52.94% female in control
group)
Mean age: 82 in total group (range 65 to 97, SD 6.80), 81.46 years in experimental
group and 82.15 years in control group
Diagnosis of dementia: participants had been diagnosed by a physician as having de-
mentia, using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition
Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR)
Interventions
1) Experimental group: mixed active-receptive music group intervention modified of the
protocol developed by Clair and Berstein, 12 sessions of 30 minutes in 6 weeks; provided
by a music therapist
2) Control group: continued to engage in their normal daily activities
Outcomes
Physically non-aggressive behaviours, physically aggressive behaviours, verbally non-ag-
gressive behaviours, and verbally aggressive behaviours were measured with Chinese Ver-
sion of the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (C-CMAI). The instrument rates a
subject’s agitated behaviour and its frequency over the previous 2 weeks. The C-CMAI
includes 29 items, each rated on a 7-point scale (1 to 7) ranging from never (1 point) to
several times an hour (7 points), with a total score of 29 (minimum) to 203 (maximum)
. CMAI frequency referred to the previous 2 weeks
Depression was measured with the Chinese Version of the Cornell Scale for Depression
in Dementia (C-CSDD)
Cognitionwasmeasuredwith the Chinese Version of the Mini-Mental State Examination
(C-MMSE)
These outcomes were measured by another member of the research team in experimental
and control group at baseline (1 week before start intervention), immediately after 6th
and 12th sessions, and at 1 month after cessation of the intervention
Cortisol levels were used as a biomarker for depression and was measured at baseline,

Methods
RCT (parallel).
The study lasted 10 weeks. Start and end dates are not reported
Participants
Country: France.
48 participants living in a residential care home which is part of Reims University Hos-
pital. At baseline, 37 were included in the analyses of which 32 were female participants
(15 in the music therapy group, and 17 in a cooking group)
Mean age in the music intervention group was 86.7 years (SD 6.4); in the cooking group,
it was 87.5 years (SD 6, no decimal provided)
Participants had Alzheimer’s or mixed dementia according to DSM-IV criteria. Inclusion
criterion: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) 20 or lower. Mean MMSE in the
music therapy group was 9.6 (SD 5.3), and in the cooking group, it was 10.8 (SD 8.4)
“Only native French speakers were recruited in order to ensure familiarity with the songs
selected for music sessions.” Medication use was stable
Interventions
1) Mixed active-receptive group music therapy, alternating listening and playing and
singing along; 8 × 1-hour sessions, twice a week (during 4 weeks)
2)Cookingsessionsasanotherpleasantactivityin agroup setting, which includedprepar-
ing a different recipe during 8 sessions, twice a week, collectively, with roles distributed
according to the participants’ abilities
Outcomes
1) Main outcomes (outcomes for which improvement was hypothesized) were as follows
• Behaviour as assessed with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI;
total score up to 203; timeframe not reported but reference provided) and the
Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI; total score up to 144; timeframe not reported but
reference provided).
• Emotional state (and social behaviour) from discourse content and emotional
facial expressions (“EFE”) as assessed from first 3 minutes of filmed interviews about
current feelings and personal history. Emotional state was quantified through counting
of numbers of negative and positive words, and positive and negative EFE.
• Further, emotional status was assessed as mood, with the State-Trait Anxiety
Inventory for Adults (STAI-A; timeframe not reported, but reference provided).
2) Another outcome (for which an effect “to a lesser extent” was hypothesized) was
improved cognition measured with the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)
Notes
Also, an effect “to a lesser extent” was hypothesized as improved professional caregiver’s
distress measured with an adapted version of the NPI, a distress scale

RCT (parallel).
This study took place from March to November 2007 in 3 cycles of 12 sessions
Participants
Country: Italy.
N = 60 (55 female, 5 male); residents from 5 nursing homes.
Mean age (age range) experimental group: 85.4 (74 to 99).
Mean age (age range) control group: 84.6 (69 to 96).
Inclusion criteria
• Diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer type, vascular dementia or mixed
dementia (DSM-IV; Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE; 0-30) ≤ 18/30;
Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR; 1-5) ≥ 2/5). Mean MMSE in the experimental
group was 8.0 (4.8) and 8.6 (2.5) in the control group. Mean CDR was 2.8 (0.4) in the
experimental group and 2.9 (0.6) in the control group.
• Presence of behavioural disturbances.
Interventions
All participants in the experimental and control groups received standard care (i.e. edu-
cational and entertainment activities such as reading a newspaper, performing physical
activities, etc.)
In addition, the experimental group received 3 cycles of 12 active music therapy sessions
(total of 36 sessions) each, 3 times a week. Each session included a group of 3 people
and lasted 30 minutes
Each cycle of treatment was followed by 1 month of washout period (in the context of a
parallel design) while the standard care activities continued over time. The total duration
was 6 months

Methods
RCT, crossover with 2 periods of 6 weeks for the different conditions
“Data were collected in three 15-week periods during fall 2010, spring 2011 and fall
2011”
Participants
Countries: Denmark and Norway.
42 people participated from 14 nursing homes (4 in Denmark and 10 in Norway); most
were from Norway (76% of the participants)
Most (69%) were female and mean age was 81 years (ranging from 66 to 96 years) for
the 26% of participants for whom this information was available
The participants had a diagnosis of dementia (“stated in medical journal,” no criteria
mentioned); 40% had Alzheimer’s dementia, for 38% the type was not specified, 22%
had other types of dementia such as vascular, Lewy body, frontotemporal or mixed
dementia. Eligible people had moderate to severe dementia. Participants who received
music therapy first had a baseline mean Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score
of 9.84 (SD 5.97). For the control condition first, mean MMSE was 5.25 (SD 4.83)
, Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) means were 5.54 (SD 0.69), and 5.80 (SD 0.62),
respectively
Included participants had symptoms of agitation.
Interventions
1) Individual mixed active-receptive music therapy, a minimum of 12 sessions were
offered, but the participants received an average of 10 sessions (SD 2.82, range 0 to 13)
. Frequency: twice a week (over 6 weeks). Average duration: 33.80 minutes (SD 9.91)
2) The control group (period) received usual care which for some participants meant
participating in group sing-along sessions

Outcomes
Primary outcome: agitation as measured with the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory
(CMAI). Timeframe adapted from 2, to 1 week (previous week)
In addition to the 7-point frequency scale, a later version of CMAI was used with a 5-
point disruptiveness scale. The frequency scale, CMAI-fr, ranged from 1 (never) to 7
(several times per hour), and the disruptiveness scale, CMAI-di, from 1 (not at all) to 5
(extremely). The CMAI-fr 1 to 7 point scale was transformed to scores 0 to 6, leading
to a maximum total score of 66 and the 1 to 5 point CMAI-di scale was transformed to
scores 0 to 4, leading to a maximum total score of 44.
Secondary outcome: quality of life measured with the Alzheimer’s Disease-Related Qual-
ity of Life (ADRQL). Timeframe adapted from 2, to 1 week (previous week)

Participants
Country: Japan.
N = 39 people residing in 4 group homes or a special dementia hospital, 32 of whom
were female; mean age of the females was 81 years; of the males, slightly lower
Participants had Alzheimer’s dementia according to DSM-IV criteria. Inclusion crite-
rion: Clinical Dementia Rating scale 3 (severe dementia). The mean Mini-Mental State
Examination (MMSE) score at baseline was 4.6 ± 3.5 for the music therapy group, 4.7
± 4.8 for the passive music intervention group, and 4.7 ± 3.9 for the control group that
received usual care
Participants had no relevant hearing disorders and no experience of playing musical
instruments
Interventions
1) Interactive mixed active-receptive music therapy intervention with 10 × 30-minute
sessions once a week (over 10 weeks)
2) Passive individual music intervention (not therapy) with 10 × 30-minute sessions once
a week
3) Control group: “Each control group participant spent time with one caregiver in their
own room as usual, without any music intervention (silent environment)”
Outcomes
Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia as measured with the Behavioural
Pathology in Alzheimer’s Disease (BEHAVE-AD) rating scale
Timeframe: last 2 weeks, but any changes were by direct observation
Another outcome was stress levels which were also measured with the Faces Scale but

Participants
Country: the Netherlands.
N = 94 residents of 6 nursing homes of which 77 were included in the analyses
70% (n = 54) were female; mean age was 82.16 (SD 6.87)
Participants had any type of dementia according to DSM-IV criteria, Cohen-Mansfield
Agitation Inventory (CMAI) score of > 44
Interventions
1) Mixed active-receptive group music therapy, which involved listening to live music,
interacting with the therapist and playing simple instruments. A maximum of 34 sessions
of 40 minutes each were held, twice weekly, over a period of 4 months
2) General recreational activities such as handwork, playing shuffleboard, cooking, and
puzzle games. Sessions lasted 40 minutes, similarly twice weekly over 4 months
Outcomes
1) Agitation assessed with the CMAI modified through dichotomising of items resulting
in a total score range of 0 to 29. Presence and absence of behaviour was presumably
measured by direct observation or with very short time frames (because it was assessed
1 hour before the session, 1 hour after the session, 2 hours after the session and 4 hours
after the session)
2) Neuropsychiatric symptoms (behaviour overall, NPI).

RCT, not clear whether participants were diagnosed with dementia
Characteristics of studies awaiting assessment [ordered by study ID]
Arbus 2013
Methods
RCT (parallel)
Participants
35 persons with Alzheimer’s disease living in “an institution for the dependent elderly” in France, with Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE) score between 5 and 20
Interventions
Intervention group: receptive intervention using “’U’ sequence: the musical sequence lasts 20 minutes and is made
up of several phases that progressively induce a relaxed state in the patient. The phase of maximum relaxation is
followed by a stimulating phase.”
Control group: “Interview with an occupational activity (such as discussion of personal pictures or news) with the
caregiver in charge of music therapy sessions with the same period”
Outcomes
Quality of life, agitation, and overall behavioural problems were secondary outcomes (in addition to outcomes other
than the seven outcomes of interest for the Cochrane review)
Notes
ClinicalTrials.gov: The study has been completed June 2015; the study has been terminated. No study results are
posted (accessed 16 April 2017). If a report on possible results should become available, eligibility should be reviewed,
in particular if the intervention meets our criteria for music-based therapeutic interventions

Outcomes
Mood and cognition, perhaps also (social) behaviour
Notes
Conference abstract. When a full report becomes available, the design needs careful evaluation (a ”quasi-experimental
study“ with a ”pre-post test design with a control group“ wherein groups were ”randomly assigned to a music therapy
group or a reminiscence group“)
Guetin 2011
Methods
RCT (parallel)
Participants
Thirty people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease
Interventions
Intervention group: ”individual, receptive music therapy. The musical style was chosen by the patient. The validated
‘U’ technique was employed”
Control group: reading sessions
Outcomes
Anxiety (primary) and depression (secondary)
Notes
Conference abstract. When methods and results (means and SDs) are being reported in more detail, eligibility should
be reviewed, in particular if the intervention meets our criteria for music-based therapeutic interventions
Hong 2011
Methods
RCT (parallel)
Participants
Nursing home residents (30) in the Republic of Korea
Interventions
1) Songwriting; music therapy programme employing song-writing activities. 3 stages: a) preparing songwriting, b)
songwriting; c) reinforcing songwriting. A therapist administered the active individual intervention. Session of 60
minutes were given for 16 weeks (once per week).
2) Control group: free time was given to the control group instead
Outcomes
Cognition (assessed with the MMSE-K)
Notes
Presentation of results (Figure 2a,b) is incorrect. The intervention and control group are reversed. There is little
variability in MMSE-K scores with either no change or change in one direction only
Hsiung 2013
Methods
Pilot RCT (cross-over)
Participants
Ten persons with Alzheimer’s disease, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score range 6-28
Interventions
Intervention condition: music therapy by a trained music therapist; no detail on type of intervention is reported
Control condition: not reported

Outcomes
Overall behavioural problems was a primary outcome; secondary outcomes included quality of life, depression and
cognition (additionally there were outcomes other than the seven outcomes of interest for the Cochrane review)
Notes
Conference abstract. If a full report becomes available, the type of intervention should be reviewed against our criteria
for music-based therapeutic interventions
Hsiung 2015
Methods
RCT (cross-over)
Participants
Persons (27) with moderate Alzheimer’s disease
Interventions
Intervention condition: “music therapy by an accredited music therapist following a standardized structured protocol
(Clair & Bernstein 1990).”
Control condition: “waiting” (probably usual care)
Outcomes
Overall behavioural problems was a primary outcome; secondary outcomes included quality of life, depression,
agitation and cognition (additionally there were outcomes other than the seven outcomes of interest for the Cochrane
review)
Notes
Conference abstract. If a full report becomes available, the exact type of intervention should be reviewed against our
criteria for music-based therapeutic interventions
Hsu 2015
Methods
Mixed quantitative-qualitative feasibility study which included a cluster-randomized trial (randomized at nursing
home unit level)
Participants
Nursing home residents with dementia (17) but also 10 staff from two nursing homes in the UK (see Notes)
Interventions
Intervention group: individual active music therapy by music therapist and training of care staff
Control group: “standard care”
Outcomes
Well-being and overall behavioural problems (in addition to outcomes other than the seven outcomes of interest for
the Cochrane review)
Notes
Needs a detailed evaluation against the inclusion criteria for possible inclusion in the next update of the review. In
particular, we will need to decide on comparability with individually randomized trials and whether the intervention
meets our criteria for music-based therapeutic interventions. Further, music therapists delivered the intervention but
the intervention also included video clips of the sessions which were used to train care staff to improve caregiving. We
therefore need to decide if the training of care staff provided in parallel to music therapy is sufficiently comparable
with music therapy provided as a single intervention in other studies

 Kwak 2013
Methods
“Case control study” but “The participants (…) were assigned randomly to a music therapy group and a control
group.”
Participants
Personswith moderate Alzheimer’sdisease residinginone of fourparticipating long-termcare centreswere randomized
(probably 120 were randomized and 82 participated)
Interventions
Intervention group: music therapy with active elements provided by music therapists
Control group: “standard care”
Outcomes
Behavioural problems overall measured with the BEHAVE-AD; however, aims and results are about agitation dis-
ruptiveness (additionally there were outcomes other than the seven outcomes of interest for the Cochrane review)
Notes
Conference abstract. If a full report becomes available, the design needs careful consideration as to whether it qualifies
as an RCT
Lyu 2014
Methods
RCT (parallel)
Participants
Persons with mild dementia (93, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) score of 0.5 or 1.0) staying in a geriatric hospital
in China
Interventions
Intervention group: group music therapy that included singing lyrics provided by a music therapist
Two other groups: “lyrics control group” where the same lyrics were read without music, supervised by the music
therapist and “blank control group” which represented usual care
Outcomes
Probably overall behavioural problems, and cognition (memory and language; additionally there were outcomes other
than the seven outcomes of interest for the Cochrane review)
Notes
We could not timely evaluate the article in Chinese in detail. The study may meet our inclusion criteria but we do
not know yet if the analyses were limited to assessments after at least 5 therapy sessions
Raglio 2015
Methods
RCT (parallel)
Participants
Persons with moderate to severe dementia (120) residing in nine institutions (geriatric department, geriatric center,
or nursing home) in Italy
Interventions
Intervention group: active music therapy delivered by a music therapist
Two other groups: individualized listening which did “not involve any kind of direct relationship with a therapist,”
and usual care
Outcomes
Quality of life, overall behavioural problems, depression (and observed social behaviour in participants of the active
music therapy group only)
Notes
This study meets our inclusion criteria and will be included in the future update of the Cochrane review

 Rouch 2017
Methods
RCT (parallel)
Participants
Persons with mild Alzheimer’s disease or mild cognitive impairment (59; but “Patient with a different etiology of
cognitive disorder that of Alzheimer’s disease” are excluded), in France
Interventions
Intervention group: singing sessions
Control group: painting sessions
Outcomes
Primary outcome: “Physical and moral pain” or “pain intensity” rated at “a simplified visual scale;” secondary outcome:
other pain intensity scale (Brief Pain Inventory)
Notes
Study completed in June 2016. When study results become available, needs an assessment as to whether people with
no dementia have been included, whether we accept pain as an outcome for the review, and whether analyses included
outcomes assessed after fewer than 5 sessions
Thornley 2016
Methods
Pilot RCT (parallel)
Participants
Persons with dementia (16) and moderate to severe cognitive impairment admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit
within a large academic hospital in Canada
Interventions
Intervention group: individual, active music therapy provided by an accredited music therapist
Control group: active engagement and attention intervention provided by a social worker
Outcomes
Agitation, overall behavioural problems, and some individual item scores of the outcome instruments were reported
as well
Notes
“A number of the patients enrolled in this study were hospitalised
for two to three weeks” only, and some may therefore not have had the minimum of 5 therapy sessions. Moreover,
end-of-treatment scores were reported for only part of the outcomes

Notes
Unclear if this was an RCT and how effectiveness could be derived if the control group received the same intervention
(“According to this results, it was shown that the musical activities with visual supportive strategies were effective
intervention for the cognitive rehabilitation of elderly people with dementia”). It is also unclear if this is music therapy
or a combination of more types of therapy. We still need to retrieve the full text to evaluate eligibility

 Appendix 2. Description of the interventions
Ceccato 2012
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Sound Training for Attention and Memory in Dementia (STAM-Dem) (versus a
control group of usual care)
A 45-minute mixed (active and receptive) group intervention delivered by “professionally trained music therapists trained to administer
the STAM-Dem protocol.” Highly structured, progressive series music sessions, with a minimum of four and a maximum of five
participants per group. The music therapists were instructed to “pay attention to the relational atmosphere” and “maintain the level of
motivation as high as possible.”
The intervention included “step-by-step exercises aimed at stimulating and checking both attention and memory.” Participants were
asked to perform specific movements, count, clap hands, alternate clapping hands and tapping the table, repeat sequences of previously
recorded sounds (not stated how) after listening to recorded and live played music. It is a mixed intervention because the active
component was combined with listening to music.
The STAM-Dem protocol comprises four phases, one for each specific cognitive function that is trained ( selective attention, sustained
attention, alternate attention and working memory). The phases involve: 1) stimulus-movement association, 2) reaction to acoustic
stimuli, 3) shifting attention with two exercises, and 4) orderly and inverted repetition. It is not clear from the text if the phases each
last four sessions, and are progressive, but as described in other sources ( not cited in the article) they are ( STAM protocol). Each phase
then lasts four sessions and is followed by the next. However, the intervention phase lasted 12 weeks, in which 24 sessions were held.
Clark 1998
Music-based therapeutic intervention: preferred, recorded music during bathing episodes with aggressive behaviour (versus
a control group with no music during bathing)
A receptive individual intervention with music, listening through speakers, delivered by nursing staff. Duration followed established
nursing routines and varied from 11 to 18 minutes.
Preferred music was recorded and selections played via an audiotape recorder during the bathing episode. Background information
on participants’ music experiences and preferences was obtained by interviews with the family member or responsible agent. “Bathing
times were scheduled for either morning or afternoon” “following established nursing routines.” Participants received either a partial
bath which was given in the participant’s room, or a full bath, which was given in the shower on the nursing unit.
Nursing staff delivered the bathing session. It is not clear from the text whether nursing staff were responsible for turning on the
music, but it is highly probable that this was done by the observer: “Initially, consideration was given to having nursing staff be
responsible for turning on the audiotape recorder...However, during pilot testing of the procedures, this proved too cumbersome for
already overburdened nursing staff.” The sessions were given 10 times over two weeks.
Cooke 2010
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Active group music sessions with live and recorded music (versus a reading group as
the control condition)
An active, structured 40-minute group music session delivered by two musicians. The session consisted of singing and playing on
instruments accompanied by live familiar songs and recorded instrumental music. The group had a maximum of 16 participants.
The session covered 30 minutes of musician-led familiar song-singing with guitar accompaniment, and 10 minutes of pre-recorded
instrumental music. A set repertoire was established for each of three sessions and this was repeated for eight weeks.
“Residents were encouraged to participate actively through singing/humming, playing instruments and… movement.” Choice of the
instruments is not described. The repertoire selection was based primarily on participants’ musical preferences, musicians’ repertoire
knowledge, and the findings from a practice session (conducted in an alternative aged care setting). The 10 minutes of listening to pre-
recorded music allowed the musicians and participants to have a short rest from performance and singing and to cater for participants

 who had a preference for more instrumental music. The sessions were delivered three mornings a week (Monday, Wednesday and
Friday) for eight weeks, with a total of 24 sessions.
Control intervention: reading group
An interactive reading session included a range of reading and social activities, such as reading local news stories, short stories, telling
jokes and undertaking quiz activities. The sessions were led by one trained Research Assistant. A maximum number of attendees is not
clear from the text. The control sessions took 40 minutes, and were delivered three times a week (Monday, Wednesday and Friday) for
eight weeks, totaling a number of 24 sessions.
Guétin 2009
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Individual receptive therapy with the ‘U‘ sequence method (versus a reading group as
the control condition)
An individual receptive music therapy method, the ‘U-sequence’ method involved listening to music sequences, selected from a limited
number of musical styles delivered through headphones, in the patient’s room. The musical style was chosen based on the patients’
personal tastes following an interview or questionnaire. From the suggested different musical styles, a musical sequence was selected.
This usual musical sequence, lasting 20 minutes, was broken down into several phases, according to the ‘U sequence’ method and
making use of a computer program especially designed for this method. Musical rhythm, orchestral formation, frequency and volume
were reduced. After a phase of sustained reduced musical rhythm, orchestral formation, frequency and volume, a re-enlivening phase
followed in which musical rhythm, orchestral formation, frequency and volume increased again, and ended at a moderate level in
comparison to the beginning phase. The style of music varied from one session to another for a given patient.
“Patients were either in a supine position or seated in a comfortable armchair and were offered a mask so as to avoid visual stimuli.”
Details on the ‘U sequence’ method are retrievable through this external link (not included in the paper): http://www.music-care.com/
en/page/treatment
Sessions were extended by a period of time spent listening to the patient. This period of time served “to create a ‘psychotherapist’-type
of therapeutic relationship and …reinforced the effect triggered by listening to music.” Duration of this ‘listening’ intervention with a
therapist was not reported.
Personnel delivering the music and the listening intervention is not clear from the text. Sessions were delivered once a week, lasted 20
minutes (plus time spent listening to patients’ responses - duration of which is not stated), and 16 sessions were delivered.
Control intervention: reading group
“Rest and reading under the same conditions and at the same intervals. “
Liesk 2015
Music-based therapeutic intervention: A ‘Musikgeragogik’ group music programme (versus a cognitive stimulation
intervention as the control condition)
A 90-minute structured active group music intervention based on the principles of ‘Musikgeragogik’ by T Hartogh (2005) which was
designated as “music education for elders.” Sessions consisted of singing folk songs, rounds and playing on instruments (woodblocks,
bells, tambourine and maracas). Participants were stimulated to improvise in a structured way according to cues in the song lyrics,
alternated with spontaneous expression of individual impressions provoked by the songs that were played or sung. It is probable that
the music used was live as the music intervention was “created as an active therapy form,” but this is not explicitly mentioned in the
text.
A music recreational therapist (‘Musikgeragogin’) delivered the intervention. Duration of sessions was 90 minutes and frequency was
twice a week, during six weeks, totaling 12 sessions.

 Control intervention
A cognitive stimulation program in which cognitive function is trained through quiz questions of differing complexity and theme-
focused conversations, a Cognitive training program of NEUROvitalis from a group in Cologne (Baller and colleagues, 2010), adapted
for people with dementia. A gerontologist delivered the intervention. The sessions lasted 90 minutes, twice a week over six weeks,
totaling 12 sessions.
Lin 2011
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Group music therapy (versus a control group with usual care that “continued to
perform their usual daily activities”)
This was a 30-minute structured mixed group music therapy intervention, based on the protocol developed by Clair and Bernstein
(1990). The size of the group is not clear from the text.
The intervention consisted of rhythmic music and slow-tempo instrumental activities (choice of instruments not specified), therapeutic
singing, listening to specially selected music, glockenspiel playing and musical activities and traditional holiday and ‘music creator’
activities. “…before the therapy sessions a subject’s fondness for music was evaluated through an interview, and the musical activities
in the group sessions were arranged according to the interview findings.”
The person delivering the intervention was a researcher schooled in two university music therapy courses. The sessions lasted 30 minutes
and were conducted twice a week for six consecutive weeks. The total number of sessions was 12.
Lord 1993
Music-based therapeutic intervention: A group music programme (versus two control groups, Jigsaw puzzle activities, and
no special treatment)
A 30-minute mixed group music intervention, during which music of the “Big Bands” of the 1920s and 1930s were played. It is not
clear if the music used was repeated every session or varied from session to session. The group had a size of 20 participants. Active music
making (on triangles and tambourines) and singing was possible. It is not clear to what degree active music-making was stimulated by
personnel or depended on participants’ initiative only.
Personnel delivering the session was an “activities specialist” and two nurses. Sessions were delivered six times per week and continued
for six months, therefore totaling 156 sessions.
Control intervention 1
This group was given several puzzle-play activities (cardboard jigsaw cutouts and pegboard puzzles), new puzzles were introduced
periodically.
Control intervention 2
Another group received the usual recreational activities of drawing, painting, and watching television.
Narme 2012
Music-based therapeutic interventions: Group music programme (versus the control condition of art therapy in study 1, and
versus cooking in study 2)
Study 1
98
Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 A 2-hour structured mixed group intervention, with a maximum of 12 participants. Music selections were chosen independent of
participants’ preference and were played through a loudspeaker. The selections varied from classical music to songs from the 1950s and
included instrumental and vocal music, and varied from ‘calming’ to ‘dynamic’ music. Calming music was used at the start and end of
each session. The order of the musical selections was the same for every session, and pieces were played twice if participants expressed
the wish to hear a song again. Participants were encouraged to play along (on percussion instruments, maracas or bell chains), sing and
improvise. Participants were stimulated to express their feeling and memories evoked by the activity.
Control intervention study 1
The control intervention in study 1 was another pleasant art therapy intervention. Painting session offered participants the use of wax
crayons, colouring pencils, felt pens and gouache painting. They were stimulated to create simple drawings, to make circular movements
with different materials and to make drawings based on their imagination. Participants were also encouraged to express their feeling
and memories evoked by the activity.
Personnel delivering the two interventions were two psychologists. All sessions lasted two hours and were delivered twice a week during
three weeks, totaling 12 hours during six sessions.
Study 2
The same 2-hour structured mixed group intervention was delivered by two psychologists, and the sessions were delivered twice a week,
but during four weeks, and therefore totaling 16 hours during eight sessions.
Control intervention study 2
The control intervention in study 2 was cooking, because it was a pleasant activity that stimulates a number of senses. There was
more interaction compared to the painting control condition. Further, more similar with the music therapy intervention, the cooking
intervention also involved alternating productive (prepare a recipe) and receptive phases (taste a dessert). The sessions included preparing
a different recipe collectively, with roles distributed according to the participants’ abilities. Participants were encouraged to taste
ingredients, and verbalize remembrances.
Narme 2014
Music-based therapeutic intervention: A group music programme (versus cooking as the control condition)
A 60-minute structured mixed group intervention, with a maximum of eight participants. Music selections were chosen independent
of the participants’ preferences, and were played on a CD player (loudspeaker). The selections varied from classical music to songs
from the 1950 to 1980s, included minor and major keys) and were ‘calming’ with slow to moderate tempo and ‘arousing’ music with
a higher tempo. Calming music was used at the start and end of the session. The same playlist was used in the same order for each
music session, but pieces were played twice if participants expressed the wish to hear a song again. Participants were asked to listen or to
play along (on percussion instruments: clapping or playing hand drums) and sing along. Receptive and active phases were alternated.
Participants were encouraged to express their feelings and autobiographical memories evoked by the activity.
The sessionswere deliveredtwice aweek, foraperiodof fourweeks, totalingeightone-hoursessions. Personnel deliveringthe intervention
were “two supervisors,” including one psychologist, with no prior education in music therapy.
Control intervention
A cooking intervention, in which participants were asked to make a different recipe for each session (e.g. chocolate cake; French
pancakes). Each session commenced with a game about ingredients where participants were asked to collectively prepare a given recipe.
Roles were distributed according to patients’ abilities (e.g. cutting, peeling, measuring quantities, mixing or cooking). Receptive (tasting)
and productive phases were alternated. Participants were encouraged to express their feelings and autobiographical memories evoked
by the activity.
The sessions had a duration of one hour and were delivered twice a week, for a period of four weeks, totaling eight one-hour sessions.
Personnel delivering the intervention were “two supervisors,” including one psychologist, with no prior education in music therapy.

 Raglio 2010a
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Individual music therapy based on relationship (versus a control group with usual care)
A 30-minute active non-verbal individual music therapy intervention, in which free musical improvisation is used to build a relationship
between participant and music therapist. During the session the participant and the music therapist have a non-verbal dialogue and
express their feelings and emotions through non-verbal behaviours (possibly by using voice and tapping, not specified in the text) and by
playing musical instruments. Choice of instruments included rhythmic-melodic instruments, percussions, glockenspiels, xylophones,
etc. Sharing emotions, raising awareness and the possibility of introducing new ways of expression and communication are a focus of
the session and may lead to empathetic processes and mutual calibration.
A music therapist delivered the sessions, which were twice a week for 15 weeks, with a total of 30 sessions.
Raglio2010b
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Group music therapy based on relationship (versus a control group with usual care)
A 30-minute active non-verbal group music therapy intervention, in which free musical improvisation is used to build a relationship
between participant and music therapist. Groups had a size of three participants. The intervention focuses on favouring the moments
of attunement that help organise and regulate the participants’ behaviours and emotions. Participants and music therapist interact and
express their feelings and emotions through non-verbal behaviours and using musical instruments. Note that this approach is inspired
by the intersubjective psychology (Fogel 1993; Stern 1985, 2004; Trevarthen & Aitkin 2001; Tronick 1998; references provided in the
article).
A music therapist delivered the sessions. The sessions were delivered in three non-continuous treatment cycles consisting of four weeks
of three sessions per week followed by one month of no treatment (washout; however, not in the context of a cross-over design). The
total number of sessions was 36, within a period of six months.
Ridder 2013
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Individual mixed music therapy (versus a control group with usual care)
An individual mixed music therapy intervention, not pre-structured, delivered by music therapists with an average duration of almost
34 minutes (33.8, SD 9.91). The aim of the music therapy was phrased in a more positive way than a goal of reducing, e.g. challenging
behaviour (“to facilitate initiative, engagement, self-expression and mutual understanding”). The authors refer to Tom Kitwood for the
theoretical basis of a relation-based and person-centred approach in music therapy.
Vocal or instrumental improvisation, singing, dancing/moving, listening and talking/going for a walk could be part of the session. The
music accompanying the activities was pre-recorded or live music, and consisted of ‘free’ improvisation or based on songs/melodies.
The overall aim of the music therapy was to facilitate initiative, engagement, self-expression and mutual understanding. Clinicians
were instructed to be aware of at least three different ways of applying music in therapy: catching attention and creating a safe setting,
regulating arousal level to a point where self-regulation is possible and engaging in social communication to fulfil psychosocial needs.
The session was not especially focused on decreasing agitation.
Music therapists with university-level training delivered the intervention which were twice a week for a period of six weeks, with 12
sessions offered in total. The average number of sessions received was 10 (SD 2.82, range 0 to 13).
Sakamoto 2013
Music-based therapeutic intervention: An individual mixed music (therapy) intervention (versus 2 control groups)
A 30-minute individual mixed music therapy intervention. The selection of music was based on determination of a period of the
participant’s life that was recalled most frequently, interviews with participants and their family, and links to special memories. Music
was selected for probable evoking of positive emotions such as pleasure or joy.
100
Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia (Review)
Copyright © 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 The selected music was played via a CD player (loudspeaker). The participants also participated in activities guided by a music facilitator,
including clapping, singing and dancing. The sessions took place in a familiar room.
During the session an eye was kept on participants to confirm that “the music was suitable in terms of engaging the participants and
eliciting a joyful emotional state.” Participants’ attention was directed to the music, and “an interactive approach that responded to the
participants’ emotional reactions to the music” was used.
The sessions were delivered by music therapists, occupational therapists and nurses, each trained for ten days in delivering the inter-
vention. The sessions took place weekly for a period of 10 weeks (10 sessions in total), and were scheduled between 10 a.m. and 11
a.m.
Control group 1: Passive individual music intervention (the music intervention did not meet our criteria for music-based
therapeutic interventions)
A 30-minute individual music intervention. The selection of music was made based on determination of a period of participants’ life
that was recalled most frequently, interviews with participants and their family, and links to special memories. Music was selected for
probable evoking of positive emotions such as pleasure or joy.
The selected music was played via a CD player (loudspeaker). Personnel delivering the intervention was a caregiver and a music provider,
but no interaction took place between personnel and participants during the intervention. The session took place in a familiar room.
The sessions took place weekly for a period of 10 weeks (10 sessions in total), and were scheduled between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.
Control group 2
Spending 30 minutes in their own room as usual in a silent environment, with a caregiver observing from a distance and no interaction
between caregiver and participant. The sessions took place weekly for a period of 10 weeks (10 sessions in total), and were scheduled
between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m.
Sung 2012
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Active group music intervention (versus a control group with usual care)
A 30-minute active group music therapy intervention with movement. The sessions included five minutes of warm-up and five minutes
of cooling down (stretching major muscle groups and breathing exercise with music). During the main part of the session, participants
were guided in the use of percussion instruments (hand bell, tambourine, maracas, guiro tone block, flapper and loop bell) while listening
to music and songs familiar to the participants. Participants’ music preferences were assessed through interviewing the participants,
caregivers, families or nursing staff. The preferred music was Taiwanese and Chinese songs from the 1950 to 1970s with moderate
rhythm and tempo.
Sessions were delivered by a nursing researcher and two research assistants trained in providing the music intervention, twice a week
for six weeks, with a total of 12 sessions.
Svansdottir 2006
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Mixed group music therapy (versus a control group with usual care)
A 30-minute mixed music therapy intervention, with three or four participants per group. The sessions were accompanied by guitar
playing and consisted of (listening to) singing with the help of songbooks, playing along on various kind of instruments (choice of
instruments not specified), instrumental improvisation, and moving/dancing, if “patients had an urge to move and dance.” The music
therapist selected a collection of songs that were familiar to the residents.
A music therapist delivered the sessions which were three times a week for six weeks, totaling 18 sessions.

 Vink 2014
Music-based therapeutic intervention: Mixed group music therapy (versus a control condition with general recreational
activities)
A 40-minute mixed group music therapy intervention which consisted of a welcome song, listening to music selected, sung or played by
the therapist (Dutch familiar songs, classical and folk music), and singing, dancing or playing along (on simple rhythm instruments).
Within the group session the therapist adjusted the level of each intervention to individual capacities. The music accompanying the
session was played live on e.g., piano or guitar and was selected with the goal of inciting pleasant memories and reducing agitation. For
this musical parameters were used “such as slow tempo and little instrumentation.”
Music therapists delivered the intervention, in rooms away from the nursing home ward. The sessions were delivered twice a week for
four months, with a total of up to 34 sessions.
Control intervention
General recreational activities, such as handwork, playing shuffleboard, making flower bouquets and playing games. The sessions lasted
40 minutes and were also held in rooms away from the nursing home ward.

We adapted terminology for relevant outcomes. The protocol formulated the objective in terms of problems only while emotions
and (social) behaviour is broader than that (protocol: “To assess the effects of music therapy in the treatment of behavioural, social,
cognitive and emotional problems in older people with dementia.”). In the review, we now consistently refer to: (1) emotional well-
being including quality of life; mood disturbance or negative affect, which includes (2) depression and (3) anxiety; behavioural problems
which includes (4) agitation or aggression, and (5) behaviour overall; (6) social behaviour; and (7) cognition. We also searched for any
(other) possible adverse effects. We adapted the objectives in the abstract to cover both the original aims and how we broadened it to
include more positive outcomes as well. Also, the protocol referred to effects in “older people” but there has not been an exclusion
criterion based on age. We therefore dropped reference to “older” people.
Publications were assessed by two, and not three reviewers independently. Data were extracted by two reviewers and if needed, in
consultation with other reviewers as per protocol. We included RCTs only because unlike at the time the protocol was written, we
expected more RCTs to be available. We accepted a physician’s diagnosis of dementia if no data on formal criteria such as DSM-IV,
DSM-5 or comparable instruments were available for reason of relevance to clinical practice and known underreporting. We did not
analyse by length of treatment (months, length in three groups as in the protocol), but we analysed end-of-treatment data accepting
variable durations and number of sessions as long as the outcomes were assessed after a minimum of five sessions. Rather, we aimed at
assessing long-term effects, analysing data about assessments at a minimum of four weeks after the end of treatment (with at least five
studies available).
We used more stringent criteria with respect to: (1) assessing whether an article reported about a music intervention with an individual
therapeutic intent, including - but not limited to - interventions provided by qualified music therapists, (2) analyses referring to outcome
assessments after a minimum of five sessions or analyses that include earlier assessments if there is evidence of no different effect over
time, (3) control group, and (4) risk of bias.
Regarding (4): if no research protocol was available, risk of reporting bias was set to either unclear or, for specific reasons, as high
(also if rated as low in previous versions of the review). With regard to (1), we defined music-based therapeutic interventions or
music therapy as: therapy provided by a qualified music therapist, or an intervention meeting at least two of the following criteria:
(a) therapeutic objective which may include communication, relationships, learning, mobilisation, expression, mobilisation and other
relevant therapeutic objectives; (b) music matches individual preferences; (c) active participation of the people with dementia using
music instruments; (d) participants had a clinical indication for the interventions or were referred to the intervention by a clinician.
We also required music to be a main element of the intervention (e.g. not moving with use of music). We therefore focused on
therapeutic aspects and elements that are more complex and required special skills while also targeted to the individual compared with,
for example, playing recorded music for a group activity. We did not require a certified music therapist to provide the intervention,
because the profession, exact qualification, training and experience was often unclear, and training programmes may vary between
countries. Moreover, the importance of requiring a qualification is unclear in relation to the importance of having experience with the
specific needs of people with dementia (for example, a trained music therapist with no experience in comparison with a musician with
years of experience in providing therapy to people with dementia). Further (point 3), we required control groups to not receive any
music-based therapeutic intervention (even if fewer sessions than the active intervention group).We re-assessed previously included
studies by the new criteria and when in doubt, we consulted the lead author of the earlier versions.
Finally, we conducted a series of post hoc sensitivity analyses to explore possible effects of using more stringent criteria with respect to
a requirement of a music therapist to deliver the intervention, and funding by parties with a possible interest in effectiveness of music
therapy.

2016: this new citation version was written with three additional authors. Inclusion of studies until the 2011 update were reconsidered
according to the new and more stringent criteria. A further update is planned for the end of 2017 to incorprate studies awaiting
classification.
May 2004: this is a completely new review of music-based interventions for people with dementia written by a new and different team
of reviewers (Vink and colleagues) from the previous, now permanently withdrawn review of music therapy (Koger and colleagues).
