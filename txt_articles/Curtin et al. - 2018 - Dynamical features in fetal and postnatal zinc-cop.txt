Metals are critical to neurodevelopment, and dysregulation in early life has been documented in autism
spectrum disorder (ASD). However, underlying mechanisms and biochemical assays to distinguish ASD cases
from controls remain elusive. In a nationwide study of twins in Sweden, we tested whether zinc-copper cycles,
which regulate metal metabolism, are disrupted in ASD. Using novel tooth-matrix biomarkers that provide direct
measures of fetal elemental uptake, we developed a predictive model to distinguish participants who would be
diagnosed with ASD in childhood from those who did not develop the disorder. We replicated our findings in three
independent studies in the United States and the UK. We show that three quantifiable characteristics of fetal and
postnatal zinc-copper rhythmicity are altered in ASD: the average duration of zinc-copper cycles, regularity with
which the cycles recur, and the number of complex features within a cycle. In all independent study sets and in the
pooled analysis, zinc-copper rhythmicity was disrupted in ASD cases. In contrast to controls, in ASD cases, the cycle
duration was shorter (F = 52.25, P < 0.001), regularity was reduced (F = 47.99, P < 0.001), and complexity diminished
(F = 57.30, P < 0.001). With two distinct classification models that used metal rhythmicity data, we achieved 90%
accuracy in classifying cases and controls, with sensitivity to ASD diagnosis ranging from 85 to 100% and specificity
ranging from 90 to 100%. These findings suggest that altered zinc-copper rhythmicity precedes the emergence of
ASD, and quantitative biochemical measures of metal rhythmicity distinguish ASD cases from controls.
INTRODUCTION
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects 1 to 2% of the population in
developed countries. Reports have shown that multiple nutrient
elements and toxic metals are differentially absorbed and metabolized
in children with ASD (1–3). However, the mechanisms underlying el-
emental dysregulation and ASD risk are not well understood, and it is
not known whether this elemental dysregulation is present in fetal and
early postnatal life before first clinical symptoms manifest.
Here, we tested whether zinc-copper pathways were disrupted
in ASD and whether quantitative measures of zinc-copper dynamics
could provide a biochemical basis to distinguish ASD cases from
controls. We selected zinc-copper cycles as our primary target for test-
ing the dysregulation hypothesis because these are highly conserved in
evolution, are essential for maintenance of health, and also exert ho-
meostatic control over known neurotoxicants (4). Notable examples
of disorders arising from perturbations of the metabolism of these
metals include Wilson’s disease, a key component of which is copper
dysregulation that leads to progressive neurological and cognitive
dysfunction and psychosis-like symptoms also documented in adults
with ASD (5). In Wilson’s disease, realigning the zinc-copper inter-
action via zinc supplementation increases the expression of the metal-
binding protein metallothionein, which helps regulate copper levels (6).
Recently, zinc-associated pathways have been implicated in ASD (4, 7, 8).
Forexample, mutations in the gene coding forSHANK3, whichispartof
a zinc-mediated signaling system, are linked to increased ASD risk (9).
Many physiologic processes follow cyclic patterns or rhythms that
operate at a wide range of time intervals, from milliseconds (for exam-
ple, neuron firing) to hours (for example, body temperature), days or
circadian (for example, sleep cycles), weeks, or longer (for example,
menstrual cycles) (10, 11). For any system in the body, multiple cycles
operating at different timescales may interact, and the study of these
processes requires methods that focus not solely on concentration but
rather on the dynamic changes over time (12, 13). Zinc and copper
levels are not stationary in the human body, exhibiting a cyclic pattern
(14–16). We therefore focused on their cyclic properties rather than
single-point measures of serum concentrations. We use the term cycles
to indicate time-dependent rhythmic variation in the concentration of

 elements. Our methodology samples elemental concentrations in in-
cremental zones of teeth (akin to growth rings in trees) at approximately
2- to 3-day intervals, which allows for the identification of cyclical pro-
cesses varying at an approximately 7- to 10-day period. Contrasting
these cycles between ASD cases and controls offers a way to uncover
system-wide dysregulations in zinc-copper rhythmicity. Furthermore,
because zinc and copper pathways are central regulators of multiple
metals, their disruption would have downstream effects, including
incomplete metabolism of other essential elements and toxic metals
(17, 18). Therefore, we also studied the metabolic cycles of other metals
during the fetal and early childhood periods (from the second trimester
to approximately 1 year of age) (19, 20). To test our hypothesis, we ap-
plied the tooth biomarkers in four case-control samples: a discovery
population of twins from Sweden and replication in two U.S. case-
control samples and a birth cohort from the UK.
RESULTS
Dysregulation of zinc-copper cycles in ASD
Our primary hypothesis predicts dysregulation of zinc-copper cycles
in ASD, as quantified by cycle duration, complexity, and regularity.
The mean diagonal length (MDL) measures the duration of a cycle and
was used in our study to detect fragmentation of zinc-copper cycles (see
Fig. 1andSupplementary Materials and Methods). We foundthat MDL

 for zinc-copper cycles was significantly reduced across all cohorts (F =
52.25, P < 0.001), reflecting an average reduction of 15% in ASD twins
(Fig. 2A). We also detected a significant ASD × study interaction (F =
3.83, P = 0.014), reflecting some across-study variability in the mag-
nitude of ASD-related reductions, but post hoc tests confirmed signif-
icantly reduced MDL in ASD cases in all populations studied (Sweden,
F = 38.05, P < 0.001; New York, USA, F = 8.07, P = 0.029; Texas, USA,
F = 12.41, P = 0.005; UK, F = 8.57, P = 0.023). For additional details,
see table S1.
Zinc-copper cycles in ASD cases also exhibited significantly reduced
entropy (a measure of biochemical network complexity),in contrast to
non-ASD controls who had more complex cycles (F = 57.3, P < 0.001;
Fig. 2B). After correction for multiple comparisons, we found no ev-
idence that this effect varied across populations; that is, the attenuation
of entropy in ASD cases was consistent across studies.
Finally, we found that determinism, a measure of cycle regularity
and resistance to perturbation, was significantly reduced in ASD pa-
tients (F = 47.99, P < 0.001; Fig. 2C). As with entropy, we found that
the ASD-related attenuation of determinism was consistent across
populations.
Accuracy of elemental dynamics for classifying ASD
Given the significant differences we observed between ASD cases and
neurotypically developing controls across multiple dynamical features
of elemental cycles, we implemented an ensemble machine learning
classification method generalized from weighted quantile sum (WQS)
regression (21) to gauge how the full range of cyclical features classifies
subjects as ASD cases or controls independently of their population of
origin. Using optimal threshold criteria, this model was 90% accurate in
predicting ASD cases, with 100% sensitivity for ASD diagnosis and 85%
specificity to controls. Figure 3A showsthe classification performance of
this model, as applied to the holdout data set (15% of data). To confirm
that robust classification could be achieved independently of the predic-
tive algorithm applied, we also implemented an alternative approach
based on penalized logistic regression [least absolute shrinkage and se-
lection operator (LASSO)]. This approach achieved similar overall model
accuracy (90%; model performance summarized in Fig. 3B), with slightly
less sensitivity but improved specificity. Model performance relative to
WQS is summarized in Fig. 3C; additional details on the construction of
classification algorithms are presented in the Supplementary Materials.
DISCUSSION
We tested the hypothesis that disruption of zinc-copper dynamics un-
derlies the elemental dysregulation that has been observed in ASD (1–3).
We used tooth-matrix biomarkers to measure detailed temporal profiles
of zinc, copper, and other elements from the second trimester to approx-
imately 1 year postnatally. To characterize the coprogression of zinc and
coppercyclesthroughoutearlydevelopment,weusedcross-RQA(CRQA),
amathematicalapproachthatoriginatesindynamical systems theory. We
identified cycles varying on an approximately 10-day period and found
strong evidence for abnormalities in zinc-copper cycles in ASD char-
acterized by shorter duration, lower complexity, and less determinism.
Further, we found that the integration of these dynamical features in an
ensemble machine-learning algorithm allowed for a robust classification
of ASD cases and controls, which we were able to replicate with sim-
ilar accuracy with an alternative predictive algorithm based on penal-
ized logistic regression. Together, these findings suggest that the
normally well-coordinated and intricate metabolism of these essential
elements is fragmented in ASD.
Metals have long been implicated in autism(1–3). Early life exposure
to toxic metals and deficiencies of nutritional elements have been linked
with several adverse developmental outcomes frequently associated with
ASD, including intellectual disability and language, attentional, and
behavioral problems (7). Animal studies show that the effects of various
metals on brain development could be mediated through dysregulation
in neurotransmission and alterations in frontal and subcortical brain
structures (8), which have also been implicated in ASD (9). Here, we
found that measures of metal rhythmicity, but not metal concentra-
tion, were associated with ASD. These data emphasize that the dys-
functions apparent in cyclical properties are not evident in raw
measures of concentration, which highlights the utility of our approach.
This does not suggest that elemental concentrations are not relevant to
the etiology of ASD, as we have previously published findings linking
elevated levels of several elements (1). However, that study dealt exclu-
sively with a twin sample; without the inherent control of genetic and
environmental confounds in nontwins, those differences in elemental
concentrations may not be apparent.
Dynamic rhythms are central to human health and disease and have
been reported in many systems (12, 13). Notably, much research has

 been carried out on imprints of rhythms in mammalian teeth (22, 23),
making naturally shed deciduous human teeth an ideal biomatrix to
study the role of metal rhythmicity and its disruption in childhood
disorders, as we have carried out here for ASD. A key feature of our
approach is the focus on dynamic rhythms in the internal metabolism
of essential elements and toxic metals, rather than solely relying on an
exposure paradigm that emphasizes external environmental exposures.
By doing so, we could identify disrupted zinc-copper (and zinc-lead)
cycles, even in populations where exposures were not excessive. In con-
trast to previous studies that have used blood or urinary biomarkers to
investigate cyclical elemental dynamics in humans over periods less
than a week, our methods allowed for a longitudinal analysis over a
prolonged developmental period extending from the second trimester
to approximately 1 year of age. An important consideration is that these
differences in the developmental periods studied and temporal resolu-
tion between our study and those using repeated blood or urine mea-
surements do not imply that the underlying processes being observed
are dissimilar or unrelated; rather, we suggest that the cyclical processes
we capture are superimposed on daily oscillations that have been pre-
viously described (14, 15). Independent of the duration of the cycles
studied, we consistently found dysregulated cycle complexity and reg-
ularity in ASD cases across multiple replication samples, which bolsters
our results against random measurement errors, and served as the basis
of our classification analysis.
Critically, the focus on elemental dynamics represents a novel theo-
retical perspective in the consideration of factors predictive of ASD.
While the role of elemental exposures in ASD is well studied, previous
investigations have considered primarily the role of exposure intensities,
that is, biomarker concentrations. Our results provide a new perspec-
tive, in that the temporal organization of elemental assimilation, as well
as the interaction of multiple elemental pathways, appears critical to the
emergence of ASD. This theoretical perspective, which we refer to as
systemic elemental dysregulation (SED), opens new avenues for in-
vestigating elemental dysregulation in ASD and other disorders and
yieldstestablehypothesesforfutureinvestigationstopursue.Forexample,
our finding of dysregulated zinc-copper rhythmicity suggests underlying
dysregulation in mechanisms involved in zinc-copper metabolism, which
will be pursued in future studies with in vivo animal models and in vitro–
induced pluripotent stem cells, where experimental manipulation of
zinc-copper dynamics is possible. Consistent with this, a recent study (3)
identified zinc deficiency and attenuated zinc transporter expression in
humans with autism-related mutations in the SHANK3 gene, consistent
withthe SEDetiological perspective of dysregulated metabolic processes
(3). In addition, our results emphasize the need to investigate other dis-
eases where elemental assimilation is known to play a role, such as, at-
tention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which, to date, has been
primarily studied through the lens of exposure intensity.
We also studied other elements because disruption of zinc and cop-
per cycles may have downstream effects, including incomplete metab-
olism of other elements and toxic metals (17, 18). While we did not
directly test biochemical pathways underlying interactions between
zinc, copper, and other elements, we observed alteration in the joint
rhythmicity of zinc and lead characterized by smaller and less complex
cycles (fig. S1). Shorter and lower entropy interactions suggest that the
regulatory effect of zinc on toxic metals, which is generally perceived as
protective, is perturbed. We also found differences in other metals be-
tween cases and controls that were restricted to some, but not to all, study
samples (see tables S1 and S2). This may be due to population-specific
dynamics, such as differences in diet or exposure to pollution, which we
have not analyzed in depth here.
Strengths of this study include the use of recently developed and val-
idated methods to measure metals in teeth that provide detailed temporal

 profiles of elemental uptake during the fetal and early childhood periods.
The use of population-derived discovery cohorts and the fact that our
results could be replicated in ASD children from several geographical
regions further bolster the validity of our findings. Limitations include
small discovery and replication populations, but together, our sample
size is approximately 200 participants, which was sufficient to detect
and replicate significant elemental disruptions. Nonetheless, it is possi-
ble that other elements are also affected, which would only be detected
with larger sample sizes. Our laser-based sampling method did not
provide sufficient sampling points to separately study metal rhythmicity
during the prenatal period from that observed after birth. Given that
metal metabolism processes can incorporate toxic elements with similar
chemical properties (cadmium and mercury, among others), the dysre-
gulatory mechanism described herein may also play a role in their well-
described neurotoxicity. Furthermore, other neuroactive metal regulatory
pathways, such as iron and manganese, deserve to be studied as well.
In conclusion, in a discovery set of twins, including monozygotic
twins discordant for ASD and three independent replication population
samples, zinc-copper cycles were consistently altered in ASD. Further-
more, quantitative biochemical measures of the joint cyclic properties of
zinc and copper accurately distinguished ASD cases from controls.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study participants
Our participants were recruited from four different studies being under-
taken in three countries. Ethics clearances were obtained from the rele-
vant institutional review boards at the coordinating site of each study.
Key characteristics of the studies are outlined in Table 1, and details of
participant recruitment and ASD case ascertainment are provided in
Supplementary Materials and Methods. Briefly, a discovery analysis
was undertaken in the Roots of Autism and ADHD Twin Study in
Sweden (RATSS), which is designed to investigate the genetic and
environmental determinants of ASD. Twins were recruited from nation-
wide registries and by advertisements in Sweden (24). From the whole
RATSS cohort, we collected and analyzed teeth from 75 participants
(32 complete twin pairs and 11 individuals from twin pairs whose sibling
did not donate a tooth). This subsample constituted 26% of the RATSS
cohort and 50% of all participants in RATSS of tooth-shedding age.
For our primary replication analysis, we obtained teeth and support-
ing data from 25 ASD cases and 25 gender-matched controls enrolled
in a long-term pregnancy cohort in the UK—the Avon Longitudinal
Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) (25). We undertook additional
replication analysis by including ASD-diagnosed individuals (n = 10) at
an autism clinic in New York, USA and their unaffected siblings (n = 8)
(26). Finally, we enrolled a random sample of 25 cases and 25 controls
from a community-based study in Texas, USA—the Autism Tooth Fairy
Project—that collects teeth and supporting data from parents through a
community network (27).
Laboratory assessments
Details of tooth collection protocols of each study population are
provided in the Supplementary Materials. Our approach to measure
metals in teeth using LA-ICPMS and assign developmental times was
detailed elsewhere (20, 28). Briefly, teeth were sectioned, and the neo-
natal line (a histological feature formed in enamel and dentin at the
time of birth) and incremental markings were used to assign temporal
information to sampling points. A New Wave Research NWR-193 (ESI)
laser ablation unit equipped with a 193-nm ArF excimer laser was
connected to an Agilent Technologies 8800 triple-quadrupole ICPMS
(Agilent Technologies). Helium was used as a carrier gas from the
laser ablation cell and mixed with argon via Y-piece before introduc-
tion to the ICPMS. The system was tuned daily using NIST SRM 612
(trace elements in glass) to monitor sensitivity (maximum analyte ion
counts), oxide formation (232Th16O+/232Th+, <0.3%), and fractiona-
tion (232Th+/238U+, 100 ± 5%). The laser was scanned in dentin parallel
to the dentinoenameljunction from the dentin horn tip toward the tooth
cervix.Apreablation scan wasrun to removeany surface contamination.
Data were analyzed as metal-to-calcium ratios (for example, 208Pb/
43Ca) to control for any variations in the mineral content within a
tooth and between samples. On average, each tooth was sampled at
>150 locations. LA-ICPMS operating parameters are given in table S3.
Statistical analyses
Traditional statistical approaches to uncover the association of envi-
ronmental stressors and disease outcomes, such as regression modeling,
use concentrations at given time points as the fundamental units of
analysisbutdo notresolvethe dynamiccyclicalnature of environmental
exposures and their metabolism. To overcome this limitation, we used
RQA and CRQA, which are nonlinear analytical methods for studying
cyclical signal properties. These methods are well characterized with
applications in diverse scientific fields, including physiology, molecular
biology, geophysical sciences, and psychology [see reviews by Webber
and colleagues (29, 30) and Marwan et al. (31)]. The methods applied
here, summarized in fig. S2, are described at length in Curtin et al. (32)
and were implemented via the Cross-Recurrence Toolbox v5.16 (33) in
MATLAB v2016b (MathWorks). Briefly, for RQA, time-series metal
data from deciduous teeth were first used to construct RPs, with delay
(t) and embedding dimension (m) parameters calculated by the mini-
mization of mutual information and false-nearest-neighbors algo-
rithms, respectively (fig. S2). To facilitate cross-subject comparisons,
threshold functions, e, were constrained to fix signal recurrence rates

 to 10%. The temporal organization of features in the resulting RPs was
then quantified via RQA to yield measures of MDL, recurrence time
(RT), determinism, and entropy. These measures capture different
features of diagonal line structures in RPs, which reflect cyclical signal
components. MDL quantifies the average duration of these cycles, while
RT measures the average interval between cycles. Determinism com-
pares the ratio of cyclical to noncyclical recurrence points and is there-
fore a unit-less metric akin to a percentage, while entropy, a unit-less
metric of predictability, measures the variability in cyclical lengths to
capture the complexity of periodic signatures. For CRQA, these methods
are extended to cross-recurrence plots, which capture the temporal or-
ganization of two-signal cyclical interactions over time (29–31).
Before inferential statistical tests, all variables were evaluated to con-
firm assumptions of normality in variable distributions. For analyses
of recurrence features (RQA/CRQA), linear mixed models were used
to test main effects of ASD diagnosis on features while also testing for
potential interactions of ASD diagnosis and study population to evalu-
ate population-specific effects. Familial relationships among subjects,
including siblings and twins, were modeled as random variables to ac-
count for nonindependence of twins and siblings while also controlling
for sex as a covariate. Additional covariates, including zygosity, gesta-
tional age, birth weight, and diagnosed comorbidities, including ADHD
and intellectual disability, were also initially modeled, but these were
ultimately excluded as they caused only negligible adjustments in
our primary predictors and had no significant associations with out-
comes. P values for study-specific differences reflect post hoc analyses
of ASD × study interactions with Bonferroni adjustments for multiple
comparisons. P values describing differences in the overall pool of
subjects reflect the main effects of ASD diagnosis with false discovery
rate P value adjustments.
Two classification models were undertaken: a generalization of
WQS regression (21) to a binomial distribution to create a logistic clas-
sification algorithm or the application of penalized logistic regression
(LASSO) (34). Briefly, for WQS, data from all study populations were
pooled and then divided into training (34% of sample size), validation
(51%), and holdout (15%) subsets. The training data set was analyzed
via WQS regression, yielding an empirically weighted index character-
izing the mixture of recurrence variables, a b parameter estimating the
association of this weighted index with ASD diagnosis, and an index of
weights describing each individual variable’s contribution to the overall
index. Weights derived from the training set were then used to
construct and test a WQS index in the validation data set, and the
resulting b estimates for the index were used to calculate a regression
model for predicting outcomes in the holdout data set, which was en-
tirely naïve to estimation of either weights or regression parameters.
We randomly selected participants from all the populations for the clas-
sification analysis so that no single study population can drive the clas-
sification accuracy (or specificity or sensitivity) and significant features
would be predictive independently of population.
For predictive models based on penalized logistic regression, data
were initially randomly subset into training (85% of participants) and
holdout (15% of participants) data sets. As in the implementation of
WQS, all measures derived from RQA (MDL, entropy, determinism,
and RT) for all elemental pathways and cross-recurrences studied were
included in model building. Tenfold cross-validation was then applied
in the training data set to identify a model with minimal deviance. The
optimal LASSO model was then used to predict case/control status in
the naïve holdout data set. Additional details on model formulation and
implementation are provided in the Supplementary Materials.
In evaluating the performance of predictive classifiers, sensitivity
was calculated as true-positive predictions/number of positive cases,
specificitywascalculatedastrue-negativepredictions/numberofnegative
cases, and accuracy was calculated as the number of correct predictions/
numberof totalpredictions.Weconfirmedthe suitabilityof undertaking
a pooled analysis by establishing the equivalence of the control subjects
across the four study populations (see fig. S3 and the “Bioequivalence
testing” section in the Supplementary Materials).
