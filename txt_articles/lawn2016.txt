investigator group*
An estimated 2·6 million third trimester stillbirths occurred in 2015 (uncertainty range 2·4–3·0 million). The 
number of stillbirths has reduced more slowly than has maternal mortality or mortality in children younger than 
5 years, which were explicitly targeted in the Millennium Development Goals. The Every Newborn Action Plan 
has the target of 12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 births in every country by 2030. 94 mainly high-income countries 
and upper middle-income countries have already met this target, although with noticeable disparities. At least 
56 countries, particularly in Africa and in areas aff
 ected by confl
 ict, will have to more than double present 
progress to reach this target. Most (98%) stillbirths are in low-income and middle-income countries. Improved 
care at birth is essential to prevent 1·3 million (uncertainty range 1·2–1·6 million) intrapartum stillbirths, end 
preventable maternal and neonatal deaths, and improve child development. Estimates for stillbirth causation are 
impeded by various classifi
 cation systems, but for 18 countries with reliable data, congenital abnormalities 
account for a median of only 7·4% of stillbirths. Many disorders associated with stillbirths are potentially 
modifi
 able and often coexist, such as maternal infections (population attributable fraction: malaria 8·0% and 
syphilis 7·7%), non-communicable diseases, nutrition and lifestyle factors (each about 10%), and maternal age 
older than 35 years (6·7%). Prolonged pregnancies contribute to 14·0% of stillbirths. Causal pathways for 
stillbirth frequently involve impaired placental function, either with fetal growth restriction or preterm labour, or 
both. Two-thirds of newborns have their births registered. However, less than 5% of neonatal deaths and even fewer 
stillbirths have death registration. Records and registrations of all births, stillbirths, neonatal, and maternal deaths 
in a health facility would substantially increase data availability. Improved data alone will not save lives 
but provide a way to target interventions to reach more than 7000 women every day worldwide who experience 
the reality of stillbirth.
Introduction
The Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) showed 
the value of health outcome targets to drive change. 
Maternal mortality (MDG 5) and mortality in children 
younger than 5 years (MDG 4) have been halved, with 
progress still accelerating, most notably for mortality in 
children younger than 5 years, with the average annual 
rate of reduction (ARR) improving from 1·2% 
(1990–1995) to 4% (2005–2013).1 The world’s 2·7 million 
neonatal deaths (classed as death within fi
 rst 28 days 
after birth) have increased in prominence in national 
and global agendas, mainly because these deaths 
account for 45% of the deaths of children under 5 years 
worldwide.1 Attention was not driven by millions of 
newborn deaths, but by recognition that neonatal 
mortality, accounted for almost half of deaths in 
children younger than 5 years and hence was essential 
for progress towards MDG 4.2,3 By contrast, stillbirths 
(panel 1 for defi
 nitions) were not included in the MDGs 
and are not tracked by either the UN or the Global 
Burden of Disease,7 both of which count burden only 
after a livebirth.1,8 Despite previous estimates showing 
large numbers of stillbirths (2·6 million [uncertainty 
range 2·1–3·8 million] in 2009),9 global attention for 
this issue is low. Analyses of development aid show 
how rarely stillbirths were mentioned by donors—only 
four times in more than 2 million disbursements 
totalling US$1599 billion (constant 2013 US dollar) 
from 2002–13.10,11
The mortality focus during the MDG era (from 2000 to 
2015) has also stimulated investments in data 
improvement. For example, child mortality data have 
increased through nationally representative surveys, the 
largest source for mortality data in children younger 
than 5 years in low-income and lower middle-income 
countries. 
Many 
middle-income 
countries 
have 
strengthened reporting of child death in routine systems, 
including vital registration. The frequency and visibility 
of estimates for maternal, children younger than 5 years, 
and neonatal mortality have increased, with inclusion of 
neonatal mortality into annual UNICEF reports since 
2011.12 By contrast, stillbirth rate (SBR) data, although 
available in more than 100 countries through civil 
registration and vital statistics systems or registry data, 
have not been routinely collated. Nor has investment 
been made to improve stillbirth data through household 
surveys, which are the main SBR data source for most 
high burden countries. So far, only one set of national 
SBR estimates has been undertaken with WHO.9 Hence, 
stillbirths have been without a high profi
 le target 
or accountability loop, as emphasised in several 
MDG reports.13–15

The Every Newborn Action Plan (ENAP) launched in 
mid-2014 with a World Health Assembly resolution, 
endorsed by all countries and supported by more than 
80 partners,16 supports the UN Secretary General’s 
global initiative of Every Woman Every Child, linking 
with Ending Preventable Maternal Mortality17 and A 
Promise Renewed for children. During consultations 
for 
ENAP 
development, 
country 
representatives 
repeatedly stated that a target for stillbirths was needed 
to ensure accountability.3,16 Analyses for targets to end 
preventable neonatal deaths and stillbirths in every 
country by 2030 are outlined in the Lancet Every 
Newborn Series.3,16
Objectives
This Series paper reviews the status of stillbirths 
worldwide and the progress since the Lancet Stillbirths 
Series in 2011.7 We have undertaken new analyses with 
the aim of informing action to meet the ENAP target of 
12 or fewer stillbirths per 1000 total births in all countries 
by 2030. These analyses include: (1) Progress and 
projections for SBRs in 195 countries with new estimates 
and trends from 2000 to 2015 to evaluate national SBR 
reductions needed to reach 2030 stillbirth targets. (2) 
Identifi
 cation of priority action areas to accelerate 
progress towards the prevention of stillbirths, notably 
where and when to focus attention, including the fi

Key messages
What is happening to stillbirth rates?
At the end of the Millennium Development Goal era, 
2·6 million (uncertainty range 2·4–3·0 million) third trimester 
stillbirths occurred annually. Stillbirth rates have declined 
more slowly since 2000 than either maternal mortality or 
mortality in children younger than 5 years. Better data are 
essential to accelerate progress towards the target of 12 or 
fewer stillbirths per 1000 births in every country by 2030.
Where geographically to focus attention?
Ten countries account for two-thirds of stillbirths and most 
neonatal (62%) and maternal (58%) deaths estimated in 
2015. 56 countries, many of these in Africa, need to at least 
double present progress in the reduction of stillbirths. The 
highest stillbirth rates are in confl
 ict and emergency areas. 
About 60% of stillbirths are in rural areas. Marked disparities 
remain between and within countries.
When and where in the health system to focus attention?
In 2015, an estimated 1·3 million intrapartum stillbirths 
(deaths during labour) occurred, despite two-thirds of births 
worldwide now being in health facilities. High coverage of 
good quality care during labour and birth gives a quadruple 
return on investment by preventing maternal and neonatal 
deaths and also stillbirths and disability with improvements 
in child development. Improved quality of antenatal care and 
family planning are also important to maximise maternal and 
fetal wellbeing.
What to focus on to end preventable stillbirths?
The opinion that most stillbirths are inevitable is a myth. 
Congenital abnormalities account for a median of only 7·4% 
of all stillbirths, some of which are also preventable, notably 
neural tube defects. Modifiable disorders with the highest 
estimated population attributable fraction (PAF) at a global 
level include: maternal age of older than 35 years 
(PAF 6·7%), maternal infections (malaria 8·2% and syphilis 
7·7%), non-communicable diseases, nutrition and lifestyle 
factors, such as obesity (many of which coexist, each 
contributing to about 10%), and prolonged pregnancy 
(14·0%). 
Which priority data are required to accelerate progress 
towards 2030?
Two-thirds of the world’s newborns have a birth certifi
 cate 
but death and stillbirth certifi
 cate coverage is much lower, 
with many missed opportunities, especially in health 
facilities.  Ending preventable  stillbirths, as well as neonatal 
and maternal deaths, needs ambitious milestones and 
investment for data improvement, notably for counting 
births and deaths, tracking programme coverage and quality, 
and advancing accountability—eg, through audit.

Defi
 nitions
The International Classifi
 cation of Diseases (ICD) and 
WHO recommendations are now widely recognised 
and used for reporting of stillbirth rates (panel 1),18 
enabling 
comparisons 
between 
countries 
whilst 
recognising other defi
 nitions might be applied for 
internal use. Variability in defi
 nitions occurs mainly 
among the high-income countries with a range from 
20 weeks of gestational age and or more, with many 
countries reducing the gestational age for reporting 
because of the increasing survival at earlier gestational 
ages with neonatal intensive care.7,19
However, as more countries report stillbirth data, 
issues with respect to the application of the ICD stillbirth 
classifi
 cation are now clearer. The ICD was developed 
before reporting of gestational age became the standard 
and prioritises birthweight over gestational age, 
incorrectly assuming equivalence between birthweight 
and gestational age (panel 1).4 A cutoff
  based on 
gestational age is more appropriate, as a better predictor

3
of maturity and hence viability, than birthweight.20 We 
propose that for international comparison, the defi
 nition 
should focus on a gestational age threshold for stillbirths 
rather than birthweight and that this change be included 
in ICD 11. In this Series, we use the 28 weeks or more 
defi
 nition for epi demiological estimates of stillbirth.4
An intrapartum stillbirth is a stillbirth occurring after 
the onset of labour but before birth. Fresh appearance 
of the skin is often used as surrogate marker for 
intrapartum stillbirth (panel 1).21 Antepartum stillbirths 
occur before the onset of labour.
Data inputs and analyses
Panel 2 and the appendix summarise the data inputs 
and analyses. SBR data were available from 157 of 
195 countries, with high quality civil registration and 
vital statistics systems data from 45 countries.4 SBR 
estimates were developed with the UN including a 
presentation at a WHO meeting (February, 2015), at a 
meeting of the UN Inter-agency Group for Mortality 
Estimation (June, 2015),4 and through a WHO 
consultation process with national statistical offi
  ces.
Data for timing of stillbirths (antepartum or 
intrapartum) are not available for most countries, with 
130 having no useable data (panel 2, appendix). 
Although intrapartum SBR data should be available 
from most birth registers in health facilities, these data 
are infrequently collated at a national level, even in 
high-income countries. The analyses of causes, notably 
congenital 
abnormalities, 
and 
risk 
factors 
are 
summarised in panel 2, and the appendix.
Progress in the reduction of stillbirths and 
meeting 2030 targets
In 2015, an estimated 2·6 million babies (uncertainty 
range 2·4–3·0 million) died before birth during the 
last trimester of pregnancy, a worldwide rate of 
18·4 stillbirths per 1000 total births (uncertainty range 
16·7–21·0; fi
 gure 1A).4 In 2000, the estimated 
worldwide SBR was 24·7, implying an ARR of 2·0% 
between 2000 and 2015. Thus, although some progress 
has been made, this reduction has been slower than for 
maternal (ARR 3·0%), neonatal (3·1%), and post-
neonatal mortality of children younger than 5 years

• 
Early fetal death 500 g or more or 22 weeks or more or 
25 cm or more
• 
Miscarriage as a pregnancy loss before 22 completed weeks 
of gestational age
WHO defi
 nitions
For international comparison, WHO uses stillbirth to mean the 
ICD defi
 nitions of late fetal deaths (ie, birthweight of 1000 g or 
more with an assumed equivalent of 28 weeks gestation).
However, the birthweight and gestational age thresholds do 
not give equivalent results. For example in the USA, if 
stillbirths were defi
 ned by the birthweight of 500 g or more 
defi
 nition, the stillbirth rate is reduced by 40% compared with 
the defi
 nition of 22 weeks, and if the defi
 nition is a birthweight 
of 1000 g or more then the proportion of stillbirths is reduced 
by 21% compared with the defi
 nition of 28 weeks.4 Hence the 
defi
 nition should be based on only one parameter and we 
propose that a gestational age threshold is most appropriate 
because this factor is a better predictor of viability than 
birthweight and information about gestational age is more 
widely available than birthweight for many stillbirths. In many 
low-income and middle-income countries, gestational age is 
mainly based on the last menstrual period, and improvement 
to gestational age accuracy in these settings will need 
additional innovation but is more feasible than weighing all 
stillbirths at home.
For these stillbirth rate estimates, we use the 28 weeks or more 
defi
 nition, which represents third trimester stillbirths and 
hence undercounts the true burden if early stillbirths were 
included. We use the term stillbirth to refer to all early and late 
fetal deaths because the ICD and many countries do count 
early stillbirths, mostly from 22 weeks.
Intrapartum stillbirth
An intrapartum stillbirth is a death which occurs after the 
onset of labour but before birth. Diagnosis of intrapartum 
stillbirth needs confi
 rmation of the presence of a fetal heart 
rate at the onset of labour. In settings where fetal heart rate 
monitoring is not available, assessment of the skin 
appearance is frequently used to estimate the timing of the 
stillbirth. Signs of skin maceration begin at 6–12 h after fetal 
death and therefore a fresh appearance of the skin with no 
signs of maceration is judged as a surrogate measure for 
intrapartum stillbirth.5 However, this assessment might be 
unreliable and can underestimate intrapartum stillbirth, 
especially when fetal death during labour occurs at home, and 
delays in access to care are more than 6–12 h.6 The 
intrapartum or fresh stillbirth rate is a useful marker of 
stillbirths preventable through because of improved care 
during labour. For programmatic action, where possible, the 
intrapartum stillbirth rate should be calculated, excluding 
those with severe congenital abnormalities because antenatal 
diagnosis of these conditions will aff
 ect the level of 
intervention during labour.

Panel 2: Overview of data inputs and methods
Stillbirth rates
Inputs
Stillbirth rate (SBR) data were identifi
 ed through web-based 
searches of National Statistical Offi
  ce and Ministry of Health 
websites of all countries. For countries outside the developed 
Millennium Development Goal region, systematic searches 
were undertaken, covering the medical published literature 
and all Demographic and Reproductive Health Surveys. A 
Stillbirth Epidemiology Investigator Group was created, with 
calls for data distributed through relevant groups and email 
listserves and individual principal investigators approached.4 
Data were assessed with specifi
 ed inclusion criteria and were 
adjusted to the 28 week or more defi
 nition where required. 
157 countries in total contributed data. High quality civil 
registration and vital statistics data were available from 
45 countries, lower quality civil registration and vital statistics 
systems or health management information systems data from 
65 countries. Data were available from 127 retrospective 
household surveys from 57 countries (127 surveys). 
Additionally, 329 studies were included.
Stillbirth estimation
For 39 countries, with a complete time series of high quality 
national data from the country’s own reported rates, adjusted 
where necessary, data were smoothed with LOcally WEighted 
Scatter-plot Smoother (known as LOESS) regression to 
produce estimated trends for 2000–15. For 156 countries 
without high quality time-series civil registration and vital 
statistics systems data, a regression model using national 
predictor covariates was developed to predict national SBR. 
The fi
 nal model included ln(neonatal mortality rate), ln(gross 
national income), ln(low birthweight rate) mean years of 
adult female education, the context of the study, and the 
region as the main variables for prediction purposes. Details 
of the model and trend estimates are given in the 
accompanying methods paper.4
Projections to 2030 at national level were estimated on the 
basis of trends for SBR 2000–15, assuming the same national 
average annual rate of reduction, and combining with UN 
Population Division medium birth cohort projections by 
country and year. Annual rate of reduction is calculated with 
the formula: 
Uncertainty
We derived uncertainty estimates with a bootstrap approach 
by drawing 1000 bootstrap samples with replacement from 
the input data, rerunning the model to produce estimates, 
and taking the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile values for each 
cause as the uncertainty bounds. For countries with high 
quality time-series data, in which reported rates were used, 
we assumed a Poisson distribution.4
Intrapartum stillbirth rates
Inputs
Data on intrapartum stillbirths were identifi
 ed through 
web-based searches of National Statistical Offi
  ce and Ministry 
of Health websites and systematic literature searches for all 
countries. Further data were requested from the Stillbirth 
Epidemiology Investigator Group. Data were assessed using 
specifi
 ed inclusion/exclusion criteria. Where civil registration 
and vital statistics systems and routine data were available for 
more than 1 year, the latest full year of data availability was 
used. Data were included from 65 countries (41 outside the 
developed region as defi
 ned by the Millennium Development 
Goal regions; appendix). This included 173 datapoints 
covering over 37 million births with 1·1 million stillbirths.
Estimation
We attempted various strategies to fi
 t a regression model to 
estimate the national intrapartum stillbirth rate, including 
approaches to predict intrapartum stillbirth rate, the 
proportion of all stillbirths that are intrapartum, and the log 
odds of stillbirth (appendix). In view of limitations in the 
quantity and quality of available data, identifi
 cation of a 
satisfactory model was not possible. Therefore to estimate 
the intrapartum stillbirth rate for each country, we fi
 rst 
calculated the median proportion of stillbirths that are 
intrapartum from all data inputs from a certain region. We 
estimated the intrapartum stillbirth rate by applying the 
regional median proportion of stillbirths that are intrapartum 
to the country estimated stillbirth rate for 2015.
Uncertainty
We derived uncertainty estimates for the proportion of 
stillbirths that are intrapartum by the use of regional 
interquartile range for regions with more than ten data 
inputs. For regions with ten or fewer datapoints, we used the 
upper and lower datapoints. We simulated uncertainty 
estimates for intrapartum stillbirth rates with 1000 
independent random draws of the uncertainty around the 
total stillbirth estimated for the proportion of total stillbirths 
that were intrapartum.
Congenital disorders associated with stillbirth
Inputs
We undertook a web-based search of National Statistical 
Offi
  ce and Ministry of Health websites of all countries to 
identify databases and reports providing data for cause of 
death of stillbirths. National data were available from 
22 countries. We excluded data when countries reported with 
an early stillbirth defi
 nition (20 weeks or older, or 22 weeks or 
older) and included terminations of pregnancy or did not

(4·5%) over the same period.1,22 For every country to 
reach the ENAP stillbirth target of 12 or less by 2030 
(fi
 gure 1A),16 a global average ARR of 4·2% will be 
required from 2015, more than double the present ARR 
of 2·0%. Yet this worldwide average hides regional 
variation.
Despite slow progress overall, some countries within 
every region in fi
 gure 1B are reducing stillbirths faster 
than their neighbours. In Bangladesh, where the 
SBR ARR is 3·4%, the total fertility rate has halved 
since 2000 and coverage of key maternal–newborn 
interventions has increased over the same period, 
including at least four antenatal care visits (annual rate 
of change [ARC] 6·5%, regional median 3·1%) and 
birth with a skilled attendant (ARC 7·1%, regional 
median 2·9%).23 Births by caesarean section increased 
from less than 5% to 10–20% of all births, however 
reductions in the proportion of those non-medically 
indicated is crucial to maintain progress.23 Rwanda 
(SBR ARR 2·9%), although still with a high total 
fertility rate, has increased coverage of care (at least 
four antenatal care visits: ARC 3·8%, regional median 
2·5%) and skilled birth attendants (ARC 3·7%, regional 
median 2·0%). Similar improvements are noted in 
Cambodia, SBR ARR 3·6% (at least four antenatal care 
visits: ARC 8·5%, regional median 1·6%; skilled birth 
attendants: ARC 2·9%, regional median 0·6%). 
Nevertheless, two-thirds of women in Bangladesh and 
Rwanda still do not have access to at least four antenatal 
care visits and more than half of women in Bangladesh 
and a third of women in Rwanda and Cambodia give 
birth without a skilled attendant (appendix). In 2000, 
Peru, one of the fastest progressing countries in Latin 
America (SBR ARR 2·8%), had substantially lower 
coverage than its neighbouring countries but through 
strategic investment in maternal and newborn health, 
including national fi
 nancial protection, the country 
now has almost universal coverage of at least four 
antenatal care visits and skilled birth attendance.24 Even 
in high-income countries, such as the Netherlands, 
progress is possible with improvements in antenatal 
care and care at birth, a wide-scale perinatal audit, 
coupled with a focus on women’s health before and 
during pregnancy.19
(Continued from previous page)
provide consistent data on all stillbirths. For example, Italy 
had data for less than 50% of stillbirths and more than 25% 
were garbage codes (deaths assigned to ill-defi
 ned causes 
that are not compatible with the International Classifi
 cation 
of Diseases cause of death attribution); and the Philippines 
reported on only the top ten causes of stillbirth (which 
included 74% of all stillbirths). We abstracted data for the 
stillbirth defi
 nition used, the proportion of stillbirths with 
congenital abnormality given as the cause of death, and the 
proportion of stillbirths with no cause recorded. We extracted 
data for the present status of screening and the legal status of 
termination of pregnancy for congenital abnormalities from 
these reports and supplemented by web-based searches 
where necessary.
Risk factor analyses for stillbirth
Inputs
We reviewed the literature to identify potentially modifi
 able 
risk factors associated with stillbirths reported in the medical 
literature. We grouped these risk factors into the two 
categories: maternal (demographic and fertility related, 
infection, nutrition, lifestyle, non-communicable diseases, 
and environmental); and fetal (table 3). We included risk 
factors with strong evidence of an association with stillbirth 
and available prevalence data for all countries worldwide. We 
searched recent systematic reviews (published 2010–15) for 
data to inform the risk associations. We included studies with 
median data collection from 1995, restricting to more recent 
data where possible. We searched data for the population 
prevalence of the risk factor by country from publically 
available databases (appendix). For risk factors for stillbirth 
that were potentially modifi
 able and where prevalence data 
were available but with no risk association data from recent 
systematic reviews, we undertook new systematic reviews of 
the medical literature (appendix).
Estimation process
For included disorders, we calculated the proportion of cases 
in the whole population that might be attributed to the 
exposure to a risk (population attributable fraction [PAF]). 
PAF is the proportional reduction in stillbirth that would 
occur if exposure to a risk factor was reduced to an alternative 
ideal comparative scenario (ie, the counterfactual, such as no 
active syphilis in pregnancy). However, as stillbirths might be 
caused by various risk factors, and individual risk factors 
might interact in their eff
 ect on overall risk of stillbirth, PAFs 
for individual risk factors overlap. This calculation assumes 
causality and complete control of possible confounding 
factors and hence will probably overestimate the true PAF.
Uncertainty
We quantifi
 ed uncertainty around these estimates by taking 
1000 random draws of the national number of stillbirths and 
the risk associated with the disorder, and the prevalence of 
the risk factor (where available), assuming a normal 
distribution with mean equal to the point estimate of the 
parameter and the standard deviation equal to the estimated 
standard error. We summed these data at the regional level 
for each draw and present the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of 
the resulting distributions as the uncertainty range.
See the appendix for more details of inputs and methods.

Priorities for action to accelerate progress to 
prevent stillbirths
Where geographically to focus on to close the gap?
For many countries, accomplishment of the SBR target 
by 2030 will need concerted eff
 orts. At least 56 countries 
will need to more than double their present stillbirth 
ARR. In comparison, 30 countries need to double their 
ARR to reach the mortality target for children younger 
than 5 years and 42 countries to reach the neonatal 
mortality target.1 Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest 
SBRs and the slowest rates of progress  worldwide, 
especially in countries with confl
 icts and emergencies 
(fi
 gure 1B, appendix). Thus at the present rates of 
progress, over 160 years will pass before the average 
pregnant woman in sub-Saharan Africa has the same 
chance of her baby being born alive as does a woman 
nowadays in a high-income country (fi
 gure 1C), and 
even longer for women in the countries making the 
slowest progress, such as Zimbabwe. Although the 
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aim for 
convergence within a generation, with women and 
babies in all countries having the same chance of 
survival, equity gaps between regions and countries 
will widen over time unless present SBR trends change. 
This pattern is true even for high-income countries, 
which have an average SBR of 3·4 per 1000 total births 
but with substantial variation between countries, from 
1·3 (Finland) to 8·8 (Ukraine).
Almost all stillbirths occur in low-income and middle-
income countries (98%) with three-quarters in sub-
Saharan Africa and south Asia (fi
 gure 2). The ten 
countries with the most stillbirths worldwide account 
for 53% of all livebirths, 65% of all stillbirths, 58% of 
maternal deaths, and 62% neonatal deaths (table 1).4,22 
Population size is an important factor, but the rankings 
of countries with the most stillbirths also shift with 
changes in mortality risk and fertility. For example, 
Brazil no longer ranks in the ten countries with highest 
neonatal deaths and stillbirths, this progress has been 
achieved through dramatic falls in fertility and risk of 
stillbirth. By contrast, several sub-Saharan African 
countries with continuing high fertility and SBRs are 
now among the ten countries with the most stillbirths, 
notably Tanzania and Niger. Tanzania met MDG 4 for

See appendix and Blencowe and colleagues4 for details of stillbirth rate estimates. *Based on urban and rural birth cohorts with national stillbirth rates so the values 
might underestimate rural stillbirth rates, which are expected to be higher than urban rates. Facility and home stillbirth rates are diff
 erential, the direction of 
increased stillbirth rates is unpredictable because the values might be lower at home if high-risk cases are in facilities, or higher at home if very low access to care.

reducing mortality in children younger than 5 years but 
reductions in maternal and neonatal mortality, and 
especially stillbirths, have been slower.25 Challenging 
the myth that SBR or neonatal mortality rate reduction 
results in population growth, in many countries, the 
reductions in neonatal mortality rate and SBR coincided 
with a substantial reduction in fertility levels, including 
Cuba and Bangladesh (appendix).26
When to focus?
We estimate that worldwide in 2015, about half of 
stillbirths, 1·3 million (range 1·2–1·6 million), occurred 
during labour (fi
 gure 2). The proportion of stillbirths 
that are intrapartum varies from 10·0% (range 
5·5–18·4%) in developed regions to 59·3% (range 
32·0–84·0%) in south Asia (appendix). Most intra-
partum stillbirths occur in countries with low coverage 
of timely, high quality care around the time of birth. 
More than 40 million women give birth unattended at 
home each year. Improvements in access to high quality 
intrapartum care are essential for the reduction of 
preventable stillbirths, with the added benefi
 ts of a 
reduction in the 46% of maternal deaths during labour 
and 1 million neonatal deaths occurring on the day of 
birth, a reduction in long-term disability for the woman 
and child, as well as an enhancement in child 
development.3
Where in the health system?
Two-thirds of births worldwide occur in health 
facilities.27 Hence high quality facility care along with 
investments, including community demand and birth 
planning, should be the fi
 rst focus for stillbirth 
prevention. Despite increasing urbanisation with most 
of the world now residing in cities, in south Asia and 
especially in sub-Saharan Africa, about 60% of 
stillbirths are still rural (fi
 gure 2). Rural families are 
often the poorest people, with restricted access to 
midwifery 
care, 
family 
planning 
services, 
and 
emergency obstetric care, including caesarean section, 
resulting in high birth rates and high risk of stillbirth.23 
Additionally, SBR can be higher for rural areas in high-
income countries.28 Even short delays in access to 
appropriate care can result in death or disability for 
newborns and women.29,30 The three delays model 
developed for maternal deaths is relevant for stillbirths, 
including delays in: danger sign recognition; care-
seeking due to social or economic barriers, or distance 
and lack of transport; and receiving high quality health 
facility care.25 Intrapartum stillbirth is a sensitive 
marker of delay and low quality of care, refl
 ecting 
scarcity of intrapartum monitoring and delays in the 
rapid delivery of a compromised fetus. Much debate 
exists as to whether these factors, whilst averting the 
intrapartum stillbirth, could result in a compromised 
neonate with neonatal encephalopathy and potential 
long-term associated disability. Disability is less likely 
when timely action is taken and high quality neonatal 
care is available. However, tracking of these longer 
term outcomes is needed as intrapartum and neonatal 
intensive care are scaled up.31 Additionally, a woman 
who has a stillbirth is at risk of an obstetric fi
 stula or 
death. An estimated 78–96% of women with obstetric 
fi
 stula also have had a stillbirth.32,33
National SBRs show a strong ecological association 
with coverage of care (appendix). Higher national 
coverage of antenatal care is strongly associated with 
lower antepartum SBRs (appendix). Although WHO

recommends a four-visit antenatal care model for 
low-risk populations, these policies are being reviewed.34 
Similarly, higher coverage of birth with a skilled 
attendant is strongly associated with lower intrapartum 
SBRs. The median intrapartum SBR is high for those 
countries with caesarean section rates below 10% 
(appendix). In countries with caesarean section rates of 
more than 10%, a strong correlation with SBR does not 
seem to exist (appendix). This fi
 nding is consistent with 
a systematic review35 that failed to detect any 
improvement in maternal or newborn health with 
caesarean section rates of more than 10–15%.35,36 In 
countries with higher caesarean section rates, some 
caesareans might be inappropriate, contributing to 
higher preterm birth rates37 and are associated with an 
increased risk in subsequent pregnancies for mothers 
and an increased risk of mortality and morbidity for 
these 
off
 spring.38–40 
Policies 
should 
encourage 
appropriate caesarean sections but more research is 
needed to track and disincentivise non-medically 
indicated intervention.41 In low-income and middle-
income countries, much of the caesarean section 
epidemic is in the private sector, with rates of more 
than 50% in private hospitals, many of which are not 
medically indicated.23 However, the global challenge is 
that the women who most need caesarean sections to 
save their own or their babies’ lives are least likely to get 
them.42 In many poor communities, even if women are 
able to access emergency caesarean sections if needed, 
they might not get them in time and frequently have to 
pay for them out-of-pocket.42
Why do stillbirths occur?
Many countries, particularly high-income countries 
and middle-income countries, collate data for disorders 
associated with stillbirths. However, in view of the 
more than 55 active classifi
 cation systems, consistent 
estimation of stillbirth causation is diffi
  cult even across 
high-income countries.10,43 In the 2011 Lancet Stillbirths 
Series, we called for a simplifi
 ed classifi
 cation system 
that could be applied in low-income countries onto 
which more detailed categories recorded in other 
settings could be mapped.7 Since 2005, national 
estimates have been available for all UN member states 
for neonatal cause of death,43,44 but the absence of 
similar information for stillbirths restricts our ability to

inform programmatic action. Even if a new classifi
 cation 
system is agreed, a time lag of potentially up to a decade 
is possible before comparable national estimates for the 
major disorders associated with stillbirth are realised.
Congenital abnormalities are reported more  con-
sistently across many stillbirth classifi
 cation systems. 
Myths persist that stillbirths are inevitable and mostly 
due to non-preventable congenital abnormalities. Yet in 
most 
national 
reports, 
congenital 
abnormalities 
account for less than 10% all stillbirths after 22 weeks 
of gestation, with a median of 7·4% and a median rate 
of 0·4 per 1000 births (table 2). In settings with 
restricted diagnostics, low ascertainment of congenital 
causes is likely, for example in non-tertiary hospitals in 
South Africa (2·5%). Conversely with good diagnostics 
and where termination of pregnancy is illegal, a higher 
proportion of congenital abnormalities is reported (eg, 
21% in Ireland). Furthermore, not all congenital 
abnormalities are inevitable, for example most neural 
tube 
defects 
are 
preventable 
with 
folic 
acid 
supplementation or fortifi
 cation.
Babies at greatest risk of death
Male babies are at a 10% higher risk of stillbirth than 
female babies.45 The probable mechanisms include 
X-linked congenital conditions, increased risk of preterm 
labour, and poor fetal growth for male babies. The latter 
two disorders might be related to a higher incidence of 
placental vascular conditions, including pre-eclampsia.46
The smallest babies, in terms of birthweight and 
gestational age are at the highest risk of death. About 
20 million livebirths are estimated to have low 
birthweight (<2500 g) worldwide, but this simplistic, 
dichotomous cutoff
  fails to diff
 erentiate between fetal 
growth restriction and preterm labour, or a combination 
of the two.47 A higher risk of both antepartum and 
intrapartum stillbirth exists for those babies with fetal 
growth restriction than those without. Stillbirths are 
often the result of a causal network in which an already 
compromised fetus is more susceptible to infection or 
hypoxic eff
 ects.48 For example, the risk of death is higher 
for those who have had a hypoxic injury against a 
background of fetal growth restriction and infection, and 
this risk applies for stillbirths and liveborn babies who 
die or develop neonatal encephalopathy.49
Where high quality obstetric and neonatal care is 
available, intrapartum stillbirth is now rare and hence 
most stillbirths are antepartum and many are associated 
with fetal growth restriction. In these settings, fetal 
growth restriction or placental disorders are more likely 
to be detected and the balance of risks might favour 
early induction or caesarean section, hence increasing 
the preterm birth rate.50 However, early detection of 
fetal growth restriction is still a challenge even in high-
income countries.19
Modifi
 able factors associated with stillbirth
We reviewed potential risk factors for stillbirths, 
including 38 maternal factors consisting of demo-
graphic, environmental, nutritional, and lifestyle 
factors, maternal infections and non-communicable 
diseases, and fetal factors (table 3). We did not include 
distal determinants of stillbirth such as poverty and 
inequity, which aff
 ect underlying maternal health and

access to quality care. Although these factors are very 
important, data were not available to quantify the risk. 
Fetal growth restriction and preterm labour are 
frequently a fi
 nal factor in the causal pathway leading to 
stillbirth; however, in this comparative risk factor 
analysis, we focus on the biological risks.
Risk ratio data were available for 12 potentially 
modifi
 able factors associated with stillbirth, with 
prevalence data available for all countries (fi
 gure 3, 
appendix). These risk factors are not mutually exclusive 
and many might coincide in the same woman so the 
sum of the population attributable risks exceeds 100%. 
However, comparison of categories with the greatest 
overall eff
 ect on stillbirth risk still provides a useful 
guide for programmatic priorities towards ending 
preventable stillbirths.
Worldwide, 6·7% (uncertainty 6·3–7·3%) of stillbirths 
are attributable to older maternal age (older than 
35 years). Adolescent pregnancy is also associated with 
increased risk, especially in those younger than 16 years.51 
We were unable to quantify this risk due to lack of robust 
age-specifi
 c risk data. However, because of a lower 
number of pregnancies in this group compared with 
women older than 35 years, the population attributable 
contribution to stillbirth is relatively small. Family 
planning programmes might not have a clear message 
with respect to pregnancy risks at older ages, notably 
subfertility, severe maternal morbidity or death, 
stillbirth, preterm birth, low birthweight, and neonatal 
death.52 Such messages must be coupled with access to 
methods of family planning that are acceptable to the 
woman and with empower 
ment for informed choices.53 
Short interpregnancy interval is another important risk 
associated with other poor perinatal outcomes, modi-
fi
 able with family planning, but the eff
 ect on stillbirth is 
yet to be quantifi
 ed.54 
Infections 
during 
pregnancy 
are 
important 
preventable factors, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, 
although few studies report useable risk data. 
Improvements in prevention and treatment of malaria 
in pregnancy (estimated to be attributable for about 
20% of stillbirths in sub-Saharan Africa), and syphilis 
(7·7% [uncertainty range 4·6–12·0%] of stillbirths 
worldwide and 11·2% [6·8–17·3%] in sub-Saharan 
Africa), should be an important fi
 rst step to prevent 
stillbirths in weak health systems.55,56 Of note, the 
campaigns for management of malaria and syphilis in 
pregnant women have tended to focus on neonatal 
deaths, despite the much higher associated stillbirth 
burden. Data to assess the burden of stillbirths 
attributable to HIV and AIDS are scarce. On the basis 
of data from the South African Perinatal Problem 
Identifi
 cation Programme,57 we estimate that 0·7% 
(0·6–0·8% uncertainty range) of stillbirths in sub-
Saharan Africa might be attributable to HIV infection. 
The risk might be higher in settings without widespread 
availability of antiretroviral therapy (appendix).
The 
global 
epidemics 
of 
obesity 
and 
non-
communicable diseases, notably hypertension and 
diabetes, are aff
 ecting pregnancies in all regions,58 
especially when combined with advanced maternal age. 
Our estimates suggest that about 10% of stillbirths are 
attributable to these disorders (fi
 gure 3). Improvements 
to outcomes will need eff
 orts aimed at primary 
prevention and improved detection and management 
of aff
 ected women where possible before pregnancy. 
Tobacco has a relatively small population attributable 
risk (fi
 gure 3) due to a low increased risk of stillbirth 
compared with non-smokers and also a low prevalence 
of smoking, even in south Asia where smoking has 
risen dramatically over the past two decades.
More than 200 000 stillbirths are attributable to 
pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (combined fraction of 
population attributable risk 4·7%) with the highest 
burden in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. Many of 
these deaths could be averted with detection and 
appropriate management in antenatal care, and 
improved intrapartum care.59
Pregnancy lasting longer than 42 weeks is associated 
with an increased risk of stillbirth, accounting for an 
estimated 14·0% of stillbirths worldwide. Most 
high-income countries have introduced policies of 
induction of labour before 42 weeks, with some 
ecological analyses suggesting a substantial eff
 ect on 
the proportion of stillbirths.60 This policy could be 
extended to middle-income countries where accurate 
dating of pregnancies through early ultrasound, and 
emergency obstetric care, are widely available. Caution 
is needed in settings where these criteria cannot be 
met, especially for safe caesarean section, and a real 
potential exists for harm to women and their babies.42
For some other important factors, estimates of the 
attributable stillbirths were not possible because of a 
scarcity of prevalence or risk data (appendix). For 
example, with respect to violence against pregnant 
women, although studies show an increased risk of 
stillbirth61,62 and 30% of ever-partnered women 
experience physical or sexual abuse in their lifetime, no 
specifi
 c prevalence estimates are available for pregnant 
women.63 Other factors associated with an increased 
risk of stillbirth include: bacterial infections (eg, chorio-
amnionitis), viral infections (eg, infl
 uenza and 
hepatitis),64 other medical disorders (eg, thyroid 
disorders and liver disease),65 and indoor air pollution 
(30% increased risk).66,67
High quality antenatal care could identify and address 
many of these disorders. More than half of pregnant 
women are estimated to attend at least four antenatal 
care visits.68 However, optimisation of timing and 
quality of visits and attention to the marginalised, 
including those with mental health conditions, is 
essential.69,70
Although these biomedical disorders are important 
and must be addressed to improve fetal and maternal

13
health, especially in low-income and middle-income 
countries, the common factor underlying many 
stillbirths is the absence or low quality of intrapartum 
care, including access to timely referral.71,72 This 
situation must be urgently addressed. Progress in 
preventing of stillbirths will clearly need collaboration 
between groups who focus on issues beyond maternal 
and newborn care, notably family planning, non-
communicable diseases, nutrition, and malaria and 
other infections, as well as wider health systems 
change, 
strategies 
for 
women’s 
education 
and 
empowerment, and community engagement involving 
men, mothers in law, and other societal gatekeepers.
Counting stillbirths and making the data count
Some progress has been made in the measurement of 
stillbirths since the 2011 Lancet Stillbirths Series 
(appendix). Stillbirths are increasingly counted, which 
might be partly related to more visible estimates and 
rankings of SBR.9 More data are available for SBRs than 
in 2011, with the number of countries with no data 
reduced from 68 in 2011 to 38 in 2015. However, among 
those with data, 81 do not have nationally representative 
fi
 gures and more do not have trend data. In many 
settings, stillbirths are infrequently weighed at birth, 
especially for births occurring outside of health 
facilities. Shifts in the stillbirth defi
 nition to one based 
on gestational age should further increase data quality 
and comparability, recognising that further advances 
are needed in accuracy of gestational age assessment 
(panel 1).
Although SBR data have increased, data gaps remain 
for intrapartum SBR and more than 130 countries are 
without any available data, despite such information 
being recorded in most routine labour ward registries. 
The fact that an estimated 1·3 million intrapartum 
stillbirths, most of which are preventable, are not 
collated into hospital or national information systems 
should be a scandal.
Data improvements will need investments in national 
health information systems, as promoted by the 
Measurement and Accountability for Results roadmap,73 
which relates to the whole health management infor-
mation system, and the ENAP measurement improve-
ment roadmap, which focuses on newborns, stillbirths, 
and quality of care.74 As part of ENAP, WHO is 
developing perinatal audit as a means to assist in 
addressing modifi
 able factors,75 and to link to a 
minimum perinatal dataset.10 These initiatives provide 
opportunities to develop better methods that can be 
applied to address important research questions. 
However, investment is needed in high burden 
countries to operationalise this.
All babies should be registered at birth. Birth 
registration now covers two-thirds of the world’s 
livebirths but less than 5% of stillbirths. Coverage of 
death registration is even lower, covering less than 5% 
of neonatal deaths and even fewer stillbirths. Recording 
of all facility births, stillbirths (especially intrapartum), 
and newborn, child, and maternal deaths with standard 
defi
 nitions is feasible, and linking these to birth 
registration would rapidly increase SBR data availability, 
even by 2020. The inclusion of gestational age, 
birthweight, and associated maternal disorders on 
death certifi
 cates would greatly increase the usefulness 
of data, allowing cross tabulation of maternal and 
perinatal disorders. Including these data on birth 
certifi
 cates would provide important intergenerational 
information on health, such as outcomes of non-
communicable diseases.10
Accelerating progress to end preventable stillbirths 
requires improved data. Little investment has yet been 
made to increase coverage data for interventions that 
improve maternal and newborn health. This objective is 
an urgent priority and should include tracking content 
and quality of interventions specifi
 c to stillbirth 
prevention, particularly within antenatal care and 
intrapartum care.76 For example, coverage data for 
syphilis detection and treatment, components of 
advanced antenatal care, and intrapartum monitoring 
are absent in most countries and in global tracking. 
Additionally, data are needed to assess stigma 
associated with stillbirths and to measure provision of 
bereavement care.19 
The 2011 Lancet Stillbirths Series ranked research 
priorities for improving our understanding of stillbirth 
epidemiology (appendix).7 The top fi
 ve priorities centred 
on risk factors, and our review and analysis emphasise 
that little progress has been made on this knowledge base. 
Even for diseases such as malaria and HIV (and new ones, 
such as Ebola) with major investment, SBR, intrapartum 
SBR, or other pregnancy outcome data are rarely collected. 
Household surveys, a potentially important source of 
data in countries without robust routine data collection 
systems, are problematic for SBR data capture, but no 
research to address this issue is in progress. 
Methodological 
research 
is 
needed 
to 
improve 
understanding of which survey-based methods (eg, 
birth history, pregnancy history, and truncated 
pregnancy history) maximise the capture of data for 
stillbirths and how these fi
 ndings can be best 
implemented. Demographic surveillance sites, such as 
the INDEPTH network, provide a unique opportunity 
to test retrospective surveys against capture data for 
prospective pregnancies and also to assess the length of 
interviews, which is a major constraint in demographic 
and health surveys because the questionnaire already 
has long, complex questions.
With respect to the classifi
 cation of the causes of 
stillbirth, the greatest challenge is the development of a 
practical standardised classifi
 cation system with varying 
complexity of data from verbal autopsy to clinical 
assessment, made possible in basic facilities and centres 
with more extensive laboratory testing.77 WHO is

working on this issue. Resource-limited settings rely on 
verbal autopsy, especially for births that are not in health 
facilities.78,79 The frequently used WHO verbal autopsy 
guide,80 although retaining questions on the timing of 
stillbirth (fresh or macerated skin), no longer includes 
other questions on the causes of stillbirth. 
In each region of the world, the fastest progressing 
country for SBR (fi
 gure 1B, appendix) tended to make 
more progress than their neighbouring countries in data 
improvement. For example, Rwanda has increased birth 
registration and notably increased reporting of the baby’s 
birthweight from less than a third to more than two-
thirds (appendix).
Conclusion
After the transition from MDGs to SDGs, the global 
architecture for accountability for health outcomes is 
more complex. Ending preventable deaths of newborns 
and children younger than 5 years by 2030, as well as 
maternal mortality, are subtargets of SDG 3 (the only 
SDG health goal), with 16 other goals focused mainly on 
social and economic development and the environment. 
The discourse has shifted from health being essential for 
development, to development being necessary to improve 
health. Neonatal mortality now has an explicit SDG 
target. Many countries requested that WHO establish an 
explicit stillbirth target, which is why this goal was 
included in ENAP.3
Opportunities exist to meet this stillbirth target, with 
investment planned for national health information 
systems, including civil registration and vital statistics 
systems, and continuing calls for more use of data for 
accountability than at present. However, leadership is 
needed to include stillbirth data in these systems at a global 
level, especially in high burden countries.10,81 Leadership is 
needed at all levels but technical skills will be crucial to 
improve and use programmatic data to close quality and 
equity gaps. This advancement will need intentional 
investment in eff
 ective data systems and skills-building in 
communities most aff
 ected by stillbirth, including aff
 ected 
women.81 Household surveys have been strengthened to 
improve the capture of data for neonatal and child deaths; 
this data collection can also be done for stillbirths. At all 
health facilities, we call for systematic recording of 
stillbirths, especially intrapartum stillbirths, with collation 
and review of these data at both a local and national level, 
such as through a perinatal audit. Most stillbirths, 
particularly intrapartum stillbirths, are preventable and 
those due to syphilis and malaria should be deemed to be 
unacceptable even in the weakest health systems.
Improvements in data will not alone lead to change 
but provide accountability for targeting interventions, 
reaching the more than 7000 women every day 
worldwide who experience the reality of stillbirth. We 
call for a joint programmatic and measurement agenda 
that includes mothers, newborns, and stillbirths, to end 
all these preventable deaths.
