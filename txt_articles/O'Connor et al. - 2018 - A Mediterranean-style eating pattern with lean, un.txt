ABSTRACT
Background: A Mediterranean-style eating pattern (Mediterranean
Pattern) is often described as being low in red meat. Research shows
that lean, unprocessed red meat can be incorporated into healthy eat-
ing patterns to improve cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk factors.
Objective: We assessed the effects of consuming different amounts
of lean, unprocessed red meat in a Mediterranean Pattern on CMD
risk factors. We hypothesized that consuming a Mediterranean Pat-
tern would improve CMD risk factors and that red meat intake would
not influence these improvements.
Design: In an investigator-blinded, randomized, crossover, con-
trolled feeding trial, 41 subjects [mean ± SD age: 46 ± 2 y; mean
± SD body mass index (kg/m2): 30.5 ± 0.6] were provided with
a Mediterranean Pattern for two 5-wk interventions separated by
4 wk of self-selected eating. The Mediterranean Patterns contained
∼500 g [typical US intake (Med-Red)] and ∼200 g [commonly rec-
ommended intake in heart-healthy eating patterns (Med-Control)]
of lean, unprocessed beef or pork per week. Red meat intake was
compensated by poultry and other protein-rich foods. Baseline and
postintervention outcomes included fasting blood pressure, serum
lipids, lipoproteins, glucose, insulin, and ambulatory blood pressure.
The presented results were adjusted for age, sex, and body mass at
each time point (P < 0.05).
Results: Total cholesterol decreased, but greater reductions occurred
with Med-Red than with Med-Control (−0.4 ± 0.1 and −0.2 ±
0.1 mmol/L, respectively, intervention × time = 0.045]. Low-density
lipoprotein decreased with Med-Red but was unchanged with Med-
Control [−0.3 ± 0.1 and −0.1 ± 0.1 mmol/L, respectively, inter-
vention × time = 0.038], whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL)
concentrations decreased nondifferentially [−0.1 ± 0.0 mmol/L].
Triglycerides, total cholesterol:HDL, glucose, and insulin did not
change with either Med-Red or Med-Control. All blood pressure pa-
rameters improved, except during sleep, independent of the red meat
intake amount.
Conclusions: Adults who are overweight or moderately obese may
improve multiple cardiometabolic disease risk factors by adopting a
Mediterranean-style eating pattern with or without reductions in red
meat intake when red meats are lean and unprocessed. This trial was
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02573129.

INTRODUCTION
The historically low chronic disease rates in Mediterranean
countries are often attributed to eating habits. In the 1960s, a
Mediterranean-style eating pattern (Mediterranean Pattern) was
first recognized in a small cohort of coastal Greek olive farm-
ers who had lower rates of cardiovascular disease than six other
world regions (1). Their eating pattern was predominantly plant-
based, notably low in red meat, and olive oil was the main source
of fat (2). The health-promoting properties of a Mediterranean
Pattern, including reduced risk of developing cardiovascular dis-
ease and type 2 diabetes, are supported by recent and larger stud-
ies (3–7). These recent studies, including the Prevención con
Dieta Mediterránea (PREDIMED) (5) and Seguimiento Univer-
sidad de Navarra (SUN) cohorts (8), were largely conducted on
This study was funded in part by the Beef Checkoff, the Pork Checkoff, the

Spaniards who had higher red meat intakes (∼700–1200 g/wk)
(9) than the historic Greek olive farmers (∼245 g/wk) (10). These
studies are mostly observational in nature and were not designed
to directly compare consuming Mediterranean Patterns with dif-
ferent amounts of red meat intake on cardiometabolic disease risk
factors (CMD).
Conclusions about the cardiometabolic risks of consuming red
meat are historically inconsistent. The supporting literature base
consists largely of observational cohort studies in which “red
meat”is often ill-defined and grouped with processed meat as one
intake category (11). This leads to inconsistent conclusions about
the associations between red meat consumption and CMD (11).
More recent observational research which assesses unprocessed
red meat independently of processed meat shows little or no as-
sociation between unprocessed red meat consumption and CMD
(11, 12). In agreement, a compilation of randomized controlled
trial data shows that total red meat, but mostly unprocessed beef
and pork, consumption has no negative effect on cardiovascular
disease risk factors (13). Nevertheless, US residents are encour-
aged to lower their red meat intake (14, 15).
The foundation for the recommendation to lower red meat in-
take in the context of a Mediterranean Pattern is unclear. US res-
idents typically consume less red meat (11, 16) than what was
reported in the large Mediterranean Pattern studies showing car-
diometabolic benefits mentioned previously (5, 8). The primary
objective of this controlled feeding trial was to assess the effects
of consuming a Mediterranean Pattern with different amounts
of red meat on CMD risk factors. We compared a Mediter-
ranean Pattern with ∼500 g lean, unprocessed red meat/wk (Med-
Red) and a Mediterranean Pattern with ∼200 g lean, unpro-
cessed red meat/wk (Med-Control) because these are the amounts
that are typically consumed by US residents (11, 16) and com-
monly recommended in heart-healthy eating patterns (17, 18),
respectively. We hypothesized that the amount of red meat con-
sumed would not influence Mediterranean Pattern-induced im-
provements in CMD risk factors of adults who are overweight or
obese.
METHODS
Experimental design
This experimental design was a 16-wk randomized, crossover,
investigator-blinded, controlled feeding study. Subjects con-
sumed a Mediterranean Pattern for two 5-wk controlled feed-
ing interventions separated by at least 4 wk of a self-selected
and unrestricted eating pattern (washout). Dietary intake, body
mass and composition, and CMD risk factors [including total
cholesterol (total-C), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, total-
C:HDL cholesterol, total apolipoprotein B (ApoB), triglycerides,
glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, C-reactive protein (CRP), fasting
blood pressure, ambulatory blood pressure, and the Framing-
ham Heart Study 10-y cardiovascular disease risk and vascu-
lar age] were measured at both baselines and during the last
week of each Mediterranean Pattern intervention. Randomiza-
tion was completed using an online randomization plan genera-
tor (http://www.randomization.com/). The trial was registered at
clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02573129.
Subjects
Subjects who were overweight or obese [BMI (kg/m2) 25–
37], aged 30–69 y [representing middle-aged adults and adult-
hood life stage groups of the Dietary Reference Intakes (19)], and
not already following a Mediterranean Pattern [as indicated by a
score of <5 on the 14-item Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool
(20)] were recruited from the Greater Lafayette, IN area. Sub-
ject inclusion criteria were total-C <6.70 mmol/L, LDL choles-
terol <4.10 mmol/L, triglycerides <4.5 mmol/L, fasting glucose
<6.1 mmol/L, systolic blood pressure <160 mm Hg, diastolic
blood pressure <100 mm Hg, body mass <140 kg, no acute ill-
ness, nonsmokers, normal liver and kidney functions, and non-
diabetic. Subjects were required to be weight stable (±4.5 kg),
to have consistent physical activity levels for 3 mo prior to start-
ing the study, and to have stable medication use for 6 mo prior
to and throughout the study. A physician reviewed each individ-
ual’
s screening measurements to ensure that they met the study
inclusion criteria and to approve them for participation.
Assessment of self-selected eating pattern
Before being randomized into the study, subjects completed
the Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool (20) to confirm that they
were not already consuming a Mediterranean Pattern. Subjects
were instructed to consume their self-selected unrestricted eating
patterns (recorded with 3-d food logs) both during the baseline
testing weeks and throughout the washout.
Mediterranean Pattern
Menus were developed using Pronutra software (Viocare, Inc.)
and followed the PREDIMED protocol (21) to achieve the de-
sired Mediterranean Pattern. The menus were verified using the
Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool (20). Daily macronutrient
intakes were targeted at 40% of total energy as carbohydrate, 22%
protein, and 40% fat. Daily fat intakes were targeted at 7% of total
energy as saturated fat and 20% monounsaturated fat. Med-Red
and Med-Control differed predominantly in the amounts of red
meat and poultry provided. Further adjustments were required to
match the energy and macronutrients of the Med-Red and Med-
Control menus, which was achieved by manipulation of mainly
dairy, egg, and grain consumption. Fish and legume intake were
similar in both Mediterranean Patterns in order to achieve the de-
sired eating pattern per the PREDIMED protocol. Sodium, potas-
sium, magnesium, and calcium intakes were targeted to be within
±15% between the Med-Red and Med-Control menus, and were
calculated using the Linear Index Model (22). Each subject’
s en-
ergy requirement was estimated using sex-specific equations pub-
lished by the Institute of Medicine (19), and menus were designed
to maintain subjects’baseline 1 body mass. Subjects were given
the option to consume 150 mL of self-selected dry red wine daily.
All foods were prepared and provided to subjects during the
two Mediterranean Pattern interventions by the NIH-supported
Indiana Clinical Research Center Bionutrition Facility at Pur-
due University. The red meats and poultry provided were beef
or pork tenderloins and chicken or turkey breasts (white meat
with the skin removed prior to cooking). The meats were
consumed in mixed heterogeneous dishes. All red meat and
poultry provided was lean [<10 g total fat, <5 g saturated
fat, and <95 mg cholesterol (23)]. All red meats and poultry

underwent no further preservation processing beyond refriger-
ation or freezing (24), i.e., no smoking, curing, salting, or the
addition of chemical preservatives (14). While meat processing
terms vary, we use the term “unprocessed” throughout the arti-
cle to be consistent with previous literature on this topic (11).
Subjects weighed in and met with study staff weekly to mon-
itor body mass and promote compliance, respectively. Subjects
completed daily (and returned weekly) menu check-off lists to
track self-reported deviations from the provided Mediterranean
Pattern. Dietary intake and compliance were measured from
the menu check-off lists of 3 d during the last week of each
intervention.
Body mass and composition
Body mass and composition (percentage body fat and fat-free
mass) were measured at during both baselines periods and dur-
ing the last week of each intervention via the BOD POD Gold
Standard Body Composition Tracking System (COSMED USA,
Inc.).
Cardiometabolic disease risk factors
Cardiometabolic disease risk factors were measured for all
subjects (n = 41) during both baseline periods and during the
last week of each intervention. Fasting blood samples were col-
lected from an antecubital vein into serum separator tubes and
centrifuged for 15 min at 3.0 g and 4ºC. Fresh serum was then
shipped to Mid America Clinical Laboratories to determine total-
C, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and glucose concentrations via
enzymatic colorimetry using oxidase methods on a COBAS In-
tegra 400 Plus Analyzer (Roche Diagnostics Ltd). LDL choles-
terol was calculated using the following equation: LDL choles-
terol = total-C – [HDL cholesterol + (triglycerides/5)]. The
remaining serum was divided into samples, stored at −80ºC, then
thawed after all subjects had completed both interventions for
analyses of insulin, total ApoB, and CRP concentrations. Fast-
ing serum ApoB and CRP were measured via enzymatic col-
orimetry via oxidase methods on a COBAS Integra 400 Plus
analyzer. Fasting serum insulin was measured via an electro-
chemiluminescence immunoassay on COBAS e411 analyzer
(Roche Diagnostics Ltd).
Ambulatory and fasting blood pressures were measured during
both baseline periods and during the last week of each interven-
tion. Subjects wore an ambulatory blood pressure monitor for 48
h (Oscar2, Suntech Medical, Inc.). Blood pressure measurements
were taken at 30 min intervals during the day (0800–2100) and
at 90 min intervals through the night (2230–0730). Data were ex-
cluded from the analysis if >20% of scheduled measurements
were invalid. Fasting blood pressures were measured in a quiet,
dimly lit room. Measurements were taken after subjects sat up-
right for 15 min of rest (HEM-780, Omron Healthcare, Inc.). Two
measurements were recorded (a third if the values differed by
≥3 mm Hg) and were averaged.
Cardiometabolic disease risk prediction
Predictions of long-term cardiovascular disease risk and vascu-
lar age were calculated using the Framingham Heart Study 10-y
cardiovascular disease risk lipid equation (25).
Ethics
The study protocol and all study documents were approved
by the Purdue University Biomedical Institutional Review Board
(protocol #1501015662). All subjects provided written informed
consent and received a monetary stipend.
Statistics
Power calculations (G*Power version 3.1.9.2, Heinrich-
Heine-Universität Düsseldorf) indicated that 40 subjects would
provide >95% power to detect changes in fasting serum total-
C and fasting systolic blood pressure, as achieved in a simi-
lar randomized crossover trial assessing the effects of consum-
ing lean, unprocessed pork as opposed to chicken or fish in a
Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) eating pat-
tern (α = 0.05) (26). We hypothesized that the inclusion of un-
processed red meat in a Mediterranean Pattern would not in-
fluence changes in these variables. Power calculation indicated
that 40 subjects would provide >85% power to detect a dif-
ferential response between Med-Red and Med-Control that was
equal to half of the standard deviation of the response (effect
size = 0.5).
All data were double entered independently and cross-checked
for accuracy by the study manager (LEO). Data from 41 subjects
who completed both interventions were analyzed via a doubly
repeated-measures ANOVA using the PROC MIXED command
in SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute). This analysis measured: 1)
main effects of time (baseline compared with postintervention
measurements; one-tailed), 2) interaction of time and interven-
tion (Med-Red changes compared with Med-Control changes;
two-tailed), 3) changes over time within Med-Red and within
Med-Control (intervention-specific effect indicated by interven-
tion × time P value < 0.05; one-tailed), 4) comparison of Med-
Red and Med-Control baseline measurements (intervention ×
time sliced by time; two-tailed), 5) comparison of Med-Red and
Med-Control preintervention measurements (intervention × time
sliced by time; two-tailed), and 6) comparison of baseline 1
and baseline 2 measurements (trial × time interaction sliced by
time; two-tailed) to determine if subjects’baseline 1 health status
was re-established at baseline 2. These analyses were repeated
using baseline and intervention alcoholic drink-equivalents per
day as covariates. The PROC MIXED command in SAS uses
maximum likelihood to account for missing data in dependent
variables (27). The number of observations available at each
time point for all outcome variables are listed in Supplemental
Tables 1 and 2. All cardiometabolic outcomes of interest were
controlled for age, sex, and body mass at each time point, and
body mass and composition were controlled for age and sex. Re-
sults are presented as adjusted least squares (LS) means ± SEM,
and P values are Tukey-Kramer adjusted for multiple compar-
isons (P < 0.05).

RESULTS
Subject characteristics
Fifty individuals were randomized into the study, but 18% (9)
dropped out during week 1 of the first intervention. The remaining
41 subjects (28 women and 13 men) completed both interventions
(see Supplemental Figure 1). Baseline 1 values of mean age,
BMI, and fasting serum total-C, LDL cholesterol, HDL choles-
terol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin concentrations, and fasting
blood pressures are shown in Table 1.
Dietary intakes
Subjects were not consuming a Mediterranean Pattern at the
start of the study, as indicated by a mean score of 4 ± 0 on the
14-item Mediterranean Diet Assessment tool (20). Self-reported
dietary intake results from 3-d food logs did not differ between
baseline 1 and baseline 2, confirming that subjects resumed their
self-selected unrestricted eating patterns during the washout.
Mediterranean Diet Assessment Tool scores (20) increased
≥200%, as indicated by scores of 12 and 13 for the Med-
Red and Med-Control menus, respectively. The Med-Red menu
received one point less than Med-Control for the preferential
use of red meat over poultry. The Med-Red and Med-Control
menus had comparable daily energy contents, and intervention-
specific macronutrient distributions were within ±1% (see Table
2). Daily or weekly servings of the US Dietary Guidelines for
Americans designated food groups are shown in Table 3 for rep-
resentative Med-Red and Med-Control 7-d menu cycles. Mean
self-reported compliance to the provided Med-Red and Med-
Control menus were both ≥95%. Eleven subjects during Med-
Red and 14 subjects during Med-Control consumed less than one
150-mL serving of wine/wk and were classified as non-wine
drinkers. Among wine drinkers, 90 ± 3 mL of wine was con-
sumed per day, on average, in both Med-Red (n = 15) and Med-
Control (n = 12).
Body mass and composition
Chronologically, body mass at baseline 1 and baseline 2 did
not differ. Body mass decreased more with Med-Red than Med-
Control (−1.6 ± 0.5 compared with −1.0 ± 0.5 kg, intervention

fat percentage did not change with Med-Red or Med-Control.
Cardiometabolic disease risk factors
Chronologically, measurements of CMD risk factors at base-
line 1 and 2 did not differ. Med-Red decreased total-C 3% more
than Med-Control. LDL cholesterol and ApoB decreased by
8% and 6%, respectively, with Med-Red, but did not change
with Med-Control (see Figure 1). Total-C:HDL cholesterol,
triglycerides, CRP, glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR score did
not change with Med-Red or Med-Control. Fasting and ambu-
latory blood pressure parameters improved with both Mediter-
ranean Patterns, except during sleep, independent of red meat
intake amount (see Figure 2). There were no differences be-
tween postintervention values of Med-Red and Med-Control for
any CMD risk factors. Our results showed no difference be-
tween males and females in Mediterranean Pattern-induced car-
diometabolic changes, independent of red meat intake amount.
When considering baseline and intervention drink-equivalents as
a covariate, there were still greater reductions in total-C with
Med-Red, and reductions in LDL cholesterol with Med-Red
but no changes with Med-Control, but the overall time effect
and intervention-specific effects on ApoB diminished. Adjusted
means ± SEMs and unadjusted means ± SDs for all CMD risk
factors are available in Supplemental Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

risk (14, 15). Our results show that adopting a Mediterranean

Pattern with or without reducing red meat intake improves CMD
risk factors if the red meat is lean and unprocessed. Our results
support previous findings that consuming lean, unprocessed red
meat [∼120 g pork (26), ≤153 g beef (28–30), or ∼86 g lean
beef, veal, or lamb (31)/d] does not hinder the effectiveness of
a DASH pattern to improve CMD risk factors in the absence of
clinically meaningful body mass reductions.
The American Heart Association and the American College of
Cardiology declare inconsistent effects of consuming a Mediter-
ranean Pattern on blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations
(32). The randomized controlled trials referenced by these
societies are largely dietary counseling interventions and have
inadequate control groups (33–35). Our study provided a novel
opportunity to assess the effects of a Mediterranean Pattern in
a tightly controlled crossover trial. Adopting a Mediterranean
Pattern improved overall CMD risk factor profiles. However,
reductions in LDL cholesterol and ApoB concentrations were
largely attributable to Med-Red because there were no changes
in these outcomes with Med-Control. Our results indicate that
variations in Mediterranean Pattern compositions (36), such as
meat source, may help explain inconsistent effects described by
the American Heart Association and the American College of
Cardiology (32). Further, meat source in our study did not affect
Mediterranean Pattern-induced improvements in predictions
of long-term cardiovascular disease risk (Framingham Heart

Study 10-y cardiovascular disease risk and vascular age). These
results are consistent with evidence that a Mediterranean Pattern
decreases the risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and total mor-
tality (37), but changes in atherosclerosis-promoting lipid and
lipoprotein concentrations may not be the mechanism (38, 39).
This study was not designed to identify mechanisms by which
lean, unprocessed red meat consumption might differentially af-
fect atherosclerosis-promoting lipids and lipoprotein concentra-
tions. One speculation is that the greater body mass loss with
Med-Red may be a mediating factor. Despite randomization of
trial order, the baseline Med-Red body mass was quantitatively,
but not statistically, 0.7 kg higher than the baseline Med-Control
body mass. It is perhaps noteworthy that participants lost 0.6 kg
more during Med-Red than during Med-Control, which was a sta-
tistically significant difference. Both of these body mass changes
were modest (Med-Red: −1.8%; Med-Control: −1.1%), body
masses were not different at the end of the interventions, and
there were no differential changes in absolute or relative fat or fat-
free masses. We controlled for body weight at each time point in
our statistical model, and body mass was not a significant covari-
ate for total-C (P = 0.321) or LDL cholesterol (P = 0.125), but
was for ApoB (P = 0.035). The combination of the small magni-
tude of difference between Med-Red and Med-Control body mass
changes (clinical relevancy of 0.6 kg difference) and the lack of
significance in our statistical model suggests that the differential
effects in total-C, LDL cholesterol, and ApoB are not because of
differences in body mass. However, an impact of changes in body
mass on changes in LDL cholesterol cannot be ruled out.
Meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies show that each
100-g serving unprocessed red meat/d increases the risk of de-
veloping type 2 diabetes by 19% (11, 40), but there is a paucity
of experimental evidence to support this. Our Mediterranean

Changes in systolic blood pressures from consuming a Med-
Red or Med-Control diet for 5 wk. Results are presented as LS means ± SEMs
(n = 41). Data were analyzed using a doubly repeated-measures ANOVA ad-
justed for age, sex, and body mass at each time point. *Change over time.

Diastolic blood pressure results followed similar patterns and are available in
Supplemental Tables 1 and 2. LS, least squares; Med-Control, Mediterranean-
style eating pattern with ∼200 g lean, unprocessed red meat/wk; Med-
Red, Mediterranean-style eating pattern with ∼500 g lean, unprocessed red
meat/wk.
Pattern study and the weight maintenance DASH Pattern studies
previously mentioned (26, 29) showed no effect of these eating
patterns on fasting glucose, insulin, or HOMA-IR, independent
of red meat intake. One study compared the effects of energy-
restricted DASH Patterns substituting plant protein with beef (12,
139, or 196 g lean unprocessed beef) combined with exercise on
metabolic syndrome outcomes. The researchers concluded that
weight loss was the primary modifier of metabolic improvements,
independent of protein source (30). These studies support that
Med and DASH Patterns are typically not effective at improving
metabolic markers in the absence of weight loss or exercise (41–
44). These eating patterns, particularly over the short term, are
not suitable to assess the effects of red meat intake on changes
in glycemic control. Future randomized controlled trials are war-
ranted to assess the effects of lean, unprocessed red meat con-
sumption on type 2 diabetes risk factors in eating patterns known
to improve these outcomes.
There are different ways of quantifying the effectiveness of a
nutrition intervention on CMD outcomes. Most commonly, re-
searchers compare changes between groups or the differences be-
tween groups at the end of each intervention. In our study, 40 sub-
jects provided >95% power to detect changes in fasting serum
total-C and systolic blood pressure, and >85% power to detect
a differential response between Med-Red and Med-Control. It
is noteworthy that the postintervention values did not differ be-
tween Med-Red and Med-Control for any of the CMD risk fac-
tors measured, including those that showed differential changes
(total-C, LDL cholesterol, and ApoB). The end of intervention
values show that meat source did not influence Mediterranean
Pattern–induced cardiometabolic responses. These results are
consistent with previous studies that showed no postintervention
differences in CMD risk factors between traditional DASH Pat-
terns and DASH Patterns with higher red meat intake and similar
macronutrient distributions (26, 28, 29).
Our randomized controlled trial is strengthened by a low drop-
out rate (<18%) and a successful washout period (baseline 1
measures were re-established at baseline 2), but is not without
limitations. The self-reported >95% menu compliance was not
objectively confirmed. Our results are not generalizable to all cuts
of beef and pork because only tenderloins were provided to sub-
jects. Future studies should include various types of lean, unpro-
cessed red meat in a feasibility study to follow up on our findings.
We were unable to supply or encourage consumption of red wine
owing to university regulations, but slight differences in wine in-
take between the Med-Red and Med-Control groups did not in-
fluence the results. Although unintentional, 98% of our sample
population was Caucasian. Future research is needed to assess
whether race and/or ethnicity influences responses.
The 2000-kcal Mediterranean Pattern proposed by the Dietary
Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) contains ∼300 g red
meat/wk (45). The supporting literature base is largely prospec-
tive cohort studies that assess associations between red meat con-
sumption and chronic disease in the context of a Western-style
eating pattern (40, 46–48). Unhealthy lifestyle behaviors are cor-
related with red meat intake in this population which confounds
the positive associations between red meat and chronic disease
risk (49). The Mediterranean Pattern studies identified by the
DGAC show low chronic disease risk with red and processed
meat consumption up to ∼1200 g/wk for a 2000-kcal diet (9).
Our results, as well as the Mediterranean Pattern studies identi-
fied in the report, do not support red meat reductions in the con-
text of a Mediterranean Pattern. Further, the DGAC did not as-
sess the health effects of unprocessed red meat independent of
processed meats (which includes red meat and poultry). There
is building evidence that unprocessed red meat consumption has
little to no influence on cardiometabolic disease risk compared
with processed meats (11, 12). Future DGACs need not only to
consider the amount of red meat included in a Mediterranean Pat-
tern, but also to be cognizant of the leanness and degree of meat
processing.
In conclusion, adults who are overweight or obese can con-
sume typical US intake quantities of red meat (∼70 g/d) as lean
and unprocessed beef and pork when adopting a Mediterranean
Pattern to improve cardiometabolic disease risk factors. Our re-
sults support previous observational and experimental evidence
which shows that unprocessed and/or lean red meat consumption
does not increase the risk of developing cardiovascular disease
(11) or impair associated risk factors (13).
