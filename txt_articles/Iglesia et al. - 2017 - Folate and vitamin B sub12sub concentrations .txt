 Abstract
This study aimed to examine the association between vitamin B6, folate and vitamin B12 biomarkers and plasma fatty acids in European
adolescents. A subsample from the Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence study with valid data on B-vitamins and fatty acid
blood parameters, and all the other covariates used in the analyses such as BMI, Diet Quality Index, education of the mother and physical
activity assessed by a questionnaire, was selected resulting in 674 cases (43 % males). B-vitamin biomarkers were measured by
chromatography and immunoassay and fatty acids by enzymatic analyses. Linear mixed models elucidated the association between B-vitamins
and fatty acid blood parameters (changes in fatty acid profiles according to change in 10 units of vitamin B biomarkers). DHA, EPA) and n-3
fatty acids showed positive associations with B-vitamin biomarkers, mainly with those corresponding to folate and vitamin B12. Contrarily,
negative associations were found with n-6:n-3 ratio, trans-fatty acids and oleic:stearic ratio. With total homocysteine (tHcy), all the
associations found with these parameters were opposite (for instance, an increase of 10 nmol/l in red blood cell folate or holotranscobalamin
in females produces an increase of 15·85 µmol/l of EPA (P value <0·01), whereas an increase of 10 nmol/l of tHcy in males produces a
decrease of 2·06 µmol/l of DHA (P value <0·05). Positive associations between B-vitamins and specific fatty acids might suggest underlying
mechanisms between B-vitamins and CVD and it is worth the attention of public health policies.
Key words: Fatty acids: B-vitamins: Adolescents: Europe
Atherosclerotic CVD is the main cause of death worldwide(1).
Over the last few decades, an increase in CVD risk factors such
as excess body weight, insulin resistance or glucose intolerance
among others has been observed in both children and adoles-
cents(2). Such evidences support claims to independently assess
the effect of different CVD risk factors in these age groups and
promote strategies to prevent future events of atherosclerosis(3).
Cardiovascular risk factors including high serum concentra-
tions of total cholesterol, TAG or LDL-cholesterol or low levels
of HDL-cholesterol are associated with the development of
arterial fatty streaks(4) and increased total homocysteine (tHcy)
concentrations. The latter is considered an independent pre-
dictor of cardiovascular mortality or of all-cause mortality(5)
because of its role in oxidative stress, endothelium damage and
thrombogenicity enhancement(6). However, a debate exists
about whether tHcy should be interpreted as a risk factor or a
biomarker of cardiovascular events.
Results from large prospective studies suggest that elevated
circulating concentrations of tHcy are associated with increased
risk of CVD, regardless of other well-known risk factors such as
smoking, high blood pressure, high serum lipids and obesity(7).
At the same time, results of a recent meta-analysis showed that
tHcy-lowering interventions did not reduce the occurrence of
cardiovascular events(8). It could be explained by the fact that
homozygous carriers of the 677C-T polymorphism on the
methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene have higher CVD
risk, which implies higher tHcy circulating levels(7,9).
A
recent
systematic
review
examining
the
impact
of
homocysteine-lowering interventions via increased vitamins B6,
folate or B12 supplement uptake on cardiovascular events failed
to identify any relationship(10). This fact set out the possibility
that the positive associations between serum homocysteine and
CVD risk may be confounded by other cardiovascular risk
factors(11) such as low plasma (n-3) long-chain PUFA levels.
The main (n-3) long-chain PUFA such as EPA and DHA are
suggested to act as cardioprotective elements by lowering
blood pressure and heart rate, reducing serum TAG, thrombotic
tendency, inflammation and arrhythmias and by improving
endothelial function, insulin sensitivity, paraoxonase con-
centrations and plaque stability(12). Previous animal(13–15) and
human(16–18) studies have reported that some changes in
plasma fatty acid (FA) concentrations might be explained by
B-vitamin biomarkers because of their role as cofactors in the
methylation of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphati-
dylcholine (PC), crucial in the transport of PUFA in the blood.
The latter could explain the controversial results observed
regarding the association between tHcy and CVD risk. How-
ever, results obtained in such studies were also inconsistent
among them(13–18).
Assumptions that B-vitamin biomarkers involved in tHcy
regulation are linked to serum phospholipid (PL) FA profiles
have not been studied in young populations yet. The aim of this
study was to examine the association between vitamin B6, folate
and vitamin B12 biomarkers (including tHcy) and fasting lipid
profile and serum PL FA profile (focusing on n-3 FA) in healthy
European adolescents.
Methods
Study design
The Healthy Lifestyle in Europe by Nutrition in Adolescence
Cross-Sectional Study (HELENA-CSS) obtained standardised,
reliable and comparable data on relevant nutrition and health-
related parameters from a large sample of European adoles-
cents(19). Fieldwork took place from November 2006 to
December 2007 in ten cities (Vienna, Ghent, Lille, Dortmund,
Athens, Heraklion, Pecs, Rome, Zaragoza and Stockholm) of
nine European countries (two in Greece).
Subjects
Adolescents aged 12·5–17·5 years were randomly recruited
from selected schools. The HELENA-CSS study population
consisted of 3528 adolescents (response rate 61·3 %)(20). Of
those, a subsample of 1089 adolescents was randomly selected
for blood sampling. For the purposes of this study, only ado-
lescents with available information on B-vitamin biomarkers,
lipid profile, serum PL FA, BMI and Diet Quality Index (DQI)
were included, resulting in 674 cases (43 % males). Sampling
selection procedures can be observed in Fig. 1.
The present study was performed following the ethical
guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki, the Good Clinical
Practice rules and the legislation about clinical research in
Fatty acids and B vitamins in adolescents

 human subjects of the participating countries. The Ethics
Committees of the involved centres approved the study proto-
col and procedures, and all subjects and their parents or legal
guardians signed an informed written consent form(21).
Assessment of vitamin B6, folate and vitamin B12 biomarker
concentrations as well as serum phospholipid fatty acids
Assessment and analysis of biological samples in the study have
already been described elsewhere(22,23). In brief, fasting blood
samples were collected by venepuncture at school. Plasma
folate (PF), serum vitamin B12, tHcy and red blood cell folate
(RBC-folate) were measured by competitive immunoassay
(Immulite 2000; DPC Biermann GmbH) (CV for PF = 5·4 %,
RBC-folate = 10·7 %,
serum
vitamin
B12 = 5·0 %).
Pyridoxal
5'-phosphate (PLP) was measured by HPLC (Varian Deutsch-
land GmbH; CV = 1 %). Serum holotranscobalamin (HoloTC)
was assayed by microparticle enzyme immunoassay (Active
B12;
Axis-Shield
Ltd,
CV = 5·1 %)
using
AxSYM
(Abbott
Diagnostics)(22).
TAG as well as HDL- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations
were enzymatically assayed by the Dimension RxL clinical
chemistry system (Dade Behring).
Serum FA composition from PL was determined by capillary
GC (model 3900; Varian GmbH) after extraction performed by
TLC using the standard 1,2 Dipentadecanoyl-sn-glycero-3-
phosphocholine. The total amount of FA was obtained as a
result of the percentage area by integrating the area under the
peak and dividing it by the total area for all FA. The CV was
4·4 % for all serum PL FA analyses(24). The headings ‘saturated
fatty acids’, ‘MUFA’, PUFA’, ‘trans’, ‘ω3’ and ‘ω6’ include all types
of these FA identified during blood analyses.
Diet Quality Index for adolescents
DQI was computed from data obtained from two non-
consecutive, 24-h recalls performed via a computer-based,
self-reported tool called the HELENA Dietary Assessment
Tool(25). This tool was based on a previous version developed
for Flemish adolescents, the Young Adolescents’ Nutrition
Assessment on Computer valid for twenty-nine food groups
aggregated according to the European Food Groups classifica-
tion system(26) and for several nutrients apart from energy,
including macronutrients, fibre, Ca, Fe and vitamin C(25). Total
daily food intake was distributed into six meal occasions. For
each occasion, the user was invited to select all the consumed
food items and beverages from a standardised food list. If any
food or beverage was not included in the list, they could be
added manually at any time. Household measurements or pic-
tures of portion sizes were used to obtain information on
quantities. The DQI used in this study was originally developed
for preschool-aged children(27), and was later adapted and
validated for use in adolescents(28) and consists of three com-
ponents: dietary quality, dietary diversity and dietary equili-
brium. This index is used as an indicator of compliance with the
Flemish Food Based Dietary Guidelines, which are very similar
to dietary guidelines in other countries including the WHO
CINDI (Countrywide Integrated Non-communicable Disease
Intervention programme) pyramid, making it applicable for a
European population(28).
Physical examination
Weight and height were measured with an electronic scale
(SECA 861; Seca Ltd) and with a telescopic stadiometer (SECA
225; Seca Ltd) to the nearest 0·1 kg and to the nearest 0·1 cm,
respectively(29). BMI was calculated as body weight(30) divided
by the square of height (m). In addition, BMI was adjusted for
age and sex providing a BMI standard deviation score using the
British 1990 growth reference data from the Child Growth
Foundation(31).
Socio-economic status and self-reported physical activity
Maternal education was used as proxy for socio-economic
status obtained via a self-administered questionnaire. This
variable was assessed using four categories (elementary, lower
secondary, higher secondary or tertiary education)(32).
The level of physical activity was obtained using the validated
International Physical Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents
(IPAQ-A), adapted and validated for the HELENA study(33). The
IPAQ-A covers four physical activity domains during the whole
week: school-related physical activity (including activity during
physical education classes and breaks), transportation, house-
work and activities during leisure time. Activities were later
classified into low, moderate and vigorous activities on the
basis of guidelines for data processing and analyses of the
IPAQ-A(34). Total time spent on moderate-to-vigorous activity
was summed and truncated to avoid overestimation(35).

variables and by Pearson’s χ2 test for categorical variables. Tests
for normality were performed using the Kolmogorov–Smirnov
test.
B-vitamin
biomarkers,
fasting
lipids
and
serum
PL
FA-related variables were logarithmically transformed to obtain
a normal distribution.
Associations between either fasting lipid profile or serum PL
FA and B-vitamin biomarkers (vitamin B6, folate, vitamin B12
and tHcy as independent variables) were tested with linear
mixed-effects models to control for study design (clustering of
cases within cities), including z-scores of BMI, DQI, maternal
education and physical activity. Associations are presented in
terms of change in 10 units of the independent variables
(B-vitamin biomarkers) to ease interpretation and to present
biologically relevant results. A coefficient lower than 10 implies
a negative association, whereas a coefficient higher than 10
implies a positive one. In addition, single univariate tests con-
trolling for the false discovery rate, using the widely agreed 0·25
cut-off point(36) with the Benjamini–Hochberg method(37), were
performed to control for the type I error inflation associated
with multiple testing. Significance was established according to
the new P values obtained after applying the Benjamini–
Hochberg method. PASW 20.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Inc.)
was used to run the analyses.
Results
Several significant differences in terms of descriptive char-
acteristics were observed between included and excluded
participants (data not shown). In the whole HELENA study
sample, males represented 48 %, whereas for the sample
included in this analysis males represent 43 %. For instance,
included males had significantly lower BMI and higher DQI
scores, and there were significant differences in terms of
maternal education (P < 0·001) as compared with those exclu-
ded. No differences were observed in females. Included males
had lower levels of DHA (P < 0·05), whereas included females
had higher levels of palmitoleic acid and palmitoleic:palmitic
ratio (P < 0·05). Both male and female participants had higher
levels of α-linolenic fatty acid compared with adolescents
excluded from the analysis. No differences were found between
included
and
excluded
adolescents
regarding
B-vitamin
biomarkers.
Table 1 presents adolescents’ characteristics stratified by sex.
Females had significantly higher DQI scores and lipid para-
meters as opposed to males. Males had significantly higher
weekly moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, lower levels of
serum vitamin B12, and higher PLP and tHcy levels (P < 0·01).
The mean palmitoleic:palmitic acid ratio was identical for both
sexes.
Associations presented in Table 2 reflect changes in 10 units
of the independent variables (B-vitamin biomarkers). A coeffi-
cient lesser than 10 implies a negative association. Overall,
more significant associations were found between folate and
vitamin B12 biomarkers and fasting lipid profile and serum PL
FA status as compared with PLP or tHcy concentrations. All
significant associations found with tHcy were negative, except
for the oleic:stearic ratio where a positive significant association
was observed in males with an increase of 10 µmol in tHcy
concentrations, resulting in a decrease in the PL FA in serum.
The associations found between either fasting lipid profile or
serum PL FA and B-vitamin biomarkers were always in the
opposite direction as those found with tHcy. Moreover, the
association found between TAG and serum vitamin B12 was
positive for males and negative for females. Most of the
significant associations were observed between B-vitamin
biomarkers and DHA, n-3 FA and n-3:n-6 ratio as the
dependent variables.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the
associations between B-vitamin biomarkers and serum PL FA in
a large sample of adolescents and one of the few available in
humans. Our results primarily showed that folate and vitamin
B12 biomarkers and homocysteine concentrations were asso-
ciated with serum PL FA, mainly with the n-3 pathway. Evi-
dence of associations in the literature is unclear and often
debatable. Some studies have reported associations between
B-vitamin biomarkers and PUFA both in animals(15,38) and in
humans(15,18,39), whereas others have failed to observe any
associations in elderly and pregnant women(16,40). However,
this is the first time that such associations are explored in a
population of healthy adolescents. It is of great importance to
further investigate such associations in future studies because of
their role in CVD. It would also be relevant to evaluate the link
between both B-vitamins and FA and DNA methylation and
future conditions such as cancer or other metabolic diseases(41).
Another HELENA-based subanalysis by Vyncke et al.(42)
showed that food intake could explain a limited variance of
serum PL FA, being maximal for the n-3 FA (14·2 %). We have
also observed that the highest variance of B-vitamin con-
centrations explained by the habitual combination of foods
consumed by a subject or a population group, referring to the
dietary patterns(43), consists of only 17 % (unpublished results).
In previous studies, the DQI showed positive associations
with HoloTC and with n-3 FA(28). In our study, associations
between B-vitamin biomarkers, FA and lipids fraction were
adjusted for DQI scores to mitigate the effect of diet in observed
associations. However, we cannot preclude that some of the
observed associations may be due to the combination of both
B-vitamins and FA contained in the same food items. For
instance, previous analyses showed that fish products are
important contributors of both DHA(44) and folate(45), and such
products were found to be positively associated with the DQI,
whereas less healthy foods showed negative associations. In
this sense, it is important to consider the DQI dietary equili-
brium component as it might influence negatively the total
score if a food group is consumed in excess(28).
Two physiological pathways that may explain such associa-
tions have been described(15,18). However, despite the plausi-
bility of both mechanisms, the specific metabolic pathway
linking both B-vitamins and FA has not been clearly established.
First, B-vitamins act as cofactors in the methylation process as

 described in Fig. 2. The methylation of PE to PC by phospha-
tidylethanolamine
methyltransferase
(PEMT)
requires
the
methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). This reaction is
inhibited by S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH). SAH is hydro-
lysed
to
homocysteine
throughout
a
reversible
reaction:
homocysteine will result in increased SAH, thereby inhibiting
PEMT(15). In the liver, PC is crucial for the transport of PUFA in
the blood, particularly DHA.
Nevertheless, in a randomised controlled trial (RCT) of 253
elderly participants(16), results did not support this mechanism,
as the proportion of EPA, docosapentaenoic acid and DHA
acids in plasma PC did not differ between the B-vitamin
supplementation and the placebo groups after 2 years of
intervention. This lack of agreement in the results could be due
to differences in the study design (RCT against cross-sectional)
and population group (elderly against adolescents), as several
studies have suggested that n-3 PUFA metabolism changes with
age, provided that Δ6 desaturase (a PLP-dependent enzyme)
decreases with age(47). This fact would affect the second pro-
posed mechanism.
The second plausible mechanism is based on the impairment
of hepatic Δ6 desaturase activity. The Δ6 desaturase is a PLP-
dependent enzyme, required for the interconversion of high-
unsaturated
fatty
acids
(HUFA)(18)
into
PUFA

 arachidonic acid (20 : 4 n-6) and DHA (22 : 6 n-3). This was also
observed in one in vitro study with cultured cells(48) in which a
reduction in vitamin B6 levels led to changes in the n-3 and n-6
long-chain PUFA profile in parallel with reductions in the rate of
the desaturation processes. They also found that concentrations
of total FA and PL species were higher in vitamin B6-deficient
cells, as it was also observed in some studies in rats(49,50). This
might be because of the reduction in FA oxidation rates and

Fatty acids and B vitamins in adolescents

Downloaded from https://www.cambridge.org/core. IP address: 77.173.35.219, on 02 Jun 2019 at 07:33:22, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at https://www.cambridge.org/core/terms. https://doi.org/10.1017/S0007114516004414
 their accumulation into cells because of the impairment
of carnitine whose synthesis might be affected in case of
vitamin B6 deficiency(51).
In view of the observed associations, this second pathway is
less likely to explain our results, as more consistent associations
were found for folate and vitamin B12 biomarkers than for PLP
(vitamin B6 biomarker). However, it is suggested elsewhere(48)
that this pathway is more probable than the first one as SAM
concentrations were higher, but SAH was lower in the cultured
cells with vitamin B6 restriction. However, the study did not
consider the interaction between folate and vitamin B12.
In our study, the pro-inflammatory index n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio
was significantly lower in adolescents with higher concentra-
tions of B-vitamin biomarkers; however, the n-6:n-3 PUFA
ratio
was
significantly
higher
in
those
with
higher
tHcy concentrations. PLP concentrations were also reported
to be inversely associated with C-reactive protein among
other
pro-inflammatory
markers,
independent
of
plasma
homocysteine concentrations(52). This association has been
speculated to reflect the mobilisation of this coenzyme into
inflammatory sites. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms
remain unclear.
It is worth noticing that we observed an inverse association
between PF concentrations and trans-FA. Trans-FA can inhibit
the activity of Δ6 desaturase in the liver and subsequently
decrease the efficacy of HUFA interconversion(18) into PUFA.
Trans-FA are a special type of unsaturated fatty acids with one
double bond in the trans position and they can be naturally or
industrially present in food products. Their presence in food
products is highly variable (from 1 to 50 % industrially, to 2 to
9 % naturally)(53). Because of
the
established association
between trans-FA and CVD(54), the food industry has drastically
decreased the content of these trans-FA in their products in the
last decade, but there are still some European countries, espe-
cially in Eastern Europe, where levels are still elevated(53). Our
study was performed in 2006; at the time, the vast majority of
trans-FA intakes came from industrial products and their level
in blood was already low. The levels of these FA would be even
lower, and it is very likely that such an association would not
have been found if our study was reproduced today.
The ratios product:precursor of 18 : 1n-9cis:18 : 0 (oleic:stearic)
(oleoyl-CoA
desaturase
activity)
and
16 : 1n-7cis:16 : 0
(palmitoleic:palmitic) (stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity) measured
in plasma PL are integrated markers of SFA intake(55). These ratios
are
relevant
as
they
are
associated
with
increasing
risks
of obesity, diabetes or cancer(56,57). We found positive associations
of oleic:stearic acid with homocysteine and negative associations
with PF and the biomarkers of vitamin B12 in males. This might be
because of the fact that B-vitamins play a role as cofactors in the
metabolism of sulphur-containing amino acids such as homo-
cysteine and these are related with lipid metabolism as reported in
several studies(58); however, this explanation needs to be con-
firmed. Recently, several studies have suggested that sulphur-
containing amino acids modulate the expression of stearoyl-CoA
desaturase-1, a key enzyme in the hepatic synthesis of MUFA(59).
Considerations of the study
This study has several strengths including the use of harmo-
nised, standardised and validated tools and procedures in a
large sample of European adolescents(12). Another important
strength is the availability of B-vitamin biomarkers, accepted in
the literature (PLP, PF, RBC-folate, HoloTC, tHcy) or widely
used (serum B12)(22), which accurately reflect B-vitamins’ status
and complement dietary assessment methods. Moreover, all
these biomarkers were centrally analysed, increasing the

 accuracy of the laboratory results(21). Finally, the HELENA study
sample size was calculated on the basis of the variance of BMI,
which is a variable with the greatest variability in studies
assessing the nutritional status in adolescents, which reinforces
the representativeness of the data. Besides, different geo-
graphical areas across Europe and different socio-demographic
groups were recruited. Sexual maturation of this sample of
European adolescents has been previously described(20), and
the distribution of Tanner(60) categories, both in males and
females, was between the third and the fifth stage. Therefore,
our results could be extrapolated to similar groups of healthy
adolescents living in European cities.
On the other hand, the present study has several limitations.
The sources of trans-FA isomers (natural or industrial) were not
analysed in this study, and therefore we can only consider
trans-FA in total, and the authors assume that the majority came
from industrial sources. Similarly, choline, which might also
influence our results, was not measured.
In addition, the reduction of the sample from the original
1089 adolescents with blood samples, due to the unavailability
of the variables of interest for this analysis, poses a study limi-
tation. Besides, the cross-sectional design of the study does not
allow us to establish cause–consequence relationships from the
variables of interest.
Only as a consideration, previous reports based on the
HELENA study have shown that the association between FA
intake and plasma FA cannot be assumed, except for several
long-chain n-3 PUFA(42). In fact, it seems that plasma FA con-
centrations in adolescents could be seldom explained by diet,
being maximal at 14·2 % for the n-3 FA. This lack of association
between FA intake and biomarkers may be explained by the
different routes followed by FA once metabolised in the human
body (oxidation, elongation and desaturation, to be incorpo-
rated in cell membranes, or stored in the adipose tissue(42)).
This is why we have used the DQI as a covariate to control for
diet instead of FA intake. In addition, a better overall dietary
quality, assessed with the DQI, was associated with a higher
total fat intake (expressed as % energy) in males and females in
a previous study(61).
Conclusion
B-vitamin-related biomarkers, especially those corresponding
to folate and vitamin B12, were positively associated with serum
PL FA, mainly with the n-3 pathway, whereas these associations
were negative with homocysteine levels. Among the possible
mechanisms that might explain our results, the influence of these
vitamins in the conversion of PE to PC, which is the main
membrane PL in transporting actively the PUFA, seems to be the
most likely route. However, additional experiments are required
in which additional parameters should be measured – for
example, plasma and tissue levels of SAM or SAH.
To conclude, our findings suggest that higher B-vitamin
biomarker concentrations might be related to higher PUFA
concentrations
(mainly
n-3
series).
Besides,
the
pro-
inflammation marker n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio decreased with
increasing values of B-vitamin biomarkers, as with trans-FA
(probably because of different dietary sources in this case) and
the oleic:stearic acid ratio. Consequently, assuring a good status
of B-vitamin biomarkers is very important as it might influence
cardiovascular health by lowering homocysteine levels, but also
by
increasing
circulating
n-3
PUFA
and
decreasing
the
pro-inflammatory marker n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio.
