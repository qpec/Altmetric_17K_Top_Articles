Tertiary Care Center — Virginia, 2000–2015

In April 2016, a Virginia dentist who had recently received 
a diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and was 
undergoing treatment at a specialty clinic at a Virginia tertiary 
care center contacted CDC to report concerns that IPF had 
been diagnosed in multiple Virginia dentists who had sought 
treatment at the same specialty clinic. IPF is a chronic, pro-
gressive lung disease of unknown cause and associated with 
a poor prognosis (1). Although IPF has been associated with 
certain occupations (2), no published data exist regarding IPF 
in dentists. The medical records for all 894 patients treated 
for IPF at the Virginia tertiary care center during September 
1996–June 2017 were reviewed for evidence that the patient 
had worked as a dentist, dental hygienist, or dental technician; 
among these patients, eight (0.9%) were identified as dentists 
and one (0.1%) as a dental technician, and each had sought 
treatment during 2000–2015. Seven of these nine patients had 
died. A questionnaire was administered to one of the living 
patients, who reported polishing dental appliances and prepar-
ing amalgams and impressions without respiratory protection. 
Substances used during these tasks contained silica, polyvinyl 
siloxane, alginate, and other compounds with known or poten-
tial respiratory toxicity. Although no clear etiologies for this 
cluster exist, occupational exposures possibly contributed. This 
cluster of IPF cases reinforces the need to understand further 
the unique occupational exposures of dental personnel and the 
association between these exposures and the risk for develop-
ing IPF so that appropriate strategies can be developed for the 
prevention of potentially harmful exposures.
IPF is a form of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial 
pneumonia of unknown cause. IPF is associated with histo-
pathologic and radiologic patterns of usual interstitial pneu-
monia in the absence of other known causes of interstitial 
lung disease (1) and is characterized by unexplained slowly 
progressive dyspnea that can be accompanied by a nonproduc-
tive cough (2). Available treatment options for IPF include 
pharmacotherapy (i.e., pirfenidone and nintedanib) and lung 
transplantation (2). The estimated median survival after diag-
nosis is 3–5 years (2). Although the etiology of IPF is unknown, 
exposures that have been suggested as contributing factors 
include viral infections, cigarette smoking, and occupations 
where exposure to dust, wood dust, and metal dust are com-
mon (2). In the United States, on the basis of the case defini-
tions used by separate studies to analyze data collected during 
1988–2005, the estimated annual incidence of IPF varied 
from 6.8 to 17.4 per 100,000 population, and the estimated 
prevalence varied from 14.0 to 63.0 per 100,000 population 
(3) and increased with increasing age (2). No published data 
could be found regarding dental personnel and IPF.
In June 2017, the electronic medical records of all 894 
patients with a diagnosis of IPF treated at the Virginia spe-
cialty clinic during September 1996–June 2017 were reviewed 
to identify patients having the occupation of dentist, dental 
hygienist, or dental technician. Available electronic medical 
records of patients identified as having one of these occupa-
tions were reviewed, pertinent data were abstracted, and an 
attempt was made to interview living patients to ascertain 
symptoms and occupational and nonoccupational exposures, 
after obtaining informed consent. This study received approval 
from the Inova Fairfax Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Among 894 patients treated for IPF at the tertiary care 
center, nine (1%) were identified as dental personnel, includ-
ing eight dentists and one dental technician. All patients were 
male and were treated during 2000–2015. Five were white, one 
was black, and the race of three was unknown. At the time of 
pulmonary consultation, the median patient age was 64 years 
(range = 49–81 years) (Table). States of residence included 
Virginia (five), Maryland (three), and Georgia (one). Seven of 
the nine patients had died; among these, the median survival 
time from consultation was 3 years (range = 1–7 years). Among 
eight patients tested at the time of pulmonary consultation, 
pulmonary function tests demonstrated three patients had 
normal spirometry, two of whom also had documented nor-
mal lung volumes, and five patients had restrictive spirometry 
and low lung volumes, interpreted as lung restriction. Each of 
the five patients with restriction had low predicted values for 
diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) 
(median = 47% [range = 19%–55%]). Pulmonary function 
test results were not available for one patient. One of the living 
patients who did not complete an interview underwent a lung 
transplant 3 years after diagnosis. No tissue specimens were 
available for analysis.
Three patients were former smokers, one had never smoked, 
and smoking history was unknown for five (Table). A tele-
phone interview was conducted with the patient who had 
contacted CDC; it was not possible to complete an interview 
with the other living patient. The interviewed patient, who

had never smoked, reported not wearing a National Institute 
for Occupational Safety and Health-certified respirator during 
dental activities throughout his 40-year dental practice; he wore 
a surgical mask for the last 20 years of his dental practice. He 
reported performing polishing of dental appliances, preparing 
amalgams and impressions, and developing x-rays using film 
developing solutions. He also reported work-related exposure 
to dust while working as a street sweeper for 3 months before 
entering dental school and environmental exposure to dust 
from coral beaches for approximately 15 years while intermit-
tently visiting the Caribbean region as a practicing dentist.
Discussion
During September 1996–June 2017, nine (1%) of 894 
patients treated for IPF at a single tertiary care center in 
Virginia were identified as dental personnel. Each patient 
presented for care during 2000–2015. Seven of the patients 
had died. This is the first known described cluster of IPF 
occurring among dental personnel. Although no clear etiology 
exists for this cluster, it is possible that occupational exposures 
contributed to the development of IPF.
During 2016, dentists accounted for an estimated 0.038% 
of U.S. residents (4), yet represented 0.893% of patients 
undergoing treatment for IPF at one tertiary care center, 
nearly a 23-fold difference. Dental personnel are exposed to 
infectious agents, chemicals, airborne particulates, ionizing 
radiation, and other potentially hazardous materials (5). 
Inhalational exposures experienced by dentists likely increase 
their risk for certain work-related respiratory diseases. For 
example, cases of dental technicians with pneumoconiosis, a 
restrictive occupational lung disease resulting from inhalation 
of dust, have been identified after exposure to either silica 
or cobalt-chromium-molybdenum-based dental prostheses 
(6,7). A case of pneumoconiosis was identified postmortem 
in an elderly dentist who died from respiratory failure (8). 
Examination of lung tissue at autopsy using scanning electron 
microscopy revealed particles consistent with alginate impres-
sion powders used during the dentist’s practice. Nine cases of 
silicosis were recognized among dental laboratory technicians 
exposed to crystalline silica in five states during 1994–2000 
(9). Asbestos-related lung disease, attributed to manipulating 
wet asbestos-containing paper during preparation of molds in 
casting operations, has also been identified in dentists (10). The 
one living patient in this cluster who was interviewed reported 
occupational exposures to silica and other materials used in 
dental practice, but also other work-related and environmental 
exposures to dust.
IPF has not been previously described among dental person-
nel. However, a query of the National Occupational Respiratory 
Mortality System for 4 separate years (1999, 2003, 2004, and 
2007) for “other interstitial pulmonary diseases with fibrosis”* 
(which would include IPF) listed as the underlying or con-
tributing cause of death revealed 35 decedents categorized as 
* International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) code J84.1.

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive lung 
disease of unknown cause and is associated with a poor progno-
sis. IPF has been associated with certain occupations; however, no 
published data exist regarding IPF in dental personnel.
What is added by this report?
A unique cluster of nine cases of IPF was identified among 
dental personnel treated at a tertiary care center in Virginia 
during 2000–2015. No clear etiology has been identified, but 
occupational exposures are possible.
What are the implications for public health practice?
During 2016, approximately 650,000 dental personnel were 
estimated to be employed in the United States, including 
122,330 dentists. This cluster of IPF cases reinforces the need to 
understand further the occupational exposures of dental 
personnel and the association between these exposures and 
the risk for developing IPF so that strategies can be developed 
for prevention of potentially harmful exposures.
having worked in the “office of dentists” and 19 categorized as 
having the occupation “dentist,” with proportionate mortality 
ratios of 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05–2.11) 
and 1.67 (95% CI = 1.01–2.61), respectively (Respiratory 
Health Division, CDC, unpublished data, 2017). These find-
ings suggest that a higher rate of IPF might occur among dental 
personnel than among the general population.
The living patient who was interviewed reported occupa-
tional exposures to known respiratory hazards (e.g., silica) yet 
did not wear National Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health-certified respiratory protection. It is possible other 
patients in this case series had similar experiences. Dental per-
sonnel who perform tasks that result in occupational exposures 
to known respiratory hazards should wear adequate respira-
tory protection if other controls (e.g., improved ventilation) 
are not practical or effective (https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/
respiratoryprotection/index.html). If respiratory protection 
is used, a written respiratory protection program should be 
implemented as required by the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration Respiratory Protection Standard, 
including training, fit testing, and maintenance and use 
requirements (https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.
show_document?p_id=12716&p_table=STANDARDS).
The findings in this report are subject to at least four limita-
tions. First, in this analysis, only patients undergoing treatment 
at a single tertiary care center specializing in IPF treatment were 
identified, which might have led to an overrepresentation of 
dentists, given their comparatively high socioeconomic status. 
Conversely, dental personnel in Virginia and the surrounding 
region undergoing IPF treatment at other facilities during this 
same time frame were not identified, thereby potentially under-
representing the magnitude of this cluster. Second, only one 
patient completed an interview, limiting the ability to explore 
past occupational exposures. Third, multiple patients had 
reported exposures that occurred outside of work and that are 
known risk factors for IPF, including tobacco smoke and dust 
(2). Finally, no biopsy specimens were available for examina-
tion to assess histological commonalities among the patients.
This investigation revealed the first described cluster of 
dental personnel with diagnosed IPF. The eight dentists iden-
tified in this cluster exceeded the number of expected cases, 
consistent with National Occupational Respiratory Mortality 
System data regarding IPF mortality and the proportion of 
U.S. residents who are dentists. Dentists and other dental 
personnel experience unique occupational exposures, including 
exposure to infectious organisms, dusts, gases, and fumes. It is 
possible that occupational exposures contributed to this cluster. 
After this analysis, another IPF case was diagnosed in a dentist 
treated at this specialty clinic. Further investigation of the risk 
for dental personnel and IPF is warranted to develop strategies 
for prevention of potentially harmful exposures.
