In Brief
Flint and Janowitz et al. reveal the
intricate links between cancer cachexia,
hepatic metabolism, and tumor
immunology. They find that tumor-
induced IL-6 suppresses hepatic
ketogenesis, and during caloric
deficiency, this triggers marked
glucocorticoid secretion. This hormonal
stress response suppresses intratumoral
immunity and causes failure of anti-
cancer immunotherapy.

SUMMARY
In patients with cancer, the wasting syndrome,
cachexia, is associated with caloric deficiency.
Here, we describe tumor-induced alterations of the
host metabolic response to caloric deficiency that
cause intratumoral immune suppression. In pre-
cachectic mice with transplanted colorectal cancer
or autochthonous pancreatic ductal adenocarci-
noma
(PDA),
we
find
that
IL-6
reduces
the
hepatic ketogenic potential through suppression of
PPARalpha, the transcriptional master regulator of
ketogenesis. When these mice are challenged with
caloric deficiency, the resulting relative hypoke-
tonemia triggers a marked rise in glucocorticoid
levels. Multiple intratumoral immune pathways are
suppressed
by
this
hormonal stress
response.
Moreover, administering corticosterone to elevate
plasma corticosterone to a level that is lower than
that occurring in cachectic mice abolishes the
response of mouse PDA to an immunotherapy that
has advanced to clinical trials. Therefore, tumor-
induced IL-6 impairs the ketogenic response to
reduced caloric intake, resulting in a systemic
metabolic stress response that blocks anti-cancer
immunotherapy.
INTRODUCTION
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a leading cause of
cancer death (Siegel et al., 2012). It is poorly responsive to avail-
able chemotherapies and unresponsive to checkpoint-targeted
immunotherapies (Brahmer et al., 2012; Royal et al., 2010), and
it predisposes patients to the lethal wasting syndrome, cachexia
(Bachmann et al., 2013). Resistance to chemotherapy and im-
mune evasion are topics of active research in PDA (Feig et al.,
2013; Olive et al., 2009), but how PDA tumors alter host meta-
bolism in cachexia and whether this affects the host’s immune
interaction with the tumor are less studied questions.
Cachexia, which is clinically defined by weight loss, repre-
sents a spectrum of disease. It initially arises as pre-cachexia,
progresses to cachexia, and then progresses to refractory
cachexia, a process that is driven by negative energy balance
and abnormal metabolism (Fearon et al., 2011). The pathogen-
esis and progression of cachexia have been attributed in part
to systemic elevations of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Fearon
et al., 2012), but anti-cytokine therapies alone have not demon-
strated clinical benefit. Cachexia-enhancing alterations such as
increased catabolic signaling and increased uncoupling protein
expression have also been described at the level of muscle
and fat tissues, respectively (Kir et al., 2014; Petruzzelli et al.,
2014; Zhou et al., 2010). It is not known, however, whether the
normal host response to caloric deficiency, a central component
of the syndrome (Fearon et al., 2011), is itself impaired in
cachexia. Such an impairment might explain why macronutrient
supplementation has failed to reverse cachexia in clinical trials
(Tisdale, 2009).
Altered macronutrient utilization must also be considered in
the context of tumor biology and therapeutic resistance. Previ-
ous studies have highlighted the capacity of cancer cells to
respond to alterations of the host metabolism (Kalaany and Sa-
batini, 2009; Park et al., 2010), but the stromal constituents of the
tumor may also sense such alterations. One possibility, consid-
ering the sensitivity of intratumoral T cells to their local metabolic
environment (Chang et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2015), as well as the
marked effects of poor nutritional status on systemic immunity
in other contexts (Keusch and Farthing, 1986), is a suppressive
effect of cachexia on the T cell-mediated anti-tumor immune re-
action. Such an effect could contribute to the failure of patients
with PDA to respond to the current generation of T cell check-
point targeted immunotherapies.
In the present study, we have examined the interactions
between cancer, systemic metabolism, and tumor immunology
in mice using two cancer types that have been documented
to predispose to cachexia, the transplanted C26 model of
colorectal cancer (Tanaka et al., 1990) and the genetically
engineered, autochthonous LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+;

RESULTS
Reprogrammed Hepatic Metabolism Is Evident in Pre-
cachectic and Cachectic Mice
C26 and PDA tumors cause cachexia, as defined by loss of
body weight (Figures 1A, S1A, and S1B, available online),
depletion of fat and muscle mass (Figures S1D and S1F), and
elevated markers of muscle catabolism (Figures S1E and S1G).
In both model systems, we observed that cachexia was associ-
ated with decreased food intake (Figures 1B and S1C). The
cachexia-associated reduction in food intake was more pro-
nounced in PDA-bearing relative to C26-bearing mice despite
similar rates of weight loss, possibly reflecting differences in tu-
mor size, tumor metabolic activity, and/or murine activity levels.
Given the relevance of reduced food intake to cachexia (Fearon
et al., 2011), we examined more closely the response to reduced
food intake in the C26 and PDA systems. In order to avoid the
confounding effects of differing food intake patterns that are
well documented as a problem of pair-feeding experiments (Ella-
cott et al., 2010), we subjected weight-stable, pre-cachectic
C26- and PDA-bearing mice, and the respective non-tumor-
bearing littermate control mice, to 24 hr total food restriction
(TFR) (Figures S1H and S1I). We measured endocrine markers
and metabolites in all experimental groups (Figures 1C–1E and
S2A–S2D). Cachectic and food-restricted pre-cachectic C26-
and PDA-bearing mice had lower plasma glucose and ketone
levels relative to food-restricted non-tumor-bearing controls
(Figures 1C, 1D, and S2C). Metabolic stress, as measured by
plasma levels of corticosterone, occurred in all food-restricted
and cachectic mice (Figure 1E), but the highest corticosterone
levels were observed in the food-restricted pre-cachectic
groups, presumably in response to low levels of ketones and
glucose (Figures 1C–1E, S2C, and S2D) (Amiel et al., 1991).
Low levels of ketones and raised glucocorticoid levels during
periods of continuous weight loss are not restricted to mouse

Weight-stable mice with established C26 or PDA
tumors that were yet to develop cachexia were
termed
pre-cachectic
(C26/PreCx
and
PDA/
PreCx, respectively). C26- and PDA-bearing mice
were termed cachectic (C26/Cx and PDA/Cx,
respectively) following >5% body weight loss from
their peak weight.
(A and B) Body weight (A) and cumulative food
intake (B) were monitored in C26/PreCx, C26/Cx,
PDA/PreCx, and PDA/Cx mice, and measure-
ments were aligned to the time of sacrifice.
(C–E) Terminal bleed plasma levels of (C) glucose
and (D) ketones and tail bleed plasma levels of (E)
corticosterone were assessed in littermates (LM),
C26/PreCx and C26/Cx mice, and LM and C26/
PreCx mice that had been subjected to 24 hr TFR
(LM + TFR and C26/PreCx + TFR, respectively).
Parallel assessments were performed in PDA-
bearing mice, with LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1-Cre/+
(PC) mice as the non-tumor-bearing controls.

cachectic and cachectic patients with pancreatic

LM, C26/PreCx, and C26/Cx mice, and for PC,
PDA/PreCx, and PDA/Cx mice, were performed
using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for
post hoc testing. The LM + TFR versus C26/
PreCx + TFR, PC + TFR versus PDA/PreCx + TFR,
and pre-cachectic versus cachectic patient com-
parisons were each performed separately using
two-tailed t tests with Welch’s correction.

 models of cancer, for they were also present in patients with PDA
and cachexia (Figures 1F, 1G, S1J, and S1K).
Ketogenesis occurs in the liver and depends on the tran-
scription factor PPARalpha, as demonstrated by the severely
impaired ketogenesis in mice with a germline deletion of the
Ppara gene (Kersten et al., 1999). Hepatic Ppara mRNA levels
were significantly lower in pre-cachectic C26- and PDA-bearing
mice than in non-tumor-bearing control mice. They were further
decreased in both cachectic and food-restricted pre-cachectic
C26- and PDA-bearing mice, but not in the food-restricted
non-tumor-bearing control groups (Figure 2A). Hepatic mRNA
levels for Acadm and Hmgsc2, target genes of PPARalpha (Man-
dard et al., 2004), were significantly decreased in all tumor-
bearing mice that exhibited suppression of Ppara mRNA (Figures
2B and 2C). The products of these genes mediate the mitochon-
drial beta oxidation and conversion to ketones of the free fatty
acids that have been released from adipose tissues during
caloric deprivation. Their relatively diminished level of expres-
sion may therefore explain the low ketone levels that we
observed in cachectic mice and food-restricted pre-cachectic
mice. Impaired ketogenic potential in food-restricted pre-
cachectic C26- and PDA-bearing mice was confirmed by the
significantly reduced blood ketone levels following intraperito-
neal (i.p.) administration of the ketogenic substrate, octanoate
(McGarry and Foster, 1971), as compared to the ketone levels
in the food-restricted non-tumor-bearing control groups (Fig-
ure 2D). Food-restricted PDA-bearing mice also exhibited
reduced blood glucose in response to octanoate challenge rela-
tive to their control group (Figure S2E). These experiments do not
exclude an additional contribution to fasting hypoketonemia by
the depletion of adipose tissues, which was particularly pro-
nounced in the cachectic relative to the food-restricted pre-
cachectic groups (Figures S1D, S1F, and S1I), but they corre-
spond directly to findings from models of PPARalpha deletion
and hepatic PPARalpha dysfunction (Chakravarthy et al., 2005;
Kersten et al., 1999; Sengupta et al., 2010). Taken together,
these findings demonstrate that the ketogenic potential of the
liver is impaired in pre-cachectic mice, most likely because of
suppressed Ppara expression, and that this tumor-induced
metabolic reprogramming exacerbates metabolic stress during
subsequent periods of caloric deficiency.
IL-6 Is Necessary and Sufficient to Suppress Hepatic
Ketogenesis in Pre-cachectic Mice
To investigate the mechanistic basis of tumor-induced suppres-
sion of hepatic Ppara and ketogenesis, we first performed a
screen of tumor-associated cytokines and chemokines in the
plasma of C26- and PDA-bearing mice. Given that the tumor-
induced suppression of hepatic Ppara and ketogenesis was
observed even in pre-cachectic C26- and PDA-bearing mice
(Figures 2A–2D), we reasoned that the tumor-associated cyto-
kine that accounted for these effects would be elevated in both
pre-cachectic and cachectic mice from each model system. Of
the cytokines that we screened, only IL-6 fulfilled this criterion
(Figures 3A and S3A–S3C). Although TNFa was elevated in
pre-cachectic and cachectic mice with PDA, plasma levels of
this cytokine were unchanged in mice bearing C26 tumors. We
also observed significantly elevated IL-6 levels in pre-cachectic
and cachectic patients with PDA (Figure 3B). Importantly,
this observation is consistent with the data from C26- and

(A–C) mRNA expression levels of (A) Ppara, (B)
Acadm, and (C) Hmgcs2 genes involved in mito-
chondrial beta-oxidation and ketogenesis were
measured via qRT-PCR in livers taken from LM,
C26/PreCx, C26/Cx, LM + TFR, C26/PreCx + TFR,
PC, PDA/PreCx, PDA/Cx, PC + TFR, and PDA/
PreCx + TFR mice. All measurements were
normalized to the respective freely feeding non-
tumor-bearing control groups.

TFR, C26/PreCx + TFR, PC + TFR, and PDA/
PreCx + TFR mice in vivo by administration of so-
dium octanoate 24 hr post-TFR. Blood ketone
concentrations were measured for up to 180 min
post-substrate administration (n = 7–12 per group).
The comparisons between LM, C26/PreCx, and
C26/Cx mice, and between PC, PDA/PreCx, and
PDA/Cx mice, were performed using one-way
ANOVA with Tukey’s correction for post hoc
testing. Comparisons between LM + TFR and C26/
PreCx + TFR mice, and between PC + TFR and
PDA/PreCx + TFR mice, were performed using
two-tailed t tests with Welch’s correction.

 PDA-bearing mice outlined above (Figure 3A), as well as with
previous reports of elevated IL-6 levels in patients with PDA
and with other cachexia-associated cancers (Staal-van den Bre-
kel et al., 1995; Fearon et al., 1991; Okada et al., 1998).
To determine whether IL-6 contributed to the regulation of he-
patic Ppara expression and ketogenesis, we infused recombi-
nant IL-6 or PBS into non-tumor-bearing littermate mice for
72 hr, with the highest rate of infusion achieving plasma IL-6
levels comparable to those occurring in pre-cachectic and
cachectic C26- and PDA-bearing mice (Figure 3C). During the
final 24 hr, we subjected the mice to TFR. The recombinant
IL-6 dose-dependently suppressed hepatic mRNA levels for
Ppara, Acadm, and Hmgcs2 and lowered fasting glucose
and ketone levels while elevating fasting corticosterone levels
(Figures 3D–3F). These changes were observed in the absence
of IL-6-dependent alterations in body weight kinetics, body
composition, and changes in pre-fasting plasma corticosterone
levels (Figures S3D–S3F).
We then determined whether the elevated IL-6 in tumor-
bearing mice accounted for the suppression of hepatic Ppara
and ketogenesis by administering neutralizing anti-IL-6 antibody
to pre-cachectic mice with C26 tumors for 72 hr, during which
TFR was imposed for the final 24 hr. Anti-IL-6 administration
partially restored not only the hepatic mRNA levels of Ppara,
Acadm, and Hmgcs2, but also the ketogenic response to the

octanoate challenge (Figures 4A and
4B). These changes were also associated
with an improved metabolic response to
fasting, as reflected by the normalized plasma levels of glucose,
ketones, and corticosterone (Figures 4C and 4D). Anti-IL-6
administration did not change body weight kinetics, body
composition, tumor growth, serum markers of hepatocellular
damage, or pre-fasting food intake (Figures S4A–S4G).
The results from the above experiments clarify some important
aspects underlying the suppression of hepatic ketogenesis and
elevated corticosterone levels observed in our pre-cachectic
model systems following food restriction. The reduced ketogen-
esis cannot be ascribed to reduced fat stores (Figures S1D, S1F,
and S1I) because both gain- and loss-of-function experiments
involving IL-6 were performed with mice that were initially
matched for fat stores, and there were no IL-6-dependent alter-
ations of fat mass (Figures S3E and S4E). Likewise, although IL-6
has previously been reported as a direct activator of the hypo-
thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (Wang and Dunn, 1998), this
mechanism cannot account for the corticosterone elevations
that were observed in the C26 and PDA model systems under
food restriction (Figure 1E). Pre-cachectic C26- and PDA-
bearing mice exhibited normal corticosterone levels despite
raised IL-6 levels (Figures 1E and 3A), and IL-6 infusion did not
elevate corticosterone in the absence of food restriction (Fig-
ure S3F). Taken together, these data support the conclusion
that tumor-induced IL-6 is both necessary and sufficient to sup-
press the potential of the liver for ketogenesis. This metabolic

 switch, however, does not affect glucocorticoid levels until
the imposition of caloric deficiency, where hepatic ketogenesis
is required to support the energy demands of the brain (Cahill,
2006). The circumstance of caloric deficiency leads to the meta-
bolic stress that induces the marked glucocorticoid response
(Figures 1E, 3F, and 4D).
Tumor-Induced Metabolic Stress Is Coupled with
Suppressed Intratumoral Immunity
We addressed the possibility that the cachexia-associated alter-
ations of host metabolism (Figures 1, 2, S1, and S2) might affect
tumor biology by comparing the transcriptomes of C26 tumors
taken from pre-cachectic and cachectic mice. Unsupervised
analysis of the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data distinguished
the tumors taken from pre-cachectic and cachectic C26-bearing
mice (Figure S5A), and between-group comparisons yielded
2,973 differentially expressed genes at a false discovery rate
(FDR) < 0.05 (Figure S5B). Downregulation in the tumors from
cachectic mice was the dominant phenomenon, and of the 30
most downregulated pathways identified by a gene set enrich-

ment analysis (GSEA) (FDR % 0.001 for
each of the 30 pathways), 29 were related
to either innate or adaptive immunity (Fig-
ure 5A). No significantly upregulated path-
ways (FDR < 0.25) were identified by
the analysis. A MetaCore enrichment anal-
ysis yielded similar results (Figures S5C
and S5E). A review of the list of differen-
tially expressed genes indicated that the
dominant pathway alterations resulted
from reduction of multiple immune cell
types, including the CD4+, CD8+, and
natural killer (NK) lymphocyte populations,
in
C26
tumors
from
cachectic
mice
(Table S1). Also reduced were transcripts for molecules involved
in lymphocyte chemotaxis (Cxcl9–11), and CD4+ Th1 and CD8+
T cell effector function (Ifng, Gzmb, and Prf1). The myeloid
compartment was also affected in these C26 tumors from
cachectic mice, as demonstrated by a decrease in the levels of
transcripts for Itgam, Itgax, and Cd74 (CD11b, CD11c, and MHC
II, respectively) (Table S1). The cachexia-associated depletion of
intratumoral CD3+ T cells was confirmed by immunohistochem-
istry (Figure S5D). Flow cytometric analysis using markers for
lymphoid cells was performed on C26 tumors from independent
cohorts of pre-cachectic and cachectic mice (Figures 5B and
S5F). In addition to the cachexia-associated loss of CD3+
T cells, this analysis demonstrated the depletion of CD8+ T cells,
CD4+Foxp3� T cells, and NK cells. A trend toward reduced
numbers of CD4+Foxp3+ T cells was also observed (Figure 5B).
We determined whether the immunological phenotype of C26
tumors taken from cachectic mice could be induced by food re-
striction of pre-cachectic C26-bearing mice. Since adaptive im-
mune control of tumor growth depends on the intratumoral accu-
mulation and function of T cells (Mikucki et al., 2015; Tumeh
676
Cell Metabolism 24, 672–684, November 8, 2016
 et al., 2014), we measured the expression of a panel of eight
genes relating to these immune phenomena that were sup-
pressed in tumors from cachectic mice: the CXCR3-dependent
chemotaxis of T cells (Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Cxcl11), the presence
of T cells (Cd8a and Cd3e), and their effector functions (Gzmb,
Prf1, and Ifng). Food-restricted pre-cachectic C26-bearing
mice exhibited reductions in the expression of this immune
gene panel that were similar to those that were observed in
cachectic C26-bearing mice (Figures 5C and 5D). Forty percent
partial food restriction, relative to baseline food intake, of pre-
cachectic C26-bearing mice also induced metabolic stress, as
reported by elevated plasma corticosterone levels; suppressed
the expression of the selected immunological genes; and
reduced the numbers of intratumoral CD3+ T cells relative to
ad libitum-fed pre-cachectic C26-bearing mice (Figures 5E and
S6A–S6E). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the

experimentally induced, in C26-bearing mice suppresses intra-

Glucocorticoids, Induced by Metabolic Stress, Suppress
Intratumoral Immunity
The cachexia-associated phenotypes of reprogrammed hepatic
metabolism with metabolic stress (Figures 1, 2, 3, and 4) and
suppressed intratumoral immunity (Figures 5 and S5) were
both induced by food restriction of pre-cachectic mice. We
considered the possibility that the two responses were linked

by the marked stress-induced elevations
in glucocorticoids (Figures 1E, 3F, 4D,
and S2D) because glucocorticoids are
clinically used as potent pharmacological
immune suppressants. We first assessed
whether the immune gene panel of the
C26 tumor in freely feeding pre-cachectic
mice
was
sensitive
to
physiological,
diurnal variation in plasma corticosterone
levels. Expression of six of the eight
genes in the panel was significantly lower
in C26 tumors taken at 1700 hr, as
compared to their expression in tumors taken at 0900 hr, which
correlated with the peak and nadir, respectively, of the plasma
corticosterone levels (Figures 6A and 6B). The possibility that
these immune changes reflected a marked sensitivity of the
C26 tumor microenvironment to corticosterone was examined
by implanting subcutaneous pellets continuously releasing corti-
costerone at 0.01 mg/hr for 7 days in C26-bearing mice, which
resulted in plasma corticosterone levels at 0900 and 1700 hr
that were equivalent to the peak diurnal level (Figure 6B). This
modest alteration in physiological corticosterone levels was
sufficient to induce the phenotype of cachexia-associated

 intratumoral immune suppression when assessed transcription-
ally and histologically (Figures 6C and S6F). Increasing the corti-
costerone pellet release to 0.02 mg/hr dose dependently led to
higher plasma corticosterone levels (354.5 ± 17.7 ng/mL SEM)
but did not further suppress the expression of the immune
gene panel or the intratumoral CD3+ T cell percentages (Figures
6C and S6F). Flow cytometric analysis of tumors from an inde-
pendent cohort of C26-bearing mice that were implanted with
the 0.01 mg/hr corticosterone pellets confirmed depletion of
CD3+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+Foxp3� T cells, CD4+Foxp3+
T cells, and NK cells (Figure S6G). This marked sensitivity of the
immune C26 tumor microenvironment to corticosterone was
also reflected by the correlation between anti-IL-6-induced
decreased plasma levels of the hormone and increased mRNA
levels of Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and Cxcl11 in food-restricted pre-
cachectic C26-bearing mice (Figure S6H).
These experiments demonstrating the sensitivity of the
immune microenvironment of the C26 tumors to changes in
corticosterone levels did not exclude the possibility that other
consequences of caloric deficiency and metabolic stress in tu-
mor-bearing mice might contribute to immune suppression.
To evaluate this possibility, pre-cachectic C26-bearing mice
that were subjected to 24 hr TFR were administered the
glucocorticoid synthesis inhibitor, aminoglutethimide, or vehicle
control. Relative to freely feeding controls, the food-restricted,
vehicle-treated group exhibited elevated plasma corticosterone
levels, reduced expression of the intratumoral immune panel of
genes, and fewer intratumoral T cells and NK cells (Figures
6D–6F and S7A). Trends toward fewer CD4+Foxp3� T cells
and CD4+Foxp3+ T cells were also observed (Figure 6F). Amino-
glutethimide inhibited the fasting-induced corticosterone pro-
duction (Figure 6D) and all changes relating to intratumoral im-
munity (Figures 6E, 6F, and S7A), despite a further reduction
in blood glucose levels (Figure S7B). These findings indicate
that elevated corticosterone is the primary metabolic mediator
of intratumoral immune suppression during caloric deficiency
in pre-cachectic tumor-bearing mice.
Stress-Induced Glucocorticoids Cause Failure of
Cancer Immunotherapy
Human PDA has not responded to therapy with antagonists of
T cell checkpoints (Brahmer et al., 2012; Royal et al., 2010),
and the mouse model of this disease is also resistant to anti-
bodies specific for PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4 (Feig et al., 2013;
Zhu et al., 2014). Consistent with this lack of response of PDA
to stimulators of T cell function, and consistent with the low
numbers of intratumoral T cells predicting failure of immuno-
therapy (Tumeh et al., 2014), are the markedly lower levels of in-
tratumoral transcripts relating to T cell immunity in pre-cachectic
PDA-bearing mice as compared to their levels in pre-cachectic
C26-bearing mice (Figure 7A). We examined whether this con-
trasting immune microenvironment also exhibited sensitivity to
metabolic stress. Subjecting pre-cachectic PDA-bearing mice
to 24 hr of TFR reduced expression of Cxcl9 and Gzmb, with
trends toward reduced expression for Cxcl10 and Ifng (Fig-
ure 7A). Continuously elevating corticosterone levels in PDA-
bearing mice for 6 days using a 0.02 mg/hr corticosterone
infusion also suppressed the expression of Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and

(Figures 7B and 7C).
The potential clinical relevance of the sensitivity of the im-
mune microenvironment of mouse PDA to glucocorticoids
was assessed by examining the effect of elevated corticoste-
rone levels on immunotherapy in this model. Pre-clinical exper-
iments have demonstrated T cell-dependent control of PDA
growth in mice receiving the selective CXCR4 antagonist,
AMD3100,
in
combination
with
anti-PD-L1
(Feig
et
al.,
2013). We treated freely feeding, weight-stable pre-cachectic
PDA-bearing mice for 6 days with a continuous infusion of
AMD3100 or PBS, in combination with anti-PD-L1 or isotype
control antibody, in the context of subcutaneous pellets
releasing corticosterone at a rate of 0.02 mg/hr or placebo
control pellets. In mice with control pellets, this immunotherapy
arrested PDA growth (Figure 7D). In contrast, in mice with corti-
costerone-releasing pellets that resulted in elevated plasma
levels of the hormone, which were lower than those of
cachectic or food-restricted pre-cachectic PDA-bearing mice
(Figure 7C) and comparable to the fold elevations observed
in human cachexia (Figure 1G), this immunotherapy failed to
control PDA growth (Figure 7E). AMD3100 plasma levels were
comparable in the placebo and corticosterone-infused groups
(1,020 ± 63.0 ng/mL SEM versus 1,310 ± 161 ng/mL SEM,
respectively). Through infusion of glucocorticoids at doses
that are relevant both physiologically and clinically, we have
thus demonstrated a direct link between the tumor-induced
alteration in the metabolic response to caloric deprivation and
failure of PDA tumors to respond to immunotherapy.
DISCUSSION
We have demonstrated in two mouse models of cancer-induced
cachexia that in pre-cachectic mice, even before the onset of
the weight-losing phase of the syndrome, tumor-induced IL-6
has altered the capacity of the liver to respond to caloric
deprivation. Through a suppression of ketogenesis that is attrib-
utable to suppression of its transcriptional master regulator,
PPARalpha, this tumor-induced reprogramming of hepatic
metabolism has removed an important component of the host’s
capacity to make available endogenous sources of energy that
compensate for decreased caloric intake. This compounding of
the energy deficit magnifies the host stress response and leads
to glucocorticoid levels that are more than sufficient to suppress
tumor immunity, especially when considering the sensitivity of
the immune tumor microenvironment even to diurnal variations
of
the
hormone.
This
apparently
paradoxical
metabolic
response to caloric deficiency may subvert therapeutic inter-
ventions designed to correct other causes of the failure of tumor
immune surveillance, such as poor immunogenicity and local
immune privilege (Joyce and Fearon, 2015; Le et al., 2015;
Zelenay et al., 2015). The translational relevance of our study
is emphasized by validation of all key aspects of the metabolic
and immunological phenotypes, and performance of the im-
mune therapy experiment, in the KPC autochthonous PDA
model, which recapitulates human PDA and is the accepted
model for pre-clinical studies of this cancer (Mayers et al.,
2014; Rhim et al., 2014). In addition, this study demonstrates,
in accordance with our murine data, that some patients with
pancreatic cancer exhibit raised IL-6 levels when they are pre-
cachectic, and that they may exhibit the triad of raised IL-6
levels, reduced ketone levels, and raised glucocorticoid levels
when they are cachectic.
The finding that tumor-induced IL-6 suppresses PPARalpha-
regulated ketogenesis was confirmed mechanistically, in vivo,
through both gain- and loss-of-function studies (Figures 3C–
3F, 4A–4D, S3D–S3F, and S4A–S4G). This ketogenic deficit
was shown to be independent of decreased fat mass (Figures
S3E and S4E) and, importantly, to be induced by infusing IL-6
in the absence of a tumor (Figures 3C–3F). The mechanism
whereby IL-6 impinged upon the expression of PPARalpha in
the liver is not addressed by our study, although as PPARalpha
regulates its own transcription (Mandard et al., 2004), sup-
pressed expression may relate to deprivation of the physiolog-
ical ligand for PPARalpha (Chakravarthy et al., 2005) or repres-
sion of the peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE)
(Sengupta et al., 2010). The finding that tumor-induced IL-6
was both necessary and sufficient to suppress hepatic ketogen-
esis, taken together with the fact that consistent elevations of
other cytokines were not detected in our model systems, indi-
cates that the effects on hepatic metabolism of other cytokines
are less relevant in this metabolic context. Finally, we have not
addressed the possibility that the fatty acids that are liberated
from adipose tissue and not readily metabolized by reprog-
rammed livers may be a source of macronutrients to be used
by cancer cells for growth (Kamphorst et al., 2013). Neverthe-
less, the observation of tumor-induced IL-6 reprogramming
hepatic ketogenesis, when taken together with the recent report
of lung cancer rewiring hepatic circadian homeostasis involving
insulin, glucose, and lipid metabolism (Masri et al., 2016), sug-
gests that the liver may be a specific target of tumor-induced
effects on the host, presumably for the benefit of the tumor
and the detriment of the host.
The results relating to hepatic metabolism alone may have
multiple clinical implications. Hepatic ketone body production
is essential in order to spare glucose and support brain function
during periods of caloric insufficiency (Cahill, 2006). The re-
sponses of blood ketones and glucose in fasted pre-cachectic
mice to the exogenous fatty acid substrate, octanoate, were di-
rectionally opposed relative to the responses of non-tumor-
bearing controls (Figures 2D and S2E), indicating severely
compromised nutrient processing, and perhaps explaining why
conventional nutritional support has so far been ineffective in
cachectic cancer patients (Tisdale, 2009). Such aberrant liver
metabolism may not be limited to the context of cancer: the he-
patic effect of IL-6 in tumor-free mice is dose dependent across
the range observed in tumor-bearing mice (Figures 3A, 3C, and
3D), implicating the process in a wide range of IL-6-associated
diseases where weight loss is observed, such as sepsis, HIV,
tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiac
failure, and rheumatoid arthritis. In terms of therapeutic revers-
ibility, our body composition data following acute IL-6 neutraliza-
tion are consistent with existing clinical data regarding the failure
of anti-IL-6 to improve wasting parameters in cachectic patients
without concomitant correction of caloric deficiencies (Fearon
et al., 2012). When taken with the more subtle effects on meta-
bolism, and in particular the rescue of the octanoate response
(Figure 4B), these data suggest that successful reversal of
680
Cell Metabolism 24, 672–684, November 8, 2016
 cachexia may require co-administration of anti-IL-6 with nutri-
tional support.
In the context of caloric deficiency, where ketogenesis is nor-
mally activated to provide energy substrates that are essential
to support brain function (Cahill, 2006), IL-6-induced metabolic
reprogramming leads directly to the phenotype of glucocorti-
coid-induced immune suppression within the tumor micro-
environment. Initially observed in an unbiased comparison of
the transcriptomes of the C26 tumors in cachectic and pre-
cachectic mice, and then shown to be a consequence of the
compensatory glucocorticoid response to caloric deficiency,
this immunological phenotype exhibited an internally consistent
cluster of findings: decreased levels of Cxcl9, Cxcl10, and
Cxcl11 mRNA in association with fewer lymphocytes and
diminished mRNA levels of the lymphocyte effector genes,
Ifng, Gzmb, and Prf1 (Figures 5A–5E, 6A–6F, S6A–S6G, and
S7A). We focused our attention on these markers because
CXCR3 signaling is required for T cell infiltration into tumor sites
(Mikucki et al., 2015), and the relative intensity of intratumoral
T cell infiltration predicts both cancer survival and the response
to anti-cancer immunotherapy in humans (Galon et al., 2006;
Rooney et al., 2015; Tumeh et al., 2014). The transcriptional
findings were recapitulated in the PDA model system (Figures
7A and 7B). Glucocorticoid sensitivity was thus observed in tu-
mor immune microenvironments with high and low levels of
immunological activity. This is translationally relevant because
tumors from patients with cancer exhibit a wide spectrum of
immunological activity (Rooney et al., 2015). Among the many
potential mechanisms mediating the immunosuppressive ef-
fects of glucocorticoids, the diminished expression of Cxcl9–
11 suggests that the most relevant cellular target of the
elevated glucocorticoids may be the intratumoral myelomono-
cytic cell. Deletion of NR3C1, the glucocorticoid receptor, in
these cells has been shown to abolish glucocorticoid-depen-
dent suppression of the expression of Cxcl10 and other chemo-
tactic factors in a contact hypersensitivity reaction (Tucker-
mann et al., 2007).
A potential biological role for this metabolic pathway may be
to suppress immunological damage to inflamed, non-infected
tissues since many inflammatory conditions are associated
with anorexia, high IL-6 levels, and elevated serum glucocorti-
coids. In the context of inflammation associated with cancer,
however, this metabolic pathway subverts the host’s capacity
to mediate immune control of the cancer. Providing exogenous
corticosterone in freely feeding pre-cachectic PDA-bearing
mice isolated the effects of this hormone from other alterations
associated with cachexia, thereby permitting an evaluation of its
effects on anti-tumor immunotherapy. Corticosterone levels that
were below the range observed in cachectic or food-restricted
pre-cachectic mice were sufficient to abolish the anti-tumor ef-
fect of dual CXCR4 and PD-L1 antagonism in mice bearing
autochthonous PDA (Figures 7C–7E). Cachexia is a frequent
occurrence in human pancreatic cancer (Bachmann et al.,
2013), associated with fold elevations of glucocorticoids that
are comparable to those achieved during the corticosterone
infusions (Figures 1G, 6B, and 7C), and known to be revers-
ible upon tumor shrinkage or removal (Fearon et al., 2013;
Strassmann et al., 1992). These observations, together with
the recently initiated clinical trials involving CXCR4 antagonism
with or without co-targeting of the PD-1:PD-L1 axis in PDA
(NCT02179970; NCT02472977), attest to the clinical relevance
of our findings.
In conclusion, we have unveiled a new aspect of how
metabolism in tumor-bearing hosts is reprogrammed in the
pre-cachectic state. Such metabolic dysregulation can ulti-
mately lead to failure of host immunity to control cancer in the
context of anti-cancer immunotherapy. Prior resolution of
such deranged metabolism through a combination of IL-6
neutralization and hyperalimentation may be necessary in order
to maximize the proportion of patients that respond to these
therapies. Rescue of immunotherapeutic efficacy may also
be achieved in a more direct manner, through inhibition of
glucocorticoid synthesis. In turn, glucocorticoid levels them-
selves may be of use as biomarkers in the context of immuno-
therapy. Future clinical studies of both cachexia-modulating
interventions and anti-cancer immune therapies may need to
take these findings into consideration in order to optimize the
selection of therapeutic combinations and the discovery of
biomarkers.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Full experimental procedures are provided in the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
Animal Experiments
All experiments were performed in accordance with national and institutional
guidelines and approved by the UK Home Office, the animal ethics committee
of Cancer Research UK Cambridge Institute, and the University of Cambridge.
The C26 model experiments were performed on wild-type male BALB/c mice,
which were kept on a 24 hr 12:12 light-dark cycle and inoculated with 2*106
viable cells subcutaneously (s.c.). Mice were termed pre-cachectic from
18 days post-inoculation. Cachexia was defined as >5% loss from peak
body weight.
PDA was detected via ultrasound in KPC mice. Mice with maximum average
PDA tumor diameters >4 mm were defined as pre-cachectic.
i.p. injections were administered as follows: anti-IL-6 (MP5.20F3) and
isotype IgG1 (HRPN) at 48 hr prior to and at the point of TFR (1.25 mg per
injection); sodium octanoate at 24 hr post-TFR (6 mL/kg of 200 mM); aminoglu-
tethimide at 0, 8, and 16 hr post-TFR (37.5 mg/kg per injection); and anti-PD-L1
on days 0, 2, and 4 (200 mg per injection). Corticosterone or placebo pellets
and osmotic minipumps loaded with AMD3100, recombinant IL-6, or PBS
were implanted s.c.
Murine Blood and Plasma Measurements
Blood samples were kept on ice. Plasma and tissues were snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at �80�C. Tail bleeds were analyzed for glucose and ke-
tone concentrations using gluco- and ketometers. Corticosterone was quanti-
fied using ELISA. Terminal cardiac bleed plasma glucose and ketone levels
were assessed using the Siemens Dimension RxL analyzer and the Stanbio
Beta Hydroxybutyrate Liquicolor kit, respectively. Insulin, leptin, and cytokines
were measured using MesoScale Discovery kits. IL-6 levels were measured
using ELISA.
AMD3100 was extracted from plasma samples pre-spiked with internal
standard (D4-labeled AMD3100) and EDTA by protein precipitation with meth-
anol. Quantitation was by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) over a calibration range of 50–5,000 ng/mL.
qRT-PCR
mRNA was extracted from snap-frozen tissues using TRIzol Reagent. mRNA
templates were diluted to 2 ng/mL (muscle and liver) or 30 ng/mL (tumor) and
analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. mRNA levels were normalized to
either Rn18s (liver and tumor) or Tbp (quadriceps) using the ddCt method.
Cell Metabolism 24, 672–684, November 8, 2016
681
 RNA-Seq
RNA extracted from frozen tissues via TRIzol was run through QIAGEN
RNeasy columns following the ‘‘RNA cleanup’’ protocol. Integrity was
confirmed using RIN values with a cut-off of 8, and libraries were prepared us-
ing the Illumina TruSeq mRNA Stranded Sample prep kit (96 index high
throughput) using twelve rounds of PCR. Libraries were quantity and quality
checked and normalized. The final pooled library was run on a MiSeq to
assess final sequencing quality before HiSeq 2500 V4 single-end 50 bp
sequencing. We aimed to generate 10–20 M single-end 50 bp reads per
sample.
For the analysis, single-end 50 bp reads were aligned to the mouse
genome version GRCm38.74 using TopHat v2.0.4. Read counts were ob-
tained using HTSeq-count v0.5.3p9. Read counts were normalized and
tested for differential gene expression using the Bioconductor package
DESeq v1.10.1. Multiple testing correction was applied using the Benja-
mini-Hochberg method. The data can be accessed at http://dx.doi.org/10.
17863/CAM.4930.
GSEA was performed by ranking all genes tested in RNA-seq using –log10
(p values) derived from differential expression analyses and testing against
MSigDB Canonical Pathways (C2:CP). MetaCore enrichment analyses gated
on the significantly (FDR < 0.05) up- and downregulated genes were also per-
formed using MetaCore’s pathway maps database.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissues were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formaldehyde. Immunohisto-
chemistry was performed for CD3 using a Leica Bond III immunostainer.
Deparaffinization and rehydration were conducted before antigen retrieval
was performed using Tris EDTA (pH 9) (ER2) for 20 min at 100�C, incubation
in a rabbit polyclonal anti-CD3 antibody (A0452) for 15 min, HRP-linked
anti-rabbit polymer for 8 min, diaminobenzidine for 10 min, and DAB
Enhancer (Leica) for 10 min. Counterstaining was with hematoxylin for
2 min. The slides were scanned at 203 on a Leica AT2 and subsequently
analyzed in a blinded manner using the Cytonuclear v1.4 algorithm on the
HALO platform.
Flow Cytometry
C26 tumors were mechanically and enzymatically homogenized using buffer
containing RPMI with 1 mg/mL collagenase (Sigma C0130) and 0.1 mg/mL
DNase (Sigma D4527). Cells were stained for flow cytometry according
to
reagent
manufacturers’
protocols.
Viability
was
determined
using
eBioscience e780 fixable viability dye at a 1/1,000 dilution. All antibodies
are listed in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. CD49b positivity
was determined using a fluorescence-minus-one control. Anti-CD16/32 (un-
conjugated; 2.4G2; 5 mg/mL; BD) was used for Fc blocking prior to antibody
staining. The eBioscience Foxp3/Transcription Factor Fixation/Permeabili-
zation Concentrate and Diluent was used prior to Foxp3 staining. Sample
analysis was performed using an LSR II cytometer. At least 200,000 events
per tumor sample were collected. Data were subsequently analyzed using
FlowJo.
Human Studies
The study and the sample acquisition were performed in concordance with
local and national guidelines. Patients at least 18 years old with histologically
confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma were recruited in the outpatient
department of the Cambridge University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust as
part of the CAMPAN study. All participants provided written informed consent.
All samples were taken between 1300 and 1500 hr. Patients were designated
cachectic if they met the international consensus definition for cachexia, i.e., if
they exhibited weight loss of >5% over past 6 months (in the absence of simple
starvation) or BMI < 20 and ongoing weight loss of more than 2% (Fearon et al.,
2011). Serum cortisol levels were assessed using the Cortisol Parameter
Assay kit from R&D Systems. Serum IL-6 levels were assessed using ELISA.
Ketone levels from plasma were assessed using Freestyle Optium Neo ketom-
eters (Abbott Laboratories).
Statistical Analysis
Statisticalanalyses,unlessotherwiseindicated,wereperformedusingGraphPad
Prism 6.
