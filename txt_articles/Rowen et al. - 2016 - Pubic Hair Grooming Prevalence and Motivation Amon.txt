IMPORTANCE Pubic hair grooming is an increasingly prevalent trend. Several studies have
sought to characterize its prevalence, associated demographics, and motivations.
OBJECTIVE To characterize current pubic hair grooming practices in the United States.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this cross-sectional study, a nationally representative
survey was conducted in January 2013 of noninstitutionalized adults aged 18 to 65 years
residing in the United States via the GfK Group (formerly Knowledge Networks) panel
members. Data analysis was performed from November to December 2015.
INTERVENTIONS A questionnaire examining pubic hair grooming habits.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Demographic characteristics and motivations associated
with pubic hair grooming.
RESULTS A total of 3372 women were surveyed. Fifty-six women did not answer the
grooming question; consequently, 3316 women were included in the analysis. Of these
women, 2778 (83.8%) reported pubic hair grooming and 538 (16.2%) reported never
grooming. On multivariate regression, several factors associated with grooming were found.
When compared with younger women (aged 18-24 years), women aged 45 through 55 years
(odds ratio [OR], 0.05; 95% CI, 0.01-0.49; P = .01) and those older than 55 years (OR, 0.04;
95% CI, 0.00-0.34; P = .003) were significantly less likely to groom. Women with some
college (OR, 3.36; 95% CI, 1.65-6.84; P = .001) or a bachelor’
s degree (OR, 2.39; 95% CI,
1.17-4.88; P = .02) were more likely to have groomed. Race was also significantly associated
with grooming, with all groups reporting less grooming when compared with white women.
No association was found between grooming and income, relationship status, or geographic
location.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study provides a nationally representative assessment of
contemporary female pubic hair grooming habits. Demographic differences in grooming were
found, which may reflect cultural variations in preference related to pubic hair. Health care
professionals and those who provide grooming services can use this information to better
counsel patients and understand grooming practices.

P
ubic hair grooming is an increasingly prevalent trend
in the 21st century.1 Several studies2-5 during the past
5 years have found that most women report engaging
in pubic grooming and hair removal, including total removal
of all pubic hair. This practice is most common in younger
women.Otherfactorsthathavebeenassociatedwithpubichair
grooming include race, being in an unmarried relationship,
sexual activity, and higher scores on sexual function scales,1,4
which implies better sex life satisfaction for women who
groom.2
Pubic hair grooming practices pose some potential risks
of injury to women, most often related to shaving.6,7 Obese
women are particularly prone to injury during pubic hair
grooming, which is important to any practitioners who ad-
dressgynecologichealth.6Therearealsoknownbenefitstopu-
bic hair grooming, such as decreased rates of pubic hair lice.8
Knowledge of grooming behaviors is important for health
care professionals because these behaviors reflect cultural
norms and a source of patient morbidity. Much of what is be-
lieved to be the driving factor for grooming is a cultural trend,
epitomized by representation of genitalia in popular media.1
The mainstream media’s portrayal of women discussing and
engaging in pubic hair removal is also a major factor for groom-
ing-related influences.9 Furthermore, there is an increasing
trend of genital cosmetic surgery, and a previous study10 high-
lights that the motivating factor is aesthetics rather than func-
tionality. Some surgeons believe that the current grooming
trendsareresponsibleforthisincreasebecausewomenareable
to visualize their labia more easily now than in the past and
are thus more motivated to change their appearance.11
A major limitation of the existing literature on pubic hair
grooming in women is generalizability.2-5 Most studies2-4 to
date have used convenience samples that are racially and de-
mographically homogenous. Some studies4,5,12 have en-
rolled more diverse populations but have been limited to spe-
cific geographic regions and often limited age ranges. To date,
there are no nationally representative samples of US women
and their current pubic hair grooming practices. Such a sample
is relevant for health care professionals because women of-
ten seek advice related to grooming and counseling on risks
for injury; hence, it is important for health care professionals
to be familiar with the common grooming practices among
women. The objective of this study is to report on pubic hair
grooming practices and characteristics associated with groom-
ing in a nationally representative sample.
Methods
Study Population
Weconductedanationallyrepresentativesurveyofnoninstitu-
tionalizedadultsaged18to65yearsresidingintheUnitedStates.
A questionnaire examining the demographic characteristics of
peoplewhoreportedalifetimehistoryofanypubichairgroom-
ing vs never having groomed was developed. For the purposes
ofthisstudy,wefocusedexclusivelyonthewomenresponders.
The survey was conducted with the GfK Group (formerly
Knowledge Networks). Details regarding GfK study methods
have been reported previously.13 Panel members for surveys
are recruited using random probability-based sampling to en-
sure that a representative sample is obtained. Panel members
are randomly recruited using address-based sampling meth-
ods. GfK samples addresses from the US Postal Service's De-
livery Sequence File. Address-based sampling estimates that
97% of households can be reached and contacted through
household mail.13 Once the panel members are recruited, they
receive notification via email to participate in a study sample.
Panel members may also check their personal online member
page to participate in survey taking. The topic of the survey is
given to participants. Participants do not see any questions
from a particular survey until they accept the survey. GfK pro-
vides a laptop or netbook computer and free internet service
to all panel members without access to the internet. For the
current study, panel members received 1000 points for com-
pleting the survey, which is the cash equivalent of $1.
In addition to standard measures taken by GfK to en-
hance survey cooperation, email reminders were sent to non-
responders on day 3 of the field period. A pretest survey was
conducted in December 2012 to ensure responders under-
stood the questions. The final survey was conducted in Janu-
ary 2013. All participants provided written informed consent
before the beginning of the survey. Data analysis was per-
formed from November to December 2015.
GfK uses statistical weighting adjustments to correct for
known deviations. Additional survey errors, such as noncov-
erage and nonresponse, are also corrected for using panel
demographicpoststratificationweights.TheCommitteeonHu-
man Research at the University of California, San Francisco,
approved the study.
Predictor Variables
The following demographic data were collected: age, race, re-
lationship status, educational level, and geographic region. We
also asked about personal and ideal hairiness (using dia-
grams),theroleofapartner’spreferenceforgrooming,andspe-
cifics about sexual activity.
Outcome Variables
For the current study, we explored differences in characteris-
tics of groomers, defined as women who reported any groom-
ing, vs nongroomers.
Key Points
Question What is the rate of female pubic hair grooming in the
United States?
Findings In a nationally representative sample, US women are
more likely to groom their pubic hair if they are younger, white,
and more educated. They also groom if their partner prefers them
to do so without being based on actual sexual practices.
Meaning Women in the United States increasingly are grooming
their pubic hair for cosmetic purposes, but this trend appears to
occur within specific demographic groups of women.

Statistical Analysis
Data analysis was conducted using the survey function within
STATA statistical software, version 12.0 (StataCorp), to ac-
countforcomplexsamplingdesign.P<.05wasconsideredsta-
tistically significant, and all statistical tests were 2 sided. All
missing or incomplete data were excluded from the analyses.
Demographic characteristics and sexual characteristics were
compared between groomers and nongroomers using 2-sided
t tests. All variables with P < .20 in univariate models and vari-
ables thought to be suggestive of grooming were added to the
multivariatelogisticmodel.Multivariatelogisticregressionwas
used to see which factors have the greatest odds of the
outcome of grooming. Of women who reported pubic hair

often groomed were obtained via summary statistics.
Results
A total of 3372 women were surveyed. Fifty-six women did not
answer the grooming question; consequently, 3316 women
wereincludedintheanalysis.Demographicinformationispre-
sentedinTable1.Overall,therewasbroadrepresentationacross
the United States in terms of age and racial diversity. A total
of2778women(83.8%)reportedalifetimehistoryofpubichair
grooming, and 538 (16.2%) reported no grooming history
(Table 2). There was a bimodal distribution to the frequency
of grooming, with the mean frequency being monthly groom-
ing. A total of 133 women (4.8%) reported performing daily
grooming. When asked where they groom, most women re-
ported grooming the hair above and around the vagina (2054
[73.9%] and 2087 [75.1%], respectively), and relatively few re-
ported grooming the buttocks and around the anus (196 [7.1%]
and 621 [22.4%], respectively). A total of 1710 women (62.1%)
reported removing all their pubic hair at some point. A total
of2577women(92.8%)reportedthattheyperformedtheirown
grooming.
The most common motivations for grooming were for hy-
gienic purposes (1640 [59.0%]) and/or as part of their routine
(1292 [45.5%]) (Table 2). A total of 875 (31.5%) reported groom-
ing because they believe it makes their genitals more attrac-
tive, and 586 (21.1%) reported grooming because of partner
preference.Whenaskedaboutsituationsforwhichtheygroom,
women reported sex as the most common reason (1544
[55.6%]) but also vacation (1270 [45.7%]) and health care pro-
fessional visit (1111 [40.0%]).
In bivariate χ2 analysis (Table 3), grooming was signifi-
cantly associated with age; younger women were more likely
to report grooming than older groups. Women who groomed
were more likely to have higher educational levels and in-
comes.Whitewomenweremorelikelytoreportgroomingthan
women of other self-identified racial/ethnic groups. Women
who were widowed, separated, or single were less likely to
groom, but there was no difference in the percentage of mar-
ried women who reported grooming. There was also no dif-
ference in grooming habits by geographic region or number of
recent sexual partners. The Figure presents the distribution of
groomingfrequencyduringthepastyearinrelationtoage,edu-
cational level, and race.
Women who reported grooming had twice the mean num-
ber of lifetime partners as those who did not groom (9.0 vs 4.4,
P = .005) and were significantly more likely to have more regu-
lar sexual activity (P = .001) and engage in active and recep-
tive oral sex (P < .001).
On multivariate regression, we found several factors as-
sociated with grooming (Table 4). When compared with

those older than 55 years (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.00-0.34;

CI, 0.24-0.75; P > .003). Women were also less likely to
groom if their partner did not prefer it (OR, 0.04; 95% CI,
0.02-0.10; P < .001). Number of lifetime sexual partners was
associated with grooming (OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.02-1.09;
P = .003). Of note, frequency of sex, types of sexual activity,
and sex of sexual partner were not associated with grooming
after multivariable adjustment.

Pubic hair grooming has been the subject of a number of
recent research efforts. Herbenick et al2 published the initial
large study on grooming. Although the study population was
large, most participants were white (86%) and young (mean
age, 32 years). Their group also reported that younger age was

a significant predictor of grooming, as was relationship sta-
tus and sexual activity; namely, unmarried women and those
who engage in oral sex were more likely to groom. A fol-
low-up study5 comparing men and women’s grooming prac-
tices was again a convenience sample recruited from college
campuses who were mainly white and younger. Additional
studies6,12havesoughttobroadentherespondentbase,mainly
through convenience samples in Texas, where there was a
largerrepresentationofLatinawomen.DeMariaandBerenson12
also found that white women were significantly more likely
toengageingroomingthanblackandLatinawomen.Aftermul-
tivariate regression, these authors also reported a positive as-
sociation of grooming with income and a negative associa-
tion with age. Within this study, the authors also found that
there were increased rates of grooming-related injuries among
obese women.
Ourfindingscorroboratepreviousstudies2,5intermsofthe
inverse association between age and grooming habits. Much
has been written about the new trends in popular culture re-
lated to hairlessness and genitals. Ramsey et al1 published a
review that addresses the sociocultural, anthropologic, psy-
chological, and sexual aspects of pubic hair removal. These au-
thorssuggestthatthemoderntrendofpubichairremovallikely
originated in South America (hence the term Brazilian as slang
for complete pubic hair removal) but that the increased preva-
lenceofpornographythatdepictsbaregenitalia,popularmaga-
zines, and television are primary drivers of the trend in the
United States.

when visiting a health care professional. This finding suggests
that women are self-conscious about their appearance even in
nonsocial settings. Thus, any exposure to her genital area may
driveawomantogroom,evenwhenthehealthcareprofessional
is an unbiased professional providing medical care.
Unlike prior studies,2,5 we did not find an association be-
tween income and grooming; however, we found a positive as-
sociation between grooming and educational level. The multi-
variableanalysisandcontrolformanyconfoundingfactorslikely

plained by the same cultural norms that contribute to younger
women engaging in pubic hair grooming. Given the wide avail-

en,itseemslesslikelythateducationisrelatedtomoreexposure
to popular culture ideals. Similar to other studies,4,12 we found

en being far more likely to groom than any other racial/ethnic
group.Thisfindinghasbeendocumentedinapriorstudy12 and
seen as most likely to be related to cultural norms and ideals of
beauty among different racial groups.
Our study is unique in assessing the role of the partner in
grooming. Indeed, we found that women were far more likely
to groom if their partner also groomed and if their partner pre-
ferred that they groom. This finding is important because it
highlights the role of sexual relationships as being a strong pre-
dictor of grooming. In contrast to the study by Herbenick et
al,2 which looked at similar outcomes and measures, we did
not detect an association between types of relationship and
typesofsexualactivityandgroomingaftermultivariableanaly-
sis. A clear example of this behavior is demonstrated by 22.4%
of women who groomed around the anus while only 10.0% en-
gaged in any anal-related sexual activity in the prior year. This
difference between our study and prior studies is the role of
multivariate regression to control for confounders and the rep-
resentative nature of our sample. Thus, although the prevail-
ing wisdom has been that grooming is related to specific types
of sexual activities or relationships in women, our analysis dis-
putes these conclusions.
To our knowledge, our study is the first representative
sample of women from across the United States. Its strengths
include a large, nationally representative sample from a well-
validated source. Participants completed our survey via the in-
ternet, which facilitates privacy and ease of access. Internet
access was provided to all those without access. However, our
studyisnotwithoutlimitations.Allindividualscontactedmust
have had a home address in the United States and be nonin-
stitutionalized. Thus, these results may be difficult to gener-
alize to the entire US population. Given the sensitive nature
of our survey, some participants may not have felt comfort-
able answering questions about sexual behavior and pubic hair
grooming.
Conclusions
Female pubic hair grooming is a common practice seen by all
health care professionals and providers of aesthetic treat-
ments for women. Familiarity with the motivations and char-
acteristics of women who groom can help inform health care
professionals in terms of identifying women for counseling
regarding grooming risks. Furthermore, our study demon-
strates that, contrary to prior studies,2,3,5 grooming is less as-
sociated with specific sexual activity and relationship type and
more associated with age, race, and educational level. We also
found that women were more likely to groom based on their
partner’s preference and some groom before visiting a health
care professional. Thus, our study demonstrates a role for cul-
tural sensitivity as it relates to pubic hair grooming because
