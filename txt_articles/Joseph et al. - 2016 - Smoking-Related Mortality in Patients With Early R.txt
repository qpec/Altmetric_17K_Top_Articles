Objective. To investigate the association between smoking status and smoking cessation with mortality in patients with
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods. An incident cohort of patients with RA was identified using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink, a database of
UK primary care electronic medical records. Time-varying smoking status, years of cessation, and amount smoked were
determined from patients’ medical records. The date and underlying cause of death were identified by linkage with Office for
National Statistics records. The associations between smoking status and smoking cessation with all-cause and cause-
specific mortality (circulatory disease, all cancers, lung cancer, respiratory disease, and respiratory infection) were investi-
gated using adjusted Cox (all-cause mortality) and Fine-Gray (cause-specific mortality) regression.
Results. The cohort comprised 5,677 patients (median age 61.4 years, 68% women), with 40% as never smokers, 34% former
smokers, and 26% current smokers at baseline. Compared to never smoking, current smoking was associated with an increased
risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 1.98 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.56, 2.53]), and mortality due to circulatory dis-
ease (subdistribution hazard ratio [SHR] 1.96 [95% CI 1.33, 2.90]) and lung cancer (SHR 23.2 [95% CI 5.15, 105]). Each year of
smoking cessation was associated with a decreased risk of all-cause mortality (former heavy smokers SHR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77,
0.94], former light smokers SHR 0.90 [95% CI 0.84, 0.97]).
Conclusion. Current smoking is associated with an increased risk of all-cause, cardiovascular, and lung cancer mortality in
patients with RA. Each year of cessation is associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality. This information may prove
helpful in smoking cessation programs for patients with RA.
INTRODUCTION
Smoking is a known risk factor for the development of rheu-
matoid arthritis (RA) (1). The prevalence of smoking is, there-
fore, higher in patients with RA than in the general population
(2). Tobacco smoking is associated with an increased risk of
death in the general population, with an estimated 17% of
adult deaths in England attributable to smoking in 2013 (3).
Participants in the Million Women Study who smoked at base-
line had approximately 2.7 times increased mortality com-
pared to never smokers (4). Smoking is associated with
increased risk of death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD),
respiratory infection, and certain forms of cancer, including

 lung cancer (3,4). There is also evidence that smoking cessation
is associated with a gradual normalization of death rates (4).
Patients with RA experience an approximately 1.5-fold
increased mortality compared to the general population
(5,6). The most frequent causes of premature mortality in
patients with RA are CVD, malignancy, including lung can-
cer, severe infection, and respiratory diseases (7–9). Some of
the excess mortality in RA is probably attributable to the
higher prevalence of smoking. Existing studies have reported
an increased risk of mortality associated with smoking (47%
per additional pack of cigarettes per day [10] or 83% for ever
smoking compared to never smoking [7]).
There is some evidence that smoking is associated with an
increased risk of death due to cardiopulmonary causes in
patients with RA (10). Other studies found that smoking
does not predict death from lower respiratory tract infection
(11) or cancer (12) in patients with inflammatory arthritis.
The question as to whether smoking cessation is beneficial
with respect to mortality in patients with RA has not previ-
ously been addressed. The aims of this study were to investi-
gate, in patients with RA drawn from a primary care setting,
the association between tobacco smoking and all-cause mor-
tality and mortality due to CVD, all cancers, lung cancer,
respiratory infection, and other respiratory disease, and the
association between smoking cessation and all-cause and
cause-specific mortality.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Setting. The study was set within the Clinical Practice
Research Datalink (CPRD), a UK database of anonymized pri-
mary care electronic medical records (13). The CPRD has been
collecting data since 1987 and currently holds the records of
almost 13 million patients, with active patients representing
approximately 7% of the UK population. Data held include
patient demographics, prescriptions issued, and information
about medical conditions, referrals, and clinical tests coded
using Read codes (14).
CPRD data can be linked with the Office for National Sta-
tistics (ONS) mortality data and the Hospital Episode Statis-
tics (HES) database. To be eligible for linkage, patients are
required to have a valid NHS number and be registered with
an English general practice participating in the linkage
scheme (56% of all CPRD practices). In England, all deaths
must be reported to the ONS, and the mortality data avail-
able through linkage include the date and underlying cause
of death as reported on death certificates (coded using the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
[ICD-9] and Tenth Revision [ICD-10] codes). The HES data
contain information on hospital inpatient admissions in
England and include the reason for admission, coded using
ICD-10 codes, and any procedures carried out, coded using
Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification of
Interventions and Procedures version 4 (OPCS-4) codes.
Population. An incident cohort of adults (ages $16) with
RA was defined within the CPRD data set. All patients with
a Read code for RA in their CPRD records were identified
(see Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis Care
& Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/
10.1002/acr.22882/abstract). A validated algorithm shown
to have 84% sensitivity and 86% specificity in identifying
RA patients (based on fulfilling the 1987 American College
of Rheumatology criteria for RA [15] or expert opinion [16])
was then applied to identify the probable true RA patients
(see Supplementary Figure 1, available on the Arthritis Care &
Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.
1002/acr.22882/abstract). Linkage with HES and the ONS was
requested for the patients identified. Only those patients who
were eligible for linkage were included in the final cohort.
To increase the likelihood that only incident RA cases were
included, patients were further required to have at least 3 years
of up-to-standard followup within the CPRD prior to their RA
diagnosis. Patients prescribed a disease-modifying antirheu-
matic drug (DMARD) more than 3 months before their first
recorded RA Read code were also excluded. The date of the
first RA Read code or first DMARD prescription (whichever
was earliest) was taken to be the date of RA diagnosis.
Study window. Data linkage with ONS and HES was
available from January 1, 1998 to January 10, 2012, and these
dates formed the study window. Patients diagnosed on or
after the start of the study window entered the cohort on
their RA diagnosis date. Patients were followed until death,
leaving their general practice, or the last data collection date
for their practice, whichever came first. For those remaining
in the cohort, followup was censored on January 10, 2012.
Exposure. Smoking status was defined using the CPRD
data sets and could vary through time. Followup was divided
into periods of never smoking, current smoking, or former
smoking. A description of how smoking status was defined is
available in Supplementary Figure 2 (available on the Arthri-
tis Care & Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.
com/doi/10.1002/acr.22882/abstract).
For former smokers, the duration of smoking cessation (in
years) was calculated. The maximum possible duration of
known smoking cessation at baseline was 3 years. Any ces-
sation time recorded prior to this limit was not used, as
Significance & Innovations
� In this large population-based study, smoking status
was allowed to vary throughout followup, reflecting
patients’ smoking behavior after a diagnosis of rheu-
matoid arthritis and allowing duration of smoking
cessation to be modelled.
� The risks of all-cause mortality and death due to
lung cancer and circulatory disease were increased
in current smokers compared to both never smokers
and those who stopped smoking.
� In former smokers the risk of all-cause mortality
decreased for each additional year of smoking ces-
sation, with a greater decrease for patients who had
been heavy smokers.
� This information on the risks of continuing to smoke
after receiving a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis
could be useful in smoking cessation programs.
Early RA and Smoking-Related Mortality
1599
 patients had variable amounts of CPRD followup prior to RA
diagnosis. The start of cessation was set as the midpoint
between the most recent record of an alternative category
and the first record of each period of former smoking. To
account for a possible interaction with amount smoked, we
calculated the amount smoked (heavy versus light) at base-
line, using information recorded #3 years after baseline.
Heavy smoking was defined as smoking more than 20 ciga-
rettes or 10 cigars a day.
Outcome. The date and underlying cause of death were
identified from the linked ONS data. The following underly-
ing causes of death were studied: cancer (ICD-9 140-239,
ICD-10 chapter C), lung cancer (ICD-9 162, ICD-10 C34), circu-
latory disease (ICD-9 390-459, ICD-10 chapter I), lower respi-
ratory tract infection (code list available on ClinicalCodes.org
[17]), and other respiratory causes (ICD-9 460-519, ICD-10
chapter J, both minus the infection codes).
Covariates. Age, sex, socioeconomic status (SES), year of
RA diagnosis, and baseline body mass index (BMI) were iden-
tified. SES was defined using the quintile of Townsend score
(18), at the ONS small-area level, based on the patient’s postal
code. The year of diagnosis, used as a marker for calendar-year
effects, was categorized as before or after January 1, 2000, to
coincide with the introduction of biologic therapies for RA in
the UK. The data cleaning steps and definition of BMI are
described in Supplementary Figure 3 (available on the Arthritis
Care & Research web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/
doi/10.1002/acr.22882/abstract).
Type 2 diabetes mellitus was identified within the CPRD
data sets using a predefined list of Read codes. CVD was
identified within the CPRD and HES data sets using Read
codes and ICD-10 codes for myocardial infarction or stroke,

 and OPCS-4 codes for CVD-related procedures such as
revascularization. Code lists for diabetes mellitus and CVD
are available on ClinicalCodes.org (17). Diabetes mellitus
and CVD were included as time-varying covariates, defined
as present from the date of the first ever record onwards, or
not present otherwise.
Lists of product codes for DMARDs, oral glucocorticoids, car-
diovascular medication (e.g., diuretics, beta-blockers), aspirin
and antiplatelet agents, lipid regulators, and nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs were generated based on British National
Formulary chapters (19) and clinical knowledge. Use of im-
munosuppressant DMARDs (methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclo-
sporin, cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, and mycophenolate)
was included as a marker of disease severity and thus was
defined as present from the date of the first prescription
onwards. For oral glucocorticoids, the stop date was calculated
using any quantity, daily dose, and duration information pro-
vided. For all other included medications, patients were con-
sidered as taking the medication for 1 month from the date that
each prescription was issued (the standard length for a UK pre-
scription), unless a further prescription had been issued.
Statistical analysis. Baseline characteristics were described
using the median and interquartile range (IQR) or proportions.
Baseline differences between smoking categories were tested
using the chi-square test for categorical variables or the Kruskal-
Wallis test for continuous variables. A significance level of 0.05
was used throughout.
Crude mortality rates were calculated and then adjusted for
age and sex by direct standardization of the smoking subgroups
to the whole incident cohort. Survival analysis was performed
to investigate the association between smoking status and mor-
tality. All-cause and cause-specific mortality were examined.
Analyses were adjusted first for age and sex, then for all
covariates. The association between smoking cessation and
mortality was examined in former smokers, including the years
of cessation, amount smoked, and their interaction in the mod-
els. Years of cessation was entered into the models as a continu-
ous variable, estimating the linear change in risk for each
additional year of cessation. The Cox regression model was
used to investigate all-cause mortality. For cause-specific mor-
tality, where death due to other causes is a competing risk, the
Fine-Gray model was applied (20). The parameters estimated
by the Fine-Gray model (subdistribution hazard ratios [SHR])
reflect the association between a variable and the probability
of an outcome but are also influenced by the variable’s associ-
ation with the competing outcomes (21). The proportional
hazards assumption was tested for each model by inspecting
the Schoenfeld residuals, plotting log (2log[survival]) versus
log of survival time plots and looking for interactions between
covariates and study time.
For some patients, data were missing for BMI, SES, and
amount smoked. Multiple imputation by chained equations
(22) was performed using the MI suite in Stata to deal with
missing values for BMI and amount smoked. Linear regres-
sion was used to impute BMI and logistic regression to
impute amount smoked. All predictors included in the final
models, including interaction terms, were entered in the
imputation model. Twenty data sets were imputed. For the
analyses, the results were combined using Rubin’s rules
(23). All data handling and analysis was performed using
Stata/MP software, version 12.1. The protocol for this study
was reviewed and approved by the Independent Scientific
Advisory Committee (protocol reference 13_159).

There were 5,904 patients with validated incident RA eli-
gible for inclusion in the cohort (Figure 1). After excluding

 227 patients (4%) with missing baseline smoking status, 5,677
patients remained in the cohort, with 3,850 (67.8%) women.
The median age at RA diagnosis was 61.4 years (IQR 51.2–71.3)
(Table 1). At baseline, 2,288 (40.3%) were never smokers, 1,935
(34.1%) were former smokers, and 1,454 (25.6%) were current
smokers. During followup, 917 patients (16%) changed smok-
ing status, including 348 current smokers recorded as stopping
smoking after a single attempt. The amount smoked was miss-
ing for 27% of former smokers. Of those with this information,
32% ever smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day.

 All-cause mortality. During 26,679 person-years of fol-
lowup, 574 patients died, giving a crude mortality rate of
21.5 per 1,000 person-years (95% confidence interval [95%
CI] 19.8, 23.3) (Table 2). After age-sex standardization, the
mortality rates for never, former, and current smokers were
16.2 (95% CI 13.7, 18.6), 22.4 (95% CI 19.7, 25.2), and 31.6
(95% CI 25.3, 37.9) per 1,000 person-years, respectively,
equating to approximately 6 deaths per 1,000 person-years
attributable to former smoking and 15 deaths per 1,000
person-years attributable to current smoking.
After adjustment for age and sex, current smokers had a
significantly higher risk of death than never smokers (haz-
ard ratio [HR] 2.18 [95% CI 1.73, 2.76]) or former smokers
(HR 1.77 [95% CI 1.43, 2.20]) (Table 3). This risk persisted
after full adjustment. Former smokers had a higher mortal-
ity risk than never smokers (HR[age.sex adjusted] 1.23
[95% CI 1.01, 1.49]) but this risk became nonsignificant
after full adjustment (HR 1.18 [95% CI 0.97, 1.44]).
In former smokers, the risk of mortality fell significantly
with each year since stopping (former heavy smokers HR[full
adjusted] 0.85 [95% CI 0.77, 0.94], former light smokers
HR[full adjusted] 0.90 [95% CI 0.84, 0.97]). The interaction
between cessation years and amount smoked was not signifi-
cant (HR[full adjusted] 0.95 [95% CI 0.84, 1.06]).
Cause-specific mortality. The major cause of death for
the cohort was circulatory disease, with a crude mortality
rate of 8.3 per 1,000 person-years (95% CI 7.3, 9.4) (Table 4).
In most cases the age-sex standardized mortality rates were
lowest in never smokers and highest in current smokers.
This finding was not true for deaths due to respiratory dis-
ease, however, for which former smokers had the highest
mortality rate.
This pattern was reflected in the results of the Fine-Gray
regression models (Table 5), where the risks of mortality due
to circulatory disease and lung cancer were increased in cur-
rent compared to both never and former smokers. The
results were not significant for all-site cancer or respiratory
infection. The risk of mortality due to lung cancer was
increased in former compared to never smokers (SHR[full
adjusted] 7.78 [95% CI 1.73, 35.0]); this finding was also the
case for mortality due to respiratory disease, although the
result was not statistically significant.
In former heavy smokers, each year of smoking cessa-
tion was associated with a decrease in the risk of mortality
due to cancer, circulatory disease, and respiratory disease,
although this finding was significant only for deaths due
to circulatory disease (Table 5). Each year of smoking ces-
sation was associated with a decrease in the risk of death
due to respiratory infection for former light smokers.
DISCUSSION
In this incident cohort of 5,677 patients with RA, tobacco
smoking was associated with an increased risk of mortality.
Current smokers had more than double the risk of dying from
any cause during followup compared to those who had never
smoked. Current smokers also had significantly increased
risk of dying due to circulatory disease or lung cancer.
Strengths of the study include that it is a large population-
based inception cohort of patients with RA, with sufficient
power to examine both all-cause and cause-specific mortality
and that, via record linkage, mortality data for the cohort
are complete. The CPRD patient population is broadly repre-
sentative of the UK population (14,24). While our cohort was
limited to practices with linkage to the English HES and ONS
databases, leading to 43% of patients being excluded, the
cohort should be representative of all English patients with
RA. A further strength is that smoking status is treated in a
time-varying fashion, as smoking status changed for 16% of
patients during followup. Previous studies of smoking and
mortality in RA have only used smoking status at baseline. By
allowing smoking status to vary throughout followup, our
study reflects more accurately the patients’ exposure. This is
also the first study to use a competing risks model to examine
the relationship between smoking and cause-specific mortal-
ity in RA.
An increased risk of all-cause mortality associated with
smoking in patients with RA has been demonstrated in
some (7,10), but not all (8,25), previous studies. One of the
2 studies which reported no association, the Early Rheu-
matoid Arthritis Study (25), collected smoking data retro-
spectively, and data were missing for 37% of patients. The
proportion with missing smoking was probably higher in
those who had died and so those who were analyzed may
have been healthier or at reduced risk of smoking-related
mortality. Patients in the second study, the Norfolk Arthritis
Register cohort (8), were younger at diagnosis than our
CPRD cohort (median age at onset 53 versus 61 years) and
included all patients with early inflammatory arthritis; the
proportion of smoking-related deaths may have been lower
in such a cohort.
Both previous studies that examined the association
between smoking and CVD mortality failed to find a signifi-
cant association (25,26). In the study from the Mayo clinic
(26), current smokers had double the risk of cardiovascular
death compared to never smokers, although this finding did
not reach statistical significance (HR 1.98 [95% CI 0.93,
4.24]), perhaps because the study was underpowered (603
patients). We did not find a significant association between
current smoking and deaths due to all-site cancer but found
a strong association between current smoking and deaths
due to lung cancer. Mattey et al (27), also found no associa-
tion between smoking and mortality due to all cancers but
reported a strong association between smoking and deaths
due to lung cancer in patients with RA (HR 8.97 [95% CI
1.71, 37.0]).
We found an increased risk of death from respiratory infec-
tion among current smokers, although this did not reach sta-
tistical significance as the number of deaths (n 5 41) was low.
For other respiratory mortality, former smokers had a nonsig-
nificant increased risk of death compared to both current and
never smokers. This risk could be because patients with pre-
existing respiratory disorders are more likely to stop smoking.
Former smokers were also more likely to have had a CVD
event or to be treated with cardiovascular medications at
baseline, which suggests that the risk or presence of smoking-
related outcomes could be motivating patients to stop smok-
ing. Therefore, those who continue to smoke may be compar-
atively healthy.
Early RA and Smoking-Related Mortality
1603
 A decrease in risk of all-cause mortality and death
due to circulatory disease was seen for each year of smok-
ing cessation, particularly for those who had been heavy
smokers. These results are in agreement with most of the
literature from the general population (4,28). The SHRs for
all-cancer and respiratory deaths were similar to those for cir-
culatory disease but failed to reach statistical significance,
while the risk of death due to respiratory infection was found

 to decrease for each year of cessation in former light smokers
only. There is some evidence for a benefit of smoking cessa-
tion for specific causes of death in other populations. In the
Lung Health study, which comprised individuals who were,
on average, heavy smokers with evidence of airway obstruc-
tion, mortality rates fell progressively from those who contin-
ued to smoke, to intermittent quitters and to those who
successfully stopped smoking (29). This pattern was seen for
deaths due to coronary heart disease, CVD, and lung cancer
(but not other forms of cancer).
Limitations of our study include the limited followup
time, in addition to which, reducing the sample size and
linkage with HES and the ONS reduced the length of the
study window. Mean followup was 4.7 years, with a range
of 0–14 years. The association between smoking and mor-
tality may alter as the disease progresses. Another limita-
tion is reliance on an algorithm to identify cases of RA
(16) rather than being able to apply classification criteria
on an individual basis. This is a general limitation for
research set within routinely collected health data, in
which it is usually not feasible or possible to verify indi-
vidual diagnoses. The algorithm used has a sensitivity
and specificity of over 80%, and we consider the patients
included in the cohort to be highly probable cases, while
acknowledging that some patients will have been wrongly
excluded or included. In addition, this inception cohort is
possibly contaminated by prevalent cases. Patients with
prevalent RA may have been included as incident cases if
they had no significant medical events or changes in med-
ication in the 3 years prior to inclusion. Our definition of
RA diagnosis date introduces some immortal time, up to a
maximum of 3 months per patient. Those who enter upon
DMARD prescription survive at least until receiving an
RA Read code. As this result is unlikely to be associated
with smoking behavior, we believe it is unlikely to be a
source of bias.
Furthermore, misclassification in smoking exposure could
result from using general practitioner (GP) records. Smoking
information in the CPRD will be affected by how frequently
patients visit their GP, how often smoking information was
recorded at consultations, how accurately patients report
their smoking behavior, and how accurately practice staff
record the information. There is some evidence that current
smoking is more completely and accurately captured by UK
GPs than never and former smoking (30,31). Former smoking
in particular was poorly captured in the 1990s, but there is
evidence of an improvement over time (31,32). Patients may
underreport their smoking habits to their health care prov-
iders, and some cessation attempts could be missed. Overall,
the effect of misclassification is likely to make the exposure
groups more similar to each other, which would lead to
underestimation of any associations.
In conclusion, patients with RA who smoked tobacco
were at significantly increased risk of death from all-causes
and death due to circulatory disease or lung cancer com-
pared to RA patients who never smoked and those who
stopped smoking. The risk of all-cause mortality fell signifi-
cantly for each year of smoking cessation. This information
may be of value to those developing smoking cessation pro-
grams for patients with RA (33).
