ABSTRACT
Aim: Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in
premature infants. By the time symptoms appear, it may already be too late to prevent a
severe course, with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality. We aimed to develop a rapid
test of lung maturity for targeting surfactant supplementation.
Methods: Concentrations of the most surface-active lung phospholipid
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin in gastric aspirates from premature
infants were measured by mass spectrometry and expressed as the lecithin/sphingomyelin
ratio (L/S). The same aspirates were analysed with mid-infrared spectroscopy.
Subsequently, L/S was measured in gastric aspirates and oropharyngeal secretions from
another group of premature infants using spectroscopy and the results were compared
with RDS development. The 10-minute analysis required 10 lL of aspirate.
Results: An L/S algorithm was developed based on 89 aspirates. Subsequently, gastric
aspirates were sampled in 136 infants of 24–31 weeks of gestation and 61 (45%)
developed RDS. The cut-off value of L/S was 2.2, sensitivity was 92%, and specificity was
73%. In 59 cases, the oropharyngeal secretions had less valid L/S than gastric aspirate results.
Conclusion: Our rapid test for lung maturity, based on spectroscopy of gastric aspirate,
predicted RDS with high sensitivity.

 premature infants with a gestational age of less than
30 weeks have immature lungs and approximately half still
require treatment with surfactant when treated with nCPAP
or mechanical ventilation (1,2). In recent years, there have
been several improvements in treatment, which have
helped reduce the incidence and severity of RDS and
bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Minimal use of oxygen in
the delivery room (3) and in the neonatal period is an
important development in care. Very early treatment with
nCPAP, combined with minimal use of mechanical venti-
lation, especially during initial treatment, reduces ventila-
tor-induced lung damage and is now widely used (4,5).
Over the years, early rescue treatment with surfactant has
been strongly associated with a more favourable outcome
compared to late rescue treatment (6–8). Better outcomes
are also seen with a combination of nCPAP and surfactant
(7,8). Finally, less invasive administration of surfactant
via a thin catheter has emerged as an alternative method,
especially in the most preterm infants (9). However, we
need to treat selectively with surfactant, and very soon after
birth, in order to substantially improve the prognosis of
RDS and bronchopulmonary dysplasia. In many cases, this
needs to happen before symptoms are present. In order to
do so, we need a bedside test that can quickly identify which
infants have surfactant deficiency to target treatment
effectively (10). Prophylactic treatment has been widely
used, but it has been shown to increase the combined
mortality and incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia
(11).
Biomarkers expressing lung maturity have been identified
in amniotic fluid (12), gastric aspirate (13) and hypopha-
ryngeal secretions (14). These fluids are partially produced
in the foetal lungs as well as in the kidneys and the amniotic
sac and therefore contain lung surfactant (15). The classic
method to determine surfactant in amniotic fluid has been
measuring lecithin/sphingomyelin ratio (L/S) with thin-
layer chromatography (12,16). Sphingomyelin secretion
remains fairly constant during pregnancy, whereas lecithin
secretion increases in parallel with lung maturation. Con-
sequently, L/S reflects lung maturity independently of
dilution sampling effects (12). However, this well-known
diagnostic procedure to measure lung surfactant is slow and
complex (16).
Gastric aspirate and oropharyngeal secretion are easier to
obtain and measure than amniotic fluid (17,18). Previously,
we have measured the surfactant content in gastric aspirate
with microbubble stability tests (19) and with lamellar body
counts (20). We also conducted a randomised trial in very
preterm infants with early surfactant guided by lamellar
body counts in gastric aspirate versus traditional surfactant
treatment (21). Use of lamellar body counts as a guide for
early surfactant treatment led to a significant reduction in
the need of oxygen at six hours of age and by day 28.
Furthermore, the time on oxygen therapy was reduced and
there was a trend towards a lower incidence of bronchopul-
monary dysplasia. The earlier that the lamellar body counts
were measured, the better the outcome. Dilution, however,
was a problem with both the microbubble stability test and
lamellar body counts. Furthermore, both these methods,
and similar tests, are labour and laboratory intensive and
require a minimum of two to three hours for analysis. This
makes these methods less suitable for use as bedside tests.
The aim of this study was to predict the risk of RDS by
measuring lung maturity. To achieve this, we developed a
rapid test using spectroscopic analysis of L/S in small
volumes of oropharyngeal secretion and from gastric aspi-
rate obtained from gastric tubes placed as part of routine
neonatal management. Subsequently, we validated this
method in a number of premature infants by comparing
the appearance of RDS with L/S.
PATIENTS AND METHODS
Study design
The study was a multicentre nonintervention diagnostic
study with two phases.
In the method development phase, which was phase one
of the study, gastric aspirate samples from a group of
premature infants were analysed by mass spectroscopy
(MS) to obtain reference values for the concentration of
lecithin, which is also called phosphatidylcholine, and
sphingomyelin. The same gastric aspirate samples were
then measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR), and an algorithm was developed to quantify
phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin concentrations by
spectroscopy. These are detailed below and in Appendix S1.
The concentration determined by MS of the lecithin species
with the highest surface activity, dipalmitoylphosphatidyl-
choline (DPPC), was used to calculate the L/S. This
phospholipid is only present at very low concentrations in
blood or meconium.
During the clinical phase, which was phase two of the
study, another population of premature infants had gastric
aspirate and oropharyngeal samples obtained shortly after
birth. These infants were monitored for the first five days of
life and all clinically relevant data captured. L/S from this
population was then determined by spectroscopy and
analysed by the algorithm. The results were subsequently
compared with the prevalence and severity of RDS.
The trial was approved by the research ethics committees
of each centre. Informed oral and written parental consent
was obtained either before birth or immediately following
birth.
Pre-analytical handling of samples
The gastric aspirates were frozen at �20°C shortly after they
were drawn. Gastric aspirate may contain blood, cells,
meconium, particular matters and mucus. Before the anal-
yses in both phases of the study, the samples were thawed
and mixed thoroughly followed by mild centrifugation of
300 g for three minutes. Cells and particulate matter
precipitated and mucus gathered in the upper part of the
sample. Sample aliquots for the analyses were taken from
the clear midsection of the sample.
Oropharyngeal secretions were frozen at _20°C shortly
after they were drawn. Before the analysis was carried out,

 the samples were thawed and 50 lL of distilled water was
added to each oropharyngeal secretion sample due to the
low volume available for analysis. The diluted oropharyn-
geal secretion samples were processed in the same way as
the gastric aspirates.
Phase one: method development
To develop the L/S algorithm, 89 newborn infants from
Denmark, UK and Sweden had gastric aspirate sampled
from gastric tubes placed for routine clinical reasons shortly
after birth. The infants had a median gestational age of 29.5,
with a range of 24.2–33.7 weeks.
Mass spectroscopy
MS, which was the reference method, was carried out on
the 89 gastric aspirate samples. 125 lL of aspirate was
mixed with 10 lL of antioxidant (butylated hydroxytoluene,
50 g/L). Internal standards in chloroform to a final con-
centration of 1.0 nmol dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine per
sample were then added. Once this was complete, samples
were lipid-extracted using dichloromethane and methanol
(22) and the lipid-containing lower organic phase removed
and dried under warmed nitrogen gas. Once they were
dried, the samples were capped with an airtight seal and
stored at _20°C until analysis. Immediately prior to MS, the
samples were reconstituted in 300 lL solvent comprising
methanol,
dichloromethane,
water
and
concentrated
ammonia (66:30:3:1, v:v).
MS analysis of the individual molecular species of
lecithin, including DPPC and sphingomyelin, was per-
formed by direct infusion on a Xevo TQ MS (Waters,
Manchester, UK) fitted with an electrospray ionisation

FTIR spectroscopy
Spectra were recorded in the mid-infrared region (3200–
900 cm�1) by a Tensor 27 FTIR spectrometer (Bruker,
Massachusetts, USA). A nitrogen-cooled mercury cadmium
telluride detector and an attenuated total reflection cell,
Harric BioATRcellII, with a silicon crystal were used. The
temperature of the attenuated total reflection cell was 30°C.
Spectra were recorded using OPUS software version 7.2
(Bruker, Massachusetts, USA). Gastric aspirate (20 lL) was
transferred to a fresh vial containing 20 lL of internal
standard (potassium thiocyanate 1 g/L). Then, 6 lL of this
mixture was applied to the attenuated total reflection
crystal. The sample was dried for two minutes under a
gentle stream of air (40–45°C). Each sample was applied
twice, and for each application, two spectra were recorded.
The mean value of the four spectra was calculated, and
the baseline was corrected and normalised with respect to
the potassium thiocyanate peak at 2.000–2.110 cm�1. The
spectroscopy after pre-analytic handling of each sample was
completed in less than 10 minutes.
Calibration of the FTIR methods
Calibration of the FTIR methods was carried out with the
89 gastric aspirate samples with reference concentrations of
DPPC and total sphingomyelin measured by MS.
For each analyte, the spectra were processed using a
stepwise selection of wave numbers giving the optimal least
squares correlation between the measured mid-infrared
signal and the analyte concentration measured by the
reference method. At each step of the analysis, a partial
least square regression was evaluated by average cross-
validation. Wave numbers showing no or a small correlation
between the mid-infrared signal and measured concentra-
tion were excluded. The detection of the sample outliers was
performed by leaving-one-out analysis, whereby calibration
samples that deviated by more than 3.5 standard deviations
from their measured concentration were excluded from the
calibration set.
Algorithms for the quantification of DPPC and sphin-
gomyelin were developed chemometrically to produce
adequate correlation coefficients between the reference
values and the associated computed values.
A more detailed overview of the stepwise calibration
procedure is given in Appendix S1 in the online supplement
section and has previously been published (23,24).
Study phase two: L/S analyses
Infants with a gestational age from 24 to 31 completed
weeks were eligible. Oropharyngeal secretion samples
(30–100 lL) were secured from between the root of the
tongue and the cheek with a 1-mL syringe within a few
minutes after birth. Gastric aspirate samples (0.3–2.5 mL)
were drawn within half an hour after birth using a feeding
tube attached to a 10-mL syringe or a suction catheter (Ch
6) connected to a tracheal suction set. The feeding tube or
suction catheters were placed while establishing nCPAP
for
respiratory
stabilisation
or
intubation.
Immediate
treatment
with
nCPAP
was
the
primary
method
of
respiratory stabilisation at birth, and intubation was only
carried out for resuscitation. Gastric aspirate and oropha-
ryngeal
secretion,
as
detailed
in
the
section
about
pre-analytical
handling
above,
were
stored
at
_20°C
within one hour of birth for later analyses by FTIR
spectroscopy.
RDS was diagnosed when at least two of the four
classical symptoms were present: the need for supplemen-
tal oxygen, tachypnoea, intercostal retractions and grunt-
ing, and a chest x-ray consistent with RDS excluded other
causes of respiratory distress. The severity of RDS was
graded in four groups (19). It was graded as non-RDS if
the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) was <0.40 in
maximal nine hours after birth, with no need for supple-
mental oxygen later on. Mild RDS was when the FiO2 was
0.22–0.40 for more than nine hours after birth, but there
was no need for surfactant or mechanical ventilation.
Moderate RDS was the need for surfactant or FiO2 >0.40,
but no mechanical ventilation. Severe RDS was the need
for mechanical ventilation within the five-day study. FiO2
was registered every hour for the first 24 hours and every

 second hour for the following 48 hours and twice on days
4 and 5.
The calculation of the L/S values by the DPPC and
sphingomyelin algorithms was performed without any
knowledge of the clinical outcomes.
Different factors in addition to the neonatal treatment of
lung symptoms are known to influence the development of
RDS and possibly also surfactant analyses. The factors
considered in the following include the following: multiple
births, birth by Caesarean section, gestational diabetes,
asphyxia, antenatal steroid treatment and contamination with
blood, meconium and mucus and viscous gastric aspirate.
Statistical analysis
We estimated that 135 infants with a gestational age of 24–
31 weeks, with an estimated 55 with RDS (19), would be
sufficient to evaluate the method.
We chose cut-off values that maximised the sum of the
sensitivity and specificity to improve the usability of L/S to
diagnose RDS (25). The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for
sensitivity and specificity were calculated. The L/S data
were stratified into groups based on gestational ages of 24–
25, 26–29 and 30–31 weeks.
Pearson’s chi-square test was used to examine the
possible influence of Caesarean section on the accuracy of
L/S as a predictor of RDS and the sensitivity of L/S versus
gestational age. Two-tailed p values of <0.05 were consid-
ered to indicate statistical significance.
RESULTS
Infants were enrolled in the second phase of the study from
March 2014 to January 2015 from eight Danish and three
Swedish neonatal units. Gastric aspirate samples were
obtained from 143 of the 144 enrolled infants. Seven cases
were excluded – four due to prophylactic surfactant treat-
ment before sampling, two due to severe infections and one
due to congenital lung malformation – leaving 136 infants
with gastric aspirates in the final cohort. Oropharyngeal
secretions were available from 59 infants. For 58 infants,
oropharyngeal secretions were available inaddition to gastric
aspirate, and for one infant, only oropharyngeal secretion
was available. Of the included 136 infants, seven infants (5%)
died before the end of the five-day study period.
Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the infants
who had gastric aspirates included in the analyses.
In Figure 1, the L/S values from the gastric aspirates are
compared with the development of RDS. RDS developed in
61 (45%) of the 136 infants and was classified as mild in 10
(16%), as moderate in 31 (51%) and as severe in 20 (33%).
The optimal cut-off value (25) of L/S was 2.2. The
developed L/S method as a predictor of RDS from gastric
aspirate had a sensitivity of 92% (95% CI: 82–97), a

 specificity of 73% (95% CI 62–83), a positive predictive
value of 74% (95% CI: 66–85) and a negative predictive
value of 92% (95% CI: 82–97). Gestational age was 24–
25 weeks for 12 infants (9%), 26–29 weeks for 62 infants
(46%) and 30–31 weeks for a further 62 infants (46%). The
sensitivity was high in all three gestational age groups, and
only one or two infants with RDS in each group had an L/S
above the cut-off 2.2. Gestational age and L/S with different
degrees of RDS severity are shown in Table 2. Infants
without RDS had L/S below 2.2 in 20 cases: eight of these
(40%) needed extra oxygen and no infants diagnosed
without RDS, with an L/S above 3.2. required extra oxygen.
One set of triplets and 19 pairs of twins were included in
the study: the triplets and 12 of the 19 pairs of twins
accounted for the 65% of the multiple births born by
Caesarean section. In 12 pairs, the lowest L/S was found in
the second twin, while in one pair, the L/S was the same in
both twins. Twins and triplets were correctly diagnosed
in 81% of cases compared with 82% of all infants in the
cohort.
The RDS predictions from L/S were significantly more
precise with a p value of just below 0.05 in infants born by
the vaginal route, which accounted for 37% of the deliver-
ies, than by Caesarean section (Table 3a and b). None of the
mothers of the included infants had gestational diabetes. No
difference in specificity was found between the infants with
Apgar scores of 10 and lower scores at five minutes. L/S
predicted the development of RDS with the same precision
in cases with and without antenatal corticosteroid treat-
ment. Gastric aspirate was visually contaminated with
blood in 32 (24%) of the cases. In 29 of these 32 cases,
L/S correctly diagnosed the development of RDS. In
addition, one case with RDS and two cases without RDS
and blood contamination of the gastric aspirates were
diagnosed incorrectly. Visual meconium contamination of
the gastric aspirate was only seen in four cases, and all were
diagnosed accurately without RDS. Mucus was found in
different amounts in about half of the samples. Viscous
gastric aspirate was not seen in any case.
The optimal cut-off value (25) of L/S in oropharyngeal
secretion was 3.7. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive
values are shown in Table 4.
Predicting RDS using the L/S ratio was significantly
better than using the gestational age as a predictive
indicator (Table 5a). When gestational age was used as a
guide for predicting RDS, 43 (70%) of the 61 infants with
RDS had a gestational age of less than 30 weeks, compared
to 56 (92%) of the 61 infants with L/S below the cut-off
value when L/S was used to predict RDS. Both sensitivity
and specificity were highest when predicted by L/S.
Table 5b shows that the age from birth was median of six
hours before the infants were treated with surfactant based
on the clinical observations.
DISCUSSION
For more than 50 years, clinicians have searched for a test
to determine lung maturity in premature infants, and from
the 1970s, several laboratory tests have been developed.
Only a few are still in use, and they all have significant
drawbacks, such as lack of specificity and sensitivity or a
demand for skilled laboratory personnel and a long delay
before the test results are available. Therefore, there is still
an urgent unmet need for a quick and safe test to identify

 which newborn infants require surfactant. We have devel-
oped a fast method that does not require highly trained
laboratory personnel and can be further developed to a
point-of-care test. We chose to use gastric aspirates and
oropharyngeal secretions, which are easy to obtain, and a
process that does not require the use of complicated
reagents.
More clinical factors may influence the development of
RDS and the lung maturity test. For example, the second
twin often has a lower L/S than the first-born infant. This
tendency is also seen in the actual study.
Blood contamination of the gastric aspirate does not
appear to influence measurements of L/S. This could be due
to phosphatidylcholine being measured as DPPC, which is
only sparsely present in blood and meconium. Gastric
aspirates were contaminated with meconium in four cases.
This was too few to draw conclusions about the effect,
although L/S accurately predicted RDS in all cases. As
mentioned, we did not analyse the mucus in gastric
aspirates. Detailed lipid analyses of mucus in fresh, frozen
and thawed gastric aspirate are planned before the L/S
analysis is introduced as a bedside test. Viscous gastric
aspirate was not a problem in the actual study, and it is
probable that the phenomenon is only seen at term.
Predicting RDS by L/S analyses of gastric aspirate was
significantly poorer in infants born by Caesarean section
compared to those born through the vaginal route. A
possible explanation is that L/S in gastric aspirate after
Caesarean section originates from a mix of amniotic fluid
and newly produced lung fluid, both with different L/S, in
contrast to L/S in gastric aspirate from infants born
vaginally. We found it conceivable that swallowed amniotic
fluid to some degree may be squeezed out of the stomach
during natural birth as opposed to birth by Caesarean
section. Accordingly, gastric aspirate obtained immediately
after a vaginal birth may contain a higher proportion of
newly swallowed fluid from the lungs.
The
actual
L/S
test
was
found
to
have
a
lower
specificity than sensitivity, and we found it likely that this
might have been mainly explained by the fact that all the
included infants were stabilised with nCPAP within a few
minutes of birth. The efficacy of nCPAP may alleviate or
mask symptoms of RDS, making the diagnosis of RDS
challenging, but it would be unethical to withhold treat-
ment with nCPAP. In our study, 40% of the infants with
non-RDS and L/S values below the cut-off required
supplemental oxygen during the first nine hours of life,
while infants with non-RDS and higher L/S values had no
need for oxygen. This makes it probable that some infants
with low L/S values, who were graded as non-RDS,
actually had subclinical surfactant deficiency. It has also
been shown that nCPAP can increase L/S in repeated
hypopharyngeal secretions (26). We previously developed
two different methods for early diagnosis of RDS on
gastric aspirate from infants similar to the population in
the present study receiving early nCPAP (18,19). These
previously developed tests, like our new method, had
specificity that was lower than sensitivity, supporting the
suggestion that nCPAP may mask less pronounced sur-
factant deficiency.
The analysis of gestational age and L/S in the different
classifications of RDS supports the conclusion that our
method correctly predicted the pulmonary outcome in
these groups. Gestational age and L/S were lower in all
groups of RDS compared to non-RDS. What is also
remarkable is that there was no distinct correlation between
gestational age and L/S, probably reflecting that gestational
age only accounted for a smaller fraction of the total
variation in the result of the lung maturity test (20,27). This
was also supported by the higher sensitivity and specificity
of L/S compared to gestational age when used as a
predictor of RDS. Surfactant treatment in the actual study,
as judged by clinical observations, was given after a median
of six hours and only four infants were treated an hour or
less after birth. This indicates that fast determination of L/S
by a bedside test is likely to allow earlier diagnosis of RDS
and earlier rescue treatment with surfactant compared to
rescue surfactant
treatment based
on routine clinical
criteria.
L/S varied in amniotic fluid, depending on the locations
it was sampled from, and it had the strongest correlation
with the development of RDS when it was taken near to the
infant’s mouth (28). Consequently, we also analysed L/S in
oropharyngeal secretion. The fluid was taken noninvasively
and close to the oral cavity. The specificity of L/S in the
oropharyngeal secretions was equal to the specificity in the
gastric aspirates, but the sensitivity for the oropharyngeal
secretions was lower than for the gastric aspirates. We
expect that the sampling technique can be optimised and
that fresh oropharyngeal secretions and gastric aspirates
will be easier to process than frozen ones. Stichtenoth et al.
(29) measured surface tension in upper airway aspirates and

Rapid test for lung maturity
 found acceptable correlations to lung maturity. However,
the processing time was rather long and the dilution of the
surfactant may have interfered with the surface tension
measurements. Others have also successfully performed
L/S analyses on hypopharyngeal secretions (14,26), but by
using methods that were slower and less accurate. The use
of spectroscopy to measure L/S on amniotic fluid was
initially explored by Liu et al. (30). This method held
promise for rapid measurements of lung maturity in the
laboratory, but the low accuracy of the reference method,
which was carried out by thin-layer chromatography,
proved to be a fundamental problem (16). The increased
foetal loss after amniocentesis, together with improvements
in newborn respiratory care, obviates wide use of the
method.
The spectroscopic part of our L/S method was very rapid,
but at present, the method is still a laboratory test. To
contribute to clinical decision-making, results should be
available within minutes after birth and a bedside version of
the test is needed for our method to become useful in
clinical settings. A new stand-alone device is currently being
developed with the aim that it will be used as a point-of-
care test in neonatal wards, using custom-made equipment
for easy sampling and processing of gastric aspirate and
potentially oropharyngeal secretions. The bedside test will
be introduced in a randomised study, which will measure
the benefit of this new method on clinical outcomes
compared to standard treatment.
CONCLUSION
We have developed a rapid test to measure lung maturity on
small volumes of gastric aspirate and oropharyngeal secre-
tion in premature infants at birth. This test could help
identify which infants will benefit from very early surfactant
treatment, with the potential to significantly improve
clinical outcomes resulting in less severe RDS, less need
of mechanical ventilation and oxygen and less severe
bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
