In 2016, over 5 million reconstructive procedures
were performed in the United States. The recent
successes of clinical vascularized composite allo-
transplantations, hand and face transplantations
included, established the tremendous potential of
these
life-enhancing
reconstructions.
Neverthe-
less,
due
to
limited
availability
and
lifelong
immunosuppression, application is limited. Long-

may
increase the availability of esthetically compatible

complete
HLA
matching,
reducing the risk of rejection and the immunosup-

burden.
The
study
purpose
was
to
develop efficient protocols for the cryopreserva-
tion
and
transplantation
of
a
complete
rodent
limb. Directional freezing is a method in which a
sample is cooled at a constant-velocity linear tem-
perature gradient, enabling precise control of the
process and ice crystal formation. Vitrification is
an alternative cryopreservation method in which
the sample solidifies without the formation of ice
crystals. Testing both methods on a rat hindlimb
composite tissue transplantation model, we found
reliable, reproducible, and stable ways to preserve
composite
tissue.
We
believe
that
with
further
research and development, cryopreservation may
lead to composite tissue “banks.” This may lead
to a paradigm shift from few and far apart emer-
gent
surgeries
to
wide-scale,
well-planned,
and
better-controlled elective surgeries.

Introduction
In 2016, over 5 million reconstructive procedures were
performed in the United States due to surgical excision
of tumors, accidents, and congenital malformations (1).
The
need
to
replace
“like
with
like”
guides
the
reconstructive surgeons in choosing the proper method
and
means
of
reconstruction.
Therefore,
composite
defects, consisting of several tissues and their respective
mechanical and physiological properties, must ideally be
reconstructed
with
their
matching
counterparts.
The
recent success of clinical vascular composite allotrans-
plantation (VCA) attests to the fact that composite tissue
allografts have tremendous potential in these life-enhan-
cing reconstructions (2).
The concept of VCA for restoration of congenital or
acquired deformities is not new. In the history of medi-
cine
there
are
several
well-documented
cases
that
demonstrate the developing concept of reconstructive
transplantation medicine (3–7). One such account is “The
Legend of the Black Leg (Leggenda Aurea),” about the
twins Cosmos and Damian, who transplanted the leg of
a man with that of an Ethiopian in 348 AD (8). In 1957,
Peacock et al (8,9) coined the term “composite tissue
allograft” and in 1964, Robert Gilbert (10) performed the
first hand transplantation (HTx) in Ecuador. In the 1990s,
the advent of more potent immunosuppressants rekin-
dled the interest leading to successful trials in rodents
and large animal VCA models (3,6). In November 1997,
in Louisville, Kentucky the 1st International Symposium
on VCA was held. The next two HTx were performed in
1998 by pioneers Dubernard et al (11–13) in France, and
in 1999 by Warren Breidenbach (14) in the United States,
thus initiating the modern era of reconstructive HTx (7).
Since 1998 over 100 HTx and 30 face transplants have
been reported (15).
VCA unifies the principles of reconstructive microsurgery
and transplant surgery. It achieves the goals of absolute
correction of a defect with anatomically and physiologi-
cally identical tissue, with none of the issues of donor
site morbidity associated with autologous tissue transfer.
Nevertheless, its widespread use is hindered by its
extreme immunogenicity, severe psychological implica-
tions, and graft availability (15,16).

 VCA is primarily a procedure aimed at improving the
recipients’ quality of life and psychological well-being.
Since
candidates
considering
VCA
present
no
life-
threatening illness, their motivation is gaining improved
functional outcomes, occupational attainment, improved
body image, and restored touch. Patients must accept a
new graft while adapting to their loss of a part of their
body that was unique to them (17). This requires alter-
ations in their sense of self, how the graft fits in with
their body image, and ultimately acceptance of the allo-
graft as part of themselves (18). Better aesthetic match
of the graft to the recipient may ameliorate the devastat-
ing psychological burden.
As soon as a suitable graft is removed from an organ
donor and placed on ice for evaluation, the clock starts
ticking and the longer it takes for the organ to reach a
recipient the lower the chances for it to be transplanted.
Many grafts do not reach the transplantation recipient in
time and are discarded without being used due to limita-
tions of delivery distances and reach of the Organ Pro-
curement and Transplantation Network. No data are
available for composite allografts, but we can infer from
solid organ transplantation data. According to the U.S
Department of Health and Human Services, less than
10% of patients’ needs for transplantable organs are
being met, leading to many patients dying while waiting
for a suitable organ for transplantation (7).
Cryobiologists have long sought to cryopreserve biological
samples ranging from single cells to complex organs and
whole animals (19–24). There are many types of damage
that are inflicted on cells and complex tissues during the
freezing processes such as (i) cell membrane chilling
injury: a loss of membrane elasticity due to lipid phase
transition caused by liquid-crystal to crystal-gel form trig-
gered by the temperature reduction (25–27), (ii) cell death
due to intracellular ice crystals formation (27), (iii) mechani-
cal damages caused by ice crystals engulfing cells, with
tissue and cell rupture due to shearing forces (28,29), and
(iv) tissue and organ damages due to recrystallization of
ice that was melted due to the release of latent heat
when first crystallization occurred during cooling (refreez-
ing) and when thawing is performed (recrystallization)
(30). In addition to damages taking place during the freez-
ing process, there are also thawing-related damages.
Most of this damage results from recrystallization due to
the endothermic process of slow thawing (31). This
becomes a major concern when thawing large samples in
general and even more so when thawing complex large
samples such as large tissues and organs, since the inner
part of the sample gets warm at a much slower rate than
the exterior part of the sample (32). To date, successful
cryopreservation and thawing of a rat heart model was
accomplished (33). Similarly, a pig liver has been frozen
and when thawed resumed bile production (34). Whole
sheep ovaries that were frozen/thawed and then retrans-
planted back to the ewes resumed hormonal function as
well as oocyte production (35,36). However, freezing and
reimplantation of a whole limb has not yet been done due
to the aforementioned complexities.
Directional freezing (DF) is an advanced method for the
freezing of biological samples. In this method after the
initial seeding stage (in which ice crystals formation is
induced), the sample is advanced at a constant velocity
through a linear temperature gradient enabling precise
control over the freezing process (32,33). Vitrification is
an alternative cryopreservation method in which the sam-
ple solidifies without the formation of ice crystals (31).
We therefore tested the hypothesis that using these
methods will enable composite tissue-friendly cryop-
reservation and transplantation.
Finding a reliable, reproducible, and stable way to pre-
serve
composite
tissue
allografts
may
expand
the
available number of composite tissues, limbs, and solid
organs for transplantation. Expanding the donor pool
may, in turn, enable improved HLA and aesthetic match-
ing. Moreover, the whole approach to VCA may shift
from few and far apart emergent surgeries to wide-scale,
well planned, and controlled elective surgeries.
Materials and Methods
Experimental design
Six rat hindlimbs from three donor rats were harvested.
Tissue samples were taken from the implanted leg when initially har-
vested (fresh control).
The limbs were cryopreserved for 7–30 days: three limbs using DF and
three limbs using vitrification.
Prior to transplantation (immediately after thawing/warming), tissue sam-
ples were taken again.
Group A (n = 3 rats) were transplanted with DF limbs, and Group B
(n = 3 rats) were transplanted with vitrified limbs.
Both groups underwent hindlimb transplantation, followed by clinical
monitoring of the limb consisting of visual and tactile inspection of the
tissues by the surgeon while performing the transplantation and immedi-
ately postoperatively, with daily visual inspection of the limb.
The animals were randomly assigned to be euthanized on postoperative
day (POD) 1, 2, and 3 and tissue samples were taken from the implanted
limb.
All tissue samples taken were prepared and studied following standard
hematoxylin and eosin staining.
Skin cells (fibroblast-like cells) were grown in culture for 2 weeks.
Animals
Male, �12-week-old, inbred Lewis (RT1 l) rats weighing 250–300 g were
used as donors and recipients of limb heterotrophic isotransplantations.
All rats were followed after the transplantation daily for signs of suffering

 and treated accordingly. The rats’ behavior following transplantations of a
cryopreserved limb was similar to rats transplanted with a fresh limb. All
of the procedures using animals were performed under the institutional
ethical committee guidelines and approval.
Surgical procedure: limb harvesting
Three rats were used as donors. Anesthesia was induced by inhalation
of Isoflorane 2% and oxygen at a flow rate of 5 L/min in an induction
cage. Anesthesia was maintained with inhalant 1–2% isoflurane. The
donor surgical site was prepared and a skin incision was made around
the circumference of the right hindlimb at the level of the inguinal liga-
ment. Beginning laterally, the skin of the upper thigh was mobilized to
expose the biceps femoris. The biceps femoris was then leaving a suffi-
cient edge of residual tissue for later repair. The biceps was reflected to
expose the sciatic nerve within the stifle fossa. The sciatic nerve was
dissected out proximally to the point of emergence from below the glu-
teus muscle, preserving mesoneural tissue. The sciatic nerve was tran-
sected proximally after a tag suture of 10–0 nylon was placed. The
femoral vessels were isolated from the inguinal ligament to the level of
the epigastric takeoff. All muscle groups were then sharply divided
slightly proximal to the level of the midfemur. The femoral vessels were
then clamped above the previously placed suture tags and transected.
Using a 22-gauge angiocatheter, approximately 5 mL of warm saline
0.9% and 50 U of heparin were manually perfused through the femoral
artery, until the venous effluent was clear. The osteotomy was per-
formed at the midfemur. Once detached, the donor limb (graft) was
wrapped in moist gauze and underwent either DF or vitrification. The
donor animal was euthanized.
Directional freezing procedure
The DF apparatus is based on two brass blocks, which are thermal-con-
ducting masses and can be cooled or warmed to any desired tempera-
ture at any cooling or warming rate. The biological material is placed in
tight contact between the two blocks. Depending upon the temperature
of the blocks, the contact may allow DF by generation of one or more
controlled thermal gradients within the object, without the need to move
the object itself. The cost of the DF prototype is estimated to be $30–
40K and the operation is around $100/limb.
If not mentioned differently, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
The freezing solution was composed of 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO),
10% fetal bovine serum, and 0.5 M Trehalose in M-199 medium (Biologi-
cal Industries, Beit Haemek, Israel). Five milliliters of the freezing solution
was manually perfused during 8 min into the harvested hindlimb. The leg
was inserted into a cryobag (CryoStore CS250; Origen Biomedical, Aus-
tin, TX) that was filled with the freezing solution. The bag was frozen
using a directional freezing device (A.A. Technologies, Tel Aviv, Israel)
(Figure 1A–C). Seeding was performed at �7°C, and the cooling rate was
set to 0.5°C/min with a temperature gradient of 0.5°C/cm; freezing has
ended when the temperature has reached �70°C. After freezing has
ended, the bags were stored at �80°C in a Thermo FormaTM freezer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) for 7–30 days.
Thawing procedure
The frozen bag was inserted into a water bath heated to 65°C until the
outer frozen layer is thawed while the leg inside is still frozen (about 2–
3 min). The bag was then opened and the frozen leg was taken out and
inserted into 50 mL of M-199 (Biological Industries) supplemented with
1 M sucrose warmed to 38°C. After the leg was completely thawed, it
was manually perfused again with 3 mL of M-199 (Biological Industries)
with 0.5 M sucrose for 5 min.
Vitrification procedure
The harvested leg was manually perfused during 2 min with each of the
following solutions:
(1) 2 mL of 1.6% DMSO, 1.6% ethylene glycol (EG), 0.1 M Trehalose in
M-199 (Biological Industries).
(2) 2 mL of 4.8% DMSO, 4.8% EG, 0.3 M Trehalose in M-199 (Biologi-
cal Industries).
(3) 2 mL of 8% DMSO, 8% EG, 0.5 M Trehalose in M-199 (Biological
Industries).
(4) 2 mL of 16% DMSO, 16% EG, 1 M Trehalose I M-199 (Biological
Industries).
(5) 2 mL of 25% DMSO, 25% EG, 0.5 M Trehalose, 3% human serum
albumin (Akron Biotech, Boca Raton, FL).
After perfusion ended, the leg was inserted into an empty cryobag
(CryoStore CS250; Origen Biomedical) that was heat sealed with minimal
air in it. The bag was then inserted into LN slush (�208°C) using the Vit-
Master device (IMT, Nes-Ziona, Israel). The bag was then stored in a LN
Dewar for 7–30 days.
Warming procedure
The bag was taken out of the LN Dewar and held in the air for 10 s. The
bag was then opened and the leg was removed into 50 mL of M-199
(Biological Industries) supplemented with 1 M sucrose warmed to 38°C
until the leg is completely warmed.
The leg was then perfused manually during 5 min with the following
solutions:
(1) 3 mL of 1 M sucrose in M-199 (Biological Industries).
(2) 3 mL of 0.5 M sucrose in M-199 (Biological Industries).
(3) 3 mL of M-199 (Biological Industries).
Surgical procedure: transplant
Six rats were used as recipients. The animal was anesthetized and pre-
pared for surgery. An oblique incision, approximately 1.5 cm in length,
was made on the hip, slightly superior to the leg with exposure and divi-
sion of the femoral vessels occurring further distally to preserve ade-
quate length for approximation with the donor limb. The donor limb was
transplanted by performing vascular anastomoses with simple inter-
rupted sutures of 10–0 nylon. Muscle groups were approximated to the
abdominal wall and with 6–0 Prolene. Lactated Ringer’s solution (5 mL,
IP) was administered. The skin was closed with interrupted 4–0 nylon
sutures.
Preparation of skin cultures
Rat thigh skin was removed under sterile conditions from limbs that
were frozen by either DF or vitrification, stored under �80 for 7–30 days,
and thawed/warmed. Tissue was washed with phosphate-buffered saline
to remove excess blood cells. Skin was minced into small fragments and
cells were isolated by trypsin–ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA)
solution (0.25% trypsin-EDTA). Digestion was repeated three times at
room temperature, at gentle stirring for 30 min. Digested skin was cen-
trifuged at 300g and cell pellet was seeded on gelatin-coated tissue cul-
ture plates. Skin cells were cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium
+ 10% fetal calf serum + gentamicin (25 lg/mL) in a humidified atmo-
sphere of 5% CO2–95% air at 37°C. Medium was changed every
3 days.
Sample treatment
Limbs were stored at �80°C in a Thermo Forma
TM freezer (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) for 7–30 days. Samples were taken immediately prior to

 transplantation or following the animals’ euthanizing, in order to avoid
triggering limb autophagia and to minimize unnecessary suffering.
Results
Six recipient rats (male, Lewis, �12 weeks old) each
received a single frozen/thawed or vitrified/warmed hin-
dlimb transplantation from three donor rats (male, Lewis,
12 weeks old) (Figure 2A).
At the time of transplantation, thawed or warmed vessel
integrity, color, and pliability were indistinguishable from
the fresh recipient vessels (Figure 3). Anastomosis pro-
ceeded without difficulty with distal perfusion estab-
lished as demonstrated by both color (Figure 2B) and
punctate bleeding of the toes (Figure 2C-D).
All limbs survived until planned extraction. On daily
inspection, edema was most significant at POD 1 and
started resolving toward POD 3, as expected. No signs

 of ischemia were noted. At the time of planned extrac-
tion (POD 1, 2, and 3), bleeding was noted from the
transplanted limb, most evident in vessels anastomosed
and muscles, which seemed viable.
On histology of freshly thawed/warmed, prior to trans-
plantation, limbs had viable muscle, skin, and blood ves-
sels as can be concluded from preservation of histological
structure, nuclei, and uniform cell size (Figure 4).

Cryopreservation of composite tissue may be consid-
ered the “holy grail” of transplantation surgery and, to a
wider
extent,
reconstructive
surgery.
Numerous
attempts have been made and a most recent report by
Wang et al (37) performed on a rat hindlimb as our own
acutely
illustrates
the
challenges
and
incremental
advances of the field. In the report, attempts to trans-
plant limbs above the knee failed immediately due to
apparent inability to restore blood flow to the thawed
limb. Success was described only in small transplants
below the level of the ankle (Syme’s amputation). These

Rat Hindlimb Cryopreservation & Transplant
 results correlate with our own clinical experience with
small nonvascularized composite transplants such as fin-
gertips and ear helical grafts employed for hundreds of
years and improved with the use of antibiotics and cold
transport.
In contrast to this report (37), we found that composite
tissue, comprising a midfemor above-knee amputation,
can be cryopreserved using either DF or vitrification.
Moreover, at POD 3 the composite vascularized grafts
were clinically viable. Histologically, tissue and cells
retained structure and normal appearance with no direct
or indirect signs of cell death, and culture of cells isolated
from the skin of a cryopreserved limb was successful,
producing viable fibroblast-like cells. We conclude that rat
hindlimbs frozen by DF or vitrified can be transplanted
using the same techniques that are applied for fresh rat
hindlimb transplantation, enabling further research and
development of hindlimb cryopreservation technology
using our reproducible animal model.
Our results advance on previous success in DF cryop-
reservation using noncytotoxic cryoprotectants such as
that of whole heart cryopreservation published by Elami
et al (34); whole liver cryopreservation published by Gav-
ish et al (35); and whole ovaries published by Arav et al
(36). In the aforementioned studies, a relatively homoge-
neous tissue was cryopreserved and after thawing,
resumed its dedicated function, demonstrating the safe
profile of DF. However, the physical complexity of differ-
ent tissue and interfaces within a composite graft was
not addressed. This complexity of cryogenic properties
was tested by choosing a composite tissue structure
such as a rat hindlimb composed of muscle, blood ves-
sels, bone, bone marrow, nerve, and connective tissue.
The viability of the fibroblast-like cells in isolated skin of cry-
opreserved limb further grown in culture is a significant find-
ing in that these cells survived individually the potential
physical damage of cell membrane chilling injury (24–26)
and mechanical damages caused by ice crystals (27,28).
The muscle tissue survived rupture due to shearing forces
(29) and cell death due to ice crystallization during cooling
(refreezing) and thawing (recrystallization) (34).
The limitations of our study include the small sample size
and relatively short follow-up. These were decisions
made to limit the number of animals euthanized in the
experiment, given our assumption that we are searching
for a large effect. A larger number of animals and longer
follow-up might have uncovered further effects of the cry-
opreservation process, possibly in conjunction, and there-
fore confounded by normal inflammation and wound
healing. The cryopreservation process may affect the
immunogenicity of the graft. However, it is still unclear
what the effect will be since different outcomes were
found when this was evaluated in different studies; in
some cases the immunogenicity has decreased, in some
it was increased, and in some it was unchanged. Never-
theless, the time required for donor and recipient match-
ing will not be an obstacle anymore once cryobanking is
achieved (38–43).

 In conclusion, we have demonstrated the successful cry-
opreservation
followed
by
transplantation
of
a
rat
hindlimb as a research model for composite tissue trans-
plantation. Our findings and model may be used for fur-
ther research and development of DF and verification as
a means of cryopreserving larger composite tissue and
whole limbs. It is our belief that this course of research
may provide a reliable, reproducible, and stable way to
preserve composite tissue allografts. This will pave the
way for composite tissue, limb, and even organ “banks,”
increasing availability for transplantation, and expanding
the clinical indications creating a true paradigm shift from
few and far apart emergent surgeries to wide-scale, well-
planned, and better-controlled elective surgeries.
