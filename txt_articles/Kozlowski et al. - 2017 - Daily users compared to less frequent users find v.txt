We assessed the roles of perceived satisfaction and perceived danger and vaping-product-type as correlates of
more frequent use of vaping products. In a baseline assessment of a longitudinal study of US Army Reserve/Na-
tional Guard Soldiers and their partners (New York State, USA, 2014–2016), participants were asked about cur-
rent use of vaping products (e-cigarettes) and perceived satisfaction and danger in comparison to cigarettes as
well as type of product used. Fisher-exact tests and multiple ordinal logistic regressions were used. In multivar-
iable and univariate models, more perceived satisfaction, less perceived danger, and use of non-cig-alike products
were associated with more frequent use of vaping products (ps b 0.05, two-tailed). For self-selected, more fre-
quent adult users, e-cigs can be at least as satisfying as cigarettes and often more satisfying and are perceived
as less dangerous than cigarettes. Non-cig-alike products were more likely in daily users. Some concern that e-
cigs are a gateway to cigarettes arises from assuming that e-cigs may not be as reinforcing and pleasurable as cig-
arettes. These results indicate that accurate perception of comparative risk and use of more effective-nicotine de-
livery product can produce for some users a highly-satisfying alternative to cigarettes.

1. Introduction
The rising use of vaping products (i.e., e-cigarettes, electronic ciga-
rettes and other vaping products) has been of great interest to public
health authorities (Royal College of Physicians, 2016). Use of these
products has increased dramatically (Miech et al., 2016). Among high
school students in the United States, past 30 day use of e-cigarettes
rose from 1.5% in 2011 to 16.0% in 2015 (Singh et al., 2016). One concern
has been that vaping products could be serving as a gateway to the up-
take of cigarette use (Bell and Keane, 2014; Kozlowski and Warner,
2017). This concern is supported by the belief that these products are
not as satisfying to smokers as cigarettes and that cigarettes would pro-
vide a much more satisfying experience. One report of use of e-ciga-
rettes by college students in New York State found that “enjoyment”
was a strong correlate of daily use (Saddleson et al., 2016). We wanted
to further explore the role of enjoyment or satisfaction from the product
as a predictor of more frequent use. To do so, we employed direct
comparative questions (Kozlowski et al., 2000; Kozlowski et al.,
1989b) as an efficient technique for assessing how users compared
the satisfaction they received from smoking cigarettes with the satisfac-
tion from vaping products.
Though not without risk, e-cigarettes had been judged to be at
least 90% less harmful than cigarettes (McNeill et al., 2015; Nutt et
al., 2014). In contrast, a national survey showed that about 50% of
adults report that e-cigarettes are at least as harmful as cigarettes
(Kiviniemi and Kozlowski, 2015). Another national survey has found
that from 2012 to 2015, the percentage of adults who reported e-cig-
arettes as less harmful than cigarettes has decreased, indicating a
trend toward inaccurate beliefs being more common (Majeed et al.,
2016). Given the widespread confusion about the dangers of vaping
compared to cigarettes (Tan et al., 2016; Zulkifli et al., 2016), we
also wanted to explore the relation of perceived danger to likelihood
of use.
In addition to the differences in perception that might reasonably in-
fluence use of vaping products, we wanted to assess the role of product
differences in influencing frequency of use. The nature of vaping prod-
ucts has been changing greatly, with evidence that the early, so called
first generation devices that resembled cigarettes (also known as cig-
alike products) generally deliver lower levels of nicotine to the user
than new open systems with high-capacity batteries and electronic cir-
cuits linked to refillable atomizers (Farsalinos et al., 2014). To the extent

 nicotine delivery is a determinant of use, we expected that the second
generation products would be more likely to be used by the more fre-
quent users.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Sample
The Operation: SAFETY Study (Soldiers And Families Excelling
Through the Years) is a longitudinal research study examining the
health and well-being of U.S. Army Reserve/National Guard Soldiers
and their partners (N = 411 couples). More details on the Operation:
SAFETY project are available in Heavey et al. (2017). Participants used
a self-guided, computer-assisted self-interview, conducted between
August 2014 and January 2016, to respond to all questionnaires. Assess-
ments take approximately 2–3 h and can occur at the University at Buf-
falo Center for Health Research or online via a secure assessment portal.
This study is approved by the University at Buffalo Institutional Review
Board and informed consent was obtained. For this report, we used a
subsample of the overall sample based upon current use of e-cigarettes.
There were 105 adults (53 males, 52 females) 18.5 to 44.9 years old
(mean = 30.2; SD = 6.56). Race/ethnicity was predominately Non-His-
panic White (83%) with 8% Non-Hispanic Black, 6% Hispanic and 8%
other. Participants were well educated with the majority having had
some college experience (64%) or completion of a college degree
(15%) while the remaining held high school diplomas (18%) or less ed-
ucation (3%).
2.2. Measures
Cigarette smoking was assessed using two questions: “In your entire
life, have you ever smoked 100 cigarettes?” (Answers: Yes or No.) Those
who said Yes were asked: “Do you currently smoke cigarettes? (An-
swers: No, I quit smoking or Yes, I currently smoke cigarettes.)
All participants were asked: “In your entire life, have you ever used
an electronic cigarette, an e-cigarette, or vaping device (these battery-
powered devices produce vapor, often with nicotine, instead of
smoke)? There are many types of e-cigarettes. Some common brands
include Smoking Everywhere, NJOY, Blu, Vapor King, Pax, and Firefly.”
(Answers: Yes or No.) Those who answered Yes were asked: “Do you
currently use e-cigarettes or a vaping device?” (Answers: every day
(Daily users = scored 3), some days (Not Daily users = 2), not at all
(Triers = 1)).
Initially, only Daily users and Not Daily users of e-cigarettes were
asked the following questions, but then the procedure was changed to
ask these questions also of the Triers who were not using currently.
This means that the true percentage of those who were not current
users of e-cigarettes is under-estimated: 147 participants who were Tri-
ers were not asked the perceived satisfaction or perceived danger ques-
tions. These were the key questions:
Is your favorite e-cigarette or vaping device more or less satisfying
than your favorite cigarette? Answers scored from 1 to 5, with 1) “My
favorite e-cig or vaping device is much less satisfying than my favorite
cigarette,” [the sentences were written out in full, but the only wording
change is indicated in the following], 2) “… a little less …”, 3) “… about
as… “, 4) “…a little more…”, 5) …much more…”.
Is your favorite e-cigarette or vaping device more or less dangerous
for your health than your favorite cigarette? Answers scored 1 to 5, with
1) “My favorite e-cig or vaping device is much less dangerous than my
favorite cigarette,” [all sentences were written out in full, but the only
wording change is indicated in the following], 2) “… a little less…”, 3)
“... about as… “, 4) “… a little more…”, 5) …much more…”.
The next question was open ended: “Name your favorite e-cig or
vaping device (be as specific as you can).”
2.3. Scoring of type of vaping product used
The open-ended responses to type of product used were scored. For
non-current users, most left it blank or said ‘don't know’, sometimes re-
ferring to the fact that they had just tried one once from a friend. Com-
mon products like Blu®, NJoy® were judged likeliest to be cig-a-likes.
Scoring was done by looking at this question only with no reference to
responses to other questions: 67 responses could be scored as to type.
The score employed a two-level distinction: cig-alike (scored 1) or
other than a cig-alike (including mods, tanks, vape pens) (scored 2).
No questions were asked on nicotine use in the products or flavors.
2.4. Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics and Fisher-exact tests (two-tailed) were used.
For the Fisher-exact tests, satisfaction scores were recoded: 1 = about
as satisfying/a little more satisfying/much more satisfying and 2 =
less satisfying/a little less satisfying; danger scores were recoded: 1 =
a little less dangerous/much less dangerous and 2 = about as danger-
ous/a little more dangerous/much more dangerous. Multivariable ordi-
nal logistic regression analyses (Stata 13.1, StataCorp, 4905 Lakeway
Drive, College Station, Texas 77845) were conducted to assess the asso-
ciation between regularity of vaping product usage (Triers = 1, Not
Daily users = 2, and Daily users = 3) and a) perceived satisfaction
from vaping in comparison to cigarettes (scored as indicated in the
question above), b) perceived danger from vaping in comparison to cig-
arettes (scored as indicated in the question above), and 3) the type of
vaping product used.
3. Results
3.1. Evidence of lack of bias in the samples of Triers who were or were not
asked about perceptions
Since initially e-cigarette Triers were not asked about perceived sat-
isfaction or perceived danger, we assessed if these individuals (N =
147) were different from those in this group who were asked the per-
ception questions (N = 61). No statistically-significant differences
were found in age, sex, or education (all ps N 0.05, two-tailed).
3.2. Perceptions of satisfaction
Fig. 1 shows the results in detail and shows that all daily users re-
ported e-cigarettes as at least as satisfying as cigarettes, with 58%
reporting vape as much more satisfying. Fisher exact tests (two-tailed)
were done on recoded data. Satisfaction scores (recoded to e-cigarettes
being about as satisfying as or more satisfying than cigarettes versus less
satisfying than cigarettes) showed greater satisfaction in Daily users
versus Not Daily users (p = 0.001) and Daily users versus Triers
(p b 0.001); no difference between Not Daily users versus Triers =
0.17 (ns.); and greater satisfaction from e-cigarettes when comparing
Any current use (Daily users + Not Daily users) versus Triers p = 0.002.
3.3. Perceptions of danger
Fig. 2 shows that perception of danger from e-cigarettes decreases as
frequency of use increases. Fisher-exact tests were done on recoded
data. Perceived danger was recoded to e-cigarettes being less dangerous
than cigarettes versus as dangerous as or more dangerous than ciga-
rettes. Daily users versus Not Daily users were not different (p =
0.167, (ns.)); Not Daily users were less likely to perceive danger than
were Triers (p = 0.02); any current use (Daily users + Not Daily
users) were less likely than Triers to perceive danger from e-cigarettes
in comparison to cigarette (p = 0.001).

 3.4. Type of product used
Triers were most likely to report using Cig-alike products (84%, 26 of
31). Daily users were less likely (33%, 8 of 24) than Triers to use a Cig-
alike (Fisher exact, p b 0.001); Daily users were less likely (8%, 1 of
12) than Triers to use Cig-alikes (p b 0.01). There was not a reliable dif-
ference (p N 0.05) in use of Cig-alikes between the Daily users and Not
Daily users. Note that many of the Triers (49%) could not be scored as
to type of product tried; 75% of the Not Daily users could be scored;
100% of Daily users could be scored.
3.5. Multivariable models
See Table 1. Increased perceived satisfaction from e-cigarettes (Odds
ratio = 2.14, 95% CL: 1.57–2.91) was associated with greater frequency
of use. Decreased perceived danger from e-cigarettes (Odds ratio =
0.51, 95% CL: 0.32–0.80) was associated with greater frequency of use.
The associations held when the type of product used was added to the
model (although the sample size, especially for Triers decreased consid-
erably), but use of non-cig-alike products were associated with in-
creased frequency of use. When product-type was added to the
model, older participants were found to be somewhat likelier to use e-
cigarettes more frequently, but other associations were comparable to
those found in the model with product-type.
4. Discussion
4.1. Considerable satisfaction possible
This cross-sectional study does demonstrate that many self-selected
daily users of vaping products (here 100% of them) can find these prod-
ucts at least about as satisfying as cigarettes and the majority (58%)
found them to be “much more satisfying than cigarettes.” Some policies
have been influenced by the belief that e-cigarettes are fundamentally
lacking in satisfaction in comparison to cigarettes (Benowitz et al.,
2017) and that there needs to be a push to get smokers to switch to
these products. The belief that vaping does not represent a satisfying
product (in comparison to cigarettes) would also support concerns
that e-cigarette use could constitute a causal ‘gateway’ to cigarettes. A
recent study in individuals with serious mental illness asked about sat-
isfaction from e-cigarettes in comparison to cigarettes on a 5-point
Likert-type scale and found very high satisfaction (averaging “4”) dur-
ing the last 2 weeks of the study (Pratt et al., 2016). The related concept
of “enjoyment” has been found to be an important correlate of regular
use of e-cigarettes (Saddleson et al., 2016). Although there is some indi-
cation of causal gateway effects (e.g., (Barrington-Trimis et al., 2016)),
the effects have been small with limited controls for confounding vari-
ables (Kozlowski and Warner, 2017) and overall evidence for a causal
gateway effect that could have a major effect on public health is uncon-
vincing (Kozlowski and Abrams, 2016; Kozlowski and Warner, 2017;
Saddleson et al., 2015). Evidence arising from secular trends in cigarette
and e-cigarette use does not support that there is a gateway effect
(Kozlowski and Warner, 2017). The multivariable models support that
levels of satisfaction relative to cigarettes are a predictor of frequency
of use of e-cigarettes.
4.2. Perceived danger from e-cigarettes
About half of the public considers that vaping is as dangerous as
smoking cigarettes (Kiviniemi and Kozlowski, 2015; Kozlowski and
Abrams, 2016; Kozlowski and Sweanor, 2016) and this misperception
appears to be increasing (Majeed et al., 2016). Although it is clear that
vaping products are not without risk, it is also clear that they are overall
much less dangerous than cigarettes (Royal College of Physicians,
2016). The current findings suggest that mistaken perceptions of risk

 may be influencing the use of vape as a substitute for smoking, and that
greater awareness of the reduced risk might promote switching to e-
cigarettes.
4.3. Satisfaction is important for any recreational drug product and should
be assessed
It is notable that the major Food and Drug Administration sponsored
multi-million dollar PATH survey when assessing reason for use of e-
cigarettes did not include any measures of satisfaction or enjoyment
(Hyland et al., 2016). Enjoyment or satisfaction for a recreational drug
product is likely to influence the use of the product (Kozlowski et al.,
1989a; Saddleson et al., 2016). Satisfaction is considered associated
with the abuse potential of drug products, and some authorities have
proposed that less harmful nicotine/tobacco products should strive for
only moderate levels of satisfaction (Niaura, 2016). A temporary
smoking-cessation aid might be used if it offered low to moderate satis-
faction. But, to compete with or replace cigarettes as a recreational drug
product high levels of satisfaction are likely very important. The actual
degree to which health harms are still caused by satisfying, less harmful
products (in comparison to cigarettes) should be important in deter-
mining the disadvantages of the development highly satisfying alterna-
tives to cigarettes.
5. Limitations
This is a study of predictors (correlates) of usage in self-selected
users of e-cigarettes. The small sample size, especially of daily users, of
e-cigarettes is a limitation. The sample is not necessarily representative
of adults in the United States. No measures of nicotine usage or flavor-
ings were included. Detailed smoking histories were not available, so
adjustments for heaviness of smoking (when still smoking and if cur-
rently smoking) were not available.
6. Conclusion
This study found that frequency of use of e-cigarettes (vape) was di-
rectly associated with perceived satisfaction and indirectly associated
with perceived danger, both measured in comparison to cigarettes. In
addition, non-Cig-alike vaping products were more likely to be used
by more frequent users. The majority of Daily users of e-cigarettes
found them to be “much more satisfying” than cigarettes and less dan-
gerous than cigarettes. Future studies need to employ measures of sat-
isfaction and perceived harmfulness, and type of product used in
order to assess the use of vaping.
