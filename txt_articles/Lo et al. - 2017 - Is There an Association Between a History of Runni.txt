Objective. Regular physical activity, including running, is recommended based on known cardiovascular and mortality
benefits. However, controversy exists regarding whether running can be harmful to knees. The purpose of this study is
to evaluate the relationship of running with knee pain, radiographic osteoarthritis (OA), and symptomatic OA.
Methods. This was a retrospective cross-sectional study of Osteoarthritis Initiative participants (2004–2014) with knee
radiograph readings, symptom assessments, and completed lifetime physical activity surveys. Using logistic regres-
sion, we evaluated the association of history of leisure running with the outcomes of frequent knee pain, radiographic
OA, and symptomatic OA. Symptomatic OA required at least 1 knee with both radiographic OA and pain.
Results. Of 2,637 participants, 55.8% were female, the mean6 SD age was 64.36 8.9 years, and the mean6 SD body mass
index was 28.56 4.9 kg/m2; 29.5% of these participants ran at some time in their lives. Unadjusted odds ratios of pain,
radiographic OA, and symptomatic OA for those prior runners and current runners compared to those who never ran
were 0.83 and 0.71 (P for trend5 0.002), 0.83 and 0.78 (P for trend5 0.01), and 0.81 and 0.64 (P for trend5 0.0006),
respectively. Adjusted models were similar, except radiographic OA results were attenuated.
Conclusion. There is no increased risk of symptomatic knee OA among self-selected runners compared with nonrunners
in a cohort recruited from the community. In those without OA, running does not appear to be detrimental to the knees.
INTRODUCTION
Controversy exists regarding the question of whether running
is harmful to the knee (1). Chronic mechanical overloading
could physically damage structures within the knee. Alterna-
tively, runners generally have a lower body mass index
compared to nonrunners (2), which could be protective
against knee osteoarthritis (OA). Addressing the question of
whether running increases the risk for knee OA is relevant,
as US Department of Health and Human Services 2008 physi-
cal activity guidelines include an option to participate in
vigorous-intensity aerobic activity for 75 minutes per week,
with running as an example of this type of activity (1). This

 recommendation is based on overwhelming evidence that
increased physical activity reduces the risk of cardiovascular
disease and all-cause mortality (3–6).
In the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI; a cohort of people
recruited from the community irrespective of their running
status), more than 2,000 participants completed a survey of
exposure to leisure-time physical activities. Standardized
radiographs and questionnaires were administered to these
participants, allowing for the assessment of radiographic
knee OA and symptomatic knee OA in accordance with uni-
form definitions in these participants. This cross-sectional
study provided a unique opportunity to evaluate, in a set-
ting in which the highest-quality clinical and radiographic
assessments of knee OA were obtained, the relationship of
the history of leisure running with knee pain, radiographic
OA, and symptomatic OA in a broad range of people who
ran at some point in their lives and compare them to those
who never ran. Based on the existing literature, we hypothe-
sized that a history of leisure running may increase the risk
of knee symptoms and radiographic knee OA, even at lower
levels (for a breakdown of the existing literature, see Supple-
mentary Table 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research
web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.
22939/abstract).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study
design. This is a cross-sectional study nested
within the OAI, a prospective multicenter observational study
of knee OA including men and women ages 45 to 79 years old
at the time of enrollment (2004–2006) who had no evidence of
knee OA and were not deemed to be at high risk; or were at
high risk of developing symptomatic knee OA; or had preva-
lent symptomatic knee OA. The 4 clinical sites were Memorial
Hospital of Rhode Island (Pawtucket, RhodeIsland), Ohio State
University (Columbus, Ohio), the University of Pittsburgh
(Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), and the University of Maryland/
Johns Hopkins University (Baltimore, Maryland).
We studied OAI participants who completed a modified
version of the Historical Physical Activity Survey instrument
at the 96-month visit (the only time point at which this instru-
ment was used in this cohort) and who had knee-specific
pain data and/or knee radiographic readings at the 48-month
visit (the latest time point with the greatest number of
readings and data points available) or at a visit proximate to
that visit. Approval was obtained from the institutional
review board at each participating OAI site and at Baylor Col-
lege of Medicine. Each participant provided written informed
consent.
Historical Physical Activity Survey instrument. Between
September 12, 2012, and October 31, 2014, participants
were asked to complete a self-administered modified version
of the Historical Physical Activity Survey instrument (7),
prior to their OAI 96-month visit. At the time of the clinic
visit, if the survey was incomplete, participants were invited
to complete the survey with assistance from the clinic staff.
In the questionnaire, participants were asked to review 37
leisure-time physical activities, including “jogging or run-
ning (outdoor or indoor treadmill or track).” Then partici-
pants were asked to identify all activities they performed for
at least 20 minutes within a given day at least 10 times in
their lives during 4 age periods: 12–18, 19–34, 35–49, and
$50 years old. Then they identified the 3 most frequently
performed activities during those age periods. Additional
questions ascertained the number of years, months per year,
and bouts per month the participants engaged in those activ-
ities, in order to provide an estimate of bouts of an activity
per age period. Similar questions regarding walking as a
leisure-time activity were administered.
Individuals indicating running or jogging as a top-3 activ-
ity were defined as runners in those age periods. “Any his-
tory of running” included people who were runners in at
least one age period. We also asked people whether they par-
ticipated in the activity at a competitive level. To accommo-
date incorporation of this instrument within the OAI, the
instrument was given as a self-administered questionnaire, a
deviation from the original instrument, similar to what was
done by Chasan-Taber previously (8). Other modifications
were implemented to limit response burden, including the
use of ordinal categories for each of the frequency/duration
selections and limiting comments to the 3 activities most fre-
quently undertaken in each age period. Not included in the
original version was the question of whether they had parti-
cipated at a competitive level or not (dichotomous question),
and we included walking as an activity of interest for all age
ranges, which was also new.
Knee radiographs. Weight-bearing, bilateral, fixed-flexion,
posteroanterior radiographs of knees were obtained at the 48-

 month visit, the most current OAI visit with the largest num-
ber of radiographic readings at the time of this analysis. Cen-
tral readers (9) scored for overall radiographic severity using
Kellgren/Lawrence (K/L) grades (0–4) based on the Osteoar-
thritis Research Society International Atlas (10). If the 48-
month visit readings were not available, readings from the
most proximate radiographs available (at the baseline, 12-,
24-, or 36-month visit) were used instead. The reliability for
these readings (read-reread) was substantial (11) (weighted
kappa for intrarater reliability 0.71 [95% confidence interval
0.55–0.87]) (12).
Pain assessment. At the 48-month visit (contemporane-
ous with the radiographs described above), participants
were asked to self-report knee-specific pain: “During the last
12 months, have you had pain, aching, or stiffness in or
around your right/left knee on most days for at least one
month? By most days, we mean more than half the days of a
month.” If the 48-month visit responses were not available,
the responses from most proximate prior in-person visit
(baseline, 12-, 24-, or 36-month visit) were used instead.
Covariates. Date of birth and date of the 48-month visit
were used to calculate participant ages. Body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as weight divided by height squared
(kg/m2), measured at the 36-month OAI visit, the closest visit
to the 48-month visit where both height and weight were
measured. If the BMI was missing at the 36-month visit, the
BMI from the most proximate annual visit was used instead.

 were self-reported at baseline and at all annual visits up to
the 48-month visit. All publicly available data were accessed
from the OAI website (http://oai.epi-ucsf.org/datarelease/).
Statistical analysis. Using logistic regression, we evalu-
ated the association of any history of running as well as dur-
ing 4 age periods: ages 12–18, 19–34, 35–49, and $50 years
with the prevalence of radiographic OA, frequent knee pain,
and symptomatic OA. All outcome definitions were person-
based definitions. Radiographic OA was defined as a K/L
grade .2 in at least 1 knee. Frequent knee pain was defined
by answering affirmative to the knee pain question regarding
at least 1 knee. Symptomatic radiographic OA was defined
as having at least 1 knee with both radiographic OA and fre-
quent knee pain. Because we were interested in an assess-
ment of ever having had knee OA symptoms or radiographic
evidence of knee OA related to running exposure, those with
a history of TKR were classified as having all 3 outcomes.
If participants had 1 knee with the outcome of interest,
they were classified as having the outcome, even if data from
the contralateral knee were missing. If participants had 1
knee without the outcome of interest and the data for the
contralateral knee were missing, those participants were
excluded from the analyses. For each of the 4 age ranges and
any history of running, we looked at the exposure to running
in 2 ways: first, by dichotomizing those who were runners
versus nonrunners and, second, by examining 4 groups (non-
runners and low, medium, and high levels of runners based
on tertiles of running bouts).
We performed the analyses unadjusted and then adjusted
for age, sex, BMI, prior knee injury, and leisure-time physical
activities that were statistically significantly associated with
running (to account for activities correlated with running).
The leisure-time physical activity variables were binary vari-
ables if they occurred less frequently than in 33% of the
cohort; if they were more common than 33%, they were
included as tertiles of participation for the particular activity.
We tested whether there was an interaction between running
with injury and running with BMI. Participants missing the
Historical Physical Activity Survey were excluded from the
analyses.
To evaluate the differential effect of prior running and cur-
rent running on the outcomes of radiographic OA, knee
pain, and symptomatic OA, we categorized participants as
never runners, prior runners, and current runners and tested
this exposure with the 3 outcomes. Never runners were those
who did not identify running as a top-3 activity in any age
period. Prior runners were those who identified running as a
top-3 activity in at least 1 of the 3 younger periods but not
during the age .50 period. Current runners were those who
identified running as a top-3 activity during the age $50
period. A significant value for the Cochran-Armitage trend
test indicated a dose response. All analyses were performed
using SAS, version 9.4. P values less than 0.05 were consid-
ered statistically significant.
RESULTS
Of 4,796 OAI participants enrolled in the OAI database, 842
did not return for the 96-month visit (Figure 1). There were
699 participants whose visits preceded the window during
which the modified Historical Physical Activity Survey
instrument was administered and therefore did not complete
the survey. In total, of the 3,255 eligible to participate, 2,637
(80%) completed the modified Historic Physical Activity
Survey (Figure 1). Those who did not complete the lifetime
historical physical activity question tended to be older,
female, more likely to have radiographic OA and knee pain,
and more likely to have a history of TKR and injury. All but
one participant who completed the physical activity survey
had 48-month visit radiographs (99.9%; 2,636 of 2,637). The
remaining participant did not have radiographic readings
available from any visits. Frequent knee pain assessments
were available for 2,617 participants at the 48-month visit
(99.2%; 2,617 of 2,637). From the 36-month, 24-month, 12-
month, and baseline visits, 9, 1, 7, and 3 knee pain
assessments, respectively, were carried forward.

 In total, 2,637 participants were included. Of these, 55.8%
were female, the mean6 SD age was 64.36 8.9 years, and
the mean6 SD BMI was 28.56 4.9 kg/m2 (Table 1). Of the
2,637 participants, 634 were from the progression cohort
(had symptomatic OA at the baseline visit), 1,899 were from
the incidence cohort (did not have symptomatic OA at base-
line but were at high risk of developing symptomatic OA
during followup), and 104 were from the nonexposed con-
trol group (did not have symptomatic OA at baseline and
were not considered to be at high risk of developing symp-
tomatic OA during followup). There were 778 participants
(29.5%) who ran at some point in their lives; of those,
48.6%, 28.8%, 15.3%, and 7.3% identified running in 1, 2,
3, and 4 of the age ranges, respectively. Seventy-five percent
reported at least 250 bouts of running in their lives, 50% ran
at least 800 bouts, and 25% ran at least 2,000 bouts. Only a
very small percentage of overall participants in each time
frame indicated that they ran competitively (2–5%). From
the lowest to highest BMI tertile, 35.1%, 28.3%, and 25.0%
had any history of running.
Any history of running was associated with less frequent
knee pain (Table 2) in the unadjusted and adjusted models
compared to those who never ran. Those who had any history
of running had lower odds of both radiographic OA and
symptomatic OA compared to those who did not run (Table 3
and Table 4) in the unadjusted models, but these were no
longer significant in models adjusted for age, sex, BMI, all
leisure-time physical activities that significantly correlated
with running during the relevant time frame, and prior knee
injury. All 3 outcomes were least common in current runners
and most common in never runners, except in the fully
adjusted model evaluating radiographic OA (Table 5). There
was no interaction between running and either injury or BMI
for any of the 3 outcomes (data not shown).

Running and Knee OA
187
 DISCUSSION
Our findings show that a history of leisure-time running is
not associated with increased odds of prevalent knee pain,
radiographic OA, or symptomatic OA. In fact, for knee pain,
there was a dose-dependent inverse association with run-
ning, with runners having less knee pain. With no interac-
tion between running and history of injury or BMI, those
with and without knee injury or with higher or lower BMIs
did not have a differential association between running and
OA. This was an observational study where people chose
whether or not they wanted to run; therefore there is always
the possibility that people stopped running because they
had knee pain. Thus we cannot comment on the influence of
compulsory running on overall knee health. This cohort was
not recruited based on elite running status, making these
findings potentially more applicable to a broader population
than many prior studies (Supplementary Table 1). Frequent
knee pain and symptomatic OA were observed least com-
monly in current runners and most commonly in never
runners in all models, which suggests that running cessation
is not more harmful than never running at all. Running does
not appear to be detrimental from a knee health perspective.
The historical lifetime physical activity questionnaire
used in our study was substantially modified compared to
the original instrument designed by Kriska et al (7) that has
been validated and used to establish links between lifetime
physical activity and bone mineral density (7), decreased
risk of diabetes (13), and decreased risk of ovarian cancer
(14). Importantly, it was a self-administered questionnaire,
using a similar strategy as Chasan-Taber et al, which was
reproducible and showed that metabolic equivalent hours
per week were lowest in the earliest and oldest age periods

 (8), similar to the observed prevalence of running in our
study. The inverse association between BMI and running in
our study also lends it construct validity. Using this instru-
ment, we captured activities performed at least 10 times in
their lives that were listed as a top-3 activity in at least 1 of 4
age periods to be considered a runner. Arguably, running
only 10 times may not be sufficient to classify participants as
runners. However, in our study, among those who were
identified as runners, 75% reported running at least 250
bouts in their lives, 50% ran at least 800 bouts, and 25% ran
at least 2,000 bouts, supporting the idea that most runners
ran far more than 10 bouts and were classified correctly.
There may have also been some misclassification of runners
as nonrunners if people participated in many different
leisure-time physical activities and running just did not
make the top 3 activities. We addressed this possibility by
adjusting for all activities that were correlated with running;
notably, this adjustment did not alter any results.
A limitation to our study is that the exposure of interest,
running, has been retrospectively ascertained. Since we
were interested in the exposure to running over a long dura-
tion of time, prospective assessment of this exposure would
have been much more expensive and cumbersome than
the retrospective ascertainment deployed in this study.
Although the assessment of running status may have been
influenced by recall bias, since it has not been clear whether
running is harmful or protective against knee OA, it is
unlikely that the recall bias would be differential in either
direction. Notably, our response rate was high, at 81%, but
without knowing the distribution of runners among those
who did not provide us with data on physical activity, it is
difficult to know how inclusion of all nonparticipants would

 have impacted the results of our study. Also, although the
questionnaire was not administered to all of the participants,
approximately half of each of the progression and incidence
cohorts responded, and nearly all of the nonexposed controls
responded. This is a sample enriched with people who had
radiographic OA and symptoms at the time of enrollment.
For this reason, it is likely that the prevalence of OA could
be overestimated compared to the general population. Also,
it may be that the prevalence of running in the general popu-
lation may be different than what is seen in this group.
In our study we defined our outcomes using 48-month
visit measures because this is the time point at which the
OAI funded the greatest number of radiographs to be read to
date. Consequently, the modified Historical Physical Activ-
ity Survey instrument, used to define runner status and
administered at the 96-month visit, was administered at a
time point after which all outcomes were assessed. However,
since the survey required recall over a long period of time
and the results were similar during most age groups of run-
ning, this limitation did not likely impact the validity of our
results.
The directionality of associations in regard to causation
observed in cross-sectional studies generally should not be
commented upon; however, in the instance of our study, it is
unlikely that a diagnosis of OA or symptoms of it caused
people to start running. The hypothesized direction of influ-
ence was that running would have an effect on OA. It is
important to note that because of the cross-sectional nature
of this study, we cannot comment on the influence of run-
ning in those with preexisting knee OA, as in this study we
are only evaluating one point in time. The assumption in our
study is that prevalence reflects incident symptoms and dis-
ease. The findings from this study support the need for larger
longitudinal studies that evaluate the exposure to running,
even at lower levels, and its effects on incident and progres-
sive knee OA.
Prior studies (Supplementary Table 1) evaluating the rela-
tionship between running and knee OA have mostly focused
on those performing at elite or high levels of running (e.g.,
elite runners [15–18] or members of a running club [19–22]).
These studies have been important from the perspective that
they have evaluated a high level of the exposure as a risk fac-
tor for knee OA. By studying high levels of running, most
of these athletes likely limited the type of exercise to run-
ning, allowing for a more homogenous group of people who
run. A limitation to these studies, however, is that their
results are not generalizable to most adults who run less.
Those who run less may respond differently to running than
the elite athlete. For instance, they may be less skilled at run-
ning since they run less and therefore they may incur differ-
ent biomechanical stresses compared to those who run
more. Alternatively, it could have been that elite runners
expose their knees to excessive amounts of loading second-
ary to their high levels of running, which could potentially
be harmful to the knee, whereas a lower amount of running
conversely may not be harmful. Our study findings add to
the existing literature by including a large sample in which
we were able to assess the influence of running in people
who participated in it for shorter amounts of time and perhaps
stopped doing it and to evaluate them with high-quality
assessments of symptoms and standardized radiographs. We
found that runners in this group were not at a higher risk for
symptomatic knee OA.
A high level of loading occurs within the knee during run-
ning (23), and runners are prone to knee injury, with injuries
in 7–50% of runners, depending on the study (24), which is
similar to the rate we observed in our study (Table 1). Intui-
tively, because of these attributes, it might be expected that
runners would be at higher risk for knee OA. Instead, in our
study, we did not find an increased risk for knee OA. Per-
haps the lower BMI seen in runners compared to nonrunners
(2), which was also seen in our study, balances the effects of

 running on knee OA. The exact reasons why a higher BMI is
a risk factor for knee OA are not entirely clear, but the associ-
ation of higher BMI with incident knee OA is a consistent
finding in epidemiologic studies (25). Running could lead to
a healthier lifestyle, or since running is a strenuous exercise
that requires repeated flexion and extension of the knee, it
could improve proprioception and periarticular muscle
strength that may also reduce the risk of knee OA. Irrespec-
tive of the biologic pathway, the overall influence of running
on knee OA, when taking all the evidence into consider-
ation, does not appear to be harmful. In conclusion, running
does not appear detrimental for knee health. People with the
lowest BMIs were most likely to identify running as an activ-
ity they participated in at some point in their lives. Although
we cannot comment on the influence of running in those
with preexisting knee OA, among those without OA, run-
ning should not be discouraged because of concern of an
increased risk for developing knee OA or associated frequent
knee pain.
