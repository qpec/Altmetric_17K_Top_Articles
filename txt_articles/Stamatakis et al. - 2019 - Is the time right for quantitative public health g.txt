AbsTRACT
Sedentary behaviour (SB) has been proposed as an 
’independent’ risk factor for chronic disease risk, 
attracting much research and media attention. Many 
countries have included generic, non-quantitative 
reductions in SB in their public health guidelines and 
calls for quantitative SB targets are increasing. The aim of 
this narrative review is to critically evaluate key evidence 
areas relating to the development of guidance on sitting 
for adults. We carried out a non-systematic narrative 
evidence synthesis across seven key areas: (1) definition 
of SB, (2) independence of sitting from physical activity, 
(3) use of television viewing as a proxy of sitting, (4) 
interpretation of SB evidence, (5) evidence on ’sedentary 
breaks’, (6) evidence on objectively measured sedentary 
SB and mortality and (7) dose response of sitting and 
mortality/cardiovascular disease. Despite research 
progress, we still know little about the independent 
detrimental health effects of sitting, and the possibility 
that sitting is mostly the inverse of physical activity 
remains. Unresolved issues include an unclear definition, 
inconsistencies between mechanistic and epidemiological 
studies, over-reliance on surrogate outcomes, a very 
weak epidemiological evidence base to support the 
inclusion of ’sedentary breaks’ in guidelines, reliance on 
self-reported sitting measures, and misinterpretation of 
data whereby methodologically inconsistent associations 
are claimed to be strong evidence. In conclusion, public 
health guidance requires a consistent evidence base but 
this is lacking for SB. The development of quantitative 
SB guidance, using an underdeveloped evidence base, is 
premature; any further recommendations for sedentary 
behaviour require development of the evidence base and 
refinement of the research paradigms used in the field.
InTRoduCTIon 
In the last decade, we have witnessed an exponen-
tial growth in research concerned with the study 
of ‘sedentary behaviour’ (SB) and its potential for 
detrimental effects on health. The origins of the 
field of SB as distinct from physical activity (PA) 
can be traced back to two high-profile publica-
tions at the turn of the century1 2 that coined the 
term ‘non-exercise activity thermogenesis’ (NEAT), 
a term describing incidental movement and 
non-structured low-intensity PA such as fidgeting, 
standing, ambulating and incidental walking of light 
intensity. The NEAT proposition was that as struc-
tured exercise makes up a very small proportion of 
daily PA energy expenditure, obesity can be tackled 
by energy expenditure increases through incidental 
movement, fidgeting and less sitting. Some of the 
first epidemiological studies in the field examined 
the associations between TV viewing (as a marker 
of SB) and cardiometabolic outcomes and appeared 
at around the same time.3–5 Among the first SB 
studies to examine different domains of sitting with 
prospective cardiometabolic outcomes was an anal-
ysis of the Nurses’ Health Study data.6 A thoughtful 
review by Hamilton and colleagues in 20077 gave 
momentum to SB by proposing a public health 
context and an animal model-based biological 
mechanism. A large body of research examining the 
hypothesised links between sitting (or indicators of 
it) and health outcomes,8 9 interventions to reduce 
SB10 and SB correlates11 has been generated since. 
Essentially, the key message has been that the health 
detriments of sitting are independent of moderate 
to vigorous physical activity (MVPA); the latter, 
MVPA, has been the primary focus of the public 
health guidelines in the previous three decades.12 13 
There were calls to introduce public health guide-
lines on sitting as early as 2008.14 The response to 
the accumulated research in this area has been the 
inclusion of SB-related messages in several national 
PA guidelines aimed at adults and children, including 
UK,12 
Australia,15 
New 
Zealand,16 
Canada,17 
Germany,18 Norway19 (see table 1) and in statements 
of eminent scientific authorities.20 A set of quantita-
tive workplace-specific SB guidelines21 recommended 
reducing work time sitting by up to 4 
hours per day. 
This guideline, however, was not evidence based and 
it has been criticised for possible sit–stand desk and 
related industry interference and undeclared conflicts 
of interest.22 Calls for developing population-wide 
quantitative sitting guidance continue apace and are 
often based on cross-sectional findings. The aim of this 
review is to evaluate key aspects of the SB evidence 
relating to cardiometabolic health and mortality and 
to discuss the timeliness of developing specific guide-
lines on sitting.
definition of sb: is it not all about sitting?
The ubiquitous behaviour that is considered a health 
threat is sitting. There are two modern definitions 
of SB. The first of these definitions is purely physio-
logical and is synonymous with the lower end of the 
energy expenditure continuum <1.5 
metabolic equiv-
alents (MET
s)23 which, strictly speaking, also includes 
standing quietly (1.2 MET).24 The second definition 
has physiological (<1.5 MET
s) as well as postural (in 
a sitting or reclining posture) and contextual (waking 
times) components.25 26 As previously noted,27 the

Review
tabled MET values for some common types of sitting range from 
1 to 2 MET28 and therefore do not strictly conform with either of 
these definitions. For example, sitting while fidgeting and sitting in 
the classroom are both assigned 1.8 MET; driving a car is assigned 
2.5 MET. Yet, the health impact of both time spent driving29 and 
classroom time30 is examined as SB. This lack of consistency on 
the definition of SB is of concern as it makes the relevant evidence 
prone to misinterpretations, as shown in figure 1 and discussed in 
the subsequent sections. Recent efforts to further refine the defi-
nition of SB26 by introducing terms such as ‘stationary behaviour’ 
(lack of ambulatory movement in any posture), for example, may 
help resolve some of the issues described in the following sections.
Is sitting an ‘independent’ risk factor?
Perhaps the most powerful driving force for the SB field is 
the idea that the harms caused by too much sitting cannot be 
countered by doing sufficient PA, an idea that has been promul-
gated by both mass media and segments of the research commu-
nity. For example, a recent media analysis study31 found that 
almost 40% of SB-related stories in Australian newspapers stated 
that PA is irrelevant if a person sits for too long or that the bene-
fits of PA are abolished by too much sitting. Despite the lack 
of any compelling evidence to support it, this idea was dissemi-
nated from the early days of SB research and is a view that is still 
in circulation.20 32
From the epidemiological evidence, it is becoming clear that 
the associations of sitting time with all-cause mortality (ACM) 
or cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality are often seen to be 
dependent on MVPA levels.33–36 A recent large study involved 
a pooled individual participant meta-analysis of self-reported 
sitting studies published as part of the 2016 Lancet Series on 
Physical Activity (n=1 005 791 for ACM; n=849

Review
CVD mortality analyses).37 Self-reported sitting time was 
categorised as <4, 4, <6, 6–8, >8 
hours/day and the quar-
tiles of PA had medians corresponding to roughly ≤5, 25–35, 
50–65 and ≥60–75 
minutes/day of moderate intensity activity. 
Compared with those in the lowest sitting and highest PA group, 
a dose–response association between sitting time and CVD death 
was noted in least physically active group with HR increasing 
from 1.34 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.43) in the bottom to 1.74 (95% 
CI 1.60 to 1.90) in the top sitting groups. Associations with 
CVD mortality in the second and third PA quartiles were less 
dose dependent, less stable and of lower magnitude. There was 
no evidence for an association between sitting time and CVD 
mortality risk in the top PA quartile and results for cancer and 
ACM pointed in the same direction.37 These data do not support 
the almost concurrently published 2016 Science Advisory from 
the American Heart Association20 that concluded ‘it is likely that 
SB influences risk in part through some distinct mechanisms that 
act independent of MVPA’.
More examples of the perpetuation of the idea of ‘indepen-
dence from MVPA’ include a recent dose–response meta-anal-
ysis that also concluded that sitting was associated with greater 
risk for several major long-term outcomes ‘independent of PA’.32 
Such a conclusion indicates the need for a tighter definition of 
‘independent associations’. Studies included in this review32 
assessed independence by merely treating MVPA as a potential 
confounder. Although this approach cannot be discarded,27 32 it 
is insufficient for understanding independent health effects of 
sitting on its own as it ignores the evidence of effect modifica-
tion.33–37 Figure 2 shows a conceptual diagram of how the asso-
ciations of SB with long-term health outcomes may be dependent 
on PA.
Other grounds to challenge the idea of ‘independent asso-
ciations’ is the absence of a convincing biological mechanism 
through which too much sitting harms health irrespective of 
PA levels. The first and perhaps still most popular proposed 
mechanism was an animal model,7 which suggested that 
prolonged sitting impairs lipoprotein lipase activity and this 
could be prevented by changing posture to standing, with no 
further benefit from exercise. But this framework was originally 
published 15 years ago38 and despite not having been confirmed 
in humans in it is still cited as a plausible mechanism.32 More 
recently, prolonged sitting has been implicated in endothelial cell 
dysfunction caused by reduction in leg blood flow-induced shear 
stress.39 This is a coherent mechanistic framework but it does 
not support independent effects of sitting as it acknowledges 
that endothelial dysfunction is prevented if sitting is preceded 
by an exercise bout.39 Several other attempts40 41 to identify and 
develop models for independent mechanisms of the effects of SB 
on cardiovascular outcomes are also not well developed; thus, 
the likelihood that SB is mostly the inverse of too little PA is still 
plausible.
From the public health point of view, the independent associa-
tion of SB with long-term outcomes, if any, can be used to calcu-
late the theoretical amounts of sitting reductions required to 
achieve population-wide risk reduction equivalent to meeting the 
basic MVPA guideline (20%–33% 
reduction in ACM and CVD 
mortality risk42 and 13% reduction in type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) risk43). Even if independence from PA is assumed, the 
reported per-hour 4% increase in ACM and CVD mortality risk 
among high sitters32 and the linear 1% increase in T2DM risk32 
suggest that the sitting reductions required to achieve MVPA 
guideline equivalent risk reduction is in the order of 5–13 
hours/
day. Considering that the average daily reductions achieved by 
recreational and workplace SB interventions is substantially 
lower (0.5 
hours44 and 1.2 
hours45), both the clinical and public 
health impact of the above meta-analytical estimates32 are likely 
extraneous.
Evidence on TV time as a marker of sb: health risks of sitting 
or a cluster of confounding?
Much of the early4 5 46 and current47 SB research was concerned 
with the study of television viewing (TV).48 49 At face value, such 
a focus is justified because screen media is a major discretionary 
component of total SB, with national studies showing that as of 
2012 adults in, for example, England spent 2.8–3.1 
hours/day 
watching TV
.50 However, the literature on TV viewing and health 
tell us little about sitting. First, studies in adults have established 
that TV time is poorly correlated to sitting time. The largest 
(n=5738) such study to date examined the correlation of the 
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 
TV time questions51 with waist accelerometry-estimated SB but 
found weak (rho=0.14) or no (rho=0.03) correlations for adults 
in part-time or full-time employment, respectively. Similar find-
ings have been reported in other large studies that used waist-
worn51 52 or thigh-worn accelerometers,53 with coefficients 
ranging from 0.05 to 0.17.
Besides not reflecting sitting time, TV time is confounded by 
factors that are strong determinants of poor health outcomes 
but are not always accounted for, such as dietary intake and 
TV time snacking,54 socioeconomic status (SES)55 56 and mental 
health.57 The role of socioeconomic confounding is particularly 
important. Although higher SES has been linked to higher total 
sedentary time and occupational sitting time,55 high TV time 
has been invariably linked to low SES.56 The more aspects of 
SES are considered (eg, education, occupational class, income), 
the steeper the socioeconomic gradient of TV time becomes.56 
Aspects of TV behaviour, such as programme content or the expo-
sure to negative messages that may act as chronic psychological 
cardiovascular stressors58 have hardly been acknowledged in the 
SB literature and are universal residual confounders. Besides, TV 
evidence becomes less relevant as the recreational screen media 
landscape is rapidly changing with TV viewing gradually being 
replaced by small screens such as smartphones and tablets. With 
all this and other supporting evidence59 in mind, it is unlikely 
that TV viewing evidence reflects health harms of sitting. The 
inclusion of such evidence to draw public health guidance on 
sitting has therefore been problematic.

Review
Interpretation of ‘sb’ studies: ‘Chinese whispers’?
Among studies that reported associations of multiple markers 
of SB with longitudinal outcomes, TV time invariably shows the 
most consistent associations.60 61 While this may partly reflect 
that TV can be recalled more accurately, the literature cited in the 
previous section indicate that there is little support for the idea 
that health risks associated with TV viewing9 62 63 can be attributed 
to sitting. There are several evidence interpretation implications 
that follow. First, the approach taken by some otherwise high-
quality reviews that meta-analyse TV studies together with total 
sitting studies9 62 is questionable. Such practices unavoidably 
lead to misleading interpretations about sitting. For example, 
a meta-analysis of 10 cross-sectional and prospective studies 
concluded that among all health outcomes, the strongest associa-
tions were observed for T2DM, where the highest category of SB 
time was linked to 112% higher risk for T2DM (95% 
CI 61% to 
178%) compared with the lowest category.62 Another review of 
prospective studies,9 meta-analysed five of the above studies and 
also concluded that among all outcomes, the largest effect sizes 
were again observed for risk for T2DM (>90% 
increase in risk, 
64%–122%). Based on these findings,9 62 diabetes is frequently 
highlighted as the outcome most closely linked with SB.63 All but 
one of the original studies in these meta-analyses used TV time 
as the exposure.3 6 64 65 There are further methodological issues 
that make such evidence less convincing. For example, the indi-
vidual studies effect sizes entered in the meta-analysis were often 
derived using extreme comparisons, for example, ≥7 
hour/day 
versus <1 
hour/day66 or ≥40 
hour/week versus <1 
hour/week.3 
PA was not always taken into account62 and estimates were not 
adjusted for body mass index on the grounds of adiposity being 
on the causal pathway between SB and the T2DM.62 But this is 
only an assumption as little evidence supports the notion that 
sedentary behaviour is associated with subsequent obesity.67 To 
the contrary, a number of prospective studies68–70 suggest that 
adiposity determines future SB (and hence adiposity precedes SB 
on the causal pathway).
More recent prospective studies on total sitting time and inci-
dent T2DM found no association,71 72 or associations limited to 
inactive36 73 or obese36 participants only. This newer evidence 
suggests that the conclusions of the above reviews9 62 may be 
potentially misleading if they are interpreted in the context of 
sitting. The extrapolation of TV time exposure literature findings 
to draw conclusions on the health risks of ‘sedentary behaviour’ 
and further translation of this evidence into messages on the 
health risks of sitting is, unfortunately, common in SB research 
(figure 1). This inaccurate information transmitted across 
sequential communications is of concern because evidence from 
such studies represents a sizeable part of the overall evidence 
base that has supported the inclusion of SB in public health guid-
ance around the world.12 15 16
How evidence based are the recommendations for breaking 
sedentary time?
One widely discussed concept in SB is that of ‘sedentary breaks’, 
referring to interruptions of prolonged sitting. Different varia-
tions of such interruptions are included in the guidance of several 
countries12 15 16 18 19 and in the case of the New Zealand guide-
lines,16 ‘sit less, breaking sedentary time’ appears before the PA 
recommendation. Sedentary breaks have been proposed to confer 
cardiovascular and metabolic benefits even when total sitting 
time is held constant74 but the evidence supporting their health 
effects is often inconsistent and limited to small-scale trials in 
selected samples. Even cross-sectional studies present an unclear 
picture, including the largest published cross-sectional study of 
thigh-worn inclinometers that found little evidence for associa-
tions of sitting with glucose metabolism among 2497 adults.75 
In the study that first introduced the concept, the number of SB 
breaks of 170 adults was inversely associated with triglycerides 
and to a lesser extent with adiposity surrogate markers and 
2 
hour plasma glucose, while there were no associations with 
blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol.74 A subsequent larger cross-sectional study among 4757 
NHANES participants76 found inverse associations of breaks 
with waist circumference, C-reactive protein, HDL cholesterol 
(women only), but no associations with the remaining five exam-
ined cardiometabolic risk factors. In cross-sectional studies, the 
most consistently associated outcomes with sedentary breaks are 
adiposity related,77 but these may be prone to reverse causation, 
that is, obese people sit continuously for longer periods of time. 
Despite this mixed and rather weak evidence, such cross-sec-
tional studies74 76 have been broadly cited as support for the links 
between sedentary breaks and cardiometabolic health.
To date, very few large-scale prospective studies assessed the 
links between sedentary breaks and cardiometabolic outcomes 
and, to our knowledge, none of them fully supports links 
between frequency of interrupting sitting posture and prospec-
tive outcomes. For example, baseline sedentary breaks did 
not predict any of five cardiometabolic variables at 6-month 
follow-up in a study of 582 
patients with T2DM78 and were not 
associated with ACM over 5 years of follow-up in a recent study 
of 1655 older British men.79 To our knowledge, there is only one 
prospective epidemiological study that provides some support 
to the sedentary breaks hypothesis, the REasons for Geographic 
And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study of 7985 
US adults where longer SB bouts (directly related to infrequent 
sedentary breaks) were associated with increased ACM risk over 
4 years.80 However, this, like both other prospective studies 
above,78 79 used waist-worn accelerometers and their findings 
may also reflect interruptions of standing with ambulatory 
movement (highlighting the benefits of frequent PA), rather than 
interruptions of sitting with bouts of standing or light ambu-
lation (which is what the sedentary breaks hypothesis postu-
lates). Despite the scarce prospective epidemiological evidence, 
it is encouraging that some national guidelines18 19 specifically 
recommend interrupting sitting with physical activity (table 1).
Beyond these uncertainties and the limited support epide-
miological evidence offers to the sedentary breaks hypothesis, 
several laboratory-based trials have consistently shown beneficial 
effects of interrupting continuous sitting with light PA on post-
prandial glucose metabolism.77 81–84 Such studies have demon-
strated effects of frequent interruptions of continued sitting (eg, 
2–3 
min of light intensity activity every 20–30 
min over several 
hours) on postprandial glucose and insulin, and to a lesser extent 
on classical cardiovascular biomarkers such as triglycerides and 
cholesterol.77 While such studies provide important mechanistic 
insights, there are several issues that complicate their translation 
into sitting-specific population guidance. First, it is unclear if the 
cardiometabolic benefits of sedentary breaks are due to (1) higher 
energy expended during the light intensity activity bouts, (2) the 
muscular contraction occurring during the transition from sitting 
to standing (and vice versa) or (3) by the change in posture (which 
is what the sedentary breaks hypothesis mostly postulates). The 
finding that standing breaks appear to have an effect among 
metabolically compromised (eg, dysglycaemic or patients with 
T2DM85 but not healthy adults support interpretation (1) or (2): 
even subtle muscular contraction during the sitting to standing 
transition generates measurable improvements among those

Review
with impaired (elevated) levels of metabolic markers. Second, 
there is currently no indication that such acute and relatively 
subtle beneficial responses to interrupting sitting translate into 
improved long term outcomes. This is an important aspect of 
the interpretation of these small laboratory-based studies given 
that the link between surrogate T2DM outcomes and long term 
cardiovascular implications is not always clear.86 87 For example, 
evidence from pharmacological trials suggests that even inten-
sive glycaemic control often does not translate into better CVD 
mortality and morbidity outcomes.86 88 In the absence of any 
degree of congruence between mechanistic and prospective 
evidence, the use of such laboratory-based evidence to develop 
conclusive public health guidance is inappropriate. The inclusion 
of sedentary breaks in the evidence-based guidance in at least 
three countries15 16 18 in the last 5 years, based on such limited 
evidence, calls for a reassessment of the evidence standards in 
the field. Such assertions are congruent with the most authorita-
tive evidence review to date, the 2018 Physical Activity Guide-
lines Advisory Committee Scientific Report, which flagged the 
insufficient evidence in sedentary breaks across all examined 
health outcomes.89
studies of objectively measured sb and mortality: can they 
support sitting guidelines?
A number of predominately US-based studies have examined 
the association of objectively assessed SB and mortality. Most 
of these studies used the NHANES data set.60 90 91 Replacing 
1 
hour of sedentary time with equivalent amounts of light inten-
sity activity was associated with a 55% decrease in ACM risk. 
Schmid et al used both isotemporal substitution and non-sub-
stitution methodology and also reported large effect sizes in 
3702 NHANES participants, equivalent to 24%–28% 
reduc-
tion in ACM risk for each hour/day of sedentary time replaced 
with light intensity activity.92 In the same study,92 however, the 
non-isotemporal analyses found that SB was unrelated to the 
risk for CVD death regardless of whether other PA was taken 
into account or not and that SB was associated with ACM only 
among physically inactive individuals.92 Evenson et al60 anal-
ysed the association of accelerometry-measured SB, LPA, MPA 
and MVPA with ACM and CVD mortality in 3809 NHANES 
participants.92 Once other PA was taken into account neither SB 
nor light intensity activity were associated with ACM or CVD 
mortality,60 and these observations were in agreement with a 
recent, large accelerometry mortality study from the Women’s 
Health Study cohort.93 By contrast, the REGARDS study found 
that total SB time was associated with higher ACM risk in 7985 
US adults.80 However, it is unclear if these associations were 
independent of PA as in the stratum of the 1750 participants 
that met the MPVA guidelines there were only 29 events across 
four SB groups and estimates were unstable (trend p=0.090).80
The above body of evidence offers little support for guidelines 
on sitting. First, results from mortality studies are relatively mixed, 
even when analysed within the same NHANES data set.60 90 91 
Most importantly, no published study with mortality or inci-
dent disease endpoints, to our knowledge, examined sitting (as 
a posture). All studies summarised above used waist-worn accel-
erometers that do not completely distinguish between standing 
and sitting; their output that is commonly labelled ‘sedentary 
behaviour’ is actually lack of ambulatory movement (accelera-
tion). Even if such studies that generally supported a deleterious 
association between SB and mortality were to be considered in 
isolation, the public health message they would clearly support is 
‘move more (at any intensity)/do not stay still’, not ‘sit less’. Such 
confusion could be resolved in the future if the recently intro-
duced term ‘stationary behaviour’26 is used in a standardised 
manner and interpreted in terms of benefits of ambulatory 
movement, not the harms of sitting.
Are we close to understanding the threshold of daily sitting 
that is harmful?
It is well established that the association of daily sitting time and 
most long-term outcomes is not linear. Dose–response evidence 
on mostly self-reported sitting time in adults suggests that CVD 
risk is elevated at approximately 632–1094 
hours/day, while the 
corresponding threshold for ACM appears to be approximately 
8 
hours/day.32 95 But how confident can one be that the above 
self-reported daily thresholds are close to the true population 
values of sitting? Comparative international studies consistently 
report median self-reported durations in the region of 5 
hours/
day.96 97 On the other hand, national surveillance studies that 
used waist-worn accelerometers61 98 and smaller studies that used 
inclinometers53 75 reported estimates in the region of 8–9.5 
hours/
day of SB and sitting, respectively. Taken together, it appears 
that self-reports may underestimate sedentary time by a relative 
large margin when compared with objective methods. Although 
it is difficult to estimate the exact degree of measurement error 
from self-reported sitting time, the above data suggest this could 
be as high as a 40%–60%. This may have implications for the 
thresholds identified in the above meta-analyses.32 95 Theoreti-
cally, if assuming a similar proportion of reporting errors from 
previous epidemiological studies, the daily thresholds94 95 for an 
association between self-reported sitting and health outcomes 
at the population level may be as high as 11–13 (ACM) and 
14–16 
hours/day (CVD). Although the above extrapolations are 
too crude to form the basis of guidelines, such high amounts 
of daily sitting may reflect underlying poor health more than a 
sedentary lifestyle. In the absence of long-term prospective epide-
miological evidence from studies that used objective measures of 
actual sitting (as opposed to absence of ambulatory movement), 
any quantitative daily sitting guideline may be misleading.
Timeliness of developing quantitative sitting guidance: an 
evidence base at the crossroads
In its current state, the SB evidence base is insufficiently devel-
oped to inform quantitative public health guidance. Some of this 
uncertainty is due to misleading media reporting and researcher 
enthusiasm, which portrayed SB evidence as nearly conclusive. 
The limitations of sitting measurement outlined above is another 
major issue. While waist worn accelerometers were undoubtedly 
a major step forward and are useful for understanding the health 
risks associated with the lack of ambulatory movement, they tell 
us little about the health risks of actual sitting. Questionnaires 
are useful and feasible for large-scale observational research and 
surveillance but they may be prone to systematic reporting bias. 
Quantitative data from these instruments should be interpreted 
cautiously and it seems premature to develop quantitative sitting 
guidelines based on self-reported data only, considering the 
major advances in the application of objective measures of sitting 
in ongoing epidemiological studies. Technology that uses thigh-
worn sensors or combinations of placements (eg, thigh and hip or 
back) are more promising for quantifying actual sitting time. To 
our knowledge, there is no published prospective SB study using 
such methods. Although the use of such tools in large population 
studies has been relatively limited in the past, for the first time it 
seems feasible. Examples include the Maastricht Study76 and the 
1970 British Birth Cohort99 that are currently using thigh-worn

sensors in estimated samples of appoximately 8000 and 6000–
6500 adults, respectively; and the HUNT cohort in Norway100 
which is currently using two sensors (thigh-worn and lower 
back) in an estimated sample of 40 
000–50 000 adults. These 
and several other studies that use similar methods can be linked 
to mortality and incident morbidity records. Thus, it is likely 
that these studies, in the near future (perhaps within 5–6 years), 
will produce evidence on the prospective associations of actual 
sitting time, sedentary breaks and accumulation patterns with 
mortality and incident morbidity. Further, emergent analytical 
approaches that may overcome issues such as collinearity and 
better handle multibehaviour 24 
hours data (eg, compositional 
data analysis101 and isotemporal substitution102) are increasingly 
used. These statistical approaches have some clear advantages 
in that they acknowledge the interdependence of times spent 
in different components of the 24 
hours continuum (sitting, 
standing, light activity, moderate to vigorous activity and sleep). 
But when it comes to generating evidence that will inform public 
health guidance they also have their own challenges, such as is 
the lack of clarity on how to translate ‘budgets’ consisting three 
or four components of the 24 
PA continuum into simple public 
health messages. Despite these uncertainties (that will hope-
fully be resolved as the field evolves), the collective capacity 
of all these developments, including recent advances in activity 
pattern recognition,103 may change what we know about the 
health effects of bodily movement (or lack of it) within the next 
half decade. Developing credible prospective epidemiological 
evidence on the independent long-term health effects of sitting 
with long-term health outcomes is one of the most important 
links in the public health evidence guidance chain. This link is 
currently missing.
ConClusIon
Calls to introduce specific guidelines on SB were initiated when 
the state of the evidence was, at best, preliminary and they 
continue to appear with increased frequency. A glimpse of a 
‘breakthrough’ in science often generates overt enthusiasm, 
especially when amplified by sensationalised headlines in the 
popular media.31 Because the evidence base is incomplete, 
rushing to develop quantitative guidelines on sitting is poten-
tially harmful for public health since once established, they are 
difficult to modify without confusing both health professionals 
and the public alike. Public health messages about encouraging 
movement of any intensity may be simpler, easier to communi-
cate to the public and are supported by a continuously expanding 
literature.79 89 104
Refinement of the research paradigms used in the sedentary 
behaviour field is the first step towards advancing our under-
standing of the independent health effects of too much sitting.

Key messages
 
► The study of sedentary behaviour (usually, but not always, 
synonymous to ‘sitting too much’) as a health risk has 
received considerable research attention.
 
► Non-quantitative public sitting guidelines have been included 
in public health guidance in several countries and usually 
consist of messages to sit less and break prolonged sitting 
times.
 
► We still know relatively little about the independent 
detrimental health effects of sitting, and there are many 
inconsistencies in how the evidence based was developed 
and interpreted.
 
► Key issues include an unclear definition, inconsistency 
between mechanistic and epidemiological evidence, over-
reliance on surrogate outcomes and weak epidemiological 
evidence to even support the existing non-quantitative 
‘sedentary breaks’ component of guidelines.
 
► The sedentary behaviour evidence base is underdeveloped 
and inconsistent; it cannot support quantitative guidance.
 
► Prioritising a message such as ‘move more at any intensity’ 
while further research gives and robust and consistent 
answers about sedentary behaviour may be the most prudent 
course of action.
