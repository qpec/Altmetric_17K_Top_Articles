Abstract
Inherent intermediate- to low-affinity T-cell receptors (TCR)
that develop during the natural course of immune responses may
not allow sufficient activation for tumor elimination, making the
majority of T cells suboptimal for adoptive T-cell therapy (ATT).
TCR affinity enhancement has been implemented to provide
stronger T-cell activity but carries the risk of creating undesired
cross-reactivity leading to potential serious adverse effects in
clinical application. We demonstrate here that engineering of
low-avidity T cells recognizing a naturally processed and pre-
sented tumor-associated antigen with a chimeric PD-1:28 receptor
increases effector function to levels seen with high-avidity T cells
of identical specificity. Upgrading the function of low-avidity T
cells without changing the TCR affinity will allow a large arsenal of
low-avidity T cells previously thought to be therapeutically inef-
ficient to be considered for ATT. PD-1:28 engineering reinstated
Th1 function in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes that had been
functionally disabled in the human renal cell carcinoma envi-
ronment without unleashing undesired Th2 cytokines or IL10.
Involved mechanisms may be correlated to restoration of ERK and
AKT signaling pathways. In mouse tumor models of ATT, PD-1:28
engineering enabled low-avidity T cells to proliferate stronger and
prevented PD-L1 upregulation and Th2 polarization in the tumor
milieu. Engineered T cells combined with checkpoint blockade
secreted significantly more IFNg compared with T cells without
PD-1:28, suggesting a beneficial combination with checkpoint
blockade therapy or other therapeutic strategies. Altogether, the
supportive effects of PD-1:28 engineering on T-cell function make
it an attractive tool for ATT. Cancer Res; 77(13); 3577–90. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Magnitude, quality, and functional polarization of an immune
response are crucial for the control of many diseases, including
cancer. Examples of successful implementation of these principles
are the adoptive transfer of selected highly tumor-reactive T cells
(1) and checkpoint inhibition (2), which achieve remarkable
tumor regressions even in patients who have failed previous
treatments. Despite these successes, immunotherapeutic concepts
need to be improved as no or low response is still a frequent
outcome. Although there is consensus that durable antitumor
responses require highly activeT cells, it isnot clear how thisis best
achieved. At least two major impediments have been identified
that impinge upon achieving this prerequisite: inherent interme-
diate- to low-affinity T-cell receptors (TCR) of antitumor T cells
that may not mount a successful tumor-specific response (3, 4),
and functional inactivation of T cells in the tumor milieu (5–8).
Experimentally generated high-affinity TCRs might be advan-
tageous by boosting effector function and proliferation, thereby
persisting longer and in larger numbers as compared with T cells
with low-affinity TCRs, but they may also bear an increased risk of
unwanted toxicities (3, 4, 9–12). Low-avidity T cells would gain
value if their effector functions could be enhanced, as they are
reported to be less susceptible to tolerization and may represent a
lower toxicity risk (3, 4, 13, 14).
Loss of function following tumor infiltration occurs indepen-
dently of T-cell avidity (5–8). Thus, preventing or delaying func-
tional loss and endowing reactive T cells with the capacity to
maintain antitumor effector functions longer in the tumor envi-
ronment are imperatives for achieving more effective T-cell
response. Functional inactivation may occur due to blockade of

 TCR signaling, loss of cytotoxic proteins, lack of persistence, and
functional polarization from an antitumor Th1 to a less favorable
Th2 phenotype (15–21).
To overcome these activation restrictions, we focused on costi-
mulation and coinhibition signals controlling strength and dura-
tion of the T-cell response (22). In challenging environments,
costimulation has been shown to improve effector function as it
enables refill of lytic granules and T-cell expansion (23, 24). Thus,
we generated chimeric receptors composed of the PD-1 extracel-
lular domain and the CD28 signaling domain (PD-1:28) follow-
ing published designs (25, 26). PD-1:28–engineered T cells
should receive costimulatory signals to support survival, prolif-
eration, and TCR signaling when interacting with PD-1 ligand
(PD-L1) on tumor cells. Simultaneously, coinhibitory interaction
with expressed native PD-1 should be opposed, ameliorating
another major hurdle of efficient antitumor function in PD-L1þ
tumor milieus. All this will occur without changing the TCR
specificity.
Here, we demonstrate that PD-1:28 chimeric receptors upgrade
low-avidity T cells and restore effector function of tumor-sup-
pressed human tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL). Through
PD-1:28 signaling, T cells receive support in processes essential for
tumor growth control, that is, stronger proliferation in solid
tumor milieus and prevention of Th2 polarization. Moreover,
PD-1:28–facilitated T-cell support seems to work synergistic with
anti-PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, suggesting that PD-1:28 engi-
neering of T cells can be beneficially combined with checkpoint
blockade and potentially other immunotherapies.
Materials and Methods
Cell lines, PBMCs, and TILs
Cell lines were grown in RPMI1640/1% L-glutamine/1% non-
essential amino acids/1% sodium pyruvate/1% penicillin/strep-
tomycin (RPMI basic), and 12% FCS at 37�C/6.5% CO2. Cell lines
were kept in continuous culture for no longer than 2 months.
Mycoplasma testing was performed monthly using VenorGeM
Classic (Minerva Biolabs). All cell lines were authenticated by flow
cytometry to express the relevant molecules, HLA-A2, tyrosinase
or TCR53 antigen, without or with PD-L1, as required (see
Results). The following cell lines were used: HEK293 cells
(positive for HLA-A2, negative for endogenous PD-L1 by flow
cytometry, obtained from H. Engelmann, Institute of Immu-
nology, Munich, Germany, in 1997) were transduced in our
laboratory to express tyrosinase (HEK/Tyr) or tyrosinase and
PD-L1 (HEK/Tyr/PD-L1). Single-cell clones were selected for
comparable HLA-A2 and tyrosinase expression (see Results);
human melanoma lines: SK-Mel23 (ATCC HTB71, obtained
from M.C. Panelli in 2001, NIH, Bethesda, MD), FM3, FM55,
FM86 (obtained from P. thor Straten in 2014, Danish Cancer
Society,
Copenhagen,
Denmark),
WM115
(ESTDAB-066),
WM266.4A (ESTDAB-076; both purchased in 2003); human
nonmelanoma lines: renal cell cancer RCC-53 and RCC-26
(generated in our laboratory in 1993 and 1991, respectively),
squamous cell carcinoma UT-SCC-15 and glioblastoma U-373
(obtained from co-author P.J. Nelson in 2002; ref. 27). Murine
mastocytoma line P815 (ATCC TIB-64, purchased in 1995) was
authenticated by morphology and expression of FcgR, which is
required for antibody coating.
Murine hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) line 434 originated
in LoxP-TAg mice (28) and was grown in RPMI-basic/12%
FCS/0.05% b-mercaptoethanol (mouse medium). Authentica-
tion was done by testing SV40LT, H2-Db, and PD-L1 expression.
Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were
from healthy donors (HD). Transduced T cells were grown in
RPMI-basic/10% human serum (T-cell medium) and 50 U/mL
IL2, or as indicated. TILs were tissue suspensions prepared
from postsurgery clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) as
described previously (16). Detailed pathologic features are
described in Supplemental Material. Blood and tissues were
collected with donors' and patients' informed consent in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and after approval
by the Institutional Review Board of Ludwig-Maximilian Uni-
versity (Munich, Germany).
Constructs, expression vectors, electroporation, and retroviral
transduction
pMP71 plasmids encoding TCR-T58, TCR-D115 (both tyrosi-
nase-epitope(AA366-377)-specific/HLA-A2-restricted), and TCR53
have been described previously (27). Various costimulatory chi-
meric receptors were designed on the basis of the extracellular
domain (ECD) of PD-1 and the intracellular domain (ICD) of
CD28 containing the signaling motifs YMNM, PRRP, and PYAP
(Fig. 1A). The chimeric sequence PD-1:8tm:28 was composed of
PD-1 ECD (AA1-170), CD8a (AA128-210) as linker and trans-
membrane domain (TMD), followed by CD28 ICD (AA180-220).
PD-1:cys28tm contains PD-1 ECD (AA1-155) followed by CD28
TMD-ICD (AA141-220), which includes the membrane-proximal
cysteine residue at position AA141 (adapted from Prosser and
colleagues; ref. 26). PD-1:28tm contains PD-1 ECD (AA1-165)
followed by CD28 TMD-ICD (AA153-220) omitting the extra-
cellular portion with the cysteine (adapted from Ankri and col-
leagues; ref. 25). PD-1trunc is a truncated PD-1 sequence
(AA1-201; ref. 25). Murine mPD-1:28tm contains murine PD-1
ECD (AA1-169) and murine CD28 TMD-ICD (AA151-218).
Chimeric sequences were ordered from GeneArt.
Chimeric receptors were expressed in human T cells either by
electroporation with in vitro–transcribed RNA cloned in pGEM
vector (provided by S. Milosevic, Medigene GmbH) or by
retroviral transduction using the pMP71 vector as described
previously (29). Murine splenocytes were retrovirally trans-
duced as described previously (29). For experimental details,
see Supplementary Material.
Human melanoma xenograft and murine HCC models
The animal experiments were performed according to and with
approval of the Landesamt f€
ur Gesundheit und Soziales, Berlin,
Germany (HCC model) or they were approved by the Regierung
von Oberbayern, Germany and performed in accordance with the
Animal Care and Use Committee at the Helmholtz Zentrum
M€
unchen (NSG model).
For the xenograft model, NSG mice (Charles River Laboratories;
7–11 weeks old) were injected subcutaneously with 5 � 106
SK-Mel23 cells. Grown to approximately 800 mm3 (15–20 days),
tumors were injected intratumorally with 6 � 106 carboxyfluor-
escein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-labeled T cells. Tumors
were harvested and weighed 4 hours, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 10 days after
adoptive T-cell therapy (ATT). Single-cell suspensions were pre-
pared for flow cytometry as described previously (16). Tumors
were measured using a caliper prior to T-cell injection and before
mice were sacrificed. Tumor volumes were calculated using the
formula; volume ¼ (length � width2) � 0.52. For Matrigel plug

T cells were stimulated with HEK/Tyr or HEK/Tyr/PD-L1 at 1:2
with or without antibodies blocking PD-1/PD-L1 (20 mg/mL,
BioLegend). Human TILs and PBMCs were stimulated at 1:1
with OKT3/PD-L1-Fc (R&D Systems)–loaded P815 cells (each

Results
PD-1:28 chimeric receptor expression depends on the origin of
the transmembrane domain
To facilitate costimulation of T cells in tumor environments, we
designed costimulatory chimeric receptors encompassing the ECD
of PD-1 and the ICD of CD28. Different receptor designs (Fig. 1A)
were compared regarding surface expression and effect on T-cell
function: (i) PD-1:8tm:28; (ii) PD-1:cys28tm; (iii) PD-1:28tm; and
(iv) truncated PD-1 (PD-1trunc) without signaling capacity.
Human activated T cells were electroporated with in vitro–tran-
scribed RNA encoding the various receptors. Four, 24, and 48 hours
later, surface expression of the receptors on CD3þCD8þ and
CD3þCD4þ T cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Four hours
after electroporation, the PD-1trunc receptor was best expressed in
terms of percentage of PD-1þ cells and median fluorescence inten-
sity (median FI; Fig. 1B and C). Percentages of PD-1 surface–
positive cells were not significantly different between PD-1trunc
and either PD-1:cys28tm or PD-1:28tm at 4 and 24 hours after
electroporation. However, median FI was significantly higher for T
cells expressing PD-1trunc compared with PD-1:cys28tm or PD-
1:28tm. PD-1:8tm:28 showed significantly lower surface expression
compared with PD-1trunc, PD-1:cys28tm, and PD-1:28tm regarding
percentage of positive cells and levels of surface expression.
PD-1:cys28tm and PD-1:28tm augment T-cell cytokine secretion
and signaling
Effects of chimeric receptors on T-cell function were analyzed
by assessing TCR-induced cytokine secretion. Human T cells were
transduced to stably express one of two different HLA-A2–restrict-
ed tyrosinase-specific TCR, T58 or D115, followed by transient
expression of chimeric costimulatory receptor (Fig. 2A). These T
cells were stimulated with HLA-A2þ HEK293 cells expressing
either the target antigen tyrosinase (HEK/Tyr) alone or together
with PD-L1, the ligand for PD-1 (HEK/Tyr/PD-L1; Fig. 2B).
Despite artificial expression of tyrosinase, HEK/Tyr cells were low
activators of TCR-T58- or TCR-D115-T cells stimulating less IFNg
secretion and lower cytotoxicity than the natural tumor target
SK-Mel23 (Fig. 2C–E). The HEK-cell system was further used as it
allowed assessing the contribution of PD-L1 interacting with
PD-1:28 chimeric receptors to T-cell function.
TCR-T58- and TCR-D115–expressing T cells with PD-1:28tm or
PD-1:cys28tm secreted significantly more IL2 and IFNg when
stimulated with HEK/Tyr/PD-L1 compared with HEK/Tyr cells
(Fig. 3A). The PD-1:8tm:28 chimeric receptor had no effect on IL2
and IFNg production of T cells expressing either transgenic TCR.
Expression of PD-1trunc did not alter cytokine secretion of TCR-
T58-T cells, but increased cytokine secretion of TCR-D115-T cells
when stimulated with HEK/Tyr/PD-L1 cells, indicating that the
truncated PD-1 is not an inert construct. The effect is likely due to
competitive attenuation of negative signals through T cell–upre-
gulated native PD-1 interacting with PD-L1 on target cells. There-
fore, T cells electroporated with water (control) must be the
reference for experiments assessing PD-1:28 effects.
To demonstrate that improved function was due to specific
ligand receptor binding, blocking antibodies to PD-1 and
PD-L1 were added to cocultures. No effect was seen in cocul-
tures of untransfected T cells with HEK/Tyr or HEK/Tyr/PD-L1
cells. Similarly, no effect was seen when PD-1:28tm T cells were
cocultured with HEK/Tyr cells. However, when blocking anti-
bodies were added to cocultures of PD-1:28tm T cells with
HEK/Tyr/PD-L1 cells, cytokine levels were reduced to those in
HEK/Tyr cocultures, thus representing the levels induced by
the TCR alone (Fig. 3B).
The molecular basis for the significant increase in cytokine
secretion upon stimulation through PD-1:28tm was investigated
by assessing phosphorylation of MAP kinase ERK and ribosomal
protein S6 (RPS6) using phospho-flow cytometry. After stimula-
tion with HEK/Tyr/PD-L1, phosphorylation of ERK was enhanced
4.4-fold in PD-1:28tm–engineered T cells compared with water
control. Regarding pRPS6, 43% of PD-1:28tm T cells were positive
for the phosphorylated form compared with 33% in control (Fig.
3C and D). Although these differences were not significant, there
was a clear and reproducible trend toward increased phosphor-
ylation of both ERK and RPS6 when T cells received dual stim-
ulation through PD-1:28tm and their TCRs.
PD-1:cys28tm and PD-1:28tm upgrade low-avidity T cells to
achieve cytokine secretion comparable with high-avidity T cells
Next, we assessed whether PD-1:28 engineering could improve
functional responses of T cells with low-avidity TCRs recognizing
tumor-expressed self-antigens.
T58 and D115 are high- and low-avidity TCRs, respectively, that
recognize the same HLA-A0201–restricted tyrosinase epitope.
Low-avidity TCR-D115–expressing T cells secreted significantly
less IL2 and IFNg than T cells expressing TCR-T58 when stimu-
lated with HEK/Tyr/PD-L1 target cells (Fig. 4A). TCR-D115-trans-
genic T cells coexpressing PD-1:28tm or PD-1:cys28tm showed
augmented cytokine secretion that reached levels comparable
with high-avidity TCR-T58–transduced T cells stimulated with
PD-L1þ target cells. Thus, activation of the costimulatory cascade

 TCR-D115-T cells increased cytotoxicity against PD-L1þ HEK/Tyr
cells reaching levels equal to TCR-T58-T cells, while the cytotoxicity
against PD-L1� HEK/Tyr was unchanged.
PD-1:28tm engineering not only enhanced T-cell response
against HEK/Tyr/PD-L1 cells but also enabled T cells to respond
stronger to tumor lines with endogenous expression of antigens
and PD-L1. The extent of functional improvement followed the
level of PD-L1 surface expression on the tumor cells. Melanoma
lines grown in standard culture exhibited low PD-L1 surface
expression (FI range, 180–540) and PD-1:28tm-engineered
TCR-D115-T cells reached on average 1.4-fold (range, 1.3- to
1.6-fold change) higher IFNg and IL2 secretion compared with
TCR-D115-T cells without PD-1:28tm (Fig. 4C, and data not
shown). PD-L1 was strongly induced on SK-Mel23 grown as
3D spheroids, and significantly higher T-cell numbers and more
apoptotic tumor cells were recovered from spheroids cocultured
with PD-1:28tm–engineered TCR-D115-T cells compared with
TCR-D115-T cells without PD-1:28tm (Fig. 4D). Higher PD-L1
levels were also seen on nonmelanoma lines (FI range,
850–1830) that express the natural tumor antigen recognized
by TCR53 (27). Consistent with the PD-L1 expression on
TCR53 target cells, TCR53-T cells derived strong benefit from
PD-1:28tm engineering with 1.4- to 2.5-fold improvement of
IFNg secretion (Fig. 4E). These results indicate that T cells will
benefit more from PD-1:28tm engineering in tumor milieus
where PD-L1 is highly expressed.
PD-1:28tm can reinstate function in unresponsive tumor-
infiltrating T lymphocytes from human RCC and can work in
synergy with checkpoint blockade therapy
We previously demonstrated that TILs from human RCC tissue
show deficits in degranulation and IFNg secretion, in part due to
insufficient activation of signaling molecules AKT, ERK, and JNK
(16). As CD28 costimulation fosters activation of intracellular
signaling molecules, including AKT, ERK, and JNK, we sought to
determine whether costimulation through PD-1:28tm could
restore functionality in unresponsive TILs. Therefore, sorted CD3þ
TILs from RCC tissues were electroporated with PD-1:28tm or
water and stimulated with target cells (P815 loaded with anti-
CD3/PD-L1-Fc). CD3þ TILs electroporated with water did not
secrete IFNg upon stimulation, while CD3þ TILs electroporated
with PD-1:28tm clearly produced IFNg at levels comparable with
PBMCs of HD (Fig. 5A). Similar improvement was observed for
IL2 secretion (Fig. 5B). As TILs in the tumor microenvironment
can be polarized toward Th2 or regulatory IL10 programs, we
addressed the question whether facilitated costimulation through
PD-1:28 might unleash undesirable Th2 or IL10 cytokines. How-
ever, neither mock-transfected nor PD-1:28tm–transfected TILs (n
¼ 3) secreted detectable levels of IL4, IL5, IL13, or IL10 (data not
shown). These cytokines were detected at low levels in super-
natants of one (IL4) and two (IL13) HD-PBMCs, yet levels
were not augmented when costimulated through PD-1:28tm.

Thus, costimulation through PD-1:28tm can reinstate functional-
ity in TILs that had lost activity in the tumor microenvironment.

Presumably, ATT will be combined with checkpoint blockade
using anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies. To explore whether
PD-1:28tm-engineered T cells would benefit in this situation, we
added titrated concentrations of anti-PD-L1 antibody to cocul-
tures of TCR-D115/Mock or TCR-D115/PD-1:28tm T cells with
HEK/Tyr or HEK/Tyr/PD-L1 and measured secreted IFNg. Anti-
PD-L1 antibody did not change IFN-g levels if the target cell was
negative for PD-L1 (Fig. 5C). If the target expressed PD-L1 and the
T cell had no PD-1:28tm, IFNg levels increased with raising anti-
PD-L1 antibody concentration, presumably due to interrogating
negative signals mediated through endogenously upregulated
PD-1. Of note, in cocultures of PD-L1þ target cells with
PD-1:28tm T cells, low concentrations of anti-PD-L1 antibody
strongly augmented IFNg while high antibody concentration
prevented this induction. PD-1:28tm-engineered T cells com-
bined with checkpoint blockade secreted significantly more
IFNg compared with T cells without PD-1:28tm, indicating that
PD-1:28tm T-cell engineering can work in synergy with check-
point blockade therapy.
PD-1:28tm fosters intratumoral T-cell proliferation and enables
better tumor control in a human melanoma xenograft model
Effects of PD-1:28tm expression in T cells in vivo was studied
using a human melanoma xenograft mouse model based on NSG
mice carrying established vascularized subcutaneous melanoma
tumors formed by the SK-Mel23 melanoma line (Fig. 6A). CFSE-
labeled TCR-D115/Mock or TCR-D115/PD-1:28tm T cells were
injected intratumorally into tumors (802 mm3 � 83, mean �
SEM) and analyzed at 4 h, 1, 2, 4, 6 and 10 d after ATT by flow
cytometry. It was observed that TCR-D115/Mock T cells stained
positive for PD-1 on 1, 2, and 4 days after ATT. Thereafter, PD-1
staining decreased, but never completely disappeared (Fig. 6B and
C). This temporary expression of endogenous PD-1 suggests that
T-cell activation occurred within the tumor microenvironment, as
PD-1 is expressed on recently activated T cells (30). Activation
lasted until day 4 after ATT. For TCR-D115/PD-1:28tm T cells,
temporary expression of endogenous PD-1 could not be distin-
guished from the transgenic PD-1:28tm expression. However, a
temporary increase in median FI of PD-1 was observed with
similar kinetics.
TCR-D115/PD-1:28tm T cells lost CFSE intensity more rapidly
and strongly than TCR-D115-T cells without PD-1:28tm (Fig. 6D
and E). The difference was significant at all time points (Fig. 6D),
indicating that TCR-D115/PD-1:28tm T cells responded faster and
stronger to antigen-specific stimulation in the tumor microenvi-
ronment than TCR-D115 T cells without the chimeric costimu-
latory receptor. Survival could not be assessed in this model as T
cells were injected into large tumors to ensure establishment of a
challenging microenvironment. Animal regulatory restrictions
did not allow extension of the observation time. However, com-
pared over 7 days (Fig. 6F), tumors injected with TCR-D115/
PD-1:28tm T cells grew slower (median 1.5-fold increase) com-
pared with tumors injected with TCR-D115 T cells without PD-
1:28tm (median 2.0-fold increase). While acknowledging the
small sample size and absence of statistical significance, the data
suggest that PD-1:28tm costimulation can improve antitumor
function of low-avidity T cells in the tumor milieu. Analysis of
T cells recovered from 7-day tumors support this evidence: Higher
T-cell numbers were found in tumors injected with TCR-D115/
PD-1:28tm T cells with higher percentages of Ki-67þ cells and
lower frequencies of T cells expressing PD-L1, compared with

 tumors injected with TCR-D115/Mock T cells (Fig. 6G). Higher
T-cell numbers and better tumor control after ATT with TCR-
D115/PD-1:28tm T cells are consistent with results from the
spheroid model (Fig. 4D). Low T-cell numbers and high PD-L1
expression may explain the observed poorer tumor control
through TCR-D115/Mock T cells, as PD-L1 on T cells has been
described to inhibit T-cell expansion and function (31). Fur-
thermore, in a Matrigel-killing assay in situ over 2 days (Fig.
6H), TCR-D115/PD-1:28tm T cells achieved on average 76.2%
of SK-Mel23 killing, while killing through TCR-D115/MOCK
T cells was much lower (59.3% on average).
PD-1:28tm shifts the cytokine balance of TILs in favor of
antitumor Th1 cytokines in vivo
Limitations of NSG xenograft models led us to analyze the
impact of PD-1:28tm chimeric receptors in a fully murine system.
In the autochthonous HCC mouse model, T cells become
exhausted after an initial phase of antitumor activity, and survival
could be prolonged with anti-PD-L1 (28). To investigate whether
PD-1:28tm could rescue exhausted T cells, splenocytes were isolated
from mice 15 weeks after initiation of oncogenesis (it is assumed
that T cells have lost control over tumor growth at this time point;
ref. 28) and transduced with Thy1.1 to allow tracking after ATT,
alone or together with a murine PD-1:28tm (mPD-1:28tm). ATT was
given to LoxP-TAg mice that carried occult tumors (week 12 after
oncogene activation; Fig. 7B). Although ATT did not prolong
survival (not shown), notable differences were observed in the TIL
populations after ATT with T cells with or without mPD-1:28tm.
Globally, therewere nodifferences inpercentagesofCD3þ Tcells or
CD19þ B cells in tumors or spleens of mice with or without ATT
(Fig. 7C and D). However, the cytokine profile of TILs in the PD-
1:28tm-negative ATT was shifted toward Th2þTh17 cytokines com-
pared with splenocytes that were dominated by Th1 cytokines (Fig.
7E and F). PD-1 can inhibit Tc1/Th1 responses in the tumor
microenvironment through SHP-2 (32) and, indeed, very high
levels of PD-1 were observed among TILs (Fig. 7E, inset). Thus,
endogenous PD-1 induction in the tumor microenvironment
might contribute to the Th2 polarization of TILs. TILs from mice
having received ATT with mPD-1:28tm-positive T cells had a more
favorable Th1/Th2 balance with less Th2þTh17 cytokines com-
pared with TILs from mice given mPD-1:28tm-negative ATT, yet
with a notable increase in IL10.

PD-1:28 Receptor Upgrades Low-Avidity T cells for ATT

 cytokine secretion and degranulation and supports TCR-indepen-
dent programs downstream of AKT/mTOR, such as survival, cell-
cycle progress, glucose consumption, and restoration of lytic
proteins, which are particularly valuable in a restricting environ-
ment (23, 24). Human CD8þ T cells lose CD28 costimulatory
receptor expression during effector–cell differentiation (34), and
epithelial cancers generally do not express cognate ligands CD80
or CD86 (35, 36); thus, T cells are unable to receive proper
costimulation in this situation. In the context of ATT, low-avidity
T cells may not be sufficiently active for tumor elimination due to
low functional responses. Yet, they represent the majority of
antitumor-reactive T cells and are relatively resistant to the sup-
pressive tumor environment (13, 37). Harnessing them for the
antitumor response would enlarge and enrich the spectrum of T
cells for ATT. As previous data have shown that PD-1:28 receptors
can improve TCR- and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engi-
neered T cells (25, 26, 38, 39), we engineered low-avidity T cells
with a PD-1:28 chimeric signaling receptor to explore whether
their functional activity could be enhanced allowing their inclu-
sion in a library of TCRs for ATT.
We show that PD-1:28 chimeric receptor can be stably
expressed on the surface of human T cells. Surprisingly, the
CD8tm-linker destabilized surface expression, although similar
sequences are effectively used in expression constructs of CAR
receptors. We demonstrate that ligation of PD-1:28 overcomes
important hurdles in ATT. PD-1:28 engineering invigorated
TILs that were functionally disabled in human RCC environ-
ments. These TILs recovered Th1-cytokine secretion without
unleashing Th2 or IL10 programs presumably based on resto-
ration of ERK and AKT pathways as shown in our in vitro
coculture system and previous work using similar receptors
(25, 26). PD-1:28 ameliorated T-cell inhibition that involved
native PD-1/PD-L1 interactions and induced the costimulatory
signaling pathway. The combined effect was stronger on the
low-avidity TCR-D115-T cells compared with the high-avidity
TCR-T58-T cells. Indeed, PD-1:28 cosignaling upgraded low-
avidity TCR-D115-T cells to approximate cytokine and cyto-
toxic response levels of high-avidity TCR-T58-T cells. Thus, PD-
1:28 engineering should allow harnessing the advantages of
low-avidity T cells for the antitumor response.
PD-1:28 engineering enhanced the T-cell effector response
against melanoma, RCC, squamous cell carcinoma, and glio-
blastoma cell lines. Response enhancement depended on PD-
L1 surface expression level on the tumor cells. Thus, PD-1:28
engineering will deliver benefit in conditions with high PD-L1
expression, that is, in tumor milieus. Further evidence that PD-
1:28tm engineering can support T cells in a "hostile" tumor
microenvironment was provided by a human xenograft model
using large SK-Mel23 tumors with established T-cell–inhibitory
conditions. Here, as was observed in SK-Mel23 spheroids, PD-
1:28tm–engineered low-avidity TCR-D115-T cells proliferated
significantly more and reached higher absolute cell numbers
compared with TCR-D115-T cells without the chimeric recep-
tor. TCR-D115/PD-1:28tm T cells also showed higher tumor cell
killing. Proliferation and killing are important prerequisites for
CD8þ T cells to cause tumor shrinkage (19, 40, 41). Tumors
injected with low-avidity D115/PD-1:28tm T cells grew slower
over 7 days than tumors injected with TCR-D115 T cells. In
future the xenograft animal experiments will be extended to
larger sample sizes with longer observation times based on
regulatory authority approval.
To determine the potential effect of PD-1:28tm on tumor
progression, a murine model of autochthonous HCC was used
where tumors develop after activation of the SV40-TAg (28). This
tumor model resembles the human situation in its slow course of
tumor progression, spanning up to 35 weeks from initiating the
oncogenic process until death from tumor load. ATT using T cells
engineered with a murine PD-1:28tm showed positive effects on T-
cell polarization. Most notable was the prevention of Th2 and
Th17 cytokine secretion. The reduction of Th2 cytokines may be
attributed to PD-1:28tm deflecting native Th2-polarizing PD-1/
PD-L1 interactions into Th1-favoring costimulatory pathways.
Similarly, augmentation of Th1 cytokines was observed in
patients treated with PD-1 blockade (41). ATT with PD-1:28tm-
positive T cells also resulted in more IL10, which may enhance
cytotoxicity and IFNg secretion by CD8þ T cells and tumor
growth, but may also suppress antitumor immunity (42, 43).
Despite positive effects of PD-1:28tm on T-cell performance in
ATT, this was not sufficient to change tumor growth characteristics
in this murine tumor model. Effects on tumor growth have been
documented in a mouse model with subcutaneous tumors over-
expressing an artificial antigen (ovalbumin) and PD-L1 (44). In
our model with tumor development over an extended time period
using native antigen and PD-L1 expression, the tumor immune
escape may be more complex (45). Overcoming suppression
likely requires additional supportive measurements beyond
PD1:28 chimeric receptors, such as inhibition of IL10. This is in
line with clinical results of ATT using TILs where benefit was
achieved only after patient preconditioning with lymphodeple-
tion and radiation in a multiple TIL injection regimen and
coadministration of IL2 (19, 46). We have noted that much
higher T-cell numbers can be recovered from xenograft tumors
after 7 days when IL15 is administrated intraperitoneally at the
day of ATT (data not shown).
In summary, we show that cytokine secretion of functionally
disabled human TILs can be restored through a PD-1:28tm recep-
tor. PD-1:28tm mediated a functional upgrading of low-avidity T
cells to the level seen in high-avidity T cells. As a consequence,
low-avidity T cells previously considered to be therapeutically
inefficient can now be considered for ATT. As the PD-1:28 engi-
neering does not modify the TCR sequence, adverse effects on
specificity are not expected, thus making this a safer approach than
TCR affinity enhancement (3, 4, 10–12, 47). PD-1:28 chimeric
receptors have wider potential applications also for CAR-expres-
sing T cells, where these engineered cells have shown better
migration and tumor infiltration (38). Although some benefits
on T-cell function and tumor control were observed, more
advanced in vivo models are needed to better document an
improved antitumor response. It may be that the potential impact
of PD-1:28 receptors on tumor control cannot be reliably visu-
alized in a murine system (48) as mouse T cells do not lose CD28
(34, 49) and, therefore, may not share the same necessity of
facilitated costimulation with human T cells. Moreover, mouse
models often fail to correctly predict clinical efficacy. New models,
such as advanced tumor spheroid 3D cultures, may be helpful in
this regard.
Checkpoint inhibition therapies using PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies
may benefit from a combination with PD-1:28–engineered T-cell
therapy as therapeutically applied anti-PD-L1/anti-PD-1 antibo-
dies may not reach saturation of all target molecules (50). The
supportive effects of PD-1:28 engineering imparted on T-cell
function make it an attractive tool for ATT.
