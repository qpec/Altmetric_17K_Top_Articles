Abstract
There is a need to increase people’s engagement with and connection to nature, both for
human well-being and the conservation of nature itself. In order to suggest ways for people
to engage with nature and create a wider social context to normalise nature engagement,
The Wildlife Trusts developed a mass engagement campaign, 30 Days Wild. The campaign
asked people to engage with nature every day for a month. 12,400 people signed up for 30
Days Wild via an online sign-up with an estimated 18,500 taking part overall, resulting in an
estimated 300,000 engagements with nature by participants. Samples of those taking part
were found to have sustained increases in happiness, health, connection to nature and pro-
nature behaviours. With the improvement in health being predicted by the improvement in
happiness, this relationship was mediated by the change in connection to nature.
Introduction
A number of governments are implementing policies to increase people’s engagement with and
connection to nature [1,2] owing to the widespread decline of the world’s biodiversity [3] and
the benefits that connection brings to pro-environmental behaviours [4] and human well-
being [5]. Improving people’s connection with nature is emerging as an important societal
issue (linked to well-being and biodiversity loss [6]) that has been the focus of several cam-
paigns, for example, The Wild Network [7] and the David Suzuki 30x30 Nature Challenge
(30x30.davidsuzuki.org).
However, to make a societal impact, there is a need to develop and evaluate large scale and
accessible nature engagement interventions that can bring about sustained increases in people’s
connectedness to nature and the associated benefits to well-being and pro-nature behaviours.
Further, from a public health perspective, nature provides a new paradigm for public health [8]
and is an untapped resource in upstream health promotion interventions for populations [9,10].
Given such comprehensive evidence of nature’s health benefits, health promotion partner-
ships with the environmental sector have been recommended [10]. Recently this has come to
the fore with thirty-four conservation NGOs lobbying the UK government for one-percent of
the public health budget to be invested in preventative nature-based solutions by 2018 [11].

 Within this context, this paper details the development and evaluation of a mass participation
campaign designed to connect people with nature and bring about the associated benefits to
health, well-being and pro-nature behaviours.
The majority of people spend most of their time indoors and when outside do not con-
sciously interact with nature [12]. As the proportion of people living in towns and cities
increases, improving our engagement with nature will increasingly be based on interactions
with nature within urban landscapes [13]. There is a need to consider how more ‘mundane’ or
‘nearby nature’ [14] can be valued and provide an everyday route for people to better under-
stand their connection to nature [15] in order to improve both environmental awareness [16]
and human well-being.
Previous research has argued for the need for engagement with nature [15] or has focussed
on the factors that mediate human relationships with everyday nature [12]. Given the health
benefits of nature, for a review see [9], research that tackles the issue of engagement with nature
is needed, particularly focusing on mass-engagement that can normalise nature within people’s
day-to-day lives and social contexts [12]. Simple interventions encouraging people to notice
the ‘good things’ in nature each day have been shown to increase nature connection [17]. Such
tools have potential value as part of wider campaigns, but there is a need to provide a variety of
approaches to cater for individual differences and preferences. To this end, the 30 Days Wild
campaign set out to demonstrate the multi-faceted values of nature to individuals and to
encourage people to value nature more highly in their own life, with an emphasis on common-
place and accessible nature experiences.
This paper outlines the development of the 30 Days Wild campaign before introducing the
results of an evaluation of the impact of participating. In order to provide further context, the
paper moves beyond simple nature exposure to consider the importance of the human-nature
relationship and the links between nature engagement, well-being and pro-environmental
behaviours. The evaluation sets out to test for measurable changes in happiness, general health,
nature connection, and conservation behaviours.
The Human-Nature Relationship and Connection to Nature
Technology increasingly shapes and defines us [18], to the point where people see themselves
as separate from nature [19]. Technological advances have led to agricultural and then indus-
trial revolutions that have resulted in populations adopting contrasting lives in towns and cities
where they can become detached from the natural environment [20].
For the benefit of nature and the well-being of humankind, there is a need to engage people
with the natural world and to encourage them to consider their relationship to it. This deeper
connection with nature is fundamentally concerned with an individual’s sense of inclusion in
nature, along with their sense of self [21]. Central to this is understanding our interconnected-
ness with nature [5] and an experiential and affective sense of belonging to the natural world
[22]. The development of an ecological-self is also related to pro-environmental behaviours
and a greater respect for nature [5].
Connection to nature is emerging as an important construct for well-being, alongside estab-
lished societal factors such as income and education [23]. Nature connectedness is associated
with pro-environmental behaviour [4] and aspects of human well-being, such as life satisfac-
tion [22], vitality [24] and happiness [23,25]. Connection to nature has a role in human health
as it helps meet the challenges of stress as well as providing resilience [24], and is considered as
a relevant construct in health promotion campaigns [26].
Further, people with a greater connection to nature are more likely to spend time in green
spaces [27], bringing about the more general health benefits of a simple exposure to nature

 outlined in a number of recent reviews [9,10,28]. These reviews cover a comprehensive and
diverse body of research that demonstrates exposure to nature can lead to general health bene-
fits such as reducing hyper-tension, respiratory tract and cardiovascular illnesses, and also to
positive well-being benefits such as improved vitality and mood, and reduced anxiety. Finally,
the reviews show that exposure to nature is known to restore attention capacity and mental
fatigue.
Improving Connection to Nature
Given this robust body of evidence for the positive impact of engaging with nature on human
health and pro-nature behaviours, it can be argued that connection to nature is both an impor-
tant goal [29] and a potential new focus for health promotion [4]. However, the applied chal-
lenge of encouraging nature connection has also been highlighted [29]. Research has shown
that connection to nature can be increased in the short-term [30] with sustained increases in
nature connection being achieved through specific interventions [17], but there have been few
manipulations of connection to nature. Nonetheless, an understanding of the pathways and
activities that can lead to increased connection to nature is emerging [17,30].
With regard to interventions, there is some evidence that educational programmes can
increase nature connectedness. For example, using a measurement instrument designed for the
study, two environmental education programmes (a week-long camp and multiple field trips)
were found to significantly increase children’s connection to nature [31]. Similarly, two and
three day workshops have led to increases in connection to nature [32], although sustained
increases weren’t investigated. Similarly, education programmes with creative arts activities
have led to increases in connection to nature, whereas knowledge-based activities did not
improve nature connection [33]. This type of approach requires substantial time and resources
with a formal engagement by those taking part. Alongside this there is a need to develop
approaches that fit with people’s everyday working lives, quite often in an urban environment
[15].
It is also necessary to provide appropriate routes to increase connection to nature. For
example, when analysing the ‘good things’ people noticed in nature, the most common themes
were the sensations of nature and noticing the sights and sounds of the natural world [17].
Growth and temporal changes were also noted often, with people also being engaged by specific
aspects of nature, including the activity of wildlife, beauty and wonder, and how the weather
interacts with the natural environment. This work provides a framework for connecting people
with nature in order to realise the associated benefits for health and well-being.
The 30 Days Wild Approach
As many people tend not to consciously engage with nature [12] there is a need to draw atten-
tion to the natural world [17] and suggest activities for people to engage with nature. This also
creates a wider social context in order to normalise nature engagement. Research suggests that
online campaigns can engage large populations and motivate people to behavioural change
[34]. In the case of 30 Days Wild, mass engagement through a clear campaign identity and a
simple call to action to ‘do something wild every day’ during June 2015 provided a framework
to promote engagement with nature through a wide range of suggested activities. Sharing par-
ticipation via social media allowed the creation of a wider social context to encourage, extend
and maintain participation. An emphasis was also placed on self-direction, in that people were
encouraged to be creative and design their own activities.
The suggested activities were labelled as ‘Random Acts of Wildness’, with approximately
180 everyday activities being proposed during the campaign development phase. In order to

 develop a wide variety of potential activities, two categories were used, each with a three point
scale:
Level of immersion: ‘full’, e.g. activities which required an intense level of dedication or time
like climbing a mountain, ‘intermediary’, e.g. activities which required a medium level of
involvement like identifying something new in nature, and ‘momentary’, e.g. sensory or fleeting
activities like smelling a flower.
Technicality: ‘high’, e.g. requires specialist location or expert help, ‘intermediary’, e.g. activi-
ties which could require a field guide or online support, and ‘none’, e.g. activities which didn’t
require any knowledge or expertise.
The activities were also divided into four main types:
Noticing–more momentary and transient experiences and activities, e.g. taking a moment
to smell a wild flower or to briefly watch a butterfly.
Sharing–sharing nature experiences and activities and how they made the participant feel.
The intention here was to prompt self-contemplation [30] and thinking about the value of
nature. Sharing was also a way to amplify awareness of the campaign, particularly via social
media.
Doing–activities that could directly or indirectly benefit nature, e.g. leaving a patch of grass
to grow long, avoiding use of pesticides in the garden, contacting a local elected representative
about a wildlife issue.
Connecting–activities that could help the participant to forge a stronger connection with
nature. This was a broad category and examples included eating something wild (e.g. a fresh
hawthorn leaf), following a bee, creating art from natural objects, and exploring a local wild
place for the first time.
The activities and precise wording were then refined with reference to five pathways to
nature connection currently being developed in on-going research at the University of Derby.
Identified through two online surveys structured around the nine values of the biophilia
hypothesis [35], these pathways include: contact, emotion, meaning, compassion and engage-
ment with natural beauty. All of these pathways were found to be predictors of connection
with nature, whereas knowledge-based activities were not. This research also found that a walk-
ing intervention, with activities operationalising the identified pathways, can significantly
increase connection to nature, compared to walking in nature alone or walking in and engaging
with the built environment. Therefore, where possible, reference was made to these five path-
ways, with purely information and knowledge-based activities kept to a minimum.
The ‘good things’ in nature were also considered during this review in order to ensure that
the suggested activities tapped into aspects of nature that have been found to be valued by peo-
ple when they connect with nature [17]. As an example, this process revealed that potential
activities for 30 Days Wild with an emotional pathway were scarce in number, so suggestions
for revisions were made, such as changing ‘go for a lunchtime walk; what did you see?’ to ‘go
for a lunchtime walk; how did it make you feel?’.
Further, as individuals and their behaviours are influenced by values and emotions, the
framing of conservation communications was considered [36]. For example the activity of
walking barefoot in nature was likely to engage the value ‘unity with nature’ and the activity
‘scribble a poem’ was likely to engage the value ‘creativity’. This values screening process was
undertaken by The Public Interest Research Centre. Decisions were then made regarding
which of the activities to include in the campaign.
This work also informed the choice of frames used in the promotion of the campaign, nota-
bly highlighting how amazing nature is, encouraging shared experiences in nature and support-
ing self-direction and creativity in the context of the natural world. This process culminated in
the final list of 101 Random Acts of Wildness activities.

 The 101 activities were then promoted on the 30 Days Wild website to guide and inspire
people to find something wild to do each day of the month. Thirty activities were also pub-
lished in a campaign booklet that was sent to participants who signed up online, either in a dig-
ital or paper format. Participants were encouraged to share their ideas and experiences on
blogs and social media.
The activities formed the key content for the campaign and were presented within a wider
package of materials for participants, including the booklet, a wall-chart (to record activities
each day during June), badges and stickers. A number of communications resources were
developed, including a bloggers pack, a twitter account, a Facebook group, social media graph-
ics, a campaign film, a series of 12 emails sent to participants throughout June and dedicated
web pages at mywildlife.org.uk/30DaysWild
The 30 Days Wild campaign was not framed as a public health or health promotion cam-
paign, although benefits to health and well-being were a likely outcome. The primary objective
was to encourage people to make more time for nature in their lives and thus value nature
more highly. There was a focus on ‘everyday nature’, e.g., suggesting that people convert a walk
to the bus stop into a walk with wildlife.
The evaluation focussed on the following outcomes: connection to nature; well-being;
improved health; and an increase in conservation behaviours. Not only would these out-
comes have an inherent societal benefit, they would also demonstrate success to a wide
audience.
Materials and Methods
Design
The evaluation used a 1x3 (A-B-B) repeated measures time-series design where self-reported
scores were taken at three time-points: pre-participation, post-participation and follow-up at
two months. The clear rationale, robust theoretical basis, clear delivery content and method
towards defined outcomes, meet checklist criteria for public health interventions [37]. This
design approach can provide convincing evidence that an intervention is effective within a pub-
lic health context [38] and has a long history of success in non-medical research [39], especially
where an intervention has little potential for harm [40].
As with similar designs for evaluations of applied nature activities [33] and large-scale
health promotion campaigns [41] a Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) was not a practical
option. Further, the chosen approach to design is acceptable when measures can be expected to
be relatively stable over time [40]. For example, in the UK, monthly figures (n = 1000) from the
Office of National Statistics (ONS) show that happiness remains constant through May to
October with any variation in late Autumn and early Spring being of small magnitudes (e.g.
approximately 1%), [42]. The chronology of the campaign development and evaluation is
mapped out in Fig 1.
Participants
Of the 12,400 people who formally signed up for 30 Days Wild, 2305 successfully completed
the baseline pre-participation survey, 344 both the pre-participation and the post-partici-
pation survey in July, 269 both the pre-participation and the follow-up survey in Septem-
ber, and 126 participants successfully completed all three time points (Table 1). To ensure
a high level of engagement with the thirty days available, only those who had signed up
for 30 Days Wild within the first week of June were included in the post-participation
surveys.

 Materials
A survey was used to evaluate the impact of the campaign on participants. The survey was
framed as a ‘Wildness Quiz’ in order to engage participants within the communications style of
the campaign and also to reduce demand characteristics. This survey did not need to be exten-
sive; single item measures are routinely used by the ONS to monitor population well-being
[42].
In addition to questions about age and gender, the survey measured connection to nature,
pro-nature behaviour, health and well-being. Well-being was measured with a single question
on general happiness with an 11-point scale that has been shown to correlate highly with
multi-item well-being scales (e.g. Oxford Happiness Index and Satisfaction with Life Scale) and
offers a reliable and valid measure of well-being for community surveys [43]. Health was mea-
sured with a single item based on a 5-point rating scale from excellent to poor, which has been
used successfully in a range of published research, for example [44]. Nature connection was
measured with single item about Inclusion of Nature in Self [45]. This measure assesses the
proportion of nature included in one’s concept of self, using pairs of circles (self and nature)

 with a varying degree of overlap. An online version of this tool was used in which participants
scored 0 to 100 depending on the degree of overlap [46]. The Inclusion of Nature in Self (INS)
scale measures a cognitive aspect of connection to nature and has been found to correlate with
environmental attitudes and behaviours [47] as well as aspects of well-being such as anxiety
[23].
Finally, as a measure of pro-nature conservation behaviours does not exist, a series of five
questions on this theme were developed. These asked about participants’ actions (such as feed-
ing birds, growing wildlife friendly plants and doing conservation work away from home)
using ‘Yes, I do this’ and ‘No, I don’t do this’ as response options. The number of ‘yes’
responses were summed. In order to gauge participation level, the post-participation surveys
included a question asking participants to estimate how many days they had done something
‘wild’ in June.
Ethics Statement
All participants provided informed consent, recorded via an online tick box labelled ‘Yes–I
accept’ that followed a written brief on a ‘Your Consent’ page. The Psychology Research Ethics
Committee at the University of Derby approved the study and consent procedure.
Procedure
Invitations to complete the ‘Wildness Quiz’ were included in the sign-up process for 30 Days
Wild. Participants who followed this link were directed to a consent page prior to a page featur-
ing the questions and a short debrief. Participants then spent time taking part in their selected
activities as described above, in an unmonitored fashion. Those who had completed the pre-
participation survey were invited by e-mail to complete the post-participation survey in July
and the follow-up survey in September.
Data Analysis
SPSS version 22 was used for all analyses. Paired samples t-tests were used to investigate differ-
ences between pre and post participation, and pre and follow-up results. To investigate differ-
ences between all three time points a 1 x 3 (Time) repeated measures ANOVA with pairwise
comparisons was conducted. To explore the relationship between improvements in nature con-
nection, happiness and health over June and the mechanism behind the change in health, a
mediation analysis was conducted. A Bootstrapping approach was used with 5,000 bootstrap
re-samples at a 95% confidence interval, as this method has more power than the sobel or
causal steps tests [48]. Multiple regression analysis was also undertaken, but is not reported
owing to similar results.
Results
Pre to Post-participation to Follow-up Results
There were statistically significant increases from pre-participation baseline to post-participa-
tion for connection to nature, health, happiness and number of reported conservation behav-
iours (Tables 2 and 3). There were also statistically significant increases from pre-participation
baseline to follow-up for connection to nature, health, happiness and number of reported con-
servation behaviours (Tables 2 and 3). ANOVA analysis of pre to post-participation to follow-
up results revealed that time had a statistically significant impact on connection to nature, hap-
piness, health and conservation behaviour scores (Table 3). Pairwise comparisons indicted

 significant differences (p < 0.01) between pre-participation and post-participation, and signifi-
cant differences between pre-participation and follow-up for all four outcome measures.
Relationship between Health, Happiness and Nature Connection
Mediation analysis on the pre to post-participation data was conducted using improvement in
happiness as a predictor of improvement in health, with improvement in nature connectedness
as a mediator. The model met all the criteria for mediation [49]. Both sobel and bootstrap
results show the indirect effect to be significant (Table 4). The analysis was repeated on the
pre-participation to follow-up data. The mediation model met all the criteria for mediation.
Both sobel and bootstrap results show the indirect effect to be significant (Table 5).
Discussion
There is a need to increase people’s engagement with and connection to nature for nature’s and
human well-being. The results of the evaluation show that the mass engagement campaign, 30
Days Wild, led to sustained increases in connection to nature, also bringing associated benefits
to happiness, health, and pro-nature behaviours. In doing so it met the criteria for success of
population-based public health interventions [39]. The campaign approach and evaluation
results are of value as they combine, and offer potential solutions for, societal issues of well-
being and nature conservation. The evaluation also extends previous research on large-scale

 campaigns that have focussed on specific health outcomes to engage large populations and
motivate people to specific behaviour change [34]. Within this context it should be noted that
the promotion of 30 Days Wild did not focus on health, well-being or conservation outcomes,
but simply conveyed a message that being in contact with nature makes life better.
The campaign success in engaging a large number of participants and delivering outcomes
is notable given governmental and public health interest in policies and interventions to
increase human well-being. There are also indications that the 30 Days Wild campaign can
lead to nature being valued [14], bringing about improved connection to nature and pro-con-
servation behaviours [13,15] within the context of everyday life. The evaluation provides evi-
dence that conscious connections to nature can and should be part of a healthy lifestyle.
The results also provide some indication of the relationship between connection to nature,
well-being and health outcomes. The replicated mediation analysis suggests that the improve-
ment in reported general health was related to the improvement in happiness, mediated by the
increase in nature connection. Links between nature connection and happiness have been
established previously [50], but understanding the link to health is of value. Our findings sug-
gest that connection to nature may provide people with resilience to meet the challenges of
everyday life, while also facilitating exercise, social contact and a sense of purpose [24]. The
mechanisms require more focused research, but this result highlights the role of nature in a
happy and healthy lifestyle and our embedded place in the natural world [8]. This adds impor-
tant dimensions to our paradigm for human well-being.
Although the design observed good practice [37–41], limitations and key assumptions
should be acknowledged. Firstly, although healthy, the sample size as a proportion of those tak-
ing part was very small. The evaluation was kept short so as to encourage participation, but it is
acknowledged that the results may not fully reflect the outcomes experienced by the majority
of those taking part. For example, those completing all three time points may have been moti-
vated by a greater connection to nature. Secondly, there is an assumption that those taking part
did engage with nature in some way. Based on post-hoc estimates of days ‘wild’, the majority of
participants reported engagement of 25 days or more, but the reliability of such an estimate
can be questioned. Without observational data this is hard to test further. A third assumption

 is that taking part led to measureable experiences, with responses that could be detected by the
measures used. Finally, participants may have been primed by the questions and therefore
offered more positive outcomes in July and then again two months later in September. This is
difficult to overcome and an issue with any pre-post self-report evaluation of an intervention.
However, a recent systematic review found little evidence to support such demand characteris-
tic effects [51]. Within the research identified by the review were two RCT studies of a similar
design to the present research. These showed that awareness of study aims did not impact self-
reported outcomes [52,53]. Further, the campaign was not widely promoted with regards to
well-being, and precautions were taken to limit priming. For example participants were not
aware of the purpose of the study which was presented as a ‘Wildness Quiz’.
Although single item measures were used to enhance the accessibility of the campaign, the
sustained increase across all four measures gives confidence in the results. The replicated medi-
ation analysis showing a consistent relationship between happiness, health and connection to
nature also provides further confidence in the findings. Further, the single-item measures used
have good validity and reliability, with a similar approach used in official surveys of population
well-being [42]. Finally, health, well-being and nature connection may have some seasonal var-
iation, but without intervention such measures are known to be relatively stable. For example,
in the UK, ONS statistics [42] show that happiness remains constant May through to October
with any variation in late Autumn and early Spring being of small magnitudes (e.g. approxi-
mately 1%), compared to 6% after participating in 30 Days Wild.
A repeated measures time-series design is a proven approach in evaluations of such scale
and type [38], and key criteria were met in this case [37]. RCT would provide the best evidence
in future research, but a sequence of evaluations of growing complexity, carried out on the
basis of earlier, more straightforward work is recommended [54,38] and this should include
economic significance [9]. In the current study, the sustained increases over two-months, effect
size and mediation analysis give confidence an intervention effect [39] was achieved, providing
a basis for more robust measures and designs. Such promising results provide motivation and
justification for extended evaluations of future campaigns.
A further limitation was gender imbalance in the (self-selecting) participants, the vast
majority of whom were female. There is a need for further research to establish the reasons for
the gender difference and an investigation of approaches that would engage men more success-
fully. Although complex, the evaluation of future campaigns could endeavour to record the
actual activities users participated in. Bringing the activities used during participation into the
analysis would allow examination of their appeal to each gender, and also of their relationship
to the outcomes. The most effective activities could then be identified and promoted.
Effectiveness returns us to the rationale. The need to address global issues like declining bio-
diversity and the need for healthy lifestyles that reduce demands on our health services can
both benefit from increasing people’s connection to nature. Such grand challenges require
large-scale upstream interventions. 30 Days Wild provides good evidence that progress can be
made through partnerships with the environmental sector that use nature as a new paradigm
for well-being [10]. By asking people to make room in their lives for nature, every day, for
thirty days and to share their experience through social media, interventions can produce sus-
tained increases in connection to nature, happiness, health, and pro-nature behaviours. This
suggests there is the potential to apply 30 Days Wild to millions of people within schools, work-
places and local neighbourhoods each year, so that they and the natural world can enjoy the
ensuing benefits.
