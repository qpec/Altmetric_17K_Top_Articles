Demographic and practice factors predicting repeated 
non-attendance in primary care: a national retrospective 
cohort analysis
David A Ellis*, Ross McQueenie*, Alex McConnachie, Philip Wilson, Andrea E Williamson
Summary
Background Addressing the causes of low engagement in health care is a prerequisite for reducing health inequalities. 
People who miss multiple appointments are an under-researched group who might have substantial unmet health 
needs. Individual-level patterns of missed general practice appointments might thus provide a risk marker for 
vulnerability and poor health outcomes. We sought to ascertain the contributions of patient and practice factors to the 
likelihood of missing general practice appointments.
Methods For this national retrospective cohort analysis, we extracted UK National Health Service general practice data 
that were routinely collected across Scotland between Sept 5, 2013, and Sept 5, 2016. We calculated the per-patient 
number of missed appointments from individual appointments and investigated the risk of missing a general practice 
appointment using a negative binomial model offset by number of appointments made. We then analysed the effect 
of patient-level factors (including age, sex, and socioeconomic status) and practice-level factors (including appointment 
availability and geographical location) on the risk of missing appointments.
Findings The full dataset included information from 909 073 patients, of whom 550 083 were included in the analysis 
after processing. We observed that 104 461 (19·0%) patients missed more than two appointments in the 3 year study 
period. After controlling for the number of appointments made, patterns of non-attendance could be differentiated, 
with patients who were aged 16–30 years (relative risk ratio [RRR] 1·21, 95% CI 1·19–1·23) or older than 90 years 
(2·20, 2·09–2·29), and of low socioeconomic status (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation decile 1: RRR 2·27, 
2·22–2·31) significantly more likely to miss multiple appointments. Men missed fewer appointments overall than 
women, but were somewhat more likely to miss appointments in the adjusted model (1·05, 1·04–1·06). Practice 
factors also substantially affected attendance patterns, with urban practices in affluent areas that typically have 
appointment waiting times of 2–3 days the most likely to have patients who serially miss appointments. The 
combination of both patient and practice factors to predict appointments missed gave a higher pseudo R² value (0·66) 
than models using either group of factors separately (patients only R²=0·54; practice only R²=0·63).
Interpretation The findings that both patient and practice characteristics contribute to non-attendance of general 
practice appointments raise important questions for both the management of patients who miss multiple 
appointments and the effectiveness of existing strategies that aim to increase attendance. Addressing these issues 
should lead to improvements in provision of services and public health.

Introduction
Missed appointments have obvious financial implications 
for health-care systems around the world, but their 
prevalence and health impact also need to be understood 
to develop effective interventions to increase patient 
engagement and to help health services contribute 
towards tackling health inequalities.1–3 Missing multiple 
medical appointments could be seen as a manifestation 
of poor engagement,3 and missed appointments for 
preventive care might have a substantial public health 
impact. Previous research has focused on single 
instances of non-attendance rather than on patients who 
miss multiple appointments. These episode-based 
designs analysed missed appointments across an entire 
patient population rather than at an individual patient 
level. Factors reported to be associated with missing a 
single appointment include age, sex, transport logistics, 
and clinic or practitioner factors such as booking 
efficiency and the rapport between staff and patients.4–9 
Whether these factors are also associated with patients 
who do not attend multiple appointments remains 
unclear.10 At present, little agreement exists on what 
works in practice to reduce missed appointments.11
Information about patients who miss multiple 
appointments is limited. Preliminary research did confirm 
that a small core group of patients who miss multiple 
appointments was likely to exist, with the odds of missing 
a subsequent appointment increasing among patients

who had missed at least one appointment in the previous 
12 months.5 A larger audit of National Health Service 
(NHS) England hospital outpatient (secondary care) 
appointments concluded that one in 50 patients (65 590 of 
3·5 million) who missed one appointment went on to 
miss three or more further appointments within 
3 months.12 These numbers suggest that this effect is likely 
to have significant implications for patients, practitioners, 
and service managers. Findings from a 2017 focus group 
analysis of general practitioners showed that clinicians 
make clear distinctions between patients who miss a few 
appointments and those who miss many.10 Patients who 
miss multiple general practice appointments are 
postulated to differ from the general population and are 
more likely to have complex social and health needs.10,13
This research seeks to investigate these issues empirically 
by studying individual patient attendance patterns. This 
will establish the validity of previous clinical evidence 
suggesting that patients who serially miss appointments 
are likely to have very poor health, be socially disadvantaged, 
and remain high users of unscheduled care compared 
with patients who occasionally miss appointments;3,10,14 if 
confirmed, the pattern of missed appointments for 
preventive care could amplify health inequalities. This 
research will also act as a first step towards developing 
future interventions for health-care systems to reduce 
levels of serial non-attendance and increase patient 
engagement. This study focuses on the patient 
demographic and practice factors that predict serial missed 
appointments in general practice. We hypothesise that 
both of these factors influence an individual’s likelihood of 
attending general practice appointments.
Methods
Study design
For this national retrospective cohort analysis, we 
extracted NHS general practice data that were routinely 
collected across Scotland between Sept 5, 2013, and 
Sept 5, 2016. Albasoft provided the dataset, which we 
retrieved using the EScro system, software designed to 
assess performance against NHS service-level agree-
ments. However, EScro also integrates data held in 
disparate clinical systems, which can then be provided to 
researchers via safe transfer. General practices were

Research in context 
Evidence before this study
We searched MEDLINE and PubMed for studies published in 
English between Jan 1, 1950, and May 1, 2017, using keywords 
“missed appointment” and “primary care”. This search included 
MeSH terms for both sets of keywords. Previous studies 
examined single missed appointments in primary-care and 
secondary-care settings in patients with index conditions such 
as diabetes and HIV. Several studies also analysed interventions 
to reduce missed appointments such as text reminders. Two 
studies, one published in 2016 and the other in 2008, 
suggested appointment wait time might contribute to the 
likelihood of attending appointments. Clinicians in the UK 
report that some patients who repeatedly miss appointments 
are socially vulnerable and have poor health; a topic, which, 
until now, has not previously been researched.
Added value of this study
 This 3 year retrospective cohort study examines more than 
13 million appointments from more than 100 general practices 
across Scotland, representing 11 of 14 health boards and a 
tenth of all practices in Scotland. This study is the first to 
provide empirical evidence that an important minority of 
patients have a pattern of missing multiple general practice 
appointments. The study uses patient-level data to investigate 
which patient and practice characteristics can indicate increased 
risks for repeatedly missing appointments. Patient and practice 
factors remain important, with people of low socioeconomic 
status and aged 16–30 years or older than 90 years being 
significantly more likely to miss multiple appointments. Urban 
practices in more affluent areas that predominantly offer 
appointments with a delay of 2–3 days are most likely to have 
registered patients who miss multiple appointments. These 
results might point to some recommendations on how health-
care systems can effectively manage these patients and 
maximise attendance; for example, practices might consider 
increasing access to on-the-day appointments for patients who 
are already at high risk of becoming serial non-attenders.
Implications of all the available evidence
This study highlights the important effect in a UK setting of 
high socioeconomic deprivation on a person’s ability to engage 
with general practice care, and the relative contributions of sex 
and age. In public health terms, these factors are likely to be 
particularly important for consultations involving preventive 
health care. General practice-level factors such as appointment 
delay contribute to missed appointments, and practices seeking 
to increase engagement in care could selectively offer same day 
appointments to patients at risk of not managing to attend. 
Practices whose patient populations are socioeconomically 
mixed or predominantly affluent should pay particular 
attention to this study’s findings because patients from 
socioeconomically deprived backgrounds receiving care in these 
settings are at particularly high risk of low engagement in care. 
Our findings apply to the UK but are probably generalisable 
across other health-care settings. Future research will report on 
diagnoses, outcomes, social vulnerability, and health-care 
utilisation across the primary-care and secondary-care interface 
to allow further characterisation of patients, understanding of 
service provision, and development of appropriate 
interventions. Increasing engagement of disadvantaged 
populations with preventive health-care services could make an 
important contribution to the reduction of health inequalities.

recruited to the study following written request to each 
practice 
detailing 
the 
project. 
Participation 
was 
specifically on an opt-in basis. Therefore all health boards 
in Scotland were requested to participate. Practices from 
11 health boards agreed to take part. We did not do any 
sampling 
to 
ensure 
proportional 
representation, 
including in the study all practices that agreed to take 
part. We also invited deep-end practices (the 100 practices 
operating in the most deprived areas of Scotland) to take 
part. 21 of the 100 asked agreed to take part.
NHS general practice has almost universal coverage of 
the UK population. Patients are registered with one 
general practice, meaning a targeted sample of general 
practices can achieve population representation. More-
over, unlike most other parts of the UK NHS such as 
specialist hospital care, in which general practitioners or 
other clinicians gatekeep access to services via referral, a 
patient can schedule an appointment with the general 
practice team at their discretion. General practice 
appointments therefore provide a starting point when 
seeking to understanding serial non-attendance in the 
context of engagement in care.3
The data contained within this study did not require 
ethical approval due to it being regarded as a service 
evaluation. We obtained a letter of comfort from the West 
of Scotland NHS Ethics Committee and the University of 
Glasgow, College of Medical, Veterinary & Life Sciences 
Ethics Committee confirming that the full study did not 
need health service ethics permissions. We aggregated 
data where necessary to ensure individual patient privacy.
Due to the sensitive nature of NHS administrative 
data, the datasets generated or analysed during the 
present study will not be publicly available. Data have 
been made available only to the research team under 
controlled access and strictly for the purposes of this 
research study. Summary data, at the level of disclosure

Outcomes
Our primary analysis aimed to understand what 
proportion of patients miss multiple primary-care 
appointments. Our secondary analysis investigated 
whether patients who miss multiple appointments can 
be differentiated from patients who miss a few on the 
basis of their age, sex, socioeconomic status, or practice-
level factors (appendix).
Data analysis
Patient data included age, sex, socioeconomic status 
(measured using Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 
[SIMD]),15 and distance by road to the patient’s registered 
medical practice. SIMD incorporates data collected by 
the Scottish Government on income, employment, 
education, health, access to services, crime, and housing 
to index areas from least deprived (SIMD10) to most 
deprived (SIMD1). Ethnicity was excluded from this 
analysis post hoc due to poor recording;16 only 2·69% of 
appointments could be associated with ethnicity data in 
the medical records due to low levels of recording by 
practices. Ethnicity was predominantly recorded in the 
small number of cases for which it seemed relevant to 
diagnosis.
Practice data included SIMD score for each practice 
based on a mean for all registered patients, time between 
an appointment being made by a patient and 
subsequently attended or missed (appointment delay), 
total number of appointments allocated by a practice 
divided by list size (number of appointments per 
patient), the total time available for all appointments 
divided by the total number of patients (median 
appointment time per patient), and the urban/rural 
classification score for each practice, which ranges 
from 1 to 8, with 8 being most remote or rural (appendix).
Using analysis criteria from the pilot study,10 we 
allocated patients into the following groups: zero missed 
appointments (none missed per year over the 3 year

Data are n (%). Missed appointment groupings are based on age and annual rate of non-attendance: zero is no 
appointments missed over the 3 year period; low is less than one appointment missed on average per year over the 
3 year period; medium is one to two appointments missed on average per year over the 3 year period; and high is more 
than two appointments missed on average per year over the 3 year period. p<0·01 for all variables measured.

(less 
than 
one

on 
average per year over the 3 year period); medium missed 
appointments (one to two missed on average per year 
over the 3 year period); and high missed appointments 
(more than two missed on average per year over the 
3 year period).
We calculated missed appointments on a per-year basis 
for each of the years within our 3 year study period. We 
calculated the mean missed appointment rate over 3 years 
to take account of varying appointment scheduling activity 
by illness episodes and social crises.17 Furthermore, we 
report the relative contribution of patient and practice 
factors, both individually and collectively, to the variance in 
frequency of missed appointments.8,10
Data were cleaned to ensure that each appointment was 
logged as attended or missed (did not attend). This was 
primarily based on the “in” and “out” time recorded for 
that appointment. If this was recorded as “0” then the 
appointment was classified as did not attend. Appointments 
regarded as non-face-to-face consul 
tations were removed. 
These were defined in our dataset as “Administrator”, 
“Receptionist”, “Secretary”, “Other Admin and Clerical”, 
“Practice Manager”, and “Unknown”. In our original 
protocol design, we intended to analyse only appointments 
marked as general practice, but the recording of 
appointment specificity at this level was poor. Removal of 
all non-general practice-marked data left only 24% of all 
records available for analysis and therefore we included all 
appointments for a primary health-care professional except 
those removed after applying the other exclusion criteria. 
Any patients with a blank registration date were also 
removed along with those who were not registered as 
patients with the practice in the study period. Finally, 
appointments for which the waiting time was less than 
0 (negative) and those that lasted less than 2 min were 
removed (appendix). We derived the 2 min distinction 
from the pilot study.10
We calculated the total number of appointments 
scheduled during the 3 year period for each patient in 
addition to their annual rate of non-attendance and 
number and percentage of appointments missed. We 
classified patients on the basis of their mean annual rate of 
non-attendance over 3 years (never, low, medium, or high). 
We created a data file containing the appointment history 
of each patient and merged it with individual anonymised 
patient information.
We first analysed demographic factors using cross 
tabulation to examine age, sex, and socioeconomic status 
(SIMD). Following this, we used a negative binomial 
regression 
model 
to 
measure 
risk 
of 
missing 
appointments, adjusting for patient and practice factors: 
age, sex, socioeconomic status (SIMD), distance between 
home and the practice, appointment delay, mean 
appointment time per patient, number of appointments 
per patient, rurality index, and mean practice 
socioeconomic status (SIMD). Additionally, the model 
was offset by number of appointments made per patient

to account for variations in appointment scheduling.17 
We excluded from the analysis any records that contained 
missing data for any patient or practice factors used in 
the regression model. We chose the negative binomial 
model because the variance in the number of missed 
appointments (33·83) was greater than the mean 
number of missed appointments (2·03). All statistical 
analyses were done in R software (version 3.4.0).

Results
155 practices were recruited initially; however, 19 were 
excluded from the present analysis: one practice closed, 
two practices merged since the study commenced, and 
16 had current issues with appointment data extraction 
due to NHS software updates. The full dataset included 
information from 909 073 patients. 358 990 (39·5%) 
patients who did not fit our inclusion criteria (appendix) 
were removed, leaving 550 083 patients in our analysis. 
A 3 year appointment history for each patient was 
uploaded to the NHS national secure safe haven 
(13 623 316 appointments). A total of 4 446 262 (32·6%) 
appointments were removed from our original dataset, 
leaving 9 177 054 appointments in our analysis. The mean 
age of included patients was 45 years (IQR 25–61), and 
260 714 (47·4%) were men and 289 369 (56·2%) were 
women (table 1).
During the 3 year period, 297 002 (54·0%) of 
550 083 patients missed no appointments, 253 081 (46·0%) 
missed one or more appointments, and 104 461 (19·0%)

Practice factors include the SIMD score for each practice based on a mean from all 
patients registered in that practice, the duration between when an appointment 
is made by a patient and subsequently attended or missed (appointment delay), 
the total number of appointments allocated by a practice divided by list size 
(number of available appointments per patient), the total time of all 
appointments divided by the total number of patients (mean appointment 
length per patient), and the urban/rural classification score for each practice, 
which ranges from 1–8, with 8 being more rural. Practice SIMD derived from the 
mean of all patients’ SIMD within each practice. All p values were less than 0·001 
unless otherwise stated. SIMD=Scottish index of multiple deprivation.

missed more than two appointments (figure 1). 
1 648 421 (12·1%) of all 13 623 316 appointments were not 
attended. Of these, 1 498 414 (90·9%) were by patients 
who missed more than one appointment over the 3 year 
examination period.
The highest frequencies of medium or high missed 
appointment 
status 
were 
among 
patients 
aged 
76–90 years (12 102 [33·4%] of 36 219 patients) and 
patients older than 90 years (1402 [48·0%] of 2922; 
table 1). Female patients in in each of the non-zero 
missed appointment categories showed more missed 
appointments than male patients, with 147 440 (51·0%) of 
289 369 women shown as non-missers compared with 
149 562 (57·4%) of 260 714 men. The results also showed 
an association between socioeconomic status and 
frequency of missed appointments, with the impact of 
increasing socio 
economic deprivation being apparent for 
all missed appointment categories. Collectively, in our 
unadjusted cross tabulation models, these results suggest 
that patients who miss multiple appointments are 
substan 
tially more likely to be older, female, and have 
low socioeconomic status.
We did regressions using a negative binomial 
distribution to model discrete counts of non-attendance 
in patients across the four appointment groups. Patients 
who are the most deprived (SIMD 1) are most likely to 
miss appointments (relative risk ratio [RRR] 2·27, 95% CI 
2·22–2·31; figure 2, table 2). Men are more likely to miss 
multiple appointments than women, but only when this 
is offset to account for the proportion of appointments 
made (1·05, 1·04–1·06), accounting for the change in 
effects seen between the regression modelling and the 
descriptive statistics shown in table 1. Patients aged 
16–30 years (1·21, 1·19–1·23) and patients older than 
90 years (2·20, 2·09–2·29) are more likely to miss 
multiple appointments than the reference group 
(patients aged 0–15 years).
Practice factors also contribute significantly to the 
likelihood of patients missing multiple appointments 
(figure 3, table 2). Practices with appointment delays of 
2–3 days were at highest risk (RRR 2·54, 95% CI 
2·46–2·62) of having more missed appointments when 
compared with on-the-day appointments. This risk is 
reduced with appointment delays extending beyond 
3 days. Urban practices were also more likely to face a 
higher risk of missed appointments, with a reduction as 
practices become more rural. Finally, practices with a 
higher mean patient SIMD (less socioeconomically 
deprived) showed an increased risk of containing patients 
who missed multiple appointments. Although median 
appointment time available per patient over 3 years did 
not affect risk of missing appointments (170·78 min 
[IQR 54·97]), the median number of appointments per 
patient offered over 3 years had a small effect on risk of 
missing appointments (21·8 appointments [IQR 6·03]; 
RRR 1·08 [95% CI 1·08–1·08]).
However, these patient and practice factors can be 
compared both individually and additively using a 
measure of pseudo R² (Cox-Snell). Comparing models 
consisting of patients and practices alone via this pseudo

R² model, we found that practice factors have a larger 
effect than patient factors with regard to the prediction of 
the number of appointments patients are likely to miss. 
However, a model combining both patient and practice 
factors to predict the number of appointments missed 
gave a higher pseudo R² value (0·66) than models using 
either group of factors separately (patients only R²=0·54; 
practice only R²=0·63; figure 4).
Discussion
In a large dataset, we have reported for the first time that 
non-attendance rates in primary care are partly driven 
by a significant number of patients missing multiple 
appointments. Nearly 20% of patients did not attend 
more than two appointments in the 3 year study period.
Clear differences exist between patients who miss no 
appointments, patients who miss a few, and patients who 
miss multiple appointments. Patients in the age groups 
16–30 years and older than 90 years are more likely to 
miss multiple appointments. Women use general practice 
services more often than men and are more likely to miss 
multiple appointments. However, when controlling for 
the number of appointments made, men miss a higher 
proportion of all appointments.5 Despite this, the most 
important patient-level factor to predict likelihood of 
serially missing general practice appointments remains 
high levels of socioeconomic deprivation. At a practice 
level, appointment delays of 2–3 days, practices offering a 
high number of appointments per patient, urban 
practices, and higher average practice SIMD were all 
factors driving increased risk of non-attendance.
The patterns recorded provide clear demographic 
evidence to support the concerns raised by clinicians that 
patients who serially miss appointments are likely to be 
socially disadvantaged.3 To make the most of primary care 
administrative data, predictions regarding specific 
patient’s attendance patterns can be maximised when 
combined with patient and practice characteristics. This 
analysis was aided by the number of patient records in 
our dataset. The retrospective cohort study design has 
allowed us to include patients who might be otherwise 
challenging to recruit. In view of the size and represen-
tative nature of our sample, proportions, as recorded in 
our analysis, are likely to be consistent across Scotland 
and generalisable to the UK NHS primary care system. 
This finding is relevant globally for other primary-care-
focused health systems that are comprehensively 
delivered free at the point of care.18
Ethnicity, a potential factor in ability to attend 
appointments, was poorly recorded by practices and 
therefore could not be analysed. Similarly, appointment 
allocation to general practitioners, nurses, or other health-
care providers could have an effect on likelihood to miss 
appointments, but we were unable to study these effects 
because of inconsistent recording by practices. Because of 
limitations driven by data confidentiality, we were unable 
to measure continuity of care with specific general 
practitioners in this dataset. Patients might attend other 
health-care services, such as accident and emergency 
departments, in place of attending general practice 
appointments. This alternate attendance might account 
for a proportion of patients’ non-attendance at general 
practice 
appointments. 
Future 
research 
analysing 
patients’ health-care use along with secondary-care 
linkage data is planned to ascertain whether this 
hypothesis is correct.
With many patients regularly attending multiple 
appointments, these results give weight to the argument 
that, for health service-focused activity on tackling health 
inequalities, future interventions in universal health-care 
systems need to take patients’ engagement patterns into 
account. Subsequent interventions are likely to become 
more successful if they are targeted, instead of adopting a 
one-size-fits-all approach.19
The effect of age is partly in line with previous research, 
which shows that younger adults are more likely to miss a 
higher proportion of appointments.11 The increased levels 
of non-attendance in patients older than 90 years was 
unexpected, although one previous study has shown 
transportation barriers are more likely to affect an older 
user’s 
ability 
to 
attend 
non-emergency 
medical 
treatment.20 An analysis of rates of recorded frailty and 
cognitive impairment is planned to further investigate 
the role that older age might have on appointment 
attendance patterns.
The increased risk that both elderly and socioeconomically 
deprived patients will miss multiple appointments is 
particularly important if these appointments would have 
included preventive activities such as screening or chronic 
disease monitoring. This pattern of non-attendance is 
likely to amplify health inequalities and thus deserves 
further attention.
Besides the factors mentioned, patients’ likelihood to 
attend appointments might be driven in part by the 
number of long-term multimorbidity conditions they 
have. The effect of these conditions on attendance is out 
of the scope of the present study, but we plan to examine 
this in future.
The practice at which a patient is registered has an 
important role in generating patterns of missed ap-
pointments, and practice policies regarding appointment 
scheduling might be a useful future inter 
vention 
target. Notably, practices where a high proportion of 
appointments are characterised by an interval of 2–3 days 
between booking and appointment time have high rates 
of serial non-attendance. Some of these appointment 
requests might be for new problems rather than for 
planned clinical review, and, in some cases, self-limiting 
symptoms will have resolved before the planned 
consultation time. Nevertheless, these delays could 
selectively disadvantage sick patients who are less able to 
negotiate earlier appointments, with resulting adverse 
health effects and potential impacts on other emergency 
services.

There might be a case for some practices selectively 
offering on-the-day appointments for patients at high 
risk of serial non-attendance. Practices in more affluent 
areas seem to be more poorly equipped to accommodate 
patients who repeatedly miss multiple appointments 
than practices in more deprived areas and could benefit 
most from similar adaptations to their existing 
appointment systems. Practices with a higher proportion 
of socioeconomically deprived patients might already 
have adjusted services accordingly. This strategy was 
reported in our pilot study.10 Our results suggest that 
socioeconomically deprived patients living in more 
affluent areas might have particularly high levels of 
unmet health need in primary-care settings.
The effect of existing strategies to reduce any 
appointment non-attendance has been varied,19 and this 
might be partly due to the conflation of single-episode and 
serial-missed appointments in the available evidence until 
now. Our study’s conceptual framework is underpinned 
by a life-course approach to health: serial missed appoint-
ments are framed as a health-harming behaviour. Along 
with the rurality or urbanicity of a place of residence, 
higher socioeconomic deprivation is the strongest 
demographic predictor of serial missed appointments and 
therefore encourages further exploration. Ongoing 
analysis will investigate the role of adverse childhood 
experiences, other social vulnerabilities, and health 
diagnoses, including multimorbidity, on attendance 
patterns.21 This analysis will help inform further 
consideration of which interventions might be relevant 
(such as the use of text reminders). There is also scope to 
learn from interventions in health and other settings 
targeted at marginalised groups, such as the role of peer 
support or health navigators. Future research aims to 
further understand what distinguishes patients who miss 
multiple appointments from patients who do not, and will 
include health utilisation and engagement patterns across 
the wider health service, including unscheduled care 
using linked patient data from secondary care.10 This 
approach will extend our understanding of whether 
serially missing general practice appointments acts as a 
risk marker for social vulnerability and poorer health 
outcomes, and whether increased use of emergency 
services has an important economic impact.
This study focused on patient demographic and 
practice factors that describe whether patients are more 
likely to have patterns of missing general practice 
appointments. This evidence delineates a subgroup of 
patients who have a low engagement pattern within a 
universal, free-at-the-point-of-access, primary health-care 
system. The results of this study are important for both 
public health and health-care providers. We present 
evidence that both health-care system design and patient 
demographic factors drive low engagement in care. 
These findings should be taken into account in future 
development 
of 
universal 
and 
targeted 
health 
interventions in the UK and in other similar settings, 
and will make an important health service contribution 
towards tackling health inequalities.
