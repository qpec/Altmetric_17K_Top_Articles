SUMMARY
Identifying interventions that more effectively pro-
mote healthy growth of children with undernutrition
is a pressing global health goal. Analysis of human
milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) from 6-month-post-
partum mothers in two Malawian birth cohorts re-
vealed that sialylated HMOs are significantly less
abundant in those with severely stunted infants.
To explore this association, we colonized young
germ-free mice with a consortium of bacterial
strains cultured from the fecal microbiota of a
6-month-old stunted Malawian infant and fed recip-
ient animals a prototypic Malawian diet with or
without purified sialylated bovine milk oligosaccha-
rides (S-BMO). S-BMO produced a microbiota-
dependent augmentation of lean body mass gain,
changed bone morphology, and altered liver, mus-
cle, and brain metabolism in ways indicative of a
greater ability to utilize nutrients for anabolism.
These effects were also documented in gnotobiotic
piglets using the same consortium and Malawian
diet. These preclinical models indicate a causal, mi-
crobiota-dependent relationship between S-BMO
and growth promotion.
INTRODUCTION
The global burden of childhood undernutrition is great, causing
3.1 million deaths annually and accounting for 45% of all deaths
under five years of age in 2011 (Black et al., 2013). Stunting,
defined by a height-for-age Z score (HAZ) below two SDs from
the mean for a reference cohort of healthy children, is the
most prevalent form of undernutrition. Stunting is associated
with lifelong consequences beyond reduced height, including
impaired intellectual development (e.g., Victora et al., 2008).
The causes of stunting are believed to include environmental,
genetic, and epigenetic factors (Martorell and Zongrone, 2012).
Unfortunately, the effects of current interventions on growth, im-
mune function, and neurodevelopmental outcomes have been
modest (Dewey and Adu-Afarwuah, 2008). Recent culture-inde-
pendent studies have demonstrated that the normal pattern of
gut microbiota assembly is disrupted in children with undernutri-
tion, leading to the proposal that disrupted microbiota develop-
ment impairs healthy postnatal growth (Subramanian et al.,
2014).
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends exclusive
breastfeeding for 6 months (Kramer and Kakuma, 2012). Human
milk is composed of many bioactive substances, including a
diverse repertoire of human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs) that
may be decorated with fucose and/or sialic acid moieties (Coppa
et al., 2011; Smilowitz et al., 2014). HMOs are not absorbed in the
proximal gut (Engfer et al., 2000) and function as prebiotics for

 bacterial strains associated with numerous benefits (e.g.,
improved vaccine responses [Huda et al., 2014], enhanced gut
barrier function [Ewaschuk et al., 2008], and protection from en-
teropathogen infection [Fukuda et al., 2011]).
The relationship between HMOs and the growth phenotypes
of infants, particularly in populations where undernutrition is
pervasive, has not been well characterized. The current study
addresses this issue by first characterizing breast milk HMO
content in Malawian mothers whose 6-month-old infants either
exhibited healthy growth or were severely stunted. Differences
identified in their HMO profiles were then translated to preclinical
tests of whether one difference, involving sialylated HMOs,
was causally related to growth. Germ-free mice and newborn
piglets were colonized with a consortium of cultured bacterial
strains isolated from the fecal microbiota of a severely stunted
Malawian infant and fed a representative Malawian diet with or
without the addition of sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides
(S-BMO; structurally similar to sialylated HMO). The results
establish that this S-BMO preparation produces a microbiota-
dependent promotion of growth and metabolic changes indi-
cative of improved nutrient utilization in both host species.
They also illustrate a generalizable preclinical pathway for char-
acterizing the effects of diet-based interventions designed to
treat and/or prevent undernutrition and its co-morbidities in
infants.
RESULTS
Human Milk Oligosaccharide Content Correlates with
Growth in Malawian Infants
Breast milk samples were collected from Malawian mothers at
6 months postpartum as part of the Lungwena Child Nutrition
Intervention Study #5 (LCNI-5) (Mangani et al., 2015). Samples
were selected for HMO analysis from mothers whose children
exhibited either healthy growth (HAZ > 0; n = 29 mothers) or se-
vere stunting (HAZ < �3; n = 59). Liquid chromatography time-of-
flight mass spectrometry (LC-TOF MS) detected over 50 unique
oligosaccharide structures among the samples (Table S1A).
HMOs containing sialic acid and/or fucose residues represented
71.8% ± 1.5% (mean ± SEM) of total HMOs (Table S1A). Mothers
of healthy infants had significantly higher concentrations of total,
sialylated, and fucosylated HMOs than mothers of severely
stunted infants (Figure 1A). The most growth discriminatory
sialylated HMO for the entire sampled LCNI-5 cohort was
sialyllacto-N-tetraose b (LSTb), while the most discriminatory fu-
cosylated HMOs were 20-fucosyllactose (20FL) and lacto-N-fuco-
pentaose I (LNFP I) (Table S1A).
Mothers with a functional FUT2 gene produce a1-2-linked fu-
cosylated HMOs (‘‘secretor phenotype’’). As expected, the total
and fucosylated HMO content of breast milk samples collected
from secretor mothers in this cohort (n = 69) was significantly
higher than that of non-secretors (n = 19; p < 0.05, two-way
ANOVA) (Table S1A). Among non-secretor mothers, those
whose children were severely stunted had HMO profiles that
were significantly deficient in fucosylated and sialylated HMOs
compared to milk from mothers of healthy infants (Figure 1A).
The most discriminatory HMOs were sialyllacto-N-tetraose b,
as well as the sialylated 4021b species (Neu5Ac(a2-6)Gal(b1-4)
GlcNAc(b1-3)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-3)Gal(b1-4)Glc) (Table S1A).
Among secretor mothers, no significant differences in HMO
abundances were observed between those with healthy infants
and those with stunted infants (Table S1A). One interpretation
of these data is that some non-secretor Malawian mothers are
unable to compensate for deficiencies in fucosylated HMOs
through increased output of other (e.g., sialylated) HMOs, result-
ing in breast milk that is less supportive of healthy infant growth.
We extended our analysis of breast milk HMOs to mothers
enrolled in a second birth cohort study conducted in rural Malawi
(iLiNS-DYAD-M) (Ashorn et al., 2015). Breast milk samples
(n = 215) were selected for HMO analysis based on infant HAZ
scores at 6 months postpartum. Similar to LCNI-5 mothers, we
found that total and sialylated HMO content was significantly
elevated for mothers of healthy infants (HAZ > 0; n = 70)
compared to mothers of stunted infants (HAZ < �2; n = 145) (Fig-
ure 1B; Table S1B). Fucosylated HMO content was not signifi-
cantly enriched for mothers of healthy infants in the iLiNS-
DYAD-M cohort.
For this second cohort, we also observed that breast milk from
non-secretor mothers of healthy infants (n = 20) exhibited signif-
icantly higher levels of total, fucosylated, and sialylated HMOs
than milk of non-secretor mothers of stunted infants (n = 40) (Fig-
ure 1B). While secretor mothers’ milk displayed no significant
differences in total or fucosylated HMOs between infant anthro-
pometry bins (as observed with LCNI-5) (Table S1B), sialylated

 HMOs were significantly elevated in milk from mothers of healthy
infants (n = 50) compared to those with stunted infants (n = 105;
p < 0.01, Welch’s t test). These results from two independent
clinical studies in Malawi raised the possibility that HMOs play
an important role in infant growth.
Cultured Bacterial Strains from the Fecal Microbiota of a
Stunted Malawian Infant
We reasoned that the hypothesis that HMOs are causally related
to healthy growth could be tested preclinically in gnotobiotic
animals colonized with the gut microbiota of a stunted Malawian
infant and fed a Malawian diet with or without addition of bovine
milk oligosaccharides (BMOs) that have structural similarities to
HMOs (Aldredge et al., 2013).
Colonizing germ-free animals with a genome-sequenced bac-
terial culture collection, generated from the fecal microbiota of
an individual infant donor representing a human population of in-
terest, is valuable for a number of reasons. Members of the
collection represent the microbial exposures experienced by
the host, including inheritance of microbes from the mother,
and reflect selection placed on the microbiota by regional dietary
practices. Importantly, the culture collection in its entirety, or
subsets of the collection, can be utilized to define the contribu-

This is not possible when transplanting

communities.
With
these considerations in mind, we gener-
ated a collection of bacterial strains
from the fecal microbiota of a severely
stunted
6-month-old
Malawian
infant
(HAZ, �3.48; weight-for-height Z score,
0.05). The collection was composed of
25 distinct strains (strains defined as iso-
lates sharing R96% genome-wide nucle-
otide sequence similarity) (Table S2A).
Sequencing 16S rRNA gene amplicons
from the infant’s uncultured fecal micro-
biota revealed that 77.8% of the bacterial
composition detected in the intact com-
munity (97% ID OTUs, weighted by relative abundance) was rep-
resented in the culture collection (Figure 2A).
Mapping draft genomes to the Virulence Factor Database
(Chen et al., 2012) indicated that 16 strains possessed at
least one known or putative virulence factor, and eight had
more than three (Table S2B). The Salmonella enterica strain
possessed homologs to 170 of the 176 virulence factors
(96.6%) found in S. enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimu-
rium, a pathogen in both humans and mice. The sole Escherichia
coli strain contained two key virulence factors associated with
enteroaggregative E. coli: aggR and aap.
The genome content of bacterial isolates from an individual
can vary substantially from laboratory strains. Twenty-two of
the 25 strains shared >97% full-length 16S rRNA gene sequence
identity with their closest assignable reference type strain (Fig-
ure 2B). In contrast, only six isolates shared >90% overall
genome nucleotide sequence similarity, none had >93%, and
three shared <40% with the reference type strain (Figure 2B).
S-BMO Supplementation Improves Growth in Young
Gnotobiotic Mice
Since large-scale purification of HMOs from human milk is
not feasible, we purified a monosaccharide- and lactose-free
Cell 164, 859–871, February 25, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
861
 mixture of sialylated bovine milk oligosaccharides (S-BMO) from
a commercial cheese whey stream. 30- and 60-sialyllactose ac-
counted for 88% of the oligosaccharide content of S-BMO. The
remaining oligosaccharides were predominantly neutral trihexo-
ses of glucose, galactose, and N-acetyl-glucosamine/-galactos-
amine (�10.5%) and longer neutral oligosaccharides (1.5%)
(Table S3A).
Dietary information for Malawian infants during the transition
from exclusive breastfeeding to weaning allowed us to develop
a representative Malawian diet consisting of eight principal in-
gredients (M8). This diet does not satisfy the recommended daily
nutritional needs of humans or mice (Tables S3B and S3C).
Groups of young (5-week-old) male germ-free C57BL/6J mice
(n = 4–5/cage) were colonized with a single oral gavage of the
defined 25-strain community. Mice were fed M8 ± S-BMO (Fig-
ure 2C). A separate group of mice received M8 supplemented
with inulin (a heterogeneous mixture of fructose polymers similar
to fructo-oligosaccharides commonly added to infant formulas)
(Bode, 2012). S-BMO and inulin were added separately to M8
at a level corresponding to HMO abundance in mature mother’s
milk (Coppa et al., 2011). The supplemented diets were isocaloric
to M8 (Table S3C).
We applied shotgun sequencing of fecal DNA (community
profiling by sequencing [COPRO-seq]) to determine coloniza-
tion efficiency at strain-level resolution (McNulty et al., 2011).
Colonization was defined as a strain achieving >0.1% mean rela-
tive abundance in at least one diet treatment group 44 days
following gavage. Nineteen of the 25 strains (76%) colonized
recipient gnotobiotic mice (Table S4A). Those that failed to colo-
nize included both strains of Bifidobacterium longum subsp.
infantis, Klebsiella varicola, Peptoniphlius harei, and one strain
each of Enterococcus faecalis and Olsenella uli. The strains
that successfully colonized mice represent 10/11 (91%) of the
bacterial genera and all four bacterial phyla that constitute the
25-member-defined community. Colonization was highly repro-
ducible among replicate animals within and across treatment
groups (Figures S1A and S1B; Table S4A).
Body weight and composition was monitored over a 5-week
period, the latter by quantitative magnetic resonance (qMR).
Weight gain was significantly increased by S-BMO but not by
inulin supplementation (Figure 3A). Lean body mass gain was
also significantly increased by S-BMO (Figure 3B), while no sig-
nificant differences in fat mass gain were observed (data not
shown). These results were documented in two independent
gnotobiotic mouse experiments. The observed differences in
weight and lean body mass gain were not attributable to differ-
ences in food consumption, which was not significantly different
between treatment groups (2.17 ± 0.44 g/mouse/day [mean ±
SD] versus 2.92 ± 0.33 g/mouse/day for control and S-BMO-
treated animals, respectively; p = 0.08, Student’s t test).
S-BMO-associated growth promotion was also microbiota-
dependent; it was not observed in germ-free animals (Figure 3C).
A previous study of germ-free and conventionally raised mice
indicated that the microbiota affects bone mass (Sjo
¨ gren et al.,
2012). Microcomputed tomography (mCT) of femurs revealed
that, compared to controls consuming the M8 diet alone,
S-BMO supplementation was associated with significant in-
creases in cortical thickness, cortical volumetric bone mineral
density (vBMD), and cortical bone volume normalized to tissue
volume (BV/TV) (Figure 3D; Table S5). Histological analysis of
femurs also disclosed significantly increased BV/TV in the
trabecular region in mice consuming the S-BMO-supplemented
diet (Figures 3D and 3E). No significant difference was observed
in osteoclast number normalized to bone surface area (data
not shown), indicating that these effects were not due to fewer
osteoclasts resorbing bone. Mechanical loading is associated
with a reduced medullary area in the cortical region of femur
(Kodama et al., 1999). However, we observed no significant
difference in cortical medullary area in the femurs of S-BMO-
supplemented mice compared to controls (Table S5). This
observation suggests that the increased BV/TV and vBMD asso-
ciated with S-BMO treatment are not simply due to increased
body weight.
Members of the Distal Gut Microbiota Respond
Transcriptionally to S-BMO In Vivo
S-BMO treatment did not produce a robust change in the relative
abundance of any community member over the course of the
experiment other than E. coli (Table S4D). This strain exhibited
a significantly greater relative abundance in S-BMO-treated
animals but only during the first 16 days following initial coloniza-
tion (Figure 4A).
We identified bacterial strains that responded transcriptionally
to S-BMO supplementation by sequencing RNA isolated from
the animals’ cecal contents (10.8 ± 1.5 million reads/sample).
After correction for multiple hypotheses (a = 0.1), S-BMO did
not produce statistically significant changes in gene expression
in any of the three Bifidobacterium strains (B. catenulatum,
B. breve, and B. bifidum) that colonized recipient gnotobiotic
mice. In addition, no genes in the S. enterica strain were differen-
tially expressed with S-BMO supplementation. To rule out the
possibility that the effects of S-BMO were attributable to this en-
teropathogen, groups of 5-week old male germ-free animals
were colonized with the culture collection, with or without
S. enterica. Its removal had no significant effect on body weight
or lean body mass gain (data not shown).
The two organisms that exhibited the greatest transcriptional
response to S-BMO were E. coli and Bacteroides fragilis (Fig-
ure 4B). A total of 111 E. coli genes were differentially expressed
(p < 0.1, negative binomial test after Benjamini-Hochberg
correction), with 110 exhibiting greater representation in the
cecal meta-transcriptome of S-BMO-treated animals (Table
S6). These responses represented increased gene expression,
rather than increased abundance; at the time of sacrifice, there
was no significant difference in this strain’s relative abundance
in cecal contents between groups, as determined by 16S rRNA
sequencing and COPRO-seq (Figure 4A; Table S4A). KEGG
annotation of the set of differentially expressed E. coli genes re-
vealed that components of several pathways involved in central
energy metabolism were upregulated by S-BMO, including
those involved in the TCA cycle, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, py-
ruvate metabolism, galactose metabolism, purine and pyrimi-
dine metabolism, and aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (Figure 4C).
Although this strain contains homologs of two key virulence fac-
tors associated with enteroaggregative E. coli (Table S2B),
neither had detectable levels of expression in either diet context.

Cell 164, 859–871, February 25, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 E. coli is not known to be a direct consumer of HMOs. We hy-
pothesized that its response to S-BMO reflects membership in
a bacterial food web, where primary consumers catabolize
S-BMO and E. coli benefits secondarily. Members of the genus
Bacteroides harbor arsenals of polysaccharide utilization loci
(PULs), which function to import and metabolize dietary and
host glycans. PULs are minimally defined by an adjacent pair of
genes homologous to two B. thetaiotaomicron starch utilization
system (Sus) genes: susC and susD. Two species of Bacteroides,
B. fragilis and B. ovatus, were represented in the Malawian infant
community that colonized recipient gnotobiotic mice. While no
differences in PUL expression were documented in B. ovatus,
several B. fragilis PULs exhibited differential expression with
S-BMO supplementation. One upregulated PUL contains susC

Cross-Feeding between B. fragilis
and E. coli
These findings suggested that B. fragilis is
a primary consumer of S-BMO, involved
in a food web where E. coli acts as a sec-
ondary consumer. To test this notion, we
incubated B. fragilis or E. coli in PBS con-
taining S-BMO and assayed the superna-
tants for sialyllactose and sialic acid using
ultra high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrom-
etry (UPLC-MS). This analysis confirmed that B. fragilis degraded
sialyllactose, producing a concomitant increase in free sialic
acid. In contrast, E. coli did not significantly alter the concentra-
tion of either compound under these conditions (Figure 4E).
We next determined whether the products of S-BMO degra-
dation by B. fragilis could support the growth of E. coli. S-BMO
was incubated with B. fragilis. Subsequent growth of E. coli
was robust in minimal medium containing the B. fragilis-condi-
tioned S-BMO as the sole carbon source but minimal with un-
conditioned S-BMO (Figure 4F). Growth in medium containing
conditioned S-BMO was also significantly increased compared
to controls with sialic acid added as the sole carbon source (Fig-
ure 4F), even though E. coli degraded sialic acid (28.0% ± 4.2%

 decrease [mean ± SD] compared to uninoculated controls, p <
0.01, Student’s t test). These results suggest that lactose, or its
constituent monomers, glucose and galactose, are the primary
substrates used by E. coli under these conditions.
These observations raised the possibility that the microbiota-
dependent growth promotion observed in vivo with S-BMO sup-
plementation could be attributed either directly to primary
consumers of S-BMO (e.g., B. fragilis) or indirectly to secondary
consumers (e.g., E. coli).
We assessed the ability of S-BMO to promote growth of
5-week-old male gnotobiotic mice colonized with only the
B. fragilis and E. coli strains. S-BMO did not produce a significant

 difference in growth of these mice over a 5-week period
compared to M8 controls (Figure 4G). We concluded that (1)
colonization of the gut per se is not sufficient to produce the
S-BMO-enhancement of growth, and (2) other members of the
community and/or higher-order interactions between B. fragilis,
E. coli and these other members are required to mediate this
growth promotion.
S-BMO Supplementation Modulates Metabolism in Host
Tissues
We used targeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to measure the
levels of a panel of 176 metabolites (Newgard et al., 2009) in liver,
serum, muscle, and brain obtained from S-BMO-supplemented
versus M8 control mice 5 weeks after initial gavage of the 25-
member bacterial culture collection. We observed significantly
lower levels of medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines in the
sera of non-fasted, S-BMO-treated animals compared to con-
trols (Figure 5A); this observation was mirrored by decreases in
11 medium- and long-chain acylcarnitines and five fatty acyl
CoAs in their livers (Figure S2A; Table S7A). The decreased levels
of fatty acid metabolites in the liver and serum of these non-
fasted mice could reflect a more normalized anabolic state.
Accordingly, we documented that these animals had signifi-
cantly elevated concentrations of serum insulin, leptin, and tri-
glycerides (Figures S2B–S2D). We also noted a trend of higher
serum non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) (0.75 ± 0.14 mM
[mean ± SD] versus 0.59 ± 0.06 mM for S-BMO-supplemented
and control animals, respectively [p = 0.1, Student’s t test]).
Low serum leptin levels were a major predictor of childhood mor-
tality in a cohort of undernourished Ugandan children (Bartz
et al., 2014), and leptin levels correlate with bone mineral density
in women (Thomas et al., 2001).
These observations suggest that S-BMO-supplemented mice
more effectively utilize dietary components for anabolism. To
test the corollary that S-BMO-treated animals are better equip-
ped to mobilize nutrients during periods of fasting, we measured
metabolites in the livers and sera of mice that had been fed M8
with or without S-BMO (or inulin) and then euthanized following
an 8-hr fast. The concentrations of medium- and long-chain acyl-
carnitines (notably C18, C18:1, and C18:2) were elevated in the
sera of fasted, S-BMO-treated animals compared to M8 controls
(Figure 5A; Table S7B). In addition, concentrations of 15 acylcar-
nitine and 29 long-chain fatty acyl CoA species were significantly
higher in the livers of S-BMO-treated animals (Figure 5B; Table
S7B). Similar changes were not seen in mice consuming M8 +
inulin. In aggregate, our findings demonstrate a greater incre-
ment of lipid-derived metabolite concentrations in S-BMO-
treated mice between the fed and fasted states than in mice
fed an unsupplemented diet. This pattern is consistent with
more efficient switching from anabolic storage of fat in the fed
state to its oxidation in the fasted state, or increased metabolic
flexibility (Muoio 2014).
No statistically significant differences were observed in cecal
concentrations of organic acids or amino acids between fasted
S-BMO-treated and control animals (Table S7B). We broadened
our search for metabolic biomarkers associated with S-BMO-
sponsored growth by performing non-targeted GC/MS analysis
(Scholtens et al., 2014) of serum samples obtained at time of
euthanasia from fasted mice. Orthogonal projection to latent
structures discriminatory analysis (O-PLS-DA) revealed that the
metabolic profile of S-BMO-treated mice clustered distinctly
from that of M8 controls (Figure 5C, inset); e.g., a branched-chain
aminoacid(BCAA)metabolite,2-ketovaline,andaproductoffatty
acid oxidation, b-hydroxybutyrate, were associated with and
increased by S-BMO in fasted mice (Figure 5C; Table S7D). The
increase in b-hydroxybutyrate in fasted S-BMO-supplemented
mice supports our interpretation that increased fatty acid oxida-
tion underlies the increased levels of fatty acid-derived acyl CoA
and acylcarnitine species in liver and serum of these animals.
The increase in a BCAA-derived metabolite also suggests that
amino acids are being utilized as energy substrates in the fasted
state. BCAA are also known to promote muscle protein synthesis
by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (Newgard et al.,
2009). This is notable given the significant augmentation in gain
of lean body mass observed with S-BMO treatment (Figure 3B).
In addition to stunted growth, childhood undernutrition results
in persistent deficits in cognitive development (Victora et al.,
2008). Sialic acids, a group of compounds derived from neura-
minic acid, including the nine-carbon monosaccharide N-acetyl-
neuraminic
acid
(NeuAc),
are
integral
to
postnatal
brain
development; NeuAc is a component of gangliosides and is
covalently linked to neural cell adhesion molecules (NCAMs)
that mediate cell-cell interactions involved in synaptogenesis
and memory (Wang and Brand-Miller, 2003). Dietary supplemen-
tation with sialylated glycoproteins has been shown to increase
polysialylation of NCAM and improve memory (Wang et al.,
2007a). Nontargeted UPLC/MS revealed that the metabolic pro-
file in the brains of S-BMO-treated mice was distinct from that of
control animals (Figure S3A, inset; Table S7E). Interestingly, we
compared the m/z feature that was most discriminatory for
S-BMO-treated animals (mass 346.0546 Da; Figure S3A) to the
human metabolome database (Wishart et al., 2013) and found
that the compound closest in mass was an adduct of NeuAc
(M + K � 2H; 346.054587 Da). Applying targeted GC/MS to the
same brain samples also revealed distinct metabolic profiles.
Free NeuAc, inosine, and adenosine were among eight metabo-
lites identified as significantly elevated in the brains of S-BMO-
treated mice (Figures S3B and S3C; Table S7F). Inosine
treatment promotes axonal rewiring and improves behavior in
animal models of traumatic brain injury (Chen et al., 2002; Dachir
et al., 2014), while adenosine has both neuromodulatory and
neuroprotective functions in the brain (Fredholm et al., 2005).
S-BMO Supplementation Promotes Growth in
Gnotobiotic Piglets
We next examined whether the observed effects of S-BMO sup-
plementation on growth and metabolism in mice also occurred in
a second mammalian species. We selected gnotobiotic piglets
because the digestive physiology of swine is similar to that of hu-
mans (Miller and Ullrey, 1987). Since newborn piglets exhibit
impaired gut barrier function (Wijtten et al., 2011), we excluded
the eight members of the defined community with three or
more homologs to known virulence factors in their genomes,
including E. coli (Table S2). A group of six germ-free domestic
piglets was colonized at 3 days of age with the remaining

 17-strain consortium (see Table S2A) and weaned onto the M8
diet over the next 7 days. At day 13 of postnatal life (day of
birth defined as experimental day 1), piglets were split into con-
trol and experimental groups (n = 3 piglets/group). For 6 days,
piglets in the experimental group were fed M8 + S-BMO while
control animals were fed the M8 diet alone (see Figure 6A for
the experimental design; weight data were collected on days
14 through 18).
COPRO-seq analysis of fecal samples revealed that coloniza-
tion was efficient, with 14/17 (82%) of input strains detected in

 the piglets’ fecal microbiota at >0.1% relative abundance (Table
S4B). The failure of three human-derived strains (Peptoniphilus
harei and both strains of Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis)
to colonize germ-free piglets in addition to germ-free mice could
reflect a number of factors including their inability to thrive in the
M8 diet context or restricted host specificity. As observed in
mice, microbiota structure was similar between S-BMO-supple-
mented and control animals (Figures S1C and S1D; Table S4E).
Piglets receiving the S-BMO-supplemented M8 diet displayed
significantly greater body weight gain compared to controls
(Figure 6B).
The processing of S-BMO within the gut was characterized by
triple quadrupole mass spectrometry of mucosal scrapings from
the proximal and distal segments of the small intestine and spiral
colon (corresponds to the ascending colon in humans), plus
cecal contents and feces. As expected, the concentrations of
NeuAc were significantly higher in both the cecal contents and
feces of S-BMO-supplemented animals (Figure 6C). Importantly,
we documented a significant increase in the concentration of
mucosal NeuAc in the proximal small intestine (Figure 6D), sug-
gesting that NeuAc in S-BMO is incorporated in host glycans.
This observation was site-specific; no significant differences in
mucosal NeuAc concentrations were observed in the distal small
intestine or spiral colon.
To investigate the effects of S-BMO on the community meta-
transcriptome, we performed microbial RNA sequencing (RNA-
seq) on RNA purified from cecal contents. We were unable to
detect differences in gene expression for any community mem-
bers using p < 0.1 as a threshold for statistical significance
(negative binomial test corrected using the Benjamini-Hochberg
procedure). Relaxing this cutoff to p < 0.2 revealed 1,482 bacte-
rial genes that exhibited differential expression with 1,481
(99.9%) showing significantly higher expression with S-BMO
treatment (Table S8). These differences are not attributable to
bacterial abundance: COPRO-seq established that S-BMO did
not significantly impact the relative abundance of any colonizing
strain (p > 0.05, Student’s t test) (Table S4B). Differentially ex-
pressed genes were not evenly distributed across the bacterial
community; five of the community’s 14 strains (Bacteroides fra-
gilis MC1, Bacteroides ovatus MC1, Collinsella aerofaciens MC1,

 Collinsella aerofaciens MC2, and Bifidobacterium catenulatum
MC1) together accounted for 1,300/1,482 (88%) of the differen-
tially expressed genes (Table S8). Expression levels of 587
B. fragilis genes were significantly elevated with S-BMO-supple-
mentation, more than any other community member. Among
these 587 genes, six encode enzymes that catalyze key steps
in the KEGG pathway for biosynthesis of BCAA (valine, leucine,
and isoleucine) (Figure S4), although the concentration of
BCAA in cecal contents was not significantly altered (p > 0.05,
Student’s t test) (Table S7C).
Consistent with our observations in non-fasted gnotobiotic
mice, the liver metabolic profiles of non-fasted, S-BMO-treated
piglets exhibited significantly reduced levels of five acylcarnitine
and nine fatty acyl CoA metabolites compared to controls (Fig-
ure 6E; Table S7C). In addition, we documented a striking pattern
of increased amino acid concentrations, including BCAAs, in
serum as well as skeletal muscle (Figures 6F and 6G; Table
S7C). Non-fasted, S-BMO-treated piglets also displayed trends
for decreased medium- and long-chain serum acylcarnitines
(p = 0.12, Student’s t test; Table S7C), increased serum triglyc-
erides (30.33 ± 13.05 mg/dl [mean ± SD] versus 10.33 ±
8.08 mg/dl; p = 0.08, Student’s t test), and increased serum
NEFA (0.07 ± 0.03 mM [mean ± SD] versus 0.04 ± 0.01 mM;
p = 0.2, Student’s t test).
Finally, to determine whether the effects of S-BMO on weight
gain in piglets were robust to the presence of an opportunistic
enteropathogen, 3-day-old animals were colonized with the
17-member bacterial community (Figure 6A; Table S2A) plus
two strains of Enterococcus faecalis that were present in the
Malawian infant’s 25-member culture collection. The genomes
of these two strains, E. faecalis MC1 and MC2, contain homologs
to 20 and 22 genes, respectively, present in the Virulence Factor
Database for the pathogenic E. faecalis strain V583 (Table S2B).
Gnotobiotic piglets were weaned onto the M8 diet by experi-
mental day 12. On day 15, animals were split into experimental
and control groups (n = 3 and 4, respectively), and for a period
of 5 days, piglets in the experimental group were fed the M8
diet supplemented with S-BMO. Control animals were fed un-
supplemented M8. COPRO-seq of fecal samples collected on
day 18 disclosed that 14/19 (74%) of the input strains, including
both strains of E. faecalis, colonized the recipient piglets (Table
S4C). S-BMO supplemented piglets gained significantly more
weight over the treatment period than unsupplemented controls
despite the presence of these two E. faecalis strains (p < 0.01,
repeated-measures, two-way ANOVA) (Figure 6H).
Together, these results led us to conclude that the effects of
S-BMO supplementation on weight gain and metabolic pheno-
types are a shared feature of gnotobiotic piglets and mice and
that these changes reflect, at least in part, improved utilization
of dietary components. Furthermore, the fact that S-BMO pro-
moted growth in the absence of E. coli provided additional evi-
dence that other members of the microbiota and/or their higher
order interactions are necessary to mediate these effects.
DISCUSSION
The data presented here from two separate studies of undernu-
trition in Malawi indicate that the breast milk of mothers whose
children exhibit growth faltering contains lower levels of HMOs,
including sialylated glycans, compared to milk from mothers of
healthy infants. Sialic acid-containing oligosaccharides are pre-
sent at up to 20-fold higher levels in mature human milk
compared to mature bovine milk (Tao et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2001). As a result, existing bovine milk-based infant formulas
and complementary/therapeutic foods used to treat undernutri-
tion are deficient in these important human milk components.
We have used two gnotobiotic animal models, each colonized
with a collection of bacterial strains cultured from a single
stunted Malawian infant and fed a prototypic Malawian diet, to
show that a purified preparation of sialylated bovine milk oligo-
saccharides resembling the sialylated HMOs that are depleted
in the breast milk of mothers with stunted infants produces bene-
ficial, microbiota-dependent effects on growth and metabolism.
The brains of breastfed infants possess higher levels of gangli-
oside- and glycoprotein-bound sialic acid than the brains of for-
mula-fed infants (Wang and Brand-Miller, 2003), consistent with
the higher sialic acid content of breast milk compared to bovine
milk-based infant formulas (Wang et al., 2001). Although the liver
can synthesize sialic acid de novo from glucose, the activity of
the rate-limiting enzyme, UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-2-epim-
erase, is low during the neonatal period (Gal et al., 1997), sug-
gesting that in the absence of human milk, sialic acid may be a
limiting resource at the time of rapid postnatal brain develop-
ment. Our finding that dietary S-BMO supplementation of gnoto-
biotic mice, harboring gut microbial community members from
an undernourished Malawian infant, leads to elevated levels of
NeuAc in the brain indicates that S-BMO can function as a sup-
plementary source of bioavailable sialic acid.
In addition to neural development, sialic acid may play a role
in healthy growth of the musculoskeletal system. S-BMO
increased bone cortical thickness and trabecular bone volume
in young gnotobiotic mice. The underlying mechanisms need
to be investigated, but this observation has a clinical correlate;
studies in Uganda reported reductions in fibular bone width in
3.5- to 7.5-year-old children who exhibited low body weight dur-
ing their first 2 years of postnatal life (McFie and Welbourn, 1962).
Moreover, studies of a mouse model of myopathy in which a
bifunctional rate-limiting enzyme in sialic acid biosynthesis
(Gne) is mutated, showed that addition of 60-sialyllactose to the
animals’ drinking water led to increased muscle mass and
improved contractility (Yonekawa et al., 2014).
Our results indicate that orally administered S-BMO restores
normal substrate utilization patterns, most notably (1) a strong
activation of fatty acid oxidation in fasting, as reflected by
increased levels of acylcarnitines, acyl CoAs, and the fatty acid
oxidation end product b-hydroxybutyrate, and (2) a pattern con-
sistent with enhanced anabolic metabolism of lipids in the fed
state, including increases in serum triglycerides and insulin, and
decreased levels of fatty acid oxidation intermediates. Additional
studies are needed to define how products of microbial biotrans-
formation of S-BMO impact energy balance and host metabolism
in ways that promote total body weight and lean body mass gain.
Our findings demonstrate that specific bacterial members of
the gut microbiota obtained from an undernourished Malawian
infant are able to metabolize S-BMO-derived sialyllactose to
its constituent monosaccharides. These monosaccharides are
868
Cell 164, 859–871, February 25, 2016 ª2016 Elsevier Inc.
 available for utilization by the host as well as members of the
microbiota, both mutualistic and pathogenic. The latter includes
pathogenic E. coli that are unable to harvest sialic acids them-
selves from host glycans or dietary sources (Almagro-Moreno
and Boyd, 2009). Therefore, it is important to consider that the
presence of primary consumers of sialylated oligosaccharides
maycreate opportunitiesforenteropathogenstoachieve afitness
benefit that could have deleterious effects on the host (Ng et al.,
2013). These findings encourage mindfulness with respect to
balancing potential benefits and risks when designing gut micro-
biota-directed clinical trials involving milk oligosaccharides.
While our analysis of breast milk specimens from Malawian
mothers disclosed an association between HMO abundance
and composition and infant growth, additional time-series
studies of maternal-infant dyads from Malawi and other coun-
tries are needed to determine the extent to which differences
in maternal HMO composition and variations in infant microbiota
structure and function (e.g., the capacity to metabolize HMOs),
correlate with infant growth outcomes. Nonetheless, gnotobiotic
models of the type we describe can play important roles in char-
acterizing oligosaccharides that are structurally similar to HMOs.
They provide a means to (1) elucidate their mechanisms of ac-
tion, including those that underlie effects on host metabolism
that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to glean from
non-invasive human studies, especially those involving infants,
(2) define the generalizability of their effects in the context of
gut microbiota from different human donors representing
different geographic locations and dietary practices, and (3)
identify clinically translatable microbial and host biomarkers
related to mechanism and safety. If additional human studies
provide evidence for a significant association between breast
milk HMO composition, infant gut microbiota configurations,
and growth outcomes, then results of the type described by
(1)–(3) should help inform the design of proof of concept clinical
studies that test the efficacy and safety of approaches such as
S-BMO supplementation for improving growth outcomes in un-
dernourished infants and children.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Human Studies
Human studies were conducted with the approval of institutional review
boards from the University of Malawi, Pirkanmaa Hospital (Finland), and Wash-
ington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. The mothers and infants
included in this study were enrolled in two randomized, controlled, single-
blind, parallel group clinical trials, LCNI-5 and iLiNS-DYAD-M (ClinicalTrials.
gov identifiers: NCT00524446 and NCT01239693). See the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for additional information.
Clonally Arrayed Culture Collection
The 25-member clonally arrayed culture collection was produced from a
frozen fecal sample collected from a severely stunted 6-month-old Malawian
infant (patient ID h264A in Yatsunenko et al. [2012]). For detailed information
relating to bacterial isolation, plus genome sequencing, assembly, and anno-
tation, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Purification and Compositional Analysis of S-BMO
S-BMO was purified from commercially available whey permeate using a se-
ries of ultrafiltration and chromatographic steps described in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Design and Preparation of the Malawi 8 Diet
This diet was formulated based on a dietary survey of the complementary
feeding practices of 43 9-month-old Malawian infants and children enrolled
in the iLiNS-DOSE clinical study (#NCT00945698) that took place in the Man-
gochi district of Malawi. See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for
details.
Studies Involving Gnotobiotic Mice
All gnotobiotic mouse experiments were performed using protocols approved
by the Washington University Animal Studies Committee. Male germ-free
C57BL/6J mice were maintained in sterile, flexible plastic gnotobiotic isola-
tors. Mice received a single oral gavage of the complete 25-member culture
collection or subsets of the collection 3 days after initiation of one of the M8-
based diets. For additional information, see the Supplemental Experimental
Procedures.
16S rRNA Gene Sequencing of Fecal Microbiota
Multiplex sequencing of barcoded bacterial 16S rRNA amplicons generated
from fecal microbiota samples was performed using an Illumina MiSeq instru-
ment. Taxonomic assignments were made with the Ribosomal Database Proj-
ect (RDP) version 2.4 classifier (Wang et al., 2007b). See the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures for detailed information about sample preparation,
PCR conditions, multiplex sequencing, and analysis of the resulting datasets.
Microbial RNA-Seq
Multiplex microbial cDNA sequencing was performed using Illumina Hi-
Seq2000, MiSeq, and NextSeq instruments. Reads were mapped to genes
in a custom database of 25 draft genomes of the strains included in the defined
Malawian infant bacterial community. Read counts were normalized and
analyzed with DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010). See the Supplemental Exper-
imental Procedures for additional information.
Mass Spectroscopy
Tissue samples were collected from gnotobiotic animals at time of euthanasia,
frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen, and stored at �80�C. In preparation for
GC/MS, UPLC/MS, and MS/MS analyses, samples were homogenized in
50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.3% formic acid (50 mg wet weight tis-
sue/ml solution). See the Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details
about analytic methods.
Gnotobiotic Piglets
All experiments were performed under the close supervision of a veterinarian
using protocols approved by the Washington University Animal Studies Com-
mittee. For detailed procedures relating to the derivation of germ-free piglets
and experimental design, see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
