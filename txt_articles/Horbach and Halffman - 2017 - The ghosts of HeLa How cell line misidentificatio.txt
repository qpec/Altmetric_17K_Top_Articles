Abstract
While problems with cell line misidentification have been known for decades, an unknown
number of published papers remains in circulation reporting on the wrong cells without warn-
ing or correction. Here we attempt to make a conservative estimate of this ‘contaminated’
literature. We found 32,755 articles reporting on research with misidentified cells, in turn
cited by an estimated half a million other papers. The contamination of the literature is not
decreasing over time and is anything but restricted to countries in the periphery of global sci-
ence. The decades-old and often contentious attempts to stop misidentification of cell lines
have proven to be insufficient. The contamination of the literature calls for a fair and reason-
able notification system, warning users and readers to interpret these papers with appropri-
ate care.
Introduction
The misidentification of cell lines is a stubborn problem in the biomedical sciences, contribut-
ing to the growing concerns about errors, false conclusions and irreproducible experiments [1,
2]. As a result of mislabelled samples, cross-contaminations, or inadequate protocols, some
research papers report results for lung cancer cells that turn out to be liver carcinoma, or
human cell lines that turn out to be rat [3, 4]. In some cases, these errors may only marginally
affect results; in others they render results meaningless [4].
The problems with cell line misidentification [5] have been known for decades, commenc-
ing with the controversies around HeLa cells in the 1960s [6–10]. In spite of several alarm
calls and initiatives to remedy the problem, misidentification continues to haunt biomedical
research, with new announcements of large-scale cross-contaminations and widespread use
of misidentified cell lines appearing even recently [11–13]. Although no exact numbers are
known, the extent of cell line misidentification is estimated between one fifth and one third
of all cell lines [4, 14]. (Although currently only 488 or 0.6% of over 80,000 known cell lines
have been reported as misidentified, most cell lines are used infrequently [15].) In addition,
misidentified cell lines keep being used under their false identities long after they have been
unmasked [16], while other researchers continue to build on their results. Considering the bio-
medical nature of research conducted on these cell lines, consequences of false findings are

search string and the Web of Science search
history based on it, along with instructions on how
to repeat our search in WoS. However, access to
data (i.e., the full list of articles found to be
reporting on misidentified cell lines) is conditional
upon approval by the research ethics committee of
the Science Faculty of the Radboud University
Nijmegen (via f.vandermolen@science.ru.nl). The
key concern leading to conditional access is that
 potentially severe and costly [17], with grants, patents and even drug trials based on misidenti-
fied cells [18]. Several case studies performed by the International Cell Line Authentication
Committee (ICLAC) highlight some of the potential consequences of using misidentified cell
lines [19, 20]. Especially in the last decade, the gravity of the problem has been widely acknowl-
edged, with several calls for immediate action in journal articles [3, 12, 21–23], requirements
for grant applications (e.g. [24, 25]) and even an open letter to the US secretary of health [26].
The current calls for action and remediation activities are almost exclusively concerned
with avoiding future contaminations, such as through systems for easier verification of cell line
identities. Various solutions have been proposed [27–29], among others employing genotypic
identification through short tandem repeats (STR) [30]. In addition, authors are expected to
check overviews of misidentified cells (such as [12, 15, 27, 31]) before conducting their experi-
ments. However, little attention is currently paid to the damage that has already been done
through the past distribution of research articles based on misidentified cells. Although sys-
tems such as retractions and corrections are available to alert other researchers of potential
problems in publications, these systems are rarely used to flag problems with cell lines [20, 32].
Even if future misidentifications could be avoided completely–which is not likely given the
track record of earlier attempts–these ‘contaminated’ articles will therefore continue to affect
research.
Before any action can be taken, it is essential that we get a sense of the size and nature of the
problem of contaminated literature. This raises several questions. First, how many research
articles have been based on misidentified or contaminated cell lines? How wide is their influ-
ence on the scientific literature? Second, what can we say about origins and trends in the con-
taminated literature? Is the problem getting better, or restricted to peripheral regions of the
world’s research, where perhaps protocols are less strict? Third, what could be appropriate
ways to deal with the contaminated literature? To answer these questions, we searched the lit-
erature for research papers using cell lines that are known to have been misidentified. In order
to put the results of this search in perspective, we analysed the precise complications of mis-
identification for three particular cell lines.
The process of distributing cell lines
To study the scale of literature contamination, we need to understand the process of setting
up, distributing, and publishing about cell lines. This process is illustrated in Fig 1.
Briefly, setting up a novel cell line commences with a tissue sample from an organism,
human or other. If this culture grows successfully, the establishment of a new cell line is some-
times reported in what we will call an ‘establishing paper’. Subsequently, scientists may share
or obtain this cell line, either via their personal network or via cell banks. These scientists may
perform research on this cell line and publish their findings in scientific journals, thereby set-
ting up what we call the primary literature based on a cell line.
At some point, a cell line may be found to be misidentified. This observation may be pub-
lished in a ‘notifying paper’, leading to a registration in the International Cell Line Authentica-
tion Committee’s (ICLAC) database of cross-contaminated or misidentified cell lines [12].
Based on available data, cell lines can be added to one of two tables. The first is reserved for cell
lines with no known authentic stock, and the second for cell lines where authentic stock is
known to exist.
In this paper, we focus on the first category only: cell lines without any reported original
stock. In this case, it must be assumed that all primary literature could be based on false
grounds and should at least be treated with caution. In addition, we tried to estimate the size of

the data provide a rough estimate of the size of the
problem of cell line misidentifications
contaminating the research literature. It is NOT a
way to accuse individual researchers, research
teams, or research institutes, as the data are not
sufficiently precise and will lead to false positives
(and hence false accusations). Using the data
without sufficient notice of the context might lead
to false accusations targeting individual scientists
or research institutes which could have severe
negative consequences for individuals involved.
Researchers wanting to re-use these data will have
to convince the ethics committee that data will not
be used for such purposes.

Materials and methods
Gathering data
Version 8.0 of the ICLAC list of misidentified cell lines [12] was published in December 2016
(http://iclac.org/databases/cross-contaminations/). From this list we only used table 1, listing
those cell lines for which no authentic stock of the originally presumed cell line is reported.
This list holds 451 cell lines. The identification of research articles using any of these misidenti-
fied cell lines was more difficult than expected. Although any article based on research using
one of the listed cell lines supposedly mentions this cell line, the information is frequently not
incorporated in one of the searchable fields in large databases (such as title, abstract or key-
words), not even in otherwise well-documented biomedical databases such as PubMed. There-
fore, the exact number of papers based on misidentified cell lines cannot be established.
However, we could identify articles that either refer to the establishing article of a misidentified
Fig 1. The creation, distribution and literature of a cell line: A cultured sample of cells (blue cells) may produce an
immortal cell line (red cells), sometimes announced in ‘an establishing paper’ (in white). Cells may then be
distributed to other researchers and reported in research papers, the ‘primary literature’. If misidentification of cells is
reported in ‘a notifying paper’ (in red, bottom left), this may raise questions about the entire cell line (question marks) and
the papers based on it, since misidentification commonly occurs at the source. Notifying papers should be reported to
ICLAC, which will decide whether cell lines should be added to the ICLAC misidentified cell line register. Meanwhile, the
contaminated primary literature is cited (dotted lines) by ‘secondary literature’, spreading the contamination further.

 cell line, or that name the cell line in their title, abstract or key words. This search was carried
out within the Web of Science database, because this platform allows for detailed citation anal-
ysis. We used the following two search methods to obtain conservative estimates of the num-
ber of research articles based on misidentified cell lines:
Method 1. For any cell line on the ICLAC list we tried to find an original article that
reports the establishment of the cell line. These ‘establishing articles’ were searched using the
Cellosaurus database [15], and subsequent references herein to the German collection of
microorganisms and cell lines (DSMZ) database, the American Type Culture Collection
(ATCC) database, and the European Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures (ECACC) data-
base. The DSMZ, ATCC and ECACC databases were consulted to check for references to any
establishing article on one of the cell lines. Establishing articles were found for 255 cell lines.
Subsequently, the original articles found in this fashion were searched in the Web of Science
database. All references to the establishing articles were collected. We considered a reference
to this original article as a good proxy for the usage of a cell line, since typically the original
papers are focused on reporting the establishment of the cell line only (as checked in our three
case studies described below).
It could be argued that we went too far back in time. It is a common phenomenon that arti-
cles have a limited ‘lifespan’, the time during which they receive citations, which would mean
that older establishing articles would currently be poorly cited as the cell lines they announced
are no longer relevant. To test for this we considered the citation lifespan of all establishing
articles published before 1980. They turned out to have an average citation lifespan of over 40
years and the majority of them still received citations in 2016 or 2017. Hence we believe there
are good reasons to be inclusive of even relatively old establishing papers.
Method 2. We searched the WoS database for all articles stating the names of one of the
451 listed cell lines in their title, abstract or keywords, as well as one of the words: ‘cell(s)’ or
‘cell line(s)’. In order to provide for more accurate search results, we only searched articles in
the 25 research fields (as defined by WoS) that were most common among the results of the
first search method. Thereby we excluded articles that use misidentified cell lines, but were
classified in fields in which research on cell lines is less common. We note that even though
the research areas as defined by WoS may overlap, classifying articles in more than a single
research area, this has not lead to double counting in our analysis: all articles included in one
of the 25 identified research areas were only counted once.
Verification of data
Several strategies were employed to verify the validity of the data and to reduce the number of
‘false positives’ (i.e. those articles ending up in our sample, without reporting on research with
misidentified cell lines). Regarding search method 1, we closely verified all establishing articles
that resulted in at least 100 hits of primary articles in our database (n = 41). In this verification
we found one article that was actually a notifying paper instead of an establishing paper and
hence deleted it from our search. In addition, four articles were found that report on the estab-
lishment of several cell lines, some of which are not listed in the ICLAC database. In two of
these cases, the establishing article reports on both the establishment of the contaminated cell
line as well as the contaminating cell line (in the cases of EJ138 and HPB-MLT). We decided to
not delete those establishing articles from our database, because they yield only few false posi-
tives (order of magnitude of tens) in our database.
Regarding search method 2: Due to some names of cell lines that could easily be confused
with other meanings (such as ‘WISH’, ‘CaVe’ or ‘EU-1’), this search created noise. Therefore
we used an iterative process to delete this noise. This process proceeded as follows: we

 observed a random sample of 100 articles, sampled by ordering the articles on publication data
and selecting every 200th hit. We checked whether the articles found actually used one of the
listed cell lines, this was done by first reading the abstract of the found articles and, in case of
doubt, further consulting the full text. If the research reported in the article did not use one of
the listed cell lines, the search term that found this article was either replaced by: “name of cell
line cell�” (e.g. “WISH cell�” instead of “WISH”), which was done in 26 cases, or the search
term was deleted from the query (in cases of very generic words such as in the case of the ‘OF’
cell line), which was done in 15 cases (see Supporting Information S1 File for a list). (In this
search, the asterisk (�) signifies a wildcard, i.e. the term ‘cell�’ will find any word starting with
‘cell’.) We continued this process until the samples did not contain false positives due to struc-
tural issues in the search terms.
Subsequently, the process of randomly selecting 100 articles was iterated four times and was
executed independently by both authors. Concluding from the results in the random samples,
our search method provides reliable results. Nevertheless, the results inevitably contain
remaining false positives, the extent of which is estimated to a maximum of 10% of the con-
taminated primary literature, judged by our verification through random samples of the set, in
which 6.5% of the articles was found to consist of false positives The set of false positives con-
tains, among others, articles using cells in the ICLAC register that are nonetheless reported
with their correct origin (as reported for KB cells by Vaughan et al. [20]).
All claims in this article are based on a dataset of articles found through either method 1 or
2. Both searches were performed without additional software tools, but with manual searches
working with complex Boolean search strings. To gather information on the secondary litera-
ture, i.e. those articles citing the articles in the primary literature, we used the standard WoS
‘citation report’. In the secondary literature we excluded self-citations in order to observe the
actual ‘spreading’ of the contaminated literature. The exclusion of self-citations is a standard
option in the WoS’ citation report.
Case studies
In order to verify the collected data and to get a deeper understanding of how knowledge
based on misidentified cell lines spreads through the literature, we performed three case stud-
ies in which we tracked the publications concerning a single cell line or a family of cell lines.
All three are misidentified cell lines for which no original stock was reported and were selected
at random from the ICLAC database. The case studies were performed on the cell lines:
ALVA-31, a family of thymic cell lines (F2-4E5, F2-5B6, P1-1A3 and P1-4D6), and JCA-1. The
results of the case studies indicate that our search method indeed renders accurate data, with
only very few ‘false positives’, and rather conservative estimates.
Analyses of the contaminated literature’s origins
We performed several analyses on the contaminated primary literature’s origins based on
WoS data, analysing their temporal and geographical origin and the distribution over research
areas. The development over time uses the WoS publication date of the definitive version of
the article; hence electronic versions may have been published prior to this date. The WoS
goes back to 1945, but is incomplete for the first decades of the database. For the geographical
origin of the research records, we employed the WoS category ‘Country/Territory’, which is
based on the affiliation of the authors. The origins of the contaminated primary literature are
compared with the total literature on research involving cell lines. This total literature com-
prises the articles that mention any word starting with ‘cell’ (i.e. cell, cells, cellular, etc.) in their
title, keywords or abstract (hence not only misidentified cells), and belong to the 25 WoS-

 defined research areas that were most common among the dataset of contaminated primary
literature. This reference group was also used to estimate what fraction of the relevant total lit-
erature is contaminated (see under the heading Contamination of the scientific literature).
Results
Contamination of the scientific literature
Using ICLAC’s Database of Cross-Contaminated or Misidentified Cell lines [12], we searched
the scientific literature with the Web of Science (WoS) [33] to identify research articles based
on misidentified cell lines. Using complementary search strategies (see methods), we were able
to identify 32,755 articles (on August 4th, 2017) based on cell lines that are currently known to
be different from the cell lines reported in these publications. As we only searched for cell lines
known to be misidentified, this constitutes a conservative estimate of the scale of contamina-
tion in the primary literature. Moreover, to avoid false positives, we excluded several cell lines,
such as the ones with non-unique identifiers or the cell lines for which verified stock is still in
circulation. With non-unique identifiers we refer to names of cell lines that do not only refer
to the cell line but (potentially) also to other phenomena. For example the case of the ‘OF’ cell
line or the ‘WISH’ cell line. With ‘non-unique identifier’ we hence do not refer to cell lines
that have multiple names or names with multiple spellings (such as the Intestine 407 cell line,
which is also called ‘Intestine407’, ‘Int-407’ and ‘Int407’). In cases of multiple spellings of cell
line names, we stuck to the spelling indicated in the ICLAC database. Thereby we probably
missed many articles using these cell lines in search method 2, again leading to conservative
estimates.
In addition, research based on misidentified cell lines has a wide impact on the scientific lit-
erature, as it appears that these research papers are comparatively highly cited. WoS does not
allow for precise total numbers, but we can give indications of this ‘secondary contamination’
of the literature. Analysing citations to primary contaminated articles, we found 46 papers
with more than a thousand citations and over 2600 contaminated articles with over a hundred
citations. Furthermore, over 92% of the contaminated papers are cited at least once, which is
more than average for biomedical literature [34]. In total, we can conservatively estimate the
citations to the primary contaminated primary literature at over 500,000, excluding self-cita-
tions, thereby leaving traces in a substantial share of the biomedical literature. Even though it
is clear that articles may receive citations for many reasons, including negative or even ritual
citations, and hence not all citing articles contain (critical) errors, the amount of research
potentially building on false grounds remains worrisome.
A spreadsheet with all results can be found in the Supplementary Material (S2 File). This
table lists all cell lines in the ICLAC database and the number of articles in the primary and
secondary literature reporting on these cell lines, both for search method 1 and 2. In addition,
the mean citation rate for articles in the primary literature is given as well as information on
the temporal distribution of the secondary literature (the first and last year in which articles
are published as well as the year in which most of the secondary literature on this cell line
appeared). Given the fact that citation distributions tend to form (truncated) bell-shaped
curves, this information provides reasonable insight in the temporal distribution of the sec-
ondary literature. The data is listed per cell line and not summarised, as this approach could
lead to double counts.
The total number of research articles on cells can be estimated between 4.5 and 5 million
(see methods). Therefore, the contaminated primary literature makes up a little under 0.8% of
the total literature on cells, while the (potentially) contaminated secondary literature can be
estimated in the order of 10% of the total research output in this area. However, we should

 stress that our aim is to measure the size of the problem. The sample undoubtedly contains
false positives and is hence not suitable to identify individual contaminations.
Closer inspection of primary literature
An objection to our findings might be that our general search methods do not provide a
proper overview of how specific misidentified cell lines actually affect research. To get a deeper
understanding of how knowledge based on misidentified cell lines spreads through the litera-
ture, we present three case studies in which we tracked the publications concerning a single
cell line or a family of cell lines. All three are misidentified cell lines for which no original stock
was reported and were selected at random from the ICLAC database.
ALVA-31.
This cell line was originally established in 1993 as a human prostate carcinoma
[35], but was found to be identical to a different human prostate carcinoma, the PC-3 cell line,
in 2001 [36, 37]. We found 56 articles referring to ALVA-31, which are in turn cited by 2615
articles. Of these 56 primary articles, 22 were published after the misidentification of the
ALVA-31 cell line was discovered. On closer inspection of those 22 articles, it appears that the
ALVA-31 cell line was actually used in 20 of them, while only two articles mention the cell
line’s misidentification. Remarkably, the most recent articles describing research based on
ALVA-31 cells are published in 2016, fifteen years after the misidentification was reported.
In this case, one could argue that it might do little harm to use ALVA-31 cells, while actually
working with PC-3 cells, because both are human prostate carcinoma and share many charac-
teristics. However, in some cases, even researchers themselves argue that the precise identity of
ALVA-31 is essential: “To exclude a cell type-specific effect, we extended ALVA-31 studies to
other human PCa cell types” [38]. Subsequently, the authors explain how they used PC-3 cells
in additional studies to ‘exclude cell type-specific effects’; in effect comparing two identical cell
lines.
Thymic cell lines.
In a 1994 report, the establishment of a group of novel thymic cell lines
(F2-4E5, F2-5B6, P1-1A3 and P1-4D6) [39] was announced. In a report by MacLeod et al.
[40], the cell lines were found to be misidentified, having been derived in fact from a liver car-
cinoma. In total, 69 articles were found that refer to these cell lines, in turn cited by 2092 arti-
cles. Of the primary articles, 43 were published after the report by MacLeod et al. and the most
recent one was published only in late 2016 [41]. Of the fifteen most recent articles referring to
the 1994 report, thirteen actually refer to it because they use the cell lines, all thirteen reporting
research on thymic cells, without mentioning any knowledge of the misidentification of these
cell lines. The other two articles refer to the establishing article for the sake of the method used
in it to establish novel cell lines.
JCA-1.
The JCA-1 cell line was originally established in 1990 [42] and found to be mis-
identified in 2001 by van Bokhoven et al. [43], who showed that the cells in fact are derived
from a bladder carcinoma rather than a prostate carcinoma. We found 64 articles referring to
the establishing paper or explicitly mentioning JCA-1 in their title, key words or abstract. In
turn, these articles are cited by 3352 articles. Of the primary articles, 18 appeared after the
report by van Bokhoven et al. In contrast to the cell lines discussed previously, there seems to
be no contemporary usage of JCA-1 in scientific research: the most recent article describing
research using this cell line dates from 2009. However, also in this case, several articles were
published reporting to use ‘prostate cancer cell lines’, after it became known that JCA-1 actu-
ally originated from bladder carcinoma. In fact, as we verified in the full text, of the 18 articles
published after the report by van Bokhoven et al. [43], only 3 show awareness of the fact that
the line had been misidentified. In contrast, 14 simply stated to have used the JCA-1 cell line,
the vast majority explicitly referring to them as prostate cancer cells.

 As these case studies show, merely listing a cell line as misidentified does not deter scientists
from using it. This constitutes additional evidence for the claim that avoiding future contami-
nations does not form a complete solution to the issue of cell line misidentification. Instead,
demonstrably misidentified cell lines continue to have an impact on research, either directly
because scientists keep using them, or indirectly because scientists build on previous research
employing misidentified lines. (Additional case studies on the consequences of using misiden-
tified cell lines can be found at the ICLAC webpage [19].)
A transitory problem?
One might wonder whether the contamination of the research literature is mainly a problem
of the past, given that the first concerns about misidentified cell lines were expressed half a cen-
tury ago [9, 10] and that numerous initiatives have tried to alleviate the problem since.
Based on the set of 32,755 records of primary contaminated literature, we analysed the pub-
lication dates of the articles. The majority of the articles, 57%, were written since 2000 and the
number of articles using misidentified cell lines is still growing (see Fig 2). Clearly, the problem
is definitely not one of the past, but is very relevant to contemporary science, with 58 new arti-
cles based on contaminated literature appearing even as recently as February 2017.
Fig 2 indicates three moments in history when cell line contamination became evident.
First, through the work of Stanley Gartler it became possible to detect intraspecies cell contam-
ination, after which several of such contaminations involving HeLa cells were reported in
Nature in 1968 [9, 10]. Second, cell culture contamination was put on the global research
agenda by the work of Walter Nelson-Rees et al. in the 1970s [7, 8], culminating in a list of con-
taminated cell cultures in Science in 1981 that demonstrated large-scale contamination of cell

intraspecies cell line misidentification [10], a major list of misidentified cell lines based on HeLa contaminations [44] and the introduction of
Short Tandem Repeat (STR) as technique for cell line authentication [45].

 cultures by HeLa cells [44]. From this point on, it could be expected that most scientists work-
ing in those areas of research frequently employing cell cultures, were aware of the potential
issues with their research material. However, the vast majority of research papers based on
misidentified cell lines was published after this point in time. Even after the introduction of
STR in 2001 [45], the annual number does not decrease.
Similar to the primary literature, the number of articles in the secondary literature is also
still growing. In 2016, over 40,000 papers were published that referred to primary contami-
nated literature. In addition, from the information in the Supplementary Material (S2 File),
we conclude that the majority of misidentified cell lines continue to contaminate the sec-
ondary literature in 2017 (251 cell lines for search method 1 and 232 cell lines for search
method 2), while dozens of cell lines created most of their secondary literature in the past
two years (38 for search method 1 and 87 for search method 2). Moreover, we conclude that
many cell lines (108 for search method 1, 87 for search method 2) have generated contami-
nation in secondary literature for a period of more than 25 years, with articles appearing
long after it became known that the cell line was misidentified. Hence the contamination of
the literature through reference to articles using misidentified cell lines remains a very topi-
cal problem.
A peripheral problem?
Another objection to our findings could be that cross-contamination occurs particularly in
regions with new or emerging research communities, in which levels of training or access to
testing facilities may be limited. For example, several recent publications indicate levels of cell
line contamination for China between 25% [13] and 46% [46] and demonstrate that of all
‘new’ cell lines developed in China 85% actually turned out to be HeLa cells [13].
However, the majority of the articles using misidentified cell lines originate from countries
holding well-established research traditions (e.g. US, Japan, Germany). Relative to their share
of total research output, authors from these countries often perform research on misidentified
cell lines. In fact, mainly due to their enormous share of total literature on cell lines, over 36%
of all contaminated primary literature stems from the US. Fig 3 shows the percentage of con-
taminated primary articles as a fraction of the total number of articles on cells per country (see
Supplementary Materials S2 File for data). It includes the 25 countries with the largest share of
the contaminated primary literature. In this list, we see countries holding excellent research
reputations ranking high. Hence, the problem does not only occur in regions with low stan-
dards of quality and diligence in research, but is also a problem in countries that hold excellent
research reputations. Nevertheless, an analysis of the literature for the past five years showed a
dramatic rise of China’s share in the contaminated literature, confirming recent worries
expressed in the literature [13].
Last, we analysed which research disciplines were most affected by the use of misidentified
cell lines. Fig 4 shows the distribution of contaminated articles over the various research areas
as defined by WoS. Among the contaminated primary literature, oncology, biochemistry/
molecular biology, pharmacology and cell biology are most affected, confirming concerns
about medical applications.
However, analysis of citations obtained by the primary literature indicates that the second-
ary literature spreads to a much more diverse range of research areas. The articles in the sec-
ondary literature originate also in fields rarely using cell lines for their research, such as
psychiatry, engineering and agriculture science, see Fig 4. Consequently, the impact of mis-
identified cell cultures may spread to non-biomedical fields and affect scientists that are not as
trained to judge the validity of research on misidentified cell lines.

 Discussion
Potential counter arguments
Our results seem to present worrying problems for the biomedical sciences. Although the issue
of misidentified cell lines has long been known, its effect on the scientific literature has not
been properly recognised, let alone properly treated [47, 48]. However, various arguments
have been presented to suggest that papers based on misidentified cell lines are still valuable
and that no remedial action is needed.
First, it has been asserted that, in some cases, the origin or specific characteristics of a cell
line might be of little influence on the results of an experiment. Indeed, in some cases all that a
researcher needs is ‘a cell line’, independent of type, origin or status. In fact, this argument was
already mentioned by Gartler in 1968 to put his findings into perspective [10]. To be sure, we
acknowledge that not all 32,755 articles that we found contain critical errors. However, this is
not a valid argument not to label articles that employ misidentified cell lines, for two reasons.
To begin with, it is currently up to every individual scientist to judge the status of an article
every time they cite or read it, by first checking the ICLAC database of misidentified cell lines
to see whether any of the cell lines used in an article are in this database, and subsequently
judging the influence that the misidentification may have on the results. This is a cumbersome
and unlikely assumption about how researchers cite their literature, given the low levels of
awareness indicated in our analysis. In addition, the secondary literature spreads into research
fields that do not commonly use cell lines for their research. It is particularly doubtful whether
scientists from these fields are aware of the potential issues with research on cell lines and

figure includes the 25 countries with the largest absolute number of articles in the contaminated primary literature.

 whether they are in the position to make informed decisions about the validity of the claims in
research articles based on misidentified cell lines.
Second, it has been argued that no remedial action is needed, as the problem will be
addressed by new verification techniques. Similarly, it has been argued that the problem is
already widely known, that scientists may be expected to implement effective lab protocols and
be sufficiently critical about cell lines and their literature. Hence contaminated literature
should have faded beyond the time horizon of literature considered relevant for current
research and have disappeared from the relevant research record [49]. However, there is no
sign of any ‘fading away’ of the problem. As we demonstrated, both the number of articles
using misidentified cell lines, and the number of articles referring to them are still growing.
Moreover, as demonstrated in the case studies, scientists show little awareness of the fact that
cell lines may be misidentified. The citation analysis of the primary literature shows that arti-
cles keep being cited long after misidentifications have been reported, with over 40,000 articles
citing contaminated research articles in 2016, including hundreds of citations to primary con-
taminated literature published decades ago.
Practical measures
Over the past decades thorough attention has been paid to the improvement of authentication
testing for cell lines. Authentication of cell lines, and hence the ability to demonstrate cross

 contamination, became possible by the introduction of genetic markers by Gartler in 1967 [9].
Subsequently, many techniques for cell line authentication were introduced, starting off with
inspection of banded marker chromosomes [8], and the visualization of chromosomal pattern
and architecture in general [50], subsequently followed by the methods of Human Leukocyte
Antigen (HLA) typing [51], enzyme polymorphisms [52] and DNA polymorphisms [53].
More recently, the techniques of ‘DNA fingerprinting’ [54] and the usage of locus-specific
probes were introduced. Finally, this led to the now accepted standard method of short tandem
repeat profiling [45]. As has been pointed out recently, the techniques for proper cell line
authentication are now widely available [55]. However, implementation of these techniques is
still falling short for multiple reasons, including time and financial constraints, lack of training
and lack of (international) standards [55].
Despite measures to authenticate new and existing cell lines [27], research based on the
wrong cells is still present in the literature and in fact continues to be published. Some form of
precautionary labelling of contaminated articles seems unavoidable. However, this remedial
action should be proportionate and not cause unnecessary damage. For some individual scien-
tists, research departments, or scientific journals, rash measures could turn out to be painful.
Indeed, some researchers have authored over a hundred articles in our set of contaminated
primary literature. Even though the problem with these articles almost exclusively [56] falls
under the heading of ‘honest error’, with no intention to deceive, notifying all those articles as
potentially erroneous, or worse: retracting them, would have a disproportionate impact on sev-
eral scientists’ careers. This would undermine, rather than support, an effective clean-up oper-
ation. However, in addition to catching cell line contamination at the source, initiatives to
label contaminations ‘downstream’ in the published literature are direly needed. We can make
several suggestions.
First, notifications should be posted alongside previously published articles using misidenti-
fied cell lines. This could be done in the form of ‘expressions of concern’, which are described
as “Neither retractions nor corrections, they alert readers that there may be an issue with a paper,
when the full story is not yet clear.” [57] If clear and uncontended, the consequences of the mis-
identification for the article’s conclusions could be reported, but otherwise the expression of
concern could merely state: “Cell line X in this study is known to be misidentified and is actu-
ally Y. See Z for more information.” The interpretation of this warning is then entirely up to
the expert reader. Such notifications would also serve to preserve as much valuable data as pos-
sible: data reported on a misidentified cell line might still be entirely valid, provided the real
origin of the cell line is clear. Hence it might be a waste of funds and efforts to automatically
dismiss these data. In cases where the use of these cell lines leads to (severely) false conclusions
that could have a major impact on future research, articles could be retracted. For recent cases,
a system of self-retractions, as proposed by Fanelli [58], could be employed.
Second, to allow for simple future identification of articles using misidentified cell lines, we
recommend that authors mention the employed cell lines in easily searchable parts of their
article, such as the keywords or abstract. Some journals have already suggested measures in
this direction, but implementation seems to be slow [30]. However, some journals have cur-
rently installed a system of Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs), which might assist in tack-
ling the cell line misidentification issues [59]. Alternatively, a system of cross-reference
between databases of cell lines and scientific journal publications could be set up. Linking the
NCBI databases of ‘BioSamples’ and ‘research articles’ would be a natural candidate for such a
system. In similar ways, the Cellosaurus database, the ICLAC database and Research Resource
Initiative are already cross-linked.
In addition, better use could be made of paper trails for cell line provenance [60]. A clear
and complete overview of the origin of a cell line, as well as the various verification tests, the

 experiments that it has been part of, and the results that these yielded, would be of great benefit
in examining the status and quality of a cell line. In addition, this would allow for easy identifi-
cation of potentially erroneous research when a cell line is found to be misidentified.
Besides being of use in terms of recognition of erroneous research, the paper trail might
also serve other purposes, such as mapping the existing knowledge on a certain cell line
(thereby also allowing for simple identification of knowledge gaps) and providing a stage for
the publication of negative results of experiments on cell lines. The publication of such results
has long been proposed as a way of fostering integrity in research [61].
Nearly half a century after the first concerns about misidentified cell lines, the initiatives to
improve authentication need to be complemented by attention to the already contaminated lit-
erature. Our analysis shows that the task is sizeable and urgent.
