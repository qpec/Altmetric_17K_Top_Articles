Objectives:
 To  examine
 the relationship
 between
 chronic
 training
 loads,
 number
 of
 exposures
 to
 maximal
velocity,
 the  distance
 covered
 at maximal
 velocity,
 percentage
 of  maximal
 velocity
 in  training  and
 match-
play
 and  subsequent
 injury
 risk  in
 elite  Gaelic
 footballers.
Design:
 Prospective
 cohort
 design.
Methods:
 Thirty-seven
 elite  Gaelic  footballers
 from  one
 elite  squad  were
 involved
 in a
 one-season
 study.
Training
 and
 game  loads  (session-RPE
 multiplied
 by  duration
 in  min)  were  recorded
 in  conjunction
 with
external
 match
 and  training  loads
 (using  global
 positioning
 system
 technology)
 to  measure  the distance
covered
 at  maximal
 velocity,
 relative  maximal
 velocity
 and  the  number
 of  player  exposures
 to  maximal
velocity
 across
 weekly  periods
 during  the season.
 Lower  limb
 injuries
 were  also  recorded.
 Training
 load
and
 GPS  data  were  modelled
 against
 injury
 data
 using
 logistic  regression.
 Odds  ratios  (OR)
 were  calculated
based
 on  chronic
 training  load  status,
 relative  maximal
 velocity
 and  number
 of  exposures
 to
 maximal
velocity
 with  these
 reported
 against
 the lowest  reference
 group  for  these
 variables.
Results:
 Players
 who  produced
 over  95%  maximal  velocity
 on  at  least one  occasion
 within
 training
 envi-
ronments
 had lower  risk  of  injury  compared
 to the  reference
 group  of 85%  maximal
 velocity  on
 at  least
one
 occasion
 (OR: 0.12,  p  =
 0.001).  Higher
 chronic
 training
 loads
 (≥4750
 AU)  allowed
 players
 to
 tolerate
increased
 distances
 (between
 90  to  120  m)  and  exposures
 to maximal
 velocity
 (between
 10  to
 15  expo-
sures),
 with  these  exposures
 having
 a  protective
 effect  compared
 to  lower
 exposures
 (OR:
 0.22  p =  0.026)
and
 distance
 (OR  =  0.23,  p  =
 0.055).
Conclusions:
 Players
 who  had higher
 chronic
 training  loads
 (≥4750  AU)  tolerated
 increased
 distances
and
 exposures
 to  maximal
 velocity
 when
 compared
 to players
 exposed
 to low
 chronic
 training  loads
(≤4750
 AU).  Under-  and  over-exposure
 of
 players
 to maximal
 velocity
 events
 (represented
 by a  U-shaped
curve)
 increased
 the  risk
 of  injury.

 Introduction
Training
 load
 has
 been
 reported
 as
 a
 modifiable
 risk
 factor
 for
subsequent
 injury.1 Several
 studies
 have
 investigated
 the
 influence
of
 training
 workload
 and
 injury
 risk
 in
 team
 sports.
 In
 profes-
sional
 rugby
 union,
 players1 higher
 1-week
 (>1245
 AU)
 and
 4-week
cumulative
 loads
 (>8651
 AU)
 were
 associated
 with
 a
 greater
 risk
of
 injury.
 Furthermore,
 Rogalski
 et
 al.2 observed
 that
 larger
 1-
weekly
 (>1750
 arbitrary
 units,
 OR
 =
 2.44–3.38),
 2-weekly
 (>4000
arbitrary
 units,
 OR
 =
 4.74)
 and
 previous
 to
 current
 week
 changes
in
 load
 (>1250
 arbitrary
 units,
 OR
 =

 were

to
 greater
 injury
 risk
 throughout
 the
 in-season
 phase
 in
 elite
 Aus-
tralian
 rules
 football
 players.
The
 ability
 to
 produce
 high
 speeds
 is
 considered
 an
 important
quality
 for
 performance,
 with
 athletes
 shown
 to
 achieve
 85–94%
 of
maximal
 velocity
 during
 team
 sport
 match-play.3 Well-developed
high-speed
 running
 ability
 and
 maximal
 velocity
 are
 required
 of
players
 during
 competition
 in
 order
 to
 beat
 opposition
 players
to
 possession
 and
 gain
 an
 advantage
 in
 attacking
 and
 defensive
situations.4,5 In
 order
 to
 optimally
 prepare
 players
 for
 these
 maxi-
mal
 velocity
 and
 high
 speed
 elements
 of
 match
 play,
 players
 require
regular
 exposure
 to
 periods
 of
 high-speed
 running
 during
 training
environments6.
 Recent
 evidence
 suggests
 that
 lower
 limb
 injuries
are
 associated
 with
 excessive
 high-speed
 running
 exposure.7,8

within
 training
 sessions
 were
 2.7
 and
 3.7
 times
 more
 likely
 to
 sus-
tain
 a
 non-contact,
 soft
 tissue
 injury
 than
 players
 who
 performed
less
 very-high
 speed
 running.8,9 However,
 these
 studies
 failed
 to
assess
 the
 potential
 impact
 that
 chronic
 training
 load
 could
 have
 on
reducing
 the
 injury
 risk
 in
 these
 players.
 Currently
 there
 is
 a
 lack
 of
understanding
 of
 the
 potential
 benefits
 of
 maximal
 velocity
 expo-
sures
 and
 also
 the
 minimum
 dose
 required
 to
 provide
 protection
against
 injuries.
Recent
 evidence
 suggests
 that
 high
 chronic
 training
 loads
 can
offer
 a
 protective
 stimulus
 for
 team
 sport
 athletes.10,11 Australian
rules
 football
 players
 with
 higher
 1
 week
 training
 loads
 (>3519
 AU)
were
 at
 reduced
 risk
 of
 injury
 (OR
 =
 0.199)
 compared
 to
 players
exposed
 to
 lower
 training
 loads
 (<3518
 AU).12 Additionally
 Cross
et
 al.1 have
 reported
 a
 U-shaped
 curve
 for
 training
 load
 and
 injury
risk
 in
 elite
 rugby
 union
 players
 with
 low
 and
 high
 training
 loads
increasing
 injury
 risk,
 and
 intermediate
 loads
 reducing
 injury
 risk.
High
 aerobic
 fitness
 has
 been
 reported
 to
 offer
 a
 protective
 effect
against
 subsequent
 lower
 limb
 injury
 for
 team
 sport
 players.6
Higher
 training
 loads
 may
 be
 needed
 to
 provide
 the
 appropriate
stimulus
 for
 aerobic
 fitness
 improvements6 with
 lower
 training
loads
 potentially
 placing
 players
 at
 increased
 risk
 due
 to
 a
 lack
 of
exposure
 to
 the
 physical
 stimulus
 required
 for
 competitive
 play.6
Although
 greater
 amounts
 of
 high-speed
 running
 have
 been
associated
 with
 injury
 risk,
 there
 is
 evidence
 that
 players
 are
 often
required
 to
 perform
 maximal
 efforts
 over
 short
 to
 moderate
 dis-
tances
 during
 competition
 and
 training.13,14,15 Training
 for
 team
sport
 ultimately
 requires
 a
 balance
 between
 appropriately
 pre-
scribed
 training
 loads
 to
 develop
 the
 required
 physical
 qualities
to
 compete
 while
 also
 allowing
 the
 appropriate
 recovery
 between
sessions
 and
 match-play
 to
 minimise
 injury
 risk
 for
 players.
 Given
the
 need
 for
 players
 to
 perform
 maximal
 efforts
 during
 match-play,
exposure
 of
 players
 to
 these
 maximal
 efforts
 during
 training
 may
offer
 a
 “vaccine”
 against
 soft-tissue
 injury.6 However,
 the
 inter-
relationship
 among
 these
 training
 variables
 and
 potential
 injury
risk
 is
 poorly
 understood.
 Therefore
 the
 aim
 of
 the
 current
 inves-
tigation
 was
 to
 examine
 exposure
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 events
 as
a
 potential
 modifiable
 risk
 factor
 for
 injury
 within
 Gaelic
 football.
Additionally
 with
 higher
 chronic
 training
 loads
 offering
 a
 protective
effect
 from
 injury
 in
 other
 sports,
 there
 is
 a
 need
 to
 investigate
 the
interaction
 of
 chronic
 training
 loads,
 maximal
 velocity
 exposure,
and
 injury
 risk
 within
 Gaelic
 football.
 Accordingly,
 we  explored
 the
relationship
 between
 training
 load,
 the
 number
 of
 maximal
 veloc-
ity
 exposures
 during
 training
 and
 match-play,
 the
 distance
 covered
at
 maximal
 velocity
 and
 injury
 risk
 in
 elite
 Gaelic
 football
 players.
2.
 Methods
The
 current
 investigation
 was
 a
 prospective
 cohort
 study
 of
 elite
Gaelic
 football
 players
 competing
 at
 the
 highest
 level
 of
 competi-
tion
 in
 Gaelic
 football
 (National
 League
 Division
 1
 and
 All-Ireland
Championship).
 Data
 were
 collected
 for
 37
 players
 (Mean
 ±
 SD,
 age:
24
 ±
 3
 years;
 height:
 179
 ±
 5
 cm;
 mass:
 79
 ±
 7
 kg)
 over
 one
 season.
The
 study
 was
 approved
 by
 the
 local
 institute’s
 research
 ethics
committee
 and
 written
 informed
 consent
 was
 obtained
 from
 each
participant.
The
 intensity
 of
 all
 competitive
 match-play
 and
 training
 pitch
based
 sessions
 (including
 recovery
 and
 rehabilitation
 sessions)
were
 estimated
 using
 the
 modified
 Borg
 CR-10
 rate
 of
 perceived
exertion
 (RPE)
 scale,
 with
 ratings
 obtained
 from
 each
 individual
player
 within
 30
 min
 of
 completing
 the
 match
 or
 training
 session.16
Each
 player
 was
 asked
 to
 report
 their
 RPE
 for
 each
 session
 confiden-
tially
 without
 knowledge
 of
 other
 players’
 ratings.
 Each
 individual
player’s
 session
 RPE
 in
 arbitrary
 units
 (AU)
 was
 then
 derived
 by
multiplying
 RPE
 and
 session
 duration
 (min).16 Session-RPE
 (sRPE)
has
 previously
 been
 shown
 to
 be
 a
 valid
 method
 for
 estimat-
ing
 exercise
 intensity.17 sRPE
 was
 then
 used
 to
 calculate
 4-week
chronic
 workload
 (i.e.,
 4-week
 average
 acute
 workload).18,19
Maximal
 velocity
 running
 and
 exposure
 to
 maximal
 velocity
during
 all
 sessions
 was
 monitored
 using
 global
 positioning
 system
(GPS)
 technology
 (VXSport,
 Lower
 Hutt,
 New
 Zealand)
 providing
data
 at
 4-Hz.
 Players
 were
 assigned
 individual
 units
 that
 were
 worn
across
 all
 sessions
 to
 account
 for
 any
 inter-unit
 variability.
 Initially
players’
 individual
 maximal
 velocity
 was
 assessed
 during
 a
 max-
imal
 velocity
 test.
 During
 the
 test,
 dual
 beam
 electronic
 timing
gates
 were
 placed
 at
 0-,
 10-,
 20-,
 30-
 and
 40-m
 (Witty,
 Microgate,
Bolzano,
 Italy).
 Speed
 was
 measured
 to
 the
 nearest
 0.01
 s
 with
 the
fastest
 value
 obtained
 from
 3
 trials
 used
 as
 the
 maximal
 velocity
score.
 The
 calculated
 velocity
 between
 the
 20
 and
 40
 m
 gates
 was
used
 as
 a
 measure
 of
 maximal
 velocity.20 The
 intra-class
 correlation
coefficient
 for
 test–retest
 reliability
 and
 typical
 error
 of
 measure-
ment
 for
 the
 10,
 20,
 30
 and
 40
 m
 sprint
 tests
 were
 0.95,
 0.97,
 0.96
and
 0.97
 and
 1.8,
 1.3,
 1.3
 and
 1.2%,
 respectively.
 Analysis
 of
 cal-
culated
 speeds
 revealed
 a
 significant
 correlation
 (r
 =
 0.85,
 p
 =
 0.02)
between
 GPS
 and
 timing
 gate
 measures,
 with
 no
 significant
 differ-
ence
 between
 speeds
 measured
 by
 the
 timing
 gates
 (31.2
 km
 h−1)
and
 GPS
 measures
 (31.0
 km
 h−1)
 (p
 =
 0.842)
 therefore
 allowing
 for
maximal
 velocity
 to
 be
 tracked
 with
 a
 high
 degree
 of
 accuracy
 with
the
 GPS
 system.
 Maximal
 velocity
 exposures
 were
 recorded
 when
a
 player
 covered
 any
 distance
 (m)
 at
 their
 own
 individualised
 max-
imal
 velocity
 (km
 h−1)
 during
 training
 or
 match-play
 events.
 If
 a
player
 produced
 a
 maximum
 velocity
 in
 training
 or
 match-play
that
 exceeded
 the
 test
 value,
 this
 became
 the
 players’
 new
 maxi-
mum  velocity
 for
 the
 period.
 During
 this
 period,
 the
 players’
 ability
to
 produce
 maximal
 velocity
 was
 also
 tracked
 in
 relative
 terms
 by
expressing
 data
 as
 a
 percentage
 of
 their
 maximal
 velocity.
 There-
fore
 during
 this
 observational
 period,
 players’
 number
 of
 maximal
velocity
 exposures,
 the
 distance
 covered
 at
 maximal
 velocity
 and
their
 relative
 maximal
 velocity
 were
 tracked
 over
 weekly
 periods
throughout
 the
 whole
 season
 in
 line
 with
 the
 internal
 and
 exter-
nal
 training
 load
 measures.
 Training
 load
 (sRPE),
 maximal
 velocity
distance,
 the
 number
 of
 maximal
 velocity
 exposures
 and
 the
 per-
centage
 of
 maximal
 velocity
 achieved
 were
 then
 analysed
 across
acute
 1-weekly
 workload
 periods
 (Monday–Sunday).
 Acute
 work-
load
 periods
 were
 compared
 to
 the
 chronic
 training
 load
 over
 the
same
 period
 (previous
 4-week
 average
 acute
 workload).19
All
 GPS
 and
 lower
 limb
 soft
 tissue
 injuries
 were
 classified
 into
acute
 1-weekly
 blocks
 and
 chronic
 4-weekly
 blocks
 using
 a
 bespoke
database.
 Data
 were
 collected
 from
 95
 pitch
 based
 training
 sessions
from
 November
 through
 September.
 Each
 player
 participated
 in
2–3
 pitch
 based
 training
 sessions
 depending
 on
 the
 week
 of
 the
 sea-
son.
 The
 pitch
 based
 training
 sessions
 were
 supplemented
 by
 2
 gym
based,
 strength
 training
 sessions.
 The
 duration
 of
 the
 pitch
 based
training
 sessions
 was
 typically
 between
 60
 and
 130
 min
 depending
on
 session
 goals.
 All
 injuries
 that
 prevented
 a
 player
 from
 taking
full
 part
 in
 all
 training
 and
 match-play
 activities
 typically
 planned
for
 that
 day,
 and
 prevented
 participation
 for
 a
 period
 greater
 than
24
 h
 were
 recorded.
 The
 current
 definition
 of
 injury
 mirrors
 that
employed
 by
 Brooks
 et
 al.21 and
 conforms
 to
 the
 consensus
 time
loss
 injury
 definitions
 proposed
 for
 team
 sport
 athletes.22,23 All
injuries
 were
 further
 classified
 as
 being
 low
 severity
 (1–3
 missed
training
 sessions);
 moderate
 severity
 (player
 was
 unavailable
 for
1–2
 weeks);
 or
 high
 severity
 (player
 missed
 3
 or
 more
 weeks).
Injuries
 were
 also
 categorised
 for
 injury
 type
 (description),
 body
site
 (injury
 location)
 and
 mechanism.2
SPSS

 by

number
 of
 training
 hours
 and
 match
 hours.
 These
 hours
 were
 then
expressed
 as
 a
 rate
 per
 1000
 h.
 The
 95%
 confidence
 intervals
 (CIs)
were
 calculated
 using
 the
 Poisson
 distribution,
 and
 the
 level
 of
significance
 was
 set
 at
 p
 ≤
 0.05.
 Maximal
 velocity
 exposure
 values
and
 injury
 data
 (injury
 vs.
 no
 injury)
 were
 then
 modelled
 using
 a
logistic
 regression
 analysis
 with
 adjustment
 for
 intra-player
 cluster
effects.
 Data
 were
 initially
 split
 into
 quartiles
 (four
 even
 groups),
with
 the
 lowest
 training
 load
 range
 used
 as
 the
 reference
 group.
This
 was
 completed
 for
 relative
 maximal
 velocity,
 weekly
 maxi-
mal
 velocity
 distance
 and
 the
 total
 number
 of
 maximal
 velocity
exposures.
 Additionally,
 to
 better
 understand
 the
 impact
 of
 pre-
vious
 chronic
 training
 load
 on
 maximal
 velocity
 running,
 training
data
 was
 divided
 into
 low
 (≤4750
 AU)
 and
 high
 (≥4750
 AU)
 chronic
training
 load
 groups
 using
 a
 dichotomous
 median
 split.
 Maximal
velocity
 distance,
 maximal
 velocity
 exposures,
 and
 injury
 data
 were
summarised
 at
 the
 completion
 of
 each
 week.
 Acute
 and
 chronic
training
 load
 were
 calculated
 as
 described
 previously.19 Previous
training
 load
 history
 was
 then
 associated
 with
 players’
 tolerance
 to
maximal
 velocity
 distance,
 maximal
 velocity
 exposures
 and
 injuries
sustained
 in
 the
 subsequent
 week.
 Players
 who
 sustained
 an
 injury
were
 removed
 from
 analysis
 until
 they
 were
 medically
 cleared
 to
return
 to
 full
 training.
 Odds
 ratios
 (OR)
 were
 calculated
 to
 deter-
mine
 the
 injury
 risk
 at
 a
 given
 relative
 percentage
 of
 maximal
velocity,
 chronic
 training
 load,
 number
 of
 maximal
 velocity
 expo-
sures,
 and
 distance
 covered
 (m)
 at
 maximal
 velocity.
 When
 an
 OR
was
 greater
 than
 1,
 an
 increased
 risk
 of
 injury
 was
 reported
 (i.e.,
OR
 =
 1.50
 is
 indicative
 of
 a
 50%
 increased
 risk)
 and
 vice
 versa.
 Based
on
 a
 total
 of
 91
 injuries
 from
 3515
 player-sessions,
 the
 calculated
statistical
 power
 to
 establish
 the
 relationship
 between
 running
loads
 and
 soft-tissue
 injuries
 was
 85%.
3.
 Results
In
 total,
 91
 time-loss
 injuries
 were
 reported
 across
 the
 season
(36
 training
 injuries
 and
 55
 match
 injuries).
 A
 rate
 of
 2.4
 injuries
per
 player
 was
 observed.
 Overall,
 match
 injury
 incidence
 was
45.3/1000
 h
 (95%
 CI:
 41.9–53.8)
 with
 a
 training
 injury
 incidence
 of
6.9/1000
 h
 (95%
 CI:
 5.8–7.8).
 The
 total
 match
 and
 training
 volumes
reported
 during
 the
 season
 were
 1210
 h
 and
 5975
 h
 respectively.
Players
 who
 produced
 over
 95%
 maximal
 velocity
 within
 train-
ing
 and
 match-play
 environments
 in
 the
 preceding
 week
 had
 a
lower
 risk
 of
 injury
 than
 those
 who
 produced
 lower
 maximal
 veloc-
ity
 (OR:
 0.12,
 95%
 CI
 0.01–0.92,
 p
 =
 0.001)
 (Table
 1).
 On
 average,
players
 were
 exposed
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 7
 ±
 4
 times
 during
 match
play
 and
 training
 environments;
 specifically
 players
 experienced
4
 ±

 during

 Discussion
The
 current
 investigation
 is
 the
 first
 to
 explore
 the
 relation-
ship
 between
 training
 load,
 maximal
 velocity
 exposures
 and
 injury
risk
 in
 elite
 Gaelic
 football
 players.
 Our
 data
 showed
 that
 when
players’
 produced
 over
 95%
 of
 their
 maximal
 velocity
 they
 were
 at
reduced
 risk
 of
 subsequent
 injury
 (OR:
 0.12)
 (Table
 1).
 When
 maxi-
mal  velocity
 exposures
 were
 considered
 independently
 of
 training
load
 history
 a
 U-shaped
 curve
 was
 shown
 for
 number
 of
 expo-
sures
 and
 subsequent
 injury
 risk
 (see
 Supplementary
 Fig.
 S1
 in
the
 online
 version
 at
 doi:
 10.1016/j.jsams.2016.08.005).
 Interest-
ingly,
 the
 number
 of
 exposures
 required
 to
 offer
 a
 “vaccine”
 for
subsequent
 injuries
 was
 related
 to
 the
 previous
 chronic
 load
 per-
formed
 by
 players.
 The
 current
 investigation
 showed
 that
 a
 higher
chronic
 training
 load
 (≥4750
 AU)
 allows
 greater
 exposure
 to
 maxi-
mal  velocity
 running
 which
 in
 turn
 offers
 a
 protective
 effect
 against
injury.
 However,
 players
 with
 a
 low
 chronic
 load
 (≤
 4750
 AU)
 were
at
 increased
 injury
 risk
 at
 similar
 maximal
 velocity
 exposures.
 Our
data
 highlight
 that
 the
 ability
 to
 expose
 players
 to
 their
 maximal
velocity
 is
 a
 function
 of
 their
 chronic
 training
 load
 history
 with
maximal
 velocity
 exposure
 protective
 for
 players
 when
 combined
with
 higher
 training
 loads.
 Practically,
 our
 data
 suggest
 that
 players
should
 be
 exposed
 to
 periods
 of
 training
 that
 best
 prepare
 them
 to
attain
 higher
 velocity
 movements.
Our
 study
 is
 the
 first
 to
 investigate
 the
 impact
 of
 maximal
 veloc-
ity
 exposure
 on
 subsequent
 injury
 risk
 in
 an
 elite
 cohort
 of
 Gaelic
football
 players.
 We  observed
 that
 players
 who
 produced
 ≥95%
of
 their
 maximal
 velocity
 were
 at
 reduced
 injury
 risk
 compared
to
 players
 who
 produced
 lower
 relative
 maximal
 velocities
 (OR:
0.12).
 In
 addition,
 our
 findings
 suggest
 that
 players
 with
 moder-
ate
 exposures
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 (>6–10)
 were
 at
 reduced
 injury
risk
 compared
 to
 players
 who
 experienced
 lower
 (<5)
 exposures
(OR:
 0.24).
 Conversely,
 players
 who
 experienced
 maximal
 veloc-
ity
 exposures
 of
 >10
 were
 at
 a
 significantly
 higher
 risk
 of
 injury
compared
 to
 the
 reference
 group.
 The
 current
 data
 suggests
 that
moderate
 exposure
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 running
 can
 protect
 play-
ers
 from
 subsequent
 injury
 risk.
 Previous
 literature
 has
 supported
the
 fact
 that
 a
 moderate
 exposure
 to
 high
 intensity
 periods
 can
offer
 a
 protective
 effect
 for
 team
 sport
 players.
 Colby
 et
 al.9 high-
lighted
 that
 players
 who
 covered
 moderate
 3-week
 sprint
 distances
(864–1453
 m)  had
 lower
 injury
 risk
 compared
 to
 lower
 and
 higher
volume
 groups.
 Our
 findings
 support
 the
 exposure
 of
 players
 to
these
 maximal
 efforts
 within
 training
 situations
 to
 ensure
 they
 are
adequately
 prepared
 for
 critical
 moments
 of
 match-play.
We  found
 that
 players
 with
 higher
 chronic
 loads
 (≥4750
 AU)
experienced
 increased
 exposures
 to
 maximal
 velocity,
 with
 this
increase
 in
 exposure
 offering
 a
 protective
 effect
 against
 injury.
This
 might
 be
 explained
 by
 these
 players
 being
 exposed
 to
previous
 training
 load
 that
 improved
 their
 ability
 to
 tolerate
subsequent
 load,
 ultimately
 reducing
 their
 risk
 of
 injury.
 In
 con-
trast,
 players
 with
 low
 chronic
 loads
 where
 at
 greater
 risk
 of
injury
 when
 exposed
 to
 the
 same
 number
 of
 maximal
 veloc-
ity
 exposures,
 perhaps
 reflecting
 the
 consequences
 of
 inadequate
exposure
 to
 a
 sufficient
 workload
 over
 the
 previous
 period.
 Our
results
 are
 in
 line
 with
 previous
 investigations
 from
 rugby
 league
that
 have
 suggested
 that
 higher
 chronic
 loads
 protect
 against
injury.10 Therefore
 coaches
 should
 consider
 that
 the
 prescrip-
tion
 of
 training
 that
 emphasises
 reductions
 in
 training
 load
 may
actually
 increase
 athlete’s
 susceptibility
 to
 injury
 due
 to
 inad-
equate
 chronic
 loads
 and
 fitness
 levels.6,24 However,
 coaches
need
 to
 be
 aware
 that
 high
 chronic
 workloads,
 combined
 with
large
 spikes
 in
 acute
 workload
 have
 previously
 demonstrated
the
 greatest
 risk
 of
 injury
 in
 team
 sport
 players10;
 this
 would
appear
 to
 be
 an
 important
 consideration
 when
 increasing
 train-
ing
 loads
 in
 order
 to
 return
 players
 to
 competitive
 play.25 Coaches
should
 be
 aware
 that
 although
 exposure
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 has
a
 protective
 effect,
 players
 with
 higher
 chronic
 training
 loads
are
 better
 prepared
 to
 tolerate
 subsequent
 maximal
 velocity
load.
The
 current
 data
 has
 shown
 that
 depending
 on
 previous
chronic
 training
 load
 status
 players
 can
 tolerate
 more
 intense
periods
 of
 training.
 Players
 with
 higher
 chronic
 training
 loads
were
 able
 to
 cover
 increased
 weekly
 distances
 (120–150
 m)
 at
maximal
 velocity
 with
 lower
 subsequent
 injury
 risk
 (OR:
 0.26).
Interestingly
 players
 with
 lower
 chronic
 loads
 were
 at
 increased
risk
 of
 subsequent
 injury
 (OR:
 3.12)
 at
 the
 same
 weekly
 run-
ning
 load
 (120–150
 m).
 The
 current
 data
 provides
 information
that
 advocates
 players
 covering
 moderate
 distance
 at
 their
 indi-
vidual
 maximal
 velocity.
 Coaches
 must
 be
 aware
 that
 players
need
 to
 have
 the
 necessary
 physical
 qualities
 in
 order
 to
 toler-
ate
 the
 exposures
 to
 maximal
 running
 volumes6 as
 highlighted
by
 the
 difference
 between
 low
 and
 high
 chronic
 load
 groupings.
This
 is
 supported
 by
 previous
 observations8 which
 found
 that
players
 who
 covered
 more
 distance
 at
 very-high
 speed
 (>9
 m)
suffered
 less
 time
 loss
 from
 injury
 when
 compared
 to
 those
who
 covered
 less
 than
 9
 m.
 Finally,
 those
 players
 who
 covered
greater
 absolute
 distances
 at
 high-speeds
 (>190
 m)
 missed
 fewer
matches
 than
 players
 who
 covered
 less
 distance
 at
 the
 same
thresholds.8
There
 are
 some
 limitations
 of
 this
 study
 that
 should
 be
 con-
sidered.
 Firstly,
 all
 conditioning
 workloads
 (cross-training
 and
strength
 training)
 cannot
 be
 quantified
 through
 the
 use
 of
 GPS
technology.
 Research
 incorporating
 these
 objective
 measures
 with
RPE-values
 and
 other
 data
 such
 as
 perceived
 muscle
 soreness,
fatigue,
 mood,
 and
 sleep
 ratings2,26,27 may
 provide
 additional
insight
 into
 the
 training
 load–injury
 relationship
 of
 elite
 Gaelic
football
 players.
 Additionally,
 we  acknowledge
 that
 the
 play-
ers’
 injury
 history
 was
 not
 considered
 and
 is
 recognised
 as
an
 important
 factor
 in
 subsequent
 injury
 incidence.6,26 Finally
although
 acceptable
 validity
 and
 accuracy
 was
 reported
 for
 the
specific
 GPS
 units
 used
 within
 the
 current
 study,
 it
 should
be
 noted
 that
 previous
 research
 has
 questioned
 the
 accuracy
of
 GPS
 for
 the
 measurement
 of
 high
 speed
 movements.28 To
reduce
 injury
 risk
 in
 Gaelic
 football
 the
 application
 of
 maxi-
mal
 velocity
 exposures,
 relative
 maximal
 velocity
 and
 distance
covered
 at
 maximal
 velocity
 should
 be
 considered
 when
 moni-
toring
 and
 modifying
 players
 weekly
 workload
 on
 an
 individual
basis.

 Conclusion
In
 conclusion
 when
 maximal
 velocity
 exposures
 were
 consid-
ered
 independently
 of
 training
 load
 history
 a
 U-shaped
 curve
 was
shown
 for
 number
 of
 exposures
 and
 subsequent
 injury
 risk.
 Our
data
 suggests
 that
 players
 who
 produce
 ≥95%
 of
 their
 maximal
velocity
 were
 at
 reduced
 injury
 risk
 compared
 to
 players
 who
 pro-
duced
 lower
 relative
 maximal
 velocities.
 Coaches
 should
 expose
players
 to
 high
 percentages
 of
 maximal
 velocity
 within
 training
 sit-
uations
 as
 this
 offers
 a
 potential
 “vaccine”
 against
 subsequent
 soft
tissue
 injury.
 Players
 with
 higher
 chronic
 training
 loads
 (≥4750
 AU)
were
 able
 to
 cover
 increased
 weekly
 distances
 (120–150
 m)
 at
 max-
imal
 velocity
 with
 lower
 subsequent
 injury
 risk,
 while
 players
 with
lower
 chronic
 loads
 were
 at
 increased
 risk
 of
 subsequent
 injury
 at
the
 same
 weekly
 running
 load.
 Coaches
 should
 be
 aware
 that
 play-
ers
 need
 to
 partake
 in
 hard
 but
 well
 planned
 training
 to
 be
 protected
from
 subsequent
 injury.
 Finally,
 our
 findings
 suggest
 that
 expo-
sure
 of
 players
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 running
 should
 be
 mainstream
practice
 in
 elite
 sport
 in
 order
 to
 adequately
 prepare
 players
 for
the
 demands
 of
 competition.
 Coaches
 should
 modify
 drills
 within
training
 to
 allow
 players
 to
 be
 exposed
 to
 their
 maximal
 velocity
 or
incorporate
 linear
 based
 running
 over
 a
 distance
 that
 allows
 players
to
 attain
 these
 maximal
 velocities
 within
 the
 training
 environment.

Practical
 applications
• Exposure
 of
 players
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 running
 should
 be
 main-
stream
 practice
 in
 elite
 sport
 in
 order
 to
 adequately
 prepare
players
 for
 maximal
 velocity
 situations
 during
 match-play.
• Coaches
 should
 allow
 for
 situations
 within
 training
 where
 play-
ers
 can
 achieve
 high
 percentages
 of
 maximal
 velocity
 as
 these
situations
 offer
 a
 potential
 protective
 effect
 against
 injury.
• Players
 who
 produce
 ≥95%
 of
 their
 maximal
 velocity
 are
 at
reduced
 injury
 risk
 compared
 to
 players
 who
 produced
 lower
relative
 maximal
 velocities.
• Players
 with
 higher
 chronic
 training
 loads
 were
 able
 to
 achieve
greater
 exposures
 to
 maximal
 velocity
 running
 at
 reduced
 risk.
Therefore,
 physically
 hard
 but
 well
 planned
 training
 seems
 an
effective
 approach
 of
 preparing
 players
 for
 maximal
 velocity
components
 of
 training.
