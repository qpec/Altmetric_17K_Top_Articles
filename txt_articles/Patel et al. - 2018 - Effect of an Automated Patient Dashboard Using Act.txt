Abstract
IMPORTANCE Statins are not prescribed to approximately 50% of patients who could benefit
from them.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of an automated patient dashboard using active choice
framing with and without peer comparison feedback on performance to nudge primary care
physicians (PCPs) to increase guideline-concordant statin prescribing.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 3-arm cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted
from February 21, 2017, to April 21, 2017, at 32 practice sites in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
Participants included 96 PCPs and 4774 patients not previously receiving statin therapy. Data were
analyzed from April 25, 2017, to June 16, 2017.
INTERVENTIONS Primary care physicians in the 2 intervention arms were emailed a link to an
automated online dashboard listing their patients who met national guidelines for statin therapy but
had not been prescribed this medication. The dashboard included relevant patient information, and
for each patient, PCPs were asked to make an active choice to prescribe atorvastatin, 20 mg, once
daily, atorvastatin at another dose, or another statin or not prescribe a statin and select a reason. The
dashboard was available for 2 months. In 1 intervention arm, the email to PCPs also included
feedback on their statin prescribing rate compared with their peers. Primary care physicians in the
usual care group received no interventions.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Statin prescription rates.
RESULTS Patients had a mean (SD) age of 62.4 (8.3) years and a mean (SD) 10-year atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease risk score of 13.6 (8.2); 2625 (55.0%) were male, 3040 (63.7%) were white,
and 1318 (27.6%) were black. In the active choice arm, 16 of 32 PCPs (50.0%) accessed the patient
dashboard, but only 2 of 32 (6.3%) signed statin prescription orders. In the active choice with peer
comparison arm, 12 of 32 PCPs (37.5%) accessed the patient dashboard and 8 of 32 (25.0%) signed
statin prescription orders. Statins were prescribed in 40 of 1566 patients (2.6%) in the usual care
arm, 116 of 1743 (6.7%) in the active choice arm, and 117 of 1465 (8.0%) in the active choice with peer
comparison arm. In the main adjusted model, compared with usual care, there was a significant
increase in statin prescribing in the active choice with peer comparison arm (adjusted difference in
percentage points, 5.8; 95% CI, 0.9-13.5; P = .008), but not in the active choice arm (adjusted
difference in percentage points, 4.1; 95% CI, −0.8 to 13.1; P = .11).

Key Points
Question Can an automated patient
dashboard and nudges to physicians
increase guideline-appropriate statin
prescription rates among patients who
were not previously receiving
statin therapy?
Findings In this cluster randomized
clinical trial of 96 primary care
physicians from 32 practice sites
including 4774 patients, an automated
patient dashboard using active choice

led to a modest but significant increase
in guideline-appropriate statin
prescribing rates compared with
usual care.
Meaning Nudges to physicians offer an
effective, low-cost, and scalable
approach to increase use of automated
patient dashboards to improve
guideline-concordant prescribing
behaviors, but these approaches may
need to be designed to better fit within
clinician workflow or be combined with
other approaches to further increase
their impact.

TRIAL REGISTRATION ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03021759

Introduction
Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the
United States.1,2 Statins, or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are
generally well tolerated and have been demonstrated to lower the risk of cardiovascular events and
mortality by approximately 30%.3-5 However, despite their clinical utility and established national
guidelines,3,6 clinicians fail to prescribe them to approximately 50% of patients who could benefit
from them.7-11
The traditional approach for clinicians to identify patients eligible for statins is by individually
recognizing that a patient meets clinical criteria. Even when systems are automated, reminders are
typically provided at the time of a visit. This approach often leads to delays or failures in care because
some patients visit their physician infrequently and because preventive services may not be
discussed if there are acute issues or limited time.
An automated dashboard of patients eligible for statin therapy could address many of these
challenges. Dashboards could help clinicians identify gaps in care for an entire panel of patients,
untethered from the timing of individual visits. Many health systems are already using such
dashboards to provide feedback to clinicians on variations in care. However, the association of these
dashboards with patient outcomes has not been well examined. A key challenge in this approach is
that clinicians must both use the dashboard and act on it for it to lead to improvements in health.
Nudges could be targeted to clinicians to engage them in using these dashboards to improve
the delivery of care.12,13 For example, clinicians could be prompted to review a list of eligible patients
and make an active choice whether or not to prescribe statins. Active choice is a method used to
address delays in decision making by prompting an immediate decision between alternative
choices.13-15 In previous observational studies,16,17 we demonstrated how active choice delivered to
physicians through the electronic health record (EHR) during patient interactions significantly
increased ordering of influenza vaccination, colonoscopy, and mammography. In addition, health
systems could deliver feedback to clinicians informing them how their performance compares with
other peers in their network,18 which has been used in a variety of contexts to motivate better
performance, including reducing inappropriate antibiotic prescribing.19-21
In this cluster randomized clinical trial, our objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of an
automated patient dashboard using active choice framing with and without peer comparison
feedback on performance to nudge primary care physicians (PCPs) to prescribe guideline-
appropriate statins for patients who were not previously receiving statin therapy. The trial was
implemented in a pragmatic fashion to inform health systems’efforts to redesign approaches to
better manage populations of patients.
Methods
Study Design
The Pragmatic Randomized Evaluation of Statin Active Choice to Reach Improved Outcomes Based
on Evidence (PRESCRIBE) was a 3-arm cluster randomized clinical trial conducted among PCPs from
32 clinics at the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS). The trial was conducted during a

 2-month period between February 21, 2017, and April 21, 2017, and compared new statin prescription
rates for usual care with PCPs receiving an active choice intervention with and without peer
comparison performance feedback. The study protocol was approved by the University of
Pennsylvania institutional review board. The trial protocol can be found in Supplement 1. Informed
consent by physicians and patients was waived because this was a pragmatic evaluation of a health
system initiative that posed minimal risk. Neither physicians nor patients were compensated for
participation. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting
guideline.
Study Sample
Data on PCPs from the UPHS and their patients were obtained from the EHR using the reporting
database Clarity (Epic). The PCPs at the UPHS were eligible if they had at least 10 patients who met
the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for statin therapy,3
including any form of clinical ASCVD, most recent low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level
of 190 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) or greater, age 40 to 75 years
with diabetes and LDL-C level of 70 to 189 mg/dL, and age 40 to 75 years with an estimated 10-year
ASCVD risk score22 of 7.5% or greater. Nurse practitioners and resident physicians were excluded.
Patients were eligible if they had a PCP at the UPHS, met the 2013 American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for statin therapy,3 and had no documentation of
a previous statin prescription in our EHR. Patients were excluded if they had stage 4 or 5 chronic
kidney disease with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 30 mL/min or less, a documented allergy to
statins, or previous adverse reaction to statins, including myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or hepatitis.
Randomization
The PCPs were electronically randomized to a study arm using block sizes of 3. Randomization was
stratified on quartile of PCP baseline statin prescribing rates before entry into the trial to ensure both
a range of baseline PCP prescribing rates within each arm and a balance across study arms. All
investigators, statisticians, and data analysts were blinded to arm assignments until the study and
analysis were completed.
Interventions
The PCPs and patients in usual care received no communications or interventions from the trial. In
both active choice intervention arms, each PCP received an email from the study team that indicated
the number of his or her patients who met guidelines for statin therapy but had not been prescribed
a statin. The email provided the PCP with a link to a dashboard on a secure website that listed each of
these patients along with their age, sex, and the following data as available from the EHR: 10-year
ASCVD risk score, most recent LDL-C level, other lipid levels (ie, total cholesterol, high-density
lipoprotein, and triglycerides), body mass index, history of smoking and any form of clinical ASCVD
(eg, myocardial infarction or stroke), liver function tests (normal or slightly elevated), and medical
record number (for EHR lookup if warranted). The PCPs were asked to review the list of patients
within 1 week and use the dashboard to select whether or not to prescribe each patient a statin. The
dashboard provided an overview of the study, a link to the American College of Cardiology/
American Heart Association guidelines, and options for selecting statin dosage (eFigure 1 and
eFigure 2 in Supplement 2). The PCPs could either click a button at the top of the dashboard that
would select atorvastatin, 20 mg, once daily for all patients or individually review and select choices
for each patient from among the following 4 options: (1) atorvastatin statin, 20 mg, once daily; (2)
atorvastatin at another dose; (3) another statin (choice of simvastatin, pravastatin, or rosuvastatin
doses); or (4) don’
t prescribe, in which case the PCP had to select 1 of the following reasons: patient
not eligible, patient declined, adverse effect or allergy not listed in Epic, drug interaction, risks
outweigh benefits, or other.

 In the peer comparison arm, the email to PCPs also included performance feedback on their
baseline statin prescribing rates prior to entry in the trial compared with their peers (eFigure 3 and
eFigure 4 in Supplement 2). The PCPs below the median were informed of how they compared with
the median (eg, your statin prescribing rate: 50%; average of your peers at Penn: 64%). The PCPs
above the median but below the 90th percentile were informed how they compared with the 90th
percentile or top performers (eg, your statin prescribing rate: 70%; your top-performing peers at
Penn: 85%). The PCPs at or above the 90th percentile were not given comparison data and instead
informed of their high performance (among your peer physicians at Penn, you are a top performer.
Great job!). This design was based on evidence that social norming interventions are more effective
when combined with an injunctive norm that infers a social approval or disapproval.23 The tiered
approach provides 90% of PCPs with comparisons with others with better performance (rather than
sending everyone a comparison with the median), which may encourage behavior toward
improvement and prevent regression to the mean or lowest performer.24
The PCPs in the intervention arms received up to 2 email reminders over the next 2 weeks, and
the dashboard remained available for 2 months. The PCPs could save their work and return later or
finalize and submit selections. Once submitted, a study coordinator templated an order for the
medication in the EHR and sent the PCP an email when the prescription was ready to be
electronically signed. Once the prescription was signed, the study coordinator mailed the patient a
letter informing him or her of the PCP’
s decision to prescribe a statin, the location of the pharmacy to
which the prescription had been sent, the risks and benefits of statins, and a recommendation for a
follow-up visit with the PCP within 6 months (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2).
Outcome Measures
The primary outcome was the change in the percentage of eligible patients prescribed a statin. This
measure was evaluated during the 2-month intervention period.
Statistical Analysis
A priori power calculations were based on an initial review of existing EHR data that revealed a 65%
baseline statin prescribing rate, a median of 38 eligible patients per PCP but not yet prescribed a
statin, and an intracluster correlation for patients prescribed a statin within a PCP panel of 0.026.
Based on these assumptions, we estimated that a sample of 84 PCPs (28 per arm) would provide at
least 90% power to detect a 10% difference between each of the arms using a conservative
Bonferroni adjustment of the type I error rate with a 2-sided α of .017. We increased the PCP
enrollment target to 96 to account for a potential 15% dropout rate.
All randomly assigned PCPs and their patients were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.
For each patient, we used the EHR to identify whether a statin had been prescribed by the end of the
2-month study period. In the main adjusted analysis, we used the PROC GENMOD feature in SAS (SAS
Institute Inc) to fit models based on generalized estimating equations with a logit link and an
independence correlation structure using PCP as the clustering unit.25 To test the robustness of our
findings, we conducted a sensitivity analysis in which the main model was estimated by adjusting for
patient characteristics, including age, sex, race/ethnicity, insurance type, median annual household
income by zip code, Charlson comorbidity index score,26 body mass index, most recent LDL-C level
measurement, 10-year ASCVD risk score,22 clinical ASCVD, congestive heart failure, diabetes,
hypertension, and smoking history, as well as PCP panel size. In post hoc exploratory analyses, the
sensitivity model was further adjusted for PCP degree and using interaction terms of the study arm
variables with race/ethnicity and separately with insurance type.
To obtain the adjusted difference and 95% confidence intervals in the percentage of patients
prescribed a statin between arms, we used the bootstrap method,27,28 resampling patients 1000
times. Resampling of patients was conducted by a PCP panel to maintain clustering at the PCP level.
All analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).

 Results
Ninety-six PCPs from 32 primary care clinics and 4774 patients were randomized (Figure). The PCPs
differed slightly across arms for type of medical degree, but all other characteristics were well
balanced (Table 1). The mean (SD) baseline statin prescribing percentage before the trial was 63.5%
(10.3%), and a mean (SD) of 49.7 (41.0) patients were enrolled per PCP. The patient sample had a
mean (SD) age of 62.4 (8.3) years, 2625 (55.0%) were male, 3040 (63.7%) were white, and 1318
(27.6%) were black. The mean (SD) 10-year ASCVD risk score was 13.6 (8.2); 2769 (58.0%) had
hypertension, 2049 (42.9%) had a history of smoking, and 1201 (25.2%) had diabetes. Patients
differed slightly across arms in a few sociodemographic and baseline characteristics but were mostly
well balanced (Table 2).
In the active choice arm, 16 of 32 PCPs (50.0%) accessed the patient dashboard, and 4 of 32
(12.5%) submitted statin prescriptions through the dashboard, but only 2 of 32 (6.3%) signed statin
prescription orders in the EHR. In the active choice with peer comparison arm, 12 of 32 PCPs (37.5%)
accessed the patient dashboard, 8 of 32 (25.0%) submitted statin prescriptions through the
dashboard, and 8 of 32 (25.0%) signed statin prescription orders in the EHR.
During the intervention, the percentage of patients prescribed a statin was 2.6% (40 of 1566)
in the usual care arm, 6.7% (116 of 1743) in the active choice arm, and 8.0% (117 of 1465) in the active
choice with peer comparison arm. In the main adjusted model, compared with usual care, there was
a significant difference in statin prescribing in the active choice with peer comparison arm (adjusted
difference in percentage points, 5.8; 95% CI, 0.9-13.5; P = .008), but not in the active choice arm
(adjusted difference in percentage points, 4.1; 95% CI, −0.8 to 13.1; P = .11). These findings were
similar in sensitivity analyses that also adjusted for patient characteristics and PCP panel size
(Table 3).

 comparison arm. These differences are likely owing to greater use of the active choice dashboard by
PCPs whose patient panels included greater proportions of patients who were black and/or had
Medicaid insurance (eTable 1, eTable 2, and eTable 3 in Supplement 2). In adjusted models including
interaction terms for race/ethnicity and insurance and adjusting for PCP degree, results were similar
to the main adjusted model (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). No adverse events were reported during
the trial.
Discussion
Providing physicians with an automated dashboard of patients eligible for statins was most effective
at increasing statin prescription rates when using nudges that combined active choice framing in the
dashboard with a 1-time email including peer comparison feedback on performance. The same
intervention without peer comparison feedback resulted in statin prescription rates that were higher
than usual care, but there was not enough power to detect a statistically significant difference.
Our findings reveal several important implications for future intervention design. First, our
findings add to the growing literature on using patient dashboards to change physician behavior. A
trial by Rat et al29 generated a list of patients due for colorectal cancer screening and found that
sending the list to physicians led to a significant increase in screening. However, the patient list was
sent by mail and may be less scalable than approaches that leverage technology. The list was also not
actionable without manual effort from the physician or practice. The intervention in our study was
conducted outside of the EHR to test its effect and optimize the design. However, future studies
could test ways to implement an active choice patient dashboard within the EHR to better integrate
within clinicians’workflow.
Second, a key element of our intervention design was the use of insights from behavioral
economics to design choice architecture, specifically through active choice framing. In prior
observational studies,16,17 we found that active choice could be used to increase clinician ordering of
preventive services, including influenza vaccination, colonoscopy, and mammography. In this trial,
physicians could review patients using the automated patient dashboard and make decisions on
statin prescriptions, either in bulk or individually. By offering multiple options to prescribe a
guideline-indicated statin and requiring a reason to say no, clinicians may be nudged toward
prescribing a statin.30,31 The pragmatic manner in which these approaches were implemented
demonstrates how a learning health care system could take a systematic approach to testing nudges
in health care.32
Third, peer comparison feedback delivered just once by email was effective at increasing
physician engagement with the automated patient dashboard. Compared with active choice alone,
the addition of peer comparison feedback increased the number of physicians submitting
prescriptions through the dashboard (25% vs 13%) and the number who actually prescribed statins
through the EHR (25% vs 6%). A trial by Meeker et al19 that tested behavioral interventions to lower
unnecessary antibiotic prescribing also found that socially motivated interventions, such as
accountable justification and peer comparison, were successful, but suggested alternatives—an
approach that was not socially motivated—were not. Despite the differences in statin prescription
rates in our study, physician engagement with the dashboard was low. Informal feedback from
physicians suggested this may have been because notifications came from the research team rather
than clinical leadership or practice managers. In addition, the intervention was low touch in that the
physicians received only 1 email with up to 2 reminders. These issues could be addressed in future
studies that compare different designs or frequencies of peer comparison feedback and their effect
on prescribing behaviors.
Fourth, health care systems are looking for strategies to better manage populations of patients.
We enabled physicians to prescribe statins outside of traditional office visits with the patient. This
approach is proactive in that it does not require waiting for a patient to come to the clinic to make a
decision. It also might optimize future clinic visits by removing the identification of eligible patients

 and process of prescribing so that the physician and patient can focus more on other aspects of care.
It is also relatively low cost and therefore more scalable than other approaches. However, the
approach does present some challenges. Physicians with larger patient panels may face difficulties
managing these types of decisions outside of their traditional clinic model when they receive a long
list of eligible patients at 1 time without additional support. Future interventions could consider a drip
model in which physicians are delivered peer comparison feedback monthly over a longer period,
thereby providing multiple opportunities to address gaps in care for smaller subsets of patients.
While the effects were statistically significant, they were modest. These interventions would
likely fit better within physician workflow if deployed through the EHR rather than alongside it.
Indeed, we had wanted to create the dashboard in such a way that making a decision for a patient
would automatically generate and sign a prescription order through the EHR. However, by first
testing different forms of nudges, we could optimize the design of the intervention before
implementing and scaling it within the EHR, which involves the additional time and expense of
programming new functionality. Had that connection been seamless, as it would be in a more
integrated system, statin prescription rates would likely have been higher.
Limitations
Our study had limitations. First, physicians and patients were from a single health care system, which
may limit generalizability. However, our sample included 32 different practice sites from 2 states.
Second, we did not inform physicians in the control arm that they were part of a trial. While in other
settings one might want to control for the Hawthorne effect, in this case the potentially greater sense
of being observed in the intervention group reflects the reality of these interventions in their
practical application outside of research settings and so the result is a more pragmatic comparison.
Third, it is possible that some patients were previously prescribed a statin at another health care
system that was not captured by our EHR; however, since the randomization was well balanced, it is
likely that these types of patients were also balanced across arms. None of the patients in the trial
were already actively taking a statin. Fourth, we evaluated statin prescription rates but did not have
data on prescription fill rates. Fifth, given the study design, we were unable to isolate the effects of
the peer comparison feedback alone. Sixth, our intervention was 2 months in duration, and further
study is needed to assess the effects of longer interventions.
Conclusions
We found that an automated patient dashboard using nudges that combined active choice framing
with peer comparison feedback led to a modest but significant increase in statin prescribing rates.
Our findings demonstrate the potential of using insights from behavioral economics in highly
automated systems to nudge physicians toward guideline-concordant prescribing.
