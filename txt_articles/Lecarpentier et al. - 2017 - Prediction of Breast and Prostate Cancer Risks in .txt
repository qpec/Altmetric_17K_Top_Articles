Purpose
BRCA1/2 mutations increase the risk of breast and prostate cancer in men. Common genetic variants
modify cancer risks for female carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. We investigated—for the first time to our
knowledge—associations of common genetic variants with breast and prostate cancer risks for male
carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations and implications for cancer risk prediction.
Materials and Methods
Wegenotyped1,802malecarriers ofBRCA1/2mutations from theConsortium of Investigatorsof Modifiers
of BRCA1/2 by using the custom Illumina OncoArray. We investigated the combined effects of established
breast and prostate cancer susceptibility variants on cancer risks for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations by
constructing weighted polygenic risk scores (PRSs) using published effect estimates as weights.
Results
In male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, PRS that was based on 88 female breast cancer susceptibility
variants was associated with breast cancer risk (odds ratioper standard deviation of PRS, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.19
to 1.56; P = 8.6 3 1026). Similarly, PRS that was based on 103 prostate cancer susceptibility variants was
associated with prostate cancer risk (odds ratio per SD of PRS, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.35 to 1.81; P = 3.2 3 1029).
Large differences in absolute cancer risks were observed at the extremes of the PRS distribution. For
example, prostate cancer risk by age 80 years at the 5th and 95th percentiles of the PRS varies from 7% to
26% for carriers of BRCA1 mutations and from 19% to 61% for carriers of BRCA2 mutations, respectively.
Conclusion
PRSs may provide informative cancer risk stratification for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations that
might enable these men and their physicians to make informed decisions on the type and timing of
breast and prostate cancer risk management.

 INTRODUCTION
Germline mutations in BRCA1 and, predominantly, BRCA2 are
associated with increased risks in men of developing breast and
prostate cancers.1,2 BRCA1/2 mutations account for approximately
10% of male breast cancer and 2% of prostate cancer cases.3-5
Breast cancer in men is rare and accounts for less than 1% of all
male tumors. By contrast, prostate cancer is the most common
cancer in men, accounting for approximately 25% of male tu-
mors.6 The lifetime risk of male breast cancer in mutation carriers
has been estimated to be 5% to 10% and 1% to 5% for carriers of
BRCA2 and BRCA1 mutations, respectively, whereas estimates of
lifetime prostate cancer risk are approximately 20% and 40% for
carriers of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations, respectively.3,7-10
More than 100 common genetic variants (single nucleotide
polymorphisms [SNPs]) that are associated with prostate cancer
and female breast cancer have been identified via genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) in the general population,11,12 and
their combined effects have been shown to have significant im-
plications for risk stratification and targeted prevention.13-15 By
contrast, only two male breast cancer susceptibility SNPs have been
identified to date,16 but there is some evidence that suggests that
common variants that are associated with female breast cancer may
influence male breast cancer risk.17-19
Studies by the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of
BRCA1/2 (CIMBA) have shown that common SNPs modify the
risk of breast and ovarian cancers for female BRCA1 and BRCA2
mutation carriers20-22; however, no study to date has investigated
the associations of common SNPs with breast or prostate cancer
risk for men with BRCA1/2 mutations and their implications for
cancer risk prediction.
In this study, we performed the first GWAS for breast and
prostate cancers in male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers enrolled in
CIMBA using the custom Illumina OncoArray. Furthermore, we
evaluated the combined effects of known common breast and
prostate cancer susceptibility variants on cancer risks for male
carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations and estimated absolute age-specific
cumulative risks of developing breast and prostate cancers on the
basis of combined SNP distributions. We demonstrate—to our
knowledge for the first time—that combined SNP effects have
important implications for risk profiling of male carriers of
BRCA1/2 mutations.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Samples
CIMBA collects data on men with BRCA1 or BRCA2 clearly path-
ogenic variants—commonly termed mutations—who are older than 18 years,
with the majority recruited via cancer genetics clinics.23 Pathogenic variants
were defined as previously described.24 All participating studies have been
approved by local ethical review committees.
To select samples for genotyping, we used a case-control study design,
selecting all available male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations who were af-
fected with breast and/or prostate cancer (cases) and matching them with
up to three unaffected mutation carriers (controls). Cases and controls
were matched for study group or country of residence, year of birth, and
gene (BRCA1 or BRCA2). A total of 1,989 male carriers were selected for
genotyping: 265 with breast cancer, 212 with prostate cancer, 43 with both
diseases, and 1,469 unaffected.
Genotyping and Quality Control
Genotyping was performed by using the Illumina OncoArray
beadchip (approximately 570,000 SNPs with genome-wide coverage).
Genotyping and quality control were performed as described in the Data
Supplement. Of 1,989 samples, 1,802 passed the quality control step. We
imputed genotypes using the 1000 Genomes Project as the reference panel
(Data Supplement).
Statistical Methods
Association Analyses. We evaluated associations of SNPs with risks
of breast and prostate cancer simultaneously using multinomial logistic
regression. The control group in this analysis was defined as the set of
samples without a breast or prostate cancer diagnosis. Breast and prostate
cancer cases were defined on the basis of age at diagnosis, whichever
occurred first. If breast and prostate cancer occurred at the same time,
individuals were treated as patients with breast cancer. Thus, of 1,802
samples, 277 were defined as patients with breast cancer, 212 as patients
with prostate cancer, and 1,313 as controls. Analyses were adjusted for
the first three principal components, age at breast or prostate cancer for
patient-cases and age at interview for controls, and gene (BRCA1 or
BRCA2). A robust variance approach—clustering of family member-
ship—was used to adjust for related individuals. Additional logistic
regression analyses were carried out to assess associations separately with
breast or prostate cancer risk (Data Supplement). We also performed
a set of sensitivity analyses by considering patient cases with both breast
and prostate cancer as a separate group in a multinomial logistic
regression model (Data Supplement). Analysis was performed in R
(version 3.2.3; R Foundation, Vienna, Austria) and STATA software
(version 13.1; STATA, College Station, TX; Computing Resource
Center, Santa Monica, CA).
Polygenic Risk Scores. Assuming a log-additive model for the joint
effects of SNPs, we constructed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) by summing
the number of alleles across SNPs that were weighted by their estimated
per-allele log-odds ratios (ORs) in published studies11,12,22,25-32 (Data
Supplement).
PRSs were standardized to have mean 0 and variance 1 (Data
Supplement). We evaluated associations with quartiles of PRS on the basis
of the PRS distribution in controls. Absolute age-specific cumulative risks
of developing breast or prostate cancer at different percentiles of PRS were
calculated using published methods33 (Data Supplement).
Selection of SNPs Included in PRSs and Weights. Breast Cancer
PRSs. We investigated three main PRSs using SNPs that were known to be
associated with overall risk of breast cancer or risk of estrogen receptor
(ER)–positive or –negative breast cancer from published studies that were
performed in females from the general population. To construct each PRS
and to avoid over-fitting, we used external log-OR estimates—for their
association with risk for overall breast cancer or ER-positive or ER-negative
breast cancer—from the largest association studies of the Breast Cancer
Association Consortium.12,22,28-31,34 No data from the current study were
used to construct any of the PRSs. The three PRSs were defined as follows:
1. The overall PRS includes SNPs that were associated with breast cancer
risk from population-based association studies. This PRS included 88
(77 genotyped, 11 imputed) SNPs.
2. The ER-positive PRS includes SNPs that were associated with ER-
positive breast cancer. This PRS included 87 (76 genotyped, 11
imputed) SNPs. Weights for each SNP were based on published log-
OR estimates for ER-positive breast cancer.
3. The ER-negative PRS includes SNPs associated with ER-negative
disease. This PRS included 53 (47 genotyped, six imputed) SNPs.
Weights for each SNP were based on log-OR estimates for ER-
negative breast cancer.

Polygenic Risk Scores in Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers
 A list of SNPs and weights used in each PRS is shown in the Data
Supplement. To identify the most strongly associated PRS, we have
evaluated the associations of all three PRSs in the set of BRCA1 and BRCA2
samples combined and separately.
We also investigated two PRSs by using SNPs that were associated
with breast cancer risk for female BRCA1/2 mutation carriers (Data
Supplement).
Prostate Cancer PRS. Prostate cancer PRS included variants that
were associated with prostate cancer at genome-wide significant level in
studies of the PRACTICAL consortium.11,14,32,35-38 Log-OR estimates from
published population-based studies were used according to the approach
above.11,32 This PRS included 103 (71 genotyped, 32 imputed) SNPs (Data
Supplement).
RESULTS
We evaluated associations for a total of 9,530,887 SNPs in 1,802
male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, including 277 patients with
breast cancer, 212 patients with prostate cancer, and 1,313
controls. We investigated associations in the combined sample of
BRCA1/2 mutation carriers and separately in BRCA2 mutation
carriers. The number of BRCA1 mutation carriers was too small
to allow for separate analyses. Across the two analyses, no as-
sociations at P , 1028 were identified. A total of 577 SNPs
exhibited associations at P , 1025. GWAS results are reported in
the Data Supplement.
Breast Cancer PRSs
Of 102 SNPs included in the breast cancer PRSs, 68 SNPs
(67%) yielded OR estimates in the same direction as those that
have been previously reported for females in the general pop-
ulation. Eleven SNPs were associated with breast cancer risk at
P , .05 (Data Supplement). After accounting for multiple testing,
there was no evidence of pairwise interactions between any two
variants in the PRSs.
The three main breast cancer PRSs that were constructed on
the basis of associations with female breast cancer risk were
strongly associated with male breast cancer risk for both BRCA1
and BRCA2 mutation carriers (Table 1). The OR estimate for male
breast cancer per standard deviation (SD) increase in overall PRS
was estimated to be 1.36 (95% CI, 1.19 to 1.56; P = 8.6 3 1026) in
combined BRCA1/2 carriers. Associations remained significant
when BRCA1 and BRCA2 carriers were analyzed separately
(BRCA1: OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.07 to 2.07; P = .019; BRCA2: OR,
1.36; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.58; P = 7.2 3 1025). Men in the 3rd and 4th
quartiles were at significantly increased risk of breast cancer
compared with men in the bottom quartile of the PRS (Table 1),
but the numbers of carriers in individual quartiles in the BRCA1
only analyses were too small to draw definitive conclusions.
The magnitude and strength of associations were similar for
the PRS that was constructed on the basis of SNPs associated with
ER-positive breast cancer in females (Table 1). The ER-negative
PRS showed a weaker association with breast cancer risk for male
carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. Results were similar when the
associations were evaluated using logistic regression (Data Sup-
plement) and when considering the patients with both breast and
prostate cancer as a separate group in a multinomial logistic re-
gression model (Data Supplement).
Prostate Cancer PRS
Of 103 SNPs that were included in the prostate cancer PRS, 74
SNPs (71%) had estimated ORs in the same direction as those
previously reported in population-based studies. Eight SNPs were
associated at P , .05 (Data Supplement).
There was a highly significant association between the prostate
cancer PRS and prostate cancer risk for male carriers of BRCA1/2
mutations (OR for prostate cancer per SD increase, 1.56; 95% CI,
1.35 to 1.81; P = 3.2 3 1029; Table 2). Associations remained
significant when analyses were performed separately for carriers of
BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (BRCA1: OR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.30 to
2.29; P = 1.8 3 1024; BRCA2: OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.26 to 1.77;
P = 4.9 3 1026). There was an increasing risk of prostate cancer
with increasing PRS quartiles. When compared with the 1st
quartile, OR for prostate cancer for men in the 2nd quartile was
1.82 (95% CI, 1.07 to 3.08; P = .026), for men in the 3rd quartile,
2.23 (95% CI, 1.32 to 3.76; P = .003), and for men in the 4th
quartile, 3.36 (95% CI, 2.05 to 5.52; P = 1.7 3 1026).
We observed significant associations between prostate cancer
PRS with both low (, 7) and high ($ 7) Gleason score prostate
cancers (Table 2). There was no evidence of interaction between
age at diagnosis and/or observation and any breast or prostate
cancer PRSs (Data Supplement).
Discriminatory Ability
The overall breast cancer and ER-positive PRSs had an area
under the curve (AUC) of 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55 to 0.63). ER-negative
PRS had the lowest AUC at 0.55 (95% CI, 0.51 to 0.59). The AUC
for prostate cancer PRS was estimated to be 0.62 (95% CI, 0.58 to
0.66).
Predicted Risks of Male Breast and Prostate Cancer by
PRS Percentile
We used the estimated OR for the breast cancer overall PRS
and the prostate cancer PRS from the combined analysis of
BRCA1/2 samples to calculate male breast and prostate cancer risks
at the 5th, 10th, 50th, 90th, and 95th percentiles of PRS distri-
butions (Figs 1, 2, and 3 and Data Supplement). There were large
differences in absolute risks between percentile groups. For BRCA2
carriers, the risk of breast cancer by age 80 years is 5% for men at
the 5th percentile of the PRS and 14% for men at the 95th per-
centile; the risk of prostate cancer by age 80 years is 19% for men at
the 5th percentile of the PRS and 61% for men at the 95th per-
centile. For carriers of BRCA1 mutations, men at the 5th percentile
of the prostate cancer PRS have a 7% risk of developing prostate
cancer by age 80, and men at the 95th percentile of the PRS
distribution have a prostate cancer risk of 26%.
DISCUSSION
We performed the first GWAS, to our knowledge, in male carriers
of BRCA1/2 mutations to identify common variants that modify
the risks of breast and prostate cancer in these men. Although we
analyzed the largest series of male mutation carriers available, this
study is underpowered to detect associations with individual low-
risk SNPs.

Lecarpentier et al
 We have demonstrated that the combined effects of known
breast cancer susceptibility SNPs modify breast cancer risk for male
mutation carriers and, separately, that the combined effects of
known prostate cancer susceptibility SNPs modify prostate cancer
risk for male mutation carriers.
PRSs that were constructed with SNPs for female breast cancer
and prostate cancer in the general population are highly predictive
of risk in male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations. These results
provide the first direct evidence of overlap in the genetic sus-
ceptibility to female breast and prostate cancers in the general
population as well as the modification of risks of male breast and
prostate cancer in men with BRCA1/2 mutations.
We estimated an OR for breast cancer of 1.36 per SD increase in
the overall breast cancer PRS. No study in the general population has
assessed this exact PRS yet, but Mavaddat et al15 estimated an OR for
female breast cancer of 1.55 for a PRS based on a subset of SNPs in
females. Although the present estimate in males is not significantly
different from that observed in females, it is somewhat lower. A
lower OR may be a result of certain breast cancer SNPs that were
included in the PRS that are not associated with male breast cancer
risk, or individual SNPs may have smaller ORs for male breast cancer
than female breast cancer. Alternatively, the estimate of Mavaddat
et al15 may be susceptible to some level of winner’s curse bias.
The prostate cancer PRS was associated with prostate cancer
risk in male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, with an OR of 1.56 per
SD increase in PRS. A previous study on prostate cancer PRS in the
general population estimated an OR of 1.74.14
Overall, our results indicate that population-based breast and
prostate cancer PRSs are predictive of cancer risk for male
mutation carriers, which suggests a general model of susceptibility
under which BRCA1/2 mutations and other common cancer
susceptibility variants interact multiplicatively on the risk of de-
veloping breast and prostate cancers.
To calculate PRSs we have used SNPs and corresponding log-
OR estimates from external, population-based studies; therefore,
the present analysis represents an independent validation of those
externally derived PRSs and indicates that they are independently
predictive of cancer risks for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations.
Although the present analysis was based on a case-control study
design, information on SNPs is not subject to the usual biases that
are associated with retrospective studies (eg, recall biases);
therefore, the reported associations between the PRSs investigated
and cancer risks are unlikely to be influenced by the study design.
The ER-positive PRS had a stronger association with male
breast cancer in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers than did the
ER-negative PRS, which was in line with the observation that the
majority of male patients with breast cancer among BRCA1/2
mutation carriers are ER positive.23
We observed large differences in absolute risk between men in
the bottom and the top of the PRS distribution. In particular, prostate
cancer risk by age 80 years for male carriers of BRCA1 mutations
ranges from 7% for those at the bottom 5% of the risk distribution to
26% for those at the top 5% of the PRS distribution. By age 80 years,
male carriers of BRCA2 mutations are predicted to have a risk of
prostate cancer that ranges from 19% for those at the bottom 5% of
the risk distribution to 61% for those at the top 5% of the distri-
bution, and a breast cancer risk that ranges from 5% to 14%.
In these calculations, we assumed conservative average
prostate cancer risks for both BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations;
however, higher estimates for the effect of BRCA1/2 mutations
have been reported in the literature.4,9 Prospective studies of male
mutation carriers will be useful for assessing the calibration of
absolute cancer risks by PRS percentiles; however, such studies are
not currently available with sufficiently large numbers of incident
male breast and prostate cancer cases.
Although there are no established screening or intervention
strategies for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations, few clinical
management recommendations include education, clinical breast
examination, and prostate cancer screening.39 The present findings
may inform the development of clinical recommendations on the
basis of polygenic risk stratification of male mutation carriers to
personalize management recommendations. For example, the current

Polygenic Risk Scores in Male BRCA1 and BRCA2 Mutation Carriers
 United Kingdom NICE guidelines recommend enhanced surveillance
for women with a lifetime risk greater than 17% of developing breast
cancer, regardless of their BRCA1/2 status.40 Similar approaches may
be developed for male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations for whom
management would differ on the basis of their individual lifetime risk.
For example, on the basis of the prostate cancer PRS, 43% of menwith
BRCA1 mutations are predicted to have a prostate cancer risk of
greater than 17% and may benefit from enhanced screening, whereas
those at lower risk may opt for more limited surveillance.
Our data provide a strong impetus for new prospective screening
studies in high-risk cohorts, such as the IMPACT trial,41 to include
genetic risk assessment by PRSs in study protocols to assess the impact
of cancer risk stratification in male mutation carriers. Recently, it has
been suggested that polygenic risk-stratified screening can reduce
overdiagnosis in the general population.42-44 Similar arguments may
apply to male mutation carriers in whom polygenic risk prediction
may further improve the effectiveness of screening.
A potential limitation of the current study is that family
history information was not readily available for mutation carriers;
therefore it was not possible to assess how the prostate and breast
cancer risks in male carriers that are associated with PRSs vary by
family history. Although this would not invalidate the association
results, considering the effect of family history will be important in
the context of genetic counseling.
Men with BRCA1/2 mutations represent a small but unique
patient group in terms of clinical management. Our results suggest
that risk profiling on the basis of PRSs may identify male carriers of
BRCA1/2 mutations at both sufficiently reduced or increased risk of
breast or prostate cancer, with implications for their clinical man-
agement. To facilitate this, it will be important to incorporate such
PRSs into breast or prostate cancer risk prediction algorithms.45
As an accurate risk assessment is the basis of cancer prevention
and screening strategies, the PRSs presented here may be used to
provide male carriers of BRCA1/2 mutations and their physicians
with more detailed information on their breast and prostate cancer
risks to aid prevention and screening decisions.
