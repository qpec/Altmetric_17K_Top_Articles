ABSTRACT Recent research indicates that youth with autism spectrum disor-
der (ASD) show increases in prosocial behaviors in the presence of animals, yet
few studies have examined the effects of incorporating animals into treatments.
The current study evaluated the effectiveness of an animal-
assisted social skills
training group for youth with ASD.
 It was hypothesized that incorporating dogs
into social skills training (SST) would produce a greater effect on improving so-
cial skills, theory of mind, and feelings of inclusion than would be obtained from
SST without an animal present.
 We compared social skills groups with therapy
dogs to traditional social skills groups without an animal present.
 Students with
ASD attending school at a therapeutic treatment facility (n = 31;
 ages 8–14)
were assigned to either experimental or control groups, which were both
 
provided with 12 weeks of weekly treatment.
 Following participation in SST, par-
ticipants in the groups with dogs were rated as significantly less symptomatic
than participants in the traditional social skills group on the Social Responsive-
ness Scale (SRS-2), a teacher-rated measure of autism-related symptoms.
Based on self-
report ratings using the Children’
s Depression Inventory (CDI-
2),
participants in the groups with dogs experienced significantly greater reductions
in symptoms measured by the Interpersonal Problems and Functional Prob-
lems subscales, and not on the other subscales of the CDI-2.
 Both groups
showed improvement in theory of mind and decreased feelings of isolation and
overall depressive symptoms;
 however, the effect of group on change over time
was not significant.
 On the Social Language Development Test (SLDT), no sig-
nificant differences were observed.
 The current findings indicate animal-
assisted
social skills training may be more beneficial for improving social skills and
 
reducing related affective symptoms than traditional training models.

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) present with per-
sistent social communication deficits across multiple settings
(5th ed.
;
 DSM–5;
 American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2013).

 Delays in social communication skills influence the development of social relationships with
peers and adults, and contribute to limited and less reciprocal friendships in comparison with
typically developing peers (Chamberlain, Kasari, & Rotheram-Fuller, 2007).
 In addition to hav-
ing an impact on social functioning, social communication deficits have been associated with
increased feelings of isolation and internalizing problems in children with ASD, including symp-
toms of depression and anxiety (Krasny, Williams, Provencal, & Ozonoff, 2003;
 Russell &
Sofronoff, 2005).
 A growing body of research suggests that children with ASD show improved
social functioning during interactions with animals (Nimer & Lundahl, 2007).
 While in the pres-
ence of an animal, children with ASD have been found to approach and interact with others
significantly more frequently than without an animal present (Prothmann, Ettrich, & Prothmann,
2009).
 Working with animals may also help children understand their own and others’
 mental
states (Melson, 2001), a skill that is characteristically underdeveloped in children with ASD.
Given preliminary evidence that animal interactions promote various social skills, there is a
need to investigate whether animal interactions can be used to improve the effectiveness of
social skills training programs.
 
Social Communication in Individuals with ASD
The DSM-
5 describes the core features of ASD as persistent deficits in social communication and
the presence of restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities (APA, 2013).
Symptoms may include difficulty initiating or sustaining social interactions, atypical eye contact,
limited use of gestures, and difficulty maintaining relationships.
 Symptom severity and presenta-
tion can range greatly between individuals, with language ability, IQ, age, and exposure to
 
interventions all thought to contribute to the manifestation of the disorder (Mayes & Calhoun,
2011;
 Volden, Coolican, Garon, White, & Bryson, 2009).
 High-
functioning individuals with ASD
may possess age-expected cognitive skills and the ability to speak in complete sentences
(Joseph, Tager-
Flusberg, & Lord, 2002), yet exhibit impairments in the ability to accurately read
facial expressions, interpret social cues, and perceive the thoughts and feelings of others (Adams,
Green, Gilchrest, & Cox, 2002;
 Church, Alisanski, & Amanullah, 2000;
 Downs & Smith, 2004).
Many individuals with ASD also show reduced interest in social interactions or may attempt to
initiate friendships in a manner that is perceived as odd (Geschwind & Levitt, 2007).
 
Deficits in social communication have been associated with a range of outcomes for youth
with ASD, including social isolation, difficulty forming relationships, low self-
esteem,  
depression,
and anxiety disorders (Krasny et al.
, 2003;
 Russell, & Sofronoff, 2005).
 Children with high-
functioning ASD have been found to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety at a
greater rate than the general population and they are at greater risk for developing mood and
anxiety problems than typically functioning children (Kim, Szatmari, Bryson, Streiner, &  
Wilson,
2000).
 Not surprisingly, social communication delays have also been associated with increased
peer conflicts, reduced number of friendships, and school absences (Lee, Harrington, Louie,
& Newschaffer, 2008;
 Orsmond, Krauss, & Seltzer, 2004).
 
Treatment for Social Communication Deficits ASD
Given the impact of social impairments on the functioning of individuals with ASD, it is
 
suggested that all children with ASD may benefit from social skills training (SST) programs
(Bellini & Peters, 2008).
 Group-based SST programs are a logical intervention format because
they promote interaction with other children and provide opportunities to use newly learned
skills in a relatively realistic setting (Barry et al.
, 2003;
 White, Keonig, & Scahill, 2007).
 While
overall SST treatment goals vary (Rao, Beidel, & Murray, 2008), most relate to multiple aspects

AZ 30(2)_Layout 1  4/30/17  10:06 PM  Page 308
 of social development.
 Common treatment goals include increasing social motivation, play
skills, conflict management strategies, social cognition (e.
g.
, theory of mind, problem solving,
and emotion regulation), and the understanding of emotions in one’
s self and others (Baker,
2003;
 Bareket, 2006;
 Weitlauf et al.
, 2014).
 Skills are typically taught with the use of behav-
ioral and social learning techniques (Cooper, Griffith, & Filer, 1999;
 McConnell, 2002), and
scheduled practice opportunities (Cappadocia & Weiss, 2011).
 Research has shown that
 
following participation in SST groups, children with ASD perform better on theory of mind tasks
(Bauminger, 2007);
 earn significantly higher scores on facial recognition tasks (Solomon,
Goodlin-Jones, & Anders, 2004);
 and are rated as significantly higher functioning on stan-
dardized social skills scales by parents and teachers (Lopata, Thomeer, Volker, Nida, & Lee,
2008;
 Tse, Strulovitch, Tagalakis, Meng, & Fombonne, 2007).
 Social skills training models vary
and may be implemented individually, in groups, and with or without parent training (Weitlauf
et al.
, 2014).
 With regard to the length, frequency, and duration of SST programs, a review by
Cappadocia and Weiss (2011) found that SST programs tend to range in duration from 8 to
13 sessions provided across 6.
5 to 12 weeks, with the total number of intervention hours
ranging from 8–18 hours.
 The results of previous studies on the effectiveness of social skills
training provide preliminary evidence that children with autism can acquire specific social skills
with direct training.
 However, since social and communication deficits are a source of functional
impairment for children with autism, there is a need for research and development in order to
improve upon existing programs.
 
Animal-assisted Interventions
Animals have been described as social catalysts, whose presence positively influences inter-
actions between people (McNicholas & Collis, 2006).
 Of note is research showing that children
with ASD engage in more frequent and longer social interactions while in the presence of an
animal compared with people or toys (Prothmann, Ettrich, & Prothmann, 2009).
 The ability of
animals to act as social catalysts is supported in a recent study comparing small-group inter-
actions between school-age children while in the presence of a guinea pigs versus toys
(O’
Haire, McKenzie, Beck, & Slaughter, 2013).
 In the guinea pig condition, children with ASD
showed significantly more social approach behaviors toward typically developing peers.
 
Typically developing peers also showed significantly more social approach behaviors directed
toward students with ASD.
 In the same study, children with ASD exhibited significantly
 
increased eye-contact and positive affect (e.
g.
, smiling, laughing);
 and significantly decreased
negative affect in the guinea pig condition.
 
The finding of an increase in positive social behaviors is consistent with other evidence
that the presence of an animal seems to influence the quality of social behaviors in children with
ASD.
 Children with ASD have been found to use significantly more language in occupational
therapy sessions that incorporate animals versus sessions without animals (Sams, Fortney, &
Willenbring, 2006), and show more smiling and social engagement in therapy sessions that
 
include a dog versus a stuffed dog or toy (Martin & Farnum, 2002;
 Silva, Correia, Lima,
 
Magalhaes, & de Sousa, 2011).
 In order to increase measurement accuracy, Funahashi,
 
Gruebler, Aoki, Kadone, and Suzuki (2014) assessed smiling and social behaviors in a child
with ASD using an electromyography device and video recording during sessions with a dog,
therapist, and parent.
 When comparing the first session to the fourth session, the authors
found a 3-fold increase in positive social behaviors (e.
g.
, smiling, watching the dog, verbal
communication with the dog/
others) and notable decreases in negative behaviors (e.
g.
, anger,
Becker et al.

anxiety, escaping).
 These studies indicate that animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) may be
helpful for promoting initiation of social interactions and maintenance of interactions using both
verbal and nonverbal communication, which are two key deficits associated with ASD.
 
The stress-reducing effects of AAIs also contribute to their appeal for youth with ASD,
who often exhibit social anxiety and avoid social situations (Kuusiko et al.
, 2008).
 The non-
judgmental social support offered by animals is frequently highlighted as a unique benefit of
AAIs (Friesen, 2009).
 In the capacity of offering social support and stress reduction, therapy
animals have been included in reading remediation programs (Briggs Newlin, 2003), court
 
proceedings (Ng, 2011), and interventions for emotionally dysregulated children with
 
developmental disabilities (Greene, 2012).
 
It is possible that increases in prosocial behaviors during human–animal interactions are due
to favorable physiological changes that occur in the participants.
 Studies show that interac-
tions with animals can affect a variety of physiological processes related to stress reduction,
including decreased heart rate (Polheber & Matchock, 2014) and cortisol levels (Beetz et al.
,
2011).
 Research on physiological changes in children with ASD is scarce, however Viau et al.
(2011) showed that children with ASD show significantly reduced waking cortisol levels
 
following the introduction of a service dog into the home, and subsequent increases in  
cortisol
levels after removal of the dog.
 
With regard to non-ASD populations, Beetz and colleagues (2012) proposed that some of
the beneficial effects of human–animal interactions, such as enhanced empathy and social
attention, might be attributable to the release of oxytocin, a hormone associated with social
bonding.
 They suggested that biological processes involved in social bonding between
 
humans are similar to those that occur between humans and dogs.
 Preliminary data support
the role of oxytocin in observed effects of animal interactions.
 Odendaal (2000) found signifi-
cant increases in oxytocin in adults who interacted with a dog versus adults who read quietly.
Similarly, significant increases in oxytocin were found in a group of women interacting with
their own dogs compared with a control group (Handlin et al.
, 2011).
 
In our study, we implemented and evaluated an animal-assisted social skills intervention
with dogs for children with high functioning ASD.
 We hypothesized that participants would
improve their ability to connect and interact with others through work with animals in a
 
structured therapeutic format.
 We expected that incorporating dogs into the intervention
would produce a greater effect on social skills, perspective taking, theory of mind, and feel-
ings of isolation than can be obtained from conventional social skills training, after the  
program
is completed.
Our study tested the following three hypotheses:
 1) Participants in the animal-assisted
 
social skills groups would show improvements in social skills, as measured by significant
 
differences in scores on the Social Language Development Test, (subtests A and D) and the
Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition (SRS-2).
 Further, the change in SRS-2 and
SLDT subtest scores in the animal-assisted therapy group would be significantly greater
than the change in scores in the traditional social skills group;
 2) Participants in the animal-
 
assisted social skills groups would show improvements in theory of mind, or the ability to
infer the mental state of others, as measured by significant change in scores on the Read-
ing the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET).
 Further, changes in RMET scores would be signifi-
cantly greater in the animal-assisted therapy group compared with the traditional social
skills group;
 and 3) Participants in the animal-assisted social skills groups would show a
 
decrease in maladaptive i 
nternalizing and externalizing behaviors, including feelings of

isolation and depressive symptoms, as measured by negative change scores on the Chil-
dren’
s Depression Inventory 2nd Edition (CDI-2).
 Further, changes in CDI-2 scores would
be significantly greater in the  
animal-assisted therapy group compared with the standard
social skills group.
Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from a special education Therapeutic Day Program (TDP) and
 
Residential Treatment Center (RTC).
 All students with a parent-
reported history of ASD,  
Autistic
Disorder, Asperger’
s Disorder, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified
(PDD-NOS) were invited to participate.
 Inclusion criteria for participants included a previous
 
diagnosis and adequate language skills for participation in activities, specifically fluent verbal
skills.
 An allergy to dogs, intellectual disability (IQ below 70), and severe language disorder
were exclusionary criteria for the study.
 Thirty-two students were recruited and met inclusion
criteria.
 One student moved during the study and was removed.
 The majority of the participants
were boys (28 boys and 3 girls), which reflected the school’
s demographics.
 They ranged in
age from 8–14 years old (M = 10.
97;
 SD = 1.
84).
 Parental consent and participant assent
were obtained prior to data collection.
Procedure
Participants were assigned to either the experimental or control conditions based on sched-
uling availability.
 Each condition had one group of children ages 8–10 and one group ages
11–14.
 There were 7–8 children in each group.
 All groups met for one hour each week over
12 weeks.
The study utilized a between-within repeated measures design.
 Within two weeks  
before
and after the 12-week trial, participants were individually administered assessments of
 
depressive symptoms, theory of mind ability, and social skills.
 All assessments measured at
pre-test were administered by graduate students in psychology who were blind to partici-
pants’
 assigned conditions.
 All assessment questions were read to each child in order to
 
minimize the influence of any reading difficulties.
 After the final group, participants’
 classroom
teachers completed a rating scale of social behaviors associated with ASD symptoms
 
designed as a teacher rating scale (SRS-2).
 Due to scheduling and other logistical reasons,
it was necessary to begin the study at the end of the school year.
 One challenge associated
with the timing of the start date was that teachers were occupied with end-of-year events
and the high volume of documentation that is required for assessing and grading students
with special needs.
 Although it would have been ideal to collect teacher reports prior to the
interventions, it was not possible to do so given that teachers experienced time constraints
 
related to end-of-year demands.
  
Despite having made several follow up attempts in person,
by email, and by phone, the investigators were unable to collect adequate pretest data for
the teacher-rated SRS-2.
 Teachers were not informed of group assignments;
 however, the
researchers could not control for  
participant disclosure to teachers on a daily basis.
 All other
post-test assessments were  
completed by the same psychology graduate students as
 
during the pre-test.
The SST groups were co-facilitated by two professional therapists, with graduate degrees
in psychology or social work.
 All therapists were experienced in working with children with
ASD.
 The study therapists were trained by the PI and co-investigators and worked in pairs to

 run one experimental group and one control group.
 In the experimental condition, two
 
handler/
therapeutic dog teams were integrated into each group.
The curriculum’
s format and content were modeled after published social skills curricula for
children with ASD, and included sessions about getting acquainted, making friends and con-
versation, play skills, empathy, self-
regulation, and conflict management (Baker, 2003;
 Bareket,
2006).
 All groups had the same target skill each week and followed the same schedule, i 
nclud-
ing:
 a) review of previous skills, b) an introduction to the session goal and activity, 
c) modeling and practice, and d) a review of the target skill.
 Consistent with reviews of  
previous
SST groups, a host of teaching techniques were used, including direct instruction, modeling,
role-playing, shaping, feedback, and reinforcement of positive interactions (Cappadocia &
Weiss, 2011).
 See Table 1 for an overview of the curriculum by session.
In the experimental condition, participants’
 interactions with the dogs varied based on
the stage of the session and the session’
s target skill.
 During the greeting and “good bye”
stages, each child had the chance to pet the dog individually.
 After the participants greeted
the dogs, they observed one of the study therapists and dog/
handler teams demonstrated
the activity.
 For the activity, the children were split into small work groups comprised of one
therapist, four children, and one dog/
handler team.
 Activities included having the children
co-lead a dog with the handler (i.
e.
, using two leashes so both handler and child held leash),
practice asking dogs to perform basic commands, practice grooming, and practice appro-
priate ways to approach and engage dogs.
 In the final review stage, the AAI group met as 
a whole and the session goals were reviewed by asking children to either verbalize or
 
demonstrate the skill to the group.
Both groups used activities adapted from manual-based social skills training curriculums
for youth with ASD (Coucouvanis, 2005;
 Gutstein & Sheely, 2002).
 The traditional session
goals aligned exactly with animal sessions, and whenever possible, the session content
 
mirrored the animal sessions.
 For example, both groups did an activity with Lego® to work on
shifting between social roles of leader and follower.
 An effort was made to incorporate a sim-
ilar level of movement and hands-on activity in the traditional groups as was included in the
groups with dogs.
 
Attempts were made to control the confounding variables of therapist, handler/
dog team,
session content, and setting.
 Each pair of therapists ran one experimental group and one con-
trol group to minimize the influence of therapist skill or style on the intervention.
 The locations
of the groups were the same across groups to remove the influence of the setting.
 The
 
inclusion of multiple handler/
dog teams reduced the influence of a particular dog, which is
 
important for eliminating the possibility that significant results could be attributed to the  
appeal
of an individual dog (Kazdin, 2011).
 The session content was also manualized and largely
scripted, in order to achieve consistency across groups.
 Therapists met with investigators
ahead of time in order to reinforce adherence to manual.
Multiple measures were taken to ensure that the children and dogs interacted safely.
The sessions were modeled after the EAGALA model of equine-assisted therapy, in which
one individual is primarily responsible for handling the animal’
s needs and another individual
is primarily responsible for providing the therapeutic intervention (Equine Assisted Growth
and Learning Association, Inc.
, 2006).
 The structure of including a clinician and an addi-
tional individual responsible for monitoring the well-being of the animal has also been  
referred
to as the diamond model (Brooks, 2006).
 As part of the model, the clinicians were actively
engaged in ongoing communication with both the handlers and children to ensure that all

 participants felt comfortable engaging in the activities.
 The handler–dog teams were previ-
ously certified through Pet Partners, The Good Dog Foundation, or Therapy Dogs
 
International.
 Therapy dog certifications from each of the aforementioned organizations
 
require that handler–dog teams pass a series of tests designed to assess the handler’
s lead-
ership of the team and ability to monitor the dog’
s needs, as well as the dog’
s temperament
and suitability for therapy work.
 They also require that dogs have health and fitness docu-
mentation from veterinarians.
 Children were provided with explicit guidelines for appropriate
interactions with the dogs (i.
e.
, use gentle hands, use indoor voices), which were reviewed
at the start of each session.
 The handlers monitored the dogs closely for signs of distress
and a safety procedure was created to be used in the event that children exhibited overly
loud or unpredictable behaviors.
 
This study was reviewed and approved by the Green Chimneys Institutional Review Board
(IRB).
 The IRB is made up of experts in both the ethical treatment of animals as well as the
 
ethical treatment of humans;
 thus, it also served as an equivalent to an Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) review.
 
Instruments
Childhood Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (CARS-2): In order to assess ASD symptom
severity in participants, mental health clinicians treating each child with individual therapy were
asked to complete the Childhood Autism Rating Scale, Second Edition (CARS-2).
 The CARS-
2 is a brief rating scale that is widely used in the identification of ASD symptoms.
 Based on
the behavior ratings of trained observers, it offers symptom ratings on 15 dimensions or symp-
toms of autism;
 an internal reliability coefficient of 0.
93 has been reported for this measure
(Schopler, Van Bourgondien, Wellman, & Love, 2010).
 
Children’s Depression Inventory-Second Edition (CDI-2): The Children’
s Depression Inventory–
Second Edition (CDI-2) is a 28-item, self-report questionnaire used to assess cognitive, affec-
tive, and behavioral symptoms of depression.
 On each item, children are asked to choose
from one of three statements that best describe their feelings over the previous two weeks.
 The
CDI-2 assesses emotional and functional problems associated with depression.
 It provides an
overall score as well as individual subscale scores in the areas of negative mood/
physical
problems, negative self-esteem, ineffectiveness, and interpersonal problems (Kovacs & MHS
Staff, 2011).
 This test is suitable for children ages 6–17.
 Test-
retest reliability showed short-
term
stability with nearly no change during a time period of 2–4 week intervals, and CDI-2 forms
showed acceptable levels of internal consistency, with Cronbach’
s alpha values from 0.
67 to
0.
91 for total and subscales for all age and sex groups (Bae, 2012).
 The CDI-2 has been used
to assess symptoms of depression in children and adolescents with ASD (Wijnhoven,
Creemers, Engels, & Granic, 2015).
 
Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET): The Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET)
 
evaluates one’
s ability to infer another person’
s mental state from a photograph of only their
eye region (Baron-Cohen, Wheelwright, Hill, Raste, & Plum, 2001;
 Vrouva, Target, & Ensink,
2012).
 It is used to assess children’
s implicit nonlinguistic theory of mind.
 The RMET consists
of a series of 28 images of eyes depicting emotion states, with a forced choice between four
mental-state terms for each.
 Baron-Cohen and colleagues found that adults with Asperger’
s
syndrome or high-functioning autism showed significant impairment on the RMET as
 
compared with a typical sample group;
 whereas they found no group differences on gender

 recognition control tests.
 Hallerbäck and colleagues (2009) examined the test-retest reliability
of the RMET and found mean differences for all subjects of 0.
33, with standard deviation 2.
16.
There was also no indication of learning effects when the test was repeated.
 
Social Language Development Test (SLDT), Making Inferences and Supporting Peers
 
Subtests: The Social Language Development Test (SLDT) is a standardized measure of ver-
bal and nonverbal social language skills.
 Results of normative analyses conducted on the
SLDT indicate that it significantly discriminates between children with ASD and children with
typically developing language abilities (Bowers, Huisingh, & LoGiudize, 2008).
 Subtest A,
 
“Making Inferences,” assesses a student’
s ability to accurately make inferences about  
another
person’
s thoughts and feeling state using cues, such as facial expression.
 Subtest D,
 
“Supporting Peers,” measures the ability to identify and take the perspective of a friend or
 
individual based on scenarios presented in narrative form.
 According to Bowers, Huisingh,
and LoGuidize (2008), the test-retest coefficient is 0.
79 for the total test, the SEM is 11.
26
for the total test, and the KR20 coefficient is 0.
93.
 The mean test-retest reliability coefficients
were reported as r = 0.
63 for “Making Inferences,” and r = 0.
75 for “Supporting Peers”
 
(Bowers, Huisingh, & LoGiudize, 2008).
 
Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (SRS-2): Classroom teachers completed the
SRS-2 “Teacher Report” following the 12 sessions, to measure differences in social compe-
tence.
 The SRS-2 is a 65-item, standardized measure of children’
s social competence, where
social deficits are rated on a 4-point Likert scale.
 The SRS-2 “Teacher Report” measures the
severity of the social impairments related to ASD as observed by the child’
s teacher.
 Social
 
impairments assessed include social awareness, social information processing, the capacity
for reciprocal social communication, social anxiety/
avoidance, and autistic preoccupations
and traits.
 The SRS-2 manual reports internal consistency (Cronbach’
s alpha) for the total
score for boys as 0.
93, and test–retest reliability as 0.
85, with a 17-month period between
 
testing (Constantino & Gruber, 2005).
Data Analysis
Data were entered into Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) for analysis.
 An
 
independent-samples t-test was used to determine if there were differences between the
 
experimental group and the control group in teacher reported SRS-2 scores at the conclusion
of the study.
 Repeated-measures mixed ANOVAs were used to examine change over time as
a function of treatment condition on the SLDT, CDI-
2, and RMET.
 Assumptions testing was car-
ried out for each analysis and boxplots were used to asses for outliers in the data.
 Cohen’
s d
values were used as measures of effect size.
Results
Sample Characteristics
A total of 31 youth with a previous diagnosis of ASD or related spectrum disorder participated
in the study.
 Participants ranged in age from 8–14 years.
 One student was not available at the
time of pre-testing and was therefore not included in the self-report data.
 Demographic infor-
mation regarding sex, age, IQ, and diagnosis of each participant was collected through review
of records.
 The mean IQ for the sample was in the average range.
 There was a response rate
of 80% for the Childhood Autism Rating Scale-Second Edition (CARS-2) surveys, and all par-
ticipants met criteria for at least mild to moderate symptoms of autism spectrum disorder.

Teacher-Reported Social Skills Ratings
An independent-samples t-test was used to determine if there were differences between the
experimental group and the control group in teacher reported SRS-2 scores at the conclusion
of the study.
 Inspection of boxplots revealed one outlier in the Restricted Interests and Repet-
itive Behaviors (RRB) data.
 Scores for each level of condition were normally distributed and
there was homogeneity of variances.
 The outlier did not impact homogeneity of variance and
thus it was included in the analysis.
 Symptom severity was significantly higher in the control
group than in the experimental group, as measured by total SRS-2 scores (t(26) = 3.
98, 
p < 0.
001), and on composite scales measuring overall social interactions, as well as restricted
behaviors (see Table 3).

Interpersonal Problems subscales, one outlier falling over two standard deviations above
the mean was identified from each subscale and removed from the analyses.
 All three out-
liers were self-rating scores belonging to one student.
 A review of the examiner’
s notes
 
indicated that the student was described as unusually agitated and upset over a family
issue during testing.
 Given these observations, the student’
s ratings were not considered
a valid estimate of his symptom level at the time of assessment.
 Following removal of
 
outliers, the CDI-2 Total and all subscale scores were normally distributed and there was
homogeneity of variances.
There was a significant time-by-group interaction on the Interpersonal Problems sub-
scale (F(1, 27) = 8.

Discussion
The purpose of our study was to examine the effectiveness of an animal-assisted social skills
intervention for children with high functioning autism spectrum disorder.
 We compared the
 
effectiveness of an animal-assisted social skills training program with dogs with a traditional
 
social skills training program without the inclusion of dogs.
 We hypothesized that social skills
training would have a significant effect on participants’
 social communication skills, ability to
understand another’
s thoughts and feelings, sense of isolation, and depressive symptoms.
We further predicted that these changes would be significantly greater in the animal-assisted
training group than in the control group.
 We found significant group differences in both teacher
ratings of social behavior and self-report ratings of interpersonal problems, which support the
hypothesis that the inclusion of dogs in social skills training is more effective than traditional
 
programs.
 Since the experimental group and the control group were found to be similar on fac-
tors related to severity of ASD, including age, IQ, and ASD symptom ratings on the CARS-2,
it is likely that group differences are attributable to the effects of the intervention.
 
Teachers were asked to rate the participants’
 severity of social skills deficits based on char-
acteristic symptoms of ASD using the SRS-
2.
 Teacher ratings showed that compared with the
control group, participants who received the animal-
assisted social skills intervention exhibited
fewer social skills deficits overall, fewer restricted and repetitive behaviors, and more typical  
social
communication following the intervention.
 Differences in SRS-
2 ratings are notable  
because they
reflect differences in behaviors that were explicitly targeted in the interventions, such as playing
appropriately with other children, making eye contact, and initiating  
interactions with peers.
In light of research showing high levels of comorbid depression and social isolation in youth
with ASD, we asked participants to rate their symptoms of depression using the CDI-
2 before
and after the intervention.
 After the intervention, both groups reported significant decreases in
 
depressive symptoms on all of the CDI-
2 scales, except Negative Mood/
Physical Symptoms.
 The
improvements measured on the CDI-2 support previous research showing that children’
s
 
depressive symptoms tend to decrease as their social skills increase (Kim et al.
, 2000;
 Krasny
et al.
, 2003).
 Further analyses showed a significant interaction between condition and time on
the Functional Problems composite scale and the Interpersonal Problems subscale, such that
participants in the animal-
assisted social skills training rated themselves as having significantly
fewer symptoms than those in the control group.
 Items on these scales assess problems with
peers, feelings of ineffectiveness, social isolation, and feelings of worth within the family structure.

 To date, few studies have examined the effect of social skills training on affective symptoms,
such as depression.
 One such study found that youth with ASD showed a significant reduction
in symptoms of loneliness following a parent-
assisted social skills intervention (Frankel et al.
, 2010).
Our results suggest that youth with ASD are likely to show reductions in depression following
 
explicit instruction in social behaviors and opportunities for practice.
 Further, incorporating dogs
into social skills training programs appears to significantly reduce specific symptoms of  
depression,
including feelings of isolation and ineffectiveness in social interactions.
 
It is likely that the observed positive effects of including dogs in social skills training are at
least in part attributable to the influence of dogs on participants’
 affective or emotional states.
We suggest that participants were more engaged in learning and practicing social skills in the
experimental group because the dogs helped to make social interactions more enjoyable and
pleasant, thus reinforcing social engagement.
 Traditionally, interventions for ASD have been
largely behavioral and have not focused on children’
s motivation, interests, or emotional states
(Weitlauf et al.
, 2014).
 However, there is growing evidence that interventions for youth with
ASD are more effective when they incorporate activities that motivate and meet the emotional
needs of the participants (Dunst, Trivette, & Hamby, 2012;
 Rogers & Dawson, 2010).
 Previous
researchers have noted that human–animal interactions seem to motivate youth with ASD to
engage in social behaviors (Martin & Farnum, 2002;
 Sams, Fortney, & Willenbring, 2006).
 In
our study, therapists provided anecdotal observations of increased motivation seen in par-
ticipants in the experimental group.
 Youth in the experimental group tended to initiate
 
conversations about the groups with study therapists in between sessions and after the
study had concluded, while those in the traditional groups did not.
 The participants asked
questions like, “When do we have dog group again?” and “Is (therapy dog) coming back?”
Although such inquiries were unexpected and not measured empirically, they suggest that
youth in the experimental group experienced more interest and motivation to be involved in
social skills training with dogs than their peers in the traditional groups.
Regardless of condition, participants in both groups showed improvement in their ability
to understand what another person may be thinking or feeling, as measured by the RMET.
 The
increase in RMET scores shows that children with ASD benefited similarly from theory of mind
training with dogs as with people.
 In other words, children with ASD improved their ability to
conceptualize the thoughts and feelings of others to a similar degree whether they practiced
taking the perspective of a human or of a dog and human in social skills training.
 
Results of the SLDT did not show any significant improvements in performance over time
or between groups.
 The two SLDT subtests included in the study assessed participants’
 abil-
ity to make inferences about a person’
s thoughts and intentions based on a picture, and to
provide examples of social support in response to fictional scenarios.
 The average posttest
scores earned by participants in both groups were approximately equivalent to average
scores earned by typically developing 7–8-year-old children in the test standardization sam-
ple (Bowers, Huisingh, & LoGiudize, 2008).
 These results highlight that although significant
social skills  
improvements were found on the SRS-2, participants continue to show delays
in social  
development when compared with typically developing peers.
 The results of the
Making  
Inferences test are particularly notable since the test has similar demands to the
RMET, on which participants in both social skills groups showed significant improvement.
Like the RMET, Making Inferences required participants to detect nonverbal cues based on
a picture of a person.
 While the RMET asked participants to identify the emotional state of pic-
tured individuals’
 faces, Making Inferences required participants to take the perspective of the
Animal-assisted Social Skills Training for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders

 pictured individual and express the person’
s thought based on the context.
 The RMET results
imply that the social skills training was effective in helping participants develop the early skills
necessary to recognize the mindset of another person;
 however, the SLDT results show that
more intervention is needed to expand those skills so participants can manage increasingly
complex social demands.
 
The SLDT results point to a limitation of this study, which is that the frequency and duration
of treatment may not have been sufficient to produce change in complex social behaviors.
 
Although many social skills training programs use a similar treatment schedule, Odom, Boyd,
Hall, and Hume (2010) advocate for the use of more intensive and/
or longer interventions.
 A
 
second limitation is that in cases where both groups showed significant growth over time, it is
not possible to know whether the effects were attributable to the interventions, maturation, or
 
another factor.
One factor that was not assessed in this study, and is frequently overlooked in similar
 
research (Prothmann, Ettrich, & Prothmann, 2009), is the impact of animal sessions on the
dogs and the handlers.
 After the first few weeks of groups, the handlers began observing that
their dogs showed increased excitement when they arrived on campus.
 The dogs seemed
 
motivated to interact with the children.
 The handlers also expressed that they enjoyed groups,
specifically watching their dog participate in activities.
 Several factors likely contributed to the
inviting environment.
 These factors include the careful planning that went into recruiting dogs
with suitable temperaments and training, making sure that handlers had a quiet place to bring
the dogs if needed, and the weekly review of appropriate animal interactions.
 In fact, there
was only one instance in which a handler felt that she needed to give her dog a break during
a session.
 With the expansion of animal-assisted therapies, it is important to have standard-
ized procedures for assessing animals’
 comfort levels and to gain information about the types
of activities that are most pleasing for the handler/
dog teams that play a critical role in the
 
treatments (Burrows, Adams, & Millman, 2008).
 
The current study is one of a few recent studies on the effectiveness of AAIs for developing
social skills in children with ASD.
 As the scope of research on the use of AAIs for social skills
expands, it will be useful to consider how the different species of animals included may
 
influence the interventions.
 Although a comprehensive comparison of the benefits and
 
challenges of including each animal is beyond the scope of this paper, it is possible to
 
compare the features of the current model with dogs with other AAI models for social skills
training, such as those with horses and guinea pigs.
 Three key factors can be considered in
comparing models with different animals:
 cost, ease of implementation, and the features of
the human–animal interaction.
 Cost and ease of implementation are vital considerations,
since unaffordability and extensive implementation needs, like securing trained personnel and
suitable animals, can be barriers to implementation.
 
While research on equine-assisted therapy has indicated that it can be effective in
 
increasing social motivation and sensory seeking as well as social functioning in children with
ASD (Bass, Duchowny, & Llabre, 2009;
 Borgi et al.
, 2016), the high cost of implementing these
programs has been cited as a limitation in the treatment (Anestis, Anestis, Zawilinski,  
Hopkins,
& Lilienfeld , 2014).
 Expenses related to stabling, veterinary care, routine maintenance, and
 
facility upkeep all contribute to program costs.
 Interventions including guinea pigs in school
classrooms, like those introduced by O’
Haire and colleagues (2013), appear to offer one of
the lowest cost and easy to implement options.
 Guinea pigs are routinely able to be main-
tained as classroom pets;
 they may be safely cared for and handled by children with adult
Becker et al.
321
Anthrozoös
AZ 30(2)_Layout 1  4/30/17  10:06 PM  Page 321
  
supervision.
 In addition, it is possible to incorporate social-skills focused AAIs within the nat-
uralistic context of the classroom, which could potentially have implications for generalization
of skills as well as feasibility.
 Like working with guinea pigs, including dogs also allows for
 
implementation of social skills training in the child’
s natural environment (e.
g.
, school).
 While the
model used in the current study did not include costs related to finding, training, or maintaining
therapy dogs (which was provided by independent volunteers), it did require more administra-
tive tasks than an intervention with guinea pigs.
 These tasks overlap with those needed for
many equine programs, including finding and training volunteers and coordinating volunteer
schedules (Gabriels et al.
, 2012).
 
Aside from logistical differences, the type of animal included in the social skills training plays
a major role in the nature of the social interactions offered.
 Although research on the differences
between sensory inputs offered by riding a horse versus touching an animal is not yet avail-
able, it seems likely that the act of riding a horse offers a great deal more sensory input than
that offered by petting dogs or guinea pigs.
 Accordingly, horseback riding has been found to
engage the sensory motor system in a way that closely resembles a walking gait (Uchiyama,
Ohtani, & Ohta, 2011), and studies of equine-
assisted therapy on social functioning have found
that children with ASD show improvement in motor ability (Borgi et al.
, 2016) and decreases
in lethargy and hyperactivity (Gabriels, 2012).
 Like horses and dogs, guinea pigs allow
 
opportunities for prosocial behaviors, like grooming and caretaking;
 however, due to their small
size, acts like grooming and petting require a degree of motor control that may be difficult for
children with ASD, who often exhibit weaknesses in motor development (Fournier, Hass, Naik,
Lodha, & Cauraugh, 2010).
 Dogs are highly  
attuned and responsive to human social behav-
iors compared with other animals (Topál, Kis, & Oláh, 2014).
 Their responsiveness to human
gestures was used in the current study to  
reinforce prosocial behaviors in children in a way that
would be challenging to replicate in frequency and consistency in interventions with other
 
animals.
 For instance, in learning to make eye contact prior to a verbalization, children were
able to ask for and receive eye contact from the dog using the “watch me”
 command.
 The chil-
dren’
s eye contact behavior was  
reinforced when they were then able to ask for and engage
in a preferred interaction, such as asking for the dog’
s paw.
 As was observed in the current
study, dogs may also be helpful in engaging reluctant participants.
 Their willingness to sit qui-
etly with children who needed time to warm up to an activity or request attention from children
on the outskirts of the group seemed to provide a nonverbal support that might not be as
easy to solicit in models with other animals.
 
Overall, this study provides preliminary evidence that social skills training with dogs is an
effective approach for youth with ASD, and it seems to support the movement toward i 
ncluding
socially motivating experiences into ASD treatments.
 The largely positive results suggest the
need for more research with larger sample sizes and the inclusion of participants from various
treatment settings (e.
g.
, community schools, outpatient clinics, etc.
).
 Future research must
also aim to discover whether motivation to engage in human–animal interactions does con-
tribute to improved treatment results, as we and others have suggested.
 The problem of
 
investigating motivating factors or emotional states is particularly challenging when working
with youth with ASD, since deficits in expressive language and emotional awareness are con-
sistent with the diagnosis.
 One solution may be to expand research into the effects of human–
animal interactions on physiological changes related to stress (e.
g.
, cortisol, blood pressure),
pleasure, and social connectedness (e.
g.
, oxytocin), which will shed light onto physiological
changes that act to reinforce engagement with animals.
