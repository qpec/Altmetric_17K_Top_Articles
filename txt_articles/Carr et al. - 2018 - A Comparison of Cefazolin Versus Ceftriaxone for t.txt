Background. Cefazolin and ceftriaxone are frequently used to treat methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) bac-
teremia, especially in the realm of outpatient parenteral antimicrobial therapy. Both antimicrobials have been associated with favor-
able clinical outcomes for mixed MSSA infections. However, limited published data exist specifically comparing the use of these 
agents for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia.
Methods. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of Veteran patients with MSSA bacteremia who received ≥14 days of cefa-
zolin or ceftriaxone between 2009 and 2014. Rates of treatment failure were compared between both groups. Treatment failure was 
defined as therapy extension, incomplete therapy, unplanned oral suppressive therapy, relapse of infection, or hospital admission or 
surgery within 90 days.
Results. Out of 71 patients, 38 received treatment with cefazolin and 33 with ceftriaxone. The overall rate of treatment failure 
was 40.8%, with significantly more failures among patients receiving ceftriaxone (54.5% versus 28.9%; P = .029). Factors associated 
with treatment failure included longer duration of parenteral therapy, heart failure, and treatment in an external skilled nursing facil-
ity as compared with treatment in the Department of Veterans Affairs attached Community Living Center.
Conclusions. Ceftriaxone had a higher rate of treatment failure than cefazolin for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia in a Veteran 
population. Potential reasons for this could include the higher protein binding of ceftriaxone, ultimately resulting in lower serum 
concentrations of free drug, or other unknown factors. Further studies are warranted to confirm these results.

Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most common pathogens 
of both community and hospital-acquired bacteremia [1]. The 
high rate of recurrence of S. aureus bacteremia after completion 
of antistaphylococcal therapy, ranging from 5% to 23%, neces-
sitates an extended duration of parenteral therapy to reduce the 
potential for recurrence and subsequent morbidity and mor-
tality [2, 3]. Due to the extended duration of parenteral therapy 
that is required to effectively treat bacteremia, outpatient par-
enteral antimicrobial therapy (OPAT) has become popular 
to reduce hospital length of stay and treatment costs [4]. 
Compared with antistaphylococcal penicillins for the manage-
ment of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) 
infections, cefazolin and ceftriaxone have found similar rates 
of treatment failure and low numbers of adverse events, thus 
making them viable alternatives [5–12]. Although cefazolin 
has been reported in vitro to be subject to an inoculum effect 
due to hydrolysis by S. aureus beta-lactamases, limited data 
exist regarding effects on clinical outcomes associated with 
this phenomenon [13–16]. Cefazolin and ceftriaxone also offer 
more convenient dosing than antistaphylococcal penicillins, 
which makes them an attractive option in the realm of OPAT 
[4]. Limited data exist comparing cefazolin and ceftriaxone for 
MSSA infections, and to the authors’ knowledge, this is the first 
study that compares cefazolin versus ceftriaxone head-to-head 
specifically for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia. We com-
pared the rates of treatment failure between cefazolin and cef-
triaxone when used for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia. 
Secondary objectives included rates of overall 90-day mortality, 
Clostridium difficile infection, adverse events, and the cost of 
parenteral therapy.

Subjects with a diagnosis of MSSA bacteremia from January 
2009 to August 2014 were identified from the institution’s 
OPAT registry. Subjects were eligible for inclusion if they 
were treated for MSSA bacteremia with cefazolin or ceftri-
axone for ≥14 days. Patients were excluded if they received 
OPAT with another antistaphylococcal antimicrobial in 
addition to cefazolin or ceftriaxone (with the exception of 
patients with a prosthesis or mycotic aneurysm), if they had 
documented polymicrobial infection, if they had received 
empiric antimicrobials >72 hours after cultures were final-
ized, or if OPAT was not being used as a curative modality. 
Patient charts were reviewed through the VA’s electronic 
medical record system, Computerized Patient Record 
System (CPRS). All patients were managed by an infectious 
diseases physician, who made the treatment decisions and 
determination of the source of infection. Data collected 
from each subject included patient demographics, source 
of infection, antimicrobial characteristics, duration of par-
enteral therapy, blood culture data, adverse events based 
on chart review at follow-up visits and additional hospital 
encounters, overall 90-day mortality, Clostridium difficile 
laboratory tests, treatment setting, and presence of medical 
comorbidities.
Definitions
MSSA bacteremia was defined as having at least one posi-
tive blood culture growing S. aureus susceptible to oxa-
cillin performed using VITEK 2 (BioMérieux, Inc, Durham, 
NC). Cefazolin and ceftriaxone were considered susceptible 
if S. aureus was oxacillin-susceptible. Treatment failure was 
defined as unplanned extension of parenteral antimicrobial 
therapy, failure to complete the course of parenteral therapy, 
relapse of infection within 90 days of treatment completion, 
unplanned addition of suppressive oral antimicrobial therapy 
(with the exception of patients with a prosthesis or mycotic an-
eurysm, as this was considered planned), readmission or un-
anticipated surgical intervention related to the primary site of 
infection within 90 days of treatment completion, or the pa-
tient being lost to follow-up, as treatment success could not 
be validated. Persistent bacteremia was defined as bacteremia 
that persists for ≥7 days. Relapse was defined as a repeat blood 
culture positive for MSSA obtained after antimicrobial therapy 
was completed. Source control was defined as removal of cen-
tral lines in the setting of catheter-related bloodstream infec-
tion, drainage of intra-abdominal abscesses if collections were 
present, valve replacement for patients with endocarditis, and 
amputation or debridement of skin and soft tissue or osteoar-
ticular infections. Adverse events were defined as any injury 
that directly resulted from the use of cefazolin or ceftriaxone. 
Cost of parenteral therapy was defined as the total acquisition 
cost of the parenteral therapy per patient, after adjusting for the 
final duration of parenteral treatment.
Statistical Analysis
The primary outcome of interest was treatment failure. A chi-
square test was used to compare differences in rates of treat-
ment failure based on treatment with cefazolin or ceftriaxone. 
A power analysis was conducted for a chi-square analysis. 
It was determined that a sample size of 71 participants, with 
an alpha of .05 and a power of 80%, would be able to detect a 
medium effect size of 0.33. Secondary outcomes were rates of 
overall 90-day mortality, Clostridium difficile infection, adverse 
events, and the cost of parenteral therapy. Categorical outcome 
data were compared using the chi-square test, continuous out-
come data were compared using a t test, and logistic regression 
was used to assess variables predictive of treatment failure. 
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 20 (IBM 
SPSS, Chicago, IL). The study was approved by the Louis Stokes 
Cleveland Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center 
Institutional Review Board prior to data collection.
RESULTS
Baseline Demographics
From January 2009 to August 2014, 71 patients in the OPAT 
registry were treated with cefazolin or ceftriaxone for MSSA 
bacteremia. Thirty-eight (54%) received treatment with cefazo-
lin, and 33 (46%) received treatment with ceftriaxone (Table 1). 
Patients receiving hemodialysis and the presence of a prosthesis 
were significantly more likely in the cefazolin group, but there 
were no other significant differences in baseline characteristics 
between the groups. Patients were predominantly male, and 
the mean age was 63 years for the cefazolin group and 64 years

for the ceftriaxone group. Intravenous drug use was the only 
comorbid disease state that differed significantly between treat-
ment groups as cefazolin was favored, 13% versus 0%.
Treatment and Infection Characteristics
Duration of parenteral therapy was similar between the cefa-
zolin and ceftriaxone groups (37.8 days versus 38.1 days; 
P = .938) (Table 2). The majority of patients received 2-g 
doses of cefazolin and ceftriaxone, 95% and 88%, respec-
tively. Significant differences in the primary source of bacter-
emia between the treatment groups was not evident; however, 
there was a trend toward more patients in the cefazolin group 
having an associated endovascular source of infection and 
more patients in the ceftriaxone group having skin and soft 
tissue infection. Overall, osteoarticular infection was the 
most common associated infection, followed by an endo-
vascular source, with a total of 7 patients having presumed 
endocarditis, per the infectious diseases physician and echo-
cardiogram. Rates for the achievement of source control did 
not differ significantly between cefazolin and ceftriaxone (20 
[56%] versus 19 [58%], P = .631], respectively. Time to blood 
culture clearance was similar between cefazolin and ceftriax-
one (2.8 days versus 3.5 days, P = .276). Additionally, there 
were no significant differences between treatment groups for 
the rate of blood culture clearance within 72 hours (cefazolin 
26 [74%] versus ceftriaxone 21 [66%], P = .439) and persis-
tent bacteremia (cefazolin 1 [3%] versus ceftriaxone 1 [3%], 
P = .949).
Outcomes
Of the 71 patients with MSSA bacteremia, there were 29 
overall treatment failures (Table 3). Rates of treatment failure 
were higher in the ceftriaxone group than the cefazolin group 
(18 [55%] versus 11 [29%], P = .029). Of the reasons that 
accounted for treatment failure, only extension of parenteral 
therapy and incomplete course of parenteral therapy were 
significantly different between treatment groups. Extension 
of parenteral therapy (ceftriaxone 7 [21%] versus cefazolin 
0 [0%], P = .003) was secondary to 2 patients who required 
additional source control and 5 patients who had persistent 
signs and symptoms of infection that required the duration 
to be extended. An incomplete course of parenteral therapy 
(ceftriaxone 0 [0%] versus cefazolin 5 [13%], P = .031) was 
secondary to 2 patients with adverse events that required 
change in therapy, 2 patients who died before therapy com-
pletion, and 1 patient who had therapy modified due to 
development of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium 
bacteremia. There was a trend toward greater overall 90-day 
mortality in the cefazolin-treated group compared with those 
treated with ceftriaxone (11% versus 3%). The rate of C. dif-
ficile infection between the treatment groups was not differ-
ent. Adverse events were similar in the treatment groups. The 
ceftriaxone group did not have any changes in therapy due to 
an adverse event, whereas the cefazolin group had 1 patient 
change therapy due to rash and urticaria and another patient 
change therapy due to neutropenia. Ceftriaxone had a slightly 
higher cost for a complete course of parenteral therapy per 
patient than cefazolin ($868.72 versus $760.80).
The majority of the patients received OPAT in the home set-
ting (Table 4). The only significant differences in treatment fail-
ures based on location were between those patients treated in 
the VA’s attached Community Living Center (CLC) and exter-
nal skilled nursing facilities (SNFs), 17% and 71% (P = .008), 
respectively. Other factors that were found to be predictive of 
treatment failure included longer duration of parenteral therapy 
(OR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.01–1.1; P = .015) and heart failure (OR, 
7.93; 95% CI, 2.43–25.92; P < .001) (Table 5).

DISCUSSION
Our hospital and many others frequently use cefazolin and cef-
triaxone for MSSA bacteremia due to more convenient dosing 
and perceived lower number of adverse events than antistaph-
ylococcal penicillins. Additionally, previous studies have found 
similar favorable treatment outcomes with cefazolin or ceftriax-
one as an alternative to antistaphylococcal penicillins for MSSA 
infections [4–6]. To our knowledge, this is the first trial that 
has compared cefazolin versus ceftriaxone head-to-head specif-
ically for the treatment of MSSA bacteremia [10, 11].
We found higher rates of treatment failure with ceftriaxone, 
whereas multiple previously published retrospective stud-
ies have not described differences in treatment failure rates 
between cefazolin and ceftriaxone for various MSSA infections. 
Winans et al. showed similar favorable clinical outcomes for 
cefazolin and ceftriaxone in 122 patients treated for various 
types of MSSA infections (67.9% and 79.5%, P = .17, respec-
tively) [10]. In another evaluation, Patel et al. described similar 
clinical cure rates comparing ceftriaxone with standard of care 
therapy, which included cefazolin, vancomycin, and nafcillin, 
in 93 Veteran patients treated for various types of MSSA infec-
tions (83.3% and 74.5%, P = .303, respectively) [11]. Higher 
rates of treatment failure with third-generation cephalosporins, 
ceftriaxone, and cefotaxime for MSSA bacteremia have been 
reported, but these data by Paul et al. included both cefazolin 
and cloxacillin as a single comparator [12]. In this study, higher 
30-day mortality rates with third-generation cephalosporins 
were found when compared with cloxacillin/cefazolin therapy 
(OR, 2.24; 95% CI, 1.23–4.08; P = .008). Our study had similar 
rates of treatment failure in the cefazolin treatment group com-
pared with previous studies.
Although definitive conclusions regarding the reasons for 
higher treatment failure rates with ceftriaxone are not known, 
several possibilities exist. Firstly, although other studies have 
evaluated various types of MSSA infections with or without 
bacteremia, our study solely focused on the rates of treatment 
failure in MSSA bacteremia, thus reducing the variability in 
treatment between multiple disease states without a subsequent 
bacteremia. From a biological plausibility standpoint, it is pos-
sible that the differing MIC distributions between ceftriaxone 
and cefazolin [17] and/or the higher protein binding mani-
fested by ceftriaxone resulting in lower serum-free drug con-
centration could contribute to treatment failure [18]. Secondly, 
another possibility is that there were more patients treated with 
cefazolin in the VA’s attached CLC than those treated with cef-
triaxone, 34% and 15%, respectively. Conversely, more patients 
in the ceftriaxone group were treated at an external SNF than 
those treated with cefazolin, 30% and 11%, respectively. Of 
those patients treated at an external SNF, there were 9 treat-
ment failures in the ceftriaxone group and 1 treatment failure 
in the cefazolin group. The differences in treatment failure rates 
based on the location of treatment in the VA’s attached CLC 
and external SNF could be due to closer monitoring of ther-
apy and the availability of infectious diseases physicians in the 
VA’s CLC.
Our study has several limitations. Firstly, our analysis is ret-
rospective, and it is possible that unknown variables could have 
affected the results, for instance, the clinical factors that led to 
the choice between cefazolin and ceftriaxone by the infectious 
diseases physician, such as the source of infection. Although 
the predominant source of infection in both groups was oste-
oarticular infections, skin and soft tissue was the second most 
frequent source of infection in the ceftriaxone group, whereas 
endovascular infection was the second most frequent source in 
the cefazolin group. The differences in the source of infection 
could explain why the overall duration of parenteral therapy was 
similar between the groups despite ceftriaxone having the dur-
ation of parenteral therapy extended more often than cefazolin. 
This could illustrate the infectious diseases physicians’ prefer-
ence at our site to use ceftriaxone in patients with an uncom-
plicated bacteremia who would generally be able to receive a 
shorter duration of therapy. Secondly, although all patients had 
MSSA bacteremia, many patients may have had a metastatic foci

of infection as a result of bacteremia that could have resulted 
in a higher number of treatment failures. However, significant 
differences were not found in the primary source of infection 
or rate of source control between treatment groups that would 
have favored cefazolin over ceftriaxone, and the overall duration 
of parenteral therapy was similar between both groups. As the 
majority of patients met criteria for complicated bacteremia, 
the duration of therapy was similar to the recommended dur-
ation of therapy for complicated bacteremia of 4–6 weeks, per 
the Infectious Diseases Society of America methicillin-resistant 
Staphylococcus aureus guidelines [19]. Lastly, patients who were 
planned to have OPAT with ceftriaxone were occasionally given 
cefazolin until discharge from the hospital. Cefazolin is more 
commonly used for MSSA infections in acute care because the 
difference in convenience between once-daily and every-8-hour 
regimens are not as impactful; therefore, strictly looking at those 
who received ceftriaxone or cefazolin for the full duration would 
have substantially reduced the sample size in this retrospective 
study. Treatment durations were accounted for in the analysis; 
however, there were no patients who received more than 7 days 
of cefazolin before being placed on OPAT with ceftriaxone.
In conclusion, our study results suggest that cefazolin may be 
preferred to ceftriaxone for MSSA bacteremia in a high-acuity 
Veteran population, based on higher rates of treatment failure in 
the ceftriaxone group. Further research, preferably prospective, 
randomized clinical trials, are needed to validate that ceftri-
axone may not be a suitable alternative to cefazolin for MSSA 
bacteremia, as previous retrospective studies have found similar 
clinical outcomes between cefazolin and ceftriaxone when used 
for various MSSA infections.
