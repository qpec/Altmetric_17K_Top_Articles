REVIEW
The effects of probiotics on depressive 
symptoms in humans: a systematic review
Caroline J. K. Wallace* and Roumen Milev
Abstract 
Background: Patients suffering from depression experience significant mood, anxiety, and cognitive symptoms. 
Currently, most antidepressants work by altering neurotransmitter activity in the brain to improve these symptoms. 
However, in the last decade, research has revealed an extensive bidirectional communication network between the 
gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system, referred to as the “gut–brain axis.” Advances in this field have 
linked psychiatric disorders to changes in the microbiome, making it a potential target for novel antidepressant treat-
ments. The aim of this review is to analyze the current body of research assessing the effects of probiotics, on symp-
toms of depression in humans.
Methods: A systematic search of five databases was performed and study selection was completed using the pre-
ferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses process.
Results: Ten studies met criteria and were analyzed for effects on mood, anxiety, and cognition. Five studies assessed 
mood symptoms, seven studies assessed anxiety symptoms, and three studies assessed cognition. The majority of the 
studies found positive results on all measures of depressive symptoms; however, the strain of probiotic, the dosing, 
and duration of treatment varied widely and no studies assessed sleep.
Conclusion: The evidence for probiotics alleviating depressive symptoms is compelling but additional double-blind 
randomized control trials in clinical populations are warranted to further assess efficacy.

Background
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychi-
atric disorder of unknown etiology that will affect up to 
20% of the population at some point in their lifetime [1], 
and is a leading cause of disability worldwide [2]. Charac-
terized by low mood or loss of interest and often accom-
panied by feelings of guilt, hopelessness, and changes 
in appetite and sleep, MDD significantly impairs daily 
functioning—including work and school performance 
and social relationships. Depressive symptoms can also 
be present subclinically, and still have a major impact on 
daily functioning. Currently, most pharmacological treat-
ments for MDD focus on altering neurotransmitter activ-
ity in the brain, but have a delayed onset of action and 
can produce adverse side effects such as headaches, nau-
sea, agitation, sedation, and sexual dysfunction [3]. How-
ever, in the last decade, neurogastroenterology research 
has revealed extensive and direct biochemical signaling 
between the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the central 
nervous system, referred to as the “gut–brain axis.” This 
communication network is bidirectional and occurs via 
the autonomic nervous system, the enteric nervous sys-
tem, the neuroendocrine system, and the immune system 
[4]. These advances have linked central nervous system 
psychiatric disorders such as MDD to changes in the 
gastrointestinal microbiome [5–7], making it a potential 
target for novel antidepressant treatments. This is further 
corroborated by the high rate of comorbidity between 
psychiatric disorders and GI disorders [8].
The microbiome, a complex microbial ecosystem con-
taining some 100 trillion microorganisms, functions to 
establish the intestinal lining and aids in its maintenance

[9]. It is influenced by several factors, including genet-
ics [10], age [11], sex [12], diet [13], and, of particular 
interest lately, stress [14]. There is already evidence that 
psychological stress can increase permeability of the gas-
trointestinal lining [15], and conversely, mounting evi-
dence that the microbiome can influence and modulate 
emotional behavior [16]. As a stress- and emotion-related 
disorder, this association has led depression researchers 
to explore the potential of manipulating the microbiome 
of the GI tract to alleviate depressive symptoms.
Nutritional psychiatry is an emerging field of psychia-
try that explores the relationship between dietary pat-
terns and risk of mental health disorders. The brain’s 
structure and function is dependent on nutrient intake—
including amino acids, fats, vitamins, minerals [17], thus 
diet has emerged as a compelling candidate in regulating 
mental health [18]. Several cross-sectional studies have 
used an overall diet approach to evaluate the association 
between nutrition and mental health [19, 20] but there 
is also considerable research looking at isolated nutri-
ents and their impact on mental health. Central to this 
research are probiotics, defined as live microorganisms 
that, when ingested in adequate amounts, exert a health 
benefit on the host [21]. Probiotics are transient entities 
that colonize the GI tract and influence various pathways 
and are available as a supplement in pill or powder form. 
It has been well established that probiotics have thera-
peutic effects on many GI disorders [22]; however, with 
the emergence of the gut–brain axis, it has been discov-
ered that their therapeutic effects extend beyond the gut 
and into the central nervous system [23]. There is robust 
evidence of this in preclinical studies that have demon-
strated probiotics’ ability to change behavior and improve 
the mood, anxiety, and cognition of rodents by altering 
neurotransmitter activity, reviewed below.
Preclinical studies
In terms of neurotransmission, several rodent stud-
ies found that consumption of probiotics prevented 
stress-induced increases in adrenocorticotropic hor-
mone (ACTH) [24], corticosterone [25, 26], adrenaline, 
and noradrenaline [25]. The reduction in these markers 
of chronic stress suggests that treatment with probiotics 
attenuated the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) 
axis, which is hyperactive in depressed patients [27]. 
Consumption of probiotics was also shown to increase 
expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
[25], a growth factor crucial for brain plasticity, memory, 
and neuronal health [28] that is abnormally reduced in 
patients suffering from depression [29]. Other preclini-
cal studies have noted changes in the molecules involved 
in the biosynthesis and metabolism of the critical neuro-
transmitter serotonin. Desbonnet and colleagues found 
that consumption of probiotics increased plasma lev-
els of serotonin’s precursor, tryptophan [30], and, along 
with Nishino’s group [31], decreased serotonin’s main 
metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), simi-
lar to the antidepressant citalopram. These findings sug-
gest that probiotics have a positive impact on the central 
nervous system by regulating critical neurotransmitters 
implicated in depression. And the central nervous sys-
tem is not the only physiological system implicated in 
depression that probiotics have been shown to influence 
in rodents: consumption of probiotics reduced levels of 
the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1-beta (IL-
1β) [24, 32] and interleukin-6 (IL-6), as well as tumor 
necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) [24] and microglial activa-
tion markers [25], indicating they may possess the ability 
to reduce overall inflammation. Finally, one of the most 
salient findings in preclinical studies of rodents treated 
with probiotics are the behavioral and psychological 
changes they induce, such as improved memory [33, 34] 
and reduced anxiety- and depressive-like behaviors [26, 
32, 35, 36].
Probiotics have also been shown to possess both anti-
oxidant and free radical scavenging abilities [37], increase 
production of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [38], 
and improve absorption of other nutrients [39], all of 
which have been implicated in the pathophysiology of 
depression. Moreover, in Western societies, depres-
sion is more common among low socioeconomic status 
populations, who have also been shown to consume less 
probiotics and fermented foods than their higher SES 
counterparts, who also experience less depression [40].
These results, along with preclinical and clinical study 
findings, suggest that gut microbiota and the use of 
probiotics could prove useful in alleviating depressive 
symptoms. The objective of this review is to analyze the 
current body of research assessing the effects of probiot-
ics on symptoms of depression in humans such as mood, 
anxiety, and cognition, and to identify any gaps and dis-
cuss future directions in this field.
Methods
Study selection criteria
Articles eligible for inclusion in this review were written 
or available in English and published in peer-reviewed 
journals. Conference publications, book chapters, letters, 
and reviews were excluded. The studies included in the 
review were restricted to human trials that assessed sub-
jective changes in symptoms of depression such as mood, 
anxiety, and/or cognition after consuming either a probi-
otic supplement or a food or drink containing probiotic 
cultures for an extended period of time. Studies were 
excluded if investigating GI dysfunctions.

Search strategy
A systematic computerized search was performed using 
the following databases: Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, 
cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature 
(CINAHL), and web of science (WoS). A supplementary 
search of Google Scholar was also performed to ensure 
no studies were omitted. Key words included depres-
sion, mood disorder, emotions, probiotics, Lactobacillus, 
Bifidobacterium, and gut–brain axis. The results of the 
search process are described below (Fig. 1).
Selection of studies
Study selection was completed using the PRISMA 
(preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and 
meta-analyses) process (Fig. 1). One author (C.W.) com-
pleted initial screening to exclude irrelevant titles, and 
remaining abstracts and subsequent remaining full-text 
articles were independently screened by both authors 
(C.W. and R. M.) for eligibility in the review. Any disa-
greement was resolved by discussion between the two 
authors.
Quality control of selected studies
Quality of included clinical trials was assessed using the 
Jadad Scale [41], a widely used scoring system that inde-
pendently assesses the methodological quality of trials 
on three measures: randomization, blinding, and with-
drawals/dropouts. Trials are scored on a five-point scale 
and for the purpose of quality control for this review, 
articles with a score of three or higher were included. All 
included articles met these criteria. Scores ranged from 
3 to 5 with a mean score of 4.1 (n = 7). Three additional

studies that did not follow a double-blind randomized 
control trial design were also included due to their sound 
methodology and analysis of the outcomes as well as to 
provide the most comprehensive review of the literature.
Results
This review includes ten studies from five databases listed 
above. Characteristics of each study are shown in Table 1. 
The most frequently used probiotic strain was Lactobacil-
lus casei, and duration of treatment period ranged from 
3 weeks to 6 months. One study assessed patients with 
depression, two studies assessed adults suffering from 
stress or exhaustion and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), 
respectively, and the remaining seven studies assessed 
healthy controls.
Effects on mood
Of the ten included studies, five assessed mood symp-
toms and all but two reported improvements after treat-
ment with a probiotic. Benton and colleagues’ 2007 
double-blind randomized control trial with 124 healthy 
humans found that after only 20 days of consuming a 
probiotic-containing milk drink, although having no 
effect on the profile of mood states (POMS) scale, par-
ticipants whose self-rated mood was initially poor had 
improved [42]. Following Benton, Rao and colleagues 
conducted a study with 35 patients suffering from CFS 
who were randomly assigned to receive a probiotic or 
placebo three times daily for 2 months. Depressive and 
anxiety symptoms were assessed with the Beck Depres-
sion Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory 
(BAI) pre- and post-intervention, and results showed 
that while consumption of the probiotic improved anxi-
ety scores, it had no effect on depressive symptoms [43]. 
Similarly, Young-Chul Chung and colleagues imple-
mented a 12-week, double-blind randomized controlled 
experiment with healthy 60–75 year olds and found no 
significant improvement in geriatric depression scale 
(GDS-SF) scores after treatment with a probiotic fer-
mented milk [44]. However, Messaoudi and colleagues’ 
2011 research on healthy humans found that consump-
tion of a probiotic supplement reduced somatisation, 
depression, and anger-hostility scores on the Hopkins 
symptom checklist (HSCL-90), as well as reduced Hos-
pital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) global scores 
[36]. Steenbergen and colleagues then went on to con-
duct a triple-blind (blind at three levels: group allocator, 
participants, and outcome assessor) randomized con-
trol trial assessing the effects of probiotics on cognitive 
reactivity to sad mood using the Leiden index of depres-
sion sensitivity (LEIDS-r). Forty healthy young adults 
consumed either a probiotic supplement or placebo for 
4 weeks and found that consumption of the multispecies 
probiotic formula significantly reduced overall cogni-
tive reactivity to depression, in particular aggressive and 
ruminative thoughts [45]. Finally, and most recently, 
Akkasheh and colleagues [46] designed a double-blind 
randomized placebo-controlled trial with 40 patients 
diagnosed with depression. Participants consumed either 
a probiotic supplement or placebo for 8 weeks and were 
assessed using the BDI at baseline and post-treatment. 
Results showed that consumption of the probiotic sup-
plement significantly decreased BDI scores indicating 
overall improved symptoms including mood.
Effects on stress and anxiety
Seven of the ten included studies assessed anxiety and 
stress, and all but two reported improvements after treat-
ment with a probiotic. In addition to mood, Rao and 
colleagues, Chung and colleagues, and Messaoudi and 
colleagues also assessed stress and/or anxiety. As men-
tioned above, Rao and colleagues found that consump-
tion of probiotics significantly improved anxiety, reflected 
in lower BAI scores [43]. However, when Chung and col-
leagues assessed stress in their older adult sample, there 
was no significant change in perceived stress scale (PSS) 
scores [44]. Similarly, Messaoudi and colleagues’ 2011 
study also found no significant change on PSS scores after 
the introduction of their probiotic supplement, but sec-
ondary analyses showed that the reduced HSCL-90 and 
HADS scores held up in a subset of subjects with the low-
est levels of stress, as measured by urinary free cortisol 
(UFC) levels [47]. Moreover, Gruenwald and colleagues’ 
6-month study evaluating the effects of a probiotic mul-
tivitamin in 42 adults suffering from stress and exhaus-
tion found that participants’ general condition improved 
by 41%, with a mean increase of 17% in positive condition 
and a mean decrease of 23% in negative condition [48]. 
Improvement in general condition of 22% was apparent 
by month 2 and reached 36% by month 4, with values 
for activity, elation, fatigue, and agitation contributing to 
these changes. 73% of participants rated the treatment’s 
effect as “good” or “very good” [36]. In 2004, Marcos and 
colleagues examined the effects of yogurt cultures with 
added probiotics on subjects under academic examina-
tion stress, and while numbers of lymphocytes and CD56 
cells increased and decreased, respectively, levels of stress 
and anxiety, assessed using the state-trait anxiety inven-
tory (STAI) remained unchanged [49]. Recently, Matthew 
Hilimire and colleagues took a different approach and 
surveyed 710 young adults using self-report question-
naires on fermented food consumption as well as neu-
roticism and social anxiety, using the big five inventory 
(BFI) and the social phobia and anxiety inventory (SPAI-
23). The results showed that consumption of fermented 
foods containing probiotics was negatively associated

with symptoms of social anxiety, and that consumption 
of fermented foods interacts with neuroticism to predict 
social anxiety symptoms. Those at higher genetic risk 
for social anxiety (indexed by high neuroticism) showed 
fewer social anxiety symptoms when they consumed 
more fermented foods [50].
Effects on cognition
Three studies assessed some aspect of cognition, and all 
three of them reported positive effects. Messaoudi and 
colleagues assessed coping, defined as ‘the various cog-
nitive or behavioral effects intended to master or toler-
ate the internal or external demands which threaten or 
go beyond the resources of a subject,
’ with the coping 
checklist (CCL), and demonstrated that consumption 
of probiotics reduced self-blame scores and increased 
focus on problem-solving [36]. Chung and colleagues 
assessed cognition using the digit-span test (DST; to 
measure attention and working memory), story recall 
test (SRT), and verbal-learning test (VLT; to measure 
short- and long-term memory), as well as a rapid visual 
information-processing (RVIP) task and Stroop color-
word test to measure cognitive fatigue. Results found a 
significant improvement on cognitive fatigue measures 
in those treated with the probiotic-fermented milk [44]. 
Interestingly, Benton and colleagues found no effect of 
the probiotic-containing milk drink on memory scores 
as measured with the Wechsler Memory Scale, but sub-
jects who consumed the placebo had significantly better 
memory scores post-treatment. There was also no effect 
on verbal fluency [42].
Discussion
Taken together, the findings from the included stud-
ies demonstrate that it is likely that daily consumption 
of a probiotic supplement could have a positive effect 
in improving the mood, anxiety, and cognitive symp-
toms present in MDD. The majority of the studies found 
positive results with no serious adverse events being 
reported. It appears that probiotics may have the most 
significant effect on symptoms of anxiety, which is often 
co-morbid with MDD [1]. This is consistent with research 
in animal models that report similar findings [26, 32, 35, 
36], and in accordance with HPA activity in anxiety dis-
orders. The sample characteristics from each study varied 
slightly. Seven studies assessed healthy controls, with one 
assessing MDD patients, one assessing CFS patients, and 
one assessing participants who were experiencing severe 
stress or exhaustion. All ten studies assessed adults, male 
and female, with some specifically focusing on young 
adults or older adults, but all between the age range of 
18–75 years. Disparities in gender and age effects of pro-
biotics are not well understood.
Alternative treatment?
The use of probiotics as an alternative or adjuvant treat-
ment for relieving symptoms of MDD and anxiety could 
be a critical turning point in the management of the dis-
order [23]. Because MDD is such a heterogeneous disor-
der, several problems exist with current antidepressant 
medications. While the physiological effects of most 
antidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake 
inhibitors (SSRIs), occur immediately after administra-
tion of the drug, the therapeutic effect can take weeks 
to become apparent in those seeking relief from symp-
toms. Even when they start to become effective, the side 
effects associated with them cause an estimated 15–30% 
of patients to discontinue their use [51]. Moreover, the 
perceived stigma associated with MDD and the use of 
antidepressants prevents individuals from seeking and 
adhering to treatment [52]. Several new terms have been 
introduced into the realm of mental health treatment and 
the gut–brain axis, which should not be confused with 
probiotics. Encephalobiotics, for example, is an umbrella 
term that encompasses probiotics, prebiotics, postbiot-
ics, microbes, microbial parts, and/or agents that influ-
ence the microbiome for cognition, mental well-being, 
and brain health [53]. Psychobiotics on the other hand 
have been defined by Dinan and colleagues as live organ-
isms that, when ingested in adequate amounts, produce 
a health benefit in patients suffering from psychiatric ill-
ness [54]. Psychobiotics would thus be classified as highly 
regulated drugs and may still harbor stigma the way an 
over-the-counter probiotic supplement may not.
Using probiotics to alleviate symptoms of MDD 
could indeed eliminate some of these barriers for effec-
tive treatment, though there is still much to be accom-
plished before probiotics can be considered a front-line 
treatment for alleviating depressive symptoms, including 
investigating the mechanisms underlying their effects.
Proposed mechanisms of action
Throughout the literature, there appear to be two domi-
nant hypotheses addressing possible mechanisms of 
action through which probiotics exert their effects on 
mood and cognition. These theories involve the regula-
tion of inflammatory markers and the neurotransmis-
sion of the previously mentioned serotonin. However, as 
the immune system, central nervous system, and enteric 
nervous system are so intricately connected, it is possible 
that these two proposed mechanisms work in tandem to 
produce the effects induced by probiotics.
Inflammatory markers
Increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines 
IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, as well as interferon gamma (IFN-
γ), and C-reactive protein (CRP) is repeatedly observed 
 Page 7 of 10
Wallace and Milev  
Ann Gen Psychiatry  (2017) 16:14 
in patients suffering from depression [55–57] and has 
been associated with specific symptoms of depression 
[58, 59]. This overall increase in inflammation contrib-
utes to depressive symptoms by activating the HPA axis, 
as well as reducing the availability of neurotransmitter 
precursors and altering neurotransmitter metabolism. 
It is hypothesized that this inflammation is caused by 
increased intestinal permeability, or “leaky gut.
” When 
the tight junctions of the gastrointestinal lining become 
compromised and permeability increases, it allows toxins 
and other forms of waste to leak into the bloodstream. 
Namely, gut-derived endotoxins called lipopolysaccha-
rides (LPS)—molecules found in the outer membrane 
of gram-negative bacteria. These endotoxins trigger 
immune activation through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) 
[60], causing the body to mount a global immune 
response. It is hypothesized that probiotics may exert 
their therapeutic effects on the central nervous system 
by improving the integrity of the gastrointestinal lining, 
reducing the ability of endotoxins to leak into the blood-
stream and in turn, decreasing global inflammation. The 
reduction of this inflammation may result in improved 
regulation of the HPA axis and neurotransmitter activity.
Serotonin
Serotonin, or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), is a mono-
amine neurotransmitter implicated in the aetiology and 
pathophysiology of MDD [61] and is the main target of 
SSRIs. Serotonin is biosynthesized from the essential 
amino acid tryptophan, both in the central nervous sys-
tem and the gastrointestinal tract. In the central nerv-
ous system, it is involved primarily in regulating stress 
and emotions, appetite, and sleep. In the gastrointestinal 
tract, it is responsible for key functions such as gastro-
intestinal motility and intestinal secretions. Alterations 
in the microbiome have been shown to profoundly influ-
ence neurotransmission of serotonin in both the periph-
eral and central nervous system. It is hypothesized that 
probiotics in the GI tract improve central nervous system 
symptoms associated with MDD by increasing produc-
tion of free tryptophan, and in turn increasing serotonin 
availability. This increase in serotonin may facilitate regu-
lation of the HPA axis and reduce depressive symptoms 
caused by a depletion of the neurotransmitter.
Gaps in current research
Gaps and inconsistencies in the research on the effects 
of probiotics on depressive symptoms make it difficult 
to confirm evidence of efficacy. Duration of intervention 
varies widely, as does the quantity and strains of the pro-
biotics, and research is lacking on depressive symptoms 
apart from mood, anxiety, and cognition, such as sleep. 
Perhaps most notably are the inconsistencies in defining 
depression across studies.
Strains
There are many different species and strains of probiot-
ics that inhabit your gut and that are readily available in 
certain foods and in supplements alike, but the beneficial 
effects on health that probiotics confer are species- and 
strain-specific. Many Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium 
strains have been studied in respect to mental health and 
seem to show the most beneficial effects [62], as opposed 
to other species such as Streptococcus and Bacillus, but 
we have not yet identified the most efficacious strains 
or combinations of strains for improving mental health. 
Both L. helveticus and B. longum have been shown to 
affect the gut–brain axis [63], but several studies explor-
ing other strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium 
and garner similar results. However, many of these stud-
ies use a combination of strains, making it impossible to 
isolate which strain or strains may be exerting the effects. 
Further research in the form of blinded and controlled 
studies assessing individual strains is required to identify 
strains that may have positive effects on mental health.
Dosing
 Probiotic dosing is based on the number of live organ-
isms, referred to as colony forming units (CFU). Dosage 
may be species- and strain-dependent, with some spe-
cies such as Bifidobacterium infantis 35,624 requiring 
108 CFU to produce beneficial effects to treat irritable 
bowel syndrome [64], but research is lacking on effec-
tive dosages for other species. It is also important to note 
that most prescribed doses are based on the treatment of 
GI disorders, and given that dosing may depend on the 
indication the probiotics are being prescribed for, they 
could differ for effective relief of depressive symptoms. 
After determining the most efficacious strains for mental 
health purposes, we then need to assess the strains in dif-
ferent doses to determine the ideal amount of CFU.
Duration of intervention
The duration of intervention with probiotics varies 
widely. While typical antidepressant clinical trials last 
approximately 6 weeks [65], the ideal duration to see spe-
cific effects of probiotics is unknown. As with the strain 
and dosing, it is possible that duration of treatment is 
also dependent on indication.
Sleep
Impaired sleep is a poignant symptom of MDD, most 
commonly manifested in difficulty falling asleep, dif-
ficulty staying asleep, unrefreshing sleep, and daytime

sleepiness [66]. Serotonin, which is dysregulated in MDD, 
is a neuromodulator of sleep. Considering probiotics in 
the GI tract have been shown to affect levels of serotonin 
via the gut–brain axis, and changes in intestinal microbi-
ota have been shown to improve sleep parameters in CFS 
patients [67], it seems likely that probiotics could have an 
effect on sleep as well, yet this has not been explored.
Defining depression
Depression is an umbrella term for several different disor-
ders, including MDD, bipolar disorder, seasonal affective 
disorder, dysthymia, and postpartum depression. These 
disorders are not simply a passing low mood, but signifi-
cantly interfere in daily life and normal functioning, and 
although they do have overlapping symptoms, are each 
unique disorders. In most of the studies, the term ‘depres-
sion’ is poorly defined or not clarified. It is important that 
the type of depression is clearly defined so that it can be 
differentiated from other types of depressive disorders 
as well as sub-clinical depressive symptoms. Research on 
sub-clinical depression is equally important, as low-grade 
depressive symptoms also significantly affect performance 
at work [68], cause household, social, and financial strain 
[69], and are associated with decreased quality of life [70] 
and suicidal ideation [71]. These subsyndromal depressions 
are often ignored in research or not defined adequately.
Conclusions and future directions
The robust evidence compiled and presented in this 
review indicates that treatment with probiotics may 
improve symptoms associated with MDD by increasing 
serotonin availability and/or decreasing levels of inflam-
matory markers. The potential of probiotics to be used 
as a novel treatment for MDD could have a major impact 
on those seeking antidepressant treatment by reducing 
the stigma, latency and side effects associated with typi-
cal antidepressants. Despite extensive preclinical data, 
the clinical effects of probiotics on mental health have yet 
to be studied comprehensively in a sample of depressed 
patients. Further research is warranted to determine 
probiotics’ efficacy for alleviating depressive symptoms, 
as well as the ideal duration of treatment, dosage, and 
strain of probiotic for achieving efficacy in terms of men-
tal health. In addition, the effect of probiotics on sleep 
should be explored and the term depression should be 
clearly defined and diagnosed. Additional double-blind 
randomized controlled trials in clinical psychiatric sam-
ples are required in order to shed more light on this topic.
