The maternally inherited alpha-proteobacterium Wolbachia has been proposed as a tool to
block transmission of devastating mosquito-borne infectious diseases like dengue and
malaria. Here we study the reproductive manipulations induced by a recently identified
Wolbachia strain that stably infects natural mosquito populations of a major malaria vector,
Anopheles coluzzii, in Burkina Faso. We determine that these infections significantly accelerate
egg laying but do not induce cytoplasmic incompatibility or sex-ratio distortion, two parasitic
reproductive phenotypes that facilitate the spread of other Wolbachia strains within insect
hosts. Analysis of 221 blood-fed A. coluzzii females collected from houses shows a negative
correlation between the presence of Plasmodium parasites and Wolbachia infection.
A mathematical model incorporating these results predicts that infection with these
endosymbionts may reduce malaria prevalence in human populations. These data suggest
that Wolbachia may be an important player in malaria transmission dynamics in Sub-Saharan
Africa.

very year nearly 200 million people contract malaria and
around 450,000 people die from the disease, mostly young
children in Sub-Saharan Africa1. Malaria transmission
depends on the complex ecological determinants that drive
population dynamics of Anopheles mosquitoes, the vectors of
human malaria parasites. Measures aimed at the mosquito vector
have been the mainstay of malaria control strategies1,2 and have
achieved significant decreases in the global burden of this disease
over the last decade, primarily attributable to the widespread use
of
long-lasting
insecticide-treated
nets
(LLINs)3.
However,
insecticide-based prevention tools are severely threatened by the
rapid spread and global distribution of insecticide resistance
in anopheline populations4,5, making the development of new
insecticide-free tools for reducing malaria transmission a crucial
priority6.
The use of Wolbachia bacteria—intracellular endosymbionts of
arthropods and nematodes—has long been suggested for the
control of mosquito populations transmitting viral or parasitic
pathogens such as dengue fever and malaria, given their profound
effects on both insect physiology and pathogen development7.
These bacteria are best known as active modulators of host
reproduction via the induction of mechanisms that promote their
rapid invasion of insect host populations. The most commonly
observed of these phenotypes is cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI),
which
prevents uninfected
females from
producing
viable
progeny after mating with infected males due to chromosomal
segregation defects in the first cellular divisions of the fertilized
egg (reviewed in ref. 8). However, infected females are able
to produce viable progeny regardless of whether they mate
with infected or uninfected males through unknown rescue
mechanisms, an effect that favours Wolbachia’s spread9,10.
Additional
phenotypes
include
vertical
transmission
from
mother to progeny, and a female bias in the sex ratio through
selective male killing, male feminization and female partheno-
genesis
(where
unfertilized
eggs
develop
as
females)11–13.
Combined with these properties, Wolbachia infections in many
mosquito species can prevent pathogen development and block
disease transmission from vector to human. The list of vector-
borne pathogens affected by Wolbachia is broad and includes
viral pathogens causing dengue, yellow fever, West Nile and
Chikungunya, as well as Plasmodium parasites14–18, suggesting a
general mechanism of pathogen blocking by an upregulated
immune response in the mosquito host19–21, although not in all
cases16,22.
We have recently identified stable Wolbachia infections
in natural populations of two important malaria vectors,
Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles coluzzii, in Burkina Faso23,
a country with a high malaria burden. Owing to several negative
reports24–26, it was previously believed that these bacteria were
unable to infect Anopheles species, as also suggested by the
difficulties to generate stably transinfected Anopheles lines in the
laboratory (only recently surmounted14). Consequently, blocking
of Plasmodium parasites was initially demonstrated using either
transient injections of non-native Wolbachia strains into adult
Anopheles females15,19, or a bird model of malaria infection
transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes16. Our previous study showed
that Wolbachia were transmitted from females to progeny with an
average transmission frequency of 68% (ranging from 56 to
100%) and determined that the strain identified in Anopheles
(which we named wAnga) belongs to a new arthropod-specific
supergroup23. Wolbachia infections have since been confirmed in
a subsequent study of A. coluzzii mosquitoes from the same
region of Burkina Faso27.
As
Wolbachia
can
profoundly
perturb
insect
ecology,
behaviour and physiology, and can significantly reduce transmis-
sion of some human pathogens, our previous findings provide an
unprecedented opportunity to assess the physiological and
reproductive impacts of wAnga infection on anophelines and to
determine how these effects influence the dynamics of malaria
transmission. Here we explore the complex relationships between
Anopheles mosquitoes, Plasmodium parasites and Wolbachia
endosymbionts in natural populations. We find that wAnga
infections are persistent in A. coluzzii over several years, proving
these bacteria are stable residents in these mosquito populations,
and are also detected in another important malaria vector,
Anopheles arabiensis. Although crosses between infected and
uninfected individuals do not show evidence of CI, infected
females lay eggs more rapidly than uninfected individuals.
Sampling of natural populations shows that Wolbachia-positive
females are infected with Plasmodium parasites at significantly
lower frequencies than Wolbachia-negative individuals, unveiling
a negative correlation between these endosymbionts and deadly
malaria parasites. Modelling the effects of these endosymbionts
on malaria transmission dynamics reveals that natural Wolbachia
infections could have a significant impact on the prevalence of
malaria in human populations in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Results
Wolbachia infections are stable and localize in the oocytes. We
returned to Valle
´e du Kou near Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso,
in 2014 to determine the prevalence of Wolbachia infections in
A. coluzzii populations. We collected 602 mosquitoes and iden-
tified infections at a frequency of 46% (275/602). Furthermore,
analysis of samples collected in 2013 in the town of Soumousso
found wAnga at a frequency of 33% (16/49) in A. arabiensis
(Supplementary Table 1), a species not effectively targeted by
LLINs and indoor residual sprays as it primarily blood feeds and
rests outdoors. The prevalence of wAnga was moderate compared
with that observed in naturally infected Aedes and Culex
mosquitoes24,28, although this may be due to difficulties in
detection caused by low intensity of infection in some samples23.
When considering all data since 2011, prevalence was variable
between years (19–46%) (Supplementary Table 1), suggesting
physiological or ecological factors may influence Wolbachia
dynamics over time.
With the aim to facilitate detection of these bacteria within the
female, we established a stable wAnga-infected mosquito line in
our laboratory after colonization of A. coluzzii populations from
the Valle
´e du Kou villages. We dissected ovaries from females and
visualized wAnga at a similar frequency (43%) within the ovarian
follicles by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) experiments
using a DNA probe that specifically hybridizes to Wolbachia 16S
nucleic acid sequences (Fig. 1a). In control experiments, no signal
was detected in ovaries dissected from females treated with
tetracycline to clear wAnga infection (Fig. 1b), nor when using an
excess of unlabelled probe of identical sequence in competition
with the labelled probe (Fig. 1c).
wAnga does not induce CI but affects oviposition. Many
Wolbachia strains induce CI when an infected male mates with
an
uninfected female, producing
mostly inviable
progeny.
To determine whether natural Wolbachia infections induce CI
and/or other reproductive phenotypes in field A. coluzzii, we
collected eggs from blood-fed females in houses or larvae from
breeding sites and, after adult emergence, performed crosses
between virgin males and females using a force-mating technique,
as field mosquitoes of this species do not mate in captivity.
After mating, females were blood-fed and allowed to lay eggs
individually in separate oviposition containers. We measured the
number of eggs developed to assess the impact of infection on
fecundity, and the larval hatch rates to measure effects on fertility
and therefore detect a possible occurrence of CI. We also scored

 the sex ratio of the progeny of each individual female by letting
larvae grow to adulthood and counting males and females to
determine whether wAnga induces sex distortions in these
mosquitoes. Both parents of each brood were genotyped and
screened for Wolbachia post hoc, and crosses between Wolbachia-
positive males and Wolbachia-negative females (that is, those
potentially inducing CI, shown in blue in Fig. 2) were compared
with all other cross combinations (Wolbachia-positive males and
females; Wolbachia-negative males and females; and Wolbachia-
negative males and Wolbachia-positive females). Although egg
inviability was slightly higher in the crosses in which CI is pre-
dicted to occur, we did not observe any significant effect of
wAnga on egg inviability between our crosses, which suggests that
this Wolbachia strain does not cause detectable CI in natural
A. coluzzii populations (Kruskal–Wallis test, w2 ¼ 1.25, degrees of
freedom (d.f.) ¼ 3, P40.05; Fig. 2a). Moreover, we found no
difference in the number of eggs developed (Kruskal–Wallis,
w2 ¼ 4.09, d.f. ¼ 3, P40.05; Fig. 2b), eggs laid (Kruskal–Wallis,
w2 ¼ 0.686, d.f. ¼ 3, P40.05; Supplementary Fig. 1) or in the
progeny sex ratio (Student’s t-test on log10-transformed ratios,
t ¼ 0.257, d.f. ¼ 26, P40.05; Fig. 2c).
We next assessed whether egg-laying behaviour is altered by
wAnga infection. To this end, blood-fed females from houses in
the Valle
´e du Kou were placed in individual cups 2 days post
blood feeding, and oviposition rates were counted daily. After
assessing their infection status post hoc, we determined that
wAnga-infected females had laid eggs significantly more quickly
than uninfected females (on average 0.73±0.11 days, log-rank
test, w2 ¼ 32.36, d.f. ¼ 1, Po0.0001; Fig. 2d). This shortened
oviposition timing could increase the number of gonotrophic
cycles over the course of a female’s lifespan, and suggests
that wAnga-infected females may bite more frequently than
uninfected individuals (Supplementary Fig. 2), with possible
consequences for malaria transmission. However, as predicted by
life history theory29, an increase in fecundity would likely induce
a compensatory decrease in longevity (not measured in our
experimental design), a key component for the completion of the
parasite cycle within the mosquito vector.
wAnga
interferes
with
natural
Plasmodium
infections.
A crucial question concerning Wolbachia infections in Anopheles
mosquitoes
is
whether
these
bacteria
impact
Plasmodium
transmission by the mosquito vector. As Burkina Faso is a region
of high malaria transmission, we reasoned that we could directly
assess the effects of natural wAnga infection on the prevalence of
Plasmodium parasites in blood-fed females collected from the
interior of houses in the Valle
´e du Kou. We dissected a total of
221 blood-fed A. coluzzii females (genotyped post hoc) 5 days post
collection, a time when the blood meal is fully digested and oocyst
development is underway. DNA was extracted from samples
containing abdomens and thoraxes (encompassing the ovaries,
the midgut and the salivary glands) dissected from individual
females to unravel a possible interaction between the presence of
Wolbachia and Plasmodium in these individuals. A total of 116
females were positive for wAnga, with an infection prevalence of
52.5% (116/221). Plasmodium infections were detected in 12
females, producing a prevalence of 5.4% (12/221), comparable to
previously reported data for this region30. We found a strong bias
for Plasmodium infection in Wolbachia-negative individuals;
11 Plasmodium-positive females were negative for Wolbachia,
and only 1 female showed co-infection with bacteria and parasites
(Fisher’s exact post hoc test on unnormalized data, two-tailed,
P ¼ 0.0018; Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 2). This highly
significant reduction—over 90%—suggests that wAnga may
interfere with Plasmodium development in the mosquito vector,
as shown in artificial Anopheles–Wolbachia combinations14,15,19.
We went on to model whether natural Wolbachia infections
would affect malaria transmission dynamics when these results,
obtained on a limited sampling of a single transmission area,
are extrapolated on a broader scale. We used a modified
Ross–Macdonald
model
with
additional
compartments
for
Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes, which differ in their suscept-
ibility to malaria (Fig. 3a) and in the length of their gonotrophic
cycle (Fig. 2d), an effect that would likely impact their biting rates
(Supplementary Fig. 2). We considered the Wolbachia-infected
populations to have an identical mortality rate to uninfected
mosquitoes (Fig. 3b, red line) but also ran a model where the
increased speed of the gonotrophic cycle is paralleled by a
decrease in female lifespan (Fig. 3b, blue line), as predicted by life
history theory. Our model suggests that in both scenarios,
infection with these bacteria might decrease malaria prevalence in
humans, even within the range of Wolbachia frequencies that we
observed in mosquito populations.
Discussion
Our findings that natural Wolbachia infections persist in
Anopheles mosquito populations and are negatively correlated
to Plasmodium parasite development bring into sharp focus the
potential impact of these bacteria on malaria transmission.
Although our study is limited to samples from the VK5 village
and we have not yet determined the effects of wAnga on malaria
transmission by other important vectors like A. gambiae and
A.
arabiensis,
the
observed
negative
correlation
between
Plasmodium and Wolbachia prevalence in A. coluzzii suggests
that malaria dynamics may be affected by the stable presence of
these endosymbionts. Indeed, provided our results are confirmed
when additional females, species and geographical locations
are tested, our mathematical model predicts that increasing

 Wolbachia prevalence would reduce malaria infections in the
human population, even when incorporating an increase in biting
rates and regardless of a possible trade-off in lifespan. How can
wAnga infections have such a significant impact on Plasmodium
transmission? A number of studies have shown that strong anti-
pathogenic effects likely caused by immune system activation are
often associated with novel Wolbachia transinfections14–16,19.
Consistent with the previously determined imperfect maternal
transmission rates23 and the lack of CI detected in this study, the
observed interference with Plasmodium suggests that wAnga
represents a recently introduced infection not yet fully adapted to
the Anopheles host. Although we did not characterize localization
of these bacteria in tissues besides the ovaries, we previously
detected wAnga in A. coluzzii carcasses that excluded germline
tissues23. These results suggest wAnga also infects somatic tissues,
including those where Plasmodium development occurs, possibly
inducing parasite killing via the upregulation of the mosquito
immune system.
As hypothesized in other Wolbachia infections16,31–33, wAnga
may also effectively compete with Plasmodium for nutrient
resources. Following blood feeding, large amounts of lipid
transporters circulate to transfer lipids from the gut and the fat
body to the ovary. These same lipid transporters are required
by Plasmodium to evade the mosquito immune system34,35.
Wolbachia’s potential diversion of resources may allow increased
rates
of
immune
system-mediated
killing
of
Plasmodium.
Alternatively, these endosymbionts may compete with other
bacteria in the microbiome, especially following a blood meal36,
further draining resources away from developing Plasmodium
parasites. Regardless of the mechanism, in future studies it will be
crucial to test Wolbachia–Plasmodium interactions in different
geographical locations and across different transmission seasons
to determine the possible heterogeneity in pathogen-blocking
effects across Sub-Saharan Africa, a factor that would have
consequences for the interpretation of the outcome of key malaria
control strategies such as LLINs and indoor residual sprays3.
We found that wAnga infections cause limited reproductive
phenotypes
in
the
A.
coluzzii
host,
and
in
our
mating
assays we did not detect CI at significant levels. Although
observed in multiple Wolbachia-infected arthropods, CI is
not a universal phenomenon, and its presence and penetrance
is highly dependent on Wolbachia strain and host organism

Figure 2 | Analysis of reproductive phenotypes induced by wAnga. (a–c) A. coluzzii females and males collected as eggs or larvae from Valle
´e du Kou
were bred to adulthood and forced mated, and after blood feeding the reproductive output of females was individually scored. wAnga-infected (green) and -
uninfected (grey) females (right) and males (left) were identified by 16S nested PCR post hoc, and mating couples were divided into four groups (wAnga-
negative couples, dark grey; wAnga-positive couples, purple; wAnga-positive females mated to wAnga-negative males, red; and wAnga-negative females
mated to wAnga-positive males, blue). (a) Egg inviability was calculated by dividing the number of infertile and unhatched eggs in each brood by the total
number of eggs 4 days after egg laying. CI, which would manifest as higher inviability in the cross between wAnga-negative females and wAnga-positive
males, was not observed (Kruskal–Wallis test, w2 ¼ 1.25, d.f. ¼ 3, P40.05). (b) The total number of eggs produced by each female was determined by
adding the number of eggs laid to the number of eggs remaining in the ovaries at the time of dissection (Kruskal–Wallis, w2 ¼ 4.09, d.f. ¼ 3, P40.05).
(c) Hatched larvae from each brood in a were raised to adulthood and sex was scored. The sex ratio of each brood was calculated as the number of female
progeny divided by the total progeny (Student’s t-test on log10-transformed ratios, t ¼ 0.257, d.f. ¼ 26, P40.05). (d) A total of 221 blood-fed females were
collected from the walls of houses in Valle
´e du Kou, and 2 days after collection placed in individual oviposition containers to record the timing of egg-laying.
The cumulative proportion of females that laid (n ¼ 143) on each of 3 consecutive nights following access to an oviposition site is plotted. wAnga-infected
females (green line) laid eggs more quickly than uninfected females (grey line) (log-rank test, w2 ¼ 32.36, d.f. ¼ 1, Po0.0001). In a and b, horizontal lines
represent the medians. In c, vertical lines and error bars represent the geometric mean and the 95% confidence intervals, respectively. Numbers in

 (reviewed in ref. 37). It remains to be established whether CI
could be triggered by wAnga infection in species that do not
naturally harbour these endosymbionts, as this would be an
important first step towards integrating the use of wAnga into
malaria control strategies. A host-dependent ability of Wolbachia
to induce CI in non-natural hosts37 has been demonstrated
in many insects including the major dengue vector Aedes aegypti,
in which the fruit fly wMel strain induces strong CI38 and
has successfully invaded natural populations39. Furthermore,
Wolbachia densities, CI and other reproductive phenotypes can
also be modulated within the same host by physiological,
ecological and environmental factors including the age of the
insect40, temperature41 and larval density42.
Although wAnga did not increase the number of eggs laid by
infected females, it increased the rate at which these eggs were
laid.
Over
multiple
gonotrophic
cycles,
this
reproductive
phenotype could increase lifetime female fecundity, although life
history theory predicts that this effect would be counteracted by a
trade-off with longevity29. The mechanism of this effect may
relate to more efficient blood meal digestion, lipid deposition
within the egg, egg maturation, activation of hormonal pathways
that trigger oviposition43 or a combination of these factors.
Furthermore, in conditions of nutrient deprivation, wAnga could
be provisioning blood-fed females with additional nutrients
as shown in other Wolbachia infection models44–46, ensuring
timely oviposition. These hypotheses remain to be tested, and
the colonized Wolbachia-infected A. coluzzii line may prove
instrumental to determining the full extent of reproductive
manipulations that wAnga inflicts on its mosquito host.
Combined with the previously reported identification in
A. gambiae in the same region, the finding of wAnga infections
in natural populations of A. arabiensis, a vector species capable of
remarkable plasticity in its blood feeding and resting behaviour,
suggests that this natural Wolbachia strain is capable of adapting
to different anophelines. wAnga therefore provides a promising
new tool for future malaria control strategies aimed at exophilic
and exophagic Anopheles species not targeted by current vector
control strategies.
Methods
Mosquito collections. Two Anopheles species were collected from two separate
field sites near Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. A. coluzzii were collected from the
VK5 village (11� 230 N; 4� 240 W) in the Valle
´e du Kou, located 30 km northwest of
Bobo-Dioulasso. Mosquitoes were collected in two ways: (1) blood-fed adult
females were captured in houses in the village; and (2) fourth instar larvae were
collected from breeding sites in the rice fields surrounding the village and bred to
adulthood in an insectary. A. arabiensis were collected from houses in the village of
Soumousso (11� 000 N; 4� 020 W) located 55 km northeast of Bobo-Dioulasso as
blood-fed adult females.
Establishment of a wAnga-infected A. coluzzii colony. wAnga-infected
A. coluzzii mosquitoes were colonized by breeding eggs collected from VK5 to
adulthood in an insectary. Adult females emerging from these eggs were crossed to
A. coluzzii males from the Mopti colony originating from Mali (obtained through
BEI Resources, NIAID, NIH: A. gambiae, Strain MOPTI, MRA-763, contributed by
Gregory C. Lanzaro) over two generations. At each generation, after egg laying,
infection in these hybrids was determined via PCR on Wolbachia 16S rDNA
(see section ‘wAnga detection by PCR and sequencing’), and the progeny of
wAnga-infected mothers was pooled to establish the line. A line with the same
genetic background but cleared of wAnga infection was established by treating a
subset of the F3 generation with tetracycline during larval development
(1 mg ml � 1) and adulthood (10 mg ml � 1).
DNA extraction and mosquito species genotyping. Mosquitoes were beheaded
and the genomic DNA of carcasses was extracted using the Qiagen Blood and
Tissue kit (Qiagen) with an extended lysis incubation step. In brief, carcasses were
homogenized in 1 � phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated with the kit’s
proteinase K and AL lysis buffer for 30 min at 56 �C. The remaining extraction
steps were performed following the kit’s supplementary protocol for DNA
extraction of insect cells. For A. coluzzii, A. gambiae and A. arabiensis genotyping,
the S200 X6.1 locus from genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using standard
protocols and with the following primers: forward 50-TCGCCTTAGACCTTGCG
TTA-30, reverse 50-CGCTTCAAGAATTCGAGATAC-30 (ref. 47).
wAnga detection by PCR and sequencing. Detection of wAnga infection in
mosquito carcasses was performed by PCR amplification of the 16S rDNA region
using Wolbachia-specific primers (W-Specf: 50-CATACCTATTCGAAGGGA
TAG-30, W-Specr: 50-AGCTTCGAGTGAAACCAATTC-30) and standard
protocols48. In cases of low infection intensity, nested PCR was used for wAnga
detection. A total of 2 ml of the amplification product from the initial 16S rDNA
PCR was amplified using specific internal primers (16SNF: 50-GAAGGGATAGG
GTCGGTTCG-30; 16SNR: 50-CAATTCCCATGGCGTGACG-30) and HotStarTaq
(Qiagen) in a 20 ml reaction volume. The nested 16S rDNA PCR cycling conditions
used were 15 min at 95 �C, followed by 35 cycles of 15 s at 95 �C, 25 s at 66 �C and

model incorporating Wolbachia-infected mosquito compartments was used to determine the impact of Wolbachia on malaria prevalence. In addition to
variation in biting rate and susceptibility to malaria, Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes were either considered to have an identical daily mortality rate to
uninfected mosquitoes (red line) or an enhanced daily mortality rate due to trade-offs with increased gonotrophic cycles (blue line). The shaded area
represents the range in Wolbachia prevalence detected in our studies across multiple years.

TTAAA-30, Integrated DNA Technologies). The ovaries of wAnga-infected and
tetracycline-treated females from the established wAnga colony were dissected in
1 � PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, and treated with 80% ethanol–6%
hydrogen peroxide to remove autofluorescence. FISH was then conducted using a
protocol modified from Toomey et al.49. Following initial pre-hybridization
equilibration steps, hybridization was conducted by incubating tissues with
1 ng ml � 1 of the RNA probe in hybridization solution containing 50% formamide,
5 � SSC, 250 mg ml � 1 salmon sperm DNA, 0.5 � Denhardt’s solution, 20 mM
Tris-HCl and 0.1% Tween at 37 �C for 3 h. Probe competition hybridization was
conducted by incubating tissues with a mixture of the labelled RNA probe
(1 ng ml � 1) and an unlabelled probe of identical sequence (20 ng ml � 1). Following
washes in a solution containing 1 � SSC, 0.1% Tween and 20 mM Tris-HCl then in
a solution with 0.5 � SSC, 0.1% Tween and 20 mM Tris-HCl at 55 �C, tissues were
blocked in 1% BSA in 1 � PBS-0.1% Tween (PBST) and stained with 1:100 mouse
anti-Cy3 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Tissues were then incubated in
1:1,000 goat anti-mouse Alexa488 antibody (ThermoFisher Scientific) and in
1 mg ml � 1 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma-Aldrich). All staining steps were
followed by washes in PBST. Tissues were then mounted in Vectashield mounting
media and images were acquired on a Zeiss Axio Observer inverted fluorescent
microscope with Apotome2. Post-imaging processing was done using ImageJ and
Adobe Photoshop CS5.
Analysis of reproductive phenotypes. For CI, fecundity and sex-ratio analyses,
mosquitoes were collected as fourth instar larvae from breeding sites or as eggs
deposited by blood-fed females collected from houses in VK5 in the Valle
´e du Kou.
These field-collected larvae and eggs were bred to adulthood in the insectary,
and adult males and females were crossed in single pairings by forced mating
(protocol available on https://www.beiresources.org/Publications/MethodsinAno-
phelesResearch.aspx). DNA from males was immediately extracted and wAnga
infection status was determined by 16S PCR. Females were blood-fed and placed
into individual cups to allow them to oviposit individually. Following oviposition,
the genomic DNA of these females was extracted and screened for wAnga infection
by 16S PCR. Egg broods were scored for inviability (a direct indicator of CI) and
the number of eggs laid (fecundity). Females were also dissected to determine the
number of eggs retained and consequently the total number of eggs developed.
To assess the sex ratio of the progeny, broods from these crosses were bred to
adulthood and the number of males and females in each brood was determined.
Infection status of males and females in each cross was determined post hoc by
16S PCR.
For timing of oviposition, blood-fed females were collected from houses in VK5
and put into cups 2 days post blood feeding to allow them to oviposit individually.
Oviposition time was monitored by checking for the presence of eggs in each cup
every day following provision of an oviposition site.
Plasmodium detection by quantitative PCR. The quantitative PCR protocol
published by Bass et al.50 for Plasmodium detection was modified for use with
SYBR green dye. Genomic DNA extracted from female carcasses was 10-fold
diluted, and 5 ml of this dilution was quantified in a mix with 1 � Fast SYBR Green
Master Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific) and 300 nM of each primer targeting a
region in the Plasmodium 18S rDNA sequence (PlasF: 50-CTTAGTTACGATTA
ATAGGAGTAGC-30; PlasR: 50-GAAAATCTAAGAATTTCACCTCTGA-30) in
duplicate reactions on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). Relative quantities were calculated using a standard curve built with
serial dilutions of a plasmid containing the targeted 18S rDNA sequence. This
plasmid was made by PCR amplifying the 18S rDNA region of genomic DNA
extracted from the P. falciparum P2G12 strain with the PlasF and PlasR primers,
and cloning the resulting product using the pGEM-T Vector System (Promega).
Copy number quantification was determined using a Nanodrop 2000c
Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific).
Model of feeding time. Individual female mosquitoes were simulated stochasti-
cally through the course of their adult life. On emerging as adults, all female
mosquitoes rested for 1 night before mating. The following night females took their
initial blood meal, beginning gonotrophic cycles, which consisted of feeding,
resting for up to 3 nights and egg laying. The number of nights spent resting before
egg laying by each female in each gonotrophic cycle was determined probabil-
istically from the data on oviposition (Fig. 2d). This process was simulated in
MATLAB R2015a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) for one million
mosquitoes to determine what proportion of mosquitoes fed each night.
Malaria transmission model. The Ross–Macdonald compartmental model of
malaria transmission51,52 was adapted to include Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes,
forming a system of five delay differential equations. The infected human
population (IH) grew when susceptible humans received infectious bites and
declined as humans recovered at a fixed rate (r ¼ 0.05)51. Mosquito populations
(EM and EW) became infected after an infectious bite but were not infectious
(IM and IW) until the completion of the latent period, with Wolbachia-infected
populations denoted with a W-subscript. The fraction of the mosquito population
infected with Wolbachia (W) was constant throughout a single simulation.

The Wolbachia-infected and -uninfected mosquitoes differed only in biting rate
(a ¼ 0.5 and a
ˆ ¼ 0.565), susceptibility to malaria infection (c ¼ 0.79 and c
ˆ ¼ 0.07)
and daily mortality rate (u ¼ 0.15, red line53–55; and u
ˆ ¼ 0.175, blue line in Fig. 3b).
The probability of transition to humans (b ¼ 0.4)51, the length of the latent period
(t ¼ 12)56 and the relative mosquito to human ratio (m ¼ 7.7)51 were identical
between both mosquito populations. Hats denote parameters associated with
Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes. The biting rate (a
ˆ) was enhanced by the relative
number of blood feeds possible by Wolbachia-infected females compared with
Wolbachia-uninfected females as determined in our feeding model, a
ˆ ¼ 1.13a
(Supplementary Fig. 2). The susceptibility of Wolbachia-infected females to malaria
infection (c
ˆ) was discounted based on the data presented in Fig. 3a, c
ˆ ¼ c/11.
The mortality rate (u
ˆ) was increased (Fig. 3b, blue line) to impose a fitness costs on
Wolbachia-infected females, such that the average number of feeds was identical
for Wolbachia-infected and uninfected mosquitoes. All simulations were
performed in MATLAB R2015a (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA)
using the dde23 solver.
