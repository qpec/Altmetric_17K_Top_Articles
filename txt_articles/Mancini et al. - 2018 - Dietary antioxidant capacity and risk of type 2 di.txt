Abstract
Aims/hypothesis Recent evidence suggests that oxidative
stress may contribute to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.
The diet, and especially fruit and vegetables, contains a variety
of compounds with antioxidant activity, which may have
cumulative/synergistic antioxidant effects. The total antioxi-
dant capacity, an index derived from dietary intake, is a single
estimate of antioxidant capacity from all dietary antioxidants.
The main aim of this study was to investigate the relationship
between total antioxidant capacity and risk of type 2 diabetes.
Methods Among 64,223 women (mean age 52 ± 7 years)
from the French E3N-European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, 1751 women had vali-
dated type 2 diabetes during 15 years of follow-up. The total
antioxidant capacity was estimated with the ferric ion-
reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method. Adjusted Cox
proportional hazards regression models were used to calculate
HRs and 95% CIs for the associations between total
antioxidant capacity and type 2 diabetes risk, adjusted for
potential confounders.
Results In multivariable models, higher levels of total antiox-
idant capacity were associated with a lower risk of type 2
diabetes. Compared with women in the lowest quintile, wom-
en in the third, fourth and fifth quintiles for total antioxidant
capacity had HRs of 0.74 (95% CI 0.63, 0.86), 0.70 (95% CI
0.59, 0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.60, 0.89), respectively. The
inverse association between total antioxidant capacity and risk
of type 2 diabetes was linear up to values of 15 mmol/day,
after which the effect reached a plateau.
Conclusions/interpretation Our findings suggest that the total
antioxidant capacity may play an important role in reducing
the risk of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged women. More stud-
ies are warranted to better understand the biological mecha-
nisms underlying this inverse association.

 physical inactivity and an energy-dense diet [2]. Increasing
evidence from both experimental and clinical studies suggests
that oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of
type 2 diabetes: abnormally high levels of free radicals and the
simultaneous decline of antioxidant defence mechanisms can
lead to damage of cellular organelles and enzymes, increased
lipid peroxidation and development of insulin resistance
[3–5]. Moreover, previous studies have highlighted how in-
creased intake of common dietary antioxidants such as vita-
min E and vitamin C increase insulin sensitivity, reduce
fasting and post-meal blood glucose and improve HbA1c
levels [6, 7]. Other authors have reported a statistically signif-
icant decrease in total antioxidant status and increase in levels
of oxidative stress markers in individuals with type 2 diabetes
compared with healthy individuals, and have suggested that
these levels could be considered markers of early disease and
predictors of type 2 diabetes complications [8].
Dietary compounds with antioxidant activity may have
cumulative/synergistic antioxidant effects. The main known
contributors to the overall antioxidant capacity of the diet are
fruit and vegetables, wine, coffee and tea [9]. Antioxidants
from the diet act in two main ways: first, preventing the gen-
eration of excess free radicals, and thus avoiding oxidative
damage to the cell; and second, after damage has occurred,
preventing further cell degeneration, thus alleviating the pro-
gression of conditions caused by oxidative stress [10].
Recently, an index of the total antioxidant capacity of foods,
which describes the ability of food antioxidants to scavenge
preformed free radicals, has been suggested as a tool for in-
vestigating the health effects of antioxidants present in mixed
diets. The total antioxidant capacity concept aims to group the
capacities from all dietary antioxidants into a single estimate
[11]. A high total antioxidant capacity has been related to
several health benefits in cohort, cross-sectional and interven-
tional studies [12–17]. These findings support total antioxi-
dant capacity as a promising functional descriptor of the pro-
tective effects of dietary antioxidants in different populations.
To date, no study has investigated the association between
total antioxidant capacity and risk of type 2 diabetes.
The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation-
ship between total antioxidant capacity and risk of type 2
diabetes in the E3N-European Prospective Investigation into
Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) cohort, a large cohort of French
women.
Methods
The E3N-EPIC study The E3N-EPIC prospective cohort
was initiated in France in 1990 to study the main risk factors
for cancer and severe chronic conditions in women [18, 19]. It
is the French constituent of the large EPIC study, and the EPIC
sub-study devoted to diabetes: Interaction of Genetic and
Lifestyle Factors on the Incidence of Type 2 Diabetes
(InterAct) [20]. The E3N-EPIC cohort includes 98,995
French women born between 1925 and 1950, insured by the
Mutuelle Générale de l’Education Nationale (MGEN), a na-
tional teachers’ health insurance plan. All women gave written
informed consent and approval was obtained from the
Commission National Informatique et Libertés (French
National Commission for Data Protection and Individual
Freedom).
Population for analysis Among the 74,522 women with di-
etary information available, women were excluded if they did
not complete any questionnaire after the dietary questionnaire
(n = 936). Women were also excluded if they had extreme
values for the ratio of energy intake to required energy (i.e.
they were in the first and 99th percentiles of the distribution in
the population) (n = 1466). Basal metabolic rate (BMR),
based on age, sex and weight (self-reported in kg), multiplied
by 1.55 was used to estimate a woman’s energy intake.
Finally, women with pre-existing cardiovascular disease
(n = 476), pre-existing diabetes (n = 1150) or pre-existing
cancer (n = 4129) were excluded from the present study.
Women with potential pre-existing, but not validated, diabetes
(2142) were also excluded. Thus, this analysis included
64,223 women, of whom 1751 had validated type 2 diabetes
diagnosed during follow-up (June 1993–December 2008).
Ascertainment of type 2 diabetes Women who potentially
had diabetes were identified from two sources. First, self-
reporting of diabetes, diabetes diet, diabetes drugs or
hospitalisation for diabetes in follow-up questionnaires.
Second, through the insurance drug reimbursement database:
all women reimbursed for glucose-lowering medications at
least once after January 2004 were considered as potentially
having diabetes.
All women who potentially had diabetes were contacted
and asked to answer a diabetes-specific questionnaire that in-
cluded questions on the circumstances of diagnosis (year of
diagnosis, symptoms, medical examination, fasting or random
glucose concentrations at diagnosis), actual diabetes therapy
(prescription of diet or physical activity, list of glucose-
lowering drugs taken) and most recent fasting glucose and
HbA1c levels.
Women were identified for validation if they had one of: (1)
fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l; random glucose
≥11.1 mmol/l at diagnosis; (2) report of glucose-lowering
medication use; or (3) most recent fasting glucose or HbA1c
concentration ≥7.0 mmol/l or ≥7%, respectively. For valida-
tion, results were cross-checked against at least two of: self-
reported diabetes in the follow-up questionnaires; ascertained
diabetes in the diabetes-specific questionnaire; or drug reim-
bursed by insurance. Women reimbursed at least twice for
glucose-lowering medications were validated as having

 diabetes even when they did not answer the diabetes-specific
questionnaire.
For administrative and logistic reasons, diabetes incident
after 2008 has not yet been validated according to the algo-
rithm used for diabetes before 2008. Women with diabetes
occurring after 2008 have been identified exclusively from
reimbursement for glucose-lowering medications and not
from self-declaration, and they have not completed the
diabetes-specific questionnaire. The principal analysis de-
scribed here includes only women with diabetes that occurred
before 2008.
Dietary questionnaire In June 1993, a validated 208 item
dietary questionnaire was sent to participants to assess the
habitual diet of the previous year. Food and drink consump-
tion throughout the day took French meal patterns into ac-
count, with questions for each meal occasion, snacks and
aperitifs. The validity and reproducibility of the questionnaire
have been previously described [21].
Mean daily nutrient intake was evaluated using a food
composition table derived from the French food composition
table of the French Information Center on Food Quality [22].
Since the food composition table did not include the antioxi-
dant capacity of foods, the antioxidant capacity was assigned
to each food item based on a previously published database
[23]. Within this database the antioxidant capacity was esti-
mated using two assays: the ferric ion-reducing antioxidant
power (FRAP), based on the single-electron transfer method
[24]; and the total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter
(TRAP), based on the hydrogen atom transfer method.
Because the correlation between FRAP and TRAP was high
(Pearson r = 0.999), only results obtained with the FRAP
index are presented. Two values were available for four food
items (apple, melon, beer and vinegar), so we used the average
value. There was no exact match in the database for the fol-
lowing six foods, thus we used the value of a similar item,
based on similarities between botanical groups and in vitamin
E and C and polyphenol content: mirabelle plum (matched
with loquat), lychee (matched with loquat), mango (matched
with persimmon), watercress (matched with spinach), lemon
(matched with lemon juice) and alcohol-free beer (matched
with beer).
The total antioxidant capacity of the diet was calculated
excluding the contribution of coffee. The Maillard prod-
ucts of the coffee-roasting process are the main contribu-
tors to the in vitro antioxidant capacity of coffee. However,
their high molecular weight means the proportion absorbed
through the intestinal mucosa remains unclear, and their
role in cellular antioxidant defence is questioned [25, 26].
Furthermore, because coffee is rich in antioxidants, it
would drive the association in the FRAP calculation and
obscure any associations between other sources of FRAP
and type 2 diabetes.
Statistical analysis Missing values were <5% for all variables
and were imputed from the median value. HR estimates and
95% CI values were obtained using Cox proportional hazards
models, with age as the time scale. The time at entry was age
at the start of follow-up and the exit time was the age when
participants were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, died, were
lost to follow-up or were censored at the end of the follow-up
period, whichever occurred first.
The main exposure variable was the total antioxidant ca-
pacity, measured by the FRAP index and calculated excluding
the contribution from coffee. The FRAP index was
categorised by quintile, and the lowest quintile group was
used as the reference category in the models. We first per-
formed a univariate analysis (Model 1), and then adjusted
for smoking status (never vs ever smoker), physical activity
(metabolic equivalents [MET]-h/week, as a continuous vari-
able), education level (fewer or more than 14 years of educa-
tion), hypertension (self-reported or use of blood pressure-
lowering drugs: yes vs no), hypercholesterolaemia (self-re-
ported blood cholesterol >6.2 mmol/l or use of cholesterol-
lowering drugs: yes vs no), family history of diabetes (yes vs
no) (Model 2). Finally, Model 3 was as Model 2 but further
adjusted for diet-related variables, which included energy in-
take (kJ/day) and alcohol intake (g ethanol/day). The model
was corrected for adherence scores to the healthy dietary pat-
tern and the western dietary pattern, both derived with princi-
pal components analysis (PCA), as previously described [27].
We further adjusted Model 3 for BMI (kg/m2). All covariates
used for adjustment in the models were collected by a ques-
tionnaire attached to the 1993 dietary questionnaire. Only the
‘family history of diabetes’ variable was collected later, in
2005.
Spline regression was used to better characterise the shape
of the association between total antioxidant capacity and type
2 diabetes risk. The reference value for estimating HRs and
95% CI was chosen as the FRAP minimum value (1.03 mmol/
day) and four knots were used (the 20th, 40th, 60th and 80th
percentiles of the distribution).
Finally, we tested the interaction between FRAP and the
main potential confounders: total energy intake, coffee con-
sumption, fruit and vegetable consumption, alcohol intake,
score of adherence to a western dietary pattern and to a healthy
dietary pattern (all divided in two categories according to the
median value), smoking status and BMI (< vs ≥25 kg/m2), and
if the interaction test was statistically significant, we per-
formed stratified analyses.
All statistical tests were two-sided and considered statisti-
cally significant if p < 0.05. Data were analysed with the
Statistical Analysis Systems software package, version 9.4
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Sensitivity analyses To evaluate associations with the overall
total antioxidant capacity, we ran the models with the FRAP
310

 score including coffee, as a sensitivity analysis. We also eval-
uated the associations between the total antioxidant capacity
and type 2 diabetes excluding women with diabetes that oc-
curred in the first 5 years of follow-up, to investigate potential
reverse causation bias. Finally, we included in the analysis all
women who developed diabetes after 2008, identified exclu-
sively from the drug reimbursement database. In total, an ad-
ditional 503 women were reimbursed at least twice between
2008 and 2012.
Results
Study population characteristics Compared with women in
the lowest quintile group of total antioxidant capacity, those in
the highest quintile group had a higher energy intake, con-
sumed less coffee, more fruit and vegetables, and drank more
tea and wine (Table 1). Moreover, women in the highest quin-
tile group of total antioxidant capacity were more frequently
smokers and were more likely to have more years of
education.
The food groups that contributed the most to the total anti-
oxidant capacity were fruit (23%), vegetables (19%), alcohol-
ic beverages (15%) and hot beverages such as tea, chicory and
hot chocolate (12%).
Total antioxidant capacity and type 2 diabetes risk Higher
levels of total antioxidant capacity were associated with lower
risk of type 2 diabetes (Table 2). In particular, Model 3
highlighted that, in comparison with women in the lowest
quintile group, women in the second, third, fourth and fifth
quintile groups of total antioxidant capacity had HRs of 0.85
(95% CI 0.74, 1.00), 0.70 (95% CI 0.60, 0.73), 0.62 (95% CI
0.52, 0.73) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.50, 0.74), respectively
(Table 2). The magnitude of this association decreased, but
remained statistically significant, when further adjusted for
BMI: 0.89 (95% CI 0.76, 1.03), 0.74 (95% CI 0.63, 0.86),
0.70 (95% CI 0.59, 0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.60, 0.89), re-
spectively for the third, fourth and fifth quintile groups of the
dietary total antioxidant capacity (Table 2).
All tests for interaction were not statistically significant,
withtheexceptionofcoffee(testforinteractionpvalue=0.02).
When stratifying the models on coffee consumption, the in-
verse association between total antioxidant capacity and type
2 diabetes was stronger for women with coffee consumption
below the median consumption (247 ml/day) (Table 3). When
additionally adjusted for BMI, the association between total
antioxidant capacity and type 2 diabetes was observed only in
women with a lower coffee consumption (Table 3).
Using spline regression curves, there was a negative asso-
ciation between total antioxidant capacity and type 2 diabetes
risk. More specifically, the inverse association between total
antioxidant capacity and risk of type 2 diabetes was linear up
to values of FRAP at around 15 mmol/day, after which a
plateau effect was reached (Fig. 1).
Sensitivity analyses When coffee was included in the total
antioxidant capacity index, as measured by FRAP, the associ-
ation between total antioxidant capacity and risk of develop-
ing type 2 diabetes was still statistically significant, although
less strongly so. Indeed, HRs of 0.83 (95% CI 0.71, 0.97),
0.83 (95% CI 0.71, 0.97) and 0.76 (95% CI 0.65, 0.89) were
found for the third, fourth and fifth quintiles, respectively,
compared with the first.
When excluding women with diabetes that occurred during
the first 5 years of follow-up (365 women), the results obtain-
ed were equivalent to those of the main analyses in terms of
magnitude and statistical significance (data not shown).
Finally, the results obtained when including the women
with diabetes that occurred after 2008 and identified exclu-
sively from the drug reimbursement database (503 women)
did not differ from the main results (see electronic supplemen-
tary material [ESM] Table 1).
Discussion
In this cohort of French middle-aged women, higher total
antioxidant capacity of the diet, measured excluding the con-
tribution of coffee, was associated with a lower risk of type 2
diabetes. To our knowledge, this is the first prospective study
to evaluate the risk of type 2 diabetes associated with total
antioxidant capacity of the diet.
Previous studies have reported that the total antioxidant
capacity is inversely associated with risk of the metabolic
syndrome, abdominal obesity and hypertension in adults
[28]. Similarly, in healthy young men and women, a linear
inverse association between total antioxidant capacity with
glucose and lipid biomarkers, as well as with central adiposity
measurements, was highlighted [29].
Montonen et al [30] found a significant association be-
tween vitamin E intake, α-tocopherol, γ-tocopherol, δ-
tocopherol and β-tocotrienol with reduced risk of type 2 dia-
betes, supporting the hypothesis that intake of antioxidants
from the diet reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes. However,
other compounds with antioxidant activity, such as vitamin C,
flavonoids and lycopene, were found to have no impact on
risk of diabetes when considered individually [30–34].
In our population study, women with higher levels of total
antioxidant capacity (measured excluding the contribution of
coffee), were characterised by a high consumption of fruit and
vegetables and tea, which are known to be rich in antioxidant
compounds, and have previously been associated with re-
duced risk of type 2 diabetes [3, 35, 36]. Our findings
strengthen the hypothesis, already suggested by others [31],
that the inverse association between type 2 diabetes and fruit
Diabetologia (2018) 61:308–316
311
 and vegetable consumption, as well as between type 2 diabe-
tes and tea, may be mediated by the synergistic effect of the
antioxidant compounds present in these food items.
Women with higher levels of total antioxidant capacity also
reported higher wine consumption. Consumption of high
quantities of alcoholic beverages is known to be associated
with a higher risk of diabetes, while moderate alcohol con-
sumption is associated with a decreased risk compared with
no consumption [37]. Moreover, only wine has been associ-
ated with a reduced risk of diabetes, with no association

 reported for beer or spirits [38, 39]. When the overall alcohol
intake is moderate, the health benefits related to the abundant
content of phenolic acids and polyphenols, present mainly in
wine, with antioxidant activity prevail over the deleterious
effect of the alcohol itself [40, 41].
Previous studies, including the E3N-EPIC study, have re-
ported an inverse association between coffee consumption and
risk of type 2 diabetes [42, 43]. In our study, we did not
include coffee in the calculation of total antioxidant capacity
because there is no consensus on whether the antioxidants
present in coffee are actually absorbed, and because coffee
has such a high antioxidant content that it would drive the
association with type 2 diabetes. Finally, because coffee con-
sumption is often related to unhealthy behaviours, such as a
stressful life, tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking, there
could be some residual confounding. Our results confirm this
hypothesis: when performing stratified analyses according to
coffee consumption, the association between FRAP and type
2 diabetes disappeared in the group with high coffee con-
sumption, suggesting that coffee consumption mediates the
association with type 2 diabetes in this group. Similarly, when
considering coffee in the FRAP calculation in sensitivity anal-
yses, the inverse association with type 2 diabetes was still
present but weakened. Indeed, the results obtained with the
sensitivity analysis more likely reflected the association be-
tween type 2 diabetes and coffee, rather than with the overall
total antioxidant capacity of the diet.
The spline regression curve shows how the inverse associ-
ation between total antioxidant capacity and risk of type 2
diabetes reaches a plateau for values of FRAP above
15 mmol/day. In a previous study, Cao et al reported a linear
correlation between fasting plasma oxygen radical absorbance
capacity and daily intake of total antioxidants, but when daily
intake of total antioxidants was over 3.0 mmol, the fasting
plasma oxygen radical absorbance capacity reached a plateau
[44]. Indeed, in our study, a constant HR for FRAP values

 above 15 mmol/day is in agreement with the findings of Cao
et al, and it could therefore reflect, as suggested, saturation of
the organism’s capacity to absorb antioxidants from the diet.
Undoubtedly, further studies are needed to clarify the under-
lying biological mechanism.
Strengths and limitations Potential limitations of the present
study should be considered. The dietary estimates are based
on a single questionnaire at baseline, thus misclassification of
exposure is possible. However, as the study is prospective,
any effects are likely to be non-differential and lead to an
attenuation of the true association. Our study population in-
cluded only women. This limitation should be minor, as few
studies have reported differences in type 2 diabetes risk factors
between men and women, although biological mechanisms
may differ between sexes.
The E3N-EPIC cohort, as is the case for most general pop-
ulation cohorts, is not representative of the general population
as it has a low proportion of socially deprived people and
comprises, rather, health-conscious women. Therefore, the
prevalence of overweight and obesity is lower compared with
the general population, which probably explains the lower
prevalence of diabetes. This reduces the potential value of
extending the results to the general population in terms of
attributable fraction of risk, but should not reduce the internal
validity of the findings.
The algorithm used in the E3N-EPIC cohort to validate
type 2 diabetes could be used for women only until 2008.
Although this might represent a limitation, we are confident
that the impact on the results is negligible due to the fact that
the main analysis is based on 18 years of follow-up and has
sufficient statistical power (n = 1751 women). Our confidence
is strengthened by the fact that the results did not change when
we included women with diabetes that occurred after 2008,
identified exclusively from the drug reimbursement database.
The strengths of this study include the large sample size
and the prospective design of the E3N-EPIC cohort, which
allowed us to perform sensitivity analyses while keeping suf-
ficient statistical power to detect associations, making the re-
verse causation hypothesis unlikely. We analysed women with
validated type 2 diabetes only, based on a well-defined vali-
dation algorithm, which reduces the risk of false-negatives or
false-positives. Finally, extensive information on potential
confounders was collected, minimising residual confounding,
and the dietary questionnaire used to assess the total antioxi-
dant capacity intake was validated and specific to this French
population.
Conclusions Our findings suggest that the total antioxidant
capacity of the diet may play a role in reducing the risk of type
2 diabetes in middle-aged women. As type 2 diabetes repre-
sents a high disease burden worldwide, our results may have
important public health implications. More studies are war-
ranted to confirm our findings and better understand the bio-
logical mechanisms that underlie this inverse association.
