Summary
Background GP2015 is a proposed etanercept biosimilar.
Objectives To demonstrate equivalent efficacy, and comparable safety and immuno-
genicity of GP2015 and the etanercept originator (ETN, Enbrel�) in patients with
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
Methods In total, 531 eligible patients were randomized 1 : 1 to self-administer
GP2015 or ETN twice weekly subcutaneously. Patients with ≥ 50% improvement
in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 were rerandomized to
continue the same treatment on a once-weekly dosing schedule or to undergo a
sequence of three treatment switches between GP2015 and ETN until week 30.
Thereafter, patients continued treatment with the product they had been assigned
to last, up to week 52.
Results The difference in PASI 75 (75% improvement from baseline PASI score)
response rates at week 12 between GP2015 and ETN (primary end point) was
�2�3%. The 95% confidence interval (�9�85 to 5�30) was well contained within
the prespecified margin range of �18 to 18. The incidence of treatment-emergent
adverse events up to week 52 was comparable between continued GP2015 (59�8%)
and ETN (57�3%); switching treatments revealed comparable safety profiles. Anti-
drug antibodies, all non-neutralizing, were limited to five patients on ETN during
treatment period 1, and one patient in the switched ETN group, who had been trea-
ted with GP2015 for 12 weeks at the time of the finding.
Conclusions The EGALITY study demonstrated equivalent efficacy and comparable
safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and ETN. The study results provide the
final clinical confirmation of biosimilarity and contribute to the totality of the
evidence proposing that GP2015 is an etanercept biosimilar.

A biosimilar is a biological medicinal product designed to be essentially the same
as the reference biologic (authorized biological medicine – the originator).
•
Biosimilarity is established on the basis of the totality of the evidence based on the
data from analytical, nonclinical, pharmacokinetic and clinical comparisons with
the originator product.
What does this study add?
•
GP2015 is a proposed etanercept biosimilar.
•
EGALITY, the first etanercept biosimilar study in patients with moderate-to-severe
chronic plaque-type psoriasis, was conducted with the purpose of gathering confir-
matory clinical evidence of biosimilarity between GP2015 and the etanercept origi-
nator in a sensitive indication.
•
GP2015 was shown to possess equivalent efficacy to and comparable safety and
immunogenicity with the etanercept originator, with no new or unexpected safety
issues.
Etanercept is a recombinant human tumour necrosis factor
(TNF)-a receptor–p75Fc fusion protein that binds TNF-a with
high affinity and specificity, rendering it biologically inac-
tive.1–4 TNF-a is a naturally occurring cytokine implicated in
a range of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs).
Etanercept has been used successfully in clinical practice for
more than 15 years and is approved for the treatment of mul-
tiple IMIDs, including plaque psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and juvenile idio-
pathic arthritis.
Biological products such as etanercept are derived from
unique bioengineered cells or organisms.5,6 Biosimilars are fol-
low-on versions of authorized biological products.7 Regulatory
authority guidelines require evaluation and confirmation of
biosimilarity between the active substance of a proposed
biosimilar and the approved originator based on the totality of
evidence derived from a complete data package, comprising
physicochemical, biological, nonclinical and clinical data.8,9
GP2015 is a proposed etanercept biosimilar. The bioequiva-
lence of GP2015 with the etanercept originator product (ETN)
has been demonstrated in nonclinical10 and pharmacokinetic
studies.11 The EGALITY study in psoriasis with GP2015 was
conducted to contribute key confirmatory clinical data as part
of the totality of biosimilarity evidence. The objective of this
study was to demonstrate equivalence in efficacy and to com-
pare the safety and immunogenicity of GP2015 and ETN in
patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.
The effects of repeated treatment switching between GP2015
and ETN on efficacy, overall safety and immunogenicity were
also evaluated.
Patients and methods
EGALITY was a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, confir-
matory efficacy and safety study conducted from 24 June
2013 to 30 March 2015, across 74 centres in 11 European
countries and South Africa (NCT01891864).
Study population
Eligible patients included men or women ≥ 18 years of age,
with active but clinically stable chronic plaque-type psoriasis
diagnosed ≥ 6 months before baseline, who had previously
received phototherapy or systemic psoriasis therapy at least
once or who were candidates for such therapies in the opin-
ion of the investigator. Moderate-to-severe psoriasis at baseline
was defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score
≥ 10, an Investigator’s Global Assessment modified 2011 (IGA
mod 2011) score ≥ 3 (based on a scale of 0–4) and ≥ 10%
body surface area affected by plaque-type psoriasis.
Key exclusion criteria were any previous exposure to etaner-
cept;
exposure
to
TNF
antagonists
or
other
biological
immunomodulating agents in the 6 months prior to random-
ization; ongoing use of prohibited psoriasis treatments such as
topical corticosteroids or ultraviolet therapy, or prohibited
nonpsoriasis treatments (all other prior nonpsoriasis concomi-
tant treatments had to be on a stable dose for ≥ 4 weeks
before baseline); presence of active systemic infections in the
2 weeks prior to baseline; or latent tuberculosis detected by
imaging or positive QuantiFERON�TB Gold test. Detailed
exclusion criteria are listed in Appendix S1 (see Supporting
Information).
Study design
The study consisted of four periods (Fig. 1): screening, treat-
ment period 1 (weeks 0–12), treatment period 2 (weeks 13–
30) and an extension phase (weeks 31–52). In treatment
period 1, patients were randomized 1 : 1 to self-administer

twice weekly, subcutaneously. In treatment period 2, patients
who had achieved ≥ 50% improvement in PASI (PASI 50)
from baseline at week 12 were rerandomized either to con-
tinue the same treatment on a once-weekly dosing schedule
(named ‘continued GP2015’ and ‘continued ETN’ groups,
respectively) or to undergo a sequence of three treatment
switches between GP2015 and ETN at 6-weekly intervals until
week 30 (named ‘switched GP2015’ and ‘switched ETN’
groups, respectively). During the extension phase, patients
continued to receive the same treatment received during the
final 6 weeks of treatment period 2 (randomization and other
study details in Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).
This study was conducted in accordance with the ethical
principles derived from the Declaration of Helsinki and Inter-
national Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practices
and in compliance with local regulatory requirements, and
was reviewed and approved by the independent ethics com-
mittee or institutional review board for each centre. All
patients provided written informed consent before entering
the study.
Efficacy assessments
The primary end point was the PASI 75 response rate (propor-
tion of patients showing ≥ 75% improvement in PASI score
from baseline visit) after the first 12 weeks of treatment. The
main secondary end point was the percentage change from
baseline in PASI score up to week 12. Other efficacy variables
assessed at all time points up to week 52 included: (i) PASI
50, 75 and 90 response rates; (ii) observed PASI score; (iii)
percentage change from baseline in PASI score; and (iv) IGA
mod 2011 score assessed using a five-point rating scale12
(Table S1; see Supporting Information).
Pharmacokinetic assessments
Trough serum concentrations of etanercept were assessed at
baseline and at weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 in a subset of 147
patients. The etanercept serum concentrations were quantified
using
a
validated
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
(detailed assay methodology in Appendix S1; see Supporting
Information).
Safety assessments
Adverse event monitoring and injection-site reactions (ISRs)
were assessed at all visits. Adverse events of special interest
were defined by preferred terms encompassing all of the spe-
cial warnings and precautions given on the label for ETN.6
Immunogenicity assessments
The antidrug antibody (ADA) assessment and analysis fol-
lowed a tiered approach, and included a screening assay fol-
lowed by a confirmatory specificity assay and a competitive
ligand binding assay to assess the neutralizing capacity of
ADAs (Appendix S1; see Supporting Information).
Statistical analysis
A sample size of approximately 546 patients to maintain 464
evaluable patients with an assumed dropout and major proto-
col deviation rate of 15% was planned to provide a power of
90% to show therapeutic equivalence between GP2015 and
ETN.
Based on the statistical hypothesis, therapeutic equivalence
in terms of PASI 75 was to be established if the 95% confi-
dence interval (CI) for the difference in the PASI 75 response

 rates was contained within the prespecified margin range
(�18 to 18%). Based on an observed effect size of 45–46% in
former placebo-controlled ETN (Enbrel) studies,3,13 an equiva-
lence margin of 18% was chosen, so that ≥ 60% of the treat-
ment effect had to be maintained.
Primary analysis was performed using a logistic regression
model that included treatment groups (GP2015 or ETN), body
weight categories and prior systemic therapy as stratification
factors in the model. The stratification-factor-adjusted treat-
ment differences between GP2015 and ETN, as well as the
corresponding 95% CIs, were derived from the regression
model. The primary efficacy analysis was based on the per
protocol set (PPS), which consisted of all patients who
completed the study until week 12 without major protocol
deviations. Dropouts due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect
were included in the PPS as nonresponders provided they
received at least 4 weeks of treatment. The analysis was
repeated on the full analysis set (FAS) following the intent-to-
treat principle as a sensitivity analysis.
The main secondary efficacy variable was analysed using a
powered mixed-model repeated-measures approach14 and an
averaged treatment effect approach using an ANCOVA model. No
imputation for missing PASI scores or components of PASI
scores was performed. Both approaches had a prespecified
margin range (�15 to 15%) to claim therapeutic equivalence
and were performed on the PPS and repeated on the FAS. A

Fig 2. Patient disposition from baseline to week 52 (full analysis set). Of the 14 patients who did not enter treatment period 2, five did not
achieve ≥ 50% improvement in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) at week 12 (three others who also did not achieve PASI 50 continued
erroneously in treatment period 2); seven patients discontinued immediately after week 12 (three patients were not rerandomized, four patients
were rerandomized but did not take any study drug in treatment period 2) and two patients achieved PASI 50 at week 12 but had no data beyond
week 12. Of the five patients who did not enter the extension phase, two patients discontinued at their own decision, one discontinued due to a
treatment-emergent adverse event, one discontinued due to lack of efficacy and one was lost to follow-up. The switched GP2015 treatment group
includes patients who switched to treatment sequence ETN?GP2015?ETN at 6-week intervals during treatment period 2, and the switched ETN
treatment group includes patients who switched to treatment sequence GP2015?ETN?GP2015 at 6-week intervals during treatment period 2.
During the extension phase, patients continued receiving the last treatment received during treatment period 2. ETN, etanercept originator

 smaller equivalence margin than for the primary analysis was
chosen because of a lower effect size for the more sensitive
variable percentage change from baseline in PASI score. Addi-
tional details on efficacy analyses and definitions of datasets
are provided in Appendix S1 (see Supporting Information).
Results
Among the 531 randomized patients, the dropout rate was
low (GP2015: n = 8, 3%; ETN: n = 12, 4�5%) during the ini-
tial 12 weeks of treatment. The patient disposition is shown
in Figure 2. The baseline demographics and disease character-
istics of the patients were similar across the two treatment
groups (Table 1).
Efficacy
Primary end point
The treatment difference between GP2015 and ETN (GP2015
� ETN) for adjusted PASI 75 response rates in the PPS
(n = 480) at week 12 was �2�3 (73�4% vs. 75�7%; 95% CI
�9�85 to 5�30) (Fig. 3). As the 95% CI was contained within
the prespecified interval (–18 to 18%), this result demon-
strated therapeutic equivalence between GP2015 and ETN. The
primary end point analysis was further supported by the anal-
ysis on the FAS (Fig. 3).
Main secondary end point
The mean percentage change from baseline to week 12 in
PASI score was similar between GP2015 and ETN (Fig. 4a).
The 95% CIs for the least-squares mean differences in
percentage change from baseline in PASI score (GP2015 �
ETN) up to week 12 for both the mixed-model repeated-
measures (�0�64, 95% CI �3�47 to 2�20) and the averaged
treatment effect (�0�88, 95% CI �3�61 to 1�85) approaches
were contained within the prespecified interval of �15 to
15% (Fig. 4b). These findings on the PPS were supported by
similar
analyses
on
the
FAS
(Fig.
S1;
see
Supporting
Information).
Other end points
From baseline to week 52, the mean scores and percentage
changes from baseline in PASI score at all time points were
comparable between the continued GP2015 and ETN groups
in the PPS, and between the pooled continued and pooled
switched treatment groups (Figs S2, S3; see Supporting Infor-
mation). In all treatment groups, the adjusted PASI 75 and
PASI 90 response rates gradually increased over time until
week 30 and thereafter remained stable until week 52 (Fig. 5;
Fig. S4; see Supporting Information). The adjusted PASI 50
response rate increased until week 12, at which time PASI 50
nonresponders were discontinued from the study (Fig. 5).
The PASI 50 response rate remained stable from week 18 until
week 52 in all treatment groups (Fig. 5; Fig. S4). At baseline,
the majority of patients in the GP2015 (72�0%, 172 of 239)
and ETN (68�9%, 166 of 241) groups had an IGA mod 2011
score of 3. At week 12, the proportion of IGA mod 2011
responders (score of ‘0’ or ‘1’) was numerically higher in the
GP2015 group than in the ETN group (Fig. 6).
Pharmacokinetic results
Trough concentrations
indicated that drug concentrations
reached steady-state systemic levels from week 2 onwards in
both treatment arms, consistent with the reported half-life of
3–4 days for etanercept,6 and were maintained throughout
the 12-week period of evaluation in both treatment groups
(Fig. 4c). Mean etanercept trough levels at weeks 2, 4, 8 and
12, as well as the variability of etanercept trough levels, were
similar within and across both treatment groups, indicating

 sustained exposure to etanercept and comparable clearance of
GP2015 and ETN.
Safety results
The median duration of exposure until 12 weeks was similar
between the GP2015 and ETN groups (81 days), and until
52 weeks was similar between the continued GP2015 and
ETN groups (358 days).
The number of patients with at least one treatment-emer-
gent adverse event (TEAE) up to week 52 was similar between
the continued GP2015 (n = 98, 59�8%) and the continued
ETN groups (n = 98, 57�3%); and between the switched
GP2015 (n = 61, 61%) and switched ETN groups (n = 57,
59%) (Table 2). The incidences of serious adverse events,
study discontinuation due to TEAEs, and treatment-related
TEAEs were similar between the two continued treatment
groups and between the two switched treatment groups
(Table 2; Table S2; see Supporting Information).
The incidence of adverse events of special interest was
higher for continued GP2015 vs. continued ETN (11�0% vs.
4�7%) and for switched GP2015 (11, 11�0%) vs. switched
ETN (five, 5%) (Table S3; see Supporting Information). Malig-
nant melanoma in situ was reported in one patient in the con-
tinued GP2015 group. One patient died during the study, due
to cardiopulmonary failure (in the ETN group in treatment
period 1). The death was suspected to be due to concomitant
conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and was not sus-
pected to be treatment related.
ISRs were reported in 13 (4�9%) patients in the GP2015
group and in 38 (14�2%) patients in the ETN group until
week 12. Most ISRs were mild in both treatment groups (11
patients, 4�2% and 32 patients, 12�0%, respectively). In the
continued GP2015 and continued ETN groups, ISRs were
reported in 14 (8�5%) and 27 (15�8%) patients, respectively,
until week 52; most were mild (13, 7�9% vs. 23, 13�5%,
respectively).
Immunogenicity
Five patients (1�9%) in the ETN group (n = 267) had a con-
firmed positive low-titre non-neutralizing ADA result during
treatment period 1. These responses were detected within the
first 4 weeks of treatment, and the respective patients had
ADA-negative results at all subsequent visits. One patient (1%)
in the switched ETN group (n = 90) showed a confirmed

 positive low-titre non-neutralizing ADA result at week 36 (the
patient was receiving GP2015 for 12 weeks at the time of the
finding), with no other confirmed ADA results in previous or
subsequent visits. No further patients in the study had con-
firmed positive ADA samples.
Discussion
The results of this study confirm the biosimilarity that was
established with all previous analytical comparisons with the
reference product, in that equivalent efficacy was demon-
strated, as well as similar safety and immunogenicity of
GP2015 to ETN in a highly sensitive, generally immunocom-
petent population. In patients with moderate-to-severe chronic
plaque-type psoriasis, GP2015 was shown to be equivalent to
ETN regarding the PASI 75 response rate after 12 weeks of
treatment. This primary end point result was corroborated by
the main secondary efficacy outcome. Other efficacy outcomes
up to week 52 established both the equivalence of efficacy
and lack of difference between long-term treatment with
GP2015 and ETN. Switching these two treatments did not
have any negative effect on efficacy.
A PASI 75 response rate was chosen to demonstrate equiva-
lence between GP2015 and ETN as it is established as a clini-
cally meaningful end point in clinical trials, and is considered
by clinicians to be indicative of success with treatment in
patients with psoriasis.15 The PASI 75 response rates observed
at week 12 in this study were highly comparable between the
treatment groups (GP2015, 73�4%; ETN, 75�7%) even though
they were above the upper range of those reported at week
12
in
previous
studies
with
ETN
in
this
indication
(47–62%).3,13,16–18 Several possible factors could have con-
tributed
to
this
difference.
The
biosimilar
study
design
involves use of two active treatment arms lacking a placebo
comparator, and it has been previously reported that using
only active treatment arms shows an increased effect size com-
pared with placebo-controlled studies.19–22
The PASI 75 analysis was based on the PPS, excluding pro-
tocol violators and dropouts, as it is considered the more sen-
sitive population in equivalence or noninferiority trials,23,24
unlike the FAS, which is based on the intent-to-treat principle
and the last-observation-carried-forward approach, used in
pivotal trials. Also, patients in the EGALITY study had a lower
body weight/body mass index compared with published
data25 (which may have an impact given the fixed-dose regi-
men) and a higher baseline PASI score and higher affected
body surface area than patients in the ETN pivotal studies.3,13
Of
particular
note,
the
long-term
response
rates
(at
24–30 weeks) observed in this study (Fig. 5) were similar to
those observed in previous ETN studies.17,18 Other biosimilar
studies have also reported higher response rates for the pri-
mary efficacy parameter compared with the pivotal studies for
the originator product.21,26–28 Moreover, the EGALITY study
was designed to establish similarity between GP2015 and ETN

 in terms of PASI 75 response, and was not aimed at assessing
changes in PASI 75 response with treatment over time.
The EGALITY trial, establishing the biosimilarity of GP2015
and ETN, contained specific study design attributes, as recom-
mended by health authorities9 and further discussed in the liter-
ature.29,30 These include use of an equivalence design with
prespecified comparability margins justified on both statistical
and clinical grounds by using the data of the originator product,
selection of an indication considered most sensitive for the
comparison, and inclusion of applicable stratification factors in
the statistical model.9,29,30 Patients with psoriasis constitute a
suitable population to demonstrate biosimilarity for TNF-a
inhibitors, because of the enhanced sensitivity for detecting
potential differences in clinical efficacy and immunogenicity in
this indication compared with other approved disease condi-
tions.30 Also, in psoriasis, the selected dosing regimen of
50 mg twice weekly falls into the linear phase of the dose–re-
sponse curve, in which differences in dose can translate into dif-
ferences in efficacy.3 In addition, there is generally no
concomitant immunosuppressive therapy in psoriasis treatment
with etanercept, resulting in an unbiased and sensitive detection
of any potential difference in immunogenicity.
In a preceding pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers,
the pharmacokinetics of GP2015 were shown to be bioequiva-
lent to those of ETN.11 In this study, trough serum concentra-
tion levels of GP2015 or ETN measured after multiple
subcutaneous doses were similar within and across both treat-
ment groups, providing further evidence of similar pharma-
cokinetics of GP2015 and ETN.
The incidence of TEAEs up to week 52 was generally compa-
rable between the treatment groups, and no new or unexpected
safety issues were reported. Overall, the safety profiles of both
GP2015 and ETN were in line with previous large-scale ETN
studies.3,13 The incidence of ISRs up to 12 weeks was lower
with GP2015 (4�9%) than with ETN (14�2%), while the inci-
dence in the ETN group was consistent with those reported in
previous ETN studies (13%3 and 18%13). Although the reasons
for the lower incidence of ISRs cannot be fully elucidated, a
possible reason could be the difference in formulation between
the two products, as has been reported in other biosimilar stud-
ies.21 The higher incidence of TEAEs of special interest reported
with GP2015 during the study was not caused by an increased
number of events in any specific system organ class, but was
due to events spread across several system organ classes, with
most occurring in just one patient each in the continued
GP2015 group vs. none in the continued ETN group. Safety was
not affected by switching treatments.
Etanercept is known to have a lower incidence of immuno-
genicity than other TNF-a inhibitors.31,32 The incidence of
ADAs during the study was low and consistent with that
reported in other large-scale ETN trials in psoriasis;3,13,16 six
patients were ADA positive and all lacked neutralizing antibod-
ies. Switching from ETN to GP2015 or vice versa did not lead
to increased ADA formation.
In conclusion, the efficacy of GP2015 was equivalent to that
of ETN in patients with moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type
psoriasis. There were no clinically meaningful differences in
efficacy, safety or immunogenicity between GP2015 and ETN
up to 52 weeks of treatment. No new or unexpected safety
issues were reported, and the safety profiles of GP2015 and
ETN were similar to those observed in previous ETN studies.
