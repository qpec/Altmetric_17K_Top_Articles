Abstract
IMPORTANCE—The burden and determinants of complications and comorbidities in 
contemporary youth-onset diabetes are unknown.
OBJECTIVE—To determine the prevalence of and risk factors for complications related to type 1 
diabetes vs type 2 diabetes among teenagers and young adults who had been diagnosed with 
diabetes during childhood and adolescence.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Observational study from 2002 to 2015 in 5 US 
locations, including 2018 participants with type 1 and type 2 diabetes diagnosed at younger than 
20 years, with single outcome measures between 2011 and 2015.
EXPOSURES—Type 1 and type 2 diabetes and established risk factors (hemoglobin A1c level, 
body mass index, waist-height ratio, and mean arterial blood pressure).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, peripheral 
neuropathy, cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy, arterial stiffness, and hypertension.
RESULTS—Of 2018 participants, 1746 had type 1 diabetes (mean age, 17.9 years [SD 4.1]; 1327 
non-Hispanic white [76.0%]; 867 female patients [49.7%]), and 272 had type 2 (mean age, 22.1

 years [SD 3.5]; 72 non-Hispanic white [26.5%]; 181 female patients [66.5%]). Mean diabetes 
duration was 7.9 years (both groups). Patients with type 2 diabetes vs those with type 1 had higher 
age-adjusted prevalence of all measured complications except cardiovascular autonomic 
neuropathy. After adjustment for established risk factors measured over time, participants with 
type 2 diabetes vs those with type 1 had significantly higher odds of diabetic kidney disease, 
retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy but no significant difference in the odds of arterial stiffness 
and hypertension.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—Among teenagers and young adults who had been 
diagnosed with diabetes during childhood or adolescence, the prevalence of complications and 
comorbidities was higher among those with type 2 diabetes compared with type 1, but frequent in 
both groups. These findings support early monitoring of youth with diabetes for development of 
complications.
The increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children and adolescents has been 
relatively recent in most populations,1–3 beginning in the early to mid-1990s. Additionally, a 
long-term increase in type 1 diabetes has been observed both worldwide4 and in the United 
States.3 These recent epidemiologic trends in type 1 and type 2 diabetes diagnosed in young 
individuals raise the question of whether the pattern of complications differs by diabetes 
type at similar ages and diabetes duration. Recent studies have reported higher prevalence of 
some5–7 but not all8 complications in children and adolescents with type 2 diabetes 
compared with those with type 1. Reasons for discrepancies across previous studies include 
population differences, relatively small sample sizes, variable length of duration of diabetes 
at outcome assessment, variable ages, and reliance on routine clinical or administrative 
records to document outcomes. Preliminary findings have suggested that there is a higher 
prevalence of selected complications and risk factors among adolescents and young adults 
with type 2 diabetes compared with type 1.9
Given those findings, this study was designed as an outcomes evaluation to comprehensively 
estimate the prevalence of multiple diabetes-related complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, 
and nephropathy) and comorbidities (hypertension and arterial stiffness) by type of diabetes.

 The a priori hypothesis was that the prevalence of complications and comorbidities would be 
higher in adolescents and young adults with type 2 diabetes compared with those with type 
1. The secondary hypothesis was that the increased prevalence of complications would be 
reduced, at least in part, by adjustment for longitudinally measured established risk factors, 
including glycemia (hemoglobin A1c level), obesity (body mass index [BMI]; waist-height 
ratio), and blood pressure (mean arterial pressure).
Methods
Study Population
Children and adolescents with diabetes diagnosed at younger than 20 years were identified 
from a population-based incidence registry network at 5 US sites (South Carolina; 
Cincinnati, Ohio, and surrounding counties; Colorado with southwestern Native American 
sites; Seattle, Washington, and surrounding counties; and Kaiser Permanente, Southern 
California) by the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth registry study.9 Patients received a new 
diagnosis of type 1 or type 2 diabetes in 2002–2006 or 2008 and were identified from 
ongoing surveillance of networks of hospitals and other clinical sites. Patients who could be 
contacted were recruited for a baseline visit (mean of 9.3 months [SD, 6.4] from diagnosis) 
and, if they completed it, were asked to return for visits at 12, 24, and 60 months to measure 
risk factors for diabetes complications (Figure 1).
A subset of participants aged 10 years or older who had at least 5 years of diabetes duration 
(to increase the likelihood of detection of complications) were recruited for an outcome visit 
between 2011 and 2015 (mean of 7.9 years [SD, 1.9] from diagnosis), for whom a single 
prevalent measurement of diabetes-related complications and comorbidities was completed. 
A flowchart depicting included and excluded participants is shown in Figure 2. The study 
was approved by institutional review boards with jurisdiction, and for all participants, the 
parent, adolescent or young adult, or both provided consent or assent.
Research Visits
Trained personnel administered questionnaires, made measurements, and obtained blood 
samples. Because race and ethnicity are often related to differing disease outcomes, US 
census methods10 were used that provided a series of fixed race and ethnicity categories, as 
well as an “other” option for the self-report by parent or participant, depending on age. 
These were further categorized into non-Hispanic white and minority racial/ethnic groups, 
including Hispanic (regardless of race), non-Hispanic black, American Indian, Asian/Pacific 
Islander, and other or multiple races/ethnicities. Education and income were self-reported. 
Body mass index was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared 
and converted to a z score.11 Waist circumference was measured with the natural waist 
location and was used to calculate the ratio of waist to height. The mean of 3 systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure levels was obtained with an aneroid manometer after at least 5 
minutes of rest. A blood draw occurred after an 8-hour overnight fast, and medications, 
including short-acting insulin, were withheld the morning of the visit.

 Laboratory Measures
Specimens were analyzed for glutamic acid decarboxylase–65 antibodies and insulinoma-
associated-2 antibodies at the central laboratory12 (Northwest Lipid Metabolism and 
Diabetes Research). Zinc-T8 autoantibody was analyzed at the Eisenbarth Laboratory 
(University of Colorado).13 Levels of fasting C-peptide, hemoglobin A1c, glucose, lipids, 
creatinine, cystatin C, and urine albumin and creatinine were also measured.
Type of Diabetes
Diabetes type was defined with an etiologic classification14,15 based on 1 or more positive 
diabetes autoantibody results and estimated insulin sensitivity score (validated equation 
including waist circumference and hemoglobin A1c and triglyceride levels) at the baseline 
visit. Type 1 diabetes was defined as at least 1 positive antibody result, regardless of insulin 
sensitivity, or no positive antibody results and insulin sensitivity (score ≥8.15). Type 2 
diabetes was defined as negative antibody results and insulin sensitivity (score <8.15).
Outcome Measures
Diabetic Kidney Disease—A first-morning urine void at home was brought to the 
outcome visit by 92% of participants, and if not available (in 8%), a spot sample was used. 
Diabetic kidney disease was defined as the presence of albuminuria (≥30μg/mg of 
creatinine) or estimated glomerular filtration rate less than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 
with the CKD-Epi equations with serum creatinine and cystatin C.16 Only 1 participant was 
classified as having diabetic kidney disease according to low estimated glomerular filtration 
rate.
Diabetic retinopathy was determined by grading 45° color digital fundus images centered on 
the disc and macula of both eyes, taken with a nonmydriatic camera (Visucam Pro N; Carl 
Zeiss Meditech). The Wisconsin Ocular Epidemiology Reading Center graded photos 
masked to all clinical characteristics. Retinopathy severity was based on the worse eye and 
categorized as none, minimal nonproliferative, mild to moderate nonproliferative, or 
proliferative.17 Diabetic retinopathy was defined as presence of mild, moderate, or 
proliferative retinal changes.
Peripheral neuropathy was assessed with the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument 
examination and was defined as a score greater than 2.18,19
Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy—Assessment of heart rate variability used the 
SphygmoCor-Vx device (AtCor Medical).20 Indices of heart rate variability were derived 
from the electrocardiographic R-R intervals and included standard deviation of the intervals, 
root mean square differences of successive intervals, normalized high frequency power, 
normalized low-frequency power, and the low-frequency to high-frequency ratio. 
Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy was defined as at least 3 of 5 abnormalities based on 
fifth or lower percentiles or 95th or greater percentiles of data observed in age- and sex-
matched control participants in the SEARCH Cardiovascular Disease ancillary study.20

 Arterial Stiffness—Pulse wave velocity was measured in the carotid–femoral arterial 
segment with the SphygmoCor-Vx device. A pulse wave velocity of 90th centile or greater 
of controls from the SEARCH Cardiovascular Disease study defined arterial stiffness.21
Hypertension—Hypertension was defined as blood pressure levels 95th or greater centile 
for age (<18 years),22 140/90 mm Hg or higher (≥18 years), or relevant medical therapy.23
Statistical Methods
Descriptive analyses calculated the mean (SD) or median (interquartile range [when data 
were not normally distributed]) for continuous variables and the number and percentage for 
categorical variables. Variables labeled “current” were from the outcomes visit and those 
labeled “mean over time” were the mean of all available visits from baseline to the outcomes 
visit (maximum possible = 5 visits). Hemoglobin A1c levels (glucose control), BMI levels 
(overall obesity), and waist height ratio (central obesity) from all visits were averaged. Mean 
arterial pressure was calculated as ([2 × diastolic] + systolic)/3 at each visit and averaged.
Prevalence of Outcomes
The prevalence of each outcome was estimated at age 21 years by diabetes type, as well as 
by type and race/ethnicity, with logistic regression. Absolute differences and 95% CIs were 
calculated from the age-adjusted prevalence estimates.
Risk Factors and Prevalence Differences
To understand which risk factors were associated with prevalence differences, odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% CIs for the associations between diabetes type (type 2 vs 1) and each 
outcome were computed in sequentially adjusted models. A base model adjusted for age, 
sex, duration of diabetes, and clinical site. Additional models explored whether adjustment 
for individual covariates reduced the strength of the associations: race/ethnicity, hemoglobin 
A1c level, BMI, waist-height ratio, and mean arterial pressure averaged over time (except 
when hypertension was the outcome, in which case mean arterial pressure was not included). 
A final model explored the changes in the ORs, with adjustment for all risk factors (except 
BMI, which was highly correlated with waist-height ratio). Model fit was determined with 
the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Analyses used SASversion9.4. All analyses 
used 2-sided P = .05 as statistically significant and were not adjusted for multiple 
comparisons. No formal tests for interaction were conducted.
Results
There were 2018 adolescents and young adults for this analysis. Table 1 shows that 
participants with type 1 diabetes and those with type 2 had a distribution of characteristics 
similar to those of the registry population from which they came on demographic factors 
(average diabetes onset age, sex, and race/distribution) and similar to those of the 
participants with a baseline visit on important clinical variables (hemoglobin A1c level, BMI 
converted to a z score, waist circumference, waist height ratio, and fasting C-peptide and 
blood pressure levels) and socioeconomic factors (insurance, household income, and 
parental education).

 Table 2 shows demographic and clinical characteristics by type of diabetes. Compared with 
patients with type 1 diabetes, those with type 2 were older at diagnosis (mean age, 14.2 vs 
10.0 years at diagnosis) and at the outcome visit (mean age, 22.1 vs 17.9 years), with a 
higher proportion of female participants (66.5% vs 49.7%) and minority participants (non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic, American Indian, and other) (73.5% vs 24.0%). Duration of 
diabetes at the outcome visit was 7.9 years for both groups. Neither current nor mean 
hemoglobin A1c levels were significantly different for participants with type 1 and type 2 
diabetes. Measures of obesity and mean arterial pressure (current and mean over time) were 
significantly higher in type 2 diabetes than in type 1. A total of 72 type 2 diabetes 
participants (27%)did not report treatment with diabetes medications at the outcomes study 
visit.
Table 3 shows the number of outcomes observed and the age-adjusted prevalence for each 
outcome at aged 21 years by type of diabetes and by both type and race/ethnicity, along with 
absolute differences. A higher prevalence of complications and comorbidities was observed 
overall among adolescents and young adults with type 2 diabetes compared with type 1, with 
the exception of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy.
A total of 44 participants (19.9%) with type 2 diabetes had diabetic kidney disease compared 
with 89 participants (5.8%) with type 1 diabetes (absolute difference, 14.0%; 95% CI, 9.1%–
19.9%; P < .001). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was also significantly higher for 
type 2 diabetes participants than for type 1 (type 2 diabetes, n = 36, 9.1%; type 1 diabetes, n 
= 71, 5.6%; absolute difference, 3.5%; 95% CI, 0.4%–7.7%; P = .02).
The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy was also higher in participants with type 2 diabetes 
vs type 1 overall (n = 58 vs 110; 17.7%vs 8.5%; absolute difference, 9.2%; 95%CI, 4.8–
14.4; P < .001) and in both racial/ethnic groups.
Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy prevalence was not significantly different overall 
among type 2 and type 1 diabetes participants (n = 43 vs 197; 15.7% vs 14.4%; absolute 
difference, 1.2%; 95% CI, −3.1 to 6.5; P = .62). Because of poor model fit for race/ethnicity 
subsets, strata-specific comparisons of cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy prevalence by 
diabetes type could not be made.
Arterial stiffness prevalence was significantly higher among participants with type 2 diabetes 
vs those with type 1 (n = 107 vs 137;47.4%vs 11.6%; absolute difference, 35.9%; 95% CI, 
29%–42.9%; P < .001) and among both non-Hispanic whites and minority participants with 
type 2 diabetes compared with type 1, with an estimated prevalence of 55.4%in minority 
adolescents and young adults with type 2 diabetes (n = 86).
Hypertension prevalence was significantly higher in participants with type 2 diabetes vs type 
1 (n = 66 vs 141; 21.6% vs 10.1%; absolute difference, 11.5%; 95% CI, 6.8%–16.9%; P < .
001), including among non-Hispanic white and minority groups.
Overall, 195 teenagers and young adults with type 2 diabetes (72%) and 562 of those with 
type 1 diabetes (32%) had evidence of at least 1 early diabetes-related complication or 
comorbidity.

 Table 4 includes sequentially adjusted models for the associations of diabetes type and each 
outcome to determine whether established risk factors contributed to the higher prevalence 
among those with type 2 diabetes vs type 1. The base model (adjusted for age, sex, duration 
of diabetes, and clinical site) showed significantly higher rates of complications for type 2 
diabetes vs type 1 for all outcomes, except for cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy. 
Adjustment for race/ethnicity did not attenuate the higher odds of complications associated 
with type 2 diabetes vs type 1 for any of the outcomes explored. For diabetic kidney disease, 
retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy, further adjustment for multiple risk factors did not 
attenuate the significantly higher odds of complications for type 2 diabetes vs type 1 
prevalence, although for retinopathy, inclusion of mean arterial pressure alone attenuated the 
OR to nonsignificance. For arterial stiffness and hypertension, adjustment for waist-height 
ratio attenuated the OR to nonsignificance. With inclusion of multiple risk factors in the 
final model, the associations of diabetes type with arterial stiffness and hypertension were no 
longer significant.
Discussion
In this cohort of teenagers and young adults who had received a diagnosis of diabetes during 
childhood and adolescence, the prevalence of diabetes-related complications was higher 
among those with type 2 diabetes than with type 1, but the prevalence was substantial in 
both groups. At an estimated age of 21 years and after 7.9 years’ mean diabetes duration, 
approximately 1 in 3 teenagers and young adults with type 1 diabetes (32%) and almost 3 of 
4 of those with type 2 diabetes (72%) had at least 1 such complication or comorbidity, and 
these rates are likely to increase. Moreover, these complications disproportionately affected 
teenagers and young adults with type 2 diabetes. Participants were phenotyped to avoid 
misclassification by diabetes type and were followed from near onset of diabetes, with 
multiple risk factor measures over time and a single standardized assessment of diabetes 
complications and comorbidities. These results were from a US study of adolescents and 
young adults with youth-onset type 1 and type 2 diabetes whose data were drawn from a 
population-based registry. The current data, coupled with previouswork,3 suggest that the 
participants in this analysis are reasonably representative of the general US population with 
onset of type 1 and type 2 diabetes in childhood or adolescence.
The microvascular complications of diabetic kidney disease, retinopathy, and peripheral 
neuropathy were significantly elevated among teenagers and young adults with type 2 
diabetes vs those with type 1 after adjustment for glycemic control, central obesity, and 
blood pressure levels over time. In several studies, both diabetic kidney disease and 
peripheral neuropathy have been reported as elevated in individuals with youth-onset type 2 
diabetes.5,6,24–26 There is less consistency in regard to retinopathy, with several studies 
finding no significant difference in prevalence among youth-onset type 2 diabetes compared 
with patients with type 1 diabetes.5–7,24,27,28
Two studies found a higher prevalence of retinopathy among patients with type 2 diabetes 
compared with those with type 1 diabetes,25,29 as did a previous pilot study.30 We found that 
the higher prevalence of retinopathy (as well as that of diabetic kidney disease) was 
primarily among minority adolescents and young adults with type 2 diabetes. Although it is

 possible that obesity played a role in the higher prevalence of retinopathy among patients 
with type 2 diabetes, the TODAY study found that among young persons with type 2 
diabetes, retinopathy prevalence was lower among the highest tertile of obesity than among 
the lower tertiles.31
In the present study, the OR for retinopathy among patients with type 2 diabetes vs type 1 
remained significant when measures of obesity were added in the logistic regression models, 
but was attenuated and became nonsignificant when arterial pressure was included (Table 4). 
These analyses suggest that mean arterial pressure may be an important factor that 
influenced the difference in retinopathy prevalence between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, 
although after inclusion of mean arterial pressure and other risk factors in the fully adjusted 
model, the OR indicating higher odds of retinopathy among type 2 diabetes vs type 1 
remained significant. Given the young age of this group, only a small proportion received 
medications to control hypertension or dyslipidemia. For hypertension, this proportion was 
between 2% and 8%, and for dyslipidemia itwasbetween1%and4%, depending on the visit. 
In a sensitivity analysis, the association between medication use and complications was 
minimal.
Because the greater association of microvascular complications in type 2 diabetes compared 
with type 1 remained significant after adjusting for established risk factors, these data 
indicate a need to explore other potential pathways, such as inflammatory markers, 
endothelial dysfunction, advanced glycation end products, endogenous inhibitors of nitric 
oxide synthase, markers of renal tubular dysfunction, and dietary factors. These results do 
not imply that glucose control (clearly important for the development of microvascular 
complications for both type 132 and type 2 diabetes33), obesity, and blood pressure were not 
important risk factors; however, including these variables in the analytic models did not 
attenuate the associations of higher prevalence of microvascular complications among 
teenagers and young adults with type 2 diabetes vs type 1.
The higher prevalence of microvascular complications in patients with type 2 diabetes vs 
type 1 and the relatively high prevalence among patients with type 1 diabetes present a 
challenge to clinicians. Patients with type 2 diabetes often have limited access to services 
and less than optimal participation in satisfactory treatment regimens for multiple economic, 
behavioral, and social reasons.34 Glycemic control goals are not easy to meet among 
adolescents, regardless of diabetes type.35,36 It is possible that microvascular complications 
are more aggressive in adolescents and young adults with type 2 diabetes than in those with 
type 1 diabetes, resulting in greater prevalence at the same diabetes duration. Incidence data 
will be required to confirm this observation. Whether the smaller prevalence among 
adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes, especially those of non-Hispanic white 
background, could be related to more aggressive treatment in general must also be further 
explored.
Comorbid outcomes included hypertension and arterial stiffness, both of which had higher 
prevalence among patients with type 2 diabetes and in minorities with either diabetes type. 
The significantly higher prevalence for both outcomes in unadjusted analyses was reduced to 
nonsignificance with adjustment for risk factors, primarily waist-height ratio, indicating that

 differences in central obesity were associated with the type 2 diabetes excess. Given that 
cardiovascular disease25 and mortality7 have been shown to be higher in young-onset type 2 
diabetes than in young-onset type 1 diabetes, as well as in young-onset vs later-onset type 2 
diabetes,37 the presence of arterial stiffness and hypertension at a young age, together with 
an increased prevalence of risk factors9 and diabetic kidney disease, suggests that these 
patients may be at increased risk for subsequent cardiovascular events.
This study has several strengths. The study population was drawn from what is, to our 
knowledge, the largest multiethnic population-based registry of pediatric diabetes in the 
United States and has demographic and clinical characteristics similar to those of the overall 
population from which it draws.3 Even though the outcomes were based on cross-sectional 
assessment, risk factors were measured longitudinally at previous visits, allowing the 
determination of the relationship of glucose control, markers of overall and central obesity, 
and mean blood pressure levels over time with differences in the prevalence of 
complications by diabetes type.
This study also has some limitations. First, a single measure of each outcome was used, 
without repeated testing. Second, there were relatively small numbers of participants with 
some outcomes, especially in subgroups by race/ethnicity. Third, the analysis of risk factors 
that might explain differences by type of diabetes did not include all possible factors and 
pathways. Fourth, it is possible that participants with youth-onset type 2 diabetes had a 
longer period of undetected glycemia such that the duration of hyperglycemia was longer 
than for type 1 diabetes. Data are not available in this study to address this question; 
however, surveys of high-risk minority youths have identified few with undiagnosed type 2 
diabetes in cross-sectional surveys of glucose intolerance.38,39 If youth-onset type 2 diabetes 
had a longer preclinical course, it would be expected that a larger number of such 
undiagnosed cases would be identified. Fourth, the mean number of measures of risk factors 
was 3.2 for patients with type 1 diabetes and 3.0 for those with type 2 diabetes, so it is 
possible that the true excursions of hemoglobin A1c level and blood pressure were 
underestimated. This could have led to less ability to fully characterize the associations of 
hemoglobin A1c level and blood pressure with complications according to type of diabetes. 
Fifth, there were a large number of end points compared, without adjustment for multiple 
comparisons, so it is possible that some of the statistically significant findings represent type 
I error.
Conclusions
Among teenagers and young adults who had been diagnosed with diabetes during childhood 
and adolescence, the prevalence of complications and comorbidities was higher among those 
with type 2 diabetes compared with type 1, but frequent in both groups. These findings 
support early monitoring of these patients for development of complications.

 Key Points
Question
What is the prevalence of complications of type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes among 
teenagers and young adults who had been diagnosed during childhood and adolescence?
Findings
In an observational study of 1746 patients with type 1 diabetes and 272 with type 2 
diabetes with onset younger than 20 years, the prevalence of diabetic kidney disease, 
retinopathy, and peripheral neuropathy was significantly greater in patients with type 2 
diabetes, even after adjustment for differences in hemoglobin A1c level, body mass index, 
waist-height ratio, and mean arterial blood pressure.
Meaning
Among teenagers and young adults who had been diagnosed with diabetes during 
childhood and adolescence, the prevalence of complications was higher among those with 
type 2 diabetes compared with type 1 diabetes, but frequent in both groups.

 Figure 1. Design of the SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth Cohort Study
Risk factors measured at baseline, follow-up, and outcome visits included glycemia 
(measured as hemoglobin A1c), obesity (body mass index and waist-height ratio), and blood 
pressure levels. Outcomes measured at the outcome visits included diabetic retinopathy, 
neuropathy, nephropathy, hypertension, and arterial stiffness.
