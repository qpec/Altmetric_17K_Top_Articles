Background: The effects of sex, age, and season on blood analyte concentrations
have not been investigated for the killer whale (Orcinus orca). Defining these
changes provides background data for improving the care of managed populations
and defines normal changes that could occur in wild counterparts.
Objectives: We aimed to define hematologic and serum biochemical variation by
age, sex, and season for an ex situ killer whale population.
Methods: Blood samples collected from killer whales during normal wellness exams
were retrospectively identified. Killer whales were categorized by age; calf (0‐
2.9 years), juvenile (3‐10.9 years), early adult (11‐20.9 years), adult (21‐30.9 years),
and aged (>30.9 years); sex; and season. Standard CBC and biochemistry were col-
lated, and only samples without evidence of disease were used. A mixed effects
maximum likelihood regression with animal identification (ID) as the random effects
variable was used to compare groups with a significance set at P ≤ 0.01.
Results: All analytes differed by age, while only four differed by sex. Red blood cell
parameters and associated renal analytes increased with age, while liver‐associated
analytes and glucose decreased. Season affected 59% of the blood analytes.
Conclusions: Aged killer whales showed strong evidence of altered physiology as
compared with younger animals. Anemia did not develop with age as was observed
in one bottlenose dolphin population. Observed decreases in renal function could
be caused by chronic disease or dehydration. Decreases in immune function param-
eters suggest immune senescence. These results provide background data for evalu-
ating the health of managed and free‐ranging killer whales.

INTRODUCTION
The analysis of blood analytes is an important tool in an individual's
health assessment. Hematology and serum chemistry are used to
diagnose and evaluate physiologic, reproductive, and pathologic con-
ditions.1 Ideally, analyte levels for an individual are compared against
historical values from the same individual, or more commonly against

 the distribution of values from a reference population. The expected
values observed in an individual that deviate from the reference
population provide diagnostic information that can aid in selecting
individual management procedures. Aging, physiologic conditions,
environmental factors, and diseases can all cause deviations in the
enzyme, metabolite, and mineral contents of an individual.1–3 In
many species, reference intervals (RIs) have been determined for
specific age and sex categories, resulting in a more sensitive and
accurate tool to evaluate physiology and diagnose disease, while also
providing insights into the physiology of aging.4–7
Cetaceans represent an animal group that comprises all dolphins,
porpoises, and whales. A small number of studies have reported on
the clinicopathologic analytes of cetaceans, and a subset investigated
host and environmental influences on these analytes. However,
these studies almost exclusively focused on bottlenose dolphins and
beluga whales.8–21 While variability was detected in these studies,
no consistent drivers of the variabilities were detected across studies
or species. Challenges and limitations, especially relating to earlier
studies, included low numbers of animals and samples, unknown
health histories, different laboratory methods, and no control mea-
sures to account for fasting status and serum quality.
The first study reporting on pathologic data from killer whales
(Orcinus orca) dates back to 197922; however, this study did not
include hematology or biochemistry data. The first study reporting
clinicopathologic RIs for killer whales was published in 1983, but
samples were collected, and data were analyzed from only 14
whales, and the analytical methodologies used are, in most cases, no
longer available.23 The ex situ killer whale population housed at the
SeaWorld facilities provides a unique window into killer whale physi-
ology, and clinicopathologic data collected from this population were
recently used to describe physiologic changes which are observed
during normal pregnancies (Robeck and Nollens, 2013).24 The results
of managed population studies are particularly valuable because they
allow for longer term follow‐up of individuals of known age, health,
and reproductive and nutritional statuses. Using data from 2823
blood samples collected as part of the routine preventative medicine
program from 32 killer whales over a 22‐year period, the main objec-
tives of this study were (a) to describe normal hematologic and
serum biochemical analyte variation in clinically healthy killer whales;
(b) to examine the effects of age, sex, and season on this variation;
and (c) to generate insights into biological changes associated with
aging in killer whales.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Thirty‐two killer whales (Orcinus orca) were group housed in natural
daylight habitats containing a minimum of 19 000 000 L natural or
synthetic (Univar, Redmond, WA, USA) recirculating salt water that
was maintained at approximately 14°C year‐round. Animals were fed
a diet of frozen‐thawed whole fish which contained some or all of
the following fish: Pacific herring (Clupea harengus), sardines (Sardi-
nops sagas), Columbia River smelt (Thaleichthys pacificus), Pacific
mackerel (Scomber japonicas), capelin (Mallotus villosus), and pink
salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) at approximately 2%‐3% of their
body weight per day. All food fish was suitable for human consump-
tion. Animals were supplemented with Vita‐Zu Marine Mammal mul-
tivitamin tablets (Mazuri, St. Louis, MO, USA).
Fasting blood samples that were routinely collected and analyzed
from all whales either bi‐weekly or monthly as part of SeaWorld's
preventative medicine program between January 10, 1993 and
October 16, 2013 provided the retrospective data for this study. To
restrict the data to samples which had been collected from clinically
healthy killer whales, samples drawn while on medication, other than
multivitamin tablets, were excluded. For deceased whales, samples
drawn within 30 days of death were excluded.20 Based on the previ-
ously demonstrated effects of gestation and lactation on hemato-
logic parameters (Robeck and Nollens, 2013),24 all samples collected
18 months before and 6 months after parturition or while serum
progesterone
levels
were
elevated
(>5000 pg/mL)
for
at
least
5 weeks were excluded. Blood samples with any degree of hemolysis
were excluded (Morgan et al, 1999).25
For venipuncture, the whales were trained to present the ventral
surface of their fluke to the attending veterinarian for sampling using
a 19‐gauge 1.5‐inch needle. Blood was collected into BD Vacutainer
tubes (Becton Dickenson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) containing potas-
sium‐EDTA, sodium citrate, or thrombin. Hemoglobin concentration
(Hb), red blood cell count (RBC), the mean corpuscular volume
(MCV), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), platelet count (plate-
let), mean platelet volume (MPV), reticulocyte fraction (Retic), total
white blood cell count (WBC), and segmented neutrophil (Abs segs),
absolute lymphocyte (Abs lymphs), monocyte (Abs monos), and eosi-
nophil counts (Abs eos), and erythrocyte sedimentation rates at
60 minutes (ESR 60) were measured using EDTA‐anticoagulated
blood. Samples were processed using the SeaWorld on‐site diagnos-
tic laboratory. The analytes Hb, RBC, MCV, RDW, platelet, MPV,
Retic, and WBC were determined using either an Abbott Cell Dyn
3500R (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA) or Siemens Advia
2120i (Siemens Medical Solutions USA, Inc., Malvern, PA, USA) auto-
mated hematology analyzer using the manufacturer's reagents. From
these analytes, hematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular hemoglobin
(MCH), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC)
were calculated. The differential cell counts were derived by manu-
ally
counting

Wright‐
Giemsa‐stained smears and then calculating the Abs segs, Abs
lymphs, Abs monos, and Abs eos from the percentages multiplied by
the WBCs. The biochemical parameters glucose, urea (BUN), crea-

sodium (Na), potassium (K), chloride (Cl), CO2, and iron were mea-
sured using either the Ciba Corning Fast 4 (Ciba Corning, Cambridge,
MA, USA) or the Olympus AU400E (Olympus Corporation, Center
Valley, PA, USA) automated serum chemistry analyzer on thrombin‐

quantified
using
the
Organon
Teknika
Coag‐a‐mate
(Organon
Teknika Corporation, Durham, NC, USA) or the Sysmex CA‐500 (Sys-
mex America, Winter Springs, FL, USA) on citrate‐anticoagulated
blood. The estimated sedimentation rate (ESR) 60 was determined
using a Sediplast Westergren ESR system (LP Italiana SPA, Milan,
Italy). Correlation studies were conducted when equipment was tran-
sitioned as part of the best laboratory practices program, by analyz-
ing 30 blood or serum samples on both pieces of equipment and
calculating the linear correlation coefficient (R2) for each analyte (R2
range 0.916‐0.995). The on‐site ASCP certified clinical laboratory sci-
entists and field service engineers performed and documented ana-
lyzer calibrations and maintenance, and installed analyzer updates as
prescribed by the manufacturer's recommended maintenance sched-
ule to ensure instrument performance and reliability. On a regular
basis, all clinical and analytical methods were tested with a multi-
level, matched matrix, QC material at a minimum frequency as rec-
ommended
by
the
assay
manufacturer.

results
were
compared to establish RIs and validate assay performance.
For analysis, age at the time of sampling (in years) was calculated
by subtracting the date of sampling by either the known or esti-
mated birth date, divided by 365. For wild caught or stranded ani-
mals, a birth date of January 1st of the estimated birth year as
estimated based on body length at capture (Robeck et al, 2015).26
Each sample was assigned to one of five age categories (coded 0‐4),
defined as calf (0‐2.99 years), juvenile (3‐10.99 years), early adult
(11‐20.99 years), adult (21‐30.99 years), and aged (>30.99 years).
Samples were allocated by season (coded 0‐3) as follows: spring
(March 1‐May 31), summer (June 1‐August 31), fall (September 1‐
November 30), and winter (December 1‐February 29).

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using Stata statistical software
(version 14; StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). A two‐stage
mixed effects maximum likelihood (ML) regression model27,28 (West
et al.,2015, Robeck et al., 2017) quantifying the relationship between
the dependent variable (analyte), the fixed effects variable (stage 1,
animal age or age category, sex, and season) and the random effects
variable, animal ID (stage 2, n = 11, coded 1‐32), was used to control
for the variance associated with an unequal number of repeated mea-
sures per animal. The mixed effects model was used because it can
incorporate the effect of the variance associated with the unbalanced
design between and the correlated repeated measures from within
each animal with the effects of any independent or fixed variables to
predict their collective effect on the sample means (marginal means).
The variation associated with the full model (all fixed and random
effects) was initially determined, and then each fixed effects variable
was removed iteratively in a backward direction. The two models
were then compared (with and without the individual fixed effects
variable that had been removed) using the LR test at a P < 0.05. The
variable was then retained or omitted depending on whether it con-
tributed significantly toward the model explanation (final model) of
the dependent variable. For brevity, only fixed variables with signifi-
cant effects were discussed in the results. All final mixed models were
checked for normality using quantile plots of the standard residuals. If
quantile‐quantile (qnorm) plots of standardized residuals exhibited
non‐normal distributions, then data were transformed as predicted by
the Shapiro‐Wilk test (Ladder command, STATA) until residuals were
normalized. Finally, pairwise comparisons of the predicted marginal
means between and within the fixed variables were made while
applying the Šidák correction factor at a significance level of
P < 0.01. For text and tables, any transformed data were first back‐
transformed, and then all data were presented as marginal means with
95% confidence intervals (CI) unless noted otherwise.

RESULTS
The 32 killer whales consisted of 13 males (M) and 19 females (F). A
total of 2823 blood samples met the inclusion criteria and were
included in the study, resulting in 45 168 hematology and 64 929
serum chemistry data points. Ages at which blood samples were
drawn ranged from 0.3 to 47.6 years with a respective mean and
median of 14.2 and 11.8 years. The dataset consisted of 221 blood
samples from calves (9 M & 7 F), 1,084 blood samples from juvenile
whales (11 M &11 F), 794 blood samples from early adults (9 M &
11 F), 476 blood samples from adults (4 M & 9 F), and 248 blood
samples from aged whales (1 M & 3 F). Seven hundred and one
blood samples were collected in spring, 746 were collected in sum-
mer, 696 were collected in fall, and 680 were collected in winter.
Four (10%) of the analytes (RDW, MPV, triglycerides, and phos-
phorus) differed (P < 0.01) between the sexes (Table 1). Male killer
whales
had
higher
RDWs
(mean ± SD:
14.06 ± 0.18
vs
13.30 ± 0.15), MPV (18.33 ± 0.55 vs 15.32 ± 0.53), triglycerides
(149.1 ± 6.7 vs 127.9 ± 5.6), and phosphorus levels (6.00 ± 0.10 vs
5.69 ± 0.08) compared with female killer whales,.
Differences (P < 0.01) were detected among at least some of the
age categories for all 39 analytes (Tables 1 and 2). A progressive
upward or downward trend with age category was detected in 33
(85%) analytes (Table 2). Hb, HCT, RBC, RDW, MPV, BUN, Creat,
TBili,
TProtein,
Albumin,
Globulin,
and
LD
were
progressively
increased with age. MCH, MCHC, Platelet, Retic, WBC, Abs segs,
Abs lymphs, Abs monos, Abs eos, ESR60, glucose, ALP, ALT, AST,
CK, Calcium, Sodium, Potassium, CO2, iron, and FIB decreased pro-
gressively with age (Table 2). The number of differences (P < 0.01)
detected among analytes of adjacent age groups also decreased with
age, with the least differences detected between the adult and aged
groups (17/39, 44%) (Table 2).
Seasonal differences (P < 0.01) were detected for 23 (59%) of
the analytes (Tables 1 and 3–7). Seven (43%) hematology and 16
(70%) serum chemistry values differed between season. No seasonal
differences (P > 0.01) were detected in MCH, MCHC, RDW, platelet
count, MPV, Abs lymphs, Abs monos, Abs eos, ESR 60, TBili, CK, LD,
calcium, potassium, iron, and FIB. When controlling for age groups,
seasonal differences (P > 0.01) were no longer detected in MCV and
globulins in any age group (Tables 3–7). Similarly, when controlling
102 |

 for age group, seasonal differences (P > 0.01) were no longer
detected in the Hb levels of adult and aged whales.
The impact of season on each of the remaining 20 analytes fol-
lowed identical trends in calf, juvenile, early adult, adult, and aged
whales (Tables 3–7). The analytes most often peaked in summer
(N = 8: HCT, RBC, BUN, Creat, cholesterol, triglycerides, ALP, and
chloride), followed by winter (N = 7: Retic, WBC, Abs segs, glucose,
Tprotein, albumin, and CO2), fall (N = 4: ALT, AST, GGT, and sodium)
and spring (N = 1: phosphorus). Conversely, the analytes that least
often dipped in summer (N = 4: glucose, TProtein, albumin, CO2) and
winter (N = 4: HCT, RBC, Creat, chloride), followed by fall (N = 6:
Retic, WBC, Abs segs, triglycerides, ALP, phosphorus) and spring
(N = 6: BUN, Cholesterol, ALT, AST, GGT, sodium). Corresponding
peaks and dips of analytes were more commonly detected during
opposite (N = 14) than during adjacent seasons (N = 6).

DISCUSSION
Of the variables measured, age had the biggest influence on blood
analytes. All 39 blood analytes surveyed in this study were affected
by age. Additionally, season and sex influenced 59% and 10% of the
analytes, respectively. Many, but not all, of these effects on baseline
hematologic and plasma biochemical values had been previously rec-
ognized in other cetacean species.8–21 This report is based on a lar-
ger sample size than any of the previously published reports on
cetacean RIs, and samples were selected using stringent inclusion cri-
teria, which could account for the high analyte percentages recog-
nized as being significantly affected by these variables.
Contrary to previous publications where sex was shown to be a
potentially important influencer of hematologic and biochemical vari-
ables in marine mammals,12,20,21 we detected only four (10%) ana-
lytes (RDW, MPV, triglycerides, and phosphorus) that differed
between male and female killer whales. Male killer whales had higher
(P = 0.015) triglyceride levels than female killer whales, whereas
free‐ranging female dolphins had higher triglyceride levels than male
dolphins.12 The sex differences between RDW, MPV, and phospho-
rus observed in this study have not been reported in other cetacean
studies. Our findings were similar to earlier killer whale studies,
which showed that Hb concentrations, HCTs, RBCs, and WBCs did
not differ between male and female killer whales.23 However, many
sex differences that were previously described in bottlenose dolphins

sium, and iron) and belugas (Hb, RBC, MCV, WBC, Abs segs, ALT,
and potassium) were not recognized in this population of killer
whales.20,21 These sex differences had been partially attributed to
pregnancy or shifts in reproductive hormones.20,21 Since the repro-
ductive status of the female killer whales enrolled in this study was
closely monitored, we were able to exclude samples from females
that were pseudopregnant, pregnant, or in early lactation. These
exclusions appeared to have eliminated sex biases, thereby support-
ing that sex differences observed in previous studies could be attrib-
uted to pregnancy, pseudopregnancy, and early lactation.20,21 Since
we did not eliminate females who were experiencing regular estrous
cycles or males who had seasonal peaks of serum testosterone,29,30
we have also provided evidence that these physiologic events do
not
result
in
hematologic
and
serum
biochemical
differences
between male and female killer whales as has been proposed.20,21
Creatinine levels have been reported to be higher in male dol-
phins and belugas, which was attributed to the increased muscle
mass of male specimens.15,16,19 Male killer whales over 20 years of
age (adult and aged groups) are markedly larger than female killer
whales31and Cornell23 did note a similar increase in creatinine levels
in large adult male killer whales compared with smaller ones.23 How-
ever, in our results, while creatinine differences clearly occurred with
age and season, we did not detect differences between males and
females.
Most analytes (33/39; 85%) showed a progressive upward or
downward trend with age, as would be expected with the true

 physiologic changes associated with aging. The number of differ-
ences detected between analytes decreased as killer whales transi-
tioned between age groups, with the least number of differences
detected between the adult and aged groups, suggesting that the
greatest physiologic changes happen during the years of develop-
ment and growth.
Aging killer whales showed evidence of immune senescence,
rather than a state of chronic inflammation reported in aging dol-
phins.18 While killer whale globulin levels did increase with age,
WBC, Abs segs, Abs lymphs, Abs monos, Abs eos, ESR60, and FIB
decreased progressively. Cornell23 noted a similar decrease in WBCs
with age in killer whales. In humans and other mammals, advanced
age alters both the innate and adaptive immune systems.32,33
Immune senescence starts as the thymus shrinks, eventually resulting
in a decline of naïve T cells. As T‐cell receptor repertoire diversity
narrows and B cell‐induced antibody affinity declines with aging,
lymphoid lineage decreases, and myeloid lineage hematopoietic stem
cells become proportionally more dominant. In addition, many of the
myeloid‐derived, innate effector functions including phagocytosis are
downregulated by aging as well. In humans, immune senescence
leads to both decreased responses to acute infections and poor
development of immunologic memory.32,33 These and other age‐re-
lated changes involving the immune system predispose the elderly to
infectious
diseases,
cardiovascular
diseases,
atherosclerosis,

including metabolic syndrome, and organ failure, such as renal fail-
ure. A review of morbidity and mortality data for killer whales would
be needed to determine whether immune senescence predisposes
killer whales to these syndromes as well.
Red blood cell parameters (Hb, HCT, RBC, and RDW) of killer
whales increased progressively with age. The MCHC value for the
red cells decreased, and while this was. statistically significant, the
difference was subtle and might be physiologically insignificant.
Erythrocyte parameters reflect the capacity to transport oxygen to
ensure metabolic processes, cell survival, and typically increase with
age in fish, birds, turtles, and various other mammals.34–40 Red cell
parameters similarly increased in beluga whales housed at Sea-
World parks.20 The findings in that beluga whale study and the
killer whale findings herein are in contrast with the progressive
anemia that has been reported in aging dolphins18 and a population
of managed beluga whales in Taiwan.21 In humans, anemia in
elderly patients can be divided into three subtypes: anemias with a
nutrient deficiency (eg, folate), anemias without a nutrient defi-
ciency

anemia
of
chronic
inflammation),

 anemias. Anemia of chronic inflammation is the most prevalent
subtype in elderly people, but the increase in chronic inflammation,
which was reported in aging dolphins in one facility,18 was not
detected in these killer whales. Alternatively, the anemia reported
in some aging cetaceans might not be present in the killer whales
of this study, as they were supplemented with a multivitamin con-
taining folate.
Platelet counts decreased in the aging killer whales, while the
MPV progressively increased. Reduced platelet counts have been
reported in some beluga whales.21 Megakaryocytes are the precursor
cells of platelets, and dolphins, unlike most other mammals, have
megakaryocytes in both bone marrow and spleen, a proposed physi-
ologic adaptation of diving mammals.41 Considering dolphins and,
presumably, killer whales have this extra capability for generating
platelets, the decrease in platelet counts might reflect a decrease in
the platelet lifespan.42 Alternatively, the decreased platelet count
could be a function of the previously mentioned immune senes-
cence, as platelets are increasingly recognized as immune sentinels,

 being both modulators and effectors of the immune system.43 The
MPV increased in aging dolphins18 and killer whales. The MPV rep-
resents platelet activity and is most commonly used to discriminate
causes of thrombocytopenia.44 If the platelet count of a killer whale
were to drop below the physiologic ranges established in this study,
along with a rise in the MPV, diseases such as autoimmune throm-
bocytopenic purpura, preeclampsia, disseminated intravascular coag-
ulation, and sepsis would need to be considered.
BUN and creatinine increased progressively with age, as had
been previously reported in killer whales.23 These parameters are
usually interpreted as renal clearance assays. The whales enrolled in
this study were clinically healthy; however, subclinical renal perfu-
sion or clearance might have been decreased in older killer whales.
Alternatively, blood urea is a breakdown product of protein intake,
and increased BUN could reflect a higher food intake by the older
and larger animals. Creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine

 phosphate by creatinine kinase in muscle and is, in healthy animals,
a reflection of muscle mass.45 However, the decrease in creatinine
and, by extrapolation, in muscle mass reported in some other ceta-
cean populations21 does not occur in this population of killer whales.
Therefore, the combined elevation of both BUN and creatinine with
age supports decreasing renal perfusion or clearance in aged killer
whales. Considering that the red blood cell parameters, Hb, HCT,
and RBC, also progressively increased with age, prerenal causes for
decreased renal clearance need to be considered.
The
liver‐associated
analytes,
ALP,
ALT,
AST,
and
GGT,
decreased progressively with age,45 while total bilirubin increased.
AST and ALT are enzymes present in both cytoplasm and mitochon-
dria of liver, heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney cells, but both
enzymes are predominantly found in the liver.1 Bilirubin is typically
interpreted as a hepatic clearance assay. GGT was low in killer whale
calves, peaked in juveniles, and then progressively decreased as the
killer whales aged. GGT is an enzyme found in high concentration in
the liver and kidney, but the GGT enzyme present in the serum is
mainly from the hepatobiliary system.1 The decrease in hepatocellu-
lar enzymes and the concurrent increase in total bilirubin could indi-
cate decreased hepatocellular expression of these enzymes and
decreased liver clearance capability in aging killer whales. Similar
trends were reported in managed and wild beluga whales.13,20,21
However, albumin, which is synthesized by the liver, was higher in
the older killer whales of this study.

Changes in alkaline phosphatase levels can indicate both liver and
bone disorders and bone metabolism since it is primarily present in
these tissues.1 The higher ALP activity and plasma calcium concen-
tration in younger animals are usually attributed to active bone
growth.10,11,15,20,21 Sodium and potassium concentrations decreased
with age, which could imply that changes in the ability of electrolyte
and fluid management exist with maturation.10 Similarly, glucose
levels were higher in younger killer whales as has been previously
reported

managed beluga whales,20,21 but not managed dolphins at one
facility.15
Seasonal variation (23 of 39 analytes) was detected in more ana-
lytes in this population of killer whales than in any of the previous
studies in which the effect of season on blood analytes of cetaceans
was explored.14,19–21 The killer whales in this study were housed at
approximately 14°C and fed a consistent diet year‐round, whereas
free‐ranging killer whales frequently inhabit places with varying tem-
peratures in search of adequate prey resources.46 Some of the
annual circadian patterns, such as food availability, changes in diving
patterns, body condition, and water temperature, to which seasonal
variation was attributed in free‐ranging cetaceans, are eliminated in
this killer whale population. Instead, the high degree of seasonal vari-
ation that we detected with high confidence in the dataset could lar-
gely be due to diffuse seasonal cycling patterns and the seasonality
of sex hormones in killer whales.29,30,47 Alternatively, photoperiods
and subsequent endocrine fluctuations that are not related to repro-
duction, could be the primary drivers. This is supported by the fact
that the seasonal impact followed identical trends in the killer whale
calf group for most analytes in which seasonality was detected,
including sexually immature calves.
The detected seasonal variation in all but one (WBC) of the
blood analytes had previously been recognized in other cetacean
species.14,19–21 Seasonal variation is surprisingly similar between
managed (in this report, and others20,21) and free‐ranging ceta-
ceans.14,19 MCHC was the only analyte with detectable seasonal
variability in all free‐ranging populations only. No seasonal variability
was detected exclusively in managed cetacean populations. Total
protein,14,19–21 HCT, 14,19,20 RBC,14,20,21 creatinine,14,19,20 and chlo-
ride19–21 showed consistent seasonal patterns in managed and free‐
ranging cetaceans. In all of these populations, HCT, RBC, creatinine,
and chloride peaked around the summer months. Erythropoiesis is
known to vary by season48,49 and cetacean erythropoietic activity
peaks in the summer months.14,20 Creatinine levels could be caused
by muscle volume and activity, and dietary protein intake, to a lesser
degree.1 It appears that either muscle mass or metabolism fluctuates
by season, even in populations with a consistent diet, food intake,
and activity level.
Established RIs are important tools used in the care and diagnos-
tics of managed and stranded animals. RIs are also used for popula-
tion health investigations. Wild killer whale populations are exposed
to stressors such as food limitations and the persistent presence of
organochlorines, which are suspected of being immunomodula-
tory.50–52 The availability of established RIs for killer whales and an
understanding of the variables affected by physiologic stimuli will be
necessary for investigations into the impact of these stressors on
killer whales. The subjects in this study were clinically healthy killer
whales, free of parasites, free of immunomodulatory organochlorine
pollutants, and fed a consistent and adequate diet. In addition, sam-
ples were collected without cortisol‐induced artifacts as would be
triggered by the capture of a free‐ranging cetacean. Therefore, it is
expected that free‐ranging killer whale blood analyte levels would
deviate from those reported here.19,20,53 However, the sample num-
bers needed to establish RIs cannot be obtained from free‐ranging
killer whales. This dataset and the trends described herein provide a
unique and invaluable tool for evaluating free‐ranging killer whales,
especially when extrapolated and interpreted by experienced ceta-
cean clinicians.
