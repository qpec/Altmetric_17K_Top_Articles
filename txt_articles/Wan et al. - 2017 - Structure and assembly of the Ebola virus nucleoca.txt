Abstract
Ebola and Marburg viruses are filoviruses: filamentous, enveloped viruses that cause hemorrhagic 
fever1. Filoviruses are within the order Mononegavirales2 which also includes rabies virus, 
measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus. Mononegaviruses have non-segmented, single-
stranded negative-sense RNA genomes that are encapsidated by nucleoprotein (NP) and other viral 
proteins to form a helical nucleocapsid (NC). NC acts as a scaffold for virus assembly and as a 
template for genome transcription and replication. Insights into NP-NP interactions have been 
derived from structural studies of oligomerized, RNA-encapsidating NP3–6 and cryo-electron 
microscopy (cryo-EM) of NC7–12 or NC-like structures11–13. There have been no high-
resolution reconstructions of complete mononegavirus NCs. Here, we have applied cryo-electron 
tomography and subtomogram averaging to determine the structure of Ebola virus NC within 
intact viruses and recombinant NC-like assemblies. These structures reveal the identity and 
arrangement of the NC components, and suggest that the formation of an extended alpha-helix 
from the disordered C-terminal region of NP-core links NP oligomerization, NC condensation, 
RNA encapsidation, and accessory protein recruitment.

 NP 1–450 is an Ebola NP truncation mutant that encapsidates cellular RNA to form 
condensed helices with dimensions similar to those of the inner core of viral NCs11,14,15. 
This truncation removes the 289 C-terminal residues, which contain a long, disordered linker 
and a small C-terminal domain (CTD)16. We recombinantly expressed and purified NP 1–
450 helices (Extended Data Fig. 1), and determined their structure by subtomogram 
averaging (Fig. 1a, Extended Data Table 1, Extended Data Fig. 1) to a resolution of 6.6 Å 
(Extended Data Fig. 2), allowing for clear identification of alpha-helical densities. We 
initially fitted available NP crystal structures17–19 as rigid bodies into the EM density. N- 
and C-terminal regions of NP 1–450 absent in the crystal structures were visible in the EM 
density (Fig. 1b). We modeled these regions and then performed flexible fitting to generate a 
structural model for the helical NP (Fig. 1c, Extended Data Fig. 3, 4, Supplementary Video 
1).
A putative RNA encapsidation cleft is located on the outside of the helix between N- and C-
terminal lobes of NP (Fig. 1d-g, j, k). A continuous density runs along the cleft of each NP; 
we attribute this density to cellular RNA. This density can accommodate 6 nucleotides per 
NP (Extended Data Fig. 3), consistent with previous calculations11. It has been proposed 
that Ebola NP, like other mononegaviruses3–6, encapsidates RNA in the cleft by closing the 
N- and C-terminal lobes17–19. However, our NP 1-450 helices show the two lobes in the 
same “open” conformation of the RNA-free crystal structures17–19 (Fig. 1b, c, Extended 
Data Fig. 3b, 5). Rather than by closing the lobes, the RNA is encapsidated by a C-terminal 
alpha-helix (Fig. 1c, j). This alpha-helix is disordered in solution19, but in the assembled NP 
helix it forms a long, extended alpha-helix that runs up the outside of NP, clamping the 
RNA. The C-terminal, RNA-contacting end of the clamp-helix (residues 398 – 405), is 
highly positively charged (Fig. 1c, j, k, Extended Data Fig. 4, Supplementary Video 1). The 
clamp-helix extends along the penultimate alpha-helix in both the same and the 
neighbouring NP subunit (Fig. 1f, g), forming a “stabilizing ribbon” of stacked alpha-helices 
that run along the NP helix.
NP contains a binding pocket between helices 13 and 15 (Fig. 1i, j) that can bind different 
helical peptides including two from VP3517,19 and one formed by part of the penultimate 
helix of NP core18. In the assembled NP 1-450 helices, we find that this pocket is bound by 
the N-terminal alpha-helix of the adjacent NP subunit (Fig. 1h, i, Supplementary Video 1), 
analogous to interactions seen in other mononegaviruses20. This is consistent with the 
proposal that NP is maintained in a monomeric state by occupation of this pocket by 
VP3517,19 (or by part of the penultimate helix18), until it is displaced by an NP N-terminal 
helix in tandem with RNA encapsidation.
In addition to NP and RNA, assembly of a complete filovirus NC requires co-expression of 
VP35, the filovirus analog of the P protein, a polymerase cofactor found in other 
mononegaviruses, and VP24, which is unique to filoviruses11,15,21. VP35 and VP24 are 
interferon antagonists22–25. We produced NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 virus-like particles 
(VLPs) (Extended Data Fig. 1), and determined the structures of their NCs by subtomogram 
averaging (Fig. 2a,b, Extended Data Fig. 1). The inner NC layer had a resolution of 7.3 Å, 
while the flexible outer layers were resolved to lower resolutions (Extended Data Fig. 2). 
This structure is consistent with previous low-resolution structures of filovirus NCs10,11.

 The NP subunits in the inner layer of the NC have the same structure as those in the NP 1–
450 helices; our model for NP 1–450 fit this layer well as a rigid body (Fig. 2c,d, 
Supplementary Video 1).
The repeating unit of the assembled NC consists of two adjacent copies of NP, one of which 
has a large protrusion of additional density on the outside of the helix (Fig. 2b, purple 
density), while the other has a smaller protrusion of additional density (Fig. 2b, orange 
density). We masked out the densities occupied by NP and RNA, leaving only these outer 
protrusions. We then performed a global fitting search using available crystal structures of 
VP24, the C-terminal domain of VP35, and the small, globular NP CTD (residues 641 – 
739) (Extended Data Fig. 6). We identified VP24 in two positions immediately adjacent to 
NP, one in the small protrusion and one in the large (Fig. 2d, Extended Data Fig. 6). We did 
not identify a unique fit for NP CTD or VP35. The requirement of VP35 for proper NC 
formation, the radial position of VP35 determined by immuno-EM10, and the size of the 
large peripheral density, suggests that VP35 is located within this density.
Unusually, the orientation of VP24 differs in the two outer protrusions. In the small 
protrusion, a face of VP24 including the N-terminus of helix 1, the ends and adjoining loop 
of helix 5 and 6, helix 7, and the N-terminal end of helix 8, binds directly to the N-terminal 
lobe of the NP-core in the vicinity of NP helix 2 (Fig. 2f). In the large protrusion, this face of 
VP24 binds the putative VP35 density, while the base of the VP24 pyramid forms the 
interaction with the NP (Fig. 2e). Helix 6 of NP is poorly ordered in the NP 1-450 helices, 
but appears to be stabilized in the NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLPs (Extended Data Fig. 7).
Contacts between rungs of the helix are formed between the C-terminal helix pair of NP in 
one rung, and helices 3, 4, and the beta-hairpin of the N-terminal domain of NP in the 
adjacent rung (Extended Data Fig. 8). The NP-NP interactions differ in NP 1-450 and NP-
VP24-VP35-VP40 VLPs suggesting that the inter-rung interface “slips” into a different 
preferred position when VP24 and VP35 are bound.
To validate the structural data obtained using virus-like particles, we purified Ebola virus 
and Marburg virus particles (Extended Data Fig. 1), and determined the structures of the 
NCs within intact virus particles by subtomogram averaging (Fig. 3a,d, Extended Data Fig. 
1). We obtained a structure for the Ebola virus NC in which the NP layer was resolved at 9.1 
Å (Fig. 3a-c, Extended Data Fig. 2), and a structure of the Marburg virus NC in which the 
NP layer was resolved at 8.6 Å (Fig. 3d-f, Extended Data Fig. 2). Comparison of the two 
structures with that of the NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLPs show that while the viral particles 
have more variable NC diameters, the structure and arrangements of NP and VP24 are the 
same in all three samples (Fig. 2b,d, 3b,c,e,f). Marburg virus showed an additional, poorly 
ordered density bridging the two VP24 molecules (Fig. 3e).
The two NP-VP24 binding modes generally alternate along the NC helix, but we observe 
positions in NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLPs, Ebola and Marburg viruses, where a single NP 
insertion breaks this pattern (Extended Data Fig. 9). Such single NP molecules often appear 
in several consecutive rungs, creating a short “seam” along the helix. This implies that VP24 
binding is influenced by its neighbours on adjacent rungs. It is unclear why the virus has

 evolved the unusual alternating VP24 binding, but we suggest that the apparent 2:2:1 
NP:VP24:VP35 stoichiometry packages the appropriate amounts of VP24 and VP35 into the 
virus, and may allow for their regulation of replication and antagonization of immune 
responses upon infection of a new cell.
In the absence of both VP24 and VP35, NP-RNA assemblies do not condense unless regions 
downstream of the NP clamp-helix are truncated19. This suggests that these disordered 
regions hinder condensation through steric, entropic, or other effects, and that binding of 
VP24 and VP35 to these disordered regions overcomes this hindrance. Our structure also 
suggests that interactions between VP24/VP35 lobes across rungs of the helix may directly 
promote condensation.
Here we show that in fully assembled NP, the C-terminal helix forms a long, extended alpha-
helix with a positively charged end that clamps the RNA. The extended helix contributes to 
interactions with adjacent NP molecules both along and between helical rungs, while 
positioning the downstream disordered regions in the vicinity of the VP24 binding site. It 
was previously shown that the C-terminal helix of the NP-core is disordered in solution19 
and the first few turns of the helix become ordered upon NP oligomerization in the absence 
of RNA19. We propose a model in which oligomerization of NP, likely by removal of a 
VP35 peptide19 induces partial ordering of the clamp-helix, bringing the C-terminal end of 
the clamp-helix into the vicinity of the RNA-encapsidation cleft, thereby forming a 
metastable positively charged region that promotes RNA encapsidation. RNA encapsidation 
results in stabilization and rigidification of the clamp-helix; the cascade of RNA 
encapsidation and clamp-helix rigidification induces formation of the “stabilizing ribbon” 
and provides a structured interface for inter-rung contacts. In Ebola NP 1–450, this process 
results in condensation; in full length NP, the rigidification of the clamp-helix is likely 
hindered by C-terminal residues of NP, producing a semi-condensed state which then 
recruits VP24 and VP24-VP35 to complete condensation. In this model, the transition of the 
clamp-helix between a short, open, solution form and a long, closed, assembled form 
provides the mechanistic link between oligomerization of NP-RNA, RNA encapsidation, 
condensation of the NP helix, and recruitment of other viral proteins to the NC.
Methods
Cell lines
HEK-293T and VeroE6 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection 
(ATCC). HuH-7 cells were obtained from Japanese Collection of Research Bioresources 
(JCRB). VeroE6 and Huh-7 cell lines were tested for mycoplasma contamination. 
HEK-293T cells are listed in the database of commonly misidentified cell lines maintained 
by the ICLAC, but were used as they are well-established tools for the expression of VLPs: 
the cells themselves are not being studied.
Expression and purification of Ebola NP 1–450 NC-like assemblies
Expression and purification of Ebola NP 1–450 assemblies were performed as previously 
described11. HEK-293T cells were transfected with plasmid and lysed 3 days post-

 transfection in lysis buffer (10 mM Tris·HCl (pH 7.8), 0.15 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% 
Nonidet P-40 and Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche)). Assemblies were purified by a 
discontinuous 25–40% (w/w) CsCl gradient centrifugation at 250,000 × g at 20° C for 1 h. 
The assembly band was pelleted by ultracentrifugation at 200,000 × g at 4° C for 30 min. 
The pellet was resuspended and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) before storage and 
transport at 4° C.
Expression and purification of Ebola NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLPs
HEK-293T cells were transfected with full length NP, VP24, VP35 and VP40 plasmids. 
Supernatant was collected 3 days post-transfection and clarified by centrifugation at 800 × g 
for 10 min at 4° C. Remaining steps were performed at 4° C. VLPs were pelleted through a 
20% (w/v) sucrose cushion in TNE buffer (50 mm Tris–HCl pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm 
EDTA) at 230,000 × g for 3 h, resuspended in TNE and separated on a Nycodenz step 
gradient (2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 30% (v/v)) at 34,400 × g for 15 min. Fractions 
4–6 were collected and checked by negative stain EM; fractions confirmed to contain VLPs 
were pooled and pelleted at 92,000 × g for 2 h. Final pellets were resuspended in TNE.
Preparation of inactivated Ebola and Marburg viruses
Virus specimens were grown, purified, and fixed as previously described10,11. Briefly, 
VeroE6 or Huh-7 cells were infected with EBOV Zaire (strain Mayinga) or MARV, 
respectively. Supernatant was collected 1 day post-infection, and centrifuged at 4° C for 2 h 
at ~77,000 × g through a 20% (w/w) sucrose cushion to purify virus particles. The virus 
pellet was resuspended in PBS (deficient in calcium and magnesium), re-pelleted, and 
inactivated with PFA, (final concentration 4%) in DMEM for 24 h by filling the tube 
completely. The viruses were pelleted and the 4% PFA solution in DMEM (w/v) was 
replaced with a fresh solution of 4% PFA. The sample was removed from the BSL-4 facility 
after an additional 24 h.
Cryo-electron tomography
Degassed C-Flat 2/2-3C grids were glow discharged for 30 s at 20 mA. Virus or VLP 
solution was diluted with 10 nm colloidal gold; 2.5 μl of this mixture was applied to each 
grid and plunge frozen into liquid ethane using a FEI Vitrobot Mark 2. Grids were stored in 
liquid nitrogen until imaging.
Tomographic imaging was performed as described previously26. Imaging was performed on 
a FEI Titan Krios at 300 keV using a Gatan Quantum 967 LS energy filter with a slit width 
of 20 eV and a Gatan K2xp direct detector. Tomograms were acquired from -60° to 60° with 
3° steps using SerialEM27 and a dose-symmetric tilt-scheme28. Images were acquired in 
super-resolution mode.
Frames were aligned with either the K2Align software, which uses the MotionCorr 
algorithm29, or with the frame alignment algorithm built into serialEM; frames were aligned 
and Fourier cropped to 4K x 4K, giving a final pixel size of 1.78 Å/pixel. Defocus for each 
tilt was determined by CTFFIND430. Tilt images were filtered by cumulative electron dose 
using the exposure-dependent attenuation function and critical exposure constants described

 eleswhere26,31. Tilt images were CTF-corrected using ctfphaseflip32 and tomograms were 
reconstructed using weighted back projection in IMOD33. Tomograms with poor fiducial 
alignment were discarded (Extended Data Table 1). Poor fiducial alignment was defined as 
alignment residual above 1 pixel in 2x binned data or retaining fewer than 8 fiducial 
markers. CTF-corrected unbinned tomograms were binned by 2x (3.56 Å/pixel) and 4x (7.12 
Å/pixel) with a Lanczos two-lobe anti-aliasing filter.
Detailed dataset parameters are given in Extended Data Table 1.
Subtomogram averaging
NC and NC-like filaments were previously shown to have multiple helical symmetries that 
sporadically switch along each filament10,11, hindering the use of helical reconstruction 
methods, which depend on data with regular helical symmetry. To address this problem, we 
previously used a combination of subtomogram averaging to determine local symmetries 
and helical-reconstruction for structure determination10,11. Such approaches yielded 
resolutions of 34 and 41 Å for Marburg and Ebola viruses, respectively, which were at the 
time better than subtomogram averaging. Subtomogram averaging makes no use of helical 
symmetry parameters and has recently proven capable of near-atomic resolution structure 
determination26. We therefore elected to apply subtomogram averaging for structure 
determination.
Filaments of interest were identified in 4x-binned tomograms using the Amira visualization 
software (FEI Visualization Sciences group). Using Amira and the electron microscopy 
toolbox34, points along the filament centers were selected. These were used to define the 
filament axes and generate an oversampled cylindrical grid for each NC or NC-like 
assembly; gridpoints that served as initial extraction points for subtomograms are therefore 
arbitrarily positioned relative to underlying NC subunits.
Initial references were generated by subtomogram averaging of single NC filaments using 
4x binned data. Subtomogram averaging was performed using TOM35, AV336, and 
dynamo37, and scripts derived from their functions. Initial Euler angles were derived from 
the cylindrical grid, providing an initial average that was a section of a tube. From there a 6-
dimensional search was performed to refine Euler angles and Cartesian shifts, resulting in a 
low-resolution structure; this reference was used to align the full dataset.
Since NC filaments are polar, relative polarities of each filament with respect to the initial 
reference was determined by performing subtomogram averaging on 30 subtomograms from 
each filament, with and without an extra 180° in-plane rotation. Constrained cross-
correlation (CCC) values of rotated and unrotated subtomograms were compared to 
determine relative polarity.
After determination of relative polarities, 4x binned subtomograms were roughly aligned 
with a low pass filter of ~35 Å. After convergence of subunits, oversampled particles were 
removed using distance thresholding. A lower CCC threshold was set at a value to exclude 
subtomograms that had misaligned to positions away from the helical NC. The datasets were 
then split into “odd and even” sets, and aligned independently from this point on. 
Wan et al.

 Subtomograms were re-extracted with 2x binning and halfsets were aligned independently 
until the 6D search converged. Subtomograms were then extracted from 1x binned data.
Alignment of 1x binned data was performed using a modified wedge mask for the 
calculation of the CCC and subsequent weighted averaging38. Rather than a binary wedge 
mask, the modified wedge masks represents the amplitude of the determined CTF and 
applied exposure filters at each tilt.
The approximate helical symmetries of NCs can be estimated from the subunit positions 
determined by subtomogram averaging. Helical parameters were estimated from lattice 
maps of 10 NCs by measuring the distances between subunits along several helical rungs 
and counting the number of subunits within these distances. Ebola NP 1–450 had an average 
helical pitch of 71±1 Å, with subunits per turn ranging from 25.3 – 28.3 (with integer steps). 
Ebola NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 NC-like structures had an average pitch of 75±3 Å with 12.8 
or 13.8 subunits per turn. Ebola virus NC had an average pitch of 74±1 Å and 11.9 or 12.9 
subunits per turn while Marburg virus NC had an average pitch of 77±1 Å and 14.8 or 15.8 
subunits per turn. It is important to note that helical symmetry is not applied during structure 
determination by subtomogram averaging. The variability of the helical symmetry 
parameters, and the presence of “misincorporated NP” (see below), means that these 
parameters cannot be directly applied for helical reconstruction methods.
Visualization of tomograms and electron density maps were performed with UCSF 
chimera39.
Identification of misincorporated NP
Lattice maps illustrate the positions and orientations of the subtomograms after alignment to 
the reference, and were used to assess the helical symmetry of the NC (Extended Data Fig. 
9). For NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLPs and viral NCs, each subtomogram corresponds to two 
copies of NP and is represented by one cyan arrow. Occasionally positions were identified 
where neighbouring subunits were separated by 1.5 times the expected distance, a “gap”. An 
average inter-subunit vector describing the translation between subunits around a gap was 
determined by averaging 20 vectors from manually picked positions across the dataset. The 
average inter-subunit vector was then used to search the dataset; at each instance of a vector 
match, a position was defined at the midpoint of the vector and an orange arrow was placed 
at this position (Extended Data Fig. 9).
Since lattice maps generated from subtomogram averaging contain a fraction of false 
positive and false negative positions, an exact quantification of the number of 
misincorporated NPs cannot be performed, but based on the results of this search we 
estimate 1.3% of NPs are misincorporated in Ebola virus and 0.6% in Marburg virus. In 
Ebola virus, ~28% of misincorporated NP are part of a “seam”; i.e have a misincorporated 
NP in a neighbouring position on an adjacent rung. For Marburg virus this is ~22%. The 
probabilities for randomly distributed misincorporations to be part of a seam are only ~2.6% 
for Ebola virus and ~1.2% for Marburg virus. The presence of seams indicates that the 
binding mode of VP24 is influenced by its neighbour in the adjacent rung. The binding

 mode of VP24 alternates along the helix, indicating that the binding mode of any one VP24 
molecule is also influenced by the binding mode of its neighbour on the same rung.
Local resolution estimation
Local resolution was determined by calculating local FSCs. Local FSCs were calculated by 
padding the references and calculating mask-corrected FSCs40 in moving windows of 96 
pixels using spherical masks with radial Gaussian mollification of 28 pixels. Windows were 
calculated along a 3D grid with 4 pixel spacing. For each grid point, local FSC plots were 
used for local low pass filtering, figure of merit weighting, and sharpening41.
Resolution was also estimated for each protein layer using three cylindrical FSC masks 
made in the Dynamo software package37 (Extended data Fig. 3). The circular cross section 
of each masks contained a full NC subunit; i.e. two NPs, two VP24s, and the unassigned 
densities. The three masks had varying heights and positions, and were centered on either 
the NP core, VP24 layer, or outer unassigned density layer. The three masks were used on 
each subtomogram average, with the exception of NP 1–450, which was only measured with 
the NP core mask.
Structure modeling and fitting
Chain C of the 4YPI Ebola NP crystal structure was edited in Coot42. Specifically, the last 
two C-terminal helices were moved into the EM densities as rigid bodies. The final C-
terminal helix was extended to fit the length of the tubular density in the EM map through 
the addition of a segment of ideal alpha-helix. The missing N-terminal helix and loop was 
built by first extending the loop from the N-terminal beta-hairpin following the loop density. 
A segment of ideal alpha-helix was then added to fit the tubular density. Models were then 
fit into the 6.6 Å density map of NP1-450 using molecular dynamics flexible fitting43 and 
NAMD44 using explicit solvent.
A 6-nucleotide RNA oligomer from measles virus NC9 (PDB: 4UFT) was fit into the NP 1–
450 density. First, the N-terminal lobe of measles NP-RNA was aligned with the N-terminal 
lobe of our NP model using the matchmaker tool in UCSF chimera39. The measles RNA 
model was then split from the NP and rigid body fitted into the segmented RNA density of 
Ebola NP 1–450. This fitting was also performed for the two adjacent NP subunits in the 
subtomogram average; the distance between the terminal oxygen of one segment and the 
terminal phosphorous of the adjacent segment is ~2.6 Å. This is only ~1 Å longer than a 
standard phosphate bond, and given that this is a rigid body fit, suggests that the density 
corresponds to repeating 6-nucleotide segments. This is in agreement with previous 
estimates11.
Rigid body fitting by global search
The central subunit was segmented from a subtomogram averaging map of NP-VP24-VP35-
VP40. Two copies of our refined NP model were fitted into the model as rigid bodies; 
densities were generated from the PDBs with the Chimera molmap tool39 and subtracted 
from the EM density. The remaining densities (Extended Data Fig. 6) represent the 
protruding outer densities. Crystal structures of VP2445 (PDB: 4M0Q), VP35 C-terminal

 domain24 (PDB: 3FKE), and NP CTD16 (PDB:4QB0) were randomly fitted into the 
remaining densities as rigid bodies, using global search mode of the Chimera fitmap tool39. 
PDBs were placed into the difference map as densities at 8.5 Å resolution, i.e. the local 
resolution of the regions directly next to NP (Extended Data Fig. 2), in 10,000 random 
positions and orientations and locally refined. Final positions were grouped by cross-
correlation and plotted into histograms (Extended Data Fig. 6). For VP24 (Extended Data 
Fig. 6), the histogram showed two high-scoring outliers, indicating unique fits outside of the 
bulk distribution. Visual analysis of these fits showed fitting of secondary structure elements, 
confirming these as correct positions. No high scoring outliers were observed when fitting 
with VP35 or NP-CTD, the best fits were not within the regions directly next to NP, and they 
were not in regions with resolved secondary structural elements.
With the position of VP24 confirmed, densities corresponding to VP24 were subtracted from 
the maps, leaving only the unassigned peripheral densities (Extended Data Fig. 6). VP35 
CTD and NP CTD were fit as before, but with resolution set to 15.2 Å, corresponding to the 
local resolution in this region (Extended Data Fig. 2). At this resolution, fitting is primarily 
driven by the overall molecular envelope of the search model, i.e. size and overall shape. 
While the folded domains of VP35 and NP CTD can both be accommodated in the 
remaining densities, they cannot be conclusively positioned at this resolution.
The smaller of the two unassigned peripheral densities is very weak in the virus NC, 
suggesting that this position is rarely occupied in the virus. Differences in expression level in 
the VLP system may lead to more frequent protein binding at this position.
Our structural data do not reveal the position of the long, disordered linker between the NP

VP35. These residues may partially contribute to the unassigned peripheral densities and/or 
they may have a flexible conformation relative to the NC and therefore not be resolved in the 
structure.

 Extended Data Figure 2. Local resolution maps and FSCs of NC and NC-like assemblies.
In each panel, the small inset shows the full subtomogram averaging structure of part of the 
helix with a central subunit colored. Subtomogram averaging maps are locally filtered and 
sharpened. The isolated central subunits are shown zoomed in. The surface is colored 
according to local resolution in Å, as defined by the colormap on the right. FSC curves are 
calculated using cylindrical masks, with a circular cross section of approximately one viral 
subunit (2 NPs and outer protrusions) and height centered at each protein layer; green is for 
NP core, yellow is for VP24 layer, and red is for outer unassigned density layer. In general,

 Extended Data Figure 9. Lattice map revealing the helical symmetry of Ebola NC.
Cyan arrows denote the positions of one asymmetric unit (two copies of NP, each of which 
has VP24 bound in a different orientation), as determined by subtomogram averaging. 
Orange arrows denote positions where a single NP subunit is present that disrupts the normal 
alternating arrangement of VP24 binding position. Single-NP subunits often appear on 
consecutive rungs along higher-order helical symmetries, forming “seams” along the NC 
helix. This suggests that VP24 binding is not only influenced by the neighbouring subunits 
along the NP helix, but also by neighbouring subunits on adjacent rungs.

 Figure 2. Structure of Ebola NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLPs.
a, The structure of an Ebola NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLP helix, visualized by placing the 
density of a subunit in positions and orientations determined by subtomogram averaging. For 
ease of visualization, adjacent rungs are in dark and light grey; a single subunit is 
highlighted in pink. b, Ebola NP-VP24-VP35-VP40 VLP subunit densities. In blue and cyan 
are NP subunits, in orange is the small outer protrusion and in purple is the large outer 
protrusion. Continuous yellow density is RNA. Densities along the same rung are in dark 
grey, densities from other rungs are transparent. c, Detailed view of the RNA-encapsidation 
region; the outer densities are sliced to reveal the NP-RNA interface. This interface is nearly 
identical to that shown in (Fig. 1d, e). In (d – f), panels show molecular models fitted into 
the EM densities. The two NP models are in blue and cyan while two VP24 models are 
shown in orange and purple; model colors match the density colors in panel (b). Highlighted 
on the EM densities in green is a VP24 surface region including the N-terminal end of 
helix-1, the ends and loop joining helix-5 and -6, helix-7, and the N-terminal end of helix-8. 
In the orange VP24 this region binds NP, in the purple VP24 this region binds VP35. d, Side 
view of an individual asymmetric unit; the density threshold is set to show weaker 
unassigned densities. e, and f, Detailed views of VP24 fits in the large and small outer 
protrusions, respectively (see also Extended Data Fig. 6). Density thresholds are set to show 
helical densities. Scale bars indicate 20 Å. See also Supplementary Video 1.

 Figure 3. Structure of Ebola and Marburg NCs from intact viruses.
a, and d, Visualizations of Ebola and Marburg NC, respectively. Visualizations consists of 
subunit densities positioned using the positions and orientations determined by 
subtomogram averaging. b, and e, Subunit densities of Ebola and Marburg NC, respectively. 
In cyan and blue are NC densities. In orange and purple are the small and large outer 
protrusions, respectively. Green density is extra disordered density in Marburg NC. Grey 
densities show other subunits on the same rung; densities from adjacent rungs are 
transparent. RNA density is in yellow. c, and f, Molecular model fits of NP and VP24 in 
Ebola and Marburg NC subunits, respectively. Model colors correspond with colors in (b 
and e). Scale bars indicate 20 Å.
