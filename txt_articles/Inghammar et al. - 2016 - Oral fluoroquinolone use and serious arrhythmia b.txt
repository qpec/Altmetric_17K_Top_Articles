Oral fluoroquinolone use and serious arrhythmia: 
bi-national cohort study
Malin Inghammar,1 Henrik Svanström,2 Mads Melbye,2 Björn Pasternak,2 Anders Hviid2 
ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To evaluate if oral fluoroquinolone use is associated 
with an increased risk of serious arrhythmia.
Design
Bi-national cohort study, linking register data on filled 
prescriptions, cases of serious arrhythmia, and patient 
characteristics.
setting
Denmark, 1997-2011; Sweden, 2006-13.
PartiCiPants
The study cohort was derived from a source population 
of all Danish and Swedish adults, aged 40 to 79 years. 
909 656 courses of fluoroquinolone use (ciprofloxacin 
82.6%, norfloxacin 12.1%, ofloxacin 3.2%, moxifloxacin 
1.2%, and other fluoroquinolones 0.9%) and 909 656 
courses of penicillin V use, matched 1:1 on propensity 
score, were included.
Main OutCOMe Measure
The main outcome was risk of serious arrhythmia (fatal 
and non-fatal), comparing courses of fluoroquinolone 
use with courses of penicillin V use (an antibiotic with 
no pro-arrhythmic effect). The risk period of interest 
was current use, defined as days 0-7 of treatment. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted according to 
country, sex, age, underlying cardiovascular disease, 
concomitant use of drugs known to increase the risk of 
torsades de pointes, fluoroquinolone type, and levels 
of arrhythmia risk score.
results
144 cases of serious arrhythmia occurred during 
follow-up, 66 among current fluoroquinolone users 
(incidence rate 3.4 per 1000 person years) and 78 
among current penicillin users (4.0 per 1000 person 
years); comparing oral fluoroquinolone treatment with 
penicillin V, the rate ratio was 0.85 (95% confidence 
interval 0.61 to 1.18). Compared with penicillin V, the 
absolute risk difference was −13 (95% confidence 
interval −35 to 16) cases of serious arrhythmia per 
1 000 000 courses of fluoroquinolones. The risk of 
serious arrhythmia was not statistically significantly 
increased in any of the subgroups, including analyses 
by fluoroquinolone type.
COnClusiOns
Contrary to previous reports, oral fluoroquinolone 
treatment was not associated with an increased risk 
of serious arrhythmia in the general adult 
populations of Denmark and Sweden. Given the 
statistical power of the study, even small increases 
in relative and absolute risk could be ruled out. Since 
ciprofloxacin was the most commonly used 
fluoroquinolone in our study, we cannot exclude that 
intraclass differences influence the risk of serious 
arrhythmia associated with other less frequently 
used fluoroquinolones.
Introduction
Fluoroquinolones are a class of antibiotics widely used 
to treat common infections, such as febrile urinary tract 
and lower respiratory tract infections. Although fluoro-
quinolones are generally well tolerated, treatment has 
been associated with prolongation of the QT interval.1 
 
Owing to case reports of a possible association with 
sudden cardiac death, the fluoroquinolones sparfloxa-
cin and grepafloxacin were withdrawn from the market 
in 1999 and 2001, respectively.1 
2  Although this associa-
tion has not been backed up by results from clinical tri-
als due to a lack of the statistical power needed to study 
rare adverse events such as serious arrhythmia,3-8  a few 
observational studies have been published that report 
up to a threefold increased risk associated with fluoro-
quinolones.9-12 However, it cannot be ruled out that the 
observed increased risk was attributable to factors asso-
ciated with the acute infection itself or to confounding 
as a result of poorer baseline health of the fluoroquino-
lone users in these studies.
The fluoroquinolone molecules are blockers of the 
human ether-à-go-go related gene (HERG) that encodes 
the rapid component of the cardiac potassium channel, 
resulting in accumulation of potassium within myo-
cytes. Blocking of HERG can delay repolarisation 
(reflected in prolongation of the QT interval) and give 
rise to torsades de pointes, a potentially lethal arrhyth-
mia.13  However, fluoroquinolones are weak inhibitors 
of the cardiac potassium channel compared with other 
drugs with specific inhibitory mechanisms,1  and the 
association between prolongation of the QT interval 
and torsades de pointes is complex and depends on 
concurrent risk factors—eg, genetic predisposition, 
female sex, age, underlying heart disease, and co-med-
ication with drugs that are known to increase the risk of 
torsades de pointes.14 15 Thus, it remains to be deter-
mined if the risk of prolongation of the QT interval

translates into an increased risk of serious arrhythmia 
in a general clinical setting.
In this large cohort study, we investigated whether 
oral fluoroquinolone use was associated with an 
increased risk of serious arrhythmia. We used a com-
parative study design to minimise confounding by indi-
cation, and used penicillin V (phenoxymethylpenicillin), 
an antibiotic without proarrhythmic effects, as the com-
parator.
Methods
study design
We conducted a bi-national cohort study sourced from 
all Danish and Swedish adults, aged 40 to 79 years, 
from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2011 in Denmark 
and from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2013 in Swe-
den, linking individual data from national healthcare 
registers. We estimated the incidence of serious arrhyth-
mia (fatal and non-fatal) in a historical cohort of oral 
fluoroquinolone users matched on propensity scores to 
penicillin V users.
Data sources
We obtained data on filled prescriptions for oral fluoro-
quinolones (Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) 
code J01MA) and penicillin V (ATC code J01CE02) from 
the national prescription registries in both countries.16 
17 
 
Individual data on records of serious arrhythmia were 
obtained from the respective national patient regis-
tries,18 19  and national registries of causes of death.20 
Individual information on potential confounders—that 
is, demographic characteristics, concomitant drug use, 
healthcare use, and medical history were obtained from 
the national population registries and national patient 
and prescription registries. No values were missing. 
Linking the information from the databases was possi-
ble using national unique personal identification num-
bers, assigned to all Danish and Swedish citizens.
study cohort
We included all filled prescriptions of oral fluoroquino-
lones and penicillin V in adults aged 40-79 years in Den-
mark and Sweden during the study periods. In both 
countries, penicillin V is used in, and is the recom-
mended first line treatment for, upper and lower respi-
ratory tract infections. Fluoroquinolones with an effect 
on Gram positive bacteria, such as ofloxacin, moxiflox-
acin, and levofloxacin, have overlapping indications 
with penicillin V for respiratory tract infections, 
whereas older fluoroquinolones targeting Gram nega-
tive pathogens, such as norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin, 
are mainly used for gastrointestinal and urinary tract 
infections.
Each prescription was considered a separate event, 
and each participant could accordingly contribute mul-
tiple courses of antibiotic use to the study. Overlapping 
of treatment courses was not allowed, with the latest 
course taking precedence for treatment status. We 
excluded courses from people who had been admitted 
to hospital or who had filled any previous antibiotic 
prescription within 45 days before or on the  
prescription 
(index) date. To assure adequate covariate assessment, 
we excluded courses from those with no other prescrip-
tions for any drug in the two years preceding the index 
date. To reduce the potential of confounding we also 
excluded those with end stage non-cardiovascular dis-
ease or substance misuse, who may have had a high 
pretreatment risk of arrhythmia (see supplementary 
appendix for a complete list).
Patient involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research ques-
tion or the outcome measures, nor were they involved in 
developing plans for recruitment, design, or implemen-
tation of the study. No patients were asked to advise on 
interpretation or writing up of results. There are no 
plans to disseminate the results of the research to study 
participants or the relevant patient community.
Propensity score models
Propensity score methods were used to control for 
potential confounders.21  We used logistic regression to 
estimate the individual propensities for fluoroquino-
lone use. The propensity score model included the fol-
lowing predictors as current at the index date: country 
of residence, age, sex, country of birth, region of resi-
dence, calendar period, calendar year, history of car-
diac disease, cerebrovascular disease, venous 
thromboembolism, renal disease, respiratory disease, 
rheumatic disease, alcohol misuse, psychiatric disor-
der, number of hospital admissions and visits to an 
emergency department, number of visits due to cardio-
vascular disease in the past year, a range of concomi-
tantly used drugs, and number of prescriptions 
redeemed in the past year. To account for differences in 
antibiotic prescription between Denmark and Sweden, 
we estimated the propensity scores separately in each 
country. The supplementary appendix provides a com-
plete list of the predictors included in the calculation of 
propensity score. Using the greedy 5->1 digit matching 
algorithm we matched courses of oral fluoroquinolone 
use and penicillin V use 1:1 on the estimated propensity 
score.22 23 To assess the balance achieved by matching 
we estimated standardised differences between groups. 
A characteristic was considered well balanced if the 
standardised difference was below 0.10.
Follow-up and outcome
In the main analysis, follow-up started on the index 
date and ended on the date of serious arrhythmia, hos-
pital admission unrelated to serious arrhythmia, subse-
quent antibiotic prescription, death (non-arrhythmic or 
non-sudden deaths), emigration, age 80 years old, 45 
days after start of treatment, or end of study (31 Decem-
ber 2011 in Denmark or 31 December 2013 in Sweden), 
whichever came first. In the secondary analysis of death 
from other causes (that is, all other causes other than 
the main study outcome of serious arrhythmia), we did 
not consider subsequent antibiotic prescription and 
hospital admission as criteria for censoring.
Follow-up time of was subdivided into three periods: 
current use (0-7 days from index date), indeterminate

use (8-14 days), and past use (15-44 days). The period of 
current use reflects the actual time during treatment 
when an acute toxic mechanism would manifest. The 
period of indeterminate use was included to account for 
the varying length of the standard treatment recommen-
dations for fluoroquinolones (7-14 days) and penicillin V 
(7-10 days). The incidence in periods of past use should 
resemble the background incidence of the outcome. An 
increased risk in this period would reflect a delayed 
toxic mechanism or residual confounding from baseline 
differences in health between treatment groups. We 
assumed that if an acute toxic mechanism were true, it 
would manifest as an increased risk in the period of cur-
rent use and disappear in periods of past use.
The outcome “serious arrhythmia” (fatal or non-fatal) 
was defined as a diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia or 
flutter (international classification of diseases, 10th 
revision (ICD-10) codes: I472, I490, I493), cardiac arrest 
(ICD-10: I460, I461, I469), or sudden death (ICD-10: 
R960, R961) recorded either in the patient registries—
that is, registered during a visit to an emergency ward or 
hospital inpatient admission, or in the cause of death 
registries. In the secondary analyses of fatal events and 
death from other causes, outcomes were based on ICD 
codes recorded in the cause of death registries only.
We estimated mortality from any cause other than 
serious arrhythmia to assess residual confounding, 
since statistically significant differences would indicate 
differences in disease severity or differential health sta-
tus at baseline.
arrhythmia risk score
We used a logistic regression model, including all 
potential confounders as predictors, to estimate a risk 
score for the outcome serious arrhythmia for subgroup 
analysis (see table 1 ), and an indicator variable for the 
treatment received. To calculate the risk score for each 
treatment course we multiplied the regression coeffi-
cients obtained from the logistic regression model by 
the respective covariate value at the time of starting 
treatment for all included factors but the treatment 
indicator variables, which were all set to 0.24 We then 
categorised all courses into three groups according to 
the score’s distribution (in 10ths): low (1-5), moderate 
(6-8), and high (9-10).
statistical analyses
Using Poisson regression, we estimated rate ratios com-
paring the risk of serious arrhythmia (fatal and 
 
non-fatal cases), fatal serious arrhythmia, and death 
due to other causes with oral fluoroquinolones use ver-
sus penicillin V use. We used generalised estimating 
equations to account for the possibility of dependency 
between multiple antibiotic courses in the same indi-
vidual. We calculated the absolute risk difference as 
risk per 1 000 000 treatment courses: (rate 
ratio−1)×crude rate among users of penicillin V.
We also estimated rate ratios in subgroups of partici-
pants classified according to country of residence, age, 
sex, underlying cardiovascular disease, concomitant 
use of drugs known to increase the risk of torsades de 
pointes,15 type of fluoroquinolone, and levels of arrhyth-
mia risk score. Homogeneity of estimates across sub-
groups was assessed using likelihood ratio tests. We also 
performed sensitivity analyses using only the first epi-
sode of antibiotic treatment in each individual. All sta-
tistical tests were two sided, and we considered 95% 
confidence intervals that did not overlap 1.0 and P val-
ues less than 0.05 to be statistically significant. Analyses 
were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Results
Cohort
Figure 1  shows the flow of cohort selection. During the 
study period we identified 2 124 632 courses of oral fluo-
roquinolone use (795 355 in Denmark; 1 329 277 in Swe-
den) and 11 065 195 courses of penicillin V use (7 883 023 
in Denmark; 3 182 172 in Sweden). The inclusion criteria 
were met for 921 728 courses of oral fluoroquinolone use 
(309 995 in Denmark; 611 733 in Sweden) and 7 570 585 
courses of oral penicillin V use (5 385 319 in Denmark; 
2 185 266 in Sweden). After propensity score estimation 
and matching in a 1:1 ratio, the study cohort consisted of 
909 656 courses of oral fluoroquinolones and penicillin 
V use, respectively (309 995 in Denmark; 599 661 in 
 
Sweden). Supplementary tables s4 and s5 show the 
baseline characteristics of the unmatched cohorts. 
Before matching, the group treated with fluoroquinolo-
nes was slightly more likely to have a history of cardio-
vascular, respiratory, and renal disease than the 
penicillin V group. Users of fluoroquinolones were also 
more likely to have a recent history of visits to an emer-
gency department and more likely to have a higher total 
number of prescribed drugs. After matching, however, 
the baseline characteristics were well balanced between 
the matched groups (table 1). Supplementary table s3 
provides the odds ratios for the propensities for fluoro-
quinolone use for all variables.
Most of the treatment courses with oral fluoroquino-
lones were with ciprofloxacin (82.6%), followed by nor-
floxacin (12.1%), ofloxacin (3.2%), moxifloxacin (1.2%), 
and other fluoroquinolones (0.9%).
Main results
A total of 429 cases of serious arrhythmia occurred, 
including144 during the period of current use (66 in flu-
oroquinolone users, 78 in penicillin V users). The inci-
dence rates were 3.4 and 4.0 per 1000 person years, 
respectively, corresponding to a rate ratio of 0.85 (95% 
confidence interval 0.61 to1.18) for oral fluoroquinolo-
nes compared with penicillin V. Supplementary figure 
s7 shows serious arrhythmia incidence rates per day in 
the seven day current use period among fluoroquino-
lone users and penicillin V users. The absolute risk dif-
ference for current fluoroquinolone use compared with 
current penicillin V use, estimated as the number of 
cases of severe arrhythmia per 1 000 000 treatment 
courses, was −13 (95% confidence interval −35 to 16). 
There was no increased risk associated with oral fluoro-
quinolone compared with penicillin V in periods of 
indeterminate use (rate ratio 1.13, 0.71 to 1.78) or past 
use (1.08, 0.83 to 1.42, table 2).

subgroup analyses
Table 3 shows rate ratios of serious arrhythmia for cur-
rent use of oral fluoroquinolones compared with peni-
cillin V according to different subgroups. No statistically 
significant differences in rate ratios were observed 
according to underlying cardiovascular disease (test of 
homogeneity P=0.91), co-treatment with drugs known 
to increase the risk of torsades de pointes (P=0.43), 
country of residence (P=0.42), or sex (P=0.13), or across 
levels of arrhythmia risk score (P=0.66). There was a sig-
nificant difference according to age group (rate ratio 
0.45 (95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.88) among par-
ticipants aged 40-64 years, and 1.07 (0.73 to 1.57) among 
participants aged 65-79 years, P=0.02). The risk associ-
ated with use of ciprofloxacin compared with penicillin 
V was not significantly different from the risk associ-
ated with all other fluoroquinolones combined (P=0.61).
secondary analyses
Sensitivity analyses using only the first antibiotic 
course yielded similar results and did not change the 
conclusions of no observed risk of serious arrhythmia in 
current users of oral fluoroquinolones compared with 
penicillin V (rate ratio 1.02, 95% confidence interval 
0.63 to 1.65). We observed no increased risk when 
restricting the analyses to fatal arrhythmic events only, 
neither in the period of current use (1.07
, 0.54 to 2.12) 
nor in periods of indeterminate or past use. We did not 
observe an increased risk of mortality from any cause 
other than serious arrhythmia (rate ratio for current use 
0.95, 0.83 to 1.09).
discussion
In this large cohort study of a general adult population 
from two countries, comprising more than 900 000 
treatment courses with fluoroquinolones, we did not 
find an increased risk of serious arrhythmia compared 
with use of penicillin V. Given the upper limit of the con-
fidence interval, we could rule out an increased relative 
risk of 18% of serious arrhythmia. Correspondingly, in 
absolute terms, any residual risk would account for at 
most 16 cases per 1 000 000 treatment courses. Reassur-
ingly, our results were homogenous and we did not 
observe increased risks in groups of participants with 
underlying cardiovascular disease or who concurrently 
used drugs that increase the risk of torsades de pointes. 
The relative risk in the younger age group was signifi-
cantly lower; however, since the rate of serious arrhyth-
mia was markedly lower with lower age, the analysis 
was based on few events in the younger subgroup.
strengths and limitations of this study
Our study has several strengths. Firstly, the use of 
nationwide cohorts from two different countries assures 
that our results are generalisable to a general adult pop-
ulation. Secondly, we used multiple strategies to reduce 
confounding. We used propensity score methods to bal-
ance the treatment groups on a large range of baseline

health factors. Additionally, we excluded participants 
with end stage serious disease or substance misuse to 
reduce the numbers of people at high risk irrespective 
of fluoroquinolone use. We also excluded those with 
previous antibiotic prescriptions or hospital admis-
sions, and censored those with subsequent antibiotic 
prescriptions or hospital admissions to minimise mis-
classification of drug use. Finally, we utilised a compar-
ative design with a reference antibiotic without 
pro-arrhythmic effect, to minimise confounding by 
indication.
A limitation of the study is the lack of information on 
the actual duration of treatment. This was accounted 
for by inclusion of the risk period of indeterminate use. 
Another limitation is the lack of information on the 
indication for treatment, as well as information on 
other important risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia 
(eg, electrolyte disturbances and degree of organic 
heart disease), therefore residual confounding cannot 
be ruled out despite multiple measures to minimise 
confounding. However, the robustness of our results is 
supported by the fact that the rates of serious arrhyth-
mia were not significantly different in fluoroquinolone 
and penicillin V users in the period of past use, which 
was considered to mirror the baseline risk of serious 
arrhythmia.
The comparator antibiotic penicillin V, the most com-
monly used antibiotic in both Denmark and Sweden, 
has no known pro-arrhythmic effect. Indications 
 
overlap for the fluoroquinolones with effect on Gram 
positive bacteria, such as ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and 
 
levofloxacin, with regard to respiratory infections, but 
older fluoroquinolones such as norfloxacin and ciproflox-
acin, with predominate effect on Gram negative patho-
gens, are mainly used in gastrointestinal and urinary tract 
infections. However, even though the indications for 
treatment (type of the acute infection) did not overlap per-
fectly, the mortality due to other causes did not differ 
between fluoroquinolone and penicillin V users in our 
study. This indicates an equal degree of severity of the 
acute infections for which the treatment were prescribed, 
as well as similar heath status at baseline. We therefore 
believe penicillin V is a valid comparator.
The outcome “serious arrhythmia” as defined in the 
current study, has not been formally validated. How-
ever, in previous studies of myocardial infarction, car-
diac death, and atrial fibrillation, 86-97% of diagnoses 
from the Danish patient register and causes of death 
register, were correct according to the original medical 
or autopsy files25-27 ; similarly, in Sweden validation 
studies suggests that 90-100% of these diagnoses are 
correct.19 
28
Non-fatal ventricular arrhythmia is likely to be 
underdiagnosed,1 and misclassification could be differ-
ential (higher ascertainment in fluoroquinolone users) 
owing to a presumed increased risk of QT prolongation. 
If present, this bias would inflate estimates, while our 
finding of no association would still hold true.
Comparison with other studies
Despite the potential for prolongation of the QT interval 
during fluoroquinolone treatment, few studies have

explored the association with arrhythmia in a larger 
clinical setting. A case-control study from Italy reported 
a fourfold increased risk of serious arrhythmia within 
four weeks of fluoroquinolone use.10  A nested case-con-
trol study from Canada reported a twofold increased 
risk within two weeks of fluoroquinolone use.9 Both of 
these studies, however, assessed the risk associated 
with fluoroquinolone use compared with no use of anti-
biotics. Consequently, it cannot be ruled out that the 
reported increased risks were attributable to the indica-
tion for treatment—that is, the acute infections. An 
acute infection can facilitate arrhythmia, cardiac arrest, 
and sudden death through a wide range of mecha-
nisms, such as hypovolaemia, disturbance of electro-
lytes, acute kidney failure, and aggravated heart 
failure.29
In a cohort study of US veterans, a 2.5-fold increased 
risk of serious arrhythmia was reported among users of 
levofloxacin compared with amoxicillin. Notably, how-
ever, a 2.5-fold increased risk of all cause mortality was 
also observed with levofloxacin. This noticeable differ-
ence in all cause mortality implies important differ-
ences in health status between those treated with 
fluoroquinolones and those treated with amoxicillin, 
which may also have confounded the estimate for seri-
ous arrhythmia.12  In line with our findings, although 
using a broader outcome definition, no significantly 
increased risk of cardiovascular death associated with 
ciprofloxacin compared with amoxicillin was observed 
in a cohort study of Medicaid beneficiaries. However, in 
this study, the hazard ratio for cardiovascular death 
associated with levofloxacin was 1.50 (95% confidence 
interval 0.82 to 2.72).30
Recently, a cohort study from Taiwan reported a 
threefold significantly increased odds ratio for ventric-
ular arrhythmia and cardiovascular death with use of 
moxifloxacin, but not ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin, 
compared with amoxicillin-clavulanate.11 The observed 
association with use of moxifloxacin, however, per-
sisted in periods of up to 30 days after the start of treat-
ment, which implies that factors other than treatment 
itself, such as baseline health of the participants or the 
severity of infection, may have influenced the results. 
All cause mortality and other causes of mortality were 
not reported.
Experimental studies and small trials in humans 
suggest that the potential for cardiac potassium chan-
nel inhibition may differ slightly between the various 
fluoroquinolone agents; eg, moxifloxacin has been 
associated with a slightly greater effect on prolonga-
tion of the QT interval.3 5 13  However, results are some-
what conflicting and it is not established whether these 
differences translate to differential risks of serious 
arrhythmia in a real world clinical setting.14  Additional 
pro-arrhythmic mechanisms have been described for 
fluoroquinolones, such as triangulation of the action 
potential and dispersion of repolarisation.31  Among 
low potency blockers of the cardiac potassium channel 
such as fluoroquinolones, QT studies may not be pre-
cise enough to predict any differences in pro-arrhyth-
mogenic potential between agents, and other factors 
that alter drug  
concentrations, such as impaired drug 
clearance, may be more important than specific drug 
related risk factors.32
The effect on cardiac rhythm of levofloxacin and 
moxifloxacin was assessed in a randomised clinical 
study of patients aged 65 years or more with pneumo-
nia. The authors found no correlation between prolon-
gation of the QT interval and cardiac events and no 
significant difference between the two treatment arms.33 
Most treatment courses with fluoroquinolones in our 
study were with ciprofloxacin, thus our results are pri-
marily applicable to this fluoroquinolone. We did not 
find statistical evidence of heterogeneity between cipro-
floxacin and other fluoroquinolones, but we cannot 
exclude the possibility that the specific agents in this 
drug class might increase the risk of serious arrhythmia 
differentially.
Conclusions and policy implications
We cannot exclude that in some situations fluoroquino-
lones can cause torsades de pointes. However, we did 
not find support for an increased risk of serious arrhyth-
mia associated with oral fluoroquinolone use in a gen-
eral adult outpatient population. Among those with 
severe infections requiring hospital stay, further 
research is needed to assess the magnitude of the 
pro-arrhythmic potential of fluoroquinolones. Since 
ciprofloxacin was the most commonly used fluoro-
quinolone in our study we cannot exclude that intra-
class differences influence the risk of serious 
arrhythmias associated with other fluoroquinolones.
