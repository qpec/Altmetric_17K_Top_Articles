Abstract
Metagenomic sequence analysis is rapidly becoming the primary source of virus discovery 1–3. A 
substantial majority of the currently available virus genomes comes from metagenomics, and some 
of these represent extremely abundant viruses even if never grown in the laboratory. A particularly 
striking case of a virus discovered via metagenomics is crAssphage, which is by far the most 
abundant human-associated virus known, comprising up to 90% of the sequences in the gut 
virome 4. Over 80% of the predicted proteins encoded in the approximately 100 kilobase 
crAssphage genome showed no significant similarity to available protein sequences, precluding 
classification of this virus and hampering further study. Here we combine comprehensive search of 
genomic and metagenomic databases with sensitive methods for protein sequence analysis to 
identify an expansive, diverse group of bacteriophages related to crAssphage and predict the 
functions of the majority of phage proteins, in particular, those that comprise the structural, 
replication and expression modules. Most if not all of the crAss-like phages appear to be 
associated with diverse bacteria from the phylum Bacteroidetes, which includes some of the most 
abundant bacteria in the human gut microbiome and are also common in various other habitats. 
These findings provide for experimental characterization of the most abundant but poorly 
understood members of the human-associated virome.
Viruses are the most abundant biological entities on earth: in most environments, from ocean 
water to the content of animal guts, the number of detected virus particles exceeds that of

 cells by one to two orders of magnitude 2. Among these viruses, more than 90% are tailed 
bacteriophages 1. More than 99% of the prokaryotic diversity in the biosphere is represented 
by bacteria and archaea that fail to grow in laboratory cultures, and accordingly, the great 
majority of the viruses are thought to infect these uncultivated microbes 1. Moreover, 
analysis of the human gut virome shows that most of the sequences, in contrast to the 
bacterial and archaeal sequences, have no matches in the current sequence databases, 
suggesting a vast virome consisting primarily of ‘dark matter’ 5–7.
The crAssphage is the utmost manifestation of this trend. The complete crAssphage (after 
Cross Assembly) genome was assembled by joining contigs obtained from several human 
fecal viral metagenomes as a circular double-stranded (ds) DNA molecule of approximately 
97 kilobase (kb)4; the circular genome map apparently results from the terminal redundancy 
and/or circular permutation. The crAssphage is extremely abundant, accounting for up to 
90% of the reads in the virus-like particle-enriched fraction of the gut metagenome and 
about 22% of the reads in the total metagenome. Numerous reads matching the crAssphage 
genome have been identified in numerous gut metagenomes collected in diverse geographic 
locations, indicating that crAssphage is not only the most abundant virus in the human gut 
microbiome but also a (nearly) ubiquitous one 4,8,9. Read co-occurrence analysis points to 
bacteria of the phylum Bacteroidetes as the host(s) of the crAssphage 4,10. This assignment 
is compatible with the presence, in the crAssphage genome, of a protein containing 
carbohydrate-binding domains (BACON domains) that is highly similar to a homologous 
protein from Bacteroides and with partial matches between two crAssphage sequences and 
CRISPR spacers from two species of Bacteroides 4. Members of the Bacteroidetes dominate 
the gut microbiome but most of these bacteria so far have not been grown in culture 11,12. 
Thus, it is hardly surprising that the most abundant – but never isolated – phage from this 
environment appears to be a parasite of Bacteroidetes. Analysis of the protein sequences 
encoded in the crAssphage genome failed to identify specific relationships with other 
bacteriophages 4. Several proteins implicated in phage genome replication have been 
identified including a family B DNA polymerase (DNAP), a primase and a flavin-dependent 
thymidylate synthase, but neither the major capsid protein nor other structural and 
morphogenetic proteins were detected. In an attempt to clarify the provenance of this most 
abundant but enigmatic human-associated virus, we re-analyzed the crAssphage genome 
using the most sensitive available methods for protein sequence analysis and taking 
advantage of the database growth since the time of crAssphage discovery. The result is the 
identification of a previously unknown, expansive bacteriophage family that appears to be 
associated with diverse members of Bacteroidetes and for which we now recognize the 
structural, replication and expression gene modules.
The sequences of the crAssphage proteins were compared, using PSI-BLAST, to the non-
redundant protein sequence database (nr) and the Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) databases 
(NCBI, NIH, Bethesda) containing microbial genomic and metagenomic sequences. 
Sequences with significant similarity to crAssphage proteins were detected in four genomes 
of previously identified bacteriophages and numerous contigs assigned to bacterial genomes 
(possibly, prophages) and metagenomic contigs. These sequences were highly diverse, and 
most were not closely related (despite the statistical significance of the detected similarity) 
to the crAssphage proteins (Supplementary Table 1). Thus, crAssphage relatives identified

 here might comprise a previously unidentified, large, diverse family of bacteriophages 
(henceforth crAss-like family), or potentially, even two or more families. Altogether, we 
identified several hundred putative representatives of the crAss-like phage family 
(Supplementary Figure 1); 37 diverse representatives, for which (nearly) complete genomes 
were available, were selected for in-depth analysis (Supplementary Table 1). We then 
constructed multiple alignments of the crAssphage proteins and their homologs, and used 
these alignments as queries for profile-profile searches against a comprehensive collection of 
protein families using the HHPred software, one of the most sensitive current methods for 
protein sequence analysis (see Methods for details). We identified a block of 5 genes that 
appear to comprise the structural module of the emerging family of bacteriophages. These 
genes encode a predicted major capsid protein (MCP) of the HK97 fold, portal protein, large 
terminase subunit, and two uncharacterized proteins that are conserved throughout the 
crAss-like family and, given the consistent adjacency to the MCP, could be components of 
the virion or the morphogenetic machinery (Table 1; Figure 1; Supplementary Table 2 and 
Supplementary Note 1).
Despite the low sequence conservation, even within the family, and remote similarity to 
proteins from other phages, the gene order in the capsid module of the crAss-like family is 
nearly invariant (Figure 1), suggesting congruent evolution of these genes. A concatenated 
alignment of all 5 genes was used to construct a phylogenetic tree of the crAss-like family 
which includes a strongly supported clade of crAssphage relatives and several other distinct 
groups of (predicted) bacteriophages (Figure 1).. Three of these groups included previously 
identified phages, namely Azobacteroides phage ProJPt-Bp 13, Flavobacterium 
psychrophilum phage Fpv3 and Cellulophaga phage phi14:2, widespread, although 
apparently not highly abundant phages in the oceans 14. The same group that included the 
Cellulophaga phage also contained the genome of the IAS (immunodeficiency-associated 
stool) virus that is highly abundant in gut viromes of HIV-infected individuals15. Most of the 
other members of the crAss-like family are unassigned metagenomic sequences but several 
come from bacterial genome assemblies and might represent prophages. All experimentally 
characterized crAss-like phages are associated with Bacteroidetes. Among the other 
sequences included in the family, several are assigned to other bacteria, in particular, 
Chlamydia trachomatis, as well as several members of the recently identified candidate 
phyla radiation (CPR) 16. However, in the phylogenetic trees of the predicted MCP, these 
sequences are embedded within groups consisting of sequences associated with 
Bacteroidetes (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1), and none of these contigs contained 
genes that could be linked to the host bacteria. Thus, the available data appear compatible 
with exclusive association between the crAss-like phages and Bacteroidetes.
In the linear genome maps shown in Figure 2 (see Supplementary Table 1 and 
Supplementary Note 1 for the crAssphage and IAS phage gene annotations), the capsid 
structural module occupies about 10 kb near one end of the crAss-like phage genomes. 
Downstream of this module, are the genes encoding predicted tail proteins and two proteins 
homologous to bacterial Integration Host Factor (IHF) that is essential for chromatin 
packaging in bacteria and some phages 17 (Figure 2; Table 1; Supplementary Table 2). The 
two most conserved tail proteins encoded by the crAss-like group are homologous to tail 
components gp4 (tubular tail protein) and gp10 (tail stabilization protein) of bacteriophage

 P22 18. In the same putative operon, crAssphage also encodes a homolog of the tail needle 
protein gp26 of phage P22. These three proteins are sufficient for the formation of a short 
tail similar to that of bacteriophage P22 19.The gp10 homologs of crAss-like phages are 
large (>1400 aa), apparently multidomain proteins in which the gp10-homologous region 
accounts only for about 150 aa. The additional domains of this protein could be involved in 
host recognition similarly to the tail spike protein of P22-like phages 20. Some crAss-like 
phages encode additional, auxiliary proteins in the tail module, e.g. an IAS protein 
homologous to the tail-associated lysozyme gp13 of short-tailed phage phi29 21. Thus, the 
crAss-like phages can be predicted to possess short, stubby tails, a hallmark of the family 
Podoviridae. One of the isolated crAss-like phages, Cellulophaga phage phi14:2, is indeed a 
typical podophage 14. Unlike phages with long tails (families Myoviridae and Syphoviridae), 
P22-like phages do not encode maturation proteases 22, consistent with the apparent absence 
of such a protease among gene products of the crAss-like phages. However, in the midst of 
the genes for predicted tail components, some of the crAss-like phages, including the 
crAssphage group, encode a predicted Zn-dependent protease (Figure 2) that might be 
involved in processing of the tail and/or capsid proteins. In crAssphage group genomes, the 
protease gene is embedded within a block of genes encoding putative additional tail 
components which are highly similar to homologs from uncharacterized prophages 
integrated in Bacteroides genomes that are otherwise unrelated to crAss-like phages (Figure 
2; also see Supplementary Table 2). Thus, evolution of the crAssphage group apparently 
involved relatively recent recombination with an unrelated (pro)phage from the same host(s).
The lytic replication module genes occupy about 30 kb on the opposite end of the genome 
from the capsid module and are transcribed towards the middle of genome (Figure 2). This 
module encodes a versatile suite of proteins implicated in DNA replication and repair, and 
shows a patchy gene distribution, without a single universally conserved gene, and a much 
greater variability within the crAss-like family than the structural modules (Table 1; Figure 
3). The most conserved replicative gene is a predicted DnaG family primase; many crAss-
like family members also encode a putative superfamily 2 (SNF2 family) helicase implicated 
in DNA replication (this helicase is inactivated in the crAssphage subfamily as indicated by 
mutiple amino acid replacements in the catalytic sites), an ATP-dependent DNA ligase, a 
uracyl-DNA glycosylase (UDG), a flavin-dependent thymidylate synthase (ThyX), and one 
or two diverged single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSB) (Table 1; Figure 3). The 
crAss-like family viruses encode one of the two distinct DNA polymerases (DNAPs): the 
crAssphage clade has a family B DNAP, whereas the other family members have either a 
family B or a family A DNAP, or no DNAP at all (Table 1; Figure 3). Evolutionary 
reconstruction suggests that the family A DNAP is ancestral in crAss-like phages and was 
lost or replaced with the family B DNAP on several occasions (Supplementary Figure 2). 
The only near universal replicative protein, DNA primase, appears to be monophyletic in the 
crAss-like family and forms a strongly supported clade with the primases of Bacteroidetes 
(Supplementary Figure 2). This is the only conserved crAss-like family gene that shows a 
deep connection to Bacteroidetes, indicating that a founder crAss-like phage acquired this 
gene from a Bacteroidetes host and implying that the virus-host link is evolutionarily 
ancient. An unusual evolutionary connection was detected for the phage ligase: in the 
phylogenetic tree, the crAss-like family ligases clustered with those of eukaryotic giant

 dsDNA viruses suggesting that these viruses acquired the ligase from crAss-like phages 
(Supplementary Figure 2). Portions of the replicative gene block of the IAS virus and its 
closest relatives show high similarity to homologs from putative prophages of Bacteroidetes, 
suggesting another recombination event (Figure 2 and see Supplementary Table 2).
The structural and replicative gene blocks of the crAss-like phages are separated by an array 
of uncharacterized genes that are transcribed in the same direction as the structural genes 
and are universally conserved across the crAss-like family (Figure 2 and Table 1). Several of 
these genes encode giant proteins, up to 6000 amino acids in size. An HHpred search 
initiated with the multiple alignment of the homologs of one of these large proteins 
(crAssphage gene 46 product) identified a small region of similarity with the β′-subunit of 
the bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP), which contained the signature catalytic loop with 
the metal-binding DxDxD motif 23 (Supplementary Figure 3). Detailed sequence analysis 
resulted in the identification of two additional conserved motifs typical of the RNAP β 
subunit 23, suggesting that the two subunits are fused in this protein (Figure 4 and 
Supplementary Figure 3). Although the similarity between these crAss-like family protein 
sequences and the large RNAP subunits was limited, the strict conservation of several 
predicted key motifs that comprise the RNAP catalytic site across the crAss-like family, the 
fusion of the putative homologs of two RNAP subunits in a single large protein compatible 
with the combined lengths of the β and β′ RNAP subunits, and the compatibility of the 
predicted secondary structure elements with the RNAP core structure (Supplementary Figure 
3) strongly suggest that the crAss-like family phages encode an active RNAP.
The putative β–β′ RNAP fusion protein contains another large region of similarity with 
other phages, which in some of them resides in a separate protein (e.g. gene_53 product of 
Azobacteroides phage ProJPt-Bp1; Figure 4). Another protein conserved in most of the 
crAss-like phages (crAssphage gene 47) is typically encoded next to or is fused to the β–β′ 
RNAP (Figure 4). Most likely, all three proteins are functionally linked and form a 
multisubunit RNAP; although no homologs of the gene 47 product were detected, the size 
and association with the RNAP subunits suggest that this could be a highly diverged α 
subunit. In most crAss-like phages that encode fused subunits of the predicted RNAP, a 
putative zincin-like protease domain is encoded in the vicinity, e.g. within the gene 45–46 
fusion product of the crAssphage, whereas most of the phages that encode the RNAP 
subunits in separate genes lack the predicted protease (Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 
3). Thus, the fused RNAP subunits might be cleaved by the Zn-dependent protease to 
produce the mature proteins. Fusions of zincin family proteases are typical of different 
multidomain phage proteins 24, which is compatible with the RNAP cleavage hypothesis. 
Nonetheless, it cannot be ruled out that the fusion protein is the active form of the phage 
RNAP. Only a few groups of phages encode their own multisubunit RNAPs, including 
Lactococcus phage 1706, Rhodococcus phage ReqiPepy6, Bacillus phage SPbeta, Thermus 
phages P74 and P23, and giant phages of Pseudomonas 25–28. In most of these phages, β and 
β′ subunits are fused 25,29, whereas in Pseudomonas group phages, each subunit is split into 
two proteins 28. The phage RNAPs belong to diverged families that can be considered 
signatures of each respective phage group 26,28. The crAss-like family RNAPs are even more 
extremely divergent than those of other phages. To our knowledge, processing of RNAP 
polyproteins by a dedicated protease so far has not been identified in viruses or cellular

 organisms. Phage RNAPs transcribe either early (replicative) 28 or late (structural) 27 genes; 
in the former case, the RNAP presumably is packaged into the virion. We attempted to 
identify promoters of early and late genes of crAss-like phages by searching the sequences 
upstream of the genes for potential conserved nucleotide motif, but no such motifs were 
detected.
The discovery of crAssphage, the most abundant virus in the human gut virome, appeared 
particularly striking because the genome was terra incognita, with few homologs detected in 
other viruses or bacteria, and the virion proteins not identified 4. The present analysis 
changes this by showing that crAssphage belongs to an expansive phage family that is only 
distantly related to other known phages and has unusual predicted features, in particular, a 
previously unknown putative mechanism of RNAP maturation via polyprotein processing. 
The MCP of these phages, a distinct form of the HK97 class of icosahedral capsid 
proteins 30, is now confidently predicted and amenable for experiments aimed at direct 
identification and characterization of the phage. Altogether, homologs with characterized 
functions have been detected for 53% (48 out of 91) of MetaGeneMark-predicted 
crAssphage proteins (compared to 26% in the original analysis and 14% in the current 
RefSeq annotation; Supplementary Table 2).
The crAss-like family includes at least one additional phage, IAS, that can reach high 
abundance in the human gut 15. Generally, the crAss-like family appears to be abundant and 
widespread in diverse habitats, both animal-associated and environmental. Various bacteria 
of the phylum Bacteroidetes appear to be the primary hosts of crAss-like phages as indicated 
by the presence of several genes apparently derived from these bacteria including the DNA 
primase that is ancestral in the family and the BACON domain protein implicated in phage 
adhesion to mucus that could increase the frequency of the encounters with the host 
bacteria 31. This virus-host association is supported by CRISPR spacer analysis; in addition 
to the previously reported imperfect matches to Bacteroides genomes 4, we detected perfect 
matches of crAssphage sequences to two spacers from Porhyromonas sp. (Supplementary 
Note 2). It seems likely that crAssphage has a broad host range among the Bacteroidetes, 
which could contribute to the (near) ubiquity of this phage in humans. For the IAS virus, 
spacers with partial matches were detected in CRISPR arrays of Prevotella (Supplementary 
Note 2), again indicating a Bacteroidetes host. Although some of the crAss-like family 
sequences identified here are assigned to genomes of other bacteria, these assignments could 
be erroneous (see above), suggesting that the crAss-like virus family is Bacteroidetes-
specific. Our results indicate that some of the crAss-like phages are temperate and 
lysogenize their hosts by integrating into their genomes with the aid of phage-encoded 
tyrosine integrases. The temperate life style increases the opportunities for recombination 
with other phages and could account for the \presence of regions with high similarity to 
otherwise unrelated Bacteroidetes prophages.
Our analysis of the predicted tail proteins indicates that the crAss-like phages possess short, 
podovirus-like tails. Thus, under the classical morphology-guided classification scheme, 
these phages would be classified into the family Podoviridae. However, given that phage 
taxonomy is moving towards sequenced-based approaches 32, crAss-like phages are likely to 
become a family within the order Caudovirales. The general lesson from this study is that,

 with the current proliferation of genomic and especially metagenomic sequence databases 
and advances in database search approaches, any discovered abundant virus or microbe is 
likely to become a prototype of a previously undetected, often highly diverse group of 
organisms. Such advanced analyses can guide experimental study of viruses and microbes 
that are currently known only through genomic sequences but could be major players in the 
microbiota.
Methods
The search for crAssphage structural proteins was performed as follows. The sequences of 
the crAssphage proteins were first used as queries in a PSI-BLAST search 33 of the NCBI 
non-redundant (nr) database. Proteins that produced no statistically significant hits to nr 
proteins with predicted functions were considered as candidates for crAssphage structural 
proteins. For each of these proteins, homologs from both nr and and environmental (env_nr) 
protein sequence databases were collected (using PSI-BLAST with default parameters until 
convergence or for 5–6 iterations). The homologs detected in this search were aligned with 
the query crAssphage protein, and the alignments were used as queries for HHPred 34 
searches. Three of these queries produced statistically significant hits to phage structural 
proteins (terminase large subunit, portal, and HK97 family MCP).
The sequences of the predicted crAssphage MCP and its homologs (“initial MCP set”) were 
used as queries for translating blast (TBLASTN) searches against the wgs and nr nucleotide 
databases. Nucleotide sequences of the hits were retrieved and translated in 6 frames, and 
the sequences of the putative MCP homologs were validated by comparison to the initial 
MCP set. The extracted protein sequences of the putative MCP homologs (either complete 
proteins or fragments longer than 150 aa) were clustered with blastclust at 90% identity, 
aligned with MUSCLE 35, and used for the phylogenetic reconstruction shown in 
Supplementary Figure 1.
In addition, other conserved crAssphage proteins were searched against GenBank databases 
by protein blast (BLASTP) and TBLASTN 33. These searches led to the identification of 
several complete and partial crAss-like viral genomes in the nr database as well as several 
hundred crAss-like contigs in the wgs databases (Supplementary Figure 1; see ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/yutinn/crassphage_2017/ for additional data).
For in-depth analysis, 37 representative genomes (contigs) were selected among the crAss-
like family members identified in the nr and wgs databases. In some cases (namely, 
CVNZ01000019ext, CVNZ0100007ext, contig0001, contig0002, and contig0005), 
representative contigs were obtained by additional assembly using the Geneious software. 
The original contigs used for these assemblies are listed in Supplementary Table 1.
All representative genomes were translated using MetaGeneMark 36. The set of open 
reading frames produced by this translation for crAssphage was virtually identical to the 
original set that was produced using the Glimmer software 37; all genes detected by 
MetaGeneMark, for which a function was predicted, were represented also in the original 
Glimmer translation 4 (Supplementary Table 2). Homologous protein sequences were

 aligned using MUSCLE 35. In order to identify putative homologs outside the crAss-like 
family, the alignments of all conserved proteins were used as queries for PSI-BLAST 33 and 
HHPred 34 searches.
The analysis reported here differed from the original analysis of the crAssphage genome in 
the following respects: i) expanded databases of genomic and metagenomics sequences were 
searched, ii) the updated versions of the PSI-BLAST and HHPred software were used, iii) 
multiple alignments of crAssphage proteins and their homologs, rather than individual 
crAssphage protein sequences, were used to initiate the searches. Furthermore, no pre-set 
cut-offs were used in database searches, and all search results and alignments were 
examined individually for conservation of diagnostic sequence motifs. Together, these 
amendments to the sequence analysis protocol yielded substantially enhanced search results.
For phylogenetic reconstruction of crAss-like family MCP, PolA, PolB, primase, and ligase 
(Supplementary Figures 1 and 2), gapped columns (more than 30% of gaps) and columns 
with low information content were removed from the alignments 38; filtered alignments were 
used for tree reconstructions using the FastTree program 39. For the phylogenetic tree shown 
on Figure 1, the alignments of five conserved proteins of the capsid module were 
concatenated and used for phylogenetic analysis with PhyML program (http://www.atgc-
montpellier.fr/phyml-sms/) 40. The best model identified by PhyML was LG +G+I+F (LG 
substitution model, gamma distributed site rates with gamma shape parameter estimated 
from the alignment; fraction of invariable sites estimated from the alignment; and empirical 
equilibrium frequencies).
Search for nucleotide sequence motifs was performed using the MEME 41 and Gibbs 
Centroid Sampler 42 programs.

 Figure 1. Architecture and evolution of the capsid gene module of the crAss-like phage family
The phylogenetic tree was constructed from concatenated multiple alignments of the 5 
proteins of the capsid module. The genomic maps of the capsid gene block are shown for 
each branch. The 5 genes of the capsid module are color-coded, and uncharacterized 
adjacent genes are shown by empty block arrows. The colors of labels and branches indicate 
host or metagenome source: Red, human gut or fecal metagenome; Green, termite gut 
metagenome; Purple, terrestrial/groundwater; Brown, Soda lake (hypersaline brine); 
Turquoise, Marine sediment; Orange, populus root microbiome; Black, Flavobacterium 
psychrophilum 950106-1/1 (fish pathogen). Tree branch colors indicate the DNA 
polymerase family represented in the respective genome (contig): Purple, family B DNAP; 
Red, family A DNAP; Green, no DNAP; Black, unknown (incomplete genomes). Support 
values were obtained using 100 bootstrap replications; values greater than 50% are shown. 
The scale bar represents the number of amino acid substitutions per site. No outgroup was 
included due to the low (or absent) similarity between the crAss-like family protein to 
homologs from other phages.
