S
everal previous reports from not only Western but also 
Asian countries have shown that the omission of break-
fast has been associated with a higher prevalence of obesity,1–3 
hypertension,2,4 dyslipidemia,1,4,5 glucose intolerance,1,2,5–8 
which are well-known risk factors of cardiovascular disease 
(CVD). Therefore, skipping breakfast is expected to increase 
the risk of CVD through impaired health conditions, such as 
hypertension and diabetes mellitus (mediators).
However, no guidelines in the world have to date rec-
ommended adults to eat breakfast everyday to prevent CVD 
because there is not enough evidence to support the beneficial 
effect by eating breakfast on CVD. To the best of our knowl-
edge, only 1 study showed that eating breakfast was associated 
with a lower risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in a cohort 
of male US health professionals,9 and the association between 
breakfast intake and the risk of CVD, including stroke, among 
other races such as Asian populations remains unknown. If 
we also find that eating breakfast is associated with a reduced 
risk of CVD among Asian people, whose eating habits are 
different from those of Western people, the reduced risk of 
CVD associated with breakfast could be caused by not only 
cardiovascular protective diets such as high cereal fiber intake 
at breakfast10 but also the consumption of breakfast itself. As 
a result, it might be well grounded to recommend that people 
worldwide eat breakfast, regardless of its contents.
The objective of this study was to prospectively investi-
gate whether the omission of breakfast is related to increased 
risks of stroke and CHD in general Japanese populations.
Methods
Study Population
The Japan Public Health Center–Based Prospective (JPHC) study is 
an ongoing prospective study comprising a population-based sample 
of 140 420 Japanese adults (68 722 men and 71 698 women) aged 40 
Background and Purpose—The association between breakfast intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease, including 
stroke, among Asian people remains unknown. We sought to prospectively investigate whether the omission of breakfast 
is related to increased risks of stroke and coronary heart disease in general Japanese populations.
Methods—A total of 82 772 participants (38 676 men and 44 096 women) aged 45 to 74 years without histories of 
cardiovascular disease or cancer were followed up from 1995 to 2010. Participants were classified as having breakfast 
0 to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6, or 7 times/wk. The hazard ratios of cardiovascular disease were estimated using Cox proportional 
hazards models.
Results—During the 1 050 030 person-years of follow-up, we documented a total of 4642 incident cases, 3772 strokes (1051 
cerebral hemorrhages, 417 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 2286 cerebral infarctions), and 870 coronary heart disease. 
Multivariable analysis showed that those consuming no breakfast per week compared with those consuming breakfast 
everyday had hazard ratios (95% confidence interval; P for trend) of 1.14 (1.01–1.27; 0.013) for total cardiovascular 
disease, 1.18 (1.04–1.34; 0.007) for total stroke, and 1.36 (1.10–1.70; 0.004) for cerebral hemorrhage. Similar results 
were observed even after exclusion of early cardiovascular events. No significant association between the frequency of 
breakfast intake and the risk of coronary heart disease was observed.
Conclusions—The frequency of breakfast intake was inversely associated with the risk of stroke, especially cerebral 
hemorrhage in Japanese, suggesting that eating breakfast everyday may be beneficial for the prevention of stroke.

to 69 years. However, because participants in Tokyo and Osaka were 
excluded from the study because of unavailable of incidence data, 
only 116 896 subjects were eligible for follow-up (additional details 
are available in the online-only Data Supplement).
The questionnaire on breakfast was added to the second survey 
(1995 [cohort I] and 1998 [cohort II]). Of 116 896 subjects, 3053 sub-
jects were excluded from the present study because they were identi-
fied as having died, moved out of the study area, or been lost at the 
second survey. Therefore, a total of 113 393 patients from the 2 co-
horts were eligible for participation in the present study, and the sec-
ond survey was considered as the baseline for this study. Of 113 393 
participants, 88 981 participants (78%) completed the questionnaires, 
including information on breakfast at the second survey. In addition, 
we excluded 6209 patients who had a history of stroke, myocardial 
infarction, angina pectoris, or cancer at the baseline. Ultimately, a 
total of 82 772 participants (38 676 men and 44 096 women) were in-
cluded in the present study. The institutional human ethics review 
boards of Osaka University and the National Cancer Center approved 
the present study.
Main Exposure: Frequency of Breakfast Intake
Participants were asked to provide information concerning the aver-
age frequency of breakfast consumption as follows: “How often do 
you have breakfast a week? Almost never, 1 to 3 times per month, 1 
to 2, 3 to 4, 5 to 6 times per week, or everyday.” In the current study, 
subjects were classified into the following 4 groups for comparison: 
those who had breakfast 0 to 2 (subjects with almost never, those with 
1–3 times/mo, and those with 1–2 times/wk were combined because 
of the small number of those with 1–3 times/mo or 1–2 times/wk), 
3–4, 5–6, or 7 (those with everyday) times/wk. Those who had break-
fast 7 times/wk were regarded as the reference group.
Potential Confounding Factors
Potential confounding factors included age, sex, body mass index 
(quintile), use of medication for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, 
and diabetes mellitus (yes or no), history of diabetes mellitus (yes 
or no), smoking status (never, ex-smoker, or current smoker), regu-
lar leisure-time sports or physical exercise (<1 or ≥1 time/wk), sleep 
duration (6–8 or either <6 or >8 hours/d),11–13 perceived mental stress 
(low, medium, or high), living alone (yes or no), physical labor (yes 
or no: yes means agriculture, forestry or fishery; no means salaried, 
self-employed, professional, housework, retired, or unemployed), 
and public health center areas, alcohol intake (0, 1–150, 150–300, 
≥301 g/wk), quintiles of total energy intake, vegetables, fruits, fish, 
soy, milk/dairy products, nuts, saturated fatty acids, dietary fiber, and 
sodium. Intakes of these foods and nutrients were adjusted for energy 
intake using the nutrient residual model (additional details are avail-
able in the online-only Data Supplement).14
Confirmation of Stroke and CHD
Strokes or myocardial infarction was confirmed according to the cri-
teria of the National Survey of Stroke15 or the Monitoring Trends and 
Determinants of Cardiovascular Disease project,16 respectively. CHD 
was defined as myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death (ad-
ditional details are available in the online-only Data Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
The person-years of follow-up for each participant were calculated 
from the baseline to the first end point: cardiovascular event, death, 
a move from the community, or the end of the follow-up (2009 for 
cohort I and 2010 for cohort II; additional details are available in the 
online-only Data Supplement). Age, sex-adjusted mean values, and 
prevalence of selected factors were calculated and compared among 
the 4 groups using linear or logistic regression analysis, respectively. 
Hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals for each outcome 
were calculated using Cox proportional hazard models. Because obe-
sity, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus could 
be mediators of the association between breakfast and CVD risk,9 
we did not include body mass index, medication for hypertension, 
hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus, and a history of diabetes 
mellitus in the adjustment. Actual blood pressure or plasma levels of 
cholesterol were only available for 29% of total participants (8598 
men and 15 695 women). SAS version 9.4 software (SAS Institute 
Inc, Cary, NC) was used for statistical analyses. All statistical tests 
were 2 tailed, and P<0.05 were regarded as significant.
Results
Table 1 lists the baseline characteristics according to the fre-
quency of breakfast intake. Age, sex, diet factors, lifestyle 
factors, and potential mediators at baseline were almost all 
significantly correlated with the frequency of breakfast intake.
During the 1 050 030 person-years of follow-up of 82 772 
participants, we documented a total of 4642 incident cases of 
CVD, 3772 strokes, including 1051 cerebral hemorrhages, 
417 subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 2286 cerebral infarctions, 
and 870 CHD (Table 2). A total of 5839 participants (7%) had 
been lost to follow-up for 15 years. Age- and sex-adjusted 
analysis showed that the frequency of breakfast intake was 
inversely associated with risks of total CVD, total stroke, and 
cerebral hemorrhage. Further adjustment for diet factors, life-
style factors, and public health area attenuated the associa-
tions, but the associations remained significant. Finally, those 
who had no breakfast had hazard ratios (95% confidence inter-
val; P for trend) of 1.14 (1.01–1.27; 0.013) for total CVD, 
1.18 (1.04–1.34; 0.007) for total stroke, and 1.36 (1.10–1.70; 
0.004) for cerebral hemorrhage.
We stratified participants by medication use for hyperten-
sion (potential mediator), which is major risk factor for stroke, 
especially cerebral hemorrhage (Table I in the online-only 
Data Supplement). Trends similar to the results in Table 2 
were observed among antihypertensive medication nonusers. 
On the contrary, among antihypertensive medication users, 
the frequency of breakfast intake was associated with risks of 
only total CVD, but not of total stroke or cerebral hemorrhage.
In addition, to examine the potential reverse causation for 
the frequency of breakfast intake and the risk of CVD, we 
repeated our analyses of the associations when early cardio-
vascular events (≤5 years from the baseline) were excluded. 
These associations were similar after the exclusion (Table II 
in the online-only Data Supplement).
Discussion
We observed inverse associations between the frequency of 
breakfast intake and the risks of total CVD, total stroke, and 
cerebral hemorrhage, but not of CHD, in this prospective 
cohort study of Japanese people. To the best of our knowl-
edge, this is the first study to investigate the associations of 
breakfast intake frequency with cardiovascular events that 
include not only CHD but also stroke and its subtypes in an 
Asian population.
The major risk factor of cerebral hemorrhage is hyper-
tension, especially an increase in blood pressure in the morn-
ing (a morning blood pressure surge).17 In the current study, 
those having breakfast everyday were not significantly but 
less likely to have high blood pressure (systolic blood pres-
sure ≥140 or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mm Hg) than 
those skipping breakfast although they were from the sub-
sample. Several previous studies have shown that cerebral

hemorrhage occurs more frequently in the morning than 
during the remainder of the day.18–20 Therefore, it may be 
important to reduce the frequency or duration of high blood 
pressure in the morning to prevent cerebral hemorrhage, and 
eating breakfast everyday might achieve this. Witbracht et 
al21 suggested that skipping breakfast was associated with 
stress-independent overactivity in the hypothalamic–pitu-
itary–adrenal axis because of a longer period of fasting, 
leading to elevated blood pressure in the morning. In addi-
tion, Ahuja et al22 reported that men and women aged 21–80 
years old showed a rapid decrease in systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure after having breakfast in a randomized cross-
over design. Other than these 2 studies, there are several 
previous reports on a blood pressure reduction by breakfast 
intake.23–25 This effect of breakfast intake on blood pressure 
in the morning might be one of the mechanisms of the result 
from the present study.
Because we considered hypertension as a major media-
tor between breakfast intake and stroke, especially cerebral 
hemorrhage, we conducted further analyses after stratification 
by medication use of hypertension. We found the associations 
among antihypertensive medication nonusers similar to those 
among total participants. Even if those having no breakfast 
were not diagnosed with hypertension at baseline, they might 
have developed hypertension through skipping breakfast dur-
ing the follow-up. In addition, breakfast skippers who had 
mild hypertension but did not clinically need to take medi-
cation at baseline might have had a morning blood pressure 
surge. In contrast, among antihypertensive medication users, 
those skipping breakfast had higher risk of total CVD, but not 
of cerebral hemorrhage. This result suggests beneficial effects 
of having breakfast on health condition (body weight, lipid 
metabolism, etc) other than blood pressure.
Although the previous study showed the significant associ-
ation between the frequency of breakfast and the risk of CHD,9 
our study did not. In Japan, historically, the prevalence of CHD 
has been lower than in Western countries because of the lower 
prevalence of hypercholesterolemia,26 and on the contrary, the 
prevalence of stroke, especially cerebral hemorrhage, has been 
higher because of the higher prevalence of hypertension.27,28 In 
the current study, we also observed the small number of CHD 
incidence when compared with the previous study,9 and as a 
result the statistical power was low. We did not find the sig-
nificant association between the frequency of breakfast intake 
and the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage probably because of 
the low statistical power, either. On the contrary, although a 
large number of incident cases of cerebral infarction were doc-
umented, the frequency of breakfast intake was not inversely 
associated with the risk of cerebral infarction. Metoki et al17 
reported that the morning pressure surge was associated with 
the risk of cerebral hemorrhage, which was not associated with 
the risk of cerebral infarction. Therefore, to reduce the risk of 
the morning pressure surge by eating breakfast might not lead 
to the prevention of cerebral infarction.
Elevated risks of CVD could make it difficult for people 
to have breakfast (reverse causation). For example, hyper-
tensive people often have hypertension-attributed symptoms 
such as headache and dizziness in the morning.29 In the cur-
rent study, however, the analyses with the early cardiovascular 
events excluded did not substantially change the associations 
of breakfast intake frequency with the risk of total CVD, total 
stroke, and cerebral hemorrhage.
In the current study, the frequency of breakfast intake was 
inversely associated with the prevalence of participants with 
body mass index ≥25 kg/m2, whereas it was positively associ-
ated with the prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Although these 
associations seem incompatible, our baseline survey might 
reflect that after breakfast skippers were diagnosed with diabe-
tes mellitus, they might have changed their unhealthy lifestyle, 
leading to loss of body weight, and started to eat breakfast to 
take medicines for diabetes mellitus before the baseline survey.
The strengths of our study include its prospective design, 
the long follow-up duration, its inclusion of a large sample

from the general population, a variety of end points including 
stroke subtypes, and the high availability of computed tomog-
raphy/magnetic resonance imaging for stroke diagnosis. To 
recommend that people in general should have breakfast, this 
study focused on the general population and yielded results 
that are more relevant than those on occupational or hospi-
tal-based volunteers, who often work night shifts. Finally, 
the detailed information on the frequency of breakfast intake 
enabled us to show that the more often people omit eating 
breakfast, the higher the risk of CVD they would have.
Nonetheless, some limitations do need to be addressed. 
First, the information on the frequency of breakfast intake 
was obtained only at baseline. Therefore, it is possible that 
participants might have changed their eating habits during the 
follow-up. Second, the data on participants’ actual blood pres-
sure or plasma levels of cholesterol were only available for 
29% of total participants. Because high blood pressure is an 
important predictor for cerebral hemorrhage, a further study 
will need to include actual blood pressure for all participants 
to clarify the underlying mechanism. Third, because breakfast 
skippers are likely to lead an unhealthy lifestyle such as smok-
ing4,30 and might have lower intakes of healthy foods such as 
dietary fiber and fruits than breakfast eaters; eating breakfast 
could also be considered as a behavioral marker for healthy 
lifestyle. Although we still observed a significant inverse asso-
ciation between the frequency of breakfast intake and the risk 
of cerebral hemorrhage even after adjusting for various kinds 
of diet and lifestyle factors, we cannot negate the possibility 
of residual confounding or an unmeasured third variable (eg, 
level of education).
In conclusion, we found in a large, prospective cohort study 
of Japanese populations that the frequency of breakfast intake 
was inversely associated with the risk of stroke, especially 
cerebral hemorrhage. Our results suggest that eating breakfast 
everyday may be beneficial for the prevention of stroke.
