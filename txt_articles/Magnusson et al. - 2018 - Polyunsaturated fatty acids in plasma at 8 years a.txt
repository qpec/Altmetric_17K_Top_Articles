Background: Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are
hypothesized to modulate the risk of allergic disease. However,
evidence from previous studies is inconclusive, and limited
longitudinal data exist using circulating biomarkers of PUFA
intake and metabolism.
Objective: We aimed to investigate associations between n-3 and
n-6 PUFAs at age 8 years and asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen
sensitization at age 16 years.
Methods: Proportions of n-3 PUFAs (very long-chain n-3 [VLC
n-3; sum of eicosapentaenoic acid, docosapentaenoic acid, and
docosahexaenoicacid]anda-linolenicacid)andn-6PUFAs(linoleic
acid and arachidonic acid [AA]) in blood samples at age 8 years
were measured for 940 children from the prospective Swedish birth
cohort BAMSE (Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm,
Epidemiology). Allergic disease phenotypes were defined by using
questionnaires and IgE measures at the ages of 8 and 16 years.
Logistic regression was used to examine potential associations.
Results: A higher proportion of total VLC n-3 PUFAs in plasma
at age 8 years was associated with a reduced risk of prevalent
asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitization at age 16 years
and with incidence of asthma between 8 and 16 years (adjusted
odds ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.94). AA was associated with a
reduced risk of asthma, aeroallergen sensitization, and allergic
rhinitis. The findings were most evident for allergic phenotypes
of asthma and rhinitis. Additionally, AA was associated with an
increased probability of asthma and rhinitis remission between
8 and 16 years of age.
Conclusion: Higher proportions of certain VLC n-3 and very
long-chain n-6 PUFAs in plasma phospholipids at age 8 years
were associated with a reduced risk of allergic disease at age
16 years. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2018;142:510-6.)

Allergic disease, including the entities asthma and rhinitis, is
one of the most common types of noncommunicable diseases in
childhood, and the occurrence is also high in adolescence.1,2
Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), which are found in, for
example, nuts, oily fish, and vegetable oils, are hypothesized to
influence the inflammatory response and could thereby modulate
the risk of allergic disease.3
When the hypothesis about PUFAs and allergic disease was
first launched in the 1990s, 2 main groups of PUFAs (n-3 and n-6)
were attributed opposite roles in inflammation: very long-chain
n-3 (VLC n-3) to decrease inflammation and n-6 to promote
inflammation through the actions of arachidonic acid (AA;
20:4n-6).3 However, the actions of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs on
inflammation have been shown to be more complex, with many
different mechanisms involved.4-6
Recently, we reported that dietary intake of oily fish and VLC
n-3 in childhood was associated with a reduced risk of rhinitis up
to adolescence.7 For n-6 fatty acids, such as AA, we did not
observe an association. Our study was the first prospective study
to show that dietary fish at school age might affect the risk of
subsequent allergic disease; this finding was in line with most
cross-sectional studies on total or oily fish consumption and
allergic disease in childhood.8-17 The results for n-3 and n-6
consumption have been inconsistent in previous studies, most
of which have been cross-sectional in design.18-22
VLC n-3 fatty acids and AA are present in the diet but can also
be synthesized from the essential fatty acids a-linolenic acid
(ALA; 18:3n-3, which is found in, for example, canola oil) and
linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n-6, which is found in, for example,
sunflower and corn oil), respectively. However, the conversion
rates of VLC n-3 and AA might be low in human subjects.23,24
Among PUFAs measured in plasma lipids or adipose tissue,
LA, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3), and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) are generally good biomarkers of dietary
intake, whereas AA and, to some extent, ALA show weaker
correlations to self-reported dietary intake.25

Blood composition of PUFAs reflects both endogenous
synthetization and dietary intake and thereby might provide a
more accurate assessment of PUFA levels. Most previous studies
on blood proportions of PUFAs and allergic disease have been
cross-sectional and have shown conflicting results.10,12,19,26-29
However, a recent longitudinal study found an inverse association
between blood composition of EPA at preschool age and allergic
disease in children followed up to age 5 years.30
There is a need for longitudinal studies to clarify the role of
different PUFAs for the risk of allergic disease after preschool
ages. Therefore we aimed to investigate whether n-3 and n-6
PUFAs in plasma phospholipids at age 8 years influenced the risk
of asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitization up to age
16 years in a prospective population-based cohort.
METHODS
Study design and study population
This study is based on a Swedish population-based birth cohort, the Children,
Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiology (BAMSE) study. Infants were
enrolled between 1994 and 1996 (n 5 4089).31 Study participants were
followed repeatedly by using questionnaires up to 16 years of age,32 when
76% of the children themselves answered a questionnaire. At ages 4, 8, and
16 years, the participants who answered the respective questionnaires were
invited to a clinical examination and provided blood samples that were stored
at 2808C. At all 3 examinations, IgE antibodies were analyzed with
ImmunoCAP to common aeroallergens by using the Phadiatop mix (cat, dog,
and horsedander; timothy, birch,and mugwort pollen;Cladosporiumherbarum;
and Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Uppsala, Swe-
den). A blood sample with positive Phadiatop results was analyzed further for
allergen-specific IgE antibodies to the allergens listed above and additionally
to Dermatophagoides farinae at age 16 years. A technical cutoff at 0.35 kU/L
wasset, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.At the 8-year examination,
a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was filledout by 2614 children.7 The FFQ
was nutrient calculated and energy adjusted by using the residual method.33
In the present study we included children with baseline information on
relevant confounders (n 5 3998), information on fish and nutrient intake from
the FFQ at age 8 years (n 5 2540), information from the questionnaire and
clinical examination at age 8 years (n 5 1704), and data from the
questionnaire and clinical examination at age 16 years (n 5 999, Fig 1). These
999 children were eligible for analyses of fatty acid proportions in plasma
phospholipids. Because 59 samples contained too little plasma to be analyzed,
the present study consists of 940 children with measured fatty acid
composition. The study was approved by the regional Ethics Committee at
Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.
Measurement of fatty acids in plasma
phospholipids
Blood samples from the 8-year clinical examination were used to quantify
fatty acid proportions in plasma phospholipids by using gas chromatography, as
previously described.34,35 Relative amounts expressed as a percentage of total
fattyacidsinthesampleof15differentfattyacidswereobtained.Forthepurpose
of the current study, we focused on the n-3 fatty acids ALA, EPA, docosapentae-
noic acid (DPA; 22:5n-3), and DHA and the major n-6 fatty acids LA and AA.
Because of high intercorrelation and shared dietary sources, values for EPA,
DPA, and DHA were added together for the total VLC n-3 level.
Definition of allergic disease outcomes
The definitions of asthma and rhinitis were based on parental question-
naires at ages 4 and 8 years, whereas the children’s own reports were used at
age 16 years.
Asthma. Asthma was defined as more than 3 episodes of wheeze in the
last 12 months or at least 1 episode in combination with prescribed inhaled
steroids used occasionally or regularly.36
Rhinitis. Rhinitis was defined as symptoms of hay fever (prolonged
sneezing or a runny or blocked nose without common cold in the last
12 months or after exposure to furred pets, pollens, and/or mites).36

 Aeroallergen sensitization.
Aeroallergen sensitization was
defined as a positive Phadiatop result (IgE >
_ 0.35 kU/L) and at least 1 positive
test result to a specific aeroallergen (IgE >
_ 0.35 k/UL).
Allergic asthma and rhinitis. Allergic asthma and rhinitis were
defined as fulfilling the definition of the specific disease and the definition of
aeroallergen sensitization.
Nonallergic asthma and rhinitis. Nonallergic asthma and
rhinitis were defined as fulfilling the definition of the specific disease but not
the definition of aeroallergen sensitization.
Incidence of disease between ages 8 and 16 years.
Incidence of disease between ages 8 and 16 years was defined as fulfilling the
definition of the specific disease at age 16 years but not at age 4 years, 8 years,
or both.
Remission of disease between ages 8 and 16 years.
Remission of disease between ages 8 and 16 years was defined as fulfilling the
definition of the specific disease at age 8 years but not at age 16 years.
Statistical analyses
A 1-sample t test was used to compare the distribution of background
characteristics
between
the
study
population
and
the
whole
cohort.
Consumption of PUFAs and corresponding food items in the study population
was compared with consumption of PUFAs and food items among all children
with reported intake to investigate possible selection bias. The plasma
proportionsoffattyacids are presentedas medianvalues withinterquartile ranges.
Spearman rank correlation with Bonferroni multiple test correction was used to
check the correlation between the fatty acids. Log transformation of ALA
improved normality, and the transformed variable was used for association ana-
lyses. Associations between continuous fatty acids and asthma, rhinitis, and aero-
allergen sensitization were analyzed with logistic regression by using children
without the specific disease as the reference group. In analyses of remission of
asthma and rhinitis, children with persistent specific disease were the reference
group. Potential nonlinearity was evaluated by using restricted cubic splines
with 4 knots and applying a Wald test. To study associations between fatty acids
and allergic and nonallergic phenotypes, multinomial logistic regression was
used, and children without the allergic disease and without aeroallergen sensitiza-
tion comprised the reference group. All results are presented as odds ratios (ORs)
with 95% CIs. Potential confounding factors tested are described in the Methods
section in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org. No factor
changed the crude OR more than 5%, and therefore we chose to adjust only for
sex and allergic heredity. Differences in fatty acid proportions between categories
of potential confounding factors and disease status at age 8 years were checked
with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Sensitivity analyses included control for
possible disease-related modification of exposure by adjusting for early
symptoms of allergic disease (reported symptoms of wheeze, eczema, or both
during the first 2 years of life) and for symptoms of cow’s milk allergy at ages
1, 2, 4, and 8 years (reported symptoms to milk, such as vomiting/diarrhea,
eczema, swelling of lips/eyes, itchy eyes/stuffy nose, or asthma). Spearman
rank correlations between fatty acid proportions in plasma and fatty acid intake
levels derived from the FFQ at the same age were calculated. P values of less
than .05 were considered statistically significant in all analyses. All analyses
wereexecutedwithStatasoftware(version11.2;StataCorp,CollegeStation,Tex).
RESULTS
The study population (n 5 940) was comparable with the
original cohort apart from a somewhat higher prevalence of white
collar workers (86.8% vs 81.6%) and allergic heredity (33.7% vs
29.7%) and a lower proportion of boys (45.7% vs 50.5%, see
Table E1 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.
org). Estimated consumption of the different PUFAs was similar
between the included children and all children with information
on PUFA intake in the cohort (n 5 2614), as was reported
consumption of the major contributing food items (see Table E2
in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).
The median proportions of fatty acids in plasma as a percentage
of total fat are presented in Table I.37 The proportions of these
fatty acids were comparable in relation to background character-
istics of the study population, with some exceptions. For example,
children with high oily fish intake had the highest proportion of
total VLC n-3 in plasma (median, 3.7% vs 3.3%). In the study
population total VLC n-3 and AA proportions were highly
correlated (spearman r 5 0.80, see Table E3 in this article’s
Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). The correlation
between plasma proportions and reported intake of fatty acids
varied from 0.02 for LA to 0.29 for DHA (see Table E4 in this
article’s
Online
Repository
at
www.jacionline.org).
The
correlation for total VLC n-3 proportion was 0.23 (P < .001),
and the correlation with reported oily fish intake was 0.24
(P < .001). Correlations did not differ between children with or
without allergic disease oraeroallergen sensitization at age 8 years
(see Table E4).
Asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitization were present in 88
(9.4%), 192 (20.5%), and 258 (27.5%) children at age 8 years,
respectively. The prevalence of asthma at 16 years of age (n 5 86
[9.2%]) was similar to the prevalence at age 8 years, whereas both
rhinitis and aeroallergen sensitization were more common at age
16 years (n 5 413 [44.3%] and n 5 419 [44.6%], respectively).
Between ages 8 and 16 years, there were 43, 241, and 158 incident
cases of asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitization, respectively.
Associations with prevalent allergic disease at age
8 years
The total VLC n-3 proportion in plasma phospholipids at age
8 years was inversely associated with asthma (adjusted OR, 0.64;
95% CI, 0.50-0.82), rhinitis (adjusted OR, 0.73; 95% CI,
0.61-0.87), and aeroallergen sensitization (adjusted OR, 0.77;
95% CI, 0.66-0.90) at the same age, whereas no apparent
associations were observed for ALA and LA proportions (see
Table E5 in this article’s Online Repository at www.jacionline.org).
Inverse significant associations were observed between AA
proportions and asthma (adjusted OR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67-0.96),
rhinitis (adjusted OR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.68-0.88), and aeroallergen
sensitization (adjusted OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.68-0.86).
Associations with prevalent and incident allergic
disease at age 16 years
Associations between proportions of the different PUFAs and
prevalent and incident allergic disease at age 16 years are
displayed in Table II. The total VLC n-3 proportion at age 8 years
was inversely associated with prevalent asthma (adjusted OR,
0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.86), rhinitis (adjusted OR, 0.87; 95% CI,
0.77-0.99), and aeroallergen sensitization (adjusted OR, 0.83;
95% CI, 0.73-0.95) at age 16 years. To study incident disease,
we excluded children with the respective disease at ages 4 or
8 years (eg, asthma in analyses of asthma) and observed a similar
OR for incident asthma (adjusted OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.47-0.94).
However, associations for rhinitis and aeroallergen sensitization
were attenuated and became nonsignificant. For ALA, we
observed inverse associations with both prevalent and incident
aeroallergen sensitization at age 16 years (adjusted OR, 0.61
[95% CI, 0.38-0.97] and 0.41 [95% CI, 0.22-0.79], respectively)
but not with asthma or rhinitis. We did not observe any consistent
associations between LA and asthma, rhinitis, or sensitization to

 aeroallergens. In contrast, AA was inversely associated with
prevalent asthma (adjusted OR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.62-0.88) and
aeroallergen
sensitization
(adjusted
OR,
0.85;
95%
CI,
0.76-0.94) at age 16 years. A tendency toward inverse associa-
tions was observed for prevalent rhinitis at age 16 years (adjusted
OR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.84-1.02) and for incident asthma between
ages 8 and 16 years (adjusted OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62-1.01).
We evaluated potential nonlinearity in associations between the
studied PUFAs and allergic diseases. Evidence of a nonlinear
association was shown between AA proportions and prevalent
asthma at age 16 years (Pnonlinearity 5 .0495, Wald test). Fig 2
shows the adjusted association between AA proportions and
prevalent asthma at age 16 years obtained by using a restricted
cubic spline model. The OR decreased with increasing plasma
proportions of AA but seemed to stabilize around the median
proportion of AA.
Associations with phenotypes of asthma and
rhinitis at age 16 years
Analyses of allergic disease phenotypes were limited to total
VLC n-3 and AA proportions. Associations for prevalent
phenotypes of asthma and rhinitis are shown in Fig 3. The total
VLC n-3 proportion was associated with a reduced risk of allergic
asthma (adjusted OR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.38-0.71) but not with
nonallergic asthma (adjusted OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.75-1.88;
Fig 3, A). The ORs for phenotypes of rhinitis were similar, but
only the OR for allergic rhinitis reached statistical significance
(adjusted OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.94). Similarly, AA was
associated with a reduced risk of prevalent allergic asthma
(adjusted OR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.49-0.76) and allergic rhinitis
(adjusted OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.75-0.96) but not with nonallergic
asthma or rhinitis (Fig 3, B).
Sensitivity analyses
Analyses for prevalent outcomes at age 16 years were adjusted
additionally for early symptoms of allergic disease (wheeze,
eczema, or both up to 2 years of age) to assess the possible effect
of disease-related modification of exposure. The additional
adjustment had a marginal effect on the association between total
VLC n-3 proportions and prevalent asthma (adjusted OR, 0.71;
95% CI, 0.55-0.91), rhinitis (adjusted OR, 0.88; 95% CI,
0.77-1.01), and aeroallergen sensitization (adjusted OR, 0.84;
95% CI, 0.74-0.97) but produced slightly wider CIs. The same
was observed for the associations between AA proportions and
asthma (adjusted OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.64-0.92) and aeroallergen
sensitization (adjusted OR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.77-0.95).
Cow’s milk allergy can affect the child’s diet and therefore
possibly the proportions of fatty acids in plasma. Additional
adjustment for symptoms of cow’s milk allergy up to age 8 years
did not substantially change the observed ORs between total VLC
n-3 proportions and prevalent allergic disease at age 16 years
(adjusted OR, 0.68 [95% CI, 0.52-0.90] for asthma, 0.84 [95% CI,
0.73-0.97] for rhinitis, and 0.80 [95% CI, 0.69-0.93] for
aeroallergen sensitization). Similarly, associations for AA
proportions were also unaffected by additional adjustment for
symptoms of cow’s milk allergy (adjusted OR, 0.75 [95% CI,
0.62-0.92] for asthma and 0.82 [95% CI, 0.73-0.91] for
aeroallergen sensitization).
Remission of asthma and rhinitis between ages 8
and 16 years
Among the 88 children classified as having asthma at age
8 years, 51 did not fulfill the definition at age 16 years. Rhinitis
was present among 192 children at age 8 years, and of these
children, 40 did not fulfill the definition at age 16 years. The
association between increasing proportions of total VLC n-3 and
remission of asthma between ages 8 and 16 years was
nonsignificant (adjusted OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.71-1.97), just as
with the association with remission of rhinitis (adjusted OR, 1.35;
95% CI, 0.96-1.91). AA proportions were significantly associated
with an increased probability of remission of asthma (adjusted
OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.05-2.13) and rhinitis (adjusted OR, 1.33;
95% CI, 1.02-1.72).
DISCUSSION
In our longitudinal study of plasma composition of PUFAs in
relation to allergic disease, higher proportions of n-3 and n-6 fatty
acids in plasma phospholipids at age 8 years were inversely
associated with asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitization at
age 16 years. More specifically, the total VLC n-3 (EPA, DPA, and
DHA) proportion was associated with a reduced risk of prevalent
asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitization, as well as with
incident asthma between ages 8 and 16 years. For ALA, we
observed a reduced risk of prevalent and incident aeroallergen
sensitization. In addition, proportions of the n-6 fatty acid AA
were associated with a reduced risk of prevalent asthma and
aeroallergen sensitization and with an increased probability of
remission of asthma and rhinitis between ages 8 and 16 years. The
associations between total VLC n-3 proportions and AA
proportions with asthma and rhinitis were most pronounced for
the allergic phenotypes.
In line with our findings in this study, higher serum proportions
of EPA, DHA, and total VLC n-3 during preschool age were
associated with a reduced risk of subsequent asthma up to age
5 years in a recent longitudinal Finish study.30 However, after
adjustment for cow’s milk allergy, the association for EPA was
the only association that was still significant. Symptoms of
cow’s milk allergy did not affect the results in our study. In
addition, our findings were most pronounced for the allergic

 phenotypes (ie, IgE-associated allergic disease), whereas a
significant association between EPA proportions and nonatopic
asthma was found in the Finish study. These discrepancies might
be explained by the difference in age of the children in the 2
studies as the prevalence of sensitization increases with
increasing age.38
The inverse association between plasma proportions of total
VLC n-3 and subsequent allergic disease observed in our study is
biologically
plausible
and
might
be
mediated
by
the
anti-inflammatory properties of VLC n-3.5,39 These findings are
also in line with our previous study showing that children with
higher intake of VLC n-3 at age 8 years have reduced risk of
rhinitis between ages 8 and 16 years.7 In contrast, AA is thought
of as a mediator of inflammation through its role as a precursor of
proinflammatory eicosanoids, such as prostaglandin D2, which is
involved in determining the immunologic allergic predisposition
to asthma. Nevertheless, the actions of AA has been shown to
be
more
complex;
for
example,
AA-derived
eicosanoid
prostaglandin E2 might be very important in turning off
inflammation.40 In the present study we observed an inverse
association between AA proportions in plasma phospholipids
and allergic disease. In contrast, no association between AA
proportions and subsequent rhinitis was observed in our previous
study of dietary intake, which might be explained by low
consumption of AA.7
A major strength of the present study is the longitudinal design.
We had the opportunity to study the influence of proportions of
different PUFAs in plasma phospholipids in childhood on the risk
of allergic disease up to adolescence. Using plasma PUFAs as
objective biomarkers, we avoided bias from use of self-reported
PUFA intake. We were also able to distinguish between allergic
and nonallergic phenotypes. In addition, we adjusted the analyses
for a wide range of potential confounders (including diet and
overweight), as well as for the influence of disease-related
modification of exposure by early symptoms of wheeze or eczema
and by cow’s milk allergy through childhood.
The study population consisted of 940 children who had data
from several different sources, including plasma proportions and
dietary intake of PUFAs, repeated IgE measurements, and
repeated
questionnaires.
Although
the
study
population
comprises only 23% of the original cohort, selection bias should
be a minor problem because there are only small differences in the
distribution of characteristics among the study population
compared with the total cohort. In addition, the intake of different
PUFAs and corresponding food items was similar between the
included children and all children with information on food intake
in the cohort. We only have PUFA measurements in blood from
school age, and therefore we could not study the persistence of
PUFA proportions from early life until school age. Definitions of
the outcomes were based on parental reporting and self-reporting,
which could lead to some misclassification because subjects
might perceive and recall symptoms differently. Such a bias is
probably nondifferential with regard to the child’s proportions of
fatty acids in plasma and could lead to a dilution of the observed
associations. In analyses of incident asthma, children fulfilling the
definition of asthma at 4 or 8 years were excluded. In sensitivity
analyses we additionally excluded children with wheeze or
eczema up to age 2 years. Despite this, we cannot exclude that
the cases of incident asthma might represent resurgence or
worsening of preexisting conditions rather than new onset of
disease.
Moreover, the blood samples were stored for just over 10 years
before the assessment of fatty acid composition in plasma
phospholipids. However, the samples were stored at 2808C,
and fatty acid composition should be stable.25 Possible degrada-
tion should affect all the samples the same and therefore only
dilute the associations between fatty acid proportions and allergic
disease. Nevertheless, it might explain the moderate correlations
we observed between plasma proportions and fatty acid levels ob-
tained from the FFQ.
Plasma proportions of PUFAs reflect both dietary consumption
and endogenous metabolism, although the synthetization in

 human subjects of the PUFAs included in this study seems to be
low.23,24 Overall, LA, EPA, and DHA have been shown to be good
dietary biomarkers, whereas AA and ALA are weaker biomarkers
of dietary intake.25 Our measured correlation for VLC n-3 is
lower than what has been presented for adults41 but in line with
other studies on children.42 In our study population very few
were supplemented with VLC n-3 fatty acids, and therefore our
results on total VLC n-3 proportions probably reflect dietary
intake to a large extent. Despite this, recommendations of dietary
intake cannot be made solely based on studies of plasma
proportions of PUFAs.
In conclusion, in our study of 940 children from
a
population-based cohort, higher proportions of n-3 and n-6 fatty
acids in plasma from age 8 years were associated with a reduced
risk of asthma, rhinitis, and aeroallergen sensitization at age
16 years. The significant associations were most pronounced for
allergic phenotypes of asthma and rhinitis. Our results add to the
evidence that PUFAs can influence subsequent allergic disease in
childhood.
Clinical implications: Higher plasma proportions of n-3 and n-6
fatty acids at school age were associated with a reduced risk of
subsequent allergic disease in adolescence.
