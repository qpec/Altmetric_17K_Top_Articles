Abstract
Background: Cocoa flavanols may improve cardiometabolic health. Evidence from small short-term randomized clinical
trials (RCTs) remains inconsistent, and large long-term RCTs testing the efficacy of cocoa flavanols are still lacking.
Objective: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to quantify the effect of cocoa flavanol intake on
cardiometabolic biomarkers.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for RCTs that evaluated the effects of cocoa
flavanols on biomarkers relevant to vascular disease pathways among adults. Data were extracted following a
standardized protocol. We used DerSimonian and Laird random-effect models to compute the weighted mean differences
(WMDs) and 95% CIs. We also examined potential modification by intervention duration, design, age, sex, comorbidities,
and the form and amount of cocoa flavanol intake.
Results: We included 19 RCTs that comprised 1131 participants, and the number of studies for a specific biomarker
varied. The amount of cocoa flavanols ranged from 166 to 2110 mg/d, and intervention duration ranged from 2 to 52 wk.
Cocoa flavanol intake significantly improved insulin sensitivity and lipid profile. The WMDs between treatment and
placebo were 20.10 mmol/L (95% CI: 20.16, 20.04 mmol/L) for total triglycerides, 0.06 mmol/L (95% CI: 0.02, 0.09 mmol/L)
for HDL cholesterol, 22.33 mIU/mL (95% CI: 23.47, 21.19 mIU/mL) for fasting insulin, 20.93 (95% CI: 21.31, 20.55) for
the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.05) for the quantitative insulin sensitivity
check index, 2.54 (95% CI: 0.63, 4.44) for the insulin sensitivity index, 20.83 mg/dL (95% CI: 20.88, 20.77 mg/dL) for
C-reactive protein, and 85.6 ng/mL (95% CI: 16.0, 155 ng/mL) for vascular cell adhesion molecule 1. No significant
associations were found for other biomarkers. None of the modifiers seemed to qualitatively modify the effects of cocoa
flavanol intake.
Conclusions: Our study suggests that cocoa flavanol intake has favorable effects on select cardiometabolic biomarkers
among adults. These findings support the need for large long-term RCTs to assess whether cocoa flavanol intake reduces
the risk of diabetes and cardiovascular events.

Introduction
Cardiometabolic diseases are among the leading causes of
morbidity and mortality worldwide (1, 2). In observational
studies, dietary intake of flavanol-rich cocoa products, such as
dark chocolate, has been associated with a reduced risk of
cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease (3),
hypertension (4), metabolic syndrome (5), and diabetes (6). Given
these possible protective effects on cardiometabolic health, cocoa
products may add to the armamentarium of bioactives.
Cocoa products are generally considered a source of dietary
flavanols that may underlie their purported health benefits (5–8),
although their flavanol profile and content vary by cultivars and
fermentation procedures. Evidence from previous meta-analyses
of randomized clinical trials (RCTs)10 suggest that chocolate,
cocoa, or cocoa flavanols may lower blood pressure (9) and
improve cardiometabolic health (10, 11). Unfortunately, the
evidence from RCTs for cocoa flavanols remains limited (10).

 Synthesized evidence from observational studies has also shown
that chocolate consumption may reduce the risk of ischemic
heart disease (12) and stroke (13). Hypothesized mechanisms
that underlie potential associations between cocoa flavanols and
a reduced risk of chronic diseases include improvements in the
lipid profile (14), insulin sensitivity (15, 16), and endothelial
function (17) and the alleviation of systemic inflammation (18),
thrombosis (19, 20), and oxidation (14, 21).
We therefore conducted a meta-analysis of RCTs to assess the
effects of cocoa flavanol intake on a variety of circulating
cardiometabolic biomarkers. We also examined whether the
effects of cocoa flavanols differ by study design, participant age,
sex, intervention duration, existing comorbidities, and the form
and amount of cocoa flavanol intake.
Methods
Data sources and searches. We followed a standardized protocol in
accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses guidelines to conduct this meta-analysis (22). Two
investigators independently conducted literature searches of PubMed,
Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
published from January 1965 (index date) to December 2015 with the
use of terms from Medical Subject Headings, including cacao, cocoa,
chocolate, clinical trial, controlled clinical trial, and RCT. The search was
limited to trials on human participants and articles in English. All relevant
studies and review articles (including meta-analysis) and the reference lists
of the identified articles were checked manually. Any disagreement between
the 2 investigators was resolved by consensus. An institutional review
board review was not applicable because we conducted a systematic review
and meta-analysis, which do not directly involve human subjects.
Study selection. Articles were included if the study was 1) an RCT that
assigned $1 group of participants to cocoa products, chocolate, or cocoa
flavanol supplements and 1 group to placebo and 2) circulating
cardiometabolic biomarkers in blood samples, including plasma, serum,
and whole blood, were measured at baseline and at the end of each
intervention. All abstracts that reported the effects of cocoa flavanols on
cardiometabolic biomarkers were included for screening. Studies were
excluded if 1) the study design was not an RCT or there was no placebo
group; 2) the intervention was not cocoa products, chocolate, or cocoa
flavanol supplements; 3) the biomarker concentrations were monitored
#1 wk after the acute intervention; 4) the amount of cocoa flavanols in
the active intervention was <100 mg/d; 5) the participants were pregnant
women, children, or adolescents; or 6) values of outcome measures at the
end of the trial or changes from baseline were not reported.
In total, 320 articles were retrieved from the literature search, and 6
additional articles were retrieved from cross-reference and expert
sources (Figure 1). We excluded 239 articles after reviewing the titles
and abstracts and 68 more after examining the full text. The final set of
articles for our systematic review and meta-analysis included 1131
participants from 19 unique RCTs.
Data extraction and quality assessment. Data were extracted
according to a pre-established protocol. The following information
was extracted from the included RCTs: general information (first
author�s name, year of publication, title); study characteristics (study
design, eligibility criteria, trial quality, intervention duration, and the
form and amount of cocoa flavanol intake); participant characteristics
(age, proportion of men, race/ethnicity, and comorbidities); and outcome
measures (definition of outcomes, statistical methods, pre- and post-
intervention means and SDs, sample size of each arm, and adverse
events). Methodologic quality was assessed with the use of the Cochrane
Collaboration�s tool for assessing the risk of bias (23) and included
random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of
participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete
outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. For each
trial, the risk of bias was reported as low, unclear, or high. The criteria
used for quality assessment have been described in detail elsewhere (23).
Data synthesis and analysis. Mean changes and SDs of cardiometa-
bolic biomarkers from baseline in the treatment and placebo groups were
used to calculate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% CIs
with the use of the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects models (24).
Between-study heterogeneity was examined with the use of I2 statistics
(25), with an I2 of 25%, 50%, and 75% denoting low, medium, and high
heterogeneity, respectively. Begg�s and Egger�s tests formally tested for
publication bias (26, 27). If there were any evidence of publication bias,
the trim and fill method evaluated its impact (28).
Meta-regressions evaluated the overall impact of the predetermined
potential modifiers, including study design, the form of cocoa flavanol
intake, the amount of cocoa flavanol intake, age, sex, intervention
duration, and existing comorbidity. Cutoffs of 200 and 600 mg/d for the
categorical cocoa flavanol amount tested were selected based on prior
knowledge and what has been used in previous studies. The categorical

 variable for intervention duration was created based on the median
duration of all included RCTs.
P # 0.05 was considered significant except for the tests of publication
bias (P = 0.10) (29). All statistical analyses were performed with Stata
version 13 (StataCorp LP).
Results
Figure 1 shows how the participants from the 19 RCTs were
selected for the meta-analysis. The actual number of studies
synthesized varied across biomarkers. Characteristics of eligible
trials are summarized in Table 1. Among all participants, the
proportion of men ranged from 0% to 100%, with a mean age
of 30–71 y. The amount of cocoa flavanols tested for the RCTs
ranged from 166 to 2110 mg/d, and intervention duration
ranged from 2 to 52 wk. Among the included RCTs, 11 trials
used a crossover design, 8 trials used a placebo-controlled
parallel design, and 13 trials were conducted among participants
with existing comorbidities, including hypertension, coronary
artery
disease,
diabetes,
overweight,
hypercholesterolemia,
metabolic syndrome, or mild cognitive impairment.
Description of study quality. The quality of studies included
was heterogeneous (Figure 2). Random sequence generation and
allocation concealment were reported in 6 trials. Allocation
concealment was also reported in 6 trials. The risk of potential
performance bias was low in 7 trials. Among 6 trials with
available information on whether outcome assessment was
blinded, the risk of detection bias was high in only 1 trial. The
outcome data were incomplete in 2 trials. The risk of another
bias was high in 2 trials because of poor compliance or other
study-specific limitations.

 Lipid and lipoprotein biomarkers. The number of trials
included for each lipid and lipoprotein biomarker is shown
in Table 2. Cocoa flavanol intake significantly lowered TGs
(P < 0.001) and increased HDL cholesterol concentrations
(P < 0.001) compared with placebo (Table 2). The WMDs
were 20.10 mmol/L (95% CI: 20.16, 20.04 mmol/L; I2 = 28%)
for TGs (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 1) and 0.06 mmol/L
(95% CI: 0.02, 0.09 mmol/L; I2 = 71%) for HDL cholesterol
(Table 2, Supplemental Figure 2). The P values of the Egger�s or
Begg�s tests for all lipid biomarkers were >0.10, suggesting that
the small study effects were not significant. After correcting
for multiple comparisons, the associations observed for TGs
and HDL cholesterol remained significant (q = 0.002 and 0.003).
Biomarkers of insulin resistance. Table 2 also shows the
effects of cocoa flavanol intake on insulin resistance. Fasting
insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR were each significantly
lower in the cocoa flavanol groups than the placebo group (each
P < 0.001), whereas the quantitative insulin sensitivity check
index (QUICKI) and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were signif-
icantly improved among the cocoa flavanol groups compared
with placebo (each P = 0.01) (Table 2). The WMDs between the
cocoa flavanol and placebo groups were 22.33 mIU/mL (95%
CI: 23.47, 21.19 mIU/mL; I2 = 66%) for fasting insulin (Table
2, Supplemental Figure 3) and 20.93 (95% CI: 21.31, 20.55;
I2 = 85%) for HOMA-IR (Table 2, Supplemental Figure 4). The
WMD for QUICKI was 0.03 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.05; I2 = 97%),
and the WMD for ISI based on postintervention values was 2.54
(95% CI: 0.63, 4.44; I2 = 86%) (Table 2). There was no evidence
of publication bias from the Egger�s or Begg�s tests (all P > 0.10).
After correcting for multiple comparisons, the associations
observed for insulin (q < 0.001), HOMA-IR (q < 0.001),
QUICKI (q = 0.02), and ISI (q = 0.02) remained significant.
Other biomarkers. The WMDs were 20.22 mg/L (95%
CI: 20.82, 0.38 mg/L; I2 = 77%) for creatinine and 20.64 mg/L
(95% CI: 22.79, 1.50 mg/L; I2 = 0%) for uric acid. Because of
the limited information reported by individual trials, we were
unable to compute WMDs of change scores for other bio-
markers. Therefore, postintervention values and change scores
reported in the original articles were used for those biomarkers.
A significant difference between the cocoa flavanol interven-
tion and placebo groups was found for C-reactive protein
(WMD = 20.83 mg/dL; 95% CI: 20.88, 20.77 mg/dL; P < 0.001;
I2 = 0%) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)
(WMD = 85.6 mg/L; 95% CI: 16.0, 155 mg/L; P = 0.02; I2 = 0%)
(Table 2). After correcting for multiple comparisons, the
associations observed for C-reactive protein (q < 0.001) and
VCAM-1 (q = 0.02) remained significant. With a relatively
limited number of RCTs available, our analyses did not show
any statistically significant overall effects of cocoa flavanols on
biomarkers of oxidative stress.

<200 mg/d was significantly associated with elevated circulating
HDL cholesterol concentrations (WMD = 0.19 mmol/L; 95%
CI: 0.12, 0.26 mmol/L; P < 0.001); cocoa flavanol intake between
$200 and <600 mg/d showed significant beneficial effects on fasting
glucose (WMD = 20.26 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.40, 20.13 mmol/L;
P < 0.001), fasting insulin (WMD = 22.43 mIU/mL; 95%

20.72; 95% CI: 21.15, 20.29; P = 0.001), and HDL cholesterol
(WMD = 0.06 mmol/L; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.09 mmol/L; P = 0.001);
and cocoa flavanol intake $600 mg/d significantly reduced fasting

P = 0.001), and TGs (WMD = 20.09 mmol/L; 95% CI: 20.16,
20.02 mmol/L; P = 0.01) (Table 6).
Discussion
In this systematic review and meta-analysis of 1131 participants
from 19 RCTs, we found that cocoa flavanol intake from cocoa
products, chocolate, or cocoa flavanol supplements significantly
improved biomarkers of lipid metabolism and insulin resistance.
Our meta-analysis of RCTs is among the first to our knowledge
to characterize how cocoa flavanols affect cardiometabolic
biomarkers. We found that cocoa flavanol intake may reduce
dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation,
which are all major subclinical risk factors for cardiometabolic
diseases.
The favorable associations between cocoa flavanols and
cardiometabolic health have been reported in 3 major US
prospective cohort studies: Nurses� Health Study I, Nurses�
Health Study II, and the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study.
Wedick et al. (48) followed >130,000 women and men,
identified 12,611 incident type 2 diabetes cases, and reported a
modestly reduced risk in type 2 diabetes of similar magnitude
across quintiles 2–5 of flavanol intake compared with the lowest
quintile (pooled HRs: 0.92, 0.91, 0.94, and 0.91, respectively).
Similar findings were also reported in the European Prospective
Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study (49, 50). How-
ever, these findings were not confirmed in a study of 35,816
postmenopausal women (51).
Flavanols have been shown to inhibit glucosidase and glucose
absorption from the intestine, protect pancreatic b cells, increase
insulin secretion, activate insulin receptors and glucose uptake in
insulin-sensitive tissues, and modulate intracellular signaling
pathways and genes involved in gluconeogenesis and glycogen-
esis (15, 52). Flavanols may also improve insulin sensitivity by
increasing NO bioavailability and inhibiting production of
reactive oxygen species and nitrogen species (5, 6). The
increased bioavailability of NO may also mediate the beneficial
effects of cocoa flavanols on endothelial function (53). Exper-
imental studies have shown that cocoa supplementation slowed
body weight gain, increased plasma concentrations of adipo-
nectin, and attenuated insulin resistance, as indicated by
improved HOMA-IR (54, 55). In addition, a growing body of
evidence derived from both in vitro studies and animal studies
also demonstrates the antidyslipidemia and anti-inflammation
effects of cocoa and cocoa flavanols (14, 56, 57) (58–60).
However, evidence from humans is restricted to observational
studies and smaller short-term trials. Only a few studies to our
knowledge have synthesized the evidence for the effects of cocoa
flavanol intake on specific biological parameters beyond those
characterized by excess oxidative stress.
Previous reviews and meta-analyses have supported the
notion that chocolate, cocoa products, and cocoa flavanol

 supplements may improve cardiometabolic health (10–13, 61,
62). A recent systematic review suggests beneficial effects of food
sources of flavan-3-ols (green tea and cocoa) on cardiovascular
health (57). Ding et al. (12) reported in a systematic review of
observational studies that cocoa consumption may reduce
ischemic heart disease mortality. In a meta-analysis of prospec-
tive cohorts of men, Larsson et al. (62) found that chocolate
consumption was associated with a lower risk of stroke
(RR = 0.83 comparing the highest and the lowest quartile of
chocolate consumption). For intermediate cardiometabolic
biomarkers, a meta-analysis of 20 RCTs reported that cocoa
product consumption had a small but statistically significant
effect on lowering blood pressure (22.8 mm Hg systolic and
22.2 mm Hg diastolic) (63). Another meta-analysis of RCTs
conducted by Hooper et al. (10) showed that both flow-mediated
dilation and HOMA-IR were also improved after chocolate
consumption, and Shrime et al. (64) showed beneficial effects of
cocoa products of lowering blood pressure and improving insulin
sensitivity, lipid profiles, and flow-mediated dilation in a meta-
analysis of short-term studies. Our updated meta-analysis of
RCTs has not only updated previous findings (10) but also added
cardiometabolic biomarkers involved in lipid metabolism,
insulin resistance, systemic inflammation, renal function, and
oxidative stress.
Strengths of this meta-analysis include the synthesis of
evidence from RCTs that examined both conventional and
novel cardiometabolic biomarkers, detailed subgroup analyses
for potential effect modifiers, and a comprehensive evaluation of
potential bias. Our meta-analysis is among the first to our
knowledge to synthesize evidence for the novel, less-studied
cardiometabolic biomarkers. In addition, our subgroup analysis
found that cocoa flavanol interventions may have consistent
effects on the biomarkers of lipid metabolism and insulin
resistance regardless of age, sex, existing comorbidities, inter-
vention duration, RCT design, and the form and amount of
cocoa flavanols. Although the meta-regression analysis showed
that the difference between people with and without comorbid-
ities did not reach statistically significant cutoffs, possibly
because of the limited number of trials available, the benefits
for people with existing comorbidities seemed to be more
substantial than those without comorbidities, which warrant
further investigations.
There are several potential limitations to our study. First,
although 19 trials were included in the meta-analysis, the
number of studies for a specific biomarker varied. The number
of available RCTs is especially limited for lipoprotein(a),
oxidized LDL, VCAM-1, and leptin. In addition, the effect sizes
were small to moderate for most biomarkers. Therefore, findings
for those biomarkers need to be confirmed by further investi-
gations and interpreted with caution. In addition, the precision
of the estimates from individual RCTs was subject to small
samples and variable intervention durations. In addition to
providing comprehensive evidence for biomarkers of lipid
metabolism and insulin resistance, our study highlights the
urgent need for large long-term RCTs that improve our
understanding of how the short-term benefits of cocoa flavanol
intake on cardiometabolic biomarkers may be translated into
clinical outcomes. Second, the subgroup analyses were restricted
to biomarkers with $10 studies, and cutoffs used for categoriz-
ing modifiers were selected on an ad hoc basis. Third, because of
the heterogeneity of cocoa flavanol interventions and limited
evidence reported from RCTs, we were not able to distinguish
the effects of different active compounds of cocoa flavanol-rich
foods. However, we sought to maximize those data available

Cocoa flavanols and cardiometabolic health
2331

 from RCTs and found that any favorable effects of cocoa
flavanols on cardiometabolic risk factors did not seem to be
modified by the form or amount of cocoa flavanols. In addition,
because of the limited number of trials available, studies that
used different sources of blood for biomarker measurements
were synthesized together, which may have introduced addi-
tional heterogeneity. Fourth, as shown in Figure 2, our results
may be prone to the inherent weaknesses of individual RCTs.
In summary, our meta-analysis of RCTs indicates that cocoa
flavanol intake from cocoa products, chocolate, or cocoa
flavanol supplements may have modest but significant benefits
in lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and systemic inflamma-
tion. Further investigations, particularly large long-term RCTs,
are urgently needed to confirm or refute whether cocoa flavanols
represent a promising bioactive in the prevention of cardiome-
tabolic diseases.
