Summary
Background—Patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma have limited treatment options after 
failure of platinum-based chemotherapy. This multicenter, single-arm phase 2 trial evaluated 
atezolizumab, an engineered humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds selectively to 
programmed death–ligand 1 (PD-L1), in this population.
Methods—Three hundred and ten patients received atezolizumab (1200 mg, every 3 weeks). PD-
L1 expression on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (IC) was prospectively assessed by 
immunohistochemistry. The co-primary endpoints were the objective response rate by RECIST 
v1.1 and immune modified RECIST. A hierarchical testing procedure was used to test whether the 
objective response rate was significantly higher than the historical control of 10% at alpha level of 
0·05. Exploratory analyses included assessing the association between The Cancer Genome Atlas 
(TCGA) molecular subtypes, CD8+ T cell infiltration, mutation load, and clinical outcomes.
Findings—By independent review, objective response rates were 26% (95% CI 18 to 36) in the 
IC2/3 group, 18% (95% CI 13 to 24) in the IC1/2/3 group and 15% (95% CI 11 to 19) in all 
patients. With a median follow-up of 11·7 months, ongoing responses were observed in 84% of 
responders. The median duration of response was not reached (range 2·0*, 13·7* months,

 *censored). The median overall survival was 11·4 months (95% CI 9·0 to not estimable) in the 
IC2/3 group, 8·8 months (95% CI 7·1 to 10·6) in the IC1/2/3, and 7·9 months (95% CI 6·6 to 9·3) 
in all patients. Grade 3–4 related treatment-related adverse events occurred in 16% and grade 3–4 
immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 5% of treated patients. Exploratory analyses showed 
TCGA subtypes and mutation load to be independently predictive for response to atezolizumab.
Interpretation—Atezolizumab demonstrated durable activity and good tolerability in this 
population. PD-L1 expression on immune cells was associated with response. This is the first 
report to show the association of TCGA subtypes with response to immune checkpoint inhibition 
and demonstrate the importance of mutation load as a biomarker of response to this class of agents 
in advanced urothelial carcinoma.
Funding—F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.
Introduction
Urothelial carcinoma kills over 165,000 patients annually worldwide and is the ninth most 
common cancer overall.1,2 The efficacy of immunotherapy in non-muscle invasive urothelial 
carcinoma of the bladder was first established in 1976 with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, but no 
immunotherapy has been approved for the treatment of advanced disease.3 Platinum-based 
chemotherapy is the standard of care in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma, and is associated with an overall survival of approximately 9–15 months.4,5 The 
prognosis for patients who relapse after platinum-based therapy is dismal, with median 
survival ranging from five to seven months and no known life-prolonging treatments.6 Novel 
approaches are needed to break this therapeutic stalemate.
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) is an immune checkpoint that negatively regulates T 
cell function by binding to its receptors programmed death-1 (PD-1) or B7-1 on activated T 
lymphocytes and other immune cells. Because T lymphocytes play a central role in 
mediating acquired antitumoral immunity, expression of PD-L1 in the tumor 
microenvironment endows tumors with a mechanism to evade eradication by the host 
immune system.7–9 PD-L1 is broadly expressed across a wide range of malignancies, 
including urothelial carcinoma, and blockade of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has been shown 
to produce overall survival benefits in non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma and renal cell 
carcinoma.7,10–15
Recent data has suggested that immune checkpoint inhibitors are more active in tumors with 
high mutation rates.11,16–22 Emerging data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) 
indicated that urothelial carcinoma carried the third highest mutation rate and that gene 
expression signatures could be used to separate the disease into luminal and basal 
subtypes.23,24 Additional mechanisms such as increased prevalence of non-synonymous 
mutations, higher neoantigen load, higher antigen binding affinity, and select T effector 
signatures, have all been identified as factors that may predict for durable clinical benefit in 
patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors consistent with the hypothesis that 
mutations may create neoantigens that are recognized by anti-tumor T cells.25–29 Taken 
together, these observations provided a rationale for the clinical investigation of anti-PD-L1 
immunotherapy in metastatic urothelial cancer.

 Atezolizumab is an engineered humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin-G1 antibody that 
binds selectively to PD-L1 and prevents its interaction with PD-1 and B7.1 while sparing the 
interaction between PD-L2 and PD-1.30,31 Atezolizumab has demonstrated durable 
responses in a cohort of metastatic bladder cancer patients in a phase 1 study with higher 
response rates observed in patients with higher levels of PD-L1 expression on tumor 
infiltrating immune cells.32
To confirm the antitumor activity of atezolizumab in patients with advanced urothelial 
carcinoma whose disease had progressed after prior platinum-based chemotherapy, we 
conducted a phase 2, global, multicenter, single-arm trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of atezolizumab. Prospective evaluation of the association of PD-L1 expression with 
response was a co-primary endpoint. In addition, exploratory translational studies were 
conducted to address the scientific hypotheses associated with checkpoint inhibition in 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma.
Methods
Study Oversight and Conduct
The study (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02108652) was designed, conducted, and 
analyzed by employees of F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, the Sponsor, in collaboration with the 
study investigators. The study was approved by the independent review board at each 
participating site and was conducted in full conformance of the provisions of the Declaration 
of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice Guidelines. An independent Data Monitoring 
Committee reviewed the available safety data every 6 months after the first patient enrolled. 
The sponsor and the authors conducted data analyses and manuscript writing.
Study Design and Treatment
This was a phase 2, global, multicenter, single-arm two-cohort trial (figure 1, appendix). 
Cohort 1 consisted of patients who were treatment-naïve in the metastatic setting and 
considered to be cisplatin-ineligible and are not described in this report. Cohort 2 which 
consisted of patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
whose disease had progressed after prior platinum-based chemotherapy received a fixed 
dose of 1200 mg intravenous atezolizumab administered on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. 
Dose interruptions were allowed, but dose reductions were not permitted. Patients were 
informed of the potential for pseudoprogression as part of the consent process, and advised 
to discuss treatment beyond progression with their study physician. Patients were permitted 
to continue atezolizumab treatment after RECIST v1.1 criteria for progressive disease if they 
met pre-specified criteria for clinical benefit to allow for identification of non-conventional 
responses.
The primary endpoint of this study was objective response rate based upon two distinct 
methods: independent review facility (IRF)-assessed per RECIST version 1.1, and 
investigator-assessed per immune modified RECIST criteria to better evaluate atypical 
response kinetics observed with immunotherapy (see Study Protocol).33,34 Co-primary 
endpoints were chosen due to the emerging recognition that RECIST v1.1 may be

 inadequate to fully capture the benefit of the unique patterns of response from 
immunotherapeutic agents.35
Secondary endpoints included: duration of response and progression-free survival by both 
IRF per RECIST v1.1 and investigator assessed per immune modified RECIST, overall 
survival, 12-month overall survival, and safety. Exploratory analyses included the 
association between gene expression profiling, CD8+ T cell infiltration, and mutation load 
with IRF-assessed objective response.
Patients
Patients were eligible for enrollment in the study if they had histologically or cytologically 
documented locally advanced (T4b, any N; or any T, N 2–3) or metastatic (M1, Stage IV) 
urothelial carcinoma (including renal pelvis, ureter, urinary bladder, or urethra). Eligible 
patients had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 
1; measurable disease defined by RECIST v1.1; adequate hematologic and end-organ 
function; and no autoimmune disease or active infections. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
tumor specimens with sufficient viable tumor content were required prior to study 
enrollment.
Study Assessments
Measurable and evaluable lesions were assessed and documented prior to treatment. Patients 
underwent tumor assessments every 9 weeks for the first 12 months following Cycle 1, Day 
1. After 12 months, tumor assessments were performed every 12 weeks. Safety assessments 
were performed according to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE), Version 4.0. A sample of archived tumor tissues, as well as 
serum and plasma samples, was collected for exploratory biomarker assessments.
PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry
Patient tumor samples were prospectively and centrally assessed for PD-L1 expression by 
immunohistochemistry using the Ventana SP142 assay.36 The PD-L1 tumor-infiltrating 
immune cell (IC) status was defined by the percentage of PD-L1 positive ICs: IC0 (<1%); 
IC1 (≥1% but <5%); and IC2/3 (≥5%). Areas of BCG inflammatory response were excluded 
from the assessment of PD-L1 IC status. An analysis of PD-L1 expression on tumor cells 
and CD8+ infiltration by immunohistochemistry was also performed.30 (See the 
Supplementary Appendix for additional details).
Exploratory Biomarker Analyses
Gene expression levels were quantified by Illumina TruSeq RNA Access RNA-seq.37–39 
Molecular subtypes were assigned following TCGA, with some modifications to adapt for 
the use of RNA Access RNA-seq platform for FFPE tissues from our study.23 Mutation 
detection and mutation load assessment as estimated by targeted genomic profiling were 
performed by Foundation Medicine.40 These analyses were performed on tumor tissue 
collected during screening (see the appendix for additional details).

 Statistical Analysis
Efficacy analyses were based on the intent to treat population. Objective response rate was 
determined on the objective response-evaluable population, defined as intent to treat patients 
who had measureable disease per RECIST v1.1 at baseline, and duration of response 
analyses were performed on the subset of patients who achieved an objective response. The 
exact binomial test was used to test the binary endpoints of objective response rate. The 
time-to-event outcomes, including duration of response, progression free survival and 
overall survival were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method.41 The 95% CIs for median 
duration of response, progression free survival and overall survival were computed using a 
robust nonparametric Brookmeyer and Crowley method.42
For the primary endpoint of objective response rate, a hierarchical fixed-sequence testing 
procedure was used to compare the objective response rate between the treatment arm and a 
historical control for three pre-specified populations in the following order: objective 
response-evaluable patients with a PD-L1 IHC score of IC2/3, followed by IC1/2/3, 
followed by all objective response-evaluable patients (table 1, appendix). The hypothesis 
tests on these three populations were sequentially performed on the basis of IRF-assessed 
objective response rate according to RECIST v1.1 followed by the investigator-assessed 
objective response rate according to immune modified RECIST at a specific two-sided α 
level of 0·05 for each test, while controlling the overall Type I error at the same α level. If no 
statistical significance was detected at a particular level in the hierarchy, then no further 
hypothesis testing occurred. The study was designed to estimate the objective response rate 
in patients receiving atezolizumab and to detect an improvement in the objective response 
rate compared to 10%. No formal alternative objective response rate hypothesis was chosen. 
The study had a variable range of statistical power at different alternative objective response 
rates. We planned to enroll a minimum of approximately 100 IC2/3 patients resulting in an 
overall sample size of approximately 300 patients based upon an estimated 30% prevalence 
for the IC2/3 population. The 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson method for an observed 
objective response rate of 40% was 30% to 50%, and the study would have 100% power to 
detect a 30% increase in objective response rate from 10% to 40%.43 Alternatively, the 95% 
CI using the Clopper-Pearson method for an observed objective response rate of 20% was 
13% to 29%, and the study would have 85% power to detect a 10% increase from 10% to 
20%. The primary analysis was triggered by a minimum of 24-weeks of follow-up from the 
last patient enrolled. This report used a later data cutoff of September 14, 2015 to explore 
duration of response.
Safety analyses were performed on all treated patients, defined as enrolled patients who 
received any amount of the study drug. We performed analyses of objective response rate in 
pre-specified subgroups based on known baseline prognostic factors and reported 
descriptively. No formal hypothesis testing was planned. Additional biomarker analyses 
beyond PD-L1 IC were exploratory only and not pre-specified. The biomarker evaluable 
population was based upon the objective response-evaluable population who had available 
associated gene expression and mutational load data.

Results
A total of 486 patients were screened and 315 patients were enrolled on the study in Cohort 
2 between May 2014 and November 2014 (figure 1 and figure 1, appendix). Three hundred 
and ten patients received at least one dose of atezolizumab and were evaluable for efficacy 
and safety. At the time of the data cutoff on September 14, 2015, 202 patients (65%) had 
discontinued treatment (193 patients had died, 8 due to withdrawal by patient and 1 due to 
other reasons).
Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the patients. Forty one percent of patients 
had received two or more prior systemic regimens for metastatic disease. Many patients had 
adverse prognostic risk factors, including, visceral and/or liver metastasis at study entry 
(78% and 31%, respectively), and baseline hemoglobin <10 g/dL (22%).
Tissue for PD-L1 immunohistochemistry analysis consisted of surgical resection specimens 
(n=215), biopsies (i.e., core needle or forceps) from primary lesions (n=23) or metastatic 
sites (n=41), transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) samples (n=29) and biopsy 
from unknown lesion (n=2). PD-L1 IC2/3 prevalence was higher in resection and TURBT 
specimens versus biopsies from primary lesions or metastatic sites (39% and 34% versus 
17% and 8%, respectively). PD-L1 IC2/3 prevalence in primary tumor samples (regardless 
of specimen type) was 33%, (n=233) while PD-L1 IC2/3 prevalence in metastatic tumor 
samples was 28% (n=78). Patients were evenly distributed between the PD-L1 IC groups; 
IC0 (33%), IC1 (35%), and IC2/3 (32%). Baseline characteristics were well balanced 
between the IC2/3 group, IC1/2/3 group, and the intent to treat population (table 1).
The primary analysis demonstrated that treatment with atezolizumab resulted in a 
significantly improved RECIST v1.1 objective response rate for each pre-specified IC group 
[IC2/3, 27% (95% CI 19 to 37), p<0·0001; IC1/2/3, 18% (95% CI 13 to 24), p=0·0004; and 
all patients, 15% (95% CI, 11 to 20), p=0·0058] compared to a historical control overall 
response rate of 10% (table 2, appendix). The updated analysis of efficacy described herein 
was later conducted to assess the durability of response (table 2). By independent 
radiological review (RECIST v1.1), the updated analysis of efficacy showed an objective 
response rate of 26% (95% CI 18 to 36) in the IC2/3 group, including 11% of patients who 
achieved a complete response. In the IC1/2/3 group, the objective response rate was 18% 
(95% CI 13 to 24), with complete response observed in 13 patients (6%). For all evaluable 
patients, the objective response rate was 15% (95% CI 11 to 19); with complete response 
observed in 15 patients (5%) (figure 2, appendix). Investigator-assessed response rates (per 
immune modified RECIST) were similar to the RECIST v1.1 results (table 2). With a

 median follow-up of 11·7 months, the median duration of response was not yet reached in 
any of the PD-L1 immunohistochemistry groups (range, 2·0*, 13·7* months, *censored 
values) (data for IC2/3 group is shown in figure 2A–C; IC0 and IC1 groups shown in figure 
3, appendix). At the time of the data cut-off, ongoing responses were observed in 38 of the 
45 responding patients (84%). The median time to response was 2·1 months (95% CI 2·0 to 
2·2).
To account for the occurrence of pseudoprogression, patients were allowed to continue 
treatment beyond IRF RECIST v1.1 progression. One hundred and twenty one patients were 
treated beyond progression for a median of 7·8 weeks, and of these, 21 (17%) subsequently 
experienced target lesion reduction of at least 30% from their baseline scans (figure 4, 
appendix).
Durable responses observed included patients with upper tract disease and patients with poor 
prognostic features. While the presence of liver metastasis in patients resulted in a lower 
objective response rate compared to patients with no liver metastases (5% vs 19%, table 3, 
appendix), these responses were durable with the median duration of response not reached at 
the time of the data cut-off (95% CI not estimable). A similar trend was observed in patients 
with visceral metastases (10% vs 31% for patients with no visceral metastases) and ECOG 
PS 1 (8% vs 25% for patients with ECOG PS 0). The absence of visceral metastasis (i.e., 
lymph-node only disease) at baseline was associated with the highest complete response 
rate. The median duration of response was not yet reached across any subgroup analyzed.
With a median survival follow-up of approximately 11·7 months (range, 0·2* to 15·2; 
*denotes a censored value) the median progression-free survival (RECIST v1.1) was 2·1 
months among all patients (95% CI 2·1 to 2·1) and similar across all IC groups. The 
investigator-assessed median progression-free survival by immune modified RECIST criteria 
was 4·0 months (95% CI 2·6 to 5·9) in the IC2/3 group compared to 2·9 months (95% CI 2·1 
to 4·1) in the IC1/2/3 group and 2·7 months (95% CI 2·1 to 3·9) in all patients.
The median overall survival was 11·4 months (95% CI 9·0 to not estimable) for the IC2/3 
group, 8·8 months (95% CI 7·1 to 10·6) in the IC1/2/3 group, and 7·9 months (95% CI 6·6 to 
9·3) for the entire cohort of patients, (figure 2D). The 12-month landmark overall survival 
rate was 48% in the IC2/3 (95% CI 38 to 58) group, 39% in the IC1/2/3 (95% CI 32 to 46) 
group and 36% (95% CI 30 to 41) in the intent to treat population. In patients who received 
only one prior line of therapy (n=124) in the metastatic setting and no prior adjuvant/
neoadjuvant therapy, the median overall survival was not estimable (95% CI 9·3 to not 
estimable) for the IC2/3 group, 10.3 months (95% CI 7·5 to 12·7) in the IC1/2/3 group, and 
9·0 months (95% CI 7·1 to 10·9) for the entire second-line population.
The median duration of treatment was 12 weeks (range, 0 to 66). All cause, any grade 
adverse events were reported in 97% of patients, with 55% of patients experiencing a grade 
3–4 event (table 4, appendix). Sixty-nine percent of patients had a treatment-related adverse 
event of any grade, and 16% of patients had a grade 3–4 related adverse event. Treatment-
related serious adverse events were observed in 11% of patients. There were no treatment-
related deaths reported on study. The majority of treatment-related adverse events were mild

 to moderate in nature, with fatigue (30%), nausea (14%), decreased appetite (12%) pruritus 
(10%), pyrexia (9%), diarrhea (8%), rash (7%) and arthralgia (7%) among the most common 
any grade events (table 3). The incidence of grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events was 
low, with fatigue the most commonly occurring at 2% (table 3). There were no reports of 
febrile neutropenia.
Seven percent of patients had an immune-mediated adverse event of any grade, with 
pneumonitis (2%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (1%), increased alanine 
aminotransferase (1%), rash (1%) and dyspnea (1%) being the most common adverse events. 
Five percent had a grade 3–4 immune-mediated adverse event (all cause). No immune-
mediated renal toxicity was observed. Thirty percent of patients had an adverse event 
leading to dose interruption. Four percent of patients experienced an adverse event that lead 
to treatment withdrawal. Twenty-two percent (69/310) of patients had an adverse event 
requiring systemic steroid use.
Exploratory translational analyses showed that PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on 
tumor infiltrating immune cells (IC) was associated with expression of genes in a CD8 T 
effector set (Teff) (figure 3A; figure 5A, appendix). Among genes in the Teff set, responses to 
atezolizumab were most closely associated with high expression of two interferon-γ-
inducible T helper 1 (TH1)-type chemokines, CXCL9 (p=0·0057) and CXCL10 (p=0·0079, 
figure 3B). A similar, though less pronounced, trend was also seen with respect to other 
genes in the set (figure 5B, appendix). Consistent with increased T-cell trafficking 
chemokine expression, tumor center CD8+ T cell infiltration was also associated with both 
PD-L1 IC (p<0·0001, figure 3C) and response to atezolizumab (p=0·0265, figure 3D).
After adapting the TCGA classification approach for use with our expression assay, gene 
expression analysis (n=195) was used to classify patients into luminal (n=73) and basal 
(n=122) subtypes as defined by TCGA (figure 6, appendix). PD-L1 IC prevalence was 
highly enriched in the basal subtype versus the luminal subtype (60% vs 23%, p<0·0001, 
figure 3E) with IC2/3 expression of 15% in the papillary-like luminal cluster I, 34% in the 
cluster II, 68% in the squamous-like basal cluster III and 50% in the basal cluster IV 
subtype. Elevated PD-L1 tumor cell expression was almost exclusively seen in the basal 
subtype (39% in basal vs 4% in luminal, p<0·0001, figure 3F) and did not correlate with 
objective response rate. Consistent with PD-L1 IC2/3 expression, CD8 T-effector gene 
expression was elevated in luminal cluster II and basal cluster III/IV and not in luminal 
cluster I (figure 6, appendix). Response to atezolizumab occurred in all TCGA subtypes but 
was significantly higher in the luminal cluster II subtype than in other subtypes, which 
demonstrated an objective response rate of 34% (p=0·0017, figure 3G).
Mutation load was estimated in 150 patients by examining a representative panel of 315 
cancer-related genes. The median mutation load was significantly increased in responders 
(12·4/Mb) compared to non-responders (6.4/Mb) (p<0.0001, figure 3H). The relationship 
between mutation load and response was unrelated to TCGA subtype (p=0·2200, figure 3H) 
or IC subgroup (figure 7, appendix). A subgroup analysis of only those patients with bladder 
primary tumors, (figure 8, appendix), produced essentially equivalent results. Finally,

 smoking status did not correlate with mutation load (p=0·2454) or with response (p=0·5373) 
to atezolizumab.
Discussion
Since the development of combination treatment with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin 
and cisplatin chemotherapy thirty years ago, there have been no major improvements in the 
treatment outcomes for patients with urothelial carcinoma.44 The results of this large single 
arm phase 2 study show that atezolizumab induced durable anti-tumor responses in patients 
with advanced urothelial carcinoma whose tumors have progressed during or after platinum-
based chemotherapy. This trial included heavily pre-treated patients and notably, the median 
duration of response had not been reached despite a median follow-up of 11.7 months. The 
low incidence of clinically relevant treatment-related adverse events makes atezolizumab 
widely applicable in this patient population who often has multiple co-morbidities and/or 
renal impairment. This durable efficacy and tolerability is striking in comparison to 
outcomes observed with currently available second-line chemotherapy for urothelial 
carcinoma.6,45,46
The 12-month overall survival rate in the entire cohort that included approximately 41% of 
patients treated in the third- or later-line was 48% (95% CI 38 to 58) in the IC2/3 group, 
39% in the IC1/2/3 (95% CI 32 to 46) group and 36% (95% CI 30 to 41) in the ITT 
population. These overall survival results compare favorably to a landmark 12-month 
survival rate of 20% (95% CI 17 to 24) from a pooled analysis of ten phase 2 trials that 
evaluated 646 patients who received second-line chemotherapy or biologics.47
Currently, the prognostic value of PD-L1 IC expression is unknown, with conflicting reports 
in the literature, although it does not appear to be associated with validated adverse risk 
factors in this data set.48,49 Therefore, it appears likely that the improved survival in this 
patient population is related to atezolizumab treatment. The results of ongoing randomized 
studies (NCT02302807) are needed to appropriately assess the prognostic and predictive 
value of the Ventana SP142 immunohistochemistry assay, and to better understand which 
patients derive clinical benefit.
Responses to atezolizumab were associated with both conventional RECIST as well as 
atypical response kinetics, with an additional 17% of patients treated beyond progression 
having shrinkage (at least 30% reduction) of target lesions following RECIST v1.1 
progression. The median progression-free survival was similar across the 
immunohistochemistry subsets with RECIST v1.1; however, it increased when immune 
modified RECIST criteria were utilized to account for the non-classical responses that may 
be observed with cancer immunotherapy. In this study, a disconnect between progression-
free survival and overall survival was observed, similar to other immune checkpoint agents 
in other diseases, further suggesting that modifications of RECIST v1.1 are needed to better 
capture the benefit of immunotherapy treatment.
This study required a tumor specimen to be submitted during screening for prospective PD-
L1 testing using the Ventana SP142 assay. In a pre-specified analysis, higher levels of PD-

 L1 immunohistochemistry expression on immune cells were associated with a higher 
response rate to atezolizumab and longer overall survival. In contrast, the frequency of PD-
L1 expression on tumor cells was low and did not show an association with objective 
response, lending further support to the importance of adaptive immunity in driving clinical 
benefit to immune checkpoint inhibitors.
Similarly, the association of immune activation gene subsets (e.g., CXCL9, and CD8A) and 
other immune checkpoint genes (PD-L1, CTLA-4, TIGIT, data not shown) with IC PD-L1 
expression suggests that the IC PD-L1 expression represents adaptive immune regulation 
and the presence of a pre-existing (but suppressed) immune response in urothelial carcinoma 
tumors.30 The presence of other negative regulators (e.g., TIGIT) further suggests that 
combination immunotherapeutic approaches may further enhance responses.
In addition to PD-L1 immunohistochemistry expression on immune cells, response to 
atezolizumab was strongly correlated with mutation load. This association was independent 
of the association between TCGA subtype or PD-L1 IC score and response (figure 9, 
appendix). This study employed a novel approach to interrogating the FoundationOne panel 
that covers ~3% of the exome to estimate mutation load. Although this targeted approach 
interrogated a much smaller fraction of the exome than typically used for mutation load 
estimation, a re-analysis of TCGA bladder urothelial carcinoma mutation data showed that 
whole-exome results were well-correlated with those obtained from only the FoundationOne 
regions (figure 10, appendix). Moreover, the correlation of mutational load and response to 
atezolizumab is consistent with the pattern observed in other malignancies, and reinforces 
the concept that the multiple mutations that occur in cancer create novel epitopes against 
which protective T cell responses are directed.25
Interestingly, the molecular subtypes identified by the TCGA analysis were also associated 
with response to atezolizumab, suggesting that in addition to PD-L1 expression, subtypes 
differed in underlying immune biology. While responses were observed across all TCGA 
subtypes, significantly higher response rates were observed in the luminal cluster II subtype, 
which was characterized by transcriptional signatures associated with the presence of 
activated T effector cells. In contrast, luminal cluster I was associated with low expression of 
CD8+ effector genes, lower PD-L1 IC/TC expression and lower responses to atezolizumab, 
consistent with a landscape often devoid of pre-existing immune activity. Basal clusters III 
and IV were also associated with increased PD-L1 IC expression as well as CD8+ effector 
genes. However, unlike luminal cluster II, basal clusters III/IV also exhibited high PD-L1 
TC expression. The reduced response rates in the basal subtypes compared to luminal cluster 
II strongly suggests that other immunosuppressive factors exist in the basal subtypes that 
prevent effective T cell activation with inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway. The 
differences in the immune landscape of luminal versus basal subtypes highlight the need to 
further understand the underlying immune biology to develop future rational combination or 
sequential treatment strategies.
While PD-L1 IC status clearly is associated with atezolizumab response, incorporation of 
TCGA gene expression subtype, mutation load, or both of these novel biomarkers into a 
model based on PD-L1 IC staining significantly improved the association with response

 (figure 9, appendix). Thus, disease subtype and mutation load do not simply recapitulate the 
information already provided by PD-L1 expression in immune cells, but rather, they provide 
independent and complementary information. Additional data and larger sample sizes are 
required to allow the formal construction of a multi-marker classifier, and continued 
consideration of all three biomarkers is warranted in next generation companion diagnostics.
In conclusion, we report that targeting PD-L1 with atezolizumab is effective in heavily 
pretreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma patients, and that responses 
are more common in patients with higher levels of PD-L1 expression on immune cells. The 
efficacy appears to be driven by underlying genomic, molecular and immunologic factors.
