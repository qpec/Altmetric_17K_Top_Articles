IMPORTANCE While the proportion of adults who smoke cigarettes has declined substantially
in the past decade, socioeconomic disparities in cigarette smoking remain. Few interventions
have targeted low socioeconomic status (SES) and minority smokers in primary care settings.
OBJECTIVE To evaluate a multicomponent intervention to promote smoking cessation among
low-SES and minority smokers.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS For this prospective, unblinded, randomized clinical trial
conducted between May 1, 2015, and September 4, 2017, adults 18 years and older who spoke
English, smoked 10 or more cigarettes per day in the past week, were contemplating or
preparing to quit smoking, and had a primary care clinician were recruited from general
internal medicine and family medicine practices at 1 large safety-net hospital in Boston,
Massachusetts.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to a control group that received an enhancement
of usual care (n = 175 participants) or to an intervention group that received up to 4 hours of
patient navigation delivered over 6 months in addition to usual care, as well as financial
incentives for biochemically confirmed smoking cessation at 6 and 12 months following
enrollment (n = 177 participants).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome determined a priori was
biochemically confirmed smoking cessation at 12 months.
RESULTS Among 352 patients who were randomized (mean [SD] age, 50.0 [11.0] years;
191 women [54.3%]; 197 participants who identified as non–Hispanic black [56.0%];
40 participants who identified as Hispanic of any race [11.4%]), all were included in the
intention-to-treat analysis. At 12 months following enrollment, 21 participants [11.9%] in the
navigation and incentives group, compared with 4 participants [2.3%] in the control group,
had quit smoking (odds ratio, 5.8; 95% CI, 1.9-17.1; number needed to treat, 10.4; P < .001).
In prespecified subgroup analyses, the intervention was particularly beneficial for older
participants (19 [19.8%] vs 1 [1.0%]; P < .001), women (17 [16.8%] vs 2 [2.2%]; P < .001),
participants with household yearly income of $20 000 or less (15 [15.5%] vs 3 [3.1%];
P = .003), and nonwhite participants (21 [15.2%] vs 4 [3.0%]; P < .001).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this study of adult daily smokers at 1 large urban safety-net
hospital, patient navigation and financial incentives for smoking cessation significantly
increased the rates of smoking cessation.

 T
obacco use is the leading cause of preventable morbid-
ity and mortality in the United States. While the pro-
portionofadultswhosmokecigaretteshasdeclinedsub-
stantially in the past decade, socioeconomic disparities in
cigarette smoking remain. In 2015, smoking prevalence among
persons living below the poverty level (26.1%) was nearly
double that of persons living at or above the poverty level
(13.9%).1 Smoking prevalence among persons of low socioeco-
nomic status (SES) has remained high, despite population-
based interventions such as tobacco price increases and free
access to tobacco cessation counseling and medications.
Given that multicomponent interventions have shown the
most promise in reducing health disparities,2 we imple-
mented a smoking cessation intervention among smokers at
asafety-nethospitalthatincluded2approachesthathavebeen
used to address health disparities: (1) financial incentives; and
(2) patient navigation, where a layperson from the commu-
nity guides individuals through the health care system to re-
ceive appropriate services. Research has shown that financial
incentives are effective for smoking cessation in an em-
ployed population,3 among pregnant and newly postpartum
women,4 homeless smokers,5 disadvantaged smokers who at-
tended a tobacco cessation clinic,6 as well as among low-
income smokers from the general population.7 While 2 small
randomized clinical trials (RCTs)8,9 have demonstrated feasi-
bility and acceptability of patient navigation to promote smok-
ing cessation among disadvantaged smokers, we are un-
aware of previous efficacy studies. We combined these 2
intervention components, anticipating that incentives would
augment smokers’willingness to connect with a navigator and
that the navigator would connect people with treatments
through which incentives can work.
In this RCT involving primary care patients at a large ur-
ban safety-net hospital, our objective was to evaluate the ef-
fectofamulticomponentfinancialincentivesandpatientnavi-
gation intervention in improving biochemically confirmed
smoking cessation at 12 months. We hypothesized that the in-
tervention would increase the likelihood of smoking cessa-
tion relative to an enhancement of usual care.
Methods
Design
The trial was a prospective, unblinded, RCT conducted from
May 1, 2015, to September 4, 2017 (12-month follow-up data
are presented) for low-SES and minority daily smokers receiv-
ingprimarycareatBostonMedicalCenter,alargeurbansafety-
net hospital. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1.10
Through stratified randomization, participants were as-
signed to 1 of 2 groups. Enhanced traditional care control par-
ticipants received a low literacy smoking cessation brochure11
andalistofhospitalandcommunityresourcesforsmokingces-
sation. Intervention participants received the same materi-
als; in addition, they received up to 4 hours of patient naviga-
tion delivered over 6 months, and financial incentives for
biochemicallyconfirmedsmokingcessationat6and12months
followingenrollment.Werandomizedparticipantsusingaran-
dom number generator with allocation concealment to a re-
search assistant using sealed envelopes. Randomization was
stratified by stage of change (contemplation vs preparation)
with regard to smoking cessation. The primary outcome was
biochemically confirmed smoking cessation at 12 months.
Ethics
The institutional review board (IRB) of the Boston University
Medical Campus approved the trial, and written informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants. The IRB advised that
the exact dollar amount of the incentives not be noted in the
informed consent owing to concerns about (1) retention in the
control arm; (2) enrollment of “professional subjects”; and (3)
potential coercion among low SES participants. Owing to con-
cerns that the efficacy of the incentives was reduced by this
approach, the study team obtained IRB approval to disclose
the exact dollar amount of the incentives to intervention par-
ticipants midway through the trial. Therefore, at the 6-month
assessment, only some patients were aware of the exact dol-
lar amount of the incentives. At the 12-month assessment, all
intervention participants had been notified of the exact dol-
lar amount of the incentives.
Participants
Recruitment took place May 2015 through March 2016 in Bos-
ton Medical Center’
s adult primary care waiting rooms. In ad-
dition, potentially eligible individuals identified in the pri-
mary care practice’
s patient registry received letters inviting
them to participate in the study, with an opportunity to opt
out of further study contact. Individuals who did not opt out
received recruitment phone calls from a research assistant. Eli-
gibility criteria included age of 18 years or older; smoking 10
or more cigarettes per day in the past week; contemplation or
preparation stage of readiness to quit smoking; having a pri-
mary care clinician in the Section of General Internal Medi-
cine or Department of Family Medicine; having telephone ac-
cess;speakingEnglish;andbeingableandwillingtoparticipate
in the study protocol and provide informed consent. We ex-
cluded individuals who were actively using evidence-based
smoking cessation treatment. In addition, we excluded Span-
ish-speaking patients as only 7% of adult primary care pa-
tients at Boston Medical Center speak Spanish.
Key Points
Question Does a multicomponent intervention with a patient
navigator and financial incentives for biochemically confirmed
smoking cessation improve smoking cessation rates at 12 months
among underserved adult primary care smokers when compared
with an enhancement of usual care alone?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial that included 352 adults,
the proportion with biochemically confirmed smoking cessation at
12 months was 11.9% with navigation and incentives vs 2.3% with
an enhancement of usual care.
Meaning Among smokers at an urban safety-net hospital,
navigation and incentives for smoking cessation significantly
increased smoking cessation rates.

 Interventions
Conceptual Model
The Social Contextual Model12 guided the interventions. The
modelpresentsaspectsoftheparticipants’socialcontext,such
as stress, financial problems, social networks, and multiple
familyrolesthatinfluencehowpopulationcharacteristics(race/
ethnicity and SES) might affect behavior patterns. Incorporat-
ing social contextual factors into intervention design has been
shown to promote behavior change among racial/ethnic mi-
nority groups.13 The theory of operant conditioning,14 chang-
ing behavior by the use of reinforcement which is given after
the desired response, guided the financial incentives inter-
vention component.
Enhanced Traditional Care Control
In addition to traditional care, which consists of assessment
of smoking status and brief cessation counseling, partici-
pants in this group received a low–literacy smoking cessation
brochure11 and a list of hospital and community resources for
smokingcessation.Patientnavigatorsdidnotinteractwithpar-
ticipants assigned to this group.
Patient Navigation and Financial Incentives
Participants in this group received the same materials as par-
ticipants in the enhanced traditional care group. In addition,
they were eligible to receive up to 4 hours of patient naviga-
tion delivered over 6 months. Two patient navigators re-
ceived 10 hours of training in motivational interviewing
techniques,15 including use of a structured script (eAppendix
in Supplement 2) and promotion of smoking cessation in un-
derserved patient populations. One navigator had completed
some college, had worked as a navigator in 3 previous trials
of patient navigation,8,16,17 and had served as a community
health worker. The other navigator had a bachelor’
s degree in
human services and had previously worked as a community
health advocate and as an outreach coordinator for Boston’
s
Mayor’
s Health Line. After enrollment, patient navigators con-
tacted participants either to talk by phone or to arrange an in-
personmeeting.Wedidnotdesignateaspecificnumberofcalls
or meetings, but allotted a goal of 4 hours of patient naviga-
tion time per patient. The navigators identified and dis-
cussed salient social contextual factors using motivational in-
terviewing techniques.15 Among participants ready to quit
smoking, the navigators directly connected patients to exist-
ing yet underused smoking cessation resources such as the
Massachusetts quit line and the hospital-based smoking ces-
sation group. The navigators also discussed medications; for
participants interested in using bupropion or varenicline, the
navigators helped to arrange follow-up with the participant’
s
primary care clinician. For participants who desired nicotine
replacement therapy (NRT), the navigator prompted the study
physician (K.E.L.) to send prescriptions to the participants’
pharmacies through the electronic health record (EHR). While
not formally trained as tobacco treatment specialists, the navi-
gators delivered some smoking cessation-related counseling.
We defined the minimum navigation intervention dose as
completion of the script incorporating motivational interview-
ing techniques, by telephone or in person.
A research assistant provided financial incentives fol-
lowing assessments and biochemically confirmed cessation.
The distribution of incentives follows those in a previous
study3: $250 for smoking cessation 6 months after study
enrollment, as confirmed by a salivary cotinine, and an addi-
tional $500 for an additional 6 months after the initial cessa-
tion (12-month time point), confirmed by a salivary cotinine.
Participants who did not quit smoking at 6 months and who
had been unaware of the exact dollar amount of the incen-
tive were given a “second chance” to quit smoking and earn
$250 at 12 months, having been notified of the exact amount
of the incentive. Study staff distributed incentives to
patients who successfully quit smoking by providing a debit
card loaded with the incentive amount.
Intervention Fidelity
During the intervention, 2 study investigators (K.E.L. and
L.M.Q.) met weekly with the navigators to discuss their case
load and to review their use of motivational interviewing tech-
niques. We listened to audiotapes of navigation sessions and
provided feedback on use of reflections and open-ended ques-
tions, and whether the navigators conveyed empathy and in-
teracted with participants in a nonjudgmental manner.
Outcomes
Theprimaryoutcomewasbiochemicallyconfirmedsmokingces-
sation at 12 months. A research assistant, unblinded to study
groupassignment,attemptedtocontactallparticipantsbytele-
phone6and12monthsafterenrollment,andaskedwhetherthey
had stopped smoking. Participants who reported complete ab-
stinence (not even a puff of a cigarette) for at least 7 days before
being contacted during any follow-up interview were asked to
come to the hospital to provide a saliva or urine sample for con-
firmation of smoking cessation with use of a cotinine (half-life,
17hours)18oranabasinetest(2weekdetectionwindow),19respec-
tively. We considered a cotinine level of 10 ng/mL or less to in-
dicate smoking cessation.20 Among participants who were tak-
ing NRT, we considered an anabasine level of less than 3 ng/mL
to indicate smoking cessation.21 As smokers, we categorized all
patients who self-reported abstinence, but were identified as
smokersviabiochemicalvalidation;self-reportedabstinencebut
refused biochemical verification; or could not be located. Par-
ticipants in both study arms received $15 and $20, respectively,
forcompletingeachoftheassessments.Aftereachinterview,par-
ticipantsinbothstudyarmswhoreportedthattheyhadstopped
smoking received an additional $15 for submitting a sample for
biochemical verification.
We obtained data on receipt of medications for smoking
cessation (NRT, bupropion, and varenicline) and attendance
at the hospital smoking cessation group via manual chart
review. For all participants who were biochemically con-
firmed quit at 12 months, we reviewed all office visit notes to
their primary care clinician for the 6 months following the
date of their 12-month assessment, as well as the medical
problem list, to ascertain documentation of current smok-
ing. Finally, we obtained data from the Massachusetts
Department of Public Health on participant use of the Mas-
sachusetts telephone quit line.

 Covariates
We assessed the following sociodemographic variables at base-
line:age,sex,maritalstatus,insurance,income,education,em-
ployment,andracial/ethnicgroup.Wemeasuredlevelsofnico-
tine dependence with the Fagerström Test for Nicotine
Dependence22 and interest in quitting, as measured by stage of
readinesstoquitsmoking.23Weusedvalidatedmeasuresofstress
(the 4-item Perceived Stress Scale),24 chaos (a 6-item Chaos
Scale),25 and hassles (the 9-item Abbreviated Hassles Index)26
to assess life circumstances that may be barriers to cessation.
Statistical Methods
We estimated that at 12 months, 5% of participants in the en-
hanced traditional care study arm would quit smoking, rela-
tive to 20% of participants in the navigation and incentives
study arm. We based these estimates on data from prior smok-
ing cessation studies that included low SES adult smokers.9,27
We recruited 175 smokers in the enhanced traditional care con-
trol arm and 177 smokers in the navigation and incentives arm,
with 88% power to detect a 5% vs 20% difference in cessation
rates between the 2 groups, with a 2-sided α of 0.05.
Analyses
The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat analysis of the
difference in the likelihood of biochemically confirmed ces-
sation between the enhanced traditional care control and navi-
gation and incentives groups at 12 months. The similarity of
thestudygroupswithrespecttocovariatesatbaselinewasana-
lyzed by the χ2 test for categorical variables and the Student
t test for continuous variables. We used multivariable logistic
regression to control for potential confounders identified in
bivariable analyses as well as variables of a priori clinical
significance28,29 (sex, age, race/ethnicity, income, education,
and receipt of an NRT prescription). Because few patients quit
smoking in either study arm, we evaluated the adjusted mod-
els by including only 2 parameters in addition to the interven-
tion group variable. We examined the effect of the interven-
tionvariable,andcontrollingforage,theneachoftheadditional
variables as a third variable.
Weexpectedthemajorityofmissingdatatobeduetomov-
ing or failure to remain in the study. We investigated whether
missing data was associated with patient characteristics. We
analyzed Pearson correlation coefficients to identify collinear-
ity among variables in the model; the correlation between vari-
ables ranged from −0.16 to 0.17 suggesting the absence of col-
linearity. Variance inflation factors for the predictors were all
below 1.5, also suggesting no evidence of collinearity in the re-
gression model. All analyses were conducted using SAS ver-
sion 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc).
Results
This study assessed 892 patients for eligibility and randomized
352.TheFigureshowsreasonsforexclusion,randomization,and
follow-up, and Table 1 shows descriptive characteristics for the
enhanced traditional care control and navigation and financial
incentives groups. The 2 groups were not different in demo-
graphic and smoking characteristics. The majority reported be-
longing to a racial/ethnic minority group, having low income
(≤$20 000/y), and low educational attainment (high school
graduate or less). Participants smoked a mean of 15 cigarettes
per day. Fifty-two participants in the navigation and incentives
group (29.4%) were lost to follow-up or withdrew in the first 6
months, relative to 32 participants in the control group (18.3%)
(P = .01). Participants lost to follow-up at 6 months were more
likely to be male or white. At 12 months, 48 participants (27.1%)
and 53 participants (30.3%) were lost to follow-up in the navi-
gation and incentives group and the enhanced traditional care
controlgroup,respectively(P = .51).Participantswhowerelost
to follow-up at 12 months were younger and more likely to be
male than patients who were retained.

arm, 5 of 21 intervention participants (23.8%) had documen-
tation of current smoking relative to 2 of 4 (50%) of control par-
ticipants (P = .29). Twelve participants (7%) in the naviga-
tion and incentives group were abstinent at both the 6-month
and 12-month assessments, relative to 0% of the control par-
ticipants (P ≤ .001).
Stratified analyses demonstrated that the navigation and
incentivesinterventionwasparticularlybeneficialforolderpar-
ticipants, women, nonwhite participants, those with the low-
est incomes, non–heavy smokers, and those in the contem-
plation stage with respect to smoking cessation (Table 3).
The odds ratio (OR) for quitting at 12 months was signifi-
cantly higher in the navigation and incentives group than in
the control group in the unadjusted model (OR, 5.76; 95%
CI, 1.93-17.13). In the adjusted models, older participants,
women, and those who had NRT prescribed had an
increased odds of quitting at 12 months (Table 4). The aver-
age dollar amount per participant that was paid out for
smoking cessation was $480.77.

 Discussion
A multicomponent intervention combining patient naviga-
tion and financial incentives substantially increased rates of
biochemically confirmed smoking cessation at 12 months
among minority and low-SES primary care smokers served by
a large, urban safety-net hospital. Our study extends the work
of Kendzor et al,6 who demonstrated the short-term effect of
offering small financial incentives for biochemically verified
abstinence. Like Kendzor et al,6 we found that the interven-
tion was particularly effective among women. Kendzor et al6
focused on patients who attended a tobacco cessation clinic
at a safety-net hospital, while our study included a broader
group of primary care smokers not already in treatment. The
patient navigation component of our intervention was simi-
lar to a telephone counseling intervention implemented by
Haas et al30 among low SES primary care smokers. As was the
case in our study, Haas et al30 included counselling and refer-
rals to community resources to address sociocontextual me-
diators of tobacco use. However, Haas et al30 did not provide
biochemical verification of abstinence.
We were struck that not a single white smoker in our study
quit smoking in either study arm. This observation is concern-
ing, especially given the recently documented increase in
midlife morbidity and mortality among white non-Hispanic
women and men in the United States.31 There are several pos-
sible explanations for this finding. First, neither of the pa-
tient navigators was white. Others have shown that patient-
navigator race concordance improves care after cancer
screening abnormalities are detected.32 Second, racial differ-
ences exist in the rate of nicotine metabolism, with African-
American individuals, on average, having a slower rate of nico-
tine metabolism compared with white individuals.33 Studies
have shown that slow metabolizers of nicotine should use
transdermal nicotine, while fast metabolizers should use
varenicline.34 Given that our navigators were most easily able
to access nicotine replacement therapy for study partici-
pants, white smokers, who may have benefited from vareni-
cline, were at a disadvantage.
It is remarkable that so many participants in the interven-
tion arm quit smoking, given that so few used medications to
quit. By using a medication to quit smoking, individuals are 2
to 3 times more likely to quit smoking.35-37 Multiple studies
have demonstrated underutilization of pharmacotherapy and
enduring misconceptions about pharmacotherapy, particu-
larly among black smokers.8,38 We had anticipated that a
patient navigator, as a layperson from the participants’

 community, might be able to address these misconceptions.
The fact that 1 of 3 of intervention participants had a prescrip-
tion for NRT sent to their pharmacy suggests that the naviga-
tors were successful with regard to NRT. At the time of the in-
tervention, the EAGLES trial,39 which showed no significant
increase in neuropsychiatric adverse events attributable to va-
renicline or bupropion relative to nicotine patch or placebo,
had not yet been published. Future patient navigation inter-
ventions could focus on linking more patients to varenicline
therapy, particularly white smokers. Similarly, very few par-
ticipants referred to smoking cessation counseling resources
actually used those services. In future iterations, patient navi-
gators should be trained as bona fide smoking cessation coun-
selors so that they may provide cessation counseling to pa-
tients during their contacts.
Limitations
This study had several limitations. It is unclear whether ab-
stinence at either of the 2 assessment points was transient or
long lasting. Our findings may not be generalizable to safety-
net settings with large numbers of uninsured smokers. In our
study, the majority of participants had Medicaid, which cov-
ers nicotine replacement therapy. Our study is also limited by
the fact that we cannot discern the relative contribution of
the intervention components. Given that 81% of participants
in the intervention arm who quit smoking at 12 months re-
ceived the minimum navigation intervention dose, we be-
lievethatthenavigationcomponentwasnecessary.Atthesame
time, we suspect that navigation alone would have been in-
sufficient to achieve the smoking cessation rates we ob-
served. Patient navigation has been shown to help patients
achieve discrete, short-term behavior change (eg, complet-
ing a colonoscopy)16 yet may be less effective in promoting
complex behavior change as is required to quit smoking. This
study also had a number of strengths. These included use of
biochemical verification of self-reported abstinence and tar-
geting a population of primary care smokers who were not al-
readyintreatment,hencetestingtheinterventiononabroader,
non–treatment-seeking population of smokers.

 Conclusions
This study shows that smoking cessation rates among adult
daily smokers at a safety-net hospital who received patient
navigation and financial incentives to quit smoking were sig-
nificantly higher than the rates among smokers who were
given program information but no navigation and financial
incentives. Future research should assess how the effective-
ness of this intervention can be maximized and how health
care systems can implement patient navigation and incen-
tives into primary care.40,41
