Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary heart disease (CHD), are epidemic in India. The Registrar
General of India reported that CHD led to 17% of total deaths and 26% of adult deaths in 2001-2003,
which increased to 23% of total and 32% of adult deaths in 2010-2013. The World Health Organization
(WHO) and Global Burden of Disease Study also have highlighted increasing trends in years of life lost
(YLLs) and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) from CHD in India. In India, studies have reported
increasing CHD prevalence over the last 60 years, from 1% to 9%-10% in urban populations and <1% to
4%-6% in rural populations. Using more stringent criteria (clinical � Q waves), the prevalence varies from
1%-2% in rural populations and 2%-4% in urban populations. This may be a more realistic prevalence of
CHD in India. Case-control studies have reported that important risk factors for CHD in India are dysli-
pidemias, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, abdominal obesity, psychosocial stress, unhealthy diet, and
physical inactivity. Suitable preventive strategies are required to combat this epidemic.

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), especially coronary
heart disease (CHD), have assumed epidemic pro-
portions worldwide. Globally, CVD led to 17.5 mil-
lion deaths in 2012.1 More than 75% of these
deaths occurred in developing countries. In contrast
to developed countries, where mortality from CHD
is rapidly declining, it is increasing in developing
countries.2 This increase is driven by industrializa-
tion, urbanization, and related lifestyle changes
and is called epidemiological transition.3 This tran-
sition affected the developed world, including coun-
tries of Europe and North America, in the early
20th century and spread to developing countries
50 years later.4 Epidemiological transition is divided
into 5 stages: (1) age of pestilence and famines,
marked by malnutrition, infectious diseases, and
high infant and childhood mortality with low mor-
tality from CVD (<10%); (2) age of receding pan-
demics, when better public health systems lead to
decreased mortality from communicable diseases
and emergence of CVD as important, with 10%-
35% mortality; (3) age of degenerative and human-
made diseases is characterized by mortality from
CVD surpassing mortality from communicable dis-
eases and leading to 35%-65% of all deaths; (4) age
of delayed degenerative diseases, when cancer and
CVDs are predominant causes of deaths and
CVD leads to >40% of all deaths but there is a
declining trend in death rates; and (5) age of inactiv-
ity and obesity, when declining physical activity leads
to epidemics of diabetes, hypertension, and lipid
abnormalities, with increasing CVD deaths rates.3

 India is a large and socioeconomically diverse
country, and there could be evidence of all the
stages of this transition in the country.5 How-
ever, this has not been studied. Other striking
features of CVD epidemiology in India are
high
mortality
rates,
premature
CHD,
and
increasing burden.6 In this article, we review
the current status of CHD mortality in India
using data from the Registrar General of India
(RGI),7,8

World
Health
Organization

reports. RGI data have been used to demonstrate
geographic variability in CHD mortality and evi-
dence of epidemiological transition. We have also
updated our previous reports on the prevalence of
CHD in India.11,12 Finally, we focus briefly on
risk factors, conventional and emerging, that are
considered important in the pathophysiology of
CHD in India.

We performed a systematic search of CHD mortal-
ity and epidemiological studies in India. We
obtained RGI data available at a government web-
site.7,8 WHO data are available in a report on
NCDs,1 and data from the GBD study were
obtained from their website.10 We searched the
PubMed database for additional data sources. The
initial search term “heart disease India” yielded
11,103 citations. An alternative search with “heart
disease epidemiology India” yielded 2314 citations,
and “coronary heart disease epidemiology India”
had 1267 results. Searches using the term “coronary
heart disease prevalence India” produced 1261 cita-
tions. We manually read all the titles and removed
duplicates and small studies and included 45 studies
for further evaluation. The inclusion criteria for the
studies were: studies performed since 1965, when
the first study using WHO criteria was per-
formed13; studies that included men and women
�20 years old; sample size of at least 500; and stud-
ies where clinical diagnosis as well as electrocardio-
graphic findings were reported. All these reports
were manually reviewed for content. Additional
studies were identified using hand search or review
of journals that traditionally publish CHD epide-
miological studies from India including studies
from our previous reports. Descriptive statistics are
reported.

The office of the RGI has periodically reported data
on cardiovascular mortality rates in India.7 These
data have been summarized as circulatory system
deaths in the Medical Certification of Cause of
Deaths reports, and in 1980s and 1990s it was
reported that CVD led to 15%-20% of deaths in
the country.14 An increasing trend in proportionate
CVD mortality has been reported, with 20.6%
deaths in 1990, 21.4% in 1995, 24.3% in 2000,
27.5% in 2005, and 29.0% in 2013.7 However,
these reports were based on incomplete data (mainly
rural health surveys) from which national data were
extrapolated. The Million Death Study Group in
collaboration with RGI reported deaths for the
year 2001-2003 using a validated verbal autopsy
instrument.15 This study used the existing sample
registration surveys of the Indian government and
evaluated more than 120,000 death reports obtained
from 661 districts of the country using a nationally
representative sample of more than 6 million partic-
ipants. CVD emerged as the most important cause
of death in men and women, in urban and rural
populations, and in developed and developing states
of the country.15 In India, more than 10.5 million
deaths occur annually, and it was reported that
CVD led to 20.3% of these deaths in men and
16.9% of all deaths in women.15 According to
2010-2013 RGI data,8 proportionate mortality
from CVD increased to 23% of total and 32% of
adult deaths in years 2010-2013. The mortality
varies from <10% in rural locations in less devel-
oped states to >35% in more developed urban loca-
tions.10 Geographic distribution of CVD mortality
in India indicates that in less developed regions,
such as the eastern and northeastern states with
low Human Development indices, there is lower
proportionate mortality compared with better devel-
oped states in southern and western regions (Fig. 1).
There is a linear relationship of increasing propor-
tionate
CVD
mortality
with
regional
Human
Development Index, which confirms the presence
of the epidemiological transition introduced ear-
lier.3,4 The RGI data do not classify CVD into
CHD, stroke, and other vascular causes of deaths,
however, and this is a limitation.
The WHO reported that in 2010, noncommuni-
cable diseases led to 5.87 million deaths globally and
in India led to 1.2 million deaths in men and 0.9
million deaths in women.1 These numbers are
much more than in any other country in the world
except China. According to the WHO, the South

 Asian region has one of the highest cardiovascular
mortality rates in the world.1 Age-adjusted CVD
mortality rates in countries of this region vary
from a low of 179/100,000 in men and 153/
100,000 among women in Bangladesh to a high
of 349/100,000 among men in India and 294/
100,000 in women in Pakistan. In India the
age-adjusted CVD mortality rates are 349/100,000
in men and 265/100,000 in women. These rates
are >2-3 times greater than in the United States,
where rates are 170/100,000 in men and 108/
100,000 in women.1
The GBD study has reported that deaths as well
as disability from CHD have more than doubled in
India in the last 30 years.16 The absolute number of
persons dying from CHD increased from 0.62 mil-
lion in 1990 to 0.78 million in 1995, 0.95 million in
2000, 1.01 million in 2005, and 1.13 million in
2010.9
The
proportions
of
years
of
life
lost
(YLLs) as a result of CVD was 5.1% in 1990 and
9.8% in 2010, whereas YLLs from CHD doubled
from 3.3% in 1990 to 6.7% in 2010.16 The GBD
study also provides YLLs from individuals dying
from CHD in India.10 Accordingly, in 1990 the
YLLs as a result of CVD were 5.1% of the total
and increased to 9.8% in 2010, whereas YLLs as a
result of CHD were 3.3% and doubled to 6.7% in
2010.10 YLLs are a reflection of premature mortal-
ity from a particular disease. In India and other
developing
countries,
premature
occurrence
of
CHD is a concern.2 High premature mortality
from CVD has been reported in the Million Death
Study.17 It was reported that in 2010, out of a total
of 1.89 million annual deaths, 0.59 million (31%)
occurred at age <60 years and 1.09 million (58%)
at age <70 years.
Only a few prospective studies have evaluated
CVD mortality rates in general populations in India;
all are regional and may not be nationally representa-
tive. They include the Andhra Pradesh Rural Health
Initiative (APRHI),18 the Kerala-based Population
Registry of Lifestyle Diseases (PROLIFE) study,19
the Mumbai Cohort Study (MCS),20 and the Pro-
spective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE)
study.21 In APRHI, 180,162 rural participants in
Andhra Pradesh were prospectively studied for inci-
dence of CVD mortality over 2 years. CVD mortality
rate was 255/100,000 in men and 225/100,000 in
women, and it emerged as the most important cause
of death.18 PROLIFE evaluated causes of deaths in
161,942 population based men and women over a
7-year period and reported death rates from CVD
in men (490/100,000) and women (231/100,000).19
Higher rates were reported in MCS where 148,713
adult men and women were prospectively studied
for 5 years with CVD mortality rate of 525/100,000
in men and 299/100,000 in women.20 The PURE
study reported cardiovascular mortality rates in
155,000 adult men and women (35-70 years) in 17
low-, middle-, and high-income countries.21 Low-
income countries (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and
Zimbabwe) had higher CVD mortality rates com-
pared with high- and middle-income countries.
Low-income countries (n ¼ 33,834) were predomi-
nantly represented by India (n ¼ 29,258). In low-
income countries the annual incidence of fatal CVD
was 4/1000, which was significantly greater than in
high-income countries. Case fatality rate was also sig-
nificantly greater in low-income countries (India),
with a hazard ratio of 2.30 compared with high-
income countries.21 Mortality was significantly
greater in rural areas than in the urban in the

 PURE study, in contrast to APRHI, PROLIFE, and
MCS studies.
Four factors contribute to high CVD mortality
in the South Asian region and India.22 These are:
(a) lack of policies related to social determinants
of CVD for control of primordial risk factors
(smoking, smokeless tobacco, alcohol, physical inac-
tivity, and unhealthy diet); (b) poor-quality preven-
tive managementdthat is, poor control of risk
factors (smoking, high blood pressure, high choles-
terol, obesity, and diabetes); (c) low availability and,
at times, substandard acute CHD management; and
(d) lack of appropriate long-term care of these
patients and absent cardiovascular rehabilitative
and secondary prevention programs. Unfortu-
nately, all these factors are widely prevalent in
India.6

Previous epidemiological studies on CHD preva-
lence in India used multiple criteria to diagnose
this condition.11,12 These included specific criteria
such as known CHD on treatment or evidence of
previous

(clinical
history
and/or electrocardiogram [ECG] Q waves), as

 well as less specific criteria such as Rose question-
naire positive angina, ST-segment changes, or
T-wave changes on ECG.23 Accordingly, a high
prevalence of CHD has been reported in the coun-
try, varying from 1%-2% in 1960s to 8%-10% in late
1990s.11 We reviewed CHD epidemiology studies
from 1960s to 1990s and reported that CHD prev-
alence in the country has increased 6- to 9-fold over
this period, more in urban than in rural popula-
tions.11,12 Large studies that have reported epidemi-
ology of CHD in India using clinical criteria
(known CHD) as well as more stringent criteria
(clinical history and/or ECG Q waves) are now
available (Table 1). Although diagnosis of CHD
using clinical criteria alone (known CHD) is likely
to lead to under-reporting of this condition, these
are used in the US-based National Health and
Nutrition Evaluation studies.52 Therefore, use of
clinical and more stringent criteria are desirable for
within-country and international comparisons.
We identified CHD epidemiological studies that
have reported its prevalence using the search strategy
reported earlier. We identified studies that used
clinical criteria alone (known angina or myocardial
infarction or on treatment) as well as studies that addi-
tionally used presence of ECG criteria (Q waves with
or without ST-T changes) for diagnosis (Table 1).
Using clinical criteria, older epidemiology studies
reported CHD in urban Indian locations in 1.5%-
4.0% of the population.13,24-35 Prevalence of CHD
was lower in rural locations at 0.5%-2%.36-45
National Family Health Surveys (NFHS) are
nationwide surveys of multiple social and health fac-
tors.53 The initial surveys, NFHS-1 and NFHS-2,
focused on maternal and child health and the burden
of communicable diseases. NFHS-3 (sample size
>190,000) has reported on some noncommunicable
disease risk factors such as overweight and obesity
and asked simple questions on prevalence of self-
reporteddiabetesandCHD.Minisculeratesofknown
CHD have been reportedd67 in 190,000.53 Simi-
larly, diabetes prevalence reported in NFHS-3 is a
gross underestimate, as discussed in a post-hoc analy-
sis.54 More intensive and better quality studies are
required. National Statistical Survey Organization
(NSSO)surveysare population-based nationwiderep-
resentative studies on multiple social and health
parameters. The 60th round of NSSO survey, con-
ducted in 2004-2005, was focused on health status,
health careeseeking behaviors, health care utilization,
and health economics. In this round, 47,302 rural and
26,566urban households were surveyed and involveda
population of 390,913 participants. Hospitalizations
for CHD or confirmed diagnosis using clinicalcriteria,
ECG changes, and prescription review in this survey
were reported in 10% of urban participants and 4%
of rural participants, with an average prevalence rate
of 6.0%.46
Only a few nationwide studies that have evaluated
prevalence of known CHD are available (Table 1).
These
include
the
India
Migration
Study
(1.45%),47 India Heart Watch (2.55%),48 and
PURE (2.04%)49 study. A risk factor surveillance
study in Kerala reported known CHD in 1.7%,50
and a multisite study in Kerala reported definite
CHD in 3.5%.51 Thus, known CHD in these studies
vary from 2%-4%, and this may be a more realistic
prevalence of CHD in the general population in
India. Similar criteria are used in most of the surveys
in developed countries, and therefore these results are
directly comparable. However, all these studies suffer
from multiple limitations and biases, and larger and
more inclusive national studies are required. NFHS
obtains data periodically from a representative
national sample and could be a good source. On the
other hand, large national surveys such as sample
registration survey studies, NSSO surveys, and Cen-
sus of India data could include questions on CHD
and other NCDs. Such periodic surveys would not
only help in obtaining representative data but would
also identify trends and association of CHD with var-
ious social determinants of health and should be a
national priority.55
The GBD study has reported data on disease
burden
using
disability-adjusted
life
years
(DALYs).9,10 DALYs as a result of ischemic heart
disease in India were 15.8 million in 1990, 19.6 mil-
lion in 1995, 22.7 million in 2000, 24.4 million in
2005, and 26.2 million in 2010 (P < .01 for
trend).10 Elsewhere, this study has reported that
the overall prevalence of CHD appears to be declin-
ing (Fig. 2).10 This appears counterintuitive and not
in line with the data on DALYs and prevalence
rates shown in Table 1. The GBD group may
have adopted data from the studies that have
reported CHD prevalence using less stringent crite-
ria for diagnosis. More intensive data analysis is
required to exactly determine trends of CHD prev-
alence in India to resolve this discrepancy.
R I S K F A C T O R S
There are no prospective studies in India that have
determined factors of risk for CHD.6 Risk factors
for premature CHD have been quantified in the
case-control

 INTERHEART study, 8 common risk factors
explained >90% of incident
acute

infarctions in South Asian and Indian patients.57
The risk factors include dyslipidemia (high apolipo-
protein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio), smoking or
tobacco use, known hypertension, known diabetes,
abdominal obesity, physical inactivity, low fruits
and vegetables intake, and psychosocial stress.
World Health Statistics has reported the prevalence
of major CVD risk factors in India.58 Prevalence of
risk factors in men and women, respectively, were
smoking or use of any tobacco product in 22.8%
and 2.4%, obesity in adults 3.2% and 6.7%, high
blood pressure in 25.9% and 24.8%, and diabetes
in 9.7% and 9.2%. Reviews from India have
reported
that
all
these
risk
factorsdobesity,
abdominal obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and
diabetesdare increasing.6,12 Unhealthy lifestyles
such as smoking, nonsmoked tobacco use, sedentary
lifestyles, low fruits and vegetables diet, high dietary
saturated fat and trans fat intake, and alcohol abuse
are also widely prevalent.6 However, these reviews
are based on small regional studies in urban, rural,
or both populations, and there is a need for nation-
ally representative data.
An important change in risk factor dynamics in
India is a more rapid increase in CVD risk factors
in rural and slum populations compared with urban
populations.59,60 Smoking and nonsmoked tobacco
continues to increase in rural and less literate popula-
tions, while it is declining in more educated urban
populations.59 The epidemic of sedentariness has
penetrated rural households with rapidly increasing
use of labor-saving technologies.61 Dietary habits
have undergone a see change with greater consump-
tion of fats, saturated fats, trans fats, and processed
foods.62 Calorie-dense fast foods (comfort foods)
are easily available and both Indian-style and

are
being
consumed
widely.62 There is an urban-rural convergence in
hypertension prevalence in India.60 Review of hyper-
tension epidemiology studies over the last 20 years
(1995-2015) indicates that although its prevalence
has stabilized at 28%-32% in urban populations, in
rural populations it has increased from 10%-12% in
1990s
to 22%-25% presently.
Similarly,
serial
NFHS studies have reported a more rapid increase
in obesity in Indian rural populations than in urban
populations.63 These are surrogates for increasing
abdominal obesity and other cardiometabolic risk fac-
tors among the rural populations in India. This por-
tends a further escalation of CHD epidemic in India.
Other Risk Factors. A number of case-control studies
have reported that abnormalities of lipids other than
low-density lipoprotein cholesterol may be important
in Indians.6 These lipoprotein lipids include low high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol and high triglycerides,
very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol metabolites,
lipoprotein remnants, and lipoprotein (a). However,
there is no prospective or large case-control study
evidence. Similarly, thrombotic risk factors such as
high fibrinogen, hyperhomocysteinemia, and abnor-
mal platelet aggregability have been reported as
important in small case-control studies,64 but there are
no large studies.
Genetic factors have been implicated in patho-
genesis of premature atherosclerosis in Indians.
However, in the INTERHEART study, genetic fac-
tors explained <2% incident acute myocardial infarc-
tions.65 Large-scale, consortia-based, genome-wide
association studies in the United Kingdom, the
United States, and Europe have reported that 45
genes are important in CHD.66 The odds ratios
vary from 1.1-1.3 in these association studies with
small effect sizes. More important among them are
SORT1, MIA3, PCSK9, WDR12, MRAS, PHAC-
TRI1, ANRIL, CDKN2A, CDKN2B, CXCL12,
ATXN2,
SH2BS,
PTPN11,
LDLR,
SLC5A3,
MRPS6, and KCNE2 genes. Of these, 15 genes are
significant for both stroke and CHD and include
SH2B3 and ABO in chromosome 12q24, HDAC9,
9p21, RAI1, PEMT, RASD1, EDNRA, CYP17A1,
CNNM2, NT5C2, ADAMTS, and ABO genes.67
C4D Genetics Consortium identified certain novel
genes in South Asians for coronary artery disease,
namely, LIPA at chromosome 10q23, PDGFD on
11q22, ADAMTS7-MORF4L1 on 15q25, a gene-
rich locus on 7q22, and KIAA1462 on 10p11.68
Large case-control and prospective studies are
required to assess the role of genetic factors in
CHD in India. Also required are studies focusing
on epigenetic mechanisms and gene-environment
interactions.
C O N C L U S I O N S
Review of cardiovascular epidemiology studies in
India indicates that this has become an important
public health problem in India. CHD is one of
the most important causes of mortality and morbid-
ity in the country. It also leads to massive economic
burden. It has been determined that return on
investment of interventions to promote healthy liv-
ing and to prevent, treat, and manage CHD in
India is cost effective.69 There is an urgent need
to promote primordial, primary, and secondary pre-
vention strategies. Primordial strategies such as pro-
motion
of
smoking/tobacco
cessation,
physical
activity, and healthy dietary habits should prevent
risk factors from occurring in the first place. Primary
prevention should focus on screening and better
control of risk factors (hypertension, hypercholester-
olemia, and diabetes) to prevent incidence of overt
CHD. Good quality secondary prevention and bet-
ter management of acute and chronic events will
prevent premature mortality and morbidity.
