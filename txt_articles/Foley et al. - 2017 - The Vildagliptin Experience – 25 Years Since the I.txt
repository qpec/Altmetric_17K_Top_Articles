T
he discovery of the incretin hormone glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and its usefulness in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus 
(T2DM) followed by the finding that dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibition prevents GLP-1 inactivation, led to the discovery of 
DPP-728. In 1999, studies with DPP-728 established the first proof-of-concept that DPP-4 inhibition improves glycaemic control in 
patients with T2DM. Further efforts to improve the binding kinetics of DPP-728 resulted in the discovery of vildagliptin (LAF237). In the last 20 
years, a plethora of studies conducted by Novartis in collaboration with external investigators has demonstrated the mechanism of action 
of vildagliptin and its efficacy as monotherapy and as an add-on therapy for patients with T2DM. The studies establish that vildagliptin is a 
selective DPP-4 inhibitor that blocks GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) inactivation, thereby prolonging their 
action, resulting in improved glycaemic control. This review aims to discuss the discovery and development of vildagliptin, with an emphasis 
on mechanism of action and clinical efficacy.

Prior to the launch of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors 10 years ago, there were no 
oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) that 
targeted deficient glucose regulation during both hyperglycaemia and hypoglycaemia.1 As the 
Sandoz/Novartis DPP-4 program was central for the development of the DPP-4 inhibitor class, 
we thought it relevant to share our reminiscences of the discovery, development and clinical 
profiling of vildagliptin.
In 1990, only 7 years after the discovery of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)2 and 3 years after 
the discovery of GLP-1 as a physiological incretin hormone in humans,3 a research group in 
Sweden showed that GLP-1 infusions were useful in the treatment of T2DM.4 At the same time, 
a drug discovery team led by James E Foley at Sandoz in New Jersey, US had settled on two 
major therapeutic goals: inhibition of hepatic glucose production (HGP) without the side effects of 
metformin, and improved insulin secretion without hypoglycaemia associated with sulphonylureas 
(SUs). The therapeutic goal to improve upon SUs was assigned to Beth Dunning, who had recently 
joined the Sandoz group from postdoctoral work in Dan Porte’s laboratory. It was serendipity that 
Beth Dunning and Bo Ahrén had shared an office in Seattle in 1984–5. In 1990, at the European 
Association for the Study of Diabetes in Copenhagen, Dunning, Ahrén and Foley, discussed how 
GLP-1 could be utilised therapeutically; this marked the beginning of 25 years of collaboration 
between Bo Ahrén and Sandoz, which became Novartis 20 years ago (personal communication, 
James E Foley, Copenhagen, 1990).
Discovery
In our early discussions of how to approach a GLP-1-based therapy, the Sandoz discovery team ruled 
out a peptide approach (to our lasting dismay), despite Sandoz’s extensive peptide experience with 
calcitonin and sandostatin (personal communication, James E Foley, New Jersey, 1991). For almost 
2 years, Sandoz chemists and biochemists attempted to make a non-peptide mimetic and then, in 
1993, it was reported from Germany that GLP-1 was degraded solely by the enzyme DPP-4.5 Our 
lead chemist at that time, Bob Anderson, then suggested that the physiological rise in GLP-1 levels 
could be enhanced through inhibiting its inactivation by DPP-4. The five N-terminal amino acids 
of GLP-1 (the part of the peptide acted on by DPP-4) are identical to those of glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), the other known incretin hormone; therefore, the inhibition of 
DPP-4 was also predicted to enhance post-meal GIP levels even though at the time, most of the 
interest was in the benefits of GLP-1 (personal communication, James E Foley, New Jersey, 1995).

EUROPEAN ENDOCRINOLOGY
These findings created a possibility of developing an orally active DPP-4 
inhibitor to leverage the increasing usefulness of the incretin hormones 
as anti-diabetes therapy.
In early 1995, it was reported that the inhibition of DPP-4 raised GLP-
1 levels in vitro.6 Within weeks, Ed Villhauer went through the Sandoz 
chemical library and identified a molecule called valine pyrrolidide, an 
orally active DPP-4 inhibitor which had been identified by the Sandoz 
immunology group. The team then demonstrated that valine pyrrolidide 
lowered blood glucose levels in rodents (Figure 1A)7 and non-human 
primates (Figure 1B).8
Novartis provided valine pyrrolidide to Bo Ahrén and Jens Holst 
laboratories to further characterise DPP-4 inhibition in animal models. 
These valine pyrrolidide studies demonstrated that DPP-4 inhibition 
potentiated the insulinotropic actions of both GLP-1 and GIP in pigs9,10 
and reduced glycaemia and augmented insulinaemia after oral glucose 
in mice.11
Thomas Hughes and associates developed assays for DPP-4 as well 
as for closely related enzymes that were compatible with utilisation 
of combinatorial chemistry techniques to test more than a thousand 
substitutions to valine pyrrolidide, resulting in the discovery of DPP-728 
in 1996.12 By 1999, DPP-728 was evaluated in patients, which provided 
the first human proof-of-concept that a DPP-4 inhibitor could improve 
glycaemic control in patients with T2DM.13
In 1996, kinetic studies revealed that DPP-728 was a substrate for the 
DPP-4 catalytic site with a slow dissociation rate rather than a simple 
competitive inhibitor. Engineering of the DPP-728 structure by Ed 
Villhauer and colleagues to attenuate the dissociation rate further led 
to the discovery of vildagliptin in 1998. The ‘vil’ in vildagliptin was in 
recognition of Ed Villhauer’s contribution.14,15
Vildagliptin mechanism
DPP-4 is a large protein with a small catalytic site that inactivates 
GLP-1 and GIP by cleaving the peptides after the second amino acid 
from the N-terminal end. Vildagliptin effectively competes with GLP-1 
and GIP to enter the catalytic site of DPP-4. Vildagliptin’s nitrile group 
rapidly forms a covalent bond, stabilising vildagliptin in the catalytic 
site of DPP-4. The dissociation of inactive vildagliptin from the catalytic 
site occurs slowly, with a half-life of about an hour. While vildagliptin is 
covalently bound, DPP-4 cannot degrade any other substrate. Following 
dissociation of inactive vildagliptin, another vildagliptin molecule will 
compete with GLP-1 and GIP to enter the catalytic site. This results in 
complete blocking of DPP-4 activity over the entire time that vildagliptin 
levels are adequate (≥50 nM) to effectively compete with GLP-1 and GIP
.16 
Therefore, the primary pharmacology of vildagliptin is prolonging meal-
induced increases in GLP-1 and GIP
. Interestingly, early in the programme, 
our hypothesis was that the increase in GLP-1 levels at the beginning 
of a meal is responsible for pancreatic and extra-pancreatic effects, 
which we characterised as secondary pharmacological actions of DPP-4 
inhibitors.1 However, in collaboration with Ralph DeFronzo’s group, further 
investigation led us to conclude that it was rather the prolongation of 
meal-induced increases in GLP-1 and GIP that results in these secondary 
pharmacological actions.1,17,18
The mechanistic studies utilising valine pyrrolidide were reconfirmed 
with vildagliptin and, in particular, it was shown that vildagliptin improved 
glycaemia and augmented insulin secretion after oral glucose in obese 
Zucker rats,19 as well as in normal and high-fat diet-fed mice.20 A study 
in mice with gene deletions for GLP-1 and GIP receptors showed that 
vildagliptin had no effect, which supported the hypothesis that the 
incretin hormones were responsible for improved glycaemia and 
insulinaemia.21 These preclinical studies showed that vildagliptin had the 
expected effects for a DPP-4 inhibitor on glucose and insulin levels and 
that these effects were achieved through the incretin hormones.
Over the last 12 years, further clinical profiling studies showed that 
vildagliptin therapy increases the sensitivity of pancreatic islet α- and 
β-cells to glucose. These effects result in increased insulin secretion and 
decreased glucagon secretion, pronounced in hyperglycaemic states, 
and reduced insulin secretion and increased glucagon secretion during 
hypoglycaemia.22 Additionally, mobilisation and burning of fat during 
meals, a decreased gut secretion of apolipoprotein B-48 (apo B-48), a 
reduction of fasting lipolysis and liver fat and an increase in particle 
 
size of low-density lipoprotein are the secondary pharmacological 
effects of vildagliptin.1,16
These pancreatic and extra-pancreatic effects result in reductions of 
postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) 
levels, leading to reduced glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels with no 
increase in the risk for hypoglycaemia or weight gain.1,16 The reductions 
in FPG associated with vildagliptin include reductions in Cori cycling 
secondary to decreased PPG levels as well as direct effects on overnight 
HGP
.23 The glucose-lowering action of vildagliptin is attributable to the 
effects of GLP-1 and GIP and the effects on α- and β-cells appear to be 
equally important.1,24
Our original hypothesis was that the absence of an increase in insulin 
and decrease in glucagon during euglycaemic and hypoglycaemic states 
explains not just a lack of an increase in hypoglycaemia in the face of 
reduced glucose levels, but even a reduction in hypoglycaemic events in 
patients on insulin therapy. We later found that the sensitivity of β-cells 
to glucose extended into the hypoglycaemic range.25 Furthermore, since 
GIP was mirroring the extension of meal-induced GLP-1 levels and GIP

had been reported to increase the sensitivity of α-cells to glucose in the 
hypoglycaemic range, we hypothesised that reduced insulin secretion 
and increased glucagon levels during hypoglycaemia brought about by 
DPP-4 inhibition with vildagliptin resulted in better counter-regulation, 
which likely explains the apparent protection against hypoglycaemia 
observed when vildagliptin is added to insulin therapy.26
Insulin resistance can be a result of glucose toxicity, inappropriately 
elevated glucagon levels and lipotoxicity. All hypoglycaemic agents, 
to the extent that they reduce FPG, reduce glucotoxicity, and all GLP-1 
based therapies reduce inappropriately elevated glucagon levels. 
Vildagliptin inhibits fasting lipolysis, which should redistribute fat storage 
from non-fat tissues to fat cells; observations of 25% reductions in 
liver fat associated with vildagliptin treatment are consistent with this 
expected redistribution. Vildagliptin-induced reduction in liver fat is, in 
turn, consistent with a reduction in lipotoxicity as evidenced by increased 
glucose utilisation under conditions where lipogenesis is the presumed 
rate-limiting step.1
The GLP-1 receptor agonists produce a vital effect by their direct action 
on the brain stem which delays gastric emptying and promotes satiety, 
but such an effect is not seen with DPP-4 inhibitors as DPP-4 inhibition 
do not result in high enough levels of GLP-1 to produce direct action on 
the brain stem.1,16 Vildagliptin did not show significant effect on gastric 
emptying after a single dose27 or after 8 days of treatment.28 However, a 
single dose study utilising high-resolution scintigraphy reported a small 
significant delay in gastric emptying with vildagliptin.29 It is likely that this 
small effect was not large enough to be detected by techniques precise 
enough for clinical relevance, but is of scientific interest. Furthermore, 
the low hypoglycaemic potential of DPP-4 inhibitors prevents the weight 
gain associated with ‘defensive eating’ in order to avoid hypoglycaemia. 
Unexpectedly, DPP-4 inhibitors do not lead to weight gain despite the 
caloric penalty related to reduction of glucose levels from above to below 
the renal threshold. Potential mechanisms that may account for these 
lost calories are the mobilisation and burning of fat during meals and the 
reduction in apo B-48 secretion, leading to decreased fat extraction from 
the gut.1,16 In addition, a largely unexplored aspect is how variations in 
diet may influence the glucose-lowering potential of DPP-4 inhibitors. In a 
recent study, it was shown that a whey preload can markedly potentiate 
the glucose-lowering effect of vildagliptin by enhancing endogenous 
GLP-1 secretion.30
Efficacy
The vildagliptin clinical registration programme began in 2002 and 
ended in 2006 with new drug application submissions in several 
countries. David Holmes and Anja Schweizer, among others at 
Novartis, were instrumental in designing and managing the ongoing 
studies along with data analysis in collaboration with external 
investigators. In 2002–3, vildagliptin was tested in patients for the first 
time by Bo Ahrén and collaborators. In a 4-week study, vildagliptin 
was effective in lowering HbA1c in drug-naive patients by 0.4% from 
a baseline of 7.1–7.2%.31 This study also confirmed higher GLP-1 levels 
and enhanced β-cell function (insulin levels were maintained at lower 
glucose levels) in humans, which had been previously demonstrated 
in animals with valine pyrrolidide, DPP-728 and vildagliptin. The study 
also demonstrated that glucagon levels decreases during meals in 
humans, a parameter that had not been evaluated in animals with 
DPP-4 inhibitors.31 
Bo Ahrén and collaborators then evaluated the efficacy of vildagliptin 
(50 mg once daily) in patients on metformin with inadequate glycaemic 
control, showing a between-treatment difference (vildagliptin versus 
placebo) in the adjusted mean change (AM∆) in HbA1c of -1.1% after 
52 weeks of treatment from a baseline of ~7.7% (Figure 2A).32 This 
improvement in glycaemic control could be ascribed to both enhanced 
insulin secretion (Figure 2B) and reduced demand for insulin as reflected 
by increased insulin sensitivity (Figure 2C) demonstrated using the 
standard meal test.33
These studies were followed by many larger multicentre studies which 
included more than 17,000 patients.34 It is not possible to cover all the 
studies and associated indications; here, we highlight some of the 
studies of vildagliptin as monotherapy, as an add-on to metformin, and 
an add-on to insulin, that not only supported registration but also were 
important in our understanding of its mechanism.
Overall, vildagliptin monotherapy studies provided evidence that 
treatment with vildagliptin results in consistent and clinically meaningful 
reductions in HbA1c from baseline levels, without weight gain and with 
minimal hypoglycaemia.23 The relationship between baseline HbA1c 
and the drop from baseline HbA1c along with changes in weight from 
baseline can be best viewed when the data are pooled: with vildagliptin-
treatment, mean ∆HbA1c was -2.1% from a baseline of 10.6%, -1.8% 
from 9.5%, -1.2% from 8.5%, -0.7% from 7.7% and -0.5% from 6.9%.35
When glucose levels exceed the renal threshold (i.e., the level of 
glucose above which sodium-glucose cotransporters in the kidneys 
fail to reabsorb all the available glucose), glucose spills into the urine. 
Any therapy that reduces glucose levels from above the renal threshold 
to below it mitigates caloric loss and thus can lead to weight gain.36 
However, when vildagliptin monotherapy data were pooled, there was 
an average ~0.5 kg weight loss; weight loss was greatest in patients

with glycaemic levels below the renal threshold and there was no 
weight loss at the renal threshold.37,38 This modest degree of weight loss 
was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure 
 
(-2.7 mmHg from a baseline of 132.5 mmHg) and diastolic blood pressure 
(-1.6 mmHg from a baseline of 81.2 mmHg) and a favourable fasting 
lipid profile that included a decrease of 0.2 mmol/L from a baseline of 
2.0 mmol/L in triglycerides.38
Among the vildagliptin monotherapy studies, the most illuminating was 
the 1-year, placebo-controlled study involving 306 drug-naive T2DM 
patients with mild hyperglycaemia (mean HbA1c of 6.7%). Patients 
randomised to the group receiving vildagliptin 50 mg once daily plus 
lifestyle counselling showed a significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.3%) after 
52 weeks compared with those receiving placebo along with lifestyle 
counselling. A 1-year extension (total study duration 2 years) showed 
continued improvement with vildagliptin compared with placebo, with 
a placebo-adjusted change in HbA1c of -0.5% from the core study 
baseline after 2 years. Body weight decreased significantly in vildagliptin-
treated patients (-1.1 kg versus -0.3 kg with placebo), and two patients 
(3.2%) treated with placebo versus none (0.0%) receiving vildagliptin 
experienced hypoglycaemia. Taken together, 2 years of treatment with 
vildagliptin mitigated the progressive loss of glycaemic control that 
was observed in patients with mild hyperglycaemia receiving placebo 
and lifestyle counselling, without exposing them to hypoglycaemia or 
weight gain. This appears to result from a corresponding attenuation 
of the deterioration of β-cell function as assessed by the insulin 
 
secretion rate relative to glucose over a period of 2 years.39
There were several very crucial phase III studies examining vildagliptin 
as add-on therapy in patients inadequately controlled on metformin. 
In a dose-response study in which baseline HbA1c averaged 8.3%, the 
between-group difference in HbA1c (vildagliptin versus placebo) was 
-0.7% and -1.1% in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg once daily 
and twice daily, respectively (Figure 3A). There were also substantial 
and dose-related decreases in FPG (-0.8 mmol/L and -1.7 mmol/L 
with vildagliptin 50 mg once daily and twice daily) (Figure 3B). The 
standard breakfast meal tests at weeks 0 and 24 were performed in a 
subset of patients which demonstrated a significant reduction in PPG 
and improved β-cell function (insulin secretion adjusted for glucose, 
defined as 2-hour glucose area under the curve [AUC0–2h] divided by 
AUC0–2h for the insulin secretory rate (ISR). There was a lack of dose 
response on these parameters, as the study drug was administered 
30 minutes prior to the breakfast meal tests in both treatment groups. 
The difference in HbA1c between the two vildagliptin dose regimens 
may be due to twice the reduction of FPG levels with higher daily dose 
of vildagliptin.17,40
A 52-week phase III study compared vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily 
to pioglitazone 30 mg once daily as an add-on therapy in patients 
inadequately treated with metformin.41 An interim analysis42 performed 
after 24 weeks of treatment showed that the efficacy of vildagliptin 
was non-inferior to that of pioglitazone (AM∆ HbA1c=-0.9% versus 
-1.0%, respectively). Pioglitazone produced a larger decrease in FPG 
 
(AM∆= -2.1 mmol/L) as compared with vildagliptin (AM∆=-1.4 mmol/L); 
presumably the PPG control was better in the vildagliptin group. 
Additionally, there was significant weight gain seen only in the pioglitazone 
group (AM∆=+1.9 kg). The 52-week data revealed a modest loss in 
glycaemic control in both the treatment groups such that the change 
 
in HbA1c from baseline (8.4% in both groups) at week 52 was -0.6%, 
 
both in patients receiving vildagliptin 50 mg twice daily or pioglitazone 
 
30 mg once daily added to metformin. After 52 weeks of treatment, mean 
body weight increased significantly in the pioglitazone group (+2.6 kg), 
but not in the vildagliptin group (+0.2 kg).41 
In a 2-year non-inferiority study comparing vildagliptin (50 mg twice 
daily) to glimepiride (up to 6 mg/day) in patients with T2DM inadequately 
controlled with metformin monotherapy, an interim analysis performed 
after 52 weeks of treatment demonstrated that vildagliptin was non-
inferior to glimepiride in patients with low baseline HbA1c (mean=7.3%). 
The most notable differences between vildagliptin and glimepiride in 
this study were weight gain with glimepiride (AM∆=+1.6 kg), vildagliptin 
(AM∆=-0.2 kg), and a 10-fold higher number of hypoglycaemic 
episodes with glimepiride (554 events, 10 severe) than with vildagliptin 
 
(39 events, 0 severe).43
Two-year data from this study showed deterioration of glycaemic control 
for both vildagliptin and glimepiride, even though the initial response 
was sustained significantly longer with vildagliptin, as reflected by the 
‘coefficient of failure’: from week 24 to week 104, HbA1c increased 
at a rate of 0.4% per year with vildagliptin versus 0.5% per year with 
glimepiride (p=0.008). This suggests that deterioration of glycaemic 
control was worse with the sulphonylurea than with vildagliptin, which 
is consistent with the finding that insulin resistance, as assessed by 
the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), 
worsened from baseline to week 104 with both treatments, but the 
increase with glimepiride was significantly greater than with vildagliptin. 
Interestingly, although the prandial glucose excursion (glucose AUC0–2h) 
showed a similar decrease in patients receiving vildagliptin as in 
those receiving glimepiride, prandial insulin levels increased to a 
greater extent with glimepiride, while prandial glucagon secretion was 
suppressed with vildagliptin. The differences in body weight between 
vildagliptin and glimepiride as an add-on to metformin were maintained

throughout the 2-year study, as were the differences in the frequency 
and severity of hypoglycaemia.44
Higher rates of hypoglycaemia in the glimepiride group were not due 
to higher doses of glimepiride; hypoglycaemia was more pronounced 
at 2 mg dose than 6 mg dose, suggesting interesting differences among 
patients regarding the susceptibility to hypoglycaemia with SUs.45 
In another non-inferiority trial of vildagliptin versus gliclazide as an add-
on to metformin in patients with a higher baseline HbA1c (mean=8.5%), 
vildagliptin was found to be non-inferior to gliclazide, with respect to 
reductions in both HbA1c and FPG.46 However, there was little difference 
in weight gain or hypoglycaemia. A study reveals that the decrease in 
HbA1c from baseline with SU treatment is smaller in real-world setting 
when compared to randomised controlled trials (RCTs), whereas the 
decrease in HbA1c with vildagliptin is essentially similar (Figure 4), 
indicating that the doses of SUs are not adequately increased possibly 
due to fear of hypoglycaemia and weight gain.47
Although previous studies showed that vildagliptin 50 mg twice 
 
daily was more efficacious than vildagliptin 50 mg once daily when 
added to metformin, this was not the case when vildagliptin was 
added in the same manner to a SU.48 Our hypothesis is that the 
complementary mechanisms of vildagliptin added to metformin 
therapy could further correct inappropriate overnight HGP while the 
similar mechanisms of vildagliptin as an add-on to SU therapy could 
not produce the same effect.
Three different studies demonstrated the effectiveness of vildagliptin 
in combination with insulin with and without concomitant metformin 
therapy where vildagliptin decreased HbA1c levels without increasing 
hypoglycaemia.26 These findings also suggest that vildagliptin is more 
effective when insulin is used as a basal regimen in contrast to being used 
to reduce postprandial hyperglycaemia. This is because improvement 
in insulin secretion likely plays a minor role when relatively high doses 
of insulin are administered before meals. Data from one of these three 
studies (Figure 5) show that the reduction in glucose levels was not 
associated with an increase in hypoglycaemia or an increase in weight 
secondary to defensive eating.26
Early in the development of incretin-based therapies, was the promise 
of an increase in β-cell mass. Vildagliptin demonstrated that in young 
rodents there was increased β-cell mass, but when vildagliptin was 
studied in a long-term animal study of adult rodents, there was no effect 
to increase β-cell mass.49 To date, there is no evidence that any GLP-1 
based therapy is associated with a disease-modifying effect to increase 
β-cell mass in humans.50 However, all data with vildagliptin are consistent 
with preserving function as well as correcting many of the underlying 
pathologies associated with T2DM.1,16,39 This is consistent with our findings 
that when all the data are pooled, neither insulin resistance, body mass 
index, disease duration nor duration of metformin use has an effect on 
the efficacy of vildagliptin.51
Concluding statement
Exploring the clinical utility of GLP-1 as a therapeutic approach for 
treatment of T2DM, marked the beginning of collaboration between 
 
Bo Ahrén and Sandoz, 25 years ago. Sandoz later became Novartis; 
further collaborative studies with investigators from the academic 
community led to the discovery, development and profiling of 
vildagliptin. These pioneering activities with vildagliptin over the last 
10 years were central to the establishment of DPP-4 inhibitors as a 
standard of care for the treatment of T2DM. ❑
