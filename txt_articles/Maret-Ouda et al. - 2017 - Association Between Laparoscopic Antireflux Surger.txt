IMPORTANCE Cohort studies, mainly based on questionnaires and interviews, have reported
high rates of reflux recurrence after antireflux surgery, which may have contributed to a
decline in its use. Reflux recurrence after laparoscopic antireflux surgery has not been
assessed in a long-term population-based study of unselected patients.
OBJECTIVES To determine the risk of reflux recurrence after laparoscopic antireflux surgery
and to identify risk factors for recurrence.
DESIGN AND SETTING Nationwide population-based retrospective cohort study in Sweden
between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2014, based on all Swedish health care and
including 2655 patients who underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery according to the
Swedish Patient Registry. Their records were linked to the Swedish Causes of Death Registry
and Prescribed Drug Registry.
EXPOSURES Primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery due to gastroesophageal reflux disease
in adults (>18 years).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The outcome was recurrence of reflux, defined as use of
antireflux medication (proton pump inhibitors or histamine2 receptor antagonists for >6
months) or secondary antireflux surgery. Multivariable Cox regression was used to assess risk
factors for reflux recurrence.
RESULTS Among all 2655 patients who underwent antireflux surgery (median age, 51.0 years;
interquartile range, 40.0-61.0 years; 1354 men [51.0%]) and were followed up for a median of
5.6 years, 470 patients (17.7%) had reflux recurrence; 393 (83.6%) received long-term
antireflux medication and 77 (16.4%) underwent secondary antireflux surgery. Risk factors for
reflux recurrence included female sex (hazard ratio [HR], 1.57 [95% CI, 1.29-1.90]; 286 of 1301
women [22.0%] and 184 of 1354 men [13.6%] had recurrence of reflux), older age (HR, 1.41
[95% CI, 1.10-1.81] for age �61 years compared with �45 years; recurrence among 156 of 715
patients and 133 of 989 patients, respectively), and comorbidity (HR, 1.36 [95% CI, 1.13-1.65]
for Charlson comorbidity index score �1 compared with 0; recurrence among 180 of 804
patients and 290 of 1851 patients, respectively). Hospital volume of antireflux surgery was
not associated with risk of reflux recurrence (HR, 1.09 [95% CI, 0.77-1.53] for hospital volume
�24 surgeries compared with �76 surgeries; recurrence among 38 of 266 patients [14.3%]
and 271 of 1526 patients [17.8%], respectively).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients who underwent primary laparoscopic
antireflux surgery, 17.7% experienced recurrent gastroesophageal reflux requiring long-term
medication use or secondary antireflux surgery. Risk factors for recurrence were older age,
female sex, and comorbidity. Laparoscopic antireflux surgery was associated with a relatively
high rate of recurrent gastroesophageal reflux disease requiring treatment, diminishing some
of the benefits of the operation.

The aims of our study were to assess the rate of reflux
recurrence after primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery in
an unselected cohort and to identify potential risk factors for
such recurrence.
Methods
Study Design
This was a nationwide population-based retrospective co-
hort study assessing recurrence of reflux in all individuals with
a diagnosis of GERD who underwent primary laparoscopic an-
tireflux surgery in Sweden between January 1, 2005, and
December 31, 2014. The study was approved by the Regional
Ethical Review Board in Stockholm, Sweden. All data are ano-
nymized before delivery, and individual participant in-
formed consent is not required for this type of study accord-
ing to Swedish law.
Data Collection
Data from 3 nationwide complete Swedish registries were
retrieved (ie, the Patient Registry, Causes of Death Registry,
and Prescribed Drug Registry), and the unique personal iden-
tity number assigned to all Swedish residents at birth or
immigration was used to link individuals’data between these
registries. The Patient Registry was initiated in 1964 and con-
tains data in regard to all in-hospital and specialized outpa-
tient health care in Sweden from 2001 onward.13 The registry
includes data about diagnoses and surgical procedures and
was used to identify all individuals with GERD who under-
went laparoscopic antireflux surgery during the study period
in Sweden, and to collect data on comorbidities. Cohort
patients were individually linked to the Prescribed Drug
Registry and Causes of Death Registry to assess medication
use and mortality, respectively. The Prescribed Drug Registry
was initiated in 2005 and contains data on all prescribed and
dispensed medications in Sweden. All prescriptions and dis-
pensed medications in Sweden are filed electronically and
automatically transferred to the Prescribed Drug Registry,
and reporting is mandatory according to Swedish law. Thus,
the recording is nearly 100% complete.14 This registry
includes data about all prescribed drugs with Anatomical
Therapeutic Chemical classification system codes, defined
daily doses, and dates of prescription and dispensation.
These data were used to identify use of proton pump inhibi-
tor and histamine2 receptor antagonist. The Causes of Death
Registry contains constantly updated information on the date
of all deaths in Sweden since 1952. The completeness has
been determined to be 100% for date of death and 99.7% for
cause-specific death, and the agreement between the death
certificate and manually assessed cause of death has been
found to be 96.0%.15,16 The registry was used to censor
patients from follow-up from the date of death and deter-
mine the cause of death.
Exposure
All patients who underwent primary laparoscopic antireflux
surgery for GERD were included in the study cohort (eAppen-
dix 1 in the Supplement). The codes used to define GERD were
78430, 56040, 53911, and 53912 in the International Classifi-
cation of Diseases, Seventh Revision (ICD-7); 78430, 55130,
53093, and 53094 in ICD-8; 787B, 553D, 530B, and 530C in
ICD-9; and R12, K44, K20, K21, and K227 in ICD-10. The codes
representing primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery were
JBC01 and JBW97 in the Nordic Medico-Statistical Commit-
tee Classification of Surgical Procedures. This classification sys-
tem does not differentiate between types of antireflux sur-
gery (eg, total or partial fundoplication). All participants had
to be older than 18 years at the first date of GERD or at pri-
mary laparoscopic antireflux surgery, and the surgery had to
be conducted after January 1, 2005. The Patient Registry was
searched since its initiation in 1964 for antireflux surgery con-
ducted before the study period (ie, January 1, 2005), enabling
exclusion of all patients who had undergone antireflux sur-
gery before the study period.

Sex and age of the patients were retrieved from the registries
used for the present study; age was defined by using the date
Key Points
Question What is the recurrence rate of gastroesophageal reflux
after primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery?
Findings In this retrospective cohort study of 2655 patients who
underwent primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery for
gastroesophageal reflux disease in 2005-2014, reflux recurrence
occurred in 17.7% (83.6% requiring long-term treatment with
proton pump inhibitors or histamine2 receptor antagonists, 16.4%
undergoing secondary antireflux surgery).
Meaning Laparoscopic antireflux surgery was associated with a
relatively high rate of recurrent gastroesophageal reflux disease
requiring long-term medication or secondary antireflux surgery,
diminishing some of the benefits of the operation.

 of birth, which was derived from the personal identity num-
ber available in the registries. Comorbidity was assessed
according to data from the Patient Registry, using the most
updated version of the Charlson comorbidity index, a well-
validated measurement of scoring of chronic comorbidities
based on specific ICD diagnosis codes.17,18 All diagnoses and
surgical procedures recorded in the Patient Registry since its
initiation (1964) were retrieved for all study participants, and
the Charlson comorbidity index score was calculated at the
date of surgery. The calendar year of surgery was determined
by the date of surgery in the Patient Registry. Hospital vol-
ume of antireflux surgery was determined by the unique hos-
pital codes recorded together with the surgery in the Patient
Registry. The registry does not contain data on individual
surgeon volume.
Outcome
The main outcome was recurrence of reflux, which was
defined according to dispensed medication of proton pump
inhibitor or histamine2 receptor antagonist or secondary
antireflux surgery. Dispensed proton pump inhibitor or his-
tamine2 receptor antagonist corresponding to at least 6
months of medication after primary laparoscopic antireflux
surgery or secondary antireflux surgery was defined as a
marker of reflux recurrence. The 6-month cutoff was used to
identify all individuals with recurrence of reflux requiring
long-term medical treatment while excluding patients
receiving such medication for other indications. Six months
of treatment was defined as 6 months of defined daily doses.
The World Health Organization describes defined daily doses
as “the assumed average maintenance dose per day for a
drug used for its main indication in adults,”19 and they are
defined for all Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes
(eAppendix 2 in the Supplement). Use of proton pump
inhibitor and histamine2 receptor antagonist was identified
with the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical codes A02BC
and A02BA, respectively.
Secondary antireflux surgery included both open and
laparoscopic fundoplication (Nordic Medico-Statistical
Committee codes JBC00, JBC01, JBW96, and JBW97) (eAp-
pendix 2 in the Supplement). Follow-up time started at the
date of surgery and ended at onset of recurrence of reflux as
defined by the last dispensing of medication reaching a
cumulative treatment time of 6 months, secondary antire-
flux surgery, death, or December 31, 2014, whichever
occurred first. Furthermore, patients receiving any pre-
scribed proton pump inhibitor or histamine2 receptor
antagonist, regardless of duration, were identified for
descriptive purposes.
Complications
Defined procedure-related acute complications occurring
within 30 days of primary laparoscopic fundoplication or
repeated surgery with laparoscopic or open fundoplication
were assessed from the Patient Registry. These complications
included pneumothorax (ICD-10 code J93), esophageal perfo-
ration (ICD-10 code K223), splenic injury (ICD-10 code S360),
liver injury (ICD-10 code S361), and other specifically surgery-
associated complications (ICD-10 code T81). To determine
the risk of postoperative mortality, data in regard to date of
death, as well as main and contributing causes of death,
were retrieved from the Causes of Death Registry for all
patients who died within 30 days of primary laparoscopic
fundoplication or repeated surgery with fundoplication. In
addition, all patients who had endoscopic dilatation of the
esophagus (Nordic Medico-Statistical Committee code
JCA55) because of stricture or dysphagia (ICD-10 code R13) at
any time after the primary or secondary laparoscopic antire-
flux surgery were identified.
Statistical Analysis
The statistical analyses were predefined and described in a
detailed study protocol completed before the initiation of the
analyses. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to evaluate the
recurrence of reflux over time after primary antireflux sur-
gery. Patients requiring medical antireflux treatment or sec-
ondary antireflux surgery were categorized into 4 predefined
intervals after the primary surgery: less than or equal to 1
year, greater than 1 to 2 years, greater than 2 to 5 years, and
greater than 5 years. Separate analyses of medication and
secondary surgery were also conducted in accordance with
the original study protocol. A separate analysis for young and
healthy individuals was added after the initially planned
analyses were conducted. The risk of reflux recurrence asso-
ciated with the covariates sex (male or female), age at surgery
(categorized as ≤45, 46-60, or ≥61 years), comorbidity
(Charlson comorbidity index score 0 or ≥1), calendar year of
surgery (2005-2006, 2007-2009, or 2010-2014), and cumu-
lative hospital volume (≤24, 25-75, or ≥76 operations per hos-
pital during the entire study period) was analyzed with multi-
variable Cox regression, providing adjusted hazard ratios
with 95% CIs. Thus, the level of statistical significance was
.05. The assumption of proportionality was evaluated and
determined to be well met. A subgroup analysis compared
patients aged 45 years or younger and without comorbidity
(Charlson comorbidity index score of 0), stratified by sex,
with the rest of the cohort. All statistical analyses were
2-sided. The analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statis-
tics version 23.
Results
The study cohort included 2655 patients with GERD who
had undergone primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery
between 2005 and 2014. The sex distribution was even
(51.0% men). The median age at surgery was 51.0 years
(interquartile range, 40.0-61.0 years). The patients were fol-
lowed up for a mean of 5.1 years (SD, 2.8 years) and a
median of 5.6 years (range, 0.0-9.0 years; interquartile
range, 2.6-7.7 years).
Rate of Reflux Recurrence
Among all patients, 470 (17.7%) had recurrence of reflux.
Among these patients, a majority received medication with
proton pump inhibitor or histamine2 receptor antagonist

 only (n = 393; 83.6%), whereas 77 patients (16.4%) under-
went secondary fundoplication. Among the 77 patients,
50.6% had had herniation (n = 39). Characteristics of the
participants with and without reflux recurrence are pre-
sented in Table 1. The reflux recurrence group contained
more patients who were women, were older, and had more
comorbidity compared with patients without recurrence.
More patients underwent laparoscopic antireflux surgery
during the initial study period; the number of surgeries
decreased from 1098 in 2005-2006 to 802 in 2007-2009 to
755 in 2010-2014. A Kaplan-Meier curve was plotted to visu-
alize the cumulative proportion of patients with reflux
recurrence after primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery
(Figure). A total of 30.2% (95% CI, 26.2%-34.5%) of the
patients with reflux recurrence had recurrence during the
first year after surgery, and 48.7% (95% CI, 44.2%-53.2%)
had such recurrence within 2 years of surgery. During the
entire study period, 1826 patients (68.8%) in the cohort
received any amount of prescribed proton pump inhibitor or
histamine2 receptor antagonist.
Risk Factors for Reflux Recurrence
Female sex was associated with an increased risk of reflux
recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.29-1.90), and this
risk was increased in separate analyses of need for medica-
tion and secondary fundoplication (Table 2 and eAppendix
3 in the Supplement). Older age was associated with an
increased risk of reflux recurrence, with an adjusted hazard
ratio of 1.41 (95% CI, 1.10-1.81) among patients aged 61 years
or older compared with those aged 45 years or younger.

 When analyzed separately, the association with age re-
mained for medication, but not for repeated surgery (eAp-
pendix 3 in the Supplement). Patients with comorbidity
(Charlson comorbidity index score ≥1) were at increased risk
of reflux recurrence compared with those without comor-
bidity (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.13-1.65). The association
between increased Charlson comorbidity index scores and
an increased risk of reflux recurrence remained in separate
analysis of only medication as the outcome, but not in the
analysis assessing only secondary fundoplication.
Among 799 participants (559 men and 240 women) aged
45 years or younger and without comorbidity (Charlson
comorbidity index score 0), 62 men (11.1%) and 41 women
(17.1%) had recurrence. The risk of recurrence was decreased
among both men (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.49-0.90) and
women (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.93) compared
with the remaining participants. The risk of recurrence
increased during the study period, from 16.1% in 2005-2006
to 19.5% in 2010-2014 (hazard ratio, 3.86; 95% CI, 2.98-5.02;
P < .001), but this increase was statistically significant only
for medication as outcome (hazard ratio, 5.20; 95% CI, 3.86-
7.01) and not for secondary fundoplication (hazard ratio,
1.20; 95% CI, 0.64-2.24) (eAppendix 3 in the Supplement).
The index surgeries were performed in a total of 52 centers
(volume, 1-718 surgeries). No statistically significant associa-
tions were found between hospital volume of antireflux sur-
gery and the risk of reflux recurrence after primary laparo-
scopic antireflux surgery (comparing ≤24 surgeries and ≥76
surgeries; hazard ratio, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.77-1.53) (Table 2).
Complications After Antireflux Surgery
In all, 109 patients (4.1%) had a defined complication within
30 days of the primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery, and
the most common complications were infection (n = 28;
1.1%), bleeding (n = 24; 0.9%), and esophageal perforation
(n = 24; 0.9%) (Table 3). The 30-day all-cause mortality rate
was 0.1% (n = 2 patients, 1 because of inhalation of a foreign
body and 1 because of suicide). During the entire postopera-
tive follow-up, 21 patients (0.8%) received a diagnosis of
dysphagia at any time, including 14 (0.5%) also requiring
endoscopic dilatation.
In regard to secondary fundoplication, 18 patients
(23.4%) had a complication within 30 days of surgery, and
the most common complications were infection (n = 5;
6.5%), esophageal perforation (n = 5; 6.5%), and bleeding
(n = 4; 5.2%) (Table 3). There were no deaths within 30 days
after secondary fundoplication. Nineteen patients (24.7%)
received a diagnosis of dysphagia, and 8 of these (10.4%)
underwent endoscopic dilatation during follow-up.
Discussion
This study found that 17.7% of patients had recurrence of re-
flux after primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery. Risk fac-
tors for recurrence were female sex, older age, and comorbid-
ity, whereas hospital volume was not a risk factor. Young
individuals without comorbidity had a lower risk of reflux re-
currence compared with the remaining participants.
The current study’
s percentage of patients with recurrent
reflux (17.7%) is lower than that of most cohort studies.
Randomized clinical trials show recurrence rates similar to
that of the present study, ranging between 10% and 15% after
3 to 5 years,6-8 but these trials do not mirror clinical practice
well because they included highly selected patients at spe-
cialized centers. Among cohort studies including 98 to 844
patients, with a follow-up time ranging from 1 to 6 years, the
proportion of patients requiring antireflux treatment after

 primary laparoscopic antireflux surgery ranged from 4% to
43%.9-11,20-22 Highest rates of postoperative antireflux medi-
cation were found in 4 studies with rates between 33% and
43%.9-11,22 In regard to secondary fundoplication, a study of
297 patients found that 17 (5.7%) required secondary fundo-
plication within 2 years of primary surgery,21 a rate similar to
that in a recent study of 9765 patients, in which 540 (5.5%)
underwent secondary antireflux surgery.23
There are several possible reasons for the findings of lower
recurrence rate compared with that in many other cohort stud-
ies. The present study used a population-based design and had
a larger sample size and more complete follow-up than previ-
ous cohort studies. This study also assessed a more recent pe-
riod,inwhichlaparoscopicantirefluxsurgeryhasbecomemore
centralized to expert centers where selection of patients might
be stricter and the quality of surgery might be higher.
In the present study, women had a slightly higher risk
of recurrence of GERD after antireflux surgery than men.
Similar results were observed in a cohort study of 844
patients.9 The higher rate of postoperative medication
among women might be explained by their having more
severe symptoms of GERD despite having endoscopic sever-
ity of GERD similar to that of men.24 Age was another factor
that was associated with an increased risk of reflux recur-
rence after fundoplication. Similar results have been shown
in some earlier studies,9,25 although other investigations
have found contradictory results.26,27 The consequence of
comorbidities on the rate of recurrence of GERD after laparo-
scopic antireflux surgery has, to the best of our knowledge,
not been studied before. It is possible that the increased risk
of reflux recurrence associated with older age and comorbidi-
ties exists because only patients with particularly severe and
refractory GERD in these groups are selected for surgery, and
these patients might also be at a higher risk of recurrence of
reflux. Additionally, it is possible that these groups are more
likely to have large hiatal hernias, which might reduce the
success of antireflux surgery because of difficulties in repair-
ing large hiatal defects. Previous research has found that
larger hospital volumes are associated with more favorable
outcomes, especially in regard to cancer surgery.28,29 How-
ever, no association between hospital volume and the risk of
recurrence of GERD after primary laparoscopic antireflux sur-
gery was observed in the present study.
The complication rates after primary and secondary fun-
doplication were similar to those of previous reports, with a
higher complication rate associated with secondary
surgery.30,31 The low all-cause mortality rate (with no direct
surgery-related deaths) found in the current cohort is also
similar to that of previous research.30,32 The higher risks of
recurrence among older and female patients and patients
with comorbidities suggest that laparoscopic antireflux sur-
gery might be more successful in younger and physically fit
individuals, which is supported by the present analysis of
this subgroup and well aligned with previous research.5
Additionally, previous studies suggest that long-term treat-
ment with proton pump inhibitors might be associated with
adverse events, including an increased risk of hip fractures,
Clostridium difficile–associated diarrhea, and community-
acquired pneumonia.33-36 Most available studies show that
antireflux surgery is more expensive in the short term, but
more cost-effective from a long-term perspective.37
A strength of this study is the population-based design
with virtually complete nationwide coverage of patients with
GERD who have undergone primary laparoscopic antireflux
surgery. This design reflects general clinical practice, mini-
mizes selection bias, and circumvents recall bias. Other
advantages are the high completeness, accuracy, and quality
of the Swedish registry data used for this study. The registries
are based on data submitted from hospitals after patient dis-
charge, which is necessary for reimbursement of health care
costs and contributes to the complete information recorded.
Furthermore, all patients are readily followed up through use
of their personal identity numbers regardless of where they
seek health care, when they die, or whether they emigrate.
Thus, there are no patients lost to follow-up, which is a major
strength of the study.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, there might be varia-
tions in clinical practice in regard to coding, especially
for diagnoses that are not the primary reason the patient
seeks health care. Second, data on unmeasured confounders
(eg, body mass index, tobacco smoking) were not available in
the registries. Although this might have influenced the risk
factor analyses, the main outcome, overall rate of reflux
recurrence after primary laparoscopic fundoplication, was
not affected by any residual confounding. Third, the current
study design did not include a control group (eg, a group of
patients with GERD who did not undergo antireflux surgery).
Such a group would be of value to better compare the rate of
recurrence among individuals who had surgery compared
with those who did not. Fourth, there is uncertainty about
whether the definition of reflux recurrence used was accu-
rate. There was no information about objectively identified
reflux recurrence (ie, from endoscopies or pH measure-
ments). However, studies have shown a poor correlation
between postoperative reflux symptoms and GERD assessed

 with objective measurements, which casts the sensitivity of
such measurements in doubt.38 Fifth, information about
reflux symptoms was not available. However, such symp-
toms have a low specificity when recurrence of reflux is
assessed. The use of treatment of reflux (medical or surgical)
circumvents the low sensitivity and specificity of the alterna-
tive measures presented above and is thus probably the best
currently available option to assess the recurrence of reflux.
Sixth, use of proton pump inhibitors or histamine2 receptor
antagonists bought over the counter might be a concern,
which was not possible to assess in this study and may have
introduced underestimation of reflux recurrence. However,
these medications are sold over the counter only in small
packages and at a high price, whereas dispensed prescrip-
tions are less expensive and eventually free of charge (state-
subsidized) in a progressive discount system, in which the
patient pays maximum 2200 Swedish crowns (approximately
$250) annually for prescribed medications. Thus, patients
who require medical treatment for a longer period would
likely have obtained prescriptions. The 6-month use cutoff
was arbitrary, but a shorter period might have increased the
misclassification of use of proton pump inhibitor or hista-
mine2 receptor antagonist for other indications (eg, ulcer,
occasional dyspepsia), supported by the fact that a majority
of patients (n = 1826; 68.8%) received occasional prescrip-
tions of proton pump inhibitor or histamine2 receptor
antagonist during the study period. The assessment of sec-
ondary antireflux surgery should be complete, but some of
these surgeries were conducted for dysphagia, although this
rate was low (n = 6).
Conclusions
Among patients who underwent laparoscopic antireflux sur-
gery, 17.7% experienced recurrent GERD requiring long-term
medication use or secondary antireflux surgery. Laparo-
scopic antireflux surgery was associated with a relatively high
rate of recurrent GERD requiring long-term treatment, dimin-
ishing some of the benefits of the operation.
