 In defence of genital autonomy
for children
Brian D Earp
ABSTRACT
Arora and Jacobs (2016) assume that liberal societies should tolerate non-therapeutic infant
male circumcision, and argue that it follows from this that they should similarly tolerate—or even
encourage—what the authors regard as ‘de minimis’ forms of female genital mutilation (as
defined by the World Health Organization). In this commentary, I argue that many serious
problems would be likely to follow from a policy of increased tolerance for female genital
mutilation, and that it may therefore be time to consider a less tolerant attitude toward non-
therapeutic infant male circumcision. Ultimately, I suggest that children of whatever sex or
gender should be free from having healthy parts of their most intimate sexual organs either
damaged or removed, before they can understand what is at stake in such an intervention and
agree to it themselves.
INTRODUCTION
In their target article, Arora and Jacobs1
contend, among other things, that if non-
therapeutic
infant
male
circumcision
should be widely tolerated, then so should
some forms of what the WHO calls
‘female genital mutilation’ (or FGM).2 i
Indeed, there are numerous substantial
overlaps,
both
physical
and
symbolic,
between these two types of genital alter-
ation that are not very widely appre-
ciated;3–10 accordingly, I have prepared an
online supplementary appendixii in which
I outline some of the main morally rele-
vant features that they share. For now,
however, let us consider only the condi-
tional
argument
put
forward
by
the
authors, namely that: ‘a liberal society
that tolerates expression of culture and/or
religion in the manner of male circumci-
sion
should
also
permit
certain
de
minimis
[female
genital
altering]
procedures’.1
I offer a different perspective. Rather
than proceeding from the premise that
non-therapeutic,
non-consensual
male
genital
alteration
(MGA)
is
clearly
permissible
(and
should
therefore
be
widely tolerated in liberal societies) to the
conclusion that purportedly ‘de minimis’
forms of non-therapeutic, non-consensual
female genital alteration (FGA) should
also be permitted, I will instead move in
the opposite direction. My strategy will be
to highlight some of the downsides that
seem likely to follow from an increased
tolerance for FGA in W
estern societies,
and use this as a premise from which to
argue that it may be time to consider a
less
tolerant
position
towards
MGA.
Please note that I will not be arguing in
favour of a ‘ban’ on MGA (for reasons I
go into elsewhere)11–13 but rather for its
being
strongly
discouraged,
perhaps
through some form of regulation (akin to
the proposal by Ben-Yami in an earlier
issue of this journal).14
SOME PROBLEMS WITH INCREASING
TOLERANCE FOR FGA IN WESTERN
SOCIETIES
Here are some problems that seem likely
to follow from a more tolerant position
towards FGA.
Legal problems
FGA, including its ‘minor’ forms, is cur-
rently illegal in the vast majority of liberal
societies (I will focus on so-called W
estern
countries,
such
as
the
USA,
Canada,
Australia
and
the
countries
of
Europe).15 16 To change this situation, at
least according to one plausible interpret-
ation, it would require that the laws
regarding physical assault on a minor be
rewritten, potentially creating widespread
disturbances and inconsistencies through-
out their respective legal systems. This is
because, as some scholars have argued,
cutting into a child’s genitals without a
medical
diagnosis,
and
without
its
informed consent, meets the formal defin-
ition of criminal assault under the legal
codes of most of these societies.4
17–20
(Please note that this view assumes that
parental ‘proxy’ consent is invalid for such
procedures, for which arguments have
been given elsewhere.)20–22 Indeed, in its
move to ban FGA in 1997, the US
Congress stated ‘that it ‘infringes upon the
guarantees of rights secured by Federal
and State law, both statutory and constitu-
tional’. That is to say, [non-therapeutic]
female genital cutting [without consent]
was already unlawful’ prior to the enact-
ment of specific legislation.23
A further issue, as Blackstone noted
more than 200 years ago, is that ‘the law
cannot draw [a] line between different
degrees of violence’24 [p. 270]. What this
means is that if any particular act of vio-
lence—such as the cutting of a child’s
body in the absence of medical necessity,
perhaps especially with the effect of dam-
aging or removing functional tissue—is
legally permitted, then fraught decisions
have to be made ‘as to where within the
continuum of violence the limits are to be
fixed’25 [p. 129]. This, in turn, could
open the door for interested parties to
argue, for any proposed act of cutting,
that it is not ‘violent enough’ to warrant
the placement of limitations on parental
decision making.4 More on this will be
said in a subsequent section.
An additional problem is that changing
the law would remove at least one import-
ant tool that reformers from within the
affected communities can appeal to, in
their quest to end the spectrum of FGA
practices. Specifically, many women from
established immigrant groups report that
they do not wish to continue subjecting
their daughters to FGA (for an excellent
review of the evidence concerning ‘cul-
tural change after migration’ with respect
to this issue, see the work of Johnsdotter
and Essén)26 but they may face pressure
from fellow group members.27 This can
make it difficult for any one parent or
family to unilaterally challenge, much less
abandon, the tradition: as Mackie has
argued,
it
is
a
collective
action
problem.28
29 What a legal prohibition
allows, then, is for reformers from within
these groups to be able to point to the law
and say, ‘I have no choice but to keep my
daughter’s
genitals
intact’,
effectively
resolving the social dilemma.27 30
Finally, as Ludbrook argues, ‘the law is
an important symbol and if [it] allows
parents, carers and teachers to [so much
as hit their] children’, much less cut into a
physically and symbolically sensitive part

J Med Ethics: first published as 10.1136/medethics-2015-103030 on 20 January 2016. Downloaded from 
 of their bodies, ‘it is sending a message to
these people and to the community gener-
ally that children are not entitled to the
same right to bodily integrity as adults’25
[p. 129].
Against this view, Arora and Jacobs
argue
that
(what
they
regard
as)
‘de
minimis’ forms of FGA ‘do not constitute
a human rights violation’ with respect to
bodily integrity, because they have ‘no
more effect than other accepted proce-
dures performed on minors for esthetic
enhancement’.1 In previous writings, they
have listed mole removal and cosmetic
orthodontia as examples of such proce-
dures.31 But as I have suggested elsewhere:
‘the genitals (in particular) might plaus-
ibly be seen as having a special, even
unique psychosexual significance com-
pared to other parts of the body, which
could make their un-consented alter-
ation more likely to be experienced
(later on) as a harm. [This] could help to
explain why there is an active ‘genital
autonomy’
movement
in
the
United
States, Europe, and elsewhere—fueled
by women, men, and intersex people
who are extremely resentful about their
childhood genital surgeries—but not an
anti-orthodontics movement or an anti-
mole removal movement’32 [p. 45].
More could be said about this disagree-
ment. For a thoughtful analysis of the
right to bodily integrity as it applies to
preautonomous individuals, see the essay
by Ungar-Sargon in a recent issue of this
journal.33 See also the work of Darby on
a child’s ‘right to an open future’.34 For
an extended articulation of my own views
concerning
the
ethics
of
ostensible
‘enhancement’ procedures in children, see
the references here.5 12 35 36 iii
Regulatory problems
Another problem with the authors’ pro-
posal has to do with monitoring and regu-
lation. As Arora and Jacobs concede, their
suggestion might ‘open the door’ for
‘more invasive procedures [to be carried
out] under the guise of de minimis proce-
dures’,1
thereby
increasing
the
overall
level of harm. In response to a similar
policy proposal by the American Academy
of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2010 (see later dis-
cussion),
the
Somali-born
writer
and
activist Hirsi Ali asked: ‘how could we tell
that parents who want to ensure that their
daughter will be a virgin on her wedding
night will not have her (legally) nicked
[on one day] and then a few months later
(illegally) infibulated?’37 Indeed, as Leye
and colleagues point out, ‘in some com-
munities,
traditional
circumcisers
will
‘redo’ girls if they notice that only an inci-
sion has been made’38 [p. 368].
The authors’ response to this type of
objection is that ‘given the widespread
nature currently’ of the more invasive
procedures, ‘if even a few girls undergo a
de minimis procedure instead of a more
invasive one due to this strategy then the
strategy is appropriate’.1 However, they
do not provide any evidence that the
more
invasive
procedures
are
in
fact
‘widespread’ in W
estern countries, specif-
ically, which is the legal setting most rele-
vant to their arguments (and readership);
in fact the recent survey by Johnsdotter
and Essén stands in direct contrast with
this scenario.26 Moreover, if permitting
‘minor’ forms of FGA actually had the
effect of lending a ‘cloak of respectabil-
ity’ to all FGA procedures—a possibility
that Arora and Jacobs themselves raise,
but do not adequately consider—then
the more invasive forms might very well
increase in number, leading (again) to
greater harm overall. Since the authors
do not provide any persuasive evidence
in
favour
of
their
own
predicted
outcome as opposed to this plausible
alternative, it is unclear why we should
endorse their policy proposal, even on
consequentialist grounds.
A related problem is more practical in
nature. How would the actual cutting ses-
sions be monitored (and by whom) to
make sure that only the ‘right amount’ of
tissue was being incised, damaged, or
removed? Arora and Jacobs admit that
this is a problem with their proposal. But
instead of addressing it, they simply divert
attention to other problematic practices.
As they write: ‘The concern regarding
amount of tissue being removed is … not
unique to FGA, but is similar to male cir-
cumcision as well as cosmetic surgeries on
adults’.1
They are right to raise the example of
male circumcision. At least one underdo-
cumented risk of this procedure, espe-
cially when carried out in infancy, is the
removal of too much tissue—sometimes
causing painful erections when the child
grows up.39–42 To put it simply, there is
no ‘dotted line’ showing where to cut
around an infant’s diminutive penis, just
as there is no determinate location where
the foreskin ends and where the rest of
the
penis
begins.
This
uncertainty
in
terms of where to cut, and the associated
risk of cutting away too much, arguably
speaks in favour of deferring the surgery
until the organ has reached its full size.
Then, the individual whose genital integ-
rity is at stake can indicate exactly how
much tissue - if any -iv he would like to
have removed, and he can do so under
conditions of informed consent.
A similar analysis applies to FGA proce-
dures. In fact, this parallel leads us directly
to the other diversion mentioned by the
authors, namely, ‘cosmetic surgeries on
adults’. The key word is ‘adults’. If an
adult female wishes to undergo a genital
surgery (to choose the most pertinent
example) for cosmetic, cultural, religious
or other reasons, there is indeed, as Arora
and Jacobs point out, a non-trivial risk
that too much tissue will be removed, or
that the surgery will yield unsatisfactory
results in any number of other ways. But
this would be mitigated by the fact that
the surgery was undertaken voluntarily. In
other words, the primary (moral) differ-
ence between consensual genital surgery,
and both FGA and MGA carried out on
children, is that an adult can assess the
relevant risks in light of her own goals
and values, and determine whether they
are ‘worth it’ to her, all things consid-
ered.35 43 A child has no such recourse.
Speaking generally, then, the suggestion
of harm tolerance when it comes to inter-
ventions into children’s bodies is unten-
able. In part, this is due to ‘the difficulty
it presents in terms of specifying an
appropriate threshold for harm that could
be measured in an objective way’4 [p. 98].
As Van Howe notes, the meaning of
‘harm’, in practice, therefore, will inevit-
ably be left up to the interpretational
vagaries of each provider, perhaps in con-
sultation with the child’s parents.44 This
vagueness creates a problem: ‘there are
practitioners, especially in cultures where
female circumcision is common, who fer-
vently believe that more invasive forms of
female circumcision’—that is, forms that
even Arora and Jacobs reject—‘do not
pose risks of physical or psychological
harm’44 [p. 167]. In fact, these providers
could easily make selective appeals to
studies from the medical literature that
appear to show health-based benefits for
FGA,4 as well as an absence of serious
harms,45 much as some supporters of
MGA are prone to do.46

 many purported cultural benefits of FGA
are factored in, Van Howe continues,
‘practitioners could easily convince them-
selves that any harm is more than offset
by
the
many
perceived
benefits’44
[p. 167].
Medical problems
Potential problems concerning clinical and
surgical matters have been raised by Leye
and colleagues. They write: ‘it is difficult
to avoid damaging the clitoris when per-
forming a [‘de minimis’] incision, espe-
cially
in
genitalia
that
are
not
fully
developed’.
Moreover,
‘complications
(such as shock, infections, sepsis, and
bleeding) are difficult to avoid [entirely],
even
with
[such
a
minor]
incision’38
[p. 368]. Thus, as Goldman has stated,
the assumption that ‘de minimis’ interven-
tions into a child’s vulva really are essen-
tially harmless is ‘debatable’. As he goes
on to write: even if it could be shown that
the harm is, in some sense, ‘relatively
minor, it is still harm. Certainly, there is
physical harm or risk of physical harm
any time a cutting instrument contacts
sensitive genital tissue’.48 He concludes,
then, that the ‘burden of proof’ is on
those who argue that the risk of harm is
trivial.
How Arora and Jacobs could meet this
burden is unclear. First, as they note, it is
currently illegal in W
estern societies to
perform FGA procedures in children, so it
is impossible to collect the very data that
would be needed to make their case. But
let us just assume that the ban were lifted.
How long would it be reasonable to allow
for such procedures to be performed in
the
absence
of
high-quality
long-term
follow-up
data
(concerning
such
vital
issues as the effects of these procedures
on, eg, sexual function, sensation and sat-
isfaction) before it became possible to
show that they had, in fact, been more
harmful than Arora and Jacobs guessed
that they would be?
An
example
should
elucidate
the
danger. Consider ‘procedures resembling
elective
labiaplasty
as
performed
in
W
estern nations’, which Arora and Jacobs
use to illustrate category 2 of their pro-
posed typology. This refers to interven-
tions that ‘create morphological changes,
but are not expected to have an adverse
effect on reproduction or on the sexual
satisfaction
of
the
woman
or
her
partner’.1
Arora and Jacobs argue that such proce-
dures should be considered permissible in
young girls, so long as they are requested
by the parents. Problematically, however,
the
only
available
studies
assessing
reproductive and sexual outcomes asso-
ciated with this particular intervention
stem from surgeries performed on con-
senting adult women (or older adoles-
cents);
and
even
then
the
data
are
woefully incomplete.49 But—again—let us
just assume that, one day, researchers do
produce
a
robust
and
convincing
benefit-to-risk
(or
benefit-to-harm)50
profile for non-therapeutic labiaplasty or
similar procedures carried out on adults.
Even so, we could not be sure that the
profile would apply to children.32 For one
thing, sexual outcomes, in particular, are
highly subjective;51 and the women who
undergo procedures akin to labiaplasty
and subsequently report on their effects
are unlikely to be representative of the
general
female
population.
This
is
because, overwhelmingly, they will have
pursued their elective genital surgeries
precisely because they were unsatisfied
with their labia/vulva in some way, and
wanted a change. In the case of a young
girl,
however,
we
cannot
know,
in
advance, how she will (later) regard her
own vulva—she might value her genitals
in their intact state very highly—and so
we are not in a position to judge how
their modification would affect her sexual
experience.
Sexual problems
Against this view, it might be argued that
if genital tissue is excised early enough, a
girl will not ‘know what she is missing’
when she reaches an older age. Similar
arguments are raised in support of per-
forming male circumcision as early as pos-
sible.
But
this
does
not
guarantee
a
‘harmless’ outcome. On the contrary, such
an intervention could just as easily lead to
feelings of loss or resentment—whether
or not the surgery itself was consciously
remembered. After all, a woman might
reasonably wonder what sex, masturba-
tion, and so on would have been like had
her vulva been left intact, and feel angry
that she was not given the chance to find
out. In line with this perspective, there are
indeed
many
documented
reports
of
women (as well as men and intersex
people) who had their genitals modified
for non-therapeutic reasons in early child-
hood, who do in fact experience anger
and resentment. These feelings, in turn,
have the potential to impact negatively on
sexual experience, quite apart from any
‘purely’ physical effects that would ensue
from the loss of sensitive tissue (see
Box 1).22 27 52–56
The lesson here is that classification of
childhood genital surgeries based on ‘pre-
dicted’ effects on sexuality is a mistake.
Since
everyone’s
genitals
are
unique
(including
the
specific
distribution
of
nerve endings, how sensitive the tissue is
in different parts, and so on), and since
Box 1
What are the likely effects of
procedures resembling labiaplasty
on a woman’s sexual experience?
As Runacres and Wood note, ‘the labia
minora are highly innervated along the
entire free edge, and are involved in the
process of engorgement during sexual
arousal. It follows therefore that
labiaplasty has the potential to remove
tissue that contributes to sensory sexual
arousal’. In fact, ‘the labia minora are
second only to the clitoris for both
sensation and sensitivity and are more
sensitive than the vaginal introitus’.49 In
addition, the labia can be orally and
manually manipulated, which may yield
particular sensations that would be
physiologically impossible if the tissue
were removed—an outcome that Arora
and Jacobs seem to regard as irrelevant.
Whether such an outcome is on balance
negative, of course, cannot be
‘scientifically’ determined; rather, it
depends on an individual’s sexual
preferences. For example, for those for
whom the ability to fondle, etc., the
labia is an important part of their sexual
activity, the surgical reduction or
elimination of this tissue would indeed
be expected to ‘have an adverse effect
on … sexual satisfaction’. The upshot is
that everyone is different. Thus, as
Johnsdotter has argued, there is no
consistent relationship between type or
degree of genital cutting—whether in
females, males or intersex people—and
subjective sexual pleasure later on.
Hence: ‘the current academic focus on
the role of genitalia in understanding
sexual pleasure is a dead end. While
genitalia usually are central to sexual
activity, and can be seen as a
prerequisite for sexual intercourse, it is a
misapprehension to see the state of
them (cut or uncut) as determinative of
the individual’s experience of the sexual
encounter. Consequently, ongoing
debates on enhancing or detrimental
effects of circumcision practices often
miss the point, since they are based in
too narrow a theoretical framework of
sexual pleasure’59 [p. 262]. See the
online supplementary appendix for

J Med Ethics: first published as 10.1136/medethics-2015-103030 on 20 January 2016. Downloaded from 
 people have different attitudes towards
intact versus modified genitals, as well as
different sexual preferences that can range
rather widely, it is not ethically useful to
make bland, medicalised statements about
expected sexual satisfaction considered as
an ‘average’ effect of some intervention.
This is especially the case given that such
an
outcome
is
typically
measured
by
reductive
‘scientific’
surveys
involving
numbered scales or similar, often failing
to
control
for
socially
desirable
responding.32 57
Indeed, Arora and Jacobs’s willingness
to
rely
on
such
statements
in
their
endorsement of both male31 and female1
forms of non-therapeutic genital alter-
ation, rather than proceeding cautiously
and recognising the limitations—or even
nonexistence—of the pertinent data,32 is
worrying. When a child’s genitals are on
the line, along with the prospect of dimin-
ishing his or her future sexual function
and/or satisfaction (the latter of which is a
highly subjective notion), we should be
extremely careful about making assump-
tions of no harm when the available data
are so weak and contentious.
Cultural problems
A further problem is that Arora and
Jacobs’s proposal is culturally incoherent.
On the one hand, they decry ‘culturally
insensitive’ laws and language that seek
to eliminate female genital ‘mutilation’.
But on the other hand, they offer a
made-up,
‘medicalised’
ritual
of
their
own design, without explaining how this
would
satisfy
the
real-life
cultural
impulses of the families who endorse
FGA. As they themselves state, ‘W
e are
…
not
suggesting
that
people
whose
beliefs or sense of propriety leads them
to perform these procedures on their
children would necessarily accept altera-
tions to their practices to conform to the
authors’ views of what is acceptable’.1
Indeed—why would they? As Hirsi Ali
has written: ‘To understand this problem,
we need to begin with parental motives.
The ‘nicking’ option is regarded as a
necessary cleansing ritual … the clitoris
is considered to be an impure part of the
girl-child and bleeding it is believed to
make her pure and free of evil spirits’.
Problematically, however, for girls in at
least some communities, the point of
FGA is ‘to ensure their virginity … and
to curb their libido to guarantee sexual
fidelity after marriage’. Thus, when FGA
is intended ‘to ensure chastity before
marriage and to curb female libido …
the nick option [would not be] sufficient’
from a cultural perspective.37
Political problems
Finally, there is almost no chance that
Arora and Jacobs’s suggestion will actually
be taken up by lawmakers: it is a political
non-starter. This can be inferred from the
debacle that ensued in 2010, when the
AAP issued a policy similar to the one pro-
posed by the authors, in the name of ‘cul-
tural sensitivity’. As Arora and Jacobs
discuss, it was summarily retracted ( just
1 month later) after it was met with fierce
opposition
and
even
outrage.58
Opponents of the AAP policy included
survivors of FGA such as Ayaan Hirsi Ali37
and Soraya Mire;58–60 members of its own
ranks;44 61 62 distinguished doctors from
other countries;63 US lawmakers;64 and
organisations such as Equality Now, an
international advocacy network fighting to
end female genital cutting.65 v In fact, I
expect that Arora and Jacobs’s own pro-
posal (as well as perhaps the Journal of
Medical Ethics, for publishing it) will be
met with a similar outcry. While their
article constitutes an interesting (if unori-
ginal)3 academic exercise, W
estern soci-
eties have, for the most part, reached the
seemingly
irreversible
conclusion
that
sharp objects should not be taken to the
vulvas of little girls, unless it is to save
their life or health.11 Importantly, many
immigrant communities in these
same
societies—derived
from
populations
where FGA has traditionally been per-
formed—have reached the same conclu-
sion, and have willingly given up the
practice.26 It would be sobering for those
who have struggled towards this end to
see such progress reversed.
There are numerous other problems
with Arora and Jacobs’s proposal, includ-
ing misleading (or inaccurate) citations
concerning key empirical assertions, but I
do not have the space to cover them all in
detail in this response. Instead, I refer the
reader once again to the online supple-
mentary
appendix
accompanying
this
article, in which I discuss these and other
matters
(see
http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/
medethics-2015-103030).
CONCLUSION
In summary, if W
estern societies were to
change their laws in order to allow for
more ‘minor’ forms of FGA, this would
likely result in: (a) disturbances and incon-
sistencies throughout their legal systems,
possibly
requiring
new
definitions
of
bodily assault and opening the door for
inadvertent legal protection of a wide
range
of
potentially
harmful
practices
(typically carried out on children, who
cannot adequately defend themselves); (b)
removal of an important tool that refor-
mers from within the affected communi-
ties rely on to solve the ‘collective action’
problem introduced by FGA; (c) regula-
tory challenges in tracking and monitor-
ing FGA cutting sessions to ensure that
they were not being used as opportunities
for more invasive procedures; (d) expos-
ure of young girls to an unknown amount
of surgical risk in the absence of medical
need, thereby placing doctors in an unten-
able position with respect to their profes-
sional duties; (e) accusations of cultural
insensitivity,
on
account
of
outsiders
having invented a ‘compromise’ interven-
tion to be carried out in a medicalised
setting, with the aim of replacing the trad-
itional rituals that carry meaning for the
relevant communities; and (f) widespread
outrage
among
women
who
consider
themselves victims and/or survivors of
FGA as well as their allies, and other
forms of political backlash.
In light of these considerations, let us
return to Arora and Jacobs’s major condi-
tional argument, namely, that ‘a liberal
society that tolerates expression of culture
and/or religion in the manner of male cir-
cumcision should also permit certain de
minimis [female genital altering] proce-
dures’.1 I have tried to show that such per-
missiveness
would
result
in
a
fiasco,
making this suggestion (for all intents and
purposes)
a
reductio
ad
absurdum.
Accordingly, there is a growing trend
among scholars of genital cutting, particu-
larly in the fields of bioethics and law, of
arguing that it is time to consider a less
lenient position towards MGA (whether
by banning it with a possible exception for
sincere religious belief, or by regulating it
in other ways), rather than a more lenient
position towards FGA.8 9 17 43 66–68 As
Arora and Jacobs themselves point out,
‘W
e acknowledge that issues of cultural
sensitivity and gender discrimination in
vSimilar patterns have played out in other
countries. For example, as Leye et al38 [p. 367]
report (internal references omitted): ‘In 1992,
two researchers in the Netherlands submitted a
report to the Dutch Ministry of Health in
which they proposed that as a step toward the
total eradication of the practice, incisions of the
clitoris be allowed in cases where the parents or
family wanted to circumcise a girl. This kind of
incision was considered as a nonmutilating
form of ‘female circumcision’, as FGM is
commonly referred to in the Netherlands. This
report’s recommendation provoked a public
debate about the issue that resulted in the total
rejection of any form of FGM and, moreover,
the rejection of any attempts to differentiate
between mutilating and nonmutilating forms of
‘female circumcision’’.

 the disparate treatment of male circumci-
sion and FGA could also be treated by
proscribing both, instead of the position
for which we are advocating. In fact,
many have criticised male circumcision as
a human rights violation due to the lack
of autonomous decision-making and the
irreversible nature of the procedure’.1
Whether
it
is
in
fact
a
fundamental
human
rights
violation,
or
rather
a
morally objectionable practice on other
grounds, ‘it is clear that the current laissez
faire attitude towards MGA that is typical
of W
estern societies—and in particular the
United States—can no longer be main-
tained without facing serious scrutiny.
FGA and MGA are both highly problem-
atic
practices,
with
far
more
overlap
between them (both physically and sym-
bolically) than is commonly understood:
they should not be discussed, therefore, in
hermetically
sealed
moral
discourses’.4
My own perspective is that the most
promising way forward would be to argue
for an ‘autonomy-based’ ethical frame-
work,4 9 whereby ‘Children of whatever
[sex or] gender should not have healthy
parts of their most intimate sexual organs
removed, before such a time as they can
understand what is at stake in such a
surgery and agree to it themselves’.69
