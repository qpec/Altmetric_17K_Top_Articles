Abstract
Background: Literature on population awareness about actual causes of cancer is
growing but comparatively little is known about the prevalence of people’s belief concerning
mythical causes of cancer. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of these beliefs and
their association with socio-demographic characteristics and health behaviours.
Methods: A survey containing validated measures of beliefs about actual and mythical cancer
causes and health behaviours (smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, fruit and vege-
table consumption, overweight) was administered to a representative English population sam-
ple (N Z 1330).
Results: Awareness of actual causes of cancer (52% accurately identified; 95% confidence in-
terval [CI] 51e54) was greater than awareness of mythical cancer causes (36% accurately iden-
tified; 95% CI 34e37; P < 0.01). The most commonly endorsed mythical cancer causes were
exposure to stress (43%; 95% CI 40e45), food additives (42%; 95% CI 39e44) and non-
ionizing electromagnetic frequencies (35%; 95% CI 33e38). In adjusted analysis, greater
awareness of actual and mythical cancer causes was independently associated with younger
age, higher social grade, being white and having post-16 qualifications. Awareness of actual
but not mythical cancer causes was associated with not smoking and eating sufficient fruit
and vegetables.

1. Introduction
Approximately one third to one half of cancer diagnoses
are preventable by changes to lifestyle behaviours,
amounting to at least 1.1 million avoidable cancer cases
per year in Europe [1,2]. As outlined in the latest (4th)
European Code Against Cancer (ECAC), established
cancer risk factors include active and passive smoking
[3], alcohol consumption [4], overweight and obesity [5],
physical inactivity [6], poor diet [7] and exposure to ul-
traviolet radiation [8] and human papillomavirus (HPV)
[9]. Part of the 12 ECAC lifestyle recommendations to
reduce cancer risk, therefore, features advice to not
smoke and have a smoke-free home, to maintain a
healthy body weight, active lifestyle and healthy diet, to
avoid too much sun (especially for children), to limit
alcohol consumption and to take part in HPV vaccina-
tion programmes (for girls) [10]. Yet, in Europe, more
than one third of adults fail to meet aerobic activity
guidelines [11], more than a quarter continue to smoke
[12] and more than half are overweight [13]. In the
United Kingdom (UK), three quarters of the population
do not eat the recommended amount of fruit and veg-
etables [14], and 31% of men and 16% of women drink
alcohol above recommended levels [15]. Accurate public
awareness of cancer risk factors is an important
component of informed decision-making about lifestyle
behaviour change.
Data from multiple European countries indicate poor
awareness of the link between lifestyle factors and can-
cer risk [16e23]. Public understanding of cancer risk
factors is likely to include beliefs in mythical risk factors
with no known association with cancer development.
Baseline findings from a nationwide UK awareness
campaign reported that approximately one third of the
sample endorsed stress as a cause of cancer, and more
than a quarter agreed that living near power lines
increased cancer risk [17]. Similar beliefs have been re-
ported among Dutch bladder cancer survivors, although
the prevalence was markedly lower [24]. Endorsement of
incorrect risk factors is particularly high among under-
served populations, including lower socio-economic
status groups, people with lower levels of education and
ethnic minorities [16,17,20,23,25].
The way in which we think about potential risk fac-
tors for disease can trigger risk reduction behaviours
[26]. For example, causal beliefs about cancer can in-
fluence the use of complementary therapies, diet and
lifestyle and treatment decision-making [27e29]. How-
ever, if behavioural efforts are misdirected towards
reducing risk from mythical cancer causes, behaviour
change for known cancer causes may be less likely to
occur. For instance, melanoma patients report factors
unrelated to sunburn such as stress as a cause of their
cancer [30]. Moreover, the tobacco industry in the past
deliberately funded work on spurious risk factors to
detract from actual causes of neoplastic and cardiovas-
cular diseases, namely smoking [31].
The Cancer Awareness Measure (CAM) is a validated
tool of known cancer risk factors [32], but no measure
has been developed to accurately identify the range of
beliefs people hold about mythical cancer causes. To
address this, we developed the CAMdMYthical Causes
Scale (CAM-MYCS) [33]. The aim of the current anal-
ysis is to use nationally representative data to report the
prevalence of beliefs about mythical cancer causes and
the socio-demographic correlates of holding these be-
liefs. We also examined the associations of CAM and
CAM-MYCS with cancer-related health behaviours.
These data will help to characterise the population and
will inform future cancer prevention research and
practice.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study design
Data come from the Attitudes and Beliefs about Cancer-
UK Survey (ABACUS), a large population-based cross-
sectional omnibus survey in England carried out by
TNS Research International between January 2016 and
March 2016. This survey creates sample points using the
2001 Census small-area statistics and the Postcode
Address File (stratified by social grade and Government
Office Region) for random location sampling. Quotas
for age, gender, children in the home and working status
are set for each location, and three doors are left be-
tween each successful interview. Data were collected
using computer-assisted face-to-face interviews by a
trained interviewer in the respondents’ homes. The study
was approved by the University College London Ethics
Committee (Project ID 5771/002), and participants
consented to participate at the start of the omnibus
survey.

 2.2. Participants
A total of 1990 adults took part in the ABACUS survey
of whom all completed the CAM but only a randomly
selected subsample of 1348 adults was also asked to
complete the CAM-MYCS to determine whether this
new measure influenced responses to the original CAM
[33]. Participants who did not respond to all cancer
belief items were excluded from analysis, resulting in a
final sample size of 1327 adults.
2.3. Measures
2.3.1. Socio-demographics
Participants were asked to provide information about
their age (in years), sex, ethnicity (white/non-white),
marital status (married or living with partner; yes/no),
social grade assessed with the reduced National Statis-
tics Socio-economic Classification measure [34] and
categorised into ABC1/C2DE, education (post-16 [post
high school] qualification; yes/no) and England region
(North/Central/South).
2.3.2. Health behaviours
Smoking status was assessed by asking participants if
they smoked at all these days (including cigarettes hand-
rolled ones, pipes or cigars). Those whose responded
that they smoked daily or occasionally were classified as
smokers. Respondents who did not smoke now but used
to smoke daily or occasionally were classified as ex-
smokers. Those who said they had tried in the past but
had never been a smoker and those who said they had
never smoked at all were classified as never smokers.
Physical activity was assessed by asking participants
on how many days in the past week they had engaged in
a total of 30 min or more of physical activity, which was
enough to raise the breathing rate. Responses were
classified as meeting guidelines if participants had
exercised on 5 or more days [35].
Overweight
was
determined
using
self-reported
weight and height of participants and defined as a
body mass index � 25 kg/m2.
Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed by
asking participants how many portions (80 g serving) of
fruit and vegetables they ate over the past month using
everyday
measures
of
consumption.
Respondents
consuming at least five portions per day on average were
classified as meeting current guidelines [36].
Alcohol consumption was determined by asking re-
spondentsonhowmanydaystheydrankalcohol inatypical
week and how many units of alcohol they drank on a typical
day. Respondents consuming on average 14 units or less per
week were classified as meeting current guidelines [37].
An aggregated behaviour risk score was used, scoring
each health behaviour that did not meet guidelines or
which indicated greater risk as 1, except for smoking
status where current smoking was scored as 2 and past
smoking as 1 [38]. This resulted in an overall health
behaviour risk score ranging from 0 to 6 with higher
scores indicating greater risk.
2.3.3. Cancer beliefs
To assess beliefs about actual and mythical cancer causes,
participants were presented with the closed risk factor
questions of the CAM [32] and the CAMdMYthical
Causes Scale (CAM-MYCS) [33]. These measures have
both been validated using UK populations.
The closed risk factor questions of the CAM ask
about 11 known cancer risk factors (active smoking;
passive smoking; any alcohol consumption; low fruit
and vegetable consumption; any red/processed meat
consumption; being overweight; sunburnt more than
once as a child; being aged 70 years or older; having a
relative with cancer; having an infection with HPV; low
physical activity). The CAM-MYCS measure asks about
12 factors commonly believed to cause cancer for which
there is no scientific evidence (drinking from plastic
bottles; eating food containing artificial sweeteners;
eating genetically modified food; eating food containing
additives; using microwave ovens; using aerosol con-
tainers; using mobile phones; using cleaning products;
living near power lines; feeling stressed; physical trauma;
exposure
to
electromagnetic
frequencies,
i.e.
non-
ionizing radiation of low and high frequencies such as
WiFi and Radio/TV frequencies). For both the CAM
and CAM-MYCS, participants are asked ‘How much
do you agree that each of these can increase a person’s
chance of developing cancer?’ with response options on
a five-point Likert scale (strongly disagree, disagree,
unsure, agree, strongly agree).
For the purposes of this analysis, responses were
coded as follows. CAM and CAM-MYCS items were
dichotomised into ‘correct’ (strongly agree/agree for
CAM; strongly disagree/disagree for CAM-MYCS) and
‘incorrect’ (unsure/disagree/strongly disagree for CAM;
unsure/agree/strongly
agree
for
CAM-MYCS)
re-
sponses. This resulted in a total score of 0e11 and 0e12
for the CAM and CAM-MYCS, respectively. The total
score was converted to a ‘percentage correct’ (0e100)
score, using the percent of maximum possible method to
ensure comparability of both scales. The dichotomised
‘correct’ CAM and CAM-MYCS responses were also
added together, resulting in a 0e23 CAM total score,
converted into ‘percentage correct’ (0e100) score as
before. Because data were approximately normally
distributed, no further conversions were required.
2.4. Analysis
Bivariate associations were assessed with chi-squared
test, t-test, correlations and analysis of variance as
appropriate. General linear models with an identity link
were used to determine independent associations of
socio-demographic and health behaviour variables with

310
 cancer beliefs. For prevalence data, weights were applied
to adjust for sampling bias in relation to age, gender,
government region, social grade and working status
derived from the English 2011 census, Office for Na-
tional Statistics 2013 mid-year estimates and a random
probability survey conducted in 2014 for the National
Readership Survey. Family-wise error rate was cor-
rected using the false discovery rate [39], and multiple
comparisons
were
controlled
for
using
the
Sidak
correction in post hoc analysis. All analyses were carried
out in SPSS 24.0.
3. Results
Sample characteristics are provided in Tables 1 and 2.
On average, participants provided a correct response to
a significantly higher proportion of CAM (53%; 95%
confidence interval [CI] 51e53) than CAM-MYCS
(36%; 95% CI 34e37) items (t[1329] Z 15; P < 0.01).
There was a strong negative correlation between CAM
and CAM-MYCS scores (r Z e0.43, P < 0.01), sug-
gesting that better performance on one measure was
associated with worse performance on the other. The
combined CAM total score indicated that, on average,
fewer than half of items were correctly classified as either
cancer causing or not cancer causing (44%; 95% CI
43e45).
The most commonly endorsed actual cancer causes
(CAM items) were active smoking (88%; 95% CI 86e90)
and passive smoking (80%; 95% CI 78e82). By contrast,
fewer than a third of participants correctly identified
infection with HPV (30%; 95% CI 28e33) or low fruit
and vegetable consumption (30%; 95% CI 27e32) as
causes of cancer (Fig. 1). The most commonly endorsed
mythical cancer causes (CAM-MYCS items) were stress
(43%; 95% CI 40e45), food additives (42%; 95% CI
39e44), exposure to non-ionizing electromagnetic fre-
quencies (35%; 95% CI 33e38) and eating genetically
modified food (34%; 95% CI 31e36). Fewer than a fifth
of participants endorsed using microwave ovens (19%;
95% CI 17e21) or drinking from plastic bottles (15%;
95% CI 13e17) as causing cancer (Fig. 1).
A number of socio-demographic and health behav-
iour characteristics were associated with CAM, CAM-
MYCS and CAM total scores in univariate analyses
(Tables 1 and 2). To disentangle the independent asso-
ciations of these characteristics with cancer beliefs,
multivariate analyses were conducted. Better knowledge
of actual causes of cancer was associated with white
ethnicity, having post-16 qualifications and with greater

4. Discussion
This is the first study to provide population data on
beliefs about a range of actual and mythical causes of
cancer. In contrast with previous work [16], participants
showed relatively poor awareness of factors that are not
causally linked to cancer, with only a third of mythical
cancer causes identified as such. Stress, food additives,
genetically modified foods and exposure to non-ionizing
electromagnetic frequencies were actively endorsed as
causing cancer by more than a third of participants.
Endorsement of mythical causes of cancer appears to
have increased over the last decade. This may be a
reflection of changes in the way people access news
[40] or could result from methodological differences
between our study and previous work (e.g. 16).
Knowledge of risk factors causally linked to cancer
was higher than knowledge of factors not causally
linked to cancer, but still disappointingly low. Low fruit
and vegetable consumption was the least recognised
cancer risk factor, with less than one third of partici-
pants reporting it. Obesity was also poorly recognised,
which is concerning considering it is the second leading
preventable cause of cancer [1]. Similar observations
have been made in a number of European countries,
highlighting an area of concern throughout the region
[17,18,21e23,41]. Raising awareness of the role of
weight in cancer development is likely to be an essential
first step in the behaviour change sequence.
These estimates can be used to benchmark public un-
derstanding of cancer risk factors. Future comparisons
canbe made with these data to monitor improvements and
reductions in cancer awareness. Historically, such com-
parisons have relied on unvalidated survey tools that do
not include mythical risk factors. The CAM-MYCS al-
lows for reliable measurement of beliefs about mythical
cancer causes which will be useful in the evaluation of
future public health programmes. The scale could also be
used to investigate whether cancer survivors attributetheir
disease to known or mythical factors. Such data could be
used to reassure patients, particularly those who experi-
ence stigma or feel a sense of blame regarding their disease

 [42,43]. Indeed, mythical beliefs might be associated with
raised anxiety, especially where the source of the risk is
outside the individual’s control [44,45]. By improving the
accuracy of people’s causal beliefs, we might be able to
reduce cancer fear or worry and make people feel more
empowered about their ability to reduce their risk.
In line with previous research, participants who were
white and had spent longer in education were more likely
to identify actual cancer causes [16,18,25]. Younger age
and white ethnicity were associated with better identifica-
tion of mythical riskfactors.When combining responses to
assess beliefs about both actual and mythical cancer cau-
ses, lower age, white ethnicity, higher social grade and
longer time spent in education were all independently
associated with better awareness of factors that do and do
not cause cancer. These patterns broadly reflect previous
work [16e18], indicating that traditionally underserved
populations are at risk of having a poorer understanding
of cancerriskfactors.Monitoring awarenessofknown and
mythical risk factors is important to ensure socio-eco-
nomic inequalities in cancer knowledge are not widening.
These findings also highlight that information should be
tailored to the needs of those who lack awareness; for
instance, by using graphical, simple ways to communicate
risk to people with limited formal schooling and literacy.
Lower awareness of known risk factors was associ-
ated with a greater likelihood of smoking and not
adhering to the fruit and vegetable consumption guide-
lines. By contrast, better awareness of mythical factors
was associated with a greater likelihood of smoking and
having a higher aggregated behaviour risk score. The
combined measure of awareness of actual and mythical
cancer risk factors indicated that a better understanding
of cancer aetiology was associated with adequate fruit
and vegetable consumption. These complex set of as-
sociations require replicating in additional samples
internationally before definitive recommendations can
be made regarding the link between knowledge of cancer
risk factors and preventive behaviours.
Incorrectly endorsing mythical causes of cancer was
not associated with engaging in riskier health behaviours
in our study. This is reassuring insofar as it would suggest
that simply holding incorrect beliefs about mythical
cancer causes does not necessarily result in poorer lifestyle
choices. However, the fact that a third of participants
believe that factors such as stress, genetically modified
food, food additives and non-ionizing electromagnetic
frequencies cause cancer highlights the need to continue
monitoring risk perceptions [46]. Investigating associa-
tions between the CAM, CAM-MYCS and other cancer
control behaviours, such as cancer screening participa-
tion and early presentation with symptoms, would be a
useful next step for future research.
The finding that those who were better at identifying
actual causes of cancer were also worse at identifying
mythical causes of cancer was unexpected. One possible
explanation may be that some people are generally more
likely to make causal attributions to cancer, whether or
not these are actually true. This may result in more health-
protective behaviours to avoid disease [26], as reflected by
lower smoking rates and greater consumption of fruits
and vegetables among respondents who endorsed both
actual and mythical cancer causes. By the same token, if
people engage in unhealthy behaviours, they may be more
likely to downplay any potential causal associations
(whether or not they are accurate) with cancer. This may
explain why those who correctly rejected mythical causes
of cancer (but also incorrectly rejected actual causes of
cancer) were more likely to be smokers. Suchrisk denial by
smokers has also been observed elsewhere [47].
This study has limitations. These data were cross
sectional and therefore we cannot make causal claims
about the associations between cancer beliefs and socio-
demographic or behavioural correlates. Further research
would benefit from longitudinal and experimental work to
determine the direction of this association and whether or
not improving awareness of actual or mythical causes of
cancer, or both, influences health behaviour choices.
Moreover, both measures of beliefs about actual and
mythical causes of cancer used in our study may require
validation in other countries across Europe to ensure
universality of the identified factors. This is particularly
important, given the observed associations with ethnicity.
Relatedly, we did not measure religiosity or fatalism as
explanatory correlates which are likely to influence peo-
ple’s views on what does or does not cause cancer. In
addition, the items included were risk factors attributed to
cancer generally, rather than being site specific. As was
performed with the CAM, site-specific versions of the
CAM-MYCS can be developed in the future. Finally, the
measures of health behaviours used in this study were self-
reported and may, therefore, be biased assessments of
adherence to health behaviour guidelines.
5. Conclusions
Knowledge of actual causes of cancer is greater in the
general population than that of mythical causes. However,
awareness was generally low for both types of factor,
which likely has implications for efforts to promote cancer
prevention in the general population. The pattern of as-
sociations
between
socio-demographic
groups
and
awareness of actual and mythical risk factors was
inconsistent but should continue to be monitored to ensure
inequalities in cancer knowledge are not widening.
Engagement in health-protective behaviours is associated
with accurate beliefs about actual cancer causes but shows
no association with endorsement of mythical causes.
