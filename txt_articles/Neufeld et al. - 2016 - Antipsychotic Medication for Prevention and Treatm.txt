 Intervention—Antipsychotic administration for delirium prevention or treatment in randomized 
controlled trials or cohort studies.
Measurements—Two authors independently reviewed all citations, extracted relevant data and 
assessed studies for potential bias. Heterogeneity was considered as chi-square p<0.1 or and I2 
>50%. Using a random effects model (I2 > 50%) or a fixed effects model (I2 < 50%) we calculated 
odds ratios (OR) for dichotomous outcomes (delirium incidence and mortality), and mean/
standardized mean difference for continuous outcomes (delirium duration, severity, hospital/ICU 
length of stay (LOS)). Sensitivity analyses included 1) postoperative prevention studies only, 2) 
exclusion of studies with high risk-of-bias, and 3) typical versus atypical antipsychotics.
Results—Screening of 10,877 eligible records identified 19 studies. In seven studies comparing 
antipsychotics to placebo or no treatment for delirium prevention in postoperative patients, there 
was no significant effect on delirium incidence (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.23, 1.34; I2 = 93%). Using 
data reported from all 19 studies, antipsychotic use was not associated with change in delirium 
duration, severity, hospital or ICU LOS, with high heterogeneity among studies. No association 
with mortality was detected (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.62, 1.29; I2 = 0%).
Conclusion—Antipsychotics for prevention or treatment of delirium is not supported by current 
evidence. Additional methodologically rigorous studies using standardized outcome measures are 
needed.

Introduction
Delirium, a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by acute change in arousal and 
cognition, arising from an underlying medical insult, is associated with poor clinical 
outcomes, including personal suffering, cognitive decline, institutionalization after 
hospitalization, increased costs, and increased risk of death.1–4
A major impetus for developing this guideline for postoperative delirium was the result of a 
survey given to participants in the American Geriatrics Society Geriatrics-for-Specialists 
Initiative (AGS GSI). Participants identified delirium as an essential area in the care of older 
adults that was the least understood.5 Having identified lack of knowledge of delirium as the 
area of greatest need, the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) initiated the postoperative 
delirium clinical practice guideline project. A panel of experts was formed and a systematic 
review of the literature was conducted to develop these guidelines.6, 7 One major focus for 
the panel was evaluating whether current evidence supported use of antipsychotic 
medications in the perioperative period to prevent or treat delirium in older adults.
Although the focus was on older post-operative patients, the panel raised concerns that the 
existing literature was too limited; hence, the search included antipsychotic use to prevent or 
treat delirium in all hospitalized adults. Therefore, the objectives of this paper were to report 
a systematic review and meta-analysis addressing two questions: (1) Does “preventive” 
antipsychotic administration reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium in adult

 patients? and (2) Does antipsychotic treatment in hospitalized adult medical or surgical 
patients with delirium improve outcomes, including: duration and severity of delirium, 
hospital and ICU length of stay (LOS), institutionalization at hospital discharge, and 
mortality?
METHODS
Eligibility Criteria
This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Institute of Medicine 
guidelines (Reference) and reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines.8 The specific 
approach has been described in detail previously.6, 7 (http://geriatricscareonline.org/toc/
american-geriatrics-society-clinical-practice-guideline-for-postoperative-delirium-in-older-
adults/CL018). This systematic review included published and unpublished randomized 
controlled trials (RCTs), and prospective or historical cohort, case-control, and other 
observational studies. Inclusion criteria included a focus on prevention or treatment of 
delirium in an adult medical or surgical inpatient settings, including ICU or general inpatient 
units. Exclusion criteria included non-English publications, narrative review articles, 
editorials, commentaries, letters, dissertations, and studies that focused exclusively on 
pediatric, alcohol/substance withdrawal, schizophrenia, dementia, stroke, neurosurgery or 
trauma patient populations, or nursing home, and other non-hospital settings (e.g., 
rehabilitation, hospice, outpatient and emergency department). Articles were also excluded if 
delirium identification was not conducted using a validated tool.
Search Strategy and Study Selection
We performed a comprehensive review of the literature, supplemented by additional targeted 
and focused searches. PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL electronic databases were searched 
for the period from January 1, 1988 to November 26, 2013, using the following search 
terms: “delirium”, “organic brain syndrome”, and “acute confusion” in combination with a 
variety of alternative terms for the prevention and treatment of delirium including all 
variations of the words “prevention”, “management”, “treatment”, “intervention”, “therapy”, 
“therapeutic”, or “drug therapy.” Two targeted searches using the U. S. National Library of 
Medicine PubMed Special Queries on Comparative Effectiveness Research and PubMed 
Clinical Queries were completed using the terms “delirium”, “postoperative delirium”, 
“acute confusion”, and “organic brain syndrome”. Trials containing the terms “quetiapine”, 
“haloperidol”, “olanzapine”, and “risperidone”, “delirium” or “confusion” were retrieved 
from the registry of clinical trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, restricting the search to completed 
studies with available results. Review of reference lists from published narrative review 
articles and systematic reviews were used to identify additional studies.
Data Extraction and Assessment of Risk of Bias
Two guideline project leaders (SKI and TNR) independently reviewed each title and abstract 
to determine eligibility for study inclusion. The full article was reviewed if any uncertainty 
was present regarding eligibility. A separate group of 4 trained reviewers created evidence 
tables using a standardized form. The following data were collected from each eligible 
study: author, year, study design, patient population, sample size, intervention and control, 
Neufeld et al.

 delirium measure, outcomes, and adverse events. Each eligible article was evaluated using 
Cochrane risk of bias assessment,9 by at least 2 independent reviewers. Discrepancies were 
arbitrated by one of the authors (SKI), who also independently reviewed a random 10% 
subsample of all articles to verify accuracy of the abstractions and risk of bias assessment 
ratings. Moreover, authors (KJN, JY, DMN) reviewed the individual risk of bias ratings to 
select the final articles considered to be at low risk of bias.
Data Analysis
Meta-analyses were performed when two or more studies using similar interventions were 
identified. Dichotomous outcomes (e.g. the incidence of delirium or mortality) were 
presented as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Continuous 
outcomes (e.g. duration and severity of delirium, length of hospital and ICU stay) were 
analyzed using mean difference (MD), or standardized mean difference (SMD) when 
different scales were used across studies (e.g., delirium severity). Delirium severity was 
evaluated using the Delirium Rating Scale (DRS)9 or the DRS-98R.10 When specific data 
could not be obtained directly from the publications (n=4), authors were contacted with all 
providing additional statistics.20,21,25,28
Heterogeneity was assessed using the chi-square and I2 statistics, with p <0.1 and I2 >50% 
considered substantial heterogeneity. With high heterogeneity, a random effects model was 
used for meta-analysis; otherwise a fixed-effect model was used.
We undertook the following relevant sensitivity analyses: (1) restricting to only 
postoperative prevention studies, (2) including studies with a low risk of bias, and 3) 
comparing typical versus atypical antipsychotics. A funnel plot was created to test for 
publication or other reporting biases for analyses that included more than 10 studies (e.g., 
mortality).11
RESULTS
Description of Studies
A total of 10,877 citations were screened for eligibility with 19 meeting criteria. (Figure 1) 
The studies were divided into postoperative delirium prevention (n=7),12–18 and included 
those trials where treatment was started in the perioperative period to prevent incident 
delirium, and studies that evaluated delirium treatment (n=12) in mixed samples of 
hospitalized adult patients (i.e., medical and surgical admissions receiving treatment for 
prevalent delirium)19–30 (Table 1) The 7 postoperative delirium prevention studies focused 
on surgical patients with average age ranging from age 6116 to 87 years17, and 6 were 
randomized controlled trials (RCT) of an antipsychotic agent versus placebo, evaluating 
risperidone in two trials,12, 16 olanzapine in one trial,15 and haloperidol in four.13, 14, 17, 18 
Administration of antipsychotics included pre- and postoperative administration in 2 of the 7 
studies13, 15 with one dose given the day prior to surgery, followed by doses on postoperative 
day (POD) 115 or POD 1, 2 and 313; the remainder administered postoperative doses only 
with the duration ranging from POD 112, 16–18 to POD 5.14 Dosages ranged from 1.0 to 7.5

 mg equivalents of haloperidol per day31 with either oral or intravenous routes of 
administration.
There were 12 treatment studies that included mixed surgical and non-surgical populations, 
with average ages ranging from 3919 to 8427 years across studies. Five studies focused on an 
ICU population.20, 21, 25, 26, 28 RCT design was used in 10 of 12 studies, comparing 
antipsychotics (including both haloperidol and atypical antipsychotics) to placebo or no 
treatment (n=5)20, 21, 25, 27, 28 or comparisons between antipsychotic agents 
(n=7).19, 22–24, 26, 29, 30
Risk of Bias
Three postoperative prevention studies,12, 13, 16 two treatment studies in ICU patient 
populations with both medical and surgical patients21, 25 and one treatment study in a non-
ICU hospital setting with medical admissions24 were included as low risk of bias (Appendix 
Table 1). A funnel plot for the mortality outcome did not suggest systematic bias in reporting 
(Appendix Figure).
Meta-Analysis Results
The effect of antipsychotic medication on incident delirium was derived from the seven 
postoperative prevention studies outlined in Table 1. The remaining meta-analyses were 
derived from all of the 19 studies in Table 1 reporting comparable data on the outcomes of 
interest. Outcomes by study are tabulated in the Appendix Table 2. The major findings are 
summarized below.
Delirium Prevention in the Postoperative Period
There was no significant association of antipsychotic administration with the incidence of 
delirium in the seven studies evaluating 1,970 patients (OR 0.56; 95% CI 0.23, 1.34; I2 = 
93%).12–18 (Figure 2) A sensitivity analysis of three studies at low risk of bias (n=657 
patients)12, 13, 16 did not change this finding (OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.19, 1.08; I2 = 71%).
Delirium Duration and Severity
Use of antipsychotics was not associated with a difference in duration of delirium among 
581 patients in seven postoperative prevention and treatment studies reporting this outcome 
(MD −0.65 days; 95% CI −1.59, 0.29; I2 = 80%).12, 13, 15, 20–22, 25 (Figure 2) These findings 
were unchanged with sensitivity analyses including only postoperative prevention studies 
(n=279 patients, 3 studies)12, 13, 15 and including studies at low risk of bias (n=411 patients, 
4 studies)12, 13, 21, 25 (MD = −0.71 days; 95% CI: −2.14, 0.71; I2 = 91%; and MD = −0.78 
days; 95% CI: −2.23, 0.68; I2 = 77%, respectively).
Severity of delirium was not associated with administration of antipsychotics in 464 patients 
in 8 studies (SMD −0.11; 95% CI −0.43, 0.22; I2 = 61%).13, 15, 19, 22, 24, 27, 29, 30 (Figure 2) 
These findings were unchanged with sensitivity analyses including only postoperative 
prevention studies (n=178 patients, 2 studies)13, 15 and including studies at low risk of bias 
(n=120 patients, 2 studies)13, 24 (SMD = −0.18; 95% CI: −1.80, 1.43; I2 = 96%; and SMD = 
−0.42; 95% CI: −1.59, 0.74; I2 = 90% respectively).

 Hospital and ICU Length of Stay
Antipsychotics administered for the postoperative prevention or treatment of delirium was 
not associated with hospital LOS in 1,454 patients in eight studies (MD = −0.01 days; 
95%CI: −0.16, 0.14; I2= 42%).12, 13, 16, 18, 20, 21, 25, 28 (Figure 3) This finding was 
unchanged with sensitivity analyses based on only postoperative prevention studies (n=752 
patients, 4 studies)12, 13, 16, 18 or including studies at low risk of bias (n=485 patients, 5 
studies)12, 13, 16, 21, 25 (MD = 0 days; 95% CI: −0.15, 0.15 days; I2 = 0% and MD = −0.05 
days; 95%CI: −0.74, 0.65 days; I2 = 0% respectively).
There was no significant association with ICU LOS in 1,400 patients from seven studies 
(MD = −0.46 days; 95% CI: −1.15, 0.24; I2 = 91%).12, 16, 18, 20, 21, 25, 28 (Figure 3) 
Sensitivity analysis of only postoperative prevention studies (n=684 patients, 3 
studies)12, 16, 18 or studies at low risk of bias (n=431 patients, 4 studies)12, 16, 21, 25 resulted 
in the same finding (MD = −0.36 days; 95% CI: −1.10, 0.39; I2 = 97%; and MD = −0.55 
days; 95% CI: −1.39, 0.29; I2 = 52% respectively).
Institutionalization and Other Adverse Events
Three studies15, 17, 20 reported outcomes related to institutionalization after hospitalization at 
different points in time (immediately following hospitalization vs. at 3 months follow-up). A 
wide variety of adverse effects were monitored and reported (Appendix Table 2). 
Heterogeneity of outcomes prevented meta-analysis. However, there was no apparent pattern 
of higher reported adverse events in intervention versus control groups.
Mortality
Among all studies, there was no significant association of antipsychotics with mortality 
measured up to 30 days following hospital stay in 1,439 patients in 10 studies reporting this 
outcome (OR 0.90; 95% CI 0.62, 1.29; I2 = 0%).12, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 27, 28 (Figure 4) 
This finding remained consistent in the following sensitivity analyses: including only 
postoperative prevention studies (n= 567 patients in 3 studies),12, 17, 18, or including studies 
at low risk of bias (n = 395 patients in 4 studies)12, 21, 24, 25 (OR = 1.65; 95% CI 0.69, 3.93; 
I2 = 44%; and OR = 0.98; 95% CI 0.54, 1.76; I2 = 0% respectively).
DISCUSSION
This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that antipsychotic pharmacotherapy does 
not improve outcomes when used for prevention or treatment of delirium in hospitalized 
adult patients. Antipsychotics were not associated with improvements short-term mortality, 
severity or duration of delirium, and length of ICU and hospital stay. However, existing 
studies demonstrate heterogeneity in study design, including diverse populations, with few 
studies focused specifically on older postoperative patients. There was substantial variability 
in outcome measures with few postoperative studies evaluating mortality and functional 
outcomes.
A number of other systematic reviews have examined the effect of antipsychotics on 
postoperative delirium with different conclusions.32–38 One publication concluded that

 antipsychotics do prevent delirium: however this analysis included unpublished RCT data of 
haloperidol versus placebo in patients undergoing hip fracture repair surgery. Results for this 
study required imputation due to a lost randomization code.38 The only systematic review to 
include all of the same studies identified in this review did not perform a meta-analysis.32 
An additional 5 meta-analyses included up to 6 of the same studies analyzed in this report, 
and concluded that there was a modest postoperative delirium protective effect of 
antipsychotics.34–38 The inclusion of an additional study focused on older adults undergoing 
surgery and the only study to include participants of significantly older average age (84 
years)19 contributed to the non-significant association in the meta-analysis of delirium 
prevention. This finding, based upon all postoperative studies of varying design and quality, 
was congruent with the sensitivity analysis excluding studies with high risk of bias, a 
comparison not provided in other published meta-analyses.
Our results were consistent with the findings of a meta-analysis33 that included three RCTS 
of haloperidol vs. placebo.13, 14, 18 No association between antipsychotics and the 
prevention of post-operative delirium was demonstrated. Other outcomes examined in this 
review, including delirium severity and duration, length of ICU and hospital stay, and 
mortality were consistent with other analyses that did not demonstrate a significant effect of 
antipsychotics on these outcomes.32, 36, 37
To-date, this systematic review and meta-analysis is the most comprehensive in coverage of 
published data. We included all available studies of hospitalized patients. Merging 
postoperative prevention studies with treatment studies of patients with delirium during 
surgical or medical admissions is warranted due to the limited available data in homogenous 
populations. While this approach may increase the power for evaluating uncommon 
outcomes, it may also have limitations related to heterogeneity of the included studies. For 
example, data from critically ill septic patients may not be generalizable to infection-free 
older adults undergoing surgery. Combining trials that used very different methodologies 
and drugs for preventing delirium may have resulted in an erroneous conclusion that there is 
no difference in incidence of postoperative delirium when using antipsychotics as a 
preventive intervention. For example one high quality perioperative study12 concluded that 
there was a significant difference in the incidence of postoperative delirium, if patients 
exhibiting any symptoms of delirium in the immediate postoperative recovery period on the 
day of cardiac surgery were treated every 12 hours with an oral dose of risperidone 0.5 mg. 
This design, which selects a subset of patients at highest risk for the development of 
delirium on subsequent hospital days, may not be comparable to other designs that treat all 
patients regardless of risk.39, 40 Not-with-standing this criticism, we believe that our findings 
are important to report, given that they are consistent with the sensitivity analyses after 
comparing more homogeneous studies, restricted to the preventive postoperative designs and 
excluding those at high risk of bias.
Heterogeneity of outcome measures points to the great need for standardization.41–43 Of the 
seven postoperative studies included in this review, only 3 collected mortality data and 2 
reported on rehabilitation status following hospitalization for surgery at two differing time 
points. Consensus regarding collection of core outcome measures42 in clinical trials for

 delirium would make comparison of studies and meta-analysis more feasible to help advance 
knowledge in this field.
Careful reflection on which outcomes are most meaningful to clinicians and patients should 
also inform future research. While antipsychotics in this review do not appear to decrease 
the incidence of delirium in the postoperative period, or improve other outcomes when used 
to treat delirious adult inpatients, none of the studies evaluated symptomatic relief 
attributable to these medications. Decreasing patient agitation and distress is a common 
reason for the prescription of antipsychotics in hospitalized adults and yet the field has no 
uniform data on those outcomes. Much more work in this area is needed to delineate the best 
strategies around delirium prevention, particularly in high-risk populations such as older 
postoperative patients. Well-powered randomized controlled evaluations, particularly among 
older at-risk patients immediately post-anesthesia, with well-defined outcomes are warranted 
in order to better understand whether there is any benefit from these medications.
CONCLUSIONS
There is insufficient evidence currently to support the routine use of antipsychotic 
pharmacotherapy to prevent or treat delirium in hospitalized adult patients, including in the 
postoperative setting. There is a great need to standardize outcome measures via creation of 
a core outcome set for delirium prevention and treatment trials and conduct of additional 
rigorous well-powered RCTs in high risk populations.
