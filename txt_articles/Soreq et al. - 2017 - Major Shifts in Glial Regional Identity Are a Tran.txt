In Brief
Human brain aging is determined by a
complex interplay of regional and cell-
type-specific molecular events. Soreq

regional expression patterns, while
microglia-specific genes globally
increase their expression upon aging.
Moreover, immunohistochemistry reveals
decreased numbers of oligodendrocytes
and neuronal subpopulations in the aging
neocortex.

SUMMARY
Gene expression studies suggest that aging of the
human brain is determined by a complex interplay
of molecular events, although both its region- and
cell-type-specific consequences remain poorly un-
derstood. Here, we extensively characterized ag-
ing-altered gene expression changes across ten
human brain regions from 480 individuals ranging
in age from 16 to 106 years. We show that
astrocyte- and oligodendrocyte-specific genes, but
not
neuron-specific
genes,
shift
their
regional
expression patterns upon aging, particularly in the
hippocampus and substantia nigra, while the ex-
pression
of
microglia-
and
endothelial-specific
genes increase in all brain regions. In line with
these changes, high-resolution immunohistochem-
istry demonstrated decreased numbers of oligoden-
drocytes and of neuronal subpopulations in the aging
brain cortex. Finally, glial-specific genes predict age
with greater precision than neuron-specific genes,
thus highlighting the need for greater mechanistic
understanding of neuron-glia interactions in aging
and late-life diseases.
INTRODUCTION
Aging, an inevitable time-dependent functional decline, is pre-
sent in all living organisms. The intimate relationship between
aging and neurodegeneration raises the possibility of shared
transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation pro-
grams; however, we still lack a comprehensive transcriptome-
wide picture of the effects of aging across different human brain
regions and cell types (De Strooper and Karran, 2016). RNA
expression profiling of the aging brain has been studied histori-
cally using a limited number of brain regions in animal models
or human post-mortem tissues. A major unrealized goal there-
fore remains a comprehensive characterization of the transcrip-
tional landscape across multiple human brain regions in a
physiological age range, which may provide insights into the
cellular architecture and molecular pathways of aging.
The unparalleled complexity of the human brain is a function of
its structural and functional cellular diversity, which arises from
tightly regulated transcriptional programs. Limited availability
to human post-mortem samples has hampered comprehensive
transcriptomic analysis of the brain, particularly of region- and
cell-type-specific
diversity.
However,
through
international
collaboration, a comprehensive atlas of the brain’s transcrip-
tome based on samples from two individuals (the Allen Brain
Atlas) has been achieved. This study illustrated how transcripts
of genes involved in different pathways are expressed across
the brain, but the potential effect of age on the regional differ-
ences was not examined.
By current consensus, astrocyte (AC) and neuronal numbers
appear generally preserved in aging (Fabricius et al., 2013; Mat-
arin et al., 2015; Pelvig et al., 2008). It is clear, however, that
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and other neurodegenerative diseases
for which age is a major risk factor are associated with inflamma-
tory changes mediated by microglia (MG) (Cribbs et al., 2012;
Frank et al., 2008). Brain aging includes accumulation of senes-
cent MG, altered signaling, and pro-inflammatory phenotypes
(Mosher and Wyss-Coray, 2014), and it was shown that MG
display regional sensitivity to aging (Streit and Xue, 2010). Im-
mune-related changes were also strongly associated with aging
in mouse models of amyloid pathology (Matarin et al., 2015).
Nevertheless, animal models and human tissue have reported

 variable and apparently contrasting alterations in ACs (reactivity
or atrophy) and MG (MHC class II antigen increase or atrophy)
(Cerbai et al., 2012; Streit and Xue, 2010; Tremblay et al.,
2012). Accumulation of oligodendrocytes (OLGs) was previously
reported in aging monkey cortex (Peters and Sethares, 2004),
while stereological quantification of glia in neocortical regions
of old brains has suggested a reduction in the number of
OLGs, as evident by a >3-fold greater atrophy of the sub-cortical
white matter (WHMT) compared to cortical regions and an age-
determined loss of myelin (Head et al., 2004; Vernooij et al.,
2008).
Furthermore,
MG-mediated
neuroinflammation
has
been described as a common hallmark of both AD and Parkin-
son’s disease (PD) and is believed to be mechanistically impor-
tant in driving pathogenesis (Orre et al., 2013; Perry and Teeling,
2013). Collectively, these findings suggest that the field stands to
benefit from systematic and comprehensive analysis of aging-
related changes in the cellular and molecular composition of
the human brain.
Apart from the study of region-dependent microglial response
to aging, the importance of both region- and cell-type-specific
changes in the aging brain remains poorly understood. Studies
have been hampered by the limited availability of cross-regional
post-mortem tissue across a range of ages. To overcome these
limitations, we analyzed gene expression patterns in ten brain re-
gions (including cortical and sub-cortical areas) using more than
1,800 brain samples from two large independent cohorts, repre-
senting the most comprehensive human aging brain gene
expression analysis to date. We report striking changes in cell-
type-specific expression patterns across different brain regions,
which revealed major shifts in glial regional identity upon aging in
the human brain.
RESULTS
In this study, we examined two extensive gene expression data-
sets from post-mortem human samples and sampled multiple
(up to ten) brain regions per individual. The primary dataset
was produced by the UK Brain Expression Consortium (UKBEC)
and included 1,231 tissue samples collected from 134 adult indi-
viduals between 16 and 102 years old, with each contributing
post-mortem samples of up to ten brain regions (Figure 1Ai).
The brain regions included both cortical and sub-cortical re-
gions, specifically the frontal cortex (FCTX), temporal cortex
(TCTX), occipital cortex (OCTX), intralobular white matter
(WHMT), cerebellum (CRBL), substantia nigra (SNIG), putamen
(PUTM), thalamus (THAL), hippocampus (HIPP), and medulla
(MEDU). The second dataset, which allowed independent
external cross-validation, was produced by the North American
Brain Expression Consortium (NABEC) (Gibbs et al., 2010; Ku-
mar et al., 2013), including 307 samples from two brain regions
(age range: 16 to 101 years old; Figure 1Aii). The third dataset
was also used for validation including samples with an age range
of 27 to 106 years old (Lu et al., 2014). None of the brain samples
had neuropathological evidence of diagnosable degenerative

age groups each (young: 16–44, middle: 45–74, old: R75). (i) The main
analyzed dataset (UKBEC) is composed of 1,231 brain samples interrogated
by exon microarrays, from brain samples of 134 individuals from 16 to
102 years old and up to ten brain regions each. The brain regions included both
cortical and sub-cortical regions, specifically: the frontal cortex (FCTX), tem-
poral cortex (TCTX), occipital cortex (OCTX), intralobular white matter (WHMT),
cerebellum (CRBL), substantia nigra (SNIG), putamen (PUTM), thalamus
(THAL), hippocampus (HIPP), and medulla (MEDU) for UKBEC and the FCTX
and CRBL for NABEC. (ii) The independent (NABEC) dataset of brain samples

quantification of the neuronal cell population (an example of one of the NeuN
stained sections is shown on the right, in the zoomed-in view of the area
marked on the left-hand side). OLG, oligodendrocyte.

 diseases (Table S1). To detect differentially expressed genes, we
assigned each sample to one of three age groups (young: 16–44,
middle: 45–74, old: R75 years old) and applied a collection of
tailored data-mining computational approaches (Figure 1). We
excluded gender-based sample separation to specifically iden-
tify the effects of age on gene expression profiles.
Region-Specific and Global Transcriptional
‘‘Signatures’’ of the Aging Human Brain
We first sought to address whether region-specific differences in
gene expression patterns occur within the brain upon aging.
Both the number of differentially expressed genes (threshold:
false discovery rate [FDR] < 1e�3) (Figure S1) and the direction
of expression change varied in a region-specific manner (Fig-
ure 2A). The general directions of gene expression change
were preserved in the independent NABEC dataset (Figure 2B).
We applied a stringent threshold to enable isolation of global
changes across the UKBEC brain regions. Most changes were
specific for one region (hereafter referred to as ‘‘region specific’’)
or a few regions (hereafter referred to as ‘‘region selective,’’
including genes altered in two to seven regions), while some
genes were altered in eight or more brain regions (hereafter
referred to as ‘‘multi-regional’’), and nine genes were found to
be significantly altered in all ten brain regions upon aging
(FDR < 1e�3, hereafter referred to as ‘‘cross-regional’’) (Fig-
ure 2C; Figure S2). The rates and number of overlapping age-
altered genes varied between pairs of brain regions (Figure S2).
Multi-regional genes predominantly exhibited increased expres-
sion levels upon aging (Figures 2Dviii–2Dix). This group of genes
was enriched in the Gene Ontology (GO) term ‘‘immune
response’’, which had the general trend to be upregulated in ag-
ing (Figure 2E).
Nine Cross-Regional Aging-Altered Genes Accurately
Predict the Age Categories
To assess the ability of different groups of genes to classify the
brain samples in both cohorts by brain region and age group
criteria, we next used a non-linear dimension reduction classifi-
cation method. The expression of regional-selective genes
separated the samples well based on their regional identity (Fig-
ure S2). In addition, genes with aging-altered expression pat-
terns in the CRBL, WHMT, or cortical samples generally have
distinctive regional expression, as evident by sample-to-sample
correlation scores that were computed among each of the 1,231

 brain samples based on their expression signals (Figures 3Ai and
Aii; Figure S1B). The 642 CRBL-altered genes showed high inter-
regional correlation in expression patterns with the cortical re-
gions (including the HIPP), the 265 cortical aging-altered genes
revealed high correlation among the cortical regions and HIPP
samples, and the 801 WHMT-altered genes showed increased
correlation specifically within CRBL and WHMT.
In contrast to region-specific aging-altered genes, expression
patterns of these cross-regional genes were correlated among
samples only based on age, rather than brain region (Figure 3Aiii).
Eight of the pan-regional genes were upregulated, and one
(HIST1H4C) was downregulated upon aging (Figure 3B; Table
S5). The cross-regional genes successfully discriminated the
samples based on age group in most UKBEC cases (130 of
134) (Figure 3B). One of these genes was a non-coding RNA
(DLGAP1-AS1) that is antisense to the protein-coding gene
(DLGAP1). We identified a robust, reciprocal relationship in
expression between DLGAP1 and DLGAP1-AS1 upon aging.
DLGAP1 is highly brain-specific, while DLGAP1-AS1 and
DLGAP1-AS2 are normally expressed in internal organs and
the bone marrow (Gene Cards database) (Harel et al., 2009).
We find that in contrast to upregulation of DLGAP1-AS, expres-
sion of DLGAP1 shows an aging-altered decrease across brain
regions, despite not reaching statistical significance in each
region (Figure 3B). This demonstrates coupling between the
age-dependent decrease in the expression of the brain-specific
protein-coding gene DLGAP1 and the increase of its antisense
RNA, which is otherwise only expressed outside of the brain.
As a sign of the validity of the cross-regional genes, they
were efficient in classifying samples of the independent NABEC
dataset based on age, even though the NABEC data were
not used to identify these genes (Figure 3C). Moreover, a
non-linear classification based on these genes separated sam-
ples belonging to young, middle-age, and old groups in the
UKBEC, the NABEC, and an additional independent FCTX brain
expression cohort (Lu et al., 2014) (Figure 3D; Figure S3C). This
model also verified the prediction of age group based on
expression levels in the NABEC cohort (Figure S3A). To exclude
the effects of other variables, we show that the UKBEC sam-
ples were not classified by gender (Figure S3B). The cross-
regional genes also correctly classified samples by age group
in an additional independent dataset of cortical samples (Lu
et al., 2014; Figure S3) and did not classify the UKBEC dataset
by gender (Figure S3).
Major Shifts in Region-Specific Expression Profiles of
Glia-Specific Genes in the Aging Brain
To investigate the biological relevance of the age-related gene
expression changes, we first examined the expression profiles
of
the
cross-regional
genes
in
recently
produced
RNA
sequencing (RNA-seq) data from seven purified mouse brain
cell types (Zhang et al., 2014). All cross-regional genes were ex-
pressed in a cell-type-specific manner, in particular within glial
cells and mainly in MG and OLGs (Figure S4A). We therefore
further examined the cell-type-specific expression patterns of
all aging-altered genes. For this, we calculated genome-wide
expression scores to identify genes specific for each cell type
(Table S3). We then examined whether expression of cell-type-
specific genes was altered upon aging. For three cell types (neu-
rons, ACs, and OLGs), enrichment data previously generated by
microarrays was also available (Cahoy et al., 2008). We selected
genes that were demonstrated to be specific by both our defined
cell-specific lists found by analysis of RNA-seq data (Zhang
et al., 2014) and the published microarray cell-specific lists
from mice (Cahoy et al., 2008), in addition to being altered in ag-
ing. In agreement with the great diversity of neuronal cell types
across different brain regions, neuron-specific genes were
most enriched among the regional aging-altered genes (Fig-
ure S4B). In contrast, glia-specific genes were most enriched
among the multi- and cross-regional altered genes, and this
was most pronounced for OLG precursors and MG (Figure S4B).
We first sought to investigate the changes in expression of
MG-specific genes, because these cells have been most exten-
sively linked to aging so far (Erraji-Benchekroun et al., 2005;
Sibille, 2013). Consistent with previous studies (Erraji-Benchek-
roun et al., 2005; Sibille, 2013), most MG-specific aging-altered
genes had low expression in brain samples from the young group
but strongly increased their expression in all regions in the old
group samples (Figure S5A). Our study extends these findings
to a multi-regional phenomenon. Moreover, we find that a small
number of MG-specific genes have high absolute expression in
the young group but decreased expression upon aging in all re-
gions. This suggests that the change in expression not only re-
flects an increased number of MG but most likely also includes
a dramatic change in the MG gene expression program.
Although most brain regions were not strongly separated by
the MG-specific aging-altered genes, the CRBL was distinct
(Figure 4A). This complies with a report of a distinct MG expres-
sion profile in the CRBL of young mice (Grabert et al., 2016).

 Apart from the CRBL samples that formed a separate cluster,
samples from the old group clustered together for all other re-
gions and separately from younger samples, indicating that
MG-specific gene expression is more defined by age than by
regional identity (Figure 4A). The aging-altered endothelial-spe-
cific genes showed a similar pattern of changes as the MG-spe-
cific genes, with a general upregulation across all brain regions
and a notable age group separation and lack of clear regional
identity (Figure S5D).
Next, we examined the expression profiles of genes specific
for either ACs or OLGs. In young samples, we observed much
higher absolute expression of AC-specific genes in the midbrain
regions compared to cortex and HIPP (Figure S5). However, AC-
specific genes increase their expression within cortical regions
and exhibit decreased expression in basal ganglia (BG) upon ag-
ing (Figure 4B); therefore, their absolute expression signals
become more similar across regions in the aging brain (Fig-
ure S5A). SNIG and THAL, which show the highest expression
of AC-specific genes in the young brain, have a generic decrease
of AC-specific genes upon aging (Figure 4B). In contrast, the AC-
specific genes with the lowest expression in the young group in-
crease their expression upon aging in all regions except SNIG
and THAL. This leads to remarkable shifts in the regional patterns
of AC-specific gene expression. Although expression of AC-spe-
cific genes clustered most brain regions separately for the young
group, only four regional clusters remained in the old group, two
of which were the CRBL and the cortical regions (Figure 4B). The
most pronounced change is seen for HIPP and SNIG. For
example, HIPP clusters close to cortex in the young group but
shifts toward the WHMT and PUTM in the samples from the
old group (Figure 4B).
The aging-altered genes that are specific for all stages of OLG
differentiation, including OLG precursors, newly formed OLGs,
and myelinating OLG generally show a trend toward decreased
expression in all regions upon aging (Figures S5A–S5C). More-
over, OLG-specific genes show a shift of region-specific gene
expression upon aging, with the strongest change of regional
identity seen in HIPP and SNIG. In the samples from the young
group, HIPP clusters close to cortical samples and SNIG clus-
ters close to MEDU and THAL, whereas in the samples from
the old group, HIPP and SNIG cluster closer to each other
(Figure 4C).
Similar to the OLG-specific genes, the aging-altered neuron-
specific genes showed predominant downregulation in all brain
regions upon aging (Figure D; Figure S5B), in agreement with
previous
studies
that
observed
decreased
expression
of
neuron-specific genes in the cortex (Erraji-Benchekroun et al.,
2005), but with the added insight that this occurs in a brain-
wide manner. Classification based on aging-altered neuron-spe-
cific genes yielded a striking separation of samples based on
their regional identity (Figure 4D), and the old group samples re-
mained clustered closest to the young samples of the same brain
region (Figure 4D). Thus, neuron-specific gene expression is
more defined by regional identity than by age. This agrees with
the finding that the downregulated genes, which are often
neuron specific, are also generally region-specific, while the up-
regulated genes, which are often MG specific, are generally
multi-regional (Figure 2D; Figure S5B).
Specific Neuronal Subpopulations and
Oligodendrocytes Are Decreased in the Aging Brain
To examine how gene expression changes may relate to
changes in brain cell populations, we developed an efficient
pipeline for analysis of high-resolution image tiles of immunola-
beled sections of FCTX. We developed a targeted computational
pipeline for detection and quantification of the stained cells
based on the scanned images, which consists of big data detec-
tion, segmentation, and quantification pipeline using threshold-
ing, filtering, and object detection.
Noting the trend for decreased expression of OLG-specific
genes in the frontal cortex (Figure 4D), we examined serial sec-
tions immunolabeled with OLIG2 antibody from the tissue blocks
from the same brain samples that were used for the microarray
study. We selected three young and three old cases based on
their microarray profiles, such that it was representative for their
age (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). Approxi-
mately 50,000 image tiles were analyzed from the three young
and three old FCTX sections (Figure 5A). We counted the number
of OLIG2-positive cells compared to the total number of cell
nuclei in each tile. Statistics was calculated on two classes of
tile density, likely corresponding to local variations in the propor-
tion of white matter (low density of nuclei) and gray matter (high
density of nuclei), in addition to all densities combined (all tiles).
The number of OLIG2-positive cells decreased in all classes of
tiles in the aging FCTX, with the largest decrease in the low-den-
sity tiles in old compared to young cases (Figure 5C, middle
panel). In contrast, the number of other cells significantly
increased low-density tiles (Figure 5C, lower panel), in agree-
ment with the slight increase in the total number of cells in the
same tiles (Figure 5C, upper panel). This analysis demonstrates
that the decreased expression of OLG-specific genes might
partly reflect a decrease in three cortical OLG cell population.
The aging RNA expression signatures also revealed downre-
gulation of neuron-specific genes (Figure 4B); therefore, we
analyzed high-resolution images produced from the three young
and three old FCTX sections stained with NeuN antibody to mark
the neurons. This antibody detects the neuron-specific RNA-
binding protein RBFOX3, which is predominantly nuclear, but
is also present in the cytoplasm of the cell body (Kim et al.,
2009) (Figure 6A). We used the tissue samples from the same
cases as were used for OLIG2 quantification, thus allowing direct
comparison of the two cell types. To capture the large diversity of
both shape and size of cell bodies in the neuronal populations,
we used a large tile size (10,000 3 10,000 pixels each) (Fig-
ure 6Bi). This allowed us to extract information from almost all
layers of the neocortex in each slide of gray matter. A preliminary
quality control analysis flagged one image from a young
individual as a technical outlier, and this sample was therefore
omitted from further analysis, although we provide access to

Six FCTX brain sections were stained and imaged (from three old and three young post-mortem brain samples). Each sample contains thousands of equal-size
slides each 1,600 3 1,200 pixels, as captured by a Zeiss AxioScan slide scanner following staining with the Olig2 antibody.

cell counts randomly sampled from the entire population of the six samples, using 100 random iterations over 500 permutations where the true-label t statistics is

group slides (left). From a total of 2,612 young and 1,828 old group high-density slides, the 50 slides with the highest density were selected per case for
quantification. Similarly, from 1,154 young and 1,277 old group low-density slides, the 50 slides with the lowest density were chosen per sample for quantification.

 age-dependent decrease in each neuronal population was
tested with right-tailed two-sample t test. We observed no
change in the number of neurons with small or medium-size
cell bodies, which represent 80% of detected neurons. In
contrast, the number of neurons with large or very large cell
bodies is significantly decreased (p = 0.029 and p = 0.007,
accordingly; right-tailed two-sample t test) Figure 6C).
Altogether, it is likely that changes in gene expression
observed in our study reflect a combination of changes in
expression profiles and changes in quantity of specific cell types.

 While most neuron-specific genes are predominantly downregu-
lated, the extent of this downregulation varies among brain re-
gions. All other cell types have a more complex pattern of
changes. These changes appear most pronounced in HIPP
and SNIG, which show the strongest shifts in the regional
expression pattern of AC- and OLG-specific genes upon aging.
MG- and Endothelial-Specific Genes Are the Best
Predictors of Biological Age
Given our aforementioned findings, we next sought to gain
insight into whether glial genes can predict age category with
more fidelity than neurons and sought to understand the precise
nature of gene expression changes driving this. Having estab-
lished cross-regional and cell-type-specific gene expression
relationships upon aging, we next asked which cell-type expres-
sion patterns within the brain are most associated with age. We
applied a stepwise regression to construct an age-associative
model based on the expression signals of cell-type-specific
genes to compare them (Figure 7; Figure S4; Supplemental
Experimental Procedures). We accounted for both the brain
bank source and the cause of death. Application of the model
uncovered defined groups of the highest age-relevant genes
for each cell type. In a few cases, interaction between two genes
was found to be age predictive (Table S3). Several multi-regional
genes were also detected as age-predictive cell-type-specific
genes, including CP, SGPP1, and VWF, which were detected
as OLG or endothelial specific (Table S4). MG-, AC-, and endo-
thelial-specific genes were most highly associated with biolog-
ical age, while the smallest number of age-predictive genes
was found among the neuron-specific genes (Figure 6). Alto-
gether, our data implicate expression of glial-specific genes,
rather than neuronal-specific genes, as the most reliable predic-
tor of biological age in the human brain.
Functional Enrichment Analysis of Multi-regional and
Region-Specific Aging-Altered Genes
To gain further insight into the functional nature of aging-altered
genes, we performed enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology
(GO) terms of these genes (Edgar et al., 2013). The upregulated
multi-regional genes were enriched in the following functional
terms: ‘‘MG cell development’’, ‘‘interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor
activity’’, and ‘‘immune response’’. Supporting these observa-
tions, neuroinflammation is known to be involved in aging, with
evidence implicating the interferon type I response in aging-
associated cognitive decline (Baruch et al., 2014). Conversely,
downregulated multi-regional genes were enriched in the pro-
cesses of ‘‘protein transport and localization’’, and aging-altered
expression of these genes led to shifts in regional identity (Fig-
ure S2B). Moreover, 244 of a total of 253 genes annotated to
the ‘‘protein transport’’ category were detected as altered
upon aging in at least one brain region. These genes separated
the CRBL from the other regions and maintained their regional
sub-classification (Figure S5Bi). In addition, the CRBL samples
of the old group remained clearly separated from the rest

 (Figure S5Bii). Most aging-altered genes annotated to this cate-
gory were downregulated in eight regions, apart from the CRBL
and WHMT, which showed greater expression variability (Fig-
ure S5Biii). The WHMT aging-altered genes were functionally
enriched in ‘‘regulation of cell adhesion’’, ‘‘regulation of cell
development’’, ‘‘metabolic processes’’, and ‘‘cognition’’ (Fig-
ure S6A). Conversely, among the top functional terms that
were enriched in aging-altered genes in the FCTX were immune
functions including ‘‘T cell differentiation’’, ‘‘T cells’’, and ‘‘leuko-
cyte and lymphocyte activation’’ (Table S2). Among the CRBL-
enriched functions were ‘‘cell adhesion’’, ‘‘regulation of cell
motion and migration’’, and ‘‘neuron projection morphogen-
esis’’. These results imply a region-specific functional heteroge-
neity of the brain aging process.
Analysis of the cell-type-specific aging-altered genes revealed
enrichment of further functional pathways. ‘‘Synaptosome’’,
‘‘regulation of programmed cell death’’, and ‘‘metal ion trans-
porter’’ were enriched in downregulated neuron-specific genes.
‘‘Regulation of adaptive immune response’’, ‘‘natural killer cell-
mediated cytotoxicity’’, and ‘‘cell adhesion and motion’’ were
enriched in MG-specific upregulated genes (Table S2). ‘‘Myeli-
nation’’, ‘‘oxidoreductase’’, and ‘‘RAS protein signal transduc-
tion’’
were
enriched
in
upregulated
OLG-specific
genes.
‘‘Mitochondrial matrix’’, ‘‘phosphate metabolic process’’, and
‘‘Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
AD’’ were enriched in downregulated myelinating OLG-specific
genes. Finally, ‘‘cell morphogenesis’’ and ‘‘cell-cell adhesion’’
were enriched in upregulated AC-specific genes. Some of these
functions have also been identified in a study that examined the
initial cell-type-specific transcriptional changes in a mouse
model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), including synaptic
functions in neurons and membrane signaling defects in OLGs
(Sun et al., 2015).
DISCUSSION
This study presents a comprehensive analysis of RNA expres-
sion in ten regions of the human brain and large-scale cell
quantification in FCTX upon aging. Our findings show that cell-
type-specific genes delineate samples based on both age group
and brain region. Aging was the major determinant of glia-spe-
cific gene expression shifts in regional identity, while such
changes were not evident in neuron-specific genes. Genes spe-
cific for neurons and OLGs generally decreased their expression
upon aging, while MG-specific genes increased their expression
profiles, consistent with the known MG activation in aging (Nor-
den and Godbout, 2013). ACs showed a more complex pattern
of reciprocal regional changes upon aging, with upregulation in
the cortical regions and downregulation in the deeper brain
structures. Among the genes specific for the non-neuronal cell
types, those with the highest absolute expression in the young
group decrease their expression upon aging in most brain re-
gions, while those with the lowest expression in the young group
increase their expression in a subset of regions. This leads to
major shifts in region-specific gene expression, particularly of
AC- and OLG-specific genes, which are most pronounced in
the HIPP and SNIG, the regions that are archetypally affected
in the most common age-related neurodegenerative diseases
(AD and PD, respectively). These findings reinforce a growing
body of evidence implicating glia in aging (Norden and Godbout,
2013).
Age-related
degeneration
of
OLG
has
been
previously
observed in the HIPP of the senescence-accelerated mice, as
well as other animal models (Hayakawa et al., 2007; Hwang
et al., 2006; Shimeda et al., 2005). OLG-specific genes were
also found to have the strongest enrichment among genes with
decreased age-related expression in human TCTX (Tollervey
et al., 2011). We demonstrate that the age-related downregula-
tion of OLG-specific gene expression is accompanied by a
decrease in OLG cell numbers in the FCTX, consistent with pre-
vious observations of decreased OLGs in neocortical regions of
old human brains (Fabricius et al., 2013; Pelvig et al., 2008). The
OLG-specific aging-altered genes include MBP, a major constit-
uent of the myelin sheath, and LINGO1, a regulator of myelina-
tion (Mi et al., 2005). It is of interest that the low-density tiles
(corresponding to likely white matter) show the largest decrease
in oligodendrocytes and a corresponding increase in other cells
(Figure 5). Given the strongest upregulation of MG-specific
genes in the brain, it appears possible that the increase of other
cells is driven by the increase in MG, but this remains to be
directly examined.
We found increased AC-specific gene expression in human
aging HIPP, which agrees with data from aging mouse models,
in which increased proliferation and activation of ACs are re-
ported (Hayakawa et al., 2007) (Figure 4). An examination of
three sub-regions of mouse HIPP using three AC-specific protein
markers revealed complex, region-specific, and marker-depen-
dent changes (Rodrı
´guez et al., 2014). Regionally encoded AC
expression is important for neuronal functions, as was demon-
strated by the loss of ventral spinal cord AC-encoded SEMA3A
gene expression, which leads to selective death of a-motor neu-
rons in mice (Molofsky et al., 2014). We find many regional differ-
ences in expression of AC-specific genes are largely erased in
samples from the old group; for example, these genes cluster
the HIPP and PUTM separately in the young group, but not in
the old group (Figure 4B). This suggests that major changes in
functional heterogeneity of AC take place in the aging brain,
which might have deleterious consequences on the integrity of
neuronal circuits.
A trend toward increased expression of MG-specific genes
was observed in all regions upon aging, with corresponding
upregulation of genes with immune or inflammatory functions.
The upregulated genes include C1Q, which agrees with the
increased C1Q protein levels that were observed in both mouse
and human brains upon aging (Stephan et al., 2013). Another up-
regulated gene is TREM2, which is also upregulated in amyloid-
plaque-associated MG (Frank et al., 2008) and contains variant
alleles that increase AD risk (Guerreiro et al., 2013). Upregulation
of inflammatory functions is in line with evidence implicating the
interferon type I response in age-associated cognitive decline
(Baruch et al., 2014).
In addition to glial changes, we also observed a decreased
number of neurons with large cell bodies, which represent
approximately 20% of neurons in the cortex. Although we did
not attempt to directly identify the neuronal subtypes in the pre-
sent study, neurons with the largest cell bodies are likely to be
Cell Reports 18, 557–570, January 10, 2017
567
 associative pyramidal neurons (Zeba et al., 2008). Furthermore,
these neurons were previously indicated to be most vulnerable
to aging in a study of Rhesus monkeys (Gilman et al., 2016).
While our analysis indicates that the decrease in these pyramidal
neurons may be the primary source of the downregulation of
neuron-specific genes, our findings regarding the cortical
neuronal cells remain speculative due to the limited number of in-
dividuals used for the imaging analyses. Moreover, it remains
possible that the change does not result from loss of these neu-
rons, but rather from downregulation of Rbfox3 protein, or its
loss from the cytoplasm of large neurons. Thus, our current anal-
ysis will need to be verified with the use of additional markers of
specific neuronal cell types and increased sample size, which
will potentially include additional brain regions; ideally, it will
also be compared to the outcomes of cell-type-specific analyses
of RNA sequencing datasets (Lake et al., 2016).
Age is the major risk factor for both AD and PD, the two most
prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. It is becoming clear that
the pre-clinical stage of AD begins decades before clinical mani-
festation (Dubois et al., 2014). This pre-clinical stage has been
termed ‘‘the cellular phase,’’ because it involves changes in
interactions among all cell types in the brain, with the most dra-
matic changes taking place in AC, MG, and vasculature (De
Strooper and Karran, 2016). We find a corrosion of glial region-
specific gene expression in aging, with the genes specific for
AC, MG, and endothelial cells being the best predictors of age.
HIPP and SNIG are affected in the early stages of AD and PD,
respectively, and these are the two regions with major shifts in
their regional expression profiles of AC- and OLG-specific genes
upon aging. Thus, our data may provide insights into the role of
glia in the region-specific vulnerability in these age-related
neurodegenerative diseases.
By simultaneously assessing changes in cell-type-specific
genes across multiple brain areas, our study takes a step toward
providing a comprehensive framework of the molecular and
cellular changes in human aging. While our primary aim was to
deconvolute the cell-type-specific signatures present within
large databases of age-related transcriptional changes, we
also made a step toward interpreting these in light of changes
in counts of OLG and neuronal cells. Integration of further
genome-wide and single-cell data from human tissues samples
and cell and animal models will be required to fully understand
the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the observa-
tions in our study. Altogether, our study indicates that the cellular
changes during aging involve a dramatic shift in the regional
identity of glia, and it provides a resource for further studies
of the relationship between aging and the cellular phase of
dementia.
Conclusions
Our study examines brain-wide gene expression patterns in the
aging human brain across a wide physiological age range,
coupled with complementary analysis of cell-type-specific
marker genes and validation by direct cell quantification using
immunohistochemical imaging followed by targeted computa-
tional analysis. In addition to the expected increase in expression
of MG-specific genes and decrease in expression of neuron-
specific genes, our analyses uncovered major changes in the re-
gion-specific expression of AC- and OLG-specific genes. The
age-associated changes in the regional expression of glial-spe-
cific genes are most dramatic in HIPP and SNIG, the brain re-
gions affected in AD and PD. The age-dependent decrease in
expression of OLG- and neuron-specific genes aligns with the
results of direct cortical cell counting, in which decreased
numbers of OLGs and of neurons with large cell bodies are
demonstrated. We believe that our data and computational ap-
proaches provide a powerful resource for further study of the
cellular and molecular changes taking place during human brain
aging and provide insights into the pre-clinical cellular phase of
dementia.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Ethical Statement
All samples used for this study had fully informed consent for retrieval and were
authorized for ethically approved scientific investigation (Research Ethics
Committee number 10/H0716/3).
Brain Samples
Post-mortem human brain material was produced under institutional guide-
lines governed by approved protocols. Tissue samples were produced from
99 individuals by the Sudden Death MRC brain bank, 35 individuals by the
Sun Head Institute for the UKBEC, and 305 individuals by the American Brain
Bank (NABEC).
Quality Assessment and Array Pre-processing
For the UKBEC dataset, all quality measurements were extensively described
in a previous publication (Trabzuni et al., 2011). The initial pre-processing of the
microarray data, including application of RMA (robust multi-assay) average
quantile normalization with guanine cytosine (GC) background corrections
(GC-RMA) and expression data were log2 transformed. The gene level signal
estimates were calculated for a total of 26,493 transcripts using the median
signal of each group of probe sets interrogating a transcript.
Expression Data Analysis
A tailored analysis pipeline was developed for all computational analyses and
data visualization of microarray and RNA-seq datasets that were analyzed in
this study (in MATLAB, R2014-2016a). Those include construction of data
structures and statistical significance inference using ANOVA, with false
discovery rate (FDR) thresholding (of corrected p < 1e�3), classification and
clustering (e.g., using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding [t-SNE]
and hierarchical clustering), and data visualization.
Cell-type-specific genes were defined by analysis of RNA-seq data from
mouse brain (http://web.stanford.edu/group/barres_lab/brain_rnaseq.html)
and were further used to find age-predictive cell-specific genes. The lists are
under Tables S5 and S6, accordingly. Additional cell-specific lists were based
on a previous microarray data on three of these cell types (Cahoy et al., 2008).
Further details are in the Supplemental Information.
High-Resolution Imaging and Analysis of Immunolabeled Brain
Samples
Post-mortem human brain sections were placed into xylene and rehydrated.
Antigen retrieval was performed with citric acid. For OLG staining, the samples
were immunolabeled with OLIG2 antibody using the Leica Novolink Polymer
detection kit. We used the Olig2 antibody from Millipore (catalog #AB9610)
at 1/200 dilution. For staining of neurons, the samples were immunolabeled
with NeuN antibody (Acris) and the Leica Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution#1
was used (AR9961 from Leica Biosystems) (AR9961 from Leica Biosystems).
The images for both types of stains were acquired on the Zeiss AxioScan slide
scanner. Details of the cell detection and quantification computational
methods for neurons are given under the Supplemental Experimental Proced-
ures. In addition, all raw jpeg images of the slides can be seen at https://
figshare.com/s/f2675361af1242f3565f. For image analysis, we employed
