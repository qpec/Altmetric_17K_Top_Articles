Abstract
Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a life-threatening disorder, commonly caused by defects in 
polycystin-1 (PC1) or polycystin-2 (PC2), in which tubular epithelia form fluid-filled cysts 1, 2. A 
major barrier to understanding PKD is the absence of human cellular models that accurately and 
efficiently recapitulate cystogenesis 3, 4. Previously, we have generated a genetic model of PKD

 using human pluripotent stem cells and derived kidney organoids 5, 6. Here we show that 
systematic substitution of physical components can dramatically increase or decrease cyst 
formation, unveiling a critical role for microenvironment in PKD. Removal of adherent cues 
increases cystogenesis 10-fold, producing cysts phenotypically resembling PKD that expand 
massively to 1-centimeter diameters. Removal of stroma enables outgrowth of PKD cell lines, 
which exhibit defects in PC1 expression and collagen compaction. Cyclic AMP, when added, 
induces cysts in both PKD organoids and controls. These biomaterials establish a highly efficient 
model of PKD cystogenesis that directly implicates the microenvironment at the earliest stages of 
the disease.
PKD affects one in ∼ 1000 people worldwide, with no known cure 1, 2. Animal models do 
not fully genocopy or phenocopy human PKD, and are too complex physiologically for a 
minimal reconstitution approach7, 8, 9, 10. A human cellular model is needed to complement 
animal models and reveal the early pathophysiology of PKD. We have generated human 
pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with targeted, biallelic mutations that lack the mature form of 
PC1, or any detectable PC2, using the Cas9/CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats) gene editing system (Supplementary Fig. 1a-b) 6, 11. Under adherent 
culture conditions, kidney organoids derived from PKD1-/- or PKD2-/- hPSCs form fluid-
filled cysts, although cystogenesis is highly inefficient (∼ 7 % of organoids), and its 
mechanism has not been determined6. We used this system as a starting point to investigate 
how cysts form and identify modulators of cystogenesis. Time-lapse imaging revealed that 
cyst formation involved two steps: first, rearrangement of a tubule within an organoid, 
resulting in deformation of linear shape to form a ‘pre-cyst’ surrounding an hollow pocket; 
and second, partial detachment of the pre-cyst from the underlying stratum followed 
immediately by rapid expansion, resulting in a buoyant cyst tethered to an adherent organoid 
remnant (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Fig. 1c-d, and Movie 1). Cysts therefore arose from whole 
tubular segments that expanded and partially detached from the adherent surface.
Based on these results, we hypothesized that adherent forces played a critical role in limiting 
tubular deformation and subsequent cyst formation. To test this, organoids were purified on 
day 21 of differentiation, prior to the formation of cysts, and transferred to wells coated with 
an anti-adhesive hydrogel to generate suspension cultures (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1e, 
and Movie 2). After two weeks in suspension, ∼75 % of PKD organoids formed large, free-
floatingcysts (Fig. 1c-d), a 10-fold increase in cyst formation over adherent cultures6. 
Control organoids of identical genetic background formed cysts only very rarely under these 
conditions, indicating that cystogenesis remained a specific consequence of the PKD 
mutations (Fig. 1c-d). As an inherent property of this differentiation system in both PKD and 
control cultures, each of the organoids placed into suspension was relatively small (∼ 250 
μm in diameter) and contained only ∼ 5 tubules, therefore a significant proportion (∼ 15 %) 
of individual tubules deformed into cysts. In long-term cultures, PKD cysts further expanded 
massively and reached diameters of ∼ 1 centimeter, reflecting a 4000-fold increase in size 
over the original organoid (Fig. 1e). Even after many months in suspension, cysts remained 
rare among control organoids, which formed smaller, denser aggregates (Fig. 1d-e). Thus, 
modification of the material environment enabled the establishment of a highly efficient 
minimal reconstitution system for PKD cystogenesis.

 Histological analysis revealed that PKD organoid cysts were lined with a thin, squamous 
epithelial layer, approximately one single cell in thickness, with irregular edges, surrounding 
a hollow lumen (Fig. 2a). When compared to cysts from various stages and subtypes of 
clinical PKD in vivo, organoid cysts most closely resembled cysts in prenatal PKD, which 
extended radially from the medulla to the cortex and appeared prominent just beneath the 
nephrogenic zone (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a). Similar cysts were previously 
reported in patients with biallelic mutations in PKD112. In contrast, postnatal cysts from 
patients exhibited a more smooth-edged and multi-layered appearance, and were 
accompanied by interstitial nephritis and inflammatory infiltrates not observed prenatally or 
in organoids (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 2a).
We previously identified Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (LTL) and E-cadherin (ECAD), 
respectively, as markers of organoid proximal and distal tubules in these cultures6. In non-
cystic organoids and tissues, these markers were not mutually exclusive, but rather formed a 
continuum, with enrichment in their respective nephron segments (Supplementary Fig. 2b). 
In PKD organoid cysts, LTL and ECAD largely overlapped within the cyst-lining 
epithelium, exhibiting patches of specific enrichment, whereas PODXL, a marker enriched 
in kidney podocytes, was not detected in cysts, similar to prenatal and postnatal PKD patient 
kidneys (Fig. 2b-c and Supplementary Fig. 2c) 12, 13, 14. Approximately 80 % of organoid 
cysts expressed both LTL and ECAD, which were also detected within the tubular remnants 
continuous with these cysts (Fig. 2b-f and Supplementary Fig. 2c). Cyst-lining cells in 
organoids were heavily coated with primary cilia and formed tight junctions between cells in 
a cobblestone pattern (Fig. 2g). Interestingly, organoid cysts in long-term suspension 
cultures also contained a sub-population of stromal cells that co-expressed smooth muscle 
α-actinin (SMA) and laminin, markers expressed in cystic stroma of PKD patient kidneys 
(Fig. 2h and Supplementary Fig. 2d). Collagen deposition in these cysts remained scant, 
similar to cysts in prenatal PKD kidneys, whereas postnatal PKD kidney cysts exhibited 
prominent fibrosis (Supplementary Fig. 2e). PKD organoid cysts in vitro therefore 
recapitulated hallmark features of PKD patient cysts, particularly the very early stages of 
PKD.
PKD organoid cysts in adherent cultures exhibited a two-fold increase in phosphorylated 
histone H3 (pH3), compared to LTL+ tubular cells from non-mutants, indicating increased 
proliferation (Fig. 3a-b). Similarly, in large cysts in long-term suspension cultures, dividing 
cells were detected within the cyst-lining epithelium and in anaphases oblique and internal 
to the plane of the cyst (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 3a-b, and Movie 3). When large PKD 
cysts were microdissected away from their remnant tubules, they immediately deflated, 
reflecting the loss of accumulated fluid (Fig. 3d). Cysts contained from ∼30,000 to ∼ 
600,000 cells, whereas the original organoids from which they derived contained only∼ 
3,000 cells, indicating extensive proliferation (Fig. 3e). Pathway-based global gene 
expression microarray analysis revealed significant enrichment of hallmark gene sets for cell 
cycle progression, mTOR signaling, and MYC activity in cysts, compared to remnant 
tubules (Fig. 3f). PKD cysts therefore arose from hyperproliferative kidney tubular epithelial 
cells (KTECs), a hallmark of mouse and human ADPKD8, 9, 14, 15.

 The process of purifying organoids and transferring them into suspension might induce cyst 
formation by provoking an injury response16, 17. To test this, organoids were purified and 
immediately replated onto wells coated with a thin layer of extracellular matrix (ECM) but 
lacking stroma. The replated organoids re-adhered but did not form cysts, indicating that 
injury alone was not sufficient to promote cystogenesis (Fig. 4a). Under these conditions, we 
observed that both control and PKD organoids formed expanding cell outgrowths very 
quickly, which could be further expanded as monolayers up to three passages (Fig. 4a and 
Supplementary Fig. 3c). Cells derived from organoid outgrowths exhibited a cobblestone-
like epithelial morphology and predominantly expressed markers specific to KTECs, 
including LTL and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1), similar to flow-sorted LTL+ cells 
from organoid cultures (Fig. 4b-d and Supplementary Fig. 3d-e). Removal of stroma thus 
stimulated proliferation and migration of organoid cells.
We further utilized these organoid KTEC cell lines to investigate the expression of PC1, 
whose structure suggests a possible role in cell adhesion18, 19. In contrast to many cell types, 
KTECs derived from organoid outgrowths expressed sufficient quantities of endogenous 
PC1 to detect in lysates by immunoblot (Fig. 4e) 20, 21. Surprisingly, we found that PC1 
protein was nearly undetectable in KTECs derived from PKD2-/- organoids, using an 
antibody against the amino terminal fragment (Fig. 4e) 22. Undifferentiated PKD2-/- hPSCs 
exhibited a similarly strong decrease in PC1 expression levels (Fig. 4f-g). PKD1 transcripts 
were expressed at normal levels in PKD2-/- hPSCs, suggesting that PC1 loss occurs through 
a post-transcriptional mechanism (Supplementary Fig. 4a-b). Conversely, in PKD1-/- cells, 
PC2 expression levels were unchanged from isogenic controls, although its localization to 
primary cilia was strikingly decreased, consistent with previous reports (Fig. 4f,h and 
Supplementary Fig. 4c-d) 5, 20, 21. Furthermore, treatment of control hPSCs with three 
different siRNAs, which knocked down PC2 protein to 12.6 ± 0.02 % of normal levels (avg. 
± s.e.m.), induced a corresponding decrease in PC1 protein to 30.5 ± 0.03 % of normal 
levels (Fig. 4i-k). These studies revealed, unexpectedly, that PC2 was required for PC1 
amino-terminus expression in human cells, in contrast to reports in mouse Pkd2-/- cells 
20, 21. Differences between species, cell types, or exogenous versus endogenous expression 
levels may account for this discrepancy, as PC1 is a low abundance protein in humans, who 
appear to be highly sensitive to reductions in its expression, compared to mice 6, 7, 23, 24. A 
unifying hypothesis that emerges from these studies is that the ECM microenvironment 
functions to maintain tubular shape and adhesion through interactions involving PC1'slong, 
extracellular domain18, 19, 25. To directly test the effect of PKD mutations on the matrix 
microenvironment, we embedded individual organoids (∼ 250 μm diameter) into larger 
collagen droplets (∼ 4 mm diameter), and placed these in suspension. Droplets implanted 
with organoids did not form cysts, but rather contracted dramatically over a period of 
approximately 1-2 weeks (Fig. 5a). PKD1-/- organoids were quantitatively impaired in their 
ability to compact collagen droplets, compared to isogenic controls (Fig. 5b). Contracted 
droplets comprised an inner core of solid collagen encompassed by a thin, continuous 
epithelium of LTL+ECAD+KTECs (Fig. 5c-d). During the formation of these structures, 
KTECs could be observed migrating out of the implanted organoid to coat the surface of the 
droplet (Fig. 5e). Collagen staining appeared more intense after contraction, and collagen 
fibers appeared denser ultrastructurally, indicating that the changes in droplet size involved

 physical compression (Fig. 5f-g). Collectively, these findings revealed that kidney organoid 
epithelia were capable of dramatically remodeling their ECM microenvironment through 
migratory forces, and that this property was partially dependent on PC1 (Fig. 5h).
Cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling is hypothesized to contribute significantly to PKD, but can 
also promote fluid accumulation in non-PKD epithelia 3, 26. Forskolin, a powerful agonist of 
adenylyl cyclase, induced rapid and dose-dependent swelling of adherent organoids into 
round, cyst-like structures that retained the shape of the original tubules (Supplementary Fig. 
5a-b and Movie 4). The non-degradable cAMP analog 8-Br-cAMP also induced swelling, 
although the effect was much less pronounced (Supplementary Fig. 5b-c). Upon withdrawal 
of these agents, the swollen structures deflated and the organoids returned towards their 
original size (Supplementary Fig. 5a-c). Both PKD and non-PKD organoids swelled and 
deflated to a similar degree after cAMP stimulation, indicating a modifier effect 
(Supplementary Fig. 5a-d and Movie 4). One limitation of this system is that we were unable 
to examine collecting ducts, which are the primary target of cAMP-mediated candidate 
therapeutics10, 27, because these structures do not mature in kidney organoids 6, 28, 29, 30.
In addition to gene-edited mutants, we also investigated the potential of using induced 
pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from PKD patients to model disease 5. We found that 
iPSCs from human patients exhibited dramatic line-to-line variability in their abilities to 
form organoids, regardless of PKD genotype and organoid differentiation protocol 
(Supplementary Fig. 6a-c). The morphology of tubular structures also varied noticeably 
between different lines (Supplementary Fig. 6c). As such differences reflected a degree of 
heterogeneity that would confound analysis of PKD-specific effects, we focused our studies 
on the CRISPR-mutant hPSCs. Although patient-derived organoids presented much 
variability, they could eventually represent valuable tools to develop personalized medicine 
approaches.
In conclusion, by combining PKD organoids with modular physical environments, we have 
established a human cellular system that models PKD with high efficiency and specificity. 
Comparison of PKD and non-PKD organoids suggests a specific, primary role for 
microenvironment and adhesion in early stages of the disease. Interventions that strengthen 
stromal or scaffolding components can provide a critical cue favoring migratory repair over 
cystogenesis. Our biochemical studies indicate a central requirement for PC1, which we 
propose functions as an adhesion regulator that maintains tubular architecture through 
interactions with the microenvironment. The efficiency, specificity, and modularity of 
organoid cultures provide critical insight into the biomaterial basis of human disease, with 
great potential for mechanistic studies and therapeutics development.

 lines were derived from either the WA09 hESC line (WiCell) or the WTC11 iPSC line 
(Gladstone Institute). 60,000 cells from each cell line were plated per well of a 24-well plate 
pre-coated with GelTrex in mTeSR1 supplemented with 10 μM Rho-kinase inhibitor 
Y27632 (StemGent). The media was replaced with 500 μL mTeSR1 + 1.5 % GelTrex at 16 
hours, 500 μL mTeSR1 at 36 hours, Advanced RPMI + Glutamax (from Life Technologies) 
+ 12 μM CHIR99021 (Stemgent) at 50 hours, and RB (Advanced RPMI + Glutamax + B27 
Supplement, from Life Technologies) at 86 hours. RB was changed two days later and every 
three days thereafter. Alternatively (Protocol B, Extended Fig. 5b), undifferentiated hPSCs 
were plated overnight and then treated with 8 μM CHIR99021 in APEL media (Stem Cell 
Technologies) for 48-72 hours, 30 ng/ml FGF9 or FGF2 (Peprotech) + 1 μg/ml heparin 
(Stem Cell Technologies) in APEL for 96 hours, and subsequently cultured in APEL which 
was replaced every three days. Organoids typically became visible by light microscopy 
12-18 days after plating.
Cyst Formation
In adherent cultures (untreated), ‘cysts’ were identified as large, balloon-like, translucent 
structures that swayed in response to agitation. Flat rings and dilated tubules were not 
counted as cysts and occasionally appeared even in non-PKD controls. Forskolin and 8-Br-
cAMP (Sigma) were added to adherent cultures on the 21st day of differentiation, resulting 
in rapid formation of cysts that typically did not sway in response to agitation. Wells were 
imaged using a Nikon TiE inverted widefield microscope and cysts were quantified using 
ImageJ cell counter. To generate large cysts in suspension, adherent organoids were 
microdissected with a 23-gauge syringe needle from 24-well plates on an inverted phase-
contrast microscope, and carefully transferred using a transfer pipette into a low-adhesion 6-
well plate (Corning) containing 2 mL RB. The organoids were isolated on the 21st day of 
differentiation, before cysts formed. RB media was changed by gravity every three days, and 
cystogenesis was assessed at two weeks after replating.
Generation of KTEC lines from organoids
To prepare monolayers of kidney cells for analysis, freshly isolated organoids were 
immediately plated onto tissue culture dishes pre-coated with 1 % GelTrex (Thermo 
Scientific) and cultured for one week in RB, and the resulting epithelial outgrowths were 
processed for immunoblot and immunofluorescence. Alternatively, to isolate KTECs using 
flow cytometry, entire organoid cultures were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated LTL 
(FL-1321, Vector Labs) diluted 1:500 into RB for four hours, dissociated with Accutase, 
pelleted, resuspended in flow sorting buffer: 1 % FBS, 10 mM HEPES buffer in PBS 
(Thermo Scientific). LTL+ cells were isolated on a FACSAria Cell Sorter (BD Biosciences) 
and replated onto GelTrex-coated tissue plates in RB.
Organoid embedding in collagen droplets
To embed organoids in collagen droplets, a sheet of Parafilm was soaked in 70 % ethanol, air 
dried, and pressed against the holes of a box of gel-loading pipette tips (1-200 μl, Fisher 
Scientific 02-707-138) to create a dimpled mold31. One organoid was placed in each dimple 
and 30 μL of 7 mg/mL collagen I (Corning) was added. The droplets were incubated 25 
minutes at 37°C and carefully resuspended in 3 ml of RB media in an untreated 6-well plate.

 The media was changed weekly and the droplets were imaged after 2 weeks of incubation 
using a Nikon Ti Inverted Widefield microscope and a Nikon 1 J1 Camera. Droplet 
diameters were measured using NIS Elements imaging software (Nikon) and normalized to 
the diameter of empty droplets from the same set, for a total of three sets. Droplets that 
failed to undergo compaction (∼ 20 % in control and ∼ 50 % in PKD samples) were 
excluded. Droplets were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room 
temperature, incubated 16 hours in 30 % sucrose (Sigma) in water, mounted in Tissue-Tek 
(Sakura), flash frozen, and cryosectioned onto SuperfrostPlus slides (Fisher). Sections were 
stained in Picro-sirius red solution (Sky-Tek laboratories) for one hour, rinsed in two 
changes of 0.5% acetic acid solution, and dehydrated in two changes of absolute ethanol 
before mounting. Immunofluorescence was performed as described below.
siRNA and Immunoblotting
16 hours after plating, hPSCs were transfected with Dharmacon Smartpool siRNAs (Fisher 
Scientific) directed against PKD2 or scrambled control in mTeSR1 without antibiotics. 
Media was changed 24 hours later. 72 hours after siRNA treatment, cells were lysed in RIPA 
buffer (Thermo Scientific) containing 1× Complete mini EDTA-free protease inhibitor, 
PhosSTOP, and benzonase nuclease (all Sigma). Protein lysates were quantified using a 
BCA protein assay kit (Thermo Fisher). To prepare the samples, 50 μg of protein were 
mixed with Pierce Lane Marker Reducing Sample (Thermo Fisher) and incubated at 40°C 
for 5 minutes. Samples were separated in a 4-20% protein gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred into 
a PVDF membrane using standard protocols and 0.01% SDS in the transfer buffer (0.25M 
Tris Base, 1.92M Glycine, 0.1% SDS). Gels included pre-stained molecular weight markers 
(Precision Plus Protein Kaleidoscope Standards, Bio-Rad), which were annotated manually 
by overlay of the film onto the nitrocellulose membrane. The antibodies used for the 
immunoblots were anti-PC1 (sc-130554, Santa Cruz), anti-PC2 (sc-10376, Santa Cruz) and 
anti-β-actin (4970S, Cell signaling). The intensity ratio of the experimental band to the 
loading control was normalized to 1 in the negative control (unmodified or untreated 
hPSCs). The remaining bands were normalized to the control and averaged for at least three 
independent experiments. Examples of unprocessed immunoblots with the original standards 
hand-marked are provided in Supplementary Fig. 7.
Global Gene Expression and Bioinformatics Analysis
For systems biology analysis of cysts, cystic epithelium or tubule remnants were manually 
separated from PKD1-/- organoids (71-87 days of culture from three experiments) using a 
22-gauge needle under a dissecting microscope and flash frozen separately in liquid 
nitrogen. Total RNA containing small RNA was extracted from seven paired samples (cysts 
and tubule remnants from the same organoid) using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) with an on-
column DNA digestion step to minimize genomic DNA contamination. The sample integrity 
of the RNA was assessed using the RNA 6000 Nano Assay on 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent 
Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) to ensure that RNA integrity number (RIN) was 
greater than 7. Microarray experiments were performed at The Centre for Applied Genomics 
(TCAG) at the Hospital for Sick Children (Toronto, Ontario, Canada). Following the 
manufacturer's protocol, 10 ng of total RNA was labeled using the GeneChip WT Pico 
Reagent Kit (Affymetrix). Fragmented and biotin-labeled ss-cDNAs were then hybridized to

 GeneChip Human Gene 2.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix) for 16 hours at 45°C. Hybridized arrays 
were stained and washed in the Affymetrix Fluidics Station 450. Thereafter, the arrays were 
scanned on an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 and the image (.DAT) files were 
preprocessed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console (AGCC) software v.4.3 to 
generate cell intensity (.CEL) files. After image processing, the array data were uploaded to 
the Affymetrix Expression Console software v1.4.1 for further processing and quality 
control. All quality assessment metrics, including spike-in controls during target preparation 
and hydrization were found within the boundaries. The probe set signal intensities were then 
extracted and normalized using the robust multi-array average (RMA) algorithm embedded 
in the Expression Console software, which consists of convolution background correction, 
quantile normalization, and median polish summarization. Downstream paired sample t-test 
was carried out via Partek Genomics Suite 6.6 (Partek Inc., Chesterfield, MO, USA) to 
determine differentially expressed genes between cysts and tubules. Gene set enrichment 
analysis (GSEA, http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp) was used as the primary 
tool to identify potential gene pathways or gene sets that may modulate cystic kidney 
organoid growth 32. Before running GSEA, Affymetrix probe sets were collapsed to one 
gene level, paired sample t-test statistics scores were used to create a ranked list of genes of 
the entire data set (in total, 29406 unique genes with gene symbols). GSEA was performed 
using the Hallmark gene sets from Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB, http://
software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collections.jsp#H) 33. The description of each gene 
set can be found on MSigDB website. We defined overrepresented gene sets with a FDR ≤ 
0.25. For RNA-Seq analysis of hPSCs, RNA was prepared from isogenic sets of cell lines 
using the RNEasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), checked for high integrity on an Agilent Bioanalyzer, 
prepared using the TruSeq stranded mRNA library kit (Illumina), and sequenced on an 
Illumina NextSeq500 75×75 paired end high output run. Samples were aligned to hg19 
reference sequence.
Immunofluorescence
To fix organoids, an equal volume of 8 % paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences) 
in PBS was added to the culture media (4 % final concentration) for 15 minutes at room 
temperature. After fixing, samples were washed in PBS, blocked in 5 % donkey serum 
(Millipore)/0.3 % Triton-X-100/PBS, and incubated overnight in 3 % bovine serum 
albumin/PBS with primary antibodies. The next day, samples were washed in PBS and 
incubated overnight with Alexa-Fluor secondary antibodies and DAPI (Thermo Scientific), 
followed by PBS washes. For frozen tissue sections, fresh tissues were incubated in 4 % 
paraformaldehyde for one hour at 4°C, incubated 16 hours in 30 % sucrose (Sigma) in water, 
mounted in Tissue-Tek (Sakura), flash frozen, and cryosectioned onto SuperfrostPlus slides 
(Fisher) before blocking. Paraffin sections were prepared by fixing overnight in methacarn 
(60 % absolute methanol, 30 % chloroform, 10 % glacial acetic acid, Sigma) or in 4 % PFA, 
followed by paraffin embedding, sectioning, deparaffinization in 100 % xylene (3 washes 5 
minutes each), dehydration in graded 70 % - 100 % ethanol (5 minutes each), and heating in 
citrate buffer pH 6.0 (Sigma) in a pressure cooker (Instant Pot IPDUO60) for three minutes 
prior to immunostaining. Kidney organoid cysts were embedded in 2 % agarose prior to 
paraffin embedding. Histology stains (Hematoxylin and eosin, or Masson's trichrome) were 
applied to paraffin sections by UW Pathology. Primary antibodies included acetylated alpha-

 tubulin (051M4770; Sigma), ZO-1(339100; Invitrogen), LTL (FL-1321, Vector Labs), PC2 
(sc-25749, Santa Cruz), NPHS1 (R&DAF4269, 1:500), KIM-1 (MAB1750, R&D), PODXL 
(R&DAF1658, 1:500), ECAD (Abcam ab11512), SMA (Sigma A2547, 1:500), LAMA1 
(Sigma L9393a, 1:500), and pH3 (sc-8656, Santa Cruz). Fluorescence images were captured 
using a Nikon epifluorescence 90-I (upright), Nikon Ti Inverted Widefield microscope, or 
Nikon A1R and C1 confocal microscopes. pH3+ cells were scored manually in cysts or 
tubular organoids of similar sizes.
Electron microscopy
Droplets were gently transferred with a cut-off transfer pipette into EM fix: 0.15 M sodium 
cacodylate trihydrate (Sigma) dissolved in water (pH 7.3) containing 4% formaldehyde and 
2% glutaraldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences), and stored overnight. Samples were 
post-fixed with osmium tetroxide solution (Sigma), dehydrated in serial ethanol dilutions 
(Sigma), and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections (80 nm) were mounted on 200 
mesh copper grids and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate (Electron Microscopy 
Sciences). Imaging was performed with a JEOL JEM-1010 TEM and a FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit 
TEM.
PKD patients
All human samples were obtained with informed consent and in compliance with all ethical 
regulations under the auspices of protocols approved by the UW Institutional Review Board. 
These included an ADPKD kidney donated by a 46 yr. female (generous gift of Virginia 
Mason Hospital, Seattle, WA), an anonymized biopsy of a 15 wk control kidney (UW 
Laboratory of Developmental Biology), and anonymized biopsies of kidneys with clinically-
diagnosed Meckel syndrome (20 wk.), ARPKD (29 wk., 6 mo., or 6 yr.), and orofaciodigital 
syndrome (18 yr.) from Seattle Children's Hospital Histopathology. Patients with kidney 
disease were enrolled in our study for the purposes of collecting cells and tissues as positive 
controls. These samples were collected from patients of all ages without any discrimination 
with respect to gender, age, race, family history, or other co-variates. PKD samples were 
chosen from this collection at random and based on availability to represent a range of 
disease severities, ages, and genotypes.
Statistical Analysis
Experiments were performed using a cohort of PKD hPSCs, generated as described 
previously 6, including three PKD1-/-and two PKD2-/- hPSC lines, and a total of six isogenic 
control lines that were subjected to CRISPR mutagenesis but were found to be unmodified at 
the targeted locus. Quantification was performed on experiments performed side-by-side on 
at least three different occasions. Error bars are mean ± standard error (s.e.m.). Statistical 
analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism Software. To test significance, p values 
were calculated using two-tailed, unpaired t test with Welch's correction (unequal variances). 
Statistical significance was defined as p< 0.05. Exact p values, t values and degrees of 
freedom are provided in the figure legends.
