Abstract
Background: Therapies targeting estrogenic stimulation in estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer (BC) reduce
mortality, but resistance remains a major clinical problem. Molecular studies have shown few high-frequency mutations
to be associated with endocrine resistance. In contrast, expression profiling of primary ER+ BC samples has identified
several promising signatures/networks for targeting.
Methods: To identify common adaptive mechanisms associated with resistance to aromatase inhibitors (AIs), we
assessed changes in global gene expression during adaptation to long-term estrogen deprivation (LTED) in a panel of
ER+ BC cell lines cultured in 2D on plastic (MCF7, T47D, HCC1428, SUM44 and ZR75.1) or in 3D on collagen (MCF7) to
model the stromal compartment. Furthermore, dimethyl labelling followed by LC-MS/MS was used to assess global
changes in protein abundance. The role of target genes/proteins on proliferation, ER-mediated transcription and
recruitment of ER to target gene promoters was analysed.
Results: The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was the common upregulated pathway in the ER+ LTED but not the
ER– LTED cell lines, suggesting a potential mechanism dependent on continued ER expression. Targeting the individual
genes of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with siRNAs caused a 30–50 % drop in proliferation. Further analysis
showed increased expression of 25-hydroxycholesterol (HC) in the MCF7 LTED cells. Exogenous 25-HC or 27-HC
increased ER-mediated transcription and expression of the endogenous estrogen-regulated gene TFF1 in ER+ LTED
cells but not in the ER– LTED cells. Additionally, recruitment of the ER and CREB-binding protein (CBP) to the TFF1 and
GREB1 promoters was increased upon treatment with 25-HC and 27-HC. In-silico analysis of two independent studies of
primary ER+ BC patients treated with neoadjuvant AIs showed that increased expression of MSMO1, EBP, LBR and SQLE
enzymes, required for cholesterol synthesis and increased in our in-vitro models, was significantly associated with poor
response to endocrine therapy.
Conclusion: Taken together, these data provide support for the role of cholesterol biosynthesis enzymes and the
cholesterol metabolites, 25-HC and 27-HC, in a novel mechanism of resistance to endocrine therapy in ER+ BC
that has potential as a therapeutic target.

 Background
Over 80 % of breast cancers (BCs) express estrogen re-
ceptor alpha (ER) at primary diagnosis. ER is a transcrip-
tion factor that controls proliferation and survival by
binding and activating estrogen response elements (ERE)
on target genes controlling proliferation and survival.
Current clinical strategies include the use of endocrine
agents, which inhibit estrogen (E) signalling either by
blocking the conversion of androgens to E in the case of
aromatase inhibitors (AIs), by directly antagonizing ER
function with agents such as tamoxifen, which compete
with E for the ER and results in the recruitment of
nuclear corepressors, or by use of drugs such as fulves-
trant (ICI182780), which targets ER for proteasomal
degradation [1–4].
Despite the efficacy of endocrine therapies, many pa-
tients relapse with either de-novo or acquired resistance
[4–6]. Preclinical and clinical data support cross-talk
between ER and growth factor receptor pathways, such
as IGF1R and ERBB2/HER2 [7–10], which can lead to
ligand-independent activation of the ER or can alter the
phosphorylation state of nuclear co-activators, thereby
changing the balance of ER transcription factors and
potentiating transcription [11]. Despite this knowledge,
few clinical trials have shown benefit from the targeting
of endocrine resistance using signal transduction or
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. One explanation for
this is the complexity/heterogeneity of the tumour back-
ground and the lack of definitive biomarkers. Data from
large studies such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
indicate that other than a small number of high-frequency
mutations, such as TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3, which
have little association with endocrine resistance [12], pri-
mary ER+ BC shows a very low frequency of individual
mutations, making targeting difficult. In contrast, expres-
sion profiling of primary ER+ BC samples has identified
several promising signatures/networks for targeting [13].
Previously, using global gene expression data from pa-
tients treated with neoadjuvant anastrozole, we showed
that certain gene signatures such as IGF-1, MAPK and
obesity were associated with poor response to therapy
[13]. In order to identify common adaptive pathways as-
sociated with acquired resistance to AIs, we derived a
panel of cell lines modelling resistance to E-deprivation
and analysed these using both high-throughput transcrip-
tomic and proteomic data. The cholesterol biosynthesis
pathway was identified as a common adaptive mechanism
only in models that retained ER at the point of resistance.
Of particular note, the oxysterols 25-hydroxycholesterol
(HC) and 27-HC were shown to influence ER transcrip-
tional activity via recruitment to endogenous E-regulated
genes. Furthermore, in-silico interrogation of data from
two separate patient cohorts treated with neoadjuvant AIs
or adjuvant tamoxifen showed that genes identified within
our in-vitro models encoding enzymes within the choles-
terol biosynthesis pathway were associated with poor out-
come. Overall, these data provide further links between
obesity and BC risk.
Materials and methods
Cell culture
All wild-type (wt) cell lines (MCF7, HCC1428, SUM44,
T47D, ZR75.1) were cultured in phenol red-free RPMI sup-
plemented with 10 % FBS and 1 nM estradiol (E2). Long-
term oestrogen-deprivation (LTED) cell lines were cultured
in phenol red-free RPMI in the absence of exogenous E2
and supplemented with 10 % dextran charcoal-stripped
bovine serum (DCC) [14]. Samples were harvested at base-
line, 1 week post E-deprivation and at the point of resist-
ance (LTED). To model the tumour microenvironment
during acquisition of resistance to LTED, wt-MCF7 cells
were grown on collagen (3 mg/ml) and were referred to as
3D culture.
Gene expression analysis
RNA was extracted using RNeasy columns (Qiagen,
Crawley, UK), according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
RNA amplification, labelling and hybridization were
conducted on HumanHT-12_V4 Expression BeadChips
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), according to the manu-
facturer’s
instructions.
Data
were
normalized
using
variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) and robust
spline normalization (RSN) in the Lumi package [15]
[GEO Accession number, GSE75971]. Each triangular
comparison per cell line was normalized separately. Probes
that were not detected in any sample (detection p > 0.01)
were discarded. Triangular pairwise comparisons were
carried out using BRB-ArrayTools [16]. Differentially
expressed probes were considered using the following
criteria: False Discovery Rate (FDR) < 5 %, unadjusted
p < 0.001 and absolute fold-change ≥1.5. Pathway analyses
were performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).
Proteomics
Peptides from wt-MCF7 and MCF7 LTED cells were iso-
topically labelled directly using Sep-pak C18 cartridges, as
described previously [17, 18]. The wt cells were labelled
with the medium isotope reagent and the MCF7 LTED
cells with the light isotope reagent. After labelling, each
sample was eluted using 80 % acetonitrile with 2 % formic
acid. Subsequently, the two labelled samples were pooled at
an approximate 1:1 ratio and dried down under vacuum.
The dried sample was reconstituted in OFFGEL (OGE,
Agilent 3100 OFFGEL Fractionator Kit) stock solution and
run using 12 cm IPG strip pH 3–10. Fractions were
desalted (SUM SS18V; The Nest Group Inc., Southbor-
ough, MA, USA) and run through liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using LTQ Velos

 Orbitrap MS. For MS analysis, the data acquisition mode
was set to acquire one full-scan spectrum (350–1850 m/z).
After a survey scan, the 20 most intense precursor ions
were selected for subsequent fragmentation. For collision-
induced dissociation, normalized collision energy was set
to 35 %, q value to 0.25 and activation time to 10 ms. The
isolation width was set to 1.5 and the dynamic exclusion to
1. Raw data were processed using MaxQuant 1.5.1.0 follow-
ing guidelines by the developers [19–21]. Light and
medium dimethyl labels (+28.0313 Da and +32.0564 Da,
respectively) were searched at lysine residues and peptide
N-termini. Resulting peptide and protein lists were filtered
to an estimated FDR of 1 % and 5 %, respectively. Search
parameters were chosen as follows: carbamidomethylation
was set as a fixed modification on all cysteines. Oxidation
of methionines and N-acetylation were considered variable
modifications. Precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 20
ppm for the first search and fragment ion mass tolerance
was set to 0.6 Da. The ‘Re-quantify’ and ‘match between
runs’ options were enabled. The automatic decoy search
option was also enabled. Spectra were searched for a match
to fully-tryptic peptides with up to two missed cleavage
sites. All proteomics data are deposited with the PRIDE
database with the accession number PXD004085.
Proliferation assays
Cells were seeded in 10 % DCC into 96-well tissue culture
plates and allowed to acclimatize overnight. To assess re-
sponse of the LTED lines in the presence of estrogen,
monolayers were treated with 10 % DCC with or without
the presence of escalating concentrations of E2. The
medium was replaced after 3 days and cells were cultured
for a total of 6 days. For the siRNA knockdown studies,
cells were seeded in 10 % DCC and transfected with sicon-
trol (non-targeting pool) or siRNA targeting MSMO1,
IDI1, SQLE, and EBP (ON-TARGETplus siRNA; GE Dhar-
macon, Little Chalfont, Buckingshire, UK) using lipofecta-
mine RNAimax (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY, USA) [22],
according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After 24 hours,
monolayers were then treated with 10 % DCC with or
without the presence of 1 nM E2 and cells cultured for a
total of 6 days. Each experiment was performed at least
twice with eight replicates per treatment. To assess the ef-
fect of oxysterols or cholesterol, wt-MCF7 cells were
stripped from E2 for 72 hours. They were then seeded into
96-well plates and were allowed to acclimatize for 24
hours. The medium was changed on day 3. The cells were
treated for 6 days. Cell viability was determined using the
CellTitre-Glo® Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega,
Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer’s
protocol. Values were expressed as fold-change relative to
the vehicle-treated control. As a secondary analysis, abso-
lute cell number was also assessed using coulter counts,
as described previously [23].
Transcription assays
The wt cells were stripped of E2 as described previously
and seeded into 24-well plates [24]. The following day, the
cells were transfected with an ERE-linked luciferase re-
porter (EREtkLuc) and β-galactosidase constructs using
Fugene® 6 (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) [24]. The lucifer-
ase
activity
(Promega,
Madison,
WI,
USA)
and
β-
galactosidase (GalactoStar; Applied Biosystems, Paisley,
Scotland, UK) were measured using a luminometer. Each
experiment was performed in triplicate and the luciferase
values were normalized to the β-galactosidase.
Western blot
Protein extracts were generated as described previously
[23]. Equal amounts of protein (25 μg) were resolved by
SDS-PAGE and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Anti-
gen–antibody interactions were detected with ECL reagent
(Amersham, Amersham, UK). Proteins were detected
using the following antibodies: ER (sc-8002; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA) and α-tubulin (Sigma-
Aldrich, Poole, Dorset, UK). Secondary antibodies were
used at concentration of 1/2000 (Dako, Denmark).
Quantitative RT-PCR
RNA was extracted 24 hours after treatments using RNeasy
columns and quantification was performed using a Nano-
Drop 1000 spectrometer. cDNA was generated using the
SuperScript III First Strand Synthesis System for RT-PCR
(Invitrogen). cDNA was subjected to quantitative PCR in
triplicate (Applied Biosystems, Paisley, Scotland, UK). Taq-
man gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems, Paisley,
Scotland, UK) were used for TFF1 (Hs00907239_m1) to-
gether with FKBP15 (Hs00391480_m1) as the housekeep-
ing gene, to normalize the data. The relative quantity was
determined using ΔΔCt.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation quantitative PCR
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were
performed, as described previously [25]. Cells were syn-
chronized with α-amanitin [26] and then treated for 45
minutes with 27-HC or 25-HC (10 μM) [27] and fixed.
The antibodies used were anti-ER (sc-543 X; Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA), anti-CBP (sc-369 X;
Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, Texas, USA) and mouse
IgG1 (Dako). The resulting DNA was subjected to quanti-
tative PCR analysis using SYBR green (Applied Biosys-
tems, Paisley, Scotland, UK) with the following primers:
for TFF1, forward 5′-GGC CAT CTC TCA CTA TGA
ATC ACT TCT GCA-3′ and reverse 5′-GGC AGG CTC
TGT TTG CTT AAA GAG CGT TAG-3′; and for
GREB1, forward 5′-GAA GGG CAG AGC TGA TAA
CG-3′ and reverse 5′-GAC CCA GTT GCC ACA CTT
TT-3′.

 Estradiol assay
E2 was measured in whole cell extracts and in cell culture
media from the target cell lines using a radioimmunoassay
with minor modifications. The intra-assay and inter-assay
coefficient of variation (CV) for E2 at a mean of 32 pmol/l
was 12 % and 20 %, respectively [28].
Oxysterol measurements
Cells were grown under basic conditions up to 70–80 %
confluency, harvested and cell numbers counted using
a Beckman coulter counter. Cells were then pelleted
and resuspended in 300 μl ice-cold ultra-pure ethanol
(Rathburn Chemicals Ltd, Walkerburn, Peeblesshire, UK)
containing 400 nM cholesterol-25,26,27-13C3. Oxysterols
were quantified as described previously [29].
In-silico modelling analysis of 25-HC and 27-HC
Docking of 27-HC and 25-HC was carried out using
SwissDock [30, 31] to obtain docking orientations. The
most favourable orientation in the ER ligand-binding do-
main (LBD) was selected. Slight manual manipulation
was performed to obtain a better correlation between
the binding of E2 and 27-HC or 25-HC within the bind-
ing pocket, as well as similar hydrogen bonding.
Clinical analysis
The clinical relevance of the observations made in this
study was tested in two clinical cohorts of patients with
primary ER+ BC treated with neoadjuvant anastrozole
[32, 33] or letrozole [34]. In the first study, response was
based on the Ki67 value less than 10 % after 2 weeks of
therapy [12, 35]. In the second study, a reduction in
tumour volume of ≥50 % was defined as response [34].
p values were calculated using the Mann–Whitney U
test with p < 0.05 regarded as significant. Spearman’s rank
correlation was used for the associations between on-
treatment gene expression and 2-week Ki67 protein
expression. All p values reported are two tailed.
To test the impact in patients treated with tamoxifen, we
generated an integrated BC cohort of 747 unique baseline
sample profiles based on four publicly available gene expres-
sion
datasets
(GSE6532,
GSE9195,
GSE17705
and
GSE26971). All samples were from patients with ER+,
HER2–, tamoxifen-treated (followed by AIs in some cases)
disease, without chemotherapy and with follow-up informa-
tion of relapse-free survival (RFS) up to 10 years. The raw
data were normalized on an Affymetrix platform basis: HG-
U133A; or HG-U133plus2 using just the MAS function
from the simpleaffy R package (http://www.bioconductor.
org/) to a mean target intensity of 600, without background
correction. The two normalized datasets were then merged
and the batch effects across the cohorts were corrected
using the ComBat from Surrogate Variable Analysis (sva) R
package. Significant impact on RFS was assumed with log-
rank p < 0.05. The samples were stratified into two groups
by the median of gene expression.
The same parameters were used to evaluate the chol-
esterol biosynthesis genes on 496 ER– patients treated
with chemotherapy, excluding endocrine therapy [36]. A
significant impact on RFS was assumed to be present
with log-rank p < 0.05.
Results
Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis showed
upregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was
restricted to ER+ LTED cells
To
identify
novel
mechanisms
of
resistance
to
E-
deprivation, we first generated five LTED cell lines. wt-
MCF7, wt-ZR75.1, wt-T47D, wt-HCC1428 and wt-SUM44
cells were cultured in the absence of E2 until their growth
rate was shown to be independent of the exogenous E2
(Fig. 1a). At the point of resistance, ZR75.1 LTED and
T47D LTED cells lost expression of ER whilst MCF7
LTED, SUM44 LTED and HCC1428 LTED cells retained
or even upregulated ER expression (Fig. 1b). Pellets derived
from the wt cells (representing primary diagnosis) 1-week
post E2-deprivation (representing clinical response to AI
therapy) and LTED (modelling relapse on an AI) were har-
vested and global gene expression was interrogated for
each cell line using a triangular pairwise comparison (FDR
< 5 %, univariate p < 0.001 and absolute fold-change ≥1.5)
(Fig. 1c). Varying numbers of genes were altered at each
time point and differed among cell types, indicating hetero-
geneity in response to E2-deprivation (Additional file 1:
Table S1). As noted previously, comparison between gene
changes in wt cells and those deprived of E2 for 1 week
were dominated by proliferation, as was the comparison
between 1-week deprivation and LTED [24]. We therefore
restricted our pathway analysis to comparison of the wt cell
lines with their corresponding LTED derivative, in order to
remove the confounding effect of proliferation. To identify
common
adaptive
pathways,
the
IPA
software
was
employed. Strikingly, the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway
(Additional file 2: Figure S1) [37–40] was upregulated ex-
clusively in all LTED derivatives that retained expression of
ER both in 2D and 3D culture (Table 1). Further interroga-
tion of the gene expression data showed that genes encod-
ing enzymes within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway
were increased significantly (Additional file 3: Table S2).
As protein and mRNA expression is often disconnected,
we carried out quantitative proteomic analysis of wt-MCF7
and MCF7 LTED cells using chemical labelling [17, 18].
Approximately 5000 proteins were identified and 1009
were upregulated in the MCF7 LTED cells compared with
wt-MCF7 (Fig. 1d) using the following filter: FDR ≤ 5 %
and absolute fold-change ≥1.5. Within the proteins identi-
fied were ESR1, in keeping with our western blot analysis,
together with GREB1, TFF1 and GATA3 (Additional file 4:
Simigdala et al. Breast Cancer Research  (2016) 18:58 
Page 4 of 14
 Table S3). Pathway analysis confirmed the upregulation of
the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway in the MCF7 LTED
cells (Additional file 5: Table S4). In particular, enzymes
such as sterol 8-isomerase (EBP) (fold-change wt/LTED
= –1.54), Lamin-B receptor (LBR) (fold-change wt/LTED
= –1.86) and squalene epoxidase (SQLE) (fold-change wt/
LTED = –3.2) were evident (Fig. 1d).
Cholesteryl esters are not associated with the LTED
phenotype
Cholesterol plays a major role in both metabolism and cel-
lular architecture. Recent studies have provided a role for
cholesteryl esters fuelling the mechanism of invasion and
migration and have been associated with more aggressive
tumour phenotypes. In particular, recent evidence has

 provided a link between accumulation of cholesteryl esters
and loss of PTEN or hyperactivation of the PI3K/AKT/
mTOR axis [41, 42]. Upregulation of the PI3K pathway has
been associated with resistance to E2-deprivation [43], so we
hypothesized that accumulation of cholesteryl esters may be
associated with the LTED phenotype. However, assessment
of the gene and protein expression of acetyl-CoA acetyltrans-
ferase (ACAT1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reduc-
tase (HMGCR), sterol regulatory element-binding protein

 [41, 44] – central mediators of this pathway – showed that
they were either undetected or downregulated (Additional
file 6: Tables S5 and Additional file 7: Tables S6).
25-HC and 27-HC enhance ER-mediated transcription in
the ER+ LTED models
We hypothesized that the upregulation of the cholesterol
biosynthesis pathway may be related to E2 signalling, since
cholesterol is the master precursor of the sterol synthesis
cascade. To address this, we measured the intracellular as
well as the secreted E2 levels in the LTED cell lines; however,
in both cases E2 levels were less than 3pmol. Furthermore,
exogenous cholesterol showed no impact on ER-mediated
transcription in our LTED models (data not shown).
Recent findings have suggested that cholesterol metab-
olites, such as 27-HC, can act as endogenous ligands for
ER [45–47]. In order to investigate this further, we
assessed the effect of 25-HC and 27-HC on ER-mediated
transcription. wt-MCF7 and MCF7 LTED cells were
transfected with an EREtkLuc linked reporter construct
and treated with E2, 25-HC and 27-HC alone or in com-
bination with fulvestrant (ICI182780). Both oxysterols
increased ER-mediated transcription 2-fold (p < 0.002) in
the MCF7 LTED but had no effect in wt-MCF7. Further-
more, addition of the pure anti-estrogen fulvestrant,
which leads to degradation of ER, suppressed oxysterol-
driven ER transactivation (Fig. 2a). These data were con-
firmed in a separate cell line model, HCC1428 LTED
(Fig. 2b), but were not evident in ZR75.1 LTED, which
had lost expression of ER (Fig. 2c). Taken together, these
data suggest that oxysterols can bind and activate ER.
25-HC and 27-HC show selective estrogen receptor
modulator activity and can rescue the anti-proliferative
effects of fulvestrant
To assess the effect of 25-HC and 27-HC on the prolifera-
tion of both wt-MCF7 and MCF7 LTED, cells were treated
with escalating (Log10M) concentrations of E2 or the oxy-
sterols. As expected, E2 caused a concentration-dependent
increase in proliferation of wt-MCF7 cells but neither 25-
HC nor 27-HC showed any significant impact on prolifera-
tion when cell viability was measured as the output cri-
terion. In contrast, assessment of absolute cell number
showed a small but significant increase (1.4-fold; p =
0.0001) in response to 27-HC (Fig. 3b). Of note,
addition of 27-HC and 25-HC to E2 showed an antag-
onistic effect, suggesting that the oxysterols had weak se-
lective
estrogen
receptor
modulator
(SERM)
activity
(Fig. 3a), an observation supported by previous findings
[27, 45, 48]. Despite the effect on transcription, proliferation
of MCF7 LTED cells was unchanged by addition of E2, 25-
HC or 27-HC when measured using cell viability (Fig. 3c).
In contrast, assessment of changes in absolute cell number
revealed a small but significant increase in response to 25-
HC and 27-HC (1.3-fold, p = 0.01 and p = 0.003, respect-
ively) (Fig. 3d). To investigate this further, we assessed the
ability of both 25-HC and 27-HC to rescue the anti-
proliferative effect of fulvestrant in the MCF7 LTED
(Fig. 3e). As shown previously [23], fulvestrant caused a
concentration-dependent decrease in proliferation with an
IC50 of 0.1 nM. The addition of either of the oxysterols
shifted the fulvestrant dose–response curve to the left ap-
proximately 10-fold (approximately IC50 = 1 nM), suggesting
that the oxysterols effectively rescued proliferation (Fig. 3e).
One explanation for the observed results was that the
ER+ LTED cells synthesized increased levels of 25-HC
and 27-HC, leading to increased ER activity in response
to loss of the E2 proliferative signal. To address this, we
measured the intracellular levels of the oxysterols using
LC-MS/MS. There was a significant increase in the
levels of 25-HC in the MCF7 LTED compared with their
corresponding parental cell line (Fig. 3f). Furthermore,
using the crystal structure of the Activation Function 2
(AF2) [49] domain of ER, which incorporates the LBD,
both 25-HC and 27-HC were successfully docked and were
superimposed on E2, supporting this hypothesis (Fig. 3g).
Treatment with 25-HC or 27-HC increases TFF1 mRNA
expression, as a result of enhanced ER recruitment
To assess this hypothesis further, we measured the effect
of exogenous 25-HC and 27-HC on the expression of
TFF1, an endogenous E-regulated gene. TFF1 was in-
creased in MCF7 LTED cells in response to both oxy-
sterols, whilst having no effect on TFF1 expression in
wt-MCF7 (Fig. 4a). ChIP of ER and its co-activator CBP
in response to both 25-HC and 27-HC showed enhanced
recruitment to both the TFF1 and GREB1 EREs in the
MCF7 LTED cells (Fig. 4b, c).
Enzymes controlling 25-HC and 27-HC synthesis are
associated with poor clinical response in ER+ BC patients
To assess the clinical relevance of each of the cholesterol
biosynthesis enzymes identified within our transcriptomic
and proteomic analysis, we used publicly available datasets
for ER+ BC patients treated with neoadjuvant anastrozole
[33] or letrozole [34]. Clinical response data were available
for 72 patients treated with anastrozole, of which 55 were
classed as responders based on a 2-week residual Ki67
score <10 % [12, 35] and 17 were classified as non-
responders. In this setting, on-treatment gene expression
of EBP (p = 0.0051) and LBR (p = 0.0016) were significantly
associated with poor response to anastrozole, while the
other two candidate genes showed no significant difference
(Fig. 5a). We also found that increased on-treatment gene
expression of MSMO1 (p = 0.0019), LBR (p = 0.0270)
and EBP (p = 0.0027) correlated with higher Ki67 ex-
pression after 2 weeks of therapy, when expressed as a

 continuous variable (Fig. 5b). In the second cohort, data
were available for 52 tumours, of which 37 were classified
as responders on the basis of tumour shrinkage ≥50 %. In-
creased on-treatment expression of methylsterol monooxy-
genase 1 (MSMO1) (p = 0.0404) and SQLE (p = 0.0381) was
strongly associated with poor response to letrozole (Fig. 5c).
We next assessed whether expression of these genes was
also related to long-term outcome on adjuvant tamoxifen.
After 10 years of follow-up of 747 ER+ patients treated
with tamoxifen, only SQLE (p = 5 × 10–6) was strongly
associated with poor RFS (Fig. 5d). Finally, we assessed
the expression of the genes in a cohort of ER– patients
treated with chemotherapy and found no significant re-
lationship between expression of the four genes and
RFS (Additional file 8: Figure S2A).

contrast, MCF7 LTED showed a 30 % drop in response to
siMSMO1 and siSQLE and an approximately 50 % drop in
response to siLBR and siEBP. Wt-MCF7 showed no signifi-
cant decrease in response to siMSMO1, LBR or siSQLE but

Discussion
Despite the success of AIs in treating patients with ER+
BC and reducing their risk of dying from the disease, re-
sistance remains a significant problem [50]. To study
novel mechanisms of resistance to E-deprivation on an
AI, we generated a panel of cell line models with varying
genetic backgrounds and interrogated alterations in both
their global gene transcriptome and proteome. Our main
focus was to identify common adaptive mechanisms of
resistance. Using pathway analysis, we showed a con-
cordant upregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis
pathway
in
our
LTED
models
that
retained
ER
expression but not in those that lost expression of the
steroid receptor.
Evidence suggests both primary and recurrent tumour
cells have a high demand of lipids in order to proliferate
and metastasize [44]. For instance, activation of the PI3K/
AKT/mTOR pathway is strongly associated with lipogen-
esis [44, 51, 52], as well as accumulation of cholesteryl es-
ters in various cancers via SREBP1 and LDLR activation
[41]. In this setting, hyperactivation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR
pathway activates SREBP1, thereby potentiating esterifica-
tion and compartmentalization of cholesterol into lipid
droplets, allowing uptake of fatty acids and leading to
increased proliferation [42]. As 40 % of BCs harbour acti-
vating mutation/amplification of PIK3CA or loss of PTEN,
a feature modelled in our ER+ LTED cell lines, we

 assessed mRNA levels of SREBP1, LDLR and HMGCR.
However, expression at the transcript or protein was ei-
ther undetected or downregulated. Additionally, ACAT1,
which is important for cholesterol esterification and pre-
vents cellular toxicity of excess cholesterol, was less abun-
dant in the LTED at both the mRNA and protein level.
Furthermore, the levels of esterified cholesterol were not
significantly different between wt and LTED cells (data
not shown), suggesting this axis is less important in the
ER+ LTED phenotype.
There is compelling evidence for the role of cholesterol
metabolites in promoting tumour growth [45, 47, 53, 54]
and acting as endogenous SERMS [27, 46]. In particu-
lar, it has been hypothesized that 27-HC may be the
primary biochemical link between lipid metabolism
and cancer [55]. We showed that both 25-HC and 27-
HC were elevated in our ER+ LTED models compared
with their parental controls. Of note, addition of both
oxysterols promoted ER-mediated transcription and
enhanced recruitment of ER to EREs on both TFF1
and GREB1, two E-regulated genes. Furthermore, this
process was antagonized by fulvestrant, suggesting a
mechanism dependent on a functional ER-transcription
axis. We hypothesized that both 25-HC and 27-HC may
substitute for E2 in the LTED setting, a notion supported
by our in-silico analysis, which showed that both oxyster-
ols were capable of binding with the LBD located in the
AF2 domain of ER.
Obesity and lipogenesis have been associated with
increased BC risk and a worse outcome as a result of
increased levels of adipocyte-secreted endocrine fac-
tors and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) [56, 57].
Previously, we showed that gene signatures modelling
both obesity and IGF signalling predicted a poor anti-
proliferative
effect
of
anastrozole
[13].
To
assess
whether these enzymes within the cholesterol biosyn-
thesis pathway had relevance for clinical response or
prognosis of ER+ BC treated with endocrine therapy
that were upregulated in our ER+ LTED models, we in-
terrogated in-silico data from patients treated with
neoajuvant AI therapy or adjuvant tamoxifen. These
analyses revealed that higher expression of four of the
nine upregulated genes (MSMO1, EBP, LBR and SQLE)
correlated with poor response to AI therapy judged
either by clinical response [34] or by the validated
response biomarker Ki67 [12, 35], but only SQLE
associated with poor response to endocrine therapy or
poor long-term outcome on such therapy or both. Pre-
vious studies have shown that SQLE is amplified in 10
% of BC [58] and that high expression is associated
with poor prognosis in early-stage ER+ BC [59]. Stud-
ies have shown that the 8p11-p12 chromosomal region
is a hotspot for genomic aberrations and that co-
amplification with the MYC oncogene (8q24.21) as
well as altered transcriptional patterns (hypomethyla-
tion) of genes spanning 8q12.1-q24.22, which includes
SQLE, is associated with more aggressive tumours [60].
Taken together, this would suggest SQLE is indicative
of poor prognosis while the other cholesterol biosyn-
thesis genes associate more strongly and specifically
with poor response to AI therapy. Of note, some genes
involved in cholesterol biosynthesis are already incor-
porated in clinically relevant gene signatures. For in-
stance, DHCR7, which was more abundant in our
MCF7 LTED cells (1.25-fold, p < 0.001) but did not
meet our stringent selection criteria, forms part of the
eight-gene EndoPredict signature [61].
Conclusion
Taken together, these data highlight once again the im-
portance of cholesterol biosynthesis in BC progression
and the link with obesity as a marker of increased BC
risk and poor outcome on AI therapy [62]. Our observa-
tions suggest that enzymes within the cholesterol bio-
synthesis pathway may be associated with acquired
resistance to AI therapy. Clinical measurement, either by
gene expression of pertinent enzymes within this com-
plex network or by the assessment of 27-HC and 25-
HC, may prove informative biomarkers. Our study high-
lights the need to evaluate the lowering of cholesterol on
the impact of endocrine therapy.
