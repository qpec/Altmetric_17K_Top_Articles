European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
point-prevalence survey

Summary
Background In 2011–12, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) held the fi
 rst Europe-wide 
point-prevalence survey of health-care-associated infections in acute care hospitals. We analysed paediatric data from 
this survey, aiming to calculate the prevalence and type of health-care-associated infections in children and adolescents 
in Europe and to determine risk factors for infection in this population.
Methods Point-prevalence surveys took place from May, 2011, to November, 2012, in 1149 hospitals in EU Member 
States, Iceland, Norway, and Croatia. Patients present on the ward at 0800 h on the day of the survey and who were not 
discharged at the time of the survey were included. Data were collected by locally trained health-care workers 
according to patient-based or unit-based protocols. We extracted data from the ECDC database for all paediatric 
patients (age 0–18 years). We report adjusted prevalence for health-care-associated infections by clustering at the 
hospital and country level. We also calculated risk factors for development of health-care-associated infections with 
use of a generalised linear mixed-eff
 ects model.
Findings We analysed data for 17 273 children and adolescents from 29 countries. 770 health-care-associated infections 
were reported in 726 children and adolescents, corresponding to a prevalence of 4·2% (95% CI 3·7–4·8). 
Bloodstream infections were the most common type of infection (343 [45%] infections), followed by lower respiratory 
tract infections (171 [22%]), gastrointestinal infections (64 [8%]), eye, ear, nose, and throat infections (55 [7%]), 
urinary tract infections (37 [5%]), and surgical-site infections (34 [4%]). The prevalence of infections was highest in 
paediatric intensive care units (15·5%, 95% CI 11·6–20·3) and neonatal intensive care units (10·7%, 9·0–12·7). 
Independent risk factors for infection were age younger than 12 months, fatal disease (via ultimately and rapidly fatal 
McCabe scores), prolonged length of stay, and the use of invasive medical devices. 392 microorganisms were reported 
for 342 health-care-associated infections, with Enterobacteriaceae being the most frequently found (113 [15%]).
Interpretation Infection prevention and control strategies in children should focus on prevention of bloodstream 
infections, particularly among neonates and infants.
Funding None.
Introduction
For many years, point-prevalence surveys have been used 
for surveillance of health-care-associated infections.1 The 
pioneering project Study on the Effi
  cacy of Nosocomial 
Infection Control (SENIC), initiated in the 1970s by the 
US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 
used repeated point-prevalence surveys to study the 
benefi
 t of establishing infection prevention and control 
teams in US hospitals.2 In the following years, the US 
National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) 
system established prospective surveillance for health-
care-associated infections in intensive care units, which 
was adopted for use by national surveillance networks in 
other countries. Incidence surveillance has become the 
gold standard for surveillance of health-care-associated 
infections in high-risk specialties such as intensive care, 
oncology, or neonatal care, and for selected infections 
such as ventilator-associated pneumonia and catheter-
associated urinary tract and bloodstream infections. 
However, incidence surveillance is almost never done for 
all infection types because it is cumbersome and 
resource-demanding. Point-prevalence surveys off
 er an 
alternative method to incidence surveillance to estimate 
the hospital-wide burden of health-care-associated 
infections within a reasonable budget.1 Thus, they can be 
used a wider range of settings including institutes with 
limited resources and allow broader comparison of rates 
across a wider range of sociocultural contexts.
In July, 2008, the coordination of the European Union 
(EU)-funded network Improving Patient Safety in 
Europe 
(IPSE) 
and 
its 
surveillance 
component 
(previously Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection 
Control through Surveillance [HELICS]) were transferred 
to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control (ECDC) to form a new surveillance network 
(HAI-Net), which, in 2009, started planning the fi
 rst

EU-wide 
point-prevalence 
survey 
of 
health-care-
associated infec 
tions and antimicrobial use in acute care 
hospitals.3
In 2011–12, the EU Member States, Iceland, Norway, 
and Croatia participated in this ECDC point-prevalence 
survey. Data for 273 753 patients from 1149 hospitals were 
submitted to ECDC and, to obtain similar precision in 
health-care-associated infections prevalence estimates 
for all participating countries, a representative subsample 
of hospitals was drawn from the data for countries that 
were over-represented such as Belgium, Portugal, and 
Spain. 231 459 patients from 947 hospitals remained in 
the fi
 nal ECDC database.3 The prevalence of patients 
with one or more health-care-associated infections was 
6·0% (country range 2·3–10·8%).3 When extrapolated to 
the average daily number of occupied beds per country, 
the adjusted overall prevalence of health-care-associated 
infections was estimated to be 5·7% (95% CI 4·5–7·4). 
The most frequent types of infections were lower 
respiratory tract infections (pneumonia and other lower 
respiratory tract infections), followed by surgical-site 
infections, urinary tract infections, bloodstream infec-
tions, and gastrointestinal infections.3
In this Article, we present results of an analysis of data 
from paediatric patients who were enrolled in the ECDC 
point-prevalence survey. We aimed to calculate the 
prevalence of health-care-associated infections among 
hospitalised children and adolescents in Europe; to 
describe the distribution of types of health-care-
associated infections in diff
 erent paediatric settings and 
age groups; and to determine risk factors for health-care-
associated infections among hospitalised children and 
adolescents in Europe.
Methods
The ECDC point-prevalence survey
National contact-points in EU Member States, Iceland, 
Norway, and Croatia agreed to organise a point-prevalence 
survey of health-care-associated infections and anti-
microbial use in acute care hospitals in their country 
based on a standardised study protocol developed by 
ECDC.4 These surveys took place on one day during one 
of the following periods: May to June, 2011, September to 
October, 2011, May to June, 2012, and September to 
November, 2012. These periods were chosen to fall 
outside winter (when there is a higher antimicrobial use) 
and outside summer (when there is a lower staffi
  ng rate). 
Countries had to organise their national surveys in one 
of the specifi
 ed periods. The choice of the period was free 
depending on national priorities and work plans. Each 
country defi
 ned their own start date which they 
communicated to their hospitals. The only recom-
mendations in the ECDC protocol were to avoid Mondays 
in wards that admit more patients on Mondays, to collect 
data for one ward on a single day, and to collect data for 
all hospital wards within 3 weeks. The national point-
prevalence survey could be performed according to two 
methods for data collection: a patient-based protocol 
(referred to as the standard protocol) and a unit-based 
protocol (light protocol). In the standard protocol, 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed with the search terms “cross infection” 
[MeSH], “healthcare-associated infection$”, “nosocomial 
infection$”, and “hospital-acquired infection$”) in combination 
with “prevalence”, with age restriction (0–18 years) but without 
language or time restriction (up to June 30, 2016). Of 928 titles 
and abstracts, 15 reports were multicentre national or 
multinational prevalence surveys in high-income countries. 
One report was the pilot testing of the European Centre for 
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) point-prevalence survey 
in 2010. Two national surveys (Scotland and Poland) were part 
of the ECDC point-prevalence survey 2011–12 reported in this 
study. Most surveys were done in acute care adult or mixed 
adult and paediatric health-care settings. Only 
one multinational point-prevalence survey reported paediatric 
data. Between 1983 and 1987, WHO conducted a multinational 
prevalence survey in 47 hospitals of 14 high-income and 
upper-middle-income countries. Nine surveys were conducted 
in a general population in which children were included, two 
addressed neonatal intensive care only, and one was done in 
general paediatric wards. Finally, one study in the UK and 
Ireland focused exclusively on respiratory tract infections in 
children.
Added value of this study
This analysis of paediatric data from the ECDC point-
prevalence survey 2011–12 represents the largest 
multinational study on prevalence of health-care-associated 
infections in children. The adjusted prevalence of health-care-
associated infections was 4·2% (95% CI 3·7–4·8). The survey 
confi
 rms that the burden of infections is highest in infants 
younger than 12 months and in neonatal and paediatric 
intensive care units. Bloodstream infection was the most 
common type of health-care-associated infection, not only in 
neonates and infants in their fi
 rst 11 months of life but 
throughout most of childhood. With older age, infections 
such as lower respiratory tract infections or surgical-site 
infections were more common. The variation of prevalence 
among countries could not be explained by the distribution 
of paediatric settings, nor did it follow a geographical or 
socioeconomic pattern.
Implications of all the available evidence
Infection prevention and control should focus on the 
prevention of bloodstream infections in the youngest age 
groups, particularly in neonatal and paediatric intensive 
care units.

demographic and risk factor data were collected for every 
single patient. In the light protocol, denominator data 
were aggregated at the ward level and for each specialty 
(eg, total of paediatric surgical patients in the ward), and 
demographic and risk factor data were collected 
individually for each patient with at least one health-care-
associated infection. Data were collected by locally 
trained health-care workers and submitted to the national 
point-prevalence survey coordinators, who themselves 
submitted the data to ECDC. Additional information 
about the ECDC point-prevalence survey methodology is 
available in the ECDC report.3
Procedures
All children and adolescents (aged 0–18 years) were 
eligible for the ECDC point-prevalence survey if 
hospitalised in general paediatric wards, paediatric 
surgery wards, paediatric intensive care units (PICU), 
neonatal care units, or neonatal intensive care units 
(NICU), and admitted before 0800 h on the day of the 
survey. Those in day-care or long-term-care wards and 
healthy newborn babies in maternity wards were 
excluded. Data for patients and health-care-associated 
infections were retrieved from patient charts and other 
sources (eg, hospital information system, laboratory 
database) using standardised data collection forms.
We extracted data from the ECDC database for the type 
of infection according to the case defi
 nitions;4 the date of 
onset of the infection; the presence of invasive devices in 
the 48 h before onset of infection (for lower respiratory 
tract infections, urinary tract infections, and bloodstream 
infections); the microorganisms isolated; and selected 
antimicrobial resistance data. All data were collected by 
hospital point-prevalence survey staff
  on the day of the 
survey as part of the protocol.4
Defi
 nitions for health-care-associated infections were 
based on those from the German Krankenhaus Infektions 
Surveillance System (KISS) for neonatal infections5 and 
from the European Society for Clinical Microbiology and 
Infectious Diseases Study Group for Clostridium diffi
  cile 
(ESGCD).6 The defi
 nitions of health-care-associated 
infections used for paediatric patients are shown online 
(appendix).
Statistical analysis
Our main outcomes were the prevalence of health-care-
associated infections (defi
 ned as the proportion with one 
or more infections among all paediatric patients) and 
distribution of infection types in children and adolescents 
among countries and clinical settings. To calculate these 
outcomes, we combined data obtained with the standard 
and the light protocol. To calculate prevalence and

95% CIs we used two nested levels of clustering at the 
hospital level and country level to take into account the 
correlation of data within the levels.
Other outcomes were patient characteristics, exposure, 
and clinical settings, stratifi
 ed by cases (children with a 
health-care-associated infection) and controls (children 
without a health-care-associated infection). To calculate 
data for these outcomes we did a descriptive analysis on 
data obtained with the standard protocol. We compared 
categorical variables using the χ² test. We summarised 
continuous variables as means or medians and compared 
using the Student’s t test or the Wilcoxon’s rank-sum test 
where appropriate. 95% CI for proportions of patients are 
binomial exact CIs.
For our analysis of risk factors for health-care-
associated infections we used data obtained with the 
standard protocol. We used a generalised linear mixed-
eff
 ects model with a logit link function to adjust for risk 
factors. In the multivariable model, we adjusted for the 
following confounders: sex; age stratifi
 ed into fi
 ve groups 
(<1 month, 1–11 months, 1–4 years, 5–10 years, ≥11 years); 
McCabe score (non-fatal disease, ultimately fatal disease 
[ie, fatal outcome within the next 5 years], and rapidly 
fatal disease [ie, fatal outcome within the next 
6 months]);7 use of any invasive medical device (central 
catheter, 
peripheral 
line, 
urinary 
catheter, 
and 
ventilation) alone or combined; and length of hospital 
stay, defi
 ned as the days before and including the day of 
the point-prevalence survey for controls and as before 
and including the fi
 rst day of infection for children with 
health-care-associated infections and stratifi
 ed into 
four categories (<4 days, 4–7 days, 8–14 days, and 
>14 days). Patients with missing data were not included 
in this analysis. No consistent information was available 
about the size of the paediatric settings or whether 
hospitals were for children only. As a proxy we stratifi
 ed 
the analysis into four groups by number of children 
from that centre enrolled in the survey (≤25, 26–40, 
41–70, and >70 children).
Data reporting was done according to STROBE.8 Ethical 
approval was at the discretion of each national public 
health and government body in charge of each national 
point-prevalence survey (approval is not needed in all 
countries because point-prevalence surveys are part of 
national public health/health-care-associated infection 
surveillance plans). Anonymised patient and hospital level 
data were shared with the ECDC. Under EU legislation, 
patient consent for this surveillance study was not needed.
Role of the funding source
There was no specifi
 c funder for this analysis. The 
corresponding author had full access to all the data in the

submit for publication.
Results
Of the 231 459 patients included in the fi
 nal ECDC point-
prevalence survey database, 17 273 were children in 
29 countries. Children were hospitalised in 1356 wards in 
618 hospitals, of which 148 (24%) were primary hospitals, 
260 (42%) secondary hospitals, 146 (24%) tertiary 
hospitals, 39 (6%) specialised hospitals, and 25 (4%) of 
unknown status. Most children were hospitalised in 
general paediatric wards (n=8298; 48%), followed by 
neonatal units (n=4467; 26%), NICUs (2283; 13%), 
paediatric surgery wards (1437; 8%), and PICUs (788, 5%; 
fi
 gure 1). 16 237 (94%) children were registered on the 
study with use of the standard protocol, and 1036 (6%) 
with use of the light protocol. In the standard protocol 
population, most children were younger than 12 months 
of age (5587 [34%] younger than 1 month; 4024 [25%] 
aged 1–11 months). 2970 (18%) children were aged 
1–4 years, 1753 (11%) aged 5–10 years, and 1864 (12%) 
aged 11 years or older. Data for age were missing for 
39 (<1%) children.
In the unadjusted descriptive analysis (table 1), children 
with health-care-associated infections were of lower age, 
more likely to have a rapidly fatal McCabe score, had 
previous surgery, had any invasive device in place 48 h 
before infection or on the day of survey, had prolonged

length of stay up to the survey, and were more likely to be 
hospitalised in PICUs or NICUs (table 1).
770 health-care-associated infections were recorded in 
726 children, corresponding to a prevalence of 4·2% 
(95% CI 3·7–4·8). The range of prevalence in Europe 
was 1·2–10·4% (fi
 gure 1; appendix). Poland, Finland, and 
Cyprus had a prevalence above the upper limit of the 
95% CI for the total population (fi
 gure 1) and the Czech 
Republic and Italy had a prevalence below the lower limit 
of the 95% CI (fi
 gure 1).
PICUs (15·5%, 95% CI 11·6–20·3) and NICUs (10·7%, 
9·0–12·7) had the highest prevalence of health-care-
associated infections, followed by neonatology wards 
(3·5%, 2·8–4·5), paediatric surgery wards (3·4%, 
2·3–4·9), and general paediatric wards (1·8%, 1·4–2·4). 
These prevalence data were similar after we accounted for 
the number of children in these settings (appendix). 
Centres contributing more than 70 children to the database 
had a higher prevalence of health-care-associated infections 
(6·5%, 95% CI 6·1–6·8) compared with centres 
contributing 41–70 children (4·9%, 4·6–5·2), 26–40 
children (3·2%, 3·0–3·5), and 25 children or fewer (2·4%, 
2·2–2·5) to the database. Patients from centres 
contributing more children also had less favourable 
McCabe scores, more patients hospitalised in NICUs or 
PICUs, higher use of invasive medical devices, and 
enrolled children who were hospitalised longer (appendix).
Most health-care-associated infections (592 [77%] of 
770 infections) were identifi
 ed in infants younger than 
12 months. The prevalence of health-care-associated 
infections per age group was as follows: 5·1% (95% CI 
4·5–5·7) in children younger than 1 month; 6·5% 
(5·7–7·2) in those aged 1–11 months; 2·2% (1·6–2·7) in 
those aged 1–4 years; 2·1% (1·4–2·8) in those aged 
5–10 years; and 2·8% (2·0–3·5) in those aged 11 years or 
older.
Bloodstream infection was the most common type of 
health-care-associated 
infection 
(44·6%, 
95% 
CI 
41·0–48·1), followed by lower respiratory tract infections 
(22·2%, 19·3–25·2), gastrointestinal infections (8·3%, 
6·4–10·3), eye, ear, nose, and throat infections (7·1%, 
5·3–9·0), urinary tract infections (4·8%, 3·3–6·3), and 
surgical-site infections (4·4%, 3·0–5·9). The distribution 
of the types of infections diff
 ered by country and this could 
not be explained by the distribution of the diff
 erent 
paediatric settings (appendix). Bloodstream infection was 
the most common type of these infections in all age groups 
apart from for children aged 5–10 years, in whom lower 
respiratory tract infections were most common (fi
 gure 2). 
Urinary tract infections were uncommon in neonates, but 
contributed to up to a tenth of health-care-associated 
infections in older age groups. Surgical-site infections 
became more frequent in older age groups (fi
 gure 2).
Compared with neonates, children in older age groups, 
particularly after 11 months of age, were less likely to 
develop a health-care-associated infection (table 2). Both 
ultimately and rapidly fatal McCabe scores were 
signifi
 cantly associated with having at least one infection. 
Length of stay up to the day of the survey was a time-
dependent risk for health-care-associated infections 
(table 2). Having one or more invasive medical devices in

place was highly associated with having a health-care-
associated infection (table 2).
392 microorganisms were reported in 342 (44%) of the 
770 health-care-associated infections; 343 (88%) were 
bacteria, 28 (7%) fungi, and 21 (5%) viruses. 
Enterobacteriaceae were the most commonly isolated 
microorganisms (113 [15%]), followed by coagulase-
negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus (table 3). 
Coagulase-negative staphylococci were the most common 
microorganism in neonates and infants younger than 
12 months (table 3). 19% of S aureus isolates were 
resistant to meticillin. 44% of Enterobacteriaceae isolates 
were resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and 
9% were resistant to carbapenems (appendix). Of the few 
reported viruses, rotaviruses were the most frequently 
identifi
 ed (13 of 21 isolates); other viruses identifi
 ed were 
 
cytomegalovirus (three), HIV (one), herpes simplex virus 
(one), norovirus (one), respiratory syncytial virus (one), 
and without further specifi
 cation (one).
Discussion
Our results show that the burden of health-care-
associated infections in childhood is highest in the fi
 rst 
year of life and demonstrate the importance of 
bloodstream infections as the most common type of 
infections in children. Lower respiratory tract infections 
and surgical-site infections were more frequent in older 
age groups and the distribution of infections in children 
aged 5 years or older was close to the distribution of 
health-care-associated infections in adults.1,3,9,10 These 
fi
 ndings suggest that age-adapted strategies are needed 
for infection prevention and control in paediatric 
settings, with focus on the prevention of bloodstream 
infections. 
We observed variations in the prevalences and 
distribution of health-care-associated infections among 
European countries. These variations could not be 
explained by the distribution of paediatric settings in the 
database, nor did they follow a geographical pattern. 
Although the range of prevalence by country was wide, 
only a few countries were signifi
 cant high or low outliers 
(fi
 gure 1). No specifi
 c conclusion on the eff
 ectiveness of 
national infection prevention and control practices could 
be drawn from our results. Age as well as ultimately and 
rapidly fatal McCabe scores, length of stay, and invasive 
medical device use were independent risk factors for 
health-care-associated infections (table 2). As a proxy for 
the eff
 ects of the size of the participating settings and 
whether they were children’s hospitals, our analysis 
found that hospitals that had enrolled more children had 
a higher prevalence of health-care-associated infections.
The low prevalence in the age group younger than 
1 month was unexpected. A closer look revealed that this 
was due to the fact that, in the sample of paediatric 
settings that participated in the ECDC point-prevalence 
survey, (non-intensive) neonatal units contributed 66% 
of the neonatal population. Indeed, most neonates were 
hospitalised in regular non-intensive-care neonatology 
units. This observation is of interest because, in the 
published work, studies of preterm neonates in NICUs

are more common than those of infants in other neonatal 
units and thus, might contribute to a perceived high risk 
for health-care-associated infections in the neonatal 
population as a whole. However, some neonates with 
prolonged hospital stay were classifi
 ed in the age group 
of 1–11 months, and thus, contributed to the high 
prevalence in this age group.
Very few paediatric data have been reported from cross-
national point-prevalence surveys. Between 1983 and 1987, 
WHO held a multinational point-prevalence survey in 
47 hospitals from 14 countries (Australia, China, 
Czechoslovakia, 
Denmark, 
Egypt, 
Greece, 
Kuwait, 
Malaysia, Nepal, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, 
and UK).11 28 861 patients were included, of whom 
3147 (11%) were children. Prevalences of health-care-
associated infections in the four age groups of children 
(<1 month, 1–11 months, 1–4 years, and 5–14 years) were 
8·8%, 13·5%, 9·3%, and 6·7%, respectively. Since few data 
are provided from multinational studies, more information 
can be obtained from national point-prevalence surveys 
(table 4).9,12–25 One point-prevalence survey was the ECDC 
pilot survey in 2010.25 Eight national point-prevalence 
surveys were done in a general patient population in which 
children were included,9,12,14,16,18–22 two specifi
 cally addressed 
children in NICUs,17,23 and one was done in general 
paediatric wards.24 One study in the UK and Ireland focused 
exclusively on lower respiratory tract infections in children.15 
The largest paediatric dataset was from a national point-
prevalence survey conducted in France in 2001.19 In this 
survey, the prevalence of health-care-associated infections 
among children was 2·4% (95% CI 2·2–2·6%; table 4). The 
group of neonates also included newborn babies in 
maternity units, which might be the reason for the low 
prevalence of health-care-associated infections in this 
group (1·2%, 95% CI 1·0–1·5). Additionally, the proportion 
of laboratory-confi
 rmed health-care-associated infections 
(456 [81%] of 562) was unusually high, which raises 
concerns about the possible underestimation of infection 
prevalence, in particular lower respiratory tract infections 
and clinical sepsis.
As in our study, bloodstream infection was the most 
common type of health-care-associated infection in these 
reports (range 22·1–52·6% of infections).14,17,18,26 However, 
although the vast majority of bloodstream infections in our 
study were reported in infants younger than 12 months, 
the proportion of bloodstream infections remained high in 
other age groups. Lower respiratory tract infections and 
surgical-site infections were more frequent in children 
aged 5 years or older. Urinary tract infections were not 
common and overall were less important than other types, 
particularly in older age groups (fi
 gure 2).
Our results suggest that neonates and infants requiring 
intensive care are at high risk of health-care-associated 
infections. Other reports identifi
 ed risk factors for health-
care-associated infections similar to those identifi
 ed in 
our study—ie, young age and surgery,14 presence of an 
invasive device and prolonged length of stay,26 central 
venous catheter or mechanical ventilation,20 and young 
age and an ultimately or rapidly fatal McCabe score.18 In 
our study, all tested risk variables were independently 
and signifi
 cantly associated with health-care-associated 
infections, but the highest eff
 ects were found for the use 
of invasive medical devices and for length of stay of 
longer than 14 days up to the day of the survey or the fi
 rst 
day of infection (table 2)
The two most common groups of microorganisms 
among children in our study were Enterobacteriaceae and 
coagulase-negative staphylococci (table 3), which was

similar to fi
 ndings in France (Enterobacteriaceae 21·9%; 
coagulase-negative staphylococci 21·9%),19 Switzerland 
(50·0% and 29·2%, respectively),18 and the USA (25·6% 
and 31·6%, respectively).17 In a Mexican study, the most 
common pathogen in health-care-associated infections 
among children was Klebsiella pneumoniae (31·0%).27 The 
proportion of meticillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) in 
health-care-associated infections in children in the French 
point-prevalence survey was 26·7%.19 No MRSA was 
reported in paediatric patients in the Swiss study.18 The 
relatively low number of microbiologically documented 
health-care-associated infections was due to the high 
proportion of infection types that did not require 
microbiology testing, such as clinical sepsis or pneumonia.
Our study has some limitations. First, data for the 
ECDC survey were collected by many individuals in 
diff
 erent countries. Training was provided in all 
participating countries but data validation based on 
samples of suffi
  cient size was not possible due to 
resource limitations. Second, the results of this study 
might not be representative of the paediatric patient 
populations in acute care in all European countries. 
Future point-prevalence surveys should take into account 
representativeness of subgroups of paediatric patients. 
Third, conducting the survey at four diff
 erent time 
periods might have introduced bias in the case-mix of 
patients, particularly because they took place in diff
 erent 
seasons and over 2 years. However, these time periods 
were not in winter and summer seasons where paediatric 
settings are particularly prone to either low or high ward 
occupancy. Fourth, the data collection forms had limited 
fi
 elds for paediatric data. For example, more information 
about birthweight and prematurity would have been 
needed to adjust for relevant risk factors for health-care-
associated 
infections 
in 
neonates, 
and 
specifi
 c 
information was missing about the paediatric settings 
(eg, free standing children’s hospital, level of care, case-
mix). Fifth, only microbiology data available on the day of 
the point-prevalence survey were included and thus, both 
the distribution of microorganisms and antibiotic 
resistance data might not be representative for the 
sample. Although having incomplete microbiology data 
does not interfere directly with identifi
 cation of health-
care-associated infections, it might have consequences in 
subcategorising the type of infection. Sixth, healthy 
newborn infants might have been coded as belonging to 
a non-intensive neonatal unit, instead of being in 
gynaecology and obstetrics departments. We assume that 
the proportion of miscoded infants was low, but it could 
have aff
 ected data for the overall prevalence of health-
care-associated infections in neonatal wards. Seventh, 
calculating weighted EU and European Economic Area 
estimates as reported in the ECDC point-prevalence 
survey report for the overall survey3 was not possible 
because no specifi
 c information was available on the 
number of paediatric beds and patient-days in the 
countries.
Our analysis of paediatric data from the ECDC point-
prevalence survey 2011–12 represents the largest 
multinational study on the prevalence of health-care-
associated infections in children so far. Despite its 
limitations, our fi
 ndings provide detailed information on 
the prevalence and distribution of health-care-associated 
infections among hospitalised children in Europe. Our 
results show that the prevalence of health-care-associated 
infections in NICUs and PICUs in Europe remains 
unacceptably high. Bloodstream infections in neonates 
and children are associated with a high mortality and 
long-term adverse neurological outcomes.28 Prevention 
of health-care-associated infections in children in Europe 
requires 
a 
multinational 
quality 
improvement-
programme, with a focus on NICUs and PICUs and on 
health-care-associated bloodstream infections.
