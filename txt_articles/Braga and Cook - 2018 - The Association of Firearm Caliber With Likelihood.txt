The Association of Firearm Caliber With Likelihood of Death
From Gunshot Injury in Criminal Assaults
Anthony A. Braga, PhD; Philip J. Cook, PhD
Abstract
IMPORTANCE A foundational issue in firearms policy has been whether the type of weapon used in
an assault affects the likelihood of death.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the likelihood of death from gunshot wounds inflicted in criminal
assaults is associated with the power of the assailant’
s firearm as indicated by its caliber.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional study with multivariate analysis of data on
shooting cases extracted by the authors from police investigation files for assaults that took place in
Boston, Massachusetts, between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. These data were analyzed
between October 1, 2017, and February 18, 2018. In all cases the victim sustained 1 or more gunshot
wounds in circumstances that the Boston Police Department deemed criminal. The working sample
included all 221 gun homicides and a stratified random sample of 300 nonfatal cases drawn from the
1012 that occurred during the 5-year period. Seven nonfatal cases were omitted because they had
been misclassified.
EXPOSURES The primary source of variation was the caliber of the firearm used to shoot the victim.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Whether the victim died from the gunshot wound(s).
RESULTS The final sample of 511 gunshot victims and survivors (n = 220 fatal; n = 291 nonfatal) was
predominantly male (n = 470 [92.2%]), black (n = 413 [80.8%]) or Hispanic (n = 69 [13.5%]), and
young (mean [SD] age, 26.8 [9.4] years). Police investigations determined firearm caliber in 184
nonfatal cases (63.2%) and 183 fatal cases (83.2%). These 367 cases were divided into 3 groups by
caliber: small (.22, .25, and .32), medium (.38, .380, and 9 mm), or large (.357 magnum, .40, .44
magnum, .45, 10 mm, and 7.62 × 39 mm). Firearm caliber had no systematic association with the
number of wounds, the location of wounds, circumstances of the assault, or victim characteristics, as
demonstrated by χ2 tests of each cluster of variables and by a comprehensive multinomial logit
analysis. A logit analysis of the likelihood of death found that compared with small-caliber cases,
medium caliber had an odds ratio of 2.25 (95% CI, 1.37-3.70; P = .001) and large caliber had an odds
ratio of 4.54 (95% CI, 2.37-8.70; P < .001). Based on a simulation using the logit equation, replacing
the medium- and large-caliber guns with small-caliber guns would have reduced gun homicides
by 39.5%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Firearms caliber was associated with the likelihood of death from
gunshot wounds in criminal assault. Shootings with larger-caliber handguns were more deadly but
no more sustained or accurate than shootings with smaller-caliber handguns. This conclusion is of
direct relevance to the design of gun policy.

Key Points
Question Is there an association
between the likelihood of death for
firearms shooting victims and the caliber
of the firearm?
Findings A cross-sectional study using
5 years of data extracted from
investigation files kept by the Boston
Police Department determined that the
case-fatality rates of assaults inflicting
gunshot injury increased significantly
with the caliber of the firearm. Caliber
was not significantly correlated with
other observable characteristics of the
assault, including indicators of intent
and determination to kill.
Meaning The findings are foundational
to the debate over whether deadly
weapons should be better regulated and
provide evidence against the common
view that whether the victim lives or
dies is determined largely by the
assailant’
s intent and not the type
of weapon.

 Introduction
In 1 of 6 cases of criminal assault inflicting a gunshot wound, the victim dies.1 Whether any such
shooting proves fatal is determined by the number and location of wounds and by the size and
weight of the bullets, among other variables.2,3 Systematic studies of gunshot wound severity have
documented trends associated with the mix of firearms commonly used in assaults.4,5 Of particular
concern in the 1980s and early 1990s was the rapid shift from revolvers to semiautomatic pistols
and from smaller caliber to medium and larger caliber.6,7 The pistols were more powerful and enabled
the shooter to fire a large number of rounds rapidly, increasing the chance of multiple wounds.6-8
While speculative, recent studies suggest a continuing trend toward greater wound severity
associated with the greater power of firearms in common use.9,10 (Improved trauma care may have
prevented an increase in the national case-fatality rate.11) It is widely accepted among medical and
public health professionals that the likelihood of death in an assault increases with the power of the
gun.2,3,6-8,12 But that belief is routinely challenged by advocates and some social scientists in the
national debate over gun regulation.13,14
The opposing view holds that it is not the type of weapon that determines whether the victim
lives or dies, but rather the intent of the assailant.13-17 This notion is captured by the old slogan “
guns
don’
t kill people; people kill people.”In this view, an assailant who is determined to kill will do what
is necessary to accomplish that purpose, regardless of weapon type.11-19 As a logical corollary, the 1 in
6 who die from a gun assault differ from those who survive with respect to the shooter’
s intent and
determination. In effect, the criminal law and the courts conform with this view by treating a fatal
shooting as a more serious crime than a nonfatal shooting. The outcome of the shooting (life or
death) is viewed as a reliable guide to the intent—the determination to kill—of the shooter. The most
severe punishments, including the death penalty and life in prison, are reserved for cases in which
the victim dies.
In 1972, Franklin Zimring published a seminal article that challenged the belief that the outcome
of the shooting was primarily determined by the intent of the shooter.20 He found that nonfatal and
fatal shootings were very similar with respect to the circumstances and observed characteristics of
the victims and assailants. In effect, the survivors were “lucky”in that in many cases a small change in
the path of the bullet would have resulted in the victim’
s death. A notable pattern in Zimring’
s data
was that the likelihood of death was correlated with the caliber of the assailant’
s firearm. He
concluded that the outcome of gun assaults had a large random element, and that the power of the
firearm was one systematic factor influencing the likelihood that an individual with a gunshot injury
would survive, a phenomenon he dubbed “instrumentality.”The contrary view is that the caliber of
the gun is simply a reflection of the assailant’
s determination to kill, with little independent influence
on the probability of death.11-19
The importance of instrumentality in the gun debate is illustrated by findings from a recent
survey of experts by the RAND Corporation. Respondents were asked to estimate the effect on the
overall homicide rate of a policy that was successful in reducing the firearms homicide rate. Those
respondents who on other items had favored permissive firearms regulation tended to believe that
assailants would substitute other weapons with nearly the same effect, unlike those respondents
who favored more restrictive regulations: “Median responses by the permissive class suggested that
90 percent of prevented firearm homicides would end as a homicide by another means, and median
responses by the restrictive class estimated that just 20 percent would. The middle 50 percent of
responses from each group (ie, between the 25th and 75th percentile) did not overlap.”
21
The relative importance of chance vs intention in determining the likelihood of death cannot be
measured because there is no direct measure of intention in available data. But if Zimring is correct
that the caliber of the gun in an assault is not correlated with systematic factors such as the skill and
determination of the assailant, then the pattern of case-fatality rates across calibers provides a clean
test of instrumentality, akin to an experiment.

 This study follows the original Zimring analysis but with better data and more sophisticated
statistical techniques.
Methods
Official incident reports for 221 homicides and 1012 nonfatal gun assaults where victims and survivors
sustained gunshot wounds were accessed through the Boston Police Department (BPD). These
represent all cases known to the BPD for the period January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2014, that were
deemed to be criminal by the BPD (not justified or self-inflicted). The research team did not have the
resources to code all of the nonfatal cases, and instead selected a stratified random sample of 300
gunshot survivors by randomly selecting 60 survivors per year. Of the selected cases, 1 was excluded
because the event did not occur in the BPD’
s jurisdiction, and 6 were excluded because it was
determined that the individual had not been shot. One gun homicide and 2 nonfatal assaults were
committed with shotguns and excluded from the study because of the difficulty of comparing the
type of wounds generated by the multiple pellets of a shotgun blast with those created by bullets.
The final nonfatal shooting survivor sample included 291 individuals and the final fatal shooting
victim sample included 220 individuals.
The institutional review board at Northeastern University approved the study with the
requirement that gunshot victim and survivor identities were kept confidential by the removal of all
personal identifying information (informed consent from the participants was not required). The
study conforms with the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) reporting guideline for cross-sectional research studies.22
The research team attempted to acquire detailed information on the 511 fatal and nonfatal
shootings by interviewing investigators and reviewing incident reports and detective case files
(including emergency medical response and coroner reports). The case files for the homicide victims
were generally complete in recording number and location of wounds, but some of the files for
nonfatal cases were missing this information. Furthermore, some homicide and assault cases were
missing data on firearm caliber, either because cartridge and bullet fragments were not recovered, or
if recovered were too damaged to make a determination of the specific caliber. For analyses requiring
data on caliber, the working sample included 367 cases (184 nonfatal and 183 fatal). There were no
systematic differences between cases included in the analysis and those excluded because of
absence of caliber data (eTable 1 in the Supplement).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to compare the characteristics of fatal and nonfatal criminal
shootings with respect to the demographic characteristics of gunshot victims and survivors, the
circumstances of the assault, and other variables. Multivariate binary and multinomial logistic
regression models were used to estimate the relationship between a categorical outcome variable
and a predictor variable, holding the influence of other variables constant. The conventional 2-tailed
.05 level of significance was selected as the benchmark to reject the null hypothesis of no difference
in the association between variables. Missing data for caliber and wounds were analyzed using
multivariate logistic regression to ascertain if missingness was systematic or as good as random
(eTable 2 in the Supplement).
The primary analysis, which uses the working sample, had 3 goals. The first goal was to
determine whether caliber is statistically independent of observable characteristics of the assault,
including indicators of skill and intent, to validate the claim that caliber serves as a natural experiment
for testing instrumentality. We used χ2 tests to compare caliber with each cluster of variables
(demographic characteristics of the victim, circumstances of the assault, neighborhood in which the
assault occurred, whether it was indoors or outdoors, number of shots fired, and number and
location of wounds). In addition, a multinomial logit equation was estimated with all these covariates
included.

 The second goal was to use this natural experiment to estimate the causal relationship between
caliber of the assailant’
s firearm and likelihood that the victim died. The third goal, building on the
second, was to estimate the effect of a hypothetical intervention, namely replacing all the medium-
and large-caliber guns with small-caliber guns. Using the logit regression equation on outcome as the
basis for the simulation, the probability of death was calculated for each assault (and then averaged)
under both the observed calibers (small, medium, and large) and the hypothetical case of replacing
all larger calibers with small.23 The percentage reduction in fatalities (homicides) was a measure of
the overall effect of instrumentality associated with caliber for our sample.
It should be noted that the probabilities of death reflect the fact that the nonfatal shootings are
a sample of the total, whereas nearly all homicides are included. Hence the computed probabilities
are a multiple of the true probabilities of death. But the ratio of estimated probabilities should be
unaffected, as the multiple is the same for the numerator and denominator of the ratio.
In all analyses, caliber was coded as either small (.22, .25, and .32), medium (.38, .380, and 9
mm), or large (.357 magnum, .40, .44 magnum, .45, 10 mm, and 7.62 × 39 mm). The wound location
was coded as head or neck; chest, back, or abdomen; or arms and legs. The number of wounds was
coded as 1 or more than 1.
Stata SE 14.1 statistical software (StataCorp) was used to calculate the maximum likelihood
estimates of the parameters for the predictor variables and to compute the associated probability
values. In line with current best practice, robust standard errors were used, clustered by police
district. Policing districts were used as indicators for Boston neighborhoods to capture both
variations in community contexts and local policing practices that could affect the lethality of
shootings and the quality of investigative information.24,25
Results
Table 1 presents the characteristics of gunshot victims and survivors and circumstances in gun
assaults and homicides occurring in Boston between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2014. The
final sample of 511 gunshot victims and survivors (220 fatal and 291 nonfatal) was predominantly
male (n = 470 [92.2%]), black (n = 413 [80.8%]) or Hispanic (n = 69 [13.5%]), and young (mean [SD]
age, 26.8 [9.4] years). The fatal and nonfatal cases have very similar distributions across each
variable, including victim and survivor sex, race/ethnicity, age, and criminal history; circumstances
that led to the shooting; and police district. For only 1 variable is there a statistically significant
difference between fatal and nonfatal cases, and that is whether the shooting occurred indoors or
outdoors. Fatal shootings were more likely to occur indoors (54 of 220 [24.5%]) relative to nonfatal
shootings (39 of 291 [13.4%]), with a difference of 11.1 percentage points (95% CI, 4.2%-18.0%;
P = .001). Most gunshot victims and survivors were young minority men with prior court
arraignments. Most attacks occurred in circumstances where gangs or drugs played an important role
(according to BPD investigation results). Most were in outdoor locations in the disadvantaged Boston
neighborhoods of Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester.
Table 2 reports the distribution of calibers, shots fired, number of gunshot wounds, and wound
location for nonfatal and fatal cases. Police investigations determined firearm caliber in 184 nonfatal
cases (63.2%) and 183 fatal cases (83.2%). Most interpersonal gun violence involves handguns, and
Boston is no exception. Only 1 gun homicide was committed with a rifle caliber (7.62 × 39 mm fired
from an AK-47 assault rifle). The most common caliber was 9 mm in both nonfatal shootings (50 of
184 [27.2%]) and gun homicides (65 of 183 [35.6%]). Homicides were more likely to involve large-
caliber firearms (60 of 183 [32.8%]) relative to nonfatal shootings (33 of 184 [17.9%]).
The number of shots fired in each case was estimated by the BPD based on spent bullets and
cartridge casings recovered at the crime scene. The mean (SD) number of shots was higher in fatal
shootings (6.11 [5.73]) than in nonfatal shootings (4.41 [3.98]). Homicide victims were more likely to
have multiple gunshot wounds (119 of 183 [65.0%]) than were nonfatal shooting survivors (50 of
184 [27.2%]), and the mean (SD) number of gunshot wounds for homicide victims was

 correspondingly higher than the number for survivors (2.82 [2.76] vs 1.67 [1.41], respectively). A
separate calculation found that the number of shots fired was statistically unrelated to caliber for
both fatal and nonfatal cases (eTable 3 in the Supplement).
The distributions of wound locations differed in the expected way. For individuals with a single
wound, 84 of 134 (62.7%) were peripheral (legs, arms, or shoulders) for nonfatal cases, compared
with only 1 of 64 (1.6%) for fatal cases. For individuals with multiple wounds, the most serious wound
was peripheral in 18 of 50 nonfatal shootings (36.0%) compared with 1 of 119 fatal shootings (0.8%).
(The ranking used to determine seriousness was based only on location, with head and neck most
serious; then chest, back, and abdomen; then arms, shoulders, and legs.
Table 3 provides results relevant to the first goal of the analysis. It presents the results of a
multinomial logistic regression on the caliber of the gun used in the assault. In model 1, the variables
include the sex, race, and age of the victim or survivor, the circumstances (motivation) of the attack,
and whether the attack occurred indoors or outdoors. Model 2 adds additional covariates, including
the number of wounds and location of the most serious wounds (both considered indicators of skill

 and determination to kill). There are no statistically significant results for either model. Supplemental
χ2 analyses of association of caliber with victim or survivor and shooting characteristics also yielded
statistically nonsignificant results, confirming the results of the multivariate analysis (eTable 4 in the
Supplement). The lack of systematic association is what would be expected if caliber were assigned
at random, as in an experiment.
Table 4 presents the results of a multivariate logistic regression on whether the event was fatal
or nonfatal. The effects of caliber on odds of death are estimated, controlling for gunshot victim and
survivor characteristics, whether the shooting occurred indoors or outdoors, and neighborhood
indicators (included, not shown). Relative to shootings involving small-caliber firearms (reference
category), the odds of death if the gun was large caliber were 4.5 times higher (OR, 4.54; 95% CI,
2.37-8.70; P < .001) and, if medium caliber, 2.3 times higher (OR, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.37-3.70; P = .001).
The odds of death in indoor shootings were 2.6 times higher than in outdoor shootings (OR, 2.55;
95% CI, 1.79-3.64; P < .001). The effects of caliber size and indoor location remained strong in the
alternate specifications in models 2 and 3. None of the other covariates had a statistically discernible
effect on the odds of death.
The overall effect of larger caliber on deaths can be estimated by simulation using the logit
regression results in Table 4. The simulation uses the 367 shooting cases (184 nonfatal [63.2%] and

 183 fatal [83.2%]) with known caliber. First, the predicted probability of death for each shooting case
was computed using the actual caliber (mean [SD] probability, 0.499 [0.154]), and then the predicted
probability on the assumption that all shootings had been with a small-caliber gun (mean [SD]
probability, 0.302 [0.137]). The ratio of mean probabilities was 0.605. The implication is that if the
medium- and large-caliber guns had been replaced with small caliber (assuming everything else
unchanged), the result would have been a 39.5% reduction in gun homicides.
Discussion
In a pioneering article published in 1972, Franklin Zimring sought to demonstrate that the type of
weapon used in a criminal assault had a causal effect on the likelihood that the victim would die.20 He
compiled a data set that allowed him to compare the case fatality rates for criminal shootings by
caliber of weapon, which he asserted was a sort of “natural experiment.”He demonstrated that
fatality rate was positively correlated with caliber and argued that this gradient was a direct reflection
of the intrinsic power and lethality of the weapon. In this article we revisit his analysis with more
complete data and more sophisticated statistical methods. We were able to confirm the strong
positive association between caliber and fatality rate and summarize the overall effect of larger
calibers by simulating the effect on outcomes if all the guns had been small caliber. The result is a
39.5% reduction in the probability of death, implying an equal reduction in the gun homicide rate if
the same shootings had occurred but with small-caliber weapons, rather than the actual mix of small,
medium, and large calibers.

Association of Firearm Caliber With Death From Gunshot in Criminal Assaults

 That result suggests that the instrumentality effect is large even if the analysis is limited to gun
caliber. It would also be of interest to quantify the effect of replacing guns of all types with other
commonly available weapons. Presumably the effects would be still larger, although the precise
nature of the substitution would have to be specified.
Limitations
The main challenge to the results in the current analysis is the possibility that shooters who used
large-caliber guns, in comparison with those who used smaller-caliber guns, were somehow more
determined to kill or more skillful at killing in ways that are not well measured by the number and
location of wounds. That possibility is created by the fact that guns are not randomly assigned to
shooters. But we demonstrated that just as if there were random assignment, caliber was
uncorrelated with all observable aspects of the shootings except whether the wounded person lived
or died.
There are other limitations of this study. First, caliber was not available for all shootings. We
found no statistical pattern of missingness within each of the 2 categories of fatal and nonfatal, but
that does not completely settle the issue. Second, the study is limited to the criminal shootings
known to the police in a particular time and place.
Conclusions
Whether the type of weapon matters in affecting the outcome of a shooting is a foundational issue in
the debate over appropriate gun regulation. The results here support the view that the intrinsic
power and lethality of the weapon had a direct effect on the likelihood that a victim of a criminal
shooting died. For Boston, in the period studied here, simply replacing larger-caliber guns with small-
caliber guns with no change in location or number of wounds would have reduced the gun homicide
rate by 39.5%. It is plausible that larger reductions would be associated with replacing all types of
guns with knives or clubs.
The finding that the type of weapon is associated with fatality rate provides insight into the
nature of homicide. Whether the victim of a serious assault lives or dies is to a large extent a matter
of chance, rather than a question of the assailant’
s intent. The probability of death is connected to the
intrinsic power and lethality of the weapon. That suggests that effective regulation of firearms could

although insufficient in itself to demonstrate that any particular regulation would satisfy a cost-
benefit test.
