Introduction
Children comprise one of the largest consumer groups 
of technology.1 A recent study by the Massachusetts 
Aggression Reduction Center found that by fifth grade, 
40% of children have cell phones.2 Parents have reported 
that the purpose for a phone at this age is for security 
reasons or for keeping in touch with the family, but 
many parents gift their children a phone to keep in con-
tact with friends from school. A series of surveys distrib-
uted in 2011 and 2013 demonstrated a dramatic 5-fold 
increase in children’s access to mobile devices.3 The 
past 2 decades have introduced portable, individualized 
technology (cell phones and computers) to our society, 
increasing our reliance on these products for day-to-day 
tasks.4 It is difficult at the present time to predict whether 
this shift in technology use will have beneficial or harm-
ful influences on human health.
This question is particularly poignant in younger age 
groups, where the health implications of technology use 
are not well studied. The recent emergence of electronic 
and tablet-based children’s toys provides novel learning 
opportunities, but may also have unintended conse-
quences on motor development, activity, attention, and 
sleep. Some of these health implications may not mani-
fest until late adolescence or adulthood. Indeed, several 
studies have identified health repercussions associated 
with increased technology use in college-aged adoles-
cents,5 including decreased sleep quality, increased inat-
tention, and an increased body mass index (BMI).
Lack of sleep in adolescents has been associated with 
lack of productivity, depression, lack of energy, and 
poor school performance.6,7 A study by Olson and col-
leagues in 2014 explored whether nighttime cell phone 
use had an impact on sleep quality of adolescents 12 to 
20 years of age. The study found that 62% of patients 
took their phones to bed with them, 37% texted after 
“lights out,” and 1 out of 12 adolescents were woken 
 
by a text in the middle of the night at least 2 or more 
times each week.8 Taken together, these studies have

Abstract
Children comprise one of the largest consumer groups of technology. Sleep is fundamental to optimal functioning 
during childhood, including health and behavior. The purpose of this study was to explore bedtime electronic use 
and its impact on 3 health consequences—sleep quantity and quality, inattention, and body mass index. Parents 
of 234 children, ages 8 to 17 years, were surveyed to quantify hours of technology use (computer, video games, 
cell phone, and television), hours of sleep, and inattentive behaviors. Using any device at bedtime was associated 
with a statically significant increased use of multiple forms of technology at bedtime and use in the middle of the 
night, reducing sleep quantity and quality. Little association was found between technology use and inattention. 
A statistically significant association was found between bedtime technology use and elevated body mass index. 
Clinicians should discuss the impact of technology at bedtime to prevent harmful effects of overexposure.

established a foundation of declining sleep quality and 
quantity in adolescents that partake in texting at bedtime 
or even after “lights out.”
Hours of television time has been linked with poor 
sleep quantity and quality as well. A study of children ages 
4 to 11 found that increased screen time was associated 
with increased sleep anxiety, increased night waking, and 
increased total sleep disturbance.9 Studies of pediatric 
populations have also shown that watching evening televi-
sion resulted in significantly shorter total sleep duration.10
A systematic review of 36 research studies investi-
gating technology use in children proposed mechanisms 
by which electronic use before bed could cause sleep 
disturbance.11 The authors suggested that electronic use 
might displace sleep, since there is no fixed start or end 
time to electronic use. Second, media use before bed has 
been shown to increase physiological, emotional, or 
mental arousal. This has been established in video game 
and cell phone studies.12 Third, light emissions of 
screens from electronic media may be affecting sleep 
according to a study published by Cajochen et al.13
The impact of sleep quality/duration on child growth 
and well-being has been extensively studied. Sleep is 
fundamental to optimal functioning during childhood, 
including health, development, cognition, and behav-
ior.14,15 Numerous studies have established that poor 
sleep is associated with behavioral and emotional prob-
lems in childhood and adolescence.16-18 Poor sleep qual-
ity is highly prevalent in children with behavioral or 
emotional problems such as anxiety, depression, or 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Poor 
sleep quality, in turn, can also compromise mental and 
physical functioning.16 Solidifying a link between tech-
nology use at bedtime and poor sleep quality can serve 
as a point of intervention to correct sleep patterns and 
encourage effective childhood development.
Researchers have begun to investigate the potential 
relationship between increased technology use and 
ADHD. A study done by Christakis and colleagues 
found that early television exposure in children was 
associated with attentional problems by age 7 years.19 A 
study examining the association between cell phone use 
and inattention in middle school Chinese children found 
an association between inattention and time spent play-
ing cell phone games for more than 60 minutes per day.20
There have been numerous studies exploring the rela-
tionship between increased technology use and BMI. 
High-frequency cell phone users admit to bypassing phys-
ical fitness in order to use their cell phones and this behav-
ior is associated with decreased cardiorespiratory fitness.5 
The current recommendation by the US Department of 
Health is that children and adolescents (aged 6-17) partici-
pate in at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day.21 
Replacing time of activity with sedentary technology use 
is a means by which childhood obesity is becoming more 
prevalent worldwide. A study by Goldfield and colleagues 
examined the association between the duration of seden-
tary screen behavior and diabetes risk factors in adoles-
cents. When compared with video games and recreational 
computer use, they found that TV viewing was the only 
screen behavior that was associated with elevated hemo-
globin A1C, fasting insulin, and 2-hour post-glucose 
load.22 Another study by Hancox and Poulton found that 
BMI and prevalence of overweight children was associ-
ated with increased hours of television watched across all 
age groups.23 This expands the health consequences of 
increased television viewing to encompass not only declin-
ing sleep and inattention but also to increasing BMI and 
associated metabolic comorbidities.
Hypothesis and Specific Aims
Our study was designed to investigate the potential 
health impacts of increased technology use on children 
ages 8 to 17 with a particular emphasis on 3 variables—
BMI, sleep quantity and quality, and inattentive behav-
iors. We hypothesized that increased hours of tablet- and 
phone-based screen time at bedtime would be inversely 
correlated with sleep quality and child attention. We also 
hypothesized that these relationships would be accentu-
ated in overweight and obese children.
Methods
Data Collection
This study was approved by the institutional review 
board of the Penn State Hershey Medical Center on 
January 13, 2016. Informed consent was implied through 
voluntary completion of parent-child surveys. Surveys 
(Supplementary Figure 1, available online at http://jour-
nals.sagepub.com/home/cpj) were distributed to fami-
lies of children ages 8 to 17 years between March 2016 
and September 2016 at 2 clinic sites: the Penn State 
General Pediatrics Clinic and the Penn State Specialty 
Clinic for Childhood Obesity. Exclusion criteria 
included patients that fell outside the specified age range 
(8-17 years of age) as well as lack of parental pres-
ence—207 surveys were utilized. Surveys utilized 
parental report to assess 6 domains: child electronic use 
patterns, child sleep, child attention, child nutrition, 
child activity, and parental electronic use. Child elec-
tronic use was evaluated by (1) access to television, cell 
phone, video games, computers, tablets, or other devices 
at bedtime; (2) location of these devices relative to sleep 
space; (3) cell phone use during meals; and (4) hours per 
 Fuller et al 
3
day using television, phone, video games, and/or tablet/
computer. Child sleep patterns were characterized by (1) 
hours of sleep per night, (2) difficulty falling asleep, (3) 
difficulty maintaining sleep, and (4) morning fatigue. 
Child attention was assessed with 9 validated questions 
from the NICHQ Vanderbilt Assessment Form, mea-
sured on a 4-point Likert-type scale. Child nutrition was 
evaluated by consistent breakfast consumption. Parents 
also reported the average number of hours per day their 
child spent in (1) active play, (2) sport, and (3) recess 
and/or physical education. Parents also self-reported 
their average hours per day utilizing a television, cell 
phone, video game, or computer/tablet. A chart review 
was used to identify underlying medical conditions, cur-
rent ICD-10 ADHD diagnosis, and child anthropomet-
rics (BMI percentile) at the time of survey collection.
Children were stratified into 4 categories: normal 
BMI (<84.99%), overweight (85% to 94.99%), obese 
(95% to 98.99%), and severely obese (≥99%).
Statistical Analysis
Survey data was entered into REDCap electronic data 
capture tools hosted at Penn State Milton S. Hershey 
Medical Center and College of Medicine after establish-
ing an online form for confidentiality. REDCap is a secure 
online data capture designed for research studies that pro-
vides an interface for validated data entry and automated 
export procedures for data downloads to common statisti-
cal packages.24 BMI was categorized as a percentile as 
normal and then compared to overweight, obese, and 
severely obese BMI categories. BMI was then used as a 
variable outcome in logistic regression and compared 
with categories of electronic use before bedtime and sleep 
quality. From these comparisons, the P value was used as 
a measure of statistical significance using P < 0.05 as a 
cutoff. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval 
(CI) were used to determine the likelihood of association 
between variables and was considered significant if the 
95% confidence interval did not cross 1.0.
The one continuous independent variable was sleep 
hours. The mean sleep hours were calculated in pediatric 
patients and compared with the categories of outcome 
variables. A P value < 0.05 also indicated statistical sig-
nificance. A 2-sample t test was used to compare mean 
sleep hours with bedtime technology factors.
Inattention was defined by dividing the responses 
into 2 categories. The variable was dichotomized into 
“inattentive” with 6 or more responses in the “often” or 
“very often” category, or “not inattentive” with less than 
6 combined responses between the “often” and “very 
often” categories. Logistic regression was used for the 
dichotomous variable to compare with technology use.
To compare hours of child electronic use with paren-
tal electronic use, Bowker’s test was used to compare 
paired and correlated data.
Results
Child Electronic Use and BMI
A total of 234 surveys were collected. Surveys had to be 
excluded if we were unable to obtain their BMI, and 
were also excluded if the patient fell outside the desired 
age range. Of the remaining 207 surveys that were ana-
lyzed, there were 93 patients who fell into the “Normal 
BMI” category, 24 who were classified as “Overweight 
BMI,” 35 who were classified as “Obese BMI,” and 55 
who were classified as “Severely Obese BMI.” Within 
the “Normal BMI” category, the average age was 12 
years (±2.8). Within the “Overweight BMI” category, 
the average age was 13 years (±2.7). Within the “Obese 
BMI” category, the average age was 12 years (±2.8). 
Finally, within the “Severely Obese BMI” category, the 
average age was 12 years (±3.4).
Children who watch television at bedtime were more 
likely (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.35-4.18) to be overweight/
obese than children who do not watch television (Figure 1). 
Children who use their phones at bedtime were more likely 
to be overweight/obese than those who did not (OR = 2.3; 
95% CI = 1.31-4.05). There was no association between 
bedtime video game or computer use and an overweight/
obese BMI.
Child Sleep Quantity and Quality
There was a significant relationship between average 
hours of sleep and technology use before bedtime 
(Figure 2). Children who watched television at bedtime

statistically significant for an association with an overweight/

were recorded to get 30 minutes less of sleep than those 
who did not watch television at bedtime (P = 0.025). 
Children who used their phone at bedtime reported 
approximately 1 hour less of sleep than those who did 
not (P < 0.001). Also, children who played video games 
at bedtime reported 30 minutes less sleep than those 
who did not, and were more likely (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 
1.30-5.75) to have trouble staying asleep. Children who 
used a computer at bedtime were reported to have 
approximately 60 minutes less sleep than those who did 
not (P < 0.001) and were more likely (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 
= 1.10-3.92) to have trouble falling asleep.
There appeared to be an inverse relationship between 
sleep quality and amount of electronic use at bedtime. 
Children who used their phone at bedtime compared to 
those who did not were more likely (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 
1.45-4.42) to be tired in the morning (Figure 3) and were 
less likely (OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.14-0.51) to eat break-
fast in the morning (Figure 4). Children who played 
video games at bedtime were more likely (OR = 2.2; 
95% CI = 1.18-4.29) to be tired in the morning and were 
also less likely (OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.26-0.92) to eat 
breakfast in the morning. Finally, children who used a 
computer at bedtime were more likely (OR = 2.6; 95% 
CI = 1.35-4.87) to be tired in the morning and were less 
likely (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.19-0.66) to eat breakfast in 
the morning. These are all in contrast to children who 
reported watching television at bedtime but did not report 
excess morning fatigue (OR = 1.4; 95% CI = 0.82-2.38), 
although they were still less likely to eat breakfast in the 
morning (OR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.16-0.58).
Overweight and obese children were also more likely 
than children with a normal BMI to have difficulty 
falling asleep (OR = 2.3; 95% CI = 1.18-4.36) and were 
more likely to have trouble staying asleep (OR = 2.8; 
95% CI = 1.25-6.38). Overweight/obese children were 
also more likely to report morning fatigue (OR = 2.3; 
95% CI = 1.28-4.04) and were less likely to eat breakfast 
in the morning (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.19-0.72).
We also found that children who used one form of 
technology at bedtime were more likely to use more 
than one device (Figure 5). Texting in the middle of the 
night was more likely in children who watched TV at 
bedtime (OR = 5.2; 95% CI = 1.72-15.75), children who 
used their phone at bedtime (OR = 4.6; 95% CI = 1.73-
11.96), children who played video games at bedtime 
(OR = 4.8; 95% CI = 2.0-11.54), and those using a com-
puter at bedtime (OR = 3.6; 95% CI = 1.53-8.64).
Figure 2. Average hours of sleep with and without 
technology use at bedtime. All 4 technology use categories 
are statistically significant for at least a half-hour of lost sleep 
due to use before bedtime (television, P = .025; phone, P < 
.001; video games, P = .02; computer, P < .001). Error bars 
represent standard deviation for each category.

(OR = 2.6; 95% CI = 1.35-4.87) are statistically significant.

OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.26-0.92; television, OR = 0.3, 95%  
CI = 0.16-0.58).

Child Activity
Playing sports or playing outside more frequently put 
children at a decreased chance of being overweight/obese. 
Children who played sports up to 4 hours each day were 
less likely to have an overweight BMI (OR = 0.37; 95% 
CI = 0.21-0.67) and those who played sports for 4 hours 
or more were even less likely to have an overweight BMI 
(OR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.09-0.77). Children who played 
outside up to 4 hours each day were less likely to be over-
weight as well (OR = 0.46; 95% CI = 0.25-0.85) and 
those who played more than 4 hours a day were at a fur-
ther decreased risk (OR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.16-0.98). In 
these analyses, BMI was utilized as a dichotomous vari-
able rather than a continuous variable. Children with a 
greater BMI were more likely to be diagnosed with 
ADHD (OR = 2.7; 95% CI = 1.24-5.91). They were also 
more likely to be diagnosed with depression (OR = 4.9; 
95% CI = 1.38-17.36) and more likely to be diagnosed 
with asthma (OR = 2.5; 95% CI = 1.11-5.40).
Child Attention
Children that watched between 2 and 4 hours of televi-
sion were more likely to exhibit inattentive behaviors 
than those who watched only 0 to 1 hours of television 
(OR = 3.5; 95% CI = 1.50-8.32). In the current study, the 
number of hours of TV use was the only significant 
value for inattentive behaviors associated with technol-
ogy use.
Parental Electronic Use
There was no significant relationship between parental 
technology use and childhood technology use.
Discussion
Studies suggest that increased electronic use in children 
could have harmful impacts on development, but this 
precaution has not been followed by strong recommen-
dations for change. One suggestion made by Olson and 
colleagues includes placing the “charging station” for 
the phone or electronic away from the nightstand to dis-
courage use at bedtime.8 Because so much of our own 
society is becoming reliant on technology, it is difficult 
to shield children from its impact.
The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently 
released a new recommendation for advising families on 
media use.25 Their recommendation is that media is “just 
another environment” that children are exposed to, and 
it can have both positive and negative effects. They 
remind parents that parenting itself has not changed, and 
encourage parents not only to play with their children 
and be involved in their virtual reality but also to set 
boundaries on their hours of exposure as well. One rec-
ommendation that seems to parallel the findings of this 
study is to “create tech-free zones” by preserving family 
mealtime and recharging devices overnight outside the 
bedroom to promote healthier sleep. The findings of this 
study support the AAP’s recommendation: children 
exposed to television, cell phones, video games, and/or 
computers before bedtime have decreased sleep dura-
tion and quality and increased BMI. Creating this tech-
free zone could encourage healthier sleep patterns, 
which are crucial to childhood neurodevelopment. In a 
recent survey, 83% of participants stated that their pedi-
atrician has never talked to them about their child’s 
media use.3 Although the AAP does recommend treating 
this age of technology as simply another environment 
for the child, discussing technology use at bedtime may 
be a worthwhile conversation to have with patients.
Interestingly, in the Common Sense Media research 
study, one of the reasons parents give as to why their 
children have TV in their bedrooms is that it “helps the 
child fall asleep.”3 In contrast, the results of this study 
suggest that children who watch television before bed-
time sleep approximately 30 minutes less per night (P 
= 0.025). As far as we are aware that this study is the 
first in the literature to show that children and adoles-
cents who used either their phone or computer before 
bedtime get less sleep than those who watch TV (60 
minutes vs 30 minutes less sleep per evening; P < 
0.001). Further research is needed to assess screen time 
with these devices as it may be prudent for clinicians to 
ask about specific types of digital devices patients are 
using before bedtime and to counsel parents and 
patients about how specific digital devices can impact 
the quantity of sleep.
Figure 5. Likelihood for participants to text during the 
night with bedtime technology use expressed by odds 
ratios). All 4 technology use categories are statistically 
significant (computer, OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 1.53-8.64; video 
games, OR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.0-11.54; phone, OR = 4.6, 95% 
CI = 1.73-11.96; television, OR = 5.2, 95% CI = 1.72-15.75).

Global Pediatric Health
This study also shows a statistically significant asso-
ciation of cell phone (OR = 2.5), video game (OR = 2.2), 
and computer (OR = 2.6) use at bedtime and the likeli-
hood of participants to be tired in the morning. All 4 types 
of technology use at bedtime also significantly reduce the 
likelihood of eating breakfast (Figures 3 and 4).
This study found that children who used one form of 
technology at bedtime were more likely to use other 
forms of technology at bedtime as well. This is also in 
contrast to the results of the Common Sense survey, 
where parents reported that 60% of children never used 
more than one type of media at a time.3 Given the fact 
that digital devices become cheaper and more accessible 
to children and adolescents, more research is required to 
determine whether there is an exponential impact on 
sleep quantity and quality and other health parameters 
when using multiple devices before bedtime.
Another new finding that this study adds to the cur-
rent literature is the impact of sleep quality with chil-
dren’s and adolescent’s use of technology in the middle 
of the night. This study showed a statistically significant 
association: children who watch TV (OR = 5.2) or use a 
computer (OR = 3.6), phone (OR = 4.6), or video gam-
ing device (OR = 4.8) before bedtime were all more 
likely to text in the middle of the night compared with 
children and adolescents who did not watch a screen 
before bedtime. More research is required to determine 
how and when clinicians should counsel patients to 
improve sleep hygiene.
Two of the major health repercussions explored in 
this study—childhood obesity and sleep quality—are 
intertwined. A recent study by Kelly et al classified BMI 
trajectories across the first decade of development and 
found that 2 factors that were predictors of the moderate 
and high BMI groups were skipping breakfast and non-
regular bedtimes.26 They hypothesized that these dis-
rupted routines could influence weight due to an 
increased appetite and subsequent consumption of 
energy-dense foods. This idea was also explored in an 
article by Taheri et al, where they describe that short 
sleep duration produces increased ghrelin to stimulate 
hunger and cause increases in food intake and fat stor-
age. The short sleep duration also causes a decreased 
leptin level, which stimulates the appetite and leads to 
further weight gain.27 Therefore, it could be concluded 
that keeping to a more regular bedtime routine, particu-
larly one that does not include technology use, may help 
promote not only better sleep quality but may also help 
fight childhood obesity.
The fast pace of media and resulting overstimulation 
of children has been hypothesized to shorten children’s 
attention spans.28 Our survey did find that children who 
watched more than 2 hours of television each day were 
more likely to exhibit inattentive behaviors (OR = 3.5), 
but there was no other association with other forms of 
technology.
Our survey also found similar associations between 
obesity and other comorbidities that have been previ-
ously been described in prior research.16 Children with 
an increased BMI were more likely to be diagnosed with 
ADHD and were more likely to be diagnosed with anxi-
ety and/or depression. Kelly’s study tracking BMI 
development and psychosocial well-being in the United 
Kingdom found that “moderate” and “high” increasing 
BMI groups had worse scores for emotional symptoms, 
peer problems, happiness, body satisfaction, and self-
esteem.26 Bringing these results full-circle, a study done 
by Gregory and Sadeh demonstrated that poor sleep 
quality was highly prevalent in children with behavioral 
and emotional problems, which can then lead to anxiety 
and depression.17 Therefore, it is important to promote 
balanced technology use for the sake of a healthy weight 
and mental development for the child.
One of the limitations of our study is the inclusion of 
a reporting bias by the parents when filling out the sur-
veys. Since surveys are a self-reported data collection, 
our results from the study are subjective. For a more 
reliable association between technology use and inatten-
tion or sleep quality, we would strive to establish a study 
with objective data quantification. This could be done 
using sleep-monitoring technology to evaluate quality 
and duration of sleep, or use of the full NICHQ 
Vanderbilt Assessment Scale rather than the brief screen-
ing question set from the full system. In addition, ana-
lyzing the results with age as a continuous variable may 
yield a different result than grouping adolescents ages 8 
to 17 together. There also may have been a limitation by 
grouping hours of technology use into check-boxes 
rather than using this as a continuous variable. Finally, 
one confounding variable that could have skewed results 
of the study was obesity and its impacts on sleep. Obesity 
has been shown to be a risk factor for sleep disorders 
such as sleep apnea due to obstruction of the upper air-
way in sleep. This results in difficulty breathing and 
loud snoring at night, and decreased quantity and quality 
of sleep.29 It is therefore slightly more difficult to sepa-
rate out whether poor sleep quality is occurring as a 
result of increased technology use at bedtime and/or as a 
result of the increased BMI.
Something to consider in the future would be to 
extend the age range of the study. When designing the 
study, 8 years of age was selected since it was estimated 
to be around third-grade in elementary school. However, 
it was some of the youngest children that were using 
electronic toys in the waiting rooms of the clinic. Many 
toddlers and children under the age of 8 were given 
 Fuller et al 
7
parents’ cell phones or tablets with preloaded games on 
them to help entertain them while they waited in the 
doctor’s office. In the future, a more extensive study 
could include ages 8 and below, with the exception of 
infants or babies under the age of a year.
It is also important to point out that association does 
not equal causation. Although our study did find that 
children whose parents report increased technology use 
at bedtime generally had less hours of documented sleep 
and were more likely to be tired in the morning, we can-
not say that it was caused by their electronic use. Perhaps 
these children were having more difficulty falling asleep 
and may have turned to television or cell phone use to 
help them fall asleep. This is something that would need 
to be explored in a future study, as the scope of our sur-
vey did not allow for analyzing the motivation behind 
the technology use the bedtime.
This survey highlighted some of those very impacts 
and supported many previously discovered findings in 
the literature—namely, that technology use at bedtime is 
associated with not only decreased quantity of sleep but 
also with decreased quality of sleep and an increase in 
average BMI. A new finding of this study is that using 
any form of technology at bedtime increases the risk of 
a child using multiple forms of technology at bedtime 
and increases the use of technology in the middle of the 
night. Limiting technology use at bedtime is important 
for parents to keep in mind in order to encourage child-
hood development and promote mental health during the 
childhood and adolescent years. Based on the findings 
of this study, we recommend that pediatricians include 
the following topics in their discussions at well child 
visits: sleep quality and quantity, electronic habits, and 
physical activity and nutrition. Parents should be edu-
cated with regard to the possible associations between 
these factors in order to promote well-being of the child 
during the developmental years.
Conclusion
The results of this study solidify some well-established 
data concerning childhood obesity—namely that chil-
dren who watch more television are more likely to have 
an overweight or obese BMI.23 This study showed a sta-
tistically significant impact of television and/or cell 
phone use at bedtime is associated with elevated BMI in 
children and adolescents. The survey results highlight 
some associations between increased technology use 
and difficulty with sleep quantity in children and adoles-
cents. The data suggest that increased technology use at 
bedtime, namely, television, cell phones, video games, 
and computers, is associated with a decrease in the 
amount of sleep children are getting. These children 
were more likely to be tired in the morning and less 
likely to eat breakfast, which are risk factors for elevated 
BMI. The data also suggest that overweight and obese 
children and adolescents were more likely to have trou-
ble falling asleep and trouble staying asleep than their 
normal BMI counterparts. When children were reported 
by their parents to use one form of technology at bed-
time, they more than likely used another form of tech-
nology as well. For example, children watching 
television before bed were also more likely to be texting 
in the middle of the night than children who did not 
watch television before bedtime. In addition, children 
who watched more television were more likely to exhibit 
inattentive behaviors.
Altogether, the data suggest a connection between 
increased technology use at bedtime with decreased 
sleep quantity and quality. Along with all of the benefits 
of technology, however, come repercussions. It is impor-
tant to be aware of how this new age of technology may 
influence the coming generations so that we may be pre-
pared to offer recommendations as to prevent the harm-
ful effects of overexposure.
