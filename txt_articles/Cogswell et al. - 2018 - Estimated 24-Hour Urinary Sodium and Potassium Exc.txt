IMPORTANCE In 2010, the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academy of Medicine)
recommended collecting 24-hour urine to estimate US sodium intake because previous
studies indicated 90% of sodium consumed was excreted in urine.
OBJECTIVE To estimate mean population sodium intake and describe urinary potassium
excretion among US adults.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In a nationally representative cross-sectional survey of
the US noninstitutionalized population, 827 of 1103 (75%) randomly selected, nonpregnant
participants aged 20 to 69 years in the examination component of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) collected at least one 24-hour urine specimen in
2014. The overall survey response rate for the 24-hour urine collection was approximately
50% (75% [24-hour urine component response rate] × 66% [examination component
response rate]).
EXPOSURES 24-hour collection of urine.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mean 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion.
Weighted national estimates of demographic and health characteristics and mean
electrolyte excretion accounting for the complex survey design, selection probabilities,
and nonresponse.
RESULTS The study sample (n = 827) represented a population of whom 48.8% were men;
63.7% were non-Hispanic white, 15.8% Hispanic, 11.9% non-Hispanic black, and 5.6%
non-Hispanic Asian; 43.5% had hypertension (according to 2017 hypertension guidelines);
and 10.0% reported a diagnosis of diabetes. Overall mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion
was 3608 mg (95% CI, 3414-3803). The overall median was 3320 mg (interquartile range,
2308-4524). In secondary analyses by sex, mean sodium excretion was 4205 mg (95% CI,
3959-4452) in men (n = 421) and 3039 mg (95% CI, 2844-3234) in women (n = 406). By age
group, mean sodium excretion was 3699 mg (95% CI, 3449-3949) in adults aged 20 to 44
years (n = 432) and 3507 mg (95% CI, 3266-3748) in adults aged 45 to 69 years (n = 395).
Overall mean 24-hour urinary potassium excretion was 2155 mg (95% CI, 2030-2280); by
sex, 2399 mg (95% CI, 2253-2545) in men and 1922 mg (95% CI, 1757-2086) in women; and
by age, 1986 mg (95% CI, 1878-2094) in adults aged 20 to 44 years and 2343 mg (95% CI,
2151-2534) in adults aged 45 to 69 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In cross-sectional data from a 2014 sample of US adults,
estimated mean sodium intake was 3608 mg per day. The findings provide a benchmark for
future studies.

andomized clinical trials indicate reducing sodium in-
take can significantly lower blood pressure with greater
effects among adults with hypertension.1-3 In 2010,
the Institute of Medicine (IOM; now the National Academy of
Medicine), in its report on strategies to reduce sodium intake
in the United States, stated, “a more accurate measure of total
sodium intake such as 24-hour urine collection should be em-
ployed in national population surveys, specifically, NHANES
(the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey).”4
This recommendation was based on a review of studies that
suggested that 24-hour urinary excretion, when complete, re-
flects about 90% of sodium consumed from all sources.4,5
Historically, NHANES employed 24-hour recalls to estimate
sodium intake but dietary data typically exclude the amount
consumed from salt added at the table (estimated at 5% of
intake) and estimates can be affected by errors in self-report
or inaccurate estimates of the nutrient content of foods
consumed.6,7 Previous studies using 24-hour urine collec-
tion among adults living in the United States were based on
convenience samples or were not national in scope.8-13
Potassium intake is associated with blood pressure and is
inextricablylinkedwithsodiuminbiologyandphysiology,and
potassium chloride is used as a substitute for salt.4,5 Thus, con-
current estimation of 24-hour urinary potassium was effi-
cient even though the amount of potassium intake excreted
in 24-hour urine collection in previous studies was variable
(50% to 90%).5,10
The main objective of this study was to estimate mean so-
dium intake among US adults from 24-hour urinary excre-
tion. Secondary objectives were to provide estimates of mean
24-hour urinary potassium excretion and the sodium-to-
potassium molar ratio.
Methods
Data Source
Details about NHANES are available elsewhere, including the
protocol and data collection procedures.14,15 In brief, NHANES
2014 was 1 year of an ongoing, cross-sectional survey of the
US noninstitutionalized population, with household inter-
view, examination, and postexamination components. A na-
tionally representative sample was selected using a complex,
multistage design. Participants were enrolled and data col-
lected across all days of the week and seasons of the year. Data
are publicly released every 2 years. In 2013-2014, 66% of adults
aged 20 to 69 years screened for NHANES were examined.16
In 2014, half of these screened participants were randomly se-
lected and, if eligible (ie, nonpregnant), asked to participate
in 24-hour urine collection, postexamination.17 All partici-
pants provided written informed consent. This study was re-
viewed and approved by the research ethics review board for
the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC).
24-Hour Urine Collection
A detailed 24-hour urine collection protocol, based on previ-
ous population-based studies, was successfully piloted in
2013.18 In 2014, each participant selected and eligible for this
component was asked to collect a timed 24-hour urine speci-
men. Timed collections were started in the urine mobile
examination center and completed at the mobile center the
following day, with detailed verbal, written, and pictorial
instruction on collection provided to participants (Supple-
ment). Upon completion of the first 24-hour urine collection,
participants were eligible for a second 24-hour urine collec-
tion scheduled 3 to 10 days later. About half of the eligible
participants were selected and asked to collect a second
24-hour urine specimen (details in the Supplement). A com-
plete 24-hour urine collection was defined as (1) recorded
start and stop times; (2) 22 hours or more duration (from start
to stop of collection); (3) total urine volume of 400 mL or
more; (4) reported no more than a few drops of urine lost
during collection; and (5) for women, no reported menstrua-
tion during collection. Details on urine specimen processing,
storage, shipping, quality assurance, and control procedures
are available elsewhere.17,19,20 To protect the confidentiality
of survey respondents, the data from the 2014 24-hour urine
collection were accessed and analyzed in the National Center
for Health Statistics Research Data Center.21
Urinary Electrolyte and Creatinine Excretion
Urine specimens were analyzed for electrolytes (ie, sodium,
potassium, chloride) using the ion-selective electrode tech-
nique (Mod PE analyzer; Roche)19 and for creatinine using the
enzymatic assay (Cobas 6000 Analyzer; Roche).20 The uri-
nary sodium and potassium measurements showed low ana-
lytical imprecision (<3% coefficient of variation for 2 quality
control pools analyzed over a period of 14 months) and satis-
factory agreement with the National Institute of Standards and
Technology standard reference materials: 2201 mg for so-
dium chloride (mean bias for sodium of 3.4% [SD, 3.8%] over
a concentration range of 25-200 mEq/L) and 2202 mg for po-
tassium chloride (mean bias for potassium of 1.6% [SD, 3.9%]
over a concentration range of 12-100 mEq/L). The total amount
of the analyte (eg, electrolyte, excreted in each 24-hour urine
specimen) was standardized to 24 hours by multiplying the
analyte concentration by the adjusted 24-hour urine volume
basedondurationofcollection(hoursfromstarttostop).21Data
from 2 convenience samples of US adults indicate the within-
individual (day-to-day) coefficient of variation in 24-hour uri-
nary sodium excretion was 19% to 23% for adults aged 18 to
39 years11 and 31% to 38% for adults aged 45 to 79 years.12
Key Points
Question How much dietary sodium do US adults consume?
Findings In this nationally representative survey of 827 US adults
aged 20 to 69 years, mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion
was 3608 mg overall, and was significantly higher among men
(4205 mg) than women (3039 mg). Mean 24-hour urinary
potassium excretion was 2155 mg overall.
Meaning These findings may provide a benchmark for
future studies.

 Analyses by Participant Subgroups
In secondary analyses, data on urinary electrolyte excretions
were analyzed by sex and age group (20-44 years and 45-69
years). Additional exploratory analyses were conducted on
24-hour urinary sodium excretion by 10-year age groups and
on24-hourelectrolyteexcretionbyotherdemographicandcar-
diovascular disease (CVD) risk subgroups based on nonmiss-
ing values for the specified participant characteristic. Previ-
ous studies indicate urinary excretion of electrolytes can vary
by sex, age, and race or ethnic origin.8-13 Demographic char-
acteristics (subgroups) for exploratory analyses included race
or Hispanic origin (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
non-Hispanic Asian, and Hispanic); education (≤12 years or
General Educational Development certificate, >12 years); and
family income as a percentage of poverty guidelines (≤130%,
>130%). Demographic characteristics were based on partici-
pant, self-reported information.15 Participants reported their
sex, race, ethnic origin, and education level using standard-
ized categories, including options for “other,” “do not know,”
orrefusal.Participantswhoreported“other”non-Hispanicrace
or more than 1 race were included in total population esti-
mates, but excluded from subpopulation analyses by race and
Hispanic origin due to small sample size. Age and family in-
come were reported in years and dollar amounts, respec-
tively, then categorized into analytic subgroups.
CVD risk subgroups included weight status subgroups
based on body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared); physical activity
level based on standard questions; reported action to reduce
sodiumorsaltintake;hypertensionstatusbasedonbloodpres-
sure measurements and use of antihypertensive medication;
diagnosed diabetes (self-reported diagnosis by a clinician
or use of a diabetes medication); chronic kidney disease
(estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or
urinary albumin/creatinine ratio >30 mg/g),22,23 and self-
reportedhistoryofCVD(congestiveheartfailure,coronaryheart
disease, angina or angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, or
stroke). Reported action to reduce sodium or salt intake was
determined by an affirmative response to 1 part of a multipart
question,“Toloweryourriskforcertaindiseases,areyounow
doing any of the following:…?” One of “the following” items
was “reducing the amount of sodium or salt in your diet?”15
Mean blood pressure was calculated from 2 or 3, consecutive,
brachialbloodpressurereadings.Beforemeasurement,maxi-
mum inflation level was determined and participants rested
quietly in a seated position for 5 minutes. A calibrated mer-
curysphygmomanometerwiththecuffappropriateforthepar-
ticipant’
s arm circumference was used by a trained techni-
cian. Hypertension status was defined based on the 2017
hypertension guidelines24 and based on the previous
definition25 in a sensitivity analysis. Detailed descriptions of
BMI, physical activity level, and hypertension status assess-
ment and definitions are available in the Supplement.
Dietary Sodium and Energy Intake
Sodium and energy intake for nonpregnant adults aged 20 to
69 years for this study was based on the initial dietary recall
in NHANES 2013-2014. The initial 24-hour dietary recall was
collected in-person by trained interviewers using the United
States Department of Agriculture (USDA) automated multiple-
pass method with food models.26 The nutrient values for each
reported food were assigned using the USDA Food and Nutri-
ent Database for Dietary Studies.27 Dietary sodium intake cal-
culations excluded salt added at the table as the amount of salt
added was not quantified.
Statistical Analysis
The target sample size in the 24-hour urine collection compo-
nent in 2014 was based on the minimum number per sociode-
mographic subgroup (n = 100-160 participants) required to es-
timateaprevalenceof90%,andforsurveydesigneffectsof1.25
to 2.00.28 A minimum effective sample size of 38 to 60 partici-
pants per group was recommended for estimating a mean with
a survey design effect of 1.25 to 2.00, respectively.28
Analyses were conducted to compare the weighted distri-
butions of population characteristics represented by nonpreg-
nant NHANES 2013-2014 examination participants aged 20 to
69 years (n = 4656) among participants who completed a
24-hoururinecollectionin2014andamongthosewhodidnot.
Additional analyses were conducted to describe the distribu-
tions of population characteristics represented by partici-
pants who completed 24-hour urine collection in 2014, among
men and women, further weighted for selection and nonre-
sponse to this component.
The initial 24-hour urine collection was used to estimate,
among a group of US adults, 24-hour urinary sodium and po-
tassium excretion and their molar ratio. A single 24-hour urine
collection is an indicator of short-term sodium intake and can
vary from day to day within individuals with foods con-
sumed, as well as with biological factors and rhythms inde-
pendent of intake.29,30 Given a sufficient number of partici-
pants, within-individual day-to-day variability does not affect
estimates of population means.6 Individuals with “usual” high
or low levels of intake or excretion, however, can have even
higher or lower levels based on a single 24-hour urinary ex-
cretion, which can increase the variance around a population
mean.6,29 The interquartile range and proportion with intake
above a specific threshold reflect the distribution of acute in-
take or excretion on any given day.
In this study, the weighted means (95% CIs) and percen-
tiles of 24-hour urinary electrolyte excretions were esti-
mated, and, for sodium, the weighted proportion of the popu-
lation with 24-hour urinary excretion greater than or equal to
2300 mg (the sodium tolerable upper intake level according
to the 2005 IOM panel on dietary reference intakes for elec-
trolytes and water).5 Analyses of weighted urinary electro-
lyte excretion among population subgroups were conducted
based on nonmissing values for the specified demographic or
health characteristic.
Four sensitivity analyses were conducted. First, urinary
sodium and potassium excretion and 95% CIs were esti-
mated after excluding additional participants with poten-
tially incomplete collection based on observed-to-expected
24-hour urinary creatinine levels (Supplement).31,32 Second,
multiple imputation was used to classify participants
into subgroups who had missing values for demographic

 characteristics or CVD risk factors (Supplement).33 Mean
sodium and potassium excretion were then estimated for
population subgroups based on imputed values. Third,
weighted mean 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium
excretion and their molar ratio were examined by hyperten-
sion status using the previous, higher, thresholds for blood
pressure, now called stage 2 hypertension (for definition, see
the Supplement).25 Fourth, mean population dietary intake
of sodium, energy, and sodium density were described using
data from 4246 nonpregnant adults aged 20 to 69 years who
participated in NHANES 2013-2014 and had a reliable initial
dietary recall.
Estimated distributions of population characteristics, uri-
naryelectrolytes,anddietarydatawerebasedonweighteddata

acteristicsestimatedwithnonpregnantparticipantsinNHANES
2013-2014bycompletionof24-hoururinecollection,the2013-
2014 examination sample weights were used. For estimates of
sodium and energy intake based on NHANES 2013-2014 di-
etary recall data, the initial day dietary sample weights were
used. For the distribution of characteristics and urinary elec-
trolyte excretion estimated using data from those who com-
pleted 24-hour urine collection, the 24-hour urine sample
weights were used to account for additional sampling and non-
response. Rao-Scott F-adjusted χ2 statistics were used for com-
paring proportions, and t tests for comparing means. Statisti-
cal testing and 95% CI accounted for the complex survey
sample design.
In addition, unweighted analyses were conducted. These
analyses included completion rates for 24-hour urine collec-
tion; within-individual variability and differences in urinary
electrolyte and creatinine excretion; and unweighted means,
standard deviation, and percentiles of 24-hour urinary so-
dium and potassium excretion. Among the subset of partici-
pants with two 24-hour urine specimens, within-individual to
between-individual variability in urinary electrolyte and cre-
atinine excretion was estimated using methods described
previously.34 χ2 Tests were used for comparing unweighted
24-hour completion rates by participant characteristics.
All analyses were conducted with SAS (SAS Institute),
version 9.3, and SAS-callable SUDAAN (RTI International),
version 11.0. A 2-sided P value of less than .05 was consid-
ered statistically significant for all statistical comparisons
between groups. No adjustments were made for multiple
comparisons. Estimates with a relative standard error (stan-
dard error/estimate [mean or proportion]) more than 30%
were deemed statistically unreliable and not reported.28

 BMI less than 25.0 (68.8%) (eTable 2 in the Supplement). The
overall survey response rate for the 24-hour urine collection
was estimated at approximately 50% (75% [24-hour urine
completionrate] × 66%[NHANESexaminationresponserate]).
Estimated Population Demographic
and Health Characteristics
Among the nonpregnant adults aged 20 to 69 years who par-
ticipated in the examination component of NHANES 2013-
2014 (n = 4656), distributions of population demographic
characteristics and cardiovascular disease risk factors were
not statistically significantly different among participants
who completed 24-hour urine collection in 2014 vs those
who did not (Table 1). Those who completed the 24-hour
urine collection, represented a population of US adults of
whom 52.5% (95% CI, 48.3%-56.8%) were men compared
with 48.9% (95% CI, 57.0%-50.7%) men based on those who
did not complete a 24-hour urine collection, P = .14. The per-
centages for race and Hispanic origin distributions were
65.4% (95% CI, 55.3%-75.4%) non-Hispanic white, 15.2%
(95% CI, 7.4%-23.1%) non-Hispanic black, 10.9% (95% CI,
7.7%-14.1%) Hispanic, and 5.5% (95% CI, 2.5%-8.6%) non-
Hispanic Asian, based on those who completed a 24-hour
urine collection. The percentages based on those who did not
complete a 24-hour urine collection were 63.5% (95% CI,
54.9%-72.1%) among non-Hispanic white, 11.0% (95% CI,
7.7%-14.2%) non-Hispanic black, 17.2% (95% CI, 10.7%-
23.7%) Hispanic, and 5.5% (95% CI, 4.1%-6.9%) non-Hispanic
Asian participants, P = .18. In addition, the percentages of
adults who had more than 12 years of education were 60.2%
(95% CI, 54.0%-66.5%) based on those who completed a
24-hour urine collection and 64.4% (95% CI, 59.3%-69.4%)
based on those who did not, P = .18; and 44.9% (95% CI,
39.7%-48.8%) of adults who completed a 24-hour urine col-
lection were estimated to have hypertension based on 2017
guidelines vs 40.1% (95% CI, 38.5%-41.8%) for those who did
not, P = .08.
With further weighting of the 24-hour urine sample in
2014 for selection and nonresponse (Table 2), the study
sample represented a population of whom 48.8% (95% CI,
44.8%-52.9%) were men; 63.7% (95% CI, 51.6%-75.8%) were
non-Hispanic white, 15.8% (95% CI, 10.0%-21.6%) were
Hispanic, 11.9% (95% CI, 5.1%-18.7%) were non-Hispanic
black, and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.3%-8.9%) were non-Hispanic
Asian, 43.5% (95% CI, 37.4%-49.7%) had hypertension, and
10.0% (95% CI, 6.9%-13.0%) reported diabetes diagnosis. The
number of participants with missing values on demographic
characteristics or CVD risk factors varied from 0 (sex, age,
race and ethnic origin, physical activity, reported reducing
sodium or salt intake) to 50 participants (family income). A
higher percentage of men (47.6% [95% CI, 39.8%-55.4%])
than women (39.7% [95% CI, 33.2%-46.1%]) were estimated
to have hypertension, P = .03.
Second 24-Hour Urine Collection
Of 585 participants who were selected, 436 (75%; men, 255;
women, 211) completed a second 24-hour urine collection
(eTable 1 in the Supplement; Figure), 53% of the 827 partici-
pants who completed the first collection. Population charac-
teristics, mean initial 24-hour urine volume, and mean uri-
nary electrolyte and creatinine excretion did not vary
significantly when estimated based on participants who col-
lected 1 vs 2 complete 24-hour urine specimens (eTable 3 in the
Supplement).Amongparticipantswithtwo24-hoururinespeci-
mens,theratioofwithin-individualtobetween-individualvari-
ability in sodium excretion was 1.08 overall, 0.76 among men,
and 1.99 among women (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Within-
individual to between-individual variability was similarly high
forchloride(0.88to1.67),somewhatlowerforpotassium(0.50
to 0.66), and lowest for creatinine (0.37 to 0.40). The mean
within-individual difference in 24-hour urinary sodium excre-
tion was −47 mg (SD, 1739), and the interquartile range (IQR)
was −1020 to 950. The standard deviation of within-
individual differences were similar for men (1734 mg) and
women (1745 mg) (eTable 5 in the Supplement).
24-Hour Urinary Sodium Excretion
Weighted mean 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was 3608
mg(95%CI,3414-3803),n = 827(Table3).Themedian24-hour
urinary sodium excretion was 3320 mg (IQR, 2308-4524). In
secondary analyses by sex, mean 24-hour urinary sodium ex-
cretion was 4205 mg (95% CI, 3959-4452) in men and 3039 mg
(95% CI, 2844-3234) in women, between-group P < .001
(Table 3; eTable 6 in the Supplement). By age group, mean so-
dium excretion was 3699 mg (95% CI, 3449-3949) in adults
aged 20 to 44 years (n = 432), and 3507 mg (95% CI, 3266-
3748) in adults aged 45 to 69 years (n = 395), P = .20 (Table 3;
eTable 6 in the Supplement).
In exploratory analyses, mean 24-hour urinary sodium ex-
cretion appeared to be generally higher for adults aged 20 to
59 years compared with adults aged 60 to 69 years (eFigures
1 and 2 in the Supplement). Mean 24-hour urinary sodium ex-
cretion also appeared to vary significantly by BMI, hyperten-
sion status, and diabetes status groups (Table 3; eTable 6 in the
Supplement). Unweighted means and percentiles were simi-
lar to weighted values (Table 3, eTable 7 in the Supplement).
The proportion of adults with 24-hour urinary sodium ex-
cretion greater than or equal to 2300 mg on any given day was
75.1% (95% CI, 72.0%-78.2%) overall (n = 827), 83.5% (95% CI,
79.9%-87.0%) in men (n = 421), and 67.1% (95% CI, 62.1%-
72.0%) in women (n = 406) (eTable 8 in the Supplement).
24-Hour Urinary Potassium Excretion
and the Sodium-to-Potassium Molar Ratio
Weighted overall mean 24-hour urinary potassium excretion
was 2155 mg (95% CI, 2030-2280) (Table 4). The median was
2000 mg (IQR, 1392-2756). In secondary analyses, mean
24-hour urinary potassium excretion was 2399 mg (95% CI,
2253-2545) among men, and 1922 mg (95% CI, 1757-2086)
among women, P < .001 (Table 4; eTable 9 in the Supple-
ment). In addition, mean 24-hour urinary potassium excre-
tion was lower among adults aged 45 to 69 years vs adults aged
20 to 44 years (Table 4; eTable 9 in the Supplement).
In exploratory analyses, mean 24-hour urinary potas-
sium excretion varied significantly between groups defined by
race and Hispanic origin, income, education, and BMI (in men)

 With and without multiple imputation for missing
values, population estimates for mean urinary electrolyte
excretion were similar (eg, mean 24-hour urinary sodium
excretion: 3506 mg [95% CI, 3223-3789] with multiple impu-
tation and 3527 mg [95% CI, 3250-3820] without multiple

nary sodium excretion was higher among hypertensive vs nor-
motensive men and potassium excretion was higher among

dietary sodium intake was higher in men (4175 mg [95% CI,
4061-4290]) than women (3044 [95% CI, 2994-3094]),
P < .001. Mean sodium density in men (1696 mg/1000 kcal
[95% CI, 1668-1723]) was similar to that for women (1703 [95%
CI, 1653-1754]), P = .78.
Discussion
In a 2014 cross-sectional sample of US adults aged 20 to 69
years, mean sodium intake was estimated based on 24-hour
urinary sodium excretion. Given studies indicating about 90%
of sodium consumed was excreted in urine,5,30 mean intake
may be about 4000 mg per day (ie, 3608 mg/0.90 = 4008 mg).
Mean 24-hour urinary potassium excretion was 46% of the
2005 IOM adequate intake level of 4700 mg daily and less
than 3510 mg per day, the minimum level suggested in 2012
by the World Health Organization to reduce blood pressure
and risk of cardiovascular diseases.5,35 However, the frac-
tion of potassium intake excreted in urine is known to be
highly variable, and may be as little as half the amount
consumed.5,10 In addition, organizations and individuals
disagree on recommended and upper levels for dietary
sodium and potassium.5,24,35,36 The recommended intake
and upper levels for dietary sodium and potassium are cur-
rently under review by the National Academies.5,37
Mean sodium intake and potassium excretion estimates
among US adults in 2014, overall and among demographic
and CVD risk groups, were generally within the range of
previous estimates based on 24-hour urine collection in
convenience-based or population-based samples represent-
ing smaller geographic areas of the US collected in 2011 or
earlier.8-13 Mean 24-hour urinary sodium-to-potassium molar
ratio in this study was within the range of estimates (2.77 to
4.78) from US locations in the 1984-1987 International Study
of Sodium, Potassium, and Blood Pressure (INTERSALT)
study.38 Mean sodium intake estimates from 24-hour urine
specimens in 2014 also were generally comparable with
intake estimates based on NHANES 2013-2014 dietary data
for nonpregnant adults aged 20 to 69 years.
Based on both dietary data and previous biomarker
(24-hour urinary excretion and doubly labeled water) data in
other samples of US adults,8,9 higher sodium intake in men
was likely related to higher energy intake, rather than a more
sodium-dense diet (ie, higher consumption of sodium per
calorie). The lack of a significant difference in 24-hour uri-
nary sodium excretion by broad age groups may be related to
small sample size or to the exclusion of older adults. Consis-
tent with a previous study,13 24-hour urinary sodium excre-
tion in the current study was not significantly lower by age
except among the oldest age group.
Differences and similarities in exploratory analyses of
mean 24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion
among adults with different demographic characteristics,
CVD risks, or self-reported efforts to reduce sodium or salt
intake may be related to several factors. These factors
include, the lack of temporality due to the cross-sectional
survey design, small sample sizes across subgroups, presence
of confounding (eg, by weight status or older age), differ-
ences in electrolyte retention or excretion, or ineffective indi-
vidual efforts to reduce dietary sodium or salt intake. A com-
panion cross-sectional analysis with NHANES 2014 24-hour
urine data indicated higher sodium and lower urinary potas-
sium excretion were positively associated with blood pres-
sure in a dose-response relationship after adjusting for demo-
graphic characteristics and CVD risk factors.39
This study has several strengths: (1) use of a nationally
representative sample; (2) in-person start and stop of 24-hour
urine collection for most participants (n = 782) to try to
ensure accurate timing; (3) collection of 24-hour urine across
weekdays and weekends as well as all seasons of the year;
and (4) collection of a second, nonconsecutive, 24-hour urine
specimen by 53% of participants to estimate within-
individual, day-to-day variability in 24-hour urinary electro-
lyte excretion.
Limitations
This study also has several limitations. Although electrolyte
estimates were weighted to account for sampling and nonre-
sponse, it was not possible to account for all potential sources
of bias. Second, although the national estimates from the
24-hour urine study participants were generally similar to
that of the entire sample of examined nonpregnant partici-
pants aged 20 to 69 years in the NHANES 2013-2014 cycle,
nonresponse and small sample sizes could limit the general-
izability of results particularly among subgroups with low
response rates (eg, non-Hispanic Asians). In addition, a plau-
sible reason for the lack of significant differences in mean
24-hour urinary sodium and potassium excretion between
population subgroups was inadequate statistical power due
to small sample size. Third, incomplete collection of 24-hour
urine might have resulted in lower estimated sodium and
potassium excretion. However, detailed verbal, pictorial, and
written collection instructions, along with exclusion of par-
ticipants with potentially incomplete urine collection, helped

 ensure complete collection, and sensitivity analyses to
exclude potential incomplete collection did not meaningfully
change results. Fourth, within-individual variability in
24-hour urinary sodium excretion was almost as great as or
greater than between-individual variability, consistent with
previous studies.11,12,34 Thus, a single 24-hour urine collec-
tion may not represent an individual’
s usual long-term daily
sodium intake. The population estimates of the mean and
medians should not be affected by random within-individual
variability, but the proportion of adults in the population
with usual sodium intake of 2300 mg or more may be under-
estimated based on a single 24-hour urine. Fifth, unac-
counted variability in potassium excretion (eg, due to
diuretic use and exclusion of adults 70 years or older) could
reduce generalizability to all US adults.
Conclusions
In cross-sectional data from a 2014 sample of US adults, esti-
mated mean sodium intake was 3608 mg per day. The find-
ings provide a benchmark for future studies.
