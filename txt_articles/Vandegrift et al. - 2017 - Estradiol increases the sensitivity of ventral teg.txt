Abstract
Gender differences in psychiatric disorders such as addiction may be modulated by the ste-
roid hormone estrogen. For instance, 17β-estradiol (E2), the predominant form of circulating
estrogen in pre-menopausal females, increases ethanol consumption, suggesting that E2
may affect the rewarding properties of ethanol and thus the development of alcohol use dis-
order in females. The ventral tegmental area (VTA) is critically involved in the rewarding and
reinforcing effects of ethanol. In order to determine the role of E2 in VTA physiology, gonad-
ally intact female mice were sacrificed during diestrus II (high E2) or estrus (low E2) for
electrophysiology recordings. We measured the excitation by ethanol and inhibition by
dopamine (DA) of VTA DA neurons and found that both excitation by ethanol and inhibition
by dopamine were greater in diestrus II compared with estrus. Treatment of VTA slices from
mice in diestrus II with an estrogen receptor antagonist (ICI 182,780) reduced ethanol-stim-
ulated neuronal firing, but had no effect on ethanol-stimulated firing of neurons in slices from
mice in estrus. Surprisingly, ICI 182,780 did not affect the inhibition by DA, indicating differ-
ent mechanisms of action of estrogen receptors in altering ethanol and DA responses. We
also examined the responses of VTA DA neurons to ethanol and DA in ovariectomized mice
treated with E2 and found that E2 treatment enhanced the responses to ethanol and DA in a
manner similar to what we observed in mice in diestrus II. Our data indicate that E2 modu-
lates VTA neuron physiology, which may contribute to both the enhanced reinforcing and
rewarding effects of alcohol and the development of other psychiatric disorders in females
that involve alterations in DA neurotransmission.
Introduction
Dysfunctions in dopaminergic (DA) neurotransmission contribute to many psychiatric disor-
ders including mood disorders, schizophrenia, Parkinson’s disease, Tourette’s syndrome, and
addiction [1–4]. The role of the DA system in psychiatric disorders has been established in
animal models of these conditions and using human brain imaging and post-mortem tissue

lence and severity [5]. Gender differences in the age of onset, prevalence, progression, and
severity of symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders may be due to inherent sex differ-
ences in the organization of the DA system and/or modulated by sex hormones [6–8]. It is
therefore important to understand the biological factors that underlie sex differences in DA
neurotransmission to help guide the development of future treatments for psychiatric disor-
ders that will be effective in both sexes.
The mesocorticolimbic DA system is critically involved in the development of addiction.
This system encompasses the ventral tegmental area (VTA) DA neurons and their projections
to the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and prefrontal cortex [9–11]. VTA neurons are activated
and release DA in their target areas in response to stimuli that are rewarding or novel [12],
and release of dopamine by DA VTA neurons underlies the rewarding and reinforcing effects
of drugs of abuse [13, 14]. The VTA is important for promoting alcohol consumption and
reward [15, 16]. Rodents will self-administer ethanol directly into the VTA, suggesting that at
least some of the reinforcing effects of ethanol are mediated through the VTA [16–18]. Acute
administration of ethanol dose-dependently enhances the basal firing rate of rodent VTA DA
neurons both in vitro [19, 20] and in vivo [21].
There are considerable gender differences in addiction, including differences in the
amount of use, age of initiation, reasons for abuse, development of comorbidities, and sever-
ity of health problems [22]. Although more men abuse alcohol than women, the difference in
the incidence of alcohol abuse is narrowing between genders [23, 24]. Women are more sus-
ceptible to the devastating health effects associated with alcohol abuse such as liver disease
and neurotoxicity [25, 26]. Similar to other drugs of abuse such as cocaine, women also
exhibit a greater escalation of alcohol use and are more likely to relapse in response to
stress and anxiety [27]. Studies investigating differences in alcohol consumption during the
normal human menstrual cycle are conflicting and indeterminate; thus, the precise role that
the hormonal cycle has on alcohol intake in women is unknown [27]. However, steroid hor-
mones, including estrogen, may play a role in sex differences in addiction and alcoholism
[22, 28–30].
Estrogen, specifically 17β-Estradiol (E2), may affect the normal physiology of the VTA and
the pathophysiology of disease states such as addiction. E2 modulates DA responses to psy-
chostimulants [31–34] and increases the rewarding and reinforcing properties of cocaine and
amphetamine [31, 35–41]. E2 alters mesolimbic DA transmission pre- and postsynaptically by
increasing DA synthesis, reuptake, and release and changing receptor expression and activity
[42–46]. Although much is known regarding the effects of E2 on behavioral and neurochemi-
cal responses to psychostimulants, the potential effects of E2 on behaviors related to alcohol
abuse and the physiological responses of VTA DA neurons to ethanol are less well studied. In
premenopausal women, alcohol consumption is positively correlated with serum E2 levels [47]
and E2 supplementation in ovariectomized (OVX) mice increases ethanol-stimulated DA
release in the prefrontal cortex [48]. Estrogen receptors are expressed in VTA neurons [49,
50]. However, the effects of E2 specifically on the dopamine- and ethanol-regulated responses
of VTA neurons have not been examined. Here, we used gonadally intact female mice at differ-
ent stages of the estrous cycle characterized by different circulating hormone levels and OVX
mice supplemented with E2. We tested the firing of DA neurons in response to DA and etha-
nol. We demonstrate that E2 increases the sensitivity of VTA DA neurons to both ethanol and
DA, indicating that sex differences in the DA system may be, in part, regulated hormonally.
These results have implications for alcohol use disorder and other psychiatric diseases in
women.

 Materials and methods
Animals
Female C57BL/6J mice were used for all experiments. Mice were 8 weeks old when purchased
from The Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and were tested between 10–14 weeks
of age. Mice were group-housed under a 12 hour light-dark cycle in a temperature-and-
humidity-controlled facility. Mice were treated in accordance with the National Institutes of
Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All experimental procedures were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Illinois at
Chicago and efforts were taken to alleviate suffering.
Vaginal cytology
Vaginal cytology was performed for at least two weeks in freely cycling females prior to per-
forming experiments. A cotton swab was moistened with sterile water and gently inserted less
than 1 mm into the vaginal opening and rotated. Immediately after removal from the vaginal
opening, the swab was wiped on a microscope slide and the smear analyzed by bright field
microscopy using an EVOS1 FL inverted microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Estrous
phase was determined based on vaginal cellular composition. For freely cycling mice, estrus
vaginal composition was identified by an abundance of cornified epithelial cells, while diestrus
II (herein referred to diestrus) was identified by the predominance of leukocytes in the smears
[51](Fig 1). These two phases show large differences in circulating estrogen levels in mice, and
are of substantially longer duration than either proestrus or metestrus/diestrus I [52]. For
electrophysiology, the final smears were obtained 1–2 hours prior to euthanasia.
OVX and E2 treatments
Mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xylazine
(8 mg/kg). After shaving the hair on the back of the mouse, a small incision was made on the
dorsal side, the uterine horn was pulled out of the abdominal cavity, and the ovary and associ-
ated fat pad were dissected away from the uterine horn with a cauterizer. The uterine horn was
pushed back into the abdominal cavity. The incisions were closed with sterile sutures and
wound clips. This procedure was performed bilaterally. Mice received an injection of meloxi-
cam (2 mg/kg, subcutaneous) for analgesia immediately after surgery and 24 hours later. To
confirm ovary removal, vaginal smears were taken daily from mice for 4–5 days and analyzed
using bright field microscopy as described above. All OVX mice used in these experiments

 were no longer cycling through estrous, demonstrating successful ovary removal. After 10
days of recovery from surgery, the mice were treated for three days with 0.05 mL of sesame oil
plus 10% ethanol vehicle (VEH) or E2 benzoate (EB) in VEH subcutaneously. For the first two
days of treatment, mice were injected once daily with 0.2 μg EB or VEH, which resulted in
serum E2 levels 4 hours after injection that were comparable to E2 levels in proestrus (S1 Fig).
On the final day of treatment, the mice were injected with 1 μg EB or VEH one hour before
sacrifice, which resulted in serum E2 levels 30 min after injection that were comparable to E2
levels in proestrus (S1 Fig).
Preparation of brain slices
Brain slices containing the VTA were prepared for electrophysiology as previously described
[53, 54]. Mice were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane prior to rapid removal of the brain.
Using a vibratome and cold cutting solution, a tissue block containing the VTA and substantia
nigra was cut into coronal sections of 400-μm thickness. Slices containing the VTA were
placed in a chamber containing artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF) flowing at a rate of 2 ml/
min at 35˚C. A small chamber (~0.5 ml) was used in these studies to allow the rapid applica-
tion and washout of drug solutions in the bath. The slices were incubated for one hour in the
aCSF before experiments were conducted. The composition of the aCSF was (in mM): NaCl
126, KCl 2.5, NaH2PO4 1.24, CaCl2 2.4, MgSO4 1.3, NaHCO3 26, glucose 11. The cutting
solution composition was (in mM): KCl 2.5, CaCl2 2.4, MgSO4 1.3, NaHCO3 26, glucose 11,
and sucrose 220. Both solutions were saturated with 95% O2/ 5% CO2 (pH = 7.4).
Cell identification for electrophysiology
Putative DA cells (herein referred to as VTA DA neurons) were identified by anatomical loca-
tion and electrophysiological characteristics. The VTA was visible in the slices as a grey area
medial to the substantia nigra. White matter separated the VTA from the substanta nigra. DA
neurons have been shown to have distinctive electrophysiological characteristics including
broad action potentials (at least 2.5 msec), slow spontaneous firing rate (0.5–5 Hz), and a
regular inter-spike interval. Only neurons located within the lateral VTA that conformed to
previously established criteria for DA neurons were included [55]. The criteria used for the
recorded VTA neurons are associated with DA-containing neurons projecting to the nucleus
accumbens [56], although it should be noted that there is some controversy regarding the neu-
rotransmitter identity of neurons with this electrophysiological profile [56–59]. We also tested
baclofen on each of the neurons for the quinpirole studies, and 100% of them were inhibited
by 1 μM baclofen. Baclofen has been shown to inhibit VTA DA neurons and not GABA neu-
rons in the VTA [60].
Drug administration
With the exception of the EB and VEH treatment of OVX mice, all drugs were administered
during electrophysiological experiments. When ethanol and DA were added to the aCSF, a cal-
ibrated infusion pump from stock solutions was used. The final concentrations were calculated
from the flow rate and stock solution concentrations (100 to 1000 times the desired final con-
centrations). The addition of the concentrated drugs to the flowing aCSF using the pumps was
performed in such a way as to allow the drug solution to mix completely and reach the final
desired concentration in the aCSF before reaching the slice. In some experiments, 10 μM ICI
182,780 was added to the microelectrode filling solution for pipette delivery, a technique that
has been used in the past by our lab and others [61, 62].

 Extracellular recording
Spontaneous spike frequency of the putative DA neurons was measured using extracellular
recordings; spike frequency (firing rate) was recorded and averaged over one-minute intervals.
Recordings were made using micropipettes filled with 0.9% NaCl with tip resistances of 2 to 4
MΩ. Changes in firing rate were determined as peak percentage change relative to the baseline
prior to drug administration.
Statistical analysis
Averaged numerical values are presented as the mean ± SEM. Statistical comparisons were
made using two-way ANOVA or two-way repeated measures ANOVA followed by Sidak’s
multiple comparisons tests as appropriate (Origin, Originlab, Northampton, MA or Prism,
Graphpad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA). A P value of < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
VTA neuron characteristics
A total of 121 VTA neurons were recorded in this study. Their initial basal firing rates ranged
from 0.55 to 3.921 Hz. The mean firing rate was 1.996 ± 0.80 Hz. There were no significant
differences in basal firing rate between estrus and diestrus of freely cycling mice (Estrus:
2.045 ± 0.15 Hz, Diestrus: 1.887 ± 0.16 Hz, t53 = 0.72, P = 0.48) or between EB- and vehicle-
treated OVX mice (EB-treated: 1.953 ± 0.19 Hz, VEH-treated: 2.182 ± 0.13 Hz, t50 = 1.00,
P = 0.09). All neurons conformed to the rate and patterns of DA VTA neurons as established
in the literature and in this laboratory.
Increased sensitivity of VTA DA neurons to inhibition by DA in diestrus
In addition to releasing DA onto their projection sites, DA neurons are also locally regulated
by DA [63]. This DA-mediated autoregulation inhibits the firing of DA VTA neurons through
actions at the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) [64, 65]. In order to determine whether natural
fluctuations of hormones affect responses to DA, we tested DA inhibition of VTA DA neurons
from mice in diestrus and estrus. Representative vaginal smears of the estrus and diestrus
phases of the cycle are shown in Fig 1. We found that VTA DA neurons from mice in diestrus
exhibited a significantly enhanced inhibition by DA (0.5–10 μM) compared with VTA DA
neurons from mice in estrus (Fig 2, n = 9 per group, two-way ANOVA, concentration: F4,79 =
11.05, P < 0.0001; phase: F1,79 = 4.75, P = 0.032; concentration x phase interaction: F4, 79 =
0.51, P = 0.73). For example, 5 μM DA decreased the firing rate by 48.0 ± 12.7% in neurons
from mice in diestrus, while that same concentration of DA decreased the firing rate of neu-
rons from mice in estrus by 29.6 ± 5.7%. To confirm that the enhanced inhibition observed
during diestrus is mediated by D2/D3R stimulation, we tested the effect of quinpirole, a selec-
tive D2/D3R agonist. Quinpirole more potently inhibited DA neurons from mice in diestrus
compared with estrus, similar to what we observed with DA (S2 Fig, n = 7 per group, two-way
RM ANOVA, concentration: F3, 36 = 112.2, P < 0.0001; phase: F1, 12 = 6.39, P = 0.027; interac-
tion: F 3, 36 = 3.94, P = 0.016). Post-hoc multiple comparisons tests indicated a significant
effect of 50 nM quinpirole (P = 0.001). In estrus, 50 nM quinpirole inhibited DA neurons by
36.6 ± 4.2%, while in diestrus, 50 nM quinpirole inhibited DA neurons by 72.9 ± 13.6%. These
results indicate that DA autoinhibition of VTA DA neurons fluctuates during the estrous cycle
and may be modulated by ovarian hormones.

 Increased sensitivity of VTA DA neurons to ethanol excitation in diestrus
We have established that ethanol directly increases the firing rate of VTA neurons of male
rodents [53]. To determine if natural hormonal fluctuations in female mice affect the response
of VTA DA neurons to ethanol, we tested excitation of VTA DA neurons from mice in dies-
trus and estrus by 40, 80, and 120 mM ethanol. VTA DA neurons from mice in diestrus
showed significantly greater excitation by ethanol compared with neurons from mice in estrus
(Fig 3, n = 7–9 per group, two-way ANOVA, concentration: F2, 42 = 27.74, P < 0.0001; phase:
F1, 42 = 11.76, P = 0.0014; concentration x phase interaction: F2, 42 = 2.15, P = 0.13). For exam-
ple, neurons from mice in estrus responded to 80 mM ethanol with a 12.4 ± 2.6% increase in
firing rate, whereas in neurons from mice in diestrus, the same concentration of ethanol pro-
duced a 23.7 ± 4.7% increase in firing rate. These results indicate that ethanol more potently
excites VTA DA neurons from female mice during diestrus compared with estrus, demonstrat-
ing that different hormonal states affect the response to ethanol.
E2 enhances responses of VTA DA neurons to DA and ethanol
Since E2 levels are higher in diestrus compared with estrus [52], we hypothesized that the
increased responses of VTA neurons to DA and ethanol during diestrus may be due to an

 effect of elevated E2. To more directly test this hypothesis, mice were OVX to remove circu-
lating hormones produced by the ovaries and treated systemically with daily EB or VEH
injections for three days prior to sacrifice. Brain slices were prepared one hour after the last
EB or VEH injection and VTA neurons tested for electrophysiological responses to DA
and ethanol. VTA DA neurons in OVX mice treated with EB demonstrated a significantly
increased sensitivity to DA inhibition (0.5–10 μM) compared with neurons from OVX VEH-
treated mice (Fig 4, n = 9 per group, concentration: F4, 80 = 19.05, P < 0.0001; treatment:
F1, 80 = 6.41, P = 0.013; concentration x treatment interaction: F4, 80 = 0.88, P = 0.48). For
example, 5 μM DA decreased the firing rate by 65.6 ± 13.4% in neurons from EB-treated
mice, while the decrease in firing rate in neurons from VEH-treated mice was 40.2 ± 11.2%.
This result indicates that E2 pretreatment increases the sensitivity of VTA DA neurons to
inhibition by DA.
We next tested for the effect of EB treatment on the excitation of VTA DA neurons by eth-
anol. Neurons from OVX mice treated with EB showed a significantly enhanced ethanol-
induced (40–120 mM) excitation compared with neurons from OVX VEH-treated mice (Fig
4, n = 12–13, two-way ANOVA, concentration: F2, 69 = 24.83, P < 0.0001; treatment: F 1, 69 =
7.81, P = 0.0067; concentration x treatment interaction: F2, 69 = 0.71, P = 0.49). As an exam-

 rate of 26.5 ± 4.2%, whereas neurons from VEH-treated mice responded to ethanol with an
increase in firing rate of 14.5 ± 1.6%. Because GABAergic neurotransmission in the VTA
may regulate the firing of VTA DA neurons [66], we also tested whether the enhanced etha-
nol excitation in neurons from EB-treated OVX mice was affected by GABA antagonists
(concurrent administration of bicuculline and CGP35348, 10 μM each). In the presence of
GABA antagonists, the response of VTA DA neurons to ethanol in OVX VEH- or EB-treated
mice was similar to what we observed in the absence of these antagonists, suggesting that the
increase in ethanol excitation elicited by EB is independent of GABA neurotransmission in
the VTA (S3 Fig).
Estrogen receptors in the VTA acutely regulate the sensitivity of DA
neurons to ethanol but not DA
Estrogen receptors are present in the VTA and are expressed in DA neurons [49, 50, 67, 68].
To determine if estrogen receptors in the VTA regulate the increased sensitivity of VTA DA
neurons to ethanol and DA, we treated brain slices containing the VTA with the estrogen
receptor (ERα and ERβ) antagonist ICI 182,780 and measured the electrophysiological
responses to DA and ethanol in neurons from mice in estrus and diestrus. ICI 182,780 was
delivered via the recording pipette, a method we have used successfully in the past [61]. ICI
182,780 did not affect inhibition by DA in either estrus or diestrus. However, similar to the
effect shown above in Fig 2, there was a significant main effect of estrous cycle phase, indicat-
ing enhanced DA inhibition in neurons from mice in diestrus (Fig 5, n = 6 per group, two-way
RM ANOVA, treatment: F1,10 = 1.75, P = 0.22; phase: F1,10 = 6.45, P = 0.029; treatment x phase
interaction: F1,10 = 1.62, P = 0.23). The lack of effect of ICI 182,780 on inhibition of VTA DA
neurons by DA suggests that estrogen receptors do not acutely affect DA inhibition, or func-
tion in a different brain region to modulate this effect.
In contrast, ethanol excitation of VTA DA neurons from mice in diestrus was decreased
after treatment with ICI 182,780 (Fig 5, n = 6 per group, two-way RM ANOVA, treatment:
F1, 10 = 7.29, P = 0.022; phase: F1, 10 = 1.83, P = 0.21; treatment x phase interaction: F1, 10 =
8.79, P = 0.014). Post-hoc multiple comparisons testing demonstrated a significant difference
in ethanol-stimulated firing in VTA DA neurons from mice in diestrus compared with estrus
before treatment with ICI 182,780 (P = 0.018), consistent with results shown in Fig 3. This dif-
ference in ethanol-stimulated firing between these two phases of the estrous cycle was abol-
ished after allowing 90 minutes for ICI 182,780 to diffuse from the recording pipette onto
the slice. Neurons from mice in the diestrus phase responded to 80 mM ethanol with an
18.8 ± 7.1% increase in firing rate at the beginning of the experiment, but after the 90 minute
of pipette delivery of ICI 182,780, the response to 80 mM ethanol was increased by only
8.4 ± 1.9%. As a control, we also tested if inclusion of DMSO vehicle in the recording pipette
would change the response to ethanol of VTA DA neurons from diestrus mice over the same
90-minute period. There was no change in ethanol-stimulated firing over time with DMSO
vehicle in the pipette (t4 = 0.94, P = 0.4, data not shown), indicating that the decrease in etha-
nol response from mice in diestrus after incubation with ICI 182,780 is not consequence of
time, DMSO, or repetition of ethanol administration. In addition, the response to ethanol of
VTA DA neurons from mice in estrus was not altered by ICI 182,780. At the beginning of the
experiment, neurons from mice in the estrus phase responded to 80 mM ethanol with an
increase of firing rate of 10.1 ± 4.2%; after 90 minutes of the pipette delivery of ICI 182,780,
neurons from the estrus phase responded with an 11.5 ± 5.6% increase in firing rate. These
results demonstrate that estrogen receptors in the VTA acutely regulate the enhancement of
ethanol stimulation in the diestrus phase, when E2 levels are higher than in estrus.

 Discussion
Our results show that E2 modulates the response of VTA DA neurons to ethanol and DA.
Here we tested the ethanol and DA responses of VTA neurons in both OVX and gonadally
intact female mice. We found that elevated E2 corresponded with enhanced responses in VTA
neurons. This was observed in neurons in OVX mice treated with E2 and in mice in diestrus,
where serum E2 levels have been reported to reach ~6 pg/ml [52] compared with neurons
from OVX mice and mice in estrus, where serum E2 levels have been estimated to be less than
0.3 pg/ml [52]. The responses to ethanol and DA of VTA DA neurons in mice in estrus (when
circulating E2 levels are low) are comparable to responses that we have observed previously in
male C57BL6/J mice, providing additional evidence that E2 increases the sensitivity of VTA
DA neurons to ethanol and DA [69, 70]. Although we did not measure responses of VTA DA
neurons during proestrus, when serum E2 levels in mice are slightly higher (~8 pg/mL) than
in diestrus, we would expect that VTA DA neurons from mice in proestrus would behave in a
similar manner to neurons from mice in diestrus in response to DA and ethanol. We also dem-
onstrated that the enhanced ethanol excitation, but not the enhanced DA inhibition, observed

 in VTA neurons from mice in diestrus is reversed after acute treatment with ICI 182,780, an
antagonist of the estrogen receptors ERα and ERβ.
Interestingly, we did not observe differences in basal firing rates of VTA neurons between
estrus and diestrus from freely cycling or between EB- and VEH-treated OVX mice. Other
studies have reported differences in basal firing activity according to the estrus phase of intact
rodents with single-unit extracellular in vivo measurements. Basal firing rate and bursting
were found to be greater in estrus compared with diestrus [71, 72]. One potential explanation
for this discrepancy is that we recorded from in vitro brain slices and regulatory inputs that
modulate these changes in basal firing properties may be masked or missing in our slice prepa-
ration. During slice preparation, the excitatory inputs responsible for burst firing in the VTA
are disrupted [73].
DA inhibition was enhanced in VTA neurons from gonadally intact mice in diestrus and in
OVX mice treated with EB. Inhibition of firing by D2R activation is mediated by potassium
channels activated by the βγ subunit of G proteins [74]. The alterations of responses to DA by
E2 that we observed might be due to a change in D2R expression, trafficking, G protein cou-
pling, or other downstream signaling components. Future studies will address which of these
possibilities contribute to the E2 enhancement of DA inhibition.
Acute in vitro treatment with the ER antagonist, ICI 182,780, did not alter the inhibitory
DA response of VTA DA neurons from mice in diestrus or estrus. While it is possible that
the increased DA inhibition observed in VTA neurons from mice in diestrus is not due to
increased E2 levels, this seems unlikely. We found that treatment of OVX mice with E2
resulted in increased inhibition of VTA DA neurons by DA when compared with VEH-treated
mice, similar to differences in DA responses of DA VTA neurons from mice in diestrus
(higher E2 levels) compared with estrus (lower E2 levels); these observations support the argu-
ment that E2 is responsible for increasing the sensitivity of VTA DA neurons to inhibition by
DA in intact females. It seems more likely that the alteration of D2 sensitivity is caused by
E2-induced changes in DA responsiveness in the VTA elicited prior to performing the electro-
physiology. For instance, acute ICI 182,780 treatment would not be expected to reverse the
increased DA sensitivity in high estrogen states if E2 acted prior to slice preparation to change
the expression of genes that regulate D2R signaling or trafficking (i.e. the classical or genomic
action of ERs). The timing of E2 injections in our experiments is sufficiently long to permit
genomic changes to occur, since we pre-treated the mice for three days prior to performing
the experiment. Presumably the rise in E2 levels in mice in diestrus before we prepared slices is
also long enough to elicit genomic changes that could increase the response to DA. Alterna-
tively, the effect of E2 in vivo might indirectly increase the response to DA by employing a
polysynaptic mechanism, for example. Finally, it is possible that the lack of effect of acute ICI
182,780 on DA inhibition is merely the result of E2 acting on ERs outside of the VTA to
change responses to DA in the VTA. Future experiments need to be performed to distinguish
among these possibilities.
We found that ethanol excitation was enhanced in VTA neurons from gonadally intact
mice in diestrus and OVX mice treated with EB. Increased ethanol-induced excitation of DA
neurons during elevated E2 states would lead to increased DA release, and is predicted to
enhance ethanol reward [75, 76]. Ethanol excites VTA neurons in vivo [21] and directly
increases the spontaneous firing rate of dissociated VTA DA neurons [53]. Ethanol excitation
is retained under conditions that block synaptic transmission in brain slices containing the
VTA [19] and in dissociated VTA DA neurons [53].
The increased sensitivity to ethanol of VTA DA neurons in mice in diestrus and in OVX
mice treated with EB suggests that behaviors related to the rewarding and reinforcing proper-
ties of ethanol will be enhanced when circulating E2 levels are high. Indeed, several studies

 have demonstrated that OVX mice and rats treated with E2 consume more ethanol compared
with vehicle-treated OVX mice [77–83]. In addition, female rodents tend to consume more
ethanol than male rodents [27, 84–86]. By re-examining our published studies of the ethanol
responses of VTA DA neurons in male C57BL/6J mice [69, 70], we observed that the concen-
tration-response to ethanol is similar between males and estrus females (when serum E2 con-
centrations are low). This might suggest that mice in diestrus or proestrus would consume
more ethanol than male or estrus mice. However, several studies have found that ethanol con-
sumption does not change throughout the estrous cycle in rats [85, 87, 88] and we have also
not observed differences in ethanol consumption throughout the estrous cycle in freely cycling
mice (R. Satta and A.W. Lasek, manuscript in revision). One reason for this may be that timing
is critical when testing for behavioral differences. The estrous cycle in mice and rats is very
short (~4 days) and within a specific cycle phase, hormone levels can change rapidly. Indeed,
Roberts et al did find cycle phase differences in ethanol self-administration in rats when their
cycles were synchronized using an agonist to the gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor
[88]. The sex difference in ethanol consumption observed in mice could be due to higher levels
of E2 in females contributing to increased sensitivity of VTA DA neurons to excitation by eth-
anol and perhaps higher levels of drinking. This remains to be determined, but is an important
area for future investigation.
The ethanol-induced excitation of VTA DA neurons was assessed using high concentra-
tions (40–120 mM). Although the concentrations used here were relatively high, we and others
have found that 4 hours of access to 20% ethanol in the “drinking in the dark” protocol rou-
tinely leads to blood ethanol concentrations of ~35–43 mM, with females at the high end of
that range [54, 86] (R. Satta and A.W. Lasek, manuscript in revision). In addition, the in vitro
brain slice preparation may eliminate innervation from other brain regions that may contrib-
ute to the VTA response to ethanol, such as the serotonergic innervation from the Raphe
nuclei [89]. Without these synaptic inputs, the VTA DA sensitivity to ethanol may be
suppressed.
We have demonstrated previously that ethanol-induced excitation of VTA DA neurons in
our recordings is unaltered by GABAergic or glutamatergic antagonists [90]. In the present
study, we also found that the enhancement of ethanol-stimulated firing of VTA DA neurons
by E2 is not altered by GABA receptor antagonists. Although E2 has been shown to inhibit
GABA release in the striatum and hippocampus and alter expression of GABA-A receptor sub-
units [91–93], these data suggest that the ability of E2 to increase ethanol-induced excitation of
VTA DA neurons is likely not due to changes in GABA neurotransmission elicited by E2.
In addition to finding enhanced ethanol-induced excitation of VTA DA neurons from
mice in diestrus compared with estrus, we observed that treatment of slices acutely with ICI
182,780 reduced ethanol excitation during diestrus, but not estrus. This suggests that ongoing
signaling by membrane-bound ERs in the VTA is responsible for the enhanced excitation by
ethanol, rather than the effects of ERs on transcription. These observations from mice in dies-
trus are consistent with the finding that treatment of mice with E2 increases excitation of VTA
DA neurons by ethanol. ICI 182,780 is considered to be a ‘‘pure” ERα/β antagonist [94], but
was recently found to act as an agonist at the G protein coupled ER, GPER1 [95]. We believe
that the ability of ICI 182,780 to block ethanol-induced excitation of VTA DA neurons during
diestrus is likely due to its inhibition of ERα and/or ERβ because activation of GPER1 by ICI
182,780 would have an estrogenic action rather than reversal of the estrogen effect on ethanol
potency that we observed. The mechanism of action of ICI 182,780 on inhibiting ERα activity
has been described on multiple levels including interfering with the formation of ERα dimers,
inhibiting nuclear translocation, increasing protein degradation, and blocking rapid signaling
by membrane-bound ERα [94, 96–98]. ICI 182,780 also blocks ERβ-mediated transcriptional

 activity [99] and inhibits E2-mediated changes in amphetamine-stimulated striatal DA release
in female rats [100]. The acute reduction of ethanol excitation by ICI 182,780 observed in VTA
neurons from mice in the diestrus phase suggests that the increased sensitivity to ethanol
during diestrus may be due to active engagement of ERs by E2 in the slice preparation. The
E2-mediated enhancement of ethanol-stimulated firing of VTA DA neurons might therefore
be due to rapid signaling effects mediated by membrane-bound ERs in the VTA, rather than
genomic or transcriptional actions of these receptors, although there is cross-talk between
genomic and membrane E2 action observed in regions such as the hippocampus and hypothal-
amus that could be responsible for the enhancement of ethanol excitation of VTA DA neurons
[101, 102]
We have not investigated which ER subtypes are involved in modulating DA and ethanol
sensitivity of VTA DA neurons. We predict that E2 is acting through ERα or ERβ. ERβ expres-
sion has been investigated using a transgenic reporter mouse [49] and specific antibodies [103]
and is expressed in VTA DA and non-DA neurons. We have also performed fluorescent
immunostaining for ERα in mouse VTA and have found that ERα is expressed in both VTA
DA and non-DA neurons (R. Satta and A.W. Lasek, unpublished results). It is possible that the
ability of E2 to affect responses of VTA DA neurons to ethanol and DA are through actions on
either ERα and/or ERβ. Overall the data presented here indicate that elevated estrogen states,
in both gonadally intact and E2-supplemented OVX mice, enhance ethanol excitation and
dopamine inhibition. Future studies will investigate which ERs play a role in these electrophys-
iological responses of the VTA and the molecular mechanisms for the enhanced ethanol exci-
tation and dopamine inhibition.
