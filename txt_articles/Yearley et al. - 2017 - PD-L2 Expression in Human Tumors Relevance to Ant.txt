Abstract
Purpose: Tumor-associated PD-L1 expression is predictive of
clinical response to PD-1–directed immunotherapy. However,
PD-L1–negative patients may also respond to PD-1 checkpoint
blockade, suggesting that other PD-1 ligands may be relevant to
the clinical activity ofthese therapies. Theprevalence of PD-L2, the
other known ligand of PD-1, and its relationship to response to
anti-PD-1 therapy were evaluated.
Experimental Design: PD-L2 expression was assessed in archi-
val tumor tissue from seven indications using a novel immuno-
histochemical assay. In addition, relationships between clinical
response and PD-L2 status were evaluated in tumor tissues from
patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC)
with recurrent or metastatic disease, treated with pembrolizumab.
Results: PD-L2 expression was observed in all tumor types and
present in stromal, tumor, and endothelial cells. The prevalence
and distribution of PD-L2 correlated significantly with PD-L1 (P ¼
0.0012–<0.0001); however, PD-L2 was detected in the absence of
PD-L1 in some tumor types. Both PD-L1 and PD-L2 positivity
significantly predicted clinical response to pembrolizumab on
combined tumor, stromal and immune cells, with PD-L2 predic-
tive independent of PD-L1. Response was greater in patients
positive for both PD-L1 and PD-L2 (27.5%) than those positive
only for PD-L1 (11.4%). PD-L2 status was also a significant
predictor of progression-free survival (PFS) with pembrolizumab
independent of PD-L1 status. Longer median times for PFS and
overall survival were observed for PD-L2–positive than PD-L2–
negative patients.
Conclusions: Clinical response to pembrolizumab in pati-
ents with HNSCC may be related partly to blockade of PD-1/
PD-L2 interactions. Therapy targeting both PD-1 ligands may
provide clinical benefit in these patients. Clin Cancer Res; 23(12);

Introduction
Immune checkpoint therapies targeting the programmed
cell death protein 1 (PD-1) axis have resulted in groundbreak-
ing improvements in clinical response in multiple human
cancers (1–9). The interaction of the PD-1 receptor on T cells
with its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, on tumor and immune-
infiltrating cells regulates T-cell–mediated immune responses
and may play a role in immune escape by human tumors (10).
Immune therapies targeting the PD-1 axis include monoclonal
antibodies directed at PD-1 (nivolumab, pembrolizumab),
blocking receptor interaction with both PD-L1 and PD-L2
(11–13), as well as antibodies which bind PD-L1 (atezolizu-
mab), blocking ligand interaction with PD-1 (14). Both ther-
apeutic approaches have demonstrated antitumor effects in
several cancer types.
The clinical response to anti-PD-1 targeted therapies can vary
in different tumor types, and much effort has been directed
toward finding predictive biomarkers to help identify patients
who will derive the most benefit from these therapies. Screening
of patients eligible for PD-1 axis targeted treatments has pri-
marily focused on the evaluation of PD-L1 expression in tumors,
as detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Although PD-L1
has demonstrated significant utility as a predictive biomarker in
some tumor types, subsets of PD-L1–positive patients have
responded poorly to anti-PD-1 axis therapies, whereas some
PD-L1–negative patients have shown favorable responses (2, 5,
6, 15, 16). This suggests that molecular interactions with PD-1
other than PD-L1, including PD-L2, may be relevant toward
predicting clinical responsiveness to these treatments.
The expression of PD-L2 in tumor tissue and its correlation with
response to PD-1 axis targeted therapy has been less well-studied
than PD-L1. Similar to PD-L1, PD-1 interaction with PD-L2
inhibits T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and T-cell cytol-
ysis (17, 18). Previous studies have found PD-L1 to be expressed
in T and B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages as well as non-
immune cells, whereas PD-L2 expression has been reported to be
more restricted to antigen-presenting cells, although inducible in
other immune and non-immune cells by various microenviron-
mental stimuli (17, 19–21). In limited studies, PD-L2 expression
has been demonstrated in human tumors from several indications
examined, with expression detected in the absence of PD-L1 in
some samples, and varied results regarding its relationship with
clinical response (15, 22, 23).

 Given that expression of PD-L2 either alone or in combina-
tion with PD-L1 could impact the efficacy of therapies targeting
the PD-1 axis, this study assessed the prevalence and distribu-
tion of PD-L2 in more than 400 archival human tumor samples
across 7 cancer indications using a novel PD-L2 IHC assay. The
potential relevance of PD-L2 status in patient responsiveness to
inhibition of the PD-1 checkpoint with the anti-PD-1 antibody,
pembrolizumab, was also evaluated in 172 patients with head
and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC).
Materials and Methods
A novel IHC assay for PD-L2 protein detection was developed
and applied to formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) sec-
tions of archival human tumor tissue from the Merck Palo Alto
tissue bank. Results of PD-L2 IHC staining were compared to
results of PD-L1 IHC staining (Merck clone 22C3) and to PD-L2
mRNA levels as determined using the NanoString platform. Tissue
specimens were obtained with the approval of the institutional
review boards and patients provided informed consent.
IHC assay development
Antibody generation and specificity. The primary antibody for PD-
L2 IHC in this study, clone MEB123.3G2.038 (3G2), was gener-
ated through immunization of mice with a combination of
human PD-L2-Fc (amino acids 20-219) and human PD-L2-His
(amino acids 1-219) fusion proteins and was identified by screen-
ing supernatants from 446 hybridomas (Merck Research Labora-
tories). Binding of clone 3G2 to PD-L2 but not PD-L1 was assessed
by ELISA. Recombinant PD-L2 and PD-L1 proteins were coated on
a plate at 1 mg/mL, and MEB123.3G2.038.14E (3G2) was incu-
bated with the proteins starting at 3 mg/mL and serially diluted 1:3
in an 11-point titration curve. Following binding with 3G2, a goat
anti-mouse-HRP detection antibody was incubated in the wells
and binding detected using 3,30,5,50-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB;
Supplementary Fig. S1). Clone 3G2 was evaluated on a panel of
37 normal human tissues, where abundant expression of PD-L2
was detected in placenta, in hepatocytes in liver, as well as in
multiple lymphoid tissues. Appropriateness of IHC signal distri-
bution was assessed by comparison to PD-L2 mRNA distribution
as detected by in situ hybridization (ISH; RNAscope, Advanced
Cellular Diagnostics; Supplementary Fig. S2). ISH mRNA distri-
bution corroborated IHC signal appropriateness for placenta and
lymphoid tissues but did not support the hepatocyte signal as
specific (strong cytoplasmic staining by IHC, no PD-L2 mRNA by
ISH). Because of the finding of off-target binding in normal
hepatocytes, a conservative approach was taken in assessing
appropriateness of labeling in tumor tissues, where routine
cross-checking by ISH was performed to ensure that mRNA
patterns matched those of the protein. No off-target binding was
identified in the tumor tissues evaluated. Further assessment of
signal specificity was performed by conducting a blocking study
on PD-L2–positive normal human tissues, in which pairs of slides
from each tissue were evaluated: one with 3G2 pre-adsorbed with
immunogen and one with 3G2 alone (Supplementary Fig. S3).
The appropriateness of dynamic range detection was assessed by
staining FFPE pellets from 12 cell lines with widely varying PD-L2
mRNA content, including NCIH226, HOP92, and SKBR3, and
then correlating IHC staining with mRNA content (Supplemen-
tary Fig. S4). Staining was also assessed for reproducibility using 3
normal tonsils stained on 3 successive days with pathologist
assessment of output comparability. The PD-L2 IHC signal also
significantly correlated with PD-L2 mRNA levels quantitated by
NanoString methodology in human tumor samples (P < 0.0001
to P ¼ 0.0037; Supplementary Fig. S5). Overall, these data
demonstrate the high specificity of anti-PD-L2 antibody for bind-
ing to PD-L2.
Staining. FFPE tissue sections were routinely deparaffinized and
rehydrated for PD-L2 and PD-L1 IHC. All slides were subjected to
heat-induced epitope retrieval in a PT Link unit (PT10027, Dako)
at 97�C for 20 minutes using FLEX high pH target retrieval
solution (K8012, Dako). Slides were stained on Dako Autostai-
ners using the Envision FLEX Kit, High pH (Plus) with mouse
linker (K8012, Dako) according to manufacturer's instructions.
Primary antibodies (anti-PD-L2 clone 3G2 at 0.8 mg/mL or anti-
PD-L1 clone 22C3, Merck Research Laboratories, at 2 mg/mL) were
incubated on slides for 60 minutes. Antigen–antibody binding
was visualized with 3,30-diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromogen
(K8012, Dako), and slides were counterstained with Mayer hema-
toxylin (S216-1GL, Polyscientific).
Scoring of archival tumor specimens. Archival FFPE tumor speci-
mens were sourced from the Merck Palo Alto tissue bank. Scoring
was conducted by a pathologist, with scores incorporating prev-
alence of both tumor cell and non-tumor cell labeling. A semi-
quantitative 0–5 scoring system was applied such that 0 ¼ no
staining; 1 ¼ rare individuated positive cells or only very small
focus within or directly adjacent to tumor tissue; 2 ¼ infrequent
small clusters of positive cells within or directly adjacent to tumor
tissue; 3 ¼ single large cluster, multiple smaller clusters, or
moderately dense diffuse infiltration, within or directly adjacent
to tumor tissue; 4 ¼ single very large dense cluster, multiple large
clusters or dense diffuse infiltration; 5 ¼ coalescing clusters, dense
infiltration throughout the tumor tissue. Presence or absence of
endothelial cell expression was evaluated specifically as a separate
value.
In situ hybridization. Cellular distribution of PD-L2 mRNA was
evaluated by ISH using the RNAscope platform (RNAscope 2.0
Translational Relevance
Tumor-associated PD-L1 expression has been shown to be a
predictive marker for response to anti-PD-1 axis targeted
therapies. Nonetheless, not all PD-L1–positive patients show
clinical responses to such therapies, and some PD-L1–negative
patients do respond. This suggests that other molecular inter-
actions with PD-1, such as interactions with PD-L2, may also
be important in predicting patient responses. However, studies
that assess the prevalence and distribution of PD-L2 in human
tumors have been limited. In this analysis of more than 400
archival tumor samples, PD-L2 expression was observed in
seven different tumor types and was expressed in the absence
of PD-L1 in subsets of patient samples. Moreover, PD-L2
expression
was
independently
associated
with
clinical
response in pembrolizumab-treated patients, indicating that
presence or absence of PD-L2 expression may also play a role
in response to PD-1 axis targeted therapies.

 High Definition Kit, Advanced Cell Diagnostics) according to
manufacturer's instructions. Hybridization was conducted using
anti-sense and sense DNA probes for human PD-L2 (test probe
and negative control, respectively) and anti-sense probe for PPIB
(positive control), all designed by Advanced Cell Diagnostics
(catalog numbers 316291, 551891, and 313901, respectively).
Gene expression analysis
Quantitative RT-PCR. For real-time, quantitative PCR analysis,
DNase-treated total RNA was reverse-transcribed using Quanti-
Tect Reverse Transcription (Qiagen) according to manufacturer's
instructions. Primers specific for PDCD1LG2 (PD-L2, CD273)
were obtained commercially from Applied Biosystems. Real-time
quantitative PCR was performed on the Fluidigm Biomark using
specific probe/primer mix with TaqMan Universal PCR Master
Mix with uracil-DNA glycosylase. Ubiquitin levels were measured
in a separate reaction and used to normalize the data by the DCt
method.
NanoString methodology. Tissue lysates were generated from sec-
tionedFFPEtissueaccordingtothemanufacturer'sprotocol(Nano-
String). Cellular lysate (50 ng per sample) was mixed with a
barcoded 30-biotinylated capture probe and a fluorescently tagged
50 reporter probe from the desired gene expression codeset. Probes
and target transcripts were hybridized overnight as per manufac-
turers' recommendations. Hybridized samples were run on the
NanoString nCounter instrument and then samples were scanned
at maximum scan resolution using the nCounter Digital Analyzer.
Data analysis was performed using quantile normalization in
which relative ranks of genes (across all genes on the NanoString
codeset) within each sample were replaced by values having the
same relative rank from the pooled distribution (from all samples
and genes in the dataset). All quantile-normalized data under-
went subsequent log10 transformation.
Correlation of PD-L2 expression and clinical response to anti-
PD-1 therapy
The relationship between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression and
clinical response to pembrolizumab therapy was explored in
tumor tissue samples from 172 PD-L1-positive and -unselected
patients with HNSCC from the KEYNOTE-12 trial (24, 25).
Pretreatment samples were included from patients with HNSCC
with recurrent or metastatic disease measurable per RECIST 1.1,
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance sta-
tus of 0 or 1, treated with 200 mg pembrolizumab every 3 weeks or
10/mg/kg every 2 weeks, with PD-L1 and PD-L2 IHC scoring data
available. Expression for both analytes was scored using a 1%
positivity cutoff (positive � 1%; negative < 1%) that included
evaluation of both tumor- and immune-infiltrating cells. PD-L2
expression was also assessed in tumor cells alone at a later time by
a different pathologist, as was previously reported for PD-L1
expression (24). Overall response rate (ORR) was assessed in
146 of these patients in the full analysis set population defined as
those who had received �1 dose of study drug, had a baseline
disease measurement and �1 post-baseline scan, or who had
discontinued drug due to a drug-related adverse experience or
clinical progressive disease. Progression-free survival (PFS) and
overall survival (OS) were assessed in the 172 all-patients-as-
treated population, defined as those who had received �1 dose of
study drug. Relationships with PD-L2 expression were explored by
logistic (ORR) or Cox (PFS, OS) regression analyses with or
without adjustment for variation in clinical response explained
by PD-L1 expression (i.e., including a term in the regression
model for PD-L1 positivity status in addition to the term for
PD-L2 positivity status). P values reported are one-sided in the
direction of the hypothesis of improved clinical outcome in
patients positive for PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression. Kaplan–Meier
curves were used to estimate the median survival times for PFS and
OS in PD-L2–positive and -negative patients.
Results
PD-L2 expression in tumor and immune cells
The expression of PD-L2 protein was assessed in cohorts of
several tumor types including renal cell carcinoma (RCC; n ¼ 71),
bladder carcinoma (n ¼ 34), melanoma (n ¼ 83), non–small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC; n ¼ 94), HNSCC (n ¼ 40), triple-negative
breast cancer (TNBC; n ¼ 22), and gastric carcinoma (n ¼ 73) by
IHC staining with 3G2 anti-PD-L2 antibody. As shown in Fig. 1A,
PD-L2 protein was expressed to varying degrees on stromal cells
(including immune cell infiltrate), endothelium, and tumor cells.
Each cohort was evaluated for the overall prevalence of PD-L2
expression, with stromal, tumor, and endothelial cells evaluated
together. Although PD-L2 expression was observed in all tumor
types assessed, the overall prevalence of PD-L2 expression differed
by indication (Fig. 1B). RCC was noteworthy for a predominance
of low overall levels of PD-L2 expression, whereas gastric cancer
and TNBC demonstrated moderate-to-high expression. Expres-
sion in other tumor types distributed more broadly from low to
high across evaluated samples.
When the presence or absence (scores �1 and <1, respectively,
on a 0–5 scale) of PD-L2 protein expression was evaluated by IHC
staining in the 3 categories of stromal, tumor, and endothelial
cells for each tumor type, several patterns emerged (Fig. 1C). The
presence of PD-L2 expression in stromal cells, including immune
cell infiltrate, was generally the most common and was observed
across all tumor types with relatively minimal variation. In
contrast, PD-L2 expression in tumor cells varied quite significantly
across tumor types, with none of the RCCs and few of the
melanoma samples demonstrating tumor cell expression, where-
as more than half of the HNSCC samples expressed PD-L2.
Finally, while endothelial cell expression was present in a minor-
ity of samples for most of the tumor types assessed, the prevalence
of samples with endothelial expression was notably higher in RCC
and gastric carcinomas.
The relative prevalence and distribution of PD-L2 protein in
tumor tissues in these cohorts was compared with that of PD-L1 in
additional sections of the same samples, using Merck's 22C3 anti-
PD-L1 IHC antibody (Fig. 2). In general, distributional patterns
and prevalence of PD-L2 closely mirrored those of PD-L1, as
illustrated in Fig. 2A and B. At higher magnification (Fig. 2I and J),
intratumoral and peripheral expression of both PD-L1 and PD-L2
were evident. However, a significant number of samples exhibited
discordance between PD-L2 and PD-L1 with some showing PD-
L1 signal in the absence of PD-L2, as observed in Fig. 2C and D,
and other samples displaying PD-L2 expression in the absence of
PD-L1, as seen in Fig.2E–H. The percentage of samples in each
cohort that showed PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression scores differing
by greater than or equal to 2 increments on the 0–5 scale
employed is presented in Fig. 2K.
When the overall expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 was com-
pared across all samples (using the same 0 to 5 scoring system and

 evaluating combined expression by both tumor and non-tumor
cells for both biomarkers), the scores were found to be signifi-
cantly correlated (P ¼ 0.0012 to P < 0.0001) for all indications
examined (Fig. 3). The strongest relationship between PD-L1 and
PD-L2 (R2 ¼ 0.6238) was observed for TNBC, with no significant
discordance between PD-L2 and PD-L1 expression for any of the
samples. For all other indications, while PD-L2 and PD-L1
expression scores were significantly correlated, discordant expres-
sion was observed in some samples. Bidirectional discordant
expression was observed for melanoma and RCC, with some
samples showing PD-L1 expression well in excess of PD-L2, and
others displaying PD-L2 expression well in excess of PD-L1.
Primarily unidirectional discordance was observed in other indi-
cations examined, with PD-L1 expressed in excess of PD-L2 in a
subset of NSCLC and bladder tumor samples, but PD-L2
expressed in excess of PD-L1 in a subset of HNSCC and gastric
tumor samples.
Relationship of PD-L2 expression and clinical response to anti-
PD-1 therapy
The clinical relevance of PD-L2 expression was evaluated in
tumor tissue samples derived from 172 pembrolizumab-treated
patients with HNSCC with recurrent or metastatic disease in the
KEYNOTE-12 trial who had PD-L2 and PD-L1 IHC scoring data
available. The median age of the patients sampled was 60 years
(range, 37–84 years), most were male (83.1%) and a large
proportion
were
human
papillomavirus
(HPV)-negative
(65.7%; Table 1). The majority of patients were ECOG status 1

 positivity was significantly associated with HPV status at the 0.05
significance level.
ORRs were assessed as a function of PD-L1 and PD-L2 status
(positivity cutoff � 1%) in 146 patients in the full analysis set
population by IHC staining in combined tumor- and immune-
infiltrating cells. Of these, 126 (86.3%) patients had tumors that
were scored as PD-L1–positive, 94 (64.3%) as PD-L2–positive, 20
(13.6%) as PD-L1–negative, and 52 (35.6%) as PD-L2–negative
(Table 2). The response rates in the PD-L1 [23.0%; 95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 16.0–31.4] and PD-L2 (26.6%; 95% CI, 18.0–
36.7)–positive patients were both numerically higher than the
response rates in the PD-L1- and PD-L2–negative patients (5.9%;
95% CI, 0.1–28.7; Table 2). Further evaluation of PD-L2 status in
a logistic regression model adjusting for PD-L1 status suggested
that PD-L2 positivity provided additional predictive value for
determining response (P ¼ 0.038). The ORR was greatest in
patients who were positive for both PD-L1 and PD-L2 and was
2-fold higher (27.5%; 95% CI, 18.6–37.8) than in patients whose
tumors were positive only for PD-L1 (11.4%; 95% CI, 3.2–26.7).
When PD-L2 expression was evaluated in tumor cells only, PD-
L2–positive (cutoff � 1%) patients showed an ORR of 26.5%
(95% CI, 14.9–41.1) and PD-L2–negative patients showed an
ORR of 16.7% (95% CI, 9.8–25.6), the latter reflecting the poorer
sensitivity to detect responders when PD-L2 was scored in tumor
alone (44.8%) than when scored in both tumor and inflamma-
tory cells (83.3%). Logistic regression testing adjusting for PD-L1
status did not show statistically significant additional predictive
value for determining response when PD-L2 was scored on tumor
alone (P ¼ 0.188). These results are consistent with previous
findings in this cohort showing that PD-L1 expression in com-
bined tumor and immune cells was significantly associated with

 -negative status was not significantly associated with PFS at the
0.05 level (P ¼ 0.080). However, PD-L2 positivity was a statis-
tically significant predictor of PFS (P ¼ 0.005) and remained
significantly associated with PFS after adjustment for PD-L1
positivity status (P ¼ 0.013). The relationships between OS and
PD-L1 andPD-L2 were similarly assessed. Astatistically significant
association of PD-L1 status with OS (P ¼ 0.033) was observed.
PD-L2 status was also significantly associated with OS (0.030),
and in a model that included terms for both measures, after
adjustment for PD-L1 status, PD-L2 status was no longer signif-
icant (P ¼ 0.112). The median PFS times for PD-L2–negative and
PD-L2–positive patients were 59 and 65 days, respectively, and
median OS times were 199 and 303 days, respectively (Fig. 4).
Discussion
In this study, PD-L2 expression was assessed across more
than 400 archival samples from 7 tumor types using a novel
IHC assay. PD-L2 expression generally correlated with that of
PD-L1; however, PD-L2 expression was also present in the
absence of PD-L1 in subsets of patient samples. In a cohort
of pembrolizumab-treated patients with HNSCC, PD-L2 pos-
itivity was significantly associated with ORR regardless of PD-
L1 status, and ORR was greatest in patients expressing both PD-
L1 and PD-L2 ligands. PD-L2 expression was a significant
predictor of PFS and was associated with longer median sur-
vival times for both PFS and OS. These findings suggest that
PD-L2 may play a role in clinical responses observed with anti-
PD-1 therapy, consistent with the ability of PD-1 antibodies
like pembrolizumab to block the interaction of PD-1 with both
PD-L1 and PD-L2.
PD-L1 expression has been shown to be related to clinical
response to anti-PD-1 axis therapies in NSCLC (2, 26–28),
metastatic urothelial cancer (29–31), and melanoma (4–6,

 32–34). While PD-L1 is predictive of response in all of these
tumor types, low response rates are still observed in PD-L1–
negative patients. Several possible explanations have been pro-
posed for these findings, including intratumoral heterogeneity of
PD-L1 expression, the dynamic nature of PD-L1 expression in the
tumor microenvironment, and variation in detection methods as
well as differing cell types evaluated (35). PD-L1 expression is
often found in regions of active T-cell inflammation within the
tumor environment, driven by signals such as IFNg in response to
immune-mediated attack, thus its presence may be indicative of
an immune active milieu engaged in an antitumor response (34–
37). However, some oncogenic signals also induce PD-L1 expres-
sion, and further studies are needed to better understand the
underlying mechanisms involved in induction of PD-L1 expres-
sion and their relationship to clinical response to PD-1 checkpoint
blockade (38, 39).
Limited studies have assessed a potential role for PD-L2 in
predicting patient response to anti-PD-1 axis therapy (15, 22,
23). PD-L2 has been found to be highly upregulated on certain
B-cell lymphomas, including primary mediastinal and follicular
lymphomas, as well as Hodgkin lymphoma (40, 41). In a recent
study of 38 pretreatment tumor specimens from patients with
advanced and refractory cancers using a different PD-L2 IHC
assay from that employed here, 8 (21%) of the evaluated speci-
mens demonstrated PD-L2 expression, including RCC (n ¼ 1),
melanoma (n ¼ 5), and NSCLC (n ¼ 2; ref. 22). PD-L2 protein
was observed in tumor cells or infiltrating immune cells and was
associated with PD-L1 expression in all cases but one; however,
correlation of PD-L2 expression with response to PD-1 axis
targeted therapy was not reported. In another analysis of tumor
samples from patients with advanced cancer (NSCLC, melano-
ma, RCC, colorectal, gastric, and HNSCC), PD-L2 expression did
not appear to be associated with resistance to anti-PD-L1 ther-
apy, and some patients with PD-L2–positive tumors showed
objective clinical responses (15). Recently, PD-L2 RNA expres-
sion was detected in RCC, melanoma, metastatic urothelial, and
NSCLC tumors in immune-infiltrating cells and generally cor-
related with that of PD-L1. PD-L1 and PD-L2 protein expression
were not evaluated in this study (23). Higher levels of both PD-
L1 and PD-L2 RNA were associated with improved OS to anti-
PD-L1 therapy with atezolizumab across the 4 tumor types.
However, these studies did not assess whether PD-L2 was pre-
dictive of response independent of PD-L1 status and did not
assess responses in patients who were discordant for PD-L1 and
PD-L2 expression.
In our study, PD-L2 expression was detected by IHC staining to
some extent in all 7 tumor types assessed, with the highest
expression levels in TNBC and gastric carcinoma, rare-to-low
expression in RCC, and moderate expression in bladder, NSCLC,
HNSCC, and melanoma. PD-L2 expression was detected with the
highest frequency in stromal cells including immune cell infiltrate
and was also found in endothelial cells and in tumor cells with
more variability across tumor types. The finding of endothelial
PD-L2 expression in many tumors is of particular interest given
the high potential for interaction of PD-L2 with PD-1 on T cells
exiting the vasculature and trafficking into tumor tissue. The fact
that this interaction may be physiologically relevant is supported
by evidence which has demonstrated the capacity of endothelial
PD-L2 to downregulate CD8 T-cell activation and cytolysis.(18)
However, an analysis of the relationship between endothelial cell
PD-L2 expression and response in patients with HNSCC in our
study did not show significant predictive value (data not shown).
Although the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 was strongly cor-
related in all the tumor types evaluated in our analysis, PD-L2 was
expressed within some tumors in the absence of PD-L1 and was
independently associated with clinical response in a cohort of
pembrolizumab-treated patients with HNSCC when assessed in
combined tumor and immune cells. The correlation of PD-L1 and
PD-L2 expression detected by IHC across tumor types and the
higher ORR to pembrolizumab observed in patients expressing
both ligands in our study is consistent with the known upregula-
tion of both PD-L1 and PD-L2 in the INFg pathway (17, 22, 42).
The differential expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 observed in some
tumor types may be related to other additional inducers of PD-L2
expression (17, 22, 42).
Strengths of this study include the evaluation of PD-L2 expres-
sion in a large number of samples across 7 indications and the
ability to assess the relationship between PD-L2 status and clinical
response to anti-PD-1 therapy with pembrolizumab. Although a
highly selective IHC assay was validated and optimized for PD-L2
detection in this study, direct comparison of our results to other
studies is limited by technical differences in antibodies, staining
methods, and scoring methods. A positivity cutoff for PD-L2
expression was not designated in this exploratory analysis of
archival samples, and as such, the expression data are described
in relative terms. We were also unable to assess PD-L2 expression
in relation to patient clinical characteristics for the 400 archival
samples, due to heterogeneous and sometimes sparse clinical
annotation, nor the relationship of PD-L2 to other components of
the immune milieu in the patients with HNSCC due to limitations
on tissue availability. Thus, future studies are needed to address
these relationships. It should be noted that although PD-L2 was
present to some extent in all tumor indications evaluated, assess-
ment of clinical response to pembrolizumab therapy was con-
ducted only in patients with HNSCC. Although the expression of
PD-L2 in combined tumor- and immune-infiltrating cells
appeared to be more sensitive for detecting responders than
expression in tumor cells alone, these results are considered
exploratory because the study was not designed to make a formal
comparison between these 2 methods. Nonetheless, these results
are consistent with previous observations showing that PD-L1
expression in combined tumor- and immune-infiltrating cells is
more predictive of response than expression in tumor cells alone
in patients with HNSCC (24).
In summary, our study showed that PD-L2 expression is present
in many tumor types, and while generally associated with PD-L1,
can also occur in the absence of PD-L1, despite the fact that both
ligands are generally upregulated in T-cell–inflamed microenvir-
onments in the presence of IFNg. Moreover, PD-L2 expression was
independently associated with improved clinical outcomes
including high ORRs and longer PFS in patients with HNSCC.
This suggests that PD-L2 expression may provide information
beyond that of PD-L1 in predicting clinical response to anti-PD-1
targeted agents, which block the interactions of both PD-L1 and
PD-L2 with PD-1 and may help in identifying patients who may
derive benefit from these therapies. Further studies are needed to
more fully understand the clinical relevance and predictive value
of PD-L2 in cancer immunotherapy.
