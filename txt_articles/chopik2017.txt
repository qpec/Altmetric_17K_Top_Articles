Associations among relational values, support,
health, and well-being across the adult lifespan
WILLIAM J. CHOPIK

Abstract
Is the link between close relationships and health and well-being static across the lifespan, or are the benefits most
evident in older adulthood, when concerns about physical health are greater? In Study 1, a cross-sectional survey of
271,053 adults, valuing friendships was related to better functioning, particularly among older adults, whereas valuing
familial relationships exerted a static influence on health and well-being across the lifespan. In Study 2, a longitudinal
study of 7,481 older adults, only strain from friendships predicted more chronic illnesses over a 6-year period; support
from spouses, children, and friends predicted higher subjective well-being over an 8-year period.
Engaging and investing in close relationships
are associated with a variety of psychologi-
cal and physical health benefits. The quality
of close relationships has been linked to
healthier behavior, lower incidence of chronic
illnesses, higher levels of happiness, and lower
mortality (Holt-Lunstad, Smith, & Layton,
2010; Saphire-Bernstein & Taylor, 2013).
Researchers often assume that the enhancing
effects of investing in close relationships are
present throughout the lifespan (House, Lan-
dis, & Umberson, 1988) and are of particular
importance to older adults during a time in
which physical health begins to decline (Corn-
well & Waite, 2009). However, no study has
compared the relative magnitude of the effect
that different close relationships (e.g., friend-
ships, family, spouses) have on well-being and
health among younger, middle-aged, and older
adults.

Social support, health, and happiness across
the lifespan
Investing in social roles and relationships
enables individuals to reap the benefits of
those institutions (Roberts, Wood, & Smith,
2005). As a result, the degree to which individ-
uals value different types of relationships (i.e.,
how important my family is) can be a proxy
for the degree to which they allocate effort and
resources to these relationships (Carstensen,
Isaacowitz,
&
Charles,
1999).
Likewise,
investing in close relationships yields greater
support from these relationships. There is now
a large body of research supporting the idea
that close relationships enhance health and
well-being across the lifespan. Harmonious
family relationships have a long history of
endowing positive effects on people, whether
those relationships are with spouses or other
immediate family members (e.g., Solomon &
Jackson, 2014; Umberson, 1992).
What about other nonspousal/familial rela-
tionships? The relative influence of nonfamilial
relationships, like friendships, on health and
well-being across the lifespan has been his-
torically understudied in research on lifespan
development (Hartup & Stevens, 1999). The
little research that does exist on the role of
friendships suggests that friendships can also
enrich health and well-being. Health and

well-being are often fostered (or diminished)
through friendship networks (Smith & Chris-
takis, 2008). For example, the smoking and
substance abuse behavior of friends predicts
the likelihood of initiation, continuation, and
cessation of these behaviors in adolescence
(Andrews, 2002; Urberg, Degirmencioglu, &
Pilgrim, 1997). Targeting weight-loss inter-
ventions toward one person often causes
weight loss in his or her friends as well (Gorin
et al., 2005; Wing & Jeffery, 1999). Happiness,
loneliness, depression, and health behaviors
have also been shown to spread through
social networks, including friendships (Rosen-
quist, Fowler, & Christakis, 2011; Smith &
Christakis, 2008).
There are many mechanisms through which
social relationships can affect health and
well-being (Krause & Hayward, 2015). For
example, social relationships provide us with
a sense of control and purpose in life and
are a source of self-esteem—all of which
buffer against the negative health effects of
stress (Leary, Tambor, Terdal, & Downs,
1995; Rowe & Kahn, 1997). Negative or
stressful interactions with close others can
also lead to greater stress and inflammation
by activating neuroendocrine stress response
systems (Pietromonaco, Uchino, & Dunkel
Schetter, 2013; Yang et al., 2016). Social rela-
tionships can also aid in us adopting positive
health behaviors (Jackson, Steptoe, & Wardle,
2015). Thus, when close relationships are
going well and are positive, they can provide
health-enhancing
benefits
(Uchino,
2006);
when close relationships are going poorly
and are stressful, they can exacerbate exist-
ing health problems or even create new ones
(Pietromonaco et al., 2013).
However, the relative influence of different
types of relationships on health and happiness
across the lifespan is hard to quantify. Each
of these relationships (e.g., family, friends,
spousal relationships) is often tested in iso-
lation of each other or averaged into a global
measure of social support or relationship
investment (Dupertuis, Aldwin, & Bosse,
2001). Studies rarely examine all of these rela-
tionships simultaneously to compare whether
the benefits of friendships for well-being
remain over and above the effects of relation-
ships in other domains, like with children or
spouses. The few studies that do examine the
entirety of relationships in peoples’lives reveal
the value of making this effort. For example,
Christakis and Fowler (2007) examined the
spread of obesity through a large social net-
work over a 32-year period. They found that
the likelihood of a person becoming obese
was partially determined by whether someone
in their social network became obese during
that same time period. However, the influence
of different types of relationships on health
was also tested. Friends exerted the largest
influence on obesity—if a person’
s friend
became obese, the likelihood that they became
obese was 57%. The effects that siblings (40%)
and spouses (37%) had on obesity were also
influential, albeit slightly lower. Bearman and
Moody (2004) also found that a recent sui-
cide by a friend increased the risk of suicidal
ideation and attempts for individuals, but hav-
ing a suicidal relative affected only ideation.
Thus, there is some evidence that although all
relationships that provide support are impor-
tant, some relationships might be more influ-
ential in some domains compared to others.
Furthermore, previous studies often exam-
ine these effects in groups of participants that
are developmentally homogenous (e.g., only
younger adults or only older adults). Including
participants from a large age range will enable
researchers to test whether certain types of
relationships become more or less important
for health and well-being across the lifespan.
Do close relationships have a static influence
on health and well-being across the lifespan,
such that there is a consistent effect of close
relationships on health and well-being at every
age? Or do some close relationships become
increasingly more important for health and
well-being as people age?
These questions were examined in two
large, representative panel studies. In Study
1, in a large cross-sectional sample from
nearly 100 countries, the relation between
valuing
close
relationships
(e.g.,
familial
and friendships) on health and well-being
across the lifespan was tested. In Study 2, in a
longitudinal sample of older adults, different
sources of social support and strain (i.e.,
 Relational values, social support, and well-being
3
spousal, children, family, and friends) were
used to predict the onset of chronic illnesses
and changes in subjective well-being over time.
Study 1
In Study 1, a large cross-sectional sample
was used as an exploratory test of whether
the association between valuing close rela-
tionships (e.g., family and/or friendships) and
health and well-being was static across the
lifespan. There are many different inventories
used to assess values, particularly interper-
sonal values (Cheng & Fleischmann, 2010).
One of the most widely used models is Ingle-
hart’
s (2008) distinction between survival and
self-expansion values. Among his taxonomy
of self-expansion values are interpersonal
trust and investment, which were the focus of
Study 1. Because interpersonal values often
predict future behavior and greater investment
and involvement in close relationships (Eyal,
Sagristano, Trope, Liberman, & Chaiken,
2009; Locke, 2000), valuing family and friend
relationships served as proxies for relationship
involvement across the lifespan. Although
these are imperfect measures of relationship
involvement, there is a considerable amount
of evidence demonstrating that if individuals
value relationships highly, they are more likely
to reap the benefits of them (Locke, 2000).
Furthermore, social support and strain from
particular relationships were the focus of a
follow-up study, Study 2.
The World Values Survey (WVS), a large
cross-sectional survey of values across coun-
tries, was used to assess the relative impact
of valuing family and friend relationships on
health and well-being across the adult lifespan.
The degree to which participants valued family
and friend relationships were used as predic-
tors of health and well-being. Furthermore, the
moderating effect of age was tested to compare
the magnitude of this effect among younger,
middle-aged, and older adults.
Method
Participants and procedure
Participants
included
271,053
individuals
(51% female) from the WVS (see Inglehart,
Foa, Peterson, & Welzel, 2008). Since 1981,
the
WVS
has
interviewed
representative
national
samples
from
several
countries
around the world. Information on publications,
findings, methodology, and free data access
are available at http://www.worldvaluessurvey
.org. For the current study, data from Waves
2 to 5 of the WVS were aggregated, and
97 countries are represented in the current
report. Primary study variables were not col-
lected at Wave 1. Sample sizes ranged from
374 (Dominican Republic) to 14,345 (South
Africa), with an average sample size of 2,794
(SD = 2,078).
The
overall
sample
ranged
in age from 15 to 99 years (M = 40 years,
SD = 16 years); the median level of education
was secondary education. Participant birth
year ranged from 1900 to 1999 (M = 1,964,
SD = 17). Each decade of life was well rep-
resented (e.g., 15–19 years: 14,787; 20–29
years: 69,038; 30–39 years: 60,871; 40–49
years: 50,454; 50–59 years: 36,264; 60–69
years: 24,708; 70+ years: 14,931). All data are
cross-sectional.1
Measures
Relational values. In Waves 2–5, participants
were asked to indicate how important (a) fam-
ily and (b) friends were in their lives on a scale
ranging from 1 (very important) to 4 (not at
all important). Scores were recoded such that
higher values reflected more importance placed
on these domains.
Self-rated health. Health was assessed at each
wave with a single item, “All in all, how would
you describe your state of health these days?”
Participants rated their health on a scale rang-
ing from 1 (very good) to 4 (poor). Responses
were reverse scored so that higher values
reflected better self-rated health. Numerous
studies have shown that self-rated health
measures are strong predictors of mortality
1. Cultural variation in the relationships between fam-
ily and friendship importance on health was not the
focus of the current report. The worldwide sample was
employed to maximize the number of available par-
ticipants at each age. Thus, the multilevel analyses
account for the fact that participants are nested within
countries but do not formally model any Level 2 (e.g.,
country-level) predictors.

Happiness and subjective well-being. Happi-
ness was measured with a single item, “Taking
all things together, would you say you are … ”
Participants rated their happiness on a scale
ranging from 1 (very happy) to 4 (not at all
happy). Responses were reverse scored so that
higher values reflected more happiness. Sub-
jective well-being was measured with a single
item, “All things considered, how satisfied are
you with your life as a whole these days?” Par-
ticipants responded to this item on a 10-point
scale ranging from 1 (completely dissatisfied)
to 10 (completely satisfied).
Results
Multilevel analyses
Because
respondents
were
nested
within
countries, three multilevel random coefficient
models (for health, happiness, and well-being)
were created using the SPSS MIXED proce-
dure (Peugh & Enders, 2005). Participant age,
age2, importance placed on family relation-
ships, importance placed on friendships, and
the interactions between these variables with
age were treated as predictors of participant
health, happiness, and well-being, respec-
tively. Age2 was included in each model to
capture the curvilinear relation of well-being
across the lifespan that many studies have
previously found (e.g., Baird, Lucas, & Don-
nellan, 2010). Age and importance placed
on family/friendships were centered prior to
computing the interaction terms. Participant
gender (−1 = male, 1 = female), marital status
(−1 = single, 1 = partnered), education, and
birth year were included as covariates.2
Results from these multilevel models are
presented in Table 1. The linear effect of age
2. Because
the
data
in
the
current
study
were
cross-sectional, it is difficult to draw developmen-
tal conclusions about how interpersonal values predict
health and happiness when examining age differences.
Luckily, because the WVS was collected over a 25-year
period (from 1989 to 2014), several cohorts of individ-
uals were present across the five waves of data included
in the current report. Thus, controlling for birth year
makes an 18-year-old individual born in 1971 and an
18-year-old individual born in 1996 somewhat more
comparable. Although this does not entirely rule out
was significant for health, such that older adults
reported worse health compared to younger
adults. The linear and quadratic effects of age
were significant for both happiness and sub-
jective well-being, such that both were lowest
among middle-aged adults and higher among
younger and older adults.
Placing higher importance on family and
friend relationships was associated with better
health, greater happiness, and greater subjec-
tive well-being across the lifespan. For the
most part, these were static associations that
did not differ (i.e., were not moderated) by
age. However, the effect of valuing friend-
ships on each of the dependent variables
increased with age as evidenced by significant
Age2 × Friendship importance interactions in
each model. As seen in Figures 1–3, individu-
als who placed high importance on friendships
had particularly better health, happiness, and
subjective well-being at older ages than indi-
viduals who did not place as high importance
on friendships. Finally, a significant Age ×
Family Importance interaction emerged for
subjective well-being (but not health and
happiness). The pattern of this interaction was
similar to that in the other figures—individuals
who placed higher importance on family rela-
tionships reported higher levels of well-
being, particularly in older adulthood. The
Age2 × Family Importance interaction predict-
ing subjective well-being was not significant.3
Discussion
Study
1
examined
associations
between
valuing close relationships and health and
happiness across the lifespan. Valuing family
the possibility of cohort effects, it does enhance the
likelihood that age differences observed in health,
happiness, and well-being result from developmental
processes rather than processes resulting from different
cohorts being psychologically different. Only cohort
sequential studies, in which the people from many
different cohorts are followed longitudinally over large
stretches of time, can definitively separate the effects
of development from cohort (Elder & Giele, 2009;
Roberts, Walton, & Viechtbauer, 2006).
3. In a series of follow-up analyses, models were rerun as
fixed effects regressions in which country was entered
as a dummy coded variable. The results from these
analyses did not differ substantively from the results
presented in Table 1.

and friendship relationships was associated
with greater health and higher happiness over-
all. However, only valuing friendships became
a stronger predictor of health and happiness
at advanced ages. These findings are in line
with previous research showing the health and
hedonic benefits of close relationships (House
et al.,
1988;
Saphire-Bernstein
&
Taylor,
2013). Furthermore, the fact that friendship
showed stronger effects in older adulthood
than familial relationships underscores the
importance of examining multiple relation-
ships simultaneously (Giles, Glonek, Luszcz,
& Andrews, 2005). In Study 2, the effect of
friendships on health and happiness—as well
as other relationships—was examined in a
large sample of older adults.
Although Study 1 provided some evidence
that friendships predict better happiness and
health over time, there are some notable lim-
itations. First, the data were cross-sectional.
Having participants at different ages can
provide insight into developmental processes,

but it also leaves open the interpretation that
there were preexisting differences between
birth cohorts in this study. Thus, longitudinal
data are needed to strengthen the claim that
friendships are associated with better health
and well-being in later life over and above the
effect of other relationships. Second, due to
the limited survey items available, only two
(single-item) measures of relationship impor-
tance were measured. Multi-item measures
can more reliably assess the degree to which
people invest in and receive support from these
relationships. Study 2 not only uses multi-item
measures but also assesses the quality of actual
relationships in participants’ lives rather than
how much they value close relationships.
Third, the family importance item lumped in
several distinct relationships—relationships
with spouses, children, and other immediate
family. Each of these relationships could have
distinct influences on predicting health and
well-being across the lifespan. Fourth, the
people in our lives do not always provide
support; indeed, their presence can oftentimes

be quite stressful. There is now a growing
literature suggesting that it is appropriate to
distinguish between the support and strain
provided by different agents in people’
s social
networks (Darbonne, Uchino, & Ong, 2013;
Walen & Lachman, 2000). In Study 2, the
unique effects of support and strain from
different sources on health and happiness
were examined. Fifth, single-item measures
of health and happiness were used in Study
1. The use of a subjective health measure is
particularly problematic as it has been shown
to be biased by psychological processes and
assesses things beyond objective health status
(Jylhä, 2009; Wu et al., 2013). In Study 2, a
count of chronic illnesses was used as a more
objective measure of health status.
Study 2
In Study 2, a large sample of older adults
was used to examine whether the effects of
receiving support and strain from different
relationship sources (i.e., spouses, children,
family, friends) predicted changes in health
(over 6 years) and subjective well-being
(over 8 years). To this end, a sample of over
7,000 older adults was used to test whether
support from different types of relationships
was associated with better health and sub-
jective well-being longitudinally. Thus, the
moderating role of time was entered into the
model. Study predictions, preregistration, and
syntax for the models tested in Study 2 are
available on the Open Science Framework
(https://osf.io/9jpux/).
Confirmatory
factor
analyses suggested that one of the measures
was better conceptualized as having two fac-
tors, so this preregistration was later relaxed to
reflect this and the inclusion of the subjective
well-being measure, which became available
after the study was preregistered.
Method
Participants and procedure
Participants
were
7,481
older
adults
(Mage = 68 years,
SD = 10 years;
58.1%
female) from the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS). Participants averaged 13 (SD = 3)
years of education. HRS is a nationally rep-
resentative and prospective panel study that
has surveyed more than 22,000 Americans
aged 50+ every 2 years (Sonnega et al., 2014).
Data have been collected since 1992. The
current study reports on psychological, health,
and covariate data collected from 2006 to
2014. The University of Michigan’
s Institute
for Social Research is responsible for the
study and provides extensive documentation
about the protocol, instrumentation, sampling
strategy, and statistical weighting procedures.
Measures
Sources of support and strain. Social support
and strain were indexed for the following rela-
tionships: spouses, children, family members
(immediate family), and friends. Three ques-
tions were asked about the support derived
from each relationship (e.g., “How much do
they really understand the way you feel about
things?”). Four questions were asked about
the strain derived from each relationship (e.g.,
 8
W. J. Chopik
“How much do they let you down when you are
counting on them?”). Participants responded
to each question on a scale ranging from 1 (a
lot) to 4 (not at all). Immediately following the
questions about spousal and parent–child rela-
tionships, participants were directed to think of
“any other immediate family, for example, any
brothers or sisters, parents, cousins or grand-
children” to distinguish these immediate fam-
ily relationships from spouses and children.
A series of confirmatory factor analyses
revealed a two-factor solution for support
and
strain
for
spouses,
χ2(13) = 44.95,
p < .001, comparative fit index (CFI) = .956,
root mean square error of approximation
(RMSEA) = .018, αsupport = .81, αstrain = .78;
children, χ2(13) = 33.74, p < .001, CFI = .974,
RMSEA = .015,
αsupport = .83,
αstrain = .78;
immediate family, χ2(13) = 42.17, p < .001,
CFI = .971,
RMSEA = .017,
αsupport = .86,
αstrain = .78; and friends, χ2(13) = 25.75, p <
.001, CFI = .979, RMSEA = .011, αsupport =
.84, αstrain = .76).4 Responses were scored
such that higher values corresponded to higher
support/strain.
Chronic illness. An index of eight major
chronic illnesses was computed for each
participant at each wave. Participants were
asked to report if he or she was diagnosed
by a physician with any of the following: (a)
high blood pressure; (b) diabetes; (c) cancer
or a malignant tumor of any kind; (d) lung
disease; (e) coronary heart disease including
heart attacks, angina, and congestive heart
failure; (f) emotional, nervous, or psychi-
atric problems; (g) arthritis or rheumatism;
and (h) stroke. The number of major health
problems was summed so that higher values
reflect more health problems. This index of
chronic illnesses assesses multiple morbidities
among older adults and is compiled by the
RAND Corporation in consultation with HRS.
Chronic illnesses were assessed four times (in
2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012). The RAND 2014
index of chronic illnesses was not available at
the time of the writing of this report.
4. The fitting of a two-factor model significantly improved
the overall fit for spouses, children, immediate fam-
ily, and friends compared to a one-factor solution,
χ2
(diff)s > 148.87, ΔCFIs > .162, ΔRMSEA > .010.
Subjective well-being. The well-established
Satisfaction with Life Scale was administered
to
assess
subjective
well-being
(Diener,
Emmons, Larsen, & Griffin, 1985). A sample
item is “In most ways my life is close to my
ideal.” Participants rated the extent to which
they agreed with each of the five items on a
scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to
7 (strongly agree; αmean = .89). The response
format differed between a 6-point scale (in
2006) and a 7-point scale (in 2010 and 2014).
The items were thus recoded to a 5-point
scale to be consistent across waves. Subjective
well-being was assessed thrice (in 2006, 2010,
and 2014).
Results
Longitudinal analyses
To examine longitudinal changes in chronic
illnesses
and
subjective
well-being
and
whether these changes were moderated by
support/strain received from different sources,
two multilevel models were constructed. Mul-
tilevel modeling allows for the analysis of the
entire sample, whereas traditional regression
approaches utilize a listwise deletion of sub-
jects who do not have complete data on all
measures. Thus, if an individual had missing
data on spousal support/strain (e.g., if they
were not married), the effect is only estimated
among people with data on this variable.
Chronic illnesses and subjective well-being at
each wave were treated as within-subjects vari-
ables that varied over time. The linear effect
of time was modeled on these within-subject
observations. Support and strain from spouses,
children, family, and friends were entered
as time-invariant predictors of changes in
chronic illnesses and subjective well-being.
Furthermore, interactions between each of the
support/strain sources and time were included
to test whether the association between sup-
port and health became stronger, weaker, or
stayed the same over time in older adulthood.
Participant gender (−1 = male, 1 = female),
marital status (−1 = single, 1 = partnered), age
(at Wave 1), and education (at Wave 1) were
included as covariates. Because significance
levels in multilevel growth curve modeling
can occasionally be inaccurate (Raudenbush
 Relational values, social support, and well-being
9
& Bryk, 2002; Snijders & Bosker, 2012),
likelihood ratio tests were conducted to exam-
ine the contribution of each main effect and
interaction to the total variance explained by
the overall model. Only terms that yielded a
significant positive likelihood ratio test are
discussed. Negative likelihood ratios suggest
that the overall model fit worsened by the
inclusion of that particular term.
The results from these multilevel models are
presented in Tables 2 (chronic illnesses) and 3
(subjective well-being).
The number of chronic illnesses tended to
increase over time on average. Being older,
being single, and having less education were
each associated with more chronic illnesses.
Using the positive likelihood ratio test criteria,
the only significant contributor to the model
was friendship strain, which was associated
with a greater number of chronic illnesses.
The association between friendship strain and
chronic illnesses was invariant over time, sug-
gesting that the negative effects of friendship
strain at Wave 1 continued to predict chronic
illnesses into older adulthood.
Subjective well-being did not significantly
change over time. Higher levels of educa-
tion were associated with greater subjective
well-being. Using the positive likelihood ratio
test criteria, spousal support, child support,
and friendship support were all associated
with greater subjective well-being. Spousal
and child strain (marginally) were associated
with lower subjective well-being. As in Study
1, family relationships did not contribute to
subjective well-being. Each of these relation-
ships was invariant over time, suggesting that
the benefits of support and the costs of strain

continued to predict subjective well-being into
older adulthood.
Discussion
In Study 2, the effects of support and strain
from different relationship sources were exam-
ined. Only friendship strain predicted more
chronic illnesses over time. The support and
strain of spousal, parent–child, and friendship
relationships predicted subjective well-being.
All of these associations were time invariant
over a 6- and 8-year window, respectively. The
second study addressed many of the limitations
of Study 1 by examining the effects of differ-
ent sources of support on changes in health and
well-being over time. By differentiating fam-
ily relationships into spousal, child, and other
immediate family, greater specificity of these
relationships on health and well-being was dis-
covered.
The results from the second study sug-
gest that family relationships with people other
than spouses and one’
s immediate children
have little influence on an individual’
s health
and well-being in older adulthood. Support
and strain from spouses, children, and friends
were larger predictors of well-being and also
remained so over the course of the study, not
diminishing in influence over time. Friendship
strain was among the only predictors of chronic
illnesses in later life, a point that is examined
in the General Discussion.
Although Study 2 improved on Study 1
considerably, it is not without limitations.
One such limitation is that study participa-
tion was restricted primarily to older adults
(50+ years old). Study 1 focused on a larger
 Relational values, social support, and well-being
11
age range (15–99), which allowed for an
age-by-age comparison of the effect of close
relationships on health and well-being. It could
be that the effects of social relationships on
health accumulate over large stretches of time.
Figures 1–3 provide evidence for this—the
benefits of valuing close relationships are very
small earlier in life and slowly accumulate over
time. Given that participants in Study 2 were
followed up over a short time frame, a longer
examination of the health and well-being ben-
efits of close relationships among older adults
could be warranted.
Another limitation is the way in which
chronic illnesses were indexed. In Study 2,
the eight illnesses were summed, giving equal
weight to each illness. However, different
illnesses likely warrant different weights. For
example, a person with heart failure may
require a larger chronic illness weight than a
person with a mild case of arthritis. However,
there were no data on the severity of each
illness experienced by participants. Therefore,
illnesses could not be weighted based on sever-
ity, but this distinction may have implications,
such that social support and strain may have
different influences on some indicators of
health (e.g., emotional problems) than others
(e.g., strokes). A working hypothesis would be
that positive social relationships would likely
mitigate most of the severity across many dif-
ferent illnesses. Future research can examine
whether support/strain from different sources
affect the onset of different health problems
and illnesses.
General Discussion
In two studies, valuing and receiving sup-
port from different types of relationships were
each uniquely associated with better health
and higher happiness and subjective well-being
across the lifespan. In Study 1, friendships
were particularly beneficial for older adults. In
Study 2, strain from friendships was the only
significant predictor of chronic illnesses over
time. Spousal, child, and friend relationships
were related to greater subjective well-being.
Most notably, familial (nonspousal, nonchild)
relationships did not affect health or subjec-
tive well-being in either study. The current
findings align well with previous research on
the benefits of close relationships (House et al.,
1988); furthermore, the current study extended
this research by examining the relative influ-
ence of different types of close relationships on
health and well-being at different points of the
lifespan.
The
fact
that
positive
spousal
and
parent–child relationships were related to
better health and higher subjective well-being
is consistent with previous research (Carr,
Freedman, Cornman, & Schwarz, 2014; Kim,
Chopik, & Smith, 2014). However, why did
familial relationships have a static (or in some
cases, no) influence on health and well-being
across the lifespan but spousal, parent–child,
and friend relationships become increasingly
important across the lifespan? Unfortunately,
given the limited number of variables in both
studies, it is difficult to test specific mecha-
nisms that might link different relationships to
health and well-being. Insights from several
existing theories and research point to some
possible explanations, especially with respect
to one finding—that friendships exerted such a
strong influence on health and well-being even
after controlling for support and strain from
other relationships. Friendships were very
influential—when friends were the source
of strain, participants reported more chronic
illnesses; when friends were the source of sup-
port, participants were happier. This finding is
consistent with previous research showing that
friendship quality often predicts health more
so than the quality of other relationships (Bear-
man & Moody, 2004; Christakis & Fowler,
2007; Giles et al., 2005). The discussion of the
current studies will focus on the unique aspect
that these relationships—friendships—have
on health and subjective well-being across the
lifespan.
The importance of friendships on health
and well-being across the lifespan
Chronic disease, health behavior, and psycho-
logical well-being have been shown to spread
through social networks over time (Smith &
Christakis, 2008). Although social networks
tend to decrease in size across the lifespan,
individuals tend to shift greater attention and
 12
W. J. Chopik
resources toward maintaining existing relation-
ships that maximize well-being (Carstensen
et al., 1999). Thus, as individuals invest more
in these relationships over time, they are
likely to accumulate the benefits conferred
by these relationships, resulting in greater
health and well-being in older adulthood.
Furthermore, the quality of social networks
primarily involving friends predict mortality
among older adults, while the quality of social
networks with relatives (i.e., family) do not
predict mortality (Giles et al., 2005). Giles
and colleagues (2005) suggest that friendships
may play a larger role in predicting health
and well-being in late life primarily because
interactions with friends stem from choice
and selectivity, and individuals likely maintain
the friendships that maximize well-being;
selectively removing familial relationships
from one’
s life may be considerably harder.
Familial relationships also might decline
more naturally over time, and as a result, indi-
viduals invest more in friendships as a source
of support and well-being. The latter rela-
tionships necessarily involve more effort to
maintain because they are mostly optional,
whereas familial relationships are arguably not
(Roberts & Dunbar, 2011). Due to their selec-
tive nature, some relationships can be shaped
and changed much easier than other types of
relationships. Thus, many of the psychosocial
mechanisms that link close relationships to
health and well-being may operate through the
relationships preserved (or pruned) across the
lifespan (Carstensen, Fung, & Charles, 2003)
rather than obligatory familial relationships,
which exert a smaller influence on well-being
in older adulthood (Lee & Ishii-Kuntz, 1987).
The benefits of friendships on well-being
have received some empirical support, albeit
friendships
are
rarely
explicitly
studied.
Notably, individuals have many more interac-
tions with friends and other “weaker ties” than
with family and other “closer ties” throughout
a day (Sandstrom & Dunn, 2014). Friends are
an ever-present element in peoples’ lives—at
work, school, church, the gym. Having good
friends in these contexts makes individuals
feel less lonely, a greater sense of belonging,
and ultimately happier (Jehn & Shah, 1997;
Riordan & Griffeth, 1995). On days when
individuals interact with friends, they report
greater happiness and more positive affect
(Sandstrom & Dunn, 2014). In fact, people
generally report more positive experiences
with their friends than they do with their
families, particularly in later life (Huxhold,
Miche, & Schüz, 2014; Larson, Mannell, &
Zuzanek, 1986). Larson and colleagues (1986)
suggest that friendships are more closely tied
to well-being because friends often engage
in leisure activities together, often in limited
doses that involve a degree of spontaneity.
Family relationships, on the other hand, are
enjoyable for many people, but they also
implicate more serious, sometimes negative
and monotonous interactions.
How these sources of support and strain pre-
dict health and well-being in different contexts
is an important direction for future research.
For example, among people without roman-
tic partners in old age, emotional support and
assistance from friends are among the most
protective factors against loneliness (Dykstra,
1995). For many older adults, friends may
provide extra support when familial relation-
ships end as they are more likely to as time
passes. Indeed, Walen and Lachman (2000)
suggest that friendship networks may exert
a larger influence on health in late life not
only because they are selective relationships
(Roberts & Dunbar, 2011) but also because
friendships may often be the only relationships
left in an individual’
s life. This may be partic-
ularly true if they have a distant relationship
with their families or have experienced spousal
bereavement (Gupta & Korte, 1994). Often-
times, adults can rely on support from one rela-
tionship (e.g., spousal, parent–child, family)
to buffer against the effects of strain result-
ing from another relationship (e.g., friend-
ships; Walen & Lachman, 2000). However, in
the absence of these other relationships, the
strain experienced in friendships may exert a
larger effect in late life. This can be partic-
ularly toxic given the research demonstrating
that relationship strain is more closely linked
to health than support (Walen & Lachman,
2000). Although the aforementioned points are
speculative, future research can examine the
exact mechanisms underlying the link between
friendship strain and physical health.
 Relational values, social support, and well-being
13
The role of family and friendship support on
health and well-being might also exert different
influences depending on one’
s cultural context.
Friendships are found in some form or another
in nearly all cultures (Cohen, 1966). However,
the importance and function of close relation-
ships change over time differently between cul-
tures (Keller, Edelstein, Schmid, Fang, & Fang,
1998). The benefits of friendships on health
and well-being may also differ on the degree
to which friendships are actually considered
selective, which likely differs across cultures
as well (Beer, 2001). Although cultural vari-
ation was not the main focus of the current
study, how friendship is expressed in different
cultures and whether these differences explain
cultural variation in health and happiness are
exciting directions for future research and can
be examined using data from Study 1 (Keller,
2003; Kumar, Calvo, Avendano, Sivaramakr-
ishnan, & Berkman, 2012).
Conclusion
The current study demonstrated that invest-
ing in close relationships is associated with
better health, happiness, and well-being in
adults across the lifespan. Future longitudinal
studies can examine which (and how) close
relationships exert their influence on health
and well-being and the factors (e.g., cultural,
social, and personal variables) that might atten-
uate these mechanisms. The limitations of the
current studies notwithstanding, contextualiz-
ing the link between close relationships and
health within a lifespan developmental con-
text will hopefully stimulate research for exam-
ining the mechanisms that give rise to the
enhancing effects of close relationships and
how these benefits are conferred and unfold
over time.
