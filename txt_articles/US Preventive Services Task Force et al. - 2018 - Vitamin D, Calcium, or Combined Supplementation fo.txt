Recommendation Statement
US Preventive Services Task Force
IMPORTANCE Because of the aging population, osteoporotic fractures are an increasingly
important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Approximately 2 million
osteoporotic fractures occurred in the United States in 2005, and annual incidence is
projected to increase to more than 3 million fractures by 2025. Within 1 year of experiencing
a hip fracture, many patients are unable to walk independently, more than half require
assistance with activities of daily living, and 20% to 30% of patients will die.
OBJECTIVE To update the 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation
on vitamin D supplementation, with or without calcium, to prevent fractures.
EVIDENCE REVIEW The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on vitamin D, calcium, and combined
supplementation for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling adults
(defined as not living in a nursing home or other institutional care setting). The review
excluded studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to bone
metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking medications known to be
associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-term steroids), or with a previous fracture.
FINDINGS The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of vitamin D,
calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and
premenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily supplementation
with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium has no benefit for the
primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. The
USPSTF found inadequate evidence to estimate the benefits of doses greater than 400 IU of
vitamin D or greater than 1000 mg of calcium to prevent fractures in community-dwelling
postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with
vitamin D and calcium increases the incidence of kidney stones.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is
insufficient to assess the balance of the benefits and harms of vitamin D and calcium
supplementation, alone or combined, for the primary prevention of fractures in
community-dwelling, asymptomatic men and premenopausal women. (I statement) The
USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of the
benefits and harms of daily supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin D
and greater than 1000 mg of calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in
community-dwelling, postmenopausal women. (I statement) The USPSTF recommends
against daily supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of
calcium for the primary prevention of fractures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal
women. (D recommendation) These recommendations do not apply to persons with a history
of osteoporotic fractures, increased risk for falls, or a diagnosis of osteoporosis or
vitamin D deficiency.

 T
he US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes
recommendations about the effectiveness of specific
preventive care services for patients without obvious
related signs or symptoms.
It bases its recommendations on the evidence of both the
benefits and harms of the service and an assessment of the bal-
ance. The USPSTF does not consider the costs of providing a ser-
vice in this assessment.
TheUSPSTFrecognizesthatclinicaldecisionsinvolvemorecon-
siderations than evidence alone. Clinicians should understand the
evidence but individualize decision making to the specific patient

patients are unable to walk independently, more than half require
assistance with activities of daily living,3,4 and 20% to 30% of pa-
tients will die.5
Benefits of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF found inadequate evidence to determine the effects
of vitamin D and calcium supplementation, alone or combined, on
the incidence of fractures in men and premenopausal women. The
USPSTF found adequate evidence that daily supplementation with
400 IU or less of vitamin D combined with 1000 mg or less of cal-
cium has no effect on the incidence of fractures in community-
dwelling, postmenopausal women. The USPSTF found inadequate

tures in community-dwelling, postmenopausal women.
Harms of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF found adequate evidence that supplementation with

USPSTF assessed the magnitude of this harm as small. The USPSTF

Suggestions for Practice Regarding the I Statements
Potential Preventable Burden
Approximately2millionosteoporoticfracturesoccurredintheUnited
States in 2005.2 The health burden of fractures is substantial in the
olderadultpopulation.Twentypercentto30%ofpatientsdiewithin
1yearofahipfracture,withsignificantlyhighermortalityratesinmen
than in women.5 Nearly 40% of persons who experience a fracture
are unable to walk independently at 1 year, and 60% require assis-
tance with at least 1 essential activity of daily living.3,4
Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk
factors for incident osteoporotic fractures.1,6 Ten percent to 15%
of falls result in fractures,6 and nearly all hip fractures are related to
a fall.7 Other risks factors for low bone mass and fractures include
female sex, smoking, use of glucocorticoids, and use of other medi-
cations that impair bone metabolism (eg, aromatase inhibitors).8-11
Most fractures (71%) occur among women,2 and an estimated 74%
of all fractures that occur in women are among those 65 years or
older.6 Although the risk for fractures in premenopausal women

 increases with lower peak bone mass, absolute fracture risk in pre-
menopausal women is very low compared with that in postmeno-
pausal women.12 Although fractures occur more frequently in
women, mortality rates after a hip fracture are significantly higher
in men than in women.2,13
The large Women’
s Health Initiative (WHI) trial (n = 36 282),
which studied daily supplementation with 400 IU of vitamin D3
(cholecalciferol)and1000mgofcalcium,reportednosignificantre-
ductioninanyfractureoutcome14;thus,theUSPSTFconcludedthat
supplementation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or
less of calcium does not prevent fractures. Studies of supplemen-
tation with higher doses of vitamin D and calcium (alone or com-
bined)showedinconsistentresultsandwerefrequentlyunderpow-
ered to detect differences; thus, the USPSTF concluded that the
evidence on supplementation with higher doses of vitamin D and
calcium to prevent fractures is inadequate.
Potential Harms
The WHI trial found a statistically significant increase in the inci-
denceofkidneystonesinwomentakingvitaminDandcalciumcom-
pared with women taking placebo.14 For every 273 women who re-
ceivedsupplementationovera7-yearfollow-upperiod,1womanwas
diagnosed with a urinary tract stone. In addition, a recent study15
of combined vitamin D and calcium supplementation found find-
ings consistent with those from the WHI trial, although the in-
creasewasnotstatisticallysignificant.Anotherrecentstudy16,17found

I statement
The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits
and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poor quality, or conflicting, and the balance of
benefits and harms cannot be determined.

Statement. If the service is offered,
patients should understand the
uncertainty about the balance of benefits
and harms.
USPSTF Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit
Level of Certainty
Description
High
The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative primary care
populations. These studies assess the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes. This conclusion is therefore unlikely to be
strongly affected by the results of future studies.
Moderate
The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate
is constrained by such factors as 
the number, size, or quality of individual studies.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice.
lack of coherence in the chain of evidence.
As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large
enough to alter the conclusion.
The USPSTF defines certainty as “likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benefit of a preventive service is correct.” The net benefit is defined as
benefit minus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary care population. The USPSTF assigns a certainty level based on the nature
of the overall evidence available to assess the net benefit of a preventive service.
Low
The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of
the limited number or size of studies.
important flaws in study design or methods.
inconsistency of findings across individual studies.
gaps in the chain of evidence.
findings not generalizable to routine primary care practice.
lack of information on important health outcomes.
More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes.

number of persons experiencing falls and fractures.19 The USPSTF
nowrecommendsagainstvitaminDsupplementationtopreventfalls
in community-dwelling older adults.18
Current Practice
VitaminDandcalciumsupplementationareoftenrecommendedfor
women, especially postmenopausal women, to prevent fractures,
although actual use is uncertain. Based on 2011-2012 data from the
NationalHealthandNutritionExaminationSurvey,anestimated27%
of men and 35% of women older than 20 years take a vitamin D
supplement, and 26% of men and 33% of women take a calcium
supplement.20Theexactdosageofsupplementationisnotknown.
Other Approaches to Prevention
The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis in women
65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk.21 The
USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to as-
sess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D
deficiency in asymptomatic adults.22
The USPSTF recently updated its recommendation on inter-
ventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults.18 The
USPSTF assessed the effect of vitamin D to prevent falls in older
adults at average and increased risk for falls without vitamin D in-
sufficiencyordeficiency.TheUSPSTFfoundadequateevidencethat
vitaminDsupplementationdoesnotpreventfalls.TheUSPSTFalso
found that exercise can prevent falls in community-dwelling older
adultsatincreasedriskforfalls;multifactorialinterventionsmayalso

Other Considerations
Research Needs and Gaps
Research is needed to determine whether daily supplementation
withdosesgreaterthan400IUofvitaminDandgreaterthan1000
mgofcalciumreducesfractureincidenceinpostmenopausalwomen
and in older men. Prospective studies should assess the potential
benefits of vitamin D and calcium supplementation in premeno-
pausal women on fracture incidence later in life. Studies need to be
adequately powered and should evaluate consistent fracture out-
comes. Studies are also needed to evaluate the effects of vitamin D
supplementation on diverse populations. Because white women
have the highest risk for osteoporotic fractures, most fracture pre-
ventionstudieshavebeenconductedinthispopulation,anditisdif-
ficult to extrapolate results to nonwhite populations. In addition,

Recommendations

go to https://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org.   
Low bone mass, older age, and history of falls are major risk factors for incident osteoporotic fractures. Other risk factors for
low bone mass and fractures include female sex, smoking, use of glucocorticoids, and use of other medications that impair
bone metabolism (eg, aromatase inhibitors). Absolute fracture risk is very low in premenopausal women compared with
postmenopausal women.
The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low
doses provides no benefit. Evidence on the effect of supplementation on fractures at higher doses is conflicting, with some studies
showing a reduction in certain fractures at higher doses and others showing no reduction or even an increase. More studies are
needed to more clearly determine if supplementation with vitamin D, calcium, or both consistently prevents fractures. If future
evidence shows a benefit, the magnitude of that benefit will need to be weighed against the magnitude of harms caused by
supplementation (kidney stones).
The USPSTF recommends against vitamin D supplementation to prevent falls in community-dwelling adults 65 years or older.
The USPSTF recommends exercise interventions to prevent falls in community-dwelling older adults at increased risk for falls;
multifactorial interventions may also be effective in some persons as well. The USPSTF recommends screening for osteoporosis
in women 65 years or older and in younger women at increased risk. The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient
to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for vitamin D deficiency in asymptomatic adults.

Discussion
Burden of Disease
Because of the aging population, osteoporotic fractures are an in-
creasingly important cause of morbidity and mortality in the United
States.Approximately2millionosteoporoticfracturesoccurredinthe
United States in 2005, and annual incidence is projected to increase
to more than 3 million fractures by 2025.2 Nearly half of all women
older than 50 years will experience an osteoporotic fracture during
theirlifetime.23Fracturesareassociatedwithchronicpain,disability,
and decreased quality of life. Hip fractures significantly increase
morbidity and mortality. From 2004-2014, hip fractures alone ac-
countedforapproximately300 000hospitalizationsannuallyinthe
United States.24 During the first 3 months after a hip fracture, a pa-
tient’
s mortality risk is 5 to 8 times that of a similarly aged person liv-
inginthecommunitywithoutafracture.25Nearly20%ofpatientswith
hip fracture subsequently receive care in a long-term care facility.23
Scope of Review
TheUSPSTFcommissionedasystematicevidencereviewonvitaminD,
calcium,andcombinedsupplementationfortheprimaryprevention
of fractures in community-dwelling adults.1,26 The review excluded
studies conducted in populations with a known disorder related to
bone metabolism (eg, osteoporosis or vitamin D deficiency), taking
medications known to be associated with osteoporosis (eg, long-
term steroids), or with a previous fracture. The review also excluded
studies that recruited participants based on a history of falls or high
riskforfalls,becausethesepopulationsarecoveredinaseparateevi-
dencereview,andstudiesconductedininstitutionalcaresettings,such
as long-term care facilities, because persons living in these settings
are often at a very increased risk for falls. Evaluating evidence on the
use of vitamin D to treat vitamin D deficiency or to treat osteoporo-
sis is beyond the scope of this review.
Effectiveness of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF reviewed evidence from 8 randomized clinical trials
(RCTs) on vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation for
the primary prevention of fractures; 4 trials evaluated vitamin D
supplementation (n = 10 606), 2 trials evaluated calcium supple-
mentation (n = 339), and 2 trials evaluated combined vitamin D
and calcium supplementation (n = 36 727).1,26 Four studies in-
cluded men (representing data from 5900 men) and 4 studies
were conducted exclusively in women (total of 41 772 women
across all 8 studies). The mean age of study participants ranged
from 53 to 80 years. In the 5 studies reporting race/ethnicity, 83%
to 100% of participants were white; the remaining 3 studies did
not report this information. Four of the studies were conducted in
the United States, while 4 were conducted in the United Kingdom,
Finland, the Netherlands, and New Zealand. Fracture outcomes var-
iedandincludedtotalfractures,hipfractures,majorosteoporoticfrac-
tures, nonvertebral fractures, vertebral fractures (clinical, morpho-
metric,orboth),upperextremityfractures,lowerarm/wristfractures,
and peripheral fractures.
Four studies reported on the effect of vitamin D supplementa-
tion on fracture prevention.1 Two studies evaluated daily doses of
400 IU or less (n = 2810)27,28 and did not find any significant dif-
ferenceinanyfractureoutcome.Theprimaryaimofthelargerstudy
(n = 2578)28 was reduction in incidence of hip and other osteopo-
rotic fractures. Two studies evaluated higher doses of vitamin D: a
loading dose of 200 000 IU followed by 100 000 IU monthly
(n = 5110)16,17and100 000IUevery4months(n = 2686).29These

−1.73%to0.23%];age-adjustedRR,0.63[95%CI,0.35to1.14]).1,29
Two studies reported on the effect of calcium supplementation
on fracture prevention (n = 339).1,30,31 The studies evaluated daily
dosesof1200and1600mg.Neitherstudyfoundasignificantdiffer-
ence in fracture outcomes with calcium supplementation, although
neither study was adequately powered to detect differences.

cebo,wasadequatelypoweredtodetecttheeffectofcombinedvi-

difference in total fractures (ARD, −0.35% [95% CI, −1.02% to
0.31%]; HR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.02]) or clinical vertebral frac-
tures (ARD, −0.09% [95% CI, −0.30% to 0.12%]; HR, 0.90 [95%

Potential Harms of Preventive Medication
The USPSTF evaluated evidence from 9 RCTs on the harms of vita-
min D, calcium, or combined supplementation.1,26 Four studies re-
ported on harms of vitamin D supplementation alone (n = 10 599)

Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit
TheUSPSTFfoundinadequateevidencetoestimatethebenefitsof
vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to prevent frac-
turesincommunity-dwellingmenandpremenopausalwomen.The
USPSTFconcludesthatthereisinsufficientevidencetoestimatethe
net benefit of vitamin D, calcium, or combined supplementation to
prevent fractures in community-dwelling men and premenopausal
women. Because of the lack of effect on fracture incidence and the
increased incidence of kidney stones in intervention groups, the
USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that daily supplemen-
tation with 400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of cal-
cium has no net benefit for the primary prevention of fractures in
community-dwelling,postmenopausalwomen.Althoughwomenen-
rolled in the WHI trial were predominately white, the lower risk for
fractures in nonwhite women makes it very unlikely that a benefit
would exist in this population. The USPSTF found inadequate evi-
denceoncalciumsupplementationalone,aswellasonsupplemen-
tationwithdosesgreaterthan400IUofvitaminDandgreaterthan
1000 mg of calcium in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF con-
cludes that there is insufficient evidence to estimate the net ben-
efit of supplementation with doses greater than 400 IU of vitamin
Dandgreaterthan1000mgofcalciuminpostmenopausalwomen.
How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding?
Calciumcontributestobonegrowth,andvitaminDhelpsbonesab-
sorb calcium. Normal, healthy bones turn over calcium constantly,
replacingcalciumlosswithnewcalcium.Thehumanbodyhas2main
sourcesofvitaminD.Cholecalciferol(vitaminD3),thelargersource
of vitamin D, is synthesized in the skin by UVB rays from the sun.
Vitamin D3 is converted to its active form through enzymatic pro-
cesses in the liver and kidney. Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is con-
sumed in the diet and can be found naturally in a few foods, such as
mushrooms and egg yolks, but is more commonly consumed as a
supplement or in fortified foods and beverages, such as milk, yo-
gurt,andorangejuice.35Mostcellscontainspecificreceptorsforthe
active form of vitamin D. Stimulation of skeletal muscle receptors
promotesproteinsynthesis,andvitaminDhasabeneficialeffecton
muscle strength and balance. Vitamin D controls calcium absorp-
tion in the small intestines, interacts with parathyroid hormone to
help maintain calcium homeostasis between the blood and bones,
and is essential for bone growth and maintaining bone density. Ob-
taining insufficient amounts of vitamin D through diet or sun expo-
sure can lead to inadequate levels of the hormone calcitriol (the ac-
tiveformofvitaminD),whichinturncanleadtoimpairedabsorption
of dietary calcium. Consequently, the body uses calcium from skel-
etal stores, which can weaken existing bones.
The current recommendation against supplementation with
400 IU or less of vitamin D and 1000 mg or less of calcium for the
primary prevention of fractures is primarily based on the finding of
no benefit with supplementation at lower doses. More evidence is
neededtodeterminewhetherhigherdosesofsupplementationmay
bemoreeffectiveatpreventingfractures.Althoughtheriskforkid-
ney stones could theoretically increase at higher doses of supple-
mentation,theoveralldeterminationofnetbenefitornetharmwill
depend on whether a benefit in fracture prevention is also found at
higher doses and, if so, what the magnitude of that benefit is.

VitaminD,Calcium,orCom-
bined Supplementation for the Primary Prevention of Fractures in
Community-Dwelling Adults.”Some comments expressed concern
that the recommendation against supplementation with vitamin D
would be misinterpreted by persons with known osteoporosis or vi-
tamin D deficiency. Persons with known osteoporosis or vitamin D
deficiencywereexcludedfromtheevidencereview,andthusareex-
cluded from the recommendation statement, as described in the
“Summary of Recommendations and Evidence”and “Patient Popu-
lationUnderConsideration”sections.Othercommentsrequestedclari-
fication of the role of vitamin D in persons with known osteoporosis
or vitamin D deficiency. This is beyond the scope of the recommen-
dationandhasbeenclarifiedinthe“ScopeofReview”section.Some
comments also expressed confusion over why a finding of “insuffi-
cientevidence”wasissuedforsupplementationathigherdosesifthe
USPSTF recommends against supplementation at lower doses.
The recommendation against supplementation at lower doses was
based on an overall assessment that supplementation at low doses
provides no benefit. Evidence on the effect of supplementation on
fractures at higher doses is conflicting, with some studies showing a
reductionincertainfracturetypesathigherdoses,andothersshow-
ingnoreductionorevenanincrease.Morestudiesareneededtomore
clearlydetermineifsupplementationwithvitaminD,calcium,orboth
consistently prevents fractures. If future evidence shows a benefit,
themagnitudeofthatbenefitwillneedtobeweighedagainstthemag-
nitude of harms caused by supplementation (kidney stones).
Update of Previous USPSTF Recommendation
This recommendation is consistent with the 2013 USPSTF recom-
mendation on vitamin D supplementation, with or without cal-
cium, to prevent fractures.36 The USPSTF added evidence on cal-
cium supplementation alone to the evidence review for this
recommendation;however,theevidencewastoolimitedtobemake
aseparaterecommendationaboutcalciumsupplementationalone.
Evidence from more recent studies confirms that the evidence on
fracturepreventionwithdosesofvitaminDgreaterthan400IUdaily
is inconsistent and inadequate, because of underpowering of stud-
ies at higher doses. Newer evidence confirms an increased risk for
kidney stones with combined vitamin D and calcium supplementa-
tionandalsosuggestsnoincreasedincidenceofcardiovasculardis-
ease with vitamin D supplementation.
