ACTION: Final rule. 
SUMMARY: This final rule implements 
the provisions of the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 
(ARRA) (Pub. L. 111–5) that provide 
incentive payments to eligible 
professionals (EPs), eligible hospitals 
and critical access hospitals (CAHs) 
participating in Medicare and Medicaid 
programs that adopt and successfully 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
electronic health record (EHR) 
technology. This final rule specifies— 
the initial criteria EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs must meet in order to qualify 
for an incentive payment; calculation of 
the incentive payment amounts; 
payment adjustments under Medicare 
for covered professional services and 
inpatient hospital services provided by 
EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs failing 
to demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology; and other 
program participation requirements. 
Also, the Office of the National 
Coordinator for Health Information 
Technology (ONC) will be issuing a 
closely related final rule that specifies 
the Secretary’s adoption of an initial set 
of standards, implementation, 
specifications, and certification criteria 
for electronic health records. ONC has 
also issued a separate final rule on the 
establishment of certification programs 
for health information technology. 
DATES: Effective Date: These regulations 
are effective on September 27, 2010.

 44316 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
2009. Title IV of Division B of ARRA 
amends Titles XVIII and XIX of the 
Social Security Act (the Act) by 
establishing incentive payments to 
eligible professionals (EPs), eligible 
hospitals, and critical access hospitals 
(CAHs), and Medicare Advantage 
Organizations to promote the adoption 
and meaningful use of interoperable 
health information technology (HIT) and 
qualified electronic health records 
(EHRs). These provisions, together with 
Title XIII of Division A of ARRA, may 
be cited as the ‘‘Health Information 
Technology for Economic and Clinical 
Health Act’’ or the ‘‘HITECH Act.’’ These 
incentive payments are part of a broader 
effort under the HITECH Act to 
accelerate the adoption of HIT and 
utilization of qualified EHRs. 
On January 13, 2010 we published a 
proposed rule (75 FR 1844), entitled 
‘‘Medicare and Medicaid Programs; 
Electronic Health Record Incentive 
Program’’ to implement the provisions of 
ARRA that provide incentive payments 
to EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs 
participating in Medicare and Medicaid 
programs that adopt and successfully 
demonstrate meaningful use of ‘‘certified 
EHR technology,’’ and incentive 
payments to certain Medicare 
Advantage Organizations for their 
affiliated EPs and eligible hospitals that 
meaningfully use certified EHR 
technology. Through this final rule, we 
are developing the incentive programs 
which are outlined in Division B, Title 
IV of the HITECH Act. This final rule 
sets forth the definition of ‘‘meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology.’’ 
Section 13101 of the HITECH Act 
adds a new section 3000 to the Public 
Health Service Act (PHSA), which 
defines ‘‘certified EHR technology’’ as a 
qualified EHR that has been properly 
certified as meeting standards adopted 
under section 3004 of the PHSA. CMS 
and ONC have been working closely to 
ensure that the definition of meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology and the 
standards for certified EHR technology 
are coordinated. In the interim final rule 
published on January 13, 2010 (75 FR 
2014) entitled ‘‘Health Information 
Technology: Initial Set of Standards, 
Implementation Specifications, and 
Certification Criteria for Electronic 
Health Record Technology,’’ ONC 
defined the term ‘‘certified EHR 
technology,’’ identified the initial set of 
standards and implementation 
specifications that such EHR technology 
would need to support the achievement 
of the proposed meaningful use Stage 1, 
as well as the certification criteria that 
will be used to certify EHR technology. 
ONC is also issuing a final rule on the 
standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 
Register. 
In a related proposed rule published 
on March 10, 2010, (75 FR 11328) 
entitled ‘‘Proposed Establishment of 
Certification Programs for Health 
Information Technology’’ ONC proposed 
the establishment of two certification 
programs for purpose of testing and 
certifying health information 
technology. In the June 24, 2010 Federal 
Register (75 FR 36157), ONC published 
a final rule to establish a temporary 
certification program whereby the 
National Coordinator would authorize 
organizations to test and certify 
complete EHRs and EHR Modules, and 
plans to issue a separate final rule to 
establish a permanent certification 
program to replace the temporary 
certification program. Specifically, this 
final rule will ensure that the definition 
of meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology does not require EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs to perform 
functions for which standards have not 
been recognized or established. 
Similarly, the functionality of certified 
EHR technology should enable and 
advance the definition of meaningful 
use. 
We urge those interested in this final 
rule to also review the ONC interim 
final rule on standards and 
implementation specifications for 
certified EHR technology and the related 
final rule as well as the final rule on the 
establishment of a temporary 
certification program. Readers may also

Department of Health and Human 
Services (HHS) to advance HIT 
initiatives. 
B. Statutory Basis for the Medicare & 
Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs 
Section 4101(a) of the HITECH Act 
adds a new subsection (o) to section 
1848 of the Act. Section 1848(o) of the 
Act establishes incentive payments for 
demonstration of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology by EPs 
participating in the original Medicare 
program (hereinafter referred to as the 
Medicare Fee-for-Service (FFS) 
program) beginning in calendar year 
(CY) 2011. Section 4101(b) of the 
HITECH Act also adds a new paragraph 
(7) to section 1848(a) of the Act. Section 
1848(a)(7) of the Act provides that 
beginning in CY 2015, EPs who do not 
demonstrate that they are meaningful 
users of certified EHR technology will 
receive an adjustment to their fee 
schedule for their professional services 
of 99 percent for 2015 (or, in the case 
of an eligible professional who was 
subject to the application of the 
payment adjustment under section 
1848(a)(5) of the Act, 98 percent for 
2014), 98 percent for 2016, and 97 
percent for 2017 and each subsequent 
year. Section 4101(c) of the HITECH Act 
adds a new subsection (l) to section 
1853 of the Act to provide incentive 
payments to certain Medicare 
Advantage (MA) organizations for their 
affiliated EPs who meaningfully use 
certified EHR technology and meet 
certain other requirements, and requires 
a downward adjustment to Medicare 
payments to certain MA organizations 
for professional services provided by 
any of their affiliated EPs who are not 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology, beginning in 2015. Section 
1853(l) of the Act also requires us to 
establish a process that ensures that 
there are no duplicate payments made 
to MA organizations under section 
1853(l) of the Act and to their affiliated 
EPs under the FFS EHR incentive 
program established under section 
1848(o)(1)(A) of the Act. 
Section 4102(a) of the HITECH Act 
adds a new subsection (n) to section 
1886 of the Act. Section 1886(n) of the 
Act establishes incentives payments for 
demonstration of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology by subsection 
(d) hospitals, as defined under section 
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, participating in 
the Medicare FFS program beginning in 
Federal fiscal year (FFY) 2011. Section 
4102(b)(1) of the HITECH Act amends 
section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act to 
provide that, beginning in FY 2015, 
subsection (d) hospitals that are not 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology will receive a reduced 
annual payment update for their 
inpatient hospital services. Section 
4102(a)(2) of the HITECH Act amends 
section 1814(l) of the Act to provide an 
incentive payment to critical access 
hospitals (CAHs) who meaningfully use 
certified EHR technology based on the 
hospitals’ reasonable costs for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology 
beginning in FY 2011. In addition, 
section 4102(b)(2) of the HITECH Act 
amends section 1814(l) of the Act to 
provide for a downward payment 
adjustment for hospital services 
provided by CAHs that are not 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology for cost reporting periods 
beginning in FY 2015. Section 4102(c) 
of the HITECH Act adds a new 
subsection (m) to section 1853 of the 
Act to provide incentive payments to 
qualifying MA organizations for certain 
affiliated hospitals that meaningfully

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
use certified EHR technology to make a 
downward adjustment to payments to 
certain MA organizations for inpatient 
hospital services provided by its 
affiliated hospitals that are not 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology beginning in FY 2015. 
Section 1853(m) of the Act also requires 
us to establish a process that ensures 
that there are no duplicate payments 
made to MA organizations under section 
1853(m) of the Act and to their affiliated 
hospitals under the FFS EHR incentive 
program established under section 
1886(n) of the Act. 
Section 4103 of the HITECH Act 
provides for implementation funding for 
the EHR incentives program under 
Medicare. 
Section 4201 of the HITECH Act 
amends section 1903 of the Act to 
provide 100 percent Federal financial 
participation (FFP) to States for 
incentive payments to certain eligible 
providers participating in the Medicaid 
program to purchase, implement, 
operate (including support services and 
training for staff) and meaningfully use 
certified EHR technology and 90 percent 
FFP for State administrative expenses 
related to the program outlined in 
1903(t) of the Act. Section 4201(a)(2) of 
the HITECH Act adds a new subsection 
(t) to section 1903 of the Act to establish 
a program with input from the States to 
provide incentives for the adoption and 
subsequent meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology for providers 
participating in the Medicaid program. 
II. Provisions of the Proposed Rule and 
Analysis of and Responses to Public 
Comments 
We proposed to add a new part 495 
to title 42 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations to implement the provisions 
of Title IV of Division B of ARRA 
providing for incentive payments to 
EPs, eligible hospitals, CAHs and 
certain Medicare Advantage 
organizations for the adoption and 
demonstration of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology under the 
Medicare program or the Medicaid 
program. 
The HITECH Act creates incentives 
under the Medicare Fee-for-Service 
(FFS), Medicare Advantage (MA), and 
Medicaid programs for EPs, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs to adopt and 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology, and payment 
adjustments under the Medicare FFS 
and MA programs for EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs who fail to adopt 
and demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. The three 
incentive programs contain many 
common elements and certain 
provisions of the HITECH Act encourage 
avoiding duplication of payments, 
reporting, and other requirements, 
particularly in the area of demonstration 
of meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. Eligible hospitals and CAHs 
may participate in both the Medicare 
program and the Medicaid program, 
assuming they meet each program’s 
eligibility requirements, which vary 
across the two programs. In certain 
cases, the HITECH Act has used nearly 
identical or identical language in 
defining terms that are used in the 
Medicare FFS, MA, and Medicaid 
programs, including such terms as 
‘‘hospital-based EPs’’ and ‘‘certified EHR 
technology.’’ For these reasons, we seek 
to create as much commonality between 
the three programs as possible and have 
structured this final rule, as we did the 
proposed rule, based on the premise by 
beginning with those provisions that cut 
across the three programs before moving 
on to discuss the provisions specific to 
Medicare FFS, MA and Medicaid. 
A. Definitions Across the Medicare FFS, 
MA, and Medicaid Programs 
Title IV, Division B of ARRA 
establishes incentive payments under 
the Medicare and Medicaid programs 
for certain professionals and hospitals 
that meaningfully use certified EHR 
technology, and for certain MA 
organizations whose affiliated EPs and 
hospitals meaningfully use certified 
EHR technology. We refer to the 
incentive payments made under the 
original Medicare program to EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs as the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program, 
the incentive payments made to 
qualifying MA organizations as the MA 
EHR incentive program, and the 
incentive payments made under 
Medicaid to eligible professionals and 
eligible hospitals as the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. When referring to 
the Medicare EHR incentive program, 
we are generally referring to both the 
Medicare FFS EHR and the MA EHR 
incentive programs. 
1. Definitions 
Sections 4101, 4102, and 4201 of the 
HITECH Act use many identical or 
similar terms. In this section of the 
preamble, we discuss terms for which 
we are finalizing uniform definitions for 
the Medicare FFS, MA, and Medicaid 
EHR incentive programs. These 
definitions are set forth in part 495 
subpart A of the regulations. For 
definitions specific to an individual 
program, the definition is set forth and 
discussed in the applicable EHR 
incentive program section. 
The incentive payments are available 
to EPs which are non-hospital-based 
physicians, as defined in section 1861(r) 
of the Act, who either receive 
reimbursement for services under the 
Medicare FFS program or have an 
employment or contractual relationship 
with a qualifying MA organization 
meeting the criteria under section 
1853(l)(2) of the Act; or healthcare 
professionals meeting the definition of 
‘‘eligible professional’’ under section 
1903(t)(3)(B) of the Act as well as the 
patient-volume and non-hospital-based 
criteria of section 1903(t)(2)(A) of the 
Act and eligible hospitals which are 
subsection (d) hospitals as defined 
under subsection 1886(d)(1)(B) of the 
Act that either receive reimbursement 
for services under the Medicare FFS 
program or are affiliated with a 
qualifying MA organization as described 
in section 1853(m)(2) of the Act; critical 
access hospitals (CAHs); or acute care or 
children’s hospitals described under 
section 1903(t)(2)(B) of the Act. 
a. Certified Electronic Health Record 
(EHR) Technology 
Under all three EHR incentive 
programs, EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs must utilize ‘‘certified EHR 
technology’’ if they are to be considered 
eligible for the incentive payments. In 
the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program this requirement for EPs is 
found in section 1848(o)(2)(A)(i) of the 
Act, and for eligible hospitals and CAHs 
in section 1886(n)(3)(A)(i) of the Act. In 
the MA EHR incentive program this 
requirement for EPs is found in section 
1853(l)(1) of the Act, and for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs, in section 
1853(m)(1) of the Act. In the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program this requirement 
for EPs and Medicaid eligible hospitals 
is found throughout section 1903(t) of 
the Act, including in section 
1903(t)(6)(C) of the Act. Certified EHR 
technology is a critical component of 
the EHR incentive programs, and the 
Secretary has charged ONC, under the 
authority given to her in the HITECH 
Act, with developing the criteria and 
mechanisms for certification of EHR 
technology. Therefore, we finalize our 
proposal to use the definition of 
certified EHR technology adopted by 
ONC. ONC issued an interim final rule 
with comment for the standards and 
certification criteria for certified EHR 
technology at the same time our 
proposed rule was issued. After 
reviewing the comments they received 
and to address changes made in this 
final rule, ONC will be issuing a final 
rule in conjunction with this final rule. 
When we refer to the ONC final rule, we 
are referring to this final rule titled

srobinson on DSKHWCL6B1PROD with RULES2
 44318 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
‘‘Health Information Technology: Initial 
Set of Standards, Implementation 
Specifications, and Certification Criteria 
for Electronic Health Record 
Technology. When we refer to the ONC 
IFR, we are referring to the interim final 
rule with comment period published in 
the Federal Register on January 13, 
2010. 
Comment: Several commenters asked 
for clarification on the definition of 
certified EHR technology. Currently, 
hospitals utilize multiple systems to 
operate electronically. For example, 
some electronic operating systems feed 
EHR data and some systems pull EHR 
data. Data from the two systems are then 
extracted and manipulated to create a 
quality measure calculation. The 
commenters’ inquired as to how these 
systems can continue to be utilized even 
though, independently, these systems 
will not meet all certification standards. 
Some commenters expressed concern 
the ONC IFR did not include generation 
of the data needed to demonstrate 
meaningful use as a certification 
requirement and that certified EHR 
technology requirements should also 
include compliance with HIPAA 
standards as well as all relevant state 
statutes for the state or states where it 
is installed. Commenters recommended 
various approaches to defining certified 
technology especially in the early stages 
of the program. Some suggestions 
included, grandfathering existing 
systems for a period of three years as 
long as the provider could meet specific 
meaningful use objectives while 
requiring all upgrades to existing 
systems to be certified, allowing all EHR 
products certified by the Certification 
Commission for Health Information 
Technology (CCHIT) at the criteria 
established for 2008 or later be deemed 
as meeting Stage 1 certification 
requirements or alternatively CMS 
provide a process that can verify 
compliance of required features at no 
cost to providers or vendors as is done 
now with Enterprise Data Interchange 
(EDI) claims processing. Some 
commenters also offered other thoughts 
on potential unintended consequences 
of defining the EHR certification 
software process to include certifying 
agencies that charge for the process. The 
commenters believed this could result 
in continued new and revised 
requirements to justify the certifying 
entities’ existence and increase its 
revenue. 
Response: We have referred those 
comments to ONC who addresses them 
in their final rule. 
We are adopting the ONC definition 
of certified EHR technology at 45 CFR 
170.102 in this final rule. 
b. Qualified Electronic Health Record 
In order for an EHR technology to be 
eligible for certification, it must first 
meet the definition of a Qualified 
Electronic Health Record. This term was 
defined by ONC in its in its IFR and 
finalized by ONC in their final rule, and 
we are finalizing our proposal to use the 
definition of qualified electronic health 
record adopted by ONC in their final 
rule to be published concurrently with 
this rule. 
Comment: We received a few 
comments on the definition of qualified 
EHR technology. Commenters expressed 
concerns regarding perceived gaps in 
defining an EHR as qualified such as a 
lack of the requirement for a narrative 
text for physicians (also known as 
progress note). Another comment 
requested further clarification regarding 
the requirement for a qualified EHR to 
‘‘capture and query information relevant 
to health care quality’’ and ‘‘exchange 
electronic health information with and 
integrate such information from other 
sources.’’ For example, some might 
believe that these requirements apply 
strictly to information contained within 
the EHR or closed proprietary hospital 
systems and not to information that 
would have to be obtained from outside 
the four walls of the practice or the 
extended (but closed) system. 
Response: We have referred those 
comments to ONC who addresses them 
in their final rule. 
We are adopting the ONC definition 
of Qualified Electronic Health Record at 
45 CFR 170.102. 
c. Payment Year 
As discussed in the proposed rule, 
under section 1848(o)(1)(A)(i) of the Act 
the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
payment is available to EPs for a 
‘‘payment year.’’ Section 1848(o)(1)(E) of 
the Act defines the term ‘‘payment year’’ 
as a year beginning with 2011. While 
the Act does not use the term, ‘‘payment 
year,’’ for the Medicaid EHR incentive 
program, it does use the term ‘‘year of 
payment’’ throughout section 1903(t) of 
the Act, for example, at sections 
1903(t)(3)(C), 1903(t)(4)(A), and 
1903(t)(6)(C) of the Act. For all EPs in 
the Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
incentive programs, we are proposing a 
common definition for both ‘‘payment 
year’’ and ‘‘year of payment,’’ as ‘‘any 
calendar year beginning with 2011’’ at 
§ 495.4. In the proposed rule, we 
explained that this definition, which is 
consistent with the statutory definition 
of ‘‘payment year’’ under Medicare FFS, 
would simplify the EHR incentive 
programs for EPs. As discussed later in 
this preamble, EPs will have the 
opportunity to participate in either the 
Medicare or Medicaid incentive 
programs, and once an EP has selected 
a program, they are permitted to make 
a one-time switch from one program to 
the other. A common definition will 
allow EPs to more easily understand 
both incentive programs, and inform 
their decisions regarding participation 
in either program. 
Under section 1886(n)(1) of the Act, 
the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
payment is available to eligible 
hospitals and CAHs for a ‘‘payment 
year.’’ Section 1886(n)(2)(G) of the Act 
defines the term ‘‘payment year’’ as a 
fiscal year beginning in 2011. As 
hospitals are paid based on the 12- 
month Federal fiscal year, we interpret 
the reference to a ‘‘fiscal year’’ means the 
fiscal year beginning on October 1 of the 
prior calendar year and extending to 
September 30 of the relevant year. 
Again, for the Medicaid EHR incentive 
program, the HITECH Act uses the term, 
‘‘year of payment’’ (see section 
1903(t)(5)(D)(ii) of the Act), rather than 
‘‘payment year.’’ For the same reasons 
expressed in the proposed rule and 
summarized above for proposing a 
common definition of ‘‘payment year’’ 
for EPs, and because hospitals will have 
the opportunity to simultaneously 
participate in both the Medicare and 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs, we 
propose a common definition of 
‘‘payment year’’ and ‘‘year of payment’’ 
for both programs. 
For purposes of the incentive 
payments made to eligible hospitals and 
CAHs under the Medicare FFS, MA and 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs, we 
proposed to define payment year and 
year of payment at § 495.4, consistent 
with the statutory definition, as ‘‘any 
fiscal year beginning with 2011.’’ 
Comment: A commenter asked CMS 
to identify the first possible payment 
year for EPs, and hospitals and CAHs. 
Response: The first payment year for 
EPs is any calendar year (CY) beginning 
with CY 2011 and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs is any fiscal year (FY) 
beginning with 2011. 
Comment: The majority of 
commenters favored our definition of 
‘‘payment year’’ based on the different 
existing fiscal periods for eligible 
professionals and hospitals. Additional 
support was received from some 
commenters whom explained that they 
participated in performance-based 
initiatives, which define a payment year 
the same as the proposed rule. 
Response: After consideration of the 
public comments received, we are 
adopting our proposed definition of 
‘‘payment year’’ in the Medicare and

srobinson on DSKHWCL6B1PROD with RULES2
 44319 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs as 
described above. 
Comment: The majority of comments 
received regarding the definition of a 
payment year asked whether payment 
years must be consecutive for an EP or 
eligible hospital to receive all years of 
incentive payments. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
defined the second, third, fourth, fifth, 
and sixth payment year, respectively, to 
mean ‘‘the second, third, fourth, fifth, 
and sixth calendar or Federal fiscal year, 
respectively, for which an EP or eligible 
hospital receives an incentive payment.’’ 
However, section 1848(o)(1)(E) of Act 
defines the second through fifth 
payment years for an EP as each 
successive year immediately following 
the first payment year for such 
professional for the Medicare FFS and 
MA EHR incentive programs. Similarly, 
section 1886(n)(2)(G)(ii) of the Act 
defines the second through fourth 
payment years for an eligible hospital or 
CAH as requiring the years to be 
‘‘successive’’ and ‘‘immediately 
following’’ the prior year. This 
requirement, that each payment year 
‘‘immediately follow’’ the prior year, 
means that every year subsequent to the 
first payment year is a payment year 
regardless of whether an incentive 
payment is received by the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH. For example, if a 
Medicare EP receives an incentive in CY 
2011, but does not successfully 
demonstrate meaningful use or 
otherwise fails to qualify for the 
incentive in CY 2012, CY 2012 still 
counts as one of the EP’s five payment 
years and they would only be able to 
receive an incentive under the Medicare 
EHR incentive program for three more 
years as CY 2013 would be there third 
payment year. In this example, the 
maximum incentive payment that 
would apply for this Medicare EP not 
practicing predominately in a health 
professional shortage area (HPSA) 
would be $18,000 in 2011, and $8,000 
in 2013 as outlined in section 
1848(o)(1)(B) of the Act. The EP would 
have qualified for a maximum incentive 
payment of $12,000 in 2012, but did not 
qualify as a meaningful user for this 
year. No incentives may be made under 
the Medicare EHR incentive program 
after 2016. 
The same rule, however, does not 
apply to the Medicaid EHR incentive 
program. For that program, payments 
may generally be non-consecutive. If an 
EP or eligible hospital does not receive 
an incentive payment for a given CY or 
FY then that year would not constitute 
a payment year. For example, if a 
Medicaid EP receives incentives in CY 
2011 and CY 2012, but fails to qualify 
for an incentive in CY 2013, they would 
still be eligible to receive incentives for 
an additional four payment years. For 
hospitals, however, starting with FY 
2017 payments must be consecutive. 
This rule is required by section 
1903(t)(5)(D) of the Act, which states 
that after 2016, no Medicaid incentive 
payment may be made to an eligible 
hospital unless ‘‘the provider has been 
provided payment * * * for the 
previous year.’’ As a result, Medicaid 
eligible hospitals must receive an 
incentive in FY 2016 to receive an 
incentive in FY 2017 and later years. 
Starting in FY 2016, incentive payments 
must be made every year in order to 
continue participation in the program. 
In no case may any Medicaid EP or 
eligible hospital receive an incentive 
after 2021. We have revised our 
regulations at § 495.4 to incorporate 
these statutory requirements. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested that CMS clarify the impact 
on EPs when they change practices in 
the middle of the incentive payment 
program; in other words, if an EP leaves 
a practice in year two of the incentive 
payment program and goes to another 
practice, does that EP forfeit the ability 
to continue collecting incentive 
payments for years 3 through 5? 
Response: A qualifying EP that leaves 
one practice for another may still be 
eligible to receive subsequent incentive 
payments if the EP is a meaningful EHR 
user in the new practice. The incentive 
payment is tied to the individual EP, 
and not to his or her place of practice. 
d. First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, 
and Sixth Payment Year 
In accordance with sections 
1848(o)(1)(A)(ii), 1886(n)(2)(E), 
1814(l)(3)(A), 1903(t)(4)(B), and 
1903(t)(5)(A) of the Act, for EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs that qualify for 
EHR incentive payments in a payment 
year, the amount of the payment will 
depend in part on whether the EP or 
hospital previously received an 
incentive payment and, if so (for the 
Medicare EHR incentive program) when 
the EP or hospital received his or her 
first payment. We proposed to define 
the first payment year to mean the first 
CY or Federal fiscal year (FY) for which 
an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH receives 
an incentive payment. Likewise, we 
proposed to define the second, third, 
fourth, fifth, and sixth payment year, 
respectively, to mean the second, third, 
fourth, fifth, and sixth CY or FY, 
respectively, for which an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH receives an incentive 
payment. 
Comment: As stated above, many 
commenters requested clarification on 
non-consecutive payment. 
Response: This comment is addressed 
above. 
Comment: A commenter requested 
CMS to clarify the consequences for a 
hospital that originally qualified and 
received incentive payments the first 
year, but in a subsequent year failed to 
qualify as a meaningful user of certified 
EHR technology. 
Response: Meaningful use will be 
assessed on a year-by-year basis as we 
establish different Stages of meaningful 
use criteria for different years. If an EP 
or an eligible hospital including a CAH 
has failed to demonstrate meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology for a 
certain payment year, the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH will not be qualified 
for incentive payments for that payment 
year. However, upon successful 
demonstration as a meaningful EHR 
user in subsequent years, an EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH may be eligible to 
receive an incentive payment. As 
discussed above, however, for the 
Medicare program, the failure of the 
eligible hospital or CAH to demonstrate 
meaningful use in the subsequent year, 
will affect the total payments that 
hospital is eligible to receive, as, 
pursuant to the statute, the hospital is 
treated as skipping a payment year. 
Payment adjustments apply to Medicare 
providers who are unable to 
demonstrate meaningful use starting in 
2015. 
Comment: One commenter asked if 
CMS could apply the same Medicaid 
EP’s first year incentive eligibility 
requirements of adopting, implementing 
or upgrading to certified EHR 
technology to Medicare physicians 
instead of demonstration of meaningful 
use. 
Response: The HITECH Act allows 
Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals to 
receive an incentive for the adoption, 
implementation, or upgrade of certified 
EHR technology in their first 
participation year. In subsequent years, 
these EPs and eligible hospitals must 
demonstrate that they are meaningful 
users. There are no parallel provisions 
under the Medicare EHR incentive 
program that would authorize us to 
make payments to Medicare EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs for the 
adoption, implementation or upgrade of 
certified EHR technology. Rather, in 
accordance with sections 1848(o)(2), 
1886(n)(3)(A), and 1814(l)(3)(A) of the 
Act, Medicare incentive payments are 
only made to EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs for the demonstration of 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology.

 44320 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the definitions of First payment year as 
proposed. For the Medicare EHR 
incentive programs, we are modifying 
the definitions of second, third, fourth, 
fifth payment year to make clear that 
these years are ‘‘each successive year 
following the first payment year.’’ For 
the Medicaid EHR incentive program, 
we included definitions of first, second, 
third, fourth, fifth and sixth payment 
year that make clear that these are the 
years for which payment is received. 
The regulations can now be found at 
§ 495.4 of our regulations. 
e. EHR Reporting Period 
In the proposed rule, we proposed a 
definition of EHR Reporting Period for 
purposes of the Medicare and Medicaid 
incentive payments under sections 
1848(o), 1853(l)(3), 1886(n), 1853(m)(3), 
1814(l) and 1903(t) of the Act. For these 
sections, we proposed that the EHR 
reporting period would be any 
continuous 90-day period within the 
first payment year and the entire 
payment year for all subsequent 
payment years. In our proposed rule, we 
did not make any proposals regarding 
the reporting period that will be used 
for purposes of the payment 
adjustments that begin in 2015. We 
intend to address this issue in future 
rulemaking, for purposes of Medicare 
incentive payment adjustments under 
sections 1848(a)(7), 1853(l)(4), 
1886(b)(3)(B)(ix), 1853(m)(4), and 
1814(l)(4) of the Act. 
For the first payment year only, we 
proposed to define the term EHR 
reporting period at § 495.4 of our 
regulations to mean any continuous 90- 
day period within a payment year in 
which an EP, eligible hospital or CAH 
successfully demonstrates meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology. The 
EHR reporting period therefore could be 
any continuous period beginning and 
ending within the relevant payment 
year. Starting with the second payment 
year and any subsequent payment years 
for a given EP, eligible hospital or CAH, 
we proposed to define the term EHR 
reporting period at § 495.4 to mean the 
entire payment year. In our discussion 
of considerations in defining 
meaningful use later in this section we 
discuss how this policy may be affected 
by subsequent revisions to the 
definition of meaningful use. 
For the first payment year, we stated 
in the proposed rule our belief that 
giving EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs 
flexibility as to the start date of the EHR 
reporting period is important, as 
unforeseen circumstances, such as 
delays in implementation, higher than 
expected training needs and other 
unexpected hindrances, may cause an 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
potentially miss a target start date. 
Comment: Some commenters 
supported the 90-day reporting period 
proposed for the first payment year. One 
commenter requested that exceptions, 
per the provider request, be considered 
individually in cases of compliance for 
less than the 90 days (for example, 85 
days). Commenters preferred the 90-day 
reporting period overall and many 
suggested it be used for subsequent 
years as well. We also received 
comments questioning why Medicaid 
providers would need to conform to the 
90-day reporting period in order to 
adopt, implement or upgrade certified 
EHR technology. 
Response: We do believe that for 
program integrity it is crucial to 
maintain a consistent reporting period. 
Basing the incentive payments on 
meaningful use implies a minimum 
level of use in order to receive the 
incentive payment. The timeframe is 
part of the determination of whether use 
is meaningful and therefore requires a 
minimum as well. Given the short time 
period as compared to the entire year, 
we do not believe an exception process 
is needed. However, we agree with 
commenters that an EHR reporting 
period for demonstrating adoption, 
implementation or upgrading certified 
EHR technology by Medicaid EPs and 
eligible hospitals is unnecessary and are 
removing it for the final rule in this 
instance. Similarly, Medicaid EPs and 
eligible hospitals who are demonstrating 
meaningful use for the first time in their 
second payment year, will have a 90- 
day reporting period to maintain parity 
with Medicare providers’ first 
meaningful use payment year. We do 
not believe that after successfully 
demonstrating meaningful use, a 90-day 
period is appropriate for subsequent 
years. The reasons for using the 90-day 
period instead of the full year are based 
on potential delays in implementing 
certifying EHR technology. Once 
certified EHR technology is 
implemented these are no longer 
applicable. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received and with the 
clarification described above for 
adopting, implementing or upgrading, 
we are finalizing the 90-day reporting 
period for the first payment year based 
on meaningful use as proposed for 
Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs and full year EHR reporting 
periods for subsequent payment years. 
For Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals, 
the EHR reporting period will be a 90- 
day period for the first year a Medicaid 
EP or eligible hospital demonstrates 
meaningful use and full year EHR 
reporting periods for subsequent 
payment years. 
f. Meaningful EHR User 
Section 1848(o)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, 
limits incentive payments under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program to 
an EP who is a ‘‘meaningful EHR user.’’ 
Similarly, section 1886(n)(1) and 1814(l) 
of the Act, limits incentive payments 
under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program to an eligible hospital or CAH, 
respectively, who is a ‘‘meaningful EHR 
user.’’ Section 1903(t)(6)(C)(i)(II) of the 
Act limits incentive payments for 
payment years other than the first 
payment year to a Medicaid EP or 
eligible hospital who ‘‘demonstrates 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology.’’ We proposed to define at 
§ 495.4 the term ‘‘meaningful EHR user’’ 
as an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH who, 
for an EHR reporting period for a 
payment year, demonstrates meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology in the 
form and manner consistent with our 
standards (discussed below). 
Comment: Several commenters 
indicated there is a need to align 
measures and programs, to avoid having 
to report similar measure standards to 
different Federal, State and other 
entities. 
Response: We concur with the goal of 
alignment to avoid redundant and 
duplicative reporting and seek to 
accomplish this to the extent possible 
now and in future rulemaking. 
Comment: Several commenters 
suggested that CMS considers EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs who are 
participating in certain existing 
programs as meaningful EHR users. The 
commenters contended that the 
standards followed by participants in 
these programs are equivalent to those 
we proposed to adopt for purposes of 
demonstrating meaningful use. The 
programs recommended by commenters 
are— 
• Qualified Health Information 
Exchange Networks; and 
• Medicare Electronic Health Record 
Demonstration Program. 
Response: We do not agree that 
participation in these programs would 
be the equivalent to demonstrating 
meaningful use in accordance with the 
criteria under the EHR incentive 
programs. Most of these programs place 
a heavy focus on one of the five 
priorities of meaningful use discussed 
in the next section such as reporting 
clinical quality measures or the 
exchange of health information, tailored 
to the individual program’s goals. For 
example, the goal of the Medicare

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Electronic Health Record Demonstration 
Program, for example, which was 
started in 2009 and pre-dates passage of 
the HITECH Act, is to reward delivery 
of high-quality care supported by the 
adoption and use of electronic health 
records in physician small to medium- 
size primary care practices. The purpose 
of this program is to encourage adoption 
and increasingly sophisticated use of 
EHRs by small to medium-sized primary 
care practices. While this goal is similar 
to the overall objective of the HITECH 
Act, the requirements for the 
demonstration are not as broad-based as 
that of the HITECH Act, and payment 
incentives are based on the level of use 
over the duration of the program, which 
will vary by practice. Therefore, it is not 
appropriate to deem practices 
participating in the EHR Demonstration 
as meaningful users for purposes of the 
HITECH Act. The HITECH Act also 
requires use certified EHR technology as 
defined by ONC to qualify for incentive 
payments. While CCHIT has certified 
EHR technology in the past, the ONC 
regulation ‘‘Establishment of the 
Temporary Certification Program for 
Health Information Technology; Final 
Rule’’ (see 75 FR 36157) which 
establishes a temporary certifying body 
has yet to be established. Where 
possible, we have aligned the criteria 
required to demonstrate meaningful use 
with existing programs like PQRI and 
RHQDAPU as discussed in section 
II.A.3 of this final rule. After 
consideration of the public comments 
received, we are finalizing our 
definition of a meaningful EHR user as 
proposed. 
2. Definition of Meaningful Use 
a. Considerations in Defining 
Meaningful Use 
In sections 1848(o)(2)(A) and 
1886(n)(3)(A) of the Act, the Congress 
identified the broad goal of expanding 
the use of EHRs through the term 
meaningful use. In section 1903(t)(6)(C) 
of the Act, Congress applies the 
definition of meaningful use to 
Medicaid eligible professionals and 
eligible hospitals as well. Certified EHR 
technology used in a meaningful way is 
one piece of a broader HIT 
infrastructure needed to reform the 
health care system and improve health 
care quality, efficiency, and patient 
safety. HHS believes this ultimate vision 
of reforming the health care system and 
improving health care quality, efficiency 
and patient safety should drive the 
definition of meaningful use consistent 
with the applicable provisions of 
Medicare and Medicaid law. 
In the proposed rule we explained 
that in defining meaningful use we 
sought to balance the sometimes 
competing considerations of improving 
health care quality, encouraging 
widespread EHR adoption, promoting 
innovation, and avoiding imposing 
excessive or unnecessary burdens on 
health care providers, while at the same 
time recognizing the short timeframe 
available under the HITECH Act for 
providers to begin using certified EHR 
technology. 
Based on public and stakeholder 
input received prior to publishing the 
proposed rule, we consider a phased 
approach to be most appropriate. Such 
a phased approach encompasses 
reasonable criteria for meaningful use 
based on currently available technology 
capabilities and provider practice 
experience, and builds up to a more 
robust definition of meaningful use, 
based on anticipated technology and 
capabilities development. The HITECH 
Act acknowledges the need for this 
balance by granting the Secretary the 
discretion to require more stringent 
measures of meaningful use over time. 
Ultimately, consistent with other 
provisions of law, meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology should result 
in health care that is patient centered, 
evidence-based, prevention-oriented, 
efficient, and equitable. 
Under this phased approach to 
meaningful use, we intend to update the 
criteria of meaningful use through 
future rulemaking. We refer to the initial 
meaningful use criteria as ‘‘Stage 1.’’ We 
currently anticipate two additional 
updates, which we refer to as Stage 2 
and Stage 3, respectively. We expect to 
update the meaningful use criteria on a 
biennial basis, with the Stage 2 criteria 
by the end of 2011 and the Stage 3 
criteria by the end of 2013. The stages 
represent an initial graduated approach 
to arriving at the ultimate goal. 
• Stage 1: The Stage 1 meaningful use 
criteria, consistent with other provisions 
of Medicare and Medicaid law, focuses 
on electronically capturing health 
information in a structured format; 
using that information to track key 
clinical conditions and communicating 
that information for care coordination 
purposes (whether that information is 
structured or unstructured, but in 
structured format whenever feasible); 
implementing clinical decision support 
tools to facilitate disease and 
medication management; using EHRs to 
engage patients and families and 
reporting clinical quality measures and 
public health information. Stage 1 
focuses heavily on establishing the 
functionalities in certified EHR 
technology that will allow for 
continuous quality improvement and 
ease of information exchange. By having 
these functionalities in certified EHR 
technology at the onset of the program 
and requiring that the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH become familiar with 
them through the varying levels of 
engagement required by Stage 1, we 
believe we will create a strong 
foundation to build on in later years. 
Though some functionalities are 
optional in Stage 1, as outlined in 
discussions later in this rule, all of the 
functionalities are considered crucial to 
maximize the value to the health care 
system provided by certified EHR 
technology. We encourage all EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs to be 
proactive in implementing all of the 
functionalities of Stage 1 in order to 
prepare for later stages of meaningful 
use, particularly functionalities that 
improve patient care, the efficiency of 
the health care system and public and 
population health. The specific criteria 
for Stage 1 of meaningful use are 
discussed at section II.2.c of this final 
rule. 
• Stage 2: Our goals for the Stage 2 
meaningful use criteria, consistent with 
other provisions of Medicare and 
Medicaid law, expand upon the Stage 1 
criteria to encourage the use of health IT 
for continuous quality improvement at 
the point of care and the exchange of 
information in the most structured 
format possible, such as the electronic 
transmission of orders entered using 
computerized provider order entry 
(CPOE) and the electronic transmission 
of diagnostic test results (such as blood 
tests, microbiology, urinalysis, 
pathology tests, radiology, cardiac 
imaging, nuclear medicine tests, 
pulmonary function tests, genetic tests, 
genomic tests and other such data 
needed to diagnose and treat disease). 
For the final rule, we elaborate on our 
plans for Stage 2. We expect that stage 
two meaningful use requirements will 
include rigorous expectations for health 
information exchange, including more 
demanding requirements for e- 
prescribing and incorporating structured 
laboratory results and the expectation 
that providers will electronically 
transmit patient care summaries to 
support transitions in care across 
unaffiliated providers, settings and EHR 
systems. Increasingly robust 
expectations for health information 
exchange in stage two and stage three 
will support and make real the goal that 
information follows the patient. We 
expect that Stage 2 will build upon 
Stage 1 by both altering the expectations 
of the functionalities in Stage 1 and 
likely adding new functionalities which

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
are not yet ready for inclusion in Stage 
1, but whose provision is necessary to 
maximize the potential of EHR 
technology. As discussed later in this 
final rule, we are making some 
objectives of the Stage 1 of meaningful 
use optional and other required. We will 
consider every objective that is optional 
for Stage 1 to be required in Stage 2 as 
well as revaluate the thresholds and 
exclusions of all the measures both 
percentage based and those currently a 
yes/no attestation. Additionally, we may 
consider applying the criteria more 
broadly to all outpatient hospital 
settings (not just the emergency 
department). 
• Stage 3: Our goals for the Stage 3 
meaningful use criteria are, consistent 
with other provisions of Medicare and 
Medicaid law, to focus on promoting 
improvements in quality, safety and 
efficiency leading to improved health 
outcomes, focusing on decision support 
for national high priority conditions, 
patient access to self management tools, 
access to comprehensive patient data 
through robust, patient-centered health 
information exchange and improving 
population health. 
We did not include regulatory 
provisions for Stage 2 or Stage 3 in our 
proposal and with one exception 
discussed under the CPOE objective, we 
are not finalizing Stage 2 or Stage 3 
requirements at this time. However, we 
plan to build upon Stage 1 by increasing 
the expectations of the functionalities in 
Stage 1 and adding new objectives for 
Stage 2. In our next rulemaking, we 
currently intend to propose that every 
objective in the menu set for Stage 1 (as 
described later in this section) be 
included in Stage 2 as part of the core 
set. While allowing providers flexibility 
in setting priorities for EHR 
implementation takes into account their 
unique circumstances, we maintain that 
all the objectives are crucial to building 
a strong foundation for health IT and to 
meeting the statutory objectives of the 
Act. In addition, as indicated in our 
proposed rule, we anticipate raising the 
threshold for these objectives in both 
Stage 2 and 3 as the capabilities of HIT 
infrastructure increases. For Stage 2, we 
intend to review the thresholds and 
measures associated with all Stage 1 
objectives considering advances in 
technology, changes in standard 
practice, and changes in the 
marketplace (for example, wider 
adoption of information technology by 
pharmacies) and propose, as 
appropriate, increases in these 
requirements. 
We recognize that the thresholds 
included in the final regulation are 
ambitious for the current state of 
technology and standards of care. 
However, we expect the delivery of 
health care to evolve through the 
inception of the HITECH incentive 
programs and implementation of the 
Affordable Care Act prior to finalizing 
Stage 2. Furthermore, data collected 
from the initial attestations of 
meaningful use will be used to ensure 
that the thresholds of the measures that 
accompany the objectives in Stage 2 are 
continue to aggressively advance the use 
of certified EHR technology. Finally, we 
continue to anticipate redefining our 
objectives to include not only the 
capturing of data in electronic format 
but also the exchange (both 
transmission and receipt) of that data in 
increasingly structured formats. As 
appropriate, we intend to propose the 
addition of new objectives to capture 
new functions that are necessary to 
maximize the potential of EHR 
technology, but were not ready for Stage 
1. For instance, we would consider 
adding measures related to CPOE orders 
for services beyond medication orders. 
The intent and policy goal for raising 
these thresholds and expectations is to 
ensure that meaningful use encourages 
patient-centric, interoperable health 
information exchange across provider 
organizations. 
We will continue to evaluate the 
progression of the meaningful use 
definition for consistency with the 
HITECH ACT and any future statutory 
requirements relating to quality 
measurement and administrative 
simplification. As the purpose of these 
incentives is to encourage the adoption 
and meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology, we believe it is desirable to 
account for whether an EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH is in their first, second, 
third, fourth, fifth, or sixth payment 
year when deciding which definition of 
meaningful use to apply in the 
beginning years of the program. The HIT 
Policy Committee in its public meeting 
on July 16, 2009 also voiced its approval 
of this approach. However, such 
considerations are dependent on future 
rulemaking, so for this final rule Stage 
1 criteria for meaningful use are valid 
for all payments years until updated by 
future rulemaking. 
We proposed that Medicare EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs whose first 
payment year is 2011 must satisfy the 
requirements of the Stage 1 criteria of 
meaningful use in their first and second 
payment years (2011 and 2012) to 
receive the incentive payments. We 
anticipate updating the criteria of 
meaningful use to Stage 2 in time for the 
2013 payment year and therefore 
anticipate for their third and fourth 
payment years (2013 and 2014), an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH whose first 
payment year is 2011 would have to 
satisfy the Stage 2 criteria of meaningful 
use to receive the incentive payments. 
We proposed that Medicare EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs whose first 
payment year is 2012 must satisfy the 
Stage 1 criteria of meaningful use in 
their first and second payment years 
(2012 and 2013) to receive the incentive 
payments. We anticipate updating the 
criteria of meaningful use to Stage 2 in 
time for the 2013 payment year and 
anticipate for their third payment year 
(2014), an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
whose first payment year is 2012 would 
have to satisfy the Stage 2 criteria of 
meaningful use to receive the incentive 
payments. We discussed in the 
proposed rule that Medicare EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs whose first 
payment year is 2013 must satisfy the 
Stage 1 criteria of meaningful use in 
their first payment year (2013) to receive 
the incentive payments. We anticipate 
updating the criteria of meaningful use 
to Stage 2 in time for the 2013 payment 
year and therefore anticipate for their 
second payment year (2014), an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH whose first 
payment year is 2013 would have to 
satisfy the Stage 2 criteria of meaningful 
use to receive the incentive payments. 
We discussed in the proposed rule that 
Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs whose first payment year is 2014 
must satisfy the Stage 1 criteria of 
meaningful use in their first payment 
year (2014) to receive the incentive 
payments. In the proposed rule, we 
discussed the idea that alignment of 
stage of meaningful use and payment 
year should synchronize for all 
providers in 2015, and requested 
comment on the need to create such 
alignment. After reviewing public 
comment on this issue, our goal remains 
to align the stages of meaningful use 
across all providers in 2015. However, 
we acknowledge the concerns regarding 
the different Medicare and Medicaid 
incentive timelines, as well as concerns 
about whether Stage 3 would be 
appropriate for an EP’s, eligible 
hospital’s or CAH’s first payment year at 
any point in the future and believe the 
issue needs additional review and 
discussion before we lay out a clear path 
forward for 2015 and beyond. Therefore, 
we have decided to remove language in 
the final rule discussing our possible 
directions for any year beyond 2014. We 
will address the years beyond 2014 in 
later rulemaking. Table 1 outlines how 
we anticipate applying the respective 
criteria of meaningful use in the first 
years of the program, and how we 
anticipate applying such criteria for

subsequent payment years, through 
2014. Please note that nothing in this 
discussion restricts us from requiring 
additional stages of meaningful use 
(beyond stage 3) through future 
rulemaking. In addition, as we expect to 
engage in rulemaking to adopt the 
criteria that will accompany Stages 2 
and 3 of meaningful use, stakeholders 
should wait for those rulemakings to 
determine what will be required for 
those Stages and should not view the 
discussions in this preamble or final 
rule as binding the agency to any 
specific definition for those future 
stages. 
Please note that each of the EHR 
incentive programs has different rules 
regarding the number of payment years 
available, the last year for which 
incentives may be received, and the last 
payment year that can be the first 
payment year for an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH. The applicable 
payment years and the incentive 
payments available for each program are 
also discussed in section II.C. of this 
final rule for the Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive program, in section II.D. of 
this final rule for the MA EHR incentive 
program, and in section II.E. of this final 
rule for the Medicaid EHR incentive 
program. 
Comment: Numerous commenters 
noted that it is inappropriate to align the 
Medicaid EHR incentive payment 
program with the Medicare program due 
to the lack of penalties in the Medicaid 
program and due to the option for 
Medicaid providers to participate in 
their first year by adopting, 
implementing, or upgrading certified 
EHR technology. 
Response: This was not the only 
reason for having all EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs align by 2015. 
However, as we are not addressing 
stages of meaningful use beyond 2014 in 
this final rule, potential alignment is not 
discussed. We will reconsider this 
comment in future rulemaking. 
The stages of criteria of meaningful 
use and how they are demonstrated are 
described further in this final rule and 
will be updated in subsequent 
rulemaking to reflect advances in HIT 
products and infrastructure. We note 
that such future rulemaking might also 
include updates to the Stage 1 criteria. 
We invited comment on our 
alignment between payment year and 
the criteria of meaningful use 
particularly in regards to the need to 
create alignment across all EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs in all EHR 
incentive programs in 2015. 
Comment: Many commenters 
requested that if there continued to be 
a year where all EPs, eligible hospitals 
and CAHs must meet the same stage of 
meaningful use that that year be 2017, 
rather than 2015 as we had discussed in 
the proposed rule. These commenters 
asserted that EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs whose first payment year is after 
2011 might not have sufficient time to 
reach the Stage 3 of meaningful use 
criteria by 2015. Some commenters 
pointed out that while the HITECH Act 
states that 2015 is the first year of 
payment adjustments, it provides for 
escalation of the payment adjustments 
so that they do not reach their full levels 
until 2017. 
Response: As we explained in the 
proposed rule, equity in the level of 
meaningful use across all EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs subject to the 
payment adjustment was not the only 
reason for our plan that all EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs satisfy the Stage 3 
criteria for either the Medicare or 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs. The 
achievement of many of the ultimate 
goals of meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology are dependent on a critical 
mass of EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs all being meaningful EHR users. 
Exchange of health information is most 
valuable when it is so robust that it can 
be relied upon to provide a complete or 
nearly complete picture of a patient’s 
health. For example, robust Stage 3 
meaningful use by an EP does not assist 
that EP in avoiding ordering a 
duplicative test, if the EP with 
information on the original test is only 
a Stage 1 meaningful EHR user and is 
not yet exchanging that information. 
This dependency is key to the need to 
get to Stage 3 for all providers. Another 
reason for alignment at Stage 3 in 2015 
is that many of the barriers to 
functionalities of EHRs that exist today 
as may no longer exist in 2015. The 
existence of these barriers today is one 
of the primary reasons for having a 
staged approach as opposed to requiring 
more robust meaningful use at the 
beginning of the program. Providers, 
developers of EHRs, government and 
non-governmental organizations are all 
working to remove these barriers. We 
believe it is likely there will be success 
in removing many of these barriers, 
which would make many of the 
compromises made in Stage 1 no longer 
necessary by 2015. However, due to the 
many comments on alignment starting 
in 2015 and our plan to engage in 
additional more rounds of rulemaking, 
we are removing discussion of actual 
alignment between the first payment 
year of an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
and the Stage of meaningful use they 
will be expected to meet for all years 
after 2014. Our policies for 2015 and 
subsequent years will be determined 
through future rulemaking. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that CMS base the payment 
adjustments on Stage 1 of meaningful 
use regardless of the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH’s prior participation in 
the incentive program. 
Response: We thank commenters for 
the thoughtful comments received, and 
will take their input into consideration 
when in future rulemaking when we 
consider whether to require that EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs satisfy the 
stage 3 definition of meaningful use in 
order to avoid reduced payments under 
Medicare for their professional services 
and inpatient hospital services 
beginning 2015. We reiterate, however, 
that in this final rule we are only 
adopting criteria that we expect will

apply in 2011 and 2012. We have also 
outlined the expected progression of 
stages of meaningful use criteria until 
2014. However, we are not in this rule 
finalizing regulations that address the 
meaningful use standards that apply in 
2015 and thereafter. 
Comment: Numerous commenters 
requested that we specifically propose 
objectives and measures for Stage 2 and 
3. We also received recommendations 
on what those objectives and, in rare 
cases, measures should be. We 
discussed some of these objectives in 
the proposed rule and discuss them 
again in this final rule in section II.d. 
Others are highly related to existing 
objectives, while still others were not 
discussed in any way in the proposed 
rule. The suggested objectives and 
measures for Stages 2 and 3 include the 
following: 
• Use of evidence-based order sets. 
• Electronic medication 
administration record (eMAR). 
• Bedside medication administration 
support (barcode/RFID). 
• Record nursing assessment in EHR. 
• Record nursing plan of care in EHR. 
• Record physician assessment in 
EHR. 
• Record physician notes in EHR. 
• Multimedia/Imaging integration. 
• Generate permissible discharge 
prescriptions electronically. 
• Contribute data to a PHR. 
• Record patient preferences 
(language, etc). 
• Provide electronic access to patient- 
specific educational resources. 
• Asking patients about their 
experience of care. 
Response: With one exception 
discussed under the CPOE objective, we 
continue to believe that finalizing 
specific objectives and measures for 
later stages is inappropriate. One of the 
greatest benefits of the phased stage 
approach is the ability to consider the 
impact and lessons of the prior stage 
when formulating a new stage. Many 
commenters supported our discussion 
of later stages for this very reason. In 
addition, we do not believe it is 
appropriate to finalize objectives for any 
stage of meaningful use that were not 
specifically discussed in the proposed 
rule, as doing so would deprive the 
public the opportunity to comment on 
the objective in question. Nevertheless, 
we thank commenters for the thoughtful 
comments received, and expect to take 
their input into consideration when in 
future rulemaking we consider 
additional or revised criteria and 
measures to adopt for the stage 2 and 
stage 3 definitions of meaningful use. 
Comment: A commenter indicated 
that attestation is an insufficient means 
to hold providers accountable for the 
expenditure of public funds and to 
protect against fraud and abuse. 
Response: We likewise are concerned 
with the potential fraud and abuse. 
However, Congress for the HITECH Act 
specifically authorized submission of 
information as to meaningful use 
through attestation. CMS is developing 
an audit strategy to ameliorate and 
address the risk of fraud and abuse. 
b. Common Definition of Meaningful 
Use Under Medicare and Medicaid 
Under sections 1848(o)(1)(A)(i), 
1814(l)(3)(A), and 1886(n)(1) of the Act, 
an EP, eligible hospital or CAH must be 
a meaningful EHR user for the relevant 
EHR reporting period in order to qualify 
for the incentive payment for a payment 
year in the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program. Sections 1848(o)(2)(A) and 
1886(n)(3)(A) of the Act provide that an 
EP and an eligible hospital shall be 
considered a meaningful EHR user for 
an EHR reporting period for a payment 
year if they meet the following three 
requirements: (1) Demonstrates use of 
certified EHR technology in a 
meaningful manner; (2) demonstrates to 
the satisfaction of the Secretary that 
certified EHR technology is connected 
in a manner that provides for the 
electronic exchange of health 
information to improve the quality of 
health care such as promoting care 
coordination, in accordance with all 
laws and standards applicable to the 
exchange of information; and (3) using 
its certified EHR technology, submits to 
the Secretary, in a form and manner 
specified by the Secretary, information 
on clinical quality measures and other 
measures specified by the Secretary. 
The HITECH Act requires that to receive 
a Medicaid incentive payment in the 
initial year of payment, an EP or eligible 
hospital may demonstrate that they have 
engaged in efforts to ‘‘adopt, implement, 
or upgrade certified EHR technology.’’ 
Details, including special timeframes, 
on how we define and implement 
‘‘adopt, implement, and upgrade’’ are in 
section II.D.7.b.2 of this final rule. For 
subsequent payment years, or the first 
payment year if an EP or eligible 
hospital chooses, section 
1903(t)(6)(C)(i)(II) of the Act, prohibits 
receipt of an incentive payment, unless 
‘‘the Medicaid provider demonstrates 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology through a means that is 
approved by the State and acceptable to 
the Secretary, and that may be based 
upon the methodologies applied under 
section 1848(o) or 1886(n).’’ (Sections 
1848(o) and 1886(n) of the Act refer to 
the Medicare EHR incentive programs 
for EPs and eligible hospitals/CAHs 
respectively.) Under section 1903(t)(8) 
of the Act to the maximum extent 
practicable, we are directed to avoid 
duplicative requirements from Federal 
and State governments to demonstrate 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. Provisions included at 
section 1848(o)(1)(D)(iii) of the Act also 
contain a Congressional mandate to 
avoid duplicative requirements for 
meaningful use, to the extent 
practicable. Finally, section 1903(t)(8) of 
the Act allows the Secretary to deem 
satisfaction of the requirements for 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology for a payment year under 
Medicare to qualify as meaningful use 
under Medicaid. 
We stated in the proposed rule that 
we believe that given the strong level of 
interaction on meaningful use 
encouraged by the HITECH Act, there 
would need to be a compelling reason 
to create separate definitions for 
Medicare and Medicaid. We declared in 
the proposed rule that we had found no 
such reasons for disparate definitions in 
our internal or external discussions. To 
the contrary, stakeholders have 
expressed strong preferences to link the 
Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive 
programs wherever possible. Hospitals 
are entitled to participate in both 
programs, and we proposed to offer EPs 
an opportunity to switch between the 
Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive 
programs. Therefore, we proposed to 
create a common definition of 
meaningful use that would serve as the 
definition for EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs participating in the Medicare FFS 
and MA EHR incentive program, and 
the minimum standard for EPs and 
eligible hospitals participating in the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program. We 
clarified that under Medicaid this 
proposed common definition would be 
the minimum standard. We proposed to 
allow States to add additional objectives 
to the definition of meaningful use or 
modify how the existing objectives are 
measured; the Secretary would not 
accept any State alternative that does 
not further promote the use of EHRs and 
healthcare quality or that would require 
additional functionality beyond that of 
certified EHR technology. See section 
II.D.8. of this final rule for further 
details. 
For hospitals, we proposed to exercise 
the option granted under section 
1903(t)(8) of the Act and deem any 
Medicare eligible hospital or CAH who 
is a meaningful EHR user under the 
Medicare EHR incentive program and is 
otherwise eligible for the Medicaid 
incentive payment to be classified as a 
meaningful EHR user under the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program. This

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
is applicable only to eligible hospitals 
and CAHs, as EPs cannot 
simultaneously receive an incentive 
payment under both Medicare and 
Medicaid. 
We solicited comments as to whether 
there are compelling reasons to give the 
States additional flexibility in creating 
disparate definitions beyond what was 
proposed. In addition, if commenting in 
favor of such disparate definitions, we 
also asked interested parties to comment 
on whether the proposal of deeming 
meeting the Medicare definition as 
sufficient for meeting the Medicaid 
definition remains appropriate under 
the disparate definitions. This is 
applicable only to hospitals eligible for 
both the Medicare and Medicaid 
incentive programs. Furthermore, if a 
State has CMS-approved additional 
meaningful use requirements, hospitals 
deemed as meaningful users by 
Medicare would not have to meet the 
State-specific additional meaningful use 
requirements in order to qualify for the 
Medicaid incentive payment. 
Comment: Most commenters believe 
that States should not be allowed the 
option to add to or change the 
meaningful use requirements for the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program. The 
commenters’ main reason for 
standardizing the meaningful use 
requirements for both Medicare and 
Medicaid is to eliminate administrative 
burden on both providers and EHR 
vendors to accommodate programming 
and reporting using different technical 
specifications for the same or similar 
measures. 
Response: After consideration of the 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the provisions regarding possible 
differences in the definition of 
meaningful use between Medicare and 
Medicaid with the following revisions. 
We believe that over time the option to 
add to or change the floor definition of 
meaningful use might represent an 
important policy tool for States and 
therefore CMS plans to review and 
adjudicate these requests over the 
duration of the program. For Stage 1 of 
meaningful use, we have revised the 
definition of meaningful use in response 
to the many comments and are requiring 
an overall lower bar and an approach 
that is more flexible. On the other hand, 
we wish to support the ability for States 
to reinforce their public health priorities 
and goals based upon their existing 
public health infrastructure and 
maturity. For that reason, we, for Stage 
1, will only entertain States’ requests to 
tailor the Stage 1 meaningful use 
definition as it pertains specifically to 
public health objectives and data 
registries. For purposes of the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program during Stage 1 
of meaningful use, these are limited to: 
Objective: Generate lists of patients by 
specific conditions to use for quality 
improvement, reduction of disparities, 
research, or outreach. 
Measure: Generate at least one report 
listing patients of the EP or eligible 
hospital with a specific condition. 
Example: Generate lists of patients 
with the following conditions: 
depression, diabetes, obesity, etc. This 
would not be for reporting to the State 
but to draw EPs’ or eligible hospitals’ 
attention in order to better manage their 
patient population. States would also be 
permitted to request CMS approval to 
include this in the core set for all EPs 
and/or eligible hospitals. 
Objective: Capability to submit 
electronic data to immunization 
registries of Immunization Information 
Systems and actual submission in 
accordance with applicable law and 
practice. 
Measure: Performed at least one test 
of certified EHR technology’s capacity to 
submit electronic data to immunization 
registries and follow up submission if 
the test is successful (unless none of the 
immunization registries to which the EP 
or eligible hospital submits such 
information have the capacity to 
received the information electronically). 
Example: State could point to a 
specific immunization registry that 
supports standards-based transmission 
of data and dictate how that information 
is transmitted. States would also be 
permitted to request CMS approval to 
include this objective in the core list for 
all EPs and eligible hospitals. The 
justification for this request in their 
State Medicaid HIT Plan, should 
address any potential barriers for 
providers in achieving this objective. 
Objective: Capability to submit 
electronic data on reportable (as 
required by state or local law) lab results 
to public health agencies and actual 
submission in accordance with 
applicable law and practice. 
Measure: Performed at least one test 
of certified EHR technology’s capacity to 
submit electronic data on reportable lab 
results to public health agencies and 
follow-up submission if the test is 
successful (unless none of the public 
health agencies to which an eligible 
hospital submits such information have 
the capacity to receive the information 
electronically). 
Example: State could specify the 
standards-based means of transmission 
and/or the destination of this data. 
States would also be permitted to 
request CMS approval to include this 
objective in the core list for all and 
eligible hospitals. The justification for 
this request in their State Medicaid HIT 
Plan, should address any potential 
barriers for providers in achieving this 
objective. 
Objective: Capability to submit 
electronic syndromic surveillance data 
to public health agencies and actual 
transmission according to applicable 
law and practice. 
Measure: Performed at least one test 
of certified EHR technology’s capacity to 
submit electronic syndromic 
surveillance data to public health 
agencies and follow-up submission if 
the test is successful (unless none of the 
public health agencies to which an EP 
or eligible hospital submits such 
information have the capacity to receive 
the information electronically). 
Example: State could specify the 
standards-based means of transmission 
and/or the destination of this data. 
States would also be permitted to 
request CMS approval to include this 
objective in the core list for all EPs and 
eligible hospitals. The justification for 
this request in their State Medicaid HIT 
Plan, should address any potential 
barriers for providers in achieving this 
objective. 
We reiterate that we will not approve 
any requests that would require EHR 
functionality above and beyond that 
included in the ONC EHR certification 
criteria as finalized for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that CMS affirm the ability of 
States to require additional meaningful 
use criteria for all eligible professionals 
and hospitals (pursuant to §§ 495.316(a), 
495.316(d)(2)), regardless of whether 
those entities were deemed eligible 
through Medicare. 
Response: Section 1903(t)(8) provides 
authority for the Secretary to ‘‘deem 
satisfaction of requirements for * * * 
meaningful use for a payment year 
under title XVIII to be sufficient to 
qualify as meaningful use under 
[1903(t)].’’ We continue to believe that 
allowing deeming ensures that hospitals 
eligible for both programs are able to 
focus on only one set of measures, 
without requiring duplication of effort 
or confusion regarding meaningful use 
standards. Thus, hospitals eligible for 
both Medicare and Medicaid incentive 
payments will be deemed for Medicaid 
if they have met the meaningful use 
definition through Medicare, even if a 
State has an approved State-specific 
definition of meaningful use. States 
cannot withhold a Medicaid EHR 
incentive payment from dually eligible 
hospitals if they have met all the 
eligibility criteria for Medicaid, and 
have met the Medicare definition for 
meaningful use.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Because of this comment, we are 
revising section § 495.4 of our 
regulations to indicate that eligible 
hospitals who are meaningful users 
under the Medicare EHR incentive 
payment program are deemed as 
meaningful users under the Medicaid 
EHR incentive payment program, and 
need not meet additional criteria 
imposed by the State. While this is not 
a new requirement, it was not 
previously listed in regulations. 
Comment: A commenter asked that 
CMS adopt and affirm the deeming 
approach in its final rule and ensure 
that the regulatory language reflects this 
approach. 
Response: We agree and have 
included in the final rule regulation 
language that hospitals that are 
meaningful users under the Medicare 
EHR Incentive Program are deemed 
meaningful users under the Medicaid 
EHR Program. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that CMS not deem hospitals 
having met the meaningful use 
requirements for the Medicare EHR 
Incentive Payment, as having fulfilled 
the meaningful use requirements for the 
State’s Medicaid EHR Incentive 
Payment. The commenters noted that if 
a State sought for acute care hospitals to 
participate in their statewide health 
information exchange and yet those 
hospitals did not have to do so in order 
to qualify for both the Medicare and 
Medicaid EHR Incentive Payments, then 
they would have no motivation to do so. 
The commenters would like acute care 
hospitals eligible for both the Medicare 
and Medicaid EHR Incentive Program to 
have to comply with any State-specific 
meaningful use requirements, in 
addition to the Medicare floor 
definition. 
Response: In consideration of the 
comments received, CMS adopts its 
proposed preamble language about 
deeming hospitals and adds the 
corresponding regulation text. This is 
necessary for Stage 1 of meaningful use 
in particular, where we believe it is 
crucial to prevent additional burden on 
providers and foster eligible hospitals’ 
path to successful EHR adoption and 
meaningful use. In addition, as already 
noted, for Stage 1, we will not entertain 
States’ requests to alter the floor 
definition of meaningful use as codified 
in this final rule except for specific 
public health objectives. That thereby 
reduces the possible differences 
between the Medicare and Medicaid 
definitions of meaningful use. As part of 
Stage 2 of meaningful use, CMS might 
consider States requests to tailor 
meaningful use as it pertains to health 
information exchange, for example. 
Further details about this policy option 
will be included in future rulemaking 
and subject to public comment. 
c. Stage 1 Criteria for Meaningful Use 
In the proposed rule we proposed that 
to qualify as a meaningful EHR user for 
2011, EPs, eligible hospitals or CAHs 
must demonstrate that they meet all of 
the objectives and their associated 
measures as set forth in proposed 
§ 495.6. We further proposed and 
finalize in this final rule that except 
where otherwise indicated, each 
objective and its associated measure 
must be satisfied by an individual EP as 
determined by unique National Provider 
Identifiers (NPIs) and an individual 
hospital as determined by unique CMS 
certification numbers (CCN). 
Discussion of Whether an EP, Eligible 
Hospital or CAH Must Meet All Stage 1 
Meaningful Use Objectives and Their 
Associated Measures 
Comment: Commenters almost 
unanimously said that requiring an EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH to meet all of 
the objectives and their associated 
measures in order to qualify as a 
meaningful EHR user was too ambitious 
given the current state of EHR 
technology, adoption levels, the 
timeline for certification of EHR 
technologies, the realities of 
implementing EHR technology and the 
timeline proposed for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use in our proposed rule. 
Most of the commenters suggested 
alternatives that they believed would 
support the health care policy priorities 
of Stage 1. Several different alternatives 
were proposed. The first alternative 
would be to require a specified 
percentage of the Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives and associated measures, 
with an EP, eligible hospital or CAH free 
to select which of the objectives and 
associated measures it would satisfy. 
For example under our proposed 
objectives and associated measures, if 
an EP were required to meet 20 percent, 
then an EP would be considered a 
meaningful EHR user if he or she 
satisfied any five of the proposed 
twenty–five objectives and associated 
measures. Most commenters suggesting 
this alternative envisioned that later 
stages of meaningful use would require 
that EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs 
satisfy a higher of the percentage of the 
objectives and associated measures. For 
example if 20 percent of the objectives 
and associated measures were required 
for Stage 1, then 50 percent might be 
required in Stage 2. 
After a fixed percentage, the 
suggestion next favored by commenters, 
including the HIT Policy Committee and 
MedPAC, was to divide the meaningful 
use objectives into two categories, a 
‘‘core set’’ of objectives and ‘‘menu set’’ 
of objectives. To be a considered a 
meaningful user under this approach, an 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH would be 
required to satisfy (1) all core set of 
objectives, and (2) a specified 
percentage of the menu set of objectives, 
with the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
free to select which of the menu set of 
objectives it would satisfy. For example, 
if five objectives were in the core set all 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs would 
have to meet those objectives. If twenty 
objectives were in the menu set, then 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs would 
not have to meet one or more of those 
objectives. Commenters varied widely 
as to which objectives should be 
included in the core set of objectives, as 
well as the percentage of menu set 
objectives an EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH must satisfy. 
Some commenters suggested that we 
simply reduce the number of objectives 
required for Stage 1 of meaningful use. 
Recommendations in this regard varied 
from reducing the required objectives to 
only just a few (the lowest number being 
three), limiting the required objectives 
to only to those objectives that affect 
health outcomes of individual patients, 
to targeted elimination of a few 
objectives. 
Finally, some commenters suggested 
that we eliminate all of the measures 
associated with the Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives and only require that EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs attest that 
they have attempted to meet each of the 
objectives. 
Response: After reviewing the 
comments, we agree that requiring that 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs satisfy 
all of the objectives and their associated 
measures in order to be considered a 
meaningful EHR user would impose too 
great a burden and would result in an 
unacceptably low number of EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs being able 
to qualify as meaningful EHR users in 
the first two years of the program. In 
considering an alternative approach, we 
have sought to develop an alternative 
that is responsive to some degree to all 
the concerns raised by the commenters. 
We have tried to reduce the 
requirements both in number required 
and in the thresholds of the associated 
measures and provide some flexibility 
as well. At the same time, however, we 
must be mindful of the relevant 
statutory requirements. Sections 1848 
(o)(2)(A) and 1886(n)(3) of the Act, 
specify three requirements for 
meaningful use: (1) Use of certified EHR 
technology in a meaningful manner (for 
example, electronic prescribing); (2) that

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
the certified EHR technology is 
connected in a manner that provides for 
the electronic exchange of health 
information to improve the quality of 
care; and (3) that, in using certified EHR 
technology, the provider submits to the 
Secretary information on clinical quality 
measures and such other measures 
selected by the Secretary. We believe 
that each EP, eligible hospital, and CAH 
must meet at least one objective within 
each of the three requirements for 
meaningful use. We are concerned that 
if we were to give EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs full discretion to 
select which meaningful use objectives 
they will satisfy, some providers would 
not choose one or more objectives 
within each of the three statutory 
requirements for meaningful use. 
Furthermore, we are concerned that 
affording EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs such flexibility as to which 
meaningful use objectives to meet 
would delay many of the goals outlined 
for meaningful use in section II.a.2. of 
this final rule. If in choosing what 
objectives to defer, one provider chooses 
to focus on improving processes to 
improve healthcare quality, another 
chooses to focus on being able to 
exchange health information and yet 
another on engaging patients and 
families it is possible that we would fail 
to accomplish any of these goals at a 
population level. For these reasons, we 
do not believe it would be appropriate 
to afford providers the unlimited 
flexibility to select which of the 
meaningful use objectives they will 
meet. Rather, as explained below, we 
believe providers at a minimum should 
have to satisfy a core set of objectives in 
order to qualify as meaningful EHR 
users. 
Similarly, while we agree that merely 
reducing the number of objectives 
would make meaningful use easier to 
achieve for most providers, we believe 
that this reduction does not afford the 
same flexibility to all providers to 
account for their individual difficulties 
in meeting meaningful use that some of 
the other alternatives do as allowing a 
provider to choose certain objectives to 
defer. Due to any number of 
circumstances such as EHR adoption 
level, availability of health information 
exchange network, size of practice or 
hospital, etc., an objective that is easy 
for one EP to achieve might be very 
difficult for another EP. Under this 
alternative, no allowance is made for 
those differences. Finally, we disagree 
that meaningful use should be limited to 
improving the health outcomes of 
individual patients. There are 
significant gains that meaningful use 
can achieve in the areas of public 
health, privacy and security, 
engagement of patients and their 
families and efficiency of care that may 
not improve health outcomes, but have 
significant other benefits such as 
engaging patients more fully in 
decisions affecting their health and 
reducing costs through increased 
efficiency of care. We believe that all of 
these have a significant impact on 
health outcome priorities. Therefore, we 
do not categorically reduce the number 
of objectives for Stage 1 definition of 
meaningful use. We consider requests to 
defer an objective to later stages of the 
meaningful use criteria or eliminate a 
specific objective below in our 
discussion of each objective. 
Comment: Another alternative that 
was recommended by a significant 
number of commenters was that we base 
the incentive payment amount on the 
number of stage 1 meaningful use 
objectives satisfied by an EP or eligible 
hospital, with those satisfying more 
objectives eligible for a higher incentive 
payment amount. While some 
commenters varied in the specifics or 
did not provide specifics, generally we 
take this to mean that if an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH met half of the 
objectives then they would receive half 
of the incentive payment they would 
have received had they met all the 
objectives. 
Response: The HITECH Act does not 
give us the authority to award partial 
payments. As discussed elsewhere in 
this final rule, sections 1848(o)(1)(A) of 
the Act specifies the payment incentive 
amount to which an EP who is a 
meaningful EHR user is entitled. 
Similarly, section 1886(n)(2) of the Act 
sets forth a formula for calculation of 
incentive payment amount to which an 
eligible hospital that is a meaningful 
EHR user is entitled. Similarly, section 
1814(l)(3)(A) of the Act sets forth a 
formula for calculation of incentive 
payment amount to which an eligible 
hospital that is a meaningful EHR user 
is entitled. Similarly, section 
1903(t)(4)(B) of the Act sets parameters 
for determining the Medicaid EHR 
incentive for Medicaid EP. None of 
these parameters are related to 
meaningful use. Similarly, section 
1903(t)(5)(A) of the Act sets forth a 
formula for calculation of the incentive 
payment amount to which a Medicaid 
eligible hospital is entitled. As we do 
not have the authority to alter these 
statutory formulas for calculating the 
incentive payment amounts under 
Medicare and Medicaid, we cannot pro 
rate the incentive payment amount 
based on the number of meaningful use 
objectives satisfied by an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are establishing 
a core set of objectives with associated 
measures and a menu set of objectives 
with associated measures. In order to 
qualify as a meaningful EHR user, an 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must 
successfully meet the measure for each 
objective in the core set and all but five 
of the objectives in the menu set. With 
one limitation, an EP, eligible hospital, 
or CAH may select any five objectives 
from the menu set to be removed from 
consideration for the determination of 
qualifying as a meaningful EHR user. 
Further discussion of the objectives, 
including additional details about their 
inclusion in the core set, can be found 
at each objective. 
We believe that establishing both a 
core and a menu set adds flexibility and 
allows the minimum statutory set to be 
met. In determining the objectives to 
include in the core set, we looked at all 
comments, especially those of the HIT 
Policy Committee and other 
commenters who recommended some 
required and optional elements. The 
HITECH Act requires the use of health 
information technology in improving 
the quality of health care, reducing 
medical errors, reducing health 
disparities, increasing prevention and 
improving the continuity of care among 
health care settings. In defining the core 
set of meaningful use objective, we 
believe the most crucial aspect to 
consider is meeting the three statutory 
guidelines provided in the HITECH Act 
and discussed in section II.A.2.a of this 
final rule. Second is to identify those 
objectives that are most crucial to laying 
the foundation for obtaining value from 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. Third, we believe that 
meaningful use should be patient- 
centered so we focus on getting the most 
value to the patient. We believe the 
recommendation of the HIT Policy 
Committee accomplishes third criteria, 
but falls short of the first and second. To 
accomplish the first criteria, we add the 
objective of submitting clinical quality 
measures to CMS or the States and the 
objective of exchanging key clinical 
information among providers of care 
and patient authorized entities. To 
accomplish the second, we add several 
additional objectives to the core set of 
measures as critical elements pertinent 
to the management of patients. We have 
received a number of comments in 
support of these particular measures as 
critical to the management of patients 
(maintaining an up-to-date problem list, 
active medication list, active allergy list, 
smoking history and incorporate clinical

lab tests into EHR as structured data) in 
comparison to other requirements. The 
addition of two other functional 
objectives (drug-drug and drug-allergy 
features) as core measures are for 
improved patient-safety. All of the listed 
elements are integral to the initial or on- 
going management of a patient’s current 
or future healthcare. While each 
element is important in the management 
of patients in and of itself, the aggregate 
of the elements elevates the importance 
of clinical information to not only the 
primary provider but for all members of 
the interdisciplinary team involved in 
the patient’s care. The HITECH Act 
statutorily requires the use of health 
information technology in improving 
the quality of health care, reducing 
medical errors, reducing health 
disparities, increasing prevention, and 
improving the continuity of care among 
health care settings. These core set of 
measures are also foundational and 
aligned with each other. For example, 
electronic copies of health information 
given to patient will be useless if it does 
not contain basic information such as a 
problem list, medication list or allergy 
list. Exchange of information to other 
members of the health care team across 
settings will depend on having 
structured data of these elements. 
Therefore, in support of the HITECH Act 
in meeting the statutory requirements, 
we have expanded the core set of 
measures to include these fundamental 
elements to improve patient care. Below 
we list the objectives included in the 
core set of meaningful use objectives. 
—Use CPOE 
—Implement drug to drug and drug 
allergy interaction checks 
—E-Prescribing (EP only) 
—Record demographics 
—Maintain an up-to-date problem list 
—Maintain active medication list 
—Maintain active medication allergy 
list 
—Record and chart changes in vital 
signs 
—Record smoking status 
—Implement one clinical decision 
support rule 
—Report CQM as specified by the 
Secretary 
—Electronically exchange key clinical 
information 
—Provide patients with an electronic 
copy of their health information 
—Provide patients with an electronic 
copy of their discharge instructions 
(Eligible Hospital/CAH Only) 
—Provide clinical summaries for 
patients for each office visit (EP Only) 
—Protect electronic health information 
created or maintained by certified 
EHR 
In addition, achieving Stage 1 
meaningful use means demonstration of 
progress in each of the five healthcare 
outcome priorities outlined in the 
proposed rule and discussed again later 
in this section. Only one of these 
priorities is not represented in the core 
set, population and public health. As we 
have discussed in this section we do not 
want any priority to be overlooked due 
to the flexibility we have added to Stage 
1 of meaningful use; therefore, all EPs 
and hospitals must choose at least one 
of the population and public health 
measures to demonstrate as part of the 
menu set. This is the only limitation 
placed on which five objectives can be 
deferred from the menu set. 
Discussion on Whether Certain EP, 
Eligible Hospital or CAH Can Meet all 
Stage 1 Meaningful Use Objectives 
Given Established Scopes of Practice 
In the proposed rule, we specifically 
encouraged comments on whether 
certain providers may have difficulty 
meeting one or more of the objectives 
due to their provider type or chosen 
specialties 
Comment: We received many 
comments, both general and specific, 
that certain providers or specialists may 
not be able to comply with certain 
objectives because they are beyond the 
scope of their licensing authority or 
because they are outside the scope of 
their standard of practice. For example, 
chiropractors do not have prescribing 
authority and thus may not make use of 
an EHR technology’s e-prescribing 
function and rheumatologists may not 
require information on vital signs. 
While comments on this potential non- 
applicability primarily focused on EPs, 
we did receive comments that some 
objectives may not be relevant to 
smaller or specialized eligible hospitals 
as well. 
Response: We believe the division of 
the meaningful use objectives into a 
core set and a menu set may minimize 
the impact of including among the 
meaningful use objectives one or more 
objectives that certain providers or 
specialists may be unable to satisfy as 
the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH can 
defer five objectives from the menu set. 
However, if the EP, eligible hospital or 
CAH has an insurmountable barrier to 
meeting an objective in the core set or 
a significant number in the menu set 
then the problem remains. For example, 
without any consideration on an EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH’s capability to 
meet the measure associated with a core 
objective any EP that could not order 
medications requiring a prescription 
would not be able to become a 
meaningful EHR user as e-prescribing is 
a core set objective. Similarly, any 
eligible hospital or CAH that did not 
have any requests for electronic copy of 
discharge instructions would not be able 
to become a meaningful EHR user. In 
addition, if this were to occur for a 
significant number of menu set 
objectives, the flexibility for the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH to use the five 
objectives to account for other concerns 
such as implementation struggles or 
workflow process redesign would be 
curtailed. To account for this 
possibility, we have modified each 
objective and measure to indicate when 
there is an option for an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH to report that the 
objective/measure is inapplicable to 
them, because they have no patients or 
no or insufficient number of actions that 
would allow calculation of the 
meaningful use measure. This will 
allow an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
to qualify as a meaningful EHR user 
without being required to meet 
objectives we have specified as 
potentially inapplicable. We note that 
the exclusions to meaningful use 
objectives/measures are specific to each 
objective/measure. In our discussion of 
each specific objective/measure (which 
occurs later in this preamble), we have 
identified specific exclusions where 
they exist. Providers wishing to claim 
that an objective/measure is 
inapplicable to them would need to 
meet the criteria of such an exception. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we have identified, 
for each meaningful use objective, 
whether the EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH may attest that they did not have 
any patients or insufficient actions on 
which to base a measurement of a 
meaningful use for the EHR reporting 
period. For objectives in the core set, 
such an attestation would remove the 
objective from consideration when 
determining whether an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH is a meaningful EHR 
user. In other words, the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH could satisfy the core 
set objectives by satisfying all remaining 
objectives included in the core set. For 
objectives in the menu set, such an 
attestation would also remove the 
objective from consideration when 
determining whether an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH is a meaningful EHR 
user. For example, if for one objective 
included in the menu set an EP attests 
that he or she did not have any patients 
or insufficient actions during the EHR 
reporting period on which to base a 
measurement of a meaningful use 
objective, rather than satisfy 5 of the 10 
meaningful use objectives included in 
the menu set for EPs, the EP need only

EPs Practicing in Multiple Practices 
Another situation where flexibility 
may be needed in order for an EP to 
become a meaningful EHR user is the 
situation where an EP may provide care 
in multiple practices or multiple 
locations. We proposed a policy to 
account for EPs practicing in multiple 
practices and settings. We discussed in 
the proposed rule that we believe it is 
unlikely for an EP to use one record 
keeping system for one patient 
population and another system for 
another patient population at one 
location. We are concerned about the 
application of the measures associated 
with the meaningful use objectives for 
EPs who see patients in multiple 
practices or multiple locations. If an EP 
does not have certified EHR technology 
available at each location/practice 
where they see patients it could become 
impossible for the EP to successfully 
become a meaningful EHR user based on 
the measures associated with the 
meaningful use objectives. We do not 
seek to exclude EPs who meaningfully 
use certified EHR technology when it is 
available because they also provide care 
in another practice where certified EHR 
technology is not available. Therefore, 
we proposed that all measures be 
limited to actions taken at practices/ 
locations equipped with certified EHR 
technology. A practice is equipped if 
certified EHR technology is available at 
the beginning of the EHR reporting 
period for a given geographic location. 
Equipped does not mean the certified 
EHR technology is functioning on any 
given day during the EHR reporting 
period. Allowances for downtime and 
other technical issues with certified 
EHR technology are made on an 
objective-by-objective basis as discussed 
later in this section. We are concerned 
that seeing a patient without certified 
EHR technology available does not 
advance the health care policy priorities 
of the definition of meaningful use. We 
are also concerned about possible 
inequality of different EPs receiving the 
same incentive, but using certified EHR 
technology for different proportions of 
their patient population. We believe that 
an EP would have the greatest control of 
whether certified EHR technology is 
available in the practice in which they 
see the greatest proportion of their 
patients. We proposed that to be a 
meaningful EHR user an EP must have 
50 percent or more of their patient 
encounters during the EHR reporting 
period at a practice/location or 
practices/locations equipped with 
certified EHR technology. An EP for 
who does not conduct 50 percent of 
their patient encounters in any one 
practice/location would have to meet 
the 50 percent threshold through a 
combination of practices/locations 
equipped with certified EHR 
technology. For example, if the EP 
practices at both a Federally Qualified 
Health Center (FQHC) and within his or 
her individual practice, we would 
include in our review both of these 
locations and certified EHR technology 
would have to be available at the 
location where the EP has at least 50 
percent of their patient encounters. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended that 50 percent or more 
of the patient encounters must occur at 
the practice location that receives the 
incentive payment. 
Response: As discussed in section 
II.A.4 of this final rule, an EP may 
assign their incentive payment to other 
practices. We do not believe that 
limiting practices and EPs to only 
considering the location that receives an 
incentive payment provides advantages 
to the program. The requirement 
suggested by commenters would 
potentially cause some EPs not to meet 
the 50 percent threshold even if through 
a combination of practices they may use 
certified EHR technology for far more 
than 50 percent of their patient 
encounters. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification of our proposed 
statement ‘‘Therefore, we proposed that 
all measures be limited to actions taken 
at practices/locations equipped with 
certified EHR technology’’ 
Response: We mean this statement to 
be that as long as an EP has certified 
EHR technology available for 50 percent 
or more of their patient encounters 
during the EHR reporting period they 
only have to include those encounters 
where certified EHR technology is 
available at the start of the EHR 
reporting period. We discuss the 
measures later in this section of the final 
rule, but an illustrative example would 
be the objective of maintain an up-to- 
date problem list. The measure 
associated with this objective is ‘‘More 
than 80% of all unique patients seen by 
the EP or admitted to the eligible 
hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient or 
emergency department (POS 21 or 23) 
have at least one entry or an indication 
that no problems are known for the 
patient recorded as structured data.’’ 
Therefore, if an EP only practices at one 
location or has certified EHR technology 
available at all practice locations then 
the denominator would be all unique 
patients seen during the EHR reporting 
period. However, if an EP practices at 
multiple locations and only has certified 
EHR technology for 80 percent of their 
patient encounters, then the 
denominator is only those unique 
patients seen at locations where 
certified EHR technology is available. 
We reiterate that this is not to account 
for certified EHR technology downtime, 
Certified EHR technology is available at 
a location if it is available at the start of 
the EHR reporting period regardless of 
its actual availability for any given day 
during the EHR reporting period. 
After consideration of the comments 
received, we are finalizing this 
requirement as proposed. 
Discussion of the Burden Created by the 
Measures Associated With the Stage 1 
Meaningful Use Objectives 
Comment: Many commenters 
expressed concerns about the 
difficulties of capturing the 
denominators for the measures that are 
expressed as percentages. They pointed 
out that the formulas in the proposed 
rule would require providers to conduct 
labor-intensive counts of paper 
documents such as prescriptions or 
laboratory results in order to compute 
the denominators of the percentage 
based measures. Some commenters 
suggested that we adopt alternative 
measurement mechanisms, for example 
establishing simple counts of electronic 
occurrences, while others proposed that 
denominators be computed utilizing 
only data collected in the certified EHR 
technology. 
Response: We acknowledge that the 
percentage-based measures, as 
expressed in the proposed rule, would 
create a reporting burden for EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs, and we 
examined a number of alternatives that 
potentially reduce the burden of 
reporting. 
In the proposed rule, we discussed 
the option of counts instead of 
percentages and due to comments 
received have reassessed this option in 
the final rule. This approach clearly has 
the advantage of simplifying the 
process. For example, rather than 
counting the number of prescriptions 
transmitted electronically and then 
dividing by the total number of 
prescriptions, the EP would simply 
need to count the number of 
electronically transmitted prescriptions 
until a benchmark number is passed. If 
the benchmark number is exceeded, 
then the provider meets the measure. 
However, there are several shortcomings 
to this approach. First, we received little 
input from commenters as to where the 
benchmark numbers for the various 
objectives should be set and any 
benchmark set now would not benefit

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
from public comment without 
significantly delaying the Medicare and 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs. (One 
exception was that a number of 
commenters suggested using the PQRI 
measure for e-prescribing, which is the 
generation of at least one eRx associated 
with a patient visit on 25 or more 
unique events during the reporting 
period.) Setting the limit too high would 
disadvantage small providers, since they 
would have smaller patient populations, 
while setting the limit too low would 
create requirements for larger providers 
that would be so limited as to be 
meaningless. A larger provider could 
implement the functionality for a much 
shorter period than the EHR reporting 
period and meet the count. In either 
case, it would be difficult to establish a 
trajectory in later stages that would 
result in meaningful progress being 
made by both small and large providers. 
We then assessed the option of 
limiting the occurrences counted in the 
denominator to those included in the 
provider’s certified EHR technology. As 
an example, if an EP captures 1,000 
prescriptions as structured data in 
certified EHR technology, and 
electronically transmits 500 of these 
prescriptions, the EP’s certified EHR 
technology generated score would be 50 
percent. This approach does simplify 
the computation process, since this 
approach does not have to take into 
account whether some prescriptions 
were not included or included as 
unstructured data in the certified EHR 
technology. However, it does not 
demonstrate the extent to which the 
provider has used the certified EHR 
technology. For example, a provider that 
has captured only 10 prescriptions in 
the certified EHR technology as 
structured data, but writes 1,000 
prescriptions because the provider 
achieved only a limited use of their 
certified EHR technology would also 
score 50 percent by electronically 
transmitting only 5 prescriptions 
according to an automatic report from 
the certified EHR technology. Again, 
this methodology does not lead 
providers toward an upward trajectory 
of both certified EHR technology 
deployment and accomplishment of 
meaningful use. 
We selected a third option, which we 
believe addresses the shortcomings of 
the second option while still preserving 
much of the simplicity of that approach. 
In our approach, we focus on those 
measures whose denominator is not 
based on all patients, but rather a subset 
of patients or actions such as the 
ordering of a lab test or the recording of 
a patient’s request for an electronic copy 
of their discharge instructions. We 
believe that it is reasonable to require an 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to know 
how many unique patients they care for 
in the EHR reporting period and 
therefore maintain that denominator 
where it applies. The maintenance of 
measures using the patient as the 
denominator as encompassing all 
patients ensures a certain level of 
utilization of certified EHR technology 
by the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH. If 
a measure encompassing all patients has 
a threshold of 80 percent, then at least 
80 percent of the patients’ records must 
be maintained using certified EHR 
technology otherwise the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH could not possibly 
meet the threshold. We note a number 
of measures included in the core set 
(such as ‘‘Record Demographics’’ and 
‘‘Maintain an Up-to-Date Problem List’’) 
require an analysis of all unique 
patients, and not just patients whose 
records are maintained in certified EHR 
technology As discussed later the 
thresholds for maintaining an up-to-date 
problem list, medication list and 
medication allergy list are set at 80 
percent. We believe these thresholds 
will create a baseline that ensures that 
EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHS are 
maintain a minimum percentage of 
patient records in certified EHR 
technology, and allows the provider 
community to advance toward the 
longer-term objective of capturing all 
patient data in certified EHR 
technology. For those measures that 
focus on the recording of actions or 
subset of patients to generate the 
denominator, we limit the measures to 
the information for patients whose 
records are maintained in certified EHR 
technology. We offer the following 
examples that relate to the e-prescribing 
and the provision of electronic copy of 
a patient’s health information: 
E-Prescribing Example: An EP orders 
1,000 prescriptions for patients whose 
records are maintained in their certified 
EHR technology and 500 of those are 
transmitted electronically. The EP’s 
denominator is 1,000 prescriptions, the 
numerator is 500 prescriptions, and 
their score is 50 percent. If the EP 
captures all 1,000 prescriptions as 
structured data the calculation could be 
automated by the certified EHR 
technology. If the EP does not capture 
all 1,000 prescriptions as structured 
data than more manual review may be 
required. We would define ‘‘records 
maintained in the certified EHR 
technology’’ to include any patient for 
which sufficient data was entered in the 
certified EHR technology to allow the 
record to be saved, and not rejected due 
to incomplete data. This may be a more 
limited set of data, but an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH would still have to 
have sufficient information in certified 
EHR technology to meet the measures 
associated with Stage 1 of meaningful 
use. For example, an EP might be able 
to save a record with just a patient’s 
name, but as the record would lack any 
information this patient would count in 
the denominator, but not the numerator 
for many objectives. Electronic Copy of 
a Patient’s Health Information Provided 
upon Request Example: An EP 
maintains 1,000 patient records in their 
certified EHR technology. Of those 
patients, fifty make requests for 
electronic copies of their health 
information. The EP provides all of the 
electronic copies within three business 
days. The denominator is 50, the 
numerator is 50, and the EP’s percentage 
is 100 percent. If the EP captures 
requests for information as structured 
data, the calculation could be automated 
by the certified EHR technology. If the 
EP does not capture all the requests as 
structured data then more manual 
review may be required. We will likely 
revisit the methodology in Stage 2, 
where we would expect that at least 
basic EHR functionality has been 
implemented throughout the provider 
enterprise. 
After consideration of public 
comments, we are limiting the following 
objectives and their associated measures 
to patients whose records are 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology. Specific information on 
how to determine inclusion in the 
denominator and numerator is 
discussed in the full discussion of each 
objective later in this final rule.

Discussion on Meaningful Use 
Relationship to Certified EHR 
Technology 
Comment: We received several 
comments requesting more specific 
information of how certified EHR 
technology will accomplish meaningful 
use. Some commenters expressed 
concern that patient clinical outcome 
measurement and improvement was not 
addressed explicitly in the requirements 
of certified EHR technology, but rather 
the requirements focused data entry and 
provision of data electronically. 
Response: One of the main purposes 
of certifying EHR technology is to 
provide the EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH with confidence that the 
technology will not be the limiting 
factor in the achievement of meaningful 
use. As such, all questions of how or 
will certified EHR technology be able to 
accomplish meaningful use broadly or 
at a specific objective level are best 
answered by ONC. CMS and ONC have 
worked closely since the enactment of 
the HITECH Act to ensure certification 
fully supports meaningful use. We 
explicitly link each meaningful use 
objective to certification criteria for 
certified EHR technology. The 
capabilities and standards that are 
certified are those that are used to meet 
the Stage 1 objectives of meaningful use. 
This way we ensure that certified EHR 
technology can accomplish meaningful 
use and meaningful use has the 
intended consequences of improving the 
healthcare priorities that make up 
meaningful use. 
Discussion on the Relationship Between 
a Stage 1 Meaningful Use Objective and 
Its Associated Measure 
Comment: Many commenters pointed 
out gaps between what they believed 
were the anticipated results from an 
objective and the results that are 
measured by the associated measure. A 
particular concern of some of these 
commenters is cases where the 
certification criteria supports the 
measure, but in their view fell short of 
supporting the objective. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
attempted to draw a clear distinction 
between the objective and the associated 
measure. The objectives represent a 
wide range of activities some of which 
are commonplace for EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs using EHRs today, 
while others are ambitious goals even 
for the most sophisticated EHR user of 
today. For some objectives, all aspects of 
the objective are within the control of 
the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH. Other 
objectives rely on electronic exchange 
with partners or external infrastructure 
over which EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs may have little influence and no 
control. We have attempted to 
accommodate these differences when 
we select the Stage 1 measure for a 
given objective. The measure more 
accurately reflects our view of what is 
feasible for Stage 1 than the objective 
itself. The certification criteria 
necessarily reflect more on the measure 
than the objective, as full compliance 
with an objective is beyond the scope of 
what can be accomplished for a 
significant number of EPs, eligible 
hospitals or CAHs in our timeframe for 
Stage 1. This rationale was our assertion 
in the proposed rule as the justification 
for measures that represent less than full 
achievement of their objective. This is 
further supported by some of the 
comments received although for any 
given objective the comments 
addressing that objective were a small 
fraction of the total number of 
comments received and views on how 
much a measure should allow for less 
than full achievement varied widely 
among those commenting. Although we 
received over 2,000 public comments, 
the number of specific comments 
addressing an individual objective were 
relatively small ranging from 40 to 200. 
We reviewed those comments and made 
specific changes to measures in the 
discussion of each objective. We 
reiterate that achievement of the 
measure always equates to achievement 
of the objective for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. We also reiterate that 
certified EHR technology will always be 
able to support achievement of the 
measure by including the necessary 
functionalities. However, as with any 
technology, certified EHR technology is 
only as good as the information it 
contains and getting information into 
certified EHR technology is heavily 
dependent on processes developed by 
the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH. It is 
for this reason that all measures, even 
those for objective whose aspects are 
fully under the control of the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH, represent less 
than full fulfillment of the objective to 
varying degrees. As stated, for 
demonstrating meaningful use and any 
follow up review by CMS or the States, 
successfully meeting the associated 
measure always equates to successfully 
meeting the objective. Updated 
information on the associated measures 
including the numerator, denominator, 
thresholds and exclusions are as 
discussed in the following section. More 
detailed specifications and guidance on 
calculating the measures will be issued 
soon after the publication of this final 
rule. 
As we described in the proposed rule, 
in discussing the objectives that 
constitute the Stage 1 criteria of 
meaningful use, we adopted a structure 
derived from recommendations of the 
HIT Policy Committee of grouping the 
objectives under care goals, which are in 
turn grouped under health outcomes 
policy priorities. We believe this 
structural grouping provides context to 
the individual objectives; however, the 
grouping is not itself an aspect of 
meaningful use. The criteria for 
meaningful use are based on the 
objectives and their associated 
measures. 
We will now review the comments for 
each objective and measure and make 
changes to our original proposal or 
finalize as proposed. 
(1) Objectives and Their Associated 
Measures 
The HIT Policy Committee identified 
as its first health outcomes policy 
priority improving quality, safety, 
efficiency and reducing health 
disparities. The HIT Policy Committee 
also identified the following care goals 
to address this priority: 
• Provide access to comprehensive 
patient health data for patient’s 
healthcare team. 
• Use evidence-based order sets and 
CPOE. 
• Apply clinical decision support at 
the point of care. 
• Generate lists of patients who need 
care and use them to reach out to those 
patients. 
• Report information for quality 
improvement and public reporting. 
As we explained in the proposed rule, 
for the last care goal, the HIT Policy 
Committee proposed the goal as ‘‘Report 
to patient registries for quality 
improvement, public reporting, etc.’’ We 
have modified this care goal, because 
we believe that patient registries are too 
narrow a reporting requirement to 
accomplish the goals of quality 
improvement and public reporting. We 
note that the HIT Policy Committee’s 
recommended objectives include the 
reporting of quality measures to CMS. 
We do not believe that CMS would 
normally be considered a ‘‘patient 
registry’’. We also removed the phrase 
‘‘etc.’’ We believe that the level of 
ambiguity created by ‘‘etc’’ is not 
appropriate for Federal regulations.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
entered by the authorizing provider (for 
example, MD, DO, RN, PA, NP). 
In the proposed rule, we described 
CPOE as entailing the provider’s use of 
computer assistance to directly enter 
medical orders (for example, 
medications, consultations with other 
providers, laboratory services, imaging 
studies, and other auxiliary services) 
from a computer or mobile device. The 
order is also documented or captured in 
a digital, structured, and computable 
format for use in improving safety and 
organization. We said that for Stage 1 
criteria, it will not include the 
electronic transmittal of that order to the 
pharmacy, laboratory, or diagnostic 
imaging center. 
Comment: A majority of commenters 
recommended that EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs be allowed to defer 
CPOE for varying lengths of time 
ranging from 2012 to 2017. The 
commenters cited various reasons for 
deferment including that CPOE is an 
advanced clinical function that typically 
is the last process to be implemented 
due to the need to build the entire 
infrastructure to support the CPOE 
process. Other commenters noted an 
increased burden as if the orders cannot 
be transmitted, then duplicate paper 
orders will have to be produced which 
can lead to patient safety risks. 
Commenters also noted that CPOE 
appears in the latter stages of the 
Certification Commission for Healthcare 
Information Technology (CCHIT) EHR 
implementation process. A minority, 
but significant number of comments 
encouraged CMS to maintain CPOE for 
2011. Those commenters in favor of 
retaining CPOE in 2011 believed that 
CPOE is a basic EHR feature that should 
be a standard offering of a certified EHR 
technology and is critical to improving 
quality of care through audit trails and 
alerting of delinquent order and/or 
delinquent deferred orders. 
Response: We have determined that 
CPOE should be included in the core set 
of measures for Stage 1 in order to 
advance meaningful use. CPOE is a 
foundational element to many of the 
other objectives of meaningful use 
including exchange of information and 
clinical decision support. Many 
commenters, including several 
physician associations, the HIT Policy 
Committee and members of Congress 
through their endorsement of the HIT 
Policy Committee’s recommendation, 
recommended that CPOE be required in 
Stage 1. CPOE has been a major 
initiative of US hospitals for over a 
decade and is a foundational 
functionality to many of the activities 
that further the health care policy 
priorities of meaningful use. For 
example, entering a medication order 
using CPOE allows the EHR to provide 
feedback on whether the medication 
may have adverse reactions with other 
medications the patient is taking. 
Another benefit of CPOE is that greatly 
simplifies the workflow process of 
inputting information into certified EHR 
technology in a structured way to 
populate the patient record. 
Comment: Several commenters asked 
that we further specify who could enter 
the order using CPOE. Some 
commenters stated that only the 
ordering provider should be permitted 
to enter the order. These commenters 
stated that the ordering professional 
needs to be presented with clinical 
decision support at the time of entry 
and that the relay of an order to another 
individual is a source of potential error. 
Other commenters recommended that 
any licensed healthcare professional or 
indeed any individual (licensed or not) 
who receives the order from the 
ordering provider be permitted to 
perform the CPOE. The most common 
argument presented by these 
commenters is that this is currently how 
CPOE is handled in practice and a shift 
to entry by only the ordering provider 
would be too disruptive to workflow. 
Response: We agree with those 
commenters who recommend allowing 
any licensed healthcare professional to 
enter orders using CPOE. We further 
refine this recommendation to be that 
any licensed healthcare professional can 
enter orders into the medical record per 
state, local and professional guidelines. 
While we understand that this policy 
may decrease opportunities for clinical 
decision support and adverse 
interaction, we believe it balances the 
potential workflow implications of 
requiring the ordering provider to enter 
every order directly, especially in the 
hospital setting. We disagree with 
commenters that anyone should be 
allowed to enter orders using CPOE. 
This potentially removes the possibility 
of clinical decision support and advance 
interaction alerts being presented to 
someone with clinical judgment, which 
negates many of the benefits of CPOE. 
Comment: We received requests for 
clarification of this objective and what 
types of orders would meet this 
requirement. 
Response: Our intent in the proposed 
rule was to capture orders for 
medications, laboratory or diagnostic 
imaging. 
However, after careful consideration 
of the comments, we are adopting an 
incremental approach by only requiring 
medication orders for Stage 1. First, this 
supports the objectives of e-prescribing, 
drug-drug and drug-allergy checks. 
Second, this requirement will improve 
patient-safety because of the alignment 
of ordering medications in a structured 
data format will enable providers to 
create registries of patients for potential 
medical recalls, participate in 
surveillance for potential sentinel 
events and life-threatening side effects 
of new medications. Third, other 
measures involving transitions of care 
documents and summary of care 
document will require the entry of an 
active medication list. After 
consideration of the public comments 
received, we are finalizing the 
meaningful use objective for EPs at 
495.6(d)(1)(i) and for eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs at 495.6(f)(1)(i) as ‘‘Use CPOE 
for medication orders directly entered 
by any licensed healthcare professional 
who can enter orders into the medical 
record per state, local and professional 
guidelines’’. 
NPRM EP Measure: CPOE is used for 
at least 80 percent of all orders. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital or CAH 
Measure: For eligible hospitals, CPOE is 
used for 10 percent of all orders. 
In the proposed rule under CPOE, we 
discussed several concepts related to 
any associated measure of any objective 
that relies on a percentage calculation. 
These are the use of a percentage versus 
a count; setting a threshold for measures 
not requiring the electronic exchange of 
information; EPs practicing in multiple 
locations, some of which may not have 
certified EHR technology available, and 
the patient population to which the 
measure would apply. All except the 
last of these received extensive 
comments and are addressed in 
comment and response sections earlier 
in this section. In the proposed rule, we 
said that we would base the measures 
associated with the objectives on both 
the Medicare/Medicaid patient 
population and all other patients as 
well. We said that we believe it is 
unlikely that an EP would use one 
record keeping system for one patient 
population and another system for 
another patient population at one 
location and that requiring reporting 
differences based on payers would 
actually increase the burden of meeting 
meaningful use. We received very few 
comments on this aspect of our 
proposed rule and those that were 
received were generally supportive of 
this proposal. Therefore, we are 
finalizing the policy that all meaningful 
use measures be calculated based on the 
eligible provider’s entire patient 
population (except where otherwise 
noted). 
Comment: Nearly every commenter 
who commented on CPOE objected to 
our proposal to limit this measure to the

inpatient department (Place of Service 
Code 21) for the eligible hospital or 
CAH. Commenters stated that this 
limitation was inappropriate given the 
manner in which hospitals use EHR 
technology. To account for current 
practice, the commenters recommended 
the measures be expanded to include 
the emergency department (ED) (POS 
23). Other reasons cited by commenters 
were that orders begin in the ED and 
remain open as the patient transitions to 
inpatient (for example, infusions), 
transitioning from paper documentation 
in the ED to electronic for subsequent 
care is unsafe as it can result in missed 
information, and/or transcription errors 
as the initial allergies and medications 
are entered into the system, significant 
data collection occurs in the ED that 
would not be included in the system, 
the exclusion of the ED creates 
disincentives to adoption and that the 
ED is a hybrid of temporal and 
functional services that are neither 
purely ambulatory nor inpatient. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters, and therefore are 
expanding this objective and its 
associated measure to the emergency 
room (POS 23). More information on 
place of service codes is available at 
http://www.cms.gov/
PlaceofServiceCodes/. Furthermore, 
given the revision to the HITECH Act 
that changed hospital based eligible 
professionals to include only the setting 
of inpatient and emergency departments 
and all of the benefits of integration of 
these two departments spelled out by 
commenters we will adopt both 
departments when considering the 
measure of eligible hospitals or CAHs 
unless we find there are unique 
circumstances of an objective and its 
associated measure that would preclude 
the inclusion of the emergency 
department for meaningful use. This 
change does not affect the incentive 
payment calculation described in 
section II.B. of this final rule 
Comment: We received several 
recommendations from commenters that 
the requirement of a percentage 
measurement for determining whether 
an EP, eligible hospital or CAH meets 
this objective should be replaced with a 
numerical count for CPOE and many 
other measures associated with 
percentage thresholds. The two main 
reasons given for switching to numerical 
counts are the burden of calculating the 
percentage if it cannot be done 
automatically using certified EHR 
technology and the assertion that if an 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH does 
something a specific number of times it 
can be assumed that it is done often 
enough to constitute meeting the 
objective for Stage 1 of meaningful use. 
Response: We have previously 
discussed the merits of a percentage 
based measure over a count based 
measure earlier in this section under the 
discussion of the burden created by the 
measures associated with the Stage 1 
meaningful use objectives. However, we 
do try to seek a balance reducing the 
burden on providers while still ensuring 
the progression of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. In the next 
comment/response, we discuss changes 
to this measure that respond to concerns 
regarding burden. 
Comment: Many commenters 
representing EPs as well as other 
commenters recommended lowering the 
CPOE threshold for EPs. Those 
commenters representing EPs generally 
recommended parity with eligible 
hospitals at 10 percent, while other 
commenters recommending a reduction 
generally recommended 50 percent. 
Response: With CPOE, we had a 
unique situation of disparate thresholds 
between EPs and hospitals. This was 
due to recommendations prior to the 
proposed rule by the HIT Policy 
Committee. Eligible hospitals were 
granted an even lower threshold for this 
particular requirement. The reason 
given for this recommendation was that 
CPOE is one of the last functionalities 
to be implemented in the hospital 
setting. Commenters point out that 
holds true for EPs as well. As discussed 
above, given the limitations we are 
placing on the numerator and 
denominator for calculating the CPOE 
percentage, we no longer see a 
compelling reason to maintain disparate 
thresholds for the EPs and the eligible 
hospital/CAH. 
Comment: Commenters have 
suggested that our proposal to count an 
action per unique patients could be 
applied to the measure for CPOE as well 
through a revised measure of ‘‘[a]t least 
10% of unique patients seen by the EP 
or admitted to the eligible hospital or 
CAH have at least one order entered 
using CPOE.’’ Commenters also pointed 
to CPOE as an example of a case where 
adequate lead time is necessary to 
implement certified EHR technology. 
Response: At the heart of this new 
basis for this measure is the assumption 
that every patient would have at least 
one order that could be entered using 
CPOE. We believe this is a reasonable 
assumption for EPs, eligible hospitals 
and CAHs. According to analysis of 
25,665 office-based visits in the 2005 
National Ambulatory Medical Care 
Survey, 31 percent of visits included a 
new medication order, and 44 percent 
included at least one refill; 66 percent 
had any type of medication order. 
However, whether a medication order is 
appropriate for every practice could 
vary significantly by scope of practice; 
therefore, for the final rule, we are 
further limiting the denominator to 
patients with at least one medication 
listed in their medication list. We 
believe that this limitation will reduce 
providers’ burden as compared to 
accounting for all orders. To further 
reduce the burden on providers, we also 
will limit the numerator to unique 
patients with at least one medication 
order entered using CPOE. Because we 
have reduced provider burden by 
limiting the denominator and numerator 
as discussed above, we believe that a 
corresponding increase in the CPOE 
threshold is appropriate for hospitals 
and CAHs. For stage 1, we are finalizing 
a threshold for CPOE of 30 percent for 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHS. We 
believe this relatively low threshold, in 
combination with the limitation to only 
medication orders, will allow hospitals 
and EPs to gain experience with CPOE. 
However, as providers gain greater 
experience with CPOE, we believe it is 
reasonable to expect greater use of the 
function. As explained above, we also 
believe CPOE is foundational to many 
other objectives of meaningful use. For 
these reasons, we believe it is 
reasonable to expect providers to move 
to a 60 percent threshold at Stage 2 of 
meaningful use. Thus, for this measure, 
we are finalizing, for Stage 2 of 
meaningful use, that EPs, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs must meet a 60 
percent threshold for CPOE. Therefore, 
we are finalizing a Stage 2 measure for 
CPOE at § 495.6(h) for EPs and § 495.6(i) 
for eligible hospitals and CAHs as ‘‘More 
than 60 percent of all unique patients 
with at least one medication in their 
medication list seen by the EP or 
admitted to the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23) during the 
EHR reporting period have at least 
medication one order entered using 
CPOE’’. 
Comment: We received several 
comments asking for clarification of the 
term unique patient in response to 
various objectives. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
state, ‘‘the reason we propose to base the 
measure on unique patients as opposed 
to every patient encounter, is that a 
problem list would not necessarily have 
to be updated at every visit.’’ To further 
describe the concept of ‘‘unique patient’’ 
we mean that if a patient is seen by an 
EP or admitted to an eligible hospital’s 
or CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23) more than 
once during the EHR reporting period

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
then for purposes of measurement they 
only count once in the denominator for 
the measure. All the measures relying 
on the term ‘‘unique patient’’ relate to 
what is contained in the patient’s 
medical record. Not all of this 
information will need to be updated or 
even be needed by the provider at every 
patient encounter. This is especially 
true for patients whose encounter 
frequency is such that they would see 
the same provider multiple times in the 
same EHR reporting period. Measuring 
by every patient encounter places an 
undue burden on the EPs, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs and may have 
unintended consequences of affecting 
the provision of care to patients merely 
to comply with meaningful use. Given 
the emphasis placed on the reporting 
burden by commenters as described in 
the beginning of this section, we believe 
that our concerns about the burden of 
measurement were well founded. We 
also continue to believe that the use of 
patient encounters could have 
unintended consequences on the 
provision of care by providers. 
Comment: Some commenters asked 
whether the CPOE objective and 
associated measure require transmission 
of the order. Most of these commenters 
were opposed to such transmission in 
Stage 1 for various reasons such as the 
cost of developing interfaces between 
EHRs and laboratory and radiology 
service providers, the volume of 
transmissions would outpace the 
capacity to connect, HIE infrastructure 
is not yet mature enough and the lack 
of the requirement for non-eligible 
entities to participate (for example, 
laboratory vendors, pharmacies). Some 
commenters supported the inclusion of 
the transmission of the order as they 
believed this would provide better 
outcomes than if the transmission was 
not required. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
stated, ‘‘For Stage 1 criteria, we propose 
that it will not include the electronic 
transmittal of that order to the 
pharmacy, laboratory, or diagnostic 
imaging center.’’ While a few 
commenters recommended that this 
objective be changed to require 
transmission, given the large opposition 
to the objective and measure as 
proposed and the reasons commenters 
presented against transmission, it would 
not be responsive to the vast majority of 
commenters to expand this objective 
beyond our proposal. We agree with the 
commenters that said the HIE 
infrastructure is still being developed in 
most parts of the country. Furthermore, 
we note that in the hospital setting, 
most medication orders would not 
require transmission outside of the 
certified EHR technology of the hospital. 
For EPs, we already address 
transmission of the medication order in 
a separate objective for e-prescribing. 
Therefore, we finalize the proposal that 
the transmission of the order is not 
included in the objective or the 
associated measure for Stage 1. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
495.6(d)(1)(ii) of our regulations and for 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs at 
§ 495.6(f)(1)(ii) of our regulations to 
‘‘More than 30 percent of all unique 
patients with at least one medication in 
their medication list seen by the EP or 
admitted to the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23) during the 
EHR reporting period have at least 
medication one order entered using 
CPOE’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(a) for EPs and 45 CFR 
170.306(a) for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. The ability to calculate the 
measure is included in certified EHR 
technology. Thus, for example, an EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH must use a 
certified functionality in entering the 
medication order, and could not use a 
functionality that has been added by the 
EHR vendor, but that is outside the 
scope of the certification. We believe 
this rule is necessary to ensure that the 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH is actually 
making meaningful use of ‘‘certified’’ 
EHR technology, and is not using non- 
certified technology. In addition, 
requiring providers to use 
functionalities that are certified will 
ensure the interoperability of 
information maintained in the EHR as 
providers will be able to operate 
according to consistent standards. We 
believe this standardization and 
consistency is key to realizing the goal 
of using EHR technology to improve 
health care. 
As noted previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives, 
the only patients that are included in 
the denominator are those patients 
whose records are maintained using 
certified EHR technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients with at least one medication in 
their medication list seen by the EP or 
admitted to an eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23) during the 
EHR reporting period 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator that have at least 
one medication order entered using 
CPOE. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 30 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to 
meet this measure. 
Exclusion: If an EP’s writes fewer than 
one hundred prescriptions during the 
EHR reporting period they would be 
excluded from this requirement as 
described previously in this section in 
our discussion whether certain EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH can meet all 
Stage 1 meaningful use objectives given 
established scopes of practices. We do 
not believe that any eligible hospital or 
CAH would have less than one hundred 
prescriptions written for patients 
admitted to their inpatient and 
emergency departments during the EHR 
reporting period. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Implement drug-drug, drug-allergy, 
drug-formulary checks 
In the proposed rule, we did not 
elaborate on this objective. 
Comment: Many commenters 
requested clarification as to what 
formulary the checks would be 
conducted against. 
Response: Ideally, this check would 
be performed against any formulary that 
may affect the patient’s welfare, inform 
the provider as to the best drug to 
prescribe or provide the patient and 
provider information on the drug’s cost 
to both the patient and any third party 
payer. We recognize, however, that not 
every available third party payer, 
pharmacy benefit management, 
preferred drug list is standardized and 
made available for query through 
certified EHR technology. As we cannot 
through this regulation impose such a 
requirement on every developer of a 
formulary, we do not require that an EP/ 
eligible hospital/CAH would have to 
accommodate every formulary in their 
implementation. However, at a 
minimum an EP/eligible hospital/CAH 
must have at least one formulary that 
can be queried. This may be an 
internally developed formulary or an 
external formulary. The formularies 
should be relevant for patient care 
during the prescribing process. To 
further address this, we expect that this 
measure will be expanded to be counted 
on a transactional basis for future stages. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
separating the objective into one 
objective for the clinical checks (drug- 
drug and drug-allergy) and a second 
objective for the administrative check

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
(drug-formulary). The rationale stated 
for the division was that clinical 
measures are focused on preventing 
medication errors versus encouraging 
consideration of cost when prescribing 
medications. In addition, the two types 
involve connections to different kinds of 
resources (drug safety information 
versus formulary information). 
Response: We agree that these should 
be separate objectives for the reasons 
stated by the commenters and split them 
accordingly. 
Comment: We received comments 
that these functions were really part of 
CPOE and electronic prescribing. 
Commenters most commonly noted that 
the drug formulary is part of electronic 
prescribing, as is currently the case 
under the Medicare e-Prescribing 
program. 
Response: While we agree that the 
drug-drug, drug-allergy, drug-formulary 
checks, CPOE, e-prescribing meaningful 
use objectives all serve the same broader 
goal of ensuring accurate ordering and 
prescribing that takes into account all 
available information about the patient 
the functions and their readiness for 
Stage 1 of meaningful use are distinct. 
In terms of functions, CPOE and e- 
prescribing could be performed without 
the drug to drug, drug-allergy or drug- 
formulary checks. Similarly, it is not 
necessary for CPOE or e-Prescribing to 
take place in order for a drug to drug 
allergy check to occur. In terms of 
readiness and ability to measure 
progress for Stage 1 of meaningful use, 
CPOE and e-prescribing both are 
percentage based measures of a distinct 
activity that creates a record even in 
today’s EHR’s and paper patient records. 
The viewing and consideration of 
information presented to the provider 
on possible drug interactions is not a 
similarly distinct activity and does not 
currently create a record. So while the 
goal of these functionalities is similar, 
we believe drug-drug, drug-allergy, 
drug-formulary checks create unique 
concerns for implementation and 
demonstration of meaningful use, and 
therefore we maintain them as separate 
objectives. 
Comments: Several commenters 
expressed concern of ‘‘alert fatigue’’ 
occurring with drug-drug interaction 
checks. Alert fatigue or otherwise 
known as ‘‘pop-up’’ fatigue is a 
commonly perceived occurrence with 
electronic medical records and clinical 
decision support tools in which alerts 
are presented to the user when a 
potential safety issue is identified by the 
system (for example, drug to drug 
interaction). The alerts, while beneficial 
in some cases, can result in a type of 
‘‘fatigue’’ whereby the provider, after 
receiving too many alerts, begins to 
ignore and/or override the alerts. 
Receiving too many alerts can result in 
slowing the provider down rendering 
the alert useless. Commenters 
recommended some changes to the 
objective and associated measure to 
mitigate the risk of ‘‘alert fatigue’’ such 
as limiting the checks for interactions to 
only the most critical medications or 
allowing for adjustment of risk levels 
rather than an on/off functionality. 
Response: We recognize ‘‘alert fatigue’’ 
is a potential occurrence with drug-drug 
and drug-allergy checks. However, 
meaningful use seeks to utilize the 
capabilities of certified EHR technology 
and any means to address alert fatigue 
requires a critical evaluation of each 
alert. We believe this is beyond the 
scope of the definition of meaningful 
use. We believe these checks are 
valuable and improve patient care and 
therefore do not remove them to address 
alert fatigue. 
Comment: Commenters recommended 
food allergies be included in the drug- 
allergy check as some drugs contain 
ingredients that are contraindicated in 
individuals with certain allergies. 
Response: We certainly agree that 
some allergies other than drug can 
interact with drugs; however, as we 
stated under our discussion of the 
objective ‘‘Medication Allergy List’’, the 
ability to identify other types of allergies 
in a useful way are not yet available to 
the extent necessary to require them in 
Stage 1 of meaningful use. This 
certainly does not preclude any EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH from working 
with the designers of their certified EHR 
technology to include this functionality. 
Comment: A commenter requested 
clarification as to whether the drug- 
drug, drug-allergy and drug-formulary 
checks are required for contrast media 
and imaging agents used by radiologists. 
Response: We do not link the checks 
to specific drugs or agents. However, we 
note that is common practice in 
radiology to identify a patient’s past 
drug and food allergies and take 
appropriate interventions if necessary. 
Therefore, the drug-drug, drug-allergy 
and drug-formulary checks would be 
appropriate prior to administration of 
contrast media and imaging agents to 
patients. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(2)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(f)(2)(i) as 
‘‘Implement drug-drug and drug-allergy 
checks.’’ We include this objective in the 
core set as it is integral to the initial or 
on-going management of a patient’s 
current or future healthcare and would 
give providers the necessary 
information to make informed clinical 
decisions for improved delivery of 
patient care. 
In addition, we are finalizing the 
meaningful use objective at for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(1)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(1)(i) of our 
regulations as ‘‘Implement drug- 
formulary checks.’’ 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
The EP/eligible hospital/CAH has 
enabled the drug-drug, drug-allergy, and 
drug-formulary check functionality 
In the proposed rule we discussed 
that the capability of conducting 
automated drug-drug, drug-allergy, and 
drug-formulary checks is included in 
the certification criteria for certified 
EHR technology. This automated check 
provides information to advise the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH’s decisions in 
prescribing drugs to a patient. The only 
action taken by the EP, eligible hospital, 
or CAH is to consider this information. 
Many current EHR technologies have 
the option to disable these checks and 
the certification process does not 
require the removal of this option. 
Therefore, in order to meet this 
objective, an EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH would be required to enable this 
functionality and ensure they have 
access to at least one drug formulary. 
While this does not ensure that an EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH is considering 
the information provided by the check, 
it does ensure that the information is 
available. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received on the objective, we 
believe the measure as proposed 
requires more clarity on the length of 
time for which the functionality must be 
enabled, which we clarify to be the 
entire EHR reporting period. Therefore, 
we are modifying the meaningful use 
measure for ‘‘Implement drug-drug and 
drug-allergy checks for the entire EHR 
reporting period’’ for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(2)(ii) and for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs at § 495.6(f)(2)(ii) of 
our regulations to ‘‘The EP/eligible 
hospital/CAH has enabled this 
functionality for the entire EHR 
reporting period.’’ 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(a). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As this objective only requires that 
functionalities of certified EHR 
technology be enabled, we do not 
believe that any EP, eligible hospital or

CAH would need an exclusion for this 
objective and its associated measure. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received on the objective, we 
are modifying the meaningful use 
measure for ‘‘Implement drug-formulary 
checks’’ for EPs at § 495.6(e)(1)(ii) and 
for eligible hospitals and CAHs at 
§ 495.6(g)(1)(ii) of our regulations to 
‘‘The EP/eligible hospital/CAH has 
enabled this functionality and has 
access to at least one internal or external 
formulary for the entire EHR reporting 
period.’’ 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(b). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
The consideration of whether a drug 
is in a formulary or not only applies 
when considering what drug to 
prescribe. Therefore, we believe that any 
EP who writes fewer than one hundred 
prescriptions during the EHR reporting 
period should be excluded from this 
objective and associated measure as 
described previously in our discussion 
of whether certain EP, eligible hospital 
or CAH can meet all Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives given established scopes 
of practices. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Maintain an up-to-date problem list of 
current and active diagnoses based on 
ICD–9–CM–CM or SNOMED CT® 
In the proposed rule, we described the 
term ‘‘problem list’’ as a list of current 
and active diagnoses as well as past 
diagnoses relevant to the current care of 
the patient. 
Comment: Several commenters noted 
that the coding of problem lists at the 
point of care is outside the normal 
workflow process and would be 
disruptive. 
Response: We did not and do not 
intend that coding of the diagnosis be 
done at the point of care. This coding 
could be done later and by individuals 
other than the diagnosing provider. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
including ICD–10–CM, the Diagnostic 
and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders and explicitly allowing 
subsets of SNOMED CT®. 
Response: We have removed the 
references to specific standards, as we 
believe specifying the relevant 
standards falls within the purview of 
ONC. For ONC’s discussion of this 
functionality and the relevant standards 
including response to the above 
comment, we refer readers to ONC’s 
final rule. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(3)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
at § 495.6(f)(3)(i) of our regulations to 
‘‘Maintain an up-to-date problem list of 
current and active diagnoses’’. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to the initial or on- 
going management of a patient’s current 
or future healthcare and would give 
providers the necessary information to 
make informed clinical decisions for 
improved delivery of patient care. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 80 percent of all unique patients 
seen by the EP or admitted to the 
eligible hospital or CAH have at least 
one entry or an indication of none 
recorded as structured data. 
In the proposed rule, we introduced 
the concept of ‘‘unique patients’’ in the 
discussion of this objective. We received 
many comments requesting clarification 
of this term and address those in the 
comment and response section under 
our discussion of the CPOE measure. 
Comment: A few commenters stated 
that ‘‘None’’ is not a clinically relevant 
term and should be replaced with no 
known problem or no problem. 
Response: Our intent is not to dictate 
the exact wording of the specific value. 
Rather we are focused on the overall 
goal of making a distinction between a 
blank list because a patient does not 
have known problems and a blank list 
because either no inquiry of the patient 
has been made, or problems have been 
recorded through other means. As long 
as the indication accomplishes this goal 
and is structured data, we do not believe 
it is necessary to prescribe the exact 
terminology, thus leaving that level of 
detail to the designers and users of 
certified EHR technology. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the term ‘‘up-to-date’’. 
Response: The term ‘‘up-to-date’’ 
means the list is populated with the 
most recent diagnosis known by the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH. This 
knowledge could be ascertained from 
previous records, transfer of information 
from other providers, or querying the 
patient. However, not every EP has 
direct contact with the patient and 
therefore has the opportunity to update 
the list. Nor do we believe that an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH should be 
required through meaningful use to 
update the list at every contact with the 
patient. There is also the consideration 
of the burden that reporting places on 
the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH. The 
measure, as finalized, ensures the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH has a problem 
list for patients seen during the EHR 
reporting period, and that at least one 
piece of information is presented to the 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH. The EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH can then use 
their judgment in deciding what further 
probing or updating may be required 
given the clinical circumstances. 
Comment: Commenters stated that 
this measure should be replaced with 
either a simple attestation of yes, the 
problem list exists or the percentage of 
the measure should be replaced with a 
count. Alternatively, that the percentage 
should be maintained, but that the 
threshold should be lowered. 
Commenters generally supported this 
lowering of the threshold for one or all 
of the following reasons: It may require 
a change in traditional workflow; 
implementation and rollout of certified 
EHR technology creates unforeseeable 
system downtimes, complications, and 
the required clinical classification 
systems are not geared toward clinical 
information. 
Response: For reasons discussed 
earlier in this section under our 
discussion of the burden created by the 
measures associated with the Stage 1 
meaningful use objectives, we believe a 
percentage is a more appropriate 
measure than those suggested by 
comments. As this objective relies solely 
on a capability included as part of 
certified EHR technology and is not, for 
purposes of Stage 1 criteria, reliant on 
the electronic exchange of information, 
we believe it is appropriate to set a high 
percentage threshold. In the proposed 
rule, we set the percentage required for 
successful demonstration at 80 percent. 
Though full compliance (that is, 100 
percent) is the ultimate goal, 80 percent 
seemed an appropriate standard for 
Stage 1 meaningful use as it creates a 
high standard, while still allowing room 
for technical hindrances and other 
barriers to reaching full compliance. We 
proposed 80 percent for every measure 
with a percentage that met the criteria 
of relying solely on a capability 
included as part of certified EHR 
technology and are not, for purposes of 
Stage 1 meaningful use criteria, reliant 
on the electronic exchange of 
information. Commenters generally 
agreed with this alignment; however, 
they disagreed that 80 percent 
sufficiently allows for ‘‘technical 
hindrances and other barriers’’. 
Commenters have highlighted numerous 
barriers towards successfully meeting an 
80 percent threshold including 
technical barriers, barriers to 
implementation, applicability to all 
patients and all provider types eligible 
for the EHR incentives, patient 
requested exclusions and others. We 
address some of these with specific 
exclusions from the measure as

 44337 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
discussed previously in this section 
under our discussion of whether certain 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH can meet 
all Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
given established scopes of practices. 
Although some technical issues exist, 
recording an up-to-date problem list 
remains largely within the individual 
provider’s control and does not rely to 
a large degree on some external sender 
or receiver of structured electronic 
health data. In addition, there is a 
standard of practice for collecting the 
elements required for an up-to-date 
problem list. Although the commenters 
may be right that some clinical 
workflow needs to change, that is an 
integral part of meaningful use of EHRs. 
Although we do not expect all clinical 
workflow to adapt in Stage 1, there is an 
expectation that the clinical workflow 
necessary to support the Stage 1 priority 
of data capture and sharing will be in 
place in order to effectively advance 
meaningful use of EHRs. In addition, 
given the wide range of activities that 
must occur for meaningful use, we 
believe that most EPs, eligible hospitals 
and CAHs will have fully rolled out the 
capabilities required by this objective 
and the others with an 80 percent 
threshold prior to the start of the EHR 
reporting period thereby reducing the 
likelihood of unexpected system 
downtime and other implementation 
complications. 
For situations in which there is an 
existing standard of practice and 
complying is fundamentally within the 
provider’s control and where the 
objective relies solely on a capability 
included as part of certified EHR 
technology and is not, for purposes of 
Stage 1 criteria, reliant on the electronic 
exchange of information, for the final 
rule, we adopt, the reasonably high 
threshold of 80 percent. We believe 
existing infrastructure and expectations 
support this relatively high target. This 
foundational step of structured data 
capture is a prerequisite for many of the 
more advanced functionalities (for 
example, clinical decision support, 
clinical quality measurement, etc.) for 
which a solid evidence base exists for 
improved quality, safety and efficiency 
of care. Without having most of a 
provider’s up-to-date problem lists in 
structured, electronic data, that provider 
will have major challenges in building 
more advanced clinical processes going 
forward. 
For other situations, where the 
objective may not be fundamentally 
within the provider’s control and is not 
an existing standard of practice, but 
where objective continues to rely solely 
on a capability that is included as part 
of certified EHR technology and is not 
reliant on electronic exchange of 
information, we are setting the 
percentage at 50 percent. This was the 
most commonly recommended 
percentage for these objectives that rely 
solely on a capability included as part 
of certified EHR technology and do not 
rely on the electronic exchange of 
information. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(3)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
at § 495.6(f)(3)(i) of our regulations to 
‘‘More than 80 percent of all unique 
patients seen by the EP or admitted to 
the eligible hospital’s or CAH’s 
inpatient or emergency departments 
(POS 21 or 23) have at least one entry 
or an indication that no problems are 
known for the patient recorded as 
structured data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(c). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients seen by the EP or admitted to 
an eligible hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient 
or emergency department (POS 21 or 23) 
during the EHR reporting period. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who have at least 
one entry or an indication that no 
problems are known for the patient 
recorded as structured data in their 
problem list. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 80 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. 
We do not believe that any EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH would be in a 
situation where they would not need to 
know at least one active diagnosis for a 
patient they are seeing or admitting to 
their hospital. Therefore, there are no 
exclusions for this objective and its 
associated measure. 
NPRM EP Objective: Generate and 
transmit permissible prescriptions 
electronically (eRx). 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification of the term 
‘‘permissible prescription.’’ 
Response: As discussed in the 
proposed rule, the concept of only 
permissible prescriptions refers to the 
current restrictions established by the 
Department of Justice on electronic 
prescribing for controlled substances in 
Schedule II. (The substances in 
Schedule II can be found at http:// 
www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/
orangebook/e_cs_sched.pdf). Any 
prescription not subject to these 
restrictions would be permissible. We 
note that the Department of Justice 
recently released a notice of proposed 
rulemaking that would allow the 
electronic prescribing of these 
substances; however, given the already 
tight timeframe for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use we are unable to 
incorporate any final changes that may 
result from that proposed rule. 
Therefore, the determination of whether 
a prescription is a ‘‘permissible 
prescription’’ for purposes of the eRx 
meaningful use objective should be 
made based on the guidelines for 
prescribing Schedule II controlled 
substances in effect when the notice of 
proposed rulemaking was published on 
January 13, 2010. We define a 
prescription as the authorization by an 
EP to a pharmacist to dispense a drug 
that the pharmacist would not dispense 
to the patient without such 
authorization. We do not include 
authorizations for items such as durable 
medical equipment or other items and 
services that may require EP 
authorization before the patient could 
receive them. These are excluded from 
the numerator and the denominator of 
the measure. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended combining this objective 
and measure with other meaningful use 
objectives such as CPOE or the drug- 
drug, drug-allergy, drug-formulary 
checks 
Response: We addressed these 
comments under our discussion of the 
CPOE objective. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use objective at 
495.6(d)(4)(i) as proposed. 
We have also included this objective 
in the core set. Section 1848(o)(2)(A)(i) 
of the Act specifically includes 
electronic prescribing in meaningful use 
for eligible professionals. This function 
is the most widely adopted form of 
electronic exchange occurring and has 
been proven to reduce medication 
errors. We included this objective in the 
core set based on the combination of the 
maturity of this objective, the proven 
benefits and its specific mention as the 
only example provided in the HITECH 
Act for what is meaningfully using 
certified EHR technology. 
NPRM EP Measure: At least 75 
percent of all permissible prescriptions 
written by the EP are transmitted 
electronically using certified EHR 
technology.

 44338 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
In the proposed rule, we said that 
while this measure does rely on the 
electronic exchange of information 
based on the public input previously 
discussed and our own experiences 
with e-prescribing programs, we believe 
this is the most robust electronic 
exchange currently occurring and 
proposed 75 percent as an achievable 
threshold for the Stage 1 criteria of 
meaningful use. Though full compliance 
(that is, 100 percent) is the ultimate 
goal, 75 percent seemed an appropriate 
standard for Stage 1 meaningful use as 
it creates a high standard, while still 
allowing room for technical hindrances 
and other barriers to reaching full 
compliance. 
Comment: A majority of commenters 
commenting on this measure believe the 
75 percent threshold is too high. Several 
issues were raised to explain why the 
commenters believe the threshold is too 
high. The first is that barriers to e- 
prescribing exist at the pharmacies and 
they must be brought into the process to 
ensure compliance on the receiving end. 
The second represents the most 
common barrier cited by commenters 
and that is patient preference for a paper 
prescription over e-prescribing. A 
patient could have this preference for 
any number of reasons cited by 
commenters such as the desire to shop 
for the best price (especially for patients 
in the Part D ‘‘donut hole’’), the ability 
to obtain medications through the VA, 
lack of finances, indecision to have the 
prescription filled locally or by mail 
order and desire to use a manufacturer 
coupon to obtain a discount. Other 
barriers mentioned by individual 
commenters were the limited 
functionality of current e-prescribing 
systems such as the inability to 
distinguish refills from new orders. 
Suggestions for addressing these 
difficulties were either to lower the 
threshold (alternatives recommended 
ranged from ten to fifty percent) or 
replacing the percentage with a 
numerical count of 25 to align with the 
2010 Medicare e-Prescribing program. 
Of the comments received that 
requested a specific lower threshold, 
about half of them suggested a 50 
percent threshold, and about half 
suggested a threshold of 25 percent to 
30 percent. 
Response: We are finalizing the use of 
a percentage threshold for the reasons 
discussed previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives. In 
the proposed rule, we pointed out that 
we ‘‘believe this is the most robust 
electronic exchange currently occurring’’ 
to justify a high threshold of 75 percent 
given that this objective relies on 
electronic exchange. While we continue 
to believe this is the case, two particular 
issues raised by commenters caused us 
to reconsider our threshold. The first is 
the argument to include pharmacies in 
the Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
incentive programs to ensure 
compliance on the receiving end. Non- 
participation by pharmacies was 
presented by commenters as a major 
barrier to e-Prescribing. The second is 
patient preference for a paper 
prescription. In regards to the first 
argument, we do not have the ability to 
impose requirements on pharmacies 
through the HITECH legislation. 
However, prescriptions transmitted 
electronically have been growing at an 
exponential rate. The number of 
prescriptions sent electronically 
increased by 181 percent from 2007 to 
2008 according to comments received. 
The number of pharmacies is also 
increasing rapidly. Yet this growth is 
uneven across the country and we wish 
to accommodate all EPs and do lower 
the threshold based on this argument. In 
regards to the second argument, we also 
have neither the ability nor the desire to 
limit patient preference. We considered 
allowing an EP to exclude from the 
denominator those instances where a 
patient requested a paper prescription. 
However, the burden of tracking when 
this occurs, the disincentive it would 
create for EPs to work with patients on 
establishing a relationship with a 
pharmacy and the hindrance to moving 
forward with e-prescribing lead us to 
address this through further reduction 
of the threshold as opposed to an 
exclusion. To address these concerns we 
are lowering the threshold for the e- 
prescribing measure to 40 percent. As 
pointed out by commenters, 
e-prescribing it is not yet standard of 
practice and there may be important 
external barriers beyond the provider’s 
control. In particular, for e-prescribing, 
providers are dependent upon an 
external receiver of electronic health 
data, and there are significant variations 
depending on where the provider 
practices. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure at 
§ 495.6(d)(4)(ii) of our regulations to 
‘‘More than 40 percent of all permissible 
prescriptions written by the EP are 
transmitted electronically using 
certified EHR technology’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(b). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As noted previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives, 
the prescriptions in the denominator are 
only those for patients whose records 
are maintained using certified EHR 
technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of 
prescriptions written for drugs requiring 
a prescription in order to be dispensed 
other than controlled substances during 
the EHR reporting period. 
• Numerator: The number of 
prescriptions in the denominator 
generated and transmitted 
electronically. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 40 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. 
As addressed in other objectives and 
in comment response, this objective and 
associated measure do not apply to any 
EP who writes fewer than one hundred 
prescriptions during the EHR reporting 
period, as described previously in this 
section under our discussion of whether 
certain EP, eligible hospital or CAH can 
meet all Stage 1 meaningful use 
objectives given established scopes of 
practices. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Maintain active medication list. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the term ‘‘active 
medication list.’’ 
Response: We define an active 
medication list as a list of medications 
that a given patient is currently taking. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
this objective for EPs at § 495.6(d)(5)(i) 
and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at 
§ 495.6(f)(4)(i) of our regulations as 
proposed. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to the initial or on- 
going management of a patient’s current 
or future healthcare and would give 
providers the necessary information to 
make informed clinical decisions for 
improved delivery of patient care. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 80 percent of all unique patients 
seen by the EP or admitted by the 
eligible hospital have at least one entry 
(or an indication of ‘‘none’’ if the patient 
is not currently prescribed any 
medication) recorded as structured data. 
As with the objective of maintaining 
a problem list, we clarify that the 
indication of ‘‘none’’ should distinguish 
between a blank list that is blank

because a patient is not on any known 
medications and a blank list because no 
inquiry of the patient has been made. As 
long as the indication accomplishes this 
goal and is structured data, we do not 
believe it is necessary to prescribe the 
exact terminology, preferring to leave 
that level of detail to the designers and 
users of certified EHR technology. 
Comment: Commenters stated that the 
measure should be replaced with a 
numerical count or attestation and that 
the threshold was too high for reasons 
including the lack of current electronic 
exchange of information, difficulty 
capturing information as structured data 
and lack of readiness of HIE 
infrastructure. 
Response: We are finalizing the use of 
a percentage for the reasons discussed 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of the burden created by the 
measures associated with the Stage 1 
meaningful use objectives. For the same 
reasons we explained under the 
discussion of up-to-date problem list, 
medication list is a functionality for 
which there is an existing standard of 
practice, it is foundational data capture 
function to make more advanced 
clinical processes possible, and 
complying is fundamentally within the 
provider’s control. Therefore, we 
maintain the reasonably high threshold 
of 80 percent because the existing 
infrastructure and expectations support 
this target. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification as to whether the measure 
is limited to patients seen during the 
EHR reporting period. 
Response: Yes, the measure applies to 
all unique patients seen by the EP or 
admitted to the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
departments (POS 21 or 23) during the 
EHR reporting period. 
Comment: A few commenters 
expressed concern regarding the 
requirement that the entry must be 
recorded as ‘‘structured data.’’ The 
commenters state that there may not be 
a code for over the counter, 
homeopathic or herbal products and 
that would penalize the provider even 
though the data is collected and 
recorded. 
Response: The distinction between 
structured data and unstructured data 
applies to all types of information. 
Structured data is not fully dependent 
on an established standard. Established 
standards facilitate the exchange of the 
information across providers by 
ensuring data is structured in the same 
way. However, structured data within 
certified EHR technology merely 
requires the system to be able to identify 
the data as providing specific 
information. This is commonly 
accomplished by creating fixed fields 
within a record or file, but not solely 
accomplished in this manner. For 
example, in this case for it to be 
structured, if the patient is on aspirin, 
then that information should be in the 
system so that it can be automatically 
identified as a medication and not as an 
order, note, or anything else. An 
example of unstructured data would be 
the word aspirin, but no ability of the 
system to identify it as a medication. 
Comment: A few commenters pointed 
out their current health information 
system vendor does not utilize RxNorm 
as its standard. 
Response: This is a certification issue 
best addressed in the ONC final rule. 
We therefore have referred these 
comments to ONC for their 
consideration. 
Comment: We received comments 
suggesting that this requirement could 
create additional privacy/security 
concerns for patients who do not want 
all physicians and their clinical staff to 
have access to their entire medication 
history. Examples provided included 
antidepressant, antipsychotic or erectile 
dysfunction medications. 
Response: We are only concerned 
with medications that are known to the 
provider through querying the patient, 
their own records and the transfer of 
records from other providers. 
Meaningful use cannot address 
situations where the information is 
withheld from the EP, eligible hospital, 
or CAH by the patient or by other 
providers. We understand that some 
patients would prefer not to have their 
entire medical history available to all 
physicians and clinical staff. We also 
understand that laws in some states 
restrict the use and disclosure of 
information (including that related to 
medication) that may reveal that a 
patient has a specific health condition 
(for example, HIV). Recording data in a 
structured manner will facilitate the 
implementation of these preferences 
and policies in an electronic 
environment. It is easier to identify and 
potentially withhold specific data 
elements that have been recorded in a 
structured format than information 
recorded as free text. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(5)(ii) and for eligible 
hospitals at § 495.6(f)(4)(ii) of our 
regulations to ‘‘More than 80 percent of 
all unique patients seen by the EP or 
admitted to the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
departments (POS 21 or 23) have at least 
one entry (or an indication that the 
patient is not currently prescribed any 
medication) recorded as structured 
data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(d). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients seen by the EP or admitted to 
an eligible hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient 
or emergency departments (POS 21 or 
23) during the EHR reporting period. A 
definition of unique patient is discussed 
under the objective of CPOE. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who have a 
medication (or an indication that the 
patient is not currently prescribed any 
medication) recorded as structured data. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 80 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. Detailed discussion 
of the more than 80 percent threshold 
can be found under the objective of 
maintaining an up-to-date problem list. 
We do not believe that any EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH would be in a situation 
where they would not need to know 
whether their patients are taking any 
medications. Therefore, there are no 
exclusions for this objective and its 
associated measure. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Maintain active medication allergy list. 
Comment: We received comments 
that limiting this list to medication 
allergies instead of all allergies was not 
consistent with efficient workflow and 
that all allergies should be housed in the 
same location within the EHR. 
Commenters also highlighted that lack 
of knowledge of other allergies such as 
latex and food allergies could lead to 
significant harm to the patient. 
Response: We agree that information 
on all allergies, including non- 
medication allergies, provide relevant 
clinical quality data. However, while we 
agree that collecting all allergies would 
be an improvement, current medication 
allergy standards exists in a structured 
data format that may be implemented in 
Stage 1. We hope to expand this 
measurement to include all allergies as 
the standards evolve and expand to 
include non-medication allergies. We 
believe EP/eligible hospitals/CAHs 
should continue to document all 
allergies, regardless of origin, consistent 
with standard of care practice for that 
EP/eligible hospital/CAH. We encourage

them to work with the designers of their 
certified EHR technology to make this 
documentation as efficient and 
structured as possible. 
Comment: A commenter inquired 
why the Substance Registration System 
Unique Ingredient Identifier (UNII) was 
not indicated for use until 2013 yet the 
measure requires the information to be 
recorded as structured data. 
Response: Any standards for the 
structured vocabulary for medication 
allergies or other aspects of meaningful 
use are included in ONC final rule. 
Structured data does not require an 
established standard as discussed under 
the objective of maintaining a 
medication list. 
Comment: We received a few 
comments requesting a definition of 
‘‘allergy.’’ 
Response: We adopt the commonly 
held definition of an allergy as an 
exaggerated immune response or 
reaction to substances that are generally 
not harmful. The definition is derived 
from Medline Plus, a service of the U.S. 
National Library of Medicine and the 
National Institutes of Health. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
495.6(d)(6)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at 495.6(f)(5)(i) as proposed. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to the initial or on- 
going management of a patient’s current 
or future healthcare and would give 
providers the necessary information to 
make informed clinical decisions for 
improved delivery of patient care. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 80 percent of all unique patients 
seen by the EP or admitted to the 
eligible hospital have at least one entry 
(or an indication of ‘‘none’’ if the patient 
has no medication allergies) recorded as 
structured data. 
Comment: Multiple commenters 
noted that ‘‘none’’ is not a typical value 
to describe the absence of allergies in 
medical documentation and should be 
replaced with ‘‘no known allergies 
(NKA),’’ ‘‘no known drug allergies 
(NKDA)’’ or ‘‘no known medication 
allergies (NKMA).’’ 
Response: Our intent is not to dictate 
the exact wording of the specific value. 
Rather we are focused on the overall 
goal of making a distinction between a 
blank list that is blank because a patient 
does not have known allergies and a 
blank list because no inquiry of the 
patient has been made or no information 
is available from other sources. As long 
as the indication accomplishes this goal 
and is structured data, we do not believe 
it is necessary to prescribe the exact 
terminology, preferring to leave that 
level of detail to the designers and users 
of certified EHR technology. 
Comment: Given that the measure is 
only a one time check for a single entry, 
one commenter questioned whether this 
measure truly constitutes maintenance 
of an ‘‘active’’ list. 
Response: We agree that this measure 
does not ensure that every patient under 
the care of every EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH has an active or up-to-date 
medication list. However, not every EP 
comes in contact with the patient, and 
therefore has the opportunity to update 
the list. Nor do we believe that an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH should be 
required through meaningful use to 
update the list at every contact with the 
patient. There is also the consideration 
of the burden that reporting places on 
the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH. The 
measure as finalized ensures that the 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH has not 
ignored having a medication allergy list 
for patients seen during the EHR 
reporting period and that at least one 
piece of information on medication 
allergies is presented to the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH. The EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH can then use their 
judgment in deciding what further 
probing or updating may be required 
given the clinical circumstances at 
hand. Therefore, we are maintaining the 
measure of a one-time check for a single 
entry. 
Comment: Several commenters 
recommended eliminating the 
percentage measurement and allowing 
the provider to attest that active 
medication lists are maintained in the 
certified EHR technology. 
Response: We are retaining a 
percentage for the reasons discussed 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of the burden created by the 
measures associated with the Stage 1 
meaningful use objectives. For the same 
reasons we explained under the 
discussion of up-to-date problem list, 
medication-allergy list is a functionality 
for which there is an existing standard 
of practice, it is foundational data 
capture function to make more 
advanced clinical processes possible, 
and complying is fundamentally within 
the provider’s control. Therefore, we 
maintain the reasonably high threshold 
of 80 percent because the existing 
infrastructure and expectations support 
this target. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(6)(ii) and for eligible 
hospitals at § 495.6(f)(5)(ii) of our 
regulations to ‘‘More than 80 percent of 
all unique patients seen by the EP or 
admitted to the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
departments (POS 21 or 23) have at least 
one entry (or an indication that the 
patient has no known medication 
allergies) recorded as structured data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(e). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients seen by the EP or admitted to 
an eligible hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient 
or emergency departments (POS 21 or 
23) during the EHR reporting period. 
The definition of ‘‘a unique patient’’ is 
provided under the objective of CPOE. 
• Numerator: The number of unique 
patients in the denominator who have at 
least one entry (or an indication that the 
patient has no known medication 
allergies) recorded as structured data in 
their medication allergy list. 
• Threshold: The percentage must be 
more than 80 percent in order for an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH to meet this 
measure. Detailed discussion of the 
rationale more than 80 percent 
threshold can be found at under the 
objective of maintain an up-to-date 
problem list. 
We do not believe that any EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH would be in a 
situation where they would not need to 
know whether their patients have 
medication allergies and therefore do 
not establish an exclusion for this 
measure. 
NPRM EP Objective: Record the 
following demographics: Preferred 
language, insurance type, gender, race 
and ethnicity, and date of birth. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Record the following demographics: 
Preferred language, insurance type, 
gender, race and ethnicity, date of birth, 
and date and cause of death in the event 
of mortality. 
In the proposed rule, we noted that 
race and ethnicity codes should follow 
current federal standards published by 
the Office of Management and Budget 
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/
inforeg_statpolicy/#dr). We maintain 
that proposal for the final rule. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification of whether all of 
the demographics are required and 
under what circumstances no indication 
might be acceptable. Examples of 
acceptable circumstances from 
commenters include patient 
unwillingness to report, language

barriers, and requirement to report 
ethnicity and/or race contrary to some 
state laws. 
Response: In general, we do require 
that all demographic elements that are 
listed in the objective be included in a 
patient’s record in certified EHR 
technology. However, we do not desire, 
nor could we require, that a patient 
provide this information if they are 
otherwise unwilling to do so. Similarly, 
we do not seek to preempt any state 
laws prohibiting EPs, eligible hospitals, 
or CAHs from collecting information on 
a patient’s ethnicity and race. Therefore 
if a patient declines to provide the 
information or if capturing a patient’s 
ethnicity or race is prohibited by state 
law, such a notation entered as 
structured data would count as an entry 
for purposes of meeting the measure. 
Comment: Several commenters asked 
for clarity on the definition of preferred 
language. Commenters also indicated 
that standards are in development (ISO 
639 and ANSIX12N Claim/Reporting 
Transaction). Some commenters also 
requested that we include the 
requirement that the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH also communicate with 
the patient in their preferred language. 
Response: Preferred language is the 
language by which the patient prefers to 
communicate. This is just a record of 
the preference. We do not have the 
authority under the HITECH Act to 
require providers to actually 
communicate with the patient in his or 
her preferred language, and thus do not 
require EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs to do so in order to qualify as a 
meaningful EHR user as suggested by 
some commenters. In regards to 
standards, those would be adopted 
under the ONC final rule. 
Comment: Some commenters also 
requested clarity on the definition of 
race and ethnicity. Some commenters 
noted an Institute of Medicine report 
entitled ‘‘Race, Ethnicity and Language 
Data: Standardization for Health Care 
Quality Improvement’’, which makes 
recommendations for how to ask 
questions to collect information and 
builds on the OMB Standards for 
language, race and ethnicity. Some 
commenters were also concerned about 
situations where the available choices 
were not granular enough, did not 
properly account for mixed race and 
ethnicity, and when the patient did not 
know their ethnicity. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
said that EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs, should use the race and ethnicity 
codes that follow current federal 
standards published by the Office of 
Management and Budget (http:// 
www.whitehouse.gov/omb/inforeg
_statpolicy/#dr). We continue to believe 
that these standards should be applied 
for purposes of implementing the Stage 
1 meaningful use objectives, but will 
consider whether alternative standards 
or additional clarification would be 
appropriate for future stages of 
meaningful use criteria. We believe it is 
beyond the scope of the definition of 
meaningful use to provide additional 
definitions for race and ethnicity 
beyond what is established by OMB. In 
regards to patients who do not know 
their ethnicity, EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs should treat these patients 
the same way as patients who decline to 
provide the race or ethnicity, that is, 
they should identify in the patient 
record that the patient declined to 
provide this information. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested additional clarity on 
insurance type and others 
recommended the elimination of 
insurance type due to the complexity of 
insurance coverage, the function of the 
EHR as a medical tool and not a 
financial one, the volatility of this 
information due to patients frequently 
changing plans and concerns that 
information on a patient’s insurance 
status will have a possible behavioral 
influence on the providers if this 
information were presented. 
Response: Classifying insurance 
involves two distinctions—the source of 
coverage and insurance design. Source 
of coverage refers to the type of funding, 
such as public, private or self-pay. The 
design of the insurance program, such 
as health maintenance program (HMO), 
preferred provider organization (PPO), 
high-deductible consumer directed 
plan, fee-for-service, etc. Although not 
specified in the proposed rule, by 
insurance type we were referring to the 
first distinction—the source of funding 
for the insurance. We found two 
initiatives that could provide clarity on 
type. The first is the ‘‘Source of Payment 
Typology’’ developed by the Public 
Health Data Standards Consortium 
(http://www.phdsc.org/standards/payer- 
typology.asp). The consortium is 
currently in the process of working with 
States to implement this typology. The 
other initiative is established in the 
Uniform Data Set (UDS) collected by 
HRSA (http://www.hrsa.gov/data- 
statistics/health-center-data/ 
index.html). The information in the 
UDS contains several caveats, however, 
that make it difficult to be used by all 
EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs, and it 
does not accommodate patients with 
multiple types of insurance such as 
those dually eligible for Medicare and 
Medicaid or for those with both 
Medicare and MediGap coverage. Many 
EHRs that currently report on HRSA 
UDS Insurance Type standards account 
for multiple types of insurance by 
maintaining separate Reporting 
Insurance Groups and deriving the 
Insurance Type data from the primary 
insurance company on the encounter 
and mappings to that Insurance Type 
Reporting Group. This information is 
documented at the patient demographic 
level or the patient encounter/progress 
note. Given the complexity of defining 
insurance type and attributing it to 
patients in an agreed upon way, we are 
eliminating ‘‘insurance type’’ from this 
meaningful use objective. 
Comment: A minority of commenters 
commenting on this objective 
recommended that CMS remove cause 
of death from the objective for eligible 
hospitals. The most common rationale is 
that the coroner or medical examiner 
officially determines cause of death 
when the case is referred to them. By 
law, the hospital cannot declare a cause 
of death in these cases. 
Response: When a patient expires, in 
the routine hospital workflow, a 
clinician evaluates the patient to 
pronounce the patient’s death. The 
clinician typically documents in the 
patient’s chart, the sequence of events 
leading to the patient’s death, conducts 
the physical exam and makes a 
preliminary assessment of the cause of 
death. We are requiring that eligible 
hospitals record in the patient’s EHR the 
clinical impression and preliminary 
assessment of the cause of death, and 
not the cause of death as stated in any 
death certificate issued by the 
Department of Health or the coroner’s 
office. 
Comment: A few commenters 
requested inclusion of Advanced 
Directives under this objective as 
recommended by the HIT Policy 
Committee. 
Response: We discuss advance 
directives separately in this final rule 
under its own objective. 
Comment: Several commenters 
recommended requiring the submission 
of the demographic data to CMS. 
Response: Stage 1 of meaningful use 
seeks to ensure certified EHR 
technology has the capability to record 
demographic information and that those 
capabilities are utilized. We believe the 
information recorded for this measure is 
for provider use in the treatment and 
care of their patients and therefore 
should not be submitted to CMS at this 
time. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
requiring the use of the demographic 
data from this measure to stratify 
clinical quality measure reporting and

the generation of reports for patient 
outreach and quality initiatives. 
Response: While we encourage all 
providers and EHR developers to work 
together to develop reporting from the 
EHR system for use in the improvement 
of population and public health, for 
purposes of becoming a meaningful EHR 
user in Stage 1, we only require the 
recording of the specified 
demographics. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
meaningful use objective at 
§ 495.6(d)(7)(i) of our regulations for EPs 
to ‘‘Record the following demographics: 
Preferred language, gender, race and 
ethnicity, and date of birth’’. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
meaningful use objective at 
§ 495.6(f)(6)(i) of our regulations for 
eligible hospitals and CAHs to ‘‘Record 
the following demographics: Preferred 
language, gender, race and ethnicity, 
date of birth, and date and preliminary 
cause of death in the event of mortality 
in the eligible hospital or CAH’’. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to the initial or on- 
going management of a patient’s current 
or future healthcare, recommended by 
the HIT Policy Committee and would 
give providers the necessary 
information to make informed clinical 
decisions for improved delivery of 
patient care. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 80 percent of all unique patients 
seen by the EP or admitted to the 
eligible hospital have demographics 
recorded as structured data. 
Comment: Commenters said that this 
should be replaced with a count or 
attestation or alternatively that the 
threshold was too high. 
Response: We are maintaining a 
percentage for the reasons discussed 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of the burden created by the 
measures associated with the Stage 1 
meaningful use objectives. However, we 
do reduce the threshold to over 50 
percent as this objective meets the 
criteria of relying solely on a capability 
included as part of certified EHR 
technology and is not, for purposes of 
Stage 1 criteria, reliant on the electronic 
exchange of information. In contrast to 
our discussion of maintaining an up-to- 
date problem list/medication list/ 
medication allergy list, we believe that 
some demographic elements (especially 
race, ethnicity and language) are not as 
straightforward to collect as objective 
data elements and therefore the 
standard of practice for demographic 
data is still evolving. As we believe this 
measure may not be within current 
standard of practice, we are adopting 
the lower threshold of 50 percent (rather 
than 80 percent). 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(7)(ii) and for eligible 
hospitals at § 495.6(f)(6)(ii) of our 
regulations to ‘‘More than 50 percent of 
all unique patients seen by the EP or 
admitted to the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23) have 
demographics recorded as structured 
data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(c) for EPs and 45 CFR 
170.304(b) for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. The ability to calculate the 
measure is included in certified EHR 
technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients seen by the EP or admitted to 
an eligible hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient 
or emergency departments (POS 21 or 
23) during the EHR reporting period. A 
unique patient is discussed under the 
objective of CPOE. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who have all the 
elements of demographics (or a specific 
exclusion if the patient declined to 
provide one or more elements or if 
recording an element is contrary to state 
law) recorded as structured data. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital or CAH to 
meet this measure. Most EPs and all 
eligible hospitals and CAHs would have 
access to this information through direct 
patient access. Some EPs without direct 
patient access would have this 
information communicated as part of 
the referral from the EP who identified 
the service as needed by the patient. 
Therefore, we did not include an 
exclusion for this objective and 
associated measure. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Record and chart changes in the 
following vital signs: height, weight and 
blood pressure and calculate and 
display body mass index (BMI) for ages 
2 and over; plot and display growth 
charts for children 2–20 years, including 
BMI. 
In the proposed rule, we described 
why we included growth charts in this 
objective. The reason given was that 
BMI was not a sufficient marker for 
younger children. 
Comment: Over two thirds of the 
commenters commenting on this 
objective expressed concern about the 
applicability of the listed vital signs to 
all provider types and care settings. 
Response: While this objective could 
be met by receiving this information 
from other providers or non-provider 
data sources, we recognize that the only 
guaranteed way for a provider to obtain 
this information is through direct 
patient interaction and that this 
information is not always routinely 
provided from the EP ordering a service 
because of a direct patient interaction. 
EPs who do not see patients 2 years or 
older would be excluded from this 
requirement as described previously in 
this section under our discussion of 
whether certain EP, eligible hospital or 
CAH can meet all Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives given established scopes 
of practices. We would also allow an EP 
who believes that measuring and 
recording height, weight and blood 
pressure of their patients has no 
relevance to their scope of practice to so 
attest and be excluded. 
Comment: Several commenters stated 
this objective should be removed in 
favor of clinical quality measures 
addressing BMI and blood pressure as 
these measures serve the same purpose 
and to require both is to require 
duplicative reporting. 
Response: We disagree that these two 
measures serve the same purpose and 
therefore that the measure should be 
eliminated in favor of clinical quality 
measures addressing BMI and blood 
pressure. The objective included here 
seeks to ensure that information on 
height, weight and blood pressure and 
the extractions based on them are 
included in the patient’s record. 
Furthermore, the objective seeks to 
ensure that the data is stored in a 
structured format so that it can be 
automatically identified by certified 
EHR technology for possible reporting 
or exchanging. We also note that the 
clinical quality measure focuses on a 
smaller subset of the patient population. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the objective for EPs at 495.6(d)(8)(i) 
and for eligible hospitals and CAHs at 
495.6(f)(7)(i) as proposed. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to the initial or on- 
going management of a patient’s current 
or future healthcare and would give 
providers the necessary information to 
make informed clinical decisions for 
improved delivery of patient care.

record blood pressure and BMI; 
additionally, plot growth chart for 
children age 2 to 20. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
replacement of the percentage 
measurement with a count or attestation 
or alternatively that that the threshold 
was too high. 
Response: We are retaining a 
percentage for the reasons discussed 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of the burden created by the 
measures associated with the Stage 1 
meaningful use objectives. However, we 
did reduce the threshold from 80 
percent to greater than 50 percent as this 
objective meets the criteria of relying 
solely on a capability included as part 
of certified EHR technology and is not, 
for purposes of Stage 1 criteria, reliant 
on the electronic exchange of 
information. In addition, in contrast to 
the measures associated with 
maintaining an up-to-date problem list, 
an active medication list, and an active 
medication-allergy list, we believe that 
for many specialties, the current 
practice on vital signs may not be as 
well-established. We believe there may 
not be the same level of consensus 
regarding the relevance to patient care 
of vital signs for many specialties and 
the frequency with which such vital 
signs should be collected. Thus, for this 
measure, we adopt a percentage of 50 
percent, rather than 80 percent. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the frequency and 
methods of recording the vital signs 
included in the measure. 
Response: As discussed in the 
objective, the EP/eligible hospital/CAH 
is responsible for height, weight and 
blood pressure so we will focus our 
discussion on those items. First, we do 
not believe that all three must be 
updated by a provider at every patient 
encounter nor even once per patient 
seen during the EHR reporting period. 
For this objective we are primarily 
concerned that some information is 
available to the EP/eligible hospital/ 
CAH, who can then make the 
determination based on the patient’s 
individual circumstances as to whether 
height, weight and blood pressure needs 
to be updated. The information can get 
into the patient’s medical record as 
structured data in a number of ways. 
Some examples include entry by the EP/ 
eligible hospital/CAH, entry by someone 
on the EP/eligible hospital/CAH’s staff, 
transfer of the information electronically 
or otherwise from another provider or 
entered directly by the patient through 
a portal or other means. The measure 
hinges on access of the information. 
Therefore, any EP/eligible hospital/CAH 
that sees/admits the patient and has 
access to height, weight and blood 
pressure information on the patient can 
put that patient in the numerator. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification regarding the role 
of both the EP/eligible hospital/CAH 
and the certified EHR technology for the 
calculation of BMI and the plotting and 
displaying of growth charts. Other 
commenters recommended the 
exclusion of growth charts for certain 
patients and care settings. Another 
commenter also expressed the desire for 
the exclusion of growth charts for 
patients over the age of 18, inpatient 
care settings and more specifically, non- 
pediatric inpatient care settings. 
Response: We believe a clarification is 
in order about which of the listed vital 
signs are data inputs to be collected by 
the EP/eligible hospital/CAH and which 
are calculations made by the certified 
EHR technology. The only information 
required to be inputted by the provider 
is the height, weight and blood pressure 
of the patient. The certified EHR 
technology will calculate BMI and the 
growth chart if applicable to patient 
based on age. As this requirement 
imposes no duty or action on the 
provider, we see no reason to limit its 
availability to any EP, eligible hospital, 
or CAH based on setting or other 
consideration. Concerns on presentation 
and interface are best left to designers of 
certified EHR technology and users. 
Finally, as certified EHR technology is 
able to automatically generate BMI and 
the growth chart if height and weight 
are entered as structured data we see no 
reason to include BMI and growth chart 
in the measure. We therefore will limit 
the final measure to data requiring 
provider data entry points. 
Comment: A few commenters 
suggested that ‘‘reported height’’ by the 
patient should be acceptable when 
measurement is not appropriate such as 
in the case of severe illness. 
Response: We agree and would allow 
height self-reported by the patient to be 
used. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
495.6(d)(8)(ii) and for eligible hospitals 
§ 495.6(f)(7)(ii) of our regulations to ‘‘For 
more than 50 percent of all unique 
patients age 2 and over seen by the EP 
or admitted to eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23), height, 
weight and blood pressure are recorded 
as structured data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(f). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As noted previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives, 
the percentage is based on patient 
records that are maintained using 
certified EHR technology. To calculate 
the percentage, CMS and ONC have 
worked together to define the following 
for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients age 2 or over seen by the EP or 
admitted to an eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23) during the 
EHR reporting period. A unique patient 
is discussed under the objective of 
CPOE. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who have at least 
one entry of their height, weight and 
blood pressure are recorded as structure 
data. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. As addressed in 
other objectives and in comment 
response, an EP who sees no patients 2 
years old or younger would be excluded 
from this requirement as described 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of whether certain EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH can meet all 
Stage 1 meaningful use objectives given 
established scopes of practices. We 
would also allow an EP who believes 
that all three vital signs of height, 
weight and blood pressure have no 
relevance to their scope of practice to so 
attest and be excluded. However, we 
believe this attestation and exclusion 
from recording height, weight, and 
blood pressure does not hold for other 
patient specific information collection 
objectives, like maintaining an active 
medication allergy list. We do not 
believe that any EP would encounter a 
situation where the patient’s active 
medication and allergy list is not 
pertinent to care and therefore would be 
outside of the scope of work for an EP. 
We believe the exclusion based on EP 
determination of their scope of practice 
for the record vital signs objective, as 
written in Stage 1, should be studied for 
relevance in further stages. We do not 
believe eligible hospitals or CAHs 
would ever only have a patient 
population for patients 2 years old or 
younger or that these vital signs would 
have no relevance to their scope of 
practice. Therefore, we do not include 
an exclusion for eligible hospitals or 
CAHs.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Record smoking status for patients 13 
years old or older 
In the proposed rule, we explained 
that we believe it is necessary to add an 
age restriction to this objective as we do 
not believe this objective is applicable 
to patients of all ages and there is no 
consensus in the health care community 
as to what the appropriate cut off age 
may be. We encouraged comments on 
whether this age limit should be 
lowered or raised. We received many 
comments on the age limit and address 
them below. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested a different age limitation. 
Commenters suggested ages anywhere 
between 5 years old up to 18 years old. 
Response: For the purposes of this 
objective and for meaningful use, our 
interest is focused on when a record of 
smoking status should be in every 
patient’s medical record. Recording 
smoking status for younger patients is 
certainly not precluded. We do believe 
there would be situations where an EP/ 
eligible hospital/CAH’s knowledge 
about other risk factors would indicate 
that they should inquire about smoking 
status if it is unknown for patients 
under 13 years old. However, in order 
to accurately measure and thereby 
assure meaningful use, for this objective 
we believe that the age limit needs to be 
high enough so that the inquiry is 
appropriate for all patients. Therefore, 
we are maintaining the age limitation at 
13 years old or older. 
Comment: Some commenters 
suggested expanding smoking status to 
any type of tobacco use. 
Response: While we agree that an 
extended list covering other types of 
tobacco use may provide valuable 
insight for clinical care for certified EHR 
technology ONC has adopted the CDC’s 
NHIS standard recodes for smoking 
status. This will provide a standard set 
of questions across providers and 
standardize the data. The extended list 
does not make the collection of multiple 
survey questions clear. For example, a 
patient may be a current tobacco user as 
well as a smoker. For these reason in 
Stage 1 we will use the standards 
adopted by ONC for certified EHR 
technology at 45 CFR 170.302(g). For 
future stages, we will review this 
measure for possible inclusion of other 
questions. This is a minimum set. We 
do not intend to limit developers of EHR 
technology from creating more specific 
fields or to limit EPs/eligible hospitals/ 
CAHs from recording more specific 
information. 
Comment: We also received 
comments requesting that second-hand 
smoking be included in the objective for 
children and adolescents. 
Response: Including second-hand 
smoking introduces much more 
variability into the objective as to what 
constitutes a level of exposure and 
difficulty in measuring it successfully 
with different age limits to different 
aspects. For instance, how much 
exposure is acceptable for a given age 
and how is such exposure determined? 
How would these differing requirements 
be accounted for by certified EHR 
technology? As with the change from 
smoking status to tobacco use, we 
believe this introduces an unacceptable 
level of complexity for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. For Stage 1 of 
meaningful use we are not adding 
second hand smoke exposure to this 
objective. However, we remind EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs that nothing 
about the criteria for meaningful use 
prevents them from working with their 
EHR developer to ensure that their EHR 
system meets their needs and the needs 
of their patient population. We 
encourage all EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs to critically review their 
implementation in light of their current 
and future needs both to maximize their 
own value and to prepare for future 
stages of meaningful use. 
Comment: We received comments 
asking at what frequency the 
information must be recorded and 
whether the information can be 
collected by support staff. 
Response: We clarify that this is a 
check of the medical record for patients 
13 years old or older. If this information 
is already in the medical record 
available through certified EHR 
technology, we do not intend that an 
inquiry be made every time a provider 
sees a patient 13 years old or older. The 
frequency of updating this information 
is left to the provider and guidance is 
provided already from several sources 
in the medical community. The 
information could be collected by any 
member of the medical staff. 
Comment: We received a number of 
comments recommending either 
removing this objective to record 
smoking status from the HIT 
functionality objectives or removing the 
smoking measure from the core clinical 
quality measures as these measures 
serve the same purpose and to require 
both is to require duplicative reporting. 
Response: We disagree that these two 
measures serve the same purpose and 
therefore only one should be included. 
The objective included here seeks to 
ensure that information on smoking 
status is included in the patient’s 
record. Furthermore, that the 
information is stored in a structured 
format so that it can automatically be 
identified by certified EHR technology 
as smoking status for possible reporting 
or exchanging. We also note that the 
clinical quality measure only focuses on 
patients 18 years or older, while the 
objective focuses on patients 13 years or 
older. In addition, many quality 
measures related to smoking are 
coupled with follow-up actions by the 
provider such as counseling. We 
consider those follow-up actions to be 
beyond the scope of what we hope to 
achieve for this objective for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(9)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
at § 495.6(f)(8)(i) of our regulations as 
proposed. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to the initial or on- 
going management of a patient’s current 
or future healthcare and would give 
providers the necessary information to 
make informed clinical decisions for 
improved delivery of patient care. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 80 percent of all unique patients 
13 years old or older seen by the EP or 
admitted to the eligible hospital have 
‘‘smoking status’’ recorded. 
In the proposed rule, discussion of 
this measure referenced other sections 
exclusively. 
Comment: We received comments 
recommending alternative thresholds 
for this measure. Commenters provided 
thresholds ranging from anything 
greater than zero to 60 percent in stage 
1. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
established a consistent threshold for 
measures not requiring the exchange of 
information. For the final rule, (other 
than up-to-date problem list, active 
medication list and active medication- 
allergy list), we have lowered the 
threshold associated with these 
measures to 50 percent. In our 
discussion of the objective, we noted 
many concerns by commenters over the 
appropriate age at which to inquire 
about smoking status. There were also 
considerable differences among 
commenters as to what the appropriate 
inquiry is and what it should include. 
Due to these concerns, we do not 
believe this objective and measure fit 
into the threshold category described 
under up-to-date problem lists and 
therefore we adopt a 50 percent (rather 
than an 80 percent) threshold for this 
measure. After consideration of the 
public comments received, we are 
modifying the meaningful use measure 
for EPs at § 495.6(d)(9)(ii) and for 
eligible hospitals at § 495.6(f)(8)(ii) of

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
our regulations to ‘‘More than 50 percent 
of all unique patients 13 years old or 
older seen by the EP or admitted to the 
eligible hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient or 
emergency departments (POS 21 or 23) 
have smoking status recorded as 
structured data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(g). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As noted previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives, 
the percentage is based on patient 
records that are maintained using 
certified EHR technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients age 13 or older seen by the EP 
or admitted to an eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
departments (POS 21 or 23) during the 
EHR reporting period. A unique patient 
is discussed under the objective of 
maintaining an up-to-date problem list. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator with smoking status 
recorded as structured data. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. As addressed in 
other objectives, EPs, eligible hospitals 
or CAHs who see no patients 13 years 
or older would be excluded from this 
requirement as described previously in 
this section under our discussion of 
whether certain EP, eligible hospital or 
CAH can meet all Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives given established scopes 
of practices. Most EPs and all eligible 
hospitals and CAHs would have access 
to this information through direct 
patient access. Some EPs without direct 
patient access would have this 
information communicated as part of 
the referral from the EP who identified 
the service as needed by the patient. 
Therefore, we did not include an 
exclusion based on applicability to 
scope of practice or access to the 
information for this objective and 
associated measure. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Record advance directives. 
In the proposed rule, we discussed 
this objective, but did not propose it as 
a requirement for demonstrating 
meaningful use, for a number of reasons, 
including: (1) It was unclear whether 
the objective would be met by 
indicating that an advance directive 
exists or by including the contents of 
the advance directive; (2) the objective 
seems relevant only to a limited and 
undefined patient population when 
compared to the patient populations to 
which other objectives of Stage 1 of 
meaningful use apply; and (3) we 
believe that many EPs would not record 
this information under current 
standards of practice. Dentists, 
pediatricians, optometrists, 
chiropractors, dermatologists, and 
radiologists are just a few examples of 
EPs who would require information 
about a patient’s advance directive only 
in rare circumstances. 
Comment: We received several 
comments including a comment from 
the HIT Policy Committee that we 
should include advance directives in 
the final rule. The HIT Policy 
Committee clarified that this would be 
an indication of whether a patient has 
an advanced directive. Furthermore, 
they recommend limiting this measure 
to patients 65 and older. We received 
other comments that said this should be 
a requirement for eligible hospitals. 
Other commenters reported that having 
this information available for the patient 
would allow eligible hospitals to make 
decisions that were better aligned with 
the patient’s expressed wishes. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
said that confusion as to whether this 
objective would require an indication of 
the existence of an advanced directive 
or the contents of the advance directive 
itself would be included in certified 
EHR technology was one of the reasons 
for not including the objective in Stage 
1 of meaningful use. We expressed 
concerns that the latter would not be 
permissible in some states under 
existing state law. As commenters have 
clarified that advance directives should 
be just an indication of existence of an 
advance directive and recommended a 
population to apply the measure to, we 
reinstate this objective for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs. We believe that the 
concern over potential conflicts with 
state law are alleviated by limiting this 
to just an indication. We also believe 
that a restriction to a more at risk 
population is appropriate for this 
measure. By restricting the population 
to those 65 years old and older, we 
believe we focus this objective 
appropriately on a population likely to 
most benefit from compliance with this 
objective and its measure. This objective 
is in the menu set so if an eligible 
hospital or CAH finds they are unable 
to meet it then can defer it. However, we 
believe many EPs would not record this 
information under current standards of 
practice. Dentists, pediatricians, 
optometrists, chiropractors, 
dermatologists, and radiologists are just 
a few examples of EPs who would only 
require information about a patient’s 
advance directive in rare circumstances. 
For other meaningful use objectives, we 
have focused our exclusions on rare 
situations, which would not be the case 
for this objective. Therefore, we do not 
include this objective for EPs. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are including 
this meaningful use objective for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(2)(i) of 
our regulations as ‘‘Record whether a 
patient 65 years old or older has an 
advanced directive as structured data ’’. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
N/A. 
While we did not receive specific 
percentage recommendations from 
commenters, this objective is the 
recording of a specific data element as 
structured data in the patient record. 
This is identical to other objectives with 
established measures such as, recording 
vital signs, recording demographics and 
recording smoking status. Therefore, we 
adopt the measure format and the lower 
threshold (50 percent) from those 
objectives. We also believe that this 
information is a level of detail that is 
not practical to collect on every patient 
admitted to the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s emergency department, and 
therefore, have limited this measure 
only to the inpatient department of the 
hospital. 
In the final rule, this meaningful use 
measure for eligible hospitals at 
§ 495.6(g)(2)(ii) of our regulations: ‘‘More 
than 50 percent of all unique patients 65 
years old or older admitted to the 
eligible hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient 
department (POS 21) have an indication 
of an advance directive status recorded 
as structured data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.306(h). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As noted previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives, 
the percentage is based on patient 
records that are maintained using

discussed under the objective of CPOE. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator with an indication 
of an advanced directive entered using 
structured data. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for eligible hospital or CAH to meet this 
measure. An exclusion, as described 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of whether certain EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH can meet all 
Stage 1 meaningful use objectives given 
established scopes of practices, would 
apply to an eligible hospital or CAH 
who admits no patients 65 years old or 
older during the EHR reporting period. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Incorporate clinical lab-test results into 
EHR as structured data. 
In the proposed rule, we defined 
structured data as data that has a 
specified data type and response 
categories within an electronic record or 
file. We have revised that definition for 
the final rule as discussed below. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification on what 
constitutes structured data. 
Response: The distinction between 
structured data and unstructured data 
applies to all types of information. 
Structured data is not fully dependent 
on an established standard. Established 
standards facilitate the exchange of the 
information across providers by 
ensuring data is structured in the same 
way. However, structured data within 
certified EHR technology merely 
requires the system to be able to identify 
the data as providing specific 
information. This is commonly 
accomplished by creating fixed fields 
within a record or file, but not solely 
accomplished in this manner. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we finalize the 
meaningful use objective or EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(2)(i) and eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(3)(i) as 
proposed. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 50 percent of all clinical lab 
tests results ordered by the EP or by an 
authorized provider of the eligible 
hospital during the EHR reporting 
period whose results are either in a 
positive/negative or numerical format 
are incorporated in certified EHR 
technology as structured data. 
In the proposed rule, we identified 
this objective and associated measure as 
dependent on electronic exchange and 
therefore requiring special consideration 
in establishing the threshold. We said 
that we are cognizant that in most areas 
of the country, the infrastructure 
necessary to support such exchange is 
still being developed. Therefore, we 
stated our belief that 80 percent is too 
high a threshold for the Stage 1 criteria 
of meaningful use. As an alternative, we 
proposed 50 percent as the threshold 
based on our discussions with EHR 
vendors, current EHR users, and 
laboratories. We then invited comment 
on whether 50 percent is feasible for the 
Stage 1 criteria of meaningful use. 
Finally, we indicated that we anticipate 
raising the threshold in future stages of 
meaningful use as the capabilities of 
HIT infrastructure increase. We received 
several comments on the 
appropriateness of this 50 percent 
threshold and discuss them in the 
comment and response section below. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification as to whether the measure 
includes only electronic exchange of 
information with a laboratory or if it 
also includes manual entry. 
Response: We encourage every EP, 
eligible hospital and CAH to utilize 
electronic exchange of the results with 
the laboratory based on the certification 
and standards criteria in the 45 CFR 
170.302(h). If results are not received in 
this manner, then they are presumably 
received in another form such as fax, 
telephone call, mail, etc. These results 
then must be incorporated into the 
patient’s medical record in some way. 
We encourage that this way use 
structured data; however, that raises the 
concerns about the possibility of 
recording the data twice; for example 
scanning the results and then entering 
the results as structured data. 
Telephoned results could be entered 
directly. We also recognize the risk of 
entry error, which is why we highly 
encourage the electronic exchange of the 
results with the laboratory, instead of 
manual entry through typing, option 
selecting, scanning or other means. 
Reducing the risk of entry error is one 
of the primary reasons we lowered the 
measure threshold for Stage 1 during 
which providers are changing their 
workflow processes to accurately 
incorporate information into EHRs 
through either electronic exchange or 
manual entry. However, for this 
measure, we do not limit the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH to only counting 
structured data received via electronic 
exchange, but count in the numerator all 
structured data. By entering these 
results into the patient’s medical record 
as structured data, the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH is accomplishing a task 
that must be performed regardless of 
whether the provider is attempting to 
demonstrate meaningful use or not. We 
believe that entering the data as 
structured data encourages future 
exchange of information. 
Comment: A majority of commenters 
commenting on this measure believe the 
proposed 50 percent threshold is too 
high. Suggestions for alternative 
thresholds ranged from more than zero 
to eighty percent. Some commenters 
suggested that the percentage 
calculation be replaced with a numeric 
count. 
Response: We are finalizing a 
percentage calculation for the reasons 
discussed previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives. 
We based the 50 percent threshold in 
the proposed rule on our discussions 
with EHR vendors, current EHR users, 
and laboratories and specifically 
requested comment on whether the 50 
percent threshold was feasible. While 
only a small number of commenters 
commented on this objective, those that 
did were overwhelming in favor of 
either a count or a lower threshold. EPs 
especially were concerned with our 
inability to impose any requirements on 
laboratory vendors. Based on the 
comments received, we have modified 
our assessment of the current 
environment for incorporating lab 
results into certified EHR technology, 
and believe that a threshold lower than 
fifty percent is warranted. We want to 
create a threshold that encourages, but 
does not require, the electronic 
exchange of this information and 
commenters indicated that 50 percent 
was too high given the current state of 
electronic exchange of lab results. 
Therefore, we lower the threshold to 40 
percent. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification on what types of 
laboratories could generate the lab 
results. 
Response: The focus of this objective 
is to get as many lab results as possible 
into a patient’s electronic health record 
as structured data. Limiting the 
objective to a specific type of laboratory 
would not further this objective so 
therefore we leave it open to all lab tests 
and laboratories. 
Comment: Several commenters 
expressed concern regarding the 
financial burden of establishing lab 
interfaces, especially for smaller 
hospitals and practices. 
Response: The ability to exchange 
information is a critical capability of 
certified EHR technology. Exchange 
between lab and provider and provider 
to provider of laboratory results reduces 
errors in recording results and prevents 
the duplication of testing. Therefore, we 
continue to include this objective 
within Stage 1 of meaningful use 
although as noted above the measure

does not rely on the electronic exchange 
of information between the lab and the 
provider. 
Comment: We received comments 
requesting a listing of laboratory tests 
with results that are in a numerical or 
positive/negative format. 
Response: We consider it impractical 
to develop an exhaustive list of such 
tests. Moreover, we believe further 
description of these tests is unnecessary. 
It should be self-evident to providers 
when a test returns a positive or 
negative result or a result expressed in 
numeric characters. In these case, the 
results should be incorporated into a 
patient’s EHR as structured data. 
Comment: Several commenters 
pointed out that many current EHR 
vendors do not support the use of 
LOINC® codes and there is no federal 
regulatory requirement for labs to 
transmit using this code set or for that 
matter, any structured code set. 
Response: Standards such as LOINC® 
codes are included in the ONC final 
rule. However, this measure requires 
incorporation of lab test results as 
structured data, but does not include a 
requirement for transmission or 
electronic receipt of the results using 
certified EHR technology.

comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at

authorized provider of the eligible 
hospital or CAH for patients admitted to 
its inpatient or emergency department 
(POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting 
period whose results are in either in a 
positive/negative or numerical format 
are incorporated in certified EHR 
technology as structured data’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(h). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As noted previously in this section 
under our discussion of whether certain 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH can meet 
all Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
given established scopes of practices, 
the percentage is based on labs ordered 
for patients whose records are 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of lab tests 
ordered during the EHR reporting 
period by the EP or authorized 
providers of the eligible hospital or CAH 
for patients admitted to an eligible 
hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient or 
emergency department (POS 21 & 23) 
whose results are expressed in a 
positive or negative affirmation or as a 
number. 
• Numerator: The number of lab test 
results whose results are expressed in a 
positive or negative affirmation or as a 
number which are incorporated as 
structured data. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 40 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. 
If an EP orders no lab tests whose 
results are either in a positive/negative 
or numeric format during the EHR 
reporting period they would be 
excluded from this requirement as 
described previously in this section 
under our discussion of whether certain 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH can meet 
all Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
given established scopes of practices. 
We do not believe any eligible hospital 
or CAH would order no lab tests whose 
results are either in a positive/negative 
or numeric format during the EHR 
reporting period. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Generate lists of patients by specific 
conditions to use for quality 
improvement, reduction of disparities, 
research, and outreach. 
Comment: A few commenters 
recommended eliminating this 
requirement because they believe it is 
redundant of clinical quality reporting. 
Response: We disagree that this is 
redundant of clinical quality reporting. 
Clinical quality reporting does not 
guarantee usability for all the purposes 
in the objective. One example of such a 
use is a provider could not only 
generate list of patients with specific 
conditions, but could stratify the output 
using other data elements in the 
certified EHR technology that are 
entered as structured data. The lists 
could also be utilized at an aggregate 
level for purposes of research into 
disparities, which could result in 
targeted outreach efforts. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested that if we finalize our 
proposal to only require one report that 
we change the ‘‘and’’ in the objective to 
‘‘or’’. 
Response: We are finalizing our 
measurement of only requiring one 
report for Stage 1 of meaningful use and 
will change ‘‘and’’ to ‘‘or’’. However, we 
note that all measures will be 
reconsidered in later stages of 
meaningful use and multiple reports 
could be required in those stages. 
Comment: We received a few 
comments requesting the removal of the 
terms ‘‘reduction of disparities’’ and 
‘‘outreach’’ as there are no actionable 
items or measures associated with the 
term. We also received comments that 
the measurement should include the 
requirement that the lists be stratified by 
race, ethnicity, preferred language, and 
gender for initiatives targeted at 
reducing disparities. 
Response: We disagree that actions to 
reduce disparities or conduct outreach 
could not be guided by this report, 
especially if stratified and aggregated 
reports of many providers are combined 
within large organizations or among 
organizations. While we do not require 
such stratification or aggregation or 
specify specific uses, that does not 
preclude them. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification of the term 
specific condition. 
Response: Specific conditions are 
those conditions listed in the active 
patient problem list. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(3)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
at § 495.6(g)(4)(i) of our regulations to 
‘‘Generate lists of patients by specific 
conditions to use for quality 
improvement, reduction of disparities, 
research, or outreach’’. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Generate at least one report listing 
patients of the EP or eligible hospital 
with a specific condition. 
In the proposed rule, we said that an 
EP or eligible hospital is best positioned 
to determine which reports are most 
useful to their care efforts. Therefore, we 
do not propose to direct certain reports 
be created. However, in order to ensure 
the capability can be utilized we 
proposed to require EPs and hospitals to 
attest to the ability of the EP or eligible 
hospital to create a report listing 
patients by specific condition and to 
attest that they have actually done so at 
least once. We received comments on 
this and address them and any revisions 
to the proposed rule in the comment 
and response section below. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification that only one report per 
EHR reporting period is required to 
meet the measure. 
Response: Yes, only one report in 
required for any given EHR reporting 
period. The report could cover every 
patient whose records are maintained 
using certified EHR technology or a 
subset of those patients at the discretion 
of the EP, eligible hospital or CAH. 
Comment: A few commenters 
suggested the measure should be

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
expanded to require submission of the 
report to CMS or the States or to the 
local health department. 
Response: Submission raises many 
questions about what types of 
information can be sent to different 
entities, how the information is used, 
patient consent for sending the 
information, and many of the issues, 
which add considerable complexity to 
this meaningful use objective. 
Therefore, we are not requiring 
submission of the report to CMS, the 
States or local health departments for 
Stage 1 of meaningful use. We do note 
that this is one of the objectives for 
which a State can submit modifications 
to CMS for approval. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested a list of condition categories, 
a model report or the core data elements 
required to satisfy the measure. 
Response: As stated in the rule, we 
believe an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
is best positioned to determine which 
reports are most useful to their care 
efforts. Therefore, we do not propose to 
direct certain reports be created. 
Comment: For eligible hospitals, 
commenters stated that the analysis of 
patient data is derived from post- 
discharge coding of diagnosis and 
procedures and not problem lists. 
Response: We do not specify that the 
list is limited to being generated from 
the data problem list; rather, for the 
definition of conditions we refer 
providers to those conditions contained 
in the problem list. 
Comment: One commenter stated that 
for privacy and confidentiality reasons, 
patients should be allowed to opt out of 
any provider outreach initiatives. 
Response: Stage 1 of meaningful use 
does not require the submission of these 
reports to other entities; rather, we 
require that the provider generate these 
reports for their own use. We therefore 
do not believe the generation of such 
reports raises privacy and 
confidentiality concerns. We 
understand, however, that some patients 
may have concerns about such lists 
being exchanged with others and will 
consider such concerns should future 
meaningful use requirements focus on 
exchange of these reports. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(3)(ii) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(4)(ii) of our 
regulations as proposed. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(i). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As this measure relies on data 
contained in certified EHR technology 
the list would only be required to 
include patients whose records are 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology as discussed previously in 
this section under our discussion of the 
burden created by the measures 
associated with the Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives. 
We do not believe anything included 
in this objective or measure limit any 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH from 
completing the measure associated with 
this objective, therefore, we do not 
include an exclusion. 
NPRM EP Objective: Report 
ambulatory quality measures to CMS 
(or, for EPs seeking the Medicaid 
incentive payment, the States). 
Specific comments on the quality 
measures are discussed in section II.A.3 
of this final rule. 
We are finalizing this meaningful use 
objective at § 495.6(d)(10)(i) of our 
regulations ‘‘Report ambulatory clinical 
quality measures to CMS (or, for EPs 
seeking the Medicaid incentive 
payment, the States)’’ to better align 
with the descriptions in section II.A.3. 
In response to our revised 
requirements for meeting meaningful 
use, we are including this objective in 
the core set. Section 1848 (o)(2)(A)(iii) 
of the Act specifically includes 
submitting clinical quality measures in 
meaningful use for EPs. Section 
1903(t)(6)(D) of the Act also anticipates 
that the demonstration of meaningful 
use may include quality reporting to the 
States for the Medicaid program. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Report ambulatory quality measures to 
CMS (or, for eligible hospitals seeking 
the Medicaid incentive payment, the 
States). 
We make a technical correction to this 
objective from the proposed rule to 
ensure that it is clear to the public that 
we were referring to hospital quality 
measures. 
Specific comments on the quality 
measures are discussed in section II.A.3 
of this final rule. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
this meaningful use objective at 
§ 495.6(d)(9)(i) to account for our 
technical correction and to better align 
with the descriptions in section II.A.3 as 
‘‘Report hospital clinical quality 
measures to CMS (or, for eligible 
hospitals seeking the Medicaid 
incentive payment, the States)’’. 
In response to our revised 
requirements for meeting meaningful 
use, we are including this objective in 
the core set. Section 1886 (n)(3)(A)(iii) 
of the Act specifically includes 
submitting clinical quality measures in 
meaningful use for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs. Section 1903(t)(6)(D) of the 
Act also anticipates that the 
demonstration of meaningful use may 
include quality reporting to the States 
for the Medicaid program. 
NPRM EP Measure: For 2011, an EP 
would provide the aggregate level data 
for the numerator, denominator, and 
exclusions through attestation as 
discussed in section II.A.3 of this final 
rule. For 2012, an EP would 
electronically submit the measures that 
are discussed in section II.A.3. of this 
final rule. 
Specific comments on the quality 
measures themselves are discussed in 
section II.A.3 of this final rule. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
this meaningful use objective at 
§ 495.6(d)(10)(ii) as proposed. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Measure: For 
2011, an eligible hospital or CAH would 
provide the aggregate level data for the 
numerator, denominator, and exclusions 
through attestation as discussed in 
section II.A.3 of this final rule. For 2012, 
an eligible hospital or CAH would 
electronically submit the measures as 
discussed in section II.A.3. of this final 
rule. Specific comments on the quality 
measures are discussed in section II.A.3 
of this final rule. After consideration of 
the public comments received, we are 
finalizing this meaningful use objective 
at 495.6(f)(9)(ii) as proposed. 
NPRM EP Objective: Send reminders 
to patients per patient preference for 
preventive/follow-up care. 
In the proposed rule, we described 
patient preference as the patient’s 
choice between internet based delivery 
or delivery not requiring internet access. 
We are revising that description based 
on comments as discussed below. 
Comment: Commenters have pointed 
out that requirements to accommodate 
reasonable requests by individuals to 
receive communications by means other 
than the means preferred by the 
provider already exist under HIPAA at 
45 CFR 164.522(b). 
Response: As we stated in the 
proposed rule, patient preference refers 
to the patient’s preferred means of 
transmission of the reminder from the 
provider to the patient, and not 
inquiries by the provider as to whether 
the patient would like to receive 
reminders. In the proposed rule, we had 
proposed that patient preference be 
limited to the choice between internet 
based or non-internet based. In order to 
avoid unnecessary confusion and 
duplication of requirements, EPs meet

the aspect of ‘‘per patient preference’’ of 
this objective if they are accommodating 
reasonable requests as outlined in 45 
CFR 164.522(b), which are the guidance 
established under HIPAA for 
accommodating patient requests. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use objective at 
§ 495.6(e)(4)(i) of our regulations as 
proposed. 
NPRM EP Measure: Reminder sent to 
at least 50 percent of all unique patients 
seen by the EP or admitted to the 
eligible hospital that are 50 and over. 
For the final rule, we are changing the 
measure to recognize that this is an EP 
only objective. Therefore, we make the 
technical correction of striking ‘‘or 
admitted to the eligible hospital’’. 
Comment: Commenters indicated that 
‘‘practice management systems’’ or 
‘‘patient management systems’’ are 
commonly used for this function and 
that integrating them into certified EHR 
technology would be expensive and 
time consuming for little value in 
return. 
Response: While we disagree with 
commenters who suggest there is little 
to no value in having information about 
reminders sent to patients available 
across all the systems used by the 
provider, we do not assert that such 
integration of systems must be in place 
to meet this measure. ONC provides for 
a modular approach that would allow 
these systems to be certified as part of 
certified EHR technology. 
Comment: Some commenters pointed 
out that many patients seen during an 
EHR reporting period will not be sent a 
reminder during that same period. 
Commenters said this is especially true 
for the 90-day EHR reporting period, but 
for some services could be true of the 
full year EHR reporting period as well. 
Other commenters also pointed out that 
reminders are not limited to the older 
population and that children especially 
may require many reminders on 
immunizations. 
Response: We agree with commenters 
that many patients not seen during the 
EHR reporting period would benefit 
from reminders. As the action in this 
objective is the sending of reminders, 
we base the revised measure on that 
action. This focus is supported by 
numerous public comments, including 
those by the HIT Policy Committee. 
Therefore, we are changing the 
requirement to account for all patients 
whose records are maintained using 
certified EHR technology regardless of 
whether they were seen by the EP 
during the EHR reporting period. This 
greatly expanded denominator caused 
us to reconsider both our threshold and 
the age limit. In order to increase the 
probability that a patient whose records 
are maintained in certified EHR 
technology will be eligible for a 
reminder we change the age limit of the 
population to 65 years old or older or 
5 years old or under. We believe that 
older patient populations are more 
likely to have health statuses that will 
indicate the need for reminders to be 
sent and this segment of the population 
is have higher rates of chronic diseases 
which will require coordination in 
preventive care such as vaccine 
reminders. Likewise, the 5 years old and 
under population will require a 
multitude of childhood vaccinations 
such as influenza and will benefit from 
reminders. However, we do not believe 
that changing the age limit of the 
affected population will result in 50 
percent of every patient whose records 
maintained in certified EHR technology 
requiring a reminder during the EHR 
reporting period. This is especially true 
for the first payment year when the EHR 
reporting period is only 90 days. We are 
also concerned about the variability 
among specialists’ scopes of practice 
that may affect the number of patients 
in the denominator for which a 
reminder is appropriate. Therefore, we 
lower the threshold to 20 percent. The 
EP has the discretion to determine the 
frequency, means of transmission and 
form of the reminder limited only by the 
requirements of 45 CFR 164.522(b) and 
any other applicable federal, state or 
local regulations that apply to them. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure at 
§ 495.6(e)(4)(ii) to ‘‘More than 20 percent 
of all patients 65 years or older or 5 
years old or younger were sent an 
appropriate reminder during the EHR 
reporting period’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP 
must use the capabilities Certified EHR 
Technology includes as specified and 
standards at 45 CFR 170.304(d). The 
ability to calculate the measure is 
included in certified EHR technology. 
As noted previously in this section 
under our discussion of the burden 
created by the measures associated with 
the Stage 1 meaningful use objectives, 
the denominator is based on patients 
whose records are maintained using 
certified EHR technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients 65 years old or older or 5 years 
older or younger. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who were sent the 
appropriate reminder. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 20 percent in order 
for an EP to meet this measure. 
As addressed in other objectives and 
in comment responses, if an EP has no 
patients 65 years old or older or 5 years 
old or younger with records maintained 
using certified EHR technology that EP 
is excluded from this requirement as 
described previously in this section 
under our discussion of whether certain 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH can meet 
all Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
given established scopes of practices. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Document a progress note for each 
encounter. In the proposed rule, we 
discussed this objective, but did not 
propose it for Stage 1 of meaningful use. 
We noted our belief that documentation 
of progress notes is a medical-legal 
requirement and a component of basic 
EHR functionality, and is not directly 
related to advanced processes of care or 
improvements in quality, safety, or 
efficiency. 
Comment: We received a limited 
number of comments regarding our 
decision not to include documentation 
of progress notes as an objective. The 
commenters generally fell into three 
categories: Those who supported 
inclusion of this objective in the final 
rule, those who supported its inclusion 
only if certain caveats are met and those 
who supported our proposal not to 
include it as an objective for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. Concerns raised by 
those supporting the inclusion of this 
objective included the possibility that 
an EP may keep paper progress notes in 
conjunction with use of certified EHR 
technology as prescribed by Stage 1 of 
meaningful use and that such a choice 
by EPs would create the possibility of 
handwriting illegibility, loss of 
information and reduced access to 
health information by both patients and 
other providers. Another concern raised 
is that if the objective is not included in 
the criteria for the definition of 
meaningful use designers of EHR 
technology will not include the function 
in their products. The advocates in the 
second category agree with the above, 
but only support inclusion with certain 
caveats. Some of these caveats include 
preserving the option of transcription, 
voice recognition software, and direct 
entry by an EP or any combination of 
these. Another caveat is that progress 
notes not be required to be entered as 
structured data. The third category 
supports exclusion of progress notes as 
an objective for two fundamentally 
different reasons. Some commenters

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
supported exclusion because they 
believe that the volume of objectives 
was already too high for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use and therefore opposed 
anything that would increase the 
volume. 
Other commenters agree with our 
proposal that progress notes is already 
a fundamental part of current EHR 
products and did not represent a move 
that advances the use of EHRs. 
Response: We predicated our 
discussion in the proposed rule on the 
assumption that progress notes are a 
component of basic EHR functionality. 
We still believe this is the case and have 
not received evidence to the contrary. 
However, we failed to clearly articulate 
the ramifications of our belief. Our view 
continues to be that an EP who 
incorporates the use of EHRs into a 
practice and complies with meaningful 
use criteria is unlikely to maintain 
separate paper progress notes outside of 
the EHR system. We believe that the 
potential disruption in workflow of the 
efforts to merge paper progress notes 
with the other records in certified EHR 
technology in order to have a complete 
medical record far outweighs the burden 
of electronically capturing progress 
notes. Moreover, we continue to believe 
this is a highly unlikely scenario. As 
with any meaningful use objective, it is 
important to have clear, definitive 
definitions. However, our observations 
of discussions held in public forums by 
the medical community and review of 
literature have led us to conclude that 
it not possible to provide a clear, 
definitive definition of a progress note 
at this time. We note that commenters 
recommending the documentation of a 
progress note be included as an 
objective did not attempt to define the 
term. Nor did commenters suggest an 
associated measure. We continue to 
believe that there is insufficient need 
and upon review believe there is 
insufficient consensus regarding the 
term progress note to include this 
objective for Stage 1 of meaningful use. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we do not include 
this meaningful use objective in the 
final rule. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
N/A. 
NPRM EP Objective: Implement five 
clinical decision support rules relevant 
to specialty or high clinical priority, 
including for diagnostic test ordering, 
along with the ability to track 
compliance with those rules. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Implement 5 clinical decision support 
rules related to a high priority hospital 
condition, including diagnostic test 
ordering, along with the ability to track 
compliance with those rules. 
First, we make a technical correction. 
On page 1856 of the proposed rule, we 
described this objective for eligible 
hospitals as ‘‘Implement five clinical 
decision support rules relevant to 
specialty or high clinical priority, 
including for diagnostic test ordering, 
along with the ability to track 
compliance with those rules.’’ The 
underlined language was 
inappropriately carried over from the EP 
objective in this instance and in the 
regulation text. The table contained our 
intended language of ‘‘Implement 5 
clinical decision support rules related to 
a high priority hospital condition, 
including diagnostic test ordering, along 
with the ability to track compliance 
with those rules.’’ Many commenters 
pointed this discrepancy out to us and 
we appreciate their diligence. 
Comment: Nearly half of the 
commenters mentioning clinical 
decision support suggested that the term 
needed additional clarification. Some 
commenters said that the term was too 
vague and open to interpretation while 
others said it was too specific. Other 
commenters provided recommendations 
on what a clinical decision support rule 
should mean or which elements it 
should include. These were evidence- 
based medicine templates, decision 
trees, reminders, linked online 
resources, scientific evidence, and 
consensus. 
Response: In the proposed rule, we 
described clinical decision support as 
HIT functionality that builds upon the 
foundation of an EHR to provide 
persons involved in care processes with 
general and person-specific information, 
intelligently filtered and organized, at 
appropriate times, to enhance health 
and health care. We purposefully used 
a description that would allow a 
provider significant leeway in 
determining the clinical decision 
support rules that are more relevant to 
their scope of practice and benefit their 
patients in the greatest way. In the 
proposed rule, we asked providers to 
relate the rules they select to clinical 
priorities and diagnostic test ordering. 
We do not believe that adding a more 
limiting description to the term clinical 
decision support would increase the 
value of this objective. We believe that 
this determination is best left to the 
provider taking into account their 
workflow and patient population. 
Comment: Several commenters 
objected to the requirement of five 
clinical decision support rules when the 
HIT Policy Committee only 
recommended one. Others disagreed 
with our proposed assertion that most 
EPs would report on at least five clinical 
quality measures from section II.A.3 of 
the proposed rule and eligible hospitals 
will all report on at least five. 
Response: We accept the argument 
that there is value in focusing initial 
CDS efforts on a single CDS rule in 
order to get it right the first time and lay 
the foundation for future, broader CDS 
implementation. This will help to 
prevent the unintended negative 
consequences associated with poorly 
implemented CDS systems when 
providers have attempted to do too 
much too soon. 
We agree that the appropriate balance 
is to require some degree of meaningful 
use of CDS in Stage 1 without 
overburdening providers with too many 
areas to focus on at once. Since CDS is 
one area of health IT in which 
significant evidence exists that it can 
have a substantial positive impact on 
the quality, safety and efficiency of care 
delivery, it is important that it be 
included as a core objective with this 
more limited expectation. That 
requirement will assure that all 
meaningful users have taken the first 
steps in CDS implementation but allow 
them to focus as necessary on a single 
high-priority area at the outset in order 
to ensure that they can devote the 
appropriate level of attention to their 
first CDS priority. We anticipate that 
this will set the foundation for much 
more expansive CDS support in the near 
future. 
Comment: A commenter inquired if 
modification of the clinical decision 
support tool negates the EHR’s 
certification status. 
Response: We believe this is a 
question on certification status and is 
outside of the scope of this rule. ONC 
discusses what would affect Certified 
EHR Technology’s certified status in 
their final rule (75 FR 36157) entitled 
‘‘Establishment of the Temporary 
Certification Program for Health 
Information Technology’’. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
495.6(d)(11)(i) to ‘‘Implement one 
clinical decision support rule relevant 
to specialty or high clinical priority 
along with the ability to track 
compliance with that rule.’’ 
After consideration of public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for eligible

with the ability to track compliance

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
We believe that clinical decision 
support is one of the most common 
tools that uses the information collected 
as structured data included in the core 
set and therefore also include clinical 
decision support in the core as the 
information needed to support it are 
already included in the core set. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Implement five clinical decision 
support rules relevant to the clinical 
quality metrics the EP/Eligible Hospital 
is responsible for as described further in 
section II.A.3. of this final rule. 
In the proposed rule, we said that 
clinical decision support at the point of 
care is a critical aspect of improving 
quality, safety, and efficiency. Research 
has shown that decision support must 
be targeted and actionable to be 
effective, and that ‘‘alert fatigue’’ must be 
avoided. Establishing decision supports 
for a small set of high priority 
conditions, ideally linked to quality 
measures being reported, is feasible and 
desirable. Meaningful use seeks to 
ensure that those capabilities are 
utilized. 
Comment: Commenters, both in the 
requests for clarification of the term 
clinical decision support and explicitly 
in response to this measure, expressed 
concern about the linkage to a particular 
quality measure. 
Response: We agree that such linkage 
puts constraints on the provider and 
eliminates many types of clinical 
decision support rules that may be 
beneficial. Therefore, we revise this 
measure to require that at least one of 
the five rules be related to a clinical 
quality measure, assuming the EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH has at least one 
clinical quality measure relevant to their 
scope of practice. However, we strongly 
encourage EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs to consider the clinical quality 
measures as described in section II.A.3 
when deciding which additional rules 
to implement for this measure. 
Comment: Several commenters, 
including the HIT Policy Committee, 
recommended that we focus at least one 
clinical decision support rule on 
efficiency of care. 
Response: In light of decision to limit 
the objective to one clinical decision 
support rule, we do not believe that it 
is appropriate to further to link that rule 
to specific requirements and therefore 
give the EP, eligible hospital or CAH 
discretion on what to focus the clinical 
decision support rule used to satisfy this 
measure. 
Comment: A few commenters asked 
for clarification of how the ‘‘* * * with 
the ability to track compliance with 
those rules’’ language of the proposed 
objective for clinical decision support 
rules relates to the associated measures. 
Response: While an integral part of 
the objective and certified EHR 
technology, we did not include this 
aspect of the objective in the measure 
for Stage 1 of meaningful use. An EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH is not required 
to demonstrate to CMS or the States its 
compliance efforts with the CDS 
recommendations or results for Stage 1 
either at initial attestation or during an 
subsequent review of that attestation. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(11)(ii) and for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(10)(ii) 
to ‘‘Implement one clinical decision 
support rule. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(e) for EPs and 45 CFR 
170.306(c). The ability to calculate the 
measure is included in certified EHR 
technology. 
Given the added flexibility added to 
this measure in the final rule, we do not 
believe that any EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH would be in a situation where they 
could not implement one clinical 
decision support rules as described in 
the measure. Therefore, there are no 
exclusions for this objective and its 
associated measure. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Submit claims electronically to public 
and private payers. 
Comment: Over three quarters of 
those commenting on this objective 
recommended that it be eliminated for 
various reasons. The majority of the 
other commenters requested a 
modification. Reasons given are: 
—Electronic claims submission is 
already covered under HIPAA; 
—Electronic claims submission is not 
part of traditional EHR technology; 
—Billing systems would have to be 
certified adding to cost and burden of 
compliance with meaningful use even 
though when electronic claims 
submission for Medicare is already in 
place for all by the very smallest of 
providers; 
—Electronic claims submission falls 
outside of the scope of the statutory 
mandate given by Congress to 
implement the HITECH legislation to 
improve care delivery through broad 
scale adoption and utilization of 
Electronic Health Record 
technologies. This function does not 
impact the quality of care delivered 
and relies on product components 
that are traditionally part of practice 
management systems; 
—Private payers may customize the 
HIPAA-recognized standard 
transactions, which limits the ability 
of practices to obtain accurate 
information prior to receiving an 
Explanation of Benefits based on the 
actual services provided and negates 
many of the benefits of having 
standardized transactions; 
—Workers’ compensation and auto 
insurers do not accept electronic 
claims; and 
—Many providers use clearinghouses 
and they requested that the burden of 
electronic submission be shifted to 
the clearinghouse. 
Response: In our proposed rule, we 
specifically cite that the existence of 
standard transactions available under 
HIPAA for submitting claims as a reason 
for including this objective as a 
meaningful use objective for Stage 1. We 
also disagree that this objective is 
outside the scope of meaningful use as 
defined by the HITECH legislation. The 
HITECH legislation states the Secretary 
shall seek to improve not only health 
care quality, but also the use of 
electronic health records. In addition, 
we note that sections 1848(o)(2)(A) and 
1886(n)(3)(A) of the Act provide that to 
be considered a meaningful EHR user, 
an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH must 
demonstrate use of certified EHR 
technology in a meaningful manner as 
defined by the Secretary. In the 
Medicaid context, any demonstration of 
meaningful use must be ‘‘acceptable to 
the Secretary’’ under 1903(t)(6). We 
believe this language gives us broad 
discretion to require the use of certified 
EHR technology in a manner that not 
only improves health care quality, but 
results in gains in efficiency, patient 
engagement and enhances privacy and 
security. Under the broad definition of 
electronic health record established by 
ONC in their final rule, electronic 
exchange of eligibility information and 
claims submission could certainly 
improve the use of electronic health 
records. 
We believe that inclusion of 
administrative simplification in 
meaningful use is an important long- 
term policy goal for several reasons. 
First, administrative simplification can 
improve the efficiency and reduce 
unnecessary costs in the health care 
system as a whole; the small percentage 
of paper claims submitted represent a 
disproportionate administrative cost for 
health plans; the reconciliation of 
billing charges for services not eligible 
for payment creates a significant burden 
for providers, health plans, and most

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
significantly, for patients. Second, the 
integration of administrative and 
clinical information systems is 
necessary to support effective 
management and coordinated care in 
physician practices. The ability to 
leverage clinical documentation in 
support of appropriate charge capture 
(for example, for preventive counseling, 
or immunizations provided), the ability 
to link lists of patients needing clinical 
reminders with patient contact 
information, the ability to stratify 
quality measures by patient 
demographic factors (for example, race/ 
ethnicity) and insurer status (for 
example, Medicare beneficiaries), are 
examples. 
In addition, there are important 
benefits to the inclusion of 
administrative transactions in criteria 
and standards for the certification of 
EHR technologies. The option of 
modular certification provides an 
opportunity for eligible professionals 
and hospitals to use practice 
management systems or clearinghouses 
that provide these functions as 
components of their certified EHR 
technologies. However, we recognize 
there is not current agreement as to 
which systems constitute an EHR and 
that many entities may view their 
billing system to be outside their EHR 
and that the vendors of some practice 
management systems that provide these 
functionalities in doctors’ offices today 
may not be prepared to seek 
certification for these legacy products in 
2010/2011. We also recognize that the 
introduction of the X12 5010 standards 
in January 2012 would further 
complicate the certification process for 
stage 1. We also acknowledge that we do 
not have the ability to impose additional 
requirements on third-party payers or 
clearinghouses to participate in this 
exchange beyond what is required by 
HIPAA. Based on these considerations, 
we are not including this objective in 
the final rule for Stage 1 of meaningful 
use. 
However, the introduction of these 
new X12 5010 standards, and the 
coming introduction of ICD–10 in 2013 
provides an opportunity for change in 
Stage 2 of meaningful use. In order to 
meet these and other administrative 
simplification provisions, most 
providers will have to upgrade their 
practice management systems or 
implement new ones. This provides an 
important opportunity to achieve 
alignment of capabilities and standards 
for administrative transactions in EHR 
technologies with the administrative 
simplification provisions that the 
Affordable Care Act provides for health 
plans and health plan clearinghouses. 
We therefore intend to include 
administrative transactions as a part of 
Stage 2 of meaningful use, and expect 
providers and vendors to take this into 
consideration in their decisions leading 
up to 2013. 
Comment: Commenters focusing on 
how meaningful use would translate 
into the Medicare Advantage program 
said that the measure of checking 
eligibility electronically and submitting 
claims electronically for 80 percent of 
patients seen would not be possible. 
They explained that for most of their 
visits, there is no insurance company 
with which to check, and there is no 
insurance company to whom to submit 
claims. They described themselves as a 
capitated system and for most of the 
patient visits, the concept of checking 
eligibility and submitting claims in not 
relevant. 
Response: This comment illustrates 
the difficulties in adopting FFS 
Medicare meaningful use measures for 
qualifying MA organizations, MA- 
affiliated hospitals and MA EPs. For 
purposes of determining meaningful use 
in a Medicare Advantage environment, 
we agree that submitting claims 
electronically is not a useful standard in 
a capitated environment where virtually 
all patients are members of the same 
insurance plan. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are not 
finalizing the objective ‘‘Submit claims 
electronically to public and private 
payers’’. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 80 percent of all claims filed 
electronically by the EP or the eligible 
hospital. 
We received many comments on the 
difficulty in calculating this measure. 
However, as all measures are tied to 
objectives and we do not finalize this 
objective we also do not finalize the 
measure. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Check insurance eligibility 
electronically from public and private 
payers. 
Comment: Over three quarters of 
those commenting on this objective 
recommended that it be eliminated for 
various reasons. Some of the most 
common reasons for elimination are: 
—Electronic eligibility checks are 
already covered under HIPAA; 
—Electronic eligibility checks are not 
part of traditional EHR technology; 
—Billing and practice management 
systems that are used for electronic 
eligibility checks would have to be 
certified as certified EHR technology 
adding to cost and burden; 
—Electronic eligibility checks is outside 
of the scope of the mandate given by 
Congress to implement the HITECH 
legislation in such a way as to 
improve care delivery through broad 
scale adoption and utilization of 
Electronic Health Record 
technologies. This function does not 
impact the quality of care delivered 
and relies on product components 
that are traditionally part of practice 
management systems; 
—Information returned on typical 
electronic eligibility checks is of little 
use to providers—as responses are 
usually a yes/no answer on coverage, 
but not the specificity of coverage; 
—The current poor adoption rate of the 
use of electronic eligibility 
verification is indicative of the 
deficiencies in current methods; 
—Once eligibility checking becomes 
easy to use and reliable, no incentive 
will be required as providers will 
adopt the process readily; 
—Payers do not guarantee their 
eligibility results; 
—Many payers are still not in 
compliance with the HIPAA 270/271 
electronic eligibility standard. 
Therefore the objective should only be 
required if compliance with the 
standard by health plans can be 
guaranteed; and 
—Private payers may customize the 
HIPAA-recognized standard 
transactions, which limits the ability 
of practices to obtain accurate 
information prior to receiving an 
Explanation of Benefits based on the 
actual services provided and negates 
many of the benefits of having 
standardized transactions. 
Response: In our proposed rule, we 
specifically cite the existence of the 
standard transaction for eligibility 
checks available under HIPAA as an 
enabling factor for the inclusion this 
objective. As with the electronic claims 
submission objective discussed above, 
we disagree that this objective is outside 
the scope of meaningful use as defined 
by the HITECH legislation. The HITECH 
legislation requires the Secretary to seek 
to improve not only health care quality, 
but also the use of electronic health 
records. Under the broad definition of 
electronic health record established by 
ONC in their final rule, electronic 
exchange of eligibility information 
could certainly improve the use of 
electronic health records. However, we 
recognize there is not current agreement 
as to which systems constitute an EHR 
and that many entities may view their 
practice management system to be 
outside their EHR. We also acknowledge 
that we do not have the ability to 
impose additional requirements on 
third-party payers to participate in this

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
exchange beyond what is required by 
HIPAA. Third-party payers can provide 
simple yes/no responses, modify the 
standard transactions and do not have to 
guarantee their results. We agree with 
commenters that this significantly 
devalues the results of this objective. 
However, we do believe that as 
electronic records and exchange based 
on this and considerations that 
commenters nearly universally 
considered this to not be a function of 
EHR, we are not including this objective 
in the final rule for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. However, we do believe 
that inclusion of a robust system to 
check insurance eligibility 
electronically is an important long term 
policy goal for meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology and we intend 
to include this objective as well as 
electronic claims submission Stage 2. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are not 
finalizing the objective to ‘‘Check 
insurance eligibility electronically from 
public and private payers’’ or any 
modification thereof. Given that we are 
not finalizing the objective, we also are 
not finalizing the associated EP and 
eligible hospital/CAH measures. 
The second health outcomes policy 
priority identified by the HIT Policy 
Committee is to engage patients and 
families in their healthcare. The 
following care goal for meaningful use 
addresses this priority: 
• Provide patients and families with 
timely access to data, knowledge, and 
tools to make informed decisions and to 
manage their health. 
As explained in the proposed rule, we 
do not intend to preempt any existing 
Federal or State law regarding the 
disclosure of information to minors, 
their parents, or their guardians in 
setting the requirements for meaningful 
use. For this reason, we defer to existing 
Federal and State laws as to what is 
appropriate for disclosure to the patient 
or their family. For purposes of all 
objectives of the Stage 1 criteria of 
meaningful use involving the disclosure 
of information to a patient, a disclosure 
made to a family member or a patient’s 
guardian consistent with Federal and 
State law may substitute for a disclosure 
to the patient. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that all objectives under the 
health care policy priority be combined, 
as they are redundant. 
Response: We disagree that they are 
redundant and believe each serves a 
unique purpose. We will more fully 
describe those purposes in the 
discussion of each objective. 
NPRM EP Objective: Provide patients 
with an electronic copy of their health 
information (including diagnostics test 
results, problem list, medication lists, 
allergies) upon request. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Provide patients with an electronic copy 
of their health information (including 
diagnostic test results, problem list, 
medication lists, allergies, discharge 
summary, procedures), upon request 
The purpose of this objective is to 
provide a patient’s health information to 
them electronically and in a human 
readable format and in accordance with 
the standards specified in the ONC final 
rule subject to its availability to the 
provider electronically and any 
withholding under regulations related to 
the HIPAA Privacy Act at 45 CFR 
164.524, Access of individuals to 
protected health information. 
In the proposed rule, we indicated 
that electronic copies may be provided 
through a number of secure electronic 
methods (for example, personal health 
record (PHR), patient portal, CD, USB 
drive). We have changed this 
description in response to comments to 
that when responding to patient 
requests for information, the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH should accommodate 
patient requests in accordance with 45 
CFR 164.524, Access of individuals to 
protected health information. The 
objective provides additional criteria for 
meeting meaningful use concerning the 
electronic copy or provision of 
information that the EP, eligible hospital 
or CAH maintains in or can access from 
the certified EHR technology and is 
maintained by or on behalf of the EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH. 
Comment: We received requests for 
clarification that only information that 
the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH has 
available electronically must be 
provided to the patient. 
Response: Yes, we limit the 
information that must be provided 
electronically to that information that 
exists electronically in or accessible 
from the certified EHR technology and 
is maintained by or on behalf of the EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH. We believe it 
is impractical to require information 
maintained on paper to be transmitted 
electronically. Furthermore, given the 
other criteria of Stage 1 of meaningful 
use, we believe sufficient information 
will be available through certified EHR 
technology, especially given the 
inclusion of many of the foundational 
objectives that were included in the core 
set. 
Comment: Commenters pointed out 
that the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits 
licensed healthcare professionals to 
withhold certain information if its 
disclosure would cause substantial 
harm to the patient or another 
individual. 
Response: As previously discussed for 
patient preference, we do not seek to 
conflict with or override HIPAA through 
meaningful use requirements. Therefore, 
an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH may 
withhold information from the 
electronic copy of a patient’s health 
information in accordance with the 
regulations at 45 CFR 164.524, Access of 
individuals to protected health 
information. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the term ‘‘health 
information’’ or alternatively a list of 
elements required to satisfy the 
objective. 
Response: Subject to the withholding 
described above, an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH should provide a 
patient with all of the health 
information they have available 
electronically. At a minimum, this 
would include the elements listed in the 
ONC final rule at 45 CFR 170.304(f) for 
EPs and 45 CFR 170.306(d) for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs as required for EHR 
technology to become certified. 
Comment: Several commenters 
indicated that a provider should be 
allowed to charge a fee for providing an 
electronic copy of a patient’s health 
information. 
Response: We do not have the 
authority under the HITECH Act to 
regulate fees in this manner. Rather, the 
charging of fees for this information is 
governed by the HIPAA Privacy Rule at 
45 CFR 164.524(c)(4) (which only 
permits HIPAA covered entities to 
charge an individual a reasonable, cost- 
based fee for a copy of the individual’s 
health information). We would expect 
these costs to be very minimal 
considering that the ability to generate 
the copy is included in certified EHR 
technology. Additional clarification on 
the fee that a HIPAA covered entity may 
impose on an individual for an 
electronic copy of the individual’s 
health information will be addressed in 
upcoming rulemaking. 
Comment: Commenters pointed out 
that the general term ‘‘allergies’’ is 
inconsistent with other objectives of 
Stage 1 and with the capabilities 
mandated by certification under the 
ONC IFR, which address only 
medication allergies. 
Response: As we have stated on 
several other objectives, we encourage 
all EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to 
work with their EHR technology 
designers to make capabilities most 
relevant to their individual practices of 
care. However, we have maintained that 
at a minimum the capabilities that are 
part of certification should be included

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
and those should be the basis for 
meaningful use so we do modify this 
objective to medication allergies to align 
it with other objectives and certification. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(12)(i) of our regulations to 
‘‘Provide patients with an electronic 
copy of their health information 
(including diagnostics test results, 
problem list, medication lists, 
medication allergies) upon request’’ and 
for eligible hospitals and CAHs at 
§ 495.6(f)(11)(i) of our regulations to 
‘‘Provide patients with an electronic 
copy of their health information 
(including diagnostic test results, 
problem list, medication lists, 
medication allergies, discharge 
summary, procedures), upon request’’. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to involving patients 
and their families in their provision of 
care and was recommended by the HIT 
Policy Committee for inclusion in the 
core set. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
At least 80 percent of all patients who 
request an electronic copy of their 
health information are provided it 
within 48 hours. 
In the proposed rule, we pointed out 
that all patients have a right under 
ARRA to an electronic copy of their 
health information. We said that our 
purpose for including it in meaningful 
use was to ensure that this requirement 
in met in a timely fashion. We also said 
that providing patients with an 
electronic copy of their health 
information demonstrates one of the 
many benefits health information 
technology can provide and we believe 
that it is an important part of becoming 
a meaningful EHR user. We received 
requests for clarifications on what must 
be provided and in what timeframe. We 
address those requests in the comment 
and response section below. We note 
here that participation in the Medicare 
and Medicaid EHR incentive programs 
is voluntary. Nothing in the Stage 1 
criteria of meaningful use supersedes or 
exempts an EP, eligible hospital or CAH 
from complying with otherwise 
applicable requirements to provide 
patients with their health information. 
Comment: An overwhelming majority 
of commenters commenting on this 
objective indicated that the 48-hour 
time frame is too short and inconsistent 
with the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 
Response: We discuss the reasoning 
for the time frame in the proposed rule. 
We state that this measure seeks to 
ensure that a patient’s request is met in 
a timely fashion. Providing patients 
with an electronic copy of their health 
information demonstrates one of the 
many benefits health information 
technology can provide. We also believe 
that certified EHR technology will 
provide EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs more efficient means of providing 
copies of health information to patients, 
which is why we proposed that a 
request for an electronic copy be 
provided to the patient within 48 hours. 
In the final rule, we further point out 
that this objective is limited to health 
information maintained and provided 
electronically while HIPAA can require 
the retrieval, copying and mailing of 
paper documents. For this reason, we do 
not believe the timeframes under this 
meaningful use objective and the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule must be aligned. 
However, we appreciate that the 48- 
hour timeframe may be burdensome for 
some providers, particularly for those 
providers who do not operate 24/7. We 
therefore are lengthening the timeframe 
to three business days. Business days 
are defined as Monday through Friday 
excluding federal or state holidays on 
which the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
or their respective administrative staffs 
are unavailable. As an example if a 
patient made a request for an electronic 
copy of their health information on 
Monday then the EP, eligible hospital, 
or CAH would have until the same time 
on Thursday to provide the information 
assuming there were no intervening 
holidays. If provision of the copy 
involves the mailing of physical 
electronic media, then it would need to 
be mailed on the Thursday. 
Comment: Some commenters believed 
the 80 percent threshold was too high or 
introduced examples of extraordinary 
circumstances such as natural disasters 
or system crashes that would indicate a 
lower threshold is needed to 
accommodate them. 
Response: We reduce the threshold to 
over 50 percent as this objective meets 
the criteria of relying solely on a 
capability included as part of certified 
EHR technology and is not, for purposes 
of Stage 1 criteria, reliant on the 
electronic exchange of information, as 
explained under our discussion of the 
objective of maintain an up-to-date 
problem list. As this is a relatively new 
capability that was not available to 
either providers or patients before the 
introduction of EHRs, we do not believe 
it meets the same standard of practice as 
maintaining an up-to-date problem list 
and therefore adopt a threshold of 50 
percent (rather than 80 percent). 
Comment: We received comments 
that were concerned about the reporting 
burden of this requirement. 
Response: We believe that as long as 
the request by the patient is accurately 
recorded in the certified EHR 
technology then the certified EHR 
technology should be able to calculate 
the measure. Recording patient requests 
for certain actions should be part of the 
expectations of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. If the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH records the 
requests using certified EHR technology, 
certified EHR technology will be able to 
assist in calculating both the numerator 
and denominator. If the requests are 
recorded by another means at the choice 
of the provider, the provider would be 
responsible for determining the 
denominator. 
Comment: Commenters inquired if 
third-party requests for information are 
included in the denominator. 
Response: Only specific third party 
requests for information are included in 
the denominator. As we stated in the 
opening discussion for this health care 
priority, providing the copy to a family 
member or patient’s authorized 
representative consistent with federal 
and state law may substitute for a 
disclosure of the information to the 
patient and count in the numerator. A 
request from the same would count in 
the denominator. All other third party 
requests are not included in the 
numerator or the denominator. 
Comment: Commenters inquired if 
asking the patient to register for their 
own personal health record (PHR) 
satisfies the intent of the objective. 
Response: EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs are to provide the information 
pursuant to the reasonable 
accommodations for patient preference 
under 45 CFR164.522(b). To be included 
in this measure, the patient has already 
requested an electronic method. While 
having a third party PHR certainly 
would be one method, assuming the 
provider could populate the PHR with 
all the information required to meet this 
objective. The provider should provide 
the same level of assistance to the 
patient that would be provided as if 
they maintained their own patient 
portal. 
Comments: Comments were received 
requesting the format and media for the 
provision of the health information. 
Response: As this is for use by the 
patient, the form and format should be 
human readable and comply with the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule, as specified at 45 
CFR 164.524(c). In addition, efforts 
should be made to make it easily 
understandable to the patient. The 
media could be any electronic form 
such as patient portal, PHR, CD, USB 
fob, etc. As stated in the previous 
response, EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs are expected to make reasonable

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
accommodations for patient preference 
as outlined in 45 CFR 164.522(b). 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(12)(i) and for eligible 
hospitals at § 495.6(f)(11)(i) of our 
regulations to ‘‘More than 50 percent of 
all patients of the EP or the inpatient or 
emergency departments of the eligible 
hospital or CAH (POS 21 or 23) who 
request an electronic copy of their 
health information are provided it 
within 3 business days.’’ 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(f) for EPs and 45 CFR 
170.306(d) for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. The ability to calculate the 
measure is included in certified EHR 
technology. 
As the provision of the electronic 
copy is limited to the information 
contained within certified EHR 
technology, this measure is by 
definition limited to patients whose 
records are maintained using certified 
EHR technology as described previously 
in this section under our discussion of 
the burden created by the measures 
associated with the Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: The number of 
patients of the EP or eligible hospital’s 
or CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
departments (POS 21 or 23) who request 
an electronic copy of their electronic 
health information four business days 
prior to the end of the EHR reporting 
period. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who receive an 
electronic copy of their electronic health 
information within three business days. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. As addressed in 
other objectives and in comment 
response, if the EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH has no requests from patients or 
their agents for an electronic copy of 
patient health information during the 
EHR reporting period they would be 
excluded from this requirement as 
described previously in this section 
under our discussion of whether certain 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH can meet 
all Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
given established scopes of practices. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Provide patients with an electronic copy 
of their discharge instructions and 
procedures at time of discharge, upon 
request. 
The purpose of this objective is to 
provide the option to patients to receive 
their discharge instructions 
electronically. Discharge instructions 
would not necessarily be included in a 
copy of health information and it is 
unlikely that a patient would request a 
copy of their health information at every 
discharge. This objective is unique to 
eligible hospitals and CAHs. 
Comment: We received several 
comments suggesting that we eliminate 
or clarify the term ‘‘procedures.’’ 
Response: As we believe the terms 
‘‘instructions’’ and ‘‘procedures’’ are 
interchangeable as used in this 
objective, we are removing the term 
‘‘procedures’’ from the objective. We left 
this term in the provision of electronic 
copy of health information as the term 
‘‘instructions’’ is not in that objective. 
We clarify that the term ‘‘instructions’’ 
means any directions that the patient 
must follow after discharge to attend to 
any residual conditions that need to be 
addressed personally by the patient, 
home care attendants, and other 
clinicians on an outpatient basis. 
Comment: Commenters pointed out 
that the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits 
licensed healthcare professionals to 
withhold certain information if its 
disclosure would cause substantial 
harm to the patient or another 
individual. 
Response: We reiterate that it is not 
our intent for the meaningful use 
objectives to conflict or override the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule through 
meaningful use requirements. Therefore 
an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH may 
withhold information from the 
electronic copy to the extent they are 
permitted or required to do so in 
accordance with the regulations at 45 
CFR 164.524. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended that hospitals should be 
required to either provide every patient 
an electronic copy of their discharge 
instructions or at least inform them of 
the option to receive it electronically. 
Response: We believe it would be too 
burdensome to provide every patient an 
electronic copy of his or her discharge 
instructions. Furthermore, we anticipate 
that many, if not most, patients will 
prefer a paper copy during the years of 
Stage 1. While we certainly encourage 
eligible hospitals to inform their 
patients of the option to receive their 
discharge instructions electronically, we 
do not see requiring this as within the 
scope of meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology for Stage 1. 
Comment: Comments were received 
requesting a clarification of the data that 
should be included in the discharge 
instructions. 
Response: This objective simply refers 
to the option of the electronic provision 
of instructions that would be provided 
to the patient. We believe eligible 
hospitals are the appropriate entity to 
determine the information that should 
be included in the discharge 
instructions. 
Comment: Comments were received 
requesting the format and media for the 
discharge instructions. 
Response: As this is for use by the 
patient, the form and format should be 
human readable and comply with the 
HIPAA Privacy Rule, as specified at 45 
CFR 164.524(c). In addition, efforts 
should be made to make it easily 
understandable to the patient. The 
media could be any electronic form 
such as patient portal, PHR, CD, USB 
fob, etc. EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs are expected to make reasonable 
accommodations for patient preference 
as outlined in 45 CFR 164.522(b). 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the objective at 495.6(f)(12)(i) of our 
regulations as proposed. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to involving patients 
and their families in their provision of 
care and was recommended by the HIT 
Policy Committee for inclusion in the 
core set. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Measure: At 
least 80 percent of all patients who are 
discharged from an eligible hospital and 
who request an electronic copy of their 
discharge instructions and procedures 
are provided it. 
Comment: Some commenters believed 
the 80 percent threshold was too high or 
introduced examples of extraordinary 
circumstances that would indicate that 
a lower threshold is needed to 
accommodate them. 
Response: We reduce the threshold to 
over 50 percent as this objective meets 
the criteria of relying solely on a 
capability included as part of certified 
EHR technology and is not, for purposes 
of Stage 1 criteria, reliant on the 
electronic exchange of information. 
However, as this is a relatively new 
capability that was not available to 
either providers or patients before the 
introduction of EHRs we do not believe 
it meets the same standard of practice as 
maintaining an up-to-date problem list 
and therefore adopt a threshold of 50 
percent (rather than 80 percent). 
Comment: Some commenters 
expressed concern about the reporting 
burden imposed by this requirement. 
Response: We believe that as long as 
the request by the patient is accurately 
recorded in the certified EHR

1 Please note that although the final rule 
meaningful use measures refer to patients 
discharged from an emergency department, such 
emergency room releases are not eligible hospital 
discharges for purpose of determining hospital 
payment incentives under section 1886(n) of the 
Act. Section 1886(n) payments are only with 
respect to ‘‘inpatient’’ hospital services pursuant to 
section 1886(n)(1)(A) of the Act. 
technology then the certified EHR 
technology should be able to calculate 
the measure. We believe that recording 
patient requests for certain actions that 
involve the use of certified EHR 
technology should be part of EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs standard 
practice. If the eligible hospital or CAH 
records the requests using certified EHR 
technology, certified EHR technology 
will be able to assist in calculating both 
the numerator and denominator. If the 
requests are recorded by another means 
at the choice of the provider, the 
provider would be responsible for 
determining the denominator. 
Comment: Several of the comments 
requested clarification of the timeframe 
in which the discharge instructions 
should be provided to the patient. 
Response: As discussed previously, 
this objective simply refers to the option 
of the electronic provision of 
instructions that would be provided to 
the patient at the time of discharge. 
Therefore, we believe for the 
information to be useful to the patient, 
the instructions themselves or 
instructions on how to access them 
electronically should be furnished at the 
time of discharge from the eligible 
hospital or CAH. 
Comment: Some comments expressed 
concern that providing an electronic 
copy of discharge instructions to the 
patient at the time of discharge would 
disrupt workflows and lengthen the 
discharge process resulting in reduced 
bed turnover in emergency departments. 
Response: As discussed previously, 
this objective simply refers to the option 
of the electronic provision of 
instructions that would be provided to 
the patient at the time of discharge. We 
do not believe the provision of an 
electronic copy of the discharge 
instructions, upon request, at the time of 
discharge alters current workflow or 
lengthens the discharge process. A 
patient could be provided instructions 
on how to access an Internet Web site 
where they can get the instructions or 
asked to provide an e-mail address or 
simply be handed electronic media 
instead of or in addition to a paper 
copy. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure at 
§ 495.6(f)(12)(ii) of our regulations to 
‘‘More than 50 percent of all patients 
who are discharged 1 from an eligible 
hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient or 
emergency department (POS 21 or 23) 
and who request an electronic copy of 
their discharge instructions are 
provided it.’’ 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.306(e). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As with the previous objective, the 
provision of the electronic copy of the 
discharge summary is limited to the 
information contained within certified 
EHR technology; therefore this measure 
is by definition limited to patients 
whose records are maintained using 
certified EHR technology as described 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of the burden created by the 
measures associated with the Stage 1 
meaningful use objectives. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of patients 
discharged from an eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 or 23) who request 
an electronic copy of their discharge 
instructions and procedures during the 
EHR reporting period. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who are provided an 
electronic copy of discharge 
instructions. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. 
As addressed in other objectives and 
in comment response, if the eligible 
hospital or CAH has no requests from 
patients or their agents for an electronic 
copy during the EHR reporting period 
they would be excluded from this 
requirement as described previously in 
this section under our discussion of 
whether certain EP, eligible hospital or 
CAH can meet all Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives given established scopes 
of practices. 
NPRM EP Objective: Provide patients 
with timely electronic access to their 
health information (including lab 
results, problem list, medication lists, 
and allergies) within 96 hours of the 
information being available to the EP. 
In the proposed rule, we described 
timely as within 96 hours of the 
information being available to the EP 
through either the receipt of final lab 
results or a patient interaction that 
updates the EP’s knowledge of the 
patient’s health. We said we judged 96 
hours to be a reasonable amount of time 
to ensure that certified EHR technology 
is up to date and welcomed comment on 
if a shorter or longer time is 
advantageous. We did receive comments 
on the time frame and have revised it as 
discussed below in the comment and 
response section. 
Comment: We received comments 
recommending that ‘‘access’’ be clarified 
to determine whether this is online 
access as indicated in the ONC 
certification criteria for certified EHR 
technology or just electronic access. 
Response: We believe we 
inadvertently created confusion by 
listing the examples of electronic media 
(CD or USB drive) in which this access 
could be provided. As many 
commenters inferred, it was our 
intention that this be information that 
the patient could access on demand 
such as through a patient portal or PHR. 
We did not intend for this to be another 
objective for providing an electronic 
copy of health information upon 
request. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that all objectives included in 
the health care policy priority ‘‘engage 
patients and their families’’ be 
combined, as they are redundant. 
Response: We disagree that they are 
redundant and believe each serves a 
unique purpose. We regret any 
confusion created by the inclusion of 
CD or USB drive as examples of 
electronic media caused in the intent of 
this measure. The difference between 
electronic access and an electronic copy 
is that a patient with electronic access 
can access the information on demand 
at anytime while a patient must 
affirmatively request an electronic copy 
from the EP, eligible hospital or CAH at 
a specific time and the information in 
the copy is current only as of the time 
that the copy is transferred from the 
provider to the patient. 
Comment: Some commenters asserted 
that some results and other sensitive 
information are best communicated at a 
face-to-face encounter. 
Response: We agree that there may be 
situations where a provider may decide 
that electronic access of a portal or 
Personal Health Record is not the best 
forum to communicate results. Within 
the confines of laws governing patient 
access to their medical records, we 
would defer to EP’s, eligible hospital or 
CAH’s judgment as to whether to hold 
information back in anticipation of an 
actual encounter between the provider 
and the patient. Furthermore just as in 
the provision of electronic copy, an EP 
may withhold information from being

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
accessible electronically by the patient 
in accordance with regulations at 45 
CFR 164.524. Any such withholding 
would not affect the EP’s, eligible 
hospital’s or CAH’s ability to meet this 
objective as that information would not 
be included. We do not believe there 
would be a circumstance where all 
information about an encounter would 
be withheld from the patient and 
therefore no information would be 
eligible for uploading for electronic 
access. If nothing else, the information 
that the encounter occurred can be 
provided. Please note that providers 
must comply with all applicable 
requirements under the HIPAA Privacy 
Rule, including 45 CFR 164.524. 
Comment: We received several 
comments stating that the time frame of 
96 hours is too burdensome for EPs. 
Response: While we believe that 96 
hours is sufficient, most EPs do not 
operate 24/7. Therefore, we will limit 
the timeframe to business days, in effect 
changing the timeframe from 96 hours 
in the proposed rule to four business 
days. Business days are defined as 
Monday through Friday excluding 
federal or state holidays on which the 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH or their 
respective administrative staffs are 
unavailable. 
Comment: Commenters pointed out 
that allergies is inconsistent with other 
objectives of Stage 1 and with the 
capabilities mandated by certification 
under the ONC final rule. 
Response: As we have stated on 
several other objectives, we encourage 
all EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to 
work with their EHR technology 
designers to make capabilities as 
relevant to their individual practices of 
care as possible. However, we maintain 
that at a minimum the capabilities that 
are part of certification should be 
included in certified EHR technology so 
we do modify this objective to 
medication allergies to align it with 
other objectives and certification. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the objective for EPs at § 495.6(d)(6)(i) of 
our regulations to ‘‘Provide patients with 
timely electronic access to their health 
information (including lab results, 
problem list, medication lists, 
medication allergies) within four 
business days of the information being 
available to the EP’’. 
NPRM EP Measure: At least 10 
percent of all unique patients seen by 
the EP are provided timely electronic 
access to their health information. 
In the proposed rule, we said that we 
recognize that many patients may not 
have internet access, may not be able or 
interested to use a patient portal. Health 
systems that have actively promoted 
such technologies have been able to 
achieve active use by over 30 percent of 
their patients, but this may not be 
realistic for many practices in the short 
term. We received comments on this 
justification for the threshold and 
requests for clarification, which are 
addressed in the comment and response 
section below. 
Comment: Some commenters 
expressed concern about the calculation 
of the percentage and expressed the 
preference to use an absolute count 
instead of a percentage. 
Response: We acknowledge there are 
unique concerns about calculating this 
percentage as it involves determining 
the timeliness of the information. 
Certified EHR technology would be able 
to ascertain the time from when the 
information was entered into its system 
to when the information was available 
for electronic access. As certified EHR 
technology can provide the access, any 
perceivable delay or requirement for 
affirmative action would be built in by 
the user to allow for review of the 
information before posting. Certified 
EHR technology could not be 
distinguish the difference in time when 
the information was available to the 
provider and when it was entered into 
certified EHR technology. However, we 
see no reasonable way to track this time 
frame that does not impose a heavy 
burden on the EP. Therefore, for the 
measure, we define the four business 
days time frame as the time frame when 
the information is updated in the 
certified EHR technology to when it is 
available electronically to the patient, 
unless the provider indicates that the 
information should be withheld. It is 
acceptable for a provider to set an 
automated withhold on certain 
information at their discretion. As we 
have discussed previously in this 
section, we do not believe absolute 
counts are an adequate substitute for 
percentage calculations. 
Comment: We received comments 
requesting clarification on what data 
must be made available. 
Response: Certified EHR technology 
must be able to make certain data 
available according to the ONC final 
rule. At a minimum, the data specified 
in the ONC final rule at 45 CFR 
170.304(g) must be available subject to 
the ability of the provider to withhold 
it discussed previously. 
Comment: Commenters suggested that 
some EPs might not have 10 percent of 
their patient population who desire or 
could utilize such access. 
Response: We agree that this is a 
possibility. We stated in the proposed 
rule that ‘‘we recognize that many 
patients may not have internet access, 
may not be able or interested in the use 
of a patient portal.’’ Health systems that 
have actively promoted such 
technologies have been able to achieve 
active use by over 30 percent of their 
patients. However, this 30 percent 
threshold may not be realistic for many 
practices in the short term and therefore 
serves justification for the 10 percent 
threshold. However, the objective and 
measure focus on the availability of the 
access and the timeliness of the data in 
it, not its utilization. Therefore, we 
focus on the fact that more than 10 
percent of unique patients seen during 
the EHR reporting period could access 
it and that the information is timely. 
The EP is not responsible for ensuring 
that 10 percent request access or have 
the means to access. However, we 
encourage EPs to make the availability 
of electronic access known to their 
patients. 
Comment: A commenter inquired 
about the provider’s liability versus the 
EHR technology vendor for a security 
breach of the system. 
Response: Depending on the facts 
surround the security breach, the 
provider may be liable for a violation 
under the HIPAA Privacy and Security 
Rules, as well as under any other 
applicable federal or state laws. 
Additionally, there may be 
circumstances where the EHR 
technology vendor acted as a business 
associate and may potentially have 
liability under the HIPAA Privacy and 
Security Rules. The issue of business 
associate liability under the HIPAA 
Privacy and Security Rules will be 
addressed in upcoming rulemaking. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(6)(ii) of our regulations to ‘‘At 
least 10 percent of all unique patients 
seen by the EP are provided timely 
(available to the patient within four 
business days of being updated in the 
certified EHR technology) electronic 
access to their health information 
subject to the EP’s discretion to 
withhold certain information’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(g). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology.

reporting period. A unique patient is 
discussed under the objective of CPOE. 
• Numerator: The number of patients 
in the denominator who have timely 
(available to the patient within four 
business days of being updated in the 
certified EHR technology) electronic 
access to their health information 
online. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be at least 10 percent in order for 
an EP to meet this measure. 
As addressed in other objectives and 
in comment response, if an EP neither 
orders nor creates any of the 
information listed in the ONC final rule 
45 CFR 170.304(g) and therefore 
included in the minimum data for this 
objective during the EHR reporting 
period they would be excluded from 
this requirement as described 
previously in this section under our 
discussion of whether certain EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH can meet all 
Stage 1 meaningful use objectives given 
established scopes of practices. 
NPRM EP Objective: Provide clinical 
summaries for patients for each office 
visit. 
In the proposed rule, we discussed 
why we were basing the objective on 
office visits rather than encounters. We 
said that we did want encounter to be 
construed to mean every time a provider 
interacts with the patient. We received 
comments requesting that we further 
define office visit and address those in 
the comment and response section 
below. In discussing the measure in the 
proposed rule, we also said that the 
clinical summary can be provided 
through a PHR, patient portal on the 
web site, secure email, electronic media 
such as CD or USB fob, or printed copy. 
The after-visit clinical summary 
contains an updated medication list, 
laboratory and other diagnostic test 
orders, procedures and other 
instructions based on clinical 
discussions that took place during the 
office visit. 
Comment: We received requests for 
clarification as to what constitutes an 
‘‘office visit’’. 
Response: An office visit is defined as 
any billable visit that includes: (1) 
Concurrent care or transfer of care visits, 
(2) Consultant visits and (3) Prolonged 
Physician Service without Direct (Face- 
To-Face) Patient Contact (tele-health). A 
consultant visit occurs when a provider 
is asked to render an expert opinion/ 
service for a specific condition or 
problem by a referring provider. 
Comment: Some commenters believed 
the requirement for the provision of a 
clinical summary at an office visit 
should be linked to the type or purpose 
of the office visit. Samples of the 
suggested visits are— 
—Level 4 or level 5 evaluation and 
management services; 
—Visits conducted at the conclusion of 
an episode of care; 
—Visits conducted at each transition of 
care; 
—Visits relevant to specific conditions 
such as asthma; and 
—Provider to patient face-to-face visits. 
Response: We believe that a clinical 
summary should be provided at all 
office visits included in the definition of 
office visit as defined in this final rule. 
We believe all of the office visits 
described in our definition result in the 
EP rendering a clinical judgment that 
should be communicated to the patient. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
CMS define ‘‘clinical summary’’ and 
offered several specific data elements 
that should be included in the 
definition such as patient name, 
provider name, date of visit, location of 
visit, reason for visit, updated 
medication list, laboratory orders, 
diagnostic orders, patient instructions 
based on discussions with the provider 
and a nutrition care management plan. 
Response: After reviewing the 
comments we define clinical summary 
as an after-visit summary that provides 
a patient with relevant and actionable 
information and instructions containing, 
but not limited to, the patient name, 
provider’s office contact information, 
date and location of visit, an updated 
medication list and summary of current 
medications, updated vitals, reason(s) 
for visit, procedures and other 
instructions based on clinical 
discussions that took place during the 
office visit, any updates to a problem 
list, immunizations or medications 
administered during visit, summary of 
topics covered/considered during visit, 
time and location of next appointment/ 
testing if scheduled, or a recommended 
appointment time if not scheduled, list 
of other appointments and testing 
patient needs to schedule with contact 
information, recommended patient 
decision aids, laboratory and other 
diagnostic test orders, test/laboratory 
results (if received before 24 hours after 
visit), and symptoms. 
Comment: Commenters pointed out 
that the HIPAA Privacy Rule permits 
licensed healthcare professionals to 
withhold certain information if its 
disclosure would cause substantial 
harm to the patient or another 
individual. 
Response: As the EP is proactively 
providing this information to the 
patient, 45 CFR 164.524 of the HIPAA 
Privacy rule does not apply to this 
situation. However, we still believe that 
an EP should be able to withhold 
information if its disclosure would 
cause substantial harm to the patient or 
another individual. Therefore, if in their 
judgment substantial harm may arise 
from the disclosure of particular 
information, an EP may choose to 
withhold that particular information 
from the clinical summary 
Comment: Most commenters noted 
that other than ‘‘at the time of the visit’’, 
there was no specific time period given 
in which to comply with this objective. 
If CMS intended ‘‘at the time of the visit’’ 
to mean before the patient leaves the 
building or upon the patient’s request, 
neither are possible due to workflow 
and review processes. Most commenters 
assumed we would associate the 48 
hours related to the ‘copy’ requirement 
or the 96 hours related to the ‘access’ 
requirement to address this comment 
and stated that both were too short a 
period for a clinical visit summary. 
Others recommended the 30-day 
timeframe for the provision information 
set forth under the HIPAA Privacy Rule. 
Response: We agree that our proposed 
objective lacked specificity about the 
time to comply. To provide such 
specificity, we adopt the timeframe of 
three business days from our objective 
of providing electronic health 
information to the patient. That is three 
business days following the day of the 
visit excluding holidays as described in 
the providing electronic health 
information to the patient objective. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested changes to the media through 
which this information could be 
provided. Differing commenters 
recommended eliminating the paper 
option, while others recommended only 
the paper option. 
Response: We believe that more 
options give the EP needed flexibility. 
The EP could choose any of the listed 
means from the proposed rule of PHR, 
patient portal on a Web site, secure 
email, electronic media such as CD or 
USB fob, or printed copy. If the EP 
chooses an electronic media, they 
would be required to provide the patient 
a paper copy upon request. Both forms 
can be and should be produced by 
certified EHR technology. 
Comment: Several commenters 
indicated that a provider should be 
allowed to charge a fee for providing the 
copy. 
Response: As this is a proactive 
requirement on the part of the EP and 
not a response to a request from the 
patient, we do not believe it is 
appropriate to charge the patient a fee 
for this copy. We note that we give the 
EP considerable flexibility in the

manner in which the copy is provided 
including the provision of a paper copy. 
The only accommodation an EP is 
required to make is the provision of a 
paper copy that can be automatically 
generated certified EHR technology. We 
therefore believe that costs of this will 
be negligible. 
Comment: A number of commenters 
expressed concern regarding whether 
the current available technology could 
produce a summary of the required 
information in a standardized format, 
the use of clinical nomenclature rather 
than lay terms and the fact that some 
providers use multiple modules to 
document the care of the patient. 
Response: We believe it is appropriate 
to leave the design of EHR technology 
systems and their outputs to the system 
developers and the EHR technology 
users. However, we note that the 
capability to meet this objective is 
included in the ONC final rule at 45 
CFR 170.304(h) as a criteria for certified 
EHR technology and we are confident 
that vendors will be able to produce 
certified EHR technologies. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the objective for EPs at § 495.6(d)(13)(i) 
of our regulations as proposed. 
We include this objective in the core 
set as it is integral to involving patients 
and their families in their provision of 
care and was recommended by the HIT 
Policy Committee for inclusion in the 
core set. 
NPRM EP Measure: Clinical 
summaries provided to patients for at 
least 80 percent of all office visits. 
Comment: Some commenters believed 
the threshold was too high or should be 
replaced with a numerical count or 
attestation. 
Response: We reduce the threshold to 
over 50 percent as this objective meets 
the criteria of relying solely on a 
capability included as part of certified 
EHR technology and is not, for purposes 
of Stage 1 criteria, reliant on the 
electronic exchange of information. 
Also, as this is a relatively new 
capability that was not available to 
either providers or patients before the 
introduction of EHRs, we do not believe 
it meets the same standard of practice as 
maintaining an up-to-date problem list 
and therefore adopt a threshold of 50 
percent (rather than 80 percent). 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(13)(ii) of our regulation to 
‘‘Clinical summaries provided to 
patients for more than 50 percent of all 
office visits within 3 business days’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(h). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As with the previous objective, the 
provision of the clinical summary is 
limited to the information contained 
within certified EHR technology; 
therefore this measure is by definition 
limited to patients whose records are 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology as described previously in 
this section under our discussion of the 
burden created by the measures 
associated with the Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients seen by the EP for an office 
during the EHR reporting period. A 
unique patient is discussed under the 
objective of using CPOE. 
• Numerator: Number of patients in 
the denominator who are provided a 
clinical summary of their visit within 
three business days. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. 
As addressed in other objectives, EPs 
who have no office visits during the 
EHR reporting period would be 
excluded from this requirement as 
described previously in this section 
under our discussion of whether certain 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH can meet 
all Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
given established scopes of practices. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
‘‘Provide access to patient-specific 
education resources upon request.’’ 
In the proposed rule, we discussed 
this objective, but did not propose it. 
We stated that there was a paucity of 
knowledge resources that are integrated 
with EHR, and that also are widely 
available. We also noted that the ability 
to provide education resources in 
multiple languages might be limited. We 
stated our intent to further explore the 
objective in subsequent stages of 
meaningful use. 
Comment: We received many 
comments, including comments from 
both the HIT Policy Committee and 
MedPAC, to include this measure in the 
final rule. These commenters disagreed 
with our assertion in the proposed rule 
that ‘‘there is currently a paucity of 
knowledge resources that are integrated 
within EHRs, that are widely available, 
and that meet these criteria, particularly 
in multiple languages.’’ Specific 
examples of the availability of 
knowledge resources integrated with 
current EHRs were provided. The HIT 
Policy Committee amended their 
recommendation in their comments on 
the proposed rule to: 
—EPs and hospitals should report on 
the percentage of patients for whom 
they use the EHR to suggest patient- 
specific education resources. 
Other recommended language for the 
objective includes: 
—Provide patients educational 
information that is specific to their 
health needs as identified by 
information contained in their EHR 
technology such as diagnoses and 
demographic data, and 
—The original HIT Policy Committee 
objective of ‘‘Provide access to patient- 
specific education resources upon 
request.’’ 
Response: We are convinced by 
commenters that the availability of 
education resources linked to EHRs is 
more widely available than we had 
indicated in the proposed rule. 
Therefore, for the final rule we will 
include this objective for the Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. We note that the new 
recommendation of the HIT Policy 
Committee is a hybrid of a measure and 
an objective, whereas in developing the 
meaningful use criteria we consistently 
identify both an objective and 
associated measure. However, we agree 
with the HIT Policy Committee and 
others that the objective and associated 
measure should make clear that the EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH should utilize 
certified EHR technology in a manner 
where the technology suggests patient- 
specific educational resources based on 
the information stored in the certified 
EHR technology. Therefore, we are 
including a revised version of this 
objective in the final rule for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use. 
We also believe it is necessary to state 
what level of EP, eligible hospital and 
CAH discretion is available when 
deciding whether to provide education 
resources identified by certified EHR 
technology to the patient. Therefore, we 
include the phrase ‘‘if appropriate’’, 
which allows the EP or the authorized 
provider in the eligible hospital or CAH 
final decision on whether the education 
resource is useful and relevant to a 
specific patient. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are including 
this meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(6)(i) and eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(5)(i) of our 
regulations as ‘‘Use certified EHR 
technology to identify patient-specific 
education resources and provide those 
resources to the patient if appropriate’’.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Not applicable. 
Comment: CMS received a comment 
requesting an 80 percent threshold of 
appropriate patients and/or caregivers 
receiving patient-specific educational 
materials. In addition, the HIT Policy 
Committee’s revised objective suggests a 
patient based percentage. 
Response: As with the addition of the 
recording of advance directives, we are 
able to relate this measure to one that 
is based on patients and can be 
accomplished solely using certified EHR 
technology. As this objective requires 
more than just the recording of 
information in certified EHR 
technology, we adopt a lower threshold 
of 10 percent. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are including 
this meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(6)(ii) and eligible hospitals at 
§ 495.6(g)(5)(ii) of our regulations as 
‘‘More than 10 percent of all unique 
patients seen by the EP or admitted to 
the eligible hospital’s or CAH’s 
inpatient or emergency department 
(POS 21 or 23) are provided patient- 
specific education resources’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(m). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
To calculate the percentage, CMS and 
ONC have worked together to define the 
following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of unique 
patients seen by the EP or admitted to 
the eligible hospital’s or CAH’s 
inpatient or emergency department 
(POS 21 or 23) during the EHR reporting 
period. A unique patient is discussed 
under the CPOE objective. 
• Numerator: Number of patients in 
the denominator who are provided 
patient education specific resources. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 10 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. 
We do not believe that any EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH will not have more 
than 10 percent of their patients eligible 
to receive patient specific education 
resources and therefore do not believe 
an exclusion is necessary for this 
objective. 
The third health outcomes policy 
priority identified by the HIT Policy 
Committee is to improve care 
coordination. The HIT Policy 
Committee recommended the following 
care goals to address this priority: 
• Exchange meaningful clinical 
information among professional health 
care team. 
NPRM EP Objective: Capability to 
exchange key clinical information (for 
example, problem list, medication list, 
allergies, and diagnostic test results), 
among providers of care and patient 
authorized entities electronically. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Capability to exchange key clinical 
information (for example, discharge 
summary, procedures, problem list, 
medication list, allergies, diagnostic test 
results), among providers of care and 
patient authorized entities 
electronically. 
In the proposed rule, we defined the 
term ‘‘diagnostic test results ’’ as all data 
needed to diagnose and treat disease, 
such as blood tests, microbiology, 
urinalysis, pathology tests, radiology, 
cardiac imaging, nuclear medicine tests, 
and pulmonary function tests. We 
maintain this description for the final 
rule. We said that when the information 
was available in a structured format we 
expected that it be transferred in a 
structured format. However, if it was 
unavailable in a structured format, that 
the transmission of unstructured data 
was permissible. We provide additional 
information on structured data in the 
comment and response section, but 
maintain for the final rule the concept 
that the exchange can be of structured 
or unstructured data. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the term ‘‘key clinical 
information.’’ 
Response: By ‘‘clinical information’’, 
we mean all data needed to diagnose 
and treat disease, such as blood tests, 
microbiology, urinalysis, pathology 
tests, radiology, cardiac imaging, 
nuclear medicine tests, and pulmonary 
function tests. We leave it to the 
provider’s clinical judgment as to 
identifying what clinical information is 
considered key clinical information for 
purposes of exchanging clinical 
information about a patient at a 
particular time with other providers of 
care. The examples we provided in the 
proposed rule and the final rule below 
are not intended to be exhaustive. ONC 
in their final rule provides a minimum 
set of information that certified EHR 
technology must be able to exchange in 
order to be certified. A provider’s 
determination of key clinical 
information could include some or all of 
this information as well as information 
not included in the ONC final rule at 45 
CFR 170.304(i) for EPs and 45 CFR 
170.306(f) for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the term ‘‘patient 
authorized entities.’’ 
Response: By ‘‘patient authorized 
entities’’, we mean any individual or 
organization to which the patient has 
granted access to their clinical 
information. Examples would include 
an insurance company that covers the 
patient, an entity facilitating health 
information exchange among providers 
or a personal health record vendor 
identified by the patient. A patient 
would have to affirmatively grant access 
to these entities. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the term ‘‘exchange.’’ 
Response: We expect that this 
information, when exchanged 
electronically, would be exchanged in 
structured electronic format when 
available (for example, drug and clinical 
lab data). However, where the 
information is available only in 
unstructured electronic formats (for 
example, free text and scanned images), 
we would allow the exchange of 
unstructured information. We believe 
that the electronic exchange of 
information is most efficient when it is 
exchanged from a provider’s certified 
EHR technology to another certified 
EHR technology either directly or 
through an entity facilitating health 
information exchange using structured 
data that can be automatically identified 
by the receiving system and integrated 
into the receiver’s records. However, we 
know that much information cannot 
currently be, and may never be, 
transmitted in the way we just 
described. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of the term ‘‘structured 
data.’’ 
Response: This distinction between 
structured data and unstructured data 
applies to all types of information. We 
have previously defined structured data 
in this section. To ensure that certified 
EHR technology has a certain level of 
functionality, ONC at 45 CFR 170.304(i) 
for EPs and 45 CFR 170.306(f) for 
eligible hospitals and CAHs specified 
certain types of information that a 
certified EHR technology must be able 
to exchange to become certified. ONC 
also provided standards to support this 
exchange. These standards do not 
preclude a vendor of EHR technology 
from enabling its product to exchange 
additional types of information nor limit 
the provider’s discretion (either in 
exchanging more or less) in deciding 
what information is key and should be 
exchanged about a given patient at a 
given time. 
Comment: Commenters expressed 
concern that the exchange of key

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
clinical information via certified EHR 
systems requires a unique or national 
patient identifier to ensure accurate 
exchange. 
Response: While such an identifier 
could facilitate an exchange, it need 
only be unique to the parties involved 
in the exchange and need not be 
national in scope, nor is a specific 
unique identifier necessary for 
successful exchanges. Many current 
health information exchanges have had 
success identifying patients by a 
combination of several elements of 
information without a separate 
independent identifier. 
Comment: Commenters pointed out 
that the general term ‘‘allergies’’ is 
inconsistent with other objectives of 
Stage 1 and with the capabilities 
mandated by certification under the 
ONC final rule, which uses the term 
‘‘medication allergies’’. 
Response: As we have stated on 
several other objectives, we encourage 
all EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to 
work with their certified EHR 
technology designers to make 
capabilities most relevant to their 
individual practices of care. However, 
we have maintained that at a minimum 
the capabilities that are part of 
certification should be included so we 
modify the example to change allergies 
to medication allergies to align it with 
other objectives and certification. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(14)(i) of our regulations to 
‘‘Capability to exchange key clinical 
information (for example, problem list, 
medication list, medication allergies, 
and diagnostic test results), among 
providers of care and patient authorized 
entities electronically’’ and for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs at § 495.6(f)(13)(i) to 
‘‘Capability to exchange key clinical 
information (for example, discharge 
summary, procedures, problem list, 
medication list, medication allergies, 
diagnostic test results), among providers 
of care and patient authorized entities 
electronically’’. 
In response to our revised 
requirements for meeting meaningful 
use, we included this objective in the 
core set. Section 1848 (o)(2)(A)(ii) of the 
Act specifically includes electronic 
exchange of health information in 
meaningful use for eligible 
professionals. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Performed at least one test of certified 
EHR technology’s capacity to 
electronically exchange key clinical 
information. 
In the proposed rule, we identified 
this objective as reliant on the electronic 
exchange of information. We said that 
we are aware that in most areas of the 
country, the infrastructure necessary to 
support such exchange is still being 
developed. Therefore, for the Stage 1 
criteria of meaningful use we proposed 
that EPs and eligible hospitals test their 
ability to send such information at least 
once prior to the end of the EHR 
reporting period. We proposed that the 
testing could occur prior to the 
beginning of the EHR reporting period. 
We also said that if multiple EPs are 
using the same certified EHR technology 
in a shared physical setting, the testing 
would only have to occur once for a 
given certified EHR technology, as we 
do not see any value to running the 
same test multiple times just because 
multiple EPs use the same certified EHR 
technology. Finally, we attempted to 
define an ‘‘exchange’’ as the clinical 
information must be sent between 
different clinical entities with distinct 
certified EHR technology and not 
between organizations that share a 
certified EHR. We received many 
comments requesting further 
clarification on these concepts and we 
attempt to provide additional 
information in the comment and 
response section below. 
Comment: Commenters expressed 
concern that the receiving entities are 
not required to have the same 
capabilities as meaningful users of 
certified EHR technology. 
Response: The HITECH Act does not 
provide us the authority to require any 
entity (medical provider or otherwise) to 
conform to certain standards and 
criteria unless they seek to become a 
meaningful EHR user. The Act also 
limits the entities that are eligible to 
become meaningful EHR users. In 
developing the associated measure for 
this objective, we have ensured that 
eligible providers will be able to meet 
this objective as long as there is one 
other entity with which they can test 
their capability. As electronic exchange 
is not constrained by distance, we are 
confident that every provider seeking to 
test their system will be able to find 
another entity with which to conduct 
such test. 
Comment: Commenters asked 
whether the test needs to be ‘‘live’’ or if 
it could be a ‘‘simulation.’’ 
Response: As specified in the 
proposed rule, this test must involve the 
actual submission of information to 
another provider of care with distinct 
certified EHR technology or other 
system capable of receiving the 
information. 
Comment: Commenters asked 
whether the use of ‘‘test’’ or ‘‘dummy’’ 
data is permissible. 
Response: While the use of test 
patient information may increase the 
risk that the system will not be testing 
to its full capability, given the privacy 
and security concerns surrounding the 
transmission of actual patient 
information we do not require it for the 
purposes of a test. Therefore, the use of 
test information about a fictional patient 
that would be identical in form to what 
would be sent about an actual patient 
would satisfy this objective. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
deferring the measure to a later stage 
due to the lack of a mature HIE 
infrastructure and/or to emulate the 
Health Information and Management 
System Society (HIMSS) EMR Adoption 
Model. 
Response: We agree that many areas 
of the country currently lack the 
infrastructure to support the electronic 
exchange of information. As the goal of 
this meaningful use objective is to 
ensure that certified EHR technology 
has the capability to electronically 
exchange key clinical information, we 
only require a single test. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use measure at 
§ 495.6(d)(14)(ii) and § 495.6(f)(13)(ii) of 
our regulations as proposed. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(i) for EPs and 45 CFR 
170.306(f) for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. The ability to calculate the 
measure is included in certified EHR 
technology. EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs should attempt to identify one 
other entity with whom to conduct a 
test of the submission of electronic data. 
This test must include the transfer of 
either actual or ‘‘dummy’’ data to the 
chosen other entity. The testing could 
occur prior to the beginning of the EHR 
reporting period, but must occur prior to 
the end of the EHR reporting period and 
every payment year would require its 
own, unique test as infrastructure for 
health information exchange is expected 
to mature over time. Therefore, if an 
eligible hospital or CAH were to become 
a meaningful EHR user in 2011 for their 
first payment year, they would have to 
conduct another, unique test to become 
a meaningful EHR user in 2012 for their 
second payment year. If multiple EPs 
are using the same certified EHR 
technology in a shared physical setting, 
the testing would only have to occur 
once for a given certified EHR 
technology, as we do not see any value 
to running the same test multiple times 
just because multiple EPs use the same

certified EHR technology. To be 
considered an ‘‘exchange’’ for this 
objective and measure the clinical 
information must be sent between 
different legal entities with distinct 
certified EHR technology or other 
system that can accept the information 
and not between organizations that 
share certified EHR technology. CMS 
will accept a yes/no attestation to verify 
all of the above for EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs. 
As the measure already accounts for 
the possibility of a failed test and we are 
confident that everyone will be identify 
an entity with which to conduct a test, 
we do not believe an exception is 
required for EPs, eligible hospitals or 
CAHs. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Perform medication reconciliation at 
relevant encounters and each transition 
of care. 
In the proposed rule, we described 
‘‘medication reconciliation’’ as the 
process of identifying the most accurate 
list of all medications that the patient is 
taking, including name, dosage, 
frequency and route, by comparing the 
medical record to an external list of 
medications obtained from a patient, 
hospital or other provider. We maintain 
this description for the final rule. We 
also described ‘‘relevant encounter’’ and 
‘‘transition of care’’; however, as we 
received comments requested additional 
clarification of these terms we address 
them in the comment and response 
section below. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that this objective be deferred 
until it can be conducted using the 
exchange of electronic information 
between certified EHR technology. 
Other commenters believed that the 
process is not one for avoiding 
medication errors, but a human 
workflow process supported by the 
EHR, and not an automated EHR 
process. 
Response: We certainly look forward 
to a time when most medication 
reconciliation occurs as an automated 
process within the EHR reconciling 
information that has been exchanged. 
However, it is unlikely that an 
automated process within the EHR will 
fully supplant the medication 
reconciliation conducted between the 
provider and the patient. In order for 
this automated reconciliation process to 
occur and be useful, the relevant 
structured data exchanged needs to be 
as accurate as possible. Requiring 
medication reconciliation as part of 
meaningful use in Stage 1 lays the 
groundwork for future reliable 
electronic exchange. We therefore do 
not believe this objective should be 
deferred to a later stage. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
additional clarity of the term ‘‘relevant 
encounter.’’ Only a few suggestions on 
such clarity were provided by 
commenters. Two examples of 
commenters’ recommendations are 
‘‘when a prescription is generated’’ and 
‘‘a significant change in the patient’s 
condition that resulted in change in 
medication regimen which could 
include significant change in dosing of 
more than 1 medication, identification 
of a new medical condition, decline in 
functional status or change in advanced 
directive.’’ 
Response: We finalize our proposal by 
defining ‘‘relevant encounter’’ as an 
encounter during which the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH performs a medication 
reconciliation due to new medication or 
long gaps in time between patient 
encounters or for other reasons 
determined appropriate by the EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH. Essentially an 
encounter is relevant if the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH judges it to be so. This 
flexibility has implications for the 
measure that were not fully considered 
in the proposed rule. We will discuss 
those below in connection with our 
discussion of the associated measure. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
additional clarity of the term ‘‘transition 
of care.’’ A few suggestions were 
provided by commenters including 
expanding the description to include all 
transfers to different settings within a 
hospital or revising the definition to 
‘‘the movement of a patient from one 
setting of care (hospital, ambulatory 
primary care practice, ambulatory 
specialty care practice, long-term care, 
home health, rehabilitation facility) to 
another’’. 
Response: In the proposed rule we 
clarified ‘‘transition of care’’ as the 
transfer of a patient from one clinical 
setting (inpatient, outpatient, physician 
office, home health, rehab, long-term 
care facility, etc.) to another or from one 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH (as defined 
by CCN) to another. We believe that 
different settings within one hospital 
using certified EHR technology would 
have access to the same information so 
reconciliation would not be necessary. 
We modify our clarification to account 
for some of the revisions provided. We 
clarify ‘‘transition of care’’ as the 
movement of a patient from one setting 
of care (hospital, ambulatory primary 
care practice, ambulatory specialty care 
practice, long-term care, home health, 
rehabilitation facility) to another. We 
also clarify that the receiving eligible 
hospital or EP would conduct the 
medication reconciliation. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification on which EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH would conduct 
the medication reconciliation. The one 
to whom the patient is transferred or the 
one who transfers the patient. 
Response: When conducting 
medication reconciliation during a 
transfer of care, we believe that it is the 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH that 
receives the patient into their care that 
should conduct the medication 
reconciliation. It is for this provider that 
the information is most crucial, as they 
will be making the future clinical 
judgments regarding the patient. 
Therefore, we revise this objective and 
its associated measure to reflect this 
clarification. 
Comment: Commenters requested a 
standard list be defined for the process 
including prescription and non 
prescription medications, herbal 
products, dietary supplements, 
prescriber, drug name, regimen and 
allergies. 
Response: We believe the information 
included in the process of medication 
reconciliation is appropriately 
determined by the provider and patient. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(7)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(6)(i) of our 
regulations to ‘‘The EP, eligible hospital 
or CAH who receives a patient from 
another setting of care or provider of 
care or believes an encounter is relevant 
should perform medication 
reconciliation’’. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Perform medication reconciliation for at 
least 80 percent of relevant encounters 
and transitions of care. 
Comment: Commenters believed it 
was an unjustifiable burden to record 
which encounters were relevant and 
which were not given our flexible 
definition of ‘‘relevant encounter’’. 
Response: We agree that the inclusion 
of relevant encounters creates a burden 
that one commenter described as ‘‘non- 
value-added work’’. We also believe that 
when the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
identifies the encounter as relevant, it is 
unlikely that the EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH would then not carry out the 
medication reconciliation. For these 
reasons, we are removing relevant 
encounters from the measure for this 
objective. 
Comment: Commenters said the 
percent measurements should be 
replaced with a numerical count or an 
attestation the objective has been met or 
the demonstration of the capability by 
performing one test of certified EHR 
technology’s capacity to present

providers with patient medication 
information that supports the 
reconciliation of medications at time of 
admission and discharge. Other 
commenters stated the proposed 80 
percent threshold was too high. 
Response: We are maintaining a 
percentage for the reasons discussed 
previously in this section. However, we 
do reduce the threshold to over 50 
percent as this objective meets the 
criteria of relying solely on a capability 
included as part of certified EHR 
technology and while not absolutely 
reliant on electronic exchange of 
information, it does involve the 
exchange of information between 
providers and therefore we adopt a 
threshold of 50 percent (rather than 8 
percent). 
Comment: Commenters requested we 
align this objective with The Joint 
Commission National Patient Safety 
Goal on medication reconciliation (Goal 
8) in order to decrease confusion, 
prevent the slowing of adoption of best 
practices and match current hospital 
reconciliation processes. 
Response: CMS understands the 
commenters’ concerns regarding 
possible confusion if the meaningful use 
medication reconciliation requirement 
differs from The Joint Commission’s 
requirement for those facilities 
accredited by that organization. 
However, currently there is no finalized 
Joint Commission standard as the 
Commission is currently in the process 
of re-evaluating their National Patient 
Safety Goal 8 (Accurately and 
completely reconcile medications across 
the continuum of care) given the 
difficulties that many organizations are 
having in meeting the complex 
requirements. In the absence of a 
definitive Joint Commission standard to 
take into consideration, this is not 
possible. 
Comment: Some commenters 
expressed the desire to expand the 
scope of the measure to include the 
clinical decision making and patient 
counseling and education by a 
pharmacist. 
Response: We believe that is both 
beyond the scope of meaningful use as 
pharmacists are not eligible 
professionals for the EHR incentive 
programs and that the provision of 
patient counseling is more aligned with 
the objectives of clinical quality 
measures. Information from the 
medication reconciliation could be used 
for the basis of clinical decision support 
rules, but is not in and of itself a clinical 
decision. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(7)(ii) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(6)(ii) of our 
regulations to ‘‘The EP, eligible hospital 
or CAH performs medication 
reconciliation for more than 50 percent 
of transitions of care in which the 
patient is transitioned into the care of 
the EP or admitted to the eligible 
hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient or 
emergency department (POS 21 or 23)’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(j). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. 
As discussed previously in this 
section under our discussion of the 
burden created by the measures 
associated with the Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives, we only include in the 
denominator transitions of care related 
to patients whose records are 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology. To calculate the percentage, 
CMS and ONC have worked together to 
define the following for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of transitions 
of care during the EHR reporting period 
for which the EP or eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s inpatient or emergency 
department (POS 21 to 23) was the 
receiving party of the transition. 
• Numerator: The number of 
transitions of care in the denominator 
where medication reconciliation was 
performed. 
• Threshold: The resulting percentage 
must be more than 50 percent in order 
for an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH to 
meet this measure. If an EP was not on 
the receiving end of any transition of 
care during the EHR reporting period 
they would be excluded as previously 
discussed in this section under our 
discussion of whether certain EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH can meet all 
Stage 1 meaningful use objectives given 
established scopes of practices. We do 
not believe that any eligible hospital or 
CAH would be in a situation where they 
would not need to know the precise 
medications their patients are taking. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Provide summary care record for each 
transition of care or referral. 
In the proposed rule, we pointed out 
that this objective was not explicitly 
included in the HIT Policy Committee’s 
recommended objectives, but that they 
did include a measure for the ‘‘percent 
of transitions in care for which 
summary care record is shared.’’ We said 
that we believe that in order for a 
measure to be relevant it must 
correspond to an objective in the 
definition of meaningful use. Therefore, 
we proposed to add this objective in 
order to be able to include the 
recommended measure. Furthermore, 
we add referrals because the sharing of 
the patient care summary from one 
provider to another communicates 
important information that the patient 
may not have been able to provide, and 
can significantly improve the quality 
and safety of referral care, and reduce 
unnecessary and redundant testing. We 
received support for this inclusion from 
commenters and include this objective 
in the final rule for the reasons outlined 
in the proposed rule. We did receive 
comments requesting clarifications 
around this objective and address them 
in the comment and response section 
below. 
Comment: We received several 
comments that requested clarification as 
to the purpose of this objective. 
Response: The purpose of this 
objective is to ensure a summary of care 
record is provided to the receiving 
provider when a patient is transitioning 
to a new provider or has been referred 
to another provider while still 
remaining under the care of the referring 
provider. If the provider to whom the 
referral is made or to whom the patient 
is transitioned to has access to the 
medical record maintained by the 
referring provider then the summary of 
care record would not need to be 
provided. The most common example 
cited by commenters was a referral 
during which patient remains an 
inpatient of the hospital. Finally, unlike 
with medication reconciliation, where 
the receiving party of the transfer 
conducts the action, the transferring 
party would provide the summary care 
record to the receiving party. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
additional clarity of the term ‘‘transition 
of care’’. A few suggestions were 
provided by the commenters including 
expanding the description to include all 
transfers to different settings within a 
hospital or revising the definition to 
‘‘the movement of a patient from one 
setting of care (hospital, ambulatory 
primary care practice, ambulatory, 
specialty care practice, long-term care, 
home health, rehabilitation facility) to 
another’’. 
Response: In the proposed rule we 
clarified that the term transition of care 
means a transfer of a patient from one 
clinical setting (inpatient, outpatient, 
physician office, home health, rehab, 
long-term care facility, etc.) to another 
or from one EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH (as defined by CMS Certification 
Number (CCN) to another. We believe 
that different settings within a hospital 
using certified EHR technology would 
have access to the same information so

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
providing a clinical care summary 
would not be necessary. We further 
clarify transition of care as the 
movement of a patient from one setting 
of care (hospital, ambulatory primary 
care practice, ambulatory, specialty care 
practice, long-term care, home health, 
rehabilitation facility) to another. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification on which EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH should provide 
the summary of care document; the one 
to whom the patient is transferred or 
referred or the one who transfers or 
refers the patient. 
Response: We believe that it is the EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH that transfers or 
refers the patient to another setting of 
care or provider that should provide the 
summary of care document. It is for this 
provider that has the most recent 
information on the patient that may be 
crucial to the provider to whom the 
patient is transferred or referred. 
Therefore, we revise this objective and 
its associated measure to reflect this 
clarification. 
Comment: Commenters asked for 
clarification on how the summary of 
care record should be transferred. 
Response: The goal is to get the 
summary care record into the next 
provider’s possession. While we highly 
encourage all EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs to explore ways to 
accomplish the transfer using electronic 
exchange, we realize that this capability 
is still in the development stages. 
Therefore, an EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH could send an electronic or paper 
copy of the summary care record 
directly to the next provider or could 
provide it to the patient to deliver to the 
next provider, if the patient can 
reasonably expected to do so. Certified 
EHR technology would be used to 
generate the summary of care record and 
to document that it was provided to the 
patient or receiving provider. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(8)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(7)(i) of our 
regulations to ‘‘The EP, eligible hospital 
or CAH who transitions their patient to 
another setting of care or provider of 
care or refers their patient to another 
provider of care should provide 
summary care record for each transition 
of care or referral’’. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Provide summary of care record for at 
least 80 percent of transitions of care 
and referrals. 
Comment: Commenters said that this 
should be replaced with a count and 
that the threshold was too high. 
Response: We are maintaining a 
percentage for the reasons discussed 
previously in this section. However, we 
do reduce the threshold to over 50 
percent as this objective meets the 
criteria of relying solely on a capability 
included as part of certified EHR 
technology and while not absolutely 
reliant on electronic exchange of 
information, it does involve the 
exchange of information between 
providers and therefore we adopt a 
threshold of 50 percent (rather than 80 
percent). 
Comment: There were concerns about 
the ability of certified EHR technology 
to calculate this measure. As long as an 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH records the 
order for a referral or transfer as 
structured data and a record is made 
that the summary care record was 
provided then certified EHR technology 
will be able to calculate this measure. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(8)(ii) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(7)(ii) of our 
regulations to ‘‘The EP, eligible hospital 
or CAH who transitions or refers their 
patient to another setting of care or 
provider of care provides a summary of 
care record for more than 50 percent of 
transitions of care and referrals’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
included as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.304(i) for EPs and 45 CFR 
170.306(f) for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. The ability to calculate the 
measure is included in certified EHR 
technology. 
As discussed previously in this 
section under our discussion of the 
burden created by the measures 
associated with the Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives, we only include in the 
denominator transitions of care and 
referrals related to patients whose 
records that are maintained using 
certified EHR technology. To calculate 
the percentage, CMS and ONC have 
worked together to define the following 
for this objective: 
• Denominator: Number of transitions 
of care and referrals during the EHR 
reporting period for which the EP or 
eligible hospital’s or CAH’s inpatient or 
emergency department (POS 21 to 23) 
was the transferring or referring 
provider. 
• Numerator: The number of 
transitions of care and referrals in the 
denominator where a summary of care 
record was provided. 
• Threshold: The percentage must be 
more than 50 percent in order for an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH to meet this 
measure. 
As addressed in other objectives and 
in comment response, if an EP does not 
transfer a patient to another setting or 
refer a patient to another provider 
during the EHR reporting period then 
they would have a situation of a null 
denominator as described would be 
excluded from this requirement as 
described previously in this section 
under our discussion of whether certain 
EP, eligible hospital or CAH can meet 
all Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
given established scopes of practices. 
We do not believe that any eligible 
hospital or CAH would be in a situation 
where they would never transfer a 
patient to another care setting or make 
a referral to another provider. 
The fourth health outcomes policy 
priority identified by the HIT Policy 
Committee is improving population and 
public health. The HIT Policy 
Committee identified the following care 
goal to address this priority: 
• The patient’s health care team 
communicates with public health 
agencies. 
The goal as recommended by the HIT 
Policy Committee is ‘‘communicate with 
public health agencies.’’ In the proposed 
rule, we explained that we found this 
goal to be somewhat ambiguous, as it 
does not specify who must 
communicate with public health 
agencies. We propose to specify ‘‘the 
patient’s health care team’’ as the 
individuals who would communicate 
with public health agencies. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Capability to submit electronic data to 
immunization registries and actual 
submission where required and 
accepted. 
In the proposed rule, we did not 
elaborate on this objective. 
Comment: Some commenters 
suggested out that not every EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH administers 
immunization. Therefore, as proposed, 
this objective and its associated measure 
would require an EP, eligible hospital, 
or CAH to implement and test a 
capability that they would not use. 
Response: We acknowledge that this 
objective is not relevant to all EPs, 
eligible hospitals or CAHs. Therefore, in 
this final rule, we clarify that this 
objective and its associated measure 
apply only to EPs, eligible hospitals or 
CAHs that administer one or more 
immunizations during the EHR 
reporting period. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended revising the language of 
the immunization objective to be 
consistent with the language of the 
syndromic surveillance objective by

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
replacing ‘‘where required and 
accepted’’ with ‘‘according to applicable 
law and practice.’’ 
Response: First, we make a technical 
correction. The objective listed for EPs 
on page 1858 of the proposed rule listed 
this objective as ‘‘Capability to submit 
electronic data to immunization 
registries and actual submission where 
possible and accepted.’’ The objective 
was intended to be ‘‘Capability to submit 
electronic data to immunization 
registries and actual submission where 
required and accepted’’ for EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs. It is written as 
such in every other instance in the 
proposed rule including the regulation 
text. Second, in response to the 
comment that ‘‘where required and 
accepted’’ be replaced with ‘‘according 
to applicable law and practice’’, we see 
little distinction between the two in 
terms of requirement as applicable law 
and practice would be the things 
imposing a requirement. Therefore, we 
adopt the proposed language, but 
modify the language slightly to ‘‘in 
accordance with applicable law and 
practice’’. We do note however, that 
applicable law and practice do not 
guarantee every receiving entity will be 
able to accept it electronically. Our 
measure for meeting this objective is 
one test of electronic data submission 
and if the test is successful follow up 
submission to that one entity. We do not 
seek to enforce through meaningful use 
every law and practice that may require 
submission of immunization data. We 
also make another consistency change to 
the objectives under the health care 
policy goal of improving population and 
public health. In this objective, we 
describe the capability as submitting 
electronic data. In the other objectives 
under this goal we describe the 
capability as providing electronic data. 
We believe that functionally these terms 
are interchangeable, but to avoid any 
confusion we adopt the same term of 
‘‘submit’’ electronic data across all three 
objectives. 
Comment: Some commenters 
suggested that the term ‘‘Immunization 
Information Systems (IIS)’’ has replaced 
the term ‘‘registry’’ and is referred to as 
such by the Centers for Disease Control 
(CDC). 
Response: We modified the objective 
to account for both terms. After 
consideration of the public comments 
received, we are modifying the 
meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(9)(i) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(8)(i) of our 
regulations to Capability to submit 
electronic data to immunization 
registries or Immunization Information 
Systems and actual submission in 
accordance with to applicable law and 
practice. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Performed at least one test of certified 
EHR technology’s capacity to submit 
electronic data to immunization 
registries (unless none of the 
immunization registries to which the 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH submits 
such information have the capacity to 
receive the information electronically). 
In the proposed rule, we identified 
this as an objective where more 
stringent requirements may be 
established for EPs and hospitals under 
the Medicaid program in states where 
this capability exists. This is just one 
example of a possible State proposed 
modification to meaningful use in the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program. This 
ability for the States is also included in 
our final rule. 
Comment: As with the objective of 
exchanging key clinical information, 
some commenters asked whether the 
test needs to be ‘‘live’’ or if it could be 
a ‘‘simulation’’. Some commenters 
suggested that a simulation where the 
ability was tested without being 
transmitted to another party should be 
sufficient. Others suggested that the test 
needs to include transmission or 
difficulties in actual sending 
information might not be uncovered. 
Response: As specified in the 
proposed rule, this test must involve the 
actual submission of information to a 
registry or immunization information 
system, if one exists that will accept the 
information. 
Comment: Commenters asked 
whether the use of ‘‘test’’ or ‘‘dummy’’ 
data is permissible. 
Response: While the use of test 
patient information may increase the 
risk that the system will not be testing 
to its full capability, given the privacy 
and security concerns surrounding the 
transmission of actual patient 
information we do not require it for the 
purposes of a test. Therefore, the use of 
test information about a fictional patient 
that would be identical in form to what 
would be sent about an actual patient 
would satisfy this objective. However, 
we note that this is one of the objectives 
that a State may modify in accordance 
with the discussion in II.A.2.c. of the 
proposed rule. Therefore, more stringent 
requirements may be established for EPs 
and eligible hospitals under the 
Medicaid program in states where this 
capability exists. 
Comment: Commenters expressed 
concern about the burden of multiple 
requirements for submission from 
Federal, State, and local government 
agencies or non-governmental registries. 
They also raised the issue of lack of 
standardization of means and form of 
submission. 
Response: Standards for content 
exchange and vocabulary are 
established in the ONC final rule at 45 
CFR 170.302(k). As meaningful use 
seeks to utilize certified EHR technology 
for purposes of the test and subsequent 
submission (if test was successful) these 
are the standards that should be 
utilized. While we encourage all 
providers and registries to work together 
to develop efficient, electronic 
submission of immunization 
information to all registries where it can 
be used to improve population and 
public health, for purposes of becoming 
a meaningful EHR user, we only require 
a single test and follow up submission 
if that test is successful. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
deferring the measure to a later stage 
due to the lack of a mature HIE 
infrastructure. 
Response: We agree that many areas 
of the country currently lack the 
infrastructure to support the electronic 
exchange of information. As meaningful 
use seeks to ensure certified EHR 
technology has the capability to submit 
electronic data to registries, we only 
require a single test if a receiving entity 
is available and follow up submission 
only if that test is successful. If none of 
the immunization registries to which 
the EP, eligible hospital or CAH submits 
information has the capacity to receive 
the information electronically, then this 
objective would not apply. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification whether on a failed 
attempted test satisfies the criteria of 
this measure and whether EPs in a 
group setting using identical certified 
EHR technology would only need to 
conduct a single test, not one test per 
EP. 
Response: A failed attempt would 
meet the measure. We highly encourage 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to 
work with their vendor and the 
receiving entity with whom they tested 
to identify the source of the failure and 
develop remedies, but for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use a failed attempt would 
meet the requirements. We had 
indicated in the proposed rule that only 
one test is required for EPs practicing in 
a group setting that shares the same 
certified EHR technology. We maintain 
that proposal for the final rule. 
Comment: Commenters recommended 
the inclusion of electronically reporting 
to other types of registries in addition to 
immunization registries such as disease- 
specific registries such as the Cystic 
Fibrosis Registry. 
Response: While we encourage all 
providers and registries to work together

EHR user, we only require a single test 
utilizing immunization data and follow 
up submission if that test is successful. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(9)(ii) and for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(8)(ii) of our 
regulations to ‘‘Performed at least one 
test of certified EHR technology’s 
capacity to submit electronic data to 
immunization registries and follow up 
submission if the test is successful 
(unless none of the immunization 
registries to which the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH submits such 
information have the capacity to receive 
the information electronically)’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(k). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. We require 
that an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
determine if they have given any 
immunizations during the EHR 
reporting period. Those that have not 
given any immunizations during the 
EHR reporting period are excluded from 
this measure according to the discussion 
of whether certain EP, eligible hospital 
or CAH can meet all Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives given established scopes 
of practices. If they have given 
immunizations during the reporting 
period, they should then attempt to 
locate a registry or IIS with whom to 
conduct a test of the submission of 
electronic data. This test must include 
the transfer of either actual or ‘‘dummy’’ 
data to the chosen registry or IIS. The 
testing could occur prior to the 
beginning of the EHR reporting period, 
but must occur prior to the end of the 
EHR reporting period. EPs in a group 
setting using identical certified EHR 
technology would only need to conduct 
a single test, not one test per EP. If the 
test is successful, then the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH should institute 
regular reporting to that entity in 
accordance with applicable law and 
practice. CMS will accept a yes/no 
attestation to verify all of the above for 
EPs, eligible hospitals or CAHs that 
have administered immunizations 
during the EHR reporting period. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Capability to provide electronic 
submission of reportable (as required by 
state or local law) lab results to public 
health agencies and actual submission 
where it can be received. 
In the proposed rule, we did not 
elaborate on this objective. 
Comment: A few commenters 
requested this objective be applied to 
EPs as long as the EHR Certification 
requirements are met. A commenter 
remarked that electronic submission of 
reportable lab results should not put an 
additional burden on the providers as 
the EHR would be able to automate this 
process. 
Response: We based the limitation on 
the recommendation of the HIT Policy 
Committee who in turn went through a 
considerable public development 
process. We do not believe that burden 
of reporting was the only limiting factor 
in keeping this objective from being 
applied to EPs; therefore, we maintain 
our proposal to limit this objective to 
eligible hospitals and CAHs. EPs usually 
send out lab test to other organizations 
on which reporting burdens may fall. 
Comment: Commenters requested that 
the actual transmission of the 
information be required. 
Response: In the discussion of the 
reporting immunization data objective, 
we discussed at length the need to align 
the language for the three objectives 
included under the health care policy 
priority of improve population and 
public health, which is one of the five 
priorities of the Stage 1 definition of 
meaningful use. Our interpretation is 
that the three phrases result in the same 
outcome, but introduce confusion due 
to the varied wordings. As commenters 
strongly preferred the phrase ‘‘according 
to applicable law and practice’’, we will 
so modify this objective. We do note 
however that applicable law and 
practice does not guarantee every 
receiving entity will be able to accept it 
electronically. Our measure for meeting 
this objective is one test of electronic 
data submission and if the test is 
successful, a follow up submission to 
that one entity. We do not seek to 
enforce through meaningful use every 
law and practice that may require 
submission of lab results. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(9)(i) of 
our regulations to ‘‘Capability to submit 
electronic data on reportable (as 
required by state or local law) lab results 
to public health agencies and actual 
submission in accordance with 
applicable law and practice’’. 
NPRM Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Performed at least one test of certified 
EHR technology capacity to provide 
electronic submission of reportable lab 
results to public health agencies (unless 
none of the public health agencies to 
which eligible hospital submits such 
information have the capacity to receive 
the information electronically). 
In the proposed rule, we identified 
this as an objective where more 
stringent requirements may be 
established for eligible hospitals under 
the Medicaid program in states where 
this capability exists. This is just one 
example of a possible State proposed 
modification to 
Comment: Commenters asked 
whether the test needs to be ‘‘live’’ or if 
it could be a ‘‘simulation’’. 
Response: As specified in the 
proposed rule, this test must involve the 
actual submission of information to a 
public health agency, if one exists that 
will accept the information. 
Comment: Commenters asked 
whether the use of ‘‘test’’ or ‘‘dummy’’ 
data is permissible. 
Response: While the use of test 
patient information may increase the 
risk that the system will not be testing 
to its full capability, given the privacy 
and security concerns surrounding the 
transmission of actual patient 
information we do not require it for the 
purposes of a test. Therefore, the use of 
test information about a fictional patient 
that would be identical in form to what 
would be sent about an actual patient 
would satisfy this objective. However, 
we note that this is one of the objectives 
that a State may modify as discussed 
previously in this section. Therefore, 
more stringent requirements may be 
established for EPs and eligible 
hospitals under the Medicaid program 
in states where this capability exists. 
Comment: Commenters requested that 
one national standard be established for 
reporting lab results to public health 
agencies. 
Response: Standards for content 
exchange and vocabulary are 
established in the ONC final rule at 45 
CFR 170.306(g). While we encourage all 
providers and public health agencies to 
work together to develop efficient, 
electronic submission of reportable lab 
results to all public health agencies, for 
purposes of becoming a meaningful EHR 
user, we only require a single test and 
follow up submission if that test is 
successful. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
deferring the measure to a later stage 
due to the lack of a mature HIE 
infrastructure and lack of a clear 
standard for exchanging bio- 
surveillance data. 
Response: We agree that many areas 
of the country currently lack the 
infrastructure to support the electronic 
exchange of information. As meaningful 
use seeks to ensure certified EHR

technology has the capability to submit 
electronic data to public health 
agencies, we only require a single test if 
a receiving entity is available and follow 
up submission only if that test is 
successful. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(9)(ii) of 
our regulations to ‘‘Performed at least 
one test of certified EHR technology’s 
capacity to provide electronic 
submission of reportable lab results to 
public health agencies and follow-up 
submission if the test is successful 
(unless none of the public health 
agencies to which eligible hospital or 
CAH submits such information have the 
capacity to receive the information 
electronically)’’. 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.306(g). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. Eligible 
hospitals and CAHs should attempt to 
identify one public health agency with 
whom to conduct a test of the 
submission of electronic data. This test 
must include the transfer of either 
actual or ‘‘dummy’’ data to the chosen 
public health agency. The testing could 
occur prior to the beginning of the EHR 
reporting period, but must occur prior to 
the end of the EHR reporting period. If 
the test is successful, then the eligible 
hospital or CAH should institute regular 
reporting to that entity according to 
applicable law and practice. CMS will 
accept a yes/no attestation to verify all 
of the above for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Capability to provide electronic 
syndromic surveillance data to public 
health agencies and actual transmission 
according to applicable law and 
practice. 
In the proposed rule, we did not 
elaborate on this objective. 
Comment: Half of the commenters 
commenting on this objective 
recommended that the objective be 
deferred to Stage 2 or 3 as the objective 
is considered expensive, complex and 
imposes significant administrative 
burdens on EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs unless the certified EHR 
technologies support the automate, 
electronic capture of the requisite data. 
Response: The measure for this 
objective accounts for the possibility 
that such electronic exchange of 
syndromic data is not possible. 
Standards and certification for certified 
EHR technologies are covered under the 
ONC final rule and do support the 
automatic identification of the requisite 
data and its electronic capture. This 
greatly limits the cost, complexity and 
burden of this objective. 
Comment: Commenters requested that 
an actual transmission be required. 
Response: In discussing the reporting 
immunization data objective, we 
focused on the need to align the 
language for the three objectives 
contained in under the health care 
policy priority of improving population 
and public health. Our interpretation is 
that the three phrases result in the same 
outcome, but introduce confusion with 
the current language. We adopted the 
language from this objective for the 
others. We do note however that 
applicable law and practice does not 
guarantee every receiving entity will be 
able to accept it electronically. Our 
measure for meeting this objective is 
one test of electronic data submission 
and if the test is successful, then follow 
up submission to that one entity based 
on the reporting requirements of that 
entity. We do not seek to enforce 
through meaningful use every law and 
practice that may require submission of 
lab results. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested a clarification of the term 
‘‘public health agencies.’’ 
Response: A public health agency is 
an entity under the jurisdiction of the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human 
Services, tribal organization, State level 
and/or city/county level administration 
that serves a public health function. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended that providers be 
required to satisfy either electronic 
submission to immunization registries 
or electronic submission of syndromic 
surveillance data to a public health 
agency, but not both. 
Response: We disagree. We believe 
these are fundamentally different types 
of information. Each may impose 
unique requirements in terms of ability 
to exchange information on both the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH and the 
receiving entity. Therefore, a test for one 
does not prove or disprove the ability to 
exchange information for the other. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(10)(i) and eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(10(i) of our 
regulations to ‘‘Capability to submit 
electronic syndromic surveillance data 
to public health agencies and actual 
submission in accordance with 
applicable law and practice.’’ 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Performed at least one test of certified 
EHR technology’s capacity to provide 
electronic syndromic surveillance data 
to public health agencies (unless none 
of the public health agencies to which 
an EP, eligible hospital, or CAH submits 
such information have the capacity to 
receive the information electronically). 
In the proposed rule, we identified 
this as an objective where more 
stringent requirements may be 
established for EPs and hospitals under 
the Medicaid program in states where 
this capability exists. This is just one 
example of a possible State proposed 
modification to meaningful use. 
First, a technical correction, in the 
proposed rule we incorrectly stated that 
the capability to send electronic data to 
immunization registries was included in 
the certification standards for certified 
EHR technology. We intended for this 
data to be sent to public health agencies 
and ONC in their final rule at 45 CFR 
170.304(l) correctly stated this 
capability as such. 
Comment: Commenters asked 
whether the test needs to be ‘‘live’’ or if 
it could be a ‘‘simulation’’. 
Response: As specified in the 
proposed rule, this test must involve the 
actual submission of information to a 
public health agency, if one exists that 
will accept the information. 
Comment: Commenters asked 
whether the use of ‘‘test’’ or ‘‘dummy’’ 
data is permissible. 
Response: While the use of test 
patient information may increase the 
risk that the system will not be testing 
to its full capability, given the privacy 
and security concerns surrounding the 
transmission of actual patient 
information we do not require it for the 
purposes of a test. Therefore, the use of 
test information about a fictional patient 
that would be identical in form to what 
would be sent about an actual patient 
would satisfy this objective. However, 
we note that this is one of the objectives 
that a State may modify in accordance 
with the discussion in II.A.2.c. of the 
proposed rule. Therefore, more stringent 
requirements may be established for EPs 
and eligible hospitals under the 
Medicaid program in states where this 
capability exists. 
Comment: A few commenters 
expressed confusion as to the required 
ferquency of the test. 
Response: As stated in the proposed 
rule, the required frequency of a test in 
Stage 1 for EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs is at least once prior to the end 
of the EHR reporting period. We further 
clarify that each payment year would 
require it own unique test.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
reporting syndromic surveillance data to 
public health agencies. 
Response: Standards for content 
exchange and vocabulary are 
established in the ONC final rule. While 
we encourage all providers and public 
health agencies to work together to 
develop efficient, electronic submission 
of syndromic surveillance data to all 
public health agencies, for purposes of 
becoming a meaningful EHR user, we 
only require a single test and follow up 
submission if that test is successful. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
deferring the measure to a later stage 
due to the lack of a mature HIE 
infrastructure. 
Response: We agree that many areas 
of the country currently lack the 
infrastructure to support the electronic 
exchange of information. As meaningful 
use seeks to ensure certified EHR 
technology has the capability to submit 
electronic data to public entities, we 
only require a single test if a receiving 
entity is available and follow up 
submission only if that test is 
successful. We note that this measure 
only applies if there is a public health 
agency with the capacity to receive this 
information. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification on whether a failed 
attempted test satisfies the measure and 
whether EPs in a group setting using 
identical certified EHR technology 
would only need to conduct a single 
test, not one test per EP. 
Response: A failed attempt would 
meet the measure. We highly encourage 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to 
work with their vendor and the 
receiving entity with whom they tested 
to identify the source of the failure and 
develop remedies, but for Stage 1 of 
meaningful use a failed attempt would 
meet the requirements. We had 
indicated in the proposed rule that only 
on test is required for EPs practicing in 
a group setting that shares the same 
certified EHR technology. We maintain 
that proposal for the final rule. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(e)(10)(ii) and eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(g)(10)(ii) of our 
regulations to ‘‘Performed at least one 
test of certified EHR technology’s 
capacity to provide electronic 
syndromic surveillance data to public 
health agencies and follow-up 
submission if the test is successful 
(unless none of the public health 
agencies to which an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH submits such 
information have the capacity to receive 
the information electronically.)’’ 
We further specify that in order to 
meet this objective and measure, an EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH must use the 
capabilities Certified EHR Technology 
includes as specified and standards at 
45 CFR 170.302(l). The ability to 
calculate the measure is included in 
certified EHR technology. EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs should attempt to 
identify one public health agency with 
whom to conduct a test of the 
submission of electronic data. This test 
must include the transfer of either 
actual or ‘‘dummy’’ data to the chosen 
public health agency. The testing could 
occur prior to the beginning of the EHR 
reporting period, but must occur prior to 
the end of the EHR reporting period. If 
the test is successful, then the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH should 
institute regular reporting to that entity 
according to applicable law and 
practice. CMS will accept a yes/no 
attestation to verify all of the above for 
eligible hospitals and CAHs. 
If an EP does not collect any 
reportable syndromic information on 
their patients during the EHR reporting 
period, then they are excluded from this 
measure according to the discussion of 
whether certain EP, eligible hospital or 
CAH can meet all Stage 1 meaningful 
use objectives given established scopes 
of practices. 
The fifth health outcomes policy 
priority is to ensure adequate privacy 
and security protections for personal 
health information. The following care 
goals for meaningful use address this 
priority: 
• Ensure privacy and security 
protections for confidential information 
through operating policies, procedures, 
and technologies and compliance with 
applicable law. 
• Provide transparency of data 
sharing to patient. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Objective: 
Protect electronic health information 
created or maintained by the certified 
EHR technology through the 
implementation of appropriate technical 
capabilities. 
In the proposed rule, we discussed 
how we were relating the objectives 
presented by the HIT Policy committee 
more tightly to the meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology as opposed to 
the broader success of the EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH in ensuring privacy and 
security. The primary reason we gave 
was that the proper vehicle for ensuring 
privacy and security is the HIPAA 
Privacy and Security Act and that we 
sought with this objective to ensure that 
certified EHR technology does not 
impede an EP’s, eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s ability to comply with HIPAA. 
Comment: We received considerable 
support from many commenters who 
supported this objective and measure as 
proposed. 
Response: We appreciate the support 
of these commenters for our proposed 
objective and measure. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification of appropriate technical 
capabilities. 
Response: The ONC final rule 
specifies certain capabilities that must 
be in certified EHR technology. For the 
objective we simply mean that a 
technical capability would be 
appropriate if it protected the electronic 
health information created or 
maintained by the certified EHR 
technology. All of these capabilities 
could be part of the certified EHR 
technology or outside systems and 
programs that support the privacy and 
security of certified EHR technology. We 
could not develop an exhaustive list. 
Furthermore as we state in the proposed 
rule compliance with HIPAA privacy 
and security rules is required for all 
covered entities, regardless of whether 
or not they participate in the EHR 
incentive programs. Furthermore, 
compliance with the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rules constitutes a wide 
range of activities, procedures and 
infrastructure. We rephrased the 
objective to ensure that meaningful use 
of the certified EHR technology supports 
compliance with the HIPAA Privacy 
and Security Rules and compliance with 
fair sharing data practices outlined in 
the Nationwide Privacy and Security 
Framework (http://healthit.hhs.gov/
portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGSl0l
10731l848088l0l0l18/ 
NationwidePSlFramework-5.pdf), but 
do not believe meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology is the 
appropriate regulatory tool to ensure 
such compliance with the HIPAA 
Privacy and Security Rules. 
Comment: Several commenters urged 
CMS not to finalized requirements for 
the fair data sharing practices set forth 
in the Nationwide Privacy and Security 
Framework and to clarify the policies to 
which CMS is referring. 
Response: While we stated in the 
proposed rule we rephrased the 
objective to ensure ‘‘compliance with 
fair sharing data practices outline in the 
Nationwide Privacy and Security 
Framework,’’ we did not propose any 
practices or policies related to the 
Nationwide Privacy and Security 
Framework and do not finalize any in 
this final rule. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested the elimination of this 
objective as redundant to HIPAA.

 44369 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Response: We do not see meaningful 
use as an appropriate regulatory tool to 
impose different, additional, and/or 
inconsistent privacy and security policy 
requirements from those policies 
already required by HIPAA. With that 
said, we do feel it is crucial that EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs evaluate 
the impact certified EHR technology has 
on their compliance with HIPAA and 
the protection of health information in 
general. Therefore, we retain this 
objective and measure for meaningful 
use in the final rule. 
Comment: We received hundreds of 
comments that requested the 
cancelation of the EHR incentive 
payment program due to the privacy 
and security risks imposed by the 
implementation and use of certified 
EHR technology. 
Response: We are required by the 
ARRA to implement the EHR incentive 
programs and cannot cancel them. We 
seek to mitigate the risks to the security 
and privacy of patient information by 
requiring EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs to conduct or review a security 
risk analysis in accordance with the 
requirements under 45 CFR 164.308 
(a)(1) and implement security updates 
as necessary. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the meaningful use objective for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(15)(i) and eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(f)(14)(i) of our 
regulations as proposed. 
We include this objective in the core 
set. We believe maintaining privacy and 
security is crucial for every EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH that uses certified EHR 
technology and was recommended by 
the HIT Policy Committee for inclusion 
in the core set. 
NPRM EP/Eligible Hospital Measure: 
Conduct or review a security risk 
analysis in accordance with the 
requirements under 45 CFR 164.308 
(a)(1) and implement security updates 
as necessary. 
In the proposed rule, we discussed 
the role of certified EHR technology in 
privacy and security. We said that while 
certified EHR technology provides tools 
for protecting health information, it is 
not a full protection solution. Processes 
and possibly tools outside the scope of 
certified EHR technology are required. 
Therefore, for the Stage 1 criteria of 
meaningful use we propose that EPs and 
eligible hospitals conduct or review a 
security risk analysis of certified EHR 
technology and implement updates as 
necessary at least once prior to the end 
of the EHR reporting period and attest 
to that conduct or review. The testing 
could occur prior to the beginning of the 
EHR reporting period. This is to ensure 
that the certified EHR technology is 
playing its role in the overall strategy of 
the EP or eligible hospital in protecting 
health information. We have maintained 
this discussion for the final rule, but 
modified the measure to account for 
requests discussed in the comment and 
response section below. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification of the phrase 
‘‘implement security updates as 
necessary’’. 
Response: A security update would be 
required if any security deficiencies 
were identified during the risk analysis. 
A security update could be updated 
software for certified EHR technology to 
be implemented as soon as available, to 
changes in workflow processes, or 
storage methods or any other necessary 
corrective action that needs to take 
place in order to eliminate the security 
deficiency or deficiencies identified in 
the risk analysis. To provide better 
clarity on this requirement, we are 
modifying the measure. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the meaningful use measure for EPs at 
§ 495.6(d)(15)(ii) and eligible hospitals 
and CAHs at § 495.6(f)(14)(ii) of our 
regulations ‘‘Conduct or review a 
security risk analysis per 45 CFR 
164.308(a)(1) of the certified EHR 
technology, and implement security 
updates and correct identified security 
deficiencies as part of its risk 
management process.’’

3 For purposes of this final rule, the term ‘‘eligible 
hospital’’ for the Medicaid EHR incentive program 
is inclusive of Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) as 
defined in this final rule. 
BILLING CODE 4120–01–C 
3. Sections 4101(a) and 4102(a)(1) of the 
HITECH Act: Reporting on Clinical 
Quality Measures Using EHRs by EPs, 
Eligible Hospitals, and CAHs 3 
a. General 
As discussed in the meaningful use 
background in section II.A.2.a. there are 
three elements of meaningful use. In 
this section, we discuss the third 
requirement: using certified EHR 
technology, the EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH submits to the Secretary, in a form 
and manner specified by the Secretary, 
information for the EHR reporting 
period on clinical quality measures and 
other measures specified by the 
Secretary. The submission of other 
measures is discussed in section II.A.2.c 
of this final rule. The two other 
elements of meaningful use are 
discussed in section II.A.2.d.1 of this 
final rule. 
b. Requirements for the Submission of 
Clinical Quality Measures by EPs, 
Eligible Hospitals, and CAHs 
Sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(ii) and 
1886(n)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act provide that 
the Secretary may not require the 
electronic reporting of information on 
clinical quality measures unless the 
Secretary has the capacity to accept the 
information electronically, which may 
be on a pilot basis. 
In the proposed rule, we stated that 
we do not anticipate that HHS will 
complete the necessary steps for us to 
have the capacity to electronically 
accept data on clinical quality measures 
from EHRs for the 2011 payment year. 
We believe that it is unlikely that by 
2011 there will be adequate testing and 
demonstration of the ability to receive 
the required transmitted information on 
a widespread basis. The capacity to 
accept information on clinical quality 
measures also would depend upon the 
Secretary promulgating technical 
specifications for EHR vendors with 
respect to the transmission of 
information on clinical quality measures 
sufficiently in advance of the EHR 
reporting period for 2011, so that 
adequate time has been provided either 
for such specifications to be certified, or 
for EHR vendors to code such 
specifications into certified systems. 
Therefore, for 2011, we proposed that 
Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs use an attestation methodology to 
submit summary information to us on 
clinical quality measures as a condition 
of demonstrating meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology, rather than 
electronic submission. 
We proposed that from the Medicaid 
perspective, delaying the onset of 
clinical quality measures electronic 
reporting until 2012 addresses concerns 
about States having the ready 
infrastructure to receive and store 
clinical quality measures data before 
then. More importantly, we recognized 
that since Medicaid providers are 
eligible to receive incentive payments 
for adopting, implementing, or 
upgrading certified EHR technology, 
Medicaid providers may not be focused 
on demonstrating meaningful use until 
2012 or later. 
We stated that we anticipate that for 
the 2012 payment year we will have 
completed the necessary steps to have 
the capacity to receive electronically 
information on clinical quality measures 
from EHRs, including the promulgation 
of technical specifications for EHR 
vendors to use for obtaining certification 
of their systems. Therefore, for the 
Medicare EHR incentive program 
beginning in CY 2012 we proposed that 
an EP using a certified EHR technology 
or beginning in FY 2012 an eligible 
hospital or CAH using a certified EHR 
technology, as appropriate for clinical 
quality measures, must submit 
information on clinical quality measures 
electronically, in addition to submitting 
the other measures described in section 
II.2.d.2, in order for the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH to be a meaningful 
EHR user, regardless of whether CY 
2012 is their first or second payment 
year. However, if the Secretary does not 
have the capacity to accept the 
information on clinical quality measures 
electronically in 2012, consistent with 
sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(ii) and 
1886(n)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act, we will 
continue to rely on an attestation 
methodology for reporting of clinical 
quality measures as a requirement for 
demonstrating meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology for payment 
year 2012. We stated in the proposed 
rule that should we not have the 
capacity to accept information on 
clinical quality measures electronically 
in 2012, we would inform the public of 
this fact by publishing a notice in the 
Federal Register and providing 
instructions on how this information 
should be submitted to us. 
We also are finalizing in this final rule 
that States must identify for us in their 
State Medicaid HIT Plans how they plan 
to accept data from Medicaid providers 
who seek to demonstrate meaningful 
use by reporting on clinical quality 
measures, either via attestation or via 
electronic reporting, subject to our prior 
approval. If they initiate their program 
by accepting attestations for clinical 
quality measures, they must also 
describe how they will inform providers 
of their timeframe to accept submission 
of clinical quality measures 
electronically. We expect that States 
will have the capacity to accept 
electronic reporting of clinical quality 
measures by their second year 
implementing their Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. 
For purposes of the requirements 
under sections 1848(o)(2)(A)(iii) and 
1886(n)(3)(iii) of the Act, we defined 
‘‘clinical quality measures’’ to consist of 
measures of processes, experience, and/ 
or outcomes of patient care, 
observations or treatment that relate to 
one or more quality aims for health care 
such as effective, safe, efficient, patient- 
centered, equitable, and timely care. We 
noted that certain statutory limitations 
apply only to the reporting of clinical 
quality measures, such as the 
requirement discussed in the previous 
paragraph prohibiting the Secretary 
from requiring the electronic reporting 
of information on clinical quality 
measures unless the Secretary has the 
capacity to accept the information 
electronically, as well as other statutory 
requirements for clinical quality 
measures that are discussed below in

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
section II.A.3.c.1 of this final rule. These 
limitations apply solely to the 
submission of clinical quality measures, 
and do not apply to other measures of 
meaningful EHR use. The clinical 
quality measures on which EPs, eligible 
hospitals, or CAHs will be required to 
submit information using certified EHR 
technology, the statutory requirements 
and other considerations that were used 
to select these measures, and the 
reporting requirements are described 
below. 
With respect to Medicaid EPs and 
eligible hospitals, we noted that section 
1903(t)(6) of the Act recognizes that the 
demonstration of meaningful use may 
also include the reporting of clinical 
quality measures to the States. We 
proposed that in the interest of 
simplifying the program and guarding 
against duplication of meaningful use 
criteria, the clinical quality measures 
adopted for the Medicare EHR incentive 
program, would also apply to EPs and 
eligible hospitals in the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. 
Despite the statutory limitation 
prohibiting the Secretary from requiring 
the electronic submission of clinical 
quality measures in the Medicare EHR 
incentive program, if HHS does not have 
the capacity to accept this information 
electronically, as previously discussed, 
the Secretary has broad discretion to 
establish requirements for meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology and for 
the demonstration of such use by EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs. Although 
we proposed to require the electronic 
submission of information on clinical 
quality measures in 2012, we stated that 
we do not desire this to delay the use 
of certified EHR technology by EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs to measure 
and improve clinical quality. 
Specifically, we stated that using EHR 
functionalities that support 
measurement of clinical quality is 
critical to a central goal of the HITECH 
Act, improving health care quality. 
Measuring quality is a fundamental 
aspect of improving such quality, 
because it allows EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs to receive quantitative 
information upon which they can then 
act in order to improve quality. 
Accordingly, although we did not 
propose under sections 
1848(o)(2)(A)(iii) and 1886(n)(3)(A)(iii) 
of the Act to require that for 2011 EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs report 
clinical quality measures to us or States 
electronically, we proposed to require as 
an additional condition of 
demonstrating meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology under sections 
1848(o)(2)(A)(i), 1886(n)(3)(A)(ii), and 
1903(t)(6) of the Act that EPs and 
eligible hospitals use certified EHR 
technology to capture the data elements 
and calculate the results for certain 
clinical quality measures. Further, we 
proposed that EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs demonstrate that they have 
satisfied this requirement during the 
EHR reporting period for 2011 through 
attestation. We also proposed to require 
that Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs attest to the accuracy and 
completeness of the numerators and 
denominators for each of the applicable 
measures. Finally, in accordance with 
our authority under sections 
1848(o)(C)(i)(V) and 1886(n)(3)(C)(i)(V) 
of the Act, which grants us broad 
discretion to specify the means through 
which EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs 
demonstrate compliance with the 
meaningful use criteria, we proposed 
that EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs 
demonstrate their use of certified EHR 
technology to capture the data elements 
and calculate the results for the 
applicable clinical quality measures by 
reporting the results to us for all 
applicable patients. For the Medicaid 
incentive program, we proposed that 
States may accept provider attestations 
in the same manner to demonstrate 
meaningful use in 2011. However, we 
indicated that we expect that most 
Medicaid providers will qualify for the 
incentive payment by adopting, 
implementing, or upgrading to certified 
EHR technology, and therefore will not 
need to attest to meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology in 2011, for 
their first payment year. 
We stated that we recognize that 
considerable work needs to be done by 
measure owners and developers with 
respect to the clinical quality measures 
that we proposed. This includes 
completing electronic specifications for 
measures, implementing such 
specifications into EHR technology to 
capture and calculate the results, and 
implementing the systems, themselves. 
We also recognized that some measures 
are further developed than others, as 
discussed in the measures section (see 
75 FR 1871) of the proposed rule. 
Nevertheless we stated our belief that 
overall there is sufficient time to 
complete work on measures and 
measures specifications so as to allow 
vendors and EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs to implement such systems. We 
stated that it was our intention not to 
finalize those specific measures should 
the necessary work on measure 
specifications not be completed for 
particular measures according to the 
timetable we discuss below. As we 
discuss below, we finalize in this final 
rule only those clinical quality measures 
for which clearly defined electronic 
specifications have been finalized by the 
date of display of this final rule. 
Finalized clinical quality measures are 
listed in Table 6 for EPs and Table 7 for 
eligible hospitals and CAHs. We also 
clarify that while States may not have 
the capacity to accept electronic 
reporting of clinical quality measures in 
2011 or their first year implementing 
their Medicaid EHR incentive program, 
we expect that they will have such 
capacity by their second 
implementation year. However, if they 
do not, as with the Federal government, 
the State would continue to rely on an 
attestation methodology for reporting 
clinical quality measures as a 
requirement for demonstrating 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology, subject to CMS prior 
approval via an updated State Medicaid 
HIT plan. 
Comment: A few commenters 
requested that the definition of ‘‘clinical 
quality measures’’ be expanded to 
include ‘‘appropriate clinical 
prevention.’’ 
Response: We agree that appropriate 
clinical prevention is a pertinent topic 
for clinical quality measures, but we do 
not believe the definition of clinical 
quality measures needs to delineate 
every aspect of quality care included in 
the definition. 
Comment: Several commenters said it 
will be difficult to develop the EHR 
capability to capture, integrate and train 
staff regarding measure specifications if 
the clinical quality measures are not 
posted with sufficient time to allow 
these activities. Other commenters said 
there is insufficient time allowed for 
vendors to retool their products and 
complete development of the reports 
and/or systems. Several commenters 
indicated that the clinical quality 
measures have not been tested, and 
reliability and validity testing should be 
performed. Other commenters indicated 
that standard, clearly defined electronic 
specifications do not exist and new 
specifications should be pilot tested and 
published for stakeholder/public 
comment. A commenter requested that 
CMS establish an explicit process for 
development and testing of evidence 
based electronically specified measures 
(eMeasure), and ensure adequate time 
for field testing. 
Response: In general we agree with 
the desirability of having electronic 
specifications available, pilot tested, 
and published for stakeholder viewing 
sufficiently in advance so as to allow 
adequate time for modifications if 
necessary and vendors to incorporate 
them into certified EHR technology, and 
for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
integrate the measures into their 
operations and train staff on the 
measures. In this case, however, there is 
a process for certification of certified 
EHR technology which includes testing 
of the capability of the certified EHR. 
The final rule issued by ONC (found 
elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 
Register) provides that certified EHR 
technology must have the ability to 
calculate clinical quality measures as 
specified by us. We interpret this 
requirement to mean that certified EHR 
technology must have the capability to 
calculate those clinical quality measures 
selected in this final rule based on the 
specifications we select and post on the 
CMS Web site. In order to provide 
sufficient time for vendors to retool 
their products and complete 
development of the necessary reports 
and/or systems for calculation of the 
results for the required clinical quality 
measures, and for certifying bodies to 
test and certify that EHR technologies 
adequately do so, we are adopting only 
those electronic specifications that are 
posted on the CMS Web site as of the 
date of display of this final rule. We 
believe testing that is part of the process 
for certification of EHR technology will 
substitute for testing that might 
otherwise occur. Additionally, some of 
the selected measures have undergone 
various amounts of testing already. For 
example, the Emergency Department 
Throughput, Stroke and Venous 
Thromboembolism (VTE) measures 
mentioned by the commenter were 
tested during the January 2010 
Connectathon and demonstrated at the 
Health Information and Management 
Systems Society (HIMSS) 2010 
Interoperability Showcase which 
demonstrated the use of the measures by 
participating vendors. However, we 
expect the EHR certification process to 
carry out the necessary testing to assure 
that applicable certified EHR technology 
can calculate sufficient number of EP, 
eligible hospital and CAH clinical 
quality measures required to qualify for 
the meaningful use incentive program. 
In order to permit greater participation 
by EHR vendors, including specialty 
EHRs, the certification program (see 
ONC final rule found elsewhere in this 
issue of the Federal Register) will 
permit EHRs to be certified if they are 
able to calculate at a minimum three 
clinical quality measures in addition to 
the six core and alternative core 
measures. In addition, the fact that EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs can adopt 
an EHR reporting period toward the end 
of FY/CY 2011, we believe, will provide 
additional time for providers to 
implement and train staff on the 
measures we adopt in this final rule. 
c. Statutory Requirements and Other 
Considerations for the Selection of 
Clinical Quality Measures for Electronic 
Submission by EPs, Eligible Hospitals, 
and CAHs 
(1) Statutory Requirements for the 
Selection of Clinical Quality Measures 
for Electronic Submission by EPs, 
Eligible Hospitals, and CAHs 
Sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(i)(II) and 
1886(n)(3)(B)(i) of the Act require that 
prior to any clinical quality measure 
being selected, the Secretary will 
publish in the Federal Register such 
measure and provide for a period of 
public comment on such measure. The 
proposed clinical quality measures for 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs for 
2011 and 2012 payment were listed in 
Tables 3 through 21 of the proposed rule 
(see 75 FR 1874 through 1900). 
In the proposed rule, we noted that 
for purposes of selecting clinical quality 
measures on which EPs will be required 
to submit information using certified 
EHR technology, section 
1848(o)(2)(B)(i)(I) of the Act, as added 
by section 4101 of the HITECH Act, 
states that the Secretary shall provide 
preference to clinical quality measures 
that have been endorsed by the entity 
with a contract with the Secretary under 
section 1890(a) of the Act, as added by 
section 183 of the Medicare 
Improvement for Patients and Providers 
Act (MIPPA) of 2008. For submission of 
clinical quality measures by eligible 
hospitals and CAHs, section 
1886(n)(3)(B)(i)(I) of the Act, as added 
by section 4102(a) of the HITECH Act, 
requires the Secretary to provide 
preference to those clinical quality 
measures that have been endorsed by 
the entity with a contract with the 
Secretary under section 1890(a) of the 
Act, as added by section 183 of the 
MIPPA, or clinical quality measures that 
have been selected for the purpose of 
applying section 1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of 
the Act (that is, measures that have been 
selected for the Reporting Hospital 
Quality Data for Annual Payment 
Update (RHQDAPU) program). 
On January 14, 2009, the U.S. 
Department of Health and Human 
Services awarded the contract required 
under section 1890(a) of the Act to the 
National Quality Forum (NQF). 
Therefore, we explained in the proposed 
rule that when selecting the clinical 
quality measures EPs must report in 
order to demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology in accordance 
with section 1848(o)(2)(B)(i)(I) of the 
Act, we will give preference to the 
clinical quality measures endorsed by 
the NQF, including NQF endorsed 
measures that have previously been 
selected for the Physician Quality 
Reporting Initiative (PQRI) program. 
Similarly, we stated that when selecting 
the clinical quality measures eligible 
hospitals and CAHs must report in order 
to demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology in accordance 
with section 1886(n)(3)(B)(i)(I) of the 
Act, we will give preference to the 
clinical quality measures selected from 
those endorsed by the NQF or that have 
previously been selected for the 
RHQDAPU program. In some instances 
we proposed measures for EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs that are not 
currently NQF endorsed in an effort to 
include a broader set of clinical quality 
measures. In the proposed rule, we 
noted that the HITECH Act does not 
require the use of NQF endorsed 
measures, nor limit the measures to 
those included in PQRI or RHQDAPU. 
We stated that if we, professional 
societies, or other stakeholders identify 
clinical quality measures which may be 
appropriate for the EHR incentive 
programs, we will consider those 
measures even if they are not endorsed 
by the NQF or have not been selected 
for the PQRI or RHQDAPU programs, 
subject to the requirement to publish in 
the Federal Register such measure(s) for 
a period of public comment. 
We proposed certain clinical quality 
measures for EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs, and listed these measures in 
Tables 3 through 21 of the proposed rule 
(see 75 FR 1874–1900) for use in the 
2011 and 2012 payment years. We 
stated that no changes (that is, additions 
of clinical quality measures) would be 
made after publication of the final rule, 
except through further rulemaking. 
However, we stated that we may make 
administrative and/or technical 
modifications or refinements, such as 
revisions to the clinical quality 
measures titles and code additions, 
corrections, or revisions to the detailed 
specifications for the 2011 and 2012 
payment year measures. We stated that 
the 2011 specifications for user 
submission of clinical quality measures 
would be available on our Web site 
when they are sufficiently developed or 
finalized. Specifications for the EHR 
incentive programs must be obtained 
only from the specifications documents 
for the EHR incentive program clinical 
quality measures. 
Comment: Numerous comments were 
received regarding the criteria for 
selection of clinical quality measures. 
Some commenters noted the importance 
of scientific and medical evidence 
supporting the measure, as well as

concerns regarding how the clinical 
quality measures are maintained. Many 
other commenters indicated that all 
clinical quality measures should be 
evidence-based and up-to-date with 
current medical standards. Several 
commenters communicated support for 
using NQF; Hospital Quality Alliance 
(HQA); Ambulatory care Quality 
Alliance (AQA); and the American 
Medical Association-Physician 
Consortium for Performance 
Improvement (AMA–PCPI) clinical 
quality measures. Another commenter 
suggested that measures that have a 
related U.S. Preventative Services Task 
Force (USPSTF) recommendation 
should follow the USPSTF guidelines 
and the regulations should allow for 
clinical quality measures to be updated 
as the evidence base changes. Another 
commenter indicated CMS should 
ensure that all clinical quality measures 
are endorsed through a stakeholder 
consensus process. Commenters also 
questioned why some clinical quality 
measures in the proposed rule do not 
have identifiers for example, NQF 
number and another commenter 
indicated some of the clinical quality 
measures titles were different in the 
clinical quality measure tables. Some 
commenters also stated that clinical 
quality measures should be phased in, 
implementing the clinical quality 
measures by clinically related sets, and 
that all CMS proposed clinical quality 
measures should be NQF endorsed. 
Some commenters suggested that 
CMS should consult with other quality 
measure stakeholders, such as, NQF, the 
Hospital Quality Alliance (HQA), and 
the National Committee for Quality 
Assurance (NCQA), The Joint 
Commission (TJC), and Regional Health 
Improvement Collaboratives to verify 
the validity, reliability, and 
appropriateness of proposed clinical 
measures. In addition when developing, 
validating and recommending clinical 
quality measures for the pediatric 
population, a commenter suggested 
CMS include consultation with the 
Child Healthcare Corporation of 
America (CHCA) or the National 
Association of Children’s Hospitals 
(NACHRI). 
Response: The HITECH Act requires 
that we give preference to clinical 
quality measures that are NQF 
endorsed. NQF is the only organization 
that we are aware of which is in 
compliance with the requirements of 
National Technology Transfer and 
Advancement Act (NTTAA), to endorse 
quality measures through voluntary 
consensus standards. However, the 
HITECH Act does not require the 
exclusive use of NQF endorsed 
measures, nor limit the measures to 
those produced by any particular 
developer or adopted or supported by 
any particular organization, such as 
those suggested by the commenters. We 
gave preference to NQF endorsed 
clinical quality measures in this final 
rule. However, we do not adopt a policy 
that would restrict the Secretary’s 
discretion of beyond what is required by 
the statute. Measures listed in the 
proposed rule that did not have an NQF 
identifying number were not NQF 
endorsed. 
With respect to specific organizations, 
we have received broad input regarding 
clinical quality measures including from 
many organizations mentioned by 
commenters and have considered their 
comments in determining which 
clinical quality measures to finalize in 
this final rule. We also note that, for 
NQF endorsed measures, the NQF 
provides a venue for public and member 
input as a part of the endorsement 
process. With respect to commenters 
urging consideration of whether the 
scientific and medical evidence support 
the measure, whether the clinical 
quality measures are evidence-based 
and consistent with current medical 
standards, and how the clinical quality 
measures are maintained, we note that 
these factors are part of the NQF 
process, as well as standard measure 
development processes. We are 
committed to working with national, 
State and local associations to identify 
or develop additional electronically 
specified clinical quality measures, 
particularly for pediatric populations, 
for later stages of meaningful use. 
In selecting clinical quality measures 
for the Medicare EHR incentive 
program, the Secretary is required to 
provide for notice in the Federal 
Register with public comment. This 
provides broad public input which we 
fully consider. However, as we stated in 
the proposed rule, we are finalizing the 
policy that technical specifications for 
clinical quality measures are developed 
and finalized through the sub-regulatory 
process. Further, this requirement does 
not pertain to the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. We expect to 
develop a process in the future to solicit 
public input on Medicaid-specific 
clinical quality measures for future 
stages of meaningful use, if needed. 
However, because there are no such 
Medicaid-specific measures in this final 
rule, and all measures apply uniformly 
across both the Medicare and Medicaid 
EHR incentive program, we have not 
developed such a process in this final 
rule. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, the HITECH Act 
requires that we give preference to 
clinical quality measures that are NQF 
endorsed. However, it does not require 
the exclusive use of NQF endorsed 
measures, nor limit the measures to 
those produced by any particular 
developer nor be adopted by any 
particular organization. In this case, all 
clinical quality measures we are 
finalizing are NQF endorsed and have 
current electronic specifications as of 
the date of display of this final rule. 
Effective with the publication of this 
final rule, these specifications are final 
for clinical quality measure reporting 
under the HITECH Act beginning with 
2011 and 2012. The detailed electronic 
specifications of the clinical quality 
measures for EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs are displayed on the CMS Web 
site at http://www.cms.gov/
QualityMeasures/03_Electronic
Specifications.asp#TopOfPage. 
Sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(iii) and 
1886(n)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act requires that 
in selecting clinical quality measures, 
the Secretary shall seek to avoid 
redundant or duplicative reporting 
otherwise required, including reporting 
under section 1848(k)(2)(C) of the Act 
(the PQRI program) and eligible 
reporting under section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii) of the Act 
(RHQDAPU program). For EPs, when 
the proposed rule was issued there was 
no statutory authority to provide PQRI 
incentive payments for services 
furnished for 2011 or subsequent years. 
Since then, the PQRI incentive payment 
for 2011 has been authorized. We 
acknowledge there is overlap within the 
clinical quality measure reporting for 
EPs in the EHR incentive program with 
the PQRI incentive program. However, 
the reporting periods in these two 
incentive programs are different. 
Currently, the PQRI has a six and a 
twelve month reporting period. The 
reporting period for the HITECH EHR 
incentive program for the first payment 
year is 90 days, which does not meet the 
PQRI reporting requirement of six or 
twelve month reporting period, as 
currently provided. However, in the 
second payment year of the HITECH 
EHR incentive program the reporting 
period is one year, and the PQRI 
reporting period, would be 
synchronous. The requirement for 
qualification for PQRI is subject to a 
separate regulation. Although there may 
be additional issues beyond the 
reporting periods, we anticipate efforts 
to avoid redundant and duplicative 
reporting in PQRI of the same clinical 
quality measures as required in the EHR 
incentive program. We envision a single 
reporting infrastructure for electronic

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
submission in the future, and will strive 
to align the EHR incentive program and 
PQRI as we develop the reporting 
framework for clinical quality measures 
to avoid redundant or duplicative 
reporting. Further, we also note that the 
Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111–148) 
requires that the Secretary develop a 
plan to integrate the EHR incentive 
program and PQRI by January 1, 2012. 
In doing so we expect to further address 
the issue of redundant and duplicative 
reporting. For eligible hospitals and 
CAHs, for the EHR incentive program, 
we are finalizing one set of 15 clinical 
quality measures for both Medicare and 
Medicaid. For Stage 1 (for clinical 
quality measures Stage 1 is 2011 and 
beginning in 2012), none of the finalized 
15 clinical quality measures for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs are currently 
included in the RHQDAPU program, 
and therefore there is no issue of 
redundant and duplicative reporting 
based upon the HITECH Act. 
Nevertheless, clinical quality measures 
in the EHR incentive program for 
eligible hospitals and CAHs were 
electronically specified for use in the 
RHQDAPU program with the 
anticipation to place these measures in 
RHQDAPU once we have completed 
and implemented the mechanism to 
accept quality measures through 
electronic submission. For the future, 
we do not anticipate having one set of 
clinical quality measures for the EHR 
incentive program and another set for 
RHQDAPU. Rather, we anticipate a 
single set of hospital clinical quality 
measures, most of which we anticipate 
can be electronically specified. We note 
some of the RHQDAPU quality 
measures, for example HCAHPS 
experience of care measures, do not 
lend themselves to EHR reporting. 
Similarly, certain outcome quality 
measures, such as the current 
RQHDAPU readmission measures, are 
based on claims rather than clinical 
data. In the future, we anticipate 
hospitals that report RHQDAPU 
measures electronically would receive 
incentives from both the RHQDAPU and 
EHR incentive program, in addition to 
properly reporting any required quality 
measures that are not able to be derived 
from EHRs; this is however subject to 
future rulemaking. Further, in the 
future, for hospitals that do not report 
electronically we anticipate that they 
may only qualify for an incentive 
through the RHQDAPU program, and 
not through the EHR incentive program. 
Again this is subject to future 
rulemaking. We envision a single 
reporting infrastructure for electronic 
submission in the future, and will strive 
to align the hospital quality initiative 
programs to seek to avoid redundant 
and duplicative reporting of quality 
measures for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs. 
Comment: Many commenters also 
suggested aligning clinical quality 
measure reporting across federal 
agencies (for example, HRSA, CMS) as 
well as across programs, (for example, 
PQRI, CHIP, Medicare and Medicaid) to 
avoid duplicative and redundant quality 
performance reporting. Additionally, 
several commenters suggested that 
similar clinical quality measures and/or 
quality data efforts included in the 
proposed rule are included in other 
clinical quality recognition programs 
and EPs who successfully report in 
these programs via a certified EHR 
should be deemed to have successfully 
reported in the EHR incentive program. 
Other commenters suggested using the 
PQRI reporting process to satisfy the 
meaningful use requirement under the 
EHR incentive program for EPs. Another 
commenter indicated that clinical 
quality measures employed by this 
program and others will be valuable if 
EPs using EHRs have an in-depth 
understanding of how to leverage the 
technology and the data they produce to 
improve care. A number of commenters 
requested that only clinical quality 
measures chosen for use in the 
RHQDAPU program should be 
considered for implementation in the 
EHR incentive program for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs that qualify for both 
incentives. Additionally, the 
commenters stated they would like the 
process for avoiding duplicative 
reporting clearly defined. 
Response: The HITECH Act requires 
that the Secretary seek to avoid 
redundant and duplicative reporting, 
with specific reference to PQRI for EPs 
and RHQDAPU for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs. We have sought to avoid 
duplicative and redundant reporting in 
the implementation of the HITECH Act 
as discussed elsewhere in our responses 
to comments in this final rule. We will 
seek to align quality initiative programs 
in future rulemaking. 
(2) Other Considerations for the 
Selection of Clinical Quality Measures 
for Electronic Submission by EPs, 
Eligible Hospitals, and CAHs 
In addition to the requirements under 
sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(i)(I) and 
1886(n)(3)(B)(i)(I) of the Act and the 
other statutory requirements described 
above, we also proposed applying the 
following considerations to the selection 
of the clinical quality measures for 
electronic submission under the 
Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive 
programs: 
• Clinical quality measures that are 
included in, facilitate alignment with, or 
allow determination of satisfactory 
reporting in other Medicare (for 
example, PQRI or the RHQDAPU 
program), Medicaid, and Children’s 
Health Insurance Program (CHIP) 
program priorities. 
• Clinical quality measures that are 
widely applicable to EPs and eligible 
hospitals based on the services provided 
for the population of patients seen. 
• Clinical quality measures that 
promote CMS and HHS policy priorities 
related to improved quality and 
efficiency of care for the Medicare and 
Medicaid populations that would allow 
us to track improvement in care over 
time. These current and long term 
priority topics include: prevention; 
management of chronic conditions; high 
cost and high volume conditions; 
elimination of health disparities; 
healthcare-associated infections and 
other conditions; improved care 
coordination; improved efficiency; 
improved patient and family experience 
of care; improved end-of-life/palliative 
care; effective management of acute and 
chronic episodes of care; reduced 
unwarranted geographic variation in 
quality and efficiency; and adoption and 
use of interoperable HIT. 
• Clinical quality measures that 
address or relate to known gaps in the 
quality of care and measures that 
through the PQRI program, performed at 
low or highly variable rates. 
• Clinical quality measures that have 
been recommended for inclusion in the 
EHR incentive by the HIT Policy 
Committee. 
We noted in the proposed rule that 
the Children’s Health Insurance 
Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) 
of 2009 (Pub. L. 111–3) Title IV, section 
401 requires the Secretary to publish a 
core set of clinical quality measures for 
the pediatric population. We stated that, 
to the extent possible, we would align 
the clinical quality measures selected 
under the EHR incentive program with 
the measures selected under the 
CHIPRA core measure set. Included in 
the proposed clinical quality measures 
were nine clinical quality measures 
pertaining to pediatric providers. Four 
of these nine measures were on the list 
of CHIPRA initial core measures that 
were recommended to the Secretary by 
the Subcommittee to AHRQ’s National 
Advisory Committee (SNAC). In our 
proposed rule, we noted that not all 
CHIPRA initial measures recommended 
to the Secretary were applicable to EHR 
technology or to the EHR incentive 
payment program. For example, some of

 44385 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
the measures are population-based, 
survey-derived, or not yet NQF 
endorsed. We stated that new or 
additional measures for the next 
iteration of the CHIPRA core set would 
have EHR extractability as a priority. 
Since the publication of the proposed 
rule, the CHIPRA core measure set has 
been published in a final rule (see 74 FR 
68846 through 68849). In this EHR 
incentive program final rule, there are 
four clinical quality measures that are 
also in the published CHIPRA initial 
core measure set. These clinical quality 
measures are shown below in Table 4: 
Due to the concurrent CHIPRA and 
ARRA HIT implementation activities, 
we believe there is an exciting 
opportunity to align the two programs 
and strive to create efficiencies for 
States and pediatric providers, where 
applicable. Similarly, the adult quality 
measures requirements enacted in the 
ACA will provide another opportunity 
for CMS to align its quality measures 
programs for consistency and to 
maximize use of electronic reporting. As 
these programs move forward, we will 
continue to prioritize consistency in 
clinical quality measure selection for 
providers when possible. 
We solicited comments on the 
inclusion or exclusion of any clinical 
quality measure or measures proposed 
for the 2011 and 2012 payment years, 
and to our approach in selecting clinical 
quality measures. 
We stated in the proposed rule that 
we do not intend to use notice and 
comment rulemaking as a means to 
update or modify clinical quality 
measure specifications. A clinical 
quality measure that has completed the 
consensus process through NQF has a 
designated party (usually, the measure 
developer/owner) who has accepted 
responsibility for maintenance of the 
clinical quality measure. In general, it is 
the role of the clinical quality measure 
owner, developer, or maintainer/ 
steward to make basic changes to a 
clinical quality measure in terms of the 
numerator, denominator, and 
exclusions. We proposed that the 
clinical quality measures selected for 
the 2011 and 2012 payment year be 
supplemented by our technical 
specifications for EHR submission. We 
proposed to post the complete clinical 
quality measures specifications 
including technical specifications to our 
Web site and solicited comments on our 
approach. 
We received various comments as to 
our proposed considerations for 
selection of clinical quality measures for 
submission by EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs. 
Comment: One commenter said that 
there needs to be longer than nine 
months for the look back for capturing 
clinical quality measures data. Several 
commenters indicated that baseline 
measurements that have used the 
clinical quality measure in the past have 
not been performed. Commenters also 
recommended the linkage of clinical 
decision support to clinical quality 
measures to strengthen quality 
improvement efforts. A commenter 
supported our inclusion of measures 
that address both quality and resource 
use efficiency. Another commenter 
indicated support for the clinical quality 
measures as represented in the proposed 
rule. 
Response: The look back for capturing 
clinical quality measures is the period 
of time for which data would be 
considered as applying to the measure 
calculation. The look back period for a 
clinical quality measure and the method 
of documentation of prior information is 
defined by the clinical quality measure 
specification. The clinical quality 
measures require reporting and not 
achievement on particular performance 
thresholds. We agree with the 
commenters regarding the benefits of 
linking clinical decision support tools to 
the clinical quality measures, and 
anticipate that as EHR technology 
evolves, many of the clinical quality 
measures will be supported by clinical 
decision support tools. We also agree 
with the benefits of efficiency measures 
and we expect that in future program 
years the scope and variety of measures 
that address these factors will expand. 
Comment: Commenters requested a 
definition for ‘‘Eligible Provider and 
Non-Qualifying Eligible Provider’’ with 
respect to the provider’s ability to meet 
meaningful use if there are no 
appropriate clinical quality measures to 
report, the application of financial 
penalties beginning in 2015, and the 
handling of exclusions. Another 
commenter stressed the need for 
detailed information regarding what is 
included and excluded in the numerator 
and denominator for each measure so as 
to ensure that certified EHR 
technology’s programmed analytics 
capture all patients who meet the 
relevant criteria and to ensure that 
clinical quality measures are properly 
evaluated. Others indicated that 
reporting measures electronically will 
reduce administrative reporting costs. 
Other commenters supported the ability 
to report ‘‘N/A’’ for clinical quality 
measures where an insufficient 
denominator exists. Other commenters 
urged that CMS not include any clinical 
quality measures in Stage 1 of 
Meaningful Use because they believe 
Stage 1 should focus on the initial 
implementation of certified EHR 
systems and its use for patient care, and 
that EPs must gain experience with their 
certified EHR technology before 
attesting to the accuracy and 
completeness of numerators, 
denominators and quality calculations 
generated from these systems. 
Response: While some commenters 
recommended we not include any 
clinical quality measures in Stage 1 
(2011 and beginning in 2012), as 
previously described for Stage 1 EPs are 
required to attest to the clinical quality 
measures calculated results (numerator,

denominator, and exclusions) as 
automatically calculated by the certified 
EHR technology. Given that the 
statutory requirement for clinical 
quality measures is an element of 
meaningful use, we believe that 
providing this information on clinical 
quality measures is appropriate for 
Stage 1 (2011 and beginning in 2012). 
We would expect that the patient for 
whom a clinical quality measure does 
not apply will not be included in the 
denominator of the clinical quality 
measure. If not appropriate for a 
particular EP we would expect that 
either patients would not appear in the 
denominator of the measure (a zero 
value) or an exclusion would apply. 
Therefore reporting ‘‘N/A’’ is not 
necessary. Exclusion parameters—that 
is, information on what is included and 
excluded in the numerator and 
denominator for a clinical quality 
measure–are included in the measure 
specifications. We agree that reporting 
measures electronically will reduce 
administrative reporting costs, however 
as discussed in this final rule we will 
not require electronic submission of 
clinical quality measures until 2012. 
Also discussed earlier in this final rule, 
we believe collecting clinical quality 
measure data is an important part of 
meaningful use. 
Comment: A commenter indicated 
that CMS should take ownership of each 
of the EP clinical quality measures so 
that CMS can then adjudicate issues 
related to the clinical quality measures, 
instead of referring the EP to the 
measure owner. One commenter 
believes that EPs and their specialty 
societies should be the only owners of 
EP clinical quality measures. 
Response: We are the owner/ 
developer for certain clinical quality 
measures. More commonly, we use the 
clinical quality measures developed and 
owned by others, who are then 
responsible for the clinical quality 
measure specifications as endorsed by 
NQF. Numerous measures have been 
developed over the years by various 
organizations and CMS, and therefore 
we do not believe that specialty 
societies should be the only owners of 
EP clinical quality measures. The 
HITECH Act does not suggest or require 
that we should be the sole owner/ 
developer of clinical quality measures. 
Comment: A commenter questioned 
whether clinical quality measures 
would be updated during the bi-annual 
review process and how much lead time 
will be given. 
Response: The measures for Stage 1 
(2011 and beginning in 2012) of 
meaningful use are finalized in this final 
rule and will not change during that 
stage. Additionally, the electronic 
specifications, as posted on the CMS 
Web site at the time of publication of 
this final rule, are final. We intend to 
expand the clinical quality measures 
again for Stage 2 of meaningful use, 
which we anticipate will first be 
effective for the 2013 payment year. As 
required by the HITECH Act for the 
Medicare EHR incentive program, prior 
to selecting any new clinical quality 
measure(s) for Stage 2 of meaningful 
use, we will publish notice of the 
proposed measure(s) and request and 
consider public comments on the 
proposed measures. We note that the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program does 
not have the same statutory 
requirement. If future stages of 
meaningful use include clinical quality 
measures specific for Medicaid 
providers, we will consider a process to 
receive public input on such measures. 
Comment: One commenter suggested 
that only measures chosen for use in the 
pay-for-reporting program should be 
considered for implementation in the 
EHR incentive program. 
Response: We selected clinical quality 
measures that are broadly applicable for 
the 2011 and 2012 EHR incentive 
program. Many clinical quality 
measures used in other Medicare pay- 
for-reporting programs are not 
applicable to all Medicaid eligible 
providers, such as pediatricians, 
certified nurse-midwives, and children’s 
hospitals. 
Comment: Commenters suggested 
alignment between measures with 
vocabulary standards, in order to 
promote interoperability of clinical data. 
Stage 1 allows alternative vocabularies 
for problems, drugs, and procedures; 
and measures should only be included 
if alternative specifications using all 
Stage 1 vocabularies are provided. 
Commenters recommended 
incorporating HL7, LOINC, SNOMED, 
ICD–9, and ICD–10 for data exchange. 
Response: Standards for certified 
EHRs, including vocabulary standards, 
are included in ONC’s final rule (found 
elsewhere in this issue of the Federal 
Register). 
Comment: Commenter recommended 
that in the beginning stages of 
implementation of the EHR incentive 
programs, CMS should base its reporting 
initiatives on existing industry models 
to prevent delays, consumer mistrust, 
and potential legal issues. 
Response: We have conducted 
extensive reviews of industry standards, 
employed the comments of industry 
experts and solicited public comments 
on all proposed processes. 
Comment: Many commenters are 
concerned that there will not be 
adequate time to communicate and 
implement the electronic specification 
for 2011 clinical quality measure 
requirements. Additionally, one 
commenter expressed concern that the 
additional clinical quality measures 
required for 2011 reporting will not be 
posted by CMS in time for careful 
review and assessment, since currently 
there are only 15 measures 
electronically specified and posted. 
Commenters requested clinical quality 
measures to be posted with 
implementation guides for each quality 
reporting metric to ensure successful 
reporting. 
Response: We have limited the 
requirements for clinical quality 
measure reporting for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs to the 15 measures that were 
electronically specified and posted at 
the time of publishing the proposed 
rule. All measures specifications for 
clinical quality measures selected are 
final effective upon publication of the 
EHR incentive program final rule. 
d. Clinical Quality Measures for EPs 
For the 2011 and 2012 EHR reporting 
periods, based upon the considerations 
for selecting clinical quality measures 
discussed above, we proposed certain 
clinical quality measures that were 
identified in the proposed rule (see 75 
FR 1874–1889) for EPs. Tables 4 though 
19 of the proposed rule divided the 
clinical quality measures identified in 
Table 3 into core measures and specialty 
group measures (see 75 FR 1890 through 
1895). The concept of core measures 
and specialty group measures is 
discussed below. 
We also stated that some measures 
were in a higher state of readiness than 
others, and requested comment on each 
measure’s state of readiness for use in 
the EHR incentive programs. For those 
measures where electronic 
specifications did not, at the time of the 
proposed rule, exist, we solicited 
comment on how quickly electronic 
specifications could be developed, and 
the period of time required from final 
posting of the electronic specifications 
for final measures to ensure the effective 
implementation of the measures. We 
stated our intention to publish 
electronic specifications for the 
proposed clinical quality measures on 
the CMS Web site as soon as they 
become available from the measure 
developer(s). Electronic specifications 
may be developed concurrently with the 
development of measures themselves 
and potentially with the NQF 
endorsement processes. We stated that 
all of the proposed clinical quality 
measures included in Table 3 (see 75 FR 
1874–1889) meet one or more of the

criteria for the selection of clinical 
quality measures, discussed in the 
proposed rule. A large portion of these 
measures had been through notice and 
comment rulemaking for PQRI, and 
nearly all PQRI clinical quality 
measures are NQF endorsed. 
Additionally, they have broad 
applicability to the range of Medicare 
designated specialties, and the services 
provided by EPs who render services to 
Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries 
and many others. Further, nine of the 
proposed 90 clinical quality measures 
listed in Table 3 (see 75 FR 1874–1889) 
(PQRI numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 110, 111, 
112, and 113) had preliminary 
specifications for electronic submission 
that had already been developed for the 
purpose of testing the submission of 
clinical quality data extracted from an 
EHR for the PQRI program. The link to 
the preliminary electronic specifications 
for nine PQRI clinical quality measures 
was provided: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/ 
pqri. 
We stated that in terms of CMS and 
HHS healthcare quality priorities, 
clinical quality PQRI measures 
numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 address high 
priority chronic conditions, namely 
diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
heart disease. Clinical quality PQRI 
measures numbered 110, 111, 112, 113, 
114, 115, and 128 support prevention 
which is a high CMS and HHS priority. 
The PQRI clinical quality measure 
specifications for claims-based or 
registry-based submission of these 
clinical quality measures for the most 
current PQRI program year can be found 
on the PQRI section of the CMS Web 
site at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/
15_MeasuresCodes.asp#TopOfPage. A 
description of the clinical quality 
measure, including the clinical quality 
measure’s numerator and denominator, 
can be found in the PQRI clinical 
quality measure specifications. 
We pointed out that the PQRI clinical 
quality measures that were proposed 
largely align with the recommendations 
of the HIT Standards Committee. 
However, in addition to proposed 
clinical quality measures that are 
currently included in PQRI, we also 
proposed certain other clinical quality 
measures that we stated are of high 
importance to the overall population. 
Those clinical quality measures are 
Ischemic Vascular Disease (IVD): Use of 
Aspirin or another Antithrombotic; IVD: 
Complete Lipid Profile; IVD: Low 
Density Lipoprotein (LDL–C) Control, 
and Blood Pressure Management. 
Finally, we proposed an array of other 
measures which address important 
aspects of clinical quality. 
We stated our belief that the proposed 
clinical quality measures were broad 
enough to allow for reporting for EPs 
and addressed high priority conditions. 
We recognized the importance of 
integrating the measures into certified 
EHR technologies for calculation of 
measures results, and that not all 
measures would be feasible for 2011 and 
2012. We invited comment on the 
advisability of including the measures 
for payment years 2011 and 2012. 
Although we recognized that there are 
many other important clinical quality 
measures of health care provided by 
EPs, we anticipated expanding the set of 
clinical quality measures in future years 
and listed a number of clinical quality 
measures for future consideration in 
section II.A.3.g of the proposed rule 
preamble, on which we also invited 
comment. 
Comment: Many of the proposed 
clinical quality measures received 
favorable comments and support for 
inclusion in the final clinical quality 
measure set. A few examples of 
measures that were supported for 
inclusion were measures related to 
prevention and screening, and diabetes. 
It was stated by a commenter that the 
proposed rule includes some similar 
clinical quality measures. For example, 
the commenter indicated NQF 0059 and 
NQF 0575 both deal with hemoglobin 
A1c control. Others commented that 
some measures should be eliminated 
and not utilized in the final set of 
clinical quality measures for EPs. For 
example, a few commented that the 
following two measures should be 
eliminated, NQF 0052 and NQF 0513 
were intended to be implemented at the 
administrator site level using outpatient 
hospital claims and not at the 
individual practitioner level. A number 
of commenters stated that the 
specifications for certain clinical quality 
measures, for example, NQF 0022, NQF 
0031, NQF 0032, NQF 0033, NQF 0034, 
and NQF 0061 were not consistent with 
current clinical practice guidelines. 
Another commenter requested 
clarification for the specifications for 
NQF 0013 because blood pressures are 
not routinely monitored for 2-month-old 
patients. Many commenters provided 
suggestions for other clinical quality 
measures not included in the proposed 
rule. 
Response: We appreciate all of the 
suggestions from the commenters. We 
are unable to add any clinical quality 
measures that were not identified in the 
proposed rule due to language in 
sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(i)(II) and 
1886(n)(3)(B)(i) of the Act requiring a 
period of public comment for any 
finalized measures. This requirement 
does not pertain to the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program; we expect to develop 
a process in the future to solicit public 
input on Medicaid-specific clinical 
quality measures for future stages of 
meaningful use, if needed. However, we 
will consider those additional clinical 
quality measures recommended by 
commenters for future inclusion in the 
clinical quality measure sets. 
In regard to suggested changes/ 
revisions and/or elimination of the 
proposed clinical quality measures, we 
considered these suggestions when 
finalizing clinical quality measures in 
this final rule. In regard to this, we 
considered these suggestions when 
evaluating the clinical quality measures 
for selection in this final rule. Of the 
clinical quality measures in the 
proposed rule that we are not finalizing, 
we removed the measures that do not 
have electronic specifications by the 
date of display of this final rule. 
Additionally, some of the proposed 
clinical quality measures were 
recommended for deletion or 
modification, and therefore were 
recommended to not be used in the final 
rule; this is delineated in other 
comments and responses in this final 
rule. Further, we are only finalizing 
clinical quality measures that are 
electronically specified the date of 
display of the final rule. The electronic 
specifications included in the final set 
of clinical quality measures for EPs are 
posted to the CMS Web site at: http:// 
www.cms.gov/QualityMeasures/03_
ElectronicSpecifications.asp#
TopOfPage. 
Comment: Numerous commenters 
were concerned about the burden 
(economic and other) of reporting on the 
large number of clinical quality 
measures and the overall quality 
reporting burden this will add to EPs. 
Some commenters stated that the use of 
numerators and denominators for some 
measures will require manual 
calculation on the part of the EPs since 
there are no automated reports that can 
capture all of the information that must 
be tabulated. One commenter stated that 
there are insufficient resources to 
calculate the denominators of the 
required measures. Other commenters 
suggested using the PQRI requirements 
of reporting only three measures, and 
others suggested reporting on 
significantly smaller number of 
measures. 
Response: In response to the many 
comments received regarding the undue 
burden associated with reporting on a 
large number of clinical quality 
measures, or measures that involve a 
manual process, we have finalized only 
those clinical quality measures that can

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
be automatically calculated by a 
certified EHR technology. We further 
limited the measures to those for which 
electronic specifications are currently 
available, which we posted as final by 
the date of display of this final rule. 
This limitation significantly reduces the 
number of measures EPs are required to 
report in 2011 and 2012, thus reducing 
the EPs’ reporting burden as well as 
addressing commenters’ concerns about 
readiness. Although for 2011, Medicare 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs will 
still need to manually report (attest) to 
the results automatically calculated by 
their certified EHR technology, we 
believe that with the reduction in the 
number of measures that the burden is 
reasonable. Additionally, this provides 
for the reporting of clinical quality 
measures beyond simply the core 
clinical quality measures that EPs 
identify as suitable to report. 
Table 5, below, shows the proposed 
clinical quality measures for submission 
by Medicare and Medicaid EPs for the 
2011 and 2012 payment year as stated 
in the proposed rule (see 75 FR 1874– 
1889) for EPs, but that are not being 
finalized. Table 5 conveys the NQF 
measure number and PQRI 
implementation number (that is, the 
number used in the PQRI program to 
identify the measure as implemented in 
PQRI (for the 2010 PQRI measures list 
see https://www.cms.gov/PQRI/
Downloads/2010_
PQRI_MeasuresList_111309.pdf)), 
clinical quality measure title and 
description, and clinical quality 
measure steward and contact 
information. The measures listed below 
in Table 5 do not have electronic 
specifications finished before the date of 
display of this final rule, thus we have 
eliminated these measures for this final 
rule and will consider the addition of 
these measures in future rulemaking. 
Also several measures listed below were 
only concepts at the time of publication 
of the proposed rule (that is, 
Hysterectomy rates, Appropriate 
antibiotic use for ear infections, Statin 
after Myocardial Infarction, 30 day 
Readmission Rate, 30 Readmission Rate 
following deliveries, and Use of CT 
Scans). These concept measures were 
not developed or electronically 
specified clinical quality measures, nor 
NQF endorsed; and there was not 
adequate time to consider these 
concepts for development for this final 
rule. Therefore, the concepts listed 
below will be considered in future 
rulemaking. Lastly, NQF 0026 has since 
been retired since publication of the 
proposed rule.

BILLING CODE 4120–01–C 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested that CMS implement feedback 
reports early in the process that 
document whether EPs are successfully 
participating in the PQRI Program, the 
EHR incentive program, and the e- 
prescribing program, and that the report 
communicate whether the information 
received by CMS for these programs was 
successfully submitted and received. 
Response: As the PQRI and e- 
prescribing programs are beyond the 
scope of this rule, we do not address 
suggestions that we implement feedback 
reports related to these programs. The 
criteria to qualify for the EHR incentive 
payments are based on results 
automatically calculated by EPs’ 
certified EHR technology, as attested by 
the EPs. As such, we believe that the EP 
will be able to determine whether they 
have reported the required clinical 
quality measures to CMS or the State, 
rendering it unnecessary that CMS or 
the State provide the EP with a feedback 
report. We expect the system through 
which EPs, must submit information 
would indicate successful receipt 
beginning the first year of Stage 1. 
Comment: A commenter indicated 
that the clinical quality measure that 
addresses tobacco use and the measure 
that addresses smoking status apply to 
different age groups, and stated that 
they should be consistent. A number of 
commenters recommended removing 
smoking status as an objective from 
meaningful use section of this final rule, 
and only including it in the clinical 
quality measures in order to avoid 
confusion. 
Response: We are in agreement that 
the meaningful use objective and the 
clinical quality measure address the 
same topic of smoking. The clinical 
quality measure requires measurement 
of a clinical action performed by the EP 
to address the negative consequences of 
smoking, whereas the meaningful use 
objective seeks to make sure smokers are 
identified. Additionally, the age for 
recording smoking status for meaningful 
use is 13 years and older, and the 
population addressed by the clinical 
quality measure is 18 years and older, 
thus they are different with respect to 
intent of the objective/measure and the 
age population. For the clinical quality 
measure, we are keeping the age range 
at 18 years and older because the 
measure is currently NQF endorsed 
with these specifications. We will 
consider merging these in the future to 
reconcile the age range. 
Comment: Some commenters stated 
that reporting of ambulatory quality 
measures should remain voluntary for 
EPs, based on the view that many 
process measures do not correlate with 
outcomes and are not evidence based. A 
process measure focuses on a process 
which leads to a certain outcome, 
meaning that a scientific basis exists for 
believing that the process, when 
executed well, will increase the 
probability of achieving a desired 
outcome. A commenter stated that EPs 
serving needy patients, minorities, and 
populations with lower socioeconomic 
levels will experience lower 
performance on many clinical quality 
measures, and therefore will be deterred 
from participating in the EHR incentive 
program. 
Response: The EHR incentive program 
is voluntary. Similar to other Medicare 
quality measure reporting programs, EPs 
are not required to satisfy minimum 
clinical quality performance levels in 
order to qualify for the EHR payment 
incentive, but rather merely report on 
their ambulatory quality measure 
results. Thus, as currently structured, 
we do not believe the requirement that 
EPs report clinical quality measures 
would deter EPs who serve minority 
patients or patients of lower 
socioeconomic status or otherwise 
disadvantaged from participating in the 
program. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the basic requirement that EPs submit 
results for clinical quality measures.

This requirement applies to both the 
2011 and 2012 reporting periods (and 
will potentially continue to apply, until 
CMS issues a subsequent final rule that 
supplants this final rule). We are 
limiting the clinical quality measures to 
those for which electronic specifications 
are available (posted by CMS on the 
Web site at the time of display of this 
final rule.) These measures are listed in 
Table 6 of this final rule for EPs. They 
constitute the clinical quality measures 
‘‘specified by CMS’’ for the purposes of 
the ONC final rule (found elsewhere in 
this issue of the Federal Register) and 
are the measures that certified EHRs are 
required to be able to calculate. Of 
these, nine EP measures have 
preliminary electronic specifications for 
which we provided links for in the 
proposed rule. The remaining 35 
clinical quality measures for EPs were 
electronically specified more recently 
and posted on the CMS Web site by the 
date of display of this final rule. We are 
finalizing only those measures for 
which there are available electronic 
specifications as of the date of display 
of this final rule. Although we are not 
finalizing all of 90 proposed clinical 
quality measures that were proposed for 
EPs in Table 3 (see 75 FR 1874–1889) 
of the proposed rule, because of lack of 
electronic specifications, our intent is to 
include all of them in our proposed 
Stage 2 requirements, or to propose 
alternative measures following a 
transparent process that includes 
appropriate consultation with 
stakeholders and other interested 
parties. In addition, we plan to add new 
measures to fill gaps where measures 
were not previously proposed, such as 
in behavior and mental health (e.g., 
depression and alcoholism). Certified 
EHR technology must be able to 
calculate each measure numerators, 
denominators and exclusions for each of 
the clinical quality measures finalized 
for the EHR incentive program. Table 6 
conveys the applicable NQF measure 
number and PQRI implementation 
number (that is, the number used in the 
PQRI program to identify the measure as 
implemented in PQRI (for the 2010 
PQRI measures list see https:// 
www.cms.gov/PQRI/Downloads/2010_
PQRI_MeasuresList_111309.pdf)), title, 
description, the owner/steward, and a 
link to existing electronic specifications. 
The NQF number is an identifying 
number that is associated with the NQF 
endorsed measure number. All of the 
clinical quality measures in Table 6 are 
NQF endorsed and have broad 
applicability to the range of Medicare 
designated specialties, and the services 
provided by EPs who render services to 
Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries 
and many others. In terms of CMS and 
HHS healthcare quality priorities, 
clinical quality PQRI measures 
numbered 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 address high 
priority chronic conditions, namely 
diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
heart disease. Clinical quality PQRI 
measures numbered 66, 110, 111, 112, 
113, 114, 115, and 128 support 
screening and prevention all of which is 
a high CMS and HHS priority.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
e. Clinical Quality Measures Reporting 
Criteria for EPs 
For the 2011 and 2012 EHR reporting 
periods, to satisfy the requirements for 
reporting on clinical quality measures 
for Medicare under section 
1848(o)(2)(A)(i) and (iii) of the Act and 
for Medicaid under section 1903(t)(6)(C) 
of the Act, we proposed to require that 
each EP submit information on two 
measure groups: a core measures group 
(Table 4 of the proposed rule see 75 FR 
1890), and the subset of clinical 
measures most appropriate given the 
EP’s specialty (Tables 5 through 19 
specialty group measures see 75 FR 
1891 through 1895). For the core 
measure group, we stated our belief that 
the clinical quality measures were 
sufficiently general in application and 
of such importance to population 
health; we would require that all EPs 
treating Medicare and Medicaid patients 
in the ambulatory setting report on all 
of the core measures as applicable for 
their patients. 
We proposed that with the inclusion 
of measures applicable to targeting 
children and adolescents and the wide 
applicability of the measures like Blood 
Pressure Management, we believed the 
proposed core set of clinical quality 
measures and specialty measures was 
broad enough to enable reporting by all 
EPs. However, we encouraged 
commenters to identify the EPs in 
question and propose specific remedies 
if the public believed that other EPs 
would not have sufficient patients in the 
denominator of these core measures. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested clarification about the core 
measures group. Many comments were 
received regarding the inclusion of a 
core measure set for EPs. Some 
commenters favored the inclusion of 
one or more core measures (for example, 
preventive care) and others indicated 
core measures were essential for 
improving the quality of care. 
Conversely, numerous commenters 
suggested eliminating the core measure 
set for EPs. The primary reason offered 
by commenters for excluding core 
measures was that these clinical quality 
measures were outside their scope of 
practice and/or not relevant to their 
specific patient population. A 
commenter requested that the core set of 
clinical quality measures be better 
defined and/or increased for each 
reporting period. Many commenters 
indicated the clinical quality measures 
included in the core measure set are not 
appropriate to all EPs and specialists 
(for example, EPs that do not have direct 
physical access to the patients such as 
teleradioloists, EPs that do not routinely 
report blood pressure in patients with 
diagnosed hypertension, such as 
dermatologists) and they would not be 
able to report on these clinical quality 
measures. Many commenters supported 
reporting exclusions. A commenter 
recommended the use of PQRI 128/NQF 
0421 Preventive Care and Screening: 
BMI Screening and Follow-up as a core 
clinical quality measure. Other 
commenters indicated these clinical 
quality measures were important for 
improving care and the core measure set 
should be expanded. 
Response: After considering the 
comments, we agree there may be 
circumstances such that the core 
clinical quality measures are not 
applicable for specific patient 
populations and/or a specific EP’s scope 
of practice. In such circumstances we 
anticipate that the patients will not 
appear in the denominator at all or will 
be excluded. We have defined the core 
measure set for EPs in Table 7 of this 
final rule, and these core measures will 
be required for Stage 1. We expanded 
the core measures set to include three 
alternate measures, as well as added 
PQRI 128/NQF0421 as a required core 
measure, based on commenters 
feedback. Although we require all EPs to 
report the core measures, there is no 
requirement that the EP have any 
particular number of patients in the 
denominator, which could be zero as 
calculated by the EHR. Therefore we 
have changed the reporting criteria to 
require EPs to report on all three core 
measures (as shown in Table 7, below), 
and three additional clinical quality 
measures selected from Table 6 (other 
than the core or alternate core measures 
listed in Table 6). The clinical quality 
measures included in this final rule 
reflect a subset of measures that were 
included in the proposed rule (see 75 
FR 1874 through 1889). The clinical 
quality measures included in Table 6 of 
this final rule were selected from the 
Tables included in the proposed rule, 
based on having electronic 
specifications fully developed by the 
date of display of this final rule. 
Comment: Many commenters 
indicated that NQF 0022 Drugs to be 
avoided in the elderly is an 
inappropriate clinical quality measure 
and should be removed. The rationale 
given for removal is that the numerator 
(at least one prescription for any drug to 
be avoided in the elderly in the 
measurement year or at least two 
different drugs to be avoided in the 
elderly in the measurement year) tends 
to be very small. Others considered 
poly-pharmacy a more significant 
problem in the elderly than avoidance 
of specific drugs. A number of 
commenters indicated this clinical 
quality measure should include a list of 
the drugs to be avoided. 
Response: We agree with the concerns 
expressed by the commenters and have 
removed the measure NQF 0022. 
Additionally, electronic specifications 
are not available for this measure by the 
date of display of this final rule making 
this measure impractical to use for Stage 
1. We will consider this measure in 
future rulemaking. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the requirement that all EPs must 
submit calculated results for three core 
measures using the certified EHR 
technology. However, we are finalizing 
only two of the clinical quality 
measures that were proposed as ‘‘core 
measures’’ in the proposed rule. The 
other core measures presented in Table 
6 of this final rule were selected because 
they have broad applicability, support 
prevention, were recommended by 
commenters, and have electronic 
specifications by the date of display of 
this final rule. Insofar as a measure does 
not apply to patients treated by the EP, 
this will be reflected in the calculation 
of the clinical quality measure either by 
the patient not being included in the 
denominator for the measure or the 
patient being excluded. Therefore, it is 
not necessary for CMS to delineate for 
a particular specialty which measures 
may or not apply. We note that to 
qualify as a meaningful EHR user, EPs 
need only report the required clinical 
quality measures; they need not satisfy 
a minimum value for any of the 
numerator, denominator, or exclusions 
fields for clinical quality measures. The 
value for any or all of those fields, as 
reported to CMS or the States, may be 
zero if these are the results as displayed 
by the certified EHR technology. Thus, 
the clinical quality measure requirement 
for 2011 and beginning in 2012 is a 
reporting requirement and not a 
requirement to meet any particular 
performance standard for the clinical 
quality measure, or to in all cases have 
patients that fall within the 
denominator of the measure. 
The three core measures that EPs will 
be required to report are: [NQF 0013: 
Hypertension: Blood Pressure 
Management; NQF 0028: Preventative 
Care and Screening Measure Pair: a. 
Tobacco Use Assessment b. Tobacco 
Cessation Intervention; and NQF0421/ 
PQRI 128: Adult Weight Screening and 
Follow-up]. Insofar as the denominator 
for one or more of the core measures is 
zero, EPs will be required to report 
results for up to three alternate core 
measures [NQF 0041/PQRI 110: 
Preventative Care and Screening:

Influenza Immunization for Patients ≥50

Assessment and Counseling for 
Children and Adolescents; and NQF 
0038: Childhood Immunization Status]. 
We believe this final set of core clinical 
quality measures provides EPs a greater 
opportunity for successful reporting. 
The EP will not be excluded from 
reporting any core or alternate clinical 
quality measure because the measure 
does not apply to the EPs scope of 
practice or patient population. The 
expectation is that the EHR will 
automatically report on each core 
clinical quality measure, and when one 
or more of the core measures has a 
denominator of zero then the alternate 
core measure(s) will be reported. If all 
six of the clinical quality measures in 
Table 7 have zeros for the denominators 
(this would imply that the EPs patient 
population is not addressed by these 
measures), then the EP is still required 
to report on three additional clinical 
measures of their choosing from Table 6 
in this final rule. In regard to the three 
additional clinical quality measures, if 
the EP reports zero values, then for the 
remaining clinical quality measures in 
Table 6 (other than the core and 
alternate core measures) the EP will 
have to attest that all of the other 
clinical quality measures calculated by 
the certified EHR technology have a 
value of zero in the denominator, if the 
EP is to be exempt from reporting any 
of the additional clinical quality 
measures (other than the core and 
alternate core measures) in Table 6. 
Thus, EPs are not penalized in the Stage 
1 reporting years as long as they have 
adopted a certified EHR and that EHR 
calculates and the EP submits the 
required information on the required 
clinical quality measures, and other 
meaningful use requirements as defined 
in this final rule in section II.A.2.d.1 of 
this final rule. 
Table 7, below, shows the core 
measure groups for all EPs for Medicare 
and Medicaid to report. 
We proposed that EPs were to submit 
calculated results on at least one of the 
sets listed in Tables 5 and 19 as 
specialty groups (see 75 FR 1891–1895). 
The specialty groups were Cardiology, 
Pulmonary Diseases, Endocrinology, 
Oncology, Proceduralist/Surgery, 
Primary Care Physicians, Pediatrics, 
Obstetrics and Gynecology, Neurology, 
Psychiatry, Ophthalmology, Podiatry, 
Radiology, Gastroenterology, and 
Nephrology. 
We recognized that clinical quality 
measures as specified by measures 
developers and as endorsed by the NQF 
were not specific to particular 
specialties. Rather, the denominator of 
clinical quality measures and the 
applicability of a measure is determined 
by the patient population to whom the 
measure applies and the services 
rendered by the particular EP. 
Nevertheless, we grouped the 
proposed measures according to the 
types of patients commonly treated and 
services rendered by EPs of various 
specialties. We did this for purposes 
similar to measures groups used in PQRI 
which, however, are based on clinical 
conditions, rather than specialty types. 
We proposed that the general purpose of 
each specialty measures grouping was to 
have standardized sets of measures, all 
of which must be reported by the EP for 
the self-selected specialty measures 
groups in order to meet the reporting 
requirements. We expected to narrow 
down each set to a required subset of 
three-five measures based on the 
availability of electronic measure 
specifications and comments received. 
We also proposed to require for 2011 
and 2012 that EPs would select a 
specialty measures group, on which to 
report on all applicable cases for each of 
the measures in the specialty group. We 
also proposed that the same specialty 
measures group selected for the first 
payment year would be required for 
reporting for the second payment year. 
We invited comment on whether there 
were EPs who believed no specialty 
group would apply to them. In 
accordance with public comments, we 
noted that we would specify in the final 
rule which EP specialties would be 
exempt from selecting and reporting on 
a specialty measures group. As stated, 
we proposed, EPs that are so-designated 
would be required to attest, to CMS or 
the States, to the inapplicability of any 
of the specialty groups and would not

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
be required to report information on 
clinical quality measures from a 
specialty group for 2011 or 2012, though 
the EP would still be required to report 
information on all of the clinical quality 
measures listed in the proposed core 
measure set (see 75 FR 1890). 
Comment: Several commenters asked 
if certain specialties, such as 
chiropractors, audiologists, allergist and 
immunology, otolaryngologists, etc., 
could be exempt from having to report 
all specific clinical quality specialty 
measures. Many of these EPs indicated 
the clinical quality measures included 
in Table 3 were not relevant to their 
specific practice and/or patient 
population. Other commenters 
requested that specialty groups be 
created for specialties not included in 
the proposed rule measure groups, (for 
example, chiropractors, dentists, 
dermatologists, infectious disease, 
pediatric oncology, neurosurgery, 
interventional radiology, plastic & 
reconstructive surgery, physical 
therapists, occupational therapists, eye 
care specialists, family planning, 
genetics, ear/nose/throat, and 
nutritionists providers, etc.). Other 
commenters indicated that specialty 
clinical quality measures were specific 
to a subset of patients, but were not 
broadly applicable to their specialty for 
treating other conditions within their 
specialty area. Other commenters asked 
that CMS reconsider allowing EPs to 
attest only and be exempt from 
reporting if no applicable clinical 
quality measures specialty group exists 
for them. Another commenter indicated 
support of specific measure sets for 
different clinical specialties. Many 
commenters supported the elimination 
of specialty groups altogether as a 
mandatory set and instead supported 
the reporting of a fixed number of 
relevant clinically quality measures 
regardless of the specialty group. A 
commenter asked for a definition of 
‘‘specialist’’ which is not included in the 
proposed rule. Several commenters 
expressed concern about the large 
number of clinical quality measures in 
certain measure groups versus other 
measure groups (for example, the 
primary care, pediatric and ob/gyn 
measure groups) as well as the 
applicability of clinical quality 
measures assigned to primary care EPs 
when they do not manage conditions 
that are typically referred to a specialist 
for example, ischemic vascular disease. 
A commenter requested clarification 
and suggestions on how to select a 
clinical quality measure group. Several 
commenters wanted clarification on the 
proposed EP Specialty Measures Tables 
(see 75 FR 1874), and whether the EPs 
are accountable for only the clinical 
quality measures for their specialty. One 
comment indicated agreement with 
CMS regarding requiring EPs to report 
on the same specialty measure groups 
for 2011 and 2012 and another 
commenter indicated that CMS should 
not delay reporting of clinical quality 
measures as early adopters of EHRs will 
be ready to report. A few commenters 
suggested adding NQF 0033 Chlamydia 
screening in women to all other 
appropriate specialty clinical quality 
measure groups. A commenter indicated 
that PQRI #112, 113, and NQF 0032 
should be removed from the oncology 
clinical quality specialty measure group 
as oncologists do not perform routine 
cancer screenings. 
Response: We are appreciative of the 
detail provided by commenters to the 
potential inapplicability of the proposed 
specialty measures groups to various 
practitioner types or to the 
inapplicability of certain measures 
within groups to the specialties 
designated. Our primary purpose, 
similar to the core measures, was to 
encourage a certain consistency in 
reporting of clinical quality measures by 
EPs. However, after consideration of the 
comments we do not believe that the 
proposed specialty measures groups are 
sufficient to have a robust set of 
specialty measures groups. Further, 
given the lack of electronic 
specifications or final development of 
many of these measures, requiring 
specialty measures groups becomes 
even more impractical. We expect that 
electronic specifications will be 
developed for measures which would 
allow for a broadly applicable set of 
specialty measures groups in the future. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we removed the 
requirement for EPs to report on 
specialty measures groups as proposed. 
We intend to reintroduce the proposed 
rule’s specialty group reporting 
requirement in Stage 2 with at least as 
many clinical quality measures by 
specialty as we proposed for Stage 1 in 
the proposed rule. We expect to use a 
transparent process for clinical quality 
measure development that includes 
appropriate consultation with specialty 
groups and other interested parties, and 
we expect that electronic specifications 
will be developed for all of the measures 
that we originally proposed for Stage 1 
or alternative related measures, which 
would allow for a broadly applicable set 
of specialty measures groups and 
promote consistency in reporting of 
clinical quality measures by EPs. Also, 
in consideration of public comments 
received, we are finalizing the 
requirement (in addition to the core 
measure requirement) that EPs must 
report on three measures to be selected 
by the EP from the set of 38 measures 
as shown in Table 6, above. As stated 
previously, in regard to the three 
additional clinical quality measures, if 
the EP reports zero values, then for the 
remaining clinical quality measures in 
Table 6 (other than the core and 
alternate core measures) the EP will 
have to attest that all of the other 
clinical quality measures calculated by 
the certified EHR technology have a 
value of zero in the denominator. In 
sum, EPs must report on six total 
measures, three core measures 
(substituting alternate core measures 
where necessary) and three additional 
measures (other than the core and 
alternate core measures) selected from 
Table 6. 
We also proposed that although we do 
not require clinical quality measure 
reporting electronically until 2012, we 
would require clinical quality reporting 
through attestation in the 2011 payment 
year. We solicited comment on whether 
it may be more appropriate to defer 
some or all clinical quality reporting 
until the 2012 payment year. If reporting 
on some but not all measures in 2011 
was feasible, we solicited comment on 
which key measures should be chosen 
for 2011 and which should be deferred 
until 2012 and why. We discuss 
comments received regarding the 
reporting method for clinical quality 
measures in section II.A.3.h. of this final 
rule. 
f. Clinical Quality Measures for 
Electronic Submission by Eligible 
Hospitals and CAHs 
Our proposed rule would have 
required eligible hospitals and CAHs to 
report summary data to CMS on the set 
of clinical quality measures identified in 
Table 20 and 21 of the proposed rule 
(see 75 FR 1896–1899), with eligible 
hospitals attesting to the measures in 
2011 and electronically submitting these 
measures to CMS using certified EHR 
technology beginning in 2012. For 
hospitals eligible for only the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program, we proposed 
that reporting would be to the States. In 
the proposed rule, for eligible hospitals 
under both programs, we proposed that 
they would have to also report on the 
clinical quality measures identified in 
Table 21 of the proposed rule to meet 
the requirements for the reporting of 
clinical quality measures for the 
Medicaid program incentive (see 75 FR 
1896 through 1900). Tables 20 and 21 of 
the proposed rule (see 75 FR 1896 
through 1900) conveyed the clinical 
quality measure’s title, number, owner/

developer and contact information, and 
a link to existing electronic 
specifications where applicable. 
We included in the proposed hospital 
measures set several clinical quality 
measures which have undergone 
development of electronic 
specifications. These clinical quality 
measures have been developed for 
future RHQDAPU consideration. The 
electronic specifications were 
developed through an interagency 
agreement between CMS and ONC to 
develop interoperable standards for EHR 
electronic submission of the Emergency 
Department Throughput, Stroke, and 
Venous Thromboembolism clinical 
quality measures on Table 20 of the 
proposed rule (see 75 FR 1896 through 
1899). We also proposed to test the 
submission of these clinical quality 
measures in Medicare (see 75 FR 
43893). The specifications for the 
RHQDAPU clinical quality measures for 
eligible hospitals and CAHs that are 
being used for testing EHR-based 
submission of these clinical quality 
measures can be found at http:// 
www.hitsp.org/ConstructSet_
Details.aspx?&PrefixAlpha=5&
PrefixNumeric=906 (A description of 
the clinical quality measure, including 
the clinical quality measure’s numerator 
and denominator, can be found here as 
well.) Other measures we proposed 
derived from the RHQDAPU program or 
were measures we considered important 
for measuring or preventing adverse 
outcomes. In addition to risk 
standardized readmission clinical 
quality measures, we proposed that non- 
risk-adjusted readmission rates also be 
reported. For the proposed rule, we also 
considered HIT Standards Committee 
recommendations, including the 
Committee’s recommendation to 
include a measure on Atrial Fibrillation 
Receiving Anticoagulation Therapy 
which was included on Table 20 of the 
proposed rule Our proposed rule noted 
that we did not propose one measure 
recommended by the HIT Standards 
Committee: Surgery patients who 
received Venous Thromboembolism 
prophylaxis within 24 hours period to 
surgery to 24 hours after surgery end 
time. We noted that the measure is a 
current clinical quality measure 
collected in the RHQDAPU program 
through chart abstraction for all 
applicable patients (SCIP–VTE–2), and 
that the VTE–2 clinical quality measure 
in Table 20 of the proposed rule (see 75 
FR 1896 through 1899) was a parallel 
clinical quality measure to SCIP–VTE– 
2. SCIP–VTE–2 includes surgical and 
non-surgical patients, and can be more 
easily implemented for the EHR 
incentive program because electronic 
specifications had been completed. We 
added SCIP–VTE–2 for future 
consideration. 
Comment: Many commenters 
recommended reducing the number of 
eligible hospital clinical quality 
measures and indicated that such a large 
number of measures would pose a 
significant financial and administrative 
burden on hospitals. Commenters 
suggested a variety of solutions which 
include: Eliminating duplication 
between clinical quality measures and 
meaningful use objectives and 
associated measures, reducing the 
number of clinical quality measures for 
reporting and allowing organizations to 
select a limited number of clinical 
quality measures on which they would 
like to report. 
We received comments supporting 
many of the measures in the proposed 
rule including Venous 
Thromboembolism, Emergency 
Department, Stroke, RHQDAPU, and 
measures that are evidence-based that 
could improve the quality of care. 
Others recommended additional clinical 
quality measures, changes to the 
specifications for clinical quality 
measures or the elimination of certain 
clinical quality measures such as risk 
adjusted re-admission measures or 
measures not applicable to CAHs. Many 
commenters supported the process 
through which the electronic 
specifications were developed for the 
Emergency Department Throughput, 
Stroke and Venous Thromboembolism 
measures while also pointing out the 
length of time necessary to adequately 
develop electronic specifications and 
test the clinical quality measures. Many 
commented that the remaining measures 
had not been electronically specified or 
had otherwise not completed 
development and would not be ready in 
time for the 2011–2012 implementation. 
Others stated their concerns about 
duplicate reporting systems and the 
belief that the HITECH Act reporting 
requirements should be based on the 
RHQDAPU program, similar to the 
conceptual framework of hospitals 
value-based purchasing plan. Others 
pointed to measures that are already 
currently reported in RHQDAPU and 
the statutory provision that clinical 
quality measure reporting required for 
the HITECH Act should seek to avoid 
duplicative and redundant reporting of 
measures reported under RHQDAPU. 
Response: We are appreciative of the 
comments supporting many of the 
clinical quality measure sets and the 
process utilized for electronically 
specifying the Emergency Department 
Throughput, Stroke, and Venous 
Thromboembolism sets. As we have 
discussed for the EP measures, we agree 
that we should limit the required 
clinical quality measures to those 
measures for where there are electronic 
specifications as of the date of display 
of this final rule. This will allow EHR 
vendors sufficient time to ensure that 
certified EHR technology will be able to 
electronically calculate the measures. 
Therefore, we are not finalizing those 
clinical quality measures that either 
have not been fully developed, are 
currently only specified for claims 
based calculation, or for which there are 
not fully developed electronic 
specifications as of the date of display 
of this final rule. Accordingly, we are 
only finalizing the 15 measures listed in 
Table 10 of this final rule. We note that 
none of these measures are duplicate 
measures which are currently required 
for reporting in the RHQDAPU program. 
We therefore do not need to address the 
issue of duplicate or redundant 
reporting. We will consider adding, 
changing, developing, and eliminating 
duplicative clinical quality measures 
and meaningful use objectives/ 
associated measures in future 
rulemaking. 
Table 8, shows the proposed clinical 
quality measures for submission by 
Medicare and Medicaid Eligible 
Hospitals for the 2011 and 2012 
payment year as stated in the proposed 
rule (see 75 FR 1896–1899) for EPs, but 
that are not being finalized. Table 9, 
shows the proposed alternative 
Medicaid clinical quality measures for 
Medicaid eligible hospitals in the 
proposed rule (see 75 FR 1899–1900). 
Tables 8 and 9 convey the NQF measure 
number, clinical quality measure title 
and description, and clinical quality 
measure steward and contact 
information. The measures listed below 
in Tables 8 and 9 do not have electronic 
specifications finished before the date of 
display of this final rule, thus we have 
eliminated these measures for this final 
rule and will consider the addition of 
these measures in future rulemaking. 
Also several measures listed below were 
only concepts at the time of publication 
of the proposed rule (that is, Hospital 
Specific 30 day Rate following AMI 
admission, Hospital Specific 30 day 
Rate following Heart Failure admission, 
Hospital Specific 30 day Rate following 
Pneumonia admission, and All-Cause 
Readmission Index). These concept 
measures were not developed or 
electronically specified clinical quality 
measures, nor NQF endorsed; and there 
was not adequate time to consider these 
concepts for development for this final 
rule. Therefore, the concepts listed

Comment: Commenters stated that 
current health information technology is 
not capable of electronically collecting 
or reporting on clinical quality 
measures. Commenters also stated we 
should not require reporting on clinical 
quality measures that cannot easily be 
derived from EHRs. Other commenters 
believed the timeline was unreasonable 
to obtain the functionality required in 
the EHR system to report on these 
clinical quality measures and were 
concerned that there were no 
vocabulary standards. 
Response: We agree with the 
comment that eligible hospitals should 
only be required to submit information 
that can be automatically obtained from 
certified EHR technology. As we 
discussed elsewhere, ONC’s final rule 
(found elsewhere in this issue of the 
Federal Register) requires that certified 
EHR technology must be able to 
calculate clinical quality measures 
specified by us in this final rule. 
Standards for certified EHRs, including 
vocabulary standards, are included in 
ONC’s final rule (found elsewhere in 
this issue of the Federal Register). 
Comment: Commenters recommended 
that CMS conduct a pilot test of the 
NQF endorsed HITSP electronic 
specifications of measures in the 
proposed rule for Stage 1 prior to their 
adoption. Commenters requested CMS 
publish results of the pilot and use this 
information to inform the setting of 
Stage 2 and 3 objectives and clinical 
quality measures. Commenters also 
requested allowing adequate time for 
implementation after the pilot test 
before such measures are considered for 
certification, and 24 months before 
requiring them for meaningful use. One 
commenter stated that the Emergency 
Department Throughput, Stroke, and 
Venous Thromboembolism have not yet 
been thoroughly tested for automated 
reporting and data element capture. 
Additional commenters recommended 
that the measures selected for the 
eligible hospitals incentive program 
should be comprehensively 
standardized and tested in the field to 
ensure that they are thoroughly 
specified, clinically valid when the data 
are collected through the eligible 
hospitals system, feasible to collect, and 
are regularly updated and maintained 
with a well established process. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that it is important to allow 
adequate time for pilot testing and 
implementation before clinical quality 
measures should be considered for 
certification, as well as requiring these 
measures for meaningful use. 
Emergency Department 1, Emergency 
Department 2, and Stroke 3, clinical 
quality measures for eligible hospitals 
and CAHs that are included in this final 
rule, were tested during the January 
2010 Connectathon and demonstrated at 
the HIMSS 2010 Interoperability 
Showcase. Additionally, as part of the 
process of certification of EHR 
technology it is expected that certifying 
bodies will test the ability of EHR 
technology to calculate the clinical 
quality measures finalized in this final 
rule. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, eligible hospitals 
and CAHs will be required to report on 
each of the 15 clinical quality measures, 
as shown in Table 10. Requiring eligible 
hospitals and CAHs to report on each of 
the 15 clinical quality measures in the 
EHR incentive program is consistent 
with the RHQDAPU program, which 
requires reporting on all applicable 
quality measures. Eligible hospitals and 
CAHs will report numerators, 
denominators, and exclusions, even if 
one or more values as displayed by their 
certified EHR is zero. We note that to 
qualify as a meaningful EHR user, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs need only 
report the required clinical quality 
measures; they need not satisfy a 
minimum value for any of the 
numerator, denominator, or exclusions 
fields for clinical quality measures. The 
value for any or all of those fields, as 
reported to CMS or the States, may be 
zero if these are the results as displayed 
by the certified EHR technology. Thus, 
the clinical quality measure requirement 
for 2011 and beginning with 2012 is a 
reporting requirement and not a 
requirement to meet any particular 
performance standard for the clinical 
quality measure, or to in all cases have 
patients that fall within the 
denominator of the measure. Further, 
the criteria to qualify for the EHR 
incentive payments are based on results 
automatically calculated by eligible 
hospitals or CAHs certified EHR 
technology, as attested by the eligible 
hospital or CAH. As such, we believe 
that the eligible hospitals or CAHs will 
be able to determine whether they have 
reported the required clinical quality 
measures to CMS or the State, rendering 
it unnecessary that CMS or the State 
provide the eligible hospital or CAH 
with a feedback report, which provides 
information to eligible hospitals and 
CAHs as to whether they have reported 
their required clinical quality measures. 
We expect successful receipt of 
Medicare eligible hospitals and CAHs’ 
information, beginning the first year of 
Stage 1. 
We are finalizing Table 10, which 
conveys the clinical quality measure’s 
title, number, owner/steward and 
contact information, and a link to 
existing electronic specifications.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
We proposed that to satisfy the 
requirements of reporting on clinical 
quality measures under sections 
1886(n)(3)(A)(iii) and 1903(t)(6)(C) of 
the Act for the 2011–2012 payment year, 
we would require eligible hospitals and 
CAHs to report on all EHR incentive 
clinical quality measures for which they 
have applicable cases, without regard to 
payer. We proposed that Medicare 
eligible hospitals and CAHs, who are 
also participating in the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program, will also be required 
to report on all Medicaid clinical quality 
measures for which the eligible hospital 
has applicable cases. We also proposed 
that to demonstrate an eligible hospital 
or CAH is a meaningful EHR user, the 
eligible hospital or CAH would be 
required to electronically submit 
information on each clinical quality 
measures for each patient to whom the 
clinical quality measure applies, 
regardless of payer, discharged from the 
hospital during the EHR reporting 
period and for whom the clinical quality 
measure is applicable. Although as 
proposed, we did not require clinical 
quality reporting electronically until 
2012, we would begin clinical quality 
reporting though attestation in the 2011 
payment year. We solicited comment on 
whether it may be more appropriate to 
defer some or all clinical quality 
reporting until the 2012 payment year. 
If reporting on some but not all 
measures in 2011 was feasible, we 
solicited comment on which key 
measures should be chosen for 2011 and 
which should be deferred until 2012 
and why. 
Comment: We received numerous 
comments strongly opposed to requiring 
the reporting of clinical quality 
measures by eligible hospitals prior to 
2013, although some comments favored 
the reporting in 2011 and 2012. 
Comments in favor pointed to the 
importance of quality measurement to 
achieving improvement in healthcare 
quality. Those opposed to the reporting 
of clinical quality measures in 2011 and 
2012 cited concerns as to the readiness 
of EHR technology for automated 
calculation and reporting of clinical 
quality measures as well as financial 
and administrative burden. Many 
commenters stated that measures should 
be fully automated and tested prior to 
implementation, and recommended the 
process for Emergency Department 
Throughput, Stroke, and Venous 
Thromboembolism measures where 
CMS developed the specifications and 
has in place a plan to test the 
submission of such measures for 
RHQDAPU. Commenters stated their 
expectation that the testing process 
would reveal important insights as to 
potential challenges of electronic 
submission. Numerous commenters 
opposed measures already in 
RHQDAPU and not able to be calculated 
by the EHR technology. Many 
commenters stated that electronic data 
submission should be developed 
through the RHQDAPU program rather 
than have a separate quality measure 
reporting program, such as the EHR 
incentive program. Further, commenters 
stated that RHQDAPU should provide 
the foundation for migration to 
electronic reporting. Numerous 
commenters were opposed to having a 
temporary data collection and reporting 
process through attestation that would 
need to be updated or replaced once 
CMS has the appropriate infrastructure 
in place. Many commenters stated that 
requiring hospitals to report summary 
data through attestation, without the 
ability for CMS to receive the summary 
data electronically, creates a dual 
reporting burden for measures currently 
in RHQDAPU. Many commenters stated 
concerns as to the timing of the 
certification process for EHRs since 
having a certified EHR is an essential 
element for quality incentives. 
Numerous commenters pointed out that 
only 15 of the proposed measures have 
electronic specifications currently 
available. 
Response: We are sensitive to and 
appreciate the many comments urging 
us not to require the submission of 
clinical quality measures, through 
attestation or electronic submission, 
prior to 2013, based on lack of readiness 
of many of the proposed measures, fully 
automating and testing prior to 
implementation, burden, and the 
potential duplication of quality 
measures reporting requirements under 
the RHQDAPU and the EHR incentive 
payment programs. Having carefully 
considered these comments, we have 
sought to address them while still 
retaining the important goal of 
beginning the process of using the 
capacity of EHRs to promote improved 
quality of care in hospitals by providing 
calculated results of clinical quality 
measures. In terms of readiness, we are 
limiting the clinical quality measures to 
those measures having existing 
electronic specifications as of the date of 
display of this final rule. Additionally, 
as recommended by commenters, we 
will only require hospitals to submit 
that information that can be 
automatically calculated by their 
certified EHR technology. Thus we will 
require no separate data collection by 
the hospital, but require submission 
solely of that information that can be 
generated automatically by the certified 
EHR technology; that is, we only adopt 
those clinical quality measures where 
the certified EHR technology can 
calculate the results. Further, we are not 
adopting any measures which are 
already being collected and submitted 
in the RHQDAPU program. Therefore, 
we are imposing no duplicate reporting 
requirement on hospitals who 
participate in RHQDAPU. Through 
future rulemaking we will seek to align 
the EHR incentive program with 
RHQDAPU. 
Comment: Some commenters stated 
that CMS contradicts itself, where the 
proposed rule states that Medicare 
eligible hospitals who are also 
participating in Medicaid EHR incentive 
program will need to report on all of the 
Medicaid clinical quality measures and 
where it says that Table 21 is an 
alternative set of clinical quality 
measures if the hospital does not have 
any patients in the denominators of the 
measures in Table 20. Many 
commenters requested clarification of 
the Medicare and Medicaid reporting. 
Response: We agree that the 
description of the eligible hospital and 
CAH reporting requirements was 
unclear. To clarify, our proposal was 
that if a hospital could submit 
information on clinical quality measures 
sufficient to meet the requirements for 
Medicare that would also be sufficient 
for Medicaid. However, hospitals for 
which the Medicare measures did not 
reflect their patient populations could 
satisfy the Medicaid requirements by 
reporting the alternate Medicaid clinical 
quality measures. Reporting the 
alternate Medicaid measures would 
only qualify for the Medicaid program 
and would not qualify eligible hospitals 
as to the Medicare incentive program. In 
this final rule, this clarification is moot, 
however, because we removed the 
alternate Medicaid list of clinical 
quality measures listed in Table 21 (see 
75 FR 1896 through 1900) of the 
proposed rule for eligible hospitals. This 
was based on the lack of electronic 
specifications for these measures 
available at the time of display of this 
final rule. Hospitals that report 
information on all 15 of the clinical 
quality measures, as applicable to their 
patient population, will qualify for both 
the Medicare and the Medicaid 
submission requirements for clinical 
quality measures. We recognize that 
many of the measures in the Medicare 
list would likely not apply to certain 
hospitals, such as children’s hospitals. 
However, an eligible hospital would 
meet the clinical quality measure 
requirement by reporting values for the 
15 clinical quality measures, including,

values of zero for the denominator, if 
accurate. Some value is required for 
each of the 15 clinical quality measures 
for eligible hospitals and CAHs. 
Therefore, for example, a children’s 
hospital would enter zero for the 
denominator for any of the 15 measures 
for which they do not have any patients 
as described in the measure. 
After consideration of public 
comments received, we are finalizing 15 
clinical quality measures that eligible 
hospitals and CAHs will be required to 
report for Stage 1 (2011 and beginning 
2012), as applicable to their patient 
population. Those 15 clinical quality 
measures for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs can be found in Table 10 of this 
final rule. 
g. Potential Measures for EPs, Eligible 
Hospitals, and CAHs in Stage 2 and 
Subsequent Years 
We stated our expectation that the 
number of clinical quality measures for 
which EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs 
would be able to electronically submit 
information would rapidly expand in 
2013 and beyond. 
We plan to consider measures from 
the 2010 PQRI program. These clinical 
quality measures can be found at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/PQRI/05_
StatuteRegulations
ProgramInstructions.asp. For future 
considerations of clinical quality 
measures for Stage 2 of meaningful use 
and beyond for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs, we also plan to consider other 
clinical quality measures from the 
RHQDAPU program which are 
identified in the FY 2010 IPPS final rule 
(75 FR 43868–43882). We invited 
comments on inclusion of clinical 
quality measures for the 2013 and 
beyond for the HITECH Act Medicare 
and Medicaid incentive program. We 
note that as with the other meaningful 
use objectives and measures, in the 
event that we have not promulgated 
clinical quality measures for the 2013 
payment year, the measures for Stage 1 
(beginning in 2011) would continue in 
effect. 
For the Stage 2 of meaningful use, we 
indicated in the proposed rule that we 
are considering expanding the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program’s clinical quality 
measure set for EPs and eligible 
hospitals to include clinical quality 
measures that address the following 
clinical areas, to address quality of care 
for additional patient populations, and 
facilitate alignment with Medicaid and 
CHIP programs: 
• Additional pediatrics measures 
(such as completed growth charts, 
electronic prescriptions with weight- 
based dosing support and 
documentation of newborn screening). 
• Long-term care measures. 
• Additional obstetrics measures. 
• Dental care/oral health measures. 
• Additional behavioral/mental 
health and substance abuse measures. 
The above list does not constitute a 
comprehensive list of all clinical quality 
measures that may be considered. We 
stated that specific measures for Stage 2 
of meaningful use and beyond may be 
addressed by CMS in future notice and 
comment rulemaking. To assist us in 
identifying potential clinical quality 
measures for future consideration for 
Stage 2 of meaningful use and beyond, 
we solicited comments on the potential 
topics and/or clinical quality measures 
listed above as well as suggestions for 
additional clinical quality measure 
topics and/or specific clinical quality 
measures. 
The following is a summary of 
comments received regarding the 
request for public comment on potential 
measures for EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs for Stage 2 of meaningful use and 
subsequent stages, and our responses. 
Comment: A commenter suggested 
using newly adopted NQF Level 3 
measures that incorporate common 
electronic administrative and clinical 
data that represent a better measure of 
the patient’s condition. A commenter 
suggested adding long term care and 
post acute care measures in the next 
stage of meaningful use. A few 
commenters suggested future clinical 
quality measures be coordinated with 
Healthy People 2020. Another comment 
regarding measures included a request 
for medication measures that evaluate 
provider intervention. Other 
commenters indicated CMS should 
provide a more structured process for 
the adoption of clinical quality 
measures such that specialty EPs would 
have greater input into and ownership 
of the process. A commenter requested 
consideration that future clinical quality 
measures address both quality and 
resource use efficiency (for example 
potentially preventable Emergency 
Department visits and hospitalizations 
and inappropriate use of imaging MRI 
for acute low back pain). A commenter 
requested future clinical quality 
measures for the following areas: reduce 
hospital readmissions and to improve 
medication management, specifically 
safe and efficient management of heart 
disease, diabetes, asthma, mental health 
conditions and hospital procedures. A 
commenter requested clinical quality 
measures that will aid in increasing 
improved patient safety and reduce 
disparities. A commenter also 
recommended developing new clinical 
quality outcomes measures to address 
overuse and efficiency, care 
coordination, and patient safety. Some 
commenters requested the inclusion of 
HIV testing and reporting for preventive 
service quality measures. Some 
commenters stated that this would help 
to facilitate continued efforts to promote 
and implement the 2006 CDC Revised 
Recommendation on HIV testing, 
especially to non-HIV medical 
specialties. Some commenters 
recommended measure development in 
the areas of community mental health, 
home health, renal dialysis centers, long 
term care, post acute care, and nursing 
homes. A commenter recommended 
including 3 month treatment of 
pulmonary emboli (NQF 0593) and deep 
vein thrombosis (NQF 0434) for the next 
stage of meaningful use and beyond. A 
commenter requested including health 
disparity data in all clinical quality 
measure analyses. Some commenters 
also recommended future clinical 
quality measure development in the 
following areas: Diabetes, heart disease, 
asthma, disease screening, chronic 
disease management, patient safety, 
nursing sensitive measures, atrial 
fibrillation, and ethnic disparities. 
Commenters requested expanding 
pediatric measures to provide expanded 
focus on childhood diseases that require 
hospitalization such as asthma, 
developmental issues and weight-based 
medication dosage safety issues. 
Additional commenters requested 
measures for blood test for lead levels 
for children up to 1 year of age and 
between 1 and 2 years of age, co-morbid 
conditions and dental utilization. A 
commenter recommended that only one 
EP should be accountable for the quality 
intervention and clinical quality 
measure such as NQF 0323 Title: End 
Stage Renal Disease (ESRD): Plan of 
Care for Inadequate Hemodialysis in 
ESRD Patient. The commenter indicated 
that this type of measure could involve 
more than one provider, for example, 
nephrologist and a dialysis facility. 
Because provider clinical practices may 
vary, practice variations may 
independently influence patient 
outcomes. Some commenters suggested 
future development of measures foster 
greater use of the clinical information 
available in EHRs to improve clinical 
processes and evaluate patient outcomes 
and suggested use of outcomes measures 
instead of process measures. 
Furthermore, commenters support the 
inclusion of outcomes measures rather 
than process measures and composite 
versus individual measures. Several 
commenters indicated support for the 
preventive care measures included in

the proposed rule and suggested 
expanding the set of preventive care 
measures to include HIV and STD 
screening and eye care specialty 
measures. A commenter requested CMS 
provide information about their strategic 
plan for future Medicare clinical quality 
measurement selection, how they will 
improve care delivery, proposed stages 
of reporting, goals and metrics. 
Response: We are appreciative of the 
many suggestions and acknowledge the 
breadth of interest in certified EHR 
technology being the vehicle for clinical 
quality measures reporting. We expect 
to consider these suggestions for future 
measure selection in the Medicare and 
Medicaid EHR incentive payment 
programs. 
Comment: We received various 
comments pertaining to future clinical 
quality measures applicable principally 
to the Medicaid population. One 
commenter urged CMS to include 
clinical quality measures specific to 
newborn screening in Stage 1 of 
meaningful use for pediatric providers. 
Response: We agree that newborn 
screening, both as a clinical quality 
measure, and from a data standards 
perspective, is a prime candidate for 
inclusion in the Stage 2 definition of 
meaningful use. We affirm our proposed 
statement about our commitment to 
work with the measure development 
community to fill noted gaps. We are 
appreciative of the many suggestions. 
We expect to consider these suggestions 
for immunizations, prenatal screening, 
infectious disease, etc. in measure 
selection in future rulemaking. 
Comment: A commenter indicated 
CMS should make explicit the health 
goals and targets for the HITECH Act 
investments that are already implied by 
the proposed clinical measures. Making 
them explicit allows CMS to set national 
targets. 
Response: In general, the goal with 
respect to clinical quality measures is to 
improve healthcare quality as measured 
by the clinical quality measures. We 
believe that specific quantitative targets 
are impractical at this stage given lack 
of established base level notes and no 
prior clinical quality measure reporting 
via certified EHR technology. 
Comment: Several commenters asked 
how CMS plans to develop further 
measure specifications for clinical 
quality measures. Another commenter 
asked for an electronic source for ICD– 
9 and CPT codes defining the specific 
conditions or diagnoses or treatments in 
order to maintain an up-to-date 
capability. 
Response: For many clinical quality 
measures, clearly defined electronic 
specifications are not yet available. In 
general, CMS relies on the measures’ 
stewards to both develop measures and 
to provide the specifications. 
Nevertheless, we recognize that many 
existing measures, some of which are 
owned and maintained by us or its 
contractors, do not currently have 
electronic specifications. We are aware 
of work currently taking place to fill this 
gap. We expect to actively work in a 
collaborative way with measures 
developers and stewards to help assure 
the development of electronic 
specifications for clinical quality 
measures, but we also expect to engage 
a contractor to perform work developing 
electronic specifications which may or 
may not involve measure developers 
and stewards. As for CPT codes, these 
are copyrighted by and are available 
from the American Medical Association. 
The National Center for Health Statistics 
(NCHS) and CMS are the U.S. 
governmental agencies responsible for 
overseeing all changes and 
modifications to the ICD–9 codes. 
Comment: Some commenters 
suggested specific new clinical quality 
measures which are listed below in 
Table 11. Several commenters suggested 
new or revised clinical quality measures 
or the use of existing measures from 
other programs.

Response: Many of the proposed 
clinical quality measures are in the 
existing PQRI program or are NQF 
endorsed. Others are not. We are 
appreciative of these many specific 
suggestions and will retain the 
comments for future consideration. 
Prior to including measures in the 
Medicare EHR incentive payment 
program, as required by the HITECH 
Act, we will publish the measures in the 
Federal Register and provide an 
opportunity for public comment. We 
will examine all options for soliciting 
public comment on future Medicaid- 
specific clinical quality measures, as the 
Federal Register notice requirement 
does not apply to the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. 
Comment: Some commenters 
suggested the following new topics for 
clinical quality measure development 
for our program:

Response: We appreciate the 
suggested measure topics submitted by 
commenters for potential new clinical 
quality measures. Any future clinical 
quality measures developed will be in 
consideration of the clinical practices 
particular to EPs and eligible hospitals. 
We have captured these 
recommendations and will have them 
available for consideration in future 
years. 
h. Reporting Method for Clinical Quality 
Measures for 2011 and Beginning With 
the 2012 Payment Year 
(1) Reporting Method for 2011 Payment 
Year 
As we previously discussed, we 
proposed to use attestation as a means 
for EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs, for 
purposes of the Medicare incentive 
program, to demonstrate the meaningful 
use requirement for the calculation and 
submission of clinical quality measure 
results to CMS. 
Specifically, for 2011, we proposed to 
require that Medicare EPs and hospitals 
attest to the use of certified EHR 
technology to capture the data elements 
and calculate the results for the 
applicable clinical quality measures. 
State Medicaid HIT Plans submitted to 
CMS will address how States will verify 
use of certified EHR technology to 
capture and calculate clinical quality 
measures by Medicaid EPs and eligible 
hospitals. 
Further, we proposed to require that 
Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs attest to the accuracy and 
completeness of the numerators, 
denominators, and exclusions submitted 
for each of the applicable measures, and 
report the results to CMS for all 
applicable patients. We expect that 
States will follow a similar strategy as 
Medicare for the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. 
We proposed that attestation will 
utilize the same system for other 
attestation for meaningful use 
objectives, and proposed we would 
require for Medicare EPs that they attest 
to the following: 
• The information submitted with 
respect to clinical quality measures was 
generated as output of an identified 
certified EHR technology. 
• The information submitted is 
accurate to the best of the knowledge 
and belief of the EP. 
• The information submitted includes 
information on all patients to whom the 
clinical quality measure applies. 
• The NPI and TIN of the EP 
submitting the information, and the 
specialty group of clinical quality 
measures that are being submitted. 
• For an EP who is exempt from 
reporting each of the core measures, an 
attestation that one or more of the core 
measures do not apply to the scope of 
practice of the EP. 
• For an EP who is exempt from 
reporting on a specialty group, an 
attestation that none of the specialty 
groups applies to the scope of practice 
of the EP. 
• For an EP who does report on a 
specialty group, but is exempt from 
reporting on each of the clinical quality 
measures in the group, an attestation 
that the clinical quality measures not 
reported do not apply to any patients 
treated by the EP. 
• The numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for each clinical quality 
measure result reported, providing 
separate information for each clinical 
quality measure including the 
numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for all patients irrespective of 
third party payer or lack thereof; for 
Medicare FFS patients; for Medicare 
Advantage patients; and for Medicaid 
patients. 
• The beginning and end dates for 
which the numerators, denominators, 
and exclusions apply. 
Again, State Medicaid Agencies will 
determine the required elements for 
provider attestations for clinical quality 
measure reporting, subject to CMS prior 
approval via the State Medicaid HIT 
Plan. 
For eligible hospitals, we proposed to 
require that they attest to the following: 
• The information submitted with 
respect to clinical quality measures was 
generated as output from an identified 
certified EHR technology. 
• The information submitted to the 
knowledge and belief of the official 
submitting on behalf of the eligible 
hospital. 
• The information submitted includes 
information on all patients to whom the 
measure applies. 
• The identifying information for the 
eligible hospital. 
• For eligible hospitals that do not 
report one or more measures an 
attestation that the clinical quality 
measures not reported do not apply to 
any patients treated by the eligible 
hospital during the reporting period. 
• The numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for each clinical quality 
measure result reported, providing 
separate information for each clinical 
quality measure including the 
numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for all patients irrespective of 
third party payer or lack thereof; for 
Medicare FFS patients; for Medicare 
Advantage patients; and for Medicaid 
patients. 
• The beginning and end dates for 
which the numerators, denominators, 
and exclusions apply. 
The following is a summary of 
comments received regarding the 
proposed reporting method for clinical 
quality measures for the 2011 payment 
year, and our responses. 
Comment: The majority of 
commenters were against requiring 
attestation for 2011, rather than 
suggesting modification of the specific 
attestation requirements. Others 
commented that reporting should not be 
delayed to realize quality improvements

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
and better health outcomes for patients 
as soon as possible. Many commenters 
suggested deferral of clinical quality 
measures submission until CMS can 
electronically accept data. Commenters 
indicated that this is consistent with 
allowing delayed reporting by Medicaid 
providers until 2012 or beyond. A 
number of commenters suggested that 
attestation should be confined to 
attesting that the EP’s had reviewed or 
selected relevant clinical quality 
measures. 
Response: While we received many 
comments to delay attestation past 2011, 
we are finalizing our proposed 
requirement for EPs and eligible 
hospitals to attest to the numerators, 
denominators, and exclusions in their 
first payment year for the required 
clinical quality measures as described in 
section II.A.3.d through f of this final 
rule. Medicaid providers do not have 
‘‘delayed reporting of clinical quality 
measures.’’ The statute and this final 
rule allow Medicaid providers the 
option of receiving the EHR Incentive 
Payment for having adopted, 
implemented or upgraded to certified 
EHR technology, in lieu of meeting the 
meaningful use bar in their first 
participation year. We expect that most 
Medicaid providers would choose to 
adopt, implement or upgrade to certified 
EHR technology, rather than 
demonstrating they are meaningful EHR 
users in their first participation year. 
Comment: Some commenters also 
suggested EPs should only have to attest 
that the EP is entering the required data 
elements for clinical quality measure 
reporting where those fields exist in the 
certified EHR technology and provide 
feedback to the vendor where structured 
data fields are not available. Other 
commenters indicated the burden of 
adding numerous new data elements is 
high and labor intensive. 
Response: We considered the 
suggestion of only requiring attestation 
of documentation of clinical encounters. 
While we agree that this could be 
considered ‘‘information on clinical 
quality measures,’’ however, we do not 
believe that such information is needed 
when including the submission of 
information on clinical quality 
measures, which is a required element 
of meaningful use. We also believe that 
submission of such information would 
be of limited value. We believe that by 
limiting the clinical quality measure 
submission requirement to those results 
calculated by certified EHR technology, 
we have limited the potential burden. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are requiring 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs to 
attest to the numerator, denominator, 
and exclusions for the payment year 
2011 at § 495.8. We are finalizing the 
following requirements for EPs in this 
final rule for reporting clinical quality 
measures: 
• The information submitted with 
respect to clinical quality measures was 
generated as output of an identified 
certified electronic health record. 
• The information submitted is 
accurate to the best of the knowledge 
and belief of the EP. 
• The information submitted includes 
information on all patients to whom the 
clinical quality measure applies for all 
patients included in the certified EHR 
technology. 
• The NPI and TIN of the EP 
submitting the information at § 495.10. 
• The numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for each clinical quality 
measure result reported, providing 
separate information for each clinical 
quality measure including the 
numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for all applicable patients 
contained in the certified EHR 
technology irrespective of third party 
payer or lack thereof. 
• The beginning and end dates for 
which the numerators, denominators, 
and exclusions apply (the Medicare 
EHR reporting period in payment year 1 
is 90 days as stated at § 495.4, and for 
payment year 2 is the beginning and end 
date of the reporting period as stated at 
§ 495.4. For Medicaid providers, as 
there is no EHR reporting period for 
adopting, implementing or upgrading 
for their first payment year, it is in their 
second payment year/first year of 
demonstrating meaningful use that they 
have a 90-day EHR reporting period. 
Therefore, it is their 2nd year of 
demonstrating meaningful use that has 
a 12 month EHR reporting period. For 
eligible hospitals and CAHs, we are 
finalizing the following requirements in 
this final rule: 
• The information submitted with 
respect to clinical quality measures was 
generated as output from an identified 
certified EHR technology. 
• The information submitted is 
accurate to the best of the knowledge 
and belief of the official submitting on 
behalf of the eligible hospital or CAHs. 
• The information submitted includes 
information on all patients to whom the 
measure applies for all patients 
included in the certified EHR 
technology. 
• The identifying information for the 
eligible hospital and CAH at § 495.10. 
• The numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for each clinical quality 
measure result reported, providing 
separate information for each clinical 
quality measure including the 
numerators, denominators, and 
exclusions for all applicable patients 
contained in the certified EHR 
technology irrespective of third party 
payer or lack thereof. 
• The beginning and end dates for 
which the numerators, denominators, 
and exclusions apply (the Medicare 
EHR reporting period in payment year 1 
is 90 days as stated at § 495.4, and for 
payment year 2 is the beginning and end 
date of the reporting period as stated at 
§ 495.4. For Medicaid providers, as 
there is no EHR reporting period for 
adopting, implementing or upgrading 
for their first payment year, it is in their 
second payment year/first year of 
demonstrating meaningful use that they 
have a 90-day EHR reporting period. 
Therefore, it is their 2nd year of 
demonstrating meaningful use that has 
a 12 month EHR reporting period. 
States must implement the same 
meaningful use requirements, including 
clinical quality measures, with the 
exceptions described in section II.A. of 
this final rule. Therefore, Medicaid EPs 
and eligible hospitals must submit the 
same required information described 
above for clinical quality measures. 
States will propose in their State 
Medicaid HIT Plans how they will 
accept provider attestations in the first 
year they implement their Medicaid 
EHR incentive program, and how they 
will accept electronic reporting of 
clinical quality measures from 
providers’ certified EHR technology in 
their second and subsequent 
implementation years. 
(2) Reporting Method Beginning in 2012 
In our proposed rule, we proposed 
that for the 2012 payment year, the 
reporting method for clinical quality 
measures would be the electronic 
submission to CMS of summary 
information, (that is, information that is 
not personally identifiable) on the 
clinical quality measures selected by the 
Secretary using certified EHR 
technology. For Medicaid, we proposed 
that EPs and hospitals eligible only for 
the Medicaid EHR incentive program 
must report their clinical quality 
measures data to States. We proposed 
that States would propose to CMS how 
they plan to accept and validate 
Medicaid providers’ clinical quality 
measures data in their State Medicaid 
HIT Plans, subject to CMS review and 
approval. 
As we did for payment year 2011, for 
2012, we also proposed reporting on all 
cases to which a clinical quality 
measures applies in order to accurately 
assess the quality of care rendered by 
the particular EP, eligible hospital, or 
CAH generally. Otherwise it would only

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
be possible to evaluate the care being 
rendered for a portion of patients and 
lessen the ability to improve quality 
generally. We solicited comments on the 
impact of requiring the submission of 
clinical quality measures data on all 
patients, not just Medicare and 
Medicaid beneficiaries. 
The following is a summary of 
comments received regarding the 
proposed reporting method beginning in 
2012 in regard to the collection of 
aggregate level data on all patients. 
Comment: Several commenters noted 
that it appears that EPs are supposed to 
submit clinical quality measures 
electronically to the States in 2012. The 
commenters noted that several States 
have aging Medicaid Management 
Information Systems that may not be 
capable of accepting this data/ 
information. The commenters requested 
clarification about whether CMS expects 
the States to utilize and report this data 
immediately. 
Response: To clarify, States may 
propose to CMS in their State Medicaid 
HIT Plans (See Section 495.332) the 
means by which they want to receive 
providers’ clinical quality measures, 
starting with States’ second 
implementation year of their Medicaid 
EHR incentive program. States are not 
obliged to receive this data using their 
MMIS but can consider other options 
such as but not limited to: An external 
data warehouse, registries or health 
information exchanges that include data 
repositories. 
Comment: A commenter asked that 
we state the authority which provides 
us the ability to require EPs and 
hospitals to report on non-Medicare and 
Medicaid patients. 
Response: Sections 1848(o)(A)(2)(iii) 
and 1886(n)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act broadly 
state that as a condition of 
demonstrating meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology, an EP, CAH or 
eligible hospital must ‘‘submit 
information’’ for the EHR reporting 
period on the clinical quality or other 
measures selected by the Secretary ‘‘in a 
form and manner specified by the 
Secretary.’’ Likewise, section 1903(t)(6) 
of the Act states that demonstrating 
meaningful use may include clinical 
quality reporting to the States, and may 
be based upon the methodologies that 
are used in sections 1848(o) and 
1886(n). This language does not limit us 
to collecting only that information 
pertaining to Medicare and Medicaid 
beneficiaries. Therefore, we believe that 
we have the authority to collect 
summarized clinical quality measures 
selected by the Secretary, with respect 
to all patients to whom the clinical 
quality measure applies, treated by the 
EP, eligible hospital, or CAH. We 
believe that the quality of care of our EP, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs, as well as 
the ability to demonstrate the 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology, is best reflected by the care 
rendered to all patients, not just 
Medicare or Medicaid beneficiaries. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended patient level data for 
clinical quality measure reporting while 
others supported CMS’ requirement to 
submit summary level data for EPs and 
hospitals. There were several 
commenters that indicated support for 
reporting clinical quality measure data 
on all patients rather than just on 
Medicare and Medicaid patients. 
Another commenter stated that CMS 
should not require hospitals to submit 
patient level data and that the data 
should be at the aggregated level for all 
payment years. Another commenter 
stated that it is well proven in other 
disciplines that aggregated clinical data 
on quality measures can drive 
improvements in outcomes. Another 
commenter recommended patient level 
data that would be useful to State health 
programs and link information to 
managed care organizations. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that stated that reporting 
clinical quality measure data for all 
patients provides a more comprehensive 
measure of quality. We acknowledge 
that there are potential advantages to 
patient level data in measuring quality 
such as those stated by the commenter. 
However, for Stage 1 we have elected to 
require aggregate level data since the 
EHR standards as adopted by ONC’s 
final rule (found elsewhere in this issue 
of the Federal Register) do not provide 
standards for the submission of patient 
level data. 
Comment: The commenter requested 
that CMS should have a process in place 
to support end-users with on-going help 
desk support. 
Response: We agree with the 
suggestion for the implementation of a 
help desk to respond to questions 
related to the various CMS related 
questions after implementation of the 
proposed rule. Information about how 
we will provide assistance to providers 
will occur outside this final rule. 
Comment: A few commenters asked 
for clarification regarding the Stage 1 
audit process to ensure accuracy for the 
reporting of clinical quality measures 
(for example, numerator, denominator, 
and exception data). 
Response: EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs are required for 2011 to attest to 
results as automatically calculated by 
certified EHR technology. Beginning 
with 2012, such information will be 
submitted electronically with respect to 
these requirements; we expect our audit 
strategy would be based on verifying 
that the results submitted accord with 
how they were calculated by the 
certified EHR technology. 
Comment: We received comments 
requesting that CMS require that eligible 
providers report their clinical quality 
measures data to not only States and 
CMS, but also to Regional Health 
Improvement Collaboratives, where 
such programs exist. The commenters 
believed that this represents an 
alternative means for data submission 
rather than attestation and would allow 
States and CMS to test this alternative 
in 2011 or 2012. A commenter requested 
that CMS interpret the statutory 
requirement (Sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(iii) 
and 1886(n)(3)(B)(iii)) to avoid 
redundant or duplicative reporting of 
quality measures to include not just 
other CMS reporting efforts but also to 
avoid duplicative and redundant 
reporting with State and/or regional 
quality measurement and reporting 
efforts. They therefore requested that for 
Medicaid, CMS require EPs and 
hospitals report their clinical quality 
measures to not only States/CMS but 
also to Regional Health Improvement 
Collaboratives, where such programs 
exist. 
Response: Clinical quality measures 
need to be reported to CMS for the 
Medicare program. For 2011, we intend 
to provide a web based tool for 
attestation. Beginning with 2012 for 
Medicare, we will provide one or more 
alternative options for electronic 
submission which may include 
intermediaries. For Medicaid, 
information will go to the States as 
directed by the States. We believe it 
would go well beyond the purview of 
this provision to require additional 
reporting other than to CMS or the 
States. To clarify the issue raised by the 
commenter, sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(iii) 
and 1886(n)(3)(B)(iii) are tied to the 
Secretary and Federally-required quality 
measures reporting programs. However, 
CMS agrees that State and regional 
redundancies could be very 
problematic. We therefore clarify our 
proposed policy. States must include in 
their State Medicaid HIT Plans an 
environmental scan of existing HIT and 
quality measure reporting activities 
related to Medicaid. We expect States to 
include details in their SMHP about 
how these other on-going efforts can be 
leveraged and supported under 
HITECH; and how HITECH will not 
result in duplicative and/or burdensome 
reporting requirements on the same 
providers or organizations.

 44433 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
In the proposed rule, we proposed 
that Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs would be required to report 
the required clinical quality measures 
information electronically using 
certified EHR technology via one of 
three methods. The primary method we 
proposed would require the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH to log into a CMS- 
designated portal. Once the EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH has logged into the 
portal, they would be required to 
submit, through an upload process, data 
payload based on specified structures, 
such as Clinical Data Architecture 
(CDA), and accompanying templates 
produced as output from their certified 
EHR technology. 
As an alternative to this data 
submission method, we proposed to 
permit Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs to submit the required 
clinical quality measures data using 
certified EHR technology through 
Health Information Exchange (HIE)/ 
Health Information Organization (HIO). 
This alternative data submission 
method would be dependent on the 
Secretary’s ability to collect data 
through a HIE/HIO network and would 
require the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
who chooses to submit data via an HIE/ 
HIO network to be a participating 
member of the HIE/HIO network. 
Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs would be required to submit their 
data payload based on specified 
structures or profiles, such as Clinical 
Data Architecture (CDA), and 
accompanying templates. The EPs, 
eligible hospitals, or CAHs data payload 
would be an output from their 
respective certified EHR technologies, in 
the form and manner specified from 
their HIE/HIO adopted architecture into 
the CMS HIE/HIO adopted architecture. 
As another potential alternative, we 
proposed to accept submission through 
registries dependent upon the 
development of the necessary capacity 
and infrastructure to do so using 
certified EHRs. 
We stated in the proposed rule that 
we intended to post the technical 
requirements for portal submission and 
the alternative HIE/HIO submission, the 
HIE/HIO participating member 
definition, and other specifications for 
submission on our Web site for 
Medicare EPs on or before July 1, 2011 
and for Medicare eligible hospitals and 
CAHs on or before April 1, 2011 for EHR 
adoption and incorporation and to 
accommodate EHR vendors. 
The following is a summary of 
comments received regarding the 
proposed reporting method for clinical 
quality measures beginning with the 
2012 payment year, and our responses. 
Comment: A commenter 
recommended that CMS test a range of 
reporting options for clinical quality 
measures to establish uniform and 
reliable rates of data transmission. 
Several commenters supported the three 
data submission methodologies listed in 
the proposed rule to allow flexibility in 
the quality reporting mechanisms. Many 
commenters requested reporting via 
registries. 
Response: We agree with the 
desirability of considering the three 
transmission methodologies listed in the 
proposed rule. The submission through 
a portal is the only mechanism that is 
feasible and practical for 2012 electronic 
clinical quality measure submission. We 
plan to test HIE/HIO and registry 
submission for future possible 
implementation through HITECH. 
Comment: A commenter requested 
clarification as to when CMS would no 
longer accept data for 2012 for Medicare 
EPs. 
Response: The specific technical 
mechanism for attestation and 
electronic submission will be posted on 
the CMS Web site, and through various 
educational products in development. 
We anticipate that the last date for 
attestation or electronic submission will 
be two-three months after the close of 
the applicable EHR reporting period for 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs 
respectively. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that CMS continue programs 
that incentivize advanced patient care 
for providers who are not eligible for the 
EHR incentive program and/or who do 
not become meaningful users of 
certified EHR technology. 
Response: CMS clarifies, based upon 
the comments, that our efforts to avoid 
duplicative quality reporting 
requirements do not necessarily mean 
the discontinuation of other quality 
reporting programs. CMS and State 
Medicaid agencies support several 
quality reporting programs that are 
legislatively mandated or approach 
quality measurement in ways that are 
not exclusively tied to HIT, or that, are 
voluntary and/or address emerging or 
developing quality measure focus areas. 
We are committed to determining where 
the EHR incentive program’s quality 
measure reporting can support other 
quality objectives, where it cannot and 
how to best align our overall quality 
measurement efforts across programs. 
Comment: Many commenters 
requested deferring quality measure 
reporting until 2012 and/or 2013, at 
which time all measures will be 
electronically specified and tested. 
Commenters believed that this was 
especially important for new clinical 
quality measures such as Emergency 
Department Throughput and Stroke, and 
recommended gradually phasing in or 
gradually increasing the number of 
reportable measures and measure sets 
over time to allow for sufficient testing 
and harmonization between programs. 
Some commenters suggested that for 
Stage 1, eligible hospitals should be 
required to report only on the 15 
measures that have been electronically 
specified and those that are appropriate 
for that organization. One commenter 
requested clinical quality measure 
reporting should be optional. Also, 
commenters requested for 2011 and 
2012 that hospitals continue to report 
clinical quality measures through the 
current pay-for-reporting (RHQDAPU 
and HOP QDRP) programs or on clinical 
quality measures that coincide with 
HEDIS reporting measures including 
HOS and CAHPS, using the existing 
approaches, while quality measurement 
specialists and vendors create valid, 
reliable, and field-tested e-measures for 
deployment in the eligible hospitals for 
2013. Finally, commenters stated that 
the proposed timeline may negatively 
impact credibility of data produced and 
have potentially negative impact on 
patient safety. 
Response: With respect to comments 
received regarding the timeline for 
implementation of the EHR incentive 
program, we are only finalizing clinical 
quality measures that are electronically 
specified by the date of display of this 
final rule. For eligible hospitals and 
CAHs, we are finalizing 15 clinical 
quality measures as listed in Table 10 of 
this final rule that will be required to 
report for 2011 and 2012, as applicable 
to their patient population. Although we 
understand the suggestion that reporting 
through RHQDAPU should suffice for 
the HITECH Act, the difficulty is that 
HITECH specifically requires that EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs use 
‘‘certified EHR technology’’ in 
connection with the submission of 
clinical quality measures. Thus the 
HITECH Act introduces a requirement 
that at least some clinical quality 
measures be submitted in connection 
with the use of certified EHR 
technology, whereas RHQDAPU has no 
such requirement. We have limited the 
measures to those that have been 
electronically specified and that are able 
to be automatically calculated by the 
certified EHR technology. These results 
will be reported by EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs. We will seek to 
align the EHR incentive program and 
quality reporting programs in future 
rulemaking.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
clinical quality measures data beyond 
what a certified EHR can produce. 
Specifically, commenters stated that no 
clinical quality measures required for 
submission in Stage 1 should require a 
manual chart review. Some commenters 
also requested allowing submission of 
clinical quality measures through other 
EHRs that are not certified. 
Response: We have adopted the 
suggested approach for 2011 and 2012 
that limits the required information on 
clinical quality measures results to that 
which can be automatically calculated 
by the certified EHR technology. As to 
non-certified EHR technology, the 
HITECH Act incentive program 
specifically requires the meaningful use 
of certified EHR technology. 
Comment: Several commenters stated 
that currently the data required to be 
used in the calculation of clinical 
quality measures are obtained from EHR 
discrete fields, free text and paper 
records. Commenters recommended a 
uniform reporting structure. 
Commenters questioned if they would 
be submitting raw data, numerators and 
denominators only, if there will be an 
intermediary file that will allow manual 
edits to the file prior to submission, and 
if not will validity be based entirely on 
discrete electronic data. Commenters 
asked if sampling will be permitted or 
if hospitals will be required to report on 
entire populations. Commenters 
supported the value of reporting clinical 
quality measures for all patients, not 
just Medicare and Medicaid patients, in 
order to see the whole picture of the 
patient population which will enhance 
quality improvement. 
Response: As discussed elsewhere, 
the submission requirement is limited to 
calculated results of clinical quality 
measures from certified EHR 
technology, as specified in this final 
rule, and as is consistent with the ONC 
final rule (see 75 FR 2014) which 
requires certified EHR technology to be 
able to calculate clinical quality 
measures as specified by CMS. 
Comment: Several commenters 
suggested the clinical quality measures 
requiring medication administration 
data be delayed for reporting because 
they require advanced features of EHR 
systems with implementation of the 
features, in particular Electronic 
Medication Administration Record 
(eMAR). 
Response: The Department has 
adopted certification criteria for EHR 
Modules and Complete EHRs, as 
identified in the Health Information 
Technology: Initial Set of Standards, 
Implementation Specifications, and 
Certification Criteria for Electronic 
Health Record Technology; Interim 
Final Rule (75 FR 2014). It has also 
proposed temporary and permanent 
certification programs for testing and 
certifying health information technology 
in a March 10, 2010 proposed rule (75 
FR 11328). The certification of EHRs 
will assure functionality of the 
information system to obtain clinical 
quality data from the EHR. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, starting in payment 
year 2012, in addition to meeting 
requirements for measures on 
meaningful EHR use and other 
requirements, Medicare EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs will be required to 
electronically submit clinical quality 
measures results (numerators, 
denominators, exclusions) as calculated 
by certified EHR technology at § 495.8. 
Medicaid EPs will be required to do so 
in the State’s second implementation 
year for their Medicaid EHR incentive 
program. The clinical quality measures 
will be for all patients, regardless of 
payer, and will be for the period of the 
EHR reporting period. Medicare EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs will be 
required to report the required clinical 
quality measures information 
electronically using certified EHR 
technology via one of three methods. 
The primary method will require the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH to log into a 
CMS-designated portal. Once the EP, 
eligible hospital, or CAH has logged into 
the portal, they will be required to 
submit, through an upload process, data 
payload based on specified structures, 
such as Clinical Data Architecture 
(CDA), and accompanying templates 
produced as output from their certified 
EHR technology. 
As an alternative to this data 
submission method, contingent on 
feasibility, we will permit Medicare EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs to submit 
the required clinical quality measures 
data using certified EHR technology 
through a Health Information Exchange 
(HIE)/Health Information Organization 
(HIO). This alternative data submission 
method will be dependent on the 
Secretary’s ability to collect data 
through a HIE/HIO network and would 
require the EP, eligible hospital, or CAH 
who chooses to submit data via an HIE/ 
HIO network to be a participating 
member of the HIE/HIO network. 
Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs would be required to submit their 
data payload based on specified 
structures or profiles. The EPs, eligible 
hospitals, or CAHs data payload should 
be an output from their respective 
certified EHR technologies, in the form 
and manner specified from their HIE/ 
HIO adopted architecture into the CMS 
HIE/HIO adopted architecture. 
As another alternative, we will also 
accept submission through registries 
dependent upon the development of the 
necessary capacity and infrastructure to 
do so using certified EHRs. Finally, 
qualifying Medicare Advantage 
organizations for their eligible Medicare 
Advantage EPs, as well as, Medicare 
Advantage-affiliated eligible hospitals 
and CAHs will continue to submit 
HEDIS, HOS and CAHPS data instead of 
the clinical quality measures results 
under this final rule in section II.C.6. 
We will post the technical 
requirements for portal submission and 
the alternative HIE/HIO submission, the 
HIE/HIO participating member 
definition, and other specifications for 
submission on our Web site for 
Medicare EPs on or before July 1, 2011 
and for Medicare eligible hospitals and 
CAHs on or before April 1, 2011 for EHR 
adoption and to accommodate EHR 
vendors. 
State Medicaid Agencies must follow 
the same requirements for meaningful 
use, including clinical quality measures, 
for example, across all payers and for 
the entire EHR reporting period for EPs 
and eligible hospitals. We expect that 
States will be able to accept the 
electronic reporting of clinical quality 
measures by their second year of 
implementing the EHR incentive 
program. States will include in their 
State Medicaid HIT Plan a description 
of how Medicaid providers will be able 
to electronically report clinical quality 
measures, subject to CMS prior 
approval. 
i. Alternative Reporting Methods for 
Clinical Quality Measures 
We proposed several alternative 
reporting methods to create a dataset of 
provider-submitted summary data. One 
such alternative we proposed is the 
development of a distributed network of 
EHRs where health information is 
retained locally in individual EP, 
eligible hospital, and CAH EHRs and 
only summary reports are submitted to 
CMS. Another alternative we proposed 
is the creation of databases of patient- 
level EHR data stored at the state or 
regional level. 
The following is a summary of 
comments received regarding the 
proposed alternative reporting methods 
for clinical quality measures and our 
responses. 
Comment: A commenter recommends 
aggregate reporting necessary for 
clinical quality measures to be able to be 
completed in secondary systems such as 
data warehouses. 
Response: For Medicare, we require 
that the data source be from certified 
EHR technology. EPs, eligible hospitals

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
and CAHs may use intermediaries (data 
warehouses) to submit the EHR- 
generated clinical quality measure if 
available, assuming all requirements are 
met. States may seek CMS prior 
approval via their State Medicaid HIT 
Plans for how they expect Medicaid 
providers to report the required 
meaningful use data, including clinical 
quality measures. For example, States 
may propose that the data, while it 
originates in the providers’ certified 
EHR technology, may be reported using 
a health information exchange 
organization or registry as an 
intermediary. 
Comment: A few commenters 
communicated that the calculation and 
submission of quality measures may 
depend on the use of health information 
technology systems beyond those used 
by the EP such as data warehouses or 
registries that have to manipulate the 
data received. They indicated the final 
rule should not exclude the use of 
additional non-certified EHR technology 
to assist EPs in satisfying the quality 
reporting requirements provided the EP 
uses certified EHR technology to capture 
the data and to calculate the results. 
Response: Certified EHR technology 
will be required to calculate the clinical 
quality measure results for the CMS 
specified measures we finalize in this 
final rule and transmit under the PQRI 
Registry XML specification, as provided 
in the ONC final rule (found elsewhere 
in this issue of the Federal Register). 
Comment: Several commenters 
recommended inclusion of QRDA with 
PQRI XML for reporting, thus allowing 
vendors the ability to bypass PQRI XML 
if they plan to ultimately implement 
QRDA. There is also concern that 
switching to QRDA from XML will 
require duplicative investments. They 
recommended attestation for 2011 and 
2012 as well as allowing use of QRDA 
in 2012. 
Response: Electronic specifications 
will need to utilize standards that the 
certified EHR can support. ONC’s final 
rule (found elsewhere in this issue of 
the Federal Register) limits this to PQRI 
Registry XML specifications. There is no 
current requirement that a certified EHR 
be able to produce QRDA. 
j. Reporting Period for Reporting of 
Clinical Quality Measures 
Sections 1848(o)(A)(2)(iii) and 
1886(n)(3)(A)(iii) of the Act state that to 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology for an EHR reporting 
period, an EP, eligible hospital, and 
CAH must submit information ‘‘for such 
period’’ on the clinical quality measures 
and other measures selected by the 
Secretary. Therefore we proposed that 
the reporting period for the clinical 
quality measures selected by the 
Secretary be the EHR reporting period. 
Another alternative we proposed was 
a fixed reporting period of four quarterly 
reporting periods, or two six-month 
reporting periods. In terms of practice 
and precedent for other Medicare 
clinical quality measure reporting 
programs, all of these programs submit 
data to us at specific reporting intervals. 
The following is a summary of 
comments received regarding the 
proposed EHR reporting period for EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs. 
Comment: Some commenters asked 
for clarification on whether the EP must 
continuously report during the ‘‘entire 
payment year’’ or whether the reporting 
period for clinical quality measures 
covers a 12-month period. Other 
commenters questioned the timing of 
the requirements associated with the 
measures—whether the specifications 
for Stage 1 payment year 1 apply to EPs 
regardless of when the EPs become first 
eligible or whether the clinical quality 
measure specifications follow the 
calendar year. 
Response: The EP only needs to report 
clinical quality measures once a year, as 
described at § 495.4. For Medicare EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs, the EHR 
reporting period is 90 days for their first 
payment year. For Medicaid eligible 
providers, their first payment year in 
which they demonstrate meaningful use 
(which may be their second payment 
year, if they adopted, implemented or 
upgraded in their first payment year) 
also has a 90-day EHR reporting period. 
For Medicare EPs, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs, in their second payment year, the 
reporting period is 12 months. For 
Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals, in 
their second payment year of 
demonstrating meaningful use, they also 
have a 12-month EHR reporting period. 
Related to the timing of the 
requirements, the final clinical quality 
measure specifications for 2011 and 
2012 will be posted at the time of 
display of this final rule. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification of the process for 
reporting in the entire payment year. A 
commenter requested clarification 
regarding whether the EP must 
continuously report during the entire 
payment year or whether the reporting 
period for clinical quality measures 
covers an entire 12-month period. Some 
commenters pointed out that reporting 
capability may not be available every 
day of the year due to information 
system availability. 
Response: Technical requirements for 
electronic reporting will be posted on 
the CMS Web site prior to the reporting 
period. The reporting period refers to 
parameters of the data captured in the 
EHR or the services documented in the 
EHR, not the time when the submission 
of information regarding clinical quality 
measures is made. States will dictate for 
Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals the 
timing of submission of their clinical 
quality measures data via electronic 
reporting. Submission could be as 
infrequent as once a year after the close 
of the reporting period. The reporting 
period beyond 2011 and 2012 for 
clinical quality measures will be 
determined in future rulemaking. 
4. Demonstration of Meaningful Use 
Section 1848(o)(3)(C) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(a) of the HITECH 
Act, requires that as a condition of 
eligibility for the incentive payment, an 
EP must demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology (other than the 
reporting on clinical quality and other 
measures) as discussed in section II.A.3 
of this final rule in the manner specified 
by the Secretary, which may include the 
following: An attestation, the 
submission of claims with appropriate 
coding, a survey response, reporting of 
clinical quality or other measures, or 
other means. Similarly, section 
1886(n)(3)(c) of the Act, as added by 
section 4102(a) of the HITECH Act, 
requires that hospitals seeking the 
incentive payment demonstrate 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology in the manner specified by 
the Secretary. Section 1903(t)(6)(C)(i)(II) 
of the Act, as added by section 
4201(a)(2) under the HITECH Act, states 
that a Medicaid EP or eligible hospital 
must demonstrate meaningful use 
through a ‘‘means that is approved by 
the State and acceptable to the 
Secretary.’’ In addition, pursuant to 
section 1903(t)(9) of the Act, a State 
must demonstrate to the satisfaction of 
the Secretary that the State is 
conducting adequate oversight, 
including the routine tracking of 
meaningful use attestations and 
reporting mechanisms. 
a. Common Methods of Demonstration 
in Medicare and Medicaid 
As proposed, in the final rule, we are 
adopting a common method for 
demonstrating meaningful use in both 
the Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
incentive programs, for the same 
reasons we have a uniform definition of 
meaningful use. The demonstration 
methods we adopt for Medicare would 
automatically be available to the States 
for use in their Medicaid programs. The 
Medicare methods are segmented into 
two parts, as discussed in section II.4.b 
of this final rule. States seeking to

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
modify or propose alternative 
demonstration methods must submit the 
proposed methods for prior CMS 
approval. This process is discussed 
more fully in section II.D.7.b.2.c. of this 
final rule. 
b. Methods for Demonstration of the 
Stage 1 Criteria of Meaningful Use 
Our final regulations, at § 495.8, will 
require that for CY 2011, EPs 
demonstrate that they satisfy each of the 
fifteen objectives and their associated 
measures of the core set listed at 
§ 495.6(d) and five of the objectives and 
their associated measures from the 
menu set listed at § 495.6(e) unless 
excluded as described in § 495.6(a)(2). 
(An exclusion will reduce the number of 
objectives/measures the EP must satisfy 
by the number that is equal to the EP’s 
exclusions. For example, an EP that can 
exclude two menu objectives/measures 
is required to satisfy only three of the 
objectives and associated measures from 
the menu set. Similarly, an exclusion 
will reduce the number of core 
objectives/measures that apply). We 
permit only those exclusions that are 
specifically indicated in the description 
of each objective and its associated 
measure (§ 495.6(d) for the core set and 
§ 495.6(e) for the menu set). If an 
exclusion exists and the EP meets the 
criteria for it, the EP would report to 
CMS or the States that fact rather than 
demonstrating that they satisfy the 
objective and associated measure. At 
§ 495.8, we will require that for FY 
2011, eligible hospitals and CAHs 
demonstrate that they satisfy each of the 
fourteen objectives and their associated 
measures of the core set listed at 
§ 495.6(f) and five of objectives and their 
associated measures from the menu set 
listed at § 495.6(g) unless excluded as 
described in § 495.6(b)(2). As with EPs, 
all exclusions are specifically indicated, 
in the description of the objective and 
associated measures (§ 495.6(f) for the 
core set and § 495.6(g) for the menu set) 
and an exclusion will reduce the 
number of objectives and associated 
measures an eligible hospital or CAH 
must satisfy (see above example for 
EPs). If an exclusion exists and the 
hospital meets the criteria for it, the 
eligible hospital or CAH would report to 
CMS or the States that fact rather than 
demonstrating that they satisfy the 
objective and associated measure. 
Finally, as specified in 495.316(d), for 
those participating in the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program, the State may alter 
the requirements for demonstrating that 
an EP or eligible hospital is a 
meaningful user, with regard to four 
specific objectives and measures. For 
these objectives and measures, the State 
may also choose to make a menu-set 
objective a core objective. Such State 
additions could increase the core or 
menu set objectives and measures that 
must be satisfied. 
For payment years beginning in CY 
2012 and subsequent years, our final 
regulations, at § 495.8, will require that 
for Stage 1 of meaningful use, EPs 
demonstrate that they satisfy each of the 
15 objectives and their associated 
measures of the core set listed at 
§ 495.6(d), except § 495.6(d)(4) ‘‘Report 
ambulatory quality measures to CMS or, 
in the case of Medicaid EPs, the states’’ 
and 5 of the objectives and their 
associated measures from the menu set 
listed at § 495.6(e) unless excluded as 
described in § 495.6(a)(2). The form and 
mechanism for excluding an objective 
and its associated measure is the same 
for CY2012 and subsequent years as it 
is for CY2011. The ability for States to 
add certain requirements is the same for 
CY 2012 and subsequent years as it is 
for CY 2011. The EP must demonstrate 
that they satisfy the objective 
‘‘Submitting quality measure to CMS or 
the States’’ through electronic reporting 
of clinical quality measures to CMS or 
the States, as specified in section II.A.3 
of this final rule. For payment years 
beginning in FY2012 and subsequent 
years, our final regulations, at § 495.8, 
will require that eligible hospitals and 
CAHs demonstrate that they satisfy each 
of the fourteen objectives and their 
associated measures of the core set 
listed at § 495.6(f), except § 495.6(f)(3) 
‘‘Report hospital quality measures to 
CMS or, in the case of Medicaid EPs, the 
states’’ and five of the objectives and 
associated measures from the menu set 
listed at § 495.6(g) unless excluded as 
described in § 495.6(b)(2). The form and 
mechanism for excluding an objective 
and its associated measure is the same 
for FY2012 and subsequent years as it 
is for FY2011. The ability for States to 
add certain requirements also is the 
same for FY 2012 and subsequent years 
as it is for FY 2011. The eligible hospital 
or CAH must demonstrate that they 
satisfy the objective ‘‘Submitting quality 
measure to CMS or the States’’ through 
electronic reporting of clinical quality 
measures to CMS or the States, as 
specified in section II.A.3 of this final 
rule. 
Except for the clinical quality 
measures (for which we require 
electronic reporting in CY or FY 2012 
and subsequent years as discussed 
above), satisfaction of meaningful use 
objectives and associated measures may 
be demonstrated through attestation. 
Specifically, we will require that EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs attest 
through a secure mechanism, such as 
through claims based reporting or an 
online portal. For the Medicare FFS and 
MA EHR incentive programs, CMS will 
issue additional guidance on this 
mechanism. For the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program, the States will 
include additional information in the 
State Medicaid HIT plans they submit to 
CMS to implement the program. We will 
require that an EP, eligible hospital or 
CAH would, through a one-time 
attestation following the completion of 
the EHR reporting period for a given 
payment year, identify the certified EHR 
technology they are utilizing and the 
results of their performance on all the 
measures associated with the reported 
objectives of meaningful use. We would 
require attestation through a secure 
mechanism because we do not believe 
that HIT will advance enough from its 
current state to allow for more 
automated and/or documented options 
of demonstrating meaningful use. As 
HIT matures we expect to base 
demonstration more on automated 
reporting by certified EHR technologies, 
such as the direct electronic reporting of 
measures both clinical and non clinical 
and documented participation in HIE. 
The first example is to the move from 
attestation for clinical quality measures 
to direct reporting in 2012 and 
subsequent years for EPs, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs. As HIT advances 
we expect to move more of the 
objectives away from being 
demonstrated through attestation. 
However, given the current state of HIT, 
we believe that imposing such 
demonstration requirements for 2011 
would pose significant barriers to 
participation in the EHR incentive 
programs. 
We believe that the means by which 
EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs 
demonstrate meaningful use should 
work for all provider types. We also 
believe that uniform means of 
demonstration for EPs, eligible hospitals 
and CAHs are preferred and that a 
greater burden should not be placed on 
one or the other. In addition, we do not 
believe that demonstration of 
meaningful use could require use of 
certified EHR technology beyond the 
capabilities certified according to the 
ONC FR. 
In addition to requiring electronic 
reporting of clinical quality measures 
beginning in 2012 in Medicare and 
Medicaid, we also leave open the 
possibility for CMS and/or the States to 
test options to utilize existing and 
emerging HIT products and 
infrastructure capabilities to satisfy 
other objectives of the meaningful use 
definition. The optional testing could 
involve the use of registries or the direct

electronic reporting of some measures 
associated with the objectives of the 
meaningful use definition. We do not 
require any EP, eligible hospital or CAH 
to participate in this testing in either 
2011 or 2012 in order to receive an 
incentive payment. The state of 
electronic exchange varies widely across 
the country and is dependent on 
numerous Federal, State, local, non-

this high state of flux, CMS and/or the 
States would have to issue considerable 
updated guidance to EPs, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs who wish to join in 
our efforts to explore the electronic 
exchange of information. Any testing 
should be based on the principle of 
electronic exchange of information from 
certified EHR technology either directly 
to the States or through an intermediary. 
For purposes of the programs in this 
final rule it would be counterproductive 
for an intermediary to collect 
information through paper abstraction. 
We will issue further instructions on 
the specifics for submitting attestation 
through established outreach venues. 
Comment: Several commenters 
submitted comments regarding the 
methods of demonstration for clinical 
quality measures. 
Response: We summarize and 
respond to those comments in section 
II.A.3 of this final rule. 
Comment: A few commenters 
submitted comments regarding section 
1848(o)(2)(A) of the Act, which provides 
discretion to the Secretary to provide for 
the use of alternative means for meeting 
the requirements of meaningful use in 
the case of an eligible professional 
furnishing covered professional services 
in a group practice. Some of these 
commenters suggested that CMS 
provide such an alternative means in 
the final rule, while others suggested we 
consider doing so in future rulemaking. 
Response: We did not propose any 
alternative means in the proposed rule. 
Given the per EP basis for most of the 
objectives and their associated 
measures, we did not believe group 
reporting would provide an accurate 
reflection of meaningful use. In 
addition, as the incentives payments are 
calculated on a per EP basis it is unclear 
to us how variance of meaningful use 
among EPs within the group should be 
treated. We believe the possible 
reduction in burden of attesting once 
per group versus once per EP is 
outweighed by the less accurate 
reporting, increased possibility of 
duplicate payments and decreased 
transparency. We note that many of the 
measures rely on data which could 
easily be stored at a group level such as 
a patient’s demographics or medication 
lists and any EP with access to that 
information about a patient in their 
certified EHR technology and who sees 
that same patient in the EHR reporting 
period would receive credit for that 
patient in their numerator and 
denominator. Other aspects such as the 
enabling of drug-drug, drug-allergy 
checks, using CPOE and eRx could vary 
widely from EP to EP within the same 
group. We would also be concerned 
with EPs in multi-specialty group 
practices some of whom might be 
eligible for an exclusion, while others 
would not be. As requested by 
commenters we will continue to review 
this option in future rulemaking, but for 
this final rule we do not include the 
option to demonstrate meaningful use at 
a group level. 
While we did not make changes to the 
demonstration of meaningful use 
requirements based on the comments 
above, we did make modifications to 
other aspects of the Stage 1 definition of 
meaningful use that required the 
descriptions of how many and which 
objectives and their associated measure 
EPs, eligible hospitals and CAHs to be 
altered accordingly. These changes are 
to the first paragraph of this section 
(II.4.b). 
5. Data Collection for Online Posting, 
Program Coordination, and Accurate 
Payments 
As described below, the HITECH Act 
requires the Secretary to post online the 
names of Medicare EPs and eligible 
hospitals and CAHs who are meaningful 
EHR users for the relevant payment 
year. Section 1903(t)(2) of the Act also 
requires us to ensure that EPs do not 
receive an EHR incentive payment 
under both Medicare and Medicaid. To 
fulfill these mandates, we must collect 
several data elements from EPs and 
eligible hospitals. Beyond these two 
direct HITECH Act requirements, CMS 
and the States also require certain data 
in order to accurately calculate and 
distribute the incentive payments. 
a. Online Posting 
In the proposed rule, we said that 
section 1848(o)(3)(D) of the Act requires 
the Secretary to list in an easily 
understandable format the names, 
business addresses, and business phone 
numbers of the Medicare EPs and, as 
determined appropriate by the 
Secretary, of group practices receiving 
incentive payments for being 
meaningful EHR users under the 
Medicare FFS program on our Internet 
Web site. We will not post information 
on group practices because we will not 
base incentive payments at the group 
practice level. Section 1886(n)(4)(B) of 
the Act, as added by section 4102(c) of 
the HITECH Act, requires the Secretary 
to list in an easily understandable 
format the names and other relevant 
data, as she determines appropriate, of 
eligible hospitals and CAHs who are 
meaningful EHR users under the 
Medicare FFS program, on our Internet 
Web site. Eligible hospitals and CAHs 
will have the opportunity to review the 
list before the list is publicly posted. 
Sections 1853(m)(5) and 1853(l)(7) of 
the Act, as added by sections 4101(c) 
and 4102(c) of the HITECH Act, require 
the Secretary to post the same 
information for EPs and eligible 
hospitals in the MA program as would 
be required if they were in the Medicare 
FFS program. Additionally, the 
Secretary must post the names of the 
qualifying MA organizations receiving 
the incentive payment or payments. We 
would collect the information necessary 
to post the name, business address and 
business phone numbers of all EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs 
participating in the Medicare FFS and 
MA EHR incentive programs, and to 
post this information on our Web site. 
The HITECH Act did not require 
Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals to 
be identified online so we will not do 
so. 
We did not receive any comments and 
we are finalizing these provisions as 
proposed. 
b. Program Election Between Medicare 
FFS/MA and Medicaid for EPs 
In the proposed rule, we said section 
1903(t)(2) of the Act prohibits an EP 
from receiving incentive payments 
under the Medicaid program unless the 
EP has waived any rights to incentive 
payments under the Medicare FFS or 
MA programs. Furthermore, section 
1903(t)(7) of the Act requires the 
Secretary to assure no duplication of 
funding with respect to the Medicaid 
program, and the physician and MA 
incentive payments under sections 
1848(o) and 1853(l) of the Act. This 
waiver and non-duplication 
requirement applies only to EPs meeting 
both the Medicare FFS/MA and 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs 
eligibility criteria, and does not apply to 
hospitals (which, if eligible, could 
receive incentive payments from both 
Medicare and Medicaid 
simultaneously). Section 495.10 allows 
an EP meeting the eligibility criteria for 
both the Medicare FFS/MA and 
Medicaid programs to participate in 
either program. We would also allow an 
EP to change his or her election once 
during the life of the EHR incentive 
programs after making the initial 
election, for payment years 2014 and

srobinson on DSKHWCL6B1PROD with RULES2
 44438 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
before. We believe this one-time 
election rule allows an EP whose patient 
volume no longer makes him or her 
eligible for the Medicaid program to 
nevertheless continue to receive 
incentive payments that would 
encourage the meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. For example, 
an EP who moves to a different practice 
or geographically relocates practices 
may reduce his or her Medicaid patient 
volume, and therefore become ineligible 
for the Medicaid incentive payments. 
Allowing this EP to continue to receive 
incentive payments under Medicare (if 
eligible) continues the availability to the 
EP of the incentive for meaningfully 
using EHR technology, and would allow 
EPs a certain amount of flexibility in 
their operations. While allowing this 
flexibility creates administrative 
complexity, we believe a significant 
number of EPs could have their 
participation in the EHR incentive 
programs endangered due to changing 
circumstances unrelated to the EHR 
incentive programs. 
In the proposed rule, we proposed at 
495.10(e)(5), that an EP switching 
program is ‘‘placed in the payment year 
the EP would have been in, had the EP 
not switched programs.’’ For example, if 
an EP decides to switch after receiving 
his or her Medicare FFS incentive 
payment for their second payment year, 
then the EP would be in its third 
payment year for purposes of the 
Medicaid incentive payments. For the 
final rule, we are clarifying that the EP 
is ‘‘placed in the payment year the EP 
would have been in had the EP begun 
in and remained in the program to 
which he or she has switched.’’ We have 
modified 495.10(e)(5) accordingly. 
We believe this clarification is 
necessary in order to address comments 
we received on non-consecutive 
payments. As outlined in II.A.1.c and d 
of this final rule, the definition of first, 
second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth 
payment year differs across the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
Section 1848(o)(1)(E)(ii) of the Act 
requires that the second Medicare 
payment year be successive to the first 
payment year and immediately follow 
it. Similarly, the third payment year 
must immediately follow the second, 
and so on. Thus, as explained in 
II.A.1.c., ‘‘if a Medicare EP receives an 
incentive in CY2011, but does not 
successfully demonstrate meaningful 
use or otherwise fails to qualify for the 
incentive in CY2012, CY2012 still 
counts as one of the EP’s five payment 
years and they would only be able to 
receive an incentive under the Medicare 
EHR incentive program for three more 
years.’’ The same rule, however, does 
not apply to the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. For that program, EP 
payments may generally be non- 
consecutive. If an EP does not receive an 
incentive payment for a given CY or FY 
then that year would not constitute a 
payment year. For example, if a 
Medicaid EP receives incentives in 
CY2011 and CY2012, but fails to qualify 
for an incentive in CY 2013, they would 
still be potentially eligible to receive 
incentives for an additional four 
payment years. 
The rules on consecutive payment, 
discussed above, govern how an EP 
should be treated after switching from 
the Medicaid to the Medicare EHR 
incentive program, or vice versa. As 
stated above, we believe that an EP that 
switches from the Medicaid to the 
Medicare program should be treated in 
the same manner as if such EP had 
started in the Medicare program. 
Payment years that are skipped in the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program thus 
become payment years that count 
against the EP’s five years of payment in 
Medicare. For example, an EP that 
receives nonconsecutive payment under 
Medicaid for CYs 2011 and 2013 (but 
skips CY 2012), and then switches to the 
Medicare program in CY 2014, is in the 
fourth payment year in 2014, and is 
limited to that payment year’s limit on 
incentive payments. Such an EP may 
receive only one more year of incentive 
payments under the Medicare EHR 
incentive program. We believe this rule 
is equitable, given that, had the EP 
started in the Medicare program, the EP 
would not have been able to benefit 
from non-consecutive payments 
available under the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. We see no reason 
why EPs that switch from the Medicaid 
to the Medicare program should be 
treated differently from those who 
initially began in the Medicare program, 
and believe that any other rule might 
encourage gaming on the part of eligible 
professionals. 
By the same token, an EP that 
switches from the Medicare to the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program will 
not be penalized for non-consecutive 
payment years accrued while in the 
Medicare program. For example, an EP 
that receives nonconsecutive payment 
under Medicare for CYs 2011 and 2013 
(but skips CY 2012), and then switches 
to the Medicaid program in CY 2014, is 
in the third year of payment in 2014, 
and is potentially eligible to receive 
three additional years of payment under 
Medicaid (after 2014), for a total of six 
years of payment. Similar to our 
rationale described in the paragraph 
above, we do not believe an EP that 
switches to the Medicaid program 
should be treated differently from the 
EP that initially begins in the Medicaid 
program, as once the EP switches to the 
Medicaid program, there is no statutory 
requirement that the payment year 
ordering be consecutive. 
We believe it is self-evident that an EP 
switching to a new program is subject to 
the requirements of such new program. 
Thus, for example, an EP switching 
from Medicaid to Medicare might be 
subject to a higher stage of meaningful 
use upon moving to the Medicare 
program. The EP also would be subject 
to fewer years of payment and to the 
requirement that no incentive payments 
may be made after 2016. 
Finally, even after lining up the 
payment years, it is possible for an EP 
to exceed the payment cap under 
Medicaid by switching programs at the 
right time. We do not believe that the 
Congress intended for the payment caps 
to be exceeded under any circumstance, 
and therefore proposed that no EP 
should receive more than the maximum 
incentive available to them under 
Medicaid, which is the higher of the two 
caps. The last year incentive payment 
would be reduced if awarding the EP 
the full amount would exceed the 
overall maximum available under 
Medicaid. This is possible if an EP 
receives their first two payment years 
from Medicare and then the last four 
from Medicaid, as the cap would be 
exceeded by $250. If the EP receives the 
HPSA bonus available under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program, 
this amount could be as much as $4,450. 
An EP who switches from Medicaid to 
Medicare could potentially exceed the 
Medicare threshold in a number of 
circumstances; however, since they will 
not be allowed to exceed the Medicaid 
threshold under any circumstance, we 
would pay the incentive for which they 
are eligible for a given payment year in 
whichever program they are in for that 
payment year until they exceed the 
Medicaid threshold. No incentive 
payments will be made to any EP that 
would allow the EP to exceed the 
Medicaid threshold. We anticipate that 
this would result in a prorated final year 
incentive payment. Finally, we 
proposed that the last year for making 
an incentive payment program switch 
would be CY 2014. In making this 
proposal, we considered that it is both 
the last year an EP can enroll in the 
Medicare EHR incentive program, and 
also the last year before the payment 
adjustments under Medicare can begin. 
Comment: We received comments 
requesting clarification on when an EP 
could make their one switch. 
Response: As described in our 
example, the EP could make their one

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
switch anytime after the receipt of an 
incentive payment under either the 
Medicare or Medicaid program. Since 
this policy would also apply to other 
program changes (for example, changing 
from one State to another, or updating 
registration data elements), we want to 
clarify when program registration 
changes can take place. An EP, eligible 
hospital or CAH sets into motion receipt 
of the incentive payment when they 
attempt to demonstrate meaningful use 
or demonstrate to the State efforts to 
adopt, implement, or upgrade to 
certified EHR technology. Therefore, 
prior to their first successful attempt to 
demonstrate meaningful use or 
demonstrate to the State efforts to adopt, 
implement, or upgrade to certified EHR 
technology, the EP could change their 
registration in either the Medicare or 
Medicaid EHR incentive program as 
many times as they wish. Furthermore, 
EPs and hospitals selecting the 
Medicaid incentive program may also 
switch freely prior to payment as 
described here. However, there may 
only be one payment from one State in 
any one payment year. 
After consideration of the public 
comment received, we are modifying 
the provision at § 495.10(e)(2) to ‘‘(2) 
After receiving at least one EHR 
incentive payment, may switch between 
the two EHR incentive programs only 
one time, and only for a payment year 
before 2015’’. This modification better 
reflects our clarification in response to 
the comment received on the ability to 
switch between programs. For the final 
rule, we have made a few other 
technical changes to § 495.10, in 
addition to the changes made to 
§ 495.10(e)(2) and (e)(5). 
c. Data To Be Collected 
In addition to information regarding 
the demonstration of meaningful use, in 
§ 495.10 of this final rule we would 
collect the following administrative data 
for the Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
incentive programs to fulfill our 
requirements of online posting, 
avoidance of duplication of incentive 
payments, and to ensure accurate and 
timely incentive payments: 
• Name, NPI, business address, and 
business phone of each EP or eligible 
hospital. 
• Taxpayer Identification Number 
(TIN) to which the EP or eligible 
hospital wants the incentive payment 
made. For Medicaid EPs this must be 
consistent with assignment rules at 
§ 495.10. 
• For EPs, whether they elect to 
participate in the Medicare EHR 
incentive programs or the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program. 
• For eligible hospitals and CAHs, 
their CCN. 
To coordinate with the States to avoid 
duplication of payments, we would 
make available to the States through a 
single National Level Repository (NLR) 
the following additional data: 
• Whether an EP or eligible hospital 
is a meaningful EHR user, and 
• The remittance date and amount of 
any incentive payments made to an EP 
or eligible hospital. 
• Other information as specified by 
CMS. 
CMS, our contractors, and the States 
will have access to these data elements 
through the NLR maintained by CMS. 
The States will have to provide 
information to us on whether EPs or 
eligible hospitals are eligible for the 
Medicaid incentive program, whether 
EPs or eligible hospitals participating in 
the Medicaid program are meaningful 
EHR users, and when any Medicaid 
incentive payments are made and the 
amount of the payment. We will put in 
place processes for an EP or eligible 
hospital to change their information, 
including the one-time switch in EHR 
incentive program election by EPs. 
Comment: We received comments 
that some EPs do not use TINs, but 
rather the EP’s Social Security Number 
(SSN). 
Response: In these cases the EP would 
submit a TIN, which is their SSN. An 
incorporated EP would have a TIN for 
the corporation that would be an EIN. 
The EP’s own TIN remains his/her SSN. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested clarification on whether the 
business address is the physical location 
or the mailing address. 
Response: We believe that the 
HITECH Act required reporting of this 
information to assist the public in 
identifying meaningful EHR users. We 
believe the practice location address 
serves this purpose better than the 
mailing address. However we will allow 
EPs to enter an alternate address for 
posting purposes but will not allow that 
address to be a post office box. 
Comment: Commenters suggested that 
States would be allowed to determine 
the requirements associated with 
Medicaid provider TIN assignments. 
Response: We discuss the 
requirements associated with TIN 
assignment in 495.10(f) and in the 
requirements associated with SMHPs in 
this preamble at section 495.332 
SMHPs. States are responsible for 
making sure the providers are providing 
an acceptable TIN, consistent with the 
regulations at 495.10(f), which states 
that providers may only assign to 
certain TINs. 
We clarified 495.10(f), to reflect this 
and other changes. 
Comment: CMS received numerous 
comments about the schedule for and 
State’s role in the national single 
repository where CMS will collect data 
elements on all registrants. 
Response: The technological 
requirements and systems interfaces are 
outside this regulation and we look 
forward to providing additional 
guidance. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended a shorter record retention 
period that the ten years proposed. 
Commenters recommended periods 
ranging from three to eight years. The 
reasons given for a shorter time period 
were the cost of record retention, no 
perceived need for a retention period 
longer than the incentive period, rapid 
changes in EHR technology and 
consistency with other unspecified 
retention requirements. 
Response: After reviewing the 
comments, we agree with commenters 
that ten years is longer than necessary 
to ensure the integrity of the program. 
In considering a shorter retention 
period, we believe that there may be 
cause to look over the entire incentive 
period. As a Medicaid EP would be 
eligible for incentives over a six-year 
period if they successfully receive an 
incentive each year and that is the 
longest such period available to any 
participant in the Medicare and 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs, we 
adopt a new retention period of six 
years for this final rule. 
Comment: We received a comment 
suggesting that Medicare adopt an 
appeals process similar to the one 
proposed for Medicaid. 
Response: We expect to address 
Medicare appeals in future guidance. 
6. Hospital-Based Eligible Professionals 
Section 1848(o)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(a) of the HITECH 
Act, states that hospital-based EPs are 
not eligible for the Medicare incentive 
payments. Similarly, the majority of 
hospital-based EPs will not be eligible 
for Medicaid incentive payments under 
1903(t)(2)(A) of the Act (the only 
exception to this rule is for those 
practicing predominantly in an FQHC or 
RHC). Sections 4101(a) and 4201(a) of 
the HITECH Act originally defined the 
term ‘‘hospital-based eligible 
professional’’ to mean an EP, such as a 
pathologist, anesthesiologist, or 
emergency physician, who furnishes 
substantially all of his or her Medicare- 
covered professional services during the 
relevant EHR reporting period in a 
hospital setting (whether inpatient or 
outpatient) through the use of the

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
facilities and equipment of the hospital, 
including the hospital’s qualified EHRs. 
Following publication of our proposed 
rule, Congress modified the definition of 
hospital-based EPs. More specifically, 
on April 15, 2010, President Obama 
signed into law the Continuing 
Extension Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111–157) 
which, in Section 5, made the following 
changes to the Social Security Act as it 
applies to both the Medicare and 
Medicare EHR incentives for EPs: 
(1) Medicare—Section 
1848(o)(1)(C)(ii) of the Social Security 
Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w–4(o)(1)(C)(ii)) is 
amended by striking ‘setting (whether 
inpatient or outpatient)’ and inserting 
‘inpatient or emergency room setting’. 
(2) Medicaid—Section 1903(t)(3)(D) of 
the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1396b(t)(3)(D)) is amended by striking 
‘setting (whether inpatient or 
outpatient)’ and inserting ‘inpatient or 
emergency room setting’. 
These amendments were effective as 
if included in the enactment of the 
HITECH Act. 
The above sections indicate that the 
determination of whether an EP is a 
hospital-based EP shall be made on the 
basis of the site of service, as defined by 
the Secretary, and without regard to any 
employment or billing arrangement 
between the EP and any other provider. 
For example, the hospital-based 
determination for an EP would not be 
affected by whether the EP is an 
employee of the hospital, under a 
contractual relationship with the 
hospital, or with respect to whether he 
or she has made a reassignment to the 
hospital for Part B billing purposes. 
In addition, as discussed below, 
section 1848(a)(7)(D) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(b) of the HITECH 
Act, exempts hospital-based EPs from 
the downward payment adjustment 
applied under section 1848(a)(7)(A)(i) of 
the Act to covered professional services 
provided during a payment year by EPs 
who are not meaningful EHR users for 
the relevant payment year beginning in 
2015. 
Based on section 4101(a) of the 
HITECH Act (and prior to the 
amendments in the Continuing 
Extension Act of 2010), we proposed 
that an EP would be a hospital-based EP 
and therefore ineligible to receive a 
Medicare or Medicaid EHR incentive 
payment if more than 90 percent of their 
services are provided in the following 
place of service (POS) codes for HIPAA 
standard transactions: 21—Inpatient 
Hospital, 22—Outpatient Hospital, 23— 
Emergency Room. 
In addition, because of concerns that 
some primary care EPs who provide 
services to Medicare and Medicaid 
beneficiaries would be ineligible for the 
incentive payments under this proposed 
definition, in the proposed rule, we 
asked for comments on whether we 
should use another method for defining 
hospital-based EPs. We estimated that 
under this proposal, 12–13 percent of 
family practitioners under Medicare 
would be considered hospital-based. We 
did not have corresponding data for 
Medicaid EPs. 
Comment: Many congressional 
representatives, hospital associations, 
individual providers and other 
commenters indicated that they 
believed that the proposal would 
inappropriately exclude from receiving 
EHR incentive payments EPs practicing 
in ambulatory settings such as those that 
practice in hospital provider-based 
departments (referred to by most 
commenters as ‘‘outpatient centers and 
clinics’’). They indicated these centers 
and clinics provide services similar to 
services furnished by EPs in private 
offices. Many suggested that this 
definition may inhibit hospital 
investments in their outpatient primary 
care sites. Commenters believe the 
absence of any EP incentive payment in 
these settings may discourage hospitals 
from adopting EHR in ambulatory 
settings, particularly if doing so requires 
the purchase of an ambulatory-based 
EHR system (or an ambulatory 
component to be added to the hospital’s 
EHR system). This is because the 
hospital’s total incentive payment is 
based on total inpatient services. A 
hospital with a large outpatient 
department will not receive a higher 
incentive payment as a result of their 
outpatient services. These commenters 
indicated that ambulatory care EHRs are 
very different from inpatient EHRs 
because of the inherent differences 
between the types of care provided in 
each setting. Commenters differed 
somewhat to the extent that they 
provided specific alternatives. Some 
commenters went so far as to suggest 
that all EPs should be eligible to receive 
EHR incentive payments, regardless of 
where they practice. 
Response: The changes to the 
hospital-based definition that are 
included in the Continuing Extension 
Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111–157) discussed 
above address commenters concerns 
about ambulatory settings. These 
changes have been incorporated into the 
final rule. An EP will be a hospital- 
based EP and therefore ineligible to 
receive a Medicare (or Medicaid) EHR 
incentive payment if more than 90 
percent of their Medicare (or Medicaid) 
services are provided in the following 
two place of service (POS) codes for 
HIPAA standard transactions: 21— 
Inpatient Hospital, 23—Emergency 
Room. 
Comment: Some commenters argued 
that the proposed rule failed to make a 
critical distinction between hospital- 
based EPs who primarily use an EHR 
paid for and maintained by the hospital 
and those that did not. Some 
commenters suggested that an EP 
should be eligible for an EHR incentive 
payment if he or she had contributed 15 
percent or more toward the cost of 
acquiring or maintaining the certified 
EHR. Some commenters requested that 
CMS change the definition of a hospital- 
based EP to read: ‘‘An EP who furnishes 
90 percent or more of his or her covered 
professional services in the CY 
preceding the payment year in a 
hospital setting and primarily through 
the use of the qualified electronic health 
records of the hospital.’’ The 
commenters believed that Congress’s 
intent was to exclude only those EPs 
using qualified EHRs of the hospital, 
and that their approach would allow 
separate EHR incentive payments for 
EPs who have developed cutting-edge, 
patient centered EHR modules, thereby 
allowing for a clinical specificity not 
currently available in more generalized, 
hospital-wide EHR systems. 
Commenters stated that these EHR 
technologies are currently used in 
hospital settings and interoperate with 
hospital systems, but are paid for and 
primarily maintained by physician 
groups who see patients in hospital 
settings. The commenters indicate that 
these physician groups continue to 
invest in their EHRs through 
improvements, ongoing maintenance, 
and support staff employed to ensure 
optimal use of such technology. The 
commenters indicated that many early 
health IT champions, including 
hospital-based anesthesiologists, 
radiologists, pathologists, hospitalists, 
emergency medicine physicians, and 
neonatal physicians would be 
negatively affected by the proposal. 
These comments would apply to EP 
services provided in all hospital 
settings, including inpatient, outpatient, 
and emergency rooms. 
Response: The statute, as now 
amended, indicates that hospital-based 
EPs are those who furnish substantially 
all their services in an inpatient or 
emergency room setting, such as a 
pathologist, anesthesiologist, or 
emergency physician, and who do so 
using the facility and equipment, 
including qualified electronic health 
care records, of the hospital. While 
commenters focused on the statutory 
language: ‘‘* * * including qualified 
electronic health care records of the 
hospital’’, they did not address the

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
broader meaning of the section which 
also includes the requirement that 
hospital-based EPs are those who 
furnish services ‘‘using the facility and 
equipment’’, including qualified 
electronic health care records of the 
hospital. We believe both phrases 
together are intended to provide an 
explanation of why hospital-based EPs 
are to be excluded from receiving EHR 
incentive payments (that is, that they 
would typically use the facilities and 
equipment, including the EHR, of the 
hospital and that therefore it would 
represent double payment if both 
hospitals and hospital-based EPs were 
to be paid incentives). We do not 
believe that the intent of this language 
was to require CMS to evaluate each EP 
as to whether they are using the EHR of 
the hospital. Further, the commenters 
did not address the significance of the 
next sentence of the statute, which 
clearly indicates that: ‘‘The 
determination of whether an eligible 
professional is a hospital-based eligible 
professional shall be made on the basis 
of the site of service * * *’’. Since 
Congress directed that site of service 
must be the determinant of whether an 
EP is hospital-based, we could not use 
individualized determinations of 
whether an EP is using the EHR of the 
hospital to deliver his or her services. 
Also, the subsequent legislation in the 
Continuing Extension Act of 2010 is 
consistent with the interpretation that 
the determination of whether an EP is 
hospital-based is based on the place 
where the EP furnishes services, as that 
subsequent legislation further limited 
hospital-based to those EPs providing 
substantially all services in the 
emergency room or inpatient hospital 
settings. Furthermore, our final policy is 
that eligible hospitals must demonstrate 
meaningful use based upon all 
applicable cases in the inpatient (21) 
and emergency department (23) site of 
service codes. Therefore, there would be 
duplication in measuring meaningful 
use for the purposes of making EHR 
incentive payments in the scenario 
proposed by these commenters. 
The HITECH Act does not define the 
term ‘‘hospital’’ for purposes of 
establishing a definition of hospital- 
based EPs for Medicare and Medicaid. 
However, section 1861(e) of the Act 
defines the term a ‘‘hospital’’ to mean an 
institution that ‘‘is primarily engaged in 
providing, by or under the supervision 
of physicians, to inpatients (A) 
diagnostic services and therapeutic 
services for medical diagnosis, 
treatment, and care of injured, disabled, 
or sick persons, or (B) rehabilitation 
services for the rehabilitation of injured, 
disabled, or sick persons.’’ Therefore, 
clearly EPs that practice primarily in 
inpatient hospital settings, as referenced 
in section 1861(e) of the Act, would be 
considered hospital-based EPs. 
We will consider the use of place of 
service (POS) codes on physician claims 
to determine whether an EP furnishes 
substantially all of their professional 
services in a hospital setting and is, 
therefore, hospital-based. This code set 
is required for use in the 
implementation guide adopted as the 
national standard for electronic 
transmission of professional health care 
claims under the provisions of the 
Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). 
HIPAA directed the Secretary of HHS to 
adopt national standards for electronic 
transactions. These standard 
transactions require all health plans and 
providers to use standard code sets to 
populate data elements in each 
transaction. The Transaction and Code 
Set Rule (65 FR 50312) adopted the ASC 
X12N–837 Health Care Claim: 
Professional, volumes 1 and 2, version 
4010, as the standard for electronic 
submission of professional claims. This 
standard names the POS code set 
currently maintained by CMS as the 
code set to be used for describing sites 
of service in such claims and is 
available at http://www4.cms.gov/
PlaceofServiceCodes/Downloads/
posdatabase110509.pdf. 
From this code set, we would 
consider the use of the following POS 
codes to determine whether an EP is a 
hospital-based eligible professional for 
Medicare: 
• 21—Inpatient Hospital—is a 
facility, other than psychiatric, which 
primarily provides diagnostic, 
therapeutic (both surgical and 
nonsurgical), and rehabilitation services 
by, or under, the supervision of 
physicians, to patients admitted for a 
variety of medical conditions. 
• 23—Emergency Room, Hospital—is 
a portion of a hospital where emergency 
diagnosis and treatment of illness or 
injury is provided. 
Comment: Most commenters were 
supportive of the proposal to define 
‘‘substantially all’’ of his or her covered 
professional services in a hospital 
setting as EPs who furnish at least 90 
percent of his/her services in a hospital 
setting. However, some commenters 
expressed concerns that this threshold 
will be too high starting in 2015 when 
the time comes to determine which EPs 
should be subject to penalties for failure 
to become meaningful users of certified 
EHR technology. A few commenters 
misunderstood the proposal and 
requested that a hospital-based EP be 
defined as one who provides at least 90 
percent of his or her services, defined as 
encounters and not as charges. 
Response: The statutory definition of 
hospital-based EP provides that to be 
considered a hospital-based EP, the EP 
must provide ‘‘substantially all’’ of his or 
her covered professional services in a 
hospital setting. Therefore, we must 
identify the minimum percentage of an 
EP’s covered professional services that 
must be provided in a hospital setting 
in order for the EP to be considered as 
providing ‘‘substantially all’’ of his or 
her covered professional services in a 
hospital setting. Consistent with the 
statute, we proposed to make this 
determination on the basis of services 
performed by each EP, not the charges 
for each EP. We are finalizing the 
proposed definition of ‘‘substantially 
all’’ as furnishing at least 90 percent of 
services in a hospital setting. We believe 
a 90 percent threshold certainly would 
qualify as ‘‘substantial.’’ 
Comment: Representatives of 
surgeons asked that CMS make an 
accommodation to the hospital-based 
definition to account for services paid 
under a global fee. 
Response: The determination of 
whether or not an EP is hospital-based 
is determined individually for each EP. 
A global fee is a single payment for a 
bundle of services, some of which could 
be performed in a hospital such as major 
surgery or hospital visits, whereas some 
could be performed in an office such as 
follow-up visits, CMS does not have 
data, for the place of service for services 
performed by individual EPs when the 
services are paid as part of a global fee. 
We considered possibilities for using 
national level estimates for individual 
services typically performed under 
global fees as proxies for services 
provided by individual EPs. However, 
this would add significant additional 
operational complexity to the 
determination of hospital-based status 
and we have not pursued this approach. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested that CMS establish a process 
by which EPs could know in advance of 
a payment year whether CMS 
considered them as being hospital-based 
and therefore ineligible for an incentive 
payment. 
Response: To the extent practical, we 
intend on establishing a process 
whereby the EP would know his/her 
hospital-based status during the 
registration period. We plan to provide 
information to EPs regarding their 
hospital-based status as early as possible 
(that is, no later than early in each 
payment year). As indicated in the 
proposed rule, we will make a 
determination for Medicare incentive

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
payment purposes, as to whether or not 
an EP is hospital-based by annually 
analyzing an EP’s claims history from 
the prior year. In the proposed rule we 
indicated that we would use claims data 
from the prior calendar year to make 
hospital-based determinations for EPs. 
However, in order to provide 
information regarding the hospital- 
based status of each EP at the beginning 
of each payment year, we will need to 
use claims data from an earlier period. 
Therefore, we will use claims data from 
the prior fiscal year (October through 
September). Under this approach, the 
hospital-based status of each EP would 
be reassessed each year, using claims 
data from the fiscal year preceding the 
payment year. The hospital-based status 
will be available for viewing beginning 
in January of each payment year. For 
Medicaid purposes, State Medicaid 
agencies will make the determination 
about whether or not an EP is hospital- 
based by analyzing an EP’s Medicaid 
claims data, or in the case of EPs who 
deliver care via Medicaid managed care 
programs, by analyzing either encounter 
data or other equivalent data sources, at 
the State’s option. For purposes of 
making this determination, States would 
be permitted to use data either from the 
prior fiscal or calendar year. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are revising the 
definition of hospital based EPs in this 
final rule. An EP will be defined as 
being hospital-based and therefore 
ineligible to receive an EHR incentive 
payment under either Medicare or 
Medicaid, regardless of the type of 
service provided, if more than 90 
percent of their services are identified as 
being provided in places of service 
classified under two place of service 
codes 21 (Inpatient Hospital) or 23 
Emergency Room, Hospital. We plan to 
reassess the hospital-based status of 
each EP for Medicare purposes each 
year, using claims data from the fiscal 
year immediately preceding the 
payment year. Based on preliminary 
claims data from the first 9 months of 
2009, CMS currently estimates that, 
under this final definition of hospital- 
based EPs, about 14 percent of Medicare 
EPs (physicians) would be considered 
hospital-based and thus not eligible to 
receive any incentive payments. We do 
not have any data on Medicaid 
practitioners. 
7. Interaction With Other Programs 
In the proposed rule, we described 
how the HITECH Act addresses 
interactions between the Medicare EHR 
incentive program and the E-prescribing 
Incentive Program authorized by 
MIPPA. Under section 1848(m)(2)(D) of 
the Act, as added by section 
4101(f)(2)(B) of the HITECH Act, if a 
Medicare FFS or MA EP receives an 
incentive payment from the Medicare 
EHR incentive program, the EP (or 
group practice) is not eligible to also 
receive the incentive payment under the 
E-prescribing Incentive Program created 
by MIPPA. Given the payment timelines 
in this final rule for the Medicare EHR 
incentive program and the existing 
payment timeline for the E-prescribing 
Incentive Program, we will know 
whether an EP received a Medicare EHR 
incentive payment before the e- 
prescribing Incentive Program payment 
is calculated. Thus we will exclude 
those EPs (or group practices) who 
accept a Medicare EHR incentive 
payment for a given year from being 
eligible for the e-prescribing Incentive 
Program payment for that same year. 
EPs receiving a Medicaid EHR incentive 
payment would remain eligible for the 
Medicare MIPAA E-Prescribing 
Incentive Program payment. 
As the HITECH Act does not specify 
any other restrictions on participation in 
other programs and participation in the 
Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive 
programs, we do not propose any other 
restrictions. There may be opportunities 
to avoid duplication of reporting 
requirements among our various 
programs. In section II.A.3. of this final 
rule, we discuss how we will avoid 
duplication of reporting requirements 
for clinical quality measures. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested more information on efforts to 
avoid duplication of requirements and 
highly encouraged CMS to do 
everything it could in this regard. 
Response: We address comments on 
the avoidance of duplication of 
requirements in several other areas of 
this rule where more specifics can be 
provided. 
Comment: Commenters generally 
supported our proposal to only apply 
the limitation of participation in 
multiple programs to the limitation 
outlined in the HITECH Act. 
Response: We continue to believe that 
providers should be able to participate 
in every program for which they are 
statutorily eligible and therefore are 
maintaining our proposal to only limit 
Medicare EPs from receiving either the 
Medicare EHR incentive payment or the 
Medicare E–Prescribing incentive 
payment. 
B. Medicare Fee for Service Incentives 
1. Incentive Payments for Eligible 
Professionals (EP) 
Section 1848(o)(1)(A) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4101(a) of the 
HITECH Act, provides for incentive 
payments to EPs who are meaningful 
users of certified EHR technology during 
the relevant EHR reporting periods. 
Section 1848(o)(1)(A)(i) of the Act 
provides that EPs who are meaningful 
EHR users during the relevant EHR 
reporting period are entitled to an 
incentive payment amount, subject to an 
annual limit, equal to 75 percent of the 
Secretary’s estimate of the Medicare 
allowed charges for covered 
professional services furnished by the 
EP during the relevant payment year. 
Under section 1848(o)(1)(B)(ii)(VI) of the 
Act, an EP is entitled to an incentive 
payment for up to 5 years. In addition, 
in accordance with section 
1848(o)(1)(A)(ii) of the Act, there shall 
be no incentive payments made with 
respect to a year after 2016. The 
incentive payments would be disbursed 
from the Federal Supplementary 
Medical Insurance Trust Fund, as 
provided for under section 
1848(o)(1)(A)(i) of the Act. As noted in 
section II.A. of this final rule, EPs who 
qualify for both the Medicare and 
Medicaid incentive payments must elect 
to receive payments from one program 
or the other. 
a. Definitions 
In accordance with section 
1848(o)(5)(C) of the Act, we will add a 
definition of the term ‘‘eligible 
professional’’ in our regulations at 
§ 495.100 to mean a physician as 
defined under section 1861(r) of the Act. 
Section 1861(r) of the Act defines the 
term ‘‘physician’’ to mean the following 
five types of professionals, each of 
which must be legally authorized to 
practice their profession under state 
law: a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, 
a doctor of dental surgery or dental 
medicine, a doctor of podiatric 
medicine, a doctor of optometry, or a 
chiropractor. As discussed in section 
II.B.1.a of this final rule, in accordance 
with section 1848(o)(1)(C) of the Act, 
hospital-based EPs are not eligible for an 
incentive payment. 
Section 1848(o)(5)(A) of the Act 
defines covered professional services as 
having the same meaning as in section 
1848(k)(3) of the Act, that is, services 
furnished by an eligible professional for 
which payment is made under, or is 
based on, the Medicare physician fee 
schedule. 
In accordance with section 1848(a)(1) 
of the Act, the Medicare allowed charge 
for covered professional services is the 
lesser of the actual charge or the 
Medicare physician fee schedule 
amount established in section 1848 the 
Act. As specified under section 
1848(o)(1)(A)(i) of the Act, the

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Secretary’s estimate of allowed charges 
is based on claims submitted to 
Medicare no later than 2 months 
following the end of the relevant 
payment year. We proposed to codify 
these specifications and definitions in 
our regulations at 495.102. 
Comment: The commenters who 
expressed concerns about the EP 
definition under the Medicare program 
had one overall theme. It is that the 
definition is too narrow and that it 
should be more inclusive of other health 
professionals in order to serve the goals 
of the HITECH Act. The commenters 
stated that they believe that the intent 
of the electronic health records (EHR) 
legislation is to encompass a wide range 
of health professionals to incorporate 
efficient and effective EHR technology. 
Specifically, these commenters stated 
that the Medicare EP definition should 
be expanded to include nonphysician 
practitioners and health professionals 
such as physician assistants (PAs), 
nurse practitioners (NPs), clinical nurse 
specialists (CNSs), certified nurse- 
midwives (CNMs), clinical 
psychologists (CPs), clinical social 
workers (CSWs), certified registered 
nurse anesthetists (CRNAs), registered 
nurses (RNs), occupational therapists 
(OTs), and credentialed pedorthists who 
make shoes for diabetic patients. 
Additionally, we received a comment 
that the Medicare EP definition should 
recognize health professionals who 
provide health support services as 
members of an interdisciplinary health 
care team such as a team consisting of 
diabetes nurse educators, NPs, 
pharmacists, PAs, dieticians, and case 
managers. 
Representatives of rural health clinics 
(RHCs), Federally qualified health 
centers (FQHCs), ambulatory surgical 
centers (ASCs), outpatient clinics and 
dialysis facilities commented that their 
providers should also be included under 
the Medicare EP definition to qualify for 
Medicare incentive payments. These 
providers believe that they are a key set 
of contributors that will implement and 
meaningfully utilize electronic health 
care record program modules that 
directly benefit their patient 
populations. Alternatively, one of these 
commenters recommended that 
provider eligibility should be 
determined by type of service provided 
rather than by location of service and 
should include non-physician clinicians 
and providers. 
The sub-theme of the comments that 
we received on the Medicare EP 
definition is that the definition of an 
‘‘eligible provider’’ that qualifies for EHR 
incentive payments should be a 
common definition for the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs. The commenters 
believe that a uniform definition of an 
EP would be more administratively 
efficacious for the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs considering that EPs 
are permitted to switch participation 
between the Medicare and Medicaid 
incentive programs one-time after the 
initial payment year. 
An organization representing 
pathologists expressed concern that the 
Medicare EP definition, as currently 
drafted would subject certain 
pathologists to payment incentive 
penalties for not being meaningful EHR 
users if the pathologists performed less 
than 90 percent of their professional 
services in any inpatient or outpatient 
setting in the prior year. All EPs have to 
report on all Core Measures and a subset 
of clinical measures that pathologists 
could not meet in their day-to-day 
practice given the nature of pathology’s 
scope of practice. Accordingly, this 
organization recommended that CMS 
ensure that pathologists who are 
currently defined as Medicare EPs be 
considered as ‘‘non-qualifying’’ EPs, that 
are exempt from future meaningful user 
penalties. 
Response: While we appreciate the 
comments that we received on the 
Medicare EP definition, we are unable 
to expand or alter this statutory 
definition or consolidate it with the 
Medicaid program EP definition as 
suggested by the commenters. Under the 
EHR incentive payment program, the 
law provided a separate Medicare EP 
definition rather than giving the 
Secretary authority or discretion to 
determine who is a Medicare EP or, who 
is an EP for both the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs. 
Comment: A commenter requested 
clarification of the method used for 
determining Medicare incentives for EPs 
practicing in a rural health clinic. 
Response: The amount of the EHR 
incentive payment is based on the 
estimated allowed charges for all 
covered professional services furnished 
by an EP during the payment year, 
subject to the maximum payment 
amount for the payment year for the EP. 
For EPs that practice in an RHC, EHR 
incentive payments are based on the 
amount of covered professional services 
that are not part of the RHC package of 
services and are billed by the EP 
through the physician fee schedule. 
Comment: A commenter suggested 
that the definition of allowable charges 
be amended to include the RHC 
schedule of services, or allow providers 
who use UB92 and HCFA 1500 forms to 
be eligible for the EHR incentive 
payment. 
Response: The allowed charge is the 
amount that Medicare determines to be 
reasonable payment for a provider or 
service under Part B, including 
coinsurance and deductibles. RHC 
services furnished by an EP are not 
considered covered professional 
services for purposes of the Medicare 
EHR because they are not billed or paid 
under the physician fee schedule. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received on the term, 
‘‘eligible professional’’ for the Medicare 
program, we are adopting the Medicare 
EP definition in our regulations at 
§ 495.100 that state that a Medicare EP 
is a physician as defined under § 1861(r) 
of the Social Security Act. That is, a 
Medicare EP is a doctor of medicine or 
osteopathy, a doctor of dental surgery or 
dental medicine, a doctor of podiatric 
medicine, a doctor of optometry, or a 
chiropractor and a doctor who is legally 
authorized to practice their profession 
under State law. 
b. Incentive Payment Limits 
Section 1848(o)(1)(B)(i) of the Act sets 
forth the annual limits on the EHR- 
related incentive payments to EPs. 
Specifically, section 1848(o)(1)(B) of the 
Act provides that the incentive payment 
for an EP for a given payment year shall 
not exceed the following amounts: 
• For the EP’s first payment year, for 
such professional, $15,000 (or, $18,000 
if the EP’s first payment year is 2011 or 
2012). 
• For the EP’s second payment year, 
$12,000. 
• For the EP’s third payment year, 
$8,000. 
• For the EP’s fourth payment year, 
$4,000. 
• For the EP’s fifth payment year, 
$2,000. 
• For any succeeding year, $0. 
Under section 1848(o)(1)(B)(iv) of the 
Act, for EPs who predominantly furnish 
services in a geographic HPSA (as 
designated by the Secretary under 
section 332(a)(1)(A) of the Public Health 
Service (PHS) Act), the incentive 
payment limitation amounts for each 
payment year are increased by 10 
percent. Section 1848(o)(1)(B)(iii) of the 
Act also provides for a phased reduction 
in payment limits for EPs who first 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology after 2013. Specifically, 
if the EP’s first payment year is after 
2013, then the annual limit on the 
incentive payment equals the annual 
limit applicable to an EP whose first 
payment year is 2013. Accordingly, if 
the EP’s first payment year is 2014, the 
EP’s maximum incentive payment will 
be $12,000 in 2014, $8,000 in 2015, and 
$4,000 in 2016. Section 1848(o)(1)(B)(v)

 44444 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
of the Act provides that if the EP’s first 
payment year is after 2014, then the 
applicable incentive payment limit for 
such year and any subsequent year shall 
be $0. In other words, an EP who does 
not qualify to receive an EHR-related 
incentive payment prior to 2015 will not 
receive any of these incentive payments. 
Comment: One commenter believes 
that the methodology for determining 
the incentive payments under the 
incentive program does not offer each 
EP an equal incentive, despite being 
held to the same standards of adoption 
and implementation. 
Response: We are uncertain why the 
commenter believes that the 
methodology for determining the 
incentive payments under the incentive 
program does not offer each EP an equal 
incentive to adopt EHR technology. 
However, the payment methodology in 
the statute for EPs (as well as the 
methodologies for hospitals and CAHs) 
is quite prescriptive, and offers no 
discretion for us to adopt revisions 
designed to enhance incentives for 
adoption. For EPs, the HITECH Act 
defines the incentive payment amount 
as, ‘‘an amount equal to 75 percent of 
the Secretary’s estimate * * * of the 
allowed charges under this part of all 
such covered professional services 
furnished by the eligible professional 
during such year.’’ 
c. Increase in Incentive Payment for EPs 
Who Predominantly Furnish Services in 
a Geographic Health Professional 
Shortage Area (HPSA) 
Section 1848(o)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act 
provides that the amount of the annual 
incentive payment limit for each 
payment year be increased by 10 
percent for EPs who predominantly 
furnish services in an area that is 
designated by the Secretary (under 
section 332(a)(1)(A) of the PHS Act) as 
a geographic health professional 
shortage area (HPSA). This section of 
the PHS Act refers to geographic HPSAs, 
which are areas that have been 
designated by the Secretary as having a 
shortage of health professionals, based 
on the population-to-provider ratio and 
other factors. HPSAs are located in 
every State, and in both rural and urban 
areas. 
Geographic HPSAs are defined in 42 
CFR Part 5 and include primary medical 
care, dental, and mental health HPSAs. 
In accordance with the statute, we will 
increase the limits per payment year by 
10 percent for EHR-related incentive 
payments to EPs who predominantly 
furnish covered professional services in 
a geographic primary medical care, 
dental, or mental health HPSA. 
We proposed that for an EP to be 
considered as ‘‘predominantly’’ 
furnishing covered professional services 
in a geographic HPSA, more than 50 
percent of the EP’s covered professional 
services must be furnished in a 
geographic HPSA. We stated that using 
‘‘more than 50 percent’’ as the criterion 
to define ‘‘predominantly’’ is consistent 
with how the term is defined in general 
parlance as well as how the definition 
is used for purposes of other aspects of 
the Medicare program. Our data 
indicates that most physicians 
furnishing services in a HPSA furnish 
100 percent of their covered services in 
a HPSA, and only very few furnish 
services in both HPSA and non-HPSA 
areas. 
To determine whether an EP has 
furnished more than 50 percent of his/ 
her covered professional services in a 
geographic HPSA, we proposed to 
utilize frequency of services provided 
over a 1-year period from January 1 to 
December 31, rather than basing it on 
the percentage of allowed charges. We 
proposed to make the incentive 
payment to the EP based on an EP’s 
estimated allowed charges for the 
relevant payment year. 
We proposed that once we compile a 
full year of data, we would determine 
eligibility for the EHR HPSA payment 
limit increase for the payment year 
based on whether the EP provided more 
than 50 percent of his/her services in a 
geographic HPSA during the payment 
year. The determination would be made 
based on claims submitted not later than 
2 months after the end of the year. If we 
determine that the EP provided more 
than 50 percent of his/her services in a 
geographic HPSA and is therefore 
eligible for the EHR HPSA payment 
limit increase, we would then make an 
additional lump sum payment to reflect 
that increased limit amount based on 
the estimated allowable charges for that 
EP for the prior year. The additional 
amount would be paid no later than 120 
days after the end of the prior year for 
which the EP was eligible for the 10 
percent EHR HPSA payment limit 
increase. 
Most physicians furnishing services 
in a HPSA furnish 100 percent of their 
covered services in a HPSA. Section 
1848(o)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act also 
authorizes us to apply the provisions of 
sections 1833(m) and (u) of the Act in 
implementing this 10 percent EHR 
HPSA payment limit increase, as the 
Secretary determines appropriate. 
Section 1833(m) of the Act establishes 
the HPSA bonus program, which 
provides a 10 percent bonus to 
physicians who furnish Medicare 
covered professional services in a 
geographic HPSA. 
Section 1833(m)(1) of the Act 
provides that physicians who furnish 
covered professional services in a year 
in an area that is designated as a 
geographic HPSA prior to the beginning 
of the year are eligible to receive the 
HPSA bonus for services furnished 
during the current year. We have 
interpreted this to mean that bonus 
payments should continue throughout 
the current year, even if the area loses 
its designation as a geographic HPSA 
during the current year. Physicians 
furnishing Medicare-covered 
professional services in an area that is 
not designated as a geographic HPSA by 
December 31 of the prior year are not 
eligible to receive the HPSA bonus for 
the current year, even if the area is 
subsequently designated as a geographic 
HPSA during the current year. We will 
apply these same rules for the 10 
percent EHR HPSA payment limit 
increase provided under section 
1848(o)(1)(B)(iv) of the Act. 
Section 1833(m)(2) of the Act also 
provides that geographic HPSAs that 
consist of an entire county be identified 
and the bonus paid automatically. We 
publish a list annually of the zip codes 
that are in these areas on our Web site 
at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/
HPSAPSAPhysicianBonuses/
01_Overview.asp#TopOfPage. 
Physicians furnishing Medicare- 
covered professional services in a zip 
code that is on this list automatically 
receive the HPSA bonus payment. 
Physicians furnishing Medicare covered 
professional services in a zip code that 
is not on this list but that was 
designated as a geographic HPSA as of 
December 31 of the prior year must use 
a modifier when submitting a Medicare 
claim in order to receive the HPSA 
bonus. 
Comment: We received a comment 
stating that many EPs who work in a 
HPSA do so only on a part-time basis 
and that most would not qualify for the 
10 percent increase in the payment limit 
based on the proposed threshold of 
furnishing more than 50 percent of his/ 
her covered professional services in a 
geographic HPSA. The commenter 
suggested that an EP should be able to 
qualify for the ten percent increase in 
the payment limit if at least 25 percent 
of his/her covered services during an 
EHR reporting period are furnished in a 
HPSA. 
Response: The statute states that the 
annual payment limit be increased by 
ten percent for EPs who predominantly 
furnish services in a geographic HPSA. 
We continue to believe that ‘‘more than 
fifty percent’’ correctly reflects the

meaning of the word ‘‘predominantly’’ as 
used in this statute. As noted above, our 
data also indicate that most physicians 
furnish all of their services either in a 
HPSA or outside of a HPSA, and only 
very few furnish services in both HPSA 
and non-HPSA areas. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that Federally Qualified 
Health Centers (FQHCs) be eligible to 
receive the ten percent increase in the 
payment limit for EPs who 
predominantly furnish services in a 
HPSA since the FQHC is a legal entity 
that bills Medicare and receives 
payment for services provided by 
physicians. 
Response: The 10 percent increase in 
the payment limit applies to EPs who 
predominantly furnish services in a 
geographic HPSA. FQHCs and RHCs are 
not eligible for the ten percent increase 
in the payment limit because they do 
not meet the definition of EP as 
specified in section 1848(o)(5)(C) of the 
Act. Please see others sections of the 
regulation that discuss the criteria to be 
considered an EP. Additionally, we 
wish to restate that FQHCs are not 
entitled to any Medicare or Medicaid 
incentive payments under this program. 
Comment: A commenter suggested 
that ‘‘predominantly’’ be defined as the 
location where the EP provides the most 
services, so that an EP who sees patients 
in more than two locations could 
receive the increase in the payment 
limit if he/she provided more care in the 
HPSA location than any other location. 
The commenter also suggested that if 
this is too difficult to administer, we 
should accept an attestation from the 
EP. 
Response: We are aware that many 
physicians, especially in rural areas, 
furnish services in more than one 
location, and appreciate the 
commenter’s interest in making the 
HPSA payment limit increase available 
to these EPs. If we were to accept this 
recommendation, then an EP who 
worked in three locations at forty 
percent, thirty percent, and thirty 
percent time respectively, would be 
eligible for the HPSA payment limit 
increase if the first location was in a 
geographic HPSA. If the EP worked in 
four locations at thirty percent, twenty- 
five percent, twenty five percent, and 
twenty percent time respectively, he/she 
would be eligible for the HPSA payment 
limit increase if the first location was in 
a geographic HPSA. We considered this 
suggestion and concluded that lowering 
the threshold for services furnished in a 
HPSA would be inconsistent with the 
intent of the HPSA payment limit 
increase, which is to provide an 
incentive to promote the use of EHR by 
EPs who practice predominantly in 
HPSAs. Also, if an EP who worked in 
more than two locations and furnished 
services in a HPSA only thirty or forty 
percent of his/her time was eligible for 
the HPSA payment limit increase, this 
would be unfair to an EP who worked 
in two locations and spent forty-five 
percent of his/her time in a HPSA and 
fifty-five percent time in a non-HPSA, 
because this EP would not be eligible for 
the HPSA payment limit increase even 
though he/she spent more total time in 
a HPSA. 
Comment: A commenter stated that 
the proposed HPSA payment limit 
increase was being applied 
inconsistently because an EP would still 
get the payment limit increase if the 
designation was removed mid-year, and 
would not get the payment limit 
increase if the designation was added 
mid-year. 
Response: Section 1848(o)(1)(B)(iv) of 
the Act authorizes us to apply the 
provisions of the HPSA bonus program 
to the implementation of the EHR HPSA 
payment limit increase. The HPSA 
bonus is paid to physicians who furnish 
Medicare-covered professional services 
in an area that is designated as a 
geographic HPSA as of December 31 of 
the prior year. They are authorized to 
receive the HPSA bonus throughout the 
current year, even if the area loses its 
designation as a geographic HPSA 
during the current year. Physicians 
furnishing Medicare-covered 
professional services in an area that is 
not designated as a geographic HPSA as 
of December 31 of the prior year are not 
eligible to receive the HPSA bonus for 
the current year, even if the area is 
subsequently designated as a geographic 
HPSA during the current year. We 
proposed to use the same methodology 
for the HPSA EHR program, and believe 
that this is consistent with the statute. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
these provisions as proposed. 
d. Form and Timing of Payment 
Section 1848(o)(1)(D)(i) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4101(a) of the 
HITECH Act, provides that the incentive 
payments may be disbursed as a single 
consolidated payment or in periodic 
installments as the Secretary may 
specify. We proposed to make a single, 
consolidated, annual incentive payment 
to EPs. Payments would be made on a 
rolling basis, as soon as we ascertained 
that an EP had demonstrated 
meaningful use for the applicable 
reporting period (that is, 90 days for the 
first year or a calendar year for 
subsequent years), and reached the 
threshold for maximum payment. 
Section 1848(o)(1)(A) of the Act 
provides that ‘‘with respect to covered 
professional services provided by an 
eligible professional,’’ the incentive 
payment ‘‘shall be paid to the eligible 
professional (or to an employer or 
facility in the cases described in clause 
(A) of section 1842(b)(6)).’’ Section 
1842(b)(6)(A) of the Act allows for 
reassignment to an employer or entity 
with which the physician has a valid 
contractual arrangement allowing the 
entity to bill for the physician’s services. 
Therefore, we proposed that EPs would 
be allowed to reassign their incentive 
payment to their employer or an entity 
which they have a valid employment 
agreement or contract providing for 
such reassignment, consistent with all 
rules governing reassignments. We 
proposed to preclude an EP from 
reassigning the incentive payment to 
more than one employer or entity. To 
implement this requirement, we 
proposed to use the EP’s Medicare 
enrollment information to determine 
whether an EP belongs to more than one 
practice (that is, whether the EP’s 
National Provider Identifier (NPI) is 
associated with more than one practice). 
In cases where the EP was associated 
with more than one practice, we 
proposed that EPs would select one tax 
identification number to receive any 
applicable EHR incentive payment. 
As mentioned above, we proposed 
that payments would be made on a 
rolling basis, as soon as we ascertain 
that an EP has demonstrated meaningful 
use for the applicable reporting period 
(that is, 90 days for the first year or a 
calendar year for subsequent years), and 
reached the threshold for maximum 
payment. We proposed to add a new 
part 495.10(e) and (f) to permit 
reassignment of the incentive payment 
with certain limitations. The following 
is a summary of the comments we 
received and our responses. 
Comment: Several commenters, 
including one representing Rural Health 
Clinics, requested clarification of the 
statement in the proposed rule (75 FR 
1910) that an eligible professional (EP) 
is allowed to reassign his/her EHR 
incentive payment to an employer or 
other entity to which the EP has 
reassigned his/her payments for 
Medicare covered services. The 
commenters believe that the HITECH 
Act requires in such cases that any 
Medicare EHR incentive for which the 
EP qualifies must be paid to such 
employer or other entity. The 
commenters reference the phrases from 
the HITECH Act, ‘‘shall be paid’’ to an 
eligible professional (or to an employer 
or facility in cases described in the 
reassignment provisions of the Social

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Security Act). In addition, the 
commenters referenced the phrase 
regarding the transfer of an EP’s 
Medicaid EHR incentive which states 
that ‘‘such incentives are paid directly to 
such provider (or to an employer or 
facility to which such provider has 
assigned payments)’’. The commenters 
interpret these phrases to mean that an 
EP’s EHR incentive payments (both 
Medicare and Medicaid) must be paid to 
an employer or other entity to which the 
EP has reassigned payments for his/her 
services. 
Response: We do not agree with the 
commenters’ conclusions regarding to 
whom the payments must be made. As 
we stated in the proposed rule, Section 
1842(b)(6) of the Act allows, but does 
not require reassignment to an employer 
or entity with which the physician has 
a valid contractual arrangement 
allowing the employer or entity to bill 
for the physician’s services. The 
HITECH Act provisions cited by the 
commenter similarly do not require that 
the EHR incentive payment be made 
pursuant to a reassignment, but provide 
that the payment may be made directly 
to the EP or to the employer or other 
entity. A physician reassigns payment 
based on the scope of his or her 
employment or contractual 
arrangement. Based upon our 
interpretation of the applicable 
provisions, we are finalizing our 
proposal at § 495.10(f) to permit EPs to 
reassign their incentive payments to 
their employer or to an entity with 
which they have a contractual 
arrangement, consistent with all rules 
governing reassignments including part 
424, subpart F. 
We are taking this opportunity to 
remind the public that if the EP wishes 
to reassign his or her incentive payment 
to the employer or entity with which the 
EP has a contractual arrangement, the 
parties should review their existing 
contract(s) to determine whether the 
contract(s) currently provides for 
reassignment of the incentive payment 
or if the contract(s) needs to be revised. 
Reassignment of the incentive payment 
must be consistent with applicable 
Medicare laws, rules, and regulations, 
including, without limitation, those 
related to fraud, waste, and abuse. For 
Medicaid, a discussion of reassignment 
of the incentive payment is found in 
section II.D.3.e of this final rule ‘‘Entities 
Promoting the Adoption of Certified 
EHR technology.’’ 
Comment: Several commenters stated 
that the rationale and objectives of the 
HITECH Act provisions regarding 
transfer of the EP’s EHR incentives are 
merely to align EHR incentives and EHR 
costs. Therefore, they believe that the 
HITECH Act provisions support their 
view that Congressional intent was to 
prevent windfall EHR incentives to EPs 
who incur no EHR-related costs. The 
commenters also asserted that CMS’s 
failure to address this issue will require 
entities that employ or contract with 
EPs to enter into negotiations and a 
separate agreement transferring the EP’s 
EHR incentive payments to the 
employer or other entity. 
Response: We do not agree with the 
commenters’ statement that the 
Congress intended to prevent windfall 
EHR incentives to EPs who incur no 
EHR-related costs. Title IV, Division B 
of the HITECH Act establishes incentive 
payments under the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs for certain 
professionals and hospitals that 
meaningfully use certified EHR 
technology. The provisions are not 
focused solely upon the costs associated 
with the EHR technology. Rather, as we 
stated in the proposed rule (75 FR 
1849), it focuses upon the adoption, 
implementation, upgrade, or meaningful 
use of the technology. 
However, we do agree that some 
entities may have to review and/or 
negotiate current contractual 
arrangements to address the transfer of 
the incentive payments. The first 
payment year for the incentive payment 
is CY 2011, which we believe should 
afford parties sufficient time to reach a 
new agreement. For Medicaid, a 
discussion of reassignment of the 
incentive payment is found in section 
II.D.3.e of this final rule ‘‘Entities 
Promoting the Adoption of Certified 
EHR technology.’’ 
Comment: Several commenters 
supported our proposal that if an EP has 
reassigned his or her payments for 
services to more than one employer or 
entity, that only one of those employers 
or entities should receive the EP’s EHR 
incentive payments for a particular EHR 
Reporting Period (75 FR 1910). The 
commenters do not believe that EPs 
should decide which employer or entity 
should receive his or her EHR incentive 
payment. Rather, the commenters stated 
that such payments should 
automatically be paid to the employer or 
entity that has received for the reporting 
period the largest percentage of the EP’s 
Medicare or Medicaid payments for 
services. 
Response: We are not persuaded to 
adopt the commenters’ suggestion. We 
believe that the suggestion by the 
commenters would create 
administrative complexities for both 
CMS and EPs with little benefit. Many 
of these obstacles would be similar to 
those described in the proposed rule 
when discussing the possibility of 
making proportional EHR incentive 
payments (75 FR 1911). Therefore, we 
are finalizing our proposal to revise 
§ 495.10(e) to preclude an EP from 
reassigning the incentive payment to 
more than one employer or entity. In 
cases where the EP is associated with 
more than one practice, EPs must select 
one TIN to receive any applicable EHR 
incentive payment. 
Comment: The commenters also state 
that if an EP has incurred out-of-pocket 
costs in connection with an EHR 
provided by an employer or other entity 
to which the EP has reassigned 
payments for his or her services, the EP 
should be permitted to keep an amount 
of his or her EHR incentives equal to the 
amount of such costs incurred. 
Response: The statute does not 
address this issue. It simply provides 
that the incentive payments are to be 
made directly to the EP or to an 
employer or other entity to which the 
EP has reassigned the incentive 
payment. Reassignment of the incentive 
payment must be consistent with 
applicable Medicare laws, rules, and 
regulations, including, without 
limitation, those related to fraud, waste, 
and abuse. We believe that any cost- 
sharing or subsequent distribution of the 
incentive payment, such as in the 
manner described by the commenter, 
should be resolved between the parties. 
Comment: Several commenters urged 
CMS to clarify that any reassignment of 
the EP’s EHR incentive payment should 
not constitute a financial arrangement 
within the meaning of the physician 
self-referral law, or remuneration within 
the meaning of the federal anti-kickback 
statute. 
Response: The physician self-referral 
law prohibits a physician from making 
a referral for designated health services 
to an entity with which the physician or 
a member of the physician’s immediate 
family has a financial relationship, 
unless an exception applies. For 
purposes of the physician self-referral 
law, a financial arrangement includes 
ownership or investment interests and 
compensation arrangements. The statute 
defines a ‘‘compensation arrangement’’ 
to mean any arrangement involving 
remuneration, direct or indirect, overt or 
covert, in cash or in kind. A 
reassignment of an EP’s EHR payment 
would constitute remuneration, and we 
note that reassignment generally occurs 
in the context of an existing 
compensation arrangement (for 
example, employment). There are many 
potentially applicable exceptions for 
compensation arrangements that involve 
a physician’s reassignment of Medicare 
payments.

Similarly, with respect to the anti- 
kickback statute, absent compliance 
with a safe harbor, a determination of 
whether a reassignment constitutes 
prohibited remuneration would be made 
on a case-by-case basis and we therefore 
decline to issue any statement regarding 
the application of the anti-kickback

Comment: One commenter 
representing American Indian and 
Alaska Native health providers urged 
CMS to require that the HITECH/EHR 
Meaningful Use provider incentive 
payments be reassigned to the Tribal 
outpatient clinics, because the Tribal 
clinics developed the infrastructure not 
the EPs themselves, and purchased 
electronic medical record systems to 
complement the current Registration 
Patient Management Systems (RPMS) of 
the Indian Health Service. In addition, 
the commenter noted that many tribal 
outpatient clinics have employment 
contracts with their EPs. Thus, the 
commenters urged CMS to require that 
incentive EHR payments should be 
included in employment contracts to 
help protect the EP as employee and the 
Tribe as the employer. 
Response: As stated above, section 
1848(o)(1)(A) of the Act provides that 
the EP’s incentive payment shall be paid 
to the eligible professional (or to an 
employer or other entity with which the 
physician has a valid contractual 
arrangement allowing the employer or 
other entity to bill for the physician’s 
services). We recognize that some tribes 
purchased EHR systems based upon 
criteria established by the Indian Health 
Service. However, after careful 
consideration, we believe that the same 
standards concerning the incentive 
payments should apply. The EP and the 
Tribal outpatient clinic should jointly 
resolve whether the EP’s EHR incentive 
payment will be reassigned to the Tribal 
outpatient clinic or made directly to the 
EP. Similarly, any decision by the Tribal 
outpatient clinic concerning whether to 
include language in its employment 
contract (or in the alternative, whether 
any pre-existing contract already 
requires reassignment of the payment), 
is a matter of contract interpretation that 
should be resolved by the parties 
themselves. This discussion is also 
addressed in the Medicaid section of 
this rule at II.D.4.a.3. 
Comment: One commenter expressed 
concern about the potential tax 
consequences associated with an EP’s 
reassignment of the EHR incentive 
payment by an independent contractor 
to a larger organization. The commenter 
recommended that a 1099 independent 
contractor should consult with his/her 
tax advisor before agreeing to reassign 
incentive payments and to ensure that 
the election to reassign is made before 
payment is sent from CMS or the State 
Medicaid Agency. 
Response: The commenter’s 
recommendation falls outside the scope 
of our authority. This is a matter for the 
1099 independent contractor EP to 
consider. 
Comment: Many national and state 
medical associations expressed concern 
regarding the proposed requirement that 
the EP must identify a Tax Identification 
Number (TIN) to which the EP’s 
incentive payment should be made. 
They assert that this will not work for 
physicians who do not have a TIN, and 
are enrolled in Medicare or Medicaid 
through their Social Security Number 
(SSN). Therefore, the commenters 
recommend that CMS accept the SSN in 
lieu of the TIN, so that all eligible 
physicians are able to participate in the 
Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive 
programs. 
Response: We recognize that many 
physicians are enrolled in Medicare or 
Medicaid through their Social Security 
Number (SSN). Therefore, we are 
revising our proposal at § 495.10 that an 
EP must submit, in a manner specified 
by CMS, the Taxpayer Identification 
Number (TIN) to which the EP’s 
incentive payment should be made. In 
finalized § 495.10(c), we provide that 
the TIN may be the EP’s Social Security 
Number (SSN) to which the EP’s 
incentive payment should be made. We 
note that if the physician is part of a 
group with more than one owner or 
organization that is incorporated, they 
would have a TIN for the corporation 
that is not the EP’s SSN. 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended that the employer or 
entity to which an EP reassigns payment 
for covered services, should be deemed 
authorized to provide, on the EP’s 
behalf, any documentation necessary for 
the EP to qualify for EHR incentive 
payments. 
Response: We believe that this should 
be resolved by the parties themselves. 
There is nothing in the statute that 
requires an EP’s employer or other 
entity to which an EP reassigns payment 
to provide any necessary documentation 
for an EP to qualify for EHR incentive 
payments. Rather, the finalized 
regulatory provision at § 495.8 provides 
that an EP must demonstrate that he or 
she satisfies each of the applicable 
objectives and associated measures 
under § 495.6. If the parties wish to have 
the necessary documentation furnished 
by the employer or entity, they should 
resolve this pursuant to an employment 
or contractual agreement. We are 
finalizing our proposal because we 
believe that making a single, 
consolidated payment would be the 
least administratively burdensome for 
both CMS and EPs. In addition, we 
believe a single, consolidated payment 
would reduce the possibility of fraud 
and duplicate payments. Several of 
these issues related to reassignment of 
payment are also addressed in the 
Medicaid section. See II.D.3.e. 
e. Payment Adjustment Effective in CY 
2015 and Subsequent Years for EPs Who 
Are Not Meaningful Users of Certified 
EHR Technology 
Section 1848(a)(7) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4101(b) of the 
HITECH Act, provides for payment 
adjustments effective for CY 2015 and 
subsequent years for EPs who are not 
meaningful EHR users during the 
relevant EHR reporting period for the 
year. In general, beginning in 2015, if an 
EP is not a meaningful EHR user for any 
EHR reporting period for the year, then 
the Medicare physician fee schedule 
amount for covered professional 
services furnished by the EP during the 
year (including the fee schedule amount 
for purposes of determining a payment 
based on the fee schedule amount) is 
adjusted to equal the ‘‘applicable 
percent’’ of the fee schedule amount 
(defined below) that would otherwise 
apply. The HITECH Act includes a 
significant hardship exception, 
discussed below, which, if applicable, 
could exempt certain EPs from this 
payment adjustment. The payment 
adjustments do not apply to hospital- 
based EPs. 
The term ‘‘applicable percent’’ means: 
‘‘(I) for 2015, 99 percent (or, in the case 
of an EP who was subject to the 
application of the payment adjustment 
if the EP is not a successful electronic 
prescriber under section 1848(a)(5) for 
2014, 98 percent); (II) for 2016, 98 
percent; and (III) for 2017 and each 
subsequent year, 97 percent.’’ 
In addition, section 1848(a)(7)(iii) of 
the Act provides that if for 2018 and 
subsequent years the Secretary finds 
that the proportion of EPs who are 
meaningful EHR users is less than 75 
percent, the applicable percent shall be 
decreased by 1 percentage point from 
the applicable percent in the preceding 
year, but in no case shall the applicable 
percent be less than 95 percent. 
Significant Hardship Exception— 
section 1848(a)(7)(B) of the Act provides 
that the Secretary may, on a case-by- 
case basis, exempt an EP who is not a 
meaningful EHR user for the year from

adjustment if the Secretary determines 
that compliance with the requirements 
for being a meaningful EHR user would 
result in a significant hardship, such as 
in the case of an EP who practices in a 
rural area without sufficient Internet 
access. The exemption is subject to 
annual renewal, but in no case may an 
EP be granted a hardship exemption for 
more than 5 years. 
Comment: Some commenters believed 
that when an EP’s performance leads to 
a negative financial impact under 
Medicare payment policy, it would be 
unfair and overly punitive for them to 
face a separate and potentially more 
significant financial impact—whether 
through a denial of funding and/or 
ARRA’s penalties. Further, some 
commenters indicated that they 
interpreted these requirements to mean 
that Medicaid participants would or 
would not experience fee-schedule 
adjustments if they are not meaningful 
users by the end of 2014. 
Response: We will reduce payments 
as specified under the statute. Under 
sections 4101(b) and (c) of the HITECH 
Act, we are required to pay EPs less 
than 100 percent of the fee schedule and 
to make downward adjustments to MA- 
affiliated EPs for their professional 
services if they are not meaningful users 
of certified EHR beginning in CY 2015. 
Under sections 4102(a), (a)(2), and (c) of 
the HITECH Act, we are authorized to 
pay eligible hospitals a reduced annual 
payment update, provide downward 
payment adjustment to CAHs for cost 
reporting periods, and provide 
downward payment adjustment to MA- 
affiliated hospitals respectively, if they 
are not meaningful users of certified 
EHR technology beginning in FY 2015. 
The Medicare fee schedule adjustments 
will impact any EP or subsection(d) 
hospital that is not a meaningful user by 
the end of 2014. The adjustments are 
not authorized under Medicaid, but the 
adjustments will still apply to Medicaid 
EPs who are also Medicare EPs and also 
to Medicaid acute care hospitals that are 
also subsection(d) hospitals. We are 
finalizing these provisions as proposed. 
2. Incentive Payments for Hospitals 
a. Definition of Eligible Hospital for 
Medicare 
Section 1886(n) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4102(a)(1) of the 
HITECH Act, provides for incentive 
payments, beginning in FY 2011 (that is, 
October 1, 2010 through September 30, 
2011) for eligible hospitals that are 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology during the EHR reporting 
period for the payment year. In the 
proposed rule, we proposed a new 
§ 495.104 to implement this provision. 
As we noted in the proposed rule, 
section 1886(n)(6)(B) of the Act defines 
‘‘eligible hospitals’’ for purposes of the 
incentive payments provision, as 
‘‘subsection (d) hospitals,’’ referring to 
the definition of that term in section 
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act. Section 
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act generally 
defines a ‘‘subsection (d) hospital’’ as a 
‘‘hospital located in one of the fifty 
States or the District of Columbia.’’ The 
term therefore does not include 
hospitals located in the territories or 
hospitals located in Puerto Rico. Section 
1886(d)(9)(A) of the Act separately 
defines a ‘‘subsection (d) Puerto Rico 
hospital’’ as a hospital that is located in 
Puerto Rico and that ‘‘would be a 
subsection (d) hospital if it were located 
in one of the 50 states.’’ Therefore, 
because section 4102(a)(1) of the 
HITECH Act does not refer to 
‘‘subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospitals,’’ 
we proposed that incentive payments 
for meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology would not available under 
this provision to hospitals located in 
Puerto Rico. The provision does apply 
to inpatient, acute care hospitals located 
in the State of Maryland. These 
hospitals are not currently paid under 
the IPPS in accordance with a special 
waiver provided by section 1814(b)(3) of 
the Act. Despite this waiver, the 
Maryland hospitals continue to meet the 
definition of a ‘‘subsection (d) hospital’’ 
because they are hospitals located in the 
50 states. Therefore we proposed that 
incentive payments for meaningful 
users of certified EHR technology would 
be available under this provision to 
acute care hospitals located in the State 
of Maryland. The statutory definition of 
a subsection (d) hospital also does not 
apply to hospitals and hospital units 
excluded from the IPPS under section 
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, such as 
psychiatric, rehabilitation, long term 
care, children’s, and cancer hospitals. 
We also proposed that, for purposes of 
this provision, we would provide 
incentive payments to hospitals as they 
are distinguished by provider number in 
hospital cost reports. We proposed that 
incentive payments for eligible hospitals 
would be calculated based on the 
provider number used for cost reporting 
purposes, which is the CMS 
Certification Number (CCN) of the main 
provider (also referred to as OSCAR 
number). Payments to eligible hospitals 
are made to each provider of record. The 
criteria for being a meaningful EHR 
user, and the manner for demonstrating 
meaningful use, are discussed in section 
B.2. of this final rule. 
Comment: We received numerous 
comments on our proposal to identify 
all individual hospitals eligible for 
incentive payments based on the 
provider number used for cost reporting 
purposes (the CCN of the main 
provider). These commenters, including 
national and regional hospital 
associations, hospital systems, and 
hospitals with multiple campuses, 
objected to the proposed policy on 
various grounds. Many of these 
commenters pointed out that there is no 
standard policy that defines the specific 
types of facilities to which a single CCN 
applies. As a result, a single CCN could 
encompass multiple hospitals within a 
hospital system in some cases, while in 
other cases multiple hospitals within a 
system could have separate CCNs. These 
commenters therefore maintained that 
our proposed policy would unjustifiably 
lead to disparate treatment of hospital 
systems based solely on whether the 
system had one or more provider 
numbers. Commenters also maintained 
that, because the Medicare and 
Medicaid payment incentives are 
calculated using a per-hospital base 
amount, plus a capped per-discharge 
amount per hospital, identifying 
individual hospitals solely by CCN 
would result in distributing payments in 
a manner that does not foster 
widespread EHR adoption and use. The 
for this argument regarding limited EHR 
adoption and use is that multi-campus 
systems with a single CCN would 
receive only one base payment, and 
would be more likely to reach the 
discharge cap. Some commenters also 
argued that linking incentive payments 
only to a single CCN would not 
accurately reflect the pattern of costs 
required for deploying EHR systems 
across all sites in a hospital system. For 
example, even hospital sites that are 
part of the same system often require 
significant variations in their EHR 
systems, accommodating local policies 
and processes, as well as different 
legacy systems, physician preferences, 
clinical protocols, and other variables. 
Some commenters cited as a precedent 
our policy with regard to hospitals with 
one CCN, but multiple sites spanning 
more than one wage index region. CMS 
has instructed such hospitals to report 
wage data for each site separately on the 
cost report, and pays for discharges 
under the wage index that applies 
where the service is provided, that is, 
under a different wage index for each 
site. 
These commenters recommended 
various approaches to recognizing and 
verifying the status of separate hospitals 
under one CCN number. Many of them

 44449 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
recommended that we adopt a ‘‘multi- 
pronged approach that allows a 
‘‘hospital’’ to be defined in ways that 
acknowledge the varied organizational 
structures of multi-hospital systems, 
including by a distinct CCN, a distinct 
emergency department, or a distinct 
hospital license.’’ Commenters 
recommended that we indentify and 
verify the distinct hospitals within 
hospital systems either by revising the 
cost report or by developing an 
attestation process similar to the process 
employed under § 413.65 of the 
regulations to verify provider-based 
status. Commenters also recommended 
that we either collect the data necessary 
for determining payment amounts (for 
example, discharge counts) directly 
from each hospital within a system with 
a single provider number, or develop a 
method of allocating discharges, bed 
days, and other relevant data among the 
hospital campuses represented in a 
hospital cost report under a single CCN. 
Finally, a number of the commenters 
advocating a different approach 
contended that our proposed policy ran 
counter to the intent of the EHR 
incentive provision, which is to 
promote broader adoption of EHR 
systems. These commenters argued in 
various ways that recognizing each 
campus of a multi-campus hospital for 
separate payment was most consistent 
with the statute because it would 
provide a greater overall level of 
funding for EHR efforts, especially to 
hospital systems that have elected to 
enroll multiple campuses under a single 
Medicare provider agreement, and thus 
support diffusion of EHR systems more 
broadly. One of these commenters did, 
however, acknowledge that ‘‘in most 
circumstances the term ‘subsection(d) 
hospital’ under the Medicare Program 
includes all of a hospital system’s 
inpatient facilities that operate under a 
single provider number,’’ before going 
on to argue that CMS has both the 
authority and the obligation under the 
HITECH Act to diffuse EHR incentive 
payment more broadly by treating each 
facility under a hospital system as a 
separate hospital, regardless of whether 
any of the facilities share a single 
provider number. 
Response: We appreciate the 
commenters’ concerns, but we continue 
to believe that our proposal represents 
the best policy approach in determining 
what constitutes an ‘‘eligible hospital.’’ 
In the absence of clear direction from 
the statute to the contrary, we believe 
that the most appropriate policy is to 
interpret the terms in subsection (d) 
‘‘acute care hospital’’ and ‘‘children’s 
hospital’’ in the light of existing 
Medicare and Medicaid program 
policies and precedents. It is quite true, 
as a number of the commenters noted, 
that hospital systems have considerable 
latitude (although not unlimited) in 
choosing whether to obtain one CCN for 
all their facilities, or to obtain separate 
CCNs for some or all of their facilities. 
However, once a hospital has sought 
and obtained a single CCN for two or 
more facilities, that hospital has chosen 
to represent itself to CMS as a single 
hospital, including for purposes of 
payment, cost reporting, and satisfying 
the conditions of participation. Such 
systems submit unified cost reports 
integrating data (including charges, 
discharges, bed days, and other relevant 
data) from every facility under the 
single CCN. For purposes of DSH and 
IME payments under the IPPS, both 
eligibility for payment and the 
applicable payment amounts are 
determined on the basis of this 
integrated data. Most significantly, the 
Medicare conditions of participation 
require that a system with a single CCN 
establish and maintain a single 
governing structure, medical staff, 
nursing staff, and record services. 
Section 482.2 states that a ‘‘hospital 
must have an organized medical staff 
that operates under by-laws approved 
by the governing body.’’ Section 
482.21(e) states that the governing body 
must ensure, among other matters, that 
‘‘the hospital-wide quality assessment 
and performance improvement efforts 
address priorities for improved quality 
of care.’’ In addition, § 482.24 states that 
the hospital must have ‘‘a medical 
record service that has administrative 
for medical records.’’. For these reasons, 
we believe that recognition of the 
decision made by each hospital or 
hospital to represent and organize itself 
as a single entity under one CCN, or as 
two or more distinct entities under 
separate CCNs is a strength, rather than 
a weakness, of our proposed policy. 
Each institution that has exercised 
available latitude to obtain one CCN for 
all their facilities not only represents 
itself as a single hospital, but also agrees 
to conduct itself in significant ways as 
a single hospital. 
We also do not agree with those 
commenters who argue that our policy 
of applying different wage indexes to 
the campuses comprising a hospital 
system operating under a single CCN 
warrants our treating each campus as a 
separate eligible hospital for purposes of 
the EHR incentive payment program. 
Our policy for these few cases when a 
multi-campus hospital spans two or 
more wage index areas does not amount 
to recognizing that each campus is a 
separate hospital for payment purposes, 
but rather to accounting for the fact that, 
in these few cases, one hospital is 
located in two wage index areas. In 
these cases, it is appropriate to pay, and 
to account for wages, on the basis of 
where each discharge occurs rather than 
on the basis of where, for example, the 
main campus of a hospital may be 
located. 
With regard to the disparate treatment 
argument advanced by a number of 
commenters, we acknowledge that, 
under our proposed policy, a single 
hospital system with two campuses will 
receive (all other things being equal) 
lower incentive payments than the 
combined incentive payments of two- 
single-campus hospitals with the same 
number of discharges. However, an 
equivalent disparate treatment situation 
would arise under the policy advocated 
by these commenters. Under the policy 
of recognizing each campus of a multi- 
campus system as a separate hospital, a 
single-campus hospital would received 
lower incentive payments than a multi- 
campus hospital with the same number 
of discharges, despite the fact that both 
hospitals have a single CCN and are 
recognized for administrative and 
financial purposes, and for purposes of 
the conditions of participation, as a 
single hospital. 
Example: Hospital A is a multicampus 
hospital with 30,000 discharges and a 
Medicare share of 50 percent. Hospital 
A’s discharges are evenly split between 
its two campuses. Hospital B is a single 
campus hospital with 30,000 discharges 
and a Medicare share of 50 percent. 
During the first year of the transition, 
each campus of Hospital A would 
receive a separate incentive payment 
determined on the following manner: 
($2,000,000 base amount + [(15,000 ¥ 
1,149) × $200] discharge-related 
amount) × .5 Medicare share × 1.0 
transition factor = ($2,000,000 + 
$2,770,200) × .5 × 1.0 = $2,385,100 
Hospital A’s total payment would 
therefore be $4,770,200. In contrast, 
Hospital B would receive a single 
payment determined in the following 
manner: 
($2,000,000 base amount + [(23,000 ¥ 
1,149) × $200] discharge-related 
amount) × .5 Medicare share × 1.0 
transition factor = ($2,000,000 + 
$4,370,200) × .5 × 1.0 = $3,185,100 
Hospital B would thus receive a 
payment that is $1,585,100 smaller than 
Hospital A’s total payment for the same 
number of discharges. 
The change in policy recommended 
by these commenters will therefore 
replace one equity issue with another. 
We see no reason to privilege one of 
these arguments over the other, and

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
therefore we believe that the decision on 
a final policy ought to turn on the other 
considerations that we discuss. 
Finally, we cannot agree with the 
commenters that determining the 
appropriate policy on this question 
should turn on which alternative 
produces the greatest overall level of 
spending on EHR systems. Many 
decisions could result in lower potential 
payments to some or all potential 
meaningful users of EHR payments. 
Congress deliberately chose to limit 
incentive payments based on the 
statutory formula (using the current 
statutory and regulatory definition of 
‘‘subsection (d) hospital’’), and further 
limited the amount of incentive 
payments available to large hospitals by 
not increasing incentive payments 
above 23,000 discharges. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
our policy as proposed. For purposes of 
this provision, we will provide 
incentive payments to hospitals as they 
are distinguished by provider number in 
hospital cost reports. Incentive 
payments for eligible hospitals will be 
calculated based on the provider 
number used for cost reporting 
purposes, which is the CMS 
Certification Number (CCN) of the main 
provider (also referred to as OSCAR 
number). Payments to eligible hospitals 
will be made to each provider of record. 
b. Incentive Payment Calculation for 
Eligible Hospitals: Initial Amount 
Section 1886(n)(2) of the Act, as 
amended by 4102(a) of the HITECH Act, 
describes the methodology for 
determining the incentive payment 
amount for eligible hospitals that are 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology during the EHR reporting 
period for a payment year. In general, 
that section requires the incentive 
payment for each payment year to be 
calculated as the product of: (1) An 
initial amount; (2) the Medicare share; 
and (3) a transition factor applicable to 
that payment year. 
As amended by section 4201(a) of the 
HITECH Act, section 1886(n)(2)(A)(i) of 
the Act defines the initial amount as the 
sum of a ‘‘base amount,’’ as defined in 
section 1886(n)(2)(B) of the Act, and a 
‘‘discharge related amount,’’ as defined 
in section 1886(n)(2)(C) of the Act. The 
base amount is $2,000,000, as defined in 
section 1886(n)(2)(B) of the Act. The 
term ‘‘discharge related amount’’ is 
defined in section 1886(n)(2)(C) of the 
Act as ‘‘the sum of the amount, 
estimated based upon total discharges 
for the eligible hospital (regardless of 
any source of payment) for the period, 
for each discharge up to the 23,000th 
discharge as follows: 
(i) for the first through the 1,149th 
discharge, $0. 
(ii) for the 1,150th through the 23,000th 
discharge, $200. 
(iii) for any discharge greater than the 
23,000th, $0.’’ 
In addition to the base amount, the 
discharge related amount provides an 
additional $200 for each hospital 
discharge during a payment year, 
beginning with a hospital’s 1,150th 
discharge of the payment year, and 
ending with a hospital’s 23,000th 
discharge of the payment year. No 
additional payment is made for 
discharges prior to the 1,150th 
discharge, or for those discharges 
subsequent to the 23,000th discharge. 
We proposed to implement the ‘‘initial 
amount’’ within the formula as that term 
is defined in the statute. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that we identify the sources of 
the discharge data we plan to employ 
for purposes of determining the 
discharge related amount. These 
commenters also requested confirmation 
of their understanding that no type of 
discharge, regardless of source of 
payment, would be excluded from the 
discharge count for this purpose. 
Commenters specifically cited nursery 
discharges and discharges from non-PPS 
areas of a hospital as examples of 
discharges that should not be excluded 
under the statutory language, which 
they believe requires the inclusion of all 
patient discharges regardless of type of 
patient within the inpatient areas of the 
hospital. 
Response: We cannot agree with the 
commenters that the statutory language 
includes all patient discharges within 
the inpatient areas of the hospital. 
Rather, the statutory language clearly 
restricts the discharges to be counted for 
purposes of determining the discharge- 
related amount to discharges from the 
acute care portion of the hospital. As we 
discussed in the proposed rule, the term 
‘‘discharge related amount’’ is defined in 
section 1886(n)(2)(C) of the Act as ‘‘the 
sum of the amount, estimated based 
upon total discharges for the eligible 
hospital (regardless of any source of 
payment) for the period, for each 
discharge up to the 23,000th discharge 
as follows: 
(i) for the first through the 1,149th 
discharge, $0. 
(ii) for the 1,150th through the 23,000th 
discharge, $200. 
(iii) for any discharge greater than the 
23,000th, $0.’’ 
The phrase ‘‘total discharges for the 
eligible hospital (regardless of any 
source of payment)’’ limits the count of 
discharges to the acute care inpatient 
discharges. This is because of the 
reference to ‘‘eligible hospital.’’ ‘‘Eligible 
hospital’’ is defined in section 
1886(n)(6)(B) of the Act for purposes of 
the incentive payments provision, as ‘‘a 
subsection (d) hospital,’’ referring in 
turn to the definition of that term in 
section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act. Section 
1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act generally 
defines a ‘‘subsection (d) hospital’’ as a 
‘‘hospital located in one of the fifty 
States or the District of Columbia,’’ 
excluding hospitals that are not paid 
under the IPPS in accordance with 
section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, such as 
psychiatric, rehabilitation, long term 
care, children’s, and cancer hospitals. 
However, 1886(d)(1)(B) also specifies 
that the ‘‘term ‘subsection (d) hospital 
* * * does not include a psychiatric or 
rehabilitation unit of the hospital which 
is a distinct part of the hospital (as 
defined by the Secretary).’’ Therefore, 
the term ‘‘eligible hospital’’ for purposes 
of the incentive payments provision 
does not extend to the excluded units of 
the hospital. The term does, of course, 
include the inpatient portion of the 
hospital that receives payment for 
Medicare purposes under the inpatient 
PPS. The phrase ‘‘regardless of any 
source of payment,’’ however, indicates 
that the count of ‘‘total discharges’’ for 
this purpose should include not only 
patients for whom Medicare is the 
source of payment, but also patients for 
whom payment is received from 
Medicaid or any other source of 
payment. Accordingly, in the revised 
cost report form that is currently 
pending and which will be finalized in 
time for the 2011 payment year, CMS 
Form 2552–10, Hospital and Hospital 
Health Care Complex Cost Report, we 
have included a cell for entry of ‘‘Total 
hospital discharges as defined in section 
4102 of AARA,’’ in the new Worksheet 
E–1, Part II, ‘‘Calculation of 
Reimbursement for Settlement for HIT.’’ 
This new cell is derived from line 14, 
from ‘‘Worksheet S–3, Part I column 15.’’ 
In turn, this cell from Worksheet 
S–3, Part I, column 15 incorporate all 
discharges from the inpatient, acute care 
portion of the hospital, regardless of 
payment source. In this final rule, we 
have also revised the definition of 
‘‘eligible hospital’’ in § 495.100 of the 
regulations, as well as the specification 
of ‘‘initial amount’’ in § 495.104(c)(3) of 
the regulations, in order to clarify this 
point. 
Section 1886(n)(2)(C) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4102(a) of the 
HITECH Act, specifies that a ‘‘12-month 
period selected by the Secretary’’ may be

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
employed for purposes of determining 
the discharge related amount. While the 
statute specifies that the payment year 
is determined based on a Federal fiscal 
year (FY), section 1886(n)(2)(C) of the 
Act provides the Secretary with 
authority to determine the discharge 
related amount on the basis of discharge 
data from a relevant hospital cost 
reporting period, for use in determining 
the incentive payment during a FY. FYs 
begin on October 1 of each calendar 
year, and end on September 30 of the 
subsequent calendar year. Hospital cost 
reporting periods can begin with any 
month of a calendar year, and end on 
the last day of the 12th subsequent 
month. We proposed, for purposes of 
administrative simplicity and 
timeliness, for each eligible hospital 
during each incentive payment year, to 
use data on the hospital discharges from 
the hospital fiscal year that ends during 
the FY that is prior to the FY that serves 
as the payment year as the basis for 
making preliminary incentive payments. 
Similarly, we proposed that final 
payments would be determined at the 
time of settling the cost report for the 
hospital fiscal year that ends during the 
payment year, and settled on the basis 
of the hospital discharge data from that 
cost reporting period. 
Example of proposal: FY 2011 begins 
on October 1, 2010 and ends on 
September 30, 2011. For an eligible 
hospital with a cost reporting period 
running from July 1, 2009 through June 
30, 2010, we would employ the relevant 
data from the hospital’s cost reporting 
period ending June 30, 2010 in order to 
determine the incentive payment for the 
hospital during FY 2011. This timeline 
would allow us to have the relevant data 
available for determining payments in a 
timely manner for the first and 
subsequent payment years. This 
timeline would also render it 
unnecessary to develop a cumbersome 
process to extract and employ discharge 
data across more than one hospital cost 
reporting period in order to determine 
the discharge related amount for a FY- 
based payment period. However, final 
payments would be based on hospital 
discharge data from the cost report 
ending June 30, 2011, and determined at 
the time of settlement for that cost 
reporting period. 
Commenters raised several issues 
with regard to our proposals regarding 
the timing of the cost reports to be used 
for purposes of determining preliminary 
and final incentive payments. Each of 
these issues embraces the use of several 
data elements, including discharge 
counts, bed days, and other factors 
employed in the payment calculations. 
For purposes of simplicity, we will 
address these issues in general terms in 
this section. As we will note at several 
junctures below, this discussions of 
these issues, however, are applicable to 
the cost report data for other elements 
of the computation. 
Comment: Several commenters called 
our attention to timing issues with 
regard to the cost reporting periods that 
we proposed to use for purposes of 
determining preliminary and final 
incentive payments. These commenters 
noted that, if we finalize our proposal to 
use data from the hospital fiscal year 
that ends during the FY prior to the FY 
that serves as the payment year as the 
basis for making preliminary incentive 
payments, hospitals with cost reporting 
periods on the October-to-September 
cycle would face a delay of two months 
or longer after potentially qualifying as 
a meaningful user before receiving a 
preliminary incentive payment. 
Specifically, for hospitals on this cycle, 
the cost report that would be used for 
determining interim payments for the 
first payment year (the October 1, 2009 
through September 30, 2010 cost report) 
would not be due until February 28, 
2011, two months after the hospital may 
have been able to qualify as a 
meaningful user (January 1, 2011). For 
hospitals on the September-to-August 
cycle, the delay could be one month. 
The commenters pointed out that over 
one-fifth of subsection (d) hospitals 
have cost reporting periods beginning 
on September 1 or October 1. The 
commenters therefore recommended 
that we employ discharge and other data 
from a hospital’s most recently filed cost 
report as the basis for determining the 
hospital’s preliminary incentive 
payment once the hospital has qualified 
as a meaningful user. 
Response: We agree with these 
commenters, and in this final rule we 
are therefore adopting the policy that we 
employ discharge and other data from a 
hospital’s most recently filed 12-month 
(see discussion below) cost report as the 
basis for determining the hospital’s 
preliminary incentive payment once the 
hospital has qualified as a meaningful 
user. However, the precise timing of 
payments, especially during the first 
payment year, may be affected by other 
factors such as the timeline for 
implementing the requisite systems to 
calculate and disburse the payments. 
We are adopting the policy 
recommended by the commenters in 
order to avoid any unnecessary delays 
in making interim payments due merely 
to the timing of cost reporting periods. 
Example: FY 2011 begins on October 
1, 2010 and ends on September 30, 
2011. For an eligible hospital with a cost 
reporting period on the October-to- 
September cycle, we would employ the 
relevant data from the hospital’s most 
recently submitted cost reporting period 
in order to determine the incentive 
payment for the hospital during FY 
2011. If the hospital qualifies for 
incentive payments on January 1, 2011, 
this would probably be the cost report 
for the period running from October 1, 
2008 through September 30, 2009. 
However, we would also employ the 
October 1, 2009 through September 30, 
2010 cost report, if that cost report is 
submitted before the point when 
preliminary incentive payments can be 
calculated. 
Comment: A number of commenters 
also raised concerns about our proposal 
to determine final incentive payments at 
the time of settling the cost report for 
the hospital fiscal year that ends during 
the payment year, and to be settled on 
the basis of the hospital discharge and 
other data from that cost reporting 
period. These commenters pointed out 
that the pending CMS Form 2552–10 
will not be effective in time for all 
hospitals and CAHs to complete the 
new S–10 worksheet, Hospital 
Uncompensated Care and Indigent Care 
Data, reporting charity care for their cost 
reporting period ending during the 
payment year. The effective date of the 
new cost report will be for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
May 1, 2010 (as opposed to February 1, 
2010 date anticipated in the proposed 
rule). For purposes of our proposal for 
determining final incentive payments, 
including the Medicare share/charity 
calculation, the first cost reporting 
period for which the new cost report 
will be available is the period running 
from May 1, 2010 through April 30, 
2011. This means that, for cost reporting 
periods ending in FY 2011 before April 
30, hospitals will not be able to 
complete the new S–10 worksheet to 
report charity care charges. Therefore, 
these commenters recommended that 
we revise our proposed policy, so that 
final incentive payments will be 
determined at the time of settlement for 
the cost reporting period beginning in 
the payment year. In this way all 
hospitals, regardless of their cost 
reporting cycle, will have adequate time 
to submit the revised cost reports in 
time for determining final incentive 
payments. 
Response: We agree with these 
commenters, and in this final rule we 
are therefore adopting the policy that we 
determine final incentive payments at 
the time of settling the 12-month (see 
discussion below) cost report for the 
hospital fiscal year that begins after the 
beginning of the payment year, and to 
be settled on the basis of the hospital

discharge and other data from that cost 
reporting period. 
Example: FY 2011 begins on October 
1, 2010 and ends on September 30, 
2011. For an eligible hospital with a cost 
reporting period running from July 1 
through June 30, we would employ the 
relevant data from the hospital’s cost 
reporting period ending June 30, 2009 in 
order to determine the preliminary 
incentive payment for the hospital 
during FY 2011 (or June 30, 2010, if that 
cost report was filed prior to the 
calculation). However, final payments 
would be based on hospital discharge 
data from the cost report beginning on 
July 1, 2011 and ending June 30, 2012, 
and determined at the time of settlement 
for that cost reporting period. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that we explain how the 
occurrence of non-standard cost 
reporting periods will be taken into 
account in determining the appropriate 
cost reporting periods to employ for 
determining preliminary and final EHR 
incentive payments. Non-standard cost 
reporting periods run for periods shorter 
than the standard 12-month cost 
reporting periods (for example, 3 
months, 6 months), and are typically 
employed to accommodate the 
circumstances of hospitals in several 
distinct situations, such as newly 
constructed hospitals, changes of 
ownership, and reorganization of a 
single multicampus hospital into 
multiple separate providers. In these 
cases, one non-standard cost reporting 
period may be employed before the 
hospital resumes (or begins) cost 
reporting on a 12-month cycle. One 
commenter recommended that we 
account for these situations by adopting 
three changes to our proposed 
regulations: 
• For purposes of determining 
preliminary incentive payments, 
employ the most recently submitted 12- 
month cost reporting period that ends in 
the year prior to the payment year, in 
order to account for those situations in 
which the most recent cost reporting 
period ending prior to the payment year 
is a non-standard period. 
• For purposes of determining final 
incentive payments, employ the first 12- 
month cost reporting period that begins 
after the start of the payment year, in 
order to account for those situations in 
which the cost reporting period ending 
during the payment year is a non- 
standard period. 
• Provide that a hospital may address 
the CMS regional office responsible for 
its payment area for determination of 
the appropriate cost reporting period to 
employ for calculating preliminary or 
final incentive payment in cases that are 
not anticipated by the rules adopted in 
the final regulation. 
Response: We acknowledge that we 
failed to address the circumstances of 
non-standard cost reporting periods in 
the proposed rule, and we agree with 
the commenters that it is only 
appropriate to do so. Non-standard cost 
reporting periods are not likely to be 
truly representative of a hospital’s 
experience, even if methods were to be 
adopted for extrapolating data over a 
normal 12-month cost reporting period. 
This is because these periods are often 
quite short (for example, 3 months), 
which makes it questionable to 
extrapolate the data over a full cost 
reporting period. In addition, these 
abbreviated periods often capture the 
experience of a hospital during a period 
of transition (for example, change of 
ownership), which often renders the 
data highly unrepresentative. We also 
agree with the logic of the policy 
revisions proposed by the commenter 
cited above, subject only to the 
necessity of adapting the 
recommendations slightly to the 
revisions, as discussed above, we are 
also adopting to our proposals for 
identifying the cost reporting periods to 
be employed in determining 
preliminary and final EHR incentive 
payments. 
After consideration of the public 
comments we receive with regard to the 
use of cost reporting periods for 
preliminary and final incentive payment 
determinations, we are adopting the 
following policies in this final rule. 
• For purposes of determining 
preliminary incentive payments, we 
will employ discharge and other 
relevant data from a hospital’s most 
recently submitted 12-month cost report 
once the hospital has qualified as a 
meaningful user. 
• For purposes of determining final 
incentive payments, we will employ the 
first 12-month cost reporting period that 
begins after the start of the payment 
year, in order to settle payments on the 
basis of the hospital discharge and other 
data from that cost reporting period. In 
this final rule, we are revising section 
495.104(c)(2) of the regulations 
accordingly. We are not adopting the 
recommendation to allow the CMS 
regional offices to make a determination 
about the appropriate cost reporting 
period in situations not anticipated by 
these rules because we believe that 
these two rules cover all possible 
situations. For example, even in 
complicated cases involving non- 
standard cost reporting periods, the cost 
reporting period for a hospital adjusts to 
a standard 12-month cycle within a brief 
period. 
c. Incentive Payment Calculation for 
Eligible Hospitals: Medicare Share 
As previously discussed, the initial 
amount must be multiplied by the 
eligible hospital’s Medicare share and 
an applicable transition factor to 
determine the incentive payment to an 
eligible hospital for a payment year. As 
added by section 4102(a) of the HITECH 
Act, section 1886(n)(2)(D) of the Act 
defines the Medicare share for purposes 
of calculating incentive payments as a 
fraction based on estimated Medicare 
FFS and managed care inpatient bed 
days, divided by estimated total 
inpatient bed-days, modified by charges 
for charity care. This section specifies 
that the Medicare share fraction is 
determined for the incentive payment 
year ‘‘for an eligible hospital for a period 
selected by the Secretary.’’ As in the 
case of the discharge data discussed 
above, this clause provides the Secretary 
with authority to determine the eligible 
hospital’s Medicare share fraction on 
the basis of data from a relevant hospital 
cost reporting period, for use in 
determining the incentive payment 
during a FY. For purposes of 
administrative simplicity and timeliness 
equivalent to those discussed above 
with regard to discharge data, we 
proposed, for each eligible hospital 
during each payment year, to employ 
data on the hospital’s Medicare fee-for- 
service and managed care inpatient bed 
days, total inpatient bed-days, and 
charges for charity care from the 
hospital FY that ends during the FY 
prior to the FY that serves as the 
payment year as the basis for 
preliminary payment. We also proposed 
that final payment would be made on 
the basis of the data from the hospital 
fiscal year that ends during the FY that 
serves as the payment year at the time 
of the settlement of the cost report for 
the latter period. 
As a result of the changes we are 
making to these proposed policies in 
response to the comments discussed in 
the previous section, in this final rule 
we are adopting the following policies 
for employing data on the eligible 
hospital’s Medicare fee-for-service and 
managed care inpatient bed days, total 
inpatient bed-days, and charges for 
charity care from the hospital in making 
preliminary and final EHR incentive 
payment determinations: 
• For purposes of determining 
preliminary incentive payments, we 
will employ data on the hospital’s 
Medicare fee-for-service and managed 
care inpatient bed days, total inpatient 
bed-days, and charges for charity care 
from a hospital’s most recently 
submitted 12-month cost report once the

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
hospital has qualified as a meaningful 
user. 
• For purposes of determining final 
incentive payments, we will employ the 
first 12-month cost reporting period that 
begins after the start of the payment 
year, in order to settle payments on the 
basis of the hospital’s Medicare fee-for- 
service and managed care inpatient bed 
days, total inpatient bed-days, and 
charges for charity care data from that 
cost reporting period. 
Section 1886(n)(2)(D) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4102 of the HITECH 
Act, defines the numerator and 
denominator of the Medicare share 
fraction for an eligible hospital in terms 
of estimated Medicare FFS and managed 
care inpatient bed-days, estimated total 
inpatient bed-days, and charges for 
charity care. Specifically, section 
1886(n)(2)(D)(i) of the Act defines the 
numerator of the Medicare share 
fraction as the sum of— 
• The estimated number of inpatient- 
bed-days (as established by the 
Secretary) which are attributable to 
individuals with respect to whom 
payment may be made under part A; 
and 
• The estimated number of inpatient- 
bed-days (as so established) that are 
attributable to individuals who are 
enrolled with a MA organization under 
Part C. 
We proposed to determine the 
numbers of Medicare Part A and Part C 
inpatient-bed-days using the same data 
sources and methods for counting those 
days that we employ in determining 
Medicare’s share for purposes of making 
payments for direct graduate medical 
education costs, as provided under 
section 1886(h) of the Act and § 413.75 
of our regulations. Specifically, we 
proposed to derive ‘‘the estimated 
number of inpatient-bed-days * * * 
attributable to individuals with respect 
to whom payment may be made under 
part A’’ from lines 1, 6 through 9, 10, 
and 14 in column 4 on Worksheet S–3, 
Part I of CMS Form 2552–96, Hospital 
and Hospital Health Care Complex Cost 
Report. We stated that the data entered 
on these lines in the cost report include 
all patient days attributable to Medicare 
inpatients, excluding those in units not 
paid under the IPPS and excluding 
nursery days. 
Comment: A number of commenters 
pointed out an apparent contradiction 
between the cost report sources from 
which we proposed to derive the ‘‘the 
estimated number of inpatient-bed-days 
* * * attributable to individuals with 
respect to whom payment may be made 
under part A’’ (lines 1, 6 through 9, 10, 
and 14 in column 4 on Worksheet S–3, 
Part I of CMS Form 2552–96,), and our 
statement that ‘‘the data entered on these 
lines in the cost report include all 
patient days attributable to Medicare 
inpatients, excluding those in units not 
paid under the IPPS and excluding 
nursery days.’’ These commenters 
supported our proposal to employ the 
data from those lines of the cost report, 
on the grounds that these cost report 
lines ‘‘adequately capture the necessary 
data.’’ However, as the commenters 
pointed out, the data on the identified 
lines do include patient days in units 
not paid under the inpatient PPS. These 
commenters also contended that the 
relevant statutory language (‘‘inpatient- 
bed-days * * * attributable to 
individuals with respect to whom 
payment may be made under part A’’; 
emphasis supplied) would seem to 
include patient days in units not paid 
under the inpatient PPS. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that our citation of the 
specific cost report sources from which 
we proposed to derive ‘‘the estimated 
number of inpatient-bed-days * * * 
attributable to individuals with respect 
to whom payment may be made under 
part A’’ was not consistent with our 
statement the data entered on these 
lines in the cost report include ‘‘all 
patient days attributable to Medicare 
inpatients, excluding those in units not 
paid under the IPPS and excluding 
nursery days.’’ In this case, our error was 
in the specific cost report lines that we 
cited, rather than in our statement that 
the relevant statutory language 
(‘‘inpatient-bed-days * * * attributable 
to individuals with respect to whom 
payment may be made under part A’’) 
includes ‘‘all patient days attributable to 
Medicare inpatients, excluding those in 
units not paid under the IPPS and 
excluding nursery days.’’ As in the case 
which we discussed above with regard 
to counting ‘‘total discharges,’’ the 
relevant statutory language directs that 
the numerator and denominator of the 
Medicare share fraction incorporate 
inpatient bed-day counts for the eligible 
hospital, and, as discussed in our 
section on total discharges, ‘‘eligible 
hospital’’ is defined with reference to 
section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act, which 
specifically excludes from the definition 
psychiatric or rehabilitation units that 
are a distinct part of the hospital. 
Specifically, the ‘‘Medicare share’’ is to 
be ‘‘specified * * * for an eligible 
hospital.’’ The numerator of the 
Medicare share fraction is further 
defined as ‘‘the sum (* * * with respect 
to the eligible hospital) of— 
‘‘(I) the estimated number of inpatient- 
bed-days (as established by the 
Secretary) which are attributable to 
individuals with respect to whom 
payment may be made under part A; 
and 
‘‘(II) the estimated number of 
inpatient-bed-days (as so established) 
which are attributable to individuals 
who are enrolled with a Medicare 
Advantage organization under part C.’’ 
Finally, the denominator of the 
Medicare share fraction includes ‘‘the 
estimated total number of inpatient-bed- 
days with respect to the eligible 
hospital.’’ Therefore, the inpatient-bed- 
day counts included in the Medicare 
share fraction for purposes of the 
incentive payments provision do not 
extend to inpatient-bed-days in 
excluded units of the hospital, but only 
to inpatient-bed-days in the acute care 
portion of the hospital that receives 
Medicare payment under the inpatient 
PPS. In this final rule, we are revising 
section 495.104(c)(4) of the regulations 
in order to clarify this point. 
Since the publication of the proposed 
rule, we have adopted various changes 
to the Medicare cost report, including 
changes designed to accommodate the 
appropriate computation and final 
settlement of EHR incentive payments 
for qualifying hospitals. These changes 
are included in the pending cost report 
form, CMS Form 2552–10. In this 
revised form, the relevant Medicare 
inpatient days are entered in line 2 of 
the new Worksheet E–1, Part II, 
‘‘Calculation of Reimbursement for 
Settlement for HIT.’’ This new line is 
defined as the sum of lines 1 and 8 
through 12, from Worksheet S–3, Part I, 
column 6 of CMS Form 2552–10. These 
lines include all patient days 
attributable to Medicare inpatients, 
excluding those in units not paid under 
the IPPS, and excluding nursery days. 
Comment: Several commenters also 
contended that our proposed exclusion 
of nursery days from the determination 
of ‘‘inpatient-bed-days * * * 
attributable to individuals with respect 
to whom payment may be made under 
part A’’ is inappropriate. These 
commenters maintained that the 
statutory language is broad enough to 
include all inpatient days associated 
with Medicare eligible individuals 
without restriction based on the type of 
Part A patient. 
Response: In excluding nursery days 
from the count of Medicare inpatient 
bed days, we are following the 
precedent of not counting such days for 
purposes of the direct medical 
education, indirect medical education, 
and disproportionate share adjustments 
under the Medicare IPPS. As in the case 
of the term ‘‘subsection (d)’’ hospital, we 
believe that, in the absence of clear 
direction from the statute to the 
contrary, the most appropriate policy is

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
to interpret terms such as ‘‘inpatient 
bed-days’’ in the light of existing 
Medicare program policies and 
precedents. Under our policies for the 
direct medical education, indirect 
medical education and disproportionate 
share adjustments, a bed must be 
permanently maintained for lodging 
inpatients in order to be included in 
available inpatient bed and inpatient 
bed day counts. We exclude the days 
provided to newborns (except for those 
in intensive care units of the hospital) 
because healthy newborn infants are not 
provided with an acute level of hospital 
care. (This is not the case with 
newborns assigned to intensive care 
units, who are included in the counts 
for those units.) For these reasons, 
nursery days are explicitly excluded 
from: 
• The counts of Medicare inpatient 
hospital days and total inpatient 
hospital days for purposes of direct 
graduate medical education payments 
under section 413.75(b) of the 
regulations, where the definition of 
Medicare patient load reads: ‘‘Inpatient 
days in any distinct part of the hospital 
are included and nursery days are 
excluded.’’ 
• The counts of bed days for purposes 
of the Medicare indirect graduate 
medical education adjustment under 
section 412.105(b): the ‘‘count of 
available bed days excludes bed days 
associated with * * * (5) Beds or 
bassinets in the healthy newborn 
nursery * * *.’’ 
• The count of beds for purposes of 
the Medicare DSH adjustment under 
section 412.106(a)(i) of the regulations: 
‘‘The number of beds in a hospital is 
determined in accordance with 
§ 412.105(b).’’ 
We note that, in addition to excluding 
nursery days from the numerator of the 
Medicare share fraction, these days are 
excluded for the same reasons from the 
count of total inpatient bed days in the 
denominator of the Medicare share 
fraction. We therefore do not believe 
that excluding these days would result 
in disadvantage to hospitals in 
determining their Medicare share 
fractions for purposes of calculating 
EHR incentive payments. (See our 
discussion of the cost report data 
employed to determine total inpatient 
bed days in the denominator of the 
Medicare share fraction, below.) 
Comment: Other commenters 
maintained that swing bed days should 
also be included in the determination of 
‘‘inpatient bed-days * * * attributable 
to individuals with respect to whom 
payment may be made under part A.’’ 
Response: Once again, as in the case 
of the term ‘‘subsection(d)’’ hospital, we 
believe that, in the absence of clear 
direction from the statute to the 
contrary, the most appropriate policy is 
to interpret terms such as ‘‘inpatient 
bed-days’’ in the light of existing 
Medicare program policies and 
precedents. We are therefore also 
following the precedent of Medicare 
payment adjustments in excluding 
certain swing bed days from the count 
of Medicare inpatient days. As in these 
cases, swing bed days are excluded 
when the swing bed is used to furnish 
SNF care, because only the days used 
for inpatient hospital care will be 
included in the count of ‘‘inpatient bed- 
days * * * attributable to individuals 
with respect to whom payment may be 
made under part A.’’ Otherwise, we 
would be including non-inpatient bed- 
days in the count. 
Comment: One commenter objected 
that, for purposes of the Medicare 
inpatient day count in the Medicare 
share, we appeared to be proposing to 
use only paid Medicare days. This 
commenter argued that all eligible 
Medicare days should be counted in 
order to reflect a hospital’s true 
Medicare utilization. The commenter 
also maintained that the statute’s 
reference to days ‘‘attributable to 
individuals with respect to whom 
payment may be made under part A’’ 
requires inclusion of all days when a 
beneficiary was eligible for Medicare, on 
the grounds that this language ‘‘does not 
require actual payment by Medicare.’’ 
The commenter further noted that the 
other factor in the numerator of the 
Medicare share fraction requires 
inclusion of all patient days associated 
with individuals enrolled in a Part C 
Medicare Advantage plan, and 
maintained that there ‘‘would be no 
rational basis for Congress to include all 
enrolled Part C days, quite clearly 
regardless of whether they are paid, but 
to limit part A days to those paid by 
Medicare.’’ 
Response: We assume that, by the 
term ‘‘unpaid’’ Medicare days, the 
commenter is referring to days provided 
to Medicare entitled beneficiaries for 
which the services are non-covered, 
such as the cases in which a beneficiary 
has exhausted coverage of inpatient 
hospital services, or in which the 
services are not covered under a 
national or local coverage 
determination. We do not agree with the 
commenter that these days ought to be 
included in the count of ‘‘inpatient-bed- 
days * * * attributable to individuals 
with respect to whom payment may be 
made under part A.’’ Indeed, we believe 
that the best reading of this statutory 
language suggests the opposite of what 
the commenter maintains: In cases of 
non-covered days, payment may not be 
made under Part A, and therefore these 
days should not be included in a count 
of days ‘‘attributable to individuals with 
respect to whom payment may be made 
under part A.’’ We agree with the 
commenter that the language for the 
other factor in the numerator of the 
Medicare share fraction (‘‘inpatient-bed- 
days attributable * * * to individuals 
who are enrolled with a MA 
organization under Part C’’) is more 
inclusive. However, we must assume 
that the difference in the statutory 
language is meaningful. Therefore, we 
are finalizing our proposal not to 
include days provided to Medicare 
entitled beneficiaries for which the 
services are non-covered in the count of 
Medicare inpatient days. It is important 
to note that we do include such ‘‘non- 
paid’’ days for purposes of other 
Medicare payment provisions, where it 
is appropriate to do so under the 
governing statutory provisions. For 
example, for purposes of the Medicare 
DSH adjustment the relevant statutory 
language requires inclusion of days 
associated with individuals who are 
‘‘entitled’’ to benefits under Medicare 
Part A, rather than days for which 
‘‘payment may be made under part A.’’ 
After consideration of these 
comments, we are finalizing our 
proposals with regard to the data to be 
used to determine the ‘‘inpatient bed- 
days * * * attributable to individuals 
with respect to whom payment may be 
made under part A’’ in the numerator of 
the Medicare share fraction. 
Accordingly, we will derive this 
information from Worksheet E–1, Part II,

report, Form CMS–2552–10, which is 
defined as the sum of lines 1 and 8

3, Part I of the pending cost report. As 
we have just discussed, we are revising 
the cost report data sources from which 
we are deriving this information in 
order to be consistent with the statutory 
requirement. We are also revising 
§ 495.104(c)(4)(ii)(A)(2) of the

Comment: One commenter inquired 
about the status of inpatient-bed-days 
attributable to individuals enrolled in 
the 1876 Medicare cost plan operating 
under ‘‘billing option 2,’’ under which 
the section 1876 cost contractor pays 
hospitals for Part A benefits, and then 
claims reimbursement from CMS. The 
cost-contractor pays Part A benefits for 
its 36,000 enrolled Medicare 
beneficiaries to contracted hospitals in 
one State. The commenter maintained 
that a reasonable interpretation of the 
statutory language suggests that the 
inpatient bed days for these

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
beneficiaries should be counted in the 
numerator of the Medicare share 
fraction. The commenter requested 
clarification concerning the inclusion of 
these days in the data sources we 
proposed to employ, or the development 
of an appropriate remedy in order to 
ensure that they are counted. Another 
commenter noted that Worksheet S–3, 
Part I, column 4, line 2 in the Medicare 
cost report, CMS 2552–96, has 
historically been completed primarily 
by teaching hospitals, based on patient 
days reported on Provider Statistical 
and Reimbursement (PS&R) Report Type 
118. The commenter further stated that 
there have been many situations in 
which non-teaching hospitals reporting 
days on this cost report line have the 
days removed by the Medicare fiscal 
intermediary or Medicare administrative 
contractor (MAC), as PS&R Report Type 
118 contains no patient day data for 
non-teaching hospitals. The commenter 
recommended that we clarify our plans 
with regard to PS&R Report Type 118 
and allow the form to populate with 
accurate data for all hospitals 
submitting no-pay bills for Medicare 
beneficiaries who are enrolled in 
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans and 
who receive Medicare-covered hospital 
services. The commenter further noted 
that, at this time, CAHs and IPPS 
hospitals that do not receive the DSH 
adjustment are not required to submit 
no-pay bills for Medicare Advantage 
patients. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that all these days should 
be counted in the numerator of the 
Medicare share fraction. With respect to 
MA plan enrollees, these patients are 
already included in the ‘‘estimated 
number of inpatient-bed-days 
attributable * * * to individuals who 
are enrolled with a MA organization 
under Part C.’’ In order for the data on 
the inpatient days attributable to 
individuals enrolled in MA plans to be 
included on the Medicare cost report, 
the hospital must submit a ‘‘no-pay’’ bill 
to the Medicare contractor. We have 
issued instructions clarifying that 
hospitals must submit no-pay bills for 
inpatient days attributable to 
individuals enrolled in MA plans. 
Specifically, CR 5647, dated July 20, 
2007, required all hospitals paid under 
the inpatient prospective payment 
system (IPPS), inpatient rehabilitation 
facility prospective payment system 
(IRF PPS), and long term care hospital 
prospective payment system (LTCH 
PPS) to submit informational only 
Medicare Advantage claims. 
Furthermore, CR 6821, dated May 5, 
2010, provided that applicable IPPS, IRF 
PPS and LTC hospitals will be given one 
final opportunity to comply with the 
requirement to submit FY 2007 
informational only claims. In addition, 
these hospitals are required to attest in 
writing to their Medicare contractor that 
they have either submitted all of their 
Medicare Advantage claims for FY 2007 
or that they have no Medicare 
Advantage claims for that fiscal year. 
After consideration of the comments, we 
are finalizing our proposals for 
determining the ‘‘inpatient bed-days 
* * * attributable to individuals with 
respect to whom payment may be made 
under part A’’ and the ‘‘estimated 
number of inpatient-bed-days 
attributable * * * to individuals who 
are enrolled with a MA organization 
under Part C.’’ However, we are 
modifying the language of 
§ 495.104(c)(4)(ii)(A)(1) regarding the 
counting of inpatient bed-days 
attributable to individuals with respect 
to whom payment may be under part A 
to clarify that this count includes days 
attributable to enrollees under section 
1876 cost contracts where payments for 
Part A benefits are made by the section 
1876 contractor. We intend to derive 
this information from Worksheet E–1, 
Part II, line 3 of the pending Medicare 
cost report, Form CMS–2552–10, which 
is derived from line 2 in column 6, 
Worksheet S–3, Part I of the pending 
cost report. This data source on the 
revised Medicare cost report is the 
equivalent of the source we cited in the 
proposed rule. 
Section 1886(n)(2)(D)(ii) of the Act 
defines the denominator of the Medicare 
share fraction as the product of— 
• The estimated total number of 
inpatient-bed-days with respect to the 
eligible hospital during such period; 
and 
• The estimated total amount of the 
eligible hospital’s charges during such 
period, not including any charges that 
are attributable to charity care (as such 
term is used for purposes of hospital 
cost reporting under Title XVIII), 
divided by the estimated total amount of 
the hospital’s charges during such 
period. 
As in the case of Medicare Part A and 
Part C inpatient-bed days, for purposes 
of determining total inpatient-bed days 
in the denominator of the Medicare 
share fraction, we proposed to use the 
same data sources, and the same 
methods, that we employ in 
determining Medicare’s share for 
purposes of making payments for direct 
graduate medical education costs. 
Specifically, we proposed to derive the 
relevant data from lines 1, 6 through 9, 
10, and 14 in column 6 on Worksheet 
S–3, Part I of the Medicare cost report. 
We noted that the data entered on these 
lines in the cost report include all 
patient days attributable to inpatients, 
excluding those in units not paid under 
the IPPS. 
Comment: Several commenters noted, 
regarding our proposal concerning 
Medicare inpatient days in the 
denominator of the Medicare share 
fraction, an apparent contradiction 
between the cost report sources from 
which we proposed to derive ‘‘estimated 
total number of inpatient-bed-days with 
respect to the eligible hospital during 
such period’’ (lines 1, 6 through 9, 10, 
and 14 in column 6 on Worksheet S–3, 
Part I), and our statement that ‘‘the data 
entered on these lines in the cost report 
include all patient days attributable to 
inpatients, excluding those in units not 
paid under the IPPS .’’ These 
commenters supported our proposal to 
employ the data from those lines of the 
cost report, on the grounds that these 
cost report lines adequately capture the 
necessary data. However, as the 
commenters pointed out, the data on the 
identified lines do include patient days 
in units not paid under the inpatient 
PPS. And these commenters contended 
that the relevant statutory language (‘‘the 
estimated total number of inpatient-bed- 
days with respect to the eligible hospital 
during such period’’) would seem to 
include patient days in units excluded 
from the inpatient PPS. 
Response: As in the case of the 
equivalent issue with regard to 
Medicare inpatient bed days, we agree 
with the commenters that our citation of 
the specific cost report sources from 
which we proposed to derive the ‘‘the 
estimated total number of inpatient-bed- 
days with respect to the eligible hospital 
during such period’’ was not consistent 
with our statement that the data entered 
on these lines in the cost ‘‘include all 
patient days attributable to inpatients, 
excluding those in units not paid under 
the IPPS.’’ And as in the case of 
Medicare inpatient-bed-days, our error 
was in the specific cost report lines that 
we cited, rather than in our statement 
that the relevant statutory language (‘‘the 
estimated total number of inpatient-bed- 
days with respect to the eligible 
hospital’’) includes ‘‘all patient days 
attributable to inpatients, excluding 
those in units not paid under the IPPS.’’. 
As we have discussed in connection 
with counting discharges and Medicare 
inpatient-bed-days, the relevant 
statutory language directs that the 
denominator of the Medicare share 
fraction incorporate inpatient bed-day 
counts for the eligible hospital. 
Therefore, the inpatient-bed-day counts 
included in the Medicare share fraction 
for purposes of the incentive payments

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
provision do not extend to inpatient- 
bed-days in excluded units of the 
hospital, but only to inpatient-bed-days 
in the acute care portion of the hospital 
that receives payment for Medicare 
purposes under the inpatient PPS. 
We are finalizing our proposal for 
determining the count of total inpatient- 
bed days in the denominator of the 
Medicare share fraction as including all 
patient days attributable to inpatients, 
excluding those in units not paid under 
the IPPS. Accordingly, we will derive 
this information from Worksheet E–1, 
Part II, line 4 of the pending Medicare 
cost report, Form CMS–2552–10, which 
is defined as the sum of lines 1and 8 
through 12, in column 8, Worksheet S– 
3, Part I of the pending cost report. As 
we have just discussed, we are revising 
the cost report data sources from which 
we are deriving this information in 
order to be consistent with the statutory 
requirement. In this final rule, we are 
also revising § 495.104(c)(4)(ii)(B)(1) to 
clarify this point. 
As we noted above, the denominator 
of the Medicare share fraction also 
includes the ‘‘estimated total amount of 
the eligible hospital’s charges during 
such period, not including any charges 
that are attributable to charity care (as 
such term is used for purposes of 
hospital cost reporting under Title 
XVIII), divided by the estimated total 
amount of the hospital’s charges during 
such period.’’ We discuss the data 
sources and methods for calculating the 
charges and charity care portions of this 
formula in the next section. 
d. Incentive Payment Calculation for 
Eligible Hospitals: Charity Care and 
Charges 
In determining the denominator of the 
Medicare share fraction, we also must 
determine any charges that are 
attributable to charity care furnished by 
an eligible hospital or CAH. The 
exclusion of charges attributable to 
charity care has the effect of decreasing 
the denominator of the Medicare share 
fraction as the proportion of charity care 
(charity care charge ratio) provided by a 
hospital increases. This is because the 
ratio of estimated total hospital charges, 
not including charges attributable to 
charity care, to estimated total hospital 
charges during a period decreases, 
relatively speaking, as a hospital 
provides a greater proportion of charity 
care. The effect of a greater charity care 
factor on the denominator of the 
Medicare share fraction is therefore to 
decrease the denominator (as the total 
number of inpatient-bed days is 
multiplied by a relatively lower charity 
care charge ratio), as a hospital provides 
a greater proportion of charity care. A 
smaller denominator increases the 
Medicare share factor, providing for 
higher incentive payments, to a hospital 
that provides a greater proportion of 
charity care. Conversely, as a hospital 
provides a lower proportion of charity 
care, the ratio of estimated total hospital 
charges, not including charges 
attributable to charity care, to estimated 
total hospital charges during a period 
increases. 
For the purposes of this final rule, we 
define charity care as part of 
uncompensated and indigent care 
described for Medicare cost reporting 
purposes in the Medicare cost report 
instructions at section 4012 of the 
Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM), 
Part 2; Worksheet S–10; Hospital 
Uncompensated and Indigent Care Data. 
Subsection (d) hospitals and CAHs are 
required to complete the Worksheet 
S–10. 
As part of the Form CMS–2552–10 
described above, the revised Worksheet 
S–10 instructions define 
uncompensated care as follows: ‘‘* * * 
charity care and bad debt which 
includes non-Medicare bad debt and 
non-reimbursable Medicare bad debt. 
Uncompensated care does not include 
courtesy allowances or discounts given 
to patients.’’ These instructions further 
define charity care to include health 
services for which a hospital 
demonstrates that the patient is unable 
to pay. Charity care results from a 
hospital’s policy to provide all or a 
portion of services free of charge to 
patients who meet certain financial 
criteria. For Medicare purposes, charity 
care is not reimbursable, and unpaid 
amounts associated with charity care are 
not considered as an allowable 
Medicare bad debt. Therefore, we 
proposed to use the charity care charges 
that are reported on line 19 of the 
revised Worksheet S–10 in the 
computation of the Medicare share of 
the incentive payments. Line number 19 
of the revised Worksheet S–10, as 
proposed, has changed to line number 
20 based on the pending OMB approved 
final Form CMS–2552–10. Only the line 
number has changed as the instructions 
are the same for line 19 as proposed and 
for line 20 in the pending final OMB 
approved Worksheet S–10. Thus, the 
charity care charges used to calculate 
the final Medicare share is reported on 
line 20 of the pending final OMB 
approved Worksheet S–10. 
Under section 1886(n)(2)(D) of the 
Act, if the Secretary determines that 
data are not available on charity care 
necessary to calculate the portion of the 
formula specified in clause (ii)(II) of 
section 1886(n)(2)(D) of the Act, the 
Secretary shall use data on 
uncompensated care and may adjust 
such data so as to be an appropriate 
proxy for charity care including a 
downward adjustment to eliminate bad 
debt data from uncompensated care 
data. In the absence of the data 
necessary for the Secretary to compute 
the amount described in clause (ii)(II) of 
section 1886(n)(2)(D) of the Act, the 
amount under such clause shall be 
deemed to be 1. 
We believe that the charity care 
charges reported on line 20 of the 
pending final OMB approved Worksheet 
S–10 represent the most accurate 
measure of charity care charges as part 
of the hospital’s overall reporting of 
uncompensated and indigent care for 
Medicare purposes. Therefore, since 
eligible hospitals and CAHs are required 
to complete the Worksheet S–10, if a 
hospital has not properly reported any 
charity care charges on line 20, we may 
question the accuracy of the charges 
used for computing the final Medicare 
share of the incentive payments. With 
appropriate resources, we believe the 
charity care data can be obtained by the 
MAC. This data would be used to 
determine if the hospital’s charity care 
criteria are appropriate, if a hospital 
should have reported charity care 
charges, and if the reported charges are 
proper. If we determine, as based on the 
determination of the MAC, that the 
hospital did not properly report charity 
care charges on line 20 of the pending 
final OMB approved Worksheet S–10, 
then we proposed to deem the portion 
of the denominator described in section 
1886(n)(2)(D)(ii)(II) of the Act to be 1. 
In the proposed rule, we specifically 
solicited public comments on the 
charity care financial criteria 
established by each hospital and 
reviewed by the MACs, the collection of 
charity care data on the Worksheet 
S–10, and whether proxies for charity 
care may be developed with other data 
available to us. 
Comment: Some commenters 
requested that CMS clarify the 
definition of charity care. One 
commenter believed the CMS 
incorrectly indicated that Medicare does 
not reimburse for charity care. The 
commenter believed this statement is 
inconsistent with section 312 of the 
Provider reimbursement Manual (PRM). 
Response: Section 1886(n)(2)(D)(ii)(II) 
of the Act defines charity care charges 
to compute the Medicare share as such 
term is used for purposes of hospital 
cost reporting under Medicare. Thus, we 
are adopting our proposed definition of 
charity care as part of uncompensated 
and indigent care described for 
Medicare cost reporting purposes in the

 44457 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Medicare cost report instructions as 
described above. 
In addition, we believe that our 
statement is correct in that Medicare 
does not pay for charity care in 
accordance with the regulations and 
manual instructions. Specifically, 
section 413.89(b)(1) of the Medicare 
regulations defines bad debts as 
amounts considered to be uncollectible 
from accounts and notes receivable that 
were created or acquired in providing 
services. ‘‘Accounts receivable’’ and 
‘‘notes receivable’’ are designations for 
claims arising from the furnishing of 
services, and are collectible in money in 
the relatively near future. Section 
413.89(b)(2) of the Medicare regulations 
defines charity allowances as reductions 
in charges made by the provider of 
services because of the indigence or 
medical indigence of the patient. Cost of 
free care (uncompensated services) 
furnished under a Hill-Burton obligation 
are considered as charity allowances. 
Furthermore, section 413.89(g) states 
that charity allowances have no 
relationship to beneficiaries of the 
Medicare program and are not allowable 
costs. These charity allowances include 
the costs of uncompensated services 
furnished under a Hill-Burton 
obligation. 
Also, section 312 of the PRM states 
that, for Medicare bad debt purposes, a 
non-Medicaid beneficiary may be 
considered indigent or medically 
indigent and that once indigence is 
determined and the provider concludes 
that no improvements in the 
beneficiary’s financial condition exist, 
the debt may be deemed uncollectible 
without applying the collection 
requirements of section 310 of the PRM. 
We believe that the instructions at 
section 312 of the PRM specify bad debt 
amounts that may be allowable under 
section 413.89 of the regulations and, 
thus, these instructions are not related 
to charity care amounts that are not 
allowable for Medicare. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
the definition of charity care these 
provisions as proposed. 
Comment: We received some 
comments asking if CMS will adopt 
standards to determine if a hospital’s 
charity care policy is sufficient to 
qualify for the inclusion of charges in 
the formula for EHR and whether that 
same policy would suffice to meet the 
criteria to determine the eligibility for 
Medicare bad debt. 
Response: Currently for bad debt 
purposes, section 312 of the PRM 
requires the provider to perform asset/ 
income tests of patient resources for 
non-Medicaid beneficiaries. These tests 
will be used to determine if the 
beneficiary meets the provider’s 
indigent policy to qualify an unpaid 
deductible and/or coinsurance amount 
as a Medicare bad debt. The provider is 
responsible for developing its indigent 
policy. Currently, the Medicare 
contractor will determine if the indigent 
policies are appropriate for determining 
allowable Medicare bad debt under 
section 312 of the PRM and § 413.89 of 
the regulations. We believe that the 
Medicare contractor will continue to 
determine if the provider’s indigent 
policy for bad debt purposes is 
appropriate and can determine if the 
same policy would be sufficient to use 
for charity care purposes. 
Comment: We received many 
comments on the use of charity care 
charge data from line 19 of the revised 
worksheet S–10, as proposed. 
Commenters urge CMS to calculate 
charity care costs by starting with the 
amount of charges a hospital has written 
off. Commenters noted that this 
modification would help streamline and 
unify charity care reporting across the 
Federal government (based on the way 
Internal Revenue Service (IRS)) requires 
charity care to be reported) ensure 
consistency of reporting, and avoid 
significantly increasing hospitals’ 
administrative burden. 
Response: As described above, we use 
charity care charges from line 20 of the 
pending final OMB approved worksheet 
S–10 that captures ‘‘total initial payment 
obligations of the patients who are given 
full or partial discounts, based on the 
hospital’s charity care criteria 
(measured a full charge), for care 
delivered during the cost reporting 
period for the entire facility.’’ Similar 
comments received on our proposed 
rule were also received on the Agency 
Information Collection Activities: 
Proposed Collection: Comment Request 
published in the July 2, 2009 Federal 
Register (74 FR 31738). CMS issued a 
revised package, Agency Information 
Collection Activities: Submission for 
OMB Review: Comment Request, in the 
April 30, 2010 Federal Register (75 FR 
22810). The comment period for the 
submission for OMB review ended June 
1, 2010. OMB will review the comments 
received and issue an approved Form 
CMS 2552 10. The OMB approved Form 
CMS–2552–10 will be effective for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
May 1, 2010. 
Comment: Some commenters noted 
that the Hospital Uncompensated Care 
and Indigent Care Worksheet S–10 that 
CMS proposed to revise in the July 2, 
2009 Federal Register (74 FR 31738) 
would not be timely (based on the 
anticipated effective date for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
February 1, 2010 as stated in the 
proposed rule), and therefore, hospitals 
with cost reporting periods beginning 
on November 1, 2009, December 1, 2009 
or January 1, 2010 would not have the 
opportunity to report charity care data 
for the first year of the incentive 
payment. Commenters further 
highlighted their concern for available 
data necessary to be included in interim 
payments and for final payments for 
periods that end December 31, 2010. 
Commenters urged CMS to develop an 
interim mechanism for hospitals to 
report the necessary information so that 
no hospital receives a charity care 
adjustment of ‘‘1’’ merely because of its 
cost reporting cycle. Some commenters 
suggested that CMS use other charity 
care data. Some commenters suggested 
that CMS use the current version of the 
Medicare cost report, Form CMS–2552– 
96, to determine interim incentive 
payments. 
Response: To calculate the Medicare 
share, which includes the charges for 
charity care, we proposed in the 
proposed rule to employ data from the 
hospitals fiscal year that ends during the 
FY prior to the FY that serves as the 
payment year as the basis for 
preliminary payment. We further stated 
that final payment would be made on 
the basis of the data from the hospital 
fiscal year that ends during the FY that 
serves as the payment year. After 
consideration of the public comments 
received, we are revising the provision 
that for purposes of determining 
preliminary incentive payments, we 
will employ data on the hospital’s/ 
CAH’s Medicare fee-for-service and 
managed care inpatient bed days, total 
inpatient bed-days, and charges for 
charity care from a hospital’s/CAH’s 
most recently submitted 12-month cost 
report once the hospital has qualified as 
a meaningful user. For purposes of 
determining final incentive payments, 
we will employ the first 12-month cost 
reporting period that begins after the 
start of the payment year, in order to 
settle payments on the basis of the 
hospital’s/CAH’s Medicare fee-for- 
service and managed care inpatient bed 
days, total inpatient bed-days, and 
charges for charity care data from that 
cost reporting period. 
In addition, as described in the 
proposed rule, hospitals have been 
required to fill out the worksheet S–10 
of the Form CMS 2552–96 since the 
BBRA of 1999 was enacted. We 
recognize that the charity care data from 
the 2552–96 worksheet S–10 may have 
some limitations because, in some cases, 
providers failed to complete the 
worksheet either partially or in its

entirety. Furthermore, in the past CMS 
did not review the worksheet S–10 
because the data had no Medicare 
payment implications. Thus, in the 
absence of availability of charity care 
data from the OMB approved Form CMS 
2552–10, a hospital for the purposes of 
calculating the charity care charges in 
the interim may use the information 
from the 2552–96 worksheet S–10; line 
22 until the revised worksheet is 
available. We believe that the Medicare 
contractor can make a determination if 
the charity care charges from the 2552– 
96 are appropriate, and if so, use such 
charges in determining the preliminary 
incentive payment amount for hospitals, 
as described above. Since CAHs were 
not required to fill out the 2552–96 
worksheet S–10, charity care charges 
may not be available to determine 
preliminary incentive payments until 
the revised worksheet is available. 
However, using data from the first 12- 
month cost reporting period that begins 
after the start of the payment year, as 
described above, hospitals and CAHs 
will calculate the final incentive 
payment amount with data from the 
pending Form CMS–2552–10 Medicare 
cost report that is effective for cost 
reporting periods beginning on or after 
May 1, 2010. 
Comment: Several commenters 
pointed out that we had failed to 
identify the source of the data for 
‘‘estimated total amount of the eligible 
hospital’s charges’’ in the proposed rule. 
Some of these commenters 
recommended that we employ 
Worksheet C, Column 8, line 103 for 
this purpose. 
Response: We did neglect to identify 
the source of the data for ‘‘estimated 
total amount of the eligible hospital’s 
charges’’ in the proposed rule. In the 
final rule, we are providing that, for this 
purpose, we will employ the data from 
Worksheet E–1, Part II, line 5 of the 
revised Medicare cost report, Form 
CMS–2552–10, which in turn derives 
this information from line 200 in 
column 8, Worksheet C, Part I of the 
pending cost report. We note that line 
200 in column 8, Worksheet C, Part I of 
the revised cost report is the equivalent 
of 101, Column 8, Worksheet C of the 
current cost report. We are employing 
the equivalent of line 101, rather than 
the equivalent of line 103, as 
recommended by the commenters, 
because line 101 (current line 200) 
includes the charges for observation, 
and accordingly reflects the ‘‘total 
amount of the eligible hospital’s 
charges’’ more truly than line 103, 
which excludes those charges. 
e. Incentive Payment Calculation for 
Eligible Hospitals: Transition Factor 
As we have previously discussed, the 
initial amount must be multiplied not 
only by the Medicare share fraction, but 
also by an applicable transition factor in 
order to determine the incentive 
payment to an eligible hospital for an 
incentive payment year. Section 
1886(n)(2)(E)(i) of the Act designates 
that the applicable transition factor 
equals one (1) For the first payment 
year, three-fourths for the second 
payment year, one-half for the third 
payment year, one-fourth for the fourth 
payment year, and zero thereafter. 
However, section 1886(n)(2)(E)(ii) of the 
Act provides that if ‘‘the first payment 
year for an eligible hospital is after 
2013, then the transition factor specified 
in this subparagraph for a payment year 
for such hospital is the same as the 
amount specified in clause (i) for such 
payment year for an eligible hospital for 
which the first payment year is 2013.’’ 
Accordingly, if a hospital’s first 
payment year is FY 2014, then the 
applicable transition factor equals three- 
fourths (3⁄4) for the first payment year 
(FY 2014), one-half (1⁄2) for the second 
payment year (FY 2015), one-fourth (1⁄4) 
for the third payment year (FY 2015), 
and zero thereafter. If a hospital’s first 
payment year is FY 2015, then the 
applicable transition factor equals (1⁄2) 
for the first payment year (FY 2015), (1⁄4) 
for the second payment year (FY 2016), 
and zero thereafter. As discussed in 
more detail below, under section 
1886(n)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act, the 
transition factor for a hospital for which 
the first payment year is after 2015 
equals zero for all years. In other words, 
2015 is the last year for which eligible 
hospitals may begin participation in the 
Medicare EHR Incentive Program.

f. Duration and Timing of Incentive 
Payments 
Section 1886(n)(2)(E)(i) of the Act 
establishes that an eligible hospital that 
is a meaningful user of certified EHR 
technology could receive up to 4 years 
of financial incentive payments. The 
transition factor phases down the 
incentive payments over the 4-year 
period. Therefore, an eligible hospital 
that is a meaningful user of certified 
EHR technology during the relevant 
EHR reporting period, in payment year 
FY 2011, could receive incentive 
payments beginning with FY 2011 
(transition factor equals 1), and for FY 
2012 (transition factor equals 3⁄4), 2013 
(transition factor equals 1⁄2), and 2014 
(transition factor equals 1⁄4) if they 
continue to be a meaningful user of 
certified EHR technology during the 
relevant EHR reporting periods. 
Section 1886(n)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act 
establishes the range of time during 
which a hospital may begin to receive 
incentive payments, and the applicable 
transition periods for hospitals that are 
permitted to begin receiving incentive 
payments after FY 2011. Specifically, 
that section provides that if the ‘‘first 
payment year for an eligible hospital is 
after 2015, the transition factor * * * 
for such hospital and for such year and 
subsequent year shall be 0.’’ This clause 
in effect provides that no incentive 
payments will be available to a hospital 
that would begin to receive such 
payments after FY 2015. In other words, 
FY 2015 is the last FY in which a 
hospital can begin to receive incentive 
payments. Taken together, sections 
1886(n)(2)(G)(i) and 1886(n)(2)(E)(ii) of 
the Act allow hospitals to begin 
receiving incentive payments during 
FYs 2011 through 2015. Section 
1886(n)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act also 
establishes the transition periods and 
factors that will be in effect for hospitals 
that begin to receive transition 
payments during FY 2014 and 2015. As 
discussed previously, that section states 
that if ‘‘the first payment year for an 
eligible hospital is after 2013, then the 
transition factor specified in this 
subparagraph for a payment year for 
such hospital is the same as the amount 
specified in clause (i) for such payment 
year for an eligible hospital for which 
the first payment year is 2013.’’ Section 
1886(n)(2)(E)(ii) of the Act also 
establishes the transition periods that 
will be in effect for hospitals that begin 
to receive transition payments during 
FYs 2014 through 2015. That section 
states that if ‘‘the first payment year for 
an eligible hospital is after 2013, then 
the transition factor specified in this 
subparagraph for a payment year for 
such hospital is the same as the amount 
specified in clause (i) for such payment 
year for an eligible hospital for which 
the first payment year is 2013.’’ By 
implication, this clause establishes that, 
for hospitals that begin to receive 
incentive payments in FYs 2012 and 
2013, the transition periods are 
equivalent to those for hospitals that 
begin to receive such payments in FY 
2011. An eligible hospital that is a 
meaningful user of certified EHR 
technology could receive incentive 
payments beginning with FY 2012 
(transition factor equals 1), and for FY 
2013 (transition factor equals 3⁄4), FY 
2014 (transition factor equals 1⁄2), and 
FY 2015 (transition factor equals 1⁄4). 
Similarly, an eligible hospital that is a 
meaningful EHR user could receive 
incentive payments beginning with FY 
2013 (transition factor equals 1), and for 
FYs 2014 (transition factor equals 3⁄4), 
2015 (transition factor equals 1⁄2), and 
2016 (transition factor equals 1⁄4). 
However, this section also specifically 
provides that the transition factor is 
modified for those eligible hospitals that 
first become meaningful users of 
certified EHR technology beginning in 
2014 or 2015. Such hospitals would 
receive payments as if they became 
meaningful EHR users beginning in 
2013. In other words, if a hospital were 
to begin to demonstrate meaningful use 
of EHR certified technology in 2014, the 
transition factor used for that year 
(2014) would be 3⁄4 instead of 1, 1⁄2 for 
the second year (2015), 1⁄4 for the third 
year (2016), and zero thereafter. 
Similarly, if a hospital were to begin

meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology in 2015, the transition factor 
used for that year would be 1⁄2 instead 
of 1, 1⁄4 for the second year (2016), and 
zero thereafter. 
Table 25 shows the possible years an 
eligible hospital could receive an 
incentive payment and the transition 
factor applicable to each year. 
Comment: Several commenters 
pointed out an apparent inconsistency 
in the regulation text that we proposed 
to implement the transition period and 
applicable transition factors for EHR 
incentive payments. Specifically, the 
commenters noted that proposed section 
495.104(b)(5) states that hospitals 
‘‘whose first payment year is FY 2015 
may receive such payments for FY 2015 
through 2017’’ (emphasis supplied), 
while proposed section 495.104(c)(5) 
states that the transition factors for 
hospitals ‘‘whose first payment year is 
FY 2015’’ are: 
(A) 1⁄2 for FY 2015; and 
(B) 1⁄4 for FY 2016. (Emphasis 
supplied.) 
Response: These commenters are 
correct. Our proposed section 
495.104(b)(5) contained a typographical 
error. In order to be consistent with the 
clear requirements of the statute, section 
495.104(b)(5) should have stated that 
hospitals ‘‘whose first payment year is 
FY 2015 may receive such payments for 
FY 2015 through 2016.’’ In this final 
rule, we are revising section 
495.104(b)(5) of the final regulations 
accordingly. 
g. Incentive Payment Adjustment 
Effective in FY 2015 and Subsequent 
Years for Eligible Hospitals Who Are 
Not Meaningful EHR Users 
In addition to providing for incentive 
payments for meaningful use of EHRs 
during a transition period, section 
1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended by 
section 4102(b)(1) of the HITECH Act, 
provides for an adjustment to the market 
basket update to the IPPS payment rate 
for those eligible hospitals that are not 
meaningful EHR users for the EHR 
reporting period for a payment year, 
beginning in FY 2015. Specifically, 
section 1886(b)(3)(B) of the Act provides 
that, ‘‘for FY 2015 and each subsequent 
FY,’’ an eligible hospital that is not ‘‘a 
meaningful EHR user * * * for an EHR 
reporting period’’ will receive a reduced 
update to the IPPS standardized 
amount. This reduction will apply to 
‘‘three-quarters of the percentage 
increase otherwise applicable.’’ For FY 
2015 and each subsequent FY, the 
reduction to three-quarters of the 
applicable update for an eligible 
hospital that is not a meaningful EHR 
user will be ‘‘331⁄3 percent for FY 2015, 
662⁄3 percent for FY 2016, and 100 
percent for FY 2017 and each 
subsequent FY.’’ In other words, the 
Secretary is required to subject eligible 
hospitals who are not meaningful users 
to 1⁄4, 1⁄2, and 3⁄4 reductions of their 
market basket updates in FY 2015, FY 
2016, and FY 2017 and subsequent 
years respectively. Section 4102(b)(1)(B) 
of the HITECH Act also provides that 
such ‘‘reduction shall apply only with 
respect to the FY involved and the 
Secretary shall not take into account 
such reduction in computing the 
applicable percentage increase * * * for 
a subsequent FY.’’ This provision 
establishes a continuing incentive for 
hospitals to become meaningful EHR 
users, because a hospital that does 
become a meaningful EHR user in any 
year after the effective date of the 
update reduction will receive the same, 
fully updated standardized amount for 
that year, and subsequent years, as those 
hospitals that were already meaningful 
EHR users at the time when the update 
reduction went into effect (although 
hospitals would remain subject to a 
separate reduction for failure to report 
quality data under RHQDAPU). In order 
to conform with this new update 
reduction, section 4102(b)(1)(A) of the 
HITECH Act revises section 
1886(b)(3)(B)(viii)(1) of the Act to 
provide that, beginning with FY 2015, 
the reduction to the IPPS applicable 
percentage increase for failure to submit 
data on quality measures to the 
Secretary shall be one-quarter of the 
applicable market basket update. In this 
way, even the combined reductions for 
EHR use and quality data reporting will 
not produce an update of less than zero 
for a hospital in a given FY as long as 
the hospital market basket remains a 
positive number. 
In the proposed rule, we noted that 
specific proposals to implement these 
payment adjustments for subsection (d) 
hospitals that are not meaningful EHR 
users were not being made at that time, 
but would be subject to future 
rulemaking prior to the 2015 
implementation date. We invited 
comments on these payment 
adjustments, and stated any comments 
received would be considered in 
developing future proposals to 
implement these provisions. 
We received a few comments on this 
provision. 
3. Incentive Payments for Critical 
Access Hospitals (CAHs) 
Section 1814(l)(3)(A) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4102(a)(2) of the 
HITECH Act, also provides for incentive 
payments for CAHs that are meaningful 
users of certified EHR technology during 
an EHR reporting period for a cost 
reporting period beginning during a 
payment year after FY 2010 but before 
FY 2016. The criteria for being a 
meaningful EHR user, and the manner 
for demonstrating meaningful use, are 
discussed in section II.A.2. of this final 
rule.

 44461 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
a. Definition of CAHs for Medicare 
Section 1861(mm)(1) of the Act 
defines a CAH as a facility that has been 
certified as a critical access hospital 
under section 1820(c). CAHs are 
reimbursed for services furnished to 
Medicare beneficiaries under section 
1814(l) of the Act for inpatient services 
and section 1834(g) of the Act for 
outpatient services. Incentive payments 
for CAHs under section 1814(l)(3)(A) of 
the Act will be calculated based on the 
provider number used for cost reporting 
purposes, which is the CCN of the main 
provider. The process for making 
incentive payments to CAHs is 
discussed in section II.B.4.c. of this final 
rule. 
Comment: We received many 
comments on the use of the CCN to 
identify CAHs. Most comments were 
similar to those received on the use of 
the CCN for determining incentive 
payments to eligible hospitals. 
Response: We responded to the 
comments for eligible hospitals 
elsewhere in this final rule. Our 
responses to comments received on 
using the CCN to identify CAHs are the 
same as the responses for eligible 
hospital. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
our policy as proposed. For purposes of 
this provision, we will provide 
incentive payments to qualifying CAHs 
as they are distinguished by the 
provider number in the CAH’s cost 
reports. Incentive payments for 
qualifying CAHs will be calculated 
based on the provider number used for 
cost reporting purposes, which is the 
CCN of the main provider (also referred 
to as OSCAR number). Payments to 
qualifying CAHs will be made to each 
provider of record. 
b. Current Medicare Payment of 
Reasonable Cost for CAHs 
For Medicare purposes, CAHs are 
paid for most inpatient and outpatient 
services to Medicare beneficiaries on the 
basis of reasonable cost under section 
1814(l) and section 1834(g) of the Act, 
respectively. Thus, CAHs are not subject 
to the IPPS and Hospital Outpatient 
Prospective Payment System (OPPS). 
Section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act is the 
statutory basis for reasonable cost 
reimbursement in Medicare. Under the 
reasonable cost reimbursement 
methodology, payments to providers are 
based on the reasonable cost of 
furnishing Medicare-covered services to 
beneficiaries. Reasonable cost includes 
all necessary and proper costs in 
furnishing the services, subject to the 
principles of reasonable cost 
reimbursement relating to certain 
specific items of revenue and cost. 
Reasonable cost takes into account both 
direct and indirect costs of providers of 
services, including normal standby 
costs. The objective of the reasonable 
cost methodology is to ensure that the 
costs for individuals covered by the 
program are not borne by others not so 
covered, and the costs for individuals 
not so covered are not borne by the 
program. The reasonable costs of 
services and the items to be included 
are determined in accordance with the 
regulations at 42 CFR part 413, manual 
guidance, and other CMS instructions. 
Currently, under section 1814(l)(1) of 
the Act and § 413.70(a) of the 
regulations, effective for cost reporting 
periods beginning on or after January 1, 
2004, payment for inpatient services of 
a CAH, other than services of a distinct 
part unit of a CAH, is 101 percent of the 
reasonable costs of the CAH in 
providing CAH services to its inpatients, 
as determined in accordance with 
section 1861(v)(1)(A) of the Act and 
with the applicable principles of cost 
reimbursement in Parts 413 and 415 of 
the regulations. However, payment for 
inpatient CAH services is not subject to 
the reasonable cost principles of the 
lesser of cost or charges, the reasonable 
compensation equivalent limits for 
physician services to providers, the 
ceilings on hospital operating costs, or 
the payment window provisions for 
preadmission services, specified in 
§ 412.2(c)(5) and § 413.40(c)(2). Section 
1834(g) of the Act and § 413.70(b) of the 
regulations describe the payment 
methodology for outpatient services 
furnished by a CAH. 
Currently, reasonable cost 
reimbursement for CAHs includes 
payment for depreciation of depreciable 
assets used in providing covered 
services to beneficiaries, as described 
under Part 413 subpart G of our 
regulations and § 104 of the Medicare 
Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM). 
In general, the depreciation expense of 
an asset, representing a portion of the 
depreciable asset’s costs which is 
allocable to a period of operation, is 
determined by distributing the 
acquisition costs of the depreciable 
asset, less any salvage costs, over the 
estimated useful life of the asset. 
c. Changes Made by the HITECH Act 
Sections 4102(a)(2) and 4102(b)(2) of 
the HITECH Act amended section 
1814(l) of the Act, which governs 
payment for inpatient CAH services. 
The HITECH Act did not amend section 
1834(g) of the Act, which governs 
payment for outpatient CAH services. 
Sections 4102(a)(2) and 4102(b)(2) of 
the HITECH Act amended section 
1814(l) of the Act by adding new 
paragraphs (3), (4), and (5) as follows: 
Section 1814(l)(3)(A) of the Act 
provides the following: 
The following rules shall apply in 
determining payment and reasonable costs 
* * * for a critical access hospital that 
would be a meaningful EHR user (as would 
be determined under paragraph (3) of section 
1886(n)) for an EHR reporting period for a 
cost reporting period beginning during a 
payment year if such critical access hospital 
was treated as an eligible hospital under such 
section: 
(i) The Secretary shall compute reasonable 
costs by expensing such costs in a single 
payment year and not depreciating these 
costs over a period of years (and shall 
include as costs with respect to cost reporting 
periods beginning during a payment year 
costs from previous cost reporting periods to 
the extent they have not been fully 
depreciated as of the period involved). 
(ii) There shall be substituted for the 
Medicare share that would otherwise be 
applied [to CAHs under section 1814(l)(1),] a 
percent (not to exceed 100 percent) equal to 
the sum of— 
(I) The Medicare share (as would be 
specified under paragraph (2)(D) of section 
1886(n)) for such critical access hospital if 
such critical access hospital was treated as an 
eligible hospital under such section; and 
(II) 20 percentage points. 
Section 1814(l)(3)(B) of the Act 
provides that the incentive payment for 
CAHs will be paid ‘‘through a prompt 
interim payment (subject to 
reconciliation) after submission and 
review of such information (as specified 
by the Secretary) necessary to make 
such payment.’’ The provision also 
states that ‘‘[i]n no case may payment 
under this paragraph be made with 
respect to a cost reporting period 
beginning during a payment year after 
2015 and in no case may a critical 
access hospital receive payment under 
this paragraph with respect to more than 
4 consecutive payment years.’’ 
Section 1814(l)(3)(C) of the Act 
provides that the reasonable costs for 
which a CAH may receive an incentive 
payment are costs for the purchase of 
certified EHR technology to which 
purchase depreciation (excluding 
interest) would otherwise apply under 
section 1814(l)(1) of the Act. 
Section 1814(l)(4)(A) of the Act 
provides for an adjustment, subject to 
the hardship exemption in section 
1814(l)(4)(C) of the Act, to a CAH’s 
reimbursement at 101 percent of its 
reasonable costs if the CAH has not met 
the meaningful EHR user definition for 
an EHR reporting period that begins in 
FY 2015 or a subsequent fiscal year. 
Section 1814(l)(4)(B) of the Act specifies 
that if a CAH is not a meaningful EHR

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
user during the cost reporting period 
beginning in FY 2015, its 
reimbursement will be reduced from 
101 percent of its reasonable costs to 
100.66 percent. For FY 2016, the 
percentage of reimbursement for a CAH 
that is not a meaningful EHR user is 
reduced to 100.33 percent of its 
reasonable costs. For FY 2017 and each 
subsequent FY, the percentage of 
reimbursement is reduced to 100 
percent of reasonable costs. Section 
1814(l)(4)(C) of the Act states that, as 
provided for eligible subsection (d) 
hospitals, the Secretary may, on a case- 
by-case basis, exempt a CAH from this 
adjustment if the Secretary determines, 
subject to annual renewal, that requiring 
the CAH to be a meaningful EHR user 
during a cost reporting period beginning 
in FY 2015 or a subsequent fiscal year 
would result in a significant hardship, 
such as in the case of a CAH in a rural 
area without sufficient Internet access. 
However, in no case may a CAH be 
granted an exemption under this 
provision for more than 5 years. 
Section 1814(l)(5) provides that there 
shall be no administrative or judicial 
review under sections 1869 or 1878 of 
the Act, or otherwise, of: (1) The 
methodology and standards for 
determining the amount of payment 
under section 1814(l)(3) of the Act and 
payment adjustments under section 
1814(l)(4) of the Act; (2) the 
methodology and standards for 
determining a CAH to be a meaningful 
EHR user; (3) the methodology and 
standards for determining if the 
hardship exemption applies to a CAH; 
(4) the specification of EHR reporting 
periods; and (5) the identification of 
reasonable costs used to compute CAH 
incentive payments. 
d. Incentive Payment Calculation for 
CAHs 
Consistent with section 1814(l)(3)(A) 
of the Act, we proposed to amend 
§ 413.70(a) to add a new paragraph (5) 
to provide for an incentive payment to 
a qualifying CAH for the reasonable 
costs incurred for the purchase of 
certified EHR technology in a cost 
reporting period beginning during a 
payment year after FY 2010 but before 
FY 2016. We proposed to include a 
cross-reference to § 495.106 which 
defines the terms associated with the 
CAH incentive payment, including the 
definition of a ‘‘qualifying CAH’’ that is 
eligible to receive the CAH incentive 
payment, and the methodology for 
determining the amount of that 
incentive payment. In addition, we 
proposed to amend § 413.70(a) to add a 
new paragraph (6) to provide for the 
adjustment of a CAH’s reasonable costs 
of providing inpatient services starting 
in FY 2015 if the CAH is not a 
qualifying CAH. 
In computing the CAH incentive 
payment and applying the adjustments 
to a CAH’s payment if the CAH is not 
a qualifying CAH, we proposed to apply 
the definitions of certified EHR 
technology, EHR reporting period, 
meaningful EHR user and qualified EHR 
in § 495.4 that are discussed elsewhere 
in this final rule. 
In § 495.106(a), we proposed to define 
a qualifying CAH as a CAH that would 
meet the meaningful EHR user 
definition for eligible hospitals in 
§ 495.4, which is discussed in section II 
A.1. of this final rule if it were an 
eligible hospital. Also in § 495.106(a), 
for the purposes of computing the CAH 
incentive payment, we proposed that 
the reasonable costs for the purchase of 
certified EHR technology mean the 
reasonable acquisition costs, excluding 
any depreciation and interest expenses 
associated with the acquisition, 
incurred for the purchase of depreciable 
assets as described at part 413 subpart 
G, such as computers and associated 
hardware and software, necessary to 
administer certified EHR technology as 
defined in § 495.4 of this final rule. We 
also proposed to define payment year 
for CAHs to mean a fiscal year 
beginning after FY 2010 but before FY 
2016. 
Under proposed § 495.106(b), we 
specified that a qualifying CAH must 
receive an incentive payment for its 
reasonable costs incurred for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology. 
The CAH incentive payment will be for 
a cost reporting period that begins 
during a payment year after FY 2010 but 
before FY 2016. 
Consistent with section 1814(l)(3)(A) 
of the Act, we proposed under 
§ 495.106(c) that the payment 
methodology for computing the 
incentive payment for a qualifying CAH 
for a cost reporting period during a 
payment year would be equal to the 
product of—(1) the reasonable costs 
incurred for the purchase of certified 
EHR technology in that cost reporting 
period and any similarly incurred costs 
from previous cost reporting periods to 
the extent they have not been fully 
depreciated as of the cost reporting 
period involved and (2) the CAH’s 
Medicare share which equals the 
Medicare share as computed for eligible 
hospitals including the adjustment for 
charity care (described in sections 
II.A.2.b. and A.3. of this final rule) plus 
20 percentage points. However, in no 
case will the resulting Medicare share 
for a CAH exceed 100 percent. This 
payment methodology will be used in 
place of payment at 101 percent of 
reasonable costs typically applied under 
section 1814(l)(1) of the Act and 
§ 413.70(a)(1) of the regulations. 
For example, a CAH first requests an 
incentive payment for its cost reporting 
period beginning on January 1, 2012 
which is in FY 2012. The CAH incurred 
reasonable costs of $500,000 for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology in 
its previous cost reporting period 
beginning on January 1, 2011. This CAH 
is a meaningful user of certified EHR 
technology during the relevant EHR 
reporting period and thus qualifies for 
an incentive payment for FY 2012. (For 
illustrative purposes this example 
assumes no salvage value of the assets 
acquired.) The CAH depreciated 
$100,000 of the costs of these items in 
the cost reporting period beginning on 
January 1, 2011. As a result, the amount 
used to compute the incentive payment 
will be the remaining $400,000 of 
undepreciated costs. The CAH’s 
Medicare share is 90 percent (its 
Medicare share of 70 percent using the 
methodology described in section 
II.A.2.b. of this final rule plus 20 
percentage points). Therefore, the CAH’s 
incentive payment for FY 2012 is 
$360,000 ($400,000 times 90 percent). 
This CAH’s first payment year is FY 
2012, and it can receive incentive 
payments through 4 consecutive 
payment years which, in this example, 
would be FYs 2012 through 2015. 
If, in the above example, the CAH also 
incurred reasonable costs of $300,000 
for the purchase of certified EHR 
technology in its cost reporting period 
beginning in FY 2012 that will not be 
depreciated, then the incentive payment 
for FY 2012 is $630,000 ($700,000 
($400,000 in FY 2011 plus $300,000 in 
FY 2012) times 90 percent). 
(The preceding examples are offered for 
illustrative purposes only and are not 
intended to encompass all possible 
computations of the CAH incentive 
payment.) 
Under proposed § 495.106(d)(1), the 
amount of the incentive payment made 
to a qualifying CAH under this section 
represents the expensing and payment 
of the reasonable costs of certified EHR 
technology computed as described 
above in a single payment year and, as 
specified in § 413.70(a)(5), such 
payment is made in lieu of any payment 
that would have been made under 
§ 413.70(a)(1) for the reasonable costs of 
the purchase of certified EHR 
technology including depreciation and 
interest expenses associated with the 
acquisition. The Medicare contractor 
will review the CAH’s current year and 
each subsequent year’s cost report to

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
ensure that the assets associated with 
the acquisition of certified EHR 
technology are expensed in a single 
period and that depreciation and 
interest expenses associated with the 
acquisition are not allowed. 
Under proposed § 495.106(d)(2), the 
amount of the incentive payment made 
to a qualifying CAH under this section 
would be paid through a prompt interim 
payment for the applicable payment 
year after—(1) the CAH submits the 
necessary documentation, as specified 
by CMS or its Medicare contractor, to 
support the computation of the 
incentive payment amount; and (2) CMS 
or its Medicare contractor reviews such 
documentation and determines the 
interim amount of the incentive 
payment. 
Under proposed § 495.106(d)(3), the 
interim incentive payment would be 
subject to a reconciliation process as 
specified by CMS and the final 
incentive payment as determined by 
CMS or its Medicare contractor would 
be considered payment in full for the 
reasonable costs incurred for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology in 
a payment year. 
Under § 495.106(d)(4), we proposed 
that an incentive payment may be made 
with respect to a cost reporting period 
beginning during a payment year 
beginning with FY 2011 (October 1, 
2010 through September 30, 2011) 
through FY 2015 (October 1, 2014 
through September 30, 2015), but in no 
case may a CAH receive an incentive 
payment with respect to more than four 
consecutive payment years. Therefore, a 
CAH, that is a meaningful EHR user, 
may begin receiving an incentive 
payment for its cost reporting period 
beginning in FY 2011 for the incurred 
reasonable costs for the purchase of 
certified EHR technology during that 
cost reporting period and in previous 
cost reporting periods to the extent that 
the item or items have not been fully 
depreciated. These incentive payments 
will continue for no more than 4 
consecutive payment years and will not 
be made for a cost reporting period 
beginning during a payment year after 
2015. As discussed above and in section 
II.B.4. of this final rule, the CAH must 
submit supporting documentation for its 
incurred costs of purchasing certified 
EHR technology to its Medicare 
contractor (Fiscal Intermediary (FI)/ 
MAC). 
CAHs cannot receive an incentive 
payment for a cost reporting period that 
begins in a payment year after FY 2015. 
If the first payment year for a CAH is FY 
2013 then the fourth consecutive 
payment year would be 2016. However, 
the CAH cannot be paid an incentive 
payment for FYs 2016 and beyond. For 
FY 2016 and beyond, payment to CAHs 
for the purchase of additional EHR 
technology will be made under 
§ 413.70(a)(1) in accordance with the 
reasonable cost principles, as described 
above, which would include the 
depreciation and interest cost associated 
with such purchase. 
Comment: We received many 
comments requesting CMS to provide a 
list of those depreciable items that 
would be used to determine the CAH 
incentive payment under this provision. 
The commenters were concerned that 
certain expenses, such as staff training, 
associated with an EHR system may not 
be included in the CAH’s incentive 
payment. We also received comments 
requesting a further explanation of what 
documentation will be required to 
support the reasonable costs incurred by 
the CAH. 
Response: Section 1814(l)(3)(C) of the 
Act, as amended by the HITECH Act, 
provides that the costs for which a CAH 
may receive an incentive payment are 
reasonable costs for the purchase of 
certified EHR technology to which 
purchase depreciation (excluding 
interest) would otherwise apply under 
section 1814(l)(1) of the Act. 
Furthermore, section 1814(l)(3)(A) of the 
Act, as amended by the HITECH Act, 
mandates that the Secretary shall 
compute reasonable costs for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology by 
expensing such costs in a single 
payment year and not depreciating these 
costs over a period of years (and shall 
include as costs with respect to cost 
reporting periods beginning during a 
payment year costs from previous cost 
reporting periods to the extent they have 
not been fully depreciated as of the 
period involved). As described in the 
proposed rule, for the purposes of 
computing the CAH incentive payment, 
we proposed that the reasonable costs 
for the purchase of certified EHR 
technology mean the reasonable 
acquisition costs, excluding any 
depreciation and interest expenses 
associated with the acquisition, 
incurred for the purchase of depreciable 
assets as described at part 413 subpart 
G, such as computers and associated 
hardware and software, necessary to 
administer certified EHR technology as 
defined in § 495.4 of this final rule. 
CAHs will incur both depreciable and 
non-depreciable reasonable costs in a 
payment year that are associated with 
implementing and maintaining certified 
EHR technology. According to the 
statute, only the reasonable costs for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology to 
which purchase depreciation (excluding 
interest) would otherwise apply are to 
be included in the CAH incentive 
payment. Thus, CAHs will not have to 
depreciate these reasonable costs over 
the useful life of the EHR asset 
purchased as such costs will be 
expensed in a single payment year. Any 
non-depreciable reasonable costs 
incurred in that same single payment 
year that are associated with an EHR 
system may be paid for under the 
current Medicare reasonable cost 
payment system at 101 percent. 
Currently, the CAH’s Medicare 
contractor determines if an item 
purchased is a depreciable asset under 
Medicare principles or other accounting 
standards. The Medicare contractor also 
determines the CAH’s reasonable cost 
for acquiring depreciable assets. For the 
purposes of computing the CAH 
incentive payment, we are not changing 
the Medicare contractor’s current 
responsibilities described above. We, 
therefore, suggest that CAHs 
communicate with their Medicare 
contractors to determine the necessary 
documentation to support their 
reasonable costs incurred for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology 
and to determine if the items that they 
purchase are depreciable assets under 
Medicare principles or other accounting 
standards. 
Comment: We received some 
comments requesting clarification of 
how the incentive payments will be 
computed if an eligible CAH converts to 
or from an eligible ‘‘subsection d’’ 
hospital. 
Response: If during a payment year an 
eligible CAH is converted to or from a 
‘‘subsection d’’ hospital, the CAH may 
receive an incentive payment as long as 
it incurred the reasonable costs of 
purchasing certified EHR technology in 
a payment year (or in a previous cost 
reporting period) when it was a CAH 
and as long as the affected providers 
meet the meaningful use criteria 
described elsewhere in this final rule. 
When a conversion takes place, the 
affected CAH and ‘‘subsection d’’ 
hospital are each required to file a 
Medicare cost report under section 
413.24 of the regulations. For instance, 
if in month 6 of a cost reporting period 
that begins January 1, 2011 and ends 
December 31, 2011, a ‘‘subsection d’’ 
hospital converts to a CAH, the 
‘‘subsection d’’ hospital will file a 
terminating 6-month cost report 
(January 1, 2011 to June 30, 2011). If the 
CAH retains the same year end of 
December 31, 2011, the CAH will file a 
6-month cost report from July 1, 2011 to 
December 31, 2011. In this instance, the 
CAH’s 6-month cost report would be 
used to determine if it incurred 
reasonable costs for the purchase of

qualify for a CAH incentive payment 
during that period. The ‘‘subsection d’’ 
hospital’s 6 month terminating cost 
report would be used to determine the 
possible amount of any incentive 
payment for that eligible hospital. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, with the exception 
of a few minor, technical and 
conforming changes, we are finalizing 
the applicable provisions as proposed. 
Comment: We received many 
comments regarding the use of data 
from the revised Medicare cost report 
(Form CMS–2552–10) described in the 
proposed rule to compute the Medicare 
share portion of the CAH incentive 
payment. Commenters were also 
concerned that certain cost report data 
may not be available at the time of 
computing a CAH’s incentive payment. 
Response: As discussed elsewhere in 
this final rule, we are addressing 
concerns with data from the revised cost 
report in a final collection that is 
currently in the Paperwork Reduction 
Act clearance process. In addition, we 
address the timing issues with the 
revised cost report data elsewhere in 
this final rule. 
e. Reduction of Reasonable Cost 
Payment in FY 2015 and Subsequent 
Years for CAHs That Are Not 
Meaningful EHR Users 
Section 4102(b)(2) of the HITECH Act 
amends section 1814(l) to include an 
adjustment to a CAH’s reimbursement at 
101 percent of its reasonable costs if the 
CAH has not met the meaningful EHR 
user definition for an EHR reporting 
period that begins in FY 2015, FY 2016, 
FY 2017, and each subsequent FY 
thereafter. Consistent with this 
provision, we proposed that under 
§ 495.106(e) and § 413.70(a)(6), if a CAH 
has not demonstrated meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology for FY 2015, 
its reimbursement would be reduced 
from 101 percent of its reasonable costs 
to 100.66 percent. For FY 2016, its 
reimbursement would be reduced to 
100.33 percent of its reasonable costs. 
For FY 2017 and each subsequent FY, 
its reimbursement would be reduced to 
100 percent of reasonable costs. 
However, as provided for eligible 
hospitals, a CAH may, on a case-by-case 
basis, be exempted from this adjustment 
if CMS or its Medicare contractor 
determines, on an annual basis, that 
requiring the CAH to be a meaningful 
EHR user would result in a significant 
hardship, such as in the case of a CAH 
in a rural area without sufficient 
Internet access. However, in no case 
may a CAH be granted an exemption 
under this provision for more than 5 
years. 
Comment: We received some 
comments requesting further 
clarification of how CMS will be 
determining whether a significant 
hardship exists to warrant an 
exemption. 
Response: We received a few 
comments on this provision which is 
not effective until FY 2015. We will take 
these comments into account when we 
develop proposals for implementing this 
provision at a later date. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
sections 495.106(e) as proposed. We 
have renumbered proposed section 
413.70(a)(6)(iv) as 413.70(a)(7), but are 
otherwise finalizing section 413.70(a)(6) 
as proposed. 
Section 1814(l)(5) of the Act exempts 
the determinations made under 
paragraphs (l)(3) and (l)(4) from 
administrative and judicial review. 
Accordingly, under § 413.70(a)(6)(iv) 
and § 495.106(f), we proposed that there 
shall be no administrative or judicial 
review under sections 1869 or 1878 of 
the Act, or otherwise, of the following: 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining the amount of payment 
under section 1814(l)(3) of the Act and 
payment adjustments under section 
1814(l)(4) of the Act for CAHs, 
including selection of periods under 
section 1886(n)(2) of the Act for 
determining, and making estimates or 
using proxies of, inpatient-bed-days, 
hospital charges, charity charges, and 
the Medicare share under subparagraph 
(D) of section 1886(n)(2) of the Act; 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining a CAH to be a meaningful 
EHR user under section 1886(n)(3) of 
the Act as would apply if the CAH was 
treated as an eligible hospital under 
section 1886(n) of the Act; 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining if the hardship exemption 
under section 1814(l)(4)(C) of the Act 
applies to a CAH; 
• The specification of EHR reporting 
periods under section 1886(n)(6)(B) of 
the Act as applied under section 
1814(l)(3) and (4) of the Act for CAHs; 
and 
• The identification of reasonable 
costs used to compute the CAH 
incentive payment under section 
1814(l)(3)(C) of the Act. 
Comment: We received some 
comments requesting clarification of 
whether CAHs will be able to appeal 
their incentive payment amounts. 
Response: We believe that the 
limitation of administrative and judicial 
review does not apply to the amount of 
the CAH incentive payment. The CAH 
may appeal the statistical and financial 
amounts from the Medicare cost report 
used to determine the CAH incentive 
payment. The CAH would utilize the 
current provider appeal process 
pursuant to section 1878 of the Act. 
Accordingly, after consideration of 
the public comments received, we are 
finalizing § 495.106(f) as proposed. We 
have renumbered proposed 
§ 413.70(a)(6)(iv) as § 413.70(a)(7), but 
are otherwise finalizing the provision as 
proposed. 
4. Process for Making Incentive 
Payments Under the Medicare FFS 
Program 
As previously discussed in section 
II.B.1. and 2. of this final rule and 
sections 1848(o)(1) and 1886(n)(1) of the 
Act, the statute provides for incentive 
payments to eligible professionals, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHS who are 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology as early as FY 2011 for 
qualifying eligible hospitals and CAHs 
and CY 2011 for qualifying EPs. The 
statute does not specify the process for 
making these payments to qualifying 
EPs and qualifying eligible hospitals 
and CAHs participating in the FFS 
Medicare incentive payment program, 
but instead leaves the payment process 
to the Secretary’s discretion. 
We proposed that FIs, carriers, and 
MACs, as appropriate, would be 
responsible for determining the 
incentive payment amounts for 
qualifying EPs and qualifying eligible 
hospitals and CAHs in accordance with 
the methodology set forth in section 
II.B.1.b. and B.2.b. of this final rule 
based on the previously discussed 
meaningful use criteria, disbursing the 
incentive payments to qualifying EPs 
and qualifying eligible hospitals and 
CAHs, and resolving any reconciliation 
issues. 
a. Incentive Payments to EPs 
We proposed that the carriers/MACs 
calculate incentive payment amounts 
for qualifying EPs, where incentive 
payments would be disbursed on a 
rolling basis, as soon as they ascertained 
that an EP demonstrated meaningful use 
for the applicable reporting period (that 
is, 90 days for the first year or a calendar 
year for subsequent years), and reached 
the threshold for maximum payment. In 
accordance with section 1848(l)(3)(B) of 
the Act, we proposed that if a qualifying 
EP is not eligible for the maximum 
incentive payment amount for the 
payment year and if the qualifying EP 
was also a qualifying MA EP, the 
qualifying MA organization with which 
the EP is affiliated would receive the 
incentive payment for the EP through

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
the MA EHR incentive program. If the 
qualifying EP either does not also 
qualify as a MA EP or he or she qualifies 
as a MA EP but is not eligible for the 
maximum incentive payment for the 
payment year, we proposed that the 
carriers/MAC would calculate the 
amount of the qualifying EP’s incentive 
payment and disburse the incentive 
payment to the qualifying EP in the year 
following the payment year. The 
proposed rule also outlined that 
incentive payments would not be issued 
to qualifying EPs if an incentive 
payment was already made under the 
Medicaid program for the relevant 
payment year, and as required by 
section 1848(m)(2) of the Act as 
amended by section 4101(f) of the 
HITECH Act, qualifying EPs who 
received incentive payments from the 
Medicare EHR incentive payment 
program would not be eligible to receive 
an e-prescribing incentive payment. 
Additionally, we proposed that the 
incentive payments would be tracked at 
the qualifying EP’s TIN level, and 
disbursed to the TIN that the qualifying 
EP indicated during the registration 
process; qualifying EPs who do not have 
individual TINs (that is, a qualifying EP 
who works solely in a group practice) 
would be paid at the group practice 
level’s TIN. We proposed that qualifying 
EPs select one TIN for disbursement of 
their Medicare EHR incentive payment. 
Of course, after the payment is 
disbursed to their designated TIN, 
qualifying EPs may decide to allocate 
their incentive payment among the 
multiple practices in which they furnish 
covered professional services subject to 
applicable laws, regulations and rules, 
including, without limitation, those 
related to fraud, waste, and abuse. 
To be clear, we note that financial 
relationships, including those arising 
from the reallocation/reassignment of 
incentive payments, between physicians 
and their employers/other entities may 
implicate certain fraud, waste, and 
abuse laws, regulations, and rules. 
Therefore, we proposed to include 
specific safeguards to limit the risk that 
the allocation/reassignment of incentive 
payments could raise under those and 
other applicable laws, regulations and 
rules. Section II.B.1.d. above finalizes 
our proposal at § 495.10(f) to permit EPs 
to reassign their incentive payments to 
their employer or to an entity with 
which they have a contractual 
arrangement, consistent with all rules 
governing reassignments including part 
424, subpart F. 
Comment: Several commenters 
expressed concern that the proposed 
rule contained limited information on 
how the incentive program for Medicare 
EPs will be operationalized. They 
requested additional information on the 
expected timeframe and process for 
payments. 
Response: The HITECH Act requires 
that EHR incentive program payments 
be separately tracked and monitored 
because these funds cannot be 
commingled with other Medicare funds. 
Therefore, to facilitate funds control, 
payments will be made through a single 
payment contractor rather than through 
the carriers/MACs as was originally 
proposed. Additionally, the Integrated 
Data Repository (IDR), rather than the 
carriers/MACs, will be accumulating the 
allowed charges for each qualified EP’s 
NPI. Payments would be made on a 
rolling basis, as soon as we ascertain 
that an EP has successfully 
demonstrated meaningful use for the 
applicable reporting period (that is, 90 
days for the first year or a calendar year 
for subsequent years) and the EP’s 
allowed charges has reached the 
threshold that qualifies an EP for 
maximum incentive payment, for the 
relevant payment year. Once this 
determination has been made, the 
National Level Repository (NLR) will 
calculate the EP’s incentive payment. 
The payment will then be made by the 
single payment contractor. We 
anticipate that it will take anywhere 
from 15 to 46 days from the time an EP 
successfully attests to being a 
meaningful user to the time an incentive 
payment is made, and that for FY 2011, 
incentive payments will be made to EPs 
who successfully demonstrate that they 
were meaningful EHR users for the EHR 
reporting period (that is, 90 days) as 
early as May 2011. As proposed, we will 
pay a qualifying EP a single 
consolidated incentive payment for a 
payment year, rather than make periodic 
installment payments. In order to 
accommodate different attestation dates 
throughout the first year for EPs, our 
payment cycle is on a monthly basis as 
previously described; however, 
qualifying EPs will receive one single 
payment per year. In other words, CMS 
will issue payments as soon as possible 
after a qualifying EP attested to 
meaningfully using a certified EHR 
system, hence the monthly payment 
cycle; however, an EP will only receive 
one incentive payment for each year 
he/she qualifies. For qualifying EPs 
whose allowed charges for the payment 
year do not reach the maximum 
thresholds, the single payment 
contractor will disburse an incentive 
payment in the following year. 
Comment: One commenter 
recommended CMS make semi-annual 
incentive payments for the second and 
subsequent payment years to ensure 
physician practices have cash flow to 
deploy certified EHR systems and train 
employees how to use the systems. 
Response: When the EHR reporting 
period is a full year, no EPs will have 
successfully demonstrated that they are 
meaningful users at the mid-year mark. 
Therefore, as previously described, 
qualifying Medicare EPs will receive a 
single payment per year, issued on a 
monthly payment cycle. We intend to 
finalize this provision as proposed; 
there will be a single successful 
attestation per year and a single 
payment following the attestation for 
qualifying EPs. 
Comment: One commenter questioned 
whether the scopes of work for the 
MACs/Medicare Carriers would be 
revised to reflect the additional work 
that this program will entail. 
Response: As previously discussed in 
the first comment and response, the 
IDR, rather than the MACs/Medicare 
Carriers, will accumulate the EPs 
allowed charges. The MAC/Carrier work 
related the Medicare EHR incentive 
program will be within their current 
scope of work and will be handled 
through the normal change request 
process. 
Comment: One commenter believes 
an EP’s program selection (Medicare or 
Medicaid) is tied to the TIN where the 
EP assigns incentive payments. The 
commenter recommended CMS permit 
additional changes in program selection 
if EPs change their TIN. The commenter 
believes allowing only one program 
change in the life of the program is too 
restricting given that patient mix might 
change due to a practice being 
purchased by another TIN or an EP 
becoming a part-time employee of 
another TIN. 
Response: Section II.A.5.b. of this 
final rule outlines our policy decision 
around changing program selections. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
our policy as proposed. For purposes of 
this provision, payments will be made 
through a single payment contractor 
with the IDR accumulating the allowed 
charges for each qualified EP’s NPI. 
Payments will be made on a rolling 
basis, as soon as we ascertain that an EP 
has successfully demonstrated 
meaningful use for the applicable 
reporting period (that is, 90 days for the 
first year or a calendar year for 
subsequent years), and reached the 
threshold for maximum payment then 
the NLR will calculate the incentive 
payment. We estimate it will take 
anywhere from 15 to 46 days from the 
time an EP successfully attests to being 
a meaningful user to the time an 
incentive payment is made.

b. Incentive Payments to Eligible 
Hospitals 
We proposed that the FIs/MACs 
would calculate incentive payments for 
qualifying eligible hospitals, and would 
disburse such payments on an interim 
basis once the hospital has 
demonstrated it is a meaningful EHR 
user for the EHR reporting period for the 
payment year. As discussed above in 
section B.2.b. of the final rule, the 
formula for calculating a qualifying 
eligible hospital’s incentive payment 
requires the following data: (1) An 
initial amount; (2) the Medicare share; 
and (3) a transition factor applicable to 
that payment year. We proposed that 
FIs/MACs would use the prior-year cost 
report, Provider Statistical and 
Reimbursement (PS&R) System data, 
and other estimates to calculate the 
interim incentive payment. As 
discussed in section II.B.2.c. of this final 
rule, beginning in 2010, cost reports will 
capture charity care data which will be 
used in calculating the Medicare share 
of the payment. We proposed that the 
MACs/FIs calculate a qualifying 
hospital’s final incentive payment using 
data from the cost report for the 
hospital’s fiscal year that ends during 
the FY prior to the FY that serves as the 
payment year. We also proposed that 
the FIs/MACs calculate the final 
incentive payment using actual cost 
report data report for the hospital’s 
fiscal year that ends during the FY prior 
to the fiscal year that serves as the 
payment year, and would reconcile the 
incentive payment as necessary at 
settlement of the cost report. 
Additionally, incentive payments for 
qualifying eligible hospitals would be 
calculated based on the provider 
number used for cost reporting 
purposes, which is the CCN of the main 
provider. Therefore, incentive payments 
for qualifying hospitals would be 
disbursed to the CCN rather than the 
TIN. 
Comment: Several commenters 
expressed concern that the proposed 
rule contained limited information on 
how the incentive program for hospitals 
will be operationalized. They requested 
additional information on the expected 
timeframe and process for payments as 
well as requesting clarification that the 
incentive payments would be 
distributed as a ‘‘lump sum payment.’’ 
One commenter requested CMS 
disburse one lump sum payment at the 
start of each eligible year for those 
hospitals that meet all of the meaningful 
use requirements. 
Response: Hospital EHR incentive 
payments will be calculated by the FIs/ 
MACs; however, to facilitate funds 
control, payments will be made through 
a single payment contractor. We will 
direct the payment contractor to issue to 
qualifying hospitals, that is those 
hospitals who successfully demonstrate 
that they are meaningful EHR users, a 
single initial payment for the year. We 
anticipate that payments will be made 
to qualifying Medicare hospitals 
beginning in May 2011. No payment 
will be made prior to an eligible 
Medicare hospital successfully 
demonstrating that it was a meaningful 
EHR user during the EHR period for the 
relevant payment year. For purposes of 
determining interim incentive 
payments, we will employ data on the 
hospital’s Medicare fee-for-service and 
managed care inpatient bed days, total 
inpatient bed-days, and charges for 
charity care from a hospital’s most 
recently submitted 12-month cost report 
once the hospital has qualified as a 
meaningful user. For purposes of 
determining final incentive payments, 
we will employ the first 12-month cost 
reporting period that begins after the 
start of the payment year, in order to 
settle payments on the basis of the 
hospital’s Medicare fee-for-service and 
managed care inpatient bed days, total 
inpatient bed-days, and charges for 
charity care data from that cost 
reporting period. 
Comment: One commenter requested 
that CMS allow hospitals to make an 
interim attestation 90 days after the start 
of the second and subsequent payment 
years. They suggested the interim 
attestation would note that they are in 
compliance with the meaningful use 
rules and intend to remain in 
compliance. They requested that CMS 
instruct the contractor to issue interim 
EHR payments after receipt of such 
attestation. The commenter believes this 
would cut down on the time frame of 21 
months between their first and second 
hospital interim payments. 
Response: The reporting period 
requirements for a hospital’s second and 
subsequent years are 365 days. Due to 
the year-long reporting period, we do 
not believe we can allow for an interim 
attestation that the provider is a 
meaningful EHR user. Under our 
definitions at § 495.4, a provider is not 
a meaningful EHR user unless it has ‘‘for 
an EHR reporting period for a payment 
year,’’ demonstrated meaningful use ‘‘in 
accordance with § 495.8 by meeting the 
applicable objectives and associated 
measures under § 495.6.’’ Thus, we 
could not determine that the provider is 
a meaningful user at an interim point in 
time, and there would be no basis for 
providing the interim payment. 
Comment: One commenter expressed 
confusion over the term ‘‘demonstration 
period’’ and questioned if a hospital had 
to complete the full demonstration 
period before payments would be made. 
Response: We assume the commenter 
means EHR ‘‘reporting period’’ when 
using the phrase, ‘‘demonstration 
period.’’ A hospital must demonstrate 
that it met the requirements for 
meaningful use for the full EHR 
reporting period for the relevant 
payment year before we will direct the 
payment contractor to issue an incentive 
payment to the hospital for the payment 
year. A hospital therefore must 
complete the full EHR reporting period 
before demonstrating that it was a 
meaningful EHR user and before any 
payments would be made. 
Comment: Several commenters 
recommended that CMS’ payment 
process for eligible hospitals be 
consistent with its payment process for 
EPs, and that hospital’s initial incentive 
payment thus be distributed no later 
than two months after the hospital 
successfully demonstrates meaningful 
use. The same commenters requested 
CMS specify that the final incentive 
payment be issued no later than two 
months after the hospital submits its 
cost report from the FY that ends during 
the payment year. 
Response: We anticipate that for FY 
2011, interim incentive payments will 
be made to eligible hospitals that 
successfully demonstrate that they were 
meaningful EHR users for the EHR 
reporting period for FY 2011 (that is, 90 
days) as early as May 2011. The exact 
timing of when a qualifying eligible 
hospital receives its interim incentive 
payment will depend on when the 
hospital successfully demonstrates that 
it was a meaningful EHR user; the 
sooner a hospital successfully 
demonstrate that is was a meaningful 
EHR user during the EHR reporting 
period for the payment year, the sooner 
it will receive its interim incentive 
payment. For a Medicare hospital’s 
second and subsequent participation 
years, after a hospital successfully 
demonstrates that it was a meaningful 
EHR user during the EHR reporting 
period (that is, the federal fiscal year) 
for the payment year, the hospital will 
receive the interim incentive payment 
in the following year; the initial 
incentive payments will be made on a 
monthly payment cycle beginning 
shortly after the hospital is determined 
to be a meaningful user. To the 
commenters’ point of requesting that we 
be consistent with the approach to 
paying EPs, there seems to be confusion 
around what was proposed as to the 
timing and distribution of the EP’s 
incentive payment. The proposal for the 
EP’s incentive payment was that EP’s

accumulated allowed charges would be 
based on claims submitted not later than 
two months after the end of the payment 
year. The incentive payment for a 
qualifying EP’s second and subsequent 
payment years was always to be 
disbursed in the year following the 
payment year. We did not propose 
paying an EP within two months of 
being deemed a meaningful user. 
Comment: Several commenters 
questioned how CMS would treat a 
hospital that qualified for an incentive 
payment one year, but did not qualify 
the next or subsequent years; what is the 
impact on the stream of incentive 
payments to the hospital? 
Response: An eligible hospital’s first 
payment year is the first year they 
successfully demonstrate that they were 
a meaningful EHR user for the EHR 
reporting period for the payment year. 
Section 1886(n)(2)(G) of the Act defines 
the second through fifth payment years 
for a hospital as each successive year 
immediately following the first payment 
year for such hospital. An eligible 
hospital’s second payment year, then, is 
the year following its first payment year, 
regardless of whether the eligible 
hospital qualifies for an incentive 
payment in the year following its first 
payment year. Similarly, an eligible 
hospital’s third, fourth, and fifth 
payment year are the third, fourth, and 
fifth years, respectively, following the 
hospital’s first payment year, even if the 
hospital does not receive an incentive 
payment for one or more of those years. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that CMS clarify that EHR 
incentive payments for which a hospital 
qualifies or receives under the EHR 
incentive program (whether directly or 
pursuant to an assignment, 
reassignment or other transfer) shall not 
affect or be taken into account in the 
calculation or other payments made to 
the eligible hospital under Medicare, 
Medicaid, or any other state or federal 
healthcare program, such as 
disproportionate share payments, 
graduate medical education and indirect 
medical education payments, and 
payments for un-compensated care 
payments. 
Response: EHR incentive payments 
will have no bearing on the hospital’s 
Medicare disproportionate share, 
indirect medical education or direct 
graduate medical education payments. 
This discussion is also addressed in the 
Medicaid section at II.D.4.b. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
our policy as proposed. For purposes of 
this provision, Hospital incentive 
payments will be calculated by the FIs/ 
MACs; however, to facilitate funds 
control, payments will be made through 
a single payment contractor. We will 
direct the payment contractor to issue to 
qualifying hospitals a single initial 
payment per year, and expect initial 
payment may begin as early as May 
2011, for those who demonstrate they 
are meaningful EHR users at the earliest 
date possible. We estimate it will take 
anywhere from 15 to 46 days from the 
time a hospital successfully attests to 
being a meaningful user to the time an 
incentive payment is made. 
c. Incentive Payments to CAHs 
In the proposed rule, CMS proposed 
that because CAHs are paid on a cost 
reimbursement basis once a CAH incurs 
actual EHR costs, it could submit 
supporting documentation to the FI/ 
MAC for review. The FIs/MACs would 
determine an incentive payment 
amount, as discussed in section II.A.3 of 
the proposed rule by substituting for the 
Medicare share amount that would 
otherwise be applied under the formula 
used for computing payments for 
eligible hospitals, a percent (not to 
exceed 100 percent) equal to the sum 
of—(1) the Medicare share for such 
CAH, and (2) 20 percentage points. 
As discussed in the proposed rule, the 
FIs/MACs would reconcile the cost 
report and ensure the EHR expenses are 
adjusted on the cost report to avoid 
duplicate payments. Incentive payments 
for qualifying CAHs would be 
calculated based on the provider 
number used for cost reporting 
purposes, which is the CCN number of 
the main provider. Therefore, incentive 
payments for qualifying CAHs would be 
based on the CCN rather than the TIN. 
Comment: Several commenters 
expressed concern that the proposed 
rule contained limited information on 
how the incentive program would be 
operationalized for CAHs. They 
requested additional information on the 
expected timeframe and process for 
payments to CAHs. 
Response: To facilitate funds control, 
payments will be made through a single 
payment contractor. In order to receive 
a HITECH incentive payment, a CAH 
will have to attest that it is a meaningful 
user, and submit documentation to its 
FI/MAC to support the costs incurred 
for its HIT system. Once the FI/MAC 
reviews the documentation and the 
allowable amount is determined, we 
will direct the payment contractor to 
release to the CAH a single incentive 
payment in the next HITECH payment 
cycle. Payment cycles will begin in May 
2011. 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested more information on the 
timing of the distribution of payments to 
CAHs once the necessary 
documentation has been submitted and 
that recommended CMS be consistent 
with its proposal on incentive payments 
for EPs and specify that the CAH’s 
initial incentive payment will be 
distributed no later than two months 
after it submits the necessary 
documentation. The same commenters 
requested that CMS specify that the 
final incentive payment be issued no 
later than two months after the CAH 
submits its cost report. 
Response: CAHs will receive a single 
initial incentive payment per year with 
the initial payments beginning in May 
2011. Once the FIs/MACs review the 
documentation and the allowable 
amount is determined, we will direct 
the payment contractor to release a 
single incentive payment in the next 
incentive payment cycle to qualifying 
CAHs. We anticipate the initial 
payments will generally be made within 
two months of the determination of the 
allowable amount. The final payment 
will be calculated on the cost report, 
and the process to settle the cost report 
will not be modified for these incentive 
payments. It will continue to follow the 
normal final settlement process. For the 
CAHs’ second and subsequent 
participation years, CAHs will also 
receive a single initial incentive 
payment per year and a final incentive 
payment as described above. With 
respect to the commenters’ request that 
we be consistent with the proposed 
approach to paying EPs, there seems to 
be confusion around what was proposed 
as to the timing and distribution of 
incentive payments to EPs. The 
proposal for EP incentive payments was 
that an EP’s accumulated allowed 
charges would be based on claims 
submitted not later than two months 
after the end of the payment year. The 
incentive payment for a qualifying EP’s 
second and subsequent payment years 
was always to be disbursed in the year 
following the payment year. We did not 
propose to make incentive payments to 
an EP within two months of the EP 
being deemed a meaningful user. 
Comment: Several commenters 
questioned what is considered 
‘‘necessary documentation’’ for CAHs to 
submit in order to receive Medicare 
CAH incentive payments. The same 
commenters requested CMS propose 
and obtain comments on ‘‘necessary 
documentation’’ and finalize a rule 
before FY 2011. 
Response: The documentation 
submitted should include information 
reflecting what was purchased, and 
support the costs incurred. Such 
documentation may include invoices, 
receipts, or other comparable materials.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Comment: One commenter 
recommended CMS (not the MACs/FIs) 
should make all determinations 
regarding CAHs. 
Response: The documentation review 
process for Medicare CAH incentive 
payments is similar to processes 
currently performed by FIs/MACs. Also, 
the data needed to calculate the 
Medicare Share is on the cost reports, 
which are submitted to the FIs/MACs. 
Accordingly, we believe it would be 
most appropriate for the payment 
determinations be made by the FIs/ 
MACs, and not by CMS. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
our policy as proposed. For purposes of 
this provision, CAH payments will be 
calculated by the FIs/MACs; however, 
as discussed above, to facilitate funds 
control, payments will be made through 
a single payment contractor. Once the 
FIs/MACs review the documentation 
and the allowable amount is 
determined, we will direct the payment 
contractor to release to the CAH a single 
incentive payment in the next HITECH 
payment cycle. Payment cycles will 
begin in May 2011. 
d. Payment Accounting Under Medicare 
We will conduct selected compliance 
reviews of EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
qualified CAHs who register for the 
incentive programs and of recipients of 
incentive payments for the meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology. The 
reviews will validate provider eligibility 
through their meaningful use 
attestations including verification of 
meaningful use and would also review 
components of the payment formulas. 
We will identify and recoup 
overpayments made under the incentive 
payment programs that result from 
incorrect or fraudulent attestations, 
quality measures, cost data, patient data, 
or any other submission required to 
establish eligibility or to qualify for a 
payment. The overpayment will be 
recouped by CMS or its agents from the 
EP, eligible hospital, MA organization, 
CAH, other entities to whom the right to 
payment has been assigned/reassigned, 
or, in the case of Medicaid, from the 
State Medicaid agencies. Medicare FFS 
EPs and eligible hospitals will need to 
maintain evidence of qualification to 
receive incentive payments for 10 years 
after the date they register for the 
incentive program. 
5. Preclusion of Administrative and 
Judicial Review 
We did not discuss preclusion of 
administrative and judicial review in 
our proposed rule. We are now 
including a discussion, in order to make 
the public aware of the preclusion. Also, 
the sections of this final rule discussing 
payments to Medicare Advantage (MA) 
organizations and CAHs both include a 
description of the preclusion, as well as 
accompanying regulation text. 
Therefore, while we believe statutory 
provisions on preclusion of review are 
self-implementing, below, we include a 
discussion of the preclusion of review 
that applies to EPs and eligible 
hospitals. We have also added 
regulation text to maintain consistency 
with the CAH and MA organization 
provisions. 
For EPs, section 1848(o)(3)(C) of the 
Act prohibits administrative or judicial 
review under section 1869, section 
1878, or otherwise, of all of the 
following: 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining EP incentive payment 
amounts. 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining the payment adjustments 
that apply to EPs beginning with 2015. 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining whether an EP is a 
meaningful EHR user, including: (1) The 
selection of clinical quality measures; 
and (2) the means of demonstrating 
meaningful EHR use. 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining the hardship exception to 
the payment adjustments. 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining whether an EP is hospital- 
based. 
• The specification of the EHR 
reporting period, as well as whether 
payment will be made only once, in a 
single consolidated payment, or in 
periodic installments. 
For eligible hospitals, section 
1886(n)(4)(A) of the Act similarly 
prohibits administrative or judicial 
review under section 1869, section 
1878, or otherwise, of the following: 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining the incentive payment 
amounts made to eligible hospitals, 
including: (1) The estimates or proxies 
for determining discharges, inpatient- 
bed-days, hospital charges, charity 
charges, and Medicare share; and (2) the 
period used to determine such estimate 
or proxy. 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining the payment adjustments 
that apply to eligible hospitals 
beginning with FY 2015. 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining whether an eligible 
hospital is a meaningful EHR user, 
including: (1) The selection of clinical 
quality measures; and (2) the means of 
demonstrating meaningful EHR use. 
• The methodology and standards for 
determining the hardship exception to 
the payment adjustments. 
• The specification of the EHR 
reporting period, as well as whether 
payment will be made only once, in a 
single consolidated payment, or in 
periodic installments. 
We note that the above listing may 
summarize or abbreviate portions of the 
statute. For precise language on the 
preclusion of judicial review, readers 
should always refer to the statute. 
C. Medicare Advantage (MA) 
Organization Incentive Payments 
1. Definitions 
a. Qualifying MA Organization 
Section 1853(l)(1) of the Act, as added 
by section 4101(c) of the HITECH Act, 
provides for incentive payments to 
qualifying MA organizations for certain 
of their affiliated EPs who are 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology during the relevant EHR 
reporting period for a payment year. 
Section 1853(l)(5) of the Act defines the 
term ‘‘qualifying MA organization’’ as an 
MA organization that is organized as a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) 
as defined in section 2791(b)(3) of the 
PHS Act. Section 2791(b)(3) of the PHS 
Act in turn defines a health 
maintenance organization as a federally 
qualified HMO, an organization 
recognized as an HMO under State law, 
or a similar organization regulated for 
solvency under State law in the same 
manner and to the same extent as an 
HMO. Since there are few federally 
qualified HMOs, we expect MA 
organizations to primarily qualify for 
incentive payments as State-licensed 
HMOs, or as organizations regulated for 
solvency under State law in the same 
manner and to the same extent as 
HMOs. 
In § 495.200 we proposed to define 
‘‘qualifying MA organization.’’ 
Specifically, in § 495.202(a)(2), we 
proposed to deem MA organizations 
offering MA HMO plans that are not 
federally-qualified HMOs to meet the 
definition of HMO in section 2791(b)(3) 
of the PHS Act, as HMOs recognized 
under State law, or as entities subject to 
State solvency rules in the same manner 
as HMOs. We believe this is reasonable 
because under the MA application 
process, State regulators are required to 
certify that MA organizations operating 
in their State are authorized to offer the 
type of MA plan they proposed to offer, 
and meet solvency standards that are 
adequate for these purposes. For each 
MA organization offering MA HMO 
plans, the State has thus recognized that 
the organization is able to assume risk

 44469 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
as an HMO. Therefore, we have 
determined that absent evidence to the 
contrary, an MA organization offering 
HMO plans is recognized by the State as 
a health maintenance organization, or 
that it is subject to State solvency 
standards in the same manner and to the 
same extent as an HMO and therefore 
provides sufficient assurance that the 
section 2791(b)(3) of the PHS Act 
definition is met. 
In § 495.202(a)(3), for MA 
organizations that offer other 
coordinated care MA plans (Preferred 
Provider Organization (PPO) plans, 
Provider Sponsored Organization (PSO) 
plans, and Regional Preferred Provider 
Organization (RPPO) plans) and for 
other MA organizations offering other 
MA plan types (private fee-for-service 
(PFFS) plans, Medical Savings Account 
(MSA) plans), we proposed that the 
sponsoring MA organization would be 
required to attest that the MA 
organization is recognized under State 
law as an HMO, or that it is a similar 
organization regulated under State law 
for solvency in the same manner and to 
the same extent as an HMO before we 
would make a determination that the 
MA organization is a qualifying MA 
organization for purposes of incentive 
payments. 
Although we did not receive any 
comments on these provisions and are 
finalizing them as proposed, there is one 
exception. In order to bring 422.202(a) 
into conformance with the change we 
are making to 422.202(b)(1), we are 
changing the date by which MAOs are 
required to identify themselves to us 
from the bidding deadline in June 2010 
(for plan year 2011) to the bidding 
deadline in June 2011 (for plan year 
2012). 
b. Qualifying MA Eligible Professional 
(EP) 
A qualifying MA organization may 
receive an incentive payment only for 
those EPs described under section 
1853(l)(2) of the Act, as added by 
section 4101(c) of the HITECH Act. 
Section 1853(l)(2) of the Act provides 
that MA EPs must be ‘‘eligible 
professionals’’ as defined under section 
1848(o) of the Act as added by section 
4101(a) of the HITECH Act, and must 
either— 
• Be employed by the qualifying MA 
organization; or 
• Be employed by, or be a partner of, 
an entity that through contract with the 
qualifying MA organization furnishes at 
least 80 percent of the entity’s Medicare 
patient care services to enrollees of the 
qualifying MA organization. 
Further, the EP must furnish at least 80 
percent of his or her professional 
services covered under Title XVIII 
(Medicare) to enrollees of the qualifying 
MA organization and must furnish, on 
average, at least 20 hours per week of 
patient care services. 
As discussed in section II.A.1. of this 
final rule, an EP is defined as a 
physician (under section 1861(r) of the 
Act). 
We said we interpreted ‘‘employed 
by’’ to mean that the EP is considered an 
employee of a qualifying MA 
organization or qualifying entity under 
the usual common law rules applicable 
in determining the employer-employee 
relationship under section 3121(d)(2) of 
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. 
We said we interpreted ‘‘to be a 
partner of’’ to mean that the qualifying 
MA EP has an ownership stake in the 
entity. Under this interpretation, a 
professional that contracts with an 
entity, but who has no ownership stake 
in the entity, would not be considered 
a qualifying MA EP. 
We said we interpreted ‘‘furnishing at 
least 80 percent’’ of the entity’s ‘‘patient 
care services’’ to enrollees of the 
organization to mean at least 80 percent 
of the qualifying entity’s total Medicare 
revenue in a year (that is, total revenue 
from Medicare FFS as well as from all 
MA organizations) must be from a single 
qualifying MA organization. 
We proposed to interpret the 
requirement that a qualifying MA EP 
furnish at least 80 percent of their 
professional services covered under 
Title XVIII to enrollees of the 
organization to mean that at least 80 
percent of the professional’s total 
Medicare revenue in a year (that is, total 
revenue from Medicare FFS as well as 
from all MA organizations) must be 
from a single qualifying MA 
organization. We said we believed that 
in establishing the rule that qualifying 
MA EPs need to furnish at least 80 
percent of their Title XVIII covered 
services ‘‘to enrollees of the 
organization,’’ the statute limits payment 
related to any specific qualifying MA EP 
to a single qualifying MA organization. 
Thus, if a qualifying MA EP provided an 
average of 20 hours per week of patient 
care services to two distinct qualifying 
MA organizations, we said we would 
pay the qualifying MA organization for 
the MA EP only if such a qualifying EP 
provided at least 80 percent of his or her 
professional services covered under 
Title XVIII to enrollees of that 
organization. 
For purposes of determining whether 
a qualifying MA EP furnishes, on 
average, at least 20 hours per week of 
patient care services, we interpreted the 
requirement to include both Medicare 
and non-Medicare patient care services. 
Moreover, we proposed that the relevant 
time period for determining whether an 
MA EP furnishes at least 20 hours per 
week of patient care services should be 
the EHR reporting period. (We discuss 
the definition of EHR reporting period 
in section II.A.1.e. of this final rule.) 
Therefore, we said that over the EHR 
reporting period, the qualifying MA EP 
must provide on average 20 hours per 
week of patient care services. Finally, 
we interpreted ‘‘patient care services’’ to 
mean services that would be considered 
‘‘covered professional services’’ under 
sections 1848(o)(5)(A) and (k)(3) of the 
Act. That is, health care services for 
which payment would be made under, 
or for which payment would be based 
on, the fee schedule established under 
Medicare Part B if they were furnished 
by an eligible professional to a Medicare 
beneficiary. 
We considered various methods of 
determining when at least 20 hour per 
week, on average, of patient care 
services would be considered to be 
provided by MA EPs. We considered 
methods such as defining a dollar or 
service threshold, or the number of 
hours of direct patient care services 
actually provided. After due 
consideration we proposed to require 
qualifying MA organizations to attest to 
the fact that MA EPs for whom they are 
requesting EHR incentive payments 
have provided, on average, 20 hours of 
patient care services during the EHR 
reporting period. 
Comment: A few commenters 
referenced the Report to Congress 
required by section 4101(d) of the 
HITECH Act. The commenters suggested 
ways in which we could combine 
original FFS Medicare claims-payment 
data and MA services provided by EPs 
in order to arrive at a single, combined 
EHR payment. One commenter asked 
whether payments to a provider from a 
Medicare Advantage plan can contribute 
to the volume of Allowed Charges for 
the purpose of calculating maximum 
Meaningful Use rewards, saying that he 
believed that they should. Another 
commenter said that a substantial 
percentage of senior citizens receive 
their care from EPs providing services 
by way of Medicare Advantage plans. 
The commenter continued that current 
proposed rules provide incentive 
payment only to EPs in whose practices 
80 percent or more of total services are 
to Medicare Advantage patients. The 
commenter concluded that this would 
exclude many EPs treating our most 
vulnerable citizens from the opportunity 
to meaningfully adopt EHRs in their 
practices and that the 80 percent [MA] 
practice requirement should be 
eliminated. Other commenters argued

srobinson on DSKHWCL6B1PROD with RULES2
 44470 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
that the regulation was unclear 
regarding an exclusion of covered 
professional services of an EP not 
employed by an MAO when 
determining their participation or level 
of payment because those services are 
provided to MA beneficiaries. The 
commenter believed that the Secretary 
should provide a mechanism, whereby 
EPs can supplement their record to the 
appropriate carrier/MAC with their MA 
charges. 
Response: We do not have statutory 
authority to combine payments across 
the FFS and MA EHR incentive 
payment programs. The statutory 
provision at section 1853(l)(3)(B) of the 
Act, as added by section 4101 of the 
HITECH, entitled ‘‘Avoiding Duplication 
of Payments,’’ specifically prohibits us 
from making payments to EPs for both 
FFS and MA services. Additionally, had 
Congress wanted CMS to combine FFS 
and MA charges it could have included 
a provision similar to the provision in 
section 1886(n)(2)(D)(i) of the Act, as 
added by section 4102(a) of the HITECH 
Act, where FFS and MA inpatient-bed- 
days are added together to derive the 
numerator of the Medicare share 
fraction. We do not have the authority 
to eliminate the requirement that an EP 
provide 80 percent of Medicare services 
to enrollees of an MA organization, as 
that requirement is set forth in section 
1853(l)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Act, as added 
by the HITECH Act, which is clear in 
requiring that an MA EP provide ‘‘80 
percent of * * * professional services 
* * * covered under this title to 
enrollees of the [MA] organization.’’ 
Comment: One commenter 
recommended that CMS retain its 
proposal regarding how the 80 percent 
and the 20 hours per week criteria will 
be met by MA EPs. Another commenter 
said that many EPs in Puerto Rico 
would not qualify for incentives under 
this test. The commenter said that the 
single MA organization requirement of 
80 percent revenue and 20 hours per 
week for MA EPs would not be met due 
to the competition and market changes 
from year to year. The commenter 
suggested eliminating the single MA 
organization requirement. Instead, the 
commenter said we should change the 
standards to consider all enrollees of all 
MA organizations to which an EP 
furnishes services. The commenter 
continued by saying that if the 
requirements are not modified to accept 
multiple MA organizations, the 
commenter anticipated several 
unintended consequences in the Puerto 
Rico market. First, the commenter said, 
it would be impossible for providers to 
meet the single MA organization 
requirement of 80 percent revenue and 
20 hours per week, and therefore, the 
standard would create disinterest in 
adopting EHRs in their practice. Second, 
the commenter said, the single MA 
organization requirement standard 
would stymie competition. An 
unanticipated consequence of the 
requirement would be providers 
dropping out of MA plans to consolidate 
revenue in order to meet the standard 
from a single MA organization. Third, 
the commenter concluded, patients 
would have fewer options to select 
among MA plans, and to a lesser degree, 
MA enrollees might be forced to 
discontinue care with long time MA 
providers in light of the providers’ 
determination to consolidate revenue 
under a single MA organization. 
Response: As noted above, the 80 
percent of Medicare revenue standard is 
set forth in the statute, and may not be 
changed by regulation. The 20 hour per 
week rule is also statutory and based on 
section 1853(l)(2)(B) of the Act, as 
added by the HITECH Act. We note, 
however, that it is not the case that all 
20 hours of patient care services per 
week be provided by an EP to MA 
enrollees of a single MA organization. 
Rather, the 20 hours of patient care 
services to enrollees of a single MA 
organization can include both Medicare 
and non-Medicare services and patients. 
Comment: One commenter asked 
CMS to continue to work with Congress 
to develop an equitable mechanism by 
which to provide incentives to 
physicians that provide health care 
services through participation with 
more than one MAO. 
Response: As previously mentioned 
in the preamble to this final rule, the 
statute clearly limits payment related to 
any specific MA EP to a single 
qualifying MA organization. Potential 
changes in the statute are outside the 
scope of this rulemaking. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are 
implementing the foregoing provisions 
as proposed. 
As discussed in section II.B. of this 
final rule relating to Medicare FFS EPs, 
a qualifying MA EP is also defined as a 
physician under section 1861(r) of the 
Act. Section 1853(l)(1) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(c) of the HITECH 
Act, provides that the provisions of 
sections 1848(o) and 1848(a)(7) of the 
Act, as amended and added by sections 
4101(a) and (b) of the HITECH Act, 
respectively, which establish the 
incentive payments for EPs under 
Medicare FFS, apply to a qualifying MA 
organization’s qualifying MA EPs ‘‘in a 
similar manner’’ as they apply to EPs 
under Medicare FFS. As discussed 
above in section II.A.6. of this final rule, 
section 1848(o)(1)(C)(i) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(a) of the HITECH 
Act, states that hospital-based EPs are 
not eligible for incentive payments. 
Therefore, we proposed that, similar to 
the Medicare FFS incentive program, 
MA incentive payments would also not 
be available for hospital-based EPs. We 
note that the hospital where a hospital- 
based EP provides his or her Medicare 
covered services would be potentially 
entitled to an incentive payment either 
through the Medicare FFS incentive 
program, or through the MA-affiliated 
hospital EHR incentive program. 
Therefore, we proposed that for such a 
hospital-based MA EP, a qualifying MA 
organization would be no more entitled 
to an MA EP incentive payment under 
the MA EHR incentive program than a 
similarly situated EP would be entitled 
to an incentive payment under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program. 
Comment: We received one comment 
related to hospital-based MA EPs, and 
specifically to our proposal in the 
proposed rule that ‘‘similar to the 
Medicare FFS incentive program, MA 
incentive payments would also not be 
available for hospital-based EPs.’’ The 
commenter noted, however, that unlike 
the proposed regulatory definition of 
‘‘Qualifying Eligible Professional (EP)’’ 
under the Medicare FFS incentive 
program, the proposed regulatory 
definition of ‘‘Qualifying MA EP’’ under 
the MA EHR incentive program did not 
expressly exclude hospital-based EPs. 
The commenter went on to say that if 
hospital-based MA EPs are excluded 
from the MA EHR incentive program 
(for example, because they provide 90% 
or more of their covered services in the 
CY preceding the payment year in an 
outpatient hospital setting), unless there 
is an exception for MA EPs who are 
hospital-based in qualifying MA- 
Affiliated Eligible Hospitals that would 
not qualify for an incentive payment 
under the MA Affiliated hospital EHR 
incentive program payment criteria, 
Qualifying MA Organizations with MA 
EPs who are hospital-based in such 
qualifying MA-Affiliated Hospitals 
would not qualify for an incentive, with 
regard to those MA EPs, under any 
HITECH Act Medicare incentive 
program. The commenter concluded 
that this outcome would not be 
consistent with the objective of the 
HITECH Act to promote widespread 
adoption of HIT through the payment of 
monetary incentives for meaningful use 
of EHRs. The commenter recommended 
that if hospital-based MA EPs are 
excluded from the MA EHR incentive 
program, then we should include an 
exception for MA EPs who are hospital-

 44471 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
based in Qualifying MA-Affiliated 
Eligible Hospitals that would not qualify 
for an incentive payment (or would only 
qualify for a very minimal incentive 
payment) under the MA-Affiliated 
hospital EHR incentive program 
payment criteria. 
Response: We thank the commenter 
for pointing out our oversight in not 
including the hospital-based physician 
exclusion in the proposed regulation 
text related to the MA EP EHR incentive 
program. We will include in regulation 
text the fact that an MA EP is not a 
‘‘hospital-based EP,’’ as that term is 
defined in § 495.4 of this final rule. As 
to a possible exception for hospital- 
based EPs who are practicing in MA- 
affiliated hospitals that do not qualify 
for incentive payments (or that qualify 
for very minimal incentive payments), 
we cannot provide such an exception. 
MA-affiliated eligible hospitals will 
receive EHR incentive payments based 
on the same statutory formula used to 
make EHR incentive payments to other 
‘‘subsection (d)’’ hospitals—see section 
II.C.3. of this final rule, below. There is 
no statutory authority nor is there a 
valid reason to treat MA EPs, in this 
respect, any differently that other EPs 
that are hospital-based. 
After consideration of the public 
comment received, we are modifying 
the regulation text related to the 
definition of MA EP by the additional of 
an item 5) to the definition of 
‘‘Qualifying MA EP’’ at § 495.200 to add 
a specific hospital-based MA EP 
exclusion. 
As discussed in the proposed rule, an 
MA EP must either be employed by the 
qualifying MA organization, or be 
employed by, or be a partner of, an 
entity that through contract with the 
qualifying MA organization furnishes at 
least 80 percent of the entity’s Medicare 
patient care services to enrollees of the 
qualifying MA organization. With 
respect to the later criteria, we did not 
propose to define the term ‘‘entity,’’ but 
instead recognized that there exist a 
range of entities with which MA 
organizations contract for patient care 
services, including physician groups, 
Independent Practice Associations 
(IPAs), Exclusive Provider 
Organizations (EPOs), Physician 
Hospital Organizations (PHOs), and 
Preferred Provider Organizations 
(PPOs). 
Moreover, we recognized that an EP 
may contract with more than one such 
entity, and that these entities often 
contract with a number of MA 
organizations and other health care 
insurers. An EP also may directly 
contract with more than one MA 
organization. In general, we said, it is 
only when an EP is employed by a 
single qualifying MA organization, or is 
employed by or in partnership with an 
entity that contracts with a single 
qualifying MA organization, that an EP 
can satisfy the criteria to be an MA EP. 
We said that the qualifying MA 
organization must attest to the fact that 
each MA EP is a meaningful user of 
certified EHR technology in accordance 
with § 495.4. If all of these conditions 
are met, such an individual is identified 
as an MA EP. We proposed to define the 
term ‘‘MA eligible professional (EP)’’ at 
§ 495.200 as an EP who satisfies all of 
these conditions. 
Finally, we discussed section 4101(d) 
of the HITECH Act which directed the 
Secretary to study and report on ‘‘nearly 
exclusive’’ physicians that primarily 
treat MA enrollees and that would not 
otherwise qualify for incentive 
payments under current law. We 
explained that this rule does not address 
such individuals, as it is limited to 
codifying in regulation existing 
statutory language as discussed herein. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
c. Qualifying MA-Affiliated Eligible 
Hospital 
We proposed to define ‘‘qualifying 
MA-affiliated eligible hospital’’ in 
§ 495.200. A qualifying MA organization 
may receive an incentive payment only 
for a qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospital described under section 
1853(m)(2) of the Act, as added by 
section 4102(c) of the HITECH Act, that 
is a meaningful user of certified EHR 
technology as defined in § 495.4. 
Section 1853(m)(2) of the Act provides 
that such MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals are ‘‘eligible hospitals’’ as 
defined under section 1886(n)(6) of the 
Act and must be under common 
corporate governance with a qualifying 
MA organization that serves individuals 
enrolled under MA plans offered by 
such organization where more than two- 
thirds of the Medicare hospitals 
discharges (or bed-days) are Medicare 
individuals enrolled under MA plans 
offered by such organization. As 
discussed in section II.A.1. of this final 
rule, section 1886(n)(6) of the Act 
defines an ‘‘eligible hospital’’ as a 
subsection (d) hospital (as defined 
under section 1886(d)(1)(B) of the Act). 
In § 495.200, we also proposed to define 
‘‘under common corporate governance’’, 
as a qualifying MA organization and a 
qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospital that have a common parent 
corporation, where one is a subsidiary 
of the other, or where the organization 
and the hospital have a common board 
of directors. 
Section 1853(m)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(c) of the HITECH 
Act, provides that if for a payment year 
at least one-third (33 percent) of an MA 
eligible hospital’s discharges (or bed- 
days) of Medicare patients are covered 
under Part A (rather than under Part C), 
the hospital may only receive an 
incentive payment under section 
1886(n) of the Act—the Medicare FFS 
incentive program. 
In § 495.200 we proposed to define 
‘‘inpatient-bed-days’’ in the same 
manner as that term is defined for 
purposes of implementing section 
4201(a) of the HITECH Act in the 
preamble of this final rule. The term 
will be used in the same way in 
computing incentive payments due 
qualifying MA organizations under the 
qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospital incentive payment program. 
We note that, as discussed in section 
II.B.2.b. of this final rule, under section 
1886(n)(2)(D)(i)(II) of the Act, the 
portion of the Medicare FFS hospital 
incentive payment comprising the 
discharge related amount, or Medicare 
share, is based in part on the estimated 
number of inpatient-bed-days 
attributable to individuals enrolled in 
MA plans under Part C. This means that 
hospitals that treat individuals enrolled 
in MA plans will receive a Medicare 
FFS hospital incentive payment 
partially based on the number of MA- 
enrollee bed-days. To the extent a 
hospital does not meet the 33 percent 
threshold requiring payment through 
the FFS Medicare EHR hospital 
incentive program, incentive payments 
can be made to a qualifying MA 
organization under common corporate 
governance to the extent other 
requirements of the MA EHR hospital 
incentive program are met. (See section 
II.C.3 of this final rule for the 
computation of incentive payments to 
qualifying MA organizations.) 
Therefore, we proposed to make EHR 
incentive payments to qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals under the 
FFS EHR incentive program. Finally, we 
said that to the extent such data 
necessary to estimate the inpatient-bed- 
days-related incentive payment amount 
are not already available to us through 
the normal submission of hospital cost 
reports; we proposed to require that 
qualifying MA organizations seeking 
reimbursement for qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals submit 
similar data. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed.

2. Identification of Qualifying MA 
Organizations, MA EPs, and MA- 
Affiliated Eligible Hospitals 
In § 495.202 we proposed to require 
an MA organization that intended to ask 
for reimbursement under the MA EHR 
incentive payment program to so 
indicate as part of submissions of their 
initial bid under section 1854(a)(1)(A) of 
the Act, and to attest, in some cases, that 
they meet the requirements of a 
qualifying MA organization. For MA 
organizations offering an MA HMO plan 
type, we proposed to deem such 
organizations to meet the definition of 
HMO in 42 U.S.C. 300–gg(b)(3), (that is, 
section 2791(b)(3) of the PHS Act). As 
noted previously, for MA organizations 
offering plan types other than HMOs, 
we proposed to require an attestation by 
the organization that the MA 
organization is recognized under State 
law as an HMO, or that it is a similar 
organization regulated under State law 
for solvency in the same manner and to 
the same extent as an HMO before we 
would make a determination that the 
MA organization is a qualifying MA 
organization for purposes of incentive 
payments. We proposed to require this 
beginning with bids due in June 2010 
(for plan year 2011) for MA 
organizations seeking reimbursement for 
MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals. 
We also proposed requiring qualifying 
MA organizations, as part of their initial 
bids starting with plan year 2011, to 
make a preliminary identification of 
potentially qualifying MA EPs and 
potentially qualifying MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals for which the 
organizations would seek EHR incentive 
payments. 
In developing the preliminary and 
final lists of potentially qualifying MA 
EPs, qualifying MA organizations, we 
said that qualifying MA organizations 
must exclude hospital-based MA EPs. 
We proposed that qualifying MA 
organizations identify hospital-based 
MA EPs using the same criteria outlined 
in section II.A.6 of this final rule for 
identifying hospital-based EPs in the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program. 
Along with both the preliminary and 
final lists of potentially qualifying MA 
EPs and MA-affiliated hospitals, we said 
that qualifying MA organizations would 
be required to submit an attestation that 
these professionals and hospitals meet 
the criteria to be considered eligible. For 
example, for hospitals, the qualifying 
MA organization would need to attest 
that they are under common corporate 
governance with the qualifying MA 
organization and for EPs, the qualifying 
MA organization would need to attest 
that the list does not include any 
hospital-based EPs. 
We proposed requiring qualifying MA 
organizations to provide final 
identification of potentially qualifying 
MA EPs by the end of the MA EP 
payment year (December 31), and final 
identification of potentially qualifying 
MA-affiliated eligible hospitals by the 
end of the MA-affiliated hospital 
payment year (the FFY ending on 
September 30), for which MA EHR 
incentive payments were sought. We 
also proposed requiring qualifying MA 
organizations to report the name, 
practice address, and other identifying 
information, like NPI, for all physicians 
that meet the requirements of a 
qualifying MA EP for which the 
qualifying MA organization would be 
requesting payment under the MA EHR 
incentive payment program. 
We said that once a qualifying MA 
organization identifies potential EPs, we 
are required to ensure that such EPs did 
not receive the maximum EHR incentive 
payment for the relevant payment year 
under the Medicare FFS program under 
section 1848(o)(1)(A) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(a) of the HITECH 
Act, before releasing an incentive 
payment to a qualifying MA 
organization related to such EP. (See 
section 1853(l)(3)(B)(i) of the Act, as 
added by section 4101(c) of the HITECH 
Act). Therefore, in order to allow us 
time to determine whether an MA EP 
received the maximum EHR incentive 
payment under the Medicare FFS 
program, we proposed not to make 
incentive payments to qualifying MA 
organizations for the MA EPs for a 
payment year until after the final 
computation of EP incentive payments 
for that year under the Medicare FFS 
program. Additionally, we proposed to 
require qualifying MA organizations to 
ensure that all MA EPs are enumerated 
through the NPI system, in order to 
detect and prevent duplicate payment 
for EPs under both the FFS and MA 
EHR incentive payment programs. 
Comment: Two commenters 
contended that requiring MA 
organizations to provide even a 
preliminary list of MA EPs by June 2010 
(for payment year 2011) would be 
unrealistic and burdensome, especially 
when publication of a Final Rule seems 
unlikely before May 2010 at the earliest. 
For 2011, any preliminary list will be 
inaccurate, despite good faith efforts 
and reasonable due diligence. Moreover, 
CMS has not stated any justifiable 
purpose for requiring such a 
preliminary list. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that it would be 
unnecessarily burdensome and 
unrealistic to require MA organizations 
to provide preliminary lists as early as 
June of 2010 of potential MA EPs for 
incentive payment year 2011. We will 
change the timing of this requirement in 
§ 495.202(b)(1) to say that as part of 
initial bids for plan year 2012 MA 
organizations will be required to submit 
preliminary lists in June of 2011 (when 
bids are due for 2012) of potential MA 
EPs for incentive payment year 2011. 
Thus, we will delay the requirement for 
a full year. The purpose of such 
preliminary lists is to identify potential 
MA EPs that have, for instance, 
registered as FFS Medicare or Medicaid 
EPs on the National Level Repository. 
The intent of getting these lists before 
payment is due, or before a final 
determination of eligibility can be made, 
is to help qualifying MA organizations 
know of any potential conflicts in time 
to ‘‘cure’’ them before final payment 
determinations are made. 
Comment: One commenter objected to 
CMS’ proposal that MA organizations be 
required to submit final lists of MA EPs 
and MA hospitals by the last day of the 
payment year, including the attestations 
of meaningful use and accurate payment 
calculation. The commenter argued that 
this timing would not allow sufficient 
time to ensure that data are complete 
and accurate, especially considering 
that MA organizations bear the 
additional burden of having to develop 
and support internal administrative 
systems to determine eligibility and to 
calculate payment (we will calculate 
FFS EP payments based on claims 
submitted). The commenter 
recommended that we extend the 
deadlines to produce both preliminary 
and final lists of MA EPs and hospitals. 
The commenter suggested that MA 
organizations be given until 90 to 120 
days after the close of the payment year 
to identify and list eligible EPs and 
hospitals (for example, after 31 
December 2011 for plan year 2011). 
Response: We agree with the 
commenter that additional time should 
be permitted and we are therefore 
adding a due date in § 495.202(b)(3) for 
final identification of potentially 
qualifying MA EPs and MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals of 60 days after the 
close of the payment year. We believe 
60 days is reasonable, since it is the 
same as the time in which FFS EPs have 
to submit claims for consideration 
under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
payment program. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are modifying 
the regulation text related to the timing 
of both preliminary and final 
identification of MA EPs and MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals. Preliminary

identification of MA EPs and MA-

2011 will need to occur by the bidding 
deadline in June 2011, and final 
identification will need to occur within 
60 days of the close of the payment year. 
Accordingly, we are respectively 
modifying the regulation text at 
§ 495.202(b)(1) and § 495.202(b)(3). We 
are also modifying the regulation text at 
§ 495.204(b)(2) to be consistent with the 
change to § 495.202(b)(3), since final 
identification in § 495.202(b)(3) should 
occur at the same time as final revenue

calculations of payments due under the

be finalized. We are also modifying the

be consistent with the changes to 
§ 495.204(b)(2) and § 495.202(b)(3),

We also proposed to require all 
qualifying MA organizations to self- 
report and identify themselves, 
regardless of whether they have 
qualifying MA EPs or MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals for whom or which the 
organization plans to claim incentive 
payments at the time the initial bid is 
due (the first Monday of June, see 
section 1854(a)(1)(A) of the Act) 
beginning in 2014 for bids related to 
plan year 2015. We proposed to require 
this reporting by all qualifying MA 
organizations in years beginning with 
2014 in anticipation of the statutory 
requirement in sections 1853(l)(4) and 
1853(m)(4) of the Act, to negatively 
adjust our capitation payments to 
qualifying MA organizations for MA EPs 
and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that 
are not meaningful users of certified 
EHR technology for years beginning 
with 2015. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
3. Computation of Incentives to 
Qualifying MA Organizations for MA 
EPs and Hospitals 
In § 495.204, we proposed a 
methodology under which payments to 
qualifying MA organizations for 
qualifying MA EPs will be computed. 
Section 1853(l)(3)(A) of the Act provides 
that in applying section 1848(o), instead 
of the additional payment amount 
specified under section 1848(o)(1)(A) of 
the Act, the Secretary may substitute an 
amount determined by the Secretary, to 
the extent feasible and practical, to be 
similar to the estimated amount in the 
aggregate that would be payable under, 
or would be based on, the Medicare 
physician fee schedule under Part B 
instead of Part C. Section II.B.1. of this 
final rule discusses these provisions. 
Section 1853(m)(3)(A) of the Act 
provides that, in providing an incentive 
payment to qualifying MA organizations 
for MA-affiliated hospitals, we 
substitute for the amount specified 
under section 1886(n)(2) of the Act—the 
incentive payment amount under 
Medicare FFS for qualifying eligible 
hospitals—an amount determined by 
the Secretary to be similar to the 
estimated amount in the aggregate that 
would be payable if payment for 
services furnished by such hospitals 
was payable under Part A instead of Part 
C. (For more detailed information see 
section II.B.2. of this final rule.) 
Sections 1848(o)(1)(D)(i) and 
1886(n)(2)(F) of the Act permit us to 
make incentive payments for a year in 
installments, although we proposed to 
make a single lump sum payment with 
respect to MA EPs. With respect to MA 
EP incentive payments, we said we read 
the term ‘‘aggregate’’ to mean the 
aggregate installment payments made by 
us under the FFS EHR incentive 
program to a qualifying EP over the 
course of the relevant payment year. 
The duplicate payment provisions in 
section 1853(l)(3)(B)(i)(II) of the Act 
direct us to make payment for EPs ‘‘only 
under’’ the MA EHR incentive program 
‘‘and not under’’ the Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive program to the extent any EP 
earned ‘‘less than [the] maximum 
incentive payment for the same period’’ 
under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program. We noted in the proposed rule 
that section 1853(l)(1) of the Act 
provides that section 1848(o) of the Act 
applies in a ‘‘similar,’’ but not the same, 
manner to qualifying MA organizations 
as it applies to EPs under Part B. The 
Medicare FFS incentive payment 
program under section 1848(o) does not 
include payment for professional 
services provided to MA enrollees, but 
rather only for services paid under Part 
B. In a similar manner we proposed to 
limit payment to an MA organization to 
only payment for their EPs’ services to 
MA enrollees of plans offered by the 
MA organization. We said we did not 
believe it would be appropriate to 
provide an incentive payment to an MA 
organization for services provided to 
individuals covered under Part B. 
Therefore, we proposed, that in 
calculating qualifying MA EP incentive 
payments, we would only consider 
covered professional services provided 
to enrollees of MA plans offered by 
qualifying MA organizations and would 
not include in the calculation any 
services reimbursed by Medicare FFS. 
Comment: Many commenters asked if 
MA plan beneficiaries and services 
would be counted in the calculation of 
FFS EHR incentives and, if so, if it 
would require separate submissions to 
each MA plan in the local market. 
Response: As we explained in the 
preamble of the proposed rule, we 
cannot make MA EP incentive payments 
for Part B services covered and paid for 
on a fee-for-service basis under the 
original Medicare program. We also 
cannot make MA EP incentive payments 
to entities other than qualifying MAOs. 
In short, the Medicare Advantage 
services provided by EPs that are not 
qualifying MA EPs—defined in statute 
and in this rule at § 495.200—are not 
reimbursable under the EHR incentive 
payment program. 
Comment: Two commenters 
contended that the proposed Medicare 
Advantage incentive computation was 
inconsistent. They said that sections 
II.C.3. through 5. of this final rule 
discuss compensation, but the preamble 
says that the Secretary may substitute a 
different amount. This discrepancy 
should be clarified. 
Response: We disagree. The statute 
says that we can substitute an amount 
‘‘that is similar to the estimated amount 
that would be payable or based on the 
fee schedule.’’ It does not say that we 
can substitute a different amount. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are 
implementing these provisions as 
proposed. 
We also said that under the Medicare 
FFS EHR incentive program, an EP’s 
incentive payment could not exceed the 
annual limits specified under section 
1848(o)(1)(B)(i) of the Act. We proposed 
that similar payment limits apply to 
qualifying MA organizations for their 
qualifying MA EPs. Specifically, section 
1848(o)(1)(B) of the Act provides that 
the incentive payment for an EP for a 
given year shall not exceed the 
following amounts: 
• For the EP’s first payment year, 
$15,000 (or, if the first payment year is 
2011 or 2012, $18,000). 
• For the EP’s second payment year, 
$12,000. 
• For the EP’s third payment year, 
$8,000. 
• For the EP’s fourth payment year, 
$4,000.

• For the EP’s fifth payment year, 
$2,000. 
• For any succeeding year, $0. 
Note that, similar to the Medicare FFS 
EHR incentive program, there will be no 
incentive payments made with respect 
to a year after 2016. We proposed 
similar restrictions related to qualifying 
MA organizations. So, the maximum 
cumulative incentive payment over 5 
years to a qualifying MA organization 
for each of its qualifying MA EPs that 
meaningfully use certified EHRs 
beginning on or before 2012 would be 
$44,000 per qualifying MA EP. For 
qualifying MA organizations first 
reporting the meaningful use of certified 
EHRs by qualifying MA EPs after 2014, 
there is no incentive payment amount 
available. Subject to an exception 
discussed below, for MA organizations 
first reporting the meaningful use of 
certified EHRs by qualifying MA EPs in 
2013 or 2014, the maximum potential 
incentive payment per qualifying EP is, 
respectively, $39,000 over 4 years, and 
$24,000 over 3 years. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
We proposed to make MA EP 
incentive payments to qualifying MA 
organizations on the same payment 
cycle for all employed/partnering 
qualifying EPs of the organization. In 
other words, all MA EPs of a specific 
qualifying MA organization will be in 
the same payment year with respect to 
the amount of the incentive payment 
per qualifying EP that we will make. So, 
for instance, if a qualifying MA 
organization is in its second payment 
year in 2013 and it hires a new EP for 
which the qualifying MA organization 
had not previously received an EHR 
incentive payment, we will nevertheless 
make a second year incentive payment 
(up to $12,000 in 2013) with respect to 
such an MA EP—assuming all other 
conditions are met. Thus, the limits on 
MA EP incentive payments discussed 
above are applied to the qualifying MA 
organization’s entire MA EP population 
in any specific payment year relative to 
that MA organization, regardless of the 
length of employment/partnership of/ 
between that specific MA EP and that 
specific qualifying MA organization. 
Under section 1848(o)(1)(B)(iv) of the 
Act, the annual incentive payment limit 
for EPs who predominantly furnish Part 
B services in a geographic health 
professional shortage area (HPSA) is 
increased by 10 percent. While we do 
not anticipate that MA EPs would 
generally practice in a HPSA area, to the 
extent that an MA EP practices in an 
area where he or she would be entitled 
to the 10 percent increase, that amount 
would apply to MA EPs as well. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
We explored various ways of 
computing the EP-level incentive 
payments due qualifying MA 
organizations whose qualifying MA EPs 
meaningfully use certified EHR 
technology. One option that we 
considered was using MA plan bidding 
and payment data to estimate average 
annual MA revenue for qualifying MA 
EPs with respect to a qualifying MA 
organization. However, we did not 
pursue this option because the approach 
results in an average revenue amount 
across all potentially qualifying MA EPs 
with respect to a qualifying MA 
organization and, therefore, would 
include revenue amounts that exceed 
the annual per-professional ceiling on 
incentive payments under FFS for all 
EPs. We said we believed such a result 
is contrary to the legal requirement that 
qualifying MA organizations are to 
receive incentive payments only for 
qualifying MA EPs that actually provide 
at least 20 hours per week of patient 
care services. Under this method there 
would be also no way to know if the EP 
provided 80 percent of his/her 
professional Medicare services to 
enrollees of the organization. 
We also considered a reporting system 
for which qualifying MA organizations 
would be required to report eligible- 
professional-specific information along 
with MA patient encounters for 
nonhospital-based office visits. 
Specifically, we examined requiring 
qualifying MA organizations reporting 
qualifying MA EP encounters with MA 
plan enrollees based on the five levels 
of office visit codes recognized by 
Medicare FFS. 
We said we believed that such a 
process would be administratively 
burdensome and difficult to 
operationalize. Therefore, we proposed 
an alternative approach, but sought 
input from interested parties as to 
which of the approaches, or perhaps 
others, would best address the statutory 
requirement to compensate qualifying 
MA organizations for qualifying MA EPs 
the amount that would be payable if 
payment for services furnished by such 
professionals were made under Part B 
instead of Part C. 
Therefore, in § 495.204(b)(1) through 
(3) we proposed an approach in which 
the revenue received by the qualifying 
MA EP for services provided to 
enrollees of the qualifying MA 
organization would serve as a proxy for 
the amount that would have been paid 
if the services were payable under Part 
B. Under our proposed approach, the 
qualifying MA organization would 
report to us the aggregate annual 
amount of revenue received by each 
qualifying MA EP for MA plan enrollees 
of the MA organization. We said we 
would calculate the incentive payment 
amount due the qualifying MA 
organization for each qualifying MA EP 
as an amount equal to 75 percent of the 
reported annual MA revenue of the 
qualifying MA EP, up to the maximum 
amounts specified under section 
1848(o)(1)(B) of the Act. 
For qualifying MA EPs who were 
compensated on a salaried basis, we 
proposed in § 495.204(b)(4) requiring 
the qualifying MA organization to 
develop a methodology for estimating 
the portion of the qualifying MA EP’s 
salary attributable to providing services 
that would otherwise be covered as 
professional services under Part B of 
Medicare to MA plan enrollees of the 
MA organization. The methodology, 
which would require review and 
approval by us, could be based on the 
relative share of patient care hours spent 
with MA enrollees of the organization or 
another reasonable method. So, for 
instance, if a qualifying MA EP spends 
30 percent of his or her time providing 
covered Part B physician office services 
to MA plan enrollees, then the 
qualifying MA organization would 
report 30 percent of the qualifying MA 
EP’s salary as annual revenue, which 
would be used to compute the amount 
of the MA incentive payment due to the 
qualifying MA organization for the 
qualifying MA EP. Thus, if the 
qualifying MA EP had a base salary of 
$150,000, 30 percent would be 
$45,000—which is well over the 
threshold of $24,000 needed by the MA 
organization to qualify for a maximum 
incentive payment of up to $18,000 (70 
percent of $24,000) for such a qualifying 
MA EP in any year. We also proposed 
to require that salaries be prorated to 
ensure that the amount reported reflects 
the salary paid for the applicable year, 
where necessary. 
We also said that salaried physicians’ 
compensation typically does not 
include an allowance for administrative 
practice costs. Given that Part B allowed 
amounts do include practice expense 
costs, we proposed allowing qualifying 
MA organizations to identify, where 
appropriate, an additional amount 
related to overhead that would be added 
to the qualifying MA EP’s estimated Part 
B compensation. To the extent Medicare 
FFS compensation to physicians 
includes an amount for office space 
rental, office staffing, and equipment, 
we believe that qualifying MA 
organizations should also be permitted

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
to include an amount for overhead 
related to such costs not directly 
experienced by salaried qualifying MA 
EPs. In § 495.204(b)(4)(ii), we proposed 
requiring qualifying MA organizations 
to develop a methodology for estimating 
the additional amount related to 
overhead attributable to providing 
services that would otherwise be 
covered under Part B of Medicare. We 
said the methodology would require 
review and approval by us. 
For qualifying MA EPs who are not 
salaried (that is, who are paid on a 
capitated or fee-for-service basis), we 
proposed in § 495.204(b)(5) to require 
qualifying MA organizations to obtain 
attestations from such EPs and to submit 
to us information from the attestations 
as to the amount of compensation 
received by the EPs for MA plan 
enrollees of the MA organization. We 
are proposing such attestations because 
many EPs are not paid directly by MA 
organizations, but rather by 
intermediary contracting entities, such 
as physician groups, and as a result the 
qualifying MA organization may not 
otherwise know how much 
compensation is received by each 
qualifying MA EP. In reporting 
compensation, we are proposing that the 
EPs include only those amounts for 
professional services that would 
otherwise be payable under Part B and 
for which payment would be made 
under, or would be based on, the 
Medicare physician fee schedule. 
Comment: One commenter 
recommended that final CMS 
regulations retain the exact 
requirements outlined in 
§§ 495.204(b)(4) and (5). Two 
commenters said that CMS should allow 
flexibility in methods MA organizations 
propose for computing incentive 
payments so long as the organization’s 
approach is reasonable, straightforward, 
and fairly equates to the Medicare fee- 
for-service approach without imposing 
undue burdens on MA organization 
systems or compromising EP privacy. 
The proposed rule describes how 
incentive payment amounts will be 
calculated for eligible hospitals and EPs. 
The proposed rule presents options for 
a MA payment methodology, but 
expressly solicits comments from MA 
organizations about how such a 
methodology could be designed to fairly 
approximate the FFS payment 
calculation. The commenters included 
recommendations about how MA 
organizations could be reimbursed and 
what methodology would be a 
reasonable proxy for the Part B-based 
payment applied to FFS physicians, 
based on the amount of individual 
physician care provided to MA 
members. The commenters said that MA 
EPs who are employed by their 
organizations are independent 
physician group practices that contract 
exclusively with their organizations to 
meet the health needs of their members, 
including MA enrollees. Their 
organizations do not pay the salaries of 
MA EPs who provide patient care 
services to their members and patients. 
They said that CMS has proposed that 
the organization that directly pays the 
EP salaries would perform a calculation 
and attest to the MA organization about 
the amount of payment. They said that 
while this would mitigate some of the 
confidentiality concerns related to 
sharing salary information with the 
health plans, salary information would 
still be potentially exposed to CMS. 
They said that another disadvantage of 
using actual salary as a basis for 
calculating the incentive payment is 
that this approach potentially 
introduces unacceptable variability into 
the estimation of proxy amounts for 
Medicare services. For example, two 
MA EPs, whose salaries vary 
significantly but provide the same 
Medicare services in a reporting period, 
would have different proxy amounts. 
Further, they said, if such EPs were 
billing under Part B, the amount of 
Medicare services each billed would be 
the same, regardless of whether their 
incomes were the same. These 
commenters went on to propose an 
alternative method of computing a 
proxy Part B amount. They said that as 
a first step, the MA organization would 
calculate the percentage of clinic time 
each physician spends caring for MA 
members. This MA Practice percentage 
could be derived by either: (1) Capturing 
the total scheduled appointment time 
for MA members for each MA EP and 
dividing that amount by the total 
scheduled time for that MA EP (for all 
appointments); or (2) capturing the 
number of MA member visits/ 
procedures for each MA EP and 
dividing that amount by the total 
number of visits/procedures for that MA 
EP (for all members). The organization 
would then calculate the average 
practice cost by specialty for all 
specialties identified in the annual 
American Medical Group Association’s 
(‘‘AMGA’’) salary survey. The 
commenters explained that AMGA 
survey provides the median 
compensation per physician in most 
specialties as well as the non- 
compensation related clinic costs per 
physician (staffing, supplies, overhead, 
etc.) in most specialties. Adding 
specialty specific compensation data 
(for groups > 100 physicians) to the 
combined average non-compensation 
related clinic costs for that specialty (for 
all sized groups) would provide a 
surrogate amount for each specialty’s 
total operating costs. This would 
produce the Average Operating Costs by 
Specialty. Multiplying each MA EP’s 
MA Practice percentage and the Average 
Operating Costs by Specialty for that 
MA EP’s practice specialty would 
produce a surrogate Medicare Part B 
amount. For each MA EP, the MA 
organization would be paid an incentive 
equal to 75 percent of the surrogate 
Medicare billing amount for that 
physician, such incentive not to exceed 
the maximum incentive for each 
payment year of the program (for 
example, $18,000 if the first year of 
participation is 2011). 
Response: While we appreciate the 
thought and effort that went into this 
proposed alternative method of 
calculating MA EP incentive payments, 
we are reluctant to adopt it for the 
simple reason that where salaries, 
practice costs, or actual MA EP 
compensation can be known, we believe 
it is a better read of statutory 
requirements to work from that actual 
compensation and cost data than it 
would be to allow estimation of both. In 
many respects the proposed alternative 
method is similar to the method 
discussed and disposed of in the 
proposed rule related to estimating 
physician compensation based on MA 
bidding and payment data. Although the 
commenters’ alternative version factors 
in actual practice time, we believe using 
AMGA salary survey data would be 
inferior to using actual physician 
compensation practice cost information. 
To the extent actual salary information 
is unknown or unavailable to the MA 
organization, we believe it could be 
provided to us in a manner that would 
protect the privacy of individual MA 
EPs and physician groups. Furthermore, 
the proposal also estimates ‘‘non- 
compensation related clinic costs’’ based 
on AMGA data, which is, again, 
inappropriate, when actual overhead 
costs might be quite different in a 
specific MA organization. However, 
based on the commenters concerns 
regarding provider privacy and the need 
to develop a consistent and verifiable 
method of computing the amount 
payable to qualifying MA organizations 
for MA EPs we are modifying the 
regulation text at § 495.204(b)(5) to say 
that qualifying MA organizations ‘‘may’’ 
obtain attestations from qualifying MA 
EPs and ‘‘may’’ submit such information 
to us—rather than ‘‘must.’’ And, we add 
a new subparagraph (6) that allows the 
physician group or other payer to

assurances that we will use the EP

purpose than to compute the MA EP 
incentive payment due the qualifying 
MA organization. 
Comment: One commenter said that 
in the proposed rule the methodology 
for estimating the portion of the 
qualifying MA EP’s salary attributable to 
providing services that would otherwise 
be covered as professional services 
under Part B of Medicare to MA plan 
enrollees of the MA organization would 
require review and approval by CMS; 
and that such methodology ‘‘could be 
based on the relative share of patient 
care hours spent with MA enrollees of 
the organization or another reasonable 
method.’’ However, the commenter 
opined, the proposed rule offers no 
details about how the review and 
approval process would be conducted, 
including dates and timelines for the 
process. Thus, the commenter 
recommended that CMS permit 
flexibility in allowing MA organizations 
to develop methodologies that will be 
reasonable in light of organization 
structure and systems, it is important to 
provide some guidance about how CMS 
will review and approve such proposals. 
CMS should permit, the commenter 
said, any reasonable payment 
methodology method that is fair, 
relatively easy to administer, subject to 
audit and that provides a reliable 
approximation of Medicare Part B 
billing. In addition, the commenter 
concluded, CMS should provide a 
simple process for submission and 
approval of MA payment 
methodologies. 
Response: In the proposed rule at 
§ 495.204(b)(4) we offered flexibility 
related to the ‘‘methodology for 
estimating the portion of each qualifying 
MA EP’s salary attributable to providing 
services that would otherwise be 
covered as professional services under 
Part B,’’ said that the methodology had 
to be ‘‘approved by CMS,’’ and that the 
amount could include an ‘‘additional 
amount related to overhead.’’ Based on 
this comment we are adding a new 
clause (iii) that says that such 
methodological proposals must be 
submitted to CMS by June of the 
payment year, must be auditable by an 
independent third-party, and that CMS 
will review and approve or disapprove 
such proposals in a timely manner. 
Comment: One commenter wanted to 
know what percentage of the incentive 
payments will go to eligible 
professionals under Medicare 
Advantage. 
Response: No known percentage of 
incentive payment will go to eligible 
professionals under Medicare 
Advantage, since MA EP payments are 
made solely to qualifying MA 
organizations. 
In the proposed rule we said that in 
applying the instruction in section 
1853(m)(3)(A) of the Act to substitute 
for the amount specified under section 
1886(n)(2) of the Act an amount similar 
to the estimated amount in the aggregate 
that would be payable if payment for the 
hospitals’ services were made under 
Part A instead of Part C, we read the 
term ‘‘aggregate’’ to mean the aggregate 
installment payments made by us if 
EHR incentive payments were made 
under Part A instead of Part C. 
Incentive payments to eligible 
hospitals under the Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive program are comprised of 
three components: (1) An initial amount 
composed of a base incentive payment 
of $2,000,000 and a second incentive 
payment amount of $200 per discharge 
for discharges 1,150—23,000 during a 
12-month period selected by the 
Secretary; (2) the Medicare share; and 
(3) a transition factor. As discussed in 
the preamble related to § 495.104(c), for 
purposes of calculating incentive 
payments to eligible hospitals under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program, 
we are proposing that the 12-month 
period be based on the FFY. For the 
purpose of calculating incentive 
payments for qualifying MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals, we similarly are 
proposing that the 12-month period be 
based on the FFY. 
Section II.B. of this final rule 
discusses our methodology for 
calculating the incentive payment for 
qualifying eligible hospitals under the 
Medicare FFS EHR program. As set forth 
in § 495.204(c)(2), we proposed to use 
the FFS EHR hospital incentive program 
for purposes of calculating and making 
the incentive payment for qualifying 
MA-affiliated hospitals. To the extent 
data are not available to reimburse MA- 
affiliated hospitals through the FFS 
hospital incentive program, we 
proposed to require submission of such 
data to us and adopt the same definition 
of ‘‘inpatient-bed-days’’ and other terms 
under the Medicare FFS EHR hospital 
incentive program specified in § 495.104 
of this final rule. In such a case we 
proposed in § 495.204(c)(1) to make 
payment for such MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals to the qualifying MA 
organization. 
The formula for calculating the 
hospital incentive payment under the 
Medicare FFS hospital incentive 
program is an initial amount of the sum 
of the base amount of $2,000,000 per 
hospital plus an additional $200 per 
discharge for discharges 1,150 through 
23,000 for that hospital in that payment 
year. This initial amount is then 
multiplied by a transition factor and 
then again by the Medicare share. These 
last two numbers are fractions and will 
tend to reduce the initial amount 
computed in the first step. 
Similar to the Medicare FFS EHR 
hospital incentive program, we 
proposed to use inpatient-bed-day data, 
discharges, and other components of the 
FFS calculation for each qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospital from the 
hospital-specific fiscal year that ends 
during the FFY prior to the FFY that 
serves as the payment year. To the 
extent such data are not already 
available to us through the normal 
submission of hospital cost reporting 
data; we proposed requiring qualifying 
MA organizations seeking 
reimbursement for their qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals to submit 
similar data. 
We said we can only pay for 
qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals under common corporate 
governance based on inpatient-bed-days 
computed on a fiscal year basis where 
less than one third of the inpatient-bed- 
days of Medicare patients are covered 
under Medicare FFS—Part A. However, 
it does not appear that reimbursement 
only under the MA EHR incentive 
program is required for qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals that are 
under common corporate governance. 
Rather, section 1853(m)(3)(B), of the Act 
only prohibits payment under the MA 
EHR incentive program when Medicare 
hospital inpatient-bed-days covered 
under Part A exceed 33 percent of all 
Medicare inpatient-bed-days. Although 
eligibility under the MA EHR hospital 
incentive program is not available to 
qualifying MA organizations for any 
specific hospital when FFS inpatient- 
bed-days exceed 33 percent of the 
Medicare total, a qualifying MA 
organization could be reimbursed 
through the Medicare FFS EHR hospital 
incentive payment program for 
qualifying hospitals under common 
corporate governance even for hospitals 
with very low ratios of FFS to MA 
inpatient-bed days. 
Given that the hospital incentive 
payment methodology and payment 
amount will be identical under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program 
and the MA EHR incentive program, 
and given that there is no statutory 
prohibition on reimbursing a qualifying 
MA-affiliated eligible hospital through 
the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program, for purposes of administrative 
efficiency, and pursuant to our authority

 44477 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
under section 1857(e) of the Act to add 
new ‘‘appropriate’’ contract terms 
(incorporated for Part D by section 
1860D–12(b)(3)(D) of the Act), we 
proposed requiring that qualifying MA 
organizations receive incentive 
payments for qualifying MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals through their affiliated 
hospitals under the Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive program if they are eligible for 
such payments, rather than through the 
MA EHR incentive program. We believe 
this is the most efficient way in which 
to administer the MA EHR hospital 
incentive program in light of the 
expected low volume of MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals (approximately 50 
hospitals), and in light of preliminary 
data which indicates that MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals already submit 
Medicare cost reporting data to us from 
which we can compute hospital 
incentive payments due. To the extent 
sufficient data do not exist to make such 
payments under the Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive program, qualifying MA 
organizations will be required to submit 
additional data to us. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
To the extent payments are made to 
qualifying MA organizations for 
qualifying MA EPs or qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals, we proposed 
to conduct selected compliance reviews 
to ensure that EPs and eligible hospitals 
for which such organizations received 
incentive payments were actually 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology, in accordance with our 
existing authority in section 1857(d) of 
the Act and 42 CFR 422.504 of the 
regulations related to protections against 
fraud. The reviews would include 
validation of meaningful user 
attestations, the status of the 
organization as a qualifying MA 
organization, and verification of both 
meaningful use and data used to 
calculate incentive payments. We 
proposed requiring MA organizations to 
maintain evidence of compliance with 
all aspects of the MA EHR incentive 
payment program for 10 years after the 
date payment is made with respect to a 
given payment year. Payments that 
result from incorrect or fraudulent 
attestations, cost data, or any other 
submission required to establish 
eligibility or to qualify for a payment, 
will be recouped by CMS from the MA 
organization. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
Finally, as we indicated above in 
section II.C.2. of this final rule, we are 
modifying the regulation text at 
§ 495.204(b)(2) to be consistent with the 
change to § 495.202(b)(3), since final 
identification in § 495.202(b)(3) should 
occur at the same time as final revenue 
reporting under § 495.204(b)(2), in order 
to ensure that calculations of payments 
due under the MA EP incentive 
payment program can be finalized. 
4. Timeframe for Payment 
For payments to qualifying MA EPs, 
in § 495.206 we proposed the timeframe 
for payment to be after the Medicare 
FFS program computes incentive 
payments due under the Medicare FFS 
EHR incentive program—so the first 
possible incentive payments would be 
made sometime in early 2012. We 
proposed that payments for qualifying 
MA-affiliated eligible hospitals under 
common corporate governance occur in 
the same manner and in the same time 
frame as payments made under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program to 
‘‘subsection (d)’’ hospitals as discussed 
in section II.B.2.d. of this final rule. 
We proposed to define ‘‘payment 
year’’ with respect to qualifying MA EPs 
in § 495.200. Section 1853(l)(3)(C) of the 
Act directs us to establish the same first 
payment year for all EPs with respect to 
any specific qualifying MA 
organization. Consistent with the 
statute, we proposed to pay a qualifying 
MA organization on the same schedule 
for all of its qualifying MA EPs. In other 
words, the first year during which the 
qualifying MA organization receives an 
incentive payment for its qualifying EPs 
will be considered the first payment 
year for all of its qualifying EPs. 
Accordingly, for purposes of 
determining the applicable incentive 
payment limits, the second, third, 
fourth, and fifth years during which the 
qualifying MA organization receives an 
incentive payment for its qualifying EPs 
will be considered the second, third, 
fourth, and fifth payments years for each 
of its qualifying EPs, regardless of 
whether the MA organization claimed 
an incentive payment for a particular EP 
for a prior payment year. Such a 
consistent payment cycle relative to 
qualifying MA organizations and 
qualifying MA EPs obviates the need to 
track payment years and payment 
adjustment years based on prior 
payments or adjustments with respect to 
any individual qualifying MA EP. 
Rather, for purposes of payment years 
and payment adjustment years, any EP 
employed by or partnering with any 
specific MA organization will be on the 
same cycle with respect to that 
organization. 
We said that similar to the Medicare 
FFS EHR incentive program, payment to 
qualifying MA organizations for 
qualifying MA EPs and payment for 
qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals is available only for a finite 
number of years. As previously 
discussed in the section on the 
calculation of MA incentive payments, 
above, a qualifying MA organization can 
receive an incentive payment of up to 
$18,000 for each of its qualifying MA 
EPs for its first payment year if its first 
payment year is 2011 or 2012, or up to 
$15,000, if its first payment year is 2013, 
or up to $12,000, if its first payment 
year is 2014. Note that, similar to the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program, 
there would be no incentive payments 
made with respect to a year after 2016. 
We proposed to define ‘‘payment 
year’’ with respect to qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals in § 495.200. 
For incentive payments for qualifying 
MA-affiliated eligible hospitals, the first 
year for which an MA organization may 
claim payment is FY 2011. Similar to 
the Medicare FFS EHR hospital 
incentive program, we proposed to use 
the hospital inpatient bed-days data 
from the hospital FY that ends during 
the FFY prior to the FY that serves as 
the payment year. For qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals, we proposed 
to compute hospital EHR incentive 
payments due in the same manner as 
they are being computed in the 
Medicare FFS hospital incentive 
payment program. For qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals for which the 
first payment year is 2011 through 2013, 
up to 3 additional years of incentive 
payments are available. For qualifying 
MA-affiliated eligible hospitals for 
which the first payment year is after 
2015, no EHR payment incentive can be 
made for that year or any subsequent 
year. Finally, for qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals for which the 
first payment year is 2014 or 2015, only 
2 (or 1) additional year(s) of hospital 
incentive payments will be available. 
Unlike the fixed schedule for 
application of limitation on incentive 
payments for MA EPs discussed 
previously in this section of the final 
rule in which all employed/partnering 
MA EPs will be paid on the same 
schedule (first payment year, second 
payment year, etc.) with respect to any 
specific qualifying MA organization, we 
proposed to make payments to MA 
organizations for MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals on a hospital specific basis. In 
other words, if a qualifying MA 
organization has some MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals with a first payment 
year of FY 2011, it may have other MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals with a first 
payment year of FYs 2012 through 2015. 
Comment: Two commenters said that 
payments to MA organizations will be

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
delayed every year by an unspecified 
amount of time. The commenters said 
that it was understood that CMS is 
charged by statute to avoid making 
duplicate payments, however MA 
organizations should be paid without 
unspecified delay. A suggested 
alternative by the commenters was to 
permit MA organizations to attest that 
their MA EPs will not seek any payment 
under the Medicare FFS Incentive 
Program. Alternatively, the commenters 
suggested, CMS could use an 
installment payment system (permitted 
under statute as stated) for MA 
organizations. The commenters said that 
this would permit partial payment until 
the resolution of the duplicate payment 
issue and would avoid long delays in 
paying MA incentives. 
Response: We do not agree that MA 
organization EHR incentive payments 
are subject to ‘‘unspecified delay.’’ 
Rather, since MA organizations will be 
paid for MA EPs only if such EPs were 
not paid the maximum incentive 
payment under the FFS EHR incentive 
payment program, and since final 
claims data will not be available until 
two months after the close of the 
payment year—see § 495.102(a)(2)— 
CMS will not be able to compute MA EP 
payments until the FFS EHR incentive 
payment program has completed its 
calculations. This will occur in the early 
spring of the year after the close of a 
payment year. Moreover, MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals will receive EHR 
incentive payments on the same 
schedule as other ‘‘subpart (d)’’ 
hospitals. Finally, note that MA EPs are 
free to leave qualifying MA 
organizations at any time, and since EPs 
are also free to register for eligibility 
under FFS Medicare or Medicaid EHR 
incentive payments, an attestation by a 
qualifying MA organization would have 
little merit. For these reasons we cannot 
accept the suggestion that qualifying 
MA organizations receive interim or 
partial mid-year payments for MA EPs. 
After consideration of the public 
comment received, we are 
implementing these provisions as 
proposed. 
5. Avoiding Duplicate Payment 
We proposed duplicate payment 
avoidance provisions in § 495.208. 
Section 1853(l)(3)(B) of the Act, as 
added by the HITECH Act, is entitled 
‘‘Avoiding Duplication of Payments.’’ 
Subclause (I) of clause (i) of this 
paragraph of the Act states that to the 
extent an MA EP is entitled to the 
maximum incentive payment under 
section 1848(o)(1)(A) of the Act, the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive payment 
program, such incentive payment will 
only be made under the Medicare FFS 
EHR incentive program. Therefore, 
before payments can be made to 
qualifying MA organizations for MA 
EPs, we must first determine if a 
maximum incentive payment under the 
Medicare FFS program has been 
previously earned by potential MA EPs. 
Under the Medicare FFS incentive 
payment program, incentive payment 
calculations will not be completed for 
the first payment year, 2011, until the 
early part of 2012. Therefore, we said 
we would not be able to make payments 
to qualifying MA organizations for MA 
EPs until claims submissions counted 
for Medicare FFS incentive payments 
for CY 2011 have been closed, and 
payment calculations for participating 
EP under the Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive program have been completed. 
This will occur in the early part of CY 
2012. In the MA EHR incentive payment 
program we proposed to follow the FFS 
EHR incentive payment program 
schedule—first computing Medicare 
FFS incentive payments for EPs and 
then computing and paying MA EP 
incentive payments, where 
appropriate—in all subsequent payment 
years. 
We went on to explain that subclause 
(II) of section 1853(l)(3)(B)(i) of the Act 
further states that to the extent an MA 
EP is entitled to less than the maximum 
incentive payment under the Medicare 
FFS EHR incentive program, that 
payment is to be made solely under the 
MA provision. In other words, we will 
need to withhold Medicare FFS 
incentive payments from EPs of less 
than the maximum to the extent such 
professionals are also identified as MA 
EPs under section 1853(l)(2) of the Act. 
Again, we would need to await the 
computation of payments due EPs under 
the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program before we can determine 
whether the EP is entitled to less than 
the maximum payment amount under 
the Medicare FFS EHR program, in 
which case any incentive payment for 
the EP will only be made to the 
qualifying MA organization under the 
MA EHR program, and not to the EP 
under the Medicare FFS EHR program. 
We also said that section 
1853(m)(3)(B) of the Act states that 
incentive payments for qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals are to be 
made under either the Medicare FFS 
hospital incentive payment program, or 
under the MA hospital incentive 
payment program. If more than 33 
percent of discharges or bed-days of all 
Medicare patients for a year are covered 
under Part A, then payment for that year 
is to only be made under section 
1886(n) of the Act—the Medicare FFS 
EHR incentive program—and no 
payment is to be made under the MA 
hospital incentive payment program. 
Otherwise, to the extent less than 33 
percent of bed days of all Medicare 
patients for an incentive payment year 
are covered under Part A, then payment 
for that incentive payment year may be 
made under the MA EHR incentive 
payment program. 
Unlike the process we proposed to 
follow related to qualifying EPs (where 
we will wait for the Medicare FFS 
incentive payment program to compute 
eligible physician incentive payments 
due under that program before 
determining the amount due under the 
MA EHR incentive program), we would 
not need to rely on Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive payment program calculations 
before determining eligibility for MA- 
affiliated hospital incentive payments. 
We said we would reimburse all 
hospitals, including MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals, under the Medicare 
FFS hospital incentive program. We 
believe that by doing so, we will prevent 
duplicate payments being made for the 
same hospitals by Medicare FFS and the 
MA incentive payment programs. To the 
extent that qualifying MA organizations 
are to receive incentive payments 
through the MA program rather than 
through their hospitals under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program 
due to a lack of sufficient data to make 
payments under the FFS program, we 
would identify and reimburse only 
appropriate qualifying MA 
organizations for qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals. Such 
reimbursement will be in a manner 
similar to the manner in which the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program 
will reimburse eligible hospitals due an 
incentive payment under the Medicare 
FFS EHR incentive program. 
Finally, we said that in order to avoid 
duplicate payments and in accordance 
with section 1853(m)(3)(B)(ii)(II) of the 
Act, we will not make MA EHR hospital 
incentive payments to qualifying MA 
organizations for MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals other than through the 
Medicare FFS EHR hospital incentive 
payment program without first ensuring 
that no such payments under the 
Medicare FFS EHR hospital incentive 
payments were made. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
6. Meaningful User Attestation 
We proposed meaningful user 
attestation requirements in § 495.210.

hospital for which a qualified MA 
organization seeks an incentive

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
payment, the organization must attest, 
in a form and manner specified by us, 
that its MA EPs and MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals are meaningful EHR 
users, as required by sections 1853(l)(6) 
and 1853(m)(1) of the Act. We further 
proposed to adopt the definitions of 
meaningful user under the Medicare 
FFS program related to EPs and eligible 
hospitals in § 495.4. We are requiring 
qualifying MA organizations to attest 
each payment year whether each of its 
MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals for which it is seeking an 
incentive payment was a meaningful 
EHR user for the EHR reporting period 
for a payment year. A qualifying MA 
organization must make this attestation 
for each payment year for which it is 
seeking an incentive payment for MA 
EPs and MA-affiliated eligible hospitals. 
We believe attestations should occur 
toward the end of a year with respect to 
that year, since qualifying MA 
organizations will need to attest to, 
based on our proposed rule, meaningful 
use for the appropriate duration and 
during the appropriate period related to 
MA EPs and MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals before claiming incentive 
payments for them. 
In the proposed rule we said that 
unlike the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program, where we will require the 
reporting of clinical quality measures— 
see § 495.8—we will not require 
qualifying MA organizations to submit 
clinical quality measures per section 
1848(o)(2)(B) of the Act, with respect to 
EPs, and section 1886(n)(3)(B) of the 
Act, with respect to eligible hospitals. 
Consistent with sections 
1848(o)(2)(B)(iii) and 1886(n)(3)(B)(iii) 
of the Act, we note that qualifying MA 
organizations sponsoring coordinated 
care MA plans are already required to 
submit Healthcare Effectiveness Data 
and Information Set (HEDIS), Health 
Outcomes Survey (HOS), and Consumer 
Assessment of Healthcare Providers and 
Systems (CAHPS) measures per 
§ 422.152 and § 422.516. Coordinated 
care MA plans include HMO, PPO and 
RPPO (Regional PPO) plans. Beginning 
with CY 2010, PFFS and MSA plans 
will also be required to begin collecting 
and submitting administrative HEDIS 
measures. 
We believe that all qualifying MA 
organizations will be organizations 
offering MA coordinated care plans, and 
therefore; those MA organizations from 
which we routinely receive complete 
HEDIS dataset reporting. Pursuant to 
sections 1848(o)(2)(B)(iii) and 
1886(n)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act, for clinical 
quality measures which overlap 
between the existing MA quality 
reporting program and under the EHR 
incentive program, we proposed to 
allow qualifying MA organizations to 
continue reporting under the existing 
MA quality reporting program. For those 
HITECH clinical quality measures that 
do not overlap and that are appropriate 
for the MA program, we are considering 
requiring that qualifying MA 
organizations that receive an incentive 
payment report those measures to CMS. 
This would ensure that clinical quality 
measure reporting under HITECH is 
consistent between the FFS program 
and MA. An alternative approach would 
be to require that qualifying MA 
organizations that receive an incentive 
payment report all of the HITECH 
clinical quality measures under section 
II.A.2 of this final rule that are 
appropriate for the MA program directly 
to CMS, while also reporting those 
HEDIS, HOS, and CAHPS measures 
under the existing MA quality program. 
This may result in duplicative reporting 
under the HITECH program and current 
MA quality reporting, but may provide 
us with more direct access to quality 
data under the HITECH program. We 
invite public comment on these 
approaches, including alternative 
methods to consistently treat MA- 
affiliated providers and FFS providers 
under the HITECH Medicare incentive 
program. 
Comment: The meaningful use criteria 
make reference to checking eligibility 
electronically and submitting claims 
electronically for 80 percent of patients 
seen. This would not be possible for us 
because, for most of our visits, there is 
no insurance company with which to 
check, and there is no eligibility to 
submit claims to. We are a capitated 
system and for most of the patient visits, 
the concept of checking eligibility and 
submitting claims in not relevant. 
Response: This comment points out 
the difficulty in adopting FFS Medicare 
meaningful use measures for qualifying 
MA organizations, MA-affiliated 
hospitals and MA EPs. For purposes of 
determining meaningful use in a 
Medicare Advantage environment, we 
agree that submitting claims 
electronically is not a useful standard in 
a capitated environment where virtually 
all patients are members of the same 
insurance plan. 
Comment: One commenter said that 
given the sensitivity of the data, and the 
RHQDAPU program specifications, the 
commenter believes CMS should never 
request that hospitals submit patient- 
level data to CMS, but that the data 
submitted should always be at the 
aggregated, summary level. The 
commenter encouraged us to state 
specifically that this is its intention in 
FY 2012 and all future years of EHR 
incentive program reporting. Some other 
commenters said that their health care 
delivery systems were based on an 
integrated care delivery model, where 
coordination of care is supported 
through program-wide EHR 
implementation that enables a patient’s 
medical record to be shared among the 
members of the patient’s care team. The 
commenters said they believed patient- 
centric electronic medical record 
models that integrate clinical 
information across providers align with 
goals of ONC’s Strategic Plan and reform 
efforts that seek to enable more patient- 
centric integration of care. The 
commenters said that during any given 
reporting period under the EHR 
incentive payment program, patients 
may receive health care services from 
various providers (for example, the 
primary care physician, one or more 
specialists, nurse practitioners, etc.). 
The commenters said they had adopted 
program-wide policies and procedures 
for using their EHR system to promote 
coordinated delivery of care. Thus, the 
commenters said they intended to use 
their EHR system to support the 
functionality and care delivery criteria 
of meaningful use for all providers 
across their organizations. Within their 
organizations, they said, a single 
provider is never solely responsible for 
all the information in a given patient’s 
electronic medical record. In fact, they 
said, many providers may access the 
patient’s electronic record to view or 
add information, order tests or 
medications, review results, etc. They 
said the shared record makes it 
extremely difficult to reliably track all 
the meaningful use criteria to each EP 
in their organizations without adding 
additional administrative functionality 
to their systems that would do nothing 
to improve patient care. It would be 
inappropriate and not the intent of the 
EHR incentive payment program, they 
said they believed, to add unnecessary 
redundancy in care delivery (that is, 
providers re-entering correct 
demographic information to get ‘‘credit’’ 
for that measure). They said they 
intended to participate in the EHR 
incentive payment program under 
provisions for Medicare Advantage 
organizations. They went on to say that 
since the proposed rule states, ‘‘the 
qualifying MA organization must attest 
to the fact that each MA EP is a 
meaningful user of certified EHR 
technology * * *, ’’ they believed such 
attestation can be based on measuring 
criteria at a MA organizational level. 
While they acknowledged that meeting 
basic eligibility criteria is appropriate 
on an individual provider level (that is,

the MA EP must meet the same 
definition for EP under FFS, satisfy 
minimum hours per week delivering 
patient care services, not be hospital- 
based, etc.), they said they should be 
able to meet meaningful use criteria as 
a MA organization on behalf of all of 
their individual EPs, so long as they are 
able to demonstrate that their EHR 
system itself meets the criteria and its 
use is pervasive and consistent 
throughout their healthcare delivery 
sites. They recommended that where a 
patient’s electronic medical record is 
shared among a team of providers 
within a MA organization, the 
meaningful use criteria be measured on 
an organizational versus an individual 
provider level. As an alternative they 
proposed that for any provider who 
treats a given patient, if the criterion is 
met in that patient’s electronic record, 
all EPs who are members of the patient’s 
care delivery team would receive 
‘‘credit’’ for meeting that measure. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters in large part. We believe 
that continued reporting by qualifying 
MA organizations under the HEDIS 
program is the most appropriate way to 
protect personally identifiable patient 
information. We also believe that in 
integrated care delivery systems, it does 
not make sense to require specific 
individuals to enter specific data in 
order to obtain meaningful user status— 
especially in a Medicare Advantage 
environment where we will require only 
continued HEDIS reporting as a 
demonstration of meaningful use. 
Finally, we believe that reporting of 
clinical quality measures at the MA 
organization level is the most effective 
and appropriate means of attaining the 
ultimate goal of EHR adoption— 
improved patient outcomes and reduced 
healthcare costs. 
Comment: Some commenters said that 
the proposed rule states that, ‘‘unlike the 
Medicare FFS EHR Incentive Program, 
where we will require the reporting of 
clinical quality measures * * * we will 
not require qualifying MA organizations 
to submit clinical quality measures 
* * * with respect to EPs * * * and 
with respect to eligible hospitals * * *. 
[W]e note that qualifying MA 
organizations sponsoring coordinated 
care plans are already required to 
submit Healthcare Effectiveness Data 
and Information Set (‘‘HEDIS’’), Health 
Outcomes Survey (‘‘HOS’’), and 
Consumer Assessment of Healthcare 
Providers and Systems (‘‘CAHPS’’) 
measures.’’ The proposed rule suggests 
allowing MA organizations to continue 
reporting these measures, but also 
considers requiring that MA 
organizations report those HITECH 
clinical quality measures that do not 
overlap with these currently reported 
measures ‘‘and are appropriate for the 
MA program.’’ We believe this current 
reporting is both appropriate and 
sufficient to measure the clinical quality 
of MA programs and should be deemed 
to satisfy the clinical quality reporting 
requirements under the EHR incentive 
payment program. HEDIS, HOS and 
CAHPS reporting are well-established 
and subject to audit. The measures are 
specifically chosen to capture quality 
within MA organizations, in particular 
to measure the clinical quality of the 
team approach we use to deliver care. 
While we support consistency across 
the EHR incentive payment program, we 
are concerned that requiring MA 
organizations to create new mechanisms 
for this additional reporting would be 
unduly burdensome, especially if these 
additional measures would have to be 
reported at the individual provider or 
patient level. Another commenter said 
that their considerable experience with 
developing responses for new measures 
demonstrated how resource and labor 
intensive clinical quality measurement 
can be. For example, the commenter 
continued, during a recent effort to 
automate ten TJC (The Joint 
Commission) measures, we identified 87 
data elements, only 37 of which are 
captured as discrete data. Of the 
remaining 50 measures, some are 
captured using discrete data in different 
places in the EHR, and some are 
captured using free text (for example, 
clinical trials and other irregular 
exclusion criteria) and will require the 
creation of new documentation tools. 
We estimate it will take one to two years 
of work for these ten measures to be 
fully automated, despite our relatively 
sophisticated use of data warehousing 
tools and our high level of automation 
in the data management process. The 
burden is especially heavy when 
measurement elements are ill-defined. 
Under meaningful use clinical quality 
reporting, over 120 measures have been 
proposed. Of these, 94 would be 
measures not currently calculated or 
reported on a routine basis. We 
anticipate a considerable increase in 
workload to create and maintain these 
measures. Adding new and duplicate— 
possibly less reliable—measures and 
reporting systems will be costly, time- 
consuming and may not have an 
incrementally significant impact on 
improving patient care. While we are 
not opposed to new metrics (those 
without similar known specifications), 
such measures should be field tested 
prior to becoming requirements; in 
particular, subject to rigorous testing of 
the electronic specifications. Such 
measures should also be supported by 
robust clinical evidence to show they 
will impact clinical outcomes. MA 
organizations should be deemed to have 
satisfied all clinical quality reporting 
required in the EHR incentive payment 
program by meeting their current 
reporting requirements. If additional 
measures are required, we recommend 
staged adoption, beginning with those 
measures that MA organizations already 
report or can report in the near future. 
We recommend eliminating measures 
that have little or no evidence to link 
them to improved outcomes. Overall, 
we strongly recommend that CMS 
significantly reduce the overall number 
of clinical quality measures that would 
be required for meaningful use. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters and believe that HEDIS, 
HOS and CAHPS are the appropriate 
means of reporting measures for both 
MA EPs and MA-affiliated hospitals. 
Where appropriate we will consider 
adding elements to these already 
existing quality reporting programs. We 
will consider adding HEDIS elements 
over time, as experience and clinical 
data warrant. 
Comment: One commenter said one of 
the five priorities specified by CMS is to 
improve care coordination. However, 
the siloed nature of the incentive 
payments, lack of a robust set of care 
coordination measures, and the narrow 
definition of eligible professionals do 
not fully support this priority. The 
commenter also said that the current 
structure of the proposed incentive 
program, as required by statute, 
maintains the current siloed structure of 
Medicare and Medicaid payments. The 
selected functionality and quality 
measures in large part do the same. 
However, this siloed structure does not 
support or encourage integrated 
coordinated care across providers and 
settings. As greater attention is paid to 
improving care coordination and the 
quality of care through integrated care 
models (for example, accountable care 
organizations, patient-centered medical 
homes), greater attention should be 
given to selecting measures that focus 
on patient-centered episodes of care. 
Furthermore, consideration should be 
given to refining the incentive payment 
structure to foster integration and 
accountability among and across 
providers and settings. 
Response: We believe that HEDIS 
reporting and other existing quality 
reporting programs (that is, HOS and 
CAHPS) go a long way toward assuring 
that coordination and integration of care 
will continue to occur in the Medicare 
Advantage environment. One of the

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
purposes of EHR adoption is to facilitate 
the coordination of care in health care 
environments where care coordination 
is not currently perceived to occur. We 
are asking providers to pick a program 
through which they are most likely to be 
eligible for EHR incentive payments. For 
MA organizations that treat Medicare, 
Medicaid and dually-eligible patients, 
EHR incentive payments will be made 
only under one program (Medicare or 
Medicaid) with respect to any specific 
EP. However care coordination should 
occur regardless of health insurance or 
EHR incentive payer. After 
consideration of the public comments 
received we are not changing our 
proposed policy to allow qualifying MA 
organizations to establish meaningful 
use through attestation and to 
demonstrate meaningful use through 
continued HEDIS reporting. 
Finally, we proposed requiring 
qualifying MA organizations to submit 
attestations to us related to meaningful 
use by MA-affiliated hospitals within 30 
days of the close of the FFY—which is 
the payment year for MA-affiliated 
hospitals—by October 30. We also 
proposed requiring qualifying MA 
organization to submit attestations to us 
related to meaningful use by MA EPs 
within 30 days of the close of the MA 
EP payment year—which is a CY—by 
January 30. In this final rule we are 
modifying the regulation text at 
§ 495.210(b) and (c) to be consistent 
with the changes to § 495.204(b)(2) and 
§ 495.202(b)(3), since the deadline for 
attestations of meaningful use should be 
consistent with deadlines for revenue 
reporting for MA EPs, and final 
identification of MA EPs and MA- 
affiliated hospitals. We are extending 
the timeframe for reporting meaningful 
use to 60 days after the close of the 
payment year. 
7. Posting Information on the CMS Web 
Site 
In the proposed rule we said that 
sections 1853(l)(7) and 1853(m)(5) of the 
Act require us to post information on an 
Internet Web site related to the receipt 
of incentive payments under the MA 
EHR incentive program. We said posted 
information would include the names, 
business addresses, and business phone 
numbers of each qualifying MA 
organization receiving an incentive 
payment under this section for 
qualifying MA EPs and hospitals. A list 
of the names of each qualifying MA EP 
and qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospital for which an incentive payment 
has been made would also be posted. 
Since this requirement is applicable to 
other Medicare EPs and eligible 
hospitals, we have included this 
requirement in § 495.108. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
8. Limitation on Review 
In the proposed rule we said that 
section 1853(l)(8) of the Act states that 
there shall be no administrative or 
judicial review under section 1869 of 
the Act, section 1878 of the Act, or 
otherwise of the methodology and 
standards for determining payment 
amounts and payment adjustments 
under the MA EHR EP incentive 
program. We said this includes 
provisions related to duplication of 
payment avoidance and rules developed 
related to the fixed schedule for 
application of limitation on incentive 
payments for all qualifying MA EPs 
related to a specific qualifying MA 
organization. This also includes the 
methodology and standards developed 
for determining qualifying MA EPs and 
the methodology and standards for 
determining a meaningful EHR user, 
including the means of demonstrating 
meaningful use and the selection of 
measures. We proposed to codify these 
requirements in § 495.212(b). 
Section 1853(m)(6) of the Act, as 
added by the HITECH Act, states that 
there shall be no administrative or 
judicial review under section 1869, 
section 1878, or otherwise of the 
methodology and standards for 
determining payment amounts and 
payment adjustments under the MA 
EHR hospital incentive program. This 
includes provisions related to 
duplication of payment. This also 
includes the methodology and standards 
developed for determining qualifying 
MA hospitals and the methodology and 
standards for determining a meaningful 
EHR user, including the means of 
demonstrating meaningful use and the 
selection of measures. We proposed to 
codify these requirements in 
§ 495.212(c). 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
9. Conforming Changes 
In the proposed rule we said that 
sections 4101(e) and 4201(d)(2) and (3) 
of the HITECH Act provide conforming 
amendments to Part C of the Social 
Security Act. Therefore, we proposed 
the following conforming changes to the 
regulations text: 
• Revising § 422.304 by adding a new 
paragraph (f) to account for the 
amendment to section 1853(a)(1)(A) of 
the Act referencing the additional EHR 
incentive payments that may be made to 
qualifying MA organizations in the 
section of the statute that provides for 
monthly capitation payments to MA 
organizations. (This addition would also 
act as a cross-reference to MA EHR 
incentive payment rules in subpart C of 
part 495 of this chapter.) 
• Revising § 422.306(b)(2) by adding a 
new paragraph (iv) to address the 
amendments to section 1853(c)(1)(D)(i) 
of the Act which exclude the EHR 
incentive payments made to EPs and 
hospitals under the Medicare FFS 
program from the computation of FFS 
costs in a year for the purpose of 
computing MA monthly capitation 
amounts. 
• Revising § 422.308 by adding a new 
paragraph (a)(1) to address the 
amendments to section 1853(c)(1)(D)(1) 
and (c)(6)(A) of the Act regarding the 
exclusion of FFS Medicare EHR 
incentive payments and adjustments 
from the calculation of the national per 
capita growth percentage. 
• Revising § 422.322 by adding a new 
paragraph (a)(3) to account for the 
amendments to section 1853(c)(6)(A) 
and (f) of the Act specifying that the 
source of EHR incentive payments to 
qualifying MA organizations are from 
the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust 
Fund or the Supplementary Medical 
Insurance Trust Fund. 
• Revising § 422.322(b) by adding a 
reference to § 495.204 to address the 
amendment to section 1851(i)(1) of the 
Act that indicates that EHR incentive 
payments are instead of incentive 
payments that would otherwise be 
payable under original Medicare. 
We did not receive any comments on 
these provisions and are finalizing them 
as proposed. 
10. Payment Adjustment and Future 
Rulemaking 
In the proposed rule we said that in 
future rulemaking we will develop 
standards related to payment 
adjustments to qualifying MA 
organizations related to MA EPs and 
MA-affiliated eligible hospitals that are 
not meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology. We solicited comment on 
how we can most effectively and 
efficiently apply payment adjustments 
to qualifying MA organizations whose 
MA eligible EPs and hospitals have not 
successfully meaningfully used certified 
EHR technology. 
The statutory requirement related to 
imposition of payment adjustments with 
respect to MA EPs is set forth in section 
1853(l) of the Act. Specifically, section 
1853(l)(4) of the Act requires that 
instead of applying the payment 
adjustment in section 1848(a)(7) of the 
Act, we apply the payment adjustment

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
to the Medicare physician expenditure 
proportion. This is our estimate of the 
proportion of the expenditures under 
Parts A and B paid to the qualifying MA 
organization in the form of capitation 
payments under section 1853 of the Act 
that are not attributable to the EHR 
incentive payment program, that are 
attributable to expenditures for 
physician services. In the case of a 
qualifying MA organization that attests 
that not all MA EPs of the organization 
are meaningful EHR users with respect 
to years beginning with 2015, we are 
directed to apply the payment 
adjustment on the proportion of the 
capitation payment with respect to all 
such EPs of the organization that are not 
meaningful users for such year. The 
adjustment amount is 1 percent for 
2015, 2 percent in 2016, and 3 percent 
in 2017 and subsequent years. 
Comment: Two commenters said that 
the EHR Incentive Program (the 
Medicare component) is limited to 
providers who bill for Part B covered 
services under traditional FFS Medicare 
or for MA organizations that provide 
equivalent services to MA beneficiaries. 
In addition to incentive payments, the 
program will impose penalties on 
providers who do not adopt technology 
and meet criteria for meaningful use of 
electronic health records; those 
penalties will be in the form of 
percentage reductions in Medicare 
reimbursements, beginning in 2016. 
Medicare section 1876 (of the Act) cost 
contract programs by statute are not 
eligible for the EHR Incentive Program. 
The proposed rule does not expressly 
state whether physicians paid under a 
cost plan will be required to meet 
meaningful use criteria to avoid the 
payment adjustments that will take 
effect after 2015. CMS should clearly 
state that those providers who are not 
eligible to participate in the EHR 
Incentive Program will not be subject to 
reductions in payment for not achieving 
meaningful use, for instance any 
providers reimbursed under Medicare 
cost contract arrangements. 
Response: While it is true that current 
statute applies payment adjustments 
beginning in 2015 only to FFS and MA 
providers, it is also true that cost plan 
providers might provide either FFS or 
MA services to which adjustments 
would apply. So, while it is true that 
cost plan payments are unaffected, a 
blanket statement that cost plan 
providers are unaffected is not possible. 
The statutory requirement related to 
imposition of payment adjustments with 
respect to MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals is provided in section 1853(m) 
of the Act. Specifically, section 
1853(m)(4) of the Act requires us to 
apply the adjustment to the hospital 
expenditure proportion, which is our 
estimate of the proportion of the 
expenditures under Parts A and B paid 
to the qualifying MA organization in the 
form of capitation payments under 
section 1853 of the Act that are not 
attributable to the EHR incentive 
payment program, that are attributable 
to expenditures for inpatient hospital 
services. In the case of a qualifying MA 
organization that attests that not all MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals of the 
organization are meaningful EHR users 
with respect to years beginning with 
2015, we are directed to apply the 
payment adjustment on the proportion 
of all such MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals of the organization that are not 
meaningful users for such year. The 
adjustment amount is of three-fourths of 
the market basket increase related to a 
hospital by a 331⁄3 percent reduction in 
2015, by a 662⁄3 percent reduction in 
2016, and by a 100 percent reduction in 
2017 and all subsequent years. 
Effectively, the reduction is of all but 25 
percent of the market basket increase for 
a specific hospital in years after 2016. 
We received no additional comments. 
D. Medicaid Incentives 
1. Overview of Health Information 
Technology in Medicaid 
Under the HITECH Act, State 
Medicaid programs, at their option, may 
receive Federal financial participation 
(FFP) for expenditures for incentive 
payments to certain Medicaid providers 
to adopt, implement, upgrade, and 
meaningfully use certified EHR 
technology. Additionally, FFP is 
available to States for reasonable 
administrative expenses related to 
administration of those incentive 
payments as long as the State meets 
certain conditions. Section 
1903(a)(3)(F)(i) of the Act, as amended 
by section 4201 of the HITECH Act, 
establishes 100 percent FFP to States for 
providing incentive payments to eligible 
Medicaid providers (described in 
section 1903(t)(2) of the Act) to adopt, 
implement, upgrade, and meaningfully 
use certified EHR technology. The 
incentive payments are not direct 
reimbursement for the purchase and 
acquisition of such technology, but 
rather are intended to serve as 
incentives for EPs and eligible hospitals 
to adopt and meaningfully use certified 
EHR technology. 
Section 1903(a)(3)(F)(ii) of the Act, as 
amended by section 4201 of the HITECH 
Act, also establishes 90 percent FFP to 
States for administrative expenses 
related to carrying out the substantive 
requirements associated with the 
incentive payments. 
Finally, as required by section 
1903(t)(10) of the Act, CMS will be 
reporting to Congress on the status, 
progress, and oversight of the overall 
EHR incentive program. These reports 
will discuss steps taken to avoid 
duplicate Medicare and Medicaid 
incentive payments to EPs, the extent to 
which Medicaid EPs and hospitals have 
adopted certified EHR technology as a 
result of the incentive payments, and 
any improvements in health outcomes, 
clinical quality, or efficiency resulting 
from the adoption of such technology. 
Comment: A commenter requested 
additional discussion in the final rule of 
the many challenges that exist to 
adopting electronic health record 
technology experienced by the Medicaid 
Transformation Grantees. 
Response: The primary challenges 
faced by the Medicaid Transformation 
Grantees involved assisting providers to 
adopt the EHRs and to successfully 
integrate utilization of the EHRs into 
their practice workflow. Workflow 
redesign is unique to each practice 
based upon practice size, clinical 
specialty area, practice operation (for 
example, medical home teams or 
specialty care) and the providers’ 
hardware and software. In addition, 
Grantees reported that providers value 
the EHRs only in so far as the patient 
data in the EHR is timely and complete. 
Therefore lagging data feeds or gaps in 
data from certain sources, such as labs 
or Part D claims for dual eligibles, were 
observed to discourage providers from 
investing their time and effort into 
learning how to use the EHRs. Many 
Grantees noted that early negative 
experiences with workflow or with 
timely and accurate access to relevant 
data discouraged providers from using 
the system. They reported needing to 
dedicate significant time and resources 
to provider outreach, technical 
assistance and training. Some Grantees 
focused on identifying or developing the 
right EHR product only to conclude 
afterwards that their focus needed to be 
equally, if not more, on supporting their 
providers’ use of the EHR, including 
fostering health information exchange 
through interface development. In 
summary, the Medicaid Transformation 
Grantees affirmed that the barriers faced 
by Medicaid providers to EHR adoption 
and use were not unique to Medicaid. 
There were several challenges to HIT/ 
EHR implementation that were specific 
to Medicaid programs that may be 
useful for States in light of HITECH. 
These include, integration of HIT into 
the State Medicaid Management 
Information System (MMIS); churning

of Medicaid patients on/off Medicaid 
eligibility; issues of consent with 
patients with diminished capacity, 
children and their parents and 
caregivers, and foster children/wards of 
the State; costs associated with 
transaction fees for pharmacy hubs on a

return on investment and quality 
outcomes as a result of HIT programs 
that are running concurrent with other 
quality initiatives with the same goals, 
such as the medical home model, 
disease management/care coordination 
and provider pay-for-performance. 
While this information is valuable in 
terms of understanding and addressing 
the challenges to EHR adoption, we 
continue to believe that the benefits of 
meaningful use of EHRs far outweigh 
the implementation challenges. 
2. General Medicaid Provisions 
In § 495.320 and § 495.322 we provide 
the general rule that States, at their 
option, may receive: (1) 90 percent FFP 
for State expenditures related to the 
administration of an EHR incentive 
program for certain Medicaid providers 
that are adopting, implementing, or 
upgrading and meaningfully using 
certified EHR technology; and (2) 100 
percent FFP for State expenditures for 
those incentive payments. 
We did not receive any comments and 
we are finalizing these provisions as 
proposed. 
3. Identification of Qualifying Medicaid 
EPs and Eligible Hospitals 
a. Overview 
As specified in section 1903(t)(2) of 
the Act, only certain Medicaid providers 
will be eligible for incentive payments. 
This section discusses some of these 
eligibility requirements, including 
requirements relating to patient volume, 
whether a provider is hospital-based, 
and whether an EP is practicing 
predominantly in a federally-qualified 
health center (FQHC) or a rural health 
clinic (RHC). Regulations relating to 
these requirements may be found at 
§ 495.304 through § 495.306. 
b. Program Participation 
As specified under section 
1903(t)(2)(A) of the Act, Medicaid 
participating providers who wish to 
receive a Medicaid incentive payment 
must meet the definition of a ‘‘Medicaid 
EP.’’ This definition (1903(t)(3)(B) of the 
Act) lists five types of Medicaid 
professionals: Physicians, dentists, 
certified nurse-midwives, nurse 
practitioners, and physician assistants 
practicing in an FQHC or RHC that is so 
led by a physician assistant. 
Additionally, to qualify for incentives, 
most Medicaid EPs cannot be ‘‘hospital- 
based.’’ We will use the same definition 
of ‘‘hospital-based’’ as used in the 
Medicare EHR incentive program, as 
sections 1848(o)(1)(C) and 1903(t)(3)(D) 
of the Act use almost identical 
definitions of the term. We refer readers 
to section II.A. for a definition of 
‘‘hospital-based,’’ and for a thorough 
discussion of our methodology. 
The only exception to this rule is that 
Medicaid EPs practicing predominantly 
in an FQHC or RHC are not subject to 
the hospital-based exclusion. 
Medicaid EPs must also meet the 
other criteria for Medicaid incentive 
payment eligibility, such as the patient 
volume thresholds or practicing 
predominantly in an FQHC or RHC, as 
described in this subpart. Since the 
statute at 1903(t)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act 
does not define ‘‘practices 
predominantly,’’ we specify that an EP 
practices predominantly at an FQHC or 
an RHC when the clinical location for 
over 50 percent of his or her total 
patient encounters over a period of 6 
months occurs at an FQHC or RHC. 
Acute care and children’s hospitals 
are listed in section 1903(t)(2) of the Act 
as the only two types of institutional 
providers potentially eligible for 
Medicaid incentive payments. These 
terms are specific to the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program and are not currently 
defined in the Medicaid regulations. 
Consequently, we define these terms in 
§ 495.302. 
As specified under section 
1903(t)(2)(B) of the Act, to qualify for 
incentive payments acute care hospitals 
also must meet patient volume 
threshold requirements, as specified in 
§ 495.306. Children’s hospitals do not 
have patient volume requirements for 
Medicaid incentive program 
participation. 
Comment: Commenters expressed 
confusion about the restrictions on 
physician assistants’ (PAs) 
participation. Numerous commenters 
suggested that PAs should be eligible 
without conditions, particularly the 
condition that they are practicing in an 
FQHC or RHC that is ‘‘so led by a 
physician assistant’’ and/or CMS should 
exercise flexibility in defining ‘‘so led,’’ 
in order to capture the highest number 
of PAs. We received specific comments 
on how to define ‘‘so led’’ to provide the 
greatest flexibility to PAs. Suggestions 
included allowing clinics under a larger 
FQHC to be led by a PA, but not 
necessarily the entire FQHC. Also, 
commenters asked that we consider 
‘‘led’’ to mean the dominant clinical 
provider, which is the case for PAs in 
many RHCs. 
Response: As stated in the statute at 
1903(t)(3)(B)(v), regarding the program 
eligibility for PAs, PAs are eligible when 
they are a ‘‘physician assistant insofar as 
the assistant is practicing in a rural 
health clinic that is led by a physician 
assistant or is practicing in a Federally 
qualified health center that is so led.’’ 
These conditions on PAs’ eligibility 
apply whether the PA is qualifying 
because they meet Medicaid patient 
volume requirements or if they are 
qualifying because they practice 
predominantly in an FQHC or RHC. 
Since this language requiring that a PA 
must be leading the FQHC or RHC is 
derived from statute, we have no 
flexibility to change or remove it. 
However, we agree that we have the 
authority to interpret what it means for 
a PA to lead an FQHC or RHC, and we 
believe a PA would be leading an FQHC 
or RHC under any of the following 
circumstances: 
(1) When a PA is the primary provider 
in a clinic (for example, when there is 
a part-time physician and full-time PA, 
we would consider the PA as the 
primary provider); 
(2) When a PA is a clinical or medical 
director at a clinical site of practice; or 
(3) When a PA is an owner of an RHC. 
We agree that FQHCs and RHCs that 
have PAs in these leadership roles can 
be considered ‘‘PA-led.’’ Furthermore, 
since RHCs can be practitioner owned 
(FQHCs cannot), we will allow 
ownership to be considered ‘‘PA-led.’’ 
With the exception of this 
clarification of PA-led, we are adopting 
this language as proposed. We have not 
changed our regulatory language, as we 
consider this clarification to be an 
interpretation of our regulations as to 
what it means to be a PA to be leading 
an FQHC or RHC. 
Comment: We received questions 
about eligibility related to FQHC look- 
alikes, tribal clinics, and other similar 
facilities. 
Response: As previously mentioned, 
in accordance with section 1903(t)(2)(B), 
the only two facilities eligible for 
incentives are acute care and children’s 
hospitals. However, EPs at facilities 
such as FQHCs, RHCs, and tribal clinics 
may be eligible for participation when 
they practice predominantly at an FQHC 
or RHC or meet the other patient volume 
requirements. The statute defines 
FQHCs at 1905(l)(2)(B) and defines 
RHCs at 1905(l)(1) by essentially 
incorporating the definition in 1861(aa). 
Comment: Numerous commenters 
opposed the proposed definition for 
‘‘hospital-based.’’ 
Response: This is a consideration for 
Medicare and Medicaid and is 
addressed in II.A.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are making 
changes under II.A. 
(1) Acute Care Hospitals 
For purposes of Medicaid incentive 
payments, we proposed to define an 
‘‘acute care hospital’’ as a health care 
facility where the average length of 
patient stay is 25 days or fewer and with 
a CCN that has the last four digits in the 
series 0001 through 0879 (that is, short- 
term general hospitals and the 11 cancer 
hospitals in the United States). 
We excluded from this proposed 
definition a category of long-term care 
hospitals, which are defined for 
Medicare purposes in regulations at 
§ 412.23(e). Specifically § 412.23(e)(2)(i) 
states that the hospital must have an 
average Medicare inpatient length of 
stay of greater than 25 days (which 
includes all covered and non-covered 
days of stay of Medicare patients). 
Comment: We received numerous 
comments recommending that CAHs be 
included in the definition of acute care 
hospitals for purposes of the Medicaid 
EHR incentive payment program. 
Commenters pointed out that the CAHs 
would qualify on all criteria except for 
the requirement to have a CCN in the 
range 0001–0879. CAHs have CCNs in 
the range 1300–1399. Moreover, many 
commenters pointed out that, because of 
their rural location and distance from 
other hospitals to which they frequently 
transfer patients, the CAHs would 
benefit from having electronic records 
that could be shared with the 
subsequent provider of care to the 
patient. Commenters also asked what 
reimbursement methodology CMS 
would use if it decided to include CAHs 
in the Medicaid incentive payment 
program. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that CAHs conform to our 
definitional criteria for acute care 
hospital except for the CCN range. 
Moreover, we recognize the positive 
impact on quality that may ensue from 
the CAH’s being able to electronically 
communicate with the hospitals to 
which it transfers patients. Therefore, in 
the final rule, we are amending the 
definition of acute care hospital for 
purposes of the Medicaid EHR incentive 
payment program as ‘‘those hospitals 
with an average patient length of stay of 
25 days or fewer, and with a CCN that 
falls in the range 0001–0879 or 1300– 
1399.’’ This definition will now 
encompass general short-term hospitals, 
cancer hospitals, and critical access 
hospitals that meet the Medicaid patient 
volume criteria. Since we are including 
CAHs under the category of ‘‘acute care 
hospital,’’ we are not developing a 
separate Medicaid incentive payment 
calculation for CAHs. States will pay the 
incentive payment to qualifying CAHs 
using the acute care methodology 
described at section 495.310(g). In 
summary, CAHs will be eligible for the 
Medicaid hospital incentive insofar as 
they meet the requirements under an 
acute care hospital described here. 
While the statute issued specific 
calculation requirements for CAHs 
under Medicare, there is no special 
Medicaid calculation. Like other acute 
care hospitals, some CAHs may be 
eligible for Medicare and Medicaid 
incentives. 
We will reflect this definitional 
change in the final regulation at section 
495.302. 
Comment: Further guidance was 
requested on the determination of 
average length of stay. Commenters 
questioned whether the average length 
of stay should be calculated relative to 
the fiscal year prior to the payment year 
or relative to the calendar year prior to 
the payment year. Commenters also 
questioned whether outliers in terms of 
extremely long length of stay could be 
left out of the calculation, and if so, 
could CMS provide detail on this and 
any similar exclusions; for example, 
other exclusions with respect to 
observation stays. 
Response: After consideration of these 
comments, we believe the best policy is 
to allow the States to decide whether 
they will use a fiscal year or calendar 
year for calculating length of stay, as the 
State will be in the best position to 
determine what documentation exists in 
order to support any length of stay 
calculation. With respect to outliers, we 
point readers to the State Operations 
Manual, page 303, Revision 57, dated 
January 29, 2010 and we note that these 
long (and short) stay outliers are 
included in average length of stay 
calculations for other purposes, such as 
reporting statistics to States, Medicare, 
and other payers. We do not find a basis 
for excluding outliers from the average 
length of stay for purposes of the 
incentive payment. In fact, since acute 
care hospitals have CCNs in either the 
0001–0879 or the 1300–1399 range, and 
length of stay is one of the definitional 
criteria for CCNs in these ranges, all of 
the acute care hospitals are very likely 
to meet length of stay criteria. 
Observation stays are considered to be 
outpatient services and, therefore, 
cannot be included in average length of 
stay calculations. This is consistent with 
the treatment of observation days under 
Medicare. 
In summary we are making no 
revisions to the regulation as a result of 
this comment. 
(2) Children’s Hospitals 
For purposes of the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program, in the proposed rule, 
we proposed one definition to include 
only separately certified children’s 
hospitals, with CCNs in the 3300–3399 
series in the definition of eligible 
‘‘children’s hospital.’’ By defining 
‘‘children’s hospital’’ in this way, we: (1) 
Prevented general acute care hospitals, 
which could not themselves qualify for 
the incentive because they did not meet 
the 10 percent Medicaid patient volume, 
from using the fact that they have a 
pediatric wing as justification for 
requesting a Medicaid incentive 
payment; (2) excluded many of the 
facilities that are perceived by the 
public as children’s hospitals, but do 
not meet the Medicare standards as 
either freestanding or hospital-within- 
hospital children’s hospitals; and (3) 
excluded some pediatric specialty 
hospitals which have CCNs as 
psychiatric or rehabilitation hospitals. 
An alternative definition of a 
‘‘children’s hospital’’ was also proposed 
to include those hospitals with 
Medicare provider numbers in the 
following series: 
• 0001 through 0879—Short-term 
(General and Specialty) Hospitals. 
• 3025 through 3099—Rehabilitation 
Hospitals (Excluded from Prospective 
Payment Systems). 
• 3300 through 3399—Children’s 
Hospitals (Excluded from Prospective 
Payment Systems). 
• 4000 through 4499—Psychiatric 
Hospitals (Excluded from Prospective 
Payment Systems). 
This definition, for the purposes of 
the Medicaid HIT incentive payments, 
applied only to those freestanding 
hospitals within the above mentioned 
series that exclusively furnish services 
to individuals under age 21. 
This broader definition still: (1) 
Prevented acute care hospitals that 
cannot independently qualify for the 
incentive because they do not meet the 
10 percent Medicaid patient volume 
from using the fact that they have a 
pediatric wing as justification for 
requesting an HIT incentive payment; 
(2) allowed for participation in the 
incentive program by the greatest 
number of children’s hospitals, 
including rehabilitative and psychiatric 
specialty hospitals; and (3) aligned with 
Federal efforts aimed at improving 
healthcare quality for all children, 
including those with physical and 
mental diseases/disabilities. 
Comment: CMS received several 
comments on this issue. Specifically, 
the commenters stated that the proposed 
rule limited the definition of children’s

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
hospitals to those that provide care to 
individuals under the age of 21; the 
commenters stated that children’s 
hospitals actually may provide care to 
older individuals who have conditions 
such as congenital cardiac problems, 
sickle cell disease and cystic fibrosis. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that children’s hospitals do 
on occasion treat patients who are over 
the age of 21, especially if the patient is 
on a continued course of treatment for 
a condition that began in childhood, 
such as those conditions mentioned. 
Accordingly, in the proposed rule 
published on January 13, 2010 at section 
495.302, we defined a children’s 
hospital for purposes of the HIT 
incentive payment program as a hospital 
that is separately certified as a 
children’s hospital, with a CCN in the 
3300–3399 series and predominantly 
treats individuals under the age of 21. 
We used the term ‘‘predominantly’’ to 
recognize that not all patients of the 
children’s hospital are in fact under age 
21. 
This definition addresses the 
commenters’ concerns and we are not 
revising it in the final rule. The 
commenter’s may have been responding 
to the alternate definition in which we 
requested comments. While that 
alternate definition mentioned specialty 
hospitals that exclusively treat 
individuals under the age of 21, we are 
not adopting that definition in this final 
rule, as noted in the response to the 
comment below. 
Comment: CMS also received a few 
comments that supported our proposed 
definition of children’s hospital as those 
that are separately certified and 
predominantly treating individuals 
under 21 years of age. The commenters 
urged us to adopt this definition rather 
than the alternate definition discussed 
in the proposed rule and on which we 
requested comments. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters and are adopting the 
definition that we originally proposed at 
section 495.302. See the response to the 
comment below. 
Comment: CMS received one 
comment that recommended use of the 
alternative definition as providing more 
opportunity for hospital participation. 
Response: We considered the merits 
of both definitions and we have decided 
to maintain the definition originally 
proposed in section 495.302 as 
representing the clearest definition of a 
children’s hospital. As previously 
stated, we only intend to include 
children’s hospitals with CCNs within a 
specific range; this will not include 
pediatric wings of larger hospitals. 
In summary, after considering the 
comments, we are adopting the 
definition of children’s hospital as 
originally proposed. 
c. Medicaid Professionals Program 
Eligibility 
For Medicaid EPs, the general rule 
(subject to the two exceptions listed 
below) is that the EP must have at least 
30 percent patient volume attributable 
to those who are receiving Medicaid. 
Section 1903(t)(2)(A)(i) of the Act 
provides authority to the Secretary to 
establish the methodology by which 
such patient volume will be estimated; 
our proposed methodologies which 
follow, are based on this discretion. To 
establish such patient volume, we 
proposed that the EP have a minimum 
of 30 percent of all patient encounters 
attributable to Medicaid over any 
continuous, representative 90-day 
period within the most recent calendar 
year prior to reporting. There are two 
statutory exceptions to the general 30 
percent rule discussed previously. The 
first exception is that a pediatrician may 
have at least 20 percent patient volume 
attributable to those who are receiving 
medical assistance under the Medicaid 
program, as estimated in accordance 
with a methodology established by the 
Secretary (section 1903(t)(2)(A)(ii) of the 
Act). Again, the method we proposed to 
use was that the pediatrician have a 
minimum 20 percent of all patient 
encounters attributable to Medicaid over 
any continuous, representative 90-day 
period within the most recent calendar 
year prior to reporting. 
The second exception is that 
Medicaid EPs practicing predominantly 
in an FQHC or RHC must have a 
minimum of 30 percent patient volume 
attributable to ‘‘needy individuals.’’ 
Again, the method we would use is that 
30 percent of all patient encounters be 
attributable to needy individuals over 
any continuous 90-day period within 
the most recent calendar year prior to 
reporting. 
Section 1903(t)(3)(F) of the Act 
defines needy individuals as 
individuals meeting any of the 
following three criteria: (1) They are 
receiving medical assistance from 
Medicaid or the Children’s Health 
Insurance Program (CHIP); (2) they are 
furnished uncompensated care by the 
provider; or (3) they are furnished 
services at either no cost or reduced cost 
based on a sliding scale determined by 
the individual’s ability to pay. 
Comment: Many commenters 
requested that CMS consider groups 
outside of the statute eligible for 
incentive payments. These facilities and 
practitioners included: Community 
mental health centers and other 
behavioral health providers (including 
psychiatric clinics); nursing homes, 
nursing facilities, and skilled nursing 
facilities; long-term care providers 
(community and institutional), 
including home health care providers; 
pharmacists and pharmacies; social 
workers; blood centers; provider based 
departments; professional societies; 
Medicaid-participating health plans; 
speech-language pathologists and 
audiologists; FQHCs, RHCs, tribal 
providers, and other community clinics; 
health aides; and podiatrists. The 
commenters included numerous 
testimonials, research, and statements to 
note that these providers are critical 
partners in improving the quality and 
coordination of care for the Medicaid 
population. Some of the commenters 
acknowledged that this is a statutory 
issue but assert that exclusion of such 
providers impacts Medicaid’s ability to 
improve the quality and efficiency of 
care. Furthermore, some of these 
commenters based several additional 
comments upon presumed eligibility. 
For example, some commenters said 
that social workers could not afford 
EHRs and should not be required to 
participate. 
Another group of comments came 
from health care professionals that 
sought eligibility for incentives by 
virtue of early adoption of EHRs but 
who do not participate in either 
Medicaid or Medicare. They suggested a 
third incentive option available for 
providers that either do not participate 
with Medicaid/Medicare or would not 
reach the threshold of patient visits to 
receive Medicaid incentive payments. 
Response: We note that the 
commenters are correct to recognize that 
this is a statutory issue. The definition 
of a ‘‘Medicaid EP,’’ at 1903(t)(3)(B) of 
the Act, lists five types of professionals 
that are eligible for Medicaid incentive 
payments: physicians, dentists, certified 
nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners, 
and physician assistants practicing in an 
FQHC that is led by a physician 
assistant or RHC that is so led. 
Additionally, the statute at 1903(t)(2)(B) 
designates acute care hospitals and 
children’s hospitals as the only two 
types of facilities eligible for the 
Medicaid incentives. These providers 
must also meet all other program 
requirements, including Medicaid 
patient volume thresholds. 
Since the commenters recommend 
including providers that are not among 
those explicitly mentioned in the 
statute, these providers cannot be 
eligible for the incentive payments. 
Additionally, professionals who do 
not participate in either Medicaid or

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Medicare are also not eligible for 
incentives due to the statutory 
requirements associated with each 
program. Specifically, the Medicaid 
incentives program requires providers to 
meet Medicaid patient volume 
thresholds or practice predominantly in 
an FQHC or RHC, where they must 
serve needy individuals (as defined at 
section 495.10). Additionally, the 
hospital calculations for Medicare and 
Medicaid are based, in part, on 
Medicare or Medicaid inpatient bed- 
days. For Medicare EPs, the incentive is 
based on the associated Medicare 
claims. Hence, these professionals 
cannot meet the statutory requirements 
for eligibility. 
After consideration of these 
comments, we are maintaining the list 
of providers eligible for the Medicaid 
incentive payment program as originally 
proposed and as identified by statute. 
It is worth noting that while the 
facilities recommended for inclusion by 
the commenters will not be considered 
eligible to participate in these 
incentives, some of the EPs at these 
facilities may be eligible. One example 
is that a psychiatrist (physician) or NP 
is likely to treat individuals at a 
behavioral health facility. Per our rules 
at section 495.10, the EP must identify 
a TIN to which the incentive payment 
should be made. We believe that, in 
accordance with 1903(t)(6)(A) of the 
Act, an EP could reassign payment to a 
TIN associated with his or her employer 
or the facility in which she or he works. 
This facility could be one of those 
recommended for inclusion by the 
commenters. Any reassignment of 
payment must be voluntary and we 
believe the decision as to whether an EP 
does reassign incentive payments to a 
specific TIN is an issue which EPs and 
these other parties should resolve. Any 
reassignment of payment must be 
consistent with applicable laws, rules, 
and regulations, including, without 
limitation, those related to fraud, waste 
and abuse. 
We have provided clarifying language 
at section 495.10(f) to further clarify the 
reassignment of incentive payments by 
EPs to specific TINs. 
d. Calculating Patient Volume 
Requirements 
As required by section 1903(t)(2) of 
the Act and discussed in the previous 
section, all EPs and the vast majority of 
hospitals will need to meet certain 
patient volume thresholds in order to be 
eligible for incentive payments. (The 
only exception to this rule is for 
children’s hospitals, which have no 
patient volume threshold requirement). 
In addition, where patient volume is 
a criterion, most providers will be 
evaluated according to their ‘‘Medicaid’’ 
patient volume, while some 
professionals (those practicing 
predominantly in an FQHC or RHC) will 
be evaluated according to their ‘‘needy 
individual’’ patient volume. 
We define ‘‘patient volume’’ in 
§ 495.302 to be a minimum participation 
threshold for each individual Medicaid 
provider (with the exception of 
children’s hospitals). In the proposed 
rule, we proposed methodologies for 
estimating the patient volume 
thresholds and listed them by entity 
type. 
Further, we proposed that States 
could submit alternative approaches to 
the established timeframe for estimating 
patient volume, through their State 
Medicaid HIT Plans (SMHP) and we 
would make a determination of whether 
it was an acceptable alternative. 
In determining the ‘‘needy individual’’ 
patient volume threshold that applies to 
EPs practicing predominantly in FQHCs 
or RHCs, section 1902(t)(2) of the Act 
authorizes the Secretary to require the 
downward adjustment to the 
uncompensated care figure to eliminate 
bad debt data. We interpret bad debt to 
be consistent with the Medicare 
definition, as specified at § 413.89(b)(1). 
In order to remain as consistent as 
possible between the Medicare and 
Medicaid EHR incentive programs, 
States will be required to downward 
adjust the uncompensated care figure. 
Under Medicare, bad debts are amounts 
considered to be uncollectible from 
accounts and notes receivable that were 
created or acquired in providing 
services. ‘‘Accounts receivable’’ and 
‘‘notes receivable’’ are designations for 
claims arising from the furnishing of 
services, and are collectible in money in 
the relatively near future. Providers 
should be required to use cost reports 
(for FQHCs and clinics this would be 
the Medicare 222–92 cost report, or the 
most recent version of the 222), or other 
auditable records to identify bad debts. 
All information under attestation is 
subject to audit. Our proposed 
regulations on calculating the needy 
individual patient volume can be found 
at § 495.302 and § 495.306. 
Further, in establishing the Medicaid 
patient volume thresholds for EPs and 
acute care hospitals, section 1902(t)(2) 
of the Act requires that individuals 
enrolled in a Medicaid managed care 
plan be included. We interpret this to 
mean that individuals enrolled in 
MCOs, prepaid inpatient health plans 
(PIHPs), or prepaid ambulatory health 
plans (PAHPs), under 42 CFR Part 438 
be included in the calculation. 
Therefore, in determining patient 
volume, providers and States should be 
aware that individuals enrolled in such 
plans will be included in the patient 
volume calculation. Acute care 
hospitals have to meet the 10 percent 
Medicaid volume threshold. 
Comment: Commenters recommended 
that CMS provide flexibility in the 
specific volume thresholds required for 
program participation (for example, 30 
percent for most EPs, 20 percent for 
pediatricians) and apply a lower 
percentage or a minimum number of 
encounters. Some commenters 
referenced research stating that 
practices with a 30 percent patient 
volume may not be financially viable. 
Response: The patient volume 
thresholds of 30 percent and 20 percent 
are required by statute and cannot be 
changed in the rulemaking process. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are not making 
any changes to these statutory 
requirements. 
Comment: Commenters suggested that 
CMS define ‘‘encounter’’ and take a 
menu approach to patient volume to 
allow States several options, based on 
their data sources. Some commenters 
provided specific suggestions for patient 
volume ‘‘menu’’ items. Some 
commenters further noted that there 
were inconsistencies in how we applied 
‘‘encounter’’ data. Finally, one 
commenter noted that we should 
consider how ‘‘encounter’’ data is 
applied to EPs that bill services through 
another provider (for example, PAs that 
bill through MDs). Other commenters 
asked for a clarification of how 
‘‘encounters’’ would apply to the dually- 
eligible Medicare/Medicaid 
beneficiaries. Additionally, several 
commenters provided specific 
suggestions for alternative methods 
making an approximate determination 
of providers’ patient volume by [not 
using patient volume] and extending the 
look-back period to two years. 
Response: We agree with the 
approach of offering at least some 
options to States regarding patient 
volume. This approach allows States to 
audit their programs using the data 
sources available to them, while also 
including the largest number of 
providers that may treat Medicaid 
patients. We believe our new approach 
will correct the inconsistencies in how 
we applied ‘‘encounter.’’ Furthermore, 
our new definition of encounter will 
capture the dually-eligible beneficiaries, 
as well as individuals who are in a Title 
XIX-funded 1115 demonstration project. 
Specifically, the statute at 1903(t)(2) 
states that Medicaid patient volume will 
be ‘‘attributable to individuals who are

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
receiving medical assistance under 
[Title XIX],’’ and also states that the 
patient volume calculation for those 
practicing predominantly in an FQHC or 
RHC will be ‘‘attributable to needy 
individuals.’’ Needy individual is 
defined at 1903(t)(3)(F) as ‘‘an 
individual—(i) who is receiving 
assistance under Title XIX; (ii) who is 
receiving assistance under Title XXI; 
(iii) who is furnished uncompensated 
care by the provider; or (iv) for whom 
charges are reduced by the provider on 
a sliding scale basis based on the 
individual’s ability to pay.’’ We believe 
our final rule definition of ‘‘encounter’’ 
captures care to all of these individuals. 
Additionally, consistent with the 
statute, we expect providers and States 
to make estimation in accordance with 
the methodologies we established here. 
This estimation would need to be made 
with reasonable effort, using verifiable 
data sources by the provider and the 
State. 
Finally, we do not agree with any of 
the suggestions from commenters that 
involve using a benchmark number of 
Medicaid patients or other suggestions 
that involve a deviation from the 
statutory language. The statute is clear 
that Medicaid patient volume must be 
considered and explicitly specified 
percentages of caseload mix 
compositions attributable to either 
Medicaid and/or ‘‘needy’’ individuals 
that must be achieved for participation 
in the incentive program. We also do 
not agree with allowing the provider to 
consider a period longer than a year 
prior to registering because that is not a 
current, accurate portrayal of the 
provider’s participation in Medicaid. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are revising the 
patient volume approach to the 
following two options. The State may 
choose one of the two options listed 
below (or both options), or a State- 
proposed alternative, if approved by 
CMS. The State’s strategy must be 
submitted for review and approval 
through the SMHP, in accordance with 
all requirements at section 495.332. 
A Medicaid provider may 
demonstrate patient volume by: 
(1) Having patient encounters within 
the 90-day period by using the same 
methodology we proposed in the 
proposed rule. 
This first option preserves the 
methodology we proposed in the 
proposed rule, however we clarify 
‘‘encounter’’ below. For the Medicaid 
patient volume, the methodology for 
estimating patient volume would 
require calculation of a threshold 
(represented below) using as the 
numerator the individual hospital’s or 
EP’s total number of Medicaid patient 
encounters in any representative 
continuous 90-day period in the 
preceding calendar year and the 
denominator is all patient encounters 
for the same individual professional or 
hospital over the same 90-day period. 
We are not prescribing standards for 
what is a ‘‘representative’’ period, but we 
intend to apply a plain meaning test. In 
other words, if a reasonable person 
would not consider the selected period 
to be representative (for example, 
because the selected period included a 
short-term temporary Medicaid outreach 
program), then it would not support a 
threshold calculation. 
[Total (Medicaid) patient encounters 
in any representative continuous 90-day 
period in the preceding calendar year/ 
Total patient encounters in that same 
90-day period] * 100 
For the needy individual patient 
volume, the methodology for estimating 
patient volume would require the same 
calculation, but with the numerator 
equal to the EP’s total number of needy 
individual patient encounters in any 
representative 90-day period in the 
preceding calendar year. 
[Total (Needy Individual) patient 
encounters in any representative 
continuous 90-day period in the 
preceding calendar year/Total patient 
encounters in that same 90-day period] 
* 100 
Table 15, below, demonstrates the 
above-referenced patient volume 
thresholds. (This same Table appeared 
in the proposed rule, with a few minor 
clarifications included in this Table). 
(2) Having a Medicaid enrollee on the 
panel assigned to the EP (for example, 
managed care or medical homes) within 
that representative 90-day period. 
With more than 70 percent of 
Medicaid and CHIP enrollees receiving 
care in a managed care delivery system, 
and additional enrollees in medical 
homes, we determined that it was 
necessary to look for flexibility in how 
we applied these requirements. Under 
this option, we wanted to capture the 
EP’s panel assignments, as well as any 
additional unduplicated Medicaid 
encounters. In other words, we do not 
intend for the EP to count an assigned 
patient who was also an encounter more 
than once. 
The methodology for estimating the 
Medicaid patient volume threshold 
(represented above) would use as the

care panel, medical or health home 
program panel, or similar provider 
structure with capitation and/or case 
assignment, plus all other Medicaid 
encounters for that EP. The assignment 
must be current within the 90-day 
period and we will consider as a proxy 
for this an encounter with any patient 
on the panel within the previous 
calendar year prior to the representative 
90-day period when the patient was on 
the panel. Note that, as stated above, 
while the EP may add in encounters 
with other, non-panel Medicaid patients 
to the numerator, these encounters must 
be patients who are not assigned to a 
panel and would be encounters that 
occurred during the representative 90- 
day period. The denominator is all 
patients assigned to the EP or hospital 
for the same 90-day period, also with 
whom the provider had at least one 
encounter in the prior calendar year as 
a proxy, as well as any other 
unduplicated Medicaid encounters 
during the representative 90-day period.

the provider in any representative

For the needy individual patient 
volume for EPs enrolled in managed 
care and medical homes, the threshold 
(represented below) would be calculated 
in the same manner, but with the 
numerator equal to the EP’s total 
number of needy individuals assigned 
to the patient panel in any 
representative 90-day period in the 
preceding calendar year with at least 
one encounter within that year.

Table 15 demonstrates the above- 
referenced patient volume thresholds 
per provider type. 
In order to resolve any inconsistencies 
with the definitions of ‘‘encounter,’’ for 
purposes of EP patient volume, we have 
allowed the following to be considered 
Medicaid encounters: 
(1) Services rendered on any one day 
to an individual where Medicaid or a 
Medicaid demonstration project under 
section 1115 of the Act paid for part or 
all of the service; or 
(2) Services rendered on any one day 
to an individual for where Medicaid or 
a Medicaid demonstration project under 
section 1115 of the Act paid all or part 
of their premiums, co-payments, and/or 
cost-sharing. 
For purposes of calculating hospital 
patient volume, we have allowed the 
following to be considered Medicaid 
encounters: 
(1) Services rendered to an individual 
per inpatient discharges where 
Medicaid or a Medicaid demonstration 
project under section 1115 paid for part 
or all of the service; 
(2) Services rendered to an individual 
per inpatient discharge where Medicaid 
or a Medicaid demonstration project 
under section 1115 of the Act paid all 
or part of their premiums, co-payments, 
and/or cost-sharing; 
(3) Services rendered to an individual 
in an emergency department on any one 
day where Medicaid or a Medicaid 
demonstration project under section 
1115 of the Act either paid for part or 
all of the service; or 
(4) Services rendered to an individual 
in an emergency department on any one 
day where Medicaid or a Medicaid 
demonstration project under section 
1115 of the Act paid all or part of their 
premiums, co-payments, and/or cost- 
sharing. 
We wanted to adequately reflect what 
an encounter looked like for a hospital 
and apply these concepts consistently 
across the numerous areas of this final 
rule. We used inpatient discharges and 
emergency department services for the 
hospitals because this is consistent with 
how we will make hospital-based 
determinations for EPs and how we 
collect meaningful use information for 
hospitals. We decided that services 
rendered on one day would be an 
encounter. An emergency department 
must be part of the hospital under the 
qualifying CCN. 
For purposes of calculating needy 
individuals patient volume, we have 
allowed the following to be considered 
needy patient encounters: 
(1) Services rendered on any one day 
to an individual where Medicaid or 
CHIP or a Medicaid or CHIP 
demonstration project under section 
1115 of the Act paid for part or all of 
the service; 
(2) Services rendered on any one day 
to an individual where Medicaid or 
CHIP or a Medicaid or CHIP 
demonstration project under section 
1115 of the Act paid all or part of their 
premiums, co-payments, and/or cost- 
sharing; or 
(3) Services rendered to an individual 
on any one day on a sliding scale or that 
were uncompensated. 
We understand that multiple 
providers may submit an encounter for 
the same individual. For example, it 
may be common for a PA or NP to 
provide care to a patient, then a 
physician to also see that patient. It is 
acceptable in circumstances like this to 
include the same encounter for multiple 
providers when it is within the scope of 
practice. 
We considered whether Medicaid 
providers or States should pick from the 
two options provided above. Since 
States are responsible for auditing the 
program and must have reliable sources 
of data, we agree with commenters that 
it must be States that make a 
determination as to whether either 
option will be permitted (or both). 
In the proposed rule, we also 
proposed that if States had an 
alternative approach for the timeframe 
in accounting for the methodology, they 
would be allowed to submit it in the 
SMHP for review and approval. For the 
final rule, we are modifying this option. 
As stakeholders’ understanding of the 
program matures and new technologies 
become available, there may be new 
solutions that we did not consider here, 
but would be a better option for one or 
several States. To that end, in this final 
rule we are providing flexibility to 
consider States’ alternative 
methodologies for measuring not just 
the timeframe that is used in 
establishing patient volume, but all of 
the elements included in the patient 
volume calculation (except the 
thresholds established by statute). 
Therefore, we have revised our final 
regulations to allow States to offer 
alternatives regarding the methodology 
used to establish patient volume, and 
for the Secretary to adopt these options, 
so that they may be used by other States 
as well. An alternative would need a 
verifiable data source. A State also 
would need to provide us with an 
analysis to demonstrate that the 
methodology being proposed by the 
State did not result, in the aggregate, in 
fewer providers becoming eligible than 
under the two options presented in this 
final rule. Finally, if a State is reviewed 
and approved for an alternative

methodology, we will post this 
alternative methodology on the CMS 
internet Web site, and allow other States 
to adopt the methodology as well, 
thereby ensuring that the alternative is 
a methodology that is ‘‘established by 
the Secretary.’’ While we believe that 
States will not submit alternative 
methodologies until after the first year 
of the program, allowing for such 
alternatives will permit the patient 
volume calculation to evolve along with 
State and provider experience of the 
program. 
We believe that these solutions will 
help address issues for providers 
practicing across State lines, who may 
have their Medicaid patient volume 
derived from more than one State. We 
encourage States to build partnerships, 
particularly through data sharing 
agreements. Medicaid providers must 
still annually re-attest to meeting the 
patient volume thresholds. 
After consideration of the comments, 
we are revising § 495.302, § 495.306, 
and § 495.332 regarding patient volume, 
patient encounters and the associated 
revisions to the SMHP requirements. 
Comment: Commenters asked CMS to 
include all individuals receiving 
services through section 1115 
demonstrations as eligible encounters. 
Response: Although the commenter 
did not elaborate, we believe the 
commenter is referring to section 1115 
demonstrations under the authority of 
section 1115(a)(2) of the Act. Our final 
regulations allow two alternate methods 
for States to estimate Medicaid patient 
volume. Under both methods, however, 
the State must review whether a 
Medicaid ‘‘patient encounter’’ occurred. 
Our regulations, at 495.306(e) state that 
a Medicaid encounter will exist where 
Medicaid (or a Medicaid demonstration 
project approved under section 1115) 
paid for part or all of the service; or 
where Medicaid (or a Medicaid 
demonstration project approved under 
section 1115) paid all or part of the 
individual’s premiums, co-payments 
and/or cost-sharing. Because our 
methodology is based upon Medicaid 
payment for an encounter, and because 
we believe it will be difficult or 
impossible for EPs and eligible hospitals 
to distinguish between payment that is 
due to patients receiving medical 
assistance under Title XIX and payment 
that is due to expansion populations 
(who are not receiving Title XIX 
medical assistance), we will allow 
providers to include in the patient 
volume calculation individuals who are 
part of expansion populations under 
section 1115(a)(2) of the Act. The statute 
confers broad authority on the Secretary 
to establish the methodology that is 
used to estimate the patient volume 
percentage. Thus, although individuals 
in section 1115(a)(2) demonstrations are 
not receiving Title XIX medical 
assistance, we use our broad authority 
to allow a methodology that considers 
these individuals in the estimate that is 
used. (Limited to Medicaid patient 
volume determinations, the same 
reasoning would not apply to CHIP 
demonstrations or to State-only 
programs, because no Title XIX funding 
is received for these projects. However, 
in calculating Needy Individual patient 
volume, it is permissible to consider 
Medicaid or CHIP demonstration 
projects approved under section 1115.) 
Our above discussion noting what will 
be considered a patient encounter 
includes encounters which were paid 
for with Title XIX funds under a section 
1115 Medicaid demonstration. 
Comment: Several commenters asked 
that CMS allow CHIP patients to be 
considered in the Medicaid patient 
volume requirements, particularly for 
pediatricians. 
Response: The requirement that the 
methodology for estimating Medicaid 
patient volume is based on Medicaid 
and not CHIP is related to the statutory 
language at section 1903(t)(2)(A)(i)–(ii)). 
Such language requires that the 
Secretary establish a methodology that 
can be used to estimate ‘‘Medicaid’’ 
patient volume for those individuals 
receiving medical assistance under Title 
XIX. However, the statute at 
1903(t)(2)(A)(iii) allows for an EP 
practicing predominantly in an FQHC or 
RHC to consider CHIP patients under 
the needy individual patient volume 
requirements. 
After consideration of these public 
comments, we are making no further 
revisions to this section of the rule. 
Comment: Many commenters urged 
CMS to allow practice- or clinic-level 
patient volume data to apply to 
practitioners as a proxy to establish 
patient volume. This would apply for 
both Medicaid and needy individual 
patient volume calculations. The 
commenters stated that many clinics 
and group practices do not necessarily 
track the pay or data per EP and it 
would be very disruptive to their 
current practice to begin collecting data 
like this. 
Response: We agree with commenters 
and acknowledge that it is not our intent 
to disrupt the practice with new 
additional burdens, but rather to 
leverage efficiencies. We will allow 
clinics and group practices to use the 
practice or clinic Medicaid patient 
volume (or needy individual patient 
volume, insofar as it applies) and apply 
it to all EPs in their practice under three 
conditions: (1) The clinic or group 
practice’s patient volume is appropriate 
as a patient volume methodology 
calculation for the EP (for example, if an 
EP only sees Medicare, commercial, or 
self-pay patients, this is not an 
appropriate calculation); (2) there is an 
auditable data source to support the 
clinic’s patient volume determination; 
and (3) so long as the practice and EPs 
decide to use one methodology in each 
year (in other words, clinics could not 
have some of the EPs using their 
individual patient volume for patients 
seen at the clinic, while others use the 
clinic-level data). The clinic or practice 
must use the entire practice’s patient 
volume and not limit it in any way. EPs 
may attest to patient volume under the 
individual calculation or the group/ 
clinic proxy in any participation year. 
Furthermore, if the EP works in both the 
clinic and outside the clinic (or with 
and outside a group practice), then the 
clinic/practice level determination 
includes only those encounters 
associated with the clinic/practice. 
We have revised our regulations to 
make clear that when patient volume is 
calculated on a group-practice/clinic 
level, the above rules will apply. 
Comment: Similar to the last 
comment, we received comments 
requesting clarification on how the 
patient volume requirements will apply 
in States with seamless eligibility 
determinations and payments for their 
program. For example, some States have 
streamlined their programs so that the 
potential beneficiary is applying for any 
public health care program for which 
they might be eligible (for example, 
Medicaid, CHIP, State-only) in one 
application. Often these States have one 
enrollment card as well. In other words, 
it is likely that both the beneficiary and 
the health care provider might have no 
indication as to whether the beneficiary 
is receiving assistance under Title XIX, 
Title XXI, or State-only funds. This 
becomes a problem when attempting to 
determine if the provider meets the 
patient volume requirements. 
Response: If there is a combined 
program like the one in the example, 
this does not mean that all the 
encounters are being paid for with Title 
XIX funds (or the individual’s premium 
or cost-sharing is funded through Title 
XIX), which is how we explained we 
would determine Medicaid patient 
encounters. We do not believe it would 
be reasonable to allow an encounter that 
is paid for with Title XXI or State-only 
funds to be considered a ‘‘Medicaid 
encounter.’’ Thus, States with combined 
programs (for example, Medicaid/CHIP 
expansion programs), may indeed have 
difficulty determining who is eligible

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
for participation in this incentive 
program. 
Considering these States have made 
enormous strides to reduce the 
confusion and burden associated with 
eligibility and payment for these 
programs, and also to reduce the stigma 
sometimes associated with Medicaid, 
we want to support the work they have 
done. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we believe that the 
best course of action is to work with 
these States on a case-by-case basis 
through providing guidance as they 
develop the SMHP. We believe that each 
State will have different data and 
information available to them. The 
States should make sure that the health 
IT coordinators are working closely with 
the Medicaid (and CHIP, as it pertains 
to this program) policy staff on all 
aspects of the program. The goal will be 
to find a solution that leverages the 
State’s existing and/or future data 
sources, as well as looking for flexible 
alternatives, while still honoring 
Congress’ intent for the patient volume 
requirements, as established in the 
statute. 
Comment: Some commenters pointed 
out that not all Medicaid providers use 
an EHR or submit electronic claims, 
making it tedious to capture a 
numerator and denominator for patient 
volume until the providers have 
adopted an EHR. Additionally, some 
commenters expressed concern about 
how providers would determine the 
denominator for patient volume and 
how States would audit the resulting 
percentage. 
Response: While the commenters may 
be correct about the assertion that not 
all providers use an EHR or submit 
electronic claims, we do not believe it 
will prevent EPs and eligible hospitals 
from participating. These providers are 
businesses and there is an expectation 
that they are tracking their receivables 
from all entities (including Medicaid) 
associated with specific patients. In 
other words, we do not see a connection 
between electronic claims and current 
EHR use and calculation of the patient 
volume. Furthermore, when EHRs are 
used with practice management 
systems, we believe that in most cases, 
this data should be derived from the 
electronic systems. 
When States consider their audit 
strategies, they should leverage existing 
data sources to the extent possible, but 
also consider future data sources. Part of 
the Medicaid Information Technology 
Architecture (MITA) principles 
associated with the SMHP development 
includes consideration of the ‘‘as is’’ 
world, as well as the ‘‘to be’’ world. 
While States may not have the systems 
in place today for a complete picture, 
we expect a longer-term strategy 
leveraging better data systems. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are not making 
any change on the basis of this 
comment. We provided additional 
flexibility in the patient volume 
requirements, which may help 
providers more easily calculate their 
patient volume and provide for 
flexibility when States begin to audit 
providers. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification on how to determine 
eligibility for the five types of Medicaid 
EPs. Commenters also noted that there 
was a potential difference between 
Medicare and Medicaid for the 
definition of ‘‘physician.’’ Finally, other 
commenters were confused if, as a 
specialty practitioner, they qualified as 
one of the EP types. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters that there is a distinction 
between the Medicare and Medicaid 
definitions of physician. The Medicare 
statute at section 1848(o)(5)(C) defines 
an eligible professional as including all 
the professionals listed in section 
1861(r) of the Act (which, generally 
stated, includes podiatrists, 
chiropractors and optometrists), the 
Medicaid statute does not incorporate 
all of 1861(r). Rather, the Medicaid 
statute defines what are physician 
services for purposes of qualifying as 
medical assistance under section 
1905(a)(5)(A) of the Act, and states that 
physician services constitutes services 
furnished by a physician as defined in 
section 1861(r)(1) (which includes only 
doctors of medicine or osteopathy 
legally authorized to practice medicine 
and surgery by their State). In addition, 
section 1905(e) permits States the 
option to consider optometrist services 
as physician services. In this case, the 
State plan must specifically provide that 
the term ‘‘physicians’ services’’ includes 
services of the type which an 
optometrist is legally authorized to 
perform. 
Thus, in keeping with the statute, a 
physician would be limited to doctors of 
medicine or osteopathy legally 
authorized to practice in their State, 
and, in cases where States have 
specifically adopted the option of 
1905(e) in their State plans, 
optometrists. 
In addition, States would need to refer 
to their own scope of practice rules to 
determine whether an individual 
qualifies as providing dental, nurse 
practitioner, physician assistant, or 
certified nurse midwife services. Also, 
States and EPs would need to refer to 
CMS regulations. These regulations, at 
42 CFR 440.60 require that practitioners 
be licensed and that they are within the 
scope of practice defined under State 
law (see also 1905(a)(6)). 42 CFR 
440.100(b), defines a dentist as an 
individual licensed to practice dentistry 
or dental surgery in his or her State. 42 
CFR 440.165 defines a nurse midwife as 
a registered professional nurse who 
meets the following requirements: (1) Is 
currently licensed to practice in the 
State as a registered professional nurse; 
(2) is legally authorized under State law 
or regulations to practice as a nurse- 
midwife, (3) has completed a program of 
study and clinical experience for nurse- 
midwives as specified in the State, 
unless the State does not specify such 
a program. (4) In the case where the 
State has not specified a particular 
program of study and clinical 
experience, the regulation provides 
alternative means for demonstrating this 
training. See also section 1905(a)(17), 
defining certified nurse midwife with 
reference to section 1861(g). 42 CFR 
440.166 contains a definition of what 
qualifies as nurse practitioner services 
and requires a nurse practitioner to be 
a registered professional nurse who 
meets the State’s advanced educational 
and clinical practice requirements, if 
any, beyond the 2 to 4 years of basic 
nursing education required of all 
registered nurse. States will have a 
Medicaid State Plan (and often State 
regulations) that designates how each 
provider is eligible to participate in the 
Medicaid program by practice type. All 
of these practitioners must meet all 
other eligibility requirements (including 
Medicaid patient volume) in order to 
participate. 
Regarding the confusion by some 
specialty providers (for example, 
advanced practice nurses, pediatricians, 
physician sub-specialties, etc.), so long 
as an EP qualifies as a practitioner 
within the State’s scope of practice rules 
for each of the five EP types, they are 
eligible for this program. In other words, 
since pediatricians are physicians, they 
must meet the physician scope of 
practice rules and then they may be 
eligible for an incentive when they meet 
all other requirements. Advanced 
practice nurses who meet their State’s 
criteria for qualifying as a nurse 
practitioner would qualify as nurse 
practitioners. We believe most States 
would recognize APNs as NPs within 
their scope of practice rules. Eligible 
provider types must be specified in a 
State’s SMHP. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are revising the 
definition of these EPs under section

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
495.304 to clarify additional scope of 
practice requirements. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification on how full- or part-time 
status impacts an EP’s eligibility for 
incentives. 
Response: Full or part-time status 
does not affect patient volume 
calculations or whether an EP’s practice 
is predominantly in an FQHC or RHC. 
There is no mention of requisite number 
of hours in the statute or this final rule 
as a pre-condition for eligibility. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are not making 
any revisions to this section of the final 
rule. 
e. Entities Promoting the Adoption of 
Certified EHR Technology 
We define ‘‘promoting the adoption of 
certified EHR technology’’ in § 495.302. 
Under section 1903(t)(6)(A)(i), incentive 
payments must generally be made 
directly to the EP. Section 
1903(t)(6)(A)(ii) of the Act provides an 
exception to permit payment of 
incentive payments to ‘‘entities 
promoting the adoption of certified EHR 
technology,’’ as designated by the State, 
if participation in the payment 
arrangement is voluntary for the EP 
involved. Additionally, the entity must 
not retain more than 5 percent of the 
payment for costs unrelated to certified 
EHR technology (and support services 
including maintenance and training) 
that is for, or is necessary for, the 
operation of the technology. While the 
Act authorizes States to designate these 
entities, the Secretary nevertheless 
retains authority to define what it means 
to be ‘‘promoting the adoption of 
certified EHR technology,’’ as specified 
in section 1903(t)(6)(A)(ii) of the Act. 
Section 1102 of the Act authorizes the 
Secretary to ‘‘make and publish such 
rules and regulations, not inconsistent 
with this Act, as may be necessary to the 
efficient administration of the functions 
with which he or she is charged under 
this Act.’’ Since one of our functions is 
to approve Title XIX plans under 
sections 1902(b) and 1116 of the Act, 
and States would need to submit plans 
as to how they would spend section 
4201 of the HITECH Act funds, we have 
the authority to determine whether a 
State’s plan for allowing EPs to assign 
their Medicaid incentive payments to 
these entities is in compliance with our 
interpretation of the Act. 
We define ‘‘promoting’’ certified EHR 
adoption to mean the enabling and 
oversight of the business, operational 
and legal issues involved in the 
adoption and implementation of EHR 
and/or exchange and use of electronic 
health information between 
participating providers, in a secure 
manner, including maintaining the 
physical and organizational relationship 
integral to the adoption of certified EHR 
technology by EPs. Under 
1903(t)(6)(A)(ii) of the Act and as 
proposed in § 495.332, States must 
establish verification procedures that 
enable Medicaid EPs to voluntarily 
assign payments to entities promoting 
EHR technology. States must guarantee 
that the assignment is voluntary and 
that the entity does not retain more than 
5 percent of those assigned Medicaid 
incentive payments for costs unrelated 
to certified EHR technology. We 
proposed requiring States to publish 
and make available to all Medicaid EPs 
the procedures they developed for 
assigning incentive payments to the 
third party entities before payments can 
be assigned. Such publication must also 
include information about the State’s 
verification mechanism. The State’s 
method must assure compliance with 
the requirement that no more than 5 
percent of the Medicaid EP’s annual 
incentive payment is retained by the 
entity for costs not related to certified 
EHR technology. 
Although section 1903(t)(6)(A)(ii) of 
the Act allows assignment of payment to 
entities promoting the adoption of EHR 
technology, we wish to clarify that such 
assignment would not remove the 
responsibility of the Medicaid EP to 
individually demonstrate meaningful 
use of the EHR technology (as discussed 
in greater detail below). Therefore, 
entities promoting the adoption would 
not receive the assigned payments 
unless the Medicaid EP meets all 
eligibility criteria. Our definition for 
promoting the adoption of certified EHR 
technology is in § 495.302. 
Comment: A commenter 
recommended that CMS require that 
entities designated by States that 
promote the adoption of EHR 
technology must use qualified EHR 
technology and be able to capture, query 
and/or exchange data from beyond a 
practice or closed system in order to 
foster interoperability, and to promote 
competition among EHR vendors with 
vendor-neutral and provider-neutral 
solutions. The commenter 
recommended that entities that promote 
the adoption of certified EHR 
technology be certified to an electronic 
hub that permits the exchange of 
electronic structured data on a provider- 
neutral basis. 
Commenters also requested that the 
Regional Extension Centers funded by 
ONC be permissible as entities 
designated by the State to be eligible to 
receive EPs assigned incentive 
payments. 
Response: States will have the 
discretion to identify entities that 
promote the adoption of certified EHR 
technology in accordance with our 
definition in regulation. We do not agree 
that the definition of ‘‘promotion of the 
adoption of EHR technology’’ requires 
the designated entity itself to utilize 
certified EHR technology. A variety of 
entities might offer services that meet 
the language included in this final rule 
defining promoting EHR adoption. We 
wish to point out that there is also a 
discussion of reassignment of payments 
in Section II.B.1.d. of this rule. 
After consideration of the comments, 
we are adopting the language as written 
with the additional clarification that we 
encourage States to consider how they 
will verify on an ongoing basis that the 
entities that they designate are in fact 
promoting EHR adoption, per the 
requirements. Their responsibility to 
audit this element might be a factor in 
identifying which entities they wish to 
designate, in terms of tangible EHR 
promotion activities. 
We agree that our definition of 
‘‘promoting EHR adoption’’ does not 
preclude the ONC-funded Regional 
Extension Centers from being 
designated by States for this role. 
4. Computation of Amount Payable to 
Qualifying Medicaid EPs and Eligible 
Hospitals 
The statute, at sections 1903(t)(1), 
(t)(4), and (t)(5) of the Act, creates 
different payment formulas for 
Medicaid EPs versus hospitals. The 
payment methodology for Medicaid 
hospitals shares many aspects of the 
methodology used for Medicare 
hospitals. 
a. Payment Methodology for EPs 
(1) General Overview 
Pursuant to section 1903(t)(1)(A) of 
the Act, payment for EPs equals 85 
percent of ‘‘net average allowable costs.’’ 
While the Secretary is directed to 
determine ‘‘average allowable costs’’ 
based upon studies of the average costs 
of both purchasing and using EHR 
technology, the net average allowable 
costs that set payment are capped by 
statute. As discussed in more detail 
further on, generally stated, these caps 
equal $25,000 in the first year, and 
$10,000 for each of 5 subsequent years 
(there is an exception for pediatricians 
with under 30 percent Medicaid patient 
volume, whose caps are two-thirds of 
these amounts). Thus, the maximum 
incentive payment an EP could receive 
from Medicaid equals 85 percent of 
$75,000, or $63,750, over a period of 6 
years. EPs must begin receiving

incentive payments no later than CY 
2016. 
(2) Average Allowable Costs 
Section 1903(t)(4)(C) of the Act gives 
the Secretary the authority to determine 
average allowable costs. Specifically, 
the Secretary is directed to study the 
average costs associated with the 
purchase, initial implementation, and 
upgrade of certified EHR technology, 
including support services, and integral 
related training. The Secretary also is 
directed to study the average costs of 
operating, maintaining, and using 
certified EHR technology. The statute 
permits the Secretary to use studies 
submitted by the States. 
We conducted a literature review of 
recent studies on EHR technology to 
determine the average allowable cost of 
implementing and using such 
technology. We reviewed the results 
from four recent, comprehensive 
studies. 
In conducting a review of the data, we 
determined that the studies demonstrate 
a cross-sectional view of small and large 
practices and community health centers. 
There was adequate data to support a 
depiction of costs across multiple 
provider types. 
To summarize, we determined that 
the average costs of EHRs vary greatly 
because of the size and type of provider 
practices, the differences in available 
features of systems, and the additional 
costs associated with licensing, support, 
training, and maintenance. However, 
based on the information reviewed, we 
determined that the average costs for 
initial EHR systems currently can range 
from $25,000 to $54,000 in the 
implementation year, per professional. 
Since the average costs of EHR 
technology in the first year can be as 
much as $54,000 and no less than 
$25,000, and since we believe the costs 
of such technology will be increasing, 
we set the average allowable cost at 
$54,000. We established this average 
allowable cost at the high end of the 
range since the data we reviewed is 
based on certification criteria that may 
not be appropriate moving forward. 
Specifically, since the ONC is 
establishing new certification criteria for 
EHR technology, we believe the average 
cost of certified EHR technology 
incorporating the new criteria will be 
higher than the current costs of EHR 
technology. It is our assumption that 
making improvements to incorporate 
the new certification standards into 
current EHR technology will be costly. 
Thus, we believe that establishing the 
average allowable cost at $54,000 is 
reasonable. 
Additionally, our analysis determined 
that the range for subsequent incentive 
payment year costs for most providers 
will fall into a large range, based on a 
number of factors. On one end of the 
range, costs related to maintenance 
could be as low as $3,000 to $9,000 per 
provider, where other studies state that 
maintenance will be as high as $18,000 
to $20,610 per provider. Given the 
requirements in the ONC interim final 
rule for the adoption of an initial set of 
standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
for EHRs and the health measures data 
discussed in this final rule that CMS 
and the States will need to collect from 
professionals, we believe that the costs 
for maintaining certified EHR 
technology will also be on the higher 
end of the range at $20,610. 
(3) Net Average Allowable Costs. 
As originally required by section 
1903(t)(3)(E) of the Act, in order to 
determine ‘‘net’’ average allowable costs, 
average allowable costs for each 
provider must be adjusted in order to 
subtract any payment that is made to 
Medicaid EPs and is directly 
attributable to payment for certified 
EHR technology or support services of 
such technology. The only exception to 
this requirement is that payments from 
State or local governments do not 
reduce the average allowable costs. The 
resulting figure is the ‘‘net’’ average 
allowable cost, that is, average allowable 
cost minus payments from other sources 
(other than State or local governments). 
The statute indicates that EPs may 
receive 85 percent of a maximum net 
average allowable cost in the first year 
of $25,000 and a maximum net average 
allowable cost of $10,000 in subsequent 
years. This would mean that, as 
required by the statute, the net average 
allowable costs are capped at these 
amounts. 
Since we set the average allowable 
cost at $54,000 in the first year, EPs 
could receive as much as $29,000 in 
funding from sources (other than from 
State or local governments) as 
contributions to the certified EHR 
technology and the incentive payment 
would still be based on 85 percent of the 
maximum net average allowable cost of 
$25,000 (or $21,250). This is appropriate 
since $54,000 (the average allowable 
cost) minus $29,000 (contributing 
sources of funding from other than State 
or local governments) equals $25,000. 
Since $25,000 is equal to the level of the 
maximum net average allowable cost or 
capped amount discussed above, 
providers could receive 85 percent of 
$25,000 or $21,250 in year one as a 
Medicaid incentive payment. 
The same logic would hold true for 
subsequent years. Specifically, if in the 
following years an eligible professional 
received as much as $10,610 in 
contributing funds from sources other 
than State or local governments, the 
maximum incentive payment of $8,500 
would be unaffected in such subsequent 
years. This result is due to the fact that 
the average allowable costs of $20,610 
for maintaining EHR technology minus 
the $10,610 received would still equal 
$10,000, the maximum net average 
allowable costs permitted under the 
statute. 
In reviewing whether a reduction in 
the net average allowable cost was 
warranted based on other contributions 
to EHR technology, we considered the 
situation of EPs who may have been 
provided with the actual certified EHR 
technology, as well as training, support 
services, and other services that would 
promote the implementation and 
meaningful use of such technology. In 
some cases, we do not believe the 
contribution would reduce average 
allowable costs at all. For example, if an 
FQHC or RHC has provided technology 
to its staff EPs to use, we do not believe 
that such technology provision would 
be considered a ‘‘payment’’ from another 
source that would reduce average 
allowable costs. Moreover, we believe 
the situations in which an EP has been 
provided with the actual technology, 
support service, or training from another 
source are extremely limited in light of 
the statutory prohibitions on 
‘‘kickbacks’’ at Section 1128B(b) of the 
Act. 
Comment: Several commenters are 
concerned that States are required to 
develop a method to determine the 
payment amount for each provider. 
Commenters believed that incentive 
payments should be based on the 
maximum amount and that individual 
calculations are cumbersome and a 
difficult process for both States and 
eligible professionals. 
Response: We would like to clarify 
the requirements in the statute and the 
process by which incentive payments 
will be established. Specifically, the 
Secretary is directed to study the 
average costs associated with the 
purchase, initial implementation, and 
upgrade of certified EHR technology, 
including support services, and integral 
related training. The Secretary is also 
directed to study the average costs of 
operating, maintaining, and using 
certified EHR technology. The statute 
permits the Secretary to use studies 
submitted by the States. CMS conducted 
a literature review of recent studies on 
EHR technology to determine the 
average allowable cost of implementing

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
and using such technology. CMS 
reviewed the results from four recent, 
comprehensive studies and determined 
that these costs are $54,000 per 
professional. We recognize that this cost 
is variable and since the ONC is 
establishing certification criteria for 
EHR technology, we believe this cost is 
reasonable since we expect that current 
EHR technology will need to be 
upgraded in order to meet the new 
certification criteria. 
Next, in accordance with the statute, 
in order to determine the net average 
allowable costs for each provider, 
average allowable costs for each 
provider must be adjusted in order to 
subtract any payment that is made to 
Medicaid eligible professionals and is 
directly attributable to payment for 
certified EHR technology or support 
services of such technology. The only 
exception to this requirement, as 
discussed above, is that payments from 
State, or local governments do not 
reduce the average allowable costs. The 
resulting figure is the net average 
allowable costs. The statute further 
indicates that Medicaid eligible 
professionals can receive up to 85 
percent of a maximum of the net average 
allowable cost. In year one the 
maximum net average allowable cost is 
$25,000 and in subsequent years is 
$10,000. Additionally, the statute 
indicates that Medicaid eligible 
professionals are responsible for the 
remaining 15 percent of the net average 
allowable cost (1903(t)(6)(B)). We 
believe the commenters are concerned 
with the 85 percent of net average 
allowable cost maximum incentive 
payment amount and the responsibility 
of the Medicaid professional for the 
remaining 15 percent of the net average 
allowable cost. 
Since the statute is clear that to get to 
the net average allowable cost, 
payments made to the EP that are 
directly attributable to the payment for 
certified EHR technology or support 
services for such technology for each 
provider have to be subtracted from the 
average allowable cost, this must be an 
individual provider calculation. We do 
not believe we have discretion to change 
this netting process directed by the 
Congress. We have provided an example 
calculation so that in using the average 
allowable cost established by the 
Secretary of $54,000 professionals could 
receive as much as $29,000 in payments 
from outside sources and still receive 85 
percent of the maximum capped net 
average allowable cost of $25,000. We 
have also required that States must have 
a process in place and a methodology 
for verifying that payment incentives are 
not paid at amounts higher than 85 
percent of the net average allowable cost 
and a process in place and a 
methodology for verifying that 
professionals pay 15 percent of the net 
average allowable cost of the certified 
EHR technology. 
States may wish to establish a process 
whereby individuals attest to having 
completed their forms correctly and risk 
the circumstance of audit in the event 
the State has reason to believe 
individuals did not complete the forms 
appropriately. States could develop a 
process for providers to attest to having 
received no other sources of funding 
from other than State and local 
governments as payment that is directly 
attributable to the cost of the 
technology. States could select a 
random sample of providers to audit 
after the incentive payment has been 
paid. Additionally, States could 
determine that certain types of 
providers should be selected for a more 
extensive review since it may be true 
that this particular provider group was 
most likely to have received payment 
for certified EHR technology from 
sources other than State, or local 
governments. This process could 
eliminate some of the burden. 
Comment: Commenters also asked 
that we provide some examples of the 
costs that must be subtracted to get to 
the net average allowable cost and 
therefore the incentive payment 
amount. Commenters do not want to be 
penalized because they did not have a 
fair chance at understanding the rule 
before participating in the program. 
Commenters further argued that 
reducing incentive payments due to 
other non-State/local resources could 
immobilize innovation and temper 
research activities. 
Response: When States begin to think 
through the payments that are not 
considered acceptable and that must be 
subtracted from the average allowable 
cost to get to the net average allowable 
costs and consequently, the incentive 
payment, we believe that States should 
consider the situation in which 
professionals may have been provided 
with the certified EHR technology 
through, for example, an employer/ 
employee relationship. We do not 
believe in this case that there could be 
any payments directly attributable to the 
professional for the certified EHR 
technology; therefore, there are no 
payments that must be subtracted. This 
situation would apply in the case of 
clinics like FQHCs/RHCs or IHS 
facilities. Additionally, States should 
consider that any in-kind contributions 
such as EHR technology or free software 
provided by vendors are not cash 
payments and therefore are also not 
costs that must be subtracted. Further, 
in the case of grants like the HRSA 
Capital Improvement Program grants 
that are used to finance many projects 
within an organization; for example, 
research projects, infrastructure, 
construction or repair and renovation of 
health centers, health care services, etc., 
we do not believe these grants are 
directly attributable as payments for the 
certified technology but rather are 
payments for several projects of the 
organization. Again, we do not believe 
that these costs are directly attributable 
to payment costs for the certified 
technology and therefore must be 
subtracted. These are just some 
examples but the clarifying point is that 
any costs that are subtracted from the 
average allowable cost to get to the net 
average allowable cost have to be cash 
payment that is ‘‘directly attributable to 
the professional for the certified EHR 
technology.’’ Aside from specific costs 
related to computer hardware, software, 
staff training, and/or upgrades of the 
technology, we believe there are limited 
situations that exist in which cash 
payment has been made that is directly 
attributable to the professional solely for 
the purpose of certified EHR technology. 
In any case, we are requiring that 
States submit to CMS for review and 
approval a description of their process 
and methodology for verifying payment 
incentives in State Medicaid HIT plans. 
CMS has the flexibility to approve State 
Medicaid HIT plans that require 
provider attestation initially with 
subsequent auditing of either a random 
sample, or a sample of payment 
incentive recipients most likely to have 
received funding from other sources. 
We also would like to provide 
clarifying information concerning the 
responsibility of the professional for 15 
percent of the net average allowable 
cost. Section 1903(t)(6)(B) of the Act 
dictates that EPs are responsible for 
payment of the remaining 15 percent of 
the net average allowable cost and 
States are responsible for ensuring that 
the Secretary pays no more than 85 
percent of the net average allowable cost 
as incentive payments. In ensuring EPs’ 
responsibility for the remaining 15 
percent, we believe States may consider 
funding that the EP receives from other 
sources as essentially meeting the EPs 
responsibility. For example, as stated 
earlier, States should consider the 
previous examples of employer/ 
employee relationship, certain grants, 
and in-kind contributions. Specifically, 
if a professional is an employee at an 
FQHC/RHC or IHS facility, since the 
employer has provided the technology 
to the employee it is assumed that the 
employer has contributed the 15 percent

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
to the net average allowable cost on 
behalf of the employee. Additionally, in 
the case of in-kind contributions, the 
professional’s 15 percent responsibility 
to the net average allowable cost is of no 
consequence since the entity has 
assumed that responsibility for the 
professional. It should be noted that in 
the case of a vendor supplying the 15 
percent on behalf of the EP because the 
technology, training, support services, 
etc. was either in-kind contributions or 
free, conflict of interest safeguards apply 
and the parties should be mindful of the 
requirement to comply with applicable 
fraud, waste, and abuse laws, rules, and 
regulations. 
In those cases in which the 
professional himself must satisfy the 
responsibility for the 15 percent net 
average allowable costs, we believe in 
determining the calculation, States 
should consider costs related to the 
providers’ efforts to address workflow 
redesign and training to facilitate 
meaningful use of EHRs as contributing 
to the providers’ 15 percent share. 
Considering the costs of training, 
preparing for, and installing or 
upgrading EHR technology, we believe 
the vast majority of EPs will spend, or 
receive funding from other sources in 
the amount of 15 percent of the 
maximum net average allowable cost (or 
$3,750 in the first year and $1,500 in 
subsequent years). We also believe that 
for providers’ first payment for having 
adopted, implemented or upgraded 
certified EHR technology, States should 
take into consideration providers’ 
verifiable contributions up through the 
date of attestation. For example, if a 
provider adopted EHR technology for 
$100 in January 2010 and then paid for 
the upgrade to the newly certified 
version for an additional $100 in 
December of 2010, the sum of both 
investments; that is, $200, should be 
applicable to their 15 percent of the net 
average allowable cost. 
In summary, in response to these 
comments, we are clarifying in the final 
rule that State Medicaid HIT plans must 
explain the process and methodology 
States will put in place to ensure that 
Medicaid eligible professionals comply 
with this responsibility (see section 
495.332). Additionally, we have 
clarified the rules at section 495.310 
that providers are responsible for 15 
percent of the net average allowable 
costs of the certified EHR technology. 
The following chart is useful in 
depicting the effect of this calculation. 
Comment: Several commenters have 
raised questions about the cost of the 
certified EHR technology for hospitals. 
Specifically, commenters believed that 
$54,000 is identified as the initial costs 
for providers with 20 percent per year 
thereafter for ongoing costs; and $5 
million for initial costs for hospitals 
with 20 percent per year thereafter for 
ongoing costs. The commenters believed 
that the $54,000 assumption for 
providers may be accurate; however, the 
$5 million assumption for hospitals 
could be off by a factor of 4 or 5. Other 
commenters believed that even the 
$54,000 assumption seriously 
underestimates the total cost of 
ownership for EHR systems and their 
ongoing expenses and argued that this 
assumption does not account for the 
training and labor costs associated with 
implementation of an EHR system, nor 
does it account for the lost revenues 
resulting from the decreases in 
productivity during the initial 
implementation phase. One commenter 
questioned whether the $54,000 average 
allowable cost for certified EHR 
technology takes into account leasing of 
an ASP (applicable service provider web 
based) model as an allowable cost. 
Response: As explained above, we 
conducted a literature review of recent 
studies on EHR technology and 
determined that these costs are $54,000 
per professional. We are not establishing 
an average allowable cost for hospitals. 
The reference to the costs of EHRs for 
hospitals was only to make the point 
that the costs of EHRs vary greatly 
because of the size and type of provider 
practices, differences in available 
features of systems, and the additional 
costs associated with licensing, support, 
training and maintenance. Additionally, 
there is no reason to establish the 
average allowable costs of EHR 
technology for hospitals since the 
hospital incentive payments are based 
on a formula that is defined in the 
statute and that does not rely on the

average allowable cost. In terms of the 
$54,000 average allowable cost figure, 
we indicated that we believe this is a 
reasonable figure but recognize that 
there are many variables to determining 
the average allowable cost of certified 
EHR technology because of practice 
size, the differences in available features 
of systems, and the additional costs 
associated with licensing, support, 
training and maintenance. The $54,000 
average allowable cost figure does take 
into account web based models since 
the Secretary is tasked to study the 
average costs associated with the 
purchase, initial implementation, and 
upgrade of certified EHR technology, 
including support services, and integral 
related training. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the final rule 
as a result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter requested 
that CMS make clear that any funding 
an FQHC receives because the Medicaid 
eligible professional voluntarily chooses 
to reassign his/her incentive payment or 
any funds the center may have received 
through HRSA Capital Improvement 
Funds cannot be the basis for a State 
reducing its per visit payment to FQHCs 
required under Section 1902(bb). 
Response: We agree with the 
commenter with respect to the incentive 
payments authorized under section 
1903(t); however, we are not addressing 
the HRSA Capital Improvement funds, 
as this funding is outside the scope of 
this rulemaking. Since FQHCs are not 
eligible providers, incentive payments 
will not be made to FQHCs. It is true, 
however, that an eligible professional 
could choose to reassign his/her 
incentive payment to the FQHC. Any 
reassignment of payments must be 
consistent with applicable laws, rules, 
and regulations, including, without 
limitation, those related to fraud, waste, 
and abuse. Incentive payments are 
payments designed to promote the 
adoption and meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology and are not 
payments for medical assistance 
provided in the FQHC. We do not have 
the authority under this program to 
provide that these funds be the basis for 
the State to reduce its per visit payment 
to the FQHC. 
After consideration of this comment, 
we are making no further additions to 
this section of the final rule. 
(4) Payments for Medicaid Eligible 
Professionals 
One important difference we 
proposed between the payments to 
Medicaid EPs and hospitals is that 
States would disburse the payments to 
EPs in alignment with the calendar year, 
whereas hospitals will receive payments 
in alignment with the fiscal year, as 
described in section II.D.4.b. of this final 
rule. There are two primary reasons for 
this. The first is to align Medicaid 
incentive payment disbursements with 
that of the Medicare program, in order 
to support consistency between the two 
programs, as well as among the States. 
We will undertake national outreach 
activities to encourage provider EHR 
adoption and to align the annual 
payment periods. 
As previously discussed in this final 
rule, based on the 85 percent threshold 
applied to the net average allowable 
costs, we proposed that most Medicaid 
EPs may receive up to a maximum 
incentive payment of $21,250 in the first 
payment year. 
In subsequent years of payment, 
Medicaid EPs’ incentive payments will 
be limited to 85 percent of the $10,000 
cap on net average allowable cost, or up 
to a maximum of $8,500 annually for 
most Medicaid EPs. 
Since pediatricians are qualified to 
participate in the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program as physicians, and 
therefore classified as Medicaid EPs, 
they may qualify to receive the full 
incentive (that is, the 85 percent 
threshold applied to the net average 
allowable cost) if the pediatrician is not 
hospital-based and can demonstrate that 
they meet the minimum 30 percent 
Medicaid patient volume requirements 
discussed in this subpart. 
Pediatricians who are not hospital- 
based, and have a minimum of 20 
percent of their patient encounters paid 
by Medicaid are also encouraged to 
participate in the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. The maximum 
payment amount for these pediatricians, 
who meet the 20 percent Medicaid 
patient volume, but fall short of the 30 
percent patient volume, is reduced to 
two-thirds of the net average allowable 
cost, subject to the 85 percent threshold. 
The reduction accounts for the reduced 
patient volume, but the intent is to offer 
an incentive to attract pediatricians to 
participate. This means pediatricians 
with a minimum 20 percent patient 
volume may qualify for up to a 
maximum of $14,167 in the first 
incentive payment year and to up a 
maximum of $5,667 in the 5 subsequent 
incentive payment years, or no more 
than $42,500 over the maximum 6 year 
period.

All State Medicaid EHR incentive 
program calculations, payments, and 
limits under this section are subject to 
our review. 
Comment: Commenters suggested that 
CMS apply the health professional 
shortage area (HPSA) bonus offered 
under Medicare to Medicaid providers. 
Response: There is no statutory 
authority for HPSA bonuses in the 
Medicaid incentive program. However, 
it is worth noting that in comparing the 
maximum participation period for EPs 
in Medicare and Medicaid, EPs can earn 
higher total incentive payments under 
Medicaid, even when compared to the 
Medicare payments with the HPSA 
bonus. 
We are not making any changes to this 
rule as a result of this comment. 
Comment: Commenters requested 
clarification on how the Medicare 
payment adjustments apply to Medicaid 
providers. Commenters suggested that if 
these apply to Medicaid providers, it 
could be a reason not to participate. One 
commenter asked about a provider who 
began in the Medicare incentive 
program and then switched to Medicaid, 
but then stopped meaningfully using the 
certified EHR. 
Response: The Medicaid program 
does not have the payment adjustments 
that apply, beginning in 2015, in the 
Medicare program. However, all 
Medicare providers will have a payment 
reduction in 2015 if they are not 
demonstrating meaningful use, 
regardless of whether they participate in 
the Medicare or Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. Whether an EP, 
hospital or CAH is a meaningful user of 
certified EHR technology will continue 
to be determined on a year-by-year 
basis. A provider who stops 
meaningfully using certified EHR 
cannot receive an incentive payment. 
This is discussed in greater detail in 
II.A. 
We are not making any changes to this 
rule as a result of this comment. 
(5) Basis for Medicaid EHR Incentive 
Program First Payment Year and 
Subsequent Payment Years 
(i) Medicaid EP Who Begins 
Adopting, Implementing or Upgrading 
Certified EHR Technology in the First 
Year 
A Medicaid EP who begins by 
adopting, implementing, or upgrading 
certified EHR technology in the first 
year will be eligible for the incentive 
payments not in excess of the maximum 
amount. Under section 1903(t)(4) of the 
Act he or she is eligible to receive up 
to the maximum first year Medicaid 
incentive payments discussed in the 
previous sections, plus additional 
incentive payments for up to 5 years for 
demonstrating meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. In other 
words, these providers may participate 
in the Medicaid EHR incentive program 
for up to 6 years. 
Table 17 demonstrates the payment 
scenarios available to a Medicaid EP 
who begins in their first year by 
adopting, implementing, or upgrading 
certified EHR technology, and receives 
all six years of payments consecutively. 
As can be seen from the table, the EP 
can begin receiving payments as late as 
2016, and still receive up to the 
maximum payments under the program. 
(ii) Medicaid EP who has Already 
Adopted, Implemented or Upgraded 
Certified EHR Technology and 
Meaningfully Uses EHR Technology 
For a Medicaid EP who has already 
adopted, implemented, or upgraded 
certified EHR technology and can 
meaningfully use this technology in the 
first incentive payment year, we 
proposed that the Medicaid EP be 
permitted to receive the same maximum 
payments, for the same period of time, 
as the Medicaid EP who merely 
adopted, implemented or upgraded 
certified EHR technology in the first 
year. Section 1903(t)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act 
states that for a Medicaid EP or hospital 
who has completed ‘‘adopting, 
implementing, or upgrading’’ certified 
EHR technology ‘‘prior to the first year 
of payment * * * clause (i)(I) shall not 
apply and clause (i)(II) [discussing the 
demonstration of meaningful use] shall 
apply to each year of payment to the 
Medicaid provider under this 
subsection, including the first year of 
payment.’’ We believe this provision 
supports an interpretation that a 
Medicaid EP who has already adopted 
certified EHR technology, would still 
receive a ‘‘first year’’ of payment under 
section 1903(t)(4) of the Act, and like all 
other first years of payment, this 
payment could not exceed $21,250. 
Then, under section 1903(t)(4)(A)(ii) 
and (iii) of the Act, such Medicaid EPs 
could receive an additional 5 years of 
payment for subsequent years of 
payment, with payments not exceeding 
$8,500 in each of these 5 subsequent 
years. This approach allows early 
adopters of certified EHR to begin

meaningfully using technology, without 
being at a competitive disadvantage, and 
without losing incentive payments for 
the previous costs associated with 
adopting, implementing, or upgrading 
certified EHR technology. 
Thus, the maximum incentive 
payments for Medicaid EPs 
demonstrating that they are meaningful 
users in the first payment year, would 
be identical to the maximum payments 
available to those demonstrating 
adoption, implementation, or upgrading 
certified EHR technology in the first 
year, as depicted in Table 18. 
We also requested comment on an 
alternative approach that would limit 
the incentive payment for Medicaid EPs 
who have already adopted, 
implemented, or upgraded certified EHR 
technology to 5 years of payment, at a 
maximum payment of $8,500 per year. 
We refer readers to our proposed rule 
(75 FR 1937) for a discussion of this 
approach. 
Medicaid EPs are not required to 
participate on a consecutive annual 
basis, however, the last year an EP may 
begin receiving payments is 2016, and 
the last year the EP can receive 
payments is 2021. See our discussion on 
consecutive versus non-consecutive 
payments in section II.A. of this final 
rule. We wish to point out to readers 
that this is one area where the Medicare 
and Medicaid incentive payment 
programs differ. That is, Medicare EPs 
do not have the same flexibility afforded 
to Medicaid EPs, who are permitted to 
participate in a non-consecutive annual 
basis, or to skip years, in other words, 
without the omitted years necessarily 
reducing the total number of years for 
which they may receive payment. The 
tables in this section demonstrate how 
a Medicaid EP would maximize the 
aggregate incentive under different 
scenarios, considering that a Medicaid 
EP may initiate participation in 2011 
through 2016. Additionally, these tables 
do not include the alternative Medicaid 
maximum incentive payment for 
pediatricians discussed in the previous 
section, which is two-thirds of the total 
amount listed in Tables 27 through 30. 
Finally, these tables do not represent 
EPs whose incentive payments may be 
reduced because net average allowable 
costs may actually be lower than 
$25,000 in the first year, or $10,000 in 
subsequent years, due to payments from 
other, non-State/local sources. 
Comment: Some commenters rejected 
the alternative scenario (including 5 
years of payment instead of 6), as it 
would effectively result in a penalty for 
early adopters, and reward those who 
delayed adoption. 
Response: We agree that early 
adopters should not be penalized. 
Further, we agree that Medicaid EPs that 
have adopted EHR technology before the 
first year should have an opportunity for 
the same maximum incentive payments 
as EPs that are meaningful users in the 
first year. Accordingly, the alternative 
scenario we presented in Table 30 of the 
proposed rule will not be used for 
incentive payments. 
As we are adopting our proposed 
policy as final, we are not making any 
changes to the regulations as a result of 
this comment. 
b. Payment Methodology for Eligible 
Hospitals 
Statutory parameters placed on 
Medicaid incentive payments to 
hospitals are largely based on the 
methodology applied to Medicare 
incentive payments. The specifications 
described in this section are limits to 
which States must adhere when 
developing aggregate EHR hospital 
incentive amounts for Medicaid-eligible 
hospitals. States will calculate hospitals’ 
aggregate EHR hospital incentive 
amounts on the FFY to align with 
hospitals participating in the Medicare 
EHR incentive program. 
States may pay children’s hospitals 
and acute care hospitals up to 100 
percent of an aggregate EHR hospital 
incentive amount provided over a 
minimum of a 3-year period and a 
maximum of a 6-year period. Section 
1905(t)(5)(D) requires that no payments 
can be made to hospitals after 2016 
unless the provider have been paid a 
payment in the previous year; thus, 
while Medicaid EPs are afforded 
flexibility to receive six years of 
payments on a non-consecutive, annual 
basis, hospitals receiving a Medicaid

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
incentive payment must receive 
payments on a consecutive, annual basis 
after the year 2016. Prior to 2016, 
Medicaid incentive payments to 
hospitals can be made on a non- 
consecutive, annual basis. The 
maximum incentive amounts for these 
providers are statutorily defined by a 
formula at section 1903(t)(5)(B) of the 
Act. The statute requires that Medicaid 
refer, with some adjustments, to the 
calculation for the Medicare hospital 
incentive payment described at sections 
1886(n)(2)(A), 1886(n)(2)(C), and 
1886(n)(2)(D) of the Act, to determine 
the aggregate EHR amount allowable for 
individual hospitals. The aggregate EHR 
hospital incentive amount is calculated 
using an overall EHR amount multiplied 
by the Medicaid share. 
States are responsible for using 
auditable data sources to calculate 
Medicaid aggregate EHR hospital 
incentive amounts, as well as 
determining Medicaid incentive 
payments to those providers. Auditable 
data sources include— 
• Providers’ Medicare cost reports; 
• State-specific Medicaid cost reports; 
• Payment and utilization 
information from the State’s MMIS (or 
other automated claims processing 
systems or information retrieval 
systems); and 
• Hospital financial statements and 
hospital accounting records. 
All State Medicaid EHR incentive 
program calculations, payments, and 
limits under this section are subject to 
our review. 
For purposes of the Medicaid EHR 
hospital incentive program, the overall 
EHR amount is equal to the sum over 4 
years of (I)(a) the base amount (defined 
by statute as $2,000,000); plus (b) the 
discharge related amount defined as 
$200 for the 1,150th through the 
23,000th discharge for the first year (for 
subsequent years, States must assume 
discharges increase by the provider’s 
average annual rate of growth for the 
most recent 3 years for which data are 
available per year): multiplied by (II) the 
transition factor for each year equals 1 
in year 1, 3⁄4 in year 2, 1⁄2 in year 3, and 
1⁄4 in year 4. 
The statute specifies that the payment 
year is determined based on a Federal 
fiscal year. Section 1886(n)(2)(C) of the 
Act provides the Secretary with 
authority to determine the discharge 
related amount on the basis of discharge 
data from a relevant hospital cost 
reporting period, for use in determining 
the incentive payment during a Federal 
fiscal year. Federal fiscal years begin on 
October 1 of each calendar year, and 
end on September 30 of the subsequent 
calendar year. Hospital cost reporting 
periods can begin with any month of a 
calendar year, and end on the last day 
of the 12th subsequent month in the 
next calendar year. For purposes of 
administrative simplicity and 
timeliness, we require that States use 
data on the hospital discharges from the 
hospital fiscal year that ends during the 
Federal fiscal year prior to the fiscal 
year that serves as the first payment 
year. 
The discharge-related amount is $200 
per discharge for discharges 1,150 
through 23,000. To determine the 
discharge-related amount for the 3 
subsequent years that are included in 
determining the overall EHR amount, 
States should assume discharges for an 
individual hospital have increased by 
the average annual growth rate for an 
individual hospital over the most recent 
3 years of available data from an 
auditable data source. Note that if a 
hospital’s average annual rate of growth 
is negative over the 3 year period, it 
should be applied as such. 
The overall hospital EHR amount 
requires that a transition factor be 
applied to each year. This transition 
factor equals 1 for year 1, d for year 2, 
c for year 3, and @ for year 4, as provided 
for in sections 1886(n)(2)(A) and 
1886(n)(2)(E) of the Act, and as 
incorporated through section 
1902(t)(5)(B) of the Act. We note that 
although, for purposes of the Medicare 
incentives, section 1886(n)(2)(E)(ii) of 
the Act requires a transition factor of 0, 
if the first payment year is after 2013, 
we do not believe this rule would apply 
in the context of the Medicaid incentive 
payments. Nothing in section 1903(t) of 
the Act specifically cross references this 
0 transition factor, and, notably, section 
1903(t) of the Act allows Medicaid 
incentive payments to begin as late as 
2016. 
The ‘‘Medicaid Share,’’ against which 
the overall EHR amount is multiplied, is 
essentially the percentage of a hospital’s 
inpatient, non-charity care days that are 
attributable to Medicaid inpatients. 
More specifically, the Medicaid share is 
a fraction expressed as— 
• Estimated Medicaid inpatient-bed- 
days plus estimated Medicaid managed 
care inpatient-bed-days; 
Divided by; 
• Estimated total inpatient-bed days 
multiplied by ((estimated total charges 
minus charity care charges) divided by 
estimated total charges). 
As indicated in the above formula, the 
Medicaid share includes both Medicaid 
inpatient-bed-days and Medicaid 
managed care inpatient-bed-days. This 
is in keeping with section 1903(t)(5)(C) 
of the Act, which provides that in 
computing inpatient-bed-days, the 
Secretary shall take into account 
inpatient-bed-days that are paid for 
individuals enrolled in a Medicaid 
managed care plan under sections 
1903(m) or 1932 of the Act. We 
interpreted these managed care 
individuals to be individuals enrolled in 
an managed care organization (MCO), 
prepaid inpatient health plan (PIHP), or 
prepaid ambulatory health plan (PAHP) 
under 42 CFR part 438. 
Some Medicaid managed care entities 
(that is, MCOs, PIHPs, and PAHPs with 
risk contracts) provide substitute 
services (or, ‘‘in-lieu-of services’’) in 
more cost effective or efficient settings 
than the State plan services in the 
managed care contract. For example, in 
a hospital inpatient setting, these 
services could be in a different unit, 
such as a sub-acute wing or skilled 
nursing wing, so long as States and 
contracting entities are in compliance 
with the actuarial soundness rules in 
§ 438.6(c), provision of substitute 
services is allowed. Although we 
understand that these substitute service 
days may be used to achieve efficiency 
and cost effectiveness, we do not believe 
such substitute service days should 
count as ‘‘inpatient-bed-days’’ in the 
hospital EHR incentive payment 
calculation. The statute requires us to 
calculate the Medicaid share ‘‘in the 
same manner’’ as the Medicare share 
under section 1886(n)(2)(D) of the Act 
and such substitute service days would 
not be considered ‘‘in the same manner.’’ 
Thus, we proposed that for purposes of 
the Medicaid formula, we would count 
only those days that would count as 
inpatient-bed-days for Medicare 
purposes under section 1886(n)(2)(D) of 
the Act. 
In addition, because the formula for 
calculating the Medicaid share requires 
a determination of charity care charges, 
States should use the revised Medicare 
2552–10, Worksheet S–10 or another 
auditable data source to determine the 
charity care portion of the formula. In 
the absence of sufficient charity care 
data to complete the calculation, section 
1886(n)(2)(D) of the Act, requires the 
use of uncompensated care data to 
derive an appropriate estimate of charity 
care, including a downward adjustment 
for bad debts. We interpreted bad debt 
to be consistent with the Medicare 
definition of bad debt as promulgated at 
§ 413.89(b)(1). 
Finally, per section 1886(n)(2)(D) of 
the Act, to the extent there is simply not 
sufficient data that would allow the 
State to estimate the inpatient bed-days 
attributable to Medicaid managed care 
patients, the statute directs that such 
figure is deemed to equal 0. Likewise, if 
there is simply not sufficient data for

the State to estimate the percentage of 
inpatient bed days that are not charity 
care (that is, [estimated total charges— 
charity care charges]/estimated total 
charges), the statute directs that such 
figure is deemed to equal 1. 
Unlike Medicaid EPs, who must 
waive rights to duplicative Medicare 
incentive payments, hospitals may 
receive incentive payments from both 
Medicare and Medicaid, contingent on 
successful demonstration of meaningful 
use and other requirements under both 
programs. 
The last year that a hospital may 
begin receiving Medicaid incentive 
payments is FY 2016. States must make 
payments over a minimum of 3 years 
and a maximum of 6 years. 
Additionally, in any given payment 
year, no annual Medicaid incentive 
payment to a hospital may exceed 50 
percent of the hospital’s aggregate 
incentive payment. Likewise, over a 2- 
year period, no Medicaid payment to a 
hospital may exceed 90 percent of the 
aggregate incentive. 
Table 19 demonstrates several 
scenarios for Medicaid hospitals. 
However, there are other scenarios not 
included here. For example, this table 
assumes that a hospital would 
participate on a consecutive annual 
basis until the incentive is exhausted. 
The purpose of Table 19 is to illustrate 
the general timeline for Medicaid 
hospital incentives. 
Comment: Many commenters 
recommended that CMS instruct States 
to provide hospitals the maximum 
incentive payments possible in their 
first two payment years. Commenters 
provided many examples of how CMS 
should instruct States to make 
payments. For instance, commenters 
suggested that CMS require States to pay 
50 percent of hospitals’ aggregate 
incentive payment in the first year and 
another 40 percent in the second year— 
as a limited source of capital for 
adoption, implementation, and 
upgrades. Many commenters stated that 
it is critical that EHR incentive 
payments be made in a timely manner 
and not delayed or affected by State 
budgetary problems or changes. 
Response: After consideration of the 
public comments received, we are 
finalizing these provisions as originally 
proposed, with one clarification to 
ensure the statutory requirement that 
eligible hospitals, after 2016, may not 
receive an incentive payment, unless a 
payment was received in the prior year. 
The statute is imposing maximums on 
what the State is authorized to pay 
eligible hospitals. At section 
1903(t)(5)(A) the statute requires that a 
State can make no more than 50 percent 
of the hospital’s aggregate incentive 
payment in any one year. Likewise, over 
a 2-year period, the State cannot pay 
more than 90 percent of the aggregate 
incentive. Finally, under 1903(t)(5)(D) 
no more than six years of payment may 
be made, and payment may not be paid

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
for any year beginning after 2016, unless 
the hospital was provided an incentive 
payment for the preceding year. 
However, these are limits on State 
payments, not required minimums. We 
believe that States should work with 
their provider communities to 
determine the best timeframes for 
implementing their EHR programs and 
making payments to providers. 
Comment: Some commenters 
indicated that incentive payments 
should not be included in any 
calculation of total Medicaid payments 
for the purpose of determining Medicaid 
shortfalls, disproportionate share 
payments, upper payment limits, or any 
general Medicaid program service. 
Response: According to the statute, 
Medicaid HIT incentive payments are 
made to encourage the adoption and use 
of certified EHR technology defined by 
the statute, as well as support services 
including maintenance and training that 
is for, or is necessary for the adoption 
and operation of, such technology. 
Payments to providers under this rule 
are not being made for the provision of 
services or the cost of the provision of 
services to Medicaid beneficiaries or the 
uninsured. Therefore, we are clarifying 
that EHR incentive payments made to 
providers in accordance with the statute 
and final regulation are not subject to 
the same limits as payments for items 
and services provided to Medicaid 
beneficiaries and the uninsured 
including Medicaid upper payment 
limits and disproportionate share 
hospital limits. This comment is also 
addressed in the Medicare section at 
II.B.4.b. 
Comment: One commenter noted a 
technical error in the proposed rule at 
495.310 (g) (2) Medicaid Share. The 
commenter questioned whether (2)(iii) 
meant to qualify (2)(ii) or (2)(i), noting 
that the latter would result in dual 
eligibles being removed from Medicaid 
days (the numerator) and would not 
conform to the Act which would require 
that they be removed from the 
denominator. 
Response: We agree that the 
regulation includes a technical error, 
and we read the statute as requiring that 
dually eligible individuals be excluded 
from the denominator. Section 
1903(t)(5)(C) states that the Medicaid 
share should be calculated using a 
numerator that does not include 
individuals ‘‘described in section 
1886(n)(2)(D)(i).’’ Individuals described 
in that section are individuals for whom 
payment may be made under Medicare 
Part A as well as individuals enrolled 
with a Medicare Advantage 
Organization under Part C. Thus, dually 
eligible individuals are excluded from 
the numerator in determining the 
Medicaid share. 
We are therefore revising section 
495.310(g)(2)(iii) to ensure that it refers 
to clause (i), rather than clause (ii), of 
§ 495.310(g)(2). 
Comment: One commenter 
highlighted a technical error in the 
proposed rule at § 495.310(g)(1)(i)(B) 
when he requested clarification for that 
section which reads: ‘‘The discharge 
related amount for a 12-month period 
selected by the State but with the 
Federal fiscal year before the hospital’s 
fiscal year that serves as the payment 
year.’’ He interpreted the language to 
mean that if the payment year begins in 
2011, the Federal fiscal year would be 
2010; and the discharge related amount 
would be for 2009. 
Response: Section 495.310(g)(1)(i)(B) 
is improperly worded in the proposed 
rule and should read, ‘‘The discharge 
related amount for a 12-month period 
selected by the State, but ending in the 
Federal fiscal year before the hospital’s 
fiscal year that serves as the first 
payment year.’’ For example: FY 2011 
begins on October 1, 2010 and ends on 
September 30, 2011. For an eligible 
hospital with a cost reporting period 
running from July 1, 2010 through June 
30, 2011, the State would employ the 
relevant data from the hospital’s cost 
reporting period ending June 30, 2010 in 
order to determine the EHR incentive 
payment amount for the hospital. 
We are revising this language in the 
final rule at section 495.310(g)(1)(i)(B) to 
be clear. 
Comment: Some commenters 
indicated that CMS should specify an 
alternative source of charity care data 
that States may use so that Medicare 
and Medicaid incentive payments can 
be determined appropriately. Others 
commented that while CMS has 
proposed the Medicare cost report, 
Medicaid cost report data, MMIS data, 
hospital financial statements, and 
accounting records to determine 
Medicaid EHR incentives, there is no 
absence of State-level usable data to 
implement this definition. 
Response: We agree that there are a 
number of data sources available at the 
State and hospital levels that would 
allow States to accurately capture 
charity care data for the purposes of 
calculating hospital EHR amounts. 
However, we have no vehicle for 
identifying which of these tools exist in 
individual States or across the country. 
Medicare cost reports, Medicaid cost 
report data, MMIS data, hospital 
financial statements, and accounting 
records are all items that we feel 
confident are accessible to all States and 
providers. Additionally, we believe that 
States and their provider communities 
are better versed at determining the 
tools that will be most beneficial for 
their individual programs. As such, we 
included the standard items listed as 
auditable data sources, but did not 
prohibit the use of other appropriate 
auditable data sources. States must 
describe their auditable data sources in 
their SMHP and submit to CMS for 
review and approval. 
After consideration of this comment, 
we are making no further additions to 
this section of the final rule. 
Comment: One commenter asked 
whether the criteria for determining 
Medicaid eligible days and Medicaid 
managed care days in the Medicaid 
share portion of the hospital incentive 
payment calculation is the same criteria 
for determining Medicare DSH 
payments. 
Response: The criteria for determining 
Medicaid eligible days and Medicaid 
managed care days for Medicare DSH 
and Medicaid managed care days for 
EHR incentive payments are not the 
same. Medicare DSH includes unpaid 
days, while the EHR incentive payment 
calculation requires the inclusion of 
only paid inpatient-bed days. 
After consideration of this comment, 
we are making no further additions to 
this section of the final rule. 
Comment: One commenter asked for 
clarification of the term ‘‘estimated’’ 
Medicaid inpatient bed days. 
Response: We are unclear about the 
commenter’s question. Specifically, the 
statute permits the use of ‘‘estimated’’ 
days in the Medicaid share portion of 
the EHR hospital incentive payment 
calculation. Therefore, we refer the 
reader to the hospital calculation at 
section 1903(t)(5) and section 495.310 of 
this rule. 
After consideration of this comment, 
we are making no further additions to 
this section of the final rule. 
Comment: One commenter requested 
that for purposes of accurately 
calculating and auditing the Medicaid 
Share, CMS should eliminate data 
provisions at 2080.18 of the State 
Medicaid Manual. 
Response: We disagree. The 
provisions at 2080.18 of the State 
Medicaid Manual do not adversely 
impact the calculation or auditing of the 
Medicaid Share. 
We have not made any changes to the 
regulation related to this comment. 
Comment: On commenter requested 
that we include as an auditable data 
sources, data acquired through 
authorized trading partners, such as 
clearing houses, eligibility systems 
maintained by CMS, state Medicaid 
programs, and/or their agents.

Response: We agree that there are a 
number of data sources available that 
would allow States to accurately data 
for the purposes of calculating the 
Medicaid Share. However, we have no 
vehicle for identifying which of these 
tools exist in individual States or across 
the country. Medicare cost reports, 
Medicaid cost report data, MMIS data, 
hospital financial statements, and 
accounting records are all items that we 
feel confident are accessible to all States 
and providers. Additionally, we believe 
that States and their provider 
communities are better versed at 
determining the tools that will be most 
beneficial for their individual programs. 
As such, we included the standard 
items listed as auditable data sources, 
but did not prohibit the use of other 
appropriate auditable data sources. 
After consideration of this comment, 
we are making no further additions to 
this section of the final rule. 
Comment: One commenter asked 
whether the Medicaid payment is based 
on an annually-calculated Medicaid 
Share, or is the Medicaid Share 
established in the base year only and to 
be applied to the duration of payments. 
Response: For purposes of calculating 
the Medicaid hospital incentive, the 
Medicaid Share is established in the 
base year. 
After consideration of this comment, 
we are making no further additions to 
this section of the final rule. 
c. Alternative and Optional Early State 
Implementation to Make Incentive 
Payments for Adopting, Implementing, 
or Upgrading Certified EHR Technology 
Unlike Medicare, Medicaid has no 
statutory implementation date for 
making EHR incentive payments. In our 
proposed rule we discussed the fact that 
some States might be prepared to 
implement their programs and make 
EHR incentive payments to Medicaid 
providers in 2010 for adopting, 
implementing, or upgrading certified 
EHR technology. We proposed to allow 
States to initiate implementation of 
these payments to Medicaid EPs and 
hospitals after the effective date of the 
final rule if they could successfully 
demonstrate to CMS that they are ready 
to make timely and accurate payments 
through the SMHP. States would 
include an additional attestation for 
providers assuring that they are not 
accepting payment in any other State. 
We also proposed that to be approved 
for early implementation, a State would 
be required to have an electronic system 
for provider registration capable of 
collecting the relevant information (this 
information is identified in section 
II.A.5.c of this final rule, where we 
describe the data collection 
requirements). 
Participating States would be 
responsible for transmitting the required 
data to CMS so that CMS could ensure 
that no duplicate payments were made 
to providers. We proposed to use the 
single provider election repository 
described in section II.A.5.c. of this final 
rule to assure no duplicative payments 
were made between States. 
We did not propose that States would 
be able to make early payments to 
meaningful users. Rather, our proposal 
was intended to offer Medicaid 
providers an early opportunity for 
capital so that they would be more 
likely to have the certified EHR 
technology required to demonstrate 
meaningful use in successive periods. 
We stated that since hospitals may 
qualify under both programs, we hoped 
that they would use the early capital to 
qualify as meaningful users under the 
Medicare program in the first year. 
Comment: We received comments 
suggesting that our proposal on early 
State implementation creates 
unreasonable pressure on States, 
particularly given the status and 
timeline of the ONC rule on certification 
criteria. 
Response: We agree with commenters. 
We proposed this option in order for 
States with very mature programs to 
proceed with early incentive payments 
for adoption, implementation, and 
upgrading certified EHR technology. 
However, in considering the complexity 
associated with States establishing an 
electronic registration system (which 
would only be temporary), as well as the 
fact that very few providers (if any) will 
have certified EHR technology early 
enough for this option, we believe that 
this may not be an efficient, cost- 
effective option for many States. 
Consequently, as a result of these 
comments, we are removing this option. 
States will not be permitted to make 
payments until January 2011. 
Additionally, we wish to reiterate that 
States must have a SMHP approved by 
CMS before making any payments to 
EPs and eligible hospitals. 
d. Process for Making and Receiving 
Medicaid Incentive Payments 
The process for making payments 
involves coordination between 
Medicare and State Medicaid agencies 
to avoid duplication of payments, 
prevent fraud and abuse, and create 
program efficiencies to encourage 
adoption. While we have responsibility 
regarding payments to Medicare EPs 
and eligible hospitals, State Medicaid 
agencies (or their contractors) are fully 
responsible for administering and 
disbursing the incentive payments to 
Medicaid eligible providers. 
We proposed to require that EPs make 
a selection between receiving incentive 
payments through either the Medicare 
or Medicaid EHR incentive programs. 
Medicaid EPs who practice in multiple 
States would be required to choose only 
one State from which to receive 
Medicaid incentive payments in each 
payment year. (We note that readers 
should also refer to section section II.A 
of this final rule for additional 
information regarding the EHR reporting 
period and the single provider election 
repository). 
As we noted in the proposed rule, the 
statute anticipates coordination between 
the Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
incentive programs to ensure no 
duplicate payments are made to EPs (see 
1903(t) and 1848(o)(1)(D)(iii). 
Additionally, section 1848(o)(1)(B) of 
the Act requires that Medicare incentive 
payments for eligible professionals 
begin no earlier than 2011. While the 
Medicaid provisions have no statutory 
start date, before States may begin 
implementing the Medicaid EHR 
incentives, CMS, and ONC need to 
provide further direction to States in the 
form of rulemaking and other policy 
guidance. To that end, Medicaid will 
not begin to provide 100 percent FFP for 
incentive payments any earlier than 
January 1, 2011. This also gives CMS, 
ONC, and States an opportunity to 
coordinate between Medicare and 
Medicaid, which will simplify 
administrative complexity in the EHR 
incentive program and facilitate 
provider adoption. 
Under this final rule Medicaid EPs, as 
discussed in section II.D.5 and II.A.5.c, 
will enroll in the program through the 
single provider election repository. 
Once an EP selects the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program, States must have a 
system for reporting and tracking 
necessary information to qualify an EP 
for an incentive payment. In addition, as 
detailed in § 495.316 States are required 
to submit to CMS data on the number, 
type and practice location(s) of 
providers who qualified for an incentive 
payment on the basis of having adopted, 
implemented, or upgraded certified EHR 
technology or who qualified for an 
incentive payment on the basis of 
having meaningfully used such 
technology as well as aggregate de- 
identified data on meaningful use. 
States’ systems and processes must 
receive prior approval, concurrent with 
the requirements described in section 
II.D.8 of this final rule for review and 
approval of the SMHP.

eligible hospitals to report and submit

the required information in order to 
demonstrate they have adopted, 
implemented, or upgraded certified EHR 
technology, as well as meaningful use of 
such EHR technology are discussed in 
section II.A.1.e. of this final rule. As 
discussed in that section, for the first 
payment year based on meaningful use, 
the reporting period for eligible 
hospitals and EPs will be a continuous 
90-day period that both starts and ends 
within the payment year. As long as the 
period spans the 90-day continuous 
period and ends within the payment 
year (fiscal year for hospitals, calendar 
year for EPs), the reporting period can 
begin at any time during such payment 
year. States also are expected to process 
payments on a rolling basis. We will 
issue further guidance regarding the 
timing expectations needed for State 
systems to coordinate with CMS and 
make timely payments 
Comment: Several commenters were 
concerned that Medicaid EPs and 
eligible hospitals that qualify for 
incentive payments in their first year by 
adopting, implementing or upgrading 
certified EHR technology are not 
afforded the same flexibility as 
Medicare EPs and eligible hospitals in 
their second payment year. The 
commenters wrote that they would be 
required to demonstrate meaningful use 
for the full year, rather than 90 days in 
their second payment year, (even 
though it will be their first year 
demonstrating meaningful use). The 
commenters recommended that 
Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals be 
subject to a 90-day reporting period in 
their second payment year when it is 
the first year they are demonstrating 
meaningful use. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenters and as discussed in section 
II.A., we clarify that there is no EHR 
reporting period for adopting, 
implementing, or upgrading certified 
EHR technology for Medicaid provider’s 
first payment year. In order to offer 
parity with Medicare providers who 
must achieve meaningful use in the first 
year over a 90-day period and over 12 
months in subsequent years, the same 
policy will apply to Medicaid providers. 
In other words, Medicaid providers in 
their second participation year (or in 
their first payment year if they are 
qualifying based on meaningful use) 
shall demonstrate meaningful use over a 
90-day reporting period and over 12- 
months for their third and subsequent 
years. 
e. Avoiding Duplicate Payment 
In our proposed rule, we discussed 
the statutory requirement at section 
1903(t)(7) of the Act that the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs coordinate 
payments to avoid duplication, and that 
CMS and the States coordinate 
payments through a data matching 
process, utilizing NPIs to the extent 
practicable. We also discussed section 
1903(t)(2) of the Act, which states that 
Medicaid EPs must waive rights to 
Medicare incentive payments under 
sections 1848(o) and 1853(l) of the Act; 
hospitals, however, may qualify for 
incentives under both programs. We 
also proposed requirements under the 
review and approval of SMHPs in part 
495 subpart D for States to verify that 
providers meet these requirements. 
In section II.A of this final rule, we 
discuss the final requirements we are 
adopting in order to avoid duplicate 
payments in the Medicare and Medicaid 
incentive programs. We also respond to 
comments in that section (see section 
II.A.5.c. of this final rule). As discussed 
in that section of the final rule, to 
ensure against duplicate incentive 
payments, we believe three conditions 
are required: (1) Knowing which EHR 
incentive program a provider has 
selected, (2) uniquely identifying each 
provider participating in each incentive 
program; and (3) ensuring that each 
State has access to the information on 
which EPs or hospitals intend to receive 
incentive payments from another State, 
or from the Medicare program. 
To achieve all three of these 
conditions, we will collect this data in 
a single provider election repository. 
Next, in administering each State 
Medicaid EHR incentive program, States 
will cross-check for potential 
duplicative payments through the data 
available to them through the single 
provider election repository, which is 
based on the NPIs. We believe that this 
coordinates with our requirements that 
a State must have an approved SMHP 
that will include a mechanism for cross- 
checking this information prior to 
payment. 
f. Flexibility for EPs To Alternate 
Between Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
Incentive Programs One Time 
We refer readers to section II.A.5.b of 
this final rule, which discusses rules 
that would allow Medicare and 
Medicaid EPs to make one EHR 
incentive program election change prior 
to the 2015 payment year, and not to 
permit any switching after the 2014 
payment year. Under such a proposal, 
even if an EP initially received incentive 
payments under the Medicare program, 
such an EP could still switch to the 
Medicaid program one time prior to 
2015 (assuming the professional meets 
all eligibility criteria for the Medicaid 
incentives program). Similarly, an EP 
who initially selected the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program could switch to the 
Medicare program one time prior to 
2015. (In other words, the last payment 
year an EP could switch would be the 
2014 payment year.) 
Comments received on these policies 
are addressed in section II.A.5.b. of this 
final rule. 
g. One State Selection 
In the proposed rule, we proposed 
that EPs and hospitals with multi-State 
Medicaid practice locations annually 
pick only one State from which to 
receive incentive payments. In other 
words, a provider would not be able to 
receive incentive payments from more 
than one State in the same year. 
Medicaid EPs and hospitals could 
annually change the State they select 
when they re-attest to program 
requirements. 
We considered the possible impact of 
this proposed approach with respect to 
patient volume calculations on 
Medicaid EPs and hospitals in border 
State areas, stating that because the 
Medicaid incentive payment for EPs 
will remain the same—regardless of 
whether they receive payment from one 
State or from multiple States—we did 
not think the administrative complexity 
associated with dividing and 
administering payments between or 
among more than one State could be 
justified. We recommended, however, 
that States consider border State 
providers when developing their 
policies on patient volume and the 
attestation methodology. We afforded 
additional flexibility in the patient 
volume at proposed § 495.306 to 
account for unique circumstances and 
data collection. 
Comment: Providers inquired whether 
it is permissible for an EP who practices 
in more than one State to aggregate 
patient encounters in order to achieve 
the 30 percent Medicaid patient volume 
criteria. 
Response: First, it is not clear that 
aggregating patient volume across States 
will be an issue once EPs actually begin 
tallying up patient volume. Patient 
volume is calculated as a percentage, 
and not an absolute number. Thus, it 
does not appear that, but for aggregating 
patient volume across multiple States, 
an EP would not be able to qualify for 
incentive payments in any State. For 
example, if an EP has 10 percent patient 
volume in one State (10 of 100 
encounters are Medicaid) and 20 
percent patient volume in a second 
State (20 of 100 encounters are 
Medicaid), this does not add up to 30 
percent patient volume (but, rather, 
results in a 15 percent patient volume

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
as a result of dividing 30 by 200). To 
restate, we do not believe that an EP 
will need to sum patient encounters 
across multiple States in order to reach 
the 30 percent patient volume—as in 
order to reach this patient volume 
threshold, the EP would likely meet the 
30 percent in at least one State. Indeed, 
it appears that the only benefit of 
aggregating patient volume across States 
would be to permit an EP who has more 
than a 30 percent patient volume in one 
State to receive incentive payments 
from another State in which s/he does 
not meet the 30 percent threshold. 
Nevertheless, we recommend that 
States consider the circumstances of 
border State providers when developing 
their policies and attestation 
methodologies. To afford States 
maximum flexibility to develop such 
policies, we will not be prescriptive 
about whether a State may allow a 
Medicaid EP to aggregate his/her 
patients across practice sites, if the State 
has a way to verify the patient volume 
attestation when necessary. States will 
propose their policies and attestation 
methodologies to CMS for approval in 
their State Medicaid HIT plans. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
5. Single Provider Election Repository 
and State Data Collection 
We refer readers to section II.A.5.c of 
this final rule for a discussion of the 
single provider election repository and 
the comments received on this policy. 
As discussed in that section, the 
repository will collect a minimum 
amount of information on all EPs and 
hospitals to prevent duplicative 
payments and coordinate technical 
assistance. 
6. Collection of Information Related to 
the Eligible Professional’s National 
Provider Identifier and the Tax 
Identification Number 
In our proposed rule, we proposed 
that EPs in multiple group practices or 
multiple types of practice locations 
would be required to select one TIN for 
Medicaid EHR payment disbursement. 
In other words, such EPs would not be 
permitted to require a State to divide 
payments among different practices or 
practice locations based upon group 
TINs. We explained that requiring EPs 
to use only one TIN would reduce 
administrative complexity, as it would 
ensure that States are not put in the 
position of dividing payments in any 
way an EP requests (such as by patient 
encounters or amount contributed to 
EHR technology). We also stated that 
requiring reimbursement to be made to 
one TIN would reduce opportunities for 
fraud or abuse, as States would be able 
to cross-check EP and TIN combinations 
more easily to verify EP attestations. 
We also stated that although the State 
would not divide payments among the 
various TINs of an individual EP, 
Medicaid EPs could, themselves, decide 
to divide payment. These EPs could 
independently distribute funds among 
their respective group practices or 
practice locations after the initial 
disbursement from the State to their 
designated TIN. 
Comment: We received comments 
suggesting that EPs should be allowed to 
proportion their payments and give 
multiple TINs. 
Response: For these reasons advanced 
in the proposed rule, we believe that 
permitting an EP to divide the incentive 
payment among multiple TINs would 
introduce an unnecessary level of 
administrative complexity into this 
temporary program. It also could 
increase the opportunities for fraud and 
abuse as it would be more 
administratively cumbersome for States 
to track multiple payments (to ensure 
correct payments) and to track and 
verify multiple eligibility-related EP 
attestations. Once a payment is 
disbursed from the State, nothing 
precludes the EP from further 
disbursing the incentive payment, 
subject to the applicable fraud, waste, 
and abuse laws, regulations, and rules. 
After consideration of the public 
comments received, we are finalizing 
these provisions as proposed. 
7. Activities Required To Receive 
Incentive Payments 
a. General Overview 
As we discussed in our proposed rule, 
to qualify to receive a first year 
Medicaid incentive payment, section 
1903(t)(6)(C)(i) of the Act indicates that 
EPs and eligible hospitals must 
demonstrate that they are ‘‘engaged in 
efforts to adopt, implement, or upgrade 
certified EHR technology.’’ For providers 
who meet this standard in their first 
year of participation in the Medicaid 
incentive program, in subsequent years 
of participation, they must then 
demonstrate ‘‘meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology through a means that is 
approved by the State and acceptable to 
the Secretary,’’ and that may be based 
upon the methods employed under the 
Medicare incentive payments to 
physicians and hospitals, per sections 
1848(o) or 1886(n) of the Act. 
b. Definitions Related to Certified EHR 
Technology and Adopting, 
Implementing or Upgrading Such 
Technology 
(1) Certified EHR Technology 
As noted previously, in order to 
receive a Medicaid incentive payment 
the EHR technology must be ‘‘certified.’’ 
Section 1903(t)(3) of the Act defines 
‘‘certified EHR technology’’ as ‘‘a 
qualified electronic health record (as 
defined in section 3000(13) of the Public 
Health Service Act) that is certified 
pursuant to section 3001(c)(5) of such 
Act as meeting standards adopted under 
section 3004 of such Act that are 
applicable to the type of record involved 
(as determined by the Secretary), such 
as an ambulatory electronic health 
record for office-based physicians or an 
inpatient hospital electronic health 
record for hospitals).’’ In section II.A of 
this final rule, for both Medicare and 
Medicaid, we discussed incorporating 
ONC’s definition of certified EHR 
technology. 
(2) Adopting, Implementing or 
Upgrading 
Unlike the Medicare incentive 
programs, the Medicaid program allows 
eligible providers to receive an 
incentive payment even before they 
have begun to meaningfully use 
certified EHR technology. These 
providers may receive a first year of 
payment if they are engaged in efforts to 
‘‘adopt, implement, or upgrade’’ certified 
EHR technology. In proposed § 495.302, 
we define adopting, implementing or 
upgrading certified EHR technology as 
the process by which providers have 
installed and commenced utilization of 
certified EHR technology capable of 
meeting meaningful use requirements; 
or expanded the available functionality 
and commenced utilization of certified 
EHR technology capable of meeting 
meaningful use requirements at the 
practice site, including staffing, 
maintenance, and training. 
For the purposes of demonstrating 
that providers adopted, implemented, or 
upgraded certified EHR technology, we 
proposed that Medicaid EPs and 
hospitals would have to attest to having 
adopted, (that is, acquired and installed) 
or commenced utilization of (that is, 
implemented) certified EHR technology; 
or expanded (that is, upgraded) the 
available functionality of certified EHR 
technology and commenced utilization 
at their practice site. We proposed that 
States would be responsible for ensuring 
that processes are in place to verify that 
providers have actually adopted, 
implemented or upgraded certified EHR 
technology, patient volume, as well as

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
other requirements in this section, 
including verifying that attestations are 
consistent with methodologies to 
combat fraud and abuse (see proposed 
§ 495.366 through 370, Financial 
Oversight, Program Integrity, and 
Provider Appeals). We proposed that 
the State’s SMHP would detail these 
processes. 
The CMS Medicaid Transformation 
Grants demonstrated the many 
challenges that exist to adopting EHR 
technology. EHR system availability is 
not the same as EHR system utilization. 
It is for that reason that we proposed to 
include staff training and efforts to 
redesign provider workflow under the 
definition of implementing certified 
EHR technology. We explained that 
success is not simply defined by the 
acquisition and installation of new or 
upgraded certified EHR technology, but 
more importantly by providers 
demonstrating progress towards the 
integration of EHRs into their routine 
health care practices to improve patient 
safety, care, and outcomes. 
In establishing criteria for the 
‘‘adoption’’ portion of the ‘‘adopt, 
implement, or upgrade’’ requirement, we 
proposed that there be evidence that a 
provider demonstrated actual 
installation prior to the incentive, rather 
than ‘‘efforts’’ to install. We stated that 
this evidence would serve to 
differentiate between activities that may 
not result in installation (for example, 
researching EHRs or interviewing EHR 
vendors) and actual purchase/ 
acquisition or installation. As Medicaid 
incentive payments are intended to 
stimulate meaningful use of EHR 
technology, we stated our belief that the 
payments need to result in tangible 
adoption, implementation, or upgrading 
of certified EHR technology. We stated 
that States would be responsible for 
verifying this evidence of EHR adoption. 
In establishing criteria for the 
‘‘implementation’’ portion of ‘‘adopt, 
implement or upgrade’’ requirement, we 
proposed that ‘‘implementation’’ mean 
that the provider has installed certified 
EHR technology and has started using 
the certified EHR technology in his or 
her clinical practice. Implementation 
activities would include staff training in 
the certified EHR technology, the data 
entry of their patients’ demographic and 
administrative data into the EHR, or 
establishing data exchange agreements 
and relationships between the 
provider’s certified EHR technology and 
other providers, such as laboratories, 
pharmacies, or HIEs. 
In establishing the criteria for the 
‘‘upgrade’’ portion of ‘‘adopt, implement 
or upgrade’’ requirement, we proposed 
‘‘upgrade’’ to mean the expansion of the 
functionality of the certified EHR 
technology, such as the addition of 
clinical decision support, e-prescribing 
functionality, CPOE or other 
enhancements that facilitate the 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. We proposed that States 
describe in their SMHPs the process that 
would be in place for ensuring that 
providers have actually adopted, 
upgraded or implemented certified EHR 
technology. We encourage States to 
consider the submission of a vendor 
contract from providers to ensure the 
existence of EHR technology. 
Comment: Several commenters 
recommended that CMS clarify if 
‘‘upgrade’’ does or does not apply to an 
already certified EHR. They 
recommended that CMS confirm that an 
upgrade is intended to enable a provider 
to expand existing functionality of an 
EHR so that it meets the new 
certification criteria. 
Response: To clarify this question, an 
example of upgrading that would 
qualify for the EHR incentive payment 
would be upgrading from an existing 
EHR to a newer version that is certified 
per the EHR certification criteria 
promulgated by ONC related to 
meaningful use. Upgrading may also 
mean expanding the functionality of an 
EHR in order to render it certifiable per 
the ONC EHR certification criteria. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the final rule 
as a result of this comment. 
Comment: Commenters wrote that 
given that adopt/implement/upgrade 
(AIU) involves significant practice 
workflow redesign and that the States’ 
overarching goal is to increase the level 
of provider participation, the 
commenters recommended that CMS 
require only AIU for participation Year 
1 and Year 2. They further 
recommended that CMS allow AIU 
compliance to be further defined as the 
provider developing, submitting, and 
following a customized plan for the 
necessary workflow changes with 
timelines (whose development can be 
assisted by the Regional Extension 
Centers); the provider would have to 
meet their timelines for each year in 
Stage 1 to qualify for the incentive 
payment; and the AIU plan timelines 
would have to be structured so 
submission of HIT and clinical quality 
measures would begin in Stage 2. 
Response: The statute at section 
1903(t)(6)(C) permits Medicaid 
providers to receive the EHR incentives 
for adopting, implementing or 
upgrading to certified EHR technology 
in their first participation year. A 
provider’s first participation year may 
be any year between 2011 through 2016. 
In their State Medicaid HIT Plans, States 
will propose to CMS how they will 
audit and oversee Medicaid providers’ 
adoption, implementation or upgrading 
to certified EHR technology. States 
should propose further details to CMS 
about how they will verify that 
providers have met this requirement. 
After consideration of the comments 
received, we do not believe that just the 
development and submission of an 
implementation plan for EHR adoption 
is a significant enough commitment to 
warrant the AIU incentive payment. 
There is nothing binding, nor is there 
any financial contribution towards such 
a plan. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the final rule 
as a result of this comment. 
Comment: Many commenters 
suggested that they believe the goal of 
this incentive is to help defray some of 
the costs of adopting, implementing, 
and upgrading to certified EHR 
technology. As such, the commenters 
believe ‘‘proof’’ of AIU should not 
require completion of AIU but 
demonstrated commitment to AIU. For 
example, a proof of purchase, a 
schedule for training and 
implementation, and periodic reporting 
from practices on progress on the 
schedule could suffice. The commenters 
requested that States have flexibility to 
define what is sufficient to trigger 
payment. 
Response: States should provide 
details to CMS on how they will audit 
and oversee Medicaid providers’ 
adoption, implementation or upgrading 
to certified EHR technology in their 
SMHP. States’ SMHP should include 
further details about how they will 
verify that providers have met this 
requirement. However, while States may 
propose how they will determine what 
AIU activities are sufficient for the EHR 
incentive payment; CMS must approve 
their proposals via the SMHP. The 
definitions included in this final 
regulation by CMS for adopt, implement 
or upgrade do imply completion of at 
least one of the three tasks. A proof of 
purchase or signed contract would 
likely be an acceptable indicator of EHR 
adoption per the States. Implementation 
is on-going, therefore working actively 
with Regional Health IT Extension 
Centers on implementation, completion 
of specific benchmarks or other 
activities towards implementation 
would be acceptable. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the final rule 
as a result of this comment.

the maximum incentive payments for 
their first two payment years as a 
limited source of capital for AIU. 
Response: The Medicaid hospital 
calculation was part of the HITECH 
statute and not defined by CMS. Eligible 
Medicaid hospitals can receive their 
first year’s payment for AIU and not 
meaningful use, but must meet the 
meaningful use requirement in their 
second and subsequent participation 
years. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the final rule 
as a result of this comment. 
Comment: A commenter 
recommended that a Medicaid provider 
be permitted to qualify for their first 
year Medicaid EHR incentive even if 
they have not actually installed certified 
EHR technology but have spent or are 
committed to spend an amount equal to 
at least the lesser of $50,000 or 5 percent 
of the Medicaid EHR incentive amount. 
Response: In consideration of the 
comments, we are clarifying that the 
final definition of adopt, implement or 
upgrade is inclusive of providers’ 
acquisition, such as a purchase, of a 
certified EHR. Providers will be 
responsible for providing 
documentation which substantiates AIU 
as required by the State Medicaid 
Agency. 
We are revising the definition of 
adopt, implement, and upgrade as a 
result of these comments, see section 
495.302. 
c. Other General Terminology 
In our proposed rule, we proposed 
definitions for ‘‘EHR reporting period’’ 
and ‘‘payment period,’’ stating that these 
definitions relate to the requirements for 
Medicaid EPs participating in the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program. As 
discussed previously, the reporting 
period is significant for EPs and eligible 
hospitals because it will define the 
period during which the provider must 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology. The reporting period 
also is significant for States, because 
States will refer to such reporting 
periods in assuring us that providers are 
eligible to participate in the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program. (Requirements 
relating to the components that must be 
included in the SMHP were specified in 
proposed § 495.332). In the proposed 
rule, we specified that States would 
need to refer to the providers’ reports of 
the activities that establish their efforts 
to adopt, implement, or upgrade 
certified EHR technology. Similarly, 
once meaningful use of EHR technology 
is required, States would need to refer 
to providers’ reports on meaningful use, 
including reporting of clinical quality 
measures (see section II.A. of this final 
rule for requirements for clinical quality 
measures), in accordance with the 
appropriate EHR reporting period. 
States could not appropriately make 
incentive payments in the absence of 
such reporting. 
We proposed that States would be 
required to validate to us that the 
Medicaid EPs and hospitals meet all of 
the eligibility criteria to qualify for 
Medicaid incentive payments, including 
the applicable patient volume 
thresholds, hospital-based requirements, 
and all other requirements. States would 
develop their own administration, 
payment and audit processes, and as 
described in § 495.332, we would 
require that States include in their 
SMHPs how they would obtain 
Medicaid EPs’ and hospitals’ 
attestations of eligibility to qualify for 
the Medicaid incentive payments. We 
proposed that permissible means for 
ensuring patient volume and all of the 
requirements described in this section 
would include survey, attestation, or the 
creation of special codes on claims, 
subject to our prior approval. 
Section 1903(t)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act 
also indicates that in the case of an early 
adopter, that is, a Medicaid EP or 
eligible hospital that has already 
adopted certified EHR technology, such 
provider would receive payment in the 
first year and all subsequent years of the 
incentive program by demonstrating 
meaningful use. 
In our proposed rule, we discussed 
our expectation that the bar for 
demonstrating meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology will rise in 
years to come. In this final rule, 
meaningful use and its evolving criteria 
are discussed in section II.A. In order to 
receive Medicaid incentive payments, 
providers will be required to 
demonstrate (and States will be required 
to track and validate) meaningful use, as 
described in section II.A.2. of this final 
rule. In section II.D.8 of this final rule, 
we also discuss our policies regarding 
States’ ability to require additional 
objectives in the demonstration of 
‘‘meaningful use,’’ or otherwise add to 
the Federal definition of meaningful 
use. We also discuss the requirement 
that States receive prior approval of any 
such additions. 
As we discussed in the proposed rule, 
we believe that States should carefully 
consider how to build upon their 
existing EHR activities and 
infrastructure without deterring eligible 
Medicaid providers from participating 
by compelling them to use a particular 
system. We encourage States that were 
awarded Federal HIT/EHR grants, such 
as the Medicaid Transformation Grants, 
to the extent practicable, to connect the 
tools and infrastructure developed 
under their Federal grant funds with 
providers’ efforts to adopt, implement, 
and upgrade certified EHR technology 
and to become meaningful users of 
certified EHR technology. We will be 
evaluating States’ HIT Planning 
Advanced Planning Documents (PAPDs) 
and SMHPs with this objective in mind, 
as described section II.D.8 of this final 
rule. 
As we discussed in the proposed rule, 
States’ system requirements for 
monitoring meaningful use must 
include the capacity to determine the 
appropriate stage of meaningful use and 
the appropriate incentive payment 
amount, depending upon the providers’ 
payment year. In other words, regardless 
of the calendar year, a provider’s first 
year as a participant in the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program is when that 
provider must demonstrate either 
adoption, implementation, upgrading or 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. States’ systems must be able 
to track a provider’s year of entry into 
the Medicaid EHR incentive program to 
determine the correct eligibility criteria 
and generate the appropriate Medicaid 
incentive payments. 
Once States are giving providers the 
Medicaid EHR incentive payments for 
being meaningful users of EHRs, and in 
2012 begin receiving clinical quality 
measures data from those providers, we 
proposed that States would be required 
to share any such reported data with 
CMS in an aggregated, de-identified 
manner, on an annual basis. The 
timetable and format for sharing the 
clinical quality measurement data 
would be provided to States in future 
policy guidance issued by CMS. States’ 
failure to submit these required reports 
to us could result in discontinued 
funding or disallowances. See the 
discussion below regarding the SMHP 
and the State reporting requirements. 
We would use the States’ reports, 
including data on meaningful use and 
clinical quality measures, in order for 
the Secretary to fulfill her 
responsibilities to Congress under 
section 1903(t)(10) of the Act. This 
provision requires that the Secretary 
report to Congress on the improvement 
of health outcomes, clinical quality, or 
efficiency as a result of implementing 
this program. For hospitals eligible for 
both the Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
incentive programs, we proposed that 
we would use the meaningful use 
measures hospitals report to us to make 
quality data on Medicaid eligible 
hospitals available to States.

adopting, implementing, and upgrading, 
and whether this period is similar to the 
90-day period for demonstrating 
meaningful use in the first year. 
Response: As discussed earlier, we are 
clarifying that there is a no reporting 
period for AIU for the providers’ first 
participation year. However, there is a 
90-day reporting period for the first 
participation year in which Medicaid 
providers qualify by demonstrating 
meaningful use. The rationale is that we 
understand that not all AIU activities 
require 90 days, such as EHR 
acquisition. States will determine how 
they plan to implement this 
requirement. 
As a result of this comment and a 
similar comment above, we are revising 
section 495.4 to indicate that there is no 
EHR reporting period for adopting, 
implementing, or upgrading in 
Medicaid providers’ first participation 
year, if they qualify based on AIU, and 
there is a 90-day reporting period for 
both the first year that a Medicaid 
provider demonstrates MU (regardless 
of whether they demonstrated AIU in 
their first participation year or are 
qualifying based on MU in their first 
participation year). 
Comment: Several commenters 
requested that CMS clarify the process 
that will assure Medicaid access to 
Medicare meaningful use data, at a 
minimum for (1) hospitals who receive 
both Medicaid and Medicare payments 
and (2) eligible providers that may 
switch once between the Medicaid and 
Medicare incentive programs. 
Commenters requested that CMS 
provide States with Medicare quality 
reporting/data in a timely fashion (for 
example, within 30 days of receipt of 
such information). Alternatively, 
commenters suggested that the 
providers could be required to report 
separately to both Medicare and 
Medicaid. 
Response: We are finalizing our 
policy as proposed. We believe that it 
would represent an undue burden on 
hospitals eligible for both EHR incentive 
payments to report their data to both 
CMS and the States. We will issue 
further guidance about how States will 
be able to access the meaningful use 
data submitted to CMS by hospitals 
eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid 
EHR incentive payments in order for the 
State to meet its audit and oversight 
requirements. It is not clear to CMS why 
a State would require access from CMS 
to an eligible professional’s meaningful 
use data if they were a Medicare EHR 
Incentive Program participant in the 
prior year. States can only base a 
Medicaid provider’s EHR incentive 
payment, as it pertains to meaningful 
use, on the current participation year’s 
EHR reporting period. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to our regulations as a result 
of this comment. 
Other than the changes explained 
above, we are finalizing the remainder 
of our proposed policies as they were 
proposed. 
d. Quality Measures 
We refer readers to section II.A.3 of 
this final rule-for a discussion of the 
clinical quality measure reporting 
required for demonstrating meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology. As 
discussed previously, we intend to 
update our definition of meaningful use 
biennially, and we expect that our 
updated, Stage 2 definition would 
include additional Medicaid clinical 
quality measures to be reported from 
EHRs. We intend to work with the 
quality measurement community to 
develop these Stage 2 quality measures 
(see section II.B.1.d. of this final rule). 
Comment: Several commenters 
believe that the current clinical 
measures do not reflect key clinical 
services and issues for the Medicaid 
population, including behavioral health, 
dental, long-term care, and care 
coordination (particularly across 
physical and behavioral health care). 
The commenters recommend that 
CMS work with the Medicaid Medical 
Directors and ONC and consider the 
development and inclusion of clinical 
and non-clinical quality measures that 
are more representative of the Medicaid 
population. Alternatively they wrote 
that CMS and ONC should have a 
‘‘placeholder’’ to accommodate data and 
interoperability for these measures. 
Commenters wrote that the areas with 
gaps are behavioral health, dental care, 
long-term care, special needs 
populations and care coordination, 
particularly across physical and 
behavioral health. The commenters 
recommended that new clinical quality 
measures be added as ‘‘placeholders’’ for 
care provided by non-eligible, but 
critical Medicaid providers, such as 
Community Mental Health Centers, 
Home Health, and Renal Dialysis 
Centers. 
Many commenters noted that with 
regard to pediatric clinical quality 
measures, they recommend that first- 
year measures focus on immunizations, 
diabetes, asthma, autism, and lead 
screening. They also recommend 
measures to introduce in 2012 and 
beyond to include smoking, obesity, 
disease- or condition-specific measures, 
and measures aimed at reducing 
disparities. They further recommended 
measures to introduce in 2013 and 
beyond include the development of 
clinical quality measures on 
psychology, child abuse, developmental 
delays, and efficiency measures. 
Response: We agree that these 
measures (listed directly above) have 
clinical relevance for providers. 
However we are aligning with the 
Medicare Stage 1 meaningful use 
provisions regarding publication and 
opportunity for public comment on 
quality measures before they are 
finalized. We are not including 
additional meaningful use objectives 
and measures that were not discussed in 
the proposed rule. 
Comment: Several commenters 
believed that the quality measures 
proposed in the interim rule do not 
match the quality measures that HRSA 
currently requires FQHCs to report. The 
commenters would like to work with 
CMS and HRSA to move forward and 
harmonize the quality measures by 2013 
but requested that until quality 
measures are harmonized across the 
federal government system, FQHCs and 
the EPs who qualify and assign their 
Medicaid incentive payments to the 
FQHC should be allowed to report on 
the current HRSA measures. 
Response: Meaningful use applies to 
each individual EP. Therefore the HRSA 
quality measures, which are facility- 
based, not necessarily NQF-endorsed, or 
reportable from EHRs are not an 
acceptable alternative for EPs who 
practice at an FQHC. Furthermore, as 
explained in section II.A. of this final 
rule, we are not including in the final 
rule quality measures that were not 
included in the proposed rule. To 
ensure uniformity across both programs, 
we have adopted this same policy for 
Medicaid. We believe it is important to 
offer Medicaid providers and 
stakeholders the same opportunity for 
public comment on quality measures. 
We agree with the goal of 
harmonizing quality measure reporting 
across Federal programs and will engage 
with stakeholders and experts to 
address this priority as part of the 
development of the Stage 2 definition of 
meaningful use. 
We are finalizing these provisions as 
proposed and we will continue to work 
to identify, and develop electronic 
specifications for additional clinical 
quality measures that address current 
gaps, such as long-term care, behavioral 
health, pediatrics and oral health for 
Stage 2 of meaningful use. In particular, 
we recognize the lack of endorsed oral 
health clinical quality measures, with 
identified and tested electronic 
specifications. This poses a challenge 
for dentists, who are eligible 
professionals for the Medicaid EHR

incentives, to demonstrate meaningful 
use, other than with the general, 
profession-neutral measures. 
While an eligible professional can 
report ‘‘zero’’ for the denominator of any 
measure for which s/he does not have 
any relevant patients, we will work to 
include in Stage 2 of meaningful use, 
clinical quality measures that would 
provide useful data to CMS and States 
on oral health care as reported by EHRs. 
In addition, in order to minimize 
provider burden, and to maximize 
measure reporting efforts and resources, 
we seek to align the quality measures for 
the Stage 2 definition of meaningful use 
with other quality measures 
development and reporting related to 
health care reform and other CMS 
quality measures programs, as 
appropriate and feasible. Stage 1 of 
meaningful use is limited to objectives 
and measures that are already in 
existence, not those still under 
development. Measures will be 
included that have operational 
relevance to the care provided to 
Medicaid and CHIP beneficiaries by 
eligible professionals and hospitals 
defined in the HITECH Act. 
8. Overview of Conditions for States To 
Receive Federal Financial Participation 
(FFP) for Incentive Payments and 
Implementation Funding 
Section 1903(a)(3)(F) of the Act 
provides that States are eligible for 100 
percent FFP for direct payment 
expenditures to certain Medicaid EPs 
and eligible hospitals to encourage the 
adoption and use of certified EHR 
technology. States are also eligible for 
90 percent FFP for reasonable 
administrative expenses, contingent on 
State compliance with the following 
requirements: (1) Using the funds to 
administer Medicaid incentive 
payments for certified EHR technology, 
including tracking of meaningful use by 
Medicaid EPs and eligible hospitals; (2) 
conducting oversight of the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program, including 
routine tracking of meaningful use 
attestations and reporting mechanisms; 
and (3) pursuing initiatives to encourage 
the adoption of certified EHR 
technology for the promotion of health 
care quality and the exchange of health 
care information. (See 1903(t)(9) of the 
Act.) 
This section of the final rule discusses 
the requirements for States to request 
FFP from CMS for the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. Additionally, this 
section is closely connected to the 
requirements outlined in Financial 
Oversight, Program Integrity and 
Providers Appeals for purposes of 
oversight and accountability. 
In proposed § 495.302, we defined 
terms used in the Medicaid subpart of 
the regulations governing State requests 
for FFP. Although some of these terms 
have been defined in other portions of 
our regulations, for ease of reference, 
and in order to define the terms in this 
specific context, we proposed to 
separately include definitions in part 
495. 
We proposed to include in our 
regulations the requirements that in 
order to qualify to receive FFP for 
administering the incentive program, 
States must develop a SMHP, an HIT 
Planning APD (PAPD), and an HIT 
Implementation APD (IAPD). These 
documents lay out the process used by 
States to implement and oversee the 
EHR incentive program, and will help 
States to construct an HIT roadmap to 
develop the systems necessary to 
support eligible providers in their 
adoption and meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. The 
development of a SMHP (see also 
§ 495.332) provides States with the 
opportunity to analyze and plan for how 
EHR technology, over time, can be used 
to enhance quality and health care 
outcomes, while reducing overall health 
care costs. The uses of EHR technology 
can be integrated with existing State 
resources to achieve these goals. 
We provided guidance in a State 
Medicaid Director’s (SMD) letter on 
September 1, 2009, on this process and 
the State efforts necessary to receive the 
90 percent FFP for planning-related 
expenditures. As stated in that letter, 
and as further required through this 
rulemaking, our review process ensures 
that States are complying with 
requirements of the HITECH Act, and 
that they demonstrate to the 
‘‘satisfaction of the Secretary’’ that they 
are using the funds in the manner 
anticipated by the law. For example, 
because of our oversight 
responsibilities, simply proposing 
activities would not ensure the 90 
percent FFP. As explained in the letter, 
and as further reflected in this 
rulemaking, we must review and prior 
approve all elements of the State’s 
SMHP, and APD documents, and work 
with States to determine the appropriate 
level and type of FFP. 
States are required to submit these 
advance planning documents in order 
for us to approve receipt of the 90 
percent Federal match. Specifically, 
prior approval is required for the HIT 
PAPD (see also § 495.336). The 
deliverable resulting from the HIT PAPD 
is the SMHP. The SMHP must be 
reviewed and approved before it is 
included in an IAPD (see also 
§ 495.338). The IAPD also must be prior 
approved. Until approval is granted 
States cannot draw down funds. 
For purposes of the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program, we believe there are 
two high-level phases in the process of 
planning and implementing the 
incentive program, as well as the 
promoting the adoption of EHR. Phase 
I includes initial planning, including an 
assessment of the State EHR 
environmental landscape, and 
development of the SMHP. As 
explained in our September 1, 2009 
letter, the vehicle for informing us of 
Phase I activities is the HIT PAPD, and 
indeed, over 40 States have already 
submitted their PAPDs and have 
received funding to begin Phase I 
activities. Phase II then involves further 
development and full implementation of 
the SMHP. Consequently, the HIT IAPD 
is the vehicle for reporting of Phase II 
activities. As discussed in the SMD 
letter, and as further reflected in this 
final rule, States need to receive prior 
approval of their planning documents. 
In fact, we have already worked closely 
with the majority of States in 
developing their HIT PAPDs, prior to 
them initiating their EHR planning 
activities, and we expect this close 
coordination to continue between the 
States and CMS. 
Also, as proposed, in this final rule 
we will require States to obtain prior 
written approval of funding, planning 
documents, proposed budgets, project 
schedules, and certain implementation 
activities that a State may wish to 
pursue in support of the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program to encourage the 
adoption and use of certified EHR 
technology in line with the 90 percent 
FFP available to States. To minimize the 
burden on States, we designed the prior 
approval conditions, and the prior 
approval process, to mirror what is 
presently used in support of acquiring 
automated data processing equipment 
and services in conjunction with 
development and operation of State 
MMIS (the State’s automated 
mechanized claims processing and 
information retrieval system approved 
by CMS). 
As proposed, this final rule (at 
495.348) will require State Medicaid 
programs to comply with current 
procurement standards. Specifically, at 
495.348 we have included language that 
accords with the procurement 
requirements in 45 CFR part 95 subpart 
F and incorporates many of the 
procurement standards previously 
contained in 42 CFR part 74. Inclusion 
of these procurement requirements 
maintains the long-standing 
procurement standards and policies for 
State information technology contracts.

Under these standards the State must 
ensure that when procuring HIT 
equipment and/or services, there is 
maximum practical open and free 
competition, and that any procured 
materials or services are obtained in a 
cost-effective manner. The regulations 
also make clear that the State, as the 
grantee, is responsible for meeting its 
contractual responsibilities under any of 
its procurements, and will not have 
recourse to the Federal government to 
settle or satisfy its contractual and 
administrative issues. Further, States 
must have written standards of conduct 
regarding the performance of its 
employees that are engaged in the award 
and administration of the HIT 
equipment/services contracts (including 
conflict of interest rules contained in 
495.348(c)). States must have written 
procurement procedures that accord 
with 495.348(e) and a system for 
administering contracts in accordance 
with 495.348(f). Procurement contracts 
must meet the additional requirements 
contained in 495.348(g) as well as 
describe the conditions under which the 
contract may be terminated for default 
or because of circumstances beyond the 
control of the contractor (see 
495.348(h)). Procurement contracts must 
include provisions allowing State and 
Federal access to the materials and staff 
of the contractor, in accordance with 
495.348(i). 
As was proposed, our final 
regulations at 495.346 also will require 
the State agency to allow the 
Department access to all records and 
systems operated by the State in support 
of the program. Final regulations at 
495.352 impose reporting requirements 
on States to submit to the Department, 
on a quarterly basis, a progress report 
documenting specific implementation 
and oversight activities performed 
during the quarter. Regulations at 
495.354 through 495.360 contain rules 
for charging equipment, non- 
discrimination requirements, 
requirements for cost allocation plans, 
and requirements for ownership rights 
in software. Our rules would require 
termination of FFP in the case of States 
failing to provide access to information 
relating to any of the requirements we 
have included in this subpart. We 
believe the procurement and other rules 
discussed above are authorized under 
section 1902(a)(4) of the Act, as well as 
under section 1903(t)(9) of the Act 
requiring a State to conduct adequate 
oversight of its program, and use its 
funds to administer the incentive 
payments. In addition, any reporting 
and other requirements will assist us in 
submitting the reports that are required 
under section 1903(t)(10) of the Act, 
which requires us to monitor and report 
on the progress of implementation of the 
EHR provisions. 
As proposed, State Medicaid agencies 
will be required to attest, as required by 
section 1903(t)(6)(A)(i) of the Act, that 
States make Medicaid incentive 
payments to a Medicaid EP or eligible 
hospital directly (or to an employer or 
facility to which such Medicaid EP or 
eligible hospital has assigned their 
Medicaid incentive payments) without 
any deduction or rebate. States must 
also attest that payments to an entity 
promoting the adoption of certified EHR 
technology, as designated by the State, 
will only be made if participation in 
such a payment arrangement is 
voluntary for the Medicaid EP involved, 
and if such entity does not retain more 
than 5 percent of such assigned 
Medicaid incentive payments for costs 
not related to such technology. (See 
495.332 of our final rules). States are 
required to attest that the entire 
incentive payment has been forwarded 
to the eligible Medicaid provider, and 
that no Medicaid eligible professional or 
hospital is required to return any 
portion of the incentive payment to the 
State Medicaid agency. States must 
establish a process to ensure that any 
existing fiscal relationships with eligible 
professionals or hospitals to disburse 
the Medicaid incentive payments 
through Medicaid managed care plans 
does not result in payments that exceed 
105 percent of the capitation rate, in 
order to comply with the Medicaid 
managed care incentive payment rules 
at § 438.6(c)(5)(iii) and a methodology 
for verifying such information. 
Additionally, we are requiring that 
termination of funding approved under 
this proposed Part 495 subpart D or 
disallowance of FFP may result if the 
State fails to meet the requirements and 
undertakings of the approved PAPD, 
SMHP, and IAPD, or fails to provide 
access to the required information. 
Since section 4201 of the HITECH Act 
amends section 1903(a)(3) of the Act to 
provide for 90 percent FFP for costs 
associated with certain administrative 
activities performed by a State, we have 
allowed for claiming of such reasonable 
costs incurred on or after February 18, 
2009, prior to publication of the final 
rule. Specifically, a State that can show 
that initial planning stages of moving 
the State in the direction of meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology through 
such activities as training efforts, staff 
support, or contracting with a vendor 
may potentially receive retroactive FFP 
back to the date in which these efforts 
began, with CMS approval, but not 
before February 18, 2009. 
Comment: Several commenters 
expressed concerns about the timing of 
planning and implementation and 
request flexibility in this area. 
Commenters indicated that there will be 
a need for ongoing planning while rules 
and guidelines are being promulgated. 
Commenters indicated that they 
envision a phased approach to 
implementation, and request that CMS 
permit simultaneous expenditure of 
both planning and implementation 
funds. 
Response: We proposed specific 
requirements for States to request FFP 
from CMS for the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program modeled on the 
process States use to request FFP from 
CMS for Medicaid Management 
Information Systems technology 
projects. CMS proposed to utilize 
information and documentation that 
will result from the process described in 
this section to evaluate approaches 
proposed by States, track and monitor 
progress of implementation, and 
perform the statutory program and 
financial oversight required for this new 
program. 
In establishing the requirements we 
believe States will have flexibility to 
request FFP for planning and 
implementation activities to implement 
the provisions of the EHR incentive 
program in a manner that is similar to 
and consistent with current approaches 
to receive enhanced FFP for MMIS 
systems under the Medicaid program. 
This will enable States to modify or 
adapt as changes occur during the 
planning and implementation phases 
envisioned under this proposed rule. 
Further, we believe that the information 
required is consistent with section 
1903(t)(9) of the Act that States must 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that the State is conducting 
adequate oversight. 
We agree with the need for flexibility 
in planning for the Medicaid incentive 
program, and the conduct of 
implementation activities to ensure the 
program is successful in the long-term. 
We have added additional clarifying 
information in the sections regarding 
the HIT PAPD, HIT IAPD, As-needed 
HIT PAPD update and as-needed HIT 
IAPD update, Annual HIT IAPD 
requirements, and SMHP requirements. 
These clarifications are consistent with 
guidance issued in our State Medicaid 
Director’s letter on September 1, 2009, 
which indicated that CMS anticipates a 
phased approach to planning and 
implementation activities. 
Finally, for the final rule we are 
making numerous changes in order to be 
more specific and provide additional 
clarity regarding certain terms and

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
requirements. These revisions are 
reflected here; however, regulations text 
is not updated since the concepts of 
these terms remain the same. 
Clarifications are as follows: 
We have further defined the terms 
‘‘service oriented architecture (SOA)’’, or 
‘‘service component based architecture’’ 
to indicate that they are a means of 
organizing and developing information 
technology capabilities as collaborating 
services that interact with each other 
based on open standards. We are 
defining this term in the context of 
health IT projects authorized under the 
Act to ensure that different systems and 
programming languages provide a basis 
for interoperability among and between 
applications that may reside on different 
platforms through a communication 
protocol to achieve health information 
exchange required under the Act. CMS 
anticipates that States will describe 
proposed HIT projects in the context of 
SOA principles, and intends to evaluate 
plans for health information exchange, 
and interoperable health IT based on 
these commonly used information 
technology principles. 
We have also further defined the term 
‘‘State self-assessment (SS–A),’’ a 
component of MITA, as a process that 
a State will use to review its Medicaid 
information technology strategic goals 
and objectives, measure its current 
baseline business processes and 
capabilities against defined MITA 
business capabilities, and develop 
targeted future capabilities to transform 
the Medicaid enterprise to be consistent 
with the MITA principles of 
interoperability and exchange of health 
information. Although we are including 
a definition of State self assessment in 
this final rule, we are deleting the 
requirement that a State provide the 
MITA SS–A, as we believe the as-is 
assessment supercedes the need for a 
separate MITA SS–A. However, we 
believe it is important to keep a 
definition of SS–A, because there is an 
inter-connection between activities 
accomplished under the Medicaid EHR 
Incentive Program and States’ MMIS 
enhancements. For example, data 
exchanges between various State 
systems that comprise the Medicaid 
enterprise of the State might also 
support the State’s administration of the 
EHR Incentive Program. 
We are further defining MITA, 
because we expect that States will 
describe proposed health IT projects as 
well as their ‘‘as is’’ landscapes using 
MITA concepts and principles. We 
intend to evaluate States’ proposed 
strategies and plans for development of 
Medicaid health information exchange 
and interoperable health IT using these 
MITA principles, as applicable. These 
strategies and plans must be included in 
the State Medicaid Health Information 
Technology Plan (SMHP), a term 
discussed below. We have previously 
published a document entitled ‘‘MITA 
Framework 2.0’’ on the CMS Web site at 
http://www.cms.hhs.gov/
MedicaidInfoTechArch. The MITA 
Framework 2.0 was developed by CMS 
in collaboration with State Medicaid 
agencies and information technology 
vendors to facilitate the adoption of 
information technology principles and 
practices that will lead to increased 
deployment of state-of-the-art 
technologies and improved management 
of the Medicaid program. States 
presently are utilizing MITA and the 
SS–A for Medicaid IT projects approved 
by CMS, and application of these 
principles for activities required under 
this proposed rule will not add 
additional burden to State efforts to 
adopt HIT as envisioned under the 
Section 1903(a)(3)(F) of the Act. 
The MITA principles and tools foster 
integrated business processes and IT 
transformation for all States. It achieves 
this in part by demonstrating that 
planned enhancements to Medicaid 
systems, including MMIS, support State 
and Medicaid strategic goals and how 
intra-state systems other than the MMIS 
have been considered in developing the 
solutions. We believe that as States and 
providers implement EHRs, it will be 
necessary and essential to plan 
technology upgrades that will facilitate 
health information exchange with 
Medicaid providers receiving incentive 
funding. 
We are further clarifying that we are 
defining the Medicaid Management 
Information System (MMIS) as it relates 
to specific requirements for Medicaid 
claims processing and information 
retrieval contained in current 
regulations at 42 CFR part 433, subpart 
C. We proposed a definition of the term 
MMIS because it is the common term 
that CMS, State Medicaid agencies, and 
industry use to refer to the Mechanized 
Claims Processing and Information 
Retrieval Systems specified in section 
1903(a)(3) of the Social Security Act. 
MMIS means the system of software and 
hardware used to process Medicaid 
claims from providers of medical care 
and services for the medical care and 
services furnished to recipients under 
the medical assistance program and to 
retrieve and produce service utilization 
and management information required 
by the Medicaid single State agency and 
Federal Government for program 
administration and audit purposes. The 
objectives of the MMIS include claims 
processing and retrieval of utilization 
and management information necessary 
for program administration and audit 
and must coordinate with other 
mechanized systems and subsystems 
that perform other functions, such as 
eligibility determination. The MMIS is 
also compatible with the claims 
processing and information retrieval 
systems used in the administration of 
the Medicare program. 
We believe that States will utilize 
their MMIS extensively in administering 
the provisions of this proposed rule, 
including but not limited to payment 
and tracking of Medicaid incentive 
payments, access to data and 
information necessary to establish the 
vision for Medicaid health IT, and 
achieving interoperability and health 
information exchange envisioned in the 
Act. 
In the proposed regulation at 
§ 495.332 we proposed a definition of 
the term State Medicaid Health 
Information Technology Plan (SMHP) as 
an integral part of planning and 
implementation of the EHR incentive 
program. The SMHP is a comprehensive 
document that describes the State’s 
current and future health IT activities in 
support of the Medicaid EHR incentive 
program. We further clarify that we 
require that the SMHP will be 
developed by the State Medicaid 
agency, after consulting with other 
stakeholders across the State. The 
SMHP will be reviewed and approved 
by CMS prior to any activities described 
in the SMHP being funded and 
implemented. We anticipate State 
agencies will engage a wide range of 
stakeholders within and outside of State 
and Federal government to develop a 
vision of how the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program will operate in 
concert with the larger health system 
and statewide efforts. The SMHP is 
required to participate in the Medicaid 
incentive program because we believe 
that States must develop a strategic 
vision and plan that includes clear 
targets and measurable outcomes to be 
consistent with the intent of section 
1903(a)(3)(F) of the Act to encourage the 
adoption and meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. 
The SMHP is intended to serve as the 
vision for developing the desired future 
state for the Medicaid IT environment 
that furthers the goals of health 
information exchange and meaningful 
use envisioned under the Act. The 
SMHP should be coordinated and 
integrated with the Statewide plan for 
health IT developed under section 3013 
of the Public Health Service Act, which 
is developed by the designated 
statewide entity. To ensure that the 
SMHP is coordinated and integrated

 44510 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
with the Statewide plan, we will 
develop criteria and processes for the 
evaluation of the SMHP consistent with 
ONC’s review of the Statewide plans. 
The SMHP must contain: (a) A current 
health IT landscape assessment; (b) a 
vision of the State’s HIT future 
landscape, and (c) the specific actions 
necessary to implement the incentive 
payments program, including a health 
IT roadmap to achieve those actions. 
This deliverable will be the ‘‘plan’’ to 
determine how the incentive payments 
will be administered; however, it is not 
the implementation of such plan. The 
SMHP must include all of the elements 
listed in 495.332; however, we realize 
that States may not have all of the 
answers initially. States will not be 
permitted to make incentive payments 
to providers unless they have a 
comprehensive EHR incentive payment 
program established. However, if States 
are not completely clear, for example, 
about their ‘‘to be’’ world at the time of 
the submission of their SMHP, States 
can present the components that are 
finalized and revise the SMHP to further 
discuss their ‘‘to be’’ world at a later 
time. Additionally, as stated previously 
in this final rule, we have revised the 
rule to include a requirement that the 
SMHP must describe the process in 
place and the methodology for verifying 
that eligible professionals meet their 
responsibility for 15 percent of the net 
average allowable cost for certified EHR 
technology and that the SMHP include 
information about how States will 
validate the patient volume consistent 
with the menu of options listed in 
§ 495.306. 
For this final rule, we are also 
explaining our understanding that the 
elements of the SMHP, as listed in 
§ 495.332, may be separated into four 
categories, as follows: 
(1) Assessment and Planning. This 
category of SMHP elements addresses 
requirements in the Act relating to 
increasing the use of health IT, 
including EHR, ensuring 
interoperability, and meaningful use of 
certified EHRs. As proposed, States will 
perform comprehensive assessments of 
the current health IT landscape 
environment in the State, including the 
inventory of existing health IT in the 
State, including ‘‘as is’’ and ‘‘to be’’ 
landscape assessments. Also, as 
proposed, States will develop a 5-year 
strategic plan, and a description of how 
the State Medicaid HIT plan will be 
planned, designed, developed and 
implemented, including how it will be 
implemented, and a description of how 
intrastate systems, including the MMIS, 
and other claims systems, have been 
considered in developing a health IT 
solution. The SMHP will include a 
description of data-sharing components 
of proposed health IT solutions, 
including security provisions, and 
description of how the State will 
support integration of clinical and 
administrative data. 
(2) Ensuring improvements in health 
outcomes, clinical quality, and 
efficiency. This category of SMHP 
elements will address requirements in 
the Act relating to improving healthcare 
quality and lowering costs. As 
proposed, States will include 
components that describe a process for 
ensuring improvements in health 
outcomes, clinical quality, or efficiency 
resulting from the adoption of certified 
EHR technology by recipients of 
Medicaid EHR incentive payments and 
a methodology for verifying such 
information. As proposed, we are 
requiring a description of how the State 
will address, in the long-term, the needs 
of underserved and vulnerable 
populations such as children, 
individuals with chronic conditions, 
Title IV–E foster care children, 
individuals in long-term care settings 
and the aged, blind, and disabled. We 
proposed that in order to obtain 
approval for their SMHP and 
implementation funding, a State would 
have to detail how their EHR Incentive 
Program addressed the concepts of self- 
direction including budget development 
and expenditure tracking for persons 
with disabilities. After additional 
consideration, CMS decided that these 
concepts are not directly applicable to 
electronic health records or meaningful 
use, per se, and while important, are 
more associated with other e-Health 
tools, such as personal health records. 
Furthermore, the provider types to 
whom this is most directly relevant, 
such as home, institutional and 
community-based providers and 
facilities, are not eligible for EHR 
incentives so including planning for this 
issue was not perceived as rising to the 
level of a requirement. It is anticipated 
that Stage 2 of meaningful use will 
include greater levels of patient 
engagement, including via personal 
health records. However, we think it is 
premature to require that States fully 
address this issue in their SMHPs order 
to initiate their EHR Incentive Programs 
for Stage 1. 
As proposed, we will also require a 
description of the process in place for 
ensuring that any certified EHR 
technology used as the basis for 
incentive payments to Medicaid 
providers is compatible with State or 
Federal administrative management 
systems, including the MMIS, or other 
automated claims processing system or 
information retrieval system, and a 
methodology for verifying such 
information. 
(3) Interoperability and Health 
Information Exchange. This category of 
SMHP elements will address 
requirements in the Act relating to 
ensuring interoperability and increasing 
health information exchange. We 
proposed a series of elements that 
explain how the State will adopt 
national data standards for health and 
data exchange and open standards for 
technical solutions as they become 
available. These elements of the SMHP 
also are included in our final rule. 
(4) Administration and Oversight. 
This category of SMHP elements 
address the requirements in the Act 
relating to implementation and financial 
oversight of the program. For provider 
eligibility, we proposed that States 
provide a description of the process 
they will use for ensuring that each EP 
and eligible hospital meets provider 
enrollment eligibility criteria upon 
enrollment and re-enrollment to the 
Medicaid EHR payment incentive 
program, and the process for ensuring 
patient volume consistent with the 
criteria in § 495.304 and § 495.306, and 
for ensuring that each Medicaid EP is 
not hospital-based and that there is a 
methodology in place used to verify 
such information. We are finalizing 
most of these requirements, as 
proposed. However, in response to 
comments suggesting that CMS define 
the term ‘‘encounter’’ and take a menu 
approach to patient volume to allow 
States several options, based on their 
data sources, CMS has included changes 
to the SMHP requirements for the 
patient volume requirement in 
§ 495.302, § 495.306, and § 495.332. 
These changes are discussed under the 
patient volume section of this final rule. 
We note that States that wish to offer an 
alternative for estimating patient 
volume would be required to involve 
key stakeholders in the determination of 
such alternative. We also proposed, and 
are finalizing, specific elements in the 
SMHP relating to monitoring and 
validation of information, including a 
method of ensuring all information from 
provider attestations is captured, stored, 
and verified, and any information added 
to the CMS Single Provider Repository 
is all true and accurate. We also 
proposed, and are finalizing, that States 
include a list of the specific actions 
planned to implement the EHR 
incentive program, including a 
description and organizational charts for 
workgroups within State government 
and external partners. As proposed, 
States will need to describe the process 
they have in place to ensure that no

amounts higher than 100 percent of FFP 
will be claimed for reimbursement of 
expenditures for State payments to 
Medicaid eligible providers for the 
certified EHR incentive payment 
program, and a methodology for 
verifying such information is available 
and the process to ensure that no 
amounts higher than 90 percent of FFP 
will be claimed for CMS-approved 
administrative expenses in 
administering the certified EHR 
technology incentive payment program, 
including a methodology for verifying 
such information. As proposed, States 
will need to include mechanisms for 
making timely and accurate payments 
and a requirement that providers attest 
that they are not receiving a payment in 
any other State under the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program. This category also 
includes elements relating to financial 
management and auditing necessary to 
ensure the proper and efficient 
management and oversight of the 
program and FFP. 
Finally, we proposed that the States 
may propose in the SMHP alternatives 
to measuring patient volume or 
achieving meaningful use. The rules for 
proposing alternatives are discussed 
elsewhere in this final rule. 
We are further clarifying the 
definition of Health Information 
Technology Planning Advance Planning 
Document (HIT PAPD) (and any 
necessary update documents) to mean a 
plan of action that requests FFP and 
approval to initiate and accomplish 
planning activities necessary for a State 
agency to determine the need for and 
plan the acquisition of HIT equipment 
and services, and to acquire information 
necessary to prepare a HIT 
Implementation Advanced Planning 
Document (HIT IAPD), described below, 
or common procurement instruments, 
such as requests for proposals, or 
requests for qualifications and 
quotations, necessary to implement the 
SMHP. CMS is including a definition of 
the HIT PAPD so that States may submit 
proposed resources and planning 
activities, which are described in further 
detail in our State Medicaid Director’s 
letter on September 1, 2009, to receive 
the 90 percent FFP match for initial 
planning activities related to the 
Medicaid EHR incentive payment 
program. In order to qualify for the 90 
percent FFP administrative match, 
section 1903(t)(9) of the Act requires a 
State to demonstrate, to the satisfaction 
of the Secretary, compliance with three 
specific criteria: 
(A) The State uses the funds for 
purposes of administering the incentive 
payments, including the tracking of 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology by Medicaid providers; 
(B) The State conducts adequate 
oversight of the incentive program, 
including routine tracking of 
meaningful use attestations and 
reporting mechanisms; and 
(C) The State pursues initiatives to 
encourage adoption of certified EHR 
technology to promote health care 
quality and the exchange of health care 
information under Medicaid, subject to 
applicable laws and regulations 
governing such exchange, while 
ensuring privacy and security of data 
provided to its data exchange partners. 
We are further clarifying the 
definition of Health Information 
Technology Implementation Advance 
Planning Document (HIT IAPD) (and 
any necessary update documents) to 
mean a plan of action that requests 
approval of FFP to acquire necessary 
resources to implement and administer 
the activities and objectives of the 
State’s proposed SMHP, once the SMHP 
is approved by CMS, including the 
allocation or acquisition of human 
resources, services and equipment. To 
qualify to receive FFP for administering 
the incentive program, States must 
develop an HIT PAPD, SMHP, and an 
HIT IAPD. These documents would lay 
out the process States will use to 
implement and oversee the EHR 
incentive program, and would help 
States to construct and maintain a 
health IT roadmap to develop the 
systems necessary to support providers 
in their adoption and meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. 
With respect to FFP under the 
Medicaid incentive program, we are 
clarifying that the incentive payments to 
providers are matched at 100 percent 
FFP as described above, and therefore 
there is no non-Federal share for these 
payments. However, there is a non- 
Federal share necessary for the 
administration of the payment 
incentives. That is, CMS is reimbursing 
States at 90 percent FFP for reasonable 
expenses related to the administration 
of the payment incentives. States must 
fund the 10 percent non-Federal share 
of Medicaid health information 
technology (health IT) administrative 
payments consistent with existing rules 
and regulations regarding funding of the 
non-Federal share. We review non- 
Federal share funding sources to ensure 
compliance with existing statute and 
regulations. Consistent with current 
practice, we will review non-Federal 
share funding sources on an individual 
basis using information provided by the 
State and gathered by CMS staff. 
Existing rules permit States to provide 
the non-Federal share of administrative 
claims through various sources, 
including appropriations, 
intergovernmental transfers, certified 
public expenditures, bona fide 
donations, and permissible health care 
related taxes. CMS’ regional financial 
management staff will review funding 
sources and will review the Medicaid 
Budget and Expenditure System to 
ensure that all claims for reimbursement 
are appropriate. Additionally, States are 
required to submit SMHPs outlining 
their process for making payments and 
ensuring that all claims for 
reimbursement are appropriate to CMS 
for review and approval. 
At § 495.324 we proposed to review 
and prior approve all elements of the 
State’s APD documents and SMHP 
described in this rule to ensure that all 
of the intended objectives of the 
program are addressed. We are 
finalizing this proposal. States are 
required to submit these APD 
documents and the SMHP in order for 
us to approve FFP. Specifically, prior 
approval is required for the HIT PAPD 
(see also § 495.336). The deliverable 
resulting from the HIT PAPD is the 
SMHP. The SMHP will be reviewed and 
approved before it is included in an HIT 
Implementation APD (HIT IAPD) (see 
also § 495.338). The HIT IAPD also must 
be prior approved. After a HIT PAPD is 
approved for planning activities, and 
these planning activities are complete, 
we anticipate that in certain cases, 
States may decide to submit the SMHP 
and HIT IAPD together in one 
submission for CMS review and 
approval. In all cases, until approval is 
granted, States cannot draw down 
Federal funds. We envision that the 
prior approval process described at 
§ 495.324 will permit States to work 
closely with CMS in developing the HIT 
PAPD prior to initiating EHR planning 
activities and prior to submission of the 
initial HIT PAPD. 
We are defining ‘‘as needed’’ and 
‘‘annual’’ updates to the HIT PAPD and 
HIT IAPD at § 495.340 and § 495.342. In 
consultation with States and other key 
stakeholders, CMS has determined that 
planning and implementing the 
Medicaid EHR incentive payment 
program will be a complex process that 
will result in a need for ‘‘as needed’’ and 
‘‘annual’’ updates to the original scope of 
work. Therefore, we proposed that the 
APD process would allow States to 
update their APD documents when they 
anticipate changes in the amount of 
FFP, duration of the project, or scope of 
work or activities under the APD. We 
are finalizing this proposal, as it allows 
States flexibility to add additional tasks 
and milestones as the project evolves, as 
determined since the date the APD was

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
initially approved or since the most 
recently updated and approved APD. 
We initially proposed that we 
envision two phases in the process of 
planning and implementing the 
incentive program, as well as the 
promotion of adoption and meaningful 
use of EHR. We are further clarifying 
that based on submission of HIT PAPDs 
in response to guidance provided in our 
State Medicaid Director’s letter of 
September 1, 2009, initial planning 
timelines are ranging from 6 months to 
18 months to develop the SMHP. CMS 
envisions that States will begin to 
administer the EHR incentive program 
on January 1, 2011, once the SMHP and 
IAPD are approved. As proposed, we 
will issue additional written guidance, 
similar to our earlier SMD letter, 
concerning timelines for 
implementation of the EHR incentive 
program as States develop the SMHP. 
We require the HIT IAPD as the 
vehicle for informing us of Phase II 
activities. We anticipate that States will 
also have ongoing planning needs as 
implementation activities, once 
approved under the IAPD, are under 
way. We further envision that the IAPD 
‘‘annual’’ or ‘‘as needed’’ updates may 
also include requests for approval of 
FFP for other Phase II that are necessary 
to continue planning and development 
for the ongoing implementation phases 
of the program. In section 495.388, we 
proposed to require that States submit 
information in the IAPD regarding an 
estimate of prospective cost allocation 
(OMB Circular A–87, Cost Principles for 
State, Local, and Indian Tribal 
Governments) to the various State and 
Federal funding sources and the 
proposed procedures for distributing 
costs including a detailed payment list 
file to include NPI, name, and type of 
provider for which the State will 
provide incentive payments. For the 
final rule, we are continuing to require 
the estimate of prospective cost 
distribution and the procedures for 
distributing costs; however, we are 
eliminating the requirement that States 
have to submit NPI, name and provider 
type as part of the estimates for cost 
distribution since we realize that in 
continuing to require this information 
States will not be able to submit 
approvable IAPDs to CMS because 
States will not have this information at 
the time of submittal; hence, States will 
not be successful in implementing this 
program. 
We wish to further clarify that in 
proposing termination of funding if the 
State fails to meet the requirements and 
undertakings of the approved HIT 
PAPD, SMHP, and HIT IAPD, or fails to 
provide access to the required 
information, this requirement is 
necessary to ensure the proper and 
efficient use of FFP and is consistent 
with present authority under the Act 
and existing regulations that are 
promulgated by CMS, including at 45 
CFR Part 95, Subpart F. 
Comment: One commenter questioned 
whether the EHR incentive payments 
will be required to be processed through 
the Medicaid Management Information 
System (MMIS). 
Response: Payments under the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program are 
authorized under Title XIX of the Social 
Security Act as part of the Medicaid 
program. We require that States have an 
automated claims processing and 
information and retrieval system, 
known as MMIS to manage health care 
provider payments for health care 
services, and provide information for 
program management, administration, 
and auditing. As such, we believe that 
most States will choose to process, 
monitor, and report Medicaid incentive 
payments to eligible professionals and 
hospitals participating in the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program using the MMIS. 
States may propose alternative methods 
to process, monitor, and report 
Medicaid incentive payments in their 
SMHP. Any proposed method to 
process, monitor, and report Medicaid 
incentive payments, including 
utilization of the State’s MMIS, must be 
approved by CMS. Through guidance 
issued in a State Medicaid Directors 
Letter and via case by case analysis of 
APDs, CMS will collaborate with States 
to approve system development and 
enhancement expenditures under the 
most appropriate funding source, 
HITECH or MMIS. 
Comment: One commenter provided 
comments on § 495.348(d), Procurement 
standards; Competition, and 
§ 495.360(a). The commenter agrees that 
procurement transactions are conducted 
to provide, to the maximum extent 
practicable, open and free competition 
and recommends that procurement 
transactions require that bidders bid 
specifically for the EHR portion of any 
project (to ensure that the discrete costs 
are clearly identified), (2) no certified 
EHR technology may be excluded from 
bidding, and (3) all projects must be 
both EHR-neutral and provider-neutral. 
They further comment that CMS could 
consider having either a cap or 
percentage limits on the amount of 
administrative costs or consulting fees 
to ensure that the bulk of the award is 
used for the hard costs of the project: 
equipment, connectivity, and training. 
Response: The requirement in 
§ 495.348(d) is limited to States and 
other grantees of Federal funds 
authorized under Title XIX of the Social 
Security Act and does not apply to 
procurement standards for vendors 
bidding on EHR technology for eligible 
providers. However, CMS will 
encourage States to include adoption of 
interoperable solutions that align with 
the MITA principles that address IT 
architectural and platform neutrality. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter 
recommended that CMS reconsider the 
general rule set forth in § 495.360 that 
‘‘the State or local government must 
include a clause in all procurement 
instruments that provides that the State 
or local government will have all 
ownership rights in software or 
modifications thereof and associated 
documentation designed, developed or 
installed with FFP under this Subpart.’’ 
The commenter states that it is typical 
for the vendor to own the underlying 
software, and State or local governments 
are provided a license to use the 
software, and this is contrary to the 
proposed general rule. 
Response: We disagree with the 
recommendation to exclude a clause in 
all State procurement instruments that 
provides that the State or local 
government will have all ownership 
rights in software developed or 
modified using Federal funding. This is 
a long-standing principal for use of FFP 
associated with the development of 
information technology solutions that 
may be licensed for use by other State 
or Federal government agencies to 
benefit the Medicaid program, at no 
additional cost for the license. CMS 
clarifies that costs of the license 
agreements for proprietary software may 
be reimbursable under the provisions of 
1903(a)(3)(F)(ii) of the Act that provides 
for 90 percent FFP for costs associated 
with certain administrative activities 
performed by a State. However, costs 
associated with developing or 
modifying software may not be funded 
with Federal funds unless the State has 
ownership rights to that software. This 
provision does not apply to eligible 
providers or hospitals purchasing 
software for which Federal funding has 
been provided by States through the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program. 
Proposed costs may be submitted for 
review and consideration for approval 
by CMS as part of the HIT PAPD and 
HIT IAPD requirements described in 
this proposed rule under § 495.336 and 
§ 495.338. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment.

 44513 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Comment: One commenter indicated 
that the process for State Medicaid 
plans seems to be lengthy, with no 
timeframes specified for initial 
submission from the State to the 
Department, nor is there a timeline for 
the approval process from CMS back to 
the State. There is also no timeline for 
the implementation of the health IT 
programs after a State receives approval. 
The commenter also notes that with the 
burden for administration on the States, 
there may not be adequate time to get 
all of the activities completed to have 
infrastructure and processes in place to 
accept data or attestations from the 
Eligible Providers and Eligible 
Hospitals. 
Response: We provided specific 
guidance on timelines and process prior 
to the initial planning period regarding 
State planning activities and 
administrative expenses for provider 
incentive payments in our State 
Medicaid Director’s letter on September 
1, 2009. We also indicated in our letter 
that CMS will work with States to 
determine when each State is ready to 
begin making payments. We have 
provided additional rationale about the 
process for submitting documents and 
required content in the final rule. In the 
near future, CMS will issue more 
guidance on specific implementation 
activities and timelines, prior to States 
submission of their SMHP and IAPD. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter requested 
that CMS require that States pass 
through the matching funds to 
providers. 
Response: The regulation at section 
495.366 requires that States have a 
process in place to assure that Medicaid 
EHR incentive payments are made 
without reduction or rebate, have been 
paid directly to an eligible provider or 
to an employer, a facility, or an eligible 
third party entity to which the Medicaid 
eligible provider has assigned payments. 
This language is consistent with the 
statutory language at 1903(t)(6). We will 
require that this process be established 
in the SMHP. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter requested 
that CMS clarify that use of certified 
public expenditures (CPE) or 
intergovernmental transfers in the 
context of the Medicaid EHR incentive 
payments would be inappropriate, since 
these payments do not have a non- 
federal share. If CMS does permit use of 
CPEs in the Medicaid EHR incentive 
program context, CMS must require that 
States pass through the matching funds 
to providers. 
Response: We believe the commenter 
is not clear. As explained above 
incentive payments to providers are 
matched at 100 percent; thus, there is no 
non-Federal share for these payments. 
However, there is a non-Federal share 
necessary for the administration of the 
payment incentives. CMS is reimbursing 
States at 90 percent for reasonable 
expenses related to the administration 
of the payment incentives and States 
must fund the 10 percent non-Federal 
share of Medicaid health information 
technology administrative payments 
consistent with existing rules and 
regulations regarding funding of the 
non-Federal share. Please see our above 
discussion of this issue for further 
detail. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter questioned 
why Medicaid is allowed to determine 
its own requirements and the impact 
this may have on other stakeholders. 
Response: We are clarifying that we 
have provided specific guidance for 
State planning activities that must be 
addressed in order to qualify to receive 
FFP for administering the incentive 
program. We provided guidance in a 
State Medicaid Director’s letter 
published on September 1, 2009, on this 
process. CMS intends to require 
submission of documentation that will 
enable the agency to evaluate whether 
the activities for which FFP was, or may 
be approved for, are being completed 
according to Federal requirements, 
including any terms and conditions of 
FFP approval. States must develop a 
HIT PAPD, a SMHP, and a HIT IAPD. 
These documents would describe the 
processes and resources States will use 
to implement and oversee the EHR 
incentive program, and would help 
States to construct an health IT roadmap 
to develop the systems necessary to 
support providers in their adoption and 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. The development of a 
SMHP (see also § 495.332) also provides 
States with the opportunity to analyze 
and plan for how EHR technology, over 
time, can be used to enhance quality 
and health care outcomes and reduce 
overall health care costs. Our review 
process ensures that States are 
complying with requirements in the 
Act, and that they demonstrate to the 
‘‘satisfaction of the Secretary’’ that they 
are using the funds in the manner 
anticipated by the law. For example, 
because CMS is responsible for 
overseeing States in their administration 
of the Medicaid program, as well as 
ensuring the overall financial integrity 
of the program, States cannot simply 
propose activities in order to secure the 
90 percent FFP. We propose to review 
and prior approve all elements of the 
State’s SMHP, and APD documents 
described in this rule to ensure that all 
of the intended objectives of the 
program are addressed. One of the key 
components of the SMHP is stakeholder 
collaboration and coordination to 
ensure that an integrated strategy is 
developed addressing stakeholder 
needs. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter 
recommended that all the source 
materials needed to create the quality 
measure registry, is submitted to the 
MITA Information Architecture Review 
Board (IARB) for approval as a MITA 
standard and all the source materials be 
added to the MITA artifact repository. 
Doing this will prevent duplicative 
efforts and associated expense both by 
CMS and the participating States. 
Response: We agree with the 
commenter. We support the concept 
that States should apply MITA 
principles to any IT development work 
performed for the EHR incentive 
program, where applicable. If a State 
chooses to integrate a clinical data 
warehouse into its MMIS system, all 
recommended steps, and required 
approvals, for MMIS development, 
including application of MITA 
guidelines, should apply. The goal of 
MITA is not to focus on creating new 
standards so much as utilizing data 
standards developed by other national 
organizations, such as those responsible 
for implementation of HITECH and also 
defining information requirements for 
new business processes. If a State is 
going to develop its own clinical data 
repository to store Medicaid providers’ 
submitted clinical quality measures data 
(one of the MU objectives), then use of 
the MITA Governance boards would be 
a recommended approach. States whose 
SMHPs successfully apply MITA to 
their EHR incentive program systems 
are encouraged to store approved 
artifacts in the Clemson University 
MITA repository so that other States 
may benefit: http://mita.clemson.edu. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter, as a large 
pediatric provider with five physicians 
and four nurses in a relatively rural 
area, is concerned that States have not 
yet sent, or had approved by CMS, the 
State’s Medicaid requirements.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Response: States are in the process of 
developing their SMHPs. States could 
not be approved to start offering 
incentives prior to a final rule becoming 
effective. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: Some commenters asked 
for clarification on how managed care 
entities would be involved in this 
program besides potentially being used 
to disburse incentive payments, as 
mentioned in the proposed rule. 
Examples included things like 
monitoring providers in the health plans 
to ensure compliance. The commenters 
suggested that any work done by the 
managed care entity should be reflected 
in the capitation rate. 
Response: Service agreements 
between States and their managed care 
contractors are not governed by this 
regulation, but must be in compliance 
with 42 CFR part 438. We agree there 
are many opportunities to leverage the 
efficiencies of the managed care entities’ 
activities and role with the larger goals 
and State responsibilities for 
administering the payments. We suggest 
that activities like distributing 
informational materials about the 
incentive program and health IT to 
health plan providers and enrollees 
would fall under most current contracts 
and would be considered part of the 
cost of doing business, which may be 
reflected in the administrative portion 
of the capitation rate. 
If more significant activities are 
expected, such as monitoring and 
reporting information on the providers, 
health plans may exceed the normal 
costs of doing business and what would 
be adequately reflected in the 
administrative portion of the capitation 
rate. An alternative option would be for 
the State and managed care organization 
to have contractual requirements and 
deliverables separate from the capitation 
rate, including the administrative 
component. In the latter scenario, it 
would be acceptable to develop a 
contract amendment specifying the 
terms. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: A commenter asked 
whether or not a State would need to 
file a State Plan Amendment that 
incorporates the SMHP into their State 
Plan, or if the SMHP can stand alone. 
The commenter further asked that if the 
SMHP can stand alone, then would the 
state need to file a State Plan 
Amendment that references the SMHP 
in their plan. 
Response: CMS clarifies that the State 
does not need to file a State Plan 
Amendment or reference the SMHP in 
their State Plan. As part of the Advance 
Planning Document process, the SMHP 
is a deliverable that is submitted to CMS 
for review and approval prior to 
expending funds for the incentive 
program implementation activities. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a

9. Financial Oversight, Program 
Integrity and Provider Appeals 
Pursuant to section 1903(t)(9) of the 
Act, which requires States to conduct 
adequate oversight of the incentive 
program, and in order to ensure that 
ARRA funds are expended wisely and 
in a manner that impedes waste, fraud 
or abuse of Federal taxpayer money, at 
§ 495.366, we proposed requirements for 
States’ financial oversight and 
monitoring of expenditures. 
Additionally, we proposed at § 495.368 
to provide State requirements for 
combating fraud and abuse. 
Specifically, States would be 
responsible for estimating the 
expenditures for the Medicaid EHR 
incentive program on the State’s 
quarterly budget estimate reports. These 
reports are used as the basis for 
Medicaid quarterly grant awards that 
would be advanced to the State for the 
Medicaid EHR incentive program. The 
State submits this Form electronically to 
CMS via the Medicaid and State CHIP 
Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/ 
CBES). States must assure that requests 
for reimbursement of FFP comply with 
all sections of this new part and that the 
amounts reported on the Form CMS–64 
and its attachments represent actual 
expenditures for which all supporting 
documentation, in readily reviewable 
form, has been compiled and which is 
available at the time the claim for 
reimbursement of provider payment 
incentives and administration funding 
is filed. 
We would assure that State 
expenditures claimed for Federal 
matching under the Medicaid program 
are programmatically reasonable, 
allowable, and allocable in accordance 
with existing Federal laws, regulations, 
and policy guidance. States would be 
responsible for establishing policies, 
computer systems, edits to process 
Medicaid EHR incentive payments; and 
for conducting analyses of providers’ 
patterns of practice (data-mining) and 
taking other reasonable steps to ensure 
that no duplicate or otherwise improper 
EHR incentive payments have been 
made. States will be responsible for 
ensuring that provider information, 
including but not limited to, 
attestations, survey, and any 
information added to CMS’ single 
provider election repository indicates 
that any falsification of documentation 
or concealment of material facts may be 
prosecuted under Federal and State 
laws. States would be responsible for 
recovering and returning to CMS FFP 
for any HIT incentive payments that are 
discovered to be improper. State 
Agencies must have information 
processing systems, which may include 
an MMIS—the automated mechanized 
claims processing and information 
retrieval system, to process Medicaid 
EHR incentive payments. MMIS systems 
can also help to manage information for 
program administration and audit 
purposes. 
States must assure that any requests 
for reimbursement of the 90 percent 
Federal match for administration of the 
program are being requested only 
because the State has used the funds for 
purposes related to administering 
payments to qualified Medicaid 
providers for certified EHR technology, 
including for tracking of meaningful use 
of such technology, is conducting 
adequate oversight of the program 
including routine tracking of 
meaningful use attestations and 
reporting mechanisms; and is pursuing 
initiatives to encourage the adoption of 
certified EHR technology to promote 
health care quality and the exchange of 
health care information because of such 
technology. Any initiatives for health 
information exchange must be 
consistent with Federal laws and 
regulations governing the exchange. 
We would monitor State Agency 
compliance through systems 
performance reviews, on-site reviews, 
and audits of the APD process. 
Additionally, we would monitor 
provider demonstration of meaningful 
use. 
As a result of the authority extended 
to the Secretary under section 1902(a)(4) 
of the Act requiring the effective and 
efficient administration of the State 
plan, as well as section 1903(t)(9) of the 
Act, requiring that a State demonstrate 
to the satisfaction of the Secretary that 
it is conducting adequate oversight of 
the program, we also are requiring 
States to establish § 495.370, Provider 
Appeals. This section specifies that 
Medicaid providers who believe that 
they have been denied an incentive 
payment or have received an incorrect 
payment amount under this part 
because of incorrect determinations of 
eligibility, including, but not limited to, 
measuring patient volume; 
demonstrating meaningful use of, or the 
efforts to adopt, implement, or upgrade

Comment: One individual commented 
on potential fraud and abuse 
opportunities if large amounts of 
medical data can be mined, as a result 
of electronic health records. 
Response: First, it is important to note 
that as part of demonstrating meaningful 
use providers will be submitting only 
aggregated, not individually identifiable 
data, to States. Second, we wish to 
clarify that providers will be required to 
comply with the Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act of 
1996 (HIPAA) to the extent that they are 
covered entities. States must provide 
CMS with details about how their 
implementation of the EHR incentive 
program will address Federal and State 
privacy laws and how all data will be 
secured in the SMHP. 
Additionally, the act of preventing 
fraud should be paramount in 
implementing this program. In 
accordance with Section 1903(t)(9) of 
the Social Security Act, States must 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Secretary that they are conducting 
adequate oversight of this program and 
that they are complying with Federal 
requirements to: (a) Ensure the 
qualifications of providers who request 
Medicaid EHR incentive payments, (b) 
detect improper payments and (c) refer 
suspected cases of fraud and abuse to 
the Medicaid fraud control unit. In 
conducting required oversight 
responsibilities, States can receive 90 
percent matching funds for allowable 
expenditures. States are required to 
assure CMS through the State’s 
Medicaid HIT plan that they have 
processes in place to prevent against 
fraud and abuse. CMS will review and 
approve each State’s Medicaid HIT plan. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter noted that 
use of electronic health records may 
provide claims adjudication auditors 
with documentation to verify that items 
or services provided are reasonable and 
necessary, supporting an upfront clean 
claims process and the opportunity to 
conduct pre- and post-pay audits 
without the need to request 
documentation in retrospect. Another 
commenter wanted an assurance that 
CMS will perform audits of a random 
sample of attestation surveys and that 
any providers that are found to be 
making false claims would be penalized 
and listed in a public report posted on 
CMS’ Web site. 
Response: We thank the commenter 
for the comments, but point out that 
meaningful use currently would not 
include using EHRs to provide 
electronic documentation in support of 
claims adjudication. We do, however, 
want to address the issue of pre- and 
post-audits. While one commenter is 
concerned with the process for 
adjudicating claims, the other 
commenter is concerned that there are 
other areas of this program that will 
necessitate pre- and post-pay audits. For 
Medicaid, States are required to provide 
information to CMS in the State 
Medicaid HIT plan outlining the 
processes and methodologies they will 
use to ensure that payments are being 
made to the right person, at the right 
time, for the right reason. Specifically, 
in year one in order to receive an 
incentive payment, providers will be 
attesting to, among other things, 
whether they are using a certified EHR, 
demonstrating meaningful use, 
demonstrating adopting, implementing 
or upgrading certified EHR technology, 
etc. States will be required to ‘‘look 
behind’’ provider attestations. We 
believe that this will require audits both 
pre- and post-pay. CMS believes a 
combination of approaches is in order 
which should result in accurate 
payments. CMS wishes to point out that 
States must provide assurances to CMS 
that they are conducting adequate 
oversight in order to receive the 90 
percent FFP for administration of the 
incentive payments. Additionally, it 
should be noted that this program is 
consistent with other programs under 
Title XIX. States must properly 
administer the program or risk FFP. All 
costs claimed under the program are 
subject to review or audit. Furthermore, 
CMS’ approval of the State Medicaid 
HIT plan does not relieve the State of its 
responsibility to comply with changes 
in Federal laws and regulations and to 
ensure that claims for Federal funding 
are consistent with all applicable 
requirements. We should point out that 
for Medicaid there is no statutory 
requirement to post individual 
provider’s name and/or incentive 
payment program information to the 
CMS Web site. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter is 
concerned about the circumstances 
under which Medicaid is required to 
recoup incentive payments from 
providers. Specifically, the commenter 
requests clarification on the scenario in 
which a provider receives a payment for 
demonstrating adoption, 
implementation, or upgrading EHR 
technology in year one, demonstrating 
meaningful use in years two and three, 
but receives no payment in year four 
because the provider could not 
demonstrate meaningful use. The 
commenter is concerned that Medicaid 
will be responsible for recouping 
payments made in years one, two, and 
three. 
Response: First, it should be noted 
that it is possible for a provider to be 
able to demonstrate meaningful use in 
one year, but not others. Thus, the 
failure of the provider to demonstrate 
meaningful use in year four would not 
necessarily mean that the provider 
failed to demonstrate meaningful use in 
prior years, although it could possibly 
alert the State to more closely review a 
specific provider’s prior year 
attestations or demonstrations of 
meaningful use. For hospitals 
demonstrating meaningful use in both 
the Medicare and Medicaid incentive 
payment programs, CMS will issue 
further guidance about how States will 
be able to access the meaningful use 
data submitted to CMS in order for the 
State to meet its audit and oversight 
requirements. States will be required to 
outline in the SMHP the process for 
‘‘looking behind’’ provider attestations 
and the demonstration of meaningful 
use including any record retention 
requirements. 
In accordance with section 1903(t)(9) 
of the Social Security Act and 
§ 495.332(c) and (e) of the regulations as 
well as § 495.368, States are required to 
include in their State’s Medicaid HIT 
plan processes for detecting improper 
payments and for combating fraud and 
abuse. This would mean that States will 
be responsible for conducting audits of 
providers and ensuring that any 
requests for reimbursement for FFP 
meet all requirements of this subpart. 
When States conduct audits and 
determine that improper payments have 
been made, States are responsible for 
recovering and returning to CMS FFP 
for any incentive payments that are 
discovered to be improper. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: Another commenter is 
concerned with a similar issue. That is, 
the commenter requested that CMS 
identify and develop ‘‘safe harbor’’

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
processes and methods for 
administering the incentive program 
that would assure States that if these 
processes/methods are used, States 
would not be at risk if the processes/ 
methods are less successful than 
anticipated. An example would include 
a process for auditing the adoption, 
implementation, and upgrading process. 
If an audit approach was agreed to but 
ended up being less than effective when 
applied, the State should not be 
responsible for re-auditing providers for 
previous years, nor would it be denied 
participation in the incentive program 
and lose the FFP. Another commenter is 
similarly concerned that this is a new 
program and they requested that CMS 
explicitly recognize the States’ ability to 
revise and redirect the program without 
penalty from CMS. 
Response: Our focus is on ensuring 
that EHR incentive payments are made 
to the eligible provider, and are for the 
correct amount in the appropriate 
payment year (or payment cycle). CMS 
will ensure that State expenditures 
claimed for Federal matching under the 
Medicaid program are programmatically 
reasonable, allowable, and allocable in 
accordance with existing Federal laws, 
regulations, and policy guidance. 
States can receive FFP if they are 
conducting adequate oversight and 
States must provide their plans for 
financial oversight and the processes 
and methodologies they will use to 
verify provider information to CMS for 
review and approval as part of its State’s 
Medicaid HIT plan. We believe States 
may want to consider multiple ways in 
which to audit their providers; for 
example, to ensure that a provider is not 
excluded from the program, the State 
should review on a prepay basis the 
Office of the Inspector General’s List of 
Excluded Individuals and Entities to 
determine if providers are excluded. 
Additionally, States may wish to 
consider attestation in year one for 
demonstrating adopting, implementing, 
or upgrading or meaningfully using 
certified EHR technology. States will 
have to ‘‘look behind’’ these attestations 
and we assume this will be done on a 
post-pay basis. One size does not fit all 
and we believe several audit options 
should be used by States to ensure 
‘‘adequate oversight.’’ However, if it is 
determined that the State’s audit 
methodologies are proving to be less 
than effective we will require that the 
State update its State Medicaid HIT plan 
and present more effective audit 
strategies that will work to accomplish 
conducting adequate oversight of the 
program. States must ensure due 
diligence in conducting adequate 
oversight and all requirements of this 
subpart must be met or FFP could be at 
risk. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
Comment: One commenter requested 
information regarding the appeals 
process. 
Response: For Medicaid, CMS has 
specified the appeals process for a 
Medicaid provider receiving electronic 
health record incentive payments in 
§ 495.370. Specifically, the State must 
have a process in place consistent with 
the requirements established at 
§ 447.253(e) to allow for providers to 
appeal incentive payments, incentive 
payment amounts, provider eligibility 
determinations, and the demonstration 
of adopting, implementing or upgrading 
and meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. CMS is requiring that the 
State Medicaid HIT plan describe the 
process in place for provider appeals. 
We believe the States, not the Federal 
government, are in the best position to 
determine the administrative process 
that would best meet their needs and we 
believe States are in a position to design 
an effective appeal procedure; thus, we 
are providing for a great deal of State 
flexibility. Within the parameters of the 
regulation, States are free to establish 
reasonable criteria for appeals, to limit 
the issues on appeal that may be 
appropriate, or to adopt other 
procedures to prevent frivolous appeals. 
However, State appeal processes should 
be consistent with the requirement in 
§ 447.253(e) for prompt administrative 
review. (States define what would 
constitute a prompt review, and we 
have not specified a time period for 
conducting or concluding a provider 
appeal.) This requirement is in keeping 
with providing States flexibility while 
retaining for providers an opportunity to 
avail themselves of an exception process 
when they believe an exception is 
warranted. Additionally, § 447.253(e) 
provides that the Medicaid agency must 
allow providers an opportunity to 
submit additional evidence. Our 
regulations at § 495.370 also require that 
the appeals processes established by the 
States comply with the State’s own 
administrative procedure laws and that 
the State provide any additional appeal 
rights that would otherwise be available 
under the procedures established by the 
State. 
We are making no additional 
revisions to this section of the rule as a 
result of this comment. 
III. Information Collection 
Requirements 
Under the Paperwork Reduction Act 
of 1995, CMS is required to provide 60- 
day notice in the Federal Register and 
solicit public comment before a 
collection of information requirement is 
submitted to the Office of Management 
and Budget (OMB) for review and 
approval. In order to fairly evaluate 
whether an information collection 
should be approved by OMB, section 
3506(c)(2)(A) of the Paperwork 
Reduction Act of 1995 requires that 
CMS solicit comment on the following 
issues: 
• The need for the information 
collection and its usefulness in carrying 
out the proper functions of our agency. 
• The accuracy of our estimate of the 
information collection burden. 
• The quality, utility, and clarity of 
the information to be collected. 
• Recommendations to minimize the 
information collection burden on the 
affected public, including automated 
collection techniques. 
The following is a discussion of the 
requirements we believe are subject to 
PRA and collection of information 
requirements as a result of this final 
rule. This analysis finalizes our 
projections which were proposed in the 
January 13, 2010 Federal Register (75 
FR 1844 through 2011). The projected 
numbers of EPs and eligible hospitals, 
MA organizations, MA EPs and MA- 
affiliated hospitals are based on the 
numbers used in the impact analysis 
assumptions as well as in Table 32 in 
section IV of this final rule. 
A. ICRs Regarding Demonstration of 
Meaningful Use Criteria (§ 495.8) 
Section 495.8(a)(1) of the proposed 
rule contained requirements for EPs, in 
CY 2011, to attest, through a secure 
mechanism, to meeting meaningful use 
criteria. As described in the proposed 
rule (75 FR 1949), we divided 
meaningful use objectives/measures into 
Sets A and B. We estimated that the 
total burden for an EP to attest to 
§ 495.8(a)(1)(i) and (ii) for Set A 
meaningful use objectives/measures and 
ambulatory quality measures would be 
one hour. For all 442,600 non-hospital- 
based Medicare and Medicaid EPs 
(323,500 Medicare EPs, 80,900 dual 
Medicare/Medicaid EPs, and 38,200 
Medicaid-eligible-only EPs), the burden 
therefore equaled 442,600 hours. We 
estimated that the associated cost 
burden was $79.33 for an EP to attest to 
§ 495.8(a)(1)(i) and (ii) for Set A 
meaningful use objectives/measures and 
ambulatory quality measures, and the 
total associated annual cost burden for 
all EPs to attest was $35,111,458. We 
invited comments on the estimated 
percentages and the numbers of 
(registered) EPs that will attest to the 
above including Set A meaningful use

objectives/measures in CY 2011, but did 
not receive any on this issue. 
In the proposed rule, we also 
estimated that it would take 8 hours for 
an EP to attest to meeting the Set B 
meaningful use objectives/measures. We 
estimated that the total annual burden 
for all 442,600 non-hospital-based EPs 
to attest to Set B meaningful use 
objectives and measures was 3,540,800 
hours. We estimated the associated cost 
burden for an EP to attest was $634.64 
and the total cost burden for all non- 
hospital-based EPs to attest was 
$280,891,664. We solicited comments 
on the estimated percentages and the 
numbers of (registered) EPs that will 
attest to Set B objectives and measures 
in CY 2011, but did not receive any on 
this issue. 
Although, as we proposed, we 
continue to have an attestation 
requirement in § 495.8(a)(1), we are 
revising the burden estimates for two 
reasons. First, as described elsewhere in 
this final rule, the definition of hospital- 
based EP has changed, resulting in 
about 73,000 outpatient hospital EPs 
becoming potentially eligible to 
participate in the EHR incentive 
program. Therefore, we are increasing 
the number of EPs in our burden 
estimates. We estimate that in CY 2011, 
there will be 521,600 non-hospital- 
based Medicare and Medicaid EPs 
(382,000 Medicare EPs, 95,500 dual 
Medicare/Medicaid EPs, and 44,100 
Medicaid-eligible-only EPs) 
participating in the EHR incentive 
program. Second, in response to public 
comments, we have made significant 
changes in § 495.6 meaningful use 
objectives and measures for EPs, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs, which has changed 
the burden estimates. 
In section II.A.2.d. of this final rule, 
Stage 1 Criteria for Meaningful Use in 
this final rule, we have re-categorized 
meaningful use objectives/measures as 
core criteria and menu criteria. Unless 
an exception applies, § 495.6(a) requires 
that an EP must meet all 15 Stage 1 
meaningful use core criteria under 
§ 495.6(d) and 5 out of 10 meaningful 
use menu criteria under § 495.6(e). The 
burden associated with the 
requirements in § 495.8 and § 495.6 is 
the time and effort required to attest to 
the required elements. 
To comply with § 495.8(a)(1), we 
estimate that it would take an EP 8 
hours 52 minutes to prepare and attest 
that during the EHR reporting period, 
the EP used certified technology, specify 
the technology, and satisfied all 15 
mandatory Stage 1 meaningful use core 
criteria. We estimate that it would take 
an EP an additional 0.5 hours to select 
and attest to the clinical quality 
measures, in the format and manner 
specified by CMS. We estimate the total 
burden associated with this requirement 
for an EP is 9 hours 22 minute (8 hours 
52 minutes + 0.5 hours) and the total 
burden for all the EPs to attest to these 
requirements is 4,855,827 hours 
(521,600 EPs × 9 hours 22 minutes). We 
estimate the associated cost burden for 
an EP to attest to these requirements is 
$743.08 (9 hours 22 minutes × $79.33 
(mean hourly rate for physicians based 
on the May 2008 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics)), and the total cost burden for 
all EPs to attest to these requirements is 
$387,592,672 (4,855,827 hours × 
$79.33). 
We recognize that some Stage 1 
meaningful use menu set measures are 
easier to accomplish than others. We 
cannot predict which of the measures in 
the menu set an EP will select. 
Therefore, our burden estimates are 
based on two scenarios to illustrate how 
different scenarios would impact the 
burden incurred. Our ‘‘least 
burdensome’’ or ‘‘low’’ scenario of 
meaningful use demonstration assumes 
that an EP defers the five most 
burdensome objectives/measures while 
our ‘‘most burdensome’’ or ‘‘high’’ 
scenario of meaningful use 
demonstration assumes that an EP 
defers the five least burdensome 
meaningful use menu set measures. We 
recognize that in reality, nothing is 
absolute, and we have no basis for 
estimating the ‘‘all low’’ or ‘‘all high’’ 
scenario and have therefore created 
estimates for both. To compensate for 
the uncertainties of selection of 
meaningful use criteria by an EP, we use 
the averages of the ‘‘high’’ and ‘‘low’’ 
scenario estimates in Table 33. Section 
495.6(a) requires that an EP must meet 
five out of 10 Stage 1 meaningful use 
menu set measures (unless exceptions 
apply). The burden involved is the time 
and effort to select and attest to the 
meaningful use menu set measures. In 
the ‘‘low’’ scenario, we estimate that an 
EP may defer the five most burdensome 
meaningful use measures. We estimate 
it will take an EP 42 minutes to comply 
with the remaining five Stage 1 
meaningful use menu set measures. We 
estimate the total burden for all 521,600 
EPs to comply with the meaningful use 
menu set criteria is 365,120 hours 
(521,600 EPs × 42 minutes). In the high 
scenario, we estimate that an EP may 
defer the five least burdensome 
meaningful use criteria. We estimate 
that it will take an EP 2 hours 40 
minutes to comply with the remaining 
five Stage 1 meaning use menu 
measures. We estimate that the total 
burden for all 521,600 EPs to comply 
with the meaningful use menu set 
criteria is 1,390,586 hours (521,600 EPs 
× 2 hours 40 minutes). Based on the two 
scenarios, the average burden for an EP 
to comply with meaningful use menu 
set criteria is 1 hour 41 minutes ((42 
minutes + 2 hours 40 minutes)/2). Based 
on the two scenarios, the average 
burden for all EPs to comply with 
meaningful use menu set criteria is 
877,853 hours ((365,120 hours + 
1,390,586 hours)/2). We estimate the 
cost burden for an EP to comply with 
the ‘‘low’’ scenario Stage 1 meaningful 
use menu criteria is $55.53 (42 minutes 
× $79.33 (mean hourly rate for 
physicians based on the May 2008 
Bureau of Labor Statistics)), and the 
total cost burden for all 521,600 EPs to 
comply is $28,964,970 (521,600 EPs × 
$55.53). We estimate that the cost 
burden for an EP to comply with the 
‘‘high’’ scenario Stage 1 meaningful use 
menu criteria is $211.49 (2 hours 40 
minutes × $79.33), and the total cost 
burden for all EPs is $110,315.156 
(521,600 EPs × $211.49). The average 
cost burden estimate for an EP to 
comply with the meaningful use menu 
set criteria is $133.51 (($55.53 + 
$211.49)/2). The average cost burden 
estimate for all 521,600 EPs to comply 
with meaningful use menu set criteria is 
$69,640,063 (($28,964,970 + 
$110,315.156)/2). 
In the proposed rule, we expected that 
there would be steady growth in the 
number of participating EPs. We 
estimated that in 2012, there would be 
447,400 non-hospital-based Medicare, 
and Medicaid EPs (326,900 Medicare 
EPs, 81,700 dual Medicare/Medicaid 
EPs and 38,800 Medicaid-eligible-only 
EPs) qualified to receive EHR incentive 
payment. We estimated that the burden 
for meeting § 495.8(a)(2), which 
required attestation for most meaningful 
use measures, and electronic reporting 
of clinical quality measures in CY 2012, 
would be 0.5 hours for an EP to attest 
to the Set A objectives and measures 
and 8 hours to gather information and 
attest to the Meaningful Use Set B 
objectives/measures. For burden 
estimate purposes, we estimated that all 
447,400 non-hospital-based Medicare, 
and Medicaid EPs might attest. We 
estimated that the total annual 
attestation burden for all EPs was 
223,700 hours for the Set A objectives/ 
measures and 3,579,200 hours for Set B 
objectives/measures. We estimated that 
the associated cost burden was $39.67 
for the Set A meaningful use objectives/ 
measures and $634.64 for the Set B 
meaningful use objectives/measures. 
The total cost burden for all EPs was 
$17,746,121 for Set A and $283,937,936

for Set B. We invited comments on the 
estimated percentages and the numbers 
of registered EPs that would attest to 
EHR technology used and Meaningful 
Use Set A and Set B objectives/measures 
in CY 2012, but we did not receive any 
comments on this issue. 
We expect steady growth in EPs in CY 
2012. In the final rule, based on 
legislation altering the definition of 
‘‘hospital-based,’’ we are increasing our 
estimates of participating EPs, and 
estimate that in CY 2012, there will be 
about 527,254 non-hospital-based 
Medicare and Medicaid EPs (385,954 
Medicare EPs, 96,500 dual Medicare/ 
Medicaid EPs and 44,800 Medicaid- 
eligible-only EPs) who are qualified to 
receive EHR incentive payments. The 
Stage 1 meaningful use criteria (core 
and menu sets) are the same for CY 2011 
and CY 2012. We estimate that it would 
take 8 hours 52 minutes for an EP to 
attest that during the EHR reporting 
period, the EP used certified technology, 
specify the technology, and satisfied all 
15 mandatory Stage 1 meaningful use 
core criteria. We estimate the total 
burden associated with this requirement 
for all EPs is -4,675,161 hours (527,254 
EPs × 8 hours 52 minutes). The 
associated cost burden for an EP to 
comply with this requirement is $703.42 
(8 hours 52 minute × $79.33) and the 
associated cost burden for all EPs is 
$370,880.589 (44,675,161 hours × 
$79.33 (mean hourly rate of physicians 
based on the May 2008 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics)). 
The Stage 1 meaningful use objectives 
and measures are the same for CY 2011 
and CY 2012. Therefore, in CY 2012, the 
burden associated with attesting to 
Stage 1 meaningful use core and menu 
criteria for an EP is the same as CY 
2011. Again, we cannot predict which of 
the measures in the menu set will be 
selected by an EP. Therefore, as 
explained above, we use a ‘‘low’’ and 
‘‘high’’ scenario to estimate burden. For 
the ‘‘low’’ scenario, we estimate it will 
take an EP 42 minutes to attest to five 
Stage 1 meaningful use menu-set 
measures. The total burden for all 
527,254 EPs, therefore, would be 
estimated at 369,078 hours (527,254 EPs 
× 42 minutes). Under the ‘‘high’’ 
scenario, we estimate it will take 2 
hours 40 minutes for an EP to attest to 
five Stage 1 meaningful use menu-set 
criteria. The total burden for all 527,254 
EPs, therefore, is estimated to be 
1,405,659 hours (527,254 EPs × 2 hours 
40 minutes). Based on the two 
scenarios, the average burden hours for 
an EP to attest to meaningful use menu 
set measures is 1 hour 41 minutes ((42 
minutes + 2 hours 40 minutes)/2), and 
the total average burden for all EPs is 
887,369 hours ((369,078 hours + 
1,405,659 hours)/2). Under the ‘‘low 
scenario,’’ we estimate that the cost 
burden for an EP is $55.53 (42 minutes 
× $79.33 (mean hourly rate for 
physicians based on the May 2008 
Bureau of Labor Statistics)), and the 
total cost burden for all 527,254 EPs to 
comply with is $29,278,942 (527,254 
EPs × $55.53). For the ‘‘high scenario,’’ 
we estimate that the cost burden is 
$211.49 (2 hours 40 minutes × $79.33), 
and the total cost burden for all EPs is 
$111,510,942 (527,254 EPs × $211.49). 
The average cost burden is $133.51 
(($55.53 + $211.49)/2). The average cost 
burden for all 527,254 EPs is 
$70,394,942 (($29,278,942 + 
111,510,942)/2). 
Section 495.8(a)(2)(iii) requires that 
for CY 2012, EPs must report 
electronically to CMS, or, in the case of 
Medicaid EPs, the States, clinical 
quality information in the form and 
manner specified by CMS. We have 
limited the required measures only to 
those that can be automatically 
calculated by a certified EHR, and to 
those for which we have electronic 
specifications currently available and 
we are able to post as final by the date 
of display of this final rule. The burden 
associated with this requirement is the 
time and efforts to report the required 
clinical quality measures. We estimate 
the burden for an EP to comply with 
this requirement is 0.5 hours and the 
total burden for all EPs to comply with 
this requirement is 263,627 hours 
(527,254 EPs × 0.5 hours). We believed 
that an EP may assign a medical 
secretary to submit the specific clinical 
quality measures to CMS or the States. 
We estimate the cost burden for an EP 
to comply with this requirement is 
$7.40 (0.5 hours × $14.81 (mean hourly 
rate of medical secretaries based on the 
May 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)) 
and the cost burden for all EPs to 
comply with this requirement is 
$3,904,316 (263,627 hours × $14.81). 
To estimate capital costs for EPs, we 
assume a certified EHR system will cost 
roughly $54,000. If 521,600 EPs adopt 
these EHRs, total capital costs prior to 
incentives would be roughly $23.9 
billion. We also estimate that in 2011, 
$0.2 billion of Medicare incentive 
payments and $0.2 billion of Medicaid 
incentive payments would be provided 
to EPs under a low scenario, and $0.6 
billion Medicare incentive payments 
and $0.9 billion of Medicaid incentive 
payments would be provided to EPs 
under a high scenario to help offset 
those costs. Therefore, we estimate that 
total net capital costs for EPs in 2011 
would be $23.5 billion ($23.9 
billion¥$0.2 billion¥$0.2 billion) 
under a low scenario and $22.4 billion 
($23.9 billion¥$0.6 billion¥$0.9 
billion). These capital costs would 
decrease over the course of the EHR 
incentive programs as additional 
incentives are provided. Therefore, in 
2012, the total net capital costs for EPs 
would be $22.1 billion ($23.5 
billion¥$1.0 billion of Medicare 
incentives¥$0.4 billion of Medicaid 
incentives) under the low scenario and 
419.0 billion ($22.4 billion¥$2.3 
billion¥$1.1 billion) under the high 
scenario. 
As with EPs, for eligible hospitals and 
CAHs, we proposed, at section 495.8(b) 
of the proposed rule, that hospitals 
demonstrate they are meaningful EHR 
users through an attestation mechanism. 
As with EPs, we divided meaningful use 
criteria into Sets A and B. We estimated 
that it would take an eligible hospital or 
CAH 0.5 hours to attest to the 
requirements in § 495.8(b)(1)(i) and (ii) 
including the Set A meaningful use 
objectives/measures, .0.5 hours to select 
and attest to the hospital quality 
measures, and 7 hours to comply with 
gathering the information, attesting and 
reporting Set B objectives/measures. 
Therefore, the estimated the total 
burden for all 5,011 Medicare and 
Medicaid eligible hospitals and CAHs 
(3,620 acute care hospitals, 1,302 
critical access hospitals, 78 Medicaid 
children’s hospitals, and 11 Medicaid 
cancer hospitals) equaled 5,011 hours. 
For Set B objectives and measures, we 
estimated the total burden at 35,077 
hours. 
We believed that an eligible hospital 
or CAH might assign an attorney to 
attest on their behalf. We estimated the 
cost burden for an eligible hospital or 
CAH to attest to the Set A and hospital 
quality requirements was $59.98 and the 
total estimated annual cost burden for 
all eligible hospitals and CAHs to attest 
was $300,560. For Set B objectives/ 
measures, we estimated a per-hospital 
cost burden of $419.86, and a total cost 
burden of $2,103,918, not including 
capital costs. We solicited public 
comments on the estimated percentages 
and the numbers of (registered) eligible 
hospitals and CAHs that would attest in 
FY 2011, but we did not receive any 
comments on this issue. We also invited 
comments on the type of personnel or 
staff that would mostly likely attest on 
behalf of eligible hospitals and CAHs, 
but we did not receive any comments on 
this issue. 
For the final rule, as proposed, 
§ 495.8(b) will require demonstration of 
meaningful use through an attestation 
mechanism. However, as with EPs, we 
have revised the burden estimates due 
to the changes in meaningful use

§ 495.6(f) and five out of 10 meaningful 
use menu criteria under § 495.6(g). The 
burden associated with the 
requirements in § 495.8 and § 495.6 is 
the time and effort required to attest to 
the required elements. 
To comply with § 495.8(b)(1), we 
estimate that it would take an eligible 
hospital or CAH 8 hours 42 minutes to 
prepare and attest that during the EHR 
reporting period, the hospital or CAH 
used certified technology, specify the 
technology, and satisfied all 14 
mandatory Stage 1 meaningful use core 
criteria. We estimate that it will take an 
eligible hospital or CAH an extra 0.5 
hours to select and attest to the hospital 
quality measure, in the format and 
manner specified by CMS. We estimate 
the total burden associated with this 
requirement for an eligible hospital or 
CAH is 9 hours 12 minutes (8 hours 42 
minutes + 0.5 hours) and the total 
burden all eligible hospitals and CAHs 
to attest to these requirements is 46,101 
hours (9 hours 12 minutes × 5,011 
hospitals). We believe an eligible 
hospital or CAH may use an attorney to 
attest on their behalf. We estimate the 
associated cost burden for an eligible 
hospital or CAH to attest to these 
requirements is $551.82 (9 hours 12 
minutes × $59.98 (mean hourly rate for 
attorneys based on the May 2008 Bureau 
of Labor Statistics)) and the total cost 
burden for all eligible hospitals and 
CAHs to attest to these requirements is 
$2,765,150 ($551.82 × 5,011 hospitals 
and CAHs)). 
We recognize that some Stage 1 
meaningful use menu criteria are easier 
to accomplish than others. Therefore, as 
with the EPs, our burden estimates are 
based on a ‘‘low’’ and ‘‘high’’ scenario. 
Unless an exception applies, § 495.6(b) 
requires that an eligible hospital or CAH 
must meet five out of 10 Stage 1 
meaningful use menu criteria. The 
burden involved is the time and effort 
to select and attest to the meaningful 
use menu-set measures. Under the ‘‘low’’ 
scenario, we estimate it will take an 
eligible hospital or CAH 42 minutes to 
attest to five Stage 1 meaningful use 
menu-set measures, resulting in a total 
burden for all 5,011 eligible hospitals 
and CAHs of 3,508 hours (5,011 
hospitals × 42 minutes). Under the high 
scenario, we estimate it will take an 
eligible hospital or CAH 3 hours 30 
minutes to attest to five Stage 1 
meaningful use menu-set measures, 
resulting in a total burden for all 5,011 
eligible hospitals and CAHs of 17,539 
hours (5,011 hospitals × 3 hours 30 
minutes). Based on the two scenarios, 
the average burden is 2 hours 6 minutes 
(42 minutes + 3 hours 30 minutes)/2), 
and the average burden for all eligible 
hospitals and CAHs is 10,523 hours 
(3,508 hours + 17,539 hours)/2). 
We believe an eligible hospital or 
CAH may use an attorney to attest on 
their behalf. For menu-set meaningful 
use criteria, low scenario, we estimate 
the associated cost burden for an 
eligible hospital or CAH is $41.99 (42 
minutes × $59.98 (mean hourly rate for 
attorneys based on the May 2008 Bureau 
of Labor Statistics)) and the total cost 
burden for all eligible hospitals and 
CAHs is $210,392 ($41.99 × 5,011 
hospitals and CAHs). For menu-set 
meaningful use criteria, high scenario, 
we estimate the associated cost burden 
for an eligible hospital or CAH is 
$209.93 (3 hours 30 minutes × $59.98) 
and the total cost burden for all eligible 
hospitals and CAHs is $1,051,959 
($209.93 × 5,011 hospitals and CAHs). 
Based on the two scenarios, the average 
cost burden for an eligible hospital or 
CAH to attest to meaningful use menu 
set criteria is $125.96 (($41.99 + 
$209.93)/2). The average burden for all 
eligible hospitals and CAHs to attest to 
meaningful use menu set criteria is 
$631,176 (($210,392 + $1,051,959)/2). 
As with EPs, our proposed regulations 
(at § 495.8(b)(2)) required that for FY 
2012 and subsequent years, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs demonstrate 
meeting most meaningful use criteria 
through attestation, and electronically 
report hospital quality measures. As 
with EPs, we divided meaningful use 
objectives and measures into Sets A and 
B. For Set A, we estimated that it would 
take an eligible hospital or CAH 0.5 
hours to attest to the requirements in 
§ 495.8(b)(2). For Set B, we estimated it 
would take an eligible hospital or CAH 
7 hours to gather information and attest. 
Assuming that 5,011 hospitals might 
attest, we estimated that the total annual 
attestation burden for all eligible 
hospitals and CAHs was 2,506 hours 
(Set A) and 35,077 hours (Set B). We 
estimated the total annual cost burden 
for all eligible hospitals and CAHs to 
attest was $150,310 (Set A) and 
$2,103,918 (Set B). We invited public 
comments on the estimated percentages 
and the numbers of registered EPs that 
would attest to EHR technology used in 
CY 2012, but we did not receive any 
comments on this issue. 
In the final rule, we also require that 
for FY 2012, eligible hospitals and 
CAHs demonstrate meeting meaningful 
use criteria through attestation, except 
for clinical quality measures, which 
must be electronically reported to CMS 
or the States. We do not expect growth 
in the number of eligible hospitals or 
CAHs. The meaningful use criteria (core 
and menu sets) are the same for FY 2011 
and FY 2012. To comply with 
§ 495.8(b)(1), we estimate that it would 
take an eligible hospital or CAH 8 hours 
41 minutes to prepare and attest that 
during the EHR reporting period, the 
eligible hospital or CAH used certified 
technology, specify the technology, and 
satisfied all 14 mandatory Stage 1 
meaningful use core criteria. We 
estimate the total burden associated 
with this requirement for all eligible 
hospitals and CAHs to attest to these 
requirements is 43,596 hours (8 hours 
42 minutes × 5,011 hospitals). We 
believe an eligible hospital or CAH may 
use an attorney to attest on their behalf. 
We estimate the associated cost burden 
for an eligible hospital or CAH to attest 
to these requirements is $521.83 (8 
hours 42 minutes × $59.98 (mean hourly 
rate for attorneys based on the May 2008 
Bureau of Labor Statistics)) and the total 
cost burden for all eligible hospitals and 
CAHs to attest to these requirements is 
$2,614,870 ($521.83 × 5,011 hospitals 
and CAHs). 
We recognize that some Stage 1 
meaningful use menu criteria are easier 
to accomplish than others. We cannot 
predict which of the measures in the 
menu criteria will be selected by an 
eligible hospital or CAH. Therefore, as 
with EPs, our burden estimates are 
based on a ‘‘low’’ and ‘‘high’’ scenario. 
Unless an exception applies, § 495.6(b) 
requires that an eligible hospital or CAH 
must meet five out of 10 Stage 1 
meaningful use menu criteria. The 
burden involved is the time and effort 
to select and attest to the meaningful 
use menu criteria. Under the ‘‘low’’ 
scenario, we estimate it will take an 
eligible hospital or CAH 42 minutes to 
attest to five Stage 1 meaningful use 
menu-set measures, resulting in a total 
burden of 3,508 hours (5,011 hospitals 
× 42 minutes). Under the high scenario, 
we estimate it will take an eligible 
hospital or CAH 3 hours 30 minutes to 
attest to five Stage 1 meaningful use 
menu-set measures, resulting in a total 
burden of 17,539 hours (5,011 hospitals 
× 3 hours 30 minutes). Based on the two 
scenarios, the average burden for an 
eligible hospital or CAH to attest to 
meaningful use menu set criteria is 2 
hours 6 minutes ((42 minutes + 3 hours 
30 minutes)/2), and the average burden 
hours for all eligible hospitals and CAHs 
is 10,523 hours ((3,508 hours + 17,539 
hours)/2). 
We believe an eligible hospital or 
CAH may use an attorney to attest on 
their behalf. For menu-set meaningful 
use criteria, low scenario, we estimate

 44520 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
the associated cost burden for an 
eligible hospital or CAH is $41.99 (42 
minutes × $59.98) and the total cost 
burden for all eligible hospitals and 
CAHs is $210,392 ($41.99 × 5,011 
hospitals and CAHs). For menu-set 
meaningful use criteria, high scenario, 
we estimate the associated cost burden 
for an eligible hospital or CAH is 
$209.93 (3 hours 30 minutes × $59.98) 
and the total cost burden for all eligible 
hospitals and CAHs is $1,051,959 
($209.93 × 5,011 hospitals and CAHs). 
Based on the two scenarios, the average 
cost burden for an eligible hospital or 
CAH to attest to meaningful use menu 
set criteria is $125.96 (($41.99 + 
$209.93)/2). The average burden for all 
eligible hospitals and CAHs to attest to 
meaningful use menu set criteria is 
$631,175 (($210,392 + $1,051,959)/2). 
Section 495.8(b)(2)(iii) requires that 
for FY 2012, eligible hospitals or CAHs 
must report electronically to CMS, or, in 
the case of Medicaid hospitals, the 
States, clinical quality information in 
the format and manner specified by 
CMS. Given that we limit the required 
measures only to those that can be 
automatically calculated by a certified 
EHR and to those for which we have 
electronic specifications currently 
available that we are able to post as final 
by date of display of this final rule. The 
burden associated with this requirement 
is the time and effort to report the 
required hospital quality measures. We 
estimate the burden for an eligible 
hospital or CAH to comply with this 
requirement is 0.5 hours and the total 
burden for all eligible hospitals or CAHs 
to comply with this requirement is 
2,506 hours (5,011 hospitals and CAHs 
× 0.5 hours). We believe that an eligible 
hospital or CAH may assign a medical 
secretary to submit the specific hospital 
clinical quality measures to CMS or the 
States. We estimated the cost burden for 
an eligible hospital or CAH to comply 
with this requirement is $7.40 (0.5 
hours × $14.81 (mean hourly rate of 
medical secretary based on May 2008 
Bureau of Labor Statistics)) and the cost 
burden for all eligible hospitals or CAHs 
to comply with this requirement is 
$37,107 (2,506 hours × $14.81). 
To estimate capital costs for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs, consistent with the 
sources cited in section V.G.4 of this 
final rule, we assume that achieving 
meaningful use will require roughly a 
$5 million capital investment for the 
average hospital. If 5,011 hospitals 
adopt these EHRs, total capital costs 
prior to incentives would be roughly 
$25.1 billion. We also estimate that in 
2011, $0.2 billion of Medicare incentive 
payments and $0.4 billion of Medicaid 
incentive payments would be provided 
to eligible hospitals and CAHs under the 
low scenario, and $0.5 billion of 
Medicare incentive payments and $0.8 
billion of Medicaid incentive payments 
would be provided to eligible hospitals 
and CAHs under the high scenario to 
help offset those costs. Therefore, we 
estimate that total net capital costs for 
hospitals in 2011 would be $24.5 billion 
($25.1 billion¥$0.2 billion¥$0.4 
billion) under the low scenario and 
$23.8 billion ($25.1 billion¥$0.5 
billion¥$0.8 billion) under the high 
scenario. These capital costs would 
decrease over the course of the EHR 
incentive programs as additional 
incentives are provided. Therefore, in 
2012, the total net capital costs for 
hospitals would be $23.5 billion ($24.5 
billion¥$0.9 billion of Medicare 
incentives¥$0.1 billion of Medicaid 
incentives) under the low scenario, and 
$21.4 billion ($23.8 billion¥$2.1 billion 
of Medicare incentives¥$0.3 billion of 
Medicaid incentives) under the high 
scenario. 
Comment: Some commenters believed 
that CMS grossly underestimated the 
cost and hour burden for EPs, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs to comply with 
meaningful use Set A and Set B 
measures. Some commenters stated that 
we should take into consideration all 
the time required to prepare all 
attestation of meaningful use measures, 
including the manual counting of 
numerators and denominators in our 
burden estimates. 
Response: Prior to and after the 
publication of the proposed rule, we 
have worked with ONC to ensure that 
our meaningful use objectives/measures 
are well aligned with certified EHR 
technology. In the final rule, we only 
require meaningful use measures that 
can be achieved by the functionality and 
capability of certified EHR technology. 
Furthermore, based on comments, we 
have explained in section II.A.2.d. of 
this final rule that we are including a 
substantial amount of flexibility in the 
final rule to lower the burden for EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs in meeting 
the attestation and demonstration of 
meaningful use criteria. Some examples 
of such flexibility are the categorization 
of Stage 1 meaningful use core and 
menu (optional) criteria, reducing the 
number of meaningful use objectives/ 
measures for 2011 and 2012, limiting 
the denominators, in certain cases, only 
to patients whose records are 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology, and lowering thresholds for 
many of the meaningful use measures. 
We believe these changes reduce burden 
without compromising the intent of the 
Congress, and the ability of EHR 
technology to begin to improve health 
care quality, efficiency, and outcomes. 
We have considered the comments and 
we have made some revisions on our 
previous burden estimates. While this 
requirement is subject to PRA, we have 
no way of accurately quantifying the 
burden. We will continue to monitor the 
burden associated with the 
implementation of EHR technology as 
our experience continues to grow and as 
EHR technology continues to evolve. 
Comment: CMS received numerous 
comments regarding the burden 
(economic and other) of reporting on the 
large number of measures and the 
overall quality reporting burden this 
will add to EPs and other healthcare 
providers. Others suggested reporting on 
significantly smaller set of measures. 
Response: As we have explained in 
section II.A.3.(d) of this final rule, we 
have reduced the reporting burden by 
decreasing the number of required 
clinical quality measures and limiting 
measures to those that can be 
automatically calculated by a certified 
EHR. We believe that the proposed 
burden estimate, which was estimated 
to be an additional 0.5 hours in 2011 
and 2012, is reasonable and we are 
finalizing it. 
Table 20 below lists the objectives 
and associated measures in which we 
estimate the burden to fulfill ‘‘core set,’’ 
‘‘menu set’’, and clinical quality 
measures requirements. Estimates of 
total capital costs at the bottom of Table 
20 are derived from the estimates used 
in the ‘‘Industry Costs’’ section in 
Section V.G.4. of this final rule.

B. ICRs Regarding Participation 
Requirements for EPs, Eligible 
Hospitals, and CAHs (§ 495.10) 
Since the EHR incentive payment 
program is new, we do not have enough 
information to estimate the information 
collection requirements burden beyond 
the first payment year for an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH for this provision. 
Furthermore, the EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs can enroll any time during 
the first 5 years; therefore, it is difficult 
to predict with certainty the burden 
beyond the first payment year as the 
burden depends on the number of 
participants. Therefore, we provide a 
best estimate of what we believe the 
burden associated with this provision 
might be. 
For the proposed rule, § 495.10(a) 
through (c), we estimated that all 
442,600 non-hospital-based Medicare, 
and Medicaid EPs would register in 
2011 to receive an EHR incentive 
payment, and that it would take no 
more than 0.5 hours to complete the 
registration, resulting in a total 
estimated annual registration burden for 
all EPs of 221,300 hours (442,600 EPs × 
0.5 hours). As we could not predict 
whether an EP or a medical secretary 
(on the EP’s behalf) would register, we 
did one high-end and one low-end 
burden estimate. The cost burden for an 
EP who chose to register in the EHR 
incentive payment program himself or 
herself was $39.67 (0.5 hours × $79.33 
(mean hourly rate for physicians based 
on the May 2008 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics)), with a total estimated 
annual cost burden for all EPs of 
$17,555,729 (221,300 hours × $79.33). 
Similarly, the cost burden for an EP who 
chose to use a medical secretary to 
register on their behalf was $7.41 (0.5 
hours × $14.81), with a total estimated 
annual cost burden for all EPs of 
$3,277,453 (221,300 hours × $14.81). We 
used the average of the two estimates in 
the tally in Table 34 of the proposed 
rule. We invited comments on whether 
we should use the higher cost burden 
estimate ($17,555,729) or the lower cost 
burden estimate ($3,277,453), but we 
did not receive any comments on this 
issue. We invited public comments on 
the estimated percentages or the 
numbers of EPs that will register in CY 
2011 and subsequent years, but we did 
not receive any comments on this issue. 
We are finalizing both the lower cost 
estimate using the medical secretary as 
the personnel registering for the EP and 
the high cost estimate of the EP 
registering him or herself. Due to the 
revised estimates of non-hospital-based 
EPs eligible for the EHR incentive 
program, we are revising our burden 
estimates to reflect this change. In the 
final rule, we estimate that 521,600 non- 
hospital-based Medicare, and Medicaid 
EPs may register in CY 2011 to receive 
an EHR incentive payment. We believe 
that an EP may use a medical secretary 
to register on his/her behalf (low 
burden) or the EP may register him or 
herself (high burden). We estimate that 
it would take no more than 0.5 hours to 
complete the registration. The low cost 
burden for a medical secretary to 
register an EP is $7.41 (0.5 hours × 
$14.81 (mean hourly rate of medical 
secretaries based on the May 2008 
Bureau of Labor statistics)). The total 
estimated annual registration burden 
hours for the low cost estimate is 
260,800 (521,600 EPs × 0.5 hours) in the 
first payment year. The total estimated 
low cost burden for all EPs to register in 
CY 2011 is $3,862,448 (260,800 hours × 
$14.81). The high cost burden for an EP 
to register him or herself is $39.67 (0.5 
hours × $79.33 (mean hourly rate for 
physicians based on the May 2008 
Bureau of Labor Statistics)). In the first 
payment year, the total estimated 
annual registration burden hours for the 
high cost estimate is 260,800 (521,600 
EPs × 0.5 hours). The total estimated 
high cost burden for all EPs to register 
in CY 2011 is $20,689,264 (260,800 
hours × $79.33). We only use the 
average of the two estimates in the tally 
in Table 34. 
Section 495.10(d) proposed that if 
there were subsequent changes in the 
initial registration information, the EP 
was responsible for providing us with 
updated changes in the manner 
specified by us. Based on our 
experience with provider enrollment, 
we estimated that about 11 percent of 
the Medicare and Medicaid EPs might 
need to update their registration 
information during a 1-year period. We 
estimated that 49,214 EPs (11 percent) 
might only have one occasion that 
required updating of information in a 
given year. For each occasion, we 
estimated that it would take no more 
than 0.5 hours to notify us of the 
changes. With that, we estimated that 
the annual total burden hours for 49,214 
EPs to update changes were 24,607. 
However, we could not predict if the EP 
would update the registration 
information himself or herself or assign 
a medical secretary to do it. Therefore, 
we did two burden estimates for an EP 
and his/her medical secretary. The cost 
burden for an EP who chose to update 
the registration information himself or 
herself was $39.67. The total estimated 
annual cost burden for all 49,214 EPs to 
update registration information 
themselves was $1,952,073. Similarly, 
the cost burden for the EP who chose to 
use a medical secretary to update 
registration information on his/her 
behalf was $7.41. The total estimated 
annual cost burden for 49,214 EPs who 
chose to use medical secretaries to 
update registration information on their 
behalf was $364,429. We used the 
average of the two estimates in the tally 
in Table 34. We invited comments on 
whether we should use the higher cost 
burden estimate ($1,952,073) or the 
lower cost burden estimate ($364,429) 
but we did not receive any comments on 
this issue. We also invited public 
comments on the estimated percentages 
and the numbers of EPs that will need 
to submit subsequent registration 
changes to us over the course of the EHR 
incentive payment program but we did 
not receive any comments on this issue. 
We are finalizing both the lower cost 
estimate using the medical secretary as 
the personnel to update registration 
information for the EP and the high cost 
estimate of the EP updating their 
registration information. Due to the 
revised estimates of non-hospital-based 
EPs eligible for the EHR incentive 
program pursuant to legislative 
inclusion of EPs who practice in 
outpatient hospital setting, we are 
revising our burden estimate for this 
requirement to reflect this change. In the 
final rule, we estimate that about 11 
percent of the Medicare and Medicaid 
EPs may need to update their 
registration information during a 1-year 
period. We estimate that 57,998 EPs 
(527,254 (revised estimated number of 
EPs for CY 2012) × 11 percent) may only 
have one occasion that requires them to 
update their information in a given year. 
For each occasion, we estimate that it 
will take no more than 0.5 hours to 
notify us of the changes. With that, we 
estimate that the annual total burden 
hours for 57,998 EPs to update 
registration changes are 28,999. The 
lower cost burden estimate for a medical 
secretary to update an EP’s registration 
is $7.41 ($14.81 (mean hourly rate for 
medical secretary based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics) × 0.5 
hours). The total lower cost burden for 
all EPs to update registration 
information is $429,475 (28,999 hours × 
$14.81). The high cost burden for an EP 
to update their own registration 
information is $39.67 (0.5 hours × 
$79.33 (mean hourly rate for physicians 
based on May 2008 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics)). The total estimated annual 
high cost burden to update registration 
information is $2,300,491 (28,999 hours 
× $79.33). We only use the average of 
the two estimates in the tally in Table 
34.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
In § 495.10(a) and (b), we estimate 
that in FY 2011, there are 5,011 
Medicare and Medicaid eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs that may be 
qualified to receive EHR incentive 
payment. Since we cannot predict how 
many eligible hospitals, and CAHs will 
participate in the EHR incentive 
payment program, we estimate that all 
5,011 hospitals may register for the 
incentive program for burden estimate 
purposes. We estimate that it would 
take no more than 0.5 hours for an 
eligible hospital or CAH to register. We 
estimate the total annual burden hours 
for registration will be 2,506 (5,011 
hospitals × 0.5 hours). Once the 
decision to participate in the incentive 
program is made, we believe eligible 
hospitals or CAHs may assign a medical 
secretary to submit the registration 
information. The cost burden for an 
eligible hospital or CAH to register is 
$7.41 (0.5 hours × $14.81 (mean hourly 
rate for medical secretaries based on the 
May 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). 
We estimate that the total annual cost 
burden for eligible hospitals and CAHs 
to register is $37,106 (5,011 hospitals × 
0.5 hours × $14.81) (mean hourly rate 
for medical secretaries based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). We 
invited public comments on the 
estimated percentages or the number of 
eligible hospitals and CAHs that will 
register for the EHR incentive payment 
program in 2011 and subsequent years 
but we did not receive any comments on 
this issue. We are finalizing the burden 
estimates as proposed. 
In § 495.10(d), we proposed that if 
there were subsequent changes in the 
initial registration information, the 
eligible hospital or CAH was 
responsible for providing us with 
updated information in the manner 
specified by us. Based on our 
experience with provider enrollment, 
we estimated that about 8 percent of the 
Medicare and Medicaid eligible 
hospitals and CAHs (5,011 hospitals and 
CAHs × 8 percent = 401 hospitals) might 
need to update their registration 
information during a 1-year period. We 
estimated that eligible hospitals in this 
8 percent pool might only have 1 
occasion that required updating of 
registration information in a given year. 
For each occasion, we estimated that it 
would take no more than 0.5 hours to 
notify us of the changes. With that, we 
estimated that the total annual burden 
hours for eligible hospitals and CAHs to 
update CMS of registration changes 
were 201 (401 hospitals and CAHs × 0.5 
hours). We believe that eligible 
hospitals or CAHs might assign a 
medical secretary to update the 
registration information. We estimated 
the total annual cost burden for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs to update CMS of 
registration changes is $2,969 (401 
hospitals and CAHs × 0.5 hours × 
$14.81) (mean hourly rate for medical 
secretaries based on the May 2008 
Bureau of Labor Statistics)). We invited 
public comments on the estimated 
percentages and the numbers of eligible 
hospitals and CAHs that will submit 
subsequent registration changes to us 
over the course of the EHR incentive 
payment program but we did not receive 
any comments on this issue. We are 
finalizing the estimated burden for 
hospitals and CAHs that will be making 
subsequent registration changes for FY 
2012 as proposed. 
In § 495.10(e)(1), we proposed that for 
participation in the EHR incentive 
payment programs, prior to the first 
payment year, an EP must notify us in 
a specified manner as to whether he or 
she elects to participate in the Medicare 
or Medicaid EHR incentive program. We 
estimated that in 2011, there would be 
about 80,900 dual Medicare/Medicaid 
EPs who might make the initial 
Medicare and Medicaid program 
selection. The standard full amount of 
Medicaid incentive payments that an EP 
could receive is larger than the standard 
full amount for the Medicare EP 
incentive payments. Therefore, for 
burden estimate purposes, we believed 
that all of the 80,900 dual Medicare/ 
Medicaid EPs might make the Medicaid 
program selection. We estimated that it 
would take no more than 0.5 hours to 
submit the initial Medicare or Medicaid 
selection notification to us. We could 
not predict if the EP would submit the 
notification to CMS himself or herself or 
assign a secretary to do it. Therefore, we 
did one high end estimate and one low 
end burden estimate for an EP and a 
medical secretary respectively. The total 
estimated burden hours for all the dual 
Medicare/Medicaid EPs to notify CMS 
of program selection were 40,450 in the 
first payment year. The cost burden for 
these EPs who notify CMS of Medicare 
or Medicaid program selection himself 
or herself was $39.67. The total 
estimated annual cost burden for all 
dual Medicare/Medicaid EPs to notify 
CMS of program selection themselves 
was $3,208,899. Similarly, the cost 
burden for an EP who chose to use a 
medical secretary to notify CMS of 
program selection was $7.41. The total 
estimated annual cost burden for all 
dual Medicare/Medicaid EPs who use 
medical secretaries to notify CMS of 
program selection was $599,065. We 
used the average of the two estimates in 
the tally in Table 34. We invited 
comments on whether we should use 
the higher cost burden estimate 
($3,208,899) or the lower cost burden 
estimate ($599,065), but we did not 
receive any comments on this issue. We 
also invited public comments on the 
estimated percentages and the number 
of dual Medicare/Medicaid EPs that 
would submit initial Medicare or 
Medicaid program selection in 2011, 
2012, 2013, or 2014 but we did not 
receive any comments. 
In the final rule, we are finalizing 
both the low burden cost estimate using 
a medical secretary for dual-Medicare/ 
Medicaid EPs to notify CMS of program 
selection and the high burden cost 
estimate of an EP who may do this him 
or herself. We have revised the total 
number of dual-Medicare/Medicaid EPs 
and the associated burden estimates 
pursuant to the legislative inclusion of 
EPs, who practice in outpatient hospital, 
in the incentive program. We estimate 
that in CY 2011, there will be 95,500 
dual Medicare/Medicaid EPs who may 
use a medical secretary to notify CMS of 
the initial Medicare and Medicaid 
program selection. We estimate that it 
would take no more than 0.5 hours to 
submit the initial Medicare or Medicaid 
selection notification to us. The 
estimated burden for all the dual- 
Medicare/Medicaid EPs to comply with 
this requirement is 47,750 hours (95,500 
EPs × 0.5 hours). The associated low 
cost burden for a dual-Medicare/ 
Medicaid EP is $7.41 (0.5 hours × 
$14.81 (mean hourly rate for medical 
secretaries based on May 2008 Bureau of 
Labor Statistics) and the total low cost 
burden for all the dual-Medicare/ 
Medicaid EPs is $707,178 (47,750 hours 
× $14.81). The associated high cost 
burden for a dual-Medicare/Medicaid 
EP is $39.67 (0.5 hours × $79.33 (mean 
hourly rate for physicians based on the 
May 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)) 
and the total high cost burden estimate 
for all dual-Medicare/Medicaid EPs is 
$3,788,008 (47,750 hours × $79.33). We 
only use the average of the two 
estimates in the tally in Table 34. 
In § 495.10(e)(2) we proposed that EPs 
might switch from Medicare to 
Medicaid EHR incentive program or 
vice versa one time, and only for 
payment year 2014 or earlier. The 
burden associated with this requirement 
was the time required for the EP to make 
the Medicare/Medicaid program 
selection. Since we had no knowledge 
of how many EPs will make the 
subsequent changes in program 
selection, we assumed that all 81,700 
(estimated number of dual-Medicare/ 
Medicaid EPs for CY 2012) dual 
Medicare/Medicaid EPs might make 
subsequent program selection changes

than 0.5 hours to submit the Medicare/ 
Medicaid selection change to us. We 
could not predict if the EP would 
submit the change to CMS himself or

The higher cost burden for the EP who

estimate that there will be 96,500 dual- 
Medicare/Medicaid EPs. The 
notification will take 0.5 hours and the 
total burden for all dual-Medicare/ 
Medicaid EPs will be 48,250 hours 
(96,500 EPs × 0.5 hours). The lower cost

average of the two estimates in the tally 
in Table 34. 
C. ICRs Regarding Identification of 
Qualifying MA Organizations, MA–EPs 
and MA-Affiliated Eligible Hospitals 
(§ 495.202) 
Section 495.202(a)(1) states that 
beginning with bids due in June 2011 
(for plan year 2012), MA organizations 
seeking reimbursement for qualifying 
MA EPs and qualifying MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals under the MA EHR 
incentive program are required to 
identify themselves to CMS in a form an 
manner specified by CMS, as part of 
submissions of initial bids under section 
1854(a)(1)(A) of the Act. There is no 
burden associated with this requirement 
for qualifying MA organizations offering 
MA HMO plans, since they are deemed 
to meet the definition of HMO in 42 
U.S.C. 300gg–91(b)(3) of the PHS Act in 
accordance with § 495.202(a)(2). 
However, per § 495.202(a)(3), for MA 
organizations offering types of MA plans 
other than HMOs, the burden is the 
amount of time it will take them to 
attest to the fact that they meet the 
definition of HMO in 42 U.S.C. 300gg– 
91(b)(3). We believe the burden 
associated with this requirement for MA 
organizations not offering HMO type 
plans would be approximately 1 hour 
per MA organization. We do not believe 
that there are any MA organizations that 
are not offering MA HMO type plans 
that will request reimbursement for 
qualifying MA EPs or MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals under the MA EHR 
incentive payment program. Although 
the timeframe goes beyond the effective 
date of the proposed information 
collection period (3 years from the 
effective date of the final rule), we do 
not believe there are any MA 
organizations with potentially 
qualifying MA EPs or potentially 
qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals that will need to report to us 
beginning in 2014 (for plan year 2015) 
per § 495.202(a)(4). Therefore, we 
believe there will be no burden 
associated with identification of 
qualifying MA organizations per 
§ 495.202(a)(1) through (4). 
Section 495.202(b)(1) and (2) require 
a qualifying MA organization, as part of 
its initial bid starting with its bid for 
plan year 2012, to make preliminary 
identification of potentially qualifying 
MA EPs and potentially qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals for which the 
organization is seeking incentive 
payments for the current plan year 
(2011). The burden associated with this 
requirement would be the time required 
for a MA organization to identify their 
MA-affiliated hospitals to CMS. In the 
proposed rule, we explained that when 
MAOs identify amounts of 
compensation per § 422.204(b)(2) and 
(5) they will also be identifying MA EPs 
per this requirement, and therefore there 
is will be no additional burden related 
to this requirement with respect to MA 
EPs. There are approximately 29 MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals and 
approximately 12 MA organizations, or 
an average of 2.42 eligible hospitals for 
each MA organization. In the proposed 
rule, we estimated that the total burden 
hours for all MA organizations to 
identify their affiliated hospitals to CMS 
would be 3 hours. We believe a MA 
organization may use a billing clerk to 
identify the eligible hospital to us. The 
total cost burden for all MA 
organizations to identify their eligible 
hospitals to us would be $46.32. 
Sections 495.202(b)(1) and (2), state 
that a MA organization, as part of its 
initial bid starting with plan year 2012, 
must make a preliminary identification 
of potentially qualifying MA EPs and 
potentially qualifying MA-affiliated 
eligible hospitals for which the 
organization is seeking incentive 
payments for the current plan year. A 
qualifying MA organization must 
provide the following information on 
their MA-affiliated EPs and eligible 
hospitals: (A) name of the EP or eligible 
hospital; (B) address of the EP’s practice 
or eligible hospital’s location; and (C) 
NPI. We believe that it is within the 
customary business practices of an MA 
organization to keep the information in 
(A), (B), and (C) on file. The burden 
associated with this requirement would 
be the time required to provide this 
information to CMS along with an 
attestation that the MA EPs or MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals meet the 
eligibility criteria. In the proposed rule, 
we estimated that it would take 0.5 
hours for a MA organization to comply 
with this attestation requirement. We 
estimated that the total burden for all 
MA organizations to attest would be 
6 hours. We believe that MA 
organizations may use an attorney to 
attest on their behalf. In the proposed 
rule, we estimated that the cost burden 
for a MA organization to attest is $29.99 
and the total estimated cost burden for 
all MA organizations to attest would be 
$359.88. 
Section 495.202(b)(4) states that all 
qualifying MA organizations, as part of 
their initial bids in June 2015 for plan 
year 2016, must identify potentially 
qualifying MA EPs and potentially

qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals. An attestation that each 
professional or hospital either meets or 
does not meet the eligibility criteria 
must be included as part of the 
identification submission. We cannot 
estimate the collection burden for this 
requirement as the timeframe goes 
beyond the scope of the effective date of 
the proposed information collection 
period (3 years from the effective date 
of the final rule). 
D. ICRs Regarding Incentive Payments 
to Qualifying MA Organizations for MA– 
EPs and Hospitals (§ 495.204) 
Section 495.204(b)(2) requires a 
qualifying MA organization to report to 
CMS within 60 days of the close of the 
calendar year, the aggregate annual 
amount of revenue attributable to 
providing services that would otherwise 
be covered as professional services 
under Part B received by each qualifying 
MA EP for enrollees in MA plans of the 
MA organization in the payment year. 
Since the tracking of salaries or 
compensation for MA EPs constitutes 
usual and customary business practices, 
the only burden associated with this 
requirement would be the time required 
to submit the aggregated annual amount 
of revenue received by each qualifying 
MA EP for enrollees in MA plans of the 
MA organization. In the proposed rule, 
we estimated that there were 12 MA 
organizations and 28,000 MA EPs. We 
believe that it will take a MA 
organization 40 hours annually to report 
the required aggregate revenue data for 
all its salaried MA EPs, given that all the 
data are readily available. The total 
estimated annual burden hours for all 
MA organizations to comply with this 
requirement would be 480. We believe 
MA organizations may involve a billing 
clerk to report the required data to CMS. 
We estimated that the cost burden for a 
MA organization to report was $617.6 
(40 hours × $15.44 (mean hourly rate of 
billing clerk based on the May 2008 
Bureau of Labor Statistics)) and we 
estimated the total annual cost burden 
for all MA organizations to comply with 
this requirement would be $7,411. 
Section 495.204(b)(4) states that for 
qualifying MA EPs who are 
compensated on a salaried basis, CMS 
requires the qualifying MA organization 
to develop a methodology for estimating 
the portion of each qualifying MA EP’s 
salary attributable to providing services 
that would otherwise be covered under 
Part B to MA plan enrollees of the MA 
organization. The methodology: (i) Must 
be approved by CMS; (ii) may include 
an additional amount related to 
overhead, where appropriate, estimated 
to account for the MA-enrollee related 
Part B practice costs of the salaried 
qualifying MA EP; and (iii) 
methodological proposals must be 
submitted to CMS by June of the 
payment year and must be auditable by 
an independent third party. CMS will 
review and approve or disapprove such 
proposals in a timely manner. In the 
proposed rule, we estimated that it 
might take a MA organization one and 
a half hour to develop the methodology. 
We estimated that there are about two 
MA organizations that may have the 
need to develop the methodology. We 
estimated the total burden hours for the 
two MA organizations to develop the 
methodology would be 3 hours. We 
believed that a MA organization may 
use an accountant to develop the 
methodology. We estimated the cost 
burden for a MA organization was 
$47.48 (1.5 hours × $31.65 (mean hourly 
rate for accountants based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)), and 
the total cost burden for the two MA 
organizations to develop the 
methodology would be $94.95 (47.48 × 
2 MA organizations). 
Section 495.204(b)(5) states that for 
qualifying MA EPs who are not salaried, 
qualifying MA organizations may obtain 
and submit to CMS, attestations from 
such qualifying MA EPs as to the 
amount of compensation received by 
such EPs for MA plan enrollees of the 
MA organization. We estimate that 
about 10 percent of the MA EPs were 
not salaried and that was an average of 
233 non-salaried EPs in each MA 
organization. Further, we estimate that 
it might take 0.25 hour to electronically 
obtain and compile each attestation into 
a document for transmission to CMS. 
We estimate the total burden hours for 
a MA organization would be 58.3, and 
the total estimated burden hours for all 
MA organizations would be 699.6 (58.3 
hours × 12 MA organizations). We 
believe an MA organization may involve 
a billing clerk to compile and submit the 
compensation information from such 
attestations. We estimate the cost 
burden for a MA organizations to 
comply with this requirement would be 
$900.15 (58.3 hours × $15.44 (mean 
salary of a billing clerk based on the 
May 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). 
We estimate the total annual cost 
burden for all MA organizations to 
comply with this requirement would be 
$10,801.82 ($900.15 × 12 MA 
organizations). 
Section 495.204(b)(6) states that for 
qualifying MA EPs who are not salaried, 
qualified MA organizations may also 
have qualifying MA EPs send MA 
organization compensation information 
directly to CMS. We estimated the 
burden associated with this requirement 
is the time it would take the MA EP to 
send the information directly to CMS. 
However, we believe that the non- 
salaried MA EPS are employed by a 
third-party physician group which will 
be responsible for sending the required 
information to CMS. Again, we estimate 
that about 10 percent of the MA EPs are 
not salaried and that there is an average 
of 233 non-salaried EPs in each of the 
third-party physician groups. Further, 
we estimate that it might take 0.25 hour 
to electronically obtain and compile the 
information into a document for 
transmission to CMS. We estimate the 
total burden hours for a third-party 
physician group will be 58.3, and the 
total estimated burden hours for all 
third-party physician groups will be 
699.6 (58.3 hours × 12 third-party 
physician group). We believe a third- 
party physician group may involve a 
billing clerk to compile and submit the 
compensation information. We estimate 
the cost burden for a third-party 
physician group to comply with this 
requirement will be $900.15 (58.3 hours 
× $15.44 (mean salary of a billing clerk 
based on the May 2008 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics)). We estimate the total annual 
cost burden for all third-party physician 
groups to comply with this requirement 
will be $10,801.82 ($900.15 × 12 third- 
party physician groups). Note that this 
is the same burden we estimate with 
respect to § 422.204(b)(5). Further, an 
MAO will either submit non-salary 
information directly to CMS, or it will 
have someone else do it on behalf of the 
MA EPs with respect to that MAO. We 
believe the burden related to 
§ 422.204(b)(6) is counted in the burden 
we already projected with respect to 
§ 422.204(b)(5). We do not believe any 
MAO will submit under both 
§ 422.204(b)(5) and (6). 
E. ICRs Regarding Meaningful User 
Attestation (§ 495.210) 
Section 495.210(b) requires qualifying 
MA organizations to attest within 60 
days after the close of a calendar year 
whether each qualifying MA EP is a 
meaningful EHR user. We anticipate 
that the adopted EHR technology will 
capture the data for determination 
whether each qualifying MA EP is a 
meaningful EHR user. We estimate the 
burden associated with this requirement 
would be the time necessary to attest to 
the required information. We estimated 
that there were approximately 12 MA 
organizations and approximately 28,000 
MA EPs, or an average of approximately 
2,333 MA EPs affiliated with each 
qualifying MA organization. We believe 
that it would take a MA organization 
about 40 hours annually to attest 
whether each qualifying MA EP is a

meaningful user, given that all the data 
are captured in the certified EHR 
technology and that meaningful use will 
be demonstrated through the continued 
reporting of HEDIS data. We estimate 
the total estimated annual burden hours 
for all MA organizations to comply with 
this requirement will be 480. We believe 
MA organizations might involve an 
attorney to attest on their behalf. We 
estimate the cost burden for a MA 
organization to attest will be $2,399 (40 
hours × $59.98 (mean hourly rate of 
attorney based on the May 2008 Bureau 
of Labor Statistics)). We estimate the 
total annual cost burden for all MA 
organizations to comply with attestation 
for MA EPs will be $28,790. 
Section 495.204(c)(2) states that to the 
extent data are available, qualifying MA 
organizations must receive hospital 
incentive payments through their 
affiliated hospitals under the Medicare 
FFS EHR hospital incentive program, 
rather than through the MA EHR 
hospital incentive program. Under 
§ 495.210(c), we proposed that 
qualifying MA organizations be required 
to attest within 60 days after the close 
of a calendar year whether each 
qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospital is a meaningful EHR user. 
While the EHR incentive payments for 
Medicare FFS and MA-affiliated 
hospitals are treated the same as all 
Medicare-certified MA affiliated 
hospitals they will demonstrate clinical 
quality measures through the continued 
reporting of HEDIS data. This means 
that § 495.210(c) generally applies to a 
MA-affiliated hospital that is not 
Medicare certified, and such a type of 
hospitals does not exist currently. We 
do not expect there to be any MA- 
affiliated hospitals that will not be 
covered under the Medicare FFS EHR 
hospital incentive program because 
section 1852(a)(1)(A) of the Act requires 
MA organizations to provide Part A 
inpatient services solely through 
providers that meet applicable 
requirements of the Medicare program. 
We have already addressed the 
attestation burden on hospitals, 
including MA-affiliated hospitals under 
§ 495.10(b)(2)(i)(ii) and through our 
existing PRA package related to HEDIS 
reporting by MA organizations—OMB 
control number 0938–NEW. 
F. ICRs Regarding Establishing Patient 
Volume (§ 495.306) 
This section of the final rule contains 
patient volume requirements, and 
requires EPs and certain hospitals to 
attest to meeting such requirement using 
representative periods in order to 
qualify for a Medicaid EHR incentive. 
The minimum patient volume 
requirements are as follows: 30 percent 
Medicaid patient volume for most EPs, 
20 percent Medicaid patient volume for 
pediatricians, 30 percent needy 
individual patient volume for EPs 
practicing predominantly in an FQHC or 
RHC, and 10 percent Medicaid patient 
volume for acute-care hospitals. The 
burden associated with the 
requirements in this section is the time 
and effort necessary to submit the 
information to CMS. In the proposed 
rule, in each instance, we estimated it 
would take no longer than 0.5 hours to 
submit the necessary information to 
CMS. We estimated that 119,000 entities 
would submit the required information 
to meet 30 percent (or 20 percent 
pediatrician) requirements for most EPs. 
We estimated the total annual burden to 
be 59,500 hours, with total labor cost 
amounting to $4,720,135 (assuming that 
physicians (rather than staff assistants) 
establish patient volume ($79.33 mean 
hourly rate for physicians based on May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics). 
For hospitals to attest to patient 
volume, we estimated that 3,631 entities 
would submit required information, and 
estimated a total burden of 1,815.50 
hours (3,631 entities × .5 hours). The 
total labor cost associated with this 
requirement is $25,617. This cost 
burden was based on a secretary 
reporting patient volume on behalf of 
the acute care hospital at $14.11 (mean 
hourly rate for secretaries based on May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics). 
We received no comments on this 
section; however, since we have revised 
our definition of hospital-based EP, the 
burden is revised to account for the 
additional number of Medicaid EPs that 
could now be eligible to receive 
Medicaid incentive payments. We 
currently estimate that there are an 
additional Medicare/Medicaid 75,700 
EPs that could be eligible for an 
incentive payment because of the new 
definition of hospital-based EP. We 
believe there are 553,200 Medicare EPs 
of which 86 percent are non-hospital 
based or 477,500. We believe 20 percent 
or 95,500 will meet patient volume 
requirements, and therefore, potentially 
qualify for Medicaid EHR incentive 
payments. Additionally, there are 
44,100 Medicaid-only EPs (nurse 
practitioners, certified nurse-midwives, 
dentists, and physician assistants) that 
we believe will meet patient volume. 
Specifically, we believe that 139,600 
EPs (95,500 + 44,100) could be reporting 
patient volume information. Thus, the 
updated annual burden associated with 
the requirements in § 495.306 at 0.5 
hours for EPs is 69,800. 
The total labor cost associated with 
the requirement is (69,800 × 79.33) 
$5,537,234. The total labor cost 
associated with each requirement is 
$5,537,234. 
For hospitals reporting patient 
volume, we have updated the burden to 
account for the additional CAHs that 
meet the definition of acute care 
hospital. Specifically, there are 3,620 
acute care hospitals, 11 cancer 
hospitals, and 1,302 CAHs that must 
report 10 percent Medicaid patient 
volume, or 4,933 entities. The updated 
annual burden associated with the 
requirement, at 0.5 hours is 2,466.5 
(4,933 × .05). The total labor cost is 
$34,803.30. 
G. ICRs Regarding Process for Payments 
(§ 495.312) 
Section 495.312(b) states that in order 
to receive a Medicaid EHR incentive 
payment, a provider must report all 
necessary data (including data required 
by subpart A of the regulations, such as 
meaningful use data) within the EHR 
reporting period. We believe the 
information collections associated with 
this requirement are discussed in the 
relevant sections discussing each 
particular requirement that would 
necessitate data reporting (for example, 
the burden for demonstrating 
meaningful use is discussed in the 
information collection section on 
meaningful use). Therefore, we have not 
calculated a separate information 
collection burden for this requirement. 
H. ICRs Regarding Activities Required 
To Receive an Incentive Payment 
(§ 495.314) 
Section 495.314(a)(1) states that in the 
first payment year, to receive an 
incentive payment, the Medicaid EP or 
eligible hospital must meet one of the 
following criteria. The Medicaid EP or 
eligible hospital must demonstrate that 
during the EHR reporting period for a 
payment year, it has adopted, 
implemented, or upgraded certified EHR 
technology, as defined in § 495.302; or, 
the Medicaid EP or eligible hospital 
must demonstrate that during the EHR 
reporting period for a payment year it is 
a meaningful user of certified EHR 
technology as defined in § 495.4. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements in proposed 
§ 495.314(a)(1) is the time and effort 
necessary for a Medicaid EP or eligible 
hospital to demonstrate that it meets 
one of the criteria in § 495.314(a)(1)(i) 
through (ii). We believe we already 
accounted for this burden in the earlier 
discussion of the burden associated 
with § 495.8. 
Section 495.314(a)(2) states that a 
provider may notify the State of its 
nonbinding intention to participate in

the incentives program prior to having 
fulfilled all of the eligibility criteria. 
This requirement constitutes a third- 
party disclosure. The burden associated 
with this requirement is the time and 
effort necessary for a provider to send 
notification to the State. We estimated 
that this burden will be the same burden 
associated with § 495.10 since the 
information necessary to notify the State 
of the providers non-binding intention 
to participate in the program could be 
the same information as submitted by 
those providers that have committed to 
participating in the program, that is, the 
National Provider Identifier, the tax 
identification number, etc. 
Section 495.314(b)(1) states that in the 
second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth 
payment years, to receive an incentive 
payment, the Medicaid EP or eligible 
hospital must demonstrate that during 
the EHR reporting period for the 
applicable payment year, it is a 
meaningful user of certified EHR 
technology, as defined in § 495.4. The 
burden associated with this requirement 
is the time and effort necessary for a 
Medicaid EP or eligible hospital to 
demonstrate that it is a meaningful user 
of certified EHR technology. We 
discussed the burden associated with 
this requirement in our discussion of 
the burden associated with § 495.6 and 
495.8. 
We did not receive any comments on 
the information collection burdens we 
estimated for the proposed rule. 
I. ICRs Regarding State Monitoring and 
Reporting Regarding Activities Required 
To Receive an Incentive Payment 
(§ 495.316) 
Section 495.316(a) requires States to 
be responsible for tracking and verifying 
the activities necessary for a Medicaid 
EP or eligible hospital to receive an 
incentive payment for each payment 
year, as described in § 495.314. Burden 
is calculated for each State’s process for 
the administration of the Medicaid 
incentive payments, including tracking 
of attestations and oversight, and the 
process for approving, processing, and 
making timely payments. 
For the proposed rule, we estimated 
that it would take 5 hours per State to 
accomplish this. The estimated annual 
burden for States associated with the 
aforementioned submission 
requirements is 280 hours (56 States- 
Territories × 5.0 hours/State-Territory). 
The cost burden was estimated based on 
an employee contracting with the State 
Agency. The burden associated with 
§ 495.316 is already in the OMB 
approval process. We announced the 
information collection in a Federal 
Register notice that published on 
September 11, 2009 (74 FR 467330). 
Comment: Some commenters asked 
CMS to clarify if States are responsible 
for collecting the MU measure data or if 
providers will report data directly to 
CMS. If the collection and reporting of 
MU data are States’ responsibility, this 
would create tremendous burden on 
States. The commenters also asked CMS 
to clarify if States are responsible for 
validating attestations by eligible 
providers. 
Response: For EPs and some 
hospitals, States are responsible for 
collecting the MU measure data; for 
hospitals that are eligible for both the 
Medicare and Medicaid incentives, 
hospitals that meet the Medicare MU 
objectives are deemed to have met MU 
for Medicaid; thus, since hospitals are 
required to report MU data to CMS for 
the Medicare EHR incentives program, 
these hospitals do not, in addition, have 
to report MU data to States. States are 
required to submit a State Medicaid HIT 
plan to CMS for review and approval 
outlining their methodology for 
collecting MU measure data and other 
required information outlined in this 
final rule. States are also responsible for 
validating attestations by providers. We 
do not believe collecting data or 
validating attestations is a tremendous 
burden on States as noted by our 
estimates. States can receive 90 percent 
FFP for administering the incentive 
payments to providers and for 
conducting adequate monitoring and 
oversight. In addition, it should be 
noted that States voluntarily participate 
in the Medicaid EHR incentive program. 
J. ICRs Regarding State Responsibilities 
for Receiving FFP (§ 495.318) 
Section 495.318 states that in order to 
be provided FFP under section 
1903(a)(3)(F) of the Act, a State must 
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the 
Department, that the State is conducting 
the activities listed at § 495.318(a) 
through (c). This burden is the same as 
that listed above in the burden 
discussion for § 495.316. 
K. ICRs Regarding Prior Approval 
Conditions (§ 495.324) 
Section 495.324(a) requires a State to 
obtain prior written approval from the 
Department as specified in paragraph (b) 
of this section, when the State plans to 
initiate planning and implementation 
activities in support of Medicaid 
provider incentive payments 
encouraging the adoption and use of 
certified EHR technology with proposed 
Federal financial participation (FFP). 
Specifically, § 495.324(b) states that to 
receive 90 percent match, each State 
must receive prior approval for all of the 
requirements listed in § 495.324(b)(1) 
through (3). 
Section 495.324(c) requires a State to 
obtain prior written approval from the 
Department of its justification for a sole 
source acquisition, when it plans to 
acquire non-competitively from a 
nongovernmental source HIT equipment 
or services, with proposed FFP under 
subpart D of Part 495 in the regulations, 
if the total State and Federal acquisition 
cost is more than $100,000. Burden 
must be calculated for State Medicaid 
Agencies to submit the planning and 
implementation documents and the 
SMHP to CMS. This burden is the same 
as that listed above in the burden 
discussion for § 495.316. 
L. ICRs Regarding Termination of 
Federal Financial Participation (FFP) for 
Failure To Provide Access to 
Information (§ 495.330) 
Section 495.330(a) states that the 
Department can terminate FFP at any 
time if the Medicaid agency fails to 
provide State and Federal 
representatives with full access to 
records relating to HIT planning and 
implementation efforts, and the systems 
used to interoperate with electronic 
HIT, including on-site inspection. 
Section 495.330(b) states that the 
Department may request such access at 
any time to determine whether the 
conditions in this subpart are being met. 
The burden associated with the 
requirements in this section is the time 
and effort necessary to make the 
information available to the Department 
upon request so it can monitor 
compliance. The Department estimated 
that it will make 1 request per State/ 
Territory per year for information and 
that it will take each State 5 hours to 
compile and furnish the information. 
For States to collect and submit the 
information required, we estimated it 
would take 5 hours per State. The 
estimated annual burden for States 
associated with the aforementioned 
submission requirements is 280 hours 
(56 States-Territories × 5.0 hours/State- 
Territory). 
The annual cost burden for a State 
employee to provide the above 
information is $9,904 (280 hours × 
$35.37 (mean hourly rate for a 
management analyst based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). We 
believe that a secretary may compile 
State information and provide the 
information to the Department. In that 
case the annual cost burden for the 
secretary to provide this information is 
$3,951 (280 hours × $14.11 (mean 
hourly rate for secretaries based on the 
May 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)).

M. ICRs Regarding State Medicaid 
Agency and Medicaid EP and Hospital 
Activities (§ 495.332 Through § 495.344) 
The burden associated with this 
section is the time and effort associated 
with completing the single provider 
election repository and each State’s 
process for the administration of the 
Medicaid incentive payments, including 
tracking of attestations and oversight; 
the submission of the State Medicaid 
HIT Plan and the additional planning 
and implementation documents; 
enrollment or reenrollment of providers, 
and collection and submission of the 
data for providers to demonstrate that 
they have adopted, implemented, or 
upgraded certified EHR technology or 
that they are meaningful users of such 
technology. We believe much of the 
burden associated with these 
requirements has already been 
accounted for in our discussion of the 
burden for § 495.316. 
N. ICRs Regarding Access to Systems 
and Records (§ 495.346) 
Section 495.346 states that the State 
agency must allow the Department 
access to all records and systems 
operated by the State in support of this 
program, including cost records 
associated with approved administrative 
funding and incentive payments to 
Medicaid providers. State records 
related to contractors employed for the 
purpose of assisting with 
implementation or oversight activities 
or providing assistance, at such 
intervals as are deemed necessary by the 
Department to determine whether the 
conditions for approval are being met 
and to determine the efficiency, 
economy, and effectiveness of the 
program. 
The Department believes that the 
burden associated with maintaining the 
records is exempt under 5 CFR 
1320.3(b)(2) as this burden is part of a 
usual and customary business practice; 
the time, effort, and financial resources 
necessary to comply with a collection of 
information that would be incurred by 
persons in the normal course of their 
activities (for example, in compiling and 
maintaining business records) will be 
excluded from the ‘‘burden’’ if the 
agency demonstrates that the reporting, 
recordkeeping, or disclosure activities 
needed to comply are usual and 
customary. 
However, there is burden associated 
with making the information available 
to the Department upon request. This 
burden is described in the burden 
discussion for § 495.330. 
O. ICRs Regarding Procurement 
Standards (§ 495.348) 
Section 495.348(c) states that a 
grantee must maintain written standards 
of conduct governing the performance of 
its employees engaged in the award and 
administration of contracts. Although 
most States may already have these 
written standards of conduct, we have 
estimated the burden associated with 
this requirement as the time and effort 
necessary for a grantee to develop and 
maintain written standards of conduct. 
We estimate it will take each of the 56 
grantees 0.5 hours to develop and 
maintain standards of conduct. The total 
estimated annual burden is 28 hours (56 
grantees × 0.5 hours). The annual cost 
burden for a grantee to develop and 
maintain standards of conduct is $990 
(28 hours × $35.37 (mean hourly rate for 
a management analyst based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). 
Section 495.348(e) requires that all 
grantees establish written procurement 
procedures. At a minimum, the 
standards must provide for the 
information listed in § 495.348(e)(1) 
through (13). The burden associated 
with this requirement is the time and 
effort necessary for a grantee to develop 
and maintain written procurement 
procedures. Although most States 
probably have these procedures already, 
we estimate that it will take each of the 
56 grantees 0.5 hours to develop and 
maintain written procurement 
procedures. The total estimated annual 
burden is 28 hours (56 grantees × 0.5 
hours). The annual cost burden for a 
grantee to develop and maintain written 
procurement procedures is $990 (28 
hours × $35.37 (mean hourly rate for a 
management analyst based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). 
Section 495.348(f) imposes 
recordkeeping requirements. This 
section states that a system for contract 
administration must be maintained to 
ensure contractor performance with the 
terms, conditions and specifications of 
the contract and to ensure adequate and 
timely follow up on all purchases. The 
burden associated with this requirement 
is the time and effort necessary to 
develop and maintain a system for 
contract administration. We estimate 
that it will take each of the 56 grantees 
5 hours to develop and maintain a 
system for contract administration. The 
total estimated annual burden is 280 
hours (56 grantees × 5 hours). The 
annual cost burden for a grantee to 
develop and maintain a system for 
contract administration is $9,904 (280 
hours × $35.37 (mean hourly rate for a 
management analyst based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). 
P. ICRs Regarding State Medicaid 
Agency Attestations (§ 495.350) 
Section 495.350 requires States to 
provide assurances to the Department 
that amounts received with respect to 
sums expended that are attributable to 
payments to a Medicaid provider for the 
adoption of EHR are paid directly to 
such provider, or to an employer or 
facility to which such provider has 
assigned payments, without any 
deduction or rebate. The burden 
associated with this requirement is the 
time and effort necessary for a State to 
verify that the sums expended are 
attributable to payments to a Medicaid 
provider for the adoption of EHR are 
paid directly to such provider, or to an 
employer or facility to which such 
provider has assigned payments, 
without any deduction or rebate. 
Additionally, there is burden associated 
with submitting an attestation to the 
Department to that effect. The estimated 
burden associated with these 
requirements is 0.5 hours to verify the 
information and 0.5 hours to submit the 
attestation to the Department, for a total 
of 1 hour. The estimated annual burden 
for States associated with the 
aforementioned submission 
requirements is 56 hours (56 States- 
Territories × 1 hour State-Territory). The 
annual cost burden for a State employee 
to provide the above information is 
$1,981 (56 hours × $35.37 (mean hourly 
rate for a management analyst based on 
the May 2008 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics)). We believe that that a 
secretary may compile State information 
and provide the information to the 
Department. In that case the annual cost 
burden for the secretary to provide this 
information is $790 (56 hours × $14.11 
(mean hourly rate for secretaries based 
on the May 2008 Bureau of Labor 
Statistics)). 
Q. ICRs Regarding Reporting 
Requirements (§ 495.352) 
Section 495.352 requires each State to 
submit to the Department on a quarterly 
basis a progress report documenting 
specific implementation and oversight 
activities performed during the quarter, 
including progress in implementing the 
State’s approved Medicaid HIT plan. 
The burden associated with this 
requirement is the time and effort 
necessary for a State to draft and submit 
quarterly progress reports to the 
Department. For States to collect and 
submit the information required, we 
estimate it will take 5 hours per State. 
The estimated annual burden for States 
associated with the aforementioned 
submission requirements is 280 hours

information is $9,904 (280 hours × 
$35.37 (mean hourly rate for a 
management analyst based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). We 
believe that a secretary may compile 
State information and provide the 
information to the Department. In that 
case the annual cost burden for the 
secretary to provide this information is 
$3,951 (280 hours × $14.11 (mean 
hourly rate for secretaries based on the 
May 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). 
R. ICRs Regarding Retroactive Approval 
of FFP With an Effective Date of 
February 18, 2009 (§ 495.362) 
Section 495.362 states that for 
administrative activities performed by a 
State, without obtaining prior approval, 
which are in support of planning for 
incentive payments to providers, a State 
may request consideration of FFP by 
recorded request in a HIT planning 
advance planning document or 
implementation advance planning 
document update. While this 
requirement is subject to the PRA, we 
believe the burden is already covered in 
the discussion of proposed § 495.332 
through § 495.344. 
S. ICRs Regarding Financial Oversight 
and Monitoring Expenditures 
(§ 495.366) 
Section 495.366(a)(2) requires a State 
to have a process in place to report 
actual expenditures for the Medicaid 
EHR incentive program using the 
Medicaid Budget Expenditure System. 
Since States already have to report 
Medicaid expenditures to the Medicaid 
Budget and Expenditure System, there 
is no need for States to develop and 
implement a reporting process. 
However, States will need to estimate 
and report the expenditures related to 
the provider incentive payments and the 
cost of the administration of the 
incentive payments. The estimated 
annual burden for States associated with 
the aforementioned requirements is 280 
hours (56 States-Territories × 5 hours 
State-Territory). 
The annual cost burden for a State 
employee to provide the above 
information is $9,904 (280 hours × 
$35.37 (mean hourly rate for a 
management analyst based on the May 
2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). We 
believe that a secretary may compile 
State information and provide the 
information to the Department. In that 
case the annual cost burden for the 
secretary to provide this information is 
$3,951 (280 hours × $14.11 (mean 
hourly rate for secretaries based on the 
May 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics)). 
Section 495.366(a)(3) requires a State 
to have an automated payment and 
information retrieval mechanized 
system, (Medicaid Management 
Information System) to make EHR 
payment incentives, to ensure Medicaid 
provider eligibility, to ensure the 
accuracy of payment incentives, and to 
identify potential improper payments. 
Since States already have an automated 
payment and information retrieval 
system, there is no need to estimate this 
burden. 
Section 495.366(b) lists the 
information collection requirements 
associated with provider eligibility as a 
basis for making payment. States must, 
subject to § 495.332, collect and verify 
information on Medicaid providers. 
This burden is the same as that listed 
above in the discussion of § 495.316. 
Section § 495.366(c)(1) states that 
subject to § 495.332, the State must 
annually collect and verify information 
regarding the efforts to adopt, 
implement, or upgrade certified EHR 
technology and the meaningful use of 
said technology before making any 
payments to providers. This burden has 
already been discussed in our burden 
explanation for § 495.8. 
Section 495.366(d)(1) states that 
subject to paragraph § 495.332, the State 
must assure that State expenditures are 
claimed in accordance with, including 
but not limited to, applicable Federal 
laws, regulations and policy guidance. 
Section 495.366(d)(2) specifies that 
subject to § 495.332, the State must have 
a process in place to assure that 
expenditures for administering the 
Medicaid EHR incentive payment 
program will not be claimed at amounts 
higher than 90 percent of the cost of 
such administration. Section 
495.366(d)(3) states that subject to 
§ 495.332, the State must have a process 
in place to assure that expenditures for 
payment of Medicaid EHR incentive 
payments will not be claimed at 
amounts higher than 100 percent of the 
cost of such payments to Medicaid 
providers. This burden is the same as 
that listed above in the discussion of 
§ 495.316. 
Section 495.366(e) discusses the 
information collection requirements 
associated with improper Medicaid 
electronic health record payment 
incentives. The burden associated with 
the requirements listed in proposed 
§ 495.366(e)(1) through (7) is the time 
and effort necessary to develop 
processes to provide the necessary 
assurances discussed in this section. 
This burden is the same as that listed 
above in the discussion of § 495.316. 
T. ICRs Regarding Appeals Process for 
a Medicaid Provider Receiving 
Electronic Health Record Incentive 
Payments (§ 495.370) 
Section 495.370(a) requires states to 
have a process in place consistent with 
the requirements established in 
§ 447.253(e) for a provider or entity to 
appeal incentive payments, incentive 
payment amounts, provider eligibility 
determinations, and the demonstration 
of adopting, implementing, or upgrading 
and meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. This burden is the same as 
that listed above in the discussion of 
§ 495.316. 
We continue to believe that these 
numbers are subject to a substantial 
amount of uncertainty and actual 
experience may be significantly 
different. The range of possible 
experience is greater than under most 
other rules for the following reason; 
specifically, this rule provides the 
option for States to participate in the 
Medicaid certified electronic health 
record technology incentive payment 
program. To the extent that States 
participate more or less than assumed 
here (that is, the number of States, EPs 
and hospitals) the burden associated 
may be greater than or less than 
estimated. 
U. General Comments Regarding the 
Information Collection Requirements 
Comment: Some commenters 
recommended that EPs and eligible 
hospitals should start tracking time and 
resources estimates on their overall cost 
for complying with all the required data 
collection to achieve meaningful use 
during the reporting period. They 
believed the information is beneficial 
for CMS in developing and assessing 
future meaningful use objectives and 
measures. 
Response: We welcome provider 
input on the required resources to 
comply with the meaningful use 
requirements. We believe the 
information would help us to fine-tune 
burden estimates for future rulemaking 
for subsequent stages of meaningful use 
demonstration.

IV. Regulatory Impact Analysis 
A. Overall Impact 
We have examined the final impacts 
of this rule as required by Executive 
Order 12866, the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act, section 1102(b) of the Social 
Security Act regarding rural hospital 
impacts, the Unfunded Mandates 
Reform Act, Executive Order 13132 on 
Federalism, and the Congressional 
Review Act. 
Executive Order 12866 directs 
agencies to assess all costs and benefits 
of available regulatory alternatives and, 
if regulation is necessary, to select 
regulatory approaches that maximize 
net benefits (including potential 
economic, environmental, public health 
and safety effects, distributive impacts, 
and equity). A regulatory impact 
analysis (RIA) must be prepared for 
rules with economically significant 
effects ($100 million or more in any 1 
year). This final rule is anticipated to 
have an annual effect on the economy 
of $100 million or more, making it an 
economically significant rule under the 
Executive Order and a major rule under 
the Congressional Review Act. 
Accordingly, we have prepared a RIA 
that to the best of our ability presents 
the costs and benefits of the final rule. 
This final rule is one of three 
coordinated rulemakings undertaken to 
implement the goals and objectives of 
the HITECH Act related to the adoption 
and meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. The other two are HHS’s 
interim final rule establishing 
certification criteria, standards, and 
implementation specifications for 
certification of EHR systems, and HHS’ 
final rule on EHR certification programs. 
Each rule assessed the direct economic 
effects of its provisions. This final rule 
on Medicare and Medicaid EHR 
Incentive Programs addresses the 
impacts related to the actions taken by 
EPs or eligible hospitals, or CAHs to 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology, including purchasing 
or developing in-house certified EHR 
technology or EHR technology modules. 
A number of factors will affect the 
adoption of EHR systems and 
demonstration of meaningful use. Many 
of these are addressed in this final 
analysis, but also the final provisions of 
the other rules. Readers should 
understand that these forecasts are also 
subject to substantial uncertainty since 
demonstration of meaningful use will 
depend not only on the standards and 
requirements for FYs 2011 and 2012 for 
eligible hospitals and CYs 2011 and 
2012 for EPs, but on future rulemakings 
issued by the HHS. 
The HITECH Act provides Medicare 
and Medicaid incentive payments for 
the meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. Additionally, the Medicaid 
program also provides incentives for the 
adoption, implementation, and upgrade 
of certified EHR technology. Payment 
adjustments are incorporated into the 
Medicare program for providers unable 
to demonstrate meaningful use. The 
absolute and relative strength of these is 
unclear. For example, a provider with 
relatively small Medicare billings will 
be less disadvantaged by payment 
adjustments than one with relatively 
large Medicare billings. Another 
uncertainty arises because there are 
likely to be ‘‘bandwagon’’ effects as the 
number of providers using EHRs rises, 
thereby inducing more participation in 
the incentives program, as well as 
greater adoption by entities (for 
example, clinical laboratories) that are 
not eligible for incentives or subject to 
penalties, but do business with EHR 
adopters. It is impossible to predict 
exactly if and when such effects may 
take hold. 
One legislative uncertainty arises 
because under current law, physicians 
are scheduled for payment reductions 
under the sustainable growth rate (SGR) 
formula for determining Medicare 
payments. Under the current law, 
physician payments were reduced by 23 
percent beginning December 1, 2010, 
and are scheduled for further reductions 
in CY 2011. Such reductions could 
cause major changes in physician 
behavior, enrollee care, and other 
Medicare provider payments, but the 
specific nature of these changes is 
exceptionally uncertain. Under a 
current law scenario, the EHR 
incentives or payment adjustments 
would exert only a minor influence on 
physician behavior relative to these very 
large payment reductions. However, the 
Congress has legislatively avoided 
physician payment reductions in each 
of the past 7 years. Behavioral changes 
resulting from these scheduled 
Medicare physician payment reductions 
are not included in our estimate and 
likewise we do not assume any 
additional behavioral changes from EHR 
incentive payments for Medicare 
physicians. 
All of these factors taken together 
make it impossible to predict with 
precision the timing or rates of adoption 
and ultimately meaningful use. 
Therefore, we show two scenarios, 
which illustrate how different scenarios 
would impact overall costs. Our ‘‘high’’ 
scenario of meaningful use 
demonstration assumes that roughly a 
decade from now, nearly 100 percent of 
hospitals and 70 percent of EPs will be 
‘‘meaningful users.’’ This estimate is 
based on the substantial economic 
incentives created by the combined 
direct and indirect factors affecting 
providers. We appreciate that in the real 
world nothing is ever 100 percent, and 
can even identify factors that would 
certainly lead providers to forego 
implementing an EHR. For example, a 
physician nearing retirement with a low 
Medicare caseload might well decide to 
accept the relatively low adverse 
consequences of declining to 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology. Alternatively, EPs, 
eligible hospitals and CAHs may choose 
not to adopt and meaningfully use EHRs 
if the total costs of purchasing certified 
EHRs and the total costs of complying 
with this rule are higher than the value

 44545 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
of the total EHR incentive payments 
(and adjustments, if applicable). 
However, we have no reliable basis for 
estimating the rate of such ‘‘holdouts.’’ 
To emphasize the uncertainties 
involved, we have also created a ‘‘low’’ 
scenario estimate for the demonstration 
of meaningful use each year, which 
assumes less robust adoption and 
meaningful use. Our ‘‘low’’ scenario of 
meaningful use demonstration assumes 
that roughly a decade from now, nearly 
95.6 percent of hospitals and 36 percent 
of EPs will be ‘‘meaningful users.’’ 
Both the high and low scenario 
estimates are based on current law, 
which includes a scheduled physician 
payment cut of 23 percent on December 
1, 2010. Such a reduction could cause 
major changes in physician behavior, 
enrollee care, and other Medicare 
provider payments, but the specific 
nature of these changes is exceptionally 
uncertain. In our estimates, we did not 
assume changes in physician behavior 
as a result of these payment cuts, as this 
reflects the standard practice used in 
forecasts of government spending 
(including effects on the private sector) 
by the Boards of Trustees for the 
Hospital Insurance and Supplementary 
Medical Insurance Trust Funds, and the 
Office of the Actuary in HHS. 
Since this RIA was published in the 
proposed rule, legislation has been 
enacted that increases the number of 
EPs that may be eligible to receive an 
incentive payment by changing the 
determination of hospital-based. A 
complete discussion of the issue, 
including comments and responses are 
available in section 2 of this rule stated. 
The determination of whether an EP is 
hospital-based will be based upon 
whether substantially all of the EP’s 
services are furnished in places of 
service classified under place of service 
codes 21 (Inpatient Hospital) or 23 
(Emergency Room, Hospital). Previously 
under the old definition, CMS estimated 
that 27 percent of EPs would meet the 
definition of hospital-based, however, 
now, under this final definition of 
hospital-based EPs, about 14 percent of 
Medicare EPs would be considered 
hospital-based and thus not eligible to 
receive any incentive payments. 
There are many estimates of current 
EHR adoption and usage rates. There is 
one EHR function—e-prescribing—for 
which adoption and usage rates for both 
physicians and hospitals may exceed 50 
percent. However, high estimates are 
misleading because they focus on 
particular elements, not on 
comprehensive systems that provide a 
full range of functions, similar in scope 
to those established in ONC’s final rule 
that adopts standards, implementation 
specifications, and certification criteria 
for the technical requirements and 
capabilities that EHR systems will need 
to meet in order to be certified. Based 
on several peer-reviewed studies, only a 
small proportion of physicians and 
hospitals have invested in EHR 
technology that encompasses such a 
broad range of functions. For example, 
a study entitled ‘‘Electronic Health 
Records in Ambulatory Care—A 
National Survey of Physicians’’ 
(Catherine DesRoches et al., New 
England Journal of Medicine, July 3, 
2008), found that in 2007 only ‘‘four 
percent of physicians reported having 
an extensive, fully functional electronic- 
records system, and 13 percent reported 
having a basic system.’’ (Additional 
results from the same survey can be 
found at the Department’s Health IT 
Adoption Initiative Web site at http://
healthit.hhs.gov/portal/server.pt?open=
512&mode=2&cached=true&objID=
1152.) Another study entitled ‘‘Use of 
Electronic Health Records in U.S. 
Hospitals’’ (Ashish Jha et al., New 
England Journal of Medicine, April 16, 
2009) found that in 2007 ‘‘only 1.5 
percent of U.S. hospitals have a 
comprehensive electronic-records 
system * * * and an additional 7.6 
percent have a basic system.’’ 
Computerized order entry (CPOE) for 
drugs was fully implemented in only 17 
percent of hospitals. 
Most physicians and hospitals have 
not yet invested in the hardware, 
software, testing and training to 
implement advanced EHRs for a number 
of reasons—lack of standards, lack of 
interoperability, limited physician 
acceptance, fear of maintenance costs, 
and lack of capital. Perhaps most 
importantly, adoption of EHR 
technology necessitates major changes 
in business processes and practices 
throughout a provider’s office or facility. 
Business process reengineering on such 
a scale is not undertaken lightly. 
However, the availability of the HITECH 
Act incentives, grants for technical 
support, more consistent use of 
standards and specified certification 
criteria, and other factors addressed in 
this RIA are likely to increase the 
adoption of EHR technology very 
substantially over the next 10 years— 
perhaps approaching complete adoption 
for physicians, hospitals, and many 
other types of providers, despite, as 
those providers have commented, not 
being included in this final rule. 
Overall, we expect spending under 
the EHR incentive program for transfer 
payments to Medicare and Medicaid 
providers over 10 years to be $9.7 
billion under the low scenario, and 
$27.4 billion under the high scenario 
(these estimates include net payment 
adjustments for Medicare providers who 
do not achieve meaningful use in 2015 
and beyond in the amount of $3.9 
billion under the high scenario and $8.1 
billion under the low scenario). We 
have also estimated ‘‘per entity’’ costs for 
EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs. We 
estimate also that adopting entities will 
achieve dollar savings at least equal to 
their total costs, and that there will be 
additional benefits to society. We 
remain persuaded after consideration of 
the public comments that 
implementation costs will be significant 
for each participating entity because 
providers who would like to qualify as 
meaningful users of EHRs will need to 
purchase certified EHR technology. We 
further acknowledge that certified EHRs 
may differ in many important respects 
from the types of EHRs noted in these 
comments and the functionalities they 
contain may differ. However, we still 
anticipate that the short-term costs to 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology will be outweighed by 
the long-term benefits, including 
practice efficiencies and improvements 
in medical outcomes. Thus it remains 
that although both cost and benefit 
estimates are highly uncertain, the RIA 
that we have prepared to the best of our 
ability presents the costs and benefits of 
the final rulemaking. 
B. Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
The Regulatory Flexibility Act 
requires agencies to prepare an Initial 
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis to 
describe and analyze the impact of the 
final rule on small entities unless the 
Secretary can certify that the regulation 
will not have a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities. In 
the healthcare sector, Small Business 
Administration size standards define a 
small entity as one with between $7 
million and $34 million in annual 
revenues. For the purposes of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act, essentially 
all non-profit organizations are 
considered small entities, regardless of 
size. Individuals and States are not 
included in the definition of a small 
entity. Since the vast majority of 
Medicare providers (well over 90 
percent) are small entities within the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act’s definitions, 
it is the normal practice of HHS simply 
to assume that all affected providers are 
‘‘small’’ under the Regulatory Flexibility 
Act. In this case, most EPs, eligible 
hospitals, and CAHs are either non- 
profit or meet the SBA’s size standard 
for small business. We also believe that 
the effects of the incentives program on 
many and probably most of these 
affected entities will be economically

srobinson on DSKHWCL6B1PROD with RULES2
 44546 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
significant. Accordingly, this RIA 
section, in conjunction with the 
remainder of the preamble, constitutes 
the required Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis. We believe that the 
adoption and meaningful use of EHRs 
will have an impact on virtually every 
EP and eligible hospital, as well as 
CAHs and some EPs and hospitals 
affiliated with MA organizations. While 
the program is voluntary, in the first 5 
years it carries substantial positive 
incentives that will make it attractive to 
virtually all eligible entities. 
Furthermore, entities that do not 
demonstrate meaningful use of EHR 
technology will be subject to significant 
Medicare payment reductions after the 
fifth year. The anticipation of these 
Medicare payment adjustments will also 
motivate EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs to adopt and meaningfully use 
certified EHR technology. 
For some EPs, CAHs and eligible 
hospitals the EHR technology that they 
have in place before the HITECH 
requirements will be able to be 
upgraded to meet the criteria for 
certified EHR technology as defined for 
this program. These costs may be 
minimal, involving no more than a 
software upgrade. ‘‘Home-grown’’ EHR 
systems that might exist may also 
require an upgrade to meet the HITECH 
certification requirements. 
We believe that most EPs using EHR 
systems will require significant changes 
to achieve certification and that EPs, 
CAHs and eligible hospitals will have to 
make process changes to achieve 
meaningful use. Further, given what we 
know about the current low levels of 
EHR adoption we believe that the 
majority of EPs will need to purchase 
certified EHR technology, implement 
this new technology, and train their staff 
on its use. The costs for implementation 
and complying with the criteria of 
meaningful use could lead to higher 
operational expenses. However, we 
believe that the combination of payment 
incentives and long-term overall gains 
in efficiency will compensate for the 
initial expenditures. 
1. Number of Small Entities 
In total, we estimate that there are 
approximately 624,000 healthcare 
organizations (EPs, eligible hospitals, or 
CAHs that will be affected by the 
incentive program. These include 
hospitals and physician practices as 
well as doctors of medicine or 
osteopathy, dental surgery or dental 
medicine, podiatric medicine, 
optometry or a chiropractor. 
Additionally, eligible nonphysicians 
(such as certified nurse-midwives, etc.) 
will be eligible to receive the Medicaid 
incentive payments. 
Of the 624,000 healthcare 
organizations we estimate will be 
affected by the incentive program, we 
estimate that 94.71 percent will be EPs, 
0.8 percent will be hospitals, and 4.47 
percent will be MAO physicians or 
hospitals. We further estimate that EPs 
will spend approximately $54,000 to 
purchase and implement a certified EHR 
and $10,000 annually for ongoing 
maintenance according to the CBO. In 
that paper, Evidence on the Costs and 
Benefits of Health Information 
Technology, May 2008, in attempting to 
estimate the total cost of implementing 
health IT systems in office-based 
medical practices, recognized the 
complicating factors of EHR types, 
available features and differences in 
characteristics of the practices that are 
adopting them. The CBO estimated a 
cost range of $25,000 to $45,000 per 
physician. For all eligible hospitals, the 
range is from $1 million to $100 million. 
Though reports vary widely, we 
anticipate that the average would be $5 
million to achieve meaningful use. We 
estimate $1 million for maintenance, 
upgrades, and training each year. See 
the Costs of EHR adoption in section a 
under Background and Assumptions 
portion of this analysis for a discussion 
regarding the costs of adoption and 
variation by size and details on our 
estimates for the number of entities that 
are eligible for the incentive within each 
eligibility type category. 
Comment: One commenter suggested 
that the Regulatory Flexibility Act 
analysis did not include an assessment 
of the cost to implement the rule at state 
and local health departments. State and 
local health departments do operate 
clinics and provide care to the public. 
Some state and local health departments 
would be considered small businesses 
under the Regulatory Flexibility Act and 
an assessment of the implementation 
costs for these entities would allow us 
to work together to identify possible 
funding sources and cost savings 
strategies. 
Response: Under Medicaid, clinics 
such as rural health clinics or FQHCs 
are not eligible providers that can 
receive incentive payments. However, 
EPs within these clinics can receive 
incentive payments if they meet all 
other eligibility requirements. The 
Federal costs and payments associated 
with EHR implementation for EPs are 
captured on in Tables 32 and 33. 
2. Alternatives Considered 
This final rule implements new 
provisions of the Act for providing 
incentives for EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs that adopt and demonstrate 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. HHS has no discretion to 
change the incentive payments or 
Medicare payment reductions specified 
in the statute for providers that adopt or 
fail to adopt EHR and achieve 
meaningful use of EHR technology. The 
only substantial alternatives within the 
discretion of the Department revolve 
around how best to meet the 
requirements of the HITECH Act 
through the definition of meaningful use 
for FY 2011 and beyond. Requirements 
that are too stringent could have the 
adverse effect of preventing many EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs from 
achieving meaningful use and thus 
preventing them from receiving an 
incentive payment. Our meaningful use 
requirements for 2011 are designed to 
encourage more widespread adoption of 
certified EHR technology and allow 
more EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs 
to qualify for incentives while they are 
also adjusting their practice patterns 
and training staff to operate the EHR 
technology in preparation for more 
stringent meaningful use requirements 
over time. We recognize that there may 
be incremental costs that result from 
requiring additional functionality over 
the base level defined in the HITECH 
Act. We note that with regard to 
reporting of clinical quality measures 
for purposes of demonstrating 
meaningful use, we initially considered 
requiring EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs to report quality measures 
electronically in the initial year of the 
program; however, ultimately we 
determined that many providers would 
not be able to comply with a 
requirement to report all quality 
measures at the beginning of the 
program. The alternative approach, 
consistent with the requirements of this 
final rule, is to require reporting of 
quality measures in phases. In 2011, 
there will be a requirement to report 
clinical quality measures through 
attestation with a numerator, 
denominator, and exclusions. Electronic 
clinical quality measure reporting will 
begin in FY 2012 for hospitals and CY 
2012 for EPs. We expect that additional 
clinical quality measure reporting will 
be added in later years. 
Under Medicaid, we considered 
numerous alternatives regarding how to 
demonstrate eligibility for the incentive 
payments as well as adoption and 
meaningful use of the certified EHR 
technology. These alternatives, 
including the time period for 
demonstrating adequate patient volume, 
and the requirements and methods for 
demonstrating meaningful use are

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
discussed in section II.D. of this final 
rule. 
3. Conclusion 
As discussed later in this analysis, we 
believe that there are many positive 
effects of adopting EHR on health care 
providers, quite apart from the incentive 
payments to be provided under this 
rule. While economically significant, we 
do not believe that the net effect on 
individual providers will be negative 
over time except in very rare cases. (The 
statute provides for hardship exemption 
in such cases.) Accordingly, we believe 
that the object of the Regulatory 
Flexibility Act to minimize burden on 
small entities are met by this rule as 
final. 
Comment: Commenters cited the 
variation in the costs of EHR adoption 
across EP settings. For example, smaller 
practices believe their costs of EHR 
adoption to be higher per physician 
than larger counterparts. They believe 
they cannot realize the staff reductions 
and related cost savings from EHR 
adoption due to greater cross- 
functionality for their staff. 
Response: We acknowledge the 
different experiences EPs have with 
EHR adoption and implementation. Two 
additional studies relating to the costs of 
adoption among small practices (Miller 
et al. (2005) ‘‘The Value Of Electronic 
Health Records In Solo Or Small Group 
Practices’’ Health Affairs 24(5): 1127– 
1137, and Zaroukian and Sierra (2006) 
‘‘Benefiting from Ambulatory EHR 
Implementation: Solidarity, Six Sigma, 
and Willingness to Strive’’ The Journal 
of Healthcare Information Management 
20(1): 53–60) estimate the cost per 
physician to be $44,000 per year with 
roughly $8,500 to $13,000 in ongoing 
maintenance. However, even among 
these studies there was still variation in 
experience. The per provider design of 
meaningful use incentive payments and 
orientation of other government health 
IT grant programs is to facilitate 
adoption and positive return on 
investment across health care settings. 
Thus we continue to hold that our cost 
estimates are reasonable estimations of 
provider experience while 
acknowledging that variations in 
experiences will be inevitable. 
C. Small Rural Hospitals 
Section 1102(b) of the Act requires us 
to prepare a RIA if a rule would have 
a significant impact on the operations of 
a substantial number of small rural 
hospitals. This analysis must conform to 
the provisions of section 604 of the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act. For purposes 
of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define 
a small rural hospital as a hospital that 
is located outside of a metropolitan 
statistical area and has fewer than 100 
beds. This final rule would affect the 
operations of a substantial number of 
small rural hospitals because they are 
required to adopt certified EHR 
technology by 2015, or face adjusted 
Medicare payments. As stated above, we 
have determined that this final rule 
would create a significant impact on a 
substantial number of small entities, 
and have prepared a Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis as required by the 
Regulatory Flexibility Act and, for small 
rural hospitals, section 1102(b) of the 
Act. Furthermore, any impacts that 
would arise from the implementation of 
certified EHR technology in a rural 
eligible hospital would be positive, with 
respect to the streamlining of care and 
the ease of sharing information with 
other EPs to avoid delays, duplication, 
or errors. 
Comment: Several commenters have 
disagreed with our assessment, noting 
that the unique circumstances of small 
rural hospitals will not lead to 
efficiency and lower costs as it might 
with urban hospitals, but would lead to 
increased costs related to loss of 
productivity among the staff for 
implementing and learning an EHR 
system, and in later years, Medicare 
payment adjustments because of the 
lack of broadband access in these areas 
among other reasons. 
Response: Although we agree that 
small rural hospitals will have 
challenges inherent in their location, 
size and staffing complexity, we also 
acknowledge that smaller, more rural 
hospitals could experience added 
burden in achieving meaningful use. 
Supplemental funding to Regional 
Extension Centers to assist CAHs will 
work to lessen disparity between urban 
and rural hospitals. We also believe that 
the presence of incentive payments, 
market demands and rewards for data 
exchange, and future cost savings 
resulting from meaningful use will 
increase hospital adoption and 
meaningful use of EHRs. 
D. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act 
Section 202 of the Unfunded 
Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) 
requires that agencies assess anticipated 
costs and benefits before issuing any 
rule whose mandates would require 
spending in any 1 year $100 million in 
1995 dollars, updated annually for 
inflation. In 2010, that threshold is 
approximately $135 million. UMRA 
does not address the total cost of a rule. 
Rather, it focuses on certain categories 
of cost, mainly those ‘‘Federal mandate’’ 
costs resulting from—(1) imposing 
enforceable duties on State, local, or 
tribal governments, or on the private 
sector, or (2) increasing the stringency of 
conditions in, or decreasing the funding 
of, State, local, or tribal governments 
under entitlement programs. 
This rule imposes no substantial 
mandates on States. This program is 
voluntary for States and States offer the 
incentives at their option. The State role 
in the incentive program is essentially 
to administer the Medicaid incentive 
program. While this entails certain 
procedural responsibilities, these do not 
involve substantial State expense. In 
general, each State Medicaid Agency 
that participates in the incentive 
program will be required to invest in 
systems and technology to comply— 
States will have to identify and educate 
providers, evaluate their attestations 
and pay the incentive. However, the 
Federal government will fund 90 
percent of the State’s related 
administrative costs, providing controls 
on the total State outlay. 
The investments needed to meet the 
meaningful use standards and obtain 
incentive funding are voluntary, and 
hence not ‘‘mandates’’within the 
meaning of the statute. However, the 
potential reductions in Medicare 
reimbursement after FY 2015 are 
effectively mandates. We note that we 
have no discretion as to those potential 
payment reductions. Private sector EPs 
that voluntarily choose not to 
participate in the program may 
anticipate potential costs in the 
aggregate that may exceed $135 million; 
however, because EPs may choose for 
various reasons not to participate in the 
program, we do not have firm data for 
the percentage of participation within 
the private sector. 
This RIA, taken together with the 
remainder of the preamble, constitutes 
the analysis required by UMRA. 
E. Federalism 
Executive Order 13132 establishes 
certain requirements that an agency 
must meet when it promulgates a final 
rule that imposes substantial direct 
requirement costs on State and local 
governments, preempts State law, or 
otherwise has Federalism implications. 
This final rule would not have a 
substantial direct effect on State or local 
governments, preempt State law, or 
otherwise have a Federalism 
implication. Importantly, State 
Medicaid agencies are receiving 100 
percent match from the Federal 
government for incentives paid and a 90 
percent match for expenses associated 
with administering the program. As 
previously stated, we believe that State 
administrative costs are minimal. We 
note that this final rule does add a new

business requirement for States, because 
of the systems that will need to be 
implemented to track and report on 
provider attestations, applications, and 
payments. States will also expend funds 
on the systems that must be built to 
conduct the tracking and reporting 
activities. States will interface with the 
NLR since registration of providers will 
be stored in the NLR. For tracking and 
making payments, we believe that most 
States will use their current MMIS 
system to make payments. States must 
inform us of their plans for payments, 
systems, etc, via the SMHP, PAPD and 
IAPD; additionally, States will indicate 
the costs associated with these activities 
in their PAPD and IAPD. CMS is 
providing 90 percent FFP to States for 
building the interface and/or for updates 
to the MMIS related to EHR incentive 
payment administration. We believe the 
Federal share of the 90 percent match 
will protect the States from burdensome 
financial outlays and, as noted above, 
States offer the Medicaid EHR incentive 
program at their option. 
F. Anticipated Effects 
The objective of the remainder of this 
RIA is to summarize the costs and 
benefits of the HITECH incentive 
program for the Medicare FFS, 
Medicaid, and Medicare Advantage 
(MA) programs. We also provide 
assumptions and a narrative addressing 
the potential costs to the industry for 
implementation of this technology. 
G. HITECH Impact Analysis 
1. Need for Regulation 
This final rule would implement the 
provisions of the American Recovery 
and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) 
(Pub. L. 111–5) that provide incentive 
payments to EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs participating in Medicare and 
Medicaid programs that adopt and 
meaningfully use certified EHR 
technology. The final rule specifies the 
initial criteria that an EP, eligible 
hospital, or CAH must meet in order to 
qualify for the incentive payment; 
calculation of the incentive payment 
amounts; payment adjustments under 
Medicare for covered professional 
services and inpatient hospital services 
provided by EPs, and eligible hospitals 
failing to meaningfully use certified 
EHR technology; and other program 
participation requirements. As noted 
earlier in this RIA, changes both in 
legislation and policy based on 
comments from the public have been 
taken into account for the preparation of 
this final impact analysis. 
2. Alternatives Considered 
As previously discussed in the 
alternatives section of the regulatory 
flexibility analysis, HHS has no 
discretion to change the incentive 
payments or payment reductions 
specified in the statute for providers 
that adopt or fail to adopt EHR and 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology. However, we have 
discretion around how best to meet the 
HITECH Act requirements for 
meaningful use for FY 2011 and beyond, 
which we have exercised in this final 
rule. Additionally, we have used our 
discretion to appropriately time the 
registration, attestation and payment 
requirements to allow EPs and eligible 
organizations as much time as possible 
in coordination with the anticipated 
certification of EHR technology to 
obtain and meaningfully use certified 
EHRs. We recognize that there may be 
additional costs that result from various 
discretionary policy choices such as 
requiring additional functionality over 
the base level defined in the HITECH 
Act, however, those costs cannot be 
estimated and are not captured in this 
analysis. 
3. Background and Assumptions 
The principal costs of this final rule 
are the additional expenditures that will 
be undertaken by eligible entities in 
order to obtain the Medicare and 
Medicaid incentive payments to adopt, 
implement or upgrade and/or 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology, and to avoid the 
Medicare payment adjustments that will 
ensue if they fail to do so. The estimates 
for the provisions affecting Medicare 
and Medicaid EPs, eligible hospitals, 
and CAHs are somewhat uncertain for 
several reasons: (1) The program is 
voluntary although payment 
adjustments will be imposed on 
Medicare providers who are unable to 
demonstrate meaningful use starting in 
2015; (2) the criteria for the 
demonstration of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology has been 
finalized for stage one but will change 
over time; (3) the HHS certification 
process although defined, has yet to be 
implemented;, and, (4) the impact of the 
financial incentives and payment 
adjustments on the rate of adoption of 
certified EHR technology by EPs, 
eligible hospitals, and CAHs is difficult 
to predict. The net costs and savings 
shown for this program represent two 
possible scenarios and actual impacts 
could differ substantially. 
As written in the preamble, this final 
rule describes the incentive payments 
for EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs for 
adopting and demonstrating meaningful 
use of certified EHR technology. This 
impact analysis addresses the costs and 
benefits to the Medicare and Medicaid 
programs, as well as general 
implementation costs for eligible 
hospitals, CAHs and EPs. 
Detailed information about the 
incentive program, the specific payment 
amounts and how those payments will 
be paid, is provided in section II of this 
final rule. Based on input from a 
number of internal and external sources, 
including the Government 
Accountability Office (GAO) and CBO, 
we calculated the numbers of EPs and 
eligible hospitals, including CAHs 
under Medicare, Medicaid, and MA and 
used them throughout the analysis. 
• About 553,200 Medicare FFS EPs in 
2011 (some of which will also be 
Medicaid EPs). 
• About 14 percent of the total EPs 
are hospital-based Medicare EPs, and 
are not eligible for the program. This 
leaves approximately 477,500 
nonhospital-based Medicare EPs in 
2011. 
• Twenty percent of the nonhospital- 
based Medicare EPs (approximately 
95,500 Medicare EPs in 2011) are also 
eligible for Medicaid (meet the 30 
percent Medicaid patient volume 
criteria), but can only be paid under one 
program. We assume that any EP in this 
situation will choose to receive the 
Medicaid incentive payment, because it 
is larger. 
• About 44,100 non-Medicare eligible 
EPs (such as dentists, pediatricians, and 
eligible non-physicians such as certified 
nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners and 
physicians assistants) will be eligible to 
receive the Medicaid incentive 
payments. 
• 5,011 eligible hospitals comprised 
of the following: 
++ 3,620 acute care hospitals. 
++ 1,302 CAHs 
++ 78 children’s hospitals (Medicaid 
only). 
++ 11 cancer hospitals (Medicaid 
only). 
• All eligible hospitals, except for 
children’s and cancer hospitals, may 
qualify and apply for both Medicare and 
Medicaid incentive payments. 
• 12 MA Organizations (about 28,000 
EPs, and 29 hospitals) would be eligible 
for incentive payments. 
• Payments can begin as early as third 
quarter FY 2011. 
4. Industry Costs and Adoption Rates 
To estimate the impact on healthcare 
providers we used information from 
four studies cited previously. Based on 
these studies, we continue to estimate 
for EPs, the average adopt/implement/

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
upgrade cost is $54,000 per physician 
FTE, while annual maintenance costs 
average $10,000 per physician FTE. 
For all eligible hospitals, the range is 
from $1 million to $100 million. 
Although reports vary widely, we 
anticipate that the average would be $5 
million to achieve meaningful use, 
because providers who would like to 
qualify as meaningful users of EHRs will 
need to purchase certified EHRs. We 
further acknowledge that ‘‘certified 
EHRs’’ may differ in many important 
respects from the EHRs currently in use 
and may differ in the functionalities 
they contain. We estimate $1 million for 
maintenance, upgrades, and training 
each year. Industry costs are important, 
in part, because EHR adoption rates will 
be a function of these industry costs and 
the extent to which the costs of 
‘‘certified EHRs’’ are higher than the total 
value of EHR incentive payments 
available to EPs and eligible hospitals 
(as well as adjustments, in the case of 
the Medicare EHR incentive program) 
and any perceived benefits including 
societal benefits. Because of the 
uncertainties surrounding industry cost 
estimates, we have made various 
assumptions about adoption rates in the 
following analysis in order to estimate 
the budgetary impact on the Medicare 
and Medicaid programs. 
For an eligible Medicaid EP, the first 
year incentive can be based on 
adoption, implementation, and upgrade 
costs. Previously, we noted that section 
1903(t)(4)(C) of the Act gives the 
Secretary the authority to determine 
average allowable costs for certified 
EHR technology. The Secretary studied 
average costs associated with the 
purchase, initial implementation, and 
upgrade of certified EHR technology, 
including support services and initial 
training. 
Sections 1903(t)(1)(A) and 1903(t)(4) 
of the Act specify that EPs may not 
receive incentive payments in excess of 
85 percent of the net average allowable 
costs of certified EHR technology, with 
such net average allowable costs capped 
at $25,000 in the first year (and $10,000 
in each of the subsequent years). 
a. Costs of EHR Adoption for EPs 
Previously, we described four studies 
used to estimate costs of 
implementation including the purchase 
and installation of hardware and 
software, training, as well as 
productivity losses associated with 
implementation and training. Each of 
these studies was conducted several 
years ago, and did not control for type 
of EHR, functionality, physician 
practice type or size. Furthermore, EHRs 
were not being built against any 
particular consensus standard, nor was 
the concept of ‘‘meaningful use’’ a factor. 
Thus, the cost of implementing and 
maintaining certified EHR technology 
which meets the requirements 
established in this regulation might 
exceed the estimates from these studies. 
One average estimate of the cost per 
physician for implementation is around 
$35,000. A similar study of community 
health centers estimated costs to average 
$54,000 per physician FTE. In this 
study, the authors explained that 
implementation costs varied between 
entities for hardware, software, 
installation, and training. After 
implementation, there were ongoing 
operating costs estimated at $21,000 per 
year for a practice of four physicians. 
The CBO paper, Evidence on the Costs 
and Benefits of Health Information 
Technology, May 2008, in attempting to 
estimate the total cost of implementing 
health IT systems in office-based 
medical practices, recognized the 
complicating factors of EHR types, 
available features and differences in 
characteristics of the practices that are 
adopting them. The CBO estimated a 
cost range of $25,000 to $45,000 per 
physician. In the CBO study, operating 
costs added $3,000 to $9,000 per 
physician per year. Finally, a 2005 
paper from AHRQ stated that the 
average purchase and implementation 
cost of an EHR could be $32,606 per 
FTE physician. Maintenance costs were 
an additional $1,500 per physician, per 
month, or $18,000 per year. Smaller 
practices had the highest 
implementation costs per physician at 
$37,204. Based on the studies cited, 
eligible providers will be eligible to 
receive the maximum incentive 
permitted under the statute, because the 
implementation and maintenance costs 
we have estimated exceed the caps for 
net average allowable costs set in the 
statute. 
In calculating the impact of the EHR 
incentive program for Medicaid EPs, we 
assumed that approximately 20 percent 
of the EPs eligible for the Medicare 
incentive payment program are also 
eligible for Medicaid EHR incentive 
payments (about 95,500 in 2011). Since 
the Medicaid incentive payments are 
higher than those for Medicare and EPs 
can only receive payments from one 
program, we assume the dually eligible 
EPs will receive their payments through 
the Medicaid program. It is also 
important to note that just as there is 
overall variation in state Medicaid 
programs, we anticipate there will be 
variation in the design and timing of 
state Medicaid EHR incentive programs. 
New data on the pace of state planning 
for meaningful use was used to adjust 
Medicaid adoption scenarios. Thus, 
how and when providers apply for 
meaningful use through Medicaid will 
likely differ by state. Medicaid also 
offers incentive payments for dentists, 
certified nurse-midwives, nurse 
practitioners and certain physicians’ 
assistants. While minimal, we have 
incorporated the sum of these groups in 
Table 51. We have estimated a range of 
Medicaid EPs that will be meaningful 
users each calendar year. The last line 
represents the range of predicted 
meaningful EHR users each calendar 
year. The Medicaid penetration rate for 
EPs is consistent with the analysis that 
was used for the Medicare EPs, but 
without the behavioral limitations 
imposed by the Medicare current statute 
SGR payment reductions. We assumed a 
modest behavioral response by 
Medicaid EPs to the Medicaid incentive 
payments resulting in an increase over 
baseline participation. 
b. Costs of EHR Adoption for Eligible 
Hospitals 
The American Hospital Association 
(AHA) conducts annual surveys that 
among other measures, track hospital 
spending. We have updated these data 
to reflect the latest figures from the 2008 
AHA Survey. Costs at these levels of 
adoption were significantly higher in 
2008 than 2007. This may better reflect 
the costs of implementing additional 
functionalities. We have also updated 
the number of discharges using the most 
recent cost report data available. The 
range in yearly information technology 
spending among hospitals is large— 
from $36,000 to over $32 million based 
on 2007 and 2008 AHA data. EHR 
system costs specifically were reported 
by experts to run as high as $20 million 
to $100 million; HHS discussions with 
experts led to cost ranges for adoption 
that varied by hospital size and level of 
EHR system sophistication. Research to 
date has shown that adoption of 
comprehensive EHR systems is limited. 
In the aforementioned AHA study, 1.5 
percent of these organizations had 
comprehensive systems, which were 
defined as hospital-wide clinical 
documentation of cases, test results, 
prescription and test ordering, plus 
support for decision-making that 
included treatment guidelines. Some 
10.9 percent have a basic system that 
does not include physician and nursing 
notes, and can only be used in one area 
of the hospital. Applying a similar 
standard to the 2008 AHA data results 
in roughly 3–4 percent of hospitals 
having comprehensive systems and 12 
to 13 percent having basic systems. 
According to hospital CEOs, the main 
barrier to adoption is the cost of the

systems, and the lack of capital. 
Hospitals have been concerned that they 
will not be able to recoup their 
investment, and they are already 
operating on the smallest of margins. 
Because uptake of advanced systems is 
low, it is difficult to get a solid average 
estimate for implementation and 
maintenance costs that can be applied 
across the industry. In addition, we 
recognize that there are additional 
industry costs associated with adoption 
and implementation of EHR technology 
that are not captured in our estimates 
that eligible entities will incur. Because 
the impact of those activities, such as 
reduced staff productivity related to 
learning how to use the EHR 
technology, the need to add additional 
staff to work with HIT issues, 
administrative costs related to reporting, 
and the like are unknown at this time 
and difficult to quantify. 
5. Medicare Incentive Program Costs 
a. Medicare Eligible Professionals (EPs) 
In the proposed rule, CMS said that 
an EP would be a hospital-based EP and 
therefore ineligible to receive a 
Medicare or Medicaid EHR incentive 
payment if more than 90 percent of their 
services are provided in the following 
place of service (POS) codes for HIPAA 
standard transactions: 21—Inpatient 
Hospital, 22—Outpatient Hospital, 23— 
Emergency Room. 
However, as previously noted here 
and discussed elsewhere in this final 
rule, Congress amended the law to 
include only POS codes 21 (inpatient) 
and 23 (emergency room), excluding 22 
(outpatient hospital), thereby permitting 
some hospital-based EPs to qualify for 
the incentive payment. Accordingly we 
have updated our tables to reflect the 
increased number of EPs that may now 
qualify for the incentive payments, and 
those revisions to the numbers flow 
throughout these updated tables. 
To determine the estimated costs of 
the Medicare incentives for EPs we first 
needed to determine the EPs with 
Medicare claims. Then, we calculated 
that about 14 percent of those EPs are 
hospital-based, based on the definition 
final in § 495.4, and therefore, do not 
qualify for incentive payments. This 
percentage of EPs were subtracted from 
the total number of EPs who have 
claims with Medicare. These numbers 
were tabulated from Medicare claims 
data. 
We have also estimated that about 20 
percent of EPs that are not hospital- 
based will qualify for Medicaid 
incentive payments and will choose that 
program because the payments are 
higher. Of the remaining EPs, we have 
estimated the percentage which will be 
meaningful users each calendar year. As 
discussed previously our estimates for 
the number of EPs that will successfully 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology is uncertain, so we 
established high and low scenarios to 
account for high and low rates of 
demonstration of meaningful use. 
The percentage of Medicare EPs who 
will satisfy the criteria for 
demonstrating meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology and will 
qualify for incentive payments is a key, 
but a highly uncertain factor. Our 
Medicare EHR adoption assumptions for 
EPs are also affected by the current 
situation with Medicare physician fee 
schedule payment rates. As noted 
previously, under current law (that is, 
the SGR system formulas), physician 
payments will be reduced by 21.3 
percent beginning June 1, 2010, and are 
scheduled to be further reduced 
beginning in CY 2011. Such reductions 
would almost certainly cause major 
changes in physician behavior, enrollee 
care, and other Medicare provider 
payments, but the specific nature of 
these changes is exceptionally 
uncertain. Under a current law scenario, 
the EHR incentives or Medicare 
payment adjustments would exert only 
a minor influence on physician behavior 
relative to these very large payment 
reductions. Behavioral changes resulting 
from these scheduled payment 
reductions are not included in our 
estimate and likewise do not assume 
any additional behavioral changes from 
EHR incentive payments. Accordingly, 
the estimated number of non-hospital 
based Medicare EPs, (including those 
additional EPs who may now qualify 
under the revised definition), who will 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology over the period CYs 
2011 through 2019 is as shown in Table 
22.

 44551 
Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Under the HITECH Act, EPs can 
receive up to 5 years of Medicare 
incentive payments for the 
demonstration of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. These 
payments are the lesser of 75 percent of 
the physician’s allowed charges for the 
year or a specified maximum amount, 
which declines from a possible $18,000 
incentive payment for the first payment 
year (2011 or 2012) to a $2,000 incentive 
payment for the fifth payment year. EPs 
in HPSAs receive incentives that are 10 
percent higher than the maximum 
amounts. Hospital-based EPs are not 
eligible for the Medicare EP incentive 
payments. EPs may choose to receive 
incentive payments from either 
Medicare or Medicaid, (with some 
limitations on switching programs) but 
not from both. 
The standard full amount of Medicaid 
incentive payments that an EP could 
receive is larger than the standard full 
amount for the Medicare EP incentive 
payments: of $63,750 versus $44,000 for 
Medicare. Medicare incentive payments 
can first be paid to EPs in CY 2011; and 
2012 is the last year that an EP can start 
to receive incentives and obtain the full 
5 years of payments. EPs who first 
qualify in CY 2013 would be limited to 
an incentive of $15,000 for the first year, 
and may be eligible to receive 4 years 
of incentive payments. EPs who first 
qualify in CY 2014 would be limited to 
an incentive of $12,000 for the first year 
and may be eligible to receive 3 years 
of incentive payments. For the Medicare 
program, incentives are not payable 
after CY 2016, and EPs who first 
demonstrate meaningful use in CY 2015 
or later are not eligible for EHR 
incentive payments. 
Medicare payment adjustments will 
apply in CY 2015 and later to EPs who 
cannot demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology, regardless of 
whether they received an EHR incentive 
payment or not. Specifically, the 
Medicare Physician Fee Schedule 
payments for an EP who cannot 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology would be reduced by 1 
percentage point in CY 2015, two 
percentage points in CY 2016, and 3 
percentage points in CY 2017, and 
between 3 and 5 percentage points 
starting in CY 2018. The HITECH Act 
gives the Secretary the authority, 
beginning in CY 2018, to increase these 
reductions by 1 percentage point each 
year, but not more than 5 percentage 
points overall, if the Secretary finds the 
proportion of EPs who are meaningful 
EHR users is less than 75 percent. 
Each year a transfer will be made 
between the general fund of the 
Treasury and the Part B account of the 
Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) 
trust fund to offset the incentives paid 
or payment adjustments made during 
the year. In this way, the Part B 
beneficiary premium will not be 
affected by the EP payment incentives. 
We estimate that there are 12 MA 
organizations that might be eligible to 
participate in the EHR incentive 
program. Those plans have about 28,000 
EPs. 
Our estimates of the incentive 
payment costs and payment adjustment 
savings reflect our assumptions about 
the proportion of EPs who will 
demonstrate meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology. These assumptions 
were developed based on a review of 
recent studies and discussions with 
subject matter experts. We project that 
a growing proportion of EPs will adopt 
certified EHR technology that meets the 
standards even in the absence of the 
legislated incentives. This number 
could be higher or lower depending on 
the final meaningful use definition 
adopted, physicians’ access to capital 
and implementation expertise, the 
success of the other HITECH programs 
in reaching physicians, and other 
factors. 
Specifically, our assumptions are 
based on literature estimating current 
rates of physician EHR adoption and 
rates of diffusion of EHRs and similar 
technologies. There are a number of 
studies that have attempted to measure 
the rate of adoption of electronic 
medical records (EMR) among 
physicians prior to the enactment of the 
HITECH Act (see, for example, Funky 
and Taylor (2005) The State and Pattern 
of Health Information Technology 
Adoption. RAND Monograph MG–409. 
Santa Monica: The RAND Corporation; 
Ford, E.W., Menachemi, N., Peterson, 
L.T., Huerta, T.R. (2009) ‘‘Resistance is 
Futile: But it is Slowing the Pace of EHR 
Adoption Nonetheless’’ Journal of the 
American Informatics Association 16(3): 
274–281). We started with the estimated 
rate of EHR adoption from the study 
with the most rigorous definition, but 
note that the meaningful criteria are not 
equivalent to a fully functional system 
as defined in this study. (DesRoches, 
CM, Campbell, EG, Rao, SR et al. (2008) 
‘‘Electronic Health Records in 
Ambulatory Care—A National Survey of 
Physicians’’ New England Journal of 
Medicine 359(1): 50–60). For the low 
scenario, we then inflated that number 
(4 percent) to a 2011 baseline using the 
numbers of physicians reporting in that 
survey that they had EHR 
implementation underway. We assumed 
that the same proportion of them would 
be implementing fully-functional EHRs 
as in the baseline (30 percent of those 
with basic systems.) We then trended 
this number forward using the trajectory 
mapped out by Ford et al. using the data 
from the period prior to FY 2004 since 
the slower rate of adoption during the 
FY 2005 through 2007 period was 
thought to be caused by policy 
uncertainty which this regulation 
should resolve. 
Given the revisions to the meaningful 
use criteria in this final rule and the 
nationwide implementation of the 
Regional Extension Center Program, the 
likelihood of reaching the high scenario 
has increased. However, actual adoption 
trends could be significantly different 
from these assumptions, given the 
elements of uncertainty we describe 
throughout this analysis. 
Net costs for the low scenario of the 
Medicare EP portion of the HITECH Act 
are shown in Table 23.

b. Medicare Eligible Hospitals and 
CAHs 
In brief, the estimates of hospital 
adoption were developed by calculating 
projected incentive payments (which 
are driven by discharges), comparing 
them to projected costs of attaining 
meaningful use, and then making 
assumptions about how rapidly 
hospitals would adopt given the fraction 
of their costs that were covered. In 
addition, our estimates have been 
updated to reflect that the additional 
challenges likely to be experienced in 
the adoption of EHRs among CAHs will 
be partially ameliorated by supplements 
to Regional Extension Center funding to 
assist CAHs with EHR adoption. 
Specifically, the first step in preparing 
estimates of Medicare program costs for 
eligible hospitals was to determine the 
amount of Medicare incentive payments 
that each hospital in the country could 
potentially receive under the statutory 
formula, based on its admission 
numbers (total patients and Medicare 
patients). The total incentive payments 
potentially payable over a 4-year period 
vary significantly by hospitals’ inpatient 
caseloads, ranging from a low of about 
$11,000 to a high of $12.9 million, with 
the median being $3.8 million. The 
potential Medicare incentive payments 
for each eligible hospital were compared 
with the hospital’s expected cost of 
purchasing and operating certified EHR 
technology. Costs of adoption for each 
hospital were estimated using data from 
the 2008 AHA annual survey and IT 
supplement. Estimated costs varied by 
size of hospital and by the likely status 
of EHR adoption in that class of 
hospitals. Hospitals were grouped first 
by size (CAHs, non-CAH hospitals 
under 400 beds, and hospitals with 400 
or more beds) because EHR adoption 
costs do vary by size: namely, larger 
hospitals with more diverse service 
offerings and powerful physician staffs 
generally implement more customized 
systems than smaller hospitals that 
might purchase off-the-shelf products. 
We then calculated the proportion of 
hospitals within each class that were at 
one of three levels of EHR adoption: (1) 
Hospitals which had already 
implemented relatively advanced 
systems that included CPOE systems for 
medications; (2) hospitals which had 
implemented more basic systems 
through which lab results could be 
shared, but not CPOE for medications; 
and (3) hospitals starting from a base 
level either neither CPOE or lab 
reporting. The CPOE for medication 
standard was chosen because expert 
input indicated that the CPOE standard 
in the final meaningful use definition 
will be the hardest one for hospitals to 
meet. Table 25 provides these 
proportions. 
We then calculated the costs of 
moving from these stages to meaningful 
use for each class of hospital, assuming 
that even for hospitals with CPOE 
systems they would incur additional 
costs of at least 10 percent of their IT 
budgets. These costs were based on 
cross-sectional data from the AHA 
survey and thus do not likely represent 
the true costs of implementing systems. 
We have updated these data to reflect 
the latest figures from the 2008 AHA 
Survey. Costs at these levels of adoption 
were significantly higher in 2008 than 
2007. This may better reflect the costs 
of implementing additional 
functionalities. We have also updated 
the number of discharges using the most 
recent cost report data available. Under 
the HITECH Act, an eligible hospital can 
receive up to 4 years of Medicare 
incentive payments for the 
demonstration of meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. These 
payments reflect the ratio of Medicare 
inpatient days to total inpatient days 
and are adjusted by transition factors of 
100, 75, 50, and 25 percent for the first 
through fourth implementation years 
respectively. [Medicare incentive 
payments can first be paid to hospitals 
in FY 2011, and FY 2013 is the last year 
that a hospital can start to receive 
incentives and obtain the full 4-year 
transition rates.] Eligible hospitals that 
first qualify in FY 2014 or FY 2015 will 
only receive the transition portions that 
apply to eligible hospitals who 
implement their EHR in FY 2013 (for 
example, 75 percent in FY 2014 and 50 
percent in FY 2015). Eligible hospitals 
first demonstrating meaningful use in 
FY 2016 or later are not eligible for 
incentive payments. Medicare payment 
adjustments will be applied beginning 
in FY 2015 to eligible hospitals that 
cannot demonstrate meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology. Special rules 
apply to CAHs. 
We estimate that there are 12 MAOs 
that might be eligible to participate in 
the incentive program. Those plans have 
29 eligible hospitals. The costs for the 
MA program have been included in the 
overall Medicare estimates. 
Again to illustrate the uncertainty, we 
are providing two scenarios for our 
estimates. Our high scenario estimated 
net costs for section 4102 of the HITECH 
Act are shown in Table 26: Estimated 
costs (+) and savings (¥) for eligible 
hospitals adopting certified EHRs. This 
provision is estimated to increase 
Medicare hospital expenditures by a net 
total of $10.1 billion during FYs -2011 
through 2019.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Based on the comparison of Medicare 
incentive payments and 
implementation/operating costs for each 
eligible hospital, (described above), we 
made the assumptions shown in Table 
28, related to the prevalence of certified 
EHR technology for FY 2011 through 
2018. As indicated, eligible hospitals 
that could cover the full cost of an EHR 
system through Medicare incentive 
payments were assumed to implement 
them relatively rapidly, and vice-versa. 
In other words, eligible hospitals will 
have an incentive to purchase and 
implement an EHR system if they 
perceive that a large portion of the costs 
will be covered by the incentive 
payments. Table 28 shows the high 
scenario estimates: 
For instance, under the high scenario 
50 percent of eligible hospitals whose 
incentive payments would cover 
between 75 percent and 100 percent of 
the cost of a certified EHR system were 
assumed to have a certified system in 
FY 2011. In FY 2012, 65 percent of 
those hospitals were assumed to have a 
certified EHR system. All such hospitals 
were assumed to have a certified EHR 
system in FY 2015 and thereafter. 
High rates of EHR adoption are 
anticipated prior to FY 2015 due to the 
large payment adjustments that will be 
imposed on eligible hospitals that are 
unable to demonstrate meaningful use 
beginning in FY 2015. Specifically, the 
Medicare ‘‘market basket’’ payment 
updates would be reduced (on a 
noncumulative basis) by one-fourth, 
one-half, and three-fourths for FYs 2015, 
2016, and 2017 and later, respectively, 
for eligible hospitals that were not 
meaningful users of certified EHR 
technology. However, we heard from 
industry experts that issues surrounding 
the capacity of vendors and expert 
consultants to support implementation, 
issues of access to capital, and 
competing priorities in responding to 
payer demand will limit the number of 
hospitals that can adopt advanced 
systems in the short-term. Therefore, we 
cannot be certain of the adoption rate 
for hospitals due to these factors and 
others previously outlined in this 
preamble, and so we provide two 
scenarios which are examples of what 
we believe are possible low rates and 
high rates of adoption. 
Table 29 shows the low scenario 
estimates.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
For large, organized facilities such as 
hospitals, we believe that the revenue 
losses caused by these payment 
adjustments would be a substantial 
incentive to adopt certified EHR 
technology, even in instances where the 
Medicare incentive payments would 
cover only a portion of the costs of 
purchasing, installing, populating, and 
operating the EHR system. Based on the 
assumptions about incentive payments 
as percentages of EHR technology costs 
in Table 29, we estimated that the great 
majority of eligible hospitals would 
qualify for at least a portion of the 
Medicare incentive payments that they 
could potentially receive, and only a 
modest number would incur penalties. 
Nearly all eligible hospitals are 
projected to have implemented certified 
EHR technology by FY 2019. Table 30 
shows our high scenario estimated 
percentages of the total potential 
incentive payments associated with 
eligible hospitals that could 
demonstrate meaningful use of EHR 
systems. Also shown are the estimated 
percentages of potential incentives that 
would actually be paid each year. 
For instance in FY 2012 under the 
high scenario, 53.5 percent of the total 
amount of incentive payments which 
could be payable in that year would be 
for eligible hospitals who have 
demonstrated meaningful use of 
certified EHR technology and therefore 
will be paid. In FY 2015 under the high 
scenario, 92.6 percent of the total 
amount of incentive payments which 
could be payable will be for hospitals 
who have certified EHR systems, but 
some of those eligible hospitals would 
have already received 4 years of 
incentive payments, and therefore 54.2 
percent of all possible incentive 
payments actually paid in that year. 
Table 31 shows the low scenario 
estimates. 
The estimated payments to eligible 
hospitals were calculated based on the 
hospitals’ qualifying status and 
individual incentive amounts under the 
statutory formula. Similarly, the 
estimated penalties for nonqualifying 
hospitals were based on the market 
basket reductions and Medicare 
revenues. The estimated savings in 
Medicare eligible hospital benefit 
expenditures resulting from the use of 
hospital certified EHR systems are

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
discussed under ‘‘general 
considerations’’ at the end of this 
section. We assumed no future growth 
in the total number of hospitals in the 
U.S. because growth in acute care 
hospitals has been minimal in recent 
years. 
Comment: The AHA surveyed 795 
hospitals in January 2010 asking 
whether their EHR systems could meet 
each of the meaningful use objectives 
now and in coming years: 45 percent 
reported they could meet all Stage 1 
objectives by 2015 meaning that the 
remainder might be subject to penalties. 
Response: Their survey was based on 
our proposed definition of meaningful 
use. The definition of meaningful use in 
this final rule offers more flexibility and 
lower thresholds which we believe will 
make it easier for eligible hospitals to 
qualify for incentives. However we do 
acknowledge that the meaningful use 
criteria described in this final rule may 
still challenge hospitals to use their IT 
in ways that improve patient care and 
outcomes. We also acknowledge that 
smaller, more rural hospitals could 
experience added burden in achieving 
meaningful use related to timing and 
costs of implementation. Supplemental 
funding to Regional Extension Centers 
to assist CAHs will work to lessen 
disparity between urban and rural 
hospitals. We also believe that the 
presence of incentive payments, market 
demands and rewards for data 
exchange, and future cost savings 
resulting from meaningful use will 
increase hospital adoption and 
meaningful use of EHRs. 
c. Critical Access Hospitals (CAHs) 
We estimate that there are 1,302 CAHs 
eligible to receive EHR incentive 
payments. Given the financial assistance 
available under HITECH for Regional 
Extension Centers, whose priorities 
include assisting CAHs in EHR 
adoption, we estimate that the 19 
percent of CAHs with relatively 
advanced EHR systems will achieve 
meaningful use before 2016. We also 
estimate that most of the remaining 
CAHs that have already adopted some 
kind of EHR system (48 percent of 
CAHs) will also achieve meaningful use 
by 2016. Our estimates regarding the 
incentives that will be paid to CAHs are 
incorporated into the overall Medicare 
and Medicaid program costs. 
We note that in response to comments 
this final rule amends the definition of 
acute care hospital for purposes of the 
Medicaid EHR incentive payment 
program to generally include critical 
access hospitals that meet the Medicaid 
patient volume criteria. Thus, the 
change in the definition has required 
that we update our tables to reflect the 
increased number of hospitals that now 
may qualify for the Medicaid EHR 
incentive payment program under this 
new definition. The numbers and 
percentages from the revised tables are 
reflected throughout this final impact 
analysis. Additionally, EHR adoption 
rates have been adjusted now that CAHs 
will be eligible for both Medicare and 
Medicaid EHR incentive payments. 
6. Medicaid Incentive Program Costs 
Under section 4201 of the HITECH 
Act, States can voluntarily participate in 
the Medicaid incentive payment 
program and we have based our 
Medicaid incentive program costs on all 
States participating. Eligible hospitals 
and EPs can qualify for a Medicaid 
incentive payment for adopting, 
implementing, or upgrading in their first 
participation year, or for meaningful 
use, and up to an additional 5 years of 
incentive payments for demonstrating 
meaningful use of certified EHR 
technology. Under Medicaid, EPs 
include physicians (including 
pediatricians), dentists, certified nurse- 
midwives, nurse practitioners, and 
certain physician assistants. Initial 
incentive payments are available 
through 2016, and incentive payments 
cannot be made after 2021. The 
Medicaid hospital incentives are similar 
to those specified in section 4102 of the 
HITECH Act for Medicare, except that 
they must be paid out over at least 3 
years and are spread out over a 
maximum of 6 years, are based on the 
ratio of Medicaid inpatient days to total 
days, and are not phased down as 
quickly as the Medicare payments based 
on the first year of payment. Medicaid 
hospitals can begin incentive payments 
through 2016, and incentive payments 
cannot be made after 2021. There are 
also additional hospitals, such as 
children’s and cancer hospitals that are 
only eligible for Medicaid incentives. 
EPs may qualify for Medicaid 
incentive payments if at least 30 percent 
of their patient volume is from 
Medicaid. (Separate rules apply for 
pediatricians.) As mentioned above, the 
Medicaid maximum incentive payments 
are larger than the corresponding 
Medicare payments. Various maximums 
are specified for eligible hospital and EP 
incentive payments. There are no 
Medicaid penalties for non-adoption of 
EHR systems or for failing to 
demonstrate meaningful use. The 
Federal costs for Medicaid incentive 
payments to providers who can 
demonstrate meaningful use of EHR 
technology were estimated similarly to 
the estimates for Medicare eligible 
hospital and EP. Table 32 shows our 
high estimates for the net Medicaid 
costs for eligible hospitals and EP.

Table 33 shows the low estimates for 
Medicaid costs and savings. 
a. Medicaid EPs 
To determine the Medicaid EP 
incentive payments, we first determined 
the number of qualifying EPs. As 
indicated above, we assumed that 20 
percent of the non-hospital-based 
Medicare EPs would meet the 
requirements for Medicaid incentive 
payments (30 percent of patient volume 
from Medicaid). All of these EPs were 
assumed to choose the Medicaid 
incentive payments, as they are larger.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
In addition, the total number of 
Medicaid EPs was adjusted to include 
EPs who qualify for the Medicaid 
incentive payments but not for the 
Medicare incentive payments, such as 
most pediatricians, dentists, certified 
nurse-midwives, nurse practitioners and 
physicians assistants. As noted 
previously there is much uncertainty 
about the rates of demonstration of 
meaningful use that will be achieved. 
Therefore, as we estimated for the 
Medicare EPs, we are providing high 
and low scenario estimates for Medicaid 
EPs. 
Our high scenario estimates are listed 
in the Table 34. 
It should be noted that since the 
Medicaid EHR incentive payment 
program provides that a Medicaid EP 
can receive an incentive payment in 
their first year because he or she has 
demonstrated a meaningful use or 
because he or she has adopted, 
implemented, or upgraded certified EHR 
technology, these participation rates 
include not only meaningful users but 
eligible providers implementing 
certified EHR technology as well. Table 
35 shows our low scenario estimates.

b. Medicaid Hospitals 
Medicaid incentive payments to most 
acute-care hospitals were estimated 
using the same adoption assumptions 
and methodology as described 
previously for Medicare eligible 
hospitals and shown in Table 36. 
Because hospitals’ Medicare and 
Medicaid patient loads differ, we 
separately calculated the range of 
percentage of total potential incentives 
that could be associated with qualifying 
hospitals, year by year, and the 
corresponding actual percentages 
payable each year. Acute care hospitals 
and children’s hospitals can spread 
aggregate Medicaid incentive payments 
over no less than 3 years, but no more 
than 6 years of payments, and acute care 
hospitals may qualify to receive both the 
Medicare and Medicaid incentive 
payments. 
As stated previously, the estimated 
eligible hospital incentive payments 
were calculated based on the hospitals’ 
qualifying status and individual 
incentive amounts payable under the 
statutory formula. The estimated savings 
in Medicaid benefit expenditures 
resulting from the use of certified EHR 
technology are discussed under ‘‘general 
considerations.’’ We estimated the 
Medicaid incentives payable to 
children’s hospitals as an add-on to the 
base estimate, using data on the number 
of children’s hospitals compared to non- 
children’s hospitals. 
Table 37 shows our low scenario 
estimates. 
7. Benefits for All EPs and All Eligible 
Hospitals 
In this final rule we have not 
quantified the overall benefits to the 
industry, nor to eligible hospitals, or 
EPs in the Medicare, Medicaid, or MA 
programs. We believe that the first 5 
years of the incentive program will be 
dedicated to implementation activities, 
from installation of the technology to 
training to operational and behavioral 
changes. Information on the costs and 
benefits of adopting systems specifically 
meeting the requirements in this rule 
does not yet exist—and information on 
costs and benefits overall is limited 
(Goldzweig et al. 2009 ‘‘Costs and 
Benefits of Health Information

Literature’’ Health Affairs.) 
Nonetheless, we believe there are 
benefits that can be obtained by eligible 
hospitals and EPs, including: reductions 
in medical record-keeping costs, 
reductions in repeat tests, decreases in 
length of stay, and reduced errors. 
Furthermore, there is limited but 
growing evidence to support the cost- 
saving benefits anticipated from wider 
adoption of EHRs. For example, at one 
hospital emergency room in Delaware, 
the ability to download and create a file 
with a patient’s medical history saved 
the ER $545 per use, mostly on reduced 
waiting times. A pilot study of 
ambulatory practices found a positive 
ROI within 16 months and annual 
savings thereafter (Greiger et al. 2007, A 
Pilot Study to Document the Return on 
Investment for Implementing an 
Ambulatory Electronic Health Record at 
an Academic Medical Center http:// 
www.journalacs.org/article/S1072-
7515%2807%2900390-0/abstract- 
article-footnote-1s.) Some vendors have 
estimated that EHRs could result in cost 
savings of between $100 and $200 per 
patient per year. As adoption increases, 
there will be more opportunities to 
capture and report on cost savings and 
benefits. A number of relevant studies 
are required in the HITECH Act for this 
specific purpose, and the results will be 
made public, as they are available. 
8. Benefits to Society 
According to the recent CBO study 
‘‘Evidence on the Costs and Benefits of 
Health Information Technology’’ http:// 
www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/91xx/doc9168/05- 
20-HealthIT.pdf when used effectively, 
EHRs can enable providers to deliver 
health care more efficiently. For 
example, the study states that EHRs can 
reduce the duplication of diagnostic 
tests, prompt providers to prescribe 
cost-effective generic medications, 
remind patients about preventive care 
reduce unnecessary office visits and 
assist in managing complex care. 
Further, the report claims that there is 
a potential to gain both internal and 
external savings from widespread 
adoption of health IT, noting that 
internal savings would likely be in the 
reductions in the cost of providing care, 
and that external savings could accrue 
to the health insurance plan or even the 
patient, such as the ability to exchange 
information more efficiently. The 
benefits resulting specifically from this 
final regulation are even harder to 
quantify because they represent, in 
many cases, adding functionality to 
existing systems and reaping the 
network externalities created by larger 
numbers of providers participating in 
information exchange. 
Since the CBO study, additional 
research has emerged documenting the 
association of EHRs with improved 
outcomes among diabetics (Hunt, JS et 
al. (2009) ‘‘The impact of a physician- 
directed health information technology 
system on diabetes outcomes in primary 
care: a pre- and post-implementation 
study’’ Informatics in Primary Care 
17(3):165–74; Pollard, C et al. (2009) 
‘‘Electronic patient registries improve 
diabetes care and clinical outcomes in 
rural community health centers’’ Journal 
of Rural Health 25(1):77–84) and trauma 
patients (Deckelbaum, D. et al. (2009) 
‘‘Electronic medical records and 
mortality in trauma patients ‘‘The 
Journal of Trauma: Injury, Infection, and 
Critical Care 67(3): 634–636), enhanced 
efficiencies in ambulatory care settings 
(Chen, C et al. (2009) ‘‘The Kaiser 
Permanente Electronic Health Record: 
Transforming and Streamlining 
Modalities Of Care.’’Health Affairs 
28(2):323–333), and improved outcomes 
and lower costs in hospitals 
(Amarasingham, R. et al. (2009) 
‘‘Clinical information technologies and 
inpatient outcomes: a multiple hospital 
study’’ Archives of Internal Medicine 
169(2):108–14). 
9. General Considerations 
The estimates for the HITECH Act 
provisions were based on the economic 
assumptions underlying the President’s 
2011 Budget. Under the statute, 
Medicare incentive payments for 
certified EHR technology are excluded 
from the determination of MA 
capitation benchmarks. As noted 
previously, there is considerable 
uncertainty about the rate at which 
eligible hospitals, CAHs and EPs will 
adopt EHRs and other HIT. Nonetheless, 
we believe that the Medicare incentive 
payments and the prospect of significant 
payment penalties for not demonstrating 
meaningful use will result in the great 
majority of hospitals implementing 
certified EHR technology in the early 
years of the Medicare EHR incentive 
program. We expect that a steadily 
growing proportion of practices will 
implement certified EHR technology 
over the next 10 years, even in the 
absence of the Medicare incentives. 
Actual future Medicare and Medicaid 
costs for eligible hospital and EP 
incentives will depend in part on the 
standards developed and applied for 
assessing meaningful use of certified 
EHR technology. We expect to 
administer the requirements in such a 
way as to encourage adoption of 
certified EHR technology and facilitate 
qualification for incentive payments, 
and expect to adopt progressively 
demanding standards at each stage year. 
Certified EHR technology has the 
potential to help reduce medical costs 
through efficiency improvements, such 
as prompter treatments, avoidance of 
duplicate or otherwise unnecessary 
services, and reduced administrative 
costs (once systems are in place), with 
most of these savings being realized by 
the providers rather than by Medicare or 
Medicaid. To the extent that this 
technology will have a net positive 
effect on efficiency, then more rapid 
adoption of such EHR systems would 
achieve these efficiencies sooner than 
would otherwise occur, without the 
EHR incentives. 
The CBO has estimated a modest level 
of such savings attributable to EHRs, 
with much of the amount associated 
with reductions in adverse drug-to-drug 
interactions. We expect a negligible 
impact on benefit payments to hospitals 
and EPs from Medicare and Medicaid as 
a result of the implementation of EHR 
technology. 
In the process of preparing the 
estimates for this rule, we consulted 
with and/or relied on internal CMS 
sources, as well as the following 
sources: 
• Congressional Budget Office (staff 
and publications). 
• American Medical Association 
(staff and unpublished data). 
• American Hospital Association. 
• Actuarial Research Corporation. 
• RAND Health studies on: 
++ ‘‘The State and Pattern of Health 
Information Technology Adoption’’ 
(Fonkych & Taylor, 2005); 
++ ‘‘Extrapolating Evidence of Health 
Information Technology Savings and 
Costs’’ (Girosi, Meili, & Scoville, 
2005); and 
++ ‘‘The Diffusion and Value of 
Healthcare Information Technology’’ 
(Bower, 2005). 
• Kaiser Permanente (staff and 
publications). 
• Miscellaneous other sources (Health 
Affairs, American Enterprise Institute, 
news articles and perspectives). 
As noted at the beginning of this 
analysis, it is difficult to predict the 
actual impacts of the HITECH Act with 
much certainty at this time. We believe 
the assumptions and methods described 
herein are reasonable for estimating the 
financial impact of the provisions on the 
Medicare and Medicaid programs, but 
acknowledge the wide range of possible 
outcomes. 
All financial analysis is calculated 
over a 10-year planning horizon, 
because though the incentive payments 
for Medicare EPs, CAHs and eligible

hospitals will only be paid for 5 years, 
the Medicaid incentives will cease in 
CY 2021. Starting in CY 2015, Medicare 
payment adjustments will begin. 
10. Summary 
The total cost to the Medicare and 
Medicaid programs is estimated to be 
$9.7 billion in transfers under the low 
scenario, and $27.4 billion under the 
high scenario, over a 10-year timeframe. 
The main reasons for the changes from 
the proposed rule are revised definitions 
of hospital-based eligible professional 
and Medicaid acute care hospitals, and 
updated data on discharges and costs of 
adoption among hospitals. We do not 
estimate total costs to the provider 
industry, but rather provide a possible 
per EP and per eligible hospital outlay 
for implementation and maintenance 
operations. 
Table 39 shows the total costs from 
2011 through 2019 for the high scenario 
after which the payment adjustments 
will be invoked. 
11. Explanation of Benefits and Savings 
Calculations 
In our analysis, we assume that 
benefits to the program would accrue in 
the form of savings to Medicare, through 
the Medicare EP payment adjustments. 
Expected qualitative benefits, such as 
improved quality of care, better health 
outcomes, and the like, are still unable 
to be quantified at this time.

12866, we are required to develop an

classification of the expenditures 
associated with the provisions of this 
final rule. Monetary annualized benefits 
and nonbudgetary costs are presented as 
discounted flows using 3 percent and 7 
percent factors. Additional expenditures 
that will be undertaken by eligible 
entities in order to obtain the Medicare 
and Medicaid incentive payments to 
adopt and demonstrate meaningful use 
of certified EHR technology, and to 
avoid the Medicare payment 
adjustments that will ensue if they fail 
to do so are noted by a placeholder in 
the accounting statement. We are not 
able to explicitly define the universe of 
those additional costs, nor specify what 
the high or low range might be to 
implement EHR technology in this final 
rule. 
Expected qualitative benefits include 
improved quality of care, better health 
outcomes, reduced errors and the like. 
Private industry costs would include the 
impact of EHR activities such as 
temporary reduced staff productivity 
related to learning how to use the EHR, 
the need for additional staff to work 
with HIT issues, and administrative 
costs related to reporting. 
In accordance with the provisions of 
Executive Order 12866, this final rule 
was reviewed by the Office of 
Management and Budget.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
Medicare payment is made under 
section 1814(l) of the Act for inpatient 
services and under section 1834(g) of 
the Act for outpatient services. 
EHR reporting period means either of 
the following: 
(1) For an eligible professional (EP)— 
(i) For the first payment year, any 
continuous 90-day period within a 
calendar year; 
(ii)(A) Except as specified in 
paragraph (1)(ii)(B) of this definition, for 
the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth 
payment year, the calendar year. 
(B) For Medicaid providers who are 
demonstrating they are meaningful EHR 
users for the first time in their second 
payment year, the EHR reporting period 
during such second payment year is any 
continuous 90-day period within the 
calendar year. 
(2) For an eligible hospital or a CAH— 
(i) For the first payment year, any 
continuous 90-day period within a 
federal fiscal year; and 
(ii)(A) Except as specified in 
paragraph (2)(ii)(B) of this definition, for 
the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth 
payment year, the Federal fiscal year. 
(B) For Medicaid providers who are 
demonstrating they are meaningful EHR 
users for the first time in their second 
payment year, the EHR reporting period 
during such second payment year is any 
continuous 90-day period within the 
Federal fiscal year. 
Eligible hospital means an eligible 
hospital as defined under § 495.100 or 
Medicaid eligible hospital under 
subpart D of this part. 
Eligible professional (EP) means an 
eligible professional as defined under 
§ 495.100 or a Medicaid eligible 
professional under subpart D of this 
part. 
Hospital-based EP is an EP (as defined 
under this section) who furnishes 90 
percent or more of his or her covered 
professional services in a hospital 
setting in the year preceding the 
payment year. For Medicare, this will be 
calculated based on the Federal FY prior 
to the payment year. For Medicaid, it is 
at the State’s discretion if the data is 
gathered on the Federal FY or CY prior 
to the payment year. A setting is 
considered a hospital setting if it is a 
site of service that would be identified 
by the codes used in the HIPAA 
standard transactions as an inpatient 
hospital, or emergency room setting. 
Meaningful EHR user means: 
(1) Subject to paragraph (3) of this 
definition, an EP, eligible hospital or 
CAH that, for an EHR reporting period 
for a payment year, demonstrates in 
accordance with § 495.8 meaningful use 
of certified EHR technology by meeting 
the applicable objectives and associated 
measures under § 495.6; and 
(2)(i) Except as specified in paragraph 
(2)(ii) of this definition, a Medicaid EP 
or Medicaid eligible hospital, that meets 
the requirements of paragraph (1) of this 
definition and any additional criteria for 
meaningful use imposed by the State 
and approved by CMS under § 495.316 
and § 495.332. 
(ii) An eligible hospital or CAH is 
deemed to be a meaningful EHR user for 
purposes of receiving an incentive 
payment under subpart D of this Part, if 
the hospital participates in both the 
Medicare and Medicaid EHR incentive 
programs, and the hospital meets the 
requirements of paragraph (1) of this 
definition. 
(3) To be considered a meaningful 
EHR user, at least 50 percent of an EP’s 
patient encounters during the EHR 
reporting period during the payment 
year must occur at a practice/location or 
practices/locations equipped with 
certified EHR technology. 
Payment year means: 
(1) For an EP, a calendar year 
beginning with CY 2011; and 
(2) For a CAH or an eligible hospital, 
a Federal fiscal year beginning with FY 
2011. 
Qualified EHR has the same definition 
as this term is defined at 45 CFR 
170.102. 
First, second, third, fourth, fifth, or 
sixth payment years mean as follows: 
(1) The first payment year is: with 
respect to an EP, the first calendar year 
for which the EP receives an incentive 
payment under this part; and with 
respect to an eligible hospital or CAH, 
the first FY for which the hospital 
receives an incentive payment under 
this part. 
(2) The second, third, fourth, fifth, or 
sixth payment year is: 
(i) With respect to a Medicare EP, the 
second, third, fourth or fifth successive 
CY immediately following the first 
payment year; and with respect to a 
Medicare eligible hospital or CAH, the 
second, third, or fourth successive 
Federal FY immediately following the 
first payment year. (Note: Medicare EPs 
are not eligible for a sixth payment year 
and Medicare eligible hospitals are not 
eligible for a fifth or sixth payment 
year.) 
(ii)(A) With respect to a Medicaid EP, 
the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth 
CY for which the EP receives an 
incentive payment under subpart D, 
regardless of whether the year 
immediately follows the prior payment 
year; and 
(B) With respect to a Medicaid eligible 
hospital, for years prior to FY 2017, the 
second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth 
Federal FY for which the hospital 
receives an incentive payment under 
subpart D of this part, regardless of 
whether the year immediately follows 
the prior payment year. Beginning with 
FY 2017, payments to Medicaid eligible 
hospitals must be consecutive, and the 
hospital is not eligible for an incentive 
payment under subpart D of this part 
unless it received such incentive 
payment for the prior fiscal year. 
§ 495.6
Meaningful use objectives and 
measures for EPs, eligible hospitals, and 
CAHs. 
(a) Stage 1 criteria for EPs—(1) 
General rule regarding Stage 1 criteria 
for meaningful use for EPs. Except as 
specified in paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) 
of this section, EPs must meet all 
objectives and associated measures of 
the Stage 1 criteria specified in 
paragraph (d) of this section and five 
objectives of the EP’s choice from 
paragraph (e) of this section to meet the 
definition of a meaningful EHR user. 
(2) Exclusion for non-applicable 
objectives. (i) An EP may exclude a 
particular objective contained in 
paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, if 
the EP meets all of the following 
requirements: 
(A) Must ensure that the objective in 
paragraph (d) or (e) of this section 
includes an option for the EP to attest 
that the objective is not applicable. 
(B) Meets the criteria in the applicable 
objective that would permit the 
attestation. 
(C) Attests. 
(ii) An exclusion will reduce (by the 
number of exclusions applicable) the 
number of objectives that would 
otherwise apply. For example, an EP 
that has an exclusion from one of the 
objectives in paragraph (e) of this 
section must meet four (and not five) 
objectives of the EP’s choice from such 
paragraph to meet the definition of a 
meaningful EHR user. 
(3) Exception for Medicaid EPs who 
adopt, implement or upgrade in their 
first payment year. For Medicaid EPs 
who adopt, implement, or upgrade 
certified EHR technology in their first 
payment year, the meaningful use 
objectives and associated measures of 
the Stage 1 criteria specified in 
paragraphs (d) and (e) apply beginning 
with the second payment year, and do 
not apply to the first payment year. 
(b) Stage 1 criteria for eligible 
hospitals and CAHs—(1) General rule 
regarding Stage 1 criteria for meaningful 
use for eligible hospitals or CAHs. 
Except as specified in paragraphs (b)(2) 
and (b)(3) of this section, eligible 
hospitals and CAHs must meet all 
objectives and associated measures of

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
the Stage 1 criteria specified in 
paragraph (f) of this section and five 
objectives of the eligible hospital’s or 
CAH’s choice from paragraph (g) of this 
section to meet the definition of a 
meaningful EHR user. 
(2) Exclusions for nonapplicable 
objectives. (i) An eligible hospital or 
CAH may exclude a particular objective 
that includes an option for exclusion 
contained in paragraphs (f) or (g) of this 
section, if the hospital meets all of the 
following requirements: 
(A) The hospital meets the criteria in 
the applicable objective that would 
permit an exclusion. 
(B) The hospital so attests. 
(ii) An exclusion will reduce (by the 
number of exclusions received) the 
number of objectives that would 
otherwise apply. For example, an 
eligible hospital that is excluded from 
one of the objectives in paragraph (g) of 
this section must meet four (and not 
five) objectives of the hospital’s choice 
from such paragraph to meet the 
definition of a meaningful EHR user. 
(3) Exception for Medicaid eligible 
hospitals that adopt, implement or 
upgrade in their first payment year. For 
Medicaid eligible hospitals that adopt, 
implement, or upgrade certified EHR 
technology in their first payment year, 
the meaningful use objectives and 
associated measures of the Stage 1 
criteria specified in paragraphs (f) and 
(g) of this section apply beginning with 
the second payment year, and do not 
apply to the first payment year. 
(c) Many of the objective and 
associated measures in paragraphs (d) 
through (g) of this section rely on 
measures that count unique patients or 
actions. 
(1) If a measure (or associated 
objective) in paragraphs (d) through (g) 
of this section references paragraph (c) 
of this section, then the measure may be 
calculated by reviewing only the actions 
for patients whose records are 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology. A patient’s record is 
maintained using certified EHR 
technology if sufficient data was entered 
in the certified EHR technology to allow 
the record to be saved, and not rejected 
due to incomplete data. 
(2) If the objective and associated 
measure does not reference this 
paragraph (c) of this section, then the 
measure must be calculated by 
reviewing all patient records, not just 
those maintained using certified EHR 
technology. 
(d) Stage 1 core criteria for EPs. An EP 
must satisfy the following objectives 
and associated measures, except those 
objectives and associated measures for 
which an EP qualifies for an exclusion 
under paragraph (a)(2) of this section

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
(SSN) to which the EP’s incentive 
payment should be made. 
(d) In the event the information 
specified in paragraphs (a) through (c) of 
this section as previously submitted to 
CMS is no longer accurate, the EP, 
eligible hospital or CAH must provide 
updated information to CMS or the State 
on a timely basis in the manner 
specified by CMS or the State. 
(e) An EP that qualifies as both a 
Medicaid EP and Medicare EP— 
(1) Must notify CMS in the manner 
specified by CMS as to whether he or 
she elects to participate in the Medicare 
or the Medicaid EHR incentive program; 
(2) After receiving at least one EHR 
incentive payment, may switch between 
the two EHR incentive programs only 
one time, and only for a payment year

begun in and remained in the program 
to which he or she has switched. For 
example, an EP that begins receiving 
Medicaid incentive payments in 2011, 
and then switches to the Medicare 
program for 2012, is in his or her second 
payment year in 2012. 
(f) Limitations on incentive payment 
reassignments. (1) EPs are permitted to

their employer or to an entity with 
which they have a contractual 
arrangement allowing the employer or 
entity to bill and receive payment for 
the EP’s covered professional services. 
(2)(i) Assignments in Medicare must 
be consistent with Section 1842(b)(6)(A) 
of the Act and 42 CFR part 424 subpart

reporting period for a payment year and 
who is not a hospital-based EP, as 
determined for that payment year. 
Qualifying hospital means an eligible 
hospital that is a meaningful EHR user 
for the EHR reporting period for a 
payment year. 
§ 495.102
Incentive payments to EPs. 
(a) General rules. (1) Subject to 
paragraph (b) of this section, in addition 
to the amount otherwise paid under 
section 1848 of the Act, there must be 
paid to a qualifying EP (or to an 
employer or entity in the cases 
described in section 1842(b)(6)(A) of the 
Act) for a payment year an amount 
equal to 75 percent of the estimated 
allowed charges for covered 
professional services furnished by the 
EP during the payment year. 
(2) For purposes of this paragraph (a) 
of this section, the estimated allowed 
charges for the qualifying EP’s covered 
professional services during the 
payment year are determined based on 
claims submitted no later than 2 months 
after the end of the payment year, and, 
in the case of a qualifying EP who 
furnishes covered professional services 
in more than one practice, are 
determined based on claims submitted 
for the EP’s covered professional 
services across all such practices. 
(b) Limitations on amounts of

(vi) For any succeeding payment year 
for such professional, $0. 
(2)(i) If the first payment year for a 
qualifying EP is 2014, then the payment 
limit for a payment year for the 
qualifying EP is the same as the amount 
specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this 
section for such payment year for a 
qualifying EP whose first payment year 
is 2013. 
(ii) If the first payment year for a 
qualifying EP is after 2014, then the 
payment limit specified in this 
paragraph for such EP for such year and 
any subsequent year is $0. 
(c) Increase in incentive payment 
limit for EPs who predominantly furnish 
services in a geographic HPSA. In the 
case of a qualifying EP who in the year 
prior to the payment year furnishes 
more than 50 percent of his or her 
covered professional services in a 
geographic HPSA that is designated as 
of December 31 of such year, the 
incentive payment limit determined 
under paragraph (b) of this section is to 
be increased by 10 percent. 
(d) Payment adjustment effective in 
CY 2015 and subsequent years for 
nonqualifying EPs. 
(1) Subject to paragraph (d)(3) of this 
section, beginning in 2015, for covered 
professional services furnished by an EP 
who is not a qualifying EP or a hospital- 
based EP for the year, the payment 
amount for such services is equal the 
product of the applicable percent 
specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this 
section and the Medicare physician fee 
schedule amount for such services. 
(2) Applicable percent. Applicable 
percent is as follows:

The Secretary may, on a case-by-case 
basis, exempt an EP who is not a 
qualifying EP from the application of 
the payment adjustment under 
paragraph (d)(1) of this section if the 
Secretary determines that compliance 
with the requirement for being a 
meaningful EHR user would result in a 
significant hardship for the EP. 
(ii) The Secretary’s determination to 
grant an EP an exemption under 
paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section may be 
renewed on an annual basis, provided 
that in no case may an EP be granted an

§ 495.104
Incentive payments to eligible 
hospitals. 
(a) General rule. A qualifying hospital 
(as defined in this subpart) must receive 
the special incentive payment as 
determined under the formulas 
described in paragraph (c) of this 
section for the period specified in 
paragraph (b) of this section. 
(b) Transition periods. Subject to 
paragraph (d) of this section and the 
payment formula specified in paragraph 
(c) of this section, qualifying hospitals 
may receive incentive payments during 
transition periods which comprise the 
following fiscal years: 
(1) Hospitals whose first payment year 
is FY 2011 may receive such payments 
for FYs 2011 through 2014. 
(2) Hospitals whose first payment year 
is FY 2012 may receive such payments 
for FYs 2012 through 2015. 
(3) Hospitals whose first payment year 
is FY 2013 may receive such payments 
for FYs 2013 through 2016. 
(4) Hospitals whose first payment year 
is FY 2014 may receive such payments 
for FY 2014 through 2016. 
(5) Hospitals whose first payment year 
is FY 2015 may receive such payments 
for FY 2015 through 2016. 
(c) Payment methodology. (1) The 
incentive payment for each payment 
year is calculated as the product of the 
following: 
(i) The initial amount determined 
under paragraph (c)(3) of this section. 
(ii) The Medicare share fraction 
determined under paragraph (c)(4) of 
this section. 
(iii) The transition factor determined 
under paragraph (c)(5) of this section. 
(2) Interim and final payments. CMS 
uses data on hospital acute care 
inpatient discharges, Medicare Part A 
acute care inpatient-bed-days, Medicare 
Part C acute care inpatient-bed-days, 
and total acute care inpatient-bed-days, 
from the latest submitted 12-month 
hospital cost report as the basis for 
making preliminary incentive payments. 
Final payments are determined at the 
time of settling the first 12-month 
hospital cost report for the hospital 
fiscal year that begins on or after the 
first day of the payment year, and 
settled on the basis of data from that 
cost reporting period. 
(3) Initial amount. The initial amount 
is equal to one of the following: 
(i) For each hospital with 1,149 acute 
care inpatient discharges or fewer, 
$2,000,000. 
(ii) For each hospital with at least 
1,150 but no more than 23,000 acute 
care inpatient discharges, $2,000,000 + 
[$200 × (n ¥ 1,149)], where n is the 
number of discharges for the hospital. 
(iii) For each hospital with more than 
23,000 acute care inpatient discharges, 
$6,370,200. 
(4) Medicare share fraction—(i) 
General. (A) CMS determines the 
Medicare share fraction for an eligible 
hospital by using the number of 
Medicare Part A, Medicare Part C, and 
total acute care inpatient-bed-days using 
data from the Medicare cost report as 
specified by CMS. 
(B) CMS computes the denominator of 
the Medicare share fraction using the 
charity care charges reported on the 
hospital’s Medicare cost report. 
(ii) The Medicare share fraction is the 
ratio of— 
(A) A numerator which is the sum 
of— 
(1) The number of inpatient-bed-days 
which are attributable to individuals 
with respect to whom payment may be 
made under Part A, including 
individuals enrolled in section 1876 
Medicare cost plans; and 
(2) The number of inpatient-bed-days 
which are attributable to individuals 
who are enrolled with a Medicare 
Advantage organization (as defined in 
§ 422.2 of this chapter). 
(B) A denominator which is the 
product of— 
(1) The total number of acute care 
inpatient-bed-days; and 
(2) The total amount of the eligible 
hospital’s charges, not including any 
charges that are attributable to charity 
care, divided by the estimated total 
amount of the hospitals charges. 
(5) Transition factor. For purposes of 
the payment formula, the transition 
factor is as follows: 
(i) For hospitals whose first payment 
year is FY 2011— 
(A) 1 for FY 2011; 
(B) 3⁄4 for FY 2012; 
(C) 1⁄2 for FY 2013; and 
(D) 1⁄4 for FY 2014. 
(ii) For hospitals whose first payment 
year is FY 2012— 
(A) 1 for FY 2012; 
(B) 3⁄4 for FY 2013; 
(C) 1⁄2 for FY 2014; and 
(D) 1⁄4 for FY 2015; 
(iii) For hospitals whose first payment 
year is FY 2013— 
(A) 1 for FY 2013; 
(B) 3⁄4 for FY 2014; 
(C) 1⁄2 for FY 2015; and 
(D) 1⁄4 for FY 2016. 
(iv) For hospitals whose first payment 
year is FY 2014— 
(A) 3⁄4 for FY 2014; 
(B) 1⁄2 for FY 2015; and 
(C) 1⁄4 for FY 2016. 
(v) For hospitals whose first payment 
year is FY 2015— 
(A) 1⁄2 for FY 2015; and 
(B) 1⁄4 for FY 2016. 
(d) No incentive payment for 
nonqualifying hospitals. After the first 
payment year, an eligible hospital will 
not receive an incentive payment for 
any payment year during which it is not 
a qualifying hospital. 
§ 495.106
Incentive payments to CAHs. 
(a) Definitions. In this section, unless 
otherwise indicated— 
Payment year means a Federal fiscal 
year beginning after FY 2010 but before 
FY 2016. 
Qualifying CAH means a CAH that 
would meet the definition of a 
meaningful EHR user at § 495.4, if it 
were an eligible hospital. 
Reasonable costs incurred for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology for 
a qualifying CAH means the reasonable 
acquisition costs incurred for the 
purchase of depreciable assets as 
described in part 413 subpart G of this 
chapter, such as computers and 
associated hardware and software, 
necessary to administer certified EHR 
technology as defined in § 495.4, 
excluding any depreciation and interest 
expenses associated with the 
acquisition. 
(b) General rule. A qualifying CAH 
receives an incentive payment for its 
reasonable costs incurred for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology, as 
defined in paragraph (a) of this section, 
in the manner described in paragraph 
(c) of this section for a cost reporting 
period beginning during a payment year 
as defined in paragraph (a) of this 
section. 
(c) Payment methodology. (1) 
Payment amount. A qualifying CAH 
receives an incentive payment amount 
equal to the product of its reasonable 
costs incurred for the purchase of 
certified EHR technology and the 
Medicare share percentage.

Federal Register / Vol. 75, No. 144 / Wednesday, July 28, 2010 / Rules and Regulations 
(2) Calculation of reasonable costs. 
CMS or its Medicare contractor 
computes a qualifying CAH’s reasonable 
costs incurred for the purchase of 
certified EHR technology, as defined in 
paragraph (a) of this section, as the sum 
of— 
(i) The reasonable costs incurred for 
the purchase of certified EHR 
technology during the cost reporting 
period that begins in a payment year; 
and 
(ii) Any reasonable costs incurred for 
the purchase of certified EHR 
technology in cost reporting periods 
beginning in years prior to the payment 
year which have not been fully 
depreciated as of the cost reporting 
period beginning in the payment year. 
(3) Medicare share percentage. 
Notwithstanding the percentage 
applicable under § 413.70(a)(1) of this 
chapter, the Medicare share percentage 
equals the lesser of— 
(i) 100 percent; or 
(ii) The sum of the Medicare share 
fraction for the CAH as calculated under 
§ 495.104(c)(4) of this subpart and 20 
percentage points. 
(d) Incentive payments made to 
CAHs. (1) The amount of the incentive 
payment made to a qualifying CAH 
under this section represents the 
expensing and payment of the 
reasonable costs computed in paragraph 
(c) of this section in a single payment 
year and, as specified in § 413.70(a)(5) 
of this chapter, such payment is made 
in lieu of payment that would have been 
made under § 413.70(a)(1) of this 
chapter for the reasonable costs of the 
purchase of certified EHR technology 
including depreciation and interest 
expenses associated with the 
acquisition. 
(2) The amount of the incentive 
payment made to a qualifying CAH 
under this section is paid through a 
prompt interim payment for the 
applicable payment year after— 
(i) The CAH submits the necessary 
documentation, as specified by CMS or 
its Medicare contractors, to support the 
computation of the incentive payment 
amount under this section; and 
(ii) CMS or its Medicare contractor 
reviews such documentation and 
determines the interim amount of the 
incentive payment. 
(3) The interim incentive payment 
made under this paragraph is subject to 
a reconciliation process as specified by 
CMS and the final incentive payment as 
determined by CMS or its Medicare 
contractor is considered payment in full 
for the reasonable costs incurred for the 
purchase of certified EHR technology in 
a single payment year. 
(4) In no case may an incentive 
payment be made with respect to a cost 
reporting period beginning during a 
payment year before FY 2011 or after FY 
2015 and in no case may a CAH receive 
an incentive payment under this section 
with respect to more than 4 consecutive 
payment years. 
(e) Reductions in payment to CAHs. 
For cost reporting periods beginning in 
FY 2015, if a CAH is not a qualifying 
CAH for a payment year, then the 
payment for inpatient services furnished 
by a CAH under § 413.70(a) of this 
chapter is adjusted by the applicable 
percentage described in § 413.70(a)(6) of 
this chapter unless otherwise exempt 
from such adjustment. 
(f) Administrative or judicial review. 
There is no administrative or judicial 
review under sections 1869 or 1878 of 
the Act, or otherwise, of the—

(4) Beginning plan year 2015 and for 
subsequent plan years, all qualifying 
MA organizations, as part of their initial 
bids in June for the following plan year 
must— 
(i) Identify potentially qualifying MA 
EPs and potentially qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals; 
(ii) Include information specified in 
paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) through (C) of this 
section for each professional and 
hospital. 
(iii) Include an attestation that each 
professional and hospital either meets 
or does not meet the EHR incentive 
payment eligibility criteria. 
§ 495.204
Incentive payments to qualifying 
MA organizations for MA–EPs and MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals. 
(a) General rule. A qualifying MA 
organization receives an incentive 
payment for its qualifying MA–EPs and 
its qualifying MA-eligible hospitals. The 
incentive payment amount paid to a 
qualifying MA organization for a— 
(1) Qualifying MA–EP is the amount 
determined under paragraph (b) of this 
section; and 
(2) Qualifying MA-eligible hospital is 
the amount determined under paragraph 
(c) of this section. 
(b) Amount payable to qualifying MA 
organization for qualifying MA EPs. 
(1) CMS substitutes an amount 
determined to be equivalent to the 
amount computed under § 495.102 of 
this part. 
(2) The qualifying MA organization 
must report to CMS within 60 days of 
the close of the calendar year, the 
aggregate annual amount of revenue 
attributable to providing services that 
would otherwise be covered as 
professional services under Part B 
received by each qualifying MA EP for 
enrollees in MA plans of the MA 
organization in the payment year. 
(3) CMS calculates the incentive 
amount for the MA organization for 
each qualifying MA EP as an amount 
equal to 75 percent of the reported 
annual revenue specified in paragraph 
(b)(2) of this section, up to the 
maximum amounts specified under 
section 1848(o)(1)(B) of the Act. 
(4) For qualifying MA EPs who are 
compensated on a salaried basis, CMS 
requires the qualifying MA organization 
to develop a methodology for estimating 
the portion of each qualifying MA EP’s 
salary attributable to providing services 
that would otherwise be covered as 
professional services under Part B to 
MA plan enrollees of the MA 
organization in the payment year. The 
methodology— 
(i) Must be approved by CMS; and 
(ii) May include an additional amount 
related to overhead, where appropriate, 
estimated to account for the MA- 
enrollee related Part B practice costs of 
the salaried qualifying MA EP. 
(iii) Methodological proposals must 
be submitted to CMS by June of the 
payment year and must be auditable by 
an independent third-party. CMS will 
review and approve or disapprove such 
proposals in a timely manner. 
(5) For qualifying MA EPs who are not 
salaried, qualifying MA organizations 
may obtain attestations from such 
qualifying MA EPs (or from entities that 
the MA EPs are employed by or with 
which they have a partnership interest) 
as to the amount of compensation 
received by such EPs for MA plan 
enrollees of the MA organization. The 
organizations may submit to CMS 
compensation information for each such 
MA EP based on such attestations. 
(6) For qualifying MA EPs who are not 
salaried, qualified MA organizations 
may have qualifying MA EPs (or from 
entities that the MA EPs are employed 
by or with which they have a 
partnership interest) send MA 
organization compensation information 
directly to CMS. CMS will use the 
information provided in this 
subparagraph or paragraph (b)(5) of this 
section for no other purpose than to 
compute the amount of EHR incentive 
payment due the MA organization. 
(c) Amount payable to qualifying MA 
organization for qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals. (1)(i) CMS 
substitutes an amount determined to be 
equivalent to the amount computed 
under § 495.104, to the extent data are 
not available to compute payments for 
qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals under the Medicare FFS EHR 
hospital incentive program. 
(ii) CMS uses the same methodology 
and defines ‘‘inpatient-bed-days’’and 
other terms as used under the Medicare 
FFS EHR hospital incentive program in 
§ 495.104 of this part in computing 
amounts due qualifying MA 
organizations for MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals. 
(2) To the extent data are available, 
qualifying MA organizations must 
receive hospital incentive payments 
through their affiliated hospitals under 
the Medicare FFS EHR hospital 
incentive program, rather than through 
the MA EHR hospital incentive 
program. 
(d) Payment to qualifying MA 
organizations. CMS makes payment to 
qualifying MA organizations for 
qualifying MA EPs only under the MA 
EHR incentive program and not under 
the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program to the extent an EP has earned 
less than the maximum incentive 
payment for the same period under the 
Medicare FFS EHR incentive program. 
(e) Payment review under MA. To 
ensure the accuracy of the incentive 
payments, CMS conducts selected 
compliance reviews of qualifying MA 
organizations to ensure that EPs and 
eligible hospitals for which such 
qualifying organizations received 
incentive payments were meaningful 
EHR users in accordance with § 422.504 
of this chapter. 
(1) The reviews include validation of 
the status of the organization as a 
qualifying MA organization, verification 
of meaningful use and review of data 
used to calculate incentive payments. 
(2) MA organizations are required to 
maintain evidence of their qualification 
to receive incentive payments and the 
data necessary to accurately calculate 
incentive payments. 
(3) Documents and records must be 
maintained for 6 years from the date 
such payments are made with respect to 
a given payment year. 
(4) Payments that result from 
incorrect or fraudulent attestations, cost 
data, or any other submission required 
to establish eligibility or to qualify for 
such payment, will be recouped by CMS 
from the MA organization. 
§ 495.206
Timeframe for payment to 
qualifying MA organizations. 
(a) CMS makes payment to qualifying 
MA organizations for qualifying MA EPs 
under the MA EHR incentive program 
after computing incentive payments due 
under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program according to § 495.102. 
(b) Payments to qualifying MA 
organizations for qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospitals under 
common corporate governance are made 
under the Medicare FFS EHR incentive 
program, following the timeline in 
specified in § 495.104 of this part. To 
the extent sufficient data do not exist to 
pay qualifying MA-affiliated eligible 
hospitals under common corporate 
governance under the Medicare FFS 
EHR incentive program, payment is 
made under the MA EHR incentive 
program, following the same timeline in 
§ 495.104 of this part. 
§ 495.208
Avoiding duplicate payment. 
(a) Unless a qualifying MA EP is 
entitled to a maximum payment for a 
year under the Medicare FFS EHR 
incentive program, payment for such an 
individual is only made under the MA 
EHR incentive program to a qualifying 
MA organization. 
(b) Payment to qualifying MA 
organizations for a qualifying MA- 
affiliated eligible hospital under 
common governance only occurs under

judicial review under section 1869 or 
1878 of the Act, or otherwise of the 
methodology and standards for 
determining payment amounts and 
payment adjustments under the MA 
EHR EP incentive program. This

hospital under this subpart are subject 
to all of the following conditions: 
(1) The payment is provided over a 
minimum of a 3-year period and 
maximum of a 6-year period. 
(2) The total incentive payment 
received over all payment years of the 
program is not greater than the aggregate 
EHR incentive amount, as calculated 
under paragraph (g) of this section. 
(3) No single incentive payment for a 
payment year may exceed 50 percent of 
the aggregate EHR hospital incentive 
amount calculated under paragraph (g) 
of this section for an individual 
hospital. 
(4) No incentive payments over a 2- 
year period may exceed 90 percent of 
the aggregate EHR hospital incentive 
amount calculated under paragraph (g) 
of this section for an individual 
hospital. 
(5) No hospital may begin receiving 
incentive payments for any year after FY 
2016, and after FY 2016, a hospital may 
not receive an incentive payment unless 
it received an incentive payment in the 
prior fiscal year. 
(6) Prior to FY 2016, payments can be 
made to an eligible hospital on a non- 
consecutive, annual basis for the fiscal 
year. 
(7) A multi-site hospital with one 
CMS Certification Number is considered 
one hospital for purposes of calculating 
payment. 
(g) Calculation of the aggregate EHR 
hospital incentive amount. The 
aggregate EHR hospital incentive 
amount is calculated as the product of 
the (overall EHR amount) times (the 
Medicaid Share). 
(1) Overall EHR amount. The overall 
EHR amount for an eligible hospital is 
based upon a theoretical 4 years of 
payment the hospital would receive 
based, for each of such 4 years, upon the 
product of the following: 
(i) Initial amount. The initial amount 
is equal to the sum of— 
(A) The base amount which is set at 
$2,000,000 for each of the theoretical 4 
years; plus 
(B) The discharge-related amount for 
a 12-month period selected by the State, 
but ending in the Federal fiscal year 
before the hospital’s fiscal year that 
serves as the first payment year. The 
discharge-related amount is the sum of 
the following, with discharges over the 
12-month period and based upon the 
total discharges for the eligible hospital 
(regardless of any source of payment): 
(1) For the first through 1,149th 
discharge, $0. 
(2) For the 1,150th through the 
23,000th discharge, $200. 
(3) For any discharge greater than the 
23,000th, $0. 
(C) For purposes of calculating the 
discharge-related amount under 
paragraph (g)(1)(i)(B) of this section, for 
the last 3 of the theoretical 4 years of 
payment, discharges are assumed to 
increase by the provider’s average 
annual rate of growth for the most 
recent 3 years for which data are 
available per year. Negative rates of 
growth must be applied as such. 
(ii) Medicare share. The Medicare 
share, which equals 1. 
(iii) Transition factor. The transition 
factor which equals as follows: 
(A) For the first of the theoretical 4 
years, 1. 
(B) For the second of the theoretical 
4 years, 3⁄4. 
(C) For the third of the theoretical 4 
years, 1⁄2. 
(D) For the fourth of the theoretical 4 
years, 1⁄4. 
(2) Medicaid share. The Medicaid 
share specified under this paragraph for 
an eligible hospital is equal to a 
fraction— 
(i) The numerator of which is the sum 
(for the 12-month period selected by the 
State and with respect to the eligible 
hospital) of— 
(A) The estimated number of 
inpatient-bed-days which are 
attributable to Medicaid individuals; 
and 
(B) The estimated number of 
inpatient-bed-days which are 
attributable to individuals who are 
enrolled in a managed care organization, 
a pre-paid inpatient health plan, or a 
pre-paid ambulatory health plan under 
part 438 of this chapter; and 
(ii) The denominator of which is the 
product of— 
(A) The estimated total number of 
inpatient-bed-days with respect to the 
eligible hospital during such period; 
and 
(B) The estimated total amount of the 
eligible hospital’s charges during such 
period, not including any charges that 
are attributable to charity care, divided 
by the estimated total amount of the 
hospital’s charges during such period. 
(iii) In computing inpatient-bed-days 
under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section, 
a State may not include estimated 
inpatient-bed-days attributable to 
individuals with respect to whom 
payment may be made under Medicare 
Part A, or inpatient-bed-days 
attributable to individuals who are 
enrolled with a Medicare Advantage 
organization under Medicare Part C. 
(h) Approximate proxy for charity 
care. If the State determines that an 
eligible provider’s data are not available 
on charity care necessary to calculate 
the portion of the formula specified in 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the 
State may use that provider’s data on 
uncompensated care to determine an 
appropriate proxy for charity care, but 
must include a downward adjustment to 
eliminate bad debt from uncompensated 
care data. The State must use auditable 
data sources. 
(i) Deeming. In the absence of the data 
necessary, with respect to an eligible 
hospital the amount described in 
paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section 
must be deemed to be 1. In the absence 
of data, with respect to an eligible 
hospital, necessary to compute the 
amount described in paragraph 
(g)(2)(i)(B) of this section, the amount 
under such clause must be deemed to be 
0. 
(j) Dual eligibility for incentives 
payments. A hospital may receive 
incentive payments from both Medicare 
and Medicaid if it meets all eligibility 
criteria in the payment year. 
(k) Payments to State-designated 
entities. Payments to entities promoting 
the adoption of certified EHR 
technology as designated by the State 
must meet the following requirements: 
(1) A Medicaid EP may reassign his or 
her incentive payment to an entity 
promoting the adoption of certified EHR 
technology, as defined in § 495.302, and 
as designated by the State, only under 
the following conditions: 
(i) The State has established a method 
to designate entities promoting the 
adoption of EHR technology that 
comports with the Federal definition in 
§ 495.302. 
(ii) The State publishes and makes 
available to all EPs a voluntary 
mechanism for reassigning annual 
payments and includes information 
about the verification mechanism the 
State will use to ensure that the 
reassignment is voluntary and that no 
more than 5 percent of the annual 
payment is retained by the entity for 
costs not related to certified EHR 
technology. 
(2) [Reserved]. 
§ 495.312
Process for payments. 
(a) General rule. States must have a 
process for making payments consistent 
with the requirements in subparts A and 
D of this part. 
(b) Reporting data consistent with this 
subpart. In order to receive a payment 
under this part, a provider must report 
the required data under subpart A and 
this subpart within the EHR reporting 
period described in § 495.4. 
(c) State role. The State determines 
the provider’s eligibility for the EHR 
incentive payment under subpart A and 
this subpart and approves, processes, 
and makes timely payments using a 
process approved by CMS.

organizational conflicts of interest as 
well as noncompetitive practices among 
contractors that may restrict or 
eliminate competition or otherwise 
restrain trade. 
(2) In order to ensure objective 
contractor performance and eliminate 
unfair competitive advantage, 
contractors that develop or draft grant 
applications, or contract specifications, 
requirements, statements of work, 
invitations for bids and requests for 
proposals must be excluded from 
competing for such procurements.

the technical requirements for the 
material, product or service to be 
procured. In competitive procurements, 
such a description must not contain 
features which unduly restrict 
competition. 
(ii) Requirements which the bidder or 
offer must fulfill and all other factors to 
be used in evaluating bids or proposals.

practicable and economically feasible, 
of products and services dimensioned in 
the metric system of measurement. 
(vi) Preference, to the extent 
practicable and economically feasible, 
for products and services that conserve 
natural resources and protect the 
environment and are energy efficient. 
(4) Positive efforts must be made by
