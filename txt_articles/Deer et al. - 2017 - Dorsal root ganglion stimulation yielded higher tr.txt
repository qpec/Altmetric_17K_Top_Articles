Abstract
Animal and human studies indicate that electrical stimulation of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons may modulate neuropathic
pain signals. ACCURATE, a pivotal, prospective, multicenter, randomized comparative effectiveness trial, was conducted in 152
subjects diagnosed with complex regional pain syndrome or causalgia in the lower extremities. Subjects received
neurostimulation of the DRG or dorsal column (spinal cord stimulation, SCS). The primary end point was a composite of
safety and efficacy at 3 months, and subjects were assessed through 12 months for long-term outcomes and adverse events.
The predefined primary composite end point of treatment success was met for subjects with a permanent implant who reported
50% or greater decrease in visual analog scale score from preimplant baseline and who did not report any stimulation-related
neurological deficits. No subjects reported stimulation-related neurological deficits. The percentage of subjects receiving $50%
pain relief and treatment success was greater in the DRG arm (81.2%) than in the SCS arm (55.7%, P , 0.001) at 3 months.
Device-related and serious adverse events were not different between the 2 groups. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation also
demonstrated greater improvements in quality of life and psychological disposition. Finally, subjects using DRG stimulation
reported less postural variation in paresthesia (P , 0.001) and reduced extraneous stimulation in nonpainful areas (P 5 0.014),
indicating DRG stimulation provided more targeted therapy to painful parts of the lower extremities. As the largest prospective,
randomized comparative effectiveness trial to date, the results show that DRG stimulation provided a higher rate of treatment
success with less postural variation in paresthesia intensity compared to SCS.

1. Introduction
The prevalence of neuropathic pain refractory to the current
standard of care has been estimated to be 1.5% of the general
population.26 Spinal cord stimulation (SCS), for which electrodes
are placed into the dorsal epidural space, is an available treatment of
a variety of chronic neuropathic pain conditions such as failed back
surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS).8
Specific challenges for SCS remain, especially for pain
conditions such as CRPS I and causalgia that differ by etiology
and symptom profile from other chronic pain syndromes. An
estimated 40% to 50% of CRPS subjects achieved clinically
meaningful pain relief with SCS.11,14 Similar rates of successful
pain relief are reported for heterogeneous populations that
contain a significant CRPS population.23 Less than optimal

 results for some patients may be due to limitations of the selective
targeting capabilities of SCS, unpleasant paresthesia, or from
different mechanisms of action.
Lack of precision with SCS is attributed to shunting of energy
by the cerebral spinal fluid, positional variations in stimulation,
segmentation of spinal sensory input, and lead migrations
postimplantation.18 In some cases, these challenges can be
addressed with improved surgical techniques and device pro-
gramming, but pain related to CRPS and causalgia remains
difficult to treat; many SCS patients do not achieve high-level pain
relief, despite efforts to improve techniques and programming.14
The dorsal root ganglion (DRG) plays a key role in the
development and maintenance of neuropathic pain.13 The
DRG, located between every spinal nerve and the spinal cord
on the posterior root, houses the somas of the primary sensory
neurons. These somas process and transmit sensory information
from the periphery to the central nervous system. Animal models
of chronic pain have shown that pathophysiologic changes occur
in the DRG, including altered electrophysiological membrane
properties, altered expression of integral membrane proteins, and
altered expression of various genes that contribute to the
hyperexcitability of neurons.15 The combination of the DRG’s
sensory function and accessibility through familiar epidural
approaches make it an ideal target for neurostimulation. Pain
therapies targeting the DRG included radiofrequency frequency
ablation, steroid injections, and ganglionectomy.8
Initial evidence with 8 CRPS patients suggested that DRG
stimulation may besuccessful in a larger proportion of subjects than
SCS (71% vs 50%).28 Thus, the ACCURATE study, a randomized,
controlled, multicenter trial, evaluated DRG stimulation compared
to SCS stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable pain of
the lower limbs attributed to CRPS or causalgia.
2. Methods
Under an Investigational Device Exemption, the ACCURATE
study was designed as a prospective, randomized, controlled,
multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the DRG
stimulation compared to traditional SCS for subjects with CRPS
or causalgia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01923285). The study was
conducted in 22 US sites. Prior to any study initiation, all sites
obtained approval from the institutional review board, and
subjects were enrolled only after informed consent was obtained.
2.1. Patient selection
Subjects who had chronic, intractable neuropathic pain of the
lower limbs associated with a diagnosis of CRPS or causalgia were
screened and determined to be eligible according to the inclusion
or exclusion criteria of the study (Table 1). Patients were diagnosed
with CRPS type 1 based on the Budapest criteria.12 Causalgia was
defined as a painful condition arising from damage to a nerve
resulting in chronic pain, generally restricted to the innervation
pattern of the damaged nerve or nerves, which may or may not
have secondary symptoms.25 The diagnosis, in every case, was
confirmed by an experienced medical monitor (N.M.) for strict
adherence to these diagnostic criteria. Briefly, eligible subjects
were naive to stimulation, had chronic, intractable pain for at least
6 months, tried and failed at least 2 prior pharmacologic treatments
from 2 different drug classes, had stable neurologic function
30 days prior to screening, and were free from psychological
pathology that contraindicated an implantable device. Subjects
with changing or escalating pain condition or unstable use of pain
medication 30 days prior to enrollment were not considered eligible
to participate in the study. All subjects’ medical, psychological, and
imaging records were evaluated by an independent medical
monitor to ensure appropriate patient selection.
2.2. Study design
After signing informed consent, subjects underwent a baseline
evaluation to determine enrollment eligibility. After enrollment,
subjects were randomized to either DRG stimulation (DRG
group) or traditional SCS (SCS group) in a 1:1 ratio. Random-
ization was based on random, permuted blocks and stratified by
study center. The study’s centralized electronic data collection
system provided the subjects’ randomized group assignments
after subjects were enrolled. Subjects, investigators, and study
site staff were not blinded to subjects’ assigned therapy.
Subjects proceeded to a temporary trial stimulation phase
(ranging from 3 to 30 days based on each site’s standard of
care), using the device type stipulated by their randomization.
The average trial stimulation phase in the DRG group was 5.8
(SD 2.8) days and 5.8 (SD 5.1) days for the SCS group (P 5
0.206, Wilcoxon test).
Successful trial stimulation was determined by the subject
achieving at least a 50% lower limb pain relief during the trial
phase and expressing a desire to go on to a permanent implant.
Subjects who were successful during the trial phase were eligible
to continue on to permanent implantation. Subjects who failed
the trial stimulation phase were exited from the study. However,
data from the trial failures were included as treatment failures for
the composite treatment success end point at 3 months and at
subsequent time points through 12 months. Subjects in both
arms, who achieved a successful outcome during the trial phase,
were implanted with a permanent device and were followed for
12 months, with follow-ups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months postimplant.
Subjects were not allowed to change the maximum daily dose of
their prescribed chronic lower limb pain medications from
baseline to the 3-month follow-up visit at which time the primary
and secondary end points were ascertained. Postoperative
reprogramming to optimize therapy was allowed for both groups
at any time during the study, per standard of care for neuro-
modulation devices. Programming occurred by respective
companies (Medtronic and Spinal Modulation) under the guid-
ance of appropriate clinical and technical industry personnel.
2.3. Description of devices and implant procedures
Dorsal root ganglion stimulation was delivered by the AXIUM
Neurostimulator System (Spinal Modulation; LLC, Menlo Park,
CA, a wholly owned subsidiary of St Jude Medical), which was
recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for
spinal column stimulation via epidural and intraspinal lead access
to the DRG as an aid in the management of moderate to severe
chronic intractable pain of the lower limbs in adult patients with
CRPS type I and causalgia. The system is composed of
percutaneous leads designed to stimulate the DRG, an external
trial pulse generator, and an implantable pulse generator.
Traditional SCS was delivered with a commercially available
system (RestoreUltra and RestoreSensor; Medtronic, Minneapolis,
MN) indicated for a number of chronic pain conditions including
CRPS I and causalgia. Both devices were programmed by
separate technicians for each arm such that the programming
was performed by experienced personnel for the specific device
to achieve optimal analgesia. See Table 2 for a summary of
programming parameters used during the study for both devices.

 Standard procedures for trial and permanent implantations
were used in the study. Dorsal root ganglion leads were placed in
the lateral epidural space near the target DRG at levels from T10
to S2, depending on the dermatomal target corresponding to the
subject’s primary region of pain. Spinal cord stimulation leads
were placed in the medial or paramedial epidural space such that
the caudal-most electrical contact was not caudal to the top of
the L1 vertebral body on an anterior–posterior fluoroscopic view.
Depending on the anatomical target, up to 16 contacts were
placed for both study arms. Intraoperative testing to determine
stimulation overlap with subjects’ painful areas was conducted
during implantation. Figure 1 shows the lead placements for both
groups. Table 3 summarizes the number and placement of leads
for subjects in the study.
2.4. Sample size calculation and analysis populations
Sample size was determined based on the planned noninferiority
test for the composite safety and effectiveness primary end point
of treatment success. Treatment success was defined as $50%
reduction in the visual analog scale (VAS) score in the primary
area of pain during both trial and the 3-month visits with no
incidence of stimulation-induced neurological deficits. Pilot data
with 8 CRPS subjects and 22 causalgia subjects indicated that
the success rate of DRG, defined as a 50% reduction in pain
intensity, was 87% for CRPS subjects and 77% for causalgia
subjects. Thus, an observed success rate at of least 15% above
the 50% rate reported for SCS subjects was expected.14,28
Accounting for 15% attrition, an estimated 152 subjects (76
subjects in each arm) would provide greater than 85% power to
test the primary end point hypothesis with a noninferiority margin
of 10%.
The primary, secondary, and tertiary effectiveness analyses
were based on the modified intention-to-treat (MITT) population
including all randomized subjects who participated in the trial
procedure (73 in each group). The MITT population was based on
standard intention-to-treat principles, wherein subjects were
analyzed based on their initial randomized treatments. The binary
composite end points for success included subjects who failed
the trial evaluation and exited the study as treatment failures.

 Safety data tabulations are based on the intention-to-treat
analysis set including all randomized subjects (76 in each group).
2.5. Data collection and general statistical methods
Patient demographics and medical history were collected at
baseline. At baseline and at each study visit, physical and
neurological examinations, along with medication utilization, were
recorded by study staff. Pain intensity was measured at baseline
and at each study visit using the 100-mm visual analog scale
(VAS), ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (worst imaginable pain)
where higher scores represent greater pain severity. At baseline
and each study visit, assessments of quality of life, psychological
disposition, and experiential factors (measures described in detail
below)werecompleted.Alladverseevents(AEs)through12months
were reported and the occurrence of any stimulation-related
neurological deficits was documented.
Descriptive statistics are presented as number of subjects,
mean, SD, median, and range for all continuous variables and the
number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables. As
stipulated by the protocol and with the exception of the primary end
point analysis, DRG stimulation and SCS were compared using
a 2-sample t test (or Wilcoxon rank-sum test) for continuous
outcomes and Pearson x2 test (or Fisher exact test) for categorical
outcomes. Choice of parametric or alternative tests was based on
the data distributions for each measure, and the test used is
reported in the results. Two-sided confidence intervals are also
provided for certain outcome measures of interest to assess
differences between the treatment arm and the control arm.
2.6. Primary composite end point
The predefined primary composite end point of the study was
treatment success rates for the DRG subjects compared to the
SCS subjects. To be considered a treatment success (1) a subject

* Subjects could have up to 4 leads in the DRG group and 2 leads in the SCS group. Leads were placed to
target the subject’s painful areas at one or multiple levels; spinal level categories are not mutually exclusive.
DRG, dorsal root ganglion; SCS, spinal cord stimulation.
Figure 1. Lead placement. The lead for dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation
is specialized to provide percutaneous entry through the epidural space,
exiting through the foramen, and resting around the DRG. As shown in panel A,
DRG leads were placed in the lateral epidural space near the target DRG. For
the SCS arm (panel B), leads were placed in the medial or paramedial epidural
space such that the caudal-most electrical contact was not caudal to the top of
the L1 vertebral body on an anterior–posterior fluoroscopic view. Depending
on the anatomical target, up to 16 contacts were placed for both study arms.
Intraoperative testing to determine paresthesia overlap over pain areas was
conducted during trial evaluation period.

 score at 3 months that was reduced from preimplant baseline by
$50%, and (3) did not experience a stimulation-related neuro-
logical deficit during either the trial phase or after permanent
implant. A stimulation neurological deficit, different from AEs, was
defined as a measurable 2-point worsening on the in-clinic
sensory and motor neurological examination, within the appro-
priate concordant anatomy, that was induced by stimulation and
subsided in the absence of stimulation for at least 24 hours.
Sensory and motor examinations were conducted by the
physician and rated as 2 (normal function), 1 (decreased
function), or 0 (abnormal function); a score of 0 would indicate
neurological deficit. No neurological deficits, as defined, were
recorded for any subjects in either arm of the study. In addition, if
a subject withdrew from the study due to a device-, procedure-,
or stimulation-related AE, the subject was treated as a failure in
the primary end point analysis.
As prespecified, the primary end point analyzed the success
rate between the two treatment arms using Blackwelder
methods for testing noninferiority between 2 proportions at
a one-sided significance of 0.05.3 The noninferiority margin was
set at 10%. If noninferiority of the primary end point was
achieved, a superiority test was performed at a one-sided
significance level of 0.025.
2.7. Secondary end point
2.7.1. Positional effects on paresthesia intensity
Paresthesia intensity, a prespecified secondary end point, was
assessed at 3 months. Paresthesia intensity was rated by subjects
using a previously published paresthesia intensity rating scale.16
Subjects rated the intensity of their perception of paresthesia, while
upright and supine, on an 11-point numeric rating scale from
0 representing “No feeling” to 10 “Very intense.” Perceived
paresthesia intensity difference between supine and upright
positions was calculated and averaged across each group This
end point was evaluated at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05.
2.8. Other end points
2.8.1. Short-Form-36
The Short-Form-36 (SF-36) is a self-reported health-related
quality-of-life scale with 36 questions that yield scores on 8
dimensions of quality of life including physical functioning, role-
physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning,
role-emotional, and mental health.27,29 These 8 dimensions also
are combined to provide 2 summary scales for physical health
(Physical Component Summary) and mental health (Mental
Component Summary). Improvements on the SF-36 scale are
represented by increased scores. Within- and between-group
improvements were examined using the calculated change from
baseline for each subscale or summary scales.
2.8.2. Profile of mood states
The profile of mood states (POMS) scale is a 65-item, 5-point
Likert scale that measures mood states overall (total mood
disturbance) as well as for 6 domains: tension, depression,
anger, vigor, fatigue, and confusion. Higher scores indicate
more negative mood states except for the vigor domain where
higher scores indicate increased vigor.6 Within- and between-
group improvements were examined using the calculated
change from baseline for each domain and the total POMS
score.
2.8.3. Brief pain inventory
The brief pain inventory (BPI) measures pain severity in the last
24 hours on a numeric pain rating scale from 0 “No pain” to
10 “Pain as bad as you can imagine,” and interference due to pain
from 0 “Does not interfere” to 10 “Completely interferes.”5 The
interference score was calculated as the mean of the interference
items, and 2 subscales for the activity dimension and the affective
dimensions of interference were tabulated. Within- and between-
group improvements were examined using the calculated change
from baseline for the pain and interference scales and for each
interference subscale.
2.8.4. Subject satisfaction
Subjects completed a satisfaction scale at the end of trial phase
and at 3, 6, and 12 months. Subjects rated satisfaction with pain
relief and the therapy in general on an 11-point numeric rating
scale with 0 indicating “Not Satisfied” and 10 indicating “Very
Satisfied.” Subjects rated the likelihood of undergoing the therapy
again on an 11-point numeric rating scale with 0 indicating “Not
Likely” and 10 indicating “Very Likely.” Finally subjects rated the
their subjective change in pain since baseline on a 7 point scale
ranging from “Much Worse” to “Much Better.” Ratings were
treated as interval data and summarized with descriptive statistics
of central tendency.
2.8.5. Stimulation specificity
Stimulation specificity was evaluated to determine the extent to
which paresthesia was felt by subjects in anatomical regions that
were not painful at baseline. The pain and paresthesia diagram
forms had identical diagrams of the human body on which
subjects marked where they felt pain and paresthesia. The
baseline pain diagrams completed by the subjects were
compared to the subjects’ paresthesia maps completed at the
end of trial phase and at 3 months postimplant. Subjects were
categorized based on the presence or absence of one or more
paresthesia areas at follow-up that were not coincident with
a pain area at baseline.
2.8.6. Percentage change in visual analog scale
The percentage of change in VAS score from baseline to each
scheduled follow-up was computed for each subject and
inspected using descriptive statistics and confidence intervals.
Missing data were not imputed for this analysis; only subjects with
VAS scores at baseline and follow-up were included in the analysis.
2.9. Safety analysis
Adverse events were collected and tabulated at all scheduled or
unscheduled visits during the study. An AE was defined as any
unfavorable and/or unintended sign, symptom or disease
temporarily associated with the use of the implanted device,
whether or not related to the device. A serious adverse event
(SAE) was defined as any AE that is immediately life threatening;
results in significant, persistent, or permanent disability; neces-
sitates invasive intervention to prevent permanent impairment or
death; results in the need for a 24-hour hospital stay or
prolongation of a hospital stay; or results in death. Adverse event
and SAE rates are expressed as the number of patients divided by
the population at risk for each group (n 5 76) through the
12-month study visit. All AEs reported were reviewed by an

 independent event committee that coded and adjudicated each
event with regard to seriousness and relatedness to the implant
procedure, device, and/or stimulation therapy.
3. Results
3.1. Patient accounting
See CONSORT diagram for full accounting (Fig. 2). Briefly, 320
subjects were consented and enrolled in the study from 22
investigational sites. Of these subjects, 168 were excluded for
screen failures because they failed to meet the study’s inclusion
or exclusion criteria with the majority failing to meet the diagnostic
criteria for inclusion. The remaining 152 subjects were enrolled
and randomized to either the DRG or the SCS arm (76 in each
arm). After randomization, 3 subjects from each group did not
continue to the trial evaluation phase. Subjects who failed the
success criterion at the end of the trial phase were exited from the
study and considered treatment failures for composite end point
analyses. A total of 61 DRG subjects and 54 SCS subjects met
the success criteria at the end of their trial phase and continued to
permanent implant. By the 12-month visit, 55 DRG subjects and
50 SCS subjects had evaluable data.
On average, each active study site randomized 3 subjects
(range 0, 9) to each arm of the study. At any one site, the
maximum number of randomized subjects was 11% (17/152) of
the MITT population.
3.2. Baseline characteristics
The average age of subjects was 52.4 years in the DRG stimulation
arm and 52.5 years in the SCS arm. There were slightly more females
than males in both arms (51.3% for both arms). Race was
predominantly white (94.7% and 92.1% for DRG and SCS,
respectively). Average body mass index was 30.5 for DRG and
28.9 for SCS. The average duration of chronic lower limb pain was
7.5 years for the DRG arm and 6.8 years for the SCS arm.
Comorbidities and medications taken for subject conditions were
similar in both arms. Overall, no statistically significant differences
were found among the baseline characteristics between treatment
arms.SeeTable4fora detailedsummaryofbaseline characteristics.
Similar distribution of CRPS (DRG: 44/76 [57.9%]; SCS: 43/76
[56.6%]) and causalgia (DRG: 32/76 [42.1%]; SCS: 33/76
[43.4%]) was reported between the arms. All CRPS subjects had
sensory symptoms, 82/87 (94.3%) had motor trophic symptoms,
57/87 (65.5%) had vasomotor symptoms, and 58/87 (66.7%) had
sudomotor or edema symptoms. A total of 79 of the 87 CRPS
subjects had at least one symptom in each of 3 symptom categories
documented at baseline; 8 CRPS subjects (3 in the DRG group and 5
in the SCS group) had one symptom ineachof 2symptomcategories
documented at the time of the baseline evaluation (sensory and
motor). In the 8 subjects with only 2 secondary symptoms (sensory
and motor) at enrollment, the medical monitor indicated that the

causalgia the injured nerves are documented in Table 5.
3.3. Primary composite end point
Figure 3 summarizes the primary composite end point results at
3 months, when the primary end point was ascertained, as well as
over time through 12 months. No neurological deficits were
reported during the study, so the rates of success at each time
point include those subjects with a permanent implant who
reported at least a 50% reduction in VAS from preimplant levels.
Randomized subjects who did not proceed to permanent implant
were considered treatment failures for this end point at each study
visit. The proportion of subjects who achieved treatment success
at 3 months in the DRG arm (81.2%; 56/69) was statistically greater
than the SCS arm (55.7%; 39/70). The results demonstrated that
DRG stimulation met not only noninferiority (P , 0.0001) but also
statistical superiority (P , 0.0004). Long term, the proportion of
subjects who achievedtreatmentsuccess at 12 monthsin theDRG
arm (74.2%; 49/66) also was greater than that in the SCS arm
(53.0%; 35/66); theseresults demonstrated both noninferiority (P ,
0.0001) and superiority (P , 0.0004) at the long-term follow-up.
Similar results were observed at 3 months when the primary end
point was stratified by primary diagnoses. For CRPS, a greater
proportion of DRG subjects (82.5%) met the primary end point at
3 months than SCS subjects (57.5%) (noninferiority, P , 0.001;
superiority, P 5 0.006). For causalgia, the proportion of subjects
who met the primary end point was higher for DRG (79.3%) than for
SCS (53.3%) (noninferiority, P 5 0.001; superiority, P 5 0.014).
3.4. Secondary end point
On average, DRG subjects experienced significantly less postural
variation in perceived paresthesia intensity than the SCS subjects
(P , 0.001) at 3 months. Dorsal root ganglion subjects reported
a mean difference between supine and upright paresthesia intensity
rating of 20.1 6 1.6, and SCS subjects had a mean difference of
1.8 6 3.0. These results persisted throughout the study (Fig. 4).
3.5. Other end points
3.5.1. Short-Form-36
Table 6 summarizes the SF-36 results. Both the DRG stimulation
and SCS groups experienced improvements in SF-36 scores
from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05) and 12 months, with the one
exception that the General Health scale was not significantly
improved at 12 months in the SCS group (P . 0.05).
At 3 months, the change in the mental health dimension was
statistically better for DRG stimulation subjects compared to SCS
subjects (P 5 0.0295). At12 months, DRG subjects had statistically
greater improvement on 3 scales: overall change in the physical
component score (P 5 0.04), general health (P 5 0.03), and social
functioning (P 5 0.03) when compared to SCS subjects.
3.5.2. Profile of mood states
Both groups experienced improvements in all domains of the
POMS from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05). At 12 months, DRG
subjects had statistically significant improvements in all scales

 (P , 0.05), and the SCS subjects had statistically significant
improvements (P , 0.05) in all scales except for the depression
and confusion scales compared to baseline.
Figure 5 presents the change in POMS scores through the
12-month visit. The changes in POMS scores from baseline to
3 months were statistically greater for DRG subjects than for SCS
subjects for the Total Mood Disturbance scale (P 5 0.0466) and
the tension domain (P 5 0.0430). Specifically, the Total Mood
Disturbance at 3 months improved by a magnitude of 20.4 points
(29.0 at baseline to 8.6 at 3 months) for DRG subjects, and only
a magnitude of 14.7 points (25.6 at baseline to 10.9 at 3 months)
for SCS subjects. These improvements in the Total Mood
Disturbance and tension domain score for DRG subjects
persisted to 12 months (P 5 0.021 and P 5 0.004, respectively).
In addition, at 12 months, the depression (P 5 0.004) and
confusion (P 5 0.020) domains also demonstrated statistically
greater magnitudes of improvement for DRG subjects compared
to the improvements for SCS subjects.
3.5.3. Brief pain inventory
As shown in Table 7, both groups experienced improvements in
all of the BPI scales from baseline to 3 months (P , 0.05) and
12 months (P , 0.05). Between the 2 groups, improvements from
baseline on the interference scale (treatment 4.2, control 3.0), the
activity scale (treatment 4.5, control 3.4), and the affective scale
(treatment 3.8, control 2.5) were statistically greater (P , 0.05) for
DRG subjects compared to SCS subjects at 3 months. These
results persisted to 12 months.
3.5.4. Subject satisfaction
The majority of patients in both groups reported high degrees of
satisfaction (Table 8) for all 4 satisfaction items. However, no
statistical significance was found between the groups for all items
assessed (P . 0.05).
3.5.5. Stimulation specificity
At 3 months, SCS subjects were 2.3 times more likely to report
feeling paresthesia in one or more nonpainful areas as DRG
subjects (35.2% vs 15.3%, P 5 0.0142). At 12 months postim-
plant, SCS subjects were 7.1 times more likely to report feeling
paresthesia in one or more nonpainful areas as DRG subjects
(38.8% vs 5.5%, P , 0001). The percent of subjects who
reported that they felt paresthesia in only their painful region(s) at
3 and 12 months was 84.7% and 94.5% in the DRG group, and
64.8% and 61.2% in the SCS group.
3.5.6. Percentage change in visual analog scale
As shown in Table 9, DRG stimulation demonstrated a greater
mean percent reduction in VAS scores than SCS (84.1% vs 70.9%,
respectively) with the significant reduction persisting to 6 months
and 12 months. Subjects using DRG reported mean VAS of
80.6 mm at baseline, which reduced to 13.1 mm at 3 months and
remained low, at 15.0 mm, at 12 months. The subjects using SCS
reported a baseline mean VAS of 80.7, 3-month mean VAS of
23.8 mm, and 12-month mean VAS of 26.5 mm.
3.6. Safety analysis
A total of 21 SAEs occurred in 19 subjects (8 DRG subjects and
11 SCS subjects). The rates of SAEs were 10.5% (8/76) in the
DRG arm and 14.5% (11/76) in the SCS arm. The difference in the
rate of SAEs between groups was not statistically different (P 5
0.62). Two of the SAEs in the control group were adjudicated as
definitely related to the implant procedure. Both events were

Table 10 presents the rates of related AEs. Fifty two
procedure-related events were reported by 35 patients (46.1%)
in the DRG arm, and 29 procedure-related events were reported
by 20 patients (26.3%) in the SCS arm, yielding a statistically
significant difference between the groups (P 5 0.018). Possible

The proportion of subjects who met the composite end point of success
defined as 50% or greater pain reduction at both the trial phase and the
indicated follow-up visit without a stimulation-related neurological deficit in the
modified intent-to-treat population is shown. Subjects who exited the study
after randomization were considered treatment failures. At all study visits, the
proportion of subjects in the DRG stimulation group with successful therapy
was noninferior to SCS (Blackwelder test of 2 proportions, all P , 0.01).

 contributors to the differential rate of procedure-related AEs are
the procedure times and number of leads. Procedure times for
permanent implant averaged 107.2 minutes (651.2) for DRG
subjects and 75.7 minutes (632.2) for SCS subjects. In addition,
16.4% (10/61) of DRG subjects were implanted with 3 or 4 leads,
while all SCS subjects had 1 or 2 leads implanted. For both
groups, the most frequently occurring procedure-related AE was
pain at the incision sites with 7 events reported by 6 patients
(7.9%) in the DRG arm and 5 events reported by 5 patients (6.6%)
in the SCS arm.
For device-related AEs, 39 events were reported by 28 patients
(36.8%) in the DRG arm and 24 events were reported by 20
patients (26.3%) in the SCS arm. No statistical difference was
found between the groups (P 5 0.22). The most frequently
occurring device-related AE in the DRG arm was implantable pulse
generator (IPG) pocket pain with 10 events reported by 10 patients
(13.2%). On the other hand, the most frequently occurring device-
related AE in the SCS arm was loss of stimulation due to lead
migration with 8 events reported by 8 (10.5%) patients.
There was also no statistical difference between the groups for
stimulation-related AEs (P 5 0.8025). Ten events were reported by
8 patients (10.5%) in the DRG arm, and 10 events were reported by
10 patients (13.2%) in the SCS arm. The most frequently occurring
stimulation-related AE for both groups was overstimulation with 3
events reported by 3 patients (3.9%) in the DRG arm and 5 events
reported by 5 patients (6.6%) in the SCS arm.

 4. Discussion
This study represents the largest randomized controlled trial
assessing DRG stimulation for the treatment of chronic, intractable
painassociatedwiththe diagnosesof CRPSorcausalgia.Analysis of
the primary end point revealed that subjects using DRG stimulation
had a higher rate of treatment success (81.2%) compared with the
treatment success rate for traditional SCS (56.7%). Furthermore,
pain relief persisted through 12 months of follow-up and remained
significantly lower for DRG subjects than for those using SCS.
Subjects using DRG reported significantly less postural-related
changes in paresthesia and showed larger improvements on
measures of quality of life, functional status, and psychological
disposition than subjects using SCS. The safety profile of the DRG
stimulation device was similar to traditional SCS devices, with the
exception of the rate of procedural events.
These results for DRG stimulation as a treatment of chronic
neuropathic pain associated with CRPS and causalgia must be
interpreted within the context of previous neurostimulation studies
for this population. Treatment of chronic reflex sympathetic
dystrophy with SCS,in combination with physical therapy, reduced
pain to a greater degree than physical therapy alone14; mean VAS
scores for implanted patients reduced to 3.5 cm on a 10-cm VAS
scale after 6 months of SCS. A retrospective analysis of SCS for the
treatment of CRPS reported a mean VAS of 5.6 cm over a mean
follow-up time of 88 months.19 Mean VAS scores during SCS
therapy in both these previous studies were higher, by a clinically
meaningful margin10 than the VAS score of 13.1 mm and 15 mm
reported by subjects treated with DRG stimulation in our study at 3
and 12 months. Similarly, Geurts et al.11 reported only a 50% pain
reduction in an observational trial of SCS for CRPS.

 A study using a heterogeneous population, including
subjects with CRPS, reported that 68.4% of subjects were
able to achieve $50% leg pain relief, and 60% of subjects
achieved $50% pain relief for overall pain.21 A published case
series of CRPS subjects reported that 71.4% of subjects
achieved $50% pain relief after 6 months of DRG stimula-
tion.28 In addition, a randomized trial comparing SCS to
physical therapy for subjects with CRPS reported that 50% of
subjects achieved at least 50% reduction in pain intensity.14
Here, we report an 84% reduction in pain for patients treated
with DRG stimulation and that 81% of subjects achieved
$50% pain relief. Furthermore, the optimal programming for
DRG stimulation is still being developed; Table 2 shows that
SCS and DRG parameters were quite different. Additional
developments in optimized programming for DRG should
improve clinical outcomes over time for this therapy. Taken
together, we conclude that DRG stimulation provides better
pain relief than traditional SCS.
Patients with CRPS and causalgia are difficult to treat with
symptoms for 20% to 80% of CRPS I patients persisting for
1 year, even when treatment was considered successful.2 Surgical
interventions such as joint denervation or neurolysis also have
variable outcomes; approximately 20% of patients failed to report
low pain intensity and improved activities of daily living 2 years after
surgery.9 For patients with CRPS I or causalgia who do not achieve
adequate pain management with conservative therapies, SCS
provides an additional and reversible treatment option. Further-
more, DRG stimulation augments the patient experience by

 providing a therapy that is adaptable to each patient’s individual
pain profile through more precise anatomical targeting.
The pathways for sensory afferents into the central nervous
system via the DRG are well documented.4,13 Anatomically,
peripheral inputs associated with pain symptoms can be traced
to relevant DRG at one or more spinal levels. Stimulation of the
relevant DRG modifies pain signaling from the periphery for only
the affected dermatomes. By contrast, SCS targets large
dermatomal areas through stimulation of the dorsal column at
anatomically defined spinal levels, and, as such, modifies
ascending pathways for pain while also modulating collateral
afferents in or near the medial lemniscus. Modulating pain signals
from distal appendages with SCS typically requires that multiple
dermatomes be captured–with paresthesias in the entire region.
Our results showed that subjects treated with DRG stimulation
had significantly less perceived stimulation sensation in nonpainful
areas than subjects using SCS, while reporting better pain relief.
This may indicate more precision targeting by virtue of the greater
anatomical specificity with DRG stimulation.
The differences in collateral paresthesia may also be influenced
by differences in programming parameters. Programming param-
eters were individualized for each subject’s optimal experience.
The resulting parameters were quite different between the
2 therapies (Table 2) with much lower amplitudes for DRG
programming. This was expected from pilot work7 and because
diffusion of energy by the cerebrospinal fluid is less influential at the
DRG. The between-subjects design of this study prohibits a real
comparison of the relationship between targeting, programming,
and pain relief; more research is needed.
Chronic pain conditions, in general, are associated with
disturbances in mood and physical and social functioning.1,22,24
The targeted pain relief provided by DRG stimulation in the
ACCURATE study was also associated with additional benefits.
After 3 months, subjects using DRG stimulation reported
significantly greater improvements in total mood disturbance,
as measured by the POMS, as well as larger improvements pain
interference, affective disruption, and activity, as measured by the
BPI. Moreover, by 12 months, subjects treated with DRG
stimulation reported significantly larger improvements than SCS
subjects for physical function, general health, and social function,
as measured by the SF-36.
Despite the differences reported for treatment success, pain
relief, and affective or functional outcomes, the majority of subjects
were satisfied with their respective therapy, regardless of treatment
group. While subjects using DRG stimulation reported a larger
magnitude of change and there was a greater proportion of
successfulsubjectswithDRGstimulation,SCSsubjects,asagroup,
did report significant improvements from baseline in all measured
domains. The satisfaction results reported here reflect the improve-
ments from preimplant baseline experienced by subjects.
The rate of AEs for DRG stimulation, through 12 months
postimplant, was similar to that seen for the SCS-treated subjects
in this study and in previous reports.17,20 Only 2 subjects had
procedure-related SAEs; 2 infections in the SCS group that
required explant. It is notable that the rate of nonserious
procedure-related events was higher for the DRG stimulation
group (46%) compared with the SCS group (26%). The higher
rate of procedure-related events may be attributed to the
differences in average procedure time and a greater number of
leads placed for DRG some subjects, which may increase
exposure to risk. It is expected that additional experience with
DRG implantation will result in shorter procedure times and fewer
procedure-related events.
There are limitations to this study that may affect the
interpretation of the results. The calculated success rate was
contingent upon subjects not only achieving 50% pain relief but
also continuing in the study (dropouts were counted as failures).
Therefore, the success rate could be influenced by factors
associated with the lack of blinded treatments (eg, SCS subjects
were less motivated to stay in the trial, uncontrolled differences in
health care provider interactions). In addition, subjects were
required to maintain a stable regimen of pain medications through
3 months only, and the long-term results after 3 months may be
affected by medication changes. The SCS device also had
limitations placed on the programming of the device so that the
comparison between the devices was not confounded by unique
SCS device programming features. In particular, the accelerom-
eter function in the SCS device was disabled. If the accelerometer
was enabled, the SCS group may have had less postural changes
in perceived paresthesia intensity. In addition, the analysis of
subjects who did and did not experience paresthesia when
stimulation was on was confounded by the fact that the SCS
device instruction for use requires the device to be programmed
for subjects to receive paresthesia. In addition, the number of
subjects who did not have paresthesia is very small, and this end
point was not adequately powered to detect the difference in pain
relief for subjects who reported feeling vs not feeling paresthesia.
In conclusion, CRPS I and causalgia, in their chronic forms, are
difficult to treat with variable outcomes with conservative
symptom
management.
Neuromodulation
techniques,
like
SCS, may benefit many patients who have exhausted other
therapy options. SCS, however, often has a limited ability to target
discrete focal anatomical regions of pain, as is common in CRPS
and causalgia. Dorsal root ganglion stimulation provides an
effective alternative that provides precision stimulation targeting
and improved patient outcomes.
