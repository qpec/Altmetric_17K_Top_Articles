ABSTRACT
Background: Choline status has been associated with stunting among
young children. Findings from this study showed that an egg interven-
tion improved linear growth by a length-for-age z score of 0.63.
Objective: We aimed to test the efficacy of eggs introduced early in
complementary feeding on plasma concentrations of biomarkers in
choline pathways, vitamins B-12 and A, and essential fatty acids.
Design: A randomized controlled trial, the Lulun (“egg” in Kichwa)
Project, was conducted in a rural indigenous population of Ecuador.
Infants aged 6–9 mo were randomly assigned to treatment (1 egg/d
for 6 mo; n = 80) and control (no intervention; n = 83) groups.
Socioeconomic data, anthropometric measures, and blood samples
were collected at baseline and endline. Household visits were made
weekly for morbidity surveillance. We tested vitamin B-12 plasma
concentrations by using chemiluminescent competitive immunoas-
say and plasma concentrations of choline, betaine, dimethylglycine,
retinol, essential fatty acids, methionine, dimethylamine (DMA),
trimethylamine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) with the
use of liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry.
Results: Socioeconomic factors and biomarker concentrations were
comparable at baseline. Of infants, 11.4% were vitamin B-12 de-
ficient and 31.7% marginally deficient at baseline. In adjusted gen-
eralized linear regression modeling, the egg intervention increased
plasma concentrations compared with control by the following ef-
fect sizes: choline, 0.35 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.57); betaine, 0.29 (95% CI:
0.01, 0.58); methionine, 0.31 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.60); docosahexaenoic
acid, 0.43 (95% CI: 0.13, 0.73); DMA, 0.37 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.69);
and TMAO, 0.33 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.58). No significant group differ-
ences were found for vitamin B-12, retinol, linoleic acid (LA), a-
linolenic acid (ALA), or ratios of betaine to choline and LA to ALA.
Conclusion: The findings supported our hypothesis that early
introduction of eggs significantly improved choline and other
markers in its methyl group metabolism pathway. This trial
was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02446873.

INTRODUCTION
Multiple biological pathways influence early growth and de-
velopment and depend on the adequate intake and metabolism of
essential nutrients during infancy and early childhood. Choline is
necessary for the production of phospholipids, cell membrane
integrity, and in the conversion of acetylcholine and sphingomyelin
in brain development and function. Alternatively, choline may be
converted to betaine, which plays a crucial role as a methyl donor,
converting homocysteine to methionine in remethylation pathways.
This leads to the production of S-adenosylmethionine, enabling
substrate methylation (DNA, RNA, proteins, and lipids) (1). In the
gut, choline may be converted by the gut microbes into trime-
thylamine (TMA), which is then readily absorbed and converted
into trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) in the liver (2). TMAO has
been implicated as a cardiovascular disease risk factor in adults,
although its importance in infant and child health is unknown (3).
Like milk or seeds, eggs holistically support the early growth
and development of an organism and are, therefore, dense in
nutrient content. They are among the richest sources of choline
and other important macro- and micronutrients necessary for
growth (4, 5). Similar to other animal-source foods, eggs provide
All phases of this trial were supported by The Mathile Institute for the

 vitamin B-12 and have been shown to provide essential fatty acids
including DHA (22:6n–3) (6–8). Current evidence, primarily
from upper-income countries, shows that eggs introduced during
infancy neither increase allergy incidence risk or egg sensiti-
zation (9–11). We hypothesized that by introducing eggs early in
the complementary feeding period in a setting of high back-
ground stunting there would be important growth and nutrition
benefits.
The Lulun Project, a randomized controlled trial (RCT)
conducted in a mixed-indigenous rural Andean community of
Ecuador, aimed to test the efficacy of eggs given early in the
complementary feeding period on improved nutrition biomarkers
and growth outcomes. We recently reported findings from a study
that showed that eggs increased linear growth by a length-for-age
z score of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.88) and reduced stunting by
47% (prevalence ratio: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.77) (12). We hy-
pothesized that the intervention of 1 egg/d for 6 mo would
significantly increase choline, vitamin B-12, and essential fatty
acid biomarkers.
METHODS
Study design and participants
Details of the study design and methods are described else-
where (12). In brief, this was an RCT with a parallel design and a
1:1 ratio of intervention to controls. The study was conducted in
Cotopaxi Province, Ecuador, a rural region with w457,000
residents, of whom 22% identified as indigenous in the last
census (13). Mother (caregiver)-infant pairs were recruited
over a 5-mo period by a field team from Universidad San
Francisco de Quito (USFQ). Eligibility criteria were as follows:
infant aged 6–9 mo, singleton birth, and healthy without fever, a
congenital heart condition, severe malnutrition, or egg allergy.
Written informed consent was obtained from mothers or care-
givers before baseline data collection.
Ethics approval was obtained from participating institutions,
including USFQ, Washington University in St. Louis, and the Pan
American Health Organization in Washington, DC. The trial is
registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT02446873.
Randomization, procedures, and intervention
Community meetings were first held to discuss the Lulun
(“egg” in Kichwa) Project and begin recruitment. Groups of 8–
10 potentially eligible mother (caregiver)-pairs were then gath-
ered at temporary data collection points. After the informed
consent process, the pairs were randomly assigned to the in-
tervention or control groups. Mothers or other caregivers were
shown the forms, labeled “alpha” and “beta,” which were then
hidden and sealed and placed in a container. Each participant
then drew a form for group assignment. The egg intervention
precluded blinding participants and study enrollment and sur-
veillance teams, who monitored participants in both groups
throughout the trial for morbidities. Data collection staff, who
measured child anthropometric variables and dietary intake,
laboratory staff, and data analysts were blinded to group
assignment.
The intervention consisted of 1 egg/d for a 6-mo period, de-
livered weekly in batches of 7 eggs. Weekly surveillance visits
were made to both the intervention and control groups to collect
information about morbidities and to make referrals to local
health care facilities in the case of a seriously ill child. For the
intervention group, surveillance team members also recorded
information in a log report about egg consumption by the child
and any complications associated with egg consumption. A 24-h
frequency of dietary intake measure, including eggs, was
conducted in both groups at baseline and endline. Eggs were
reported to be consumed in the control group for 45% and 60%
of children and in the intervention group for 40% and 91% of
children at baseline and endline, respectively (12). Social
marketing activities, including messaging at data collection
sites, workshops, and sporting and entertainment activities,
were directed to all participants to encourage participation and
compliance.
Eggs were procured from 5 small-to-medium-size poultry
farms in the surrounding areas. The poultry feeds contained corn,
soy, wheat bran, rice powder, palm oil, and molasses, among
other ingredients with comparable nutrient content. The nutrient
content of a sample of 9 eggs sourced from 1 study supplier was
tested by Eurofins Scientific Nutrition Analysis Center (Des
Moines, Iowa) in April 2016. The eggs were hard-boiled and
refrigerated before being transported to the United States for
testing. Elemental and nutritional testing was completed on
eggs and focused on those being examined as biomarkers in
the children, with additional nutrients added beyond standard
profiles.
Primary outcomes
The primary outcomes were changes in plasma concentrations
of nutrient biomarkers, including choline, betaine, dimethyl-
glycine (DMG), and linoleic acid (LA; 18:2n–6), a-linolenic acid
(ALA; 18:3n–3), and DHA, and child-growth anthropometric
measures. These outcome measures were collected at baseline
and at endline follow-up at 6 mo. Anthropometric measures of
length and weight and conversion to z scores are described
elsewhere (12). Surveys were also administered to mothers
(caregivers) for socioeconomic, demographic, and child dietary
intake and morbidity information.
NETLAB, a reference laboratory located in Quito, Ecuador,
was responsible for collecting, processing, and storing the blood
samples during the trial and for the vitamin B-12 analyses. This
facility regularly collaborates with USFQ and was responsible for
all nutrient biomarkers in a recent national nutrition survey,
Encuesta Nacional de Salud y Nutrici´
on (ENSANUT-ECU) 2012
(14). Trained phlebotomists from NETLAB accompanied the
Lulun study team to data collection sites. A total of 3 mL of
blood was collected from each child. Blood was separated into
aliquots at the field site into different tubes containing differ-
ent anticoagulants based on the intended assays: lithium heparin
for the choline markers and fatty acids and EDTA for vitamin
B-12. Tubes were shielded from light, placed on ice, and
transported back to the NETLAB facility in Quito. Samples
were centrifuged at 500 3 g for 10 min at 48C; vials with plasma
were then stored in a NETLAB freezer at 2808C. At the close of
the study, the samples intended for analyses of choline-
related markers and fatty acids for were packed in dry ice
and shipped to the Metabolomics Laboratory at Washington
University in St. Louis.

 Laboratory methods
Vitamin B-12 plasma concentrations were assessed by using
chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay (IMMULITE 1000
Analyzer; Diagnostic Products). Both internal and external
quality controls were carried out. When values were outside ac-
ceptable ranges, we conducted duplicates. The CVof the internal
control was 8.14% and total error was 20.9%, both in range of
minimal biological variation (11.3% and 45.04%, respectively)
during the run of all the samples.
For the choline, betaine, DMG, methionine, dimethylamine
(DMA), TMA, TMAO, retinol, and fatty acid measures, we used
modified liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) methods (15–19). Sample analysis was performed
with a 20AD HPLC system (Shimadzu), coupled to a triple
quadrupole mass spectrometer (4000 QTRAP; AB Sciex) op-
erated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The positive ion
electrospray ionization mode was used. Retinol and DMA were
analyzed on an API 4000 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex) coupled
with a Prominence LC-20AD HPLC system (Shimadzu). For
details about instrument parameters for LC-MS/MS analysis of
biomarkers and their internal standards, see Supplemental
Table 1.
Protein precipitation was first performed to extract choline,
betaine, DMG, free methionine, fatty acids, TMAO, TMA, and
DMA from human plasma. Deuterated d3-betaine, d9-choline,
d6-DMG, d3-Met, d4-LA, d5-ALA, d5-DHA, d9-TMAO, d6-DMA,
and d6-retinol were used as internal standards and were added to
the samples before extraction. The resulting extracts were divided
into 2 parts. One part was used for the analysis of choline, be-
taine, and DMG. The other part was further processed to the
amino-methylphenylpyridium derivative to increase the mass
spectrometry sensitivity and selectivity of LA, ALA, and DHA.
The 6- to 11-point calibration standards of all of the analytes
containing respective deuterated internal standards were also
prepared for absolute quantification. For the DMA assay, the
samples were derivatized with pyridine-3-sulfonyl chloride to
improve detection sensitivity. The TMA in the samples was oxi-
dized to TMAO with meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid and calcu-
lated from pre- and postoxidized TMAO values. Data processing
was conducted with Analyst 1.5.1 (Applied Biosystems).
Statistical analysis
Sample size was estimated on the basis of hypothesized change
(difference-in-difference with control) in plasma vitamin B-12
concentration of 59.4 pmol/L over the 6-mo intervention period
and on other previous findings of vitamin B-12 supplementation
and the variability in vitamin B-12 status among infants (20, 21).
This nutrient was selected for sample size calculation because
sufficient data were available to estimate variability and potential
effects from egg consumption in contrast to the other nutrients
studied. Assuming a 20% attrition rate, we estimated the re-
quirement of 90 children/group with the use of estimates for
2 samples with repeated measures (a = 0.05, 1 2 b = 0.80).
Intention-to-treat analyses were applied for all inference
analyses. When a biomarker distribution was not normally
distributed, a natural-log transformation was performed. For
bivariate statistics, we applied Wilcoxon’s (Mann-Whitney) test.
Generalized linear regression modeling was applied for multivariate
analyses of difference-in-difference effects of eggs on nutrient
biomarkers. Low outliers were truncated to the value of the 2.5th
percentile and high outliers were truncated to the value of the
97.5th percentile. Unadjusted and adjusted models included the
corresponding baseline nutrient biomarker to avoid type I error
(22). Adjusted models additionally adjusted for age of the child,
sex of the child, and stunting status at baseline. The Benjamini-
Hochberg method was used to adjust for multiple comparisons
(23). Data analyses were performed with STATA software (version
13.1; StataCorp) and SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Analytics).
RESULTS
Of the 175 mother (caregiver)-infant pairs assessed for eli-
gibility, 4 did not meet the inclusion criteria and 8 declined to
participate due to blood draw concerns, logistical challenges, or
unknown reasons (12). A total of 163 infants were randomly
assigned to the control (n = 83) and intervention (n = 80) groups
(Figure 1). We were not able to collect a sufficient quantity of
blood for all children at both time points. The numbers differed
slightly due to the aliquot procedure that occurred in the field,
filling first the tubes for the vitamin B-12 assay for analysis at
NETLAB, followed by tubes for analyses with LC-MS/MS at
the Washington University Metabolomics Facility, including all
other biomarkers from this study.
Baseline socioeconomic factors in the children included in this
biomarker analyses were comparable. As reported previously,
baseline stunting, underweight, and wasting prevalence was
significantly higher in the intervention group (12). Due to the high
correlation among these markers, we selected only baseline
stunting, which affected a higher proportion of children and was a
primary outcome in the study, to include in all of the adjusted
regression models.
The eggs used in the study, on average, provided .50% of
daily infant (ages 8–13 mo) Recommended Dietary Allowance
requirements for protein, vitamin B-12, and selenium (Table 1)
(24). The choline content of individual eggs exceeded infant
requirements by 29%. Comparisons of the study eggs with re-
ported nutrient-composition values for eggs in the USDA data-
base showed many similarities, with a few notable differences
(25). Eggs reported in the USDA database were more highly
concentrated in vitamins A and B-12 and folate than those used
in the study, whereas concentrations of betaine, vitamin E, and
calcium were higher in the study eggs.
Plasma concentrations of biomarkers did not differ by study
group at baseline (Table 2). There was a general trend for de-
creasing choline concentrations from baseline to endline, which
was buffered by the egg intervention. In addition, all of the es-
sential fatty acids showed decreasing trends with age. At baseline,
11.4% of infants were vitamin B-12 deficient (,150 pmol/L) and
31.7% were marginally deficient (150–220 pmol/L). The preva-
lence of vitamin B-12 deficiency increased for both groups by
endline: 15.4% of children were vitamin B-12 deficient and 43.6%
of children were marginally deficient. No children were found to
be vitamin A deficient (retinol concentration ,0.7 mmol/L) at
baseline or at endline, and only a small fraction were marginally
deficient (retinol concentration ,1.05 mmol/L) at baseline
(3.1%) and at endline (0.7%).
Although decreases in concentrations of some nutrients were
observed longitudinally for children across groups, the egg

 intervention reduced this effect for choline and DHA. In adjusted
regression modeling, the egg intervention significantly increased
plasma concentrations of choline, betaine, methionine, DHA,
TMAO, and DMA compared with those in the control group
(Table 2). After adjustment for multiple comparisons, choline,
DHA, TMAO, and DMA remained significant. No group effect
was found for DMG, vitamin B-12, retinol, LA, ALA, TMA, or
the ratios of betaine to choline and LA to ALA.
DISCUSSION
In this 6-mo intervention trial in which 1 egg was provided
daily early in the complementary feeding period, we found ef-
fects on choline and other biomarkers suggestive of effects in the
choline methyl metabolism pathway. Concentrations of choline at
endline were 2.00 and 1.78 mg/mL in the egg and control groups,
respectively, which translated into an effect size of 0.35 when
controlling for baseline choline, child age, sex, and stunting
status. DHA concentrations at endline were 1.32 and 1.14 mg/mL
in the egg and control groups, respectively. This corresponded to
an adjusted effect size of 0.43 between groups. Although no effect
on vitamin B-12 was detected from the egg intervention, 43.1% of
the children were found to be marginal or deficient in the vitamin
by the end of the trial.
We hypothesized an effect on choline nutrition, on the basis of
the relatively high content of the nutrient found in eggs than in
other foods (1). Choline is necessary for several critical pathways
in growth and development, including the conversion to acetyl-
choline, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin. In this analysis,
we focused on the one-carbon metabolism cycle, including be-
taine, DMG, methionine, and vitamin B-12 (26). This pathway is
ultimately important for gene expression, because betaine con-
verts to DMG, enabling the production of methionine from
homocysteine and S-adenosylmethionine, which, in turn, donate
methyl groups to methylate DNA (27). Our findings for signif-
icant increases in choline, betaine, and methionine concentra-
tions in the egg group compared with the control group suggest
that these pathways were affected either through changes in
ratios or increased concentrations of the metabolites. There may
have been an effect on concentrations of homocysteine in this
pathway as well, but this metabolite was not measured. Methi-
onine, an essential amino acid, is important during early de-
velopment due to high demands for transmethylation and protein
synthesis (28). Previous studies have shown a positive correlation

treatment group (1 egg/d for 6 mo) or to a control group (no intervention). Socioeconomic data, anthropometric measures, and blood samples were collected
at baseline and at endline, and weekly household visits were made for morbidity surveillance. Vitamin B-12 plasma concentrations were tested by using
chemiluminescent competitive immunoassay; plasma concentrations of choline, betaine, dimethylglycine, methionine, retinol, linoleic acid, a-linolenic acid,
DHA, TMAO, TMA, and DMA were tested by using LC-MS/MS. DMA, dimethylamine; LC-MS/MS, liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry;

 between these biomarkers in young children (29). Interestingly,
we observed no change in the betaine-to-choline ratio by group,
which suggests a possible regulation of the proportionality of
these metabolites regardless of intake or plasma concentration.
Recent attention has focused on the potential contribution of
choline to linear growth promotion. One observational study
showed that higher concentrations of serum choline were asso-
ciated with a lower prevalence of stunting among young children
aged 12–59 mo in Malawi (30). We previously reported that the
egg intervention in the Lulun Project had a significant effect on
increasing linear growth by a length-for-age z score of 0.63 and
reducing stunting by 47% (12). However, our analyses showed
only a partial mediating effect by choline. There may be con-
textual factors such as differences in the overall diet that in-
fluence the contribution of choline to growth. In our view, it
likely reflects the importance of multiple other nutrients and
bioactive factors converging to influence linear growth during
infancy.
We found that there was a significant increase in TMAO
concentrations in the egg intervention group, which may be
related to choline nutrition. Choline is converted by the gut
microbes into TMA, which is then absorbed and converted into
TMAO in the liver (2). TMAO can be converted into DMA and is
excreted in urine. A number of studies have reported postprandial
increases in plasma TMAO concentrations after the ingestion of
eggs (31–33), although one study reported no increase in fasting
TMAO concentrations (34). TMAO has been implicated as a risk
factor for the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular
disease in adults (34); however, it is unclear whether elevated
TMAO concentrations are of concern in early childhood. In the
study in Malawian children described above, stunted children
had higher TMAO-to-choline ratios than did nonstunted chil-
dren (30); however, this appeared to be due to their lower
choline concentrations rather than due to a difference in TMAO
concentrations.
We measured 3 essential fatty acids in this study and found that
eggs significantly increased plasma concentrations of DHA
compared with controls, with a relatively large effect size of 0.43.
It is widely established that DHA is crucial in neurodevelopment
and growth, yet is lacking in the diets of young children in
resource-poor settings (35, 36). During pregnancy and early
childhood, there is rapid accretion of DHA in the brain and retinal
tissue (37), with clear evidence of the importance of DHA to
neurogenesis, neurotransmission, myelination, and synaptic
plasticity, among other functions (38). We identified only one
intervention study from a low- and middle-income country that
examined fatty acid biomarker outcomes (39). The study con-
ducted in the Gambia tested supplementation with DHA and EPA
of infants aged 3–9 mo and found increased plasma n–3 fatty
acid concentrations and midupper arm circumference at 9 mo,
but no other growth or development effects. This trial in the
Gambia showed higher DHA concentrations at baseline than
our population of infants, and a small effect with supplemen-
tation, which investigators attributed to the high breast-milk

1 Results with the use of generalized linear regression modeling for unadjusted and adjusted effect sizes, by group, are shown. Effect size = mean difference/SD of the pooled data. ALA, a-linolenic acid;
BH-P, Benjamini-Hochberg P value; DMA, dimethylamine; DMG, dimethylglycine; LA, linoleic acid; TMA, trimethylamine; TMAO, trimethylamine-N-oxide.
2 Values for methionine, TMAO, TMA, DMA, vitamin B-12, DHA, ALA, LA, betaine, choline, and DMG are geometric means (95% CIs); data were skewed. Values for retinol are means (95% CIs). All
biomarker values are geometric means converted to log-normal distributions, except for retinol concentrations, which are presented as means.
3 Adjusted for corresponding baseline biomarker value.
4 Adjusted for child age, child sex, baseline stunting status, and corresponding baseline biomarker value.
5 Adjusted to account for multiple comparisons.
6 Available aliquots for vitamin B-12 analyses were for n = 81 and 78 in the baseline control and egg groups, respectively, and for n = 72 and 74 in the endline control and egg groups, respectively.

 concentrations of DHA in the population (39). The difference in
DHA concentrations compared with our values may also be due
to the metabolite measured; in the Gambia study, it was total
DHA including free DHA and esterified DHA, whereas our
values reflect only free DHA. To our knowledge, there are no
validated reference ranges for plasma concentrations of DHA or
other fatty acids in healthy populations of infants and young
children to enable comparison with the Lulun Project children (40).
In this study, we also examined the change in median ratios for
LA to ALA, which are important for conversion to long-chain
fatty acids, and found no effect from the intervention. This ef-
fect, however, was not anticipated given the high ratio of n–6 to
n–3 fatty acids in eggs compared with other foods (4). Boiled
eggs (Table 1) contain DHA concentrations comparable to
poultry meat (0.04 g/100 g), although higher than in animal milk
or beef, but less than in fish such as herring (1.10 g/100 g) (25).
The significant increase in DHA in the egg group could explain
the growth effect we observed in this trial and potentially signify
important contributions to brain development.
The prevalence of marginal or deficient vitamin B-12 at
baseline among the Lulun Project infants (43.1%) was compa-
rable to that in a sample of children aged 6–30 mo in India, but
lower than in Guatemalan infants aged 12 mo (49%) (20, 21).
We hypothesized that eggs, as an animal-source food, would
improve vitamin B-12 status of infants in the intervention group.
However, we observed no effect of the intervention on vitamin
B-12 concentrations. Vitamin B-12 stores in both the children
and breastfeeding mothers may have been sufficiently depleted
to preclude improvement over 6 mo (41). Eggs have been shown
to have lower bioavailability of vitamin B-12 relative to other
animal-source foods (42). The prevalence of vitamin A de-
ficiency was negligible. The national survey, ENSANUT-ECU,
found 28.5% of children aged 6–11 mo and 16.2% of children
aged 12–23 mo to be vitamin A deficient (serum retinol
,20 mg/dL) (14). We did not hypothesize an effect of eggs on
vitamin A because the content of vitamin A retinol activity
equivalents in eggs is only w11% of the Dietary Reference
Intake for this age group (Table 1).
Some limitations are present in this study. We were initially
restricted with regard to the breadth of biomarkers explored due
to funding limitations. To characterize the pathways affected by
egg nutrition more fully, additional metabolites may be required,
including amino acids, phosphatidylcholines, and other micro-
nutrients, as well as bioactive compounds, such as insulin-like
growth factor I (IGF-I). We may have also been limited by the
sample size. In addition, there may have been limitations in the
testing of the Lulun eggs for nutrient concentrations. Nutrient
values were mostly comparable to USDA-tested egg concen-
trations, but there were some differences. For example, betaine
concentration was markedly higher in the Lulun eggs. This may
have been due to differences in poultry feed or possibly due to
limitations in the long transit time to testing the eggs in the Iowa-
based laboratory.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the effect of
an egg intervention early in the complementary feeding period on
nutrition biomarkers, specifically choline and related metabo-
lites, through an RCT. We hypothesized that the egg food matrix
would deliver essential nutrients and other factors in a bio-
available manner. The Lulun Project showed important findings
for increased linear growth and reduced stunting in young
children, offering a unique opportunity to understand potential
metabolic pathways that contribute to these effects. The egg
intervention significantly increased choline, betaine, methionine,
TMAO, DMA, and DHA concentrations. More exploration is
needed to better elucidate the multiple other pathways that
contribute to healthy growth and development of young children
in resource-poor settings.
