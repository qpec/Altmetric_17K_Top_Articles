AbsTRACT
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a complex and 
heterogeneous autoimmune disease, represents 
a significant challenge for both diagnosis and 
treatment. Patients with SLE in Latin America face 
special problems that should be considered when 
therapeutic guidelines are developed. The objective of 
the study is to develop clinical practice guidelines for 
Latin American patients with lupus. Two independent 
teams (rheumatologists with experience in lupus 
management and methodologists) had an initial 
meeting in Panama City, Panama, in April 2016. 
They selected a list of questions for the clinical 
problems most commonly seen in Latin American 
patients with SLE. These were addressed with 
the best available evidence and summarised in a

Recommendation
box 1 GLADEL–PANLAR Latin American guidelines for the 
treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus
Overarching principles
a. Treatment should be individualised, specialists and generalists 
should work together and the active involvement of patients 
and their family members on the overall therapeutic plan 
should be emphasised.
b. The therapeutic goal should be to reach and maintain 
remission or low-disease activity as soon as the diagnosis is 
made and for as long as possible.
c. Treatment should include photo-protection, osteoporosis, 
cardiovascular, metabolic syndrome and infection prevention, 
psychological support and pregnancy counselling.
d. All patients with lupus should receive AMs, except those who 
refuse them or who have absolute contraindications to take 
them.
e. GCs, if clinically needed, regardless of patient’s disease 
manifestations, should be prescribed at the lowest possible 
dose and for the shortest period of time.

standardised format following the Grading of Recommendations 
Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. All preliminary 
findings were discussed in a second face-to-face meeting in 
Washington, DC, in November 2016. As a result, nine organ/system 
sections are presented with the main findings; an ’overarching’ 
treatment approach was added. Special emphasis was made on 
regional implementation issues. Best pharmacologic options were 
examined for musculoskeletal, mucocutaneous, kidney, cardiac, 
pulmonary, neuropsychiatric, haematological manifestations and the 
antiphospholipid syndrome. The roles of main therapeutic options 
(ie, glucocorticoids, antimalarials, immunosuppressant agents, 
therapeutic plasma exchange, belimumab, rituximab, abatacept, 
low-dose aspirin and anticoagulants) were summarised in each 
section. In all cases, benefits and harms, certainty of the evidence, 
values and preferences, feasibility, acceptability and equity issues 
were considered to produce a recommendation with special focus 
on ethnic and socioeconomic aspects. Guidelines for Latin American 
patients with lupus have been developed and could be used in 
similar settings.
INTRODuCTION
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex multisys-
temic autoimmune disease resulting, oftentimes, in irreversible 
damage, diminished quality of life and reduced life expec-
tancy.1–3 Genetic and environmental factors play important roles 
in its pathogenesis.4–8 Disease manifestations and severity vary 
according to the patients’ racial/ethnic background and socio-
economic status (SES).1 9 10 Data from Grupo Latino Ameri-
cano de Estudio del Lupus (GLADEL), Lupus in Minorities: 
Nature vs Nurture (LUMINA) and the Lupus Family Registry 
and Repository cohorts have demonstrated that Latin American 
and North American Mestizo patients (mixed Amerindian and 
European ancestry), African descendants and Native Americans 
develop lupus earlier11 12 although diagnostic delays may occur.1 
They also experience more severe disease, have higher disease 
activity levels,1 accrue more organ damage2 and have higher 
mortality rates,1 succumbing mainly to disease activity and/or 
infections.1 3 13–15
Although guidelines for SLE treatment do exist and there is 
scarce evidence to support specific therapies for Latin Amer-
ican patients with lupus,16–21 this regional effort has considered 
the impact of racial/ethnic background1 10 22–28 and SES3 9 on 
lupus outcomes and treatment response.25 26 Other medica-
tion variables such as cost and availability were also taken into 
account since they affect adherence and are relevant in deci-
sion-making.27 28 GLADEL and the Pan-American League of 
Associations of Rheumatology have joined efforts to produce 
these guidelines,29 which are presented by organ systems, 
although manifestations usually occur in more than one. Never-
theless, treatment is usually tailored to the more severe manifes-
tation(s), which usually benefits the less severe.
METHODs
T
wo working teams on logistics and methodological issues 
constituted by experienced Latin American rheumatologists and 
experts in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Devel-
opment and Evaluation (GRADE) guideline system developed a 
framework for these guidelines. Nine organ/system sections were 
prepared with the main findings. Special emphasis was placed on 
reviewing local problems and regional publications.
The GRADE approach was followed in the process (http://
www. 
gradeworkinggroup. 
org) answering the clinical questions 
voted most relevant by the panel. The description of the meth-
odology followed to develop these guidelines has already been 
published.29 All authors listed in this manuscript have partici-
pated in planning, drafting, reviewing, final approval and are 
accountable for all aspects of the manuscript. No ethical approval 
was required by institutions. We present the final recommenda-
tions and their supporting information. Comments from three 
patients with SLE were also considered.
REsuLTs
For each of the subheadings listed below, the panel considered 
interventions based on experience, availability, affordability and 
a stepwise therapeutic approach of the different alternatives. 
Standard of care (SOC) was defined as the use of hydroxychlo-
roquine (HCQ) and, if clinically indicated, low-dose gluco-
corticoids (GC) (prednisone ≤7.5 
mg or equivalent for the 
shortest time).24 Chloroquine remains an alternative for some 
of the Latin American countries where HCQ is not available and 
careful monitoring of eye side effect is recommended. Overar-
ching principles are shown in box 1. Tables summarising the 
evidence that was considered in the process are shown in online

Benefits and harms
Although the panel judged that compared with SOC alone, 
adding MTX, LFN, belimumab or ABT is possibly associated 
with beneficial effects, a significant proportion of patients will 
achieve adequate symptom control with SOC and could be 
spared the adverse effects/excess costs associated to those other 
options.
Recommendation
The panel suggests SOC alone over adding other immunosup-
pressant (IS) in adult patients with SLE with MSK manifestations 
(weak recommendation based on low certainty of the evidence). 
It suggests also adding either MTX, LFN, belimumab or ABT to 
those failing to respond to SOC (weak recommendation based 
on low to moderate certainty of the evidence). Cost and avail-
ability may favour MTX (table 1).
Cutaneous manifestations
a. Which is the best treatment for adult patients with different 
manifestations of cutaneous lupus?
Interventions considered
(1) SOC; (2) SOC plus MTX; (3) SOC plus AZA; (4) SOC plus 
MMF; (5) SOC plus CsA; (6) SOC plus belimumab; (7) SOC 
plus ABT; (8) SOC plus acitretin; (9) SOC plus atacicept; (10) 
SOC plus cyclophosphamide (CYC) (online supplementary 
tables S4.1.1–S4.1.7, S4.2.1–S4.2.5, S4.3.1, S4.4.1, S4.4.2, 
S4.5.1–S4.5.13).
Benefits and harms
The panel judged that a significant proportion of patients will 
achieve adequate symptom control with SOC and could be 
spared the adverse effects/costs of the other therapies.
Recommendation
The panel suggests SOC alone over adding other IS in adult 
patients with SLE with cutaneous manifestations (weak recom-
mendation based on low certainty of the evidence). It also 
suggests adding MTX, AZA, MMF, CsA, CYC or belimumab to 
patients failing to respond to SOC (weak recommendation based 
on low to moderate certainty of the evidence). Cost and avail-
ability may favour MTX and AZA (table 1).
Adult kidney manifestations
a. Which is the best induction treatment for adult patients with 
lupus nephritis?
Interventions considered
(1) GCs; (2) GCs plus high-dose CYC; (3) GCs plus low-dose 
CYC; (4) GCs plus MMF; (5) GCs plus RTX plus MMF; (6) GCs 
plus tacrolimus (TAC); (7) GCs plus AZA (online supplementary 
tables S1.1.1.2, S1.1.1.7, S1.1.1.8, S1.1.1.10, S1.1.2.2, S1.1.2.5, 
S1.1.2.7, S1.1.3.2, S1.1.4.1, S1.2.6).
Benefits and harms
Based on the identified evidence the panel concluded that 
compared with GCs alone, the addition of other IS (CYC, MMF 
or TAC) is associated with significant benefits, higher remission 
rates and lower progression rates to end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD). Head-to-head comparisons between MMF, TAC and 
high-dose CYC showed that MMF and TAC are associated with 
less adverse effects than high-dose CYC. Between low and high-
dose CYC the balance favours the former because of better safety 
profile and comparable efficacy, although this conclusion is 
based on one trial that included predominantly Caucasians. RTX 
did not provide additional benefits when combined with MMF.
Recommendation
The panel recommends SOC (GCs and antimalarials (AM)) in 
addition to an IS (CYC in high or low doses, MMF or TAC) over 
GCs alone, for induction in patients with SLE-related kidney 
disease (strong recommendation based on moderate certainty of 
the evidence). Although more African-American descendants and 
Hispanic patients responded to MMF than CYC (25), limited 
access to MMF and TAC in several Latin American countries, 
due primarily to cost issues, makes CYC the best alternative for 
induction (high or low dose) in these regions (table 2).
 
b. Which is the best maintenance treatment for adult patients 
with lupus nephritis?
Interventions considered
Recommendations are applicable to patients showing partial or 
total remission after induction therapy aiming at sustaining renal 
remission, preventing relapses and achieving the best long-term 
outcome. The following interventions were considered: (1) AZA; 
(2) MMF; (3) CYC; (4) TAC; and (5) CsA (online supplemen-
tary tables S1.1.1.7, S1.1.2.1, S1.1.2.2, S1.2.1, S1.2.3, S1.2.4, 
S1.2.5, S1.2.6, S1.2.7).
Benefits and harms
The panel concluded that long-term IS agents during mainte-
nance therapy prolong stable renal function, reduce proteinuria, 
extend renal survival and minimise the toxicity of GCs. AZA, 
CYC, MMF and CsA seem to be equivalent regarding efficacy 
but MMF and AZA have a better safety profile, particularly 
regarding gonadal toxicity and blood pressure control. We found 
very low certainty of the evidence for TAC as maintenance 
therapy, with studies mostly restricted to Asian populations.

Recommendation
The panel recommends AZA or MMF over CYC for mainte-
nance in patients with SLE-related nephritis (strong recommen-
dation based on low certainty of the evidence, since certainty in 
better efficacy of MMF or AZA over CYC is low but certainty 
of fewer adverse effects is high). Cost and availability issues may 
favour AZA (table 2).
Childhood-onset lupus nephritis
a. Which is the best induction treatment for childhood-onset 
lupus nephritis (cLN)?
Interventions considered
(1) MMF plus GCs; (2) CYC plus GCs; (3) GCs (online supple-
mentary table S9.2.3).
Benefits and harms
The panel concluded that both MMF plus high-dose GCs (pred-
nisone 1–2 
mg/kg/day, maximum 60 
mg/day) and CYC plus high-
dose GCs are associated with significant benefits in comparison 
to GCs alone. No significant differences between these two 
alternatives were noted. The panel pointed that differential 
pharmacokinetic effects of MMF in cLN may exist, which could 
require dosing increase.30 Risk of reduction of ovarian reserve 
and sperm abnormalities should be considered in patients with 
cLN treated with CYC.
Recommendation
The panel suggests high-dose GCs plus MMF or CYC over high-
dose GCs alone in patients with cLN as induction therapy (weak 
recommendation based on low certainty of the evidence). Cost 
and availability may favour CYC despite the risk of gonadal 
toxicity (table 2).
 
b. Which is the best maintenance treatment for cLN?
Interventions considered
(1) SOC plus MMF; (2) SOC plus AZA (online supplementary 
table S9.2.3).
Benefits and harms
The panel concluded that MMF or AZA decreases the occur-
rence of ESRD without significant adverse events, as main-
tenance therapy for cLN. The panel pointed that differential 
pharmacokinetic effects of MMF in cLN may exist, which may 
require dosing increase.30
Recommendation
The panel suggests MMF or AZA over CYC for patients with 
cLN who responded, partially or completely, to induction 
therapy (weak recommendation based on low certainty of the 
evidence). Cost and availability may favour AZA (table 2).
Cardiac manifestations
a. Which is the best treatment for adult patients with lupus-re-
lated acute pericarditis?
Interventions considered
(1) SOC plus colchicine; (2) SOC plus non-steroidal anti-in-
flammatory drugs (NSAID); (3) SOC plus belimumab; (4) 
low to moderate dose of GCs for 4 
weeks and slow tapering 
(online supplementary tables S6.2.1 and S6.3.1).
Benefits and harms
Based on the identified evidence the panel concluded that the 
use of SOC combined with colchicine is associated with signifi-
cant benefits (decrease in pericarditis recurrence rate) compared 
with SOC alone. Belimumab probably made little or no differ-
ence in pericarditis-related symptom improvement.
Recommendation
The panel suggests SOC plus colchicine over SOC plus NSAIDs 
or belimumab for patients with acute SLE-related pericarditis 
(weak recommendation based on low certainty of the evidence) 
(table 3).

nous immunoglobulins (Ig); (3) high-dose GCs plus therapeutic 
plasma exchange (TPE); (4) high-dose GCs plus RTX (online 
supplementary tables S6.1.1 and S6.1.2).
Benefits and harms
In the absence of trustworthy evidence regarding the effects 
of the different interventions in this scenario and considering 
DAH’s high mortality rate, the panel decided that intense and 
early approach is mandatory without prioritising one interven-
tion over another.
Recommendation
The panel recommends that patients with SLE-related DAH be 
treated with intravenous GCs plus CYC and/or intravenous Ig 
and/or TPE and/or RTX over GCs alone (strong recommenda-
tion based on very low certainty of the evidence, since possible 
benefits exist in a life-threatening situation). Cost and avail-
ability may favour GC plus CYC (table 3).
Neuropsychiatric manifestations
a. Which is the best treatment for adult patients with lupus-re-
lated severe, acute neuropsychiatric manifestations?
Interventions considered
(1) High-dose GCs; (2) high-dose GCs plus CYC; and (3) high-
dose GCs plus RTX (online supplementary tables S5.1.1, S5.1.2, 
S5.1.3, S5.1.6, S5.2.1, S5.2.3, S5.3.3, S5.4.1, S5.4.3, S5.5.1, 
S5.5.2, S5.6.1).
Benefits and harms
The panel concluded that both options (GCs plus CYC and GCs 
plus RTX) were associated with large benefits and moderate 
harms in comparison to GCs plus placebo in patients with acute 
neurological manifestations. No studies comparing these two 
options were identified. In terms of SLE and severe neurolog-
ical manifestations, clinical trials with GCs plus CYC focused 
on both general neurologic manifestations, and on seizures, 
psychosis, myelitis, peripheral neuropathy, brain stem disease 
and optic neuritis, specifically. No data were found regarding 
other neuropsychiatric manifestations. The panel significantly 
weighted the fact that the certainty of the evidence was better 
for CYC than RTX and that RTX was only evaluated in refrac-
tory patients.
Recommendation
The panel suggests using GCs plus CYC over GCs alone or GCs 
plus RTX for the treatment of severe neurologic manifesta-
tions in patients with SLE (weak recommendation based on low 
certainty of the evidence). Cost and availability may favour CYC 
(table 4).
Haematological manifestations
a. Which are the best interventions for patients with severe 
acute lupus-related haemolytic anaemia (haemoglobin 
 
≤8 
g/dL)?
Interventions considered
(1) High-dose GCs; (2) GCs plus RTX (online supplementary 
tables S7.1.12 and S7.1.13).
Benefits and harms
The panel concluded that compared with GCs as the first-line 
therapy, the addition of RTX provided moderate beneficial effects 
(reducing the risk of flare) and moderate harms (increasing the 
risk of infections). However, the panel significantly weighted the 
risks associated with RTX as well as availability and cost issues.
Recommendation
The panel suggests using high-dose GCs for patients with severe 
haemolytic anaemia (weak recommendation based on low 
certainty of the evidence).
It also suggests RTX for patients with life-threatening haemo-
lytic anaemia and/or for those in whom high-dose GC treat-
ment fails (weak recommendation based on low certainty of the 
evidence). Cost and availability, however, may prompt the use 
of IS instead of RTX although no data support this assertion 
(table 4).
 
a. Which are the best interventions for patients with se-
vere lupus-related thrombocytopenia (platelet count ≤ 30 
 
x10^9/L)?
Interventions considered
(1) High-dose GCs; (2) high-dose GCs plus RTX; (3) high-dose 
GCs plus intravenous Ig (online supplementary tables S7.1.12, 
S7.1.13, S7.1.15).
Benefits and harms
The panel concluded that compared with GCs as the first-line 
therapy, RTX and intravenous Ig provided moderate beneficial 
effects (increasing the platelet count). The harmful effects were 
judged as moderate for RTX (increase in infections) and small 
for intravenous Ig (infusion reactions).
The panel significantly weighted the risks associated with 
RTX as well as availability and cost issues. In life-threatening 
situations, the panel significantly weighted intravenous Ig’s and 
RTX’s beneficial effect on platelet count.

Recommendation
Recommendations
The panel suggests using high-dose GCs in patients with lupus 
with severe lupus thrombocytopenia (weak recommendation 
based on moderate certainty of the evidence).
It also recommends intravenous Ig with/without GCs or RTX 
plus GCs for patients who are refractory to high-dose GCs, 
those with life-threatening bleeding, those requiring urgent 
surgery and those with infections (strong recommendation based 
on moderate certainty of the evidence). Cost and availability, 
however, may prompt the use of IS instead of RTX although 
there are no data to support this assertion (table 4).
Antiphospholipid syndrome
a. Which is the best treatment for adult patients with SLE with 
antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) and venous thromboem-
bolic disease (VTD)?
Interventions considered
(1) Extended anticoagulation (AC) with vitamin K antagonist 
(compared with not-extended AC); (2) high-intensity AC (inter-
national normalised ratio (INR) 3–4.5) compared with moder-
ate-intensity AC (INR 2–3) (online supplementary tables S10.2.1 
and S10.2.2).
Benefits and harms
The panel judged the effect of extended AC as a large benefit, 
reducing VTD with increase in bleeding risk as a moderate harm. 
For the comparisons of different AC intensities, the panel decided 
to use the evidence from observational studies because it judged 
that it probably better reflects reality given that the randomised 
controlled trials (RCT) are severely flawed (indirectness of inter-
vention as most patients did not reach the INR >3 
goal). They 
judged the reduction in VTD as a large benefit and the bleeding 
increase as a large harm. Hence, the panel considered that the 
balance could favour the intervention only when the risk of VTD 
recurrence is particularly high.
Recommendation
The panel recommends extended AC with vitamin K antagonist 
therapy for patients with APS with VTD (strong recommenda-
tion based on moderate certainty of evidence).
The panel recommends standard (INR 2.0–3.0) over high-in-
tensity (INR 3.0–4.0) AC for patients with APS with VTD (strong 
recommendation based on very low certainty of the evidence, 
since certainty of the effect on VTD recurrence is very low but 
certainty in bleeding risk is high (significant increase in major 
bleeding with INR 3.0–4.0)).
 
b. Which is the best treatment for adult patients with SLE with 
APS and stroke?
Interventions considered
Extended antithrombotic therapy with: (1) vitamin K antago-
nist; (2) low-dose aspirin (LDA: 81–100 mg/day); (3) vitamin K 
antagonist plus LDA; (4) high-intensity AC (INR 3–4.5) (online 
supplementary tables S10.3.1 and S10.3.2).
Benefits and harms
The panel decided to use the body of evidence provided by 
observational studies because it probably better reflects reality 
as the RCTs are severely flawed (indirectness of population 
as most patients were inadequately diagnosed with APS). The 
panel judged the observed reduction in arterial thrombosis with 
high-intensity AC as a large benefit, and the bleeding increase as 
a large harm. Also, it was noted that the observed basal risk (risk 
with LDA) of thromboembolic recurrence in patients with APS 
and arterial events was particularly high, compared with the risk 
of recurrence in patients with VTD.
Recommendation
The panel suggests extended high-intensity (INR 3.0–4.0) over 
standard-intensity AC (INR 2.0–3.0) or LDA alone for patients 
with SLE with APS and stroke (weak recommendation based on 
very low certainty of the evidence).
c. Which is the best treatment for pregnant SLE women with 
antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent pregnancy loss?
Interventions considered
(1) HCQ plus LDA; (2) HCQ plus LDA plus heparin; (3) HCQ 
plus intravenous Ig (online supplementary tables S10.5.1, 
S10.5.2, S10.5.3, S10.5.4, S10.5.5, S10.5.6, S10.5.7, S10.5.8).
Benefits and harms
The panel judged the observed reduction in pregnancy loss with 
the addition of heparin to LDA as a large benefit. This inter-
vention was not associated with significant harms. The addition 
of GCs or intravenous Ig to heparin plus LDA was associated 
with large harms (significant increase in premature delivery) 
without relevant benefits. Regarding heparin administration, 
the panel considered the reduction in pregnancy loss with low 
molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in comparison with unfrac-
tionated heparin (UFH) as a large benefit without significant 
adverse effects. No additional benefits were observed with 
LMWH-enoxaparin 80 
mg compared with 40 
mg.
Recommendation
The panel recommends HCQ plus LMWH plus LDA over HCQ 
plus LDA or adding GCs or intravenous Ig for pregnant patients 
with SLE with antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent preg-
nancy loss (strong recommendation based on moderate certainty 
of the evidence (LMWH plus LDA vs other alternatives) and 
very low certainty of the evidence (GCs and intravenous Ig 
vs other alternatives), since high certainty of harms related to 
GCs (increased premature delivery) and intravenous Ig (costs 
increase, burden related to drug administration) exists).
It also suggests LMWH at a dose of 40 
mg/day over UFH or 
higher doses of LMWH (weak recommendation based on low 
certainty of the evidence) (table 5).
DIsCussION
Treatment of SLE in Latin America remains a challenge despite 
several guidelines published on the management of this 
disease.16–21 The distinct epidemiology, healthcare resources, 
socioeconomic issues and priorities were considered to develop 
these guidelines.
Although these guidelines consider region limitations, the 
inclusion of alternative approaches for tailoring treatment did 
not exclude the task of providing physicians with the state-of-
the-art findings in the field. This was a major advantage of the 
present work since highlighting these advances provides valuable 
basis for future requirement of government authorisation of new 
drugs in these countries.
Of note, problems faced by Latin American countries are 
shared by several developing nations. Therefore, it is expected 
that these guidelines will also be very useful for them. Further-

of migratory movements of people from countries with more 
susceptible SLE groups in terms of frequency and disease severity 
both in terms of race/ethnicity (Mestizos, Asians, Africans) and 
low SES to countries with better life opportunities, we consider 
that these guidelines may be used by physicians anywhere in the 
world, even in developed countries, where such individuals may 
migrate to and seek care for their lupus.
We acknowledge as a limitation that certainty of the evidence 
was not as high as desirable for most recommendations and prob-
ably biased by few randomised clinical trials. Although regional 
information was published on several topics1 4 10 11 23 24 31–49 we 
recognise that these guidelines should be updated as research-
based changes in our understanding of SLE emerge. Regardless, 
the publication of these guidelines must be followed by health 
system engagement and implementation by specialists, major 
steps towards improvement of lupus treatment in Latin America 
and low/middle-income countries.
