 Latanoprostene Bunod 0.024% versus Timolol
Maleate 0.5% in Subjects with Open-Angle
Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension
The APOLLO Study
Robert N. Weinreb, MD,1 Baldo Scassellati Sforzolini, PhD,2 Jason Vittitow, PhD,2 Jeffrey Liebmann, MD3
Purpose:
To compare the diurnal intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effect of latanoprostene bunod (LBN)
ophthalmic solution 0.024% every evening (qPM) with timolol maleate 0.5% twice daily (BID) in subjects with open-
angle glaucoma (OAG) or ocular hypertension (OHT).
Design:
Phase 3, randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-group clinical study.
Participants:
Subjects aged �18 years with a diagnosis of OAG or OHT in 1 or both eyes.
Methods:
Subjects were randomized (2:1) to a 3-month regimen of LBN 0.024% qPM or timolol 0.5% 1 drop
BID. Intraocular pressure was measured at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM of each postrandomization visit (week 2, week 6,
and month 3). Adverse events were recorded throughout the study.
Main Outcome Measures:
The primary efficacy end point was IOP in the study eye measured at each of the
9 assessment time points. Secondary efficacy end points included the proportion of subjects with IOP �18
mmHg consistently at all 9 time points and the proportion of subjects with IOP reduction �25% consistently at all
9 time points.
Results:
Of 420 subjects randomized, 387 completed the study (LBN 0.024%, n ¼ 264; timolol 0.5%, n ¼
123). At all 9 time points, the mean IOP in the study eye was significantly lower in the LBN 0.024% group than in
the timolol 0.5% group (P � 0.002). At all 9 time points, the percentage of subjects with mean IOP �18 mmHg and
the percentage with IOP reduction �25% were significantly higher in the LBN 0.024% group versus the timolol
0.5% group (mean IOP �18 mmHg: 22.9% vs. 11.3%, P ¼ 0.005; IOP reduction �25%: 34.9% vs. 19.5%, P ¼
0.001). Adverse events were similar in both treatment groups.
Conclusions:
In this phase 3 study, LBN 0.024% qPM demonstrated significantly greater IOP lowering than
timolol 0.5% BID throughout the day over 3 months of treatment. Latanoprostene bunod 0.024% was effective
and safe in these adults with OAG or OHT. Ophthalmology 2016;123:965-973 ª 2016 by the American Academy of

Open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is the leading cause of irre-
versible blindness and affects tens of millions of individuals
worldwide.1,2 It is associated with progressive visual field
damage and visual function loss with detrimental effects on
health-related quality of life, even in early stages of the
disease.3 Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is a major risk
factor for primary OAG,4,5 and its reduction has been shown
to delay or reduce the risk of glaucoma development in
ocular
hypertensive
individuals5
and
slow
disease
progression in patients with OAG.6e11 Pharmacologic
lowering of IOP is the first-line intervention in most in-
dividuals with elevated IOP with or without glaucomatous
optic neuropathy (OAG and ocular hypertension [OHT],
respectively), and initial therapy is typically with a topical
prostaglandin analog.12 However, many patients will require
more than 1 therapy to achieve target IOP.12
Latanoprostene bunod (LBN, BOL-303259-X) is a novel
nitric oxide (NO)-donating prostanoid FP receptor agonist
that is rapidly metabolized in the eye into latanoprost acid,
an F2a prostaglandin analog, and butanediol mononitrate.
Nitric oxide is subsequently released from butanediol
mononitrate in conjunction with 1,4 butanediol, an inactive
metabolite.13,14 Latanoprost acid reduces IOP by increasing
aqueous humor outflow primarily through the uveoscleral
pathway (“nonconventional” route) via long-term remodel-
ing of the extracellular matrices in the ciliary body.15e18 In
contrast, NO donors reduce IOP primarily by causing
relaxation of the trabecular meshwork and Schlemm’s canal,
resulting in increased aqueous humor outflow (“conven-
tional drainage” routes).19e27
Latanoprostene bunod demonstrated IOP-lowering ac-
tivity in several preclinical models of OHT, including in
rabbits that are known to be insensitive to latanoprost,
demonstrating the contribution of NO to the IOP-lowering
effect of LBN.13 Further, a well-controlled phase 2 study
in 413 patients with OAG or OHT demonstrated a

 significantly greater reduction in mean diurnal IOP after
28 days of treatment with LBN 0.024% compared with
latanoprost 0.005%.14 The current study was designed
to compare the diurnal IOP-lowering effect of LBN
ophthalmic solution 0.024% every evening (qPM) (hereafter
referred to as “LBN 0.024%”) with timolol maleate
ophthalmic solution 0.5% twice daily (BID) (hereafter
referred to as “timolol 0.5%”) in subjects with OAG
or OHT.
Methods
Study Objectives and Design
The APOLLO study (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01749904)
was a phase 3, randomized, multicenter, double-masked, parallel-
group clinical study. The study was composed of 2 phases: an
active-controlled 3-month efficacy phase followed by an open-
label 9-month safety extension phase. The primary objective of
the efficacy phase was to evaluate the noninferiority of LBN
0.024% qPM compared with timolol 0.5% BID with regard to mean
IOP reduction at each time point throughout the 3 months of
treatment. If LBN 0.024% qPM was determined to be noninferior to
timolol 0.5% BID, the secondary objective was to assess the su-
periority of LBN 0.024% qPM to timolol 0.5% BID. We report
results from the efficacy phase of the study; data from the 9-month
open-label extension phase will be reported separately. Institutional
Review Board/Ethics Committee approval was obtained at each
participating site.
The study was conducted at 45 investigational sites in the
United States and Europe and was performed in accordance with
Good Clinical Practices (as described by the International Con-
ference on Harmonisation), the Code of Federal Regulations, the
ethical principles in the Declaration of Helsinki, Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act regulations, and other appli-
cable local regulations. All subjects provided written informed
consent before the performance of any study procedures.
Subjects
The study enrolled men and women aged �18 years with a diag-
nosis of OAG (including pigmentary or pseudoexfoliative OAG) or
OHT in 1 or both eyes. Intraocular pressure was assessed once at
screening and at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM at baseline to establish
eligibility and baseline values. Eligible subjects had an IOP �26
mmHg at a minimum of 1 time point, �24 mmHg at a minimum of
1 time point, and �22 mmHg at 1 time point in the same eye, and
IOP �36 mmHg at all 3 measurement time points in both eyes at
baseline, which occurred after a washout period in those subjects
receiving topical hypotensive treatment at the time of enrollment.
In addition, subjects were required to have a best-corrected visual
acuity (BCVA) of þ0.7 logarithm of the minimum angle of reso-
lution (logMAR) units (Snellen equivalent of w20/100) or better in
either eye.
Subjects were excluded if they had participated in any clinical
trial within 30 days before screening for subjects requiring a
washout period or 30 days before baseline (day 0) for subjects not
requiring a washout period. Additional exclusion criteria included a
known hypersensitivity or contraindications to latanoprost, NO-
donating medications, timolol maleate, other b-adrenergic recep-
tor antagonists, or any ingredients in study drugs; central corneal
thickness >600 mm in either eye; any condition that prevented
reliable applanation tonometry (e.g., significant corneal surface
abnormalities) in either eye; and advanced glaucoma (cup-to-disk
ratio >0.8 or split fixation) or other significant ophthalmic disease.
Subjects requiring treatment with ocular or systemic corticoste-
roids, or who had an anticipated need to initiate or modify medi-
cation that was known to affect IOP (e.g., b-adrenergic antagonists,
a-adrenergic agonists, calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-
converting
enzyme
inhibitors,
and
angiotensin
II
receptor
blockers) during the efficacy phase also were excluded from study
participation.
Study Treatments and Assessments
Baseline data, including demographics, relevant medical and
ocular history, and concomitant medications, were recorded at the
screening visit. Eligible subjects receiving topical ocular hypo-
tensive treatment at screening were required to discontinue treat-
ment and undergo a washout period before the baseline visit (day
0), varying in duration depending on the IOP-lowering medication
used (a minimum of 5 days for miotics and oral/topical carbonic
anhydrase inhibitors, 14 days for a and a/b agonists, and 28 days
for prostaglandin analogs, b-blockers, and combination drugs
including b-blockers). Subjects taking topical b-blockers or pros-
taglandin analogs at screening were required to participate in a
midwashout safety evaluation visit (day �14). Subjects were
withdrawn from the study if their IOP was >36 mmHg in either
eye at any point during the washout period.
After baseline IOP measurements, eligible subjects were ran-
domized 2:1 to receive LBN 0.024% qPM and vehicle every morning
or timolol 0.5% BID for 3 months. For masking purposes, each
treatment was labeled with identical investigational labels and
packaged in identical kit boxes. Study drug was dispensed via an
Interactive Response Technology system. Randomization schedules
were created by a designated unmasked statistician using SAS
Version 9.2 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC). Each subject received
study kits containing 4 eye drop bottles and was instructed to instill
1 drop of the study drug from the “night” dosing bottle in the affected
eye(s) at approximately 8 PM each day and 1 drop of the study drug
from the “day” dosing bottle at approximately 8 AM each day (with
the exception of the morning of scheduled clinic visits, when the
subject instilled the study drug after 8 AM in-clinic assessments).
The study eye was the eye that qualified per inclusion criteria
on day 0; if both eyes qualified, then the study eye was the eye with
the higher mean diurnal IOP value at day 0 or the right eye if both
eyes had the same mean diurnal IOP value. If both eyes of a subject
had a diagnosis of OAG or OHT, then both eyes were treated for
the duration of the study, even if only 1 eye qualified at day 0.
After randomization, subjects completed 3 study visits: week 2
(�2 days), week 6 (�3 days), and month 3 (�10 days). At each
visit, IOP was measured in both eyes at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM using
a Goldmann applanation tonometer. Whenever possible, the same
operator measured IOP, and the same tonometer was used at each
visit for a given subject.
Safety assessments included adverse events, vital signs, BCVA
(measured using the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
standard protocol), conjunctival hyperemia assessment, slit-lamp
examination findings, ophthalmoscopy findings, and specular mi-
croscopy. The investigator graded conjunctival hyperemia on a
scale of 1 to 4 using photographic standards (1 ¼ none, 4 ¼ severe).
Slit-lamp findings, ophthalmoscopy findings, and specular micro-
scopy results will be reported separately along with data from the
9-month open-label extension phase.
End Points
The primary efficacy end point was the IOP in the subject’s study
eye measured at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM at each postbaseline visit
(week 2, week 6, and month 3). The key secondary efficacy end
points were the proportion of subjects with IOP �18 mmHg

 consistently at all 9 time points in the first 3 months and the pro-
portion of subjects with IOP reduction �25% consistently at all 9
time points in the first 3 months. Additional secondary end points
included the change from baseline (CFB) in IOP measured at 8 AM,
12 PM, and 4 PM at each postbaseline visit and the CFB in diurnal
IOP (defined as the mean of IOP at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM) at each
postrandomization visit. Safety end points during the efficacy
phase included BCVA, conjunctival hyperemia assessment, and
incidence of ocular and systemic adverse events.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size estimate was based on a noninferiority test of the
difference between LBN 0.024% versus timolol 0.5% with respect
to IOP in the per-protocol (PP) population, assuming a standard
deviation (SD) of 3.75 mmHg, a power of 90%, a 2-sided a ¼
0.05, and a noninferiority margin of 1.5 mmHg. The SD was based
on data from a phase 2b study of LBN 0.024% and the timolol arm
of a phase 3 study.28 To account for potential dropouts and
protocol violations, 393 subjects were to be randomized to the
LBN 0.024% and timolol 0.5% treatment groups in a 2:1 ratio.
The primary efficacy analysis was performed using analysis of
covariance (ANCOVA) in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population,
which comprised all randomized subjects who instilled at least 1
dose of study drug and had at least 1 postbaseline IOP assessment.
In the ANCOVA model, treatment was a variable and time-
matched baseline mean IOP was a covariate. Missing data were
inputted using the last observation carried forward (LOCF)
method. The 2 treatment groups were compared for each time point
by visit, and the least squares mean of each treatment group, the
difference in the least squares mean (LBN 0.024%�timolol 0.5%),
and the 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the difference
were obtained. Noninferiority was determined if the upper limit of
the CIs for the difference did not exceed 1.5 mmHg at all 9 time
points and did not exceed 1.00 mmHg for �5 of the 9 time points.
If noninferiority was determined, superiority at each time point was
demonstrated if the upper limit of the 95% CI did not exceed
0 mmHg at all 9 time points. To supplement the primary analyses,
the ANCOVA was repeated for the PP population (i.e., all subjects
in the ITT population who remained in the study through month 3
with no missing postbaseline IOP assessments and no major pro-
tocol violations). In addition, the primary analysis was repeated on
the ITT population using the worst observation carried forward
(WOCF) method.
If noninferiority of LBN 0.024% to timolol 0.5% was shown,
secondary end points analyzed were based on the ITT population
with LOCF, with supportive analyses performed using the PP
population. The proportion of subjects with IOP �18 mmHg at all
time points in the first 3 months and the proportion with IOP
reduction �25% at all time points in the first 3 months were
summarized categorically. Percent reduction from baseline was
calculated as 100*(baseline mean IOP � postbaseline mean IOP)/
baseline mean IOP. For each key secondary end point, the 2-sided
95% CI around the difference in proportions (LBN 0.024%�
timolol 0.5%) was calculated, and the P value was determined
using Pearson’s chi-square test. An ANCOVA of CFB in IOP was
performed with fixed-effect terms for treatment and baseline for the
specified postbaseline time points at week 2, week 6, and month 3.
In addition, an ANCOVA of CFB in mean diurnal IOP was per-
formed with fixed-effect terms for treatment and diurnal baseline
IOP at each postbaseline visit. The CFB in IOP was summarized
using descriptive statistics, and within-treatment group paired t
tests were performed for the CFB mean IOP at each time point of
each visit.
Safety analyses were based on the safety population, which
included all randomized subjects who instilled at least 1 dose of the
study drug. Ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
were summarized for study eyes, treated fellow eyes, and non-
treated fellow eyes separately by treatment group. Nonocular
(systemic) TEAEs were summarized using discrete summaries at
the subject and event level, respectively, using the Medical Dic-
tionary for Regulatory Activities coding of the system organ class
and preferred term for each treatment group. Treatment-emergent
adverse events were summarized by relationship to study drug
and severity. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and heart rate
were summarized by visit using descriptive statistics. Other safety
data presented in this article, including BCVA and conjunctival
hyperemia, were described separately for study eyes, treated fellow
eyes, and nontreated fellow eyes and summarized using descriptive
statistics (BCVA) or categorically (conjunctival hyperemia).
All CIs, statistical tests, and P values were reported as 2-sided
and assessed at the 5% significance level. Continuous data were
summarized using descriptive statistics (number, mean, SD, me-
dian, minimum, and maximum). All statistical analyses were per-
formed using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc.) version 9.2 or
higher.
Results
Subjects
Subjects were enrolled from January 31, 2013, to April 30, 2014.
Of 679 subjects screened, 420 were randomized to treatment with
LBN 0.024% (n ¼ 286) or timolol 0.5% (n ¼ 134). A total of 418
randomized subjects instilled at least 1 dose of study drug and
comprised the safety population (n ¼ 283 LBN 0.024%, n ¼ 135
timolol 0.5%); 1 subject did not have any recorded postbaseline
IOP readings; thus, 417 subjects were included in the ITT popu-
lation (n ¼ 284 LBN 0.024%, n ¼ 133 timolol 0.5%). One subject
randomized to LBN received timolol and therefore was included in
the timolol 0.5% safety population and the LBN 0.024% ITT
population. The PP population included 272 subjects (n ¼ 192
LBN 0.024%, n ¼ 80 timolol 0.5%). Overall, 387 subjects (92.6%)
in the safety population (92.9% [263/283] of the LBN 0.024%
group, 91.9% [124/135] of the timolol 0.5% group) and 387 sub-
jects (92.8%) in the ITT population (93.0% [264/284] of the LBN
0.024% group, 92.5% [123/133] of the timolol 0.5% group)
completed the 3-month treatment. For the 30 subjects in the ITT
population who discontinued the study (n ¼ 20 LBN 0.024%, n ¼
10 timolol 0.5%), reasons for discontinuation included adverse
events (n ¼ 4 in each group), withdrawal of consent (n ¼ 6 LBN
0.024%, n ¼ 1 timolol 0.05%), failure to follow required study
procedures (n ¼ 2 in each group), investigator decision (n ¼ 1
LBN 0.024%, n ¼ 2 timolol 0.5%), lost to follow-up (n ¼ 1 LBN
0.024%), and other reasons (n ¼ 6 LBN 0.024%, n ¼ 1 timolol
0.5%).
Subjects in the ITT population had a mean age of 64.2 years,
were of predominantly European or African ancestry, and were of
non-Hispanic/non-Latino ethnicity. Treatment groups were com-
parable with regard to demographics (Table 1) and baseline eye
characteristics (Table 2). More than two thirds of subjects
(71.9%)
were
taking
topical
IOP-lowering
medication
at
screening or had used IOP-lowering medication 30 days before
screening and participated in a medication washout.
Efficacy
Primary Efficacy Outcomes. Mean IOP in the study eye was
significantly lower in the LBN 0.024% group (range, 17.8e18.7
mmHg) than in the timolol 0.5% group (range, 19.1e19.8 mmHg)
at all 9 efficacy time points assessed (8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM at

 week 2, week 6, and month 3) (Fig 1). Noninferiority of LBN
0.024% to timolol 0.5% in the ITT population was demonstrated
on the basis of ANCOVA for the comparison of mean IOP
between treatment groups: The upper limit of the 95% CIs for
the difference between treatments was �1.0 mmHg for all of the
9 efficacy time points (Table 3). Likewise, ANCOVA results
demonstrated the superiority of LBN 0.024% to timolol 0.5% in
the ITT population because the upper limit of the 95% CIs for
the difference between treatments was �0 mmHg at all 9 time
points (Table 3). The primary end point findings were supported
by results of an ANCOVA analysis in the PP population and
with
WOCF
in
the
ITT
population
(data
not
shown).
Furthermore, primary end point findings were not affected by
prior treatment status (subjects on treatment at enrollment vs.
subjects not on treatment at enrollment), subject age (<65 vs.
�65 years), or concurrent use of systemic b-blockers (data not
shown).
Secondary Efficacy Outcomes. A higher percentage of subjects
in the LBN 0.024% group (22.9%) compared with the timolol 0.5%
group (11.3%) had an IOP �18 mmHg consistently at all 9 efficacy
time points measured (Fig 2) (difference, 11.6%; 95% CI, 4.3e18.9;
P ¼ 0.005). Likewise, a higher percentage of subjects in the LBN
0.024% group (34.9%) compared with the timolol 0.5% group
(19.5%) had an IOP reduction �25% consistently at all 9 time
points measured (Fig 2) (difference, 15.3%; 95% CI, 6.6e24.0;
P ¼ 0.001). Similar results were observed in the PP population.
Further ANCOVA analysis showed that the mean CFB in mean
IOP was greater in the LBN 0.024% group (range, �7.7 to �9.1
mmHg) than in the timolol 0.5% group (range, �6.6 to �8.0
mmHg) at all 9 efficacy time points (Fig 3). The difference in the
CFB in mean IOP between treatment groups was statistically
significant at all 9 efficacy time points (P � 0.002). As was the
case for the individual time points, mean diurnal IOP (average of
IOP at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM) was significantly lower in the
LBN 0.024% group compared with the timolol 0.5% group at
each visit (18.2 vs. 19.5 mmHg at week 2, 18.1 vs. 19.3 mmHg
at week 6, and 18.2 vs. 19.4 mmHg at month 3; P < 0.001 for
all). Similar to the CFB at individual time points, at each study
visit, there was a statistically significantly (P < 0.001) greater
CFB
in
mean
diurnal
IOP
in
the
LBN
0.024%
group
(range, �8.4 to �8.6 mmHg) than in the timolol 0.5% group
(range, �7.1 to �7.3 mmHg).
Safety
Exposure. Mean � SD days of exposure to study drug in the safety
population was similar in the LBN 0.024% group (89.7�14.4
days) and the timolol 0.5% group (89.4�18.4 days) during the 3-
month efficacy phase.
Ocular Adverse Events. The percentage of study or fellow
treated eyes experiencing at least 1 ocular TEAE was comparable
in the LBN 0.024% and timolol 0.5% groups (Table 4). Ocular
TEAEs reported in �1% of eyes in both treatment groups
included eye irritation, conjunctival hyperemia, eye pain, dry
eye,
and
instillation
site
pain.
Most
ocular
TEAEs
were
considered related to the study drug and mild or moderate in
severity with a few exceptions. In the LBN 0.024% group, 2
subjects experienced a severe TEAE in treated fellow eyes,
scleritis and foreign body requiring surgery, both considered
unrelated to treatment. One subject in the timolol 0.5% group
had
severe
eye
pain
(study
and
fellow
treated
eye)
and
instillation site pain (study eye) considered possibly related to
treatment, and 1 subject experienced a severe IOP increase
considered unrelated study treatment.
Two subjects in the LBN treatment group discontinued because
of ocular adverse events; 1 subject had mild conjunctival edema
and mild conjunctival irritation, considered probably treatment
related, in both eyes, and the other had severe scleritis in the treated
fellow eye considered unrelated to study treatment. In the timolol
group, 5 subjects discontinued because of an ocular adverse event.
These included eyelid edema (mild, probably related), eye irritation
(moderate, definitely related), eye allergy (moderate, unlikely
related), and allergic conjunctivitis (moderate, unrelated) in both
eyes of 4 subjects; and elevated IOP (severe, unrelated) in the
treated fellow eye of 1 subject.
Nonocular Adverse Events. The proportion of subjects expe-
riencing �1 nonocular TEAE was comparable in the LBN 0.024%
and timolol 0.5% groups (12.7% and 14.1%, respectively).
Treatment-related nonocular TEAEs were reported by 5 subjects
(1.8%) in the LBN 0.024% group (headache in 2 subjects; fatigue

0.5% group (bradycardia, procedural headache, and rhinorrhea,
each in 1 subject). Severe/serious nonocular TEAEs were experi-
enced by 5 subjects in the LBN 0.024% group (femoral neck
fracture, surgery for osteoarthritis, dizziness, chest pain, each in 1
subject; peripheral edema and pain in extremity in 1 subject) and
by 2 subjects in the timolol 0.5% group (torn rotator cuff,
arthropod bite). All severe/serious TEAEs were considered to be
unrelated or unlikely related to the study drug; all other TEAEs
were mild or moderate in severity. No deaths occurred during the
3-month treatment period.
Two subjects in the LBN treatment group discontinued because
of a nonocular adverse event: severe dizziness considered unlikely
to be related to treatment in 1 subject and moderate fatigue
considered possibly related to treatment in the other.

 vary notably during the study. Mean (SD) logMAR BCVA in the
study eye in the LBN and timolol treatment groups was 0.09
(0.137) and 0.07 (0.124) at baseline and 0.08 (0.134) and 0.07
(0.139) at 3 months, respectively.
Approximately 40% of subjects were observed by the investi-
gator to have conjunctival hyperemia, mostly mild, at baseline
before treatment, in their prospective evaluation of hyperemia us-
ing photographic standards. The percentage of subjects with
conjunctival hyperemia was similar between posttreatment study
visits and between the 2 treatment groups for both the study eyes
and the treated fellow eyes with small variations from baseline in
the overall incidence of conjunctival hyperemia through 3 months.
However, the percentage of subjects with moderate or severe hy-
peremia was numerically higher in the LBN 0.024% group
compared with the timolol 0.5% group in both study eyes and
treated fellow eyes at week 2 (study eye: 9.6% and 0.7%,
respectively; treated fellow eye: 10.2% and 1.5%, respectively),
week 6 (study eye: 11.8% and 3.8%, respectively; treated fellow
eye: 10.7% and 5.4%, respectively), and month 3 (study eye: 8.5%
and 2.4%, respectively; treated fellow eye: 9.8% and 1.6%,
respectively).
Discussion
This
randomized,
multicenter,
double-masked parallel-
group study demonstrated that LBN 0.024% instilled qPM
resulted in significantly greater IOP lowering compared with
timolol 0.5% instilled BID throughout the day over 3
months of treatment. The mean IOP in the study eye was
statistically significantly lower in the LBN group than in the
timolol group consistently at all 9 measured time points,
whether analyzed for the ITT population using the LOCF or
WOCF, supporting the robustness of the findings. Of note,
the difference between the LBN and timolol groups in mean
IOP exceeded 1 mmHg at all time points. The clinical sig-
nificance of this difference is underscored by results of the
Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial, which found that in patients
with OAG, each millimeter of mercury of IOP reduction
from baseline at the first follow-up visit (3 months) was
associated with an approximately 10% reduction in pro-
gression of visual field loss.9 More recently, Heijl29
suggested a 19% reduction in the risk of visual field
progression for every 1 mmHg IOP reduction on the basis

 of a review of data from the UK Glaucoma Treatment Study
evaluating the effect of latanoprost 0.005% compared with
vehicle in patients with OAG.11,29
Results of secondary efficacy end points were consistent
with the primary outcome measures. Significantly more
subjects treated with LBN 0.024% than timolol 0.5% ach-
ieved predetermined criterions of an absolute IOP �18
mmHg or IOP reduction �25% at each of the 9 measured
time points, and the CFB in mean IOP and mean diurnal
IOP were consistently significantly greater in the LBN
group throughout the study. Several landmark trials support
the clinical practice of setting a target diurnal IOP in the
treatment of patients with OAG or OHT and have demon-
strated that IOP reduction to such targets slows the rate of
development or progression of visual loss and structural
damage caused by glaucoma.5e7,9 The Advanced Glaucoma
Intervention Study demonstrated that patients with glau-
coma reaching and maintaining a target IOP of �18 mmHg
through surgical intervention supplemented with medical
treatment had a significantly reduced progression of visual
field loss compared with eyes that failed to meet this target.7
Likewise, in the Ocular Hypertension Treatment Study, in
which treatment with IOP-lowering medication resulted in
a 23% reduction in IOP, only 36 of 817 patients developed
glaucoma by 60 months versus 89 of 819 patients in the
observation group.5 The Early Manifest Glaucoma Trial, in
which treated patients had an average IOP lowering of 25%,
demonstrated that IOP-lowering treatment halved the risk of
disease progression in patients with OAG (hazard ratio,
0.50; 95% CI, 0.35e0.71).6,9
Intraocular pressure is the only modifiable risk factor in
patients with OAG, with numerous studies demonstrating a
relationship between IOP lowering and slowed progression
or prevention of OAG, regardless of the interventional
method.5e11,30e34 Treatment options include pharmaco-
therapy, laser therapy, and surgery, and the choice of ther-
apy should be individualized in consideration of patient
factors and preferences. Pharmacologic treatment with
prostaglandin analogs or b-blockers commonly is used as
initial intervention for IOP lowering in patients with OAG.35
Features such as IOP-lowering potential, safety, and dosing
convenience are important considerations.
Latanoprostene bunod is a novel monotherapy with the
pharmacologic activity of both a prostaglandin F2a analog
(latanoprost acid) and, via the NO donating moiety, the
physiologic signaling mediator NO. Both active moieties of
LBN independently have been shown to lower IOP via 2
distinct mechanisms: latanoprost acid via the uveosceleral
(nonconventional) aqueous outflow pathway and NO via the
trabecular
meshwork/Schlemm’s
canal
(conventional)
outflow pathway.15e27 The intent in the development of this
new monotherapy was to provide enhanced IOP-lowering
potential
over
currently
available
glaucoma
therapies
without an increased risk of adverse events.
The additional IOP lowering by LBN over latanoprost
0.005% (Xalatan,
Pfizer, New
York, NY) has
been
demonstrated in both nonclinical animal models of OHT
and a phase 2 clinical study.13,14 The phase 2 study
compared LBN with latanoprost in 396 patients with OAG
and OHT (the VOYAGER study).14 After 28 days of once-
daily treatment in the evening, the reduction in mean diurnal
IOP from baseline was significantly greater with LBN
0.024% than with latanoprost 0.005% (�9.0 vs. �7.8
mmHg, P ¼ 0.005). These findings are suggestive of an
additive benefit of the NO-donating component of LBN.
Although the current study did not include a latanoprost
comparator arm, an additional IOP lowering of >1 mmHg
over timolol was apparent at all evaluation time points over
3 months.
In addition to IOP-lowering effectiveness, it is important
that LBN not be associated with clinically limiting safety or
tolerability issues. In the current study, the adverse event
profiles of LBN and timolol were similar over the 3 months
of treatment. In fact, TEAEs were fairly uncommon in both
groups, and reports of eye pain and irritation were low.
Visual acuity findings and vital signs measurements were
unremarkable. Although the overall proportions of subjects
with ocular hyperemia as assessed by investigators were
similar between treatment groups both before and after
treatment at each visit, a greater proportion of subjects in the
LBN group were rated as having moderate to severe hy-
peremia compared with subjects in the timolol group. These
findings are consistent with reported rates of hyperemia in
patients treated with latanoprost.36

 In conclusion, LBN 0.024%, a once-daily NO-donating
prostaglandin monotherapy with a dual mechanism of ac-
tion, was safe and significantly more effective than timolol
0.5% BID in reducing mean IOP in patients with OAG and
OHT. The ability to more consistently lower IOP to �18
mmHg may provide a significant advantage over topical b-
blockers.
