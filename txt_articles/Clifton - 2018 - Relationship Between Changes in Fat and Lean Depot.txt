 Relationship Between Changes in Fat and Lean Depots Following
Weight Loss and Changes in Cardiovascular Disease Risk Markers
Peter M. Clifton, MD, PhD
Background-—Gluteofemoral fat mass has been associated with improved cardiovascular disease risk factors. It is not clear if loss
of this protective fat during weight loss partially negates the effect of loss of visceral fat. The aim of this study was to examine
regional fat loss in a large weight-loss cohort from one center and to determine if fat loss in the leg and total lean tissue loss is
harmful.
Methods and Results-—We combined the data from 7 of our previously published 3-month weight-loss studies and examined the
relationship between regional fat and lean tissue loss and changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors in 399 participants. At
baseline, leg fat was positively associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in women and inversely with fasting triglyceride
level in both sexes. Abdominal lean tissue was also related to systolic blood pressure in men. Changes in regional fat and lean
tissue were positively associated with changes in glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (r=0.11–0.22, P<0.05) with leg fat and arm lean tissue dominating in
multivariate regression. After adjustment for total weight or total fat change, these relationships disappeared except for a positive
relationship between arm and lean leg mass loss and changes in triglycerides and systolic blood pressure.
Conclusions-—Loss of leg fat and leg lean tissue was directly associated with beneficial changes in cardiovascular disease risk
markers. Loss of lean tissue may not have an adverse effect on cardiovascular disease risk, and measures to retain lean tissue
during weight loss may not be necessary. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008675. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.118.008675.)

T
here is a clear positive cross-sectional relationship
between visceral adipose tissue and cardiovascular
disease (CVD) risk factors and insulin resistance, while large
subcutaneous lower body adipose tissue depots have been
associated with protective effects in many studies on insulin,
glucose, and lipids and arterial disease.1–11
Gluteofemoral fat, as measured by thigh circumference, hip
circumference, or leg adipose tissue mass, is independently
associated with lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels, and increased high-
density
lipoprotein
(HDL)
cholesterol
levels.1–4,9–11
Gluteofemoral fat mass is associated with lower aortic
calcification and arterial stiffness4,7,8 and decreased progres-
sion of aortic calcification.12 Lower-body fat is inversely
associated with fasting insulin levels and insulin levels after
an oral glucose load, and positively associated with insulin
sensitivity.3,6,9–11 In healthy overweight and obese women,
hip circumference and thigh adipose tissue mass are asso-
ciated with a lower HbA1c.13 In the AusDiab study, a larger hip
circumference was associated with a lower prevalence of
undiagnosed
diabetes
mellitus
and
dyslipidemia.14
The
INTERHEART study established an independent association
between larger hip circumference and lower risk for myocar-
dial infarction.15 In the European Prospective Investigation
into Cancer and Nutrition–Norfolk study, larger hip circum-
ference was associated with a lower hazard ratio for coronary
heart disease.16
During weight loss, it is not clear if loss of these apparently
protective depots weakens the beneficial effects of visceral
fat loss. In the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes)
study,17 in 92 volunteers with type 2 diabetes mellitus, all
metabolic variables except LDL cholesterol were positively
associated with changes in all adipose tissue depots; that is,
leg fat loss was not apparently harmful. After adjusting for
total weight loss, arm fat loss was still positively associated

 with changes in TG and systolic blood pressure (SBP) and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP), while leg fat was positively
associated with changes in DBP. No negative effect of fat loss
in these regions was seen.
Opposite findings occurred in a short-term study by Okura
et al,18 who found leg adipose tissue mass change after a 14-
week intervention study with diet and exercise in 128 healthy
obese women was inversely associated with DBP, LDL
cholesterol levels, and the number of coronary heart disease
risk factors even after adjustment for total fat and lean tissue
loss.
Thus, there is no agreement in whether regional fat
changes with weight loss are positively or negatively related
to changes in CVD risk markers, and there has been no
comprehensive review of this area. The aim of this study is to
assess whether loss of peripheral fat or peripheral lean tissue,
particularly in the leg, has adverse effects after diet-induced
weight loss. We hypothesize that loss of leg fat and lean tissue
will reduce the improvement in CVD risk factors seen with
visceral fat loss and that sex may influence the outcome seen.
Methods
Seven published weight-loss studies from our research
group,19–25 which had a total body dual-energy x-ray absorp-
tiometry scan at baseline and 12 weeks and had a minimum
of measures of glucose and lipids at each time point, were
combined electronically for analysis. All studies followed a
similar protocol, with variations in the amount of protein,
carbohydrate, and fat, and had similar amounts of weight loss.
All studies were approved by the Commonwealth Scientific
and Industrial Research Organization Human Ethics Commit-
tee, and all subjects gave written, informed consent. All
interventions were tightly energy controlled, with a reduction
in energy intake of about 30% with dietitian visits every 2
weeks and a target weight loss of 0.5 to 1 kg/week. Protein
intake varied from 15% to 30% of energy with matching
differences in either carbohydrate or fat but not both. Women
predominated in the data set, which was composed entirely of
Anglo-Saxon individuals. One study in people with type 2
diabetes mellitus in which 25 managed their diabetes mellitus
by diet alone, 26 required oral hypoglycemic medications (19
on metformin, 15 on sulfonylureas alone or combination), and
4 required insulin. Four subjects with fasting plasma glucose
of 4–6 mmol/L were asked to cease medications before
commencement of the diet to allay possible hypoglycemic
episodes with weight loss. Volunteers were requested not to
change their medication for lipids and blood pressure, but the
exact number on these medications was not recorded in the
papers. Many volunteers (157) had impaired fasting glucose
(5.6–7.0 mmol/L). The data, analytic methods, and study
materials will not be made available to other researchers for
purposes of reproducing the results or replicating the
procedure.
Statistical Analysis
Unpaired t test, one-way ANOVA, Pearson correlation coeffi-
cients, and backward linear regression were performed using
SPSS 22 (IBM). Data shown are mean and standard deviation,
and P<0.05 is accepted as being statistically significant. CVD
risk factors were correlated with absolute total and regional
fat and lean masses separately in men and women at
baseline. Changes in total and regional fat and lean tissues
were computed separately in men and women and assessed
using paired t tests within each sex and one-way ANOVA
between sexes with adjustment for diabetes mellitus. Overall
absolute regional fat changes were correlated with absolute
changes in CVD risk factors after adjustment for sex by partial
Pearson correlations (SPPS 22). No adjustment was made for
multiple comparisons.
Multiple linear regression with backward selection was
conducted examining 3 predictor areas—abdomen, arms and
legs, both fat and lean—and relating them to changes in CVD
risk markers before and after adjustment for changes in all
regions together and total weight and total fat change.
Diabetes mellitus, sex, and study were included as predictors
but were not forced into the equations if they were not
significant. Collinearity was assessed by the variance inflation
factor. Changes in fat and lean regions were also assessed
using Z scores and percentage change in each region.
Results
Baseline Characteristics
In this study population (Table 1), there were 88 men and 311
women with an average age of 53 and 49 years (P=0.009) and
a body mass index of 33.7, with 18 men and 35 women with
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• Loss of fat and lean tissue in any region is associated with a
reduction in cardiovascular risk factors.
• Even after adjustment for total fat or total weight loss,
reduction in leg and arm lean tissue was associated with
reductions in triglycerides and systolic blood pressure.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• It appears that worrying about the inevitable loss of lean
tissue with weight loss is misplaced and special efforts to
minimize lean tissue loss are not required.

 type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 53 people with diabetes mellitus
were older than the people without diabetes mellitus (61
years versus 48 years, P<0.01) while BMI was the same.
Fasting insulin and glucose were higher in the diabetes
mellitus group (P<0.01). Baseline dual-energy x-ray absorp-
tiometry and after 12 weeks’ weight loss and corresponding
CVD risk markers are shown in Table 2. Men had greater
abdominal fat but lower total, arm, and leg fat than women (all
P<0.001). Men had greater lean tissue in all regions (all
P<0.001). There was limited and weak evidence of protection
from elevated CVD risk factors from specific fat and lean
regions, with leg fat associated with a greater HDL cholesterol
in women and lower TG in both sexes, before and after
adjustment for diabetes mellitus status (Table 3). Thus, from
these baseline data one could hypothesis that a greater loss
of leg fat relative to other regions might adversely influence
HDL cholesterol and TG after weight loss.
Changes in Fat and Lean Tissue With Weight Loss
Over 12 weeks men lost 9.5 kg (9.1%) and women 7.2 kg
(8.1%; P<0.001 for difference between sexes). Men lost more
total, abdominal, and leg fat as a percentage of fat in that
region than did women (24% versus 15% [P<0.001], 22%

respectively), while arm fat (16% versus 14%) and lean tissue
losses were not different, with the latter varying from 2% to
5% of initial mass. In absolute terms, women lost more arm fat
and men more total and abdominal fat and total, leg, arm, and
abdominal lean tissue. In men, when expressed as a
percentage of baseline fat, total and abdominal fat changes
were greater than leg and arm fat changes. In women, leg fat
loss was lower than in the other depots and arm fat loss was
only a little less than total and abdominal fat loss. As a
percentage of total fat loss, abdominal fat loss in men was
more than twice as great as arm fat loss (30% versus 11%;
P<0.001), whereas in women these regions were the same
(17% versus 22%), with leg fat loss exceeding arm loss (29%
versus 22%; P=0.006). Men had a greater percentage of total
fat lost as abdominal fat compared with women (30% versus
22%; P=0.034), but the other regions were the same.

 protein (CRP). Changes in TG were positively related to
changes in glucose, insulin, alanine aminotransferase and
inversely with changes in HDL (Table 4). Changes in insulin
were positively related to changes in glucose and inversely
with changes in HDL, while changes in glucose were
positively related to changes in DBP and gamma-glutamyl
transferase.
Correlation Between Fat and Lean Tissue
Changes and Changes in CVD Risk Markers
All variables except HDL cholesterol and CRP were positively
related to changes in weight and fat, with most being
positively related to abdominal fat and arm fat changes
(glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, LDL, TG, SBP, and DBP)
and about one half being positively related to leg fat changes
(TC, TG and LDL; Table 5). Lean tissue changes were similar
but not as common. No negative relations were observed.
Multiple Regression
Collinearity of predictors
Total fat loss was strongly related to change in arm fat
(r=0.53), change in leg fat (r=0.73), and weakly to abdominal
fat loss (r=0.21). Leg fat and arm fat changes were weakly
correlated (r=0.29), whereas abdominal fat loss was more
strongly correlated with leg fat loss (r=0.42) and very weakly
with arm fat loss (r=0.11, P=0.007).
Total lean tissue loss was strongly related to change in arm
lean tissue loss (r=0.41), leg lean tissue loss (r=0.78), and

 abdominal lean tissue loss (r=0.43). Leg lean and arm lean
tissue losses were strongly correlated (r=0.41), whereas
abdominal lean tissue loss was weakly related to arm lean
tissue loss (r=0.19) and more strongly to leg lean tissue loss
(r=0.36).
Regional fat and lean tissue losses were strongly related in
the arm and abdomen (r=0.39–0.43) but weakly related in the
leg (r=0.2). Total fat and total lean tissue losses were not
correlated.
In the final regression models, the collinearity diagnostics
were low, with a variance inflation factor of 1 to 1.2.
Insulin and glucose. Change in insulin over 12 weeks of
weight loss was positively related to loss of leg fat (P=0.002)
after adjustment for baseline insulin (P<0.001) and diabetes
mellitus (P<0.001). Total variance accounted for was 45%,
most of which was attributable to the relationship with
baseline insulin. Adjustment for abdominal fat loss, abdominal
lean tissue loss, and arm lean tissue loss had no effect on the
total variance predicted, while addition of weight loss
removed the significance of leg fat. Multivariate equations
for insulin, glucose, and TG before and after adjustment for
weight loss are shown in Table 6.
Change in glucose was predicted by change in leg fat
(P=0.015) after adjustment for baseline glucose (P<0.001),
diabetes mellitus status (P=0.002), and study (P=0.064), with
a total of 38% of the variance accounted for. Addition of arm
and abdominal fat and lean tissue loss and leg lean tissue loss
together (P=0.02) had no effect on the significance of leg fat.
Leg fat became insignificant after the addition of change in
weight to the equation.
Use of Z scores and percentage change of the regional
depot improved the significance of the change in leg fat and
added change in leg lean mass as a minor predictor, but for
both glucose and insulin, change in leg fat was the major
predictor, while for both, change in weight removed the
significance of leg fat (data not shown).
TG, LDL, and HDL cholesterol. Changes in fasting TG were
related to changes in abdominal fat loss (P<0.017), arm lean
loss (P=0.001), diabetes mellitus status (P<0.001), and leg fat
loss (P=0.02) after adjustment for baseline TG. After addition
of change in arm fat loss, abdominal lean tissue loss, and leg
lean tissue loss, the variance accounted for showed little
change; all the predictor variables remained significant and
change in leg lean mass was significant (P=0.046). After the
addition of change in weight, only arm lean tissue loss
persisted. Sex and study played no role.
Use of Z scores and percentage change of the regional
depot did not change the results.
HDL cholesterol at 12 weeks was unrelated to change in
regional fat or lean masses and was related only to baseline
HDL cholesterol (P<0.001). Changes in LDL cholesterol were
related to changes in leg fat (P<0.001) and abdominal lean
(P=0.052) after adjustment for baseline LDL (P<0.001) and
sex (P=0.009). These changes were not influenced by the
addition of the other fat and lean regions. Use of Z scores and
percentage change of the regional depot did not change the
results.
Blood pressure. Change in SBP was predicted positively by
change in arm fat (P=0.001) and leg lean mass (P=0.007), sex

status (P<0.001) after
adjustment for baseline SBP. Arm fat persisted after adjust-
ment for weight change (P=0.043) and all the other fat and
lean regions but not fat change. However, leg lean mass
(P=0.005) remained with total fat change in the equation.
Exactly the same relationships were seen, with DBP account-
ing for 28% to 37% of the adjusted variance.
Inflammation. Change in CRP was predicted inversely by
change in abdominal fat mass (P=0.06) and baseline CRP
(P=0.002) but the variance in CRP changes accounted for was
quite small at 3%. Change in other regions made change in
abdominal fat loss nonsignificant. Change in ALT was
inversely related to changes in arm fat (P=0.08) and baseline
alanine aminotransferase (P<0.001), and addition of the other
fat and lean regions improved the relationship (P=0.02) while
gamma-glutamyl transferase changes were only related to
baseline gamma-glutamyl transferase.
Discussion
We have shown in this cohort of mostly female overweight
and obese middle-aged volunteers that leg fat was modestly
protective at baseline, with increases in HDL cholesterol in
women and lower TGs in both men and women, but leg fat
accounted for only 1% to 2% of the baseline variance in these
CVD risk variables. SBP was negatively related to abdominal
lean tissue in men. In all other regions, both fat and lean
tissue masses were related to a worse CVD profile, and leg fat
in men was positively related to CRP.
Despite the apparent protective effect of leg fat before
weight loss, loss of leg fat with weight loss was not harmful
and was directly correlated with changes in insulin and
glucose and TG before adjustment for weight loss, accounting
for about 6% to 7% of the variance. Abdominal fat loss, despite
being a major contributor to total fat loss in both men and
women, was unrelated to changes in CVD risk factors with leg
fat change in the regression model. This is in spite of the
positive relationship between abdominal fat mass and glucose
levels at baseline. The persistence of arm lean tissue loss as a
positive predictor for change in TG after adjustment for weight
or fat loss suggest that lean mass loss, at least in this region,
is not harmful. Loss of lean mass in the leg was directly
associated with reductions in SBP after full adjustment,
suggesting that strategies to maintain lean mass during
weight loss may not be required. This is completely opposite
to the observations of Okura et al,18 who found in a 14-week
weight loss and exercise study in 128 overweight and obese
women that fat tissue change in the legs correlated negatively
with percentage changes in DBP, LDL-C, fasting plasma
glucose, and the number of coronary heart disease risk
factors per subject (r=�0.17, P<0.05 to �0.26, P<0.01) in
response to weight reduction. Weight reduction was 12% with
a fat mass reduction of 26%, which was similar in all depots
with a small reduction of 3% in lean tissue, which varied from
2% to 7% depending on the region. Lean tissue changes in the
legs correlated negatively with percentage changes in SBP,
glucose, and the number of risk factors (r=�0.20 to �0.21,
P<0.05). Truncal fat changes were correlated positively with
changes in TG, LDL cholesterol, and glucose and the number
of CVD risk factors. (r=0.17, P<0.05 to 0.25, P<0.01). All CVD
risk markers were reduced significantly, varying from a 6% to
37% reduction. Our weight loss in women was only half of that
seen in this study, but it is doubtful that this alone could
account for the differences seen. In the Okura study,18 they
computed percentage changes in risk factors, whereas we
adjusted for baseline levels. Exercise may account for some of
the differences.
Our findings are in agreement with the Look AHEAD
Study,17 where in a small subset of 54 women and 38 men
there were no negative effects observed of leg subcutaneous
fat loss measured using magnetic resonance imaging. There
were positive relationships with CVD risk markers and arm
and leg fat losses despite adjustment for total weight loss,
whereas only relationships with arm lean mass losses and
changes in TG survived adjustment for weight change.
Because they did not adjust for initial levels of the risk
factors, the relationship with change in fat mass is probably
overstated, as often there will be a positive relationship
between the marker and the fat mass region at baseline and
this is not completely eliminated by adjustment for change in
weight. They found the regression coefficients for visceral
adipose tissue loss and leg fat loss were similar for
cholesterol, glucose, HbA1c, HDL cholesterol (in women only).
Only with TG and SBP were changes in leg fat found to be
unrelated.
As in the Look AHEAD study, we found that men lost more
abdominal fat than women as both a proportion of total fat
loss (22% versus 17%) and a proportion of the fat in that
region (30% versus 17%). Hallgreen and Hall26 proposed the
change of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) to the change of fat
mass (FM) is proportional to the initial ratio of VAT to total
FM, that is, dVAT/dFM=k9VAT/FM, where k is a constant.
With a constant of 1.3, the model appeared to fit a variety of
weight-loss interventions in both sexes. In our study, k was
1.8 for men and 0.8 for women, who thus had less VAT loss
than expected from this equation. The weight loss in the Look
AHEAD study at 1 year was similar to our 3-month weight
loss.
It is claimed that the benefit of energy restriction without
exercise may be limited by loss of lean body mass,27 but there
is little evidence available to support this statement. A trial
using testosterone supplementation after a very low calorie
diet–induced weight loss in obese middle-aged men produced

 a difference in fat-free mass of 3.4 kg compared with placebo
at the end of 12 months, but no differences were seen in blood
pressure, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance,
HDL cholesterol, or TG.28 In our study, loss of lean mass did not
adversely influence the beneficial effects of weight loss, and
changes in lean mass were positively related to changes in CVD
risk factors. An issue that we could not examine in this data set
was whether excessive loss of lean tissue predisposes to
weight regain and that the weight regain is proportionally more
fat than lean tissue, contributing to sarcopenia. There appears
to be little evidence that lean tissue loss differs between those
with weight stability and those with weight regain after energy-
restriction–induced weight loss.29 In the 8-year follow-up of the
Look AHEAD study, the education group suffered both fat and
lean tissue loss throughout this time, whereas in the interven-
tion group the lean tissue loss, which was maximal at the end of
1 year, became indistinguishable with weight regain from the
education group.30 Thus, the failure to regain lean tissue in the
same proportion as fat tissue seen in some studies31 would be
less significant if compared to an age-matched control group.
Limitations of the current analysis include its short-term
nature, the predominance of women, and the small number of
people with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
In conclusion, loss of fat or lean tissue from the leg, which
appears to be protective in prospective epidemiology, is
associated with benefit in terms of CVD risk factors. Loss of
lean tissue from any region does not appear to be harmful, so
worrying about minimizing lean tissue loss may be unnecessary.
