Transcription factor MEF2C regulates multiple genes linked to autism spectrum disorder
(ASD), and human MEF2C haploinsufficiency results in ASD, intellectual disability, and
epilepsy. However, molecular mechanisms underlying MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome
remain poorly understood. Here we report that Mef2c+/−(Mef2c-het) mice exhibit behavioral
deficits resembling those of human patients. Gene expression analyses on brains from these
mice show changes in genes associated with neurogenesis, synapse formation, and neuronal
cell death. Accordingly, Mef2c-het mice exhibit decreased neurogenesis, enhanced neuronal
apoptosis, and an increased ratio of excitatory to inhibitory (E/I) neurotransmission.
Importantly, neurobehavioral deficits, E/I imbalance, and histological damage are all ame-
liorated by treatment with NitroSynapsin, a new dual-action compound related to the FDA-
approved drug memantine, representing an uncompetitive/fast off-rate antagonist of NMDA-
type glutamate receptors. These results suggest that MEF2C haploinsufficiency leads to
abnormal brain development, E/I imbalance, and neurobehavioral dysfunction, which may be
mitigated by pharmacological intervention.

 M
yocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcription factors
belong to the MADS (MCM1-agamous-deficiens-serum
response factor) gene family1,2. In brain, MEF2C is
critical for neuronal differentiation, synaptic formation, and
neuronal survival3–7. Recent gene expression analyses and genetic
linkage experiments identified MEF2C as a convergent point in
multiple regulatory pathways involved in the pathogenesis of
autism spectrum disorder (ASD)8,9. We previously showed that
conditional knockout of Mef2c in nestin-expressing neural pro-
genitor cells produced mice with impaired electrophysiological
network properties and behavioral deficits reminiscent of Rett
syndrome, a neurological disorder related to autism spectrum
disorder (ASD)10. Subsequent to our study, human geneticists
mapped the overlapping regions of chromosome 5q14.3q15
microdeletions that cause neurological deficits in children, and
identified MEF2C haploinsufficiency as the cause. These patients
exhibit signs and symptoms that include ASD, intellectual dis-
ability (ID), poor reciprocal behavior, lack of speech, stereotyped
and repetitive behavior, and epilepsy11–22. The disorders caused
by MEF2C haploinsufficiency have been collectively termed
MEF2C haploinsufficiency syndrome (MCHS)22. In addition,
multiple MEF2 target genes have been identified as autism-related
genes in human pedigrees with shared ancestry23.
One emerging mechanism for ASD pathogenesis is excitation/
inhibition (E/I) imbalance in synaptic transmission, which may
occur via several molecular pathways24–27. In MeCP2-deficient
mice, a model of human Rett syndrome, impaired synaptic
function and E/I imbalance lead to hyperexcitability in the hip-
pocampus28. Furthermore, MeCP2 has been shown to influence
the expression of MEF2C29. Interestingly, the N-methyl-D-
aspartate-type glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist mem-
antine has been reported to improve hippocampal E/I imbalance
in experimental models30. Memantine is an uncompetitive/fast
off-rate NMDAR antagonist, which predominantly inhibits
extrasynaptic receptors31; it has been approved by the US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines
Administration (EMA) for moderate-to-severe Alzheimer’s dis-
ease31. However, to date, despite initial enthusiasm32, memantine
has not been found to be effective for ASD in advanced human
clinical trials, and in fact, at least one of these trials has been
terminated due to lack of efficacy33. Thus, it appears that
improved drugs may be needed if NMDAR antagonism is going
to prove worthwhile for the treatment of ASD and related con-
ditions. Along these lines, we recently synthesized an improved
series of drugs based on dual memantine-like action and redox-
based inhibition of extrasynaptic NMDARs; initially, these com-
pounds were called “NitroMemantines,” but recently the lead
compound, YQW-036/NMI-6979, was designated NitroSynapsin
because of its ability to restore synaptic number and function in
the face of multiple insults34–36.
In the present study, we develop Mef2c+/− (Mef2c-het) mice as
a model for the human MEF2C haploinsufficiency form of ASD.
We show that Mef2c-het mice display neuronal and synaptic
abnormalities, decreased inhibitory and increased excitatory
synaptic transmission in the hippocampus, suppressed long-term
potentiation (LTP), and MCHS-like behavioral phenotypes.
Importantly, we found that nearly all of these phenotypes are
rescued or mitigated by chronic treatment with NitroSynapsin.
This study therefore suggests that MEF2C haploinsufficiency
induces neuronal and synaptic abnormalities that play an
important role in ASD/MCHS-like behavioral phenotypes, which
can be improved with pharmacological treatment.
Results
Mef2c-hets display autistic behavior and reduced viability.
MEF2C protein expression is significantly lower (P < 0.01) in
Mef2c-het mice than in wild-type (WT) littermates (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1), and we observed a significant number of early
deaths in theMef2c-het mice (Fig. 1a).We counted the number of
viable animals from crosses between WT and Mef2c-het parents.
While the number of WT and Mef2c-het offspring were
approximately equal on embryonic day (E)18 (28 vs. 23, respec-
tively), the ratio of surviving Mef2c-het to WT mice was 44% and
40% by postnatal day (P)21 and 90, respectively. The difference
between survival at E18 and adult was significant (P < 0.05 by χ2).
In addition to reduced viability, Mef2c-het mice that survived to
3 months of age exhibited a decrease (~14%) in body weight
compared to their WT counterparts (31.9 ± 1.0 g for WT vs. 27.4
± 0.8 g for Mef2c-het; P < 0.001 by Student’s t test).
To determine whether adult Mef2c-het mice display MCHS-
like phenotypes, we performed behavioral tests on male Mef2c-
het mice and their WT littermates (≥3 months of age). Similar to
human patients showing cognitive impairment, Mef2c-het mice
performed poorly in the Barnes maze, a test that measures spatial
learning and memory function. Mef2c-het mice took a signifi-
cantly longer time to find the escape tunnel during training
sessions (Fig. 1b). In subsequent probe tests,WT mice, but not
Mef2c-het mice, showed a preference for the target quadrant
compared to the opposite quadrant (Fig. 1c), suggesting impaired
spatial memory in the Mef2c-het mice. Mef2c-het mice mani-
fested stereotypies, including abnormal paw-clasping beha-
vior10,37 (Fig. 1d) and repetitive head dipping on the hole-
board exploration test38 (Fig. 1e). Taken together, these results
suggest that Mef2c-het mice display a wide range of MCHS-like
phenotypes and thus represent a potentially useful animal model
for MCHS.

 MCHS, we examined gene expression of Mef2c-het mice vs. WT
littermates by microarray. We identified a total of 783 genes
whose expression levels were significantly altered in the hippo-
campus, including 394 downregulated and 389 upregulated in
Mef2c-het mice (Fig. 2a, above green line; Supplementary Data 1).
With these data, using NextBio pathway analysis, we identified
the top neuronal biogroups that were downregulated by Mef2c
haploinsufficiency in mice, including biogroups for neurogenesis,
neuronal differentiation, and synaptic function (Table 1). Con-
currently, the biogroup for regulation of neuronal cell death was
upregulated (Table 1). We confirmed the microarray results by
quantitative PCR using RNAs extracted from 3-month-old mice
(Fig. 2b). Consistent with the NextBio analysis, we found that the
messenger RNA (mRNA) level of vesicular γ-aminobutyric acid
(GABA) transporter VGAT (encoded by Slc32a1), representing
an inhibitory presynaptic marker, was significantly decreased in
Mef2c-het mice. We also examined the mRNA level of vesicular
glutamate transporters 1/2 (VGLUT1/2), representing excitatory
synaptic markers, and found that the level of VGLUT2, but not
VGLUT1, was significantly increased in Mef2c-het mice. These
results suggest possible dysfunction of both excitatory and inhi-
bitory neurotransmission in these mice.
Excitatory/inhibitoryneuronal deficits in Mef2c-hets. In histo-
logical experiments using the optical dissector as an unbiased
stereological counting method, the total number of NeuN+ cells
(i.e., neurons) was significantly decreased in Mef2c-het mice
compared to WT in the hippocampus (69.5 ± 1.6% of WT control
value, P < 0.01 by Student’s t test) and frontal cortex (79.8 ± 5.1%
of WT control, P < 0.05) (Fig. 3a, b). In contrast to NeuN+ cells,
the number of glial fibrillary acid protein (GFAP)+ cells was
significantly increased in Mef2c-het mice compared to WT in
both the hippocampus (123.0 ± 6.8% of WT control, P < 0.01)
and frontal cortex (135.16 ± 11.70% of WT control, P < 0.05)
(Fig. 3c, d).
We next performed Golgi staining in both Mef2c-het and WT
brains to determine dendritic branching patterns of pyramidal
cells in layer V of the cerebrocortex using Neurolucida software
on three-dimensional (3D) montage images (Fig. 3e). Our Sholl
analyses39 indicated that the dendritic complexity of Mef2c-het
neurons was significantly reduced, as demonstrated by decreased
dendritic interactions (Fig. 3f) and decreased total dendritic
lengths (Fig. 3g).
To further account for the decrease in neuronal number, in
addition to the known reduction in embryonic neurogenesis
mediated
by
MEF2C
deficiency10,
we
characterized
adult
neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus (DG)
of 2–3 month-old Mef2c-het mice and found a decrease in both
the number of proliferating cells (PCNA+, Fig. 4a, b) and
developing neurons (DCX+, Fig. 4a, c). The number of BrdU-
labeled NeuN+ cells was also reduced in the DG (Fig. 4d, e).
These results suggest that reduced adult neurogenesis in Mef2c-
het mice contributes to the reduction in neurons. In addition, the
development and complexity of newly formed neurons, visualized
via retroviral-mediated gene transduction of mCherry, were also
decreased in the Mef2c-het DG, as indicated by decreased somal
size and dendritic length (Fig. 4f–i). Therefore, Mef2c haploin-
sufficiency results in decreased neuronal number, impaired adult
neurogenesis, and decreased dendritic complexity in mice.
We subsequently examined synapses in Mef2c-het mice.
Consistent with the microarray analysis predicting an alteration
in synaptic proteins, quantitative confocal immunohistochemistry
showed that expression of synaptophysin (SYP), a presynaptic
marker, was significantly decreased in the hippocampus of Mef2c-
het mice (Fig. 5a, b). To better define the synaptic deficit, we
examined
expression
levels of the predominant
excitatory
synaptic protein VGLUT1 and the inhibitory synaptic protein
VGAT by quantitative confocal immunohistochemistry in the

 hippocampus (Fig. 5a). We found that expression of VGAT, but
not VGLUT1, was significantly decreased in Mef2c-het mice
(Fig. 5b). In addition, we performed immunoblot experiments on
hippocampal synaptosome-enriched lysates and found that the
levels of SYP and GAD65 (another inhibitory neuronal marker),
but not VGLUT1, were downregulated in Mef2c-het mice
(Supplementary Fig. 2a). The ratio of VGLUT1 (excitatory
neurons) to GAD65 (inhibitory neurons) was significantly
increased in Mef2c-het mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b), a sign of
E/I imbalance. Moreover, in contrast to VGLUT1 and in line with
our mRNA findings, VGLUT2 protein, which is normally
expressed only at very low levels in adult hippocampus40,41,
was significantly upregulated in Mef2c-het vs. WT (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 2c). Taken together, these findings indicate aberrant
excitatory and inhibitory synaptic protein expression in Mef2c-
het hippocampus.
To
determine
whether
these
alterations
in
E/I
marker
expression are accompanied by abnormalities in functional
synaptic
transmission,
we
recorded
spontaneous
miniature
excitatory
and
inhibitory
post-synaptic
currents
(mEPSCs/
mIPSCs) from hippocampal slices of Mef2c-het and WT mice.
From the theory of quantal release, a change in miniature
frequency reflects a change in presynaptic neurotransmitter
release or in the number of synapses, while a change in miniature
amplitude is thought to represent a change in postsynaptic
function, e.g., the number of post synaptic receptors. Mef2c-het
mice displayed decreased mIPSC frequency (manifested as
increased inter-event interval in Fig. 5c, g), in line with the
overall reduction in presynaptic VGAT, dendrites and synapses.
Reduced mIPSC amplitude was also observed (Fig. 5c, e), possibly
reflecting the fact that MEF2 levels are known to correlate with
the expression of specific GABA receptor subunits42,43. Interest-
ingly, these mice also showed an increase in mEPSC frequency
(manifested as decreased inter-event interval, Fig. 5d, f), similar to
a previous report of increased mEPSC frequency in brain-specific
Mef2c-KO mice7. This result is also consistent with our finding of
increased expression of presynaptic VGLUT2 in theMef2c-het
hippocampus. The slight reduction in mEPSC amplitude (Fig. 5d, h)
may
reflect
the
fact
that
MEF2
transcriptionally
normally
upregulates glutamate receptor expression44. The overall change
in mIPSCs and mEPSCs would be expected to result in an elevated
E/I ratio in Mef2c-het mice. Indeed, as determined by the quotient
of mean mEPSC to mIPSC values, Mef2c-het mice manifested a
116.2% increase in the E/I frequency ratio and a 25.7% increase in
E/I amplitude ratio compared to WT mice, confirming the existence
of functional E/I imbalance.
To determine if these neuronal and synaptic defects have a
deleterious effect on synaptic plasticity and neuronal circuitry, we
recorded hippocampal LTP. Mef2c-het mice exhibited reduced
LTP in the CA1 region of the hippocampus (Supplementary
Fig. 3a). Paired pulse facilitation (PPF) represents short-term
enhancement of presynaptic function in response to the second of
two paired stimuli caused by residual Ca2+ in the presynaptic
terminal after the first stimulation. For example, decreased PPF is

We observed a statistical decrease in PPF in Mef2c-het vs. WT
mice (Supplementary Fig. 3b), consistent with our observed small
increase in mEPSC frequency (Fig. 5d, f). Collectively, our results
show that Mef2c-het mice manifest a reduced number of neurons,
accompanied by synaptic deficits with decreased inhibitory and
increased excitatory synaptic neurotransmission, thus leading to
E/I imbalance.

 NitroSynapsin rescues autistic behaviors in Mef2c-het mice. In
other mouse models of ASD, decreased GABAergic neuro-
transmission has been reported to contribute to E/I imbalance,
leading to autistic-like social and cognitive deficits that parallel
those found in humanautism27. Therefore, it is possible that the
autistic/MCHS-like behavioral deficits in Mef2c-het mice may
also be triggered, in part, by reduced inhibitory neurotransmis-
sion, as well as by the increased excitatory synaptic activity found
here. In this regard, aminoadamantane drugs like the FDA-
approved drug memantine have been reported to restore altered
E/I balance30. Thus, we reasoned that chronic treatment with

 increased efficacy at the NMDAR compared to memantine, might
mitigate MCHS-like phenotypes in Mef2c-het mice via its ability
to restore E/I balance. To test this hypothesis, we treated male
Mef2c-het or WT mice with NitroSynapsin or PBS vehicle for
3 months. We then performed behavioral, electrophysiological,
and histological analyses to determine the effects of this drug.
Importantly, NitroSynapsin treatment of WT mice showed no
effects on the Morris water maze, EPSCs, or LTP36.
Neurobehavioral
tests
were
used
to
determine
whether
treatment of Mef2c-het mice with NitroSynapsin could rescue
autistic/MCHS-like behavioral phenotypes. We first performed
the Morris water maze to test the effecton spatial learning and
memory (Fig. 6a, b). During hidden platform training sessions,
vehicle-treated Mef2c-het (Het/V) mice showed impaired spatial
learning in the first 2 days by taking longer to find the hidden
platform than vehicle-treated WT (WT/V) mice (Fig. 6a).
However, Mef2c-het mice treated with NitroSynapsin (Het/N)
showed improved performance relative to vehicle during these
tests. This improvement cannot be attributed to an increase in
swimming speed per se, neither Mef2c heterozygosity nor
NitroSynapsin treatment affected swimming speed (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). Twenty-four hours after all groups of mice reached
the criteria (20 s to find the hidden platform), we performed
probe tests to examine memory retention. As shown in Fig. 6b,
WT/V mice displayed normal memory retention by spending a
significantly longer time in the target quadrant, where the hidden
platform was previously located. In contrast, Het/V mice
displayed impaired memory by not showing a preference to the
target quadrant over the opposite quadrant. Interestingly, Het/N
mice spent significantly more time in the target quadrant than in
the opposite quadrant, suggesting that NitroSynapsin treatment
normalized memory function (Fig. 6a, b). We next performed an
open field test, a 30-min test to assay general locomotor activity.
Het/V mice showed enhanced center activity (Fig. 6c), but not
total activity (Fig. 6d).This abnormal behavior was rescued by
chronic treatment with NitroSynapsin. The drug also corrected
the abnormal repetitive behavior of increased head dipping of
Mef2c-het mice in the hole-board exploration test (Fig. 6e).
Finally, we performed a social interaction behavioral test. WT/V
mice spent significantly more time in a chamber with a stranger
mouse 1 (S1) than in a chamber with a similar but empty cage
(E). However, Het/V mice showed no preference for time spent in
either chamber (Fig. 6f, g), a sign of impaired social ability. In
addition, Het/V mice paid significantly fewer visits to S1 and for
shorter times per visit than WT/V mice(Fig. 6h, i). Treatment
with NitroSynapsin improved this abnormal social behavior.
Importantly, initial feasibility experiments, in which we had
treated Mef2c het mice with equimolar memantine or NitroSy-
napsin in a head-to-head comparison, demonstrated the super-
iority
of
NitroSynapsin
in
these
behavioral
paradigms
(Supplementary Fig. 5a). In addition, NitroSynapsin treatment
did not significantly alter the social behavior of WT mice
(Supplementary Fig. 6).
Taken together, these results show that chronic treatment of
Mef2c-het
mice
with
NitroSynapsin
significantly
improved
cognitive deficits, repetitive behavior, impaired social interactions,
and possibly altered anxiety. Of note, Mef2c-het mice did not
exhibit aberrant motor behaviors except for paw clasping
(Supplementary Fig. 7a–e). However, NitroSynapsin treatment
did not improve the paw clasping phenotype (Supplementary
Fig. 7f).
NitroSynapsin effect on E/I neuronal markers and LTP. We
performed immunohistochemistry to determine the effects of
drug treatment on neuronal loss and altered expression of VGAT
or VGLUT2 in the hippocampus of Mef2c-het mice (Fig. 7a–g).
Specifically, monitored by stereology using the optical dissector
method, the total number of NeuN+ cells in the hippocampus of
Het/N mice was significantly greater than in Het/V mice (Fig. 7b),
consistent with the efficacy of NitroSynapsin in the prior beha-
vioral experiments. In addition, in our initial feasibility experi-
ments, we found a significantly greater effect of NitroSynapsin
over memantine on NeuN+ cell counts (Supplementary Fig. 5b).
We found that the reduction in NeuN+ cells in Mef2c-het mice
could be accounted for at least in part by apoptotic cell loss
because the number of neurons staining for active caspase-3 and
for terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling
(TUNEL) in the CA3 region of the hippocampus was significantly
increased in Mef2c-het mice compared to WT (P < 0.012,
Supplementary Fig. 8). Moreover, while the number of activated
caspase 3-positive and TUNEL-positive cells was increased in
Het/V,
it
was
reduced
back
to
normal
in
Het/N
mice
(Supplementary Fig. 8). This result is consistent with the notion
that apoptotic neurons observed in Mef2c-het mice were
significantly rescued by NitroSynapsin. Moreover, treatment with
NitroSynapsin also normalized the number of GFAP+ cells with
astrocytic morphology in Mef2c-het mice (Supplementary Fig. 9).
We next determined the effect of NitroSynapsin on altered
expression of E/I markers in Mef2c-het mice by quantitative
confocal immunohistochemistry. While the level of VGLUT1
immunoreactivity was unaltered by NitroSynapsin treatment,
VGAT and VGLUT2 levels as well as the ratio of VGLUT1/
VGAT or VGLUT2/VGAT were normalized by NitroSynapsin
treatment in Mef2c-het mice (Fig. 7c–g). We also found that the
numbers
of
both
parvalbumin
(PV)-expressing
basket-
interneurons and PV-positive synapses were significantly reduced
in Mef2c-het mice (Supplementary Fig. 10), while NitroSynapsin
significantly increased PV+ synapses (% area) (Supplementary
Fig. 10). These results suggest that NitroSynapsin can restore E/I
balance in Mef2c-het mice. Finally, chronic treatment with
NitroSynapsin also significantly rescued impaired hippocampal
LTP in Mef2c-het mice (Fig. 7h, Supplementary Fig. 11).
Discussion
Genetic evidence has documented the role of MEF2C in multiple
forms of human ASD, including MCHS11–22. In the current study
(as summarized in Fig. 8), we provide evidence that Mef2c-het
mice display MCHS-like behavioral deficits and thus represent a
model for studying disease pathophysiology. Mef2c-het mice
show reduced viability, the cause of which is currently unknown.
Prior work has shown that systemic Mef2c-KO mice are

genesis45; in contrast, nestin-cre-driven brain-specific Mef2c-KO
mice exhibit reduced viability similar to that observed in the
present study in Mef2c-hetmice10. It is thus possible that dysre-
gulation of MEF2C activity in the central nervous system (CNS)
is at least partially responsible for the increased lethality of Mef2c-
het mice. The Mef2c-het mice that survive to adulthood exhibit a
reduced number of neurons and synaptic impairment, specifically
E/I imbalance caused by reduced inhibitory and enhanced exci-
tatory neurotransmission. Importantly, treatment of Mef2c-het

NitroSynapsin34–36 not only corrects E/I imbalance, but also
improves autistic/MCHS-like behavioral deficits, thus providing
target validation and potential disease treatment.
We recently described the dual-functional mechanism of action
of the drug NitroSynapsin36. Although originally termed a
“NitroMemantine,” the drug is not strictly a derivative of mem-
antine, but rather a novel aminoadamantane nitrate. The dual-
functional drug acts both as an NMDAR open-channel blocker
and redox modulator; in fact, the aminoadamantane moiety

 targets the nitro payload to the second site of action, the redox
modulatory sites of the NMDAR, composed of critical regulatory
cysteine residues. Recent publications have discussed the excellent
CNS permeation of the drug, and its very good pharmacokinetic
and phamacodynamic parameters34–36. Interestingly, aminoada-
mantane compounds like memantine have been previously
shown to improve E/I imbalance30. In the case of NitroSynapsin,
its improved action over previous aminoadamantanes at inhi-
biting hyperfunctioning extrasynaptic NMDARs is thought to
represent the mechanism for regrowth of functional synapses that
were compromised35, with resultant correction of E/I imbalance
in the Mef2c-het model mice. One panoptic explanation for this
effect based on our prior findings34–36 is that NitroSynapsin
treatment, by protecting synapses, may indirectly increase
excitatory input onto compromised inhibitory neurons in Mef2c-
hets, thus enhancing their activity in order to compensate for the
E/I imbalance.
Our results also show that VGAT was substantially reduced in
Mef2c-het mouse hippocampus. In accord with this finding,
functional inhibitory synaptic transmission was reduced, as
demonstrated in recordings of spontaneous mIPSCs. In addition,
VGLUT2 was aberrantly upregulated, consistent with an increase
in excitatory neurotransmission, as documented by increased
mEPSC frequency. Consequently, dysfunctional inhibitory and
excitatory neurotransmission contribute to E/I imbalance in the
hippocampus of Mef2c-het mice. This pathophysiology may
contribute eventually to both synapse elimination, loss of LTP,
and neuronal loss. Importantly, NitroSynapsin substantially
improved all three parameters in Mef2c-het mice, with increases
in synaptic markers, LTP, and neuronal number. Moreover,
NitroSynapsin significantly improved autistic/MCHS-like beha-
viors in Mef2c-het mice. In conclusion, we demonstrate that
Mef2c-het mice represent a useful model for human MCHS. We
further show that E/I imbalance may play a role in the patho-
genesis of MCHS. Restoring synaptic plasticity and preventing
neuronal loss with an appropriate NMDAR antagonist can rescue
or ameliorate autistic/MCHS-like phenotypes in Mef2c-het mice.
These results may thus have implications for the treatment of
human MCHS and other forms of ID and ASD.
Methods
Mice and drug treatments. Mef2c heterozygous knockout (Mef2c-het) mice were
created on the C57BL/6J background by crossing mice carrying the conventional
exon 2-deleted allele of Mef2c (Mef2cΔ2)45 with their WT littermates. All proce-
dures for maintaining and using these mice were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at the Sanford Burnham Prebys
Medical Discovery Institute. In this study, only male mice were used for thebe-
havioral assays to insure uniformity (either with or without drug treatment).
Chronic treatment with memantine46, NitroSynapsin (both at 4.6 µmol/kg body
weight)35,47 or vehicle (PBS) was administered via i.p. injection, twice a day for at
least 3 months, starting at ~2.5 weeks of age. This age was chosen because mice are
still juveniles and thus treatment could begin in human at an equivalent stage. We

Mef2c haploinsufficiency leads to decreased VGAT and increased VGLUT2
protein levels, resulting in E/I imbalance (overexcitability) and synaptic
dysfunction. Mef2c haploinsufficiency also causes neuronal loss, notably a
reduced number of PV+ inhibitory interneurons. These synaptic and cellular
abnormalities are likely the underlying cause of the MCHS-like behavioral
phenotypes observed in Mef2c-het mice. The histological and behavioral
phenotypes are ameliorated by chronic treatment with NitroSynapsin

 chose the dose and duration of drug treatment based on previous studies in which
NitroSynapsin exhibited significant protective effects on neurons and synapses35,47.
Mice were randomly distributed to memantine, NitroSynapsin, or vehicle
groups before being genotyped. Laboratory workers performing the i.p. injections
and behavioral tests were blinded to genotypes. After behavioral tests, mice were
used for either immunohistochemistry or electrophysiology, as described below,
and studied in a blinded fashion.
Locomotor activity. Locomotor activity was measured in polycarbonate cages
(42 × 22 × 20 cm) placed into frames (25.5 × 47 cm) mounted with two levels of
photocell beams at 2 and 7 cm above the bottom of the cage (San Diego Instru-
ments, San Diego, CA). These two sets of beams allowed recording of both hor-
izontal (locomotion) and vertical (rearing) behavior. A thin layer of bedding
material was applied to the bottom of the cage. Mice were tested for 30 or 120 min
depending on the exact test.
Paw clasping. For the paw clasping test10,37, mice were picked up by the distal
third of their tails and observed for 10 s. They were rated in a blinded fashion with
regard to genotype based on clasping of the front and/or back paws: 0—no paw
clasping, 1—occasional clasping of front paws, and 3—constant clasping of front
paws and occasional clasping of back paws.
Barnes maze. The Barnes maze consisted of an opaque Plexiglas disc 75 cm in
diameter, elevated 58 cm above the floor by a tripod. Twenty holes, 5 cm in dia-
meter, were located 5 cm from the perimeter, and a black Plexiglas escape box
(19 × 8 × 7 cm) was placed under one of the holes. Distinct spatial cues were located
all around the maze and kept constant throughout the study. On the first day of
testing, a training session was performed, which consisted of placing the mouse in
the escape box and leaving it there for 1 min. One minute later, the first session was
started. At the beginning of each session, the mouse was placed in the middle of the
maze in a 10-cm high cylindrical black start chamber. After 10 s, the start chamber
was removed, a buzzer (80 dB) and a light (400 lux) were turned on, and the mouse
was set free to explore the maze. The session ended when the mouse entered the
escape tunnel or after 3 min had elapsed. When the mouse entered the escape
tunnel, the buzzer was turned off and the mouse allowed to remain in the dark for
1 min. When a mouse did not enter the tunnel by itself, it was gently put into the
escape box for 1 min. The tunnel was always located underneath the same hole
(stable within the spatial environment), which was randomly determined for each
mouse. Mice were tested once a day for 12 days for the acquisition portion of the
study. Note, in general, the Barnes maze is often preferred in mice over the Morris
water maze because it is less stressful. However, since we had tested rodents with
NitroSynapsin for other indications using the Morris water maze36, it was also used
here for drug testing to afford comparison.
Morris water maze. We tested spatial reference learning and memory using a
version of the conventional Morris water maze48. The mice were trained to swim to
a platform 14 cm in diameter and submerged 1.5 cm beneath the surface of the
water. The platform was invisible to the mice while swimming. If a mouse failed to
find the platform within 60 s, it was manually guided to the platform and allowed
to remain there for 10 s. Mice were given four trials a day for as many days as
necessary to reach the criterion (<20 s mean escape latency). Retention of spatial
training was assessed 24 h after the last training trial. Both probe trials consisted of
a 60-s free swim in the pool without the platform. The ANY-maze video tracking
system (Stoelting Co.) was used to videotape all trials for automated analysis.
Three chamber social interaction. This test was originally developed by the
Crawley group49 for an animal model of autism. Autistic individuals show aberrant
reciprocal social interaction, including low levels of social approach and unusual
modes of interaction. We used a social interaction apparatus consisting of a rec-
tangular, three chambered Plexiglas box, with each chamber measuring 20 cm
(length) × 40.5 cm (width) × 22 cm (height).Walls dividing the chamber were clear
with small semicircular openings (3.5 cm radius), allowing access into each
chamber. The middle chamber was empty and the two outer chambers contained
small, round wire cages (Galaxy Cup, Spectrum Diversified Designs, Inc., Streets-
boro, OH). The mice were habituated to the entire apparatus for 5 min. To assess
social interaction, mice were returned to the middle chamber, this time with a
stranger mouse (C57BL/6J of the same sex tethered to the wire cage). Time spent in
the chamber with the stranger mouse and time spent in the empty wire cage-
containing chamber were each recorded for 5 min, as was the number of entries
into each chamber. Experimental mice were tested once, and the stranger C57BL/6J
mice were used for up to six tests.
Hole board exploration. The apparatus consisted of a Plexiglas cage (32 × 32 ×
30 cm) with 16 holes in a format of 4 × 4 (each 3 cm in diameter) equally spaced on
an elevated floor. The explorative activity including the number of head-dips and
the time spent head-dipping were measured for 5 min50.
Motor behavioral tests. Balance was measured by the latency to fall off the
elevated (40 cm) horizontal rod (50 cm long) in four 20 s trials. A flat wooden rod
(9 mm wide) was used in trials 1–2 and a cylindrical aluminium rod (1 cm dia-
meter) was used in trials 3–4. In each trial, the animals were placed in a marked
central zone (10 cm) on the elevated rod. A score of 0 was given if the animal fell
within 20 s, 1 if it stayed within the central zone for 20 s, 2 if it left the central zone,
and 3 if it reached one of the ends of the bar.Traction capacity was measured over
three 5-s trials as the ability of the animal to raise the hind limbs while remaining
suspended by the forepaws grasped around an elevated horizontal bar (2 mm
diameter). A score of 0 was given if the animal raised no limbs, 1 if it raised one
limb, and 2 it raised the two limbs. Muscle Strength was determined by one trial of
60 s in which the mice were placed in the middle of the horizontal bar in an upside-
down position and the latency until falling down was measured. For the vertical
pole test, mice were placed with heads pointing upwards on a vertical wooden pole
covered with cloth tape (1 cm diameter; height: 75 cm in trial 1, 55 cm trials 2–3).
The latency to turn downward and the total time to descend to the floor over three
trials was recorded. If the mouse did not turn downwards, dropped or slipped
down, a default value of 60 s was recorded.
Hippocampal slice preparation and electrophysiology. One to six-month-old
mice were anesthetized with isoflurane overdose and decapitated. The brain was
rapidly dissected, and hippocampal slices (350 µm in thickness) were collected in
ice-cold dissection buffer containing the following (in mM): 212 sucrose, 3 KCl, 5
MgCl2, 0.5 CaCl2, 1 NaH2PO4, 26 NaHCO3, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). The CA3
region was cut to avoid epileptiform activity. Slices were placed at 30 °C in artificial
cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing the following (in mM): 124 NaCl, 5 KCl, 26
NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4). ACSF and
dissection buffer were bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2. Before recordings, slices were
placed in a submersion-recording chamber, maintained at 30 °C, and perfused with
ACSF for ≥1 h.
For extracellular field recordings, concentric, bipolar tungsten electrodes were
used to activate Schaffer collateral/commissural (SC) fibers in the hippocampal
CA1 region. Extracellular glass microelectrodes filled with ACSF (resistance
~1–3 MΩ) were placed in the stratum radiatum to measure field excitatory post-
synaptic potentials (fEPSPs). For baseline recordings, slices were stimulated at
0.033 Hz for 20 min at stimulation intensities of 30–40% of those used to elicit the
largest measured fEPSP amplitude. LTP was induced by applying high-frequency
stimulation consisting of three 100 Hz pulses (duration: 1 s, interval: 20 s). PPF was
tested by applying two pulses with interstimulus intervals ranging from 20 to
200 ms. A Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices) was used for
experiments. Data were sampled at 5 kHz and analyzed using the Clampfit 10
program (Molecular Devices).
Synaptic activity was recorded from DG granule neurons using the whole-cell
voltage-clamp technique. Data were acquired using a Multiclamp 700B amplifier
and Clampex 10.2 software (Molecular Devices). Recordings were sampled at 200
µs and filtered at 2 kHz. ACSF was used as the external bath solution, with 50 µM
picrotoxin and 1 µM tetrodotoxin (TTX) to isolate spontaneous mEPSCs, or 10 µM
6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), 50 µM (2R)-amino-5-
phosphonopentanoate(AP5), and 1 µM TTX to isolate spontaneous mIPSCs. All
solutions were allowed to equilibrate for at least 20 min prior to initiating
recording. The pipette internal solution for the voltage-clamp experiments
contained the following (in mM): 120 K-gluconate, 15 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 5 HEPES, 5
EGTA, 2 Mg-ATP, pH 7.4 (300 mOsm). mEPSCs and mIPSCs were typically
recorded for at least 3–5 min and analyzed using the Mini Analysis Program
version 6.0.3 (Synaptosoft).
Immunohistochemistry and unbiased stereological counting. Mice were per-
fused with PBS buffer and then 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS (PFA). After per-
fusion, brains were removed, and placed into 2% PFA overnight for post-fixation
and then sunk in 30% sucrose in PBS prior to freezing. Cryostat sections were cut
at a thickness of 15 µm. Sections were soaked in Antigen Unmasking Solution
(Vector) and microwaved for 30 s, followed by permeabilization with 0.25% Triton
X-100 in PBS for 15 min. Primary antibodies were incubated for 16 h at 4 °C and
fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h at 25 °C. Numerous
unstained cells in each field served as an internal control for staining specificity.
Primary antibodies included: NeuN (1:1000, mouse, EMD Millipore), activated
caspase-3 (1:500, rabbit, Cell Signaling), VGLUT1 (1:200, guinea pig, Synaptic
Systems (SYSY)), VGLUT2 (1:200, rabbit, SYSY), VGAT (1:250, mouse, SYSY),
synaptophysin (1:200, mouse, Sigma), GFAP (1:500, mouse, Sigma), PCNA (1:100,
mouse, Santa Cruz), and DCX (1:250, goat, Santa Cruz). TUNEL assay was per-
formed to assess apoptosis using the Roche in situ cell death detection Kit per
vendor’s instruction. The number of cells positive or percent area occupied by
NeuN, activated caspase-3, TUNEL, GFAP, PCNA, or DCX was counted in specific
brain regions using an optical dissector, or estimated by quantitative confocal
immunohistochemistry or optical density10,35,46.
Preparation of brain lysates and western blotting. Brain tissue was homo-
genized in 10 volumes of cold sucrose buffer (0.32 M sucrose, 25 mM HEPES,
pH7.4). After a brief centrifugation at 3000×g for 5 min at 4 °C, the supernatant

 was collected and centrifuged at 10,000×g for 12 min at 4 °C. The outer three-
fourths of the pellet was collected and re-suspended using the same sucrose buffer
by gentle pipetting, while the dark center containing mitochondria was avoided.
After a second centrifugation at 10,000×g for 12 min at 4 °C, the pellet without a
dark center was collected in cold HBS (25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) as
the synaptosome-enriched brain lysate and used for western blot experiments51.
Primary antibodies for immunoblotting included: VGLUT1 (1:1000, guinea pig,
SYSY), VGLUT2 (1:1000, rabbit, SYSY), GAD65 (1:1000, rabbit, Millipore),
synaptophysin (1:1000, mouse, Millipore), MEF2C (1:500, rabbit, Proteintech), α-
tubulin (1:20,000, mouse, Sigma), and β-actin (1:10,000, mouse, Sigma) and fol-
lowed by appropriate secondary antibodies52. Note that GAD65 was used instead
of VGAT for immunoblotting because the former antibody proved superior for-
western blots. The immunosignals were captured on Kodak x-ray film and quan-
tified using ImageJ version 1.45s (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/). All uncropped western
blots can be found in Supplementary Fig. 12.
Golgi staining and Sholl analysis. Standard Golgi-Cox impregnation was per-
formed with WT and Mef2c-het brains using the FD Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD
NeuroTechnologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After a 3D
montage of an entire cell was taken at ×40 by deconvolution microscopy and
reconstructed with SlideBook 5.0 software (Intelligent Imaging Innovations),
Neurolucida neuron tracing software (MBF Bioscience) was used to delineate the
whole cell profile and Sholl analysis was performed, as described in detail else-
where39. Cumulative dendritic intersections and dendritic lengths were analyzed.
Adult neurogenesis. To study adult neurogenesis, 8-week-old mice were injected
i.p. twice daily for 5 consecutive days with BrdU (50 mg/kg body weight) and
perfused with 4% PFA 4 weeks after the last injection. Brains were then dissected
and fixed overnight in 4% PFA, rinsed, cryoprotected, and frozen in liquid N2.
Cryosections (30 or 40 µm in thickness) were sliced on a cryostat. Standard
immunostaining procedures were used for primary antibodies with appropriate
conjugated secondary antibodies. For BrdU immunostaining, sections were pre-
treated in 2 N HCL for 30 min. Cells positive for PCNA, DCX, BrdU, NeuN, or
mCherry were analyzed in serial sections through the hippocampal DG of Mef2c-
het and WT mice. We counted positive cells under a ×63 objective using SlideBook
software. The total number of cells was counted using an optical dissector tech-
nique. Pictures were taken with the same exposure time and contrast/brightness
parameters. The mean intensity for a particular marker was determined using
ImageJ software and normalized to the average intensity of DG granule neurons. A
minimum of six pictures containing at least 40 cells was analyzed for each marker.
Microarray and NextBiogene network analysis. Total RNA was extracted from
frozen tissues prepared from the hippocampi of WT and Mef2c-het mice at
postnatal day 30, using the Qiagen miRNA kit. RNA concentrations were deter-
mined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and RNA
quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. All RNA samples included in the
expression analysis had an RNA integrity number (RIN) >8. MouseRef-8 v2
expression beadchip (Illumina) was used for the gene-expression microarray.
Microarray data analysis was performed using the R software and Bioconductor
packages. Raw expression data were log2 transformed and normalized by quantile
normalization. Data quality control criteria included high inter-array correlation
(Pearson correlation coefficients >0.85) and detection of outlier arrays based on
mean inter-array correlation and hierarchical clustering.
For pathway enrichment analysis, all genes whose expression was statistically
altered (P < 0.05) in Mef2c-het mice relative to WT mice were clustered for GO
terms using the pathway enrichment application of NextBio (Illumina, Inc.). The
background set of genes used was the entire human genome. Rank scores were
assigned by NextBio53. Genes clustered to GO terms related to neuronal
development were prioritized for validation of changes in gene expression.
Statistical analysis. Data are reported as mean ± s.e.m. Statistical tests in each
experiment are listed here, in figure legends, or in the text. All data were analyzed
using the Prism 6 program (GraphPad Software, Inc.). For data with a normal
distribution, statistical significance was determined by Student’s t test for pairwise
comparisons. An ANOVA with Tukey’s, Dunnett’s, or Newman-Keuls post hoc
analysis was used for multiple comparisons. For categorical data, a χ2 test or
Fisher’s exact test on a 2 × 2 contingency table was employed. For data not fitting a
normal distribution, non-parametric tests were used. P < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Data availability. The authors declare that all data supporting the findings of this
study are available within the article and its supplementary information files or

microarray (presented in Supplementary Data 1) have been deposited in the NCBI
GEO database under accession code GSE103298.
