ABSTRACT: Skeletalmusclepossessestheabilitytoregenerateafterinjury,butthisabilityisimpairedordelayedwith
aging. Regardless of age, muscle retains the ability to positively respond to stimuli, such as exercise. We examined
whether exercise is able to improve regenerative response in skeletal muscle of aged mice. Twenty-two-month-old
male C57Bl/6J mice (n = 20) underwent an 8-wk progressive exercise training protocol [old exercised (O-Ex) group].
An old sedentary (O-Sed) and a sedentary young control (Y-Ctl) group were included. Animals were subjected to
injections of cardiotoxin into the tibialis anterior muscle. The tibialis anterior were harvested before [O-Ex/O-Sed/
Y-Ctl control (CTL); n = 6], 10 d (O-Ex/O-Sed/Y-Ctl d 10; n = 8), and 28 d (O-Ex/O-Sed/Y-Ctl d 28; n = 6) postinjection.
Average fiber cross-sectional area was reduced in all groups at d 10 (CTL: O-Ex: 2499 6 140; O-Sed: 2320 6 165;
Y-Ctl: 2474 6 269; d 10: O-Ex: 1191 6 100; O-Sed: 1125 6 99; Y-Ctl: 1481 6 167 mm2; P < 0.05), but was restored to
control values in O-Ex and Y-Ctl groups at d 28 (O-Ex: 2257 6 181; Y-Ctl: 2398 6 171 mm2; P > 0.05). Satellite cell
content was greater at CTL in O-Ex (2.6 6 0.4 satellite cells/100 fibers) compared with O-Sed (1.0 6 0.1% satellite
cells/100 fibers; P < 0.05). Exercise conditioning appears to improve ability of skeletal muscle to regenerate after
injury in aged mice.—Joanisse, S., Nederveen, J. P., Baker, J. M., Snijders, T., Iacono, C., Parise, G. Exercise

Loss of muscle mass and strength associated with ad-
vancing age, also known as sarcopenia, can ultimately
become debilitating, with tremendous consequences for
individuals, their caregivers, and the health care system
(1). Developing interventions that target mechanisms
of age-related impairments in skeletal muscle growth/
adaptation/repair is essential in improving quality of life
of older adults. Satellite cells (SCs) are resident skeletal
muscle stem cells and play an important role in early
postnatal muscle growth, formation of new fibers, and
maintenance of muscle mass (2). Historically, it was pos-
tulated that SCs were necessary for skeletal muscle hy-
pertrophy (3); however, more recent work highlights their
redundancy in mediation of this process in rodents (4).
Although the role of SCs in muscle remodeling remains
debatable, they are essential in skeletal muscle re-
generation (4, 5) SC-depleted rodents are able to hyper-
trophy to the same extent as are wild-type animals but
their ability to regenerate skeletal muscle after induced
injury is severely impaired (4).
The regenerative process of skeletal muscle after injury
is highlighted by several overlapping phases: destructive/
inflammatory phase, repair phase, and remodeling phase
(6). During the first phase of regeneration, the destructive
phase, there is a degeneration of damaged fibers with an
influx of inflammatory (7). Influx of inflammatory cells not
only leads to a clearance of muscle debris but also has a
chemotactic role in SC migration to site of injury (7).
During the second, or regenerative, phase, SCs fuse to in-
jured muscle fibers, contributing to their repair or fuse to
each other to form new fibers (6). In the final phase, newly
formed fibers or repaired fibers grow and ultimately re-
establish contractility (6). Tibialis anterior (TA) muscle
regeneration to control levels has been consistently re-
ported at 21 d after injury in young mice (8, 9); however,
existing evidence on whether old mice have the ability to
fully regenerate skeletal muscle after injury is equivocal.
Complete regeneration of muscle after injury in old mice
has been observed (8, 10, 11), whereas others report in-
complete or delayed regeneration (12–14). More specifi-
cally, some studies demonstrate that, although early
regeneration is impaired in old mice, regeneration occurs
to the same extent in both young and old mice when ex-
amined at later time points (8, 10, 11). These studies un-
derpin the notion that delays in inflammatory response

 and angiogenesis account for early, impaired regenerative
response observed in old mice (10, 11).
Although the extent to which aged skeletal muscle is
able to regenerate is debated, it is widely accepted that SC
content and function decreases in aged rodents. Decrease
in SC content is thought to, at least in part, play a role in
skeletal muscle atrophy associated with aging (15) and
impaired/delayed regeneration in aged skeletalmuscle (8,
16–19). Age-related contraction of the SC pool likely con-
tributes to impaired regeneration but mounting evidence
suggests that the systemic environment of old mice also
plays a role in loss of SC function (13, 14, 20). Models of
parabiosis have elegantly demonstrated that when old
skeletal muscles are exposed to young systemic circula-
tion, regeneration and SC proliferation is restored (14, 20)
and deposition of fibrotic tissue is reduced (14). These data
highlight the importance of extrinsic cues from the sys-
temic environment in mediating improvements in skeletal
muscle regeneration.
Several studies have explored the adaptive potential of
aged mice to exercise stimuli. After endurance exercise
training, old mice show improvements in spontaneous
locomotion (17) and an increased lifespan (21). In addition
toimprovements in morefunctional outcomes,an increase
in SC content has consistently been reported after endur-
ance training in young (22, 23) and old rodents (17, 19).
Moreover, resistance training impedes progressive loss of
muscle associated with aging in rats (24)and prevents age-
associated shift in fiber type distribution (25).
As SCs are essential in muscle regeneration, and en-
durance training results in an increase in SC content, it
stands to reason that exercise may result in improved
skeletal muscle regeneration in old mice. In addition, as
described above, exposing old mice to a young, systemic
environment resulted in improved muscle regeneration. In
ahumanmodel,exerciseisalsoknowntohavepronounced
systemic effects, even in noncontracting muscles (26), and
may promote a more youthful systemic environment that
contributes to improved muscle regeneration.
As described above, aged rodents maintain the ability
to positively respond to exercise (17, 19, 21); therefore, the
purpose of the current study was to determine the impact
of endurance exercise training on skeletal muscle re-
generation in old mice. Study design also enabled us to
describe effects of endurance exercise on skeletal muscle
of old mice and describe the effect of aging on skeletal
muscle regeneration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Twenty-two-month-old adult male C57Bl/6J mice (n = 10;
Charles River, Framingham, MA, USA; n = 10; The Jackson
Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were subjected to an 8-wk
exercise training protocol [old exercised (O-Ex) group; n = 20]
and were euthanized at 24 mo of age. Twenty-four-mo-old
adult male C57Bl/6J mice (n = 10; Charles River; n = 10; The
Jackson Laboratory) were used as a sedentary group [old sed-
entary (O-Sed) group; n = 20] and did not take part in exercise
training. Eight-wk-old young adult male C57Bl/6J mice (n = 10;
Charles River; n = 10; The Jackson Laboratory) were used as a
young control (Y-Ctl) group (n = 20). All old mice were housed
together in cages with no more than 4 animals; O-Sed and O-Ex
animals were not housed separately. Old mice were housed in
HEPA-filtered clean cages. All young animals were housed
together with no more than 5 animals per cage. Mice were
provided with food and water ad libitum. Mice were kept on a
12-h light/dark cycle. Ethics approval was granted by the
McMaster University Animal Research Ethics Board and con-
formed to standards established by the Canadian Council on
Animal Care.
Exercise training protocol
Old mice were exercised (n = 20) on an Exer 6M treadmill (Co-
lumbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) for 40 min/session,
3 d/w for 8 wk. Every exercise session was preceded by a 10-min
warm-upat6m/minfollowedbya5-mincool-downat6m/min.
Exercise training was progressive and began at 8.5 m/min
(wk 1) and increased to 15 m/min (wk 8). Mice were encour-
aged to run on the treadmill with light electric shock and hind
limb stimulation when they stopped running.
Cardiotoxin injection
To determine the effect of aging and exercise on aged skeletal
muscle,animalsfromeachgroup—Y-Ctl,O-Ex,andO-Sed—were
subjected to bilateral injections of 50 ml (10 mM) cardiotoxin
(CTX; Latoxan, Valence, France) into the TA muscle.
Animal euthanasia
Mice were brieflyanesthetized with isoflurane (Abraxis Bioscience,
Summit, NJ, USA), then euthanized via cervical dislocation. Both
TA muscles were removed, one was frozen immediately in liquid
nitrogen for RNA analysis andthe other was mountedinoptimum
cutting temperature compound (Tissue-Tek; Sakura Finetek, Tor-
rance, CA, USA) then frozen in liquid nitrogen that was precooled
isopentane for histology experiments. For baseline comparisons,
control (CTL) mice that were not injected with CTX were eutha-
nized from each group—Y-Ctl, O-Ex, and O-Sed (n = 6 per group).
Mice from the O-Ex group were euthanized 3 d after the last bout
of exercise to minimize the possibility of observing acute exercise
effects. To observe skeletal muscle regeneration, mice from each
group were euthanized 10 d (n = 8 per group) and 28 d (n = 6 per
group) after CTX injection.
RNA isolation, reverse transcription, and
quantitative RT-PCR reaction
TotalRNAwasisolatedfromTAmusclesbyusingacombination
of Trizol (Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences, Waltham, MA,
USA) and E.Z.N.A. Total RNA Kit 1 (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross,
GA, USA). Whole TA muscles were homogenized by using 1 ml
Trizol reagent in Lysing Matrix D tubes (MP Biomedicals, Solon,
OH, USA), with FastPrep-24 Tissue and Cell Homogenizer
(MP Biomedicals) twice for 40 s at 6 m/s. Samples were stored
at 280°C until further processing. Samples were thawed, and
200 ml chloroform was added to each sample and mixed vigor-
ously for 15 s, incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and
centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. Upper aqueous phase
was removed, and RNA was isolated according to the E.Z.N.A.
Total RNA Kit manufacturer instructions. RNA was reverse tran-
scribed by usinga commerciallyavailable kit (high-capacity cDNA
reverse transcription kit; Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA, USA)

 according to manufacturer instructions. An Eppendorf Master
Cycler ep gradient thermal cycler (Eppendorf, Mississauga,
ON, Canada) was used to complete RNA reverse tran-
scription. Quantitative RT-PCR reactions were prepared by
using epMotion 5075 Eppendorf automated pipetting system
(Eppendorf) and were conducted in duplicate in an Eppendorf
realplex2 Master Cycler ep gradient S (Eppendorf). All samples
were normalized to RPS11. Fold changes in gene expression were
calculated by using the DDCt method and expressed in relation to
Y-Ctl CTL values. Primer sequences were as follows: ribosomal
protein S11: (forward) 59-CGTGACGAAGATGAAGATGC-39,
(reverse) 59-GCACATTGAATCGCACAGTC-39; VEGF: (forward)
59-TTACTGCTGTACCTCCACCA-39, (reverse) 59-ACAGGACG-
GCTTGAAGATGTA-39.
Immunohistochemistry
TA muscle cross sections (7 mm thick) were prepared
from optimum cutting temperature embedded muscle. To
determine SC content, fiber cross-sectional area (CSA),
and proportion of regenerating fibers identified as fibers
with centrally located nuclei, TA muscle cross-sections
were stained using Vector Laboratories (Burlington, ON,
Canada) mouse-on-mouse immunodetection kit per man-
ufacturer instructions, with minor modifications (over-
nightblockingstep).Slidesweretreatedwithprimaryantibodies
for Pax7 (neat; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa
City, IA, USA) and laminin (1:1000; ab11575; Abcam, Cam-
bridge, MA, USA). Pax7 was detected by using streptavidin-594
fluorochrome (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific Life Sciences), and
laminin was detected by using Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit
(1:500). Nuclei were visualized with DAPI. Images were taken
at 203 with a CoolSNAP HQ2 fluorescent camera (Nikon In-
struments, Melville, NY, USA). Images were analyzed by using
Nikon NIS elements AR software. CSA and proportion of
regenerating fibers were determined on an average of .200
fibers/animal, and SC content was determined on an average of
.700 fibers/animal.
To investigate inflammatory response, TA muscle cross-
sections were stained with cd11b, laminin, and DAPI. Slides
were fixed in 100% methanol for 5 min at 220°C, washed in
PBS with Tween 20, and incubated in 0.2% Triton X-100 for
5 min followed by a 1-h block (1% BSA and 10% goat serum).
Slides were then incubated in Alexa Fluor 647–conjugated
cd11b primary antibody (1:50; 197702; Abcam) overnight at
4°C. Slides were washed and incubated with laminin primary
antibody (1:1000; ab11575; Abcam) for 2 h at room tempera-
ture. Slides were washed, and laminin was detected by using
Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500) goat anti-rabbit. Nuclei were detected
by using DAPI. All images were acquired within 12 h of
staining. Images were acquired at 340 by using a Nikon
Eclipse 90i microscope with a QImaging fluorescent camera.
All images were acquired at the same exposure time. An area
representing ;300 fibers at CTL time point was analyzed
by using ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health,
Bethesda, MD, USA). Intensity of staining was determined
by using mean integrated density and normalized to the area of
the section as previously described (27).
Todeterminecapillarization,TAmuscle sectionswerestained
with CD31 and laminin. Slides were treated with paraformal-
dehyde (PFA) for 10 min, washed in PBS with Tween 20, and
incubated in block (1% BSA and 10% goat serum) for 90 min.
Slides were incubated in CD31 primary antibody (1:30; 28364;
Abcam) overnight at 4°C. Slides were washed and CD31 was
detected by using Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit (1:500). Slides
were refixed in 4% PFA, washed, and incubated with laminin
primary antibody (1:1000; ab11575; Abcam) for 2 h at room
temperature. Slides were washed and laminin was detected by
using Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rabbit. Nuclei were detected
by using DAPI. Capillary-to-individual fiber ratio (C/Fi) was
determined as previously described (28). Images were taken
at 320 with a CoolSNAP HQ2 fluorescent camera (Nikon
Instruments). Images were analyzed by using Nikon NIS
elements AR software. C/Fi was determined on an average of
50 fibers/animal.
Masson’s trichrome stain was used to determine collagen
content in TA muscle cross-sections. Sections were fixed in 4%
PFAfor 1 h,thenincubatedinBouin’s fixative(Sigma-Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) overnight at room temperature. Slides were
rinsed in water, incubated in Weigert’s iron hematoxylin for
5 min, washed again, and incubated in Biebrich scarlet-acid
fuchsin for 15 min. Slides were then rinsed in water, incubated in
phosphomolybdic-phosphotungstic acid (3 3 3 min), incubated
in aniline blue, dipped in water, and incubated in 1% glacial
acetic acid for 2 min. Slides were treated with graded ethanol
washes, then coverslipped. The area occupied by collagen
(stained blue) was determined and represented as a percent-
age of total area. Images were taken at 320 by using Nikon
DS-Fi1. To determine the extent of fibrosis, the area occupied
by blue staining was determined and expressed as a per-
centage of total area. Specifically, the blue area was selected
via thresholding individually on each RGB image by using
Nikon NIS-Elements AR software. Thresholding was set us-
ing the 6-point circle tool by manually choosing the lightest
and darkest blue areas in an image.
Oil Red O stain was used to stain lipids in TA muscle cross-
sections. Slides were fixed for 1 h in 4% PFA, rinsed in water, and
incubated in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 5 min followed by a 40-min
incubationin OilRed Oworkingsolution that was preparedwith
triethyl phosphate. Sections were rinsed in running water and
coverslipped. Images were taken at 340 by using Nikon DS-Fi1
within12hofbeingstained.Stainwasquantifiedbyusingsimilar
methods as previously described (29). In brief, 10 frames of each
muscle section was acquired. Analysis was completed by using
ImageJ. All images were converted to an 8-bit grayscale image,
and mean integrated density was determined for each muscle
section and corresponding background image. Mean integrated
density was then divided by total area of the muscle cross-
section. To account for background staining, mean integrated
density/area of the background was subtracted from the value
obtained for each muscle cross-section.
All analyses were performed in a blinded fashion for group
and time point. Images were coded and randomized by another
person. Analysis was completed by the same investigator for
each measure.
Experimental approach
The present study was designed to investigate whether exercise
preconditioning was able to improve muscle regeneration in old
mice. In addition, the experimental design allowed us to de-
termine the impact of exercise on old mice and the impact of age
on muscle regeneration. O-Ex mice were 22 mo old at the be-
ginning of training. Mice trained 3 d/wk for 8 wk. Mice were 24
mo old at the end of the training protocol. A subset of mice (n = 6)
were euthanizedafter trainingandTAmuscles wereisolatedand
frozen appropriately for further experiments.
To determine the effect of exercise in old mice, TA muscles
from O-Ex mice were compared with 24-mo-old O-Sed mice that
did not undergo any training. To determine the effect of aging on
muscle regeneration, O-Sed animals were compared with 8-mo-
old Y-Ctl mice. Mice were compared at baseline, before muscle
injury (CTL), 10 d after injury, and 28 d after injury.
To determine the effect of exercise training on muscle re-
generation, TA muscles isolated from Y-Ctl, O-Ex, and O-Sed
mice were compared at baseline and 10 and 28 d after injury.

 Statistical analysis
To determine the impact of exercise training in old mice, Stu-
dent’s t tests were run on all outcome measures between O-Ex
and O-Sed groups at CTL time point. To determine the impact of
aging on muscle regeneration on all outcome measures, 1-way
ANOVA was used to determine whether there were differences
between Y-Ctl and O-Sed at each time point (CTL, d 10 and 28).
To determine the impact of aging and exercise on all outcome
measures, 1-way ANOVA was used to determine whether
there were differences between each group—Y-Ctl, O-Ex, and
O-Sed—at each time point (CTL, d 10 and 28). Statistical sig-
nificance was accepted at P # 0.05. Any significant main effects
were analyzed by using Tukey’s post hoc test; a was adjusted on
the basis of the number of planned comparisons. All results are
presented as means 6 SEM.
RESULTS
Effect of exercise in old mice
Fiber CSA was determined by using immunofluorescent
staining for laminin (Fig. 1A–I). Eight wk of endurance
exercisetrainingdidnotleadtoachangeinfiberCSAofold
mice (CTL: O-Ex: 2486 6 125 mm2; O-Sed: 2275 6 155 mm2;
P . 0.05; Fig. 1J).
Extent of muscle regeneration was determined by
the number of fibers that contained centrally located
nuclei (Fig. 1A–I), a hallmark of regenerating fibers
(28). O-Ex mice had a greater number of regenerating
fibers (10 6 2%) compared with O-Sed mice (4 6 1%;
P , 0.05; Fig. 1K). Although the exercise training
protocol did not lead to an increase in CSA, it did in-
duce fiber regeneration.
SC content was determined with immunofluorescent
staining of laminin, Pax7, and DAPI (Fig. 1A–I). O-Ex
mice had significantly more SCs than did O-Sed mice
(CTL: O-Ex: 2.6 6 0.4; O-Sed: 1.0 6 0.1 SCs/100 fibers;
P , 0.05; Fig. 1L).
Effect of age on regeneration
Regeneration is impaired in old mice
Fiber CSA was significantly reduced in both Y-Ctl and
O-Sed mice 10 d after injury compared with CTL (CTL:
Y-Ctl: 2475 6 469; O-Sed: 2275 6 155 mm2; d 10: Y-Ctl:
1482 6 167; O-Sed: 1086 6 79 mm2; P , 0.05). However,
28 d after injury CSA was re-established in Y-Ctl (d 28:
2551 6 226 mm2), whereas it remained reduced in O-Sed
mice (1351 6 121 mm2; P , 0.05; Fig. 1M). In addition,
the percentage of regenerating fibers was significantly
smaller in O-Sed mice (53 6 6%) 28 d after injury com-
pared with Y-Ctl mice (76 6 5%; P = 0.05; Fig. 1N).
SC response differs between young and old mice
during regeneration
SC content was greater 10 d after injury compared
with CTL in both Y-Ctl (CTL: 2.6 6 0.4; d 10: 9.1 6 1.3
SCs/100 fibers) and O-Sed mice (CTL: 1.0 6 0.1; d 10:
5.7 6 0.8 SCs/100 fibers; P , 0.05). Twenty-eight days
after injury, SC content remained elevated in Y-Ctl
compared with CTL mice (CTL: 2.6 6 0.4; d 28: 6.7 6
1.1 SCs/100 fibers; P , 0.05). No difference in SC
content was observed in O-Sed between CTL (1.0 6 0.1
SCs/100 fibers) and d 28 (2.4 6 0.5 SCs/100 fibers;
P . 0.05; Fig. 1O).
Inflammatory response differs between old and
young mice during regeneration
Inflammation, as assessed by staining intensity of cd11b
(Fig. 2A–I), is significantly greater in the Y-Ctl group
10d afterinjury (CTL:21.16 1.5; d 10:28.0 6 1.0; P , 0.05).
There was no increase in inflammation in the O-Sed group
10 d after injury (P . 0.05; Fig. 2J, K). There was no dif-
ference in the inflammatory response 28 d after injury
compared with CTL and d 10 values in both the Y-Ctl and
O-Sed groups (P . 0.05; Fig. 2J, K).
Revascularization process during regeneration in old
and young mice
C/Fi was determined via immunofluorescent staining
of TA muscle cross-section for laminin and CD31 (Fig.
3). C/Fi was not different between Y-Ctl and O-Sed
mice at CTL and 28 d after injury (P . 0.05; Fig. 3I).
VEGF mRNA expression was increased in both Y-Ctl
and O-Sed groups 10 d after injury by ;3- and 5-fold,
respectively (P , 0.05; Fig. 3J).
Fibrosis is increased in old mice during regeneration
In O-Sed mice, fibrotic index was greater 10 d (8.1 6
0.9%) after injury compared with CTL mice (3.4 6 1%;
P , 0.05). Fibrotic index was greater in the O-Sed group
(8.1 6 0.9%) compared with the Y-Ctl group (4.6 6 1%)
10 d after injury (P , 0.05). No differences in fibrotic
index were observed in the Y-Ctl group across any time
point. Aging did not affect fibrosis, as no differences
existed at CTL between Y-Ctl and O-Sed groups at
baseline (P . 0.05; Fig. 4).
Effect of exercise on regeneration in old mice
Exercise rescues impaired regeneration in old mice
CSA was reduced in all groups 10 d after injury com-
pared with CTL (P , 0.05). CSA was re-established to
CTL values 28 d after injury in Y-Ctl and O-Ex mice, but
not in O-Sed mice (CTL: Y-Ctl: 2475 6 265 mm2; O-Ex:
2486 6 125 mm2; O-Sed: 2275 6 155 mm2; d 28: Y-Ctl:
2551 6 226 mm2; O-Ex: 2208 6 169 mm2; O-Sed: 1351 6
121 mm2; Fig. 2A). Percentage of regenerating fibers was
greater in all groups 10 d after injury (P , 0.05). In
addition, the percentage of regenerating fibers was
smaller at d 28 in the O-Sed group (53 6 6%) compared
with the Y-Ctl group (76 6 5%; P = 0.05; Fig. 5).

 SC response during regeneration in old mice
SC content was greater 10 d after injury in all groups: Y-Ctl
(CTL: 2.6 6 0.4; d 10: 9.1 6 1.3 SCs/100 fibers), O-Ex (CTL:
2.3 6 0.3; d 10: 7.9 6 1.7 SCs/100 fibers), and O-Sed (CTL:
1.0 6 0.1; d 10: 5.7 6 0.5 SCs/100 fibers; P , 0.05; Fig. 5C).
Exercise improves inflammatory response during
regeneration in old mice
Extent of inflammation was not greater 10 d after injury
compared with CTL in the O-Sed group (CTL: 23.1 6 1.3;
d 10: 26.5 6 1.1), whereas it was greater in both the Y-Ctl
(CTL: 21.1 6 1.5; d 10: 28.0 6 1.0) and O-Ex groups (CTL:
21.5 6 1.4; d 10: 29.4 6 1.7; P , 0.05; Fig. 2L). There was no
difference in inflammatory response 28 d after injury
compared with CTL and d 10 values in either groups.
Exercise improves revascularization during
regeneration in old mice
C/Fi was greater 28 d after injury in the O-Ex group only
(CTL: 2.0 6 0.1; d 28: 2.6 6 0.2 cap/individual fiber;
P , 0.05; Fig. 3K). In addition, C/Fi was greater in O-Ex
group (2.6 6 0.2 cap/individual fiber) 28 d after injury
compared with both the O-Sed (1.8 6 0.17 cap/individual
fiber) and Y-Ctl groups (1.9 6 0.1 cap/individual fiber;
P , 0.05; Fig. 3K). VEGF mRNA expression was increased
10dafterinjuryinboththeY-CtlandO-Exgroups(P,0.05;
Fig. 3L) and returned to CTL levels 28 d after injury.
Exercise does not impact lipid or collagen content
during regeneration in old mice
Aging and/or exercise conditioning during regeneration
did not significantly impact collagen expression assessed
via Mason’s trichrome staining of muscle cross-sections
(Fig. 4). In addition, aging and/or exercise during re-
generation did not affect lipid content as assessed by Oil
Red O staining in muscle cross-sections (Fig. 6).
DISCUSSION
For the first time, to our knowledge, we demonstrate that
exercise conditioning can rescue age-associated impaired
muscle regeneration. Specifically, exercise-conditioned old
mice re-established muscle fiber CSA 28 d after injury to
the same extent as young animals. Consistent with pre-
vious reports, the exercise training protocol employed in
this study resulted in increased SC content in old mice
(Fig. 1L) without leading to an increase in muscle fiber
CSA (Fig. 1J) (17, 19). Although there is no clear con-
sensus on the ability of skeletal muscle from old mice to
regenerate after injury, we observed incomplete regenera-
tion in O-Sed animals 28 d after injury (Fig. 5A).
Exercise training results in remodeling of skeletal
muscle tissue. These adaptations, in part, may explain
improvements observed in muscle regeneration in the
O-Ex group. Here, we demonstrate that exercise resul-
ted in increased SC content in old animals (Fig. 1L). SCs
are indispensable for skeletal muscle regeneration (4, 5),
and the increase in SC content in the O-Ex group com-
pared with that of the O-Sed group likely contributed to
the similar regenerative pattern observed in both O-Ex
and Y-Ctl groups. Increased SC response in the Y-Ctl
group persisted throughout the regeneration timeline,
whereas this was not observed in the O-Sed group (Fig.
1O). Upon activation, SCs proliferate; some differenti-
ate and donate their nuclei to repair damaged fibers or
fuse to one another to establish new fibers, and others
revert to quiescence to maintain the SC pool (6, 30). The
greater SC content of young animals 28 d after injury
that was not observed in the O-Sed group further
demonstrates that skeletal muscle from old animals
does not respond to injury in the same manner as young
animals. The difference in SC content 28 d after injury
likely contributed to the inability to completely restore
CSA in O-Sed animals.
A hallmark of regenerating muscle is presence of
centrally located nuclei (30). A greater proportion of
regenerating fibers were observed at CTL in O-Ex
compared with O-Sed animals (Fig. 1K), which sug-
gests that the exercise protocol was demanding enough
to require some degree of skeletal muscle adaptation/
repair.Furthermore,wereportedincompleteregeneration,
as assessed by fiber CSA, in O-Sed animals; however,
the proportion of regenerating fibers 28 d after injury
was smaller in the O-Sed group compared with Y-Ctl
group (Fig. 1B). This difference was not observed be-
tween O-Ex and Y-Ctl groups. Fewer regenerating fibers
at d 28 would suggest that the regenerative process was
slowing in the O-Sed group compared with the Y-Ctl
group, although fiber CSA was yet to be re-established to
CTL group levels. Therefore, it is possible that the
smaller fiber CSA observed in the O-Sed group was not
simply a result of a delay in muscle regeneration but
also that it may never be fully re-establish in light of the
slowing indices of regeneration observed in this
group. These findings are contradictory to previous
work that reported a re-establishment of fiber CSA
after injury in old mice (8). These authors induced
injury via notexin, which causes degeneration via a
mechanism similar to that of CTX (31); however, use of
different protocols may explain differences observed
between studies as, unlike the current study, injury
was induced in the extensor digitorum longus of fe-
male C57BL/6J mice.
An adequate inflammatory response is essential in
promotion of complete skeletal muscle regeneration after
injury. Impaired inflammation is observed in old animals
after injury (10, 11), and it is hypothesized that this may
contribute to delayed/incomplete regeneration observed
withaging.Here,wedescribe noincreasein inflammation
as assessed by cd11b expression in O-Sed animals,
whereas a greater inflammatory response in both Y-Ctl
and O-Ex animals 10 d after injury is observed (Fig. 2L).
Although no difference was observed between groups
10 d after injury, the lack of increase of the inflammatory
response in the O-Sed group may have contributed to the

 incomplete re-establishment of muscle fiber CSA28 d after
injury. Inability of O-Sed mice to increase inflammatory
cell infiltration 10 d after injury may have contributed to
impaired re-establishment of CSA 28 d after injury by
inhibitingSC response.AgreaterSCcontentwasobserved
in Y-Ctl, but not in O-Sed, mice 28 d after injury (Fig. 3C).
An appropriate inflammatory response is essential in
promotion of SC activation and proliferation after injury,
which, in turn, can maximize muscle regeneration (32).
Although our study design does not allow for early
inflammatory response to be described, a difference
was observed 10 d after injury between sedentary and
exercised animals. It is likely that earlier time points
after injury would have demonstrated an impaired
inflammatory response in O-Sed animals, which poten-
tially contributes to impaired muscle regeneration.
Revascularization is an important process during
muscle regeneration (33); however, reports that evalu-
ated capillarization in old rodents are conflicting. A re-
duction (34, 35), no change (34), and even an increase (34,
36) in capillarization during muscle fiber regeneration
have all been reported. These differences, in part, may be
attributed to the difference in rodent model used (mouse
vs. rat) and muscle examined. Exercise is able to increase
capillary content, albeit to a lesser extent, in older animals
compared with young (37). Here, we report no difference
in C/Fi between each group at baseline (Fig. 3K); however,
we report a greater C/Fi in O-Ex compared with both

 O-Sed and Y-Ctl groups 28 d after injury (Fig. 3K). En-
hanced vascularization 28 d after injury in the O-Ex group
presumably provides improved support during myo-
genesis. Reports have suggested that a spatial relationship
exists between SCs and capillaries, specifically, active and
differentiating SCs are located at a closer proximity to
capillaries than quiescent SCs (38). Considering the im-
portance of SCs during the regenerative process of muscle,
structural relationships that promote activation and pro-
liferation of SCs are likely critically important in mediation
of this process. A suboptimal capillary content during the
regenerative process will likely impact SC activation and
differentiation and, therefore, may have contributed to
impaired re-establishment of fiber CSA observed 28 d after
injury in O-Sed animals. Although no increase in C/Fi was
observed in Y-Ctl animals, it is possible that we did not
capture this increase in our d-28 time point. Previous work
has demonstrated an increase in the number of capillaries
per fiber 21 d after CTX-induced injury in mouse TA
muscle compared with baseline values; however, this
increase was not observed 28 and 42 d after injury (39).
Improved perfusion of skeletal muscle may allow for
enhanced exposure to circulating systemic environment,
whichresultsinimprovedsupportofmuscleregeneration
in exercise-conditioned animals. In addition, it is possible
that the increase in C/Fi of the O-Ex group may be a
compensatory mechanism. Muscle from old animals may
require an even greater perfusion compared with that of
young animals to fully regenerate, and we demonstrate
in the current study that VEGF expression is not up-
regulated in O-Sed animals 10 d after injury, though it is
increased in both the Y-Ctl and O-Ex groups (Fig. 3L).

 Although we report no difference in C/Fi in Y-Ctl and
O-Sed animals, our findings with respect to O-Ex animals
are supported by data that demonstrated impaired angio-
genesis associated with reduced expression of VEGF after
ischemic injury in old compared with young mice (35).
When animals are treated with a VEGF-neutralizing an-
tibody, associated increase in vascularization after exercise
is not observed (40), which suggests a role of VEGF in neo-
vascularization. An increase in VEGF mRNA expression
was observed 10 d after injury in O-Ex and Y-Ctl groups,
which suggests that muscle from these animals expressed
the appropriate cues to re-establish vascularization after
injury.Asaresultofprofoundinjuryandincompletemuscle
fiber formation, C/Fi was not analyzed 10 d after injury.
In addition to muscle fiber CSA, we also aimed to de-
termine the composition of skeletal muscle. Previous work
has reported an increase in fibrotic index in the early days
after muscle injury in old mice (14); however, when re-
generation is followed to later time points (i.e., 30 d after
notexin injury), there were no observed differences in fi-
brotic index between young and old animals (8). Our re-
sults are in accordance with both of these studies. When
determining the effect of aging on fibrosis during re-
generation, a greater fibrotic area was observed 10 d after

 injury in the O-Sed group compared with baseline (CTL),
whereas the difference was no longer apparent 28 d after
injury (Fig. 4K). However, when analyzing whether aging
and exercise had an effect on fibrosis during regeneration,
post hoc tests revealed no differences between groups or
time points. This may be a result of a lack of statistical
power. We also determined lipid content as lipid in-
filtration of skeletal muscle increases with age in humans
(41).Leeetal.(8)reportedanincreaseinlipiddepositsinold
and senescent mice 30 and 21 d, respectively, after injury.
Contrary to these results, we do not observe an increase in
lipid content after injury in old animals (Fig. 6). Content
of nonmuscle tissue (i.e., lipid and collagen) in skeletal
musclemayimpactregenerationandmayultimatelyimpair
re-establishment of fiber CSA. This seems to be especially
true in O-Sed animals. Determining whether functional ca-
pacity of O-Ex mice was improved compared with O-Sed
mice would have been beneficial in determining if re-
establishment of fiber CSA translated to functional mea-
sures,such asstrengthandfatigability.In addition,excessof
noncontractile tissue, such as adipose and connective tissue,
in skeletal muscle could also impact tissue contractility and
result in reduced functional capacity.
Skeletal muscle has an outstanding ability to fully re-
generate after traumatic injury; however, the ability of
skeletal muscle to completely regenerate after injury,
on occasion has reported to be delayed or impaired in old
animals (12–14). These findings are confirmed in the present

regeneration 28 d after injury. Here, however, we demon-
strate that 8 wk of progressive endurance training is able to
rescue impaired muscle regeneration of old mice after CTX
injury. Rescued regeneration was likely a result of increased
SC content after exercise. In addition, exercised animals
seemed to have an improved re-establishment of the vas-
cular network in response to exercise, which may have also
contributed to complete skeletal muscle regeneration ob-
served in this group. These results may also be relevant in
minimizing impact of sarcopenia in older adults. Although
the extent of muscle injury that was induced in this study is
more severe and widespread than what is observed with
normal aging, we suggest that exercise preconditioning
may improve muscle ability to repair and remodel when
faced with muscle injury and/or damage. Older adults
not only have a reduction in their SC pool but also an
attenuated acute response to stimuli (42). This reduction
in pool and function may contribute to age-associated
loss of muscle mass and impaired ability of older adults to
re-establish muscle fiber size after periods of accelerated at-
rophy induced by immobilization (43–45). Exercise pre-
conditioning, via improved SC content and an improved
systemic environment, may improve response of older indi-
viduals to various stimuli, such as periods of atrophy and/or
damage. In conclusion, exercise conditioning rescues delayed
skeletal muscle regeneration observed in advanced age.
