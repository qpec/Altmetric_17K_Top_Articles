Abstract
Objective—To determine whether lower thigh muscle specific strength increases risk of incident 
radiographic knee osteoarthritis (RKOA), and whether there exists a sex-specific relationship 
between thigh muscle specific strength and BMI.
Methods—161 Osteoarthritis Initiative participants (62% female) with incident RKOA 
(Kellgren-Lawrence grade 0/1 at baseline, developing an osteophyte and joint space narrowing 
grade ≥1 by year 4) were matched to 186 controls (58% female) without incident RKOA. Thigh 
muscle anatomical cross-sectional areas (ACSAs) were determined at baseline using axial MRI 
scans. Isometric extensor and flexor muscle strength were measured at baseline and specific 
strength (strength÷ACSA) calculated. Logistic regression assessed risk of incident RKOA 
associated with muscle specific strength (with and without adjustment for BMI).
Results—Lower knee extensor and flexor specific strength significantly increased the risk of 
incident RKOA in women (OR 1.47 [95%CI 1.10, 1.96] and 1.41 [1.06, 1.89], respectively) but 
not in men. The significant relationship in women was lost after adjustment for BMI. Lower 
specific strength was associated with higher BMI in women (r=−0.29, p<0.001), but not in men; 
whereas (absolute) strength was associated with BMI in men (r=0.28, p=0.001), but not in women.
Conclusion—Lower thigh muscle specific strength predicts incident RKOA in women, with this 
relationship being confounded by BMI. The sex-specific relationship between muscle specific 
strength and BMI provides a possible explanation why women with muscle strength deficits 
typically have a poorer prognosis than men with similar strength deficits.

Thigh muscle weakness is a common feature of individuals with radiographic knee 
osteoarthritis (RKOA). Reports on the relationship between thigh muscle strength and the 
development of RKOA have however, presented conflicting data (1). These inconsistent 
findings in relation to incident RKOA likely, in part, reflect an emphasis on gross 
measurements of muscle strength that do not consistently control for body weight (a potent 
incident RKOA risk factor) (2) or account for intrinsic muscle properties (e.g., muscle size, 
muscle coordination, and motor unit recruitment) (3).
Muscle specific strength, a measure of muscle quality (muscle strength per unit muscle 
area), is a potentially more physiologically relevant measure of strength that may more 
closely relate to RKOA outcomes (3). For example, individuals with established RKOA, 
who displayed no deficits in thigh muscle strength, had significantly poorer specific 
strength, regardless of pain status (3). In relation to incident RKOA, the influence of poor 
muscle specific strength on the risk of RKOA development is unclear but is clinically 
important, since muscle specific strength (i.e., muscle strength per unit and anatomical 
cross-sectional area [ACSA]) is a potential modifiable risk factor. Segal et al (4) observed 
that poor knee extensor specific strength did not predict incident RKOA over 30-months in 
the Multicenter Osteoarthritis (MOST) study. However, specific strength was calculated 
using entire thigh muscle mass obtained from dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and 
not specifically the quadriceps ACSA that is responsible for providing knee extensor 
strength (4).
Further, the relationship between thigh muscle weakness and RKOA onset and progression 
has typically been observed in women only, but not in men (5, 6), which may relate to a sex-
specific muscle response to obesity (7). However, whether the relationship between thigh 
muscle (specific) strength characteristics and body mass index (BMI) differs between men 
and women, and drives poorer clinical outcomes and greater likelihood of incident RKOA in 
women with muscle strength deficits is not known. Therefore, the aims of this study were to 
determine: i) whether lower thigh muscle specific strength (using ACSAs from MRI) 
increases the risk of incident RKOA in men and women (and whether this relationship is 
confounded by BMI); and ii) whether the relationship between muscle specific strength (and 
ACSAs and strength) and BMI differ between men and women. This investigation may 
identify possible mechanisms driving commonly observed sex differences in the risk of poor 
RKOA prognosis in the presence of thigh muscle weakness. We hypothesized that thigh 
muscle specific strength would predict the risk of incident RKOA in women, but not in men, 
and that this difference may, at least in part, be explained by a sex-specific response of thigh 
muscle ACSAs and specific strength to variability in BMI.

 METHODS
Participants
Participants were selected from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI), an ongoing multicenter 
longitudinal study of 4,796 subjects aged 45–79 years, designed to identify risk factors for 
RKOA incidence and progression (http://oai.epi-ucsf.org/). The OAI was approved by each 
of the study site’s institutional review board, and all participants gave informed consent.
The current ancillary study focusses on evaluating RKOA incidence; therefore, we selected 
all knees from participants who demonstrated incident RKOA over 48-month follow-up 
from the central readings of fixed-flexion anteroposterior radiographs (i.e., cases). Incident 
RKOA was defined as knees with Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG) 0/1 at baseline that 
developed both an osteophyte and joint space narrowing (JSN) (OARSI atlas JSN grade ≥1) 
by 48-month follow-up, as defined previously (8). If both knees of one participant met 
inclusion criteria, only the right knee was included. Participants needed to have both 
baseline T1-weighted axial-spin-echo MRI acquisitions of the thigh (imaging dataset 0.E.1) 
and baseline isometric maximal strength measures of the knee extensors and flexors 
available. Participants with incident RKOA were frequency matched by baseline KLG 0/1 
(approximately 30%/70%, respectively) to control participants also with baseline thigh MRI 
and thigh strength measures, but without incident RKOA at 48-month follow-up.
Muscle ACSA and strength evaluation
Using custom software developed at our institution (9), ACSAs of the knee extensors 
(quadriceps) and flexors (hamstrings) were manually segmented by a trained observer (MS) 
from a single axial baseline MRI slice at anatomically consistent locations (33% femoral 
length; distal-proximal), with good test-retest precision and sensitivity to pain (10). A 
‘convex hull’ algorithm from Open CV (http://opencv.org/) was used to delineate a ‘sling’ 
enclosing the manually segmented muscle tissue as tightly as possible, to separate 
intermuscular tissue (within the sling) and subcutaneous tissue (between the sling and outer 
thigh circumference) (9). The knee extensor and flexor ACSAs thus excluded intermuscular 
fat, vessels and fibrous tissue. Intramuscular adipose tissue could not be assessed by MRI 
and was therefore included in the ACSA measurements. Nevertheless, non-contractile 
intramuscular tissue should result in a lower specific strength value and thus be indirectly 
reflected by the target variable used in the current analysis. Maximal isometric knee extensor 
and flexor strength (best of three trials) was assessed at the baseline visit using the ‘Good 
Strength Chair’ (Metitur Oy, Jyvaskyla, Finland) at 60° flexion (10). Specific strength was 
calculated as strength per unit ACSA (N/cm2).
Statistical analysis
Differences in demographic and thigh muscle parameter data between cases with incident 
RKOA and controls were evaluated using chi-square tests for binary data and independent 
samples t-tests for continuous data, independently for men and women. Sex-specific logistic 
regression analyses were used to assess whether low specific strength increased the risk of 
incident RKOA, with and without adjusting for baseline BMI and age (primary analysis). An 
odds ratio >1 represents greater odds of incident RKOA in the presence of low specific

 strength. To provide insights into the potential sex-specific mechanisms driving incident 
RKOA, the relationships between muscle ACSA, strength, and specific strength with BMI 
were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients (secondary analysis). Correlation 
coefficients were considered weak (<0.40), moderate (0.40–0.59), strong (0.60–0.79), or 
very strong (>0.80). All analyses were performed with SPSS V.20.0. P-values <0.05 were 
considered significant.
RESULTS
Participants
Of the 5,028 OAI participant knees without RKOA at baseline (i.e. KLG 0/1), 496 case and 
control knees were identified. Of those, 372 had baseline thigh MRIs and strength 
assessment. Of the 372 participant knees (186 case knees and 186 control knees), 25 
participants had bilateral incident RKOA; in these only the right knee was analyzed (i.e., 25 
left knees excluded), resulting in a total of 161 incident case knees (161 participants) and 
186 frequency-matched control knees (186 participants) included in analyses. One-hundred 
(62%) and 108 (58%) case and control knees were female, respectively. Baseline age (61±9 
years and 60±9 years) and frequency of KLG 1 (115 (71%) and 134 (72%)) did not differ 
between cases and controls, respectively (p>0.05). Whereas a higher BMI existed in knees 
with incident RKOA, in both men (cases 29.4±3.9; controls 27.8±3.7, p=0.015) and women 
(cases 28.9±4.4; controls 27.0±4.2, p=0.001).
Thigh muscle specific strength and risk of incident RKOA
In women with incident RKOA, the 5% greater knee extensor ACSA and 7% lower knee 
extensor strength compared to control knees resulted in knee extensor specific strength 
significantly increasing incident RKOA risk in non-adjusted analyses (Table 1). In men, in 
contrast, knee extensor ACSAs and strength (and hence specific strength) were similar 
between case and control knees (Table 2). In adjusted analyses (covariates: BMI, age), low 
knee extensor specific strength trended towards remaining statistically significant in women 
(p=0.060) and remained not significantly associated with incident RKOA in men (p=0.446). 
A similar pattern of results were observed in knee flexor ACSAs, strength and specific 
strength in men and women (Table 1, Table 2).
Relationship between thigh muscle characteristics and BMI
The relationship between thigh muscle characteristics and BMI did not differ between case 
and control knees (p>0.159), therefore case and control knees were combined for this part of 
the analysis. A moderate positive association was observed between knee extensor ACSA 
vs. BMI in both men (r=0.44, p<0.001) and women (r=0.46, p<0.001). Correlation graphs 
are presented in Supplementary File. There also was a weak (but statistically significant) 
association of knee extensor strength vs. BMI in men (r=0.28, p=0.001), but not in women 
(r=0.02, p=0.805). In women, a greater BMI was weakly (but significantly) associated with 
lower muscle specific strength (r=−0.29, p>0.001), while knee extensor specific strength in 
men was not significantly associated with BMI (r=0.01, p=0.962). A similar pattern of 
results were observed in the relationship between knee flexor characteristics and BMI 
(Supplementary File).

 DISCUSSION
In this first evaluation of thigh muscle specific strength using ACSA from MRI as a 
predictor of incident RKOA, results show that deficits in knee extensor and flexor specific 
strength increase the risk of RKOA development in women only, and not in men. These 
findings in women were not significant in adjusted analyses, as the relationship between 
lower specific strength and incident RKOA risk was confounded by BMI (and age). The sex-
specific response of thigh muscle characteristics to variations in BMI reveals a possible 
explanation for the divergent risk of incident RKOA in men and women with muscle 
deficits.
Until now, the relationship between thigh muscle weakness and incident RKOA has been 
mostly based on measures of muscle torque, with inconsistent conclusions in both men and 
women (1). By obtaining thigh muscle ACSA measures alongside thigh muscle strength, we 
were able to identify measures of specific strength that significantly increased the risk of 
incident RKOA (whereas typical muscle ACSA and strength per unit parameters did not) 
(Table 1). Our results extend previous cross-sectional data showing that muscle specific 
strength is more closely related to RKOA presence than muscle strength (3), possibly due to 
adipose deposition, muscle specific strength accentuating voluntary activation deficits, 
mitochondrial dysfunction or muscle fiber disorientation.
Our results contrast other muscle specific strength data from 1,303 participants in the MOST 
cohort, in which no statistically significant relationship was observed between knee extensor 
specific strength and incident RKOA (4). However, in this previous study whole thigh 
muscle mass measured by DXA was used rather than quadriceps ACSA, suggesting that 
specific strength determined by MRI may be more sensitive in detecting the relationship 
with incident RKOA. It is also possible that the inclusion of intramuscular adiposity in the 
MRI measurement of specific strength in the current study (which was corrected for in the 
previous DXA measurement) (4) explains the different results. Nevertheless, our findings of 
the relationship between thigh muscle specific strength and incident RKOA in women 
suggests that targeting specific impairments in muscle activation to increase strength per 
ACSA may be important in women at risk of RKOA. The ability of muscle activation 
interventions, such as muscle biofeedback and neuromuscular electrical stimulation, which 
attempt to optimize muscle specific strength and in turn reduce the risk of RKOA 
development, should be a focus of future research.
Low muscle specific strength increased the risk of incident RKOA in unadjusted analysis 
(and trended towards statistical significance in adjusted analyses) in women only. These data 
add to the growing body of evidence that women, but not men, with thigh muscle weakness 
are at an increased risk of RKOA, including joint space narrowing (11), worsening knee pain 
(12), and knee replacement (6).
A high BMI is a well-established risk factor for incident RKOA in both men and women. In 
our study, a higher BMI was associated with greater thigh muscle ACSA, which, due to a 
lack of association between BMI and muscle strength, likely reflects addition of non-
contractile tissue (i.e., intramuscular adiposity) in women. In men, while a higher BMI was

 also associated with greater thigh muscle ACSA, a corresponding increase in thigh muscle 
strength occurred, likely reflecting addition of contractile tissue (i.e., muscle). This resulted 
in a lower muscle specific strength in women with a higher BMI, with this specific strength 
deficit trending towards being an independent risk factor for incident RKOA. In men, in 
contrast, not only ACSAs, but also strength was associated with a higher BMI, so that no 
relationship between muscle specific strength and BMI was observed. Similar sex-specific 
findings between knee extensor specific strength and BMI strata (from obese to moderately-
severely obese) in those with and without RKOA support these findings (7). Despite muscle 
specific strength (i.e., quality) being independent of BMI in men, it was not sufficient to 
protect men with a higher BMI from an elevated risk of incident RKOA; the risk of incident 
RKOA with an elevated BMI may thus not depend on muscle specific strength in men. In 
women, the increased risk of incident RKOA with elevated BMI may, however, be somewhat 
influenced by a reduction in muscle specific strength, whereas in men, the relationship 
between BMI and incident RKOA may be driven by other mechanisms, such as altered 
biomechanics (13) or frontal plane knee alignment (14). The divergent response of muscle to 
a high BMI in men and women may provide an explanation why women with thigh muscle 
deficits are at a greater risk of incident RKOA and generally poorer prognosis than men with 
similar muscle deficits.
Although we included a comprehensive assessment of thigh muscles (size, strength, quality), 
a limitation of the current study is the lack of an exact voluntary muscle activation measure 
(i.e., electromyography), which was not available in the OAI. Similarly, assessment of 
intramuscular fat may have provided additional insights into the sex-specific response of 
thigh muscle to different levels of BMI; however, the thigh muscle MRI sequences acquired 
in the OAI are not suited for determining intramuscular fat ACSA. Intramuscular fat was 
therefore included in the ACSA muscle measurements in the current study. While we were 
able to include ≥100 incident RKOA female cases and controls, the trend for significant 
differences in muscle specific strength when adjusted for BMI suggests that this analysis 
may have been underpowered. With greater participant numbers, the association between 
specific strength and incident RKOA may be greater. Although we studied fewer men, the 
mean differences in muscle parameters were much less, and men who developed RKOA 
were actually on average slightly stronger (approximately 2–5%), which was also observed 
recently in the progression of previously existing RKOA (15).
In conclusion, poor knee extensor and flexor muscle specific strength increased the risk of 
incident RKOA in women, but not in men, over a 48-month observational period. This 
relationship was confounded by BMI, which itself is known as a risk factor for incident 
RKOA, although currently not entirely clear by which mechanism. The response of thigh 
muscle to variations in BMI differed between men and women, with apparently more 
contractile tissue (and strength) being present in men with greater BMI, and apparently more 
non-contractile (adipose) tissue in women with greater BMI. The lower muscle specific 
strength in the presence of higher BMI in women (possibly driven by greater intramuscular 
adiposity), but not in men, may provide a possible explanation for the divergent risk of 
incident RKOA and other RKOA outcomes in men and women with muscle strength 
deficits, and in the mechanism by which BMI increases the risk of incident RKOA in men 
and women.
