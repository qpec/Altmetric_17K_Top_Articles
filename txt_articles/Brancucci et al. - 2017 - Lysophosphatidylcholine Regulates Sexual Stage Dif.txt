SUMMARY
Transmission represents a population bottleneck
in the Plasmodium life cycle and a key inter-
vention target of ongoing efforts to eradicate ma-
laria. Sexual differentiation is essential for this
process, as only sexual parasites, called gameto-
cytes, are infective to the mosquito vector. Game-
tocyte production rates vary depending on envi-
ronmental conditions, but external stimuli remain
obscure. Here, we show that the host-derived
lipid
lysophosphatidylcholine
(LysoPC)
controls
P. falciparum cell fate by repressing parasite
sexual differentiation. We demonstrate that exog-
enous LysoPC drives biosynthesis of the essen-
tial
membrane
component
phosphatidylcholine.
LysoPC
restriction
induces
a
compensatory
response, linking parasite metabolism to the acti-
vation of sexual-stage-specific transcription and
gametocyte formation. Our results reveal that ma-
laria parasites can sense and process host-derived
physiological signals to regulate differentiation.
These data close a critical knowledge gap in para-
site biology and introduce a major component of
the sexual differentiation pathway in Plasmodium
that may provide new approaches for blocking ma-
laria transmission.
INTRODUCTION
Malaria remains one of the major global public health threats,
with an estimated 200 million clinical cases and 429,000 deaths
in 2015 (WHO, 2016). Mature Plasmodium falciparum gameto-
cytes are the only stage of the malaria parasite able to establish
an infection in the Anopheles mosquito vector. Therefore, game-
tocyte formation and maturation are critical steps for successful
parasite dissemination in the human population, and major
targets of the ongoing malaria elimination agenda (Nilsson
et al., 2015).
Gametocyte densities vary during infection and increase
with disease progression, in particular during anemia (Joice
et al., 2014; Price et al., 1999). In contrast to asexual stages,
the transmissible gametocyte forms are non-proliferative and
appear largely quiescent during their development in bone
marrow and spleen (Nilsson et al., 2015). Successful parasite
transmission therefore requires balancing the investments in
asexual reproduction and gametocyte formation under variable
host conditions (Reece et al., 2009). Various parameters
have been proposed to affect the rate at which gametocytes
are produced, including host cell age (Peatey et al., 2013),
endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (Chaubey et al., 2014), anti-
malarial treatment (Buckling et al., 1999), and the presence of
extracellular
vesicles
(Mantel
et
al.,
2013;
Regev-Rudzki
et al., 2013).
On a molecular level, gametocyte formation depends on acti-
vation of a stage-specific transcription factor, AP2-G, marking
the first known step in sexual differentiation of malaria parasites

 (Kafsack et al., 2014; Sinha et al., 2014). Sexual differentiation is
generally repressed by the co-operative action of histone deace-
tylase 2 (HDA2) and heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1)—two
epigenetic factors required for keeping the ap2-g locus in its
silenced state (Brancucci et al., 2014; Coleman et al., 2014).
Upon expression, AP2-G acts as a transcriptional master switch
that induces commitment to the sexual pathway and irreversibly
primes the cell for gametocyte development in the following
intra-erythrocytic cycle (Kafsack et al., 2014; Sinha et al.,
2014). While sexual conversion rates vary across strains and
conditions and the transcriptional program activated by AP2-G
has been characterized in some detail, no external signals or up-
stream factors regulating the epigenetic control of ap2-g have
been identified.
Here we examined how parasite populations regulate entry
into the sexual pathway. We used an in vitro assay designed to
probe the effect of culture perturbations on gametocyte forma-
tion (Brancucci et al., 2015; Buchholz et al., 2011) and discov-
ered a serum factor that provides malaria parasites with essential
nutrients and controls sexual commitment upstream of AP2-G.
Our data reveal the existence of a dynamic crosstalk between
P. falciparum metabolism and gene regulation and pave the
way for systematic dissection of the pathways translating envi-
ronmental sensing into epigenetic remodeling, ap2-g activation,
and parasite differentiation.
RESULTS
A Soluble Serum Factor Reversibly Represses Sexual
Commitment in P. falciparum
Exposing parasites to spent or ‘‘parasite-conditioned’’ medium
(CM) dramatically induces sexual commitment relative to fresh
medium complemented with human serum (+SerM) (Brancucci
et al., 2015; Buchholz et al., 2011; Williams, 1999). Based on
these data, it was hypothesized that CM was either enriched in
specific secreted parasite factors or depleted of specific host
components. In favor of the former hypothesis, we have recently
demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) from CM can in-
crease sexual commitment rates (Mantel et al., 2013). Further ex-
periments confirmed that EVs can induce parasite differentiation
when applied at high concentrations (Figure 1A). However, CM
retains most of its activity after EVs have been depleted from
the medium (Figure 1B), suggesting that vesicles are not essen-
tial for gametocyte formation. Conversely, we found that the
addition of serum is sufficient to reverse the commitment-
inducing effect of CM. Consistent with a model in which gameto-
cyte formation is triggered in response to restricted host factor
availability, sexual commitment could be induced by exposing
parasites to a serum-free medium (�SerM) (Figure 1C). In
�SerM, human serum is substituted by bovine serum albumin
and a minimal set of fatty acids required for parasite survival

 (Mi-Ichi et al., 2007; Mitamura et al., 2000). Together, these data
support the hypothesis that components of human serum pre-
vent sexual differentiation and that these components are
depleted in CM. �SerM culture conditions enhance gametocyte
production across strains (Figure 1D), demonstrating that sexual
commitment is a conserved response of P. falciparum parasites
to serum depletion. Whereas the commitment-inducing effect of
�SerM conditions could be reversed by the addition of serum up
to 34 ± 2 hr post invasion (hpi), rescue attempts at 38 ± 2 hpi and
later time points were ineffectual (Figure 1E), indicating that sex-
ual differentiation is irreversibly determined between 34 ± 2 and
38 ± 2 hpi.
Identification of Lysophosphatidylcholine as the Active
Serum Component Blocking Sexual Commitment
To identify the molecule(s) present in human serum that control
parasite differentiation, we separated its components based
on polarity (Figure 2A). The resulting serum fractions were tested
for their ability to repress parasite sexual commitment. After two
iterative rounds of fractionation and biological assays, several
fractions with significant commitment-repressing activity were
identified (Figures 2B and S1A). Mass spectrometry analysis re-
vealed lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC) species to be major
components in these fractions (Figures 2B, S1B, and S1C).
Indeed, addition of LysoPC (16:0) efficiently compensated for
the absence of serum in �SerM conditions and prevented para-
site sexual commitment at a 50% inhibitory concentration of
1.73 mM (95% CI 1.13–2.65 mM) (Figure 2C).
Using a fluorescent analog of the lipid, we demonstrated that
trophozoites and schizonts, but not younger stage asexual par-
asites or gametocytes, rapidly incorporated LysoPC or metabo-
lites thereof into parasite membranes (Figures 2D and S2A).
These results are suggestive of LysoPC uptake through a para-
site-induced channel that is only active in mature asexual stages,
such as the recently characterized plasmodial surface anion
channel (PSAC) (Nguitragool et al., 2011). In support of active up-
take, we found that all LysoPC species detectable by mass
spectrometry are significantly depleted in CM compared to fresh
serum-complemented medium (Figure 2E). To determine a
possible function for serum LysoPC in receptor-mediated
signaling, as described in various eukaryotic systems (Go
´ mez-
Mun
˜ oz et al., 1999; Yang et al., 2005), we tested a series of
non-hydrolysable LysoPC analogs (Danker et al., 2010). None
of these analogs, including the previously characterized bioac-
tive compounds miltefosine and edelfosine, could block sexual
commitment (Figures 2F and S1C). Notably, LysoPC depletion
resulted in reduced parasite progeny numbers (Figure 2G).
Together, these observations suggested a metabolic link rather
than direct receptor-mediated signaling events in LysoPC-medi-
ated regulation of sexual commitment.
LysoPC Metabolism via the Parasite’s Kennedy Pathway
Is Required to Block Sexual Commitment
To investigate the role of LysoPC metabolism in sexual commit-
ment, we performed a series of heavy isotope-based metabolic
labeling assays. Following a 12-hr incubation period with 13C
palmitate- or 2H choline-labeled LysoPC, parasites were sub-
jected to extraction and liquid chromatography-mass spectrom-
etry (LC-MS) analysis. These experiments revealed that para-
sites indeed metabolized LysoPC and used it to synthesize
choline- and fatty-acid-containing products. The majority of
free choline in the parasite (68%) was labeled even in the pres-
ence of equimolar amounts of unlabeled choline (21.5 mM) in
the medium, suggesting that LysoPC is the major choline source
for P. falciparum blood stage parasites (Figure 3A and Dataset
S1). Relative metabolite quantification further demonstrated
that the levels of phosphatidic acids (PAs), diglycerides (DGs),
and some species of phosphatidylcholine (PCs) dropped signif-
icantly under LysoPC-depleted conditions (Figure 3B and
Dataset S1). PCs are the most abundant membrane lipids in
P. falciparum (Gulati et al., 2015), and PAs and DGs are their
direct metabolic precursors in the Kennedy pathway (Figure 3C).
To confirm a direct link between sexual differentiation and the
levels of PC (or its precursors, PA and DG), we attempted to
block sexual commitment by addition of these lipids to the
growth medium. However, parasites failed to efficiently access
exogenous pools of these molecules (Figure 3D), explaining their
inability to repress sexual commitment (Figure S2B). Next, we
altered the parasites’ access to Kennedy pathway substrates
choline and glucose in absence of LysoPC. Glucose is metabo-
lized into glycerol-3-phosphate, which in turn is acylated to yield
PA and DG; choline is activated into cytidine diphosphate (CDP)-
choline before reacting with glucose-derived DG to yield PC (Fig-
ure 3C). Therefore, if PC levels regulate sexual commitment, we
expected that increasing choline levels block sexual commit-
ment in the presence of sufficient glycolysis by elevating cellular
PC via the Kennedy pathway. Indeed, addition of super-physio-
logical concentrations of choline to �SerM medium prevented
sexual differentiation (Figure 3E), and this effect was dependent
on glucose levels (Figure 3F). Metabolomic analysis confirmed
that, similar to LysoPC, the added choline was incorporated
into PC and significantly increased its cellular concentration un-
der standard glucose levels (Figures 3G and S2C and Dataset
S1). In contrast to limiting levels of LysoPC and choline, glucose
depletion is not sufficient to induce commitment independently
(Figure S2D).
LysoPC Depletion Defines the Transcriptional Signature
of Sexual Commitment
To determine the impact of LysoPC depletion on gene expres-
sion in the parasite, we performed an RNA-sequencing (RNA-
seq) timecourse experiment (Figure S3A). In brief, highly
synchronous parasite populations were split at 30 ± 2 hpi and
subsequently cultured in either LysoPC-free �SerM or �SerM
complemented with 20 mM LysoPC. Parasites grown in +SerM
served as a control for conditions that inhibit gametocytogene-
sis. RNA was then collected in 4-hr increments to investigate
gene regulation during sexual commitment. Comparative tran-
scriptional profiling of two P. falciparum strains revealed a dra-
matic induction of ap2-g transcription in absence of LysoPC,
demonstrating that the lipid acts upstream of the earliest known
regulator of differentiation. We found a total of 342 genes
significantly induced in response to LysoPC depletion, while 45
genes were downregulated (Figures 4A and S3B and Dataset
S2). No significant differences were detected between para-
sites cultured in serum- and LysoPC-complemented medium

Figure S1 for details on activity and composition of fractions.
(B) Sexual commitment inhibiting activity of LysoPC-containing fractions (left panel) and LC-MS chromatograms and mass spectra of most active fractions (right

normalized to a �SerM-exposed control population. n = 3, data from a representative experiment is shown. Standard deviationsof technical triplicates are indicated.
(C) LysoPC inhibits sexual differentiation of Pf2004/164tdTom parasites (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]). Effect of 20 mM LysoPC on HB3/748tdTom
parasites is shown in grey. Sexual differentiation is normalized to �SerM-cultured control populations. n = 3, standard errors are shown.
(D) LysoPC is internalized by asexual P. falciparum parasites. Uptake was analyzed by live microscopy using TopFluor-labeled LysoPC (green), ER tracker (red) and
DNA dye Hoechst (blue). Incorporation is apparent after completion of ring stage development (upper left panel) and the label accumulates at the ER of trophozoites
within 75 s after addition of TopFluor LysoPC (lower left panel). LysoPC uptake in the parasite is quantified relative to accumulation at the erythrocyte surface (right

 (Figure 4A), demonstrating that LysoPC maintains default tran-
scription of blood-stage parasites in an autonomous manner.
On the other hand, LysoPC depletion resulted in a cascade effect
with a first set of 25 genes induced rapidly after culture condi-
tions were changed (Figure 4B). The prominent induction of
metabolism-related genes found within this group, including
ethanolamine kinase (ek), phosphoethanolamine N-methyltrans-
ferase (pmt), and genes encoding enzymes required for methyl-
donor
synthesis
(S-adenosylmethionine
synthase,
SAMS;
S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase, SAMMT), suggests a
compensatory utilization of ethanolamine as a Kennedy pathway
substrate for PC biosynthesis. Under LysoPC-limiting condi-
tions, elevated ek and pmt activity may act in concert to catalyze
production of the Kennedy substrate phosphocholine (P-choline)
from ethanolamine via stepwise phosphorylation and SAM-
dependent methylation events, ultimately securing cellular
PC levels. It has previously been demonstrated that this alterna-
tive Kennedy pathway route is indeed active in blood-stage
P. falciparum (Pessi et al., 2004).
To evaluate the metabolic changes observed by RNA-seq, we
also determined the role of key components of the Kennedy
pathway on a protein level. First, we found that specific inhibition
of the Kennedy pathway enzyme choline kinase (CK) induces
sexual commitment even in the presence of LysoPC or excess
choline and glucose (Figure 4C). This result provides direct evi-
dence that biosynthesis of PC species through the Kennedy
pathway plays an essential role in suppressing parasite sexual
differentiation. LysoPC acylation via the Lands cycle was not
assessed in this study but likely contributes to parasite PC pro-
duction (De
´ champs et al., 2010). Second, we investigated the
expression of the most highly induced metabolic enzyme,
PMT, in single cells in response to LysoPC depletion. PMT cata-
lyzes the methylation events required to produce P-choline from
the alternative substrate ethanolamine and thus likely facilitates
adaptation to LysoPC-depleted conditions. We generated an
endogenously tagged AP2-G reporter line (NF54/AP2-GGFP) in
order to mark sexually committed schizonts (Figure S4) and
used this line to quantify PMT expression by immunofluores-
cence. Confirming the RNA-seq data, imaging flow cytometry re-
vealed that PMT enzyme levels are elevated in all LysoPC
restricted cells. However, compared to asexual parasites, the
enzyme reaches significantly higher expression levels in sexually
committed schizonts (i.e., AP2-G expressing cells) (Figure 4D).
These results further corroborate the existence of an intimate
link between parasite metabolism and sexual differentiation
and suggest that sexually and asexually committed cells utilize
distinct metabolic strategies under LysoPC limiting conditions.
The events that follow this initial metabolic response are domi-
nated by a stepwise induction of epigenetic regulators, kinases,
and factors involved in cell-cycle regulation and differentiation
(Figure 4B). The presented transcriptional signature of LysoPC
depletion will allow for systematic dissection of factors and path-
ways linking environmental sensing to cellular responses and
sexual differentiation.
Loss of LysoPC-Mediated Regulation of Sexual
Commitment in the Rodent Malaria Lineage
Our data demonstrate that LysoPC depletion induces sexual-
stage-specific transcription and gametocyte formation across
P. falciparum strains. We noted that a subset of LysoPC-respon-
sive genes is specifically absent in the rodent parasite lineage
(Figure 5A). This lineage-specific difference may reflect alterna-
tive strategies in environmental sensing and sexual differentia-
tion between rodent and primate malaria parasites, including
P. falciparum. Indeed, we found that gametocyte production
by the rodent parasite P. berghei remained unaffected by deple-
tion of LysoPC (Figure 5B). However, LysoPC is essential for
normal progression of the rodent parasite P. berghei through
schizogony (Figures 5C and 5D). These results indicate that
although P. berghei requires LysoPC for proliferation, it regulates
sexual differentiation independently from LysoPC-mediated
metabolic cues. These parasites must have developed a sepa-
rate strategy to control transmission stage formation. Notably,
P. berghei parasites appear to have sexual conversion rates
that are generally higher than those of P. falciparum, and they
can commit (i.e., induce sexual differentiation) and form gameto-
cytes within the same cell cycle (Carter et al., 2013; Mons, 1986).
Together, these observations suggest fundamental differences
in the regulation of sexual commitment between the two
lineages.
Physiological LysoPC Levels during Malaria Infection
Are Conducive to Sexual Commitment
LysoPC levels in human blood plasma are in the range of 20–
100 mM, depending on the lipid species (Psychogios et al.,
2011). Interestingly, these lipids are chemotactic factors of the
(B) Levels of parasite phosphatidic acids (PAs), diglycerides (DGs), and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) are significantly increased in presence of LysoPC and
elevated lipids contain LysoPC-derived building blocks. Bars show chromatographic areas under the curve. Colors indicate the contribution of labeled and
unlabeled molecules to the total peak areas. n = 3, standard errors of the means are shown.
(C) The Kennedy pathway requires CDP-choline and DGs deriving from LysoPC and glycolysis products, respectively, for PC synthesis. LysoPA, lysophos-
phatidic acid; DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; G3P, glycerol-3-phosphate; PA, phosphatidic acid; P-choline, phosphocholine; CDP-choline, cytidine
diphosphate choline; DG, diglyceride.
(D) Live cell microscopy shows inefficient incorporation of fluorescent Kennedy metabolites PC (TopFluor-labeled) and PA (nitrobenzoxadiazole [NBD]-labeled)
compared to LysoPC (TopFluor-labeled). Scale bar, 4 mm. Representative pictures are shown.
(E) Choline inhibits sexual differentiation at super-physiological concentrations (IC50 of 207 mM; 95% CI 169–253 mM); human serum contains �10 mM choline
(Psychogios et al., 2011). Activity of choline was assayed in presence of 11.1 mM glucose in �SerM medium. n = 3, standard errors are shown.
(F) In absence of exogenous LysoPC, glucose is required in addition to excess choline to inhibit sexual differentiation, reiterating the importance of Kennedy-
mediated PC synthesis in this process. n = 3, standard deviations are shown, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, Student’s t test.
(G) In presence of glucose, exogenously added choline mirrors the effect of LysoPC and elevates levels of parasite PA, DG, and PC. n = 3, standard errors of the

 innate immune system, and their plasma levels are significantly
reduced in response to various severe infection conditions
(Drobnik et al., 2003; Ollero et al., 2011) (Figure 6A). Two recent
studies have demonstrated that various LysoPC species drop
dramatically during malaria infection, coinciding with the pyro-
genic peak (Lakshmanan et al., 2012; Orikiiriza et al., 2017) (Fig-
ure 6A). For example, the major LysoPC species in human
serum, LysoPC (16:0) drops from 106.6 mM to 26.4 mM. Similar
observations were made during infection with African trypano-
somes (Lamour et al., 2015) that also utilize plasma-derived
LysoPC for PC biosynthesis (Bowes et al., 1993). Given that
rodent malaria parasites require LysoPC for normal growth

(A) Transcriptional responses of two parasite strains (Pf2004/164tdTom and NF54; combined) to absence of LysoPC are shown (left panel). Significantly up- and
downregulated genes are highlighted in red and blue, respectively. Data show differential transcription between parasites cultured in �SerM and �SerM/20 mM
LysoPC. No significant differential expression could be detected between parasites cultured in +SerM and �SerM/20 mM LysoPC (right panel).
(B) Clustering of differentially expressed genes reveals that LysoPC depletion elicits a temporal transcriptional cascade in P. falciparum. Differential induction of
genes (�SerM vs. �SerM/LysoPC conditions) per time point is shown in a heat map (left panel) and stacked line graph (middle panel). For each time point, the
highest-enriched gene ontology (GO) term (p < 0.05) and a subset of significantly induced genes are shown (right panel). Factors involved in epigenetic regulation
and/or differentiation are marked in green.

regulating sexual differentiation. n = 3, standard deviations are shown, ** p < 0.01, *** p < 0.001, Student’s t test.
(D) PMT expression is increased in sexually committed schizonts. Enzyme levels were quantified in a time-course experiment. While PMT is generally induced
under �SerM conditions, sexually committed cells show a more prominent induction. MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; a minimum of 100 infected red blood
cells (iRBCs) were analyzed by confocal microscopy. Measurements were repeated in triplicate experiments. Stadard errors of the means are shown.

 (Figures 5C and 5D), we determined the levels of this lipid in
P. berghei-infected mice. Metabolomic analysis of serum sam-
ples revealed that certain LysoPC species dropped by up to
76% compared to uninfected controls (Figures 6B and S5). In
addition, we observed a negative correlation between LysoPC
levels and parasite density in infected mice (Figure 6C), demon-
strating that Plasmodium infection can alter systemic LysoPC
levels via parasite metabolism, host inflammation responses,
or likely a combination of the two.
Serum albumin is known to bind LysoPC, thereby regulating
availability and biological activity of this phospholipid under
physiological conditions (Kim et al., 2007). In line with this
finding, we observed that increasing bovine serum albumin
(BSA) levels from 0.39% (standard P. falciparum in vitro culture
levels) to 3.9% (physiological levels) significantly increased the
LysoPC (16:0) concentration required for preventing parasite
sexual commitment (from 1.73 mM to 21.5 mM [95% CI 17.3–
27.2 mM, Figure 6D]). Notably, this activity window is within the
physiological range of LysoPC concentrations observed during
malaria infection in humans and mice (Figures 6A and 6B). How-
ever, in vitro experiments can only provide an approximation of
active LysoPC levels in the host, where lipoproteins and meta-
bolic turnover likely reduces bioavailable LysoPC. Depending
on the exact in vivo environment, parasites may therefore already
induce sexual commitment prior to the extensive depletion of
this lipid in serum.
Moreover, sequestration in both the intra- and extravascular
spaces exposes parasites to microenvironments that show
varying LysoPC levels. For instance, we found concentrations
of LysoPC to be drastically reduced in bone marrow fluids
compared to serum of healthy mice (Figure 6E), possibly
because the majority of the LysoPC pool in plasma is bound to
albumin (Kim et al., 2007), and this complex cannot easily cross
the vascular barrier.
Altogether, these results demonstrate that P. falciparum para-
sites control sexual differentiation in response to LysoPC levels
that naturally occur in the human host.
DISCUSSION
During their life cycle, malaria parasites are exposed to various
host environments in the intermediate vertebrate and definitive
arthropod host. They have evolved sophisticated mechanisms
to sense external cues and adapt to changing environments.
For example, parasite transmission to the arthropod host coin-
cides with a drop in temperature and exposure to mosquito

 factors, triggering a final differentiation step into male and female
gametes (Billker et al., 1998). The preceding switch from the
asexually replicating blood stage to a gametocyte requires
balancing the trade-off between maximizing within-host survival
and between-host transmission under varying host conditions.
This concept of reproductive restraint is the basis for the hypoth-
esis that the switch from asexual to sexual parasite stages
is environmentally sensitive (Pollitt et al., 2011). A number of
physiological cues, as well as antimalarial drugs, have been
implicated in affecting this switch, i.e. the rate of sexual differen-
tiation. Observed effects were generally subtle and possibly
the result of a general stress response and/or selective killing
of asexual or sexual parasite stages (Buchholz et al., 2011). In
contrast, CM results in a strong and reproducible increase in
sexual conversion rates (Brancucci et al., 2015). We have previ-
ously demonstrated that part of this activity can be attributed
to the presence of parasite-derived vesicles in CM (Mantel
et al., 2013). Here, we used an optimized sexual conversion
assay (Brancucci et al., 2015) to conclusively show that the
major activity of CM derives from the depletion of the serum
lipid LysoPC. Our data demonstrate that malaria parasites utilize
LysoPC as a major substrate for phospholipid metabolism. In
P. falciparum, limited LysoPC availability acts as an environ-
mental sensor, reducing the number of daughter cells produced
by blood-stage parasites and stimulating differentiation towards
the transmissible gametocyte stage.
Comparative transcriptional profiling of P. falciparum para-
sites cultured in presence or absence of LysoPC revealed
a cascade of pathways feeding into ap2-g activation, defining
the earliest signature of parasite sexual commitment. For

(A) LysoPC levels drop during bacterial and parasitic infection in humans. The effect of different infections on serum LysoPC concentration is shown (Drobnik

(B) LysoPC levels drop during rodent malaria infection. LysoPC species were quantified in mice infected with P. berghei (parasitemia of 10%–14%) and in healthy
control mice.
(C) LysoPC levels in P. berghei-infected mice correlate negatively with parasite burden. Shown is the correlation between LysoPC concentration (different species
are indicated) and parasitemia in peripheral blood of five mice. Correlation coefficients are indicated. Concentrations of LysoPC species are normalized to
maximum concentration found across all mice (see Figure S5 for absolute quantities). Standard errors of the mean are shown.
(D) Elevated BSA levels increase the IC50 of LysoPC for sexual commitment. Higher LysoPC concentrations are required to prevent parasite sexual commitment
in presence of 3.9% BSA compared to 0.39% BSA. n = 3. Standard errors are shown.
(E) LysoPC levels are lower in bone marrow compared to serum. Shown are LysoPC levels in serum and cell-free bone marrow extracts from healthy mice. n = 5.
Standard errors of the means are shown.

enriched erythrocyte populations, and sexual differentiation was monitored for inducing (�SerM) and for non-inducing (�SerM/LysoPC and +SerM) conditions.
Each data point represents a biological replicate (mean of technical triplicates). Sexual differentiation rates were normalized to a reticulocyte-negative control
population cultured under inducing �SerM conditions.

 example, we observed that chromatin-modifying enzymes are
induced in conditions that promote sexual differentiation. While
these factors may be involved in epigenetic reprogramming, ul-
timately resulting in ap2-g activation, the identified cell-cycle
regulators may prepare the cell for the G0-like state initiated dur-
ing gametocyte development (Sinden et al., 1996). A series of
merozoite antigens were also induced under LysoPC-limiting
conditions, suggesting that sexually and asexually committed
cells show diverging host-cell tropism. Single-cell transcriptom-
ics will be required to de-convolve these transcriptional profiles
and define the true signature of sexual versus asexual commit-
ment, as well as to separate them from unrelated responses to
nutrient depletion. Interestingly, several P. falciparum genes
induced in absence of LysoPC are absent in the rodent malaria
lineage, which may explain non-responsiveness of P. berghei
to LysoPC-derived differentiation signals. One gene encodes
an ApiAP2 transcription factor (PF3D7_1222400) located close
to the ap2-g locus. Both transcription factors harbor frequent
nonsense mutations in culture-adapted P. falciparum strains
(Claessens et al., 2017; Kafsack et al., 2014), suggesting that
their loss confers a fitness advantage under in vitro conditions,
as has also been shown for the essential gametocytogenesis
factor gdv1 (Eksi et al., 2012). Likewise, in vitro conditions may
also select for mutations that interfere with LysoPC sensing,
especially when parasites are cultured under serum-free condi-
tions such as those of Albumax-complemented medium (Srivas-
tava et al., 2007).
We demonstrate that malaria parasites use LysoPC as a ma-
jor source of choline and fatty acids for PC biosynthesis and
that corresponding metabolic activity in the Kennedy pathway
is directly linked to P. falciparum transmission-stage formation.
Several scenarios may cause altered host LysoPC levels
during infection, thereby triggering metabolic restriction and
different degrees of sexual commitment. We first considered
the possibility that different host cell types and tissue compart-
ments contain different amounts of LysoPC. Consistent with a
series of reports demonstrating increased gametocyte forma-
tion at higher reticulocyte densities (Peatey et al., 2013; Trager
et al., 1999), we hypothesized that the metabolic needs of re-
ticulocytes may restrict LysoPC availability to the parasite and
hence trigger sexual differentiation. We tested this hypothesis
by culturing P. falciparum in reticulocyte-enriched blood; how-
ever, we did not observe any difference in sexual commitment
rates (Figure 6F). Our results rule out a direct effect of reticu-
locytes on gametocyte production and suggest that the
observed correlation between high reticulocyte counts and/or
anemia with increased gametocyte formation in malaria pa-
tients (e.g., Price et al., 1999) must arise from indirect host
changes rather than from a direct effect of reticulocyte infec-
tion. Alternatively, commitment could be promoted in specific
tissue compartments due to limited LysoPC availability. First,
efficient LysoPC uptake and turnover by the parasite could
generate a LysoPC sink contributing to increased local sexual
commitment at sites of vascular sequestration. In support
of this hypothesis, both symptomatic and asymptomatic
P. falciparum infections produce detectable levels of ap2-g,
but not immature gametocyte transcripts, in patient blood
(Farid et al., 2017; Pelle et al., 2015). Second, we recently
observed accumulation of immature P. falciparum gameto-
cytes in the extravascular environment of the bone marrow
(Aguilar et al., 2014; Joice et al., 2014), suggesting that early
gametocytes form either in the vasculature before homing to
bone marrow or directly in the bone marrow niche (Nilsson
et al., 2015) or both. Indeed, we found that LysoPC levels
are significantly reduced in bone marrow fluids compared to
serum (Figure 6E). Therefore, decreased LysoPC concentra-
tion in bone marrow may trigger gametocytogenesis in a tis-
sue-specific manner. Together, our data provide supportive
evidence for mutually compatible scenarios where physiolog-
ical variation of LysoPC levels regulates sexual differentiation
during P. falciparum infection.
Not only do LysoPC levels differ spatially within a host, but
systemic LysoPCs are also reduced in response to various se-
vere infection conditions (Drobnik et al., 2003; Ollero et al.,
2011), including human and rodent malaria and African trypano-
somiasis (Lakshmanan et al., 2012; Lamour et al., 2015; Orikiiriza
et al., 2017). Both Plasmodium (this study) and Trypanosoma
brucei (Bowes et al., 1993) utilize plasma-derived LysoPC for
PC biosynthesis. It is therefore possible that the synergistic ef-
fect of host immune response and parasite metabolism limits
availability of systemic LysoPC, which increases gametocyte
formation and malaria transmission, in particular during severe
disease. Indeed, LysoPC levels decrease dramatically during
the course of a fulminant mouse infection with P. berghei, and
this decrease correlates with higher parasitemia (see also Fig-
ures 6B and 6C). A similar reduction of LysoPC levels was
observed in CM of P. falciparum in vitro cultures compared
to +SerM, demonstrating high LysoPC turnover by parasites
independently of host-mediated processes. Altogether, these
findings provide the basis for testable models describing the par-
asite’s capability to vary growth and transmission in response
to altering host conditions.
Finally, the observation that LysoPC restriction results in
reduced progeny numbers emphasizes the importance of phos-
pholipid metabolism for parasite growth and survival. Indeed,
several key enzymes of the parasite Kennedy pathway have
been recognized as attractive antimalarial drug targets, including
the previously discussed PfPMT (Bobenchik et al., 2010; Pessi
et al., 2004) and PfEK, as well as PfCK (Serra
´ n-Aguilera et al.,
2016) and PfCCT (CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase)
(Gonza
´ lez-Bulnes et al., 2011). While our data revealed that
limiting LysoPC levels induce PfPMT expression specifically in
sexually committed cells, inhibition of this enzyme, either by ge-
netic disruption or using specific inhibitors, also blocks gameto-
cyte maturation and transmission to mosquitos (Bobenchik
et al., 2013). In addition, analogs of the substrate choline show
high efficacy against P. falciparum blood-stage parasites, and
several are currently tested in clinical trials (Peyrottes et al.,
2012). Our findings reinforce the observation that parasite phos-
pholipid biosynthesis represents a promising multi-stage target
for antimalarial drug development (Ben Mamoun et al., 2010).
In summary, dropping levels of host LysoPC can trigger meta-
bolic and transcriptional changes that initiate sexual commit-
ment and subsequent gametocytogenesis in P. falciparum.
This finding represents the first described host factor linking
environmental sensing to metabolic adaptation and cell-fate

 determination in response to changing host conditions in a
eukaryotic pathogen. The fundamental role of LysoPC in
P. falciparum survival, differentiation, and transmission offers
unique opportunities for novel interventions in the fight to eradi-
cate malaria.

 Parasite Cultures
P. falciparum: P. falciparum cell culture and synchronization was performed as described (Lambros and Vanderberg, 1979; Trager
and Jensen, 1976). Cultures were kept at 37�C in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM hypoxanthine (all
from Sigma-Aldrich), with 10% human serum (The Interstate Companies), 24 mM sodium bicarbonate (Sigma-Aldrich) and gassed
with 5% CO2/1% O2 and 94% N2 mixture, unless otherwise stated. Pf2004/164tdTom and HB3/748tdTom parasites were grown in
the presence of 4 nM WR99210 (Jacobus Pharmaceuticals) to select for stable episomes. The Pf2004 strain was transfected with
reporter plasmid 164tdTom to generate Pf2004/164tdTom. Consequently, this cell line expresses the fluorescent protein tdTomato
under control of the gametocyte-specific promoter of PF3D7_1016900 (Brancucci et al., 2015; Buchholz et al., 2011). Similarly, the
HB3 strain used in this study (HB3/748tdTom) expresses the tdTomato reporter under control of gametocyte-specific promoter of
PF3D7_1477700 (Buchholz et al., 2011). Experiments were carried out using a clonal Pf2004/164tdTom population, obtained by
limiting dilution. Parasites of this cell line predominantly form asexual progeny (>99%) when cultured in presence of 10% serum
(Brancucci et al., 2015). Sex ratios were not determined in this study. Serum-free medium (�SerM) was generated by complementing
RPMI-1640 (prepared as described above, w/o serum) with 0.39% fatty acid-free BSA and oleic and palmitic acid (30 mM each;
added from 30 mM ethanol-solved stocks; all from Sigma-Aldrich). LysoPC (Avanti Polar Lipids) was added to this medium to a final
concentration of 20 mM (or the indicated concentration) to generate �SerM/LysoPC medium.
P. berghei: P. berghei parasites were cultured ex vivo at 37�C in RPMI1640 supplemented with 25 mM HEPES, 100 mM hypoxan-
thine, 20% FCS, 10 mM sodium bicarbonate, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 mg/mL streptomycin (all from Sigma-Aldrich) and gassed
with 5 CO2/5% O2 and 90% N2 mixture. For mouse serum extraction and LysoPC quantification experiments, parasitemia was calcu-
lated prior to exsanguination. To this end, a drop of blood was obtained by tail vein puncture and the proportion of fluorescent
(infected) red blood cells was quantified by flow cytometry.
METHOD DETAILS
General analytical methods
HPLC was performed with an Agilent 1200 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a photo-diode array detector;
all solvents were HPLC grade. Low-resolution Mass Spectrometry data were obtained using the above system and a 6130 quadru-
pole mass spectrometer; all solvents were LC-MS grade. High-resolution Mass Spectrometry data were obtained using an Agilent
1290 LC system equipped with an Agilent 6530 QTOF mass spectrometer in full scanning positive or negative ion mode in a range of
100-1700 m/z. Instrument conditions were as follows: Gas temperature at 325�C, gas flow at 10 L/min, Nebulizer at 40 psi, Capillary
(positive) at 3500 V, Fragmentor at 120 V, and Skimmer at 65 V. Synthetic standards were used to establish retention times and char-
acteristic ionization of lipid classes (SPLASH Lipidomix, Avanti Polar Lipids; choline chloride, Sigma-Aldrich; and phosphocholine
chloride calcium salt, Sigma-Aldrich).
Serum fractionation
Human serum (45 mL) was split evenly into 4 x 50 mL polypropylene centrifuge tubes. Each tube was extracted with 25 mL of chlo-
roform/methanol (2:1). After collecting and pooling the bottom layers, the top layers were re-extracted with 20 mL chloroform. The
bottom layers were combined with the bottom layers from the first extraction, filtered, and vacuum concentrated. This lipid extract
was dissolved in 0.5 mL of chloroform and split into two aliquots. Each of these 250 mL aliquots was passed through an aminopropyl
solid phase extraction column (Supelco DSC-NH2, 1 g) that had been conditioned with 6 mL of hexanes. After loading the lipid
extract, the columns were eluted with 5 mL each of (1) hexanes, (2) hexanes/dichloromethane/diethyl ether (89:10:1), (3) hexanes/
ethyl acetate (85:15), (4) chloroform/methanol (2:1), (5) methanol, (6) methanol with 1% ammonium hydroxide, (7) methanol with
1% acetic acid, (8) water with 10% ammonium hydroxide. The common fractions from the two columns were combined and concen-
trated in vacuo.
Activity of each fraction was tested by dissolving the fractions in 4 mL of mixtures of chloroform and methanol. These solutions
were added in 2.2 mL aliquots to a glass bottom 96-well plate, the solvent was evaporated, and 220 mL of parasite culture in CM
(80% parasite-conditioned medium; as described (Brancucci et al., 2015)) was added to the residue. Fraction (4) was the most active.
It contained many lipid species, so it was further fractionated by HPLC. Half of the fraction (16 mg) was fractionated by HPLC using a
Phenomenex Luna C18 column with a flow rate 0.7 mL/min. Solvent A was water + 0.1% formic acid and solvent B was acetonitrile +
0.1% formic acid. After a 5-minute equilibration of 80% of solvent B, a 20 minute gradient was run up to 100% of solvent B. Forty
fractions of 0.5 to 1 minute were collected. Identical fractions from 15 HPLC runs were pooled, concentrated in vacuo, and re-dis-
solved in 200 mL methanol. Fractions were tested for blocking sexual differentiation as described below. Activity was found localized
to two sets of fractions, (1) fractions 13-16, and (2) fractions 23-24. These active fractions were investigated by high-resolution LC-MS
in the positive mode using a Phenomenex Kinetex EVO C18 column. Solvent A was water and solvent B was acetonitrile. A 12-minute
gradient of 80% of solvent B up to 100% of solvent B was utilized. The main components in fractions 13-16 and 23-24 were LysoPCs
(in fractions 13-16 LysoPC(16:0); in fractions 23-24 LysoPC(18:0), see Figures 2B and S1B). To confirm the activity of LysoPCs, we
purchased LysoPC(16:0), LysoPC(18:0) and LysoPC(18:1) from Avanti Polar Lipids and tested them in the previously described
gametocytogenesis assay. All three species inhibited gametocytogenesis at 20 mM.

 Analysis of LysoPC levels in mice
Serum aliquots from each sample were split into three 20 mL portions in glass vials. To each portion was added 4 mL of a 500 mM
solution of 1-O-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine(d9) (compound 4, 2000 pmol total) in methanol as an internal standard.
The samples were randomized and extracted via a modified Bligh and Dyer method (Bligh and Dyer, 1959). To each sample was
added 0.5 mL of 2 M NaCl and 1.9 mL of 1:2 chloroform/methanol. After mixing the samples by vortex and incubation at room tem-
perature for 15 minutes, 0.6 mL of water and 0.6 mL of chloroform were added. The layers were separated by centrifugation, and the
lower layer was collected. The upper layer was re-extracted with another 0.8 mL of chloroform, and the lower layer was collected and
combined with the first. The samples were dried in a speedvac concentrator, and redissolved in 75 mL of 2:1 isopropanol/methanol.
High-resolution LC-MS was performed in both positive mode and negative mode using a Phenomenex Luna C5 column. Solvent A
was 95% water, 5% methanol, 0.1% formic acid, and 5 mM ammonium formate; solvent B was 60% isopropanol, 35% methanol, 5%
water, 0.1% formic acid, and 5 mM ammonium formate. After injection of 5 mL, solvent A was pumped at 0.1 mL/min for five minutes,
after which the flow rate was increased to 0.4 mL/min, and a 40-minute linear gradient was run from 20% solvent B to 100% solvent B.
The LysoPC peaks were quantified by integration of [M+H]+ peaks in Agilent MassHunter software and plotted against parasitemia.
Comparison of LysoPC in mouse serum and bone marrow
Analysis was performed essentially as described above with the following exceptions. One 3 mL aliquot of serum from each of five
mice was diluted to 0.2 mL and added to 0.3 mL of 2M NaCl (instead of 20 mL aliquots added to 0.5 mL of 2 M NaCl). Cell-free
bone marrow dilutions were obtained by extracting bone marrow from the femur and tibia of both lower extremities of each mouse.
The bone marrow was collected in 0.5 mL of PBS, and its weight recorded using a high sensitivity scale, prior to disruption using an
insulin needle followed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was recovered and weighed following centrifu-
gation to determine the percentage of the collected material. A 0.2 mL aliquot of the diluted cell-free bone marrow from each of five
mice was added to 0.3 mL of 2 M NaCl. To all 10 samples (5 serum, 5 bone marrow) 4 mL of a 25 mM solution of 1-O-palmitoyl-sn-
glycero-3-phosphocholine(d9) (compound 4, 100 pmol total) were added in methanol as an internal standard. Extractions and LC-MS
analyses were performed as described above. To calculate the concentration of LysoPCs in undiluted bone marrow, each value was
multiplied by the dilution factor (200x).
Synthesis of labeled LysoPC(16:0) species
Overview:
Two heavy-atom labeled LysoPC(16:0) analogs (d9-choline and 13C2-palmitate) were synthesized following the protocol published by
Lindberg et al. (Lindberg et al., 2002):
Labeled LysoPC(16:0) analogs:
General reaction scheme:
Generally, reactions were carried out in flame-dried glassware under Argon. Anhydrous solvents were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich. 13C2-labeled palmitic acid was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, and d9-labeled choline chloride was pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich. All other reagents were also purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Choline tosylate was produced from choline
chloride by passing through ion exchange resin (Amberlite IRN78, hydroxyl form) followed by acidification with p-toluenesulfonic acid
and crystallization from acetone.

Cell 171, 1532–1544.e1–e10, December 14, 2017
 S-glycidol (0.60 mL, 0.67 g, 9.0 mmol) and N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA, 6.5 mL, 4.8 g, 9.5 mmol) were added to 20 mL anhy-
drous CHCl3. Phosphorus(V) oxychloride (POCl3, 0.85 mL, 1.4 g, 9.1 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution stirring in an ice-water
bath. After stirring at 0�C for 2 hours, unlabeled choline tosylate (3.0 g, 10.6 mmol) was added, followed by pyridine (2.0 mL, 2.0 g,
25 mmol). After pyridine addition, the reaction turned magenta. The flask was removed from the ice-water bath and allowed to stir at
room temperature for 5 hours. The reaction was quenched with 1.0 mL water and allowed to stir at room temperature for 1 hour. The
mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation. Almost half of this crude product (6.0 g out of 13.5 g) was purified by silica gel chro-
matography, eluting with 70% ethanol in water (Rf �0.2). Fractions containing the product were combined, concentrated by rotary
evaporation, and centrifuged to remove particles. The supernatant was concentrated to yield thick oil (R)-glycidyl phosphocholine
(compound 1, 400 mg, 1.67 mmol, 42%).

S-glycidol (0.20 mL, 0.22 g, 3.1 mmol) and N,N-Diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA, 2.17 mL, 1.6 g, 12.5 mmol) were added to 7 mL
anhydrous CHCl3. Phosphorus(V) oxychloride (POCl3, 0.28 mL, 0.46 g, 3.0 mmol) was added dropwise to the solution stirring in
an ice-water bath. After stirring at 0�C for 2 hours, d9-labeled choline tosylate (1.0 g, 3.5 mmol) was added, followed by pyridine
(0.67 mL, 0.66 g, 8.3 mmol). After pyridine addition, the reaction turned magenta. The flask was removed from the ice-water bath
and allowed to stir at room temperature for 3 hours. The reaction was quenched with 0.3 mL water and allowed to stir at room
temperature for 1 hour. The mixture was concentrated by rotary evaporation and purified by silica gel chromatography, eluting
with 70% ethanol in water. Fractions containing the product were combined, concentrated by rotary evaporation, and centrifuged
to remove particles. The supernatant was concentrated to yield thick oil (R)-glycidyl phosphocholine(d9) (compound 2, 323 mg,

Synthesis of 1-O-palmitoyl(1,2-13C2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (3):
Palmitic acid-1,2-13C2 (206 mg, 0.80 mmol), cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3, 265 mg, 0.81 mmol), and the unlabeled (R)-glycidyl phos-
phocholine (1) (200 mg, 0.84 mmol) were dissolved in 10 mL dimethylformamide and stirred at 80�C for 6.5 hours. The reaction
mixture was cooled on ice and added to 40 mL of 20% methanol in water, which was loaded onto a C18 Seppak cartridge (Waters
WAT043345, 35 cc, 10 g) that had been activated with methanol and equilibrated with 20% methanol in water. The cartridge
was eluted with 20 mL each of 20%, 50%, and 80% methanol in water, and finally with 30 mL 100% methanol. The product
1-O-palmitoyl(1,2-13C2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine was present in the 100% methanol elution, which was further purified by
reverse phase HPLC using a phenyl-hexyl resin (Phenomenex 00G-4257-N0, Luna 5 mm, 100 A
˚ , 250 x 10 mm). Solvent A was water,
and solvent B was acetonitrile. After a 5 minute equilibration at 50% B, a 15 minute gradient from 50% B to 100% B eluted pure
product 1-O-palmitoyl(1,2-13C2)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (3), which was concentrated to yield a white powder (48 mg,

Synthesis of 1-O-Palmitoyl-2-methoxy-glycero-3-phosphocholine (5):
OMe-LysoPC analog (compound 5) was synthesized by modification of the procedure described by Lindberg et al. (Lindberg et al.,
2002). The starting material 1-O-palmitoyl-2-methoxyglycerol was prepared from racemic glycidol as described (Rytczak et al.,
2013). Phosphorus oxychloride (0.155 mL, 1.66 mmol) was added dropwise at 0�C to a solution of 1-O-palmitoyl-2-methoxy-glycerol
280 mg, 0.83 mmol) and ethyl N,N-diisopropylamine (0.29 mL, 1.66 mmol) in dichloromethane (10 mL) with constant stirring. After
2 hours, pyridine (0.27 mL, 3.32 mmol) and choline tosylate (457 mg, 1.66 mmol) were added, and the mixture was allowed to attain
room temperature. The reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. Next, 0.2 mL water were added, and stirred for an
additional 1.5 hours. After evaporation, the crude product was purified by silica gel flash column chromatography with a chloroform-
methanol gradient (from 30 to 100% MeOH, v/v) followed by a methanol-water gradient (from 0 to 50% water, v/v) as eluent. The final
1-O-palmitoyl-2-OMe-LPC (compound 5) was isolated after lyophilization. Yield 105.7 mg (25%). 1H NMR (250 MHz, Methanol-d4)

Metabolism of labeled LysoPC and choline
Incorporation experiments:
To test incorporation and metabolism of exogenously added LysoPC, P. falciparum parasites were grown for 12 hours (28±2 hpi to
40±2 hpi) in �SerM medium (100 mL, 5% hematocrit, 2% parasitemia) either in the absence or presence of 20 mM LysoPC(16:0)
(Avanti Polar Lipids), 20 mM 13C2-palmitate-labeled-LysoPC(16:0) (synthesized above, compound 3), or 20 mM d9-choline-labeled-
LysoPC(16:0) (synthesized above, compound 4). Cultures were pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 300 g. Erythrocytes were lysed
in ice-cold 0.015% saponin (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 10 min. After pelleting (5 min, 3000 g, 4�C), parasites were washed 5 times in
10 mL ice cold PBS. After the final wash, the parasite pellet was snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80�C.
The same procedure was followed for characterizing incorporation and metabolism of exogenously added choline. Parasites were
grown in �SerM medium either in the absence or presence of 1 mM choline chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) or 1 mM d9-choline chloride
(Sigma-Aldrich).

 Analysis of lipids:
Pellets were extracted following a previously described protocol (Gulati et al., 2015). Briefly, pellets were thawed, diluted with 600 mL
water, split into 3 aliquots of 100 mL each in glass vials, and their order was randomized. To each 100 mL aliquot 1.33 mL of 3 M KCl and
0.5 mL methanol were added. Samples were vortexed and sonicated to homogeneity, and then extracted with 2 mL of isopropanol/
hexanes (1:2). The top layer was collected and the bottom layer was re-extracted with 2 mL isopropanol/hexanes. The combined
organic layers were dried in vacuo, resuspended in 500 mL hexanes, dried, resuspended in 300 mL methanol, dried, and resuspended
in 200 mL chloroform for LC-MS analysis (5 mL injections). High-resolution LC-MS was performed in both positive mode and negative
mode using a Phenomenex Luna C5 column. Solvent A was 95% water, 5% methanol, 0.1% formic acid, and 5 mM ammonium
formate; solvent B was 60% isopropanol, 35% methanol, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid, and 5 mM ammonium formate. After injection,
solvent A was pumped at 0.1 mL/min for five minutes, after which the flow rate was increased to 0.4 mL/min, and a 40-minute linear
gradient was run from 20% solvent B to 100% solvent B. Peak areas of lysophosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylcholines, phospha-
tidylethanolamines, sphingomyelins, and ceramides were quantified by integration of [M+H]+ peaks in Agilent MassHunter software.
Peak areas of fatty acids, diglycerides, and triglycerides were quantified by integration of [M+NH4]+ peaks, and monoglycerides were
quantified by integration of [M+Na]+ peaks in Agilent MassHunter software. Peak areas of phosphatidic acids, phosphatidylserines,
phosphatidylglycerols, and phosphatidylinositols were quantified by integration of [M–H]– peaks in Agilent MassHunter software.
Analysis of choline and phosphocholine:
Diluted pellets from the lipid analysis above were split into 3 aliquots of 75 mL each and their order was randomized. To each 75 mL
aliquot in a 1.75 mL centrifuge tube was added 1.0 mL of ice-cold 80% methanol in water. These mixtures were kept on dry ice for
5 minutes, then vortexed one minute, kept on dry ice for 10 minutes, and vortexed again for one minute. The tubes were centrifuged at
4�C for 5 minutes at 18’000 g. The supernatant was collected, and the pellets were re-extracted with 1.0 mL of dry-ice-cooled 80%
methanol in water. After pelleting again, the supernatants were combined and concentrated in vacuo. The residue was re-dissolved in
90% acetonitrile in water for LC-MS analysis (10 mL injections). High-resolution LC-MS was performed in positive mode using a Phe-
nomenex Kinetex HILIC column. Solvent A was acetonitrile; solvent B was 5 mM ammonium formate in water. After injection, solvent
A was pumped at 0.1 mL/min for five minutes, after which the flow rate was increased to 0.4 mL/min, and a 40-minute linear gradient
was run from 20% solvent B to 100% solvent B. Peak areas of choline and phosphocholine were quantified by integration of [M+H]+
peaks in Agilent MassHunter software.
Quantification of sexual differentiation
Sexual differentiation was induced in tightly synchronized P. falciparum parasites (28±2 hpi) by incubating the cells for 22 hours in CM
(220 mL per well of a 96-well plate; 0.3-0.5% parasitemia; 2.5% hematocrit) or in �SerM as described (Brancucci et al., 2015). If not
stated otherwise, cell line Pf2004/164tdTom was used for all experiments. To determine the effect of culture perturbations on sexual
commitment, serum fractions as well as nutrients or inhibitor compounds (solved in either RPMI, DMSO, chloroform, ethanol or meth-
anol) were added to the bottom of empty wells (glass bottom dishes were used for chloroform-containing samples) and directly re-
suspended in parasite culture after allowing volatile solvents to evaporate. To determine sexual differentiation in reticulocyte-en-
riched blood, tightly synchronized parasites were magnet purified at 46±2 hpi using MACS CS columns in a SuperMACS (Miltenyi
Biotec) before incubating pure schizont-infected erythrocytes (>99%) with the blood sample to be tested. These culture perturba-
tions were then tested for effects on parasite sexual differentiation as described (Brancucci et al., 2015). In brief, following the
22 hour testing phase (see above), cells of each well were washed 3 times in 200 mL +SerM medium before being resuspended in
220 mL +SerM medium. Henceforth, medium was exchanged daily. Parasitemia and gametocytemia was quantified using flow cy-
tometry at 20-30 hpi (MACS Quant, Analyzer 10) and 72-96 hpi (BD Fortessa), respectively. Cytometry data were analysed using
FlowJo software and sexual differentiation rates were determined by dividing gametocytemia of each well with the corresponding
parasitemia measurements. Assays were run in biological triplicates. Each biological replicate contained technical triplicates.
P. berghei sexual commitment assays were performed using a parasite line expressing an RFP reporter under the gametocyte-
specific gene PBANKA_1018700 (Sinha et al., 2014) and GFP under the constitutive PBANKA_0905600 promoter, in the 507cl1
background line (RMgm-7). Mature schizonts were intravenously (IV) administered to naı
¨ve TO mice. Ring stage parasites were iso-
lated at 4 hpi and mature trophozoites and gametocytes were removed by passing through a MACS LD column (Miltenyi Biotec).
Infected erythrocytes were incubated in �SerM medium, �SerM medium supplemented with 20 mM LysoPC (�SerM/LysoPC), or
serum-complemented medium (+SerM) for 20 hours. Mature schizont stage parasites were then isolated on a 55% Nycodenz
(Axis-Shield POC)/RPMI gradient and injected intravenously into 2 or 3 naı
¨ve mice. GFP-expressing cells were examined by flow
cytometry at 16 hpi to calculate parasitemia, while cells expressing both RFP and GFP (gametocytes) were assessed at 21 hpi.
Gametocytemia was calculated as [(RFP+ and GFP+ cells)/GFP+ cells]*100.
Reticulocyte isolation
Reticulocytes were isolated as described (Clark et al., 2014; Sorette et al., 1992). Briefly, cells were enriched from leukocyte-depleted
blood in a two-step process. First, 500 mL of leukodepleted blood was aliquoted into 50 mL conicals and erythrocytes were spun for
1 hour at 4000 g. Plasma was removed and the top 20% of packed cells was carefully collected. Cells from this first enrichment step
were then resuspended at a hematocrit of 50% in plasma and subsequently layered at a 1:1 ratio onto a 1.080 g/mL KCl high Percoll
(Sigma-Aldrich) density gradient and spun for 25 minutes at 1200 g. The reticulocyte-enriched interphase was collected and washed
Cell 171, 1532–1544.e1–e10, December 14, 2017
e7
 twice with 10x volume of RPMI to remove residual Percoll. Enriched reticulocytes were subsequently stored at a minimum hematocrit
of 10% in RPMI medium containing 0.5% Albumax, 25 mM HEPES, and 24 mM sodium bicarbonate. High purity isolation of CD71-
positive reticulocytes was performed according to standard MACS procedures for microbead isolation of CD71+ cells, as suggested
by the manufacturer (Miltenyi Biotec).
Transcriptional profiling
P. falciparum NF54 and Pf2004/164tdTom parasite cultures were synchronized to a 4-hour time window using consecutive sorbitol
(Sigma-Aldrich) treatments and exposed to conditions that induce (�SerM) or prevent sexual commitment (�SerM/LysoPC (20 mM
LysoPC); +SerM) at 30±2 hpi. Total RNA was collected in 1 mL Trizol (Invitrogen) from approximately 5x108 parasites per condition at
this time point and in 4-hour intervals thereafter and stored at -80�C. Prior to Trizol treatment, erythrocytes were lysed in 0.015%
saponin (room temperature, 5 min, from Sigma-Aldrich) and parasites were pelleted (3000 g, 5 min) and washed three times in
10 mL PBS at room temperature. RNA was isolated from 500 mL Trizol solution by three extraction steps (1x using 500 mL phenol:
chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1); 2x using 100 mL chloroform). After vigorous shaking for 30 seconds, phases were separated
by centrifugation (12000 g, 10 min, 4�C). RNA was purified from 200 mL of the aqueous phase using an RNeasy micro kit (Qiagen)
and corresponding protocol. RNA was eluted in 32 mL DEPC-treated water, quantified by Qubit (Life Technologies) and stored
at -80�C.
0.5 mg - 1.0 mg total RNA of each sample was used for library preparation. Libraries were prepared by using TruSeq Stranded mRNA
kit (Illumina). Library quantification was conducted by qPCR and TapeStation (Agilent Technologies) measurements. Libraries were
subsequently pooled and sequenced using 300 cycle V2 MiSeq reagent kit (Illumina).
Imaging of LysoPC in live cells
Prior to imaging, P. falciparum early trophozoite-infected RBCs were incubated in either �SerM (inducing), �SerM conditions sup-
plemented with 20 mM LysoPC (�SerM/LysoPC; non-inducing), or serum-complemented medium (+SerM; non-inducing). Parasites
were allowed to develop until the trophozoite stage (26±2 hpi), late trophozoite stage (30±2 hpi), early schizont (36±2 hpi), late
schizont (42±2 hpi), or ring stage (4±2 hpi).
Parasites were processed as described by Gru
¨ ring et al. (Gru
¨ ring et al., 2011). Briefly, cells from �SerM, �SerM/LysoPC, or +SerM
culture were arrested on the glass bottom of a sterile, concanavalin A (ConA, Sigma-Aldrich)-coated dish. ConA was dissolved at a
concentration of 0.5 mg per mL in H2O, and 200 mL were distributed uniformly on the glass surface of a 27 mm dish (Scientific Lab-
oratory Supplies). ConA was added to the dish for 30 minutes at 37�C. It was then washed off twice, using 1x PBS, after which the
culture was re-suspended in PBS, added to the glass bottom of the dish, and allowed to settle for 20 minutes at 37�C. Thereafter,
non-bound cells were washed off using PBS, leaving a monolayer in the glass bottom, and 2 mL of pre-warmed PBS were added to
the dish for imaging. Cells were viewed using a Zeiss Observer Z1 spinning disc confocal microscope equipped with an incubation
chamber, a Yokogawa CSU-X1 filter wheel and spinning disc unit, a Photometrics Evolve 512 delta EM-CCD camera and four laser
lines: 405, 488, 561, and 642 nm, and an a-Plan-Apochromat 100x 1.46 NA DIC VIS immersion oil lens.
Immediately prior to imaging, cells were incubated in either 20 mM TopFluor LysoPC (1-(dipyrrometheneboron difluoride)
undecanoyl-2-hydroxy-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine); in 20 mM TopFluor phosphatidylcholine (PC) (1-palmitoyl-2-[11-(dipyrrome-
theneboron difluoride) undecanoyl]-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine); or in 20 mM NBD phosphatidic acid (PA) (1-palmitoyl-2-{12-
[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl] amino} dodecanoyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (ammonium salt)) (all from Avanti Polar Lipids).
Lipids were dissolved in methanol and stored as stocks at a concentration of 1 mM. For use, the lipid solution was added to a
dish and the methanol was allowed to evaporate under sterile conditions. The lipids were then re-suspended in PBS to a concentra-
tion of 20 mM prior to addition to the iRBCs. For ER colocalization and nuclear staining, ER tracker red (Bodipy TR glibenclamide, from
Invitrogen) and Hoechst 33342 (ThermoScientific) were used, respectively. Cells were viewed using 40 nm (Hoechst), 488 nm
(TopFluor) or 561 nm (ER-tracker and dsRed) laser lines.
Image collection parameters for localization at different stages were 512 x 512 d.p.i, 50-72 z-stacks (0.2 mm step size), a zoom level
of 1-2 and laser levels of 1-5% for 488 nm, 1-10% for 561 nm, and 10% for 405 nm. Image collection parameters for time-lapse im-
aging of LysoPC uptake and co-localization with ER-tracker were 512 x 512 d.p.i, at an interval of 1 s per frame. Image acquisition
was initiated (time zero) prior to the addition of the labeled dye. Without interruption of image acquisition, 20 s after acquisition of the
first image, the dissolved labeled dye was added to the culture dish, and image acquisition continued to visualize uptake of the dye
and distribution within the infected erythrocyte.
To avoid crosstalk between channels images were collected in line sequential mode with z-increments of 0.19 mm. Images were
acquired using the Zen 2012 (Zeiss) software. Images were analyzed with Fiji (Schindelin et al., 2012) and Imaris (Bitplane) software.
100 images were quantified and analyzed per condition and time point.
Quantification of merozoite numbers
P. falciparum trophozoite-infected erythrocytes were incubated in either �SerM medium (inducing), �SerM medium supplemented
with 20 mM LysoPC (�SerM/LysoPC; non-inducing), or serum-complemented media (+SerM; non-inducing). Following a 4-6 hour
incubation period, parasites were incubated in +SerM, and allowed to develop until 32±2 hpi. Parasites were then immobilized in
e8

 a glass-bottom dish as described above, stained with Hoechst 33342, and 50-72 z-stacks (0.2 mm step size) obtained using bright
field and the 405 nm laser line, to determine the number of nuclei in every infected erythrocyte. This procedure was repeated bi-hourly
for a total of 18 hours per condition, and 50-100 images quantified per time point and condition.
Synchronized and newly invaded P. berghei ring stage parasites were isolated as described earlier. Infected erythrocytes were
incubated in �SerM conditions, �SerM supplemented with 20 mM LysoPC (�SerM/LysoPC), or serum-complemented medium
(+SerM). At the indicated time points, infected erythrocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/0.075% glutaraldehyde in PBS
for 10 minutes, washed twice in PBS, smeared on glass slides and mounted in Vectashield containing DAPI (Vectorlabs). Z-stacks
of 4-5 mm (0.1 mm step) were acquired on a DeltaVision epifluorescence microscope (Applied Precision) using the 405 nm and bright
field filter sets. Images were deconvoluted using SoftWoRx to count number of merozoites.
Calculation of LysoPC levels from published data
We compared our P. berghei-infected mouse LysoPC quantification with published levels of LysoPC in parasite- and bacteria-in-
fected humans. In the case of bacterial sepsis (Drobnik et al., 2003) and P. aeruginosa-infected cystic fibrosis patients (Ollero
et al., 2011), LysoPC concentrations from infected and uninfected hosts were explicitly reported. In these cases, the reported values
were directly plotted in Figure 6A. In the case of P. falciparum infection (Lakshmanan et al., 2012; Orikiiriza et al., 2017) and T. brucei
infection (Lamour et al., 2015), only relative quantities of LysoPC in infected versus uninfected hosts were reported. To calculate ab-
solute LysoPC concentrations from these data, we set the uninfected LysoPC concentrations to the levels published for healthy in-
dividuals (Psychogios et al., 2011), and calculated LysoPC concentrations of the infected individuals based on the reported relative
quantification data. The uninfected data and calculated infected data were plotted in Figure 6A.
Generation of CRISPR/Cas9 and donor plasmids
Using the previously published transfection vectors pUF1_Cas9 and pL-6_eGFP (Ghorbal et al., 2014) as templates, we generated a
new CRISPR/Cas9 plasmid termed p_gC that contains expression cassettes for the Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme and the
single guide RNA (sgRNA). In addition, we inserted into p_gC a HindIII-SalI-EcoRI-BamHI multi-cloning site for insertion of a drug
resistance cassette and replaced the original BtgZI recognition site in the U6 sgRNA expression cassette with a BsaI site for direc-
tional insertion of the sgRNA target sequence. We then inserted a hdhfr resistance cassette into BamHI-digested p_gC to obtain the
Cas9/sgRNA mother plasmid pH_gC. To engineer marker-free parasites expressing AP2-G-GFP from the endogenous locus
(PF3D7_1222600) we generated transfection vectors pH_gC-ap2g-3’ (Cas9/sgRNA suicide plasmid) and pD_ap2g-gfp (donor
plasmid) (Supplementary Figure S4). To generate pH_gC-ap2g-3’, two complementary oligonucleotides (sgt_ap2g3’_F, sgt_
ap2g3’_R) encoding the sgRNA target sequence sgt_ap2-g-3’ and appropriate single-stranded overhangs were annealed and in-
serted into the sgRNA expression cassette using BsaI-digested pH_gC and T4 DNA ligase. The sgRNA target sequence sgt_ap2g3’
(AGTTATAGGGAATATTCAAA) is positioned 60bp downstream of the ap2-g coding sequence and was identified using CHOPCHOP
(Labun et al., 2016). The donor plasmid pD_ap2g-gfp was generated using Gibson assembly joining four PCR fragments encoding (1)
the plasmid backbone amplified from pUC19 using primers PCRA_F and PCRA_R, (2) the ap2-g 5’ homology box amplified from 3D7
gDNA using primers PCRB_F and PCRB_R, (3) the gfp coding sequence (plus N-terminal GSAG linker) amplified from pH-GFP (Bran-
cucci et al., 2014) using primers PCRC_F and PCRC_R, and (4) the ap2-g 3’ homology box amplified from 3D7 gDNA using primers
PCRD_F and PCRD_R. All oligonucleotide sequences are provided in Supplementary Table S1.
Parasite transfection and selection
NF54 ring stage parasites were transfected simultaneously with 50 mg pH_gC-ap2g-3’ (Cas9/sgRNA suicide plasmid) and 50 mg
pD_ap2g-gfp (donor plasmid) using electroporation conditions as described (Voss et al., 2006). To select for parasites carrying
the tagged ap2-g locus (NF54/AP2-GGFP), transfected parasites were grown in presence of 4 nM WR99210 for the first six days
and then in absence of drug pressure until a stably propagating parasite population was established (approximately four weeks
post-transfection). Successful tagging of the ap2-g locus in the NF54/AP2-GGFP population was confirmed by PCR on gDNA (Fig-
ure S4). All oligonucleotide sequences are provided in Table S1.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Except for RNA-seq data analysis (see below), statistical details can be found in the figure and figure legends.
RNA-seq experiments and data analysis
RNA-seq reads from each sample were aligned to the P. falciparum reference genome (PlasmoDB version 28). A maximum of one
mismatch per read was allowed. The mapped reads from TopHat (Kim et al., 2013) were used to assemble known transcripts from the
reference and their abundances were estimated using Cufflinks (Trapnell et al., 2010). The expression level of each gene was normal-
ized as FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads). We developed an induction score (IS) to measure transcrip-
tional responses of genes to different culture conditions. For two strains (S e NF54, Pf2004) in different conditions (C e +SerM, �SerM
and �SerM/LysoPC), the transcription level (Exp) of each gene i in 4 time points (T e TP1, TP2, TP3 and TP4) can be represented as

Wilcoxon test and BH p value adjustment were implemented. Genes with an adjusted p value of less than 0.05 were identified as
significantly differentially regulated. Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were obtained from PlasmoDB version 28. The Barnard test
(Barnard, 1947) was used to test enrichment of specific GO terms in each gene group against the genomic background.

(A) Schematic maps of the endogenous ap2-g locus (PF3D7_1222600) in wild-type parasites (top), the pH_gC-ap2g-3’ and pD_ap2g-gfp transfection vectors
(center), and the edited ap2-g-gfp locus after CRISPR/Cas9-based marker-free fusion of the gfp sequence to the 3’end of the ap2-g coding sequence in NF54/
AP2-GGFP parasites (bottom). Numbers refer to nucleotide positions on chromosome 12 (http://plasmodb.org/). The position of the sgt_ap2g3’ sgRNA target
sequence 60bp downstream of the ap2-g coding sequence is indicated. The pH_gC-ap2g-3’ Cas9/sgRNA suicide plasmid contains expression cassettes for
SpCas9, the sgRNA and the hdhfr resistance marker. In the pD_ap2g-gfp donor plasmid two homology regions (5’HR and 3’HR) flanking the gfp coding sequence
facilitate repair of the Cas9-induced double-strand break and marker-free tagging of the ap2-g gene by double crossover homologous recombination. Yellow
asterisks indicate the position of translation termination codons. Positions of PCR primer binding sites used to confirm successful gene editing are indicated by
horizontal black arrows.
(B) PCR on gDNA isolated from NF54/AP2-GGFP and 3D7 wild-type control parasites. Primers apF and apR bind to wild-type sequences outside the ap2-g 5’HR
and ap2-g 3’HR homology regions and amplify a 2218bp or 1502bp fragment from the edited ap2-g-gfp or wild-type ap2-g locus, respectively. The ap2F/gfpR
and gfpF/ap2R primer combinations are specific for the edited ap2-g-gfp locus in NF54/AP2-GGFP parasites and amplify 1170 and 1222bp fragments,
respectively.
