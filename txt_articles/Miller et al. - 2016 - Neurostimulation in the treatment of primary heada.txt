ABSTRACT
There is increasing interest in using
neurostimulation to treat headache disorders.
There are now several non-invasive and invasive
stimulation devices available with some open-
label series and small controlled trial studies that
support their use. Non-invasive stimulation
options include supraorbital stimulation (Cefaly),
vagus nerve stimulation (gammaCore) and
single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation
(SpringTMS). Invasive procedures include
occipital nerve stimulation, sphenopalatine
ganglion stimulation and ventral tegmental area
deep brain stimulation. These stimulation devices
may find a place in the treatment pathway of
headache disorders. Here, we explore the basic
principles of neurostimulation for headache and
overview the available methods of
neurostimulation.
BACKGROUND
Headache conditions can be classified
into episodic and chronic forms (box 1).
Chronic
headache
is
a
major
global
health issue affecting up to 4% of the
population.1 Most patients with chronic
headache
attending
neurology
centres
have chronic migraine or cluster head-
ache.
The
estimated
prevalence
of
chronic migraine is 2% and of chronic
cluster is 0.02%.2 Although most patients
are helped with medical treatments, a sig-
nificant minority cannot tolerate or prove
refractory to pharmacological treatments.
Neurostimulation therapies with periph-
eral or central targets may help these
patients. Here, we provide an overview
of
this
emerging
field
of
headache
management.
NEUROSTIMULATION FOR PAIN
Electrical stimulation to treat pain is not
a new concept. Scribonius Largus, ca. CE
46, advocated fish ‘electrotherapy’ to
treat headache.3 Modern neurostimula-
tion for pain has its roots in functional
neurosurgery, which initially relied on
destructive lesions before focusing on
neurostimulation to manage intractable
pain.
Neurostimulation
works
by
manipulating central or peripheral pain
pathways using
electrical
or magnetic
impulses. It aims is modify the pain
system in such a way to reduce pain
levels.
There are multiple targets for neurosti-
mulation in headache, including the pos-
terior
hypothalamus/ventral
tegmental
area,
sphenopalatine
ganglion
(SPG),
occipital nerve, vagus nerve, supraorbital
nerve
and
cortex.
These
have
been
selected because of the recent recognition
of
anatomically
relevant
pathophysio-
logical
pathways
and
hypothesised
mechanisms in both animal and human
models of migraine and cluster headache.
Applying electrical or magnetic stimula-
tion to pain pathways can modify central
neurotransmitters.4 For preventive treat-
ment, these changes aim to cause a wind
down of the central sensitisation that
occurs in chronic headache. For acute
treatment, these changes probably block
the processes responsible for attack gen-
eration (cortical spreading depression or
brainstem
activation).
Figure
1
sum-
marises the pathways most likely involved
in the mechanism of action of these neu-
rostimulation treatments.
Currently
available
non-invasive
devices target the supraorbital and vagus
nerves
(electrical
stimulation)
or
the
cortex (magnetic stimulation). Available
invasive stimulation techniques involve
the occipital nerves and SPG (peripheral
targets) and the ventral tegmental area
(central
target).
Such
techniques
may
help those patients who wish to avoid,
are refractory to or intolerant of previous
drug therapies. Devices that allow acute
treatment of attacks may be help those
who cannot use triptans or in whom
acute medications are ineffective or over-
used.

tive and acute headache treatments—may,

NON-INVASIVE NEUROSTIMULATION DEVICES
Supraorbital nerve stimulation and the Cefaly device
The trigeminovascular system has a crucial role in
head pain.5 The supraorbital nerve is a branch of the
first division of the trigeminal nerve. Transcutaneous
supraorbital nerve stimulation has been developed as a
potential treatment for headache. The Cefaly device is
an external transcutaneous supraorbital nerve stimula-
tor that is battery powered and applied to the fore-
head
using
a
headband-like
device
(figure
2).
Currently, the device is not available on the National

Possible role for the Cefaly device
Acute treatment of episodic migraine
There is no well-controlled evidence for using the
Cefaly device in the acute treatment of episodic
migraine. A single pilot study of 10 patients using the
device for acute migraine treatment showed no effect
on 57% of treated attacks and was associated with
pain freedom in only 13% of attacks.6
Preventative treatment of episodic migraine
Evidence for the use of the Cefaly device in prevent-
ing
episodic
migraine
comes
from
one
small,
manufacturer-sponsored
sham-controlled
trial,
the
PREvention of MIgraine using the STS Cefaly (the
PREMICE study) and company postmarketing survey
data. The sham-controlled study involved only 67 sub-
jects with episodic migraine, who after a one month
run-in period of normal treatment used the Cefaly or
sham device for 3 months and reported a significant
reduction in migraine days by 29.7% from 6.94 to
4.88 days (p=0.023) in the active group compared to
a non-significant change of 4.9% from 6.54 to 6.22
days (p=0.608) in the sham group.7 For comparison,
topiramate 100 mg daily decreased migraine days by
44% in a pooled analysis of controlled studies.8 The
therapeutic gain for the 50% responder rate of supra-
orbital nerve stimulation was 26.1% compared with
23.5% for topiramate but the therapeutic gain in
migraine day reduction is much higher in pooled
studies of topiramate at 24.5% compared with the
PREMICE trial at 12%.8 The responder rate shown in
the PREMICE study was within the range quoted for
other migraine preventatives such as propranolol and
antiepileptic
medications.9
10
The
postmarketing
survey of 2313 subjects using the device to prevent
episodic migraine reported 53% of users were ‘satis-
fied’ with the treatment, as determined by the number
continuing treatment after a 40-day trial period.11 In
the PREMICE trial, 70.6% declared themselves satis-
fied after 3 months of treatment.7 In contrast, using
stopping of treatment as a measure of patient satisfac-
tion,
one
American
health
insurance
survey
of
migraine preventatives found that 26.6% of patients
on antidepressants, 29.8% on antiepileptic medica-
tions and 32.4% on beta-blockers were satisfied and
remained on treatment after 6 months.
Using the Cefaly device
Box 2 outlines a preventative regimen involving preset
stimulation sessions to be used daily. As with all
migraine preventatives, treatment must continue for
3 months before assessing efficacy, so encouraging
treatment adherence is important. The manufacturers
have a preprogrammed 20 min session ‘acute setting’
for terminating a migraine attack, despite there being
no evidence to support its use in acute migraine.
The adverse effects of the Cefaly device appear
mild
and
transient.11
Some
patients
experience
intolerance to paraesthesia, drowsiness, worsening of
headache and reversible forehead irritation. Table 2
lists its contraindications.

 Proposed mechanism of action
W
e do not yet know the mode of action of supraorbital
nerve stimulation in migraine. In healthy volunteers,
stimulation with supraorbital nerve stimulation has an
acute sedative effect.12 Although it is questionable
whether this influences the preventive treatment of
migraine, it does suggest that supraorbital nerve stimu-
lation can change brain activity. Current understanding
of migraine pathophysiology suggests that there is neur-
onal hyperexcitability of the pain neuromatrix: trigemi-
novascular activation appears to be the basis for the
headache phase and central sensitisation the mechan-
ism that may contribute to the transformation from epi-
sodic to chronic forms. Supraorbital nerve stimulation
probably winds down the trigeminal pain pathways
through altering activity within the trigeminovascular
system both peripherally and centrally.
Vagus nerve simulation and the gammaCore device
The vagus nerve is a mixed motor and sensory nerve
that is important in controlling autonomic responses;
it projects to several higher centres that are important
in pain regulation. Following reports of migraine
improvement in patients receiving vagus nerve stimu-
lation for epilepsy, the nerve became a target for head-
ache treatment. The gammaCore device is a handheld
transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulator applied to the
neck (figure 3). Devices are available charged with
either 150 or 300 treatment cycles, after which a new
device must be purchased. If used for prevention only,
the 300-treatment device lasts around 50 days; thus, a
patient needs two devices to have the efficacy assessed
at 3 months. Currently, the device is not available on
the NHS but individual funding requests may be con-
sidered. If purchased direct from the manufacturer,
the 300-treatment device costs around £550.
Evidence for the gammaCore device
Preventative treatment of cluster headache
The current evidence for its use in preventing cluster
headache attacks is limited to a manufacturer-sponsored
trial involving 97 subjects. This trial of standard of care
plus vagus nerve stimulation versus standard of care
alone was conducted on the preventative and acute
treatment
of
chronic
cluster
headache
using
the
gammaCore device. Regular use of gammaCore for
4 weeks was associated with a significantly reduced
attack frequency in the active compared with standard
of care group (7 vs 2 fewer attacks per week).13
Similarly
, more subjects in the active group reported
>50% fewer weekly attacks compared with those on
standard treatment (52% vs 9%).14 For comparison, the
responder rate for verapamil 360 mg daily was 80%
versus 0% for placebo in the only available small
randomised-controlled trial.14
Acute treatment of cluster headache
The above randomised study found no effect of acute
gammaCore
treatment
on
headache
intensity.13
However, in a small open-label study of 19 patients
using the device for acute treatment, 47% of attacks
ended
within
11 min
(average
duration
before
gammaCore use was 75 min).15 All 13 patients using
triptans before starting using gammaCore treatment
could reduce their intake, and four patients stopped
triptans completely. The standard acute treatments for
cluster headache attacks are subcutaneous sumatriptan
and high-flow oxygen. In one randomised double-
blind study of 39 patients, subcutaneous sumatriptan
aborted 74% of attacks within 15 min compared with
26% of those treated with placebo.16 In another ran-
domised control study of 76 patients, high-flow
oxygen
aborted
78%
of
attacks
within
15 min,
whereas placebo aborted only 20% of attacks.17
Preventative treatment of chronic migraine
There are no data to support the use of gammaCore
to prevent chronic migraine. A single controlled trial
of 59 patients comparing active gammaCore to sham
treatment showed that, after 2 months, active treat-
ment was not associated with a reduction of headache
days
(−1.9 days
with
gammaCore
vs
0.20
sham
(p=0.124)).18 Although open-label extension data
suggest that a longer duration of treatment might be
effective, we need more controlled studies to investi-
gate this.
Acute treatment of migraine
There have been no controlled studies in acute
migraine. T
wo small open-label studies examined
gammaCore in treating acute migraine pain. The first,
involving 27 patients treating 80 attacks, used two
stimulation cycles administered 15 min apart during
an
attack.19

from baseline at 2 h following treatment, with a 50%
reduction in 46% at 2 h, increasing to 61% at 4 h

Possible role of the gammaCore device
Current evidence suggests that the gammaCore device
should only be considered to prevent cluster head-
ache. There is no robust evidence for using it as an
acute treatment (table 1). Nonetheless, it might be
considered as an acute treatment for patients with
more than two cluster attacks daily (ie, more attacks
than can safely be treated with subcutaneous suma-
triptan), in those with contraindications to triptans
and in those where all acute medications for cluster
headache are ineffective. There is no evidence as yet
for using gammaCore in migraine.
Using the gammaCore device
Box 3 outlines our recommended regimens for using
gammaCore. The activated device delivers a single
programme cycle of 2 min. For preventative treatment
of cluster headache, we recommend daily use of
gammaCore for 3 months before assessing efficacy. If
the patient wishes to use it for acute treatment of
cluster headache, we recommend that they use it for
two programme cycles at attack onset. The reported
adverse effects are mild and include transient hoarse-
ness, voice change, skin irritation, muscle ache and
uncomfortable
paraesthesia.

Proposed mechanism of action
The vagus nerve has several connections to higher
brain centres that are important in pain regulation,
such as the nucleus tractus solitarius and spinal
Box 3
Using the
gammaCore device to treat
cluster headache
The patient locates their carotid pulse in the neck and
places the device over this.
The device can be used on either side of the neck.
The stimulation is adjusted by turning a thumbwheel
until a deep vibration is felt inside the neck. The patient
should aim to use the maximum tolerable intensity
(stimulation setting three or more in most people).
When correctly positioned, the subject should feel a
pulling at the corner of the mouth. This is a normal
response and patients should be encouraged to look out
for it.
For acute treatment of cluster headache attacks (evidence
base poor):
Deliver two programme cycles (a total of 4 min) at the
attack onset. Repeat after 15 min if needed.
For preventative treatment of cluster headache attacks:
Deliver one programme cycle (total of 2 min) three times
a day.
The regimen can be increased to two cycles (total of
4 min) three times daily if required.
Preventative sessions should be delivered daily for
3 months before assessing efficacy.

 trigeminal nucleus. Early studies suggested that the
acute effect of vagus nerve stimulation is mediated by
direct inhibition of afferents to the caudal trigeminal
nucleus.22 More recently, neuroimaging studies have
shown that chronic vagus nerve stimulation inhibits
activation of the thalamus, limbic system, dorsal pons,
locus coeruleus and nucleus tractus solitarius, all of
which are structures identified in imaging studies as
part of the pain matrix of headache.23 There is also
evidence that it may inhibit pain by reducing the con-
centration of glutamate in the trigeminal nucleus cau-
dalis; this in turn may reverse central sensitisation in
chronic headache.24
Transcranial magnetic stimulation and the SpringTMS
device
Transcranial magnetic stimulation applies a brief single
magnetic pulse to the scalp and underlying cortex.
This pulse induces electrical fields in the cortex, alter-
ing neurotransmitter release and disrupting cortical
spreading depression. The SpringTMS device is a
rechargeable handheld device that delivers a single
pulse of magnetic stimulation to the back of the head.
As with other non-invasive devices, it is not widely
available through NHS sources but individual funding
requests can be made (with special arrangements for
clinical governance, audit and outcome data collec-
tion, as per National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence recommendations).25 In the private sector,
it is available from the manufacturer for a free
3-month trial after which the patient must pay £158
every month for continuing use.
Evidence for SpringTMS
Acute treatment of migraine with and without aura
The evidence for acute treatment of migraine comes
from only one small manufacturer-sponsored study
and postmarketing surveys. A sham-controlled study
on SpringTMS in the acute treatment of migraine
with
aura
in
164
patients
reported
a
pain-free
response rate higher in those with active compared
with sham treatment at both 2 h (39% vs 22%) and
24 h (29% vs 16%) for a therapeutic gain of 17%
(p=0.0179).26 As above, in a previous trial of acute
migraine treatment, the pain-free rate was 67% for
100 mg sumatriptan with a placebo rate of 28%.20
In an open-label postmarketing survey of 462 sub-
jects in the UK using SpringTMS as acute treatment
for migraine with and without aura, authors obtained
3-month follow-up data on only 190 patients.27 The
discontinuation rate within the 3-month follow-up
period was 55% (n=105) mainly due to inadequate
benefit
(n=49),
cost
(n=−17)
or
inconvenience
(n=15). Of the 190 subjects who completed 3 months
follow-up, 62% reported some reduction in migraine
pain and 59% some reduction in attack duration. The
group did
not
provide
further clarification
with
responder rates and so we cannot make meaningful
comparisons to other acute treatments for migraine.
Preventative treatment of migraine
There is no controlled evidence to support the use of
SpringTMS in the prevention of migraine.
Possible uses of SpringTMS
From
the
limited
evidence
available,
SpringTMS
might have a role in the acute treatment of migraine
with and without aura in those at risk of overusing
acute medications or if acute pharmacological treat-
ments are ineffective (table 1). As with the other
devices, there are no clear safety data in children or in
pregnancy; however, three women among the post-
marketing
data
completed
normal
pregnancies.27

evidence

the
use
of
SpringTMS in the preventative treatment of migraine

Proposed mechanism of action
Patients with migraine are thought to have a state of
brain hyperexcitability, and this has been shown in
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
studies.28
This
hyperexcitable cortex leads to a lowered threshold for
cortical spreading depression, a wave of depolarisation
of neural membranes, which has been linked to the
generation of migraine aura and activation of menin-
geal nociceptors directly or via descending facilitation
pathways.29 In animal studies, single-pulse transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
inhibits
cortical
spreading
depression. Thus, in acute migraine, single-pulse tran-
scranial magnetic stimulation has the potential to ter-
minate aura and reduce the severity of headache in
those with
aura.
Repetitive
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation
reduces
cortical
hyperexcitability
by
modulating concentrations of neurotransmitters such
as dopamine and glutamate in the caudate and hippo-
campus.28
Thus,
repetitive
transcranial
magnetic
stimulation may produce long-term changes in neur-
onal excitability, reversing central sensitisation and
reducing headache frequency. However, much of the
work with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation
has been based on laboratory studies and it has not
yet translated into a useful clinical treatment effect.
INVASIVE NEUROSTIMULATION DEVICES
Occipital nerve stimulation
The occipital nerves are a target for stimulation due
to the anatomical overlap between the trigeminal and
cervical afferents in the trigeminocervical complex.
This allows stimulation of the occipital region to
modulate pain in the trigeminal distribution. Occipital
nerve stimulation is a non-destructive surgical proced-
ure where electrodes are placed subcutaneously in the
occipital region and then wired to a battery pack in
the chest or abdomen (figure 5). Stimulation para-
meters
can
be
adjusted
to
control
paraesthesia.
Patients can adjust their device and recharge the
battery using a handheld remote control. Occipital
nerve stimulation is not widely available and should
only be performed in highly specialised services with
established surgical and headache teams.
Evidence for occipital nerve stimulation
Open-label studies have shown possible efficacy in
preventing chronic migraine, chronic cluster headache,
hemicrania continua and short-lasting unilateral neur-
algiform headache attacks.30 The average response
rate is around 70% for chronic cluster headache and
56% for chronic migraine.

A
positive
response (a 50% reduction in monthly headache days
or a >3-point reduction in pain scores) was seen in
39% of the adjustable group, 6% in the preset group
and 0% in the medical group. Another randomised
study of 125 subjects comparing active with sham
stimulation
showed
no
significant
difference
in
migraine day reduction between the groups after 3
months.32 The third randomised trial of occipital nerve
stimulation
for
chronic
migraine
looked
at
157
patients. The proportion of subjects achieving a >50%
reduction in daily pain scores was not significantly dif-
ferent in the active and sham groups (17% vs 14%).
However, the reduction of headache days was signifi-
cantly higher in the active group (27% vs 15%) as was
the proportion of patients achieving at least a 30%
reduction in pain scores (38% vs 19%). Pain specialists
now widely accept that a 30% improvement in chronic
pain represents a clinically meaningful improvement;
thus, this study outcome favoured the use of occipital
nerve stimulation.33 A 2015 systemic review and
meta-analysis of the effectiveness of occipital nerve
stimulation found that in a pooled analysis of the three
above controlled trials, occipital nerve stimulation was
associated with a mean reduction of 2.59 migraine days
per month after 3 months compared with sham con-
trols.34 However, analysis on other outcome measures
was hampered by incomplete publications and poor
reporting of data. Open-label follow-up data gave
limited evidence of long-term efficacy.
Preventative treatment of chronic cluster headache
There are no controlled trials of occipital nerve stimu-
lation in chronic cluster headache. However, positive
open-label studies support its use (table 3). One
recent review paper conducted a pooled analysis of
the nine published studies involving 91 patients and
found that patients reported an average 67% reduc-
tion of attack frequency.30
Possible uses of occipital nerve stimulation
Occipital nerve stimulation, as with all invasive neuro-
stimulation devices, must be reserved for those with
highly medically refractory headaches who have not
responded to all other treatments (table 1). The
European Headache Society has guidelines on the use
of invasive neurostimulation and patient selection (see
online supplementary data table).41
Occipital nerve stimulation can be considered for
preventative treatment of refractory chronic migraine
or cluster headaches. Patients must be assessed by a
specialist team before consideration of surgery and
must be deemed significantly disabled by their head-
aches. Following the implant, patients cannot have
MRI scans and so occipital nerve stimulation should
be avoided in those with coexisting conditions that
may require future MRI scanning (ie, multiple scler-
osis). Occipital nerve stimulation has no role in the
acute treatment
of migraine or cluster headache
attacks.
Using occipital nerve stimulation
Bilateral leads should be implanted even with unilat-
eral headaches as pain often swaps sides with unilat-
eral stimulation. Following implantation, the device is
programmed to give a comfortable level of paraesthe-
sia in the distribution of the greater occipital nerve.
The device is left on at all times, and generally
patients are advised not to alter the settings unless the

Stimulation is not to be altered during acute attacks.
Current rechargeable batteries should last around 5–
7 years, and patients are advised to charge them at
least once weekly to prevent system failure. It can take
up to 3 months post-programming to detect any
change in headache severity or frequency. It is import-
ant that patients are followed up frequently in the
early postoperative period to ensure optimum stimula-
tion settings are used. If after 1 year of continuous
comfortable stimulation there has been no change,
then it is highly unlikely that the patient will gain any
benefit. In these patients, we switch off the device for
at least 3 months before offering removal to ensure
they have not failed to recognise the extent of any
improvement.
Adverse event rates vary between centres but are
reduced if the procedure is carried out in specialist
centres.42 Hardware-related adverse events that may
require additional surgical input include lead migra-
tion (13%), lead fracture (4%) and erosion of an elec-
trode
through
the
skin
(4%).
Other
commonly
reported adverse events include pain over the battery
site (18%), infection (10%) and painful stimulation
(17%).
Proposed mechanism of action
The trigeminal cervical complex is a group of brain-
stem and cervical spinal regions at which there is an
anatomical convergence between the cervical and tri-
geminal systems. The trigeminal cervical complex is a
key relay system for pain from the head and facial
regions to higher pain processing centres in the hypo-
thalamus, thalamus and brainstem. The exact mechan-
ism of action of occipital nerve stimulation is unclear,
and it is likely to act via a non-specific modulatory
effect on pain-control systems. Fluorodeoxyglucose
positron emission tomography imaging of patients
with occipital nerve stimulation for chronic cluster
headache found that metabolism normalised in several
areas
of
the
pain
matrix
following
treatment.36
However,
the
ipsilateral
posterior
hypothalamus,
which becomes activated during acute cluster head-
aches, continued to show hyperactivation. Similar
findings with persistent hyperactivity of the dorsal
rostral pons, which becomes activated in migraine,
occurred with H2
15O-positron emission tomography in
patients undergoing occipital nerve stimulation for
chronic
migraine.43
These
findings
support
the
hypothesis that occipital nerve stimulation activates
descending pain-control systems and restores equilib-
rium in antinociceptive pathways.
SPG stimulation and the Pulsante SPG microstimulator
The SPG is an extracranial structure lying in the ptery-
gopalatine fossa containing sympathetic and parasym-
pathetic
neurones.
It
has
connections
to
the
trigeminovascular system, superior salivatory nucleus
and posterior hypothalamus—all areas that have an
important role in the generation of cluster headache
attacks. The Pulsante device is a miniaturised implan-
table neurostimulator with an integral lead and a
battery. The lead is placed within the pterygopalatine
fossa using a minimally invasive transoral approach.
The patient controls the device using a handheld
remote control. SPG stimulation is available on a
research basis in two centres in the UK. The device is
available in a limited capacity in some European sites,
principally in Denmark and Germany.

 of resolved cluster attacks within the active compared
with sham group at 15 min (67% vs 7%).44 After
2 months of treatment, 31% of the active group were
still using acute medications compared with 77% of
the sham group.
Preventative treatment of chronic cluster headache
Although the above study was designed to examine
the acute use of SPG stimulation, 43% of subjects
using the device to treat attacks reported a >50%
reduction in the weekly cluster attack frequency after
2 months.
Possible uses of SPG stimulation
An expert consensus on the use of SPG stimulation in
chronic cluster headache was published in 2014 (table
1; see online supplementary table).45 The procedure
could be considered as an acute, and possibly a pre-
ventative, treatment for those with medically refractory
chronic cluster headache who have failed all available
medical treatments. At present, recommendations are
that only those with strictly unilateral cluster attacks
should be implanted. The device may be particularly
useful in those patients who have not responded to or
who have contraindications to triptans and those who
have a high number of daily attacks.
Using SPG stimulation
As with the other invasive neurostimulation techni-
ques, SPG stimulation should only be carried out in
specialist centres and patients must be assessed for
suitability by a multidisciplinary team prior to surgery.
Immediately post implant, the patients need to be
reviewed on a 1–2 weekly basis to achieve stimulation
settings, resulting in comfortable paraesthesia in the
soft palate. At the start of an attack, the patient places
the handset to the cheek above the implant and acti-
vates the device (figure 6). Stimulation should be con-
tinued for at least 15 min. After this time, if the attack
continues, the patient should switch off the device
and use their normal rescue medication. Even if
patients stop having regular attacks, then the device
could be used as a preventative giving 15 min of
stimulation once or twice a day. There are ongoing
studies to determine the most effective preventative
regimens. Adverse events include misplacement or
migration of the leads (15%), infection (6%) or mild
transient sensory deficit in the maxillary division of
the trigeminal nerve (81%).44
Proposed mechanism of action
Cluster headache pathology probably involves inter-
action between trigeminal inputs and the cranial para-
sympathetic outflow from the superior salivatory
nucleus via the SPG. Postganglionic fibres from the SPG
innervate facial structures and meningeal blood vessels.
These fibres release neurotransmitters that activate tri-
geminal nociceptors resulting in activation of the tri-
geminal system, which, in turn, has a positive feedback
on the parasympathetic outflow. This pathway is
referred to as the trigemino-autonomic reflex.46 SPG
stimulation probably works by interrupting this system,
resulting in the termination of acute attacks via a direct
effect on the trigeminal inputs and parasympathetic
outflow; it may prevent attacks by inducing long-term
changes in neurotransmitter release.
Deep brain stimulation (ventral tegmentum/posterior
hypothalamic region)
Functional neuroimaging techniques show that the
posterior hypothalamic region is activated during
cluster headache attacks.47 Stimulation of this region
increases blood flow through areas of the pain matrix.
Deep brain electrodes were first implanted in this
region to treat a patient with cluster headache in
2001.48 Further work localised the site of implant-
ation to the ventral tegmental area rather than the
posterior hypothalamus.49
Using stereotactic imaging guidance, an electrode is
placed into the ventral tegmental area ipsilateral to
the site of pain (figure 7). The device is programmed
and kept active at all times. The method is not avail-
able for treating headache on the NHS in England.
Evidence for deep brain stimulation
Preventative treatment of chronic cluster headache
There are now >60 open-label cases of deep brain
stimulation in the treatment of chronic cluster head-
ache with an overall response rate of 66%.30 A recent
single
randomised
placebo-controlled
trial
of
11
patients treated with deep brain stimulation in chronic
cluster headache used a 1-month period of active
versus sham stimulation.50 Although there were no
differences in response rate between groups after
1 month, this may have been because of too short a
follow-up period: we now know that it takes 3–
6 months to see a response to deep brain stimulation.
Acute treatment of cluster headache
Deep brain stimulation does not help in the acute
treatment of cluster attacks.51
Possible uses of deep brain stimulation
European Headache Guidelines apply to deep brain
stimulation patient selection (table 1; see online
supplementary data table).41 Patients should have
proven refractory to all other treatments, including
other neurostimulation techniques, and need to have
normal brain anatomy. Implantation must only occur in
highly specialist centres and all candidates must have
been approved by a multidisciplinary team, including a
psychologist. There is no evidence to support the use of
deep brain stimulation in chronic migraine.
Using deep brain stimulation
Deep brain stimulation is reserved for patients with
end-of-line

chronic
cluster
headache.

Unlike the other invasive neurostimulation devices,
the patient is advised not to change their stimulation
settings. Initially patients should be followed up
3-monthly to ensure the stimulation settings are
adequate.
Current
implants

stimulation,

Deep brain stimulation carries the potential for
serious risk. There is a single reported case of a
patient with cluster headache dying from a post-
operative intracerebral haemorrhage. The overall inci-
dence of symptomatic haemorrhage in any deep brain
stimulation surgery is around 2%, although our own
highly experienced functional neurosurgery unit has
an incidence of 0.5%.52 Other adverse events from
our patients include transient diplopia or vertigo with
changes in programming (almost universal), neck stiff-
ness (12%) and pain over the implant (19%).
Proposed mechanism of action
Ventral tegmental area deep brain stimulation prob-
ably acts upon pain circuits involved maintaining
chronic cluster headache.53 Stimulation of this region
activates the hypothalamus, thalamus, somatosensory
cortex, anterior cingulate, and the ipsilateral trigem-
inal nucleus and ganglion. These structures are also
active during acute cluster attacks.54 On the basis that
the therapeutic effect takes several weeks, it has been
hypothesised
that
ventral
tegmentum
deep
brain
stimulation induces a functional modulation of the
pain processing network in cluster headache rather
than pure inhibition of hypothalamic activity.
CONCLUSION
Headache syndromes are the most common disorders
of the nervous system.1 In Europe, 1-year prevalence
of adults reporting headache was 51%, migraine 14%
and

headache

 addressing neuromodulation for headache have been
inadequate either due to lack of suitable placebo,

populations,
or
both.
Therefore,
at
present the conclusions that can be drawn from them
are limited. Given the impact of chronic headaches on
quality of life and the potential benefit that neurosti-
mulation devices has for them, we clearly need robust
randomised-controlled
trials
on
these
treatments.
There are issues involved in conducting such trials,
the main one being what constitutes an adequate
placebo. With many of these devices, there are
stimulation-related adverse effects that may unblind a
trial subject—such as paraesthesia or muscle twitching
—but which would be difficult to imitate with sham
stimulation. Another issue with previous studies has
been the use of sham stimulation where the electrical
currents are below the level believed to be clinically
effective. However, this level has never been studied
and it is possible that studies using this method have
used an active placebo, a complication in interpreting
the data. From the available efficacy data, neurostimu-
lation treatments appear similar to that of standard
drugs but the major potential benefits of the treat-
ments lie in their favourable adverse event profiles.
Although current costs are high, this may be offset in
some cases by reduced acute medication use (namely
triptans) with successful treatment. At present, these
therapies could be considered for patients with drug
tolerance issues or those who have proven medically
refractory. However, clinicians must discuss the limita-
tions of these devices and the limited evidence for
their use. In the future, if there is robust evidence
then neurostimulation devices may take a prominent
place alongside the arsenal of currently available
pharmacological treatment options for headache.
