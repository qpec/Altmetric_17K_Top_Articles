Over 20 species of asteroids were devastated by a sea star wasting disease
(SSWD) epizootic, linked to a densovirus, from Mexico to Alaska in 2013
and 2014. For Pisaster ochraceus from the San Juan Islands, South Puget
Sound and Washington outer coast, time-series monitoring showed rapid dis-
ease spread, high mortality rates in 2014, and continuing levels of wasting in
the survivors in 2015. Peak prevalence of disease at 16 sites ranged to 100%,
with an overall mean of 61%. Analysis of longitudinal data showed disease
risk was correlated with both size and temperature and resulted in shifts in
population size structure; adult populations fell to one quarter of pre-outbreak
abundances. In laboratory experiments, time between development of disease
signs and death was influenced by temperature in adults but not juveniles
and adult mortality was 18% higher in the 198C treatment compared to the
lower temperature treatments. While larger ochre stars developed disease
signs sooner than juveniles, diseased juveniles died more quickly than dis-
eased adults. Unusual 2–38C warm temperature anomalies were coincident
with the summer 2014 mortalities. We suggest these warm waters could
have increased the disease progression and mortality rates of SSWD in
Washington State.
1. Introduction
Infectious disease outbreaks are a recurrent force structuring populations of many
species. Most disease outbreaks are limited to a single host species or a related
group of hosts [1,2]. In such cases, a host–pathogen evolutionary ‘arms-race’
often prevents pathogens from becoming so virulent that they cause host mor-
tality, which can, in turn, prevent severe population declines or extinction [2,3].
In contrast, evolution of virulence in multi-host pathogens is less constrained
and can cause rapid population declines in non-reservoir species. For example,
chytridiomycosis, which occurs in over 350 species of amphibians, is associated
with widespread population declines and extinctions around the globe [4]. Simi-
larly, white spot syndrome, a virus of shrimp, affects over 78 decapod crustacean
species and is the largest recorded pandemic in the ocean [5,6]. Recent global

 increases in multi-host high-impact diseases highlight the need
to improve our understanding of the host and environmental
factors that drive patterns of infectious disease [7,8].
In many wildlife diseases, it is challenging to unravel host,
pathogen and environmental factors that influence the disease.
One approach uses patterns in nature of infection or disease
across host size or age [9], revealing information about
how these players and their environment interact [10–12].
Differential impacts of disease on size classes can affect popu-
lation recovery, especially in long-lived species where losses of
reproductive adults can dramatically reduce the population
growth rate for multiple generations [13]. These host–
pathogen interactions are embedded in a changing environ-
ment, and environmental risk factors such as warming
temperatures can alter these interactions [14,15]. In this paper,
we report on dynamics of the ongoing sea star wasting disease
(SSWD) epidemic, which began in 2013 and extends from
Alaska to Mexico, impacting more than 20 species of asteroids.
Previous asteroid wasting disease outbreaks were linked with
temperature [16–18]. Strongly positive temperature anomalies
developed in the northeast Pacific during the 2013–2014
northern winter and have persisted under the 2015 El Nin
˜ o con-
ditions. The anomalies documented were the greatest in the
area since at least the 1980s [19,20], and it is unclear if warm
temperatures may have exacerbated this outbreak.
The current outbreak of SSWD resulted in a massive mor-
tality event and is the largest documented marine disease
epizootic of a non-commercial species to the best of our
knowledge [21,22]. Sea stars with wasting disease develop
lesions in the dermis that increase in depth and diameter, dis-
solving tissue from the outside in [16,22]. One or all arms
then detach from the central disc as the sea star dies
(figure 1a–e), often leaving only white piles of ossicles and
disconnected limbs. Mass sea star mortalities during the
2013–2014 SSWD outbreak in California and Washington
were linked to a sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV,
family Parvoviridae) using experimental challenge studies
and a metagenomic analysis of field samples [22]. Previous
outbreaks of SSWD have been reported to impact popu-
lations of focal sea stars species since the 1970s in the
northeast Pacific, California and northern New England
[16,18,23]. These earlier SSWD outbreaks involved a single
species in a small region and were linked to departures in
normal sea surface temperature [16–18]. In addition to at
least 10 other species, the dominant stars affected in Washing-
ton State in this outbreak include: leather star (Dermasterias
imbricata), mottled star (Evasteriastroschelii), blood star (Henricia
spp.), six-armed star (Leptasterias hexactis), ochre star (Pisaster
ochraceus), sunflower star (Pycnopodia helianthoides), sun star
(Solaster dawsoni), slime star (Pteraster tesselatus), rose star
(Orthasterias koehleri) and Stimpson’s star (Solaster stimpsoni).
The impact of the 2013–2015 outbreak on ochre sea stars is
the focus for this paper because of the quality and consistency
of the quantitative time-series data collected as well as its
recognized ecological importance in intertidal rocky shores.
The keystone species concept was founded on experimental
demonstrations that predation by ochre sea stars structures
rocky intertidal habitats in Washington [24,25].
The objective of this study is to characterize the outbreak
timing, demographic impact and role of temperature in the
SSWD epizootic in the northeast Pacific in 2014–2015. We
use field surveys and experimental challenges to understand
how SSWD progressed in three geographically distinct
regions in and just outside of the Salish Sea in Washington
(WA) state, USA. Specifically, we test the hypotheses that
(i) disease prevalence and mortality are greater in larger
size classes of sea stars, (ii) disease signs and mortality rate
increases with temperature and (iii) breeding populations of
sea stars declined after the SSWD outbreak.
2. Methods
(a) Field surveys
Fixed plots were surveyed throughout the entire epizootic in
the intertidal zone at 16 sites within the San Juan Islands (SJI),
South Puget Sound (SPS) and the outer coast (OC) of WA between
31 December 2013 and 17 July 2015 (figure 2a–c and electronic
supplementary material, table S1). Sites were chosen where stars
were present, and plots were placed within these sites to represent
typical habitats and densities of the population. Plots were estab-
lished in the majority of the sites and varied in size, owing to the
availability of suitable habitat (see electronic supplementary
material). During each survey, all ochre stars within the fixed
plots were counted, measured and assessed for disease severity
[11]. Ochre stars were classified as diseased if they had lesions or
loss of turgor owing to tissue breakdown. Continuous water temp-
erature (every 30 min) was collected from temperature loggers
(HOBOw, Bourne, MA) placed at 0 m mean lower low water at
five of the sites. The survey sites represent a range of intertidal
ochre star habitats found in the San Juan Islands and South
Sound, WA [26]. Ochre stars under 75 mm radius were considered
juveniles as individuals below this size are not reproductive. While
some ochre stars above this size may not be reproductive, this was
the best conservative estimate available for reproductive status
without lethally sampling individuals [27].
We used logistic time-series regression to evaluate the effects
of ochre star size and temperature on the probability of being dis-
eased in SJI and SPS. Sampling was not frequent enough in OC
to analyse these data with a time-series regression. For SJI and
SPS, we used a Fourier term with one harmonic (e.g. one sine
and one cosine curve) to model the cyclical patterns of season
over time (R package ‘tsModel’). The seasonal patterns were
different enough between the two geographical regions that
model convergence was not possible with both regions in the
same model. Therefore, we fit these regions in separate models.
Once we fitted harmonic functions to these models, we then
added terms for sea star size and included site as a random inter-
cept. For the SPS model, we had to limit the data to surveys
conducted in 2013 and 2014, as a nine month time gap between sur-
veys in 2014 and 2015 prevented us from successfully modelling the
time effect. We were able to use all of the data in the SJI model.
Models were fit with sea star size data and with site as a random
intercept. The model was run in R (v. 3.1.2. package ‘lme4’). Mar-
ginal R2- and conditional R2-values were calculated for each
model using the ‘piecewiseSEM’ package [28]. The marginal R2
describes the proportion of variance explained by the fixed factors
alone, whereas the conditional R2 describes the variance explained
by fixed and random factors.
Owing to the placement of loggers, temperature data were only
available for five sites in SJI from June to December 2014. We ran a
time-series regression on this subset of data in order to understand
the effect of temperature on the probability of being diseased. For
this time period, which included four sampling events, at each of
the sites, we tried fitting the time component of the model in two
ways; we used a single harmonic function as described in the logis-
tic regressions above. We also tried fitting the time component with
linear and quadratic terms for the centred time data. These models
yielded nearly identical coefficients for temperature and size
effects, and so we report the results of the latter model, which is

 more intuitive. Because the sites were intertidal, temperatures
could be separated into submerged and exposed temperatures.
We tried fitting several terms for temperature: the mean submerged
temperature, mean exposed temperature, maximum submerged
temperature and maximum exposed temperature for each site
and time. Each of these values was calculated from the 5 days pre-
ceding the sampling event of interest. We then used Akaike
information criteria (AIC) to select the best-fitting model. Site was
included as a random effect within the model and temperature
was nested within site.
The second set of analyses of the field data were conducted to
understand how the demographics of the study populations
changed over time. Using the 16 surveyed populations, we
used paired Welch two sample t-tests (‘t.test’ function in the
‘stats’ package in R) to compare first, the population size and,
second, the mean body radius of sea stars surveyed prior to
the outbreak in 2014 and at least 1 year later, after the outbreak.
To further understand changes in population size, we compared
changes in the number of small (less than 75 mm) and large
(greater than 75 mm) sea stars across all of the sites. The
timing of the outbreak differed between the regions surveyed.
Therefore, comparisons were made for sites: in South Puget
Sound between January 2014 and May 2015, in the San Juan
Islands between June 2014 and July 2015 and on the OC between
June 2014 and June 2015. R code and datasets are available as
electronic supplementary material for all field survey analyses.

 stars (116 + 14 mm radius, mean+ s.d.) and 48 juveniles (less
than 75 mm radius) were collected on 18 June 2014 at Rosario
on Orcas Island at the early stage of the regional epidemic
(48.64418252 N, 2122.8727728 W, figure 2b). Although only visu-
ally healthy ochre stars were collected, approximately 10% of the
ochre stars at the site had visible signs of wasting disease at the
time of collection. Thus, all ochre stars may have been exposed to
the pathogen and similar recent environmental conditions.
Owing to the large spatial extent of this outbreak extending
from southern California into British Columbia, we were
unable to procure pathogen naive sea stars.
Collected individuals were placed immediately in 38 l flow-
through seawater tanks (three adult and four juvenile ochre stars
per tank) and acclimated under ambient conditions (approx.
13.58C) for 3 days. Juveniles were placed in smaller containers
within the same tanks to protect them from predation by adult
ochre stars. Water temperatures were adjusted (from ambient)
using water baths with aquaria heaters or chillers to create four
treatments (12, 14, 16 and 198C), which represent the range of
water temperatures recorded by temperature loggers at the interti-
dal sites surveyed during peak SSWD prevalence (10.6–23.08C).
Each temperature treatment was replicated three times for a total
of 12 tanks. Tanks received a constant, controlled flow of unfiltered
seawater with a temperature maintained within+18C (s.d.). This
system was indoors with controlled air temperature. Separate
flow lines were used, so there was no recirculation of water between
aquaria. Sea stars were fed frozen mussels once per day. Mussels
had been collected from a site without sea stars present. The sea
stars were examined daily for signs of wasting disease and death.
Individuals were considered dead when arm loss and/or lesions
led to loss of turgor and were subsequently removed from
experimental tanks. The experiment was terminated after 19 days.
We used a mixed-effects Cox’s proportional hazards model
(package ‘coxme’ in R v. 3.1.2) to analyse the effect of temperature
on (i) the time to disease signs and (ii) the time between disease
signs and mortality. In these analyses, tank was included as a
random effect. Because temperature did not appear to have a
linear effect on either outcome (disease signs or death), we included
the temperature treatments as factors as opposed to a continuous
numeric variable. We ran the models separately for juveniles and
adults as otherwise the assumption of proportionality was not
met. This assumption was tested by graphing the Schoenfield
residuals of the model (run without random effects) against time
(using the ‘cox.zph’ function in the ‘survival’ package in R).
Analysis of variance revealed that there were no significant differ-
ences between the models with and without the random effect
(both p . 0.1), so this was a valid approach. R code and datasets
are available aselectronic supplementary materialfor these analyses.

 (figure 3a–f). The SJI region, where no epizootic had been
documented prior to the study period, had the most severe
outbreak of the regions, with 74.0+ 6.8% (mean+ s.e.) of
sea stars showing disease signs during the peak in August
2014. Starfish Point also experienced high SSWD prevalence
(61.5 +4.1%), peaking in January 2015. Sites within the SPS
region had the lowest peak prevalence of the regions studied
(14.9 +7.5%) in August 2014 after an earlier epizootic in the
winter of that year; peak prevalence was 45% at two sites
(Titlow and Point Defiance) and 70% at one site (Ruston
Way). Only a single diseased ochre star was observed
during a year and a half of surveys at Hyde.
The models for the longitudinal time-series data included
5388 observations from SJI and 957 from SPS. Size increased
the probability of disease in both regions (table 1). A 10 mm
increase in size caused an increase in the odds of disease by
1.23, and 1.15 at SJI and SPS, respectively. The significant effects
of the harmonic terms indicate that temporal correlations above
and beyond those associated with temperature also contributed
to the probability of disease. The conditional and marginal R2
for the SJI model were 0.691 and 0.54, respectively. The con-
ditional and marginal R2 for the SPS model were 0.31 and
0.22, respectively. The relatively small differences between the
conditional and marginal R2 values in these models indicates
that size and time explained more of the variation in disease
status than the random site effects.
The subset of SJI data where temperature data were also
available contained 2012 data points from five sites sampled
between June and August 2014. The best-fitting model from
this dataset included linear and quadratic terms for day and
day squared as well as terms for ochre star size and mean
submerged temperature (table 2 and electronic supplementary
material). For every 18C increase in temperature, the prob-
ability of disease increased by 1.30 (mean; figure 4a). For
every 10 mm increase in size, the probability of disease
increased by 1.23 (figure 4b). The marginal R2 for this model
was 0.50, and the conditional R2 was 0.59.
Ochre star populations declined by 67% on average
over our study period (t19.3 ¼ 2.34, p ¼ 0.02; figures 3 and 5a).
This was driven by 80% reductions in adult populations
(t17.6 ¼ 3.03,
p ¼ 0.008;
figure
5b).
Juvenile
populations
did not change significantly in population size (t21.5 ¼ 3.03,

 varied by site, and adult ochre stars had an abundance of zero
at Colin’s Cove (SJI) and Titlow Beach (SPS) after the outbreak.
In contrast to the SJI and SPS regions, the OC site experienced a
38% increase in ochre star abundance, which consisted of
increases in both juvenile and adult stars. The average radius
of ochre stars decreased from 119 to 86 mm after the outbreak
(t25.85 ¼ 2.287, p ¼ 0.031).
(b) Experiment
All juvenile and adult ochre stars developed signs of
SSWD and died of disease during the 19-day experiment
(table 3 and figure 6a–c). The development of disease
signs was significantly affected by temperature for juveniles,
but not adults. For juvenile individuals, the hazard of
developing disease signs increased by 7% at 148

 4. Discussion
This study focuses on the variation in timing and scale of the
SSWD epizootic in three regions of Washington state and
documents large impacts to populations of the dominant
intertidal species, P. ochraceus. SSWD was first reported on
the OC of Washington in 2013; however, the peak prevalence
did not occur there until winter 2015. In contrast, there were
two distinct outbreaks of the disease in the south Puget
Sound, first in early winter 2014 and later in mid-summer
2014. The epidemic in the San Juan Islands started a full
year after the first reports and was more severe, decimating
most populations monitored in the summer of 2014. In the
San Juan Islands, adult ochre star abundances declined to
only one quarter of their pre-outbreak abundance.
In field populations, larger individuals had both greater
probabilities of being observed with disease and greater
reductions in abundance after the outbreak. This pattern is
partially reflected in the laboratory experiment, where
adults developed signs of disease more quickly. However,

 once the juveniles developed signs of infection, they died in
two days. Therefore, the lower probability of disease in juven-
ile ochre stars in the field likely reflects a lower initial disease
risk as well as recruitment and a lower likelihood of observ-
ing diseased individuals because they die more quickly. The
net result of these size effects was a drop in reproductive
adults to one quarter of their pre-outbreak populations and
a shift towards a smaller size structure in the population.
The dramatic reductions of larger adult sea stars in this
keystone species may have lasting impacts on population
recovery and the composition of rocky intertidal commun-
ities. Pre-epidemic studies on ochre stars in the Salish Sea
showed that both the average size of populations and size
structure within populations were stable during the previous
43 years [26,27,29]. This steady baseline contrasts sharply
with the population shifts found during the epidemic. The
changes in juvenile ochre stars varied considerably among
sites. Five sites showed increases in juvenile ochre star popu-
lations, whereas four showed decreases. This suggests that
complex meta-population structure may affect recruitment
among sites and provides hope that some sites may be
already recovering from declines of adult ochre stars; how-
ever, previous studies show that survival of ochre stars in
the year following recruitment can be highly variable and
may be critical for survival to adulthood in this species
[30]. Future monitoring should prioritize identification of
source populations of ochre stars that should be conservation
priorities and may reveal the extent to which the recruitment
of juvenile sea stars seen at some sites contributes to recovery.
Consistent with some other marine diseases, results from
this study suggest that changes in ocean temperature might
hasten outbreak progression and the overall severity of
impacts. However, in the ocean, increased and more variable
temperatures have been associated with disease outbreaks in
numerous species, including corals [31–34], sea urchins [35],
abalones and other shellfish [36], finfish [37] and marine
mammals [14,38]. Water temperature was identified as a facil-
itator in previous SSWD outbreaks [16,17,39]. In our field
surveys, warmer temperatures were associated with a greater
probability of being observed with disease. This suggests that
sites such as Rosario, in East Sound, which, owing to low
levels of mixing can reach summer sea surface tempera-
tures of 238

8C, might be especially susceptible to SSWD. This
geographical susceptibility, compounded with the regionally
high temperatures in the summer of 2014, which was the warm-
est on record in the northeast Pacific, could have exacerbated
the outbreak [40]. In particular, the accumulated June–
August 2014 anomaly shows sea surface temperature was
very warm in the SJI, where the disease outbreak was most
severe, but not on the OC of Washington or lower Puget

 Sound. The faster progression of disease in ochre stars in the
laboratory experiment also supports the hypothesis that anom-
alously warm temperatures in the SJI contributed to the higher
rates of disease relative to the OC and lower Puget Sound.
Temperature increased both the hazard of presenting disease
signs for juveniles and the hazard of death for diseased
adults. Regardless, increased mortality rate has opposing effects
on disease dynamics, increasing the impact of disease during an
epidemic, but potentially causing a disease to burn out owing to
the depletion of infected individuals in the population.
In addition to anomalously warm sea surface tempera-
tures, June, July and August spring tides in the San Juan
Islands and lower Puget Sound were low during the daytime,
leading to full sun exposure during the warmest parts of the
day (i.e. between mid-morning and early afternoon). In con-
trast, on the OC, low tides occurred in the early morning
during the summers, resulting in lower daytime air tempera-
tures when intertidal sea stars were exposed. Interestingly,
the air temperature to which SJI sites were exposed was not
a significant predictor of disease in our models, suggesting
that ochre stars may be avoiding warm air temperatures or
that these exposures are too short to have a lasting impact.
Further studies comparing regional variation in sea tempera-
ture changes and air temperature during exposure may show
whether exposure contributes to the regional variation in
disease prevalence and timing.
The mechanisms for temperature facilitation of disease
progression in this host–pathogen interaction are currently
unknown. Most obviously, mortality rates of most organisms
(whether infected or not) tend to increase with temperature.
Field and experimental studies suggest that ochre stars are
susceptible to metabolic stress at high water temperatures
[41–43]. Thermoregulation of ochre stars is compromised
when temperatures are more than 168C, owing to lower coelo-
mic fluid volumes [42]. In addition, metabolic demands on
ochre stars are greater at warmer temperatures (50% greater at
158C versus 108C [44]). Furthermore, warming water tempera-
tures and altered temperature variation above a species’
thermal optimum can immunosuppress hosts, thereby changing
their susceptibility to or tolerance of infection. Warm tempera-
ture could also increase pathogen proliferation up to a point
[14,40,45]. SSWD-affected tissues show pronounced tissue
degradation and proteasomal activities, suggesting that induced
necrosis of animals may result from SSaDV exposure [46].
Increased expression of immune and tissue repair genes after
infection with SSWD indicates sea stars mount a robust, and
likely energetically costly, immune response to SSaDV [46,47].
Further studies examining how thermal stress, disease signs
and energetically costly immune responses interact may reveal
the mechanisms underlying temperature dependence in SSWD.
The rapidity and unexpected nature of this outbreak leaves
us with many knowledge gaps to fill about mechanisms under-
lying the timing and severity of the outbreak, the role of
seasonal and environmental shifts in facilitating disease and
the long-term impacts of SSWD on ochre star populations
and intertidal communities. While our models were able to
explain some of the factors that predict disease status of sea
stars, the R2 values for our models indicate that other,
unknown factors are also contributing to disease. Potential fac-
tors include hydrodynamic conditions, multi-host community
structure, host density and pathogen strain. One of the bigger
mysteries is in understanding the changes that precipitated
the shift to a wide host-range and increased the prevalence of
this disease, because an outbreak of SSWD on this scale has
not previously been observed despite records of the virus
from museum specimens. It is unknown yet whether the
shifts could be due to new, more virulent pathogen strains,
changing environmental conditions, altered structure of host
populations or some combination. Continuing studies in the
within- and between-host dynamics of this disease are critical
for understanding how diseases with previously low-impact
local effects can become high-impact multi-host pandemics.
One of the concerns about this outbreak is in the impact it
will have on community dynamics. Ochre stars prey primar-
ily on mussels, but are also known to opportunistically feed
on various gastropods, barnacles and even chitons [24,48].
A possible impact of this population decline is a large
influx of mussels, with resultant changes in the community
as mussels overgrow other primary space holders, as has
been repeatedly shown with experimental removal of ochre
stars [24,25,49]. These predictions are complicated by declines
of several other keystone predators in this epizootic. For
example, SSWD-induced declines of the sunflower star,
Pycnopodia helianthoides, and the mottled star, Evasterias
troschelii, will also contribute to release of prey.
In the ocean, there are relatively few reports of large-scale
epidemics of multi-host pathogens (but see [5,50]). Similar out-
breaks in impact and host range to the current SSWD event have
been observed in frogs affected by chytridiomycosis, crus-
taceans impacted by white spot syndrome and bats affected
by white-nose syndrome. The rate of mortality at some of our
sites compares with that in some specific outbreaks in the
amphibian chytridiomycosis pandemic. For example, during
a California outbreak in the yellow-legged frog species complex
(Rana muscosa and R. serrae), 100% of the frogs from the species
complex died in just over a year [51]. In central Panama alone,
approximately 30 species were completely eradicated owing
to the disease [52]. While there are large impacts to the ochre
star populations, there are even greater impacts to the most sus-
ceptible sea star species, Pycnopodia helianthoides, which may be
at risk of endangerment (M. E. Eisenlord, C. D. Harvell,
M. Turner 2014, personal observation).
In conclusion, longitudinal monitoring revealed a steeply
accelerating epidemic of SSWD and mass mortality in
Washington State that was more pronounced in the San
Juan Islands and more attenuated on the OC and lower
Puget Sound. Warm temperatures were associated with
prevalence in the field and increased the rate of developing
disease signs and dying in laboratory experiments, leading
us to suggest the anomalously warm temperatures of 2014
increased the impact of this epizootic on the sea star popu-
lation.
The

could
cascade for years, even if the epizootic ends before killing
the remaining survivors. Despite their low abundances, the
presence of some asymptomatic ochre stars in 2015 at
the majority of the survey sites and the recruitment of juven-
iles to some of the sites leaves us hopeful for recovery in
the region. The rapid population declines associated with
SSWD follows a classic manifestation of a highly virulent,
multi-host pathogen. Given the fast progression of the out-
break and the dramatic population impacts it can have,
understanding the factors that drive SSWD continues to be
a research priority.
