Abstract
Spleen tyrosine kinase (Syk) signaling is central to phagocytosis-based, antibody-mediated platelet
destruction in adults with immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Fostamatinib, an oral Syk inhibitor, pro-
duced sustained on-treatment responses in a phase 2 ITP study. In two parallel, phase 3,
multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (FIT1 and FIT2), patients with per-
sistent/chronic ITP were randomized 2:1 to fostamatinib (n 5 101) or placebo (n 5 49) at 100 mg
BID for 24 weeks with a dose increase in nonresponders to 150 mg BID after 4 weeks. The pri-
mary endpoint was stable response (platelets �50 000/lL at �4 of 6 biweekly visits, weeks 14-
24, without rescue therapy). Baseline median platelet count was 16 000/lL; median duration of
ITP was 8.5 years. Stable responses occurred in 18% of patients on fostamatinib vs. 2% on placebo
(P 5 .0003). Overall responses (defined retrospectively as �1 platelet count �50 000/lL within
the first 12 weeks on treatment) occurred in 43% of patients on fostamatinib vs. 14% on placebo
(P 5 .0006). Median time to response was 15 days (on 100 mg bid), and 83% responded within 8
weeks. The most common adverse events were diarrhea (31% on fostamatinib vs. 15% on pla-
cebo), hypertension (28% vs. 13%), nausea (19% vs. 8%), dizziness (11% vs. 8%), and ALT increase
(11% vs. 0%). Most events were mild or moderate and resolved spontaneously or with medical
management (antihypertensive, anti-motility agents). Fostamatinib produced clinically-meaningful
responses in ITP patients including those who failed splenectomy, thrombopoietic agents, and/or
rituximab. Fostamatinib is a novel ITP treatment option that targets an important mechanism of
ITP pathogenesis.

| INTRODUCTION
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoantibody-mediated bleeding
disorder, characterized primarily by accelerated platelet destruction and
also by impairment of megakaryocyte function.1,2 The constellation of
symptoms varies between patients and can include severe thrombocy-
topenia, with bleeding ranging from none to skin and mucosal bleeding,
to intracranial, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary bleeding.2–4 Mortality
rates are very low but increase with age, certain comorbidities, and
long-term severe disease.3,5 Quality of life is often impaired in areas of
physical functioning and mental health.6–8
Patients needing treatment usually receive steroids with or without
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) as first-line therapy, but the great
majority of patients require additional treatment due to intolerability or
relapse. Current guidelines for second-line and subsequent therapies are
broad and nonprescriptive. There are many therapies available, but no

 comparative, randomized, controlled studies exist to facilitate treatment
choice.9,10 Splenectomy is the only potentially curative approach, which
is effective in a majority of patients initially, but some patients subse-
quently relapse. This surgical option is declining in use due to the avail-
ability of noninvasive options.11 Medical therapies, such as rituximab,
thrombopoietin receptor agonists, and immunosuppressive agents, have
been effective in many patients and are chosen according to physician
and patient preference. Some patients do not respond, or respond but
relapse, when treated with second line treatments and develop persistent
and then chronic disease. Those who do not improve often cycle end-
lessly through the various treatment options. Despite the multiple agents
available, there is an unmet medical need for patients with ITP.6,7,12,13
Fostamatinib, an orally bioavailable, small molecule spleen tyrosine
kinase (Syk) inhibitor, was approved in April 2018 by the US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of chronic ITP in adults
who have had an insufficient response to a prior therapy. All activating
Fc receptors signal via Syk, which has roles in cellular proliferation, dif-
ferentiation, survival, immune regulation, and cytoskeletal rearrange-
ments during phagocytosis.14–16 Syk is also linked to signaling of the B
cell receptor and has been implicated in autoantibody production.17
Inhibition of Syk using fostamatinib reduced platelet destruction in a
mouse model of passive ITP, underscoring the role of Syk in phagocy-
tosis of antibody-coated platelets.18 Clinical results with fostamatinib
were first reported in patients with chronic ITP in a single center study
in 2009. Of 16 patients, 8 (50%) achieved long-term responses, with
manageable adverse events (AEs).18 Fostamatinib was also extensively
studied in rheumatoid arthritis, demonstrating efficacy and establishing
a safety profile in a total of more than 3000 patients.19–25 This report
describes two identical, parallel, multicenter, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled, phase 3 studies comparing fostamatinib to placebo
in 150 adults with persistent and primarily chronic ITP of very long-
lasting duration, who had failed a number of prior treatments.

| METHODS
2.1 | Study design
FIT1 (NCT02076399) and FIT2 (NCT02076412) were identically-
designed, parallel, phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, pla-
cebo-controlled trials of fostamatinib compared to placebo for the treat-
ment of persistent/chronic ITP. FIT1 patients enrolled from July 2014 to
April 2016 at 35 centers in North America, Australia, and Europe; FIT2
patients enrolled from January 2015 to August 2016 at 23 centers in
Europe. Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive fostamatinib or placebo
twice daily (BID) by mouth for 24 weeks. Randomization was stratified
to balance patients with prior splenectomy and degree of thrombocyto-
penia (platelet count< or �15 000/lL). Both studies were approved by
independent ethics committees at participating centers, performed in
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and designed in accordance
with FDA Guidance. All patients provided written informed consent.
2.2 | Patients
Eligible patients had persistent/chronic ITP, in accordance with the
American Society of Hematology 2011 Practice Guidelines10 and 2014
European Medicines Agency guideline on clinical development of
medicinal products for ITP.26 Eligible patients were �18 years of age
with primary ITP for at least 3 months. The average platelet counts had
to be <30 000/lL, based on �3 qualifying counts (2 during screening)
within the 3 months preceding study entry (and no counts >35 000/lL
unless from rescue therapy). Other inclusion criteria included �1 prior
treatment of ITP and Karnofsky score �70. Exclusion criteria included:
secondary ITP, a major cardiovascular event, coagulopathy (including
prothrombotic conditions such as Factor V Leiden, APC resistance, AT-
III deficiency and lupus anticoagulant, or arterial or deep venous throm-
bosis) within 6 months, ITP Bleeding Scale Grade 2 at the screening
visit,27 poorly-controlled hypertension, or disorders that, in the Investi-
gator’s opinion, could affect the conduct of study.
2.3 | Treatments
Prior to randomization, patients had a washout period, during which
therapeutic agents, other than those allowed as concomitant ITP thera-
pies, were discontinued for up to 8 weeks. Patients were allowed to
continue one concomitant ITP medication (corticosteroids at <20 mg
prednisone equivalent per day, azathioprine, or danazol) throughout
the study without any changes if they were on a stable dose for 14
days prior to baseline. Rescue therapies (e.g., increased dosing of con-
comitant ITP therapy, IVIg, IV anti-D, steroids, platelet transfusion)
were allowed.
Fostamatinib was administered at 100 mg BID and could be
increased to 150 mg BID after 4 weeks or later, depending on platelet
count. Doses could be reduced to fostamatinib 100 or 150 mg once
daily if a dose-limiting AE occurred. The need for dose modifications
was determined during biweekly visits.
Patients who completed the 24-week study treatment could enroll
in
the
long-term,
open-label
extension
study
(Study
049;
NCT02077192). Nonresponders who were treated for �12 weeks and
received 150 mg BID of study drug for �4 weeks could also enter the
extension study.
2.4 | Efficacy and safety assessments
The primary efficacy endpoint was a stable response by week 24
(defined as platelet counts �50 000/lL on at least 4 of the 6 clinic vis-
its occurring every 2 weeks during weeks 14–24 inclusive); patients
receiving rescue medication after week 10 were considered nonres-
ponders. A secondary efficacy platelet endpoint was measured in
patients with baseline platelet count <15 000/lL: achievement of pla-
telet counts �30 000/lL and at least 20 000/lL above baseline at
weeks 12 and 24. Bleeding events were tabulated both for efficacy
and safety. Data from FIT1and FIT2 were analyzed separately and
pooled. Safety assessments and platelet counts were conducted during
biweekly clinic visits 13 times over the 24-week treatment period.
2.5 | Post hoc assessments
Post hoc assessments included overall response, which was defined as
a platelet count �50 000/lL within the first 12 weeks without rescue

 medication in the preceding 4 weeks; the initial 12 weeks were
selected since most nonresponding patients from both arms discontin-
ued FIT1 and FIT2 and entered the open-label extension study at or
very soon after week 12. Other post hoc analyses included the time to
response and median platelet counts according to response (overall or
stable response and none). Responders were categorized by age, sex,
prior splenectomy, prior rituximab use, prior thrombopoietin receptor
agonist (TPO-RA) use, ITP duration, and baseline platelet count.
2.6 | Anti-platelet antibody assay
Plasma from 60 patients in the fostamatinib group was collected 2
weeks after the first dose of fostamatinib and analyzed for the pres-
ence of platelet autoantibodies (Lifecodes PakLx kit, Immucor GTI
Diagnostics, Waukesha, WI, and indirect platelet immunofluorescence
test [iPIFT]). Platelet suspensions from 2 healthy donors were used for
autoantibody detection. Details are provided in the Supplemental
Material.
2.7 | Statistical analyses
Analysis populations included: (1) intent-to-treat (ITT): all randomized
patients, primary population for efficacy analyses; and (2) safety: all
randomized patients receiving a dose of study drug, the primary popu-
lation for safety analyses. Sample size (75 patients per study: 50 fosta-
matinib, 25 placebo) was calculated to provide 90% power for the
primary efficacy endpoint, using 2-sided, Fisher’s Exact Test with alpha
level of 0.05 and 2:1 fostamatinib:placebo allocation, assuming true
proportions 0.40 for fostamatinib and 0.05 for placebo. One patient
from FIT2, randomized to placebo, incorrectly received fostamatinib for
2 weeks; that patient’s efficacy data were analyzed with the placebo
group, but safety data with the fostamatinib group.
The primary efficacy endpoint was analyzed using the prespecified
imputation method of last observation carried forward (LOCF). A sensi-
tivity analysis was conducted such that missing data were imputed as
<50 000/mL (nonresponse). One patient in FIT2 randomized to fosta-
matinib had 5 consecutive study counts > 50 000/lL culminating at
week 16; the patient then moved and thus had to leave the study. This
patient was considered a stable responder in the prespecified analysis
using LOCF and was a nonresponder in the sensitivity analysis.
Efficacy endpoints were summarized using counts and percen-
tages, and 95% exact (Clopper-Pearson) confidence intervals (CI). A 2-
sided Fisher’s Exact Test with significance level of 0.05 was used to
evaluate efficacy. AEs were coded by the Medical Dictionary for Regu-
latory Activities (MedDRA) v18.1

| RESULTS
3.1 | Patient demographics, baseline characteristics,
and disposition
Patient characteristics at baseline were well-balanced between the pla-
cebo and fostamatinib groups, including age (median 53 vs 54 years),
sex (61% vs 60% female), and number of prior treatments (median 3
for both groups, range 1–13) except that FIT2 placebo patients had
higher median platelet counts (Table 1). Patient characteristics were
similar between FIT1 and FIT2 except that FIT1 and FIT2 patients
were from different geographic areas. Compared to FIT1 patients, FIT2
patients had a longer median duration of ITP, lower rates of prior sple-
nectomy, IVIg/anti-D, TPO-RA, and rituximab use, and higher rates of
prior cyclophosphamide, vinca alkaloids, and danazol (Table 1).
The patient characteristics illustrate a difficult-to-treat population
with long-standing ITP (median of 8.5 years and approximately 75%
had had ITP for �3 years), many attempts at prior therapy for ITP
(median of 3 unique prior therapies and as many as 13), and an average
platelet count at baseline that is typically associated with bleeding epi-
sodes (more than half were below 15 000/lL).
The 24 weeks of treatment were completed by more patients on
fostamatinib compared with patients on placebo (Supporting Informa-
tion Figure S1). Rates of and reasons for study discontinuation were
similar between studies. The majority of nonresponders on fostamati-
nib and most patients on placebo discontinued study treatment at
Week 12 to enter the open-label, long-term extension study: 88% of
patients in FIT1 and 79% in FIT2 on placebo vs. 55% in FIT1 and 66%
in FIT2 on fostamatinib.
3.2 | Efficacy
More patients on fostamatinib achieved the primary endpoint of stable
response (platelets> 50 000/mL without rescue at 4 of 6 visits, weeks
14–24) compared with placebo. Stable responses occurred in 9 of 51
(18%) patients on fostamatinib vs. 0 of 25 patients on placebo in FIT1
(P 5 .026), and in 9 of 50 (18%) on fostamatinib vs. 1 of 24 (4%)
patients on placebo in FIT2 (P 5 .152; Figure 1A). In the pooled analy-
sis, stable responses were seen in 18 of 101 (18%) on fostamatinib vs.
1 of 49 (2%) on placebo (P 5 .0003). Among stable responders, 15 of
18 (83%) responded at 5 of 6 clinic visits and 14 of 18 (77%) at all 6
clinic visits. The primary analysis was conducted using the prespecified
imputation method of last observation carried forward. Using the most
conservative sensitivity analysis where missing data are imputed as
<50 000/mL, one patient in FIT2 is then considered a nonresponder.
The FIT1 findings were unchanged. In FIT2, stable responses occurred
in 8 of 50 (16%) on fostamatinib vs. 1 of 24 (4%) patients on placebo
(P 5 .2559). In the pooled sensitivity analysis, stable responses were
seen in 17 of 101 (17%) vs. 1 of 49 (2%) on fostamatinib and placebo
respectively (P 5 .0071). These findings are not substantively changed
between the two analyses.
On fostamatinib, 43 of 101 (43%) patients achieved an overall
response, defined as at least 1 platelet count> 50 000/lL within the
first 12 weeks (including stable responders), compared with 7 of 49
(14%) on placebo (P 5 .0006; Figure 1A). Overall responses occurred in
37% of patients on fostamatinib vs. 8% on placebo in FIT1 (P 5 .007),
and in 48% on fostamatinib vs. 21% on placebo in FIT2 (P 5 .025).
Among patients with more severe thrombocytopenia at baseline (plate-
let counts <15 000/mL), an increase of �20 000/mL to a platelet count
of �30 000/mL at weeks 12 and 24 was achieved by 10/47 (21%) and

 7/47 (15%) on fostamatinib and by 1/21 (5%) and 0/21 (0%) on pla-
cebo in the pooled analysis.
The median duration of ITP at study entry was 8.7 years for stable
responders, 6.5 years for overall responders and 10.3 years for nonres-
ponders. The 8 patients between both studies with persistent ITP had
6 overall responses, 1 of which was a stable response. Overall
responses were seen across a wide range of ITP durations, including
those with a duration of <3 years (52%), 3 to <8 years (48%) and �8
years (36%); however, there was no correlation of response with dura-
tion of ITP at study entry.
Median platelet counts are shown in Figure 1B. Among stable and
overall responders, median platelet counts increased by week 2 on fos-
tamatinib and remained above 50 000/lL at nearly all time points (Fig-
ures 2A,B). By contrast, the median platelet counts for nonresponders
and placebo patients remained well below 50 000/lL for the duration
of the study with one exception. The median platelet count spiked at

 Week 18 in the placebo group based on 2 patients, the one placebo
responder and one placebo nonresponder with fluctuating platelet
counts. In the responder groups, fluctuations in median platelet counts
were more apparent in the first 4 weeks due to the use of rescue medi-
cation, which caused the exclusion of Week 2 data from 5 and 3
patients in the overall and stable responder groups, respectively.
The median time to a platelet count �50 000/lL was 15 days for
overall responders and 15.5 days for stable responders, at which time
all patients were still receiving 100 mg BID dosing except one patient
who had decreased the dose to 150 mg daily. A response was achieved
by Week 4 in 22 (51%) overall responders and 11 (61%) stable
responders. Of 101 patients on fostamatinib, 89 (88%) increased their
dose to 150 mg BID at or after week 4, including 88% of stable
responders. The median platelet count over the 24 weeks was 95 000/
lL for the stable responders and 49 000/lL for overall responders.
Responses to fostamatinib were observed across all subgroups of
age, sex, prior therapy (splenectomy, rituximab, or TPO-RA), baseline
platelet count (� vs. >15 000/mL), or duration of ITP at study entry
(Supporting Information Figure S2). Of the 47 patients with prior TPO-
RA experience, 8 (17%) had a stable response, and all 8 had discontin-
ued prior TPO-RA therapy due to a lack of effect. Numerically more of
the younger patients (<65 years) responded to fostamatinib than older
patients, and numerically more patients with platelet counts of 15–
30 000/lL responded to fostamatinib compared to those with counts
<15 000; however, sample sizes were small. Ten of 28 (36%) patients
with detectable antiplatelet antibodies achieved stable responses to
fostamatinib compared to 3 of 32 (9%) without detectable antibodies
(see Supporting Information).
Patients were allowed to continue one concomitant ITP medica-
tion throughout the study without any changes if they were on a stable
dose for 14 days prior to baseline, and 70 (46%) patients did so. Of
those, 59 (39.3%) were on corticosteroids, 5 (3.3%) were on immuno-
globulins, 7 (4.7%) were on azathioprine, and 2 (1.3%) were on danazol.
Only 2 patients with a stable platelet response were on a concomitant
medication, and both were on steroids (for 62 days and 14 years prior
to first dose of fostamatinib). Of the 43 patients with an overall platelet
response, 4 patients were on a concomitant medication, including 3 on
steroids (for 62 days, 67 days and 14 years prior to first dose of fosta-
matinib) and 1 on azathioprine (for 197 days prior to the first dose of
fostamatinib). The effect of these concomitant medications would very
likely have been evident prior to study entry and thus are not consid-
ered likely to have influenced the results.
3.3 | Bleeding-related events and rescue medication
use
Moderate/severe bleeding-related AEs occurred in 4 of 43 (9%) overall
responders to fostamatinib, (1/18 [6%] stable responders) vs. 8/49
(16%) patients on placebo (Figure 1B). Bleeding-related SAEs did not
occur in any responders to fostamatinib compared with 5/49 (10%)
patients on placebo.
There was a trend for patients on fostamatinib to receive rescue
medication less often than those on placebo (30% vs. 45%, respec-
tively; P5 .07). Among overall responders to fostamatinib, 7/43 (16%)
received rescue medication vs. 20/58 (34%) nonresponders and 22/49
(45%) patients on placebo. Among stable responders, 3/18 (17%)
received rescue medication but only during the first week of treatment.
In contrast, nonresponders received rescue medication throughout the
study period (weeks 0–24).
3.4 | Safety
In FIT1 and FIT2, 83% and 75% of patients experienced AEs in the fos-
tamatinib and placebo groups, respectively. The most commonly
reported AEs were diarrhea, nausea, hypertension, dizziness, and ALT
and/or AST increases (Table 2). Overall infections were slightly more

 frequent in patients on fostamatinib than placebo (30% vs. 21%,
respectively), but rates of moderate or severe infections were similar
(8% vs. 6%, respectively). Most cases of AEs were either mild (39% on
fostamatinib and 56% on placebo) or moderate (42% on fostamatinib
and 25% on placebo).
Similar rates of AEs leading to treatment withdrawal were reported
between treatment arms (10% fostamatinib vs. 8% placebo) but at dif-
ferent rates between studies (FIT1: 16% fostamatinib vs. 8% placebo;
FIT2: 4% vs. 9%). Severe AEs leading to treatment withdrawal in the
fostamatinib arm included 1 case each of nonserious chest pain and
syncope, pneumonia, and thrombocytopenia. Three of 43 overall
responders but none of the 18 stable responders discontinued treat-
ment due to AEs. Patients on fostamatinib had higher rates of AEs
leading to dose reductions (9% fostamatinib vs. 2% placebo) and tem-
porary dose interruptions (18% vs. 10%). The most common AEs (2%)
leading to fostamatinib dose reductions were diarrhea and hyperten-
sion. The most common AEs (�2%) leading to fostamatinib dose inter-
ruptions were ALT increased, diarrhea, and influenza-like illness.
AEs known to occur with fostamatinib and assessed as groups of
relevant preferred terms included: neutropenia (7% on fostamatinib vs
0% on placebo), gastrointestinal events (41% vs 21%), transaminase
elevation to> 3 times normal (9% vs 0%; no drug-induced liver injury
in either group), and hypertension-type events (28% vs 13%).
SAEs were experienced by 13% of patients on fostamatinib and
21% on placebo. Only 3 types of SAEs were reported in more than 1
patient in either treatment group: epistaxis (2% fostamatinib vs. 2% pla-
cebo), thrombocytopenia (1% vs. 4%), and menorrhagia (0% vs. 4%).
SAEs were considered related to study drug in 4% of patients on fosta-
matinib and 2% on placebo. There were 2 fatalities. In FIT1, a patient
on placebo died of probable sepsis 19 days after discontinuing the
study due to epistaxis. In FIT2, plasma cell myeloma led to withdrawal
of fostamatinib on Day 19 and death 71 days later. There were no
thromboembolic events.

| DISCUSSION
FIT1 and FIT2 were identical, parallel, double-blind, randomized phase
3 trials evaluating a Syk inhibitor, fostamatinib, vs. placebo in a total of
150 adult patients with persistent or (predominantly) chronic ITP. The
studies were designed in accordance with FDA guidance, using stand-
ard methods to avoid bias, and the efficacy endpoints were based on
an objective laboratory assessment of platelet count. These phase 3
studies were the first to evaluate second- or third-line treatment for
ITP in the current era of widespread use of TPO-RA and rituximab.
FIT1 and FIT2 were relatively large studies, with 75 patients each, of a
“rare” disease (ITP). These 2 studies included patients with a very long
duration of disease and a median of 3 prior treatments. In the pooled
analysis, stable platelet response, achieved by 18 of 101 patients on
fostamatinib, and overall platelet response, achieved by 43 of 101
patients on fostamatinib, were both significantly higher in fostamatinib-
treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, the
overall (including the stable) responses were associated with reductions
in both bleeding and use of rescue medication. These findings demon-
strate that almost half of patients had overall platelet responses to fos-
tamatinib, despite some not reaching the primary endpoint, and that
these responses were clinically meaningful, based on decreased bleed-
ing events and a decreased need for rescue medication and not just
numerical values. The efficacy findings were robust since the responses
were similar between the two studies and consistent with the phase 2
ITP study results. These studies led to the FDA approval of fostamati-
nib for the treatment of chronic ITP in adults who have had an insuffi-
cient response to a prior therapy.
The primary endpoint and inclusion criteria used in this study were
more stringent than those used in certain studies of avatrombopag and
eltrombopag, in which eligibility platelet counts were assessed on a sin-
gle day.28–31 The primary endpoint in FIT1 and FIT2 required patients
to achieve high platelet counts (>50 000/lL) at multiple timepoints (4

 of 6 over weeks 14–24), which is similar (although not identical) to the
pivotal romiplostim studies. In the latter study, the durable response
endpoint was met by 38% of splenectomized patients, comparable to
what was seen here.32 To provide a more complete description of
meaningful responses elicited by fostamatinib, an additional post hoc
efficacy endpoint of overall platelet response (>50 000/lL) within the
first 12 weeks of the study was assessed. Overall responders had ele-
vated median platelet counts corresponding to more consistently
increased platelet counts rather than just one increased count, support-
ing the appropriateness of this post hoc endpoint.
Most patients (75%) in the study had ITP lasting more than 3 years
(median 8.5 years) at study entry. Consistent with the long duration of
disease, this was a population with at least 2–3 prior therapies in
almost all cases. These exposures included frequent prior use of TPO-
RA-based therapy (48%), rituximab (34%), and splenectomy (35%).
More than half the patients had baseline platelet counts below
15 000/lL. During the study 16% of patients on placebo had moderate
or severe bleeding, and 45% required rescue medication. Among these
difficult-to-treat patients, Syk inhibition with fostamatinib produced
clinically meaningful platelet responses within each group categorized
by duration of ITP, prior therapy or baseline platelet count. For exam-
ple, the rate of achieving the primary endpoint was identical for those
patients who had tried and not responded to TPO-RA (17%) as it was
for the overall population (18%). Furthermore, fostamatinib potentially
represented the only effective treatment for certain patients. These
were patients who had failed to respond to all of splenectomy, rituxi-
mab and TPO-RA. This suggests that inhibition of Syk has a unique role
in the treatment of at least a small subset of adults with persistent and
chronic ITP.
Responses to fostamatinib occurred regardless of age, gender,
prior therapies (splenectomy, rituximab, TPO-RA), duration of ITP,
and baseline platelet count; however, the study was not powered
for correlation of response with these factors. Given the not signifi-
cantly better but somewhat more favorable results in the 8 patients
with persistent ITP and in those with ITP of <3 years duration, fur-
ther studies appear warranted to determine whether treatment of
patients with shorter duration of ITP would be associated with
higher response rates to fostamatinib. Other predictors of response
tentatively identified in this study included age <65 years, baseline
platelet count of 15–30 000/lL, and a potential association with
the presence of anti-platelet autoantibodies. The latter exploratory
analysis and the mouse studies18 support the hypothesis that fosta-
matinib prevents platelet loss through inhibition of autoantibody-
directed platelet destruction in ITP. In turn this suggests that
patients with predominantly autoantibody-mediated ITP may be
more responsive to Syk inhibition, as opposed to patients with T-
cell mediated disease or other mechanisms. Similar findings of the
predictive value of antibody testing were seen in one study of

 rituximab.33 Further studies are needed to explore clinical and labo-
ratory factors predictive of fostamatinib sensitivity.
Dose selection for FIT1 and FIT2 was based on results of the
phase 2 ITP study where doses up to 175 mg BID were associated
with better response rates but apparently more toxicity. Therefore, the
phase 3 trials were designed to start patients at a dose of fostamatinib
100 mg BID, with a dose increase to 150 mg BID permitted at week 4.
Almost all stable responders up-titrated to 150 mg BID to achieve and/
or sustain their responses to fostamatinib. The degree of Syk blockade
at these doses was not investigated in this study. The likelihood that
higher doses of fostamatinib would yield higher response rates is
uncertain, but there would likely be more adverse events.
The safety profile of fostamatinib was consistent with prior experi-
ence in the phase 2 ITP study and the large rheumatoid arthritis studies;
no new AEs of note were seen.18–24 The most commonly reported AEs
included diarrhea, hypertension, nausea, and transaminase elevation. An
increased rate of hypertension has been previously reported with fosta-
matinib in the Phase 2 ITP study and studies of rheumatoid arthritis20,21
and appears to be due to off-target effects on VEGFR2.34–36 Most AEs
were mild or moderate. Gastrointestinal disorders and hypertension
were medically managed as needed with antihypertensive and anti-
motility agents.37 The number of overall responders discontinuing fosta-
matinib was small (3 of 43) and did not include any stable responders;
however, other patients required dose interruption or dose reduction
because of adverse events and also medication to manage their AEs.
Limitations to these paired studies included the very long duration
of disease in enrolled patients, which exceeds that of other published
ITP studies. Furthermore, the prior use of many other well-established
treatments, e.g., immunosuppressives, rituximab, splenectomy, and
especially TPO-RA agents, likely also biased the study against a good
response to fostamatinib. Other studies have shown that responses to
rituximab and anti-CD40 ligand were lower in ITP patients with very
long disease duration.38,39
Other effective therapies for ITP are thought to inhibit platelet
destruction, e.g., IVIG, IV anti-D, vincristine, and danazol. IVIg and IV
anti-D both inhibit platelet destruction but very likely impact different
FcR receptors, which may explain their apparently additive effects.39,40
There are multiple distinct pathways involved in immune-mediated pla-
telet destruction, and treatments interfering with platelet destruction
may have nonoverlapping effects.39 This could explain responses to
fostamatinib in patients who were unresponsive to other therapies.
In summary, fostamatinib targets the Syk-mediated pathway of
platelet-destruction, producing a stable response (>50 000/lL at 4 of
6 counts during weeks 14–24) in 18% of patients on fostamatinib com-
pared with 2% on placebo and an overall response in 43% on fostama-
tinib compared to 14% in placebo. Fostamatinib has a unique
mechanism of action, dissimilar to other approved ITP therapies, and
produced responses in patients who had relapsed or not responded to
TPO-RA agents, rituximab, and/or splenectomy. The ongoing open-
label extension study will broaden the understanding of the long-term
clinical efficacy and safety of fostamatinib in adults with ITP. Future
studies will investigate whether higher response rates will be seen
when fostamatinib is given earlier in the course of ITP, further study
the mechanism of Syk inhibition, and explore which patients are most
likely to respond to treatment.
