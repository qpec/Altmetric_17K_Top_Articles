Is the ‘blue’ colour convention for inhaled reliever medications
important? A UK-based survey of healthcare professionals
and patients with airways disease
Monica Fletcher1, Jane Scullion2, John White3, Bronwen Thompson4 and Toby Capstick5
In many countries, short-acting β2-agonist inhalers have traditionally been coloured blue. This inhaled therapy has also
conventionally been known as a ‘reliever’ by patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs), in comparison with ‘preventer’
medications (inhaled steroids). With the rapidly changing market in inhaled therapy for COPD and asthma and growing numbers of
devices, there has been some concern that the erosion of traditional colour conventions is leading to patients (and HCPs) becoming
confused about the role of different therapies. In order to assess whether there was concern over the perceived changing colour
conventions, the UK Inhaler Group carried out a large online survey of patients and HCPs. The aim was to determine how patients
and HCPS identify and describe inhaled drugs, and how this might impact on use of medicines and safety. The results of the survey
highlighted the importance of the term ‘blue inhaler’ for patients with only 11.3% never referring to the colour when referring to
their inhaler. For HCPs, 95% felt colour conventions were important when referring to reliever medication. In addition, HCPs appear
to refer to inhalers mainly by colour when talking to patients. Our conclusions were that the concept of a ‘blue inhaler’ remains
important to patients and healthcare professionals. These results add to the debate about the need to formalise the colour coding
of inhaled therapies, in particular using the colour blue for inhalers for rapid relief of symptoms, as this convention may be an
important measure and contributor to patient safety. Our survey should provide impetus for all interested parties to discuss and
agree a formal industry-wide approach to colour coding of inhaled therapies for the benefit of patients and carers and HCPs.

INTRODUCTION
Inhalation is the preferred delivery route for asthma and chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) medications and therefore
has a crucial role in the management of these common respiratory
conditions.1
In the UK, parts of Europe and other countries including Canada,
Australia and New Zealand it is common practice to refer to
short-acting β2-agonist inhalers (‘reliever’ medications), such as
salbutamol, as ‘blue inhalers’ based on their colour. The word
‘reliever’ has become a common terminology for patients and
healthcare professionals (HCPs) alike as these inhalers provide
rapid relief of symptoms because of their mode of action.
The evidence that patients and HCPs frequently refer to inhalers
by colour rather than by the brand or generic name is largely
anecdotal.2
However,
the
usual
practice
of
using
colours
to distinguish mode of action has enabled patients and HCPs to
more easily differentiate reliever medications from other classes of
inhaled therapies such as inhaled steroids (the preventers). When
determining disease control and giving advice on management,
healthcare professionals often refer to inhalers by their colour.3
There is no formal agreement between manufacturers about a
colour convention for the inhalers they manufacture. Further, no
relevant legislation is issued by regulators of medicines including
the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency
(MHRA)
in
the
UK
and
European
Medicines
Agency.4
Nevertheless, this informal convention has been the accepted
practice for several decades,5,6 and is frequently quoted by patient
organisations
in
the
UK
such
as
Asthma
UK,7
as
well
as in other countries such as Australia (Asthma Australia).8
With the introduction of a wider range of new inhaler devices,
classes of drugs, compounds and combinations over recent years,
the inhaler landscape has become increasingly complex for both
HCPs and patients. In addition, as the colour coding of inhalers is
no longer consistent, it has the potential to cause unnecessary
confusion and safety issues. In the UK currently 18 licensed
medications are available as either single or multiconstituent
inhaled preparations for use in the treatment of asthma and
COPD.9 An increasing array of colours is now being used by
pharmaceutical companies to differentiate the treatments within
their
own
product
range,
rather
than
demonstrating
any
conformity to specific colour conventions, perhaps apart from
the choice of blue for relievers.
In the last two years two inhalers with significant amounts of
blue colouring on them have been licensed for use in the UK10,11
although neither product was licensed for the emergency relief of
symptoms. Issues regarding patient safety were expressed by the
respiratory community, which was concerned that this would have
misled patients resulting in inappropriate use with attendant risk.
After significant lobbying from patient and professional organisa-
tions, both companies changed to a colour other than blue for
their inhaler devices.12,13

 The UK Inhaler Group (UKIG), formed of 11 UK-based patient
groups, professional organisations and societies interested in
respiratory issues, sought to establish whether the blue colour
convention for reliever medications is an important issue for both
patients and HCPs. UKIG therefore undertook a survey in
September 2015 to establish the views of people living with
asthma and/or COPD and HCPs.
RESULTS
Healthcare professional survey
A total of 596 individuals responded to the HCP survey.
Respondents identified their professional background as follows:
39%
nurses;
17%
doctors
(GPs
or
hospital
doctors);
14%
respiratory physiologists; 13% pharmacists; and 8% other allied
health professionals such as physiotherapists, healthcare assistants
and pharmacy assistants; 9% did not specify their profession.
The
most
commonly
reported
method
for
healthcare
professionals in identifying inhalers was to refer to their colour,
with 45.6% reporting this to be their usual practice, 21.2% who
reported that this was often their practice, whereas only 0.9%
reported never referring to inhalers by colour. This is in contrast to
19.0% whose usual practice was to use brand names, and 13.6%
whose usual practice was to use generic names (Table 1). Overall,
it was apparent that most HCPs use a mixture of methods
(colour, brand name and generic name) to refer to inhalers, but
the majority of HCPs (86.8%) reported that they usually or often
described the colour to refer to inhalers to patients. Two-thirds
(66.7%) of respondents also reported that they usually or often
also used the brand name to refer to inhaled medicines, but less
than half (45.4%) used the generic name.
A total of 521 respondents (89%) said they used the terms
relievers and preventers when talking to patients about their
medications. In addition, nearly 95% of the HCPs felt colour
convention to be important (Table 2). In fact, 87% felt it would be
helpful if all relievers were coloured blue, and if a colour
convention was to be retained it should be that all blue inhalers
should be relievers. Only 11% felt that the broadening of the
range of available inhaled medications had eroded the traditional
colour conventions and agreed that the use of such colour
conventions was now meaningless.
When asked whether they would like to add any further
comments about the traditional colour conventions for inhalers,
there were 241 additional comments from HCPs. The findings of
the content analysis of respondents comments, together with
representative quotations for each relevant emergent theme and
cluster, are provided in Table 3. The most frequently encountered
themes included the importance of maintaining the blue colour
coding of reliever inhalers, recognising that it could be difficult
but desirable to do this for other drug classes, and the difficulty for
patients to remember drug names.
Patient survey
A total of 2,517 people with airways disease responded to the
patient survey. Of these, 390 were excluded from the survey
because they either did not specify what lung disease they had
(n = 303), they had another lung disease other than asthma or
COPD (n = 77) or they did not know their diagnosis (n = 10). Of the
2,127 patients included in the study, 82.5% (1,755) had asthma,
160 (7.5%) had asthma and COPD and 212 (10%) had COPD.
A total of 1269 (60%) patients said they used the terms reliever
and preventer when talking about their inhalers. Patients most
frequently reported that they usually identified their inhaled
medication by describing either the colour (49.8%) or brand name
(35.4%),
rather
than
by
the
generic
drug
name
(18.7%;
Table 4). Only 11.3% of patients never referred to their inhaler
by colour when talking to a HCP, whereas nearly 1 in 5 (18.2%)
never used the brand name and more than a quarter (28.6%)
never used the generic name. Patients with asthma and COPD
were similar in their likelihood of using colour to refer to their
inhalers. However, COPD patients were more likely than those
with asthma to also usually refer to their inhalers by brand name
(48.9% vs. 35.1%, Po0.005) or generic name (34.1% vs. 16.7%,
Po0.005).
There are several responses indicating that colour has an
important role in patients’ understanding of their medications
(Table 5). Two most notably are that almost 80% of patients
(1,674) strongly agreed/agreed that they like knowing that blue
inhalers are there to relieve symptoms and 54% (Q3e) would be
concerned if a preventative inhaler was mainly blue. Responses to
two questions (Q3h and Q3i) suggest that it would not be easy to
discontinue the practice of referring to inhalers by colour. Almost
90% felt if there was one colour tradition that should be kept, it
would be that blue inhalers are to relieve symptoms.
However, about half the respondents felt that it was more
important to understand the role of the medications contained
within the inhaler rather than the colour (Q2).
Patients with asthma were more likely than those with COPD to
have strong opinions about the colour of inhalers, although a
higher proportion of patients in both groups agreed that colour of
inhalers was an important issue. In contrast, patients with COPD
were more likely than those with asthma to have stronger
opinions about the need to understand what each medicine was
for and know the name of their medicines.
Patients provided further comments on the use of inhalers. The
findings of the content analysis of respondents’ comments,
together
with
representative
quotations
for
each
relevant
emergent theme and cluster, are provided in Table 6. The most
frequently encountered themes again included the importance of
maintaining colour conventions for inhalers, in particular, restrict-
ing the use of blue colour for reliever inhalers and how this aids
not only the patient but also family, friends, colleagues and school
teachers. A total of 88 respondents reported that they were not
aware of an association prior to completing this survey, although
at least seven of these were patients in countries such as USA and
Brazil where no such colour convention exists. A total of 30
respondents suggested alternative colours for inhalers, with some
suggesting on more consistent colours for preventer inhalers and
six suggesting that red would be more suitable as a colour to
emphasise the emergency role of reliever inhalers.

 DISCUSSION
Main findings
Although recognising the limitations of a survey approach, this
survey provides a message that patients and HCPs like to use the
term ‘blue inhaler’ and that clinicians in this study predominantly
refer to inhalers by colour when talking to patients. At the same
time there was some indication that patients used a mix of colour
and the brand name of the medicine in the inhaler, particularly
those with COPD.
The informal colour convention for inhalers appears to be
helpful in aiding communication between HCPs and patients. It
helps patients understand the different role of their inhalers, and
how they should be taken, which is particularly useful for
discussing the difference between relievers and preventers.
With more inhalers coming onto the market, the choice of
treatments is going to continue to widen. It would appear that the
majority favour keeping the colour blue for relievers.
Without
this
colour
convention,
patient
education
could
become more complex and could cause confusion. This could
be the case particularly for those who are not HCPs, who have
responsibility to care for children and adults with asthma, such as
school teachers and social care workers, and indeed parents
themselves. This raises concerns regarding patient safety.
Colour coding has been used in a wide range of heterogeneous
healthcare settings in a multitude of ways such as syringe labelling
in anaesthetics.14–16 In developing countries colour coding in
healthcare is an important tool to promote the extension of
quality assured healthcare services provided by outreach workers
and unqualified healthcare providers.17
Any change to the colour convention would require a major
re-education of HCPs, and more importantly, patients and their
carers. However, a potential amendment is the use of a system of
embedding standardised coloured circles or dots onto the casing
of the inhaler.18 This would allow for combinations of medications
and their actions to be easily explained to patients. The authors of
these recommendations, however, stress that a blue dot should be
universal for a short-acting beta agonist.
An alternative view suggests that differentiating inhalers by
colour may cause problems to some patients because of colour
blindness. It is estimated that 8% of men and 0.5% of women
worldwide have a colour vision deficiency.19 However, illiteracy is
a far bigger problem worldwide and an inability to perceive blue
light (tritanopia) is an extremely rare form of colour vision
impairment affecting as few as 1 in 30,000–50,000 and therefore is
less of an issue regarding the blue inhaler, but nevertheless a
consideration.20
Whatever future decisions are taken about the ways of
distinguishing inhalers, patient safety is of paramount importance.
There are therefore major implications for licensing authorities
and groups focused on this aspect of patient safety.
Interpretation of findings in relation to previously published
work
There are little other published data addressing this subject, and it
is remarkable that studies designed to clarify this debate have not
taken place, despite the expansion of inhaled therapies for airways
disease.
Strengths and limitations of this study
This study is a survey of the views of patients and HCPs and not a
clinical trial; therefore, our findings will need confirmation in
further studies. Demographic data such as age, gender and age
when diagnosed were not collected, but would have been useful
in the interpretation and understanding of the results. The
questionnaires were self-completed, so we are unable to verify
that all respondents have the conditions asthma and/or COPD, as
in any survey. In our view, this is counter balanced by the large
number of responses we were able to obtain using this survey
method. As we used a web link to distribute the survey via
multiple access points, it was not possible to prevent duplicate
responses or to determine if they occurred, nor could we gather
responses from those without access to electronic media or those
with reading difficulties. Another limitation was that it was not
possible to determine how many individuals accessed the survey
and then subsequently declined to participate, so a response rate

How healthcare Professionals refer to inhalers, and selected quotations
Relevant Emergent Themes (no. of HCPs reporting)
Relevant quotations to illustrate theme
Colour of inhalers
Importance of blue colour (168)
‘Colour is useful particularly when explaining to people with learning disabilities, dementia,
those who can't read and young children’
‘I think having the colour codes is a huge safety net that should never be changed. In an
emergency it is lifesaving.’
Colour scheme for other classes of inhaled
therapy (40)
‘Combination inhalers should show both colours I.e. if all LABA were blue, all LAMA were
green and combination inhalers had both colours on.’
‘(it) would be great to also be able to use colours to indicate types of combinations—isnt [sic]
just patients who dont [sic] know!’
Difficulties in achieving colour conventions (30)
‘I just think we need to be preparing ourselves for getting away from colour connections as
with the influx of new devices and more to come it is probably safer to talk about relivever
[sic], preventers, combinations etc.’
‘Perhaps a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted on this one but would
have been good to establish a convention (relievers, LABAs, LAMAs, ICS, etc) whilst the
opportunity was available.’
Vision problems (5)
‘Colour conventions do not work if your patient is blind or partially sighted.’
‘Take colour blindness into account when considering colours for inhalers.’
Nomenclature
Using drug name (22)
‘I only use the colour as an adjunct. I also say the brand name and describe the job it does.’
‘Most patients are aware of the proper names of their inhalers, but I find that the more elderly
find it easier to refer to them by colour’
Difficulty with drug names (26)
‘I find quite a lot of patients do not know the name or nature of their inhalers and only refer to
them by colour—this is the only way I can then identify what regime they are on’
‘Not all patients understand medication names, they are often long and complicated. Also, the
use of generic names as well as brand names can make it further complicating. We need
colour AND names for differing needs of patients.’
Other methods to refer to inhalers
Mode of action (34)
‘Patients need to be made more aware of relievers and preventers’
‘…I think a better system could be a wording on the product of ‘RELIEVER’ and ‘PREVENTER’ in
a standard font, in a box, and possibly coloured!’
Importance to combine methods to educate
patients (25)
‘Colour convention is particularly helpful where patients have reduced capacity of
understanding. I would also use generic/brand names/reliever/ preventer terms etc if
possible/according to each patients capability—without confusing them!!’
‘I like to use different terms and fit them to suit my patients understanding as some work
better with names and I think they should show the name. However most people don't know
the name but remember the colour more easily.’
Patient factors
Patient comprehension and education (32)
‘If patient has dementia for example the traditional blue colour is much easier for them to
remember as it has been the same for years.’
‘Poor health literacy for many patients means that terms we think are simple such as reliever
and preventer can be confused.’
‘I think patients are more adept at understanding than we give them credit for and actually
taking time to talk and provide education in a consistent manner is more important.’
‘Educating the patient about their treatment is the most important over colour coordinating
inhalers as a poorly educated patient will still get confused with colours’

 cannot be estimated: nor did it include those without access to
electronic media or those with reading difficulties.
This survey was designed specifically to target the opinions of
UK patients and HCPs using social media and websites to promote
the survey; however, as these access points are also available to
people outside of the UK, we found that some patients from
outside the UK also completed the survey. As a colour convention
may not be the norm in other countries, this could potentially
have affected our results. As we did not collect the data
on country of residence, we cannot be certain about how many
Table 6.
How patients refer to inhalers, and selected quotations
Relevant Emergent Themes (no. of Patients
reporting)
Relevant quotations to illustrate theme
Colour of inhalers
Importance of blue colour (196)
‘I think it is useful that blue is synonymous with reliever inhalers, as asthmatics and many non-asthmatics know
what type of inhaler that is and in an emergency it's good to just be able to call it by its colour rather than
remember the brand name.’
‘My 7 year old knows the blue one is for when I am having an attack. It's useful to tell people I need the blue one
and quicker therefore to get the medicine I need.’
Impact of colour association (total 273)
‘Blue has always been known as reliever for many asthmatics and brown the preventer, but there are other
inhalers which are preventer/reliever combos such as seretide and symbicort and long acting relievers which
come in green coloured inhalers’
‘The different colours are very helpful for my asthma as each colour helps me to associate what each inhalers
job is. If they were all the same colour I don't think I would cope!’
‘People often associate the colour with a 'reliever' or 'preventer', people associate and remember colours easier
than names.’
‘I think during an attack the colour recognition is extremely important. I also feel it is important to understand
the medication within your inhaler and its role in treating asthma however the colour in a serious attack is
extremely important’
‘There are too many different colours and...it is much more important to know what they are by brand name
such as salbutamol or ventolin’
Alternative colour suggestions (30)
‘It would make sense if the relievers were of a red colour. Relievers are used to relieve symptoms of possible
attacks; red indicates urgency!.’
‘The well known colours for preventers could be changed but please don't change the blue relievers.’
Colour scheme for other classes of
inhaled therapy (31)
‘The preventer inhalers' shades can be too similar (brown, brown-ish, brown but more red... red)—I've seen this
confuse asthmatics and specialist chest doctors alike.’
‘With Symbicort SMART being used more and more often, it's making the use of the term ‘blue inhaler’ more
difficult to transfer to other inhalers that aren't blue and for people to understand their purpose.’
Experience outside of the UK (7)
‘This isn't the case in all countries—e.g., in the USA some relievers are yellow/orange rather than blue, so it
doesn't make sense to rely on colour rather than the actual name and function of the medication.’
‘I've just started using Relvar Ellipta and I struggle to explain to my husband which one I need because they are
all blue! ‘
Vision (34)
‘I am visually impaired and rely very much on the colour of my inhalers. It's also great to be able to say go my
kids please fetch my blue inhaler for example and know they get the right one.’
‘The colours are great, though the shape is more important when you take into consideration colour blindness
and actual blindness.’
No association (88)
‘Have never even considered the colours as I know the names, what each is prescribed for and the dosage/times
to use.’
‘I hadn't even realised that reliever inhalers were blue and preventers other colours…and I've been taking
asthma meds for over twenty years...’
Impact on friends, family, carers,
colleagues (156)
‘I think blue is helpful for relievers for school staff when helping children to use medication as it is currently a
universal idea.’
‘it's also easier for the people I am with to know, i.e., family and partners know to grab the blue inhaler when I
am having an attack’
Resistance to change (152)
‘Keep the blue colour for reliever. Everyone knows the blue inhaler is the one needed during an asthma attack.’
Ease of understanding (153)
‘Easy to understand that blue is the reliever inhaler and other colours preventers’
‘The different colours are very helpful for my asthma as each colour helps me to associate what each inhalers
job is. If they were all the same colour I don't think I would cope!’
Nomenclature
Using drug name (51)
‘Lucky for me I understand mine, and are happy to use the name, although I sometimes don't pronounce it
properly but most clinician's know what I mean, & understand me.’
‘Understanding your different medicines by name and intention is...important.’
Difficulty with drug names (53)
‘Most inhalers have unpronucable names..if referring to these inhalers by colour its [SIC] easier for the patient to
understand’
‘For me and the people I have talked to that have asthma it is a lot easier to remember colours than the
complicated names. ‘
Other methods to refer to inhalers
Mode of action (50)
‘...it is important to know what each one is called medically and what it does not just by colour.’
‘It is very important to understand the inhalers as ‘preventers’ and ‘relievers’
, for me these have been explained
fully by health professionals, and the association of the colours goes hand in hand with that.’
Importance to combine methods to
educate patients (14)
‘...people should be educated on their meds and not rely on colours.’
‘I think for asthma patients, it is much more important to understand what medicine is contained inside the
inhaler and how that medicine works and is to be used, rather than simply referring to the inhaler as by colour.’
Shape of the inhaler (17)
‘The colours are great, though the shape is more important when you take into consideration colour blindness
and actual blindness.’
Patient factors
Patient comprehension and education
(149)
‘It's easier using colours especially for young children to understand which to use and when’
‘Using the same colour overall for reliver inhalers is useful for both children and the elderly and also for people
with learning difficulties’

 responders
were
non-UK
residents.
Review
of
individual
comments alerted us to the fact that at least seven patients lived
or have lived in other countries, but we cannot be certain whether
other responders were also non-UK residents. Consequently, we
did not correct the data for the seven patients we knew to be
non-UK residents, as this could have excluded non-UK data in an
incomplete manner. As our invitation letter specified that this was
a UK survey, we believe that there will have been a negligible
number of respondents from outside of the UK, and consequently
would not have adversely affected our results.
We accept that there are disadvantages to surveys in that
respondents may not feel encouraged to provide accurate, honest
answers and that surveys with closed-ended questions may have a
lower validity rate than other question types. We recognise that
answers rely on interpretation by the respondent and that it will
always be the interested parties that respond to surveys. We also
acknowledge that HCPs with an interest in colour conventions
may be more likely to have taken part although this may not apply
to the large numbers of patients who participated.
Although it was not our intention to introduce bias into the
study, it could be considered that there was bias towards the
'usefulness of colour conventions' because of the questions
focusing on colour. This focus could be seen to narrow the
research question being asked. Further research concentrating on
the question construction would assist with generalisability of our
findings.
However, these points can be mitigated by the fact that surveys
are relatively easy to administer, are cost-effective and capable of
collecting data from a large number of respondents. They give the
flexibility to ask a number of questions and can be analysed with
appropriate software.
There was also a strong theme in about half of our respondents
who felt that it was more important to understand the role of the
medications contained within the inhaler rather than the colour.
Of interest only 11% felt that the broadening of the range of
available inhaled medications had eroded the traditional colour
conventions and agreed that the use of such colour conventions
was now meaningless (statement 11). However whether this
question was answered on the grounds of the many coloured
combinations inhalers is unclear as it seems incongruent with
former statements.
Implications for future research, policy and practice
As the limitations previously identified in these results may not be
representative, these surveys appear to highlight that inhaler
colour is important and that there is a desire from HCPs and
patients alike that the blue convention is maintained for patient
safety issues. In terms of safety and governance until there is a
shift away from current practice it appears implicit that colour
coding should be standardised and reinforced.
It is inevitable that increasing numbers of inhalers will be
introduced into the already complex environment which will no
doubt widen the range of colours of inhalers. This may be more
important for HCPs than for individual patients, who usually only
have 1–3 inhalers.
There appears a need to take on board the views of clinicians and
patients when considering inhaler device colour conventions.
Colour needs to be given greater consideration by both pharma-
ceutical companies and licensing authorities to focus on the safety
of patients when designing inhalers and selecting the colour.
HCPs also need to consider how they discuss inhalers with
patients in order that patients understand how to use different
types of inhalers and get maximum benefit from them. They
should also recognise that many patients, particularly those with
COPD, may also value provision of other descriptive information
about their inhaled medicine, including the mode of action and
generic/brand name.
Conclusion
The importance of blue as the emergency inhaler is greater in
asthma than in COPD, but understanding the role of different
inhalers is still important in COPD to aid compliance, so that
patients and NHS get best value from their treatments.
Consistency
of
colouring
of
inhalers
should
reduce
the
likelihood of error and may help to reduce the risk of asthma
deaths; however, there is currently a lack of standardisation. This
study confirms that clinicians are systematically using colours to
refer to inhalers in discussions with their patients, and patients do
the same. Of all the informal colour conventions, the use of blue
for inhalers to be used for rapid relief of symptoms is most
commonly adhered to and therefore of greatest importance to
protect, particularly given the need for accurate use in acute
situations. The ‘convention’ is still widely used in the UK and the
results of this study suggest that, certainly at least in the short-to-
medium term, this should be retained. Formalisation of this
convention should be agreed, to promote patient safety, so that in
future it would not be possible for a blue inhaler to obtain a
license unless it is a reliever, and conversely that an inhaler that is
not for rapid symptom relief will not be licensed if it is blue.
As new inhaled medications with different mechanisms of
action will undoubtedly come to market in the future, this study
suggests that the issue will need to be openly debated and that
there should be widespread consultation with HCPs, patients, the
pharmaceutical industry and those with the power to enforce
legislative changes. It is not desirable or appropriate and may be
costly for individual companies to make unilateral decisions, which
could affect both patient safety and also adherence rates, and has
been expressed as a concern by healthcare professionals.21
Colour conventions across all inhaler device classes may now
have practical shortcomings as the number and types of inhalers
have greatly expanded and will undoubtedly continue to do so.
However, retaining the blue convention for reliever medications is
still in our hands if we wish to preserve and indeed strengthen this
on the grounds of patent safety.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
An overarching online self-reported questionnaire was developed by a
multi-professional group of HCPs and patient representatives of groups
within UKIG. Two versions were then created, using slightly different
terminology for people with asthma and COPD and their carers, and HCPs.
Each was piloted by five patients and five HCPs in order to assess the
appropriateness of the terminology used, test the survey instructions and
to establish the time required to complete the survey. As a result two
questions were removed entirely and some minor adjustments were made
to the instructions and terminology.
Having given consideration to the required response rates, survey design,
cost implications and timeframes, the decision was made to administer the
survey via the internet, using SurveyMonkey (SurveyMonkey, Palo Alto, CA,
USA [www.surveymonkey.com]). SurveyMonkey has been successfully used
in published healthcare research and is a useful tool when widespread
geographical coverage is desired.22 The results of the surveys were analysed
using the software available from SurveyMonkey.
During a 4-week period, the surveys were made available to patients with
a diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD and a range of HCPs from around the
UK. The two surveys ran in parallel from 2 September 2015 to 5 October
2015. A generic website link for the survey was created, and the link was
distributed in several ways including sending an email with the link to
potential respondents on existing databases, placing the survey link on each
of the UK-based organisations’ websites and using social media sites such as
Twitter and LinkedIn. This methodology allowed for confidentiality for
respondents and widespread awareness of the survey.
The invitation letter contained information about the survey as well as the
web link that potential participants needed in order to gain access to it. The
letter
explained
that

formed
with the common desire to ensure that patients and the NHS get the
maximum benefit from inhaled medications; of particular interest were the
views on the colour of inhalers. Informed consent was assumed by the fact
that all participants had to voluntarily access the web link to complete

 the survey. Although the surveys were made available through a variety of
sources, it was requested that potential respondents completed it only once.
An exploratory analysis, using Chi-square statistical testing, was
performed to investigate potential differences in opinions on the colour
of inhalers between groups of patients with a diagnosis of asthma or
COPD. No sample size calculation was performed as this was purely an
exercise to investigate trends in opinions and not intended to be a
definitive analysis.
A content analysis of responders’ comments was used to code the
qualitative data into themes and categories, to evaluate the emergent
topics that were highlighted by patients and healthcare professionals. This
analysis was performed by one author (T.C.) and reviewed by all other
reviewers in order to agree that the final categorisations were accurate.
