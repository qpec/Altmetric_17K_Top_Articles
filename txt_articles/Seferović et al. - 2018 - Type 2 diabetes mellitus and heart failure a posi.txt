disorders in the clinical practice. There are no specific limitations to HF treatment in T2DM. Subanalyses of trials
addressing HF treatment in the general population have shown that all HF therapies are similarly effective regardless
of T2DM. Concerning T2DM treatment in HF patients, most guidelines currently recommend metformin as the
first-line choice. Sulphonylureas and insulin have been the traditional second- and third-line therapies although their
safety in HF is equivocal. Neither glucagon-like preptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, nor dipeptidyl peptidase-4
(DPP4) inhibitors reduce the risk for HF hospitalization. Indeed, a DPP4 inhibitor, saxagliptin, has been associated
with a higher risk of HF hospitalization. Thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) are contraindicated in
patients with (or at risk of) HF. In recent trials, sodium–glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, empagliflozin
and canagliflozin, have both shown a significant reduction in HF hospitalization in patients with established CV disease
or at risk of CV disease. Several ongoing trials should provide an insight into the effectiveness of SGLT2 inhibitors in
patients with HFrEF and HFpEF in the absence of T2DM.

Introduction
The coexistence of heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes mellitus
(T2DM) is common and has a strong impact on clinical manage-
ment and prognosis. T2DM is associated with worse clinical status
and increased all-cause and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in both
patients with HF with reduced (HFrEF) and preserved ejection
fraction (HFpEF), compared to HF patients without T2DM.1 Con-
versely, HFrEF is an independent predictor of fatal and non-fatal
clinical outcomes in patients with T2DM.2,
3 The major causes of
HF in T2DM include coronary artery disease (CAD) and hyper-
tension, but also, a possible direct detrimental effect of T2DM on
the myocardium.4 This position paper provides advice and educa-
tion pertinent to the clinical management of patients with T2DM
and HF. The document summarizes the epidemiology and cur-
rent understanding of the mechanisms underlying the intersection
between T2DM and HF. It further presents contemporary treat-
ment options for patients with established T2DM and HF, and
summarizes recent evidence of HF prevention with drugs used to
treat T2DM.
Epidemiology
Prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus
and heart failure in general populations
The prevalence of T2DM, which encompasses 90–95% of diabetic
individuals, has globally increased from 4.7% in 1980 to 8.5% in
2014,5 albeit diagnostic criteria have changed over that period.6,
7
Contemporary data suggest a stable overall HF prevalence of
11.8% (range 4.7–13.3%) in the general population.8
Prevalence of heart failure in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus
In the Reykjavik study in the general population, the prevalence of
HF in people with T2DM was 12%.9 In this study, HF was more
common in patients with T2DM aged >70 years (i.e. 16% and 22%

of men and women, respectively). In the Kaiser Permanente pop-
ulation, patients with T2DM aged <75 years had an approximately
three-fold higher prevalence of HF compared to those without
T2DM.10 In those aged 75–84 years, T2DM was associated with a
doubling of risk for HF. In these relatively old studies, HF pheno-
type (i.e. HFrEF or HFpEF) or biomarker status was not reported.
In clinical trials of T2DM patients, the prevalence of HF at baseline
has varied between approximately 10% and 30% (Table 1).11–24

marked regional differences have been observed both in Europe
and in rest of the world. In studies conducted in Iceland9 and Italy,27
T2DM prevalence was four and three times higher, respectively,
whereas in Italy, T2DM prevalence was almost doubled in HF
subjects (Table 2). Approximately 25% of patients with HF in
England25 and Denmark28 also had T2DM. Despite younger age
and less obesity, a significantly higher prevalence of T2DM (57%)
was observed in a population-based cohort of Southeast Asian HF
patients compared to Caucasian patients (24%).30 The reasons for
the wide regional variation in T2DM prevalence in HF patients
warrant further international studies with shared study design and
standardized data collection.
In clinical trials of chronic HF patients, the prevalence of T2DM
was around 30%, irrespective of HF phenotype (i.e. HFrEF and
HFpEF) (Table 3).31–48 The highest prevalence of T2DM was seen
in trials of acute HF (around 40%).
In registries of hospitalized HF patients in North America and
Europe, the prevalence of T2DM is around 40–45%,49–52 and a
slight increase in the prevalence was reported in North America
over time.49,
52. In the Swedish HF Registry (68% from hospitals and
32% from primary care), T2DM was more prevalent in HF patients
with CAD compared to those without (30% vs. 19%).53
Incidence of new type 2 diabetes mellitus
in patients with heart failure
In patients with HF, data from observational and clinical trials
demonstrate an increased risk for new-onset T2DM compared to
patients without HF. In a Kaiser Permanente study, the incidence
of T2DM was significantly higher in patients with than without HF
(i.e. 13.6/1000 vs. 9.2/1000) over a 5-year follow-up.10 In a Danish
nationwide cohort study, 8% of HF patients developed T2DM over
3 years, and the severity of HF was associated with a stepwise
increased risk of developing T2DM.54 Similar incidence of T2DM
was reported in clinical trials of HF patients, as demonstrated by
the CHARM program, in which 7.8% of patients developed T2DM
over 2.8 years.55,
56 In the EMPHASIS-HF trial including HFrEF
patients, the incidence of T2DM was 3.7% over a median follow-up
of 21 months.57 Notably, HF treatment with angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors was shown to lower the incidence of
T2DM in HFrEF patients; in a substudy of the SOLVD trial, 6%
of patients in the enalapril arm developed T2DM over a mean

follow-up of 2.9 years as opposed to 22% in the placebo arm.58
Registry data corroborate that the use of renin–angiotensin system
inhibitors is associated with attenuated risk for T2DM in HF
patients receiving loop diuretics.54 Clinical trials also demonstrated
that the severity of HF, as indicated by a higher New York Heart
Association (NYHA) class, increases the likelihood of developing
T2DM.27,

Incidence of heart failure in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus
Recently, a population-based study of 1.9 million patients
with T2DM without overt CV disease, followed for 5.5 years,

demonstrated that incident HF was observed more frequently
(14.1%) than vascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI)
or stroke.60 T2DM is an independent risk factor for the devel-
opment of HF.10 In a retrospective cohort followed for up to 72
months, patients with T2DM were more likely to develop HF
than patients without T2DM (incidence rate 30.9 vs. 12.4/1000
person-years, rate ratio 2.5).61 In elderly patients with T2DM,
the incidence of HF was two-fold higher compared to patients
without T2DM (121 vs. 62 cases/1000 patient-years).62 In the
UKPDS 35 trial including newly diagnosed diabetic patients, HF
incidence steeply increased with the severity of dysglycaemia
ranging from 2.3 to 11.9/1000 person-years for patients with gly-
cated haemoglobin (HbA1c) <6% and HbA1c >10%, respectively.63
Similarly, in observational studies (NHANES64 and ARIC65), the
incidence of HF in patients with T2DM was higher than in those
without T2DM, with the corresponding hazard ratios (HRs) of
1.85 and 3.54. Indeed, in the ARIC study, higher HbA1c levels in
T2DM patients were associated with significantly more incident
HF cases than in patients with T2DM and lower HbA1c levels.65
The incidence of HF in T2DM patients compared to those with-
out T2DM is even higher in patients with established CAD, in
which each 1% increase in HbA1c level was associated with a 36%
increased risk for HF hospitalization.66,
67 Patients with pre-diabetes
in the ARIC study also had more HF than those without
pre-diabetes.68
Type 2 diabetes mellitus, clinical
status and outcomes in patients
with heart failure
Clinical presentation, quality of life
and functional status of patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart
failure
Patients with T2DM and both HFrEF1,
34,
69,
70 and HFpEF1 have
worse NYHA functional class and more HF-related symptoms
and signs than patients without T2DM, despite having similar
ejection fraction.69,
70 In the SOLVD-Prevention trial of patients
with asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, patients
with T2DM were more likely to progress to symptomatic HF than
those without T2DM, although the increased risk appeared to be
confined to patients with HF secondary to CAD.71
Most trials also demonstrated worse quality of life in patients
with T2DM and concurrent HF (both HFrEF and HFpEF), as
compared to patients without T2DM.40,
69 Patients with T2DM and
HFrEF also have shorter 6-minute walk distances and decreased
peak oxygen uptake in comparison to non-diabetics.55,

regional differences were reported across Europe, and no

HFrEF
and

was
performed
(Table 4).26,
29,
51,
73–81 In Sweden, there was a moderately higher
risk (HR 1.60)53 and in the Netherlands a significantly higher
risk of death (HR 3.19)26 attributed to T2DM. Additionally, in
the Rotterdam study, T2DM was associated with an excess risk
for CV death (HR 3.25) that was similar to the risk of all-cause
mortality.26 Likewise, all studies of the effect of T2DM on mortality
in HF outpatients have found a higher mortality risk attributable
to T2DM (Table 4).
Concerning patients hospitalized for HF, data on the associa-
tion between T2DM and in-hospital mortality are divergent. In
the OPTIMIZE-HF, ADHERE and Get With the Guidelines-HF reg-
istries in the United States, T2DM was not associated with higher
in-hospital mortality.82–85 Conversely, in the ALARM registry (six
European countries, Mexico and Australia), and in the Euro-
pean Society of Cardiology (ESC) HF Long-Term Registry, T2DM
was independently associated with a higher risk of in-hospital
mortality.51,
86 There is a suggestion from some cohorts82,
87 that
short-term mortality in HF patients post-discharge may be similar
or slightly lower in those with T2DM. However, with longer-term
follow-up, an association between T2DM and worse outcomes in
HF patients becomes evident. For example, in the EVEREST trial in
which patients were followed for 9.9 months after a HF hospitaliza-
tion, T2DM conferred a slightly higher mortality.45 Also, in patients
from Scotland, T2DM increased mid-to-long-term mortality fol-
lowing hospitalization for HF.87 Likewise, in the ESC HF Long-Term
Registry, the presence of T2DM was independently associated with
increased 1-year all-cause mortality.51,
73
Clinical trial results are somewhat conflicting regarding the
risk of all-cause and CV mortality attributed to T2DM in
HF patients, but most clinical trials reported an increased
risk of death in patients with concurrent T2DM and HF
(Table 5).1,
31–35,
37,
40,
42,
44,
45,
69,
88–92 In HFrEF, five out of eight
trials demonstrated an association between T2DM and increased
all-cause mortality, with the reported HRs between 1.3 and 2.0
(mostly around 1.5) (Table 5). Also three HFrEF trials reported
increased CV death, with HRs between 1.5 and 1.8.1,
31,
33 Con-
cerning HFpEF, all trials reported increased all-cause mortality
(HRs 1.5 to 1.8) and two out of four trials also reported an
increased risk of CV mortality in patients with T2DM compared
to patients without T2DM, with HRs 1.6 to 1.9 (Table 5). In the
CHARM trial, T2DM was an independent risk factor for both
all-cause mortality and CV mortality even after adjustment for 32
covariates.1 Additionally, in the same study, T2DM had a greater
association with higher all-cause and CV mortality in patients with
HFpEF than HFrEF.1
A recent meta-analysis of 31 registries and 12 clinical trials
with 381 725 patients with acute and chronic HF, with a median
follow-up of 3 years confirms that T2DM is independently associ-
ated with a higher risk of all-cause death (random-effects HR 1.28),
CV death (HR 1.34), hospitalization (HR 1.35), and the combined
endpoint of all-cause death or hospitalization (HR 1.41), and the
observed long-term risk appears greater in patients with chronic
than in those with acute HF.93

T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus and causes
of death in patients with heart failure
In the CHARM trial, patients with T2DM and both HFrEF and
HFpEF were more likely to die of all subtypes of CV death
[i.e. death due to HF, sudden cardiac death (SCD), death
due to MI and death due to stroke].1 The PARADIGM-HF
study also reported that patients with T2DM and HFrEF
were more likely to die of CV as well as all-cause mortality
compared with patients without T2DM.69 In the BEST trial,
T2DM was an independent risk factor for death from pump
failure.94
Aside from CV death, results from the Emerging Risk Factors
Collaboration, including 820 900 people, demonstrate that T2DM
is independently associated with increased risk of death from sev-
eral cancers (i.e. liver, pancreas, ovary, colorectum, lung, bladder,
and breast), renal and liver disease, pneumonia and other infec-
tious diseases, mental and nervous system disorders, non-hepatic
digestive diseases, external causes, and chronic obstructive pul-
monary disease.95 The study found that a 50-year-old with T2DM
died, on average, 6 years earlier than an individual without T2DM,
with about 40% of the difference in survival attributable to excess
non-vascular deaths.95

Is the higher risk of type 2 diabetes
mellitus only seen in heart failure
secondary to coronary artery disease?
Whether or not the increased risk of mortality with T2DM in HF
patients is seen in both those of ischaemic and non-ischaemic aeti-
ology is uncertain. The majority of the available data suggests that
T2DM is associated with higher risk of mortality in both patients
of ischaemic and non-ischaemic aetiology (Table 6).29,
88,
94,
96–99 In
a population-based Danish study, which followed patients for 6.8
years, patients with T2DM and HF had higher mortality whether
or not they had CAD.96 The higher risk appeared early and per-
sisted throughout follow-up. In the CHARM trial, patients with
both HFrEF and HFpEF had higher mortality attributed to T2DM
whether or not they had CAD.1 In the DIAMOND trial, T2DM
was associated with a higher risk of mortality in both ischaemic
and non-ischaemic HF.100 These consistent findings conflict with
two smaller population-based studies in the United States29 and
France97 and one Spanish single-centre study101 of patients hospi-
talized with HF, which suggested that diabetes was only associated
with higher mortality in those with non-ischaemic aetiology. In
three early clinical trials (SOLVD,98 BEST,94 and DIG102) the risk
appeared to be confined to those with an ischaemic aetiology.

Is the higher risk of mortality with type 2
diabetes mellitus and heart failure seen
in both women and men?
An early report from the Framingham study reported that the
mortality risk related to T2DM was confined to women and not
to men.103 In two population-based studies from Scotland and
Sweden, the increased mortality risk of T2DM was seen in both
women and men, but the effect was slightly greater in women.87,
96
Likewise, in the recent ESC HF Long-Term Registry and in the
CHARM trial, T2DM was a risk factor for mortality in both men
and women.1,
73
Does glycated haemoglobin predict
mortality in patients with heart failure
and type 2 diabetes mellitus?
In the CHARM trial, high HbA1c was associated with increased
all-cause and CV mortality in patients with T2DM and both HFrEF
and HFpEF.104 A 1% increase in HbA1c was associated with an
increased HR of 1.1 for CV mortality.104 In patients from a US study
of HF clinics, a U-shaped relationship with regard to increased
all-cause mortality was found.71 Patients with either very low

or very high HbA1c were at greatest risk. A similar U-shaped
curve was found in a single-centre study from Scotland.105 In
one single-centre observational study of 123 young patients with
advanced HF and T2DM, patients with a HbA1c of <7% had higher
rates of all-cause mortality.106 In the GISSI-HF study, including 6935
chronic HF patients, the presence of T2DM and higher HbA1c levels
was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (HRs 1.43 and
1.21, respectively) and the composite outcome of mortality and
CV hospitalization (HRs 1.21 and 1.14, respectively).107
In summary, high HbA1c levels in T2DM and HF are consistently
associated with higher mortality. Conversely, low HbA1c levels
can be associated with good outcomes (at least in a clinical
trial cohort), but can be associated with worse outcomes (in
population-based studies and those with very advanced HF).
Pre-diabetes and undiagnosed type 2
diabetes mellitus and risk of mortality
in heart failure
In the PARADIGM-HF trial, patients with pre-diabetes were at
increased risk of mortality.69 Patients with undiagnosed T2DM
were also at higher risk of mortality than subjects without T2DM,
but the risk was not as high as in patients with previously known

T2DM. In CHARM, pre-diabetes and undiagnosed T2DM were
both associated with greater rates of HF hospitalization, CV and
all-cause mortality than those without T2DM.108 However, not all
studies have reported an increased mortality risk with pre-diabetes.
In a study of 970 non-diabetic patients with HF, an increased
1-year mortality risk was found only in patients with HbA1c >6.7%
and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (≤45%), but not in
those with HFpEF.109 Also, in the GISSI-HF study of unselected
HF patients, pre-diabetes was not an independent predictor of
increased mortality.107 The reasons behind these discrepancies
might be attributed to differences in patient characteristics and
warrant further assessment.
T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus and risk
for heart failure hospitalization
Several clinical trials documented that patients with T2DM
and HFrEF were more likely than patients without T2DM to
be hospitalized for HF.1,

those with HFpEF than HFrEF and patients with HFpEF and T2DM
were almost 2.5 times more likely to be hospitalized for HF than
those without T2DM.1 In I-Preserve, patients with T2DM and
HFpEF were also more likely to be hospitalized with HF.40
Readmission after a hospitalization
for heart failure
Registry data indicate that patients with T2DM had more
all-cause rehospitalizations than those without T2DM.79,
82,
110
In a population-based study in Scotland, T2DM was a predictor of
readmission for HF (with the increased risk greatest in younger
women).87 In the ESC HF Long-Term Registry, T2DM was inde-
pendently associated with rehospitalization for HF.51 Likewise, in
the EVEREST trial, T2DM was associated with greater rates of HF
rehospitalization (HR 1.19).45
In addition, as demonstrate by the OPTIMIZE-HF and Get With
The Guidelines-HF registries in the United States, patients with HF
and T2DM experience slightly longer hospitalizations than patients
without T2DM.82–84

T
ype 2 diabetes mellitus, myocardial
infarction and stroke in patients
with heart failure
The only trial to investigate the association between T2DM and
risk of MI and stroke in HF patients was the CHARM trial
demonstrating that the presence of T2DM increased the risk for MI
and stroke irrespective of HF phenotype (i.e. HFrEF or HFpEF).1
Risk for heart failure hospitalization
in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
without a previous history of heart failure
In the ARIC registry, representing a cohort of 14 079 people in the
community without known HF, T2DM was the most powerful risk
factor for incident HF hospitalization.110 In a large meta-analysis
of patients with T2DM but without HF, predictors of incident HF
included insulin use, HbA1c and fasting glucose.111
Mortality in type 2 diabetes mellitus
patients with heart failure
In the CV outcomes trials of new therapies for T2DM, the
development of HF is associated with markedly higher mortality
(especially in RECORD112 and SAVOR-TIMI 5316). Patients with
T2DM who developed HF had a 10 to 12 times greater mortality
than those who did not develop HF.3,
113 In addition, they are also at
a 2.45-fold greater risk of CV death compared with patients with
T2DM but without HF.114
Unrecognized heart failure in patients
with type 2 diabetes mellitus
and unrecognized type 2 diabetes
mellitus in patients with heart failure
Observational evidence indicates that a significant proportion
of patients aged ≥60 years (27.7%) may have unrecognized HF
(22.9% and 4.8%, HFpEF and HFrEF, respectively) based on the
ESC diagnostic criteria.115,
116 On the other hand, pre-diabetes
and undiagnosed T2DM are common in patients with HF. In
the PARADIGM-HF trial, 13% of patients with HFrEF had undi-
agnosed T2DM and 25% had pre-diabetes.69 Likewise, 11% of
‘
non-T2DM’patients with HFrEF in the RESOLVD trial had undi-
agnosed T2DM.117 In the CHARM study, undiagnosed T2DM was
common in both HFrEF and HFpEF.108 In the ESC HF Long-Term
Registry, even higher proportion of HF patients (19.1%) had undi-
agnosed T2DM.73
Considering prognostic implications of concurrent T2DM and
HF, these findings stress the importance of developing screening
strategies for unrecognized HF among T2DM patients and vice
versa. Since evidence of strategies for HF screening is sparse,116
in T2DM patients, screening for HF might be currently based on
clinical characteristics (i.e. age, history of CAD, exercise-related
shortness of breath, body mass index, laterally displaced apex beat)
that have been shown to reliably identify elderly subjects at risk of

HF that may require further assessment (e.g. echocardiography).118
Such a strategy may be used to prevent complications and pos-
sibly improve outcomes, particularly in subjects with HFrEF.119
Conversely, since undiagnosed T2DM is common among patients
with HF, it is prudent to screen patients without known T2DM
in accordance with current recommendations using the 8 h fasting
plasma glucose, 2 h glucose tolerance test or HbA1c levels (equally
appropriate).120
Pathophysiological aspects
of myocardial dysfunction in type
2 diabetes mellitus
The most common co-existing conditions that cause HF in
patients with T2DM are CAD and hypertension. It has also been
hypothesized that T2DM-related processes can cause HF by
directly affecting the structure and function of the heart.4 The
major drivers of myocardial dysfunction in T2DM are insulin
resistance/hyperinsulinaemia
and
impaired
glucose
tolerance,
which may be effective years or even decades before overt
T2DM develops.121 Their detrimental effect is associated with
numerous metabolic abnormalities such as advanced glycosylation
end products (AGEs) deposition, lipotoxicity and microvascular
rarefication.4 Harmful interrelations between these pathophysio-
logic mechanisms may exert a potentiating effect, leading to several
maladaptive responses and resulting in myocyte alteration.4 Insulin
resistance leads to increased free fatty acid release and is linked
with HF-related neuroendocrine dysregulation.122 It is also an
important aetiological factor in the development of left ventricular
hypertrophy,123 as confirmed in the Framingham study, where left
ventricular mass was significantly higher in female patients with
T2DM compared to patients without T2DM.124 Hyperglycaemia
also exerts extensive influences on CV changes in T2DM, and can
directly cause cardiomyocyte contractile dysfunction, mitochon-
drial network fragmentation and an increase in protein kinase C
activity.125–127 Also, it causes activation of reactive oxygen species
and the deposition of AGEs in both endothelial and smooth muscle
cells, which predisposes to concentric left ventricular remodelling
and raises left ventricular diastolic stiffness.125,
126 High myocardial
free fatty acid uptake results in the accumulation of triglyceride in
the myocardium (i.e. lipotoxicity). Cardiac steatosis, confirmed by
proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, is the clinical equivalent
of high myocardial triglyceride content and may present as left
ventricular diastolic dysfunction.128
Diabetic cardiomyopathy
In 1954, Lundbaek was the first to propose the existence of a
specific diabetic heart muscle disease without involvement of CAD
or hypertension.129 Two decades later, Rubler et al.130 described
diabetic-related post-mortem findings in four patients with T2DM,
glomerulosclerosis and HFrEF with normal epicardial coronary
arteries. There is no definition of diabetic cardiomyopathy, which
makes studies of epidemiology, pathophysiology, natural history
and associated clinical outcomes challenging. The most commonly

accepted definition refers to a myocardial dysfunction which occurs
in the absence of all other CV disease.120,
131
Phenotypes of type 2 diabetes
mellitus-related cardiomyopathy
Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction and heart failure
with preserved ejection fraction in type 2 diabetes
mellitus
Left ventricular diastolic dysfunction can be detected in 75% of
T2DM patients and develops early in T2DM course, as confirmed
by demographic characteristics of these patients, including younger
age, normal blood pressure and optimal T2DM control.132,
133
Furthermore, the degree of glucose dysregulation correlates with
left ventricular diastolic dysfunction severity,134 and with increased
risk of incident HF and CV mortality in T2DM.135–137 Almost half
of HF patients with T2DM have HFpEF, which is more frequent in
older, hypertensive and female patients with T2DM and is difficult
to diagnose because the symptoms are often mild, appear upon
physical activity, and could be frequently misdiagnosed as chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.89
HFpEF is usually associated with mild T2DM complications in
the early stages of T2DM, whilst HFrEF is associated with more
severe T2DM complications.138 This suggests that severity and
duration of hyperglycaemia are important for the development of
left ventricular dysfunction.
Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction in type 2
diabetes mellitus
The major cause of HFrEF in T2DM is CAD. T2DM is associated
with a two-fold higher risk of CAD and ischaemic stroke, and a
two- to four-fold higher CAD- and stroke-related mortality.139–141
CAD in T2DM is usually diffuse, multi-vessel and may lead to
silent MI.
Treatment of heart failure
in patients with type 2 diabetes
mellitus
There are no specific constraints to HF treatment in T2DM
patients as recommended by the 2016 ESC guidelines for the man-
agement of HF.116 In clinical trials, all pharmacological and device
therapies for HF were similarly effective whether or not patients
had T2DM. Thus far, there were no clinical trials of HF treatment
that included only patients with T2DM, and available evidence is
derived from subanalyses of mixed populations. However, several
HF drugs may exert metabolic effects that should be taken into
account in T2DM patients.
Pharmacological therapy
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
The ESC/EASD guidelines on diabetes, pre-diabetes, and CV dis-
eases recommend angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
in patients with HFrEF and T2DM, as they have been shown to
improve symptoms and reduce morbidity and mortality.116 The
effectiveness of ACE-inhibitors in patients with both T2DM and HF,
or post-MI left ventricular systolic dysfunction was examined in a
large meta-analysis of seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs).142
For the endpoint of all-cause mortality, ACE-inhibitors had a simi-
lar treatment benefit in subjects with and without T2DM (HR 0.84
and 0.85, respectively).
The only large ACE-inhibitor trial in HFrEF to provide detailed
information on patients with T2DM was the ATLAS, which com-
pared low-dose (2.5–5.0 mg daily) to high-dose (32.5–35.0 mg
daily) lisinopril.143,
144 The greater relative benefit for the compos-
ite primary endpoint (all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization)
of high-dose lisinopril was similar in patients with and without
T2DM. However, because patients with T2DM were at greater
risk, the absolute benefit of high-dose lisinopril was larger in
patients with T2DM.144 The occurrence of adverse effects with
high-dose lisinopril was similar in those with and without T2DM
with respect to hypotension/dizziness (35% vs. 32%), renal dysfunc-
tion/hyperkalaemia (29% vs. 22%) and cough (12% vs. 10%).144
Angiotensin receptor blockers
In the CHARM trial, a significant reduction in CV death, HF hos-
pitalization and all-cause mortality was achieved with candesartan
in patients with HF and HFrEF, irrespectively of T2DM.1 Also, in
the Val-HeFT, valsartan treatment led to a significant relative risk
reduction in the co-primary composite endpoint (death or HF
morbidity—mainly HF hospitalization) regardless of T2DM.145 A
subsequent trial (HEAAL146) showed that 150 mg daily of losartan
was superior to 50 mg daily in reducing the risk of death or HF
hospitalization, supporting the similar findings of the ATLAS trial
with the ACE-inhibitor lisinopril. The treatment effect was again
not different in the subgroup of patients with T2DM compared to
those without T2DM (HR 0.96; interaction P=0.35).
There is little information about the tolerability of angiotensin
receptor blockers (ARBs) in T2DM. In the overall CHARM pro-
gram, patients with T2DM had double the risk of developing hyper-
kalaemia on candesartan compared to those without T2DM.147
T2DM confers a higher risk of diabetic nephropathy and chronic
kidney disease.148 Specifically, diabetic nephropathy is character-
ized by increased renal sodium retention149,
150 and a higher risk
of hyperkalaemia.151 This caveat deserves consideration when
ACE-inhibitors or ARBs are administered to diabetic patients, as
these drugs may interfere with renal potassium excretion. Hence,
monitoring of serum electrolytes and creatinine is recommended
when starting or escalating the dose of ACE-inhibitors or ARBs.
Beta-blockers
Subgroup analyses of large HF trials show that beta-blockers reduce
mortality and hospitalization and improve symptoms in moder-
ate to severe HF, irrespectively of T2DM.37,
152,
153 Beta-blockers
recommended in HF and T2DM include metoprolol succinate
(MERIT-HF),37 bisoprolol (CIBIS II)152 and carvedilol (COPERNI-
CUS and COMET).154,
155 The MERIT-HF trial reported similar
efficacy and safety of metoprolol succinate in patients with and

without T2DM.37 Adverse events were more often observed in
T2DM patients, but were less likely to occur if those patients
were treated with metoprolol succinate than with placebo. In a
meta-analysis of six trials, beta-blocker therapy reduced all-cause
mortality in patients with T2DM (HR 0.84) similarly to those
without T2DM (HR 0.72).156 An analysis of three trials (CIBIS II,
MERIT-HF and COPERNICUS) reported a relative risk reduction
for mortality of 0.77 in patients with T2DM and 0.65 in patients
without T2DM.142 A third meta-analysis that focused on seven
trials using carvedilol, including a post-MI trial, revealed a simi-
lar, significant reduction in the risk for mortality with carvedilol
in patients with and without T2DM (28% and 37%, respectively,
interaction P=0.25).157
Hypoglycaemia is a concern in patients with T2DM treated
with insulin or sulfonylureas. Theoretically, beta-blockers could
alter awareness of hypoglycaemia by decreasing palpitations and
tremor and prolong recovery from hypoglycaemia by blocking 𝛽2
receptors, which partly control glucose production in the liver.
However, among patients with T2DM in MERIT-HF only three
(0.6%) in the placebo group and four (0.8%) in the metoprolol
succinate group had an adverse event related to hypoglycaemia (in
each case in patients taking insulin).37
In summary, beta-blockers in patients with T2DM and HF lead to
significant improvements in morbidity and mortality that are con-
sistent with results in patients without T2DM. These treatment
benefits of beta-blockers in diabetic patients far outweigh the the-
oretical risks related to hypoglycaemia and minor changes in HbA1c
and serum lipids. These benefits strongly support beta-blocker
treatment in patients with concurrent T2DM and HF.
Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists
The mortality benefit of spironolactone in the RALES trial and
eplerenone in the EMPHASIS-HF trial was consistent in T2DM
and non-T2DM patients with HFrEF.158,
159 Importantly, eplerenone
seems to have no effect on new-onset T2DM in patients with
HF, suggesting a neutral metabolic profile.160 Caution is necessary
when these medications are used in patients with impaired renal
function and in those with serum potassium levels of ≥5.0 mmol/L.
Monitoring of kidney function and potassium is mandatory since
nephropathy is frequent in T2DM. Addition of an ARB (or renin
inhibitor) to a combination of ACE-inhibitor and mineralocorticoid
receptor antagonists is prohibited because of the increased risk
of renal dysfunction and hyperkalaemia and the lack of additional
benefit.161
Sacubitril/valsartan
In the PARADIGM-HF trial, sacubitril/valsartan was superior to the
ACE-inhibitor enalapril in reducing the risks of death and HF hos-
pitalization (primary endpoint) in patients with HFrEF.31 A T2DM
subgroup analysis has shown that the effect of sacubitril/valsartan
compared with enalapril for the primary endpoint was similar in
patients with and without T2DM (HR 0.83 and 0.77; respectively,
interaction P=0.40).69 In the post hoc analysis, treatment with sacu-
bitril/valsartan was associated with a greater HbA1c reduction and

a lower rate of initiation of insulin or other drugs for T2DM com-
pared to enalapril.162
Nitrates and hydralazine
The A-HeFT trial examined the efficacy for the reduction in
all-cause mortality, hospitalization and quality of life of a fixed dose
combination of isosorbide dinitrate and hydralazine hydrochloride
in African Americans with HF.163 A very large proportion (41%) of
patients in the study had T2DM. The treatment effect on mortality
was similar in patients with and without T2DM (HRs 0.56 and 0.59,
respectively).
Ivabradine
In a large trial involving 6558 patients with HF (30% with T2DM),
ivabradine demonstrated a significant reduction in the composite
endpoint of CV death or HF hospitalization, with no difference
between T2DM and non-T2DM patients (HRs 0.81 and 0.83,
respectively).164
Diuretics
Diuretics are usually required to treat the symptoms and signs
of fluid overload in patients with HF. There are no clinical trials
examining their efficacy in patients with both T2DM and HF. The-
oretically thiazide diuretics can lead to increased insulin resistance
and subsequent worsening of glycaemic control.
Devices and surgery
Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators
In addition to a higher risk of death due to worsening HF, patients
with T2DM and HF are at increased risk of malignant ventricular
arrhythmias and SCD. In the CHARM trial, patients with T2DM
experienced a significantly higher rate of SCD compared to patients
without T2DM (40 vs. 25.9 events/1000 patient-years of follow-up),
and the increased risk of SCD was observed irrespective of
HF phenotype (i.e. HFrEF and HFpEF).1 Observational data also
demonstrate an increased risk of SCD in the presence of T2DM
in HF of both ischaemic and non-ischaemic aetiology.75 Device
therapies, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and cardiac
resynchronization therapy with ICD (CRT-D) offer a possibility
to reduce overall mortality with effective prevention of SCD, and
data from clinical trials support this notion in patients with and
without T2DM.
The SCD-HeFT trial included patients with both non-ischaemic
and ischaemic HFrEF who were randomized to placebo, amio-
darone, or an ICD.165 The study included approximately 30% of
patients with T2DM in every treatment arm. ICD treatment led to
a significant relative risk reduction in death and in subgroup analysis,
there were no interactions with T2DM. The HRs for the primary
endpoint of all-cause mortality in the ICD group were 0.95 for
patients with T2DM and 0.67 for those without T2DM and in the
amiodarone group 1.2 for patients with T2DM, and 1.0 for those
without T2DM. In the DANISH trial, patients with non-ischaemic
cardiomyopathies were randomized to ICD and optimal medical

therapy or optimal medical therapy alone.166 Approximately 19%
of patients had T2DM. In pre-specified subgroup analysis, there
was no significant difference in treatment effect in patients with
and without T2DM (HRs 0.92 and 0.85, respectively, interaction
P=0.60).
Cardiac resynchronization therapy
The effectiveness of CRT to reduce the risk of all-cause death
and HF hospitalization was evaluated in two clinical trials
(COMPANION167 and CARE-HF168) that randomized patients
with moderate to severely symptomatic HF (NYHA class III or
IV) to either optimal medical therapy or optimal medical therapy
plus CRT. Additionally, two trials (MADIT-CRT169 and RAFT170),
randomized patients with mild to moderate HF symptoms to
optimal medical therapy plus ICD, or optimal medical therapy plus
CRT-D, for the primary endpoint (death or HF hospitalization).
In relation to T2DM status, both COMPANION (41% of T2DM
patients), and CARE-HF (29% of T2DM patients) demonstrated
similar effectiveness of CRT for the reduction in mortality and HF
hospitalization.171,
172
In MADIT-CRT, CRT-D treatment, compared with optimal med-
ical therapy plus ICD, led to a similar reduction in the risk of
all-cause death or HF hospitalization in patients with and without
T2DM (adjusted HRs 0.56 and 0.67, respectively).169,
173 Also, sub-
group analysis of the RAFT trial showed that the benefit of CRT-D
was similar in patients with and without T2DM.170 Patients with
T2DM did not experience a higher rate of complications related
to device implantation, including infection.170 There were similar
CRT-related improvements in left ventricular volumes and ejection
fraction in those with and without T2DM.
Coronary artery bypass grafting
Coronary artery disease is the leading cause of premature mor-
tality in patients with T2DM, which stresses the importance of an
early detection (e.g. stress echocardiography, coronary angiogra-
phy) based on the estimated CV risk, and a timely treatment of
CAD.174,
175
The STICH trial addressed the broader role of surgical revascu-
larization in patients with HFrEF and less severe CAD.176 Patients
suitable for surgery were randomized to coronary artery bypass
graft (CABG) plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone. In the
subanalysis of the STICH trial, there was no significant difference
between patients with (40%) and without T2DM with respect to
the primary outcome of all-cause mortality.177 This trial therefore
extends the indication for CABG to ‘
STICH-like’patients with two-
or three-vessel CAD, including a left anterior descending stenosis,
who are otherwise suitable for surgery. The benefits are similar
whether or not a patient has T2DM.
Cardiac transplantation
Cardiac transplantation in T2DM with macrovascular complica-
tions and end-stage HF may impose several challenging issues,
including renal dysfunction, peripheral vascular disease, increased

risk of infection and the need for prednisolone-based immuno-
suppression. T2DM was an independent risk factor for reduced
10-year survival in a large registry of 22 385 transplant patients.178
However, with modern immunosuppression regimens allowing
more rapid tapering of steroid doses and steroid-free immunosup-
pression, cardiac transplantation in T2DM (in the absence of major
T2DM complications) should be considered on a case-by-case
basis.
Exercise prescription
Recently, a single large trial (HF-ACTION34) investigated the effects
of exercise training in patients with mild to moderately severe HF
symptoms. In an adjusted analysis, exercise training led to an 11%
(P=0.03) reduction in the primary composite outcome of all-cause
mortality or all-cause hospitalization. The trial enrolled 32% of
patients with T2DM and there was no interaction between T2DM
status and the effect of exercise on clinical outcomes.
Type 2 antidiabetic drugs and the
risk of heart failure
Drugs that increase heart failure
hospitalizations
Over the last 15 years there has been concern that some of
T2DM drugs might increase the risk for HF (Table 7).16,
17,
179–182
Drugs that are now known to increase the risk for HF are
thiazolidinediones (TZDs) and a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4)
inhibitor, saxagliptin.16,
17 In the RECORD112 and the PROactive
trials,183 patients randomized to TZDs, rosiglitazone and piogli-
tazone, respectively, had more HF events than those on placebo.
In the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial (saxagliptin vs. placebo), saxagliptin
significantly increased the risk for HF hospitalizations (HR 1.27,
P=0.007).16 Patients at greatest risk were those with a history of
HF, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≤60 mL/min,
or elevated baseline levels of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic
peptide (NT-proBNP).16 In both RECORD and SAVOR-TIMI trials,
patients who developed HF had a high rate of subsequent death.
On that basis, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone and saxagliptin are con-
traindicated in patients with HF or at risk of HF.
Not all DPP4 inhibitors are associated with higher rates of
HF (Table 8).16–24,
184–186 In the EXAMINE trial of alogliptin vs.
placebo in patients who had had an acute coronary syndrome,
there was not a statistically significant increase in the risk of HF
hospitalizations in patients randomized to alogliptin.19,
184 Likewise,
sitagliptin in the TECOS trial had no signal of excess rates of
HF.18,
185 Two ongoing trials, CAROLINA (Cardiovascular Outcome
Study of Linagliptin Versus Glimepiride in Patients With Type 2
Diabetes; NCT01243424), and CARMELINA (Cardiovascular and
Renal Microvascular Outcome Study With Linagliptin in Patients
with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; NCT01897532), will allow further
clarification on the role DPP4 inhibitors in patients with T2DM
and HF.

Drugs that might increase the risk
for heart failure
Over many years there has been suspicion that insulin, which
causes sodium and water retention, may increase the risk for the
development of HF. In large observational studies, insulin is asso-
ciated with higher mortality rates than metformin.2 There have
been similar concerns with sulphonylureas which, as insulin sec-
retagogues, have also been associated with higher death rates than
metformin.2 These studies, although large, are non-randomized
and therefore inconclusive. In the only RCT of insulin vs. placebo
[ORIGIN, 12 537 people with CV risk factors plus impaired fast-
ing glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or T2DM (i.e. not in
patients with HF)], insulin was not associated with higher rates
of HF hospitalization than placebo.187 Remarkably, despite the use
of insulin and sulphonylureas for decades, there are no other
placebo-controlled randomized trials.

Currently, sulphonylureas and insulin could be used in T2DM
patients with HF (usually as a second- or third-line treatment),
although their safety in HF is still inconclusive.
Antidiabetic drugs that might be safe
in heart failure
It has been proposed that metformin might be safe and efficacious
in patients with T2DM and HF. This was based on large observa-
tional studies where metformin was associated with lower mortal-
ity and HF hospitalization rates than other T2DM drugs (primarily
insulin and sulphonylureas).2 There are no RCTs of metformin in
patients with T2DM and HF. Whether or not metformin is effica-
cious or safe is inconclusive. Previous concerns that metformin may
cause metabolic acidosis are no longer justified.2 Accordingly, met-
formin could be recommended as first-line treatment for patients
with T2DM and HF who have preserved or moderately reduced
renal function (i.e. eGFR >30 mL/min).
Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have been
the subject of many large placebo-controlled trials in patients
with T2DM and CV disease or at high risk of CV disease
(Table 8).22–24,
186 In these trials, GLP-1 receptor agonists had a
neutral effect on the risk for HF hospitalization. Similarly, no signal
for a higher risk for HF hospitalization was seen with acarbose (vs.
placebo) in patients with insulin resistance and CAD.188 Bromocrip-
tine has not been studied with respect to its effect on HF outcomes.
Prevention of heart failure by type 2
antidiabetic drugs
A significant breakthrough in contemporary cardiology was the
finding that some T2DM drugs are associated with a lower risk
of HF hospitalization in patients with CV disease or at high risk
of CV disease (Table 8). Two large RCTs that assessed CV safety
of the sodium–glucose co-transporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors,
empagliflozin and canagliflozin, have shown a significant reduction
in HF hospitalization with both drugs.20,
189 The primary outcome
in both trials was the three-point major adverse CV event (i.e. CV
death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke) and HF hospitalization was a
secondary outcome. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (n=7020),
including patients with T2DM, established CV disease and eGFR
>30 mL/min/1.73 m2, there was a major reduction in HF hospital-
ization (HR 0.65) with empagliflozin compared with placebo.20 The
observed beneficial effect of empagliflozin became evident early
(i.e. 2–3 months of treatment) and was observed across a range of
pre-specified subgroups, including patients with (10%) and without
investigator-reported HF at baseline, that had a similar reduction in
HF hospitalizations with empagliflozin compared with placebo. No
echocardiograms or natriuretic peptide measurements are avail-
able from this trial, so the detail of the beneficial effect on HF
hospitalization is not available. Patients hospitalized for HF dur-
ing the study had a high mortality, which was lower in patients
receiving empagliflozin than placebo (13.5% vs. 24.2%).20 In the
CANVAS trial, patients with T2DM (n=10 143) either with estab-
lished CV disease or at high risk of CV disease, randomized to

canagliflozin or placebo had a significantly lower risk of HF hospi-
talization (HR 0.67).21,
189 Empagliflozin in EMPA-REG OUTCOME,
but not canagliflozin in CANVAS, reduced all-cause and CV mor-
tality as well as HF hospitalization. In the EMPA-REG OUTCOME
trial, the only major adverse event was an increased risk of genital
tract infections, which were treatable, and infrequently recurred.20
In the CANVAS trial, treatment with canagliflozin was associated
with a significantly higher risk of lower-limb amputations (6.3 vs. 3.4
per 1000 patient-years; HR 1.97) and possibly a higher risk of frac-
tures compared with placebo.21 Large RCTs of other new T2DM
drugs have not shown a reduction in incident HF (Table 8).
Treatment of heart failure
with type 2 antidiabetic drugs
Randomized clinical trials with SGLT2
inhibitors
While two drugs (i.e. empagliflozin and canagliflozin) have a
favourable effect on HF hospitalization, no T2DM drug has yet
been investigated as a treatment for HF. In 2017, three large
RCTs with SGLT2 inhibitors (i.e. empagliflozin and dapagliflozin)
have started, which will enrol HF patients either with or with-
out T2DM (i.e. T2DM is not a mandatory inclusion criteria).
Two trials will assess safety and efficacy of empagliflozin vs.
placebo on top of guideline-based medical therapy for the reduc-
tion in primary outcome (CV death or HF hospitalization) both
in patients with HFrEF (EMPEROR-Reduced, NCT03057977) and
HFpEF (EMPEROR-Preserved, NCT03057951) (Table 9). Among
secondary outcomes, the two trials will assess all-cause mortal-
ity, and renal effects of empagliflozin vs. placebo in patients with
HF. The third trial (Dapa-HF, NCT03036124) will assess safety and
efficacy of dapagliflozin vs. placebo for the reduction in CV death
or HF hospitalization (or urgent HF visit) in patients with HFrEF.
Secondary outcomes will include all-cause mortality and effects on

renal function. The results of these trials will shed more light on
potential beneficial CV and renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in HF
patients, including those without T2DM.
In addition, a number of ongoing smaller RCTs are assessing
the effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on CV outcomes, including various
aspects of HF in patients with and without T2DM, as summarized
in Table 9.
Randomized clinical trials with GLP-1
receptor agonists
In the LIVE trial, in patients with stable HFrEF, with and with-
out T2DM, there were no significant changes in left ventric-
ular ejection fraction between patients randomized on liraglu-
tide or placebo.180 However, there was a significant increase in
heart rate (P<0.0001) and more serious cardiac adverse events
with liraglutide (P=0.04). In a placebo-controlled FIGHT trial, of
patients with HFrEF, with and without T2DM (41%), liraglutide
was not associated with an improvement in the composite primary
endpoint of death, rehospitalization and NT-proBNP change.181
Pre-specified subgroup analyses in patients with T2DM did not
reveal any significant between-group differences. A small random-
ized, placebo-controlled trial of albiglutide in HFrEF showed no
effect on left ventricular function and 6-minute walk distance.190
These observations have raised some concern regarding the safety
of liraglutide in HFrEF patients that warrants further research.
Conclusions
Type 2 diabetes mellitus and HF are both common and frequently
co-exist. The causes of HF in T2DM are numerous, but CAD
and hypertension are likely the most important contributors to
concurrent T2DM and HF, whereas a direct effect of T2DM on
the myocardium (e.g. ‘
diabetic cardiomyopathy’
) might also play a
role. Evidence from recent large-scale clinical trials and registries

PRESERVED-HF (NCT03030235)
Dapagliflozin Effect on Symptoms and Biomarkers in patients HFpEF
• Study population: HFpEF with T2DM or pre-diabetes.
• Estimated enrolment: n=320.
• Treatment: dapagliflozin vs. placebo.
• Primary outcome: change in plasma concentrations of NT-proBNP (time frame: baseline to week 6 and
12) as a measure of treatment impact on HF.
REFORM (NCT02397421)
Safety and Effectiveness of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Patients With Heart Failure and Diabetes
• Study population: HFrEF with T2DM.
• Estimated enrolment: n=56.
• Treatment: dapagliflozin vs. placebo.
• Primary outcome: changes in LV systolic and diastolic volumes in patients as determined by cardiac
magnetic resonance imaging.
CV, cardiovascular; HF, heart failure; HFpEF, heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; HFrEF, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; LV, left ventricular; MI, myocardial
infarction; NT-proBNP
, N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide; SGLT2, sodium–glucose co-transporter type 2; T2DM, type 2 diabetes mellitus.
indicates a significantly higher risk of adverse outcomes in patients
with HF and T2DM, including a higher risk for hospitalization and
rehospitalization for HF, as well as increased all-cause and CV mor-
tality, independent of HF aetiology or phenotype (i.e. HFrEF and
HFpEF). HF treatment with medications and devices (e.g. ICD,
CRT-D) is similarly effective in patients with and without T2DM.
There has been uncertainty about the safety of older T2DM drugs
such as insulin and sulphonlyureas in patients with T2DM and
HF but there are no RCTs to allow firm conclusions. In patients
with T2DM without HF, some drugs have been shown to increase
the risk of HF hospitalizations (i.e. rosiglitazone, pioglitazone and
saxagliptin) and, consequently, these medications are contraindi-
cated in patients T2DM with prior HF or at risk of HF. Large
clinical trials investigating CV safety of newer antidiabetic drugs in
patients with CV disease or at high CV risk have demonstrated
that GLP-1 receptor agonists and a DPP4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, have
a neutral effect on the risk of HF hospitalisations. In addition,
SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin demonstrated a
significant reduction in the risk of HF hospitalizations in patients
with T2DM. SGLT2 inhibitors are currently being investigated as a
potential addition to the optimal medical treatment of HF, not only
in patients with, but also in those without T2DM.
Conflict of interest: none declared.
