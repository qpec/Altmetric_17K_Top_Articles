 them to 8 different anatomic compartments in 6 human organ donors. We show that large B cell 
clones partition into two broad networks—one spans the blood, bone marrow, spleen and lung, 
while the other is restricted to tissues within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (jejunum, ileum and 
colon). Notably, GI tract clones display extensive sharing of sequence variants among different 
portions of the tract and have higher frequencies of somatic hypermutation, suggesting extensive 
and serial rounds of clonal expansion and selection. Our findings provide an anatomic atlas of B 
cell clonal lineages, their properties and tissue connections. This resource serves as a foundation 
for studies of tissue-based immunity, including vaccine responses, infections, autoimmunity and 
cancer.
B cells are key players in the generation of protective immunity.1 During an immune 
response, B cells recognize antigen through their B cell receptors (antibodies) and can 
receive T cell help in specialized tissue-based structures termed germinal centers.2 The 
antibody genes in activated B cells can undergo somatic hypermutation (SHM), generating 
antibody sequence variants within lineages of clonally-related B cells.3,4 Activated B cells 
can become memory B cells or differentiate to become antibody-secreting plasma cells.5 
Secreted antibodies contribute to the humoral immune response by neutralizing viruses and 
toxins, interacting with other immune cells via their constant regions and forming immune 
complexes that are processed by the reticuloendothelial system.6
B cells can combat infection locally, activating antigen-specific T cells and elaborating 
cytokines that influence nearby immune cells. The tissue distribution and trafficking of B 
cell clones influences how infections are controlled throughout the body. Animal studies 
indicate that tissue localization of B cells and plasma cells is important for protective 
immunity and homeostasis of bacterial microflora.7-9 However, unlike lab mice, humans are 
outbred, and live for decades in diverse environments with exposures to many different 
antigens and pathogens. Humans and mice also differ in the microanatomy of their tissues 
and in how their B cell subsets are defined.10,11 Tissue-based B cell subsets are not well 
understood in humans. Furthermore, most studies of human B cells have sampled the blood 
or tonsils. Consequently, how clones are localized to specific regions or tissues in the human 
body – as has been described for tissue resident T cells12,13 – is not known for B cells.
To understand how B cell clones are distributed in the human body, we performed next 
generation sequencing of antibody heavy chain gene rearrangements directly from the 
tissues. Because clonal lineages are somatically generated, the definition of clonal networks 
required the sampling and comparison of several different tissues from the same individual. 
Hence, VH rearrangements in 7 different tissues and blood were analyzed from 6 different 
human organ donors. After extensive sampling and clonal overlap analysis within the 
tissues, we identified the largest B cell clones that overlapped between the tissues. We 
mapped the tissue distribution of each large clone, creating an atlas of B cell clonal 
networks.

 RESULTS
Sequencing pipeline and clone size thresholding
Using our resource of human tissues obtained from organ donors12-14, DNA was extracted 
from blood, bone marrow, spleen, lung, mesenteric lymph node, jejunum, ileum and colon. 
Donor information is provided in Table 1. Samples were amplified and sequenced at high 
depth from two donors (D207 and D181) and at lower depth in four additional donors 
(D145, D149, D168 and D182) for confirmatory analyses. As different B cell subsets differ 
in their antibody RNA transcript levels, are not fully defined in human tissues and vary in 
their ease of recovery in single cell suspensions from tissues, we extracted DNA from whole 
tissue samples.15 The analysis of DNA permitted efficient (one template per cell), large-
scale, and agnostic sampling of all B cells. Antibody heavy chain gene rearrangements were 
amplified and sequenced (see Methods and Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Rearranged 
heavy chain VH regions were used to distinguish clonally related B cells from each other by 
virtue of the highly diverse junction between the V (variable), D (diversity) and J (joining) 
gene sequences, which comprises the third complementarity determining region 
(CDR3).16,17
We defined clonally related B cells as sharing the same VH and JH gene groups18, having 
the same CDR3 length and exhibiting at least 85% CDR3 amino acid identity.19 This 
sequence similarity threshold was low enough to combine clonally related sequences with 
somatic mutations together, while being high enough to limit too many unrelated sequences 
from being incorrectly combined into the same lineage.19,20 The definition used for clone 
size thresholding was the sum of the number of unique sequence variants weighted by the 
number of instances of each unique sequence in independent PCR amplifications (see 
Methods for detailed calculations). This hybrid definition (“unique sequence instances”) 
affords some correction for differences in sequencing depth (which can influence unique 
sequence numbers), while not relying exclusively on resampling to establish clone size cut-
offs. To assess the power of detection of clonal overlap, rarefaction analysis21 was 
performed on replicate sequencing libraries from each tissue (Supplementary Fig. 1a). 
Clones larger than 20 unique sequence instances (hereafter called C20 clones, see Methods) 
had at least a 75% chance of being resampled within most tissues (Supplementary Fig. 1b). 
D207 had 579,332 clones, of which 5,214 were C20 clones (see Methods and sequencing 
metadata in Table 2).
Clonal networks within and between tissues
Tissues differed in the diversity of their C20 clones (Fig. 1a). Of the tissues analyzed, the 
spleen had the highest level of internal similarity and the blood had the lowest internal 
similarity in replicate sequencing libraries from each tissue (Fig. 1b). These findings are 
consistent with blood having the highest sampled diversity. The high diversity observed in 
the blood may be due to the fact that the blood undergoes extensive mixing, unlike the 
tissues. The internal similarity tissue map in D181 differed from D207, but became more 
similar to D207 when the largest clones were removed (Supplementary Fig. 2a). D181 was 
noteworthy for having a very large clone that comprised 15% of total sequence copies in the 
lung that was also detected in the spleen (~5%), bone marrow (~2.5%) and blood (~1%).

 This massive clone, (ID 183,264 of the ImmuneDB database; Methods and http://
immunedb.com/tissue-atlas), had 218,000 copies in the entire body, including 4,265 unique 
sequence variants. In the blood, a clone of this size could be worrisome for malignancy or a 
pre-malignant condition such as monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis22. However, in the 
tissues, the levels of clonal expansion are not fully defined and may be influenced by 
regional localization of clones, including tissue resident cells, in the sampled tissue 
fragments.
Analysis of overlap between the tissues revealed two prominent networks of overlapping 
clones in both of the deeply sequenced donors (Fig. 1c). One network comprised the blood, 
bone marrow, lung and spleen and the other network consisted of the jejunum, ileum and 
colon. Clones in the mesenteric lymph node (MLN) spanned both the blood-rich sites and 
the GI tract, but exhibited greater overlap with the GI tract. When clones with sequences 
found in the blood were computationally removed, the network of overlapping clones within 
the blood-rich sites was more diminished than the GI tract network (Supplementary Fig. 2b). 
Regardless of the clone size definition used, blood and GI tract networks were observed 
(Supplementary Fig. 3). These data support the existence of two major networks of 
expanded B cell clones, one in blood-rich tissues and a separate network in the GI tract.
The preceding analysis focused on pairwise tissue comparisons. To evaluate the distribution 
of C20 clones across all of the tissues, C20 clones from D207 and D181 were classified into 
different tissue representation categories: global (found in 6-8 tissues), regional (3-5 tissues), 
two-tissue and single-tissue (Fig. 2, Supplementary Tables 3 and 4). Globally distributed 
clones tended to be the largest (Supplementary Fig. 4). Both the regional and two-tissue 
clones echoed the patterns of overlap observed in the paired tissue analysis: they were 
usually present in either the GI tract or the blood-rich tissues (Fig. 2). Supplementary Figs. 5 
and 6 show all C20 clonal distribution patterns in D207 and D181, confirming the existence 
of two distinct networks inferred from the pairwise comparisons. Blood and GI tract 
networks across all of the tissues were observed at different clone size cut-offs 
(Supplementary Fig. 7a) and at two different stringencies of clone collapsing 
(Supplementary Fig. 7b). Furthermore, the analysis of networks revealed similar blood and 
GI tract networks in all six donors (Supplementary Fig. 8). As with the two-tissue 
comparisons, computational removal of the clones with peripheral blood sequences had a 
more profound influence on the blood-rich than the GI tract tissue clonal networks 
(Supplementary Fig. 9 and 10).
Clonal lineage analysis
To gain further insight into how clones interconnected in different tissues, we performed 
clonal lineage analysis (see Methods and 23,24 for details on lineage construction). Clonal 
lineages tree structures are inferred by neighbor-joining based upon the different somatic 
mutations found in their unique sequence variants.23 Lineage trees can have trunks 
(consisting of somatic mutations that are shared amongst sequences) and branches and 
leaves (the latter consisting of mutations that are restricted to successively smaller subsets of 
the sequences in the tree). Clonally diversifying lineages within the blood-rich tissues have a 
branch structure in which the sequences from single tissues tend to all be located on single

 branches, as shown in Fig. 3a (left and center trees). In contrast, similar lineages in the GI 
tract have multiple tissues represented in each branch (Fig. 3a, right tree). Furthermore, the 
lineage tree nodes, which represent unique sequences, in such GI tract clones have 
contributions from multiple tissues (11 of 20 nodes in the right tree vs. 1 of 45 populated 
nodes in blood-rich trees, left and center). In order to quantitate the extent of dispersion of 
mutated clonal lineages throughout the different tissues, we calculated for each lineage with 
a specific combination of tissues the extent of sequence sharing in every pairwise 
combination of tissues (see25 and Methods). The level of sequence sharing we observed 
between different GI tract tissues was higher than between blood-rich tissues (Fig. 3 and 
Supplementary Fig. 11).
The presence of identical sequence variants within clones that reside in different parts of the 
GI tract, as seen in Fig. 3, implies local proliferation after somatic hypermutation.26 
Furthermore, in the GI tract, the branching structures of clonal trees show participation of 
multiple tissue sites in the ongoing mutation and selection process. The fact that identically 
mutated sequences can often be found at multiple GI sites can be explained if mutated 
clones disseminate throughout the GI tract, yet also undergo serial rounds of mutation and 
selection. B cells in these clones are most likely taken up by regional lymphatics, enter the 
thoracic duct and eventually re-seed the GI tract via the blood.27,28
Sequence variation within lineages also provides information about antigen experience and 
the extent of clonal expansion.1,29,30 Clones with somatic VH region mutations were more 
frequent in the tissues than in the blood or bone marrow, suggesting that there are more 
memory B cells in the tissues (Fig. 4a), consistent with previous studies.31-33 Of note, we 
found that the jejunum has the highest fraction of somatically mutated clones in all of the 
donors (Fig. 4a). The jejunum also has many memory T cells13 and is a location where 
memory T cells accumulate in early life.12 Across all donors, GI tract B cell clones 
contained higher fractions of mutated clones and higher numbers of mutations per clone than 
B cells sampled in the other sites (Fig. 4b). GI tract clones also exhibited the highest 
accumulation of synonymous mutations from the nearest germline sequence, consistent with 
them having undergone the greatest number of divisions while the mutation process was 
engaged (Fig. 4c and Methods).34,35
DISCUSSION
Here we used deep immune repertoire profiling to construct an atlas that describes how 
expanded B cell clones distribute and develop within the human body. This resource data set 
is unique in two respects. First, the generation of these data could only be accomplished 
through the analysis of multiple samples from multiple tissues of multiple organ donors. 
Second, the computational analysis of clonal lineages, which relied upon a data set of over 
568 sequencing libraries with over 38 million total IGH gene rearrangements, was at a 
substantially higher scale than previous work and required the development of data analysis 
and visualization tools. The atlas revealed two major networks of large clones, one in the 
blood, bone marrow, spleen and lung, and another in the GI tract. While some clones 
overlapped between the mucosal sites, the restriction of expanded clones in the GI tract was 
striking. Our analysis also revealed that the evolution of clonal lineages appeared to be

 distinctive in the GI tract, which contained large clones with the highest levels of somatic 
hypermutation.
The wide dissemination of some clones within the GI tract is consistent with earlier 
observations in mice and in humans.8,36 The distinctive clonal lineages in the GI tract and 
high levels of somatic hypermutation are consistent with antigen experience and clonal 
longevity, potentially due to chronic exposure to environmental antigens and gut microbiota. 
In mice bacterial microflora have been shown to play a role in clonal generation and 
localization37, however in humans at least some large IgA clones can persist in the colon 
despite antibiotic therapy.8 There may be different classes of endogenous and environmental 
antigens that periodically restimulate large, tissue resident B cell clones in humans. The 
patterns of clonal expansion we have described here also imply that there is a dynamic 
mechanism for mutating, expanding and periodically redistributing members of the same 
clone to different locations within the GI tract. Clones that overlap between the blood and 
one or more tissues, such as the colon, may be circulating subsets of B cells that home to 
specific tissues, as has been described for some IgA-expressing B cells in the blood that 
share antigenic specificities with clones in the human GI tract.38
The generation of this B cell clone tissue atlas required the development of data sharing, 
analysis and visualization tools. The raw sequencing data are shared via GenBank/SRA and 
can be downloaded for further analysis as described in Methods. The data can also be 
accessed and analyzed further using our framework for B cell repertoire analysis, 
ImmuneDB (https://immunedb.com/tissue-atlas).23 With ImmuneDB, we have created 
software applications for data analysis and visualization of high throughput immune 
repertoire profiling experiments. The applications are continuously updated and are available 
at http://immunedb.com and at https://github.com/DrexelSystemsImmunologyLab/ (see 
Methods for further details). This analysis pipeline permits modification of how clones are 
defined and how clone sizes are calculated. While these parameters and calculations are 
fundamental to all immune repertoire studies (see discussions in 19,39-41), they are often not 
explicitly tested when conclusions are drawn about clonal diversity or clonal overlap. Our 
analysis pipeline also is scalable to millions of DNA sequences and permits clone tracing 
across different tissues and samples. We also provide new data visualization tools, including 
“line circle” plots that can be used to view tissue distributions of clones by copy number and 
instance number across different sampling and re-sequencing depths and “clumpiness” to 
measure the degree of intermingling of sequence variants among different tissues within 
clonal lineages (see Methods and 24).
The tissue localization of large clones defined in this study, along with their VH and CDR3 
sequence information, provide normative data for future studies of tissue-specific and 
response-specific motifs in antigen-driven immune responses. These data can also be used 
for general repertoire comparisons between health and disease, where “control” samples 
from tissues are rarely available. Even when antibody sequences are available from tissues in 
other data sets, they may not represent bona fide tissue-specific antibodies because the level 
of clonal overlap with other tissues or the blood is not known as it is with the large clones in 
this data set. In addition to providing data on tissue-based antibody repertoires, this atlas

 provides insights into which tissues have B cell clones that are most connected with the 
blood.
The analysis of somatic hypermutations within individual clonal lineages may contribute to 
a better understanding of how and in what order B cells traffic through tissues. For example, 
clones that originate in one tissue may migrate and accumulate additional somatic 
hypermutations in a different tissue. Clonal lineages can also be analyzed for B cell subset 
representation to gain further insights into ontogenic relationships between different tissue-
based B cell subsets, with more closely related subsets sharing more clonal overlap or other 
repertoire features. Understanding the types of B cell subsets that reside in different tissues 
and how they move through the body could reveal new ways of tracking and targeting B cell 
clones. Furthermore, different selective pressures may be exerted upon large clones residing 
in or passing through different tissues. These differences in the immune environment will 
need to be further defined and taken into account as we monitor and attempt to manipulate 
tissue-specific immunity.

Summary are available in the online version of this paper.
Study subjects
Tissue acquisition was coordinated through a research protocol and material transfer 
agreement with LiveOnNY (formerly the New York Organ Donor Network, NYODN). All 
tissues were obtained from research-consented, deceased (brain dead) organ donors at the 
time of clinical procurement for life-saving transplantation. All donors were free of cancer 
as well as Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and were HIV negative. The study was determined to be 
non-human subjects research by the Columbia University IRB, as tissue samples were 
obtained from deceased individuals. LiveOnNY transplant coordinators identified research-
consented organ donors, and then coordinated tissue acquisition with the on-call surgeon for 
the project. Tissue collection occurred immediately after the donor organs were flushed with 
cold preservation solution and the clinical procurement process was completed. Once 
removed, tissue samples were placed in sterile specimen cups, submerged in cold saline, and 
brought to the laboratory and processed within approximately two to four hours of organ 
procurement.
Sample processing and DNA extraction
Tissues from organ donors were shipped overnight to the University of Pennsylvania. Cells 
were liberated from tissue fragments (approximately 1 cm3 in size) using physical methods 
(tissues were washed with PBS and cut into small pieces using razor blades) and placed in 
lysis buffer with proteinase K following the manufacturer’s directions (Qiagen, Valencia, 
CA, Cat. No. 158667). DNA from peripheral blood and bone marrow were extracted using a 
Qiagen Gentra Puregene blood kit, following the manufacturer’s directions (Qiagen,

 Valencia, CA, Cat. No. 158389). All blood and bone marrow samples were processed upon 
receipt. For D145 and D149, fresh tissue samples were processed when received. For donor 
D168, D181, D182 and D207, tissues were snap frozen and processed later for DNA 
extraction. DNA quality and yield were evaluated by spectroscopy (Nanodrop, 
ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
VH rearrangement amplification
Immunoglobulin heavy chain family-specific PCRs were performed on genomic DNA 
samples. The libraries for sequencing used the Illumina MiSeq platform and were prepared 
using a cocktail of VH1, VH2, VH3, VH4, VH5, VH6 from framework region (FR)1 
forward primers, and one consensus J region reverse primer modified from the BIOMED2 
primer series.42 To capture the full-length VH region sequences, VH family leader primers 
were also used as described.43 Primer sequences and locations are provided in 
Supplementary Table 1 and the number of sequencing libraries prepared with the different 
primer mixes is given for each donor tissue combination in Supplementary Table 2. For the 
VH leader PCR, three separate amplification mixes were prepared for each sample: VH3 and 
VH3-21 primers (mix 1), VH4 and VH6 primers (mix 2), VH1, VH2 and VH5 primers (mix 
3). In each 50μL mix with 1 unit of AmpliTaq gold (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), 
VH leader primers were used at a concentration of 0.6μM, genomic DNA at 200-400 ng 
(except for D168 MLN, which was hypocellular), 0.2 mM dNTPs and 1X PCR buffer with 
1.5mM MgCl2. For the FR1 PCR, the VHFR1 and 3’ JH primers were used at 0.6 μM in a 
reaction volume of 50 μL using the same AmpliTaq Gold system. Valencia, CA). 
Amplification conditions for the leader PCR were primary denaturation followed by cycling 
at 95°C 30s, Ta (56°C for mix 1, 58°C for mix 2 and 60°C for mix 3) for 90s, extension at 
72°C for 90s for 35 cycles, and a final extension step at 72°C for 10 minutes. Amplification 
conditions for FR1 PCR were primary denaturation, followed by cycling at 95°C 45s, 60°C 
for 45s, extension at 72°C for 90s for 35 cycles, and a final extension step at 72°C for 15 
minutes.
Library Preparation and Sequencing
Amplicons were purified using the Agencourt AMPure XP beads system (Beckman Coulter, 
Inc., Indianapolis, IN) in a 1:1 ratio of beads to sample. Second round PCRs to generate the 
sequencing library were carried out using 2-4 μL of the first round PCR product and 2.5 μL 
each of NexteraXT Index Primer S5XX and N7XX primers, 0.325 μL KAPA in a reaction 
volume of 25 μL. Amplifications were carried out as recommended by the manufacturer 
(Illumina, San Diego, CA). To confirm adequacy of amplification, aliquots of both the 1st 
and the 2nd round PCR products were run on agarose gels. Library quality was evaluated 
using Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and quantified by Qubit 
Fluorometric Quantitation (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Grand Island, NY). A sharp single 
band from Bioanalyzer analysis indicated a good quality library and was used for 
sequencing. The reading from Qubit using dsDNA HS (high sensitivity) assay kit (Cat. No. 
Q32851) was used to calculate the molarity of the library. Libraries were then loaded onto an 
Illumina MiSeq in the Human Immunology Core Facility at the University of Pennsylvania. 
2×300 bp paired end kits were used for all experiments (Illumina MiSeq Reagent Kit v3, 
600-cycle, Illumina Inc., San Diego, Cat. No. MS-102-3003).

 Filtering and germline gene association of raw sequence data
Raw sequence data (fastq files) were filtered based upon the positional Q score. A sliding 
window of 10 bases was used to run through all sequences. Any sequence with 10 bp section 
that had an average Q score lower than 20 was removed, along with any sequence that was 
shorter than 100 bases. R1 and R2 sequences were paired using pRESTO version 0.4.7.44 
Sequences which were amplified by FR1 primers were trimmed after alignment to IMGT 
position 82, inclusive, to remove the primer sequence. In the composite R1+R2 read, any 
base with a Q score lower than 20 was replaced with an N and all sequences with more than 
10 N’s were removed. Filtered sequences were aligned to their appropriate germline gene 
using the Anchor method.18 Then a sliding window of 30 nucleotides was used to flag 
insertion/deletions (indels). Any sequence with more than 18 mismatches in a sliding 
window was flagged as potentially having indels. These sequences were also removed.
Identification of unique sequences and association of sets of clonally related sequences
After V(D)J identification, duplicated sequences (those with identical nucleotide sequences) 
were collapsed in a two-level process. First, sequences were collapsed within each sample 
library into sets of unique sequences. Partial sequences were reconstructed into full length 
with their missing bases replaced by ‘N’. All duplicated sequences were collapsed to the 
longest sequence. Second, the numbers of different sequencing libraries that contained the 
same sequence were counted. Each time a sequence appeared at least one time in another 
library, it was counted as a separate “instance” of that sequence. Because DNA was 
sequenced, these instances represented separate B cells in which the same sequence was 
present. For each unique sequence, its total copy number and its number of instances were 
tracked for each tissue and overall in each donor. As PCR amplification and DNA 
sequencing are prone to error45, only sequences with more than one copy were considered 
for analysis. Next, unique sequences (copy >1) were parsed into clones (sets of B cells with 
sufficiently similar VH region rearrangements that they very likely share a common 
ancestry). Sequences were divided into bins with a common VH/JH gene and the same 
CDR3 length.18 Then, all of the sequences in the same bin from a given donor were grouped 
into clones based on their CDR3 amino acid similarity. Any two sequences within the same 
clone have CDR3 sequences that have 85% or higher amino acid identity.19 This process is 
order dependent, so sequences with the highest copy numbers in each bin were the first to be 
associated to a specific clone.
Clone size thresholding and rarefaction analysis
Even at the current level of high-depth sequencing, the true repertoire is being under-
sampled. Sampling is particularly important for estimations of clonal overlap. Only clones 
with larger sizes will be sufficiently sampled to demonstrate overlap or lack of overlap. For 
this analysis, we considered clone size to be the sum of the number of uniquely mutated 
sequences and all the different instances of the same unique sequence that are found in 
separate sequencing libraries. In other words, we sum across all sequencing libraries the 
unique members of a clone that are found in each sequencing library. Thus, for instance, if a 
clone C1 were found in two sequencing libraries (L1 and L2) from spleen and had n unique 
sequences in L1 and m unique sequences in L2, we would say the clone size was n+m, even

 if all of the unique sequences in L2 were identical to those of L1. We refer to this hybrid 
clone size measure as “unique sequence instances.”
To estimate clone sizes for which sampling was sufficient, a sample-based rarefaction 
analysis was performed on clones of different sizes found in exactly two samples.21,46 This 
is a widely accepted method to estimate sufficient sampling in different fields of ecology and 
plant biology. The code written for diversity and rarefication analyses can be found at 
https://github.com/DrexelSystemsImmunologyLab/diversity and in references 47,48. Using 
these methods, we determined that the repertoire of clones with at least 20 unique sequence 
instances in a tissue were sufficiently large that we should be observing three quarters of 
their real population. For this reason, unless stated otherwise, we only considered in our 
analysis clones that had at least 20 unique sequence instances (C20 clones) in at least one 
tissue.
Measures of clonal overlap across samples and across tissues
To measure the amount of overlap between tissues, the cosine similarity was calculated for 
all combinations of two-tissue samples for the most heavily sequenced donors, D207 and 
D181. The cosine similarity is calculated as:
where Ai and Bi are components of vectors A and B, respectively. Each attribute in vector A 
or B represents the size of clone in sample 1 (for example, colon from D207) and sample 2 
(for example, spleen from D207), respectively.
To quantify overlap within a tissue, the clone size was defined as the number of unique 
sequences in each sequencing library from that tissue. Thus the size of clone C in each 
sequencing library Li from a given tissue, was calculated as S(CLi)= ULi, where ULi is the 
number of unique sequences of clone C in sequencing library Li.
To quantify overlap between tissues, clone size was defined as the sum of the number of 
sequencing libraries in which at least one unique sequence variant of the clone occurred for 
each sequence variant within each tissue. In other words, the size of clone C in a given tissue 
was calculated S(Ctissue)= ktissue, where ktissue is the number of sequencing libraries of a 
given tissue in which clone C is found.
To characterize the interconnections of clones between more than two tissues, sequence 
alignment and clone assembly were first processed by MiXCR (version 1.7).49 To compare 
the distribution of overlapping clones across all tissues, the TrackClonotypes function of 
VDJtools (version 1.0.7)50 was used with the default settings. MiXCR was used to 
concatenate all of the FR1 and leader sequencing libraries for each tissue within each donor. 
The analysis was performed with different clone size cut-offs, including 0.01% (the default), 
0.005% and 0.001% of total copies within at least one tissue (Supplementary Fig. 7a). The

 clone size cut-off is expressed as a percentage of total copies in a given tissue from a single 
donor.
Construction of B cell clonal lineages
Lineage trees of clonally related sequences (clonal lineages) were made based on their 
mutations using clearcut v1.0.9 with traditional neighbor joining and deterministic joining.24 
To reduce the contribution of sequencing errors, when calculating clumpiness (see section on 
Sequence sharing across tissues, Methods), we considered only mutations that occurred in at 
least two sequences in a donor. Lineage nodes could thus include multiple unique sequences 
a single mutation apart and their multiple sample instances.
Sequence sharing across tissues measured by clumpiness within clonal lineages
Clumpiness is a measure of the tendency of two label types to be close on a given 
hierarchical structure.25 In the lineage tree of a clone that spans two or more tissues, a higher 
clumpiness value indicates that members of the clone exhibit more intermingling (mixing 
and overlapping of sequence variants) in the different tissues. In this case, we assessed the 
clumpiness of tissue types that annotated the mutant B cell receptor lineages. The 
clumpiness of clonal lineages was calculated by applying the clumpiness measure to each 
tissue and pairs of tissues on a B cell lineage tree. Clumpiness measures the clumping of 
groups of leaves, so the lineages were transformed in such a way that any intermediate 
vertex containing a compartment label became an unlabeled vertex with an additional edge 
connecting a leaf with the compartment label. For the analysis in Fig. 3b and Supplementary 
Fig. 11, we considered all C20 clones in D207. Some sequences / nodes are themselves 
observed in multiple tissues. However, in most cases the relationship was lopsided, with one 
tissue being highly dominant. We therefore assigned a tissue to each node by the tissue of 
the majority of sequence instances found at that position in the lineage. The code written for 
the analysis of clumpiness can be found at https://github.com/
DrexelSystemsImmunologyLab/find-clumpiness and is described in 25.
Mutation analysis
We calculated the average mutation frequency of each clone in each tissue. All instances of 
each unique sequence within a clone (across multiple sequencing libraries from a given 
tissue) were compared to their assigned germline VH gene. For Figs. 4a and 4b, the 
mutation frequency was calculated as the number of mismatched nucleotides divided by 
total number of nucleotides to the end of V gene until three mismatches were found in 
CDR3. The mutation frequency of clone in a given tissue was calculated as the average of 
mutation frequency of all sequences in that clone that belonged to that tissue. To assess 
clonal division during somatic mutation, we counted the maximal number of synonymous 
mutations from the germline observed in each clone. Only synonymous mutations in amino 
acids that are encoded with 4 codons were considered; such “four-fold silent” codons encode 
the same amino acid with any nucleotide in the third position, hence mutations in the third 
position of these codons should be neutral to selection.

 Significance testing
In all cases non-parametric statistical tests were used to compare distributions and the 
necessary assumptions for these tests were met. The Kurskal-Wallis one-way analysis of 
variance was used to show that sets of distributions differed. The Mann Whitney test was 
used to compare between individual distributions.

 Figure 1. Diversity, Similarity and Networks of Large Clones
(a) Peripheral blood clones exhibit the highest sampled diversity. Diversity of clones with at 
least 20 unique sequence instances (C20 clones) is plotted at different orders (Hill numbers) 
in different tissues in D207. At an order of 0, the diversity is the number of different clones. 
At orders >1, diversity is influenced more by the most abundant clones. (b) Tissues exhibit 
higher internal similarity than blood. Box plots represent the distribution of cosine similarity 
between all pairs of sequencing libraries within a tissue (see Methods). Similarity is assessed 
for C20 clones in D207. Boxes represent the first and third quartiles bisected by the median. 
Whiskers represent the most extreme data excluding outliers, where outliers (dots) are data 
beyond the third or first quartile by a distance exceeding 1.5 times the inter-quartile interval. 
Higher cosine values correspond to greater sharing of large clones between replicate 
libraries from the same tissue. (c) Large clones form two major networks– one in blood-rich 
compartments (red tones) and one in the GI tract (blue tones). Shown are the cosine 
similarities of C20 clones between tissue pairs in D181 and D207. Each wedge within the

 Figure 2. Tissue Distributions of Large Clones
(a) Global (found in 6-8 tissues); (b) Regional (3-5 tissues) and (c) Two-Tissue C20 Clones. 
Each line is a clone. Each circle denotes membership of the clone in a particular tissue. The 
size of circle represents the total number of sequence instances the clones have in each tissue 
(depicted in legend). The portion of the circle that is colored represents the fraction of 
sequencing libraries from that tissue that contain at least one sequence of the clone (with at 
least two copies). The frequencies of each distribution type are indicated to the right of each 
clone line. Only the most frequent tissue distribution types (those that are present in at least 
5% of a given tissue category in at least one of the two donors—D181 or D207) are shown. 
Tissues are colored as in Fig 1. lun = lung; jej = jejunum; col = colon; other abbreviations 
are as in Fig. 1.

 Figure 3. Analysis of Sequence Variants in Clonal Lineages
(a) Multi-tiered clonal lineages exhibit diversification and sharing of sequence variants 
within and between tissues. Trees are rooted in the closest germline VH gene allele in the 
IMGT database (see Methods). Numbers indicate somatic mutations. Circles are colored 
according to the tissue distribution of the sequence variants. Circle sizes are proportional to 
sequence copy numbers. Black dots indicate inferred nodes. Each clone is identified by an 
unique identifier number in http://immunedb.com/tissue-atlas. (b) GI tract tissue clones 
exhibit extensive sharing of sequence variants. The median of the distribution of clumpiness 
(a metric of sequence sharing within clonal lineages, see Methods) is shown for all two-
tissues pairs across all C20 clones. (c) Sequence sharing distributions within clonal lineages 
that are found in different tissue pairs. Clones with peripheral blood (PBL) and another 
tissue were the least mixed, followed by clones mixing blood and GI tract tissues, then blood 
tissue clones and finally GI tract clones were the most mixed. SPL = spleen.

 Figure 4. Somatic Hypermutation in Different Tissues
(a) Clones are more mutated in the tissues. Shown are percentages of clones that have 
average mutation frequencies of 1% or more. In all clones, only sequences from a specific 
tissue are counted (see Methods). Each column represents a separate tissue. Each dot 
represents an individual donor. (b) GI tract clones have right-shifted mutation frequency 
distributions compared to blood tissue clones in most donors. The average number of 
mutations per clone is plotted versus the percent of clones with that mutation level. Each line 
denotes a separate tissue. Segregation of mutations per clone to different tissues was 
accomplished as in Fig. 4a (see Methods). (c) Lineage tree heights of C20 single-tissue 
clones in different tissues of D207. Only tissues with >100 single tissue clones are shown.

Library indicates the number of sequencing libraries generated per donor. Total copies refers to the total number of valid IGH rearrangement sequences. Unique seq refers to the total number of unique in-
frame sequences without a stop codon (productive rearrangements). Clones refers to the number of clonally related sequences, defined as having the same VH gene, the same CDR3 length and 85% 
sequence identity in the CDR3 (see Methods). C20 clones have at least 20 unique sequence instances (see text).
