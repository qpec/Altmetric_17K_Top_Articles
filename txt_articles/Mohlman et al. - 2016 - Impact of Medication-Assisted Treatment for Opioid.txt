In the face of increasing rates of overdose deaths, escalating health care costs, and the tremendous social costs
of opioid addiction, policy makers are asked to address the questions of whether and how to expand access to
treatment services. In response to an upward trend in opioid abuse and adverse outcomes, Vermont is investing
in statewide expansion of a medication-assisted therapy program delivered in a network of community practices
and specialized treatment centers (Hub & Spoke Program). This study was conducted to test the rationale for
these investments and to establish a pre-Hub & Spoke baseline for evaluating the additive impact of the program.
Using a serial cross-sectional design from 2008 to 2013 to evaluate medical claims for Vermont Medicaid
beneficiaries with opioid dependence or addiction (6158 in the intervention group, 2494 in the control group),
this study assesses the treatment and medical service expenditures for those receiving medication-assisted
treatment compared to those receiving substance abuse treatment without medication. Results suggest that
medication-assisted therapy is associated with reduced general health care expenditures and utilization, such
as inpatient hospital admissions and outpatient emergency department visits, for Medicaid beneficiaries with
opioid addiction. For state Medicaid leaders facing similar decisions on approaches to opioid addiction, these
results provide early support for expanding medication-assisted treatment services rather than relying only on
psychosocial, abstinence, or detoxification interventions.

1. Introduction
1.1. Opioid Epidemic
Opioid addiction continues to grow as a public health problem with
significant impacts on morbidity and mortality, health care expendi-
tures, crime, and health outcomes. In 2013, 1.9 million Americans
were dependent on pain relievers, and 517,000 were dependent on her-
oin (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA), 2014a) Kolodny et al. estimated that this figure was closer
to 5 million when including individuals with active opioid prescriptions
who may also have been addicted (Kolodny, Courtwright, Hwang, et al.,
2015). While use of prescription opioids has held steady or declined
since 2002, heroin use has increased (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). 2014a). The growth in
heroin use has carried over to patterns in mortality, which is increasing
nationally (Department of Health and Human Services, 2015). In 2010,
3036 deaths resulted from heroin overdoses and 16,651 deaths from
opioid pain reliever overdoses. In 2013, heroin overdose deaths more
than doubled to 8257 while opioid pain reliever overdose deaths
dropped slightly to 16,235 (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2015).
Furthermore evidence associates nonmedical use of pain relievers
with subsequent heroin use (Muhuri, Gfroerer, & Davies, 2013),
highlighting the link between licit and illicit drug use and the need to
address both as a continuum of the same epidemic.
Vermont's experience mirrors the national trend. Nonmedical use of
prescription pain relievers among Vermonters age 12 years and older
declined between 2012 and 2013 (from 4.6% to 3.7%; p-value b0.01),
(Substance
Abuse
and
Mental
Health
Services
Administration
(SAMHSA), 2014b) even as opiate-attributed deaths (from 39 to 68
per year) and overdoses (from 1.4 to 2.2 discharges per 10,000 people)
increased from 2010 to 2013 (Vermont Department of Health, 2014a).
Between 2008 and 2012, the average number of infants exposed to
opiates at birth more than doubled, increasing from 17.8 births per
1000 hospital deliveries to 39.8 (Vermont Department of Health,
2014b). One possible explanation for the increase in adverse opioid-
related outcomes is an increase in heroin use. The addictions treatment
system intake experience appears to support this conclusion. From 2011
to 2013, the number of Vermonters receiving treatment for prescription
opiates and heroin increased from 2864 (654 for heroin and 2210 for

 prescription opiates) to 3971 (1375 for heroin and 2596 for prescription
opiates) — a 38.6% overall increase, with a 110.2% increase for heroin
and a 17.5% increase for prescription opiates (Vermont Department
of Health, 2014b).
The combination of increasing overdose deaths, opiate-exposed
newborns, and demand for treatment services constituted a public
health emergency, and Vermont policymakers determined that
a systemic response was needed. However, in a small, rural state,
policymakers must consider the cost of expanding access to treatment
for opioid addiction and the impact on overall health care and medical
service expenditures.
1.2. Treatment for Opioid Abuse or Dependence
Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) is defined by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services' Center for Substance
Abuse Treatment as “the use of medications, in combination with
counseling and behavioral therapies to provide a whole patient
approach to the treatment of substance use disorders” (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 2016).
The approach involves long-term use of medications and is akin to insu-
lin use among people with diabetes. Evidence has demonstrated that
MAT, the combination of medication and counseling, is more effective
at treatment retention and reduction of heroin and prescription opiate
abuse than using time-limited medication (i.e., opioid detoxification or
tapering) or psychosocial and abstinence interventions; the latter ap-
proaches are associated with higher rates of relapse (Fullerton, Kim,
Thomas, et al., 2014; Thomas, Fullerton, Kim, et al., 2014). Furthermore,
maintenance MAT is associated with improved birth outcomes when
given to opioid-addicted pregnant women, although neonatal absti-
nence syndrome remains a concern (Fullerton et al., 2014; Thomas
et al., 2014). Both Fullerton et al. and Thomas et al. found mixed results
on whether MAT affected the use of other illicit drugs, criminal behav-
ior, and risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepati-
tis C virus (HCV). Other studies, however, do indicate an association
between MAT and reduced overall mortality and specifically while in
prison, recidivism, and treatment engagement among those recently re-
leased from prison (Degenhardt, Larney, Kimber, et al., 2014; Farrell-
MacDonald, MacSwain, Cheverie, Tiesmaki, & Fischer, 2014; Larney,
Gisev, Farrell, et al., 2014; Zaller et al., 2013).
1.3. Cost of Medication-Assisted Treatment for Opioid Abuse or Dependence
While the effectiveness of maintenance MAT in reducing opioid use
has been demonstrated, the treatment itself comes with higher direct
costs than tapering, abstinence, or psychosocial interventions. In 2009,
$866 million was spent across all payers on substance abuse prescrip-
tion medicine, 93% of which went towards buprenorphine, one of the
drugs used to treat opioid addiction (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 2013). While the costs of
methadone are negligible, the daily dosing and other services provided
in opioid treatment programs (OTPs) where methadone is dispensed
are relatively high.
However, the question remains as to whether MAT costs can be
offset by reductions in other health care expenditures. Relatively few
studies have examined the total cost of health care services for opioid
addicts. Two studies have looked at data from commercial health
insurance claims on the overall health care costs and utilization rates
for those using MAT compared to those treated without MAT (Baser,
Chalk, Fiellin, & Gastfriend, 2011; McCarty et al., 2010). McCarty et al.
found that over a five-year period, members on MAT had 50% lower
total annual health plan costs than those who had two or more visits
to an addiction treatment department and no methadone and 62%
lower than those with zero or one visit for addiction treatment and no
methadone (McCarty et al., 2010). Baser et al. found that after a six-
month period, those with MAT had significantly lower overall annual
health plan costs compared to those with no medication ($10,192 vs.
$14,353; p-value b0.0001) (Baser et al., 2011). The difference was
driven largely by lower inpatient services and non-opioid-related out-
patient services for the group receiving medication (Baser et al., 2011).
McAdam-Marx et al. reported in 2010 that Medicaid beneficiaries
with opioid abuse, dependence, or poisoning had nearly triple the
total medical costs adjusted for baseline sample characteristics com-
pared to beneficiaries matched by age, gender, and state with no opioid
abuse diagnosis ($23,556 vs. $8436; p-value b0.001). The opioid depen-
dence/abuse group also had higher prevalence of comorbidities, such as
psychiatric disorders, pain-related diagnoses, and other substance
abuse conditions (McAdam-Marx, Roland, Cleveland, & Oderda, 2010).
While this study considered overall cost, it did not address MAT costs
in particular or any impact treatment may have had on overall cost.
Focusing specifically on a Medicaid population is important for two
reasons. First, Medicaid beneficiaries as a population remain at greater
risk for substance abuse, including opioid addiction and overdose.
Approximately 12% of Medicaid beneficiaries between ages 18 and 64
years has a substance use disorder (Mann, Frieden, Hyde, Volkow, &
Koob, 2014). In Washington State, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) found that between 2004 and 2007, 45.5% of
fatal prescription opioid painkiller overdoses involved people enrolled
in Medicaid (Coolen, Best, Lima, Sabel, & Paulozzi, 2009). Second,
Medicaid's share of all substance abuse expenditures has increased
from 9% to 21% between 1986 and 2009 (Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 2013). This equates to Med-
icaid spending approximately $5 billion in 2009 on substance abuse
treatment, an amount that includes federal, state, and local funds. This
dollar amount and the findings by McAdam-Marx et al. (2010) indicate
that state Medicaid programs have an interest in understanding the
potential impact of expanding MAT services on total expenditures and
utilization of medical services.
This study examines Vermont's Medicaid expenditures for opioid
addiction treatment and other medical and non-medical services, in-
cluding special Medicaid services (SMS), which are services uniquely re-
imbursed by Medicaid that target social, economic, and rehabilitative
needs (e.g., transportation, home and community-based services, case
management, dental, residential treatment, day treatment, mental
health facilities, and school-based services). More explicitly, it compares
the health care expenditures between two groups with opioid addic-
tion: those receiving MAT (“MAT group”), specifically methadone or
buprenorphine, and those receiving non-medication treatment ap-
proaches, such as behavioral therapies alone (“non-MAT group”), with
the goal of assessing the cost effectiveness of MAT and establishing
baseline data against which expanded and enhanced treatment access
can be evaluated.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Data Source and Sample Population
This study reviewed annual medical expenditures and utilization
rates (per person) for Vermont Medicaid enrollees from 2008 to 2013
who were identified as having an opioid addiction or dependency. The
data source for this study was Vermont's all-payer claims database,
the Vermont Health Care Uniform Reporting and Evaluation System
(VHCURES). Due to limitations arising from the statutorily-mandated
de-identified status of VHCURES, this study could not use a cohort
design, but instead relied on annual cross-sectional data for each year
in the study period.
The study population included members with Medicaid coverage,
ages 18–64 years, who had claims in VHCURES indicating treatment
for opioid addiction between the calendar years 2008 and 2013. Within
each year, members participating in MAT were compared to members
with opioid addiction receiving non-MAT therapies. Expenditures and
10

 selected utilization measures were evaluated for the MAT and non-MAT
groups over the six-year period.
The inclusion criteria for the MAT group were based on claims data
for the two primary drugs used in MAT: methadone and buprenorphine.
Methadone is dispensed only at designated treatment facilities (Opioid
Treatment Programs or OTPs). Prior to 2013 in Vermont, buprenorphine
was prescribed only in general medical offices by authorized physicians
(Office Based Opioid Treatment or OBOT). Members receiving metha-
done treatment were selected using the Healthcare Common Procedure
Coding System (HCPCS) program code H0020 in the claims data. Mem-
bers receiving buprenorphine treatment were selected using a list of
National Drug Codes (NDCs), with the exclusion of any form of
buprenorphine when prescribed specifically for pain management. In
addition, patients under any treatment for chronic pain were excluded.
The non-MAT comparison group was also identified using claims data.
These included members who never received MAT and had at least two
opioid addiction diagnoses (i.e., ICD-9 codes 304.00, 304.01, 304.02,
304.70, 304.71, 304.72) on different dates of service, suggesting ongoing ad-
diction. The opioid addiction treatment for the non-MAT population includ-
ed individual and group outpatient services, intensive outpatient programs,
partial hospitalization, detoxification, and residential treatment services
identified from the claims data using HCPCS and revenue codes.i As in the
MAT group, patients under any treatment for chronic pain were excluded.
For each calendar year, MAT and non-MAT members were evaluated
using demographics and health status (Table 1). Demographic mea-
sures included age, gender, and county of residence. Health status indi-
cators included major mental health disorders (i.e., schizophrenia,
major depression, bipolar and other psychoses), selected chronic dis-
ease diagnoses (i.e., asthma, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), congestive
heart failure, coronary heart disease, depression, diabetes, and hyper-
tension), and 3 M™ Clinical Risk Group (CRG) categories, which were
used to identify differences in health status for other conditions
(e.g., cancer) among the MAT and non-MAT populations. For purposes
of ensuring a large enough subsample, the CRG categories were grouped
into five categories: opioid-addicted only (which included those
addicted or dependent on opioids with no comorbidities or complicat-
ing diagnoses); having a history of significant acute disease, a single
minor chronic disease, or minor chronic disease in multiple organ sys-
tems; having a single dominant or moderate chronic disease; having
significant chronic disease in multiple organ systems; and having dom-
inant chronic disease in three or more organ systems, metastatic and
complicated malignancies, or catastrophic conditions. Members with
claims indicating pre- and perinatal care or HCV positivity were also
identified. A measure of continuity of enrollment in Medicaid (“Medicaid
in the Prior Year”) was assigned for a member who was enrolled in Medicaid
during both the study period year and the prior year.
2.2. Statistical Analysis
To reduce the effect of extreme outlier cases, total expenditures
were capped at the 99th percentile for each group (Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services, 2014).
Demographic data for each group was compared with a χ2 goodness
of fit test with the significance level set at 0.05 (Table 1). Multivariable
linear regression models were used to evaluate the expenditure and uti-
lization dependent variables that were derived from claims data. Expen-
diture and utilization measures included those listed in Table 2.
The “Total Expenditures” model included the costs of all medical ser-
vices and the costs associated with opioid addiction treatments for both
the MAT group and the non-MAT group, as described above. The “Total
Expenditures without Treatment” model excluded all opioid addiction
treatment costs to determine the impact of MAT on medical

 expenditures alone. All expenditure outcomes and utilization rates
listed in Table 2 were adjusted for partial enrollment within the calen-
dar year and the independent variables included MAT status, gender,
age group, pre- and perinatal status, HCV status, “Medicaid in prior
year” status, and health status as measured by CRGs. Chronic diseases
and mental health disorders were excluded from the regression because
they were encompassed by the CRGs. The independent variable of MAT
v. non-MAT was created as a binary (0/1) variable, as were “Women
with pre- and perinatal care”, HCV, and “Medicaid in the prior year”.
The remaining were multi-level indicator variables - the model adjusted
for age and gender groups using males 18–34 as the reference group,
and health status based on CRG groups using “opioid-addicted only”
as the reference group.
All statistical analysis was done with SAS version 9.3.
3. Results
3.1. Sample Population and Demographics
Over the period from 2008 to 2013, we identified 6158 unique
Medicaid beneficiaries with a diagnosis for opioid misuse and health
care claims for MAT, and 2494 unique Medicaid patients with a diagno-
sis of opioid misuse but no claims for MAT. Table 1 compares the health
status and demographics for Medicaid members who received MAT and
non-MAT treatment between 2008 and 2013. The MAT group was
slightly younger with higher proportion of 18–34 year olds in both
genders (79.0% vs. 64.3% for females and 73.8% vs. 64.6% for males).
Overall the MAT group was more likely to be female (50.3% vs. 44.3%;
p-value b0.001). In line with this trend, MAT members had a higher
rate of pre- and perinatal care compared to non-MAT (16% vs 6%).
MAT members also had a higher prevalence of known positive tests
for HCV (21% vs 10%) and were more likely than non-MAT to have
continuity of coverage in Medicaid as indicated by having Medicaid in
the prior year (88.9% vs. 81.6%). The prevalence of members with
serious mental health disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, major depression,
bipolar and other psychoses) in MAT was slightly higher than non-
MAT (22% vs. 20%), but the difference was not statistically significant
(p-value = 0.23).
Table 1 also compares risks groups and prevalence of select condi-
tions between the two groups. Based on the χ2 goodness of fit test,
there was significant difference in the distribution of the risk groups
among the MAT and non-MAT groups. The non-MAT group had higher
proportions categorized as opioid-addicted only (i.e., those with opioid
addiction or dependency but without comorbidities or complicating di-
agnoses) or as having acute illness or a minor chronic disease. The MAT
group had higher proportions with a single dominant or moderate
chronic disease or a significant chronic disease in multiple organ sys-
tems. Both groups had low rates of cancer and catastrophic conditions.
Of the selected chronic conditions with significant differences between
the two groups, MAT had higher prevalence of ADHD, depression, and
asthma and a lower prevalence of hypertension and diabetes.
3.2. Multivariable Regression Results
Table 2 shows the adjusted expenditure and utilization rates per
person for the MAT and the non-MAT groups and the differences be-
tween the two study populations. In all categories of expenditures ex-
cept prescriptions, members of the MAT group had lower costs. For
total medical expenditures, including treatment costs, the MAT group's
annual expenditures were $412 less than the non-MAT group's expen-
ditures, although this difference was not significant (p-value: 0.07).
When opioid addiction treatment costs for both groups were excluded,
the difference in annual expenditures of the MAT group relative to the
non-MAT group grew to −$2409 (p-value: b0.01). In each of the four
expenditure subcategories (inpatient, outpatient, professional services,
and special Medicaid services expenditures) the MAT group's medical
expenditures were significantly lower, with the largest difference seen
in inpatient expenditures (−$1625). For the utilization categories
(Table 2), the MAT group has significantly lower utilization rates per
person across all categories except for primary care physician visits
and surgical specialist visits.
The expenditure models also found that, independent of MAT status,
a positive diagnosis of HCV was associated with significantly higher
costs for both models: $3518 (p-value: b0.01) in the “Total Expendi-
tures” model and $2679 (p- value: b0.01) in the “Total Expenditures
Without Treatment Costs” model. Conversely, being enrolled in
Medicaid in the previous year was associated with lower costs: −$1169
(p-value: b0.01) in the “Total Expenditures” model and −$630 (p-value:
0.01) in the “Total Expenditures without Treatment Costs” model.
4. Discussion
4.1. Findings
The results indicated that the overall difference in annual average
expenditures was lower for the MAT group, even with the cost of
MAT, but not significantly lower. However, when opioid addiction treat-
ment costs were removed, the MAT group had substantial and statisti-
cally significant lower health care costs overall compared to the non-
MAT group. This was especially noteworthy given the MAT group's
higher rates of pre- and perinatal care, HCV positivity, and more severe
health status according to risk groupings (higher proportions of young
females and higher rates of pre- and perinatal care were expected be-
cause pregnant women were prioritized for MAT treatment, especially
in OTPs). Evaluation of the utilization rates suggests that reduction in
cost was due, in part, to lower inpatient admissions and outpatient hos-
pital emergency department visits. The higher rate of primary care visits
for the MAT group was expected since buprenorphine is prescribed in
general medical offices. It may also indicate that MAT may be successful-
ly linking patients with preventive care services. The increased utiliza-
tion of the surgical specialists and the decreased utilization of imaging
services will require additional analysis to identify the reasons for

 these trends. Overall, however, this study, in conjunction with the many
studies supporting MAT treatment efficacy, suggests that expanding
Vermont's MAT services for its Medicaid-enrolled population has the
potential to produce better opioid addiction treatment results and
lower overall health care costs compared to other approaches to opioid
addiction treatment.
The findings also indicate that more continuous enrollment in Med-
icaid was associated with reduced expenditures independent of the
MAT program. One interpretation of this result is that newly insured
members tended to have higher initial health care utilization if they
had been without it beforehand, and their continued enrollment led to
a reduction in health care expenditures. Further study is needed to eval-
uate this conclusion and its implications on expanding MAT services.
Another point addressed in the results is the prevalence of HCV
among the opioid-addicted population. As noted in Table 1, 20.6% of
MAT members and 10.0% of non-MAT members were diagnosed with
HCV between 2008 and 2013. By comparison, chronic HCV prevalence
in the US is approximately 0.8% (Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC), 2016). Further inquiry into the reasons behind this dif-
ference should be pursued, such as whether there is increased HCV
screening for MAT patients, a possibility supported by another study
(Larney, Grebely, Falster, et al., 2015), or greater referral among Medic-
aid beneficiaries with HCV to MAT services. Additionally, further analy-
sis should evaluate the factors contributing to cost such as severity of
HCV-associated disease and treatment-seeking patterns. HCV treatment
is expensive, especially the combination therapies involving the rela-
tively new sofosbuvir and ledispasvir approved after the time frame
for this study; however, these drugs have significantly reduced side
effects and treatment times (6–12 weeks vs. 24–48 weeks) and produce
higher cure rates (85%–95% vs. 50%–80%) than the traditional
pegylated-interferon with riboviron therapy (Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention (CDC), 2016). Should MAT provide a means for im-
proved HCV detection through increased screening, MAT may have the
added benefit of reducing HCV transmission (Tsui, Evans, Lum, Hahn, &
Page, 2014; White, Dore, Lloyd, Rawlinson, & Maher, 2014) and the
medical complications that arise from chronic HCV infection.
4.2. Limitations
While VHCURES data have been validated as a reliable data source
(Hoffer & Stein, 2014), they do have some limitations relevant to this
study. First, as mentioned above, the de-identified status of VHCURES
makes cohort studies difficult; therefore we used annual cross-
sectional for each year in the study period.
Second, the dataset did not allow for the estimation of methadone
costs in isolation. The HCPCS program code, which is used to identify
MAT members receiving methadone and their treatment costs, com-
bines medication and health home services. Furthermore, methadone
is not present in pharmacy claims, limiting the ability to find treated
members and isolate methadone medication costs.
Third, the data may include some bias due to the influence of
outliers. While outliers were capped at the 99th percentile, they
could still potentially influence the results given the small sample size.
However, since the yearly dollar amounts were consistent (data not
shown), this influence is likely minimal.
Finally, a few unmeasurable confounders could also have introduced
bias to this study such as unaccounted differences in the severity of opi-
oid addiction between the MAT and non-MAT groups and access to
treatment. Additional studies on these factors would improve further
evaluations of MAT.
5. Conclusion
Given that total health care expenditures did not differ significantly
(p-value: 0.07) even with the higher costs of MAT services and medica-
tions, the outlook for a statewide program focused on providing
maintenance MAT is favorable. While the total addictions treatment
costs were higher for the MAT group, these were offset by much lower
health care utilization and expenditures, indicating an insignificant
overall cost difference between the MAT and non-MAT groups. While
causation cannot be determined in this study, the results, along with
strong evidence that maintenance MAT is more effective at achieving
treatment retention and reducing opioid use (Fullerton et al., 2014;
Thomas et al., 2014), present a persuasive argument for expanding a
MAT-centered opiate addiction treatment program throughout the
state of Vermont.
Toward the end of this study's time frame (mid-2013), Vermont,
through its health care delivery reform program, the Vermont Blueprint
for Health, began to roll out a comprehensive services design built on
MAT and the opportunity for Health Homes offered under the Afford-
able Care Act. The goal of this program, also known as Hub (OTPs) and
Spoke (OBOT or buprenorphine-prescribing providers), was to expand
access to methadone, enhance methadone treatment programs by
linking Health Home Services with primary and community services,
and providing clinical staff to support and complement primary care
providers waivered to prescribe buprenorphine.
The results of this study serve as a strong baseline by which to eval-
uate Vermont's Hub and Spoke program and to assess whether the re-
duction in medical costs have continued under the program's service
enhancements. Additionally, the methodology employed in this study
will be expanded to analyze the impact of MAT beyond health care,
such as on incarceration rates, employment rates, and rates of child
and family services. These subsequent studies will provide a fuller
understanding of the societal costs and savings of opioid addiction
and treatment.
Acknowledgments
The authors gratefully acknowledge Jeff Stoddard (Onpoint) for
manuscript review. The authors would like to highlight the extraordi-
nary leadership of the Honorable Governor Peter Shumlin of Vermont
for highlighting the issues of opioid addiction in his 2014 “State of the
State” speech and dedicating the resources of his administration to de-
veloping a systemic policy response in Vermont. The authors also recog-
nize the distinguished leadership of the Vermont Department of Health
by Commissioner Harry Chen and Deputy Barbara Cimaglio for develop-
ing the addictions treatment system and for their commitment to inte-
gration and collaboration with the Blueprint for Health. The authors
wish to express their deep gratitude for the administrative and clinical
leadership provided by Mark Larsen, Victoria Loner, and Carrie
Hathaway in supporting concrete, actionable changes in the health de-
livery system to dramatically improve access to MAT treatment for
Vermonters. Finally, the authors would like to particularly thank the
program partners across the state whose dedicated efforts are
transforming our health and addictions care delivery systems. These in-
clude the program directors at Vermont's opioid treatment programs,
the medical care providers who offer MAT, the Blueprint project man-
agers and practice facilitators who guide and support the treatment sys-
tem, the Dartmouth team supporting practice improvement in MAT
programs, and State Legislators. Together they are changing the face of
health and addictions care for all of us.
Funding: All funding for this study came from annual state appropri-
ated budget for the Vermont Blueprint for Health.
