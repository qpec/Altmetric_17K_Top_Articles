Purpose:
To evaluate the impact of accountable care organizations 
(ACOs) on use of screening mammography in the Medi-
care Shared Savings Program (MSSP), the largest value-
based reimbursement program in U.S. history.
Materials and 
Methods:
Institutional review board approval was waived, as the 
study used publicly available unidentifiable data. Medicare 
data were retrospectively obtained for participating ACOs 
from 2012 to 2014. Baseline information and the ACO-20 
measure (percentage of women aged 40–69 years who 
underwent screening mammography within 24 months) 
were obtained. Negative binomial regression models were 
used to evaluate baseline and longitudinal mammography 
use, with stratified analyses performed for year of entry 
into the ACO, number of beneficiaries, and geographic 
region.
Results:
A total of 333 ACOs with 5 
329 
831 Medicare benefi-
ciaries (mean size, 16 
006 beneficiaries) participated in 
the MSSP. Screening use varied across ACOs (median, 
63.0%; range, 8.8%–90.3%), with differences found 
across regions (use was highest in the Midwest [66.6%] 
and lowest in the South [58.2%], P = .038). A total of 208 
ACOs reported longitudinal outcomes, with mean change 
in screening mammography use of +2.6% (range, 233.2% 
to +42.2%), with 128 (61.6%) ACOs reporting improve-
ments (incidence rate ratio, 1.04; 95% confidence inter-
val: 1.02, 1.07) (P = .002). No longitudinal differences in 
use were seen across regions (P = .078), year of entry (P 
= .902), number of beneficiaries (P = .814), or total com-
posite quality score (P = .324), nor was there a difference 
between ACOs that saved money and those that did not 
(P = .391).
Conclusion:
ACOs in the MSSP have produced small significant im-
provements in screening mammography use.

percentage of women aged 40–69 
years who underwent mammography 
to screen for breast cancer within 24 
months. This measure represents one of 
33 metrics selected by Medicare divided 
into four domains: patient-caregiver 
experience, care coordination–patient 
safety, preventive health, and at-risk 
population metrics (6). In order for an 
ACO to be eligible for shared savings, 
the ACO must show that it meets min-
imum performance (at least 30th per-
centile) on at least 70% of the quality 
metrics in each of the four domains in 
the 3rd year of reporting (quality scores 
in years 1 and 2 are based on the ACO 
successfully reporting data and passing 
any subsequent audit rather than on the 
performance reflected within the data it-
self). If providers show cost savings and 
quality performance, they are eligible for 
at least 50% of the shared savings and 
as much as 60% of the shared savings 
if the ACO is willing to share potential 
losses and savings (6).
The ACO-20 metric was reported 
to Medicare by using the ACO Group 
Practice Reporting Option (or GPRO) 
Web interface. The ACO Group Prac-
tice Reporting Option Web interface in-
volves Medicare prepopulating a sample 
of Medicare beneficiaries in each ACO 
with demographic and claims informa-
tion. The ACO is responsible for filling 
in this prepopulated sample with quality 
would lead to significant increases in 
screening mammography use in partici-
pating ACOs.
Materials and Methods
Study Cohort
The retrospective cohort included 
ACOs entering the MSSP between 2012 
and 2014. ACOs entering the program 
in either 2012 or 2013 that reported 
outcomes at baseline (ie, 2012 or 
2013) and at the most recent report-
ing period (ie, 2014) were included in 
the analysis of longitudinal ACO met-
rics. Data for each ACO were obtained 
from publicly available Medicare data 
on September 1, 2015 (3). Sample size 
of the study cohort was determined 
based on the available number of par-
ticipating ACOs. As the study used 
publicly available data without identifi-
able or potentially identifiable data, in-
stitutional review board approval was 
not required. The study was reported 
in accordance with Strengthening the 
Reporting of Observational Studies in 
Epidemiology (or STROBE) guidelines 
for cohort studies (4).
Variables
Baseline information about participat-
ing ACOs also was collected (location 
[state or states], date of registration 
as an ACO, number of beneficiaries). 
States were further classified into re-
gions (Northeast, Midwest, South, 
West), with census definitions (5).
The primary outcome metric was 
the ACO-20 measure, which is the

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Accountable care organizations 
(ACOs) participating in the 
Medicare Shared Savings Pro-
gram demonstrated a mean 
increase of 2.6% in use of 
screening mammography, with 
61.6% (128 of 208) of ACOs 
reporting improvements; these 
findings were in contrast to find-
ings of prior reports on screening 
mammography in traditional fee-
for-service populations in which 
use was unchanged or declined 
over the same time.
 
n Considerable differences were 
noted from baseline, with in-
creases of up to 42.2% in the use 
of screening mammography; 
these increases are comparable 
to some of the most successful 
previously described multifacto-
rial interventions to improve 
screening mammography.
Implication for Patient Care
 
n Pay-for-performance incentives in 
ACOs can facilitate collaboration 
among various stakeholders 
across the health care continuum 
to improve screening mammog-
raphy use and other key popula-
tion health metrics, results that 
will become increasingly relevant 
as imaging reimbursements tran-
sition from fee-for-service pay-
ment to alternative or value-
based payments.
A
ccountable 
care 
organizations 
(ACOs) have been developed to 
encourage health care provider 
networks to share responsibility for 
health care costs, with financial incen-
tives for networks that reduce costs 
(1). To access these incentives, ACOs 
must also demonstrate improvements 
in health care quality in several areas, 
including 
screening 
mammography. 
The Medicare Shared Savings Program 
(MSSP) is the largest such program in 
the United States, allowing ACOs to 
share in cost savings if they meet spe-
cific quality criteria and produce requi-
site reductions in the total cost of care, 
as measured with Medicare Part A and 
Part B expenditures in their attributed 
populations (2). Screening mammogra-
phy use is the only imaging-related qual-
ity metric in the MSSP, and the impacts 
of 
population-based 
reimbursement 
changes on screening mammography 
use in the MSSP have not been char-
acterized to date. The purpose of our 
study was to evaluate the effect of ACO 
incentives on the use of screening mam-
mography in the MSSP. We hypothesize 
that financial incentives associated with 
improving screening mammography use

negative binomial regression was used, 
with random effects used to account for 
clustering by ACO. Regression models 
were used to compare the cumulative 
incidence of obtaining a mammogram in 
2014 with that of obtaining one in 2012 
or 2013 with unadjusted and adjusted 
incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). Improvement 
in screening mammography use was de-
fined as an increase in screening mam-
mography use between baseline and the 
most recent reporting period (raw in-
crease .0% or IRR .1). The analysis 
adjusting for geographic region and the 
number of Medicare beneficiaries in 
the ACO in the initial year in which the 
ACO joined the MSSP (2012 or 2013) 
was considered as the primary analysis, 
as these two variables were considered 
potential confounders. To evaluate for 
effect modification, we performed strat-
ified analyses by year in which ACOs 
entered the study cohort, as we hypoth-
esized that ACOs that entered the study 
cohort in 2012 would be more incentiv-
ized to demonstrate improved screening 
mammography use than would ACOs 
that entered the study cohort in 2013, 
as the first 2 years of quality data are 
used for reporting only, while the 3rd 
year of data is used for pay-for-perfor-
mance incenctives. Next, we performed 
a stratified analysis to evaluate screen-
ing mammography use by ACOs that 
demonstrated overall shared savings 
versus those that did not. Finally, to ac-
count for missing data in our primary 
hypothesis, we performed additional 
multiple imputation analyses.
P , .05 indicated a significant dif-
ference. Stata software (version 11; 
Stata, College Station, Tex) was used 
for analysis.
Results
In 2014, there were 333 participating 
ACOs with a combined 5 
329 
831 at-
tributed Medicare beneficiaries (mean 
ACO size, 16 
006 beneficiaries; range, 
3498–135 
530 beneficiaries) (Table). In 
terms of location, 20.4% (n = 67) of 
329 ACOs were in the North; 40.1% (n 
= 132), in the South; 18.5% (n = 61), 
in the Midwest; and 14.6% (n = 48), 
Statistical Analyses
Cross-sectional 
and 
longitudinal 
analyses were performed by using the 
downloaded Medicare data described 
previously. 
Cross-sectional 
statistics 
included calculating screening mam-
mography use percentages for ACOs 
reporting in the most recent reporting 
period (ie, 2014). Negative binomial 
regression models were used to model 
the cumulative incidence of obtaining a 
mammogram and to account for over-
dispersion. Likelihood ratios were used 
to evaluate for differences across geo-
graphic regions (categorical variable). 
Univariate analyses were performed to 
evaluate for differences in the cumula-
tive incidence of obtaining a mammo-
gram between ACOs that entered the 
study cohort in 2012 and those that 
entered it in 2013 and for baseline dif-
ferences between ACOs reporting lon-
gitudinal data and those not reporting 
longitudinal data.
Longitudinal statistics were cal-
culated for the 208 ACOs that partic-
ipated in the MSSP for more than 1 
year. Mean differences in use percent-
ages between the most recent reporting 
year (ie, 2014) and the year in which 
the ACO joined the MSSP (ie, 2012 or 
2013) were computed and plotted with 
histograms. To model the cumulative 
incidence of obtaining a mammogram, 
metric data for each patient in the sam-
ple. Twenty-one other metrics are cal-
culated with the ACO Group Practice 
Reporting Option interface, while seven 
measures of the patient-caregiver expe-
rience are collected via patient survey, 
three are calculated via claims, and one 
is calculated from electronic health re-
cord (or EHR) incentive program data. 
While Medicare use reports provided to 
ACOs contain reports on the use of MR 
imaging and CT per 1000 beneficiaries, 
ACO-20 is the only quality metric that 
explicitly involves imaging.
The ACO-20 measure was collected 
for the baseline year (2012 for those 
who started reporting in 2012 and 
2013 for those who started reporting in 
2013) and for the most recent reporting 
year (ie, 2014). Aggregate data regard-
ing whether or not patients underwent 
mammography within 24 months was 
provided for each ACO; individual pa-
tient data were not available.
To ensure accurate information, 
each ACO is required to report data in 
a timely fashion. Additionally, Medicare 
conducts periodic audits of ACO data, 
including the medical records of bene-
ficiaries. If the ACO shows a pattern of 
inaccurate or incomplete reporting of 
quality measures, it will not qualify for 
any shared savings, and it may have its 
contract terminated.

the program (IRR, 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02, 
1.07; P , .001).
Discussion
Our results show that the MSSP, the 
largest value-based population reim-
bursement program in U.S. history, has 
yielded small but significant improve-
ments in mammography use in the first 
3 years of the program. At baseline, 
wide variation was seen in mammog-
raphy use across ACOs, with highest 
use in the Midwest (66.6%) and lowest 
use in the South (58.2%). At follow-up, 
wide variation was still seen in mam-
mography use, with improvements of 
up to 42.2% in screening mammogra-
phy use.
The results are consistent with ear-
lier literature on the effects of ACOs on 
mammography use (7–9). A study eval-
uating the Blue Cross Blue Shield ACO 
in Massachusetts, an early attempt at 
payment reform, revealed lower spend-
ing and generally improved quality 
scores in the Massachusetts ACO when 
compared with the ACOs of nearby 
Northeastern 
states 
(7). 
Although 
mammography-specific numbers were 
not cited in the most recent results of 
the Massachusetts ACO, an early re-
port noted significant improvements in 
in overall cost savings and those that 
did not (IRR, 1.02: 95% CI: 0.96, 1.08; 
P = .516). No correlations were found 
between screening mammography use 
and total composite quality score (P = 
.324), nor were correlations seen be-
tween screening mammography use 
and number of beneficiaries (IRR, 1.00; 
95% CI: 0.99, 1.00; P = .814). No sig-
nificant differences were found when 
we compared changes in screening 
mammography use between ACOs that 
started in 2012 and those that started 
in 2013 (IRR, 1.00; 95% CI: 0.95, 1.06; 
P = .902). When we compared baseline 
characteristics of ACOs that reported 
longitudinal outcomes with those that 
did not (12 of 220, 5.4%), no signif-
icant differences were found in base-
line ACO-20 scores (IRR, 1.07; 95% 
CI: 0.94, 1.22; P = .307), number of 
beneficiaries (IRR, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.58, 
1.27; P = .434), or shared savings (IRR, 
0.93; 95% CI: 0.41, 2.12; P = .391). 
Finally, 4.8% (10 of 208) of ACOs 
did not report at least one or both of 
baseline or follow-up data on screening 
 
mammography use. Multiple imputa-
tion analyses were performed to eval-
uate the effect of missing mammogra-
phy use data and revealed comparable 
significant improvements in screening 
mammography in the first 3 years of 
in the West; 6.4% (n = 21) of ACOs 
spanned multiple regions. Screen-
ing mammography use varied among 
ACOs (mean, 61.4%; median, 63.0%; 
range, 8.8%–90.3%) (Fig 1), with sig-
nificant differences across regions (P 
= .038). Use was highest in the Mid-
west (66.6%) and lowest in the South 
(58.2%).
For the 208 ACOs that reported 
longitudinal outcomes, the mean in-
crease in screening use was 2.6% 
(median, 3.4%), with 61.6% (122 of 
198) of ACOs reporting an improve-
ment in use (Fig 2). We used the ad-
justed negative binomial regression 
model to test our primary hypothesis 
and found significant improvements in 
mammography use (IRR, 1.04; 95% CI: 
1.02, 1.07) (P = .002). In 2012, 51.9% 
(108 of 208) of ACOs began reporting 
mammography use. No significant dif-
ferences in these changes were found 
across regions (P = .078). Wide differ-
ences in use were noted between the 
initial time at which ACOs entered 
the MSSP (ie, 2012 or 2013) and the 
most recent reporting year (ie, 2014), 
with improvements in screening mam-
mography percentages of up to 42.2% 
(range, 233.2% to +42.2%). Stratified 
analyses revealed no evidence of differ-
ences in mammography use between 
ACOs that demonstrated reductions

publication of the U.S. Preventative 
Services Task Force recommendations 
(15–17). Moreover, the large increases 
in mammography use in some ACOs 
(as large as 42.2%) are not likely at-
tributable to shifts in screening mam-
mography patterns or chance variation; 
instead, they are comparable to some 
of the most successful multifactorial 
interventions for increasing breast can-
cer screening, including targeted mail, 
phone calls, and home visits (10).
Additionally, although ACOs have re-
ported higher screening mammography 
use, we do not have information about 
the outcomes associated with increased 
use in these ACO populations. On the 
basis of Breast Cancer Surveillance Con-
sortium data in comparable Medicare-
aged patients (age range, 65–69 years), 
a mean increase of 2.6% in screening 
mammography use would lead to de-
tection of an estimated 732 new can-
cers and 10 
116 false-positive findings 
in a population of 5 
329 
831 Medicare 
beneficiaries (ie, the size of the MSSP 
ACO population in 2014) (18). Although 
ongoing controversies exist about over-
diagnosis and frequency of breast can-
cer screening, the majority of the ma-
jor organizations that publish guidelines 
acknowledge the benefits of breast can-
cer screening in reducing breast cancer 
mortality, particularly in Medicare-aged 
patients aged up to 69 years (19–22).
Additionally, the ACO-20 metric 
was one of only 33 metrics used to de-
termine whether ACOs were eligible 
for shared savings in 2014 (the 2015 
method will use 32 metrics). Conse-
quently, ACOs may emphasize other 
metrics on the basis of local expertise 
or preference. Furthermore, given that 
ACOs are judged on performance in 
only year 3 of reporting, ACOs may de-
fer efforts to improve quality metrics in 
favor of attempts to reduce costs. To 
the extent that any of these phenomena 
occur, this would result in underestima-
tion of the extent to which ACOs can 
increase mammographic screening use.
Finally, for ACOs that first reported 
mammography use data in 2013, ap-
proximately half of the study informa-
tion was derived from a period in which 
these programs were not participating 
serve as an additional method to ensure 
accuracy and completeness of report-
ing. In the 1st year of reporting, only 
5% (n = 11) of the 220 ACOs failed to 
adequately report quality metric data 
(11). Although specifics regarding au-
dits of mammography use data are 
not available, mammography use was 
not one of the metrics cited with mis-
matches between self-reported ACO 
data and Medicare audit data (12).
Although no control groups were 
available in our current study, it is un-
likely that the large improvements in 
screening mammography use seen in 
some ACOs can be explained by overall 
changes in screening use during this time 
period, changes in local practice pat-
terns, or chance variation. When com-
pared with a mean increase of 2.6% in 
screening mammography use in ACOs, 
other nationally representative cohorts 
found either decreased or unchanged 
mammography use over similar time 
periods (13–17). The National Health 
Interview Survey asked a nationally rep-
resentative population-based sample of 
participants about screening mammog-
raphy and found that biennial screening 
mammography in women aged 40 years 
or older decreased from 66.5% to 65.7% 
between 2010 and 2013 (13). Although it 
is possible that some of these patients 
were enrolled in Medicare ACOs, strati-
fied analyses evaluating screening mam-
mography in non–Medicare-aged survey 
participants not eligible for Medicare 
ACOs also revealed decreases in screen-
ing mammography between 2010 and 
2013 (range, 71.4%–72.6% for patients 
aged 50–64 years). Looking specifically 
at fee-for-service Medicare populations, 
screening mammography declined 7.4% 
from 2000 to 2012 before and after pub-
lication of the U.S. Preventative Services 
Task Force guidelines (14). Additionally, 
the ACO-20 metric asked patients about 
screening mammography every other 
year instead of every year. Although it 
is possible that use of a 2-year metric 
instead of a 1-year metric concealed 
changes in screening patterns, other 
population-based reports using the 
same 2-year metric found decreased 
or unchanged screening mammography 
use during similar time periods after 
screening mammography (P = .006) in 
the ACO, despite high baseline mam-
mography use (80%) in both the Mas-
sachusetts ACO (intervention group) 
and the ACOs of nearby Northeastern 
states (control group) (8). An earlier 
MSSP using a payment model similar 
to that of ACOs (the Physician Group 
Practice Demonstration) and involving 
10 physician groups found significant 
improvements in screening mammogra-
phy percentages compared with those 
in control groups (P , .001) (9).
In our study, we found that a ma-
jority of ACOs demonstrated improve-
ments in screening mammography use, 
with some ACOs demonstrating large 
improvements. A wide variety of strat-
egies have been described to improve 
screening mammography use, including 
free on-site mammography, phone calls, 
letters, written material, group health 
education sessions, peer counseling, 
and home visits (10). In a meta-analysis 
of interventions specifically targeted to-
ward low-income women, Gardner et 
al (10) found that interventions were 
associated with an 8.9% increase in 
screening mammography uptake, with 
multifactorial interventions being as-
sociated with the largest increases in 
screening mammography use. Widely 
known strategies used by ACOs to im-
prove screening mammography use in-
clude using both insurance claims and 
electronic health record data to iden-
tify patients who have not undergone 
screening within a defined time period 
and then targeting these patients with 
outbound communications. Additional 
investigation is required to under-
stand the exact strategies and practices 
of high-performing ACOs to enable 
ACOs that experienced decreases in 
mammography use and other non-
ACO health systems to improve use of 
screening mammography.
Limitations of our study included 
reliance on voluntary reporting of mam-
mography use statistics, lack of control 
groups, and limitations of the ACO-20 
metric. Although voluntarily reported 
statistics may yield opportunities for 
ACOs to embellish their baseline or fol-
low-up performance, the penalties as-
sociated with the data auditing process

in the MSSP. Alhough these ACOs may 
have performed either better or worse 
in the time period in which they were 
not participating, stratified analyses of 
longitudinal data revealed no signifi-
cant differences in ACOs that started in 
2013 instead of 2012.
In conclusion, our results show that 
the MSSP, the largest value-based popu-
lation reimbursement program in U.S. 
history, has produced small but signif-
icant improvements in screening mam-
mography use in the first 3 years of the 
program; this finding is in contrast to re-
sults in traditional fee-for-service popu-
lations, in which screening mammogra-
phy use was unchanged or declined over 
the same period. This finding supports 
the concept that aligned incentives facil-
itate collaboration among stakeholders 
across the health care continuum to 
improve population health metrics and, 
by extension, the associated population 
health outcomes. As reimbursements 
transition from fee-for-service to popu-
lation-based models, it will become in-
creasingly important for radiologists to 
work actively with other stakeholders 
to determine and develop effective 
strategies to improve population-based 
health care (23). These collaborations 
will be increasingly relevant, as Medi-
care has publicly announced its intention 
to deliver the majority of fee-for-service 
Medicare payments through such value-
