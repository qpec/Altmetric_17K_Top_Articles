ABSTRACT 
18 
Background: Previous research has demonstrated clear associations between specific 
19 
running injuries and patterns of lower limb kinematics. However, there has been minimal 
20 
research investigating whether the same kinematic patterns could underlie multiple 
21 
different soft tissue running injuries. If they do, such kinematic patterns could be considered 
22 
global contributors to running injury. 
23 
Hypothesis: Injured runners will demonstrate differences in running kinematics when 
24 
compared to injury free controls. These kinematic patterns will be consistent amongst injury 
25 
subgroups. 
26 
Study Design: Case- Control Study 
27 
Methods: We studied 72 injured runners and 36 healthy controls. The injured group 
28 
contained four subgroups of runners with either patellofemoral pain, iliotibial band 
29 
syndrome, medial tibial stress syndrome or Achilles tendinopathy (n = 18 each). Three-
30 
dimensional running kinematics were compared between injured and healthy runners and 
31 
then between the four injured subgroups. A logistic regression model was used to 
32 
determine which parameters could be used to identify injured runners. 
33 
Results: The injured runners demonstrated greater contralateral pelvic drop and forward 
34 
trunk lean at mid-stance and a more extended knee and dorsiflexed ankle at initial contact. 
35 
The subgroup ANOVA found these kinematic patterns were consistent across each of the 
36 
 3 
 
four injury subgroups. Contralateral pelvic drop was found to be the most important 
37 
variable predicting classification of participants as healthy/injured. Importantly, for every 1° 
38 
increase in pelvic drop there was an 80% increase in the odds of being classified injured.  
39 
Conclusion: This study identified a number of global kinematic contributors to common 
40 
running injuries. In particular, we found injured runners to run with greater peak 
41 
contralateral pelvic drop and trunk forward lean, as well as an extended knee and 
42 
dorsiflexed ankle at initial contact. Contralateral pelvic drop appears to be the variable most 
43 
strongly associated with common running related injuries.  
44 
Clinical Relevance: The identified kinematic patterns may prove beneficial for clinicians 
45 
when assessing for biomechanical contributors to running injuries.

INTRODUCTION 
67 
Running is an increasingly popular method of physical activity, however it also poses a risk 
68 
of injury to the musculoskeletal system. It has been reported that approximately 50% of 
69 
runners become injured annually with 25% injured at any one time.13 The majority of 
70 
running related injuries are considered to be overuse injuries, with the most frequently 
71 
injured sites including the knee, foot and lower leg, with incidence rates reported of around 
72 
50%, 39% and 32% respectively 46. Less common injury sites include the ankle and lower 
73 
back, as well as the hip and pelvis, with incidence rates ranging from 4% to 16%, 5% to 19% 
74 
and 3 to 11% respectively45. Of all running related injuries, the most frequently cited injuries 
75 
include patellofemoral pain, iliotibial band syndrome, medial tibial stress syndrome, Achilles 
76 
tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, stress fractures and muscle strains.24, 44 Many of these 
77 
injuries are known to have high reoccurrence rates, leading to a reduction or cessation of 
78 
training in approximately 30 to 90% of cases.47 The factors related to the development of 
79 
 5 
 
running related injuries are multifactorial and diverse, however it is widely accepted that 
80 
abnormal running kinematics play a role.1, 7, 31  
81 
There has been a large amount of research that has sought to identify the kinematic 
82 
patterns associated with many common soft tissue running injuries, including medial tibial 
83 
stress syndrome (MTSS)26, patellofemoral pain (PFP)32, 52, iliotibial band syndrome (ITBS)31 12 
84 
and Achilles tendinopathy (AT)39. Interestingly, many of these studies have reported similar 
85 
kinematic patterns to be associated with different running injuries. For example, increased 
86 
hip adduction has been associated with PFP32, 52 and ITBS31 12  and increased hip internal 
87 
rotation has been associated with PFP41 and MTSS26. Research has also suggested that due 
88 
to the kinematic coupling between the femur, knee and foot, increased hip adduction or hip 
89 
internal rotation may contribute to greater rearfoot eversion 2, 27, 38. Interestingly increased 
90 
rearfoot eversion has been associated with injuries such as MTSS 3, 50 and Achilles 
91 
tendinopathy.39  This research suggests that there may be a number of similar kinematic 
92 
patterns that could underlie multiple different soft tissue running injuries. It is possible that 
93 
these patterns could lead to elevated stress on multiple anatomical structures leading to 
94 
injury development at different areas. These kinematic patterns may represent global 
95 
contributors to injury.  
96 
Recent research supports the idea of biomechanical parameters that could be considered 
97 
global contributors to running injury. In a prospective study of 249 runners, Davis et al7 
98 
reported that runners who went on to develop a range of different injuries, demonstrated 
99 
significantly elevated vertical loading rates. While in a retrospective study which 
100 
investigated runners with AT and MTSS, Becker et al3 reported greater rearfoot eversion at 
101 
late stance phase, to be a characteristic consistently associated with injury. Although these 
102 
 6 
 
two studies provide preliminary evidence for the existence of global contributors to running 
103 
injury, Davis et al 7 did not include kinematic data, while Becker et al3 investigated only 
104 
MTSS and AT. Therefore, further research is required to understand whether there are 
105 
similar kinematic patterns that may underlie multiple different running injuries. This 
106 
understanding would be invaluable to clinicians as it could be used as a basis for both 
107 
screening techniques as well as preventative and rehabilitative programs.  
108 
The aim of this current study was to identify whether there are kinematic parameters that 
109 
may represent global kinematic contributors to running injury. To achieve this objective, we 
110 
sought to identify whether there are differences in running kinematics between a large 
111 
group of runners with common running injuries (ITBS, PFP, MTSS and AT) compared to a 
112 
healthy control group. We hypothesised that the pooled group of injured runners would 
113 
demonstrate greater contralateral pelvic drop, hip adduction and rearfoot eversion angles 
114 
when compared to injury free controls. We also hypothesised that these kinematic patterns 
115 
would be consistent amongst injury subgroups. 
116 
METHODS 
117 
Participants 
118 
A total of 108 runners were enrolled in this current study, including 72 injured runners (28 
119 
males, 44 females) and 36 healthy controls (15 males, 21 females) matched for age, height 
120 
and weight (Table 1). The injured group contained subgroups of 18 runners with PFP, ITBS, 
121 
MTSS and AT (Table 2). These injuries were selected as they are cited as the most prevalent 
122 
soft tissue overuse running injuries.24 An a priori sample size calculation was conducted 
123 
using data from a previous study reporting kinematic differences between healthy and 
124 
injured runners.32 Using g*power software, we calculated that we would need at least 98 
125 
 7 
 
people (65 injured) in order to detect an effect size of 0.75 with a power of 0.85 and a 
126 
critical α = 0.01. Participants were recruited via poster advertisements at local running clubs 
127 
and sports injury clinics. All participants provided written informed consent prior to 
128 
participation and ethical approval was obtained via the local ethics committee.

Inclusion/ Exclusion Criteria 
133 
Injured Group 
134 
The injured group included individuals with a current diagnosis of either PFP, ITBS, MTSS or 
135 
Achilles tendinopathy. Injury diagnosis was confirmed following a physical examination by a 
136 
qualified physiotherapist in accordance with previously published diagnostic criteria for 
137 
PFP,6 ITBS,17 MTSS54 and Achilles tendinopathy22 (Supplementary File 1). All participants 
138 
reported being able to run up to 10 minutes before the onset of pain and maximal pain 
139 
during running greater than 3/10 on a numerical rating scale (0 = no pain, 10 = worst 
140 
possible pain). Additionally, all participants reported they were not currently receiving 
141 
medical treatment for their injury and that their pain had caused a restriction to their 
142 
running volume and/or frequency for a minimum of 3 months. Previous research has 
143 
reported training factors such as increases in weekly training volume, to increase the risk of 
144 
injury. This is likely due to a sudden excessive rise in acute tissue stress on the 
145 
musculoskeletal system, resulting in insufficient time for adaptive changes33. Therefore, in 
146 
order to control for training errors as a cause of injury, participants were excluded if they 
147 
reported an increase in weekly training volume of greater than 30% proceeding the onset of 
148 
injury.  
149 
Control Group 
150 
 9 
 
Control participants were included if they reported running a minimum of 30 miles per week 
151 
for the last 18 months with no reported injury. Participants were excluded if they reported 
152 
any musculoskeletal ailment within the last 18 months that caused a restriction or cessation 
153 
of running, or any need to seek advice from a health care professional. Additional exclusion 
154 
criteria included previous history of overuse running injury, injury caused by another sport, 
155 
previous spinal injury or lower limb surgery. 
156 
Procedures 
157 
Kinematic data were collected from all participants whilst running on a treadmill at 3.2m/s 
158 
wearing their own running shoes. After a 5 minute warm up period, 30 seconds of kinematic 
159 
data were collected using a 12 camera Qualysis Oqus system (240Hz). A total of nine 
160 
anatomical segments were tracked following a previously published protocol by the same 
161 
authors shown to have good to excellent repeatability.28, 37 Segments included the thorax, 
162 
pelvis and bilateral thigh, shank and foot segments. In addition, a further rearfoot segment 
163 
was included using 3 non colinear markers attached to the heel of the participant’s shoes. 
164 
The foot segment was used to calculate sagittal plane ankle kinematics while the rearfoot 
165 
segment was used to calculate frontal plane foot kinematics. Further details of the markers 
166 
used to track each segment and the precise definition of the anatomical coordinate systems 
167 
is provided in supplementary file 2 and described in previous publications.14, 28, 37  
168 
Raw kinematic data were low pass filtered at 10Hz. Intersegmental kinematics, along with 
169 
the motions of the pelvis and thorax with respect to the laboratory system, were calculated 
170 
using a six degrees of freedom model using the commercial software Visual 3D (C-Motion). 
171 
Gait events were defined using a kinematic approach20 and subsequently used to segment 
172 
each kinematic signal into a minimum of 10 consecutive gait cycles. An ensemble average 
173 
 10 
 
for each signal was created and selected kinematic parameters derived from the ensemble 
174 
average curves. This latter processing was carried out using a custom Matlab script.  
175 
Data Analysis 
176 
A range of kinematic parameters at both initial contact and mid-stance were selected for 
177 
analysis. Parameters at initial contact included sagittal plane angles of the trunk, pelvis, hip, 
178 
knee and ankle as well as frontal plane angles of the trunk and rearfoot. Peak angles at mid 
179 
stance included sagittal and frontal plane angles of the trunk, pelvis, knee and ankle and 
180 
rearfoot as well as transverse plane angles of the hip and knee. Parameters were selected 
181 
based on previous research reporting differences between injured and non-injured 
182 
runners39, 41, 52. Peak angles at mid-stance were defined as the maximum joint angle 
183 
between initial contact and toe off. Foot strike patterns of each group were determined 
184 
based on the kinematic waveforms of the ankle joint. Where the ankle demonstrated an 
185 
immediate movement into plantarflexion, participants were classified as having a rearfoot 
186 
strike, participants demonstrating immediate ankle dorsiflexion were classified as a forefoot 
187 
strike. The injured leg was analysed from the injured runners, right or left leg was analysed 
188 
at random from the healthy runners in order to match the total distribution of right and left 
189 
legs in the injured group.   
190 
Statistical Analysis 
191 
Participant characteristics were analysed using independent t-tests for the healthy versus 
192 
injured group comparisons and a one-way ANOVA for the subgroup analysis (Table 1 & 2). 
193 
Chi-squared tests were used to assess for differences in distribution of foot strike patterns 
194 
between the groups. In order to identify possible global contributors to running injury we 
195 
used a two-phased approach. Firstly, data from the injured group were pooled and 
196 
 11 
 
kinematic parameters compared with those of the healthy group using an independent t-
197 
test. Secondly, for any variables found to be significant different following the injured versus 
198 
healthy comparison, we assessed for subgroup differences between the four injury 
199 
subgroups using a one-way ANOVA test and post hoc Least Significant Difference (LSD). In 
200 
order to be considered a global contributor to running injury, we required a kinematic 
201 
parameter to be consistent across the different injury groups. This ensured that differences 
202 
observed in the pooled injury data, were not the result of large effects in one of the injury 
203 
subgroups. Before analysis, all kinematic parameters were assessed for homogeneity of 
204 
variance and normal distribution using Levine’s test (p = >0.05) and Shapiro-Wilk (p = >0.05). 
205 
Where assumptions were not met, an equivalent non-parametric test was used. In order to 
206 
reduce the possibility of type I error, a critical α = 0.01 was used for injured versus healthy 
207 
comparisons. However, we used a critical α = 0.05 for the subgroup ANOVA analysis, due to 
208 
the smaller subgroup sample sizes. This was deemed appropriate given the smaller number 
209 
of group comparisons and therefore lower likelihood of type I error.  
210 
In addition to calculating statistical significance for group comparisons, we also calculated 
211 
effect sizes. For t-test comparisons, we used Cohen’s D and interpreted an effect size of 0.2, 
212 
0.5 and 0.8 as small, medium and large respectively.4 For the ANOVA comparisons, we used 
213 
the Eta squared statistic (η² = SS between groups/ SS total) and interpreted effect sizes of 
214 
0.01, 0.09 and 0.25 as small, medium and large respectively.4   
215 
Finally, a forward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis was conducted in order to 
216 
determine which kinematic parameters could predict classification into either the injured or 
217 
the healthy group. Parameters identified to be significantly different between healthy and 
218 
 12 
 
injured groups were considered for the regression model. Variables were excluded from the 
219 
regression model if they were found to demonstrate differences between injury subgroups.  
220 
 
221 
RESULTS 
222 
Injured versus Healthy 
223 
The pooled data showed the injured runners to land with significantly more knee extension 
224 
and ankle dorsiflexion (Table 3, Figure 2). At mid-stance, the injured runners were found to 
225 
have significantly greater forward trunk lean, CPD (Figure 1a) and hip adduction (Figure 1c & 
226 
3, Table 4). Large effect sizes of 1.37, 0.89 and 0.87 were observed for CPD, hip adduction 
227 
and knee flexion at initial contact respectively (Table 3 & 4). Trunk forward lean at mid-
228 
stance and ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact demonstrated moderate effect sizes of 0.65 
229 
and 0.71 respectively (Table 3 & 4). Chi-squared tests found no significant difference in the 
230 
distribution of foot strike patterns between the groups (p = 0.332). In the healthy group 
231 
there was a total of 17 forefoot and 19 rearfoot runners. In the Injured group there was a 
232 
total of 27 forefoot and 45 rearfoot runners.

Injury Subgroups 
248 
The subgroup ANOVA analysis was conducted in order to identify if there were differences 
249 
between injury subgroups for variables identified as being different between the pooled 
250 
injured and healthy groups. This analysis found no differences for ankle dorsiflexion and 
251 
knee flexion at initial contact (Table 5). Furthermore, there were no differences in peak 
252 
trunk forward lean and CPD during mid-stance (Table 5), indicating these parameters were 
253 
consistent across the injury subgroups. However there was a significant difference between 
254

Logistic Regression 
260 
The final variables identified as global kinematic contributors included knee flexion and 
261 
ankle dorsiflexion at initial contact as well as trunk forward lean and CPD at mid-stance. All 
262 
four variables were entered into the logistic regression model. The forward stepwise logistic 
263 
regression model identified that CPD at mid-stance (OR = 1.87; 95% CI: 1.41, 2.49; p = 
264 
<0.001) and knee flexion at initial contact (OR = 0.87; 95% CI: 0.78, 0.97; p = 0.012) were 
265 
significant predictors of classification as either healthy or injured, explaining 47% of the 
266 
variance in the data (R2 = 0.466). The most important predictor variable was CPD, with an 
267 
 17 
 
80% increase in the odds of being classified injured for every 1° increase in pelvic drop. For 
268 
knee flexion there was a 23% reduction in the odds of being classified injured for every 1° 
269 
increase in knee flexion at initial contact.  
270 
 
271 
DISCUSSION 
272 
This study identified a number of kinematic differences between the injured and healthy 
273 
runners that were consistent across injury subgroups. In particular the injured runners were 
274 
found to demonstrate significantly greater peak contralateral pelvic drop (CPD) and forward 
275 
trunk lean, as well as a more extended knee and dorsiflexed ankle at initial contact (Table 3, 
276 
4 & 5) (Figures 2 & 3). We found CPD to be the most important predictor variable when 
277 
classifying runners as healthy or injured. These kinematic patterns may represent global 
278 
kinematic contributors to soft tissue running injuries and together may define a pathological 
279 
running gait.

288 
Global kinematic contributors 
289 
Peak contralateral pelvic drop was found to be the kinematic parameter most strongly 
290 
associated with running injury. Previous studies have associated CPD with PFP52 and MTSS,26 
291 
however this study identified increased CPD amongst multiple different running related 
292 
injuries, including ITBS and Achilles tendinopathy (Figure 1b). Therefore, CPD may represent 
293 
a global kinematic contributor and risk factor for many common soft tissue running injures. 
294 
It is likely that CPD will influence lower limb tissue stress at a number of different 
295 
anatomical sites through a number of different mechanisms. For example, Tateuchi et al43 
296 
identified that increasing CPD resulted in an increase in iliotibial band tension at the lateral 
297 
femoral condyle. This will likely influence ITBS development through increased strain rate 19 
298 
and increased compression between the ITB and lateral femoral condyle11. At the same 
299 
time, an increase in ITB tension will result in a lateral displacement of the patella.29 Lateral 
300 
displacement of the patella will lead to a rise in patellofemoral joint stress, leading to PFP 
301 
development,36 while at the lower limb, increased CPD will result in a medial shift in the 
302 
ground reaction force relative to the knee joint centre.37, 42 This may alter the force 
303 
 19 
 
distribution through the lower limb, leading to increased bending forces on the medial tibia5 
304 
and potentially alter pressure distribution through the foot. This may contribute to the 
305 
development of either MTSS or AT. 25, 50   
306 
 
307 
One possible explanation for the increased CPD observed in the injured group could be due 
308 
to reduced strength or neuromuscular function at the hip. Previous authors have reported 
309 
delayed onset of gluteus medius and maximus in runners with PFP51 and AT15, while others 
310 
have reported reduced hip abductor strength in runners with ITBS16, PFP41, AT18 and MTSS48. 
311 
The hip abductors, in particular the gluteus medius, are thought to control frontal plane 
312 
kinematics of the pelvis and hip40. Therefore, it is conceivable that reduced strength or 
313 
neuromuscular function of the gluteus medius would lead to an inability to stabilise the 
314 
pelvis in the frontal plane, causing increased CPD.  
315 
 
316 
We also found the injured runners to land with greater knee extension and ankle 
317 
dorsiflexion (Table 3, Figure 2), which may influence tissue stress in a number of ways. 
318 
Firstly, in knee extension the patella becomes vulnerable to lateral tilt and displacement 
319 
which may influence patellofemoral contact areas and joint stress during early stance35. 
320 
Secondly, an extended knee and dorsiflexed ankle at initial contact is typically associated 
321 
with a greater distance between the centre of mass and the foot at contact. Greater 
322 
distance between the centre of mass and foot, as well as larger ankle dorsiflexion angles, 
323 
have been associated with increased knee joint loading and breaking impulse49. An 
324 
extended knee at initial contact has also been reported to reduce the ability to attenuate 
325 
impact forces during early stance8. Collectively it seems plausible that the extended lower 
326 
 20 
 
limb posture at initial contact may influence impact loading and knee joint loading during 
327 
early stance.  
328 
 
329 
One possible mechanism explaining the differences in forward trunk lean may be due to 
330 
strength deficits around the gluteals and paraspinals. Previous studies have reported fatigue 
331 
of the paraspinal and gluteal muscles to be associated with an increase in trunk forward 
332 
lean during running21 and drop landings23. Therefore, reduced strength capacity of the 
333 
gluteals and paraspinals may result in an inability to maintain an upright running posture 
334 
amongst the injured runners. 
335 
 
336 
Kinematic Subgroups 
337 
While hip adduction was found to be greater amongst the pooled injured group, the 
338 
subgroup analysis revealed this parameter differed across the injury subgroups (Table 5, 
339 
Figure 1c & 1d). Specifically, we found hip adduction to be greater amongst subgroups of 
340 
runners with PFP and MTSS compared to the ITBS subgroup (Figure 1d). This finding is in 
341 
contrast to previous studies by Noehren et al31 and Ferber et al 12 who reported increased 
342 
hip adduction amongst runners with ITBS. One potential reason for the contrasting findings 
343 
may be due to sex differences between studies. Hip adduction has been reported to be 
344 
influenced by sex subgroups52 with greater hip adduction amongst female runners. In the 
345 
current study we included a mix of males and females while Noehren et al 31 and Ferber et 
346 
al 12 only included female participants.  While we acknowledge that hip adduction may be 
347 
an important kinematic risk factor for certain injuries, we feel our data suggests hip 
348 
 21 
 
adduction may be more influential in specific subsets of runners and pathologies, rather 
349 
than others.  
350 
 
351 
Limitations 
352 
One limitation is that the study was retrospective and therefore it is not possible to 
353 
conclude if the observed kinematic patterns are the cause of injury, or the result of injury. 
354 
Nevertheless, we ensured that all data were recorded before the onset of pain to minimise 
355 
any possible effect of pain on the observed kinematic patterns. However we cannot rule out 
356 
the possibility that participants may have adapted their running kinematics in response to 
357 
chronic injury or in apprehension of the acute onset of pain. Therefore, we acknowledge 
358 
that future prospective studies are required to further investigate whether the kinematic 
359 
patterns observed within the current study are the cause or effect of injury. Another study 
360 
limitation is the higher weekly mileage of the control group (Table 1). However, we feel that 
361 
this could be considered a strength, as previous research suggests running greater than 40 
362 
miles per week is a risk factor for developing injury.46 On average, our healthy control group 
363 
were exceeding this threshold for more than 18 months prior to testing yet remained injury 
364 
free. Therefore, we feel the control group may be representative of a healthy running gait in 
365 
order to remain injury free at training loads exceeding the previously reported injury 
366 
threshold. It is also important to note that this study was limited to a select number of 
367 
common soft tissue running injuries and therefore these results may not apply to other 
368 
injuries such as plantar heel pain, stress fractures and muscle strains. Further research 
369 
would be required in order to establish a link between the identified kinematic patterns and 
370 
other running related injuries.   
371 
 22 
 
Clinical Relevance 
372 
The findings from the present study may have a number of clinical implications. Firstly, all of 
373 
the identified kinematic parameters can be easily visualised using two dimensional gait 
374 
analysis methods9, 10, 34 (Figures 2 & 3). A number of recent publications have shown 2D 
375 
assessments of CPD, hip adduction, trunk forward lean and sagittal plane knee and ankle 
376 
angles to be highly correlated with 3D measurement systems and to demonstrate high intra 
377 
and inter-tester reliability 9, 10, 34. Therefore, it should be possible to use 2D measurement 
378 
techniques to assess the biomechanical parameters which were associated with injury in 
379 
this study. Secondly, many of the identified global kinematic contributors to injury, can be 
380 
modified through gait retraining. For example, CPD and hip adduction angles can be 
381 
retrained using mirror feedback,53 while knee and ankle angles are influenced by increasing 
382 
cadence or modifying foot strike patterns.30 Therefore, this study highlights a number of key 
383 
kinematics that can be considered global contributors to running injury and can be easily 
384 
assessed and modified in clinical practice. This may assist clinicians in the development of 
385 
rehabilitation programs for common running related injuries.  
386 
CONCLUSION 
387 
This study identified a number of global kinematic contributors to common running injuries. 
388 
In particular, we found injured runners to run with greater peak contralateral pelvic drop 
389 
and trunk forward lean, as well as an extended knee and dorsiflexed ankle at initial contact. 
390 
Contralateral pelvic drop appears to be the variable most strongly associated with common 
391 
running related injuries. The kinematic patterns identified as global contributors to injury 
392 
can be easily assessed and modified in clinical practice.
