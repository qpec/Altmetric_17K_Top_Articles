Abstract
Background: Intensive lifestyle change can treat and even reverse type 2 diabetes. Digital therapeutics have the potential to
deliver lifestyle as medicine for diabetes at scale.
Objective: This 12-week study investigates the effects of a novel digital therapeutic, FareWell, on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
and diabetes medication use.
Methods: 
Adults with type 2 diabetes and a mobile phone were recruited throughout the United States using Facebook
advertisements. The intervention aim was to effect a sustainable shift to a plant-based dietary pattern and regular exercise by
advancing culinary literacy and lifestyle skill acquisition. The intervention was delivered by an app paired with specialized human
support, also delivered digitally. Health coaching was provided every 2 weeks by telephone, and a clinical team was available
for participants requiring additional support. Participants self-reported current medications and HbA1c at the beginning and end
of the 12-week program. Self-efficacy related to managing diabetes and maintaining dietary changes was assessed via survey.
Engagement was recorded automatically through the app.
Results: We enrolled 118 participants with a baseline HbA1c >6.5%. Participants were 81.4% female (96/118) and resided in
38 US states with a mean age of 50.7 (SD 9.4) years, baseline body mass index of 38.1 (SD 8.8) kg/m2, and baseline HbA1c of
8.1% (SD 1.6). At 12 weeks, 86.2% (94/109) of participants were still using the app. Mean change in HbA1c was –0.8% (97/101,
SD 1.3, P<.001) for those reporting end-study data. For participants with a baseline HbA1c >7.0% who did not change medications
midstudy, HbA1c change was –1.1% (67/69, SD 1.4, P<.001). The proportion of participants with an end-study HbA1c <6.5%
was 28% (22/97). After completion of the intervention, 17% (16/97) of participants reported a decrease in diabetic medication
while 8% (8/97) reported an increase. A total of 57% (55/97) of participants achieved a composite outcome of reducing HbA1c,
reducing diabetic medication use, or both; 92% (90/98) reported greater confidence in their ability to manage their diabetes
compared to before the program, and 91% (89/98) reported greater confidence in their ability to maintain a healthy dietary pattern.
Participants engaged with the app an average of 4.3 times per day. We observed a significantly greater decrease in HbA1c among
participants in the highest tertile of app engagement compared to those in the lowest tertile of app engagement (P=.03).
Conclusions: Clinically meaningful reductions in HbA1c were observed with use of the FareWell digital therapeutic. Greater
glycemic control was observed with increasing app engagement. Engagement and retention were both high in this widely distributed
sample.

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes prevalence is at pandemic levels and continues
to rise here in the United States and globally [1,2]. Medication
costs are rising in parallel and threaten to bankrupt national
health systems [3,4]. Despite increased use of medications and
the advent of new pharmacological treatments, glycemic control
among those with diabetes does not appear to be improving
since 2010 [5].
While type 2 diabetes is currently considered a chronic
progressive disease that typically requires increasing medications
over time [6], there is also growing evidence that type 2 diabetes
is treatable, and in some cases reversible, with comprehensive
lifestyle changes alone [7-15]. Therapeutic lifestyle changes
include substantial improvements in dietary pattern, activity,
and exercise; avoidance of tobacco and excess alcohol; and
additional behaviors that improve sleep, stress, mood, and social
connection [9,13,16].
The practice of leveraging therapeutic lifestyle changes as
medicine is often referred to as lifestyle medicine. The case for
lifestyle as medicine has been detailed elsewhere and applies
not just to type 2 diabetes but to many other lifestyle-related
chronic diseases, which collectively account for roughly 80%
of premature mortality and health care costs [16-19].
An intervention that successfully delivers lifestyle therapy has
potential benefits over traditional therapeutics like medications
and surgery. Potential benefits include a more favorable
side-effect profile due to fewer adverse effects and additional
non–disease-specific health benefits, lowered health care costs,
and for many, greater acceptability [16-19].
Lifestyle 
therapy 
has 
been 
shown 
to 
outperform
pharmacotherapy in diabetes prevention [20,21] although the
challenge of translating that result to real-world populations
persists [22,23]. For diabetes reversal, there is similar
opportunity but less clarity about the preferred approach [10,15],
and thus there are few widely accessible, cost-effective therapies
available [16]. Digital therapeutics that deliver lifestyle therapy
have potential to fill this therapeutic void because they are
inherently scalable therapies that can be accessed outside of
traditional brick-and-mortar constraints (ie, wherever a patient
goes, at any moment in time).
A digital therapeutic has been described as an intervention for
treating disease that is delivered continuously through digital
means [24,25]. This study examines a digital therapeutic, called
FareWell, that aims to effect a sustainable shift to a whole food,
plant-based dietary pattern and regular exercise by advancing
culinary literacy and lifestyle skill acquisition. It incorporates
interactive mobile computing (ie, an app), remote sensors (eg,
wearable devices and home monitors), and human care (eg,
health coaching) delivered by digital means. This solution
affords for population management and specialized care that
can be made accessible to adults living in a vast geography, at
scale. As envisioned, it is intended as a stand-alone intervention
that could replace or complement other interventions.
In this study, we sought to understand to what degree a novel,
skill-focused, digital therapeutic could change HbA1c and
antidiabetic medication use in a geographically widely
distributed sample of adults with type 2 diabetes. While the
ultimate goal of the intervention is to be more cost effective
than other interventions, this study examines effectiveness alone.
Methods
Trial Design and Participants
We conducted a 12-week, nonblinded, single-arm interventional
study in a convenience sample of adults with a self-reported
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
Participants were recruited online through advertisements listed
on Facebook and to a lesser extent Craigslist, targeted to adults
in any US state with an interest in type 2 diabetes. The study
was described as evaluating a free 3-month lifestyle change
program that uses digital tools, a plant-based dietary pattern,
and health coaching.
Eligibility criteria included having a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes,
age 18 years or older, and possession of an Android or iPhone
mobile phone as demonstrated by the ability to download the
intervention app. Type 2 diabetes status was presumed by the
combination of a self-reported diagnosis and an initial HbA1c
of 6.5% or higher. Participants were excluded if they were not
able to comply with the study protocol—for example, if they
could not speak or read English or did not have sufficient
computer literacy to operate the app successfully.
Enrollment was on a first-come-first-served basis and all data
collection occurred online via electronic survey or directly
through the app. Participants who were interested in the study
were invited to download the app and enter a code to unlock
the app. Participants were then instructed by the app to create
an account using their email address. Upon creating an account,
participants were emailed an informed consent document to
review. Informed consent was obtained for each study
participant via discussion with a study staff member prior to
commencing their first coaching call. This phone call with study
staff also ensured that each participant was unique.
An incentive of US $200 was offered to participants who
participated in the program and completed data reporting at 3
months. The study was approved and overseen by Quorum
Review Institutional Review Board [26], an independent ethics
review board located in Seattle, Washington.
Intervention App Development
The intervention app was developed by a San Francisco–based
startup of which the authors are founders and/or employees or
scientific consultants. The first version of the app was developed
as a Web app using responsive design and validated with
usability testing, followed by a pilot clinical trial in adults with

 class 1 obesity and elevated risk for metabolic disease [27]. It
was then redeveloped as a native app for Android and iOS using
human-centered software design principles [28] and subject to
basic usability testing prior to the start of this study.
Periodic updates of the app were released during the study
period. Study participants enrolled using version 1.3 of the app
and completed the study on version 1.5. The vast majority of
the changes in the app during the study period were minor
experience improvements or bug fixes. One new feature—an
artificially intelligent conversational bot—was released in the
last month of the study in v1.5 along with the ability to enter
home finger-stick readings. This bot enabled a new method for
participants to report meals eaten and visualize the number of
healthy meals eaten each week.
Intervention
The digital therapeutic consists of use of the intervention app
paired with specialized human support, also delivered digitally.
The content design of both app and human support incorporated
evidenced-based dietary and lifestyle recommendations such
as a dietary pattern consisting mainly of whole food plant-based
meals and regular exercise meeting or exceeding national
guidelines [9,13,19]. Since it is known that increased meals
prepared at home is associated with decreased disease burden
[29], additional content was developed with expert input to
enhance culinary skill acquisition with the aim of increasing
meals prepared at home.
Several theoretical models informed the design of app features,
including the theory of planned behavior (eg, features were
designed to alter intentions), social cognitive theory (eg, features
were designed to enhance self-efficacy, enable experiential
learning, and reinforce healthy behaviors), and behavioral
economics (eg, use of default choices). Both the app and
accompanying human support are designed as a learning
platform, which aims to impart the lifestyle skills necessary to
reverse cardiometabolic disease.
The app was designed primarily to facilitate the learning and
adoption of plant-based meals, self-monitoring habits, and
scheduling of coaching calls. It is intended to be used ad libitum,
but expectations of use were established during the informed
consent process as follows:
Use of the meal planning feature that facilitates advanced
planning of meals and automated shopping lists (approximately
5 minutes per week). The meal planning feature uses default
recipes that met prespecified criteria for ease-of-preparation,
inclusion of easy-to-access, whole food, plant-based ingredients,
and staged introduction of culinary techniques. Participants
could easily swap meals or plan to eat a meal not in the recipe
database. An interactive shopping list was autopopulated
whenever a meal plan was created or modified.
Self-monitoring of weight daily (via digitally connected scale
provided free to participants or by self-report in app) and the
option of reporting meals made (approximately 1 to 2 minutes
per day).
Reviewing of educational materials aimed at advancing culinary
or health literacy (approximately 15 to 20 minutes per week).
An optional, private Facebook community was created to
provide additional peer-to-peer and expert-to-peer support (ad
libitum).
The app delivered reminders—for example, to schedule a
coaching call or report meals made or eaten—in the form of
in-app notifications and an ability to message the participant’s
health coach.
The primary form of human support was delivered by 30-minute
telephonic health coaching calls, scheduled at the participant’s
convenience every 2 weeks via the study app. Health coaching
is an evidence-based practice grounded in behavior change
theory that uses guided conversational techniques such as
motivational interviewing [30,31]. All study health coaches had
completed training from accredited health coaching institutions
and received additional training in lifestyle and culinary
medicine, research methods, and training for coaching within
a clinical team prior to the start of the study.
Health coaching calls were used to set and review personalized
behavioral goals with each participant. These goals centered
largely on the attainment of dietary skills and repetition for habit
formation but also included setting physical activity goals and
addressing barriers to these goals. For example, participants
worked with their coach to establish an individualized plan to
progressively reach or exceed a goal of 30 minutes of moderately
intense physical activity per day.
During the intervention period, the health coaches were
supported by a specialized team of lifestyle medicine experts
including 
a 
nurse 
practitioner, 
internist, 
psychiatrist,
chef-educator, and registered dietitian who were also available
to speak to members on an as-needed basis via a care-escalation
process. Participants were asked to continue managing all
medications with their primary care team or endocrinologist
during the course of the study.
Measures
Demographics
Participants reported age, gender, height, weight, and US state
of residence as a part of the sign-up process for the study app.
Hemoglobin A1c and Medication Use
Most recent HbA1c and current diabetic medication use (name,
dose, and frequency of medication) were self-reported in the
study app by participants. Participants were encouraged by their
coaches to report any changes to medications within their study
app. In addition to in-app coach messages, email reminders
were used to prompt entry of a follow-up HbA1c and updated
medications at 12 weeks. Medication and HbA1c data were
reviewed by 2 study authors (NLG, MAB). Participants were
contacted by study staff (KLE, NLG) to help clarify potential
reporting errors.
Engagement
Engagement with both the study app and coaching calls was
measured automatically via the study app. Total engagement is
defined as the average number of recorded app actions per day

 (eg, planning or reporting meals, scheduling calls, building
shopping lists).
Satisfaction
All participants were invited to fill out a Net Promoter Score
(NPS) survey [32] at week 10 after sign-up. The NPS consists
of 1 question “How likely are you to recommend FareWell to
a friend?” rated on a 10-point scale (0-6=detractors,
7-8=passives, 9-10=promoters). The NPS is calculated by
subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of
promoters.
Self-Efficacy
End of program self-efficacy to manage diabetes and maintain
an optimal dietary pattern was measured via online survey
questions using a Likert scale; survey was emailed to
participants during their 12th week.
Statistical Methods
Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version
9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). Change over time of continuous
variables was analyzed using 2-tailed paired Student t tests with
alpha set at .05 and chi-square tests for differences in categorical
variables. The McNemar test was used to evaluate medication
change.
To evaluate the combined effects of medication and HbA1c
change, we calculated a composite outcome measure defined
as a decrease in diabetic medication use without an increase in
HbA1c or an improvement in HbA1c of at least 0.5% without an
increase in diabetic medication use.
We used mixed-effects modeling to test the effects of baseline
body mass index (BMI), years since diagnosis of diabetes, net
change in diabetes medications, total app engagement, and
baseline HbA1c on the mean change in HbA1c. To evaluate the
intent-to-treat effect, we used a last-value-carried-forward
approach for the missing data from participants who did not
report follow-up HbA1c levels. Since effect-size can be
modulated by baseline HbA1c [33], we also tested the effects of
a log transformed HbA1c.
To investigate the relationship between engagement with the
program and HbA1c, we first defined tertiles of app engagement
using the sum of all actions taken in the app during the study.
A general linear regression was used to test the effect of app
use tertile with the change in HbA1c. Change in HbA1c was set
as the dependent variable with tertile of app engagement and
the log transformed baseline HbA1c as independent variables.
Using the least square means pairwise comparison, we tested
the differences in changes in HbA1c by the tertiles of app
engagement.
Results
Participants
A total of 123 individuals with self-reported type 2 diabetes and
an initial HbA1c of 6.5% or higher downloaded the intervention
app, of which 118 (95.9% of downloads) consented to
participation in the study. Of the consented participants, 113
were recruited from Facebook and 5 from Craigslist. There were
9 dropouts (7.6% of consented) during the study. Reasons for
dropping out were participant not feeling ready to make lifestyle
changes (5), difficulty using the app (2), and no reason given
(2). Of the remaining 109 participants, 94 (86.2%) were still
using the app at 12 weeks, and 101 (92.7%) provided some or
all end-study data.
There were no adverse events observed thought to be related to
the study intervention. However, 2 adverse events were reported
during the first month of study period. One participant reported
suicidal ideations to a coach, and another participant was
hospitalized briefly for dehydration after a flu-like illness. Both
participants recovered fully from their events and were able to
continue participating in the study.
Baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Participants
from 38 US states consented to participate; 81.4% (96/118)
were female, with a mean age of 50.7 (SD 9.4) years, mean
BMI of 38.1 (SD 8.8) kg/m2, and mean HbA1c of 8.1% (SD 1.6)
at baseline. There were no statistical differences in baseline
characteristics between those who consented and those who
submitted end-study data.

 Hemoglobin A1c
Among participants who reported an end-study HbA1c, 80%
(78/97) had improvement of HbA1c, with 59% (57/97) having
a decrease of 0.5% or more, 39% (38/97) having a decrease of
1% or more, and 23% (22/97) having a follow-up HbA1c <6.5%.
The mean change was –0.8% (SD 1.3, P<.001) over a mean
interval of 3.5 (SD 0.9) months. This change remained
statistically significant in our mixed-effects model (P=.003).
Substituting the log transformed baseline HbA1c, we found that
the impact of baseline HbA1c was modulated and the significance
of the mean change in HbA1c was improved (P<.001). Using a
last-value-carried-forward approach for the missing data from
participants who did not report follow-up HbA1c levels, the
mean change remained statistically significant (118/118, –0.6%,
SD 0.9, P<.001).
Among those with a baseline HbA1c >7%, the mean change was
–1.0% (n=69, SD 1.4, P<.001). Excluding those who
experienced a change in glycemic medication midstudy (2/69),
the mean change in HbA1c was –1.1% (67/69, SD 1.4, P<.001).
Medication Use
At the start of the study, participants reported taking an average
of 1.4 (SD 0.9) diabetic medications with a self-reported average
time since diagnosis of 2.6 (SD 1.6) years. Of those reporting
follow-up medication data, 4% (4/97) changed medications or
dosages within the 12-week study (ie, their medication changes
were likely to impact follow-up HbA1c). In conjunction with
reporting an end-study HbA1c, 17% (16/97) of participants
reported decreasing or stopping 1 or more diabetic medications
and 8% (8/97) increased or added 1 or more diabetic
medications. The frequency of decreased medication use (either
decreasing dose or stopping a medication) compared to baseline
medication use was statistically significant (P<.001).
Using the composite outcome measure defined above, 57% of
participants (55/97) met the composite outcome of reducing
HbA1c, reducing diabetic medication use, or both.
Program Engagement and Satisfaction
Of the individuals who consented to participate, 92.4%
(109/118) were active in the study at the end of the 12-week
intervention period and 86.2% (94/109) were still using the app.
Total distinct app engagements averaged 4.3 (SD 2.5) per day,
and average number of coaching calls completed was 4.1 (SD
1.8) during the 12-week period.
We explored the relationship between app use and HbA1c
change. There was a stepwise decrease in HbA1c as app
engagement level increased. For example, as displayed in Figure
1, in those with a baseline HbA1c >7.0% who did not change
medications during the study period, the lowest tertile of
engagers reduced HbA1c by 0.9% (SD 1.3), whereas the highest
tertile of engagers reduced HbA1c by 1.3% (SD 1.0, P=.03 using
log transformed baseline HbA1c).
The NPS survey was completed by 47.7% (52/109) of
participants with 82.7% (43/52) of respondents giving a
promoter score (9 or 10), 11.5% (6/52) a neutral score (7 or 8),
and 5.8% (3/52) a detractor score (6 or below). The calculated
NPS was 76.9%.

Discussion
Principal Findings
In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a digital
therapeutic delivered to participants with type 2 diabetes
distributed across the United States. We found clinically
meaningful reductions in both HbA1c and the proportion of
participants who reduced diabetic medication use at the
conclusion of the 12-week study period. We also observed
greater glycemic control in participants with higher levels of
engagement with the app.
The magnitude of HbA1c reduction observed was comparable
to those found with commonly prescribed medications [33,34]
and successful intensive lifestyle interventions delivered in
person [10]. In addition, a meaningful percentage (28%, 22/97)
of participants achieved an HbA1c value below the diabetic
range, 23% (5/22) of whom reported no diabetic medication
use, indicating potential for partial or complete remission of
diabetes as defined by the American Diabetes Association
consensus definition [35]. However, the short duration of this
trial and lack of knowledge of the temporal sequence of lab test
versus medication change does not allow us to evaluate
remission status.
While this study supports the findings of others [36,37] who
have demonstrated the efficacy of digital health apps, this is the
first digital therapeutic study to our knowledge that emphasized
a skill-building process according to the principles of lifestyle
medicine rather than calorie or macronutrient counting or
restrictions, meal replacements, or mandatory finger-stick
monitoring. This is important because many situations that are
not conducive to long-term health can ameliorate glycemic
measures in the short term, among them starvation and serious
infectious disease [38]. Part of the novelty of this intervention
was use of a lifestyle approach to treat and reverse diabetes in
the short term that is known to be compatible with overall health
[18,19] and diabetes prevention [20,21] in the long term.
Strengths and Limitations
The main limitations of this study stem from its single sample,
nonrandomized design, self-selection of participants, and
reliance on self-reported biometrics. As such, this study cannot
establish causation nor can it rule out all potential confounders.
In addition, in this short duration study, we did not
independently quantify exercise or calorie-nutrient profiles and
therefore cannot comment on the precise mechanisms of action.
The strength of this study is a design that closely mirrors
real-world implementation of the intervention. The same clinical
team and processes used in the study are used in real-world
implementation of this digital therapeutic. And just like in the
real world, the app continued to develop and experience bugs
and bug fixes during the course of the study. This pragmatic
study design in concert with recruitment of participants in 38
US states suggests generalizable findings. Other strengths of
this study include high rates of retention and successful data
collection.
Conclusions
Future research in the form of randomized controlled trials will
be needed to establish comparative effectiveness. In addition,

 longer duration trials will be needed to assess the durability of
the lifestyle, biometric, and medication changes observed among
diverse socioeconomic populations. Equally important will be
research evaluating cost effectiveness. Finally, because this
study evaluated an early version of a rapidly evolving digital
therapeutic, it will be important to understand to what degree
feature enhancements and additions modify the outcomes
observed in this study.
