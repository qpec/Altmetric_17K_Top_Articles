Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious birth 
defects, including microcephaly and brain abnormalities (1). 
Population-based birth defects surveillance systems are critical 
to monitor all infants and fetuses with birth defects potentially 
related to Zika virus infection, regardless of known exposure or 
laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy. 
CDC analyzed data from 15 U.S. jurisdictions conducting 
population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially 
related to Zika virus infection.* Jurisdictions were stratified 
into the following three groups: those with 1) documented 
local transmission of Zika virus during 2016; 2) one or more 
cases of confirmed, symptomatic, travel-associated Zika virus 
disease reported to CDC per 100,000 residents; and 3) less 
than one case of confirmed, symptomatic, travel-associated 
Zika virus disease reported to CDC per 100,000 residents. A 
total of 2,962 infants and fetuses (3.0 per 1,000 live births; 
95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.9–3.2) (2) met the case 
definition.† In areas with local transmission there was a non-
statistically significant increase in total birth defects potentially 
related to Zika virus infection from 2.8 cases per 1,000 live 
* With population-based surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika 
virus infection, information is collected on all infants who have birth defects that 
might be related to Zika virus infection. This includes infants who have not been 
exposed to Zika virus and might have the same birth defects for other reasons. 
This helps to identify the full spectrum of outcomes associated with Zika virus 
infection. https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/research/birth-defects.html.
† Brain abnormalities or microcephaly (congenital microcephaly [head 
circumference <3rd percentile for gestational age and sex], intracranial 
calcifications, cerebral atrophy, abnormal cortical gyral patterns [e.g., 
polymicrogyria, lissencephaly, pachygyria, schizencephaly, and gray matter 
heterotopia], corpus callosum abnormalities, cerebellar abnormalities, 
porencephaly, hydranencephaly, ventriculomegaly/hydrocephaly [excluding 
“mild” ventriculomegaly without other brain abnormalities], fetal brain 
disruption sequence [collapsed skull, overlapping sutures, prominent occipital 
bone, and scalp rugae], and other major brain abnormalities); neural tube defects 
and other early brain malformations (anencephaly/acrania, encephalocele, spina 
bifida, and holoprosencephaly); structural eye abnormalities (microphthalmia/
anophthalmia, coloboma, cataract, intraocular calcifications, and chorioretinal 
anomalies [e.g., atrophy and scarring, gross pigmentary changes, excluding 
retinopathy of prematurity]; optic nerve atrophy, pallor, and other optic nerve 
abnormalities); consequences of central nervous system dysfunction 
(arthrogryposis, club foot with associated brain abnormalities, congenital hip 
dysplasia with associated brain abnormalities, and congenital sensorineural 
hearing loss).
births in the first half of 2016 to 3.0 cases in the second half 
(p = 0.10). However, when neural tube defects  and other early 
brain malformations (NTDs)§ were excluded, the prevalence of 
birth defects strongly linked to congenital Zika virus infection 
increased significantly, from 2.0 cases per 1,000 live births in 
the first half of 2016 to 2.4 cases in the second half, an increase 
of 29 more cases than expected (p = 0.009). These findings 
underscore the importance of surveillance for birth defects 
potentially related to Zika virus infection and the need for 
continued monitoring in areas at risk for Zika.
In 2016, as part of the emergency response to the Zika virus 
outbreak in the World Health Organization’s Region of the 
Americas, population-based birth defects surveillance systems 
monitored fetuses and infants with birth defects potentially 
related to Zika virus infection using a standard case definition 
and multiple data sources. Medical records were abstracted 
for data on birth defects, congenital infections, pregnancy 
outcome, head circumference, vital status, and Zika labora-
tory test results, irrespective of maternal Zika virus exposure 
or infection. Verbatim text describing the birth defects was 
reviewed to identify those that met the case definition. Infants 
and fetuses were aggregated into four mutually exclusive cat-
egories: those with 1) brain abnormalities or microcephaly; 
2) NTDs; 3) eye abnormalities without mention of a brain 
abnormality included in the two previously defined categories; 
and 4) other consequences of central nervous system (CNS) 
dysfunction, specifically joint contractures and congenital sen-
sorineural deafness without mention of brain or eye abnormali-
ties included in another category. Because the evidence linking 
NTDs and congenital Zika virus infection is weak, prevalence 
estimates per 1,000 live births were calculated both overall and 
excluding NTDs for each quarter in 2016; CIs were calculated 
using Poisson regression (1,2).
§ Neural tube defects and other early brain malformations are included as 
biologically plausible birth defects; however, they have been reported much less 
frequently with Zika virus infection than have defects in the other categories.

All 15 U.S. jurisdictions¶ included in this report had existing 
birth defects surveillance systems that were rapidly adapted to 
monitor birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection. 
These jurisdictions provided data on live births and pregnancy 
losses occurring from January 1–December 31, 2016. The 
jurisdictions were stratified into the following three groups: 
those with 1) confirmed local Zika virus transmission during 
2016**; 2) one or more cases of confirmed, symptomatic, 
travel-associated Zika virus disease reported to CDC per 
100,000 residents (i.e., “higher” Zika prevalence)††; and 3) less 
than one case per 100,000 residents of confirmed, symptom-
atic, travel-associated Zika virus disease reported to CDC (i.e., 
“lower” [low or no travel-associated] Zika prevalence)§§ (3).
Overall, 2,962 infants and fetuses with birth defects poten-
tially related to Zika virus infection were identified (3.0 per 
1,000 live births; CI = 2.9–3.2) (Table), including 1,457 (49%) 
with brain abnormalities or microcephaly, 581 (20%) with 
NTDs, 262 (9%) with eye abnormalities without mention of 
a brain abnormality, and 662 (22%) with other consequences 
of CNS dysfunction without mention of brain or eye abnor-
malities. Among the 2,962 infants and fetuses with defects 
potentially related to Zika virus infection, there were 2,716 
(92%) live births. Laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus 
infection in maternal, placental, infant, or fetal specimens was 
present in 45 (1.5%) cases; 96 (3.2%) had negative tests for 
Zika virus, and 2,821 (95.2%) either had no testing performed 
or no results available.
The prevalence of reported birth defects cases potentially 
related to Zika virus infection increased in jurisdictions with 
confirmed local transmission, from 2.8 per 1,000 live births 
(182 cases) during the first half of 2016 to 3.0 per 1,000 live 
births (211 cases) during the second half (CI = 2.4-3.2 and 
CI = 2.6–3.4, respectively; p = 0.10). In “higher” Zika preva-
lence jurisdictions, the monitored birth defects prevalence was 
3.0 per 1,000 live births in both the first (753 cases) and second 
(775 cases) halves of 2016. In “lower” prevalence jurisdictions, 
the monitored birth defects prevalence declined significantly 
from 3.4 per 1,000 live births (549 cases) during the first

Summary
What is already known about this topic?
Data collected from three U.S. population-based birth defects 
surveillance systems from 2013 and 2014, before the introduc-
tion of Zika virus infection in the World Health Organization’s 
Region of the Americas, showed a baseline prevalence of birth 
defects potentially related to congenital Zika virus infection of 
2.9 per 1,000 live births. Based on 2016 data from the U.S. Zika 
Pregnancy and Infant Registry, the risk for birth defects 
potentially related to Zika virus infection in pregnancies with 
laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection was 
approximately 20-fold higher than the baseline prevalence.
What is added by this report?
This report provides the first comprehensive data on the 
prevalence of birth defects (3.0 per 1,000 live births) potentially 
related to Zika virus infection in a birth cohort of nearly 
1 million births in 2016. A significant increase in birth defects 
strongly related to Zika virus during the second half of 2016 
compared with the first half was observed in jurisdictions with 
local Zika virus transmission. Only a small percentage of birth 
defects potentially related to Zika had laboratory evidence of 
Zika virus infection, and most were not tested for Zika virus.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Whereas the U.S. Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry monitors 
women with laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus infection 
during pregnancy and their congenitally exposed infants, 
population-based birth defects surveillance systems make a 
unique contribution by identifying and monitoring all cases of 
these birth defects regardless of exposure or laboratory testing 
or results. Continued surveillance for birth defects potentially 
related to Zika virus infection is important because most 
pregnancies affected by Zika virus ended in 2017. These data 
will help communities plan for needed resources to care for 
affected patients and families and can serve as a foundation for 
linking and evaluating health and developmental outcomes of 
affected children.
half of 2016 to 3.0 (492 cases) per 1,000 live births during 
the second half (CI = 3.2–3.7 and CI = 2.8–3.3, respectively; 
p = 0.002) (Figure 1).
When NTDs were excluded, the prevalence of birth defects 
potentially related to Zika virus infection in jurisdictions with 
local Zika transmission increased 21%, from 2.0 per 1,000 live 
births (CI = 1.7–2.4) to 2.4 (CI = 2.1–2.8) (Figure 2). This 
increase indicated there were 29 more infants and fetuses with 
birth defects than were expected in areas with local transmis-
sion in the second half of 2016 (169 observed cases compared 
with 140 expected, p = 0.009). The prevalence of birth defects 
excluding NTDs in “higher” prevalence jurisdictions did not 
change (2.4 per 1,000 live births) and the prevalence in the 
“lower” prevalence jurisdictions significantly decreased from 
2.8 per 1,000 live births (CI = 2.5–3.0) to 2.4 (CI = 2.2-2.7). 
Among 393 infants and fetuses with birth defects potentially

related to Zika virus infection in areas with local transmis-
sion, 32 (8.1%) had laboratory evidence of possible Zika virus 
infection in a maternal, placental, infant, or fetal sample, 59 
(15.0%) had negative Zika virus test results, and 302 (76.81%) 
had no testing performed or no results available.
Discussion
Leveraging existing birth defects surveillance systems per-
mitted rapid implementation of surveillance for birth defects 
potentially related to Zika virus infection early during the U.S. 
Zika virus outbreak. The prevalence of birth defects strongly 
linked to Zika virus infection increased significantly in areas 
with local Zika virus transmission (29 more than were expected 
in the second half of 2016 compared with observed prevalence 
in the first half). This finding underscores the importance of 
surveillance for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus 
infection and the need for continued monitoring in areas at 
risk for Zika transmission and exposure. 
An increase in birth defects potentially related to Zika was 
only observed in jurisdictions with local Zika virus transmis-
sion, and this difference was significant when NTDs were 
excluded. Brain and eye abnormalities and consequences of 
CNS dysfunction have been most consistently described in 
cases of congenital Zika infection, whereas the evidence sup-
porting a possible association between NTDs and Zika virus 
infection during pregnancy is weak (1,2). In jurisdictions 
with “lower” (low or no travel-associated) Zika prevalence, 
the reason for the significant decrease in prevalence of birth 
defects potentially related to Zika (both including NTDs and 
excluding NTDs) is not clear. However, birth defects surveil-
lance data typically are not final until approximately 24 months 
after the end of the birth year, and this release of data only 
12 months after the end of the birth year likely resulted in less 
complete ascertainment of birth defects in late 2016 compared 
with early 2016. Further case ascertainment from the final 
quarter of 2016 is anticipated in all jurisdictions. In addition, 
the peak occurrence of birth defects potentially related to Zika 
virus infection is expected to have occurred in the 2017 birth 
cohort because the peak of Zika virus transmission occurred 
in Puerto Rico in August 2016, and local transmission of Zika 
virus was identified in southern Florida in June 2016 and in 
southern Texas in November 2016 (4–7).
The overall prevalence of the birth defects in this analysis 
(3.0 per 1,000 live births) was similar to a previously published 
baseline prevalence of birth defects potentially related to Zika 
virus infection from 2013–14 (2.9 per 1,000 live births;

95% CI = 2.7–3.1) (8). The findings presented here included 
data from an additional 12 jurisdictions, which covers a larger 
birth cohort totaling nearly 1 million live births, representing 
approximately one fourth of the total live births in the U.S. 
states and territories.
The findings in this report are subject to at least three 
limitations. First, the three jurisdictions with local Zika virus 
transmission differed from one another in the scope and timing 
of identified local transmission of Zika virus. Whereas Puerto 
Rico experienced a widespread outbreak that began in early 
2016, local transmission in Texas was not confirmed until 
November 2016. In addition, jurisdictions with local transmis-
sion also had a high prevalence of travel-related Zika virus dis-
ease in 2016 (3), which could have contributed to the observed 
increased prevalence in birth defects. Second, increased aware-
ness of birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection 
in areas with local transmission might have resulted in increased 
efforts focused on rapid and complete identification of these 
birth defects cases during the second half of 2016. However, 
a significant increase in NTD prevalence was not observed. 
Although more complete ascertainment might partially explain 
the increased prevalence observed in areas with local transmis-
sion, it is unlikely that it would lead to a significant change, 
given the longstanding, mature surveillance systems, the 
standardized case review process, and no observable change in 
the prevalence of NTDs. Finally, jurisdictions in this analysis 
might differ in population demographics and systematic case-
finding methodology, contributing to differences in observed 
prevalences among the three groups (9). A comparison of the 
prevalences in the first and second halves of the year was used 
to partially control for regional differences and monitor trends 
for those specific jurisdictional groups rather than to compare 
one group with another.
Collaboration between state and territorial Zika pregnancy 
and infant registries and birth defects surveillance systems 
provides a model for using the complementary approach of 
a prospective, exposure-based surveillance and conventional 
disease-based surveillance to respond to an emerging public 
health threat. The U.S. Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry¶¶ 
can provide an early alert mechanism regarding clinical charac-
teristics and manifestations of infants and fetuses with potential 
congenital infection; over 7,000 pregnancies with laboratory 
evidence of Zika virus infection have been reported, and CDC 
 
¶¶ The U.S. Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry includes the U.S. Zika Pregnancy 
Registry  and the Zika Active Pregnancy Surveillance System, which together 
collect information about pregnancy and infant outcomes among women 
with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection during pregnancy in the 50 
states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories, until at least 2 years of 
age. (https://www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/research/registry.html).

is monitoring pregnancy and infant adverse outcomes (https://
www.cdc.gov/pregnancy/zika/data/pregnancy-outcomes.html). 
Established birth defects surveillance systems can adapt to 
monitor other emerging pregnancy, infant, and newborn 
outcomes of concern beyond structural birth defects, includ-
ing functional problems such as hearing loss, and can provide 
additional clinical information through standardized data col-
lection and clinical review. Finally, birth defects surveillance 
systems can provide an important mechanism for facilitating 
timely access to services among infants with birth defects 
and serve as a resource for assessing subsequent health and 
developmental outcomes among these children. The unique 
contributions of ongoing birth defects surveillance and the 
U.S. Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry are both critical to 
optimally monitoring pregnant women and infants from the 
threat of Zika virus infection and implementing appropriate 
prevention efforts (10).
