BACKGROUND: The Veterans Affairs (VA) health care sys-
tem aims to provide high-quality medical care to veterans
in the USA, but the quality of VA care has recently drawn
the concern of Congress. The objective of this study was to
systematically review published evidence examining the
quality of care provided at VA health care facilities com-
pared to quality of care in other facilities and systems.
METHODS: Building on the search strategy and results of
a prior systematic review, we searched MEDLINE (from
January 1, 2005, to January 1, 2015) to identify relevant
articles on the quality of care at VA facilities compared to
non-VA facilities. Articles from the prior systematic review
published from 2005 and onward were also included and
re-abstracted. Studies were classified, analyzed, and
summarized by the Institute of Medicine’s quality
dimensions.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine articles were identified (including
31 articles from the prior systematic review and 38 new
articles) that address one or more Institute of Medicine
quality dimensions: safety (34 articles), effectiveness (24
articles), efficiency (9 articles), patient-centeredness (5
articles), equity (4 articles), and timeliness (1 article).
Studies of safety and effectiveness indicated generally
better or equal performance, with some exceptions. Too
few articles related to timeliness, equity, efficiency, and
patient-centeredness were found from which to reliably
draw conclusions about VA care related to these
dimensions.
DISCUSSION: The VA often (but not always) performs
better than or similarly to other systems of care with
regard to the safety and effectiveness of care. Addi-
tional studies of quality of care in the VA are needed
on all aspects of quality, but particularly with regard
to timeliness, equity, efficiency, and patient-
centeredness.

INTRODUCTION
Providing high-quality health care is central to our na-
tion’s commitment to veterans. The Veterans Affairs
health care system (VA), the nation’s largest integrated
health care system, provides comprehensive health ser-
vices to US military veterans who are enrolled. Howev-
er, the quality of VA care is a longstanding area of
concern.1,
2 As a result, the Veterans Access, Choice
and Accountability Act (VACAA), passed in 2014, man-
dated an independent assessment of health care capabil-
ities and resources of the Veterans Health Administra-
tion.3 As part of this assessment, the Interim Under
Secretary for Health for VA called for a comprehensive
evaluation of BVA’s ability to deliver high-quality health
care to Veterans.^4
Previous studies have systematically reviewed aspects of
care at the VA.5–7 Two peer-reviewed articles based on one of
these7 summarized the available evidence on medical8 and
surgical9 care quality through 2009. This review indicated that
in most studies, the care provided in the VA compares favor-
ably to non-VA systems. However, quality may have changed
in the last 6 years since this review, and concerns about quality
of care have continued to mount.10 To assess the quality of
care provided by the VA, we performed a systematic review of
published comparisons of the quality of care in VA facilities to
other settings.
METHODS
Search Strategy
We defined quality of care using the Institute of Medicine’s
(IOM) definition, which is Bthe degree to which health ser-
vices for individuals and populations increase the likelihood of
desired health outcomes and are consistent with current pro-
fessional knowledge.^11 Given the existence of a recent sys-
tematic review on the quality of health care delivered in VA
versus comparable non-VA settings, we chose to explicitly
build upon and expand this work.7 We use consistent methods,
including the same search terms (Online Appendix) and data-
base (MEDLINE). The dates searched were limited to the past
10 years (January 1, 2005, to January 1, 2015) to ensure a
reasonable scope and up-to-date studies.

 Article Screening and Data Abstraction
Titles and abstracts identified by our literature search were
screened by two reviewers with experience screening and
abstracting data for health-related systematic reviews (CO,
CH) under the supervision of a senior member of the study
team with extensive clinical and systematic review experience
(CG) for inclusion in full-text screening. If the article present-
ed comparisons of quality of health care in the VA and non-VA
settings in the US, the full text of each article was reviewed
independently by both reviewers (CO, CH). We extracted the
data sources, geographical areas, clinical conditions, quality
dimensions, and comparability of measures in each sample.
Studies were excluded if they included no original data; were
case reports; or used non-contemporaneous comparisons, un-
equal or non-representative samples, or dissimilar or indirect
quality measures. Data from each article, including the size of
the VA and non-VA samples, years of data collection, control
variables, and primary and secondary outcomes, were ab-
stracted by one reviewer and double-checked by another re-
viewer (CO, CH). Disagreements were resolved by a senior
team member (CG).
Quality Assessment
Article quality was assessed using the criteria developed in
the original review for assessing comparative health care
quality studies.7 Briefly, six elements were used, including
whether: (1) time periods during which the VA and non-
VA patients were studied were sufficiently contemporane-
ous; (2) VA and non-VA samples were comparable in
size/scope; (3) quality measurements were assessed using
specified and identical indicators with a similar assessment
format; (4) quality measures were meaningfully associated
with outcomes; (5) measures were clinically relevant and
important; and (6) the statistical methodology was sound.
Each factor was graded (A for excellent, B for acceptable,
C for unacceptable). The overall subjective assessment of
the article was created, but this assessment was not an
Baverage^ of individual component grades. Thus, an article
with a critical flaw could be graded BC^ and rejected, even
if it scored well on other criteria. Articles were graded by
one reviewer and double-checked by the other reviewer
(CO, CH). Disagreements were resolved in consultation
with the senior team member (CG).
Study Classification
Although we employed a nearly identical search and
abstraction strategy, we organized article categories dif-
ferently than the original review,7 which split articles
into medical8 (non-surgical) and surgical9 care and by
Donabedian’s quality triad of structure, process, and
outcome.12 To guide decision making about how to
improve quality at the VA, we organized our review
using the IOM’s six characteristics of high-quality care:
safe, timely, equitable, effective, efficient, and patient-
centered,11 and then grouped similar kinds of outcomes
together. Timeliness as related to delays or wait times
for receiving necessary medical care (e.g., time from
admission to emergency surgery) was included in this
review. Timeliness as it relates solely to access (e.g.,
wait time for obtaining an appointment)—while a criti-
cal issue currently facing the VA13—was not addressed
because no studies directly comparing VA and non-VA
settings were identified.14 We included articles on effi-
ciency if they assessed appropriateness (necessary care
versus overuse). We excluded cost-efficiency articles, as
cost comparisons between VA and other settings have a
number of limitations.15
We classified each study (both new and from the
prior review) according to the direction of the statisti-
cally significant differences in performance measures for
the VA care relative to a non-VA comparison group. If
VA quality of care was shown to be better than non-VA
care or if multiple results were reported and VA quality
of care was better in some instances and the same in
others, the study was classified as BVA better.^ If mul-
tiple quality measures were reported and VA care was
better than non-VA on some and worse on others, the
study was classified as Bmixed.^ If the quality of care in
VA and non-VA did not differ, the study was classified
as Bsame.^ If VA quality of care was shown to be worse
than non-VA, the study was classified as BVA worse,^ as
were studies with multiple results reported where the
quality of care was worse in some instances and the
same in others.
Ensuring Comparability of Populations
Wherever possible, we report results adjusted for risk, comor-
bidities, demographics, or other variables. Unadjusted results
are noted. We included and emphasized studies that compare
VA patients to veterans receiving care in non-VA settings. We
also included studies that compared veterans receiving VA
care (referred to as BVA patients^) with individuals who are
not identified as veterans receiving non-VA care (referred to as
Bnon-veterans^).
RESULTS
Searches yielded 461 articles, 306 of which were rejected at
abstract screening; 155 proceeded to full-text screening. Data
were extracted from 69 articles; 31 of these were also included
in the previous review,7 yielding 38 new articles (Fig. 1).
Included articles were categorized by quality dimension: safe-
ty (34), timeliness (1), equity (4), effectiveness (24), efficiency
(9), and patient-centeredness (5). Studies were sufficiently
heterogeneous to preclude pooling or other meta-analysis, so
results are presented narratively. The 34 articles on safety and
24 on effectiveness are summarized in Table 1.

 Safety
Safety measures focused on avoiding illness/injury to
patients resulting from medical care, such as complica-
tions following surgical procedures. Studies of morbidity
and mortality were also included in this category, as
were studies about adherence to safety guidelines or
best practices. In 22 of 34 articles on safety, VA gener-
ally performed as well (11 studies) or better (11 studies)
than non-VA settings. VA fared worse in nine studies
and had mixed performance in three studies.
Mortality. VA facilities generally performed comparably or
favorably relative to other settings in terms of mortality.
Mortality rates associated with specific conditions16–19 or
following surgery20–26 were often similar for VA patients
compared with non-veterans, and occasionally lower.17 How-
ever, some studies found higher surgical mortality among V
A
patients compared with non-veterans.19, 22, 26–29 Lower mor-
tality rates were observed after cataract surgeries for VA
patients compared with veterans who are Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries.30 Mortality among veterans residing in
V
A nursing homes and community nursing homes was simi-
lar.31 Veterans undergoing dialysis treatment in V
A and non-
V
A settings experienced similar mortality.32 Adjusted mortal-
ity was lower among male V
A patients compared with male
Medicare Advantage beneficiaries over 65 years old;33–36
results were similar for females.34 Mortality within 1 year of
admission after hip fracture was 21 % lower among veterans
admitted to non-VA hospitals compared with VA patients.37
Mortality rates have declined more quickly in VA over time
than in non-V
A settings.38
Morbidity. VA facilities had mixed results with respect to
most studies of morbidity. Postoperative morbidity was
lower for VA patients compared with non-veterans in
some surgeries,22, 25, 39 while for other surgeries it was
similar.40–44 In a study comparing quality of care in
nursing homes, veterans in VA nursing homes were less
likely to develop a pressure ulcer than veterans in com-
munity nursing homes.31 However, other studies found
that morbidity among VA patients is worse after pancre-
atectomy28 and for male patients only after gastric by-
pass, compared to patients in private sector hospitals
(unadjusted).41
Complications. VA facilities had mixed results with respect to
complications after surgery. Surgical complication rates were
similar among VA patients and non-veterans.21, 23, 29 Higher
complication rates were observed for VA patients undergoing
cataract surgeries than veterans who were Medicare fee-for-
service beneficiaries.45 Among all kidney transplant recipi-
ents, VA patients had higher graft failure risk than non-
veterans.27
Other Safety Measures. VA hospitals were more likely to
follow best practices for central venous catheter bloodstream
infection prevention compared with non-VA hospitals.46 How-
ever, performance on the Agency for Healthcare Research and
Fig. 1 Flow Diagram of Included and Excluded Studies. Of the 461 articles identified using our search strategies, 306 were excluded at title/
abstract screening and 155 were screened for inclusion using the full text of the article. Of these, 86 were excluded, leaving 38 new articles for
data abstraction. These articles were combined with the 31 articles from the prior review that met inclusion criteria, resulting in the 69 articles
included in this systematic review.

*We assessed each study in the review according to the statistically significant differences in performance on quality of care measures for VA care relative to a non-VA comparison group. If the VA quality of
care was shown to be better than quality for non-VA care, the study was classified as BVA better.^ If VA quality of care was better in some instances and the same in other instances compared to non-VA care in
the same study, the study was also classified as BVA better.^ If multiple quality measures were reported in the study and VA care was better than non-VA on some and worse on others, the study was classified
as Bmixed.^ If the quality of care in the VA and non-VA did not differ, the study was classified as Bsame.^ If the VA quality of care was shown to be worse than non-VA, the study was classified as BVA worse^
(as were studies where the quality of care was worse in some instances and the same in other instances)

‡Each article was given an overall assessment of quality shown in the Final Grade column. This assessment was based on the following criteria: time frames, samples (both VA and non-VA), quality
measurements, outcomes, importance of measures, and statistical methods. Each of these factors was assigned a grade (A, B, or C) based on the data abstraction grading guidelines developed in the original
systematic review. The overall assessment was predicated on the global assessment of the article considering the individual components, but was not an average. Thus, an article that had, for example, a
critical flaw in methodology would be a BC,^ even if other issues were satisfactory. Articles that received an overall grade of BC^ were rejected from the review

 Quality’s (AHRQ) patient safety indicators was found to be a

pared with non-VA hospitals.47–49
Effectiveness
Seventeen studies showed better performance in VA facilities,
while three had similar performance, one was mixed, and three
were worse than non-VA settings.
Outpatient Care. Outpatient care was generally strong in V
A
facilities. VA patients received higher quality care than non-
veterans for one measure of preventive care mammography
(85–90 % vs. 64–77 %) and two measures of outpatient diabetic
management (annual HbA1c test: 94–96 % vs. 70–81 %; annual
eye examination: 67–85 % vs. 68–74 %) (no statistical tests).50
V
A patients also received more effective care than non-veterans
based on 10 of 11 quality measures in the first study year and all
12 quality measures in the second study year assessing diabetes,
cardiovascular, and cancer screening care, with rate differences
ranging from 4.3 percentage points (95 % confidence interval
[CI] 3.2–5.4) for cholesterol testing in coronary heart disease to
30.8 (95 % CI 28.1–33.5) for colorectal cancer screening.51
Receipt of diabetes education and annual HbA1c tests was higher
among V
A patients compared with veterans in non-V
A care.52
V
A patients were more likely than veterans receiving care outside
V
A to receive recommended diabetes care, including being twice
as likely to have a foot examination and 60–70 % more likely to
have an eye examination, two or more A1c tests, and two or more
providers visits,53 a routine checkup within 2 years (91.6 %
among V
A patients compared to 80.6 % overall; P < 0.001),54
and influenza and pneumonia vaccinations (rates increased 10–
240 %),53, 55, 56 but similar rates of cholesterol screening.55 Blood
pressure control was higher among male African-American V
A
patients than male African-American non-V
A patients (49.4 %
vs. 44.0 %, P < 0.01) though similar among Caucasians.57 V
A
patients were more likely than non-V
A patients to receive rec-
ommended ambulatory preventive and disease management ser-
vices,58 including influenza and pneumococcal vaccination.58, 59
These studies used a national sample comparison group of non-
V
A patients, which may have included both veterans and non-
veterans. Obese V
A patients were more than twice as likely to
have received advice to lose weight as veterans receiving non-V
A
care and non-veterans and equally likely to have received advice
to maintain weight.60 However, in a study of veterans receiving
primary care at V
A-staffed versus contract community clinics,
veterans with diabetes at V
A-staffed clinics were less likely to
receive a retinal examination (odds ratio [OR] 0.72, 95 % CI
0.55–0.93) and veterans with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease at V
A-staffed clinics were less likely to receive a flu shot
(OR 0.73, 95 % CI 0.55–0.99).61
Non-Ambulatory Care. In non-ambulatory settings, V
A care
was generally of similar quality to care provided in non-V
A
facilities. Compared with non-V
A patients from the Medicare
cancer patient database, V
A patients had earlier diagnosis of
colon and rectal cancers, higher rates for three quality measures,
similar rates for nine, and lower rates for one.62 Comparison of an
academic practice and a V
A hospital found that appropriate use of
stress/rest myocardial perfusion imaging studies did not differ
between settings.63 Rates of hemodialysis via arteriovenous fis-
tulas (which are preferred by guidelines over other methods) were
not different between V
A patients and Medicare patients after
accounting for pre-end-stage renal disease care.64 V
A patients
received higher quality care than non-veterans for nine out of ten
measures of inpatient care and performed similarly on one
measure.50
Medication Management. Medication management was
examined in a number of settings, including outpatient,
emergency department, and inpatient. Elderly V
A patients were
less likely to receive inappropriate medication than were patients
in Medicare HMOs,65 and V
A patients with acute myocardial
infarction were more likely to receive appropriate medications
than were non-V
A patients.66 Observed compliance by providers
with erythropoietin administration guidelines was higher at V
A
than in the private sector.67 Antibiotic prescribing practices were
generally similar between seven V
A and seven non-V
A emer-
gency departments; however, in the three cities in which pre-
scription rates were not comparable between V
A and non-V
A
sites, V
A sites had much higher rates of antibiotic prescriptions.68
Availability of Services. The structure of women’s health care
differed at eight V
A women’s health centers and 13 Department
of Health and Human Services Centers of Excellence. Preventive
cancer screening and general reproductive services were
available at all centers, while V
A centers were less likely to
offer extensive reproductive services but more likely to offer
mental health care.69 Eight of 15 clinical pharmacy services
were more commonly provided in V
A hospitals than non-V
A
hospitals [in-service education was 25 % higher (P = 0.003),
clinical research 154 % higher (P < 0.0001), drug protocol man-
agement 28 % higher (P < 0.0001), drug therapy counseling
80 % higher (P < 0.0001), participation on rounds 38 % higher
(P = 0.001), and admission drug histories 310 % higher
(P < 0.0001)].70 V
A patients and Medicare/Medicaid-insured pa-
tients were less likely to receive kidney transplants than were
patients with private insurance.71
End-of-Life Care. V
A tended to avoid inappropriate care and
utilize palliative care at end of life. Increasing use of
chemotherapy at the end of life is associated with higher rates
of in-hospital deaths and later admission to hospice, which are
linked to lower quality end-of-life care.72–75 When comparing
male V
A patients and Medicare patients with lung and colorectal
cancer, V
A patients were less likely to receive chemotherapy
within 14 days of death or to be admitted to an ICU within
30 days of death, and they were similarly likely to have more
than one emergency room visit within 30 days of death.76
Among veterans who died in VA facilities, palliative care con-
sults (67 % vs. 21 %, P < 0.001) and death in a dedicated

 palliative care, hospice unit, or intensive care unit were more
common (47 % vs. 16 %, P < 0.001), and death in a nursing
home was less common (10 % vs. 26 %, P < 0.001) than among
veterans who died in non-V
A facilities (all unadjusted results).77
Timeliness, Equity, Efficiency,
and Patient-Centeredness
Since fewer than ten studies were found that related to each of the
dimensions of timeliness, equity, efficiency, and patient-
centeredness, we do not discuss the results of these studies in
detail (results and evidence tables in Online Appendix). The
single study that addressed timeliness of care showed worse
performance among veterans in V
A facilities relative to non-V
A
facilities for time between hospital admission for hip fracture and
surgical repair.37 Four studies examined equity, with one study
showing better performance on several chronic disease and pre-
ventive measures,51 one study showing worse performance in
V
A facilities for emergency room visits among cancer patients in
the last month of life,76 and two studies showing similar equity in
30-day post-admission mortality78 and graft failure.27 Nine arti-
cles compared efficiency using utilization, with six studies show-
ing worse performance in VA facilities on outcomes such as
average length of stay and service utilization for patients on
dialysis,32, 61, 79–82 two showing better performance for visits/
admissions83 and generic drug utilization,84 and one with mixed
results for utilization-related inpatient quality indicators. Five
studies examined patient-centeredness; three studies demonstrat-
ed better patient and family satisfaction in V
A facilities77, 85, 86
and two demonstrated similar performance in perceptions of
racial discrimination and satisfaction in transitional programs
for homeless veterans.87, 88
DISCUSSION
In this systematic review, we identified 69 studies comparing
quality of care provided in V
A facilities to non-V
A care. Studies
of safety and effectiveness indicated generally favorable perfor-
mance by V
A facilities compared to non-V
A facilities, with 22 of
34 studies of safety and 20 of 24 studies of effectiveness showing
the same or better quality of care in V
A facilities and the remain-
der showing mixed (four studies) or worse (12 studies) perfor-
mance. In terms of safety, V
A facilities performed similarly or
better in most, but not all, studies comparing morbidity and
mortality. Results from studies about complications and patient
safety indicators were more mixed. In terms of effectiveness, V
A
facilities had similar or superior quality to non-V
A facilities with
respect to preventive, recommended, and end-of-life care, as well
as managing medications. Non-ambulatory care studies indicated
similar care quality between V
A and non-V
A settings. However,
studies on service availability had mixed results. A comparison of
studies included in the previous review, which included studies
from 1990 to 2009, and those identified in this review (2005 to
2014) showed that while numerous studies have been published
in the last 5 years, no stark trends can be observed in terms of
whether older or newer studies demonstrate systematically better
or worse performance in VA settings (Table 2).
In keeping with the findings of the prior review, we find that
V
A is generally more adherent to recommended care processes
than other systems of care. However, better processes did not
necessarily achieve better outcomes, as we observed few differ-
ences in adjusted mortality. Although easy to obtain, mortality
may not be the optimal outcome for comparison for several
reasons, some of which were noted in the prior review.7–9 While
nearly every study we included attempted to risk-adjust the
veteran and non-veteran populations, some excess baseline mor-
tality risk may still be present, since veterans have comparatively
worse health status than the general population.89–91 Mortality
rates are also known not to be sensitive in detecting differences in
the quality of health care provided.92–94 Other outcomes, such as
complications specific to a disease or procedure of interest, might
be more revealing about meaningful quality differences in V
A
settings than those included in this review.
Our review builds on a previous review conducted in this
area,7–9 but both updates and expands upon it. Updating the
results of the prior review up to 2015 is critically important given
the ongoing interest in the quality of care provided at the V
A.95 In
addition to categorizing the studies published since the prior
review, we also categorized the studies contained in the prior
review to provide a broad picture of quality at the V
A over the last
decade along the dimensions of health care quality proposed by
the IOM.11. This categorization allows us to highlight the gaps in
research by dimension, which may help inform the investment of
resources for research and improvement by V
A stakeholders.
This study is subject to a number of limitations. The search
strategy employed was narrowly defined to align with the
methods of the previous review, but this may have excluded
relevant studies. Most studies were not conducted with perfectly
matched comparison groups (i.e., veterans receiving care in V
A
and non-veterans in non-VA settings). While we used risk-
adjusted or otherwise comparable results wherever possible, this
may not have accounted for unobservable differences between
veterans and non-veterans. Although we included confidence
intervals or levels of significance in the evidence tables (Table 1
and Online Appendix), it was not always possible to determine
whether lack of a significant difference was due to an underpow-
ered study versus evidence of a lack of a difference. However,
while many of the studies used large, nationally representative

 samples, some of the smaller studies did observe significant
differences. We also did not assess whether the magnitudes of
differences were clinically significant, as the thresholds for
clinical differences for many of the outcomes investigated may
be subjective. In deciding which studies to include, we
assessed the study design of each (Table 1) and excluded
low-quality studies from this review. However, we did not
systematically assess each study’s risk of bias beyond that. It is
notable that all but 4 of the 69 articles included had at least one
VA-affiliated author or were funded directly by VA.
Nonetheless, the available data indicate overall comparable
health care quality in VA facilities compared to non-VA facili-
ties with regard to safety and effectiveness. Rates of complica-
tions and availability of services had the least favorable results,
but these results were mixed rather than consistently poor. The
overall number of studies comparing VA and non-VA care was
small, and study quality varied. More studies that examine and
compare the quality of VA care with respect to timeliness,
equity, efficiency, and patient-centeredness are needed to better
assess VA facilities’ performance on these quality dimensions.
