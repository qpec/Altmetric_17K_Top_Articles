Hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (HF-WBI) has been proved effective and safe and even better for late or acute radiation 
toxicity for early breast cancer. Moreover, it improves patient convenience, quality of life and is expected to be advantageous 
in the medical care system by reducing overall cost. In this review, we examined key randomized trials of HF-WBI, focusing on 
adequate patient selection as suggested by the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) guideline and 
the radiobiologic aspects of HF-WBI in relation to its adoption into clinical settings. Further investigation to identify the current 
practice pattern or cost effectiveness is warranted under the national health insurance service system in Korea.

Introduction
Whole breast irradiation after breast conserving surgery (BCS) 
has been established as the standard treatment for breast 
cancer. The radiation schedule of 50 Gy/25 fractions in 5 weeks 
used in earlier trials demonstrated the efficacy of BCS and 
adjuvant whole breast radiotherapy to be equivalent to that of 
mastectomy [1,2]. The support of standard fractionated whole 
breast irradiation (SF-WBI) for breast cancer is based on the 
radiobiologic consideration that radiation damage to normal 
tissue is greater with larger fraction size without additional 
tumor control [3]. As a result, SF-WBI in the adjuvant 
treatment after lumpectomy has been the standard for several 
decades. However, some of the challenges of SF-WBI are cost 
and inconvenience of the patient involved with daily treatment 
courses from 5 to 7 weeks. This has led to the suggestion 
of short fractionation as a new standard following BCS for 
early stage breast cancer. Hypofractionated whole breast 
irradiation (HF-WBI), based on precedent studies over the 
past two decades, offers an opportunity for improved patient 
convenience, lower healthcare costs, and greater access to care 
without sacrificing treatment outcomes.
In this review, we examined key randomized trials of HF-
WBI, focusing on adequate patient selection as suggested by 
the American Society of Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology 
(ASTRO) guideline and the radiobiologic aspects of HF-WBI in 
relation to its adoption into clinical settings.
Key Randomized Trials
Up until now, 4 randomized trials—the Royal Marsden 
Hospital/Gloucestershire Oncology Center (RMH/GOC) trial

[4,5], the UK Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy (START) 
trial A and B [6-8], and the Canadian trial [9]—have supported 
the establishment of HF-WBI with recent publication of 10-
year outcomes. Details on the study design, patient inclusion 
criteria, dose fractionation schedule, and treatment outcomes 
are described in Table 1. All studies included stage T1-3 
and N0-1 early breast cancer. The majority of patients were 
older than 50 and some proportion of the patients received 
chemotherapy. Though allowed in other trials, the Canadian 
trial did not include regional nodal irradiation and tumor bed 
boost. 
The radiobiologic rationale for HF-WBI is based on the 
notion that if α/β of the tumor is similar to the α/β of 
irradiated normal tissue, larger fraction sizes will be more 
effective without giving a detrimental effect to normal breast 
tissue. In such context, the RMH/GOC trial was a pilot study 
to identify the α/β of breast tissues, using late normal tissue 
effects as the primary endpoint. The RMH/GOC trial compared 2 
different HF-WBI schedules, 39 Gy and 42.9 Gy in 13 fractions 
over 5 weeks, with the standard 50 Gy/25 fraction schedule. 
Comparing 3 different regimens allowed the estimation of α/
β for several radiation-related endpoints by assuming linearity 
between the 2 test dose levels. The 13-fraction schedule that 
is isoeffective with 50 Gy in 25 fractions can be determined 
by interpolation [4]. After a minimum follow-up 9.7 years, any 
change in breast appearance was seen in 39.6%, 30.3%, and 
45.7%, and ipsilateral breast tumor relapse (IBTR) occurred in 
12.1%, 14.8%, and 9.6% for the 50 Gy/25 fraction, 39 Gy/13 
fraction, and 42.9 Gy/13 fraction regimen, respectively [4]. 
Based on these results, α/β for breast cancer was estimated 
to be 4.0 Gy, which is similar to that of late-reacting healthy 
tissue [5]. Because 42.9 Gy/13 fractions seemed to have slightly 
more late normal tissue effects than standard fractionation [6], 
START A trial compared 39 Gy and 41.6 Gy with 13 fractions 
over 5 weeks with standard fractions. It should be noted that 
the patients treated with the HF-WBI schedule in the RMH/
GOC and START A trials were treated with total treatment time 
maintained to 5 weeks, which means these patients were not 
treated daily. 
At 10-year follow-up, START A trial showed no significant 
difference between the HF-WBI arms (39 Gy and 41.6 Gy) 
and the SF-WBI control arm. Disease free survival and overall 
survival were not significantly different between any of the 
START A treatment schedules [8]. Moreover, moderate or 
marked breast induration, telangiectasia, and breast edema 
were significantly less common normal tissue effects in the 39 
Gy group than in the 50 Gy group [8].
START trial B aimed to provide a robust evidence base 
for clinical practice in breast radiotherapy by comparing a 
commonly used 40 Gy/15 fractions HF-WBI schedule within 
3 weeks with SF-WBI. There was no difference between 
the 2 treatment arms for the primary end point of loco-
regional failure. For the late normal tissue, breast shrinkage, 
telangiectasia, and breast edema were significantly less 
common in the HF-WBI than in the SF-WBI group [8].
Lastly, in the Canadian trial, HF-WBI 42.5 Gy/16 fractions 
daily treatment was compared with SF-WBI. There was no 
difference in cumulative local recurrence between the 2 dose 
schedules at 10 years [9]. Local recurrence was 6.7% in SF-WBI 
arm and 6.2% in HF-WBI arm. Regarding cosmetic outcome, 
71.3% of patients in SF-WBI arm and 69.8% of the patients 
in HF-WBI arm had a good or excellent cosmetic outcome 
without statistically significant difference. 
ASTRO Guideline
Based on these studies, ASTRO published an evidence-based 
guideline for HF-WBI in 2011 [10]. The guideline states that the 
panel reached a consensus on supporting HF-WBI for patients 
who meet all of the following criteria: age older than 50 years, 
stage T1-2N0 disease, no use of chemotherapy, and central 
axis dose of 93% to 107%. Recommended dose-fractionation 
schemes are 42.5 Gy in 16 fractions as in the Canadian trial, 
41.6 Gy in 13 fractions over 5 weeks as in START A, and 40 
Gy in 15 fractions over 3 weeks as in START B. The HF-WBI 
doses used in the RMH/GOC trial, compared with the 50-Gy 
arm, were not recommended because the 42.9-Gy arm yielded 
excessive toxicity and the 39-Gy arm yielded a higher risk of 
IBTR.
This criteria is based upon the inclusion criteria 
and outcomes of the key studies stated above. These 
recommendations are relatively conservative. The guideline 
states that “for other patients, the task force could not reach 
agreement either for or against the use of HF-WBI, which 
nevertheless should not be interpreted as a contraindication to 
its use [11].”
Indication beyond the Guideline
1. Age
Younger age is a risk factor for local failure of breast cancer 
[12]. However, only 21%–30% of the patients in the key 
randomized trials of HF-WBI were younger than 50 years. 
Subgroup analysis in the Canadian trial showed that the

influence of fraction schedule on IBTR was not different 
regardless of age. Moreover, in 10-year follow-up results of the 
START trials published after the ASTRO guideline, younger age 
patients favors HF-WBI in terms of local-regional relapse [8]. 
This justifies the implication of hypofractionation for patients 
younger than 50 years. 
2. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) 
DCIS patients were not included in major studies. However, 
there is an ongoing randomized trial to test the efficacy and 
safety of HF-WBI for patients with DCIS [13]. Moreover, there 
are numerous retrospective data and meta-analysis that found 
no difference in local recurrence between the HF-WBI and 
SF-WBI [14,15]. HF-WBI for DCIS is unlikely to lead to worse 
tumor control or worse side effect compared with SF-WBI [11]. 
Therefore, HF-WBI could be offered as an option to patients.
3. Grade 
In the Canadian study, subgroup analysis showed that 
hypofractionation appeared to be less effective for high-
grade tumors than for lower-grade tumors [9]. In contrast, 
recent 10-year follow-up results of START A and B did not 
demonstrate treatment effect to be significantly different 
respective to grade [8]. This discrepancy could be explained by 
the fact that tumor bed boost was not allowed in the Canadian 
study, whereas 61% and 39% of the patients received tumor 
bed boost with 10 Gy in 5 fractions in START A and B trials, 
respectively. Another explanation comes from the fact that 
the grading system originally conducted in the Canadian trial 
was the Scharff Bloom Richardson (SBR) grading system. This 
system was replaced by the more quantitative and reproducible 
Nottingham grading system. After a central pathology review 
and assessment of tumor grade using the Nottingham grading 
system, the tumor grade did not show relation to the type of 
radiotherapy (RT) received in terms of local recurrence [16]. 
Moreover, there is a population-based cohort study showing 
no inferior outcome of hypofractionation in patients with 
grade 3 breast cancer [17]. 
4. Regional node irradiation (RNI)
Only 21%, 14%, 7%, and 0% of the patients received regional 
nodal irradiation in RMH/GOC, START A, START B, and Canadian 
trials, respectively. Although only 1 of 750 patients in the 41.6 
Gy/13 fraction arm in the START A trial developed brachial 
plexopathy [6], and there were no significant difference of 
shoulder stiffness or arm edema between HF-WBI and SF-WBI 
arms in START A and B trials [8], the follow-up after HF-WBI 
in both START trials was not considered sufficient to exclude 
such late toxicity. However, there were several retrospective 
data reassuring the use of hypofractionation in RNI. Based on 
the literature review by Galecki et al. [18], the risk of radiation-
induced brachial plexopathy was less than 1% when using 
regimens with dose per fraction between 2.2 Gy and 2.5 Gy 
with total dose between 34 Gy and 40 Gy. Contemporarily, 
published data support the feasibility of hypofractionated RNI 
and the need for a prospective randomized trial addressing 
clinical outcomes and toxicity of hypofractionated RNI 
compared with those of standard fractionation RNI [19].
5. Chemotherapy
In the key randomized trials, 11% to 35% of the patients 
used chemotherapy. Anthracycline and taxane containing 
chemotherapy regimens were used in 25% and 1%, 
respectively, for patients in the START A trial and in 13% and 
0.4%, respectively, for patients in the START B trial [6,7]. Major 
concern regarding anthracycline chemotherapy is cardiac 
toxicity. Hazard ratios for normal tissue toxicity were not 
significantly different regardless of use of chemotherapy in 
the subgroup analyses of Canadian and START trials [8,9]. 
Although current follow-up data is relatively short considering 
late cardiac toxicity, radiobiologic consideration of HF-WBI, 
which will be described in detail later, and modern radiation 
delivery techniques such as intensity modulated radiotherapy 
(IMRT) may save substantial dose to the heart. 
6. Boost
Regarding tumor bed boost, 75% received 14 Gy/7 fractions in 
RMH/GOC trials and 61% and 39% received 10 Gy/5 fractions 
in the START A and B trials, respectively, whereas no patients 
were given boost irradiation in the Canadian trials. ASTRO 
guideline stated that “the task force agreed that the use of 
HF-WBI alone (without a boost) is not appropriate when a 
tumor bed boost is thought to be indicated. The optimal HF-
WBI regimen to use when a boost is given and the optimal 
tumor-bed boost dose-fractionation to use in conjunction 
with HF-WBI have not been determined.” However, the meta-
analysis of RMH/GOC, START A, and START B found that for 
any moderate or marked physician-assessed normal tissue 
effects in the breast significantly favored the HF-WBI arms 
regardless of tumor bed boost. It is noteworthy that the ASTRO 
guideline was published in 2011, before this most recent data 
became available [8]. Kim et al. [20] reported the results of a 
phase II trial of HF-WBI with 39 Gy in 13 fractions of 3 Gy to 
the whole breast once daily over 5 consecutive working days, 
 Review of hypofractionated whole breast irradiation

and 9 Gy in 3 sequential fractions of 3 Gy to the lumpectomy 
cavity, all within 3.2 weeks. They reported excellent disease 
control and tolerable skin toxicity in patients with early-stage 
breast cancer. National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
guidelinestates that“ a boost is recommended in patients 
at higher risk for recurrence with doses of 10–16 Gy in 4–8 
fractions.” 
Radiobiologic Consideration
As abovementioned, a significant accomplishment from the 
RMH/GOC and START A trials is that fractionation sensitivity 
could be evaluated; α/β of the breast tumor and normal 
tissue. These values could vary according to the outcome 
measurement and follow-up periods, as listed in Table 2. Along 
with the RMH/GOC trial, Yarnold et al. [4] reported that α/β is 
4.0 for local control and 3.6 for adverse effects. After a 5 year 
outcome of the START A trial, a meta-analysis with RMH/GOC 
and START A trial showed that the adjusted estimates of α/
β value was 4.6 Gy for tumor control and was 3.4 Gy for late 
change in breast appearance (photographic) [6]. Finally, the 
meta-analysis of RMH/GOC and START A trial after the 10-year 
outcome of the START trial provided an adjusted α/β value 
of 3.5 Gy for local regional relapse [8] and 3.1 Gy for adverse 
effects [21]. 
Another important aspect of HF-WBI irradiation is that the 
irradiated total dose in HF-WBI calculated in EQD2 is slightly 
reduced than that of standard fractionation (Table 1). Yarnold 
et al. [22] pointed out that the curve of normal tissue toxicity 
in the dose-response graph ought to be steeper than the curve 
for subclinical breast tumor control based on the fact that 
local control would be around 70% without radiation whereas 
normal tissue toxicity would be zero without radiation. Hence, 
this leads to small decrease in total dose while allowing 
greater decrease in normal tissue toxicity under the acceptable 
compromise of local control (Fig. 1).
Major concern when using larger fraction size is cardiac 
toxicity. In contrary to common belief that hypofractionation 
has a harmful effect on the heart, it is noteworthy to 
remember that EQD2 of the hypofraction schedule is gentler 
to the heart than conventional fractionation. Even if we regard 
α/β of the heart as an extreme value (i.e., α/β = 1), the mean 
EQD2 dose to the heart in the hypofraction schedule of the 
Canadian trial (42.5 Gy/16 fractions) has a lower value than 
that of the conventional schedule [23].
While key studies focused on the late normal tissue effect

concerning greater fraction size, reports on acute reaction with 
hypofractionation were published recently [24-26]. Because 
the total dose of hypofractionation is slightly lower than 
conventional radiation, the acute skin reaction is expected 
to be much reduced considering the higher value of α/β for 
acute skin reaction. As expected, Jagsi et al. [25] reported that 
patients with hypofraction had lower physician-assessed skin 
reaction, self-reported pain, bothersome burning, bothersome 
pain, bothersome swelling and fatigue. Shaitelman et al. 
[26] also reported lower acute toxic effects and associated 
better quality of life for patient with hypofraction. These 
studies confirmed that HF-WBI provided patients with more 
convenience (from the shorter treatment schedule) and 
reduced acute dermatitis and pain which eventually improved 
quality of life.
Further Consideration
HF-WBI using 15–16 daily treatments has become widely 
accepted in parts of Canada and the UK, but in other country, 
i.e., USA, HF-WBI after BCS has been adopted more slowly 
[27]. Economic realities of a fee-for-service system may have 
contributed to such slow adoption of this technique. As part of 
the ‘Choosing Wisely’ campaign by American Board of Internal 
Medicine, which is intended to avoid wasteful or unnecessary 
medical cost, ASTRO released a list containing the following 
statement: “Don’t initiate whole breast radiotherapy as a 
part of breast conservation therapy in women age >50 years 
with early stage invasive breast cancer without considering 
shorter treatment schedules.” With this effort, adoption of 
hypofractionation is increasing in the USA [28-30].
In Korea, the use of HF-WBI is beginning to increase. 
However, only one report has been published in Korea [20]. 
Under the current national health insurance service system 
in Korea, the cost for SF-WBI with 25 fractions of three-
dimensional (3D) treatment and 5 fractions of electron boost 
is approximately $4,300, whereas HF-WBI with 16 fractions 
of 3D treatment and 3 fractions of electron boost is about 
$2,900 in the year of 2015. Even if we treat HF-WBI with IMRT 
technique, the cost would be $5,700. For the adoption of HF-
WBI, further research such as cost effectiveness analyses or 
pattern of care studies will be needed to demonstrate how HF-
WBI would affect the Korea medical system.
Conclusion
HF-WBI has been proved its effectiveness and safety. The 
50 Gy in 25–28 fractions prescription does not have the 
advantage of convenience for patients nor the advantage of a 
reduced biological effectiveness associated with the ‘extended’ 
fractionation schedule. HF-WBI shows even better late or acute 
radiation toxicity for early breast cancer. But in Korea, further 
investigation to identify the current practice pattern or cost 
effectiveness is warranted under the national health insurance 
service system. In our view, HF-WBI could be new standard for 
whole breast radiotherapy in early breast cancer after BCS.
