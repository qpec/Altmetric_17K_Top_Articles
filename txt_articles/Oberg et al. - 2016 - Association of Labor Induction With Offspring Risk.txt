Abstract
IMPORTANCE—Induction of labor is a frequently performed obstetrical intervention. It would 
thus be of great concern if reported associations between labor induction and offspring risk of 
autism spectrum disorders (ASD) reflected causal influence.
OBJECTIVE—To assess the associations of labor induction with ASD, comparing differentially 
exposed relatives (siblings and cousins discordant for induction).
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS—Follow-up of all live births in Sweden between 
1992 and 2005, defined in the Medical Birth Register. The register was linked to population 
registers of familial relations, inpatient and outpatient visits, and education records. Diagnoses of 
ASD were from 2001 through 2013, and data were analyzed in the 2015–2016 year.
EXPOSURES—Induction of labor.

 MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES—Autism spectrum disorders identified by diagnoses 
from inpatient and outpatient records between 2001 and 2013. Hazard ratios (HRs) quantified the 
association between labor induction and offspring ASD. In addition to considering a wide range of 
measured confounders, comparison of exposure-discordant births to the same woman allowed 
additional control for all unmeasured factors shared by siblings.
RESULTS—The full cohort included 1 362 950 births, of which 22 077 offspring (1.6%) were 
diagnosed with ASD by ages 8 years through 21 years. In conventional models of the full cohort, 
associations between labor induction and offspring ASD were attenuated but remained statistically 
significant after adjustment for measured potential confounders (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.24). 
When comparison was made within siblings whose births were discordant with respect to 
induction, thus accounting for all environmental and genetic factors shared by siblings, labor 
induction was no longer associated with offspring ASD (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE—In this nationwide sample of live births we observed no 
association between induction of labor and offspring ASD within sibling comparison. Our findings 
suggest that concern for ASD should not factor into the clinical decision about whether to induce 
labor.
Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of permanent developmental disabilities 
characterized by impairments in social interaction, language development, along with 
stereotyped and repetitive behaviors; they are estimated to affect approximately 1 in 90 
children in the United States.1 Both genetic and environmental factors in early life are 
thought to be of importance in neurodevelopment.2 Recently, a large, population-based study 
suggested an independent association between induction and augmentation of labor and risk 
of offspring ASD.3 The study linked information on 625 042 live births from the North 
Carolina Detailed Birth Record and the Education Research databases (which included 
information on approximately 5500 children with a documented exceptionality designation 
for ASD). After control for confounding variables, the odds ratio for development of ASD 
following exposure to labor induction and augmentation was 1.27 (95% CI, 1.05–1.52).
Although not the first study to link induction of labor to offspring neurodevelopment,4–6 this 
population-based study gained widespread media attention and sparked a vigorous debate 
among clinicians and researchers. Causal speculation has largely focused on the potential 
role of oxytocin, which is administered to stimulate uterine contractions (in all 
augmentations and a majority of inductions). Oxytocin is a neurotransmitter involved in 
social function and cognition,7 and it has been hypothesized that predelivery exposure could 
predispose to ASD due to a downregulation of oxytocin receptors.8 Alternatively, it may not 
be the method but the intervention per se that increases risk of off spring ASD, by setting off 
down-stream complications with a negative influence on neurodevelopment (eg, fetal 
distress and hypoxia, uterine rupture, emergency cesarean delivery, etc). Importantly, many 
have also argued for noncausal explanations to the findings,9–11 including the possibility that 
dysfunctional labor and ASD neuropathology share genetic origin (calcium homeostasis).12
Understanding whether induction of labor truly confers increased risk of neuropsychiatric 
disorders in the offspring is important to clinicians and patients in weighing the risks and 
benefits of this therapeutic intervention. Herein, we study the association of labor induction

 with ASD in a nationwide register-based birth cohort, with ability to identify differentially 
exposed relatives (siblings and cousins who are discordant with respect to whether their 
births occurred after induction of labor) and to follow up on their diagnosis of ASD. The 
richness of information available through linkage of Swedish population registers allows for 
thorough individual confounder adjustment while the identification of differentially exposed 
relatives (eg, siblings born to same mother, one who was induced for one pregnancy but not 
the other) allows additional adjustment for unmeasured factors shared in families.13
Methods
Data Source and Study Cohort
All residents in Sweden are assigned a unique civic registration number, through which 
individuals can be tracked and linked in national population registries of health and 
demographics.14 The Multi-Generation Register15 links all Swedish residents to their 
parents, adoptive or biological, thereby allowing for the identification of full and half 
siblings, as well as more complex family structures. The Medical Birth Register16 contains 
medical records from antenatal visits and the delivery and pediatric examination of the 
newborn for 96% to 99% of all live births in Sweden since 1973. Women are routinely 
enrolled in antenatal care during weeks 8 through 12, and the midwife uses a standardized 
form to record information such as the mother’s weight and height, sociodemographics (eg, 
age and cohabitation status), reproductive history, use of tobacco smoke, and current and 
previous illnesses. Standardized charts are also used at the time of delivery to record 
information including length of gestation, fetal presentation, onset, and mode of delivery. 
After the delivery, all relevant diagnoses and procedures until discharge are recorded using 
the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD).17 This study 
also made use of the National Patient Register,18 which includes data from all psychiatric 
inpatient visits since 1973, all hospital admissions since 1987, and all specialized outpatient 
care since 2001. Finally, the Education Register at Statistics Sweden allowed assessment of 
the mothers’ highest attained level of education. The institutional review boards at the 
Karolinska Institutet and Indiana University approved the analysis of deidentified data and 
waived informed consent.
Key Points
Question
Is there a causal link between induction of labor and the risk of autism spectrum 
disorders in the offspring?
Findings
This cohort study included all live births in Sweden between 1992 and 2005. When 
examining siblings whose births were discordant with respect to induction, thus 
accounting for environmental and genetic factors shared within families, there was no 
association between induction of labor and offspring risk of autism spectrum disorders.

 These results suggest that the previously reported link between induction and autism is 
unlikely to be causal and should not factor into the clinical decision about whether to 
induce labor.
Labor induction was introduced as a yes-no indicator on the standardized delivery charts 
during 1991. Since 1997, it has been further possible to document through procedure coding 
on the discharge record. Check-box indicators on charts are generally considered to have 
high reliability because they are less likely missed or prone to error than manual recording 
of codes.19,20 Cases of ASD were identified based on the recording of ICD-10 codes (F84: 
Pervasive Developmental Disorders) in National Patient Register records from 2001. These 
diagnoses are set by specialized (ie, not general practice) physicians. Case reviews have 
shown high agreement with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth 
Edition) criteria.21,22 Further face validity may be drawn from finding prevalence estimates 
of ASD based on this type of identification consistent with a large-scale detailed assessment 
from the same period.23
To allow exposure (from 1991) and outcome (up to 2013) identification, the study base 
consisted of the birth cohorts between 1992 and 2005. All live births in the period were 
followed up with respect to neuropsychiatric diagnosis (event), emigration from Sweden, or 
death (right censoring) through the end of 2013 (ages 8–21 years). Missing information 
predominantly occurred for maternal early pregnancy body mass index (BMI, calculated as 
weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, 16%), and smoking status (6%). 
Deletion of individuals with missing information on any of the final covariates of interest 
(mother’s country of origin, education, BMI, and smoking) yielded a sample of 1 117 220 
(82%) available for complete case analysis. Among these, we further identified 694 612 
siblings (bound by mothers) and 323 436 cousins (bound by sisters).
Statistical Analysis
First, we assessed the association between labor induction and ASD graphically, plotting for 
induced and not induced, respectively, the cumulative risk of ASD with age using Kaplan-
Meier estimation. The influence of induction was then modeled in Cox proportional hazard 
regression, with age as the underlying time scale and allowing censoring due to emigration 
or death. To account for clustering arising from the inclusion of more than one offspring per 
woman (siblings), robust standard error estimation was used. With follow-up beginning in 
2001, some in the earlier-born cohorts may be subject to left censoring (with incident 
diagnosis occurring before 2001). Because the majority of (and all severe) affected patients 
are expected to be frequent consumers of psychiatric and medical care, they are very likely 
identified as cases during follow-up, just not capturing the true incident age at diagnosis. To 
account for this, and any concern for birth cohort effects (due to a concomitant rising 
prevalence of induction and diagnoses of neuropsychiatric disorders with time), all analyses 
were adjusted for birth year. All analyses were performed using SAS statistical software 
version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc).
To evaluate the influence of covariates on the association between induction and offspring 
ASD, we performed complete case analysis following an a priori defined modeling strategy

 to sequentially increase the degree of confounder adjustment. The baseline model including 
birth year, parity, and maternal age was expanded with measured stable maternal covariates 
(not likely to vary between consecutive births) such as educational attainment and country of 
origin. Covariates specific to each birth were further added, including smoking status and 
BMI in early pregnancy, multiple gestation, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, 
preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, urogenital infection, premature rupture of membranes, and 
prolonged or high-risk pregnancy. These covariates were selected based on known or 
plausible association with both labor induction and offspring ASD. After fitting each of the 
population-based models, we tested the proportional hazards assumption explicitly by 
evaluating the scaled Schoenfeld residuals for nonzero slope and found no evidence that the 
induction parameter violated the assumption in any of these models. In a final model, we 
then included a fixed effect to allow the underlying hazard to vary between mothers, making 
the contrast within siblings only, while maintaining adjustment for individual-level 
covariates (unique to each birth).
To explore the influence of potential bias, we performed a series of sensitivity analyses. 
First, we repeated all analyses restricted to the cohort born from 1999 through 2005, in 
whom left censoring was less likely. Because the selection to the sibling comparison could 
affect generalizability (representativeness of the population), we assessed whether the cohort 
estimates in each of the first 3 models were different when the sample was restricted to 
individuals who had at least 1 sibling in the cohort. We also compared occurrence of ASD in 
maternal first cousins (offspring of sisters) differentially exposed to labor induction, 
avoiding the requirement of at least 2 births to the same woman. The comparison accounts 
for all factors shared by children of sisters, including some genetic and maternal 
environmental factors. The use of cousins in the fixed effects contrast further allowed us to 
assess all 4 models in firstborn individuals only, to completely exclude any confounding 
influence of birth order. We also performed all analyses after excluding the 6% delivered 
through elective cesarean delivery, which restricts the contrast to reflect those with and 
without indication to induce (comparison being spontaneous start of labor). Last, because a 
majority of missingness was due to mother’s BMI, we performed a complete case analysis 
without consideration of BMI (including 94% of the study base).
Finally, it is important to note that the comparison of relatives would rely solely on the pairs 
(of siblings or cousins) that are discordant with respect to exposure status. In our sample, 
15.2% of all maternal sibling pairs and 18.2% of all maternal cousin pairs were discordant 
for labor induction. With an overall induction prevalence of 12% in this sample, a random 
match of unrelated individuals should produce on average 21% discordance for this obstetric 
intervention. The lower discordance seen among relatives could be due to familial factors 
that make relatives more similar (concordant). In siblings, this could also be counteracted by 
a potential influence of birth order (making siblings different).
Results
Of the 1 362 950 individuals included in the cohort, 22 077 were diagnosed with ASD 
during follow-up. Overall, 11% of all live births in Sweden between 1992 and 2005 were 
preceded by labor induction (with a slight increase over time). Table 1 shows the maternal

 and pregnancy characteristics, stratified by induction status. Comparing distributions, the 
induced deliveries were more likely to occur in later years of the cohort and to women who 
were primiparous, of older age, and of higher BMI than in the general population. Mother’s 
educational status, country of origin, and smoking in early pregnancy did not differ 
substantially across exposure groups (induced and not induced). Labor induction however 
occurred more commonly in association with a number of pregnancy complications, 
including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia. Twenty-three 
percent of all induced pregnancies were postterm (≥42 weeks of gestation), 15% had 
preeclampsia, and 7% had intrauterine growth restriction (Table 1).
The occurrence of ASD in the complete case sample and its relation to labor induction is 
shown graphically in the Figure, in which the cumulative risks of ASD are plotted as a 
function of age, stratified by exposure to induction. An exponential increase in the 
cumulative risk of ASD reflects the increased rate (slope) of discovery/diagnosis with age. 
By the age of 20 years, a little more than 2.5% of the study population had been diagnosed 
with ASD (3.5% among the induced and 2.5% among the non induced).
The main analysis exploring the association between labor induction and ASD is presented 
in Table 2. In the baseline model, labor induction was statistically significantly associated 
with ASD in the full cohort (hazard ratio [HR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.27–1.38). Adjustment for 
stable maternal characteristics including maternal educational level and country of origin 
(model 2) did not substantially change the risk estimate (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.26–1.37). 
After adjustment for all measured factors including stable maternal characteristics and birth-
specific characteristics (model 3), the association was still statistically significant, 
albeitsome what attenuated (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.13–1.24). However, when further 
adjustment was made using fixed-effects models—comparing discordant siblings to each 
other to account for all factors they share (model 4)— labor induction was no longer 
associated with ASD (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.88–1.10).
A series of sensitivity analyses were performed to test the robustness of the findings from 
the main analysis (Table 3). Refitting the models in samples restricted to the later-born 
cohorts or to individuals with 1 or more siblings respectively produced very similar 
estimates as in the full population. Comparison of exposure discordant maternal cousins 
showed attenuation from the fully adjusted cohort model (model 3) although the point 
estimate did not completely reach null as in the sibling analysis. Restriction to first-born 
individuals showed slight attenuation of all estimates, but with an intact pattern of 
statistically significant positive associations in the cohort further attenuated within cousins. 
The exclusion of elective Cesarean deliveries, while leading to slightly stronger cohort 
associations, still showed complete attenuation (no association) in the sibling comparison. 
Lastly, and reassuringly, the complete case analysis excluding only 6% (reintroducing those 
only missing BMI, and not adjusting for this covariate) was nearly identical to the main 
complete case analysis (which excluded 18% of the cohort for missing data; Table 3).

 Discussion
In this large, population-based study from Sweden, using a family comparison design, we 
observed no relationship between induction of labor and offspring ASD. Our findings 
suggest that concern about ASD after induced labor should not factor into the clinical 
decision about whether to induce labor. The results also provide reassurance to parturients, 
that undergoing this common obstetrical intervention will not increase their child’s risk of 
developing this condition.
Consistent with recent prior studies,3,6 we observed a significant crude association between 
induction of labor and the risk of ASD that persisted also after adjustment for measured 
maternal factors and pregnancy conditions that were prespecified as potential confounders. 
However, when we applied a fixed-effects model to compare induction-discordant siblings to 
each other (ie, siblings born to same mother—in one, the labor was induced; in the other, it 
was not), this association was no longer present. The method allowed further control for all 
shared maternal factors (present across all pregnancies) that are unmeasured in registries but 
appear to confound the association between labor induction and neurodevelopmental 
disorders in the offspring. These unmeasured characteristics are likely to have also been 
present in prior studies that observed an association between induction and ASD. Through 
the use of this rich data and innovative, family-based design, we were able to account for 
factors that are not possible to capture using traditional approaches.
Exactly what constitutes the unmeasured factors that lead to residual confounding in 
traditional approaches cannot be directly deduced from our data. The source would have to 
be a common cause of the exposure (labor induction) and outcome (ASD), and further a 
factor that is present across all pregnancies to the same woman. This points to genetic or 
environmental factors that are shared by siblings and confer risk of both labor induction and 
adverse neurodevelopmental outcome. A previous commentary has for example pointed to 
genes involved in cellular calcium homeostasis, which may play a role in the initiation and 
progression of labor, as well as in neurodevelopment.12 A shared environmental factor 
could, speculatively, involve the characteristics of the health care setting where women and 
their offspring are treated; if cared for in a higher-intensity medical system it is possible that 
a woman would be more likely to be induced and her child more likely to be diagnosed with 
a neurodevelopmental disorder than a woman and child treated in a lower-intensity system. 
Because Sweden has a decentralized government-funded health care system with universal 
access, the potential for such differences might, if anything, arise from local variation in 
health care practice.
Our study has a number of strengths. The source population for the analysis encompasses 
nearly all births that occur in Sweden, ensuring that the study is free from selection bias. The 
large size also allows for precise estimates of the association between induction of labor and 
the neurodevelopmental outcomes. The study benefits from the multiple database linkages, 
including information from the Medical Birth Register and the Multi-Generation Register 
that allow for the sibling- and cousin-based designs, and the National Patient Register, which 
allows for the long-term follow-up of offspring for the development of neurodevelopmental 
problems. It uses an innovative analytic approach that does not rely solely on measured

 covariates to account for common causes.24–26 The exposure was identified based on a 
combination of both codes and check boxes in the delivery records, ensuring that it is 
captured with both sensitivity and specificity. Likewise, the approach to identify the outcome 
of ASD has been shown to correlate well with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental 
Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria.
The study is also subject to certain limitations inherent in its data and design. Similar to the 
earlier large population based study reporting an association between induction and ASD3 
our exposure information did not include specification of the type of method used. Contrary 
to this study, we did not have information on labor augmentation. From this follows that our 
findings pertain to the risks associated with induction per se and not the method or 
medication used, hence not specifically testing the proposed biological pathway through 
oxytocin exposure. Although not specifically coded in the delivery charts, given 
contemporary obstetric practice, it is likely that a majority of women whose deliveries were 
induced were exposed to oxytocin (for induction, augmentation, or both), but we also note 
that a proportion of the women with spontaneous start of labor in the comparison group also 
would have been exposed to oxytocin through augmentation. A more important potential 
limitation is that the within-family comparison relied on the selection of discordant family 
members. Although the analysis of discordant relatives allowed for the control for all the 
factors they share, it also meant that the discordance had to be caused by something other 
than the shared factors. If for example, this is due to the influence of unmeasured birth-
specific confounders or misclassification of the exposure, it will bias the within-relative 
comparison. However, because induction is a common obstetric intervention and its 
recording is facilitated by a check-box indicator on the delivery chart, it is likely captured 
with high fidelity. Concern about confounding from unmeasured factors should further be 
ameliorated by the combined adjustment for shared factors and by an extensive list of 
measured birth-specific (individual) confounders (eg, preeclampsia, chorioamnionitis, 
urogenital infection, premature rupture of membranes, prolonged and high-risk pregnancy) 
achieved complete attenuation of the within-sibling comparison.
Conclusions
Using a design that incorporates the comparison of exposure discordant relatives, the 
findings of this study provide no support for a causal association between induction of labor 
and offspring development of ASD.

aFor definition of the models, see the footnotes in Table 2. Model 5 [within cousins]: adjusted for all factors shared by maternal first cousins, and all measured birth-specific covariates.
bRestricted to the later-born cohort, for which follow-up began when offspring were 0 to 4 years of age.
cRestricted to the sample of individuals with at least 1 sibling to the same mother also in the cohort.
dOriginal complete case analysis (from Table 2) adding model 5 to compare the offspring of sisters (maternal first cousins).
eRestricted to all first-born individuals (hence not possible to compare siblings).
fExcluding all elective cesarean deliveries, comparing induction to when labor began spontaneously.
gComplete case analysis without adjusting for BMI (so that only 6% of study base is excluded due to missing data).
