Abstract
Purpose: Investigation of clonal heterogeneity may be key to
understanding mechanisms of therapeutic failure in human
cancer. However, little is known on the consequences of ther-
apeutic intervention on the clonal composition of solid
tumors.
Experimental Design: Here, we used 33 single cell–derived
subclones generated from five clinical glioblastoma specimens for
exploring intra- and interindividual spectra of drug resistance
profiles in vitro. In a personalized setting, we explored whether
differences in pharmacologic sensitivity among subclones could
be employed to predict drug-dependent changes to the clonal
composition of tumors.
Results: Subclones from individual tumors exhibited a remark-
able heterogeneity of drug resistance to a library of potential
antiglioblastoma compounds. A more comprehensive intratu-
moral analysis revealed that stable genetic and phenotypic char-
acteristics of coexisting subclones could be correlated with distinct
drug sensitivity profiles. The data obtained from differential drug
response analysis could be employed to predict clonal population
shifts within the na€
�ve parental tumor in vitro and in orthotopic
xenografts. Furthermore, the value of pharmacologic profiles
could be shown for establishing rational strategies for individu-
alized secondary lines of treatment.
Conclusions: Our data provide a previously unrecognized
strategy for revealing functional consequences of intratumor
heterogeneity by enabling predictive modeling of treatment-
related subclone dynamics in human glioblastoma. Clin Cancer

Introduction
Cellular heterogeneity has traditionally been viewed as a result
of hyperproliferation and increasing genetic instability that, at late
stages of tumor progression, leads to the spawning of subclones
(1, 2). Their phylogeny can be recapitulated, for example, by
applying single-nucleus deep sequencing, regional dissections, or
visualization of specific genetic hallmarks (3–5). On a practical
note, increasing degrees of intratumor heterogeneity are acknowl-
edged as an indicator for unfavorable disease progression/prog-
nosis (6–8), and it is thought that heterogeneity data could have
the potential to influence clinical decision making (9), but this is
not routinely applied in the field yet. One aspect is a lack of
preclinical model systems that could help to better understand the
impact of chemotherapy on clonal heterogeneity. Ideal models

 would have to implement genetic/phenotypic identity of sub-
clones with the respective cellular function for monitoring drug
effects over time in a given tumor (10).
In many of the particularly malignant cancers, for example, the
primary brain tumor glioblastoma, (stem-like) subclones with
intrinsic drug resistance are considered to account for treatment
failure and relapse that inevitably occur during the course of
disease (11–13). Recent insights from in vitro studies on intrain-
dividual drug response suggest that subclones with differential
resistance profiles coexist in glioblastoma (14). Here, we found
that single cell–derived subclones of clinical glioblastoma sam-
ples maintain their distinct phenotypic and genetic identities ex
vivo and that their pharmacologic profiles enable experimental
access to model specific subclone targeting in vitro and in vivo. As a
consequence, drug-related polyclonal population dynamics
becomes predictable. A major further benefit of this approach is
the previously unrecognized feature to identify subclone-specific
drug combinations suited for sequential targeting of coexisting
tumor cell hierarchies, which reflect the foundation of intratumor
heterogeneity.
Materials and Methods
Tissue samples
Tumor tissue was obtained from glioblastoma surgery at the
University of Bonn (BN035-BN118, Bonn, Germany) and the
University of Florida (GNV019, Gainesville, FL, patient details:
Supplementary Table S1). Local ethics committees at both sites
approved the studies, and patients or their guardians provided
informed consent. Tissue diagnosis/grading is based on the WHO
classification (15, 16).
Tissue handling and cell culture
Handling of tissue and cell derivation protocols (BN035-
BN118/GNV019) were described previously (17, 18). Samples
were analyzed at in vitro passages 5 to 13. Subclones derived from
passage 5/6 parental cells were investigated at subsequent in vitro
passages 2 to 8. With the exception of neurosphere and extreme
limiting dilution assays (ELDA), samples were grown adherently
on
laminin
(Life
Technologies)/poly-L-ornithine
(Sigma-
Aldrich)–coated (PO) plasticware (17, 18). Culture methods for
reference/control cells were described: U87(MG) glioma cell line,
hnNCs (human nonmalignant neural cells: short-term expanded
hippocampus-derived adult human neural progenitors; ref. 18),
and hESCdNPs (human ES cell–derived neural progenitor cells;
ref. 19). Cell line authentication was conducted by the DSMZ
using STR analysis, last tested in September 2015 [U87(MG)].
Human primary fibroblasts were provided by Dr. Phillip Koch
and expanded in DMEM/F12 media (Life Technologies) supple-
mented with 10% FCS (Hyclone, GE Healthcare) and 1% anti-
biotic-antimycotic. All investigated cells tested mycoplasma neg-
ative per standard cell lysate PCR detection. For in vitro growth
kinetics, populations doublings (PD) were calculated: n ¼ 3.32
(log UCY – log l) þ X, where n ¼ final PD number at the end of
given subculture; UCY ¼ cell yield at that point; I ¼ cell number
used as inoculum of subculture; X ¼ doubling level of inoculum
used to initiate the quantified subculture. The neurosphere assay
testing cellular differentiation was applied as described previously
(17, 20).For the ELDA, GNV019 cells plated in a volume of 150 mL
on ultralow attachment 96-well plates (Corning) in decreasing
numbers for 7 days were incubated with Calcein AM viability dye
(5 mmol/L) for 30 minutes to label vital cells and for fluorescence-
based quantification of tumor spheres.
Derivation of tumor subclones
Passage 5 GNV019 cells were plated at 15 cells/cm2 on five PO-
coated 10-cm dishes. Twenty individual cells per dish were
randomly selected on the subsequent day, marked with pen at
the bottom of the dish, and followed for 30 to 60 days. Seven of
these formed clonal colonies, were selected using 8-mm cloning
cylinders (Corning), trypsinized, and transferred to a 6-cm dish
for expansion. CL1/2/3/6/7 cells were depicted from these based
on their distinctive morphologies. BN samples were plated at 0.5
cells per well in up to eight 96-well plates, validated, and mon-
itored throughout clonal expansion by automated image-based
analysis (Cellavista, Roche). Eleven to 26 single cell–derived
subclones were selected per case and expanded. For generation
of pilot data, at least 5 subclones were used per patient sample.
Compound screening and treatment
Reference/control cells, parental tumor cells, and subclones
were seeded in 96-well plates at 5–13 � 103 cells/cm2 in tripli-
cates. Twenty-four hours later, drugs were applied as 10� stock
dilutions. Cellular viability was determined as the ratio of back-
ground-subtracted alamarBlue (Life Technologies) fluorescence
intensities of treated and vehicle control cells. Compounds of the
pilot drug screen (Supplementary Table S2) were applied in six
different concentrations to determine dose–response levels. Four
days later, cellular viability was compared with vehicle applica-
tions [0.55% DMSO for compounds combined with 50 mmol/L
temozolomide; 1.5% DMSO for temozolomide treatment alone;
0.5% ethanol (EtOH) for perifosine, and 0.5% DMSO for all other
drugs]. The "Killer Plates" compound library (MicroSource) was
applied to GNV019 cells at 1 mmol/L concentrations each and
compared with vehicle controls (0.01% DMSO) at 5 days after
treatment. IC50 evaluation for selected compounds was per-
formed as described previously (18).
For coculture, subclones were labeled with green (CellTracker
Green CMFDA, 5 mmol/L, or Vybrant DiO, 1:200) or red fluores-
cent dyes (CellTracker Red CMTPX, 25 mmol/L, or Vybrant DiD,
Translational Relevance
Inevitably recurring tumor growth complicates even the
most promising pharmacotherapies in glioblastoma. Arguing
that coexisting cellular hierarchies contributing to pharmaco-
resistance are extractable from clinical samples, we here show
that phenotypic and genetic stability of intratumor subclones
enables controlled and discriminative drug profiling ex vivo.
Our data imply that the respective profiles are directly appli-
cable to predict intratumoral treatment-induced clonal pop-
ulation shifts in vitro and in vivo, and thus to predict the cellular
composition of relapsing human cancer tissue at the time of
primary diagnosis. In addition, we show that pharmacologic
profiles could serve as a valuable asset for defining combina-
torial secondary lines of treatment. Further development of
this strategy may be key to the understanding of therapeutic
failure, and it may become a sophisticated evidence-based
planning tool for personalizing therapy in glioblastoma.

 1:200, all Life Technologies) for 30 minutes. Equal quantities of
green- and red-labeled cells were seeded on 12-well plates. CL1/2/
3/6/7 cells were treated with 10 mmol/L thioguanine, 2 mmol/L
oridonin, 4 mmol/L sorafenib, 1 mmol/L cantharidin, or 0.1%
DMSO for 5 days. BN035 subclones were treated with 0.4 nmol/L
bortezomib, 8 mmol/L lonafarnib (þ50 mmol/L temozolomide),
or 0.25% DMSO. BN046 subclones were treated with 3 mmol/L
17-AAG, 10 mmol/L etoposide (þ50 mmol/L temozolomide), or
0.15% DMSO for 3 days. Challenged cells were trypsinized for
flow cytometry using 15–20 � 103 cells (FACSCalibur Cell Ana-
lyzer; BD Biosciences) to determine drug effects.
For subclone selection from parental GNV019 cells, increasing
concentrations of thioguanine or 0.1% DMSO were applied for
5 days, followed by a 4-day growth factor withdrawal-induced
differentiation period, before quantifying (giant) multinucleated
cells. CL2-like cells were selected by single- or repeated treatment
with 4 mmol/L sorafenib for 5 days. For subclone selection from
BN035 and BN046 parental cells, drugs were applied in two 3-day
cycles at concentrations indicated (Supplementary Figs. S5B and
S6B). Sequential treatment (5 þ 5 days for all) of GNV019 cells
(Fig. 6) was either conducted with 10 mmol/L thioguanine/0.1%
DMSO (first line), followed by 20 mmol/L perifosine, 1.5 mmol/L
SAHA (þ50 mmol/L temozolomide), 3 mmol/L sunitinib, 0.5
nmol/L bortezomib, 100 nmol/L dasatinib, or 0.12% DMSO
(second line). The alternative course included 4 mmol/L sorafe-
nib/0.02% DMSO (first line), followed by 1 mmol/L cantharidin,
20 mmol/L imatinib, 0.5 mmol/L etoposide (þ50 mmol/L temo-
zolomide), 0.2% DMSO, 1 mmol/L temozolomide, or 1% DMSO
(control condition for temozolomide alone; second line).
Orthotopic xenograft experiments and animal treatments
Ethical Committees of the Universities of Bonn and Florida
approved all animal studies. For engraftment, cells were har-
vested, counted, and resuspended in 0.1% DNase I (Worthing-
ton)/PBS (Life Technologies). Cell vitality was confirmed via
Trypan blue exclusion. Two microliters encompassing 1 � 105
cells were stereotactically applied to the brains of Fox Chase SCID/
beige mice (females, 9–13 weeks old; 1.6 mm anterior, 1.9 mm
lateral to the bregma, 1.4 mm deep from the dura; Charles River
Laboratories). In addition to presented data, tumorigenicity and
cellular characteristics of GNV019 parental and subclonal cells
were confirmed in NMRI nu/nu mice (females, 6–10 weeks old;
n ¼ 2, each; 2.2 mm anterior, 1.3 mm lateral, 1.7 mm deep; Janvier
Labs). Mice were monitored daily and euthanized when signs of
neurologic impairment or significant weight loss (�20% from
preoperative weight) were noted. For routine histology, brains
were fixed by vascular perfusion (4% formaldehyde). Coronal
gradient echo, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recov-
ery MRI data were obtained from formaldehyde-fixed whole
brains using the core facility of the McKnight Brain Institute
(University of Florida, Gainesville, FL) under standard imaging
protocols with a 15-mm birdcage coil and 11-T horizontal-bore
magnet (Bruker).
In vivo analysis of subclone enrichment commenced at day 42
postorthotopic xenotransplantation of GNV019 parental cells. A
2.5 mg/mL stock solution of thioguanine (50 mg thioguanine/20
mL of 0.02 mol/L NaOH) generated doses of 10 mg/kg per
injection and was applied for 3 consecutive days (21). A total of
100 mg sorafenib dissolved in 2.5 mL Kolliphor/EtOH (50:50,
Sigma-Aldrich) to obtain a 4� stock solution was further diluted
in ddH2O. Treatments (100 mg/kg) were conducted on 5 days per
week (22). Sorafenib-induced population shifts were assessed
using DNA from 5 of 8 animals of the experimental series (2�
Kolliphor/EtOH, 3� sorafenib). Three of 8 samples were excluded
because sufficient DNA quantity/quality could not be obtained:
two samples representing prenecrotic brain tissue of animals that
died over night; one sample failed DNA extraction.
Immunocytochemistry
Paraformaldehyde-fixed cells and formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-
embedded tissues were supplied with primary antibodies against
bIII-tubulin (Promega; monoclonal mouse, clone 5G8, 1:1,000),
GFAP (DAKO; polyclonal rabbit, #Z0334, 1:600), pan-cadherin
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, polyclonal rabbit; #PA5-19479, 1:200),
and a-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, monoclonal mouse; clone DM1A;
1:1,000) overnight at 4�C. Respective antigens were labeled by
incubation with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies
(Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG 1:800 and Alexa Fluor
555 goat anti-rabbit IgG 1:500, Life Technologies) for 1 hour at
room temperature. Cell nuclei were exposed with 2 mg/mL DAPI
(Sigma Aldrich) for 10 minutes. Fluorescence microscopy was
performed on a Zeiss Axioskop2 or Axio Imager.Z1 upright
microscope. Frequencies of multinucleated giant cells (mGC; in
vivo) and mGC-like multinucleated cells (mnCells; in vitro) were
determined by quantifying mono- versus multinucleated cells in
respective samples using DAPI and a-tubulin (in vitro) or pan-
cadherin (in vivo) labeling. Quantification was conducted by
averaging the results of at least two investigators (R. Reinartz,
L. Rauschenbach, and B. Scheffler) blinded to the experimental
conditions.
Molecular biology
DNA/RNA was isolated using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit
(Qiagen) following the manufacturer's instructions. Chromo-
somal aberrations were analyzed using Illumina's BeadChips
(HumanHap550/Human610-Quad). Sample preparation was
performed according to Illumina's Infinium protocols. For
whole-genome gene expression profiling, total RNA of biological
triplicates was extracted using QIAzol Lysis Reagent (Qiagen) and
analyzed using HumanHT-12 v3 expression BeadChips (Illu-
mina). Gene expression and genotyping data were deposited at
GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus: accession numbers GSE72927,
GSE72732). TP53 mutation screening was performed according
to the direct sequencing protocol of the International Agency for
Research on Cancer (Lyon, France). DNA copy numbers were
quantified on a ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies)
using SYBR Green. PCR cycling conditions are as follows: 95�C for
3 minutes, followed by 40 cycles at 95�C for 20 seconds, 60�C for
20 seconds, and 72�C for 30 seconds. Ct values for target genes on
Chr. 1 (CDKN2C), Chr. 5 (SCAMP1, CHD1), and Chr. 22 (BID,
NF2) were normalized using Ct values of the Chr. 2 reference
genes (MEMO1 and ASB3). Copy number values were calculated
using the DDCt method on tumor samples and human leukocyte
DNA as reference. Gene expression analysis of signature neural
stem-like genes was performed as described previously (18) using
1 mg total RNA (for primers, see Supplementary Table S3). Custom
multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) kits
(P345-X1 & P346-X1; MRC-Holland) were used to detect copy
number alterations in BN035 and BN046 cells. A total of 90 ng
DNA from tumor cells or from (two individual) reference human
leukocyte DNA was used for each MLPA reaction. Fragment
separation was performed on a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied

ware (MRC-Holland).
Bioinformatics and statistical analysis
Hierarchical clustering, calculation of Pearson correlation coef-
ficients, heatmaps, and logR ratio plots were performed using R-
project statistical software (v3.0.2; ref. 23). Molecular subtypes of
GNV019 samples were classified as "neural" (according to ref. 24).
Cluster dendrograms were created using Euclidean distance and
average linkage analysis. All other computations were carried
out using GraphPad Prism 6.0f and Microsoft Excel. Where
applicable, the two-tailed Student t test (assuming equal var-
iances), the one-way ANOVA with Tukey correction for multiple
comparisons, or the two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons were performed for statistical anal-
ysis. Standard distribution of data was applied for respective
tests. Data analysis is based on biological triplicates, unless
otherwise specified. Unless otherwise indicated, data are pre-
sented as mean � SD (levels of significance: �, P < 0.05; ��, P <
0.01; ���, P < 0.001; ����, P < 0.0001). Cartoons were produced
using SERVIER Medical Art.
Results
Drug–response profiles of tumor subclones reflect intra- and
interindividual tumor heterogeneity
In pilot experiments, we explored single cell–derived (sub-
clonal) cultures from clinical patient samples to display het-
erogeneity of drug–response patterns. On the basis of reported
transcriptome analysis of 430 single cells from 5 glioblastoma
patients (25), we expected patterns of strong interindividual
differences and a considerable degree of intratumor heteroge-
neity. In a parallel constellation, we applied short-term
expanded primary cell cultures from five glioblastoma patients
and, additionally, a total of 33 respective subclones for anal-
ysis of differential drug response. All cells were maintained
under adherent in vitro conditions suited for the expansion of
neural stem- and precursor cells (Materials and Methods).
Twenty clinical trial grade drugs and compounds (Supplemen-
tary Table S2) were used to determine IC50 values, that is, the
individual concentrations that reduced cellular viability by
50% compared with vehicle control treatments. Hierarchical
clustering of data revealed an extent and pattern of heteroge-
neity comparable with the transcriptome data presented by
Patel and colleagues (25). A strong interindividual variability
was noted as well as substantial intraindividual differences of
drug–response patterns (Fig. 1). Notably, for each of the five
cases, the median drug concentration difference between the
most and least resistant subclone revealed a 2-fold intraindi-
vidual variability of drug response among all investigated
compounds (Supplementary Fig. S1, mean factor, 2.32; range,
1.86–2.92).
Thus, data from our test system indicated considerable varia-
tion of drug responsiveness among intratumor subclones, adding
another level of complexity to the interindividual differences
that are commonly acknowledged in the biology of glioblastoma

 (24, 26). These pilot data, however, also raised questions: on one
hand related to the overall range of potentially coexisting sub-
clones and intraindividual drug–response profiles; on the other
hand, it was unclear to what degree the subclones maintain their
distinct phenotypic and genetic identities ex vivo and whether the
determined variability of drug response would impact on the
cellular composition of a tumor bulk upon treatment. We prior-
itized investigation of the latter complex of questions, because the
range of intratumor response profiles would be irrelevant if
significant alterations to the cellular composition of the tumor
bulk would not occur.
Morphologic, genetic, and functional traits of tumor subclones
are preserved in vitro and in vivo
Previous studies already demonstrated that patient- and
disease-specific hallmarks of glioblastoma could be mirrored
ex vivo for experimental investigation (17, 18, 27). For exper-
imental access to studying consequences of clonal diversity,
we selected the case GNV019 that presented with a charac-
teristic morphologic trait of heterogeneity: mGCs. Their pres-
ence is not an obligatory finding, but rare mGCs are frequently
observed in glioblastoma (16). Histopathology of the patient's
tumor accordingly revealed very few (�1%) mGCs intermixed
with other pleomorphic smaller cell phenotypes (Fig. 2A).
Morphologic heterogeneity was similarly observed when pri-
mary GNV019 cells were isolated and propagated under
adherent conditions (Fig. 2B; ref. 20). The cellular expansion
rate remained stable, and the disease- and patient-specific gene
expression-/copy number profiles were conserved in vitro (Fig.
2C–E; refs. 28, 29). Orthotopic xenotransplantation demon-
strated a tumorigenic potential replicating the original tumor's
glioblastoma histology, including the presence of intermixed,
rare mGCs (2.1 � 1.1%; n ¼ 11; Fig. 2F, G, and I). We next
investigated subclones (CL1/2/3/6/7) derived from early-pas-
sage parental GNV019 cells (Fig. 2H, top). They presented
common genomic profiles with only a few differential copy
number alterations (Supplementary Fig. S2), and similar to
the parental samples, they each classified as "neural" subtype
(24).
Notably,
however,
orthotopic
xenotransplantation
revealed distinct categories of in vivo behavior. CL2 cells were
not tumorigenic (n ¼ 11/11). The other subclones consistently
developed histopathologic features of glioblastoma (16), yet
their
cellular
composition
varied.
CL7-derived
tumors
appeared "small cell-enriched": most tumor cells were uni-
formly small and round, mGCs extremely rare (0.2 � 0.2%;
n ¼ 8). In contrast, CL1/3/6-derived tumors presented high
mGC frequencies (32.8 � 9.3%; n ¼ 8/7/10; Fig. 2H, bottom,
and I).
We concluded that GNV019 disease- and patient-specific char-
acteristics were preserved ex vivo and that isolation of tumor
subclones enabled functional access to distinguishable morpho-
logic characteristics of the parental tumor.
Subclone phenotypes present distinct developmental and
genetic traits
We next explored whether the distinct categories of in vivo
behavior reflected distinct patterns of cellular plasticity, gene
expression, and genetic aberrations. In vitro, the subclones con-
sistently revealed stem-like developmental potentials, that is, 5 of
5 were able to self-renew (Supplementary Fig. S3) and to differ-
entiate into neuronal and glial progeny (Fig. 3A, top). Notably, a
pronounced capacity to also generate (giant) mnCells upon
spontaneous differentiation in vitro that resembled mGCs in vivo
was only observed in CL1/3/6 cells matching their developmental
potential in xenografts (Fig. 3A, bottom). Moreover, analysis of
signature neural stem-like genes (FABP7, OTX2, SOX9, BMI1,
SOX2, VIM, NOTCH2, VCAM1, NES, NCAM1, SOX8, and FGFR4)
indicated distinct expression motives separating nontumorigenic
CL2 cells from tumorigenic mGC-forming CL1/3/6, and from
tumorigenic "small cell-enriching" CL7 cells (Supplementary Fig.
S4). Unsupervised clustering of correlation data from genome-
wide gene expression and in-depth genotype analysis further
confirmed the specific hierarchic alignment of GNV019 subclones
(Fig. 3B).
In synthesis, findings indicated consistently distinct mor-
phologic, developmental, and genetic traits of the investi-
gated GNV019 subclones in vitro and in vivo, serving as an
ideal basis to reveal functional consequences of intratumor
heterogeneity.
Distinct pharmacologic response patterns enable selection of
subclones by in vitro drug challenge
The specific alignment of CL1/3/6, CL2, and CL7, as deter-
mined in the functional and molecular classification experiments
above, corresponded directly to the drug response profiles of
GNV019-derived subclones of our pilot data (Fig. 1). This encour-
aged further investigation toward pharmacologic targeting of
distinct subclones. To broaden the approach and for experimental
validation, we additionally applied a commercial library com-
prising 160 synthetic/natural compounds, previously used for
identification of new drug candidates in glioblastoma (18).
Hierarchical clustering of the respective cellular viability data
further confirmed the specific alignment of CL1/3/6, CL2, and
CL7 (Fig. 4A).
Together, data suggested that the five investigated GNV019
subclones represented three independent intratumor cell hierar-
chies separating coexisting precursor cells and their descendants
by functional, phenotypic, and genetic traits. We hypothesized
that these hierarchies needed to be considered as functionally
distinct intratumor cell populations with independent drug resis-
tance profiles. On the basis of this assumption and the noted
stability of subclones ex vivo, we opted for discriminative inves-
tigation and modeling of intratumor population dynamics using
GNV019 cells as an experimental system. The approach was
initiated by determining the most suitable drugs for pharmaco-
logic hierarchy selection, chosen from both sets of compound
screening data (Fig. 4B). Subsequent pharmacodynamic analysis
established drug concentrations with most pronounced effects.
The highest differential level of intrinsic drug resistance was
defined at 10 mmol/L thioguanine (synthetic guanosine analogue
antimetabolite, inhibits nucleic acid synthesis) for CL1/3/6 and at
2 mmol/L oridonin (mechanism of action not yet fully under-
stood) for CL7 cells. CL2 cells could be discriminated from all
others by their sensitivity to 1 mmol/L cantharidin (PP2A inhib-
itor) and by their resistance to 4 mmol/L sorafenib (multikinase
inhibitor, see Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 4C). To test the drugs'
applicability for pharmacologic selection, defined mixtures of
fluorescently prelabeled subclones were exposed in coculture to
a single drug dose, and their respective population shifts were
evaluated by flow cytometry 5 days later (Fig. 4D and E). Com-
parison with vehicle controls confirmed the predicted targeting of
distinct subclones/hierarchies. The resulting mean population

 shifts were determined at 20 � 3% in response to in vitro drug
challenge (Fig. 4F).
Intratumoral, treatment-related population dynamics can be
predicted in vitro
The aforementioned, reductionist coculture experiments sug-
gested that the ratios of intratumoral subclone fractions could be
selectively modulated depending on the choice of drug used for
pharmacologic challenge. In the next series of experiments, we
aimed to show that this could be applied to the more complex
setting of parental GNV019 cells.
In the first approach, parental cells were considered as a
polyclonal collection of precursors either responsible for (e.g.,
thioguanine-resistant CL1/3/6-like cells) or incapable of mGC/
mnCell
generation
(e.g.,
thioguanine-sensitive
CL2/7-like
cells; Fig. 5A). The morphologic trait of mGC/mnCell generation
was used as a read-out parameter to quantify the extent of
pharmacologic selection. Application of thioguanine to GNV019
parental cells and subsequent differentiation in vitro indeed
yielded upto 5-fold concentration-dependent increases of mnCell
fractions (Fig. 5B). The corresponding increases correlated with

 investigation of CL1/3/6 and parental cells (Fig. 5C and D,
compare Fig. 4C). In a control setting, we confirmed that thio-
guanine alone did not induce the mnCell phenotype, as its
application did not alter the capability of CL2 or CL7 cells to
develop the phenotype in vitro (Fig. 5E). We concluded that, as
predicted, thioguanine selectively enriched CL1/3/6-like cells
from the GNV019 parental cells. The second approach was based
on the presence of a distinctive, 36-megabase deletion in CL2 cells
on chromosome 5q (Fig. 5F). Used as a read-out parameter, a
decreased abundance of this chromosomal region would indicate
an increased fraction of CL2-like cells within the GNV019 parental
cells (Fig. 5G). The extent of pharmacologic selection was then
determined by quantifying copy numbers of genes within the
CL2-specific deletion. As predicted, sorafenib exposure led to
dose-dependent copy number decreases, indicating an enrich-
ment of CL2-like cells from GNV019 parental cells (Fig. 5H,
compare Fig. 4C).
These data implied that pharmacologic profiling of subclones
could blueprint post hoc identification of individual cell hierar-
chies in a heterogeneous parental tumor sample. To validate
whether this insight could be applied to other glioblastoma
specimens, we investigated 14 additional subclones from two
more clinical samples of our pilot dataset (Fig. 1), adopting the
experimental course established on GNV019 cells. Briefly, BN035-
and BN046 subclones underwent MLPA analysis for identification
of specific genetic marks (Materials and Methods), selection of
subclone-specific drugs from pharmacologic profiles, respective
validation in coculture, and successful tracking of predicted sub-
clone enrichment in parental tumor samples (Supplementary
Figs. S5 and S6). The consistency of experimental results from
all three investigated clinical samples led us conclude that intra-
tumoral, treatment-related cellular population dynamics is pre-
dictable, based on discriminative investigation of drug responses
under controlled in vitro conditions.
Intratumoral, treatment-related population dynamics can be
predicted in vivo
Next, orthotopic xenotransplantation validated predictability
of drug-induced polyclonal dynamics in vivo. Treatments of ani-
mals engrafted with 105 GNV019 parental cells commenced at
day 42, when intracerebral glioblastoma characteristics had
already developed (compare Fig. 2F and G). Intraperitoneal
vehicle injections yielded a median overall survival (mOS) of
60.5 days (n ¼ 3, each; Fig. 5I).
The established morphologic/genetic read-out parameters were
then used to verify thioguanine/sorafenib–induced enrichment of
distinct hierarchies, that is, CL1/3/6-like or CL2-like cells. Both
drugs indeed induced the predicted population shifts, indepen-
dent of their influence on mOS. Thioguanine applications were
limited to three injections due to potential myelotoxicity (n ¼ 6
animals; intraperitoneal; 21) and did not extend the mOS of
engrafted animals (Fig. 5I). Nevertheless, a significant 2.8-fold
increase of mGCs indicated a treatment-related population shift
as predicted (P ¼ 0.0149; Fig. 5J). In the parallel experiment,
sorafenib applications (n ¼ 5 animals; intraperitoneal, dose
according to ref. 22) extended the mOS significantly to 74 days
(P ¼ 0.0042; Fig. 5I). Microdissected tumor tissue from these
animals then provided evidence for an increasing population size
of CL2-like cells, as predicted. Quantifying copy numbers of genes
in the CL2-specific region of deletion on chromosome 5q revealed
a significant decrease from 2.03 � 0.05 (vehicle) to 1.83 � 0.06
(sorafenib; P ¼ 0.029; Fig. 5K).
Implications of predictable population dynamics for second-
line treatment strategies
In the last series of experiments, we investigated whether
information from ex vivo pharmacologic profiling and prediction
of subclone enrichment could be applied to the design of rational
drug combinations. We hypothesized that one drug could be used

 in a first-line setting to drive the heterogeneous parental tumor
bulk toward enrichment of particular subclones/hierarchies with
distinct sensitivities to a choice of second-line drugs. The hypoth-
esis was tested in two settings on GNV019 parental cells, imple-
menting pharmacologic profiles as planning tools (Fig. 6A and C).
In setting one, we observed enrichment of CL1/3/6-like cells with
thioguanine, rendering the parental tumor bulk significantly
more vulnerable to perifosine, SAHA þ temozolomide, or suni-
tinib, which were predicted particularly effective on CL1/3/6 cells
by the initial profiling. In contrast, drugs with minor inhibitory
effects on CL1/3/6 cells in the initial profiling, for example,
bortezomib and dasatinib, showed a less pronounced effect on
bulk tumor cells secondary to thioguanine application (Fig. 6A
and B). In setting two, enrichment of CL2-like cells with sorafenib
required cantharidin for more effective second-line inhibition. As
predicted from CL2 profiling, imatinib, etoposide þ temozolo-
mide, and temozolomide were less appropriate second-line com-
binations for sorafenib (Fig. 6C and D). In a control arm for both
sets of experiments, we could furthermore show that these effects
were exclusive to the parental bulk of tumor cells (Supplementary
Fig. S7).
We conclude that ex vivo drug profiling of tumor subclones can
facilitate predictions on treatment-related population dynamics
and that rational drug combinations for sequential application in
glioblastoma can be identified.
Discussion
Our study considers glioblastoma as a polyclonal collection of
potent cellular hierarchies, at least at clinical manifestation of
disease. The concept combines classic stochastic and cancer stem
cell models (2, 12), implying that subclones with distinct intrinsic
resistance profiles coexist in tumor specimens. Although poor or
short-lasting therapy responses still occur in most glioblastoma

 patients, we here show the applicability of discriminative ex vivo
drug profiling of subclones from clinical samples. A previously
unrecognized feasibility is revealed, enabling predictions on
intratumoral drug response and the resulting population shifts
in bulk tumor samples. This note has important implications,
particularly in light of the additional finding that pharmacologic
profiles could serve as a valuable asset for defining appropriate
drug combinations for individualized sequential application.
The roots of our work are classic cell culture studies describing
intratumoral diversity of karyotypes, phenotypes, and pharma-
cologic responses in human glioma (30–32), recently revisited by
investigating patterns of receptor tyrosine kinase amplifications
and their respective functional dependence in vitro (33). Taking
advantage of stem/precursor culture conditions that enable main-
tenance of phenotypic and genetic properties, we demonstrate
that isolated subclones are amenable for profiling and for

Implications of predictable population dynamics for second-line treatment strategies. A, Ternary plotsvisualize the pharmacologic profiling data of the three GNV019
hierarchies in a two-dimensional plot (IC50 values, average data for CL1/3/6; compare Fig. 1 and Fig 4C; Supplementary Fig. S1). Every data point represents the
positioning of a tested drug in relation to the respective cellular hierarchies. A drug that plots in close proximity to an edge in the graph has a strong
inhibitory effect on the respective hierarchy and little effects on the others. Increasing distance from a corner implies decreasing sensitivity of the drug toward the
respective hierarchy. For the first-line setting of thioguanine-based enrichment of CL1/3/6-like cells, second-line drugs were chosen as indicated in the plot: sunitinib,
perifosine, and SAHA þ temozolomide (TMZ) plotted close to the CL1/3/6 hierarchy, thus predicted highly effective sequential partners. Bortezomib (light gray) and
dasatinib (dark gray) were predicted less effective. B, Investigations on GNV019 parental cells: graph representing data from sequential application of thioguanine/
DMSO, followed by the chosen drugs from A. Note the high consistency of predictions on effectiveness of second-line drug applications. C, For the first-line
setting of sorafenib-based enrichment of CL2-like cells, second-line drugs were chosen as indicated in the plot: cantharidin plotted close to the CL2 hierarchy and thus

 predictions on drug-related intratumoral dynamics. The impor-
tance of investigating alterations to the cellular composition
of solid cancers before and after treatment is being increas-
ingly revealed (e.g., refs. 34, 35). Drug-related enrichments of
primary resistant cell types may even include minority cellular
hierarchies of the original tumor (36, 37). This could be
recapitulated in our model by the significant drug-related
enrichment of CL1/3/6-like or CL2-like GNV019 hierarchies.
We observed the effect even occurring independent of a
survival benefit in xenografts. A logical next step for future
follow-up would be a study on matched clinical samples
obtained before and after treatment to provide unequivocal
evidence that predictable drug-related clonal selection occurs
in glioblastoma patients. We already know that successful
eradication of targeted neoplastic cells cannot prevent the
cells that were not targeted to develop fatal relapse (e.g.,
ref. 38). Predictable population dynamics could serve as a
valuable asset on these grounds for defining appropriate
secondary lines of treatment. It might even be essential,
because secondary surgery cannot always be performed in
glioblastoma, and current practice of care frequently considers
rechallenge of first-line pharmacotherapy for treating relapsed
disease (39).
It needs to be emphasized, however, that our approach focused
on the feature of primary/intrinsic resistance. Further investiga-
tion may be directed, for example, toward acquired drug resis-
tance and potential subclone interactions, as well as toward
environmental and immunologic cues for a more comprehensive
view (12, 40–42). Some of these factors, in addition to animal
model–inherent obstacles, including potentially suboptimal drug
dosage/pharmacokinetics/distribution, might already explain the
lower efficacy of in vivo versus in vitro subclone enrichment
observed in our study. Another restriction may apply to condi-
tions for derivation and expansion of clinical samples. Although
our work shows how cellular heterogeneity can be captured and
how cellular identity can remain stable under adherent condi-
tions, it is known that any setting of primary cell culture may
inflict selection bias on patient tissue and cells (e.g., ref. 43).
Thus, even though we present data on drug-mediated enrich-
ment of 19 subclones from three clinical specimens, sufficient
data are not available for a statistically valid extrapolation of
clonal diversity. This could be addressed in future, for example,
by introducing artificial DNA barcodes to the entire population,
facilitating quantification of individual subclones in the tumor
bulk (44).
Our study furthermore provides tools for individualizing med-
icine, for example, specifying how subclone drug profiles could
help to foster translational studies and more personalized
approaches addressing the functional consequences of intratu-
mor heterogeneity (see Supplementary Fig. S8). In our study,
ternary plots serve as schematic representations of subclone drug
profiles. They correlate the degree of drug sensitivity among
coexisting tumor cell hierarchies in a two-dimensional plot.
Applied as a planning tool, suited pairs of drugs can be identified
that drive the heterogeneous parental tumor bulk toward enrich-
ment of a particular subclone/hierarchy during first-line applica-
tion and that aim for depletion of this hierarchy in the second-line
approach. Granted that future developments in clinical medicine
will improve upon many of the technical aspects of our work, for
example, toward a more complete mirroring of subclone hetero-
geneity from clinical specimens, our approach could provide the
rationale for personalizing sequential therapy in glioblastoma.
For basic sciences, the approach could enable investigation of
potential relationships between drug-specific mechanisms of
actions, differential drug sensitivities, and the various molecular
signatures provided by intratumor hierarchies. Also, preclinical
limitations, for example, inflicted by combinatorial versus
sequential drug application, could be studied in a reductionist
setting.
Taken together, our observations support accumulating evi-
dence from the study of many malignant types of cancer and
the notion that population-level methods could underestimate
clinically relevant information (3–5, 14, 36, 45). Pharmaco-
logic predictions on tumor dynamics would smoothly inte-
grate into the intense ongoing search for new and alternative
pharmacotherapy options, particularly needed in the setting
of defining individualized second-line treatment strategies.
Combined with advanced genetic diagnostics and driven by
the high medical need in glioblastoma, this strategy might
become an essential tool for precision medicine and clinical
trial design (9).
