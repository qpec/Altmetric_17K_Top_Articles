There are profound sex differences in the incidence of many
psychiatric disorders. Although these disorders are frequently linked
to social stress and to deficits in social engagement, little is known
about sex differences in the neural mechanisms that underlie these
phenomena. Phenotypes characterized by dominance, competitive
aggression, and active coping strategies appear to be more resilient
to psychiatric disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
compared with those characterized by subordinate status and the
lack of aggressiveness. Here, we report that serotonin (5-HT) and
arginine–vasopressin (AVP) act in opposite ways in the hypothalamus
to regulate dominance and aggression in females and males. Hypo-
thalamic injection of a 5-HT1a agonist stimulated aggression in fe-
male hamsters and inhibited aggression in males, whereas injection
of AVP inhibited aggression in females and stimulated aggression in
males. Striking sex differences were also identified in the neural
mechanisms regulating dominance. Acquisition of dominance was
associated with activation of 5-HT neurons within the dorsal raphe
in females and activation of hypothalamic AVP neurons in males.
These data strongly indicate that there are fundamental sex differ-
ences in the neural regulation of dominance and aggression. Further,
because systemically administered fluoxetine increased aggression
in females and substantially reduced aggression in males, there may
be substantial gender differences in the clinical efficacy of commonly
prescribed 5-HT–active drugs such as selective 5-HT reuptake inhib-
itors. These data suggest that the treatment of psychiatric disorders
such as PTSD may be more effective with the use of 5-HT–targeted
drugs in females and AVP-targeted drugs in males.

P
rominent sex differences occur in the incidence, development,
and clinical course of many psychiatric disorders. Women, for
example, have higher rates of depression and anxiety disorders
such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), whereas men more
frequently suffer from autism and attention deficit disorders (1–4).
Because little is known about sex differences in the efficacy of
treatments for these disorders, current treatment strategies are
largely the same for both sexes. The development of effective
treatments for both women and men can proceed with a clear
understanding of sex differences in the mechanisms and etiology
of psychiatric disorders. Many of these disorders are linked to
deficits in adaptive social skills (5, 6); therefore, understanding
the neural mechanisms underlying social engagement in both
sexes is essential. In most mammalian species, social interactions
among both sexes are governed by dominance relationships. As
such, behaviors associated with these relationships (e.g., social
recognition, stress, competitive aggression) are the foundation
for social interactions and are highly relevant for understanding
psychiatric disorders (7–9). Emerging genetic and environmental
evidence suggests that traits such as dominance, competitive ag-
gression, and active coping strategies are linked, resulting in phe-
notypes more resistant to psychiatric disorders (10–12). In contrast,
subordinate status and the absence of aggression are linked to
phenotypes more susceptible to adverse psychiatric outcomes
(e.g., PTSD). Despite the importance of understanding the basic
mechanisms underlying aggression and dominance and their role
in psychiatric disorders, possible sex differences in the basic
neural mechanisms underlying these phenomena have received
almost no attention.
Given that social behavior is evolutionarily ancient and social
strategies used by females and males evolved in response to very
different selective pressures, it seems likely that there are fun-
damental sex differences in the neural mechanisms regulating
expression of social behaviors such as dominance and competi-
tive aggression. And yet little is known about the neurobiology of
dominance and competitive aggression, particularly in females.
Studies of aggression in female rodents have focused almost ex-
clusively on maternal aggression at least in part because female
laboratory rodents rarely display spontaneous aggression. In con-
trast, Syrian hamsters provide an outstanding rodent model with
which to investigate competitive strategies in females as well as
males because aggression does not have to be induced as in many
other social species (e.g., mice and rats) by artificial means (e.g.,
electric shock) or by mating-induced pair bonding (e.g., voles)
(13–15). Female hamsters, like female monkeys, display a range of
competitive strategies including the rapid formation of robust hi-
erarchal dominance relationships and the ability to inhibit the
reproductive capacity of other females (9, 16). Both female and
male hamsters also readily display a variety of social behaviors that
are fundamental for social relationships. In addition, a great deal
is known about the biological mechanisms controlling social be-
havior in Syrian hamsters, making it a powerful model system for
Significance
There are profound sex differences in the expression of social
behavior and in the incidence of many psychiatric disorders,
and yet little is known about how the brain mechanisms un-
derlying these phenomena differ in females and males. Here,
we report that serotonin (5-HT) and arginine–vasopressin (AVP)
act in opposite ways within the hypothalamus to regulate
dominance and aggression in females and males. Dominance
and aggression are promoted by 5-HT in females and by AVP
in males. Because dominance and aggressiveness have been
linked to the resistance to stress-related psychiatric disorders,
these disorders may be more effectively treated with 5-HT–
targeted drugs in females and AVP-targeted drugs in males.

 preclinical study of behaviors that underlie psychiatric health and
illness (9, 17).
One of the most well-known phenomena in behavioral neu-
roscience is the ability of serotonin (5-HT) to inhibit impulsive
behaviors, including aggression, in males in species ranging from
invertebrates to primates (18–20). In contrast to 5-HT, centrally
administered arginine–vasopressin (AVP) stimulates aggression
in males, and antagonists of AVP V1a receptors (V1aRs) reduce
aggression (13, 14, 21). In support of the hypothesis that there
are fundamental sex differences in the neural mechanisms regu-
lating social behavior, we recently found that AVP has the op-
posite effect on competitive aggression in female hamsters (22). In
contrast to males, central administration of AVP in females re-
duces aggression, and V1aR antagonists stimulate aggression. Re-
markably, despite hundreds of studies demonstrating that 5-HT
inhibits aggression in males, the effects of 5-HT on aggression in
females remain essentially unknown (23, 24).
In the following experiments, we investigated the hypothesis
that there are fundamental sex differences in the neural regu-
lation of aggression and dominance. More specifically, we in-
vestigated whether 5-HT promotes and AVP inhibits aggression
and dominance in females and whether 5-HT inhibits and AVP
promotes aggression and dominance in males. These studies
support this hypothesis by directly comparing sex-specific effects
of 5-HT and AVP on aggression and by demonstrating that ac-
quisition of dominance is associated with activation of raphe
5-HT neurons in females and hypothalamic AVP neurons in
males. Together, these data provide strong support for the hy-
pothesis that there are striking sex differences in the mechanisms
regulating social behavior. Given the emerging relationship of
aggression and dominance with phenotypes that are resilient to
psychiatric disorders, understanding how the 5-HT and AVP
systems control aggression and dominance has the potential for
significant translational impact. For example, the following ex-
periments demonstrate that systemic administration of one of
the most commonly prescribed selective 5-HT reuptake inhibi-
tors (SSRIs) (i.e., fluoxetine) has opposite effects in females and
males, suggesting that clinical efficacy of SSRIs may differ dra-
matically between the sexes.
Despite widespread use of SSRIs, there appear to be no
studies examining gender differences in the efficacy of SSRIs to
treat stress disorders and only a limited number examining SSRI
efficacy to treat depression. Of the published peer-reviewed
studies, five found no difference in the efficacy of SSRIs in men
and women (25–29), and six found SSRIs to be more effective in
women (30–35). There are no reports of SSRIs being more ef-
fective in men. Thus, these data do not generate confidence that
there is comparable clinical efficacy of SSRIs in men and women
but rather suggest that SSRIs are more effective as an antide-
pressant in women than in men. The lack of definitive data is
remarkable but not surprising. It is not uncommon that large sex
differences in the efficacy of therapies used by millions are
overlooked in clinical practice (36, 37).
Results
Activation of 5-HT1aRs in the AH Stimulates Aggression in Females. In
view of the substantial evidence that activation of 5-HT1a re-
ceptors (5-HT1aRs) inhibits aggression in males, we examined
the effects of the 5-HT1aR agonist 7-(Dipropylamino)-5,6,7,8-
tetrahydronaphthalen-1-ol (8-OH-DPAT) in females (24). Mi-
croinjection of 8-OH-DPAT into the anterior hypothalamus
(AH) (Fig. S1; see ref. 38) produced a dose-dependent increase
in aggression, F(3, 27) = 4.36, P < 0.05 (Fig. 1A), and a decrease
in latency to attack, F(3, 26) = 3.27, P < 0.01 (Fig. S2A). Five
hundred micromolar and 1 mM 8-OH-DPAT increased the du-
ration of aggression (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 1A)
and decreased the latency to attack (P < 0.05; Fig. S2A) compared
with controls. Because of the surprising finding that 8-OH-DPAT
stimulated aggression in females, we directly compared the effects
of 8-OH-DPAT in females and males. There was a significant
interaction between sex and drug treatment on the duration of
aggression, F(1, 27) = 37.50, P < 0.01 (Fig. 1B). 8-OH-DPAT
treatment increased the duration of aggression in females, t(15) =
3.46, P < 0.01, and decreased the duration of aggression in males,
t(13) = 6.82, P < 0.01. There was a significant interaction between
drug treatment and sex on latency to attack, F(1, 28) = 16.24, P <
0.01 (Fig. S2B). Although 8-OH-DPAT treatment did not affect
latency to attack in females, t(15) = 1.55, P > 0.05, it increased
latency to attack in males, t(13) = 3.99, P < 0.01.
8-OH-DPAT and AVP Alter the Expression of Aggression in Males and
Females in Opposite Ways. Next, we directly compared the effects
of 8-OH-DPAT, AVP, and 8-OH-DPAT combined with AVP
(8-OH-DPAT/AVP) on aggression following injection into the
AH of females and males. There was a significant interaction
between sex and drug treatment on the duration of aggression,
F(3,48) = 34.14, P < 0.01 (Fig. 2). 8-OH-DPAT–treated females
were more aggressive than control females (P < 0.01), whereas
AVP-treated females were less aggressive than control females
(P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). 8-OH-DPAT/AVP–treated females were
more aggressive than AVP-treated females (P < 0.05) and less
aggressive than 8-OH-DPAT–treated females (P < 0.05) but did
not differ from control females (P > 0.05; Fig. 2A). 8-OH-DPAT–
treated males were less aggressive than control males (P < 0.01),
whereas AVP-treated males were more aggressive than control
males (P < 0.05; Fig. 2A). 8-OH-DPAT/AVP–treated males were
less aggressive than AVP-treated males (P < 0.01) and control
males (P < 0.01), whereas 8-OH-DPAT/AVP–treated males were
more aggressive than 8-OH-DPAT–treated males (P < 0.05;
Fig. 2A). Direct comparisons between females and males
revealed that 8-OH-DPAT–treated females were more aggres-
sive than 8-OH-DPAT–treated males, t(13) = 10.14, P < 0.01
(Fig. 2B). 8-OH-DPAT/AVP–treated females were more aggres-
sive than 8-OH-DPAT/AVP–treated males, t(8) = 3.58, P < 0.01
(Fig. 2B). AVP-treated females were less aggressive than AVP-
treated males, t(12) = 7.03, P < 0.01 (Fig. 2B). There was a sig-
nificant interaction between sex and drug treatment for attack
latency, F(3, 49) = 12.58, P < 0.01 (Fig. S3). AVP-treated females
had a longer latency to attack than 8-OH-DPAT–treated females
(P < 0.05) and a strong trend compared with 8-OH-DPAT/AVP–
treated females (P = 0.06; Fig. S3A). 8-OH-DPAT–treated males
had a longer latency to attack than all other male groups (P <
0.01; Fig. S3A). Direct comparisons between females and males
revealed that AVP-treated females had a longer latency to attack
than AVP-treated males, t(12) = 3.84, P < 0.01 (Fig. S3B).
8-OH-DPAT–treated females had a shorter latency to attack than
8-OH-DPAT–treated males, t(13) = 5.84, P < 0.01 (Fig. S3B).

 Systemically Administered Fluoxetine Alters Aggression in Opposite
Ways in Males and Females. We tested the hypothesis that sys-
temically administered fluoxetine increases aggression in fe-
males. There was a dose-dependent increase in duration of
aggression, F(2, 34) = 3.70, P < 0.05 (Fig. 3A). Treatment with
20 mg/kg fluoxetine increased aggression compared with vehicle
(P < 0.05). There was also a dose-dependent decrease in the
latency to attack, F(2, 34) = 3.65, P < 0.05 (Fig. S4A). Treatment
with 20 mg/kg fluoxetine significantly decreased attack latency
compared with vehicle (P < 0.05). We directly compared the
effect of fluoxetine on aggression in females and males. There
was an interaction between fluoxetine treatment and sex on the
duration of aggression, F(1, 37) = 47.62, P < 0.01 (Fig. 3B). A
dose of 20 mg/kg fluoxetine increased the duration of aggression
in females, t(29) = 2.57, P < 0.05, and decreased the duration of
aggression in males, t(8) = 5.66, P < 0.01. There was an in-
teraction between fluoxetine treatment and sex on latency to
attack, F(1, 37) = 35.77, P < 0.01 (Fig. S4B). A dose of 20 mg/kg
fluoxetine decreased latency to attack in females, t(29) = 2.63,
P < 0.05, and increased latency to attack in males, t(8) = 4.160,
P < 0.01.
Dominance and the Activation of 5-HT Neurons. We hypothesized
that activity of 5-HT cells in the raphe, as measured by coloc-
alization of 5-HT-immunoreactivity (ir) and fos-ir, is up-regu-
lated by acquisition of dominance in female hamsters. In the
anterior dorsal raphe nucleus (DRNa) (Fig. 4 A and B), there
was a significant effect of dominance status, F(2, 54) = 3.081, P =
0.05, but not sex, F(1, 54) = 0.686, P > 0.05, nor an interaction,
F(2, 52) = 1.311, P > 0.05, in 5-HT-ir/fos-ir. In the posterior
DRN (DRNp) (Fig. 4 C and D), there was a significant effect of
dominance status, F(2, 50) = 3.084, P = 0.05, and a trend toward
an effect of sex, F(1, 50) = 3.165, P = 0.08, but no interaction,
F(2, 50) = 0.383, P > 0.05, in 5-HT-ir/fos-ir. Within-sex a priori
comparisons revealed that dominant females had more 5-HT-ir/
fos-ir in the DRNa and DRNp than subordinate females (P < 0.05;
Fig. 4 B and D). Dominant females had more 5-HT-ir/fos-ir in the
DRNa and a trend toward more 5-HT-ir/fos-ir in the DRNp than
control females (P < 0.05 and P = 0.08, respectively; Fig. 4 B and
D). There was no effect of dominance status on 5-HT-ir/fos-ir in the
DRNa and DRNp of males (P > 0.05; Fig. 4 B and D). In the
median raphe nucleus (MRN) (Fig. 4 E and F), there was no ef-
fect of dominance status, F(2, 48) = 1.736, P > 0.05, but a strong
trend toward an effect of sex, F(1, 48) = 3.758, P = 0.06, and no
interaction, F(2, 48) = 1.648, P > 0.05, in 5-HT-ir/fos-ir. Within-
sex a priori comparisons revealed no differences in 5-HT-ir/fos-ir
for either females or males (P > 0.05; Fig. 4F).
We also examined whether dominance status altered 5-HT-ir/
fos-ir in the ventral (vrDRNa) and dorsal (drDRNa) subdivisions
of the most rostral portion of the DRNa in female and male
hamsters because a previous study in male hamsters found sub-
ordinates have significantly more 5-HT-ir/fos-ir in the vrDRNa
than dominant and control hamsters (17). In the vrDRNa (Fig. 4
G and H), there was an effect of dominance status on 5-HT-ir/
fos-ir in males, F(2, 23) = 3.902, P < 0.05, with subordinate males
having more 5-HT-ir/fos-ir compared with dominants and con-
trols (P < 0.05; Fig. 4H). In females, there no effect of domi-
nance status on 5-HT-ir/fos-ir in the vrDRNa, F(2, 26) = 0.723,
P > 0.05, nor were there differences between dominant, sub-
ordinate, and control females (P > 0.05; Fig. 4H). In the drDRNa
(Fig. 4 I and J), there was an effect of dominance status on 5-HT-
ir/fos-ir in males, F(2, 23) = 6.355, P < 0.01, with dominant males
having more 5-HT-ir/fos-ir than controls or subordinates (P < 0.05
and P < 0.01, respectively; Fig. 4J). In females, there was an effect
of dominance status on the number of 5-HT-ir/fos-ir cells in the
drDRNa, F(2, 26) = 6.431, P < 0.01. Dominant females had more
5-HT-ir/fos-ir than controls and subordinates (P < 0.01 and P <
0.05, respectively; Fig. 4J).
Dominance and the Activation of AVP Neurons. In males, we hy-
pothesized that the activity of AVP-containing cells, as measured
by the colocalization of AVP-ir/fos-ir, is up-regulated in hypo-
thalamic nuclei by the acquisition of dominance. In the medial
supraoptic nucleus (mSON) (Fig. 5 A and B), there was an effect
of dominance status on AVP-ir/fos-ir, F(1, 55) = 31.51, P < 0.01,
but no effect of sex, F(1, 55) = 0.32, P > 0.05, and no interaction,
F(2, 55) = 1.37, P > 0.05. Within-sex a priori comparisons
revealed subordinate males had more AVP-ir/fos-ir than control
males (P < 0.01) and dominant males had more AVP-ir/fos-ir
than subordinate males (P < 0.05) and control males (P < 0.01;
Fig. 5B). In females, both subordinate and dominant animals had
more AVP-ir/fos-ir than control females (P < 0.01), but there was
no difference between dominants and subordinates (P > 0.05;
Fig. 5B). In the nucleus circularis (NC) (Fig. 5 C and D), there
was no effect of sex, F(1, 46) = 1.69, P > 0.05, but a main effect
of dominance status, F(1, 46) = 15.75, P < 0.01, and a trend
toward an interaction, F(2, 46) = 2.81, P = 0.07. Within-sex a
priori comparisons revealed that dominant and subordinate fe-
males had more AVP-ir/fos-ir than control females (P < 0.01;
Fig. 5D). Dominant males had more AVP-ir/fos-ir than control
males (P < 0.01) and subordinate males (P < 0.01; Fig. 5D). In
the medial paraventricular nucleus (PVN) (Fig. 5 E and F), there

males revealed no effect of dominance status on AVP-ir/fos-ir

than controls.
Discussion
These data support the hypothesis that there are fundamental sex
differences in the neural regulation of aggression and dominance.
Direct comparisons of 5-HT and AVP indicate that these neuro-
chemical signals act in opposite ways within the same brain site to
regulate aggression and dominance in females and males. Hypo-
thalamic injection of a 5-HT-1a agonist stimulated aggression in
females and inhibited aggression in males, whereas injection of
AVP inhibited aggression in females and stimulated aggression in
males. These data also provide evidence that there are striking
differences in the neural mechanisms regulating the acquisition of
dominance in females and males. Acquisition of dominance was
associated with activation of 5-HT cell bodies within the DRN of
females and activation of hypothalamic AVP neurons in males.

 Finally, systemic administration of fluoxetine increased aggression
in females and substantially decreased aggression in males, sug-
gesting that sex differences may be a critical factor in the clinical
efficacy of 5-HT–active drugs.
The present data reinforce previous work indicating that the
AH is a critical element within the neural circuitry controlling
agonistic behavior (15, 39–41). Not only do 5-HT and AVP fibers
project to this region (39, 42), the present data demonstrate that
activation of 5-HT and AVP cell bodies are associated with
acquisition of dominance in a sex-dependent manner. Domi-
nant females displayed significantly more activation of 5-HT cell
bodies within the DRN than subordinate or control females. In
contrast, there were no significant differences in the number of
5-HT–activated cell bodies in the DRN among dominant, sub-
ordinate, or control males. Despite these dramatic sex differ-
ences, more subtle effects of dominance status were observed in
subregions of the DRNa in both females and males. Interest-
ingly, subordinate males, but not females, displayed significantly
more activation of 5-HT cell bodies in the vrDRNa than domi-
nant or control males, as has been reported previously, and
dominance status altered the activation of 5-HT cell bodies in
the drDRNa in both females and males (17). Therefore, al-
though activation of 5-HT cell bodies throughout the DRN is
associated with the acquisition of dominance in females and not
males, more subtle changes within DRNa subregions can be
related to dominance status in males as well as females.
In males, acquisition of dominance was strongly associated
with activation of AVP cell bodies in the mSON and NC. Domi-
nant males displayed significantly more activation of AVP cell
bodies within both the mSON and NC than did subordinate or
control males. In contrast, in females, a significantly larger number
of AVP cell bodies were activated in the mSON and NC in both
dominant and subordinate females than in controls. Thus, there is
a substantial sex difference in the relationship between dominance
and activation of AVP cell bodies in the mSON and NC. In males,
activation of AVP cell bodies in these sites was associated with
dominance, whereas in females activation of these neurons was
independent of dominance status but was associated with social
interaction. Interestingly, in the PVN, activation of AVP cell
bodies in males was associated with social interaction, whereas
no such relationship was observed in females.
Studies of the neural mechanisms underlying competitive ag-
gression have been conducted almost exclusively in males, probably
because of the longstanding emphasis on male–male competition in
intrasexual selection (43). The present findings are consistent with
the large body of previous work on the roles of 5-HT and AVP in
regulating competitive aggression in males. In contrast, studies of
the neural mechanisms underlying aggression in females have
focused almost exclusively on maternal aggression (44). Although
the importance of female competitive behaviors in achieving re-
productive benefits has long been recognized, particularly in pri-
mates, little attention has been paid to their underlying neural
mechanisms (16, 45). The present data demonstrate that although
the behavioral expression of aggression and dominance in females
and males is quite similar, 5-HT and AVP act in opposite ways
within the same brain site to regulate these behaviors.
The strong but opposite relationship between activation of
the 5-HT and AVP systems and the promotion of aggression/
dominance in females and males may have significant clinical
importance. For example, because dominance imparts a resistance
to the adverse consequences of social stress, the findings of major
sex differences in the neurochemical regulation of aggression/
dominance may be important for our understanding of sex dif-
ferences in the incidence and treatment of stress-related psychi-
atric disorders (12, 46). Indeed, it is possible that 5-HT–active
drugs are more efficacious in treating some psychiatric disorders in
females and AVP-active drugs are more efficacious in males. One
of the most commonly prescribed 5-HT–active drugs for treatment
of psychiatric disorders is fluoxetine (Prozac), and the possibility
that there are sex differences in its efficacy is reinforced by our
findings that the systemic administration of fluoxetine increases
aggression in females and reduces it in males. In support of this
possibility, systemic administration of fluoxetine to rats reduced
negative effects of stress on learning in females but not males (47).
Further support comes from the finding that the severity of PTSD
symptoms was negatively correlated with urinary levels of AVP in
men but not women (48). Furthermore, intranasal AVP improved
PTSD symptoms in men but not women (48). Determination of
possible sex differences in the efficacy of 5-HT– and AVP-active
drugs to treat stress-related psychiatric disorders would have an
almost immediate clinical impact by guiding drug treatment and
development, emphasizing the role of 5-HT–targeted drugs in
females and AVP-targeted drugs in males.
Materials and Methods
Animals and Drug Treatment. Adult male and female Syrian hamsters (Charles
River Laboratories Inc. and in-house bred), 8–12 wk old, weighing between
110 and 140 g, were used for all experiments. Hamsters were individually
housed in polycarbonate cages (24 × 43 × 20 cm). All hamsters were kept in a
14:10 light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. Nonaggressive
intruder (NAI) hamsters were group-housed. All experiments were con-
ducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guidelines for
the Use of Animals and were approved by the Georgia State University In-
stitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (49). The following drugs were
used in the microinjection experiments: 8-OH-DPAT (78950–78-4; Sigma-
Aldrich) and AVP (065–07; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals). Doses of 1 mM and
100 μM of 8-OH-DPAT were used in females and males, respectively. AVP was
used at a dose of 0.9 μM in both sexes. The 8-OH-DPAT/AVP mixture was
used at 1 mM/0.9 μM doses, respectively, in both sexes. Concentrations were
informed by previous studies (13, 22, 50). Drugs were dissolved in sterile
physiological saline. Controls were microinjected with 200 nL of saline. Flu-
oxetine hydrochloride (CAS no. 56296–78-7; Cayman Chemica) dissolved in
diH2O was injected intraperitoneally (IP) to females in the following doses:
0 mg/kg (vehicle), 8 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg. Males received vehicle or 20 mg/kg.
Injection Experiments. Before surgery, hamsters were housed singly for at least
1 wk. Hamsters were deeply anesthetized with a gaseous solution of 5%
(vol/vol) isoflurane mixed with oxygen in an induction chamber and main-
tained under gaseous anesthesia between 3.00% and 4.00% (vol/vol) iso-
flurane mixed with oxygen. Hamsters were implanted unilaterally with a 4-mm,
26-gauge guide cannula aimed at the AH using a stereotaxic apparatus. Coordi-
nates were +0.8 mm anterior to bregma, ±1.5 mm from the midline, and –3.5 mm
from the top of the skull at an 8° angle (see ref. 38). Hamsters recovered at least
3 d before handling. The next week, hamsters were handled daily, and estrous
cycles were monitored in females. The next week, hamsters were tested for ag-
gression. Five minutes before testing, hamsters were microinjected with 200 nL of
drug or saline. Injections lasted 30 s, and the needle remained in the guide can-
nula for an additional 30 s. Hamsters were tested in a neutral arena for 5 min with
a smaller NAI of the same sex. Experimental females were tested during diestrus
to ensure aggression during testing and NAI females during proestrus to ensure
no aggression during testing. After testing, hamsters were euthanized with an
overdose of sodium pentobarbital and injected with ink to verify cannula site
placement. In the fluoxetine studies, hamsters were housed, handled, and tested
as described earlier. Two hours before behavior testing, hamsters were injected IP
with fluoxetine or vehicle.
Immunofluorescence. Hamsters were isolated, handled, and tested in the same
way as in the injection experiments. Hamsters were paired with a weight and
sex-matched opponent in a resident–intruder paradigm for 15 min, and be-
havior was analyzed to determine dominance as described in a previous
report (46). Controls were moved to an empty, dirty cage belonging to a
same-sex hamster. One hour after the start of testing, hamsters were eu-
thanized as described earlier, transcardially perfused, and tissue processed as
previously described (51). Brains were cut in 40-μm coronal sections on a
cryostat and stored in a cryoprotectant solution (500 mL PBS, 300 g sucrose,
10 g polyvinyl pyrrolidone, 300 mL ethylene glycol) until immunofluorescent
processing. Raphe sections were processed using antibodies for 5-HT (20079;
Immunostar) and c-Fos (sc-52; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), a marker of neural
activation. Hypothalamic sections were processed using antibodies for AVP
(T-5048; Peninsula Laboratories) and c-Fos. All immunofluorescent procedures
were conducted at room temperature. Sections were washed in PBS four times
for 5 min and blocked in 10% normal donkey serum (NDS) with 0.4% of Triton
X-100 in PBS for 1 h. Raphe sections were incubated overnight in an antibody
solution (ABS; 0.4% of Triton X-100 and 2% NDS in PBS) for 5-HT (1/1,000) and
c-Fos (1/1,000). Hypothalamic sections were incubated overnight in ABS for

 AVP (1/2,500) and c-Fos (1/1,000). Sections were washed in ABS five times for
5 min and incubated in darkness for 2 h in ABS containing secondary anti-
bodies Alexa Fluor 488 and 594 (1/500; Jackson Immunoreserach). All tissue
was washed in PBS in darkness four times for 5 min. Tissue was mounted onto
Colorfrost Plus Microscope Slides (12-550-17; Fisher Scientific) in PBS, rinsed
with diH2O, and coverslipped with Vectashield Hard Set Mounting Medium
for Fluorescence (H1400; Vector Laboratories).
Confocal Microscopy and Quantification. Digital images were acquired with a
Zeiss LSM 720 confocal microscope at 8–20× magnification, depending on
region size. Using Zeiss ZEN 2012 software, 2-μm interval Z stack images
were obtained, and representative images of entire regions from each
subject were quantified. Overall adjustments to brightness were applied
evenly to channels of all images to maximize clarity. The “Cell Counting”
plugin in ImageJ was used for quantification. Cell activation was determined
by quantifying cells containing staining for 5-HT or AVP and c-Fos. Digital
zooming was used to confirm colocalization. Raphe areas quantified include
the DRNa, DRNp, MRN, vrDRNa, and drDRNa. Hypothalamic areas quantified
include mSON, NC, and medial PVN. Images in Figs. 4 and 5 are maximum
intensity projection images.
Data Analysis. SPSS v22 was used to analyze all data. Two-way independent
analysis of variance (ANOVA), single-variable ANOVA, and independent t tests
were all used where appropriate. When appropriate, data were transformed
using the square root before commencing with analysis. Graphs are of original
data and not transformed data. All post hoc comparisons were a priori. Tests
were two tailed, and differences were determined to be significant at P < 0.05.
