Over the past decade, abnormalities have been documented in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus 
virginianus) in west-central Montana. Hypotheses proposed to explain these anomalies included contact 
with endocrine disrupting pesticides, such as imidacloprid. We evaluated the effects of imidacloprid 
experimentally at the South Dakota State University Wildlife and Fisheries Captive Facility where adult 
white-tailed deer females and their fawns were administered aqueous imidacloprid (an untreated 
control, 1,500 ng/L, 3,000 ng/L, and 15,000 ng/L). Water consumption, thyroid hormone function, 
behavioral responses, and skull and jawbone measurements were compared among treatments. 
Additionally, liver, spleen, genital, and brain imidacloprid concentrations were determined by an 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results indicated that 1) control deer consumed more 
water than treatment groups, 2) imidacloprid was present in the organs of our control group, indicating 
environmental contamination, 3) as imidacloprid increased in the spleen, fawn survival, thyroxine 
levels, jawbone lengths, body weight, and organ weights decreased, 4) adult female imidacloprid levels 
in the genitals were negatively correlated with genital organ weight and, 5) behavioral observations 
indicated that imidacloprid levels in spleens were negatively correlated with activity levels in adult 
females and fawns. Results demonstrate that imidacloprid has direct effects on white-tailed deer when 
administered at field–relevant doses.
Neonicotinoids are a broad-spectrum insecticide predominantly used as seed dressings on major field crops 
and are additionally used as sprays in crop production, in managing household pests, and in deterring pests on 
domesticated animals1. Neonicotinoids derive their toxicity from agonistically binding to nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors (nAChRs) on the post-synaptic nerve membrane and firing nerve impulses in a manner that is uncon-
trollable and uninterrupted1–7. Neonicotinoids were first developed in the 1990s8, gained popularity from 2003-
20119, and are now the most widely used pesticides in the world10.
Popularity of neonicotinoids is due to their advertised high toxicity to insects and low toxicity to vertebrates1. 
Additionally, neonicotinoids have gained popularity by their ability to systemically protect plants while reducing 
application inputs for farmers10. In 2014, over 3.3 million kg of neonicotinoids (including acetamiprid, clothiani-
din, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) were used in the United States (excluding Hawaii 
and Alaska) on pasture hay, alfalfa, orchards, grapes, rice, vegetables, fruit, cotton, wheat, soybeans, corn, and 
other crops11. In South Dakota, more than 94% of U.S. corn and at least 50% of U.S. soybeans12 are treated with 
one of the three neonicotinoids: clothianidin, imidacloprid, or thiamethoxam13–15.
Neonicotinoids are widely found in the environment for numerous reasons. First, only a small quantity 
(2–20%) of the seed-coated insecticide is absorbed by the developing plant; the remainder is released into the 
environment through leaching, drainage, run-off, or snowmelt16,17. Neonicotinoids are highly water soluble18;

they are prevalent in diverse water bodies in the United States, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Asia17. Moreover, 
under the right conditions, neonicotinoids can persist in the soil, sometimes for many years1. Finally, untreated 
plants associated with cropland are often contaminated by neonicotinoids due to the systemic nature of these 
chemicals19. The widespread use of neonicotinoids provides numerous opportunities for exposure to non-target, 
beneficial species via the water, soil, and contaminated plant tissues.
In addition to their documented effects on beneficial insects, neonicotinoids adversely affect non-target verte-
brates as well, including rats (Rattus norvegicus: reduced sperm production, reduced offspring weight, increased 
abortions, skeletal abnormalities, thyroid lesions, atrophy of retina, reduced weight gain of offspring, oxidative 
stress, and neurobehavioral deficits), mice (Mus musculus: suppressed cell-mediated immune response and prom-
inent histopathological alterations in spleen and liver), rabbits (Sylvilagus sp: increased frequency of miscar-
riage and premature births), red-legged partridges (Alectoris rufa: reduced adult and chick survival, fertilization 
rate, and immune response), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus: extensive disintegration of testicular tissue and 
changes to gonads), Medaka (Oryzias latipes: juvenile stress led to ectoparasite infestation), and black-spotted 
pond frogs (Rana nigromaculata: DNA damage at very low concentrations)20. To our knowledge, no information 
is available on potential effects on large mammals, such as white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus).
Over the past decade, morphological and developmental abnormalities have been documented in white-tailed 
deer in west-central Montana. Of 254 male deer of various ages, 67% showed genital developmental abnormali-
ties such as mispositioned and undersized scrota and ectopic testes21; these abnormalities were documented for 
accident-killed and injured cervids21. Hoy et al.21 suggested that genital anomalies could be caused by endocrine 
disrupting pesticides but stated that, based on the information available, no cause and effect could be justified. In 
addition, from 2000 to 2009, brachygnathia superior (i.e., mandibular prognathia or underbite) increased from 
0% to 70% for white-tailed deer that were collected from west-central (accident killed) and throughout (hunter 
harvested) Montana22. Underbite is a characteristic of congenital hypothyroidism, which has been documented in 
South Dakota23, and is nearly always associated with fetal thyroid hormone function22, but the cause has not been 
empirically determined for this observation.
We hypothesized that imidacloprid would have sub-lethal and potentially lethal effects on adult female and 
fawn white-tailed deer. We predicted that adult females, especially in the high treatment group, would have 
reduced Free Triiodothyronine (FT3) and Free Thyroxine (FT4) levels, presence of imidacloprid in milk, and 
reduced activity associated with exposure to imidacloprid. We also predicted that fawns exposed to imidacloprid 
at relatively high treatment levels would have abnormal genital organs, lowered FT3 and FT4 levels, reduced 
activity, and a high prevalence of under bite.
Methods
Our research study was conducted at the South Dakota State University Wildlife and Fisheries Captive Research 
Facility in Brookings County, South Dakota (44°20′
N, 96°47′
W). This facility housed white-tailed deer (begin-
ning in about 1998) on 4 ha; the facility is double fenced with 3-m high woven wire. The facility is situated adja-
cent to agricultural fields normally planted to corn or soybeans, and is surrounded by a shelterbelt of trees. Mean 
annual temperatures were 7.4 °C (ranged from −
28.8 °C and 34.4 °C) and 7.8 °C (−
35 °C to 32.8 °C) in 2015 and 
2016, respectively. Additionally, daily annual precipitation was 0.18 cm (0.03 cm to 5.2 cm) and 0.2 cm (from 
0.3 cm to 7 cm) in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Finally, daily annual snowfall was 0.3 cm (0.3–17.8 cm) and 0.3 cm 
(0.3–11.4 cm) in 2015 and 2016, respectively24.
Twenty adult white-tailed deer were randomly selected for the experiment and bred; parturition occurred in 
May and June of each experimental year. Adult females were separated into four treatments (care was taken to 
separate adult females so that age and weight were uniformly distributed): control (n = 4), low (n = 4), moderate 
(n = 5), and high (n = 7) (the moderate and high treatment groups had a larger sample size to reduce the standard 
error for our response variable). Deer were housed in pens of similar size (control = 130 m2/deer, low = 175 m2/
deer, moderate = 123 m2/deer, high = 112 m2/deer in 2015 and 165 m2/deer in 2016). All deer were fed rations that 
included soy hulls, shelled corn, and alfalfa hay ad libitum.
Adult females were administered aqueous imidacloprid (Product # 37984, Sigma Aldrich St. Louis, MO) from 
May until October to mimic free water availability within the Dakotas. We added 0 ng/L, 1,500 ng/L, 3,000 ng/L, 
and 15,000 ng/L of imidacloprid to the control, low, moderate, and high treatments, respectively. The low and 
moderate concentrations were similar to wetland levels found in groundwater in Wisconsin (detected in 24% 
of the groundwater sample and ranged from 260–3,340 ng/L); however, they were greater than levels found in 
rural streams in Iowa (detected in 23% of streams sampled and ranged from <2–42.7 ng/L) or in Canadian 
(Saskatchewan) wetlands (detected in 12% of wetlands and ranged from 7.1–256 ng/L)25. Our high treatment was 
intended to invoke an effect and therefore, was much greater than documented in free water. Deer were provided 
with a 60.6 L tub that contained 37.8 L of water treated with the appropriate amount of imidacloprid depending on 
the group (control, low, moderate, high). Deer consumed the water treated with imidacloprid ad libitum. Water 
levels were checked daily and refilled with the appropriate imidacloprid treated water when empty or less than 
3 cm from the bottom (every 1–2 d) of containers. When refilling occurred, each tub was rinsed thoroughly and 
excess water was poured into 189 L tubs provided by the SDSU Environmental Health and Safety office.
Fawns born to adult females in the study were included in our experiment. On the day of parturition, each 
fawn was handled minimally with gloves to determine body mass and sex; fawns also were fitted with ear tags. To 
mimic natural water availability, fawns were not prevented from consuming the imidacloprid in water. Facilities 
and techniques for research were approved by the South Dakota State University Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee (IACUC number 15–055 A) and followed guidelines by the American Society of Mammologists26.
Solution consumed. 
During experiments, water tubs housing aqueous imidacloprid were weighed daily to 
determine the volume of water consumed per group. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to compare

water consumption among treatment and control groups with date used as a covariate. To detect imidacloprid 
concentrations as the imidacloprid water was consumed, a 3-d experiment was conducted. On day 1, the appro-
priate treatment or control group concentrations were created in five, 63 L galvanized tubs. On day 2, 50% of 
the water was removed from all tubs. On the third day, nearly all water was removed from the tubs, leaving only 
enough water to coat the bottom of tubs. Samples (15 mL) were collected daily from each tub. This procedure 
mimicked water level reductions due to deer consumption. Imidacloprid samples were analyzed using ELISA 
(enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; Abraxis, Warminister, PA; See Section 4.7 for procedures).
Collection of blood samples. 
Blood samples were collected from adult females and fawns in treatments 
using BD Vacutainer Serum tubes (Becton, Dickinson, and Company, Franklin, NJ). We collected up to 12 mL 
of blood from the saphenous vein approximately monthly during treatments while deer were held in a chute 
(Priefert Wildlife Equipment Deer Chute; Priefert®, Mount Pleasant, TX). We collected blood samples (1–10cc 
from the saphenous or jugular) from fawns twice; 1 wk after parturition and at approximately 5 mo of age. Blood 
samples were refrigerated until processed to extract serum (1 h to 2 d). Upon reaching the lab, blood samples were 
centrifuged (Ultra-8V; LW Scientific, Lawrenceville, GA) for 15 min at 280 ×
 g to separate serum for testing FT3 
(free triiodothyronine) and FT4 (free thyroxine) hormones.
FT3 and FT4 thyroid hormones reflect the ability of the deer to utilize body fat reserves, regulate basal meta-
bolic rate, and control thermal regulation27. Serum from blood samples was transferred to labeled 1.5 mL micro-
centrifuge tubes (BrandTech® Scientific Inc., Essex, CT), sealed, and frozen at −
20 °C. These samples were then 
overnighted to the Diagnostic Center for Population and Animal Health at Michigan State University (Lansing, 
MI) for FT3 and FT4 testing. These assays were performed with commercially available solid-phase radioim-
munoassay kits (FREE T3 Solid Phase Component System and Free T4 Solid Phase Component System, MP 
Biomedicals Diagnostics Division Orangeburg NY 10962). The volumes of sample, assay standards, and radioli-
gand were used according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Incubation times for free T3 and free T4 assays were 
2.5 h and 1.5 h, respectively, at 37 °C.
Behavioral Observations. 
Focal sampling of behavioral observations were collected on treatment and 
control groups prior to death. Behaviors included eat, lay, lay/groom, lay/ruminate, stand/ruminate, run, 
stand, stand/groom, stand/nurse, and walk; for fawns, the behaviors lay/curl and lay/sleep also were recorded. 
Observations were conducted in 1 h blocks using an ethogram28. During time blocks, occurrences of behaviors 
were tallied and the duration of each behavior (in s) was recorded. Observations occurred between 6:00 and 
16:00. In each session, an adult female or fawn was randomly chosen (without replacement) from each treatment 
and control group (n = 28 h for 2016 fawns and n = 21 h for adult females).
Necropsies. 
All deer in the experiment (adult females and fawns) were euthanized and subsequently necrop-
sied using IACUC approved protocols. Fawns were euthanized at the end of each field season (October 2015 
and 2016) and adult females were euthanized at the completion of the study (October 2016). Adult females and 
fawns were first tranquilized using xylazine (Bayer, Englewood, Colorado) and telezol (Zoetis, Parsippany-Troy 
Hills, New Jersey) when held in a Priefert deer chute and, once immobilized, were euthanized using euthanasia 
solution (MWI Veterinary Supply, Boise, ID) according to manufacturer’s suggested dosage. Once does and fawns 
were euthanized, they were frozen at −
20 °C. All fawns and does in the experiment were necropsied at the South 
Dakota Animal Disease Research and Diagnostic Laboratory, South Dakota State University, Brookings, South 
Dakota.
Necropsies were performed by Dr. David Knudsen (assisted by E. Hughes Berheim). Liver, brain, spleen, and 
genital organs were extracted, weighed, and 2.54 cm3 samples were collected. Additionally, we collected fawn jaw-
bones to determine length. Organ samples were then frozen at −
20 °C until they could be analyzed using ELISA.
ELISA Testing. 
Imidacloprid levels were determined for each organ collected. Brain, liver, spleen, and genital 
samples were removed from the freezer, and a portion of each organ (0.5–0.75 g) was minced using a sterilized 
scalpel and placed into a polypropylene micro centrifuge tube. Water was added to the tube at a ratio of 1 mL:1 g 
tissue sample. Each mixture was shaken using a vortex (Thermo Scientific), heated in an 80 °C water bath for 
10 min, and frozen at −
20 °C. Frozen mixtures were thawed and centrifuged (Centrifuge 5424, Eppendorf) at 
21,130 g for 1 min. The liquid was extracted and placed into separate micro centrifuge tubes; remaining solids in 
the organ samples and remaining liquid were refrozen. Liquid samples were vortexed and a 25 μ
L portion was 
extracted and placed into a separate microcentrifuge tube. The excess liquid also was stored frozen. The remaining 
liquid was mixed with 25 μ
L of water, vortexed for 5 s, and centrifuged for 2 s in preparation for the ELISA assay.
All samples were read at 450 nm using a microplate reader (uQuant, Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Each 
plate had at least two standard curves of purified imidacloprid (Product number: 37894 SIGMA-ALDRICH, St. 
Louis, MO, USA). In preparation for the standard curve on each plate, samples from negative adult females were 
mixed together to account for the matrix effect of the organs and a stock solution of imidacloprid was created at 
0.0, 0.03, 0.06, 0.13, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 ppb. The standard curve on the ELISA plate contained 25 µL control 
organ in solution with 25 µL of the stock solution of imidacloprid, creating eight wells with concentrations that 
comprised one standard curve. We were unable to use the control organs in our standard curve because our 
experiment was unintentionally contaminated with imidacloprid; therefore, we used the deer sample with the 
lowest absorbance value as our baseline for quantifying imidacloprid quantities. We optimized the tissue prepa-
ration approach for this ELISA on solid samples using peer-reviewed methods29–34.
Analysis. 
Data collected in experiments were analyzed using Systat 13 (Systat Software Inc., San Jose, CA). 
Male and female fawn organ concentrations for those fawns that survived versus those that died were compared 
using t-tests. Our ELISA results indicated that there was contamination of our control group. As a consequence,

in addition to ANOVA, ordinary least square (OLS) linear regression was used to assess relationships between 
imidacloprid concentrations in all organ samples and the response variables birth weight, fawn age, FT3, FT4, 
jawbone length, and organ weights; alpha was set at 0.05.
Data collected on behavioral observations for adult females and fawns were analyzed separately but com-
bined over observation period (morning and afternoon). Furthermore, we separated deer into three groups (high, 
moderate, and low) based on organ imidacloprid concentrations. Finally, we used Chi-square tests to determine 
significant differences among behaviors observed in high, moderate, and low imidacloprid groups for adults and 
fawns. If Chi-square tests were significant, we used confidence intervals (90%) to assess which behaviors differed 
among groups (high, moderate, and low).
Results
Doe and Fawn Survival. 
A total of 24 and 39 fawns was born in 2015 and 2016, respectively. In 2015, 12 of 
the fawns were born in August and September due to late breeding. Number of single, twin, triplet, and quadru-
plet litter sizes, respectively, per treatment were 1, 4, 1, 1 (control), 5, 3, 0, 0 (low), 2, 3, 2, 0 (moderate), and 2, 7, 2, 
0 (high); 3 fawns were found outside treatment pens and were not included in analyses. Sex ratio (females:males) 
of fawns was 0.46:0.54 and did not differ by treatment (X2
3 = 2.98, p = 0.394). In 2016, a control female died and 
was replaced with another adult female, totaling 21 adult females in our experiment. Fawn and adult female sur-
vival decreased over the two field seasons: survival of fawns was 75% and 62% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Of 
20 adult females in 2015, 0% died (100% survival); in 2016, 19% of 21 adult females died (n = 4, 81% survival). 
Survival of fawns did not differ (p > 0.05) between 2015 and 2016. Additionally, sample size for adult females was 
too small to evaluate change in survival between the two field seasons.
Imidacloprid Solution Consumption. 
Water consumption rates in 2015 and 2016 were monitored, and 
daily consumption was recorded. There were significant interactions in water consumption between treatment 
and date in 2015 (F15, 436 = 2.22, p = 0.01) and 2016 (F15, 555 = 2.19, p = 0.01). In 2015, when the control was 
removed from the analysis, date was still significant (F5, 327 = 21.48, p = 0.01) relative to consumption; however, 
water consumption per adult female was similar across treatments (F2, 327 = 0.60, p = 0.55), indicating the control 
group consumed significantly more water than the treatment groups. In 2016, when excluding the control group, 
the high treatment group consumed less water per adult female than the low and moderate groups (F2, 421 = 12.83, 
p = 0.01), even though consumption of water increased throughout the field season (F5, 421 = 14.25, p = 0.01) 
(Table 1).
Necropsy Data. 
Organ weights were collected from adult females and fawns, and jawbone measurements 
were collected solely from fawns. Adult females had mean organ weights of 159 ± 8 g for brain, 809 ± 104 g for 
liver, 388 ± 41 g for spleen, and 87 ± 28 g for genitals. Mean organ weights of fawns were 106 ± 3.9 g for brain, 
413 ± 37 g for liver, 102 ± 11.4 g for spleen, and 6 ± 0.9 g for genitals. Female fawn mean organ weights were 
96 ± 6 g for brain, 342 ± 55 g for liver, 95 ± 18 g for spleen, and 3 ± 0.6 g for genitals. Male fawn mean organ 
weights were 115 ± 5 g for brain, 479 ± 48 g for liver, 109 ± 14 g for spleen, and 9 ± 1 g for genitals (Table 2). 
Average jawbone length results were 13.8 ± 0.4 cm.
ELISA Results. 
ELISA results indicated imidacloprid was found in the control group organs (Table 3), indi-
cating that our treatments were contaminated; there were no significant differences across treatments for liver 
(F3,18 = 0.511, p = 0.14), brain (F3,18 = 0.058, p = 0.388), genital (F3,18 = 0.17, p = 0.286), or spleen (F3,18 = 0.17, 
p = 0.328) in adult females, or liver (F3,34 = 0.04, p = 0.943), brain (F3,35 = 0.018, p = 0.576), genital (F3,34 = 0.05, 
p = 0.707), or spleen (F3,35 = 0.20, p = 0.199) in fawns; gender of fawns was not significant (p > 0.07) in these anal-
yses. However, imidacloprid concentration in spleen samples of adults approached significance (r = 0.36, p = 0.06) 
when regressed versus control and treatment categories. Nevertheless, this changed our focus from separating 
ELISA results by treatments to viewing the results relative to concentration of imidacloprid. Mean imidacloprid 
values in organs for all adult females were 0.42 ± 0.07 ng/g for liver, 0.06 ± 0.05 ng/g for brain, 0.11 ± 0.04 ng/g 
for spleen, and 0.69 ± 0.05 ng/g for genital (Table 3). Mean imidacloprid values in organs for female fawns were

0.42 ± 0.06 ng/g for liver, 0.03 ± 0.02 ng/g for brain, 0.21 ± 0.05 ng/g for spleen, and 0.26 ± 0.04 ng/g for genital 
(Table 3). Mean imidacloprid values in organs for male fawns were 0.55 ± 0.07 ng/g for liver, 0.05 ± 0.02 ng/g for 
brain, 0.19 ± 0.04 ng/g for spleen, and 0.15 ± 0.03 ng/g for genital (Table 3).
Analyses. 
Spleen concentrations of imidacloprid were significantly higher (T59 = 2.76, p = 0.007) in fawns 
that died compared to the fawns that survived. However, an outlier of 1.49 ng/g of spleen tissue was removed 
from analyses (mean of data with outlier 0.20, range 0–1.49; mean of data without outlier 0.18, range 0–0.91 ng/g 
of tissue); the revised result also was significant (T58 = 4.36, p < 0.001) (Fig. 1). The fawn with this high spleen 
imidacloprid concentration survived, which was not consistent with the overall trend in the data. Mean imida-
cloprid in spleens of fawns that died was 0.33 ± 0.26 ng/g whereas imidacloprid in spleens of fawns that survived 
averaged 0.10 ± 0.14 ng/g. Birth weight was not correlated with imidacloprid levels in any of the organs evaluated 
(Table 4). Fawn body weight at death was negatively correlated with imidacloprid levels in the spleen (F1,55 = 8.22,

levels in the spleen (F1,57 = 10.5, p = 0.002) but not in any of the other organs evaluated (Table 4). Adult female 
FT3 and FT4 values were not correlated with imidacloprid levels in organs (Table 4). Fawn FT3 values were not 
correlated with imidacloprid concentrations in organs; however, FT4 values in fawns were negatively correlated 
(F1,39 = 7.48, p = 0.0092, Table 4) with spleen imidacloprid concentrations. Adult female organ weights were neg-
atively correlated with imidacloprid concentrations in genitals (F1,19 = 5.00, p = 0.04) but not with other organ 
levels evaluated. Fawn organ weights were negatively correlated with spleen (F1,57 = 8.78, p = 0.0044) and genital

(F2,54 = 5.55, p = 0.021) (Table 4) imidacloprid concentrations. Fawn jawbone length was negatively correlated 
with imidacloprid values in the spleen (F1,57 = 9.98, p = 0.002) but not with other organ concentrations (Table 4).
Imidacloprid concentrations in spleen were correlated with fawn survival; therefore, we explored relationships 
between spleen imidacloprid concentrations and deer behavior. Adult female (n = 21) imidacloprid concentra-
tions in spleen were separated into low (n = 12, range = 0), moderate (n = 4, range 0.056–0.224), and high groups 
(n = 5, range = 0.248–0.909); the duration of behaviors were compared among groups (all spleens that had 0 
ppb concentration were placed in the low group). The low imidacloprid group differed (90% CI) from the high 
group in the behaviors eat (groups; high = 2.4%, low = 6%), lay (high = 27%, low = 19%), lay/groom (high = 7%, 
low = 3%), stand/ruminate (high = 1%, low = 2%), run (high = 1%, low = 5%), and stand/groom (high = 8%, 
low = 5%) indicating that adult deer in the low group had higher activity levels than those in the high group. 
The moderate group also differed from the low group in the behaviors eat (group; moderate = 10%, low = 6%), 
lay (moderate = 4%, low = 19%), lay/ruminate (moderate = 2%, low = 5%), stand/ruminate (moderate = 1%, 
low = 2%), run (moderate = 1%, low = 5%), stand (moderate = 34%, low = 23%), stand/groom (moderate = 13%, 
low = 5%), and stand/nurse (moderate = 0%, low = 2%); indicating variation in behavior between the two groups 
(Table 5).
Fawn spleen concentrations of imidacloprid (n = 38) also were placed in low (n = 20, range = 0), moder-
ate (n = 9, range = 0.053–0.121), and high (n = 9, range = 0.148–0.786) groups and the durations of particular 
behaviors were compared among groups. The low group differed (90% CI) from the high group in the behaviors 
lay (group; high = 43%, low = 24%), run (high = 0%, low = 4%), stand (high = 16%, low = 22%), stand/groom 
(high = 2%, low = 6%), and walk (high = 9%, low = 15%); indicating that the high group was less active than the 
low group. The moderate group also differed from the low group in the behaviors eat (group; moderate = 12%, 
low = 8%), lay/curl (moderate = 1%, low = 6%), and lay/groom (moderate = 15%, low = 8%); indicating variation 
in behavior between the two groups (Table 5).

Discussion
Our study provides the first overview of effects of imidacloprid on white-tailed deer. We documented that deer in 
our experiment avoided imidacloprid-contaminated water. Moreover, we discovered that fawns that died during 
our experiment had greater concentrations of imidacloprid in spleens compared to those that survived. Fawns 
with relatively high concentrations of imidacloprid in spleen and genital organs also tended to be smaller and less 
healthy than those with relatively low concentrations of imidacloprid in these organs. Finally, our study provides 
support for reduced activity of adult and fawn white-tailed deer with relatively high concentrations of imidaclo-
prid in spleens.
ELISA results indicated that our control experimental tissues were unintentionally contaminated with imida-
cloprid. Potential sources of contamination included seed-treated food and vegetation. Deer were fed soy hulls 
and a corn, oats, and distiller’s mixture ad libitum. Unfortunately, it was unknown if the soybeans and grains fed 
to our deer were from imidacloprid-treated plants. However, corn and soybeans are commonly (≥
94% of U.S. 
corn, ~50% of U.S. soybeans12) coated with one of the neonicotinoid active ingredients: clothianidin, imidaclo-
prid, or thiamethoxam13. Additionally, deer in our study would often reach through the fence to browse on nat-
ural vegetation. The fields adjacent to the captive wildlife facility were a matrix of agricultural crops with a corn 
field about 50 m north of the facility. It is unknown what pesticides were used on the corn, but it is likely that there 
was a seed treatment of imidacloprid or clothianidin. In Indiana, neonicotinoid dust was documented to disperse 
as far as 100 m from the site35. Imidacloprid from fields could be washed off during rain events and be absorbed 
by other plants, although this transfer is poorly understood19,36. Therefore, uptake of imidacloprid by vegetation 
adjacent to the facility is a likely source of this contamination.
Water containing imidacloprid was avoided by deer in treatments in our experiment as evidenced by variable 
concentrations of the neonicotinoid in captive deer. Deer that avoided consumption of treated water likely drank 
rain water, which was available (up to 0.3 m deep) after storm events during our experiment. Research on cervid 
avoidance of imidacloprid is unavailable, but avoidance of imidacloprid has been recorded in red-legged par-
tridge (Alectoris rufa) when offered treated seeds37. Other animals detect and avoid toxins in their diets; for exam-
ple, kudus (Tragelpahus imberbis), impalas (Aepyceros melampus), and goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) in South 
Africa avoided plants with 5% condensed tannins during the wet season38, likely due to the astringency of these 
compounds.
Significantly higher concentrations of spleen imidacloprid levels were found in fawns that died compared 
to those that survived. The spleen produces white blood cells that fight infection and synthesize antibodies39. 
Imidacloprid can reduce the production of spleen lymphocytes40–42, which results in an impaired immune sys-
tem20. Therefore, immune suppression in our fawns caused by imidacloprid likely was a factor in their deaths. 
Complimentary results were found in the FT4 values that are a pre-cursor to FT3 hormone, which is instrumental 
in regulating basal metabolic rate and thermal regulation in deer27. FT4 was inversely correlated with imidaclo-
prid in spleens of fawns. Reduced metabolic rate in fawns with relatively high concentrations of imidacloprid 
likely explain the lower activity documented in captive deer.
Imidacloprid values in brain were low to undocumented, which was surprising considering that the pesticide 
affects the central nervous system; we hypothesize that this could be due to an inability of the chemical to cross 
the blood-brain barrier. The California Environmental Protection Agency found that imidacloprid penetrates the 
blood-brain barrier. However, Gupta et al.43 found high imidacloprid quantities in rat liver, kidney, lung, and skin, 
but concentrations in the brain were low. Additionally, Krieger44 noted that the blood-brain barrier in vertebrates 
blocks access of imidacloprid to the central nervous system, which reduces toxicity.
Fawns had similar birth weights regardless of the level of imidacloprid in their organs. Similarly, in 
Sprague-Dawley rats, there were no differences in litter size or weight gain in the offspring whether or not 
mothers were given an intraperitoneal injection of imidacloprid45. Additionally, Gawade41 found no significant

Table 5. Behavioral observations closest to individual adult female (AF: n = 21) and fawn (n = 38) deaths (time 
ranged from 1 week to 2 months) were compared to their spleen imidacloprid concentrations. Not all fawns 
had observations collected as: 1) fawn observations were only collected in 2016 and 2) some fawns died prior 
to an observation being completed. Behavioral observations are separated into three groups (low, moderate, 
high) according to spleen organ concentrations (with the high group having the greatest imidacloprid levels 
and the low group having the lowest). Behavioral observations eat, lay, lay/groom (lay/grm), lay/ruminate 
(lay/rum), stand/ruminate (sta/rum), run, stand, stand/groom (sta/grm), stand/nurse (sta/nur), and walk 
(additionally for fawns the behaviors Lay/Curl and Lay/Slp (lay/sleep)) percentages were compared between

difference in weights of imidacloprid exposed Wister rat pups. However, imidacloprid levels in spleen and genital 
tissues were negatively associated with body weight in fawns at the time of death.
FT3 and FT4 results are indicative of basal metabolic rate and thermoregulation27. Fawn and adult female FT3 
values were similar to those reported in other studies, but FT4 results were elevated compared to previous stud-
ies27,46–48. We do not believe that this was the result of imidacloprid, as this pesticide decreases thyroid function in 
rats49, Indian wild birds50, and fish51. Rather, the elevated FT4 values may be due to a combination of pregnancy in 
adult females, the time of year, and artificial feed. Hamr et al.52 found that thyroid hormones of artificially fed deer 
were elevated compared to deer that consumed natural browse. Additionally, this study also found that hormones 
were increased in the spring and summer. Bahnak et al.53 documented that pregnant, penned deer have elevated 
levels of thyroid hormones.
As imidacloprid increased in the spleen, we noted that FT4 levels and spleen size decreased. As stated previ-
ously, imidacloprid has been shown to decrease FT4 levels in other vertebrates49–51. Additionally, research on rats 
has shown that organ weights (specifically liver and spleen) decrease as imidacloprid treatment increases54–56. 
From our observations and previous research, we predict that imidacloprid is suppressing the immune function 
and size of the spleen.
As imidacloprid increased in the genital organs of fawns and adult females, weights of the genital organs 
decreased. Vohra and Khera56 found that, as oral consumption of imidacloprid increased, the ovaries of lab rats 
became smaller but the uterus increased in size. Additional research has shown that liver and spleen sizes will 
decrease as imidacloprid concentration increases; however, there was not an indication that the genital weight 
decreased54–56. Consequently, more research is needed to better understand how imidacloprid and other neonic-
otinoids affect reproductive tissues in mammals.
Behavioral observations indicated that high concentration of imidacloprid in the spleen resulted in less activity 
in adult females and fawns. This finding was similar to results on female rats and their offspring that showed sig-
nificant decreases in grip time as imidacloprid concentrations from intraperitoneal injection increased, an indi-
cation of fatigue45. Rat movement was similarly impaired as imidacloprid (via oral consumption) increased55,57.
Samples of liver and spleen organs were collected from white-tailed deer brought to the NDGF Wildlife Health 
Laboratory for a variety of reasons (e.g., illegal harvest investigations, disease, deer-vehicle collisions) from 2009–
2017 throughout North Dakota.; imidacloprid concentrations were evaluated in 367 samples using the same 
ELISA methods as in our captive experiment. Results indicated that levels of imidacloprid in liver samples were 
2.8 times higher in free-ranging deer in North Dakota [average 1.32 (0.10)] than in livers of our captive deer 
[average 0.46 (0.03)], Table 6. Furthermore, concentrations of imidacloprid in spleen samples from free-ranging 
deer in North Dakota [0.60 (0.06)] were 3.5 times higher than those in spleens of captive deer [0.17 (0.02), 
Table 6] in our experiment. Deer exposure to imidacloprid averaged 52.3 ± 4.6% over the years 2009 to 2017. For 
those free-ranging deer in North Dakota exposed to imidacloprid, average concentrations in spleens increased 
(r = 0.22, p = 0.002) an average of 0.11 ng/g per year from 2009 to 2017. Furthermore, 77.5% of these deer had 
imidacloprid levels in spleens equal to or above 0.33 ng/g (i.e., mean level of imidacloprid in spleens of fawns in 
captivity that died in our experiment). These results indicate that wild populations of deer exposed to imida-
cloprid are potentially experiencing effects similar to those seen in our captive facility experiment; i.e., reduced 
activity in adult females and fawns, and specifically in fawns, decreased survival, size, and health. Consequently, 
additional research is needed to confirm these relationships in free-ranging deer in agricultural landscapes where 
imidacloprid and other neonicotinoid insecticides are utilized.
