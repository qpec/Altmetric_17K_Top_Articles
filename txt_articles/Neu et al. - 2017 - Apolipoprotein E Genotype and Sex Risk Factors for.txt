Abstract
Importance—It is unclear if female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele are at 
greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than men, and the sex-dependent association 
of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and APOE has not been established.
Objective—To determine how sex and APOE genotype affect the risks for developing MCI and 
AD.
Data Sources—Twenty-seven independent research studies in the Global Alzheimer’s 
Association Interactive Network with data on nearly 58,000 subjects.

 Study Selection—Non-Hispanic Caucasians with clinical diagnostic and APOE genotype data.
Data Extraction and Synthesis—Homogeneous data sets were pooled in case-control 
analyses, and logistic regression models were used to compute risks.
Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s)—Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence 
intervals (CIs) for developing MCI and AD were calculated for men and women across APOE 
genotypes.
Results—APOE ε3/ε4 men (OR, 3.09; CI, 2.79 – 3.42) and women (OR, 3.31; CI, 3.03 – 3.61) 
across the lifespan of 55 to 85 years of age did not show a difference in AD risk; however, women 
had an increased risk compared to men between the ages of 65 and 75 (p-value = 0.002). APOE 
ε3/ε4 men had an increased risk of AD compared to APOE ε3/ε3 men (p-value < 0.001). The 
APOE ε2/ε3 genotype conferred a protective effect on women (OR, 0.51; CI, 0.43 – 0.61) 
decreasing their risk of AD more (p-value = 0.01) than men (OR, 0.71; CI, 0.60 – 0.85). There was 
no difference between APOE ε3/ε4 men (OR, 1.55; CI, 1.36 – 1.76) and women (OR, 1.60; CI, 
1.43 – 1.81) in their risk of developing MCI between the ages of 55 and 85, but women had an 
increased risk between 55 and 70 (p-value = 0.05). There were no significant differences between 
men and women in their risks for converting from MCI to AD between the ages of 55 and 85. 
APOE ε4/ε4 individuals showed increased risks over ε3/ε4 individuals for developing AD and 
MCI and converting from MCI to AD.
Conclusions and Relevance—Contrary to long-standing views, men and women with the 
APOE ε3/ε4 genotype have nearly the same odds of developing AD across the age span of 55 to 
85 years, but women have an increased risk at younger ages.
Introduction
For nearly twenty years, the prevalent view has been that women who carry copies of the ε4 
allele of the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene have a greater risk of developing Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD) than men with the same number of copies.1 The ε4 allele is the main genetic 
risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD)2, and sex-based differences in AD risk 
have important implications for treatment trials, diagnostics, and therapeutics3. Additionally, 
the sex-dependent relationship between APOE and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which 
is often a transitional phase from cognitively normal (NL) aging to dementia,4 is unclear. 
Studies are in general agreement that the APOE ε4 allele is a risk factor for developing 
MCI,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 but there is controversy as to whether it increases10,12,13,14 or does not 
increase9,11,15,16 the risks of transitioning from MCI to AD or dementia. The three most 
common alleles of the APOE gene are ε2, ε3, and ε4; whereas carrying the ε4 allele 
increases one’s risk of developing AD, the ε2 allele conversely has a putative protective 
effect that is associated with longevity and a lower AD risk.17
Studies of participants with a family history of late-onset AD have reported that women with 
one copy of ε4 have a greater risk than male heterozygote ε4 carriers, who in turn have 
about the same risk as male ε3 homozygotes18,19. This sex dependence was also found in 
first-degree (parents and siblings) relatives of individuals with AD,20,21 and in the meta-
analysis of Farrer et al.,1 which aggregated data from 40 independent research studies. 
Among studies of residents in city suburbs and communities, there is general agreement that

 elderly female ε4 carriers have an increased risk of AD, dementia, and cognitive decline 
over male ε4 carriers.22,23,24,25. However, when subjects are randomly recruited from 
hospitals, retirement homes, and aging consortiums, most studies have found no sex-specific 
difference between men and women in the risks of AD and dementia associated with the 
APOE ε4 allele26,27,28,29. The sex-dependent role of APOE ε4 in the risks of developing 
MCI and in MCI conversions to AD has been recently investigated,30,3 and there is evidence 
that women are at greater risk than men.
Methods
We collected data sets from 27 independent research studies totaling nearly 58,000 subjects. 
Information was collected on each subject’s APOE genotype, sex, race, ethnicity, diagnosis 
(NL, MCI, AD), and age at diagnosis. From these data sets we included only Caucasian 
subjects that were mostly non-Hispanic.
GAAIN Data Sets
Prospective participants for this meta-analysis were identified using resources1 from the31,32 
Global Alzheimer’s Association Interactive Network (GAAIN). As shown in Table 1, we 
utilized multiple data sets from 12 research institutions in GAAIN, with two institutions 
(NIAGADS, CAMD) managing data from several independent studies. Details of the data 
sets obtained through GAAIN are given in the Data Set Description section in the 
Supplement.
We did not receive information about clinical diagnoses for all subjects, and in some cases 
the ages of elderly subjects were truncated downward to 90 years to protect their identities. 
We excluded subjects with missing information and/or 90 year-truncated ages from all data 
sets. In many data sets, birth dates were rounded to the nearest year as an extra measure to 
protect subject confidentiality. We excluded data from subjects in the NACC data set who 
were also known to have participated in the ADNI study; however, the full extent of the 
subject overlap between NACC and ADNI has not currently been established, but is 
estimated to be at most 3%. Across data sets most subjects were Caucasian, and for many 
subjects, ethnic information was either not collected or not known. Due to insufficient 
numbers of other races, we only included subjects of the Caucasian race (along with subjects 
from the ACE and AIBL data sets) with non-Hispanic or unknown ethnicities. Through our 
correspondences with data set providers, we estimate that Hispanic subjects make up no 
more than 5% of all Caucasian subjects with unknown ethnicities. After applying exclusion 
criteria, these data sets were representative of non-Hispanic Caucasians in North America 
and Europe.
The descriptions of the clinical diagnoses we received were unstandardized32 and the levels 
of detail varied across different data sets according to how each disease was defined (e.g., 
“mild” or “moderate” AD) and how it was recorded (e.g., “AD associated with 
cerebrovascular disease”). We worked directly with each data set provider to translate each 
set of diagnoses into our three general preplanned diagnoses: NL, MCI, and AD. In addition,

 we excluded all subjects with a clinical history of stroke, cerebrovascular disease, Lewy 
bodies, APP or presenilin gene mutations, or comorbidity with any other known 
neurological disease. All subtypes of MCI (e.g., amnestic and non-amnestic) were combined 
into a single MCI diagnosis.
For longitudinal data sets (e.g., NACC and FHS) that had multiple diagnoses per subject, we 
assigned each subject a single diagnosis as follows. Each subject without a history of MCI or 
AD was assigned a NL diagnosis, each subject with a history of MCI and no history of AD 
was assigned an MCI diagnosis, and each subject with a history of AD and no history of 
MCI was assigned an AD diagnosis. Subjects with a history of both MCI and AD were 
randomly assigned either an MCI or AD diagnosis. We used the latest examination age for 
the diagnosis age of NL subjects and the earliest recorded age of MCI or AD for MCI and 
AD subjects, respectively. With the exception of the FHS data set, no subjects were followed 
more than 10 years; therefore, our NL diagnosis ages were not significantly skewed towards 
very old ages. We used these diagnosis assignments to form three case-control study groups 
containing 22 AD-NL, 10 MCI-NL, and 7 AD-MCI data sets.
Statistical Analysis
Meta-analyses of the case-control study groups were conducted using the Mantel-Haenszel 
fixed-effects method to calculate odds ratios for each sex and APOE genotype using the 
APOE ε3/ε3 genotype as the referent. We imputed missing NL data in the ACE, CAMD, 
TGEN2, and ROS/MAP data sets using available NL subject data as follows. The Mann-
Whitney U test was used to compare the age distributions of NL subjects from each research 
study, and dissimilar NL subject data was excluded. In particular, we excluded the ARWIBO 
and WRAP data sets because the median age of their NL subjects was relatively young (mid-
fifties to mid-sixties) and that of the ACT data set was comparatively older (lower eighties). 
Variations in the total numbers of ε2, ε3, and ε4 alleles of NL subjects were then compared 
using the chi-square test of homogeneity ( 
) to exclude correspondingly heterogeneous 
data sets. The resultant NL subject data contained men ( 
) and women ( 
) 
with NL diagnoses from the ADNI, AIBL, NACC, and WashU data sets, respectively. The 
NL subjects used for imputation were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (males: 
, p-
value = 0.39; females: 
, p-value = 0.75), their ages were normally distributed (male 
mean = 73.5 y [SD, 7.0 y]; female mean = 74.6 [SD, 7.1 y]), and their APOE genotype 
frequencies were consistent with those reported for the general population of the United 
States33 (eTable 4 in the Supplement). Forest plots of the log odds ratios for the APOE ε3/ε4 
genotype by sex are shown in eFigures 1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement. Separate meta-
analyses were also performed in three age ranges (55 to 65 years, 65 to 75 years, 75 to 85 
years).
The meta-analyses were repeated after removing ascertainment-biased studies from the case-
control study groups. Community-based studies (ACE, ARWIBO, FHS) that recruited 
participants in localized geographic regions and disease-biased studies (NIA-LOAD, 
TGEN2) that recruited participants with family histories of AD were excluded. The

 ROS/MAP study was also excluded because we did not have enough information to 
definitively remove subjects with comorbidities from its data set.
Data from each ascertainment-adjusted case-control study group was then pooled together 
and logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for each sex and APOE genotype 
(Table 2). For each sex, a continuous age variable and five indicator (values of one or zero) 
variables representing the five APOE genotypes (ε2/ε2, ε2/ε3, ε2/ε4, ε3/ε4, and ε4/ε4) 
were used with the APOE ε3/ε3 genotype as the referent. We also conducted another pooled 
analysis where we added a sex indicator variable and five additional covariates that were 
products of the sex variable with each APOE genotype variable in order to test for sex 
interactions. The age-dependent curves shown in Figure 2 were derived by adding several 
quadratic covariate products to the logistic regression that were created by combining APOE 
genotype, sex, and age. Because the NACC data set was predominantly larger (48% - 85%) 
than other data sets in the pooled analysis, we separated it from the pooled data and repeated 
the analyses without it and exclusively with it. Results of all the above analyses are listed in 
eTables 1, 2, and 3 in the Supplement for the APOE ε3/ε4 genotype.
Statistical analyses were performed in R2 (version 3.3.1) using the “metafor” meta-analysis 
package (version 1.9-9) along with the “glm” generalized linear model function. 
Mathematica3 (version 10.0) was used for curve fitting and plotting.
Results
From an aggregation of 27 independent research studies with a total of 57,979 subjects 
(Table 1), meta-analyses were performed on 31,340 non-Hispanic Caucasians with clinical 
diagnoses between the ages of 55 and 85 in three case-control analyses (Figure 1). After 
excluding ascertainment-biased studies, the data in each analysis was pooled and odds ratios 
for each sex and APOE genotype (Table 2) were calculated. In all case-control analyses, 
between-study heterogeneity was reduced after the removal of ascertainment-biased study 
data. However, p-values from Tarone’s34 test of heterogeneity (Table 2) still detected 
significant study heterogeneity in the female APOE ε3/ε4 data (p-value = 0.03) and in the 
APOE ε4/ε4 data (male p-value = 0.02; female p-value < 0.001) of the AD-NL analysis. 
Upon further investigation (eTable 1 of the Supplement), we found that the heterogeneity in 
the female APOE ε3/ε4 data was localized to the ages of 75 to 85 years (p-value = 0.003). 
This determination was supported after comparing the odds ratios in that age range from 
analyses without the NACC data set (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 2.23-3.21) and with the NACC data 
set exclusively (OR, 4.12; 95% CI, 3.41-4.98). Otherwise, between the ages of 55 and 85, 
the 95% confidence intervals of the odds ratios calculated from pooled data without the 
NACC data set overlapped the confidence intervals of the odds ratios calculated using the 
NACC data set alone.
As shown in Table 2, men and women with the APOE ε3/ε4 genotype had the same risks of 
developing AD (men OR, 3.09 [95% CI, 2.79 – 3.42]; women OR, 3.31 [95% CI, 3.03 –

 3.61]; APOE-sex interaction p-value = 0.47) between the ages of 55 and 85. APOE ε3/ε4 
men had an increased risk of AD compared to ε3/ε3 men (p-value < 0.001). The APOE ε2/
ε3 genotype decreased the risk of AD more for women than for men (women OR, 0.51 [95% 
CI, 0.43 – 0.61]; men OR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.60 – 0.85]; APOE-sex interaction p-value = 
0.01). Men and women with the APOE ε3/ε4 genotype had the same risks of developing 
MCI between the ages of 55 and 85 (men OR, 1.55 [95% CI, 1.36 – 1.76]; women OR, 1.60 
[95% CI, 1.43 – 1.81]; APOE-sex interaction p-value = 0.82).
Odds ratio curves for males and females with the APOE ε3/ε4 genotype are shown in Figure 
2 between the ages of 55 and 85. The odds ratios calculated from the pooled data analyses in 
three age ranges (55 to 65 years, 65 to 75 years, 75 to 85 years) are plotted for each sex with 
error bars indicating their 95% confidence intervals. As shown in the top plot between the 
ages of 65 and 75, APOE ε3/ε4 women had an increased risk of AD compared to ε3/ε4 men 
(women OR, 4.37 [95% CI, 3.82 – 5.00]; men OR, 3.14 [95% CI, 2.68 – 3.67]; APOE-sex 
interaction p-value = 0.002). In the middle plot, the odds ratio curves suggested that APOE 
ε3/ε4 women were at higher risk for developing MCI than men between the ages of 55 and 
70, which was confirmed in a separate analysis in that age range (women OR, 1.43 [95% CI, 
1.19 – 1.73]; men OR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.87 – 1.30]; APOE-sex interaction p-value = 0.05). 
No significant risk differences between men and women for MCI to AD transitions were 
found in the lower plot, but the odds ratio curves parallel a previous study that found that 
APOE ε4 increased the risk of transitioning from MCI to AD between the ages of 70 to 85, 
but not between the ages of 55 to 69.16
Discussion
When examining the entire age span from 55 to 85 years of age, men and women with the 
APOE ε3/ε4 genotype had nearly the same odds of developing MCI and AD, both in 
comparisons between data sets and in data set aggregation. Notably, women had an 
increased risk of MCI between the ages of 55 and 70 and an increased risk of AD between 
the ages of 65 and 75. These results are consistent with a previous study that found a 
significant association between APOE ε4 and cognitive decline between the ages of 70 to 80 
in women only,24 and with another study that found that episodic memory was more 
impaired in APOE ε3/ε4 women than in ε3/ε4 men between the ages of 70 to 74.25 
Mechanisms that underlie these sex differences may be linked to physiologic changes 
associated with menopause and estrogen loss that on average begin at 51 years of age35 just 
prior to our risk groups. Studies in animals and humans have reported an interaction between 
APOE ε4, menopause, and cognitive decline (for a review, see reference 36). Furthermore, 
other evidence suggests that carrying one copy of APOE ε4 shifts the age of onset in 
women, but not in men18. Collectively, our findings along with previous work warrant 
further investigation into a likely complex set of risk factors with consideration of sex-
specific treatments for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease. For example, if women 
are at increased risk for Alzheimer’s disease at younger ages, it is plausible that treatments 
for women may need to be initiated earlier, especially in those who carry an APOE ε4 allele. 
Both APOE ε3/ε4 men and women had an increased risk of AD compared to ε3/ε3 men and 
women, respectively. The APOE ε2/ε3 genotype conferred more of a protective effect on 
women, decreasing their risk of AD more than men. No significant sex-dependent

 differences were found for transitioning between MCI and AD. Our odds ratios for 
developing MCI are consistent with other studies.6,37
After adjusting for NL subject differences between AD studies by replacing NL subjects 
with the data set we used for imputation, there was significant variation of AD risk between 
data sets; the male and female ε3/ε4 odds ratios were near one for the ACE data set and 
nearly seven for the NIA-LOAD data set. In retrospect, high odds ratios were not remarkable 
for the NIA-LOAD study, which recruited families with two or more affected siblings with 
AD, because family history of AD is an AD risk factor and the probability of carrying a 
genetic mutation in a recognized AD gene increases with the number of first-degree relatives 
affected with AD.38 The lowest odds ratios tended to be associated with community-based 
studies (e.g., ACE, ARWIBO, and FHS) that ascertained subjects from geographically 
specific cities and suburbs. As shown in eFigure 4, most data points clustered around the 
NACC data point; these studies primarily recruited random subjects who were unrelated to 
one another.
These results are notably different from those of Farrer et al.1, who found that the relative 
odds of ε3/ε4 women compared to ε3/ε4 men for developing AD were about 1.5, and that 
ε3/ε3 and ε3/ε4 men had the same AD risks when subjects were ascertained from clinics/
hospitals and autopsies/brain banks (n=6,305). Many of the subjects in their meta-analysis 
had family histories of AD, they noted differences with population-based studies, and they 
aggregated subjects with early-onset AD. Inclusion of the latter subjects could help explain 
why their AD odds ratio curves for ε3/ε4 individuals reached their maxima around ages 60 
to 65, as opposed to ours which reached their maxima around the ages of 73 to 80. These 
results are in closer agreement with studies that have found ε3/ε4 carriers to have a mean 
age of clinical onset of 76 years, and the risk for developing late-onset AD to occur 
primarily between the ages of 60 to 79.26 We note that between the ages of 65 to 75, the 
odds ratios of APOE ε3/ε4 women and men differed by a factor of about 1.5, which is 
consistent with Farrer’s results across all ages. Our result that the APOE ε2/ε3 genotype 
decreased the risk of AD more for women than for men is the opposite of what they found; 
this is likely due to the fact that our analysis (n=1482) used more than three the number of 
subjects than they used (n=447).
In agreement with previous studies1,39, we found that individuals with two copies of the 
APOE ε4 allele were at greater risk for developing AD than individuals with only one copy. 
No significant differences between ε4/ε4 men and women were seen in their risks for 
developing AD, which is consistent with the results reported by Farrer. APOE ε4 
homozygotes also had increased risks compared to ε4 heterozygotes for MCI and for 
transitioning from MCI to AD.
Ascertainment biases are known to modify the true effects of APOE on the risks of 
developing AD, and they may have played a role in the variations we found between data 
sets. Men have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and stroke than women, so men who 
live to old age may be healthier than women of the same age and therefore have lesser risks 
of developing AD.40,41 On average women live longer than men, which makes it difficult to 
locate older men with AD in sufficient numbers to study. There may be increased study

 participation rates among individuals with a family history of AD,42 which is an established 
risk factor for developing AD.43,44,45 Population-based studies can oversample participants 
from families in areas where widows outnumber widowers.23 Non-responders are generally 
burdened with higher rates of illness than responders to surveys and they require extra effort 
to participate.46 Biases may occur when recruitment and dropout occur continuously 
throughout studies,29 or when individuals do not consent to or are not available for 
genotyping. A notable example of ascertainment bias occurred in a study that compared 
subjects sampled from a research clinic with subjects recruited through a health maintenance 
organization; they found that the research-based cohort contained younger subjects, more 
severe AD cases, and a higher APOE ε4 allele frequency.47
Variability in the methodologies used to define AD and MCI across data sets could have 
affected our results. We relied upon the expertise of each data set provider to translate their 
diagnostic definitions into our general AD and MCI diagnoses independently of other data 
set providers. Although it would have been preferable to use MCI subtypes (e.g., amnestic, 
non-amnestic), that level of diagnostic detail was mostly unavailable. We could not adjust 
for known AD risk factors such as the number of years of education and family history of 
AD/dementia because in many data sets that information was not provided. Nor could we 
account for sex-dependent differences due to factors such as cigarette smoking, hormonal 
changes with age, and alcohol usage48. As was previously mentioned, in some data sets the 
birth dates of subjects were rounded to the nearest year, and that limited the accuracy in 
determining the onset ages of AD and MCI. Finally, we were not able to fully exclude all 
Hispanic subjects from our meta-analysis because in many cases information about ethnicity 
was not collected. Although we believe the percentage of Hispanic subjects to be less than 
5%, this could have affected our results since the odds of developing AD is different among 
Hispanics than in Caucasians.1 Taken together, limited information on risk factors were not 
modeled in our analysis due to our large pooled cohort approach. Of particular note, lifestyle 
factors such as lower educational attainment and vascular risk factors are well-documented 
contributors to Alzheimer’s risk49 and could have influenced our findings.

 Key Points
Question
Are female carriers of the Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele at greater risk of developing 
Alzheimer’s disease than men?
Findings
In this meta-analysis of 27 independent research studies with 58,000 subjects, women 
and men with one copy of Apolipoprotein E ε4 did not show a difference in risk of 
Alzheimer’s disease across the lifespan of 55 to 85 years of age. However, these women 
were at increased risk over men between the ages of 65 and 75.
Meaning
Sex-specific treatments for cognitive decline and Alzheimer’s disease may need to be 
initiated a younger age, especially those who carry an Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele.

 Figure 2. 
Alzheimer’s disease and mild cognitive impairment odds ratios for men and women with 
APOE ε3/ε4 genotypes between the ages of 55 and 85.
AD and MCI risk factors were calculated for men and women between the ages of 55 and 85 
for each APOE genotype. Age-adjusted odds ratios are listed in Table 2 and shown in Figure 
2 as a function of age for the APOE ε3/ε4 genotype. All male odds ratios were calculated 
relative to ε3/ε3 men, and all female odds ratios relative to ε3/ε3 women. Three conversion 
cases were considered: (1) developing AD from a cognitively normal (NL) status, (2)

is labeled AD-NL, MCI-NL, and AD-MCI, respectively, in Table 2 and Figure 2.
