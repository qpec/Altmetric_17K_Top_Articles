Chimpanzees’ refusal of less-preferred food when an experimenter has
previously provided preferred food to a conspecific has been taken as
evidence for a sense of fairness. Here, we present a novel hypothesis—the
social disappointment hypothesis—according to which food refusals express
chimpanzees’ disappointment in the human experimenter for not rewarding
them as well as they could have. We tested this hypothesis using a two-by-
two design in which food was either distributed by an experimenter or a
machine and with a partner present or absent. We found that chimpanzees
were more likely to reject food when it was distributed by an experimenter
rather than by a machine and that they were not more likely to do so when a
partner was present. These results suggest that chimpanzees’ refusal of less-
preferred food stems from social disappointment in the experimenter and
not from a sense of fairness.
1. Introduction
One key challenge in sustaining cooperation lies in distributing collaboratively
acquired resources so that everyone is satisfied and motivated to collaborate in
the future [1–5]. To resolve situations in which individuals with conflicting inter-
ests have to agree on resource distribution, humans use a variety of fairness
principles such as merit, authority, need and equality [6–10]. Humans’ sense of
fairness is most clearlyexpressed ina strong aversion to inequity, which culminates
inthe often costly punishment of unfair behaviour, even bythird partiesthat donot
personallysuffer from inequity [11–14]. According to some theorists, sensitivity to
fairness has played a key role in stabilizing cooperation during human evolution
[1,2,12]. However, as other animals also engage in stable patterns of cooperation
[4,15–22], there is considerable debate about the extent to which a sense of fairness
and a concomitant aversion to inequity is uniquely human [23–33].
A variety of experimental designs (e.g. the ultimatum game) have been used
to examine sensitivity to equity [34–36]. The best evidence for a sense of fairness
in non-human animals comes from an ingenious experimental paradigm first
developed for capuchin monkeys by Brosnan & de Waal [23], known as the
inequity aversion task. The prototypical version of this task comprises a series
of exchange interactions involving three agents: an experimenter, an advantaged
recipient and a disadvantaged recipient. The two recipients engage in the same
effortful task (e.g. handing back a token), but while the first receives preferred
food from a human experimenter, the second recipient is offered less-preferred
food. The main finding is that individuals from various species of primates
reject the less-preferred food (food that they would otherwise readily accept) if
a conspecific gets better food for the same effort [28]. A similar pattern of behav-
iour has recently been demonstrated in various species outside the primate taxa,
such as domestic dogs, rats, and possibly crows and ravens [37–42]. The question
from a psychological point of view is: how are rejections of the less-preferred
food to be interpreted.

 One hypothesis is the inequity aversion hypothesis.
Brosnan & de Waal [23,28], for example, interpret food rejec-
tions in the inequity aversion task as indicative of social
comparison and thus ultimately of a burgeoning sense of
fairness. They argue that when individuals see that a conspe-
cific gets better food for the same effort, they feel that they are
treated unfairly and protest by refusing to accept the food
offered to them. Thus, according to the inequity aversion
hypothesis,
individuals’
refusals
of
less-preferred
food
are all about the partner: subjects react negatively to receiv-
ing less than a partner. However, a number of subsequent
studies have failed to replicate these original results and
provided additional data that pointed to an alternative
explanation for food refusals: the food expectation hypothesis
[25,26,29,43,44]. According to this hypothesis, recipients
simply see the preferred food or observe a conspecific receiv-
ing preferred food and expect that they will receive the
preferred food as well. When individuals then receive
the non-preferred food, this expectation is violated, and they
subsequently react by refusing to accept the less-preferred
food. One version of the food expectation hypothesis is the
frustration hypothesis [45–47]. The well-known frustration
effect (also known as contrast effect) typically occurs in situ-
ations where subjects first receive a preferred reward,
followed by a less-preferred reward. Individuals’ rejection
of the less-preferred food in such cases is linked to the
change of food quality experienced by the subject and not
to the subject expecting to receive preferred food because
her partner received preferred food. According to the
food expectation and the frustration hypotheses, individuals’
behaviour in the inequity aversion paradigm is all about
the
food:
subjects
react
negatively
to
receiving
the
less-preferred food because they expect preferred food.
Here, we propose and experimentally investigate a novel
hypothesis:
the
social
disappointment
hypothesis.
This
hypothesis postulates that individuals in the inequity aversion
task do not object to how they are treated in comparison to
how another is treated but simply to how they are treated rela-
tive to how they could be treated by the human experimenter
[1,48–51]. Chimpanzees are disappointed by the actions of an
experimenter who has the ability to reward them with a pre-
ferred food item but distributes a non-preferred food item
instead. The social disappointment hypothesis is grounded
in experimental and observational evidence suggesting that
chimpanzee cooperation is mostly regulated through so-called
emotional bookkeeping in dyadic social bonds [52–56]. In line
with these results, the current hypothesis maintains that
chimpanzees’ responses in the inequity aversion task reflect
a dyadic response to how they are treated by the exper-
imenter—independent of any social comparison with the
partner. More specifically, individuals’ emotional expressions
and refusals to accept the less-preferred reward convey disap-
pointment with the human experimenter for providing a poor
piece of food when she could have provided a better one. The
social disappointment displayed by individuals in the inequity
aversion task is therefore a distinctively interpersonal emotion-
al reaction to being treated worse than one expected to be
treated. This implies that the inequity aversion task reveals
special expectations of social agents and not fairness consider-
ations. The social disappointment hypothesis thus focuses on
a relationship that has received very little attention from
other theorists: that between experimenter and disadvantaged
recipient. According to this hypothesis, refusals of less-
preferred food are all about the experimenter: individuals
react negatively to receiving worse treatment than they
expected to receive from the human experimenter. The social
disappointment hypothesis differs from the inequity aversion
hypothesis in that it is dyadic in nature (involving the subject
and experimenter) and does not require complex tracking
and comparing of relative pay-offs across multiple ongoing
social interactions but instead only a fairly straightforward
evaluation of how one is treated by the human experimenter
(in comparison to how one could be treated). In compari-
son to the food expectation and frustration hypotheses, it
differs in that it is decidedly social in character and
expresses disappointment with social content.
We
tested
the
social
disappointment
hypothesis
in
chimpanzees and compared our results with other expla-
nations for refusals in the inequity aversion task. In order
to do so, we combined the central elements of each hypoth-
esis.
The
key
variable
for
the
social
disappointment
hypothesis is whether an experimenter is present or not. In
the current set-up, food was thus distributed either by the
experimenter or, in the absence of the experimenter, by a
machine. The social disappointment hypothesis argues that
chimpanzees’
negative
reactions
to
receiving
the
less-
preferred food are grounded in interpersonal expectations
of social agents (i.e. the human experimenter), and a
distributing machine should not elicit such expectations.
While such methods, to our knowledge, have never been
implemented
in
studies
with
non-human
primates,
it
should be noted that a recent study by Brucks et al. [57] pre-
sents preliminary evidence that dogs react differently—at
least on some measures—to unequal distributions that are
created by an experimenter versus a machine.
The key to the inequity aversion hypothesis is to manip-
ulate whether a conspecific partner is present or not.
Therefore, in our experiment, food was distributed either in
the presence or absence of a conspecific partner. In a set-up
manipulating these two factors, the social disappointment
hypothesis predicts that recipients should be more likely to
refuse the less-preferred food when they interact with a
human experimenter rather than with a machine, and that
their refusal should not be influenced by the absence or pres-
ence of a conspecific partner who receives the preferred food.
This is in notable contrast with the inequity aversion hypoth-
esis, which predicts that the type of food distributor (human
or machine) should have no influence on individuals’ refusals
and that subjects should be more likely to reject food with a
conspecific partner present. The food expectation and the
frustration hypotheses both predict that the type of distribu-
tor and the absence/presence of a conspecific partner should
make no difference to individuals’ reactions to receiving the
less-preferred food.
Finally,
the
set-up
of
our
inequity
aversion
task
conformed to the two characteristics highlighted by Brosnan
& de Waal [28] as especially relevant to eliciting responses to
inequity. First, chimpanzees had to engage in a task in order
to receive their rewards: they had to take a tool from an
apparatus and reinsert it in order to gain access to food.
Second,
chimpanzees
were
seated
closely
side-by-side,
which allowed for clear visibility of the respective rewards
(figure 1). Our main measure, based on previous studies
[24], was chimpanzees’ rate of refusal to exchange their tool
for food. As this represents a demanding measure in requir-
ing subjects to reject otherwise palatable food, we also

2
 included an additional, non-costly option to reject the exper-
imenter’s (or the machine’s) distribution, which we called the
opt-out possibility. Following previous work [29], subjects
thus had the possibility to reject a given distribution without
having to give up access to food.
2. Material and methods
(a) Subjects
Nine chimpanzees (five males and four females) ranging in age
from 7 to 42 years (M ¼ 17.2 years) participated in the study
(see the electronic supplementary material, table S1). The sub-
jects were housed in two social groups at the Wolfgang Ko
¨hler
Primate Research Center in the Leipzig Zoo (Leipzig, Germany).
Of the participants, four acted solely as subjects (M ¼ 13.3 years)
and five acted as both the partner and the subject (M ¼ 20.4
years; see the electronic supplementary material, table S2). Two
of the subjects were nursery-reared, six were mother-reared
and one (Frederike) is without a documented rearing history
(see the electronic supplementary material, table S1).
Chimpanzees had access to a large outdoor enclosure during
the day and received regular daily feedings, daily enrichment
and water ad libitum. Subjects voluntarily participated in the
study and were never food or water deprived.
(b) Materials
Two apparatuses were used during testing: the main apparatus
and the opt-out apparatus. The main apparatus consisted of
two identical units that mirrored each other when affixed to
the mesh. One unit was attached to the partner’s room and the
other was attached to the subject’s room. Each participant
could only access their portion of the apparatus (figure 1). In
the upper section of each unit, there were two food platforms
and a slot where subjects could take the tool. In the middle
section, there was a food trap that was hidden from both partici-
pants’ view. The lower portion comprised a food table and a tool
reinsertion hole. Food from the food table could only be accessed
when the tool was inserted into the hole (in the default position
the food was blocked by a window). Importantly, participants
could no longer access tools after they had been fully reinserted.
The sides of the apparatus flush with the mesh were transparent,
which allowed each participant to clearly see each other’s food
on the food platforms and the food on the food tables following
distribution. Thus, the main apparatus functioned as follows:
once participants removed the tool from the main apparatus,
food pieces were distributed either by the experimenter or the
machine (depending on condition). The distributor placed one
piece of food on the food table (where food could be accessed)
and the other piece of food in the food trap (where foods
could not be accessed). If participants chose to reinsert the tool
into the main apparatus, they thereby gained access to the food
placed on the food table.
Alternatively, during the test phase, participants could
decide to insert the tool (once they had removed it from the
main apparatus) into the opt-out apparatus. The opt-out appar-
atus was attached outside of the mesh on the wall of the
subject’s room running along the hallway (figure 1). The
opt-out consisted of a food table and a tool reinsertion hole.

that for purposes of clarity, the food trap in the main apparatus is not shown. Blue items represent high-value foods and red items represent low-value foods. By
removing the tool (located in-between the two food platforms) and re-inserting it in the hole next to the food table (located below the two food platforms),
chimpanzees could access the food that had been distributed by either the experimenter or the machine. The different images depict each condition of our 2 � 2

 As with the main apparatus, a Plexiglas window sat flush against
the mesh and would drop when the tool was completely
reinserted. If subjects inserted the tool into the opt-out apparatus,
they could access the food from the food table.
(c) Procedure and design
(i) Design
We employed a 2 � 2 design with distributor (human versus
machine) as a between-subjects factor and partner presence
(partner present versus partner absent) as a within-subjects
factor. The procedure consisted of three consecutive steps: a
food preference test (see the electronic supplementary material),
a
familiarization
phase
(see
the
electronic
supplementary
material) and the test phase.
(ii) Test phase
In a mixed design, subjects completed four test sessions (each
comprising 24 trials) on four days in the same distribution groups
(human or machine) as they were assigned during familiariz-
ation. Subjects were tested for two consecutive sessions with a
partner and two consecutive sessions without a partner. Whether
the subject started testing with a partner or without was counter-
balanced (for details on subjects, partners and counterbalancing
see the electronic supplementary material, table S2). At the
beginning of each trial, a second experimenter baited the part-
ner’s food platforms and the subject’s food platforms with both
high-value food (HV) and low-value food (LV), and the
opt-out apparatus with LV food. During the test phase, the
first experimenter (E1) made the tools accessible to the chimpan-
zees (either directly in the human condition or from outside
the testing room in the machine condition) and the second exper-
imenter was responsible for resetting and rebaiting the apparatus
(for details, see the electronic supplementary material). Below,
each of the four conditions is described in detail.
Human/partner condition (figure 1a; electronic supplementary
material, video S1). In this condition, the experimenter distribu-
ted the pieces of food. First, the tool was made accessible to
the partner (E1 did so by pulling a concealed rope). Once the
partner removed the tool from the slot in her portion of the
main apparatus, E1 distributed the food placing the HV food
onto the food table and the LV food in the food trap. Next, the
partner inserted the tool into the apparatus and obtained and
consumed the HV food. Then, it was the subject’s turn. E1
made the tool in the subject’s portion of the main apparatus
accessible approximately 10 s after food distribution for the part-
ner (or, if the partner took longer, once the partner had accessed
the HV food). The procedure for the subject was exactly the same
as for the partner except that LV food was now placed on the
food table and HV food went in the trap. In all four conditions,
subjects could only see the food distribution after they had
removed the tool. Also in all four conditions, the trial ended
once the subject completed the exchange by re-inserting the
tool into the main apparatus and consumed the food, inserted
the tool into the opt-out or refused to exchange the tool (see
the Coding section).
Human/no partner condition (figure 1c; electronic supplemen-
tary material, video S2). This condition was identical to the
human/partner condition except for the absence of a partner: the
subject was the only chimpanzee present. Both the partner’s
and the subject’s portion of the main apparatus were still
baited with LV and HV food. First, E1 distributed the foods on
the partner’s side of the main apparatus, placing the HV food
onto the food table and the LV food in the food trap. Approxi-
mately 10 s after this food distribution, E1 made the tool
available to the subject. The remaining part of this condition
was identical to the human/partner condition.
Machine/partner condition (figure 1b; electronic supplemen-
tary material, video S3). In this condition, the experimenter
was outside of the room. Both chimpanzees, subject and partner,
were present. First, to make the partner’s tool accessible, E1
pulled a rope from outside the testing room. When the partner
took the tool, food was distributed automatically (as a result of
the partner removing the tool): HV food fell onto the food
table and LV food fell into the food trap. Approximately 10 s
after the automatic food distribution for the partner (or once
the partner had accessed the HV food), E1 made the subject’s
tool accessible (again by pulling a rope from outside the testing
room). The procedure for the subject was the same as for the
partner, except the subject received LV food (HV food fell into
the food trap and LV food fell onto the food table).
Machine/no partner condition (figure 1d; electronic supplemen-
tary material, video S4). In this condition, the subject was the only
chimpanzee present in the testing room. First, E1 pulled a rope
from outside the testing room to make the partner’s tool accessi-
ble. Then, since there was no partner chimpanzee to remove the
tool, E1 pulled a second rope that allowed for the platforms to
automatically tilt and distribute the food. The remaining part of
this condition was identical to the machine/partner condition.
(d) Coding
All trials were videotaped with two cameras. We coded all trials
live as well as after testing from video. For our analysis, we only
included trials in which subjects initiated the trial by removing
the tool from the apparatus within 30 s of it being made available
and thus saw the distribution of foods (see electronic supple-
mentary material, table S3). After subjects took the tool, their
behaviour was coded in one of three ways: refusal to exchange;
choice of opt-out apparatus; completed exchange with the
main apparatus.
(i) Refusal to exchange
Our main analysis was based on refusals to exchange. Cases in
which the subject chose not to insert the tool into either appar-
atus within 30 s of the tool’s removal were coded as refusals to
exchange. Refusal to exchange included behaviours such as
moving to the corner of the room with the tool (see the electro-
nic supplementary material, video S2), dropping the tool on
the floor or throwing the tool out of the room (see the electronic
supplementary material, video S1).
Initially, we further divided refusals to exchange into
(i) active and passive refusals (active refusals to exchange
included instances in which the subject expelled the tool from
the testing room while passive refusals to exchange included
instances in which the tool stayed in the testing room for the
30 s duration/refusal window); and (ii) refusals to consume (if
the subject reinserted the tool into the main apparatus but did
not consume the distributed food within 30 s, a refusal to con-
sume was coded). However, because both active refusals to
exchange and refusals to consume were extremely rare (subjects
showed active refusals to exchange in only 1.6% of trials and
refusals to consume in 1.1% of trials), we collapsed the data
into one category: refusal to exchange.
(ii) Choice of opt-out apparatus
Our secondary analysis was based on the opt-out apparatus. If
the subject chose to insert the tool into the opt-out apparatus,
the choice was coded as ‘opt-out’.
(iii) Completed exchange with the main apparatus
If the subject successfully took the tool, reinserted the tool into
the main apparatus, and then consumed the distributed food,
rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org
Proc. R. Soc. B 284: 20171502

 the trial was coded as a completed exchange (see the electronic
supplementary material, videos S3 and S4).
A research assistant naive to the study design and the
hypothesis independently coded 25% of the trials. Interrater
agreement was excellent (Cohen’s k ¼ 0.97).
Finally, for one-quarter of all trials, we also coded any form
of arousal shown by chimpanzees. This is generally taken as a
measure for anger/frustration, and we coded for any of the fol-
lowing behaviours: displaying, begging, hitting the apparatus,
throwing the tool, foot stomping and handclapping. However,
as behaviours that fit one of these categories appeared in only
5.2% of coded trials, we did not code the full sample.
3. Results
We ran a generalized linear mixed model to examine whether
the distributor (human or machine) or partner presence (yes
or no) had an effect on chimpanzees’ refusal to exchange. We
included the two-way interaction between distributor and
partner presence as well as trial, session, sex and chimpanzee
group (subjects were recruited from two different groups, see
the Material and methods section) as test predictors in the
model. To control for potential effects of the sequence
which subjects were tested (with or without partner first),
we also included counterbalance as a fixed effect into the
model. To test the effect of the test predictors, we compared
the deviance full model with that of the reduced model (com-
prising all terms except for the test predictors) using a
likelihood ratio test. Overall, the full model was highly sig-
nificant when compared with the null model (likelihood
ratio test: x2
3 ¼ 27.44, p ¼,0.001). Specifically, we found a
significant interaction between distributor and partner pres-
ence (estimate+s.e. ¼ 3.08 +1.51, z ¼ 2.04, p ¼ 0.01). To
further investigate the interaction between distributor and
partner presence we conducted post hoc pairwise compari-
sons. Both conditions involving the human experimenter
were significantly different from the conditions involving
the
machine
(human/no
partner and
machine/no
partner:
p ¼ ,0.001;
human/no
partner
and
machine/partner:
p ¼ ,0.001; human/partner and machine/partner: p ¼ 0.012;
human/partner and machine/no partner: p ¼ 0.006), revealing
that subjects were more likely to refuse to exchange when
food was distributed by a human experimenter rather than
by a machine (figure 2).
In addition, we found a significant difference between
the human/no partner and the human/partner conditions
( p ¼ ,0.001), indicating that when the human distributed
food, the chimpanzees refused to exchange more when there
was no partner. There was no difference when comparing the
machine/no partner and the machine/partner conditions (p ¼ 0.84).
Finally, there was no effect of trial (estimate+s.e. ¼ 20.63+
0.58, z ¼ 21.09, p ¼ 0.27), session (estimate+s.e. ¼ 21.82+
1.32, z ¼ 21.37, p ¼ 0.18), sex (estimate+ s.e. ¼ 20.97+0.84,
z ¼ 21.16,
p ¼ 0.22)
and
chimpanzee
group
(estimate+
s.e. ¼ 20.49+0.91, z ¼ 20.54, p ¼ 0.58).
In a second model, we examined whether the distributor
or presence of a partner had an effect on chimpanzees’ choos-
ing to opt-out. As in the first model, we included the
two-way interaction between distributor and partner pres-
ence as well as trial, session, sex and chimpanzee group as
test predictors in the model. To control for potential effects
of the sequence in which subjects were tested (with or with-
out partner first), we also included counterbalance as a fixed
effect into the model. To test the effect of the test predictors,
we compared the deviance full model with that of the
reduced model (comprising all terms except for the test pre-
dictors)
using
a
likelihood
ratio
test.
The
comparison
between the full and null model was not significant (likeli-
hood ratio test: x2
3 ¼ 4.00, p ¼ 0.26), suggesting that the
tested effects did not have a significant effect on the chimpan-
zees’ selection of the opt-out. Please refer to the electronic
supplementary material for details on both models.
4. Discussion
The current results provide support for the social disappoint-
ment
hypothesis:
chimpanzees’
reactions
to
receiving
less-preferred food in the inequity aversion task are grounded
in specific expectations of the experimenter. When chimpan-
zees
received
less-preferred
food
from
a
human
experimenter, they refused to accept the food in more than a
quarter of trials (26.1%), while their average refusal rates
tended towards zero when food was distributed by a machine
(2.4%). In addition, seeing a partner receive the preferred
reward for the same effort did not increase rates of refusal.
On the contrary, chimpanzees were most likely to reject less-
preferred food when a partner was absent and food was
distributed by the human experimenter. Chimpanzees’ re-
actions to receiving the less-preferred food from the human
experimenter ranged from active protests, such as those
observed in capuchin monkeys in the original Brosnan & de
Waal study [23] (e.g. throwing the tool at the experimenter,
see the electronic supplementary material, video S1), to more
passive forms of protest, which comprised the great majority
of refusals (e.g. simply dropping the tool on the ground
and moving to a corner of the room, see the electronic
supplementary material, video S2).
The current results provide no support for the inequity
aversion hypothesis [23,28]. If chimpanzees engage in social
comparison and show a concern for relative pay-offs, they
should refuse food more often in the presence of a partner
regardless of whether the food was distributed by a human
experimenter or a machine. In addition, the current results
also do not support the food expectation hypothesis [25]
which argues that chimpanzees’ negative reactions to receiv-
ing the less-preferred food are rooted in expectations for

 receiving the preferred food. Chimpanzees should have
expected the preferred food in all conditions equally because
it was always present and clearly visible in the apparatus.
Alternatively, subjects might have expected preferred food
specifically in conditions in which partners were present
and received the preferred food, but we did not find that
chimpanzees were more likely to reject food in these
situations either. During stages 4 and 5 of the familiarization,
just before they started the test phase, subjects received the
preferred food. The current study thus also allows for a test
of the frustration hypothesis [47] or the idea that subjects
react negatively to a lesser reward after having just received
a better reward (contrast effects). However, this hypothesis
predicts equal rates of rejection in all conditions, which we
did not find. Subjects were much more likely to reject less-
preferred food when they interacted with an experimenter
rather than with a machine.
An alternative interpretation of this finding is that chim-
panzees rejected more food in the human conditions not as
a consequence of disappointment with the experimenter,
but with the single goal of changing the experimenter’s be-
haviour during the trial or in future trials. This line of
argument suggests that subjects did not protest against the
machine’s distribution because they did not expect to be
able to modify the machine’s current or future behaviour.
On one level, chimpanzees’ negative responses to poor treat-
ment in a cooperative dyad can of course be understood as an
attempt to modify their partner’s future behaviour. However,
the pattern of behaviours shown by chimpanzees in the cur-
rent study makes it very unlikely that chimpanzees refused to
exchange more in human conditions with only the instru-
mental aim of changing the experimenter’s behaviour (and
without any corresponding feelings of disappointment).
First of all, chimpanzees showed active refusals (such as
throwing the tool at the experimenter) in less than 2% of all
trials. Active protest directed at the experimenter such as dis-
playing, foot stomping, or hitting the apparatus, also
occurred very rarely, in approximately 5% of trials. Finally,
subjects’ begging for the preferred food from the experimenter
was virtually non-existent. If subjects were simply attempting
to change the experimenter’s behaviour one would expect
much more active forms of refusal and protest. The majority
of trials included passive refusals to exchange the tool (see
the Coding section) in which subjects moved away from the
apparatus to sit in a corner of the testing room, sometimes
even dropping the tool on the floor while doing so.
Previous research with domestic dogs has provided pre-
liminary
evidence
that
the
role
of
the
experimenter
influences subjects’ responses in the inequity aversion para-
digm [57], but did not provide evidence that dogs are more
likely to reject unequal distributions when the experimenter
was present versus absent. Consequently, this is, to our
knowledge, the first research to show that individuals are
in fact more likely to reject food when it is offered by a
human experimenter compared to a machine and suggests
that chimpanzees’ food refusals are grounded in distinct
social expectations of the human experimenter. An important
and interesting question is how to best characterize chimpan-
zees’ emotional reaction to receiving the less-preferred food.
The prototypical human reaction to being wronged by a
cooperative partner is resentment [58,59]. In addition, in
closer relationships such as friendships, individuals often
experience hurt feelings, including feelings of personal
disappointment or betrayal [60]. The social disappointment
hypothesis argues that chimpanzees’ reactions to receiving
the less-preferred food express discontent about receiving
worse treatment than one could receive. Future studies
should further examine the nature of chimpanzees’ emotional
responses to being treated without concern, and, for example,
study chimpanzees’ facial expressions when refusing the
less-preferred food. Another interesting question relates to
chimpanzees’ expectations towards their friends [53–55]: do
chimpanzees react more strongly when a close conspecific
friend fails to take their well-being into consideration than
when a neutral individual does?
In the current study, chimpanzees clearly differentiated
between a human distributor and a machine distributor in
terms of their refusals to exchange, but not regarding their
selection of the opt-out apparatus. By choosing the opt-out
apparatus, chimpanzees could protest against a given distri-
bution by the experimenter or the machine without having
to give up food. As such, it provided chimpanzees with a
second way in which to express dissatisfaction with a given
distribution and is closely related to the approach used by
Sheskin et al. [29] in a study with capuchin monkeys. We
thus included the opt-out as an additional, non-costly
measure, given that refusal to exchange is a costly behaviour
in that it requires chimpanzees to forgo food that they other-
wise like to eat
(see food preference test during the
familiarization phase). However, as the results indicate, chim-
panzees actually showed the costly behaviour and gave up
access to food by refusing to exchange their tool in the
human conditions at a relatively high rate; in fact, the
observed average rate in the human conditions is nearly iden-
tical to the one observed in previous studies on chimpanzees’
behaviour in the inequity aversion task (see Brosnan et al.’s
inequity test condition [24]). Chimpanzees not only showed
more refusals to exchange in the human conditions compared
with machine conditions but also particularly high refusal
rates when their partner was absent and food was distributed
by a human. One potential explanation for this behaviour is
that seeing a conspecific consume food elicits food compe-
tition [61]. This competition in turn might weaken subjects’
inhibitory control, an ability that is necessary in refusing to
exchange the tool for food. In any case, the fact that chimpan-
zees were most likely to refuse food in the human/no partner
condition does not challenge the social disappointment
hypothesis, but rather the social comparison hypothesis.
Very few previous empirical and theoretical studies have
stressed the role of the experimenter in the inequity aversion
paradigm [57,62]. Van Schaik [62, p. 328], for example, writes
that ‘The monkey in the token-exchange experiment can be
said to signal to the experimenter that this unequal treatment
is not acceptable in a social bond’. However, all previous
work has accepted the claim that individuals in the inequity
aversion task respond to how they are treated compared to
how another individual is treated, i.e. that their response is
based on social comparison. Here, instead, we have provided,
to our knowledge, the first empirical evidence that chimpan-
zees’ rejections in the inequity aversion paradigm are
grounded in social disappointment—protesting against the
experimenter for treating them worse than she could have
treated them—and not in social comparison—what they are
getting in comparison with what a conspecific partner is get-
ting.
Using
Roughley’s
terminology
[49],
chimpanzees’
behaviour in the inequity aversion task is thus best explained

 in terms of dyadic rather than triadic sociality. Nevertheless,
reacting negatively to being treated without concern, thereby
acting on social expectations of social agents, represents an
important and necessary step on the way to a full-fledged
moral sense and a concomitant aversion to inequity.
