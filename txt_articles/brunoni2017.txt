BACKGROUND
We compared transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) with a selective sero-
tonin-reuptake inhibitor for the treatment of depression.
METHODS
In a single-center, double-blind, noninferiority trial involving adults with unipolar 
depression, we randomly assigned patients to receive tDCS plus oral placebo, sham 
tDCS plus escitalopram, or sham tDCS plus oral placebo. The tDCS was adminis-
tered in 30-minute, 2-mA prefrontal stimulation sessions for 15 consecutive week-
days, followed by 7 weekly treatments. Escitalopram was given at a dose of 10 mg 
per day for 3 weeks and 20 mg per day thereafter. The primary outcome measure 
was the change in the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) score 
(range, 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more depression). Noninferiority of 
tDCS versus escitalopram was defined by a lower boundary of the confidence in-
terval for the difference in the decreased score that was at least 50% of the differ-
ence in the scores with placebo versus escitalopram.
RESULTS
A total of 245 patients underwent randomization, with 91 being assigned to esci-
talopram, 94 to tDCS, and 60 to placebo. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the mean 
(±SD) decrease in the score from baseline was 11.3±6.5 points in the escitalopram 
group, 9.0±7.1 points in the tDCS group, and 5.8±7.9 points in the placebo group. 
The lower boundary of the confidence interval for the difference in the decrease 
for tDCS versus escitalopram (difference, −2.3 points; 95% confidence interval 
[CI], −4.3 to −0.4; P 
= 
0.69) was lower than the noninferiority margin of −2.75 (50% 
of placebo minus escitalopram), so noninferiority could not be claimed. Escitalo-
pram and tDCS were both superior to placebo (difference vs. placebo, 5.5 points 
[95% CI, 3.1 to 7.8; P<0.001] and 3.2 points [95% CI, 0.7 to 5.5; P 
= 
0.01], respec-
tively). Patients receiving tDCS had higher rates of skin redness, tinnitus, and 
nervousness than did those in the other two groups, and new-onset mania devel-
oped in 2 patients in the tDCS group. Patients receiving escitalopram had more 
frequent sleepiness and obstipation than did those in the other two groups.
CONCLUSIONS
In a single-center trial, tDCS for the treatment of depression did not show non-
inferiority to escitalopram over a 10-week period and was associated with more 
adverse events. (Funded by Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São 
Paulo and others; ELECT-TDCS ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01894815.)

M
ajor depressive disorder is a high-
ly prevalent condition.1 There is interest 
in the effectiveness and safety of new 
and nonpharmacologic treatments for depression. 
In 2009, transcranial magnetic stimulation was 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration 
for the treatment of major depressive disorder.2 
The procedure has had mixed results in various 
trials,3 is associated with a small risk of seizure,4 
and is costly.
Transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) 
is a noninvasive brain-stimulation technique that 
is less costly than transcranial magnetic stimula-
tion and has not been associated with seizures.5 
In this procedure, weak, direct current is applied 
through electrodes that are placed on the scalp 
to induce alterations in cortical activity and excit-
ability.6 In patients with major depressive disor-
der, tDCS-induced currents are applied to the 
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is consid-
ered to be a target for mood regulation.7
We previously conducted a trial involving pa-
tients with major depressive disorder,8 which 
showed the superiority of tDCS plus sertraline 
over tDCS only, sertraline only, and placebo. 
However, that trial was not designed to compare 
tDCS with pharmacotherapy directly. Further-
more, small, placebo-controlled clinical trials 
testing the efficacy of tDCS in patients with 
major depressive disorder have shown inconsis-
tent results.9
On the basis of the safety of tDCS that has 
been observed in previous studies, and given the 
possibility that tDCS would be more acceptable 
to patients than antidepressants, we conducted a 
noninferiority trial, the Escitalopram versus Elec-
trical Current Therapy for Treating Depression 
Clinical Study (ELECT-TDCS), to compare the 
efficacy of tDCS with that of the selective sero-
tonin-reuptake inhibitor escitalopram in patients 
with major depressive disorder. The null hypoth-
esis was that the decrease in the score (indicat-
ing less depression) on a conventional rating 
scale of depression in the tDCS group would be 
50% or less of the difference in the decreased 
scores between the escitalopram group and the 
placebo group; that is, noninferiority would be 
established if tDCS, as compared with escitalo-
pram, was associated with at least 50% of the 
superiority of escitalopram over placebo. As sec-
ondary aims, we investigated biomarkers that are 
associated with clinical depression outcomes. 
We also investigated the effects of tDCS versus 
placebo and tDCS versus escitalopram over time 
and assessed the adverse effects and safety of 
both tDCS and escitalopram.
Methods
Trial Design
The trial design has been published previously.10 
The trial was conducted at the University Hospi-
tal and Department and Institute of Psychiatry, 
University of São Paulo, with a recruitment pe-
riod from October 2013 through July 2016. The 
trial was approved by the local ethics committee. 
All the patients provided written informed con-
sent. All the authors affirm that the trial was 
conducted, and all analyses were performed, per 
the original protocol, which is available with the 
full text of this article at NEJM.org. The authors 
vouch for the accuracy and completeness of the 
data and analyses reported.
Soterix Medical provided five tDCS devices 
(1×1 tDCS-CT) free of charge, and Libbs provided 
escitalopram oxalate (Reconter, 10-mg pills) free 
of charge. These companies were not involved in 
any aspect of the conduct, analysis, or reporting 
of the trial. The funder, Fundação de Amparo à 
Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo, had no role in 
any aspect of the trial.
In this noninferiority, parallel, placebo-con-
trolled trial, patients were randomly assigned in 
a 2:3:3 ratio, with the use of a permuted-block 
design, according to a computer-generated list, 
to receive one of three regimens: sham tDCS plus 
placebo (placebo group), sham tDCS plus escital-
opram (escitalopram group), and active tDCS 
plus placebo (tDCS group).
Patients
We included patients 18 to 75 years of age who 
had unipolar depression that had been diagnosed 
according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), criteria and 
confirmed by psychiatrists by means of the Mini-
International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).11 
Patients had to have a score of 17 points or more 
on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 
(HDRS-17; scores range from 0 to 52, with higher 
scores indicating more depression; a score of 
24 or more indicates severe depression; minimal

clinically significant difference, 3 points) as well 
as a low risk of suicide (evaluated with the use 
of the MINI). The exclusion criteria were bipolar 
disorder, substance abuse or dependence, demen-
tia, personality disorder, brain injury, pregnancy, 
specific contraindications to tDCS (e.g., cranial 
plates), current or previous escitalopram use, and 
previous or concomitant participation in other 
trials of tDCS. Patients who presented with an 
anxiety disorder (generalized anxiety disorder, 
specific phobia, panic disorder, or social anxiety 
disorder) as a coexisting condition were not ex-
cluded.
Participants were recruited by means of ad-
vertisements and physician referrals and were 
prescreened by means of telephone and e-mail. 
Persons who met the inclusion criteria underwent 
on-site screening. Before the onset of the trial, 
the patients either were not using antidepres-
sants or underwent a drug washout and re-
mained free of antidepressant medications for 
five or more drug half-lives. Benzodiazepines 
were allowed but were tapered to a maximum 
dose of 20 mg per day of a diazepam equivalent; 
the dose remained stable during the trial.
Interventions
Anode and cathode electrodes were placed over 
the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortexes, 
respectively, with the use of the Omni-Lateral-
Electrode system.12 In a total of 22 sessions that 
lasted 30 minutes per day, 2 mA of direct-current 
stimulation were administered in each session. 
The first 15 sessions took place daily, except for 
weekends, and the remaining 7 sessions took 
place once a week, until week 10. The tDCS pro-
tocol that was used in this trial had more ses-
sions than in earlier trials because recent studies 
have suggested that more sessions could pro-
duce greater clinical effects.13,14
Trained nurses administered the tDCS regi-
men. The same protocol was used for active and 
sham tDCS, but the current was turned off auto-
matically after 30 seconds in patients receiving 
sham tDCS by devices that were programmed to 
deliver active or sham stimulation according to 
the randomized code.
Patients received 10 mg per day of escitalo-
pram (or matching placebo) for the first 3 weeks 
and 20 mg per day thereafter. The School of 
Pharmaceutical Sciences of the University of São 
Paulo produced the placebo pills. They had the 
same size, color, appearance, and taste as the 
escitalopram pills and were stored in identical 
bottles. Escitalopram was chosen as representative 
of a first-line therapy for major depressive dis-
order,15 with the maximally effective dose (20 mg 
per day) administered close to the initial dose 
(10 mg per day), which thus allowed the maxi-
mum dose to be reached within weeks after the 
initiation of the intervention if necessary.
To assess the integrity of trial-group blinding, 
patients were asked to guess which intervention 
they had received and to rate the confidence in 
their prediction. Adherence to the escitalopram 
and placebo regimens was determined by means 
of pill count and was considered to be acceptable 
if less than 10% of the pills were returned.
Outcomes
All the assessments were performed by trained 
psychiatrists and psychologists who were unaware 
of the trial-group assignments. Efficacy and 
safety were measured during screening, at base-
line, and at the end of weeks 3, 6, 8, and 10. The 
primary outcome was the change in the HDRS-
17 score from baseline to 10 weeks.
Secondary outcomes included the changes 
from baseline in the Montgomery–Åsberg De-
pression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (range, 0 to 
60, with higher scores indicating more severe 
depression; minimal clinically significant differ-
ence, 1.6 to 1.9 points),16 the Beck Depression 
Inventory score (range, 0 to 63, with higher 
scores indicating more severe depression; mini-
mal clinically significant difference, 5 points),17,18 
and several other scales that are listed in the 
protocol, the Supplementary Appendix (available 
at NEJM.org), and previous publications.19,20 Ad-
ditional secondary outcomes were early improve-
ment (defined as a change in the score from 
baseline to week 3 on the HDRS-17),21 clinical 
response (defined as a >50% reduction from the 
baseline HDRS-17 or MADRS score), and remis-
sion (defined as an HDRS-17 score ≤7 or a MADRS 
score ≤10) at week 10.
Adverse Events
Adverse events were assessed with the use of the 
Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent 
Effects questionnaire22 and a commonly used 
questionnaire regarding 39 adverse events that

have been associated with tDCS.23 At the end of 
weeks 3 and 10, patients were asked to fill out 
these questionnaires, describing the presence of 
an adverse event, its severity, and their opinion 
regarding its relationship to the trial regimen. 
We report data on all mild, moderate, and severe 
adverse events that were considered by the pa-
tients to be at least remotely associated with the 
intervention.
The Young Mania Rating Scale (range, 0 to 60, 
with higher scores indicating a greater degree of 
manic features; minimal score to define new-
onset mania or hypomania, 8 points) was used 
at the end of weeks 3 and 10 to assess mania or 
hypomania during the trial.24 Other events that 
were considered by the investigators to be poten-
tially serious adverse events were hospitalization 
for a psychiatric cause, suicidality or attempted 
suicide, or events leading to major incapacity or 
a life-threatening condition. A brief neuropsy-
chological evaluation consisting of seven tests 
(listed in the trial-design publication10 and Table 
S12 in the Supplementary Appendix) was per-
formed at baseline and at 10 weeks to determine 
whether tDCS was associated with cognitive im-
pairment.
Biologic Markers
Several biologic markers were investigated as 
predictors and mediators of clinical response. 
Two of these biologic markers have been ana-
lyzed so far: heart-rate variability and motor corti-
cal excitability (see the Supplementary Appendix). 
Other planned analyses have not yet been done.
Statistical Analysis
The sample size was estimated on the basis of 
results from our previous study, the Sertraline 
versus Electrical Current Therapy for Treating 
Depression Clinical Study (SELECT-TDCS),8 with 
the use of an attrition rate of 13%25 and a non-
inferiority margin of 50% of the comparative 
efficacy of placebo versus escitalopram. The non-
inferiority margin was based on our hypothesis 
that tDCS would be associated with at least 50% 
of the difference in efficacy of escitalopram as 
compared with placebo (see the Supplementary 
Appendix).26
For our primary hypothesis, we compared the 
decrease in the HDRS-17 score (the baseline score 
minus the score at 10 weeks, with a decrease in 
score indicating less depression) among the three 
groups. A modified t-test was used to assess 
whether the difference in the scores between the 
tDCS group and the placebo group was more 
than 50% of the mean difference between the 
scores in the escitalopram group and the place-
bo group.25 The noninferiority margin was based 
on the point estimate of 50% of the difference 
in the mean change in the HDRS-17 score in the 
comparison of placebo with escitalopram. This 
approach was chosen because our hypothesis was 
that tDCS would be associated with at least 50% 
of the effectiveness of escitalopram. If the lower 
boundary of the confidence interval around the 
mean difference between the scores in the tDCS 
group versus the escitalopram group exceeded 
this value, then noninferiority could be claimed 
(see the statistical analysis plan provided with 
the protocol). After the noninferiority assess-
ment, t-tests were used for superiority analyses, 
comparing the decrease in the HDRS-17 score 
for escitalopram versus tDCS, for escitalopram 
versus placebo, and for tDCS versus placebo.
A mixed-model analysis of variance was con-
ducted to assess a reduction in symptoms over 
time. Logistic regression was performed to as-
sess the rates of response and remission between 
groups. The chi-square test or Fisher’s exact test 
was used to compare the frequency and severity 
of adverse events, new-onset mania or hypoma-
nia, and serious adverse events between groups. 
The number of adverse events between groups at 
10 weeks was compared with the use of the 
Kruskal–Wallis test. General linear models were 
used to assess predictors of response. These ex-
ploratory analyses were not corrected for multi-
ple comparisons (see the protocol).
For biomarker analyses, 78 analyses were per-
formed, and 3 or 4 positive results were expected 
by chance (see the Supplementary Appendix). For 
the clinical, demographic, neuropsychological, 
psychological,27 and adverse-event analyses, 4 or 
5 positive results were expected by chance, be-
cause 85 analyses were performed.
We performed noninferiority analyses in the 
intention-to-treat and per-protocol populations.28 
Analysis was also performed in the population of 
patients who had high adherence to the trial visits 
(patients who had <2 missing visits). Missing data 
were considered to be missing at random and 
were imputed with the use of regression models, 
in which baseline depression and main demo-
graphic characteristics were used as variables.

Electrical Direct-Current Therapy vs. Escitalopram
Results
Patients
Of 1479 patients screened, 245 were enrolled and 
underwent randomization. A total of 60 patients 
were assigned to receive placebo, 91 to receive 
escitalopram, and 94 to receive tDCS. Of these 
245 patients, 202 received all 22 planned ses-
sions of actual or sham tDCS and completed the 
week-10 assessment (55 patients in the placebo 
group, 75 in the escitalopram group, and 72 in 
the tDCS group) (Fig. S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Withdrawal rates did not differ sig-
nificantly among the three groups (χ2 
= 
4.77, 
P 
= 
0.09). The reasons for withdrawal are de-
scribed in Table S1 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix. The characteristics of the patients are 
described in Table 1, and in Tables S2, S12, and 
S14 in the Supplementary Appendix.
Primary Outcome
As compared with baseline, the mean depression 
scores, as measured by the HDRS-17, decreased 
(with greater decreases indicating less depres-
sion) by 11.3±6.5 points in the escitalopram

by 5.8±7.9 points in the placebo group. The mean 
difference between the placebo group and the 
escitalopram group (i.e., placebo minus escital-
opram) was −5.5 points (indicating a greater 
decrease in the escitalopram group), and the 
difference between the tDCS group and the esci-
talopram group was −2.3 points (95% confidence 
interval [CI], −4.3 to −0.4). The noninferiority of 
tDCS to escitalopram could therefore not be 
claimed, because the lower boundary of the con-
fidence interval (−4.3) was lower than the pre-
specified noninferiority margin of 50% of the 
difference between the placebo group and the 
escitalopram group (−2.75; P 
= 
0.69 by the modi-
fied t-test for noninferiority) (Table 2 and Fig. 1).
Superiority Analyses
Escitalopram was superior to placebo (difference 
in mean scores, 5.5 points; 95% CI, 3.1 to 7.8; 
P<0.001), as was tDCS (difference, 3.2 points; 
95% CI, 0.7 to 5.5; P 
= 
0.01). Similarly, in the per-
protocol analyses, escitalopram was superior to 
placebo (difference, 5.6 points; 95% CI, 3 to 8.3; 
P<0.001) and to tDCS (difference, 2.9 points; 
95% CI, 0.5 to 5.2; P 
= 
0.02). We also found that 
tDCS was superior to placebo (difference, 2.5 
points; 95% CI, 0.1 to 5.0; P 
= 
0.048).
Among the 122 patients who had high adher-
ence to the trial visits (31 patients in the placebo 
group, 47 in the escitalopram group, and 44 in 
the tDCS group), escitalopram was superior to 
placebo (difference in mean scores, 5.0 points; 
95% CI, 1.8 to 8.1; P<0.001). Treatment with 
tDCS was also superior to placebo (difference, 
4.1 points; 95% CI, 0.9 to 7.3; P 
= 
0.01), and the 
efficacies of tDCS and escitalopram did not dif-
fer significantly (difference, −0.9 points; 95% CI, 
−3.7 to 1.9; P 
= 
0.53).
Other Secondary Outcomes
There was a significant time-by-group interaction 
across weeks 0, 3, 6, 8, and 10 with regard to the 
HDRS-17 score (P<0.01 for all comparisons). 
Pairwise comparisons between the trial groups 
at week 10 corroborated the primary-outcome 
findings. Escitalopram was superior to placebo 
at all time points after baseline, whereas tDCS 
was superior to placebo only at weeks 8 and 10 
(Fig. 2, and Table S3 in the Supplementary Ap-
pendix).
The results regarding changes from baseline 
in the other scales were similar to those for 
HDRS-17, except for the Beck Depression Inven-
tory score, for which tDCS was not superior to 
placebo (Table 2, and Tables S4 through S7 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). At week 10, the 
rates of response (defined as a >50% reduction 
in the baseline HDRS-17 or MADRS score) with 
tDCS and with escitalopram were significantly 
superior to the response rate with placebo, but 
the remission rates did not differ significantly 
between groups (Table 2, and Tables S8 and S9 
in the Supplementary Appendix).
Neuropsychological assessments showed either 
an improvement in cognitive performance or no 
changes in performance from baseline to 10 weeks 
in each of the three trial groups (Table S12 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The Montreal Cog-
nitive Assessment and Trail Making Tests A and 
B showed significant improvement in all three 
groups, whereas verbal fluency improved in only 
the two active-treatment groups.
Adverse Events and Safety
There were no significant differences among the 
groups in the overall frequency and intensity of 
adverse events (Table 3, and Tables S10 and S11 
in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients who 
received tDCS had significantly more itching, 
tingling, skin redness, and burning sensation at 
the skin sites under the electrodes, as well as 
tinnitus and nervousness, than did those in the 
other two groups. Sleepiness and obstipation 
were significantly more frequent with escitalo-
pram than with tDCS.
Two patients, both of whom received tDCS, 
had new-onset mania during the conduct of the 
trial. One patient had a Young Mania Rating 
Scale score of 11 at week 3 and a score of 3 at 
week 10, and the other had scores of 22 and 11 
at these respective time points. These episodes 
did not result in hospitalization, discontinuation 
from the trial, or specific treatment. These two 
patients were followed for 6 months after the 
trial and did not present with further manic or 
hypomanic symptoms.
Subgroup Analyses
In post hoc analyses, significant interactions were 
found between the assigned group and smoking 
status (nonsmokers had a greater decrease in the 
HDRS-17 score than smokers in the analysis of 
tDCS vs. placebo), self-directedness (patients with 
higher scores had a greater decrease in the HDRS-

Plus–minus values are means ±SD. Change in the score was calculated as the score at baseline minus the score at 10 weeks, with greater decreases indicating less depression. 
Between-group differences are shown for the outcomes regarding decreases in scores from baseline to week 10, and odds ratios are shown for the outcomes regarding response and re-
mission. Scores on the HDRS-17 range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more depression; a score of 24 or more indicates severe depression (minimal clinically significant dif-
ference, 3 points). Scores on the MADRS range from 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression (minimal clinically significant difference, 1.6 to 1.9 points). Response 
was defined as a decrease in the score (indicating less depression) of 50% or more from baseline to week 10. Remission was defined as a score of 7 or fewer points on the HDRS-17 or 
as 10 or fewer points on the MADRS at 10 weeks. Results for the primary-outcome scale were obtained with the use of t-tests and for the secondary outcomes with the use of mixed-
model analyses of variance and logistic regressions.

17 score in the escitalopram group or the tDCS 
group than did those with lower scores), and 
cooperativeness (higher scores were associated 
with a greater decrease in the placebo group 
than were lower scores) (Tables S13, S15, S16, 
and S17 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Biologic Markers
Increased cortical inhibition in tests of motor-
cortex excitability was associated with lower de-
grees of decrease in the HDRS-17 scores in the 
escitalopram group and the tDCS group. No 
associations between heart-rate variability at 
baseline and a decrease in the HDRS-17 score 
were found. However, increased heart-rate vari-
ability was associated with the degree of de-
crease in the HDRS-17 score, regardless of the 
trial group (see the Supplementary Appendix).
Integrity of Blinding
Patients correctly guessed their trial-group as-
signment to escitalopram but not to active tDCS. 
The unblinding with regard to escitalopram ap-
peared to be associated with adverse events 
(Table S18 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Discussion
In this three-group trial involving patients with 
major depressive disorder, tDCS did not show 
noninferiority to escitalopram in the intention-
to-treat and per-protocol analyses in reducing 
depression. In secondary-outcome superiority 
analyses, escitalopram was superior to tDCS and 
placebo, and tDCS was superior to placebo.
Two patients receiving tDCS had mania that 
began during the trial, and tDCS was associated 
with higher rates of local adverse events than 
escitalopram. These adverse events included skin 
redness and tingling and nervousness and tinni-
tus. All these adverse events had been previously 
reported in trials of tDCS.29,30 Escitalopram was 
associated with higher rates of sleepiness and 
obstipation than was tDCS or placebo. The total 
number of adverse events was similar among the 
three groups. There were no cases of suicide, 
psychiatric hospitalization, or other serious ad-
verse events during the trial.
The inclusion of a placebo group is a strength 
of this trial design because it allowed an estimate 
of the relative efficacies of escitalopram and 
tDCS, as compared with placebo, and allowed 
for the calculation of a noninferiority margin. 
Figure 1. Comparative Efficacy of the Trial Groups.
Shown are the results of the intention-to-treat analysis of the differences in 
the decreased scores (defined as the baseline score minus the score at 10 
weeks, with a greater decrease indicating less depression) between escital-
opram and placebo, escitalopram and transcranial direct-current stimula-
tion (tDCS), and tDCS and placebo. The x axis represents the difference in 
the scores on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17). 
Scores range from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more depression, 
and a score of 24 or more indicates severe depression; the minimal clinically 
significant difference is 3 points. The dashed line at δ indicates the non-
inferiority margin, which was defined as 50% of the difference in the de-
creased scores between the escitalopram group and the placebo group 
(2.75, green line). The lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval (error 
bars) for the difference in decrease between the scores in the tDCS group 
and the escitalopram group (4.3, red line) was lower than the noninferiority 
margin of 2.75, so noninferiority could not be claimed.

Shown are the mean scores (intention-to-treat analysis) in the trial groups 
from baseline to 10 weeks. I bars represent ±1 SD. HDRS-17 scores range 
from 0 to 52, with higher scores indicating more depression, and a score  
of 24 or more indicates severe depression; the minimal clinically significant 
difference is 3 points. Treatment with escitalopram was superior to placebo 
at all time points except baseline (P = 0.008 for the comparison at week 3, 
P = 0.01 at week 6, and P<0.001 at weeks 8 and 10). Treatment with tDCS 
was superior to placebo at weeks 8 and 10 (P<0.001 for both comparisons). 
Treatment with escitalopram was superior to tDCS at weeks 3 (P<0.001) 
and 10 (P = 0.004).

Electrical Direct-Current Therapy vs. Escitalopram
Furthermore, the sample was not biased by the 
inclusion of patients who had treatment resis-
tance to escitalopram. Patients in the trial had 
moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms, and 
there was a high prevalence of coexisting anxiety 
disorder, a combination that reflects a typical 
clinical population in which treatment for de-
pression is indicated.31
Trial limitations include the lack of widely 
used or standardized tDCS treatment variables, 
such as amperage and duration of application of 
direct current, and the unblinding of escitalo-
pram owing to its side-effect profile. Despite 
local skin reactions, patients did not correctly 
guess assignment to tDCS. The results obtained 
in this trial with escitalopram may not be gen-
eralizable to other antidepressant medications 
or to different tDCS protocols.
Because the sample size was based on continu-
ous outcomes, the analyses of the categorical 
outcomes might have been underpowered. None-
theless, tDCS was superior to placebo with re-
gard to response rates, as measured by a 50% 
reduction from baseline in the HDRS-17 or 
MADRS score, a finding that is similar to previ-
ous results.8,13 However, tDCS was not superior 
to placebo with regard to rates of remission. 
Furthermore, the rates of response and remis-
sion did not differ significantly between the tDCS 
group and the escitalopram group.
Secondary analyses revealed that tDCS was 
superior to placebo only at week 10 (the trial end 
point for the primary outcome) but not at week 3. 
Previous studies have also shown that the effects 
of tDCS are evident only several weeks after the 
initial 10 to 15 sessions.8,9,13,32
Although we used a protocol with a greater 
number of tDCS sessions than has been used in 
previous trials, the rates of clinical improvement 
were similar to those that have been observed in 
previous studies.8,33 Future studies of tDCS could 
investigate different total doses of electrical 
stimulation in patients with major depressive 
disorder.

An adverse event was present if participants described it as being at least remotely associated with the intervention. 
Participants rated the severity (i.e., mild, moderate, or severe) of the adverse events. New-onset mania or hypomania 
was diagnosed if the participant presented with a score of 8 or more on the Young Mania Rating Scale (range, 0 to 60, 
with higher scores indicating a greater degree of manic features) when assessed at any point during the trial. P values 
represent the result of the chi-square or the Fisher’s exact test comparing the frequency of adverse events between pla-
cebo and tDCS or between escitalopram and tDCS. No significant between-group differences were observed. Analyses 
were performed in patients who completed the trial.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
In conclusion, tDCS did not show noninferi-
ority to escitalopram in this placebo-controlled 
trial involving patients with unipolar major de-
pressive disorder. Although tDCS was superior 
to placebo in some secondary outcomes, it was 
associated with more adverse events, including 
new-onset mania.
