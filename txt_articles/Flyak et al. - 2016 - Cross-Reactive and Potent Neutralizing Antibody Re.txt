In Brief
Natural Ebola virus infection causes the
induction of B cells that encode potent
neutralizing human antibodies, which
possess, in some cases, a surprising level
of cross-reactivity for multiple species of
filoviruses. The neutralizing antibody
repertoire recognizes diverse features on
the surface glycoprotein, but most of the
potent antibodies recognize the glycan
cap region.

SUMMARY
Recent studies have suggested that antibody-medi-
ated protection against the Ebolaviruses may be
achievable, but little is known about whether or not
antibodies can
confer cross-reactive
protection
against viruses belonging to diverse Ebolavirus
species, such as Ebola virus (EBOV), Sudan virus
(SUDV), and Bundibugyo virus (BDBV). We isolated
a large panel of human monoclonal antibodies
(mAbs) against BDBV glycoprotein (GP) using pe-
ripheral blood B cells from survivors of the 2007
BDBV outbreak in Uganda. We determined that a
large proportion of mAbs with potent neutralizing ac-
tivity against BDBV bind to the glycan cap and recog-
nize diverse epitopes within this major antigenic site.
We identified several glycan cap-specific mAbs that
neutralized multiple ebolaviruses, including SUDV,
and a cross-reactive mAb that completely protected
guinea pigs from the lethal challenge with heterolo-
gous EBOV. Our results provide a roadmap to
develop a single antibody-based treatment effective
against multiple Ebolavirus infections.
INTRODUCTION
The genus Ebolavirus, family Filoviridae, contains three viral spe-
cies that are known to cause large deadly disease outbreaks in
Africa: Zaire ebolavirus represented by Ebola virus (EBOV),
Sudan ebolavirus represented by Sudan virus (SUDV), and Bun-
dibugyo ebolavirus represented by Bundibugyo virus (BDBV).
The most recent EBOV outbreak has caused more than 28,000
cases and more than 11,000 deaths (according to the October
14, 2015, World Health Organization [WHO] Ebola Situation
Report). While there is no FDA-approved treatment for filovirus
infections, several experimental therapeutics against EBOV are
being investigated, including small interfering RNAs (Geisbert
et al., 2010; Thi et al., 2015), antisense oligonucleotides (Warren
et al., 2010, 2015), a nucleoside analog (Warren et al., 2014),
therapeutic vaccines (Feldmann et al., 2007; Geisbert et al.,
2008), and monoclonal antibody (mAb) cocktails (Olinger et al.,
2012; Qiu et al., 2012, 2014). Of these, preliminary treatment
studies suggest that the effect of the ZMapp mAb cocktail ex-
ceeded the efficacy and treatment window of other experimental
therapeutics described so far (Qiu et al., 2014).
The ZMapp cocktail is composed of three EBOV glycoprotein
(GP)-specific mAbs (designated c13C6, c2G4, and c4G7) that
were isolated initially from mice (Qiu et al., 2011; Wilson et al.,
2000), chimerized with human antibody-constant regions, and
then produced in Nicotiana benthamiana (Qiu et al., 2014). Sin-
gle-particle electron microscopy (EM) reconstructions of these
mAbs in complex with EBOV surface protein have revealed key
sites of vulnerability on the EBOV GP (Murin et al., 2014). One
such site lies within the GP base at the GP1/GP2 interface; two
of three mAbs from the ZMapp cocktail (c2G4 and c4G7) bind
to overlapping epitopes located in this region. The third mAb
from the ZMapp cocktail, c13C6, binds a second antigenic
site, which is located in the glycan cap region. GP base region-
specific mAbs c2G4 and c4G7 displayed high neutralization ac-
tivity in vitro (IC50 < 0.1 mg/ml), whereas the glycan cap-specific
mAb c13C6 weakly neutralized EBOV only in the presence of
complement (IC50 > 1.0 mg/ml) (Qiu et al., 2014). The lower

 in vitro neutralization activity of glycan cap-specific antibodies
may be due to the removal of the glycan cap by host proteases
(Chandran et al., 2005; Co
ˆ te
´ et al., 2011; Misasi et al., 2012) in-
side the endosome before GP engagement with the Niemann-
Pick C1 receptor (Carette et al., 2011; Co
ˆ te
´ et al., 2011).
The ability of mAbs to bind to conserved neutralizing epitopes
present on the surface of highly variable viral proteins has been
documented extensively for HIV (Burton et al., 2012), influenza
viruses (Pappas et al., 2014), dengue virus (Rouvinski et al.,
2015), paramyxoviruses (Corti et al., 2013), and alphaviruses
(Fox et al., 2015). Despite similar requirements for virus entry
into the cell (Misasi et al., 2012), GPs from BDBV, EBOV, and
SUDV strains differ by over 30% at the amino acid level (Towner
et al., 2008). This overall genetic divergence among species of
genus Ebolavirus has hampered the development of ebolavirus
cross-neutralizing Abs. The key components of multiple anti-
body cocktails developed over the last decade neutralize only
viruses of species Zaire ebolavirus. A weakly neutralizing mAb
c13C6 was shown to cross-react with SUDV GPs (Wilson
et al., 2000), but it is unknown whether this mAb can neutralize
SUDV. Recently, several studies have shown that cross-reactive
antibodies in serum can be elicited during natural infection in hu-
mans or vaccination of animals. The serum of individuals who
survived BDBV, EBOV, or SUDV infections contained ebolavirus
cross-reactive IgG, but not IgM (Macneil et al., 2011). Other
studies demonstrated that mice immunized with a vaccine
bearing the GP of EBOV generated cross-reactive polyclonal
mAbs to other ebolaviruses, such as BDBV and SUDV (Meyer
et al., 2015; Ou et al., 2012). Four broadly reactive non-neutral-
izing mAbs were isolated in mice after vaccinating animals with
recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) expressing EBOV
GP and then boosting initial immune response with the heterolo-
gous virus containing SUDV GP (Hernandez et al., 2015). The
epitopes recognized by such cross-reactive mAbs are unknown.
In this study, we isolated a large panel of BDBV-specific and
ebolavirus cross-reactive mAbs from B cells of survivors of
BDBV infection. The results show that a large proportion of
mAbs with potent neutralizing activity against BDBV bind to the
glycan cap and recognize diverse epitopes within this major anti-
genic site. We identified several glycan cap-specific mAbs that
neutralized multiple Ebolavirus species and a cross-reactive
mAb that completely protected guinea pigs from the lethal chal-
lenge with heterologous EBOV when used as monotherapy.
Several of these naturally occurring antibodies exhibit the most
potent protective capacity reported, and they possessed unprec-
edented cross-reactivity for multiple Ebolavirus species, including
SUDV,forwhichneutralizinghumanmAbshavenotbeenreported.
RESULTS
Isolation of Human mAbs
To generate human cell lines secreting human mAbs to BDBV,
we transformed peripheral blood B cells from seven survivors
of the 2007 Uganda BDBV outbreak with Epstein-Barr virus, as
described in the Experimental Procedures. To determine the
breadth of antibody response in survivors of ebolavirus infection,
we screened supernatants from EBV-transformed B cell lines for
binding to GPs from diverse representatives of filovirus species:
BDBV, EBOV, or Marburg virus (MARV) (Figures 1A and S1). We
also used the same GP panel to screen supernatants from trans-
formed B cell lines derived from a survivor of the 2014 EBOV
outbreak (Figure 1B) or from a donor who survived MARV infec-
tion (Figure 1C). We color coded GP-reactive supernatants
based on the cross-reactivity pattern as follows: species-spe-
cific cell lines are highlighted in black; and cross-reactive lines
to two or three species are shown in yellow or blue, respectively
(Figures 1A–1C and S1).
While approximately half of GP-specific B cell lines obtained
from BDBV survivors produced antibodies specific to BDBV
GP, 24%–50% of GP-reactive B cell culture supernatants also
cross-reacted with EBOV GP (Figures 1A and 1D). Similarly,
36% of GP-specific B cell lines obtained from the EBOV survivor
cross-reacted with the heterologous BDBV GP (Figures 1B and
1D). Despite the apparent presence of B cells encoding cross-
reactive antibodies in survivors of BDBV or EBOV infections to
GPs from heterologous Ebolavirus species, we detected a very
limited cross-reactivity with GPs from MARV, which belongs to
a different genus in the family Filoviridae (Figures 1A and 1D).
In line with this finding, 90% of GP-reactive B cell lines obtained
from the MARV survivor reacted with autologous GP, and only
2% of antigen-specific B cell lines produced Ebolavirus cross-
reactive Abs (Figures 1C and 1D). The limited cross-reactivity
of mAbs to GPs from Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus species likely
is due in part to low sequence conservation between GPs from
two genera (only 27% amino acid identity between BDBV and
MARV GP) as well as differences in epitope availability caused
by different positions of the mucin-like domains on the GP sur-
face of Ebolavirus and Marburgvirus (Flyak et al., 2015; Fusco
et al., 2015; Hashiguchi et al., 2015).
Binding and Neutralizing Activity of Human mAbs
We fused transformed cells from B cell lines producing BDBV
GP-reactive Abs with myeloma cells and generated 90 cloned
hybridomas secreting BDBV GP-reactive human mAbs. To
determine the breadth of mAb binding, we screened the mAbs
Figure 1. Cross-Reactive B Cell Responses in Filovirus Immune Donors
(A–C) Supernatants from EBV-transformed PBMC samples isolated from survivors were screened in ELISA-binding assays using BDBV, EBOV, or MARV GPs.
Results for four BDBV survivors (A), one EBOV survivor (B), and one MARV survivor (C) are shown. Height of the bars indicates OD405 nm values in ELISA binding to
full-length extracellular domain of GP of the indicated virus species. Reactive supernates are color coded based on the cross-reactivity pattern as follows:
species-specific cell lines are highlighted in black; and cross-reactive lines to two or three species are shown in yellow or blue, respectively. Previous work has
shown that the amino acid sequence of GP differs between BDBV and EBOV by over 34% and between BDBV and MARV by over 72%.
(D) Percentages of lines secreting antibodies specific to BDBV, EBOV, or MARV GPs or cross-reactive antibodies to BDBV and EBOV (designated BDBV/EBOV)
or BDBV, EBOV, and MARV (designated BDBV/EBOV/MARV) are shown. Increasing intensity of the pink cell fill color corresponds to increasing reactivity for the
indicated virus.

 in ELISA-binding assays using recombinant GPs from multiple
filoviruses: BDBV, EBOV, SUDV, or MARV GPs. While 33 Abs
recognized only the autologous BDBV GP (designated groups
1A and 1B), 20 Abs recognized both BDBV and EBOV GPs
(groups 2A and 2B), and 37 Abs recognized all three GPs from
BDBV, EBOV, and SUDV (groups 3A and 3B) (Figures 2A and
2C; Data S1). The relative proportions of antibodies that recog-
nize GPs from 1, 2, or 3 Ebolavirus species did not correlate fully
with the B cell line frequencies in the initial screen, which can be
explained by our prioritization on recovery of a high number of
cross-reactive mAbs. We were not able to isolate Abs that bind
to the heterologous MARV GP (Figures 2A and 2C; Data S1).
We further characterized the binding of species-specific or
cross-reactive mAbs to recombinant GPs by performing a bind-
ing assay with the recombinant form of GP that is secreted from
the cell to the extracellular space during natural infection (sGP,
secreted GP) (Sanchez et al., 1996; Volchkov et al., 1995). While
the Ebolavirus GP is a trimer, sGP forms dimers in which each
protomer shares only the amino-terminal 295 amino acids with
GP. The majority of mAbs recognized epitopes shared between
BDBV GP and BDBV sGP (designated groups 1A, 2A, or 3A) (Fig-
ures 2A and 2C). We also identified antibodies that bound to
BDBV GP, but failed to bind BDBV sGP in ELISA (designated
groups 1B, 2B, or 3B) (Figures 2A and 2C). Antibodies from
groups 1B, 2B, or 3B also bound the recombinant GP form
that lacks highly glycosylated mucin-like domains (BDBV
GPDmuc), suggesting that mAbs from these three groups target
epitopes outside of mucin-like domains (Figure S2).
To evaluate the inhibitory activity of isolated mAbs, we tested
mAbs in a BDBV neutralization assay. Of the 90 BDBV GP-reac-
tive mAbs, 31 had half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
values <10 mg/ml, and we defined these as neutralizing anti-
bodies (nAbs) (Figures 2B, where nAb names are highlighted in
red, and S3). Several nAbs displayed an extremely high neutral-
izing potency, with IC50 values below 1 ng/ml (Figure 2B). Also,
18 of 31 nAbs bound only to BDBV GP in ELISA, six nAbs recog-
nized BDBV and EBOV GPs, and the remaining seven nAbs
bound to GPs from representatives of three Ebolavirus species,
BDBV, EBOV, and SUDV. These results suggested that cross-
reactive mAbs in our panel might possess neutralizing activity
to multiple ebolaviruses. To test this hypothesis, we screened
BDBV425 (a group 2A nAb) in an EBOV neutralization assay as
the nAb with the lowest half-maximal effective concentration
(EC50) value to the heterologous EBOV GP, and we determined
that BDBV425 neutralized the heterologous EBOV. Encouraged
by this result, we tested nAbs from groups 3A and 3B in EBOV or
SUDV neutralization assays to determine whether cross-reactive
nAbs can neutralize three Ebolavirus species. We found two
cross-reactive nAbs from group 3A (BDBV43 and BDBV324)
that neutralized all three ebolaviruses BDBV, EBOV, and SUDV
(Figure 2D, BDBV43). The remaining five nAbs from groups 3A
and 3B neutralized BDBV and EBOV, but failed to neutralize
SUDV (Figure 2D, BDBV289). Analysis of the Ab heavy-chain
variable domain sequences for 26 nAbs revealed that all
BDBV-specific and cross-reactive nAbs were encoded by
unique Ab genes (Table S1).
Major Antigenic Sites Recognized by Human mAbs
To determine whether Abs from distinct binding groups targeted
different antigenic regions on the BDBV GP surface, we per-
formed a quantitative competition-binding assay using a real-
time biosensor. We tested four BDBV nAbs from binding group
1A, five nAbs from binding group 1B, four nAbs from group 3A,
and three nAbs from group 3B in a tandem blocking assay, in
which BDBV GP was attached to the biosensor. We also tested
five non-neutralizing antibodies from group 1A to determine
whether non-neutralizing antibodies target a unique epitope on
GP surface. Non-neutralizing and neutralizing mAbs from group
1A and nAbs from group 3A blocked binding of each other to the
GP antigen and segregated into a single competition-binding
group (Figure 3). These results suggest that mAbs from groups
1A and 3A target a single antigenic region that contains epitopes
shared between GP and sGP (Figure 2A). The nAbs from group
3B that did not recognize sGP in ELISA (Figure 2A) segregated
into a separate competition-binding group. Group 1B antibodies
were interesting in that two nAbs in this group competed for
binding with group 3B nAbs, while three nAbs from the group
competed for binding with antibodies from group 3A (Figure 3).
These findings suggested that there are at least two major
antigenic regions recognized by human BDBV nAbs, based on
competition-binding studies. The first major antigenic region
contains epitopes that both sGP and GP share (recognized by
mAbs from groups 1A and 3A) as well as epitopes that are
present only on the GP surface (recognized by three mAbs
from group 1B). The second major antigenic region contains
only epitopes that are present on the GP surface, but not sGP
(recognized by two mAbs from group 1B and three mAbs from
group 3B).
Diverse Patterns of Molecular Recognition Defined by
Negative-Stain EM
To determine the location of the two major antigenic regions
targeted by human BDBV nAbs, we performed negative-stain
single-particle EM studies using antibodies from groups 1A
and 1B. The EM class averages and reconstructions showed
clearly that the two major antigenic regions, defined in competi-
tion-binding experiments, corresponded to two distinct sites on
the GP surface: the glycan cap and the GP base.
Comparison of the structures of glycan cap-directed mAbs
from group 1A with those in group 1B revealed that the anti-
bodies have partially overlapping epitopes, but approach the
glycan cap at distinct angles (Figures 4A, 4B, and S4). We fitted
a previously determined atomic resolution structure of SUDV
GPDmuc (Bale et al., 2012), which reveals more residues of the

 glycan cap region than the equivalent EBOV structure, into the
envelope of GP from the EM reconstructions, and we determined
the regions targeted by each mAb (Figures 4D and 4E).
BDBV335, which binds GP and sGP equally well, mainly targets
a region between residues 274 and 282. This region appears well
defined in the BDBV335 EM map, indicated by the large lobe on
the outside of the glycan cap that closely resembles that region
in the GP crystal structure. When viewed along the 3-fold axis of
GP, BDBV41 binds to the right of BDBV335, further up on the
glycan cap, close to a loop that extends from residue 266 to
277. Consistent with this position, we passaged a chimeric
VSV in which the G protein was replaced with BDBV GP as a
sole surface protein (VSV/BDBV-GP) in the presence of mAb
BDBV41 to generate a neutralization escape mutant virus that
was completely resistant to the antibody and that possessed
two amino acid substitutions, G271R and T272S (Figure S5).
The mutation at the 272 position likely explains why BDBV41 is
a group 1 antibody, i.e., only recognizes BDBV (with T272), but
not EBOV or SUDV (which have the alternate residue K272).
BDBV41 also may make contacts with a loop that extends

Data from competition-binding assays using non-neutralizing mAbs from binding group 1A (white background) and neutralizing mAbs from binding groups 1A,
1B, 3A, or 3B (pink background). Numbers indicate the percentage binding of second mAb in the presence of the first mAb compared to binding of un-competed
second mAb. MAbs were judged to compete for the same site if maximum binding of the second mAb was reduced to <30% of its un-competed binding (black
boxes with white numbers). The mAbs were considered non-competing if maximum binding of the second mAb was >70% of its un-competed binding (white
boxes with red numbers). Gray boxes with black numbers indicate an intermediate phenotype (competition resulted in between 30% and 70% of un-competed
binding). Blue, purple, and green dashed lines indicate what appear to be major competition groups; the blue and purple groups overlap substantially, but not
completely.

 toward the mucin-like domains, from residue 309 to 312 or
further in regions that were unresolved in the GP crystal struc-
ture. BDBV432 binds to the left of BDBV335, at the top of a helix
loop at residues 259–266, and likely makes extensive contacts
with a loop from residues around 302–312. Despite a lack of
binding to sGP, BDBV432, as well as BDBV353, binds in the
glycan cap region, suggesting that these mAbs make contacts
with residues that are exclusive to GP.
The other antibodies in group 1B bind to an epitope at the base
of GP. These antibodies, including BDBV255 and BDBV259,
bind further down on GP than has been observed previously
with murine mAbs, possibly contacting residues within GP2
that are part of the membrane proximal external region (MPER)
(Figures 4C–4E). These antibodies were refractory to a recon-
struction by EM due to predominant side views of the particles
and also apparent flexibility. The class averages, however,
clearly show that these antibodies bind an epitope that extends
down below the base of GP. Three Fabs can be seen in some of
the class averages, indicating that despite the apparent small
size of this region, three antibodies can be accommodated on
one GP trimer. Although the Fabs adopt various positions in
each class average, there is not a continuous range of flexibility

that bind the glycan cap of GP, but not sGP. BDBV GP or GPDmuc was used to generate complexes.

Group 1B mAbs that target the base likely bind to a loop near the membrane proximal external region (MPER) that is flexible and has not yet been resolved at high
resolution. TM, transmembrane region; CT, cytoplasmic tail.

 since the Fabs themselves are well resolved. These antibodies
may require the full MPER and transmembrane (TM) regions,
as well as a membrane, in order to bind stably. These features
are all lacking in the current recombinant protein used here, a
soluble form of the extracellular domain of GP. While the GP2 re-
gion is well conserved across the filoviruses, these BDBV-spe-
cific mAbs likely bind non-conserved regions in GP2 proximal
to the TM region.
Epitope Mapping of Group 3A mAbs Using Saturation
Mutagenesis and Negative-Stain EM
As the group 3A (cross-reactive) nAbs competed for binding with
group 1A (BDBV-specific) nAbs (Figure 3), we hypothesized that
some structural features of the glycan cap are conserved among
GPs from multiple Ebolavirus species. We sought to identify crit-
ical amino acids that defined epitopes for three group 3 nAbs
(BDBV270, BDBV289, and BDBV324) using a comprehensive
EBOV GP alanine-scanning mutation library (Davidson et al.,
2015). Epitope mapping identified critical residues for binding
by each nAb as follows: W275 for BDBV270, W275 and Y241
for BDBV289, and W275 and L273 for BDBV324. Residues for
which mutation reduced binding of three nAbs from group 3A
were visualized on the surface of the high-resolution structure
of EBOV GP (PDB: 3CSY). This finding suggests that each of
these antibodies recognizes overlapping epitopes in the GP
glycan cap (Figures 5A and 5B). The previously described murine
nAbs 2G4 and 4G7 and the human nAb KZ52 were shown previ-
ously to bind the base region of the GP (Lee et al., 2008; Murin
et al., 2014), and mutations of the W275 or L273 residue did
not reduce the binding of these nAbs (Figure 5C). We passaged
VSV/BDBV-GP in the presence of BDBV223 or BDBV289 in an
attempt to generate escape mutant viruses, but could not detect

(A and B) Epitope residues for three nAbs from group 3A (BDBV270, BDBV289, and BDBV324) were identified as those for which mutation to alanine specifically
reduced binding of these antibodies. GP residue W275 was common to all three nAbs, while L273 was specific for BDBV324 and Y241 was specific for BDBV289.

 neutralization-resistant viruses. An isolate passaged in the pres-
ence of BDBV223 with a R574H polymorphism in heptad repeat
1 (HR1) region was identified, and for BDBV289 an isolate with an
I584M polymorphism in the HR1 region alone or in combination
with an E149K substitution in the receptor-binding domain was
identified. However, none of these mutations was associated
with the ability of those viruses to resist neutralization by the cor-
responding mAb.
We further characterized BDBV289 by single-particle EM
studies of antibody in complex with GP. BDBV289 binds the
glycan cap region of GP, centered on the residues W275 and
Y241 (Figures 5D and S4). The angle of approach resembles
that of the mAb 1H3 from the antibody cocktail ZMab, although
1H3 is specific to EBOV and is weakly neutralizing (Murin et al.,
2014; Qiu et al., 2011). Further, BDBV289 also binds sGP, which
shares the first 295 amino acids of GP1 with GP, including the
glycan cap region (Sanchez et al., 1996; Volchkov et al., 1995).
Therefore, despite previous hypotheses that propose that sGP
is an immune decoy and that cleavage of the glycan cap prevents
neutralizing antibodies from binding this region (Mohan et al.,
2012; Murin et al., 2014), we have now identified several anti-
bodies that challenge these ideas. Interestingly, BDBV289 tar-
gets an overlapping epitope with antibodies that we identified
to be specific to BDBV and that do not bind sGP (Figure 4). There-
fore, the glycan cap region is a major antigenic site that contains
epitopes with subtle features that influence sGP and GP binding,
neutralization, and species cross-reactivity of targeting mAbs.
Therapeutic Efficacy of Human mAbs in Small Animal
Models of EBOV Infection
To determine the therapeutic activity of cross-neutralizing Abs,
we tested several antibodies in mice. We focused on cross-reac-
tive antibodies, and we studied the heterologous effect of BDBV
survivor mAbs against EBOV challenge. We selected two nAbs
from groups 3A (BDBV289) and 3B (BDBV223) that bound non-
overlapping antigenic regions in the competition-binding exper-
iments (Figure 3). The 7-week-old BALB/c mice received 100 mg
antibody by the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route 1 or 3 days after inoc-
ulation with 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFUs) of mouse-adapt-
ed EBOV, strain Mayinga (Bray et al., 1998). BDBV223 and
BDBV289 reduced disease and protected mice from death
when delivered 1 day after challenge with EBOV (Figure 6). We
did not observe a therapeutic effect in the mice receiving the an-
tibodies 3 days after the challenge.
Finally, we set out to test in vivo efficacy of the cross-reactive
nAbs BDBV289 and BDBV223 using a guinea pig model of EBOV
infection. The 5- to 6-week-old guinea pigs, strain Hartley, were
injected with 5 mg antibody by the i.p. route once (day 1) or twice

 (days 1 and 3) after inoculation with 1,000 PFU of guinea pig-
adapted EBOV, strain Mayinga. BDBV223 provided marginal
protection, as only one of five animals survived the lethal
challenge (Figure 7). Surprisingly, a glycan cap-specific nAb,
BDBV289, fully protected guinea pigs when delivered twice after
the virus challenge. The protective efficiency of BDBV289 with a
single treatment against a heterologous EBOV (Figure 7, three of
five animals survived) was higher than the protective efficiency
of the equivalent glycan-cap-specific mAb c13C6, a component
of the ZMapp cocktail (one of six animals survived) (Qiu et al.,
2014). To determine whether a combination of two mAbs that
target two neutralizing epitopes on the EBOV GP surface confer
better protection than treatment with a single mAb alone, we
tested the combination of BDBV223 and BDBV289 in guinea
pigs. The combination of two antibodies provided complete pro-
tection against a heterologous EBOV with only a single treatment
(Figure 7). We isolated viral RNA from blood of representative
animals that were treated with mAbs BDBV223 or BDBV289
but died, and then sequenced the genes encoding the GP
(Table S2). Several polymorphisms were detected, but none
appeared to be directly related to the epitope specificity of the
mAb used for treatment.
DISCUSSION
This study reveals that natural BDBV infection in humans triggers
the development of ebolavirus cross-reactive antibodies that
target epitopes on the GP surface that are conserved in diverse
species of genus Ebolavirus. During these studies, we isolated
90 human mAbs from humans following BDBV infection and
found 57 cross-reactive mAbs that recognized heterologous
EBOV GPs. Remarkably, some of the isolated cross-reactive
mAbs not only bound but also neutralized multiple Ebolavirus
species. The majority of cross-reactive mAbs neutralized
BDBV and EBOV, but we also isolated two antibodies that dis-
played potent neutralizing activity against representatives of
three Ebolavirus species, BDBV, EBOV, and SUDV. We tested
two cross-neutralizing mAbs in mice and guinea pigs and
showed that they protected animals from lethal challenge with
a heterologous species of EBOV. These data suggest that
cross-neutralizing mAbs can be used to develop a universal
treatment against multiple ebolaviruses, and they imply that
highly immunogenic vaccines with proper presentation of GP
from one species could induce some measure of cross-protec-
tion against viruses of the other species. The ability of these
mAbs to bind and neutralize a broad range of Ebolavirus species
also suggests that such antibodies might offer protection against
emerging filoviruses in the future.
Our study highlights the neutralization and protective po-
tencies of human glycan cap-specific antibodies. It has been
suggested previously that glycan cap-binding mAbs may not
neutralize well because cathepsins remove this region during
viral entry (Murin et al., 2014). However, several of the BDBV
glycan cap-specific mAbs isolated here exhibit very potent
neutralizing activity, and they recognize diverse epitopes
within this major antigenic site. Furthermore, a single glycan
cap-specific nAb, BDBV289, provided complete protection in
EBOV-challenged guinea pigs. The mechanism used by glycan
cap-binding mAbs to neutralize the virus in vitro is unclear. The
glycan cap-specific antibodies described here bind to sites
distant from the putative cathepsin cleavage site (located at res-
idue 190), so they are unlikely to interfere with GP cleavage.
While the amino acid sequence of the GP1 region is generally
less well conserved than that of GP2 in viruses of diverse filovirus
species, the five neutralizing glycan cap mAbs studied with EM
imaging here target conserved residues, indicating that these re-
gions may be important to the viral life cycle. Therefore, these
mAbs may block some yet undefined function of the glycan cap.
Several antibody-based treatments provided a complete spe-
cies-specific protection from EBOV in a non-human primate
model of infection (Qiu et al., 2014). However, antibody-based
therapeutics against other members of the Ebolavirus genus,
such and BDBV and SUDV, are not yet available. While one strat-
egy would be to develop separate antibody treatments for each
filovirus infection, an alternative strategy would be to have a uni-
versal treatment effective against diverse Ebolavirus species.
The development of universal antibody treatments for ebolavi-
ruses seems inevitable, given recent progress in the identifica-
tion of broad and potent neutralizing antibodies against viruses
that exhibit more antigenic diversity than the filoviruses such
as HIV (Burton et al., 2012), influenza viruses (Pappas et al.,
2014), dengue virus (Rouvinski et al., 2015), alphaviruses (Fox
et al., 2015), and paramyxoviruses (Corti et al., 2013). Our results
provide a roadmap to develop a single antibody-based treat-
ment effective against multiple Ebolavirus infections. We pro-
pose that the principal components of such treatment should
include cross-neutralizing mAbs that target conserved elements
of the non-overlapping major neutralizing antigenic sites on the
GP surface.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Donors
De-identified peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from seven survi-
vors of the 2007 BDBV outbreak in Uganda (Towner et al., 2008) were obtained
from a repository at Makerere University (Kampala, Uganda) managed in
collaboration with the U.S. Military HIV Research Program MHRP, which is
part of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. PBMCs were obtained af-
ter informed consent from a U.S. survivor of EBOV infection who was infected
while delivering health care in Liberia during the 2014 Ebola virus outbreak with
Makona virus. Cells from the EBOV survivor were obtained about 11 weeks af-
ter infection and about 7 weeks after discharge from hospital, following several
negative PCR tests for presence of virus. PBMCs were obtained from a U.S.
survivor of MARV infection who developed the disease in early 2008 following
exposure to fruit bats in the Python Cave in Queen Elizabeth National Park,
Uganda. This donor’s clinical course was documented previously (Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009), and we have reported previously
on isolation of human antibodies from this donor (Flyak et al., 2015). Peripheral
blood from the donor was obtained in 2012, 4 years after the illness, following
informed consent. The studies were approved by the Vanderbilt University
Institutional Review Board.
Viruses
BDBV strain 200706291 Uganda was isolated originally from the serum of
a patient during the first recorded outbreak caused by this virus (Towner
et al., 2008) and passaged three times in Vero E6 cells. The virus was provided
originally by the Special Pathogens Branch of the U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) and deposited at the World Reference
Center of Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses (WRCEVA), housed at the
University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB). The chimeric EBOV/BDBV-GP,

 EBOV/MARV-GP, and EBOV/SUDV-GP constructs expressing EGFP were
obtained by replacing the gene encoding EBOV GP with that of BDBV,
MARV, or SUDV, respectively (P.A. Ilinykh, unpublished data) and passaged
two times in Vero E6 cells. Additional details are reported in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Generation of Human Hybridomas Secreting mAbs
Human hybridomas were generated as described previously (Flyak et al.,
2015). In brief, previously cryopreserved samples were transformed with
Epstein-Barr virus, CpG, and additional supplements. After 7 days, cells
from each well of the 384-well culture plates were expanded into four
96-well culture plates using cell culture medium containing irradiated heter-
ologous human PBMCs (recovered from blood unit leukofiltration filters,
Nashville Red Cross) and incubated for an additional 4 days. Plates were
screened for BDBV GP antigen-specific antibody-secreting cell lines using
ELISAs. Cells from wells with supernates reacting with antigen in an ELISA
were fused with HMMA2.5 myeloma cells using an established electrofusion
technique (Yu et al., 2008).
Human mAb and Fab Production and Purification
After fusion, hybridoma cell lines were cloned by single-cell fluorescence-
activated cell sorting and expanded in post-fusion medium as previously
described (Flyak et al., 2015). HiTrap Protein G or HiTrap MabSelectSure col-
umns were used to purify antibodies from filtered supernates. Fab fragments
were generated by papain digestion, as described previously (Flyak et al.,
2015).
Expression and Purification of Filovirus GPs
BDBV GP ectodomain (BDBV GP, residues 1–637) or the sGP dimer (BDBV
sGP, residues 1–316) was used to screen supernatants of transformed B cells.
Recombinant GPs were engineered with a C-terminal double strep tag and
cloned into a modified pMTpuro vector for expression in Drosophila S2 cells.
Briefly, plasmids were transfected into S2 cells using Effectene reagent
(QIAGEN) followed by stable cell selection with 6 mg/ml puromycin. S2 cells
first were cultured in Schneider’s medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal
calf serum (FCS, Lonza), and later they were adapted to Insect Xpress medium
for large-scale expression in 2-l shaker flasks. Stable cells were induced with
0.5 mM CuSO4 and harvested after 4 to 5 days at 27�C. Tangential flow filtra-
tion then was used to buffer exchange the supernatants into 100 mM Tris-HCl,
150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 15 mg/ml avidin (pH 8.0), and target proteins
were purified using Streptactin Superflow affinity (QIAGEN). GP ectodomains
were purified further with S200 size exclusion chromatography (SEC); sGP was
purified with S75 SEC. Recombinant ectodomains for EBOV, SUDV, or MARV
were designed and expressed similarly.
Screening and EC50 ELISA-Binding Analysis
Soluble forms of the full-length extracellular domain of BDBV, EBOV, SUDV, or
MARV GPs or the sGP form of BDBV GP were coated overnight onto 384-well
plates at 1 mg/ml. For screening ELISA, 10 ml supernate from a well of a tissue-
culture plate was transferred to each well of a 384-well ELISA plate. For EC50-
binding analysis by ELISA, purified antibodies were applied to the plates at a
concentration range of 30 mg/ml to 170 ng/ml, using 3-fold serial dilutions.
The presence of antibodies bound to the GP was determined using goat
anti-human IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate and p-nitrophenol phosphate
substrate tablets, with optical density read at 405 nm after 120 min. A non-
linear regression analysis was performed on the resulting curves using Prism
version 5 (GraphPad) to calculate EC50 values. The Circos software package
was used for data visualization (Krzywinski et al., 2009).
EBOV and MARV Neutralization Experiments
Isolated mAbs were screened initially in a high-throughput neutralization
assay using EBOV/BDBV-GP with or without 5% guinea pig complement
(MP Biomedicals) (P.A. Ilinykh, unpublished data). The mAbs that exhibited
neutralizing activity also were screened for neutralization of EGFP-expressing
EBOV (Towner et al., 2005). Several mAbs were tested for neutralization
of EBOV/SUDV-GP and EBOV/MARV-GP by the same approach. Additional
information is given in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
Biolayer Interferometry Competition-Binding Assay
Competition binding studies using biolayer interferometry and biotinylated
BDBV GP (EZ-link Micro NHS-PEG4-Biotinylation Kit, Thermo Scientific
21955) (5 mg/ml) were performed on an Octet RED biosensor (ForteBio), as
described previously (Flyak et al., 2015). In brief, the antigen was immobilized
onto streptavidin-coated biosensor tips. After a brief washing step, biosensor
tips were immersed first into the wells containing first antibody at a concentra-
tion of 100 mg/ml and then into the wells containing a second mAb at a concen-
tration of 100 mg/ml. The percentage binding of the second mAb in the pres-
ence of the first mAb was determined by comparing the maximal signal of
the second mAb applied after the first mAb complex to the maximal signal
of the second mAb alone.
Sequence Analysis of Antibody Variable Region Genes
Antibody variable gene sequence analysis was performed as previously
described (Flyak et al., 2015). Heavy-chain antibody variable region se-
quences were analyzed using the IMGT/V-Quest program (Brochet et al.,
2008; Giudicelli et al., 2011).
EM and Sample Preparation
Fabs were added in 10 M excess to BDBV GPdMuc and subsequently purified
and stained as previously described (Murin et al., 2014).
Image Processing of Protein Complexes
Particles were automatically picked using DoG Picker (Voss et al., 2009) and
particle stacks were generated using Appion (Lander et al., 2009). Subse-
quently, reference-free two-dimensional (2D) class averages were generated
using iterative multi-reference alignment (MRA)/multivariate statistical analysis
(MSA) (van Heel et al., 1996). Non-GP complexes and those with a clear lack of
full saturation by Fab were removed to generate a final stack for reconstruc-
tions. In some cases, orientation bias or flexibility of Fabs prevented conver-
gence of an acceptable model, although examination of class averages
allowed a general assignment of the epitope. Final stack class averages
were used to generate initial models using EMAN2 common lines (Tang
et al., 2007). A model matching its reference projections was further refined
using the entire raw particle stack with EMAN2, as described previously (Murin
et al., 2014). For the BDBV41 reconstruction, the EMAN2 reconstruction
lacked important features that were present in the class averages, indicating
that perhaps some particles lacked full Fab saturation. To circumvent this
problem, we utilized the Relion package, which allows three-dimensional
(3D) classification to remove particles that may only contain two Fabs, signif-
icantly improving the quality of the final EM map (Scheres, 2012). Modeling
fitting and EM figures were generated using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al.,
2004).
Epitope Mapping Using an EBOV GP Alanine-Scan Mutation Library
Comprehensive high-throughput alanine scanning (shotgun mutagenesis) was
carried out on an expression construct for EBOV GP (Yambuku-Mayinga
variant GP; UniProt: Q05320) (Davidson et al., 2015). Additional details are re-
ported in the Supplemental Experimental Procedures.
In Vivo Testing
The animal protocols for testing of mAbs in mice and guinea pigs were
approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the UTMB.
The 7-week-old BALB/c mice (Charles River Laboratories) were placed in
the ABSL-4 facility of the Galveston National Laboratory. Groups of mice at
five animals per group were injected with 1,000 PFU of the mouse-adapted
EBOV by the i.p. route. Then 24 or 72 hr later, animals were injected with indi-
vidual mAbs by the i.p. route using 100 mg per treatment. Animals treated with
the antibody specific to dengue virus 2D22 served as controls. Animals were
weighed and monitored daily over the 2-week period after challenge. Once
animals were symptomatic, they were examined no less than twice per day.
The disease was scored using the following parameters: dyspnea (possible
scores 0–5), recumbency (0–9), unresponsiveness (0–5), and bleeding/hemor-
rhage (0–5). To test the protective efficacy of mAbs in guinea pigs, five- to six-
week-old animals (strain Hartley) were placed in the ABSL-4 facility of the Gal-
veston National Laboratory. Groups of five animals per group were injected

 with 1,000 PFU of guinea pig-adapted EBOV by the i.p. route. Then 24 or 24
and 72 hr later, animals were injected with individual mAbs (5 mg per treat-
ment) or a cocktail of two mAbs (2.5 mg of each mAb per treatment). Animals
were weighed and monitored daily for 28 days. After animals became symp-
tomatic, they were examined no less than twice per day. The disease was
scored using the following parameters: appearance (possible scores 0–3),
body condition (0–3), natural behavior (0–3), and provoked behavior (0–3).
