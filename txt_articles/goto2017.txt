IMPORTANCE Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia is common and frequently associated with
poor outcomes. Evidence indicates that specific care processes are associated with improved
outcomes for patients with S aureus bacteremia, including appropriate antibiotic prescribing,
use of echocardiography to identify endocarditis, and consultation with infectious diseases
(ID) specialists. Whether use of these care processes has increased in routine care for S aureus
bacteremia or whether use of these processes has led to large-scale improvements in survival
is unknown.
OBJECTIVE To examine the association of evidence-based care processes in routine care
for S aureus bacteremia with mortality.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This retrospective observational cohort study examined
all patients admitted to Veterans Health Administration (VHA) acute care hospitals who had a
first episode of S aureus bacteremia from January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2014.
EXPOSURES Use of appropriate antibiotic therapy, echocardiography, and ID consultation.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Thirty-day all-cause mortality.
RESULTS Analyses included 36 868 patients in 124 hospitals (mean [SD] age, 66.4 [12.5]
years; 36 036 [97.7%] male), including 19 325 (52.4%) with infection due to
methicillin-resistant S aureus and 17 543 (47.6%) with infection due to methicillin-susceptible
S aureus. Risk-adjusted mortality decreased from 23.5% (95% CI, 23.3%-23.8%) in 2003 to
18.2% (95% CI, 17.9%-18.5%) in 2014. The number of patients who received appropriate
antibiotic 10 therapy Rates of appropriate antibiotic prescribing increased from 2467 (66.4%)
to 1991 (78.9%), echocardiography from 1256 (33.8%) to 1837 (72.8%), and ID consultation
from 1390 (37.4%) to 1717 (68.0%). After adjustment for patient characteristics, cohort year,
and other care processes, receipt of care processes was associated with lower mortality, with
adjusted odds ratios of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.68-0.79) for appropriate antibiotics, 0.73 (95% CI,
0.68-0.78) for echocardiography, and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.56-0.65) for ID consultation. Mortality
decreased progressively as the number of care processes that a patient received increased
(adjusted odds ratio for all 3 processes compared with none, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.30-0.36). An
estimated 57.3% (95% CI, 48.4%-69.9%) of the decrease in mortality between 2003 and
2014 could be attributed to increased use of these evidence-based care processes.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Mortality associated with S aureus bacteremia decreased
significantly in VHA hospitals, and a substantial portion of the decreasing mortality may have
been attributable to increased use of evidence-based care processes. The experience in VHA
hospitals demonstrates that increasing application of these care processes may improve
survival among patients with S aureus bacteremia in routine health care settings.

taphylococcus aureus bacteremia (SAB) is common and
frequentlyassociatedwithpooroutcomes.Theestimated
annual incidence of SAB in the United States and Europe
is5to40casesper100 000populationandhasbeenincreasing
inrecentdecadesbecauseofincreasingexposuretohealthcare.1-4
The SAB case fatality rate in the preantibiotic era was 80% and
has improved to 20% to 30% in previous reports.4-6
Largely observational evidence indicates that specific care
processes are associated with improved outcomes for patients
with SAB, including early source control,7,8 use of echocardi-
ography to identify endocarditis,7,9 appropriate antibiotic
prescribing,8,10 and consultation with infectious diseases (ID)
specialists to guide management.11,12 Treatment guidelines
and published expert opinions call for increased use of these
evidence-based care processes for patients with SAB.4,7,8,13,14
However, whether there have been widespread increases in
use of these evidence-based care processes for patients with
SAB or whether use of these processes has led to large-scale
decreases in SAB-associated mortality is unknown.
Large studies of SAB outcomes have previously been
difficult to perform in part because the administrative claims
data typically used to perform outcomes studies do not accu-
rately identify patients with SAB,15-17 and few large health care
databases have included microbiology results. The Veterans
Health Administration (VHA), the largest integrated health
care system in the United States, has recently aggregated
microbiology results nationally. We examined national VHA
microbiology data and other clinical and administrative data
to explore trends in the use of evidence-based care processes
and mortality among patients with SAB in 124 hospitals be-
tween 2003 and 2014. Our aim was to estimate the extent to
whichincreasinguseofevidence-basedcareprocessesmayhave
contributed to improving survival among patients with SAB.
Methods
The institutional review board of the University of Iowa and
the Research & Development Committee of the Iowa City
Veterans Affairs Health Care System approved this study and
waived informed consent for this retrospective cohort. All data
were deidentified.
Study Population and Data Source
We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of all
patientswithabloodculturepositiveforSaureusduringadmis-
siontoacutecareunitsat124VHAhospitalsinthe48continen-
talUnitedStates,theDistrictofColumbia,andPuertoRicofrom
January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2014. We obtained data
through the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infra-
structure,whichincludesdataextractedfromVHA’
sintegrated
electronic medical record. The methods used to extract micro-
biology results from electronic medical records have been de-
scribed previously.18 We also extracted antimicrobial suscepti-
bility data to classify isolates as methicillin-resistant S aureus
(MRSA) or methicillin-susceptible S aureus (MSSA). If a patient
had more than 1 episode of SAB during the study period, we
included only the first episode in the analysis.
Outcomes
Our primary outcome measure was all-cause 30-day mortal-
ity after the first blood culture positive for S aureus. Dates of
deathwereobtainedfromtheVHAVitalStatusFile,whichcom-
bines mortality information from multiple VHA and non-
VHA sources and tracks patients even if they leave the VHA
system. The Vital Status File has excellent agreement with the
National Death Index.19
Variable Definitions
For each patient, we defined time of bacteremia onset as the
time of the first sample obtainment for which the blood cul-
ture result was positive and classified places of acquisition as
community acquired (CA), health care associated (HCA), or
hospital onset (HO) according to previously published
definitions.20,21 The episode was considered to be HO bacter-
emia when the patient had been in the hospital for 48 hours
or longer at the time of the first positive blood culture result.
Among episodes that did not meet the criteria for HO bacter-
emia, HCA bacteremia was defined based on the following:
(1) admission to an acute care facility within 90 days before
the bacteremia episode, (2) residence in a nursing home or re-
habilitation facility, (3) receipt of renal replacement therapy,
or (4) receipt of wound care or specialized nursing care in an
outpatient setting or at home in the 30 days before the onset
of bacteremia. If the patient did not meet any of the above
criteria, the episode was classified as CA bacteremia.
Additional patient characteristics were identified using
diagnosis codes, laboratory tests, and vital signs. Specifi-
cally, laboratory test results and vital signs within 24 hours be-
fore and after the first positive blood culture result were col-
lected for each patient and categorized according to previously
described methods.22 Comorbidities were assessed using di-
agnosis codes based on the methods of Elixhauser et al23 and
thealgorithmproposedbyQuanetal.24Patient-leveldatawere
complete for all patients with the exception of vital signs, body
mass index, and laboratory values. These data were missing
in less than 8% of patients with the exception of serum albu-
min (missing in 31.8%) and bilirubin levels (missing in 31.3%).

Key Points
Questions Have outcomes for patients with Staphylococcus
aureus bacteremia improved, and how have changes in use of
evidence-based care processes affected outcomes?
Findings In this cohort study of 36 868 patients with S aureus
bacteremia at 124 Veterans Health Administration hospitals from
January 1, 2003, through December 31, 2014, all-cause 30-day
mortality decreased over time from 25.7% in 2003 to 16.5% in
2014, whereas use of appropriate antibiotic therapy,
echocardiography, and infectious diseases consultation increased.
An estimated 57.3% decrease in mortality could be attributed to
increased use of evidence-based care processes.
Meaning Increasing application of evidence-based care may
improve survival among patients with S aureus bacteremia in
routine health care settings.

 extractedfromtheVeteransAffairsInformaticsandComputing
Infrastructure to create a series of care quality process mea-
sures. We defined appropriate antimicrobial therapy as any
administration of recommended intravenous antimicrobial
therapy (ie, vancomycin or daptomycin for MRSA or penicil-
linase-resistant penicillins or first-generation cephalo-
sporins for MSSA) between the first positive blood culture
result and discharge.8,13,14,25 We defined echocardiography use
as completion of echocardiography (transthoracic or trans-
esophageal echocardiography) between the first positive
bloodcultureresultanddischargeandIDconsultationasacom-
pleted consultation order or documentation from ID consul-
tation services in the electronic medical records between the
first positive blood culture result and discharge. We manu-
ally reviewed titles of consultation orders and inpatient notes
to identify ID consultations. Specific details of findings and
recommendations from ID consultation notes and echocardi-
ography reports were not available.
Statistical Analysis
First, we compared characteristics of patients across the
number of evidence-based care processes received using χ2
tests for categorical measures and 1-way analysis of variance
or Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous measures. We used
Markov chain Monte Carlo imputation to estimate values for
missing variables. Crude mortality rates and use rates for
each evidence-based care process (ie, appropriate antibiotic
therapy, echocardiography use, and ID consultation) were
summarized by year, and statistical significance of trends
were assessed using Cochrane-Armitage test for trend.
Second, we fit a patient-level, multivariable logistic
regression model to predict all-cause 30-day mortality while
carefully avoiding overfitting. Patient characteristics were con-
sidered to be candidate variables for the risk adjustment model
if they were possibly related (P < .25) to mortality in bivariable
analyses and missingness before imputation was less
than 10%. This model included a random intercept for hospi-
tals to account for the grouping of patients within hospitals.
Detailed description of the model-building process is available
intheeMethodsintheSupplement.Theriskadjustmentmodel
for 30-day mortality included patient age, body mass index,
placeofbacteremiaacquisition,methicillinsusceptibilityofthe
S aureus isolate, 13 comorbidities, 4 vital signs, and 5 labora-
tory results. The model had excellent discrimination with a
C statistic of 0.809.26 Model validation revealed nearly identi-
cal receiver operating characteristic curves for the training and
validation data sets (eFigure 1 in the Supplement), which sug-
gests good prediction capability without overfitting.
Weusedthisriskadjustmentmodeltoassesstrendsinrisk-
standardized 30-day mortality rates over time. We assessed
patient-level associations between receipt of individual
evidence-based care processes and mortality by adding vari-
ables that indicated patients who received each of the 3 care
processes to the risk adjustment model one at a time. We then
included all 3 care processes in 1 model simultaneously after
assessing possible collinearity between care processes using
φ statistics for correlations between variables and variance
inflation factors. Models for associations between receipt of
care processes and mortality also included cohort year as a
series of fixed effects. In addition, we created indicator vari-
ables for all possible combinations of care processes that a pa-
tient could receive and determined associations between
mortality and each of the 8 possible combinations of care
processes. This method allowed us to assess associations be-
tween mortality and receipt of specific combinations of care
processes. We also evaluated for potential differential effects
overtimeusingstratifiedanalysesthatsplitthecohortintofour
3-year periods (2003-2005, 2006-2008, 2009-2011, and
2012-2014).
In addition, we conducted subgroup analyses for MSSA,
MRSA, and place of acquisition to determine whether mortal-
ity trends and associations with care processes were stable
across subgroups. Because patients who died early might not
have had time to receive evidence-based care processes, we
performed sensitivity analyses for associations between care
processes and mortality, excluding patients who did not
survive 2 or more days after the onset of bacteremia.
Finally, we used the method of recycled predictions as de-
scribed in the eMethods in the Supplement to compute the
marginal effects of increases in the number of care processes
on mortality to estimate the fraction of the change in mortal-
itythatmaybeattributedtochanginguseofcareprocessesover
time.27,28 All hypothesis tests were 2-sided, with a signifi-
cancelevelofP < .05.Statisticalanalyseswereperformedusing

Results
Study Population
Analyses included 36 868 patients in 124 hospitals (mean [SD]
age, 66.4 [12.5] years; range of mean age by year, 65.4-66.9
years; 36 036 [97.7%] male), including 19 325 (52.4%) with
MRSA infection and 17 543 (47.6%) with MSSA infection. The
number of cases decreased from 3717 in 2003 to 2524 in 2014
(Figure 1) principally because of decreases in the incidence of
HCAandHObacteremia(HCAbacteremia:1726in2003to1293
in 2014; HO bacteremia: 1318 in 2003 to 557 in 2014), whereas

 the frequency of CA bacteremia was stable between 2003 and
2014 (673 in 2003 to 674 in 2014). Overall crude mortality was
20.9%, which improved from 25.7% in 2003 to 16.5% in 2014
(P < .001 for trend).
Table 1 summarizes the patient characteristics. Approxi-
mately half of patients with SAB had HCA bacteremia (19 271
[52.3%]), whereas 8253 (22.4%) had CA bacteremia and
9344 (25.3%) had HO bacteremia. The median number of
Elixhauser comorbidities was 8 (interquartile range, 5-10),
with 34 324 patients (93.1%) having at least 1 cardiopulmo-
nary comorbidity, 11 392 (30.9%) with malignant tumors, and
23 411(63.5%)withatleast1mentalhealthcomorbidity.Table2
summarizes the model used for patient-level risk adjust-
ments. Risk-adjusted mortality decreased from 23.5% (95% CI,
23.3%-23.8%) in 2003 to 18.2% (95% CI, 17.9%-18.5%) in 2014
(Figure 1). Similar mortality trends were observed for MRSA,
MSSA, and all places of acquisition (ie, HCA, HO, and CA)
(eFigure 2 and eFigure 3 in the Supplement).

raphy was performed for 18 345 patients with SAB (49.8%), in-
cluding transesophageal echocardiography for 5522 (15.0%),
transthoracic echocardiography for 10 769 (29.2%), and un-
documented type of echocardiography for 2054 (5.6%). The
number of patients who had echocardiography increased from
1256 (33.8%) in 2003 to 1837 (72.8%) in 2014 (P for trend <.001)
(Figure 2 and eFigure 4 in the Supplement). Overall, 26 037 pa-
tients (70.6%) received appropriate antibiotic therapy for SAB
before discharge. Among patients with MRSA bacteremia,
16 890 (87.4%) received vancomycin or daptomycin, whereas
9140 patients with MSSA bacteremia (52.1%) received penicil-
linase-resistant penicillins or first-generation cephalo-
sporins. Among patients with MSSA infection who did not re-
ceive penicillinase-resistant penicillins or first-generation
cephalosporins, 6050 (72.0%) received vancomycin or dap-
tomycin. The proportion of patients who received appropri-
ate antibiotic therapy increased from 66.4% (n = 2467) in 2003
to 78.9% (n = 1991) in 2014 (P < .001 for trend) (Figure 2). The
proportionofappropriatetherapyincreasedintheMRSAgroup
(79.5% [n = 1685] in 2003 to 94.3% [n = 1037] in 2014; P < .001
for trend) and MSSA group (48.9% [n = 781] in 2003 to 66.9%
[n = 953] in 2014; P for trend <.001). A mild to moderate cor-
relation was found between use of each pair of care processes
(φ coefficient for ID consultation and echocardiography, 0.37;
ID consultation and appropriate therapy, 0.29; and echocar-
diography and appropriate therapy, 0.28). The number of pa-
tients who received all 3 of these care processes increased from
597 (16.1%) in 2003 to 1317 (52.2%) in 2014 (P < .001 for trend)
(eFigure 5 in the Supplement). In 2014, 533 patients (21.1%) did
not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy, 687 (27.2%) did not
have an echocardiogram to evaluate for endocarditis, 807
(32.0%) did not have ID consultation during their hospital stay,
and 223 (8.8%) received none of the care processes.
The use of echocardiography, ID consultation, and
appropriate therapy were associated with lower 30-day
mortality after adjustment for patient characteristics and
other care processes, with risk-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of
0.74 (95% CI, 0.68-0.79) for appropriate antibiotics, 0.73
(95% CI, 0.68-0.78) for echocardiography, and 0.61 (95% CI,
0.56-0.65) for ID consultation (Figure 3). In addition, there
was a dose-response relationship between the number of
evidence-based care processes that a patient received and
mortality (Figure 3), which occurred regardless of the spe-
cific combinations of care processes received. The risk-
adjusted OR for mortality was 0.33 (95% CI, 0.30-0.37) for
patients receiving all 3 care processes compared with
patients receiving no process.
Appropriate antibiotic therapy was associated with lower
30-daymortalityinsubgroupanalysesofpatientsinfectedwith
MRSA (risk-adjusted OR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.48-0.59) and those
infected with MSSA (risk-adjusted OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-
0.63) (eFigure 6 and eFigure 7 in the Supplement). The asso-
ciation between receipt of care processes and mortality was
generally stable across cohort years and by place of bacter-
emia onset (eFigure 8 and eFigure 9 in the Supplement).
Sensitivity analyses with elimination of patients who did not
survivefor2ormorecalendardaysafterbloodculturewasper-
formed also demonstrated associations between evidence-
based care processes and lower 30-day mortality (eFigure 9 in
the Supplement). Using recycled predictions across cohort
yearsandpatient-levelanalyses,weestimatedthat57.3%(95%
CI, 48.4%-69.9%) of the decrease in risk-adjusted mortality be-
tween 2003 and 2014 could be attributed to increased use of
the 3 evidence-based care processes.
Discussion
In the national VHA health care system, we observed lower
risk-adjusted mortality among patients with SAB when they
received evidence-based care processes, including appropri-
ateantibiotictherapy,echocardiography,andconsultationwith
ID specialists. Moreover, there was evidence of a dose-
response relationship between the number of care processes
that a patient received and mortality. On the basis of data from
this cohort, we estimated that 57.3% of the decrease in risk-
adjustedmortalityamongpatientswithSABbetween2003and
2014 could be attributed to increased use of these evidence-
based care processes.
These results from 124 hospitals suggest that advances in
care are driving decreases in mortality among patients with
SAB, a common and serious infection. By 2014, crude mortal-
ity among patients with SAB in the VHA was 16.5%, which is
lower than described in most published cohorts.1-4,29 It is plau-
sible that increasing use of appropriate antibiotic therapy and
echocardiographycontributedtodecreasingmortalitythrough
more rapid clearance of infection and earlier identification of
endocarditis. In addition, associations between echocardiog-
raphy use and mortality could occur if echocardiography was
also a marker for receipt of other beneficial procedures, such
as control of infectious sources through removal of infected
devices or abscess drainage. The mechanisms that link ID con-
sultation to decreasing mortality are less obvious, but based
on prior studies,4,11,12 ID physicians likely optimize antibiotic
prescribing and facilitate earlier identification and control of
infectious sources.

 Our results also indicate that opportunity remains for im-
provement in SAB outcomes through even greater use of evi-
dence-based care processes. Although the use of evidence-
based processes substantially improved during the study
period, approximately half (47.8%) of patients did not receive
all 3 processes in 2014. Assuming that some patients have
contraindications to echocardiography and allergies to anti-
biotics, substantial opportunity for improvement in these care
processes still likely remains. Evidence from a prior study29
indicates that quality improvement programs can increase use
of evidence-based care processes and improve outcomes for
patients with SAB. In 12 hospitals in Spain, implementation of
a quality improvement bundle, including use of appropriate
antibiotic therapy, echocardiography, and early source con-
trol (eg, catheter removal, abscess drainage), led to a 5.6%
absolutedecrease(22.3%inthepreinterventionperiodto16.7%
in the postintervention period) in 30-day mortality. Given this
evidence and the high prevalence of SAB, hospitals that do not
routinely apply these evidence-based practices should priori-
tize quality improvement programs that address SAB manage-
ment. In addition, our results support widespread tracking of
quality measures based on these care processes to guide SAB
quality improvement programs.
Our observation of decreasing mortality among patients
with SAB must be considered in the context of prior studies30,31
that describe decreasing mortality among VHA patients hospi-
talized with other conditions, such as congestive heart failure
and acute myocardial infarction. This finding raises the ques-
tion of whether there may be secular trends in the VHA popu-
lations that are associated with a generalized improvement in
hospital outcomes over time. We adjusted for factors poten-
tially driving secular trends by adjusting at the patient level for
cohort year and a wide range of patient characteristics, includ-
ingdemographicfeatures,comorbidities,siteofbacteremiaon-
set, MRSA vs MSSA infection, and illness severity based on vi-
tal signs and laboratory studies. When models were stratified

 by year, the associations between care processes and mortality
were generally constant throughout the cohort years and were
strongerinlateryearsofthecohort.Modelsforassociationsbe-
tweencareprocessesandmortalityalsoadjustedforcohortyear
to account for secular trends not captured by measured pa-
tient characteristics. Prior studies30,31 that described decreas-
ing mortality rates in VHA hospitals did not examine changes
in specific care processes that may be driving decreases in
mortality. Our study of SAB could help explain the decreasing
risk-adjusted mortality among VHA patients through the use
of disease-specific, evidence-based care processes.
This large cohort study also adds to the prior literature on
riskfactorsformortalityamongpatientswithSAB.Resultswere
generally similar to those previously reported in smaller co-
horts, with higher mortality associated with increasing age,
infection with MRSA compared with MSSA, selected comor-
bidities (eg, congestive heart failure, malignant tumors, and
liver disease), and patient vital signs and laboratory values that
indicate increased illness severity at bacteremia onset.
TheincidencesofHCAandHObacteremiadecreasedinVHA
hospitals between 2003 and 2014, whereas the incidence of CA
bacteremia was stable. It is plausible that the decrease in HCA
and HO infections was influenced by the VHA’

ventiontoreduceHCAMRSAinfections,whichbeganin2007.32
Incontrast,onewouldnotexpecttheinterventionsintheMRSA
bundle to reduce rates of CA bacteremia.
Limitations
Thisstudyhadlimitations.Asinanyobservationalstudy,there
is potential for unmeasured confounding. To fully explain our
results, confounding factors would need to have affected as-
sociations between year of cohort entry and mortality, year of
cohortentryanduseofevidence-basedcareprocesses,anduse
of evidence-based care processes and mortality.33,34 We also
relied on administrative data for diagnoses of comorbidities,
which may be inaccurate and allow residual confounding.35,36
In addition, we did not have detailed clinical data on sources
of bacteremia, whether these sources were controlled, or
presence of all sites of infection. Finally, most patients with
SAB in VHA hospitals were men, limiting the generalizability
of these findings to other populations.
Conclusions
We observed substantial increases in the use of evidence-
based care processes for patients with SAB between 2003
and 2014 that were associated with a marked decrease in
mortality. There is a need for continued implementation of
quality improvement initiatives to increase the adoption of
these evidence-based care processes for patients with SAB,
supported by quality measures that reflect use of these
processes.
