A cocktail of three virulent bacteriophages prevents
Vibrio cholerae infection in animal models
Minmin Yen1,2,*, Lynne S. Cairns1,* & Andrew Camilli1
Effective prevention strategies will be essential in reducing disease burden due to bacterial
infections. Here we harness the specificity and rapid-acting properties of bacteriophages as a
potential prophylaxis therapy for cholera, a severely dehydrating disease caused by Vibrio
cholerae. To this end, we test a cocktail of three virulent phages in two animal models of
cholera pathogenesis (infant mouse and rabbit models). Oral administration of the phages up
to 24 h before V. cholerae challenge reduces colonization of the intestinal tract and prevents
cholera-like diarrhea. None of the surviving V. cholerae colonies are resistant to all three
phages. Genome sequencing and variant analysis of the surviving colonies indicate
that resistance to the phages is largely conferred by mutations in genes required for the
production of the phage receptors. For acute infections, such as cholera, phage prophylaxis
could provide a strategy to limit the impact of bacterial disease on human health.

holera is an acute, severely dehydrating diarrheal disease
caused by the water-borne bacterium Vibrio cholerae.
Cholera remains a substantial global health burden and is
endemic to many parts of Africa and Asia1. Recent widespread
epidemics in disaster-stricken or war-torn countries such as
Haiti2 and Iraq3 highlight the vulnerabilities of populations to
sudden outbreaks. Current recommended preventatives include
mass
vaccinations
with
the
World
Health
Organization-
prequalified oral cholera vaccine4 and increased awareness of
sanitation and hygiene practices5. However, access to clean water
is difficult and vaccination campaigns require forethought and
time for efficacy; both methods may not be logistically feasible for
immediate protection in the event of an outbreak. Household
transmission is a major contributor to the rapid spread of
V. cholerae within communities. Household contacts of index
cases often present with cholera symptoms 2–3 days after the
initial patient becomes sick6. Therefore, there is currently an
unmet need for a clinical intervention to stem the household
spread of cholera by use of a rapid prophylactic treatment.
Although chemoprophylaxis with antibiotics may effectively
reduce cholera burden7, the World Health Organization does
not recommend this practice due to the development and spread
of drug-resistant bacteria (http://www.who.int/cholera/technical/
prevention/control/en/). Moreover, the broad-spectrum action of
antibiotics would cause dysbiosis of the resident intestinal
microbiota, which could put patients at risk of other intestinal
infections.
There has recently been a renewed interest in the use of
bacteriophages (phages) for environmental and clinical applica-
tions8. In contrast to antibiotics, phages are specific in their
targets and, because they are replicating viruses, are capable of
auto-dosing, a phenomenon where phage replication increases
their number and contributes to the dose. Previous attempts to
use phages to prevent or treat cholera have produced mixed
results. Dutta et al.9 showed that a single phage type given 1 h
before V. cholerae challenge in an infant rabbit model prevented
onset of cholera symptoms. Studies by Jaiswal et al.10 showed that
a cocktail of five lytic bacteriophage types given 6 or 12 h before
V. cholerae challenge in an adult rabbit model reduced diarrheal
severity slightly but did not significantly lower the bacterial load;
however, the same phage cocktail could successfully reduce the
V. cholerae load when administered 6 or 12 h after challenge.
A second study in adult mice also showed promise for treatment
of cholera with a phage cocktail11. These studies suggest that a
prophylaxis approach merits further, in-depth investigation.
We
previously
isolated
three
V.
cholerae-specific,
lytic
(virulent) phages ICP1, ICP2 and ICP3 from rice-water stool
samples of cholera patients in Bangladesh12. The receptors for
ICP1 and ICP2 were identified as the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)
O1 antigen13 and the major outer membrane porin OmpU14,
respectively, which are considered virulence factors of V. cholerae.
The receptor for ICP3 is as yet unknown, although we
hypothesize at least a partial role for the LPS O-antigen. We
have recently shown that these virulent phages impose significant
bactericidal pressure on V. cholerae during its natural course of
infection in humans14. A cocktail comprising phages that target
different receptors would reduce the likelihood of multi-phage-
resistant V. cholerae isolates in the surviving population.
Therefore, we hypothesized that a cocktail of the three ICP
phages may be used as a prophylaxis treatment to specifically
target V. cholerae that transits into the small intestine to prevent
signs of cholera in animal models of disease.
In this study, we show that orally applied, prophylactic use of
the ICP cocktail reduces colonization by V. cholerae in the infant
mouse model. The ICP cocktail also prevents the onset of cholera
symptoms in the infant rabbit model when administered up to
24 h before V. cholerae challenge. This proof-of-principle study
demonstrates the successful use of phage prophylaxis to prevent
disease caused by a mucosal pathogen.
Results
The three-phage ICP cocktail kills V. cholerae in vitro. Initial
in vitro killing time-course experiments provided support for the
hypothesis that the three-phage ICP cocktail was more effective in
killing V. cholerae than each phage in isolation (Fig. 1). Cultures
of V. cholerae E7946 (AC53) were grown in (i) the absence of
phage or in the presence of (ii) ICP1, (iii) ICP2, (iv) ICP3 or (v)
the ICP cocktail, at a multiplicity of infection of 1. Bacteria
(Fig. 1a) and phage (Fig. 1b) titres were enumerated every hour
for 8 h and then again at 12 and 24 h. Although the bacterial
population declined in all conditions initially, growth resumed for
cultures grown in the presence of ICP1 or ICP3 within 4–6 h,
respectively (Fig. 1a). Cells incubated in the presence of ICP2
resumed growth more slowly, but reached the same density as the
control within 24 h. In contrast, cells grown with the ICP cocktail
did not reach the same density as the no-phage control by the end
of the experiment. Phage titres dropped but remained stable for
all conditions over the course of the experiment (Fig. 1b). It is not
surprising that V. cholerae was able to escape phage predation

 over time, given that the starting inoculum was high (5 � 107
colony-forming units (CFU)) and probably contained phage-
resistant mutants that were positively selected.
The ICP cocktail reduces mouse small intestinal colonization.
The ICP cocktail was more effective than each phage alone in
killing V. cholerae in vitro. To test whether this was also true
in vivo, prophylaxis experiments were performed in the infant
mouse model of V. cholerae colonization. We hypothesized that
the ICP cocktail would be effective in preventing V. cholerae
infection of the infant mouse small intestine. Mice were divided
into five groups and received either (i) no phage, (ii) ICP1, (iii)
ICP2, (iv) ICP3 or (v) the ICP cocktail. Mice were given phages
(between 1 � 106 and 1 � 107 plaque-forming units (PFU)) by
orogastric inoculation 3 h before infection with 5 � 105 CFU V.
cholerae. After 24 h, mice were killed, and V. cholerae and phages
in the small intestine enumerated. As shown in Fig. 2a, the
number of surviving V. cholerae cells in the small intestine was
reduced by at least two orders of magnitude in all conditions
where phage was administered, in comparison with the non-
treated control, with ICP3 being the most successful single phage.
No V. cholerae were detected in the intestinal homogenates of
four out of five mice treated with the ICP cocktail (Po0.01,
Kruskal–Wallis test with the Dunn’s post-hoc multiple compar-
isons test). These data show that in comparison with ICP1 or
ICP2 alone, ICP3 alone or the ICP cocktail is superior at pre-
venting V. cholerae colonization. Phages were still detected in the
small intestine at the end of the experiment (Fig. 2b), suggesting
that these phages can survive and persist in the intestinal tract.
Although the bacterial count medians of the ICP3 alone and the
ICP cocktail groups are similar, we chose to proceed with
the ICP cocktail to reduce the probability that phage-resistant
V. cholerae isolates would survive.
Next, we aimed to test whether the ICP cocktail could still be
effective when administered up to 24 h before V. cholerae
infection. First, it was necessary to establish if phages could
survive in the small intestine for long periods in the absence of
their host bacterium. To do this, mice were dosed with phages
(between 3 � 107 and 3 � 108 PFU) by oral gavage and killed after
3, 6, 12 or 24 h. Phages were enumerated from intestinal
homogenates using plaque assays (Fig. 3a). After 3 h, the phage
titres for ICP1 and ICP3 were still stable, whereas ICP2 titres had
dropped B10-fold. For all three phages, titres dropped only
10- to 100-fold after 6–12 h. After 24 h, ICP1 and ICP2 were still
retained at B105 PFU per small intestine, whereas the titre of
ICP3 fell to between 102 and 104 PFU per small intestine. These
data further show that the ICP phages can survive in the intestinal
tract for at least 24 h in the absence of their host V. cholerae.
To test whether the ICP cocktail remained protective when
given several hours before exposure to V. cholerae, infant mice
were inoculated with the ICP cocktail 6, 12 or 24 h before
challenge with between 5 � 105 and 9 � 105 CFU V. cholerae.
A control group did not receive phage. The data presented in
Fig. 3b show that the 6 h prophylaxis was most successful; the
number of surviving V. cholerae cells fell at least three orders of
magnitude, in comparison with the no-phage group, with no
detectable V. cholerae for four of the seven mice that received
phage (Po0.0001, Kruskal–Wallis test with the Dunn’s post-hoc
multiple comparisons test). The number of V. cholerae cells was
also significantly lower for the 12 h group (Po0.001), with four of
these animals having no detectable V. cholerae at the end of the
experiment. The number of V. cholerae cells was also reduced two
orders of magnitude in the 24 h group. Furthermore, virulent
phages were still detectable 24 h post-infection (Fig. 3c).
To determine whether the ICP cocktail could limit colonization
when mice are given a higher challenge dose, infant mice were
inoculated with 1 � 108 CFU of V. cholerae, a dose B200-fold
higher than the experiment shown in Fig. 3b,c. The data
presented in Fig. 3d show that the ICP cocktail was effective in
reducing V. cholerae colonization of the small intestine by at least
two orders of magnitude when administered at either 6, 12 or
24 h before challenge. Phages were also still detected at 24 h post
infection at similar levels in all three phage-treated groups
(Fig. 3e). In concert, these data support the hypothesis that a
phage prophylaxis approach can be used to prevent V. cholerae
colonization of the small intestine.
V. cholerae could be isolated from intestinal homogenates of
several of the mice dosed with the ICP cocktail (Figs 2 and 3).
Owing to the complexity of infection within the gut, it is possible
that these bacteria survive because either they did not encounter
the ICP phages or these cells carry genetic mutations that allow
them to escape phage predation. To determine the phage
resistance profile of surviving cells, V. cholerae isolates from the

 experiment in Fig. 3b,c were randomly selected for colony
purification and used in efficiency of plating (EOP) assays. The
data are summarized in Supplementary Table 1 and detailed in
Supplementary Data 1. All isolates from mice that received the
ICP cocktail 6 or 12 h before challenge were sensitive to all three
ICP phages. The majority of isolates from mice given the ICP
cocktail 24 h before challenge were sensitive to all three ICP
phages; however, a small number showed differing ICP resistance
phenotypes.
To uncover the genetic basis for resistance, 24 V. cholerae
isolates were analysed by whole-genome sequencing followed by
variant analysis15–17. It was shown previously that slipped-strand
mispairing in the poly-A tracts of O-antigen synthesis genes can
result in abnormal O-antigen and confer ICP1 resistance13.
Consistent with this, the mutations in ICP1- and ICP3-resistant
isolates were found in O-antigen synthesis genes located on
chromosome 1 of V. cholerae between open reading frames
VC0240 (gmhD) and VC0269 (manA)18 (Supplementary Data 2).
Although LPS mutations were a common source of resistance in
these isolates, this is not of major concern given that strains
carrying such mutations have previously been shown to be
avirulent19–21. We have also shown previously that mutations
in ompU and toxR confer ICP2 resistance14. In agreement,
mutations in ICP2-resistant isolates were found in open reading
frames VC0633 (ompU) or VC0984 (toxR) (Supplementary
Data 2). Eight of the sequenced strains revealed no mutations
to explain their phage-resistant phenotypes, most likely due to
incomplete genome sequence coverage.
The ICP cocktail provides protection in the infant rabbit. To
further assess the ability of the ICP cocktail to prevent cholera,
experiments were undertaken in infant rabbits. In contrast to
infant mice, infant rabbits infected by V. cholerae develop the
profuse secretory diarrhea associated with cholera. Sickened
animals suffer from dehydration and weight loss and show an
accumulation of caecal fluid containing a high bacterial load22.

Figure 3 | V. cholerae burden in the infant mouse small intestine is reduced when the ICP cocktail is administered up to 24 h before infection.
(a) Phages are retained in the infant mouse small intestine in the absence of the V. cholerae host. Mice were dosed with between 3 � 107 and 3 � 108 PFU of
the indicated phage and killed after 3, 6, 12 or 24 h. Phages surviving in the small intestine were calculated by enumeration of PFU per small intestine from

between 2 � 105 and 4.8 � 105 PFU of the ICP cocktail either 6 h (n ¼ 7), 12 h (n ¼ 10) or 24 h (n ¼ 10) before infection with between 5 � 105 and 9 � 105
CFU V. cholerae E7946 (AC53). A control group did not receive phage (n ¼ 8). Twenty-four hours after infection, the mice were killed and V. cholerae
surviving in the small intestine enumerated by calculation of CFU per small intestine. (c) Phages surviving in the small intestine after the challenge
described in b were enumerated by calculation of PFU per small intestine from plaque assays. (d) Infant mice were dosed with between 1 � 108 and

(AC53). Twenty-four hours after infection, mice were killed and the V. cholerae surviving in the small intestine enumerated as CFU per small intestine, and

 intestinal tract in the absence of V. cholerae, animals were dosed
with the ICP cocktail alone (3 � 108 PFU). After 3 or 24 h, the
animals were killed and phages enumerated from intestinal
homogenates. Even after 24 h, 106 phages could be recovered
from the intestine (Fig. 4a).
To determine whether the ICP cocktail could block infection
by V. cholerae, phages (between 4 � 109 and 8 � 109 PFU) were
orogastrically administered to two groups of infant rabbits either
3 or 24 h before challenge with 5 � 108 CFU V. cholerae.
A control group did not receive phage. Animals were monitored
for signs of cholera, specifically weight loss (Supplementary
Fig. 1) and the presence of rice-water stool (also referred to here
as cholera-like diarrhea). The no-phage control group showed
cholera-like symptoms 12–14 h post infection, in line with
previously published observations22, and were killed at this
point. The caecum of each infected rabbit was distended and
accumulated B0.5–1 ml of fluid, which is further indicative of
V.
cholerae
infection.
Approximately
109–1010
CFU
were
enumerated from caecal fluid (Supplementary Table 2) and
intestinal homogenates (Fig. 4b) from this group.
V. cholerae were not detected for four of the seven rabbits that
were dosed with ICP cocktail 3 h before infection (Fig. 4b),
indicating that these animals cleared the infection. Between 106
and 108 CFU of V. cholerae were obtained from intestinal
homogenates from the remaining three rabbits in this group,
giving a 10- to 100,000-fold decrease in comparison with the non-
treated group (Fig. 4b, Po0.001, Kruskal–Wallis test with the
Dunn’s post-hoc multiple comparisons test). Between B105 and
109 CFU of V. cholerae were enumerated from the intestines of
animals dosed with phage 24 h before infection (Fig. 4b),
presenting a 10- to 100,000-fold decrease in bacterial load when
compared with animals that received no phage (Po0.05). It is
important to note that despite the bacterial load observed, there
was no evidence of rice-water stool or significant weight loss for
rabbits in either of the phage-dosed groups up to 20 h after
V. cholerae challenge (Supplementary Fig. 1). On dissection of
these animals, 0.1 ml of caecal fluid was obtained from one rabbit,
which was dosed with phage 24 h before V. cholerae infection.
The caeca of the other animals showed no signs of fluid
accumulation (Supplementary Table 2). Between 106 and 109
PFU could be collected from the intestinal homogenates of phage-
treated animals (Fig. 4c), indicating that phages persisted in the
intestine over the course of the experiment. These observations
suggest that the ICP cocktail protected against the signs of cholera
over the duration of the experiment.
To determine whether V. cholerae that survived phage
prophylaxis were sensitive or resistant to the ICP phages,
V. cholerae isolates from each of the intestinal homogenates
were randomly selected for colony purification and their phage
resistance phenotype measured by EOP assays (summarized in
Supplementary Table 3 and detailed in Supplementary Data 3).
Thirty-nine per cent of isolates were resistant to both ICP1 and
ICP3. No isolates were resistant to all three phages. To determine
the genetic basis for resistance, whole-genome sequencing and
variant analysis were conducted on 36 isolates, chosen due to
their differing resistance phenotypes (Supplementary Data 4).
Results were consistent with mutations found in ICP1- and
ICP3-resistant isolates from the mouse experiment in Fig. 3. For
33 of these strains, there were mutations in O-antigen synthesis
genes. For three strains, no mutations related to known phage-
resistance strategies were detected. We conclude from these data
in two animal models that the leading source of phage resistance
is mutation of the genes required for production of the phage
receptors.
Collectively, these data suggest that the phage cocktail (i) is
efficient at killing V. cholerae cells in vivo, (ii) reduces or prevents
V. cholerae colonization of the intestine and (iii) provides
protection against the onset of cholera-like diarrhoea in the
infant rabbit model of cholera infection. Furthermore, isolates
shed by the animal that were resistant to the ICP phages are
expected to be avirulent based on past studies of O1-antigen
mutants13, although virulence of these isolates has not yet been
tested.
Discussion
Here we show that prophylactic administration of a V. cholerae-
specific phage cocktail is protective against cholera, by reducing
both colonization and cholera-like diarrhoea in two animal
models. We have shown that the ICP cocktail can successfully kill

 V. cholerae in vitro, prevent colonization of the infant mouse and
preclude the onset of cholera-like diarrhoea in the infant rabbit.
V. cholerae were isolated from intestinal homogenates of some
phage-treated animals; however, the surviving population is
smaller than observed from a wild-type V. cholerae infection
(Figs 2–4). Moreover, we hypothesize that these surviving isolates
may be unable to elicit acute infection, as many of the mutations
that confer resistance to the ICP phages affect genes such as those
involved in LPS synthesis (VC0240 to VC0269), which have been
previously shown to be important for virulence. Crucially, at the
end of these experiments, the population also remains sensitive to
at least one of the three ICP phages. We suggest that the
effectiveness of the ICP cocktail in killing V. cholerae cells is at
least in part reliant on the concentration of phages that are in the
intestine at the time of V. cholerae infection. The complex
architecture of the intestinal tract probably presents a challenge to
the phages’ ability to access V. cholerae cells. The details of the
interplay between the ICP phages, V. cholerae and the host
remain to be elucidated.
Future optimization of the composition and dose of the
cocktail could further improve its effectiveness. The ratio of each
phage in the cocktail could be optimized and additional phages
could be added to improve V. cholerae killing. Furthermore, as
complete reduction of the bacterial load was only observed at
shorter prophylaxis times, optimization of the timing for each
dose is needed before human use. It is likely that an individual
will be repeatedly exposed to V. cholerae; therefore multiple doses
may be necessary to control the infection to a point where it can
be completely eradicated.
Current phage therapy research is largely focused on treating
ongoing infections. Our results highlight the potential of phage
therapy in preventing infections. The data presented herein
suggest that the premise of using a phage cocktail to prevent
cholera warrants further investigation. We anticipate that a rapid-
acting phage prophylaxis approach would be best used in at-risk
individuals, such as the household contacts of individuals who
display cholera symptoms. By limiting spread within households,
the overall burden of the disease could be reduced. The
application of phages as prophylactic treatments for mucosal
pathogens represents a fast and specific means by which to
restrict the impact of bacterial infections on human health.
Methods
Growth conditions and strains. Bacterial strains and phages used in this study are
listed in Table 1. V. cholerae strains were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth
supplemented with 100 mg ml � 1 streptomycin (Sm). The ICP cocktail comprises
the Vibrio phages ICP1, ICP2 and ICP3 in equal number. These phages were
previously isolated from Bangladeshi cholera patient rice-water stool samples12.
ICP1 was isolated on strain AC4741, whereas ICP2 and ICP3 were isolated on
AC53, an Sm-resistant isolate of E7946. All experiments were carried out using
AC53 V. cholerae O1 El Tor strain E7946. Strains AC4653 and AC2846 were used
in plaque assays as negative controls. ICP1 and ICP3 cannot plaque on AC4653,
whereas ICP2 cannot plaque on AC2846.
Bacteriophage preparation. High-titre stocks of the ICP phages were prepared by
growth on agar plates followed by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. Briefly,
each phage was grown with the appropriate V. cholerae strain in soft agarose
(LB broth supplemented with 0.3% agarose) overlays. Once confluent, overlays
were incubated with STE buffer (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA)
overnight at 4 �C with gentle rocking to elute phage. The STE-phage solution was
clarified by centrifugation, sterile-filtered and incubated with 1 � PEG (4% PEG
8000, 0.5 M NaCl) at 4 �C for 1–3 days, to allow for phage precipitation. Phages
were collected by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 15 min at 4 �C and the phage pellet
re-suspended in STE buffer. Phages were titred by plaque assay, as previously
described10.
In vitro phage-killing assay. Overnight cultures originating from single colonies
of V. cholerae were diluted back to an OD600 of 0.05 in 50 ml LB supplemented
with 100 mg ml � 1 Sm and grown at 37 �C with aeration. After 15 min, phages were
added to each culture. At the indicated time-points, samples were collected to
measure (i) CFU per ml and (ii) PFU per ml.
Infection of infant mice with V. cholerae. All animal experiments were in
accordance with the rules of the Department of Laboratory Animal Medicine at
Tufts University and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Four- and
5-day-old CD-1 infant mice (Charles River Laboratories) were infected. Each group
of mice was comprised of animals from at least two different litters. Both male and
female animals were used in this study. There was no observable correlation
between sex of the animal and outcome of each experiment. Numbers of mice used
in each condition in each experiment are listed in the legends of Figs 2 and 3. These
mice were not tested for the presence of resident V. cholerae phages as the animals
were not previously exposed to V. cholerae. As such, we do not predict that they
will harbour any V. cholerae-specific phages in their microbiome.
Infant mice in phage-treated groups were orogastrically dosed with phage
diluted in 2.5% sodium bicarbonate. Infant mice in cholera-treated groups received
ca. 105 CFU (‘normal’ infectious dose) or ca. 108 CFU (‘high’ infectious dose) of
V. cholerae diluted in 2.5% sodium bicarbonate. As phages were given at least 3 h
before bacteria, any multiplicity of infection calculated would be inaccurate.
Instead, the titres of bacteria and phage inoculated into animals were calculated
from the input materials and the ranges specified in the figure legends. Mice were
killed 24 h post infection, the longest infection time permitted in our protocol.
Small intestines were dissected and homogenized in LB broth supplemented with
20% glycerol. Cells were serially diluted and plated on LB agar supplemented with
100 mg ml � 1 Sm and CFU per small intestine was calculated. To extract phage
from small intestine homogenates, an aliquot of the intestinal homogenate was
treated with chloroform and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was
collected and used in plaque assays, to allow for calculation of PFU per small
intestine. To assess the resistance profile of V. cholerae cells that survive phage
prophylaxis, up to ten colonies were randomly picked per animal for use in EOP
assays with ICP1, ICP2 and ICP3.
Infection of infant rabbits with V. cholerae. Three-day-old New Zealand White
infant rabbits (Charles River Laboratories) were used in this study. Each group of
rabbits comprises animals from at least two different litters. Both male and female
animals were used in this study. There was no observable correlation between sex
of the animal and outcome of each experiment. Infant rabbits in phage-treated
groups were orogastrically dosed with phage diluted in 2.5% sodium bicarbonate.
Three hours before infection with V. cholerae, infant rabbits were pre-treated with
ranitidine hydrochloride to reduce stomach acidity (Caraco Pharmaceutical
Laboratories) by intraperitoneal injection (2 mg per gram body weight). Infant
rabbits were infected with 5 � 108 CFU V. cholerae AC53 diluted in 2.5% sodium
bicarbonate. As for the mice experiments, exact titres of bacteria and phage
inoculated were calculated from the input material and a range is detailed in the
figure legends. Animals were weighed at the start of the experiment and periodi-
cally throughout the course of the infection. Percentage body weight was calculated
by dividing body weight at the end of the infection period by body weight at the
start. Animals were killed 12–20 h post infection. Infant rabbits that suffer from
cholera typically lose 10–15% of their body weight within 12–14 h and are killed at
this time. Infant rabbits that lost o10% of their body weight are killed 20 h post
infection, in accordance with our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
protocol. This time restriction is necessary, as infants cannot be placed back with
their mother after V. cholerae infection due to culling behaviour and so are without
food for the infection period.
After dissection, the intestines of each rabbit were homogenized in LB broth
supplemented with 20% glycerol. Caecal fluid, if present, was collected with a 1 ml
syringe. Caecal fluid and intestinal homogenates were serially diluted and plated on
LB agar containing 100 mg ml � 1 Sm for calculation of CFU per intestine. Phages
were collected from homogenates as described for infection of infant mice.
Surviving V. cholerae colonies were colony-purified and assessed by EOP assays for
resistance to ICP phages.

 EOP assays. EOP assays were performed for isolates that survived phage preda-
tion. Each phage was titered on the isolate, on AC53 and also a phage-resistant
strain as a negative control (DwbeL AC4653 for ICP1 and ICP3; DompU AC2846
for ICP2). The EOP was calculated by dividing the titre of the phage on the animal
isolate by the titre of the phage on AC53. The limit of detection was 1 � 10-6.
Isolates were described as resistant when the EOP waso1 � 10 � 6, sensitive when
the EOP was41 � 10 � 1 or partially sensitive when the EOP was between these
values.
Sequence analysis of phage-resistant isolates. V. cholerae genomic DNA was
extracted using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). Whole-genome libraries
were prepared for single-end 150-bp sequencing using the Nextera XT DNA
Library Preparation Kit (Illumina). Sequencing was conducted at the Tufts
University Core Facility using an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Genomes were assembled
using CLC Genomics Workbench 8 software and aligned to the V. cholerae O1
N16961 reference genome13. To determine the mutations that may confer phage
resistance, variant analysis was performed on mapped reads with a frequency
threshold of 51%. Results were compared with AC53 variants14 to remove those
found in the wild-type inoculum. A surviving isolate that was determined to be
sensitive to all three ICP phages was sequenced and resulting variants were also
removed from resistant isolates variant analyses.

study are available within the paper and its Supplementary Information files.
