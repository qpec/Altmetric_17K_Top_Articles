Objectives: We investigated whether a Mediterranean-style diet (MedDiet) supplemented with fish oil can
improve mental health in adults suffering depression.
Methods: Adults with self-reported depression were randomized to receive fortnightly food hampers and
MedDiet cooking workshops for 3 months and fish oil supplements for 6 months, or attend social groups
fortnightly for 3 months. Assessments at baseline, 3 and 6 months included mental health, quality of life
(QoL) and dietary questionnaires, and blood samples for erythrocyte fatty acid analysis.
Results: n = 152 eligible adults aged 18–65 were recruited (n = 95 completed 3-month and n = 85
completed 6-month assessments). At 3 months, the MedDiet group had a higher MedDiet score (t = 3.95,
P < 0.01), consumed more vegetables (t = 3.95, P < 0.01), fruit (t = 2.10, P = 0.04), nuts (t = 2.29, P =
0.02), legumes (t = 2.41, P = 0.02) wholegrains (t = 2.63, P = 0.01), and vegetable diversity (t = 3.27, P <
0.01); less unhealthy snacks (t = −2.10, P = 0.04) and red meat/chicken (t = −2.13, P = 0.04). The
MedDiet group had greater reduction in depression (t = −2.24, P = 0.03) and improved mental health QoL
scores (t = 2.10, P = 0.04) at 3 months. Improved diet and mental health were sustained at 6 months.
Reduced depression was correlated with an increased MedDiet score (r = −0.298, P = 0.01), nuts (r
= −0.264, P = 0.01), and vegetable diversity (r = −0.303, P = 0.01). Other mental health improvements
had similar correlations, most notably for increased vegetable diversity and legumes. There were some
correlations between increased omega-3, decreased omega-6 and improved mental health.
Discussion: This is one of the first randomized controlled trials to show that healthy dietary changes are
achievable and, supplemented with fish oil, can improve mental health in people with depression.

 (38 million) were attributable to non-communicable
diseases, with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) the
leading cause.1 The 2013 Global Burden of Disease
report identified that, in both developing and devel-
oped countries, major depressive disorder now ranks
as the second highest cause of years of life lost due
to disability (YLD). From 1990 to 2013, YLD attrib-
uted
to
mental
and
substance
abuse
disorders
increased by 45%, depressive disorders by 53.4% and
CVDs by 89.2%,2 constituting a major burden of
disease worldwide with tremendous associated per-
sonal, psychosocial, and financial impacts.
It has long been known that people with CVD have
a higher incidence of depression than the general
population, and it is established that depression is a
risk factor for developing CVD.3 What is perhaps
less recognized is that depression and CVD share
similar underlying biological risk factors such as
inflammation,4–6 low levels of omega-3 polyunsatu-
rated
fatty
acids
(PUFAs)7–9
and
poor
diets.
Traditional Mediterranean diets, characterized by
high intake of plant foods (vegetables, fruit, legumes,
nuts, seeds, olives, wholegrains), extra virgin olive oil
as the main culinary fat, moderate intake of fish and
low intakes of confectionary, red meat, and processed
food,10 are emerging as protective for CVD.11,12
Meta-analyses of observational studies have shown
that a healthy diet13 and Mediterranean diet14 are
associated with lower risk of depression. People with
mental illness have been identified as having poorer
diet and other lifestyle behaviours that impact on
health, and less understanding of the impact of life-
style behaviours on health.15 Randomized controlled
trials (RCTs) such as the large Prevención con Dieta
Mediterránea (PREDIMED) study have successfully
implemented Mediterranean diets in adults with
CVD
risk.16
Secondary
analysis
from
the
PREDIMED study showed some trends for reduced
risk of depression in the MedDiet group17 but was
not powered for this outcome. We are aware of only
two dietary RCTs in people with depression; this
study18 and another Australian study which was
recently completed.19
Changing established dietary behaviours is challen-
ging, and this is attributed to factors such an obeso-
genic environment20 and the addictive nature of
high-fat high-sugar foods.21 However, there is evidence
that neural reward thresholds can be changed in
favour of preferring healthy over unhealthy food.22 A
Mediterranean diet not only has demonstrated health
benefits but is also a highly palatable diet and thus
more likely to become a sustainable part of a healthy
lifestyle.10
We
aimed
to
investigate
the
impacts
of
a
Mediterranean-style
diet
intervention
for
mental
health and quality of life (QoL) in people with
depression using a RCT design over 3 months with
follow-up at 6 months. Owing to the particularly low
levels of omega-3 PUFAs in people with mental
illness23 including this sample,24 we provided partici-
pants in the dietary intervention with fish oil sup-
plements for 6 months. This paper reports the dietary
changes that were achieved in a Mediterranean-style
diet (MedDiet) intervention group versus a social
(comparison) group, the impact on mental health,
and correlations between improved mental health out-
comes and changes in diet and erythrocyte (red blood
cell) omega-3 and omega-6 PUFA concentrations.
Methods
The detailed study protocol is published elsewhere.18
The trial was registered with the Australian New
Zealand
Clinical
Trials
Register
(ACTRN12614000438651).
Participants
According to Cohen’s power analyses,25 at least 60
people in each group are required to detect a
medium effect size with 80% power (n = 120) at the
usual 5% significance level. Allowing for an estimated
30% dropout rate the target sample size was n = 172.
We recruited 182 adults with either GP diagnosed or
self-reported depression over the previous 2 months
or more (which has a moderate level of agreement
with diagnosed depression26) in 2014 and 2015 via
the
community
using
newspaper
advertisements,
flyers, television and radio interviews, social media,
and a market research agency. Of those eligible volun-
teers,
163 attended
baseline
assessments. Eleven
participants retrospectively identified after baseline
assessments as not having a depression diagnosis
or a ‘moderate’ to ‘extremely severe’ score on the
depression subscale of the Depression Anxiety Stress
Scale (DASS – see below) were excluded from ana-
lyses,
leaving
a
total
sample
size
of
152.
A

Ethics, consent, and permissions
Ethics approval was provided by the Human Research
Ethics Committee of the University of South Australia
(Registration no. 0000032674) and all participants
provided written informed consent to take part in the
study.
Procedure
Interested volunteers were screened for eligibility by
phone. Inclusion criteria were age between 18 and 65
years and diagnosed or self-reported depressive symp-
toms over the previous 2 months or longer. People who
took fish oil supplements or had a high diet quality
score on an adapted dietary screening tool were
excluded. If participants were receiving treatment for

 their depression they were asked to continue what they
were doing. All participants were asked not to start
any new treatment for the 6-month duration of the
study. Eligible participants were sent detailed study
information and a consent form via post or e-mail.
On receipt of the signed consent form, they were
scheduled to attend the Sansom Institute for Health
Research clinic in Adelaide at the University of
South Australia for baseline assessments. Before
beginning baseline assessments participants were ran-
domized by a team member not involved in screening
or data collection to the MedDiet or Social group,
blocked on age and gender, using the process of mini-
mization.27 Data collectors and participants were
blinded to the treatment allocation until baseline
assessments
were
completed.
Investigators
were
blinded until after data were analyzed. Assessments
were conducted at baseline, 3 and 6 months.
At baseline and 3-month assessments participants in
the MedDiet group were given 3 months’ supply of fish
oil capsules (2 per day, grade EPAX 1050 TB each
containing 450 mg DHA and 100 EPA). All partici-
pants were scheduled for fortnightly group sessions
at the university campus for three months. For the
MedDiet group’s first visit they were given an interac-
tive nutrition education session led by a dietitian,
nutritionist and support study staff. For their sub-
sequent fortnightly visits they took part in cooking
workshops in a commercial kitchen at the university.
Recipes focussed on simple, healthy, affordable, tasty
meals using Mediterranean-style dietary principles.
These had previously been trialled in cooking work-
shops in a pilot study with people suffering from
severe mental illness, where positive dietary changes
and
improved
cardiometabolic
markers
were
achieved.28

 MedDiet participants were given food hampers that
provided ingredients for the recipe that had been
cooked, and in addition including 500 ml extra virgin
olive oil, vegetables, fruit, tinned legumes, tinned
tomatoes, tinned tuna and mixed nuts (almonds,
walnuts, hazelnuts). They were also given a link to a
website that provided recipes, resources and cooking
videos, and a printed book of recipes. The comparison
group attended a fortnightly ‘social’ group with
nibbles provided (i.e. biscuits, cheese, dips, tea/
coffee, and water/juice), held in tutorial rooms at the
university to control for the social interaction com-
ponent of the cooking workshops. These groups
undertook a range of social activities such as playing
games, sharing holiday photos, book club activities,
and
completing
personality
questionnaires.
Therapeutic discussion about depressive symptoms
was discouraged, although many participants formed
friendships as a result of the groups (similarly to the
MedDiet group during cooking workshops).
Measures
The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-21) and
the Assessment of Quality of Life (AQoL)-8D scores
were the primary outcome measures. Secondary
outcome
measures
included
the
Positive
and
Negative
Affect
Scale
(PANAS),
14-item
Mediterranean diet questionnaire, and the Simple
Dietary Questionnaire (SDQ). These are described
below. A sociodemographic and health behaviour
questionnaire collected information on age, gender,
education level (1 = completed primary school to 8 =
postgraduate degree), household income, and sleeping
difficulties (how many hours of sleep on average on
weeknights and weekends; and whether or not they
consider sleep to be a problem – yes/no/don’t
know). Socioeconomic status was determined from
participant postcodes using deciles of the Socio-
Economic Indexes For Areas (SEIFA), a ranking of
Australian neighbourhood disadvantaged and advan-
tage, based on census data for variables such as edu-
cation, income, and occupation status.29
DASS-21
The DASS is a 21-item self-report scale that provides a
measure of the level of negative emotional states of
depression, anxiety, and stress. It is a highly reliable
measure with high convergent validity and good
internal consistency with a Cronbach alpha of 0.82–
0.93.30,31 To identify degree of severity of these
emotional states, DASS-21 sub-scale severity ratings
were calculated based on the full DASS-42 severity
rating32 – each scale is multiplied by two and divided
into severity categories to yield equivalent scores
ranging from 1 (normal) to 5 (extremely severe) for
clinical purposes.
AQoL-8d
The AQoL-8D is a 35-item questionnaire that is used
to measure QoL. The 35 items load onto eight dimen-
sions, of which three represent physical domains of
QoL (independent living, pain, and senses) and five
represent psychological domains (happiness, self-
worth, coping, relationships, mental health). These
load
onto
two
super
dimensions
(physical
and
psycho-social). The scores from each dimension can
be further combined to create a total AQoL-8D utili-
ties score for use in economic evaluation. The
AQoL-8D has good validity and internal consistency
with alpha coefficients of 0.89–0.96.33
PANAS
The PANAS is a 20-item scale measuring positive and
negative emotions. It has been validated and demon-
strates reliable psychometric properties, discriminant,
convergent and construct validity. The reliability
(internal consistency) of the PANAS positive and
negative emotions scales were previously determined
to be α = 0.89 and 0.85, respectively.34
Dietary questionnaires
A validated 14-item Mediterranean diet questionnaire
was used to assess the level of adherence to the
Mediterranean diet. Each item is scored as 0 or 1,
yielding a maximum score of 14.35 Higher scores on
this questionnaire have been consistently associated
with reduced risk of mortality from or incidence of
CVD.36
A SDQ measured the frequency of intake of a range
of food groups including, for the purpose of this study,
vegetables, fruit, legumes, wholegrain foods, takeaway
foods (examples given were unhealthy options such as
burgers, chips, pizza), sweetened drinks, unhealthy
sweet and savoury snacks, fish, meat/chicken and
nuts. For each question a picture of the food was pro-
vided and the portion size was described. For each
food group, frequency of usual intake was reported
using six to nine-item response scales ranging from
never/don’t eat to consume seven or more serves per
day. For vegetables, fruit, wholegrain foods, takeaway
foods, snack foods, nuts, legumes, fish, and meat/
chicken a further qualifying question presented a
range of different items asking which of those had
been consumed in the past 2 weeks, in order to help
prompt memory about foods relevant to the previous
item as well as to measure dietary diversity. For the
purpose of this study diversity of fruit and vegetable
consumption were measured because of the variety
of bioprotective nutrients and phytonutrients provided
by
different
fruits
and
vegetables.37
Test–retest
reliability of the SDQ over 1–2 weeks in a different
sample (n = 66) ranged from r = 0.690 to r = 0.875
and validity coefficients with 24-hour recalls ranged
Parletta et al. Mediterranean-style diet improves depression

 from r = 0.256 to r = 0.569 with the majority greater
than r = 0.400 (unpublished). The SDQ will be
further validated against 3-day food diaries which par-
ticipants from the present study completed on two
week days and one weekend day at baseline.
Omega-3 fatty acids
Fasted blood samples were used to measure erythro-
cyte levels of n-3 PUFAs to quantify and separate
the direct contribution of fish oil supplementation to
any
improved
outcome
measures.
Fasted
blood
samples were collected in 6 ml EDTA tubes, red
blood cells were separated from plasma by low-speed
centrifugation and packed red blood cells were stored
in
1 ml
micro
tubes
at
−80°C
until
analysis.
Erythrocyte samples were thawed and prepared for
fatty acid analysis according to Swierk et al.38 using
the direct transesterification procedure according to
Lepage and Roy.39 Samples were analysed by flame-
ionization
gas
chromatography
(model
GC-17A,
Shimadzu) using a 50 m × 0.25 mm internal diameter
capillary column. One microlitre of the sample was
auto-injected into the column, and individual fatty
acids were quantified using the Shimadzu analysis
software (Class-VP 7.2.1 SP1, USA). Fatty acid
peaks were identified by comparison with known
fatty acid standards and quantitated by comparison
to the 21:0 internal standard (Nu-chek and Sigma).
Statistical analysis
Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Version
21.0 for Windows (Chicago, IL, USA). Descriptive
statistics (mean and standard deviation, M ± SD, or
number/percentage for categorical variables, n/%)
were used to provide baseline participant demo-
graphics,
and
t-tests
or
Chi-Square
(categorical
outcome) to check for differences between randomized
groups. Empirical distributions were examined for
continuous outcome variables to ensure that assump-
tions of normality are met. To analyse primary and
secondary outcomes and determine the effect of the
Mediterranean diet intervention, a linear mixed mod-
elling approach with variance component structure
was used to compare changes in the MedDiet and
social groups over time; this process includes all data
therefore
allowing
analysis
on
an
intent-to-treat
basis. To investigate whether changed dietary patterns
were associated with any positive outcomes in mental
health, changes in diet scores, omega-3 and omega-6
PUFA levels were entered into Pearson correlation
analyses with changes in mental health outcome
scores.
Results
Participants included in the analyses (with depression
diagnosis and/or DASS depression score in the
‘moderate’ to ‘extremely severe’ range) were comprised
of 105 females and 47 males aged between 18 and 65
years (M = 44 ± 13). This proportion reflects the
approximate 2/1 ratio of depression incidence in
women and men.40 Thirty-eight per cent of partici-
pants reported a depression diagnosis and 36 per
cent were taking anti-depressant medication. There
was no statistically significant difference in age
between those with (M = 46.5 ± 12.4) and without
(M = 42.9 ± 13.2) a depression diagnosis (P = 0.095)
and no significant difference in their baseline DASS
depression score (22.60 ± 10.82 and 22.28 ± 8.53,
respectively; P = 0.841) with both group means in
the ‘extremely severe’ category (>14). Of those
without a depression diagnosis, 86.4% ranked in the
severe to extremely severe categories of the DASS
depression scale compared with 86.0% of those with
a diagnosis. Demographics and health-related data
are broken down by treatment condition in Table 1.
There were no statistically significant differences in
demographic and health variables between groups,
indicating successful randomization.
From the 152 eligible participants who commenced
the study, 95 completed 3-month and 85 completed 6-
month assessments (Fig. 1). Retention to 3 months

 was 72% for the MedDiet group and 53% for the social
group (P = 0.013). Retention to 6 months (from base-
line) was 63% in the MedDiet group and 49% in the
social group (P = 0.068). Most volunteers who did
not complete the 3-month assessments dropped out
before attending their first workshop/social group.
There was no statistically significant difference in
severity of baseline DASS depression scores between
those who completed 3-month assessments (M =
21.9 ± 8.97) and those who did not (M = 23.3 ±
10.15; P = 0.381). There was also no statistically sig-
nificant difference in age, gender, SEIFA index, edu-
cation, or household income between those who
completed or did not complete 3 months.
Dietary changes
Changes in diet from baseline to 3 and 6 months in
each condition are provided in Table 2. Compared to
the social group, the MedDiet group reported signifi-
cantly greater increase in their total Mediterranean
diet score35 from baseline to 3 months (see Fig. 2),
along with a significantly greater increase in consump-
tion of vegetables, fruit, wholegrain foods, nuts and
legumes, significantly lower consumption of unhealthy
snacks and meat/chicken, and a greater diversity of
vegetables. Both groups reported reduced sweetened
drink intake which was not significantly different
between the groups. These dietary changes were main-
tained at 6 months (Table 2).
Mental health outcomes
Both the MedDiet and the social group reported sig-
nificantly improved mental health on all outcome
measures (DASS, PANAS, and AQoL-8D subscales)
over 3 months (all P < 0.001) except for the AQoL-
8D pain value. Compared to the social group, the
MedDiet group reported significantly greater improve-
ment in their DASS depression score (Table 3, Fig. 3),
and AQoL-8D mental health score over 3 months.
Depression scores improved by 45% in the MedDiet
group and 26.8% in the Social group – equating to
1.68 times greater improvement in depressive symp-
toms in the MedDiet group. All changes were sus-
tained at 6 months (Table 3; Fig. 4).
Correlations between dietary changes and
mental health changes over 3 months
Over 3 months there were several statistically signifi-
cant correlations between improved diet and better
mental
health,
as
shown
in
Table
4.
Higher
Mediterranean diet scores were significantly associated
with lower depression, anxiety, negative affect and
better coping and overall QoL. Higher vegetable con-
sumption was associated with less stress and more
positive emotions and happiness while higher fruit
consumption was associated with less anxiety and
more positive emotions and relationships. Higher
intake of nuts was associated with reduced depression,
anxiety and stress, and better mental health, self-worth
and overall QoL. More legumes were associated with
reduced
anxiety,
stress,
negative
emotions,
and
greater coping, psychosocial and overall QoL scores.
Greater diversity of vegetables was associated with
reduced depression, anxiety and negative emotions,
and higher positive emotions, and along with greater
diversity of fruits also with higher
independent
living, mental health, happiness, relationships, psycho-
social and overall QoL. Reduced intake of takeaway
food was associated with better pain and overall phys-
ical
health
QoL
scores
and
reduced
intake
of
unhealthy
snacks
was
associated
with
improved
mental health, coping and psychosocial QoL scores.
Correlations between erythrocyte
polyunsaturated fatty acids and mental health
Correlations between changes in erythrocyte omega-3
and omega-6 PUFAs and mental health scores are
shown in Table 5. Increased omega-3 PUFA eicosa-
pentaenoic acid (EPA) was significantly associated
with reduced anxiety and stress at 3 months and 6
months, and also with improved independent living,
senses and physical health at 6 months. Increased
omega-3 PUFA docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) was
associated with reduced stress and negative emotions
at 6 months. Decreased omega-6 PUFA arachidonic
acid (AA) was associated with decreased stress and
increased AQoL mental health, psychosocial and
overall QoL at both 3 and 6 months as well as lower
coping AQoL scores at 6 months. A reduced ratio of
AA to EPA was associated with better pain, senses
and physical health QoL scores at 6 months.
Discussion
Over three months the MedDiet intervention signifi-
cantly and substantially improved the diet quality of
people with self-reported depression when compared
with diet changes in the social group, with higher
total Mediterranean diet scores and increased intake
of vegetables, fruit, wholegrains, nuts, legumes and
greater diversity of vegetables, along with lower
intake of unhealthy snacks and meat/chicken. These
dietary improvements were sustained at 6 months.
Both groups reported significantly improved mental
health outcomes across all measures over 3 months
which were also sustained at 6 months. The MedDiet
group reported significantly greater improvements in
depression and overall mental health-related QoL

range of mental health outcomes were significantly
correlated with improvements in diet over 3 months,
most notably for greater diversity of vegetables and
fruit and intake of legumes but also including higher
Mediterranean diet score, vegetables, fruit and nuts

 and reduced consumption of unhealthy snacks, take-
away food, and meat.
The provision of free food has previously been
shown to be successful in increasing intake. For
instance, the PREDIMED study provided free nuts
(walnuts, almonds, and hazelnuts) or olive oil to treat-
ment groups, and showed that these groups consumed
more of these foods.16 This approach is compatible
with behavioural economics and ‘nudging’ principles,
i.e. using the path of least resistance, setting desirable
defaults,
making
healthy
food
more
available.41
Along with education, goal setting, and menu ideas,
continued exposure to and familiarity with healthy
foods such as vegetables can increase liking and prefer-
ence for that food.42 Furthermore, learning basic
cooking skills and hands-on learning of healthy
recipes is empowering and has previously been associ-
ated with healthier food choices.43,44 We successfully
applied these strategies using the HELFIMED proto-
col in a pilot study for people with serious mental
illness28 and now in the present study. These skills,
combined with the palatability and variety offered by
a Mediterranean-style diet, may help to account for
the sustained improvements shown over 6 months
and potentially over the longer term.
To measure the impact of fish oil supplementation
on mental health we measured erythrocyte omega-3
and omega-6 PUFAs. There were a small number of
correlations
between
decreased
AA
(omega-6
PUFA), increased EPA and DHA and decreased
ratio of AA/EPA and improved mental health over 3
and 6 months. We have observed previously that
when fish oil is consumed and erythrocyte omega-3
PUFAs increase, the omega-6 levels decrease as they
are
displaced
from
the
cell
membranes.45–47
Increased use of olive oil may have also reduced use
of vegetable oils containing omega-6 PUFAs. The
ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 PUFAs in cell mem-
branes reflects dietary intake, which has a higher
omega-6 to omega-3 ratio in Western diets compared
to traditional diets globally48 and in Australia.49

 This can contribute to a pro-inflammatory state, given
the inflammatory properties of eicosanoids produced
by AA and anti-inflammatory properties of eicosa-
noids produced by EPA.48 Furthermore, given the
high concentration of DHA in neural membranes
and its established role in a range of critical brain func-
tions,8 low omega-3 PUFA intake has been reflected in
mental health outcomes50 including depression.51 The
present
study
showed
no
significant
correlation
between increased omega-3 and improved depressive
symptoms, although improved depression scores were
associated with a decreased ratio of AA (omega-6) to
EPA (omega-3). Improved depression was also signifi-
cantly correlated with increased Mediterranean diet
scores. A range of essential nutrients are required for
healthy brain function and they also work synergisti-
cally; therefore improving the whole diet is likely to
have far greater benefit for mental health than any
single nutrient alone.8 An interesting trial
with
elderly people with mild cognitive impairment recently
discovered that reduced brain atrophy, and therefore
risk of developing dementia, following Vitamin B sup-
plementation was greatest in those adults who had
adequate omega-3 levels.52 This supports the conten-
tion that single nutrient trials are limited.

Parletta et al. Mediterranean-style diet improves depression
Nutritional Neuroscience

 The improved mental health that was observed in
both groups may in part be attributed to the social
component of the study as both groups were exposed
to group workshops (either cooking or social group).
Furthermore, as all participants had depression there
was an element of peer support in the group
dynamic in both the social group and cooking work-
shops (where participants also share a meal together).
Peer support, and particularly group-based peer
support has been shown to be effective for treating
depression, with equal efficacy to psychotherapy.53
Nonetheless, there was evidence of greater improve-
ment in the MedDiet group, consistent with popu-
lation studies that have reported cross-sectional and
longitudinal associations
between poor diet and
increased risk of depression, and conversely healthier
diet and decreased risk.13 This was supported in our
study by multiple significant correlations between
improved diet and mental health. The magnitude of
benefit was large, with 60% fewer persons experiencing
extremely severe levels of depression, 72% of anxiety
and 69% of stress in the MedDiet group. The improved
mental health in both groups is noteworthy, given that
the Mediterranean diet is not just about healthy food –
it is also about lifestyle, and this has been factored into
the Mediterranean diet pyramid by including cultural
and lifestyle elements such as conviviality and culinary
activities.10 Indeed, the cooking workshops we con-
ducted previously with people who have serious
mental illness were the most popular of all the work-
shops
offered
at
Community
Residential
Care
centres. As participants cooked and ate together,
they progressively became more socially engaged as
the workshops progressed.28
Nonetheless, there are also well-described biological
mechanisms that support a causal underpinning to the
observed relationship between diet and mental health.
Dietary nutrients – including vitamins, minerals, poly-
unsaturated fats and amino acids – are essential for
healthy brain structure and function. Nutrients are
required
as
cofactors
for
hundreds
of
different
enzymes; they support metabolic pathways, neuro-
transmitter synthesis, cell signalling, myelin sheath
maintenance, glucose and lipid metabolism, mito-
chondrial
function,
prevention
of oxidation and
more.54,55 Furthermore, factors that underpin poor
physical health like inflammation, glucose intolerance,
impaired cerebral blood flow and oxidative stress, also
impact on mental health.6,8,9,55,56 These factors are all
related to poor diet.
This study is potentially limited by the fact that it
was only single blinded, as participants could not be
blinded to their treatment allocation. The measures
and diet records are self-reported which cannot rule
out expectation bias. Further, we recruited people
with self-reported depression which may limit the
generalizability to people with diagnosed depression
– although there was no significant difference in sever-
ity of depression reported at baseline between those
who were diagnosed or not. Drop out levels were rela-
tively high, and more so in the social group, which
may limit the generalizability of the results. We
observed that many people dropped out from the
social group because they had enrolled in the study
in the hope of receiving dietary and cooking edu-
cation, and expressed disappointment when advised
of their group allocation after baseline assessments.
Depression scores, gender, age, and income were not
significantly different between those who completed
3-month assessments and those who dropped out.
Strengths of the study include the study design; being
a RCT; participants were instructed not to change
any existing therapy or start any new therapy; and
the 6-month follow up. Nonetheless, longer trials are
needed to assess longer-term sustainability of the
dietary changes and reduced depressive symptoms.
We were able to correlate reported changes in diet/
PUFAs and mental health outcomes to show that
improvements were related to positive dietary and/or
PUFA changes. Future studies with larger sample
sizes could extend this with objective measures such
as biological markers of improved dietary intake
(e.g. carotenoids, urinary hydroxytyrosol) and under-
lying mechanisms for improved symptoms such as
reduced
inflammation,
oxidation
and
increased
brain-derived neurotrophic factor and correlating
those with improved symptoms, as well as more
robust inferential analyses (linear models for repeated
measures
adjusting
for
potential
confounders).
Importantly, we controlled for the social aspect of
the cooking workshops (and research involvement
more generally) to which people with depression can
respond positively. Finally, statistical analysis included
all cases, instead of being limited to cases with com-
plete assessments over time.
This study supports preliminary findings from other
dietary interventions that showed evidence of reduced
depression in people with high CVD risk,17 metabolic
syndrome,57 and unexpectedly in a trial of problem
solving in elderly adults at risk for depression in the
dietary arm that was used as a control.58 Our study
is one of the first RCTs to show benefits of healthier
diet for mental health in a cohort of people with
depression. Another Australian study was recently
published,
reporting
improvements
in
depressive
symptoms of people suffering major depressive dis-
order,
and
32.3%
achieving
remission
over
12
weeks.59 In our study, the average depression score of
the MedDiet group fell below the extremely severe
depression cut-off, whereas in the social group it
remained in the extremely severe range. Interestingly,
while our study design was group based, the latter

 intervention involved one-on-one dietetic counselling
in the dietary arm and ‘buddying’ as a control arm,
and had similar findings. More studies with larger
sample sizes and objective markers are required.
Westernized societies have developed an alarming
culture of increased takeaway and ultra-processed
food consumption which not only has dire health con-
sequences but has also removed people from enjoying
the whole process of growing, cooking, and enjoying
good wholesome food together. With the increased
personal, societal and financial burden of chronic
physical and mental illness, getting back to basics by
promoting cooking skills and family/group meals
could be such a simple yet powerful and empowering
approach to healthcare and prevention.
