Parental Perception of Weight Status 
and Weight Gain Across Childhood
Eric Robinson, PhD, 
a Angelina R. Sutin, PhDb
abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Parents of children who are overweight often fail to accurately 
identify their child’s weight status. Although these misperceptions are presumed to be a 
major public health concern, little research has examined whether parental perceptions of 
child weight status are protective against weight gain during childhood. Our objective was 
to examine whether parental perceptions of child weight status are associated with weight 
gain across childhood.
METHODS: Data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children were used to assess 
parental perceptions of child weight status and to examine changes in researcher measured 
child BMI z scores across childhood, from 4 to 13 years old. Participants included 3557 
Australian children and their parents.
RESULTS: Children whose parents perceived their weight as being “overweight, 
” as opposed 
to “about the right weight, 
” gained more weight (increase in BMI z score) from baseline to 
follow-up in all analyses. This finding did not depend on the actual weight of the child; the 
association between perceiving one’s child as being overweight and future weight gain was 
similar among children whose parents accurately and inaccurately believed their child was 
overweight.
CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to popular belief, parental identification of child overweight is not 
protective against further weight gain. Rather, it is associated with more weight gain across 
childhood. Further research is needed to understand how parental perceptions of child 
weight may counterintuitively contribute to obesity.

WHAT’S KNOWN ON THIS SUBJECT: Parental 
misperceptions of child weight status are common, 
but we do not know whether parental identifi
 cation 
of child overweight is protective against weight gain 
across childhood or whether it may be associated 
with increased weight gain.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS: Contrary to popular belief, 
these fi
 ndings suggest that a parent’s perception of 
his or her child as “overweight” is not a protective 
factor against weight gain and is instead associated 
with an increased risk of future weight gain across 
childhood.

ROBINSON and SUTIN 
The health consequences of 
childhood obesity are well 
recognized. In the United States 
alone, >15% of children are classed 
as being of obese body weight.1, 
2 
One consequence of the worldwide 
obesity pandemic is that more people 
are now classified as overweight than 
“normal” weight in many countries.3 
With overweight now the norm, both 
medical professionals and the general 
public have difficulty identifying who 
is overweight or obese.4–6 Consistent 
with this evidence, parents of 
children who are overweight often 
fail to recognize their child as 
overweight.7, 
8
A common assumption is that 
parental failure to recognize 
childhood overweight is a 
major public health concern7–9 
because parents regulate both 
what a child eats and his or her 
opportunities for physical activity. 
Parental perceptions of child 
weight status are a key part of 
many obesity intervention and 
prevention programs, such as 
school measurement programs in 
the United Kingdom and United 
States, in which parents receive 
feedback about their child’s weight 
status.10–12 The cornerstone of such 
programs rests on the assumption 
that parents will be better placed 
to address their child’s weight 
when they perceive it accurately.13 
Evidence of the effectiveness of these 
types of interventions is limited, 
and it is not clear that altering 
parental perceptions of child weight 
status has an effect on the child’s 
weight.11 Although accurate parental 
identification of child overweight 
is thought to be an important 
step in challenging childhood 
obesity, an opposing view is that the 
stigma attached to the label of being 
“overweight” may actually be more 
harmful than beneficial.14, 
15 
Overweight is a stigmatized 
condition, 
16 and identifying oneself 
as overweight is stressful17 and 
associated with maladaptive coping 
responses18 that could lead to weight 
gain.19 For example, regardless of 
actual weight, adolescents who 
reported having been labeled as “too 
fat” by a family member or peer were 
more likely to become obese nearly a 
decade later.20
To date, few longitudinal studies 
have examined whether parental 
identification of overweight is 
associated with more or less 
weight gain across childhood. 
The 2 studies21, 
22 that examined 
the association between parental 
perceptions of child weight status 
and weight gain produced mixed 
findings. The mixed findings may 
be due, in part, to the use of small 
nonrepresentative samples and 
self-reported measures of child 
weight change. The aim of the 
present research was to examine 
the relation between parental 
perceptions of child weight status 
and longitudinal changes in weight 
across childhood. To achieve this aim, 
we made use of recently collected 
nationally representative data from 
the Longitudinal Study of Australian 
Children (LSAC), which allowed 
us to track changes in objectively 
measured child weight from ages 4 
to 13 years.
METHODS
Sample Information
The LSAC is a longitudinal cohort 
study of Australian children and their 
families. In 2004, 2 representative 
cohorts of Australian children 
(infants and children aged 4–5 
years) were recruited into the study. 
For detailed information about the 
LSAC see Soloff and Johnstone.23 
In the current study, we made use 
of data from children and their 
families recruited into the 2004 
older cohort (ie, the children were 
4 or 5 years at entry). In this cohort, 
parents reported their perceptions 
of their child’s weight status and 
anthropometric measurements of 
child weight were taken at every 
assessment from ages 4 to 5 years 
through ages 12 to 13 years at 
regular (2-year) intervals. The infant 
cohort of LSAC did not measure 
parent perceptions of their child’s 
weight and thus could not be 
included in the analyses. Parental 
written informed consent for each 
studied family was obtained and the 
protocols for the LSAC study were 
approved by the Australian Institute 
of Family Studies Ethics Committee.
Response Rate
The response rate for the older 
cohort in the overall LSAC sample 
was 80%.24 Not all families had 
complete data on the variables 
of interest for the current study, 
however. At the baseline assessment 
at age 4 to 5 years, 4598 families 
had information on all variables 
necessary for the analysis. At the 
most recent assessment at age 12 
to 13 years, a total of 3557 of the 
children were measured again. The 
main analysis is based on this sample 
size.
Measurement of Child BMI
A trained researcher took 
measurements of child weight and 
height during the in-home interview. 
Weight was measured using glass 
bathroom scales (children were in 
light clothing) and recorded to the 
nearest 50 g. Height was measured 
by using a portable stadiometer 
and recorded to the nearest 0.1 cm. 
Age- and gender-specific child BMI 
z scores were calculated according 
to Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention growth charts25 with 
increases in BMI z scores denoting 
weight gain.
Parental Perceptions of Weight 
Status
As part of an in-home visit interview 
about the child’s health, parents 
(97% mothers) were asked to select 
a response to the question “Which 
of these best describes your child?”; 
responses were underweight, normal

weight, somewhat overweight, 
very overweight, don’t know. In 
the current study, as in previous 
research on parental perceptions 
of child weight status, 
7 our interest 
was in identification of childhood 
overweight; thus, parents who 
identified their child as being 
somewhat or very overweight 
were combined and categorized as 
having perceived their child as being 
“overweight.”
Demographic Variables
A range of demographic variables 
were measured as part of LSAC. We 
made use of measured demographic 
variables likely to be associated with 
either child weight gain or parental 
perceptions of child weight status to 
control for these variables in analyses 
examining the longitudinal association 
between parental perceptions of 
child weight status and child weight 
gain. These variables included child 
gender, household income, number 
of child medical conditions, ethnicity, 
household language use, and baseline 
child BMI z score. In a further set 
of analyses we also examined the 
effect of including parental BMI (both 
mother and father) as additional 
control variables.
Analysis Strategy
To assess the longitudinal association 
between parental perceptions of 
child weight status and child weight 
gain (operationalized using BMI z 
score data), we made use of OLS 
linear regression models to predict 
follow-up child BMI z score while 
controlling for baseline BMI z score 
and all other demographic variables. 
Because parents could perceive 
their child as being underweight, 
normal weight, or overweight 
(“somewhat” or “very” combined), 
we used dummy coding to compare 
the effect of perceived overweight 
and perceived underweight to 
perceived normal weight in the 
same regression models. In our main 
analysis, we examined the statistical 
effect of parental perceptions of 
child weight status measured at the 
earliest baseline time point (age 4–5 
years) on child weight measured at 
age 12 to 13 years (the most current 
available data). We also examined 
the effect of parental perceptions of 
child weight status on weight gain 
at 2-year intervals to test whether 
any effect of parental perceptions 
of child weight status on weight 
gain was limited to a specific period 
in childhood or was observed 
consistently across childhood. In an 
additional set of analyses, we also 
computed interaction terms between 
parental perceptions of weight 
status (overweight and underweight 
separately) and baseline child BMI 
z score. This final analysis allowed us 
to examine whether any statistical 
effect of perceived weight status on 
weight gain was moderated by the 
child’s actual weight at baseline.
RESULTS
Sample Characteristics
At baseline (age 4–5 years in 2004), 
19.7% of children were overweight 
or obese and 75.4% were of 
“normal” weight. The sample was 
predominantly white. See Table 1 for 
sample characteristics.
Parental Perceptions of Weight 
Status
A substantial proportion of 
overweight children were perceived 
as being “normal weight” by their 
parents. Children of parents who 
perceived their weight as being 
“overweight” tended to be in either 
the “normal” or overweight range, 
whereas children of parents who 
perceived their weight as being 
“underweight” tended to be in the 
underweight or “normal” weight 
range (Table 2).
Parental Perceptions of Overweight: 
Longitudinal Changes to Child BMI
Parental perceptions of overweight 
measured at age 4 to 5 years 
predicted increases in BMI z scores 
from age 4–5 to 12–13 years: all 
children gained weight, but parents 
who perceived their child’s weight 
status as “overweight” had children 
who gained more weight across the 
8-year follow-up compared with 
children whose parents perceived 
their weight as being “normal” 
(Table 3). Controlling for parental 
BMI did not attenuate the statistical 
significance of this effect (see 
Supplemental Tables). Moreover, 
we found that this association 
was observed across childhood, 
with parental perceptions of child 
overweight consistently predicting 
more weight gain across all of the 
2-year intervals during the study 
(Table 3). Thus, a parent identifying 
his or her child as overweight was 
not protective against weight gain 
but was instead associated with 
greater weight gain across childhood.

ROBINSON and SUTIN 
We also tested whether parental 
perceived overweight interacted 
with baseline child weight (BMI 
z score). When included in all of the 
preceding models, there were no 
significant interactions between child 
BMI z score and parental perceptions 
of overweight (see Supplemental 
Tables). This suggests that the 
association between identifying 
one’s own child as being overweight 
and weight gain was not dependent 
on the actual BMI of the child; both 
accurate and inaccurate identification 
of child overweight were similarly 
associated with weight gain in this 
study.
Perceived Underweight: Longitudinal 
Changes to Child BMI
Perceived underweight measured 
at age 4 to 5 years also predicted 
changes to BMI z scores between 4–5 
years to 12–13 years. Children whose 
parents perceived their weight as 
being “underweight” gained less 
weight compared with children 
whose parents perceived their weight 
as “normal.” We found that this 
association was significant across 
all 2-year intervals during the study 
(Table 3). We also tested whether 
perceived underweight interacted 
with baseline child BMI z score in all 
models. This interaction was negative 
and significant in the majority of 
analyses (see Supplemental Tables). 
This interaction indicated that 
the association between parental 
perceptions of underweight and 
reduced weight gain was most 
pronounced for children who were 
already underweight.
Additional Analyses
We also examined whether child 
gender moderated the associations 
between parental perceived 
overweight or parental perceived 
underweight (measured at age 
4–5 years) and weight gain (BMI 
z score, 4–5 years at baseline and 
followed up at age 12–13 years)

status perception interactions. 
Gender did not interact with 
parental perceptions of overweight 
(P = .80) or parental perceptions of 
underweight (P = .32). To examine 
the robustness of the association 
between parental perceptions of 
overweight and child weight gain, 
we also examined whether the same 
pattern of results we observed when 
using BMI z scores was replicated 
when using raw BMI data, and this 
was the case (Supplemental Tables).
DISCUSSION
Results from the current study are 
consistent with the observation 
that parents of children who are 
overweight often fail to recognize 
their child as being overweight.7–9, 
28 
Although presumed to be a major 
public health concern, little research 
has examined whether parental 
perceptions of child weight status are 
actually protective against weight 
gain during childhood. The main 
finding of the current study is that 
a parent identifying his or her child 
as overweight was not protective 
against further weight gain. Rather, 
it was consistently associated with 
a greater risk of more weight gain 
(measured using BMI z scores). 
Moreover, this association was not 
dependent on the actual weight of the 
child; perceiving one’s child as being 
overweight was associated with 
greater weight gain among children 
whose weight status was accurately 
identified as being overweight and 
those whose weight status was 
overestimated. These results are 
consistent with a recent study that 
relied on self-reported changes in 
child weight, 
22 although a smaller 
nonrepresentative study did not find 
an association between parental 
perceptions of child weight status 
and weight gain.23
The present findings have 
implications for childhood obesity 
initiatives. It has long been presumed 
that parental identification of 
overweight is important to obesity 
intervention efforts.7–9, 
28 For 
example, in the United Kingdom and 
United States, national measurement 
programs are in place to correct 
parental perceptions of child 
weight.10, 
11, 
29 Until now there has 
been little formal assessment of 
whether such interventions do in fact 
protect against further weight gain.13 
The current study is among the first 
reported to examine how parental 
perceptions of child weight status 
predict changes to weight gain across 
childhood. Our findings suggest that 
contrary to popular belief, parental 
identification of child overweight is 
associated with greater weight gain. 
Thus, there is now a greater need 
than ever to systematically assess the 
effectiveness of child measurement 
and obesity screening interventions 
delivered to parents.13
The present findings on the 
association that parental perceptions 
of overweight had with elevated 
weight gain are consistent with 
emerging data from studies that 
examine personal self-perceptions 
of weight status. In particular, a 
series of studies have shown that 
among both normal weight and 
overweight adolescents and adults, 
identifying one’s weight as being 
overweight is associated with an 
increased risk of future weight 
gain.14, 
30, 
31 In addition, adolescents 
who reported being labeled “fat” by 
family or peers earlier in childhood 
were most likely to gain more weight 
across adolescence.20 Although these 
findings appear counterintuitive, a 
developing body of evidence suggests 
that the stigma attached to the label 
of overweight can be damaging 
and make self-regulation more 
difficult.18, 
32 For example, because 
overweight and obese individuals 
are often stigmatized or derogated 
in popular media, 
33 this may cause 
appearance-based concerns among 
those who identify as overweight 
and be demotivating for exercise.34 
Likewise, experiencing stigma and 
feeling judged negatively because 
of one’s body size is associated 
with disordered eating and 
maladaptive coping responses, such 
as overeating.17, 
35 Whether these 
observations relate to the present 
findings now warrants detailed 
investigation because a number 
of psychological models suggest 
that stigma can be threatening and 
damaging.36, 
37 It is possible that the 
negative connotations attached to 
labeling a child as overweight could 
change the way parents interact 
with their child (eg, providing food 
for comfort) or has an effect on child 
weight-related behaviors, resulting in 
a form of “self-fulfilling prophecy.”31 
In addition, it is conceivable that once 
a child is thought to be overweight, 
his or her parent may be more 
inclined to encourage unhealthy 
dieting behavior, 
38 serve larger 
portions of food, or believe the child’s 
weight precludes him or her from 
some forms of exercise, all of which 
could in theory contribute to weight 
gain. These potential explanations 
are speculative, so further research is 
now needed.
There was also evidence that children 
who were perceived as underweight 
by their parents gained less weight 
than children whose weight was 
perceived as being normal, and this 
association was most pronounced 
among the slimmest of children. 
One explanation of this finding may 
be that parents who were likely to 
identify their child underweight 
did so because they were already 
aware of underlying medical or 
developmental problems that 
contribute to weight loss or reduced 
weight gain during childhood. 
However, we were unable to formally 
test this explanation in the current 
study. Further examination of this 
finding would be valuable.
Strengths of the present work include 
the use of nationally representative 
data and objectively measured 
child weight and height because 
there may be reporting biases that

ROBINSON and SUTIN 
can have an effect on both parental 
reports of child weight and parental 
perceptions of child weight status. 
A limitation of using BMI data (as 
we did in the current study) is 
that there are other more accurate 
measurements of adiposity (eg, body 
composition), although BMI tends 
to be highly correlated with more 
objective measures of adiposity.39 In 
the present research, we were unable 
to examine the causes of parental 
perceptions of overweight or identify 
possible behavioral factors that 
explain how parental perceptions 
of overweight were linked to child 
weight gain, so further work better 
suited to answering these questions 
would be valuable. The present 
findings are also based on data from 
predominantly white Australian 
children and their mothers, so we 
cannot make conclusions about how 
well these findings would generalize 
to other populations or to paternal 
perceptions of weight status. As 
is the case with most longitudinal 
research, there was a degree of 
attrition because children and their 
families were required to remain in 
the study for 8 years. However, it 
should be noted that the results we 
observed when attrition was minimal 
(ie, the association between parental 
perceptions measured at ages 4–5 
years and child weight at 6–7 years 
old) were similar to the results 
observed in the reduced sample size 
at 8-year follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS
A parent identifying that his or 
her child was overweight did not 
act as a protective factor against 
further weight gain; instead, it 
was associated with a greater risk 
of elevated weight gain across 
childhood (measured by using 
BMI z scores). Further research is 
required to understand how parental 
perceptions of child weight status 
may counterintuitively contribute to 
overweight and obesity.
