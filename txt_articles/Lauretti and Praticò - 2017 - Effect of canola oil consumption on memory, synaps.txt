Effect of canola oil consumption 
on memory, synapse and 
neuropathology in the triple 
transgenic mouse model of 
Alzheimer’s disease
Elisabetta Lauretti & Domenico Praticò
In recent years consumption of canola oil has increased due to lower cost compared with olive oil and 
the perception that it shares its health benefits. However, no data are available on the effect of canola 
oil intake on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. Herein, we investigated the effect of chronic daily 
consumption of canola oil on the phenotype of a mouse model of AD that develops both plaques and 
tangles (3xTg). To this end mice received either regular chow or a chow diet supplemented with canola 
oil for 6 months. At this time point we found that chronic exposure to the canola-rich diet resulted 
in a significant increase in body weight and impairments in their working memory together with 
decrease levels of post-synaptic density protein-95, a marker of synaptic integrity, and an increase 
in the ratio of insoluble Aβ
 42/40. No significant changes were observed in tau phosphorylation and 
neuroinflammation. Taken together, our findings do not support a beneficial effect of chronic canola oil 
consumption on two important aspects of AD pathophysiology which includes memory impairments 
as well as synaptic integrity. While more studies are needed, our data do not justify the current trend 
aimed at replacing olive oil with canola oil.
Epidemiological and clinical studies have consistently indicated that higher adherence to the Mediterranean diet is 
associated with a reduced risk of developing mild cognitive impairment and AD, and a reduced risk of progressing 
from mild cognitive impairment to AD1,2. Among the different nutrients that characterize the Mediterranean diet, a 
lot of attention has been focused on the daily intake of olive oil as the main source of added fat, which is estimated to 
be quite high in the Mediterranean area populations compared with other geographical regions around the world3,4.
There is no doubt that promoting olive oil consumption in non-Mediterranean populations could be a dif-
ficult task in part for the fact that this ingredient is generally more expensive than other cooking oils. Rapeseed 
oil (known also as canola oil) has emerged as a potential substitute for olive oil since has a similar monounsatu-
rated fatty acids content to that of olive oil and an overall favorable fatty acid profile5. As result, in recent years 
the consumption of canola oil has significantly increased in non-Mediterranean countries, due to the lower cost 
compared with olive oil and the perception that it shares the health benefits of the olive oil6,7.
Today canola oil is the third largest vegetable oil by volume after palm and soybean oil worldwide, and in the 
United States is one of the most widely used oil for human consumption second only to soybean oil8. While many 
studies have investigated the relationship between olive oil with disease incidence, mortality and biomarkers 
for diseases, studies with canola oil are mainly focused only to biomarkers. Limited and not conclusive scien-
tific evidence would suggest some benefit for canola oil consumption, but results from studies implementing 
diets containing canola oil in experimental animal models have provided us with conflicting data9,10. On the 
other hand, studies have consistently demonstrated a beneficial effect of olive oil in different mouse models of 
neurodegeneration11–13. A diet rich in olive oil reduced parenchymal and vascular Aβ
 levels in a model of brain 
amyloidosis, TgSwDI14, and Aβ
 and tau neuropthaology together with an and improvement of behavioral deficits

in the triple transgenic mice (3xTg)15. By contrast, no data are available on the effect that canola oil consumption 
may have on any of these models and the development of their phenotypes. For this reason, in the present paper 
we assessed the biological effect of chronic administration of a canola oil-rich diet on the 3xTg mice, which are 
known to develop both amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles16.
Results
Effect of canola oil on animal body weight. 
At the beginning of the study, mice randomized to regular 
diet or canola rich diet did not differ in terms of total body weight: 27.49 ± 0.88 gr (Control); 27.66 ± 1.12 gr 
(Canola oil). By the end of the study, when the mice were 12 months old, the group on the regular chow had 
an average body weight of 31.88 ± 0.91 gr, whereas the one receiving canola oil had a significantly much higher 
weight of 37.71 ± 1.24 gr (p < 0.01) (Supplemental Fig. 1).
Influence of canola oil-rich diet on behavior in 3xTg mice. 
To determine the effect of canola oil-rich 
diet on behavior, at the end of the treatment animals were tested in 3 different paradigms: Y-maze, fear condi-
tioning and Morris water maze. As shown in Fig. 1A, in the Y-maze, compared with control group mice receiving 
the canola rich diet showed a small increase in the number of entries that did not reach statistical significance. By 
contrast, when we assessed the percentage of alternation, we found that chronic canola oil treatment resulted in 
statistically significant lower percentage in this parameter when compared with control mice (Fig. 1A).
Next, mice underwent fear conditioning testing. No significant differences between the two groups were 
observed in the freezing time during the training session (not shown). However, while no changes between the 
two groups were noted in the contextual recall phase, a trend toward reduction in freezing time was observed for 
the canola oil group in the cued recall phase of this paradigm (Fig. 1B).
Finally, animals were tested in the Morris water-maze paradigm. All mice in each group were able to reach the 
training criterion within 4 days and no differences were found during the training session (not shown). During 
the probe test we observed that compared with controls, mice receiving the canola oil did not manifest any sig-
nificant difference for the number of entries in the platform zone and time spent in the platform zone (Fig. 1C). 
No significant differences were observed in both paradigms when males and females were analyzed separately.
Effect of canola oil supplementation on brain amyloidosis. 
At 12 months of age, mice were eutha-
nized and brain cortex homogenates assayed for Aβ
 levels in the RIPA-soluble and formic acid-soluble fractions. 
Compared with controls, we found that canola oil group did not manifest any significant differences in the levels 
of RIPA-soluble Aβ
 1-40 and Aβ
 1-42, and that this was also true for the formic acid- soluble fraction of the Aβ
 
1-42 (Fig. 2A). However, canola oil treated mice had a significant reduction in the formic acid-soluble fraction of 
the Aβ
 1-40 levels (Fig. 2A). An analysis of the Aβ
 42/40 ratios for the RIPA-soluble fractions did not reveal any 
changes between the treated and control mice (Fig. 2B). By contrast, compared with control group mice receiving 
the canola oil-rich diet had a significant increase for the ratios of the Aβ
 42/40 in the formic acid-soluble fraction 
(Fig. 2B). Next, we investigated the effect of canola oil on Aβ
 deposition by immunohistochemistry. While no sta-
tistically significant differences were observed between the two groups, we noticed that compared with controls 
canola oil-treated mice had a trend toward an increase in the immunoreactivity for Aβ
 deposits, which did not 
reach statistical significance (Fig. 2C).
To investigate possible effect of the active treatment on APP metabolism next we assayed the levels of the Aβ
 
precursor protein (APP) and the proteases involved in its cleavage by Western blot. Compared with controls, no 
changes in the levels of all proteins investigated were observed when the canola oil group was compared with control 
mice (i.e., APP, BACE1, ADAM10, Nicastrin, Pen 2, PS1, APH1) (Fig. 2D,E). Finally, we looked at some of the pro-
teins that have been involved in Aβ
 clearance, but no significant differences were found between the two groups in 
the levels of apolipoprotein E (APOE), neprilysin (CD10) and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) (Fig. 2D,E). No dif-
ferences were observed in any of the parameters above described when males and females were analyzed separately.
Effect of canola oil rich-diet on tau phosphorylation. 
Next, we investigated the effect of chronic can-
ola oil-rich diet consumption on tau protein levels and phosphorylation in the brain cortices of the same mice. 
Compared with controls, no significant effect of the treatment was observed when the levels of total tau were 
assessed (Fig. 3A,B). In a similar manner, no changes were also observed between the two groups of mice when 
we assessed the levels of tau phosphorylated at the following epitopes: ser202/thr205, t231/s235, and thr181 as 
recognized by the antibodies AT8, AT180 and AT270 respectively (Fig. 3A,B).
Effect of canola oil-rich diet on synaptic proteins and neuroinflammation. 
To assess whether the 
effect on the behavior response we observed in the canola oil-treated mice was also biochemically characterized 
by a change in synaptic integrity, we assayed the levels of two major synaptic proteins: synaptophysin (SYP) indi-
ces of pre-synaptic integrity, and the postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95). As shown in Fig. 4, no differences 
were observed between the two groups when SYP levels were measured. By contrast, mice fed with canola oil-rich 
diet when compared with the control group displayed a statistically significant decrease in the levels of PSD95 
protein (Fig. 4A,B). Confirming the immunoblot data, canola-treated mice showed a significant decrease in brain 
immunoreactivity for this synaptic protein (Fig. 4C).
Next we assessed whether two well-established markers of neuroinflammation were influenced by the dietary reg-
imen. Compared with controls, mice receiving the canola oil-rich diet did not show any significant differences in the 
levels of GFAP
, a marker of astrocytes activation, and IBA1, a marker of microglia activation (Fig. 4D,E). No significant 
differences were observed in any of the parameters above described when males and females were analyzed separately.
Effect of canola oil-rich diet on CREB signaling on 3xTg mice. 
Since CREB and CREB-regulated 
proteins have been previously reported to be altered in AD pathology, next we investigated the effect of the

canola oil-rich diet on total CREB levels and its phosphorylated form at Ser133 (pCREB). As shown in Fig. 5, the 
levels of total CREB and pCREB were not changed in the brains of canola oil-treated mice compared to controls. 
Additionally, no differences between the two groups were detected for the expression levels of c-Fos and brain 
derived neutrophic factor (BDNF), two important CREB target genes (Fig. 5A,B).
Effect of canola oil-rich diet on autophagy in 3xTg mice. 
Finally, since other vegetable oils such as 
olive oil have been reported to influence autophagy markers, next we wanted to assess whether this was also the 
case for canola oil. Among the autophagy markres, we assessed autophagy protein 5 (Agt5), Atg5/12, Atg7 and the 
microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 conversion (LC3BI/II) which are considered essential for the auto-
phagosome formation and autophagic flux, respectively17,18. Compared with the control group, mice receiving the 
canola oil-rich diet did not manifest any significant differences in the steady state levels of Agt5, Atg5/12, Atg7, as 
well as LC3BI/II conversion ratio (Fig. 5C,D).

Discussion
The data presented in the current paper demonstrate that chronic administration of a diet enriched with canola 
oil results in significant deficits of working memory and synaptic pathology, but has no effect on the Aβ
 deposits 
and tau phosphorylation levels in a transgenic Alzheimer’s mouse model that develops Aβ
 deposits and tau neu-
rofibrillary tangles.
Increasing evidence has been accumulated showing that nutritional factors can influence diverse aspects of 
general health by modulating specific biological systems19. Thus, over the past two decades substantial research 
has recognized that chronic exposure to the Mediterranean diet is beneficial with respect to reducing the inci-
dence of cardiovascular diseases, and metabolic syndrome20. In addition, longitudinal and prospective clini-
cal trials have revealed that higher adherence to this type of diet is associated with slower rates of cognitive

decline, reduced conversion to AD, and improvement of cognitive function21,22. Among the key elements of the 
Mediterranean diet, an important role has been attributed to daily intake of fresh fruits and vegetables, and the 
usage of olive oil as a primary source of fat23. In particular, regular daily olive oil consumption has been suggested 
as the most important and integral component of the diet, and as having a major role in the health benefit of this 
diet24,25.
This concept has been the propeller for some health organizations in non-Mediterranean countries to pro-
mote a Mediterranean diet and the usage of olive oil as the main source of dietary fat. However, this policy has 
not always been very successful since adopting this type of oil could be more expensive in comparison with other 
cooking oils in these populations. For this reason, in recent years these countries have been looking for potential 
alternative to the olive oil. Among them, canola oil has gained increasing attention as a suitable substitute to olive 
oil especially in countries that lack the primary source for it: the olive tree. As result, canola oil consumption is 
now quite high in many of these countries because of its lower price compared with olive oil, but also and most 
importantly because there is a diffuse perception that the canola oil is a healthy choice.
Most of the studies so far investigating the relationship between canola oil consumption and health benefits 
have shown limited evidence of beneficial effects or neutral action on biomarkers of risk factors for cardiovas-
cular diseases26. On the other hand, studies have provided conflicting results depending on the experimental 
model implemented, the length of the treatment and the particular end-point considered27,28. However, no data 
are available on the biological effects that chronic exposure to dietary canola oil may have on cognitive function 
and the development of the AD-like phenotype which typically include: memory, synaptic integrity, Aβ
 and tau 
neuropathology.
To address this scientific question, we implemented a dietary approach and utilized a transgenic mouse model, 
the 3xTg mice, which manifest all these aspects including memory impairments, Aβ
 deposits and tau tangles 
pathology16.
First, we observed that compared with 3xTg mice receiving regular chow diet, the group treated with canola 
oil-rich diet had a significant increase in body weight suggesting that the added oil provided extra calories to the 
mice. This observation is in contrast with previous reports showing that chronic diet supplementation with canola 
oil had no effect on the average animal body weight28,29. We interpret this discrepancy as secondary to the differ-
ent strains of mice that were implemented in those studies, and probably the length of our study.
However, this fact did not translate in any alteration of their motor ability since we did not observe any differ-
ences between the two groups when for instance the animals were tested in the different behavioral paradigms. 
Thus, in the Y-maze no significant differences were observed between the two groups when the number of entries 
in each arm of the maze was considered suggesting that the diet and the higher body weight did not alter the 
motor ability of the mice. By contrast, compared with 3xTg kept on a regular chow diet, the ones receiving canola 
oil-supplemented diet had a significant reduction in the percentage of spontaneous alternations in the Y-maze, 
suggesting an impairment of their working memory30.
Supporting the detrimental effect of chronic exposure to canola oil-rich diet on the behavior responses, we 
found that the same mice had biochemical evidence for a reduction in synaptic integrity as demonstrated by 
the significantly lower levels of PSD95 protein, a well-established synaptic marker, in the brains of the canola 
oil-treated mice31.
Analysis of the amount of Aβ
 1-40 and Aβ
 1-42 peptides in the soluble fractions from brain cortices of these 
mice did not show any significant differences between the two groups. A similar result was obtained when we 
assayed the formic acid soluble fraction of the Aβ
 1-42 peptides. By contrast, we observed that brain samples from 
mice treated with the canola oil had a significant reduction the formic acid soluble fraction of Aβ
 1-40 peptides, 
which is considered less prone to precipitate and form insoluble deposits compared to the Aβ
 1-42 peptides32. 
Normally Aβ
 1-40 is produced at higher levels, but as Aβ
 1-42 is more hydrophobic and has a stronger tendency 
to polymerize into neurotoxic species, it seems to be of particular importance in AD pathogenesis33,34. This is 
supported by studies on mutations in APP, presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and PSEN2, which show an increased Aβ
 42/40 
ratio35. Interestingly, an analysis of the ratios among the two fractions of Aβ
 peptides revealed that the brains of 
the mice receiving canola oil had a statistically significant increase in the ratios of Aβ
 42/40 suggesting a shift 
towards the more prone to fibril formation and insoluble form of these peptides, which would favor their progres-
sive precipitation and intracellular accumulation.
This observation has great biologic importance, since data in the literature have shown that from a mecha-
nistic point of view elevation in Aβ
 42/40 peptide ratio enhances the nucleation and fibrillogenesis of pathogenic 
Aβ
 1-42 peptides, events that are otherwise compromised by the presence of high levels of secreted Aβ
 1-40 
peptides36. Confirming this aspect of the Aβ
 peptides neurobiology, we found a trend towards an increase in the 
amount of Aβ
 deposits immunoreactivity in the brains of the canola oil-treated mice compared with controls.
No significant effect of the canola oil-rich diet was found on some of the major protein systems in place to 
control Aβ
 clearance and degradation. Thus, steady state levels of apoE, a major Aβ
 chaperone, levels of neprilysin 
and IDE, two major Aβ
 catabolic pathways, were no different between the controls and canola oil-treated mice.
Since this model is known to develop high levels of phosphorylated tau protein and ultimately forms neurofi-
brillary tangles, next we were very interested in assessing whether our dietary treatment had any influence on this 
aspect of their phenotype. By the end of the chronic treatment, levels of total soluble tau and different phospho-
rylated isoforms were undistinguishable between the two groups, suggesting that canola oil does not influence 
tau metabolism.
Since previous works have shown that olive oil has a potent anti-inflammatory action in vivo, next we assessed 
the effect of chronic canola oil exposure on classical biomarkers of activation for microglia and astrocytes, two 
major cellular components and modulators of neuroinflammatory responses37. Brain homogenates from canola 
oil treated mice were not different from the ones receiving chow diet controls when the steady state levels of 
GFAP, a marker of astrocytosis, and IBA1, a marker of microglia activation, were measured.

Finally, since we previously reported that olive oil is an activator in vivo of the autophagic machinery15, we 
also investigated whether or not this was the case in the mice receiving the canola oil-rich diet. Assessment of 
several well-established markers of autophagy activation in the brain of the two groups of mice did not show any 
significant differences, suggesting that canola oil does not influence this system38.
In conclusion, our investigation demonstrates for the first time to the best of our knowledge a negative effect 
of the chronic consumption of canola oil on memory, synaptic integrity and Aβ
 42/40 ratios in a mouse model of 
AD. The translational value of our findings lies in the observation that this type of oil supplementation can influ-
ence some of the most important features of the AD pathological phenotype.
Overall our findings do not provide support to some of the current ideas suggesting healthy benefits deriving 
from the regular consumption of canola oil. Although we recognize that more studies are needed to investigate 
the biological effects of this oil, our data would not justify the increasing tendency of replacing olive oil with can-
ola oil as part of a good and healthy dietary alternative in non-Mediterranean countries.
Methods and Materials
Animals and treatment. 
The study was approved by the Temple Institutional Animal Care and Usage 
Committee, in accordance with the US National Institutes of Health guidelines. The 3xTg mice harboring 3 trans-
genes (PS1 M146V, tau P301L, and APP Swe) were used in this study16. For the study we used both male and female 
mice. Six-month old mice were randomized into two groups: one fed with standard diet (CTR, n = 12), the other 
with canola oil-enriched diet (50 mg/Kg) (CO, n = 10) for 6 months. The control mice used in this study have 
been previously described15. The source of the canola oil added to the diet was “Mazola®” canola oil, which con-
tains 21% total fat (1gr saturated fatty acids, 4gr polyunsaturated fatty acids, and 8 gr of monounsaturated fatty 
acids per serving). Fresh diet was provided every other day. Mice underwent behavioral tests at 12 months (6 
months treatment) of age as described below and a week later euthanized. After perfusion, brains were removed 
and immediately dissected in two halves: one was stored at −
80 °C for biochemistry; the other fixed in 4% para-
formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pH7.4 for immunohistochemistry.
Behavioral tests. 
All the animals were handled for at least 3–4 consecutive days before testing, and tests 
were performed in a blind fashion without knowledge of treatment by the investigator.
Y-maze. 
The Y-maze apparatus consisted of 3 arms, 32 cm (long) 610 cm (wide) with 26-cm walls (San Diego 
Instruments, San Diego, CA). The test was performed as previously described in details in our publications39,40.

 19 cm) 
equipped with black methacrylate walls, transparent front door, a speaker, and grid floor (Start Fear System; 
Harvard Apparatus) as previously described in our publications39.
Morris water maze. 
The test was performed following our published protocol which uses circular pool filled 
with water maintained at 22° +/−
2 °C, and made opaque by the addition of a nontoxic white paint. Mice were 
given four daily trials for four consecutive days, and on the fifth day a probe trial was administered as previously 
described in details in our papers39–41.
Immunoblot analyses. 
Immunoblot analyses were performed as previously described39–41. Briefly, proteins 
were extracted in enzyme immunoassay buffer containing 250 mM Tris base, 750 mM NaCl, 5% NP-40, 25 mM 
EDTA, 2.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate and an EDTA-free protease and phosphatase 
inhibitors cocktail tablet (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA), sonicated, centrifuged at 45 000 r.p.m. 
for 45 min at 4 °C, and supernatants used for immunoblot analysis, as previously described39–41.
Biochemical analysis. 
Brain homogenates were sequentially extracted first in RIPA buffer and then in for-
mic acid for the measurement of Aβ
 1-40 and Aβ
 1-42 peptide levels as previously described39–42.
Immunohistochemistry. 
Primary antibodies used in this study are listed in Table 1. Immunostaining was 
performed using serial 6-μ
m thick coronal sections, as reported previously in details39–42. Consecutives sections 
were incubated in the absence of primary antibodies to ensure specificity of staining.
Data analysis. 
Unpaired Student’s t-test (two-sided) and one-way ANOVA were performed using Prism 5.0 
(GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA). All data are presented as mean ± s.e.m. Significance was set at P < 0.05.
Availability of data and materials.
