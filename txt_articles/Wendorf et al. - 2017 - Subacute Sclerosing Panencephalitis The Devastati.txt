Background. Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a fatal complication of measles. We reviewed California cases from 
1998–2015 to understand risk factors for SPPE and estimate incidence.
Methods. SSPE cases had clinically compatible symptoms and measles antibody detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or med-
ical record documentation of SSPE. Cases were identified though a state death certificate search, Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention reports, or investigations for undiagnosed neurologic disease. Measles detection in CSF was performed by serology at the 
California Department of Public Health or at clinical laboratories.
Results. Seventeen SSPE cases were identified. Males outnumbered females 2.4:1. Twelve (71%) cases had a history of mea-
sles-like illness; all 12 had illness prior to 15 months of age. Eight (67%) children were exposed to measles in California. SSPE was 
diagnosed at a median age of 12 years (3–35 years), with a latency period of 9.5 years (2.5–34 years). Among measles cases reported 
to CDPH during 1988–1991, the incidence of SSPE was 1:1367 for children <5 years, and 1:609 for children <12 months at time of 
measles disease.
Conclusions. SSPE cases in California occurred at a high rate among unvaccinated children, particularly those infected during 
infancy. Protection of unvaccinated infants requires avoidance of travel to endemic areas, or early vaccination prior to travel at age 
6–11 months. Clinicians should be aware of SSPE in patients with compatible symptoms, even in older patients with no specific 
history of measles infection. SSPE demonstrates the high human cost of “natural” measles immunity.

Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a rare, fatal com-
plication of measles characterized by cognitive and motor dete-
rioration, with death typically occurring within 1–3 years of 
symptom onset [1].
Prior to measles vaccination programs, the incidence of SSPE 
in developed countries was estimated at 1 case per 100 000 pop-
ulation, but was 100 times higher in some developing nations, 
suggesting that environmental or genetic factors or specific mea-
sles genotypes might be risk factors. A consistent SSPE risk fac-
tor has been measles infection before the second birthday [1].
Measles vaccine prevents measles infection, thereby pre-
venting SSPE. Vaccine-strain measles virus has not been 
demonstrated in SSPE [2]. Following implementation of effec-
tive measles vaccination programs, the incidence of SSPE 
decreased markedly [3, 4]. Studies suggest that the risk of SSPE 
is higher among persons infected with measles at a young 
age. During the 1989–1991 measles resurgence in the United 
States, SSPE risk was calculated as 1:4635; however, due to likely 
underreporting of measles cases, the true risk was thought to 
be about half this estimate [2]. More recently, the SSPE risk was 
estimated at approximately 1:5560 in England and Wales for 
children infected before age 1 year [5] and as high as 1:1700 in 
Germany for children infected before age 5 years [6].
Although endemic measles transmission has been eliminated in 
North and South America and Australia, measles is still endemic 
in much of the world [7]. Therefore, US cases and outbreaks con-
tinue to occur related to international travel. A recent outbreak 
associated with a California theme park infected >125 people [8].
We describe the epidemiology and risk factors associated 
with SSPE cases diagnosed in California during 1998–2015 
and identified by the California Department of Public Health 
(CDPH).

METHODS
Cases meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC) SSPE definition were included. These cases had a clin-
ically compatible illness with either elevated measles antibody 
detection in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or typical histologic find-
ings in brain biopsy [9]. Persons hospitalized with a clinically 
compatible illness and medical record documentation of SSPE-
related complications were also included.
Cases were identified by 3 methods: (1) testing performed by 
the CDPH Encephalitis Project for patients with unexplained 
neurologic illness; (2) review of 1998–2014 California death 
certificate data for SSPE reported as a cause of death; and (3) 
notification by CDC of patients with brain biopsies in which 
measles RNA or antigen was detected. All cases were verified by 
medical record review.
Available CSF and serum samples were evaluated for immu-
noglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to measles virus. IgG detection 
was performed using an in-house indirect enzyme immunoassay 
at the CDPH Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory (VRDL) 
[10] or by immunofluorescence assay at clinical laboratories. 
A subset of cases was also tested for IgG antibodies to herpes 
simplex virus to assess integrity of the blood–brain barrier [11].
RESULTS
Demographics
Nineteen possible SSPE cases were identified; 11 (58%) through 
physician requests for testing of patients with undiagnosed neu-
rologic disease, 7 (37%) through death certificate review, and 
1 (5%) reported by CDC. Two cases whose death certificates 
included SSPE as a cause of death, but for whom SSPE could 
not be verified via medical records, were excluded from further 
analysis. Five cases have previously been reported [11]; 2 cases 
were published as case reports [12, 13].
Seventeen cases of SSPE met the case definition and were 
included. Cases were born between 1976 and 2011. Males 
(n = 12) outnumbered females 2.4:1. Seven (41%) cases were 
Asian/Pacific Islander, 6 (35%) Hispanic, and 4 (24%) were 
White non-Hispanic. Eight (47%) were born in the United 
States, and 8 (47%) were born abroad (Table 1). Country of 
birth was unknown for 1 case.
Measles History
Twelve (71%) cases had a history of measles infection or a 
compatible febrile rash illness prior to SSPE diagnosis. Of the 
remaining 5 cases, 3 (18%) had no history of previous febrile 
rash illness, and measles history was unknown for 2 (12%) cases.
All 12 cases with a history of febrile rash illness were ill 
prior to age 15 months. Five (42%) cases were infected at age 
6 months or younger, and an additional 6 (50%) cases were 
infected before age 12 months. One (8%) case had reported 
infection at age 14 months.
Of these 12 cases, 8 (67%) were residents of California at the 
time of infection, 7 of whom were thought to have been infected 
in California. Two cases were reportedly exposed to measles 
during known outbreaks in California. Four cases were pre-
sumed exposed to measles in California because they were born 
in California, lived in California at the time of SSPE diagnosis, 
and had no reported international travel prior to measles diag-
nosis. One case was born outside the United States, but immi-
grated to California several months prior to being hospitalized 
for measles in California. The final case (eighth California resi-
dent) had traveled to Germany immediately preceding measles 
infection (Figure 1), and was found to be infected with a mea-
sles genotype (D4) circulating in Europe at the time of expo-
sure. Of note, a ninth case with no history of febrile rash illness 
was born in the United States in 1989 and had no international 
travel prior to SSPE diagnosis, suggesting measles exposure and 
infection in the United States, although age at the time of infec-
tion is unknown.
Of the 4 cases who were known not to be infected in the 
United States, 3 (25%) were infected while living in their country 
of birth outside the United States (Table 1); measles is endemic 
in all of these countries. Genotyping was performed on a case 
thought to have been exposed in India and the genotype (D7) 
was compatible with strains likely circulating in India at that 
time. The country of birth and location of measles exposure was 
unknown for 1 (8%) case.
All 7 cases exposed in California were likely exposed during 
a measles resurgence between 1988 and 1991 (Figure 1) when 
9564 measles cases were reported in children <5 years of age 
in California (unpublished surveillance data); 7 SSPE cases 
were infected in California before age 5 years during this time, 
resulting in an SSPE case rate of 1:1367 for children infected 
with measles before age 5 years. Six of the 7 (86%) California-
acquired SSPE cases occurred in children who had measles 
infection prior to age 12 months. Between 1988 and 1991, 
3651 cases of measles among children <12 months of age were 
reported in California (unpublished surveillance data), result-
ing in an SSPE case rate of 1:609 for children infected with 
measles prior to age 12 months. Of these 7 cases, 3 (43%) were 
Hispanic, and 2 (28.5%) each were Asian/Pacific Islander and 
white non-Hispanic.
There was no evidence that any case received measles vacci-
nation prior to measles infection. Of the 12 cases with a history 
of a febrile rash illness, none of 6 (50%) cases with documented 
vaccination status at time of infection had received measles vac-
cine prior to infection. Among the 6 cases with undocumented 
measles vaccination status at time of infection, 2 (29%) were age 
6 months or younger when infected with measles and were too 
young to have been vaccinated prior to infection. Three (43%) 
were infected with measles prior to age 12 months and were 
unlikely to have been vaccinated. Two lived in countries (United 
States and Mexico) that recommend routinely administering

measles-containing vaccine no earlier than 1 year of age (although 
vaccine can be administered to infants aged 6–11 months if 
international travel is planned), and the third case lived in the 
Philippines and was infected with measles at age 8 months, before 
that country’s routine vaccination age of 9 months. Finally, one 
US-born child had undocumented vaccination status at the time 
of measles infection at 14 months, which was within the routine 
timeframe for first measles vaccination (12–15 months); how-
ever, some pediatric practices routinely administer the first dose 
of measles-containing vaccine at 15 months (Table 2).
Of the 5 (29%) cases with no history of measles infection, 2 
(40%) had unknown immunization status at the time of SSPE 
diagnosis and 2 (40%) were unimmunized. One case (20%) was 
unlikely to have received measles-containing vaccine, as only 2 
unknown type vaccinations prior to age 9 years were reported.
SSPE Diagnosis
The median age at presentation was 12 years (range, 3–35 
years). The latency period between measles infection and SSPE 
diagnosis was known for 12 cases; the median was 9.5 years 
(range, 2.5–34 years). All cases presented to care because of the 
abrupt onset of new neurologic symptoms. However, the major-
ity of cases also had long-standing cognitive or motor problems 
that could have represented early SSPE symptoms (Table 1).

One patient presented with symptoms during the third trimes-
ter of her pregnancy. Early in the course of SSPE, most cases 
(11 [65%]) had abnormal motor symptoms including jerking 
movements, seizures, tremors, poor coordination, ataxia, or 
weakness. Nine (53%) had behavior problems including inat-
tention, hyperactivity, lethargy, language problems, poor school 
performance, forgetfulness, or staring spells.
Ultimately, all cases developed cognitive and motor decline. 
Eleven (65%) had myoclonic jerks at some point in their disease 
course. Ten (59%) cases are deceased, 1 (6%) case born in 2011 
is alive at this time, and 6 (35%) were lost to follow-up.
Fifteen cases had measles virus IgG antibodies detected in 
CSF (Table 2). Both cases without available measles antibody 
results had compatible histories and were reported as con-
firmed SSPE cases per their medical records. Enzyme immuno-
assay tests performed at CDPH VRDL on 10 cases were positive 
for measles virus IgG in both serum and CSF. To demonstrate 
that the measles virus–specific IgG detected in CSF was likely 
due to intrathecal antibody production, concurrent testing for 
herpes simplex virus (HSV) IgG antibodies was performed on 
7 of these 10 cases. HSV IgG results were positive in serum but 
negative in CSF, suggesting that the positive CSF measles virus 
IgG findings were due to intrathecal antibody production. Five 
of the 15 cases were measles virus IgG positive in CSF by immu-
nofluorescence assay at clinical laboratories. Two cases under-
went genotyping at CDC; one was genotype D4, the other D7 
(Table 2).
CSF profiles at the time of SSPE diagnosis were available for 
12 cases; all were relatively normal (Table 2). EEG reports were 
available for 16 cases; all were abnormal. Magnetic resonance 
imaging reports were obtained for 13 cases and ranged from 
normal to severe generalized atrophy (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Measles virus continues to circulate in much of the world 
[14], and this case series highlights the importance of measles 
prevention. Measles vaccination reduces the risk of measles 
infection and SSPE [2]. Because infants infected with measles 
are at highest risk for SSPE, it is important that they are pro-
tected against measles by vaccination and herd immunity [4]. 
Although the first dose of measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) 
vaccine is routinely recommended at age 12–15 months in the 
United States, CDC recommends that infants aged 6–11 months 
receive 1 dose of MMR vaccine, and children aged ≥12 months 
receive 2 doses prior to international travel [7]. Because 5%–7% 
of individuals are not protected after 1 dose, parents might 
choose to avoid endemic areas until their child has received 2 
doses of vaccine; a second dose can be given as early as 4 weeks 
after the first dose.
In our case series, all cases with known measles onset dates 
were infected before 12–15 months of age, when most US-born 
children are not yet vaccinated. Some children were born in 
measles-endemic countries and were likely infected with mea-
sles before moving to the United States. Because there are cur-
rently more cases of measles outside the United States than 
within, it is more likely that US-born children will be exposed to 
measles during international travel. However, recently 20 unim-
munized infants 15 months of age or younger were infected 
during a measles outbreak associated with a California theme 
park (unpublished surveillance data) [8]. Because measles can 
be introduced into the United States at any time, reducing the 
risk of measles and subsequent SSPE for US infants requires 
sustaining high levels of immunization domestically while con-
tinuing efforts to eliminate the disease where it is still endemic. 
As long as measles continues to circulate in the world, measles 
infection can occur in unvaccinated infants who have an ele-
vated risk of SSPE.
SSPE diagnosis is often not made because of the prolonged 
period between measles infection and the onset of neurologi-
cal symptoms. Several of our cases had no known history of a 
febrile rash illness, although the SSPE diagnosis indicates that 
a subclinical or undiagnosed infection occurred [2]; subclini-
cal disease might be more common in young infants [15]. Two 
of our cases had particularly long latency periods (>25 years). 
One patient with history of cerebral palsy, seizures, and devel-
opmental delay since childhood was not evaluated for SSPE 
until age 35, when a tremor and notable decline in mental status 
occurred over a period of a few weeks to months. The second 
patient was previously healthy with possible preceding “mental 
slowness” and was evaluated for SSPE at age 29 after developing 
lower limb weakness during the third trimester of pregnancy. 
Initial evaluation showed rigidity, hyperreflexia, and positive 
Babinski sign, and a subsequent rapid decline in mental sta-
tus. SSPE diagnosis during pregnancy has been reported in the 
literature, suggesting that the altered immune system during 
pregnancy might permit the virus, if present, to replicate in the 
central nervous system [13, 16].
SSPE cases can also be missed because measles history is 
often not obtained unless SSPE is specifically considered as 
part of the differential diagnosis. If no known measles infec-
tion occurred, or if the child was vaccinated, SSPE might not be 
considered or quickly disregarded. One case of SSPE was diag-
nosed in a young child who was hospitalized with a mild febrile 
rash illness with cough and coryza in infancy, but who had not 
been suspected to have measles. To correctly diagnose SSPE, 
clinicians must maintain a high level of suspicion based on the 
patient’s clinical presentation and the likelihood of exposure to 
measles. Once considered, SSPE is generally a simple diagnosis 
to make, requiring only CSF antibody testing that can be per-
formed in public health and clinical laboratories [11].
All SSPE cases exposed to measles in the United States were 
exposed in California during a measles resurgence between 
1988 and 1991. During this time, >55 000 cases of measles

were reported in the United States, including >18 000 cases in 
California (unpublished surveillance data) [17, 18]. Children 
<5 years of age had the highest incidence of measles during this 
time period, particularly unvaccinated racial and ethnic minor-
ity children, and complications occurred in 20.5% of cases at 
the time of infection [18, 19]. Our SSPE case rate of 1:1367 for 
children <5 years of age at the time of measles infection dur-
ing 1988–1991 is similar to the recent report from Germany 
[6]. More importantly, 6 (86%) of the 7 SSPE cases who were 
exposed in California had measles infection when they were 
<12 months of age, resulting in a case rate of 1:609 for children 
who were infected with measles prior to age 12 months, which 
is the highest rate reported in the literature. However, these cal-
culations could have been affected by underreporting of both 
measles and SSPE cases. A few articles attempted to quantify the 
degree of nonreporting during this time period. In New York, 
total reporting of measles cases to public health was estimated 
at 45% from 12 hospitals [20]. In Los Angeles, hospital-based 
measles reporting during 1989 was estimated to be 51% [21]. 
Reporting was less sensitive (29%) based on parents’ self-re-
ported recall of a child’s unverified measles illness, but was con-
sistent with the previous studies (48%–63%) among children 
with a measles diagnosis or medical record documentation of 
compatible symptoms and/or with an epidemiologic link to 
another case [22]. Overall, measles reporting improved during 
the epidemic [22]. Because measles reporting relies on clinical 
suspicion, physician recognition of illness is more likely when 
outbreaks are well publicized, as occurred during this epidemic 
[23]. Using the 1989 Los Angeles reporting rate of about 50%, a 
conservative estimate brings our rates of SSPE closer to 1:2700 
for children infected before age 5 years, and 1:1200 for infants 
infected before age 1 year, which is still higher than has been 
previously published. However, this calculation does not take 
into account the underdiagnosis of SSPE, the nonreportable sta-
tus of SSPE, nor cases that might have occurred in patients who 
left California prior to SSPE diagnosis. If the true number of 
SSPE cases is also larger, rates would be closer to our initial cal-
culations. For example, a child born in 1989, whose family had 
no recollection of measles disease, who never left the country, 
but later developed SSPE was excluded from our rate calcula-
tions; the child was likely infected with measles during infancy 
at the height of the outbreak in California.
This case series has several limitations. SSPE cases were iden-
tified primarily though physician requests for testing of patients 
with neurological disease of unknown etiology; in most cases 
SSPE was not suspected. Cases were also identified through 
death certificate review. These methods, while specific for SSPE 
identification, are likely to underestimate the actual number of 
SSPE cases. Medical records were not available for all cases, par-
ticularly less recent cases, so some identified SSPE cases had to 
be excluded from further analysis. Neither cases nor their fam-
ilies were interviewed for this series, and thus clinical history 
was based on medical record review. Additionally, antibody 
titer results from clinical laboratories were reported, but specific 
testing parameters are unknown.
SSPE is a devastating condition that is more common among 
children infected with measles at a young age than has been pre-
viously estimated. All SSPE cases in California during the past 
2 decades occurred among persons who had measles infection 
before the age of 15 months. Avoidance of travel to endemic 
areas can reduce but not eliminate risk, particularly for infants 
<6 months of age. Older infants and children should receive 
early doses of MMR vaccine prior to international travel. 
Clinicians should be aware of the possibility of SSPE as a diag-
nosis even in adult patients or patients without specific history 
of measles infection. Finally, this case series demonstrates the 
potentially high human cost of “natural” measles immunity.
