Introduction
Obesity in children, defined by a body mass 
index (BMI) greater than or equal to the 95th 
percentile for age and sex, is an epidemic of 
great concern in the United States. According 
to the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation 
(RWJF), childhood obesity rates (ages 
2–19 years) have more than tripled between 
the years 1980 and 2010 (RWJF 2012). Long-
term risks of childhood obesity include meta-
bolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular 
disease, and reduced adult life expectancy, with 
children of minority status at greater risk for 
becoming obese (Shaibi et al. 2007; Singh 
et al. 2010; Strauss and Pollack 2001). The 
2007–2008 overall prevalence of obesity and 
overweight was 20.3% and 17.6% for New 
York City (NYC) public school children, with 
African American and Hispanic having higher 
odds than white children of being obese [odds 
ratio (OR) = 1.11; 95% confidence interval 
(CI): 1.07, 1.15 and OR = 1.48; 95% CI: 
1.43, 1.53, respectively] (Rundle et al. 2012). 
Early-life exposure to endocrine disruptors, 
such as bisphenol A (BPA), may be contrib-
uting to the obesity epidemic (Grün and 
Blumberg 2006). Endocrine disruptors may 
also lead to altered metabolic regulation early 
in life (Chevalier and Fénichel 2015).
BPA is a known endocrine-disrupting 
chemical and a key component in poly-
carbonate plastics and epoxy resins that 
are commonly used in consumer products, 
resulting in significant human exposure 
(Calafat et al. 2008; Vandenberg et al. 2007, 
2010). Exposure pathways include oral, 
dermal, and inhalation, with dietary intake 
the primary route (Wilson et al. 2003; Zalko 
et al. 2011). Prenatal exposure may occur 
in utero or by use of catheters during delivery 
(Ikezuki et al. 2002; Schönfelder et al. 2002; 
Vandentorren et al. 2011).
Cross-sectional studies suggest that BPA 
exposure is associated with obesity in children 
(Bhandari et al. 2013; Eng et al. 2013; Li et al. 
2013; Trasande et al. 2012; Wang et al. 2012; 
Wells et al. 2014). However, because diet is 
an exposure route, reverse causality cannot 
be ruled out for these cross-sectional findings 
because obese children may have greater 
exposure to BPA due to higher dietary intakes. 
Longitudinal data on effects of prenatal BPA 
exposure on postnatal adiposity are limited 
due to dissimilarities in outcome measures, 
child age, and geographic geographic location 
(Braun et al. 2014; Chou et al. 2011; Harley 
et al. 2013; Lee et al. 2014; Philippat et al. 
2014; Snijder et al. 2013; Tang et al. 2013; 
Valvi et al. 2013). Only two other U.S. studies 
that investigated BPA exposure and obesity 
vary in their anthropometric outcomes: body

Background: Early-life exposure to the endocrine disruptor bisphenol A (BPA) may contribute to 
the development of obesity. Prospective evidence in humans on this topic is limited.
oBjectives: We examined prenatal and early-childhood BPA exposures in relation to childhood 
measures of adiposity in the Columbia Center for Children’s Environmental Health (CCCEH) 
New York City birth cohort.
Methods: BPA concentrations were measured in prenatal (n = 375) and child ages 3 (n = 408) 
and 5 years (n = 518) spot urine samples. Childhood anthropometric and bioelectrical impedance 
outcomes included body mass index z-scores (BMIZ) at 5 and 7 years, and fat mass index (FMI), 
percent body fat (%BF), and waist circumference (WC) at 7 years. Associations were evaluated 
using multiple linear regression with continuous and tertile BPA concentrations.
results: Prenatal urinary BPA concentrations were positively associated with child age 7 FMI 
(β = 0.31 kg/m2; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.60, p = 0.04), %BF (β = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.03, 1.55, p = 0.04), and 
WC (β = 1.29 cm; 95% CI: 0.29, 2.30, p = 0.01), but not BMIZ, or change in BMIZ between ages 
5 and 7 years (all p-values > 0.1). FMI results were sex-specific. Child urinary BPA concentrations 
were not associated with child anthropometric outcomes (all p-values > 0.05).
conclusions: Analyses of the CCCEH longitudinal birth cohort found associations between 
prenatal urinary BPA concentrations and FMI, %BF, and WC. Our results suggest that prenatal 
BPA exposure may contribute to developmental origins of adiposity. These findings are consistent 
with several prior studies, raising concern about the pervasiveness of BPA.

mass index (BMI) trajectories and waist 
circumference (Braun et al. 2014) and BMI, 
waist circumference, fat mass, and body fat 
percent (Harley et al. 2013). We hypothe-
sized that prenatal and early childhood BPA 
exposure would be positively associated with 
childhood adiposity at ages 5 and 7 years in a 
NYC inner-city birth cohort.
Methods
Study Design and Population
Study subjects are participants in the prospec-
tive birth cohort of the Columbia Center for 
Children’s Environmental Health (CCCEH) 
in Northern Manhattan and the South Bronx, 
New York. Mother–child pairs were selected if a 
maternal prenatal urine sample was analyzed for 
BPA (n = 375) (see Figure S1). We additionally 
included children if BPA concentration in urine 
was measured at child age 3 (n = 408) and/or 
5 years (n = 518) (see Figure S2). The CCCEH 
study design is described elsewhere (Perera et al. 
2003; Whyatt et al. 2003). Briefly, we enrolled 
727 women ages 18–35 years old during their 
third trimester of pregnancy. Women were 
included if they self-identified as either African 
American or Dominican and had resided in 
Northern Manhattan or the South Bronx for at 
least 1 year before pregnancy. Exclusion criteria 
included mother’s report of cigarette smoking 
or use of other tobacco products during preg-
nancy, illicit drug use, diabetes, hypertension, 
known HIV, or a first prenatal visit after the 
20th week of gestation. Research staff abstracted 
medical records of the mother and infant at 
delivery to ascertain prenatal medical history 
and birth outcomes. We contacted partici-
pants every 3 months until child age 5 years 
and every 6 months thereafter for questionnaire 
follow-up, with children’s biological samples 
collected biennially beginning at age 3 years. 
The CCCEH study has retained documentation 
regarding loss to follow-up status and reasons for 
missed intervals.
Data collection was completed through 
age 7 years in August 2013 and laboratory 
measurement of urinary BPA was completed 
for all samples. Study procedures, question-
naires, and collection of biological samples 
were explained to each subject at enrollment, 
and a signed consent, approved by the IRB of 
Columbia University Medical Center and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
(CDC), was obtained.
Urinary Biomarker Collection
For mothers, urine was collected between 
1999 and 2006 during the third trimester 
of pregnancy (mean ± SD gestational age, 
34 ± 3 weeks) concurrent with administra-
tion of the baseline questionnaire by trained 
bilingual interviewers. In children, urine 
was collected concurrent with follow-up 
questionnaires between 2001 and 2010. All 
samples were spot urine samples collected at 
varying times of day. The date, but not the 
exact time of collection, was available.
The total (free plus conjugated) BPA 
urinary concentrations (ng/mL) were measured 
as previously described (Calafat et al. 2008). 
The limit of detection (LOD) was 0.4 ng/mL. 
Specific gravity, as a measure of urinary 
dilution, was quantified at room temperature 
at Columbia University with a handheld 
refractometer (PAL 10-S; Atago).
We also measured four urinary metabo-
lites of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) 
at CDC: mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, 
mono(2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl) phthalate, 
mono(2-ethyl-5-hydroxyhexyl) phthalate, and 
mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (Kato 
et al. 2005; Silva et al. 2007). DEHP metabo-
lite LODs ranged from 0.2 to 1.2 ng/mL. 
Urinary concentrations of DEHP metabolites 
and BPA were positively correlated (r coefficient 
range, 0.16–0.34) in the CCCEH birth cohort 
(Hoepner et al. 2013), and in the Health 
Outcomes and Measures of the Environment 
(HOME) study (Braun et al. 2011). BPA was 
undetectable prenatally (6%) and at child ages 
3 years (2%) and 5 years (2%). For the few BPA 
and DEHP metabolites results < LOD, the 
value of LOD/2 was substituted, consistent with 
prior analyses (Whyatt et al. 2003, 2009).
Anthropometric Measurements
Weight before pregnancy was self-reported by 
the mother during the third trimester. Birth 
weight was collected from the hospital medical 
record. We collected body size measurements 
and/or body composition data for children 
age 5 years (n = 498) and 7 years (n = 511). A 
Detecto Cardinal 750 digital scale/stadiometer 
(Cardinal Scale Manufacturing Company) was 
used to collect standing height measurements 
at ages 5 and 7 years until January 2010. After 
January 2010, we assessed standing height 
with the Holtain-Harpenden Wall Mounted 
Stadiometer Counter 602VR (Holtain 
Limited). Body composition values, including 
fat mass, were collected with the Tanita Digital 
Body Mass Indicator Scale BC-148 (Tanita 
Corporation of America) at age 7 years. 
Children wore light clothing and no shoes. 
Body mass index z-scores (BMIZ) were quan-
tified using the SAS programs provided by 
the CDC (2011). Fat mass index (FMI) was 
calculated using the algorithm [fat mass(kg)/
height(m)2] (VanItallie et al. 1990). Waist 
circumference (WC) was measured at a level 
midway between the lower rib margin and iliac 
crest using a nonstretchable measurement tape.
Statistical Analysis
BPA concentrations and the molar sum of 
DEHP metabolite concentrations (∑DEHP) 
were natural log (ln)–transformed for analysis 
to correct for their non-normal distribu-
tion. Specific gravity values were standard-
ized by z-score transformation to stabilize 
model constant estimates. The standardized 
specific gravity concentrations were included 
in regression models as a covariate except for 
models with BPA concentration tertiles as the 
predictor variables. Because using percentiles 
is a method of ordering by rank, we arith-
metically adjusted BPA concentrations at each 
urine collection interval to calculate tertiles by 
first accounting for urinary dilution and then 
ln-transforming using the following formula: 
Specific gravity adjusted/log-transformed 
BPA = LN{BPAraw × [(mean specific gravity 
for population at collection interval – 1)/
(individual specific gravity – 1)]} (Hauser 
et al. 2004). In other words, the prenatal 
BPA concentration was first specific gravity 
adjusted and then natural-log transformed.
For childhood BPA exposure, we calcu-
lated the mean of BPA concentrations at 
ages 3 and 5 years. In the absence of two 
childhood urinary concentrations, the single 
existing concentration was used (n = 51).
Linear regression analyses were conducted 
to determine whether maternal prenatal urinary 
BPA concentrations predicted birth weight, 
BMIZ at ages 5 and 7 years, and the change 
in BMIZ (ΔBMIZ) from age 5 to 7 years, as 
well as FMI, percent body fat (%BF), and WC 
at age 7 years. Additionally, linear regression 
was used to analyze whether child urinary BPA 
concentrations from age 3 years or the mean 
of ages 3 and 5 years predict BMIZ at ages 5 
and 7 years, ΔBMIZ from age 5 to 7 years, and 
FMI, %BF, and WC at age 7 years. To assess 
the representativeness of the subset analyzed, 
t-tests and chi-square tests were performed to 
compare subjects with and without prenatal 
and postnatal BPA concentrations and with 
and without anthropometric outcomes at 
5 years and 7 years of age.
Maternal prenatal urinary BPA concen-
trations were evaluated separately from child 
based on prior analyses in the CCCEH 
birth cohort confirming that prenatal BPA 
concentrations were not correlated with 
and were significantly lower than childhood 
BPA concentrations (Hoepner et al. 2013). 
However, we separately assessed as potential 
confounders the prenatal BPA concentrations 
in childhood predictor regression models 
and the childhood BPA concentrations in 
the prenatal predictor regression models and 
found no confounding. Furthermore, we did 
not find an association between prenatal BPA 
concentrations with maternal weight gain 
during pregnancy, so we did not consider it to 
be a confounder variable in our analysis.
Variables were tested for in the regression 
models if we had previously found they were 
associated with BPA and if they were expected 
to be associated with dietary patterns and

obesity (Hoepner et al. 2013; Rundle et al. 
2012). Variables were included in the model 
if they were significantly (p < 0.05) associated 
with the outcome. The following variables 
were controlled for in the analyses of child 
anthropometric measures at ages 5 and 7 years: 
specific gravity, ln ∑DEHP, race/ethnicity, 
dichotomous maternal prepregnancy obesity, 
child sex, birth weight, and gestational age. 
Models including prenatal BPA concentra-
tions also included prenatal specific gravity and 
ln ∑DEHP, whereas models including child-
hood BPA concentrations included childhood 
specific gravity and ln ∑DEHP. Additionally, 
we controlled for height in the analyses of 
outcomes: %BF at age 7 years and WC at 
age 7 years.
We stratified analyses by child sex in 
order to explore differences in associations 
by sex that had been found in other studies 
(Harley et al. 2013). Possible interactions 
between BPA concentration and child sex 
were assessed for all BMIZ and 7-year body 
composition outcomes.
We conducted sensitivity analyses using 
baseline data and logistic regression models to 
estimate inverse probability weighting (IPW) 
for successful follow-up to assess potential 
bias of effect estimates due to loss to follow-
up and missing anthropometric data (Curtis 
et al. 2007; Hernán et al. 2004; Robins 
et al. 2000; Rundle et al. 2012; Widen et al. 
2015). To estimate the weights, we included 
all variables in each of our final models, 
mother’s satisfaction with living conditions, 
mother’s years of school completed at time 
of pregnancy, as well as geographic informa-
tion system variables using 2000 U.S. Census 
block–group data aggregated to 1-km radial 
neighborhood buffers around the home: 
linguistic isolation and neighborhood socio-
economic status (Rundle et al. 2012).
For all analyses, we considered results 
with p < 0.05 to be statistically significant. 
Analyses were performed using IBM SPSS 
Statistics version 22.0 (IBM Corp.) and Stata 
version 13.0 (StataCorp).
Results
Demographic and clinical characteristics of the 
369 participants with prenatal BPA concentra-
tions and available birth outcomes data are 
presented in Table 1. Table 2 shows the char-
acteristics of the study participants grouped by 
BPA concentration interval and age at which 
anthropometric measures were collected. There 
was no significant difference between subjects 
with and without prenatal and postnatal BPA 
concentrations. Additionally, there was no 
significant difference between subjects with 
and without anthropometric outcomes at 
5 years and 7 years of age.
Prenatal BPA Concentration 
versus Child Anthropometry
Prenatal BPA concentrations were not asso-
ciated with birth weight (see Table S1). 
Results from analyses of fully adjusted 
ln-transformed prenatal BPA concentra-
tions and child anthropometric outcomes 
are shown in Table 3. Overall, prenatal BPA 
concentrations were not significantly associ-
ated with BMIZ at ages 5 years or 7 years

or ΔBMIZ from 5 to 7 years. Prenatal BPA 
concentrations were positively associated 
with FMI at age 7 years (β = 0.31 kg/m2; 
95% CI: 0.01, 0.60, p = 0.04,). Prenatal 
BPA concentrations were also positively asso-
ciated with %BF at age 7 years (β = 0.79, 
p = 0.04) and with WC at age 7 years 
(β = 1.29 cm, p = 0.01).
To determine whether the FMI results 
were attributable to the fat mass or the height 
component of the index, we substituted the 
fat mass itself as the dependent variable in 
the model. Prenatal BPA concentrations were 
positively associated with fat mass regard-
less of the addition of height as a covariate 
(adjusting for height: β = 0.55 kg, p = 0.02; 
without adjustment for height: β = 0.57 kg, 
p = 0.03). Prenatal BPA concentrations and 
height were not associated. Exclusion of the 
prenatal ln ∑DEHP covariate from the model 
not appreciably change the associations.
Prenatal Tertile Analysis
Linear regression analysis using tertiles of 
prenatal BPA concentrations as predictor vari-
ables, with the first tertile as the reference, 
suggested positive linear associations with 
FMI, %BF, and WC (Table 3).
Prenatal Differences by Child Sex
After stratifying by sex, among girls there 
was a positive association between prenatal 
BPA concentrations and 7-year FMI and WC 
(Table 4). Among boys, there was no associa-
tion between prenatal BPA concentrations and 
anthropometric outcomes. The interaction 
between sex and BPA concentrations was 
significant (Table 4).
Postnatal BPA Concentration 
versus Child Anthropometry
Child BPA concentrations had a borderline 
negative association with ΔBMIZ from 5 to 
7 years (β = –0.10; 95% CI: –0.02, 0.005, 
p = 0.06). Child BPA concentrations were 
not associated with FMI, %BF, or WC at age 
7 years (see Table S2).
Postnatal Tertile Analysis
Linear regression analysis using tertiles of 
child BPA concentrations as predictor vari-
ables, with the first tertile as the reference, 
was consistent with the borderline negative 
association with ΔBMIZ from 5 to 7 years 
(see Table S2). Higher exposure to BPA may 
be associated with lower ΔBMIZ.
Postnatal Differences by Child Sex
When we conducted analyses stratified by sex 
we found a negative association between child 
urinary BPA concentrations and ΔBMIZ 
from 5 to 7 years for girls and no associations 
for boys (see Table S3). Interaction terms for 
postnatal BPA concentrations and sex were 
not significant.
IPW Analysis
Weighting the data by the inverse probability 
of follow-up and complete anthropometric 
and biomarker data collection by 7 years did 
not appreciably change the size of the effect 
estimates (data not shown). 
Discussion
We observed a positive association between 
prenatal urinary BPA concentration and 
childhood FMI, %BF, and WC at age 
7 years. These results suggest prenatal BPA 
exposure is associated with overall body fat 
and central adiposity, accounting for height. 
However, contrary to our hypotheses, we 
found that maternal urinary BPA concentra-
tions were not associated with birth weight, 
childhood BMIZ at ages 5 and 7 years, and 
ΔBMIZ from age 5 to 7 years. The differences 
in results across anthropometric outcomes 
may reflect differences in the construct 
validity of body composition versus BMI as 
measures of child adiposity. BMIZ alone may 
not be the best measure of adiposity in prepu-
bertal children (Mueller et al. 2013). The few 
pediatric studies in the United States that 
evaluated BMI versus FMI concluded that 
these measures are not equivalent for deter-
mining excess adiposity in children (Weber 
et al. 2013). This is particularly important 
when considering sex because the body 
composition components of fat mass and lean 
body mass differ between sexes (Weber et al. 
2013). Literature on birth cohort studies of 
childhood obesity outcomes related to BPA 
exposure is limited, and only one study 
included longitudinal analyses of prenatal 
BPA exposure effects on school-age boys and 
girls (Braun et al. 2014; Harley et al. 2013; 
Philippat et al. 2014; Valvi et al. 2013).
In our analysis, we found sex-specific 
associations with prenatal BPA exposures 
and FMI at age 7 years. In the Cincinnati,

Ohio–based HOME study, a prospective 
cohort composed primarily of white (67%) 
and African-American (27%) children 
(n = 297), prenatal urinary BPA concen-
trations were not associated with BMI at 
ages 2–5 years (Braun et al. 2014). In the 
aforementioned study, an increase in child-
hood BMIZ slope per prenatal BPA tertile 
was observed, but sex-specific associations 
were weak and based on a small sample size 
(Braun et al. 2014). However, accelerated 
growth may be attributable to a variety of 
factors including fat mass and fat-free mass 
that can be determined only with body 
composition techniques.
Conversely, the “INfancia y Medio 
Ambiente” (INMA) population-based birth 
cohort in Spain reported positive associations 
between prenatal urinary BPA concentration 
and body size outcomes BMI and WC at age 
4 years and no sex differences (Valvi et al. 
2013). Others did not identify an association 
of prenatal urinary BPA with weight or WC 
at age 3 years in a French birth cohort subset 
of boys only (Philippat et al. 2014). In the 
Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers 
and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS) 
birth cohort consisting primarily (98%) of 
Mexican-American mothers and children in 
California, researchers found prenatal urinary 
BPA concentrations to be inversely related 
to 9 year BMIZ and %BF for girls only; 
concurrent urinary BPA concentrations were 
positively related to BMI, fat mass, and WC 
for both sexes at age 9 years (Harley et al. 
2013). Similar to our results, early child-
hood (5 years) urinary BPA concentrations 
in the CHAMACOS cohort were not related 
to late childhood (9 years) anthropometric 
outcomes. In addition, in vitro and in vivo 
experimental studies have shown positive 
associations between BPA exposure and 
adipogenesis (García-Arevalo et al. 2014; 
Masuno et al. 2002; Riu et al. 2011; Rubin 
et al. 2001; Somm et al. 2009). Our results 
are an important addition to the growing 
literature on the potential role of BPA in the 
developmental origin of overweight, obese, 
and adipose deposition.
The longitudinal cohort design of 
this study is a major strength because prior 
cross-sectional studies (Bhandari et al. 2013; 
Li et al. 2013; Trasande et al. 2012; Wang 
et al. 2012) may be biased due to associations 
between body size and higher food intake, 
leading to higher exposures to BPA from 
food. Strengths of our study include collecting 
repeated urinary BPA concentrations and 
direct assessment of childhood anthropometric 
outcomes, with the addition of bioelectrical 
impedance body composition measures at age 
7 years. The analyses found consistent results 
across the outcomes of FMI, %BF, and WC, 
although these are inter-correlated.
Another strength of our study is our 
ability to control for socioeconomic and 
additional environmental factors, including 
urinary phthalate concentrations measured 
concurrently with BPA. Additionally, our 
study design provides the opportunity for 
analysis of adiposity in understudied inner-
city minority populations. Although obesity 
prevalence among Hispanic children increased 
by 24.2% from 2003 to 2007 (Singh et al. 
2010), there is little prior information on 
prenatal and early childhood exposure 
to BPA and effects on body size outcomes 
among U.S. minority populations. Although 
obesity prevalence among African-American 
children increased 1.75% from 2003 to 2007, 
according to National Health and Nutrition 
Examination Survey (NHANES) data 
from 1999 to 2012, Hispanic and African-
American children had an obesity prevalence 
of 20.9% and 20.3%, respectively (Skinner 
and Skelton 2014). Furthermore, although 
the NHANES reports on BPA concentrations 
among different ethnic groups, it is limited to 
adults and children ≥ 6 years of age (Calafat 
et al. 2008). To date, no other study has eval-
uated the potential BPA effects on childhood 
body size in a birth cohort composed entirely 
of more than one minority group. According 
to the 2010 U.S. Census, African Americans 
and Hispanics are the dominant minority 
populations in NYC (25.5% and 28.6%, 
respectively) (U.S. Census Bureau 2012). In 
our NYC-based birth cohort, composed of 
African-American and Dominican mother–
child dyads currently being followed through 
adolescence, we found associations between 
prenatal BPA exposures and age 7 years 
anthropometric outcomes measures.
The use of spot urine samples is a poten-
tial limitation of our study. Prior studies of 
minority populations in the United States 
found a low intraclass correlation (ICC) 
for BPA between serial urine samples from 
pregnant women in Puerto Rico (ICC = 0.27) 
(Meeker et al. 2013) and African-American 
and Hispanic children in NYC (ICC = 0.22) 
(Teitelbaum et al. 2008). If, as expected, 
the exposure misclassification because of 
variability of urinary BPA concentrations 
is nondifferential in regard to the outcome, 
bias toward the null is expected. Thus, due 
to the poor reliability of the biomarkers, the 
findings for FMI, %BF, and WC are likely to 
be under 
estimates of the true effects.
Although our study was limited by the 
lack of dietary data during pregnancy and 
childhood, accurate dietary data are extremely 
difficult to acquire from young children given 
age-related development of language skills 
and recall ability. Dietary measures would 
also require quantification of BPA in food 
items, which was outside the scope of this 
study. Another possible limitation is that body 
composition at age 7 years was assessed with 
bioelectrical impedance analysis, which has 
been validated in some populations, but has 
not been compared to gold-standard refer-
ence methods in a population similar to ours 
(Haroun et al. 2009). Also, sex differences in 
pubertal development may be associated with 
body composition (Ahmed et al. 1999; Blum 
et al. 1997; Kaplowitz 2008). Earlier puberty 
in girls may lead to an  
estrogen- 
mediated 
increase in body fat (Kaplowitz 2008). 
Hormonal and precocious puberty data 
were not available for this cohort. Therefore, 
pubertal timing cannot be ruled out as a 
possible driver of the sex-specific association 
observed between prenatal BPA concentra-
tions and 7 year FMI and WC. Finally, 
although we had missing anthropometric 
and biomarker data from the children in our 
cohort, IPW analysis suggested that loss to 
follow-up did not bias our results.
Conclusions
In our longitudinal birth cohort, we found 
positive associations between prenatal urinary 
BPA concentrations and adiposity measures 
at age 7 years: FMI, %BF, and WC. The 
association with FMI was sex-specific for 
girls. Thus, future studies of environmental 
effects on childhood adiposity may be guided 
to include puberty assessment. Our findings 
suggest that prenatal BPA exposure may have 
an effect on adiposity as children age, an 
effect that cannot be observed by BMI-based 
measures alone. Our study was the first to 
examine and show associations between 
prenatal exposure to BPA and adiposity 
outcomes in school-aged children. As the 
CCCEH cohort ages into adolescence and 
emerging adulthood, follow-up studies will 
be critical for evaluating whether the asso-
ciation between prenatal BPA and adiposity 
persists over time.
