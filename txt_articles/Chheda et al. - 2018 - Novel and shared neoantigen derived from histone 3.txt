IntroductIon
Malignant gliomas, including glioblastoma and diffuse mid-
line glioma (DMG), are lethal brain tumors in both adults 
and children (Louis et al., 2016). Indeed, brain tumors are 
the leading cause of cancer-related mortality and morbidity 
in children (Brain Tumor Progress Review Group, 2000). 
Children with DIPG have 1-year progression-free survival 
rates of less than 25% and median overall survival of 9–10 
months with current treatments (Kebudi and Cakir, 2013; 
Schroeder et al., 2014).
The concept of cancer immunotherapy is based on the 
notion that the human immune system can recognize can-
cer-derived antigens as “non-self.” In recent cancer immuno-
therapy trials, life-threatening and fatal events were caused by 
on-target (Johnson et al., 2009; Morgan et al., 2010; Parkhurst 
et al., 2011) or off-target (Cameron et al., 2013; Morgan et 
al., 2013) cross-reactivity of T cells against normal cells. These 
observations underscore the need for expanding the list of 
available tumor-specific antigens, such as mutation-derived 
antigens (i.e., neoantigens), for safe and effective immuno-
therapy. Although the list of antigens that could be used for 
glioma immunotherapy has expanded over the last decade 
(Okada et al., 2009; Reardon et al., 2013), there are not many 
truly glioma-specific antigens, except for those derived from 
epidermal growth factor receptor vIII (EGFRvIII; Thorne 
et al., 2016) and mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1; 
Schumacher et al., 2014).
Recent genetic studies have revealed that malignant 
gliomas in children and young adults often show somatic 
missense mutations in the histone H3 variant 3.3 (H3.3; 
Schwartzentruber et al., 2012). A majority of DMG and more 
than 70% of DIPG cases (Khuong-Quang et al., 2012) har-
bor the amino acid substitution from lysine (K) to methio-
nine (M) at position 27 of H3.3 (H3.3K27M mutation). 
H3.3K27M mutation in DMG results in a global reduction 
of H3K27me3, leading to suppression of targets of polycomb 
repressive complex 2 (PRC2), thereby causing aberrant gene 
the median overall survival for children with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (dIPG) is less than one year. the majority of 
diffuse midline gliomas, including more than 70% of dIPGs, harbor an amino acid substitution from lysine (K) to methionine 
(M) at position 27 of histone 3 variant 3 (H3.3). From a cd8+ t cell clone established by stimulation of HLA-A2+ cd8+ t cells 
with synthetic peptide encompassing the H3.3K27M mutation, complementary dnA for t cell receptor (tcr) α- and β-chains 
were cloned into a retroviral vector. tcr-transduced HLA-A2+ t cells efficiently killed HLA-A2+H3.3K27M+ glioma cells in an 
antigen- and HLA-specific manner. Adoptive transfer of tcr-transduced t cells significantly suppressed the progression of 
glioma xenografts in mice. Alanine-scanning assays suggested the absence of known human proteins sharing the key amino 
acid residues required for recognition by the tcr, suggesting that the tcr could be safely used in patients. these data provide 
us with a strong basis for developing t cell–based therapy targeting this shared neoepitope.

expression (Jones and Baker, 2014). Patients with H3.3K27M+ 
DIPG generally have shorter survival times than those with 
nonmutated H3.3 (H3.3WT; Khuong-Quang et al., 2012).
We discuss herein the identification of an HLA-
A*02:01-restricted CD8+ CTL epitope encompassing the 
H3.3K27M mutation. Furthermore, we have cloned cDNA 
for 
TCR α- and β-chains derived from an H3.3K27M-specific 
CD8+ T cell clone. The TCR binds to the HLA-
A*02:01-peptide complex at excellent affinity levels, and 
HLA-A*02:01+ donor-derived T cells transduced with the 
TCR recognize and lyse HLA-A*02:01+ H3.3K27M+ glioma 
cells in a mutation- and HLA-specific manner. Importantly, 
alanine scan assays demonstrated that there are no known 
human proteins that share the set of key amino acid residues 
for recognition by the 
TCR. Our data strongly support devel-
opment of vaccine- and TCR-transduced T cell–based im-
munotherapy strategies in patients with H3.3K27M+ gliomas.

the H3.3K27M peptide binds to HLA-A*02:01
Using the NetMHC 3.4 server (http 
://www 
.cbs 
.dtu 
.dk 
/services 
/NetMHC 
/), an artificial neural network–based 
bioinformatic tool for predicting the binding of peptides to 
HLA class I MHC molecules, we predicted that a decamer 
(10-mer) peptide H3.3K27M26–35, encompassing residues 
26–35 of the H3.3 sequence and including the K27M 
mutation (H3.3K27M peptide), would bind HLA-A*02:01 
with high affinity. Interestingly, the nonmutant counterpart 
H3.3WT26–35 was not predicted to have high affinity for 
HLA-A*02:01 (hereafter H3.3WT peptide; Table 1). 
T
o confirm these predictions, we measured the binding 
of synthetic peptides to purified HLA-A*02:01 using a 
competitive inhibition assay. Consistent with the NetMHC 
3.4 predictions, we found that the H3.3K27M peptide, 
but not H3.3WT, bound HLA-A*02:01 with high affinity 
(Table 1). We also extended our binding analysis to HLA-
A*02:02, A*02:03, A*02:06, A*02:07, and A*02:17 and 
found that the H3.3K27M peptide weakly bound to A*02:03 
(half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] 747 nM), but 
none of the other evaluated HLA-A2 subtypes did (Table S1).
the H3.3K27M peptide induces specific t cell responses 
in HLA-A2+ patients with H3.3K27M+ glioma and leads to 
isolation of high tetramer–binding cd8+ t cell clones
To evaluate whether the H3.3K27M epitope induces an 
antigen-specific response in peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells (PBMCs) of DIPG patients, we stimulated PBMC sam-
ples derived from three HLA-A*02:01+ DIPG patients and 
three HLA-A*02:01+ healthy donors in vitro with H3.3WT, 
H3.3K27M, influenza matrix protein M158–66 peptide (here-
after flu peptide) or without peptide for 1 wk and performed 
IFN-γ ELI 
SPOT assays after co-culture with T2 cells loaded 
with H3.3WT, H3.3K27M, or flu peptide. In all three pa-
tients but none of healthy donors, PBMCs stimulated with 
the H3.3K27M peptide showed antigen-specific increases 
of IFN-γ spots when co-cultured with T2 cells loaded 
with H3.3K27M peptide (Fig. 1 A). On the other hand, 
PBMCs stimulated with H3.3WT demonstrated only back-
ground or significantly lower levels of IFN-γ compared with 
H3.3K27M-stimulated PBMCs. Although PBMCs from pa-
tient 1 demonstrated higher background levels than those of 
other donors, H3.3K27M-stimulated PBMCs showed sig-
nificantly higher levels of IFN-γ production upon co-culture 
with H3.3K27M-loaded T2 cells compared with other 
conditions. PBMCs stimulated with the flu peptide served 
as a positive control in this assay. These results suggest that 
H3.3K27M+ gliomas may elicit spontaneous CD8+ T cell 
responses in HLA-A*02:01+ patients, but the level of the re-
sponses is not sufficient to prevent tumor development.
Next, we stimulated HLA-A*02:01+ healthy donor–de-
rived PBMCs with synthetic H3.3K27M peptide in vitro for 
four weekly cycles and evaluated the induction of CD8+ T 
cells capable of binding to the HLA-A*02:01-H3.3K27M26–35 
tetramer. As demonstrated in Fig. 1 B, we found that >60% of 
CD8+ T cells bound to the tetramer. Furthermore, a subpop-
ulation of the CD8+tetramer+ T cells in the culture showed 
distinctively higher levels of binding to the tetramer (tetra-
merhigh population; 2.4% of CD8+ cells; Fig. 1 B). Among sev-
eral CD8+ 
T cell clones established by limiting dilution of the 
tetramerhigh CTL subpopulation, we selected clone 1H5 for 
subsequent studies because of its excellent tetramer reactivity 
(Fig. 1 C). Clone 1H5 also demonstrated a peptide dose–
dependent increase of IFN-γ production when stimulated 
by HLA-A*02:01+ T2 cells loaded with mutant H3.3K27M 
peptide, but not the H3.3WT peptide (Fig. 1 D).
the H3.3K27M peptide is presented as an HLA-
A*02:01+-binding epitope by glioma cells 
transfected with H3.3K27M cdnA
To investigate whether the bioinformatically predicted 
H3.3K27M26–35 peptide is produced and presented by the 
HLA machinery in HLA-A*02:01+ H3.3K27M+ glioma 
cells, we used a recently developed mass spectrometry 
(MS)-based method for the direct identification of HLA

class I–binding peptides (Bassani-Sternberg et al., 2015). 
We purified HLA class I–binding peptides from HLA-
A*02:01+H3.3K27M− U87MG glioma cells stably trans-
duced with cDNA encoding H3.3K27M (U87H3.3K27M), 
H3.3WT (U87H3.3WT), or parental U87MG cells (Table 
S3) and analyzed them by LC-MS/MS using a quadru-
pole Orbitrap mass spectrometer. To specifically identify the 
H3.3K27M26–35 peptide, we added a fixed amount of a syn-
thetic version of the H3.3K27M26–35 10-mer to each sample 
containing a substitution of arginine at position 1 with the 
heavy counterpart (13C6 15N4 arginine), thus introducing 
a 10.0083-D mass difference. With this approach, the heavy 
labeled peptide was readily sequenced and identified because 
of its higher abundance during LC-MS/MS analysis. Because 
both the heavy and light peptides elute at the same time 
from the chromatographic column and differ exclusively in 
the introduced mass change, it was possible to confidently 
identify the endogenous peptide even at extremely low con-
centrations and in the absence of an MS/MS spectrum. After 
recalibration in MaxQuant, we detected two coeluting iso-
tope patterns with mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) of 494.7420 
and 489.7394 at 27.74 min of chromatographic separation in 
U87H3.3K27M glioma cells (Fig. 2 A). This was compatible 
with the predicted values for both heavy and endogenous 
H3.3K27M26–35 peptides in their oxidized forms (494.7414 
and 489.7373, respectively) with a relative mass difference 
of 10.0052 D. The elution peak corresponding to the heavy 
peptide was selected multiple times for sequencing, and its

fragmentation spectrum was unequivocally identified as the 
oxidized form of the heavy H3.3K27M (Andromeda iden-
tification score 124.23; Fig. 2 B). The putative light isotope 
pattern presented correct m/z values for each of its isotopic 
peaks (Fig. 2 C). Moreover, this isotope pattern was detect-
able exclusively in U87H3.3K27M cells but not in either 
parental U87 or U87H3.3WT cells (not depicted). 
The mod-
ification observed in both peptides is caused by oxidation of 
the methionine residue during experimental sample prepa-
ration and therefore does not reflect the state of the peptide 
in vivo (Lagerwerf et al., 1996). Together, these observations 
demonstrate that the H3.3K27M26–35 epitope peptide is nat-
urally produced and presented by HLA class I on the surface 
of glioma cells transfected with H3.3K27M cDNA.

H3.3K27M-specific ctL reactivity
We isolated full-length cDNA for α- and β-chains of TCR 
from the clone 1H5, optimized the codon usage, and cloned 
them into a 
TCR retroviral vector system, which incorporates 
siRNA targeting constant regions of the endogenous TCR 
α- and β-chains to avoid mispairing between endogenous and 
transgene 
TCR chains (Fig. 3 A; Okamoto et al., 2009, 2012). 
T
o evaluate the function of the transgene TCR, especially in 
relation to coexpression of CD8, we transduced the Jurkat 
T cell clone 76 (J76CD8−), which is deficient of endoge-
nous CD8 as well as TCR α- and β-chains (Heemskerk et al., 
2003), and CD8-transfected Jurkat 
T cell clone 76 (J76CD8+)

with the TCR vector. The TCR-transduced J76CD8+/− cells 
were then co-cultured with T2 cells pulsed with H3.3WT, 
H3.3K27M, or irrelevant flu peptide. TCR-transduced 
J76CD8+ cells produced significantly higher levels of IL-2 in 
response to H3.3K27M peptide compared with all the other 
groups, indicating H3.3K27M-specific and CD8-dependent 
reactivity of the TCR (Fig. 3 B).
Next, we transduced primary human T cells with the 
TCR and achieved >40% transduction efficiency in CD8+ 
T cells and ∼20% in CD4+ 
T cells based on tetramer stain-
ing, suggesting that the CD8 coreceptor is important for 
efficient expression of the TCR (Fig. 3 C). To evaluate the 
functionality of the 
TCR in human primary 
T cells as well 
as the requirement of the CD8 coreceptor for functional 
response, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells were simultane-
ously transduced with the TCR and co-cultured with T2 
cells pulsed with H3.3K27M, H3.3WT, or flu peptide, and 
IFN-γ production was evaluated by ELI 
SPOT (Fig. 3 D). 
TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells produced significantly 
higher numbers of IFN-γ spots than TCR-transduced 
CD4+ T cells upon stimulation with H3.3K27M pep-
tide. Moreover, the response of TCR-transduced CD8+ 
T cells was specific to H3.3K27M peptide, as these cells 
produced significantly higher numbers of IFN-γ spots in 
response to H3.3K27M peptide compared with H3.3WT, 
flu peptide, or no peptide (Fig. 3 D). However, although 
not at statistically significant levels, we observed a trend 
that TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells produced increased 
numbers of IFN-γ spots compared with mock-transduced 
CD8+ T cells against T2 cells loaded with H3.3WT pep-
tide (P = 0.254). Although the concentration of the 
peptide was clearly supraphysiological (10 µg/ml), this 
observation should remind us of a theoretical possibility 
of off-tumor reactivity.
We also observed significant up-regulation of the 
T cell activation marker, CD69 (Werfel et al., 1997), on 
TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells, but not mock-transduced 
T cells stimulated with the H3.3K27M peptide but 
not H3.3WT or an irrelevant flu peptide (Fig. 3 E). 
Mock-transduced T cells were prepared by the same activa-
tion method as TCR-transduced T cells using anti-CD3 anti-
body and RetroNectin as detailed in Materials and methods.

Alanine scanning data suggest the absence of known 
human proteins that share the key immunogenic amino acid 
residues of the H3.3K27M epitope
To ensure the specificity and safety of the H3.3K27M-targeting 
approach, it is essential to determine the key amino acid 
residues in the H3.3K27M epitope that are responsible 
for the TCR reactivity. This allows the prediction and as-
sessment of cross-reactivity to other epitopes derived from 
proteins present in normal cells. T
o this end, we performed 
alanine-scanning mutagenesis of the H3.3K27M epitope by 
introducing single alanine mutations (10 in total) at every po-
sition within the H3.3K27M decamer epitope. Hence, we 
prepared 10 unique synthetic peptides that each contained a 
specific amino acid substitution with alanine (A1–A10) and 
evaluated whether the substitution alters the stability of pep-
tide binding to HLA-A*02:01 (Fig. 4 A). When the bind-
ing was diminished by the substitution compared with the 
H3.3K27M epitope, it suggests that the substituted residue 
was critical for HLA-A*02:01 binding of the epitope. Ac-
cordingly, substitutions at position 2 and the C terminus were 
associated with >20-fold reductions in binding capacity, con-
sistent with these positions being canonical HLA-A*02:01 
primary anchors. Reductions in the 10–20-fold range were 
also noted in positions 1, 4, 6, 7, and 9, suggesting that they 
may also act as secondary MHC contacts.
Next, we evaluated IL-2 production as the readout for 
the functionality of TCR-transduced cells when co-cultured 
with T2 cells loaded with each of the altered peptides 
(Fig. 4 B). Amino acids for which substitutions result in di-
minished IL-2 production are critical for recognition by the 
TCR. Both HLA binding affinity (Fig. 4 A) and TCR reac-
tivity as determined by IL-2 production (Fig. 4 B) consis-
tently showed that amino acids at positions 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 
and 10 are critical for TCR recognition and function. Using 
NCBI BLA 
ST 2.7.0, we queried for “RMX 
AXS 
TGGV” 
(residues 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10) against the Homo Sapiens 
Protein Data Bank Proteins database and found no known 
human proteins that contain the same amino acid residues. 
We extended our search to find proteins with amino acid 
motifs that are homologous to the key amino acid residues 
(Table S2). Not surprisingly, relatively high homology was 
found in histone H3 family proteins and PRC2, but not other 
proteins. Based on the alanine scanning data, these proteins 
are not likely to be targeted by the TCR.
the H3.3K27M-specific tcr does not recognize 
the nonmutated, deiminated H3.3K27M epitope or 
H3.1-derived K27M peptide
Consistent with our data in Figs. 1 and 3, the H3.3WT peptide 
does not bind or elicit IL-2 production by the TCR (Fig. 4). 
The natural process of deimination can convert histone argi-
nine to citrulline, including the arginine residue within the 
H3.3K27M epitope (i.e., deimination; Cuthbert et al., 2004). 
Therefore, it is useful to determine whether deimination 
can affect the immunogenicity of the H3.3K27M epitope. 
T
o this end, we evaluated whether the H3.3K27M-specific 
TCR is reactive to the deiminated H3.3K27M epitope using 
a synthetic peptide in which the arginine residue of the 
H3.3K27M epitope is replaced by citrulline (Cit H3.3; Fig. 4, 
A and B). Although the Cit H3.3 peptide partially retains its 
affinity to HLA-A*02:01 (Fig. 4 A), it completely abrogates 
IL-2 production by TCR-transduced Jurkat cells, indicating 
that the TCR does not recognize the Cit H3.3 peptide.
A subpopulation of glioma patients bear the K27M mu-
tation in H3.1 (a homologue of H3.3; Jones and Baker, 2014). 
H3.1K27M mutations are found in >20% of DIPG and 5% 
of DMG cases and are strongly associated with younger age 
(Jones and Baker, 2014). The amino acid sequences encom-
passing the K27M mutation in H3.1 and H3.3 are similar. 
Figure 4. Alanine scanning mutagenesis determines key amino acid 
residues in the H3.3K27M epitope required for tcr recognition. Sin-
gle alanine mutations (10 in total) were introduced at every amino acid 
residue within the H3.3K27M epitope (10-mer). Hence, 10 synthetic pep-
tides each containing the specific substitution with alanine (A1–A3 and 
A5–A10) or valine (A4) were evaluated. In addition, synthetic peptides de-
signed for nonmutated H3.3WT peptide and citrullinated H3.3K27M (Cit 
H3.3; i.e., the first amino acid of the H3.3K27M epitope was replaced by 
citrulline) were evaluated. (A) Relative HLA-A*0201 binding affinity of each 
peptide to that of H3.3K27M was determined by cell-free binding assay. 
This experiment was performed once. (B) J.RT3-T3.5 cells were transduced 
with H3.3K27M-specific TCR and evaluated for IL-2 production in response 
to T2 cells loaded with each peptide (10 µg/ml). Each group was assayed 
in triplicate. Bars and error bars represent median and SD, respectively, for 
IL-2 production levels. Data represent two independent experiments with 
similar results. *, P < 0.05 was calculated using Student’s t test comparing 
each peptide with the mutant H3.3.

Compared with the H3.3K27M epitope, the corresponding 
portion of H3.1 has only one amino acid substitution at the 
sixth position in the 10-mer peptide and is therefore identi-
cal to the peptide A6 in the alanine scanning. Both binding 
(Fig. 4 A) and IL-2 production (Fig. 4 B) were abrogated in 
the case of A6, suggesting that patients with the H3.1K27M 
mutation but without the H3.3K27M mutation are not eligi-
ble for prospective TCR-transduced adoptive transfer therapy.
characterization of affinity and 
functional avidity of the tcr
T
o determine the affinity of the TCR with H3.3K27M 
-HLA-A2 complex, we performed surface plasmon res-
onance (SPR) assays using recombinant TCR and the 
H3.3K27M-HLA-A2 complex, which was produced by in 
vitro folding from bacterial inclusion bodies. As shown in 
Fig. 5 (A and B), we obtained a dissociation constant (KD) of 
2.9 µM. Notably, this level of affinity is substantially higher 
than that of most TCRs directed against cancer antigens and 
is comparable to that of well-characterized TCRs against in-
fectious pathogen-derived peptides (Aleksic et al., 2012).
T
o evaluate the functional avidity of the TCR, we 
determined the peptide concentration required to in-
duce a half-maximal response (EC50) per IFN-γ produc-
tion by TCR-transduced CD8+ and CD4+ T cells obtained 
from three healthy HLA-A*02:01+ donors. We determined 
the EC50 of TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells to be between 
10−8 and 10−9 M based on IFN-γ ELI 
SPOT assay with T2 
cells loaded with titrating doses of the H3.3K27M peptide 
(Fig. 5 C). Notably, TCR-transduced CD4+ T cells showed 
much lower numbers of IFN-γ spots, suggesting a requirement 
of CD8 coreceptor for the functional response. The response 
of TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells was specific to H3.3K27M 
peptide presented on HLA-A2, as demonstrated by the lack 
of response with T2 cells loaded with flu peptide (10 µg/ml) 
and HLA-A2–negative HSJD-DIPG-019 cells loaded with 
H3.3K27M peptide (10 µg/ml; Fig. 5 D). However, as we 
also noted in the dataset in Fig. 3 D, TCR-transduced CD8+ 
T cells produced modest numbers of IFN-γ spots against T2 
cells loaded with 10 µg/ml H3.3WT peptide (P = 0.1000 
compared with the group of T2 cells with no peptide).
tcr-transduced t cells specifically lyse 
H3.3K27M+HLA-A2+ glioma cells in vitro
It is essential to demonstrate that TCR-transduced T cells 
are able to recognize the H3.3K27M epitope that is endog-
enously expressed in glioma cells and lyse H3.3K27M+H-
LA-A*02:01+ glioma cells.

tection-based cytotoxicity assay (Table S3). Although both 
TCR-transduced and mock-transduced T cells were sim-
ilarly activated, only TCR-transduced T cells lysed HLA-
A*02:01+ HSJD-DIPG-017 and HSJD-DIPG-021 cells 
(Fig. 6, A and B). The observed lysis was dependent on HLA-
A*02:01, as TCR-transduced T cells were not able to lyse 
HSJD-DIPG-019 cells, even in the presence of exogenously

added H3.3K27M peptide (Fig. 6 C). After stable transduc-
tion with HLA-A*02:01, HSJD-DIPG019 cells became sus-
ceptible to the cytotoxic effect of the TCR-transduced T 
cells (Fig. 6 D), indicating HLA-A*02:01-dependent lysis of 
DIPG cells that express physiological levels of H3.3K27M. 
T
o 
demonstrate that the reactivity of TCR-transduced T cells is 
specific to H3.3K27M, we used HLA-A*02:01+H3.3K27Mneg 
U87MG glioma cells that were stably transduced with 
cDNA encoding H3.3K27M (U87H3.3K27M) or H3.3WT 
(U87H3.3WT; Fig. 6, E and F). TCR-transduced T cells ef-
ficiently lysed U87H3.3K27M cells but not U87H3.3WT 
cells. Lysis of U87H3.3K27M cells was enhanced when 
synthetic H3.3K27M peptide was added but abrogated by 
the anti–HLA-A2 blocking antibody. On the other hand, 
TCR-transduced T cells lysed U87H3.3WT cells only 
when loaded with synthetic H3.3K27M peptide (Fig. 6 E). 
As an additional method to confirm the H3.3K27M and 
HLA-A*02:01 specific cytotoxicity of TCR-transduced T 
cells, we used carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CF-
SE)-stained target cells (U87H3.3K27M and U87H3.3WT) 
in the co-culture assay and evaluated the expression of 
7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) on the CFSE+ target cells as 
an early marker for cell death (Lecoeur et al., 2001; Fig. 6 F). 
Our results confirmed those obtained by LDH-based assay. 
These results indicate that TCR-transduced T cells are able 
to recognize the H3.3K27M epitope that is processed and 
presented by H3.3K27M+HLA-A*02:01+ glioma cells and 
specifically lyse those glioma cells.

nocompromised NSG mice on day 0. On days 14 and 30, 
mice with established tumors received intravenous injec-
tions of either PBS, 5 × 106 control mock-transduced T 
cells, or 5 × 106 TCR-transduced T cells. Bioluminescence 
imaging (BLI) indicated a significant reduction in the tumor 
burden in mice receiving TCR-transduced T cells but not 
in mice receiving PBS or mock-transduced T cells (Fig. 7, 
A and B). After day 31, regardless of the tumor size, mice 
receiving either mock-transduced or TCR-transduced T 
cells started to present signs suggestive of graft-versus-host 
disease, such as ruffled fur, hunched posture, slow mobility, 
and weight loss (not depicted), and thus we were unable 
to evaluate the impact of therapy on long-term survival. 
Nonetheless, in an attempt to determine the accumulation 
of TCR-transduced T cells in the intracranial xenograft, 
we killed the mice on day 32 (2 d after T cell infusion) and 
evaluated tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes using the HLA-
A*02:01-H3.3K27M26–35 dextramer as well as anti-CD8 
and anti-CD4 monoclonal antibodies. Although the trans-
duction efficiency of the infused CD8+ and CD4+ cells 
was ∼50% and 30%, respectively (Fig. 7 C), we found that 
>80% and 40% of human CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, respec-
tively, were positive for the dextramer in the tumor. On 
the other hand, ∼10% and 20% of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells 
were dextramer positive in the peripheral blood (Fig. 7 C). 
These data suggest that there was a selective accumulation 
of TCR-transduced T cells in the intracranial tumor site 2 
d after T cell infusion. Our evaluation on the presence and 
function of infused T cells at longer time points was chal-
lenged by the regression of the tumor and associated dis-
appearance of T cells from the brain (Fig. S1). Nonetheless, 
we observed TCR-transduced CD4+ and CD8+ cells in 
the spleen, lung, and peripheral blood 10 d after infusion. 
Further studies are warranted using syngeneic models to 
evaluate the precise interactions between TCR-transduced 
T cells and the host environment.
dIscussIon
In the current study, we identified a novel HLA-A*02:01- 
restricted neoantigen epitope encompassing the H3.3K27M 
mutation, which is present in the majority of DMG in children 
and young adults (Solomon et al., 2016; Chiang and Ellison, 
2017). Furthermore, we cloned a high-affinity TCR that spe-
cifically recognizes the H3.3K27M epitope endogenously ex-
pressed by H3.3K27M+HLA-A*0201+ glioma cells.
Heteroclitic peptide modifications to tumor antigen 
T cell epitopes have been described in the literature. Espe-
cially, replacement of the amino acid residue at position 2 
to methionine has increased binding to HLA-A*02:01 and 
CTL-inducing ability of gp100209–217 epitope (Dionne et 
al., 2003; Rosenberg et al., 2005). It is interesting that the 
H3.3K27M hotspot mutation has a fortuitous substitution of 
methionine at position 27 (position 2 of the epitope peptide)

intravenous infusion, the percentage of dextramer+ cells among CD8+ T 
cells and CD4+ T cells was evaluated in the peripheral blood and brain

that naturally generates a heteroclitic peptide with improved 
HLA-A2 binding and immunogenicity compared with the 
nonmutated H3.3WT peptide.
Although most missense mutation–derived neoantigens 
are unique to individual patients (Tran et al., 2015, 2016), 
we expect that immunotherapy targeting the H3.3K27M 
epitope could be applicable to hundreds of patients annually 
in the United States and elsewhere, based on the high 
frequency of the H3.3K27M mutation and prevalence of 
HLA-A*02:01 (http 
://www 
.cbtrus 
.org; Zhang et al., 2017). 
We were able to detect H3.3K27M-specific T cell responses 
in DIPG patient–derived PBMCs but not healthy donor–
derived PBMCs. Although these observations may imply that 
spontaneous H3.3K27M-specific T cell responses are not 
sufficient to control the tumor growth, these observations 
also substantiate our MS analysis demonstrating the presence 
of the H3.3K27M epitope in the HLA class I of H3.3K27M+ 
glioma cells. During the submission and revision processes 
of the current article, Ochs et al. (2017) reported that a 
peptide encompassing the H3.3K27M induces specific 
CTL and Th1 responses in HLA-A2.DR1 transgenic mice. 
Although their study did not identify antigen-specific CTL 
clones or TCR cDNA, it confirms our results regarding the 
immunogenicity of the H3.3K27M epitope in HLA-A2+ 
hosts. Together, these findings provide a rationale for 
enhancing the response by the peptide vaccine. In fact, we 
recently implemented a multicenter pilot study to evaluate 
the safety, immunoreactivity, and preliminary efficacy of a 
vaccine using the synthetic H3.3K27M26–35 epitope peptide 
in children with H3.3K27M+ DIPG or high-grade glioma 
through the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium 
(PNOC-007; NCT02960230).
Although the list of antigens that could be used for 
glioma immunotherapy has expanded over the last decade 
(Okada et al., 2009; Reardon et al., 2013), including those 
identified (Okano et al., 2002; Eguchi et al., 2006) or char-
acterized (Hatano et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2007) by our 
group, there have not been many truly glioma-specific an-
tigens, except for those derived from EGFRvIII (Ohno et 
al., 2013; Johnson et al., 2015) and IDH1 (Schumacher et al., 
2014). Furthermore, because of the marked heterogeneity of 
genetics and protein expression in solid cancers, targeting a 
single antigen may result in the evolution of tumor variants 
that lack the target antigen (Genßler et al., 2015; Navai and 
Ahmed, 2016). These observations underscore the need for 
expanding the list of available tumor-specific antigens, such 
as mutation-derived antigens (i.e., neoantigens), for safe and 
effective immunotherapy. The H3.3K27M-derived neoanti-
gen epitope will be a valuable target because not only is it 
tumor specific, but the K27M mutant protein is also present 
throughout all tumor nuclei in each of the 47 cases evaluated 
by immunohistochemistry (Solomon et al., 2016), suggesting 
that this may be a truncal mutation and less likely to lead 
to antigen loss–mediated escape of the tumor. Given the re-
cent occurrence of life-threatening and fatal events in can-
cer immunotherapy trials caused by on-target (Johnson et al., 
2009; Morgan et al., 2010; Parkhurst et al., 2011) or off-target 
(Cameron et al., 2013; Morgan et al., 2013) cross-reactivity of 
T cells against normal cells, we focused our attention on ad-
dressing the antigen specificity of the 
TCR by performing al-
anine scanning (Cunningham and Wells, 1989; García-Peydró 
et al., 2000; Cameron et al., 2013).
Although our results revealed the absence of any known 
human proteins that share the same amino acid motif for rec-
ognition by the 
TCR, we also recognize that alanine scanning 
may not exclude all possibilities of cross-reactivity. In fact, al-
though it was not at statistically significant levels, we observed 
a trend that TCR-transduced CD8+ T cells produced modest 
numbers of IFN-γ spots against T2 cells loaded with a supra-
physiological (10 µg/ml) concentration of H3.3WT peptide, 
suggesting a theoretical possibility of off-tumor reactivity. A 
full scan using a panel of all possible amino acid substitution 
combinations across the epitope would allow the derivation 
of a full pattern, or motif, for every potentially tolerated pep-
tide and would provide the most comprehensive information.
Nonetheless, our data from the alanine scan provide us 
with a basis for understanding peptide specificity and how to 
evade potential cross-reactivity–induced toxicities. T
o further 
elucidate the specificity and cross-reactivity of the TCR, we 
have initiated a collaborative effort by integrating structural 
biology to characterize the interaction between the 
TCR and 
peptide-loaded HLA complexes (Adams et al., 2016).
The amino acid sequence of the A6 peptide in the 
alanine scan assay is identical to the peptide encompassing 
residues 26–35 of the H3.1 sequence and including the 
K27M mutation (Wu et al., 2012). The diminished pep-
tide-HLA-A*02:01 binding and TCR recognition with the 
A6 peptide strongly suggests that our TCR will not be ap-
plicable to patients with the H3.1K27M mutation. Similarly, 
based on our alanine scanning data, if the tumor bears ci-
trullinated R26 in addition to the K27M mutation in H3.3, 
the TCR will not likely respond. Hence, future clinical trials 
may need to evaluate patients’ glioma tissue for citrullination 
of R26 in H3.3 as a part of eligibility screening, if a feasi-
ble evaluation method becomes available. Furthermore, our 
peptide binding assays with HLA-A2 subtypes suggested that 
the H3.3K27M epitope peptide may not bind efficiently to 
HLA-A2 subtypes other than HLA-A*02:01. This has to be 
considered in our considerations of patient eligibility.
Our SPR data indicated that the affinity of the TCR 
to H3.3K27M-HLA-A*02:01 is comparable to that of 
well-characterized high-affinity TCRs specific for viral or 
bacterial antigens (Aleksic et al., 2012). Nonviral cancer or 
self-antigen peptides usually bind TCRs at lower affinity lev-
els (KD 50–200 µM), as high-affinity TCRs to self-antigens 
are likely to be negatively selected in thymus. Although the 
kinetics of the TCR-H3.3K27M-HLA-A2 interaction was 
too fast to be accurately determined by our SPR experiment, 
fast kinetics is a salient feature for TCR-peptide HLA class I 
interactions (Cole et al., 2007).

JEM Vol. 215, No. 1
Based on our peptide titration assay using primary 
human CD8+ T cells transduced with the TCR, the EC50 
ranges from 10−8 to 10−9 M, which is at least comparable 
with several known HLA-binding epitopes derived from 
melanoma antigens (Bakker et al., 1995; Lupetti et al., 1998). 
On the other hand, TCR-transduced CD4+ T cells failed to 
demonstrate comparable responses, strongly suggesting the 
requirement of CD8 coreceptor for sufficient functions of 
the TCR. These data also imply a benefit of selecting CD8+ 
T cells for transduction of the TCR in future clinical trials.
With regard to the TCR transduction system, a widely 
described pitfall in the use of TCR transduced T cells is mi-
spairing between endogenous and transgene-derived α and 
β TCR chains, leading to reduced transgene TCR expres-
sion, unanticipated off-target reactivity, and/or autoimmunity 
(Govers et al., 2010; Zhang and Morgan, 2012). T
o ensure 
and enhance proper pairing of transgene-derived α and 
β-chains, a variety of gene-engineering technologies have 
been evaluated, such as introduction of a disulfide bridge in 
the α/β constant regions by the addition of extra cysteine 
residues, substituting human with murine constant regions, 
codon optimization, TCR chain leucine zipper fusions, and 
a single-chain TCR (Govers et al., 2010; Zhang and Morgan, 
2012). In the current study, we were able to achieve excellent 
expression of the transgene TCR chains by incorporation of 
siRNA against the endogenous TCR (Okamoto et al., 2009, 
2012) and cDNA codon optimization.
Our data from the MS analysis of U87H3.3K27M cells 
and cytotoxic assays using HSJD-DIPG-017 cells indicate 
that the H3.3K27M epitope is naturally produced and pre-
sented by HLA-A*02:01 on the surface of H3.3K27M+ gli-
oma cells. Our MS analysis as well as in vivo xenograft studies 
used U87H3.3K27M cells but not bona fide DIPG cells, such 
as HSJD-DIPG-017. This was because both assays require 
large numbers of cells (e.g., 5 × 108 cells needed for a single 
round of MS analysis), and none of bona fide DIPG cell lines 
could be grown in sufficient quantities within a reasonable 
time frame. Nevertheless, our datasets using a variety of cell 
lines support our important conclusion that the H3.3K27M 
epitope in glioma cells is targetable by the TCR.
Although our data with a xenograft model in NSG mice 
clearly demonstrated the efficacy of intravenously infused 
TCR-transduced 
T cells in vivo, we had limited opportunities 
to investigate precise interactions between the infused T cells 
and the host environment in immunocompromised mice. We 
have addressed our major focus on molecular factors, such as a 
chemokine, CXCL10 (Zhu et al., 2010; Ohkuri et al., 2014), 
and an integrin receptor, very late activation antigen (VLA)-
4, which promote T cell infiltration in brain tumors using 
syngeneic models (Sasaki et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2007). We 
will need to integrate these findings into the development of 
effective TCR-transduced T cell therapy approaches.
Data from the current study provide a solid foundation 
to develop safe and effective 
T cell–based immunotherapy tar-
geting the H3.3K27M epitope. Recent studies have suggested 
that robust antitumor immune responses might be achieved 
by adoptive transfer of ex vivo–activated T cells (Rosenberg 
and Restifo, 2015). Therefore, we will direct our translational 
efforts to further optimize our TCR and develop effective T 
cell adoptive therapy for patients with H3.3K27M+ gliomas.

cells and cell culture
DIPG neurosphere cultures were maintained in tumor 
stem medium containing Neurobasal-A Medium (1×), 
DMEM/F-12, Hepes buffer, sodium pyruvate, MEM nones-
sential amino acids, GlutaMAX-I, anti-anti solution, and B-27 
supplement minus vitamin A or Gem21 neuroplex, all pur-
chased from Life T
echnologies. Medium was supplemented 
with 20 ng/ml recombinant human EGF (rhEGF; AF-100-
15; Peprotech), 20 ng/ml rhFGF-basic (AF-100-18B; Pepro-
tech), 10 ng/ml hPDGF-AA (100-13A; Peprotech), 10 ng/
ml hPDGF-BB (100-14B; Peprotech), and 2 µg/ml heparin 
solution (H3149-10KU; Sigma-Aldrich) at initiation of cell 
culture and weekly thereafter. Cells were passaged by tritura-
tion in TrypLE Express (12604-039; Invitrogen) and DNase1 
(LS002007; Worthington) followed by resuspension in fresh 
medium. U87H3.3K27M and U87H3.3WT were generated 
by transfection of a PT2/C vector encoding cDNA for either 
WT H3.3 or the K27M H3.3 into parental HLA-A2*01+ 
H3.3K27Mneg U87MG cells using FuGENE HD transfection 
reagent (E2311; Promega). Expression of H3.3K27M was 
confirmed by Western blot analysis with an anti-H3.3K27M 
antibody (ABE419; Millipore). HSJD-DIPG019 cells were 
transduced with lentiviral vector encoding HLA-A2*01 
cDNA with puromycin selection marker (VectorBuilder) for 
generation of HSJD-DIPG019-HLA-A2*01 cells. The Jurkat 
T cell clone 76 (J76CD8) cell line (Heemskerk et al., 2003), 
which is deficient in endogenous TCR α- and β-chains but 
express human CD8, was provided by M. Heemskerk (Leiden 
University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands). Cell lines 
used were confirmed to be negative for mycoplasma infection.
t cell isolation
LRS chambers containing healthy donor–derived HLA-
A*02:01+ PBMCs were obtained from the Stanford Blood 
Bank. Patient-derived PBMCs were obtained through the 
Institutional Review Board–approved Neurosurgery Tissue 
Bank (IRB/CHR# 10-01318; PI, J. Phillips) with coded 
tissue information without any protected health identifiers. 
T cells were enriched from whole blood by immunodensity 
isolation using the RosetteSep Human T cell Enrichment 
Cocktail (15061; Stem Cell T
echnologies) according to the 
manufacturer’s suggested protocol. T cells were cryopreserved 
in RPMI medium containing 20% human AB serum and 
10% DMSO and stored at −196°C.
Peptides

TGGV), H3.1K27M26–35 (RMS

matrix protein M158–66 flu peptide (GIL 
GFV 
FTL), as well 
as peptides used for the alanine scanning assay, were syn-
thesized by A&A Laboratories and were >95% pure as in-
dicated by analytic HPLC and MS analyses. Peptides were 
dissolved in DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/ml and 
stored at −80°C until use.
HLA-peptide binding assays
Quantitative assays to measure the binding of peptides to pu-
rified HLA A*02:01 class I molecules are based on the inhi-
bition of binding of a radiolabeled standard peptide (HBV 
core 18–27 analogue, FLP 
SDY 
FPSV) and were performed as 
detailed elsewhere (Sidney et al., 2013). HLA molecules were 
purified by affinity chromatography from the EBV-trans-
formed homozygous cell line JY
, as described previously 
(Sidney et al., 2013). Peptides were tested at six different con-
centrations covering a 100,000-fold dose range in three or 
more independent assays, and the IC50 of the binding of the 
radiolabeled probe peptide was calculated. Under the con-
ditions used, where [radiolabeled probe] < [MHC] and IC50 
≥ [MHC], the measured IC50 values are reasonable approx-
imations of the true KD values (Cheng and Prusoff, 1973; 
Gulukota et al., 1997).
eLI 
sPot assays
Patient-derived and healthy donor–derived PBMCs were 
stimulated with 10 µg/ml H3.3K27M26–35 peptide or 
H3.3WT26–35 peptide, or flu peptide or without peptide. 
At 48 h, rhIL-2 (50 U/ml), IL-7 (10 ng/ml), and IL-15 (10 
ng/ml) were added to the culture for an additional 5 d. 5 
× 104 peptide-stimulated T cells were co-cultured with 5 
× 104 T2 cells pulsed with 10 µg/ml H3.3K27M26–35 pep-
tide or H3.3WT26–35 peptide or without peptide for 24 h on 
 
ELI 
SPOT plates coated with anti–human IFN-γ antibody. 
To determine TCR avidity, 5 × 104 TCR-transduced CD8+ 
T cells were co-cultured with 5 × 104 T2 cells pulsed with 
different concentrations of the H3.3K27M peptide over-
night on ELI 
SPOT plates coated with anti–human IFN-γ 
antibody. The rest of the protocol was performed according 
to the manufacturer’s protocol (human IFN-γ ELI 
SPOT kit; 
552138; BD). The spots were quantified using the CTL S6 
Universal-V Analyzer ELISpot Reader (ImmunoSpot).
Purification and Lc-Ms/Ms analysis of HLA class I peptides
HLA class I complexes were purified from 5 × 108 U87 pa-
rental cells or U87 cells transfected with either H3.3WT or 
H3.3K27M, as previously described (Bassani-Sternberg et 
al., 2015). In brief, cells were lysed with 0.25% sodium de-
oxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside 
(Sigma-Aldrich), 0.2 mM iodoacetamide, 1 mM EDTA, and 
1:200 protease inhibitor cocktail (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS at 
4°C for 1 h. The lysate was cleared by 30-min centrifugation 
at 40,000 g at 4°C. HLA class I complexes were immuno-
affinity-purified from the cleared lysate with protein A Sep-
harose beads (Invitrogen) covalently bound to the pan-HLA 
class I antibody W6/32 (purified from HB95 cells; ATCC) 
and eluted at room temperature with 0.1 N acetic acid. 
Eluted HLA-I complexes were then loaded on Sep-Pak tC18 
cartridges (Waters Corporation), and HLA class I peptides 
were separated from the complexes by eluting them with 
30% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA. Peptides were further 
purified using Silica C-18 column tips (Harvard Apparatus), 
eluted again with 30% ACN in 0.1% TFA, and concentrated 
by vacuum centrifugation. For LC-MS/MS analysis, HLA 
class I peptides were separated on an EASY
-nLC 1000 sys-
tem (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online to a Q Exac-
tive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with 
a nanoelectrospray ion source (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Peptides were loaded in buffer A (0.1% formic acid) into a 
50-cm-long, 75-µm-ID column in-house packed with Re-
proSil-Pur C18-AQ 1.9 µm resin (Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH) 
and eluted with a 90-min linear gradient of 5–30% buffer B 
(80% ACN and 0.1% formic acid) at a 250 nl/min flow rate. 
The Q Executive HF operated in a data-dependent mode 
with full MS scans at the range of 300–1,650 m/z, with res-
olution of 60,000 at 200 m/z and a target value of 3 × 106 
ions. The 10 most abundant ions with charge 1–3 were com-
bined to give an AGC target value of 1 × 105 and a maxi-
mum injection time of 120 ms, fragmented by high-energy 
collisional dissociation (HCD). MS/MS scans were acquired 
with a resolution of 15,000 at 200 m/z, and dynamic exclu-
sion was set to 20 s to avoid repeated peptide sequencing. 
Data were acquired and analyzed with the Xcalibur software 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). For the targeted identification 
of the H3.3K27M peptide, a heavy (Arg10) version of the 
peptide was synthetized with the Fmoc solid phase method 
using the ResPepMicroScale instrument (Intavis AG Bioana-
lytical Instruments), introducing a 10.0083-D mass difference 
with one 13C6 15N4 arginine (AnaSpec). The heavy peptide 
was added to each sample at a 1-pmol/µl concentration for a 
total of 3 pmol per run.
For MS data analysis, raw files were processed using 
MaxQuant version 1.5.7.12 as described previously (Bas-
sani-Sternberg et al., 2015). Searches were performed against 
the Human UniProt database (July 2015) and a customized 
reference database containing the H3.3K27M sequence. En-
zyme specificity was set as unspecific, and possible sequence 
matches were restricted to 8–15 amino acids and a maxi-
mum mass of 1500 D. N-terminal acetylation and methi-
onine oxidation were set as variable modifications. A false 
discovery rate of 0.01 was required at the peptide level. T
o 
identify the heavy peptide, an Arg10 label was added to the 
search type specification.

a humidified CO2 (5%) incubator. 6 d later, the immature 
dendritic cells were stimulated with recombinant human 
TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β (10 ng/ml each). Mature dendritic 
cells were then harvested on day 8, resuspended in AIM-V 
medium at 106 cells/ml with peptide (10 µg/ml), and incu-
bated for 2 h at 37°C. Populations of autologous CD8+ T 
cells were enriched from PBMCs using magnetic microbe-
ads (Miltenyi Biotec). CD8+ T cells (2 × 106 per well) were 
co-cultured with 2 × 105/well peptide-pulsed dendritic cells 
in 2 ml/well AIM-V medium supplemented with 5% human 
AB serum, 10 U/ml rhIL-2 (R&D Systems), and 10 units/
ml rhIL-7 (Cell Sciences) in each well of 24-well tissue cul-
ture plates. On day 15, lymphocytes were restimulated with 
autologous dendritic cells pulsed with peptide in AIM-V me-
dium supplemented with 5% human AB serum, rhIL-2, and 
rhIL-7 (10 units/ml each).

peptide synthesized by A&A Laboratories. PE-conjugated 
HLA-A*0201/RMS 
APS 
TGGV Dextramer was purchased 
from Immudex. Cells were stained with tetramer (10 µg/ml) 
or dextramer in PBS containing 1% BSA for 15 min at 4°C 
(for tetramer) or room temperature (for dextramer), followed 
by surface staining for various T cell markers at 4°C. Cells 
were then washed with PBS containing 0.1% BSA. For some 
experiments, T cells were stained with tetramer, followed 
by anti–human CD3 FITC (344803; BioLegend), CD4- 
PerCPCy.5.5 (317427; BioLegend), CD8 APC (344722; Bio-
Legend), CD69 FITC (11-0699-42; eBioscience), or PD-1- 
PECy7 (561272; BD Biosciences) along with the suitable 
isotype control antibodies. Intracellular cytokine staining 
was performed using Fixation/Permeabilization Solution kit 
(54714; BD Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. T cells were then stained with anti–human Gran-
zyme-B-BV421 (563389; BD Biosciences). The cells were 
acquired using a Sony SH800 flow cytometer and analyzed 
using FlowJo software v.10.

Medium was collected and centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min 
to remove debris. Human IFN-γ (555142; BD OptEIA) and 
human IL-2 (EH2IL2; Thermo Fisher Scientific) ELI 
SA was 
performed according to the manufacturers’ protocol. Plates 
were analyzed on a Biotek Synergy2 microplate reader (Biotek) 
at wavelengths of 450 nm and a background of 550 nm.
cloning of tcr
5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR was 
performed by SMA 
RT
er RACE 5′/3′ kit (634838; Clon-
tech). In brief, a single RACE-PCR product (∼900 bp) was 
excised from a 1.2% agarose gel, purified by Zymoclean Gel 
DNA Recovery kit (Zymo; D4001), and TOPO cloned into 
Pcr-Blunt II-TOPO using the Zero Blunt TOPO PCR 
Cloning kit (K2800-20SC; Life T
echnologies). The cloned 
product was then transformed into MAX Efficiency DH5α 
Competent cells (182580120; Life T
echnologies) and plated 
on ampicillin-containing LB agar plates (L1004; 
T
eknova). LB 
agar plates were placed at 37°C overnight to allow colonies 
to form. Selected clones from the resulting constructs were 
subjected to PCR amplification and sequencing (Quintara-
Bio) using the M13 (−21) forward primer (5′-TGT

Generation of sitcr retroviral producer cell lines
The siTCR system has been previously described (Okamoto 
et al., 2009, 2012). In brief, codon-optimized TCRA and 
TCRB fragments were artificially synthesized and cloned 
into Takara’s siTCR retroviral vector plasmid. The vector 
was constructed in the following sequence: murine stem cell 
virus (MSCV) 5′ LTR promoter driving the TCR as well as 
siRNA, siRNA cassette, TCRβ, Spacer + P2A peptide, fol-
lowed by TCRα sequence. The siRNA sequences were de-
signed to bind and silence the endogenous 
TCRα and 
TCRβ 
constant regions but were mismatched to the codon-opti-
mized TCRα and TCRβ constant regions of the H3.3K27M 
TCR. PG13 packaging cells were plated at 3 × 104 cells per 
well of a six-well plate and incubated for 24 h. PG13 cells 
were transfected with siTCR retroviral vector in the presence 
of 8 µg/ml polybrene and incubated for 4 h at 37°C, 5% 
CO2; this was repeated on the next day. 
The cells were further 
expanded, harvested as GaLV envelope pseudo-typed siTCR 
retroviral vector producer cells, and cryopreserved. For gener-
ation of retroviral particles, culture supernatant was collected 
from cells grown in complete DMEM supplemented with 
5 mM sodium butyrate (156-54-7; Sigma-Aldrich) for 24 h.
Production of recombinant tcr
Matured H3.3K27M TCR α and β ectodomains with an en-
gineered C-domain interchain disulfide bond were separately 
cloned into the pAcGP67a insect expression vector (554756; 
BD Biosciences) encoding either a C-terminal acidic zip-
per-biotin acceptor peptide-6xHis tag or a C-terminal basic 
zipper-6xHis tag. A 3c protease site was introduced between 
the C-terminal TCR (α or β) ectodomain and (acidic or 
basic) zipper sequence (Birnbaum et al., 2014). Baculoviruses 
for each TCR construct were produced in SF9 cells. TCR 
production was performed in High Five cells by transfect-
ing with appropriate ratio of TCRα and TCRβ viruses for 
48–72 h at 30°C. Harvested culture medium was incubated 
with Ni-NTA resin (30250; Qiagen) at room temperature for 
3 h and eluted in 1× Hepes-buffered saline (HBS) + 200 mM 
imidazole (pH 7.2). Eluted 
TCR was buffer-exchanged to 1× 
HBS and incubate with the appropriate amount of 3 C pro-
tease (100 ng/µl) at 4°C overnight. The reaction was then

purified via size-exclusion chromatography using an AKT 
APurifier (GE Healthcare) on a Superdex 200 column (GE 
Healthcare). Peak fractions were pooled and run on SDS-
PAGE gel as quality controls.
Soluble HLA-A2 loaded with H3.3K27M peptide 
(RMS 
APS 
TGGV) was prepared by in vitro folding. The 
HLA-A2 heavy chain (residues 1–275) and β2 microglobulin 
(residues 1–100) were separately cloned into pET
-26b vector 
and transformed by Rosseta DE3 Escherichia coli cells. Inclu-
sion bodies containing corresponding proteins were dissolved 
in 8 M urea, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, and 
10 mM DTT. For in vitro folding, the HLA-A2 heavy chain, 
β2-microglobulin, and H3.3K27M peptide were mixed in a 
1:2:10 molar ratio and diluted into a folding buffer contain-
ing 0.4 M l-arginine-HCl, 100 mM 
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM 
EDTA, 0.5 mM oxidized glutathione, and 5 mM reduced glu-
tathione (Garboczi et al., 1992). After 72 h at 4°C to dialyze 
against 10 liters of 10 mM Tris-HCl, the folding mixture was 
subjected on a weak ion exchange column (DEAE cellulose). 
Folded H3.3K27M-HLA-A2 was purified using sequential 
size exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 column) and 
ion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q columns).
sPr analysis
The interaction of the TCR with H3.3K27M pep-
tide-HLA-A2 was measured by SPR using a BIAcore T100 
biosensor at 25°C. Biotinylated H3.3K27M-HLA-A2 was 
immobilized on a streptavidin-coated BIAcore SA chip (GE 
Healthcare) at 300 resonance units (RU). A different flow cell 
was immobilized with nonrelevant peptide-HLA-A2 to serve 
as blank control. Different concentrations 1H5 TCR solu-
tion were flowed sequentially over blank and H3.3K27M-
HLA-A2. Injections of TCR were stopped 60 s after start of 
injections to allow sufficient time for SPR signals to reach 
plateau. Dissociation constants (KD) were obtained by fit-
ting equilibrium data with a 1:1 binding model using BIA-
core evaluation software.
Infection of primary t cells with tcr vector
Human PBMCs were activated on plates precoated with 
anti–human CD3 antibody (OKT3 clone; 170-076-124; 
Miltenyi Biotec) and RetroNectin (T100A; Takara Bio). 3 d 
after the stimulation, viral supernatant (for 
TCR-transduction 
groups) or PBS (for mock-transduction groups) was spun on 
separate RetroNectin-coated plates at 2,000 g for 2 h at 4°C. 
Activated PBMCs were harvested from the OKT3-Ret-
roNectin plates and added to the virus-coated plates using 
spinfection methodology at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4°C, and 
the cells were supplemented with 600 U/ml IL-2 (200-02; 
PeproT
ech). This transduction protocol was repeated on the 
next day, and PBMCs were allowed to rest for an additional 
4 d and then were stained with HLA-A*02:01-H3.3K27M 
tetramer to determine the transduction efficiency. The T cells 
were maintained in 100 U/ml rhIL-2-containing freshly 
made GT
-T551 medium (WK551S; Takara Bio).
LdH-based cytotoxicity assay
The CytoT
ox 96 nonradioactive cytotoxicity assay (Promega) 
was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Tar-
get cells were plated in 96-well plates with various effector/
target (E/T) ratios in 200 µl media for 24 h. 50 µl supernatant 
was then transferred to an enzymatic assay plate containing 
50 µl CytoT
ox 96 Reagent and incubated for 30 min at room 
temperature. Stop solution was then added to each well, and 
plates were analyzed at 490 nm on a Synergy2 microplate 
reader (Biotek). Percentage cytotoxicity was calculated as 
[(experimental – effector spontaneous – target spontaneous)/
(target maximum – target spontaneous)] × 100.
csFe-based cytotoxicity assay
Target cells were stained with CFSE using the Vybrant 
CFDA SE Cell Tracer kit (V12883; Thermo Fisher Scien-
tific). CFSE-labeled target cells (5 × 104/well) were incu-
bated with CTLs at the E/T ratio of 5 for 8 h. T
o block 
HLA-A2–mediated lysis, anti-HLA-A2 antibody (10 µg/ml; 
343302; BioLegend) was added to one group per experiment. 
At the end of incubation, 7-AAD (420403; BioLegend) was 
added into each well and incubated for 10 min on ice. The 
samples were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the killed tar-
get cells were identified as CFSE+7-AAD+ cells. Cytotoxic-
ity was calculated as the percentage of CFSE+ and 7-AAD+ 
cells in total CFSE+ cells.
therapy of mice bearing intracranial glioma xenografts
5–6-wk-old NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG mice) fe-
male mice (Jackson Laboratory) were used in the experiments. 
Animals were handled in the Animal Facility at the University 
of California, San Francisco (UCSF), per an Institutional An-
imal Care and Use Committee (IAC 
UC)-approved protocol. 
The procedure has been previously described by us (Ohno et 
al., 2013). In brief, using a stereotactic apparatus, mice received 
5×104 U87H3.3K27M luciferase-expressing cells/mouse in 
2 µl PBS at 2 mm lateral to the bregma and 3 mm below the 
surface of the skull. After tumors were established, each mouse 
received intravenous infusions of PBS, mock-transduced T 
cells, or 5 × 106 TCR-transduced T cells via the tail vein on 
days 14 and 30 after tumor inoculation. In some experiments, 
mice were killed at 2 or 10 d after T cell transfusion. Spleen, 
blood, lung, and tumors were harvested and enumerated for 
CD8, CD4, tetramer, granzyme-B, and PD-1.
Bioluminescence imaging
The growth of luciferase-positive U87H3.3K27M tumors in 
the brain was noninvasively monitored by BLI using the in 
vivo imaging system IVIS 100 (PerkinElmer). Mice received 
i.p. injections with 200 µl (15 mg/ml) of aqueous solution of 
d-luciferin potassium salt (PerkinElmer) and were anesthe-
tized with isoflurane, then imaged for bioluminescence for 1 
min of exposure time. The imaging of tumors was performed 
in a blinded fashion. Optical images were analyzed with the 
IVIS Living Image software package.
