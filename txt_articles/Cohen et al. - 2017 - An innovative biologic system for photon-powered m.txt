Coronary artery disease is one of the most common causes of death and disability, afflicting more than 15 million
Americans. Although pharmacological advances and revascularization techniques have decreased mortality, many
survivors will eventually succumb to heart failure secondary to the residual microvascular perfusion deficit that re-
mains after revascularization. We present a novel system that rescues the myocardium from acute ischemia, using
photosynthesis through intramyocardial delivery of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus. By using light
rather than blood flow as a source of energy, photosynthetic therapy increases tissue oxygenation, maintains myo-
cardial metabolism, and yields durable improvements in cardiac function during and after induction of ischemia. By
circumventing blood flow entirely to provide tissue with oxygen and nutrients, this system has the potential to create a
paradigm shift in the way ischemic heart disease is treated.
INTRODUCTION
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and
accounts for nearly $1 trillion in costs annually (1). Over the past several
decades, research and innovation have enabled advances in preventive,
pharmacologic, and surgical strategies to greatly augment the clinician’s
ability to treat once devastating cardiac events. Stemming from these
accomplishments, a wave of exploration into cardiac tissue regeneration
(2, 3) and angiogenesis (4, 5) has yielded exciting results in preclinical
models (6–8) and early clinical trials (9–11). Although these myocardial
repair strategies have great popularity, development of alternative and
uncharted pathways for the treatment of myocardial injury remains a
critical need. Here, we report an innovative method for correcting myo-
cardial ischemia by implementing a photosynthetic system where light,
rather than blood, fuels cardiomyocytes.
Synechococcus elongatus is a naturally occurring unicellular cyano-
bacterium that photosynthesizes across a broad wavelength spectrum. It
has traditionally been a research model for study of circadian rhythms
(12, 13) and, more recently, for enhanced production of biofuels using
CO2 as a carbon source. In addition, S. elongatus is easily engineered
genetically to manipulate its metabolic activity for enhanced production
of O2 and glucose (14, 15). On the basis of these characteristics, we hy-
pothesizedthatS.elongatuscouldbe usedinvivoto clearCO2andprovide
ischemiccardiomyocyteswiththeessentialO2andpotentiallyalsoglucose,
which are required for metabolic activity when blood flow is absent. In
essence, S. elongatus might balance a traditionally unbalanced equa-
tion in an ischemic milieu involving CO2, O2, H2O, and glucose. This
allows light to become a fuel source for cardiomyocytes while potentially
obviating the need for revascularization and restoration of perfusion.
Here, we demonstrate that delivery of S. elongatus, a photosynthetic
cyanobacterium, to the ischemic heart greatly augments cardiac per-
formance. Specifically, we found that cyanobacterial therapy increases
tissue oxygenation, preserves myocardial metabolism, and enhances cardiac
output (CO). Furthermore, this approach is nontoxic and does not elicit a
meaningful immune response. These results represent an entirely novel
strategy in leveraging photosynthesis to treat tissue ischemia, potentially
forming the foundation of a new generation of medical therapeutics.
RESULTS
S. elongatus coexists with cardiomyocytes under mammalian
physiological conditions in vitro and enhances cellular
metabolism during hypoxia
Before investigating whether S. elongatus can provide therapeutic ben-
efit to ischemic myocardium, we examined whether it tolerates physi-
ological conditions found in mammals. After propagating a pure strain
of S. elongatus and establishing a colony, we successfully cocultured the
cyanobacteria with isolated rat cardiomyocytes (Fig. 1A). S. elongatus did
not affect the survival of cardiomyocytes under standard conditions in
vitro, as demonstrated by a live/dead cell viability assay performed on
isolated neonatalrat cardiomyocytes cultured for 16hours withand with-
out S. elongatus (Fig. 1, B to D). We next evaluated whether S. elongatus
can actively undergo photosynthesis under mammalian physiological
conditions. Cardiomyocytes alone, S. elongatus at a concentration of
107 cells/ml, and cardiomyocytes with S. elongatus at a concentration
of 107 cells/ml were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) under both light and dark conditions
(Fig. 1E). Cultures with S. elongatus demonstrated significantly higher
oxygen levels under light than in dark condition, suggesting active
photosynthesis. Cardiomyocytes cocultured with S. elongatus in the light
trended toward higher oxygenation than did cardiomyocytes alone (P =
0.1). When compared to cultures containing S. elongatus alone, cardio-
myocytes cocultured with S. elongatus exhibited significantly reduced
oxygen levels under both light and dark conditions, suggesting that
cardiomyocytes are consuming the excess oxygen.

 on cardiomyocytes cocultured with 107 S. elongatus in normoxia, hypoxia
with light, and hypoxia in darkness (Fig. 1F). The hypoxia-light group
demonstrated a significant increase in cellular metabolism as compared
to the hypoxia-dark group, suggesting that the oxygen generated by
S. elongatus during photosynthesis may partially offset the cellular
stress induced by hypoxia.
To determine whether increased glucose influenced the findings of
enhanced metabolism, we investigated whether S. elongatus exports glu-
cose. We measured glucose levels in a concentrated solution of 5 × 108
S. elongatus in 200 ml of BG-11 and compared this to the same volume
of BG-11 alone under both light and dark conditions; glucose was un-
detectable in all samples.
Treatment of ischemic myocardium with S. elongatus
significantly increases tissue oxygenation during acute
myocardial infarction
To determine the effect of S. elongatus on tissue oxygenation, we used a
phosphorescent probe to measure oxygen tension at multiple time
points after ischemia in an acute myocardial infarction rodent model.
Use of a phosphorescent probe (16) enabled us to measure tissue oxy-
genation directly while avoiding off-target scatter from ventricular
blood. Briefly, oxygen tension was quantified at baseline and 10 min
after left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion with ini-
tiation of acute ischemia. At this point, animals were randomized to re-
ceive direct intramyocardial S. elongatus injection in the light, S. elongatus
injection in the dark, or saline alone. For experiments in the light,
injection syringes containing S. elongatus were prepared and kept in
the incubator under plant lights. For dark experiments, the injection
syringes were placed in opaque black bags to prevent light exposure.
In the S. elongatus (light) and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control
groups, the hearts were directly exposed to light after injection and for
the duration of the experiment. In the S. elongatus (dark) groups, injec-
tions were performed with dimmed room lights; after injection, room
lights were turned off and several layers of aluminum foil were placed
over the operative field to shield the heart from light exposure. Tissue
oxygen tension was reassessed at 10 and 20 min after injection. We
found that baseline oxygen levels were similar among all three groups

tion by cardiomyocytes. (F) Cellular viability was assessed using a WST-1 cell proliferation assay. Cardiomyocytes cultured with S. elongatus demonstrated significantly enhanced

 (Fig. 2A). In the light, S. elongatus–treated hearts demonstrated a nearly
25-fold increase in oxygenation levels from the nadir of ischemia at both
10 and 20 min after S. elongatus injection (Fig. 2B). By comparison, both
the hearts treated with S. elongatus in the dark and the saline-treated
group showed only a threefold increase in oxygen tension, likely
secondary to diffusion of atmospheric oxygen through the open-chest
incision. The finding of elevated tissue oxygenation is critical because it
forms the basis for enhanced myocardial bioenergetics (table S1).
Cyanobacterial therapy augments tissue metabolism during
acute ischemia
We next turned our attention to evaluating the myocardial metabolic
state in vivo. This was accomplished using FLIR thermal imaging
videography, an effective method for quantifying in vivo metabolic
activity (17). Between the light exposed control and S. elongatus
groups, no difference in baseline left ventricular (LV) surface tem-
perature was observed, with both groups demonstrating a similar rel-
ative decrease in temperature, as a ratio to baseline, in the ischemic
region after LAD ligation. At 10 min after injection, no significant dif-
ference between groups remained; however, at 20 min, the S. elongatus–
treated group demonstrated a significantly enhanced preservation of
surface temperature in the ischemic region (Fig. 2C). Representative
thermal images at these four time points are provided (Fig. 2D). The con-
trol group showed a steady decrease in ischemic region surface tempera-
ture over time, whereas the S. elongatus group demonstrated an increase
in local temperature from the time of ligation, indicating enhanced
metabolic activity (table S2).
S. elongatus therapy enhances ventricular function during
acute ischemia
We explored the immediate functional effects of cyanobacterial therapy
to determine whether enhanced tissue oxygenation and an up-regulated
myocardial metabolic state would improve cardiac mechanics. This was
performed using an ascending aortic flow probe for CO quantification
and an LV pressure-volume catheter for hemodynamic assessment at
baseline afterischemiainduction and45 minafterphotosynthetic therapy.
TherewasnobaselinedifferencebetweencontrolandS.elongatus–treated
groups with regard to the maximum LV pressure (Pmax), dP/dt, and CO.
However, at 45 min after intervention, the S. elongatus–treated animals
demonstrated augmented Pmax, dP/dt, and CO (Fig. 2, E to G), con-
sistent with enhanced ventricular contractility and overall cardiac per-
formance (table S3). On average, S. elongatus therapy in light resulted in
a nearly 30% increase in CO relative to S. elongatus therapy in the dark
and a nearly 60% increase in CO relative to the ischemic control. To
further test our hypothesis that only actively photosynthesizing cyano-
bacteria provide benefits, we also measured CO in animals that
underwent coronary ligation but received S. elongatus injections in
the dark. In this group, there was no significant increase in CO after
injection, supporting our hypothesis (Fig. 2G and table S4). We also
tested whether S. elongatus has any intrinsic effect on myocardial tissue
by injecting animals that did not undergo coronary ligation and
monitoring CO. No significant changes in CO from baseline were noted,
signifying that S. elongatus does not exert intrinsic inotropic or chro-
notropic effects on the myocardium (Fig. 2G and table S4).
S. elongatus therapy yields durable improvements in
ventricular performance after transient ischemia
After establishing the heart’s increased bioenergetic and functional state
immediately after photosynthetic S. elongatus administration during
acute ischemia, we next examined the long-term effects of this therapy.
To do this, we used an ischemia-reperfusion (IR) rodent model of cardio-
myopathy. Briefly, Wistar rats underwent a left thoracotomy to expose
the heart and enable consistent light exposure. The animals were ran-
domly selected for sham surgery or myocardial ischemia. In the myo-
cardial ischemia group, the LAD was temporarily occluded to induce
ischemia, and animals were randomized to receive injection with sa-
line alone or S. elongatus. After 60 min, the occlusion was removed to
allow for reperfusion of the ventricle over an additional 60 min while
exposed to light before chest closure. Animals were recovered and eval-
uated over a 4-week time frame. Biochemical analysis at 24 hours after
recovery revealed that serum troponin, a clinical marker of myocardial
injury and infarction, was significantly reduced in the S. elongatus–trea-
ted group (Fig. 3A). This finding suggests a long-term myocardial pro-
tective effect from photosynthesis-driven bioenergetics.
Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) analysis at the 4-week
time point revealed a significantly augmented LV ejection fraction and
reducedend-systolicvolumeinS.elongatus–treatedanimals(Fig.3,BtoE),
consistentwithimprovedcardiacfunctionandmitigatedpathologicremod-
eling. Further supporting this finding, intraventricular catheterization
demonstrated significantly improved LV contractility as determined by
theend-systolicpressure-volumerelationship(Fig.3,FtoH).Overall,these
findings strongly support a long-term protective benefit of photosynthetic
therapy, which translates to enhanced cardiac performance (table S5).
Cyanobacterial therapy is nontoxic and nonpathogenic
After demonstration of the benefits of cyanobacterial therapy, we eval-
uated the potential in vivo toxicity and immune response to the injected
microbes. Animals were randomized to receive an intravenous injection
of 1-ml saline control or 5 × 108 S. elongatus. Blood samples were then
acquired at multiple time points over a 1-week period to assess for in-
fection and immune response. Clinically, the animals demonstrated no
signs of infection. Blood cultures were also persistently negative for bac-
terial growth over the study period. Serial flow cytometry of serum indi-
cated no difference in CD8 T cell and CD19 B cell populations (Fig. 4A).
There was also no difference in the circulating CD4 population (Fig. 4B).
Along with evaluating the systemic immune response in animals re-
ceiving intravenous S. elongatus, we carried out immunohistochemistry
and histological analyses of cardiac tissue at various times after injection
to ascertain the local effects of S. elongatus injection. Immunohisto-
chemistry of tissue from the acute ischemia model, taken approximate-
ly 1 hour after injection, demonstrated a substantial tissue burden of
S. elongatus (Fig. 4C). By 24 hours afterinjection, nearly allinjectedcyano-
bacteria had been cleared, with only a small number of cells remaining in
theinterstitium(Fig.4D).Therewasnoobviousimmunereactionatthe1-
and 24-hour time points, and stains for major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) class II were negative. Animals from the IR model were used
todeterminelong-termlocaleffectsofS.elongatusinjection.Aftereuthanasia
of animals from the 4-week IR experiments, the hearts were explanted to
assess abscess formation and the presence of retained S. elongatus. Hema-
toxylin and eosin staining, as well as immunohistochemistry, showed no
evidence of eitherabscessformation orresidualS.elongatusat 4weeksafter
therapy (Fig. 4, E to H). These data suggest that S. elongatus therapy is
nontoxic and does not elicit a meaningful pathologic immune response.

thetic system as a means of correcting tissue ischemia. The S. elongatus

 use interstitial H2O and CO2 released by the oxygen-depleted cell and
convert it to glucose and O2 with light serving as the energy source. Glu-
cose produced by S. elongatus is retained by the cyanobacterium them-
selves and likely does not benefit ischemic cardiomyocytes; however,
oxygen levels are significantly increased. By helping balance a patholog-
ically unbalanced equation, cardiomyocytes are protected, translating to
improved cardiac function. The data show that S. elongatus can be ef-
ficiently used, allowing fordirect delivery to ischemic myocardium. This
treatmentresultedinaugmentedtissueoxygenation,increasedmyocardial

enhanced LV function in an ischemic setting. Although the absolute in-
crease in CO inS.elongatus(light)injectionscompared to theS. elongatus
(dark) injections seems relatively small and is somewhat variable, on
average, it resulted in a nearly 30% increase in CO. In humans, an in-
crease of this magnitude would have profound clinical implications,
likely representing the difference between a healthy patient and one
suffering from heart failure. Immunologic analysis demonstrated no

 of 5 × 108 S. elongatus cells, blood cultures remained negative and the
animals showed no clinical signs of infection for the duration of the
1-week observation period. The persistence of S. elongatus in the tissue
is likely short-lived, with most of the injected cells cleared from the
tissue by 24 hours. As such, this proposed therapy holds most potential
in situations where a temporary supply of oxygen is required, such as
during acute myocardial infarction before revascularization.
As briefly mentioned, increased tissue oxygenation forms the basis
for enhanced myocardial bioenergetics. By allowing aerobic respiration
to occur, adenosine triphosphate production isgreatly enhanced, whereas
lactic acid release is mitigated with the decrease in anaerobic glycolysis.
Clinically, this principle is used universally as providers strive to revas-
cularize ischemic myocardium as quickly as possible in the setting of a
myocardial infarction (18). In this model, by quickly restoring oxygen-
ation after an acute LAD occlusion, the heart demonstrated increased
metabolic activity and improved ventricular function. Using S. elongatus
to mitigate acute tissue ischemia has a range of possibilities, including its
use as an adjunctive cardioplegia during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery
or as a transplant organ perfusate to provide tissue with oxygen in the
absence of blood flow during transport.

 In addition to restoring oxygenation during ischemia, S. elongatus
therapy may also exert beneficial effects after the restoration of blood
flow. It has been demonstrated that, even after revascularization with
coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention,
a significant residual microvascular perfusion deficit remains (19, 20).
This leads to progressive ventricular remodeling (21), ischemic cardio-
myopathy, heart failure, and death (22), which many survivors of acute
myocardial infarction will eventually succumb to. Angiogenic cytokine
and stem cell–based therapies have been studied to address these issues;
however, these treatments can take days to weeks to induce a substantial
therapeutic response, potentially limiting the amount of myocardium
that can be salvaged. S. elongatus, either alone or as an adjunct to cell
or cytokine therapies, may be an effective means of addressing micro-
vascular disease and mitigating the development of the late ischemic
cardiomyopathy.
Our IR experiments support the fact that this strategy may be effec-
tive and translatable. We demonstrated that 2 hours of active therapy
while the heart was exposed to light resulted in significant functional
benefits and preserved ventricular architecture 4 weeks later. These
benefits are presumably due to increased tissue oxygenation during
the period of hypoxia, allowing a greater number of cells to survive until
blood flow is restored. Although it is possible that the cyanobacteria
alleviate microvascular perfusion deficits after reperfusion, resulting in
additional benefits, it is not possible to quantify this with certainty; this is
a limitation of our study. Despite these limitations, the observed benefits
do have significant clinical implications, indicating that S. elongatus
therapy could be used as an immediate adjunct to current medical in-
terventions for patients suffering an acute myocardial infarction. A
limiting factor to this particular application is the need for the tissue
to be in direct light, necessitating an open incision for the delivery of
photons, because most cases of acute myocardial infarction are treated
in the cardiac catheterization suite. However, recently, a new chlorophyll
pigment, chlorophyll f, that absorbs light in the infrared spectrum, was
identified in other cyanobacteria (23); using a strain of cyanobacteria
active in the far-red spectrum couldpotentially allow fortranscutaneous
delivery of energy. Combining transcutaneous energy delivery with per-
cutaneous or intracoronary administration of S. elongatus would be a
promising step toward human translation. Genetically engineering
S. elongatus to actively export glucose has been described. S. elongatus
produces intracellular sucrose to balance osmolarity in its saltwater
environment; thisfeature can be exploited to create a strain of S. elongatus
that produces and exports high levels of carbohydrates (24). By using
homologous recombination, the Zymomonas mobiles invA gene that
codes for invertase can be introduced, which allows intracellular sucrose
tobecleavedintofructoseandglucosebeforebeingactivelyextracellularly
exported along with the glf gene encoding a glucose/fructose-facilitated
diffusion transporter (15). Extracellular sodium chloride concentration
can then be manipulated to adjust the amount of glucose produced. We
have preliminarily explored this technique, creating a plasmid contain-
ing these genes and creating an enhanced glucose producing strain of
S. elongatus through transformation with some early success. This avenue
of research could substantially improve the efficacy of cyanobacterial
therapy and bring the technology closer to clinical translation.
Although extremely different from any known strategy addressing
myocardial ischemia, the use of S. elongatus to provide ischemic cardio-
myocytes with oxygen via photosynthesis represents a novel and poten-
tiallyfeasibleapproachto treating theischemic heart. BecauseS.elongatus
is amenable to genetic engineering (25), there are countless possibilities
regarding the augmentation of energy production, in vivo tracking, and
growth control. Although obstacles exist, as with any new therapy in its
infancy, the data suggest a very real benefit from the use of photo-
synthesis to treat ischemic disease. In addition, the ability to treat
ischemic tissue without the need for blood flow has far-reaching im-
plications beyond just the ischemic heart. Thus, the next stage of de-
veloping this photosynthetic strategy will focus on elucidating and
proving the exact mechanisms coupled with enhancing clinical translat-
ability with biomedical engineering.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Propagation of S. elongatus
One frozen S. elongatus vial (catalog no. A14259, Life Technologies
Corporation) was transferred from the −80°C freezer onto dry ice.
Thirty milliliters of room temperature Gibson BG-11 medium (catalog
no. A1379902, Life Technologies) was added to one baffled bottom flask
with vented cap (catalog no. 4116-0125, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.).
Cells were quickly thawed in a 35°C water bath without agitating the
vial. The full content was transferred into a flask containing culture
medium. The culture was placed on a rotating incubator (model no. 420,
Thermo Electron Corporatio) running at 34°C and 125 rpm. A lamp
with two 18-inch plant fluorescent light bulbs (F18T8 PL/AQ, General
Electric) was placed on the incubator to allow light to reach the culture.
Initial outgrowth of the culture took 5 to 7 days. The culture was main-
tained by adding fresh BG-11 medium daily to replace evaporative losses
and maintain a constant volume. Every 4 days, or whenever the colony
becomes noticeably oversaturated, as indicated by clumping or sediment
collecting at the bottom of the flask, approximately 25% of the colony was
discarded and replaced with an equal volume of fresh BG-11.
In vitro experimental model
Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 3-day-old neonatal rats using
an isolation kit (Pierce Primary Cardiomyocyte Isolation Kit, Thermo
Fisher Scientific Inc.) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. On
24-well tissue culture plates, three wells were plated with isolated cardio-
myocytes at a density of 500,000 cells per well, three wells were plated
with the same density of cardiomyocytes along 107 S. elongatus, three
wells contained 107 S. elongatus alone, and three wells contained cell
growth medium alone. Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10%
FBSwasusedasthegrowthmediumforallwells.Theplateswerecultured
at 37°C for 16 hours under various conditions depending on the exper-
iment. For experiments comparing the effect of S. elongatus in light
and dark conditions the above-mentioned 18-inch fluorescent plant
bulbs were used as the light source; dark samples were placed in
opaque black bags to prevent light exposure. For experiments requiring
hypoxia, we created a hypoxic environment using vacuum-sealed bags
and a hypoxic gas mixture containing 1% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide,
and nitrogen balance (Praxair Inc.). The bags were flushed with hypoxic
gas for approximately 5 min to ensure that all atmospheric air was
expelled before being heat-sealed. In vitro oxygen measurements were
obtained as described below. To assess cellular viability, a live/dead
viability/cytotoxicity assay (catalog no. L3224, Thermo Fisher Scientific
Inc.) was performed and analyzed using fluorescent microscopy (Leica
DMi8, Leica). Briefly, red fluorescent ethidiumhomodimer-1wasusedto
stain thenuclei of deadcells(those without intact plasmamembranes),and
green fluorescent calcein-acetoxymethyl was used to mark intracellular
esterase activity of living cells. Dead cells were visible as small red spheres,
whereas the cytoplasm of living cells was green. S. elongatus autofluores-
cenced at the same wavelength as the emission wavelength of the red

 fluorescent dye that bound to dead animal cells and showed up as
thin red rods. The Fiji distribution of ImageJ and built-in Cell Counter
plugin were used to count the number of live and dead cells (26). The
live/dead experiments were performed in triplicate, and three images
were obtained for each well. A grid was first created on each image
using ImageJ; next, the Cell Counter plugin was used to mark and
count the number of live and dead cells. The total cell count was
calculated by adding the number of live cells to the number of dead
cells, which was averaged before statistical analysis. To measure cellu-
lar metabolism, a WST-1 cell proliferation assay (catalog no. ab155902,
Abcam plc.) was performed and analyzed on a plate reader (Synergy 2,
BioTek). For experiments requiring the measurement of glucose, a
sucrose/fructose/D-glucose assay was used (K-SUFRG, Megazyme
International Ltd. Bray Co.) according to the manufacturer’s instruc-
tions. Electron microscopy was performed on a field emission scan-
ning electron microscope (Zeiss Sigma FESEM, Carl Zeiss AG) with
the following settings: electronic high tension, 2.00 kV; working dis-
tance, 5.2 mm; signal A, InLens; and magnification, 5.73 KX (fig. S1).
A raster graphics editor (Adobe Photoshop CC 2015.5, Adobe Systems)
was used to create a false-colored scanning electron micrograph (fig. S2).
In vitro oxygen tension measurements
Phosphorescence lifetime measurements were used to measure in vitro
oxygen tension using a NEOFOX-GT optical oxygen sensor with a
phosphor coating baked onto the glass fiber (Ocean Optics). The probe
was calibrated using nitrogen bubbled through water for the 0% reading,
and water was equilibrated with the atmosphere for the 20.9% reading.
The integrated software included with the system was used to interpret
the optical signal, convert to torr, and acquire data. Temperature cor-
rection was achieved with a thermistor probe.
Rat model of acute myocardial ischemia and IR
For both the acute myocardial ischemia and IR models, male Wistar
rats (300 to 350 g) were sedated in an isoflurane chamber, intubated
with a 16-gauge angiocatheter, and mechanically ventilated (Hallowell)
on 2.0% isoflurane maintenance.
Inthe acute myocardial infarction model, the right carotidartery was
dissected free, and an SPR-869 pressure-volume catheter (Millar) was
introduced into the left ventricle via the carotid. A median sternotomy
was then performed, and the ascending aorta was dissected free for
placement of a flow probe (Transonic) to continuously monitor CO
(fig. S3). Baseline hemodynamics were then acquired. To induce myo-
cardial ischemia, we permanently occluded the LAD with a 6-0 poly-
propylene suture 2 mm below the level of the left atrial appendage.
After 15 min, hemodynamic data were collected, and animals were ran-
domized (n = 5 per group) to receive intramyocardial injections of either
PBS or 1 × 106 S. elongatus suspended in PBS directly to the ischemic
territory. We prepared the S. elongatus injections first by determin-
ing the concentration of the culture. The proper number of cyano-
bacteria was then collected by centrifugation, the medium was aspirated,
and dilutions were prepared by resuspending the cells in the proper
volume of PBS to obtain a concentration of 1 × 106 cells in 100 ml. For
injections performed in the light, injection syringes were kept in the
incubator under plant lights after preparation but before injection (ap-
proximately 2 hours). After injection, the heart and surrounding tissues
were directly exposed to light for the remainder of the acute ex-
periments and until chest closure in the IR experiments. For injections
in the dark, after the injection syringes were prepared, they were placed
in black opaque bags, shielding them from light inside the incubator.
During injection, room lights were turned off, and only the minimum
amount of indirect light needed by the surgeon to see the operative
field was used. After injection, lights were turned off completely, and
the operative field was covered with several layers of aluminum foil
to shield the tissue from inadvertent light exposure for the remainder
of the acute experiments and until chest closure in the IR model. In
the IR model, chest closure was performed with only the minimum
amount of indirect light needed by the surgeon to see the operative
field. For intramyocardial injections, we used a 31-gauge insulin
syringe with the needle bent slightly to enter parallel to the endocar-
dium. Before injection, we drew back slightly on the plunger of the
syringe to ensure that the needle was not intraventricular; we visually
checked for wheal formation as we injected for further confirmation
that the injection was intramyocardial. Both groups were exposed to
high-intensitydirectlightthroughtheopen-chestincision. Hemodynamics
were then serially acquired every 15 min for 45 min until the animals
were euthanized at 45 min. In addition, intramyocardial oxygen ten-
sion and thermal imaging was acquired at baseline, at time of ische-
mia, and at 10 and 20 min after injection, as described in further detail
below. After the initial acute experiments, additional control groups
were included in the analysis, including injecting S. elongatus under
dark conditions in animals after coronary ligation (n = 5), as well as
injecting S. elongatus in animals that did not undergo coronary liga-
tion (n = 5). Intramyocardial oxygen tension and CO were acquired as
described above.
For the IR model, a left thoracotomy was used. Animals were ran-
domized to receive sham surgery (n = 7) or myocardial ischemia (n =
17). The LAD was temporarily occluded with a 6-0 polypropylene
suture, which was passed through a segment of small plastic tube and
then clamped with a hemostat to fashion a tourniquet. Animals were
then randomized to receive injection with PBS control (n = 7) or 1 ×
106 S. elongatus suspended in PBS (n = 10). After 60 min under direct
light condition, the tourniquet was removed from the LAD and reper-
fusion with an open chest under direct light was allowed to occur for an
additional 60 min before closing the chest and recovering the animal.
Serum was collected at 24 hours to assess for troponin level. At 4 weeks,
animals underwent cardiac MRI. Imaging was performed using a 7-T
VNMRS horizontal bore scanner (Varian Inc.) with a shielded gradient
system (400 mT/m). Both two- and four-chamber cines were acquired.
Functional and architectural analysis was performed in a blinded fashion.
After cardiac MRI, animals underwent LV catheterization for hemo-
dynamic assessment as described, followed by euthanasia. Baseline LV
pressure-volume loops were unable to be obtained because LV catheter-
ization is a terminal procedure in rats. After euthanasia, the hearts were
explanted for immunohistochemistry and histological analysis, as de-
scribed in further detail below.
Intramyocardial oxygen tension acquisition
Phosphorescence lifetime measurements were performed using a
PMOD-5000 phosphorometer (Oxygen Enterprises). The PMOD-
5000 is a frequency domain instrument operating in the range of 100
to100,000Hz.Themeasuredphosphorescencelifetimeswereindependent
of local phosphor concentration and insensitive to the presence of en-
dogenous tissue fluorophores and chromophores. The excitation light
was transmitted to the measurement site through a glass fiber bundle,
and the emission was collected by another 3-mm-diameter glass fiber
bundle (center-to-center distance of 6 mm). The emission was passed
througha695-nmlong-passglass filter(Schott glass) anddetected by an
avalanche photodiode (Hamamatsu). The resulting photocurrent was

 converted into voltage, amplified, digitized, and transferred to a
computer for analysis. Data were acquired at baseline, at time of is-
chemia, and at 10 and 20 min after injection.
Thermal imaging
For thermal imaging to assess surface myocardial heat emission and ex-
amine metabolic activity, FLIRA655sc camera wasused.Carewastaken
to maintain a constant body temperature with a heating pad. In addi-
tion, the camera was precisely placed and mechanically stabilized 30 cm
above the chest. At 20 min after cyanobacteria injection, thermal images
were acquired and then analyzed with FLIR software to determine my-
ocardial surface temperature.
Immunological analysis and flow cytometry
Male Wistar rats were sedated and intravenously administered with
either saline (n = 4) or 5 × 108 cyanobacteria (n = 4). Before adminis-
tration, blood samples were acquired for flow cytometry to examine in-
flammatory markers. At 16 hours after administration, blood was
acquired for culture and flow cytometry. This was repeated at 40 and
88 hours. Blood cultures were performed at the Stanford Animal Diag-
nostic Laboratory. Flow cytometry was performed by placing 100 ml
of peripheral blood into BD Microcontainer tubes with dipotassium
EDTA. Blood was transferred into 5-ml polystyrene Falcon tubes
with 4-ml ammonium chloride and Na acetate buffer and remained
on ice for 10 min. The red blood cell lysis was repeated a second time.
The pellet was rinsed in PBS + 2% FBS, and cells were stained for mem-
brane proteins (CD19, CD8, CD11b, and Ly-6G) for 1 hour in a 4°C
cold room. Cells were resuspended in 200 ml of PBS, and flow cytometry
analysis was carried out on BD Biosciences LSR II at the Stanford
Shared FACS Facility.
Immunohistochemistry and histology
Immunohistochemistry and histology samples were taken at various
time points after injection. In animals from the acute experiments, eu-
thanasia was performed with potassium chloride after data collection
approximately 1 hour after injection, and the hearts were explanted
and prepared, as described below. In animals from the IR experiment,
at 4 weeks’ posttherapy after euthanasia, the hearts were explanted for
analysis. Whole-heart specimens were immediately flushed with PBS,
injected retrograde with Tissue-Tek optimum cutting temperature
(OCT) (Sakura) through the aorta and pulmonary artery, submerged
in OCT., frozen at −80°C, and sectioned onto glass slides using a Leica
CM3050S cryostat (Leica) at a thickness of 10 mm. Next, the samples
were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and blocked with 10% FBS.
For immunohistochemistry of acute and 24-hour injection specimens,
sections were stained with cardiac troponin primary antibody at 1:200
dilution (ab39807, Abcam) with Alexa Fluor 405 secondary antibody at
1:200 dilution (ab175664, Abcam), and MHC class II primary antibody
at 1:200dilution (ab116378, Abcam)with AlexaFluor488secondary anti-
body (ab150065, Abcam) at 1:200 dilution. For immunohistochemistry
of IR specimens, sections were stained with cardiac troponin primary
antibody at 1:200 dilution (ab47003, Abcam) and a fluorescein isothio-
cyanate secondary antibody (ab6717, Abcam) at a 1:200 dilution and
counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Vector Labora-
tories). The sections were imaged with a Leica DM5000B fluorescent
microscope and a Leica DMi8 fluorescent microscope. The S. elongatus
were fluorescent at the 596-nm red channel of the scope. For histolog-
ical analysis, sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for
assessment of abscess presence.
