ABSTRACT
Objective: Randomized trials support carotid endarterectomy (CEA) in asymptomatic patients with $60% internal
carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. The widely referenced Society for Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Statement on
carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS) imaging indicates that an ICA peak systolic velocity (PSV) $230 cm/s corresponds to a
$70% ICA stenosis, leading to the potential conclusion that asymptomatic patients with an ICA PSV $230 cm/s would
benefit from CEA. Our goal was to determine the natural history stroke risk of asymptomatic patients who might have
undergone CEA based on consensus statement PSV of $230 cm/s but instead were treated medically based on more
conservative CDUS imaging criteria.
Methods: All patients who underwent CDUS imaging at our institution during 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. The
year 2009 was chosen to ensure extended follow-up. Asymptomatic patients were included if their ICA PSV was $230 cm/s
but less than what our laboratory considers a $80% stenosis by CDUS imaging (PSV $430 cm/s, end-diastolic velocity
$151 cm/s, or ICA/common carotid artery PSV ratio $7.5). Study end points included freedom from transient ischemic
attack (TIA), freedom from any stroke, freedom from carotid-etiology stroke, and freedom from revascularization.
Results: Criteria for review were met by 327 patients. Mean follow-up was 4.3 years, with 85% of patients having >3-year
follow-up. Four unheralded strokes occurred during follow-up at <1, 17, 25, and 30 months that were potentially attributable
to the index carotid artery. Ipsilateral TIA occurred in 17 patients. An additional 12 strokes occurred that appeared unrelated to
ipsilateral carotid disease, including hemorrhagic events, contralateral, and cerebellar strokes. Revascularization was
undertakenin59patients,1forstroke,12forTIA,and46forasymptomaticdisease.Actuarialfreedomfromcarotid-etiologystroke
was 99.7%, 98.4%, and 98.4% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively. Freedom from TIA was 98%, 96%, and 95%, freedom from any
stroke was 99%, 96%, and 93%, and freedom from revascularization was 95%, 86%, and 81% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively.
Conclusions: Patients with intermediate asymptomatic carotid stenosis (ICA PSV 230-429 cm/s) do well with medical
therapy when carefully monitored and intervened upon using conservative CDUS criteria. Furthermore, a substantial
number of patients would undergo unnecessary CEA if consensus statement CDUS thresholds are used to recommend
surgery. Current velocity threshold recommendations should be re-evaluated, with potentially important implications for
upcoming clinical trials. (J Vasc Surg 2017;65:1029-38.)
Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death among
United States citizens and represents a substantial
burden on the health care economic system.1 As a major
risk factor for stroke, carotid artery stenosis is estimated
to affect nearly 12% of Americans aged >70 years.2 In
an effort to combat this problem and decrease stroke
risk, a substantial amount of time and resource allocation
has been devoted toward determining the most appro-
priate threshold for revascularization.3-5 As a conse-
quence, carotid endarterectomy (CEA) has emerged as
one of the most common operations performed by
vascular surgeons in contemporary practice. Further-
more, with the advent of carotid artery stenting (CAS),
nonsurgical specialties have also begun to treat carotid
disease, leading to a rapid rise in the number of patients
who undergo revascularization.6,7
Although there is little debate whether to treat those
with symptomatic stenosis, the optimal management
of
asymptomatic
patients
has
been
called
into
question,8,9
because
approximately
two-thirds
of
revascularization procedures performed in the United
States are for asymptomatic disease.6 Despite level 1

 investigators have suggested that medical therapy has
improved to a point that trial results no longer apply.8
Conversely, additional published reports suggest there

To compound the problem of clarifying the natural
history of asymptomatic carotid disease, no standard
carotid duplex ultrasound (CDUS) criteria exist to guide
duplex classification of disease severity. Randomized
trials support CEA in asymptomatic patients with a
$60% stenosis, however the most appropriate CDUS
thresholds to determine this level of disease remain
unknown.13-17 The widely referenced Society for Radiolo-
gists in Ultrasound Consensus Statement on CDUS
criteria has indicated that an internal carotid artery
(ICA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) of $230 cm/s be used
as the criterion to establish $70% stenosis.18 However,
as previously demonstrated by Arous et al,19 substantial
variation exists in institutional protocols for determining
the degree of stenosis and, presumably, the threshold
for intervention. This ambiguity has a potential effect
not only on patient outcomes but almost certainly also
on health care costs.20
Our institution has a long-standing interest in CDUS
validation21
and
has
developed
stringent,
internally
validated, criteria for the degree of stenosis based on
the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterec-
tomy Trial (NASCET) method.22 Our CDUS criteria for
$80% stenosis are ICA PSV $430 cm/s, end-diastolic
velocity $151 cm/s, and ICA-to-common carotid artery ra-
tio $7.5. Compared with other published criteria, these
thresholds are relatively high,19 and therefore, a signifi-
cant portion of our patients enter surveillance. The pur-
pose of this study is to report the natural history of
patients with asymptomatic carotid disease who were
managed using these conservative CDUS criteria. In
addition, we propose to determine the fraction of strokes
in this population that are potentially preventable by
prophylaxis with CEA or CAS.
METHODS
This study was conducted in compliance with the
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at
the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth. All patient
personal health information was protected, records and
outcomes were deidentified, and no testing or proced-
ures were required for this study. Thus, the need for
specific consent was waived.
Data collection and patient identification. All patients
who underwent CDUS imaging from January 1, 2009, to
December 31, 2009, were retrospectively identified using
a prospectively maintained vascular laboratory database.
The year 2009 was chosen to ensure adequate follow-up
(mean follow-up, 4.3 years). Patient demographics and
comorbidities
were
collected.
Comorbidities
were
defined as having a documented diagnosis on history
and physical examination at the time of the index CDUS
study. Surveillance CDUS studies were examined for
standard velocity criteria, change in velocities over time,
and presence of a previous CEA, CAS, or occlusion.
Medical and surgical management were noted. If the
patient appeared to be lost to follow-up, contact by
telephone of the patient or his or her primary care
physician was attempted.
The Dartmouth-Hitchcock vascular laboratory duplex
velocity criteria for percentage stenosis have been stan-
dardized
against
conventional
carotid
angiography
(Fig 1).4,21,22 All CDUS criteria undergo annual validation
for accuracy by a senior registered vascular technician
and senior vascular surgeon. Further detail about our
institutions

Appendix (online only).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were eligible
for inclusion if they had at least one asymptomatic
carotid artery under surveillance that had not previ-
ously undergone an intervention with CEA or CAS.
Patients were considered asymptomatic according to
the
definition
set
by
the
Asymptomatic
Carotid
Surgery Trial3 and the Asymptomatic Carotid Athero-
sclerosis Study.4 We chose ICA PSV $230 cm/s as the
minimum velocity for inclusion based on the Society
for Radiologists in Ultrasound Consensus Statement
criterion for $70% stenosis.18 We excluded 29 patients
who met the criteria for $80% stenosis at our own
institution.
In
this
manner,
we
created
a
patient
cohort
with
asymptomatic
intermediate
carotid
stenosis.
When patients had undergone an ipsilateral CDUS study
in prior years, we chose the duplex in 2009 as a starting
point for time calculation to minimize selection bias. Prior
duplex scans occurred in 243 patients (74%) and were
accounted for in the analysis. Patients were not eligible
for review if they had previously undergone CEA or CAS
or if the indication was not for atherosclerotic disease
(eg, fibromuscular dysplasia, trauma or spontaneous
ARTICLE HIGHLIGHTS
d Type of Research: Retrospective cohort study
d Take Home Message: In 327 asymptomatic patients
with intermediate carotid stenosis (peak systolic
velocity 230-429 cm/s) only four unheralded strokes
occurred that were attributable to the ipsilateral ca-
rotid artery during a mean follow-up of >4 years.
d Recommendation: These data suggest that future
prospective randomized trials for management of
asymptomatic carotid stenosis should address the
optimal ultrasound thresholds for interventions.

 dissection). Presence of a contralateral $80% stenosis
was noted and included as a baseline characteristic for
analysis.
End points and definitions. Study end points included
freedom from progression to transient ischemic attack
(TIA), freedom from any stroke, freedom from carotid-
etiology stroke, and freedom from revascularization.
TIA was defined as progression to ipsilateral neuro-
logic
symptoms,

no
evidence
of
stroke
on
magnetic
resonance
imaging,
or
by
resolution
of
symptoms
#24
hours
if
no
magnetic
resonance
imaging was available. Critical ($80%) stenosis was
defined as having any of the velocity criteria shown in
Fig 1 because this is our institutional standard. Carotid-
etiology stroke was defined as a stroke event that was
determined to be due to the ipsilateral carotid artery
after independent blinded review of all neurologic
events
by
a
board-certified
vascular
surgeon
and
stroke neurologist. Stroke events that were felt to be
of carotid origin by either specialty were included for
this end point.
Statistical analysis. Patients
were
only
allowed
to
contribute one artery to the analysis. Bilateral asymp-
tomatic disease was noted and included as a baseline
characteristic. Bilateral asymptomatic stenosis meeting
criteria for review was found in 28 patients (9% of
patients),
and
the
carotid
chosen
for
analysis
was
determined
at
random.
Kaplan-Meier
analysis
was
used
to
determine
freedom
from
TIA,
any
stroke,
carotid-etiology stroke, and revascularization. Life tables
were created for all outcomes. A sensitivity analysis was
conducted to ensure that the random selection of a
single carotid in patients with bilateral disease did not
provide
dissimilar
results.
Life
tables
comparing
all
eligible carotid arteries to randomly selected carotids
in bilateral disease cases showed no significant differ-
ence in outcomes. Patients were censored from clinical
event life tables at revascularization, loss to follow-up,
or death. Patients were censored from revasculariza-
tion at loss to follow-up or death. Survival curves were
truncated at 5 years and thus do not show a small
number of events occurring after that time. Cox pro-
portional hazard modeling was performed to deter-
mine factors associated with progression to symptoms,
stroke, and revascularization. Statistical analyses were
performed using Stata software (StataCorp LP, College
Station, Tex).
RESULTS
Cohort characteristics. During the study interval, 426
patients met the inclusion criteria. Symptomatic status
or severe stenosis ($80% by local duplex criteria) at
presentation was present in 99 patients, leaving 327
patients for analysis. The mean age at the time of
the index study was 73 years (standard deviation,
8.5 years), and 51% were male. The majority were
receiving antiplatelet (94%) or statin (80%) therapy.
Comorbid conditions and risk factors were typical for
this patient population (Table I). Mean follow-up was
4.3 years.
Clinical outcomes. Progression to TIA occurred in 17 pa-
tients (Table II). Kaplan-Meier freedom from TIA was 98%,

 96% and 95% at 1, 3, and 5 years, respectively (Fig 2).
Revascularization was undertaken in 12 TIA patients (12
CEA and 0 CAS), and five were managed medically
because
of
patient
preference
or
severe
comorbid
illness. No strokes (carotid-etiology or other) occurred in
patients
who
progressed
to
TIA,
including
those
managed medically.
Unheralded stroke occurred in 16 patients, with actu-
arial freedom from any stroke of 99%, 96%, and 93% at
1, 3, and 5 years (Fig 3). Twelve of these stroke events
(75%) were not attributable to the ipsilateral carotid
artery after independent adjudication by a vascular
surgeon and stroke neurologist. The 12 strokes were
managed medically. The ipsilateral carotid artery was
the most likely culprit lesion in four stroke events,
with freedom from carotid-etiology stroke of 99.7%,
98.4%, and 98.4% at 1, 3, and 5 years (Fig 4). Of the
four patients who sustained a carotid-etiology stroke,
one underwent CEA and the remaining three were
managed medically at the patient’s request (Table III).
When stratified by level of stenosis found on the index
CDUS study, no association was found between the
level of stenosis (50%-59%, 60%-69%, and 70%-79%)
for TIA (P ¼ .18), carotid-etiology stroke (P ¼ .84), or
any stroke (P ¼ .81).
CEA was undertaken in 56 patients and CAS in three
patients, with a total freedom from revascularization
of 95%, 86%, and 81% at 1, 3, and 5 years (Fig 5). The
indication
for
revascularization

and

all patients.
Predictive variables. Individual Cox proportional haz-
ard models were created to determine factors associated
with the primary end points. Progression to TIA was asso-
ciated with an increase in the ICA PSV to $430 cm/s
(hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; 95% confidence interval [CI],
1.3-11;
P ¼ .02) as well as a
baseline ICA PSV of
>302 cm/s (HR, 3; 95% CI, 1.04-8.5; P ¼ .04). Too few
carotid-etiology
stroke
events
occurred to
create a
meaningful model predictive of this outcome. However,
hazard modeling found an association with any-cause
stroke for congestive heart failure (HR, 4.4; 95% CI, 1.3-15;
P ¼ .02) and prior contralateral CEA (HR, 4.2, 95% CI,
1.4-13; P ¼ .01). As expected, progression to severe stenosis
by duplex criteria was associated with revascularization,
whereas low baseline end-diastolic velocity was protec-
tive. Prior contralateral neurologic symptoms #6 months
was associated with all-cause mortality (HR, 3.6; 95% CI,
1.2-10.8; P ¼ .02). Additional comorbidities, including
hemodialysis, congestive heart failure, chronic pulmo-
nary disease, or diabetes, were also associated with death
(Table IV).

 (ICA PSV 230-429 cm/s) using conservative CDUS criteria.
These individuals are at risk for stroke; however, it is the
minority of these strokes that are attributable to the ipsi-
lateral carotid artery. In this cohort, only one-quarter (4 of
16) of stroke events were felt to be of carotid etiology and
therefore could have been prevented by CEA or CAS. This
is consistent with published reports demonstrating that
carotid stenosis causes w25% to 30% of ischemic
strokes.23 Although level 1 data support CEA for arteries
with $60% stenosis,4,10 the use of the consensus criteria
of an ICA PSV $230 cm/s correlating to $70% stenosis
would have led to a large number CEAs in patients
who could have otherwise been safely treated with
medical therapy and close surveillance.18
Clinical trial data support CEA for patients with asymp-
tomatic carotid stenosis $60%.3,4 Despite this, some
have postulated that these data are no longer relevant, un-
der
the
presupposition
that
medical
therapy
has
advanced to the point that revascularization should only
be considered for arteries with $80% stenosis, or perhaps
not at all. Evidence has arisen on both sides of this
debate.24,25 For example, Conrad et al9 documented a
rate of progression to ipsilateral neurologic symptoms of
25% in a cohort of 126 patients with asymptomatic
severe stenosis at a mean follow-up of 27 months, 14 of
whom presented as unheralded strokes. Conversely,
Abbott has conjectured that “medical therapy alone” is
now sufficient to treat asymptomatic patients with 50%
to 75% stenosis, citing a number of observational and clin-
ical trials.8,26-28 Although the widespread adoption of
statin therapy has likely affected the natural history of pa-
tients with peripheral vascular disease, the recent publica-
tion of the Asymptomatic Carotid Trial and 10-year Carotid
Revascularization
Endarterectomy
vs
Stenting
Trial
(CREST) trial data has demonstrated that excellent
results
can
be
obtained
after
revascularization.29,30
Despite the innumerable opinions that have arisen, there
is undoubtedly a subset of patients who will derive benefit
from revascularization.3,4,31,32 Therefore, clearly delineating
this group by eliciting the most appropriate duplex veloc-
ity threshold for intervention is vital.33
The decision to undertake carotid revascularization for
asymptomatic patients is frequently predicated on the
percentage of stenosis based on duplex velocity criteria.
Counterintuitively, though, the way in which the percent-
age of stenosis is determined is widely variable and
inconsistent.19,20,34-36
More
than
three
decades
ago,
Strandness et al37 first established a set of CDUS velocity
criteria for use in clinical practice. These criteria were
widely
accepted
as
an
alternative
to
the
previous
mechanism of invasive angiography. Since its inception,
CDUS velocity criteria have undergone a multitude of
permutations in an attempt to advance its use in
clinical
practice.14,19,38-40
Although
well
intentioned,
these permutations have had the undesired result of
wide variation between centers. This was clearly docu-
mented by Arous et al,19 and has led to an environment
where, based on local CDUS criteria, a patient may be

 offered revascularization at one institution or enter
surveillance at another only 10 to 20 miles apart.
In this series, we document that among a cohort of
patients with an index ICA PSV of 230 to 429 cm/s with
a high rate of antiplatelet and statin use, the actuarial
freedom from any stroke is 93% at 5 years (Fig 3).
Moreover, only 25% of these strokes would have poten-
tially been prevented by CEA or CAS, with freedom
from carotid-etiology stroke rate of 98.4% at 5 years
(Fig 4). These rates approach that of randomized trials
reporting
midterm
and
long-term
outcomes
after
intervention for asymptomatic stenosis.29,30 Although it
is undesirable that 5% (17 of 327) of patients experienced
a TIA while under surveillance, as a result of surgical or
medical
management,
no
strokes
occurred.
These
findings suggest that it is safe to use conservative CDUS
velocity criteria as a threshold for surgical intervention
in asymptomatic patients.
As may be expected, a history of contralateral CEA was
associated with a higher risk of stroke and highlights the
nature of the aggressive disease pattern in patients who
require revascularization. Congestive heart failure was
predictive of stroke, as is consistent with published
literature.41,42 In addition, progression by duplex and
higher baseline velocities were associated with a higher
risk of TIA and revascularization. One might speculate
that more frequent surveillance, more aggressive medi-
cal management, or even CEA/CAS might be useful in
this patient cohort, but we cannot answer that question
with the current analysis. However, those with asymp-
tomatic carotid stenosis do have an increased risk of all
types of stroke compared with the general population,
and because of this, intensive medical therapy should
be instituted for all patients.1,33

 Carotid-etiology stroke events represented the minority
of events that occurred under surveillance, but these
events are of course central to the treatment of carotid
stenosis. This level of detail is infrequently reported in
clinical trials and is not possible with large data sets
because of the inability to determine stroke laterality
and differentiate between ischemic and hemorrhagic
events.43,44 Despite this, it is these specific events that
are potentially preventable by surgical revascularization
and, therefore, the end point against which CEA and
CAS interventional thresholds and outcomes should be
adjudicated. Such a level of detail was first described
by the NASCET investigators when they reported the nat-
ural history of patients who were randomized that were
additionally monitored for contralateral asymptomatic
stenosis.45 They elucidated that nearly half of ischemic
stroke events that occurred during follow-up in patients
with asymptomatic stenosis were lacunar or cardioem-
bolic. They concluded that this would have important
implications for patients being considered for revascular-
ization because surgical intervention would likely not
reduce the risk of these types of stroke. Indeed, advance-
ments in medical therapy have shown a decrease in
overall stroke events over time; however, the distribution
of events noted by the NASCET investigators is similar to
our findings described here.
It is also important to note that 49% of patients
included in this analysis would have met the CDUS
criteria for inclusion in CREST-2. The baseline characteris-
tics of this subgroup were not statistically different from
those of the overall cohort, save for a higher rate of bilat-
eral disease. A subgroup analysis of patients meeting
CREST-2 criteria on all of the study outcomes showed
survival curves that were nearly identical to those of the
entire cohort, and the difference between them was
not statistically significant. Historically it may be thought
that clinical equipoise exists for patients with intermedi-
ate carotid stenosis, but these findings indicate that
medical therapy and surveillance is appropriate for
many patients with intermediate stenosis by conserva-
tive duplex criteria.
Moreover, with this low rate of carotid-etiology stroke
(and therefore preventable by CEA or CAS), trials using
“any stroke” as an end point may be underpowered to
detect a benefit for patients undergoing revasculariza-
tion, biasing results toward noninferiority of medical
therapy.46 Furthermore, if only patients with intermedi-
ate carotid stenosis by conservative criteria are random-
ized to trials, we may soon face level 1 data that no
longer
support
revascularization
for
asymptomatic
carotid stenosis. It is therefore imperative that patients
with all grades of asymptomatic disease, including
severe stenosis, be randomized, because this subgroup
of patients may be most likely to derive a stroke-
prevention benefit.
In summary, the natural history of intermediate asymp-
tomatic carotid stenosis is not benign. However, the
incidence of stroke events that occur under surveillance
in
patients
on
medical
therapy
with
this
level
of
disease appears to approach that of contemporary revas-
cularization trials. In this cohort, carotid-etiology stroke
accounted for only 25% (4 of 16) of events observed in
patients
under
surveillance
using
our
institutional
criteria, with freedom from carotid-etiology stroke of
98.4% at 5 years by Kaplan-Meier analysis, a detail unavai-
lable in large data sets. Every effort should therefore be
made to extract data on long-term surveillance directly
from medical records because this provides the most
granular analysis of clinical events outside of randomized
trials.
Most of those who progress to symptomatic status
should be offered revascularization, as supported by
randomized trial results.5 Asymptomatic progression
under surveillance is not unusual, and CEA might be
considered for these patients. Baseline velocity criteria
and duplex progression are predictive of neurologic
events, but the rate of neurologic events is rare, and

 even the low risk for potential complications with
surgical revascularization (ie, stroke, nerve injury)3,4,47-49
justifies the use of conservative CDUS criteria.
This study has intrinsic limitations. First, it is a single-
center retrospective study. However, because current
registries do not include patients who do not undergo
intervention or do not provide sufficient detail to parse
out the intricacies of each individual stroke, our single-
center analysis provides a level of granularity that is infre-
quently available. The included patient population had
high compliance with medical therapy and may not
extrapolate to all practices.
In addition, it is not possible to know with 100%
certainty whether a stroke is preventable by CEA or
CAS. However, independent adjudication by a board-
certified vascular surgeon and stroke neurologist allowed
for what we believe to be the highest likelihood of
correct group assignment. Because not all patients
received magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible
that
some
asymptomatic
stroke
events
were
not
detected.
Lastly, the decision to undertake revascularization was
ultimately at the discretion of the attending vascular sur-
geon, and thus, bias may affect the relatively low rate of
elective asymptomatic revascularizations.
CONCLUSIONS
Patients
with
intermediate
asymptomatic
carotid
artery stenosis by conservative CDUS criteria (ICA PSV
230-429 cm/s) do well with medical therapy when
carefully monitored and intervened upon for progres-
sion to symptoms or critical stenosis. Although progres-
sion of stenosis under surveillance is not uncommon,
the unheralded stroke rate is low and comparable to
contemporary trials of asymptomatic revascularization.
These data suggest that using the consensus criteria
correlating a PSV of $230 cm/s with a stenosis of 70%
would lead to a large number of CEA or CAS in patients
who could have otherwise been safely treated with
medical therapy and close surveillance. It is therefore
imperative
that
patients
with
severe
stenosis
be
randomized to contemporary trials of asymptomatic
stenosis,
because
if
only
those
with
intermediate
stenosis are included, current trials may be biased to
demonstrate no benefit of revascularization. Current
recommendations
and
institutional
CDUS
velocity
criteria should be re-evaluated, and future studies
should give careful attention to determining which
stroke
events
could
have
been
prevented
by
revascularization.

DISCUSSION
Dr Anil Hingorani (Brooklyn, NY). You operated on
some asymptomatic patients in your follow-up who pro-
gressed to between 70% and 79% stenosis. Were those
measurements made based upon color flow imaging,
other criteria that you used? Because you didn’t really
elucidate where you got those criteria from.
Dr Jesse A. Columbo. Patients were offered an inter-
vention at the discretion of the operating surgeon based
on local duplex velocity criteria and a discussion of the
risks and benefits at the time of the clinic visit.
Dr Christos Liapis (Athens, Greece). Congratulations.
Besides the peak systolic velocity (PSV), did you use any-
thing like plaque characteristics to decide what you were
going to do with these patients?
Dr Columbo. Plaque characteristics and echogenicity
do factor in during the shared decision-making process
with the patient. However, as far as percent stenosis
and offering an intervention, it is the duplex velocity
criteria that usually receive the most weight.
Dr Ali AbuRahma (Charleston, WV). This is a very timely,
important presentation, and you have done a good job in
presenting the data. However, I would like to suggest
that you emphasize, especially for the audience, that
when the consensus panel met in 2003, they reviewed
over 100 articles and compared various criteria and clas-
sifications of stenosis in order to arrive at these numbers.
However, they also advised clinicians to validate these
data in their own labs, which you have done. Therefore,
a PSV of 230 cm/s must be associated with significant
plaquing to go along with the >70% stenosis. If you
don’t see >70% plaquing, you must incorporate other
parameters; which you have already touched on, ie, an
end-diastolic velocity >100 cm/s and a systolic ratio
above 4. Therefore, I am wondering if you should recalcu-
late your data, based not only on a PSV of >230 but also
an EDV of 100 cm/s and a systolic ratio of 4 to see if the
natural history would be the same. I appreciate your
comment.
Dr Columbo. You make a very important point: 49% of
our cohort met the criteria that you mention; specifically,
a PSV of greater than 230 as well as either an end-dia-
stolic greater than 100 or an internal-to-common carotid
ratio of 4. We repeated the analysis on this subgroup of
patients; the Kaplan-Meier curves were nearly identical.
Dr Mahmoud Malas (Baltimore, Md). Congratulations
on
this
important
and
timely
study.
You
clearly
showed, similar to our study, that patients with moder-
ate stenosis do not need surgery. In our prior study,
only 25% of these patients progressed to severe steno-
sis,
and
only
3%
became
symptomatic.
I
strongly
recommend for everyone who participated in Carotid
Revascularization
and
Medical
Management
for
Asymptomatic
Carotid
Stenosis
Trial
(CREST)
2,
to
randomize all patients, including the patient with se-
vere stenosis. If we only include patients with moderate
stenosis, we are going to show that medical manage-
ment is just as good as carotid endarterectomy in
asymptomatic patients. It is our responsibility to also
include patients with velocity of 600 and 700 cm/s
because this is where we are going to see benefit for
intervention over medical management. I wonder if
you can comment on that.
Dr Columbo. I think you make an extremely important
point.
CREST
2
is
a
very
important
trial.
As
you
mentioned, if we only enroll patients who are just at
the threshold of meeting criteria for inclusion, then the
final study analysis may show no benefit to intervention,
as these patients likely will fare well with medical ther-
apy. It is very important for us to remember that patients
where a benefit is more likely to be found are in those at
the upper end of the velocity spectrum. Therefore, it is
vital that these individuals be randomized as well.

 APPENDIX (online only).
Vascular laboratory details. All carotid duplex ultra-
sound studies were performed at a single vascular labo-
ratory
accredited
by
the
Intersocietal
Accreditation
Commission. General Electric Logiq E9 (GE Healthcare,
Wauwatosa, Wisc) ultrasound scanners with a linear array
9L range-gated Doppler probe (MHz range 2.5-8) were
used. Lower-frequency probes, such as a GE C1-5 with a
range of 2-5 MHz, were used when patient body habitus
resulted in poor visualization.
Patients were positioned supine with the head rotated
slightly to the contralateral side with mild hyperextension
of the neck. The carotid artery was examined as far
proximally
and
distally
as
sonographically
possible.
Common carotid artery velocities were recorded from a
nondiseased segment w2 cm proximal to the bifurcation.
If there was a significant stenosis at this point, a more
proximal nondiseased segment was chosen to calculate
internal-to-common carotid artery ratios. Internal carotid
artery velocities were taken from the proximal internal
carotid artery. All carotid duplex ultrasound velocities
were measured at 60� relative to the flow channel, when
this could not be performed, angles #60� with the lowest
amount of deviation were used.
