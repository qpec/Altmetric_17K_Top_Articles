ABSTRACT
Purpose: This report describes the safety, immuno-
genicity, and pharmacokinetic results of obiltoxaxi-
mab treatment in healthy subjects from 5 clinical trials.
Methods: Healthy men and women were enrolled
in randomized, double-blind studies of obiltoxaximab
versus placebo (studies 1–3), an open-label, parallel-
group study of obiltoxaximab alone versus obiltox-
aximab and ciprofloxacin (study 4), or a randomized,
double-blind, placebo-controlled study involving ad-
ministration of a second dose of obiltoxaximab 13 or
119 days after an initial dose (study 5). Obiltoxax-
imab was administered intravenously in all studies.
The safety profile was characterized by physical
examinations, including focused examinations of the
skin and infusion sites; study drug infusion discontin-
uations; and assessment of adverse events, vital signs,
electrocardiographic findings, laboratory parameters,
and immunogenicity. Studies 3 to 5 were the primary
safety profile studies. Pharmacokinetic parameters
were calculated using noncompartmental methods.
Findings: Results of 2 multiple dose studies (studies
1 and 2) revealed that obiltoxaximab exposure in-
creased proportionally. Pharmacokinetic results were
consistent across studies. After administration of
16 mg/kg of obiltoxaximab, serum concentrations
decreased in a biexponential or multiexponential
fashion with a terminal half-life of 17 to 23 days.
Mean volume of distribution was approximately
6.3 to 7.5 L, suggesting obiltoxaximab distribution
outside the vascular compartment and potentially into
tissues. Mean systemic clearance was approximately
0.27 L/d, suggesting that hepatic metabolism and/or
renal excretion are not critical to obiltoxaximab
elimination. Obiltoxaximab was generally well toler-
ated. Hypersensitivity reactions were the most com-
mon adverse reactions in the safety profile clinical
trials, occurring in 34 of 320 subjects (10.6%) receiv-
ing obiltoxaximab and 4 of 70 subjects (5.7%)
receiving placebo. The most common adverse events
were headache, pruritus, upper respiratory tract in-
fection, cough, infusion site swelling, bruising and/or
pain, nasal congestion, urticaria, and extremity pain.
Of the 320 subjects in the primary safety profile
studies who received Z1 dose of 16 mg/kg of
obiltoxaximab,
8
(2.5%)
tested
positive
for
a
exposure-emergent antiobiltoxaximab response; how-
ever, quantitative titers were low (1:20–1:320).
Implications: On the basis of consistent results of
5 clinical trials in healthy volunteers, the pharmaco-
kinetic properties of obiltoxaximab after a 16-mg/kg
IV infusion can be considered adequately character-
ized, a criteria of the Animal Rule. Obiltoxaximab
appears to be generally well tolerated. ClinicalTrials.

INTRODUCTION
There is continued great interest in the development of
effective therapeutics for the treatment of anthrax, the
highly lethal infection caused by Bacillus anthracis, a
gram-positive,
aerobic,
encapsulated,
endospore-
forming, rod-shaped bacterial pathogen.1,2 Anthrax
can manifest as cutaneous, gastrointestinal, inhala-
tional, or injection-related infections, depending on
the route of exposure, with the inhalational form
having a fatality rate of approximately 50% even
under optimal treatment conditions.3–6 The incidence
of naturally acquired anthrax is rare; however, B
anthracis spores are readily bioweaponized.7,8 In
2011, a bioterrorism attack in which B anthracis
spores were intentionally delivered through the US
Postal Service resulted in 22 cases of anthrax disease,
11 of which were inhalational. Of these individuals, 5
died despite appropriate care, including aggressive
treatment with multiple antimicrobials.9
Anthrax infection begins with a prodromal phase
that has a median duration of 3.9 days (range, 3.5–4.4
days) and consists of localized infection with flulike
symptoms.4 After this prodromal phase, there is an
abrupt transition to the fulminant phase, which is
characterized by fever, dyspnea, diaphoresis, and
shock, with a rapid progression (ie, approximately
3 days) to death in the absence of immediate antibiotic
therapy. According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention,10 therapy for suspected anthrax with
the possibility of anthrax meningitis should include at
least 3 antimicrobial drugs active against B anthracis.
At least 1 agent should have bactericidal activity, with
intravenous ciprofloxacin being the preferred agent
(levofloxacin
and
moxifloxacin
are
considered
equivalent). In addition, at least 1 should be a
protein synthesis inhibitor, and all 3 agents should
have good central nervous system penetration.
The pathogenic virulence of B anthracis is in large
part due to the anthrax toxins—edema toxin and lethal
toxin—that are critical for the later and more terminal
stages of the disease. The virulence of B anthracis is
expressed only when a protective antigen (PA) is
combined with a lethal factor (LF), forming the lethal
toxin, or an edema factor (EF), forming the edema
toxin.11 PA is a 83 kDa protein that binds to specific
membrane receptors (TEM8 and CMG2) found on
most mammalian cells. Once bound to receptors, PA is
proteolytically cleaved to form active PA (PA63), which,
after binding to the cell surface, facilitates binding and
subsequent transfer of LF and EF into the host cell
cytoplasm.12 This leads to impairment of intracellular
signaling pathways, interference with phagocytosis by
macrophages, and disruption of water homeostasis
with resulting edema.13–15 Because of the central role
that PA plays in toxin assembly and intoxication of
target cells, PA neutralization and blocking of the
binding to its receptor have been found in animal
models to be an effective therapeutic strategy for
preventing the establishment and progression of inhala-
tional anthrax disease.16
Obiltoxaximab, a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that
binds and neutralizes PA, has been developed under
the US Food and Drug Administration’s Animal Rule
regulation (21 CFR §601.90). This rule is specifically
intended for agents for which the conduct of definitive
human efficacy studies is not ethical or feasible, as in
the case of agents for the treatment of anthrax. For a
new therapeutic to be approved under this rule, the
pharmacokinetic (PK) properties and safety profile of
the product must be well described in humans. Dose
selection is based on human PK properties and safety
profile in conjunction with animal efficacy and phar-
macodynamic studies.17,18 We report the PK results of
obiltoxaximab in humans after intravenous adminis-
tration to healthy subjects from 5 clinical trials: 4
single-dose studies (1 dose-escalation study using
nominal dosing [study 1], 1 dose-escalation study
using weight-based doses [study 2], 1 definitive safety
profile and PK study [study 3], 1 drug-drug interaction
study with ciprofloxacin [study 4]), and 1 repeat-dose
study (study 5) and safety profile results from 3
primary safety profile studies (studies 3–5).
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The study protocols, including all amendments, were
approved by the investigational review boards at each
study site, and the studies were conducted in accord-
ance
with
Good
Clinical
Practice.
The
ethical
principles have their origins in the Declaration of
Helsinki; the Belmont Report; 21 CFR §50, 56,
and 312; 45 CFR §46; the International Conference
on Harmonisation (E6); and any applicable regulatory

 requirements. Written informed consent was obtained
from
each
subject
before
any
evaluations
were
performed.
Study Participants
Details of enrollment criteria are presented in
Supplemental Table I. In general, healthy adult men
and nonpregnant women of any race were included in
these studies. There were no restrictions for body
weight or body mass index except for study 1, in
which body mass index was limited (418.5–o35
kg/m2), and study 2 (418.5–o30 kg/m2). In all
studies, exclusion criteria included clinically significant
comorbidities; contraindications to the use of mAbs,
such as history of allergic or hypersensitivity reactions
to other therapeutic antibodies or immunoglobulins;
clinically
significant
abnormalities
apparent
on
electrocardiogram; and blood donation or loss of Z1
pints of blood within 30 days or plasma donation
within 7 days of day 1 of the study. Subjects with
systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurements
outside reference ranges were also excluded. Smoking
status as an entry criterion varied by study. Prior
immunization with any approved or investigational
anthrax
vaccine
or
prior
treatment
with
any
approved
or
investigational
anthrax
treat-
ment (eg, raxibacumab, anthrax immune globulin)
was also prohibited. Military personnel deployed in
1990 or later were excluded, unless the subject
provided documentation that indicated that he/she
had not received any approved or investigational
anthrax vaccine previously (studies 3–5).
Studies 1 and 2 excluded regular use of medications
(except acetaminophen in study 2) for chronic con-
ditions (subjects who discontinued 41 week before
study initiation were allowed in study 1) and receipt of
an investigational agent within 3 months of screening
in study 1 or 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever was
longer) of screening in study 2. Use of systemic
steroids, immunosuppressive agents, anticoagulants,
or antiarrhythmics within 1 year before day 1 (a single
o14-day course of systemic steroid therapy was
permitted if it concluded 46 months before day 1)
and use of histamine1-receptor antagonists (ie, anti-
histamines) within 5 days before day 1 were exclusion
criteria in studies 3 to 5. Because study 4 required
administration of ciprofloxacin, exclusion criteria
specific to ciprofloxacin were included in the protocol
(Supplemental Table I).
Study Design
Studies 1, 2, 3, and 5 were randomized, double-
blind, and placebo-controlled, and study 4 was an
open-label, parallel-group study (Supplemental Table I).
The primary objective of these trials was to evaluate the
safety and tolerability of obiltoxaximab in healthy
volunteers. Secondary objectives were to evaluate PK
properties and immunogenicity. Study 1 was a dose-
escalation study in which 45 subjects were randomized
to receive 120, 240, or 360 mg of obiltoxaximab or
placebo in a ratio of 4:1 (n ¼ 15 in each group,
including at least 4 females), with higher doses ad-
ministered only after the previous dose was deemed
tolerable by the Safety Monitoring Committee after
review of clinical and laboratory data collected during
42 days. Study 2 was a dose-escalation study in which
108 subjects were randomly assigned to receive either
single doses of obiltoxaximab, 4, 8, or 16 mg/kg, or
placebo (ratio 5:1) in 3 sequential cohorts of 30
subjects. Enrollment was controlled so that at least 4
female subjects were enrolled in each cohort. The 16-
mg/kg cohort was not initiated until the 8-mg/kg dose
was deemed tolerable
by the Safety Monitoring
Committee.
Study 3 was a primary safety profile study in which
280 subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive
a single 16-mg/kg dose of obiltoxaximab or placebo.
Because obiltoxaximab may be administered with
ciprofloxacin in the clinical setting, study 4 was a
drug-interaction study in which 40 subjects were
randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 16 mg/kg of
obiltoxaximab alone or 16 mg/kg of obiltoxaximab,
followed immediately by 400 mg of IV ciprofloxacin
on day 1, then 750 mg twice daily of oral ciproflox-
acin, from days 2 to 8 and a single dose on day 9.
Study 5 was a repeat-dose study in which 70 subjects
were randomized to receive a 16-mg/kg dose of
obiltoxaximab on days 1 and 14, with a placebo
infusion on day 120 (n ¼ 35) or a 16-mg/kg dose of
obiltoxaximab on days 1 and 120 with a placebo
infusion on day 14 (n ¼ 35).
Obiltoxaximab and matching placebo were sup-
plied as a liquid formulation and stored before use in
sterile, single-use vials at 21C to 81C. Studies 1 and 2
were conducted with investigational material, and
studies 3 to 5 were conducted using the commercial
formulation. Study drug was prepared by an un-
blinded pharmacist at each clinical site by diluting the
appropriate volume of stock solution from the supplied

 single-use vial(s) into 0.9% sterile sodium chloride for
infusion based on the assigned dose level and the
subject’s weight (studies 2–5). All doses were adminis-
tered by intravenous infusion for 60 (study 1) or 90
minutes (studies 2–5) on study day 1 in studies 1 to 4
and on study day 1 and study day 14 or 120 in study 5.
During the conduct of studies 3 and 5, the protocol
was amended to include the administration of 50 mg
of oral diphenhydramine 30 minutes before the
administration of obiltoxaximab. Study 4 included
diphenhydramine pretreatment as part of the original
protocol. Studies 1 and 2 were completed before the
requirement for pretreatment with diphenhydramine
was introduced.
Sample Collection
Blood samples (3.5 mL) for obiltoxaximab PK
analysis were collected before dosing (0 hours) and
after
the
start
of
infusion
at
specified
times
(Supplemental Table I). Serum was separated and
kept frozen (–801C to –701C) until analyzed.
Blood samples (3.5 mL) for screening of antither-
apeutic antibodies (ATAs) were collected before dos-
ing on day 1 and at specified times during each of
the 5 studies. Serum was separated and kept frozen
(–801C to –701C) until analyzed.
Determination of Obiltoxaximab Concentrations
and ATA Detection
Serum samples for obiltoxaximab analysis and
ATAs were batched and shipped to EMD Millipore
Corporation (now Eurofins; St. Charles, Missouri) for
analysis. Obiltoxaximab concentrations were deter-
mined using a validated ELISA method in which PA83
is used as the capture reagent, with an assay range of
100 to 5000 ng/mL. Selectivity was found in individ-
ual lots of normal human serum in the presence of
spiked obiltoxaximab at 300 and 3000 ng/mL. Selec-
tivity was also tested in individual lots of normal
human serum spiked with an irrelevant antibody; all
results were below the assay lower limit of quantita-
tion of 100 ng/mL. The accuracy (relative error)
ranged from –2.4% to 4.7%, and the %CV ranged
from 4.4% to 15.2%. There was no interference from
ciprofloxacin or diphenhydramine, individually or in
combination.
ATA detection followed a tiered approach (screen-
ing and confirmatory assays) using a validated electro-
chemiluminescence method. Briefly, samples were first
subjected to a minimum required dilution of 1:10.
Samples were then acidified to release ATAs from
obiltoxaximab complexes, followed by neutralization
and capture of the ATAs with biotinylated obiltoxax-
imab. The biotinylated obiltoxaximab-ATA complex
was subsequently bound to streptavidin-coated plates
to immobilize the complex. The samples were washed
and reacidified to free captured ATAs. The solution
that contained the acidified ATAs was added to a
MesoScale Discovery plate, neutralized, incubated,
and washed, and the detection antibody, ruthenium-
labeled obiltoxaximab, was then added. A signal was
generated from ruthenylated-obiltoxaximab antibody
on the MesoScale Discovery plate integrated with
carbon electrodes after the addition of a MesoScale
Discovery read buffer. This qualitative method used
rabbit antiobiltoxaximab polyclonal antisera–positive
controls spiked at low (1:10,000 dilution) and high
(1:1000 dilution) concentrations in pooled human
serum to monitor the assay. The negative control
was nonspiked pooled human sera. Samples screened
positive in this assay were confirmed positive in an
additional confirmatory assay. Free nonlabeled obil-
toxaximab was added in the detection step to compare
with
ruthenium-labeled obiltoxaximab
for bound
ATAs
to
confirm
that
the
ATAs
were
truly
obiltoxaximab-binding
antibodies.
Serum
samples
were assayed for ATAs at an initial dilution of 1:10.
Samples that had detectable ATAs in the confirmatory
assay at an initial dilution of 1:10 were serially diluted
1:2 and assayed until a negative result was attained.
The titer of the most dilute sample that yielded a
measurable result was recorded as the titer for that
time point. Subjects were considered to have had an
immune reaction if the titer of Z1 postobiltoxaximab
administration sample(s) was Z4 times higher than
baseline in subjects who had detectable ATAs at
baseline or Z1:20 in subjects who had undetectable
ATAs (titer o1:10) at baseline.
PK Analysis
PK parameters were derived using noncompart-
mental methods with Microsoft Office Excel 2007
using the PK Solutions 2.0 template (Summit Research
Services,
Montrose,
Colorado)
(study
1)
and
WinNonlin Professional version 5.2 (study 2) and
version 6.2.1 (studies 3–5). Cmax and Tmax were
observed values. The terminal-phase rate constant
(k) was determined by linear regression of the terminal
Clinical Therapeutics

 phase of the log concentration-time profile, and t1/2
was calculated as ln(2)/k. The AUC was calculated
using the
trapezoidal
method to AUC0–last,
and
AUC0–1 was calculated as AUC0–last þ Clast/k, where
Clast is the last quantifiable concentration. CL was
calculated as dose divided by AUC0–1, and Vd was
calculated as dose divided by AUC0–1 � k, and
volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was
calculated as CL � mean residence time.
Only subjects from the PK populations in each
study were included in the analyses. Any subject who
received a partial obiltoxaximab dose or for whom the
dosing record was missing was excluded from the PK
population.
Safety Profile and Tolerability Assessments
Safety
profile
and
tolerability
were
assessed
throughout the studies. Safety profile assessments
included vital signs, clinical laboratory tests (including
hematologic testing, serum chemical analysis, urinal-
ysis, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, thyrotropin,
thyroid antibodies, and creatinine clearance), electro-
cardiographs,
physical
examinations,
skin
assess-
ments, infusion site assessments, and adverse events
(AEs). The safety profile was assessed for 71 days after
dosing in studies 1 to 4 and during 191 days in study 5.
The primary human safety profile studies (studies 3–5)
were conducted with the commercial formulation and
included 320 subjects who received Z1 IV doses of
16-mg/kg of obiltoxaximab.
Statistical Analysis
For
qualitative
variables,
the
population
size
(N for sample size and n for available data) and the
percentage (of available data) for each class of the
variable were presented. Quantitative variables were
summarized
using
descriptive
statistics,
including
n, mean, SD, %CV, median, minimum, and maximum
values.
In studies 1 and 2, dose proportionality of the PK
parameters, AUC0–1, AUC0–last, and Cmax over the
administered dose range was investigated using the
following power model: log (parameter) ¼ a þ b �
log (dose), where a was the intercept and b was the
slope. Dose proportionality was assessed based on
whether the 90% CI constructed for the estimate of
b was contained within the interval (0.80–1.25).
The hypothesis of dose proportionality was rejected
if the 90% CI constructed on the estimate of b was not
contained in this interval. The power model parameters
were estimated using least-squares regression. A mini-
mum of 3 values per dose had to be available for a
given parameter to estimate dose proportionality with
the power model. Data analysis was performed using
SAS software, version 9.1 or higher (SAS Institute,
Cary, North Carolina), or Excel 2013 (Microsoft
Corp, Redmond, Washington).
RESULTS
Subject Characteristics and Disposition
In study 1 (N ¼ 45), all subjects received the
planned doses of study drug, completed the study,
and were included in the PK population. In study 2,
103 of 108 randomized subjects received all planned
doses of study drug and completed all study proce-
dures. Of the 90 subjects who received obiltoxaximab,
89 were included in the PK analysis; one subject’s
infusion (16-mg/kg group) was stopped prematurely
because of a urticarial rash. In study 3 (N ¼ 280), 4
subjects in the obiltoxaximab group were lost to
follow-up, and 1 subject each in the obiltoxaximab
and placebo group withdrew consent. Of the 210
subjects who received obiltoxaximab, 202 had at least
1 valid PK measurement and were included in the PK
population. Subjects were excluded from the PK
population for reasons of missing dosing record
(1 subject), infusion discontinued because of hyper-
sensitivity reactions (6 subjects), or mechanical issues
with the infusion pump (1 subject). In study 4 (N ¼
40), of the 40 subjects who received the study drug, 38
were included in the PK population. The PK popula-
tion comprised all 20 subjects who received obiltox-
aximab
alone
and
18
subjects
who
received
obiltoxaximab and ciprofloxacin. Two subjects in
the obiltoxaximab and ciprofloxacin group had the
infusion of obiltoxaximab discontinued because of
hypersensitivity reactions and did not receive cipro-
floxacin. One subject in the obiltoxaximab and cipro-
floxacin group withdrew prematurely on day 1 for
personal reasons after having received the intravenous
obiltoxaximab and ciprofloxacin doses and did not
complete all the study assessments but was included in
the PK population. In study 5 (N ¼ 70), all subjects
received the first dose of obiltoxaximab on day 1, but
34 and 31 subjects received a second dose after 13
days or Z119 days, respectively. Two subjects did not
receive the second infusion of obiltoxaximab because
of a hypersensitivity reaction during the first infusion.

 The primary human safety studies were conducted
with the commercial formulation at the efficacious
dose identified in animals17 and included 320 healthy
volunteers who received Z1 16-mg/kg IV doses of
obiltoxaximab (studies 3, 4, and 5) and 70 subjects
who received an intravenous infusion of placebo
(study 3). The single-dose safety population consisted
of 300 healthy adults who were exposed to a single
dose of 16 mg/kg of IV obiltoxaximab and included
all subjects in the obiltoxaximab arm of study 3
(n ¼ 210), 20 subjects in the obiltoxaximab-only
arm of study 4, and 70 subjects in the first admin-
istration period of study 5.
Baseline characteristics were similar between the
obiltoxaximab and placebo groups (Table I). Subjects
in the single-dose safety population were 18 to 79
years of age, 54% were male, 70% white, 27% black
or African American, 1% American Indian/Alaska
Native, 1% Asian, and 11 % Hispanic.
Diphenhydramine pretreatment was received by 194
of 280 subjects (69%) in study 3, all subjects (100%) in
study 4, and in 62 of 70 subjects (89%) in study 5.

 PK Parameters
A summary of mean PK results is presented in Table
II. Considering the results of all 5 studies, serum
concentrations
decreased
in
a
biexponential
or
multiexponential fashion (Figure 1A and 1B) after
intravenous administration of obiltoxaximab, with t1/2
values of 17 to 23 days. The overall mean Vd and Vss
values for obiltoxaximab in humans across studies
were approximately
7.5 and
6.3 L, respectively,
which exceed plasma volume, but are substantially
lower than extracellular fluid volume.19 This finding
suggests that obiltoxaximab distributes outside the
vascular compartment but not extensively. This is
generally comparable to other mAbs, which have
been observed to distribute beyond the vascular
space, with potential uptake into tissues.20 Mean
systemic clearance of obiltoxaximab after intravenous
administration was approximately 0.27 L/d, which is
r0.03% of hepatic or renal plasma flow (1170 and
1000 L/d, respectively), and o0.2% of the glomerular
filtration
rate
(180
L/d)
in
a
70-kg
human,19
suggesting that, like other mAbs, hepatic metabolism
and/or renal excretion is not critical to the elimination
of obiltoxaximab.20
PK results in studies 1 and 2 revealed that obiltox-
aximab exposure increased proportionally with dose.
The similarities in mean t1/2, CL, and Vd across groups

 relationship between exposure and dose (after log
transformation) were contained within the interval
(0.80–1.25), indicating that these parameters increased
in a dose-proportional manner from 120 to 360 mg in
study 1 (based on doses in milligrams per kilogram)
and from 4 to 16 mg/kg in study 2. The 90% CI for
the slope for Cmax (0.97–1.28) in study 1 did not
strictly meet the criteria for dose proportionality but
only marginally exceeded the upper limit of the target
interval, suggesting that this parameter increased in a
generally dose-proportional manner as well. Dose-
proportional increases in Cmax and AUC0–1 values
were also observed when mean exposure parameters
from all single-dose groups across the 5 studies were
combined (Figure 2A and 2B).
In the repeat-dose study (study 5), given the limited
sampling during days 1 to 14, the lack of attainment
of steady state after the second dose, and the slow
rates of distribution and elimination relative to the
dosing interval, there were insufficient serum concen-
tration data in the group that received study drug on
days 1 and 14 to adequately characterize the PK
profile of obiltoxaximab separately after each of the 2
dose administrations. Therefore, the PK profile in this
group was treated as a 32-mg/kg dose split into two
16-mg/kg administrations (day 1 and day 14), and PK
parameters were calculated based on continuous
concentration-time data from day 1 before dosing
through
day
191

dosing.

on day 1 was essentially indistinguishable from that

concentrations in the predose serum samples of each
subject on day 120. However, these concentrations

 were so slight relative to exposures later in the profile
(0.09%–5.5% of the subsequent end-of-infusion con-
centration) that their effect on PK parameters deter-
mined for the day 120 dose was considered negligible.
The obiltoxaximab AUC0–1 after two 16-mg/kg doses
in relatively short succession (days 1 and 14) was
approximately twice that after a single 16-mg/kg dose
on day 1 or day 120. In addition, t1/2, CL, and Vd
values in the day 1/day 120 dose group were similar to
those in the day 1/day 14 dose group. This finding
suggests that overall obiltoxaximab exposure after
two
16-mg/kg
doses
2
weeks
apart
increased
proportionally relative to a single 16-mg/kg dose
and that the disposition of obiltoxaximab after two
16-mg/kg doses in relatively short succession did not
differ from that after a single 16-mg/kg dose. Coad-
ministration of 16 mg/kg of IV obiltoxaximab with IV
or oral ciprofloxacin in human subjects (study 4) did
not alter the PK profile of either ciprofloxacin or
obiltoxaximab.
Safety Profile and Tolerability
An obiltoxaximab dose of 16 mg/kg was generally
well tolerated when administered intravenously as a
90-minute infusion to healthy volunteers (studies 3–5).
The percentage of subjects with AEs in study 3 was
similar in the obiltoxaximab and placebo groups
(49.1% and 38.6%, respectively). The most frequently
reported AEs in the obiltoxaximab arm of the primary
safety study (study 3) were headache (10%), pruritus
(4.8%), rash (4.3%), upper respiratory tract infection
(3.8%), vessel puncture site bruise (3.3%), and cough
(2.9%) (Table III). All AEs were mild to moderate in
severity, except for severe pruritus and urticaria in
1 subject who was not premedicated with diphen-
hydramine. Most subjects in the obiltoxaximab arm
(96.7%) and all subjects in the placebo arm (100%)
completed study drug infusion. Six subjects (2.9%) in
the obiltoxaximab arm and no subjects in the placebo
arm permanently discontinued the infusion of the
study drug because of hypersensitivity reactions, 2 of
which met the criteria for anaphylaxis.21 In the single-
dose pooled safety population (n ¼ 300), the most
frequently reported adverse reactions that occurred in
Z1.5% of healthy subjects receiving a single 16-mg/kg
dose of obiltoxaximab and more frequently than in
those receiving placebo were headache (8%), pruritus
(4%), upper respiratory tract infection (5%), cough
(3%), vessel puncture site bruise (3%), infusion site
swelling (3%), nasal congestion (2%), infusion site
pain (2%), urticaria (2%), and extremity pain (2%)
(Table IV). Clinical laboratory test results, vital signs,
and electrocardiography results were unremarkable
and stable over time. Tolerability at the infusion site
was acceptable.
Subjects in the single-dose safety population who
were pretreated with diphenhydramine before the
infusion of study drug had a lower overall incidence
of adverse reactions than those without diphenhydr-
amine pretreatment (42% vs 58%, respectively) and a
lower incidence of headache (5% vs 16%), cough (1%

somnolence was only reported in subjects who were
pretreated with diphenhydramine.
There was no change in the safety profile, no
additional adverse reactions identified, and no change
in frequency of adverse reactions when a second
16-mg/kg IV dose of obiltoxaximab was administered
13 days or Z119 days after the first 16-mg/kg dose.
Hypersensitivity reactions were the most common
adverse reactions in the safety profile trials, occurring
in 34 of 320 healthy subjects (10.6%) receiving
obiltoxaximab and 4 of 70 (5.7%) subjects receiving
placebo. Obiltoxaximab infusion was discontinued in
8 subjects (2.5%), and 2 subjects in the repeat-dose
study (study 5) did not receive a second dose of
obiltoxaximab, 1 because of urticaria and 1 because
of anaphylaxis (Table V). The subjects were 28 to
70 years of age, 6 were male and 4 were female, and
9 were white and 1 was American Indian or Alaska

 Native. Six subjects were premedicated with diphen-
hydramine before the infusion of obiltoxaximab, and
4 were not because they were enrolled before the
protocol amendment requiring premedication. The
adverse
reactions
reported
in
these
10
subjects
included urticaria, rash, cough, pruritus, postural
dizziness, throat irritation, dysphonia, dyspnea, chest
discomfort, and cyanosis. The symptoms in 3 of the
10 subjects [3 of 320 (0.9%)] met the criteria for
anaphylaxis (subjects 6, 7, and 9) (Table V).21
Manifestations of anaphylaxis were rash/urticaria (n
¼ 2), cough (n ¼ 1), dyspnea (n ¼ 2), cyanosis (n ¼
1), postural dizziness (n ¼ 1), and chest discomfort (n
¼ 1). The vital signs of these 3 subjects were stable
throughout the event, and hypotension and hypoxia
were not noted. There was also no evidence of
bronchospasm or upper airway angioedema. All but
1 of the 10 subjects with hypersensitivity reactions
required additional therapy, including intravenous
diphenhydramine (n ¼ 9), famotidine (n ¼ 3),
methylprednisolone (n ¼ 2), normal saline (n ¼ 1),
intramuscular epinephrine (n ¼ 1), and oxygen (n ¼
1). The remaining subjects with hypersensitivity had
predominantly skin-related symptoms, such as pruri-
tus and rash, and 6 subjects reported cough.
The development of antiobiltoxaximab antibodies
was evaluated in all subjects receiving one or two
16-mg/kg doses of the commercial formulation of
obiltoxaximab in studies 3, 4, and 5. Eight of 320
subjects (2.5%) who received at least 1 dose of
intravenous
obiltoxaximab
tested
positive
for
a
administration-emergent ATA response. Quantitative
titers were low, however, ranging from 1:20 to 1:320.
Assays for neutralizing antibodies were not performed
because of residual obiltoxaximab concentrations in
postobiltoxaximab administration sera, which inter-
fered with the assay, but there was no evidence of
altered PK or toxicity profile in subjects with ATA
development. There was also no evidence of increased
immunogenicity after a second exposure to obiltox-
aximab compared with a single exposure.
DISCUSSION
The PK results from 5 studies in more than 450
healthy volunteers were consistent. Obiltoxaximab
had dose-proportional increases in exposure, and
serum concentrations decreased in a biexponential
fashion after intravenous administration, with t1/2
values that approached 3 weeks. The volume of
distribution was approximately 6.3 to 7.5 L, a volume
that may suggest tissue penetration, as has been noted
with
other
mAbs.15
Mean
clearance
was
only
0.27
L/d,
suggesting
that,
like
other
mAbs,
obiltoxaximab is not extensively metabolized by the
liver or eliminated by the kidneys.20 In addition, study
5 found that obiltoxaximab exposure after two
16-mg/kg
doses
approximately
2
weeks
apart
increased proportionally relative to a single 16-mg/
kg dose and that the disposition of obiltoxaximab
after two 16-mg/kg doses in relatively short succession
did not differ from that after a single 16-mg/kg dose.
The disposition of obiltoxaximab when a second dose
was administered on day 120 was virtually identical to
that after the first dose on day 1. As the human
pharmacokinetic studies progressed, it was determined
that the 16-mg/kg dose produced systemic exposures
similar to or greater than at the maximally efficacious
dose in cynomolgus macaques and New Zealand
White rabbits.17
The 16-mg/kg dose of obiltoxaximab was safe and
generally well tolerated in this healthy volunteer popula-
tion. The most common adverse reactions reported were
headache, pruritus, upper respiratory tract infection,
cough, vessel puncture site bruise, infusion site swelling,
nasal congestion, infusion site pain, urticaria, and pain in
extremity. Most of the events were mild to moderate in
severity, and the local tolerability was acceptable. Three
percent of subjects discontinued obiltoxaximab infusion
or did not receive a second infusion because of hyper-
sensitivity reactions. Hypersensitivity is a common AE
associated with drugs, especially protein therapeutics.
Hypersensitivity reactions manifest as a spectrum of
clinical signs and symptoms and may occur during or
immediately after drug exposure because of release of
histamine and other vasoactive mediators. Most of the
hypersensitivity reactions associated with obiltoxaximab,
primarily manifesting as pruritus, rash, and urticaria,
were mild to moderate in intensity, and these individuals
were usually treated only with antihistamines. Only 1
subject participating in the primary safety profile studies
was reported as having experienced severe hypersensitiv-
ity reactions: severe pruritus and urticaria in a subject
who had not been premedicated with diphenhydramine.
No hypersensitivity reactions were considered by study
investigators to represent serious AEs.

reaction

 symptoms.22 Clinicians are typically well aware of
anaphylaxis, although there is no universal agreement on
its definition. Specific diagnostic criteria have been
proposed21 but are open to interpretation and not
necessarily widely implemented clinically. During the
obiltoxaximab clinical trials, anaphylaxis was reported
by 1 investigator in a subject who required treatment with
epinephrine. This subject experienced a diffuse, pruritic
urticarial rash, shortness of breath, and coughing. Two
other subjects experienced acute hypersensitivity reactions
associated with cardiorespiratory symptoms but were not
reported as having anaphylaxis by the investigators.
Manifestations included rash, dyspnea, and cyanosis in
one and urticaria, postural dizziness, chest discomfort,
jaw pain, and dysarthria in the other. Neither required
epinephrine for management of symptoms. None of these
3 subjects was reported as having hypotension, bron-
chospasm, or oropharyngeal angioedema. However, all 3
are included in the safety results of this report and in
product labeling as having experienced anaphylaxis. In
addition to these 3 individuals, 7 subjects stopped taking
the study drug because of mild to moderate hyper-
sensitivity reactions. None demonstrated evidence of
cardiorespiratory
compromise
or
angioedema.
It
is
probable that the threshold for discontinuation in these
healthy volunteers was lower than that for patients
receiving
monoclonal
antibodies
for
active
medical
conditions because there was no potential benefit to
continuing obiltoxaximab administration.
The approval of obiltoxaximab in the United States
for the treatment of inhalational anthrax due to B
anthracis in combination with appropriate antibacte-
rial drugs in adult and pediatric patients23 provides an
additional treatment for this deadly disease. The
recommended
dosage
of
obiltoxaximab
in
adult
patients is a single IV dose of 16 mg/kg during 90
minutes.
Obiltoxaximab
is
also
approved
for
prophylaxis
when
alternative
therapies
are
not
available or not appropriate but should only be
used for prophylaxis when its benefit for prevention
of
inhalational
anthrax
outweighs
the
risk
of
hypersensitivity
and anaphylaxis.
Because
human
studies evaluating the effectiveness of obiltoxaximab
for infections due to B anthracis are not ethical and
field trials have not been feasible, obiltoxaximab was
developed under the Animal Rule, under which a drug
can be approved based on animal efficacy studies.24
The PK profile of obiltoxaximab has been well
described in these 5 healthy volunteer studies, which
was necessary for the selection of an effective dose in
humans. The PK studies in animals have generally
produced similar results, specifically, dose-proportional
increases in exposure and serum concentrations that
decreased in a biexponential fashion after intravenous
administration. However, the t1/2 in animals was
shorter than that in humans.18
The PK profile of obiltoxaximab has been exam-
ined and considered to have been adequately charac-
terized after a 16-mg/kg IV infusion, meeting 1 of the
criteria of the Animal Rule. In addition, obiltoxax-
imab is generally well tolerated. Obiltotoxaximab was
associated with acute hypersensitivity reactions, in-
cluding anaphylaxis, but the overall safety experience
was consistent with other monoclonal antibodies.
B anthracis has been identified as a top priority
biowarfare target because of the potential for mass
casualties in the event of spore dispersion as part of a
bioterrorist attack. These data, combined with pre-
viously reported efficacy data from animal model
experiments,17
support
the
addition
of
obiltox-
aximab to the therapeutic armamentarium in the
treatment of inhalational anthrax.

Randomly permuted blocks of size 5
were used to achieve an active-to-

parameters (Cmax and AUC) with 80%
power based on the variability
observed in previous clinical studies.
Additionally, the sample size was
sufficient to examine dose
proportionality. In a two-sided tests
analysis for equivalence of sample log-
normal geometric means with bounds
of 0.8 and 1.25 for the mean ratio
and a significance level of 0.05,
assuming variability observed in
previous studies, a sample size of 30

80% to conclude dose proportionality
Subjects were randomly assigned to
groups in 3 sequential cohorts. Within
each cohort, subjects were randomly
assigned to receive obiltoxaximab or
placebo in a ratio of 5:1, using a
block size of 6. A “meet in the middle”
rule was used to assign randomization
numbers for males and females. An
enrolled female volunteer was
assigned to the lowest available
randomization number and a male
volunteer to the highest available
randomization number, until all 8
volunteers for a given cohort were
included.

Based on the randomization ratio,
approximately 210 subjects in this

subjects exposed to a single 16 mg/kg
IV dose of obiltoxaximab in the
clinical development program was at
least 350 subjects.
Subjects were randomized in a block
