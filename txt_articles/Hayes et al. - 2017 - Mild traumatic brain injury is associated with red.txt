Moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury is one of the strongest environmental risk factors for the development of neurodegen-
erative diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, although it is unclear whether mild traumatic brain injury, or concussion,
also confers risk. This study examined mild traumatic brain injury and genetic risk as predictors of reduced cortical thickness in
brain regions previously associated with early Alzheimer’s disease, and their relationship with episodic memory. Participants were
160 Iraq and Afghanistan War veterans between the ages of 19 and 58, many of whom carried mild traumatic brain injury and
post-traumatic stress disorder diagnoses. Whole-genome polygenic risk scores for the development of Alzheimer’s disease were
calculated using summary statistics from the largest Alzheimer’s disease genome-wide association study to date. Results showed
that mild traumatic brain injury moderated the relationship between genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and cortical thickness,
such that individuals with mild traumatic brain injury and high genetic risk showed reduced cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s
disease-vulnerable regions. Among males with mild traumatic brain injury, high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease was associated
with cortical thinning as a function of time since injury. A moderated mediation analysis showed that mild traumatic brain injury
and high genetic risk indirectly influenced episodic memory performance through cortical thickness, suggesting that cortical
thinning in Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable brain regions is a mechanism for reduced memory performance. Finally, analyses that
examined the apolipoprotein E4 allele, post-traumatic stress disorder, and genetic risk for schizophrenia and depression confirmed
the specificity of the Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk finding. These results provide evidence that mild traumatic brain injury is
associated with greater neurodegeneration and reduced memory performance in individuals at genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease,
with the caveat that the order of causal effects cannot be inferred from cross-sectional studies. These results underscore the
importance of documenting head injuries even within the mild range as they may interact with genetic risk to produce negative
long-term health consequences such as neurodegenerative disease.

Introduction
Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results from an external force
applied to the head that causes alterations in consciousness
such as dizziness, amnesia, or loss of consciousness. TBI of
varying levels of severity has been associated with neural
and cognitive changes that can persist chronically, years
after the initial injury (Kraus et al., 2007; Hayes et al.,
2015; Miller et al., 2016). Of concern for the millions of
Americans injured each year, TBI is one of the strongest
environmental risk factors for the development of neurode-
generative diseases such as late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
and chronic traumatic encephalopathy. The link between
TBI and Alzheimer’s disease has been studied for several
decades, with two meta-analyses confirming enhanced risk
for Alzheimer’s disease following TBI, particularly among
males (Mortimer et al., 1991; Fleminger et al., 2003).
However,
the
mechanisms
that
instantiate
risk
for
Alzheimer’s disease after TBI are unknown. Researchers
have noted a number of common features associated with
both TBI and Alzheimer’s disease including inflammatory
and apoptotic (i.e. programmed cell death) processes, along
with the accumulation of proteins that contribute to cell
death. For instance, Uryu et al. (2002, 2007) demonstrated
in both mouse models and in human subjects that TBI is
associated with amyloid-b, �-synuclein, and tau, three
pathological markers of Alzheimer’s disease.
However, the aforementioned neurodegenerative markers
have primarily been observed in moderate-to-severe TBI
(Johnson et al., 2012) and some have suggested that risk
for
dementia
following
TBI
increases
with
severity
(Plassman et al., 2000). Although there is some preliminary
evidence that mild TBI is also associated with increased risk
of dementia and its biomarkers in older adults (Gardner
et al., 2014), the evidence has been inconsistent and has
led some to suggest that mild TBI alone, without the pres-
ence of additional risk factors, may be insufficient to de-
velop dementia (Bigler, 2013). As the majority of TBIs
sustained in civilian and military contexts are within the
mild range (Cassidy et al., 2004; Terrio et al., 2009), the
relationship between mild TBI and dementia risk is an im-
portant issue requiring further study.
In
addition
to
environmental
risks
for
Alzheimer’s
disease (e.g. TBI), there is abundant evidence for genetic
contributions to the disease. In light of the strong heritabil-
ity of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (60–80%; Gatz et al.,
2006), an important question is whether TBI moderates the
genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Studies to date have
focused on TBI in individuals carrying the apolipoprotein
(APOE) E4 allele, with inconsistent results. Some studies
have found poorer outcomes in E4 carriers following TBI
(Jordan et al., 1997; Friedman et al., 1999), whereas others
have not, or have found that E4 carriers were less likely to
have dementia following head injury (Guo et al., 2000;
Jellinger et al., 2001; Chamelian et al., 2004).
Interest has grown in the calculation of polygenic risk
scores to index genetic risk since the publication of a sem-
inal Psychiatric Genomics Consortium study that used a
polygenic score to explore the genetic architecture of
schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (Purcell et al., 2009).
A polygenic risk score uses the results from a genome-
wide association study (GWAS) of a particular trait to
compute a genetic propensity score for that trait in a new
sample or cohort with available genome-wide genotype
data. Recent work suggests that polygenic risk scores for
Alzheimer’s disease are better predictors of Alzheimer’s dis-
ease than are single candidate variants such as APOE. It
has been shown that genome-wide single nucleotide poly-
morphism (SNP) analysis explained 33% of the phenotypic
variance in Alzheimer’s disease in comparison to 6% ex-
plained with APOE, and the 8% of variance explained by
the combination of 11 other Alzheimer’s disease risk SNPs
(Ridge et al., 2013). Recently, Sabuncu et al. (2012)
demonstrated that healthy subjects with higher polygenic
risk scores derived from an Alzheimer’s disease GWAS
showed reduced cortical thickness in areas affected most
by Alzheimer’s disease (Sabuncu et al., 2011). These results
suggest that polygenic risk scores may serve as predictors of
prodromal Alzheimer’s disease-related brain pathology.
In the present study, we hypothesized that individuals
with
both
mild
TBI
and
high
polygenic
risk
for
Alzheimer’s disease would be the most likely to show
reduced
cortical
thickness
in
previously
identified
Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable regions (Sabuncu et al.,
2011). Further, we investigated the hypothesis that reduced
cortical thickness in these same regions reflected a neuro-
degenerative process by examining associations between
cortical thickness and years passed since the mild TBI.

 Finally, we hypothesized that reduced cortical thickness
would be associated with lower delayed memory perform-
ance, a neuropsychological domain particularly sensitive in
detecting Alzheimer’s disease. In additional analyses, we
examined specificity of the main findings by considering
whether repetitive mild TBI, the APOE E4 allele, and poly-
genic risk for mental illnesses were also significant pre-
dictors
of
cortical
thickness.
We
examined
these
hypotheses in a sample of Iraq and Afghanistan War vet-
erans exposed to a range of mild TBI events during their
lifetimes, including direct forceful contact of the head and
blast-related mild TBI experienced in combat. Among those
exposed to TBI, the sample was limited to individuals with
mild severity in order to examine potential links between
this most common type of TBI and markers of neurodegen-
erative disease. We sought to shed light on whether there
are markers of prodromal neurodegeneration (i.e. reduced
cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable regions)
in a younger cohort of veterans who were exposed to TBI
(i.e. those who served in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars).
Although it is known that TBI in older military personnel is
associated with a 60% increase in the risk of developing
neurodegenerative disease (Barnes et al., 2014), detection of
neurodegenerative markers in a younger cohort would have
important implications for development of interventions to
inhibit TBI-induced neurodegeneration as well as long-term
care for these veterans. Finally, we studied the influence of
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during the lifespan
on
Alzheimer’s
disease-related
cortical
thinning,
a
common comorbidity in the veteran cohort, which shares
behavioural
symptoms
with
neurodegenerative
disease
(Omalu et al., 2011).
Materials and methods
Participants
The final sample included 160 white non-Hispanic veterans of
Operations Enduring Freedom, Iraqi Freedom, and New Dawn
who
were
consecutively
enrolled
into
the
Translational
Research Center for TBI and Stress Disorders (TRACTS) at
the Jamaica Plain Division of the Veterans Affairs Boston
Healthcare System. Participants were recruited from through-
out the Boston Metropolitan area through outreach military
community events (e.g. Yellow Ribbon events). We used all
available TRACTS data that met our selection criteria. We
first identified 258 white, non-Hispanic subjects to avoid popu-
lation stratification effects. Of these, 55 subjects were missing
genotype data, an additional 29 were missing neuroimaging
data, eight were missing clinical assessment data, and six in-
dividuals were excluded because they had moderate and/or
severe TBI. Demographics as a function of mild TBI status
in the entire sample are shown in Table 1 and characteristics
of the mild TBI sample, including nature of injury, and dur-
ation of alterations in mental status, post-traumatic amnesia,
and loss of consciousness are shown in Table 2. All subjects
experienced alterations in mental status, 76% experienced
post-traumatic amnesia, and 57% of the sample experienced
loss of consciousness. The groups did not differ significantly in
age, sex, or Wechsler Test of Adult Reading-estimated IQ
(WTAR; Wechsler, 2001), but they did differ in the presence
of lifetime PTSD and sleep disturbance. Additional details re-
garding inclusion/exclusion criteria for the sample are included
in
the
Supplementary
material.
Study
procedures
were
approved by the VA Boston Institutional Review Board and
all participants provided written informed consent consistent
with the Declaration of Helsinki.
MRI acquisition and processing
Participants were scanned on a Siemens 3 T TIM Trio located
at the Jamaica Plain Division of VA Boston Healthcare System.
Two 3D magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo (MP-
RAGE) scans were acquired in the sagittal plane and averaged
to
create
a
single
high
contrast-to-noise
image
(voxel
size = 1 mm3, T1 = 1000 ms, repetition time = 2530 ms, echo
time = 3.32 ms). Automated cortical reconstruction and volu-
metric segmentation were performed with the FreeSurfer image
analysis suite (version 5.0), which is available for download
online (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/). See Supplementary
material for details regarding imaging analysis with FreeSurfer.
Cortical thickness values were extracted from seven regions
including the entorhinal cortex, temporopolar cortex, lateral
temporal cortex, inferior parietal cortex, inferior parietal
sulcus, posterior cingulate cortex, and inferior frontal cortex
(Fig. 1). These regions of interest were selected because collect-
ively, they have shown the greatest bilateral cortical thinning
in early Alzheimer’s disease in comparison to healthy older
adults (Sabuncu et al., 2011). Region of interest masks were
downloaded from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies
(OASIS) dataset, which is publically available with FreeSurfer.
Regions of interest were registered to each individual subject’s
cortical representation via surface-based registration and cor-
tical thickness values were extracted for each subject. Values
were averaged across left and right hemispheres and then aver-
aged to create a single cortical thickness score across the seven
regions (Sabuncu et al., 2011). An additional seven FreeSurfer
regions of interest were selected to serve as control regions for
the putative Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable regions of interest.
Selection of these regions was semi-random with the constraint
that, similar to the Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable regions, re-
gions within the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes would be
represented. These included the middle temporal gyrus, lateral
occipital gyrus, paracentral gyrus, postcentral gyrus, lingual
gyrus, frontal pole, and the insula.
Clinical and cognitive assessment
TBI history was assessed using the Boston Assessment of TBI-
Lifetime (BAT-L; Fortier et al., 2014), which was administered
by a doctoral-level psychologist with extensive training in
neuropsychology. The BAT-L is a semi-structured interview
based on the Department of Defense diagnostic criteria of
TBI and captures self-reported history of TBI experienced
pre-, during, and post-military deployment. Mild TBI was
defined as loss of consciousness lasting 530 min, and/or an
altered mental status lasting 524 h, and/or a period of post-
traumatic amnesia lasting 524 h. Additional details regarding
TBI assessment are included in the Supplementary material.

 Lifetime PTSD was assessed with the Clinician-Administered
PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et al., 1995), a structured diagnostic
interview that is the gold standard for assessment of the dis-
order. The CAPS assessment was performed by doctoral level
psychologists with advanced training in psychological assess-
ment. On this interview, each DSM-IV PTSD criterion is as-
sessed
with
two
CAPS
sub-items,
one
that
reflects
the
frequency of the symptom on a 0–4 scale and one that reflects
the intensity of the symptom on a 0–4 scale. As with TBI,
PTSD diagnosis was decided via consensus meeting of doc-
toral-level psychologists. Sleep disturbance was measured by
the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al.,
1989) and defined as a global score 45 on the PSQI.
Premorbid IQ was estimated using the WTAR. This measure
contains 50 irregularly spelled words of increasing difficulty to
pronounce. The ability to perform this test remains unchanged
following disease and injury. Episodic memory performance
was assessed using the long-delay free recall score of the
California Verbal Learning Test-Second Edition (CVLT-II;
Delis et al., 2000). Long delay list learning tasks have been
found to be the most sensitive to early Alzheimer’s disease
(Welsh et al., 1992; Weintraub et al., 2012). One subject
was missing this measure, and therefore analyses with the
CVLT-II had a total n = 159.
DNA genotyping and polygenic risk
score computation
APOE genotyping was conducted by the Pharmacogenomics
Analysis
Laboratory
at
the
Central
Arkansas
Veterans
Healthcare System, Little Rock, Arkansas. A detailed descrip-
tion of the genotyping protocol and generation of genome-
wide genotypes is presented in the Supplementary material.
A polygenic risk score is a weighted average of genome-wide
genotype data. The weights are the beta values estimated from
the GWAS (or log odds ratios) if the GWAS was of a dichot-
omous trait. The polygenic risk score is the sum of these
weights times the additively coded genotypes in the target
population (0, 1, 2 coding). Polygenic scores are usually com-
puted based on all SNPs from the GWAS under a specified
P-value threshold such as P 5 0.05 or P 5 0.5. As there is as
of yet no a priori way to identify which cut-off yields the most
predictive scores, scores are usually computed over multiple
P-value thresholds, often with a multiple-testing correction to
judge their significance, and then the most predictive is used in
further calculations or validated in an additional sample. In
addition, the SNP sets are often ‘trimmed’ for linkage disequi-
librium (i.e. non-independence between variants) to avoid the
inclusion of redundant information in score calculation. In the
present study, the polygenic risk scores for Alzheimer’s disease
were
computed
based
on

load.php. Poorly imputed SNPs (Impute2 quality 5 0.50) and
rare SNPs (minor allele frequency 5 0.01) were excluded from
risk score calculation. Prior to imputation, the SNP panel was
trimmed for linkage disequilibrium using PLINK’s ‘clumping’
procedure (r2 threshold of 0.2 in a 500 kb window based on
linkage disequilibrium patterns in the 1000 Genomes EUR
sample). Polygenic scores were computed assuming six differ-
ent
P-value
thresholds:
P 5 0.05,
P 5 0.10,
P 5 0.20,
P 5 0.30, P 5 0.40, and P 5 0.50. As a control, schizophrenia
and depression polygenic risk scores were also computed from
the Psychiatric GWAS Consortium results using the same
methodology (Ripke et al., 2013a, b) (https://www.med.unc.
edu/pgc/downloads).
Statistical approach
Regression models examining mild TBI, PTSD,
genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and cortical
thickness
Data were analysed using a series of linear regression models.
Main effects of mild TBI and Alzheimer’s disease polygenic
risk score models were fit by which the average cortical thick-
ness across the seven Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable regions
was regressed onto the polygenic risk score at each of the
six polygenic risk score P-value thresholds. Covariates for all
models and follow-up tests included age, sex, WTAR, PSQI,
and lifetime PTSD. Similar models were used to assess the mild
TBI by polygenic risk score interaction, again run for each of
the six P-value thresholds. Corrected significance for main ef-
fects and interactions was determined using Monte-Carlo null
simulation with 10 000 replicates in which the genetic data
were randomly permuted between subjects. This analysis
imposed strict multiple-testing control while taking into ac-
count the correlations between the six polygenic risk score
P-value threshold variables.
We selected the polygenic score threshold value that showed
the strongest interaction effect with mild TBI on cortical thick-
ness. All subsequent analyses used this threshold value. To
parse the relative effects of the polygenic score, mild TBI and
covariates, a series of post hoc models were fit using a three-
step hierarchical regression analysis. In the first model, nuis-
ance
covariates
(age,
sex,
WTAR,
PSQI,
lifetime
PTSD
diagnosis) were entered. In the second model, the main effects
of polygenic risk and mild TBI diagnosis were entered. Finally,
the polygenic risk by mild TBI interaction term was entered
into the third model. The results reported below refer to the
output of Model 3 as we were most interested in the mild TBI
by polygenic risk interaction. As there were only 11 female
veterans in the entire dataset (seven with mild TBI), linear
models were repeated including males only. Although educa-
tion may also be entered as a covariate due to its association
with onset of dementia in some studies, we selected premorbid
IQ (i.e. WTAR) as a covariate due to evidence that when both
premorbid IQ and education are entered into the model, pre-
morbid IQ has a greater association with dementia than edu-
cation (Pavlik et al., 2006; Doody et al., 2010). We further
note that in this sample, education is not a significant predictor
of cortical thickness, nor does its inclusion as a covariate
change the results.
As there is evidence for higher risk of neurodegeneration
following repetitive mild TBI (see Blennow et al., 2012), we
also examined whether number of mild TBIs sustained over the
lifespan moderated the association between polygenic risk for
Alzheimer’s disease and cortical thickness (this model was lim-
ited to participants with TBI). To examine whether PTSD
influenced the relationship between genetic risk and cortical
thickness, the regression model included main effects for life-
time PTSD, polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and their
interaction.
Cortical thickness as a function of time since injury
To examine the hypothesis that genetic risk is associated with
accelerated cross-sectional cortical thinning, we calculated the
amount of time (in years) that had elapsed since the last re-
ported TBI (age at study � age at most recent mild TBI). We
added the interaction of this time variable and polygenic risk
to our linear regression model (this model was also limited to
participants with TBI).
Examining the effect of APOE and other Alzheimer’s
disease-related single nucleotide polymorphisms
Linear models were run to examine the main effect of APOE
(E4 carriers, n = 37; non-E4 carriers, n = 123) and the mild
TBI by APOE interaction on cortical thickness. Additional
models assessed the top five SNPs that reached genome-wide
significance for genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease from

Effects in individual Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable
brain regions and specificity of hypotheses
To examine to extent to which the interaction between mild
TBI and genetic risk was associated with any particular region
of interest or hemisphere among the seven Alzheimer’s disease-
vulnerable regions, we ran a three-step hierarchical regression
model (covariates in step 1; main effects of mild TBI and poly-
genic risk in step 2; interaction term in step 3) for each of 14
brain regions (each of the seven Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable
regions, left and right separately). To correct for multiple com-
parisons across the 14 hierarchical regression analyses, signifi-
cance for main effects and interactions was determined using
Monte-Carlo null simulation with 10 000 replicates.
To determine specificity of the Alzheimer’s disease-vulner-
able cortical thickness findings, we examined mild TBI and
genetic associations with seven control regions of interest
(see ‘MRI acquisition and processing’ section for details).
Further, to determine the specificity of the polygenic risk for
Alzheimer’s disease scores, we examined the interaction be-
tween mild TBI and a depression polygenic risk score, and
mild TBI and a schizophrenia polygenic risk scores to predict
cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable regions.
Moderated mediation analysis
To examine the relationships among mild TBI, polygenic risk,
and memory performance, a regression-based path analysis
was performed estimating and probing interactions and condi-
tional indirect effects in a moderated mediation model using
the PROCESS tool (Hayes, 2013) as implemented in SPSS
v. 21. In this model, we examined evidence that the strength
of the relationship between genetic risk and memory perform-
ance through cortical thickness is conditional on the value of a
moderator (lifetime mild TBI). A detailed description of the
moderated
mediation
model

polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, with the strongest
association occurring for the polygenic score computed
using the P = 0.2 threshold (see Supplementary Table 1
for results at each polygenic risk P-value threshold). As
predicted, there was a significant mild TBI by Alzheimer’s
disease polygenic risk (maximum effect with the P = 0.2
threshold) interaction whereby individuals with both mild
TBI and high polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease had
reduced cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable
regions (P = 0.019, corrected P = 0.048; Table 3 and Fig. 2)
and this explained significant incremental variance in cor-
tical thickness. These results remained significant after
removing the 11 female participants from the dataset.
There was no evidence that the number of mild TBIs (i.e.
repetitive mild TBI) moderated the association between
polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and cortical thickness
(P 4 0.75).
To further explore the pattern of results, we examined
the relationship of mild TBI and low/high polygenic risk
score groups (based on median split), with the caveat that
this approach may be inherently less powerful than model-
ling using the continuous scale. Correcting for all covari-
ates, between group comparisons revealed that subjects at
high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and mild TBI had
the lowest average cortical thickness values. Supplementary
Fig. 1 shows a bar plot of the mean cortical thickness
values of each group. The difference was significant in com-
parison to the high Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk with no
TBI group (P = 0.004) and the low Alzheimer’s disease gen-
etic risk with mild TBI group (P = 0.015). The pairwise test
was not significant in comparison to the low Alzheimer’s
disease genetic risk no-TBI group (P = 0.138). The low gen-
etic risk/no mild TBI group, low genetic risk/mild TBI
group, and the high genetic risk/no mild TBI group were
not significantly different from each other (all pairwise
P’s 4 0.2). The high Alzheimer’s disease genetic risk and
mild TBI group had lower cortical thickness values in com-
parison to the other three combined (P = 0.004).
To examine whether PTSD moderated the relationship
between genetic risk and cortical thinning, we entered the
PTSD by Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk score inter-
action to the regression model. The main effect of PTSD,
and the interaction with Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk
were not significant (P’s 4 0.3, see Supplementary Table 2).
Further, the interaction between mild TBI and PTSD, with-
out including Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk in the
equation, was not significant (P 4 0.5). These results did
not change after removing females from the analysis.
Taken together, these results suggest that PTSD was not
associated with cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-
sensitive regions, either alone or in conjunction with mild
TBI or polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
Greater cortical thinning with time
since mild TBI and high genetic risk
To examine evidence for a neurodegenerative process
among those at high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease,
we computed the amount of time (years) that had elapsed
since the last reported TBI and added the interaction of this
time variable and polygenic risk to the model (limited to
participants with TBI). The interaction effect between time
of last mild TBI and polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease
was marginally significant when including both males and
the seven females with mild TBI (n = 105, P = 0.07), but

 P = 0.042, Fig. 3). This effect was age-independent (as age
was accounted for in the model), and was not replicated
when entering age at injury in place of time since injury
(P 4 0.7). Calculation of predicted values from the male-
only regression model revealed that cortical thinning in in-
dividuals with high genetic risk (e.g. risk score = 95th
percentile) was greater by 0.14 mm 10 years post-injury,
0.22 mm 20 years post-injury, and 0.31 mm 30 years
post-injury
than
individuals
with
low
genetic
risk
(e.g. 10th percentile). With the caveat that these results
are cross-sectional, they may suggest that cortical thinning
increases over time, signalling a neurodegenerative process
among those with high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
Mild TBI does not moderate APOE or
other Alzheimer’s disease candidate
single nucleotide polymorphisms
There was no main effect of APOE on cortical thickness,
nor was there a mild TBI by APOE interaction. Further,
when including polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease
scores in the model, the polygenic score was still associated
with cortical thickness after adjusting for APOE status.
These analyses did not change when females were removed.
Linear models showed that only one SNP, rs4147929 in
ABCA7 showed a significant mild TBI � SNP effect on cor-
tical thickness (P = 0.043). However, this effect did not
survive multiple comparisons correction (Supplementary
Table 3).
Association between mild TBI, poly-
genic risk for Alzheimer’s disease,
and individual Alzheimer’s disease-
vulnerable brain regions
We next explored whether mild TBI moderated the rela-
tionship between polygenic risk and any particular region
of interest and hemisphere among the Alzheimer’s disease-
vulnerable regions examined. The strongest association for
the interaction between mild TBI and polygenic risk was
observed in the right posterior cingulate cortex (corrected
for multiple comparisons, P = 0.019; see Table 4). The
interaction was also associated with the left temporopolar
cortex (P = 0.021), but this effect did not survive multiple
comparisons correction (Supplementary Table 4). These re-
sults did not change when females were removed.

 Specificity of Alzheimer’s disease-
vulnerable cortical regions and poly-
genic risk scores
We next examined mild TBI and genetic associations with
seven control regions of interest. The mild TBI by polygenic
risk score interaction did not significantly predict average
cortical thickness in these control regions, suggesting speci-
ficity to the previously determined Alzheimer’s disease-vul-
nerable brain regions (Supplementary Table 5). Further, to
determine
specificity
of
the
polygenic
risk
score
for
Alzheimer’s disease, we examined whether mild TBI mod-
erated the relationship between polygenic risk for depres-
sion and schizophrenia and cortical thickness. There were
no significant interactions between mild TBI and any P-
value threshold for either the depression or schizophrenia
polygenic risk scores in predicting cortical thickness.
Mild TBI and genetic risk for
Alzheimer’s disease influence delayed
memory indirectly through cortical
thickness
Finally, we examined whether the mild TBI by polygenic
risk for Alzheimer’s disease effect on cortical thickness had
implications for memory performance. Delayed memory
tests are considered to be the most sensitive in detecting
Alzheimer’s disease in the early stages, thus we examined
the long-delay free recall scores from the CVLT-II. First, we
tested the hypothesis that polygenic effects confer risk for
episodic memory loss though disturbances in cortical thick-
ness, with mild TBI moderating the polygenic effect. The
interactive effects of Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk by
mild TBI interaction on cortical thickness and of cortical
thickness to delayed memory were both significant adjust-
ing for age, sex, PSQI, PTSD, and premorbid IQ. Further, a
bias-corrected bootstrap confidence interval for the indirect
effect of the highest order interaction (i.e. testing the hy-
pothesis that the mild TBI � polygenic risk interaction
influences memory performance indirectly through cortical
thickness) did not encompass zero [ab = �0.026, 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) �0.08 to �0.002], suggesting a signifi-
cant model. As expected, the combination of mild TBI and
higher Alzheimer’s disease polygenic risk scores was asso-
ciated with reduced CVLT-II long-delay free recall scores
through loss of cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-
vulnerable brain regions (Fig. 4).
Discussion
This study examined the associations of mild TBI, poly-
genic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, and their interaction
with cortical thickness in brain regions susceptible in
Alzheimer’s disease. There were three main findings. First,
the combination of mild TBI exposure and high polygenic
risk for Alzheimer’s disease was associated with reduced
cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable brain
regions. Second, cortical thinning in Alzheimer’s disease-
vulnerable regions was accelerated post-injury (indexed by
years elapsed since the last reported mild TBI) among males
with high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease. Finally, mild
TBI and polygenic risk-related cortical thinning was asso-
ciated with reduced delayed episodic memory recall.
Findings of this study shed new light on potential mech-
anisms of reduced cortical thickness following mild TBI by
implicating genetic pathways associated with Alzheimer’s
disease including those involved in clathrin-mediated endo-
cytosis signalling, inflammation, immune response, and
cholesterol
(Jones
et
al.,
2010;
Logue
et
al.,
2014).
Clathrin-mediated endocytosis has been associated with
amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid-b
production (Wu and Yao, 2009). APP also plays a role in
mild TBI and is considered a reliable neural marker of
injury (Blumbergs et al., 1995), suggesting that the cla-
thrin-mediated
pathway
warrants
additional
study.
Further, genetic pathway analyses in animal models of
TBI have shown greater-than-chance involvement of genes
associated with inflammation and the immune response
(Crack et al., 2009) and new data in humans suggest
changes in gene expression related to markers of inflamma-
tion
and
immune
response
following
concussion
(Merchant-Borna et al., 2016). The higher prevalence of

 stroke, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and coron-
ary artery disease previously reported in patients with TBI
versus controls (Wang et al., 2012) points to the potential
involvement of gene pathways involved in cholesterol and
atherosclerosis. Future research should examine these and
other mechanisms by which TBI may lead to the onset of
reduced cortical thickness.
There is growing evidence from animal and human work
suggesting accelerated loss of structural brain integrity fol-
lowing TBI (Trotter et al., 2015). A recent study showed
premature brain atrophy in grey and white matter in indi-
viduals with TBI (Cole et al., 2015). In this study, prema-
ture brain atrophy increased with passage of time since
injury, similar to the results reported here, which are sug-
gestive of cortical thinning as a function of the time since
injury. In addition, both the data reported in Cole et al.
(2015) and our data revealed that smaller brain structure
estimates were associated with worse cognitive perform-
ance. Of note, Cole and colleagues (2015) found acceler-
ated brain atrophy only in moderate and severe TBI cases,
but not mild TBI, consistent with the notion that severity of
injury is an important factor in predicting neurodegenera-
tion. It is possible that for individuals with mild TBI, the
biomechanical force of the injury is insufficient to elicit
neurodegenerative processes unless also accompanied by
additional risk, such as a predisposing genetic risk for
Alzheimer’s disease as reported here.
The primary brain region associated with the interaction
of mild TBI and genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease was the
posterior cingulate cortex. Previous studies have found
early structural degeneration (Lehmann et al., 2010), amyl-
oid deposition (Buckner et al., 2005), and altered func-
tional energy metabolism in this region in Alzheimer’s
disease (Minoshima et al., 1994). In addition, reduced per-
fusion in the posterior cingulate has been observed in indi-
viduals with mild cognitive impairment who go on to
develop Alzheimer’s disease (Johnson et al., 1998). This
region was also identified by Sabuncu and colleagues
(2012) as the area most strongly associated with their
Alzheimer’s disease polygenic score. Importantly, a recent
study showed that white matter volume of the posterior
cingulate/isthmus reduced over time following mild TBI
(Zhou et al., 2013). Taken together, these results suggest
that the posterior cingulate may be vulnerable to both de-
generation secondary to mild TBI and genetic risk for
Alzheimer’s disease, making it particularly susceptible to
accelerated reductions in cortical thickness with the com-
bination of TBI and neurodegenerative disease risk. We
observed hemispheric asymmetry, with the greatest cortical
thinning in the right posterior cingulate cortex. Although
this finding was not hypothesized, there is evidence for the
right posterior cingulate cortex as a strong marker for dis-
tinguishing
stable
versus
progressive
brain
atrophy
(Querbes et al., 2009). Additional work is required to
understand the role of hemispheric asymmetry in the pre-
sent results.
Results of this study also showed that cortical thickness
in Alzheimer’s disease-vulnerable brain regions was asso-
ciated with reduced performance on the CVLT-II long-
delay free recall task, a sensitive measure of Alzheimer’s
disease-associated
cognitive
impairment.
The
CVLT-II
long-delay task requires the participant to recall items
from a learned list of 16 words after a 20-min delay.
Tests that measure forgetting over a delay of minutes
have
been
shown
to
differentiate
patients
with
Alzheimer’s disease in the early stages of the disease from
healthy elderly controls with 85–90% accuracy (Knopman
and Ryberg, 1989; Welsh et al., 1991). In the present
study, there was no direct effect of mild TBI on perform-
ance
of
this
task.
However,
when
genetic
risk
for
Alzheimer’s disease and cortical thinning in Alzheimer’s dis-
ease-vulnerable regions were taken into account, there was
a clear relationship between these variables and episodic
memory performance, suggesting that only those individ-
uals with mild TBI who also have early neurodegenerative
markers show early changes in cognition. The results also

 suggest that cortical thickness may be an important and
sensitive indicator of early neurodegeneration and align
with those of Sabuncu and colleagues (2012), who also
found a relationship between genetic risk for Alzheimer’s
disease and cortical thickness. By contrast, studies that have
used cognitive performance as a measure of early neurode-
generative risk without considering brain metrics have not
found positive associations between TBI, genetic risk and
neuropsychological task performance (e.g. Millar et al.,
2003; Rapoport et al., 2008).
Although APOE represents one of the strongest risk fac-
tors for Alzheimer’s disease, APOE or other single loci did
not interact with mild TBI to predict cortical thickness.
This result further underscores the power of a genome-
wide polygenic approach to studying complex phenotypes
and is consistent with other data showing that single can-
didate genes such as APOE explain significantly less of the
phenotypic variance in Alzheimer’s disease than polygenic
scores (Ridge et al., 2013). PTSD was also not associated
with cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-related re-
gions either directly or in combination with mild TBI or
polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, raising the possibility
that mild TBI has a distinct neural signature from PTSD.
Indeed, recent studies have shown that the neurobehavioral
outcomes seen in mild TBI, despite overlapping with PTSD,
may be mediated by separate neural processes (Miller et al.,
2016). One implication of these findings is that documen-
tation and assessment of mild TBI separately from PTSD is
important, despite the sometimes near impossibility of attri-
buting behavioural outcomes to one diagnosis over an-
other.
This
is
because
although
the
behavioural
manifestation of these two diagnoses may be indistinguish-
able closer to the time of the injury, the long term out-
comes
may
ultimately
be
different
when
they
are
combined with additional risk factors such as polygenic
risk for neurodegenerative disease.
Repetitive mild TBI did not moderate the relationship
between polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease and cortical
thickness. One possibility for the negative finding is that
repetitive mild TBI may moderate genetic risk for neural
disruptions in regions more consistent with chronic trau-
matic encephalopathy pathology, including the depths of
the sulci preferentially in temporal and frontal lobes
(McKee
et
al.,
2013)
rather
than
regions
related
to
Alzheimer’s disease pathology as examined here. Another
possibility is that the repetitive mild TBIs occurred far
enough apart in the present sample to allow for recovery.
Animal studies typically have multiple exposures within a
predetermined period, and thus there may be a critical time
window in following the first TBI within the second insult
must occur to observe increased severity of brain injury
over a single mild TBI. Additional studies are necessary
to
examine
whether
either
of
these
possibilities
are
supported.
This study has several limitations that should be taken
into account. First, although we observed reduced cortical
thickness in regions that were shown previously to be asso-
ciated
with Alzheimer’s
disease, we cannot determine
whether any of the individuals in this study will develop
Alzheimer’s disease or another neurodegenerative disease in
the future, or whether lower thickness was present prior to
injury. For example, we cannot rule out the possibility that

thickness, and indirectly influenced delayed episodic memory performance. Covariates (age, sex, lifetime PTSD, PSQI, WTAR estimated IQ) were
included in the model but are not shown here for display simplicity. PRS = polygenic risk for Alzheimer’s disease score; mTBI = mild traumatic

 individuals with thinner cortices in Alzheimer’s disease-
related regions were more likely to sustain mild TBI.
Thus, we are currently following the subjects in this
study longitudinally to determine the association between
cortical
thinning
and
neurodegenerative
disease.
Longitudinal data will also help definitively determine
whether cortical thinning is accelerated over time for a
given subject, which could not be determined here given
the cross-sectional nature of this study. Second, although
we used a polygenic risk score for Alzheimer’s disease, it is
yet unknown whether the risk score is also associated with
chronic
traumatic
encephalopathy
or
other
dementias.
Currently, the research on chronic traumatic encephalop-
athy is in its infancy and there are no GWASs of chronic
traumatic encephalopathy. Given that the neuropathology
of chronic traumatic encephalopathy has shared features
with Alzheimer’s disease including tau and amyloid de-
posits, at this stage it is impossible to determine whether
these subjects would likely develop Alzheimer’s disease
versus another neurodegenerative disease. However, the
finding that cortical thickness in Alzheimer’s disease-vulner-
able regions was associated with a cognitive domain most
tied to Alzheimer’s disease over other dementias (i.e.
delayed recall), and mediated the relationship between
mild TBI and polygenic risk and episodic memory provides
support for the polygenic risk as a measure of Alzheimer’s
disease risk. Self-reported mild TBI is another limitation of
the current study. We did not have access to corroborating
military medical records, which for many military person-
nel, were often lost or destroyed because of environmental
conditions in the field (Benson et al., 2013). However,
given that this is a limitation for most other studies of
this nature, semi-structured interviews are the acknowl-
edged standard for diagnosing remote mild TBI. Further,
disentangling symptoms of psychological trauma or the
sequelae of physical injury due to mild TBI in this sample
is a challenge and adds to the uncertainty of mild TBI
diagnosis. Another limitation is the selectivity of the
sample. While representative of veterans of the recent
wars, the low number of females in the study precluded
us from having enough power to detect potential gender
differences. In addition, these findings may not generalize
to ethnic groups other than Caucasian, non-Hispanic indi-
viduals or non-military samples. Additional work is neces-
sary to determine how cortical thinning rates in military
samples compare to civilian TBI and neurological samples.
Finally, we note that the findings from this study should be
considered provisional until replication from additional
samples is obtained.
In conclusion, we report here that the combination of
mild TBI exposure and high genetic risk for Alzheimer’s
disease is associated with reduced cortical thickness in
brain regions sensitive to neurodegeneration and is accom-
panied by reduced delayed memory recall performance.
These results underscore the importance of studying the
long term consequences of mild TBI in the large numbers
of Iraq and Afghanistan service members returning with
exposure to mild TBI because of the potential public
health ramifications for long-term care.
