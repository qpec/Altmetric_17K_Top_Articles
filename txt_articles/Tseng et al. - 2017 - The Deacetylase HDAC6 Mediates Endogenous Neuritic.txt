In Brief
Tau mislocalization and aggregation are
implicated in the pathogenesis of
Alzheimer’s disease. Tseng et al. report
that endogenous neuronal tau re-
localizes to distinct neuritic foci, which
are active sites of calcium deregulation,
leading to aberrant tau accumulation.
These findings provide insights into the
early-stage tau dysfunction that occurs in
vulnerable neurons.

SUMMARY
The initiating events that promote tau mislocalization
and pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are not
well defined, partly because of the lack of endoge-
nous models that recapitulate tau dysfunction. We
exposed wild-type neurons to a neuroinflammatory
trigger and examined the effect on endogenous tau.
We found that tau re-localized and accumulated
within pathological neuritic foci, or beads, comprised
of mostly hypo-phosphorylated, acetylated, and
oligomeric tau. These structures were detected in
aged wild-type mice and were enhanced in response
to neuroinflammation in vivo, highlighting a previ-
ously undescribed endogenous age-related tau pa-
thology. Strikingly, deletion or inhibition of the cyto-
plasmic shuttling factor HDAC6 suppressed neuritic
tau bead formation in neurons and mice. Using
mass spectrometry-based profiling, we identified a
single neuroinflammatory factor, the metalloprotei-
nase MMP-9, as a mediator of neuritic tau beading.
Thus, our study uncovers a link between neuroin-
flammation and neuritic tau beading as a potential
early-stage pathogenic mechanism in AD.
INTRODUCTION
Tau proteins, which comprise six distinct tau isoforms in the
brain, normally act to bind and stabilize neuronal microtubules
(MTs) (Andreadis et al., 1992; Goedert et al., 1989). The regula-
tion of tau binding to MTs is dependent on serine/threonine
phosphorylation, predominantly in the proline-rich region, and
also by lysine acetylation directly within the MT-binding repeat
region (MTBR). These two post-translational tau modifications
act in concert to decrease tau-MT binding affinity (Biernat
et al., 1993; Bramblett et al., 1993; Drechsel et al., 1992).
Although tau hyper-phosphorylation has been extensively char-
acterized in association with neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) patho-
logy in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the role for tau acetylation in
neurons is not fully understood. However, recent studies indicate
that acetylated tau alone is sufficient to promote tau aggrega-
tion, synapse degeneration, and cognitive deficits in tauopathies
(Min et al., 2015; Tracy et al., 2016).
Site-specific tau acetylation has been identified, spanning the
MTBR domain (Morris et al., 2015). Recent studies showed that
acetylation occurs within and adjacent to the MTBR, including
K174, K274, and K281, which can lead to tau-induced toxicity
(Min et al., 2015; Tracy et al., 2016). Our previous studies showed
a striking accumulation of acetylated tau at residue K280
(located in the second MTBR) in AD patients and a wide spec-
trum of other human 4-repeat (4R) tauopathies, including corti-
cobasal degeneration (CBD) and progressive supranuclear palsy
(PSP) (Cohen et al., 2011). Although tau K280 acetylation is an
excellent marker of AD progression that correlates with thiofla-
vin-positive mature NFTs, we detected limited tau acetylation
in wild-type cultured neurons or control human brain tissue, sug-
gesting that tau acetylation may selectively accumulate in
response to specific neurotoxic cues that remain to be identified
(Cohen et al., 2011; Irwin et al., 2012). Most tau toxicity studies
rely on overexpression paradigms rather than modeling endoge-
nous tau pathology. A better understanding of the initiating
events that trigger early-stage endogenous tau pathogenesis
will provide new avenues to prevent dysfunction in AD.
Some of the very earliest neuronal dysfunction in AD includes
calcium dysregulation and the development of focal neuritic
beads (also known as swellings or varicosities) within axons
and dendrites (Falzone and Stokin 2012; Hall et al., 2000; Pike
et al., 1992; Sanchez-Varo et al., 2012; Stokin et al., 2005; Take-
uchi et al., 2005). Although Ab plaques and NFTs are well-estab-
lished hallmark features of AD, focal beading is also a prominent
but poorly understood marker of neuronal damage that occurs in
a range of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD (Xiao et al.,
2011), Parkinson’s disease (PD) (Tagliaferro and Burke 2016),
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (Delisle and Carpenter
1984; Okamoto et al., 1990), traumatic brain injury (Johnson
et al., 2013), and normal brain aging (Geula et al., 2008). Neuritic
beading is also induced by neurotoxic stimuli such as glutamate
(Hosie et al., 2012; Kim et al., 2010), nitric oxide (NO) (He et al.,
2002), hypoxia (Scott et al., 2002), oxidative stress (Roediger
and Armati 2003), and membrane shearing (Kilinc et al., 2009).

 Prior studies indicate that neuritic beading correlates with ex-
citotoxicity and degenerating synapses in AD (Greenwood et al.,
2007; Takeuchi et al., 2005; Tan et al., 2007). For example,
neuritic beading is suppressed by pharmacological inhibition of
NMDA receptors (NMDARs) (e.g., MK801 or AP5) or by intracel-
lular calcium chelators (e.g., EDTA) (Kim et al., 2010; Takeuchi
et al., 2005), supporting an NMDAR-mediated process. Although
a functional role for tau in neuritic bead formation has not been
characterized, mislocalized tau has been shown to mediate
NMDAR activation through dendritic recruitment of the kinase
Fyn (Ittner et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2011). Tau-Fyn mislocal-
ization to the dendritic compartment facilitates NMDAR subunit
phosphorylation (Ittner et al., 2010; Zempel et al., 2010). Indeed,
reducing tau or Fyn levels alleviated hyper-excitability and
neurotoxicity in models of AD or traumatic brain injury (Cheng
et al., 2014; Kaufman et al., 2015; Roberson et al., 2007, 2011).
Thus, two seemingly distinct pathological phenomena, neuritic
bead formation and tau mislocalization, are implicated as trig-
gers for excitotoxicity in AD. Whether these two events are coor-
dinated to mediate neuronal dysfunction is unknown.
Here, we used Ab oligomer-challenged macrophages and
microglia to generate conditioned medium containing neuroin-
flammatory factors to assess the downstream effects on endog-
enous neuronal tau. Surprisingly, we found that tau re-localized
to neuritic bead-like foci that showed features of AD pathology.
Inhibiting or depleting the tau-associated deacetylase HDAC6
suppressed tau mislocalization and neuritic bead formation.
Overall, our study describes a mechanism that connects neuro-
inflammation to focal tau accumulation as a potential early-stage
tau pathology prior to the development of overt NFTs.
RESULTS
Ab Oligomer-Induced Neuroinflammatory Stress
Promotes Neuritic Tau-Immunoreactive Beading
We considered the possibility that neuroinflammation present
in the brains of tau-transgenic (PS19) mice and human AD
brains, but not in isolated neuronal cultures, could potentially
explain the striking tau mislocalization and acetylation patterns
observed in vivo. Thus, we examined Ab oligomer-induced neu-
roinflammation as a plausible mediator of endogenous tau
dysfunction. Synthetic Ab1–42 oligomers were generated and
confirmed by three independent methods: the appearance of
multimeric Ab species, A11 oligomer immunoreactivity, and dy-
namic light scattering (DLS) (Figure S1). Human monocyte-
derived macrophages (hMDMs) were challenged with Ab oligo-
mers, and cell morphology was monitored. We used the lowest
non-toxic Ab oligomer concentration (1 mM) capable of activating
immune cells in vitro (Dhawan et al., 2012). Ab oligomer stimula-
tion increased the appearance of podosome-bearing cells
compared with ruffled and non-specialized cells. Such a conver-
sion has been shown previously to correlate with secretion of
neurotoxic factors (Williams et al., 2015). Quantification of this
morphology transformation showed a significant increase in
podosome-containing cells after 24-hr Ab oligomer stimulation
(Figure S1). Thus, in an analogous manner to HIV virion particles
(Meeker et al., 2016), Ab oligomers were sufficient to generate
conditioned medium (hereafter referred to as Ab-CM) that was
subsequently evaluated for its pathogenic effects on cultured
neurons.
Primary cortical neurons were exposed to Ab-CM, and tau
localization was assessed using a panel of well-characterized
tau antibodies (Figure 1A; Table S1). Surprisingly, Ab-CM
derived from either hMDMs or microglia (the latter designated
as mAb-CM) induced the accumulation of tau within distinct
neuritic beads that were detected with the dephosphorylation-
specific tau-1 antibody (Figure 1A), which were not detected in
tau knockout (KO) neurons (Figure S2). We note that CM
generated by other inflammatory cues (e.g., HIV virion particles)
can also induce neuritic tau beading (Figure S3). We refer
to these structures as tau-1-immunoreactive (tau-1IR) foci
or beads. Quantification of tau-1IR beading showed a signifi-
cant, �12-fold induction in response to Ab-CM (Figure 1B).
Endogenous mouse tau detected with T49, K9JA, or tau-5
antibodies was also localized to distinct neuritic foci, although
the tau-1 antibody appears to have a slightly higher affinity
and detection sensitivity for these structures. In contrast, we
observed limited neuritic immunoreactivity with the phospho-
tau AT8 (S202/T205) antibody, which is commonly used to
mark tau pathology in AD. To confirm that the observed beading
is due to Ab-CM and not residual Ab oligomers present in the
CM, Ab oligomers (AbO, 1 mM) were added directly to neurons
(Figures 1A and 1B), which did not induce significant morpholog-
ical changes. These results suggest that secreted neuroinflam-
matory factors produced in the Ab-CM are responsible for tau
re-localization and accumulation within neuritic beads.
Neuritic Tau Beads Are Comprised of Site-Specific
Phosphorylated, Acetylated, and Oligomeric Tau
We next analyzed additional acetylated and phosphorylated tau
epitopes known to accumulate in the AD brain. Although tau
K280 acetylation is not normally detected in wild-type neurons,
tau beads were strikingly immunoreactive with acetylated (ac)-
K280 (Figure 1C), a disease-specific marker of tauopathy (Cohen
et al., 2011). Despite the fact that AT8 was negative, neuritic
beads were phosphorylated at an adjacent epitope (S199) in
the proline-rich region (Figure 1D) and also within the MTBR
(S262), a preferred MARK2 phosphorylation site (Figure 1E;
Drewes et al., 1997). Further supporting MARK2 involvement,
active MARK2 detected with a phospho-MARK antibody (resi-
due T208), was present within tau beads, albeit less abundant
compared with its phospho-tau S262 target site (Figure 1F).
Both K280 acetylation and S262 phosphorylation have been
implicated in dissociation of tau from MTs (Cohen et al., 2011;
Schwalbe et al., 2013), suggesting that tau beading coincides
with loss of normal tau-MT binding. We next examined oligo-
meric tau, an indicator of early-stage tau pathology (Lasagna-
Reeves et al., 2012), using the T22 antibody and found that it
was highly enriched within neuritic tau-1IR beads (Figure 1G;
see quantification in Figure 1H).
We further analyzed a panel of dendritic markers implicated in
aberrant tau-mediated neuronal hyper-excitability. Neuritic tau
beads co-localized with the dendritic marker MAP2, the tau ki-
nase Fyn implicated in tau recruitment to the dendritic compart-
ment, as well as NR1, a major NMDAR subunit that is subject to
phosphorylation-dependent activation and excitotoxicity (Ittner

 et al., 2010; Roberson et al., 2011; Figure S4). We also examined
the localization of other factors involved in protein quality control,
including autophagy and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)
components that regulate tau processing and triage. The deace-
tylase HDAC6, an adaptor protein that detects and shuttles mis-
folded proteins (Kawaguchi et al., 2003) and also binds and
deacetylates tau (Cohen et al., 2011; Ding et al., 2008; Perez
et al., 2009) localized to most tau-1IR beads (Figure 2A). Similarly,
the E3 ligase CHIP and the 20S proteasome, implicated in tau
processing, were detected, whereas autophagosomal markers
such as LC3 were not prominent within these structures (Fig-
ure S4). Overall, our analysis indicates that tau beads recruit a
variety of axonal and dendritic factors known to interact with
and process tau.
HDAC6 Depletion or Inhibition Suppresses Neuritic
Bead Formation
We sought to identify a mechanism by which neuritic tau beads
form in vulnerable neurons. Given the robust recruitment of
HDAC6 to tau-1IR beads, we asked whether manipulating
HDAC6 levels or activity would alter tau beading in Ab-CM-
treated neurons. We used HDAC6 KO neurons (Figure 2B) as
well as pharmacological exposure of wild-type neurons to tubas-
tatin A (TBST), a selective HDAC6 inhibitor (Figure S5). Remark-
ably, elimination of HDAC6 showed nearly a complete loss of
neuritic beads (Figure 2B) as well as reduced focal recruitment
of degradative and synaptic components to bead-like structures
(Figures 2C–2E). Overall, there was a �90% reduction in beading
in HDAC6 KO neurons (Figure 2F), supporting an HDAC6-depen-
dent process. A similarly dramatic suppression of beading was
observed with TBST treatment (Figure 2F; Figure S5).
To investigate the physiological consequences of tau beading,
we assessed the viability of neurons challenged with Ab-CM in
the presence or absence of TBST. Using independent survival
assays that monitor neuronal death or metabolic function, we
found that TBST partially alleviated only the neuronal death
phenotype, as assessed by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assay,
but did not significantly alter the reduction in metabolic activity,
assessed by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazo-
lium bromide (MTT) assays (Figure 2G), suggesting a neuropro-
tective effect that is independent of mitochondrial function. Sur-
prisingly, mild neuroprotection occurred despite the fact that tau
acetylation levels were increased in neurons exposed to TBST
(Figure S5).
Because neuronal death in AD is linked to excitotoxicity, we
asked whether tau-1IR bead formation is associated with intra-
cellular calcium increases that occur following NMDAR activa-
tion. Live calcium imaging was performed in Ab-CM-challenged
neurons in the absence or presence of TBST to suppress tau-1IR
beading (Figure 3). Excitotoxicity is associated with delayed and
sustained elevation of intracellular calcium, and we therefore
monitored both the early acute and delayed calcium changes
occurring over an �60-min period following exposure to
Ab-CM. Ab-CM induced an acute calcium rise in the neuronal
cytoplasm, followed by a gradual delayed calcium increase (Fig-
ure 3A). Notably, discrete foci of calcium accumulation were
seen in axonal and dendritic processes, which gave rise to
neuritic beads (Figure 3A, see the white arrowheads at the
10, 30, and 60 min time points). Ab-CM, mAb-CM, or even
CM generated from HIV virion-challenged hMDMs (HIV-CM)
induced comparable calcium dysregulation in neurons (Fig-
ure 3B; Figure S3). HDAC6 KO or TBST treatment dramatically
reduced calcium influx throughout the incubation period by
�4- to 5-fold, including at the endpoint of the delayed calcium
phase (Figures 3B and 3C). The calcium influx and beading
were also strongly inhibited by the NMDAR antagonist AP5,
suggesting
that
tau-1IR
beads
represent
active
sites
of
NMDAR-driven calcium influx. In contrast, inhibition of MARK2
(also localized to neuritic beads; Figure 1F) using the MARK in-
hibitor 39621 did not affect calcium influx (Figure 3C).
We next assessed the effect of Ab-CM on tau by immunoblot-
ting using a panel of tau antibodies (Figure S5). Total tau levels
were not appreciably altered in Ab-CM-challenged neurons,
consistent with tau mislocalization as a key pathological indica-
tor, as opposed to changes in overall tau levels. Tau hypo-phos-
phorylation was observed at most phospho-tau epitopes,
including AT180 (T231) and AT270 (T181), in response to
Ab-CM, and this effect was partially restored by inhibition of
neuritic beading with either TBST or AP5. Furthermore, levels
of acetylated tubulin, a marker of stable microtubules, were
also restored by TBST. Thus, we conclude that neuroinflamma-
tory factors stimulate HDAC6-dependent tau re-localization,
tau hypo-phosphorylation at most common pathological tau
epitopes, and the formation of axonal and dendritic tau-1IR
beads.
In Vivo Neuritic Tau-1IR Pathology in the Mouse and
Human Brain
We considered whether the neuritic tau-1IR species detected
above could be recapitulated in vivo. Although endogenous tau
pathology is not typically detectable in normal wild-type mice,
we asked whether tau-1IR pathology might accumulate as a
consequence of aging, the major risk factor for AD. In contrast
to young mice that showed faint diffuse axonal tau-1 staining
patterns throughout the brain, aged 27-month-old mice showed
a striking accumulation of tau-1IR foci that were concentrated as
distinct patches or clusters throughout the hippocampus, partic-
ularly in CA1, and distributed more selectively throughout
cortical brain regions (Figure 4A). Tau-1IR clusters gradually
accumulated with age, as assessed by immunoblotting (Fig-
ure 4B), immunofluorescence (Figure 4C), and immunohisto-
chemistry (Figure 4D). These structures became more readily
detectable starting at around 12 months of age (see quantifica-
tion in Figure 4E).
We examined whether a neuroinflammatory challenge could
modulate tau-1 immunoreactivity in vivo in a manner similar to
our observations in vitro using Ab-CM (Figure 1). We employed
a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) injection paradigm in which a single
LPS dose (5 mg/kg) given to young 3-month-old mice was
sufficient to induce chronic long-term neuroinflammation up to
10 months after LPS injection (Qin et al., 2007). We observed
a significant increase in tau-1IR pathology in LPS-stimulated
mice compared with age-matched saline-injected controls (Fig-
ure 4F; see quantification in Figure 4G). Thus, tau-1IR pathology
accumulates as a general feature of normal brain aging and can
be accelerated by neuroinflammatory cues.

 To examine the nature of tau-1IR clusters in vivo, double-label-
ing of aged mouse brain sections was performed with tau-1 and
either ac-K280, T22, or MAP2 antibodies, all of which detected
neuritic tau beads in vitro. Similarly, in vivo tau-1IR clusters
were ac-K280-positive, strongly T22-immunoreactive, and also
partially accumulated in the dendritic compartment, as assessed
by co-localization with MAP2 (Figure 5A). We note that these
structures are labeled with the same antibodies that detected
tau-1IR foci in vitro and are not AT8-immunoreactive or detect-
able by standard Thioflavin S staining (Figure S6). Therefore,
tau-1IR pathology in the mouse brain appears to represent
a biochemically distinct age-related tau species. Similar to
Figure 3. Ab Oligomer-Induced Neuroinflammatory Stress Promotes Calcium Dysfunction in an HDAC6-Dependent Manner

loss or inhibition of HDAC6 (HDAC6 KO or TBST) or by pre-treatment with the NMDAR inhibitor AP5.

 HDAC6-mediated tau beading in vitro (Figure 2), tau-1IR clusters
were suppressed in the brains of HDAC6 KO mice (Figure 5B;
see quantification in Figure 5C). The reduced tau-1IR pathology
could potentially explain the restored cognitive function previ-
ously observed with HDAC6 depletion or inhibition (Govindarajan
et al., 2013; Selenica et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014).
Hyper-phosphorylated tau (e.g., AT8-immunoreactive tau) is
commonly used to monitor tau pathology in the human AD brain.
In contrast, dephosphorylated tau-1IR pathology, an epitope that
overlaps with AT8, has not been well studied in postmortem tis-
sue. However, because Ab facilitated the formation of tau-1IR pa-
thology in vitro, we asked whether tau-1 immunoreactivity was
associated with Ab plaque pathology in the AD brain. We per-
formed double-labeling with the tau-1 antibody and Thioflavin
S (ThS), the latter of which robustly marked AD neuritic plaques
and thread-like tau pathology. Indeed, tau-1 immunoreactivity
was clearly detected in a subset of neuritic plaques and tau inclu-
sions in the AD brain. As a control, neuritic plaques were immu-
noreactive with the Ab-specific 6E10 antibody (Figure 6A).
To further confirm tau-1IR pathology using biochemical
methods, we performed a sequential extraction of the frontal
cortex from control and AD brains and analyzed soluble and
insoluble tau species by immunoblotting (Figure 6B). We
observed a reduction of tau-1 immunoreactivity in soluble
high-salt fractions and a concomitant increase in the insoluble
tangle-rich fractions (i.e., tau aggregate smearing), consistent
with a conversion toward tau-1-positive pathology. Although
insoluble tau was also hyper-phosphorylated at other AD-rele-
vant epitopes (e.g., S396 and S262), the phospho-tau-immuno-
reactive banding patterns were distinct; they tended to show
high- and low-molecular-weight smearing compared with the
tau-1-immunoreactive bands that migrated preferentially as
monomeric tau species (Figure 6B, asterisk). Thus, in contrast
to global tau hyper-phosphorylation, dephosphorylated tau-1IR
pathology represents a significant pool of total pathological tau
in the AD brain.
Identification of Neurotoxic Factors Linked to Neuritic
Tau Beading
Given that Ab-CM likely consists of a mixture of secreted pro-
and anti-inflammatory immune factors (Williams et al., 2015),
we sought to identify the neurotoxic factor(s) responsible for
tau beading and excitotoxicity. To accomplish this, we profiled
Ab-CM using a mass spectrometry (MS)-based label-free quan-
titative (LFQ) approach. We identified a total of 1,472 proteins, of
which 817 proteins were identified with at least 2 unique pep-
tides (Table S2). The volcano plot demonstrates significance
(�logP) and changes that occurred in response to Ab oligomers
(Figure 7A; displayed as log2 AbO/untreated). Overall, 354 pro-
teins increased and 258 proteins decreased, with false discovery
rates (FDRs) < 5%. A biological function (Database for Annota-
tion, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery [DAVID]) analysis
of the 354 significantly induced hits identified factors that were
enriched in immune and inflammatory responses as well as
neuronal stress and apoptotic signaling pathways (Figure 7B).
Further cluster analysis identified two large networks of proteins
with shared functions in neuroinflammation and metabolism
(Figure S7).
Among the immune factors identified in Ab-CM, a set of matrix
metalloproteinases (MMP-1, 7, and 9) were significantly altered,
consistent with prior reports linking extracellular MMP activity to
AD progression (Mroczko et al., 2013; N€
ubling et al., 2012; Stom-
rud et al., 2010; Figure 7A; Figure S7). Because MMP-9 levels
have been shown previously to increase in AD patient cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF) (Stomrud et al., 2010) as well as induced plurip-
otent stem cell (iPSC) cell culture models of mutant tau-induced
frontotemporal dementia (FTD) (Biswas et al., 2016), we focused
on MMP-9 as a candidate factor that may partially mediate the
effects of Ab-CM on tau. In contrast to most MMP family mem-
bers, MMP-9 contains gelatinase activity, which is readily de-
tected by SDS-PAGE gels supplemented with gelatin. Serial
analysis of undiluted Ab-CM detected increased gelatinase ac-
tivity migrating �75–100 kD (Figure 7C, top), indicating that Ab
oligomers induced secretion of MMP-9. Moreover, direct immu-
noblotting of Ab-CM with an MMP-9-specific antibody also de-
tected active secreted MMP-9 that was not observed in the
absence of Ab oligomer stimulation (Figure 7C, bottom).
To test the effect of MMPs on neuritic beading, recombinant
purified MMP-7 or MMP-9 was directly added to neuronal cul-
tures. The final exposure concentration of MMP-9 (5 ng/mL) re-
flected known physiological MMP-9 concentrations in CSF
(Ichiyama et al., 2009). Although MMP-7 had little effect on focal
neuritic tau beading, MMP-9 generated tau-1IR foci that were
similar, although less pronounced, compared with complete
Ab-CM (Figure 7D, see quantification, right panel), suggesting
that MMP-9 can partially recapitulate neuritic tau beading. To
further evaluate whether MMP-9 induced calcium dysregulation,
live imaging was performed after recombinant MMP-9 addition
to neurons, which showed an increase in the rate and intensity
of calcium spikes (Figure 7E), consistent with previous reports
that MMP-9 is coupled to NMDAR activation (Michaluk et al.,
2009). The net effect of MMP-9 was a mild accumulation of

 intracellular calcium that recapitulated the pattern, but not the
full intensity, of the response to Ab-CM. These data suggest
that MMP-9 is sufficient to increase the vulnerability of neurons
to the development of tau-1IR pathology but is not solely respon-
sible. Importantly, the MMP-9-mediated calcium increase was
dependent on HDAC6 activity because TBST blunted calcium
spiking by �3-fold (Figure 7E, right). Finally, to assess the effect
of MMP-9 loss of function, we incubated Ab-CM with an MMP-9-
specific inhibitor prior to calcium imaging and observed an
�50% reduction in the acute-phase calcium rise (Figure 7F).
Thus, our proteomics approach uncovered a single neuroinflam-
matory factor, MMP-9, as one potential upstream mediator in
the pathological cascade leading to HDAC6-dependent tau-1IR
beading and calcium dysregulation.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we show that tau accumulation within neuritic
beads is an endogenous neuronal response to inflammatory per-
turbations. In a search for mediators of neuritic bead formation,
we identified the cytoplasmic deacetylase HDAC6 as a shuttling
factor required for tau re-localization and calcium-mediated ex-
citotoxicity. Further in vivo analysis of neuritic tau beading re-
vealed tau-1IR clusters in hippocampal and cortical regions of
aged wild-type mice, supporting the accumulation of dephos-
phorylated tau (at the tau-1 epitope) as a plausible early-stage in-
dicator of neuronal damage and/or vulnerability that precedes
overt tangle formation. Our data indicate that acetylated, hypo-
phosphorylated, and oligomeric tau accumulates at sites of focal

 calcium signaling in vulnerable neurons and could represent a
unique tau species that is primed to undergo subsequent matu-
ration and pathological aggregation during normal aging or the
progression of AD.
Toxic Ab induces a neuroinflammatory signature that coin-
cides with synaptic degeneration. However, most in vitro
neuronal models have not considered the effect of Ab on
neuroinflammation, potentially under-estimating its effects on
neuronal dysfunction. Our analysis of the Ab-induced secretome
by mass spectrometry identified a subset of secreted MMPs,
among which MMP-9 partially recapitulated neuritic bead forma-
tion and calcium dysregulation. Although the exact role for
MMP-9 in AD pathogenesis is not fully understood, MMP-9 is
implicated in neuronal activity through the activation of integrin
b1, leading to phosphorylation of NMDAR subunits (Michaluk
et al., 2009). MMP-9 levels are upregulated in AD and during epi-
leptogenesis, characterized by hyper-excitability and aberrant
NMDAR activity (Stomrud et al., 2010; Wilczynski et al., 2008).

 Thus, MMP-9 may be coupled to tau dysfunction similar to other
excitotoxic stimuli, including, for example, glutamate-induced
excitotoxicity, which also promotes tau hypo-phosphorylation
(Davis et al., 1995). Future studies are necessary to determine
the mechanism by which extracellular MMP-9 facilitates intracel-
lular tau mis-localization.
Tau is thought to represent �0.025%–0.25% of total brain pro-
tein (Khatoon et al., 1992). Thus, MT-dissociated tau requires
quality control mechanisms, including proteasome and auto-
phagy-dependent pathways, to maintain proteostasis. In healthy
neurons, the adaptor protein HDAC6 may bind tau and actively
shuttle tau for targeted sequestration or degradation. Prior
studies showed direct tau-HDAC6 binding via the tau MTBR
domain (Ding et al., 2008; Perez et al., 2009). Although HDAC6
is known to bind ubiquitinated cargo, it remains unclear whether
tau-1IR beads are active sites of tau triage and/or degradation.
We have not observed tau ubiquitination or degradation upon
treatment with Ab-CM despite the fact that 20S proteasomes
were partially concentrated within tau-1IR beads (Figure S4).
Alternatively, HDAC6 deacetylates and regulates a variety of
cytoplasmic factors, including MTs and heat shock proteins
(e.g., HSP70 and HSP90), that also directly interact with tau
(Yan 2014). Therefore, HDAC6 could shuttle tau to neuritic beads
indirectly via regulation of tau-associated adaptor, scaffolding,
and/or structural proteins (e.g., actin and MTs). Finally, HDAC6
also shuttles to the nucleus and regulates gene transcription
(Bertos et al., 2004; Verdel et al., 2000). Thus, it remains plausible
that inhibition of HDAC6 nuclear function could partly contribute
to the suppression of tau beading and excitotoxicity.
Our data suggest that, under neuroinflammatory conditions,
HDAC6-associated complexes could become trapped within
the damage-induced neuritic beads. The presence of HDAC6
initially suggested active deacetylation of tau, but, in contrast,
we observed increased K280-acetylated tau within beads.
Therefore, we speculate that HDAC6 activity may become
impaired within the dense beaded network along with other trap-
ped vesicles and degenerated cytoskeletal components, even-
tually leading to increased tau acetylation, NMDAR activation,
and calcium dysregulation. Increased intracellular calcium accu-
mulation could further exacerbate neuronal toxicity via activation
of downstream calcium-dependent enzymes, including calpain
and calcineurin, both of which have been implicated in Ab-in-
duced neurotoxicity (Kurbatskaya et al., 2016; Rozkalne et al.,
2011).
Prior studies indicated that acetylated tau impairs tau-MT
binding and enhances tau aggregation, toxicity, and synaptic
dysfunction (Cohen et al., 2011; Min et al., 2015; Tracy et al.,
2016). This is supported by our previous inability to detect robust
tau K280 acetylation in normal cultured neurons or control brain
tissue and by our current data showing that neuroinflammatory
stress may act as a trigger for the accumulation of acetylated
tau (Figure 1C). We speculate that tau acetylation is pathogenic
when highly concentrated within neuritic beads, which could
facilitate its aggregation or perturb the cytoskeleton and associ-
ated synaptic factors, including, for example, the recently
described kidney/brain protein (KIBRA) (Tracy et al., 2016). By
blocking HDAC6-dependent neuritic bead formation, aberrantly
modified tau may not have similarly pathogenic consequences.
Indeed, HDAC6 inhibition mildly induced tau acetylation (Fig-
ure S5), but this was coincident with a partial suppression of
neurotoxicity (Figure 2G), suggesting that enhanced tau acetyla-
tion does not necessarily correlate with neurotoxicity. A tau ace-
tyltransferase such as CBP/p300 could localize to tau beads to
facilitate tau acetylation. Alternatively, local acetyl coenzyme A
(CoA) accumulation within or surrounding beaded structures
may be sufficient to promote tau auto-acetylation and drive tau
aggregation in a localization- and concentration-dependent
manner (Cohen et al., 2013).
In contrast to tau acetylation, tau hyper-phosphorylation was
not prominently detected within neuritic beads, at least at several
of the phospho-tau epitopes examined. This is supported by
other studies showing that acetylated tau at residues K274 and
K281 led to neurotoxicity and synaptic defects with little
apparent hyper-phosphorylation at AD-relevant epitopes (Tracy
et al., 2016). Thus, hypo-phosphorylated but acetylated tau
could initially mark early-stage mislocalized tau, followed by
later-stage tau hyper-phosphorylation, a stepwise modification
scheme that may be required for maturation of tau aggregates
into NFTs. We propose that tau-1 immunoreactive pathology
could occur as an initial compensatory response in healthy but
vulnerable neurons, which could reflect adequate PP2A activity
and, hence, sufficient tau dephosphorylation until a certain
threshold is reached. Eventually, however, tau may be further
subjected to hyper-phosphorylation as a consequence of
disease progression. Such a fluctuating pattern of tau phos-
phorylation has been observed in vitro (Liang et al., 2009;
LoPresti and Konat 2001). Prolonged tau-1IR neuritic bead accu-
mulation in vitro, beyond the time frame allowable for cultured
primary neurons, may be required for impaired PP2A function,
tau re-phosphorylation, and accumulation of more mature tau
aggregates.
The notion that dephosphorylated tau (at the tau-1 epitope)
could be linked to tau pathology is plausible. Dephosphorylated
tau is known to associate with the neuronal membrane (Arrasate
et al., 2000; Maas et al., 2000; Pooler et al., 2012). The close
proximity of tau to the membrane could facilitate Fyn-mediated

 activation of NMDARs and increased intracellular calcium accu-
mulation. Although tau-1 immunoreactivity is rarely assessed as
a pathological marker per se in mouse and human tissues, we
detected tau-1-positive structures as distinct clusters in aged
mice, LPS-treated mice, and human AD brain, consistent with
a potential role for the tau-1IR species in tau pathogenesis (Fig-
ures 4 and 6). Whether the age-related tau-1IR pathology identi-
fied in this study is linked to primary age-related tauopathy
(PART) recently described in humans is not clear, but there are
intriguing parallels because both phenomena show clear age-
related tau deposition in the hippocampus (Crary et al., 2014).
We have begun to elucidate the biochemical properties of
tau-1IR structures; they are enriched with oligomeric, acetylated,
and hypo-phosphorylated tau at many AD-relevant epitopes
analyzed. We have not detected robust misfolded tau epitopes
(MC1 or Alz-50) or prominent amyloid conformation within tau
beaded structures. Future studies could establish whether other
brain pathologies, including TDP-43 or Ab, facilitate endogenous
tau-1IR pathology, which we cannot currently exclude. Last,
tau-1IR beading in vitro appears to be reversible upon removal
of Ab-CM. Thus, tau-1IR neuritic beads may represent a feature
of neuronal vulnerability that is amenable to pharmacological
intervention. Taken together, our study highlights a mechanism
linking neuroinflammatory stress to HDAC6-mediated neuritic
tau accumulation, which, we anticipate, will provide insights
into normal endogenous tau regulation, excitotoxic disease
mechanisms, and avenues for therapeutic interventions in AD.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Double-Label Immunofluorescence
Primary cortical neurons were grown on poly-D-lysine (PDL)-coated cover-
slips, cultured as described above, and treated for the indicated times. Cells
were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, rinsed three times in PBS,
and permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in PBS for 10 min. Cells
were then blocked in 2% milk for 1 hr and subsequently incubated with primary
antibodies of interest overnight at 4�C. Cells were washed in PBS and incu-
bated with Alexa 488- or Alexa 594-conjugated secondary antibody. Cells
were analyzed using an Olympus IX83 inverted microscope. The ratio of coloc-
alization with tau-1 was quantified by the number of beads that contained
immunoreactivity from both tau-1 and the antibody of interest among the
total number of tau-1-positive beads, using >5 fields, and the sampling error
was calculated using SEM. Statistical analysis was determined using a two-
tailed unpaired Student’s t test with unequal variance (significance set as
p < 0.05). All quantitative fluorescence was independently validated with a
minimum of 3 different biological replicates. Primary antibodies used for
immunofluorescence are listed in Table S1.
Live Calcium Imaging
Neuronal cultures were washed in 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesul-
fonic acid (HEPES)-buffered artificial CSF (aCSF; concentrations: 137 mM
NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.3 mM CaCl2, 1.3 mM MgCl2, 20 mM glucose, and 10 mM
HEPES [pH 7.4]) and preloaded with the calcium indicator Fluo-4 acetoxy-
methyl (AM) using the Fluo-4 NW Assay Kit (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) at
a 1:4 dilution. After 30 min, cultures were washed in aCSF, and 18-mm cover-
slips were mounted in a specialized stage for imaging (Warner Instruments).
Images were captured on an Olympus IX71 inverted microscope at a temper-
ature of 25�C, which provided stable background activity for at least 2 hr. TBST
was added to the coverslips 3 hr prior to the challenge, whereas the MARK2
inhibitor (39621, Millipore), AP5, and the MMP-9 inhibitor (Calbiochem) were
added 30 min prior to the challenge. The cells were challenged with CM
(from hMDMs or mouse microglia) at a 1:4 dilution, MMP-9 (50 ng/mL), or
MMP-7 (150 ng/mL). Time-lapse digital images were captured automatically
by the Metamorph system (Molecular Devices). Three pre-stimulation mea-
surements were taken to establish basal levels of fluorescence at the begin-
ning of each experiment. Acute changes in calcium were measured at
0.1-min intervals for 6 min. Delayed changes in calcium were measured at
1-min intervals for an additional 1 hr. The increase in calcium intensity (free
calcium) within each cell was then measured relative to the baseline measure-
ments to correct for cell-to-cell differences in dye loading and intrinsic fluores-
cence. Control cultures were stimulated with aCSF in the same fashion to
establish normal baseline calcium activity as well as any intrinsic toxic activity
from the cortical neuron cultures. Spikes were evaluated compared with the
control cultures. Calcium spiking frequency was calculated as the number of
spikes per 100 images.
Statistical Analysis
GraphPad Prism software was used for all statistical analyses. Results were
pooled from a minimum of three independent experiments and presented as
average ± SEM. Comparisons between two groups were analyzed using un-
paired Student’s t test. Significance is presented as *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, or
***p < 0.001. Hippocampal regions with tau-1IR clusters from at least 3 mice
per age group were thresholded using Metamorph software, and tau-1 inten-
sity was plotted as the overall tau-1IR density per hippocampal region. Three
isolated regions were chosen at random within the areas comprising tau-1IR
clusters. Sections from HDAC6 KO mice that lacked tau-1IR clusters were
used as negative controls to account for background staining intensity.
