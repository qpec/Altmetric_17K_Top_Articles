1. INTRODUCTION
Over 68 million Americans traveled abroad in 2014,1 and the annual number of international 
tourist arrivals worldwide has reached more than 1 billion.2 In data collected by 
GeoSentinel, a global surveillance network of international travelers, acute diarrhea was the 
most common amongst travel-related diagnostic groupings.3 In this article, we will review 
the epidemiology, etiology, and strategies to prevent and treat traveler’s diarrhea (TD).
1.A. Definition, Incidence and risk factors
TD is defined as the passage of 3 or more unformed stools per day with 1 or more associated 
enteric symptom, such as abdominal pain or cramps, occurring in a traveler after arrival, 
usually in a resource-limited destination.4
Recent studies have shown that approximately 25% of travelers develop TD in the first 2 
weeks abroad, with the highest rates occurring in travel to Africa and South, Central and 
West Asia.5,6 Factors that influence the incidence of TD vary based on the study design and 
location (Table 1).5,6,7
1.B. Etiology
TD is predominantly a fecal-orally transmitted disease and can be caused by bacterial, viral 
or protozoal pathogens, with helminths being uncommon. Many of the etiologies for TD 
(Table 2) are similar to those causing acute diarrhea in young children of low- and middle-
income countries.8 The frequency of each pathogen varies by geographic location and the

 etiology may be unknown in 40-50% of cases despite microbiologic evaluation,9,10 though 
with increasing use of multiplex molecular testing,11 this will likely change. Globally, 
enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) are the most 
common bacterial pathogens,9 with the exception of Southeast Asia, where Campylobacter 
is more common, a high proportion of which are fluoroquinolone resistant.9,12 Norovirus 
and rotavirus are the most common viral etiologies of TD. Of the protozoa, Giardia 
duodenalis and Entamoeba histolytica are the main pathogens considered, depending on the 
region of travel. In some instances, TD may be due to more than one pathogen.
1.C. Impact on the traveler
The median duration of TD is 3 days, and symptoms are usually mild, with approximately 4 
bowel movements per day.13 Unfortunately, TD can lead to significant limitation of activity. 
This incapacity typically lasts for 1-2 days,14 resulting in loss of vacation or business days,6 
though data from one post-travel survey suggests that the majority with TD do not need to 
alter their planned programs.15 Approximately 10% of travelers with TD seek medical care 
and up to 3% of them require hospitalization.14,16
2. PRE-TRAVEL PREPARATION
The goals of pre-travel consultation are to identify travelers at increased risk of travel-
related illness, and provide counseling, vaccinations and medications for prophylaxis or self-
treatment. Application of these principles at a pre-travel consultation may decrease the 
incidence of TD.
2.A. PREVENTION
2.A.i. IMPACT OF FOOD AND WATER HYGIENE MEASURES—Given that most 
cases of TD are caused by ingestion of contaminated food and water, it is thought that 
counseling on food and water hygiene measures reduces the risk of TD. However, there is 
little evidence that such precautions decrease the incidence of TD,6, 17 and it is likely that 
factors outside of a traveler’s control, such as poor restaurant hygiene, may have a higher 
impact. 17 Despite this, travelers should be educated on appropriate food and water 
precautions (Table 3),18 including frequent hand washing with soap.
2.A.ii. VACCINES—There are no vaccines available against TD in the United States at this 
time. The oral killed whole-cell cholera vaccine, Dukoral, which is available in Canada and 
Europe, contains a recombinant cholera toxin B subunit, which is homologous with the heat-
labile toxin (LT) of ETEC and by extension provides partial protection against TD. 
Unfortunately, worldwide, only approximately 25% of ETEC strains are LT-only (most 
express or co-express the heat-stable toxin, ST).19 In a recent non-randomized evaluation, 
the vaccine was found to provide 28% protection against TD.20 Several vaccine candidates 
against ETEC are in various phases of development, including consideration of a combined 
ETEC/Shigella vaccine, targeting both travelers and children living in endemic countries.21
2.A.iii. PROBIOTICS—The use of probiotics for the prevention of TD is controversial and 
suffers from a lack of well- controlled studies. The challenges with using probiotic products

 include the diversity of probiotic strains, the need for adequate quality control of products, 
defined optimal dose and duration of therapy, and specific storage requirements of some 
products. Attempts at systematic review of available studies have produced mixed results. 
One pooled meta-analysis of 12 randomized controlled trials showed that probiotics may be 
safe and effective at preventing TD,22 with Saccharomyces boulardii and a mixture of 
Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium bifidum found to be efficacious. A 
subsequent review found that S. boulardii afforded a dose- related protection for travelers to 
North Africa and Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG provided 12-45% protection against 
TD.23 In contrast, a meta-analysis that reviewed 5 randomized controlled trials did not find 
any benefit from probiotic use.24 More data are needed before definitive recommendations 
can be made on the use of probiotics for prevention of TD.
2.A.iii BISMUTH SUBSALICYLATE—Bismuth subsalicyclate (BSS) has been shown to 
provide up to 65% protection against TD when taken as 2 tablets 4 times per day for a 
maximum of 3 weeks.25 It is usually well tolerated in young healthy adults. However, 
clinicians must warn travelers about blackening of the stool or tongue when taking this drug. 
BSS can decrease absorption of doxycycline, which may be used concomitantly for malaria 
prophylaxis.26 A careful review of the traveler’s medication list should be performed to look 
for potential drug-drug interactions. Although BSS provides moderate protection against 
TD, the need for frequent administration decreases the overall compliance and makes it a 
less attractive choice for most travelers.
2.A.iv. ANTIBIOTIC CHEMOPROPHYLAXIS—Antibiotic chemoprophylaxis can 
provide up to 90% protection against TD.27 Fluoroquinolones are effective prophylactic 
agents and they provide a broad spectrum of activity against many common travel-related 
enteropathogens including ETEC and EAEC. In a meta-analysis, they were shown to 
provide 88% protection against TD.27 However, the risks of long term quinolone therapy, 
including tendon rupture (especially in those with pre-existing kidney disease or on systemic 
corticosteroids), QTc prolongation, and Clostridium difficile infection limit their usefulness 
as prophylaxis and should be discussed with the traveler.
Prophylactic rifaximin can provide up to 77% protection against TD,28 though its 
effectiveness in SE Asia is lower (48% efficacy).29 It is poorly absorbed from the 
gastrointestinal tract, and thus systemic side effects are rare. However, rifaximin has poor 
activity against many enteroinvasive pathogens, and this is reflected in its decreased efficacy 
in SE.29 Thus, the potential need for use of a second antimicrobial agent in case of invasive 
disease, as well as its high cost relative to quinolones (Table 4), makes rifaximin a less 
attractive candidate.
For travelers to areas of SE Asia where there are high rates of quinolone resistance, it is 
reasonable to consider prophylaxis with azithromycin but there is minimal data for its use in 
travelers and the safety of prophylactic use of azithromycin is extrapolated from studies in 
cystic fibrosis and HIV patients.
The advantages and efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis are tempered by the risks of side 
effects, C. difficile infection, acquisition of antimicrobial resistant organisms, and cost.

 Thus, we recommend that its use only be reserved for high risk travelers such as those who 
are immunosuppressed or those in whom an episode of TD may lead increased morbidity.27 
While chemoprophylaxis may also be considered in travelers with little flexible time, such 
as politicians, athletes or performers, early self-treatment (discussed below) may be more 
appropriate.
2.B. TRAVELER-INITIATED SYMPTOMATIC TREATMENT
Self-treatment upon initial symptoms is the mainstay of traveler’s diarrhea management, the 
backbone of which is oral rehydration therapy. Adding to that backbone, for mild cases, the 
use of bismuth and loperamide is effective and sufficient. For moderate or severe TD, use of 
empiric oral antibiotics has been found to be effective in shortening the duration of 
symptoms, though there is increasing evidence that this practice may have societal and 
personal health costs.
2.B.i. ORAL REHYDRATION—Adequate oral fluid intake is essential to both prevent and 
treat dehydration related to TD. For mild dehydration, simply increasing the amount of oral 
fluid intake with clean water and/or readily available fluids is adequate. For moderate or 
severe dehydration, and particularly in children, elderly and those with chronic medical 
conditions, we recommend WHO-formulated oral rehydration salts (ORS),30 which have 
been shown to be similar in efficacy as IV fluids in children presenting to a US ER.31 ORS 
can be prepared at home (Box 1),32 or it is available as packaged commercial products sold 
in pharmacies and stores worldwide. Commonly used beverages such as Gatorade, apple 
juice or soft drinks may not be appropriate for repletion of moderate or severe dehydration 
due to their high sugar and low salt content, though data comparing their use with ORS is 
lacking.
2.B.ii. ANTI-DIARRHEAL MEDICATION—Loperamide is safe and effective for 
treatment of nondysenteric TD.33 It can be used alone for mild cases and as an adjunct with 
antibiotics (see below) for moderate or severe TD. A meta- analysis found that compared to 
antibiotic therapy alone, adjunctive loperamide decreased the duration of illness and 
increased the probability of cure.33
Apart from BSS being used to prevent TD, it can also be used to treat TD. It has been shown 
to reduce the passage of unformed stools and it may be useful for treatment of mild TD.34 
However, when compared to loperamide, it has a delayed onset of action and it is less 
effective, with estimates of loperamide providing just over 50% reduction in passage of 
unformed stools compared to BSS providing a 16-18% reduction.34
2.B.iii. EARLY ANTIBIOTIC SELF TREATMENT—Early self-treatment of TD with 
antibiotic therapy has been shown to be effective at reducing the duration of symptoms.35 In 
a randomized placebo-controlled trial, early self-treatment of TD with ciprofloxacin reduced 
the duration of symptoms from 81 to 29 hours.35 We recommend offering travelers a 
prescription of antibiotics for early self-treatment, but emphasizing its use only for moderate 
to severe TD and for dysentery. Antibiotics can be given as a single dose regimen or as a

 multiple dose regimen for up to 3 days (Table 5). For travelers on the multiple dose 
regimens, if the symptoms resolve after 1 or 2 doses the antibiotic therapy can be stopped.
The antibiotic agent selected should be tailored to the region of travel and the prevalence of 
multi-drug resistant pathogens in that region. Either ciprofloxacin or rifaximin may be used 
for most global destinations, but travelers to South and Southeast Asia should receive 
azithromycin, given the high incidence of quinolone resistant enteropathogens.12 Rifaximin 
use is often limited by cost. Notably, azithromycin and levofloxacin (though not 
ciprofloxacin) has been associated with increased risk of ventricular arrhythmia and 
cardiovascular death,36 and given the risk of electrolyte imbalances during severe diarrhea, a 
high level of caution should be used when prescribing these agents in patients with pre-
existing heart disease, and should be avoided in those with known QT-prolongation.
A number of recent reports have associated the use of antibiotics for TD with an increased 
risk of acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) enterobacteriaceae 
organisms.37,38 While the persistence of ESBL colonization in returning travelers appears to 
be relatively short, and no infection has been directly linked to such colonization, the 
longterm societal and personal health consequences are not known. Thus, we recommend 
education and discussions regarding appropriate use of antibiotics, including mention of the 
self-resolving nature of most cases of TD, and the risks associated with antibiotic use, 
including their side effects, C. difficile infection, and acquisition of multidrug-resistant 
bacteria. Other factors to be considered are the availability of appropriate medical care, and 
the safety and purity of antibiotics, in the destination country.
2.B.iv. WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE—A TD pre-travel kit (Box 2) is a useful tool 
that can limit the duration of TD and its impact on the traveler. Travelers should be 
encouraged to carry this kit during their trip and they should be counseled on how to use it 
effectively. However, they should seek medical care for persistent fever, chills, bloody 
diarrhea, moderate to severe abdominal pain, intractable vomiting, if they are unable to 
retain oral fluid intake, or if their symptoms worsen or persist despite early self- treatment. 
Special traveler populations are more at risk for severe and complicated TD and these 
travelers should have a low threshold to seek medical attention. Information on clinics in 
destination countries specializing in travel medicine can be obtained from the International 
Society of Travel Medicine (http://www.istm.org/AFCstmClinicDirectory.asp), or the 
International Association for Medical Assistance to Travellers (https://www.iamat.org)
3. SPECIAL POPULATIONS
3.A. PREGNANT WOMEN
Pregnant women may be more prone to TD due to reduced gastric acidity and slowed 
intestinal motility.39 In one study, TD occurred in 11% of pregnant travelers to developing 
countries.40 The main pre-travel advice for pregnant women are counseling on food and 
water hygiene as well as ensuring adequate fluid hydration.39 Antimicrobial 
chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for pregnant travelers. Clinicians must be wary of 
medication use and their potential for adverse pregnancy outcome, fetal harm and secretion 
of medications into breast milk. BSS and fluoroquinolones are not recommended in 
Giddings et al.

 pregnancy, and loperamide and rifaximin are pregnancy class C drugs. Azithromycin, which 
is pregnancy class B, is the drug of choice for early self-treatment of TD.
3.B. CHILDREN
Infants and young children with TD have a more severe and prolonged course of disease, 
and are more likely to present with fever and bloody diarrhea.41,42 The mainstay of 
treatment is rehydration and parents should be advised on appropriate oral rehydration 
solution. Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis, loperamide and BSS are usually not 
recommended for this population and parents should have a low threshold to seek medical 
care if the child develops bloody diarrhea, fever with temperature > 101.5 F, moderate to 
severe dehydration, persistent vomiting, or for any changes in mental status. For antibiotic 
self-treatment, azithromycin is the drug of choice.42 While trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
has been used in the past, due to increasing resistance worldwide, we recommend cefixime 
or other third-generation cephalosporins as second-line agents, though they may be 
ineffective against campylobacter.43 Fluoroquinolones are not recommended in children less 
than 18 years due to potential for cartilage damage based on animal studies, but there is 
ongoing review on the safety of this drug in children, and it may have a role in targeted 
treatment of multidrug-resistant enteropathogens.44
3.C. IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOST
The immunocompromised host would benefit from a multidisciplinary evaluation prior to 
travel so that travel related issues including prevention and management of TD can be 
discussed.45 Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis for TD should be considered,45 though there 
is increased potential for drug-drug interactions in this population. Immunocompromised 
host travelers also need to have a contingency plan in case of a medical emergency, this plan 
should include medical contact both locally and abroad.
3.D. COMORBID DISEASE
Travelers with comorbid disease such as insulin dependent diabetes mellitus, heart failure or 
renal insufficiency may not be able to tolerate an episode of TD, as it can lead to severe 
electrolyte imbalance and dehydration with subsequent exacerbation of their underlying 
medical condition. The importance of ensuring adequate hydration must be stressed to these 
travelers. Antimicrobial chemoprophylaxis and early self-treatment options must be 
discussed in relation to their comorbidities and careful attention to their home medication 
list and potential drug-drug interactions must be noted. The risk of ventricular arrhythmia 
and cardiovascular death with azithromycin and levofloxacin are important considerations.36
4. POST-TRAVEL MANAGEMENT
TD can occur, or persist, after the traveler has returned home. The time to onset of 
symptoms would depend on the incubation period of the pathogen. Typically this would be 
up to 2 weeks after return from travel but this incubation period may be longer when 
protozoa or helminths are the etiologic agents.

 4.A. PERSISTENT DIARRHEA AFTER TRAVEL
Infectious gastrointestinal disease accounts for approximately 30% of diagnoses of returning 
travelers who present for medical care.46 Common pathogens associated with diarrheal 
illness in returned travelers include bacterial causes with longer incubation periods (such as 
Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella), protozoa (Giardia, cryptosporidium, cyclospora, 
Entamoeba histolytica, and Dientamoeba fragilis), as well as helminthes such as Ascaris, 
Strongyloides, and hookworms. In particular, if there is a history of antibiotic use, 
Clostridium difficile infection should also be considered.47
4.A.i. EVALUATION—A detailed history and physical examination should be performed 
in all travelers seeking medical care for diarrhea on return home. This should include 
information on areas visited during their trip and specific exposures that may provide clues 
to the etiology. Drug resistant pathogens must also be considered, taking into account the 
region of travel and prior antibiotic therapy Consultation with a travel medicine expert may 
be useful and work up may include a complete blood count (CBC) with differential 
(eosinophilia may suggest helminthic infection), and stool for microscopy (ova and 
parasites), and antigen-based testing. Clostridium difficile testing may also be warranted. 
Serological investigation for Strongyloides and Schistosoma may also be obtained when 
clinically indicated. Recent advances in molecular diagnostics have led to the development 
and marketing of a number of stool multiplex PCR panels for gastrointestinal pathogens 
(Table 6). There is a lack of published studies examining the utility of such panels in 
returning travelers, though there may be benefits with respect to their sensitivity, cost- 
effectiveness, and timeliness, compared to traditional methods. However, results from such 
panels in returning travelers need to be interpreted with caution, given the likelihood of 
multiple pathogens identified.
4.B. POST-INFECTIOUS SEQUELAE
4.B.i. POST-INFECTIOUS IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (PI-IBS)—Travel-
associated diarrhea afflicts a relatively large proportion of international travelers, and the 
majority experience complete recovery without further symptoms. In some, however, 
despite clearance of the infectious pathogen from the gut, there is persistence or recurrence 
of abdominal symptoms, similar to that described for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).48,49 It 
is unclear whether the pathogenesis of travel-related IBS, especially that experienced by 
longterm travelers,48 is the same as that of non-travel-associated PI-IBS. Possible 
mechanisms include a reversible small intestinal enteropathy such as described in the 1970s 
in Peace Corp Volunteers returning from Pakistan,50 also known as “tropical enteropathy” in 
residents of low-income countries,51 tropical sprue, or the unmasking of an underlying 
gastrointestinal disorder.52 Nevertheless, many patients do meet Rome III diagnostic criteria 
for irritable bowel syndrome, and overall, approximately 3-20% of travelers develop post-
infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS), with most cases being diarrhea-predominant.
Known risk factors for developing post-infectious IBS (PI-IBS) include duration of initial 
illness, severity of initial illness, smoking, degree of gut inflammation, female gender, 
presence of stress at the time of the initial illness.53 Gulf War Veterans in particular seem to 
have increased risk of developing PI-IBS.54

 It is possible that treatment modalities commonly used for traveler’s diarrhea, such as 
antibiotics and anti-motility agents, may not only alter the course of traveler’s diarrhea, but 
may also impact its potential to develop PI-IBS. However, these associations are poorly 
understood and not well studied. Despite recent studies showing the efficacy of rifaximin for 
IBS,55 it has not been evaluated in PI-IBS, and at this point we do not recommend its use in 
returning travelers. Further investigation into the microbiota and mucosal immune correlates 
of post-travel IBS are warranted.
While the prognosis of post-travel PI-IBS is unknown, a recent study of post-Shigella IBS 
patients showed that roughly half of patients with PI-IBS recovered by 5 years after onset, 
but also that patients with a history of IBS prior to infection were more likely to have a 
prolonged course of illness beyond 5 years.56
4.B.ii. REACTIVE ARTHRITIS—Reactive arthritis can occur 1 to 4 weeks after an 
episode of TD.49,57 It is an oligoarthritis that is asymmetric and typically involves the lower 
limbs or sacroiliac joint. It can have an acute self- limited course lasting months or lead to 
chronic (refractory) symptoms for years.49,57 Several TD pathogens, including Shigella, 
Campylobacter, Salmonella and E.coli, have been associated with reactive arthritis, and host 
factors such as HLA B27 are also implicated.49
4.B.iii. GUILLAIN-BARRE SYNDROME—Guillain-Barre syndrome may also develop 1 
to 4 weeks after a bout of TD.49 The preceding enteric infection is usually due to 
Campylobacter, although other enteric gram-negative bacteria can trigger this phenomenon, 
in which an autoimmune response is mounted against peripheral nerves leading to peripheral 
neuropathy or acute neuromuscular failure.49 There is a bimodal peak in incidence with 
young adults and the elderly most commonly affected. This disease can result in permanent 
disability or even death.
5. SUMMARY
TD is the most common travel-related illness. Pre-travel consultation by the healthcare 
provider is an excellent opportunity to educate the traveler and provide them with resources 
to decrease the incidence and impact of the disease. Early self-treatment is an effective 
strategy for moderate to severe TD, though its benefits must be weighed against risks of 
adverse effects and acquisition of antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Persistent diarrhea and 
post infectious sequelae of TD can present after return from travel, and such travelers may 
benefit from specialist referral.

 KEY POINTS
-Traveler’s diarrhea (TD) is the most common travel related illness.
-Pre-travel consultation is an opportunity to provide the traveler with education and 
therapeutic options to decrease the incidence and impact of TD.
-Early self-treatment of TD is effective, though its use must be balanced by 
consideration of medication side effects, acquisition of antimicrobial resistant 
organisms through disturbance of gut flora, and potential for Clostridium difficile 
infection
-Post-infectious sequelae of TD may result in presentation for care weeks or months 
after return from travel

 SYNOPSIS
TD is the most common travel related illness and it can have a significant impact on the 
traveler. Pre-travel consultation provides an excellent opportunity for the clinician to 
counsel the traveler and discuss strategies such as food and water hygiene, vaccinations 
and medications for prophylaxis or self-treatment that may decrease the incidence and 
impact of TD. Post-infectious sequelae such as post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome, 
reactive arthritis and Guillain-Barre syndrome may develop weeks or months after return.
