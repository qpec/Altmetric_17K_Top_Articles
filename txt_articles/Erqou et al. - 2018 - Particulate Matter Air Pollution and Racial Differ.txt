acial differences in mortality and cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) morbidity pose challenges for health care in the United 
States and worldwide.1–4 Understanding the role of environmental 
pollution in race-related differences in CVD risk factors and clinical 
CVD outcome may elucidate a pathophysiologic mechanism for 
such differences and guide preventive strategies. Epidemiological 
studies have shown that chronic exposure to airborne fine particu-
late matter (particles with median aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm 
[PM2.5]) is associated with increased CVD risk and mortality.5–8
Although the pathophysiological underpinnings of these 
associations are not fully understood, potential mechanisms 
identified in animal and human studies include increased oxida-
tive stress and inflammation leading to endothelial dysfunction, 
atherosclerotic plaque progression, and thrombosis.5,9–11 Studies 
of black carbon (BC), a component of ultrafine particulate mat-
ter used as a tracer for diesel related emissions, have yielded 
less consistent results.12,13
Epidemiological data also indicate that racial/ethnic minori-
ties are more likely to reside in areas close to environmental 
pollution sources, including point sources and heavy roadway 
traffic areas.14–17 However, racial differences in the exposure to 
environmental air pollution and their role in disparities in CVD 
risk and mortality have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we 
assessed racial differences in urban air pollution exposures to 
PM2.5 and BC and their association with CVD risk factors and 
incident CVD events and all-cause mortality in the HeartSCORE 
study (Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation), a 
community-based cohort in Western Pennsylvania that is pro-
spectively examining racial differences in CVD risk and out-
comes since 2003.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
HeartSCORE is an ongoing community-based prospective cohort 
study of 2000 participants with approximately equal representation of 
blacks (44%) and whites (56%) assessing racial and socioeconomic 
disparities in cardiovascular risk. The methods of HeartSCORE have 
been described previously.18,19 Eligibility criteria included age 45 to 
75 years at study entry, residence in the greater Pittsburgh, PA, metro-
politan area, ability to undergo baseline and annual follow-up visits,

Objective—We aimed to assess racial differences in air pollution exposures to ambient fine particulate matter (particles with 
median aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm [PM2.5]) and black carbon (BC) and their association with cardiovascular disease 
(CVD) risk factors, arterial endothelial function, incident CVD events, and all-cause mortality.
Approach and Results—Data from the HeartSCORE study (Heart Strategies Concentrating on Risk Evaluation) were 
used to estimate 1-year average air pollution exposure to PM2.5 and BC using land use regression models. Correlates of 
PM2.5 and BC were assessed using linear regression models. Associations with clinical outcomes were determined using 
Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for traditional CVD risk factors. Data were available on 1717 participants 
(66% women; 45% blacks; 59±8 years). Blacks had significantly higher exposure to PM2.5 (mean 16.1±0.75 versus 
15.7±0.73µg/m3; P=0.001) and BC (1.19±0.11 versus 1.16±0.13abs; P=0.001) compared with whites. Exposure to PM2.5, 
but not BC, was independently associated with higher blood glucose and worse arterial endothelial function. PM2.5 was 
associated with a higher risk of incident CVD events and all-cause mortality combined for median follow-up of 8.3 years. 
Blacks had 1.45 (95% CI, 1.00–2.09) higher risk of combined CVD events and all-cause mortality than whites in models 
adjusted for relevant covariates. This association was modestly attenuated with adjustment for PM2.5.
Conclusions—PM2.5 exposure was associated with elevated blood glucose, worse endothelial function, and incident CVD 
events and all-cause mortality. Blacks had a higher rate of incident CVD events and all-cause mortality than whites that 
was only partly explained by higher exposure to PM2.5.

and absence of known comorbidities expected to limit life expec-
tancy to <5 years. The Institutional Review Board at the University 
of Pittsburgh approved the study protocol, and all study participants 
provided written informed consent. The present study included 1717 
participants who had available data on air pollution exposures to 
ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and BC. Data are available 
from authors on request for the purposes of replicating the study.
Exposure Determination
We estimated chronic exposures to urban PM2.5 and BC for the year 
before each individual’s baseline clinical date, using adapted versions 
of previously published land use regression methods, incorporating 
AERMOD (AMS/EPARegulatory Model) dispersion models to bet-
ter account for the influence of local point sources, as reported in the 
National Emissions Inventory (https://www.epa.gov/air-emissions-
inventories/2014-national-emissions-inventory-nei-data)20,21 
Hybrid 
land use regression models (including AERMOD dispersion model 
terms) were derived from a spatial monitoring campaign including 37 
sampling sites distributed across metropolitan Pittsburgh during sum-
mer (June 5 to July 26, 2012) and winter (January 8 to March 10, 2013). 
Geographic information system–based covariates were calculated to 
capture variability in a range of pollution source indicators (eg, traffic 
density, industrial emissions, population).20 Hybrid land use regression 
models were developed as mixed models adjusted for repeated mea-
sures at each site by season, predicting spatial variation in PM2.5 and BC 
as a function of the geographic information system–based source den-
sity indicators. We geocoded participant addresses using a composite 
address locator in ArcGIS 10.4 (ESRI 2016) to generate point features 
of residential locations. We used the land use regression models to esti-
mate the mean concentrations of PM2.5 and BC for the 300 m surround-
ing each participant’s residential address, for the 12 months before the 
month of each participant’s baseline clinical date, using daily regulatory 
data from a centrally located US EPA Air Quality System monitor.20,21
Covariates and Dependent Variables
Demographic and medical histories were collected at the baseline 
visit (2001–2004). Race was self-reported. Participants completed 
demographic questionnaire including information on marital/cohab-
iting status, education, and income. Highest education level was cat-
egorized as less than high school, beyond high school to Bachelor’s 
degree, and beyond Bachelor’s degree. Annual income was collected 
in categories <$10K, $20 to 40K, $40 to 80K, and >$80K. Physical 
measurements included measurement of vital signs and body fat dis-
tribution. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure >140/90 or use 
of antihypertensive medications. Body mass index was calculated as 
weight/height2 (kg/m2). Laboratory assessments of cholesterol levels 
were performed on venous blood drawn in the fasting state using the 
commercially available vertical auto profile technique (Atherotech, 
Birmingham, AL). Fasting blood glucose was measured using the 
glucose oxidase method. Measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive 
protein was performed using an immunoturbidimetric assay on the 
Roche P Modular system (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN), 
using reagents and calibrators from DiaSorin (Stillwater, MN). 
Serum interleukin-6 concentrations were measured using commer-
cially available ELISA assay kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN).
Endothelial function was measured using an Endo-PAT2000 device 
(Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) adapted from the protocol used by the 
Framingham Heart Study as previously reported.18,19,22 In brief, digital 
pulse amplitude was measured using the peripheral arterial tonometry 
(PAT) device placed on the tip of each index finger. Baseline PAT signal 
was measured for 5 minutes on both fingers. Arterial flow was then inter-
rupted on 1 finger by applying occlusive arm pressure. After 5 minutes, 
the cuff pressure was abruptly deflated, and PAT signal was measured on 
both fingers for the subsequent 5 minutes. The data were recorded elec-
tronically and analyzed using a computerized, automated algorithm. Pulse 
amplitude response to hyperemia was calculated from the hyperemic fin-
gertip as the ratio of the postocclusion pulse amplitude to the baseline-
pulse amplitude. The result was divided by the corresponding ratio in 
the control hand to give the PAT ratio (also known as reactive hyperemia 
index). The Framingham reactive hyperemia index (fRHI) was calculated 
as the natural log-transformation of the reactive hyperemia index.19,22
Clinical Outcomes (All-Cause Mortality 
and Incident CVD Events)
Participants were assessed for incident hospitalization and CVD 
events by semiannual questionnaires and during annual follow-up 
study visits. Incident CVD events were pre-defined as nonfatal myo-
cardial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, stroke, coronary revas-
cularization, or cardiac death. The primary outcome of interest was a 
combination of CVD events and all-cause mortality. Medical records 
were obtained for each reported hospitalization. A research nurse and 
study physician adjudicated incident events independently. Cause of 
death as cardiac or noncardiac was ascertained by review of the death 
certificate obtained from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Statistical Methods
Baseline variables are presented by tertiles of PM2.5 and BC. We also 
presented baseline variables by race in complementary analyses. 
Continuous variables are expressed as means (SD), and categorical 
variables are expressed as proportions. Associations of PM2.5 and BC 
with CVD risk factors were assessed using linear regression models, 
adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, and race. Further adjustment 
was made for income and education status to assess the impact of 
socioeconomic status. Potential effect modification of the associations 
of PM2.5 or BC with CVD risk factors by race or sex was investigated 
by fitting interactions terms between race or sex and the pollutants.
The associations of PM2.5 and BC with incident CVD outcome and 
all-cause mortality were examined using multivariable-adjusted Cox 
proportional hazards models. The assumptions of the proportionality 
of hazards were evaluated using Schoenfeld residuals. Follow-up time 
was determined by calculating the duration (in years) from the date of 
initial visit to the date of event, date of last follow-up, or the date of 
censoring, which was on August 7, 2014. Adjustment was made for 
income and education status, as in the linear regression models.
We performed a mediation analyses to assess the potential role 
of air pollution in explaining the association between black race and 
clinical outcomes by adding PM2.5 or BC to Cox proportional haz-
ards models relating race and CVD outcomes, with adjustment for 
CVD risk factors, namely, age, sex, smoking, systolic blood pres-
sure, diabetes mellitus, body mass index, total cholesterol, and high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol. The analyses were conducted using 
the methods described by Ananth and VanderWeele,23 based on the 
direct and indirect effects estimated for black race, as computed on 
the risk difference scale. Given the high correlation between race and 
socioeconomic status, we did not include markers of socioeconomic 
status in the model used for mediation analyses. All analyses were 
performed with Stata software (Stata Corp, version 11, TX). A P<0.05 
was considered statistically significant. Study data are available from 
the authors on request for the purposes of replicating the study.

tertiles of PM2.5 and BC in Table 1 and Table I in the online-
only Data Supplement, respectively. The median estimated 
PM2.5 exposure was 15.7 µg/m3 (range: 14.3–19.1; interquar-
tile range: 15.3–16.4). The median estimate of BC concen-
tration was 1.16 abs (range: 0.93–1.92; interquartile range: 
1.09–1.24). The mean (SD) estimates of PM2.5 and BC con-
centrations were 15.7±0.77 µg/m3 and 1.17±0.12 abs, respec-
tively. Blacks had, on average, higher exposures to PM2.5 
and BC than did whites. Mean PM2.5 among blacks was 16.1 
(SD=0.75) µg/m3 versus 15.7 (0.73) µg/m3 among white. 
Mean BC exposure among blacks was 1.19 (SD=0.11) abs 
versus 1.16 (0.13) abs among whites (Figure 1). The baseline 
characteristics of the participants by race is shown in Table II 
in the online-only Data Supplement.
In univariate models, PM2.5 was correlated with a broad 
spectrum of factors. For example, PM2.5 exposures decreased 
with increasing income. There was also linear increase in 
mean blood glucose, body mass index, and interleukin-6 con-
centrations and decrease in arterial endothelial function across 
tertiles of PM2.5 (Table 1). There were similar but weaker pat-
terns of associations for BC (Table I in the online-only Data 
Supplement).
Multivariable Correlates of PM2.5 and BC
The black–white participant difference in exposure to PM2.5 
and BC remained statistically significant after adjustment for 
age, sex, smoking status, income, and education. Furthermore, 
higher PM2.5 exposures were associated with higher systolic

blood pressure, body mass index, blood glucose, and interleu-
kin-6 and lower fRHI (ie, worse endothelial function) in age- 
and sex-adjusted models (Table 2). The associations of PM2.5 
with glucose and fRHI remained statistically significant after 
further adjusting for smoking, race, income, and education. 
Each 1.5-µg/m3 higher concentration of PM2.5 was associated 
with a 3.7-mg/dL (95% CI, 1.0–6.4) increase in blood glucose 
levels and a 0.06-U (95% CI, 0.00–0.11) decrease in fRHI in 
the fully-adjusted model (Table 2). The associations between 
PM2.5 and CVD risk factors did not vary significantly by sex or 
race (P value for interaction >0.05 for all). There were similar 
patterns but statistically nonsignificant associations observed 
for BC (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).
Environmental Pollutants, Race, and 
Incident CVD and Mortality Outcome
Over a median follow-up period of 8.3 years (12 888 person-
years of follow-up), 140 incident events (70 deaths and 70 
nonfatal CVD events) were observed. Each 1.5-µg/m3 higher 
concentration of PM2.5 was associated with 1.39 (95% CI, 
0.96–1.83) increase in hazard ratio of combined all-cause 
mortality and CVD events, after adjusting for age and sex. The 
association was similar after further adjustment for race and 
CVD risk factors. BC was not significantly associated with 
events (Figure 2).
Blacks had 1.45 (95% CI, 1.00–2.09) higher risk of com-
bined incident CVD events and all-cause mortality than whites 
in models adjusted for traditional CVD risk factors. This asso-
ciation was modestly attenuated to 1.34 (0.91, 1.96) with 
adjustment for PM2.5 (Table 3). Mediation analyses showed 
that 24% of the association between race and combined clini-
cal outcome is mediated by exposure to PM2.5. The association 
between race and clinical outcome was no longer significant 
with adjustment for income and education (Table 3).
Discussion
We found that blacks had significantly higher exposures to air 
pollutants (PM2.5, BC) and an increased risk of the combined 
end point of CVD events and death in a community-based 
cohort of adults in Western Pennsylvania. Particulate matter 
air pollution measured by PM2.5 was also independently asso-
ciated with increased risk of combined CVD events and all-
cause mortality as well as with elevated blood glucose and 
worse endothelial function after accounting for potential con-
founders, including race. The increased risk of clinical events 
in blacks was partly mediated by exposure to PM2.5.There was 
no significant association of BC with clinical outcomes.
This study contributes toward a better understanding of 
the mechanism of racial differences in CVD events and mor-
tality. Our findings suggest that higher exposures to PM2.5 may 
contribute to the racial differences in CVD outcomes observed 
in the Heart SCORE cohort and is consistent with previous 
studies reporting associations between airborne fine particu-
late matter and CVD.5–8,24 The association of black race with 
higher risk of combined CVD events and all-cause mortality 
in our study was attenuated with adjustment for PM2.5. Indeed, 
mediation analyses showed that ≈24% of the association 
observed between race and CVD events and all-cause mor-
tality may be explained by exposure to PM2.5. However, this 
association was no longer statistically significant in models 
adjusting for markers of socioeconomic status (ie, income 
and education), suggesting that socioeconomic status, race, 
and exposure to environmental pollutants have complex and 
interdependent relationships with CVD events and mortality. 
Given the high correlation between race and socioeconomic 
status, we did not include markers of socioeconomic status in 
the model used for mediation analyses.
Our findings also suggest potential mechanisms for the 
associations of PM2.5 with CVD and mortality, which may 
include hyperglycemia and endothelial dysfunction. These 
findings complement prior epidemiological and basic science 
studies of the mechanistic pathways that relate environmental 
pollution and CVD.5,25–29 By contrast, the association of PM2.5 
with interleukin-6, body mass index, and blood pressure was 
attenuated and no longer significant after adjusting for race, 
income, and education in the present study although prior 
studies have indicated significant associations, in particular 
with inflammatory variables.9,30,31 The attenuation of the asso-
ciation observed in this study may be because of the intricate 
relationships that likely exist between race, socioeconomic

tory mileu, including confounding, effect modification, and 
effect mediation.
We observed a similar pattern of associations between 
BC and the various CVD outcomes as was observed for PM2.5 
although effects were not statistically significant. Reported 
data supporting associations between BC and CVD outcomes 
are limited. BC is often interpreted as marker for diesel-
related emissions, and observed associations with CVD events

as PM2.5 may be more important in the association of air pol-
lution with CVD.
The present study has several strengths that merit consid-
eration. First, we studied a racially diverse, community-based 
cohort of individuals not selected based on pre-existing dis-
ease, such as diabetes mellitus or CVD. Hence, the findings are 
applicable to understanding associations between air pollution 
exposures, race, and CVD among broad populations. Second, 
we were able to estimate residence-specific exposures for each 
participant for the year before clinical assessment using a spa-
tial model for air pollution concentrations derived from a large 
number of concentration measures collected across the region. 
Third, the stability of the population in Western Pennsylvania 
was associated with a long residence of this cohort in their 
current homes, which provided a reliable measure of pollution 
exposure over time.
Our study has several limitations. First, it is a single-center 
study, and the range of air pollution concentrations across the 
study participants is somewhat smaller than that observed in 
multicenter studies, such as MESA (Multi-Ethnic Study of 
Atherosclerosis).8,32 The smaller range of exposures may limit our 
ability to detect how differences in pollution affect risk. Second, 
we did not have information on duration of residence of partici-
pants in each location before entry into the study; hence, there 
may be misclassification of long-term exposure status depend-
ing on how long participants lived in a certain location. Third, 
the significant correlation between race, socioeconomic status, 
and exposure to air pollutants makes identifying the individual

effects of these variables challenging in mutually adjusted, mul-
tivariable models in this medium-sized study. Race may be more 
reflective of the social construct of ethnicity rather than underly-
ing biological differences and hence has more likelihood of being 
confounded by social factors, such as education and income.
Of note, we did not assess indoor sources of PM2.5 in 
the present study. Indoor air pollution is a serious concern. 
However, an important portion of indoor pollution is derived 
from outdoors, and these are importantly correlated.33 
Residence-based outdoor pollution exposure estimates, which 
we used in this study, are repeatedly shown to significantly 
predict a wide range of health outcomes in studies world-
wide.5–8 These exposure estimates do not represent the entirety 
of each individual’s pollution exposure but rather reflect the 
persistent contrast in exposures across urban cohorts.
Regarding measurement of dependent variables, we used 
single measurement of the CVD risk factor correlates of the 
environmental pollutants presented in this study. Single mea-
surement of exposure or outcome (compared with repeat mea-
surement) is more likely to lead to random misclassification. 
Such nondifferential misclassification is not likely to cause a 
systematic bias; instead, it weakens any observed association 
between exposure and outcome (regression dilution). Therefore, 
any observed association would be considered valid although it 
may be weaker than the actual underlying relationship. Prior 
studies of environmental exposures have estimated air pollu-
tion over long periods of time (chronic exposures), even where 
a given CVD risk factor is measured at only 1 or a few points in 
time.34,35 This is because pollution is a minor burden that accu-
mulates daily over many years, and many years of exposure can 
often precede any apparent physiological alteration.
In conclusion, we found significant racial differences in 
exposures to urban air pollutants and outcomes in a com-
munity-based cohort in Western Pennsylvania. Exposures to 
PM2.5 were associated with elevated blood glucose, worse 
endothelial function, and incident CVD events and all-cause 
mortality. Compared with whites, blacks had higher rate of 
CVD events and all-cause mortality that was partly explained 
by higher exposure to PM2.5. Further larger-sized, multicenter 
studies can help to better understand the role and mechanisms 
of environmental pollution exposures in racial differences in 
cardiovascular risk and outcomes.

Highlights
• We found black individuals had significantly higher exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (particles with median aerodynamic diameter 
<2.5 µm) compared with whites.
• Exposure to higher concentration of particles with median aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm, was independently associated with elevated blood 
glucose and worse endothelial function.
• Exposure to higher concentration of particles with median aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm was associated with a higher risk of incident car-
diovascular disease events and all-cause mortality combined.
• Black participants, compared with whites, had higher risk of combined incident cardiovascular disease events and all-cause mortality, which 
was in part explained by exposure to higher concentration of particles with median aerodynamic diameter <2.5 µm in blacks.
