Objectives: The introduction of metagenomic sequencing to diagnostic microbiology has been hampered by
slowness, cost and complexity. We explored whether MinION nanopore sequencing could accelerate diagnosis
and resistance profiling, using complicated urinary tract infections as an exemplar.
Methods: Bacterial DNA was enriched from clinical urines (n¼10) and from healthy urines ‘spiked’ with multi-
resistant Escherichia coli (n¼5), then sequenced by MinION. Sequences were analysed using external databases
and bioinformatic pipelines or, ultimately, using integrated real-time analysis applications. Results were com-
pared with Illumina data and resistance phenotypes.
Results: MinION correctly identified pathogens without culture and, among 55 acquired resistance genes
detected in the cultivated bacteria by Illumina sequencing, 51 were found by MinION sequencing directly from
the urines; with three of the four failures in an early run with low genome coverage. Resistance-conferring muta-
tions and allelic variants were not reliably identified.
Conclusions: MinION sequencing comprehensively identified pathogens and acquired resistance genes from
urine in a timeframe similar to PCR (4 h from sample to result). Bioinformatic pipeline optimization is needed
to better detect resistances conferred by point mutations. Metagenomic-sequencing-based diagnosis will enable
clinicians to adjust antimicrobial therapy before the second dose of a typical (i.e. every 8 h) antibiotic.
Introduction
The UK Government’s O′Neill Commission, reviewing the threat of
antibiotic resistance,1 stresses the potential of rapid diagnostics
to improve both treatment and antibiotic stewardship. Reducing
the time needed to obtain a microbiological diagnosis shortens
the duration of broad empirical therapy and its selective pressures.
PCR can detect pathogens and resistance genes in specimens
without culture, but cannot cover the diversity of organisms and
resistance determinants potentially present. Metagenomic
sequencing could deliver this comprehensiveness,2 – 7 but slow
turnaround, cost and complexity have impeded introduction
into clinical microbiology.
Oxford Nanopore Technologies′ (ONT) MinION8 is the first tech-
nology potentially able to deliver sequencing data from clinical
samples in a timeframe allowing early de-escalation and refine-
ment of antimicrobial treatment. We examined its applicability
to investigation of urinary tract infections (UTIs). These account
for over 8 million physician visits per annum in the USA.9 Most
are trivial, but, in severe cases, infection may ascend to the kid-
neys, with overspill to the bloodstream precipitating bacteraemia
and urosepsis. Complicated UTIs are a growing cause of hospital-
ization, mostly of elderly patients,10 and 35676 Escherichia coli
bloodstream infections were recorded in England in 2014–15,11
over 60% with a urinary origin. There is growing resistance, par-
ticularly in severe and bacteraemic infections, to fluoroquino-
lones, cephalosporins and lactamase-inhibitor combinations,
driving use of previously reserved carbapenems, even as ‘empir-
ical’ therapy. With carbapenemases now proliferating, and few
alternative therapies in reserve, escalating empiricism becomes
increasingly untenable, underscoring the desirability of moving
to early targeted therapy, guided by diagnostics.
Materials and methods
Urines
Ten heavily infected (.107 cfu/mL) clinical urines (CU1–10) from patients
at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital (NNUH) were tested.

 Additionally, urine from a healthy volunteer was spiked with 108 cfu/mL of
the MDR E. coli strain H141480453 and with cultivated E. coli from CU6. The
genome sequence of E. coli H141480453 was determined previously
(Illumina HiSeq) at Public Health England (PHE).
Ethics
Ethical approval was not required for the study as testing was performed,
for method development purposes, on excess sample from routine CUs
submitted to the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital clinical micro-
biology laboratory and no patient information was collected.
Sample preparation for MinION Nanopore sequencing
Methodology was refined during the project. In its final iteration, urines (4–
10 mL) were centrifuged at 300 g for 2 min to deplete human cells. The
supernatant was collected and re-centrifuged at 12300 g for 5 min, with
the resulting bacterial pellet resuspended in 1 mL of PBS and processed
with a MolYsis Basic 5 Kit (MolYsis Life Science, Bremen, Germany) to lyse
residual human cells and to remove their DNA. Bacterial Lysis Buffer
(Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and proteinase K (14–22 mg/mL) (Roche) were
added and, after incubation for 10 min at 658C, DNA was purified using the
MagNA Pure Compact Nucleic Acid Isolation Kit (Roche) and DNA Bacteria
v3_2 protocol. Variations, in early iterations, were (i) the initial centrifugation
was omitted and no human DNA depletion performed (CU1), and (ii) a
NEBNextw Microbiome DNA Enrichment kit (New England BioLabs, Hitchin,
UK) was used to remove human DNA instead of MolYsis (CU2–4).
To spike urines, 1 mLof overnight broth culture (109 cfu/mL) was added
to 9 mL of donor urine, which was then processed as above, always using
the final iteration of the method.
The quality and concentration of DNA was assessed using a Qubitw 2.0
Fluorometer (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK) and 2200 TapeStation (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA); concentrations .15 mg/L were considered
acceptable.
MinION library preparation and sequencing
To generate a library with an average fragment size of �8 kb, up to 2 mg of
DNA was fragmented by centrifugation at 7200 rpm (3600 g) in a G-tube
(Covaris, Brighton, UK), used according to the manufacturer’s instructions,
then end-repaired (New England BioLabs), cleaned with Agencourt AMPure
XP Beads (Beckman Coulter, High Wycombe, UK) and dA-tailed (New
England BioLabs). The product was re-cleaned and eluted in 31 mL of
Tris-HCl (pH 8.5).
The library was then prepared according to the SQK-MAP-006 Genomic
Sequencing Kit protocol provided by ONT.12 Variations, in earlier library
preparation experiments, were: (i) Kit SQK-MAP-002 was used for CU1–
413; (ii) Kit SQK-MAP-003 was used with CU5 and 6 and for spiked urine
run 113; (iii) Kit SQK-MAP-004 was used14 for CU7 and urine spiked with
E. coli recovered from CU6; (iv) Kit SQK-MAP-0058 was used with CU8–
10 and spiked urine run 2; and (v) ONT Rapid Sequencing Kit, with a
15 min library preparation procedure, was used, in accordance with the
manufacturer’s instructions, for spiked urine run 4.
MinION sequencing was performed using R7.3 flow cells, except for
CU1–4, where R7.0 cells were used. Sequencing was run for 7.5–48 h
(see Table 1). ONT MinKNOW software (versions 0.45.2.6–2.34.3) was
used to collect raw electronic signal data, which were base-called using
MetrichorTM software.
BLAST and CARD identification of pathogens and
resistance genes using MinION data
Identification of species and resistance genes routinely utilized BLAST
search and the CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database)
database.15 MinION data were extracted, in fasta format, from raw
HDF5 files using Poretools.16 BLAST database aliases were built for proteo-
bacteria, firmicutes and human sequences. Top hits from each of these
separate database aliases were identified. Taxa were distinguished using
the in-house script blast_separate_taxa.pl and taxonomy was assigned
using blast_taxonomy_report.pl17 with some modifications.18
Resistance genes were identified by aligning MinION reads to the CARD
database using LAST, with parameters optimized for low-accuracy long
matches.19–21 Some sequences in CARD contain resistance-gene-flanking
regions, leading to false positive results, therefore putative matches were
verified by visualization in Artemis (Sanger)22,23 and by examination of the
coordinates. Consensus sequences were built upon the CARD database ref-
erence sequences using the MinION read alignments by Samtools 0.1.19,
Samtools mpileup, bcftools, vcfutils.pl and vcf2fq, ultimately generating
indexed Bam files.24,25 BLASTn (BLAST v 2.2.30+) top hits were identified,
using consensus sequences, against the CARD database, seeking .80%
identity over the length of a gene. In addition, reciprocal BLAST best-hits
were identified between the consensus sequences and the CARD data-
base. The resulting output data were parsed and sorted with a final report
generated by a Python script.18
WIMP and ARMA alignment for pathogen identification
and resistance gene detection
The ONT ‘What’s in my pot?’ (WIMP)26 Metrichor application identifies the
uropathogen in real-time, using a reference database and Kraken 11;
along with Metrichor’s Antimicrobial Resistance Mapping Application
(ARMA)27 for real-time detection of antibiotic resistance genes. Both appli-
cations only became available toward the end of the study and were used
for spiked urine run 3 only.
Illumina library preparation
Two methods were used to sequence DNA from the bacteria cultivated
from the urines. At PHE’s Genomic Services Unit, genomic DNA was pre-
pared using a GeneJET Genomic DNA Purification Kit (ThermoFisher,
Cambridge, UK) and sequenced on a HiSeq instrument (Illumina,
Cambridge, UK) in Rapid Run mode.28 The library was prepared using the
Nextera XT DNA Sample Preparation kits (Illumina), following the manu-
facturer’s protocol. At Brunel University, bacterial DNA was quantified
using the Quant-iTTM PicoGreenw dsDNA Kits (Life Technology, Paisley,
UK) and a FLUOstar OPTIMA plate scanner (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg,
Germany) according to the manufacturers′ specifications. DNA (300 ng)
was fragmented using an Episonic system (Epigentek, New York, USA).
Libraries were constructed using the NEBNext Ultra DNA Sample Prep
Master Mix Kit (NEB) using an automated protocol on a Biomek FX instru-
ment (Beckman Coulter). Ligation was performed with Illumina Adapters
(Multiplexing Sample Preparation Oligonucleotide Kit) and ligated libraries
were size-selected using Agencourt AMPure XP Beads (Beckman Coulter).
Samples were sequenced on the 150 bp end Illumina HiSeq 2000
platform.
CARD alignment for resistance gene detection from
cultivated bacteria
The presence of resistance genes in Illumina sequence reads was deter-
mined with ‘Genefinder’, an in-house PHE algorithm that uses bowtie229
to map the reads to a local database of antimicrobial resistance genes,
and Samtools 0.1.1824,25 to generate an mpileup file. The script then
parses the mpileup file to match to reference sequences, based on read
coverage and .90% nucleotide identity over the full length of the
sequence (the lower threshold adopted for MinION was because of higher
expected error rates).

 Phenotypic characterization of uropathogens
Bacteria were grown by standard methodology30 and identified by
MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy (Bruker, Bremen, Germany). MICs were
determined at PHE by BSAC agar dilution, with results categorized using
EUCAST criteria.31
Results
MinION results and performance improvement
Fifteen MinION runs were performed: 10 with CUs, four using urine
spiked with E. coli H141480453 and one spiked with the E. coli
from CU6 (Table 1). Early attempts failed because human DNA
was insufficiently depleted (CU1), flow cells were poor quality
(CU2 and 4) or DNA was degraded (CU3). Improved sample and
library preparation, along with R7.3 flow cells, resolved these
issues (Figure 1). From CU5 onwards, MinION produced 6536–
34330 2-D reads/run, with 2518–22405 ‘pass 2-D reads’, and a
mean read-length of 3452–6076 bp. The longest single read
was 46213 bp, and single-read identity to reference sequences
improved from 70% to 85%. Successive runs for urine spiked
with E. coli H141480453 illustrate the gains (Figure 2); sequence
yield and depth improved from run 1 to 2; WIMP/ARMA software
reduced processing to 7.5 h in run 3; this fell to 4 h in run 4 using
the Rapid Library Preparation Kit, despite having to revert to
BLAST/CARD analysis since WIMP/ARMA could not analyse the
kits 1-D read data.
Bacterial identification
Analysis using BLAST and the CARD database was performed on
2-D ‘pass’ reads for CU5–7 and for all spiked urines (except run
3, using WIMP/AMRA). For CU8–10 we combined 2-D reads from

 ‘pass’ and ‘fail’ folders. In all cases, MinION correctly identified the
pathogen (Table 2); WIMP achieved this within 15 min. Human
DNA accounted for only 1.6%–12.3% of reads, confirming that
depletion was effective. Breadth of coverage was from 82.6% to
100%; depth was least for CU5 (2.71×) and greatest (21.55–
22.84×) for spiked urine run 2 and CU8 (Table 2).
Resistance gene profiles
Acquired resistance genes were readily identified in MinION out-
puts, as illustrated in Figure 3 (CUs) and Table 3 (spiked urines).
Among 55 acquired resistance genes detected by Illumina
sequencing of the cultivated bacteria, 51 were found by MinION
directly from urines; three of four exceptions were with CU5,
where coverage was poorest. Limitations were: (i) MinION often
flagged multiple gene variants, whereas Illumina definitively
identified alleles; (ii) resistance-conferring mutations were not
detected; and (iii) plasmid and chromosomal ampC were not dis-
criminated and nor could the mode of ampC expression be
inferred.
CU5 (Klebsiella pneumoniae)
MinION and Illumina detected blaCTX-M-15 corresponding to the
isolate’s ESBL phenotype. Both also found blaOXA-1, congruent
with amoxicillin/clavulanate resistance. Also in agreement, both
found dfrA14, explaining trimethoprim resistance. Illumina identi-
fied blaLEN-12 and blaSHV-27, whereas MinION indicated blaSHV-32;
these probably all correspond to the chromosomal blaLEN/blaSHV
of K. pneumoniae. Illumina also detected blaTEM-1, which should
not expand resistance in the presence of CTX-M-15. The strain
was resistant to gentamicin and tobramycin, according with
detection, by both MinION and Illumina, of aacC2; both methods
also found aac(6′)-Ib-cr, encoding a tobramycin- and amikacin-
modifying enzyme. The low amikacin MIC (2 mg/L) does not con-
flict with this: EUCAST advocates reporting all isolates with
AAC(6′)-1b as amikacin non-susceptible irrespective of MIC.
Streptomycin resistance agreed with the presence of strA
(detected by both methods) and strB (found only by Illumina).
Both approaches found qnrB and aac(6′)-Ib-cr, according with
low-level ciprofloxacin resistance (MIC, 2 mg/L).
CU6 (E. coli)
MinION and Illumina both found blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1, again
congruent with an ESBL phenotype and amoxicillin/clavulanate
resistance. Both also indicated blaTEM-1. MinION flagged several
acquired ampC genes, whilst Illumina indicated blaCMY-113 and
blaMIR-14, albeit below the 90% threshold. It is likely that all
these ampC calls really corresponded to E. coli chromosomal
ampC, as the cefoxitin MIC for the isolate was only 8 mg/L,
whereas cefoxitin MICs for E. coli with acquired plasmid AmpC
enzymes are mostly .64 mg/L (PHE data on file). MinION and
Illumina both found aacC2 and aac(6′)-Ib-cr, agreeing with genta-
micin and tobramycin resistance and a raised amikacin MIC. Both
detected aadA5, but the organism was susceptible to streptomy-
cin and this gene may not be expressed. Detection of dfrA17 by
MinION and Illumina agreed with trimethoprim resistance.
Double mutations in gyrA and parC, explaining high-level cipro-
floxacin resistance, were detected by Illumina, not MinION.

 CU7 (E. coli)
MinION and Illumina again detected blaCTX-M-15, agreeing with an
ESBL phenotype; blaOXA was absent and the isolate was more sus-
ceptible than those from CU5 and 6 to penicillin-inhibitor combi-
nations. Both methods found blaTEM-1. Phenotypic resistance to
streptomycin agreed with detection of aadA1 and strA/strB
by both methods, and aadA3 by MinION only. An ampC gene
(blaACT-24) was flagged by MinION, not Illumina. As with CU5, how-
ever, a low cefoxitin MIC (4 mg/L) contraindicated plasmid ampC
and the result probably reflected miscalling chromosomal ampC.
The ciprofloxacin MIC (0.25 mg/L) was slightly raised and a single
mutation in gyrA was detected by Illumina only.
CU8 (E. coli) and CU9 (Enterobacter cloacae)
The E. coli from CU8 was resistant to ampicillin, amoxicillin/clavula-
nate and cefoxitin (MICs, 16–64 mg/L), with diminished susceptibil-
ity to cefotaxime (MIC 1 mg/L). Cefotaxime/cloxacillin synergy
implied AmpC, as did the raised cefoxitin MIC (.64 mg/L). MinION
flagged several acquired ampC genes, but these were not confirmed
by Illumina sequencing, meaning that upregulation of chromosomal
ampC is the likeliest explanation. CU9 contained E. cloacae with a
cefotaxime MIC of 2 mg/L, reduced to 0.125 mg/L by cloxacillin,
implying partial derepression of ampC, the commonest mode of
oxyimino-cephalosporin resistance in this species. MinION flagged
multiple acquired ampC genes and Illumina flagged blaACT-24, all
probably reflecting mis-calling of chromosomal Enterobacter
ampC. No other acquired genes were found in either CU8 or 9 in
the isolates, agreeing with their general susceptibility.
CU10 (K. pneumoniae)
MinION and Illumina detected blaCTX-M-15 and blaOXA-1, agreeing
with an ESBL phenotype and amoxicillin/clavulanate resistance.
Both also found blaTEM. MinION additionally flagged multiple
blaSHV variants, whilst Illumina indicated blaSHV-28 and blaLEN-12.
High gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin MICs (8–32 mg/L)
accorded with detection of aacC2 and aac(6′)-Ib-cr by both meth-
ods, with aacA4 additionally flagged by MinION. Resistance to
streptomycin agreed with the detection of strA and strB by both
methods and aadA3 by MinION only. Trimethoprim resistance
accorded with the detection of dfrA14 by both techniques. qnrB
and aac(6′)-Ib-cr were found by both methods, but high-level
ciprofloxacin resistance (.8 mg/L) more likely reflected gyrA
and parC mutations, found only by Illumina.
Spiked urines
E. coli H141480453 had NDM and OXA-181 carbapenemases and
was susceptible only to colistin and tigecycline. Synergy arose
between EDTA and imipenem, reflecting metallo-b-lactamase
inhibition, but not between cephalosporins and clavulanate or
cloxacillin. The four sets of MinION data, directly from urine,
closely matched Illumina sequencing (Table 3). Thus, blaTEM,
blaCTX-M-group-1, blaOXA-48/181, blaNDM and blaCMY b-lactamase were
consistently identified, though with MinION flagging multiple
matches within families, whereas Illumina identified single alleles.
Among aminoglycoside determinants, rmtB was consistently
found by both methods, as were aacC2, aac(6′)-Ib-cr and strA/B;
Illumina found aadA2, aadA3 and aadA5 as did MinION run 3;
MinION runs 1 and 2 flagged only one or two of these (aadA2
and aadA3 are closely related; aadA5 differs considerably). rmtB
alone would confer pan-resistance to aminoglycosides, as
observed. Trimethoprim resistance accorded with dfrA12 and
dfrA17, found by Illumina and three of four MinION runs.
aac(6′)-Ib-cr and qnrS variants were consistently flagged by
MinION and Illumina, but mutations in chromosomal gyrA and
parC (reliably detected by Illumina only) are more likely to explain
observed high-level fluoroquinolone resistance. The organism was
sulphonamide resistant and Illumina detected sul1, while all
MinION runs found both sul1 and sul2; tetracycline resistance
agreed with the detection of tetA by Illumina and in three of four
MinION runs. catB3, congruent with observed chloramphenicol
resistance, was consistently flagged by MinION; Illumina detected
a related gene, but with only 69% identity to catB3, and a novel
variant may be present.
One hour of MinION sequencing delivered 0.2×, 3.75× and
6.96× coverage depth for spiked runs 1, 2 and 3, respectively
(Figure 4). To assess whether this detected resistance genes
adequately, we reanalysed 1 h reads from runs 1 to 3 on ARMA
software and those of run 4 with BLAST/CARD (its 1-D reads
were unsuitable for ARMA). All the acquired resistance genes iden-
tified in runs 2, 3 and 4 were recognizable in the 1 h data, except
for blaCMY in run 2 and strB in run 4. An ampC gene (blaLAT-1), was
additionally identified in run 4. Lower coverage in run 1 precluded
1 h detection of several genes.
MinION sequencing of healthy urine spiked with E. coli from
CU6 detected the same acquired genes as (i) Illumina sequencing
of the isolate, and (ii) MinION sequencing direct from CU6, con-
firming that any bacteria and resistance genes in the urinary
tract of the healthy urine donor did not distort results.
Discussion
Rapid pathogen profiling from clinical specimens, without culture,
could facilitate better treatment and antibiotic stewardship. PCR
diagnostics are under trial for this purpose, but can only seek lim-
ited numbers of targets. Sequencing could deliver a more compre-
hensive picture and we investigated if this was achievable with the
MinION. Urine was taken as an exemplar, with a heavy load of
infecting bacteria, thereby: (i) yielding sufficient DNA for MinION
sequencing; (ii) minimizing the confounding effects of commensal
bacteria and laboratory/reagent contamination on results; and
(iii) ensuring a high bacterial cell/human cell ratio. Hasman
et al.7 previously applied Ion Torrent sequencing to urine, finding
identical resistance genes as in the cultivated pathogens, but,
with a 24 h turnaround, their method only modestly accelerated
conventional workflows.
MinION can identify microorganisms32,33 and MinION sequences
can predict resistances in cultivated bacteria.34,35 Advantages over
other sequencing platforms are: (i) rapid turnaround; (ii) low capital
cost; and (iii) small size. The technology remained under active
development whilst the present studies were undertaken. The man-
ufacturer’s improvements, together with refinements in our sample
preparation, delivered the stepwise gains illustrated in Figure 1. Initial
experiments, without human cell depletion (CU1), led to a large pro-
portion of human reads and correspondingly low bacterial sequence
yield. We therefore sought to enrich bacterial DNA, initially by

 NEBNextw Microbiome DNA Enrichment (CU2–4), which proved
unsatisfactory. From CU5, we combined differential centrifugation,
removing most human cells, with MolYsis technology to lyse residual
human cells and remove their DNA. This allowed us to identify
pathogens, and the same families of acquired resistance genes as
found in pure cultures by Illumina, with good agreement to resist-
ance phenotypes.
Most sequence analysis was post-run, using BLAST search and
CARD database. However, the Metrichor WIMP and ARMA soft-
ware, adopted late in these studies, allowed real-time analysis.
With this approach, adding together times for analysis (1 h),
sequencing (1 h), library preparation (3 h), DNA extraction and
sample transport (2.5 h) suggests a total 7–8 h turnaround,
equating to one dosage interval for a ‘typical’, every 8 h, antibiotic.
Further acceleration is feasible using the 15 min library prepar-
ation kit (as with spiked urine run 4) reducing turnaround to
�4 h (Figure 4). This is similar to PCR methodology and would
inform much earlier de-escalation and refinement of therapy
than now. During the WIMP/ARMA-based analysis �32 Mb of
2-D sequencing data were generated, with almost 7× depth of
coverage after 1 h (57 Mb of 2-D data with 11.37× depth were
available after 2 h). Based on the equation of Lander and
Waterman,36 we calculate that 7× depth covers 99.905% of the
E. coli genome (4.6 Mb), leaving little risk of missing an acquired
resistance gene. Moreover, MinION sequencing error rates are
diminishing rapidly (.90% identity with recent R9 pore
chemistry).37
Although the approach has great potential, challenges remain.
First, we used heavily infected urines (.107 cfu/mL) to deliver
�1 mg DNA required for sequencing, whereas significant bacteri-
uria is defined as .105 cfu/mL. Low-input procedures have been
described and should address this issue38; these reduce the DNA
requirement for nanopore sequencing to 20 ng.
Secondly, we tested one urine sample per flow cell. While this
offers flexibility, it is expensive, with cells costing US$500–900
each. This is balanced (i) if a day’s hospitalization is saved, or (ii)
if expensive antibiotics can be avoided. Alternatively, ONT has
introduced a PCR-free barcoding kit, allowing multiplexing of 12
samples; this would reduce the cost per sample, but would neces-
sitate batching, extending turnaround.
Thirdly, allelic variants were poorly distinguished. In particular,
the MinION-based pipeline: (i) failed to detect mutations asso-
ciated with fluoroquinolone resistance or ampC up-regulation
(likely to have been present, e.g. in the E. coli from CU8 and the
E. cloacae from CU9); (ii) flagged multiple alleles (e.g. of blaTEM,
blaSHV, blaCTX-M, blaNDM), whereas Illumina indicated single types;
and (iii) confused acquired (plasmid-mediated) and endogenous
chromosomal ampC and blaSHV/LEN. Distinguishing blaNDM or
blaCTX-M variants is unimportant, as all alleles have similar resist-
ance implications; however, SNPs determine hydrolytic spectrum
and inhibitor vulnerability within the TEM, SHV and GES families,
thereby determining whether a therapy is appropriate or not. In
the case of AmpC, plasmid types are copiously expressed and
have clear resistance association, whereas the implications of
chromosomal types depends on their level of expression, which
is determined by the promoter sequence in E. coli or by mutation
of regulatory genes (principally ampD) in species with inducible
ampC expression, e.g. E. cloacae. To complicate matters further,
the plasmid-mediated types, which occur across species, are
chromosomal escapes from other species—CMY-2, the common-
est, is from Citrobacter freundii and DHA-1 from Morganella mor-
ganii. There are potential ways to address the challenges of
distinguishing closely related variants and predicting AmpC
expression. SNPs and sequence variants can be called using
MinION data,39 though this is slow. In future, reads aligning to
CARD could be isolated and polished to improve consensus accur-
acy, facilitating precise identification. What is more, long MinION
reads can give context to the position of resistance genes, poten-
tially enabling differentiation between plasmid-borne and
chromosomal ampC genes. Optimally, MinION reads will enable
the assembly of complete plasmids and in some cases, single
reads will cover the full length of a plasmid.
Fourthly, a gene may be present, but fail to cause resistance,
owing to poor expression, silencing or inactivation. MinION and
Illumina found aadA5 in CU6, but the E. coli isolate was streptomy-
cin susceptible. Tyson et al.40 previously noted poorer genotype–
phenotype concordance for streptomycin than for other resis-
tances (81.3% versus 100%).
Lastly, optimizing the cut-off to call only the ‘true positive’
results for resistance genes is challenging. We used 90% identity

 for Illumina and (owing to lower base-calling accuracy) 80% iden-
tity for MinION. This lower cut-off probably explains the larger
number of misidentifications of plasmid ampC by MinION and
the calling of catB3 in E. coli H141480453 by MinION, but not
Illumina. A technical aspect, independent of MinION, was occa-
sional misdetection of resistance genes due to inclusion of flank-
ing regions of integrons in CARD (not shown). This might be
resolved by adjusting cut-offs, but is better addressed by stricter
database curation.
All the CU samples tested in this study were infected with sin-
gle pathogens. Polymicrobial UTIs were not sought; however,
MinION data can identify and differentiate multiple species in
metagenomic samples.41 Multiple strains of the same species
would be harder to distinguish, but all their resistance genes
would be represented in the sequence, whereas conventional cul-
ture would be liable to select randomly and test one of the strains
present.
Given the improvements achieved already, we believe that the
technology can be enhanced to overcome these challenges. If so,
MinION profiling from patients with urosepsis could allow benefi-
cial refinement of antibiotic regimens within the first dosage inter-
val after clinical diagnosis.
