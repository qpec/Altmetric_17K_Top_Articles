Dopaminergicmodulationofspinalcordplasticityhaslongbeenrecognized,butcircuitsaffectedbythissystemandtheprecisereceptor
subtypes involved in this modulation have not been defined. Dopaminergic modulation from the A11 nucleus of the hypothalamus
contributes to plasticity in a model of chronic pain called hyperalgesic priming. Here we tested the hypothesis that the key receptor
subtype mediating this effect is the D5 receptor (D5R). We find that a spinally directed lesion of dopaminergic neurons reverses hyper-
algesic priming in both sexes and that a D1/D5 antagonist transiently inhibits neuropathic pain. We used mice lacking D5Rs (DRD5KO
mice) to show that carrageenan, interleukin 6, as well as BDNF-induced hyperalgesia and priming are reduced specifically in male mice.
These male DRD5KO mice also show reduced formalin pain responses and decreased heat pain. To characterize the subtypes of dorsal
horn neurons engaged by dopamine signaling in the hyperalgesic priming model, we used c-fos labeling. We find that a mixed D1/D5
agonist given spinally to primed mice activates a subset of neurons in lamina III and IV of the dorsal horn that coexpress PAX2, a
transcription factor for GABAergic interneurons. In line with this, we show that gabazine, a GABA-A receptor antagonist, is antihyper-
algesic in primed mice exposed to spinal administration of a D1/D5 agonist. Therefore, the D5R, in males, and the D1R, in females, exert
a powerful influence over spinal cord circuitry in pathological pain likely via modulation of deep dorsal horn GABAergic neurons.

Introduction
Three major descending neuromodulatory systems that include
noradrenergic projections (NE) from the locus ceruleus, sero-
toninergic (5-HT) projections from the nucleus raphe magnus,
and dopaminergic (DA) projections from the hypothalamic A11
nucleus are known to modulate the processing of nociceptive
inputs and circuits in the spinal dorsal horn. Chemical lesions of
these systems can change the response of spinal nociceptive cir-
cuits to inflammation or nerve injury (Ossipov et al., 2010). DA
neurons are known to play a critical role in pain modulation in
several areas of the CNS, including the anterior cingulate cortex
(Lo
´pez-Avila et al., 2004), nucleus accumbens (Chang et al.,
2014), and the spinal cord (Yang et al., 2005; Wei et al., 2009). DA
projections to the spinal cord arise exclusively from the A11 area
of the hypothalamus (Skagerberg and Lindvall, 1985), and these
neurons modulate nociceptive processing via activation of post-
synaptic DA receptors in the dorsal horn (Charbit et al., 2009,
2011; Wei et al., 2009; Taniguchi et al., 2011).
D1-like receptors (D1LR), including D1R and D5R, activate
heterotrimeric proteins containing G�s and are coupled to acti-
vation of adenylyl cyclase, whereas the D2-like subfamily (D2LR,

Significance Statement
Pain is the most prominent reason why people seek medical attention, and chronic pain incidence worldwide has been estimated
to be as high as 33%. This study provides new insight into how descending dopamine controls pathological pain states. Our work
demonstrates that dopaminergic spinal projections are necessary for the maintenance of a chronic pain state in both sexes;
however, D5 receptors seem to play a critical role in males whereas females rely more heavily on D1 receptors, an effect that could
be explained by sexual dimorphisms in receptor expression levels. Collectively, our work provides new insights into how the
dopaminergic system interacts with spinal circuits to promote pain plasticity.

 D2R-D4R)arelinkedtoactivationofG�iandG�oproteins(Neveet
al., 2004; Beaulieu and Gainetdinov, 2011). All five receptors have
been found to be expressed in the dorsal horn and/or DRG neurons
(Dubois et al., 1986; Schambra et al., 1994; Yokoyama et al., 1994;
Levant and McCarson, 2001; Zhao et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2008).
D1R expression is restricted to specific regions from lamina I to II,
whereas D5Rs are widely expressed throughout the dorsal and ven-
tral horn of the spinal cord (www.gensat.org) (Zhu et al., 2008).
Selective ligands for D1Rs and D5Rs have not been described; there-
fore, genetic tools are required to define the open question of the
respective roles of D1Rs and D5Rs in pain signaling.
We have recently shown that D1LRs, but not D2LRs, play an
essential role in hyperalgesic priming (J. Y. Kim et al., 2015) and
that these receptors are likely stimulated by the DA A11 projec-
tion from the hypothalamus in this context. Previous work has
demonstrated that spinal DA receptors contribute to synaptic plas-
ticity wherein D1LR agonism produces LTP of C-fiber-evoked field
potentials (Yang et al., 2005). More recent findings indicate that,
after spinal nerve ligation, D1LR stimulation induces a desensitiza-
tion of spinal � opioid receptors, via the release of met-enkephalin,
leading to a loss of opioid-mediated inhibitory control in the spinal
cord (Aira et al., 2016a). D1LR stimulation in the dorsal horn also
induces phosphorylation of the NMDAR subunit NR1 (Aira et
al., 2016b). Collectively, these studies point to a role of D1LRs in
amplification of pain signaling in the dorsal horn of the spinal
cord, but the receptor subtypes and cell specificity of these effects
have not been delineated. Interestingly, DA neurons can synthe-
size and corelease GABA by using nonconventional GABA-
synthesizing enzymes (J. I. Kim et al., 2015), and striatal DA
synapses are frequently composed of contacts formed between
dopaminergic presynaptic structures and GABAergic postsynap-
tic structures that express neuroligin-2 (Zhou et al., 2013). In-
creased neuroligin-2 expression has been implicated in two
different models of chronic pain (Dolique et al., 2013; J. Y. Kim et
al., 2016), but a link between DA and GABAergic spinal cord
neurons has not been established.
Here we describe a previously unknown role for D5Rs in path-
ological pain. We show that genetic ablation of the D5R reduces
acute pain responses and prevents hyperalgesic priming in male
but not female mice. We also provide evidence of a link between
descending DA neurons and the recruitment of spinal GABAer-
gic neurons in pathological pain. Our work further establishes the
role of DA in modulation of chronic pain via a spinal mechanism
of action with a strong sexual dimorphism.
Materials and Methods
Experimental animals
All procedures that involve the use of animals were approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas
at Dallas and were in accordance with the International Association for
the Study of Pain guidelines. All behavioral studies were conducted using
male or female C57BL/6J mice weighing between 20 and 25 g. Mice were
used in behavioral experiments starting 1 week after arrival at the animal
facility at the University of Texas at Dallas or were bred in that facility.
Animals were housed with a 12 h light/dark cycle and had food and water
available ad libitum.
Dopamine receptor 5 knock-out mice (DRD5KO) and other
genetically modified mice
The dopamine receptor 5 KO (Drd5) was generated as described previ-
ously (Hollon et al., 2002). This strain has a neomycin resistance gene
and a proximal linker containing a stop codon, which were ligated in
reverse orientation into a unique SfiI site within the dopamine receptor 5
gene (Drd5). This disrupts the reading frame within the coding region.
Mice were genotyped upon weaning, and homozygous mutants or wild-
type were identified using 3 sets of primers: D1B1, 5�-ACT CTC TTA
ATC GTC TGG ACC TTG-3�; D1B2, 5�-GGA GGA GAT ACG GCG
GAT CTG AAC-3�; and D1B3, 5�-TGA TCA ACT AGT GCC CGG GCG
GTA-3�. All reactions were performed using RED TaqDNA polymerase
(Sigma-Aldrich) and run on a Bio-Rad thermocycler. The PCR products
were analyzed on a 3% agarose gel with Gel Green and imaged using a
ChemiDoc MP imager. The DRD5KO mice develop normally with no
notable differences from wild-type littermates with respect to appear-
ance, body weight, or home cage behaviors. DAT IREScre animals were
generated as described previously (Ba
¨ckman et al., 2006) and crossed to
ROSA-LSL-tdTomato mice.
Neuronal lesions
Spinal DA lesions were done by injecting 6-OHDA (50 �g) intrathecally
with desipramine (25 mg/kg) given intraperitoneally before the 6-OHDA
injection (Sawynok et al., 1991). Mice were then allowed to recover and
tested at time points indicated in Results. Brains and spinal cords were
then removed to perform histological controls for the lesions.
Behavioral assays and drug administration
In all behavioral experiments described above, experimenters measuring
mechanical withdrawal thresholds or scoring mouse facial expressions
were always blinded to the experimental conditions. Mice were randomized
togroupsfrommultiplecagestoavoidusingmicefromexperimentalgroups
that were cohabitating. Sample size was estimated by performing a power
calculation using G*Power (version 3.1.9.2). With 80% power, an expecta-
tion of d � 2.2 effect size in behavioral experiments, and � set to 0.05, the
sample size required was calculated as n � 5 per group. We therefore
sought to have an n � 6 in all behavioral experiments. SD (set at 0.3) for
the power calculation was based on previously published mechanical
threshold data (Moy et al., 2017). All drugs used in this study are shown
in Table 1.
von Frey testing. Mice were placed individually in transparent acrylic
boxes with wire mesh floors and habituated for 1 h before testing. von
Frey monofilaments (Stoelting) were firmly applied to the plantar sur-
face of each hindpaw for 0.5 s. The up-down method of Dixon (Chaplan
et al., 1994) was used to estimate the withdrawal in grams. To induce
hyperalgesic priming, we injected either 0.1 ng of human recombinant
human interleukin 6 (IL-6; R&D Systems) in 25 �l sterile 0.1 M PBS or 1%
carrageenan (w/v, Sigma-Aldrich) in 25 �l sterile PBS into the left hind-
paw with an intraplantar injection or we administered 0.1 ng human
recombinant BDNF (R&D Systems) in 5 �l sterile PBS intrathecal. We
measured mechanical withdrawal thresholds at 3, 24, 48, and 72 h after
injection. After complete resolution of the initial mechanical or thermal
hypersensitivity, mice were assessed for their mechanical withdrawal
threshold and subsequently injected in the left hindpaw with 100 ng of
prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in 25 �l of sterile PBS. Then, mechanical with-
drawal thresholds were measured at 3 and 24 h. For all intrathecal injec-
tions, drugs were administered in 5 or 10 �l sterile PBS to animals
anesthetized with isoflurane for no longer than 3 min.
Tail immersion test. Mice were handled and habituated to freely enter
into a Plexiglas restrainer. This preliminary step minimizes the effect of
stress-induced analgesia. Each mouse was gently handled for 10 min
every day. On test day, 5 mm of the mouse tail was gently introduced into
a water bath preheated at 48°C. As soon as the mouse withdrew its tail
from the hot water, a chronometer was stopped and the latency time was

 recorded. In the absence of an obvious nociceptive reaction, a cutoff of
15 s was set to prevent tissue damage.
Radiant heat paw-withdrawal, Hargreaves test. Mice were placed on a
glass floor, and a focused beam of high-intensity light was aimed at the
plantar surface of the hindpaw. The intensity of the light was set to 25%
or 30% of maximum (IITC Model 390) with a cutoff value of 20 s. The
latency to withdraw the hindpaw was measured to the nearest 0.1 s. Tests
consisted of three consecutive measures of the paw withdrawal latency,
each trial being separated by at least 15 min. The withdrawal latency was
calculated as a mean of three independent measures for each animal.
Formalin test. Mice were placed into acrylic boxes with wire mesh
floors and habituated for at least 30 min. Following habituation, all mice
were given intraplantar injections of formalin (20 �l, 1% formalin in
saline) into the left hindpaw and placed back into the cylinders. Two
genotype blinded investigators recorded the flinching and licking behav-
ior for 1 min every 5 min for 1 h. The number of flinches and the licking
time were recorded every 5 min for a period of 1 min over 60 min. Data
are expressed as the number of flinches (n), the licking time (in seconds),
as well as the sum of the behaviors. The early phase of the formalin test
was defined as 0–10 min, and the late phase as 10–60 min after injection.
Mouse Grimace Scale. The Mouse Grimace Scale (MGS) was used to
quantify affective aspects of pain in mice (Langford et al., 2010). We
scored the changes in the facial expressions (using the facial action coding
system) 3 and 24 h after intraplantar injection of test compounds.
Carrageenan-induced inflammation. Paw edema was measured using a
caliper before and 3 and 24 h after injection of 1% carrageenan into the
hindpaw. Mechanical withdrawal threshold was measured afterward at 3,
24, 48, and 72 h after injection.
Spared nerve injury-induced neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain was
induced in mice using the spared nerve injury (SNI) surgery model. This
surgery consists of exposing and cutting the common peroneal and tibial
branches of the sciatic nerve leaving the sural nerve intact (Decosterd and
Woolf, 2000). One or 2 weeks after surgery, mechanical sensitivity testing
was repeated to ensure that mechanical hypersensitivity had been pro-
duced. Following this test, groups of SNI mice were treated with test
compounds or lesions at time points indicated in Results.
Rota Rod test. To assess motor coordination, we used the accelerating
Rota Rod. Performance on the Rota Rod (AccuScan Instruments), accel-
erating from 4 to 40 rpm in 300 s, was evaluated for 5 trials per session on
3 consecutive days. A resting time of 180 s was allowed between each trial.
The end of a trial was considered when mice fell off the rod or when they
reached 300 s. Latency to fall was recorded for each trial.
Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) systems. All procedures were con-
ducted in a temperature-controlled room (ambient temperature of 23 �
2°C). Animals were allowed to equilibrate in the room for 1 h before
initiation of the study. Color thermograms of the animal’s hindpaws
were obtained using a FLIR T-Series Thermal Imaging Camera. The
T-Series detector system has a focusable distance of 25 cm minimum.
The imager has a temperature range of �40°C to 650°C with a tempera-
ture indication resolution/sensitivity of 0.04°C. For image acquisition,
animals were allowed to freely move in transparent acrylic boxes with
wire mesh floors. The infrared camera was positioned �30–50 cm away
from the hindpaws, and a thermal image was obtained. Thermogram
analysis was performed using the Windows-based PC application of the
FLIR system. The software provides the ability to view individual pictures
with both hindpaws. For each picture, a straight line was drawn on the
plantar surface of both hindpaws and the mean temperature was re-
corded. At least 3 images were taken per animal, and the average temper-
atures were used for further analysis. The raw temperatures were then
plotted for ipsilateral and contralateral paw for each individual animal.
Perfusion and tissue collection
Mice were anesthetized using a mixture of ketamine (80 mg/kg) and
xylazine (12 mg/kg) and transcardially perfused with 30 ml of 0.1 M PBS,
pH 7.4. Following the PBS perfusion, mice were fixed with 50 ml of fresh
4% PFA. The spinal cord and/or brain were removed and further fixed in
the same fixative overnight at 4°C. Consequently, the tissues were trans-
ferred to a 30% sucrose solution in PBS for 48 h at 4°C. After complete
cryoprotection, the tissues were embedded in OCT (Sakura Finetek) for
sectioning on a cryostat. Transverse lumbar spinal cord sections were cut
at 20 �m, whereas brain sections were cut at 40 �m and stored at �80°C
before immunohistochemical procedures.
Bright-field immunohistochemistry
For DAB immunohistochemistry experiments, mouse spinal cord, free-
floating sections were treated with 3% (v/v) hydrogen peroxide H2O2 in
PBS to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity. Nonspecific antigens
were blocked by incubating sections in PBS containing 10% normal goat
serum and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Sections were
then incubated overnight at 4°C with rabbit anti-c-fos antibody (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology, SC-52, 1/1000). After three washes in PBS with
0.3% Triton X-100, sections were incubated for 2 h in blocking buffer
with biotinylated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Vector Laborato-
ries, 1/500). After 3 � 10 min washes in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100,
sections were incubated in an avidin-biotin-HRP solution (ABC Vectastain
Elite kit; Vector Laboratories) for 1 h at room temperature. Sections were
incubated in TBS, pH 7.5, containing 1 tablet of DAB (SigmaFAST) and 1
tablet of urea hydrogen peroxide. All DAB reactions were stopped by
three rinses in Tris-HCl (0.125 M, pH 7.5) followed with two washes in
PBS. Sections were mounted onto Superfrost slides (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific). After dehydration in increasing concentrations of ethanol, slides
were immersed in xylene and coverslipped with DPX mounting medium
(Electron Microscopy Science, #13510).
Quantification of c-fos-immunoreactive neurons
An outline was drawn around the dorsal horn of the spinal cord for each
section and the lamina delimited according to Watson et al. (2009). The
images were thresholded to eliminate background and converted to bi-
nary masks using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD),
allowing a subsequent automatic detection of the c-fos-positive cells for
which the signal is above threshold. After automatic detection of the
c-fos-positive cells throughout the entire dorsal horn, the number of
immunoreactive cells was then counted per specific lamina. A total of 24
sections were counted per mouse, and 3 mice were used per group for a
total of at least 3000 neurons analyzed per condition.
Immunofluorescence and image acquisition
Tissue sections were washed three times with PBS and permeabilized and
blocked with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS containing 10% normal goat
serum. Following permeabilization and blocking for 1 h at room temper-
ature, primary antibodies were added for overnight incubation at 4°C
(for details of antibodies, see Table 2). Slides were then washed with PBS
3 times and then incubated for 1 h with secondary antibody at room
temperature. Slides were washed with PBS 3 times once the secondary
incubation was completed and then mounted in ProLong Gold mount-
ing media (P36930, Invitrogen). Tissues from all groups were processed
together under identical conditions with the same reagents. Confocal
microscopy images were obtained with an Olympus FluoView 1200
single-photon confocal microscope. All images are presented as z projec-
tions of z stacks. Images were processed using ImageJ.
Colocalization image analysis
Image analysis was performed using an ImageJ plug-in called Just An-
other Colocalization Plugin (JACoP) provided in the review by Bolte and
Cordelie
`res (2006). To determine calretinin, somatostatin, TRPV1, and
PAX2 immunoreactivity in c-fos-positive cells, Li’s intensity correlation
analysis was calculated for regions of interest in images collected from

Intensity correlation analysis computes the sum of (current pixel inten-
sity in channel A � channel A’s mean intensity) � (current pixel inten-
sity in channel B � channel B’s mean intensity) for each region of
interest. Both A channel over B channel and B channel over A channel
intensity correlation are represented.
Chromogenic in situ hybridization and FISH
Brains and spinal cords from adult 8- to 12-week-old mice were rapidly
removed and flash frozen on dry ice. The tissues were then mounted
using OCT mounting medium and kept at �80°C until sectioning. Brain
and spinal cord were cryosectioned to 20 �m thickness and mounted
onto Superfrost slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and allowed to dry at
�20°C for 30 min. The sections were subsequently immersed in
prechilled 10% neutral buffered formalin for 15 min and dehydrated in
increasing concentration of ethanol. After complete drying, each section
was carefully circled using a hydrophobic barrier pen (Immedge pen,
RNAscope, ACDBio) and treated with hydrogen peroxide (RNAscope
2.5HD kit) for 10 min to inactivate endogenous peroxidase activity. After
two washes in RNAscope buffer, the sections were then treated with
Protease Plus for 10 min at 40°C. The D1R (D1R, accession no.
NM_010076.3, 20 bp, target region: 444–1358), D5R (D5R, accession no.
NM_010076.4, 20 bp, target region: 1120–2210), Slc6a3 probes (DAT,
accession no. NM_010020.3, 20 bp, target region: 1486–2525) were
added to the section and incubated at 40°C for 2 h. Afterward, the sec-
tions were washed in the RNAscope wash buffer twice and treated with
the amplification reagent 1 (AMP1) for 30 min. There were a total of 6
amplification reagents (AMP1-AMP6) with alternating washes of 30 and
15 min incubation period. Finally, Fast RED was added, which in the
presence of alkaline phosphatase produces a red precipitate. The sections
were then mounted in an aqueous-based media, Prolong Gold (P36930,
Invitrogen), and visualized using a single-photon confocal microscope.
For each section, the corrected total cell fluorescence (CTCF) was used to
quantify the intensity of the signal. To do so, an outline was drawn
around the dorsal horn of the spinal cord and different areas of the
brains. Using ImageJ, the integrated density, the area, as well as the back-
ground noise were measured and the CTCF calculated as equal to the
Integrated Density � (Area of selected cell � Mean fluorescence of back-
ground readings) (McCloy et al., 2014).
Combined immunofluorescence and in situ hybridization
After the RNAscope protocol slides were blocked for 1 h in 10% normal
goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M PB, DRG slices were incubated
IB4-AlexaFluor-488 overnight, and spinal cords were incubated with
NeuN antibody (Millipore, MAB377). The next day, the slides were in-
cubated with DAPI (1:5000 in blocking solution) and coverslipped with
Prolong Gold and allowed to cure for 24 h before imaging.
All combined ISH/IHC images were acquired using an FV-3000 con-
focal microscope (Olympus) and analyzed in CellSens (Olympus). The
40� confocal z-stack images were taken of L4, L5, L6 DRGs from 5 male
and 5 female naive C57BL/6 mice. For each image, the number of IB4 �
neurons was counted using the raw projection image. The total number
of neurons displaying visible nuclei were quantified by increasing the
background fluorescence (in the 488 channel) using the threshold feature
in CellSens (Price and Flores, 2007). We used the percentage of IB4 � cells
(�35%) as a quality-control indicator for our IHC staining as the
protease-treatment in the RNAscope ISH protocol can lead to antigen
degradation and diminish the quality of the labeling. ISH/IHC colocal-
ization was assessed by counting the number of IB4 � and IB4 � neurons
that showed obvious D1R or D5R mRNA expression within the soma.
D1R or D5R mRNA expression outside of the soma (e.g., fibers or non-
neuronal cells) was not analyzed. The diameter of the D1R or D5R
mRNA-positive neurons was measured by drawing a line across the soma
using the ruler tool in CellSens. The number of D1R and D5R mRNA-
positive cells is shown as the percentage of the total neuronal population.
Data analysis and statistics
All data are represented as mean � SEM. All analysis was done using
GraphPad Prism 6 version 6.0 for Mac OS X. Single comparisons were
performed using Student’s t test, and multiple comparisons were per-
formed using a two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post hoc tests for
across/within group comparisons. The a priori level of significance was
set at 95%. F and p values and adjusted p values for all experiments can be
found in Tables 3–5. The N for each individual experiment is described in
the figure legends.
Results
Dopaminergic neurons are required for BDNF-induced
hyperalgesic priming
We have previously shown that BDNF injection into the spinal
cord of mice (Asiedu et al., 2011; Melemedjian et al., 2013) or the
nucleus caudalis of rats (Burgos-Vega et al., 2016) induces hyper-
algesic priming. In this model, we inject intrathecal BDNF fol-
lowed by PGE2 injection into the hindpaw 7 d later when the
animals have completely recovered from the initial hypersensi-
tivity. In primed mice, the PGE2 injection causes mechanical hy-
persensitivity that lasts for at least 48 h, whereas the injection
promotes only a transient (�1 h) mechanical hypersensitivity in
mice previously treated with vehicle (Asiedu et al., 2011). It has
been previously shown that lesion of descending DA neurons that
originate in A11 blocked the maintenance of priming after IL-6
and carrageenan administration into the hindpaw (J. Y. Kim et
al., 2015), but the role of DA neurons in BDNF priming has not
been established. To determine whether these neurons play a role
in BDNF-induced hyperalgesic priming, we ablated DA neurons
by injecting 6-OHDA (50 �g) intrathecal with systemic injection
of desipramine (25 mg/kg) 7 d after BDNF injection (Fig. 1A) to
create a selective DA lesion (Sawynok et al., 1991). Intrathecal
injection of 6-OHDA after BDNF was sufficient to inhibit subse-
quent priming revealed after PGE2 treatment in males at 3 h
(p � 0.05, vehicle vs 6-OHDA) and 24 h (p � 0.05, vehicle vs
6-OHDA) (Fig. 1B). Moreover, we have previously shown that
ablation of spinal dopaminergic neurons could block the devel-
opment of an affective pain state measured by the MGS (J. Y. Kim
et al., 2015). In mice previously treated with BDNF, we observed
a significant increase in the MGS score at 3 h following PGE2,
whereas a similar effect was not observed in mice treated with
6-OHDA (p � 0.05, vehicle vs 6-OHDA) (Fig. 1C). We also tested
whether the BDNF-induced priming effect was altered by the
6-OHDA lesion in female mice. The effect of PGE2 was strongly
attenuated in female mice with the 6-OHDA lesion at 24 h (p �
0.05, vehicle vs 6-OHDA) (Fig. 1D). As we have previously
shown, intrathecal injection of 0.1 ng of human recombinant
BDNF produced mechanical hypersensitivity that lasts for at least
48 h (3, 24, and 48 h: p � 0.001, vehicle vs BDNF) (Fig. 1E).
Our previous work indicates that stimulation of spinal D1LRs
in mice previously exposed to inflammatory mediators is suffi-
cient to reveal a primed state (J. Y. Kim et al., 2015). We observed
that a spinal injection of the D1LR agonist SKF82958 precipitated
mechanical hypersensitivity in male mice lasting for 24 h in
BDNF-primed animals, whereas naive animals were completely
unaffected (3 h: p � 0.05, vehicle vs BDNF; 24 h: p � 0.05, vehicle
vs BDNF) (Fig. 1F). We observed a similar effect in female mice
where SKF82958 produced a robust mechanical hyperalgesia at
3 h (p � 0.05, vehicle vs BDNF), but the effect did not persist
to 24 h in female mice (p � 0.16, vehicle vs BDNF) (Fig. 1F).
Similarly, intrathecal injection of SCH23390 (3.3 �g), a D1LR
antagonist, was able to block PGE2-induced hyperalgesia in
BDNF-primed male mice at 3 h (p � 0.05, vehicle vs SCH23390)
(Fig. 1G). Likewise, intrathecal injection of SCH23390 at a dose of
3.3 �g (1 h: p � 0.05, 3 h: p � 0.05, vehicle vs SCH23390) or 5 �g
(1 h: p � 0.05, 3 h: p � 0.05, vehicle vs SCH23390) transiently
attenuated neuropathic allodynia compared with vehicle-treated

Megat et al. • D5 Dopaminergic Control of Pain Plasticity
 animals (Fig. 1H). These findings further substantiate a role for
D1LRs in hyperalgesic priming in male and female mice and
implicate this system in neuropathic pain in the SNI model. We
confirmed a reduction of TH-immunoreactive A11 neurons 7 d
after the spinally applied DA toxin, whereas no loss of noradren-
ergic neurons was observed in the locus ceruleus indicating a
selective depletion of DA neurons (Fig. 1I).
We then sought to assess the localization of dopamine trans-
porter (DAT) mRNA expression and the effect of intrathecal
6-OHDA lesions on this DAT mRNA expression. We observed
strong DAT mRNA staining in the substantia nigra as a positive
control (Fig. 2A) and a reduction of DAT mRNA in the spinal
cord of 6-OHDA-treated mice (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, DAT
mRNA was expressed in the superficial dorsal horn where it co-
localized specifically with a neuronal marker NeuN (Fig. 2C).
Also, we observed, in parasagittal sections of the spinal cord, a
very similar pattern of expression between DAT IREScre/ROSA-
LSL-tdTomato and DAT mRNA. In both cases, these neurons are
found at the edge of the dorsal horn, suggesting the existence of
cell bodies in outer lamina with axons that run on the rostrocau-
dal axis as seen with tomato labeling (Fig. 2D). Finally, as previ-
ously described (Koblinger et al., 2014), A11 DA neurons show
little signs of DAT mRNA but are highly immunoreactive for TH
(Fig. 2E). Therefore, intrathecal injection of 6-OHDA eliminates
A11 DA neurons (J. Y. Kim et al., 2015), although we do not
observe signs of DAT mRNA expression in these neurons or their
cell bodies in the adult mouse. We also observe a population of
DAT-positive neurons in the dorsal horn that are eliminated by
the intrathecal 6-OHDA lesion.
DRD5KO mice exhibit thermal hypoalgesia as well as an
attenuation of formalin-induced nocifensive behavior in a
sex-dependent manner
We next sought to clarify whether D1 or D5 receptors contribute
to hyperalgesic priming. D5Rs are strongly expressed in the dor-
sal horn of the spinal cord, suggesting that they may play a key
role in pain, but this question cannot be addressed with pharma-
cological tools and mouse genetic tools have not yet been used to
address this question. Previous findings have demonstrated that
spinal DA receptors can modulate nocifensive behavior in a sex-
dependent manner (Liu et al., 2017), but the receptors involved
in this are also unknown. We therefore sought to thoroughly
phenotype DRD5KO mice in a battery of pain tests.
To test whether male and female DRD5KO mice might re-
spond differently to an acute inflammatory insult, we injected 1%
formalin into the hindpaw and recorded the number of flinches
and licking behavior over 1 h in males (Fig. 3A–D) and females
(Fig. 3E–H). We observed no differences in Phase I of the formalin

 test in males (Fig. 3C) or females (Fig. 3G). Whereas nocifensive
behavior was significantly attenuated during the second phase in
males (Phase II, p � 0.05, WT vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 3D), this effect
was not observed in females (Phase II, p � 0.30, WT vs DRD5KO)
(Fig. 3H). We then measured heat sensitivity using the Har-
greaves and tail flick tests to assess whether lack of D5R expres-
sion could affect thermal sensitivity. The Hargreaves test revealed
a clear increase in the paw-withdrawal latencies in males
DRD5KO mice compared with their WT littermates (p � 0.001,
WT vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 4A). Conversely, no differences were ob-
served between female DRD5KOs and their WT control groups
(p � 0.14, WT vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 4B). In the tail flick test, we
observed that male DRD5KOs have longer withdrawal latencies
than WT mice (p � 0.001, WT vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 4C). Again, no
differences were observed between females DRD5KO compared
with their WT littermates (p � 0.11, WT vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 4D).
Finally, we tested whether these differences in nociceptive reflexes
could be due to motor dysfunction. We found that DRD5KO male
(p�0.60,WTvsDRD5KOposthocanalysisatanygiventimepoint)
(Fig. 4E) and female (p � 0.60, WT vs DRD5KO post hoc analysis at
any given time point) (Fig. 4F) mice showed no differences in the
Rota Rod test compared with WT controls.
Sexual dimorphic contribution of D5Rs to carrageenan and
IL-6-induced hyperalgesic priming
We have previously shown that DA, through its action on D1LRs,
is a critical factor mediating the central plasticity that controls
IL-6 and carrageenan-induced hyperalgesic priming (J. Y. Kim et
al., 2015). We hypothesized that D5Rs may be the crucial receptor
subtype for this effect. Because we observed a sexual dimorphism
in the formalin test and in thermal sensitivity in DRD5KO mice,
we first assessed this hypothesis in male mice. We injected IL-6
(0.1 ng) into the left hindpaw of male DRD5KO mice and re-
corded mechanical sensitivity in the acute phase as well as follow-
ing PGE2 (100 ng) treatment. Our results show that IL-6 induces
a robust mechanical allodynia in male DRD5KO mice as well as in
WTs (p � 0.90, post hoc analysis WT vs DRD5KO for any given
time point) (Fig. 5A). However, PGE2-induced priming is atten-
uated in DRD5KO mice at 3 h (p � 0.05, WT vs DRD5KO) but
not at 24 h (p � 0.058, WT vs DRD5KO) compared with WT
mice (Fig. 5B). Those findings are in agreement with previous
data showing that blocking D1LRs does not affect acute mechan-
ical hypersensitivity in response to IL-6 but attenuates the re-
sponse to PGE2 in the priming phase (J. Y. Kim et al., 2015). The
lack of D5Rs significantly attenuated the development of an af-
fective pain state in male DRD5KO mice at 3 h (p � 0.05, WT vs
DRD5KO) after IL-6 as well as 24 h after PGE2 (p � 0.05, WT vs
DRD5KO) (Fig. 5C,D), corroborating an important role of D5Rs
in hyperalgesic priming induced by IL-6 injection.
We then assessed hyperalgesic priming induced by carra-
geenan, which is a polysaccharide that binds to TLR4, activating
Bcl10 and the NF�B pathway (Bhattacharyya et al., 2011). Carra-
geenan intraplantar injection (1%) induced a robust mechanical
hypersensitivity in WT male mice, whereas this response was
blunted in DRD5KO mice at 24 h (p � 0.01, WT vs DRD5KO)
and 48 h (p � 0.05, WT vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 5E). We did not
observe a significant change in the mechanical threshold in
DRD5KO mice compared with baseline (p � 0.085, BL vs 3 h)
(Fig. 5E). PGE2 injection in primed mice revealed a significant
decrease in priming in male DRD5KO mice at 3 h (p � 0.01, WT
vs D5KO) and 24 h (p � 0.05, WT vs D5KO) after injection
compared with WT mice (Fig. 5F). Consistent with formalin and
thermal sensitivity sexual dimorphisms, no differences were ob-
served in response to carrageenan in female DRD5KO mice (p �
0.16, WT vs D5KO) (Fig. 5G). Although a significant difference
was observed at day 9 after carrageenan between WT and
DRD5KO female mice (D9 point in Fig. 5H: p � 0.05, WT vs
DRD5KO), the amplitude of the hyperalgesic priming, as mea-
sured by subsequent PGE2 injection, was identical in female
DRD5KO and WT mice at 3 (WT: BL vs 3 h: p � 0.001; DRD5KO:
BL vs 3 h: p � 0.0001) and 24 h (WT: BL vs 24 h: p � 0.0001;
DRD5KO: BL vs 24 h: p � 0.0001) (Fig. 5H). Then, to test
whether thermal sensitivity after carrageenan could also be af-
fected in the DRD5KOs, we measured paw-withdrawal latencies
using the Hargreaves test. We observed that carrageenan pro-
duced a robust hypersensitivity in WT and DRD5KO male mice
(p � 0.05 WT: BL vs 3 and 24 h; p � 0.05 DRD5KO: BL vs 3 and
24 h). However, male DRD5KO mice exhibited a reduced ther-
mal sensitivity compared with their WT littermates at baseline

 (p � 0.05, WT vs DRD5KO) and again at 48 h (p � 0.05, WT vs

thermal hyperalgesia in response to PGE2 injection on day 9 after
carrageenan injection. In an identical experiment in female
DRD5KO and the WT mice, we did not see any significant differ-
ences at any time points (Fig. 5K) (p � 0.26, WT vs DRD5KO),
but thermal hypersensitivity to carrageenan injection was present
at 3 and 24 h after injection in both genotypes.
Because we observed decreased mechanical hypersensitivity and
a more rapid resolution of thermal hypersensitivity in DRD5KO
male mice, we assessed the degree of carrageenan-induced inflam-
mation in these mice. Edema measurements revealed no gross

whether carrageenan-induced increases in paw temperature could

cantly increased the average temperature of the ipsilateral paw

as has been previously described (Sanchez et al., 2008). However,

3 h: p � 0.99; at 24 h: p � 0.78) (Fig. 5O).

 gave intrathecal injections of BDNF and evaluated mechanical
sensitivity as well as MGS scores. BDNF induced substantially less
mechanical hypersensitivity in male DRD5KOs at 3 h (p � 0.05,
WT vs D5KO), 48 h (p�0.05,WTvsD5KO),and72h(p�0.001,
WT vs D5KO) compared with their WT littermates (Fig. 6A). There
was also a reduction in the response to PGE2 in BDNF-primed
DRD5KO male mice at 24 h (p � 0.05, WT vs D5KO) (Fig. 6B). In
females, there was no significant difference between DRD5KOs and
their WT littermates at any time points (p � 0.90, WT vs DRD5KO)
(Fig. 6C); and, again, no difference was seen in female mice when
priming was assessed with PGE2 injection (Fig. 6D). In addition to
the differences in mechanical hypersensitivity, BDNF-induced gri-
macing was attenuated at 3 h in male DRD5KO mice (p � 0.05, WT
vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 6E), and a similar effect was observed after PGE2
injection with a significant attenuation of MGS scores at 3 h com-
pared with WT mice (p � 0.05, WT vs DRD5KO) (Fig. 6F). We did
not examine MGS scores in females because no differences were
observed in mechanical hypersensitivity in response to BDNF in
female DRD5KO mice.
Because no selective D1R or D5R agonist is available, we took
advantage of the DRD5KO mice to test whether stimulation of
D1Rs is sufficient to reveal the presence of priming in mice pre-
viously exposed to IL-6, which produces equal acute mechanical
sensitivity in WT and DRD5KO mice. When we spinally injected
SKF82958, a D1LR agonist, in male DRD5KO and WT mice that
had been previously treated with IL-6, we observed a significant
reduction of D1LR-induced mechanical sensitivity at 3 h (p �
0.05, WT vs D5KO) but not 24 h (p � 0.14, WT vs D5KO) (Fig.
6G). D1LR agonist-induced affective pain behavior was signifi-
cantly blunted in male DRD5KO mice at 24 h (p � 0.05, WT vs
D5KO) (Fig. 6H). These findings strongly suggest a preferential
role of D5Rs over D1Rs in neuroplasticity mechanisms underly-
ing hyperalgesic priming in male mice. However, our present
findings clearly demonstrate a sexual dimorphic role of spinal DA

 receptors wherein D5Rs have no apparent effect in female mice.
Our previous study showed that spinal injection of a D1LR an-
tagonist SCH23390 reversed hyperalgesic priming in male and
female WT mice (J. Y. Kim et al., 2015). We hypothesized that
female mice may rely more on spinal D1Rs instead of D5Rs in
hyperalgesic priming. To test this, we gave carrageenan-primed
female DRD5KO mice (Fig. 6I) intrathecal injections of SCH23390, a
D1LR antagonist, or vehicle. The D1LR antagonist blocked PGE2
induced mechanical hypersensitivity in primed, female DRD5KO
mice at 3 h (p � 0.05, WT vs D5KO) but not at 24 h (p � 0.063,
WT vs D5KO) (Fig. 6J), suggesting that D1Rs contribute to hy-
peralgesic priming in female mice.
D1R and D5R mRNAs are highly expressed in lumbar DRGs
as well as in lamina III of the spinal cord
D1Rs are among the most abundant receptors expressed in the
brain, especially in the basal ganglia, the amygdala, and layer 6 of
the cortex (Weiner et al., 1991). On the other hand, D5Rs are
restricted to specific subregions, such as CA1 of the hippocampus
and some nuclei in the hypothalamus (www.gensat.org). Because
D1R and D5R mRNAs share �80% sequence homology within
their highly conserved seven transmembrane spanning domains
and display 50% overall homology at the amino acid level (Sidhu,
1998), we tested whether the in situ probes we used were able to
selectively recognize either subtype of receptor mRNA without
cross-reactivity. We found high levels of D1R mRNA expression
in the caudate, whereas D5R mRNA was expressed at a signifi-
cantly lower level (caudate: p � 0.05 D1R vs D5R) (Fig. 7A,B).
Conversely, D5R mRNA was highly enriched in CA1 hippocampus
as shown previously (Sarin
˜ana and Tonegawa, 2016), whereas D1R
mRNA was not detected (CA1: p � 0.01, D1R vs D5R) (Fig. 7A,B).
We then sought to investigate whether there was a difference in the
level of expression of D1R and D5R between males and females and
where these receptor mRNAs were expressed in the adult dorsal
horn of the spinal cord. CTCF was used to quantify the intensity of
the signal (McCloy et al., 2014). We found that the level of D1R
(D1R:p�0.05,malesvsfemales)andD5R(D5R:p�0.05,malesvs
females) mRNA was significantly higher in male mice compared
with females (Fig. 7C,D). We then tested whether D1R and D5R
mRNAs could be differentially expressed in specific lamina of the
spinal cord. Our findings indicate that, in males and females, D1R
andD5RmRNAisprimarilyenrichedinlaminaIIIofthespinalcord
(Fig. 7E), a region that is populated by a large number of GABAergic
interneurons.
Given that we observed some differences in acute pain sensi-
tivity in male DRD5KO mice, we also assessed D1R and D5R
mRNA expression in the DRG. Both D1R and D5R mRNAs were
found in DRG neurons (Fig. 8A). Interestingly, the overall ex-

 pression level for D5R was reduced in female compared with male
mice (D5R: p � 0.01, males vs females), whereas D1R mRNA
expression was equal between sexes (D1R: p � 0.82, males vs
females) (Fig. 8B). In male and female mice, D1R and D5R
mRNA expression was mostly found in small-diameter neurons
with some enrichment seen in IB4 � neurons, suggesting a high
level of expression in nonpeptidergic C-fibers (Fig. 8C). The de-
creased expression of D5R mRNA found in female mice was
largely accounted for by decreased expression in small-diameter,
IB4-negative nociceptors that are mostly of the peptidergic class
(Fig. 8D). This finding is consistent with the observed difference
in baseline heat sensitivity between male and female DRD5KO
mice being explained by differences in expression in the peptider-
gic population (Mogil et al., 2005).
D1RLR agonist induces c-fos expression in GABAergic
neurons located in lamina III of the spinal cord of
BDNF-primed mice
Our previous findings show that, although GABA-AR agonists
and positive allosteric modulators reduce mechanical hypersen-
sitivity to an acute injury, they fail to do so in animals with
BDNF-induced hyperalgesic priming. In contrast, GABA-AR an-
tagonism promotes antinociception and a reduction in facial gri-
macing in primed mice (J. Y. Kim et al., 2016). We used c-fos

 expression as an indirect marker of neuronal activity to identify
whether a specific subset of dorsal horn neurons could be acti-
vated following D1LR agonist treatment in primed mice. We
observed a significant increase of c-fos-positive neurons in lam-
ina III and IV in male BDNF-primed mice treated with a D1LR
agonist (p � 0.001, BDNF vs vehicle) (Fig. 9A,B), but there were
no changes in other areas of the spinal cord. Laminae I-III of the
spinal dorsal horn contain many inhibitory interneurons that use
GABA and/or glycine as a neurotransmitter. Quantitative studies
in the rat have shown that inhibitory interneurons account for
25%–40% of all neurons in this region (Todd, 2010). The lamina
III and IV induction of c-fos by the D1LR agonist in BDNF-
primed mice is consistent with our observation of strong D1R
and D5R mRNA expression in this lamina of the dorsal horn. To
test whether D1LR agonist-induced mechanical hypersensitivity
in primed mice could be dependent on the GABAergic system, we
first spinally injected the GABA-AR antagonist gabazine in naive
animals and observed a strong mechanical hypersensitivity at 3 h
(p � 0.01, vehicle vs gabazine) (Fig. 9C). In contrast, we observed
that an acute intrathecal injection of gabazine was able to block
D1LR agonist-induced mechanical hypersensitivity at 3 h (p �
0.001, vehicle vs gabazine) in BDNF-primed mice (Fig. 9D). This
suggests that DA and GABAergic function are linked in the pro-
duction of mechanical hypersensitivity specifically in primed
mice. Inhibitory interneurons are found throughout the dorsal
horn but are enriched in specific lamina, such as lamina II and III,
where they coexpress an increasing well-understood number of
marker peptides or calcium-binding proteins (Peirs and Seal,
2016). Somatostatin is a neuropeptide in inhibitory interneurons
from lamina I to lamina III (Polga
´r et al., 2013), calretinin is
calcium-binding protein that is mainly expressed in lamina II
interneurons (Peirs et al., 2015), and PAX2 is a transcription
factor expressed exclusively by GABAergic interneurons
(Larsson, 2017). We used all of these markers, along with TRPV1
as a marker of peptidergic afferent endings, to gain insight into
the dorsal horn neurons that express c-fos in primed animals
stimulated with a D1LR agonist. Our findings show that 45% of
the c-fos-positive neurons are located in lamina innervated by
TRPV1 afferents (Fig. 9E), indicating that a significant propor-
tion of c-fos-positive neurons receive inputs from peptidergic
neurons. A total of 22% of the c-fos-positive neurons express
calretinin in lamina II (Fig. 9F), 27% express somatostatin (Fig.
9G), and 30% express PAX2 in lamina II–III (Fig. 9H). These
findings indicate that many of the c-fos-positive neurons stimu-
lated in primed animals are likely GABAergic neurons, but a
substantial portion cannot be clearly identified by these estab-
lished markers.
Discussion
Our work supports the following primary conclusions: (1) spinal
DA projections play a critical role in BDNF-induced and other
forms of hyperalgesic priming in male and female mice; (2) male,
but not female, DRD5KO mice display decreased basal heat sen-
sitivity and decreased responsiveness to irritant injection but
have normal mechanical sensitivity; (3) spinal D5Rs play a key
role in IL-6, BDNF, and carrageenan-induced hyperalgesic prim-
ing in male, but not female, mice; (4) D5R mRNA expression is
higher in male than female mice in the spinal cord and DRG and
is enriched in lamina III and IV neurons of the spinal cord; and
(5) analysis of neurons activated by D1LRs in primed mice sug-
gests engagement of a deep dorsal horn neuron circuit that in-
cludes GABAergic neurons. Collectively, our experiments further
substantiate DA as a key regulator of spinal nociceptive plasticity,
especially as pain becomes chronic, and indicate a novel role for
D5Rs in pain with a surprisingly profound sexual dimorphism in
mice.
The diencephalic A11 system provides the only known DA
innervation of the spinal cord and has been implicated in pain
modulation (Charbit et al., 2009; J. Y. Kim et al., 2015), spinal
locomotor networks (Sharples et al., 2014), and restless legs syn-
drome (Clemens et al., 2006). Two recent studies have shed light
on the diversity of neurons in the hypothalamus that project to
the spinal cord; albeit the studies were performed in different
species. A study in rat described three types of hypothalamospinal
neurons, each having a specific neurochemical profile, which
may suggest distinct functional roles in different sensory or mo-
tor modalities (Ozawa et al., 2017). As an example of this, a recent
study in zebrafish identified the posterior tubercular DA system
as an evolutionarily ancient, sensory-driven system in which an-
atomically and neurochemically distinct subpopulations are or-
ganized according to sensory stimuli modalities, and specific
subgroups of these DA neurons regulate their activity levels ac-
cording to sensory stimulus intensities (Reinig et al., 2017). An-
other interesting feature of A11 DA neurons is that previous
investigations have not detected DAT or aromatic amino acid
decarboxylase mRNAs in A11 (Koblinger et al., 2014), suggesting
that A11 DA neurons may actually release L-Dopa rather than DA
(Barraud et al., 2010). However, our current data, our previous
findings (J. Y. Kim et al., 2015), and the work of other groups
demonstrate that intrathecal 6-OHDA lesions A11 neurons and
decreases DA levels in the spinal cord (Zhao et al., 2007). We
observed DAT mRNA in the spinal cord. Some of this mRNA is
likely contributed by a population of intrinsic dorsal horn neu-
rons that express DAT, but some may also be contributed by DAT
mRNA found in the terminals of projection neurons from the
A11. This possibility could explain the lesion of these neurons by
spinal 6-OHDA.
The above-mentioned issues about the neurochemical pheno-
type of A11 neurons that project to the spinal cord aside, our
findings show that a spinally directed DA lesion reverses the pres-
ence of hyperalgesic priming across a broad variety of priming
stimuli (J. Y. Kim et al., 2015) in male and female mice, and
blockade of D1LRs leads to transient inhibition of neuropathic
allodynia in the SNI model of neuropathic pain. This latter effect
is consistent with previous findings showing that an inhibition of
A11 neurons using a local infusion of a D2LR agonist completely
blocked mechanical hypersensitivity in the rat spinal nerve liga-
tion model (Wei et al., 2009). It is also aligned with other studies
showing a strong A11 projection to the medullary dorsal horn
(Abdallah et al., 2013) wherein inactivation of A11 neurons using
local infusion of a GABA-AR agonist or lesioning A11 neurons
inhibits trigeminal pain behavior (Abdallah et al., 2015). While
our data, as well as these previous studies, provide strong support
for A11 DA neurons in a pronociceptive role in pain modulation,
our work also raises the possibility that an intrinsic population of
neurons that express DAT mRNA may play a previously unrec-
ognized role in spinal nociceptive circuitry. It will be interesting
to use modern genetic tools to study both of these populations of
neurons.
A primary goal of the experiments described here was to test
the hypothesis that D5Rs play a critical role in pain modulation.
Our previous findings indicate a critical function for D1LR re-
ceptors in plasticity underlying hyperalgesic priming (J. Y. Kim et
al., 2015), and it is well known that DA plays a key role in mod-
ulation of synaptic plasticity throughout the CNS, primarily
through a postsynaptic action on D1LR receptors (Hansen and

Megat et al. • D5 Dopaminergic Control of Pain Plasticity
 Manahan-Vaughan, 2014). However, few studies have attempted
to delineate between the contributions of D1Rs and D5Rs to these
effects, and no studies in the pain field have done this. In testing
our primary hypothesis, we found a strong role for D5Rs in pain
modulation in the spinal cord and DRG with a surprisingly pro-
found sex difference. For instance, we found that male, but not
female, DRD5KO mice show decreased noxious heat sensitivity.
Previous studies show that D1R and D5R are both expressed in
peripheral nociceptors (Xie et al., 1998) as well as in the dorsal
horn of the spinal cord (Zhu et al., 2007). Indeed, it has been
shown that activation of D1LRs leads to trans-activation of
TRPV1 (Lee et al., 2015), whereas another study demonstrated
sensitization of TRPV1 (Chakraborty et al., 2016). Given our
current findings, it is highly likely that this effect is actually me-
diated by the D5R and likely occurs specifically in males. This is
consistent with our observation that D5R mRNA is more highly
expressed in peptidergic neurons in males than females because
these neurons are known to mediate heat sensitivity in mice.
Interestingly, mice deficient for the D3R, a G�i coupled-receptor,
exhibit thermal hypersensitivity (Keeler et al., 2012) in a sex-
dependent manner (Liu et al., 2017), suggesting that DA plays a
critical role in setting noxious heat sensitivity.
We also found a sexually dimorphic effect of D5Rs in the
spinal cord. We observed deficits in hyperalgesic priming specif-
ically in male DRD5KO mice and an increased level of D5R ex-
pression in male versus female mice. A very recent study also
observed a sexual dimorphism in D1R and D2R expression in the
frontal cortex of young rats (Orendain-Jaime et al., 2016), sug-
gesting that sex differences in the DA receptor system may be
found throughout the CNS. Although there is a sexual dimor-
phism in the role of the D5R in our observations, we emphasize
that D1Rs appear to fulfill the role that D5Rs assume in male mice
when similar experiments are conducted in female mice. There-
fore, the spinal DA system plays a critical role in pain modulation
in both sexes, but the receptor dependence of this effect varies by
sex of the mouse. It remains to be seen whether this effect is
conserved in other species.
The current study shows that primed animals exhibit a specific
pattern of c-fos expression when treated with a D1LR agonist and
many of these neurons are found in the deep dorsal horn (lamina
III-IV). This overlaps with the mRNA expression pattern for D1R
and D5R and suggests that many of those c-fos-positive neurons
might express one or both of those receptors. Technical limita-
tions of the in situ hybridization approach prohibited us from
examining overlap of the mRNAs for these receptors with c-fos
staining. Nevertheless, we show that c-fos-positive neurons coex-
press a variety of markers, including the calcium binding protein,
calretinin, which is expressed by excitatory or inhibitory in-
terneurons (Smith et al., 2016), and 30% of the c-fos-positive
neurons coexpress PAX2, a transcription factor known to be ex-
pressed exclusively in GABAergic interneurons in the murine
spinal cord (Larsson, 2017). Hence, our findings point to an im-
portant modulation of deep dorsal horn GABAergic interneu-
rons by DA in primed mice. This conclusion is supported by
our behavioral observation that spinal GABA-AR antagonism in
primed animals induced antinociception, at a dose that is prono-
ciceptive in nonprimed animals.
How might DA neurons be linked to GABAergic neurons in the
deep dorsal horn? Neuroligin 2 is a synaptic adhesion molecule
thought to be exclusively expressed within inhibitory synapses
(Varoqueaux et al., 2004). However, recent findings reported that
dopamine synapses are neurochemically mismatched contacts con-
taining neuroligin 2 formed between dopaminergic presynaptic and
GABAergic postsynaptic neurons (Uchigashima et al., 2016). In-
terestingly, neuroligin 2 expressed at the GABAergic postsynaptic
structure controls striatal synapse formation by giving competitive
advantage to heterologous dopamine synapses over conventional
GABAergicsynapses.Wepreviouslyshowedthathyperalgesicprim-
ing drives an increase in neuroligin 2 expression in the spinal cord
and that the behavioral maintenance of hyperalgesic priming
can be completely reversed by an intrathecal injection of a
neuroligin-2 inhibitory peptide (J. Y. Kim et al., 2016). We there-
fore speculate that the increase in neuroligin 2 expression in the
spinal cord that is linked to chronic pain may drive the formation
of neurochemically mismatched synapses that create a patholog-
ical link between two neurotransmitter systems in the deep dorsal
horn.
