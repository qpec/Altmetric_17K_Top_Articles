Abstract
Background: The disease modifying potential of osteoarthritis therapies are of increasing interest, including their
effects on delaying total knee replacement (TKR). To date, there have been no studies to determine the effect of
LMWF-5A, a novel anti-inflammatory compound derived from human serum albumin, on delaying TKR.
Methods: We evaluated time to TKR three years after patients participated in a randomized trial of three intra-
articular injections of LMWF-5A or saline. Patients were contacted via last known phone number and were asked to
participate in a short nine item telephone questionnaire; verbal consent was obtained. The primary endpoint was
incidence of TKR (%).
Results: In total, 39 of 45 patients responded (87% response rate). The overall incidence of TKR was 38.5% (15/39).
TKR rates were higher in patients with more severe osteoarthritis defined by Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4, compared
to patients with moderate osteoarthritis defined by Kellgren-Lawrence grade 3 (56% vs. 26%, p = 0.06). Overall, there
were no differences in TKR rates by treatment arm (39% LMWF-5A vs. 38% saline, p = 0.92). In the severe osteoarthritis
subset (n = 16), treatment with LMWF-5A resulted in a lower incidence of TKR compared to saline vehicle arm
(40% vs. 83%, p = 0.15). TKR rates were significantly lower with LMWF-5A in patients who responded to treatment
(14% with LMWF-5A, vs. 100% with saline, p = 0.03).
Conclusion: This study demonstrates significant delays in TKR for patients with severe osteoarthritis treated with
LMWF-5A, suggesting that LMWF-5A has the potential to provide structure modifying/preserving therapy in this
population.

Background
Osteoarthritis is a painful, chronic, degenerative, and
incurable inflammatory disease. Nearly half of all adults
will develop symptomatic osteoarthritis of the knee
(OAK) during their lifetime [1]. The course of OAK is
progressive to more severe disease, characterized by
cartilage loss and increasingly severe clinical manifesta-
tions over time [2, 3]. Progression to the most severe
form of OAK, defined by Kellgren-Lawrence grade 4
severity (0–4 scale) [4], leaves patients with few treatment
options other than surgical interventions including total
knee replacement (TKR) surgery. The rate of TKR is
anticipated to increase rapidly to over 3.5 million procedures
in the U.S. by 2030 [5].
Current osteoarthritis treatments target symptomatic
short-term outcomes including pain and function. How-
ever, OAK therapies have potential to be disease modifying,

 including the reduction of cartilage loss and the delay
of TKR. Whether OAK therapies can delay TKR is of
increasing interest to clinicians, patients, and researchers
alike. Very few studies have examined time to TKR or
rates of TKR as an outcome parameter, including only
three randomized controlled trials (RCTs) [6–8].
LMWF-5A is a novel, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory
compound consisting of the < 5 kilodalton (kDa) ultrafil-
trate of 5% human serum albumin (HSA). LMWF-5A is
currently in development to provide relief for severe
OAK. LMWF-5A has been shown to effectively reduce
pain in patients with OAK when administered as an
intra-articular injection [9–11]. There have been no
in vivo studies determining the effects of LMWF-5A on
delaying TKR. In vitro studies suggest aspects of the
mechanism of action of LMWF-5A support disease
modification [12–15].
The objective of this study was to determine the effect
of LMWF-5A on delaying TKR during long-term (three
year) follow up of patients participating in a clinical trial
evaluating
LMWF-5A
for
the
treatment
of
OAK
(AP-007-A) [11].
Methods
Patients were recruited from the population who partici-
pated in the prior clinical trial (AP-007-A). Detailed
methods and results of that trial have previously been
published [11]. In brief, patients with symptomatic OAK
were enrolled between August 1, 2014 and October 19,
2014, with follow-up through October 12, 2015. Patients
were randomized 1:1 to three 4 mL intra-articular injec-
tions (baseline, week 2, week 4) of either LMWF-5A or
saline vehicle control and followed to 20 weeks (primary
endpoint), with an exploratory endpoint at 52 weeks to
quantitatively measure cartilage thickness change by
magnetic
resonance
imaging
(MRI).
As
reported,
LMWF-5A resulted in a significant reduction in pain at
20 weeks compared to saline (64% vs. 40% reduction).
In this IRB-approved follow-up study, patients were
followed three years (minimum: 3.1, maximum: 3.3) after
treatment with LWMF-5A or saline. Two patients were
excluded for mild severity OAK (KL grade 2); the
remaining 45 patients were contacted via last known
phone number and were asked to participate in a
telephone questionnaire. A maximum of three follow-up
phone calls were attempted.
During the telephone call, research staff first obtained
verbal informed consent and then asked patients a total
of a nine questions. The survey included questions
asking the patient whether they have received a TKR
(q1), time to TKR (q2), reasons for having/not having
TKR (q3), past history of analgesic therapies for treating
OAK (q4–7), satisfaction with TKR (q8), and overall pa-
tient global assessment of disease severity (PGA; q9).
Following completion of the study, a copy of the consent
form and a $25 gift card was mailed to all consenting
patients.
All analyses were performed using SAS 9.3 or later
(SAS Institute; Cary, NC). There was no imputation of
missing data. Results are presented for all subjects and
the subset with severe OAK (KL grade 4). Patients that
responded to treatment were also examined, where
response to treatment was defined as a 20% (0.5-point)
reduction in pain between baseline and week 20 for the
primary endpoint of Western Ontario and McMaster
Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) pain on the
5-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used for
all survey questions. The primary endpoint of incidence
of TKR (%) was examined with Fisher’s exact tests. The
secondary endpoint of time to TKR was examined with
Kaplan-Meier survival curves.
Results
In total, 39 of 45 patients responded (87% response rate);
the remaining patients were unreachable. The response
rate was similar with LMWF-5A (23/25, 92%) and saline
(16/20, 80%). The average time to follow-up was 3.2 years
(min: 3.1, max: 3.3 years).
Survey responses
The overall rate of TKR was 38.5% (15/39). The primary
reasons for having TKR were (open-ended): severe
osteoarthritis “bone-on-bone” with severe pain (n = 6,
40%), severe pain (n = 4, 27%), unable to perform
activities of daily living (n = 3, 20%), no relief from
intra-articular injections (n = 2, 13%). Reasons patients
did not have TKR included: absence of significant pain/
mobility limitations (n = 13, 54%), currently receiving
effective treatment (n = 6, 25%), it is contraindicated/not
recommended (n = 1), fear of operation or its effectiveness
(n = 1), fear of losing disability insurance (n = 1), I do not
need it yet/TKR is a “last resort” (n = 1), and currently
scheduled for TKR (n = 1).
In patients who had TKR, 40% (n = 6) were receiving
knee injections at least a few times each year to treat
osteoarthritis, prior to surgery. Among patients who had
not had TKR, a similar proportion of patients (37.5%,
n = 9) reported receiving knee injections, a few times
per year (n = 5) or less than yearly (n = 4).
The majority of responses to the PGA, an overall
patient global assessment of disease severity, were very
well or well (77%). PGA responses were more favorable
in patients who did not have TKR vs. patients with TKR
(83% vs. 67% responded very well or well). Still, the
majority of patients were satisfied with TKR (87% very
satisfied or satisfied).

 Incidence of TKR
Fifteen (39%) patients received TKR on average of
21 months (SD: 13) after the trial commenced. TKR
rates were higher in more severe osteoarthritis (KL4:
9/16, 56% vs. KL3: 6/23, 26%, p = 0.06). Patients with
more severe osteoarthritis also appeared to have TKR
more expeditiously (Fig. 1a). TKR rates were similar for
responders (10/29, 34%) compared to non-responders
(5/10, 50%), p = 0.463. There were no differences in
the timing of TKR by responder status (Fig. 1b).
Overall, there were no differences in TKR rates by
treatment arm (LMWF-5A: 9/23, 39% vs. saline: 6/16,
38%,
p = 0.92).
In
the
severe
KL4
subset
(n = 16),
treatment with LMWF-5A resulted in a lower rate of TKR
compared to saline (40% (4/10) vs. 83% (5/6), p = 0.15).
Patients treated with LMWF-5A also had a longer delay
to TKR than saline (Fig. 1c). In patients who responded to
treatment during the AP-007-A trial (≥20% reduction in
pain),
TKR
rates
were
significantly
lower
in
the
LMWF-5A arm compared to the saline (14% (1/7) vs.
100% (3/3), p = 0.03), with longer delays to TKR (Fig. 1d).
Discussion
The results of this study are the first to determine the effect
of LMWF-5A on delaying TKR. The primary findings sug-
gest treatment with LMWF-5A results in significant delay in
TKR for patients with severe OAK. This result agrees with
previous findings that the treatment effect of LMWF-5A is
greatest in patients with more severe disease [9, 10].
Federal
Drug
Administration
(FDA)
guidelines
propose
that
trials
designed
to
evaluate
delays
in
structural progression measure joint space narrowing
[16]. Time to TKR may also be an acceptable outcome.
Most
studies
examining
time
to
TKR
have
been
retrospective case series. There have only been three
RCTs to examine time to TKR in patients with OAK.
Raynauld et al. performed a post hoc follow-up four years
after a twelve month RCT, with an 81% response rate
among 57 patients; the rate of TKR was non-significantly
lower in patients randomized to chondroitin sulfate vs.
saline control (31% vs. 69%) [8]. Bruyere et al. evaluated
patients participating in two previous RCTs who received
at least one year of glucosamine sulphate (response rate
81%); the rate of TKR was significantly lower with
glucosamine sulphate compared to placebo (6.3% vs. 14.5%)
[6]. Blanco et al. examined time to TKR among 52 patients
with severe OAK randomized 1:1 to hyaluronic acid or
saline; the rate of TKR was non-significantly lower with
hyaluronic acid compared to saline (64% vs. 87%) [7].
Only the Blanco study excluded lower severity OAK;
compared to that study, our rate of TKR was similar for
saline arms (87% and 83%, respectively), with a lower
rate of TKR with LMWF-5A than hyaluronic acid (40%
and 64%, respectively).

 The findings from this study support the MRI analysis
of study AP-007-A that demonstrated potential cartilage
preservation
with
LMWF-5A
compared
to
saline,
representing potential for disease modification. There
were 37 patients with MRI data at baseline and at week
52, including 20 patients with medial (n = 10) or lateral
disease (n = 10) and the remaining (n = 17) with either no
denudement or symmetrical disease. Patients treated with
LMWF-5A had less cartilage thickness loss than patients
treated with saline in all 6 pre-specified anatomically
defined medial sub regions (medial disease), and in 5 of 6
lateral sub regions (lateral disease). LMWF-5A also showed
increased cartilage thickness in 2 lateral sub regions.
There are limitations. First, this was a post hoc analysis
that was not powered to detect differences in TKR rates
between treatment groups. A prospective RCT with
incidence of TKR as the primary outcome would need to
be conducted to confirm these findings. Second, not all
patients were reachable; 6 patients had disconnected
phone numbers. Third, respondents were asked “Have
you had a total knee replacement in your study knee?”. It
is possible that subjects with a partial knee replacement
might
have
responded
negatively.
Lastly,
there
are
multiple factors that may have influenced the decision to
have TKR, including current use of other pharmacologic
interventions.
We
collected
information
on
use
of
intra-articular injections and they were reported in a
similar occurrence in the TKR group (prior to surgery)
and the non-TKR group (40% vs. 37.5%), but there
remains the risk of recall bias.
Conclusion
This study demonstrated delays to TKR among patients
with
severe
osteoarthritis
treated
with
LMWF-5A
compared to saline, while showing no differences in
patients with moderate osteoarthritis. These results
support the in vitro work suggesting the effect of
LMWF-5A is demonstrated with severe disease, and has
the potential to provide structure modifying/preserving
therapy in this population.
