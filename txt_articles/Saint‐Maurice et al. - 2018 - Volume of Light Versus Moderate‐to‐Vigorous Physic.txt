Similar Benefits for All-Cause Mortality?
Pedro F. Saint-Maurice, PhD; Richard P. Troiano, PhD; David Berrigan, PhD; William E. Kraus, MD; Charles E. Matthews, PhD
Background-—It is unclear whether the greater benefits of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (PA) over light PA are attributed
to the higher-intensity PA or simply the greater volume of PA accumulated per unit time for moderate-to-vigorous PA. We examined
this question using estimates of the volume of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA in relation to all-cause mortality.
Methods and Results-—We used National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2006 accelerometer records in adults
(≥40 years; n=4840) and mortality data collected through 2011 (n=700 deaths). We estimated intensity-specific PA volume using
activity counts (AC) accumulated in light (100–759 AC/min), moderate-to-vigorous PA (≥760 AC/min), and total PA (≥100 AC/
min). We examined quartiles of each exposure using Cox proportional hazard models (hazard ratios [95% confidence interval)
adjusted for demographic and behavioral risk factors, health status, and body mass index. Mortality risk was less across increasing
quartiles of light PA volume (AC91000) when compared with the least quartile (AC ≤61.8); the least risk occurred in the upper
quartile of light PA, AC >98.5 (hazard ratios=0.69, 95% confidence interval: 0.47, 1.00, P trend ≤0.05). The benefits for mortality
risk were greater across quartiles of moderate-to-vigorous PA and reached a hazard ratio of 0.28 (95% confidence interval: 0.17,
0.46, P trend ≤0.05) for AC >187.9, when compared with the referent group (AC ≤50.8). Results examining various combinations
of light and moderate-to-vigorous intensity-specific volumes demonstrated the strong influence of total activity on mortality risk.
Conclusions-—In this population, increasing light PA was associated with less mortality, but at an approximately equal volume of
PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA appeared to have greater benefits. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e008815. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.

P
hysical inactivity—defined as not achieving physical
activity (PA) guidelines—accounts for as much as 6% to
10% of the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary
heart disease, and cancer1—conditions that collectively
account for nearly half of all deaths.2 It is therefore not
surprising that the United States and other countries have
endorsed
PA
guidelines
for
health.
The
general
recommendation is that adults should engage in adequate
moderate-to-vigorous PA, with moderate-intensity activities
defined as those with an energy cost of 3 to 5.9 metabolic
equivalents, and vigorous intensity activities as those expend-
ing 6 or more metabolic equivalents.3–5 The Physical Activity
Guidelines for Americans specifically suggest that adults can
meet the recommendation by achieving a minimum overall
volume of PA activity by accumulating 150 min/wk of moder-
ate-intensity activity or 75 min/wk of vigorous intensity activity
or an equivalent combination of the 2 intensities. This is
consistent with the idea that an equal volume (ie, duration9in-
tensity) of moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity
rather than intensity per se is associated with substantial health
benefits.4 Although this recommendation emphasizes the
importance of the volume of moderate-intensity PA for better
health, it is unclear whether even lower intensity physical
activities (nonsedentary light-intensity activities, <3 metabolic
equivalents) also confer similar health benefits.
Accelerometer-based studies demonstrate the mortality
benefits for the duration (hours per day) of light and moderate-
to-vigorous intensity activity; most studies suggest a stronger
association for greater-intensity activity.6–11 For example,
Matthews et al found that a 1 h/d increase of light-intensity

 activity was associated with 16% less mortality, whereas a 1 h/
d increase of moderate-to-vigorous activity was associated with
40% less mortality.9 However, these studies focused only on PA
duration; they did not account for the greater volume of energy
expended per hour for moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity.
Thus, it is unclear whether the stronger associations for
moderate-to-vigorous activity are simply because of the greater
volume of activity accumulated per unit of time in moderate or
vigorous activity when compared with light-intensity activity.
The benefits of an equivalent volume of moderate- or
vigorous-intensity activity is generally accepted; however,
whether an equal volume of light-intensity activity confers
benefits similar to those associated with higher-intensity
activity of the same volume is still an open question. Here, we
sought to test the hypothesis that equal volumes of light and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity have similar mortality
benefits using device-based measures of PA from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2003–
2006 cycles with mean mortality follow-up of 6.6 years.
Methods
Study Population
The data, analytic methods, and study materials are available
to other researchers for purposes of reproducing the results
or replicating the procedure. Data are available at https://
wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/Default.aspx
and
additional
details about the analytical methods can be provided upon
request. This study used publicly available accelerometer data
for the US population from the 2003–2006 NHANES cycles.
The NHANES includes several health behavior indicators
including PA; it is based on a complex, multistage, probability
sampling design of all ages in order to reflect the health
status of the US population. Mortality was ascertained using
information available from the National Death Index through
December 31, 2011. The study population was restricted to
adults aged ≥40 years (N=6355 respondents). The NHANES
study was approved by the National Center for Health
Statistics Research Ethics Review Board, and all participants
were required to provide signed consent for participation.
PA Measures
PA was measured with a uniaxial accelerometer (AM-7164;
ActiGraph) and a standard 7-day measurement protocol12;
participants were instructed to wear the monitor at the waist at
alltimesexceptforbathingandsleep.Thedeviceswereinitialized
to collect activity counts (AC) in 1-minute epochs. Accumulated
AC provide an accurate estimate of the duration and intensity of
body movement at the waist and were summed across the whole
day toassess total PAvolume.13Usingestablished cut points,we
summed the accumulated volume of activity as AC in nonseden-
tary light (100<AC<760) and moderate-to-vigorous activity
(≥760 AC). We also summed nonsedentary total activity counts
(TAC;AC>100).Thesecutpointsprovideusefulapproximationsof

nonwear time,12 4840 subjects had at least 1 valid day of
accelerometer data (wear ≥10 h/d).
Covariates
Consistent with our previous work with this data set,9 we
included a number of covariates in our modeling of the
association between PA and mortality. These included age
(years), sex, race-ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, or other), education (less than high school, high
school diploma, or high school or more), alcohol consumption
(never, former, or current), smoking status (never, former, or
current), body mass index (in kg/m2: <25, 25–29.9, or ≥30),
and self-reported diagnosis (yes/no) of diabetes mellitus,
coronary artery disease, stroke, cancer, and reduced mobility
(difficulty in walking a quarter mile or up 10 stairs).

Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This study examines whether the stronger benefits associ-
ated with moderate-to-vigorous PA are simply because of
the greater volume of activity accumulated per unit of time
as compared with light-intensity activity.
• Total volume of PA rather than intensity seems to be the key
driver in reducing the risk for all-cause mortality.
• The difference in mortality benefits associated with moder-
ate-to-vigorous PA are only modest in comparison to light
PA after accounting for the volume of PA.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• Our study can provide valuable information for practitioners
working with individuals who can benefit from regular
participation in PA.
• These findings add flexibility for clinical practice when
providing individuals with options for combining activities of
different intensities (eg, light and moderate-to-vigorous PA).
• Our results are particularly relevant for practitioners work-
ing with inactive segments of the population, whose
preferences may rely on light PA when starting an exercise
program.

 moderate-to-vigorous PA, and TAC or total PA, were classified
by quartiles. The data distributions resulted in quartile cutoffs
of 61.8, 80.5, and 98.5 AC91000 for accumulated counts in
light PA, 50.8, 110.2, and 187.9 AC91000 for moderate-to-
vigorous PA, and 122.3, 197.9, and 283.1 AC91000 for total
PA.
Our primary analysis used Cox proportional hazard models
to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals
(HR [95% CI]) for mortality when adjusted for all covariates. We
first examined the distributions of light- and moderate-to-
vigorous PA across each stratum of covariates. To examine
main effects using the respective bottom quartile as the
referent group (ie, bottom quartiles, ≤61.8 AC for light PA,
≤50.8 AC for moderate-to-vigorous PA; and ≤122.3 AC for
total PA), Cox proportional hazard models were computed
separately for light, moderate-to-vigorous PA, and total PA
quartiles. To examine the relative benefits of various combi-
nations of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA volumes, we then
computed additional Cox proportional models for the joint
associations of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA quartiles.
The referent group for these analyses was defined by the least
PA quartiles for both light and for moderate-to-vigorous PA,
with ≤61.8 AC for light PA and ≤50.8 AC for moderate-to-
vigorous PA. The HRs associated with these joint combinations
were plotted against total PA volume (average total PA; TAC)
accumulated by each joint combination of quartiles.
Supplemental analyses included a more detailed examina-
tion of accelerometer compliance (wear time) and distribu-
tions of sedentary, light, moderate-to-vigorous, and total PA
across
quartiles
of
light
and
moderate-to-vigorous
PA
(Table S1). The distributions of activity (Table S2) and death
records (Table S3) were also examined by joint quartiles of
light- and moderate-to-vigorous PA. Sensitivity analyses were
conducted to account for possible reverse causality by
replicating our fully adjusted models and excluding partici-
pants with <1 and 2 years of follow-up. We tested and
confirmed the proportional hazards assumption for all our key
exposures (light, moderate-to-vigorous PA, and total PA). All
analyses were conducted using SAS 9.3v� and SUDAAN� to
incorporated sample weights and adjust for the complex
survey design. For descriptive statistics, we used Proc
Descript (continuous variables) and Proc Crosstab (categorical
variables) while the associations between mortality and PA
were assessed using Proc Survival.
Results
A total of 4840 adults (49.7% male; 55.0% non-Hispanic white;
35.8% obese) aged 40 years and older had complete data and
were followed over a period of 6.6 years, during which 700
deaths occurred. Participants had an average of 13.8 h/d,
and 5.8 days of monitor wear, 8.2 h/d sedentary, 4.1 hours
in light PA, and 1.3 h/d in moderate-to-vigorous PA (note that
these are accumulated duration with no bout criteria). Overall,
the least active quartiles of either light- or moderate-to-
vigorous PA had greater proportions of participants who were
obese, non-Hispanic white, less educated, and with chronic
diseases (diabetes mellitus, cancer, and others) (Table 1).

Volume of Physical Activity and All-Cause Mortality

 We first examined the mortality associations separately for
the volumes of light- and moderate-to-vigorous intensity
activity, as well as total activity (Table 2). Significantly less
mortality risk was noted for greater light-intensity activity
volume
before
and
after
adjusting
for
covariates
and
moderate-to-vigorous activity. In fully adjusted models, par-
ticipants
in
the
greatest
light-intensity
category
(>98.5 AC91000) had 31% less risk (HR=0.69 [95% CI,
0.47–1.00]) than those with less than 61.8 AC91000.
Greater moderate-to-vigorous activity was also inversely
associated with mortality risk after adjustment for covariates
and light activity. Notably, the second quartile of moderate-to-
vigorous PA (50.8 to ≤110.2 AC/1000) had roughly the same
volume of PA as the greatest quartile of light activity (noted
above); and was associated with 46% less risk (HR=0.54 [95%
CI, 0.42–0.70]) compared with the least quartile of moderate-
to-vigorous PA. Greater volume of moderate-to-vigorous
activity was associated with even lower mortality risk. It is
important to note that because of the large differences in the
distributions of PA volume accumulated in light and moderate-
to-vigorous PA, there was limited overlap in terms of equal
volume of PA in the quartiles for each intensity of PA. The
strength of associations for total PA was comparable to those
for moderate-to-vigorous activity.
Given the significant mortality benefits for both light and
moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA, we next explored the com-
bined influence of both intensities, by jointly classifying PA
exposure. In all comparisons, the referent group was the least in
light- and moderate-to-vigorous activity. Among those with the
least moderate-to-vigorous activity (≤50.8 AC91000), greater
amounts of light PA were associated with 30% to 40% less
mortality risk. In contrast, among those with the least light
activity (≤61.8 AC91000), greater moderate-to-vigorous PA
was associated with a 60% to 90% less mortality risk; however, CI
were wide for the most active group (Table 3). In general, the
greatestreductionsinriskwereassociatedwithagreatervolume
of both light- and moderate-to-vigorous PA. This suggests that
the total volume of PA (light and moderate-to-vigorous) was
important for risk reduction. In sensitivity analyses of Table 3,
the HR remained similar after excluding the first 1 and 2 years of
follow-up. With these exclusions, the associations were atten-
uated by 5% to 8% and CI widened (Table S4).
To better understand the interrelations between light and
moderate-to-vigorous PA and total activity volume, we plotted

 the 16 hazard ratios in Table 3 by mean TAC and described
the proportion of TAC accumulated in each intensity category
(Figure). Addition of information about total activity volume
demonstrates the strong influence of total activity on
mortality risk, and the relative contributions of light and
moderate-to-vigorous PA for increasing total activity in these
data.
Discussion
In this prospective study conducted in a representative
sample of US adults using device-measured PA, we found the
volume of both light and moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA to
be associated with less mortality after mutual adjustments.
However, at similar volumes of PA, moderate-to-vigorous
activity was more strongly associated with mortality risk
reduction than light-intensity PA (46% versus 31% lower risk).
This finding suggests an added benefit of greater-intensity PA
(moderate-to-vigorous) over light activity. Our exploration of
the joint associations of light- and moderate-to-vigorous
activity volume on mortality showed that greater light activity
had a stronger influence among those doing the least
moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity, but there was only
limited evidence of an influence of light activity at greater
levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity activity.
Our findings extend previous accelerometer-based studies
of the duration of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA and
mortality that may be confounded in part by not considering
differences in PA volume associated with intensity. Previous
studies examining this question have focused only on the
duration of PA (minutes of intensity-specific activity). While
the duration of an activity is more easily measured and
interpretable, inferences about intensity-specific effects are
limited by the lack of control over the total volume of
exposure. In these studies, moderate-to-vigorous PA appeared
to have substantially greater mortality benefits than did light
PA (�0–30% for light PA and 40–80% for moderate-to-
vigorous PA).7–11 The large difference in risk reduction is
consistent with our supplemental analyses (Figure S1). Our
study extends previous studies by estimating the volume of
intensity-specific PA, using total activity counts—which
reflect both the duration and intensity of activity—to estimate
PA volume. We found that greater intensity activity appeared
to have greater mortality benefits, although the differences we
observed (0–24%) were not as large as in previous duration
studies, or when compared with our replicated analysis using
PA duration (Figure versus Figure S1).
Examination of the relative contributions of light or
moderate-to-vigorous PA volume to mortality was challenging.
One critical challenge was the limited overlap among the
distributions of light and moderate-to-vigorous PA volume. It
appears that few individuals accumulate their total PA at
relatively
similar
contributions
of
light
and
moderate-
to-vigorous PA. For example, the joint quartile 2,2 light:-
moderate-to-vigorous PA was one of a few that had similar
contributions of light and moderate-to-vigorous intensity
volume to total (71.9 versus 77.7 AC for a
total of
149.6 AC91000; Table S2). The stratified approach described
in Figure provides a good illustration of this issue. The jointly
classified categories were associated with wide ranges of TAC;
and the upper quartiles of moderate-to-vigorous had much
greater total volumes of activity compared with those for light-
intensity activity. Thus, while contributing substantially to total
activity duration (Figure S1), light-intensity activity was much
less of a driver of total activity volume.
Strengths of this study include evaluation of a nationally
representative cohort of US adults with device-measured PA.
We examined the associations between PA and mortality
while adjusting for various confounders, including age,
comorbidities, and mobility limitations. Information on these
confounders is not always readily available for consideration
in etiologic studies examining the benefits of PA; however,
despite these adjustments, we cannot rule out possible larger
effects among older individuals at higher risk for mobility
complications. Our method to estimate intensity-specific
activity volume is also novel and a strength of this study.
The application of device-based measures of PA is evolving17;
our estimates of light and moderate-to-vigorous intensity
activity duration have been evaluated and found to be
reasonably accurate in comparison to a range of criterion

 measures.15,16,18 To determine the volume of PA, we
estimated intensity-specific activity counts—a metric demon-
strated to be a good proxy for total volume of PA.13 We also
chose a widely accepted threshold to distinguish sedentary
behavior from PA (100 AC)19 and a light/moderate-to-
vigorous threshold designed to capture a broader range of
lifestyle and ambulatory activities in adults (760 AC).14 There
are a variety of published cut points,18 and NHANES studies
have commonly used 2020 counts/min, which is based on
ambulatory calibrations, to define moderate-to-vigorous PA.
The choice of a cut point calibrated to capture a broader
range of moderate-to-vigorous activity or one calibrated to
capture only walking and running to distinguish light from
moderate-to-vigorous PA has important implications when
classifying activity. Although we recognize there may be a
wide range of opinions about the best method, we believe
potential misclassification with our approach will provide a
more conservative estimate of the association between
mortality for each PA intensity. Thus, if the 760 count/min
threshold overestimates moderate PA, light-intensity activity
would be classified as moderate activity, potentially diluting
the strength of the observed moderate-intensity associations.
In contrast, if ambulatory cut points underestimate moderate
PA, moderate-intensity activity would be classified as light
activity, potentially overestimating the strength of the light-
intensity associations. A potential limitation of our approach
is that the accuracy of our estimates of light and moderate-to-
vigorous PA volume has not been fully explored; it may be that
measurement error is greater for our estimates of light
intensity.20 This limitation also relates to a general limitation
of device-based monitors that are not able to capture
nonambulatory activities (eg, bicycling or activities while
standing). There were also a relatively small number of
deaths. This limited our ability to match activity volumes by
Figure. Hazard ratios* for jointly classified quartiles of light, moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity (PA) from Table 3 for each category: by total activity
counts (TAC, per 1000). *HR 1,1 is for quartile 1 for both types of activity, while
HR 4,1 is for quartile 4 of light PA and quartile 1 of moderate-to-vigorous PA, etc.
The amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) as a proportion of total activity
counts (TAC) is reflected by color (least MVPA bright yellow, most MVPA dark red).
For example, quartiles 2,2 accumulated on average 150 counts (per 1000) in total
activity and �50% of the TAC was accumulated in moderate-to-vigorous PA
intensity. The remaining 50% were accumulated in light PA intensity. Joint
quartiles filled with orange indicate joint distributions with relatively similar
contributions of moderate-to-vigorous and light PA to total physical activity.

 intensity and to create finer gradations of volumes to study
combined-intensity effects. Furthermore, although we con-
trolled for many relevant confounding factors and several
chronic conditions, and our sensitivity analysis did not reveal
consistent evidence of reverse causality, we cannot com-
pletely rule out the influence of reverse-causality bias.
To our knowledge, this is the first study to explore the
differences in volume accumulated through light and moder-
ate-to-vigorous PA and their associations with all-cause
mortality. We found moderate-to-vigorous PA to provide
greater benefits than light PA; however, the difference in
benefits because of intensity was less than that associated
with PA duration (Figure versus Figure S1). Future studies
should explore these associations using data from other
cohorts, with longer follow-up periods, and more sophisticated
methods of activity intensity classification. A better under-
standing of the interplay between light PA and moderate-to-
vigorous PA for mortality risk reduction is critical and can have
important implications for clinical practice and public health
recommendations. The current US PA guidelines reinforce the
importance of volume by allowing for various combinations of
moderate and vigorous intensity activities to achieve the
recommended amounts of PA per week. The examination of the
relative contribution of light PA to total PA volume can clarify
whether lower-intensity activities can be factored into these
recommendations. As demonstrated in our study, the benefit
ratio between light and moderate is hard to disentangle. While
our findings suggest that light PA has benefits, participation in
moderate-to-vigorous PA is needed to obtain maximal health
benefits. The consideration of light-intensity activities to
achieve benefits for health is particularly important among
inactive individuals, who are at higher risk for comorbidities
and are less likely to engage in physically active behaviors.

 Figure S1. Hazard ratios* for jointly classified quartiles of light, moderate-to-vigorous 
physical activity from Table 3 for each category: by Total activity duration (TAD). 
*HR 1,1 is for quartile 1 for both type of activity, while HR 4,1 is for quartile 4 of light PA and quartile 1 of
moderate-to-vigorous PA, etc.  
The amount of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) as a proportion of total activity counts (TAC) is reflected by color 
(least MVPA bright yellow, most MVPA dark red). For example, quartiles 4,1 spent on average 400 minutes in total 
activity and approximately 10% of the total activity duration was spent on moderate-to-vigorous PA intensity. The 
remaining 90% were spent in light PA intensity. Joint quartiles filled with orange indicate joint distributions with 
relatively similar contributions of moderate-to-vigorous and light PA to total physical activity.
