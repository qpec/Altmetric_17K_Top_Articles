Topical oils on baby skin may contribute to development 
of childhood atopic eczema. A pilot, assessor-blinded, 
randomized controlled trial assessed feasibility of a de-
finitive trial investigating their impact in neonates. One-
hundred and fifteen healthy, full-term neonates were ran-
domly assigned to olive oil, sunflower oil or no oil, twice 
daily for 4 weeks, stratified by family history of atopic 
eczema. We measured spectral profile of lipid lamellae, 
trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum 
hydration and pH and recorded clinical observations, at 
baseline, and 4 weeks post-birth. Recruitment was chal-
lenging (recruitment 11.1%; retention 80%), protocol 
adherence reasonable (79–100%). Both oil groups had 
significantly improved hydration but significantly less 
improvement in lipid lamellae structure compared to 
the no oil group. There were no significant differences 
in TEWL, pH or erythema/skin scores. The study was 
not powered for clinical significance, but until further 
research is conducted, caution should be exercised when 
recommending oils for neonatal skin. Key words: infant; 
skin barrier function; topical oils.

Neonatal dry skin is a normal adaptation to the extraute-
rine environment following birth. The primary function 
of baby skin is to provide a barrier, firstly to water loss 
and secondly to penetration from external irritants and 
allergens (1). Some research has suggested that there 
is a potential for development of atopic eczema (AE) 
(synonym atopic dermatitis) if topical products with 
adverse effects on skin barrier function are used for the 
prevention or treatment of baby dry skin (2, 3). 
AE is a disease resulting from gene environment 
interactions leading to breakdown of the skin barrier, 
cutaneous inflammation and allergy (4, 5). Prevalence 
has increased from 5% of children aged 2 to 15 years in 
the 1940s (6) to approaching 30% more recently (7). Ap-
proximately 60% of diagnoses are made in the first year 
and 45% in the first 6 months of life (4), a period when 
midwives and other related health professionals poten-
tially have an influence over parental caring practices. 
Genetic changes cannot account for this increased inci-
dence, but there has been an increase in potentially linked 
environmental factors including the increased availability 
and use of baby skincare products. It has been suggested 
that certain topical oils instigate a weakness in the skin 
barrier (2, 8, 9). There may be a link between early use 
of certain types and formulations of oils on baby skin and 
the development of AE; this requires further research.
Extra care of baby skin is important due to differences 
in the biological composition between baby and adult 
skin. The stratum corneum (SC), a principal component 
of the epidermal barrier, is 30% thinner, and the over-
all epidermis is 20% thinner in babies (10). Although 
newborn skin is sufficiently developed to withstand the 
extrauterine environment at full term (≥ 37 weeks gesta-
tion), its biophysical and biological properties such as 
corneocytes size, SC hydration and pH, lipid composi-
tion and structure, natural moisturising factor (NMF) 
and water composition continue to be in a transitional 
state during the early years of life (11–13). Given that 
babies have a propensity for reduced skin barrier func-
tion, careful consideration should be given to topical 
products used on baby skin to ensure that the developing 
epidermal barrier is not adversely altered or affected. 
Alteration in the lipid composition and structure of the 
SC is linked to reduced skin permeability function and 
AE (14–16). Only skincare products which are proven 
to enhance the integrity, barrier and/or immune function 
of baby skin should be recommended.
There is no national guidance on neonatal skincare. 
The United Kingdom (UK) Postnatal Care Guidelines 
(17) briefly mention only cleansing in relation to baby 
skincare. There is no national or international guidance 
with regard to using topical oils. The practice of recom-
mending and using topical oils for the prevention or 
treat 
ment of baby dry skin or for massage has developed 
as a traditional practice, rather than be based on evidence 
(18, 19). It has been suggested that there is a readiness 
to believe that what is ‘natural’ is ‘safe’ (20, 21). There

has been a growth in societal interest in ‘natural’ pro-
ducts (22), particularly for babies (23). Parents follow 
the advice of health professionals regarding the care of 
their baby (20). It is necessary to provide evidence from 
which health professionals can offer the best advice for 
baby skincare, to avoid harmful practices. 
A literature review conducted prior to the study iden-
tified 3 studies that investigated the use of topical oils on 
term newborn babies. One study considered olive oil (24) 
but the outcome under investigation was detachment of 
the umbilical cord stump, rather than dry skin. The other 
studies considered skincare; both being randomized con-
trolled trials (RCTs) (25–27). The BEEP pilot study (26, 
27) (n = 124) saw a trend toward improved skin barrier 
function in the intervention group (26) and concluded 
that a daily full-body emollient therapy from birth can 
prevent AE (27). Babies randomized to the treatment 
arm could choose a defined sunflower seed oil with high 
linoleic acid/low oleic acid content, a specific emollient 
cream/gel or a specific emollient ointment. Only 23.4% 
(n = 15) of participants in the intervention arm chose 
sunflower seed oil. Results were provided as a total of 
participants for the treatment arm so it is not possible to 
assess results specific to the sunflower oil only, but the 
study was not powered to detect this. Solanki et al. (25) 
compared safflower oil (ratio of linoleic acid to oleic acid 
not reported) to coconut oil to no oil amongst preterm 
(< 34 weeks gestation; n = 42 and 34–37 weeks gestation; 
n = 30) and term babies (> 37 weeks gestation; n = 46). 
The study was not powered and the main outcome was 
fatty acid profiling, but clinical observations and AE 
were also monitored throughout the 5-day treatment pe-
riod. None of the studies measured TEWL, SC hydration 
or pH. No trials have considered whether using topical 
oils is beneficial to healthy term baby skin. 
Prior to the study we conducted a national survey of 
UK maternity and neonatal units. The survey found that 
routine practice was to recommend topical olive oil or 
sunflower oil to new parents for their baby’s dry skin 
(19). We therefore conducted a pilot RCT to compare 
the topical use of a specific sunflower oil (high linoleic 
acid, low oleic acid) to a specific olive oil (low linoleic 
acid, high oleic acid) to no oil. We hypothesized that the 
regular application of the specific sunflower oil, when 
compared to no oil or specific olive oil, would improve 
the skin barrier function of newborn term babies. From 
the study design stage we involved a Trial Steering Com-
mittee made up of independent specialists in nursing, 
midwifery, pediatrics, clinical trials, dermatology, and 
patient user groups including a representative from the 
National Eczema Society and a parent representative.
The pilot was designed to address the following 
aspects in the design of a definitive study: proof of 
concept of what, if any, effect oils have on baby skin 
barrier function, the suitability of Attenuated Total 
Reflectance Fourier Transform Infra-red spectroscopy 
(ATR-FTIR) as an outcome measure, optimal primary 
outcome measure, sample size calculation, optimal 
trial design (recruitment rates, protocol adherence and 
acceptability), and optimal trial management processes 
(patient information provision, consent, data recording).
METHODS (for complete details see Appendix S11)
Study site and population
A pilot, assessor-blinded, RCT was conducted in St. Mary’s 
Hospital, Manchester, North West England. We set a target 
sample size of 100 babies to allow for 30 per group after a 
10% anticipated loss to follow-up. We included those with and 
without a family history of AE. The sample size was considered 
to be sufficient to explore differences in outcomes and provide 
data capable of determining feasibility for a definitive trial (28). 
The trial was approved by Greater Manchester East Research 
Ethics Committee (13/NW/0512).
Recruitment and randomization
Babies of women who gave consent were randomized to one 
of the intervention groups or the control group within 72 h of 
birth. Randomization was 1:1:1 via a central telephone-based 
service provided by The Christie Hospital NHS Foundation Trust 
Clinical Trials Unit. The randomization sequence was computer 
generated. Randomization was stratified according to whether 
or not there was a family history of AE, where at least one of 
father, mother, or sibling had a medical diagnosis of AE and 
had been prescribed topical steroid treatment. The randomiza-
tion was in blocks within eczema history strata (yes, no) and 
the block size varied at random between 6 and 15 (i.e. 6, 9, 12 
or 15) to guard against predictability. Allocation was concealed 
from the participant and independent research midwife until 
the point of allocation. Babies were randomized to one of 3 
groups: olive oil, sunflower oil or no oil (control). The study 
was assessor-blinded, and participants in the intervention groups 
were blinded to which oil they were using; oils were labelled X 
and Y. Participant blinding was impossible for the control group 
as there is no control oil that we could be confident was safe to 
apply and would have no effect on skin barrier function (29).
Intervention
Olive oil and sunflower oil of specific defined formulation 
(William Hodgson and Co, Congleton, United Kingdom; see 
Table I) were provided for the intervention groups as appro-
priate. Parents began using the oil as instructed from the day 
after the initial assessment. Parents applied 4 drops of oil to 
their baby’s left forearm, left thigh and abdomen, twice a day. 
No oils were applied on the day of assessment to avoid any

The oil in baby SkincaRE (OBSeRvE) study
interference with results that may have been caused by oil 
residues, and to maintain assessor blinding. Parents in all 3 
groups were asked not to use any other skincare products on 
the 3 study sites; water only was advocated. 
Assessment of trial outcomes
All measurements were taken by the investigator who remained 
blind to the treatment allocation. Data were collected at two 
time points. The first assessment was conducted at baseline 
prior to discharge from the hospital. A second assessment was 
made at 4 weeks ± 5 days.
Primary outcomes
ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. The change in structure of the lipid 
lamellae, a determinant of SC permeability barrier function 
(30), was assessed between 48 h and 4 weeks following birth 
using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy. This technique has been used 
previously to demonstrate the effect of oleic acid on skin bar-
rier (8). At each spectroscopy measurement site on the skin 
surface an absorbance spectrum was collected on intact skin 
and following the application and removal (tape-stripping) of 
3 consecutive D-Squame discs (CuDerm Corporation, Dallas, 
TX, USA) to reassess the deeper corneocyte layers of the SC. 
Data analysis of absorbance spectra was performed in Omnic 
9.0 and TQuant (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, USA). 
The difference in the quantity of lipids and lipid esters in the 
skin was determined based upon the change in peak intensities 
of the spectral regions centred on ~2,920 and ~2,850 wavenum-
bers (31). Lipid chain conformation (vasymCH2 COG) was based 
on the location (centre of gravity: COG) of the peak between 
~2,853 and ~2,848 wavenumbers, corresponding to the asym-
metric stretching of the CH2 bond of lipids (32, 33). Lateral 
chain packing was determined from the second derivative re-
flectance spectra by measuring the full width at half maximum 
(FWHM) of the spectral region centred at 1,468 wavenumbers 
(30). The difference in the quantity of surfactants in the skin, 
measured to assess adherence regarding use of wash products, 
was determined based upon the change in peak intensity of the 
spectral region centred on 1,240 wavenumbers, corresponding 
to the sulphur group of surfactants found in wash products (34). 
Trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). This outcome measured 
the rate of change of basal trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) 
between 48 h and 4 weeks after birth. TEWL, a validated mea-
sure of skin barrier function (35), was measured using a closed 
chamber TEWL instrument (Biox Aquaflux Model AF200). The 
lead investigator took the measurements at both time points, 
at each study site twice, before and after tape-stripping, in ac-
cord with published guidelines for TEWL measurements (36).
Secondary outcomes
Stratum corneum hydration and skin surface pH. The change 
in SC hydration and skin surface pH between 48 h and 4 weeks 
were measured at the same times and sites as the primary out-
come measures using a Corneometer® Model CM825 [Courage 
& Khazaka electronic GmbH, Köln, Germany] and skin pH 
meter® Model PH905 [Courage & Khazaka electronic GmbH].
Clinical observations. Changes in the skin were observed 
and recorded by the investigator at baseline and follow-up 
(erythema, dryness and scaling, need for medical products/
attention) between 48 h and 4 weeks. The investigator asses-
sed the babies’ skin according to a modified Neonatal Skin 
Condition Score (NSCS; 37). Erythema was measured using 
a Mexameter® Model MX18 probe at each visit [Courage & 
Khazaka electronic GmbH].
Analysis
Data were double-entered into IBM SPSS Statistics version 
20 and analysed in version 22, with the two data files cross-
checked for errors. In accordance with recommended practice 
for pilot studies (28), the main analyses were descriptive, 
involving the estimation of recruitment rates, attrition rates, 
adherence rates, means and standard deviations of primary and 
secondary outcomes by group at baseline and 4 weeks, and 95% 
confidence intervals (CI) for differences of means of change 
scores of primary and secondary outcomes between groups at 4 
weeks. Missing values at 4 weeks were not carried forward or 
imputed; descriptive analysis at 4 weeks was based on complete 
data, compared by randomization group. The latter comparisons 
were confirmed by analysis of covariance.
RESULTS
Data were collected between September 2013 and July 
2014. We approached 1,037 mothers and 115 consented 
to participate (recruitment rate: 11.1%). The recruit-
ment flow chart is illustrated in Fig. S11, which includes 
detail of reasons for declining and loss to follow-up. 
Baseline characteristics were homogenous across the 3 
groups (Table SI1). Approximately 32% of infants had 
a family history of AE; stratification ensured that these 
were evenly distributed across the 3 groups. There were 
no differences in ambient conditions across the groups 
for each visit (Table SII1). 
Protocol adherence
Protocol adherence was explored for the assessment of 
feasibility, both to treatment allocation regime and regar-
ding other product use. Adherence was measured from 
the ATR-FTIR sebum data and mother’s self-reporting in 
the weekly telephone questionnaires and final follow-up 
questionnaire. The most adherent group was the control 
group for both treatment use and product avoidance. 
The proportion of lipid esters in the SC was elevated 
in the two oil groups compared to the no oil group on 
all test sites (data not shown), evidencing the use of 
oils, which both contain high levels of lipid esters on 
the skin. The weekly ranges of adherence for treatment 
use were 79% to 93% of participants for the olive oil 
group, 83% to 94% for the sunflower oil group and 100% 
for the no oil group (Table SIII1). The ranges for other 
product avoidance were 57% to 89%, 70% to 87% and 
74% to 100%, respectively (Table SIII1). Overall, there 
were no significant differences in adherence across the 
groups. However, there was a noticeable decrease in 
compliance with regard to product use in week 4 for all 
groups. The actual number of mothers using alternative 
products on their babies may be higher as adherence was 
self-reported. Analysis of the ATR-FTIR spectra sup-
ported the data collected from the mothers by indicating 
no significant differences in the change in proportion 
of sulphur groups in the skin at 4 weeks between the 
groups (data not shown), suggesting no difference in the

use of cleansers containing sulphate surfactants, which 
represent the largest class of cleansers in skincare (34).
Primary outcomes
As shown in Table SIV1, there were no significant dif-
ferences for TEWL between the trial arms for all body 
sites. The ATR-FTIR spectroscopy data showed that both 
oil groups contained a significantly higher proportion of 
lipids within the SC, compared to the no oil group. All 
groups exhibited improvement in lipid chain conforma-
tion and lateral packing over the 4 week treatment period, 
as indicated by a shift in vasymCH2 COG to a lower wa-
venumber and an increase in the FWHM, respectively. 
However the extent of this improvement was signifi-
cantly reduced in the groups using oils compared to the 
no oil group. For olive oil compared to no oil, there was 
a difference in lipid chain conformation and lateral pack-
ing pre tape-stripping (e.g. at the abdomen: lipid chain 
conformation mean difference = 1.02, 95% CI 0.66–1.38, 
p < 0.001; lateral chain packing mean difference= –0.92, 
95% CI –1.40 to –0.44, p < 0.001) and post tape-stripping 
(conformation mean difference=0.85, 95% CI 0.46–1.23, 
p < 0.001; packing mean difference= –0.95, 95% CI 
–1.50 to –0.40, p = 0.001), suggesting a more persistent 
fluid-like (less ordered) state. For sunflower oil compared 
to no oil, these differences occurred pre tape-stripping 
(e.g. at the abdomen: lipid chain conformation mean 
difference = 0.88, 95% CI 0.52–1.25, p < 0.001 ; lateral 
chain packing mean difference = –1.27, 95% CI –1.82 
to –0.73, p < 0.001) but were not so marked post tape-
stripping (conformation mean difference = 0.54, 95% CI 
0.15–0.93, p = 0.007; packing mean difference = –0.49, 
95% CI –1.12–0.14, p = 0.121) indicating that they may 
be more restricted to the superficial layers of the SC. 
There were no significant differences between the two 
oil groups in lipid chain conformation or lateral chain 
packing. Full results can be viewed in Table SIV1. 
Secondary outcomes
As shown in Table III, both oil groups were signifi-
cantly more hydrated than the no oil group at all 3 body 
sites. There were no significant differences for skin 
surface pH between the trial arms for all body sites. 
However, CI only just crossed the line of no difference. 
With regard to the clinical observations of the skin, 
none of the infants had severe dryness and/or scaling 
or rash and very few had mild to moderate dryness and/
or scaling or rash (see Table II). The majority had no or 
slight dryness and/or scaling or rash. At 4 weeks, skin 
condition score (NSCS) had improved overall. There 
were no significant differences across treatment groups 
for erythema at baseline or 4 weeks (see Table III).
Family history of atopic eczema 
Analysis of covariance found no significant effect for 
family history of AE in any of the primary or secondary 
outcomes apart from erythema on the thigh (p = 0.007). 
Mean erythema scores at follow-up were consistently 
numerically higher in babies without a family history 
at all 3 body sites for both oil groups and also on the 
abdomen and thigh for babies in the no oil group. This 
agreed with clinical observation of rash at follow-up, 
where a slight or mild rash was observed in 11/61 ba-
bies with no family history of AE compared with 2/31 
babies with a family history. A similar pattern occurred 
in each study arm and while there was no significant 
effect for family history in this small study, it would 
have to be monitored in further research. 
DISCUSSION
Data generated in the OBSeRvE study provided eviden-
ce that specific topical oils may have an adverse effect 
on skin barrier function, and informed the feasibility of

The oil in baby SkincaRE (OBSeRvE) study
a definitive trial with regard to recruitment, retention, 
protocol adherence, choice of optimal primary outcome 
measure and trial design.
Proof of concept
The primary purpose of conducting this study was to 
provide proof of concept that using specific types of 
defined topical oils have an effect on baby skin barrier 
function and the magnitude of that effect, and to assess 
the feasibility of conducting a robust definitive RCT 
of specific types of defined topical oils versus no oil 
for newborn term babies. This is the only trial we are 
aware of to investigate and compare the effect of the 
two most commonly recommended topical oils in the 
UK on term baby skin barrier function. The ATR-FTIR 
data provided evidence that topical oils may have a 
negative effect on baby skin. Significant differences in 
lipid structure were found in both oil groups, compared 
to the no oil group. All groups displayed an increased 
ordering of the lipids, both on the surface and within 
the SC, over the 4 weeks following birth, but this im-
provement was significantly less in the groups using 
the topical oils. This suggests that the oils may impede 
development of the lamellar lipid structures of the per-
meability barrier from birth. Reduction in the ordering 
of lipids throughout the SC is statistically significantly 
associated with decreased skin barrier function (30); 
this may increase the risk of developing AE. Moreover 
the skin of patients with AE, who display a skin bar-
rier defect, is characterized by reduced ordering of SC 
lipids determined using the same technique employed 
here (15, 16). No significant change in skin barrier 
function between the two oil groups was reported, but 
this pilot study was not sufficiently powered to detect 
such a difference. In adults, using a minimally inva-
sive technique not suitable for the assessment of baby 
skin, a significant adverse effect of olive oil on TEWL 
was observed (2). Free fatty acids, like oleic acid 
that accounts for the greatest proportion of the fatty 
acid components of olive oil triglycerides, are well-
documented penetration enhancers that increase TEWL 
when applied to the skin (38–40). Whilst triglycerides 
themselves do not penetrate the skin, as indicated by 
the sharp reduction in lipid esters in the skin following 
tape-stripping, lipases derived from the resident skin 
flora breakdown triglycerides to release glycerol and 
free fatty acids such as linoleic acid and oleic acid 
(41, 42). Glycerol is an important moisturising factor 
(humectant) found in the SC, increased levels of which 
increase skin hydration (43). Notably both oil groups 
exhibited elevated skin hydration compared with the 
no oil group. The process of triglyceride lipolysis helps 
explain why the topical oils appear to both hydrate the 
SC and disrupt the lipids of the lipid lamellae. The ty-
pes of fatty acids derived from olive oil and sunflower

seed oil are distinct; olive oil containing predominantly 
oleic acid and sunflower seed oil containing more 
linoleic acid. It is this different content of oleic and 
linoleic acid that has been implicated in positive and 
negative effects of different oils on the skin barrier (2, 
9). No significant differences in the effects of the two 
topical oils in this pilot study were found, but due to 
the limited sample size no conclusions can be drawn 
from this. The clinical importance of the difference 
found between the oil groups and no oil is unknown. 
This study provides important pilot data which consi-
ders for the first time the impact of using the two most 
commonly recommended topical oils in the UK, olive 
oil and sunflower oil, for the prevention or treatment of 
baby dry skin or baby massage. These oils continue to 
be recommended by midwives, health visitors and other 
neonatal health professionals as there is a common, but 
unfounded, belief that what is ‘natural’ is also ‘safe’ 
(20, 21). Our pilot data demonstrates that these oils may 
have a negative effect on skin barrier function. Further 
research to establish clinical importance is absolutely 
necessary, particularly in view of the potential link with 
the increasing prevalence of AE in children aged 2 to 
15 years (7). One recent randomized study of neonates 
using topical oil compared newborns washed with wa-
ter only (n = 52) to newborns washed daily with liquid 
baby cleanser and moisturized with topical almond oil 
(n = 42) (44). It is unclear if the study was powered, 
the level of protocol adherence or how homogenous 
the groups were. Contrary to our findings, there was 
a statistically significant difference in TEWL between 
the groups at day 10; higher in the intervention group. 
The intervention group alone used the cleansing agent 
so the specific effect of the oil cannot be determined. 
Cleansing may have adversely affected skin barrier 
function, resulting in higher TEWL values. The authors 
conclude that cleansing and moisturizing with oil may 
delay the natural maturation of skin barrier function. 
One study (45; n = 118) addressing prevention of AE 
has suggested, like Simpson et al. (27), that the use 
of a daily emollient therapy from birth reduces the 
incidence of AE in those with a family history of the 
condition. The Simpson et al. (27) and Horimukai et 
al. (45) studies only recruited babies at high risk of 
developing AE. Application of particular defined oils to 
skin of newborn babies predisposed to a defective skin 
barrier and AE may have different effects to those with 
no genetic predisposition to develop a defective skin 
barrier and AE. Topical oils are routinely recommended 
to healthy newborn babies who have dry skin or for 
baby massage. It is not known what number of these 
healthy babies may go on to develop AE and whether 
the two factors are linked. It is important to establish 
whether this link exists. Future studies should consider 
the effects of defined oils on the skin of babies with and 
without a genetic predisposition to AE.
Our hypothesis stated that the regular application of 
sunflower oil, when compared to no oil or olive oil, 
improved the skin barrier function of newborn term 
babies. This was not demonstrated by our pilot data. 
Sunflower oil was found to have a similar effect to 
olive oil on skin barrier function, both oils having a 
statistically significant negative effect compared to the 
no oil group. This negative effect of sunflower oil was 
unexpected in view of the existing evidence base high-
lighting the beneficial effects of topical sunflower oil 
in adults (2) and preterm infants (29, 46, 47). A recent 
study of topical sunflower oil with preterm infants (48), 
although a small sample (n = 22), found that sunflower 
oil may impede skin barrier development. This supports 
our findings and contrasts with the work of Darmstadt, 
who suggested that the positive effect of sunflower oil 
was linked to a barrier-enhancing effect. The positive 
effect found by Darmstadt may have more to do with 
the antimicrobial effect of sunflower oil. Unlike the 
Darmstadt population, our term baby population were 
not faced with a significant fatal infection risk. We 
suggest that whilst sunflower oil may not be a great 
barrier enhancing topical agent (perhaps the opposite), 
this does not detract from the very positive effect it has 
in situations where infection is a great risk. As these 
studies were not designed to determine the antimicrobial 
action of sunflower oil, it would be prudent to explore 
this in future studies.
Optimal primary outcome measure
This trial presents one of the largest neonatal datasets 
of novel information provided by the use of infrared 
spectroscopy. ATR-FTIR is important from an ethical 
perspective for a neonatal population as it provides a 
method to detect changes in the molecular composi-
tion of the SC before those changes are visible to the 
naked eye. There were some challenges with regard 
to the ATR-FTIR equipment: size, the need for liquid 
and dry nitrogen to operate the equipment, and the 
need for mothers to leave the postnatal ward to visit 
the assessment room for baseline assessment and 
return to the hospital with their 4-week-old baby for 
follow-up assessment as the equipment was not port-
able. However, having determined that the outcome 
measure provides useful and informative biological 
data within a short treatment period, the technology 
is available to provide the FTIR equipment in a smal-
ler, portable, bespoke device which would not require 
the use of liquid or dry nitrogen. Our study found that 
ATR-FTIR spectroscopy is suitable as an outcome 
measure. TEWL is a validated measure of skin barrier 
function (35). Although our data did not show any 
significant differences in TEWL between groups, it 
was not powered to detect this. TEWL as an outcome 
measure would still be recommended for a study with

The oil in baby SkincaRE (OBSeRvE) study
a larger sample size as it has been shown previously 
to detect changes in skin barrier function with the use 
of topical oils (2, 38–40).
Optimal trial design
The original target sample of 100 was increased to 
115 due to the higher than anticipated loss to follow-
up in order to recruit 30 per group with baseline and 
follow-up data. Only two home follow-up visits took 
place. The decision not to offer more home visits to 
increase retention was made due to the requirement 
to collect ATR-FTIR spectroscopy data at follow-up. 
Using a bespoke portable ATR-FTIR device would 
undoubtedly enhance recruitment and retention; base-
line assessment could be conducted at the bedside on 
the postnatal ward and home visits could be offered as 
a choice at follow-up. This helped to reduce attrition 
rates substantially in a previous similar trial (49). Loss 
to follow-up in the OBSeRvE pilot study compared fa-
vourably to a previous pilot study (20% vs. 58% (49)). 
Loss to follow-up of less than 10% would be optimal; 
this was achieved in a definitive trial when home visits 
were offered (50). Loss to follow-up was lowest in 
the no oil group. This may have been because there 
was no treatment regime to follow. Qualitative data to 
assess maternal satisfaction, from this study, suggests 
that women in the no oil group found their allocation 
‘easy’, but women in the oil groups conversely liked 
the ‘routine’ of applying oil. Qualitative data analysis 
is ongoing and will be published later. 
Babies were originally recruited within 48 h after birth 
to reduce the risk of infants having been bathed prior 
to baseline assessments. Even with a 48 h restriction in 
place some infants had already been bathed. The exten-
sion of the recruitment period to 72 h was deemed to have 
little effect on outcome data, but it increased the number 
of infants eligible to take part. The screening process was 
also amended to allow the lead investigator to identify 
eligible postnatal women from the hospital in-patient 
software (BedMan) by comparing each one against the 
eligibility criteria rather than the clinical team having 
to do this task. The lead investigator then approached 
the clinical midwife with the list of identified women to 
confirm if there was any reason not to approach them. 
This reduced the burden of time on the clinical team, 
and made the process of eligibility screening more ef-
ficient. Nevertheless, the overall recruitment rate was 
poor (11.1%). During a review of recruitment at the end 
of the study, the Trial Steering Committee agreed that 
it would not be necessary to exclude babies undergoing 
phototherapy treatment from a future study as the dura-
tion of phototherapy treatment is short and trial treatment 
could commence after this had ended. In addition, the 
clinical assessment room was only available on alternate 
days. This affected recruitment as babies could not be 
assessed on the day following recruitment, which was 
often the parent’s preference. Addressing both of these 
issues would improve the recruitment rate. 
Protocol adherence was fairly evenly distributed 
across the treatment groups but appeared to reduce 
with regard to alternative product use in the 4th week of 
the trial. This also occurred in a previous skincare trial 
(49) which suggested that a primary endpoint prior to 4 
weeks may be beneficial. The first follow-up assessment 
could be conducted at 3 weeks in a future study; how-
ever, adherence may still remain an issue. One solution 
would be to include a control soap for parents to use 
to bathe and cleanse their baby, however this would be 
problematic. If a good cleanser was used, the effects of 
the oils may be masked. If a poor cleanser was used, the 
negative effects could overwhelm the effect of the oils. 
The OBSeRvE pilot study was conducted to test the 
feasibility of a superiority hypothesis, that the regular 
application of defined sunflower oil, compared to no 
oil or defined olive oil, improved the skin barrier func-
tion of newborn term babies. However, our data sug-
gest that this was not the case. The sunflower oil was 
found to have a similar effect on skin barrier function 
to olive oil. Results were not powered to identify the 
optimal treatment for baby dry skin or massage; findings 
should therefore be interpreted with caution. A future 
study must address clinical importance. Our findings 
suggest that using olive oil or sunflower oil may have 
the potential to damage the skin barrier function of 
neonatal skin. This could consequently increase the 
development of AE. However, we cannot draw firm 
conclusions about the long-term effects of these topical 
oils as the relationship between the outcomes we asses-
sed and clinically important outcomes is unknown. It is 
necessary to investigate the link between use of defined 
topical oils from birth and development of AE. AE can 
develop at any age, with earliest diagnosis not usually 
before 4–6 months of age. This suggests that a longi-
tudinal observational study is necessary to explore the 
natural course of AE over a number of years following 
the use of topical oils together with more mechanistic 
studies in term babies to determine the biological re-
levance of the changes in lipid lamellae when topical 
oils are used from birth. These studies would inform a 
possible future definitive RCT. The optimal trial design 
should not only assess skin barrier function, but also the 
diagnosis of AE. The definitive trial should be designed 
with clinical outcomes to generate data that can inform 
clinical practice.
Conclusions
Our study provides valuable baseline data on the new-
born skin barrier using a novel technique. It also pro-
vides informative data on optimal trial processes. Our 
findings suggest that a definitive RCT may not be the 
optimal design for the next study about this topic. Be-

fore moving to further RCTs it is important to establish 
the biological importance of using defined topical oils 
from birth in babies with and without a genetic predis-
position to AE, and whether there is a link between this 
practice and the development of AE. We suggest that 
the immediate way forward is to conduct a long-term 
observational study to observe whether and when AE 
develops naturally depending on the use of topical oils 
from birth, together with further mechanistic studies 
to consider the optimal formulation.
Our study was not designed to provide definitive 
answers on whether or not specific defined olive or 
sunflower oils should be used on babies’ skin. The data 
suggested that the skin of babies who used the oils in 
this trial may be better hydrated; however the lipid 
structure of the skin barrier appeared altered, the clinical 
importance of which is unknown at present. Given that 
interventions should only be recommended if shown to 
do more good than harm, it would be difficult to support 
the use of sunflower or olive oils, based on our data. 
Further research is required to inform future practice.
