Abstract
Background
Sustained retention in HIV care (RIC) and viral suppression (VS) are central to US national
HIV prevention strategies, but have not been comprehensively assessed in criminal justice
(CJ) populations with known health disparities. The purpose of this study is to identify predic-
tors of RIC and VS following release from prison or jail.
Methods and findings
This is a retrospective cohort study of all adult people living with HIV (PLWH) incarcerated in
Connecticut, US, during the period January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2011, and observed
through December 31, 2014 (n = 1,094). Most cohort participants were unmarried (83.7%)
men (77.0%) who were black or Hispanic (78.1%) and acquired HIV from injection drug use
(72.6%). Prison-based pharmacy and custody databases were linked with community HIV
surveillance monitoring and case management databases. Post-release RIC declined
steadily over 3 years of follow-up (67.2% retained for year 1, 51.3% retained for years 1–2,
and 42.5% retained for years 1–3). Compared with individuals who were not re-incarcer-
ated, individuals who were re-incarcerated were more likely to meet RIC criteria (48% ver-
sus 34%; p < 0.001) but less likely to have VS (72% versus 81%; p = 0.048). Using
multivariable logistic regression models (individual-level analysis for 1,001 individuals after
excluding 93 deaths), both sustained RIC and VS at 3 years post-release were indepen-
dently associated with older age (RIC: adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.22–
2.12; VS: AOR = 1.37, 95% CI = 1.06–1.78), having health insurance (RIC: AOR = 2.15,
95% CI = 1.60–2.89; VS: AOR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.53–2.64), and receiving an increased
number of transitional case management visits. The same factors were significant when we

 assessed RIC and VS outcomes in each 6-month period using generalized estimating equa-
tions (for 1,094 individuals contributing 6,227 6-month periods prior to death or censoring).
Additionally, receipt of antiretroviral therapy during incarceration (RIC: AOR = 1.33, 95% CI
1.07–1.65; VS: AOR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.56–2.34), early linkage to care post-release (RIC:
AOR = 2.64, 95% CI = 2.03–3.43; VS: AOR = 1.79; 95% CI = 1.45–2.21), and absolute time
and proportion of follow-up time spent re-incarcerated were highly correlated with better
treatment outcomes. Limited data were available on changes over time in injection drug use
or other substance use disorders, psychiatric disorders, or housing status.
Conclusions
In a large cohort of CJ-involved PLWH with a 3-year post-release evaluation, RIC dimin-
ished significantly over time, but was associated with HIV care during incarceration, health
insurance, case management services, and early linkage to care post-release. While re-
incarceration and conditional release provide opportunities to engage in care, reducing
recidivism and supporting community-based RIC efforts are key to improving longitudinal
treatment outcomes among CJ-involved PLWH.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
• HIV prevention and treatment strategies aim to reduce HIV-related morbidity, mortal-
ity, and transmission by retaining people with HIV in care and sustaining them on anti-
retroviral treatment to achieve viral suppression (VS).
• Few prior studies had described long-term retention in HIV care (RIC) or VS for people
incarcerated in prisons or jails and transitioning to communities. In fact, incarceration
periods are often excluded from studies of RIC. This is an important knowledge gap
because HIV and incarceration are overlapping epidemics that disproportionately affect
people who are already marginalized by homelessness, substance use and psychiatric
disorders, and socioeconomic status.
What did the researchers do and find?
• We merged statewide databases from the Connecticut Department of Correction and
Connecticut Department of Public Health on all people living with HIV who were
released from prisons or jails in Connecticut, US, between 2007 and 2011. We followed
each individual in this cohort for 3 years after release from prison/jail to examine RIC
and VS.
• Among 1,094 individuals included in the study, continuous RIC declined over time
(67.2% retained during year 1, 51.3% retained during years 1–2, and 42.5% retained dur-
ing all 3 years). Compared with individuals who were not re-incarcerated, individuals
who were re-incarcerated were more likely to meet RIC criteria (48% versus 34%; p <
0.001) but less likely to have VS (72% versus 81%; p = 0.048).

 • Successful RIC and achievement of VS was associated with older age (RIC: adjusted
odds ratio [AOR] = 1.61; VS: AOR = 1.37), having health insurance (RIC: AOR = 2.15;
VS: AOR = 2.01), being treated for HIV while in prison (RIC: AOR = 1.33; VS: AOR =
1.91), receiving case management services during follow-up (RIC: AOR = 1.79; VS:
AOR = 1.31), and early linkage to care in the community following release (RIC: AOR =
2.64; VS: AOR = 1.79). In addition, receiving an increased number of case management
visits after release and spending an increased proportion of follow-up time re-incarcer-
ated were correlated with better RIC and VS outcomes.
What do these findings mean?
• Dedicated resources are needed to optimize people’s HIV care while they are in prison
and to link them to care following release. Although prior studies suggest that prison
provides a temporary window of opportunity to reconnect people to care, sustained
retention in care and continuity of care ultimately require keeping people in the com-
munity longer and avoiding incarceration.
Introduction
Along the HIV care continuum, retention in HIV care (RIC) is necessary for providing antire-
troviral therapy (ART) and achieving viral suppression (VS), which reduces individual mor-
bidity, mortality, and forward transmission [1–4]. Most incident HIV infections in the US are
acquired from people living with HIV (PLWH) who are either undiagnosed or diagnosed but
not retained in HIV care [5–7]. Poor RIC is associated with minority race/ethnicity, younger
age, substance use disorders, and incarceration [8–12], although few studies have assessed lon-
gitudinal RIC beyond 6- or 12-month follow-up periods [13–16].
The US has the highest incarceration rate globally (910 per 100,000 adults) [17,18], with
one-sixth of the country’s 1.2 million PLWH cycling through prisons or jails annually [19]. Yet
incarcerated PLWH are frequently censored or excluded altogether from RIC studies [20]. For
PLWH engaged in community-based care, frequent brief incarcerations disrupt care, and
undermine ART adherence and VS [21–25]. When healthcare is optimized during incarcera-
tion, the highly structured environment can be an opportunity to reengage PLWH in care, ini-
tiate ART, and achieve VS, though this is often unsustained after release [26–28].
While several recent studies have elucidated challenges with linkage to community care
post-release [29–32], the longitudinal impact of incarceration on continuity of HIV care
remains poorly understood. Prior studies of RIC that have included criminal justice (CJ)–
involved PLWH have been limited by short follow-up [33–35], exclusion of PLWH re-incar-
cerated during follow-up [34], recall biases in self-reported incarceration and ART use
[9,21,24], reliance on ART prescription refill data [25], and inability to comprehensively link
community and CJ data [26,28]. Because RIC is currently defined as having a clinic visit with
viral load (VL) assessment at least every 6 months, a window of observation beyond 1 year is
needed to better understand RIC [36]. Furthermore, a more nuanced understanding of longi-
tudinal RIC among incarcerated PLWH is important for the development of future policies
and interventions to address deficiencies within both CJ and community systems of care.

 We therefore assessed 3-year RIC and VS in a large retrospective cohort of incarcerated
PLWH. We had hypothesized that having health insurance and successfully linking to care
would predict sustained RIC, but did not presuppose how recidivism would impact outcomes.
Because we linked all community and CJ data within an integrated CJ system, we were able to
examine “real world” outcomes in CJ-involved PLWH, accounting for re-incarcerations dur-
ing follow-up and HIV-1 RNA levels obtained in both CJ and community settings.
Methods
Setting
The Connecticut Department of Correction (CTDOC) has been described previously [32].
Healthcare within CTDOC is guided by federally monitored clinical protocols requiring VL
assessment within 96 hours of arrival, with continued monitoring every 3 months during
incarceration. ART is prescribed according to national guidelines, which, at the time of obser-
vation, used CD4-based criteria.
Data sources
As previously published [32], we combined comprehensive custody and pharmacy data from
the CTDOC with the Connecticut Department of Public Health (CTDPH) Enhanced HIV/
AIDS Reporting System (eHARS) surveillance and CAREWare service utilization databases.
The eHARS surveillance system is maintained by CTDPH to be >95% complete. In the origi-
nal data analysis plan, we prespecified linkage to and retention in care as major outcomes of
interest (S1 Text).
Study population
There were 1,094 individuals who met the following inclusion criteria (Fig 1): (1) were �18
years old with confirmed HIV before release from CTDOC; (2) were included in CTDOC and
CTDPH databases; (3) were incarcerated at least once for >24 hours between January 1, 2007,
and December 31, 2011; and (4) had �3 years of observation data after release (through
December 31, 2014). For individuals never re-incarcerated, their only incarceration period
was analyzed as their index incarceration. For participants with multiple eligible incarcerations
(n = 538), we randomly selected 1 incarceration period to treat as each individual’s index
incarceration/release to avoid differentially biasing the sample toward earlier incarceration
periods (when fewer resources were available for HIV treatment and care) or later incarcera-
tion periods (with less time to observe outcomes or re-incarcerations). Random selection of
index incarceration periods is consistent with an approach justified in prior studies of hospital
readmissions and avoids inflating the association between re-incarceration during follow-up
and the RIC and VS outcomes [37,38]. Subsequent re-incarcerations were recorded as covari-
ates. Individuals entered the cohort starting on the day of index release from a CTDOC facility
and were followed for 3 years or until death. For logistic regression models assessing outcomes
after 3 years of follow-up, 1,001 PLWH were included, after excluding 93 deaths. For models
using generalized estimating equations (GEEs), the full cohort of 1,094 PLWH contributed
6,227 complete 6-month follow-up periods (prior to death).
Data merging
CTDOC databases were securely transferred to the CTDPH, where on-site data managers
matched individuals to eHARS and CAREWare databases [32]. CTDOC inmate numbers are
routinely reported to the CTDPH by facility nursing supervisors when a new HIV case is

 diagnosed in prison or by eHARS managers as part of routine data management. Inmate num-
bers were thus available for a majority of individuals in CTDPH databases. Rather than solely
relying on inmate number, the match was done using the Link Plus probabilistic record link-
age program developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (https://www.cdc.
gov/cancer/npcr/tools/registryplus/lp.htm), with confirmatory data points including name,
date of birth, race, and sex. The merged dataset was further restricted to PLWH currently liv-
ing in Connecticut (excluding 97 individuals), then de-identified and securely provided to
investigators for analysis (Fig 1).
Measures
Recorded HIV-1 RNA VLs served as the proxy for routine HIV care clinic visits (both in
prison/jail and in the community), which has demonstrated validity in multiple other settings

 and is consistent with core indicators for national HIV surveillance [39,40]. Using national
RIC guidelines, we defined “sustained 3-year RIC” as having �1 VL measured during every
6-month period during the 3-year follow-up period, with �60 days between VLs in adjacent
periods [36]. Because RIC does not necessarily predict VS and because VL was measured at
different frequencies during follow-up, we created a “terminal VS” outcome, defined as having
VL < 400 copies/ml measured within the last 6-month period of the 3-year follow-up [1,26].
Using time period as the unit of analysis, additional major outcomes were (1) “RIC over time”
(defined as having �1 VL measured during a 6-month period) and (2) “VS over time” (defined
as having �1 VL measured during a 6-month period with the last measured VL being <400
copies/ml). We concluded that the use of a binary outcome in accordance with the standard
definitions of RIC would be more appropriate than a survival analysis strategy (which exam-
ines time to an event) and would thus provide more clinically meaningful results. PLWH with-
out VL assessments at least every 6 months were defined as being out of care; missing VLs
were conservatively assigned VL � 400 copies/ml (non-suppression) by convention [41],
which applied to 24.5% (245/1,001) of the individuals and 23.0% (1,432/6,227) of the analyzed
6-month periods in the final multivariable models [42]. VLs were not missing at random, and
therefore multiple imputation was not performed. For example, compared to the 756 people
with VLs recorded during the last 6-month period of observation, the 245 people with missing
VLs were significantly more likely to be uninsured, to have been recently diagnosed with HIV,
to have been diagnosed with HIV during index incarceration, to have had fewer re-incarcera-
tions or less time spent re-incarcerated, and to have had fewer case management visits. There
were no significant differences between individuals missing and not missing VLs in terms of
age, race/ethnicity, or sex. Using the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Populations framework
[43], adapted for CJ populations [44], we examined a broad range of predisposing, enabling/
disabling, and need severity factors as potential predictors of RIC and VS over time. Continu-
ous variables that were not normally distributed were categorized or calculated as described
below.
Predisposing factors.
Predisposing factors included demographic characteristics (sex,
race/ethnicity, education level, and marital status), source of HIV transmission, and time since
HIV diagnosis. Sex was dichotomized as male/female based on available data; there was no
consistent information available on the number of individuals who were transgender, intersex,
or gender-nonconforming. Age was dichotomized at the sample median of 45 years. CTDPH
databases assessed prior injection drug use (IDU) based on the original HIV risk, and time
since HIV diagnosis was calculated by subtracting release date from HIV diagnosis date.
Enabling/Disabling factors.
Enabling/disabling factors included year of release, whether
HIV was diagnosed during the index incarceration, and health insurance coverage (dichoto-
mous; time-varying in GEE models), which was assessed every 6–12 months in the CAREWare
database and dichotomized as yes (public or private insurance) or no (“none”, “unknown”, or
“not reported”); if healthcare or social service resources were used without having formal
health insurance, persons were designated as uninsured. Using previous criteria, early linkage
to care was defined as VL assessment within 14 days after index release [32]. Length of incar-
ceration was calculated using dates and types of movements into and out of facilities and ana-
lyzed categorically. Generally, shorter incarcerations (�30 days) corresponded to jail
detentions, whereas longer incarcerations (�365 days) involved prison sentences. Conditions
of release were categorized as unsupervised, conditional release (e.g., parole or transitional
housing), or release on bond. Because length of incarceration and conditions of release are
closely associated, we created 1 multilevel categorical variable. Re-incarceration (recidivism)
was defined as spending >24 hours in a CTDOC facility after initial release. To fully explore
the potential effect of re-incarceration, we examined it in 4 ways: dichotomous (re-

 incarcerated during follow-up or not; time-varying in GEE models), categorical (number of
times re-incarcerated during follow-up), total number of days spent in a CTDOC facility dur-
ing the 3-year follow-up, and percentage of each 6-month period spent in a CTDOC facility
(time-varying). Case management visit dates were used to create a dichotomous variable for
receipt of case management services during each 6-month period (time-varying) and total
number of case management visits over the 3-year follow-up period. CTDOC provides addi-
tional psychiatric case management services for those with serious mental illness, but these are
not consistently recorded in CAREWare.
Need severity factors.
The last VL measured during the index incarceration (within 90
days of release) was used to determine VS status prior to release. ART prescription during
incarceration was extracted from pharmacy data and coded dichotomously. Prescribed medi-
cations to treat psychiatric disorders (i.e., antipsychotics, antidepressants, or other neuropsy-
chiatric medications), treatment for an opioid use disorder (i.e., medication-assisted therapy
with methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone as brief supervised withdrawal or maintenance
therapy), and treatment of other medical comorbidities were each coded dichotomously. The
number of medical conditions other than HIV treated during the incarceration period was
summed [44]. As previously described [32], inmates are assigned psychiatric need and addic-
tion severity scores on intake (5-point scale) to determine service programming, with 1–2 (no
or low severity), 3 (moderate, requiring treatment), and 4–5 (severe, needing residential or
intensive outpatient treatment). Increased psychiatric need was further assessed by combining
psychiatric severity score and psychiatric disease treatment to create a 4-category psychiatric
need variable (lower severity [score 1–2], untreated; lower severity, treated; higher severity
[score 3–5], untreated; higher severity, treated) [32]. Additional information on psychiatric
and substance use diagnoses was unavailable.
Statistical analysis
To examine RIC and VS over time, Cochrane–Armitage tests for trend were used to compare
the proportion of PLWH with RIC or with VS during year 1, years 1–2, and years 1–3. Chi-
squared tests were used to compare RIC for re-incarcerated individuals and those who were
not re-incarcerated. Among PLWH with RIC, we assessed the proportion with terminal VS
using chi-squared tests. Logistic regression was used to model predictors of 3-year sustained
RIC and terminal VS. Then, we examined each 6-month period of the 3-year follow-up period
for RIC and VS over time using a logit GEE, assuming an autoregressive correlation structure
to account for intra-individual correlation. Observations on the same individual were not
assumed to be independent; rather, the GEE model allowed us to account for correlated release
periods for the same individual and to calculate appropriate standard errors when performing
statistical inference. Individuals who died during follow-up were excluded from logistic regres-
sion models but could contribute any complete 6-month time periods before death to the GEE
models; including the incomplete periods during which PLWH died did not change effect esti-
mates nor model fit.
For model building, relevant variables within the Behavioral Model for Vulnerable Popula-
tions with clinical significance or bivariate associations significant at p < 0.20 were included in
full multivariable models. To minimize the Akaike information criterion and maximize the
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, backward selection was used to generate
final parsimonious models, including variables with p < 0.05. Sex, race/ethnicity, and recidi-
vism were assessed for significance in parsimonious models a priori. Final logistic regression
models were also assessed for fit using Hosmer–Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests (p > 0.05).
Based on tolerance, variance inflation factor, and eigenvalue diagnostics, final models did not

 have significant multicollinearity. Interactions between race/ethnicity, sex, and recidivism
were not found to be statistically significant. Due to small numbers of individuals treated for
opioid withdrawal, this variable was only assessed in GEE models. All analyses were performed
using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute).
Ethics approval
The CTDOC Research Advisory Committee and institutional review boards at Yale University
and CTDPH approved all procedures. Participant consent was waived because all data were
previously collected and de-identified for analysis.
Results
Sample description
Table 1 summarizes selected characteristics of the included 1,094 PLWH. Half (52.3%) were
>45 years old, and most were male (77.0%) and of racial/ethnic minorities (81.8%). Most HIV
infections were related to IDU (72.6%) and were not recently diagnosed (96.1%).
Description of retention in care and viral suppression over 3 years
Continuous post-release RIC (i.e., having �1 VL measured during every 6-month period, with
�60 days between VLs in adjacent periods) [36] and VS significantly declined with each addi-
tional year of follow-up (Figs 2 and 3, respectively). Excluding deaths (n = 35 in year 1, n = 30
in year 2, and n = 28 in year 3), RIC rates were significantly higher among individuals who
were re-incarcerated compared with those who were not within each time frame (Fig 2).
Among those retained, however, re-incarcerated individuals were less likely to be virally sup-
pressed than individuals who were not re-incarcerated; this pattern was consistent across all 3
years but statistically significant in year 1 and years 1–3 only.
For all individuals, only re-incarcerated individuals, and only individuals who were not re-
incarcerated, there was a statistically significant decline in RIC over time (Cochran–Armitage
test 1-way p < 0.001). There was a statistically significant difference in RIC rate between indi-
viduals who were re-incarcerated and those who were not across all time points (χ2 p < 0.001).
Among those retained, individuals who were not re-incarcerated had higher VS rates com-
pared to re-incarcerated individuals at the end of year 1 (χ2 p = 0.021) and year 3 (χ2 p =
0.048).
Individuals with detectable viral levels during these time frames were considered virally
suppressed if their last viral level within the time frame of interest was <400 copies/ml. For
both definitions of VS (i.e., VS at the end of every year and at the end of every 6-month
period), there was a statistically significant decline in sustained VS over time (Cochran–Armi-
tage test 1-way p < 0.001).
Factors predicting sustained retention in care and VS after 3 years
The 1,001 PLWH who were alive 3 years after release (n = 93 died) were demographically simi-
lar to the overall sample, and 41.5% of PLWH met criteria for sustained RIC (Table 2). In the
final model, sustained RIC was independently associated with older age (>45 years), having
health insurance, being re-incarcerated for >90 days during follow-up, receiving >30 case
management visits, and being linked to care or re-incarcerated within 14 days after initial
release. VS prior to release was not independently associated with RIC, although not having a
VL measured prior to release was negatively associated with RIC.

§In 4% of cases, a viral load was drawn within 90 days prior to release, but the viral load value itself was not reported.
These cases were included in the “no” viral suppression category because viral suppression could not be confirmed.
||Medical comorbidities broadly included gastrointestinal disease, cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia, diabetes,
other endocrine disease, viral hepatitis C, hematologic disorders, hypercoagulable states, hypertension,
immunological and autoimmune conditions, neurological conditions, pregnancy, pulmonary disease, renal failure,
and urological conditions including benign prostatic hypertrophy.
¶There were n = 22 individuals whose addiction severity scores were never assessed during their index incarceration.

 Overall, 54.4% of individuals demonstrated terminal VS after 3 years of follow-up (Table 2),
which was independently associated with age > 45 years, having health insurance, and receiv-
ing increased numbers of case management visits. Unlike RIC, VS was not independently
associated with the percentage of overall follow-up time spent re-incarcerated. In addition,
although VS before release and early linkage to care were not significantly correlated with ter-
minal VS, ART prescribed during incarceration was positively associated with terminal VS.
Fig 2. Longitudinal sustained retention in HIV care (RIC), based on frequency of HIV-1 RNA viral testing, and percentage with viral suppression (VS) at 1, 2, and
3 years post-release, stratified by whether individuals were re-incarcerated (recidivist) at some point during the follow-up period. There was a statistically significant
difference in RIC rates between individuals were re-incarcerated and individuals who were not re-incarcerated across all time points (χ2 p < 0.001). Among those
retained, individuals who were not re-incarcerated had higher VS rates compared to re-incarcerated individuals at end of year 1 (χ2 p = 0.021) and year 3 (χ2 p = 0.048).
�Statistically significant decline in RIC compared with initial 1-year rates (McNemar’s test p < 0.001). ��Statistically significant decline in RIC compared with sustained
2-year rates (McNemar’s test p < 0.001).

 Factors predicting retention in care and VS over time
The full cohort of 1,094 PLWH contributed 6,227 6-month follow-up periods, with 77.0% of
periods meeting the criteria for RIC (Table 3). Independent correlates of RIC per 6-month
period were age > 45 years, being diagnosed with HIV >1 year prior to release, having health
insurance, having a short (�30 days) initial incarceration period followed by conditional or
bonded release, re-incarceration, increased proportion of follow-up time spent re-incarcer-
ated, receipt of case management services, and early linkage to care post-release. Compared
with having a short index incarceration with unconditional release (i.e., “time served”), being

Retention in HIV Care After Prison-Release

 incarcerated for �1 year with unconditional release was associated with significantly poorer
RIC. RIC was also significantly less likely during the final 6-month follow-up period after the
index release. Regarding need severity factors, receiving ART and being treated for a medical
comorbidity during incarceration were positively associated with RIC, while no VL obtained
before release was negatively associated with RIC.
VS was reported in 50.9% of the eligible 6-month periods (Table 3). In GEE models, inde-
pendent correlates of VS per 6-month period were age > 45 years, IDU-related transmission
risk, having health insurance, having a short index incarceration period (�30 days) followed
by conditional or bonded release, increased percentage of follow-up time spent re-incarcer-
ated, receipt of case management services, and early linkage to care. Unlike for RIC, disabling
factors for VS were re-incarceration and a medium length of incarceration (31–364 days) fol-
lowed by unconditional release. VS was also significantly better for more contemporary
releases and during the final 6-month follow-up period after the index release. Receipt of ART,
VS, and untreated high psychiatric need during incarceration were need severity factors each
positively associated with VS over time.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is one of the longest assessments of RIC and VS in a large cohort of
individuals with HIV released from prison or jail. Despite HIV being a chronic condition that
requires lifelong treatment, prior longitudinal RIC studies in the general population have not
accounted for the complex impact of incarceration and the unique vulnerabilities it represents
for many PLWH [8,11,14–16]. By comprehensively linking multiple CJ and community-based
data sources, we were able to follow all CJ-involved PLWH statewide, including those re-incar-
cerated. We identified major correlates of optimal HIV treatment outcomes and found that
the impact of re-incarceration is complex and dependent on time spent in facilities and condi-
tions of release. These findings offer new insights into potential strategies to improve RIC and
VS in CJ-involved PLWH.
Rates of sustained RIC and VS significantly declined over time, with re-incarcerated indi-
viduals demonstrating higher RIC rates than individuals who were not re-incarcerated, across
all 3 years. Re-incarceration likely represents “forced” reengagement in care, but was not nec-
essarily associated with VS itself. Rather, the length of time one spent in correctional facilities
was associated with RIC and VS per 6-month interval and over the 3 years of observation.
These findings speak not only to the potential for incarceration to facilitate reengagement in
HIV care within a structured setting that can provide appropriate care and resources
[21,25,26], but also to the potential for re-incarceration to interrupt HIV care. Re-incarcera-
tion itself was associated with worse VS outcomes, which is consistent with literature showing
an association between incarceration, ART non-adherence, and virological failure [21,24,25].
Short-term benefits gained during incarceration appear to be outweighed by the long-term
harm incarceration inflicts on physical and mental health, especially after release [45].
Individuals who were not re-incarcerated and who demonstrated RIC in the community
had significantly higher VS rates compared with re-incarcerated individuals, underscoring the
importance of better supporting community-based RIC through expanded enabling resources
like case management and health insurance and minimizing recidivism, which is disruptive
both medically and socially [46,47]. This finding is consistent with that from a recent study in
North Carolina and Rhode Island showing that PLWH released from prison and retained in
community care (without being re-incarcerated) had similar VS rates to PLWH continuously
engaged in community care [48]. Sentencing policies, particularly for drug-related or nonvio-
lent offenses, should be modified to encourage community-based CJ rehabilitation and

 engagement in community-based healthcare and to facilitate access to post-release resources
like psychiatric and addiction treatment, both of which improve RIC and reduce recidivism
[49–54].
Engaging PLWH in the HIV care continuum during and immediately after release signifi-
cantly impacts longitudinal RIC. PLWH whose VLs were adequately monitored, who were
prescribed ART, or who achieved VS before release had better RIC over time. Also, early link-
age to care (within 2 weeks) post-release was associated with sustained 3-year RIC as well as
RIC and VS over time. Paradoxically, prisons/jails influence longitudinal HIV treatment out-
comes, especially when community-based resources are inadequate. Many PLWH likely bene-
fit from CJ-based services as a safety net as long as these services are integrated, continuous,
and align health and justice priorities. If jail/prison services are comprehensive and coordi-
nated, jails and prisons can serve as highly effective “patient-centered medical homes” [55].
Despite these opportunities, the uneven and often disjointed care provided in CJ settings and
the detrimental medical and social consequences alongside the excessive financial burden asso-
ciated with mass incarceration in the US favor supporting less costly, integrated community
healthcare systems to improve care for PLWH [45,54,56–59].
Having a short index incarceration with subsequent supervised release was associated with
increased RIC and VS over time relative to both short and longer incarcerations with uncondi-
tional release. PLWH with brief incarcerations may not lose their social and medical commu-
nity-based ties [60] and consequently, with post-release support from CJ supervision, may
better reintegrate back into the community [58]. Conditional release may also facilitate RIC by
providing an access point for PLWH to engage in social and medical services, whereas PLWH
released on bond may represent a population with greater financial resources or social support
that improves their ability to navigate the healthcare system [29].

 In randomized trials, transitional case management services for incarcerated PLWH are no
better than pre-release discharge planning at improving post-release linkage to care and reten-
tion [32,33,61]. Within an integrated prison/jail system, and when targeted to those most in
need, case management may require a differentiated service delivery model that caters to
PLWH at highest risk for recidivism. Differentiated service delivery is a client-centered
approach that simplifies and targets key services (e.g., health insurance and treatment for
addiction and psychiatric disorders) needed along the HIV continuum to reduce unnecessary
burdens on the health system [33,34,62]. In the absence of such services, multiple stressors and
barriers to care can lead to substance use relapse, high-risk behaviors, and suboptimal health-
care engagement, such as defaulting from ART, which undermine VS [63–65]. Unlike prior
studies, findings here demonstrate that transitional case management is a key enabling factor
that is strongly associated with RIC and VS. Despite the important role of case management to
facilitate health insurance and community services to improve RIC and VS [32,65], most
PLWH (54.8%) did not receive these services, and health insurance coverage remained low
(56.3%) over 3 years of follow-up. This indicates an urgent need to expand the provision of
case management services both during and after the transition to the community.
When RIC and VS did not significantly improve despite numerous case management visits,
it is likely that those PLWH had multiple severe medical and social needs. Thus, the positive
effect of case management may be masked by the higher baseline need of those who received
these services compared with those who were not targeted to receive case management. Unlike
in Connecticut, most states terminate insurance benefits during incarceration [62], with find-
ings here supporting the need to reexamine policies that promote continuation of, reactivation
of, or potentially new enrollment into insurance before release.
Unlike previous studies [20,56], IDU transmission risk and high psychiatric need correlated
with VS over time. While IDU and psychiatric need were not associated with frequency of
transitional case management utilization, such individuals may have received additional psy-
chiatric case management to link and retain them in treatment for psychiatric or substance use
disorders, which could have improved VS. Also, some PLWH with an IDU history died early
during follow-up, including from drug overdose [66], which limited our ability to clearly assess
the role of current or past IDU on longitudinal HIV treatment outcomes.
Other limitations of the study included limited data regarding post-release housing status
and psychiatric and substance use disorders. Addiction and psychiatric severity scores were
our best indicators for comorbidities that potentially impact RIC in the community. We also
could not fully measure brief fluctuations in insurance status.
Strengths of the study included the ability to follow both individuals who were re-incarcer-
ated and those who were not, for an extended period of time, and to account for many factors
that changed over time, including health insurance status. Instead of using prescription refill
or clinic visit data to approximate RIC and VS, our outcomes were constructed using reliably
and systematically reported biological data and used standardized, generalizable, and clinically
justifiable definitions of RIC and VS. Defining missing VL data as indicating being out of care
and not having VS may have biased findings, but is a standardized analytic convention that
provides conservative estimates [40,41,67], given that a very small proportion of PLWH may
have moved out of state and not been fully measured despite extensive efforts by CTDPH to
cross-check interstate databases. Finally, we minimized typical database linkage challenges
through the use of complete databases (aside from psychiatric case management data), reliable
variables for individual matching, and CTDPH database managers with considerable experi-
ence linking data.
Despite some limitations, this study is, to our knowledge, one of the first to extensively iden-
tify correlates of longitudinal RIC and VS for all PLWH in a CJ setting, while simultaneously

 describing and accounting for the complex impact of incarceration. RIC decreases markedly
after release from prison/jail, but several key factors correlate with improved RIC and VS after
release, including provision of HIV care during incarceration, health insurance, case manage-
ment, and early linkage to care post-release. While re-incarceration and conditional release
facilitate engagement in care for some PLWH, our findings strongly indicate that strategies that
reduce recidivism and support community-based RIC will yield better treatment outcomes
than using re-incarceration as a mechanism to promote RIC in this population. Improving RIC
and VS will, however, require policy changes, including expanding health insurance through
new enrollments and avoiding suspension; expanding and targeting transitional case manage-
ment to those at risk for recidivism and poor health outcomes; aligning community supervision
(i.e., probation and parole) with healthcare by promoting continued care for HIV, psychiatric
disorders, and addiction (which often requires health insurance) to avoid recidivism; and
screening for and treating psychiatric and substance use disorders, and continuing these treat-
ments post-release. Such changes in policy will likely positively influence HIV treatment out-
comes while diminishing the negative consequences of mass incarceration, especially for racial/
ethnic minorities in the US.
