ABSTRACT
....................................................................................................................................................
Objective Currently, there is a disconnect between finding a patient’s relevant molecular profile and predicting actionable therapeutics. Here we
develop and implement the Integrating Molecular Profiles with Actionable Therapeutics (IMPACT) analysis pipeline, linking variants detected from
whole-exome sequencing (WES) to actionable therapeutics.
Methods and materials The IMPACT pipeline contains 4 analytical modules: detecting somatic variants, calling copy number alterations, predict-
ing drugs against deleterious variants, and analyzing tumor heterogeneity. We tested the IMPACT pipeline on whole-exome sequencing data in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma samples with known EGFR mutations. We also used IMPACT to analyze melanoma patient tu-
mor samples before treatment, after BRAF-inhibitor treatment, and after BRAF- and MEK-inhibitor treatment.
Results IMPACT Food and Drug Administration (FDA) correctly identified known EGFR mutations in the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma samples.
IMPACT linked these EGFR mutations to the appropriate FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors. For the melanoma patient samples, we identified NRAS
p.Q61K as an acquired resistance mutation to BRAF-inhibitor treatment. We also identified CDKN2A deletion as a novel acquired resistance muta-
tion to BRAFi/MEKi inhibition. The IMPACT analysis pipeline predicts these somatic variants to actionable therapeutics. We observed the clonal dy-
namic in the tumor samples after various treatments. We showed that IMPACT not only helped in successful prioritization of clinically relevant vari-
ants but also linked these variations to possible targeted therapies.
Conclusion IMPACT provides a new bioinformatics strategy to delineate candidate somatic variants and actionable therapies. This approach can
be applied to other patient tumor samples to discover effective drug targets for personalized medicine.

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE
The advancement of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies
has revolutionized modern biomedical research, especially cancer re-
search. It is now possible to obtain variants from whole-exome se-
quencing (WES) at single-base resolution from individual patients
using NGS. In cancer genomics, recent studies using NGS have suc-
cessfully identified novel somatic alterations such as single-nucleotide
variants, insertions and deletions, copy number aberrations (CNAs),
structural variants, and gene fusions. Determining the functional rele-
vance of these identified somatic mutations in cancer is a prerequisite
to performing precision oncology, which involves matching specific
therapies to individual patients based on their genomics. Therefore,
the challenge for cancer genomics has shifted from the bottleneck of
data generation to data analysis and interpretation.
Several computational analysis pipelines have been developed, pri-
marily focusing on identifying either single nucleotide variants or copy
number alterations from WES data. For example, most of the data
analysis pipelines incorporate variant callers such as SAMTools and
GATK to obtain the Variant Calling Format (VCF) file. From the VCF
files, existing pipelines use a variety of variant annotation tools such
as ANNOVAR to annotate the significance of the variants. These pipe-
lines return the annotated files that users then have to narrow down
manually to identify actionable targets. These WES data analysis pipe-
lines include the Broad GDAC Firehose, STORMSeq,1 SIMPLEX,2
Atlas2 Suite,3 Fastq2vcf,4 WEP,5 and EVA.6 Other analysis tools were
provided in an excellent review.7 In contrast, some data analysis pipe-
lines focus solely on identifying copy number alterations from WES.
These copy number analysis pipelines were recently reviewed.8 Only a
limited number of pipelines were proposed to link candidate genes
identified in WES with therapeutics.9–11
Here, we introduce the Integrating Molecular Profiles with
Actionable Therapeutics (IMPACT) analysis pipeline, which integrates
single nucleotide variants and copy number alterations from WES data
to identify a list of candidate genes for therapeutic targets. From the
list of candidate genes, IMPACT returns a prioritized list of drugs pre-
dicted to target these cancer genes, using our recently published com-
prehensive drug-target database. The IMPACT analysis pipeline also
allows users to explore the tumor heterogeneity of the sample. This

 allows users to understand the clonal dynamics from WES data during
the course of treatment, or comparisons of clinically similar samples
to each other. Taken together, IMPACT represents a novel analysis
pipeline that links raw WES data with actionable therapeutics.
To illustrate the utility of IMPACT, we analyzed 6 different tumor sam-
ples from 2 different types of cancer. Three of these samples were
taken from 1 melanoma patient with a BRAF p.V600E mutation over
the course of treatment. This demonstrates IMPACT’s ability to provide
actionable therapeutics even when the patient has become resistant
to certain therapies. We also demonstrate IMPACT’s ability to predict
actionable therapeutics in other cancers by utilizing 3 samples from
the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma cohort with EGFR mutations.12
MATERIALS AND METHODS
IMPACT Analysis Pipeline
The IMPACT analysis pipeline consists of 4 analytical modules: (1) sin-
gle nucleotide variants and (2) copy number alterations analyses, with
the candidate genes from these 2 analyses used to link with (3) drug
prediction and (4) tumor heterogeneity analysis. IMPACT uses paired-
end WES reads (fastq.gz files) as input, with the option to also include
a matched normal sample. IMPACT returns 2 tiers of actionable thera-
peutics based on the molecular profile of the sample. The complete
IMPACT analysis pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1. The following sec-
tions describe the IMPACT analytical components in detail. Specific
parameters for each module are outlined in the IMPACT v1.0 user
manual, which can be found at http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/IMPACT,
along with the melanoma patient data and software.
(1) Analysis of Single Nucleotide Variants. This module takes
fastq.gz as input and outputs a VCF file containing predicted deleteri-
ous mutations. Sequencing reads generated from the Illumina next-
generation sequencer were extracted and processed by the Illumina
Bustard base calling and alignment program to convert the sequencing
bases and quality scores to the FASTQ format. Using the converted
FASTQ format as the input for this module, the sequencing reads were
mapped to the human hg19 reference exome using the Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner (v0.7.8-r455).13,14 The Burrows-Wheeler Aligner was
run with default parameters for paired-end 125 bp–long read se-
quences. SAMTools (v1.1)15 was used to convert Sequence Alignment
Map (SAM) files to sorted Binary Alignment Map (BAM) files. BCFtools
(v1.1) was utilized to detect variants from the BAM file and outputs
into a VCF file. In the IMPACT pipeline, we used ANNOVAR (v2014-11-
12)16 to annotate the variants. Somatic mutations were determined by
removing the normal variants found only in the tumor sample as com-
pared to the matched normal sample. Synonymous and intronic
variants were removed, along with variants present in greater than 1
percent of the 1000 genome project17 and/or Exome Sequencing
Project (ESP6500). Variants were then filtered based on the 10 delete-
rious predictors in ANNOVAR. The 2 most commonly known deleteri-
ous mutations in melanoma are found at BRAFV600 and NRASQ61 and
were thus used to test the accuracy of these deleterious predictors, as
shown in Figure 2. Six prediction algorithms correctly predicted
BRAFV600 and NRASQ61 mutations as deleterious. Therefore, variants
were further analyzed only if they were predicted deleterious by
SIFT,18
PolyPhen2,19
FATHMM,20
CADD,21
GERP,22
or
MutationTaster.23 To avoid filtering out potential actionable targets, we
also included variants that were present in the COSMIC database and
were predicted to be deleterious by SIFT or PolyPhen2.
(2) Copy Number Alterations. This module takes either fastq.gz
files or BAM files as the inputs and returns copy number changes
from a normal sample. We used VarScan224 as the tool for identifying
CNAs from WES data in the IMPACT analysis pipeline. VarScan2 calcu-
lated the log2 score difference in sequencing depth between normal
and cancer exomes in 100 base pair sliding segments. Fisher’s exact
test was used to determine whether the ratio of tumor and normal
depth changed significantly. Circular binary segmentation was applied
to each target region to merge adjacent small segments into large
segments. Sample coverage for each segment was classified as being

 an
amplification
(log2 > 2),
deletion
(log2 < �2),
or
neutral
(�2 � log2 � 2) event across each gene’s total sample coverage. One
of the caveats of VarScan2 is that it tends to call small segments ei-
ther amplified or loss, and therefore it identified more CNAs.7 To over-
come this, we have developed our own post-processing script to filter
the output from VarScan2. First, the total coverage of each exon for
each gene was calculated. Next, genes that had areas of no coverage
were given a log2 score of �10 to represent a deletion. Last, genes
that had an overall coverage of at least 5000 base pairs and consecu-
tive segments constituting >70% of the total gene length were identi-
fied as amplified or deleted in each sample.
(3) Drug Prediction. Candidate genes with variants identified from
modules 1 and 2 were used as the inputs to link with therapeutics.
We used a 2-tier system to connect genes with therapies. The first-
tier system (Level 1) is to follow the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-
Match
(http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/
nci-supported/nci-match) and MD Anderson Personalized Cancer
Therapy (PCT) (https://pct.mdanderson.org) criteria, where a gene with
known variants with Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved
drugs will be prioritized. First-tier therapeutics also included FDA-
approved kinase inhibitors from DSigDB25 (http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/
DSigDB/), a database of kinases and their targets manually curated
from peer-reviewed literature. Second-tier therapeutics (Level 2) in-
cluded all FDA-approved drugs and their gene targets found in
DSigDB, a comprehensive drug-gene target database for ranking the
potential therapeutics against the candidate genes. For each drug in
the DSigDB database, we used a hypergeometric test and a permuta-
tion test to determine whether the target genes were enriched in the
variants list. Both tests were done on the drugs that had at least 1
drug-target gene from the variants list. Since some drugs target only
1 or 2 genes and can be underestimated (ie, significance overestima-
tion), we resampled target genes per drug 1000 times from the list of
DSigDB FDA-approved drugs and compared common target genes
(test statistic) from the IMPACT candidate genes. We assumed that ev-
ery gene from the database had equal probability to be a target.
Generally, both tests showed lower P-values for the drugs with smaller
numbers of targets, which indicates that more target-specific drugs
are considered as candidate therapeutics. Drugs with the lowest
P-values will be considered as candidate therapeutics. The output
from this step is a 2-tiered list of drugs with their gene targets and the
source they were matched from (NCI Match Clinical Trial, MD
Anderson PCT, or DSigDB). HTML output provides links to the DSigDB
compound webpage for viewing the molecule information and drug-
target genes.
(4) Tumor Heterogeneity Analysis. We measured tumor clonality
and heterogeneity using mutant allele frequency estimates, similar to
what has been published previously.26,27 We compared distributions
of allele frequency estimates using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.28
TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma Samples
We downloaded 3 matched normal-tumor TCGA lung adenocarcinoma
samples from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Cancer
Genomics Hub (https://cghub.ucsc.edu): TCGA-49-4494, TCGA-50-
5944, and TCGA-64-1681. These 3 TCGA samples were selected be-
cause all of them have EGFR p.L858R mutation. The TCGA-49-4494
sample has an additional EGFR p.T790M mutation. These EGFR muta-
tions will serve as the positive controls for the variant detection mod-
ule (Module 1) in the IMPACT analysis pipeline. EGFR p.L858R is a
predictive biomarker for FDA-approved EGFR inhibitors such as gefiti-
nib (first generation), erlotinib (first generation), afatinib (second
generation), and, currently in clinical trial, a third-generation EGFR
inhibitor, AZD9291. However, EGFR p.T790M is a gatekeeper mutation
that blocks the first-generation EGFR inhibitors and only responds to
afatinib and AZD9291. These EGFR mutations and their linking with
therapeutics will serve as positive controls for the drug prediction
module (Module 3) of IMPACT.
WES sequencing
Genomic DNA was extracted and purified from tissue samples using
the Clontech NucleoSpinV
R Blood QuickPure kit. Sequences of the
exome were enriched using the Agilent SureSelect Exome enrichment
kit. The estimated target size of the exome was about 50 Mb, covering
�20 000 coding genes. Enriched exome sequences were sheared to
250–350 bp using the Covaris DNA shearing system. Illumina se-
quencing adapter and barcode (index) were added to the sheared
DNA. Enriched samples (library) were sequenced on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 for 125 bp pair-end reads. We obtained an average 400X
and 200X sequencing coverage for the cancer and normal exome(s),
respectively.
Validation of the Identified Somatic Mutations
Specific mutations in BRAF, CDKN2A, CTNNB1, GNAQ, HRAS, KIT,
KRAS,
NRAS,
PIK3CA,
and
STK11
were
validated
using
the
qBiomarker Melanoma Somatic Mutation PCR array (Qiagen Inc.,
Valencia, CA, USA). This is an allele-specific and hydrolysis probe–
based detection of somatic mutations commonly found in melanoma.
One microgram of genomic DNA was assayed, and data was calcu-
lated using the delta CT method after 40 cycles of PCR.
Patient Recruitment
Tissue acquisition from consenting melanoma patients at the time of
removal of a primary tumor or biopsy was conducted under a Colorado
Multi-Institutional Review Board–approved protocol, COMIRB-05-0309.
RESULTS
IMPACT Pipeline for WES Analysis
We developed and implemented IMPACT as a novel WES analysis
pipeline that integrates 4 analytical modules: (1) variant detection, (2)
copy number estimation, (3) drug prediction, and (4) tumor heteroge-
neity analysis. The workflow of the IMPACT pipeline is illustrated in
Figure 1. The IMPACT pipeline accepts WES FASTQ files (eg, tumor
and normal samples) as the inputs, and returns the 4 analytical results
from each module as the outputs. Users could also perform individual
IMPACT module analysis on their samples. The IMPACT pipeline and
the analytical modules were implemented as a script written in Perl
(v5.10.1). See the IMPACT User Manual for parameters, dependencies
of each module, and instructions on running the program. The IMPACT
pipeline is freely available at http://tanlab.ucdenver.edu/IMPACT.
IMPACT Analysis of the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma Samples
To test the IMPACT pipeline in detecting variants and linking them to
therapeutics, we first performed the analysis on 3 matched tumor-nor-
mal whole-exome sequences of TCGA lung adenocarcinoma samples
(TCGA-49-4494, TCGA-50-5944, and TCGA-64-1681) with known
EGFR p.L858R mutation. One of the samples, TCGA-49-4494, has an
additional EGFR p.T790M mutation. These known EGFR mutations
were used as the positive controls for testing the variants detection
module (Module 1) of the IMPACT pipeline. Moreover, these EGFR mu-
tations have been associated with different drugs: EGFR p.L858R is
associated with responses to gefitinib, erlotinib, afatinib, and
AZD9291, whereas EGFR p.T790M is associated with responses to
afatinib and AZD9291. These gene-variant–drug associations were

 used as the positive controls for testing the drug prediction module
(Module 3) of the IMPACT pipeline.
We used the IMPACT pipeline to analyze the somatic variants in the
3 TCGA lung adenocarcinoma samples. IMPACT identified 21111,
27348, and 18163 somatic variants in TCGA-64-1681, TCGA-49-4494,
and TCGA-50-5944, respectively. Among the somatic variants, 1 923,
1909, and 1399 were exonic and non-synonymous in TCGA-64-1681,
TCGA-49-4494, and TCGA-50-5944, respectively. Among these non-
synonymous exonic variants, 181, 126, and 72 somatic variants were
predicted as deleterious in TCGA-64-1681, TCGA-49-4494, and TCGA-
50-5944, respectively. Importantly, IMPACT correctly identified the EGFR
p.L858R mutation in all 3 samples, as well as the EGFR p.T790M muta-
tion in TCGA-49-4494. As these EGFR mutations have been validated in
the TCGA studies and used as the positive controls, this supports the
idea that IMPACT could identify actionable variants from WES data. For
the copy number alterations, IMPACT identified 77, 76, and 82 deletions
in TCGA-64-1681, TCGA-49-4494, and TCGA-50-5944, respectively.
Table 1 summarizes the number of variants and copy number alter-
ations detected in these samples. The list of somatic variants and copy
number alterations detected in these lung samples is available in
Supplementary Tables 1–3.
Next, we examined the drugs predicted by IMPACT on these 3
TCGA lung adenocarcinoma samples. For TCGA-64-1681 and TCGA-
50-5944, where both samples harbored EGFR, p.L858R was predicted
to link with afatinib, cetuximab, erlotinib, gefitinib, ibrutinib, lapatinib,
panitumumab, and vandertanib as Level 1 actionable therapeutics. All
these drugs except ibrutinib target EGFR; ibrutinib targets BTK. As de-
scribed, EGFR p.L858R is a biomarker for FDA-approved drugs afati-
nib, erlotinib, and gefitinib in non-small-cell lung cancer. For TCGA-
49-4494, afatinib and AZD9291 were predicted as therapeutic for
EGFR p.T790M. Both drugs are second- and third-generation EGFR ki-
nase inhibitors that overcome the gatekeeper mutation EGFR
p.T790M. AZD9291 is not an FDA-approved drug; however, this novel
compound is a potent, orally administered, selective third-generation
irreversible inhibitor for EGFR mutant sensitizing (eg, p.L858R) and
p.T790M-resistant mutants.29 AZD9291 is currently being tested in a
Phase 3 clinical trial for non-small-cell lung cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov;
ID: NCT02296125). IMPACT also predicts cetuximab, erlotinib, gefiti-
nib, ibrutinib, lapatinib, panitumumab, and vandertanib as Level 1 ac-
tionable therapeutics for this sample. Table 2 lists the Level 1
actionable
therapeutics
for
these
3
samples.

 Tables 4–6 provide details for Level 2 actionable therapeutics pre-
dicted for these 3 samples.
For tumor heterogeneity analysis, IMPACT estimated 62%, 53%,
and 90% of tumor purity based on EGFR p.L858R allele frequency in
TCGA-64-1681, TCGA-49-4494, and TCGA-50-5944, respectively.
From TCGA biopsy information, these tumors have 70–80% tumor nu-
clei context, implying the tumor purity. The difference between
IMPACT tumor purity and the TCGA biopsy is about 10%. Taken to-
gether, these results suggest that the IMPACT pipeline is capable of
detecting somatic variants and connecting these variants with thera-
peutics in WES data.
Case Study: IMPACT Analysis of the Melanoma Patient
To illustrate the utility of the IMPACT analysis pipeline in clinical sam-
ples, we performed WES on a series of tumors obtained from a mela-
noma patient harboring BRAF p.V600E mutation. Three subcutaneous
tissue metastases and peripheral blood were collected from the pa-
tient and WES was performed on these samples. The first sample was
taken at the time of diagnosis, before the patient underwent BRAF in-
hibitor (BRAFi) therapy (vemurafenib). After 2 years, the patient re-
lapsed while on vemurafenib, and another subcutaneous sample was
taken at the time of relapse. The patient was then put on a BRAFi and
MEKi combination study (dabrafenib and trametinib). The patient even-
tually relapsed while on BRAFi/MEKi combination therapy after 2
years, and a multidrug-resistant tumor sample was obtained post-
BRAF/MEK combination treatment.
Single Nucleotide Variants Detection
From the IMPACT analysis pipeline, we identified 31 793, 72 408, and
33 732 somatic variants in the pre-treatment, post-BRAFi treatment,
and post-BRAFi/MEKi combination treatment melanoma samples, re-
spectively. Among these somatic variants, 2606, 6378, and 2511
non-synonymous exonic variants were identified in the pre-treatment,
post-BRAFi treatment, and post-BRAFi/MEKi treatment samples, re-
spectively. We also identified 137, 166, and 107 frameshift variations
in the pre-treatment, post-BRAFi treatment, and post-BRAFi/MEKi
combination treatment samples, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the
number of variations detected in all 3 samples.
In this analysis, we focused on identifying exonic somatic variants,
non-synonymous somatic variants, and somatic variants predicted to
be deleterious in IMPACT, as these are the candidates for cancer path-
ogenesis and drug targets. The numbers of somatic variants found in
exonic, non-synonymous, and deleterious were 92, 306, and 39 in the
pre-treatment, post-BRAFi treatment, and post-BRAFi/MEKi combina-
tion treatment samples, respectively (Figure 3 and Supplementary
Tables 7–9). Interestingly, there were only 21 somatic variants found
in all 3 melanoma samples (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table 10),
and BRAF p.V600E is one of the common somatic variants. Only 1
common somatic variant (NRAS p.Q61K) was found in the post-BRAFi
and post-BRAFi/MEKi combination treatments. NRAS p.Q61K has been
previously identified as an acquired resistance mutation in vemurafe-
nib treatment.30 This suggests that NRAS p.Q61K is an acquired
resistance mutation to vemurafenib treatment and persists to the
post-BRAFi/MEKi combination treatment.
Copy Number Alterations
From the IMPACT analysis pipeline, we identified 473 genes that had
copy number alterations, 70 of which were copy number losses in the
pre-treatment sample. Both post-BRAFi and post-BRAFi/MEKi treat-
ment samples had 67 copy number alterations, with only 1 gene
(TCF3) amplified in post-BRAFi treatment, and no genes amplified in
post-BRAFi/MEKi treatment. One notable deletion in the post-BRAFi/
MEKi treated sample was CDKN2A, a known tumor suppressor.
Figure 4 illustrates the CDKN2A deletion in post-BRAFi/MEKi treatment
in the Integrative Genome Viewer. This is an interesting finding, as it
indicates that CDKN2A deletion might be a novel acquired mutation for
BRAFi/MEKi treatment.
Prediction of Actionable Therapeutics
Next, we used the IMPACT analysis pipeline to predict actionable ther-
apeutics for the individual somatic mutations identified in each of the
3 samples. The presence of the BRAF p.V600E mutation in all mela-
noma samples linked to the combination of dabrafenib and trametinib
in Level 1 actionable therapeutics. This drug combination was recently
approved by the FDA as the treatment for melanoma patients with

 BRAF p.V600E mutation. Other Level 1 drugs predicted in the
pre-treatment sample were dasatinib, regorafenib, sorafenib, and
vemurafenib. In the post-BRAFi sample, NRAS p.Q61K (trametinib),
SMO p.R703L (vismodegib), MET p.H676N (cabozantinib or crizonti-
nib), and YES p.G294V (dasatinib) were predicted as actionable thera-
peutic targets by IMPACT. In the post-BRAFi/MEKi, BRAF p.V600E and
NRAS p.Q61K were the only Level 1 therapeutic targets. The list of
drugs for Levels 1 and 2 for the melanoma samples are summarized
in Table 4 and Supplementary Tables 11–13.
Clonal dynamics and Tumor heterogeneity
Next, we explored the tumor heterogeneity and clonal dynamics of this
melanoma patient under different treatments using the IMPACT analy-
sis pipeline. We focused the analysis on the 3 gene variants: BRAF
p.V600E, NRAS p.Q61K, and CDKN2A deletion. Allele frequency esti-
mates indicated that BRAF mutation was present in all 3 time points,
ie, even after BRAFi and BRAFi/MEKi treatment. In fact, allele frequency
of BRAF p.V600E heterozygous mutation was �0.5 in the later 2 time
points, indicating that most if not all tumor cells were carrying this mu-
tation at those stages. The NRAS mutation was detectable only after
BRAFi treatment, initially with low allele frequency, indicating that it
was probably present as a subclonal mutation. After BRAFi/MEKi treat-
ment, NRAS p.Q61K showed an increase in allele frequency, indicating
that the clone carrying this NRAS mutation was becoming dominant.
The total loss of CDKN2A detectable at the third time point implied that
BRAF p.V600E, NRAS p.Q61K, and CDKN2A deletion constituted the
dominant tumor cell population after BRAFi/MEKi (Figure 5A).
We also detected changes in clonal architecture with treatment.
Allele frequency distribution post-BRAFi treatment was significantly
lower compared to that prior to treatment (Figure 5B, P < 5 � 10�3;
Kolmogorov Smirnov test). It is likely that treatment-induced selection
pressure had a role in shaping clonal architecture. Interestingly, both
BRAFi and BRAFi/MEKi treatments led to a gain of new somatic muta-
tions. However, the burden of newly acquired somatic mutations was
higher post-BRAFi treatment (relative to pre-treatment) compared to
post-BRAFi/MEKi treatment (relative to post-treatment). This could be
due to changes in genome maintenance, tumor growth rate, or change
in clonal makeup due to treatment-induced selection pressure. We
were unable to distinguish between the possibilities. Nevertheless, our
results indicate that targeted therapy has an underappreciated role in
influencing clonal makeup and genetic heterogeneity within a tumor.
Validation of the identified somatic mutations
Using the qBiomarker Melanoma Somatic Mutation PCR array, we vali-
dated the mutations of BRAF p.V600E present in the pre-treatment
and post-BRAFi/MEKi samples (Figure 6A). In the post-BRAFi/MEKi
treatment sample, BRAF p.V600E, NRAS p.Q61K, and CDKN2A dele-
tion (Figure 6B) was detected. However, NRAS p.Q61K and CDKN2A
deletion was not detected in the pre-treatment sample. This validates
that the IMPACT analysis pipeline could identify actionable mutations
from WES data.

 number variations from cancer samples. The IMPACT analysis pipeline
represents a unique computational tool to analyze WES clinical sam-
ples where the somatic variants identified could be linked to therapeu-
tic options. The allele frequency analysis in the IMPACT pipeline
provides an option for users to explore tumor heterogeneity in WES
samples. Here, IMPACT was utilized on 3 samples from 2 different
cancers. First, IMPACT was used to analyze 3 TCGA lung adenocarci-
nomas with known EGFR mutations and successfully detected them.
Next, IMPACT was utilized on longitudinal samples from 1 melanoma
patient to explore resistance mechanisms to targeted therapy. We
demonstrated the ability of IMPACT to distinguish between clinically
similar tumors and offer insights into potentially new actionable thera-
peutics and targets.
Early last year, the FDA approved BRAF (dabrafenib) and MEK (tra-
metinib) inhibitors for use in combination for treating BRAF mutation
(V600E or V600K) metastatic melanoma patients.31 The BRAF/MEK
combination has demonstrated a prolonged response duration as
compared to single BRAF inhibitor treatment (10.5 months versus 5.6
months).32 Similar to other targeted therapy, patients initially showed
promising response; however, almost all patients eventually acquired
resistance to this treatment. Resistance mechanisms for the BRAF/
MEK combination are currently unclear. The current understanding of
resistance mechanisms in oncogene-addiction tumors such as BRAF
p.V600E melanoma can occur through mutation of the drug target or
activation of an alternate signaling pathway (escape pathway).
Using a melanoma patient who received treatments specific to the
particular mutations present, we illustrate the utility of the IMPACT
analysis pipeline in identifying the actionable mutations and the thera-
peutics that could be used for treatment. The post-BRAFi sample
carried the highest mutational burden, of which 306 were predicted to
be deleterious by all 6 tested prediction algorithms. The pre-treatment
sample contained 92 variants predicted to be deleterious by all 6
tested prediction algorithms. The post-BRAFi/MEKi treatment sample
only contained 39 deleterious variants. The difference in the number
of somatic deleterious variants between these samples follows a simi-
lar pattern to the tumor heterogeneity pattern of these samples shown
in Figure 5B. The pre-treatment sample contained a biclonal architec-
ture with a median number of variants. However, the post-BRAFi treat-
ment sample contained a greater allele frequency, correlating with
one of the biclonal peaks from the pre-treatment sample along with
the largest number of somatic deleterious variants. On the other hand,
the post-BRAFi/MEKi sample contained a more homogeneous tumor
architecture, corresponding to the other clonal peak in the pre-treat-
ment sample, with respect to the post-BRAFi sample. This sample
also contained the fewest somatic variants.Use of a BRAF inhibitor and
clinical response suggest that a majority of the tumor cell population
was killed off during this treatment. However, some tumor cells devel-
oped a subsequent NRAS p.Q61K mutation that allowed them to be-
come resistant to BRAF inhibition. Only these cells survived, and had a
subsequent lower mutational burden than the cells with a single BRAF
p.V600E mutation, allowing the initial BRAF p.V600E mutation to be
maintained in the tumor population. Therefore, after BRAF inhibition
therapy, we hypothesized decreased tumor heterogeneity and thus a
smaller, more homogenous tumor population was able to acquire the
NRAS p.Q61K mutation.
Through the use of the IMPACT analysis pipeline, we identified
NRAS p.Q61K as one of the acquired mutations in BRAFi treatment.
This acquired resistance mutation was collaborated by previous
Figure 6: Validation of the BRAF, NRAS, and CDKN2A mutations. (A) By using qBiomarker Melanoma Somatic Mutation PCR array, we val-
idated BRAF p.V600E is identified in the pre-treatment sample. NRAS p.Q61K was not detected and CDKN2A was detected in the pre-
treatment sample. (B) In post-BRAFi/MEKi treatment, BRAF p.V600E and NRAS p.Q61K were detected, and CDKN2A was not detected.
This confirms the IMPACT variants and copy number detection in these 3 genes.

 published papers. However, we identified CDKN2A loss as an acquired
resistance mutation in the post-BRAFi/MEKi combination treatment,
which has not been previously reported. CDKN2A is a known tumor
suppressor commonly deleted in metastatic melanoma. In this particu-
lar sample, we believe that the CDKN2A loss is a consequence of ther-
apy, as opposed to a driving force of tumor progression. This suggests
that the post-BRAFi/MEKi combination treatment sample might use
acquired mutation as the survival advantage to resist the combination
treatment. Pre- and post-BRAFi/MEK treatment samples identified by
IMPACT were validated by the qBiomarker Melanoma Somatic
Mutation PCR array.
We suggest that IMPACT be included in the variety of analytical pipe-
lines with which WES data can be analyzed. IMPACT is unique in allow-
ing all 4 of the modules to be customized as well as to be run
individually. Studies focused only on variant detection, copy number al-
terations, tumor heterogeneity, or drug predictions could be analyzed us-
ing the individual modules of the IMPACT pipeline. Linking to actionable
therapeutics module is particularly powerful, as it only requires a list of
variants and/or genes with copy number alterations to be used. The
drug prediction module could be used as a general tool to link actionable
therapeutics for any type of cancer-related NGS and “omics” data.
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have developed IMPACT, a novel computational anal-
ysis pipeline tool for identifying and linking actionable mutations from
whole-exome sequencing of clinical samples. IMPACT is designed to
be run in 4 separate modules, with an optional place for a matched
normal sample in 3 modules. The first module takes in WES reads and
outputs a list of predicted deleterious, exonic, and non-synonymous
variants. The second module requires a matched normal sample to
determine the copy number variation between the normal and tumor
sample. The third module explores the tumor allele frequency and
subsequent clonal architecture of the tumor. The last module takes
the output from the molecular profile determined in modules 1 and 2
and links these to 2 tiers of actionable therapeutics.
We tested the IMPACT analysis pipeline on TCGA lung adenocarci-
noma samples and positively identified the reported EGFR mutations in
all 3 samples. Mutations identified by IMPACT could be linked to FDA-
approved drugs and compounds currently tested in clinical trials as
actionable therapeutics. Using IMPACT, we identified novel acquired
resistance mutations to post-BRAFi and post-BRAFi/MEKi combination
treatment in a melanoma patient. The mutations of BRAF, NRAS, and
CDKN2A in the melanoma patient samples predicted by IMPACT were
experimentally validated. Our analysis revealed loss of CDKN2A as a
novel resistance mechanism to BRAFi/MEKi combination treatment
and predicted potential drugs for further pharmacological and biologi-
cal studies.
We believe that IMPACT, the WES analysis pipeline reported and
demonstrated in this study, provides a new bioinformatics strategy to
delineate candidate somatic variants and actionable therapies. As our
use of TCGA data has demonstrated, this approach can be applied to
other patient tumor samples to discover effective drug targets for per-
sonalized medicine.
