BACKGROUND
Tracking longitudinal measurements of growth and decline in lung function in 
patients with persistent childhood asthma may reveal links between asthma and 
subsequent chronic airflow obstruction.
METHODS
We classified children with asthma according to four characteristic patterns of 
lung-function growth and decline on the basis of graphs showing forced expira-
tory volume in 1 second (FEV1), representing spirometric measurements performed 
from childhood into adulthood. Risk factors associated with abnormal patterns 
were also examined. To define normal values, we used FEV1 values from partici-
pants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey who did not have 
asthma.
RESULTS
Of the 684 study participants, 170 (25%) had a normal pattern of lung-function 
growth without early decline, and 514 (75%) had abnormal patterns: 176 (26%) 
had reduced growth and an early decline, 160 (23%) had reduced growth only, and 
178 (26%) had normal growth and an early decline. Lower baseline values for FEV1, 
smaller bronchodilator response, airway hyperresponsiveness at baseline, and 
male sex were associated with reduced growth (P<0.001 for all comparisons). At the 
last spirometric measurement (mean [±SD] age, 26.0±1.8 years), 73 participants 
(11%) met Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease spirometric cri-
teria for lung-function impairment that was consistent with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease (COPD); these participants were more likely to have a reduced 
pattern of growth than a normal pattern (18% vs. 3%, P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS
Childhood impairment of lung function and male sex were the most significant 
predictors of abnormal longitudinal patterns of lung-function growth and decline. 
Children with persistent asthma and reduced growth of lung function are at in-
creased risk for fixed airflow obstruction and possibly COPD in early adulthood.

Lung-Function Patterns in Persistent Childhood Asthma
I
n persons without lung disease, 
forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) 
reaches its maximal level in late adolescence 
or early adulthood and remains stable for sev-
eral years, a period known as the plateau of lung 
function, before gradually declining thereafter 
(Fig. 1).1 Under the construct described by Speizer 
and Tager,1 the pattern of FEV1 growth and de-
cline in childhood and early adulthood is an 
important determinant of lung function in later 
adulthood; both reduced growth resulting in a 
low maximal level of lung function and early 
decline are associated with the subsequent de-
velopment of chronic airflow obstruction.2-4
Determinants of abnormal patterns of FEV1 
growth and decline are multifactorial and com-
plex, and identification of factors associated with 
the timing of a decline from the maximal level 
requires longitudinal data, which are sparse, 
particularly for persons with asthma, a popula-
tion at risk for chronic airflow obstruction.4-15 
The Childhood Asthma Management Program 
(CAMP) cohort was followed from enrollment, at 
the age of 5 to 12 years, into the third decade of 
life, with at least annual prebronchodilator and 
postbronchodilator spirometry and detailed con-
comitant assessments. The long follow-up offers 
the opportunity to examine the trajectory of 
lung growth and the decline from maximum 
growth in a large cohort of persons who had 
persistent, mild-to-moderate asthma in child-
hood and to determine the demographic and 
clinical factors associated with abnormal pat-
terns of lung growth and decline.
Methods
CAMP Study Design and Participants
CAMP was a randomized, placebo-controlled 
trial of inhaled antiinflammatory treatments for 
mild-to-moderate childhood asthma followed by 
three phases of observational follow-up; the trial 
and all follow-up phases included at least annual 
prebronchodilator and postbronchodilator spi-
rometry (Fig. S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1, 
available with the full text of this article at 
NEJM.org).16,17 A total of 1041 children, 5 to 12 
years of age, were enrolled in the trial between 
December 1993 and September 1995. Inclusion 
was restricted to children with a history of 
chronic asthma who, during a 28-day run-in 
period, had asthma symptoms or a low morning 
peak flow on 8 or more days; inclusion also re-
quired a methacholine challenge with a concen-
tration of 12.5 mg per milliliter or less that re-
sulted in a reduction in FEV1 by at least 20% 
(since airway responsiveness is determined by 
the provocative concentration of methacholine 
required to reduce the FEV1 by at least 20% 
[methacholine PC20], with higher values indicat-
ing less airway responsiveness). Written informed 
consent was obtained from the parents or 
guardians of all the participants.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive 
budesonide (200 μg twice a day), nedocromil 
(8 mg twice a day), or placebo, all by inhalation. 
Treatment was continued for a mean of 4.5 years; 
the treatment component of the trial ended in 
1999, and asthma care was transferred to each 
participant’s health care provider. We found that 
the antiinflammatory medications did not have 
a better long-term effect than placebo on lung-
function growth.17 Observational follow-up con-
tinued for 13 years in three consecutive phases; 
Figure 1. Longitudinal Lung-Function Trajectories.
Possible lung‑function trajectories during the first three decades of life are 
shown; the lung function plotted for each age is the percentage of the max‑
imum forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) in a person without lung 
disease; the maximum value is usually attained at the age of 18 to 30 years. 
A normal pattern of lung‑function growth and decline is characterized by a 
steep increase during adolescence, a plateau in early adulthood, and a gradual 
decline into old age. Abnormal trajectories include reduced growth, normal 
growth and an early decline, and reduced growth and an early decline. The 
red brackets indicate FEV1 criteria according to Global Initiative for Chronic 
Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2 (FEV1 ≥50% and <80%) and 
stage 3 (FEV1 ≥30% and <50%) of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
(COPD), when accompanied by a ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity that 
is less than 0.70. The figure is adapted from Speizer and Tager.1

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
more than 85% of the original 1041 participants 
participated in at least one observational follow-
up phase, and 80% participated in all three 
phases.
Prebronchodilator FEV1 values for persons 
without asthma who were participants in the 
third National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES III),18 adjusted for sex, 
self-reported race or ethnic group, age, and 
height at each spirometric measurement, were 
used as the basis of comparison for FEV1 in 
CAMP participants. NHANES III, conducted 
from 1988 through 1994, examined 7429 healthy 
lifelong nonsmokers and measured prebroncho-
dilator FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC) ac-
cording to American Thoracic Society recommen-
dations. The cohort included whites, Mexicans, 
and blacks, and different equations for predicted 
FEV1 were established for each race or ethnic 
group and sex on the basis of age and height.18
Classification of Lung-Function Patterns  
in a Subset of Participants
In the current study, we categorized a subset of 
CAMP participants according to four patterns 
of lung-function growth and decline: normal 
growth with a normal plateau or maximum not 
yet reached, normal growth and an early decline, 
reduced growth and a normal plateau or maxi-
mum not yet reached, and reduced growth and 
an early decline. Normal growth was defined as 
an FEV1 growth curve that was almost always at 
or above the 25th percentile of values in NHANES 
III, and reduced growth was defined as an FEV1 
growth curve that was almost always below the 
25th percentile, on the basis of visual inspec-
tion. An early decline in lung function was de-
fined as an earlier-than-expected decrease of at 
least two data points from the maximal level on 
the basis of the corresponding normal FEV1 
growth curves in the NHANES III cohort. Pat-
tern classification was subjectively assessed by 
experts according to the overall shape of the 
participants’ FEV1 curve over time. Full classifi-
cation procedures are provided in Supplementary 
Appendix 1, Part 2A.
Graphic smoothing was performed on each 
CAMP participant’s available prebronchodilator 
FEV1 measures with the use of robust, locally 
weighted scatterplot smoothing regression.19 The 
participant’s raw measures and smoothed mea-
sures and the NHANES percentiles for a person 
of the same sex, race or ethnic group, age, and 
height as the CAMP participant at each spiro-
metric assessment were graphed on the same 
plot. Two pulmonologists with asthma expertise 
independently classified the pattern of lung-
function growth and decline on all graphs from 
the same randomly selected set of 110 partici-
pants according to protocol. Each pulmonologist 
also determined whether maximum lung func-
tion had been reached and, if so, whether the 
plateau phase or a decline had begun (see the 
full set of pattern coding sheets in Supplemen-
tary Appendix 2). A participant was considered 
to have no plateau and an immediate decline if 
the smoothed curve immediately declined from 
the maximum level. The pulmonologists then 
compared their classifications to arrive at a con-
sensus classification for each participant. Finally, 
one of the pulmonologists classified the remain-
ing 931 participants. If that pulmonologist could 
not classify a participant’s data, the other pul-
monologist was asked to do so, and a consensus 
classification was determined, if possible.
Statistical Analysis
Our primary analyses were limited to participants 
who had at least one spirometric measurement 
at 23 years of age or older and were assigned to 
one of the four patterns of lung growth and 
decline. The homogeneity of the pattern groups 
with respect to demographic and clinical charac-
teristics (age, sex, baseline lung function, timing 
of the FEV1 plateau, timing of the decline in 
FEV1, body-mass index, and status with respect 
to atopy and allergy) was assessed with the use 
of a two-sided chi-square test for nonordered 
categories (for categorical variables) and analysis 
of variance (for continuous variables). Also, the 
trajectory of lung-function growth was assessed 
according to sex, with the use of two-sided t-tests 
(for continuous variables) and chi-square tests (for 
categorical variables).
The Kaplan–Meier method for estimating sur-
vivor functions and the associated log-rank test 
were used to compare male and female partici-
pants with respect to median ages at the time of 
maximum lung function, the plateau period, and 
the start of the decline in function.20 Multino-
mial logistic regression21 was used to relate the 
four-category outcome variable (normal lung-
function growth [reference category], normal 
growth and an early decline, reduced growth,

and reduced growth and an early decline) to 
explanatory demographic, behavioral, and clini-
cal risk factors, resulting in three sets of condi-
tional odds ratios for each risk factor per one-
unit change in that factor. Each participant’s 
outcome was further characterized by applying 
the spirometric criteria of the Global Initiative 
for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 
classification22 to the final postbronchodilator 
spirometric assessment in early adulthood. The 
exact Mantel–Haenszel chi-square statistic for 
trend was used to test the ordered cross-classifi-
cation of the GOLD spirometric category in rela-
tion to the four patterns of lung growth and 
decline. All statistical analyses were performed 
with the use of SAS, version 9.3 (SAS Institute) 
or STATA/IC, version 13.1 (StataCorp).
Results
Classification of the Study Participants
We attempted to classify all 1041 CAMP partici-
pants; Supplementary Appendixes 1 (Part 2), 2, 
3, and 4 include all 1041 plots for readers who 
wish to complete their own classifications. The 
two pulmonologists with asthma expertise had 
very good agreement on their classifications for 
the full set of 110 participants (kappa 
= 
0.83; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76 to 0.91; 
P<0.001) and excellent agreement in their clas-
sifications for the 101 participants with identifi-
able patterns (kappa 
= 
0.92; 95% CI, 0.86 to 0.98; 
P<0.001); additional details are provided in Table 
S1 in Supplementary Appendix 1.23,24 One of the 
expert graders then proceeded to classify the 
remaining 931 participants. He was able to reach 
a decision for 842 of these participants; joint 
review by the two experts was required to reach 
a decision for the remaining 89 participants. 
Thus, a total of 19% of the pattern classifica-
tions were determined by both experts. With the 
classification results combined for the initial set 
of 110 participants and the remaining set of 931, 
a total of 949 participants were assigned to a 
pattern group, and 92 had undetermined pat-
terns (Fig. S2 in Supplementary Appendix 1). In 
addition, two researchers with pulmonary ex-
pertise classified a different random sample 
of 100 participants and also had a very high 
correspondence between their classifications 
 
(kappa 
= 
0.89; 95% CI, 0.81 to 0.96; P<0.001) 
(Table S2 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Lung-Function Patterns in a Subset  
of Participants
Primary analysis was completed for 684 of the 
949 participants (72%) who had at least one FEV1 
measurement at the age of 23 to 30 years. These 
684 participants had a total of 15,798 spiro-
metric sessions (median number of sessions per 
participant, 24 [interquartile range, 22 to 25]; 
median number of sessions at the age of 23 years 
or older, 3 [interquartile range, 2 to 5]). The 
mean (±SD) age at the last spirometric measure-
ment was 26.0±1.8 years (range, 23 to 30).
A total of 170 of these 684 participants (25%) 
were classified as having normal lung-function 
growth without an early decline. Of these 170 
participants, 26% had a plateau in growth, with 
maximum lung-function growth at a mean age 
of 22.3 years, whereas 74% had not yet reached 
maximum lung-function growth at the time of 
the last assessment (Table 1). A total of 178 of the 
684 participants (26%) were classified as having 
normal growth and an early decline; the mean 
age at maximum lung function was 20.6 years, 
and the mean age at the start of the decline was 
21.1 years. A total of 160 participants (23%) 
were classified as having reduced growth with-
out an early decline; 19% of these 160 partici-
pants reached a plateau, with maximum lung-
function growth at a mean age of 21.9 years, 
whereas 81% had not yet reached maximum 
lung-function growth at the time of the last as-
sessment. A total of 176 participants (26%) were 
classified as having reduced growth and an 
early decline; the mean age at maximum lung 
function was 20.6 years, and the mean age when 
lung function declined was 21.3 years. Figure 2 
shows averaged prebronchodilator FEV1 trajecto-
ries for each pattern group.
Of the 684 participants, 429 (63%) reached a 
maximum in FEV1. For 218 participants (32%), 
lung function began to decline immediately af-
ter the maximum level had been reached, with 
no observable plateau on the lung-function curve; 
for 211 participants (31%), lung function pla-
teaued; and for 137 (20%), the plateau phase was 
completed. Among participants with a complete 
plateau phase, the duration of the plateau ranged 
from 0.8 to 5.2 years (mean, 1.6±0.8); the dura-
tion did not differ significantly according to sex 
but on average was 0.3 years longer in the group 
with reduced growth and an early decline than 
in the group with normal growth and an early

the plateau phase, and decline in lung function 
occurred on average a year earlier in women 
than in men; however, the difference in the 
time to a plateau was not significant on the basis 
of a log-rank test (Fig. S3 in Supplementary Ap-

or ethnic group (P<0.001), interval between diag-
nosis of asthma and enrollment (P

with FEV1 in Persons without Asthma.
Values for prebronchodilator FEV1 in the study participants are group averages and are based on robust, locally weighted scatterplot 
smoothing regression. Also shown are percentiles of FEV1 in persons without asthma who were participants in the third National Health 
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)18 and were matched to our study participants for sex, race or ethnic group, age, and 
height at each spirometric session. Panel A shows the average FEV1 trajectory for participants classified as having normal lung‑function 
growth without an early decline (170 participants), Panel B shows the trajectory for participants who had reduced growth without an 
early decline (160 participants), Panel C shows the trajectory for participants with normal growth and an early decline (178 participants), 
and Panel D shows the trajectory for participants who had reduced growth and an early decline (176 participants).

lung function at enrollment (P<0.001) (Table 1, 
and Table S5 in Supplementary Appendix 1).
Characteristics of the 684 participants with at 
least one spirometric measurement at the age of 
23 years or older, as compared with the remain-
ing 357 participants, are shown in Table S6 in 
Supplementary Appendix 1. Participants with a 
spirometric measurement at the age of 23 years 
or older were older (P<0.001) and were more likely 
to be prepubertal at baseline (P 
= 
0.008) than the 
remaining participants but were similar with re-
spect to sex, race or ethnic group, asthma sever-
ity, interval between asthma diagnosis and enroll-
ment, atopy status, and assigned treatment group.
Risk Factors for Abnormal Lung-Function 
Patterns
Results of the multinomial logistic-regression 
analysis of risk factors for abnormal patterns of 
lung growth and decline (normal growth and 
an early decline, reduced growth, and reduced 
growth and an early decline) are shown in Table 
S7 in Supplementary Appendix 1. As compared 
with participants who had a normal growth pat-
tern, those with a pattern of normal growth and 
an early decline had a higher body-mass index at 
enrollment (odds ratio, 1.39; P 
= 
0.02), a greater 
likelihood of maternal cigarette smoking during 
gestation (odds ratio, 2.33; P 
= 
0.04), and more 
episode-free days during the trial (odds ratio, 
1.01 per 1% change in episode-free days; P 
= 
0.03) 
but were otherwise similar.
Participants with the reduced-growth pattern, 
as compared with those who had normal growth, 
had lower FEV1 values at enrollment (odds ratio, 
0.86 per 1% change in the predicted value; 
P<0.001), a lower bronchodilator response (odds 
ratio, 0.91 per 1% change; P<0.001), and greater 
airway hyperresponsiveness (odds ratio, 0.61 per 
unit change in log-transformed milligrams per 
milliliter; P<0.001); were more likely to be male 
(odds ratio, 8.18; P<0.001); were younger at 
enrollment (odds ratio, 0.55 per year of age; 
P<0.001); had a lower level of parental education 
(odds ratio for at least a college degree vs. a 
lower level, 0.33; P 
= 
0.002); were more likely to 
have vitamin D insufficiency (odds ratio, 2.15; 
P 
= 
0.03); and received more courses of predni-
sone per year during the trial (odds ratio, 4.12 
for each additional course; P 
= 
0.03).
Participants with reduced growth and an early 
decline, as compared with those who had nor-
mal growth, had lower FEV1 lung function at 
enrollment (odds ratio, 0.85 per 1% change in 
the predicted value; P<0.001), a lower bronchodi-
lator response (odds ratio, 0.91 per 1% change; 
P<0.001), and increased airway hyperresponsive-
ness (odds ratio, 0.66 per unit change in log-
transformed milligrams per milliliter; P 
= 
0.008); 
were more likely to be male (odds ratio, 3.07; 
P<0.001); were younger at enrollment (odds ra-
tio, 0.62 per year of age; P<0.001); and had a 
lower level of parental education (odds ratio, 
0.43 for at least a college degree vs. a lower level; 
P 
= 
0.01), a greater number of positive skin tests 
at enrollment (odds ratio for ≥3 positive tests vs. 
<3, 2.42; P 
= 
0.03), and a lower incidence of hos-
pitalization during the trial (odds ratio, 0.26 per 
any hospitalization; P 
= 
0.02). There were no sig-
nificant differences between any of the three 
abnormal-pattern groups and the normal-pattern 
group with respect to the assigned treatment in 
the CAMP trial or the proportion of participants 
who had smoked 100 or more cigarettes by the 
age of 18 years.
At their last spirometric session (mean age, 
26.0±1.8 years), participants with reduced lung-
growth patterns were more likely to meet GOLD 
spirometric staging criteria for COPD than were 
participants with normal lung-growth patterns 
(16% of the reduced-growth group and 21% of 
the group with reduced-growth and an early 
decline vs. 1% of the normal-growth group and 
5% of the group with normal growth and an 
early decline, P<0.001) (Table 2). A total of 36% 
of the combined reduced-growth groups and 
8% of the combined normal-growth groups were 
classified as having COPD according to the 
modified GOLD spirometric criterion of a post-
bronchodilator FEV1:FVC ratio that was below 
the lower limit of the normal range (P<0.001).25,26
Discussion
We classified study participants with persistent 
childhood asthma according to trajectories in 
the growth and decline of FEV1 lung function. 
The identification of these trajectories was per-
formed to match the long-standing model of 
lung-function growth and decline (Fig. 1)1 and 
was informed by previous work identifying a 
plateau phase starting by the age of 20 years, 
followed by a decline starting by the age of 25 
years in outbred populations.27 In the two groups

Each participant’s spirometric measurement from his or her last visit in the follow‑up period was classified according to the lung‑function criteria for COPD staging in the GOLD classi‑
fication. The mean age at the last visit was 26.0±1.8 years (range, 23 to 30). GOLD staging is based on postbronchodilator FEV1 criteria. GOLD stage 1 indicates mild COPD, stage 2 
moderate COPD, and stage 3 severe COPD.
†  
P values (two‑sided) are for the comparison with normal growth and were determined with the use of the exact Mantel–Haenszel chi‑square test for trend.

The new engl and jour nal of medicine
with an early decline in lung function, the mean 
age when lung function began to decline was 
21.1 years for participants with normal growth 
and 21.3 years for those with reduced growth, 
indicating that early decline is an important 
contribution to the long-term deficit in lung 
function that is frequently observed in patients 
with asthma.28 The average participant was fol-
lowed until a mean age of 26.0 years, making 
the determination of reduced growth versus 
normal growth more robust than the determina-
tion of early decline versus no decline; the latter 
assessment would be aided by a longer follow-up 
period.
Among the children with mild-to-moderate, 
persistent asthma in our study, 75% had abnor-
mal patterns of lung growth and decline in 
early adulthood. Many of the risk factors we 
identified for reduced growth of lung function 
have been reported previously, including mater-
nal smoking during gestation,29 reduced lung 
function at enrollment,30 and increased airway 
hyperresponsiveness.31 Among these factors, re-
duced lung function at baseline was the stron-
gest predictor of longitudinal lung-function im-
pairment. Younger age at enrollment was a 
strong independent predictor of reduced growth 
(Table S7 in Supplementary Appendix 1), but this 
is probably because children with more severe 
asthma have more severe symptoms earlier, and 
such children may have been enrolled in CAMP 
at an earlier age than those with less severe 
asthma.
Many studies suggest that asthma may lead 
to COPD or persistent airflow obstruction32 or is 
a risk factor for COPD.14,33 That 11% of the 
CAMP cohort and 18% of the participants who 
had reduced lung-function growth with or with-
out an early decline met the case definition for 
COPD, on the basis of postbronchodilator spiro-
metric criteria at an age of less than 30 years, is 
indicative of this connection. We have previously 
reported that a majority of the CAMP cohort had 
airflow obstruction.34 Our data support the hy-
pothesis that both reduced growth and an early 
decline are trajectories leading to an asthma–
COPD overlap syndrome35 and complement the 
recent observation that in older patients, a rapid 
decline in lung function can lead to COPD.36 
Disease progression from asthma to COPD can 
be due to smoking,37 but in our cohort, smoking 
exposure was too low to evaluate this relation-
ship conclusively (Table 1).
Our study has several limitations. First, our 
results do not establish asthma as either the 
cause or the effect of each pattern of lung-func-
tion growth and decline; they merely establish 
its co-occurrence. Second, a longer follow-up 
period would provide a more accurate character-
ization of the lung-function plateau period and 
subsequent decline, allowing for a characteriza-
tion of the timing and precursors of decline in 
all the study participants, not only in those with 
an early decline. Although we focus on partici-
pants with spirometric measurements at a mini-
mum age of 23 years, this represents a tradeoff 
between including more participants in our analy-
sis and making potentially more accurate deter-
minations of the extent of the lung-function 
plateau phase and subsequent decline. Third, 
additional risk factors, including genetic factors, 
prematurity, childhood respiratory infections, 
and environmental exposures, were not available 
for analysis in the present study but would be 
interesting to assess in future studies. Finally, 
our assignments of longitudinal lung-function 
patterns in this cohort may not be applicable to 
patients with mild, intermittent asthma.
Impaired lung function at enrollment and 
male sex were the most significant predictors of 
abnormal longitudinal patterns of lung-function 
growth and decline. A pattern of reduced growth 
is evident early in childhood and can be expected 
to persist into adulthood. A total of 52% of pa-
tients with mild-to-moderate, persistent asthma 
have early lung-function decline, and 51% of 
those have no plateau phase. Identification of an 
abnormal trajectory by means of early and on-
going serial FEV1 monitoring may help identify 
children and young adults who are at risk for 
abnormal lung-function growth that might lead 
to chronic airflow obstruction in adulthood. 
Whether there are interventions that can modify 
the outcome will require further research.
