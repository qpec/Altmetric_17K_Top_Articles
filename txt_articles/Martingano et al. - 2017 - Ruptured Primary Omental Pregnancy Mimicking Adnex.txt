ctopic pregnancies occur when a fertilized ovum is implanted outside of the 
endometrial cavity. Approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of all pregnancies are ectopic,1 
and it is a major cause of maternal death during the first trimester of pregnancy.2 
Abdominal pregnancies account for approximately 1% of ectopic pregnancies.3 Primary 
omental pregnancy, in which the greater omentum is the extrauterine site of implantation, 
is the least common form of abdominal pregnancy, with a reported incidence between 
1 in 4857 to 7931 abdominal pregnancies.4-7 It is reported that maternal mortality from 
abdominal pregnancy is 7.7 times higher than from tubal ectopic pregnancy, most of-
ten resulting from hemorrhagic shock secondary to ectopic pregnancy rupture.4,8-9 The 
rarity of an ectopic pregnancy in the omentum and the absence of clinical symptoms 
often delay diagnosis and proper identification before rupture. We discuss the case of 
a 23-year-old woman who presented with hemoperitoneum from a ruptured omental 
ectopic pregnancy that mimicked adnexal implantation.

Ectopic pregnancies occur when the implantation of a fertilized ovum occurs 
outside of the endometrial cavity. The majority of ectopic pregnancies encoun-
tered in clinical practice are located within the fallopian tube. Abdominal preg-
nancies represent 1% of all ectopic pregnancies. Primary omental pregnancy, 
in which the extrauterine site of implantation is the greater omentum, is the 
least common form of abdominal pregnancy. The rarity of an ectopic pregnancy 
in the omentum and the absence of clinical symptoms often delays diagnosis 
and proper identification before rupture. The authors describe the case of a 
23-year-old woman who had hemoperitoneum from a ruptured omental ecto-
pic pregnancy that mimicked adnexal implantation. Her omental pregnancy 
was diagnosed through intraoperative exploration and osteopathic structural 
examination findings.

Transvaginal ultrasonography images revealed an 
8-mm endometrial stripe, large amounts of complex 
fluid with internal echoes around the uterus and both 
adnexa (most likely representative of a hemoperito-
neum) (Figure 1A), and a 0.5-cm left adnexal cystic 
structure with focal increased vascularity (Figure 1B). 
Her serum β-hCG level was 333 mIU/mL, and a com-
plete blood cell count revealed a hemoglobin level of 
10.9 g/dL, hematocrit of 35%, and a white blood cell 
count of 19.6 × 109/L. These findings were highly sug-
gestive of a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, and the pa-
tient underwent an emergent laparotomy.
 
An exploratory laparotomy revealed 1500 mL of 
hemoperitoneum and a normal uterus with intact ova-
ries, ligaments, and fallopian tubes. A brownish-red 
encapsulated soft nodular tissue measuring approxi-
mately 2 cm × 2 cm, easily palpated, was clearly seen 
on the left side of the omentum (Figure 1C). The gesta-
tional sac was identified with surrounding blood clots. 
A left partial omentectomy was also performed with a 
wide omental excision technique to avoid leaving tro-
phoblastic tissue behind. An examination of the re-
maining contents of the pelvis and abdominal cavity 
revealed no abnormal tissue. Histopathologic analysis 
revealed focally hemorrhagic fibroadipose tissue, reac-
tive lymph nodes, and products of conception con-
sisting of immature chorionic villi in the supporting 
tissue (Figure 1D). The patient had an uneventful re-
covery, with down-trending serum β-hCG levels over 
the course of 2 weeks. 
Discussion
Primary omental pregnancy is the least common 
form of abdominal pregnancy.6 Abdominal pregnan-
cies are a greater risk than tubal ectopic pregnancies 
because they are usually not detected until a rupture 
has occurred and subsequent hemorrhagic shock en-
sues.10 Before rupture, patients usually present with 
nonspecific symptoms and have vaginal bleeding 
(hCG) level was 433 mIU/mL. The patient denied 
medical or surgical history aside from 2 uncompli-
cated vaginal deliveries, a normal menstrual cycle, 
and no use of contraception, alcohol, or illicit drugs. 
An osteopathic structural examination (OSE) of the 
thoracic and lumbar spines, rib cage, and sacrum was 
performed and revealed that T1-T12 and L1-L5 were 
neutral, rotated left, and sidebent right and the sa-
crum was rotated left on a left oblique axis. No 
Chapman reflex points were identified at this time. 
Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a normal 
uterus and adnexal structures, no free fluid in the 
pelvis, and no intrauterine pregnancy (IUP). The pa-
tient was given the diagnosis of pregnancy of an un-
known location, counseled on the possibility of an 
ectopic pregnancy, and instructed to return for a 
follow-up evaluation within 48 hours for repeated 
serum β-hCG level testing. 
 
The patient did not keep her follow-up appoint-
ment, but she returned to the emergency department 
2 weeks later with severe abdominal pain over the 
past 3 hours. She denied any vaginal bleeding, 
nausea, or vomiting. Her vital signs at the time of 
presentation were stable (blood pressure, 117/82 
mm Hg, and pulse rate, 88 beats/min). However, 
physical examination revealed diffuse abdominal 
tenderness, guarding, and signs of acute abdomen 
with increasing lethargy. An OSE of the thoracic 
and lumbar spines, rib cage, and sacrum was per-
formed and revealed that T1-T8 and L1-L5 were 
neutral, rotated left, and sidebent right; T9-T12 
were flexed, rotated right, and sidebent right; and 
the sacrum was rotated left on a left oblique axis. 
Chapman reflex points were identified anteriorly in 
the intercostal space between the 9th and 10th and 
the 10th and 11th ribs near the costochondral junc-
tion, bilaterally and posteriorly between the trans-
verse processes of T9 and T10 and T10 and T11, 
and halfway between the spinous processes and the 
tips of the transverse processes.

diagnostic results that suggested an abdominal location 
of the ruptured ectopic pregnancy in the current case.
 
Laparotomy or laparoscopy can be used to manage 
a suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Although lapa-
roscopy is less invasive, laparotomy may be the pre-
ferred approach in some cases. In the current case, 
emergent exploratory laparotomy was chosen because 
of the late presentation of symptoms, the hemoperito-
neum, the clinically deteriorating status of the patient, 
and the aforementioned diagnostic findings that sug-
gested an atypical location of ectopic pregnancy, 
causing irritation to the small intestine. Laparotomy 
was superior in this case, as further surgical exploration 
into the abdominal cavity was required and laparoscopy 
may have been more difficult and time consuming be-
cause of the extensive hemorrhage encountered intra-
operatively. Omentectomy was performed via wide 
omental excision because the true borders of tropho-
blastic invasion cannot be completely determined 
grossly. Abdominal pregnancies implanted on a vas-
cular surface have an increased risk of uncontrollable 
hemorrhage during the procedure, and rapid vascular 
less frequently than patients with ectopic pregnan-
cies of tubal origin.
 
Osteopathic physicians may use palpatory findings 
of the musculoskeletal system through an OSE as 
 
part of the diagnostic process. These abnormal OSE 
findings, or somatic dysfunctions, arise due to vis-
cerosomatic reflexes from affected visceral struc-
tures.11 In the current case, the OSE findings and the 
Chapman reflex points identified corresponded to irri-
tation of the small intestine at the jejunum and ileum 
(Figure 2).12 These findings, in addition to the trans-
vaginal ultrasonography images, were suggestive of 
hemoperitoneum, and an ectopic pregnancy of an un-
common location was the diagnosis. Osteopathic con-
cepts in the management of ectopic pregnancy have not 
been well studied. Smutny et al13 state that osteopathic 
manipulative treatment is contraindicated in ectopic 
pregnancies because they are surgical emergencies. 
Nevertheless, this fact does not preclude the use of an 
OSE as part of the initial physical examination and di-
agnostic approach, especially because the OSE find-
ings and Chapman reflex points identified were the first

Evaluation of ruptured ectopic pregnancy. Transvaginal ultrasonography images revealed a large 
amount of complex fluid (*) likely representing hemoperitoneum (A), as well as a 0.5-cm left 
adnexal cystic structure (arrow) with focal increased vascularity (B). Exploratory laparotomy  
was performed with subsequent inspection of the abdomen, revealing a ruptured gestational  
sac (arrow) with surrounding blood clots on the surface of the greater omentum (C). 
Histopathologic analysis revealed focally hemorrhagic fibroadipose tissue, reactive lymph nodes, 
and products of conception consisting of immature chorionic villi in the supporting tissue (D).

control during major hemorrhage is easier to establish 
with laparotomy.14 
 
Abdominal pregnancies can arise as a primary or sec-
ondary event. In a primary abdominal pregnancy, the 
rarest type, the implantation occurs directly on the perito-
neal surface, whereas in secondary abdominal pregnan-
cies, the embryo implants primarily on the fallopian tube 
and is then expelled and reattaches itself on another intra-
abdominal surface.10 Primary abdominal pregnancies have 
been reported on the omentum, sigmoid colon, posterior 
peritoneum of the pelvis, spleen, liver, diaphragm, obtu-
rator foramen, posterior surface of the uterus, retroperito-
neum, and pancreas.15 Although diagnosis of such 
pregnancies is challenging, standards have been estab-
lished by Studdiford to discern abdominal pregnancies 
from other types of ectopic pregnancies.16 The criteria in-
clude normal bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries with no 
recent or remote injury, the absence of any uteroperitoneal 
fistulas, and pregnancy attached exclusively to the perito-
neal surface (early enough to eliminate the possibility of 
secondary implantation). 
 
To be properly classified as a primary abdominal 
pregnancy, histologic evidence of growth of tropho-
blasts into supporting tissue must be identified. All 
other cases should be considered secondary abdominal 
pregnancy.17 The fact that the patient in the current case 
had signs of vaginal spotting on initial presentation 
does not preclude the diagnosis of a primary abdominal 
pregnancy. Careful intraoperative evaluation revealed a 
normal uterus and fallopian tubes with intact ligaments 
and no evidence of adhesions. When the omentum was 
first encountered and found to be overlying the fallo-
pian tubes, suspicion was low for the ectopic pregnancy 
to be located in the omentum because hemoperitoneum 
was present and caused an abnormal appearance of the 
entire omentum. All 3 Studdiford criteria were met in 
the current case, thus confirming the presence of a primary 
omental pregnancy.

Conclusion
Despite the condition’s rarity, a ruptured primary 
omental ectopic pregnancy can present similarly to a 
ruptured ectopic pregnancy of tubal origin, but the 
former has a substantially higher mortality rate. Diag-
nosis and proper identification is often delayed because 
of the lack of presenting signs and symptoms. Ultraso-
nography has low sensitivity, and clinical examination 
findings are often benign. An OSE can be helpful in 
distinguishing the location of visceral abnormality, but 
further studies are required to evaluate the role of OMT 
in ectopic pregnancies and accuracy of the correlation 
between OSE findings and ectopic pregnancies. During 
surgical exploration in which the uterus, ovaries, and 
fallopian tubes appear normal and intact, the omentum 
and abdominal cavity should be carefully examined as 
a potential implantation site.
