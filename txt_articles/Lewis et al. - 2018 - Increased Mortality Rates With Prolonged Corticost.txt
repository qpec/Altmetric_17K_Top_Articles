INTRODUCTION
 
Infl
 ammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn’s disease 
(CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), aff
 ect nearly 1.5 million Ameri-
cans and 3 million Europeans, with peak incidence in the second 
and third decades of life ( 
1–6 
). Th
 ese chronic diseases reduce 
quality of life and overall life expectancy ( 
7–9 
).
 
 
Corticosteroids (CSs) and antitumor necrosis factor-α 
 (anti-
TNF) drugs are the main therapies used to rapidly control IBD 
symptoms. Anti-TNF therapy use is usually chronic, whereas CSs 
are typically used intermittently. However, recurrence of symp-
toms upon weaning CSs can result in prolonged or repeated CS 
therapy. Neither therapy is 100% eff
 ective for IBD.

OBJECTIVES: 
 
 
Crohn’
s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are infl
 ammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that 
compromise quality of life and may increase mortality. This study compared the mortality risk 
with prolonged corticosteroid use vs. antitumor necrosis factor-α 
 (anti-TNF) drugs in IBD.
 
METHODS: 
 
A retrospective cohort study was conducted among Medicaid and Medicare benefi
 ciaries from 2001 to 
2013 with IBD prescribed either >3,000 
mg of prednisone or equivalent within a 12-month period or new 
initiation of anti-TNF therapy, each treated as time-updating exposures. The primary outcome was all-cause 
mortality. Secondary outcomes included common causes of death. Marginal structural models were used to 
determine odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confi
 dence intervals (CIs) for anti-TNF use relative to corticosteroids.
 
RESULTS: 
 
Among patients with CD, 7,694 entered the cohort as prolonged corticosteroid users and 1,879 as 
new anti-TNF users. Among patients with UC, 3,224 and 459 entered the cohort as prolonged CS 
users and new anti-TNF users, respectively. The risk of death was statistically signifi
 cantly lower 
in patients treated with anti-TNF therapy for CD (21.4 vs. 30.1 per 1,000 person-years, OR 0.78, 
0.65–0.93) but not for UC (23.0 vs. 30.9 per 1,000 person-years, OR 0.87, 0.63–1.22). Among 
the CD cohort, anti-TNF therapy was also associated with lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular 
events (OR 0.68, 0.55–0.85) and hip fracture (OR 0.54, 0.34–0.83).
 
CONCLUSIONS:  
Compared with prolonged corticosteroid exposure, anti-TNF drug use was associated with reduced 
mortality in patients with CD that may be explained by lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular 
events and hip fracture.

Randomized trial data directly comparing a strategy of intermit-
tent CS therapy vs. induction and maintenance anti-TNF therapy 
are limited ( 
10 
). However, the evidence base for effi
  cacy is greater 
for anti-TNF drugs ( 
11–14 
) and these drugs sometimes allow for 
CS discontinuation ( 
15–17 
). Nonetheless, CSs, alone or in com-
bination with other medications, remain commonly used to treat 
IBD, in part because of fear of adverse eff
 ects from anti-TNF drugs 
( 
18–20 
).
 
Serious adverse events diff
 er between intermittent CS use 
and anti-TNFs. Examples of uncommon but potentially fatal 
adverse reactions that have been associated with CSs and/or 
anti-TNF include serious infections (both drug classes) ( 
21–26 
), 
congestive heart failure (both drug classes) ( 
27,28 
), cancer (with 
anti-TNF) ( 
29,30 
), osteoporosis and fractures (with CSs) ( 
31,32 
), 
and pulmonary embolus (with CSs) ( 
33 
). However, poorly con-
trolled disease may also increase the risk of death and serious 
complications, further complicating the choice between therapies 
( 
9,24 
).
 
Several prior studies have observed an increased risk of death 
among patients taking CSs for IBD ( 
9,34 
). Th
 e relationship 
between anti-TNF therapy and mortality is less clear. A recent 
group randomized trial compared protocol-driven early combined 
immunosuppression (anti-TNF plus an immunomodulator drug) 
vs. nonprotocol-driven usual care for patients with CD who had 
active symptoms aft
 er 4 weeks of CSs ( 
35 
). Th
 is trial observed a 
32% lower mortality rate in the practices following the protocol-
driven use of anti-TNF therapy, but this was not statistically signif-
icant, perhaps because of the small number of deaths. In contrast, 
Fidder  
et al. ( 
36,37 
) observed a 1.9-fold increased, but not statisti-
cally signifi
 cant, risk of death with anti-TNF therapy. Th
 e TREAT 
registry is the largest study addressing the safety of anti-TNF ther-
apy and did not observe an increased or decreased risk of death 
with anti-TNF therapy, but the TREAT population was composed 
largely of prevalent anti-TNF users who may have already survived 
the period of highest mortality risk, i.e., when patients are most 
ill and are initially starting anti-TNF therapy ( 
34 
). None of these 
studies specifi
 cally compared mortality rates among anti-TNF-
treated patients to that of CS-treated patients. Moreover, prior 
studies have not addressed subpopulations such as the elderly or 
those with more comorbid illness who might preferentially ben-
efi
 t from one therapy vs. another. To address these questions, and 
recognizing the many potential harmful eff
 ects that diff
 erent treat-
ment strategies may be associated with, a comparative safety study 
was conducted of CS vs. anti-TNF therapy for IBD with death as 
the primary outcome and select serious adverse events as second-
ary outcomes.
 
METHODS
 
A retrospective cohort study was conducted among US 
Medicare and Medicaid benefi
 ciaries with IBD. Medicare Parts A 
and B cover medically necessary services and supplies, whereas 
Part D covers pharmacy benefi
 ts, including injectable medica-
tions for adults age  
≥ 
65 years and for individuals with certain dis-
abilities and chronic diseases ( 
9 
). Medicaid is a similar program 
for low-income residents. Th
 is study used Medicaid data from 
2001 to 2005 and Medicare data from 2006 to 2013.
 
Inclusion criteria
 
Patients who had been treated with CSs within the prior year 
and subsequently received either additional CS therapy meeting 
the defi
 nition of prolonged CS use or newly initiated anti-TNF 
therapy were included in the study. New initiation of anti-TNF 
therapy was defi
 ned as at least 1 dispensing for an anti-TNF drug 
(infl
 iximab, adalimumab, certolizumab pegol) with at least 1 fi
 lled 
CS prescription and no dispensing for any anti-TNF medication 
in the 12 months preceding the fi
 rst anti-TNF dispensing. Pro-
longed CS use was defi
 ned as either >3,000 mg of prednisone (or 
equivalent) or >600 mg of budesonide divided between  
≥ 
2 pre-
scriptions within 12 months and absence of any anti-TNF therapy 
during the same 12 months (see  
Supplementary Methods online 
for further details). Th
 e index date was the fi
 rst date that a patient 
met the criteria for either prolonged CS use or new initiation of 
anti-TNF therapy.
 
Th
 e following exclusions were applied using the index date as 
the reference: age <18 or >90 years, <2 prior physician encounters 
with the diagnoses of IBD, indistinguishable IBD subtype (defi
 ned 
as an equal number of diagnoses of CD and UC before the index 
date, the diagnosis on or immediately before the index date was 
not the same as the most frequent of the two diagnoses before 
that time, or a diagnosis of fi
 stula or ostomy any time before the 
index date in a patient who otherwise would be classifi
 ed as having 
UC), <12 months of enrollment data before the index date, diag-
nosis of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer in the 12 
months before the index date, and physician diagnosis before the 
index date with any of the following: rheumatoid arthritis, psoria-
sis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus ery-
thematosus, Paget’s disease of bone, asthma, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, or metastatic cancer. 
Th
 e UC cohort was limited to patients who met the entry criteria 
in 2007 or later as anti-TNF drugs were approved for UC in 2006.
 
Outcome measures
 
Th
 e primary outcome was all-cause mortality that was based on 
eligibility data recorded in the Medicare or Medicaid fi
 les ( 
38 
). 
In addition, the following events were included as secondary out-
come measures: major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), 
including acute myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden death, or 
the need for revascularization; hip fracture, pulmonary embolus, 
cancer, hospitalization for serious infection, and emergency bowel 
resection surgery. Th
 e outcomes were selected as they are common 
causes of death and were included regardless of whether or not the 
patient died. All outcomes other than cancer were assessed at any 
time aft
 er the start of therapy; cancer outcomes were measured 6 
months aft
 er the start of therapy given the biological implausibil-
ity that a medical therapy would cause cancer within 6 months. 
All secondary outcomes were determined on the basis of Inter-
national Classifi
 cation of Disease–Clinical Modifi
 cation version 
9 (ICD-9) and Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes. See 
 
Supplementary Methods 
 for details.

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Risk of Mortality With IBD Therapies
 
Follow-up period
 
Follow-up began on the index date as defi
 ned above and contin-
ued until either the patient died, discontinued enrollment in Med-
icaid or Medicare Part A, B, or D, reached age 90 years, was newly 
diagnosed with other immune-mediated diseases or AIDS, or 
reached the end of the available data. Follow-up of patients with 
UC also ended if they were diagnosed with a fi
 stula, as this would 
usually change the diagnosis to CD.
 
Covariates
 
 
Fift
 y-seven potential confounding variables thought likely to be 
associated with the choice between CS use or anti-TNF therapy 
and the outcomes of interest were measured. Th
 ese included 
demographic characteristics, medications, diagnostic tests, 
comorbidities, and healthcare utilization measures. Year of cohort 
entry was included to account for secular trends. Given the time 
periods of data collection for Medicare and Medicaid, inclusion 
of year of cohort entry also accounts for Medicare vs. Medicaid 
benefi
 ts. Potential confounders were measured at baseline and 
as time-updating variables every 28 days (see  
Supplementary 
Methods and  
Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3 for additional 
details).
 
Statistical analyses
 
All statistical analyses were completed separately for CD and 
UC using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Medica-
tion exposure was unidirectional time updating in the primary 
analysis, such that patients who initially contributed follow-up 
time to the prolonged CS use group could later contribute follow-
up time to the anti-TNF group if they initiated therapy with an 
anti-TNF drug. Patients could not contribute follow-up time to 
the CS group once they met the anti-TNF exposure defi
 nition 
( 
Figure 1 
). Th
 is approach tests the hypothesis that a strategy of 
trying anti-TNF therapy is associated with higher or lower mor-
tality risk even if the anti-TNF therapy is ineff
 ective and is discon-
tinued. Alternative approaches were used in sensitivity analyses 
described further below.
 
Th
 e association between treatment and the outcomes of inter-
est was estimated using marginal structural models with stabi-
lized weights from inverse probability of treatment derived from 
propensity score models and models estimating the probability of 
being censored ( 
39 
). Separate models were estimated for treatment 
at index date and for each subsequent 28 days of follow-up time. 
From the 57 covariates that were  
a priori 
 selected as potential con-
founders, we excluded variables from the treatment and censoring 
models if any cell count for any model was <10. Th
 e other covari-
ates, 36 baseline and 46 time varying for CD and 25 baseline and 39 
time varying for UC, were included in the treatment and censor-
ing models ( 
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 
). Patients with very 
high or low probability of treatment with either CS or anti-TNF at 
cohort entry were excluded to improve balance in covariates ( 
40 
). 
Specifi
 cally, we excluded those with a baseline propensity score 
for CS treatment >0.98 for both CD (10.0%) and UC (19.8%) and 
<0.30 (1.8%) for CD and <0.40 (1.5%) for UC. Weights were trun-
cated at the 2nd and 98th percentile to avoid excessive infl
 uence of 
patients with extremely low or high probability of receiving one of 
the treatments. Inverse probability treatment weights derived from 
the baseline model were used to estimate the balance of covari-
ates between the treatment groups aft
 er applying the weights. Bal-
ance was assessed using standardized mean diff
 erences between 
the groups; standardized mean diff
 erences >0.1 are considered to 
refl
 ect meaningful imbalance ( 
41 
). Th
 e same weights were applied 
to the numerator and denominator of computed incidence rates. 
Th
 e inverse probability treatment weights were applied to logis-
tic regression models to compute weighted, pooled odds ratios 
(ORs) and 95% confi
 dence intervals (95% CIs) that approximate 
hazard ratios derived from Cox regression ( 
39 
). Similar models 
were developed for the secondary outcomes. See  
Supplementary 
Methods 
 for additional details.
 
An additional model with all-cause mortality as the outcome 
censored all patients when they experienced any secondary out-
come event to determine whether these events explained the 
association between treatment and all-cause mortality. Additional 
analyses examined for an interaction between treatment and age, 
treatment and comorbidities, and treatment and insurance type 
(the latter only in CD). Sensitivity analyses, also using marginal 
structural models, were conducted to assess the impact of the 
exposure defi
 nition on the observed associations. Th
 ese included: 
(i) censoring follow-up for anti-TNF-treated patients who dis-
continued therapy and resumed treatment with CS; (ii) allowing 
patients to switch bidirectionally between the treatment arms, 
contributing follow-up time to the treatment that they had most 
recently received; and (iii) using the initial treatment to defi
 ne 
the exposure category regardless of whether the patient changed 
treatment, adjusted for baseline covariates and with follow-up cen-
sored at 1 year. An additional sensitivity analysis considered only 
those patients who received at least 3 dispensings of infl
 iximab or

exposed to anti-TNF from that point forward even if they discontinued the 
anti-TNF drug.

2 dispensings of adalimumab or certolizumab pegol within the 
fi
 rst 56 days of follow-up (referred to as having received an induc-
tion course) and compared these patients with prolonged CS users 
with follow-up starting at day 57 for both groups so as to avoid 
immortal time bias. Additional sensitivity analyses adjusted for 
the average daily dose of prednisone used in the 12 months before 
the index date and used a lower threshold, 2,000 mg of traditional 
CS, to defi
 ne prolonged CS use (see  
Supplementary Methods for 
additional details).
 
Ethical considerations and patient involvement
 
Th
 e study was approved by the institutional review boards at 
University of Pennsylvania and University of Alabama at Bir-
mingham. Th
 e study question was proposed and the study was 
designed, including the choice of outcome measures, and imple-
mented by the investigators. Patient stakeholders provided 
feedback on the study design. Results of the study will be made 
available to the general population through the Patient-Centered 
Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) website.
 
RESULTS
 
 
Among patients with CD, 7,694 entered the cohort as prolonged 
CS users and 1,879 as new anti-TNF users. Among patients with 
UC, 3,224 and 459 entered the cohort as prolonged CS users and 
new anti-TNF users, respectively ( 
Figure 2 
). Aft
 er the start of fol-
low-up, 1,473 patients with CD and 462 patients with UC initiated 
anti-TNF such that overall there were 3,352 patients with CD and 
921 with UC who initiated anti-TNF therapy during follow-up 
( 
Figure 2 
). Th
 e total duration of follow-up time (in person-years 
(median, interquartile range)) was 24,625 (2.5, 1.0–4.8) for CD 
initially treated with prolonged CS, 6,222 (2.6, 1.0–4.9) for CD 
initially treated with anti-TNF, 9,158 (2.5, 1.0–4.4) for UC initially 
treated with prolonged CS, and 1,213 (2.2, 0.8–4.3) for UC initially 
treated with anti-TNF. Th
 e weighted baseline characteristics were 
well balanced between the treatment groups ( 
Table 1 and  
Sup-
plementary Tables S1 and S2 
). Th
 ere was near perfect balance 
on age, sex, race, and comorbidity score ( 
Table 1 
). As expected, 
use of CS during the 12 months before the start of follow-up was 
greater in the patients who entered the cohort as prolonged CS 
users ( 
P 
<0.01 for all comparisons). CS use decreased signifi
 cantly 
in the anti-TNF group during the fi
 rst 6 months and in both 
groups of patients during the fi
 rst year of follow-up ( 
Table 2 
).
 
During follow-up, there were a total of 1,444 deaths. Th
 e mean 
age at the time of death was 67.0 (±16.2) years and 76.7 (±10.7) 
years in patients with CD and UC, respectively ( 
Supplementary 
Table S4 
). Th
 e weighted annual incidence of death per 1,000 treated 
patients in CD patients was 21.4 (anti-TNF) vs. 30.1 (prolonged 
CS); in UC patients, the incidence of death was 23.0 (anti-TNF) 
and 30.9 (prolonged CS) ( 
Figure 3 
). Th
 e risk of death was statisti-
cally signifi
 cantly lower in patients treated with anti-TNF therapy 
for CD (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.93) and numerically lower but 
not signifi
 cantly diff
 erent for UC (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.63–1.22). Th
 e 
results were similar in sensitivity analyses modifying the exposure 
defi
 nition ( 
Figure 4 
).
 
Th
 e association between anti-TNF therapy and mortality did 
not vary by age ( 
Table 3 
, interaction  
P value >0.6 for both dis-
eases). In contrast, when stratifi
 ed by comorbid illness, anti-TNF 
therapy was associated with a reduced mortality risk only among 
patients who had the most comorbid illnesses (CD: OR 0.65, 95% 
CI 0.48–0.88; UC: OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36–1.11), although the test 
for interaction was not statistically signifi
 cant ( 
P 
=0.17 CD;  
P 
=0.29 
UC). A subgroup analysis among only those patients with CD 
within the Medicare data produced nearly identical lower risk of 
mortality with anti-TNF therapy (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.90). 
Th
 e same association was not apparent in the Medicaid population 
(OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.46–2.88), although the CIs were wide and a test 
for heterogeneity was not signifi
 cant ( 
P 
=0.39).
 
Among the CD cohort, anti-TNF therapy was also associated 
with lower rates of MACE (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.55–0.85) and hip 
fracture (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34–0.83) ( 
Figure 3 
). Th
 e risk of 
serious infection, pulmonary embolus, and cancer was not sig-
nifi
 cantly diff
 erent between treatments for CD. None of these sec-
ondary outcomes were signifi
 cantly diff
 erent between treatments 
for UC.
 
Th
 e diff
 erence in emergency bowel resection was not statistically 
signifi
 cant for CD (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.96–1.42). For UC, emer-
gency surgery was more common in patients treated with anti-TNF 
therapy (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.37–3.46). IBD-related hospitalizations 
were slightly more common in the anti-TNF-treated group (CD: 
OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04–1.23; UC: OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.29–1.81).
 
Using a lower threshold to defi
 ne prolonged CS use, nearly 
identical results were obtained for mortality (CD: 0.80, 95% CI 
0.68–0.95; UC: 0.87, 95% CI 0.62–1.22) and the secondary out-
comes, although anti-TNF therapy was now statistically signifi
 -
cantly associated with a lower risk of stroke among patients with 
CD ( 
Supplementary Table S4 
). Similarly, additional adjustment 
for the average daily dose of prednisone in the 12 months before 
index date did not appreciably aff
 ect the results for mortality (CD: 
OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.64–0.92; UC: OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.61–1.19) or 
other outcomes, although the association with myocardial infarc-
tion among patients with CD was no longer statistically signifi
 cant 
(OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.50–1.09).
 
 
To determine whether the increased risk of death with CS 
therapy among patients with CD could be explained based on the 
measured secondary outcomes, the primary analysis was repeated 
censoring follow-up at the time of any of the secondary outcomes. 
In this model, the reduced risk for death was attenuated and very 
close to a null result (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63–1.47).
 
DISCUSSION
 
CD and severe UC are associated with an increased risk of death 
compared with patients without IBD ( 
7 
). Th
 erapy for these dis-

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Risk of Mortality With IBD Therapies
 
In placebo-controlled trials of anti-TNF therapy there was no 
increased risk of short-term mortality ( 
44 
). However, clinical trial 
populations do not refl
 ect the broader use of therapies in clini-
cal practice, oft
 en excluding patients with multiple comorbid ill-
nesses and the elderly. Observational data can extend observations 
of clinical trials to populations who were excluded. Notably, the 
reduced mortality observed with anti-TNF therapy relative to CS 
therapy in this study was largely evident in those with the greatest 
burden of comorbid illness, whereas those with less severe or fewer 
comorbidities had comparable survival regardless of the choice of 
therapy. Th
 is may also explain why the association was more evi-
dent in the Medicare population, given that Medicare is composed 
of both elderly and disabled patients. A small study from Belgium 
also observed that among elderly patients with IBD, those treated 
with CS were more likely to die than those treated with anti-TNF 
therapy ( 
43 
). Th
 ese results, and those of a recent study examining 
outcomes of surgical vs. medical therapy for UC ( 
45 
), suggest that 
prolonged CS may be the least favorable strategy for this vulner-
able population.
 
Whether CS therapy directly increases the risk of death in CD, 
is a marker of inadequately controlled disease that contributes to 
the risk of death, or both cannot be defi
 nitively established from an 
observational study. To explore this hypothesis, this study exam-
ined common causes of death as secondary outcomes. Some of 
the observations were expected. Hospitalization and emergency 
surgery were more common in anti-TNF-treated patients, par-
ticularly in UC, likely because anti-TNF therapy was attempted in 
patients who were likely to require intravenous CS or surgery if 
the anti-TNF therapy was unsuccessful. Osteoporosis is a known 
complication of prolonged CS therapy. Unsurprisingly, higher hip 
fracture rates were evident with CS treatment, particularly among 
patients with CD. Th
 is highlights the need to minimize CS expo-
sure and assess for bone loss in patients who received prolonged 
CS therapy. Among patients with CD, anti-TNF therapy was asso-

the CD population. In placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to 
1-year duration, there was no increased incidence of cancer among 
anti-TNF-treated patients ( 
44 
). Th
 e duration of follow-up in this 
study was longer, but perhaps still not long enough to fully exclude 
an increased risk of cancer with anti-TNF therapy. Recent obser-
vational data have implicated thiopurines, which are commonly 
used in combination with anti-TNF therapy, as increasing the risk 
of cancer ( 
50,51 
). As such, all of the analyses in this study were 
adjusted for thiopurine and methotrexate use as time-updating 
exposures to account for the potential confounding eff
 ect of these 
drugs.
 
 
Despite availability of anti-TNF therapy for nearly two decades, 
this study documents that steroid-sparing therapies are oft
 en 
not employed in usual care despite current treatment guidelines 
( 
52,53 
). Th
 ere were far more patients who met the defi
 nition of 
prolonged CS use than anti-TNF therapy in this population. Simi-
lar treatment patterns, including high levels of use of 5-aminosal-
icylate compounds that are thought to have limited activity for CD, 
ciated with lower rates of MACE. However, the same eff
 ect was 
not observed among patients with UC. Th
 ere are limited data on 
the eff
 ect of anti-TNF therapy on the risk of acute cardiovascular 
events among patients with IBD. However, some but not all studies 
in rheumatoid arthritis suggest that anti-TNF therapy may reduce 
the risk of myocardial infarction ( 
46 
), particularly if the infl
 amma-
tion is well controlled ( 
47 
). Similar studies examining the risk of 
cardiovascular outcomes with CS have come to confl
 icting results, 
with a suggestion that infl
 ammatory disease activity may be a more 
important risk factor than CS use ( 
48 
). Because of the nature of the 
two diseases, systemic infl
 ammation is more common in CD than 
UC ( 
49 
). Whether this explains diff
 erences in associations of anti-
TNF therapy with MACE between the two diseases is unknown.
 
Whether chronic immunosuppression with anti-TNF therapy 
increases the risk of cancer among patients with IBD has not 
been defi
 nitively answered. Th
 e incidence of cancer was not sig-
nifi
 cantly higher in the anti-TNF-treated patients in this study, 
although the OR for cancer approached statistical signifi
 cance in

and limited use of steroid-sparing immunomodulator and biologic 
drugs, have been previously described ( 
54,55 
). Whether this was 
related to the cost of therapy, lack of awareness of treatment guide-
lines, or patient preferences for other reasons could not be deter-
mined in this study.
 
Th
 e study has a number of unique strengths. Th
 e sample size was 
large, particularly for CD, allowing us to study relatively uncom-
mon outcomes and to stratify results based on extent of comorbid 
illness. Because patients rarely discontinue Medicare insurance, 
loss to follow-up was minimized and 99% of Medicare death dates 
have been validated ( 
56 
). Medicare covers inpatient and outpa-
tient care and that from specialists and primary care physicians, 
thereby allowing capture of events that may be missed by exam-
ining only records of the treating gastroenterologists. Follow-up 
time was relatively long with 25% of the cohort having more than 
4 years of follow-up. Although for the cancer outcome even longer

follow-up may be necessary to fully rule out an association, prior 
research demonstrates that patients make decisions by considering 
a 5 year or shorter time horizon ( 
57 
). Th
 e analyses were conducted 
with marginal structural models that are superior to standard Cox 
models to account for confounding by time-updating factors that 
are associated with treatment selection and the outcome of inter-
est ( 
39 
). Sensitivity analysis showed that the association of treat-
ment strategy with mortality was robust to multiple assumptions 
and comparable during the fi
 rst year and with longer duration of 
follow-up suggesting that the relative risk does not escalate fur-
ther with longer-term exposure. Although the sensitivity analysis 
using the initial treatment carried forward was not statistically 
signifi
 cant, the odds ratio was almost identical to that of the pri-
mary analysis, but with wider confi
 dence intervals because of 
shorter follow-up. Th
 e shortened follow-up was necessary as 
switching therapy becomes common with longer follow-up and 
compromises interpretability. Finally, unlike the TREAT registry, 
this study focused on patients who were initiating therapy with 
anti-TNF drugs rather than prevalent users, thereby avoiding the 
potential for bias from depletion of susceptible subjects.
 
 
We focused on patients who were newly initiating therapy with 
an anti-TNF drug. Many of these patients discontinued therapy, 
yet we continued to follow them in the anti-TNF group for the 
primary analysis. Th
 is may have slightly underestimated the asso-
ciation between anti-TNF therapy and reduced mortality in CD as 
demonstrated in our “
as treated” sensitivity analysis. However, this 
more conservative approach to the primary analysis is consistent 
with the decision facing clinicians and patients when deciding to 
start anti-TNF therapy given that only a proportion of patients will

Sensitivity analysis examining different defi
 nitions of exposure. 
Odds ratios and 95% confi
 dence intervals (CIs) are reported for the anti-
tumor necrosis factor-α 
 (anti-TNF) therapy with prolonged corticosteroid 
(CS) use as the reference group. In model 1 (the primary analysis), follow-
up for patients continued until either the outcome of interest occurred 
or they reached the end of the available data. Medication exposure was 
unidirectionally time updating, such that patients who initially contrib-
uted follow-up time to the prolonged CS use group could later contribute 
follow-up time to the anti-TNF group if they initiated therapy with an 
anti-TNF drug. Model 2 was the same as model 1 except that follow-up 
was censored if an anti-TNF-treated patient discontinued anti-TNF therapy 
and resumed treatment with CS. Model 3 is an as treated model in which 
both treatments are bidirectional time-updating variables. Participants con-
tribute follow-up time to the treatment that the patient had most recently 
received. Model 4 used the initial treatment to defi
 ne exposure such that 
patients contribute follow-up time only to the treatment arm that they were 
in at the time of cohort entry even if the treatment is changed. Follow-up 
in model 4 is censored 12 months after cohort entry for all patients. Model 
5 is a sensitivity analysis limited to those having received an induction 
course of anti-TNF therapy in the fi
 rst 56 days of follow-up compared with 
prolonged CS use with follow-up beginning at day 57 in both groups.

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE
Risk of Mortality With IBD Therapies
have a meaningful response to therapy and would be expected to 
remain on the medication for long periods of time.
 
Th
 e study also had several limitations. Despite adjusting for a 
large range of covariates in the marginal structural models, resid-
ual confounding, including confounding by indication, is pos-
sible. Th
 e strongest predictors of death in most studies are age, 
sex, and comorbid illnesses. Fortunately, the marginal structural 
models resulted in nearly perfect balance of these covariates. Th
 e 
claims data used in this study lack details on severity of clinical 
symptoms or bowel infl
 ammation. However, we compared new 
users of anti-TNF therapy with patients receiving an additional 
prescription for CS. Both of these medications are almost always 
prescribed for patients with symptomatic IBD, thus lessening the 
potential for confounding by indication. Additionally, we adjusted 
for markers of disease activity such as use of colonoscopy, cross-
sectional imaging, testing for  
Clostridium diffi
  cile 
, and so on. Not 
surprisingly, the prolonged steroid group had used more steroids 
in the 12 months before the index date as some patients in the anti-
TNF group initiated therapy before accumulating as much steroid 
exposure. To account for this, we adjusted for recent steroid use 
in all models and demonstrated in sensitivity analyses that either 
adjusting for the average daily dose of prednisone or using a lower 
threshold to defi
 ne prolong steroid use, which resulted in more 
similar use of steroids in the prior 12 months (data not shown), 
did not appreciably change the association between anti-TNF and 
the outcomes of interest. It was not possible to adjust for smok-
ing, which is associated with all-cause mortality and nearly all of 
the major causes of death included as secondary outcomes in this 
study, as smoking is not reliably captured in these data. Th
 e risk 
of death among current smokers is estimated to be 1.5 to 2-fold 
greater than in non-smokers ( 
58,59 
) Smoking is also associated 
with more severe CD, but recent studies have demonstrated that 
there is relatively little diff
 erence in the proportion of smokers and 
nonsmokers treated with CS or anti-TNF therapy for CD ( 
60,61 
). 
Th
 us, it is unlikely that residual confounding by smoking would 
fully explain the observed associations.
 
Other residual confounding could result from physician pre-
scribing behaviors or patient adherence to their physician’s treat-
ment recommendations that could not be measured in these data. 
Th
 is would only be expected to explain the observed association 
between CS therapy and mortality if the unmeasured confounder 
was associated both with an increased risk of death and being 
treated with prolonged CS. We relied on administrative data to 
categorize comorbidities that may be imperfect. It is possible that 
this could have led to residual confounding, particularly at the 
extremes of the comorbidity index where the strongest association 
was seen between treatment and mortality.
 
Some patients categorized as CD may have had UC and vice 
versa. Th
 is may have been more common in the earlier years if 
patients with UC were coded as having CD to obtain approval for 
anti-TNF therapy before it was approved for UC. Based on our 
results, this would likely have biased the signifi
 cant association 
observed in CD toward the null and the nonsignifi
 cant fi
 ndings 
for UC away from the null. Th
 us, any misclassifi
 cation of this type 
is unlikely to have led to the wrong interpretation. It was neces-
sary to exclude 10–20% of patients to achieve balance in covariates. 
Exclusion of these outliers based on propensity scores resulted in 
improved balance in the proportion of patients treated with bude-
sonide and traditional corticosteroids in the 183 days before the 
start of follow-up and age. Th
 ese exclusions should not be viewed 
as a limitation, but rather a methodological approach similar to 
randomization or matching that increases the internal validity 
( 
40 
). We selected a relatively high dose of steroids to defi
 ne our 
prolonged users. Th
 is reduced the likelihood that we would mis-
classify patients as prolonged steroid users because their physician 
wrote a prescription for a large number of prednisone tablets, many 
of which the patient never took. Finally, we studied patients with 
government-sponsored health insurance, including those with low 
incomes, disabilities, and the elderly. Many of the outcomes that 
were examined in this study are common to older populations. 
Th
 ere was no evidence of a statistical interaction by age. Nonethe-
less, similar studies should be completed in younger populations 
and those with commercial insurance.
 
In conclusion, this study observed a statistically signifi
 cant 
reduction in mortality in patients with CD treated with anti-TNF 
therapy relative to those with prolonged CS use. Th
 e association 
was in the same direction but not statistically signifi
 cant among 
patients with UC. Th
 e reduced mortality rates among patients with 
CD was potentially a consequence of excess cardiovascular-related 
mortality and hip fractures and was largely limited to patients with 
multiple or serious comorbid conditions. Th
 is population, which 
is rarely included in clinical trials and for whom some physicians 
may be reluctant to treat with chronic immunosuppression, may 
be particularly good candidates for anti-TNF agents as CS-sparing 
therapy.

Study Highlights
 
WHAT IS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE
 
✓ 
 
Intermittent corticosteroid therapy and chronic immuno-
suppression with anti-TNF drugs are competing strategies 
that are widely used to treat Crohn’
s disease and ulcerative 
colitis. 
 
✓ 
 
Anti-TNF drugs may increase the risk of serious and oppor-
tunistic infections, congestive heart failure, malignancies, 
and other serious adverse outcomes. 
 
✓ 
 
Corticosteroids may increase the risk of serious and oppor-
tunistic infections, congestive heart failure, fractures, and 
other serious adverse outcomes. 
 
WHAT IS NEW HERE
 
✓ 
 
Among patients recently treated with corticosteroids, rela-
tive to initiation of therapy with anti-TNF drugs, prolonged 
treatment with corticosteroids for Crohn’
s disease is associ-
ated with higher mortality rates. 
 
✓ 
 
The higher mortality rates are most evident in patients with 
serious comorbid illnesses in addition to Crohn’
s disease 
and are at least partly explained by higher rates of major 
cardiovascular outcomes and hip fractures among patients 
treated with corticosteroids.
