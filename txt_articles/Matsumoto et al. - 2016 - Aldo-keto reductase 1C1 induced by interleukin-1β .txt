In treating bladder cancer, determining the molecular mechanisms of tumor invasion, metastasis, 
and drug resistance are urgent to improving long-term patient survival. One of the metabolic 
enzymes, aldo-keto reductase 1C1 (AKR1C1), plays an essential role in cancer invasion/metastasis 
and chemoresistance. In orthotopic xenograft models of a human bladder cancer cell line, UM-UC-3, 
metastatic sublines were established from tumors in the liver, lung, and bone. These cells possessed 
elevated levels of EMT-associated markers, such as Snail, Slug, or CD44, and exhibited enhanced 
invasion. By microarray analysis, AKR1C1 was found to be up-regulated in metastatic lesions, which 
was verified in metastatic human bladder cancer specimens. Decreased invasion caused by AKR1C1 
knockdown suggests a novel role of AKR1C1 in cancer invasion, which is probably due to the regulation 
of Rac1, Src, or Akt. An inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-1β, was found to increase AKR1C1 in bladder 
cancer cell lines. One particular non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, flufenamic acid, antagonized 
AKR1C1 and decreased the cisplatin-resistance and invasion potential of metastatic sublines. These 
data uncover the crucial role of AKR1C1 in regulating both metastasis and drug resistance; as a result, 
AKR1C1 should be a potent molecular target in invasive bladder cancer treatment.
Bladder cancer is the seventh most common cancer and ninth leading cause of cancer death in males world-
wide1. Bladder cancers are clinically divided into two types, non-muscle-invasive bladder cancers (NMIBCs) with 
5-year survival rates of 90% and muscle-invasive bladder cancers (MIBCs) with poor prognoses. MIBC frequently 
exhibits distant metastasis, resulting in 5-year survival rates of less than 6%. As a result, the development of a new 
therapy to inhibit cancer invasion and metastasis is urgently needed.
The differential molecular machinery involved in NMIBC and MIBC has been established. NMIBCs possess 
a diploid karyotype and MIBCs exhibit aneuploidy and genomic alterations, such as chromothripsis2. In the early 
stage of NMIBC, FGF receptor 3 mutation and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) for chromosome 9 can frequently 
be observed3, which is followed by additional mutations of PI 3-kinase (PI3K), cyclin D1, or H-Ras4. In MIBC, 
overexpression and mutation of ERBB2 and EGFR have frequently been demonstrated5,6. The cancer genome 
atlas (TCGA) analysis revealed four MIBC groups according to mutation and expression profiles that are closely 
related to tumor suppressors, including p53/Rb, histone modification, SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling, and 
receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK)/Ras/PI3K such as the FGFR3-TACC3 fusion gene7.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is known to be the initial step of invasion and metastasis in 
bladder cancer, and this process is related to cancer stemness8,9. Several transcription factors, such as Snail, Slug, 
Twist, and ZEB1, are involved in the EMT features that define decreased E-cadherin expression and elevated 
N-cadherin, fibronectin, and MMP2 levels, resulting in the acquisition of specific mesenchymal morphology and 
function10,11. ZEB1 is particularly known as a target of miR200, which is reportedly down-regulated in bladder 
cancer12. The tumor microenvironment, which consists of fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and tumor-associated 
macrophages, contributes to EMT through producing TGF-β 
, FGF and IL1-β 
13,14.
BCG administration is standard therapy for NMIBCs, and neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation ther-
apy may be used for MIBCs. The current results of clinical trials suggest that a combination protocol of paclitaxel, 
radiation and an anti-ERBB2 antibody may be effective for treating localized bladder cancer15,16. The most com-
mon sites of bladder cancer metastasis are the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bone17; no significant efficacy of 
molecular targeted therapy has been reported in these metastatic sites16. In practice, the treatment options for 
metastatic bladder cancer are limited to a cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimen18.
Various metabolic enzymes are involved in the initiation, progression, and prognosis of human cancers19. 
Aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C1 (AKR1C1) is involved in maintaining steroid hormone homeosta-
sis, prostaglandin metabolism, and metabolic activation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons20,21. Transforming 
potentials of the AKR1C family in NIH3T3 cells have been reported22, and AKR1C2 overexpression is a high-risk 
factor for bladder cancer23. As the AKR1C family is involved in chemotherapy resistance in various cancers, 
including stomach, colon, lung, and brain cancers24–27, this molecule may play a key role in bladder cancer.
Murine models are potentially useful systems for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the 
invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance associated with bladder cancer aggressiveness. One of the most useful 
models involves orthotopic inoculation of bladder cancer cell lines into the mucosal membrane through the 
urethra28,29. Using bladder cancer cells that are genetically labeled with luciferase, a single metastatic cell can 
be monitored in vivo and a metastatic subpopulation can be purified30. Using this orthotopic xenograft murine 
model, we investigated the molecular mechanism of bladder cancer metastasis for identifying a therapeutic can-
didate reagent.
Results
Establishment of primary and metastatic cancer cells by orthotopic human bladder cancer 
xenograft. 
To investigate the molecular mechanisms of bladder cancer metastasis, we established an ortho-
topic xenograft model using human bladder cancer UM-UC-3 cells that were stably expressing firefly luciferase 
2 and tdTomato red fluorescent protein (designated as UM-UC-3-tdTomato-luc2). The cells were inoculated 
into the bladders of two nude mice through a urethral catheter, and the labeled cancer cells were successfully 
detected by bioluminescent imaging (BLI) (Fig. 1a). The primary bladder xenograft gradually grew and after 
45 days, metastatic tumors could be detected in the lungs, liver, bone, and lymph nodes (Fig. 1a,b), which were 
confirmed histologically (Fig. 1c). A significant increase in the invasiveness of the UM-UC-3-bladder, UM-UC-
3-lung, and UM-UC-3-liver cells was observed compared with the parental cells (control) (Fig. 1d), which is 
similar to the increased motility according to the chemotaxis assay (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The growth rates of 
these sublines were approximately equal, except for the UM-UC-3-bone cell line, which displayed slower growth 
(Supplementary Fig. 1b). Kaplan-Meier analysis of the mice with orthotopically implanted UM-UC-3-lung 
(n = 
 5) and UM-UC-3-liver (n = 
 4) cells demonstrated significantly worse survival than those with the control 
cells (n = 
 8, P < 
 0.01; Fig. 1e, Supplementary Fig. 1c), suggesting the metastatic tumors have aggressive features. 
It should be noted that metastatic bladder cancer models could not be established using the other bladder cancer 
cell lines J82 and TCC-SUP (Supplementary Fig. 1d).
AKR1C1 and EMT- and stemness-related genes were increased in metastatic cancer cells. 
As 
invasive potential and aggressiveness were increased in the metastatic cancer cells, we next investigated the 
role of EMT and the stemness profile in metastatic cell lines. Immunoblot analysis revealed that the UM-UC-
3-bladder cells had higher expression levels of Snail and fibronectin, EMT markers, compared with the control 
cells (Fig. 2a). An increase in the fibronectin expression level was also observed in all metastatic sublines, whereas 
the UM-UC-3-bone cells had additional enhancement of Slug and N-cadherin (Fig. 2a). To verify EMT, the 
vimentin expression levels were increased in lung and liver micrometastatic tumor cells compared to primary 
bladder cancer according to immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2b). The expression levels of MMP-2 and stemness 
markers, such as Nanog and CD44, were also increased in the three metastatic cell lines (Fig. 2c,d). To assess their 
stemness features, decreased mRNA levels of cytokeratin CK18 and increased mRNA levels of p63 were observed 
by microarray analysis (data not shown).
To identify the molecules responsible for bladder cancer metastasis, gene expression profiles were investigated 
by microarray analysis using the control UM-UC-3 line, the primary UM-UC-3-bladder line, and three met-
astatic UM-UC-3 sublines. Increased expression levels of EMT-related molecules, such as Slug, Zeb2, MMP-3, 
MMP-1, TGFBR1, BMP2, and NRP1; metastasis-related cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, Cox2, IL-1β 
, and CXCR7; 
and other metastasis-related genes, such as VEGFA, EGF, CD74, and CD24, were observed in the primary and 
metastatic tumors (Fig. 2e). We focused on the genes that are commonly up-regulated more than two-fold in all 
three metastatic tumor cells compared with the primary bladder tumor-derived cells (Fig. 3a), and eight genes 
were identified (Fig. 3b). Among them, increased mRNA expression of aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C1 
(AKR1C1) was confirmed in metastatic sublines by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3c), whereas the levels of other genes were not 
significantly elevated (Supplementary Fig. 2a,b). The expression levels of the AKR1C1 protein were also elevated 
in the metastatic tumors, particularly in UM-UC-3-liver and UM-UC-3-bone cells (Fig. 3d). The AKR1C1 expres-
sion level in primary bladder tumors was elevated 2.4-fold compared to that in control cells (Fig. 3e).

IL-1β induces AKR1C1 expression and elimination of AKR1C1 decreases UM-UC-3 cell invasion. 
 
Next, the molecular mechanisms underlying the increased AKR1C1 expression levels were analyzed. We focused 
on IL-1β 
, IL-6, and TGF-β 
1 because these are well-known cancer progression-related factors for many malig-
nancy types, including bladder cancer14. The qRT-PCR analyses confirmed that the IL-1 and IL-6 expression levels 
and those of their corresponding receptors were increased in metastatic tumors (Fig. 4a,b). To assess a potential

role for these factors in AKR1C1 expression, control UM-UC-3 cells were treated with IL-6 (10 ng/mL), IL-1β 
(20 ng/mL), or TGF-β 
1 (5 ng/mL), and qRT-PCR was used to confirm the up-regulation of AKR1C1 mRNA in 
response to IL-6 and IL-1β 
 stimulation (Fig. 4c). For verification, the cytokine effects on other bladder cancer 
cell lines, such as TCC-SUP and 5637, were examined, and IL-1β 
 increased the AKR1C1 levels in both cell lines 
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
To examine the role for AKR1C1 in bladder cancer metastasis, we eliminated AKR1C1 in the UM-UC-3 cells 
using a siRNA technique. The knockdown efficiency of AKR1C1 was validated by both the mRNA and protein 
levels (Fig. 4d). UM-UC-3-liver cells had a spindle shape, suggesting mesenchymal features, whereas the AKR1C1 
knockdown cells had a flat, cobblestone-like morphology (Fig. 4e). A Matrigel invasion assay demonstrated that 
the numbers of invading cells were significantly reduced by AKR1C1 knockdown in the control UM-UC-3, 
UM-UC-3-bladder, and UM-UC-3-liver cells (Fig. 4f). As the enzymatic activity of AKR1C3 has been shown 
to be suppressed by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)31, we tested the effect of one NSAID, 
flufenamic acid (FFA), and found that the invasion potential was significantly suppressed in the control and 
metastatic UM-UC-3 cells (Fig. 4f). Similar results were obtained using another siRNA for AKR1C1 (si-AKR1C1 
#2, Supplementary Fig. 4a–c). Notably, siRNA-based AKR1C1 depletion remarkably diminished the expression 
of Rac1 and phosphorylation levels of Akt (S473), Src (Y416), and FAK (Y397) in the metastatic UM-UC-3-liver 
cells (Fig. 4g) in addition to numbers of focal adhesion like paxillin (Fig. 4h, Supplementary Fig. 4d), which might

indicate a possible role for AKR1C1 in regulating actin cytoskeleton and forming focal adhesion contacts in blad-
der cancer via Src/FAK/Rac1 complexes.
Inhibition of AKR1C activity reversed cisplatin resistance in metastatic bladder cancer 
cells. 
Overexpression of AKR1C isoforms, AKR1C1, AKR1C2, and AKR1C3, is associated with drug resist-

interest to evaluate the role of AKR1C isoforms in the chemotherapeutic response of cisplatin in bladder can-
cer cells. In the UM-UC-3, 5637, and J82 cell lines, long-term treatment with cisplatin significantly increased 
the expression levels of all AKR1C isoforms (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 5a,b), although the basal AKR1C1 
expression levels were different among these cells (Supplementary Fig. 5c). For the orthotopic xenograft model, 
the metastatic tumor cells, particularly the liver and bone cells, possessed significantly higher expression levels of 
AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 (Figs 3c and 5b), corresponding with increased cisplatin resistance (Fig. 5c,d). 
Furthermore, the pharmacological AKR1C inhibitor, FFA, significantly restored the sensitivity of the metastatic 
tumor cells (liver and bone) to cisplatin (Fig. 5e), suggesting a requirement of AKR1C enzymatic activity for cis-
platin resistance. These results illustrate that AKR1C1 confers chemoresistance to cisplatin, and FFA can suppress 
AKR1C1-dependent resistance in metastatic cells, resulting in increased sensitivity to chemotherapy.
Enhancement of AKR1C1 expression in metastatic human bladder cancer lesions. 
To ensure 
clinical significance, we examined the AKR1C1 levels using surgically resected specimens derived from bladder 
cancer patients, including 33 primary and 5 metastatic lesions involving the lymph nodes (n = 
 3), lungs (n = 
 1), 
and liver (n = 
 1). RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that the metastatic tumors exhibited higher levels of AKR1C1 
mRNA compared with the primary sites (P = 0.008; Supplementary Fig. 6). For verification, immunohistochem-
ical analysis was performed using 25 matched-paired samples of primary and metastatic human bladder cancer 
lesions (Supplementary Table 2). The AKR1C1 expression level was evaluated as the sum of the intensity score 
(0–3) and the proportion score (0–3) for AKR1C1 immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 7a,b). In 17 out of 25 
cases, higher AKR1C1 expression was observed in the metastatic lesions affecting the lymph nodes, lung, and 
liver compared with the paired primary tumors (Fig. 6a–c and Supplementary Fig. 7c).
Discussion
To advance human bladder cancer treatment, it is necessary to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying 
tumor invasion, metastasis, and drug resistance. In this study, we evaluated orthotopic mouse xenograft models in 
which cancer cells were inoculated through the urethra. The cells spontaneously attached to the bladder mucosa 
surface and formed solid tumors, resulting in natural tumor growth and metastasis to other organs. We utilized 
the bladder cancer cell line, UM-UC-3, possessing a typical MIBC gene profile with LOH of chromosome 9, p53 
mutation, and ERBB2 overexpression without FGFR3 mutation32,33. In our model, circulating cancer cells were 
observed in the bloodstream of the mice34, and we could establish three metastatic sublines from the nodules 
found in the lungs, liver, and bone.
In these three cell lines, EMT markers, including Snail, Slug, ZEB2, N-cadherin, and vimentin, were elevated 
and had increased in vitro invasion potential (Figs 1d and 2a,b,e). Injected bladder cancer cells grown in the 
mucosa also exhibited enhanced invasiveness with their EMT profiles compared to wild type UC-UM-3 cells. 
Cancer stem cells also play a major role in tumor recurrence and metastasis in various cancers, including bladder 
cancer35,36. In our xenograft model, CD44 and Nanog, as stemness markers, were significantly up-regulated in 
the lung metastatic subline compared with the control cells (Fig. 2d). As ERBB2 is frequently overexpressed in 
metastatic lesions37, mild enhancement of ERBB2 was observed in all three metastatic cell lines by microarray 
analysis (data not shown).
The UM-UC-3-lung and UM-UC-3-liver metastatic sublines exhibited aggressive invasion features (Fig. 1d) 
and in vivo tumor formation (data not shown). Kaplan-Meier analysis of the mice implanted with metastatic sub-
lines (lung: n = 
 5, liver: n = 
 4) demonstrated significantly worse survival than those implanted with the control 
cells (n = 
 8, P < 
 0.01; Fig. 1e). Additionally, the UM-UC-3-bone metastatic cells demonstrated less invasiveness 
in the Matrigel invasion assay (Fig. 1d) and lower growth potential in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1b) and in vivo 
(data not shown), although the cells exhibited higher expression levels of EMT markers and metastasis-associated 
genes (Fig. 2e). This discrepancy between the expression profile and biological phenotype of the UM-UC-3-bone 
cells can be from the microenvironment-dependent growth of the cells. UM-UC-3-bone cells can grow inside the 
surrounding physically hard materials, including calcium phosphate in bone; as a result, they may not properly 
move in conventional in vitro assays. Further investigation is required to delineate the precise characteristics of 
metastatic bone cells.
In our metastatic model system, AKR1C1 was identified as one of the commonly up-regulated genes in all 
three metastatic cell lines. In this study, immunohistochemistry demonstrated that AKR1C1 was highly expressed 
in metastatic lesions of human bladder cancer patients (Fig. 6a–c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). Although a higher 
AKR1C3 level was reported in the metastatic bone tumors of the prostate cancer38, the molecular mechanism of 
AKR1C1-dependent bladder cancer metastasis had not been previously described.
We investigated the mechanism for the increased AKR1C1 levels in the bladder cancer cell lines and exam-
ined whether pro-inflammatory mediators and growth factors, which are related to tumor progression, regulate 
AKR1C1 expression in bladder cancer cells26,39. Our microarray and qRT-PCR data suggested that metastatic 
tumor cells possess higher expression levels of endogenous IL-6 and IL-1β 
 and their receptors (Figs 2e and 4a,b). 
IL-1β enhanced the expression of AKR1C1 in the three bladder cancer cell lines, UM-UC-3, TCC-SUP, and 5637 
cells (Fig. 4c and Supplementary Fig. 3). The significance of this IL-1β 
 dependent increase in AKR1C1 was con-
firmed in clinical specimens of human bladder cancer tissues (Supplementary Fig. 8).
The molecular machinery for the AKR1C1-dependent up-regulation of EMT and invasiveness was examined 
with AKR1C1 knockdown bladder cancer cells that exhibited less in vitro invasiveness (Fig. 4f). Steroid hormones 
may affect cancer cell migration; for example, 17β 
-estradiol suppresses IL-6-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation 
of Src, p130Cas, and paxillin in gastric cancer cells40. As a result, inhibition of 17β 
-estradiol by AKR1C1 may 
recover cell motility in cancer cells. In fact, for the AKR1C1 knockdown cells, Src and FAK phosphorylation was 
decreased (Fig. 4g). In addition, AKR1C family proteins are implicated in the metabolism of small GTPases, 
 www.nature.com/scientificreports/

such as Ras, Rho, and Rac, through regulating prenylation41. AKR1C may produce geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate 
as the substrate of geranyl-geranyl transferase, providing higher levels of mature small GTPases, such as Rac41. 
The decreased concentration of Rac1 in AKR1C1 knockdown cells (Fig. 4g) may reflect the involvement of this 
pathway.
Recently, AKR1C2 was reported to regulate cisplatin resistance in bladder cancer42. The established liver and 
bone metastatic cells in this study exhibited higher AKR1C1, AKR1C2 and AKR1C3 expression levels (Figs 3c,d

and 5b), and this overexpression appeared to correlate with cisplatin resistance (Fig. 5c,d). It is speculated that in 
cisplatin-resistant cells, AKR1C may reduce the levels of cytotoxic lipid peroxidative products from an aldehyde, 
such as 4-hydroxy-trans-2-nonenal (HNE) and 4-oxo-2-nonenal (ONE)24. To reverse this resistance, we exam-
ined the effect of a chemical inhibitor of the AKR1C family, flufenamic acid (FFA), and found that FFA could 
reverse the cisplatin resistance of metastatic liver and bone UM-UC-3 cells (Fig. 5e). Furthermore, AKR1C1 
expression was associated with cancer stem cells in lung and thyroid cancer43,44. Therefore, AKR1C1 contributes 
to the development of chemoresistance and induction of stemness-like features in metastatic bladder cancer.
In primary localized bladder cancer, particularly after cisplatin exposure, the surrounding tumor microenvi-
ronment may promote IL-1β 
 production by inflammatory lymphocytes. These inflammatory microenvironments 
with IL-1β 
 production may up-regulate the AKR1C1 levels in a specific cell clone, resulting in cisplatin-resistance 
and increased invasiveness, which allows the cells to penetrate into blood vessels and circulate throughout the 
entire body. Finally, these cells can attach to organ tissues, such as the lungs, liver, and bone, to form metastatic 
nodules. A limitation of this study is the use of a single cell line, UM-UC-3, due to lack of tumor forming poten-
tials of other cells, including T24, J82, and TCC-SUP. As FFA suppressed cisplatin resistance and cell invasion 
 
in vitro, FFA may have clinical significance in reversing drug resistance and suppressing metastasis, improving the 
prognosis of bladder cancer patients (Fig. 6d).
Materials and Methods
Cell lines, reagents, and antibodies. 
The human bladder cancer cell line, UM-UC-3, was purchased 
from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Wild-type UM-UC-3 and its sublines were estab-
lished in orthotopic xenograft models (primary bladder cancer, and lung, liver, and bone metastatic cells) cul-
tured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco® 
-life 
Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA). Flufenamic acid and cisplatin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. 
Louis, MO). Human recombinant interleukin (IL)-6 and transforming growth factor-β 
1 (TGF-β 
1) were obtained 
from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), and human recombinant IL-1β 
 was purchased from PeproTech (Rocky 
Hill, NJ). Antibodies were purchased from the following suppliers: the antibody to aldo-keto reductase 1C1 
(AKR1C1) was from Lifespan Biosciences (Seattle, WA); those for Snail, Slug, N-cadherin, phospho-FAK (Y397), 
phospho-Akt (S473), and phospho-Src (Y416) were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); those for 
fibronectin and Rac1 were from BD Transduction; and that for α 
-tubulin was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
Establishment of UM-UC-3 cells stably expressing tdTomato-Luc2. 
UM-UC-3 cells were sta-
bly transfected with pCSII-CMV-tdTomato-Luc2 (kindly provided by Dr. Kyoko Hida, Hokkaido University, 
Sapporo), which was followed by selection using 0.5 mg/mL bleomycin. The resulting live cells were sorted by 
fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS; Aria II, BD, Japan), and the cells with excessive tdTomato expression 
were isolated. Luciferase activity was examined with a luciferase assay (Promega, Madison, WI).
Orthotopic xenograft model. 
We have previously reported on the methods for generating this murine 
model28. Six- to eight-week-old female nude mice, Balb/cA Jcl nu/nu (Clea Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan), were used 
for an orthotopic xenograft model. After the mice were anesthetized with either 1.75% isoflurane or intraperi-
toneal sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg), the bladder was pretreated with 100 μ 
L of 0.1 mg/mL poly-L-lysine 
(Sigma) for 20 min through the urethra with vascular catheters (24G; Terumo, Tokyo, Japan). After that, the 
bladder was flushed with 100 μ 
L of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and 5 × 
 106 UM-UC-3-tdTomato-luc2 cells 
in 50 μ 
L of PBS were inoculated into the bladder. For the 3 h before catheter removal, mice were placed under 
anesthesia. Bioluminescent imaging (BLI) was performed with the IVIS Spectrum imaging system (Caliper 
Life-Sciences, Hopkinton, MA) using a post-intraperitoneal injection of VivoGlo Luciferin In Vivo Grade 
(Promega). Xenograft-derived cells were collected from the primary site, and three metastatic lesions from the 
lungs, liver, and bone were used to establish the following sublines: UM-UC-3-bladder-1 and UM-UC-3-lung 
from mouse 1 and UM-UC-3-bladder-2, UM-UC-3-liver, and UM-UC-3-bone from mouse 2. All animal exper-
iments were conducted in accordance with the guidelines of Hokkaido University Manual for Implementing 
Animal Experimentation and approved by Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Hokkaido University 
Graduate School of Medicine (Number 12-0092). All researchers who performed procedures using live animal 
were pre-approved by the Animal Welfare Committee of Hokkaido University based on their completion of 
required animal use and care training and acceptable previous experience with animal experiments. All ethical 
issues related to animal experiments and human pathological specimens were discussed and approved by the 
Ethics Committee of Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine.
Establishment of primary and metastatic tumor cells in an orthotopic xenograft model. 
At 
45 days post-inoculation with UM-UC-3 cells, the primary and metastatic tumors were identified with the IVIS 
imaging system. The mice were euthanized, and tumor tissues were excised and incubated in medium with col-
lagenase for 30 min at 37 °C. After filtration, the cells were cultured with bleomycin to select tumor cells for two 
weeks, and the primary and metastatic tumor cells were established (Mouse #1; bladder-1 and lung metastatic 
tumors; Mouse #2; bladder-2, liver- and bone metastatic tumors). The established tumor cells were verified using 
a fluorescence microscope to detect tdTomato45.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. 
Total RNA isolation and first-strand cDNA syn-
thesis were performed as previously described46. The primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S1. 
Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed using the StepOne real-time PCR

system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Data were normalized to the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (GAPDH) expression level and are expressed as the fold change relative to control.
Microarray analysis. 
Total RNA was extracted from parental UM-UC-3 and its sublines derived from 
orthotopic xenografts (bladder-1, bladder-2, lung, liver, and bone), and microarray analysis was performed using 
SurePrint G3 Human Gene Expression 8 × 
 60K v2 (Agilent Array® 
). Gene expression was analyzed in bladder-1 
versus lung and bladder-2 versus liver and bone cell lines.
Cell viability assay. 
Cells (1 × 105) suspended in complete DMEM were plated in 60-mm dishes. After 24 h, 
cisplatin and FFA were added to the culture medium. Three days after treatment, the cells were trypsinized and 
counted.
Invasion assay. 
The invasion assay was performed as previously described47. Briefly, 1 × 105 cells suspended 
in serum-free medium were seeded onto the upper chamber. Medium containing 10% FBS as a chemoattractant 
was added to the lower chamber. After 22 h, invaded cells were counted at 200x magnification in at least 3 ran-
domly selected fields.
Immunoblotting. 
Cells were washed twice with cold PBS and lysed in a buffer containing 0.5% NP-40, 
10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM Na3VO4, and the 
lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatants were then subjected to 8–12% 
SDS-PAGE. Separated proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes and blocked using 
Tris-buffered saline containing Tween-20 (TBS-T) with 5% skim milk at room temperature for 1 h. Primary anti-
bodies were incubated at 4 °C overnight and then washed with TBS-T, which was followed by incubation with 
secondary antibodies. The membranes were washed 3 times in TBS-T, and the signal was developed using ECL 
(GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK), which was followed by detection using the LAS4000 (GE Health Care).
Knockdown of AKR1C1. 
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting human AKR1C1 (si-AKR1C1 #1: 
AATTGTTCTGGTTGCCTATAG, si-AKR1C1 #2: TTGGCCAGAAAGGAAAGACAA) were purchased from 
Qiagen (Valencia, CA). Cells (5 × 106) were transfected with 50 nM of si-AKR1C1 or si-scramble as control using 
HiPerfect transfection reagent (Qiagen), and they were subjected to real-time RT-PCR and immunoblotting after 
48 and 72 h, respectively.
Immunofluorescence of paxillin. 
Immunofluorescence of paxillin was performed according to the pre-
vious report47. Briefly, cells were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde for 15 min at room temperature, permeabi-
lised with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 4 min at room temperature, and then incubated with 1% bovine serum 
albumin to block nonspecific binding of antibodies. The cells were further incubated with anti-paxillin antibody 
(1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C, after which immune complexes were detected by incubation for 1 h at room 
temperature in the dark with AlexaFluor488-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:250 dilution). Images were 
acquired with an FV-10i confocal microscope (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
Immunohistochemical analysis. 
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues, including human bladder 
cancer specimens (surgically resected in Department of Urology in Hokkaido University Hospital, Sapporo, 
Japan) that were obtained with informed consent, were sectioned and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed using an antibody to AKR1C1 (Lifespan Biosciences). All ethical 
issues related to the animal experiments and human pathological specimens were discussed and approved by 
the Ethics Committee of Hokkaido University Graduate School of Medicine and Hokkaido University Hospital, 
respectively. Experiments were performed in accordance with the relevant Ethical Guidelines.
Statistical analysis. 
Data are presented as the mean and standard deviations (S.D.) for at least 3 independ-
ent experiments. Student’s t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test, or Spearman’s test were used to analyze significant dif-
ferences. JMP® version 10 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) was used for all calculations. P < 
 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant.
