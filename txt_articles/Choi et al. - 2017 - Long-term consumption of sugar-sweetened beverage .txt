Overconsumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) is known to be a key contributor to the obesity 
epidemic; however, its effects on behavioral changes are yet to be fully studied. In the present study, 
we examined the long-term effects of SSB on social aggression in mice. Three-week-old weaned mice 
started to drink either a 30 w/v% sucrose solution (S30), plain water (CT), or an aspartame solution 
with sweetness equivalent to the sucrose solution (A30) and continued to drink until they were 
11-week-old adults. Aggressive behaviors were assessed by the resident-intruder test. We found that 
SSB significantly promoted social aggression, accompanied by heightened serum corticosterone and 
reduced body weight. To understand the underlying mechanism, we performed transcriptome analyses 
of brain. The profiles of mice on S30 were dramatically different from those on CT or A30. Transcriptional 
networks related to immunological function were significantly dysregulated by SSB. FACS analysis 
of mice on S30 revealed increased numbers of inflammatory cells in peripheral blood. Interestingly, 
the artificial sweetener failed to mimic the effects of sugar on social aggression and inflammatory 
responses. These results demonstrate that SSB promotes aggressive behaviors and provide evidence 
that sugar reduction strategies may be useful in efforts to prevent social aggression.
Aggressive behavior has been traditionally defined as an overt behavior with the intention of inflicting damage 
on another individual1. The potential for aggressive behavior exists whenever the interests of two or more indi-
viduals conflict with broad similarities across species from mice to man1. Although aggression has advantages in 
competitive situations for obtaining food or defending territories and mates from competitors in the wild animal 
kingdom2, it is considered as one of the major social problems in human society. The World Health Assembly 
officially declared violence as a major public health issue in 1996, and the World Health Organization (WHO) 
released the first World Report on Violence and Health in ref. 3. In addition, various forms of violence have 
incurred huge costs in treating victims and repairing infrastructure. Therefore, it is important to identify relevant 
factors to promote or suppress aggressive behavior for effective interventions, thereby improving public health.
Intrinsic factors that modulate aggressive behaviors may include neuropeptides and neurotransmitters, which 
are small protein-like molecules, or chemical messengers regulating neuronal signaling. Vasopressin and oxytocin 
are frequently identified as neuropeptides related to aggressive behaviors. Several animal studies have demon-
strated that oxytocin can reduce aggression4,5, albeit with other conflicting results6, while vasopressin is reported

to increase male-male aggression in birds and mammals7,8. In addition, a glucocorticoid hormone, cortisol in 
human and corticosterone in rodents, is widely studied as a stress hormone and a well-established target in the 
search for hormonal modulators of social aggression9,10. In addition to the roles of cortisol in temper and behav-
iors, it orchestrates a range of different metabolic processes. Cortisol is known to promote catabolic changes in 
the body, therefore, reduction in body weight driven by heightened cortisol is often linked to aggressive behaviors 
in human and animal model studies11–14. Lower levels of serotonin, a neurotransmitter related to mood, were 
reported to induce impulsivity and aggression15. Recently, transcript levels of genes such as Mecp2, Adrbk2, and 
Maoa and a few transcriptional signatures including NF-kB and MAPK signaling have been studied in relation to 
aggressive behavior16–18. Furthermore, environmental factors including socioeconomic status and lifestyles have 
also been shown to affect aggressive behaviors11. Among such extrinsic factors, diet, one of the daily necessities of 
life, is believed to determine spirituality, mental well-being, intelligence, and temperament, including antisocial 
or aggressive behavior19. For instances, administration of tyrosine, an amino acid serving as precursor of catecho-
lamines and neurotransmitters, such as adrenaline and dopamine, was reported to lead to a significant increase 
in global mood scores in human20. Tryptophan-rich diet was also reported to increase the level of serotonin and 
thereby elevate the mood in older women21. With regard to cognitive behavior and mood, caffeine enhanced 
executive control and working memory with reduced feelings of fatigue22. Similarly, sugar has recently drawn 
attention due to possible roles in modulating behavior and mood as well as health and disease.
Sugars are found in the diet either as a natural component of food or as an additive to foods and beverages. 
Although added sugar enhances food desirability by sweetening foods and beverages, it provides only empty 
calories with no nutrient value23. Considering potential negative effects of excessive sugar intake, the WHO has 
recently suggested recommendations on the intake of free sugars in adults and children, with a particular focus on 
the prevention and control of unhealthy weight gain and dental caries24. Increase in sugar intake could be attrib-
utable to rising consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)25,26. Numerous recent studies have reported 
that overconsumption of SSBs might be related to metabolic diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and even 
cancers27–32. While overconsumption of SSBs has been extensively studied for associations with physical health 
problems, its effects on behavioral changes have not been fully studied.
The association between aggressive behavior and sugar consumption remains controversial and inconsistent. 
One study reported that a high level of sugar consumption was positively related with destructive-aggressive 
behaviors in hyperactive children33. Others found that reduced sugar intake might be linked to a lower incidence 
of formal disciplinary actions in juvenile prison inmates34–36. Furthermore, in adolescents, a relationship between 
levels of consumption of sugar-containing soft drinks and behavioral problems was found in a cross-sectional 
population-based survey37. In contrast, no such correlation was found in a study, in which oppositional or aggres-
sive behaviors were assessed in the school-aged children provided with a sugar-sweetened diet38. A lack of sys-
tematic animal studies to examine the causal relationship of sugar consumption with behavior problems is partly 
attributable to the as yet incomplete understanding of the effects of sugar intake on aggression.
In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of sugar on social aggression in an animal model. We 
assessed aggressive behaviors in mice that consumed a high sucrose solution from infancy to adulthood, with 
those given an artificial sweetener solution or plain water. The levels of stress and aggression-related hormones 
were determined along with body weight changes. In addition, to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms 
of aggressive behaviors induced by sucrose consumption, we performed transcriptome analyses of brain tissues. 
Findings from the transcriptome analysis prompted us to assess changes in numbers of inflammatory cells in 
peripheral blood using flow cytometry. The results show that continuous over-consumption of sucrose solution 
from infancy to adulthood leads to increased social aggression with pro-inflammatory responses in the brain. In 
addition, our findings provide insights into understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms by which 
sugar plays roles in promoting aggressive behaviors.
Results
Sucrose consumption led to a significant increase in corticosterone levels. 
Since corticosterone 
secretion was previously reported to be related to aggressive behavior10, we first asked if serum corticosterone 
levels could be affected by sucrose consumption over a short-term period. Similar to cortisol in humans, corti-
costerone is a glucocorticoid secreted from the adrenal cortex in rodents. Corticosterone levels in the blood were 
elevated in a dose-dependent manner in mice that consumed sucrose solutions for 2 weeks compared to control 
mice consuming plain water (Fig. 1a). We found significant increases in corticosterone levels only in mice that 
consumed the highest concentration of sucrose. This result prompted us to investigate the long-term effects of 
the high-dose sucrose solution. 3-week old weaned C57BL/6J male mice were provided with sucrose solution 
ad libitum until 11 weeks of age (S30). Consistent with previous results from a short-term experiment, the levels 
of serum corticosterone in S30 mice were significantly higher than for control mice that consumed plain water 
(CT). Interestingly, a significant difference was also found in the comparison of mice on S30 and those mice that 
consumed an artificial sweetener (aspartame) solution with the sweetness equivalent to the S30 sucrose solution 
(A30) (Fig. 1b). Other hormones known to be related to aggressive behavior were investigated as well. The tran-
scriptional levels of vasopressin (ADH) did not differ among the groups (Fig. 1c). However, S30 mice showed a 
significant increase in oxytocin (OXT) compared to CT or A30 mice (Fig. 1d). These findings implied that con-
tinuous consumption of a sugar solution from infancy to adulthood may lead to hormonal changes that might be 
related to the development of aggressive behaviors and that the hormonal changes are not due to sweet taste alone.
Long-term consumption of sucrose solution elicited aggressive behaviors in mice. 
In order to 
examine if long-term consumption of a sucrose solution would alter aggressive behaviors, resident-intruder tests 
were conducted to evaluate male-male territorial aggression. We measured the frequencies and the durations of 
aggressive attacks by resident mice against the unfamiliar intruder mice, consisting of biting, clinch, lateral threat

and keep down. There was a tendency towards increases in the time and the number of events for each behavior 
in the S30 compared with CT or A30 groups (Fig. 2c), albeit with no significance differences being found. It was 
notable that 100% of mice on S30 showed biting and lateral threat, while a smaller percent of mice on CT or A30 
showed those behaviors (78% in CT and 56% in A30 for biting; 44% in CT and 78% in A30 for lateral threat). The 
total duration of all aggressive behaviors (Fig. 2a) and the latency to show the first attack (Fig. 2b) were deter-
mined as well. Mice in the S30 group showed a dramatically significant increase in the duration of aggressive 
behaviors. Taken together, adult aggressive behaviors were promoted by continuous consumption of sucrose 
solution accompanied with changes in aggression-related hormones.
Transcriptome analyses revealed consumption of sucrose solution induced inflammatory 
responses in the brain. 
To develop molecular understandings of transcriptional networks that might con-
tribute to the promoted aggression by sucrose consumption, we performed transcriptome analyses of brain. Four 
different biological replicates were randomly selected in each group and total RNAs from the hypothalamus of 
each mouse were applied to Illumina whole genome mouse arrays. 3,750 differentially expressed genes were 
identified by one-way ANOVA test with a cutoff of p-value < 
 0.05. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed 
that the gene expression profiles of the S30 group were readily distinguished from those of the CT or A30 groups 
(Fig. 3a). In the comparison of S30 vs. CT with the stringent thresholds of 2-fold changes and p < 0.05, we identi-
fied 522 sugar-responsive genes. A Venn diagram confirmed that the effects of sugar on the brain transcriptome 
were substantially different from those of the A30 group (Fig. 3b), since only 84 genes out of 349 significant genes 
in the S30 group overlapped with the set of aspartame-responsive genes. To identify the significant biological 
functions modulated by aspartame or sugar, aspartame-specific genes and sugar-specific genes were categorized 
based upon their functions and subsequently, the significance was tested with Fisher’s exact test (Fig. 3b). While 
the aspartame solution changed the expression of genes in categories related to development and growth, such 
as Cellular Function and Maintenance, Nervous system development and Function, Cellular Development, and 
Cellular Growth and Proliferation, sugar modulated biological categories of Cellular Movement, Hematological 
System Development and Function, Hypersensitivity Response, Immune Cell Trafficking, Hematological Disease, 
and Infectious Disease. As a point of interest, all top 6 significant biological functions affected by the sucrose

solution are related, directly or indirectly, to inflammatory responses. It is notable that gene expression signatures 
of pro-inflammatory responses including cytokines such as TNF-α 
 and CXCL1 were dramatically changed in S30 
mice compared those of CT or A 30 mice (Fig. 3c). The observations that aggressive behaviors were enhanced 
by sucrose but not by aspartame prompted us to further analyze the differentially expressed genes specifically 
in S30 but not in A30. We therefore focused on the two clusters, A and B, from the hierarchical clustering anal-
ysis (Fig. 3d). In cluster A, normalized gene expression values were increased only in S30, whereas in cluster B, 
gene expression values were decreased only in S30. We confirmed that Inflammatory Response was still the top 
significant category in cluster A (p = 
 2.95E-03) and cluster B (p = 
 1.73E-03). In cluster A, inflammatory mole-
cules such as Mgst1, Ces3, Spn, Abcb4, Cxcl1, P2rx7, and Sh2b3 were included. In particular, Cxcl1 plays a role in 
inflammation as a leukocytes chemoattractant. Sh2b3 encodes a member of the SH2B adaptor family of proteins 
that are involved in a range of signaling activities activated by growth factors and cytokine receptors. Likewise, 
transcripts in cluster B associated with Immunological Disorder included Serpinb3a, Tbxa2r, Tlr7, Slit2, Dusp10, 
and Pik3r1. We next carried out further bioinformatic analysis to predict major upstream regulators of the genes 
in clusters A and B, since it would be critical to understand the upstream regulatory molecules and their associ-
ated mechanisms of action to provide biological insights into the observed changes in expression (Fig. 3e). The 
top four predicted upstream regulators ranked by Z-score were IL1B (z-score = 
 2.404), STAT4 (z-score = 
 2.400), 
CHUK (z-score = 2.190), and TLR4 (z-score = 1.946). All these regulators are well known contributing factors to 
the development of inflammatory responses. Together, long-term consumption of sucrose solution induced the 
activation of transcriptional networks related to pro-inflammatory responses in the brain.
Heightened numbers of circulating inflammatory cells were found in sucrose consuming 
mice. 
The observations that consumption of a sucrose solution increased the serum levels of corticoster-
one and it activated pro-inflammatory transcriptional networks in the brain, led us to determine the number 
of inflammatory cells in the peripheral blood (PBL). Flow cytometric analyses were carried out to assess PBL 
CD11b+ myeloid lineage leukocytes in each mouse. The frequencies of CD11b+ cells were significantly higher 
in PBL of S30 mice than those of CT or A30 mice (Fig. 4a). Glucocorticoids normally reduce inflammatory 
responses by recruiting leukocytes to the sites of inflammation through glucocorticoid receptor signaling in those 
cells. However, in a pathological condition or under chronic stress, it fails to recruit those inflammatory cells as a 
result of developing glucocorticoid resistance39. Therefore, we investigated the associations between the percent 
of CD11b+ cells and corticosterone level using a linear regression model. Although the differences were not 
significant, the serum levels of corticosterone tended to be positively correlated with the percentages of CD11b+ 
cells in CT mice (r = 
 0.4617) and in A30 mice (r = 
 0.2977). On the contrary, in S30 mice, there was a pattern of 
negative correlation between the frequencies of CD11b+ cells and the levels of corticocosterone (r = 
 − 
0.2231).

These results imply that inflammatory cells in mice on S30 might respond differently to the hormone as compared 
to those on CT or A30. In summary, sucrose consumption increased the levels of corticosterone, but the hormone 
failed to suppress inflammatory responses.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the effects of sucrose consumption on aggressive behavior 
in a controlled setting using animal models. First, we found a dramatic elevation in serum corticosterone levels 
in mice that consumed high sugar for a short interval of 2 weeks in a dose-dependent manner. This observation 
led us to examine the long-term effects of high sugar consumption that started in infancy and continued to adult-
hood. We found heightened levels of serum corticosterone when treated mice matured to adulthood as compared 
to control mice. Corticosterone, a dominant glucocorticoid in rodents that is comparable to cortisol in humans, is 
widely studied as a stress hormone and a well-established target in the search for hormonal modulators of social 
aggression9,10. In agreement with other studies, we observed that aggressive mice had higher levels of corticos-
terone. Several other hormones have also been reported for their associations with aggressive behavior. Local 
release of vasopressin within the lateral septum of the brains was reported during a resident-intruder test in adult 
male rats7. Vasopressin release correlated positively with inter-male aggression, and treatment with a vasopres-
sin V1a receptor antagonist reduced the aggression of highly aggressive rats8. Oxytocin was reported to inhibit 
aggressive behaviors in a study showing that oxytocin injection into the brain decreased the frequency of biting in 
lactating female rats4. However, conflicting results were also reported in studies showing that oxytocin knockout 
(OT−/−) mice exhibited a significant decrease in the duration of aggressive attacks in a resident-intruder test com-
pared with wild-type (OT+/+) control mice6. The present study revealed that there was no significant difference in 
expression of vasopressin in S30 mice as compared to CT or A30 mice. On the contrary, expression of oxytocin in 
S30 mice was significantly higher than in the other cohorts. In view of the reported conflicting roles of oxytocin 
in regulating aggressive behavior, our results demonstrate that social aggression promoted by SSB consumption

might be mediated by corticosterone. It is also notable that ingestion of the artificial sweetener did not mimic the 
role of the sugar in elevating corticosterone levels or in promoting aggressive behaviors.
The consumption of a high sucrose solution resulted not only in hormonal changes but also in alterations in 
transcriptional networks in the brain. The hypothalamus is one of the regions in the central nervous system in 
which aggressive behaviors are regulated40,41. Although we used the entire hypothalamus for a transcriptome pro-
filing analysis with the aim of elucidating global transcriptional networks of aggressive behavior (Fig. 2) as related 
to physiological functions-energy balance (Supplemental Fig. 1) and endocrine functions (Fig. 1), it is worth 
noting that the hypothalamus is a heterogeneous region consisting of several anatomical and functional subdivi-
sions42. The precise location and particular neurons in the hypothalamus implicated in aggressive behaviors are 
actively being investigated. Recent studies identified ventromedial (VMN)40,43, premammillary nuclei (PMN)40,43 
and anterior hypothalamic nuclei (AHi)44 as associated with aggressive behaviors. Through extensive bioinfor-
matic analyses of the transcriptome in the hypothalamus, we found SSB consumption activated the transcriptional 
network of inflammatory responses with dramatic increases in the levels of TNFα 
 and CXCL1. Furthermore, the 
frequency of CD11b+ cells in PBL was significantly higher in S30 mice than in CT or A30 mice. These circulating 
inflammatory cells tend to be poorly responsive to corticosterone compared to the cells in CT or A30 mice. The 
poor responsiveness of myeloid lineage leukocytes to the hormone has been previously reported in a human study 
wherein chronic stress resulted in failure to down-regulate the inflammatory response39. Furthermore, it has 
been reported that there is an association between aggressive behavior and elevated C-reactive protein levels in 
schizophrenic inpatients45, and elevated plasma inflammatory markers in individuals with intermittent explosive 
disorder46. We also observed serum proinflammatory cytokines such as IL6 and TNFa were slightly but not sig-
nificantly higher in S30 group than those in CT or A30 (Supplemental Fig. 2). In addition, several studies showed 
that pro-inflammatory responses of the CNS following glucocorticoid stimulation regulated the immune system, 
contributing to altered behaviors47,48. That is, physiological stress induced the activation of the neuroimmune 
system with increases in neural pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines which facilitate peripheral immune 
cell trafficking to the brain, ultimately resulting in abnormal behavioral outcomes49. These results support our 
findings that the aggressive behavior shown in S30 mice is related to augmented neural inflammation accompa-
nied by dysregulated immuno-modulating functions of corticosterone.
The behavioral outcomes shown in A30 mice were different from those of S30 mice, despite equivalent sweet-
ness of the aspartame solution to that of the sucrose solution. This indicates that sugar-induced aggressive behav-
ior is not due to the taste of sweetness. There was a report that acute high-dose administration of aspartame 
reduced aggressive attacks in rats50. However, others reported that rats receiving an aspartame solution would 
make longer and more numerous aggressive responses in association with reduced brain tryptophan levels and 
serotonin synthesis51. We observed that artificial sweetener consumption changed neither the levels of aggression 
hormones nor the transcript levels of genes involved in serotonin metabolism. Transcriptional profiles of brains 
from A30 mice turned out to be dissimilar to those in S30 mice. A number of aspartame-specific genes that were 
altered in their expression in response to aspartame but not to sugar are involved in the development and function 
of the nervous system. A study reported that aspartame produced a biphasic modulation of internal calcium that 
was associated with up-regulation of calcium in resting neurons and down-regulation in activated neurons52. 
In another report, aspartame-treated animals showed an increase in the expression of apoptotic genes and con-
sequently, enhanced neuronal cell death53. These results suggest that aspartame plays distinct roles in neuronal 
functions compared to the roles played by sugar in the brain.
Many studies have reported that intake of sucrose solution can induce abnormal metabolic status, includ-
ing high levels of blood triglyceride, glucose and insulin, leading to body weight gain in human29,54 and animal 
models27,55–57. However, in the present study, there were no significant changes in the levels of glucose, insulin, or 
triglycerides in the blood of S30 mice as compared to CT or A30 mice (Supplemental Fig. 1). Unexpectedly, their 
body weights were significantly lower than those of CT or A30 mice, although the evaluations of growth curve 
in S30 mice showed that they followed a normal growth pattern unlike that of mice on an early malnutrition 
diet58. In keeping with our results, other studies59–62 also reported no significant changes in body weight associ-
ated with consumption of sucrose. This discrepancy might be generated, at least in part, by the fact that different 
experimental designs, such as experimental diet, experimental period, and animal strains have been applied. 
The metabolic effects of sucrose consumption examined together with a high fat diet might be different from 
those associated with a normal fat diet57. In addition, the initiating time point in the life cycle and duration of the 
sucrose challenge might be important contributing factors27,56,63. Animal strain differences might also contribute 
to the discrepancy as well. It was notable that analysis of intestinal sucrase showed that the enzyme was less active 
in C57BL/6 mice than in other strains when the diet was high in sucrose61. Furthermore, according to a study that 
reported higher locomotor activity in mice fed a sucrose solution55, energy expenditure due to augmented activity 
could possibly have contributed to reduced body weight gain and other metabolic indices, such as blood glucose 
or triglycerides, in mice with sucrose consumption. It is well known that glucocorticoids, in addition to functions 
in the CNS, have a wide range of regulatory roles not only in immune functions but also in catabolic functions in 
energy metabolism. In this regard, a number of studies report a link between reduced body weight and aggres-
sion. Reduction in body weight has been positively correlated to altered mood12 and hostile aggression11 in both 
adults and female adolescents13. In addition, chronically stressed mice showed high levels of corticosterone and, 
consequently, reduced body weight leading to enhanced behavioral invigoration14.
In conclusion, the present studies showed the promoting effects of long-term sucrose solution consumption on 
aggressive behaviors. The promoting effects were mediated by changes in serum corticosterone and body weight. 
The roles played by sugar in social aggression were not related to the sweet flavor, since they were clearly distinct 
from those played by an artificial sweetener. Further, transcriptome analyses provided molecular understandings of 
the underlying mechanisms by which sugar drinks induced aggressive behaviors, and showed that long-term sugar 
drink consumption dysregulated the transcriptional networks of inflammatory responses in the brain. Accordingly,

heightened numbers of inflammatory cells in the peripheral blood were found in mice fed the sucrose solution. 
These results demonstrate that long-term sugar consumption from infancy to adulthood promotes aggressive behav-
iors and that these effects are modulated by dysregulation of inflammatory responses in the brain. Therefore, in addi-
tion to the known benefits of sugar reduction on lowering the risk for physical diseases and disorders, a reduction in 
sugar intake might assist in resolving social problems related to aggressive behaviors.
Methods
Mice. 
3 week-old male C57BL/6J mice after weaning were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, 
Maine, USA) and were acclimated for 4 days. Experimental mice were assigned to three groups (8–9 mice per 
each group) and kept in individual plastic cages and maintained on a daily 12 h/12 h light cycle with 60% rela-
tive humidity under conditions of the animal facility at the College of Veterinary Medicine of Seoul National 
University (Seoul, South Korea). Single housing was necessary since the aggressive behavior test requires that 
mice be kept isolated from other mice. Each group was provided a normal diet composed of 20 kcal% protein, 
70 kcal% carbohydrate and 10 kcal% fat (3.85 kcal/g, D12450J, Research diets) with drinks composed of 30 w/v% 
sucrose solution (Saccharose, Daejung, South Korea), aspartame solution (Aspartame 100%, The Nutrasweet 
Company, USA) with equivalent sweetness of 30 w/v% sucrose solution (aspartame is about 200 times sweeter 
than sugar according to U.S. Food and Drug Administration) or plain water ad libitum for 8 weeks. On the 56th 
day after overnight fasting, mice were anesthetized and sacrificed through intraperitoneal injection of 20% ure-
thane (U2500, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) after behavior test. The mice were maintained according to the guidelines of 
Seoul National University Animal Experiment Ethics Committee. All animal experiments were performed after 
receiving approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Laboratory Animal 
Resources, Seoul National University (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee permit number: SNU-
140129-6). All experiments were carried out in accordance with the guidelines and regulations.
Resident-Intruder test. 
On the 52th day, the resident-intruder test was performed to measure and evaluate 
inter-male aggression in adult mice. Resident mice (8–9 mice per each group) were housed individually to establish 
their own territory in a home cage. The intruder mice were group-housed males, 4 weeks younger than the resident 
mice. On day 50, each intruder mouse was introduced to a resident mouse in the resident’s home cage temporarily 
divided by an acrylic board with several holes. At first, the resident and intruder could experience only by their scent 
through the holes in acrylic board for 5 minutes in order to inform the resident that there is a stranger in its home 
cage. Thereafter, the acrylic board was removed and they could explore each other for 10 minutes. All processes 
of the resident-intruder test were recorded. Latency to first attack, duration and frequency of following aggressive 
behaviors were measured and averaged by three different researchers; biting, clinch, lateral threat, keep down.
Serum ELISA. 
Blood samples of mice were collected by heart puncture under 20% urethane anesthesia on the 
day of sacrifice between 9 am to 11 am. Serum was taken from blood samples centrifuged at 1,500 × 
 g for 20 min 
and stored at − 
80 °C. Serum corticosterone levels were measured using Corticosterone ELISA kit (Abcam LLC, 
Cambridge, UK) in accordance with manufacturer’s instructions. The serum concentrations of TNFα 
 were meas-
ured using a commercial ELISA kit (Biolegend); a 100 μ 
l serum sample and assay diluent were placed in each well 
of a 96-well plate coated with a monoclonal mouse IgG against TNFα 
. The mixtures were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C, 
followed by aspiration and three washes with washing buffer. Subsequently, 200 μ 
l conjugate solution was placed 
into each well and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. After washing each well four times with washing buffer, 
200 μ 
l of substrate solution prepared with equal amounts of stabilized hydrogen peroxide and tetramethylbenzidine 
was added for a 20 min reaction in the dark. The reaction was quenched by adding 50 μ 
l stop solution (2NH2SO4)64.
Real-Time PCR (qPCR). 
Mouse brains were obtained and each hypothalamus was separated and snap 
frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted and purified from deep-frozen hypothalami of brain samples 
using RNAqueous-4PCR kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Synthesis of cDNA was done by MessegeSensor™ 
RT kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). Detection of transcripts of vasopressin (NCBI Reference Sequence: 
NM_009732.1) and oxytocin (NCBI Reference Sequence: NM_011025.4) was performed using Applied 
Biosystems® 
 SYBR® 
 Green PCR Master Mix and specific primer pairs amplifying vasopressin (forward 
primer: 5′-CCAGGATGCTCAACACTACG-3′ 
, reverse primer: 5′-CTCTTGGGCAGTTCTGGAAG-3′ 
) 
 
and oxytocin (forward primer: 5′-CCTACAGCGGATCTCAGACTGA-3′, reverse primer: 5′ 
-TCA 
GAGCCAGTAAGCCAAGCA-3′ 
) respectively. Each gene expression level was normalized to GAPDH (forward 
primer: 5′-TGCACCACCAACTGCTTAG-3′, reverse primer: 5′-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTC-3′ 
).
Microarray hybridization. 
For microarray hybridization, total RNA was isolated by homogenizing tissue 
samples of hypothalami using TissueLyser II (QIAGEN, Crawley, UK) and purified using a DNA-free RNA iso-
lation kit (RNAqueous-4PCR kit; Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 
integrity and quantity of total RNA were assessed with a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Wilmington, DE, USA) before the microarray experiments. Its quality was assessed by agarose gel elec-
trophoresis using 1% gels. RNA samples were first amplified for array analysis using the Illumina TotalPrep RNA 
Amplification Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 500 ng 
of total RNA was used to prepare labelled cRNA with overnight incubation according to the manufacturer’s pro-
tocol. The quality and quantity of the labelled cRNA were monitored using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, DE). Amplified cRNA (1.5 ng) was hybridized on MouseWG-6 v2 
Expression BeadChip arrays, containing more than 45,200 well-annotated Ref transcripts in mice, according to 
the manufacturer’s standard protocol. The array were then scanned on a BeadArray Reader (BeadStation 500 G 
Instrument, Illumina Inc.), and Spot images were identified and quantified by the Genome Studio software v1.0.2.

Identification of significant genes. 
The raw data from microarray were pre-processed through 
three steps: background correction was performed, the data were then log-transformed to log2 scale, 
and normalized by the quantile normalization method implemented in the Genome Studio software 
(Illumina Inc.). Significant differences among three groups were identified using ANOVA test (p < 
 0.05) 
on log2-transformed normalized intensities by Partek® Genomics Suite software v6.3 (Partek, St Louis, MI) 
(http://www.partek.com/partekgs). Transcripts with more than a 2-fold differential were selected for each 
specific comparison analyzed.
Bioinformatic analysis of gene expression data. 
Principal component analysis (PCA) was carried out 
by Partek® Genomics Suite software v6.3 (Partek, St Louis, MI) (http://www.partek.com/partekgs). Hierarchical 
clustering analysis was performed with Genesis software v1.7.565 using the Pearson correlation distance matrix 
with average linkage algorithm. Functional identification was categorized by the use of QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® 
Pathway Analysis (IPA® 
, QIAGEN Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity). Upstream regulator analysis was 
performed to predict upstream regulators with a calculated z-score with indirect or direct relationships in the 
dataset through IPA.
Flow cytometry (FACS) analyses. 
Fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) were prepared on day 56, 
by incubating blood with ACK (ammonium-chloride-potassium) buffer to lyse red blood cells at room temper-
ature for 3–5 minutes, and stained using FACS buffer (1X phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] with 0.1% bovine calf 
serum and 0.05% sodium azide) containing phycoerythrin (PE)-conjugated mAb to CD11b (M1/70, eBioscience) 
at 4 °C for 30 minutes. After washing with FACS buffer, the cells were analyzed by a FACSCalibur (BD Bioscience, 
Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Flowjo software (Tree star, Ashland, OR, USA)66.
Statistical Analysis. 
All data were expressed as the mean ± 
 S.E.M. Statistical significance (p-value < 
 0.05) 
was evaluated by Mann-Whitney U test. Statistical analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism 5 software 
(GraphPad Software Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) and SAS Enterprise Guide 6.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). 
For gene analyses, significances for functional enrichment of specific genes were determined by a right-tailed 
Fisher’s exact test as the negative log of the probability that the number of focus genes is not due to random 
chance.
