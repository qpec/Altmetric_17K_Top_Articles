BACKGROUND: Little is known about opioid prescribing among individuals who have survived cancer. Our aim is to examine a pre-
dominantly socio-economically disadvantaged population for differences in opioid prescribing rates among cancer survivors com-
pared with matched controls without a prior diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective population-wide matched
cohort study. Starting in 2010, individuals residing in Ontario, Canada, who were 18 to 64 years of age and at least 5 years past their
cancer diagnosis were matched to controls without a prior cancer diagnosis based on sex and calendar year of birth. Follow-up was
terminated at any indication of cancer recurrence, second malignancy, or new cancer diagnosis. To examine the association between
survivorship and the rate of opioid prescriptions, an Andersen-Gill recurrent event regression model was implemented, adjusting for
numerous individual-level characteristics and also accounting for the matched design. RESULTS: The rate of opioid prescribing was
1.22 times higher among survivors than among their corresponding matched controls (adjusted relative rate, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.34).
Individuals from lower income quintiles who were younger, were from rural neighborhoods, and had more comorbidities had signifi-
cantly higher prescribing rates. Sex was not associated with prescribing rates. This increased rate of opioid prescribing was also seen
among survivors who were 10 or more years past their cancer diagnosis (compared with their controls). CONCLUSION: This study
demonstrates substantially higher opioid prescribing rates among cancer survivors, even long after attaining survivorship. This raises
concerns about the diagnosis and management of chronic pain problems among survivors stemming from their cancer diagnosis or
treatment. Cancer 2017;123:4286-93. V

INTRODUCTION
Relieving moderate to severe pain using opioids is a common part of pain management among patients with cancer.1 For
individuals who survive their cancer, commonly defined as individuals who are at least 5 years postdiagnosis,2-4 pain often
shifts from being a short-term issue during the acute diagnosis and active treatment phase to a chronic problem that can
linger for months or years.5 Factors that could be associated with pain during survivorship could be type and invasiveness
of tumors, modalities of anticancer treatment, comorbid conditions, initial pain management, and other individual char-
acteristics such as race, sex, socioeconomic status, and unemployment.6-9 Recurrence of cancer or second malignancies
may also be reasons for experiencing pain during survivorship.
There are currently no comprehensive estimates on the prevalence of persistent pain in adult cancer survivors. A
range of 21% to 41% was estimated as the pain prevalence 1 to 2 years posttreatment,10 and recent work reported pain
prevalence for long-term survivors to be somewhere in the range of 5% to 56%.11 Studies providing estimates of pain
prevalence among survivors should be interpreted with caution; the time at which a pain survey is taken is a critical compo-
nent, because many treatment-related pains lessen over time as injured tissues heal.7 Recent research has also compared
pain prevalence among survivors of childhood cancer against their siblings.12 The cumulative incidence of pain sensation
and migraine headaches were significantly higher among survivors, although a standardized measure was not used to assess
pain. Compared with siblings, survivors of childhood cancer also experienced a higher prevalence of psychoactive medica-
tion use, based on self-reported medication use.13
Patients surviving cancer typically experience a shift in the use of opioids from the routine prescribing that occurred
in the active treatment phase to a more measured and thoughtful approach that occurs when pain is expected to persist for

 years.7 Specifically, chronic pain management for cancer
survivors ideally involves a multidisciplinary approach
that uses several modalities focused not only on comfort,
but also on improved function.14-17 A combination of
pharmacotherapy with opioids, physical therapy, regular
exercise, and psychosocial interventions may be recom-
mended.7,13 This more holistic approach is similar to
what is recommended for chronic pain management in
the general population who have no prior cancer diagno-
sis, which involves combining opioids with lifestyle activi-
ties that enable the individual to be engaged in valuable
experiences that make life enjoyable.17
To our knowledge, there has been no prior research
conducted at the individual level that examines differences
in opioid prescribing rates among cancer survivors com-
pared with matched controls who have no prior diagnosis
of cancer. The primary aim of this study was to examine
the association between cancer survivorship and opioid
prescribing rates over time in a predominantly socio-
economically disadvantaged population while adjusting
for baseline individual-level characteristics. We also exam-
ined whether the association was different for survivors
who were at least 10 years beyond their cancer diagnosis,
compared with survivors who were 5 to 10 years beyond
their cancer diagnosis. A recent Canadian study using
cross-sectional survey methods reported the prevalence of
pain among adults to be 18.9%18 and, as noted earlier,
the prevalence of pain among cancer survivors is unclear
and has a large range. Moreover, because we are not aware
of how these prevalence estimates will compare in pre-
dominantly socio-economically disadvantaged popula-
tions, and as the guidelines for managing pain among
survivors are similar to the pain management guidelines
for individuals with no prior cancer diagnosis, we hypoth-
esized that there would be no difference in opioid pre-
scribing rates between survivors of cancer compared with
age/sex-matched individuals without a history of cancer.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study Population and Observation Period
This was a retrospective matched cohort study conducted
in Ontario, Canada, in which survivors of cancer (the
exposed group) were matched with individuals without a
prior cancer diagnosis (the control group), after which
each person was followed to determine their opioid pre-
scription rate. To be eligible for cohort inclusion, each
individual had to be part of the Ontario Health Insurance
Plan and the Ontario Drug Benefits Program (ODB).
The Ontario Health Insurance Plan is Ontario’s universal
health care insurance program, which is essentially avail-
able to all Ontario residents. The ODB is Ontario’s
funded Pharmacare program that is available to residents
who are under 65 years of age, provided they are receiving
social assistance (disability or welfare) or their prescription
costs are high relative to their household income.19-21
This population of predominantly socio-economically
disadvantaged individuals are an important group to
examine. Recent work has stated this population to be at
particularly high risk for misuse of opioids and associated
harm; however, their analyses did not include any individ-
uals with a prior diagnosis of cancer.21
At the start of the study period, January 1, 2010, all
individuals who were alive, were 18 to 64 years of age, and
had a prior diagnosis of cancer were identified from the
Ontario Cancer Registry (OCR), which records all inci-
dent cases of cancer diagnosed in Ontario.22 Among
them, only individuals who were at least 5 years past their
cancer diagnosis date and who had no indication of a can-
cer recurrence or second malignancy before the study were
included in the cohort; these individuals were considered
cancer survivors.2-4 An individual was considered to have
experienced a cancer recurrence or second malignancy
before the study if there was evidence of having radiation
therapy, chemotherapy, metastatic disease, or initiation of
palliative care at least 1 year after their cancer diagnosis.
The 5-year survivor mark was used due to our interest in
opioid prescriptions and chronic pain; moreover, individ-
uals in Ontario who show no evidence of disease at 5 years
from diagnosis are typically discharged from the cancer
center and return back to their general practitioner to
receive primary care. Each cancer survivor was then 1:1
matched with an individual who had no prior diagnosis of
cancer as of the index date (January 1, 2010). Matching
was performed based on calendar year of birth (ie, survi-
vors and controls were the same age on the index date)
and sex, which were each retrieved from the Registered
Persons Database.23 Individuals were observed from the
beginning of the study until the end of the study on
December 31, 2012; cancer recurrence; second malig-
nancy; new cancer diagnosis; initiation of palliative care;
death; or loss to follow-up, at which point they were cen-
sored. Cancer recurrence was determined based on initia-
tion of radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or metastatic
disease found in the OCR. This study was approved by
the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre Research Ethics
Board. Datasets were linked using unique encoded identi-
fiers and analyzed at the Institute for Clinical Evaluative
Sciences.

 Outcome Definition
The primary outcome for each individual was the rate of
opioid prescriptions filled at a pharmacy during the obser-
vation period. Because individuals may have obtained
multiple opioid prescriptions and because the time
between prescriptions may vary, the ODB program data-
base was used to retrieve the dates of each opioid prescrip-
tion. Original prescriptions that were dispensed and any
subsequent refills arising from the prescription were all
captured; a subsequent refill was additionally counted and
was not combined together with the original prescription.
Dose changes received through a prescription, whether
increased or decreased, were also captured and counted as
an additional prescription. All prescriptions were counted
in the same way for survivors and controls. Time to opioid
prescription was measured in months, starting from the
index date of January 1, 2010. It should be noted that
only opioids obtained with a prescription were included
in this study. Our data reflect prescriptions that were dis-
pensed and filled at a pharmacy; prescriptions received
but not filled were not captured in administrative data-
bases, nor was it possible for us to know whether the dis-
pensed opioids were actually taken.
Main Exposure and Other Covariate Definitions
The main exposure was cancer survivorship, which was a
binary variable indicating whether each individual was a
cancer survivor or a control. Other covariates included
baseline information on age at the index date, sex, socio-
economic status, rurality, community size, and comorbid-
ity. Type of cancer diagnosis and years since cancer
diagnosis (as of the index date) were obtained from the
OCR and were only available and recorded among survi-
vors. Socio-economic status (SES) was captured through
neighborhood median income quintile (by postal code)
where the first quintile represented the lowest income
group. Rurality, which was also captured by postal code,
was recorded as a binary variable representing whether a
subject lived in a rural area (versus an urban area) in
Ontario. Comorbidity was calculated using the Deyo-
modification of the Charlson score based on diagnoses
coded in the Canadian Institute for Health Information’s
Discharge Database.24,25 A value of 0 is the lowest possi-
ble Charlson score—the lower the Charlson score, the
healthier the patient.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses were conducted by comparing the
distribution of each baseline characteristic among cancer
survivors and matched controls. Categorical variables
were summarized as frequencies and percentages, and
continuous variables were described using the median and
interquartile range. Pearson chi-squared tests were used to
assess the relationships between cancer survivorship and
categorical covariates, whereas associations between can-
cer survivorship and continuous covariates were assessed
using pooled two sample t tests.
Initial crude analyses were conducted by comparing
the opioid prescription rates among cancer survivors with
those of the matched controls. For each group, the crude
opioid prescription rate was calculated by dividing the
total number of opioid prescriptions (numerator of crude
rate) by the aggregated follow-up times (denominator of
crude rate), after which a relative opioid prescription rate
along with a corresponding 95% confidence interval were
obtained. We then conducted an individual-level analysis
to model the association between cancer survivorship
(main exposure) and opioid prescription rates (outcome).
Because each subject was able to receive multiple opioid
prescriptions over time, we implemented an Andersen-
Gill recurrent event multivariable regression model.26-28
The outcome in this model was each individual’s prescrip-
tion rate, which is determined by the number of prescrip-
tions occurring during their period of observation. Unlike
the commonly used Poisson regression model that treats
rate as a constant outcome, the Andersen-Gill recurrent
event regression method models rate as a function of time,
which is important because the times between opioid pre-
scriptions for every individual are not equally spaced. This
is why the time to each prescription (from index) for every
individual is required for the modeling approach. A
robust sandwich variance estimation approach was used
to account for the matched design. As decided a priori,
multivariable regression analyses accounted for all base-
line covariates mentioned above. Note that although
matching was based on age and sex, because this was a
form of exposure-control matching versus case-control
matching, we were able to include these covariates in the
model.
Stratified analyses were also conducted among can-
cer survivors (and their corresponding controls) who had
their cancer diagnosis 5 to 10 years before their index date
and among cancer survivors (and their corresponding
controls) who had their cancer diagnosis 10 or more years
before their index date; stratified analyses were addition-
ally done by type of cancer. In each recurrent event regres-
sion model, a robust variance estimation approach was
used to account for multiple opioid prescriptions from
the same individual, and the Breslow method was used to
handle ties in prescription times across subjects.26,29

 Nonparametric analyses examining the difference in
opioid prescription rates between survivors and matched
controls were performed by estimating mean cumulative
functions for both exposure groups over time.30,31 The
mean cumulative function provides the mean cumulative
number of opioid prescriptions over time. This function
was estimated with corresponding 95% confidence bands
for cancer survivors and controls, and both functions were
visually displayed together.
We also descriptively examined the association
between survivorship and types of opioid prescriptions.
The majority of opioid prescriptions captured in this
study can be categorized by the following 5 types: 1) long
acting oxycodone (older and newer formulations); 2)
transdermal fentanyl; 3) other long-acting opioids (eg,
long-acting morphine, long-acting hydromorphone); 4)
immediate-release single agents (eg, morphine, hydro-
morphone); and 5) immediate-release combination agents
(which contain an immediate-release opioid and one of
either acetaminophen or acetylsalicyclic).21 Only oral and
transdermal formulations were included. In a cross-
sectional manner, we calculated the crude (unadjusted)
rate of prescriptions (per 1000 person-years) for each of
these 5 types of opioids during the study period and com-
pared them among survivors against those without a prior
cancer diagnosis. Statistical analyses were performed using
R 3.1.0.32 Variables with P values less than .05 were con-
sidered to be significant.
RESULTS
A total of 17,202 individuals were included in the study.
Among them, 8601 individuals had survived at least 5
years beyond their date of cancer diagnosis and had no
indication of experiencing a cancer recurrence before the
start of the study. The remaining 8601 individuals were
corresponding age/sex-matched controls who had no
prior diagnosis of cancer. A description of the baseline
characteristics among survivors and controls is provided
in Table 1. Among cancer survivors, the median time
since diagnosis was 10 years with an interquartile range of
7 to 16 years. Other than the matched variables (age and
sex), the distributions of the remaining characteristics
(SES, rurality, and level of comorbidity) were statistically
different between survivors and controls. Table 2 provides
the crude rate of opioid prescribing, calculated as the total
number of opioid scripts divided by the total follow-up
time. The crude rate of opioid prescriptions for cancer
survivors was significantly higher than that of the matched
controls (crude relative rate, 1.220; 95% confidence inter-
val, 1.209-1.232).
Results from the Andersen-Gill recurrent event
regression model are provided in Table 3. After multivari-
able adjustment, the rate of opioid prescribing was 1.22

 corresponding matched controls (relative rate, 1.219;
95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.33). Individuals who
were younger, from rural neighborhoods, and with more
comorbidities had significantly higher prescribing rates.
Sex was not associated with rates of opioid prescribing.
There was also a notable trend in the association between
socioeconomic status and opioid prescribing rates, where
the rates were significantly higher among individuals from
lower income quintiles compared with the wealthiest
income quintile. It should be noted that our results
reflect the associations that are present in a population
of
predominantly
socio-economically
disadvantaged
individuals.
The adjusted relative rate of opioid prescriptions
(survivors against corresponding controls) stratified by
type of cancer diagnosis is provided in Table 4. Survivors
who experienced a prior diagnosis of lung, gynecological,
other gastrointestinal, or other genitourinary cancer had
significantly higher rates of opioid prescribing compared
with their matched controls. Survivors who had a prior
diagnosis of any of the remaining cancer types were not
statistically different in their opioid prescription rates
compared with their matched controls. Table 5 presents
the relative rate of opioid prescribing (survivors against
corresponding controls), stratified by survivors who were
5 to 10 years past their cancer diagnosis and by survivors
who were 10 or more years past their cancer diagnosis. In
both groups, the rate of opioid prescribing was signifi-
cantly higher among survivors compared with their
matched controls.

 cancer survivors and matched controls. The message from
the estimated mean cumulative function is consistent with
the message obtained from the multivariable regression
models. The figure illustrates that, at any given time since
index, the mean cumulative number of opioid prescrip-
tions was significantly higher for survivors compared with
controls, and this trend remained consistent over time. By
the end of the 36-month period, the mean cumulative
number of opioid prescriptions filled by survivors is 7.7,
whereas the mean cumulative number of opioid prescrip-
tions filled by controls is 6.3 (comparison P < .0001).
Based on the cross-sectional descriptive work examining
the association between survivorship and types of opioid
prescriptions, there was no significant association between
survivorship and the prescription rate of immediate-
release combination agents. However, for each of the
remaining 4 types of opioid therapies, the crude rate of
prescriptions was significantly higher among survivors of
cancer compared with individuals without a prior cancer
diagnosis (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates that the rate of opioid prescrib-
ing was significantly higher among survivors of cancer
compared with age/sex-matched controls without a prior
cancer diagnosis. It should be noted that all survivors were
free of cancer recurrence or second malignancy (and all
corresponding controls were free of cancer) during their
period of follow-up. A higher prescribing rate persisted,
even for survivors who were 10 or more years past their
cancer diagnosis. Upon stratifying by type of cancer diag-
nosis, survivors with a prior diagnosis of breast cancer had
a similar opioid prescribing rate as their matched controls;
however, the rate of prescriptions was greater for survivors
of lung, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, or gynecological
cancer compared with their corresponding controls.
Our findings suggest one or a combination of several
possibilities. The prevalence of chronic pain among survivors
may be higher, and may remain higher over time compared
with the prevalence of chronic pain in the general population
with no history of cancer. Prior research has shown indica-
tion of this among survivors of childhood cancer, who were
found to have a significantly higher prevalence of pain com-
pared with their siblings without a previous cancer diagno-
sis.12 Survivors may experience long-term sequelae related to
their diagnosis or treatment that cause persistent pain.33 As
survivors become older, other reasons for chronic pain such
as osteoarthritis become more likely. It is also possible that a
higher rate of opioid prescribing among survivors is due to a
dependency that originated from opioid use earlier in the
disease trajectory.34
It is common for cancer patients who have survived
more than 5 years without a recurrence to be discharged
from the oncology clinic. This raises further concerns
about the diagnosis and management of chronic pain
problems among survivors stemming from their cancer
diagnosis or treatment. Primary care providers who treat
cancer survivors should be encouraged to critically exam-
ine reasons for lingering opioid use among their patients.
Not only can chronic opioid therapy negatively affect the

 immune system, it can give rise to various health problems
such as endocrinopathies, osteoporosis, neurological or
cardiopulmonary effects, and also result in a higher likeli-
hood of abuse and addiction. Specialized teams offering
an integrative perspective may be important for the man-
agement of chronic pain among cancer survivors.11
This study had numerous strengths. It was a
population-wide cohort study analyzed longitudinally at
the individual level. It consisted of a matched 1:1
exposure-control study design, a desirable feature that
allowed for characteristics among survivors and controls
to be similar from baseline. Individual follow-up was ter-
minated at any indication of cancer recurrence, thus
ensuring that opioid rates were captured only during
cancer-free periods of observation. The analytic method
was rigorous and well-suited for the longitudinal structure
of the data; it was able to handle opioid prescriptions as a
repeated outcome. However, the results of the study must
be interpreted in light of several limitations. The adminis-
trative drug data were only available from individuals who
were eligible for the Ontario Drug Benefit program; these
eligible individuals represented only a portion of the prov-
ince’s population under 65 years of age, and that the
majority of these persons were economically disadvan-
taged. All inferences being made from the results of our
work are specific to this population, and generalizability
may be limited to the remaining population. Due to the
requirements for ODB enrollment, which include indi-
viduals with high prescription costs (relative to their
household income), there are notable proportions of sur-
vivors and controls in our cohort with high SES (for
example, 31.6% of survivors and 29.1% of controls reside
in the 2 highest income quintiles). As a result, the magni-
tude in the association between SES and opioid prescrip-
tion rates, and the trend in association as SES varies, are
still important points to bring forward. Although we
adjusted for several well-known confounding variables,
there may be other confounders that could not be mea-
sured, including individual preferences and barriers to
opioid use. Moreover, only opioids obtained with a pre-
scription are included in this study. Our data reflect pre-
scriptions dispensed/filled at a pharmacy; prescriptions
received but not filled were not captured in administrative
databases, nor was it possible for us to know if the dis-
pensed opioids were actually taken.
In conclusion, this large Ontario-wide cohort study
shows that survivors of cancer have higher opioid prescrip-
tion rates compared with matched controls without a
prior cancer diagnosis, and this trend persists even for sur-
vivors who are 10 or more years past their cancer
diagnosis. Further work is required to understand why
this is the case. Physicians providing primary care to can-
cer survivors should consider close examination of reasons
for continued opioid use in order to differentiate chronic
pain from dependency, as well as explore alternative meth-
ods for pain control, such as physical therapy, exercise,
and acupuncture.7,13 Our study emphasizes the need for
survivors of cancer to be cared for by providers that are
able to give supportive cancer care and are experienced in
holistic approaches for managing chronic pain.
