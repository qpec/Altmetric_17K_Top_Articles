Abstract
Background: In 2014, Western Africa experienced an unanticipated explosion of Ebola virus infections. What
distinguishes fatal from non-fatal outcomes remains largely unknown, yet is key to optimising personalised
treatment strategies. We used transcriptome data for peripheral blood taken from infected and convalescent
recovering patients to identify early stage host factors that are associated with acute illness and those that
differentiate patient survival from fatality.
Results: The data demonstrate that individuals who succumbed to the disease show stronger upregulation of
interferon signalling and acute phase responses compared to survivors during the acute phase of infection.
Particularly notable is the strong upregulation of albumin and fibrinogen genes, which suggest significant liver
pathology. Cell subtype prediction using messenger RNA expression patterns indicated that NK-cell populations
increase in patients who survive infection. By selecting genes whose expression properties discriminated between fatal
cases and survivors, we identify a small panel of responding genes that act as strong predictors of patient outcome,
independent of viral load.
Conclusions: Transcriptomic analysis of the host response to pathogen infection using blood samples taken
during an outbreak situation can provide multiple levels of information on both disease state and mechanisms of
pathogenesis. Host biomarkers were identified that provide high predictive value under conditions where other
predictors, such as viral load, are poor prognostic indicators. The data suggested that rapid analysis of the host
response to infection in an outbreak situation can provide valuable information to guide an understanding of
disease outcome and mechanisms of disease.

 Background
Ebola virus (EBOV) causes a devastating
infection
known as Ebola virus disease (EVD) that in many pa-
tients leads to a fatal outcome. The virus responsible for
the 2013-2016 West African outbreak was caused by a
new strain of EBOV called Makona. In the Republic of
Guinea, which was at the epicentre of the 2013-2016
EBOV outbreak, the fatality rate was around 60% and
higher than in Sierra Leone and Liberia. The processes
that lead either to survival or a fatal infection are un-
known although viral load (the amount of virus) can be
a key determinant [1, 2]. This is especially relevant at ex-
tremes where patients with very high viral loads have a
poor prognosis. Factors influencing outcome in patients
with EVD include hospitalisation (i.e. access to palliative
care) [3], anti-viral treatment [4] and age [5].
The interplay between EVD and outcome is complex
and involves a balance between the host response and
viral load. Analysis of four patients from the 2013-2016
EBOV outbreak who underwent intensive treatment and
care at Emory University Hospital in the USA indicated
these patients had a robust immune response during the
acute phase of EBOV infection [6], which challenged
previous assumptions about the ability of EBOV to sup-
press the immune system [6]. Certainly in non-human
primate models of fatal EBOV infection, an extreme
aberrant immunological status and anti-inflammatory
response was shown to contribute to the development of
fatal haemorrhagic fever [7] and this has also been
observed together with lymphocyte apoptosis in fatal
human infections with EBOV [8]. Analysis of samples
from patients with EVD treated in Guinea from the
2013-2016 outbreak also revealed an immune compo-
nent influenced survival [6, 9].
The study of patient samples taken from previous out-
breaks suggests that host responses may delineate sur-
vival
and fatal outcomes
and potential biomarkers
indicative of these outcomes can be identified. In the
2000–2001 Sudan-associated EVD outbreak in Uganda,
the case fatality rate for paediatric patients was lower
than for adults [10]. Data indicated that paediatric pa-
tients who survived had differential abundance of certain
serum proteins from paediatric patients who died and
that, in contrast, adults had similar levels of these same
molecules [11]. Whereas fatality rates in the 2013-2016
West African outbreak suggested that children aged less
than five years had a poorer prognosis [5].
Apart from providing data on the underlying causes of
EVD, being able to predict the outcome of infection
based on analyte concentrations would provide guidance
as to potential treatment and would also uncover new
therapeutic strategies [11, 12]. Several such immuno-
logical/biochemical biomarkers have been identified in a
previous outbreak of EBOV-Sudan [11, 12]. However,
currently, viral load measurements by real-time quanti-
tative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) (given as a
Ct value) are considered the gold standard for predicting
EVD outcome. Viral load measured as Ct can give some
indication for outcome [1, 13], and has been particularly
useful in the triage of patients for experimental anti-viral
trials for EBOV [14]. Viral load for predicting outcome
works well, particularly at extremes of Ct, where for ex-
ample a Ct of 12 would be suggestive of a fatal infection
and a Ct value of 30 would be indicative of survival.
However, it works less well where Ct values are not able
to distinguish outcome, mainly between Ct 20 and Ct
22. Here the outcome is approximately equal between
survival and a fatal infection.
The 2013-2016 EVD outbreak was unprecedented in
scale and has revealed previously unappreciated aspects
of EBOV biology, such as persistence in semen [15]. The
strain responsible for this outbreak, EBOV Makona, also
appears to have different growth kinetics when com-
pared to previous strains, having a delayed onset to dis-
ease progression in a non-human primate model of EVD
[16] and reduced lethality in an immune-deficient mouse
model [17]. Given the potential new strain variation of
EBOV responsible for this outbreak and EVD is a disease
of the host response, we wanted to investigate this using
a genomics approach to identify transcriptome changes
in peripheral blood from acute patients who either went
on to survive or die from EVD. This would allow us to
investigate whether those patients that succumbed to
EBOV showed a hyperactive response to infection and
also potentially to identify host-based response markers
that can help predict survival in situations where viral
load gives little predictive value.
Therefore, to characterise the infection of EBOV
Makona in the human population, we first used deep
sequencing to define the transcriptomic profile of blood
taken from acute patients who either went on to sur-
vive or die from EVD. These samples were obtained
from patients located in Guinea. During the 2013-2016 out-
break, Guinea recorded the highest death rate for EBOV.
Thus, EVD patients in Guinea were optimal for correlating
changes in the host response to outcome—either a fatal or
non-fatal infection. Their responses to EVD would not
have been influenced by intensive palliative and/or ex-
perimental care that was utilised in high-income coun-
tries to treat repatriated healthcare workers, where
81.5% of patients who received supportive care survived
[3]. In contrast, the survival rate in Guinea was ap-
proximately 40% throughout the outbreak. These tran-
scriptional signatures from acutely ill patients were
compared to profiles obtained from former patients
who had recovered from EVD and were EBOV-negative
by qRT-PCR and also to data obtained from healthy
volunteers mined from historical datasets.

 Using transcriptome data from acutely infected pa-
tients and from the control patients, profiles were identi-
fied that highlighted differences in the host response to
EBOV at the time of acute infection. These data were
obtained for patients who were either going to survive
or die from EVD. The profiles of acutely infected indi-
viduals differed from the survivor EBOV-negative group
and the healthy controls. The profiles provide significant
insight into the global circulating immune response to
EBOV in acutely infected patients on a scale that has
previously not been possible. Significantly, differences in
immune cell populations predicted through analysis of
gene expression patterns were validated on an independ-
ent group of EVD patients using flow cytometry to dir-
ectly measure the same cell types in patient blood.
Machine learning was used to identify a panel of genes
whose abundance could be used to predict the outcome
of infection at the acute phase. This panel was validated
on a separate independent group of patients with either
a fatal or non-fatal outcome and whose viral loads were
similar and was found to accurately predict outcome. This
would be particularly useful in a clinical setting in cases
where the viral load provides little to no predictive power.
Results
Analysing patient groups with EVD
To identify changes in the host response following ex-
posure to EBOV, the transcriptome of blood samples
from infected patients was analysed. These samples were
collected by the European Mobile Laboratory in Guinea
during 2014 and 2015. The samples were taken with the
foremost aim of diagnosing the presence of EBOV using
qRT-PCR, which was then used in patient management
in the Ebola Treatment Centre (ETC). For this purpose,
RNA was extracted in the setting of the European
Mobile Laboratory in Guinea. Discarded samples were
then held in an archive and used in this study under the
auspices of the EVIDENT project– Ebola Virus Disease
correlates of protection, determinants of outcome and
clinical management. These discarded samples were then
analysed by RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to identify and
quantify messenger RNA (mRNA) expression. Following
sequencing of 138 individual samples from individual
patients, sample selection criteria were used to identify
and remove datasets from samples that showed evidence
of having degraded mRNAs (expected from field sample
collection) (Table 1). These criteria included the removal
of samples that showed poor mapping and low correl-
ation values (Fig. 1 and ‘Methods’). Here, samples were
selected that had a similar within-sample transcriptional
profile (with an average correlation co-efficient above
0.8), thus reducing extreme variation within one patient
group due to mRNA quality issues. From an initial set of
138 individual sequenced samples from separate pa-
tients, application of these selection criteria led us to
discard 26 and analyse the data from 112 unique pa-
tients: acute-survivor (n = 24) and acute-fatal (n = 88).
The outcome for these patients was unknown at the
time of sample collection and subsequently recorded as
they either succumbed to a fatal infection or survived
EVD. These were from a mixture of Plasmodium (the
causative agent of malaria) negative and positive pa-
tients. Importantly, there was no significant difference in
the time between symptom onset (as reported by the pa-
tient) and taking of the sample during acute illness. The
mean time to the onset of symptoms for the acute survi-
vors was 6.4 days and for acute fatalities was 5.9 days
with a range of 2–19 and 2–22 days, respectively.
To provide a baseline for gene expression, a blood
sample was taken from a separate group of 16 survivors

 that were EBOV-negative by PCR and convalescent for
the disease and recovered from infection (recovered con-
trol group) (Table 1). This control group represented a
critical comparison population. During the 2013-2016
outbreak, amid the breakdown of the in-country health-
care system and the stigma of being seen associated with
ETCs, acquiring samples from non-infected patients was
not possible. The EBOV survivors represented a known
EBOV-negative population that were also tested and
confirmed to be Plasmodium-negative with no other
overt signs of a febrile illness (which could have im-
pacted the results in a control group). We also made use
of historical datasets obtained from the RNA-seq ana-
lysis of peripheral blood taken from healthy volunteers
based in British Columbia (Canada) (n = 6) and thus
would not have been exposed to EBOV or a range of
other pathogens present in West Africa [18] (GEO
Number GSE53655) (Table 1).
Analysis of gene responses of patients that differentiate
fate after EBOV infection
We compared the transcriptomes from these different
groups to identify mRNAs in survivors and in fatal cases
that showed greater than twofold changes (false discov-
ery rate (FDR) 5%) in abundance compared to the recov-
ered control group. In the acute-survivor group, almost
1300 genes were increased in transcript abundance com-
pared to the survivor control group. The corresponding
value for the acute-fatal group was 2200 of which half
were redundant with those in the acute-survivor group
and approximately 1200 were unique to the fatal cases
(Fig. 2a and Additional file 1). Additional file 1 shows
any gene transcript with an absolute log2 fold change
greater than 2 with a FDR of 5%. Most of the gene tran-
scripts were common to both the acute-fatal versus
acute-survivor group. Additionally, some gene tran-
scripts that had abundance differences were restricted
to the acute-survivor group. Thus, in the blood from
individuals with acute EBOV infection, mRNAs of vari-
ous pro-inflammatory factors such as CXCL10, CCL2/
MCP-1, CCL8/MCP2 and CXCL11 showed increased
abundance when acute-fatal cases were compared to
acute-survivors (Additional file 2). Similar changes in
mRNA abundance were observed in a publicly available
dataset from non-human primates (NHPs) that sur-
vived the challenge with EBOV (Additional file 2).
Analysis of gene pathways differentiating fate after
EBOV infection
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) showed that in
acute patients both surviving and having a fatal infection
were associated with a significant enrichment of genes
from within the same signalling pathways (Fig. 2b). The
most significantly represented included gene sets associ-
ated with interferon signalling, complement, coagulation,
hormone receptor and acute phase signalling. Many
interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) were strongly in-
creased in abundance in all acute infection cases com-
pared to the recovered control group. There was greater

samples that fell below this within-group mean correlation were removed from analysis. This led to selection of 88 acute fatal samples and 24
acute survivors

 increased in abundance of these gene transcripts in
acute-fatal compared to acute-survivors.
In addition to GSEA, we also analysed the patterns of
differentially expressed genes using Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis (IPA) (Qiagen Bioinformatics) to identify signal-
ling pathways associated with infection. Pathways show-
ing significant upregulation in acute infection are shown
in Fig. 2c. This analysis identified many of the same
pathways identified in GSEA such as complement, acute
phase signalling and coagulation factors, but also identi-
fied signalling pathways not identified by GSEA, such as
IL-6 and IL-8, indicating strong activation of these cyto-
kines in EVD. IL-6 signalling has previously been shown
to be associated with fatal EBOV infections in some
studies [8, 19] but not others [11]. Our data support the
conclusion that IL-6 signalling was upregulated in both
the acute-survivor and acute-fatal cases. Spider plot
analysis (Fig. 2d) showed that in almost all gene expres-
sion categories, acute patients that succumbed to infec-
tion showed a more robust immune response.
There
were

distinctive
differences
in
gene
expression patterns when the transcriptomes from
acute-fatal cases were compared to those from acute-
survivors. A total of 246 transcripts were identified as
being differentially abundant (log2FC > 1, FDA 5%), of
which 220 transcripts or more increased (higher in fatal
cases) and 26 decreased (Additional file 3). This differ-
ential abundance was most strongly observed in genes
associated with coagulation and acute phase signalling.
Figure 3 shows the five most strongly differentially
expressed genes, of which four were associated with the
clotting cascade genes, including fibrinogen (FG) alpha
chain (FGA, +54-fold), beta chain (FGB, +28-fold) and
gamma chain (FGG, +19-fold). The increased abundance

 of these mRNAs is again consistent with deposited
transcriptomic data from EBOV-infected NHP studies
[20] (Additional file 4).
The transcriptome profile of peripheral blood from the
recovered control group may have been influenced by
any remaining EBOV antigens and/or other infections
(although the patients were Plasmodium-negative at the
time the peripheral blood sample was taken to confirm
convalescence). This may therefore have skewed any
transcriptome comparison to the acute patients. To test
this hypothesis, we made use of a historical dataset de-
posited on GEO (GSE53655) that was an analysis of
peripheral blood from healthy volunteers [18] (n = 6)
(Table 1) and compared this to the transcriptome profile
from the recovered control group. Given the location of
the study for the health volunteers was the University of
British Columbia in Canada [18], we assumed that these
individuals had not been exposed to EBOV, Plasmodium
or other pathogens prevalent in Guinea. Differential
gene expression (DGE) and GSEA indicated no signifi-
cant difference in the transcriptome of peripheral blood
between the healthy volunteers and the recovered con-
trol group (Fig. 4).
Changing immune cell types in the acute phase are
related to patient outcome
Changes in mRNA abundance in the blood sample be-
tween the acute-survivor and acute-fatal patient groups
may have been due to changing gene regulation in the
cell types present or changing proportions of specific
immune cell types. We used digital cell quantification
(DCQ) [21] to identify which cell types may have been
differentially abundant in acute-survivors and acute-fatal
relative to the recovered control group. In both the
acute-survivor and acute-fatal groups, DCQ predicted a
decrease in CD4 T cells [22] and a significant increase in
CD8 memory T cell signature in acute-survivors that is
consistent with flow cytometry analysis from patient
samples [9] (Fig. 5a and Additional file 5). This analysis
also demonstrated a potential decrease in the popula-
tion of circulating monocytes during acute infection
with EBOV (Fig. 5b) with a stronger potential decrease
in the acute-fatal compared to the acute-survivor group
(Additional file 5).
To investigate the DCQ-based predictions, flow cy-
tometry analysis was used to compare blood samples
taken from an independent and geographically separate
group of patients (in Guinea) classified as acute-fatal
(n = 20), acute-survivor (n = 17), EBOV-negative but
with Plasmodium (n = 5) and other febrile illness (but
EBOV-negative) (n = 10) (Table 1). The flow cytometry
analysis indicated that in the patients with EVD, who
went on to have a fatal outcome, they displayed low
frequencies of circulating CD14+ classic monocytes in
peripheral blood (Fig. 5d and Additional file 6) com-
pared not only with surviving patients, but also with
patients with other acute infectious diseases including
malaria (Fig. 4d), consistent with the predictions from
the DCQ analysis. In addition, the frequency of blood
monocytes in patients positively correlated with viral
load, which indicated a statistical association between
the loss of circulating monocytes and high viremia
(Fig. 5e). Natural killer (NK) cells were predicted to ac-
cumulate in acute-survivors when compared to the
acute-fatal group (Fig. 5c). Indeed, we predicted that
NK cell types were more abundant in acute-survivors

 than in the acute-fatal group (Fig. 5c), which was con-
sistent with an increase in mRNA abundance in the
acute-survivor group of the NK markers interferon
gamma (+4 fold over convalescent controls) and per-
forin (+3 fold over convalescent controls).
Predictive models based on differentiated gene responses
between patient groups
Differential gene expression analysis might provide suit-
able biomarkers for predicting the eventual outcome of
infection in individual patients and thereby better direct
their treatment. We assessed if a subset of differential
expression (DE) genes could be correlated with outcome
using
three
independent
machine
learning-based
methods. The first method used support vector machine
(SVM) analysis. Predictive models based on the top ten
genes ranked by p value (79% accuracy) performed bet-
ter than models based on the level of EBOV RNA in a
qRT-PCR [14]. However, genes identified through this
approach were not linked to known components of the
immune response and both models showed wide dis-
persions for each gene, which contributed to overlaps
between
the
acute-survival
and
acute-fatal
groups
(Additional file 7). Including samples from the recov-
ered control group in the analysis improved predictive
performance slightly and included some of the invoked
genes that showed DE responses to EBOV exposure.
To

 to define a better SVM classifier (Figure 6c and
Additional file 8). The resulting group of ten genes im-
proved the accuracy of outcome predictions from 79%
to 85% (97 of 112 case outcomes predicted correctly).
Figure 6a illustrates the resulting separation of acute-
fatal cases from instances of acute-survival, while Fig. 6b
shows a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
compared to Ct. The optimistic bias for the area under
the curve (AUC) prediction for this model for the train-
ing and testing data was 0.11.
Two other methods were also used to identify gene
sets that correlated with outcome. The second method
used random forest (RF) and this improved accuracy to
89% (Additional file 8 and 9), again with ten genes as
classifiers of outcome. The third method was an entirely
different approach and used an intensive optimisation
protocol to establish a panel of gene pairs (Additional
file 8) for which the consensus expression profile across
the panel for acute-survivors were maximally differenti-
ated from the acute-fatal group (‘Methods’
, Additional
files 10 and 11). We termed this the Paired Gene Profil-
ing method. Classification of a query patient was
achieved by correlation of his/her expression profile
across the panel to one or other of the alternative classi-
fier profiles. This technique achieved 92% accuracy,
using a select group of ten genes that were included
within the panel of classifier genes for the improved
SVM model (Additional file 8). Thus, the ability to

 predict outcome was independent of the method used
to achieve it.
To test whether these predictions of patient fate were
not overly optimistic, we adopted a ‘bootstrapping’
technique. The random resampling of subsets of the
overall patient data provides a large number (i.e. 1000)
of independent estimates of the predicted status of each
patient. The consistency of the outcomes can then be
explored from the resulting histogram (Additional file 9),
which if normally distributed, as indicated by the linearity
of the corresponding QQplot (Additional file 9), is de-
scribed by a mean ± 95% confidence interval (CI). We
show for each
of
the
different
predictive
methods
employed that the distributions were well described by a
normal distribution, and that the 95% CIs for predictive
accuracy for the RF test were 0.758–0.876, while those for
the paired gene profiling (PGP) test were 0.793–0.953.
These all lay within ± 8% of the corresponding mean
values. Given the absence of data for independent
validation, this outcome offers good support to a highly
consistent predictive accuracy across the different models.
Effects of viral load on predictive outcome and testing on
a separate group of patients with EVD
The DGE analysis and gene classifiers were generated
from patients that had a diverse range of viral load. We
wanted to examine whether both were independent of
viral load and instead just reflected the host response to
EBOV infection. To investigate this, we determined the
transcriptome of blood samples taken from an inde-
pendent group of patients from that used in the initial
DGE analysis and for gene classifiers. We focused specif-
ically on samples from new patients whose viral loads
were not significantly different (Ct = 20–22) between a
fatal (n = 10) or non-fatal outcome (n = 10) (Additional
file 12). This is a crucial range for viral load as between
these Ct values the outcome of EVD cannot be predicted
as the case fatality rate in this group of patients was

 approximately 50% from the outbreak in Guinea. From
a disease biological perspective, this allowed us to in-
vestigate whether the observed differentially expressed
genes between a fatal and survivor outcome were po-
tentially related to viral load. For example, a lower viral
load promoted survival or whether DGE was poten-
tially host-moderated. All of these selected patients
were antigenically negative for Plasmodium and thus
the outcome and the host response were not compli-
cated by malaria. DGE analysis between these two
groups of patients identified the enrichment of very
similar transcript abundance to that described in the
original DGE analysis on the acute-fatal and acute-
survivor patients groups (Additional file 13), suggesting
that the host response (at least at the transcript level in
the blood) was mainly independent of viral load. There
was also good correlation between the top five differen-
tially abundant gene transcripts expressed in the n = 20
study and the n = 112 patient study (Additional file 14).
When the ten gene SVM classifier was compared to
the Ct value in this group, it greatly outperformed the
Ct value in predicting survival as seen in the ROC and
partial (pROC) in Fig. 7. The ten gene RF classifier was
also able to predict survival in this group of patients
where the Ct value failed. This shows that the ability of
the biomarker to predict outcome was independent of
Ct value and is useful predicting outcome in patients
where the Ct value is uninformative.
Discussion
Understanding the pathogenesis of rare outbreak dis-
eases such as EBOV is both difficult and important. To
date, the overwhelming majority of cases of this disease
have occurred in situations where high-quality health-
care and monitoring are challenging. This has made it
difficult to understand in detail many of the basic as-
pects of disease development and pathogenesis; informa-
tion on the disease has been gathered through animal
models [16, 17].
Here we show that transcriptomic sequencing of blood
samples taken from humans during the 2013-2016 West
African outbreak and leftover from diagnostic sequen-
cing can be an important means of acquiring multiple
levels of information about the host response to virus in-
fection, ranging from understanding how immune cell
populations in the blood change over time during infec-
tion to helping define potential host biomarkers of infec-
tion. This strongly argues that integrating transcriptomic
analysis of host responses during outbreaks can provide
important insights into disease pathogenesis that affect
clinical management. The strong ISG response observed
in the large cohort of EVD patients is notable. IFN-like
responses have been reported to be associated with
moderate disease in a diverse set of US EBOV patients
[23] and have been suggested to be protective for EBOV
infection [24]. The existence of a strong innate immune
response in acute cases in Guinean patients, given their
differing clinical outcome and treatment, suggests that
this response may not be offering significant protection
to promote survival.
A particularly interesting finding from this study was
the effectiveness of using a recovered control group as a
comparison population to investigate differential gene
expression. Ideally, a control group from Guinea that
was never infected with EBOV would have been optimal;
however, at the time (and still persisting), stigma

 associated with EBOV and ETCs rendered such a group
challenging to identify and ethically problematic to take
blood samples. Using recovered control group tran-
scriptomes had the potential to identify some responses
that began during acute Ebola infection and had not
been resolved when samples were taken from the con-
trol group. However, comparison of the peripheral
blood transcriptomes from this group to historical data-
sets from a completely unrelated healthy control group
separated both geographically and temporally from the
West African outbreak [18] indicated no significant dif-
ferences in the transcriptome (Fig. 4). This suggested
that at least when the peripheral blood samples were
taken the control group had recovered from infection.
We find that immune-cell populations predicted by our
comparison analysis (Fig. 5) and biomarkers identified
through comparison were both verified in independent
datasets (e.g. Fig. 6 and Additional file 13). It is unlikely
that the Ebola outbreak will be the only one in which
the ‘ideal’ control population is difficult to sample
and our results suggest that convalescent patients
may serve as an important alternate control. By ne-
cessity, datasets from samples that had poor-quality
reads were excluded from the analysis presented in
this work. This may have biased the identification and
measurement of differentially expressed genes as well
as the downstream analysis of gene classifiers that
correlated outcome. However, the underlying biology
of EVD identified in this study through the transcrip-
tomic approach correlated with both data from non-
human primate studies and clinical information from
patients.
The increased accumulation of mRNAs for genes in-
volved in the clotting cascade found during acute infec-
tion with EBOV is consistent with earlier findings that
fibrin deposition was closely associated with EBOV in-
fection [25, 26]. The increased abundance of multiple
FG gene isoforms as well as the increased abundance of
albumin mRNA is initially perplexing, as these genes are
considered liver-specific mRNAs and not mRNAs that
are found in blood. We favour the hypothesis that the
accumulation of these genes is an indication of signifi-
cant liver damage leading to leakage of hepatic mRNAs
into the blood [27]. It is important to note that during
this outbreak, overt haemorrhaging was rarely observed
[28], but strong increases in the abundance of these
genes was seen in both the acute-survivor and acute-
fatal patient groups, suggesting that significant liver
damage was present. As a measure of aberrant liver
function, in patients with EVD, aspartate transaminase
(AST) values were found to be higher than alanine
transaminase (ALT) [29]. This finding is consistent with
observations of liver damage in repatriated patients from
Liberia treated in the United States [30].
An important finding of this study is the similarity of
the transcriptomic data to protein expression data ana-
lysing cytokine expression observed in this [9] and earl-
ier outbreaks [8]. These data emphasise the similarity
of cytokine abundance information collected through
this approach to that seen in previous EBOV outbreaks
and also to NHP models of EVD in humans (Additional
file 2). The robust IFN response seen in human infec-
tion was somewhat surprising based on earlier reports.
However, this was consistent with data from NHP
models of lethal infection with this virus [31] that also
show very strong increases in IFN-responsive genes in
circulating immune cells and suggests that more robust
IFN signalling may decrease an individual’s ability to
survive EBOV infection. Certainly, our study on pa-
tients treated in a low-income setting and results from
patients treated in a high-income setting [6] challenges
the assumption that humans do not mount a robust
immune response.
The changes in the immune response identified in this
study in the acute phase of EVD between acute-
survivors
and
acute-fatal
patients
were
potentially
caused by the differential activation of gene transcription
and also potential infiltration/exfiltration of different
cell types in the blood. Our prediction that monocyte
cell populations were higher in the acute-survivors than
the acute-fatal patients was validated on an independ-
ent group of patients using a cell-based approach
(Fig. 5d)—completely different to that of RNA-seq
(Fig. 5a and Additional file 6). We also predicted that
NK cell populations were higher in acute-survivors
compared to acute-fatal patients during the acute
phase. NK cells have been previously suggested to be
important innate immune cells in fighting EBOV infec-
tion [32], so the increased abundance of these cells per-
haps providing the crucial survival advantage to the
acute-survivors group.
Independent machine learning approaches identified
different panels of genes whose abundance could accur-
ately predict outcome over a range of Ct values. Using
host gene profiles to predict outcome also worked for
those Ct values (between 20 and 22) where the outcome
was not clear in the data from the European Mobile La-
boratory, i.e. where the case fatality rate was approxi-
mately 50%. Other studies have also shown that Ct
values can be used to predict outcome. For example, a
study of EVD patients in Sierra Leone showed that pa-
tients with a Ct ≥ 24 had an 87% chance of survival,
whereas patients with a Ct value < 24 had a 22% chance
of survival [2]. Interestingly, the average patient Ct value
in samples processed by the European Mobile Labora-
tory was 21.4, implying that for the average patient their
outcome could not have been predicted based on Ct
value alone. We show that the identified gene classifiers
Liu et al. Genome Biology  (2017) 18:4 
Page 11 of 17
 were valid over a wide range of viral loads which clearly
indicated that the host response was unrelated to the
amount of viremia. The classifiers were tested on an in-
dependent group of 20 patients. This provided strong
preliminary information that the model was not highly
over-fitted, though additional samples would increase
confidence.
Assessing viral load together with an evaluation of the
host response at the time of diagnostic sampling may
give an accurate indication of the survival chance for the
patient, across a broad range of viral loads. Management
of patients in the developed world resulted in far better
survival rates than the management of patients in West
Africa, due to extensive palliative intervention; therefore,
the acute and fatal outcomes in this study may be more
reflective of the situation in untreated patients. The tri-
age of large numbers of patients under very resource-
poor situations may promote survival rates by focusing
efforts on those most in need. Predictive models based
on clinical data have also been proposed to determine
the outcome for patients with EVD [33].
The ability to triage patients by disease severity and
likely outcome can be of practical benefit for patient
care. In any outbreak setting, it is inefficient to have the
resources for the most intensive care scattered about the
Ebola Treatment Unit (ETU). Developing tests that allow
the stratification of risk would allow an ETU to central-
ise intensive care resources for maximum efficiency and
efficacy.
Our findings also have implications for the design of
clinical trials. Recent studies used Ct value as a proxy
for the probability of survival (e.g. the Favipiravir trial),
but as we demonstrate here, Ct-based prediction is not
perfect. As our results provide improved prediction of
outcome, the potential to show an effect of a therapeutic
through a clinical trial is improved. During the last out-
break, there was much public disagreement over the eth-
ics of randomising patients with EVD to control groups
in clinical trials [34–36]. In our opinion (and that of
others), a reasonable compromise position would be to
exclude from randomisation those patients with the low-
est probability of survival and provide them with the
study drug. The results of our work would allow for a
more accurate identification of those EVD patients with
a low probability of survival rather than simply rely on
Ct values at admission.
The mRNAs associated with the correct prediction of
outcome include the transcription factor eomesodermin
(eomes), an important characteristic of CD8 T cell mem-
ory transition [37], and is consistent with our prediction
of increased CD8+ memory cells in survivors (Fig. 5).
Consistent across the three gene sets identified by SVM,
RF and the PGP profile-based classifier were TGFB1,
VACM1 and HOPX. TGFBI is an extracellular matrix
protein that inhibits cell adhesion and is seen to be
downregulated in both fatal patients and survivors.
VCAM1 is a gene important for lymphocyte extravasa-
tion to sites of infection. This gene has previously been
shown to be upregulated in response to EBOV infection
[38], consistent with our prediction of increased CD8+
memory cells in survivors (Fig. 5). The decreased abun-
dance of TGFB1 and the increased abundance of
VCAM1 is suggestive of an increase in cell adhesion
with an increased instance of leukocyte cell adhesion to
the endothelial layer and movement out of the blood
into tissues.
Conclusions
These data demonstrate that a blood sample from a pa-
tient with EVD is a powerful source of disease informa-
tion, which is relevant to clinical treatment. Analysing
the population of mRNAs present in the blood provided
information on the extent of the immune response to in-
fection, the immune cells engaged (and depleted) during
infection, and also the accumulation of mRNAs likely
derived from damaged internal organs such as the liver.
The changes in mRNA abundance also proved to be a
reliable means of predicting whether an individual pa-
tient would survive or succumb to EVD.
In large-scale outbreaks, blood represents one of the
most available and informative of diagnostic samples.
Our studies suggest that using collected blood to analyse
how a patient is responding to infection will allow better
diagnosis and prediction of disease outcome for this
highly fatal infection. Though the analysis of a patient’s
response to infection has not always been thought of as
an important component of a diagnostic approach, this
report and others [39–41] show that it has significant
value and likely should be adopted into future diagnostic
and treatment approaches.
It is important to note that the differences between
patient groups are likely to have been due to a mixture
of gene regulation and changes in the cell types repre-
sented in the blood samples. This complexity offers op-
portunities to identify cell populations recruited to
successfully combat infection. Our analysis supports
the hypothesis that in acute patients who survive infec-
tion, gene transcripts associated with the presence of
NK cells may play a major role in outcome, suggesting
that approaches to enhance this population of cells
could be an effective EVD treatment strategy.
Integration of this type of analysis in future outbreak
responses could help direct therapy and maximise a
beneficial outcome of infection, particularly in the devel-
opment of diagnostic approaches that can accurately
stratify patients for treatment based on the likely out-
come of infection.

 Methods
RNA extractions, library preparation and sequencing
Samples from patients were sequenced on a HiSeq2500
and several criteria were applied to the selection of data
post sequencing. A total of 38,554 genes were mapped
to the 64,253 genes in the annotated human genome
database. The RNA was DNase treated using Ambion
Turbo DNase. RNA–seq libraries were prepared from
the DNAse-treated RNA using the Epicentre ScriptSeq
v2 RNA-Seq Library Preparation Kit and following
10–15 cycles of amplification; libraries were purified
using AMPure XP beads. Each library was quantified
using Qubit and the size distribution assessed using
the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyser and the final libraries
were pooled in equimolar ratios. The quantity and
quality of each pool was assessed by Bioanalyzer and
subsequently by qPCR using the Illumina Library
Quantification Kit from Kapa on a Roche Light Cycler
LC480II according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
The template DNA was denatured according to the
protocol described in the Illumina User Guide and
loaded at 12 pM concentration. To improve sequen-
cing quality control, 1% PhiX was spiked-in. The se-
quencing was undertaken on the Illumina HiSeq 2500
with version 4 chemistry generating 2 × 125 bp paired-
end reads. Base calling and de-multiplexing of indexed
reads was performed by CASAVA version 1.8.2 (Illu-
mina) to produce all the sequence data in fastq format.
The raw fastq files were trimmed to remove Illumina
adapter sequences using Cutadapt version 1.2.1 [42]. The
option ‘-O 3’ was set, so the 3′ end of any reads which
matched the adapter sequence over at least 3 bp was
trimmed off. The reads were further trimmed to re-
move low-quality bases, using Sickle version 1.200 with
a minimum window quality score of 20. After trim-
ming,
reads
shorter
than
10
bp
were
removed.
Trimmed R1/R2 read pairs were mapped to the human
reference genome assembly GRCh38 (ftp://ftp.ensem-
bl.org/pub/release-77/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_-
sapiens.GRCh38.dna_sm.primary_assembly.fa.gz) using
TopHat2 version 2.1.0 [43, 44], which calls the mapper
Bowtie2 version 2.0.10 [44]. Paired-end mapping was car-
ried out using option ‘-g 1’
, ‘–library-type fr-secondstrand’
,
‘–mate-inner-dist 160’ and ‘–mate-std-dev 60’
, which in-
structs TopHat2 to allow a maximum of one alignment to
the reference for a given read, choosing the alignment
with the best alignment scores if there is more than one
or discarding the read if there is more than one equally
good alignment.
The alignments were used for calculating read counts
per gene using HTSeq-count (http://www-huber.embl.de/
users/anders/HTSeq/doc/count.html).
The raw
counts
generated from HTSeq-count were imported into the R
environment to carry out differential expression analysis
using edgeR [45] for contrasting acute when tested and
survived (acute survivor), acute when tested and died
(acute fatal) and acute (either fatal or survived) compared
to convalescent controls. Differentially expressed genes
with a FDR < 5% and an absolute log2 fold change > 1 were
finally reported. Details on the sample numbers are pro-
vided in the text and in Table 1.
Informatic analysis
Three criteria were used to identify sample quality: (1)
removal of low-quality samples from the dataset such
that all samples eventually selected had over ~10% of
reads mapping to the human genome; (2) calculation of
the correlation coefficient of each remaining sample
against any other samples within each groups and the
scatter plot of all correlation coefficient values was plot-
ted for the fatal and survivor groups; and (3) a cutoff of
a mean correlation coefficient of 0.8 was selected based
on the distribution and any samples with a mean correl-
ation coefficient of less than 0.8 were eliminated.
To identify gene expression signatures for predicting
outcomes of Ebola patients, a machine learning ap-
proach was used (SVM) function in R package ‘e1071’
[46]. These were based on the ten genes either with the
highest fold change or most significant identification.
The performance of predictions was assessed following a
leave-one-out cross-validation approach. The prediction
performances were assessed by using R package ‘ROCR’
[47] through ROC curves and Accuracy-FPR (False Posi-
tive Rate) plots (see Additional file 7).
To perform the expansion substitution method to
identify an optimal classifier, first, the total gene set
was reduced to a search space containing only genes
that were differentially expressed from convalescent
controls to acute-fatal or convalescent controls to
acute-survivors. Then, for each iteration, ten genes
were selected at random to be the starting profile set.
Each gene in the search space was substituted for a profile
gene and the correlation within groups (acute-fatal to
acute-fatal and acute-survivor to acute-survivor) and
between groups (acute-fatal to acute-survivor) was calcu-
lated. If the new gene substitution improved the within-
group
correlation
and
decreased
the
between-group
correlation, the new profile set was selected. This was run
until convergence was reached and a last profile gene set
was generated. The whole process was run 50 times. The
final profile set included the genes that showed up the
most in a last gene set. Finally, the accuracy of the classi-
fier was determined by leave-one-out cross-validation
where a sample was classified as acute-survivor or acute-
fatal based on the correlation to the acute-fatal group or
the acute-survivor group. The bias estimations were per-
formed using the boot function in R for 100 iterations. A
cutoff value for the correlation was determined at each cv
Liu et al. Genome Biology  (2017) 18:4 
Page 13 of 17
 step and if the sample fell below the cutoff line, it was clas-
sified as acute-fatal and above acute-survivor. Training
and testing of the model was performed in the original
dataset of 112 samples. The trained model was then used
in a validation dataset of 20 independent samples.
Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
The p value was calculated by Fisher’s exact test right-
tailed, which indicated the probability of association of
molecules from the dataset with the canonical pathway
by random chance alone. The Z-score was used to
mathematically compare the dataset with the canonical
pathway patterns, taking into account the activation
state of one of more key molecules when the pathway
was activated and also the molecules’ causal relation-
ships with each other. This is a Quant-based test that
determined if canonical pathways, including functional
endpoints, were increased or decreased based on differ-
entially expressed genes or proteins in the dataset.
Digital cell quantification
To determine relative cell type quantities from count
data, we used DCQ through the R-package ComICS
[21]. The default parameters were used with 500 repeats
and a split ratio of 50% on an input dataset of fold
changes compared to controls (acute-fatal to controls
and acute-survivors to controls). All 207 cell types were
analysed. The resulting data provided a predicted mean
relative abundance as well as the standard deviation of
the mean. To determine cell types that were significantly
different from zero, a standard t-test was performed with
a p value cutoff of 0.05. Definition of immune subsets is
based on ImmGen database information and thus repre-
sents previously validated mouse equivalents to human
immune cells [48–50].
Study samples for flow cytometry analysis
RT-PCR was performed on EDTA-blood of patients with
suspected EVD using the RealStar Zaire Ebolavirus RT-
PCR Kit 1.0 (Altona Diagnostics). EVD-positive patients
(n = 37) included in the study were diagnosed by the
European Mobile Laboratory unit at the ETC Coyah and
were medically attended by medical teams deployed by
the Cuban government. Patients with Plasmodium co-
infection were excluded from the study. Additionally,
ten febrile EVD-negative controls and five patients diag-
nosed with malaria were included in the study. Malaria
was diagnosed using a rapid test. Leftover samples from
diagnostics were shipped within 24 h after collection to
our
immunology
laboratory
at
Donka
Hospital
in
Conakry and processed immediately. Peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated after red
blood cell lysis (BD Biosciences). Immune phenotyping
was done by flow cytometry using the following antibodies:
CD16-PE (3G8), CD3-PerCP/Cy5.5 (SK7), CD19-PerCP/
Cy5.5 (HIB19), CD56-PerCP/Cy5.5 (HCD56), HLA-DR-
PE/Cy7 (L243), CD14-APC (HCD14), CD11c-PB (Bu15),
CD14-BV510
(M5E2),
CD141-PE
(M80),
CD1c-APC
(L161), CD16-APC/Cy7 (3G8). All antibodies were from
Biolegend. Live/Dead cell discrimination was done with
Zombie NIR staining (Biolegend). After Live/Dead cell
staining, PBMCs were treated with FACS block (Human
TruStain Fc receptor blocking antibodies from Biolegend)
for 20 min followed by extracellular antibody staining.
Samples were afterwards inactivated in Cytofix/Cytoperm
(BD) buffer in the presence of 4% formaldehyde. Sam-
ple acquisition was done in a Guava easyCyte 8 Flow
Cytometer from Millipore. Flow cytometry analysis was
done with FlowJo software (Treestar). Non-parametric
statistics was performed in Graphpad Prism software as
described in the legend to Fig. 3.
Human DCQ
The human cell compendium for DCQ used a micro-
array dataset of FACS-separated human immune cells
(GSE24759). The data were read into R and normalised
using the ‘affy’ package and RMA normalisation. Then,
the log normalised values for each cell type were aver-
aged for each gene and each gene was then normalised
by the median and standard deviation. A list of surface
markers was selected based on the FACS separating
markers used and other known surface markers for the
given cell type. This list of surface markers and the new
normalised dataset was read into DCQ along with the
fold change data. To determine significance, a standard
t-test was performed on the mean and standard devi-
ation of the output.
Non-human primate data
The NHP data were taken from GEO GSE64538. This
dataset contained RNA-seq in PBMCs from vaccinated
and unvaccinated animals at various time points during
viral challenge. Data were read into R and using edgeR
and normalised for library size. DE data were calculated
using the negative binomial. Fold changes were calculated
by first normalising to the pre-infection control for vacci-
nated and unvaccinated animals and then taking the un-
vaccinated 7 dpi animals over the vaccinated 7 dpi.
RF method for phenotypic prediction applied to the
Ebola dataset
The list of all genes was split into six strata and the R
package ‘randomForest’ was used on expression data for
each strata, with patients’ status marked as either Sur-
vivor or Fatal. Classification was undertaken separately
for the six strata and the data were pooled and genes
were ranked to identify the top ten genes which were
used as biomarker genes. Finally, the patients’ outcome

 prediction based on the top ten genes was performed
using the ‘randomForest’ method.

on the optimised selection of representative multi-gene

See Additional file 11 for a full description of this method.
Bootstrapping
Bootstrapping for both RF and PGP predictive models
was deployed using the R function ‘boot’ with 1000 re-
samplings set to generate 1000 estimates of prediction
accuracy. Bootstrapping
was
set
in
‘non-parameter’
mode and patient outcome was presented in the func-
tion argument ‘strata’.
The bootstrapping results are depicted in Additional
file 9, with the left panel providing a histogram of pre-
diction accuracy over the 1000 replications. The right
panel shows the QQplot of prediction accuracy against
the standard normal distribution, the linearity indicat-
ing the extent to which the accuracy distribution is rep-
resented by a normal distribution.
