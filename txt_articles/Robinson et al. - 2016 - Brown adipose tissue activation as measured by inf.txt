was compared to a repeated assessment, where the MA test was substituted for a
period of relaxation. Although MA did not elicit an acute stress response, anticipation

ABSTRACT 
Brown adipose tissue (BAT) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity, type-
2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and is a potential therapeutic target. BAT can 
have a significant impact on energy balance and glucose homeostasis through the 
action of uncoupling protein (UCP)1, dissipating chemical energy as heat following 
neuro-endocrine stimulation. We hypothesised that psychological stress, which is 
known to promote cortisol secretion, would simultaneously activate BAT at 
thermoneutrality. BAT activity was measured using infrared thermography to 
determine changes in temperature of the skin overlying supraclavicular BAT (TSCR). 
A mild psychological stress was induced in five healthy, lean, female, Caucasian 
volunteers using a short mental arithmetic (MA) test. TSCR was compared to a 
repeated assessment, where the MA test was substituted for a period of relaxation. 
Although MA did not elicit an acute stress response, anticipation of MA testing led to 
an increased in salivary cortisol, indicative of an anticipatory stress response, that was 
associated with a trend towards higher absolute and relative TSCR. A positive 
correlation between TSCR and cortisol was found during the anticipatory phase, a 
relationship that was enhanced by raised cortisol linked to MA. Our findings suggest 
that subtle changes in the level of psychological stress can stimulate BAT, findings 
that may account for the high variability and inconsistency in reported BAT 
prevalence and activity measured by other modalities. Consistent assessment of this 
uniquely metabolic tissue is fundamental to the discovery of potential therapeutic 
strategies against metabolic disease.

INTRODUCTION 
There is increasing evidence that brown adipose tissue (BAT) has an important 
physiological role beyond that of thermoregulation in newborn infants and rodents 
(Ouellet et al., 2012; Cypess et al., 2014; Sidossis & Kajimura, 2015). Adult humans 
thus have significant amounts of BAT (Cypess et al., 2009; van Marken Lichtenbelt et 
al., 2009; Virtanen et al., 2009) and as a highly metabolic tissue with the capacity to 
oxidise both glucose and lipid, attention has turned to its involvement in the 
pathogenesis of obesity, type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome (Nedergaard & 
Cannon, 2010).  
 
Characterised by the presence of uncoupling protein (UCP)1, this unique 
mitochondrial protein uncouples the respiratory chain from the production of ATP, 
allowing the dissipation of excess chemical energy as heat (Cannon & Nedergaard, 
2004). In adult humans, UCP1 containing adipose tissues have been identified 
primarily in the neck and upper thorax (Virtanen et al., 2009; Zingaretti et al., 2009; 
Jespersen et al., 2013), around the kidneys (Svensson et al., 2014) and heart (Sacks et 
al., 2009), and UCP1 also appears to be inducible in depots classically considered to 
be white (Sidossis et al., 2015). Importantly, when the amount of BAT is reduced, or 
is dysfunctional, excess adiposity can occur (Feldmann et al., 2009; Vijgen et al., 
2011). Several studies have demonstrated not only lower BAT activity in obese 
individuals as compared to those who are lean, but also reduced UCP1 (Vijgen et al., 
2011; Carey et al., 2014), and a negative association between BAT activity and body 
mass index (BMI) (Saito et al., 2009; Pfannenberg et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 
2014).  
 5 
 
 
BAT is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, and is activated directly 
by catecholamines through β-adrenoreceptor signaling (Cannon & Nedergaard, 2004) 
and in humans this response can be mimicked using pharmacological stimulation with 
the β3-adrenergic agonist mirabegron (Cypess et al., 2015). In addition, there is 
indirect evidence of active BAT under basal conditions from the observation that 
active noradrenaline uptake within supraclavicular BAT under warm conditions is 
correlated with core body temperature (Hwang et al., 2015). The presence of BAT has 
largely been determined from the increased uptake of radiolabelled glucose during 
PET-CT during cold exposure of fasted subjects (van Marken Lichtenbelt et al., 2009; 
Virtanen et al., 2009). However, the extent to which BAT activity can be promoted 
under more normal physiological conditions has been less well studied, as this cannot 
be readily achieved using PET-CT. Alternative approaches are therefore needed to 
explore the regulation of BAT and investigate the effects of potential therapeutic 
agents. Infrared thermography is able to functionally assess BAT in adults and 
children by measuring changes in skin temperature overlying the main BAT depot in 
humans (Lee et al., 2011; Symonds et al., 2012) that has now been shown to appear 
similar to that shown by PET-CT (Salem et al., 2015). Furthermore, due to the low 
variability in measurements between subjects (Symonds et al., 2012) it can be used to 
undertake studies in comparatively small subject groups. Infrared thermography thus 
has the potential to elucidate the mechanisms by which BAT activation occurs and 
thus optimise metabolic health. On the other hand, thermography can be affected by 
cutaneous vasoconstriction, that can be modulated by the sympathetic nervous 
system, in addition to changes in ambient temperature (Greaney et al., 2015).  
 
 6 
 
FDG uptake in BAT has also been shown to be affected by psychological state prior 
to scanning, such that simple relaxation measures (exposure to audiovisual 
intervention) resulted in a significant reduction in BAT activity (Vogel et al., 2012). 
The aim of our study was therefore to determine whether mild psychological stress 
would acutely promote supraclavicular BAT activity detectable using dynamic 
thermal imaging in subjects maintained within a warm environment. We hypothesised 
that exposure to a short mental arithmetic (MA) test would elicit an acute stress 
response, thereby activating BAT thermogenesis.

METHODS 
Following University of Nottingham School of Medicine Ethics Committee approval, 
five lean Caucasian females aged between 21-29 years gave written informed consent 
to participate in the study. The study conformed to the standards set by the 
Declaration of Helsinki. The experimental protocol and study equipment were 
demonstrated to each study participant at least 24 hours prior to the initial study 
session to ensure familiarisation. All subjects were fasted from midnight, study 
sessions commenced between 0800 and 0900, and thermography commenced at least 
60 minutes following waking. We aimed to induce mild psychological stress using a 
short MA test, and anticipated that in addition to our intervention this visit would 
engender more stress than the second due to the anticipation of the test.  Therefore, 
we coupled the stressful intervention with the first visit, and the relaxing intervention 
with the second.  By keeping the order of interventions identical between participants, 
we increased the internal consistency of the results, maximising the power to detect a 
difference due to stress. 
 
At the start of the first study session, subjects were informed that they would be 
undertaking a short two minute MA test (Memon et al., 2013) during which they 
would receive real time verbal feedback regarding their performance. Subjects were 
unaware, however, that those answering more than two successive questions correctly 
would be told that their next answer was incorrect regardless of the answer given. The 
second study session was undertaken at least 48 hours after the first and was identical 
in every respect to the MA session, other than the MA test was substituted for a two 
minute relaxation video (R), participants were aware of this from the beginning of the 
second study session.  
 8 
 
 
Both study sessions consisted of an acclimatisation period of 30 minutes where 
subjects were asked to sit comfortably at rest with their supraclavicular region 
exposed, following which a 30 minute baseline period was recorded in which 
supraclavicular skin temperature and mean skin temperature were measured and 
samples of saliva taken for cortisol measurement. On completion of baseline 
measurements, either two minutes of MA or R was undertaken followed by a further 
period of 50 minutes consisting of thermography and salivary sampling as 
summarised in Figure 1.  
 
TSCR was measured using infrared thermography (FLIR B425; FLIR Systems, 
Danderyd, Sweden), and utilised as an indicator of BAT activity as described 
previously (Symonds et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2014). A region of interest (ROI) 
was defined as that bound by the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, clavicle and lateral 
contour of the neck using ThermaCAM Researcher Pro 2.10. These were then 
exported into Excel to calculate the 97.5th percentile temperature value of the ROI. 
Images were taken in triplicate at each designated time point, and at intervals prior to 
and following MA/R testing (Figure 1). TSCR at each time point was calculated as the 
average value derived from the triplicate images. Baseline was defined as mean 
temperature of the 10 minutes preceding MA or R. Mean skin temperature (TMSK) was 
evaluated using measurements of skin temperature obtained from wireless data 
loggers (iButton - model no. DS1219H-F50, Maxim, Sunnyvale, California) placed at 
seven body sites (i.e. forehead, trunk, arm, hand, lower leg, thigh, foot) and calculated 
using the Hardy-Du Bois formula (Hardy & Oppel, 1938). TSCR was adjusted for the 
 9 
 
local effect of ambient temperature by calculating the difference between TSCR and 
TMSK. 
 
Salivary cortisol samples were taken using small cotton swabs (Salivette®, Sarstdet, 
Germany) 10 minutes, and immediately, prior to MA or R and at 10, 20, 30, 40 and 
50 minutes post intervention. These were stored at -80°C until analysis using a 
commercially available ELISA kit designed for use on human saliva samples (Kit no. 
1-3002, Salimetrics, UK). A total of 70 samples were analysed and inter-assay and 
intra-assay precisions were less than 10%.  
 
Statistical Analysis 
Data was assessed for normality using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test and is 
presented as mean ± standard error (SEM) unless otherwise stated. Comparisons 
between data obtained during MA and R testing at single time points were made using 
a paired t-test. Pearson product moment correlation coefficients were calculated to 
determine the correlation between salivary cortisol levels and TSCR. To determine the 
effect of MA and R over time, two-way repeated measures ANOVA was undertaken 
with Sidak’s post-hoc multiple comparisons test.

RESULTS 
All subjects were lean Caucasian females, with an average height, weight and BMI of 
1.70±0.04m, 65.6±5.05 kg and 22.2±0.95 kg/m2 respectively. Ambient room 
temperature did not differ between the MA and R study sessions and was on average 
22.8±0.2°C. A summary of these anthropometric measures and room conditions are 
shown in Table 1.  
  
Salivary cortisol response 
Anticipation of MA was associated with significantly higher salivary cortisol 
concentrations at 10 minutes prior to the test compared to the relaxation film (i.e. 
0.62±0.17 versus 0.25±0.05 μg/dL, p=0.004), confirming that anticipation alone was 
sufficient to act as a mild psychological stressor. Then after administration of either 
MA or R, salivary cortisol decreased (Figure 2). Although there was a continued trend 
towards higher levels prior to MA (0.41±0.11 versus 0.21±0.05 μg/dL), this 
difference was no longer statistically significant (p=0.09).  
 
Anticipation of MA is associated with increased supraclavicular temperature 
A trend for higher absolute value of TSCR prior to MA (as compared to R) was also 
observed at 20 minutes (TSCR 34.9±0.2°C versus 34.6±0.1°C, p=0.09). Furthermore, 
following adjustment for ambient temperature by calculating the difference between 
TSCR and TMSK (TDiff = TSCR - TMSK), a significantly greater TDiff was observed at both 
20 minutes and 10 minutes prior to MA testing (Figure 3) indicating that anticipation 
of MA testing was associated with a relatively higher TSCR. 
 
 11 
 
Supraclavicular temperature increases following MA and R and is associated 
with baseline TSCR and salivary cortisol concentration 
Unexpectedly, TSCR rose significantly from baseline in the subjects attending for R 
(Figure 4). Two-way repeated measures ANOVA identified a significant effect of 
time (p=0.004) with no effect of psychological stress. Sidak’s post hoc multiple 
comparisons test revealed the effects of time were observed at 30, 40 and 50 minutes 
and were limited to the R session (Figure 4C and 4D). In contrast to the changes in 
TSCR, TMSK were seen to fall significantly over time in both study sessions by 30 
minutes in the response period, suggestive of a drop in overall body skin temperature 
(Figure 4E and 4F). Figures 4A and 4B further demonstrate representative changes in 
TSCR visualised as thermograms between baseline and post MA or R testing at 50 
minutes with no change with MA but an increase in R.  
 
Furthermore, when the maximal change in TSCR (ΔTSCRmax) was considered, 
although small significant increases in TSCR were observed following in both the MA 
and R testing, no significant difference was observed between the two sets of 
experimental conditions (ΔTSCRmax – R; 0.54±0.15°C versus ΔTSCRmax – MA; 
0.44±0.05°C, p=0.5). A negative correlation was observed between baseline TSCR and 
ΔTSCRmax (Pearson’s r=-0.72, p=0.017) indicating that the degree of maximal 
temperature change over time was inversely related to the baseline starting value of 
TSCR (Figure 5). A significant positive correlation was observed between paired 
measures of TSCR and salivary cortisol at 10 minutes prior to MA testing, but not prior 
to R (Figure 6).

DISCUSSION 
We have shown that mild anticipatory psychological stress induced by the expectation 
of MA testing increased supraclavicular skin temperature that is indicative of raised 
BAT activity (Jang et al., 2014; Salem et al., 2015). This finding is therefore 
supportive of a significant impact of anxiety on BAT, as suggested previously from 
studies in both humans (Hwang et al., 2015) and rodents (Lkhagvasuren et al., 2011; 
Mohammed et al., 2014). Furthermore, we have shown that irrespective of the cause 
elevated cortisol is strongly correlated with supraclavicular temperature. This finding 
is in accord with the previously suggested role of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
axis in sensing energy balance and caloric flow (Kirschbaum et al., 1997). It has also 
been recently shown in rodents that the dorsomedial hypothalamic node bifurcates 
stress signaling to the sympathetic outflow to promote BAT thermogenesis as well as 
to the endocrine outflow thereby promoting stress hormone release (including 
corticoids) through the HPA-axis (Kataoka et al., 2014)..  
 
In our study, MA testing per se did not elicit the acute stress response we had 
expected. However, all but one subject was educated to post-graduate level, and 
scored highly on the MA test, suggesting it was not sufficiently challenging. 
Interestingly, we also observed an increase in TSCR over the 50 minutes following MA 
and R, whilst the maximal change from baseline did not differ between the two 
experimental conditions. Consequently, these effects appear to be more pronounced 
following R. TSCR when first recorded was also lower prior to R, which is indicative 
of lower baseline BAT thermogenesis. As TSCR increased during both MA and R, and 
salivary cortisol measures did not increase in line with an MA induced acute stress 
response, further BAT stimulation must have occurred by an alternative mechanism. 
 13 
 
It should be noted that for successful thermography subjects must remain still, such 
that despite imaging being undertaken fully clothed in a warm comfortable room, 
subjects may gradually cool down due to a reduction in non-exercise activity 
thermogenesis (NEAT). In support of this theory is the reduction in mean skin 
temperature we observed particularly in the R intervention. The MA group, with their 
higher TSCR at baseline seemed better able to maintain their overall body temperature, 
such that BAT thermogenesis recruited during the anticipatory phase was sufficient to 
offset any reduction in NEAT, or represents maximally stimulated BAT at baseline. 
Further studies conducted at cooler ambient temperatures could now be undertaken to 
investigate this further. 
 
Whilst the effect of catecholamines on BAT thermogenesis has been well 
characterised in rodents (Cannon & Nedergaard, 2004), and has been observed in 
humans with pathological adrenergic excess (Nagano et al., 2015), and subjects 
exposed to therapeutic intervention (Cypess et al., 2015), our understanding of the 
endocrine control of human BAT in the physiological state is less well understood. A 
role for anxiety, or anticipatory stress has also been suggested from the finding that 
administration of anxiolytic pre-medications such as propranolol diminishes the 
“unwanted” BAT glucose uptake signal in patients undergoing clinical PET-CT 
scanning (Gelfand et al., 2005; Jacobsson et al., 2005) as does exposure to relaxing 
audio-visual imagery (Vogel et al., 2012). A potential role for cortisol in BAT 
function has not been previously shown in adults in vivo, and whilst the increase in 
cortisol observed in our study most likely represents the overall neuroendocrine 
response to acute stress (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activation), including a 
concomitant increase in systemic circulating catecholamines. Our novel observation 
 14 
 
that cortisol was positively correlated with TSCR, in conjunction with in vitro studies 
in humans, (Barclay et al., 2015) highlight the effect of cortisol on human BAT as an 
interesting avenue for future investigation.  
 
Rodent studies, both in vitro (Soumano et al., 2000; Viengchareun et al., 2001) and in 
vivo have reported that glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on classical BAT, 
suppressing thermogenesis (Strack et al., 1995), although these must be interpreted 
with caution as they were not undertaken at thermoneutrality (Celi et al., 2015). It 
should be noted that endocrine factors suggested to stimulate BAT function in rodents 
may not necessarily have the same role in humans. For example, it has recently been 
shown that the 10 fold rise in plasma FGF21 with prolonged fasting in humans is 
accompanied with reduced BAT function (Fazeli et al., 2015). Moreover, in rodents a 
dose 10 times higher than this is required to induce changes in BAT activity (Kwon et 
al.). 
 
Cortisol is, however, known to have an important role in promoting maximal BAT 
function around the time of birth, although whether this is a direct effect or mediated 
by changes in thyroid hormones remains to be fully established (Mostyn et al., 2003).  
Direct effects of exogenous cortisol administration on human BAT activity have yet 
to be shown, but hypercortisolaemia induced by exogenous administration of 
hydrocortisone results in a significant increase in energy expenditure (Brillon et al., 
1995). Whether this is mediated by BAT remains to be elucidated although we have 
recently shown that a 24h infusion of hydrocortisone into adult men of normal weight 
stimulates BAT function (H Scotney, ME Symonds, J Law, H Budge, D Sharkey and 
K Manolopoulos 2015, unpublished results). Dexamethasone stimulates the 
 15 
 
proliferation and differentiation and function of human brown adipocytes in vitro 
(Barclay et al., 2015). This suggests that metabolic manifestations of Cushing’s 
syndrome could be related, in part. to the effect of hypercortisolaemia on BAT, such 
that the characteristic of regional excess adiposity (e.g. the buffalo hump) represent 
hyperproliferation of BAT as recently suggested from the response to trauma in 
subcutaneous adipose tissue following severe burning (Sidossis et al., 2015).  
 
In conclusion, our findings have important implications in the study of BAT under 
supposedly basal conditions as it is clear that quite subtle changes in psychological 
stress, including anticipation, can stimulate the production of heat from BAT within 
the supraclavicular depot. This may explain why functional measurements of BAT 
measured using PET-CT are not directly confirmed with comparable changes in BAT 
temperature (Jang et al., 2014) and further highlights the need for caution when 
interpreting such results. Our findings if repeated in larger subject groups could 
therefore enable novel interventions linked to mild stress in order to promote BAT 
function.
