Key Points
• tTregs express high miR-
146b levels and downregulate
TRAF6 mRNA and NF-kB
activation, which is essential
for tTreg function.
• miR-146b antagomir
enhances in vitro and in vivo
tTreg suppression and
persistence as well as
xenogenic GVHD lethality.
CD41CD251FoxP31 thymic-derived regulatory T cells (tTregs) are indispensable for
maintaining immune system equilibrium. Adoptive transfer of tTregs is an effective
means of suppressing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in murine models and in early
human clinical trials. Tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), an
ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme that mediates nuclear factor kB (NF-kB) activation, plays
an essential role in modulating regulatory T cell survival and function. MicroRNAs
(miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs, which mediate RNA silencing and posttranscriptional
gene repression. By performing comprehensive TaqMan Low Density Array miRNA
assays, we identified 10 miRNAs differentially regulated in human tTreg compared with
control T cells. One candidate, miR-146b, is preferentially and highly expressed in human
naive tTregs compared with naive CD4 T cells. miRNA prediction software revealed that
TRAF6 was the one of the top 10 scored mRNAs involved tTreg function with the highest
probability as a potential miR-146b target. Antagomir-mediated knockdown of miRNA-
146b, but not another miRNA-146 family member (miRNA-146a), enhanced TRAF6
expression. TRAF6, in turn, increases NF-kB activation, which is essential for tTreg function as well as Foxp3 protein and
antiapoptotic gene expression, and downregulates proapoptotic gene expression. miR-146b knockdown increased the nuclear
localization and expression of genes regulated by NF-kB, which was associated with enhanced tTreg survival, proliferation, and
suppressive function measured in vitro and in vivo. TRAF6 inhibition had the opposite effects. We conclude that an miR-146b–TRAF6-
NF-kB–FoxP3 signaling pathway restrains regulatory T cell survival, proliferation, and suppressor function. In vitro exposure of
human tTregs to miR-146b antagomirs can be exploited to improve the clinical efficacy of human adoptive tTreg transfer in a GVHD
setting. (Blood. 2016;128(10):1424-1435)
Introduction
Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a multi–organ system complica-
tion of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation that is due to
unperturbed donor anti–host T cell destructive responses.1-3 Immuno-
suppressive drugs are used to prevent GVHD but have been neither
uniformly successful nor free of significant side effects. CD41CD251
thymic-derived regulatory T cells (tTregs), which express the
transcription factor FoxP3 (positive) and are CD127 low, control
immune homeostasis. In rodents, donor graft tTreg supplementation
has been shown to be highly effective in suppressing GVHD
lethality.4-6Intheclinic,theinfusionoftTregs canreduce theincidence
and severity of acute GVHD.6-10 High ratios of donor tTregs to
conventionalTcellswereneededformaximalGVHDprotection.Thus,
an approach to imbue tTregs with stronger suppressive function
and proliferative ability would be beneficial for preventing GVHD as
well as preventing solid organ graft rejection or treating autoimmune
disease.11,12
MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a family of ;22-nt noncoding RNAs,
regulate gene expression by binding to messenger RNA (mRNA)
though nucleotides at the 59 end of the miRNA. They operate on RNA
silencing and posttranscriptional gene repression by matching with the
seed region, mostly situated at positions 2 to 7 from the miRNA 59 end,
and are essential for binding of the miRNA to the mRNA.13,14 Multi-
ple mechanisms have been implicated in tTreg development and
suppressive function, including more recently miRNA’s effects on

 posttranscriptional gene regulation.15-18 The miR-146 family includes
2 main members, miR-146a and miR-146b, which are both highly
expressed and play important roles in cell proliferation and function in
diversecell types, including T and B cells. Studies of breast cancer cells

of nuclear factor kB (NF-kB). Even though they share the same seed
regions, posttranscriptional processing mechanisms and consequently
functions may be distinct due to different genomic locations
(chromosomes 5 and 10, respectively). Whereas activation of NF-kB
negatively correlates with miR-146a expression, miR-146b-5p is
induced by cytokines that activate signal transducer and activator of
transcription 3 (STAT30 (interleukin-6 [IL-6]) or STAT1 (interferon-g
[IFN-g]).20-23 Lipopolysaccharide induction of miR-146a was ob-
served in bone marrow–derived macrophages, but IL-10 release from
macrophages leads to expression of miR-146b, but not miR-146a,
suggestingdifferentsignalingpathwaysformiR-146aandmiR-146b.24
Knockout of miR-146a results in excessive regulatory T cell (Treg)
IFN-g production and reduced Treg-mediated Th1 response inhibition,
resulting in fatal autoimmune disease.25 Furthermore, CD41 T cells
were moderately reduced in miR-146b, but not miR-146a, transgenic
mice due to impaired ability to expand in response to T cell receptor
(TCR) stimulation.26 TRAF6 plays an essential role in NF-kB
activation and Treg proliferation and function. TRAF6 deficiency
results in immune tolerance imbalance and autoimmune disease.27,28
Although TRAF6 is a predicted target of miR-146a/b in human and
murine tumor cells29,30 and Tregs in mice,25 no significant correlation
has been observed between miR-146a and TRAF6 in human T cells.31
Thus, identifying the roles of miRNA-146b–regulated pathways in
tTregs, which might be distinct from miR-146a, could further be used
to enhance Treg suppressive function and/or stability and improve the
therapeutic potential of Treg adoptive cell therapy.
By performing comprehensive TaqMan Low Density Array
miRNA assays, we identified 10 miRNAs differentially regulated in
human tTregs compared with control T cells that might play important
roles in Treg stability and function. We demonstrate that knockdown
of miR-146b increases TRAF6 expression in human tTregs, leading
to NF-kB activation and enhanced FoxP3 expression, suppressive
function, and proliferative ability in vitro and in vivo. Together, these
data provide both an insight into human tTreg function and a new
approach in the clinic to improve the efficacy of tTregs in preventing
GVHD.
Materials and methods
More information regarding mice, cell purification and culture, flow cytometry,
Imagestream analysis, gene expression analysis, the miRNA target prediction
and reporter assay, the suppression assay, xenogenic GVHD studies, and
statistics can be found in supplemental Materials and methods (available on the
Blood Web site).
Treatment of tTregs and CD41 T cells
tTregs and CD41 T-cell cultures, generated as described in supplemental
Methods, were frozen on days 14 and 7, respectively. Frozen cells were thawed
and restimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibody–coated Dynabeads
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Carlsbad, CA) at 1:3 (cell-to-bead) ratios in the
presence of recombinant IL-2. After 6 days, cultures were washed and
resuspended at 1 3 106 cells/mL, and nanoparticle-encapsulated RNA (50 nM
scramble/antagomir; EXIQON, Woburn, MA; supplemental Table 2), TRAF6
inhibitor (8 mM; EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany), or NF-kB inhibitor
(3 mM or 6 mM PS-1145; Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA) was
added. Dimethylsulfoxide as the vehicle used as a control. Cells were cultured
for another 2 days without further manipulation and harvested and assayed as
listed. For some experiments, tTregs were kept in culture longer (as indicated)
without further antagomir addition.
Results
Identification of human tTreg-specific miRNA
Changes in miRNA expression are observed during T-cell differenti-
ation.32 To identify potential human tTreg-specific miRNA, we
compared miRNA expression between in vitro–expanded naive CD4
T cells (CD41252127145RA1; control T cells) and naive tTregs
(CD412511127245RA1). TaqMan Low Density Array was used to
reveal differential miRNA expression between human naive tTregs
and CD4 T cells. RNU44, an ubiquitously expressed small nucleolar
RNA, was used to normalize expression between the cell types. After
analyzing 768 miRNAs by ranking fold expression, the top 10 dif-
ferential miRNAs between tTregs and CD4 T cells were chosen for
further analysis (Figure 1A). Two miRNAs, which were preferentially
expressed(.10.0-fold)intTregs(miR-146a-5pandmiR-142-3p),have
been implicated in tTreg development and/or function. miR-146a-5p
has proved to be essential for Treg development, phenotype, and
function, while miR-142-3p negatively regulates tTreg suppressive
function by restricting the AC9/cyclic adenosine 59-monophosphate
pathway.25,33-35FourmiRNAs(miR-29a-3p,miR-19b-3p,miR-150-5p,
and miR-146b-5p), which had differential expression .2.0-fold, also
have known functions in tTregs; miR-29a and miR-150 promote Treg
differentiation, while miR-19b negatively regulates Treg induction
from naive T cells.18,36-39
miR-146b-5p drew our attention for deeper investigation. Although
some reports found miR-146a-5p positively regulates tTreg function
in mice,25 others found miR-146a and/or 146b knockdown had no
impact on human Treg function.40 Therefore, we hypothesized that
miR-146b-5pandmiR-146a-5pmighthaveoppositerolesincontrolling
tTreg function. To confirm the higher expression in tTregs, differential
expression of miR-146b-5p was validated by quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Figure 1B) and
hence chosen for this study.
Knockdown of miR-146b-5p enhances FoxP3 expression,
viability, expansion and suppressive function in vitro
To determine whether miR-146b-5p affected human tTreg phenotype
or suppressive function, tTregs were incubated with nanoparticle-
encapsulated miR-146b-5p antagomir as described in supplemental
materials and Methods.Scrambled miRNA was used as a control.miR-
146b-5p knockdown efficiency was $95% (Figure 2A) as assessed by
quantitative RT-PCR.KnockdownofmiR-146b-5pin tTregs increased

with the scrambled group. We also compared the in vitro suppressive
function of untreated tTregs with those treated with scrambled or miR-
146b-5p antagomir. Using a carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl
ester (CFSE)-based proliferation assay with tTreg to peripheral blood
mononuclear cell (PBMC) ratios ranging from 1:8 to 1:32, antagomir
treatment was found to significantly enhance tTreg suppressive
function at each tTreg:PBMC ratio tested (Figure 2E), with an
approximately twofold increase in efficacy (ie, antagomir-treated

 tTregs at 1:16 were as suppressive as scramble-treated tTregs at 1:8).
OnepreviousstudysuggestedthatCD4TcellsfrommiR-146b(butnot
miR-146a) transgenic mice were significantly impaired in their ability
to expand in response to in vitro TCR stimulation due to a combination
of increased apoptosis and a defective entrance into S phase.26
Therefore,wetestedwhethermiR-146b-5pantagomirtreatmentwould
have an impact on in vitro tTreg expansion. Although no significant
difference inexpansion was observedduring the initial 2-day treatment
period, antagomir-treated tTreg cultures showed increased viability
and staining for Ki-67, a marker of proliferation (Figure 2F-H).
Cultures were continued without further antagomir treatment to
assess long-term cell accumulation. By day 8 posttreatment, antagomir-
treated tTregs had expanded significantly more than untreated tTregs or
thosetreatedwithscrambledRNA(supplementalFigure1A).Effectsof
antagomir treatment were durable, as miR-146b expression was still
reduced 70% on day 8 (not shown) and treated tTregs maintained their
higher Foxp3 expression and suppressive function (supplemental
Figure 1B-E). Therefore, knockdown of miR-146b-5p favors FoxP3
expression, expansion, and suppressive function and attenuates
apoptosis protein.
Previous murine studies suggested that miR-146a-5p was involved
in Th1 responses and its deficiency led to dysregulated IFN-g
production.25,41 However, few expanded human tTregs expressed
IFN-g under our conditions, andexpression was not affected by miR-
146b-5pantagomirtreatment(supplementalFigure2).Becausecontrol
CD4 T cells also expressed miR-146b-5p, albeit at low levels, it
seemed possible that downmodulation of this miRNA would induce
Foxp3 expression and suppressive function. Naive CD4 T cells were
purified, expanded in vitro using conditions similar to those in the
original array study, and treated with miR-146-5p antagomir for
the final 2 days. miR-146b antagomir treatment had no effect on
FoxP3 expression or suppressive function in control CD4 T cells
(supplemental Figure 3). We hypothesize that the lack of an effect of
miR-146b antagomir on conventional T cells is likely due to low miR-
146b expression, perhaps related to a lack of Foxp3-mediated miR-
146b expression. Alternatively, this difference could be due to the fact
that TCR signaling, including TRAF6 and NF-kB activation, isknown
to be differentially controlled in conventional T cells compared with
tTreg. In supplemental Figure 3, no increase in suppressive function
was observed. However, a low level of suppression was observed in all
effector T cell cultures. This most likely due to competition for the
stimulatory anti-CD3 beads, especially because the in vitro–expanded
effector T cell cells are already in cycle and are physically larger (and
thus express more TCR) than the T cells present in the directly ex vivo
PBMC cultures. These data indicate that knockdown of miR-146b-5p
in human tTregs, but not control CD4 T cells, increases FoxP3
expression and suppressive function in vitro without increasing IFN-g
production.
TRAF6 is a direct target of miR-146b-5p, and knockdown of
miR-146b-5p increases TRAF6 expression in human tTregs
To identify potential miR-146b targets, we used miRNA prediction
software (targetscan.org, MIRDB.org, and microRNA.org) to reveal
the potential targeted miRNAs. After sorting top 10 predicted miRNAs
in each software package, we found that TRAF6 was the one mRNA
involved tTreg function with highest possibility (Figure 3A). All 3 sets
of software identified potential miR-146b-5p binding sites (7 nt) in the
39 UTR of TRAF6 (Figure 3B). Consistent with this hypothesis,
TRAF6 expression was decreased in miR-146b transgenic mice,26 and
inversely correlated with miR-146b-5p expression in umbilical vein
endothelial cells (HUVECs) and dendritic cells (DCs).42,43 To confirm
the predicted miR-146b-5p binding site in TRAF6, HEK293 cells were
transiently transfected with pGL3 firefly luciferase (ff-luc)reporter
plasmids with no insert, or with the wild-type (WT) or mutated (MUT)
39 UTR sequences of TRAF6 (supplemental Table 1), along with

Furthermore, the specificity of this interaction was confirmed because
miR-146bdidnotsignificantlydecreaseff-lucactivityinHEK293cells
expressing the mutant 39 UTR (Figure 3C, right panels). While miR-
146a and –miR-146b are separate gene products, they share a homol-
ogous seed region. Since miR-146a can also target TRAF6, we
analyzed miR-146a expression following miR-146b antagomir
treatment by quantitative RT-PCR to assess knockdown specificity.
Our data demonstrate that miR-146a expression in tTregs treated
with miR-146b-5p antagomir was similar tothat of tTregs treated with
scramble RNA (supplemental Figure 4).
We next asked whether miR-146b-5p antagomir treatment affected
TRAF6 expression in expanded tTregs. Figure 3D shows that al-
though no effect was observed in the scramble group, tTregs treated
with miR-146b-5p antagomir had significantly higher TRAF6 mRNA
expression. In accordance with mRNA level, antagomir treatment
significantly enhanced TRAF6 protein expression in tTregs compared
with the untreated or scramble-treated groups (Figure 3E). Taken to-
gether, these results show that TRAF6 is a direct target of miR-146b-5p
in human tTregs.
Inhibition of TRAF6 signaling impairs human tTreg expansion
and Foxp3 expression and suppressive function
Conditional knockout of TRAF6 in murine Treg resulted in decreased
Foxp3 stability and loss of in vivo suppressive function.27 We sought
to determine if TRAF6 plays a similar role in human tTreg. In
vitro expanded tTreg were treated with a TRAF6 signaling inhibitor
(6877002)44 for the final 2 days of culture. Similar to reports for
murine tTregs, inhibition of TRAF6 signaling in human tTreg cultures
decreased Foxp3 protein expression both at a population level
(68.0% 6 6.6% vs 46.8% 6 6.8%, P , .05, Figure 4A-B) and on an
individual-cell basis (Figure 4C) compared with the vehicle group.
Suppressive function was markedly downregulated after inhibitor
treatment (Figure 4D). TRAF6 inhibitor also decreased proliferative
ability (as assessed by Ki-67 staining) after 2 days of treatment and
significantlydecreasedcellnumberafter8daysoftreatment(Figure4E-F).
Knockdown of miR-146b-5p increases nuclear localization of
NF-kB, which is key in controlling tTreg function
TRAF6 is critical for TCR-mediated activation of NF-kB and acts by
ubiquitinylating TAK1, leading to activation of IkBa kinase and
destruction of inhibitor of NF-kBa (IkBa), which allows NF-kB
to translocate to the nucleus.45,46 To determine whether miR-146

Figure 3. TRAF6 is a direct target of miR-146b-5p and knock-down of miR-146b-5p increased TRAF6 expression in human tTregs (n 5 3). To assess whether human
miR-146b-5p targets TRAF6, HEK293 cells were transduced with plasmids carrying wild-type (WT) or mutant (MUT) 39 UTR sequences from TRAF6 linked to a luciferase
reporter gene. Cells were also transfected with a Renilla luciferase reporter construct for normalization. (A) Three software packages (targetscan.org, MIRDB, and microRNA.

 tTregs were left untreated or treated for 2 days with scrambled RNA
or miR-146b-5p antagomir; stained for CD4, NF-kB, and DRAQ5
(a nuclear marker); and analyzed using imaging flow cytometry.47 We
acquired a similarity feature to quantify translocation; by this method, a
more compositedand similarimageby 2colorsmeansmore translocation
to the nucleus. NF-kB (in yellow) and DRAQ5 (in red) are shown in
Figure 5A; together with a composite image, we found more similar
images in the antagomir group than the untreated/scramble group.
Following data acquisition, the spatial relationship between NF-kB and
DRAQ5wasmeasuredusingthesimilarityfeatureintheIDEASsoftware
package (Figure 5B).48 Similarity scores measure the pixel intensity
correlation between the anti–NF-kB and DRAQ5 images, and increased
similarity scores indicate increased overlap. As shown in Figure 5C,
antagomir-treated tTregs demonstrated significantly higher similarity
scores than untreated or scramble-treated tTregs, indicating increased
NF-kB nuclear localization. In conclusion, NF-kB localization is reg-
ulated by miR-146b-5p.
NF-kB activation is critical for the development of tTregs in mice
and positively regulates FoxP3 expression.49,50 To address the role of
NF-kB in human tTregs, an inhibitor of the NF-kB pathway (PS1145)
was added for the final 2 days of culture.51 NF-kB inhibition decreased
Foxp3 expression in a dose-dependent manner, leading to significantly
decreased in vitro suppressive function (Figure 5D-G). Therefore,
NF-kB nuclear localization is associated with human tTreg function.
Antagomir-treated tTregs show transcriptional signs of
NF-kB activation
NF-kB activation in T cells results in a series of transcriptional changes
that upregulates metabolism, cell cycle machinery, and prosurvival
pathways. To determine whether the basal increase in NF-kB nuclear
localization observed in antagomir-treated tTregs had transcriptional
consequences, we compared the expression of known NF-kB–
responsive genes in antagomir-treated tTregs with those left untreated
or treated with scramble RNA. One NF-kB target gene, c-myc, is a
crucial regulator of T-cell glycolysis and promotes T-cell activation–
induced growth and proliferation.52,53 Thymocytes from miR-146b
transgenic mice have defective IkB degradation following TCR
stimulation and attenuated induction of c-myc.26,54 As shown in
Figure 6A, antagomir treatment increased c-myc expression more than
threefold over untreated or scramble-treated tTregs. In addition,
consistent with the beneficial effects on viability and expansion,
antagomir-treated tTregs had increased expression of antiapoptotic
members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) and decreased
expression of proapoptotic members (BID and BAX) (Figure 6B-F).

miR-146-5p antagomir treatment significantly increases human
tTreg efficacy and persistence in a xenogeneic model of GVHD
Because miR-146b knockdown enhances tTreg function, expansion,
and survival in vitro, we sought to determine whether miR-146b-5p
antagomir-treated tTregs would be more effective at preventing
xenogeneic GVHD. Ex vivo–expanded tTregs (15 3 106) were
untreated or treated with scramble or antagomir for 2 days, then
injected with allogeneic PBMCs (15 3 106) into NSG mice. As shown
in Figure 7A, all 3 groups of mice receiving tTregs had significantly
reduced GVHD-induced lethality compared with PBMC-onlycontrols

 weight loss (P , .05) between days 15 and 22 and decreased clinical
scoresbetweendays13and22(Figure7BandFigure7C,respectively).
Although mice receiving antagomir-treated tTregs lost less weight and
developed fewer clinical symptoms than mice receiving untreated
or scramble-treated tTregs, these differences were not statistically
significant.
Peripheral expansion of human T cells on days 14 to 20 correlates
inversely with survival.55 To quantitate the ability of each Treg cohort
to minimize expansion, HLA-A2 mismatching was used to distinguish
GVHD-causing PBMCs (HLA-A21) from tTregs (HLA-A22). Mice
were bled on day 14, and the total number of PBMC-derived cells per
microliter of blood was enumerated (Figure 7D). To assess T-cell
expansion, the number of CD41HLA-A21 and CD81HLA-A21 cells
per microliter of blood was quantitated (Figure 7E-F). All mice
receiving tTregs had reduced PBMC-derived CD4 T-cell numbers, and
mice receiving antagomir-treated tTregs had significantly fewer CD4
T cells than mice receiving untreated or scramble-treated tTregs.
Previous studies found that tTreg persistence correlates with
efficacy.55 We tested whether the enhanced survival of antagomir-
treated tTregs seen invitro might affect theirpersistence in vivo on days
7, 10, and 14. In both our xenogeneic GVHD model and in patients
receiving third-party–expanded tTreg, we have shown that tTregs are
difficult to detect in PB beyond days 10 to 12.7,55 Not surprisingly, the
cell number on day 10 was hard to detect, and the number of tTregs
observed on day 14 was not significantly higher than PBMC-only
controls (which should have no HLA-A21 cells) (data not shown).
However, mice injected with miR-146b antagomir-treated tTregs
had higher absolute numbers of circulating CD41HLA-A22 cells
on day 7 (Figure 7G) that mice in the scrambled or untreated
groups (7.8 6 3.2 cells/mL vs 4.6 6 3.2 cells/mL vs 4.4 6 3.5, P , .05
for miR-146b antagomir vs either group). Importantly, as observed in
vitro(supplementalFigure1B-D),antagomir-treatedtTregsmaintained
alevelofFoxp3 expressionequivalenttountreatedor scramble-treated
tTregs (Figure 7H). Although increased PB tTreg number on day 7 is
consistent with enhanced survival, other explanations include differ-
ences in expansion or homing.
Thus, knockdown of miR-146b-5p in tTregs increases in vivo
efficacy and can be exploited to improve the efficacy of adoptive Treg
therapy for the prevention of human GVHD.
Discussion
Our study suggests a new target to increase tTreg efficiency based
on miRNA level. These observations include the following: (1) Both
miR-146a and miR-146b-5p are highly differentially expressed in
tTregs compared with control T-cells, but our results suggested that,
in contrast to miR-146a, miR-146-5p negatively regulates FoxP3
expression, expansion. and tTreg function in vitro. (2) TRAF6, which
plays an essential role in tTreg expansion and function, is a direct target
of miRNA-146b-5p in human tTregs. (3) The NF-kB pathway is vital
for FoxP3 maintenance, and miR-146b-5p antagomir–treated tTregs
show enhanced nuclear localization of NF-kB. (4) Knockdown of
miRNA-146b-5p prolongs tTreg survivalby regulating NF-kB–related
apoptosis/antiapoptosis genes.(5) Antagomir treatment enhances tTreg
efficacy and persistence in a xenogeneic model of GVHD. While
Bhairavabhotla et al did not find miR-146b antagomir affected Foxp3
expression or suppressive function, tTregs were stimulated with a
suboptimal stimulus (plate-bound anti-CD3/28 vs artificial antigen-
presenting cell) and antagomir treated at earlier time points in their
studies (ie, days 1 and 3). In addition, Bhairavabhotla et al treated Tregs
with PNA, which simultaneously reduced both miR-146a and miR-
146bexpressionby.90%.AlthoughsomereportsfoundmiR-146a-5p

 positively regulates tTreg function in mice,25 we show that miR-146b-
5p (alone) has a negative role controlling tTreg function. Therefore, it is
possiblethatconcurrentdownmodulationofmiR-146aand146bhasno
net effect on Treg function. Based on these findings, we conclude that
miR-146b-5p might be a therapeutic target for Treg clinical trials.
Although miR-146a and miR-146b-5p have similar overall se-
quences and share the same “seed regions,” they have different precur-
sor miRNAs and distinct expression patterns and effects on target
mRNAs.56-58 Previous studies have shown that inhibition of miR-
146b-5p, but not miR-146a, significantly increased TRAF6 expression
in human umbilical vein endothelial cells23 while inhibitors of miR-
146a, but not miR-146b-5p, increased cyclooxygenase-2 protein
abundance.59 Because miRNAs have many potential targets, we also
cannot exclude the possibility that miR-146b binds to RNAs in Tregs
thatlimitsuppressive function,whereas in non-Tregs,miR-146b might
have a different function by binding RNA partners that influence cellular
functions other than suppression mechanisms. We have found that
knockdown of miR-146b-5p favors FoxP3 expression and suppressive
function in human tTregs, which indicates that miR-146b-5p and miR-
146a play opposite roles. While miR-146a positively controls Foxp3
expression, overexpressed miR-146b-5p is linked to the pathogenesis of
atherosclerosis with increased IL-171CD41 T-cell populations, suggest-
ing that miR-146b-5p is more proinflammatory, leading to diminished
Treg function.25,40,60 Combined with these studies, we think that the
diametricallyopposedfunctionsofthesemiR-146familymembersmight
beduetotheneedtomaintaintheproperTreg/Th17balanceinthehuman
immune system to prevent autoimmune complications.
TRAF6 helps maintain FoxP3 expression and stability in Tregs.
Although TRAF6 is a target of both miR-146a and miR-146b-5p in
manycelltypessuchasdendriticcellsandcancercells,19,43knockdown
of miR-146a increased tTreg TRAF6 expression in mice, but not
human, tTregs31 and increased TRAF6 in murine tTregs were not
responsible for enhanced tTreg function.25 We observed that miR-
146b-5p directly targeted TRAF6 39-UTR sites in human Tregs and
that knockdown of miR-146b-5p enhanced FoxP3 expression and
Treg function in vitro and in vivo. The importance of TRAF6 for tTreg
expansion and function was confirmed using a TRAF6-specific inhi-
bitor, which decreased Foxp3 expression, expansion, and suppressive
function. In support of distinct roles for miR-146b-5p and miR-146a,
knockdown of miR-146a did not alter TRAF6 expression in human
tTregs. Thus, the miR-146b-5p–TRAF6 pathway, but not miR-146a
pathways, control human tTreg function, expansion, and survival.
TheNF-kBfamilyoftranscriptionfactorsisregulatedbyafamilyof
inhibitors (IkB) that prevent nuclear translocation and by ubiquitin
ligases that induce IkB degradation, resulting in NF-kB activation.61
Consistent with TRAF6 activation, miR-146b knockdown increased
NF-kB nuclear localization in human tTregs, along with a concomitant
increase in Foxp3 expression. NF-kB has also been shown to regulate
several genes that are indispensable for tTreg survival, including
antiapoptotic members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and Mcl-1) and proapoptotic
members (BID and BAX).62-65 Our experiments found that the en-
hanced in vitro and in vivo survival of miR-146b antagomir–treated
tTregs correlated with increased expression of antiapoptosis genes
(Bcl-xL and Mcl-1) and decreased expression of apoptosis genes (BID
and BAX). Together, these results demonstrate that the miR-146b-
5p–TRAF6–NF-kB pathway plays a critical role in regulating tTreg
expansion, stability, and survival in vitro and in vivo (supplemental
Figure 5).
miRNA-regulated pathways involve Treg function and survival.
So far, 4 important pathways have been implicated: (1) miR-146a
positively regulates Treg function through STAT125; (2) miR-99/150
could favor Treg differentiation by repressing the expression of the
Th17-promoting factor mTOR39; (3) transferring miR-142-3p into
Tregs impairs suppressive function by targeting AC9 mRNA33,35; and
(4) although miR-155 doesn’t have an impact on FoxP3 expression in
Treg, it does positively control Treg number in vivo, and inhibition of
miR-155 sensitizes CD41 Th cells to Treg-related suppression.66-69
Thus, up- or downregulation of specific miRNAs in Tregs could be a
newtherapymethodusedtotreatGVHDpatientsinclinicaltrials.Here,
weconfirmanotherpathwaymiR-146b-5p–TRAF6–NF-kBcouldalso
contribute to this area.
tTreg adoptive cellular therapy has been shown to ameliorate
autoimmune disease, graft rejection, and GVHD. Translating adoptive
tTreg therapy to humans has proceeded slowly becauseof challenges in
maintaining a high expression of Foxp3 in cultured cells, overall yield,
and in vivo persistence of tTregs in GVHD patients.70,71 In this study,
we have shown that nanoparticle-mediated delivery of miR-146b-5p
antagomir to in vitro–expanded tTregs is an easy and efficient way
of overcoming these challenges, which may be useful in clinical
applications.
In summary, we demonstrate that a miR-146b-5p–TRAF6–NF-kB
pathway plays an vital rolein tTreg expansion, survival,and function in
vivo and vitro. Focusing on miRNA might become a new starting point
in Treg clinical trials.
