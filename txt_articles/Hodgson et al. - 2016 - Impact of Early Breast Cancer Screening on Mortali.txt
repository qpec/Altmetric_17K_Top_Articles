Abstract
Background: Female survivors treated with thoracic radiation therapy (RT) for childhood cancer experience increased risks 
of breast cancer (BC). There are currently no data quantifying the potential mortality gains of early BC screening among 
such survivors.
Methods: A mathematical model of BC development was used to evaluate the marginal benefit of early-initiated screening 
of  female survivors of adolescent Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) starting at age 25 years on BC mortality compared with 
screening initiated at age 40 years. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the estimates over a 
plausible range of conditions.
Results: For survivors treated at age 15 years, the absolute risk of BC mortality by age 75 years was predicted to decrease 
from 16.65% with no early screening to 16.28% (annual mammography), 15.40% (annual MRI), 15.38% (same-day annual 
mammography and MRI), and 15.37% (alternating mammography and MRI every six months). Approximately 80 patients 
would need to be invited to MRI-based screening to prevent one BC death. In sensitivity analyses, the number needed to 
invite to MRI-based screening to prevent one BC death ranged from 71 to 333. Combinations of MRI plus mammography 
were predicted to produce 99.52 false positives per 1000 screenings done between age 25 to 39 years.
Conclusions: These findings are the first to indicate that early MRI-based screening should reduce BC mortality among 
women treated with RT for adolescent HL. The magnitude of this benefit is superior to that described for other accepted 
screening indications although MRI can produce a substantial rate of false-positive results.
Survivors of childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk 
for delayed morbidity related to their treatment, and increas-
ing effort is being directed towards preventing or ameliorating 
late-treatment toxicity. One potentially modifiable late effect is 
mortality because of breast cancer (BC) among women treated 
with thoracic radiation therapy (RT). In particular, adolescent 
females treated with thoracic RT for Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) 
have been shown to have statistically significantly elevated risks 
of BC (1–3), and consensus guidelines recommend the early ini-
tiation of BC screening among these survivors (4).
Lack of supporting evidence is a major limitation of these 
guidelines, however. A recent update of UK guidelines for the 
follow-up of pediatric cancer survivors, for example, could not 
identify a single study examining the benefits or harms of specific 
screening programs, including the early initiation of BC screen-
ing in high-risk survivors (5). This lack of evidence may in part 
account for the observation that 55% to 85% of eligible survivors in 
the United States and Canada do not undergo BC screening (6,7).
While the effectiveness of early BC screening should ide-
ally be evaluated in a randomized trial, no such trial will be

undertaken in the foreseeable future. To address this clinical 
uncertainty, we conducted mathematical simulations under a 
range of clinically plausible conditions to quantify the potential 
benefit of early BC screening using different screening modali-
ties among women treated with mediastinal RT for Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma in adolescence.
Methods
Description of the Model
We modeled the health outcomes of a simulated cohort of 100 
000 female patients treated at age 15 years with mediastinal RT 
for HL and followed from age 25 to 75 years under different BC 
screening protocols. We evaluated the benefit of the early initia-
tion of high-risk screening beginning at age 25 years, consistent 
with Children’s Oncology Group guidelines (4), compared with 
average-risk screening initiated at age 40 years (8). Screening 
was continued until age 74 years in all scenarios. We assumed 
that all women did not have clinically detectable BC when they 
started screening at age 25 years. A schematic of the simulation 
model is shown in Figure 1.
Breast Cancer Incidence and Natural History
The annual incidence of BC among survivors was derived from 
epidemiologic studies of female HL survivors treated with medi-
astinal RT (1–3,9–13). Relative risks (declining in a piecewise 
linear fashion from 60 at age 25 years to 7.5 at age 40 years to 
2.0 at age 65 years) were used as multipliers to the age-specific 
BC incidence rates for the general US female population age 25 
to 75 years to derive cumulative incidence rates, adjusted to 
account for competing risks of death (10–12,14–16). The model 
was calibrated to produce a cumulative incidence of BC compat-
ible with that described in cohort studies of adolescent females 
treated with mediastinal RT (10–12). From these incidence mod-
els, we estimated the number of survivors in our simulated 
cohort who would be expected to develop BC and the age of their 
BC occurrence.
The growth of breast tumors was simulated using a continu-
ous time, parametric, stochastic model described previously 
(17,18). We programmed the model in R following the detailed 
specifications given in Plevritis et al. (18) and include additional 
details in the Supplementary Methods (available online). The 
model generates an individual growth rate and simulates the 
time course, stage, and volume for the growth of a tumor start-
ing from a diameter of 2 
mm to eventual detection, with possible 
transitions to regional and metastatic stages. Based on available 
evidence, the baseline model assumed that breast tumors arise 
earlier in life in HL survivors than in the general population but 
with a similar growth rate once occurring. These assumptions 
were tested as described below. The generated age at clinical 
detection was aligned with the BC incidence from the epide-
miologic incidence model. This yields a cohort in which some 
women develop BC with an age-specific incidence and stage 
distribution that is controlled by the underlying natural history 
model, and consistent with available data.
Screening and Detection
Once an individual patient’s BC natural history was simulated, 
various screening protocols starting at age 25 years were over-
laid to predict when and how the tumor would be detected. 
The sensitivity and specificity of mammography and MRI were 
derived from studies of average- and high-risk populations 
(Table 1; Supplementary Methods, available online) (19–25). 
When an enlarging tumor exceeded specific size thresholds, it 
became screen-detectable. Based on work described previously, 
5 
mm tumors were considered potentially MRI detectable and 
mammographically visible tumors had a median detection size 
of 10 
mm (17,18).
We evaluated the following screening scenarios: 1) average-risk 
screening: annual mammography from age 40 to 74 years; 2) early 
mammography: annual mammography from age 25 to 74 years;

3) early MRI: annual MRI from age 25 to 39 years, then annual 
mammography + MRI from age 40 to 74 years; 4) early same-day 
mammography + MRI: annual mammography + MRI performed 
at same time from age 25 to 74 years; 5) early alternating mam-
mography + MRI: annual mammography + annual MRI alternating 
q6 monthly from age 25 to 74 years. The baseline schedule of aver-
age-risk screening reflects recommendations from the American 
Cancer Society (8) that were selected because they recommend 
starting earlier and imaging more frequently than other analagous 
recommendations, which seemed appropriate given the nature of 
the cohort. Compliance rates were based on published reports of 
compliance in clinical trials of BC screening (22,23,26–30), with 65% 
of women fully compliant, 25% partly compliant (attending half of 
their annual screenings), and 10% noncompliant.
A tumor was designated as “screen-detected” when the 
survivor attended screening, her tumor was larger than the 
mammographic or MRI detection threshold, and the screening test 
returned a positive result. Alternatively, a tumor was designated as 
“clinically detected” at the simulated age of BC incidence, provided 
no previous positive screening tests had occurred. There was a 
small increase in MRI specificity and a decrease in sensitivity after 
the first two screening rounds, but otherwise we assumed that the 
results of repeated screens on the same woman were independent.
Mortality Component
For the modeled cohort, two survival times were calculated, one 
for BC-related deaths and one for all other causes of death. Age- 
and stage-matched BC survival rates for patients with BC in the 
general population were obtained from SEER (31). In the baseline 
scenario, HL survivors were modeled to have 50% higher stage- 
and age-specific BC mortality rates than the general population

based on published studies (32,33). Using these sources, survival 
times from BC diagnosis were calculated for all subjects devel-
oping BC in the simulations. Given that SEER provides survival 
times in five-year increments, we assumed a uniform distribu-
tion of survival within each five-year interval following diag-
nosis. Breast cancer survival was only determined for subjects 
labeled in the model iteration as developing BC.
To account for competing risks of non-BC death, we extracted 
annual relative survival data from SEER for women with a pri-
mary HL diagnosis before age 18 years who were diagnosed 
between 1973 and 2008, were known to have survived to age 
25 years, and did not die of BC. The annual relative survival rates 
for age 25 to 40 years ranged from between 98.56% and 100.07% 
(median = 99.59%). Because of sparse data after age 40 years, 
we assumed a relative survival of 98.50%. Annual survival rates 
were then calculated by comparison with standard 2008 age-
specific US mortality rates obtained from the National Center 
for Health Statistics (34). The final simulated age at death was 
the lesser of age at death because of BC (for those developing 
BC) and age at death because of any non-BC cause. Mortality 
was considered up to age 75 years, at which point the simulation 
model stopped. Breast cancer mortality and mortality from all 
other causes were treated as competing risks for death.
Outcome Measures
The screening protocols were assessed by estimating the 
cumulative mortality because of BC up to age 75 years in the 
entire cohort invited to screening and among those diagnosed 
with BC from age 25 to 39 years. We also examined the num-
ber of BC deaths prevented per 1000 screened (or invited) from 
age 25 to 39 years compared with average-risk mammographic 
screening starting at age 40, years and the number needed to 
screen with an early-onset screening protocol to prevent one 
BC death. BC deaths prevented was calculated by comparing 
the number of BC deaths occurring among the same cohort of 
women simulated to undergo either one of the early screen-
ing scenarios or average-risk screening. For each early-onset 
screening scenario, we determined the number of BC deaths 
occurring in the subcohort of women screened at least once 
from age 25 to 40 years and compared this with the number 
of BC deaths occurring had the same women simulated under 
the average-risk screening scenario. Note that the set natu-
ral histories of disease in the cohorts are the same; only the 
screening scenarios differ. The difference between these two 
numbers was the number of BC deaths prevented through 
early screening. Dividing this by the subcohort size and mul-
tiplying by 1000 gives the number of BC deaths prevented per 
1000 screened. The number needed to invite is a comparable 
comparison but compares BC deaths among all “invited” sub-
jects, including those who are modelled as completely non-
compliant with screening.
We also report the lead time (years between a screen diag-
nosis and the potential clinical diagnosis) and the false posi-
tives per 1000 screens and per woman screened. The latter is 
the proportion of screens in breast cancer–free women age 25 
to 39 years who are incorrectly positive, reported as the average 
number of false positives an ever-screened woman experiences 
over the course of the screening protocol from age 25 to 74 years. 
Finally, we report the proportion of overdiagnosed cases. A BC 
casewas defined as overdiagnosed if screen-detected before age 
40 years in a women who, in the absence of screening, would 
have died from non-BC related causes before her BC would have 
been clinically detected.
For the primary analyses, median estimates and bootstrap 
95% confidence intervals were based on 250 Monte Carlo repli-
cates of 100 000 individuals. Estimates for the sensitivity anal-
yses were based on 50 replicates. All statistical analyses were 
performed with R 2.14.2 (http://cran.r-project.org).
Sensitivity Analyses
One-way sensitivity analyses were run to evaluate the stability 
of our results to variations in the model inputs. Factors that were 
varied included tumor growth rate, BC incidence, BC mortality, 
all-cause mortality in HL survivors, the sensitivity and specific-
ity of the screening tests, and compliance rates (Supplementary 
Table 1, available online). The goal of the one-way sensitivity 
analysis was to evaluate the effect of changing model inputs to 
what were deemed to be extreme levels. Additional best- and 
worst-case scenarios were run, in which all input variables were 
set to maximize or minimize the effect of screening or to exam-
ine the most extreme results produced by the model. This gives 
upper and lower bounds on what one might expect the effects of 
screening to be over a wide range of clinically plausible settings.
Results
Model Performance Compared With Published 
Epidemiologic and Clinical Data
The model-estimated cumulative incidence of BC among survi-
vors at ages 40, 45, 50, and 60 years were 13.51%, 20.74%, 27.29%, 
and 36.66% respectively, which are consistent with observed out-
comes in observational studies (Supplementary Methods, avail-
able online) (1,11,26,27) With the assumption of 90% compliance 
with mammographic screening alone, 64.14% of BCs were iden-
tified with mammography, with 75.87% node-negative, 22.67% 
node-positive, and 1.46% metastatic disease, respectively. The 
overall five-year survival after a BC diagnosis between age 25 
and 39 years was 73.64%. These estimates are consistent with 
clinical reports of female HL survivors with good compliance to 
early mammographic screening protocols (23,28).
Early Mammographic Screening
Early 
annual 
mammographic 
screening 
with 
moderate 
(65/25/10) compliance increased the proportion of cases diag-
nosed at localized stages prior to age 40 years (Table 2). In the 
whole cohort screened to age 75 years, the early initiation of 
annual mammographic screening was estimated to reduce the 
absolute risk of BC death from 16.65% to 16.28% by age 75 years 
compared with average-risk screening starting at age 40 years 
(Table 3 and Figure 2A). With moderate compliance, just over 
259 women would have to be invited to early mammographic 
screening to prevent one BC death over the full course of the 
screening program, or, alternatively, 3.86 BC deaths would be 
prevented per 1000 women invited and moderately compliant 
with a mammographic screening program (Table 3).
Early MRI Screening
Moderate compliance with MRI screening alone further reduced 
the proportion of node-positive and metastatic disease, and 
increased the proportion of early-stage cancers diagnosed before 
age 40 years to 86.88%. Among all subjects, early MRI screening 
alone was predicted to reduce BC mortality by age 75 years to

15.40%. With moderate compliance, approximately 80 women 
would require invitation to early MRI screening to prevent one 
BC death by age 75 years compared with average-risk mammo-
graphic screening (ie, 12.48 BC deaths would be prevented per 
1000 women invited for early screening).
Combinations of MRI and Mammography
Among all subjects, same-day MRI plus mammography reduced 
the absolute risk of death from BC mortality by age 75 years 
to 15.38%, and with moderate compliance approximately 79 
women would require invitation to combined screening to pre-
vent one BC death (Table 3). Compared with MRI alone, the ben-
efit of early-initiated mammography required 7692 women to be 
invited to screening with both modalities over the full course of 
the screening program to prevent one additional BC death.
Alternating MRI and mammography every six months pro-
duced a negligible reduction in BC mortality compared with 
same-day imaging (15.37% vs 15.38% by age 75 years) and a 
slightly smaller number needed to invite (~78) to save one life 
(Table 3). Compared with MRI screening alone, an additional 
2532 patients would need to be invited to additional alternating 
mammography to prevent one additional BC death.
False Positives and Overdiagnosis
MRI was predicted to substantially increase the proportion of 
false-positives to 71.71 per 1000 screens, as compared with 
mammography alone, which was predicted to produce 30 false 
positives per 1000 screens. Combinations of MRI plus mammog-
raphy were predicted to produce 99.52 false positives per 1000 
screens done between age 25 and 39 years (Table 2). Extended 
over the course of the screening program to age 75 years, at 
least one false positive result would be expected to occur in 
48% of women when screened with mammography, 74% when 
screened with MRI alone, and 79% when screened with both 
modalities.
The proportion of overdiagnosed BC cases during age 25 to 
39 years following screening with mammography, MRI, or both 
modalities was predicted to be 1.76%, 3.58%, and 3.57%, respec-
tively (Table 2).
Sensitivity Analyses
Most young women treated for HL who are currently emerging 
into an age of screening eligibility will have received treatment 
that more effectively cures HL with lower normal tissue radiation 
doses and potentially lower risks of BC and other delayed causes 
of mortality than the treatments that are the epidemiologic basis 
for quantifying second cancer risk (2). Based on dosimetry and 
clinical outcome studies of patients treated with more modern 
RT techniques in the context of combined-modality therapy, 
we evaluated the effect of screening with the relative risk of 
BC reduced by 65% and the risk of non-BC mortality is reduced 
by 10% (2). The absolute BC mortality by age 75 associated with 
mammography alone, MRI alone, or both simultaneously was 
5.87%, 5.57%, and 5.56%, respectively, compared with 6.00% with 
no early screening (Table 4 and Figure 2B). The relative reductions 
in BC mortality for these screening interventions vs no early 
screening were 2.17%, 7.17%, and 7.33 %, respectively (Table 4 and 
Figure 2B). The numbers needed to invite to early screening to 
prevent one BC death were 769, 231, and 231, respectively.
In one-way sensitivity analyses, the greatest loss of effective-
ness was seen in the scenario of a 75% reduction in BC risk, in

which case approximately 333 patients would have to be invited 
to MRI screening or 1150 to mammographic screening in order 
to prevent one BC death. In a scenario in which all input vari-
ables were set to maximize the incidence of BC mortality, 94.07 
to 96.95 patients would have to be invited to early MRI-based 
screening to prevent one BC death, whereas when BC mortal-
ity was minimized these values were 833.33 to 840.34 invita-
tions per BC death prevented (Supplementary Table 1, available 
online).
Discussion
One of the most appealing methods of reducing the morbidity of 
late-onset treatment toxicity is to detect asymptomatic disease 
before it causes clinical problems. Consequently, expert con-
sensus guidelines recommend early screening for BC, colorectal 
cancer, and heart disease among selected asymptomatic survi-
vors based on treatment exposures (4,5,35). However, a major 
limitation of these recommendations is the lack of data to indi-
cate the extent to which early screening will improve the health 
outcomes among survivors.
This study provides the first quantitative evidence that 
the early initiation of BC screening will reduce BC mortality 
among female survivors of adolescent HL treated with medias-
tinal RT. T
wo hundred and sixty high-risk survivors treated at 
age 15 years would have to be invited to start mammographic 
screening at age 25 years, or 80 invited to MRI screening, to pre-
vent one BC death. In sensitivity analyses spanning a range of 
plausible clinical circumstances, early screening was consist-
ently predicted to reduce absolute BC mortality, with the major 
limitation of MRI-based screening being the high risk of false 
positives over the course of a screening program.

The absolute reduction in BC deaths expected with early 
screening compares favorably with that described for well-
established screening indications. For example, analyses of 
several BC screening trials suggest that that approximately 350 
to 400 women would need 10 or more years of annual mam-
mographic screening starting at age 50 years to prevent one 
BC death (36,37), and other studies have estimated that 1339 
women age 50 to 59 years would need to be invited to a screen-
ing program to prevent one BC death (37). Duffy et al. estimated 
that the UK Breast Screening Program prevented 5.7 BC deaths 
prevented per 1000 women screened for 20 years starting at 
age 50 years (38), while our work suggests that 13.92 to 14.35 
BC deaths are prevented with early MRI-based screening among 
young HL survivors screened over a 24-year period.
Our results support the use of MRI screening in HL survi-
vors treated in adolescence, a finding consistent with studies 
of other high-risk populations (36). However, the use of MRI was 
predicted to increase the proportion of women experiencing a 
false-positive test and 79% of women were predicted to experi-
ence at least one false positive over the course of the screen-
ing program when both modalities were used, and this could 
increase the anxiety associated with screening (39). In addition, 
approximately 3.6% of detected cancers were overdiagnosed, 
affecting less than 1% of screened patients. This rate is substan-
tially lower than that estimated for average-risk screen-eligible 
patients (typically ~ 20%) (40), but slightly higher than the over-
diagnosis rate estimated for BRCA2 carriers undergoing MRI 
screening (2.2%) (17), likely because of the higher risk of non-BC 
mortality among middle-aged HL survivors.
The incremental reduction in BC mortality because of 
mammography when added to MRI screening has not been 
evaluated for high-risk survivors. Our findings indicate that 
the absolute gain compared with MRI alone is likely to be very 
small, with a large number of patients requiring additional 
screening to save one additional life. However, the model 
employed did not include DCIS as part of the natural history 
because little is known about its progression, particularly in 
the setting of prior RT. Including a DCIS phase would require 
additional assumptions regarding the proportion of cases that 
progress to invasive disease and the rate at which this pro-
gression occurs. The model used here assumes that DCIS does 
not contribute to BC mortality and its detection and treatment 
would not substantially reduce BC mortality among screened 
patients. In our view, the most important limitation of this 
assumption arises from the observation that mammography 
can detect calcifications associated with DCIS that may be 
missed by MRI. Consequently, mammographic detection of 
DCIS may be beneficial by allowing premalignant lesions to be 
treated without systemic therapy, and this benefit would not 
be revealed in this study. Our view is that these issues should 
be discussed with patients when developing an individual 
screening strategy.
Among HL survivors undergoing mammographic screening, 
a substantial proportion of BCs are detected clinically in the 
interval between annual imaging (41,42). Our results estimated 
that 41.7% of survivors developing BC after being invited to 
undergo mammography would have their tumor detected clini-
cally, compared with 20.8% of patients invited to undergo MRI 
screening. The high rate of clinical detection raises the possibil-
ity that alternating MRI with mammography every six months 
may be preferable, and while this screening protocol yielded 
the lowest BC mortality rate, the additional gain over MRI alone 
was small. Although the value of breast self-examination is con-
troversial, our view is that patients should be made aware that 
even with screening some BCs will be detected clinically so that 
they do not ignore signs of malignancy.
The study has limitations that warrant consideration. 
Among the potential sources for inaccuracy is the challenge of 
matching the expected incidence of BC in HL survivors based 
on cohort studies in which the means of detection were not 
provided in detail (1,10–12). Given that early studies demon-
strating increased BC risk preceded recommendations for early 
screening and the low rate of early screening even after the 
elevated risk was recognized in the medical community (6), we 
think it is unlikely that a meaningful proportion of survivors in 
early cohort studies participated in early screening programs. 
However, if this assumption is incorrect and a large majority of 
patients in these studies had their cancers detected on screen-
ing, then our model would overestimate the incidence of BC and 
inflate the potential benefit of screening. Given the results of our 
sensitivity analysis, however, we view this as unlikely to have a 
major impact on the long-term outcomes described.
Another limitation is the absence of cost considerations. 
Understanding cost-effectiveness is an important consideration 
when making treatment recommendations for patient popula-
tions. Future work should evaluate the occurrence and progres-
sion of DCIS and develop robust cost-effectiveness models for 
young survivors.
In addition, the work is based on an HL treatment age of 
15 years, chosen based on the median age of pediatric HL stud-
ies. Existing data on second cancer risk as it relates to treatment 
age are not sufficiently granular to allow the model to be more 
finely calibrated to distinguish risk differences between differ-
ent adolescent ages. Furthermore, additional work is required 
to explore in detail the optimal timing of starting and ending 
screening because guidelines differ in their recommendations 
in this regard.
In conclusion, early BC screening is predicted to reduce the 
risk of BC death among young female HL survivors, and the num-
ber needed to screen to prevent one BC death compares favora-
bly with accepted breast screening indications. MRI screening 
is more effective in reducing BC mortality than mammography 
in these patients but increases the rate of false-positive results.
