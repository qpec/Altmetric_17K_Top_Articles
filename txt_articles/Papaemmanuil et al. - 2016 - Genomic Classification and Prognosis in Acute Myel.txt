Abstract
Background—Recent studies have provided a detailed census of genes that are mutated in acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML). Our next challenge is to understand how this genetic diversity defines 
the pathophysiology of AML and informs clinical practice.
Methods—We enrolled a total of 1540 patients in three prospective trials of intensive therapy. 
Combining driver mutations in 111 cancer genes with cytogenetic and clinical data, we defined 
AML genomic subgroups and their relevance to clinical outcomes.
Results—We identified 5234 driver mutations across 76 genes or genomic regions, with 2 or 
more drivers identified in 86% of the patients. Patterns of co-mutation compartmentalized the

 cohort into 11 classes, each with distinct diagnostic features and clinical outcomes. In addition to 
currently defined AML subgroups, three heterogeneous genomic categories emerged: AML with 
mutations in genes encoding chromatin, RNA-splicing regulators, or both (in 18% of patients); 
AML with TP53 mutations, chromosomal aneuploidies, or both (in 13%); and, provisionally, 
AML with IDH2R172 mutations (in 1%). Patients with chromatin–spliceosome and TP53–
aneuploidy AML had poor outcomes, with the various class-defining mutations contributing 
independently and additively to the outcome. In addition to class-defining lesions, other co-
occurring driver mutations also had a substantial effect on overall survival. The prognostic effects 
of individual mutations were often significantly altered by the presence or absence of other driver 
mutations. Such gene–gene interactions were especially pronounced for NPM1-mutated AML, in 
which patterns of co-mutation identified groups with a favorable or adverse prognosis. These 
predictions require validation in prospective clinical trials.
Conclusions—The driver landscape in AML reveals distinct molecular subgroups that reflect 
discrete paths in the evolution of AML, informing disease classification and prognostic 
stratification. (Funded by the Wellcome Trust and others; ClinicalTrials.gov number, 
NCT00146120.)
Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) is characterized by clonal expansion of undifferentiated 
myeloid precursors, resulting in impaired hematopoiesis and bone marrow failure. Although 
many patients with AML have a response to induction chemotherapy, refractory disease is 
common, and relapse represents the major cause of treatment failure.1
Cancer develops from somatically acquired driver mutations, which account for the myriad 
biologic and clinical complexities of the disease. A classification of cancers that is based on 
causality is likely to be durable, reproducible, and clinically relevant. This is already evident 
in the case of AML, for which there has been a progressive shift from a morphologic 
classification scheme to one informed by causative genomic changes.2–4 Systematic studies 
of the genomic landscape of AML, such as analyses of data from the Cancer Genome Atlas5 
(TCGA), have generated a catalogue of leukemia genes that is increasingly comprehensive. 
It is therefore an opportune time to revisit the possibility of an AML classification scheme 
that is fully genomic.
With whole-genome sequencing, AML emerges as a complex, dynamic disease.5–8 There 
are many leukemia genes, most of which are infrequently mutated, and patients typically 
have more than one driver mutation.5 The disease evolves over time, with multiple 
competing clones coexisting at any time.5–8 These discoveries are revealing the biologic 
intricacies of AML, but how they inform clinical practice is unclear.
Here we report a comprehensive study of leukemia genes in three clinical trials of intensive 
AML treatment, acknowledging that the landscape of AML in older patients may be 
underrepresented. The structure of driver mutations identifies nonoverlapping subgroups of 
patients, allowing a fully genomic classification of AML. Beyond class, we explore patterns 
of gene–gene co-occurrences and investigate how such compound genotypes are related to 
clinical outcomes.

 Methods
Study Participants, Treatment, and Oversight
We obtained samples from patients participating in three prospective multicenter clinical 
trials of the German–Austrian AML Study Group: AML-HD98A, AML-HD98B, and 
AMLSG-07-04 (see the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this article 
at NEJM.org).9–11 In AML-HD98A, patients 18 to 65 years of age received induction 
chemotherapy consisting of idarubicin, cytarabine, and etoposide (ICE); high-risk patients 
were offered allogeneic stem-cell transplantation, intermediate-risk patients a stem-cell 
allograft (if a matched related donor was available) or intensive chemotherapy, and low-risk 
patients intensive chemotherapy. AMLSG-07-04 had a similar design, but patients 18 to 61 
years of age were randomly assigned to receive ICE or ICE plus all-trans retinoic acid 
(ATRA) as induction therapy. In AML-HD98B, patients 58 to 84 years of age were 
randomly assigned to induction therapy with ICE or ICE plus ATRA, with further therapy 
dictated by the response (see Figs. S1 and S2 in the Supplementary Appendix). The median 
follow-up period was 5.9 years (Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). All patients 
provided written informed consent.
The last two authors guided the analysis and data interpretation.
Genetic Studies
Genetic profiling included cytogenetic analyses and sequencing of 111 genes (Table S2 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). Sequencing data have been deposited in the European 
Genome-Phenome Archive (www.ebi.ac.uk/ega) under accession number 
EGAS00001000275. We based our analysis on variants that we classified as driver 
mutations, using widely accepted genetic criteria.12 Recurrent fusion genes, aneuploidies, 
and leukemia gene mutations, including base substitutions and small (<200-bp) insertions or 
deletions (indels), were all included as drivers.
Statistical Analysis
We used Bayesian Dirichlet processes13 to establish classification rules that partitioned 
patients into subgroups, minimizing overlap between categories. The Dirichlet process 
defines an infinite prior distribution for the number and proportions of clusters in a mixture 
model, fitted with the use of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method.
We modeled overall survival using Cox proportional-hazards methods with the study 
variables treated as random effects14 (see the Methods section in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Random effects are modeled as independently distributed normal variables with 
identical mean and variance across eight variable categories: point mutations (58 variables), 
fusion genes (8), copy-number alterations (18), clinical variables (11), demographic 
characteristics (2), treatment (3), nuisance (4; nuisance variables are other or missing 
variables, such as the trial a patient was enrolled in, the year a patient entered the clinical 
trial, and whether cytogenetic data were missing), and gene–gene interaction terms, defined 
as nonadditive effects on survival between two genes when both are mutated (126). We used

 an expectation-maximization algorithm to estimate the shared means and variances; 
maximum a posteriori estimates were used for the effects of individual variables.
Results
Driver-Mutation Landscape of AML
We identified 5234 driver mutations involving 76 genes or regions in 1540 patients (Fig. 1A, 
and Tables S5 and S6 in the Supplementary Appendix), with mutation frequencies that were 
consistent with those in previous studies4,5 (Fig. S2c in the Supplementary Appendix). 
Point mutations accounted for 73% of all drivers (3824 of 5234) (Fig. S2d in the 
Supplementary Appendix) and were often enriched in patients with AML classified as 
intermediate risk according to current guidelines.3 We identified at least 1 driver mutation in 
1478 of 1540 samples (96%), and 2 or more driver mutations in 86% of samples (Fig. S2e in 
the Supplementary Appendix). The mutation landscape in this cohort, including novel 
hotspot mutations in MYC, is described in detail in the Results S1 section in the 
Supplementary Appendix.
Although patterns of co-mutation and mutual exclusivity have been described previously in 
AML,4,5 our sample size afforded a more comprehensive analysis, which identified many 
new pairwise gene–gene correlations (see the Results S2 section, Tables S7 and S8, and Fig. 
S3a in the Supplementary Appendix). We also found surprising differences in patterns of co-
mutation for hotspots within genes. NPM1, for example, preferentially associated with 
NRASG12/13 but not with NRASQ61. Distinct patterns of co-mutation were also observed for 
IDH2R140 and IDH2R172 and for FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3ITD) and FLT3 
tyrosine kinase domain (FLT3TKD) mutations (Fig. S3b). Thus, the functional consequences 
of hotspot mutations within genes may not be equivalent.
Leukemias often comprise heterogeneous mixtures of subclones,6–8,15 but samples to date 
have been too small to define common patterns of evolution. We used allele fractions of 
point mutations to infer clonal relationships5,7,16,17 (see the Results S3 section in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Mutations in DNMT3A, ASXL1, IDH1/2, and TET2, genes that 
encode epigenetic modifiers, were often acquired earliest (Fig. S4a in the Supplementary 
Appendix). These genes are frequently mutated in elderly persons with clonal hematopoiesis 
and confer an increased risk of hematologic cancers.18–22 In our study population with 
AML, mutations in these genes were typically in the founding clone and were almost never 
found in isolation, suggesting that they are not sufficient for overt leukemia (Fig. S4b in the 
Supplementary Appendix). Mutations in receptor tyrosine kinase–RAS pathway genes 
typically occurred late23–25 and frequently more than once in the same patient (Fig. S5 in 
the Supplementary Appendix). NPM1 mutations were usually secondary events, often 
occurring after DNMT3A, IDH1, or NRAS mutations (Fig. S6 and Table S9 in the 
Supplementary Appendix). These data suggest that development of AML follows specific 
and ordered evolutionary trajectories.

 Implications of Genomic Structure for Classification of AML
In the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, molecular groups in adult 
AML include t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(16)–t(16;16), t(6;9), inv(3)–t(3;3), MLL fusion genes, 
and provisionally, CEBPA or NPM1 mutations.26 In our cohort, AML in 736 patients (48%) 
would not be classified according to these genomic lesions, even though 96% of the patients 
had driver mutations. The characterization of many new leukemia genes, multiple driver 
mutations per patient, and complex co-mutation patterns prompted us to reevaluate genomic 
classification of AML from the beginning.
We developed a Bayesian statistical model to compartmentalize AML into mutually 
exclusive subtypes on the basis of patterns of co-mutation (see the Methods section and Fig. 
S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). From this model, we defined simple rules to generate 
11 subgroups or classes of AML (Table 1, Fig. 1B, and Fig. 2; and Results sections S4 
through S7 in the Supplementary Appendix). We found that inv(16), t(15;17), t(8;21), inv(3), 
t(6;9), and MLL fusions each represent small, individual subgroups (≤5% of the study 
cohort), confirming the WHO classification. NPM1-mutated AML and CEBPAbiallelic AML 
were also identified as distinct subgroups. NPM1-mutated AML was the largest class in our 
cohort (accounting for 27% of the cohort), with 73% of patients (319 of 436) also carrying 
mutations in DNA methylation or hydroxymethylation genes (DNMT3A, IDH1, IDH2R140, 
and TET2).
The second largest subgroup, accounting for 18% of the cohort, was defined by mutations in 
genes regulating RNA splicing (SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, and ZRSR2), chromatin (ASXL1, 
STAG2, BCOR, MLLPTD, EZH2, and PHF6), or transcription (RUNX1); we call this the 
chromatin–spliceosome group. In contrast to the WHO classes of AML, no single genomic 
lesion defines this group. In our cohort, it could not be further subdivided because of the 
overlapping patterns of co-mutations among the defining genes (Fig. 2).
Mutations in TP53, complex karyotype alterations, cytogenetically visible copy-number 
alterations (aneuploidies), or a combination, characterize an additional AML subgroup 
(accounting for 13% of the cohort). This group emerges because specific chromosomal 
abnormalities are closely correlated with one another and with TP53 mutations, but both are 
mutually exclusive with other class-defining lesions. Since this subtype includes patients 
with TP53 mutations, isolated chromosomal-arm losses or gains, or both, it is broader than 
previously proposed groups, such as “monosomal karyotype AML” and “complex karyotype 
AML”2,3,27,28 (see the Results S5 section in the Supplementary Appendix). Patients in this 
subgroup were older and had fewer RAS-pathway mutations than patients in other 
subgroups (Fig. 2, and Fig. S3a in the Supplementary Appendix). This may reflect 
redundancy between RAS-pathway activation by point mutation and loss of RAS regulators 
by chromosomal aneuploidies.29
Finally, our analysis identified a subgroup of AML with IDH2R172 mutations, accounting for 
1% of the cohort. Unlike IDH2R140 mutations, which show strong co-mutation with NPM1 
(odds ratio for co-mutation, 3.6; P= 5×10−10), IDH2R172 mutations are mutually exclusive 
with NPM1 (odds ratio for co-mutation, 0.06; P= 4×10−5) and other class-defining lesions. 
IDH2R172 AML is associated with gene-expression and DNA-methylation profiles that differ

 from the profiles for other IDH mutations and that lead to more severe aberrations in 
metabolic activity,30,31 adding further support for it as a distinct entity.
Under this schema, 1236 of the 1540 patients with driver mutations (80%) were 
unambiguously classified in a single subgroup, and 56 patients (4%) met criteria for two or 
more categories (Fig. 1B). These mostly fell in the TP53–aneuploidy and chromatin–
spliceosome classes. A total of 166 patients (11%) with driver mutations remained 
unclassified, potentially harboring mutations in drivers not sequenced here6 or class-
defining mutations that were missed. Notably, 105 of 166 unclassified patients had two or 
more driver mutations, with DNMT3A, TET2, IDH1, FLT3, and NRAS observed most 
frequently.
We applied the classification scheme developed here to the independent cohort that was 
evaluated for the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),5 which included many older patients with 
AML. The absence of overlap among subgroups was replicated, and the relative frequencies 
were equivalent to those in our cohort (see the Results S8 section in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Clinical Implications of Genomic Classification of AML
Although a genomic classification does not pre-suppose clinical relevance, its foundation on 
causal mutations could plausibly provide a bridge from molecular to clinical features of 
disease. We found considerable differences in clinical presentation and overall survival 
across the genomic subgroups (Fig. 3A, and Fig. S8 and the Results S5 section in the 
Supplementary Appendix). For subgroups defined by fusion genes, NPM1 and 
CEBPAbiallelic mutations, survival curves were as expected. Despite its more inclusive 
definition, the TP53–aneuploidy subgroup had dismal outcomes, as previously described.
3,26,28,32
As compared with other groups, patients in the chromatin–spliceosome group were older, 
with lower white-cell and blast counts, lower rates of response to induction chemotherapy, 
higher relapse rates, and a poor long-term clinical outlook (Fig. S9 in the Supplementary 
Appendix). Under current guidelines,3 84% of patients in this subgroup (232 of 275) would 
be classified as being at intermediate risk, whereas their outcomes are in fact similar to those 
for patients in subgroups of AML with adverse outcomes, such as patients with MLL fusion 
genes (except for MLLT3–MLL fusion) or t(6;9) (Fig. 3A). In this group, 9% of patients had 
antecedent chronic myeloid disorders,33 and 91% of the patients in this subgroup had a 
diagnosis of de novo AML (Fig. S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). Evaluation of the 
morphologic features in bone marrow specimens from 1064 patients in the cohort showed 
dysplastic features in 139 patients, 55 of whom were molecularly assigned to the chromatin–
spliceosome group (Fig. S11 in the Supplementary Appendix). The same chromatin and 
splicing factors are also frequently mutated in high-risk myeloproliferative neoplasms34 and 
myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS),17,35 suggesting that this subgroup could transcend 
conventional diagnostic boundaries36 between acute and high-risk chronic myeloid 
disorders.

 Although the number of patients in the IDH2R172 subgroup was small, the long-term 
outcomes in this group were broadly similar to those in patients with NPM1-mutated AML 
(Fig. 3A).37 Patients in whom no driver mutations were detected had lower blast and 
whitecell counts and better outcomes (Fig. 3A, and Fig. S12a in the Supplementary 
Appendix).
Influence of Co-occurring Mutations on Clinical Outcomes
Overall survival was correlated with the number of driver mutations (Fig. S12b in the 
Supplementary Appendix), independent of age and the whitecell count (P= 8×10−12). One 
possible explanation for this finding is that driver mutations other than class-defining lesions 
influence clinical outcomes. For example, despite the frequent cooccurrence of a TP53 
mutation and a complex karyotype, they were correlated independently and additively with 
survival in our cohort (Fig. 3B). Similarly, mutations in chromatin, splicing, and 
transcriptional regulators are frequently associated with low survival rates, and co-mutation 
among these genes typically results in even lower survival rates (Fig. 3C, and Fig. S13 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
We developed multivariate models to explore the relative contributions of genetic, clinical, 
and diagnostic variables to overall survival. Using the full model, we could correctly rank 
approximately 71% of patients for overall survival (vs. 64% with models using only 
variables in the European LeukemiaNet criteria) (Fig. 3D). Genomic features were the most 
powerful predictors, accounting for about two thirds of explained variation, with the other 
third contributed by demographic, clinical, and treatment variables (Fig. 3D). Among 
genomic factors, fusion genes, copy-number alterations, and point mutations were broadly 
equivalent. These overall findings were replicated in the TCGA cohort of patients with 
AML5 (see the Results S8 section and Fig. S14 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Although a number of genomic variants are significant predictors of overall survival 
(P≤0.01) (Table 2 and Fig. 3E), many more genes show a somewhat weaker correlation with 
outcome (Table S10 in the Supplementary Appendix). The prognostic effects of class-
defining lesions have mostly been described before, but we note the independent deleterious 
effects of TP53 mutations and the chromatin–spliceosome genes, such as SRSF2 and 
ASXL1. BRAF mutations are independently associated with a worse prognosis (P=0.009, 
q=0.06), and BRAF inhibitors might be a useful therapeutic option for patients in this 
subgroup.
Influence of Complex Gene Interactions on Survival
The prognostic effects of TP53 mutations and complex karyotype (Fig. 3B) and of ASXL1 
and SRSF2 mutations (Fig. 3C) are examples of additive associations — that is, the 
deleterious effect of each lesion remains unchanged whether or not another is present, with 
co-occurrence indicating a particularly dismal prognosis. We found that 11% of explained 
variation in survival in the cohort could be attributed to gene–gene interactions (Fig. 3D and 
Table 2), in which the prognostic effect of one gene is significantly altered if another gene is 
co-mutated. This suggests that the clinical effect of some driver mutations is modified by the 
wider genomic context in which they occur.

 In our data set, this was exemplified by a three-way interaction among NPM1, DNMT3A, 
and FLT3ITD. This combined genotype represented the most frequent three-gene co-
occurrence in our cohort, identified in 93 of the 1540 patients (6%) (P<0.0001). We found 
that the deleterious effect of FLT3ITD was most clinically relevant in patients with 
concomitant NPM1 and DNMT3A mutations (P=0.009 for three-way interaction in the 
univariate analysis, q= 0.004 in the multivariate analysis) (Fig. 4A). When present with 
either NPM1 or DNMT3A or with neither of these other genes, the effect of FLT3ITD on 
survival was considerably less pronounced. This observation held true regardless of the ratio 
of mutant to wild-type FLT3ITD (Fig. S15 in the Supplementary Appendix).
In contrast, the NPM1–DNMT3A–NRASG12/13 genotype carried an unexpectedly benign 
prognosis in our cohort (P= 0.04 for three-way interaction) (Fig. 4B). Previous reports have 
suggested that NPM1–NRAS is a favorable association,38 something we find specific to 
NPM1–DNMT3A– NRASG12/13. In this cohort, outcomes for patients in the NPM1 
subgroup were strongly dictated by the mutation context in which NPM1 mutations occurred 
(i.e., NRAS, IDH, PTPN11, FLT3, and chromatin–spliceosome mutations) (Fig. S15 in the 
Supplementary Appendix).
Other significant gene–gene interactions were found. In particular, the prognosis was 
significantly poorer than expected for the co-occurrence of FLT3TKD mutations with partial 
tandem duplications of MLL (q= 0.008) and for the co-occurrence of DNMT3A with 
IDH2R140 (q= 0.05) (Fig. 4C and 4D and Table 2).
Discussion
There is a distinction between a system for classifying patients with AML for diagnostic 
purposes and a system for predicting the outcome of AML. The former should be stable and 
durable, based on fixed biologic properties of the disease; hence, the focus on causative 
driver mutations. The latter should be flexible and adaptable, evolving to reflect advances in 
treatment and often being influenced by changes in disease surveillance.39 For example, the 
advent of effective FLT3 and RAS-pathway kinase inhibitors will lead to changes in 
outcome predictions for patients with these mutations but will not fundamentally alter the 
fact that these variants co-occur with class-defining mutations such as t(15;17), t(6;9), and 
NPM1.
It is somewhat counterintuitive that NPM1 emerges as a separate entity, since it appears to 
be a late driver mutation, is almost never found in isolation, and is associated with a clinical 
course that is modified depending on the specific co-occurring mutations. Nonetheless, 
among all the mutations with which it co-occurs, it is the one that most clearly occupies its 
own distinct niche. Why it occurs late is not clear — it may have transformative effects only 
in the context of an epigenetic landscape already shaped by initiating mutations such as 
DNMT3A, TET2, or IDH1/2. NPM1 mutations are not the only route of transformation 
these initiating lesions can follow: when JAK2 mutations occur, myeloproliferative 
neoplasms result, whereas co-mutation with SF3B1 leads to MDS with ring sideroblasts.

 Beyond the existing WHO subgroups, three genomic categories of AML emerge from our 
analysis: chromatin–spliceosome, TP53–aneuploidy, and provisionally, IDH2R172 mutations. 
The chromatin–spliceosome category represents the second largest subgroup of patients with 
AML, even in this intensively treated, relatively young cohort. In contrast to classes defined 
by specific fusion genes, no single gene defines this group. We observed intersecting 
patterns of mutated chromatin and RNA-splicing regulators, suggesting a plasticity of paths 
of disease evolution in this subgroup, yet these genes showed minimal overlap with other 
class-defining lesions. Patients in the chromatin–spliceosome subgroup were, on average, 
older and had lower blast counts and higher rates of antecedent MDS or dysplasia-related 
morphologic features than patients in other subgroups. This overlap should not be 
overstated, however — although 20% of patients had a preceding myeloid disorder or 
evidence of dysplasia as defined by the WHO, 80% did not have such dysplastic features and 
presented with intermediate-risk, de novo AML.
The most widely accepted classification and prognostic schemes for AML include 
cytogenetic lesions together with NPM1, FLT3ITD, and CEBPA.3,26 In the short term, 
TP53, SRSF2, ASXL1, DNMT3A, and IDH2 should be considered for incorporation into 
prognostic guidelines because they are common and exert a strong influence on clinical 
outcomes. For AML classification, evaluation of splicing-factor genes RUNX1, ASXL1, and 
MLLPTD at diagnosis would identify patients in the chromatin–spliceosome group.
In conclusion, we analyzed somatic driver mutations retrospectively in more than 1500 
patients with AML, generated a new genetic approach to disease classification with 
prognostic implications, and obtained similar results for an independent data set from 
TCGA. Prospective clinical studies are needed for further validation of this schema.

 Figure 1. Landscape of Driver Mutations in Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
Panel A shows driver events in 1540 patients with AML. Each bar represents a distinct 
driver lesion; the lesions include gene mutations, chromosomal aneuploidies, fusion genes, 
and complex karyotypes. The colors in each bar indicate the molecular risk according to the 
European LeukemiaNet (ELN) classification. Panel B shows the distribution of samples and 
overlap (cross-sections) across molecular subgroups (vertical bars). Patients who had no 
driver mutations and those who had driver mutations but did not meet the criteria for any 
specific class are also included. The number at the top of each column is the number of

 Figure 2. Identification of Molecular Subgroups in AML.
The rows in the graph represent individual genomic lesions, and the columns represent 
patients in the study. Vertical purple lines (some of which appear as blocks because of 
clustering) indicate the presence of a specified driver mutation in a patient. The patients have 
been ordered by group membership; orange lines demarcate boundaries between classes.

 Figure 3. Molecular Subclassification and Overall Survival.
Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival among patients in the 11 
genomically defined subgroups and patients who did not have a straightforward 
classification. Panel B shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival with the additive and 
independent prognostic effects of TP53 mutation and complex karyotype (TP53 mutation, 
17 patients; complex karyotype, 89; and TP53 mutation with complex karyotype, 70). Panel 
C shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival with the additive and independent 
prognostic effects of ASXL1 and SRSF2 mutations (ASXL1 mutation, 55 patients; SRSF2

 mutation, 74; and ASXL1 and SRSF2 mutations, 15). In Panels B and C, wt denotes wild 
type, and mut mutation. The bar chart in Panel D shows concordance estimates for overall 
survival with the use of variables selected in our model (concordance, approximately 71%) 
as compared with a model using variables considered in the ELN guidelines (concordance, 
approximately 64%). The doughnut chart shows the relative proportion of explained 
variance in overall survival in the full model that is accounted for by different categories of 
predictor variables. Clinical variables are performance status, splenomegaly, bone marrow 
blasts, and blood counts. Demographic variables are age and sex. Nuisance variables are 
other variables (e.g., which trial a patient was enrolled in, what year a patient entered the 
clinical trial, and whether cytogenetic data were missing). The volcano plot in Panel E shows 
the incremental contribution to the effect size (expressed as the logarithmic hazard on the x 
axis; positive values indicate a worsening effect) versus P values (expressed on an inverted 
logarithmic scale on the y axis) for each of the 228 variables included in the random-effects 
model. The circles above the dotted line represent 18 variables with a q value of less than 
0.1; the size of each circle corresponds to the frequency of the variable, as indicated in the 
box. The incremental contribution of age is shown for every 10 years of age, and the 
incremental contribution of the white-cell count (WBC) is shown for each increase of 1×109 
cells per liter. The colors of the circles correspond to the colors shown in the doughnut chart 
in Panel D.

 Figure 4. Influence of Gene–Gene Interactions on Overall Survival.
Panel A shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival according to the presence or 
absence of FLT3ITD. The deleterious prognostic effect of FLT3ITD was significantly greater 
when both DNMT3A and NPM1 were mutated, as shown in the graph at the right (P = 0.009 
for three-way interaction in the univariate analysis; q= 0.004 in the multivariate analysis 
with correction for multiple hypothesis testing). A total of 28 patients had both DNMT3A 
and FLT3ITD, 77 had both NPM1 and FLT3ITD, and 93 had all three mutations. Panel B 
shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival according to the presence or absence of

 NRAS codon 12/13 mutation. The prognostic effect of NRAS codon 12/13 mutation was 
significantly greater when both DNMT3A and NPM1 carried the driver mutation (in 45 
patients), as shown in the graph at the right (P = 0.0007 for three-way interaction in the 
univariate analysis). Panel C shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival according to 
the presence or absence of MLLPTD and FLT3TKD (P = 0.0004 for gene–gene interaction in 
the univariate analysis; q = 0.008 in the multivariate analysis with correction for multiple 
hypothesis testing). A total of 69 patients had MLLPTD, 112 had FLT3TKD, and 10 had both. 
Panel D shows Kaplan–Meier curves for overall survival according to the presence or 
absence of driver mutations in DNMT3A, IDH2R140, or both (P = 0.05 for gene–gene 
interaction in the univariate analysis; q= 0.05 in the multivariate analysis with correction for 
multiple hypothesis testing). A total of 338 patients had DNMT3A, 20 had IDH2R140, and 
19 had both.

*The strongest effect on survival was defined as q<0.1. The effects reported in this table do not take into account the maintenance of favorable outcomes in the context of core-binding leukemias. We did not 
include interactions between fusion genes and copy-number alterations in this analysis, because they are mutually exclusive for the most part and we wanted to limit the number of variables in the model.
