Impact of Resistance Training on
Skeletal Muscle Mitochondrial

Skeletal muscle metabolic and contractile properties are reliant on muscle mitochondrial
and myofibrillar protein turnover. The turnover of these specific protein pools is
compromised during disease, aging, and inactivity. Oppositely, exercise can accentuate
muscle protein turnover, thereby counteracting decay in muscle function. According
to a traditional consensus, endurance exercise is required to drive mitochondrial
adaptations, while resistance exercise is required to drive myofibrillar adaptations.
However, concurrent practice of traditional endurance exercise and resistance exercise
regimens to achieve both types of muscle adaptations is time-consuming, motivationally
demanding, and contended to entail practice at intensity levels, that may not comply
with clinical settings. It is therefore of principle interest to identify effective, yet feasible,
exercise strategies that may positively affect both mitochondrial and myofibrillar protein
turnover. Recently, reports indicate that traditional high-load resistance exercise can
stimulate muscle mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial respiratory function.
Moreover, fatiguing low-load resistance exercise has been shown capable of promoting
muscle hypertrophy and expectedly entails greater metabolic stress to potentially
enhance mitochondrial adaptations. Consequently, fatiguing low-load resistance exercise
regimens may possess the ability to stimulate muscle mitochondrial adaptations without
compromising muscle myofibrillar accretion. However, the exact ability of resistance
exercise to drive mitochondrial adaptations is debatable, not least due to some
methodological challenges. The current review therefore aims to address the evidence on
the effects of resistance exercise on skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, content
and function. In prolongation, a perspective is taken on the specific potential of low-load
resistance exercise on promoting mitochondrial adaptations.

INTRODUCTION
Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that play a key role in metabolism and cellular
homeostasis. Consequently, mitochondrial content and function exert great influence on substrate
utilization capacity and skeletal muscle health, with skeletal muscle mitochondrial abnormalities
implicated in the pathology of chronic disorders such as diabetes, obesity, and peripheral arterial
disease (Kim et al., 2000; Petersen et al., 2004; Rontoyanni et al., 2017).
Synthesis of new mitochondrial reticular components (i.e., mitochondrial biogenesis) has
profound effect on mitochondrial content and function. Mitochondrial biogenesis is reported to
 Groennebaek and Vissing

be attenuated with aging, prolonged inactivity, and/or chronic
disease (Rooyackers et al., 1996a,b; Abadi et al., 2009; Gram et al.,
2014), while metabolic stressors inherent of exercise possess the
ability to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis. In accordance,
metabolic stress inherent of endurance exercise has been
demonstrated to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis (Perry et al.,
2010; Di Donato et al., 2014), which, when repeated through
prolonged training (i.e., endurance training), can accumulate
into adaptational changes in mitochondrial content and function
(Hoppeler et al., 1985; Jacobs and Lundby, 2013). Employment
of animal models and omics-based studies has improved our
understanding
on
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
endurance
exercise-induced
mitochondrial
biogenesis.
Accordingly, alterations in intramuscular homeostasis (e.g.,
alterations in AMP, calcium, and reactive oxygen species)
inferred by endurance exercise are described to exert regulatory
action on specific proteins involved in transcriptional regulation
of mitochondrial biogenesis, such as calcium/calmodulin-
dependent protein kinase (CaMK), AMP-activated protein
kinase (AMPK), and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase
(p38-MAPK) (Hawley et al., 1995; Wright et al., 2007; Combes
et al., 2015).
With regards to resistance exercise, high-load resistance
exercise has been demonstrated to stimulate myofibrillar protein
accretion, which upon prolonged training (i.e., resistance
training) can accumulate into muscle hypertrophy (ACSM,
2009). However, the necessity of conducting resistance exercise
with high loads has more recently been challenged by studies
demonstrating that low-load resistance exercise performed to
volitional fatigue, is equally capable as high-load resistance
exercise in stimulating myofibrillar accretion and muscle growth
(Burd et al., 2010; Mitchell et al., 2012; Farup et al., 2015).
Interestingly, several studies also suggest that resistance exercise
can stimulate myocellular signaling for mitochondrial biogenesis,
albeit to a relatively lesser degree than endurance exercise
and depending on training status and exercise principles
employed (Coffey et al., 2006; Wilkinson et al., 2008; Vissing
et al., 2013). However, the impact of differentiated resistance
exercise regimens on skeletal muscle mitochondrial adaptations
remain rather overlooked, despite potential clinical significance.
In accordance, such knowledge could be beneficial in the
attempt to identify a therapeutic exercise-based strategy that
enable concurrent effect on mitochondrial and myofribrillar
adaptations.
Below we provide a summary on the current knowledge on
how resistance exercise affects skeletal muscle mitochondrial
biogenesis
and
whether
repeated
resistance
exercise
can
enhance mitochondrial content and function. As different
methodological approaches have produced discrepancies in
results, some important methodological issues will also be
addressed. Oppositely, while the importance of mitochondrial
degradation (e.g., mitophagy) is acknowledged, this will not be
addressed. The summarized knowledge is retrieved from human
studies, as animal models that render voluntary resistance
exercise possible are lacking. Finally, since most studies on
human resistance exercise have utilized high loads, we will
discuss the perspectives of using low-load resistance exercise to
stimulate mitochondrial adaptations in clinical populations that
may be less able to perform high-load resistance exercise.
ACUTE EFFECTS OF SINGLE-BOUT
RESISTANCE EXERCISE ON MUSCLE
MITOCHONDRIAL BIOGENESIS
Mitochondria are dynamic organelles residing in reticular
networks and constantly adapting to accommodate new demands
by processes such as biogenesis, mitophagy, fission and fusion
(Kirkwood et al., 1986), with the process of mitochondrial
biogenesis so far having received most attention in exercise
physiology research.
Mitochondrial biogenesis has previously been evaluated
from biomarkers of mitochondrial content and/or expression
of metabolic transcripts. However, it has been argued that
the first approach provides information on quantity rather
than biogenesis per se and that the second approach does
not appreciate the potentially attenuating effect of exercise-
induced ATP-turnover on regulation of muscle protein synthesis,
thus rendering direct measurements of fractional mitochondrial
protein synthesis (MitoPS) rate, necessary (Miller and Hamilton,
2012; Miller et al., 2016).
Only very few studies have investigated the effect of resistance
exercise on MitoPS. These studies suggest that both MitoPS
and myofibrillar protein synthesis (MyoPS) rate increase during
early recovery (i.e., 0–4 h) after single-bout high-load resistance
exercise in healthy individuals in the untrained state (Wilkinson
et al., 2008; Donges et al., 2012). On the other hand, stimulation
of MitoPS, but not MyoPS, seems to be attenuated when single-
bout high-load resistance exercise is conducted in a resistance
exercise-accustomed state (Wilkinson et al., 2008). Interestingly,
low-load resistance exercise performed with slow and tonic
contraction phase and conducted to volitional fatigue has been
reported to increase MitoPS rate during both early (i.e., 0–
6 h) and later (i.e., 24–30 h) post-exercise recovery as well as
MyoPS rate during later recovery (i.e., 24–30 h) in healthy,
young, resistance exercise-accustomed individuals (Burd et al.,
2012). Consequently, resistance exercise does in fact seem able
to stimulate mitochondrial biogenesis, although in a manner
depending on training status and the magnitude of metabolic
stress imposed.
However, it is important to note that the above-mentioned
studies investigated MitoPS in the fed state, while none of
these studies implemented non-exercise control experiments to
preclude independent effects of dietary condition (i.e., feeding
or fasting) (Vissing et al., 2005). For instance, amino acid
administration has been observed to stimulate MitoPS rate
(Bohe et al., 2003), which also implies a role for the amino
acid-sensitive signaling protein mechanistic target of rapamycin
(mTOR) in regulating MitoPS. On the other hand, the exact
role of mTOR for MitoPS seems complex, since resting as
well as EE-induced MitoPS is maintained despite rapamycin
mediated-mTOR inhibition in mice (Drake et al., 2013; Philp
et al., 2015), which indicates that regulation of MitoPS may
underlie mTOR-independent signaling mechanisms. Moreover,

Mitochondrial Adaptations to Resistance Training
it is also interesting to note that the anabolic effects of
amino acid administration on MitoPS are suppressed when
insulin release is inhibited by somatostatin (Robinson et al.,
2014). Teasing out such dietary effects from those of exercise
requires implementations of independent non-exercise control
experiments. In fact, Robinson et al. (2017) did implement
a control intervention in a study investigating the effect of
resistance exercise on MitoPS (Robinson et al., 2017). In this
study, the authors did not evaluate acute changes in MitoPS,
but rather basal MitoPS before and after prolonged high-
load resistance training in healthy young and aging cohorts.
Interestingly, they observed that basal MitoPS rate was increased
in resistance trained aging, but not young individuals, implying
that greater sensitivity exists with increasing age.
Also noteworthy, previous human studies on the effect of
resistance exercise on MitoPS, are based on infusion of stabile
isotope-marked amino acids or alfa-keto acids. The inherent
invasive nature and demand for continuous infusion limits
this approach to information on proteins with relatively fast
turnover rate (i.e., hours), while not allowing for investigation
on the synthesis rate of proteins with slower turnover rate (i.e.,
days-weeks) and/or cumulative exercise training effects (Miller
et al., 2015). Furthermore, intravenous administration of amino
acids may in itself or indirectly, due to stimulation of insulin
secretion, confound readings of protein synthesis (Bohe et al.,
2003; Robinson et al., 2014), at least when using quantities
inherent of the flooding dose technique (Jahoor et al., 1992;
Smith et al., 1998). More recent methodological advances in
mass spectrometry have reintroduced the use of the stable
isotope, deuterium oxide (D2O), allowing these limitations to
be circumvented. In accordance, D2O is orally administered,
and rapidly equilibrates throughout body water compartments
and facilitates intrinsic labeling of amino acids and nucleic
acids (Dufner et al., 2005; Busch et al., 2006). This allows
for measurements of MitoPS over prolonged periods of time,
while simultaneously avoiding intravenous administration of
amino acids (Robinson et al., 2011). Consequently, it reduces
the need for complex decisions on dietary standardization,
diurnal rhythm, or invasive procedures inherent of single-bout
experiments. Yet, whereas such methodological advances can
provide added insight on mitochondrial biogenesis, it is not
directly telling on more permanent adaptations in mitochondrial
content.
EFFECT OF PROLONGED RESISTANCE
TRAINING ON MUSCLE MITOCHONDRIAL
CONTENT
Multiple analytical approaches are available for assessment of
mitochondrial content. Among these, electron microscopy-based
determination of mitochondrial volume density is regarded
as the golden standard (Larsen et al., 2012). However, the
studies utilizing electron microscopy to deduce resistance
training-induced adaptational changes in mitochondrial volume
density are few and characterized by methodological constraints,
such as low sample size and absence of control experiments.
These methodological constraints notwithstanding, two previous
studies utilizing electron microscopy surprisingly suggest a
dilution of mitochondrial volume density to occur following
high-load resistance training in young men (MacDougall et al.,
1979; Luthi et al., 1986).
Most studies on the effect of resistance training on
mitochondrial content rely on utilization of citrate synthase
(CS) activity as a biomarker, because CS activity has been
shown to exhibit a degree of association with mitochondrial
volume density determined by electron microscopy, while
simultaneously offering a significantly less time-consuming
approach (Larsen et al., 2012; Meinild Lundby et al., 2017).
However, results from studies on high-load resistance training in
young untrained individuals that employ measures of CS activity
are somewhat equivocal, with most studies reporting unaltered
CS activity (Tesch et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1993; Wilkinson
et al., 2008; Porter et al., 2015), whereas other studies report
either decreased (Kon et al., 2014) or increased (Tang et al.,
2006) CS activity. A similar discordance is evident from studies
evaluating the effect of high-load resistance training on single
fiber mitochondrial content by use of histochemical staining for
succinate dehydrogenase (Ploutz et al., 1994; Chilibeck et al.,
1999; Green et al., 1999; Bell et al., 2000).
In conclusion, while these divergent results may in part
adhere to the degree of muscle hypertrophy achieved (Tang
et al., 2006), they are also the product of a number of small-
scale studies, with only few to include control experiments and
with the vast majority of these studies relying on surrogate
markers of mitochondrial content. More recently, a study
that has used electron microscopy to evaluate mitochondrial
cristae density after prolonged endurance training, suggests
that mitochondrial cristae density may provide a stronger
predictor of an individual’s maximal oxygen uptake compared to
mitochondrial volume density (Nielsen et al., 2016). Still, whereas
insight on mitochondrial volume density and cristae density
can provide relevant information on permanent quantitative
changes, such measures are not necessarily telling on adaptations
in mitochondrial function.
EFFECT OF PROLONGED RESISTANCE
TRAINING ON MUSCLE MITOCHONDRIAL
RESPIRATORY FUNCTION
Utilization of high resolution respirometry in permeabillized
myofibers and/or isolated mitochondria from muscle biopsies
may allow for a more physiologically relevant approach to study
mitochondrial function (Haller et al., 1994; Kuznetsov et al.,
2008). In this regard, a recent study utilizing high resolution
respirometry in permeabilized myofibers observed increased
maximal coupled respiration supported by electron transfer
from complex 1 and 2 after 12 weeks of high-load resistance
training in young, untrained subjects, with only a modest
(and non-significant) increase in CS activity (Porter et al.,
2015). This implies that the maximal ATP-producing capacity
can be improved independently of changes in mitochondrial
content. Similarly, by a comparative approach also utilizing
high resolution respirometry in permeabilized myofibers, Pesta
et al. (2011) found identical magnitudes of improvements in
Frontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org

Mitochondrial Adaptations to Resistance Training
intrinsic mitochondrial function following 10 weeks of high-
load resistance training and endurance training undertaken
under normoxic as well as hypoxic conditions, although it
needs to be emphasized that only three participants completed
the
normoxic
high-load
resistance
training-intervention.
Furthermore, the authors employed measures of mitochondrial
DNA as a biomarker, which has elsewhere been contended to
constitute a poor predictor of mitochondrial content (Larsen
et al., 2012). Further supporting these findings, a cross-sectional
study reported higher maximal coupled respiration and tighter
coupling of oxidative phosphorylation (suggestive of increased
efficiency of the phosphorylation system) in permeabilized
myofibers of highly resistance trained subjects compared
to untrained controls, despite no differences in CS activity
(Salvadego et al., 2013). Such qualitative adaptations may be
ascribed simply to increased abundance of electron transport
chain complexes following prolonged high-load resistance
training (Porter et al., 2015), but may also rely on other
contributing
mechanisms.
Accordingly,
recent
pioneering
studies have provided evidence for increased assemblies of
respiratory supercomplexes as well as increased mitochondrial
cristae density in response to long term endurance training,
thus facilitating qualitative modulation of oxidative capacity
(Nielsen et al., 2016; Greggio et al., 2017). Whether similar
adaptational changes also adhere to resistance training, remain
to be investigated.
Peculiarly, contrary to studies on permeabilized fibers,
employment of high resolution respirometry on isolated
mitochondria indicates little effect of high-load resistance
training on mitochondrial function. In accordance, two recent
randomized controlled studies collectively favor the contention
that high-load resistance training is not able to augment
mitochondrial respiratory function (Irving et al., 2015; Robinson
et al., 2017). It can be speculated that the discordance in
results between analyses on permeabilized fibers vs. isolated
mitochondria stem from organelle interactions inherent of
the normal milieu of the muscle cell. Hence, in the living
cell, mitochondria exist in fused networks with preserved
interactions with other organelles such as the endoplasmic
reticulum and the cytoskeleton (Kirkwood et al., 1986; Rizzuto
et al., 1998). From this perspective, analysis on permeabilized
myofibers can be considered as more closely resembling genuine
physiological conditions. Oppositely, mitochondrial isolation
procedures can be contended to disrupt the mitochondrial
structure and consequently interfere with respiratory function
(Picard et al., 2011), but this needs to be further investigated.
For
comprehensive
considerations
on
the
utilization
of
permeabilized fibers vs. isolated mitochondria, we refer to a
previous report (Kuznetsov et al., 2008).
SUMMARY: EFFECTS OF RESISTANCE
EXERCISE ON MUSCLE MITOCHONDRIAL
ADAPTATIONS
The
results
of
relevant
resistance
exercise
studies
on
mitochondrial biogenesis, content, and function are summarized
in Table 1.
Judged from the ability to increase MitoPS, single-bout low-
load as well as high-load resistance exercise can stimulate
human
muscle
mitochondrial
biogenesis.
However,
the
influence on resistance exercise-induced MitoPS of training
status, resistance exercise principles, and dietary conditions
inherent of experimental protocols, deserves further attention.
Implementation
of
non-exercise
control
experiments
and
utilization of tracers, allowing for assessment of proteins with
slower turnover rate, may substantially aid such investigation.
With regards to accumulated effects of high-load resistance
training on permanent mitochondrial adaptations, results remain
more equivocal. In accordance, interpretation of studies on
mitochondrial content is hampered by evaluation from surrogate
markers of mitochondrial content and/or limited sample size.
Utilization of electron microscopy combined with sufficient
statistical power, would likely allow for more firm conclusions.
As judged from the ability to increase mitochondrial respiration,
high-load
resistance
exercise
can
stimulate
mitochondrial
function. Yet, since this has so far only been reported from studies
on permeabilized fibers, but not confirmed in studies on isolated
mitochondria, this specific methodological aspect also requires
further attention.
To recapitulate, an accumulating burden of proof favors
the contention that high-load resistance training can promote
mitochondrial adaptations. Yet, future studies considering some
of the factors mentioned above, are warranted before firm
conclusion can be made. Furthermore, virtually all previous
studies have employed high-load resistance exercise, while still
leaving it interesting if low-load resistance exercise can stimulate
mitochondrial adaptations.
CONSIDERATIONS ON THE UTILIZATION
OF LOW-LOAD RESISTANCE EXERCISE
TO STIMULATE MUSCLE
MITOCHONDRIAL ADAPTATIONS
From a clinical perspective, it is highly interesting that high-
load resistance training possess a more pronounced ability to
augment mitochondrial adaptations in older adults (Jubrias et al.,
2001; Melov et al., 2007; Robinson et al., 2017) and patients
with certain chronic disorders (Balakrishnan et al., 2010; Sparks
et al., 2013) characterized by mitochondrial abnormalities. This
higher consistency than observed in healthy young individuals is
likely simply explained by a greater potential for improvement
(i.e., lower basal mitochondrial biogenesis inherent of such
populations; Rooyackers et al., 1996a,b), which may translate
into more robust adaptational changes with prolonged resistance
training.
However, whereas current evidence supports that high-load
resistance training can stimulate mitochondrial adaptations in
clinical populations, high loading may not always be feasible in
specific subpopulations. It is therefore interesting that one study
by Burd et al. (2012) supports that low-load resistance exercise
can stimulate MitoPS. In accordance, the authors observed
a robust increase in MitoPS rate after low-load resistance
exercise performed with a slow and tonic contraction phase and
conducted to volitional fatigue. It is also interesting to note from

the study by Burd et al. (2012), that the increased MitoPS rate was
observed in subjects with more than 2 years of prior resistance
training experience, as this indicates that acute increases in
MitoPS rate are not merely to be ascribed a general stress due
to lack of exercise habituation.
Fatiguing low-load and/or high-volume resistance exercise
has been shown to produce greater ATP turnover compared
to traditional high-load resistance exercise (Gorostiaga et al.,
2012; Ahtiainen et al., 2015). Furthermore, fatiguing low-load
resistance exercise conducted with slow and tonic contraction
phase or application of external restriction of blood flow to the
exercising muscle, has been shown to impose a more pronounced
decrease in tissue oxygenation compared to traditionally
performed high- and low-load resistance exercise (Tanimoto and
Ishii, 2006; Karabulut et al., 2014; Lauver et al., 2017). It therefore
seems plausible that fatiguing low-load resistance exercise entail
greater metabolic stress, to potentially accentuate mitochondrial
biogenesis.
While traditional low-load resistance exercise performed
to volitional fatigue may offer a less mechanically strenuous
alternative, it must still be regarded strenuous in terms of
time and effort. In this regard, low-load blood flow restricted
resistance exercise may offer an alternative in specific cohorts.
In accordance, the added ischemia inherent of low-load blood
flow restricted resistance exercise has been demonstrated to
substantially reduce the time required to reach a point of
volitional fatigue and thereby reduce the required work volume,
while still stimulating muscle accretion equally much as free-
flow low-load resistance exercise performed to fatigue (Farup
et al., 2015). On the other hand, blood flow restricted resistance
exercise may entail discomfort, especially in the unaccustomed
state, so further investigation is required on the feasibility
of this approach for clinical populations. Future comparative
studies on stimulation of muscle mitochondrial adaptations
with fatiguing low-load resistance training (traditional and/or
blood flow restricted) vs. high-load resistance training, would be
interesting to perform on healthy as well as patient populations.
