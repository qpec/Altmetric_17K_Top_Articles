IntroductIon
Regulatory T (T reg) cells maintain immune homeostasis 
and play a pivotal role in immune tolerance. Forkhead box 
protein 3 (Foxp3) is a major transcription factor that is as-
sociated with T reg cell development and function (Ouyang 
et al., 2010). Mutations or deletions of the Foxp3 gene re-
sult in IPEX syndrome (immunodysregulation, polyendo-
crinopathy, and enteropathy, with X-linked inheritance) in 
humans. IPEX syndrome is an autoimmune disease associated 
with eczema, severe enteropathy, type I diabetes, thyroiditis, 
hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia (Bennett et al., 
2001). Recently, a Foxp3 mutation has been also identified 
in a two-generation family with inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD; Okou et al., 2014). several other gene defects that af-
fect the function of T reg cells give rise to IPEX-like syn-
dromes, including mutations or deficiency in the α-chain of 
the IL-2 receptor (CD25), signal transducer and activator of 
transcription 5b (STAT5b), Itchy E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 
(ITCH), STAT1, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte–associated protein 
4 (CTLA4), and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS; Massaad 
et al., 2013; 
Verbsky and Chatila, 2013).
The scurfy (SF) mouse, which bears a mutation in the 
Foxp3 gene, displays a similar clinical phenotype, with early 
onset dermatitis, progressive multiorgan inflammation, and 
death within the first month of life caused by a lympho-
proliferative syndrome (Godfrey et al., 1991a,b; Sharma et 
al., 2009). The lethal lymphoproliferative syndrome has been 
shown to be predominately mediated by CD4+ Th1 and Th2 
cell–induced pathology (Blair et al., 1994; Kanangat et al., 
1996; Sharma et al., 2009, 2011; Suscovich et al., 2012), similar 
to what is seen in patients with IPEX syndrome (Zennaro et 
al., 2012; Baris et al., 2014). T
o date, treatment with immuno-
regulatory t (t reg) cell deficiency causes lethal, cd4+ t cell–driven autoimmune diseases. Stem cell transplantation is used 
to treat these diseases, but this procedure is limited by the availability of a suitable donor. the intestinal microbiota drives host 
immune homeostasis by regulating the differentiation and expansion of t reg, th1, and th2 cells. It is currently unclear if t 
reg cell deficiency–mediated autoimmune disorders can be treated by targeting the enteric microbiota. Here, we demonstrate 
that Foxp3+ t reg cell deficiency results in gut microbial dysbiosis and autoimmunity over the lifespan of scurfy (SF) mouse. 
remodeling microbiota with Lactobacillus reuteri prolonged survival and reduced multiorgan inflammation in SF mice. L. reu-
teri changed the metabolomic profile disrupted by t reg cell deficiency, and a major effect was to restore levels of the purine 
metabolite inosine. Feeding inosine itself prolonged life and inhibited multiorgan inflammation by reducing th1/th2 cells and 
their associated cytokines. Mechanistically, the inhibition of inosine on the differentiation of th1 and th2 cells in vitro de-
pended on adenosine A2A receptors, which were also required for the efficacy of inosine and of L. reuteri in vivo. these results 
reveal that the microbiota–inosine–A2A receptor axis might represent a potential avenue for combatting autoimmune diseases 
mediated by t reg cell dysfunction.

suppressive drugs in combination with supportive care, such 
as total parental nutrition (TPN) and blood transfusion, may 
help to palliate clinical manifestations (Hannibal and T
orger-
son, 2011). Transplantation of donor T reg cells and stem cells 
is promising, but the procedure is limited by the availability 
of a suitable donor; and the ultimate outcome can be fatal or 
associated with chronic health problems (Rao et al., 2007; Se-
idel et al., 2009; Burroughs et al., 2010; Nademi et al., 2014).
The intestinal microbiota drives host immune homeo-
stasis by regulating the differentiation and expansion of T reg 
cells (Round and Mazmanian, 2010; Arpaia et al., 2013; Furu-
sawa et al., 2013; Weng and Walker, 2013; Belkaid and Hand, 
2014). Intestinal microbial dysbiosis can develop as a result of 
an abnormal diet, infection, inflammation, and altered host 
genetics (Lupp et al., 2007; David et al., 2014; Goodrich et al., 
2014; Lukens et al., 2014). Gut microbial dysbiosis can lead to 
autoimmune diseases, including IBD, autoimmune arthritis, 
type I diabetes, and experimental autoimmune encephalomy-
elitis (EAE; Cerf-Bensussan and Gaboriau-Routhiau, 2010; 
Wu and Wu, 2012; Markle et al., 2013). However, the host–
microbiota interactions in monogenic autoimmune diseases 
largely remain unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that (i) 
T reg cell deficiency caused by a Foxp3 mutation disrupted 
the gut microbiota; and (ii) 
T reg cell deficiency–mediated au-
toimmune disease can be treated by targeting gut microbiota.
Probiotics have the capacity to not only induce large-
scale changes in the host microbiota composition but also 
modulate the global metabolic function of intestinal microbi-
omes (Hemarajata and Versalovic, 2013; Sanders et al., 2013). 
Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) demonstrates beneficial at-
tributes caused by a mutualistic relationship between microbe 
and host (Walter et al., 2011). L. reuteri DSM17938 is effec-
tive in treating and preventing diseases that affect infants and 
children, including necrotizing enterocolitis, diarrhea, and in-
fantile colic (Urbańska and Szajewska, 2014). L. reuteri mod-
ulates the abnormal microbial communities associated with 
these diseases (Mai et al., 2006; Rhoads et al., 2009; T
orrazza 
and Neu, 2013; Patel and Denning, 2015).
In this study, we characterize the dynamic changes of 
autoimmunity and gut microbial dysbiosis over the short 
lifespan of the Foxp3+ T reg cell–deficient SF mouse. We 
demonstrate a shift in resident microbiota after treatment 
with probiotic L. reuteri in SF mice, which consequently 
inhibits the degree of autoimmunity. Protective effects of a 
microbiota-modulated metabolite, inosine, against T reg cell 
deficiency–induced autoimmunity were identified. Our study 
highlights the immunomodulatory mechanism by which re-
modeling microbiota and inosine counteract T reg cell defi-
ciency–induced autoimmunity.
reSuLtS
t reg cell deficiency changes the gut microbiota
Because human genetic factors can shape the gut microbiome 
(Goodrich et al., 2014), we initially explored whether gut 
microbiota would be altered by the Foxp3 gene mutation. 
We 
conducted a dynamic study of autoimmunity and gut micro-
biota in Foxp3+ 
T reg cell–deficient scurfy (SF) mice, compar-
ing WT littermates to SF mice at day 8 (d8), d15, and d22 of 
age. We observed that SF mice develop chronic inflammation 
in several tissues (liver, lung, ear, and tail; Fig. S1, A–E) and ac-
quire an increase the frequency of IFN-γ–producing CD4+ 
T 
(Th1) and IL-4–producing CD4+ T (Th2) cells in the spleen 
and mesenteric LNs (MLNs; Fig. 1 A and Fig. S1 G). Also, 
plasma levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 were increased as early as d8, 
at a time when a SF clinical phenotype had not been demon-
strated (Fig. 1 B). However, Th17 cells were not increased in 
spleen and MLN of SF mice from d15 to d22 (Fig. S1, F and 
G), suggesting that Th1 and Th2 responses are the main driv-
ers of autoimmunity in T reg cell–deficient SF mice.
Gut microbial dysbiosis developed over the first 22 d of 
life in SF mice (compared with WT littermates), as revealed 
by stool 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis at d8, d15, and 
d22. First, Shannon α diversity was significantly decreased in 
SF mice compared with WT littermates at d22 (Fig. 1 C). 
Second, weighted UniFrac-based three-dimensional princi-
pal coordinates analysis (PCoA) revealed a distinctly shifted 
gut microbial composition between SF and WT (Fig. 1 D). 
Longitudinal analysis of the relative abundance of gut micro-
bial communities in these mice indicated broad population 
changes from the phylum to the genus levels in SF compared 
with WT mice, suggesting that Foxp3+ T reg cell deficiency 
shapes gut microbial community structure (Fig. 1 E and Fig. 
S1 H). For example, the relative abundance of Lactobacillus 
was significantly lower in SF stool compared with that in 
WT 
stool at d8 (P < 0.001; Fig. 1 F). Bacteroides was significantly 
higher abundance in SF than in WT stool at d22 (P < 0.001; 
Fig. 1 F). In summary, whereas sampling across time, we ob-
served that development of autoimmunity was accompanied 
by microbial dysbiosis.
Lactobacillus reuteri treatment reprograms gut microbiota 
in t reg cell deficiency
We further examined whether gut microbiota shaped by T 
reg cell deficiency can be reprogrammed by oral administra-
tion of probiotic L. reuteri. Stool microbiota were analyzed 
when L. reuteri was orally fed by gavage, 107 CFU/day, daily, 
starting on d8 for 2 wk (early treatment) or on d15 for 1 wk 
(late treatment). We found that L. reuteri given either early or 
later produced similar effects in resetting gut microbial dysbi-
osis in SF mice. The decreased Shannon α diversity associated 
with T reg cell deficiency was reversed by L. reuteri early or 
late treatment (P < 0.05; Fig. 2 A and Fig. S2 F). A three- 
dimensional PCoA and nonparametrical multiple dimen-
sional scaling analysis revealed that SF mice with L. reuteri 
treatment displayed a shift in microbial community compo-
sition, which was distinct from either WT or SF populations 
(Fig. 2, B and C; and Fig. S2 G). According to our evaluation 
of predominant bacteria from the phylum to genus level, L. 
reuteri specifically increased the relative abundance of the 
phylum Firmicutes and the genera Lactobacillus and Oscil-
 109

lospira, and decreased the relative abundance of the phylum 
T
enericutes and the genus Bacteroides (Fig. 2, D–F; and Fig. 
S2, H and I). Further analysis at the species level of Lactoba-
cillus showed that the relative abundances of L. reuteri and L. 
others significantly increased after oral feeding of L. reuteri 
to SF mice compared with that of SF mice without L. re-
uteri treatment (Fig. 2 G). These results indicated that gut 
microbial dysbiosis induced by T reg cell deficiency could be 
reprogramed by oral administration of L. reuteri.
remodeling gut microbiota by L. reuteri suppresses 
autoimmunity induced by t reg cell deficiency
Gut microbiota play an important role in regulating host im-
mune homeostasis (Wu and Wu, 2012; Belkaid and Hand, 
2014). To determine whether remodeling gut microbiota by 
L. reuteri could globally impact T reg cell deficiency–associ-
ated autoimmunity, the survival and inflammation of SF mice 
were evaluated after orally feeding L. reuteri, starting on d8 
(early treatment, to infinity for survival; and to 2 wk for tis-
sue analysis; Fig. 3 A). SF mice (as expected) died between 
d21 and d30 as a result of lymphoproliferative syndrome and 
severe multiorgan inflammation (Fig. 3, B–G). However, the 
survival rate of SF mice with L. reuteri early treatment was 
significantly increased to at least 125 d (Fig. 3 B). In addi-
tion, L. reuteri significantly reduced inflammatory infiltra-
tion measured by the mean area of lymphocyte infiltration 
in liver and lung (P < 0.001; Fig. 3, C and D).

CD4+ T (Th2) cells in the spleen and MLNs of SF mice 
were significantly reduced by L. reuteri treatment, respec-
tively (Fig. 3, E and F). Furthermore, the levels of IFN-γ and 
IL-4 in plasma of SF mice were significantly decreased by L. 
reuteri treatment (Fig. 3 G).
We also tested the therapeutic effects of L. reuteri in 
SF mice, beginning once they demonstrated overt clinical 
symptoms, on d15; we continued L. reuteri or Lactobacil-
lus acidophilus DDS (La DDS) as a control for 2 wk (late 
treatment; Fig. S2 A). La DDS has been shown to lack the 
properties of adherence to epithelial cells, induction of mucin 
expression by intestinal epithelial cells, inhibition of entero-
pathogenic E. coli epithelial cell adherence, and inhibition of 
NF-κB (Mack et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2012). We found that L. 
reuteri significantly increased the survival of SF mice (P < 
0.0001; Fig. S2 B). Interestingly, the survival of SF mice was 
improved even after terminating oral feeding of L. reuteri on 
d29, indicating that L. reuteri may induce a persistent shift 
of gut microbiota in SF mice. In contrast, La DDS had a 
lesser effect on SF survival than L. reuteri (P = 0.0149 vs. SF 
mice; P = 0.0024 vs. SF+L. reuteri; Fig. S2 B). L. reuteri but 
not La DDS late treatment reduced inflammatory infiltra-
tion in liver and lung, inhibited Th1/Th2 cells in the spleen, 
and reduced plasma levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 (Fig. S2, C–E). 
Altogether, these results demonstrate that remodeling gut 
microbiota by L. reuteri suppresses autoimmunity mediated 
by T reg cell deficiency.
Metabolomic profiles are modulated by t reg cell deficiency 
and L. reuteri treatment

2012; Dorrestein et al., 2014; Lee and Hase, 2014), we analyzed 
metabolomic profiles of plasma and feces obtained from WT, 
SF
, and SF with L. reuteri given before overt symptoms (early 
treatment; SFL). We measured 525 metabolites in the plasma 
of WT, SF
, and SFL mice (Table S1). The PCoA and heat map 
of the metabolites indicate that T reg cell deficiency affected 
plasma metabolomic profiles, and that L. reuteri treatment 
had a significant impact on plasma metabolome associated 
with T reg cell deficiency (Fig. 4, A and B). T reg cell defi-
ciency led to significant alterations in 51% (269/525) of all 
detected metabolites in plasma, whereas L. reuteri treatment 
changed 5.5% (29/525) of all detected metabolites compared 
with SF (Fig. 4 C and 
Table S1). 
We further studied 29 plasma 
metabolites that were significantly altered by T reg cell defi-
ciency and focused specifically on which metabolites were 
restored to WT control levels by L. reuteri (Fig. 4 D). We ob-
served that the purine metabolite inosine was decreased five-
fold in SF
, but was completely restored by L. reuteri treatment 
(Fig. 4, D and E). Other metabolites involved in inosine me-
tabolism, including adenosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, 
were altered by T reg cell deficiency, but were only partially 
restored by L. reuteri treatment (Fig. 4 E and Fig. S3 A).
A total of 657 metabolites in feces of WT, SF
, and SFL 
mice could be detected (Fig. S3 B and Table S2). We found 
that 11% (76/657) of all detected metabolites in feces were 
altered by T reg cell deficiency compared with WT, whereas 
L. reuteri treatment changed 6% (42/657) of all detected me-
tabolites compared with SF (Fig. S3 C and Table S2). Nota-
bly, the levels of metabolites of inosine metabolism, including 
adenosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, were not changed by 
either T reg cell deficiency or L. reuteri treatment. In feces, 
adenosine levels trended to be low and inosine was signifi-
cantly decreased in L. reuteri–fed mice (Fig. S3 D). Because 
plasma inosine levels reverted to normal, we postulated that

the reduced inosine in feces might be related to the increased 
absorption. T
o address this hypothesis, we measured the villus 
height and crypt depth, and we examined the expression lev-
els of the intestinal nucleoside transporters equilibrative nu-
cleoside transporter 1 (ENT1) and concentrative nucleoside 
transporter 2 (CNT2; Ward et al., 2000; Okada et al., 2006). 
Indeed, we found that L. reuteri treatment was associated 
with improvement of villus height and increased expression 
of intestinal nucleoside transporters ENT1 and CNT2 (Fig. 
S4, A–D). The changes of inosine in plasma associated with 
T reg cell deficiency and reversed by L. reuteri suggest that 
the inosine levels modulated by gut microbiota may play an 
important role in the mechanism of action of this probiotic.
Inosine inhibits th1/th2 differentiation via 
adenosine A2A receptors
Inosine has been reported to have immunomodulatory effects 
on immune cells, such as macrophages (Haskó et al., 2004). It 
is necessary to know the effects of inosine on the differentia-
tion and proliferation of T cells, because T reg cell deficiency 
results in an early immunopathology driven by 
Th1/Th2 cells 
and their associated cytokines in SF mice (Fig. 1, A and B;

and Fig. S1 G). Naive CD4+ T cells isolated from spleens of 
C57BL/6J mice can differentiate into Th1 and Th2 cells in 
vitro in the presence of specific stimulatory/inhibitory cy-
tokines (Zhou et al., 2009). Inosine was added during the 
process of cell differentiation to test whether inosine affects 
this process. Results indicated that the relative mRNA ex-
pression of IFN-γ was increased in naive T cells with Th1 
differentiation media, from 10.3 ± 0.8 at 24 h to 78.3 ± 5.1 
at 72 h culture, compared with Th0 in a medium without 
Th1 differentiation antibodies and cytokines (Fig. 5 A). In-
creased mRNA expression of IFN-γ was inhibited by inosine 
(Fig. 5 A). Inosine also inhibited mRNA expression of IL-4 
in naive 
T cells with 
Th2 differentiation media, at both 24 and 
72 h (Fig. 5 B). The frequency of IFN-γ–producing CD4+ 
Th1 cells and IL-4–producing CD4+ Th2 cells derived from 
naive CD4+ T cell differentiation and analyzed by flow cy-
tometry also indicated that inosine inhibited 
Th1/Th2 differ-
entiation (Fig. 5, C and D). However, it appears that inosine 
had no effects on the proliferation of B- and T
-lymphocytes 
in vitro (Fig. S5, A–C).
Inosine is an agonist of adenosine receptors, which are 
required for the protective effects of inosine in vivo (Gomez 
and Sitkovsky, 2003; Haskó et al., 2004; Nascimento et al., 
2010; Rahimian et al., 2010; da Rocha Lapa et al., 2013; Muto 
et al., 2014; Welihinda et al., 2016). One of the major path-
ways for T reg cells controlling T effector cells (Th1/Th2) is

the adenosine A2A pathway (Deaglio et al., 2007; Csóka et al., 
2008; Antonioli et al., 2013). We explored which isoforms of 
adenosine receptors contribute to the inhibition of inosine 
on Th1/Th2 differentiation. We initially examined the ex-
pression levels of 4 adenosine receptors (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) 
on CD4+ T cells, and we showed that Th cells mainly express 
A1 and A2A receptors. Receptor levels could not be changed 
by inosine treatment (Fig. S5, D and E). T
o further examine 
which adenosine receptors specifically mediate the effect of 
inosine, we isolated naive CD4+ T cells from mice genetically 
deficient in the A1, A2A, A2B, or A3 receptor (A1

−/− mice, respectively). Findings indicated that 
the inhibition by inosine of Th1/Th2 differentiation was ab-
sent in mice with A2A receptor deficiency, but not with defi-
ciency of A1, A2B, or A3 receptors (Fig. 5, C and D). Thus, we 
concluded that the immunomodulatory effect of inosine was 
mediated by A2A receptors.
We further confirmed that inosine increased the down-
stream mediator of A2A signaling, intracellular cyclic adenos-
ine monophosphate (cAMP). 
We found that inosine enhanced 
the cAMP level in 
WT 
Th1/Th2 cells, but not in A2A
−/− 
Th1/
Th2 cells (Fig. 5, E and F), further supporting the concept 
that inosine activates adenosine the A2A receptor in Th1/Th2 
cells. Altogether, these results provide strong evidence that 
inosine inhibits Th1/Th2 differentiation in an adenosine A2A 
receptor–dependent manner.
the therapeutic effect of inosine on t reg cell–deficient SF 
mice is mediated by A2A receptors
T reg cells control 
Th1/Th2 mediated by A2A receptors (Dea-
glio et al., 2007; Csóka et al., 2008; Antonioli et al., 2013). 
In this T reg cell–deficient model, inosine’s inhibition of 
Th1/Th2 by A2A shown in vitro (Fig. 5) may have thera-
peutic value in T reg cell deficiency–mediated autoimmu-
nity. We orally fed inosine daily to determine its effects on 
survival of SF mice (Fig. 6 A). We found that SF mice when 
fed inosine had significantly prolonged survival to a maximal 
lifespan of 125 d, compared with 30 d in SF mice without 
inosine treatment (Fig. 6 B). Tissue inflammation was signifi-
cantly decreased by inosine treatment, as measured by mean 
area of lymphocyte infiltration in liver and lung (Fig. 6, C 
and D). Inosine reduced the frequency of IFN-γ–producing 
CD4+ T (Th1) and the frequency of IL-4–producing CD4+ 
T (Th2) cells in the spleen, as well as plasma levels of IFN-γ 
and IL-4 (Fig. 6, E and F).
T
o further determine the in vivo role of adenosine A2A 
receptors, as a mediator of the beneficial effects of inosine, we 
treated SF mice with inosine and A2A receptor–specific antag-
onist SCH58261 for 2 wk (SFIS) and examined the inflam-
matory biomarkers, and compared with the groups of WT 
mice with inosine (WTI) or inosine+SCh58261 (WTIS), 
and SF mice with inosine (SFI), or SCH58261 (SFS) or 
inosine+SCH58621 (SFIS). Our results indicated that in SF 
mice, SCH58261 itself has no effects on inflammation in SF
, 
but SCH58261 reversed the antiinflammatory effects of ino-
sine in liver and lung (Fig. 6, C and D), the percentage of 
Th1 
or Th2 cells in the spleen, as well as plasma cytokine levels of 
IFN-γ and IL-4 (Fig. 6, E and F). Our data thus confirmed 
that the A2A receptor is required for inhibition of inosine on 
autoimmunity in SF mice.
the inhibition of t reg cell deficiency–
associated autoimmunity by L. reuteri–remodeled 
microbiota requires A2A receptors
T
o further explore whether the adenosine A2A receptors 
also play a critical role in beneficial effects of the L. reuteri– 
remodeled microbiota on autoimmunity, we fed SF mice with 
L. reuteri in combination with A2A receptor–specific antago-
nist SCH58261 (Fig. 7 A). We found that the A2A antagonist 
SCH58261 reversed the beneficial effects of L. reuteri–remod-
eled microbiota on autoimmune damage in liver and lung, the 
frequencies of 
Th1 and 
Th2 cells in the spleen, as well as plasma 
cytokine levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 in SF mice (Fig. 7, B and 
E), indicating that the adenosine A2A receptor mediates a sub-
stantial proportion of the protection of L. reuteri–remodeled 
microbiota against autoimmunity in this model.
dIScuSSIon
Functional T reg cells are of critical importance for the es-
tablishment and maintenance of self-tolerance and immune 
homeostasis. T
o control inflammation or allergy, T reg cells 
exert a dominantly negative regulation of other Th subsets 
(Th1/Th2), which are proinflammatory (Rudensky, 2011). 
In the absence or malfunction of T reg cells, T effector cell 
immunity drives inflammation and lethality in humans with 
IPEX syndrome or IPEX-like syndromes, and in Foxp3-de-
ficient SF mice. Clinical management has not been updated 
since 1993 (Hannibal and T
orgerson, 2011). The life expec-
tancy of patients with IPEX syndrome without hematopoi-
etic stem cell transplant rarely extends beyond infancy. This 
study aimed to define new therapeutic strategies by targeting 
microbiota to T reg cell deficiency–induced autoimmunity.
The gut microbiota is not only essential for the devel-
opment and maturation of the immune system, but also is 
shaped by the complex host immune system. A critical role 
for T reg cell–mediated control of inflammation has been 
studied by using germ-free (GF) mice compared with spe-
cific pathogen–free (SPF) mice (Chinen et al., 2010). Their 
study demonstrated that T reg cell development and suppres-
sive function showed little dependence on gut microbiota. 
However, in a T reg cell–depleted model (Foxp3-DTR), in-
flammation in the small intestine of SPF mice was more se-
vere than in GF mice, as shown by significantly increased gut 
lymphocyte infiltration, decreased body weight, and increased 
% of IFN-γ–producing T helper cells, indicating that T reg 
cell deficiency–induced inflammation is related to gut mi-
crobiota (Chinen et al., 2010). Reduced diversity of gut mi-
crobiota has been shown in immunodeficient mice including 
mice lacking both B and T cells (Rag1−/−) and in mice lack-
ing B cells only (Ighm−/−) or T cells only (Cd3e−/−; Kawa-
 115

moto et al., 2014). Indeed, our results also showed reduced 
gut microbial diversity and altered bacterial composition in T 
reg cell–deficient SF mice, compared with WT mice. It was 
noted that the microbiota in SF mice could be shifted by oral 
administration of L. reuteri to produce a distinct signature 
without reversion to that seen in WT mice. The mechanisms 
by which L. reuteri regulates the intestinal microbiota may be 
multifactorial, including observations that L. reuteri produces 
antimicrobial agents (e.g., reuterin) and other metabolites that 
suppress the growth of other microorganisms (Spinler et al., 
2008); L. reuteri also competes for receptors and binding sites 
with other intestinal microbes on the intestinal mucosa (Col-

lado et al., 2007). The gut microbiota drives host immune 
homeostasis by regulating the differentiation and expansion 
of T cells (Hooper et al., 2012). We found that the develop-
ment of 
Th1/Th2-drived autoimmunity was accompanied by 
microbial dysbiosis over the lifespan of SF mice. When this 
gut microbial dysbiosis was remodeled by L. reuteri, the au-
toimmunity was inhibited, as indicated by prolonged survival, 
reduced multiorgan inflammation, and decreased Th1/Th2 
cytokines in SF mice. We have previously observed the same 
effects of L. reuteri in the setting of experimental necrotizing 
enterocolitis (Liu et al., 2012, 2013).
Metabolites produced by bacteria promote or suppress 
immune cell functions (Roelofsen et al., 2010; Arpaia et al., 
2013; Furusawa et al., 2013). Microbiota-modulated metab-
olites accompanying the introduction of L. reuteri into T 
reg cell–deficient mice may play a critical role in regulating 
immune responses. We discovered that the purine metabolite 
inosine is reduced in plasma by T reg cell deficiency and is 
completely restored by L. reuteri treatment. L. reuteri does 
not generate large amounts of purine/inosine in culture (un-
published data). Based on the evidence of recovery of plasma 
levels of inosine to the levels similar to WT, in association 
with decreased levels in stool of SF mice, we postulate that L. 
reuteri may promote inosine absorption in the intestine by 
improving overall gut health through multiple mechanisms 
(for example by improving villus length) and/or by modu-
lating the gut microbial community. As shown, we measured 
the small intestinal villi in SF mice compared with SF mice 
after oral feeding and showed that orally feeding L. reuteri 
improves the length of villi and depth of crypts. 
The increased 
expression of ENT transporters after L. reuteri feeding would 
also be predicted to correlate with improved absorption.
In addition, the complete genome of L. reuteri contains 
the tRNA-specific adenosine deaminase gene (tadA), which

is involved in the biological process of tRNA wobble ade-
nosine-to-inosine editing (UniProt accession no. F8DLR1), 
and the gene LPX 
TG-motif cell wall anchor domain protein 
(HMP 
REF0538_20056) that belongs to 5′-nucleotidase fam-
ily which could participate in the conversion of inosine mo-
nophosphate into inosine (UniProt accession no. F8DRN6). 
Therefore, we could not rule out that the gut environment 
activates these enzymatic functions to help generate more 
inosine to be absorbed (Muzny et al., 2011). Identity of enzy-
matic activities related to and direct measurements of inosine 
absorption will be further explored.
Previous studies demonstrated that inosine treat-
ment reduces levels of inflammatory cytokines produced by 
LPS-stimulated macrophages in murine models of endotoxic 
shock (Haskó et al., 2000). Inosine also attenuates the course 
of chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases including type 
I diabetes (Mabley et al., 2003b) and experimental colitis 
(Mabley et al., 2003a; Rahimian et al., 2010), in association 
with a reduction of the production of proinflammatory cyto-
kines and chemokines. Recently, investigators demonstrated 
antiinflammatory effects of inosine in mouse models of pleu-
risy (da Rocha Lapa et al., 2012) and allergic lung inflamma-
tion (da Rocha Lapa et al., 2013). Our results confirm that 
inosine is sufficient to inhibit Th1/Th2 differentiation in 
vitro and autoimmunity in vivo by reducing Th1/Th2 cells 
and the associated cytokines in SF mice.
However, mechanisms of the immunomodulatory ef-
fects of inosine are poorly understood. 
We herein demonstrate 
that the inhibition of Th1/Th2 differentiation by inosine re-
quires A2A receptors. Mechanistically, the key to T reg cell 
suppression of T effector cells is the interaction between ade-
nosine produced by T reg cells (mediated by a CD39–CD73 
pathway) and the A2A receptor (expressed on T effector cells; 
Antonioli et al., 2013). It has been reported that lymphocytes 
predominately express A2A receptors (Gomez and Sitkovsky, 
2003). However, during T reg cell deficiency in SF mice or 
human IPEX syndrome, T effector cells lose regulation by 
adenosine-A2A mediated signaling. Our findings highlight the 
possibility that inosine or other A2A agonists could be used 
therapeutically to control T effector cell-mediated autoim-
munity during T reg cell deficiency conditions.
Fredholm et al. (2001) reported that adenosine is the 
natural ligand at all four adenosine receptors. However, ino-
sine was a potent agonist for A1 and A3 receptors, but not 
for A2 receptors. This group used in vitro techniques with 
CHO cells stably transfected with the human A1, A2A, A2B, 
and A3 receptors. 
The inosine concentrations they tested were 
between 0.03 and 30 µM. Jin et al. (1997) concluded that 
physiologically significant concentrations (10–50 µM) of 
inosine selectively activate A3, but not A2, receptors in mast 
cells. However, several other findings indicate the protective 
effects of inosine are mediated by interaction with adenos-
ine A2A receptors (Gomez and Sitkovsky, 2003; Mabley et al., 
2008; Rahimian et al., 2010; da Rocha Lapa et al., 2012, 2013; 
Muto et al., 2014). Welihinda et al. (2016) recently reported 
that inosine is a functional agonist of the A2A receptor. They 
aimed to solve why the immunomodulatory effects of inosine 
in vivo, which at least in part, are mediated via A2A, seem to 
differ from levels needed for in vitro pharmacological effects 
at the A2A receptor. 
The research group used a combination of 
label-free, cell-based, and membrane-based functional assays 
in conjunction with an equilibrium agonist-binding assay. It 
provided evidence for inosine engagement of the A2A recep-
tor and subsequent activation of downstream signaling events. 
EC50 values were 12 (4–33) nM for adenosine and 259.9 
(104–651) µM for inosine.
Compared with adenosine, inosine has a lower affinity 
interaction with the A2A receptor, probably because the struc-
ture of inosine contains fewer hydrogen bonds than adenos-
ine, which are responsible for the binding to agonist-binding 
pocket of A2A receptors (Lebon et al., 2011; Xu et al., 2011; 
Welihinda et al., 2016). Therefore, a high concentration (ap-
proximate millimolar) of inosine was previously required in 
vitro for inosine to inhibit Th1/Th2 differentiation and to 
activate A2A receptors and increase intracellular cAMP levels 
(Welihinda et al., 2016). Previous studies showed that ino-
sine has no capacity to activate A2A or displace the binding 
of a high-affinity agonist to A2A (Fredholm, 1995; Jin et al., 
1997; Fredholm et al., 2001), which may be caused by its 
low affinity for the A2A receptor, to low levels of A2A ex-
pression, or to differential cell types that affect the binding 
between inosine and A2A receptors when studied using in-
sufficient concentrations of inosine for those in vitro experi-
ments. Methods focusing on target identification of bioactive 
small molecules will further provide tools to elucidate the 
molecular details of inosine–A2A interaction (Futamura et al., 
2013; Ziegler et al., 2013).
Our current study focused on the effects of inosine in 
T cells. T cells differ from mast cells, platelets, or macrophages 
in that T cells express A2A as their main adenosine receptor 
(Csóka et al., 2008). A2A knockout mice data strongly suggest 
the effects of inosine are dependent on the A2A receptor on T 
cells. We believe our studies using knockout models provide 
more solid evidence than in vitro studies with A2A antagonists.
We could not rule out that inosine modulates A2A acti-
vation via the salvage pathway in vivo (Kolassa et al., 1977). 
In this pathway, inosine is converted to hypoxanthine, which 
can be converted into inosine 5-monophosphate by hypox-
anthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase, to adenylosucci-
nate, and then to adenosine 5-monophosphate (AMP), finally 
generating adenosine. Adenosine could activate A2A at very 
low concentrations, and then rapidly degrade into inosine 
due to its short biological half-life (∼10 s). Adenosine would 
be rapidly cleared in plasma in vivo (in ∼30 s (Möser et al., 
1989), whereas inosine has a much longer in vivo half-life 
than adenosine (∼15 h; 
Viegas et al., 2000).
In clinical trials in humans, investigators have concluded 
that inosine, when given orally at 3,000 mg per day, was safe 
and well-tolerated (Schwarzschild et al., 2014). The dosages 
of oral inosine used in mouse models varied in different dis-

118
ease models, with the highest dose being 750 mg/kg/bw/day 
(Mabley et al., 2003b; Hou et al., 2007; Muto et al., 2014), 
and toxic effects were not demonstrated. We used a dosage 
of inosine of 800 mg/kg/day for our survival study because 
the phenotype and manifestations of IPEX in SF mice were 
severe. Drug dosages used in mouse studies can be translated 
into human dosages based on surface area (Reagan-Shaw et 
al., 2008); accordingly, the dosage of 800 mg/kg/bw/day used 
in mice would be approximately equivalent to 65 mg/kg/bw/
day in humans. Our dosage is thus much lower than the dos-
age in the aforementioned safety clinical trial (Schwarzschild 
et al., 2014). Moreover, the inosine plasma level in SF mice is 
significantly lower than its level in 
WT mice, according to our 
plasma metabolomics analysis.
In conclusion, our work reveals that microbial dys-
biosis may be implicated in the pathogenesis of T reg cell 
deficiency–induced autoimmunity and that microbiota re-
modeling greatly influences outcome in autoimmune diseases 
via inosine–A2A receptor signaling, and we have summarized 
our findings in Fig. 8. Even though the data do not formally 
rule out noninosine-dependent effects of L. reuteri in sup-
pressing inflammation in SF mice, this study may broaden 
the concept of how immunodeficiency diseases evolve during 
early development, with key contributions by the microbi-
ota and their metabolites acting through receptors on im-
mune cells. This proof-of-principle study will spur future 
application of probiotic L. reuteri, inosine, and A2A receptor 
agonists in other autoimmune diseases, such as IPEX syn-
drome, many of which are linked to inborn immune de-
fects (Uhlig et al., 2014).

B6.Cg-Foxp3sf/Y were generated by breeding heterozygous 
B6.Cg-Foxp3sf/J female to C57BL/6J male mice. Because 
the Foxp3 gene is on the X chromosome, in each litter of 
breeding pairs, all males are either SF used as the experi-
ments or WT littermates as the controls. Adenosine receptor– 
deficient mice with B6 background, including A1

periments are indicated in the figures and figure legends. All 
mice were housed in animal facility at UT Health. All exper-
imental procedures were approved by the IAC 
UC (proto-
col number: AWC-14-056).
L. reuteri preparation and treatment of SF mice
Human breast milk–derived Lactobacillus reuteri DSM17938 
(L. reuteri) was provided by BioGaia AB. Lactobacillus aci-
dophilus DDS (La DDS) was provided by D.R. Mack (Chil-
dren’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ontario, Canada). L. reuteri 
was prepared as previously described (Liu et al., 2014). In brief, 
L. reuteri was anaerobic cultured in deMan-Rogosa-Sharpe 
(MRS) medium at 37°C for 24 h, and then plated in MRS 
agar at specific serial dilution and grown anaerobically at 37°C 
for 48–72 h. Quantitative analysis of bacteria in culture media 
was performed by comparing absorbance at 600 nm of cultures 
at known concentrations, using a standard curve of bacterial 
CFU/ml grown on MRS agar. Each male mouse was given 
either MRS as control, or L. reuteri (WTL or SFL) or La DDS 
(WTD 
DS or SFD 
DS) in cultured media (107 CFU/day) by ga-
vage, daily, starting from 8 d of age (d8; early treatment) or d15 
(late treatment), until the date as indicated in Fig. 3 A and Fig. 
S2 
A, respectively. For treatment with L. reuteri in combination 
with A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261 (Sigma-Aldrich) to 
examine the immunological biomarkers, each SF mouse was 
orally administered 107 CFU of L. reuteri and i.p. injected 2 
mg/kg of SCH58261 daily (SFLS) or was i.p. injected 2 mg/
kg of SCH58261 daily (SFS) from d8 to the date as indicated 
in Fig. 3 A, Fig. S2 A, and Fig. 7 A, respectively.
Inosine preparation and treatment of SF mice
Inosine (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sterilized water at 
the concentration of 40 mg/ml. For determining the effect 
of inosine on autoimmunity in SF mice, 800 mg/kg of ino-
sine per day was orally administered to WT (WTI), SF mice 
(SFI) from d8 until the date as indicated in Fig. 6 A. For 
treatment with inosine in the combination with SCH58261 
to examine the immunological biomarkers, WT (WTIS) SF 
(SFIS) mice were orally administered 800 mg/kg of inosine 
and 2 mg/kg of SCH58261 i.p. once daily from d8 to the date 
as indicated in Fig. 6 A.
Histopathology
All tissues were fixed and processed by the Cellular and Molec-
ular Morphology Core Lab (T
exas Medical Center Digestive 
Diseases Center, Houston, TX) and stained with hematoxylin 
and eosin (H&E) for histological evaluation. The area of lym-
phocyte infiltration of liver and lung and the villus height and 
crypt depth of small intestine were measured using ImageJ 
(National Institutes of Health) morphometry software.
In vitro tissue preparation and stimulation for 
flow cytometry analysis
Single-cell suspensions from the spleen and MLNs were ob-
tained by gently fragmenting and filtering the tissues through 
40-µm cell strainers (BD) into MACS buffer consisting of PBS, 
0.5% BSA (Hyclone Laboratories), and 2 mM EDTA (Lonza). 
For in vitro stimulation, cells were stimulated with PMA (50 
ng/ml) and ionomycin (1 µg/ml) in the presence of Brefeldin 
A (5 µ/ml) for 4 h to analyze IFN-γ–producing (Th1) and 
IL-4–producing (Th2) CD4+ T cells by flow cytometry.
naive cd4+ t cell isolation and in vitro 
differentiation to th1 and th2
Naive CD4+ T cells were isolated from the spleens of 
6–8-wk-old C57BL/6J or adenosine receptor knockout mice 
by magnetic cell sorting, using a naive CD4+ T cell isolation 
kit (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec). For Th1 differentiation, naive T 
cells (5 × 105 cells/well) were plated in 24-well plates con-
taining 1 µg/ml anti-CD3, 2 µg/ml anti-CD28, 20 ng/ml 
IL-2, 10 µg/ml anti–IL-4–neutralizing antibody, and 20 ng/
ml recombinant mouse IL-12 in RPMI-1640 complete me-
dium at 37°C for 5 d with or without 2 mM of inosine. For 
Th2 differentiation, naive T cells were cultured in the pres-
ence of 1 µg/ml anti-CD3, 2 µg/ml anti-CD28, 20 ng/ml 
IL-2, 10 µg/ml anti–IFN-γ neutralizing antibody and 10 ng/
ml recombinant mouse IL-4 in RPMI-1640 complete me-
dium at 37°C for 5 d with or without 2 mM of inosine. At 
day 5, the cells were stimulated with PMA and ionomycin 
in the presence of Brefeldin A. The detailed antibodies and 
cytokines used are listed in Table S3.
Staining cells for flow cytometry analysis
For evaluation of the purity of naive CD4+ T cells, after 
sorting, cells were stained using fluorescein-labeled CD44, 
CD45RB, CD4, and CD62L. For characterization of 
Th1 and 
Th2 cells, cells were surface-stained by fluorescein labeled–
CD4 and intracellularly stained with IFN-γ for Th1 and IL-4 
for Th2. Intracellular staining was performed with a fixation/
permeabilization kit, according to the manufacturer’s proto-
col (eBioscience). 
The data from all samples were acquired on 
FAC 
SCalibur (BD) and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree 
Star). The detailed antibodies used are listed in Table S3.

cAMP assay
Differentiated Th1 or Th2 cells from naive CD4+ T cells iso-
lated from WT and adenosine A2A receptor knockout mice 
were seeded (104 cells/well) into 96-well plates. Cells were 
incubated in the absence or presence of inosine (2 mM) or 
adenosine A2A receptor agonist CGS21680 (300 nM) at 37°C. 
The cAMP levels in Th1 and Th2 cells were measured by 
cAMP-Glo assay kit (Promega) after treatment for 15 min.
Plasma cytokine assays
Plasma cytokine levels of IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-2, IL-1β, and IL-10 
were assessed using a mouse multi-spot proinflammatory 
panel kit from Meso Scale Discovery (MSD), according to 
the manufacturer’s protocol.
Stool microbial community analysis
Feces from cecum to rectum of mice were collected. Stool 
DNA was extracted by using Quick Stool DNA Isolation kit 
(QIA 
GEN). 
The composition of the stool microbiota was ana-
lyzed using high-throughput sequencing analysis of PCR-am-
plified 16s rRNA genes as previous described (Gupta et al., 
2013). Bacterial diversity, species composition, and abundance 
were assessed using QII 
ME (Caporaso et al., 2010).
Plasma and stool metabolomic analysis
Plasma and stool metabolites were measured by Metabolon 
Inc. A total of 657 metabolites in stool and 525 metabolites in 
plasma were detected by a nontargeted metabolomic analy 
sis 
platform, including UPLC-MS/MS and GC/MS, respectively. 
The metabolomic data were analyzed by pattern recognition 
analyses (unsupervised principal component analysis and 
Heat-map), revealing the biochemical perturbations induced 
by T reg cell deficiency or L. reuteri treatment, as previously 
described (He et al., 2015).
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as mean ± SEM. Significance was deter-
mined using one-way ANO 
VA corrected for multiple com-
parisons with Tukey and Dunnett’s posttests, or two-way 
ANO 
VA for multiple comparisons with a Bonferroni test. 
Kaplan-Meier survival curves were graphed, and the compar-
ison was analyzed using Logrank with χ2 test. The statistical 
analysis was performed using Prism version 4.0 (GraphPad 
Software). Differences were noted as significant at P < 0.05.
online supplemental material
Fig. S1 shows the dynamic changes of autoimmunity and 
gut microbiota over 22 d of life in SF mice. Fig. S2 shows 
that L. reuteri late treatment prolongs survival, inhibits au-
toimmunity, and modulates gut microbiota in SF mice, but 
L. acidophilus DDS does not. Fig. S3 shows that L. reuteri 
early treatment reprograms fecal metabolomic profiles in SF 
mice. Fig. S4 shows that L. reuteri early treatment improves 
villus height and decreases crypt depth, and increases the ex-
pression of nucleoside transporters in small intestine of SF 
mice. Fig. S5 shows that inosine does not inhibit the prolif-
eration of B and T cells or change the expression of adenos-
ine receptors in Th1/Th2 cells. Table S1 shows 525 plasma 
metabolites and their relative quantification in WT, SF
, and 
SF with L. reuteri treatment (SFL) mice. Table S2 shows 657 
fecal metabolites and their relative quantification in WT, SF 
and SF with L. reuteri early treatment (SFL) mice. Table S3 
lists antibodies and cytokines used in the study. Table S4 lists 
sequences of qPCR primers used in the study. Tables S1–S4 
are available as Excel files.
