Oral anticoagulant therapy for venous
thromboembolism is very effective. When
oral anticoagulants are managed well, the
risk of recurrence is approximately 2 per
100 patient-years. The main reasons for
a
breakthrough
event
are
underlying
disease and subtherapeutic drug levels.
The most common underlying disease
that results in recurrence on treatment is
cancer. Subtherapeutic drug levels can be
caused by poor adherence to the drug
regimen, interactions with other drugs or
food, or inappropriate dosing. It is impor-
tant to investigate and understand the
cause whenever such an event occurs and
toimprovemanagementofanticoagulants
thereby avoiding further recurrences. Here
we present 4 illustrative cases together
with a discussion of the underlying pa-
thology. Whereas the mechanisms are
usually quite well understood, the man-
agement of further anticoagulation after a
breakthrough event is based on minimal
or no clinical trial evidence. (Blood. 2017;
129(25):3285-3293)
Introduction
Risk of recurrence in different populations
Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) have a long track record of providing
effective protection against recurrences after venous thromboembolism
(VTE). In a Cochrane meta-analysis of studies comparing shorter
versuslongerdurationoftreatment withVKAs,theriskofrecurrence in
thelongerdurationoftreatmentarmwas1.6%.1Thesestudiesgenerally
excluded patients with known cancer. In 5 randomized trials in patients
with cancer, 82 (14%) of 571 patients treated with VKAs had recurrent
VTEs vs 42 (7.1%) of 591 patients receiving low-molecular-weight
heparin (LMWH) during the first 3 to 6 months of treatment.2
The non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) have
not shown superiority to VKAs regarding efficacy in the treatment of
VTEs. In the treatment of acute VTEs, the relative risk for recurrence
with NOACs vs VKAs was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI],
0.55-1.31).3 On the basis of subgroup analyses from some of these
studies, the corresponding relative risk in patients with cancer was
0.77 (95% CI, 0.44-1.33).4 However, this was mainly in cancers
without metastases and not with LMWH as a comparator. Results from
clinical practice studies also show similar efficacy for rivaroxaban vs
VKAs, rivaroxaban being the only NOAC that has been approved for a
long enough time to allow for such observations. Thus, in the interna-
tional Xarelto for Long-Term and Initial Anticoagulation in Venous
Thromboembolism (XALIA) cohort study, the adjusted hazard ratio
for VTE recurrence with rivaroxaban vs VKAs was 0.91 (95% CI,
0.54-1.54)5 and in the Swiss Venous Thromboembolism Registry
(SWIVTER), it was 0.55 (95% CI, 0.18-1.65).6
New symptoms of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism
are not proof of recurrent events, even when there seems to be support
from diagnostic imaging. In the RE-COVER study7 comparing
dabigatran with warfarin for the treatment of acute VTE, all patients
atbaselinehad ultrasonographyofbothlegsandcomputedtomography
(CT) or ventilation-perfusion scanning of the lungs whether they had
symptoms or not. Central adjudication of locally suspected recurrences
on diagnostic imaging, using comparisons with baseline data, did not
confirm suspected recurrent pulmonary embolism in 7.5% and did not
confirm suspected recurrent deep vein thrombosis in 11.8% (un-
published data). Ipsilateral recurrence of thrombosis poses a special
diagnostic challenge. When there is a questionable difference in
extension of the VTE between the images from the first event and the
recurrence, a negative D-dimer in a patient with onset of symptoms
within the last few days speaks against a true recurrence.
Patients admitted to the hospital with a new diagnosis of pulmonary
embolism while already receiving warfarin compared with those
admitted with pulmonary embolism who are not receiving anti-
coagulation, have a 4.4-fold higher risk of fatal recurrent pulmonary
embolism after discharge from the hospital.8 These deaths are mainly
related to cardiovascular disease, malignancy, and sepsis.
Causes for breakthrough thromboembolism
Underlying condition or disease.
There are many potential causes
for recurrence of VTE despite anticoagulant therapy. From the above-
mentioned trial data, it is obvious that presence of cancer increases the
risk of recurrence. In the largest registry of VTE treatment in clinical
practice, Registro Informatizado de la Enfermedad Trombo Embolica
(RIETE), every third patient with recurrence who was receiving VKA
therapy had cancer.9 This is the cardinal example of an underlying
disease exhibiting pronounced thrombogenicity that overcomes
the protective effect of anticoagulants. The malignant tumors exert
this effect through several mechanisms that, among others, involve
activation of coagulation and obstruction of blood flow and have been
extensively reviewed elsewhere.10 For patients with myeloproliferative
neoplasms (polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia),
molecular profiling with analysis of JAK2, CALR, and MPL mutations
can add information on the risk of thrombosis that often occurs
in atypical sites.11 Diseases or conditions with an increased risk of
recurrent VTE on anticoagulation are summarized in Table 1. The
mechanism behind the increased thrombogenicity is sometimes
unclear, such as in Behçet disease and antiphospholipid syndrome,

From 
 and many alternatives have been proposed (Table 1). However,
for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, the pathogenesis has been
explained: immunoglobulin G antibodies that recognize the multimo-
lecular complexes between heparin and platelet factor 4 assemble on
the surface of platelets that become activated and release procoagulant
microparticles.12
A minority of patients with antiphospholipid syndrome display a
falsely elevated international normalized ratio (INR), possibly because
of antibodies against tissue factor, and they may thus have recurrent
events despite optimal INRs.13 They would typically have demon-
strated a prolonged prothrombin time before starting treatment with an
anticoagulant, and alternative thromboplastins that are insensitive to
the lupus anticoagulant should then be used for monitoring warfarin
therapy.14 INR results from point-of-care instruments are variable and
not reliable for patients with lupus anticoagulant.
Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, diagnosed in 1 per 100 000
people per year15 and caused by the expansion of an abnormal hema-
topoietic clone, is characterized by intravascular hemolysis, cytopenias,
and thrombosis. The latter often occur in unusual sites (intra-abdominal
or intracranial veins), and treatment failures in patients receiving
anticoagulant therapy have been reported at 10.6 events per 100 patient-
years.16 In 1 study, 9 of 41 patients with thrombosis experienced re-
currences when receiving anticoagulants.17 A concomitant bleeding
tendency often makes it difficult to increase the anticoagulant
intensity,andtargetingoftheterminalcomplementactivationcomplex
by the addition of eculizumab is probably the best solution.18,19
During pregnancy, many changes occur in the prohemostatic
direction, essentially preparing the woman for childbirth without
massive bleeding but with a concomitant increase in risk of thrombosis
(Table 1). Furthermore, the presence of the antiphospholipid syndrome
willincrease theriskofgestationalvenousthromboembolismaswellas
unexplained fetal death, spontaneous abortions, and premature birth.20
In the RIETE registry with 607 women experiencing VTEs during
pregnancy or puerperium, 16 had a recurrence and 11 of those occurred
during treatment with anticoagulants.21 However, only1 of the patients
with recurrence who was receiving anticoagulation had antiphospho-
lipid syndrome.
Thrombophilia, other than antiphospholipid syndrome, is some-
times found in patients with breakthrough events, but there is no
convincing evidence that such events are more common in patients
with hereditary thrombophilic defects.22 It has been speculated that
deficiency of antithrombin may be associated with heparin resistance.
In a retrospective review of 70 patients with congenital antithrombin
deficiency, we found 8 patients in whom there was some clinical
deterioration on treatment with unfractionated heparin.23
Finally, vascular anomalies with chronic obstruction of the
venous flow may cause recurrences while the patient (typically
young patients) is receiving anticoagulation. These abnormalities
include the thoracic outlet syndrome and May-Thurner syndrome
(compression of the left common iliac vein by the right iliac artery).24
There are several options for managing these thrombotic events,
including initial thrombolysis, pharmacomechanical clot removal,
endovascular stenting, or decompressive surgery (thoracic outlet
syndrome).25
Inappropriate dosing of anticoagulant.
For patients treated with
VKAs, it is crucial to remember that it takes at least 5 days for all the
vitamin K–dependent coagulation factors to decrease to sufficiently low
activity to provide a therapeutic anticoagulant effect. Therefore, overlap
with a parenteral anticoagulant for at least 5 days and until the INR has
reached 2.0 for at least 24 hours is recommended (Grade 1B, explained
in Table 2).26
It may take 4 to 6 weeks until treatment witha VKA results instable
therapeutic INRs (ie, maintaining the range of 2.0-3.0). Many patients
will have 1 or several subtherapeutic INRs during this first treatment
phase, which could explain the frontloaded trend to superior efficacy of
NOACs seen in the studies with rivaroxaban in deep vein thrombosis27
and with apixaban in VTE.28
Patients receiving anticoagulation therapy with VKAs and the
physicians managing them need to be aware of the large number of
drug-drug interactions that can affect the INR levels and that require
dose adjustments. This often becomes demanding when patients start
treatment with an interacting drug that has a slow, progressive
interaction that requires repeated dose adjustments over weeks or even
months. An example of this is rifampicin, which causes a delayed
induction of the microsomal enzyme CYP2C9, which is responsi-
ble for most of the metabolism of warfarin.29 A reverse example
is amiodarone, a general inhibitor of cytochrome P450–catalyzed
oxidation, thereby decreasing the effect of CYP2C9.30 When amiodar-
one is discontinued, there is a delayed increase in dose requirements to
maintain therapeutic warfarin effect. In both cases, frequent monitoring
of anticoagulation during several months is required to avoid suboptimal
dosing and recurrent VTE.
The importance of drug-food interactions with VKAs involving the
vitamin K–rich dark green vegetables has often been exaggerated to
the extent that some patients stopped eating any vegetables when
taking warfarin.Patients should be encouragedtomaintain aconsistent,
healthy diet. However, if the patient decides to embark on a vegetarian
diet, there might be a need to increase the dose of VKAs. Avocado was
reported to antagonize warfarin, perhaps more from the oil inhibiting
warfarin absorption than via vitamin K.31
The NOACs definitely have fewer drug-drug interactions than
VKAs. Concomitant use of rifampicin, phenytoin, carbamazepine,
St. John’s wort, and possibly phenobarbital will cause strong induction
of CYP3A4. This leads to a decrease of the area under the curve (ie,
exposureby 50% ormorefor rivaroxaban and apixaban, as described in
the respective product monographs). Edoxaban is much less dependent
on CYP3A4 metabolism, but it is a substrate for the P-glycoprotein
(P-gp) efflux transporter like all other NOACs, and rifampicin will

 cause a 33% increase in the clearance of edoxaban.32 Dabigatran is not

orP-gpinducersisthereforenotrecommendedwithanyoftheNOACs.
Thus, one of the above-mentioned interactions could be the expla-
nation for a VTE recurrence when a patient is receiving anticoagulation
therapy with a NOAC, and the current medication list should be care-
fully reviewed before prescribing an alternative oral anticoagulant
or intensifying current anticoagulation therapy. For rivaroxaban, there is
anadditionalcaveat.Atthe15-to20-mgdosesusedfortreatmentofVTE
(as opposed to a 10-mg dose used for VTE prophylaxis), rivaroxaban
depends on the presence of food for optimal intestinal absorption, as
already reported from studies in healthy volunteers.33 Exposure to
rivaroxaban taken without food might be even lower in patients than in
healthy volunteers, as described in a patient with recurrent pulmonary
embolism who was receiving rivaroxaban.34 In my clinical practice,
I have identified several patients with recurrent VTE or cardioembolic
stroke under the same circumstances.
Another scenario with suboptimal exposure is the morbidly obese
patient.TherearenorecommendationsfordoseadjustmentsofNOACs
for this population, which was underrepresented in the clinical trials.
Patients with major gastrointestinal tract surgery might have
reduced absorption of a NOAC. In a review of the literature, only
case series or single case reports were identified.35 It seemed that
reduced anticoagulant efficacy could be experienced with dabigatran,
and possibly also with rivaroxaban after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or
after gastrectomy. There was no information regarding the absorption
of apixaban or edoxaban in such patients.
In the setting of stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation, it has been
shown that patients are more stroke averse than physicians but
physicians are more bleeding averse than patients, which leads to
underdosing.36 The NOACs are typically labeled for a standard dose
and a reduced dose regimen, according to specific criteria for stroke
prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation and in some countries for VTE.
Retrospective medical record reviews have shown a high degree of
inappropriate dose selection, even in hospitals,37,38 with many of those
patients receiving a suboptimal dose. This may also be true for the
patients with VTE and is thus another explanation for breakthrough
events.TheapproveddoseregimensfortreatmentofVTEwithNOACs
differ somewhat between the United States and other countries. For
example, dabigatran is only approved at a dose of 150 mg twice per day
in the United States; in other countries, the drug label has a dose
reduction to 110 mg twice per day for patients older than age 80 years
or older than age 75 years if they have an increased risk of bleeding.
This dose reduction is not based on data from the studies of treatment
in VTE, and only observational studies will confirm if this dose is
sufficiently effective.39 There are also criteria based on low body
weight, impaired renal function, and/or older age for reduction of
the dose of rivaroxaban or apixaban in patients with atrial fibrillation
but not in patients with VTE, which is bound to result in confusion.
Conversely, for edoxaban, the dose reduction is recommended for both
indications for patients with moderate renal impairment, low body
weight, and/or concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors (Table 3).
Evaluation and investigation of the patient
A suggested algorithm for evaluating the cause for recurrent VTE in a
patient who is receiving anticoagulation therapy is shown in Figure 1.
Rare causes for breakthrough events may have been missed. Further
details regarding evaluation and management will be discussed in
association with the case examples below. The reason for the
therapeutic failure may not be apparent at the first encounter with the
patient. Although investigations are continuing, the most appropriate
andeffectiveanticoagulanttherapyshouldbeprovided.Ifamalignancy
is highly suspected but not yet proven, it would be appropriate to treat
according to that hypothesis (see Case 1). In general, LMWH at a
therapeutic dose, or sometimes higher, is a good option unless heparin-
induced thrombocytopenia is a possibility.
Some investigations are not feasible or are fraught with mis-
interpretation for patients who are receiving anticoagulant treatment.
For example, the antithrombin level is reduced during treatment with
heparin. Lupus anticoagulant testing may become false positive on any
anticoagulant treatment, but it is not advisable to hold treatment to
obtain this test in view of the very hypercoagulable state of the patient.

with LMWH. His INR is now 2.9 and has been in the therapeutic range
most of the time. The patient also complains of upper abdominal pain
and poor appetite and has lost about 5 kg since the last visit.
Initial investigation and anticoagulation
We suspected a malignancy and ordered a CT scan of the abdomen and
pelvis. In the SOMIT study, this was the investigation with the highest
yield in the group allocated to extensive screening for cancer.40 While
awaiting the CT result, we stopped warfarin and started LMWH at a
therapeutic dose. The CT scan demonstrated cancer of the pancreas
with liver metastases.Therefore, the patient will continue on LMWH at
a therapeutic dose rather than going back to an oral anticoagulant for
now. This is in accordance with the recommendations by guidelines

From 
 Anticoagulation FORUM,43 and an informal suggestion from the
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO).44 The recom-
mendations or suggestions are based on the superior efficacy of
LMWH compared with VKAs in patients with cancer and mainly a
first event of VTE. An ISTH registry of patients with cancer and
recurrent VTE who were receiving anticoagulation therapy
confirmed that these patients also experienced fewer recurrences
over the next 3 months on LMWH vs warfarin (hazard ratio, 0.28;
95% CI, 0.11-0.70).45 Nevertheless, additional recurrences in patients
receiving anticoagulation are not uncommon: 11% during 3 months in
the ISTH registry.45
Beyond the acute phase
The CLOT study used a protocol with the LMWH dalteparin at full
therapeutic dose for 1 month, followed by 75% of the dose for the next
2 to 5 months.46 In the CATCH study, patients in the LMWH arm
received tinzaparin at full therapeutic dose for the entire 6 months.47
The guideline and guidance documents do not provide any suggestions
regarding dose reduction after a certain number of months.41,42,44 This
hasleftmetochoosebetweenmaintainingthedoseat100%orreducing
the dose to 75% after 1 month, depending on the perceived risk of
recurrence (thrombogenic tumor type, extensive thromboembolism)
and risk of bleeding.
For patientswithacalculatedcreatinineclearancebelow30mL/min,
corresponding to severe renal impairment, the dose of enoxaparin
should be reduced to 1 mg/kg once per day. The product monographs
for dalteparin and tinzaparin recommend that for patients with severe
renal impairment, a dose reduction should be considered, but they do
not specify how much the dose should be reduced. Nadroparin is
contraindicated in severe renal impairment.
Recurrent VTE in patients receiving a therapeutic dose
of LMWH
In a retrospective study of patients with cancer and with recurrent VTE
who were receiving anticoagulation therapy, 47 patients who were
already receiving treatment witha therapeutic dose of LMWHhad dose
escalationof20% to25%for4weeks.48Somepatientswere receivinga
prophylactic dose and others were receiving a therapeutic dose of
LMWH when the breakthrough event happened. Only the latter subset
of patients was escalated to a supratherapeutic LMWH dose of about
120%.Therecurrenceratebeyondthisdoseescalationwas8.6%during
3 months, with 3 patients each receiving a therapeutic dose or 120% of
the therapeutic dose.48 In the international ISTH registry, there was no
significant difference in the risk of further recurrences over 3 months
between patients who had a dose escalation of $20% (or $25%) and
those with an unchanged dose of LMWH.45 The ACCP guidelines
recommend a dose escalation of LMWH by one-quarter to one-third
(Grade 2C),41 and ASCO recommends a 20% to 25% increase (no
grade).44
In clinical practice, it is often difficult to maintain patients on
a twice-per-day injection regimen for prolonged periods. After a
recurrence on enoxaparin at 1.5 mg/kg per day, a patient could
change to either enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice per day or, for patients
who are not overweight, to tinzaparin at slightly more than 200 units/kg
once per day, which might fit into one prefilled syringe. Insertion of
a vena cava filter is not recommended for these patients unless
there is a contraindication to anticoagulation or if there is recur-
rent pulmonary embolism when the patient is receiving adequate
anticoagulation.42
The NOACs are not yet recommended for initial treatment in the
absence of any study comparing such a drug head-to-head with
LMWH. In the near future, results are expected from such a study
comparing edoxaban with LMWH,49 and another study comparing
apixaban with LMWH (NCT03045406).After the first 3 to 6 months of
treatment, patients who still have active cancer continue to have a high
risk of recurrent VTE. It is unlikely that we will see a study comparing
different anticoagulants for this extended phase.50 Here, NOACs are
a valid option in view of the data from a meta-analysis of subgroups
from the phase 3 trials with NOACs,4 but VKAs or, for patients who
still tolerate it, LMWH is another option. Treatment suggestions for
recurrent VTEs in patients with cancer who are receiving anti-
coagulation therapy are summarized in Figure 2. Decisions on dose
reductions should take into account the risk of bleeding and renal
function.

From 
 Case 2: antiphospholipid syndrome
A 33-year-old woman is seen in the emergency room for acute
shortness of breath and fatigue. She has a history of recurrent
spontaneous abortions, and investigation has demonstrated that she
is positive for lupus anticoagulant and antibodies against cardiolipin.
She has recently had a successful pregnancy, managed with LMWH
and aspirin throughout and until 6 weeks postpartum. At 3 months
postpartum, she developed deep vein thrombosis in the right leg and
was treated initially with LMWH, overlapping to warfarin. The patient
has continued breastfeeding the baby. She is now 5 months postpartum
and her INRs have been difficult to maintain between 2.0 and 3.0,
now being 1.6, a typical finding in patients with the antiphospholipid
syndrome.51 Ventilation-perfusion lung scanning demonstrated bi-
lateral segmental defects on the perfusion but not on the ventilation
scan; thus, there is a high probability for pulmonary embolism.
Treatment should now be switched back to LMWH at a therapeutic
dose for 1 week. Once the symptoms have abated, the dose can be
reduced to a prophylactic level (eg, dalteparin 5000-7500 IU once per
day or enoxaparin 40-60 mg once per day. In a systematic review, long-
term anticoagulation with LMWH was similarly effective and had a
lower risk of bleeding than a VKA.52 Although several of the 15
included studies used a therapeutic dose of LMWH in the long term,
there were similar results for efficacy after pooling the 6 studies with
a prophylactic dose: odds ratio for recurrent VTE of 0.91 (95% CI,
0.50-1.60) for LMWH vs VKA. In a case series of 24 patients with
antiphospholipid syndrome and thrombosis, long-term secondary
prophylaxis was given with dalteparin 5000 units per day for a mean
of 309 days, and only 1 treatment failure was reported.53 For patients
like the one in this example with a recurrence on VKA, I would give
the higher prophylactic dose, that is, dalteparin 7500 IU or enoxaparin
60 mg per day over the long term.
One of the NOACs could be a more convenient alternative for this
patient once she stops breastfeeding, and there are emerging data from
case series54 and subgroup analyses from larger trials22 that NOACs
are similarly effective in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome.
However, until a current randomized trial has demonstrated efficacy
results,55 NOACs should not be the first line of treatment because

¸et disease
A 39-year-old man, an immigrant from Syria, was diagnosed with deep
vein thrombosis in the popliteal vein of the right leg 2 months ago.
It was apparently unprovoked, and he was initially treated with LMWH
overlapping with warfarin. During the last month, his INRs have been
between 2.0 and 3.0. He now has more pain in the right thigh and
the calf is more swollen. Ultrasonography confirms progression of the
thrombus up to the mid-femoral vein. He has not lost any weight, has a
good appetite, and has normal bowel function. Five years ago, in his
homecountry,he hadsomekind ofinflammationin1eye.Upon further
questioning, he admits to having had some ulcers in his mouth that he
thought were cold sores. On physical examination, there are no current
mouth sores or genital sores but there is acne. Visual acuity is decreased
in the eye that had the inflammation.
Behçet disease is suspected because the patient seems to fulfill the
obligatory criterion of mouth sores and 2 of the additional 4 signs
required(possibleuveitisandacnebut notgenitalsoresandnopathergy
test yet). The pathology of venous thrombosis in Behçet disease is
mainly attributed to inflammation of the vessel wall, and the thrombi
become very adherent with a low risk for pulmonary embolism.58
Anticoagulants have not provided good protection against recurrences
in reported cases.59 In the 2008 recommendations of the European
League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) for management of Behçet
disease, anticoagulation received the weakest strength of recommen-
dation (D) based on the lowest level of evidence (IV).58 Instead,
immunosuppressive agents are recommended (Table 4). The mono-
clonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor a, infliximab, has more
recently been used with success in some patients with venous

 thrombosis.60,61 I have used colchicine with good effect in a patient with
anticoagulant-refractory deep vein thrombosis, and similar experiences
have been published.62
Case 4: recurrence on treatment with a NOAC
A 42-year-old man was previously healthy until he suffered an
unprovoked deep vein thrombosis in the left leg 4 months ago.
Compression ultrasonography showed lack of compressibility from
the mid-femoral vein to the trifurcation. He began treatment with
rivaroxaban15mgtwiceperday,switchingafter3weekstorivaroxaban
20 mg per day. During the past 4 days, he has experienced increasing
pain in the same leg and has difficulty walking. On physical
examination, the left leg is 3 cm larger than the right at the maximum
calf level and 2 cm larger at the ankle, showing slight reddish
discoloration butnopittingedema.His bodyweightis142 kg.Repeat
ultrasonography shows extension of the thrombosis to the proximal
femoral and the common femoral vein.
The patient has not had any weight loss, and review of systems is
negative. He works as a taxi driver. The patient claims that he is taking
rivaroxaban diligently once per day, and his pharmacy verifies that he
renewed his prescription on the expected date. However, he admits that
he does not always have time to eat breakfast in the morning when
he takes his medication. Thus, we have a patient who seems to be
compliant,buthisbodyweightisattheextremeendofthepopulationin
the clinical trials (14% weighed .100 kg), and the absorption of the
drughasbeensuboptimalpartofthetime.Pharmacokineticresultsfrom
human volunteers showed that the peak concentration of rivaroxaban
wasunaffectedin patients who weighed.120kg,63butonly12patients
had a body weight .100 kg. A guidance document from ISTH on the
use of NOACs for obese patients suggests that these drugs should not
beused for patientswithabody weight.120kg.64It also suggeststhat
if a NOAC is used anyway, drug-specific levels at peak and trough
shouldbe obtained.Pharmacokineticstudies inhealthy volunteers also
showed that the absorption of the 20-mg dose of rivaroxaban taken on
a fasting stomach is 66% of the absorption when rivaroxaban is
taken with food33 and, in patients, the difference might be greater.34
We obtained a rivaroxaban-calibrated drug level 3 hours after the
patient took a dose with food and it was 55 ng/mL, which is quite low.
Thus, it is reasonable to follow the ISTH guidance document64 and
abandon further treatment with a NOAC and continue instead with
warfarin, overlapping initially with LMWH.
Conclusion
Recurrent VTE for patients who are receiving anticoagulation therapy
is not very common, and new symptoms from the leg could be a
manifestation of postthrombotic syndrome. There are several differen-
tialdiagnosesforchestpainorshortnessofbreath.Whenarecurrenceis
confirmed by differences in VTE extent compared with the diagnostic
imagingbeforeanticoagulationtherapywasstarted,thecauseshouldbe
carefully investigated, because the management differs. The first step is
to identify inappropriate anticoagulation therapy (ie, incorrect dose,
poor adherence, or drug interactions that may reduce the anticoagulant
effect). Once any of these have been excluded, the investigation should
be focused on diseases or conditions with hypercoagulability, of which
cancer is the most common. The recommendations regarding contin-
ued management are usually weak because of the low-quality level of
evidence.
