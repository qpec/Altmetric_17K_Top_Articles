AIMS
p-Synephrine is a protoalkaloid widely used in dietary supplements for weight management because of its purported thermogenic
effects. However, there is a lack of scientific information about its effectiveness to increase fat metabolism during exercise. The
purpose of this investigation was to determine the effects of an acute ingestion of p-synephrine on fat oxidation at rest and during
exercise.
METHODS
In a double-blind, randomized and counterbalanced experimental design, 18 healthy subjects performed two acute experimental
trials after the ingestion of p-synephrine (3 mg kg�1) or after the ingestion of a placebo (cellulose). Energy expenditure and fat
oxidation rates were measured by indirect calorimetry at rest and during a cycle ergometer ramp exercise test (increases of 25 W
every 3 min) until volitional fatigue.
RESULTS
In comparison with the placebo, the ingestion of p-synephrine did not change energy consumption (1.6 ± 0.3 vs.
1.6 ± 0.3 kcal min�1; P = 0.69) or fat oxidation rate at rest (0.08 ± 0.02 vs. 0.10 ± 0.04 g min�1; P = 0.15). However, the intake of p-
synephrine moved the fat oxidation–exercise intensity curve upwards during the incremental exercise (P < 0.05) without affecting
energy expenditure. Moreover, p-synephrine increased maximal fat oxidation rate (0.29 ± 0.15 vs. 0.40 ± 0.18 g min�1; P = 0.01)
during exercise although it did not affect the intensity at which maximal fat oxidation was achieved (55.8 ± 7.7 vs. 56.7 ± 8.2%
VO2peak; P = 0.51).
CONCLUSIONS
The acute ingestion of p-synephrine increased the fat oxidation rate while it reduced the carbohydrate oxidation rate when
exercising at low-to-moderate exercise intensities.
WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• p-Synephrine is a phenylethylamine derivative naturally present in bitter orange (Citrus aurantium).
• This substance can also be synthesized in the human body using the same pathways involved in the synthesis of catecholamines.
• p-Synephrine is a substance typically included in weight loss products because it might induce significant increases in basal met-
abolic rate and lipolysis by activation of the β3 adrenergic receptors.

 WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• The ingestion of 3 mg kg�1 of p-synephrine did not change energy consumption or fat oxidation rate at rest.
• Acute consumption of p-synephrine was effective to move the fat oxidation–exercise intensity curve upwards during the
incremental exercise and increased maximal fat oxidation rate during exercise.
• The metabolic effects found after the ingestion of p-synephrine might be valuable for those individuals seeking increased fat
oxidation during exercise.
Introduction
p-Synephrine (4-[1-hydroxy-2-(methylamino)ethyl]phenol)
is a phenylethylamine derivative naturally present in bitter
orange (Citrus aurantium) and many other citrus species such
as Seville oranges, Nova tangerines and Marr’s sweet oranges
[1, 2]. Moreover, p-synephrine can be synthesized in the hu-
man body using the same pathways involved in the synthesis
of catecholamines [3], although it is considered a trace amine
due to its low plasmatic levels. p-Synephrine has become
popular as an alternative to ephedra after the banning of
ephedrine-containing dietary products by the Food and Drug
Administration in 2004 [4]. This substance has been in-
cluded, as p-synephrine or as Citrus aurantium, in a multitude
of foods and dietary supplements used for weight loss because
of its purported thermogenic effect [5].
Previous investigations have demonstrated that acute [6]
and chronic ingestions [7] of Citrus aurantium supplements
– containing p-synephrine among other sympathomimetic
substances such as caffeine and octopamine – might induce
increases
in
resting
energy
expenditure
and
lipolysis.
Although it has been suggested that the thermogenic effect
of Citrus aurantium might be related to the activation of the
β3 adrenergic receptors induced by p-synephrine [8], it is
impossible to determine whether these effects are produced
by the p-synephrine contained in Citrus aurantium supple-
ments or by the co-ingestion of other active substances in-
cluded in this type of supplements. The acute ingestion of
p-synephrine (21 mg or ~0.3 mg of p-synephrine per kg of
body mass), together with caffeine, produced a lower
perceived exertion during 30 min of moderate intensity
exercise [9]. In addition, the ingestion of p-synephrine
(100 mg or ~1.2 mg kg�1 for 3 days) alone or with caffeine
was effective at increasing the number of repetitions during
a squat resistance test [10]. On the other hand, the ingestion
of p-synephrine (3 mg kg�1) was ineffective at increasing
jump height or running speed in elite sprinters during
maximal running speed tests [11]. However, the effects of
acute
p-synephrine
ingestion
on
substrate
metabolism
during exercise have not been investigated yet despite the
use of p-synephrine-containing products in combination
with exercise programmes for weight loss.
The aim of this investigation was to determine the
effects of an acute dose of 3 mg kg�1 of p-synephrine on fat
and carbohydrate metabolism at rest and during exercise of
incremental intensity. Based on previous investigations at
rest and with the use of Citrus aurantium supplements –that
contained p-synephrine among other active substances – we
hypothesized
that
p-synephrine
would
increase
energy
expenditure
and
fat
oxidation
rate
during
exercise
in
healthy participants.
Methods
Subjects
Eighteen young and healthy participants volunteered to par-
ticipate in this investigation (age: 26.0 ± 7.2 years; body mass:
71.3 ± 7.36 kg; body height: 179 ± 7 cm and body mass index:
22.2 ± 1.9 kg m2). All participants were considered physically
active because they had previous experience in endurance ex-
ercise activities such as running and cycling (~1 h day�1,
~3 days week�1) at least during the three previous years. All
participants were non-smokers, had no previous history of
cardiopulmonary diseases and had suffered no musculoskele-
tal injuries in the previous 6 months. Participants were en-
couraged to avoid medications, nutritional supplements
and sympathetic stimulants for the duration of the study
and compliance was examined with dietary questionnaires.
One week before the start of the study, participants were fully
informed of the experimental standards and the risks and
discomforts associated with the research and signed an
informed written consent to participate in the investigation.
The study was approved by the Camilo José Cela University
Research Ethics Committee in accordance with the latest ver-
sion of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Experimental design
A
double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
randomized
and
counterbalanced experimental design was used in this in-
vestigation. Each participant took part in two experimental
trials separated by 3 days in order to allow complete recov-
ery and p-synephrine wash-out. On one occasion, partici-
pants ingested 3 mg of p-synephrine per kg of body mass
(99% purity; Synephrine HCL, Nutrition Power, Spain)
contained within an opaque capsule. This dosage was
higher than previous investigations in which p-synephrine
[10] or Citrus aurantium supplements [9] were administered
before exercise activities but it was based on a previous pub-
lication in which 3 mg kg�1 of p-synephrine had minimal
side-effects on elite sprinters [11]. On another occasion, par-
ticipants ingested an identical capsule filled with a placebo
(cellulose). The capsules were ingested with 150 ml of tap
water 60 min before the onset of the experimental trials.
An alphanumeric code was assigned to each trial by a per-
son independent to the study to blind participants and in-
vestigators
to
the
substances
tested.
Environmental
temperature and humidity were recorded using a digital
temperature and humidity monitor (OH1001, OH Haus,
Spain), and the average environmental conditions during
testing were 20.3 ± 0.6°C air temperature and 44 ± 16%
relative humidity.

 Experimental protocol
Two days before the first experimental trial, participants
were nude-weighed to calculate the p-synephrine dosage.
Twenty-four hours before each experimental trial, partici-
pants refrained from strenuous exercise and adopted a similar
diet and fluid intake regimen. For this control, subjects were
requested to complete a 24-h dietary record on the day before
the first laboratory visit and to follow the same dietary pat-
tern before the second visit. Subjects were required to refrain
from alcohol-, caffeine-, and citrus-containing products and
foods for 48 h before each laboratory visit. Participants were
encouraged to attend in fasting-state (at least 8 h before their
last meal) prior to each experimental trial. Compliance with
these experimental controls was verbally confirmed with
the subjects before commencing each experimental session.
The
day
of
the
experimental
trials,
participants
arrived at the laboratory at 09.00 and the capsule containing
p-synephrine or placebo was individually provided in un-
identifiable bags. Participants were dressed in a T-shirt and
shorts, and a heart rate belt (PolarW, Finland) was attached
to their chest. After that, they rested supine for 60 min to al-
low p-synephrine/cellulose absorption. Later, gas exchange
data were collected continuously for 15 min using an
automated breath-by-breath system (Metalyzer 3B, Cortex,
Germany) to calculate resting oxygen uptake (VO2) and car-
bon dioxide production (VCO2). During the last 5-min of this
collection period, the gas exchange data were averaged to
achieve a representative value for these variables. For this
measurement, participants remained lying still with no visual
or acoustic stimulus. Certified calibration gases (16.0% O2;
5.0% CO2, Cortex, Germany) and a 3-l syringe were used to
calibrate the gas analyser and the flowmeter before each trial.
During this period, resting heart rate was continuously
measured and averaged for the same 5-min period. Systolic
blood pressure and fourth phase diastolic blood pressure were
measured by triplicate on the left arm using an automatic
sphygmomanometer (M6 Comfort, Omron, Japan) while
the participant lay supine. An average of three blood pressure
measurements was used for analysis.
After the resting measurements, participants performed a
standardized warm-up that included 10 min at 50 W on a cy-
cle ergometer (SNT Medical, Cardgirus, Spain) and completed
an incremental exercise test on the cycle ergometer that in-
cluded increases of 25 W each 3 min until volitional fatigue
(the initial workload was set at 50 W). Expired gases were col-
lected with the same stationary breath-by-breath device used
for
the
resting
measurements
(MetaLyzer
3B,
Cortex,
Germany) to calculate oxygen uptake (VO2) and carbon diox-
ide production (VCO2) during exercise. During the incremen-
tal exercise intensity test, the VO2peak was defined as the
highest VO2 value. The VO2peak was considered valid when
the following end criteria were reached at the end of the test:
the VO2 difference between the last two consecutive loads
was less than 0.15 l min�1, the respiratory exchange ratio
was higher than 1.10, the participant’s rating of perceived ex-
ertion (6-to-20 point Borg scale) was higher than 19 points,
while heart rate was great than 80% of the age-adjusted
estimate of maximal heart rate [12].
The same test with the identical workloads and times was
used for the two experimental trials, while an individually
chosen cadency (between 70 and 90 rpm for all participants)
was replicated on both days. All subjects were familiarized
with this test by performing a familiarization trial at least
one week before the onset of the experimental trials. During
the last minute of each stage, the gas exchange data were av-
eraged every 15 s in order to achieve a representative value.
Absolute exercise intensity (in W) was normalized by using
the individual’s VO2peak. For each individual, the measured
variables were used to construct curves of energy rate and
substrate metabolism rates vs. exercise intensity, expressed
as %VO2peak, following a previous investigation by Achten
et al. [13].
Calculations
The rates of energy expenditure and substrate oxidation
(fat and carbohydrate) were calculated using the non-protein
respiratory quotient [14, 15]. Energy expenditure (kcal min�1)
at rest and during exercise was calculated as (3.869 × VO2) +
(1.195 × VCO2), where VO2 and VCO2 are in l min�1. Fat
oxidation rate (g min�1) was calculated as (1.67 × VO2)
� (1.67 × VCO2) and carbohydrate oxidation rate (g min�1)
was calculated as (4.55 × VCO2) � (3.21 × VO2) [14]. The rate
of maximal fat oxidation was individually calculated for each
participant as the highest value of fat oxidation rate obtained
during the incremental exercise intensity test. The exercise at
which maximal fat oxidation was achieved was also obtained
for each individual.
Statistical analysis
Data were collected as previously indicated and the results of
each test were subsequently blindly introduced into the sta-
tistical package SPSS v20.0 and analysed. The normality of
each quantitative variable was initially tested with the
Shapiro–Wilk test. All the quantitative variables included in
this investigation presented a normal distribution (P > 0.05)
and parametric statistics were used to determine differences
between p-synephrine and the placebo. A one-way analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the energy expendi-
ture and carbohydrate and fat oxidation, heart rate and blood
pressure at rest. A two-way ANOVA (treatment × load) was used to
compare these variables during exercise. After a significant F-test
(Geisser–Greenhouse correction for the assumption of spheric-
ity), differences between means were identified using Tukey’s
post-hoc procedure. The significance level was set at P < 0.05.
All data are presented as means ± standard deviation. The effect
size (d) was calculated in all pairwise comparisons according to
the formula proposed by Glass et al. [16]. The magnitude of
the effect size, in absolute values, was interpreted using the scale
of Cohen [17]: an effect size lower than 0.2 was considered as
small, an effect size around 0.5 was considered as medium and
an effect size over 0.8 was considered large. The criterion for sta-
tistical significance was set at P < 0.05.
Results
In comparison with the placebo, the ingestion of 3 mg kg�1 of p-
synephrine did not change resting VO2 or VCO2 values (Table 1;
P > 0.05). Thus, energy expenditure and substrate metabolism
at rest were unchanged by the ingestion of p-synephrine. This
substance did not modify heart rate or systolic and diastolic

 blood pressure at rest (P > 0.05). The effect sizes induced by the
ingestion of p-synephrine were small-to-moderate in all meta-
bolic and cardiovascular variables measured at rest.
Figure 1 depicts energy expenditure rate and heart rate dur-
ing the ramp exercise protocol. Both variables progressively
increased with exercise intensity but p-synephrine did not
modify the energy expenditure–exercise intensity and heart
rate–exercise intensity relationships (P > 0.05). Figure 2 depicts
substrate oxidation during the ramp exercise protocol, obtained
from VO2 and VCO2 values. The ingestion of p-synephrine

 moved the fat oxidation–exercise intensity curve upwards dur-
ing the incremental exercise protocol and produced signifi-
cantly higher fat oxidation rates at 40, 50, 60, 70 and 80% of
VO2peak when compared with the ingestion of the placebo
(P < 0.05). Conversely, the ingestion of p-synephrine shifted
the carbohydrate oxidation–exercise intensity curve down-
wards with lower carbohydrate oxidation rates at all intensities
ranging from 40 to 70% VO2peak (Figure 2; P < 0.05).
Figure 3 depicts group mean and individual values for
maximal fat oxidation obtained during the experimental tri-
als. On average, p-synephrine increased maximal fat oxida-
tion rate (0.29 ± 0.15 vs. 0.40 ± 0.18 g min�1; P = 0.01) with
a moderate effect size (d = 0.79), over the values obtained with
the ingestion of the placebo. However, the pre-exercise inges-
tion of p-synephrine did not affect the intensity at which
maximal
fat
oxidation
was
achieved
(55.8
±

vs.
56.7 ± 8.2% VO2peak; P = 0.51, d = 0.01). Out of 18 partici-
pants, 13 (72% of the sample) obtained a higher maximal
fat oxidation with p-synephrine while the remaining five ob-
tained a higher maximal fat oxidation with the ingestion of
the placebo.
Discussion
The use of Citrus aurantium and its main protoalkaloid con-
stituent p-synephrine has greatly increased in the last few
years among exercise practitioners seeking body fat and body
weight reduction due to the prohibition of ephedra- and
ephedrine-containing dietary supplements [4]. However, in-
vestigations about the efficacy of p-synephrine-containing
supplements on substrate metabolism are scarce and there is
little information about the physiological outcomes derived
from the combination of p-synephrine and exercise. For this
reason, this investigation aimed to determine the effects of
an acute ingestion of a high dose of p-synephrine on energy
expenditure and substrate metabolism at rest and during ex-
ercise. The main outcomes of this investigation when com-
pared to the ingestion of a placebo were: the p-synephrine
intake: (a) did not modify energy expenditure, fat and carbo-
hydrate oxidation rate at rest, nor increase heart rate, systolic
or
diastolic
blood
pressure
(Table
1);
(b)
significantly
increased fat oxidation rate at the same relative workload at
intensities ranging from low to moderate while it reduced
carbohydrate
utilization
during
exercise;
(c)
did
not
modify energy expenditure or heart rate during exercise of
increasing intensity. In the light of these results, 3 mg kg�1
of p-synephrine could be used as a supplement to increase
fat oxidation during exercise of moderate intensity.
Few studies have been geared to elucidating the effective-
ness of p-synephrine intake on energy expenditure at rest [5].
In some of them, multicomponent supplements containing
Citrus aurantium increased resting metabolic rate after acute
[6, 18–21] or chronic ingestion of these types of supplements
[7, 22]. However, in most of these investigations, the
experimental supplements contained other stimulants and
sympathomimetic substances in addition to p-synephrine,
such as caffeine, a well-recognized thermogenic substance
[23]. Thus, it is difficult to know whether to attribute this
increased
energy
expenditure
to
p-synephrine
or
the
remaining substances included in the administered products.
In the present investigation, we used a commercially avail-
able p-synephrine supplement with a purity of 99%, while
the ingestion of other stimulants was restricted to isolate
the effects of p-synephrine in the outcomes of this study.
Interestingly,
the
ingestion
of
p-synephrine
did
not
change energy expenditure or the use of fat and carbohydrate
at rest (Table 1), despite our dose (3 mg kg�1 equivalent to
214 mg of p-synephrine) being much higher than that
used in most (ranging from 12 to 100 mg of p-synephrine
[7, 9, 10, 18–22]), but not all, previous investigations
(216 mg of p-synephrine [11]). Thus, it is likely that the
purported thermogenesis attributed to Citrus aurantium and other
p-synephrine-containing supplements at rest [6, 7, 18–22] is
more related to other co-ingredients included in this type of
thermogenic supplements – such as caffeine – than to the isolated
effects of p-synephrine.
The
efficacy
of
p-synephrine
to
improve
physical
performance during exercise also remains unclear. The inges-
tion of p-synephrine, in combination with caffeine, has
been found effective to reduce perceived exertion during
prolonged exercise of moderate intensity [9], while the intake
of p-synephrine alone, for three consecutive days, was effec-
tive to increase the number of repetitions during a resistance
exercise test [10]. On the other hand, the pre-exercise inges-
tion of p-synephrine was ineffective to increase jump height
or maximal running speed of elite sprinters [11]. In the
current investigation we did not measure physical perfor-
mance but we assessed substrate metabolism during exercise
of increasing intensity. Interestingly, p-synephrine did not
modify energy expenditure or heart rate during exercise but
it greatly modified substrate utilization at workloads between

 40 and 80% of VO2peak (Figure 2). At these exercise intensi-
ties, the pre-exercise intake of p-synephrine shifted substrate
utilization towards fat while it reduced the use of carbohy-
drates. The effect of p-synephrine was not present at higher
exercise intensities mostly due to the suppression of fat oxi-
dation at high energy demands that reduced fat oxidation
to ~0 g min�1 above 90% VO2peak, as previously found [13].
The data of previous investigations about p-synephrine and
exercise performance, together with the data provided by
the current study, suggest that p-synephrine could be
‘ergogenic’
in
aerobic
exercise
activities
with
certain
reliance of fat metabolism (such as prolonged/moderate
intensity exercise or resistance exercise [9, 10]), while the
effects of p-synephrine would not be present in sprint-based
exercise activities in which fat oxidation is negligible [11].
Figure 2 indicates that the pre-exercise ingestion of a high
dose of p-synephrine was able to increase whole-body fat ox-
idation rate during exercise of low-to-moderate intensity,
likely due to a higher use of fat in the mitochondria of active
muscles. However, our investigation does not offer informa-
tion about the exact mechanism related to this metabolic ef-
fect. It has been found previously that p-synephrine has a
poor binding affinity to α1, α2, β1 and β2 adrenergic receptors
[8]. However, p-synephrine activates β3 adrenergic receptors
that may be responsible for the increased fat utilization dur-
ing
exercise
through
modulation
of
lipolysis
via
the
epinephrine- and norepinephrine-induced activation of ade-
nylate cyclase [19]. As this is the first investigation to deter-
mine
the
effects
of
p-synephrine
intake
on
substrate
metabolism during exercise, there is a need for further inves-
tigations to discover the mechanism(s) responsible for the in-
creased fat oxidation of this substance.
Numerous exercise physiology investigations have tried
to determine the best circumstances to obtain the maximal
fat oxidation rate (e.g., Fatmax) during exercise. Briefly, they
have established the notion that Fatmax is normally obtained
when exercising at moderate intensity, between 40 and 60%
of VO2max [13, 24], while factors such as exercise duration
[25], aerobic fitness [26], pre-exercise meal [27] and ambient
temperature [28] can substantially modify the amount of
fat
oxidized
at
a
fixed
workload.
The
current
data
indicate that p-synephrine can aid to increase Fatmax as it
augmented maximal fat oxidation rate by ~38% (Figure 3).
However, p-synephrine did not change the exercise at
which Fatmax was obtained because Fatmax was obtained at
~56% VO2peak in both trials. Although increased Fatmax
values were not present in all participants in this investigation
(5 out of 18 participants did not benefit from p-synephrine
ingestion), this positive outcome might be valuable for those
seeking increased fat utilization during exercise.
Conclusions
An acute p-synephrine intake of 3 mg kg�1 in healthy and ac-
tive participants had no effect on energy expenditure and
substrate oxidation at rest, and heart rate and blood pressure
remained unchanged under this condition. Nevertheless, this
substance produced a noteworthy change in substrate utiliza-
tion during exercise because it increased fat oxidation rate
while it reduced carbohydrate oxidation rate when exercising
at low-to-moderate intensities. In fact, p-synephrine in-
creased the maximal rate offat oxidation by 0.11 ± 0.7 g min�1,
which might represent an augmented fat utilization of 7 g of
fat per hour of exercise despite exercising at the same inten-
sity and at the same heart rate. However, it is necessary to de-
termine the effects of long-term administration of this
substance on energy and substrate metabolism at rest and
during exercise.
