IMPORTANCE Effective therapy has not been established for patients with agitated delirium
receiving mechanical ventilation.
OBJECTIVE To determine the effectiveness of dexmedetomidine when added to standard
care in patients with agitated delirium receiving mechanical ventilation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Dexmedetomidine to Lessen ICU Agitation
(DahLIA) study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group randomized clinical
trial involving 74 adult patients in whom extubation was considered inappropriate because of
the severity of agitation and delirium. The study was conducted at 15 intensive care units in
Australia and New Zealand from May 2011 until December 2013. Patients with advanced
dementia or traumatic brain injury were excluded.
INTERVENTIONS Bedside nursing staff administered dexmedetomidine (or placebo) initially
at a rate of 0.5 μg/kg/h and then titrated to rates between 0 and 1.5 μg/kg/h to achieve
physician-prescribed sedation goals. The study drug or placebo was continued until no longer
required or up to 7 days. All other care was at the discretion of the treating physician.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Ventilator-free hours in the 7 days following randomization.
There were 21 reported secondary outcomes that were defined a priori.
RESULTS Of the 74 randomized patients (median age, 57 years; 18 [24%] women), 2 withdrew
consent later and 1 was found to have been randomized incorrectly, leaving 39 patients in the
dexmedetomidine group and 32 patients in the placebo group for analysis. Dexmedetomidine
increased ventilator-free hours at 7 days compared with placebo (median, 144.8 hours vs 127.5
hours, respectively; median difference between groups, 17.0 hours [95% CI, 4.0 to 33.2 hours];
P = .01). Among the 21 a priori secondary outcomes, none were significantly worse with
dexmedetomidine, and several showed statistically significant benefit, including reduced time
to extubation (median, 21.9 hours vs 44.3 hours with placebo; median difference between
groups, 19.5 hours [95% CI, 5.3 to 31.1 hours]; P < .001) and accelerated resolution of delirium
(median, 23.3 hours vs 40.0 hours; median difference between groups, 16.0 hours [95% CI, 3.0
to 28.0 hours]; P = .01). Using hierarchical Cox modeling to adjust for imbalanced baseline
characteristics, allocation to dexmedetomidine was significantly associated with earlier
extubation (hazard ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.27-0.82]; P = .007).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among patients with agitated delirium receiving mechanical
ventilation in the intensive care unit, the addition of dexmedetomidine to standard care
compared with standard care alone (placebo) resulted in more ventilator-free hours at 7 days.
The findings support the use of dexmedetomidine in patients such as these.

Delirium is associated with increased mortality3
and decreased long-term cognitive function.4,5 Agi-
tated delirium is particularly problematic in patients receiv-
ing mechanical ventilation because it increases the risk
of self-extubation and removal of other essential medical
devices.6 Identification of an agent that shortens the dura-
tion of established delirium would be an important therapeu-
tic advance.
Dexmedetomidine, a sedative α2-agonist, is theoretically
an attractive treatment for patients with agitated delirium in
the intensive care unit (ICU) because unlike other sedatives,
it induces a calm yet rousable state with preserved respira-
torydrive,therebyallowingittobecontinuedafterextubation.7
However, to our knowledge, no trial has compared dexme-
detomidine with placebo for the treatment of patients receiv-
ing mechanical ventilation who would be candidates for ex-
tubation based on respiratory, cardiovascular, and metabolic
criteria but who remain intubated because of severe agitated
delirium. Accordingly, we tested the hypothesis that dexme-
detomidine,whenaddedtoallotherelementsofstandardcare,
would result in shorter duration of delirium and earlier extu-
bation in such patients.
Methods
TheDexmedetomidinetoLessenICUAgitation(DahLIA)study
was a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled mul-
ticenter randomized trial in which intubated ICU patients were
allocated randomly 1:1 to receive dexmedetomidine or saline
as a treatment for agitated delirium. No other aspect of pa-
tient care was constrained, with the exception that clonidine
was prohibited due to its potential interaction with dexme-
detomidine.
The trial was conducted between May 9, 2011, and Decem-
ber 23, 2013, in the ICUs of 15 hospitals in Australia and
New Zealand, 14 of which are mixed medical-surgical units
(7 tertiary academic and 7 metropolitan) and 1 of which ad-
mits primarily postoperative cardiac surgical patients. The trial
protocol, which contains the statistical analysis plan, ap-
pears in Supplement 1. The trial protocol was approved by the
Austin Hospital human research ethics committee and, where
required, by individual hospital ethics committees.
Consent was sought from the person responsible for the
patient. In some jurisdictions, if this person could not be con-
tacted, the patient could be enrolled in anticipation of retro-
spective consent. In other jurisdictions, eligible patients were
enrolled when the treating clinician considered participation
to be in the patient’
s best interest; however, patients were not
included if relatives indicated that the patient would not wish
to participate.
Once the patient had recovered sufficiently, all had the op-
portunity to provide fully informed consent to the use of data
and ongoing study participation. Either the patient or person
responsible could withdraw consent at any stage. A data and
safety monitoring committee reviewed all adverse effects.
There was no interim analysis.
Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) were eligible for the study
if, in the opinion of their treating physician, they continued
to require mechanical ventilation only because their degree of
agitation was so severe as to make lessening their sedation and
extubation unsafe. These criteria were quantified objectively
by requiring that the patient should meet all of these addi-
tional criteria during the 4 hours prior to randomization:
(1) need for mechanical restraint, antipsychotic or sedative
medication, or both restraint and medication; (2) have Con-
fusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)8 results that
indicated presence of delirium; and (3) have a Motor Activity
AssessmentScale(MAAS)score9of5orgreater,confirmingpsy-
chomotor agitation.
Patients were excluded if they (1) were pregnant or breast-
feeding, (2) had dementia that required professional nursing
care, (3) had a head injury as the cause of their altered mental
state,(4)werealreadyreceivingdexmedetomidineorclonidine
for sedation, (5) had been enrolled previously in the study,
or (6) there was a known contraindication to haloperidol or
α2-agonists.
Patients were randomized, stratified by site and age (<55
years and ≥55 years), in concealed permuted blocks of 2 to 6
by a computer-generated algorithm accessed via Internet con-
nection to the Australian and New Zealand Research Centre at
Monash University. Unblinded pharmacists or nurses neither
caring for the patient nor involved in the trial prepared the
study drug in identically labeled syringes. Patients in the dex-
medetomidine group were started with a dose of 0.5 μg/kg/h.
There was a clinician-directed option of a bolus of 1.0 μg/kg
over 20 minutes.10
Patients randomized to placebo received an identically la-
beledinfusionofsalineatanequivalentrate.Studymedication
was titrated by the bedside nurse between 0 and 1.5 μg/kg/h to
achieve a Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score11 of 0 or to
achievephysician-prescribedgoals.After48hoursofstudydrug
infusion,thetreatingphysiciancouldprescribeopen-labeldex-
medetomidine and the study drug infusion would be stopped.
Morethan7daysofinfusionofstudydrugwasconsideredtreat-
mentfailure;atthatpoint,thestudydrugwasstoppedandopen-
label dexmedetomidine could be commenced.
Extubation timing (or the decision to insert a tracheos-
tomy) was determined by senior ICU physicians, taking into
account the assessments of bedside nurses. This decision
was not part of the protocol, but instead was tailored to indi-
vidual patient circumstances, with a physician constantly
present at each ICU. Physicians and nurses treating study pa-
tients, and the study staff at each site, remained blinded to
group allocation.
The primary outcome was the number of ventilator-free
hours (the number of hours alive and free from requiring in-
vasive mechanical ventilation up until day 7 postrandomiza-
tion) during the incident ICU admission. Patients who had tra-
cheostomies inserted were considered to be free of sedation
(and so likely to have been extubated had a tracheostomy not
been inserted) after a 4-hour period in which they received no
sedatives or opioid analgesics.
The 21 reported secondary outcomes that were defined
a priori included time to extubation (in the case of tracheos-

spectively and by review of each clinical chart.
Modified intention-to-treat analyses were performed.
Modification was permitted to account for postrandomiza-
tion circumstances that prevented use of data from certain pa-
tients. Because there were no missing data for the primary out-
come and less than 5% missing for all secondary outcomes, no
data imputation was performed. Due to nonnormality, all con-
tinuous outcomes were compared using Mann-Whitney tests
withlocationshiftsbetweentreatmentgroupscalculatedusing
theHodges-Lehmannestimateandreportedusingdistribution-
free 95% confidence limits.
The sensitivity analysis accounting for multiple sites was
performed using the van Elteren statistic. Categorical out-
comes were compared using χ2 or Fisher exact tests and re-
ported as differences in proportion (95% confidence inter-
val). Time-to-event data were compared using log-rank tests
and presented as Kaplan-Meier curves. To account for any ef-
fectofsiteandforbaselineimbalances,aCoxproportionalhaz-
ards regression model was used with patients nested within
site, and site treated as a random effect with the following co-
variates included in the model: Acute Physiology and Chronic
HealthEvaluationIIdiagnosis,durationofintubation,andelec-
tivestatus.Proportionalityassumptionsweredeterminedusing
log survival plots.
All statistical analyses were performed using Stata version
11.2 (StataCorp) or SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) with a
2-sidedPvalueoflessthan.05consideredsignificant.Noadjust-
mentwasmadeformultiplecomparisons,andsothesecondary
outcomes presented (although all prespecified) should be con-
sidered exploratory, yielding hypothesis-generating findings.
Based on a pilot study with a mean control estimate of 108
ventilator-free hours (SD, 46 ventilator-free hours) and a mean
dexmedetomidine group estimate of 148 ventilator-free hours
(SD, 15 ventilator-free hours),12 a sample size of 96 patients was
estimated to provide 80% power to detect a 20-hour differ-
ence (ie, half the effect size observed in a pilot study) using a
2-tailed hypothesis at an α level of .05. These calculations in-
clude an inflation rate of 15% to account for the possibility that
ventilation-free days would not be normally distributed.13
However, the sponsoring pharmaceutical company (Ho-
spira Australia) decided against extending funding and pro-
visionofstudydrugbeyondadatethathadbeenearlieragreed.
Consequently, the trial was terminated prematurely in Decem-
ber 2013 after 74 patients had been randomized. At no stage
didthepharmaceuticalcompanyhaveaccesstothestudydata,
and no data analysis by the study investigators had occurred
prior to this decision.
To account for the possibility that early termination may
exaggerate the effect size, additional analyses were per-
formed post hoc to assess the likelihood of a null finding had
the study been completed as originally planned. These analy-
ses were performed using 10 000 simulations based first on
the assumption that nonenrolled patients came from the origi-
nal projected population and then second based on the as-
sumption that the nonenrolled patients came from the ob-
served population.

acteristics of study participants appear in Table 1.
Almost all patients were sedated with propofol. Approxi-
mately one-third of the patients required mechanical re-
straint immediately prior to randomization and 20% re-
ceived an antipsychotic drug. The median Acute Physiology
and Chronic Health Evaluation II score immediately prior to
randomization was low, reflecting the inclusion criterion that
these patients should be ready for extubation except for hav-
ing agitated delirium.
One male patient randomized to receive dexmedetomi-
dine did not receive any study drug because his physician
decided the delirium had resolved almost immediately
after randomization. While blinded to study drug allocation,
the treating physician of 1 patient randomized to placebo
decided, after 48 hours of administering the placebo study
drug, optimal treatment would be dexmedetomidine. There-
fore, open-label dexmedetomidine was commenced, and the
placebo study drug was stopped. Five patients (1 allocated to
dexmedetomidine and 4 to placebo) received open-label
dexmedetomidine after administration of the study drug for
7 days.
Compared with the dexmedetomidine group, patients al-
located to the placebo group received a significantly greater
rate and volume of study drug on days 1 and 2 (Table 2). More
patients in the placebo group received antipsychotic medica-
tions (haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine) on
any day than was true for the dexmedetomidine group (65.6%
vs 36.8%, respectively; mean difference between groups,
−28.8% [95% CI, −51.3% to −6.3%; P = .02). There were no sig-
nificantdifferencesintheuseofindividualantipsychoticdrugs
(eTable 1 in Supplement 2). On several days, significantly lower
quantities of intercurrent sedatives (propofol and mid-
azolam) and opioids (morphine and fentanyl) were used in the
dexmedetomidine group compared with the placebo group
(eTable 2).

During the 7 days after randomization, propofol use was
commoninbothgroups(71.8%ofthedexmedetomidinegroup
and 87.5% of the placebo group). The median dosage was sig-
nificantly higher in the placebo group (5390 mg [interquar-

medetomidine group (980 mg [IQR, 280 to 3050 mg]) (median
difference between groups, −3094.5 mg [95% CI, −5852 to

midine group; mean difference between groups, −21.6% [95%

differences between groups in the proportion of patients
who required tracheostomy (Table 3). A sensitivity analysis
examining only patients who did not receive a tracheostomy
showed the same qualitative difference in ventilator-free
hours (median, 147.3 hours [IQR, 131-158 hours] in the dex-
medetomidine group vs 128 hours [IQR, 92-143 hours] in the
placebo group; median difference between groups, 19.5

In the time to event analysis, dexmedetomidine was as-
sociated with earlier extubation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58 [95%

of the procedure, there was no difference in qualitative out-
come (HR, 0.39 [95% CI, 0.21-0.71]; P = .002).
The median time to extubation was 21.9 hours for the dex-
medetomidine group vs 44.3 hours for the placebo group (me-
dian difference between groups, 19.5 hours [95% CI, 5.3 to 31.1
hours]; P < .001; van Elteren site-adjusted P = .004). Bedside
nurses thought their patients were ready to extubate signifi-
cantly earlier (P < .001) if they were receiving dexmedetomi-
dine (median, 19.1 hours [IQR, 16.7 to 25.8 hours]) than if they
were receiving placebo (median, 40.5 hours [IQR, 21.1 to 90.7
hours]) (median difference between groups, −21.1 hours [95%
CI, −6.0 to −34.5 hours]). The median ICU length of stay was
2.9 days (IQR, 2.1 to 4.9 days) with dexmedetomidine vs 4.1
days (IQR, 3.0 to 7.9 days) with placebo (P = .09).
An additional post hoc simulation analysis calculating the
probability of finding no difference in the median duration of
ventilator-free hours during the first 7 days after randomiza-
tion if the trial included the planned number of patients (using
boththeoriginaldesigneffectsandtheobservedeffects)found
achanceoflessthan7%ofproducinganullresult(P > .05)(cal-
culated using either approach). This lack of likely qualitative
difference occurred because the observed treatment effect in
this study was very similar to that projected.
Allocation to dexmedetomidine was associated with sev-
eral improved indices of delirium (Table 3). With dexmedeto-
midine, delirium resolved more rapidly (median, 23.3 hours
vs 40.0 hours in the placebo group; median difference be-
tween groups, 16.0 hours [95% CI, 3.0-28.0 hours]; P = .01; van
Elterensite-adjustedP = .04).Comparedwiththepatientswho
received placebo, the patients who received dexmedetomi-
dine had delirium for a lower proportion of their ICU stay, and
had a median of 2 additional delirium-free days during their
ICU stay. There was no between-group difference in the time
taken to achieve a satisfactory sedation score.
The time taken to achieve a satisfactory MAAS score (or
proportion of time spent with a satisfactory MAAS score) can-
not be reported because almost no patients had a MAAS score
recorded after that which was assessed by the study research
coordinator at the time of study entry. The protocol required
bedside nurses to collect MAAS scores; however, less atten-
tion was provided to educate the nurses regarding collection
of the MAAS score than the CAM-ICU. This absence of data was
missed during interim monitoring, preventing remediation of
the problem during the conduct of the trial.
Adverse events (bradycardia requiring interruption of
study drug, hypotension requiring vasopressor support, and
agitation requiring temporarily increased sedation) were rare
and not different between study groups. Two of 39 patients
in the dexmedetomidine group and 2 of 32 patients in the pla-
cebo group received a bolus of dexmedetomidine. None of
these patients were among those who experienced a brady-
cardia-related adverse event. A patient with known cardio-
myopathy developed ventricular tachycardia 8 hours after ces-
sation of the study drug; however, the data and safety
monitoring committee ruled that this was not related to the
study, and the protocol continued without modification.
There were no statistically significant differences be-
tween the groups in Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment
score on any study day. As expected in this comparatively re-
covered cohort of critically ill patients, ICU and hospital mor-
tality were low and not different between groups. Only 1 pa-
tient required reintubation, which occurred 2 hours following
elective extubation. No patient self-extubated.
Discussion
In this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial in-
volving patients with agitated delirium receiving mechanical
ventilation, who were primarily receiving propofol-based se-
dation and antipsychotic medications determined by their
treating physicians, dexmedetomidine increased the num-
ber of ventilator-free hours during the 7 days following ran-
domization. Compared with placebo, dexmedetomidine has-
tened the resolution of delirium and extubation in patients by
approximately 1 day. Adverse events were rare and not differ-
ent between the groups.
The results of this study are consistent with earlier large
randomized clinical trials comparing dexmedetomidine with
benzodiazepines or propofol as a sedative, which found dex-
medetomidine was associated with less delirium in the ICU15,16
and reduced time to extubation.17 However, these were trials
of dexmedetomidine as a sedative rather than as a treatment
for delirium. Suggestion of a therapeutic effect of dexmedeto-
midine in established delirium was present in the Safety and
Efficacy of Dexmedetomidine Compared With Midazolam
trial.16 In the post hoc analysis of the 60% of patients who had
CAM-ICUresultsindicatingthepresenceofdeliriumatthetime
of randomization, there was a reduction in the prevalence of
delirium from 95.5% to 68.7%.
Dexmedetomidine had a propofol- and fentanyl-sparing
effect on day 1. It is possible that deliriogenic sedatives were
replaced with alternatives less prone to cause delirium.
However, propofol and opioids are probably less delirio-
genic than benzodiazepines,18 and nonbenzodiazepine
alternatives were the overwhelming choice for intercurrent
care. Therefore, a direct antidelirium effect of dexmedeto-
midine remains possible. How an α2-agonist might exert this

effect remains speculative.19 It is possible that the analgesic
effects of dexmedetomidine might have lessened both agi-
tation and delirium.
Our study is the same size as the largest previous trial20
of therapy for patients with agitated delirium determined by
the CAM-ICU; that study compared (nonblinded) dexmedeto-
midine with midazolam in 72 patients who had been intu-
bated after undergoing elective cardiac surgery. Patients in the
dexmedetomidine group were extubated earlier (46.6 hours
vs 58.3 hours in the midazolam group, P < .001), but the be-
tween-group comparisons of agitated delirium were not re-
ported. This study showed the superiority of dexmedetomi-
dine over midazolam as a sedative for patients with agitated
delirium who had undergone intubation. However, given con-
sensus recommendations against benzodiazepines in these
circumstances,18 this is less relevant than the question ad-
dressed by our study.
To our knowledge, the only other published trial target-
ing patients with agitated delirium was a single-center pilot
study of 20 patients, which compared nonblinded infusions
of dexmedetomidine or haloperidol. Dexmedetomidine short-
enedtimetoextubation(from42.5hoursto19.2hours,P = .02)
and ICU length of stay (from 6.5 days to 1.5 days, P = .004). In
ourlargertrial,only30.4%ofpatientsreceivedhaloperidoland
a higher percentage received atypical antipsychotics.
The only previous delirium pharmacotherapy placebo-
controlled trial (in which only 30.6% had a Riker Sedation-
Agitation Scale21 score of ≥5 at the time of enrollment, sug-
gesting agitated delirium)22 had a similar design to that of our
study.Patients(notallintubatedatthetimeofenrollment)were
randomized to quetiapine or placebo, with all other elements
of care as directed by the physician. Both groups received as-
needed haloperidol. Delirium resolved faster with quetiap-
ine but duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of
stay were similar to placebo.
This study has several strengths. First, it used a double-
blind, multicenter, randomized, permuted block, placebo-
controlled design. Second, the study had objective enroll-
mentcriteria.Third,theprimaryendpointwaspatientcentered
and with likely financial cost-benefit implications. Fourth, the
protocol replicated current practice by having bedside nurses
independently titrating the study drug to either a physician-
prescribed sedation goal or a default goal of light sedation.
Fifth, all other therapies were consistent with current consen-
susrecommendations.18Sixth,thedevelopmentoflackofphy-
sician equipoise was accommodated by permitting open-
label dexmedetomidine after patients had received the study
drug for 48 hours, but this had no effect on the results.
The study also has some limitations. The planned 96 pa-
tientswerenotrecruited.Unplannedearlyterminationofclini-
cal trials can exaggerate effect size. However, the probability
of finding a qualitatively different result in the primary out-
come had the trial recruited to the target sample size was less
than 7%. The relatively small sample size led to several chance
imbalances in baseline characteristics, notably the duration of
ventilation before randomization. However, when adjusted for
this imbalance, dexmedetomidine remained associated with
earlier extubation. Although there was a difference in the pri-
maryoutcomeandseveralcongruentsecondaryoutcomes,the
study was underpowered to detect differences in important
end points including ICU length of stay.
Many patients (n = 21 500) were screened in the effort to
recruit only 74 patients; therefore, the results may not be gen-
eralizable to patients earlier in the course of their critical ill-
ness, with other forms of delirium, or not intubated. Only pa-
tientswhocouldbeextubated(wereitnotforagitateddelirium)
were recruited. Although we cannot say if the results apply to
patients with agitated delirium in the ICU earlier in their ill-
nesses, the dexmedetomidine sedative trials provide reassur-
ing evidence of safety and a suggestion of efficacy in this
patient group.
We cannot comment on whether dexmedetomidine might
be effective in patients with traumatic brain injury or demen-
tia. However, there is no evidence that dexmedetomidine
would harm such patients. Resolution of delirium was one of
the most important end points, but identification of delirium
in critically ill patients is problematic, as previously argued.23
Delirium was defined using the CAM-ICU, which has been the
subject of criticism for its false-positive results in the context
of recently discontinued sedation.24,25 Nonetheless, the
CAM-ICU is recommended by consensus guidelines18 and our
study was blinded.
Even though clinicians were blinded to study drug allo-
cation, dexmedetomidine often causes bradycardia,10 which
might have suggested study drug allocation. However, in agi-
tated patients receiving strong doses of sedating drugs to avoid
self-injury, changes in heart rate are common.
Conclusions
Among patients with agitated delirium receiving mechanical
ventilation in the ICU, the addition of dexmedetomidine to
standard care compared with standard care alone (placebo) re-
sultedinmoreventilator-freehoursat7days.Thefindingssup-
port the use of dexmedetomidine in patients such as these.
