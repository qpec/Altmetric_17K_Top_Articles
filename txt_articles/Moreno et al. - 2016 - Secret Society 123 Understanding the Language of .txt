Abstract
Purpose—Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) content is present on social media and may influence 
adolescents. Instagram is a popular site among adolescents in which NSSI-related terms are user-
generated as hashtags (words preceded by a #). These hashtags may be ambiguous and thus 
challenging for those outside the NSSI community to understand. The purpose of this study was to 
evaluate the meaning, popularity, and content advisory warnings related to ambiguous NSSI 
hashtags on Instagram.
Methods—This study used the search term “#selfharmmm” to identify public Instagram posts. 
Hashtag terms co-listed with #selfharmmm on each post were evaluated for inclusion criteria; 
selected hashtags were then assessed using a structured evaluation for meaning and consistency. 
We also investigated the total number of Instagram search hits for each hashtag at two time points 
and determined whether the hashtag prompted a Content Advisory warning.
Results—Our sample of 201 Instagram posts led to identification of 10 ambiguous NSSI 
hashtags. NSSI terms included #blithe, #cat, and #selfinjuryy. We discovered a popular image that 
described the broader community of NSSI and mental illness, called “#MySecretFamily.” The 
term #MySe-cretFamily had approximately 900,000 search results at Time 1 and >1.5 million at 
Time 2. Only one-third of the relevant hashtags generated Content Advisory warnings.
Conclusions—NSSI content is popular on Instagram and often veiled by ambiguous hashtags. 
Content Advisory warnings were not reliable; thus, parents and providers remain the cornerstone 
of prompting discussions about NSSI content on social media and providing resources for teens.

 and includes behaviors such as cutting, burning, and scratching [2]. Estimates of NSSI 
prevalence among adolescents typically range from 7% to 24% [3,4]; initiation is typically 
during middle school [5,6]. Rates of NSSI are higher among adolescents who have 
experienced childhood maltreatment [7] and among females, although some studies find 
equal rates across gender [5]. NSSI is associated with comorbid psychiatric illnesses such as 
depression and serious consequences such as suicide [2,8].
Exposure to peer NSSI may increase the risks of engaging in these behaviors via social 
contagion or normalization of these behaviors [2,9]. Social contagion can occur both offline 
and online; previous studies have illustrated NSSI content in online forums and on social 
media such as YouTube [2,10,11]. In one study, online NSSI content was a trigger for offline 
NSSI behaviors [12]. NSSI on social media is of particular interest given that social media 
content is typically peer generated and thus combines the influence of peers and media [13]. 
Social media also allow users to create online identities that may reflect their existing 
identity or a newly developing identity. Social media users can thus gain exposure to other 
users' online identities and posted content and build online communities around shared 
interests [13].
Recently, the social media site Instagram has received media attention regarding concerns 
about NSSI content [14,15]. Instagram is a photograph sharing site wherein information is 
shared by uploading a photograph labeled with a caption and with one or more hashtags. 
Hashtags are words or phrases without spaces between that are preceded by a # and are used 
on other social media sites such as Twitter. Hashtags allow content to be linked to larger 
online communities who also use the hashtag. Instagram also allows for individual 
anonymity by choosing a username, in contrast to some social media platforms such as 
Facebook where the terms of use specify that real names must be used. On Instagram, a user 
could maintain one account using their real name and a second NSSI-related account using a 
different username. Maintaining two Instagram accounts may allow a teen to feel that they 
can develop or maintain a separate “anonymous” NSSI-related identity. Content on 
Instagram is typically highly visual, public, personal, and easily accessed on any Internet 
accessible device. The visual nature of this site allows NSSI behaviors such as cutting to be 
viewed clearly and potentially imitated. Because most Instagram users are high school–age 
adolescents [16], and this site is currently considered a popular and “prestigious” social 
media site for this age group [17], the potential creators and consumers of NSSI-related 
content on this site are likely adolescents.
Instagram's terms of use discourage NSSI displays and describe that they will place 
warnings about dangerous content [18]. However, Instagram has come under media scrutiny 
for the presence of harmful material including content promoting eating disorders [15]. The 
hashtag #selfharm was previously used to build an Instagram community dedicated to NSSI 
[14]. After that, hashtag was reported to Instagram, the site blocked users from searching for 
content linked to that hashtag. The revised hashtag #selfharmm then emerged and was used 
in this same community. At present, this second hashtag has been blocked, and the term 
#selfharmmm is now a popular hashtag. Parents, educators, and clinicians may struggle to 
understand how to interpret hashtags and social media displays. Layperson media, such as

 blogs, report well meaning but nonempiric and often inaccurate interpretations of common 
NSSI terms [19].
The purpose of this study was to investigate ambiguous NSSI-related terms on Instagram 
including evaluation of meaning and consistency. Our goals were to (1) present current data 
on ambiguous hashtags that may be common parlance related to NSSI; (2) test a process to 
investigate ambiguous NSSI terms; (3) evaluate the popularity of NSSI-related hashtags at 
two time points; and (4) assess the precision of Instagram's warning labels for concerning 
content, by testing whether NSSI terms triggered Instagram's “Content Advisory” warning.
Methods
This study took place on the social media site Instagram (www.instagram.com). Using a 
commonly used NSSI hashtag of #selfharmmm as a search term, we identified a sample of 
content posted on Instagram between the dates of June 18, 2014 and June 30, 2014 for 
evaluation. From this sample, we identified and investigated a list of ambiguous hashtags 
that were potentially linked to NSSI. We investigated that these selected hashtags to 
determine meaning and consistency using a structured approach including triangulation of 
data. Triangulation of data is a critical concept in qualitative research described as using 
more than one approach to collect or evaluate data [20–22]. The triangulation approach is 
designed to enhance validity and minimize the risk that conclusions reflect only the biases or 
limitations of a single approach.
This study was determined to be exempt from Human Subjects Review by the Seattle 
Children's Institutional Review Board with the provision that no identifying information 
regarding potential minors was reported.
Search criteria: Identifying nonsuicidal self-injury posts on Instagram
Every photograph uploaded to Instagram, typically called a “post,” includes a caption and 
can be labeled with one or more hashtags. The main way to search on Instagram is by using 
a hashtag; searching for a particular hashtag allows one to access the community of public 
users who have labeled photographs with that hashtag. For this study, we used the search 
term “#self-harmmm” as it was among the most common NSSI search terms on Instagram 
that evolved from the initial term #selfharm [14].
Using the search term #selfharmmm, we assessed search results to identify a goal sample 
size of 200 publicly available relevant posts. This number was selected based on previous 
descriptive studies on social media suggesting that 200 posts allow for appropriate breadth 
of evaluation and saturation of themes in content analysis [23–25]. We selected a sample of 
225 posts to evaluate for eligibility based on estimates of approximately 10% of posts being 
excluded after our pilot evaluations. We evaluated publicly available posts as we were 
interested in what NSSI content was available to the general public of adolescent Instagram 
users. We excluded non-English posts. Based on Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
restrictions, we excluded posts from users who specifically reported age less than 18 years. 
The focus of evaluation for this study was hashtags represented within Instagram posts; thus, 
demographic information about the profile owners was not recorded.

 Selection of nonsuicidal self-injury–related hashtags for evaluation
For each post that met inclusion criteria, we examined the post and assessed all hashtags to 
select ambiguous potential NSSI-related hashtags for our structured evaluation process. We 
focused our study on NSSI as an understudied area of social media research; thus, we 
excluded hashtags related to eating disorders (e.g., #thinspo and #proana) or substance use 
(e.g., #legalizeit and #bupe) for two reasons. First, previous studies have examined social 
media content related to eating disorders [26,27] and substance use [28–33]. Second, in 
contrast to ambiguous NSSI terms, there are other resources (i.e., 
www.urbandictionary.com) available to assist with understanding ambiguous eating disorder 
and substance use terms. Hashtags with obvious meaning that would not require further 
evaluation, such as #depression, were also excluded. Figure 1 illustrates this selection 
process.
Development of the structured evaluation approach
The structured evaluation approach to evaluate hashtags was developed iteratively; this 
process was consistent with our established process for developing social media codebooks 
described in past publications [34,35]. Development of the structured evaluation began with 
investigators reviewing previous studies of adolescent NSSI [8,10]. Next, a proposed 
evaluation structure was developed based on the literature review. A small sample of pilot 
data was then tested with the approach, after which investigators met to discuss and revise 
criteria to evaluate meaning and consistency. The modified structure was followed by a test 
with another small pilot sample and an investigator meeting. An example of a revision was 
to add an evaluation step for term meaning across several social media sites using the site 
Tagboard. Once consensus and consistency were achieved in the coding approach, the study 
hashtags were evaluated by one investigator with a 10% subsample double coded for inter-
rater agreement assessment.
Evaluation of nonsuicidal self-injury–related hashtags
Each hashtag was evaluated to achieve three goals. First, we aimed to understand the 
definition of the hashtag by investigating meaning and consistency of the term using the 
structured approach. Second, we evaluated the number of search hits for #selfharmmm on 
Instagram at two randomly selected time points 5 months apart to illustrate its frequency and 
growth over time. Third, we recorded whether the hashtag generated a Content Advisory 
warning on Instagram.
Definition of hashtag based on meaning and consistency—Triangulation of data 
involves seeking or evaluating data using more than one method to decrease bias and 
improve the reliability of the finding [20,36,37]. Thus, to be considered a definition of an 
NSSI term, there must be consistent findings across three examinations: one to assess 
meaning and two to examine consistency.
First, to assess meaning, the displayed content was evaluated including images and text 
descriptions. To be considered a term with NSSI-related meaning, content that was 
describing, supporting, or promoting NSSI must be present among the search results for that 
hashtag. For example, the term “#blithe” was used to label photographs on Instagram that

 included images of self-harm such as cutting and downloaded icons that described self-
harm. Thus, this term was considered to have meaning as an NSSI-related term indicating 
self-harm.
To assess consistency of the term, a second criterion was that the term must be used on at 
least one other social media site with similar implied meaning. To investigate this, we used 
the Web site “Tagboard” (www.tagboard.com) which allows a keyword search for terms 
across several social media sites commonly used by adolescents including Instagram, 
Facebook, Twitter, Google plus, Vine, Tumblr, and Flickr [38]. For example, the term 
“#blithe” was used on Instagram to refer to self-harm; use of this term with similar meaning 
was found on Tumblr.
The third criterion was also to assess consistency; we used a Google search to verify that 
both the term use and image matched within the online NSSI community context. For 
images, we conducted a reverse search for the resource on Google. This was done by 
entering the image into Google's “search by image” function. We recognized that hashtags 
may have different meanings within different communities. A valid term should be created, 
disseminated, and referenced by people within the community of interest. If a hashtag 
generated different types of content on one site, or across different sites, we evaluated the 
hashtag in the context of the community using the term. For example, the term “#cat” was 
linked to a community of self-harm blogs on Tumblr, which shows use of that term in the 
same way among the community of interest. Another use of the term #cat was among groups 
of pet lovers, which is not a community dedicated to self-harm; thus, the definition of #cat in 
this community was expected to be different. In these cases, we verified that the term was 
used within NSSI online communities. This process is represented in Figure 2.
Number of search hits on Instagram—For this aim, we inserted the term into 
Instagram's search box and identified the number of results. Time 1 was at November 14, 
2014; Time 2 was at April 13, 2015.
Instagram content advisory warning—Instagram has installed various “pop-up” 
messages that are used to label content that Instagram considers to be potentially harmful. 
When a user attempts to view this type of content, a “Content Advisory” pop-up message 
presents a warning to users that images may contain graphic content. Included in this 
message are a “Learn More” button that links externally to what Instagram views as related 
information and resources, and a “Show Posts” button that allows the user to continue to 
view the content. For each hashtag, we recorded whether the content generated an Instagram 
“Content Advisory” warning.
Inter-rater reliability—To assess inter-rater reliability in NSSI meaning, two coders 
assessed a 10% subsample; inter-rater agreement for NSSI-related meaning was 100%.

 Results
Of the 225 Instagram posts examined, 201 met inclusion criteria; saturation was determined 
to be reached with this sample based on repeated hashtags. There were 193 unique 
usernames represented in the sample of posts.
A total of 10 hashtags representing NSSI were identified (Table 1). Most NSSI hashtags 
were represented more than one time because of variations in spelling and spacing 
arrangements, examples included #selfinjury and #blithe/#ehtilb.
A single hashtag, #MySecretFamily represented a family of associated terms including one 
NSSI and additional terms representing associated mental health concerns (Figure 3). 
Among the #MySecretFamily hashtags, the term #cat represented a specific NSSI action of 
cutting. Other terms represented related mental health conditions through use of common 
names, such as “#Deb” for depression, “#Annie” for anxiety, and “#Olive” for obsessive-
compulsive disorder. The #MySecretFamily image was typically used to represent the broad 
community of NSSI and mental health and was present across multiple social media sites 
including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Tumblr.
The number of search results for NSSI hashtags on Instagram was high, and use of all terms 
grew over time (Table 1). The broad term “cat” had the highest frequency with >44 million 
search results in 2014 and 56 million in 2015. Among the more narrow NSSI terms, 
“selfharmmm” had 1.7 million search results in 2014 and >2.4 million in 2015. “Secret 
society 123” in its various iterations grew by approximately 500,000 search results between 
the two time points.
Among the 18 total hashtags, only six generated a warning label on Instagram and redirected 
users to another site. Among the redirect sites, two hashtags, #blithe and #secretsociety123, 
redirected users to an Instagram help page for eating disorders. (Table 1)
Discussion
In this study of publicly available Instagram content linked to the hashtag “selfharmmm,” 
we identified ambiguous user-generated hashtags with meanings linked to NSSI and 
associated mental health concerns. We found frequent use of NSSI hashtags on Instagram, 
growth in their use over time, and limited evidence that the content advisory warning was 
useful in identifying NSSI terms consistently or inappropriate redirecting of content.
Our first finding was that ambiguous NSSI terms were used as hashtags labeling 
photographs on Instagram. For teens engaged in NSSI, hashtags may allow one to access 
and feel connected to an NSSI-related community, or serve as a trigger for NSSI behaviors 
[12]. For adolescents curious about NSSI, the visual nature of Instagram may provide easy 
access to instruction in how to engage in NSSI or normalize these behaviors as available 
emotional outlets.
We found that definitions for NSSI hashtags could be accurately and reliably determined 
using a structured set of searches and triangulating data. The consistency of definitions

 within NSSI communities across sites suggests that this community is highly invested in 
creating and maintaining a shared but elusive body of knowledge. NSSI hashtags allow 
adolescents to connect to a distinct NSSI subculture using terms that have unique definitions 
within that group. Ambiguous hashtags may have been motivated by a desire to avoid 
recognition from those outside the subculture, such as the unusual use of the word blithe, 
and spelling blithe backward in the use of the hashtag #ehtilb. However, Instagram is a 
public photograph sharing site in which users often post pictures of themselves. Thus, users 
may be recognized by those who know them via a photograph labeled with the hashtag.
Findings suggest that NSSI terms were common on Instagram, the term #secretsociety123 
had >500,000 hits. The other “secretive” term, #MySecretFamily, included various terms 
that overlapped with existing non-NSSI terms, such as #cat and #deb, which led to large 
numbers of search results for these particular terms. Terms such as #cat may be used to 
represent NSSI-related terms and unrelated terms. Given the overlap in terms used to 
represent very different content, NSSI content may be accessed by adolescent viewers by 
accident. For example, a teen seeking photographs of cute cats may be inadvertently exposed 
to photographs showing cutting.
Finally, our study illustrates that relying on administrators of specific sites to generate 
warnings about potentially harmful content is not sufficient protection for adolescents from 
concerning or inappropriate content. Few of the NSSI hashtags in our study generated 
Content Advisory warnings. Of note, Content Advisory warnings often provided links to 
resources about eating disorders which may be less helpful to teens who are solely engaging 
in NSSI such as cutting.
Limitations of this study include the focus on a single search term, #selfharmmm, which was 
selected based on its popularity as a portal into an online NSSI community. Our results do 
not document the full landscape of NSSI-related content that is likely available on 
Instagram, nor do they represent the larger community of NSSI across other social media 
sites. Findings are also limited by the results representing current NSSI and associated 
mental health concerns. The world of adolescent slang is not a static one, and terms change 
over time. We report on one structured assessment protocol that yielded consistent results, 
although we recognize that other sites and approaches that are systematic may also yield 
accurate and reliable findings. Our study did not assess or record demographic information 
of users; demographic information is not consistently available on Instagram profiles. IRB 
restrictions prohibited our recording or reporting any potentially identifiable information. 
Recent data suggest that most Instagram users are adolescents and young adults [38,39]; 
thus, our study population was likely mostly adolescents. Finally, our area of interest for this 
study was NSSI; thus, we excluded eating disorder and substance use hashtags. Future 
studies may wish to apply a broader lens to NSSI-related content and include other health 
conditions.
Despite these limitations, our study has important implications. Findings suggest that 
Instagram is a social media site with NSSI content that is publicly viewable by any 
Instagram user. Findings support that Instagram warnings are not sufficient to protect teens 
from exposure to NSSI content. Thus, adolescents and their parents cannot rely on Instagram

 to screen potentially harmful content for them. Clinicians can provide guidance and 
resources to adolescents and their parents during clinic visits by suggesting that families 
have routine check-ins about what the teen has viewed online, or recommending an online 
resource such as Commonsense Media or the American Academy of Pediatrics Family 
Media Use Plan. The Healthy Internet Use Model [40] provides guidance about 
“boundaries” in adolescent Internet use to help teens learn to avoid and disentangle 
themselves, from inappropriate or unintended content. Parents, educators, and clinicians are 
valuable partners to collaboratively reinforce safety messages.
Sites such Instagram with a high prevalence of teen users should consider improving their 
Content Advisory resources. Most of the redirect resources were focused on eating 
disorders; innovative opportunities exist for Instagram to redirect users to sites providing 
resources for people struggling with NSSI. Other social media sites have performed this 
successfully for more extreme self-harm concerns; Facebook recently added pop-up 
messages on concerning content related to suicidal ideation [41].
Clinicians who care for adolescents with NSSI may find it useful to ask patients about their 
engagement in online NSSI communities. A previous study described online NSSI content 
as a trigger for offline NSSI behaviors [12]. Conversations with patients exploring how they 
feel when viewing or creating NSSI content may prove useful for identifying triggers and 
supports for each individual. Parents, educators, and clinicians should also feel empowered 
to use structured evaluations and triangulation of findings to unmask meaning from elusive 
terms if a teen's post is worrisome. Future research should consider whether recovery 
communities could be established and promoted on social media as an adjunct to ongoing 
treatment.

 Implications and Contribution
This study evaluated ambiguous self-harm hashtags on Instagram. We found that NSSI 
hashtags were popular and content advisory warnings were unreliable. Findings suggest 
that opportunities exist for social media sites to better calibrate content advisory 
messages and resources and for parents and clinicians to discuss safety strategies with 
teens.
