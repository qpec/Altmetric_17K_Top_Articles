Abstract: Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is a rare and severe variant of psoriasis vulgaris, 
with an estimated prevalence of 1%–2.25% among psoriatic patients. The condition presents 
with distinct histopathologic and clinical findings, which include a generalized inflammatory 
erythema involving at least 75% of the body surface area. The pathogenesis of EP is not well 
understood; however, several studies suggest that the disease is associated with a predominantly 
T helper 2 (Th2) phenotype. Given the morbidity and potential mortality associated with the 
condition, there is a need for a better understanding of its pathophysiology. The management 
of EP begins with a comprehensive assessment of the patient’s presentation and often requires 
multidisciplinary supportive measures. In 2010, the medical board of the US National Psoriasis 
Foundation published consensus guidelines advocating the use of cyclosporine or infliximab 
as first-line therapy in unstable cases, with acitretin and methotrexate reserved for more stable 
cases. Since the time of that publication, additional information regarding the efficacy of newer 
agents has emerged. We review the latest data with regard to the treatment of EP
, which includes 
biologic therapies such as ustekinumab and ixekizumab.

Introduction
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition affecting roughly 2% of the popula-
tion.1 Erythrodermic psoriasis (EP) is a rare and severe variant of the disease, with an 
estimated prevalence among psoriatic patients ranging from 1%–2.25%.2 Furthermore, 
psoriatic erythroderma is the most common cause of erythroderma, responsible for 
~25% of all cases.2,3 Although the class I antigens HLA-Cw6, HLA-B57, HLA-B13, 
and HLA-B17 have been associated with psoriasis vulgaris (PV) and IL36RN mutations 
have been associated with pustular psoriasis, very little is known about the genetic basis 
of EP
.4,5 A recent retrospective epidemiological study in 60 patients with EP revealed a 
3:1 male-to-female ratio, an average age of 53.7 years, a positive history of psoriasis in 
78% of cases, an identifiable trigger factor in 53% of cases, a need for systemic therapy 
in 55% of cases, clinical improvement in 69.4% of cases, disease recurrence in 15% 
of cases, and finally three cases of septicemia and one case of stroke.6 The average 
age of onset and male-to-female ratio reported in this study corroborated those of an 
older epidemiological study reporting on 50 patients with EP

Clinical features and presentation
EP presents with generalized cutaneous findings such as erythema, edema, pruritus, 
ill-defined psoriatic plaques, scaling, hair loss, and occasionally exudative lesions and

palmoplantar or diffuse desquamation.7–9 Nail changes are 
very common to EP and can range from mild pitting to severe 
onychodystrophy, more commonly involving the fingernails 
than the toenails.2,8,10 In addition, patients can have systemic 
symptoms of fever, tachycardia, fatigue, malaise, chills, dehy-
dration, lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, myalgia, insomnia, 
sweats, diarrhea, constipation, weight changes, allodynia, 
and rarely high output heart failure (due to excessive water 
loss and edema) and cachexia.8,11,12 Laboratory results may 
show massive protein and fluid loss, leukocytosis, anemia, 
elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation 
rate, electrolyte abnormalities, temperature irregularities 
(hypothermia or hyperthermia), and rarely abnormal liver 
function tests.2,13,14
To clinically diagnose EP
, many authors suggest that there 
must be generalized inflammatory erythema, with or without 
exfoliation, involving at least 75% of the body surface area. 
Other authors argue that at least 90% of the body surface area 
must be affected.7,8,11 If clinical suspicion is high, the diag-
nosis can be confirmed with histologic analysis of EP
, which 
demonstrates an epidermal perivascular infiltrate of lympho-
cytes and eosinophils, dilated capillaries, and hyperkeratosis. 
Additional histological features of EP include some features 
of classical psoriasis, including parakeratosis, acanthosis, 
spongiosis, Munro micro-abscesses, and occasional apoptotic 
keratinocytes.13,15,16 However, due to exfoliation and loss of 
the epidermal stratum corneum in EP
, Munro micro-abscesses 
and parakeratosis may not be prominent histologically.13 
Furthermore, in order to confirm a diagnosis of EP
, clinicians 
must rule out other plausible causes of erythroderma such 
as atopic dermatitis, pityriasis rubra pilaris, drug eruptions, 
contact dermatitis, seborrheic dermatitis, immunobullous 
disorders, connective tissue disorders, and Sezary syndrome 
and other malignancies.8,13,17
Although the aforementioned parameters are sufficient 
to make a diagnosis of EP
, it is important to note that the 
disease can be categorized further into two general clini-
cal subtypes. The first is characterized by the presence of 
psoriatic plaques with gradual additional development of 
a generalized erythroderma in which the psoriatic plaques 
remain differentiable from the erythroderma. The disease 
course is relatively stable and prognosis is favorable in this 
form of EP
. The second subtype, which is more commonly 
seen in the setting of psoriatic arthritis, is often characterized 
by rapid whole body erythema and lack of demarcated pso-
riatic plaques. The disease course is relatively unstable and 
is more likely to be associated with abnormal vital signs and 
laboratory values. Accordingly, prognosis is not as favorable 
and there is appreciable mortality. The first clinical subtype is 
often associated with a more chronic and prolonged course, 
while the second subtype is more likely to be acute, rapidly 
progressive, and relapsing.11,18
Other rare types of EP include congenital EP and EP 
secondary to an environmental trigger (Table 1).19–21 Docu-
mented environmental triggers include sunburn, skin trauma, 
emotional stress, alcoholism, systemic illness, drug exposure, 
chemical exposure (such as to computed tomography contrast 
material or topical tar), and rapid withdrawal from medica-
tions known as the rebound phenomenon.11,13,14 Common 
antipsoriatic medications that may lead to the rebound phe-
nomenon include topical and oral steroids, efalizumab, and 
methotrexate.11,22,23 Systemic illnesses that have been known 
to trigger EP include human immunodeficiency virus, leuke-
mia, T-cell lymphoma, and gout.11,24,25 Finally, pharmaceutical 
drugs that have been reported in the literature to trigger EP 
include acitretin, etretinate, infliximab, lithium, antimalarials, 
and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.10,26,27
Because there is such a large list of possible EP triggers, 
it is sometimes difficult to differentiate the trigger from 
post-EP-related comorbidities. Therefore, it is important 
to be aware that EP patients commonly acquire superinfec-
tions of the skin and blood with Staphylococcus aureus and 
Group A Streptococcus that may lead an unaware clinician to 
conclude that the infection was a trigger to the EP
.8,12 Due to 
a defective skin barrier, EP patients can present with severe 
cellulitis, erysipelas, and sepsis.12,13 Other complications 
include pneumonia, endocarditis, and osteomyelitis.8,14
Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of EP is yet to be fully understood compared 
to classic PV (Table 2).11 The pathogenesis of PV is known 
to derive from abnormal interactions between T-lymphocytes, 
dendritic cells, keratinocytes, neutrophils, and proinflam-
matory cytokines, leading to activation of the Th17 and Th1 
immune axes.28 In contrast, the paucity of information regard-
ing EP has led us to rely on hints of information derived from 
smaller studies such as case reports, case series, and a small 
number of studies comparing EP patients to PV patients and 
healthy controls. In 2005, scientists demonstrated a statisti-
cally significant increase in serum immunoglobulin E in EP 
compared to PV patients. This disparity was attributed to a 
Th1/Th2 imbalance in favor of Th2 differentiation.29 A more 
recent study involving 16 EP patients furthered the notion 
that EP is characterized by a bias toward the Th2 program. 
This study uncovered three important discoveries regarding 
the pathogenesis of EP: first, that the ratio of Th1/Th2 was

levels of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 were significantly 
higher in EP patients than both PV and healthy patients; and 
finally, ratios of interferon (IFN)-γ/IL-4 and T-box expressed 
in T-cells/GATA-binding protein-3 (GATA-3) in EP patients 
were both <1.0, representing a reversal when compared with 
the other two groups. Higher levels of transcription factor 
GATA-3 – a key regulator of Th2 development from naïve Th 
cells – and IL-4 – a signature Th2 cytokine – were indicative 
of Th2 predominance in EP patients. The authors also noted 
that compared to healthy controls, EP patients had higher 
serum levels of the Th1 cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2 as well as 
the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-10.30 Another study showed that 
the cytokine, chemokine, and angiogenic growth factor profile 
for severe psoriatic disease, including very severe plaque 
psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and EP
, was characterized by a 
significant increase in plasma levels of IL-4, IL-6, monocyte 
chemoattractant protein-1, platelet-derived growth factor-
bb, and vascular endothelial growth factor, whereas only EP 
patients had significantly increased IL-13 and macrophage 
inflammatory protein-1-beta compared to healthy controls.31 
These findings suggest that an increased Th2 response and 
grossly dysregulated angiogenic factors are features of EP
.
Interestingly, a previous study had shown that IL-4, 
the signature Th2-inducing cytokine, was safe and effec-
tive in the treatment of plaque-type psoriasis. The authors 
attributed its efficacy to the induction of the Th2 pathway 
in skin-infiltrating lymphocytes.32 The study was followed

by investigations demonstrating high levels of CD8+ T-cells 
during the erythrodermic stage versus high levels of IL-4 and 
IL-13 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells during the resolu-
tion stage of EP
, suggesting a shift toward Th2 cytokine pre-
dominance contributing to the resolution of severe psoriasis 
such as EP
.33 Accordingly, many psoriasis therapeutics are 
either directed against T-cells, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α), the IL-12/IL-23 axis, or redirect cellular immune 
responses into a protective IL-4-dominated Th2 phenotype.34 
Considering all studies together, it remains to be clarified 
whether the Th2 phenotype seen in EP is associated with 
disease promotion or with a feedback response resulting in 
resolution of the disease.
Given their established importance in PV
, the contribu-
tion of Th17 cells to EP pathogenesis has also recently been 
investigated. Th17 cells secrete IL-17, IL-22, and IFN-γ, 
inducing production of inflammatory chemokines by T-cells, 
dendritic cells, and neutrophils.35 Using immunohistochemi-
cal  
analysis, Moy et al found Th17 to be the most  
predominant 
T-cell subset after Th2 in EP lesions. The authors also 
observed significant immunologic overlap of Th17 cells in 
EP and erythrodermic atopic dermatitis.36
At a molecular level, TNF-α has been shown to be overex-
pressed in plaque psoriatic lesions. It has been suggested that 
rapid systemic release of TNF-α in EP may be responsible for 
disease onset and severity.37 It is also suspected that the pres-
ence of circulating adhesion molecules, such as intercellular 
adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and 
E-selectin, may contribute to the immunosuppressed state in 
EP due to interference with normal cellular adhesion mecha-
nisms required for immune responses.38 EP has additionally 
been associated with a dermatogenic enteropathy leading to 
hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia, both of which may 
be exacerbated by excess calcium and phosphate excretion 
through the skin during EP flares.39
Management of EP
General considerations
Initial management of EP must include correction of any 
fluid, protein, and electrolyte abnormalities; a nutritional 
assessment; prophylaxis against hypothermia; and  
treatment 
of any secondary infections. Sepsis caused by skin pathogens, 
most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, is a particularly 
severe and potentially fatal complication that has been 
reported.2,6,40
In 2010, the medical board of the US National Psoriasis 
Foundation published consensus guidelines regarding the 
appropriate management of EP once initial stabilizing 
measures have been undertaken. They advocate the use of 
cyclosporine or infliximab as first-line therapy in acute and 
unstable cases. For more stable cases, on the other hand, 
acitretin and methotrexate are the preferred agents. Second-
line options include etanercept and combination therapy.8 
However, since the time of that publication, additional 
information regarding the efficacy of newer agents has 
emerged. Later, we review the latest data with regard to the 
treatment of EP
.
T
opical therapy
With the development of more potent and targeted therapies, 
the use of topicals in EP has become less common. Neverthe-
less, they may be helpful for nontoxic patients or as adjunct 
therapy for recalcitrant lesions in more severe disease.13,34 
In these cases, use of medium potency topical steroids under 
occlusive dressing, colloidal oatmeal baths, topical emol-
lients, topical vitamin D analogs, and various combinations 
of the aforementioned has been reported in the literature. 
Of note, coal tar is generally not recommended during the 
acute phase of EP given its ability to cause substantial skin 
irritation that may result in Koebner’s phenomenon.41
Topical steroids
A case series of two patients treated with twice-daily topi-
cal betamethasone dipropionate ointment, colloidal oatmeal 
baths, and total body occlusion reported significant skin 
clearing within three to four hospital days. Both patients had 
>80% body surface area involvement with unstable vitals 
and laboratory abnormalities on admission.42 Steroids are 
often used as a temporizing or adjunctive measure while an 
alternative treatment is introduced.13 For instance, clobetasol 
0.05% for body and desonide 0.05% for face have been used 
successfully in combination with methotrexate in a severe 
patient requiring intensive care unit hospitalization.43
Topical vitamin D analogs
The vitamin D analogs comprise a rising first-line therapy for 
mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis given their ability to abro-
gate skin cell proliferation, enhance skin cell  
differentiation, 
and modulate immunologic factors that are involved in dis-
ease etiology.44,45 Calcipotriol and calcitriol generally should 
not be used for situations in which patients have a high risk 
of systemic absorption, such as in severe EP
.41 Nevertheless, 
two groups effectively incorporated a vitamin D analog as 
one arm of a combination therapy to treat erythrodermic 
manifestations. van der Vleuten et al performed a left/right 
comparison study in a patient who presented with recalcitrant

EP: pathophysiology and current treatment
EP that had failed treatment with methotrexate, topical ste-
roids, and acitretin. Calcipotriol application was begun only 
after a minor improvement had been achieved with 5 mg/kg/d 
of cyclosporine. The authors noted a rapid and significant 
improvement on the side of the patient’s body treated with 
the vitamin D analog. The whole body was then treated with 
100 g/wk of calcipotriol in conjunction with low-dose ultra-
violet B, leading to marked improvement in 4 weeks.46 As an 
alternative combination therapy, the literature also supports 
the use of calcipotriene with adalimumab.47
Phototherapy
Phototherapy is an effective, first-line treatment for moderate-
to-severe plaque psoriasis that works by inhibiting kerati-
nocyte proliferation, promoting keratinocyte apoptosis, and 
dampening the inflammatory Th1 and Th17 pathways.48 The 
use of phototherapy in acute, fulminant EP is discouraged 
given the risk of koebernization.13 However, phototherapy can 
play a role in long-term management of EP once the disease 
course becomes more stable.8 One case report supports the 
use of low-dose ultraviolet B in combination with local calci-
potriol for long-term maintenance therapy of EP
.46 It has also 
been suggested that phototherapy can be a helpful adjunct in 
instances where EP is refractory to acitretin monotherapy.49
Systemic agents
Second-generation retinoids
Etretinate and its active metabolite, acitretin, are effective 
systemic treatments for moderate-to-severe psoriasis and 
other hyperkeratotic disorders (Table 3). They function to 
normalize keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, 
regulate sebaceous gland activity, and modulate local inflam-
matory responses.50 Side effects are dose-dependent and 
include skin desquamation, cheilitis, xerosis, pruritus, and 
hair loss.27 Retinoids are also known to be potent teratogens; 
therefore, the use of these agents in women of childbearing 
potential is heavily regulated.51
According to expert consensus, acitretin is considered a 
high-priority agent for stable cases of EP as it has a relatively 
slower onset of action.8 Koo52 describes a sequential therapy 
for EP in which patients are started on 25 mg/d of acitretin, 
which can then be increased by 10–25 mg every 2–4 weeks 
until the maximally tolerated dose is reached.
A meta-analysis of 12 patients receiving 25–35 mg/d 
of acitretin noted clinical remission or significant improve-
ment of EP in 83.3% of cases.53 Polat and Sereflican found 
50 mg/d of acitretin to be similarly effective in one patient 
with concomitant EP and elephantiasis nostras verrucosa. 
After 1 month of treatment, the patient had near-complete 
resolution of his lesions and remained clear at 2-month 
follow-up.54 However, a 4-month trial of acitretin at the same 
dose in another patient failed to produce any clinical improve-
ment. It is important to note, though, that this patient was 
significantly overweight and may have been underdosed.55
The second-generation retinoids have also been used in 
combination with other systemic agents, such as cyclosporine 
and infliximab. Three patients treated with 0.5–0.8 mg/kg/d of 
etretinate and 3–4 mg/kg/d of cyclosporine experienced sig-
nificant disease resolution within a few weeks.56 The acitre-
tin/cyclosporine combination was ineffective in four other 
patients, although in one of the cases, the maximum daily 
dose of acitretin was only 20 mg.46,57 In addition, a case series 
examining acitretin/infliximab reported >90% improvement 
of erythrodermic manifestations in four patients.58
Interestingly, there are also case reports describing 
acitretin- and etretinate-induced EP, which ultimately 
resolved after the drug was discontinued and replaced with 
cyclosporine.27,59,60 It is unclear why the retinoids provoked 
erythroderma in these cases. Systemic retinoids have also 
exhibited reduced efficacy in the context of low serum 
albumin levels as it is thought that transport proteins such 
as albumin are necessary for the migration of acitretin into 
peripheral tissues.61
Methotrexate
Methotrexate is an immunosuppressive drug that inhibits the 
enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. Oral systemic therapy with 
methotrexate is a first-line option for patients with plaque

acitretin, methotrexate also has a slower onset of action and 
is considered a high-priority agent for more stable cases of

methotrexate may increase the risk of hepatotoxicity, hepatic 
fibrosis, and bone marrow suppression.62
A retrospective analysis of 21 patients with severe psoria-
sis or EP treated with an initial dose of 5–7.5 mg/wk reported 
complete remission in 62% of cases and partial remission in 
28.5% of cases. Mean remission period lasted 14 months.63 
Several case reports also describe EP resolution within 
3 weeks to 3 months using the same dosing range. One of 
these patients was even continued on maintenance therapy 
for 2 years with lasting remission.10,19,64
Three retrospective studies totaling 53 patients investigat-
ing 15–40 mg/wk of methotrexate reported good-to-excellent 
responses in 43 patients (81%), moderate responses in seven 
patients (13%), and poor responses in three patients (6%).65–67 
Two case reports also support the use of 15 mg/wk in patients 
presenting with diffuse EP
. Both patients began to experience 
significant skin clearing within a few weeks. Notably, one 
patient was also receiving concomitant compound glycyrrhi-
zin, an agent that is thought to block production of IL-8.43,68 
Methotrexate has been combined with several other agents 
for the treatment of EP
, including with infliximab55,69–71; with 
etretinate reporting satisfactory results72; and with cyclospo-
rine or etanercept reporting excellent results.64,73
Cyclosporine
Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive agent that blocks IL-2 
transcription, thereby impairing the growth and activity of 
T-cells. Cyclosporine is approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis 
in immunocompetent adults.74 Given its rapid onset of action, 
cyclosporine is considered a critical first-line drug for the 
control of unstable cases of EP
. More severe disease often 
requires a starting dose of 5 mg/kg/d. Case series and reports 
advocate the use of cyclosporine in the treatment of EP at 
doses of 1.5–5 mg/kg/d for 2 weeks to 4 months.12,24,26,27,75,76 
The largest case series (n=33) described complete disease 
remission in 67% of patients after 3 months and an overall 
response rate of 94%.24 Cyclosporine can also be used in 
combination with topical or systemic agents, such as acitre-
tin and etretinate, in order to reduce the dose, duration, and 
adverse effects of each individual agent.46,56,57 At the time of 
EP remission (total resolution of skin lesions), cyclosporine 
can slowly be tapered by 0.5 mg/kg every 2 weeks until 
total discontinuation or reappearance of signs of disease.12,24 
Nephrotoxicity is the most significant potential side effect of 
cyclosporine; therefore, a >30% elevation of serum creatinine 
must prompt a reduction in dose or cessation of therapy.
Mycophenolate mofetil
Mycophenolate mofetil is another immune suppressant that 
selectively inhibits activated lymphocytes. It has efficacy as a 
monotherapy for moderate-to-severe psoriasis in several case 
reports, small clinical studies, and a randomized controlled 
trial.77–80 Use of mycophenolate mofetil in two patients with 
severe EP has also been reported in the literature. Over a 
6-week period, both patients experienced 70% skin improve-
ment with no notable side effects or disease relapse after drug 
cessation.78 Of note, mycophenolate mofetil is teratogenic 
and should not be used during pregnancy.
Biologics
Biologic therapy encompasses an emerging category of 
drugs that target specific cytokines of the immune system. 
Given their enhanced selectivity, these agents are a promising 
alternative to the conventional immunosuppressants, such as 
methotrexate and cyclosporine. Certain categories of biolog-
ics have been adopted for the treatment of EP
, including the 
TNF-α inhibitors, IL-12/IL-23 inhibitors, and most recently, 
the IL-17A inhibitors (Table 4).
Baseline screening prior to beginning treatment with a 
biologic includes a tuberculin skin test or IFN-γ-release assay 
for tuberculosis (QuantiFERON Gold), updated immuniza-
tions, hepatitis B and C and human immunodeficiency virus 
tests, and basic blood and chemistry laboratories including 
liver function tests.81
TNF-α inhibitors
Etanercept
Etanercept is a soluble TNF-receptor fusion protein that 
acts as a decoy for endogenous TNF-α. This interaction 
inhibits the biological inflammatory cascade of TNF-α. 
Etanercept is administered subcutaneously once to twice 
weekly  
(maximum individual dose of 50 mg). A case series 
following ten patients with EP reported that eight of ten 
patients (80%) attained PASI50 (50% or greater reduction of 
the psoriasis area and severity index) and five patients (50%) 
reached PASI75 at 12 weeks. At the end of the 24 weeks, six 
of the total ten patients (60%) had achieved and maintained 
PASI75.82 A multicenter retrospective study provided six 
further cases of EP treated with etanercept, with four of six 
(67%) achieving PASI75 between weeks 12 and 14. Clear-
ance, defined as PASI90, was obtained in two of six (33.3%)

EP: pathophysiology and current treatment
cases with a mean delay of 16 weeks.7 Two individual case 
reports additionally support long-term management of EP 
using etanercept monotherapy with excellent responses.83,84
Etanercept has also been used concomitantly with metho-
trexate in a pediatric patient presenting with recalcitrant EP
. 
Her erythrodermic manifestations gradually subsided over a 
3-month period and were not noted to reappear throughout 
2-year follow-up.64
Adalimumab
Adalimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against 
TNF-α. It is administered subcutaneously at an initial dose of 
80 mg at week 0, followed by 40 mg every other week start-
ing at week 1.85 Two case reports, as well as one multicenter, 
retrospective study, support the use of adalimumab in EP
. The 
multicenter study reported that 50% of the subjects had a 
75% reduction in PASI score from baseline by 12–14 weeks 
after treatment onset.7 Mumoli et al47 similarly observed sig-
nificant disease remission in a patient who was treated with 
adalimumab for 12 weeks. Lastly, a complicated EP patient 
with concomitant hepatitis C virus infection and hemophilia 
remarkably achieved remission at week 3 of treatment with 
adalimumab.9 Interestingly, several patients who were treat-
ment resistant to adalimumab and other anti-TNF-α agents 
had eventual success with ustekinumab.17,55,86–88
Infliximab
Infliximab is a chimeric anti-TNF-α monoclonal antibody that 
interacts with both soluble and membrane-bound  
TNF-α. This 
interaction results in decreased epidermal T-cell infiltration. 
For the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis, 5 mg/kg is admin-
istered intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, with maintenance 
dosing every 8 weeks thereafter.89 Given its route of admin-
istration, infliximab has a relatively quick onset of action 
that is comparable to that of cyclosporine. Therefore, expert 
consensus considers the drug an additional first-line option for 
unstable cases of EP
. Several case reports and series, as well 
as one multicenter clinical trial, support the use of infliximab 
as a monotherapy in EP
. Together, these studies describe 52 
patients, with 34 (65%) exhibiting significant improvement 
as defined by at least a 50% reduction in PASI score from 
baseline7,58,90,91 or by a physician’
s global assessment of “clear” 
or “almost clear”.92–96 Infliximab has also successfully been 
combined with other systemic agents, such as methotrexate 
and acitretin, with excellent clinical results.58,69,70,97
However, a couple of case reports suggest that infliximab 
may lose efficacy after successive infusions. In these patients, 
no further reduction in PASI was appreciated after 14 weeks 
and 30 weeks of treatment.84,87 It is thought that this phenom-
enon may occur due to development of anti-infliximab antibod-
ies. Interestingly, it has also been suggested that development 
of antinuclear antibodies and anti-double-stranded DNA anti-
bodies on anti-TNF-α treatment may signal forthcoming treat-
ment failure.88 Larger and longer term clinical trials may help 
decide whether surveillance for these antibodies is warranted.
Golimumab
Golimumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody against 
TNF-α and is available for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.98 
One case report regarding the use of golimumab in EP has 
been published. The patient was given 50 mg subcutaneously 
per month and by the third injection had an 82% reduction 
in PASI score. He was continued on therapy for >11 months 
and maintained his achieved results. No significant adverse 
events were reported throughout the duration of therapy.37
IL-12/23 inhibitors
Ustekinumab
Ustekinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that 
binds the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23. These two 
cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis 
by stimulating the Th1 and Th17 inflammatory pathways, 
respectively. Ustekinumab is approved for the treatment of 
moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis 
and is administered subcutaneously. Appropriate dosing is 
45 mg for individuals weighing <100 kg and 90 mg for indi-
viduals weighing ≥100 kg. The injections are administered 
at weeks 0 and 4 and then every 12 weeks thereafter.99 The

published literature regarding the efficacy of ustekinumab in 
EP includes two multicenter retrospective studies,7,17 three 
case series,23,86,88 and three case reports.55,87,100 Together, 
the studies comprise a total of 40 patients, with 32 (80%) 
experiencing clinical improvement, as defined by a 75% 
reduction in PASI score from baseline. The earliest clinical 
improvements in these studies were seen after just 4 weeks 
of treatment (45% of cases). As mentioned in the section 
on adalimumab, several patients with relcacitrant EP that 
had failed treatment with other agents, including numerous 
forms of anti-TNF-α therapy, had eventual success with 
ustekinumab.17,55,86–88
IL-17 inhibitors
Ixekizumab
Ixekizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody 
that inhibits IL-17A, an inflammatory cytokine of the Th17 
pathway that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of 
psoriasis.101 Ixekizumab has been tested in Phase II and III 
clinical trials of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis, dem-
onstrating efficacy comparable to that of other biologics. 
The drug has also more recently been tested in a Phase III, 
multicenter, single-arm, open-label study of eight EP patients. 
All subjects received a 160 mg subcutaneous injection at 
week 0, 80 mg every 2 weeks through week 12, and 80 mg 
every 4 weeks through week 24. The authors reported that 
at week 12, eight patients (100.0%) achieved PASI75, five 
patients (62.5%) achieved PASI90, and two patients (25%) 
achieved PASI100.102
Other biologics
Panitumumab
Panitumumab is a human monoclonal antibody targeting 
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). A patient 
with recalcitrant EP who failed treatment with calcipotriol 
ointment, topical steroids, etretinate, and psoralen plus 
ultraviolet A showed dramatic improvement within 10 days 
of treatment with panitumumab. His achieved results lasted 
at least 6 months after the initiation of therapy.103 This case 
report suggests that EGFR signaling may contribute to 
the development of psoriatic skin lesions, and its role in the 
pathogenesis of EP could be further explored.
Alefacept and efalizumab
Alefacept and efalizumab are two biologics previously 
approved by the Food and Drug Administration for psoria-
sis that are no longer available. A case series following two 
patients has been published regarding the use of alefacept in 
EP
. Both patients had recalcitrant psoriasis that responded 
completely to a full course of alefacept. One of the patients 
achieved this response by 14 weeks, yet flared back to 
baseline 2 weeks after discontinuing treatment. The second 
patient was on a concomitant 13-week cyclosporine taper 
during which he maintained good results.104 Two patients 
treated with efalizumab as their first- and third-line biologic 
therapy, respectively, had no clinical benefit.7 On the other 
hand, one study in which efalizumab was administered at an 
initial subcutaneous weekly dose of 0.7 mg/kg followed by 
1 mg/kg for 6 months reported PASI75 achievement in an 
EP patient after 18 weeks of treatment.105
Discussion
EP is a rare and severe disorder that is distinct from PV
. 
Although the exact pathogenesis of EP is not fully understood, 
it is thought to involve a complex interplay of the Th1, Th2, 
and Th17 inflammatory pathways. Evidence suggests that in 
contrast to PV
, the Th1/Th2 imbalance of EP tends to favor 
Th2 differentiation and its related cytokines. IL-4 and IL-13, 
in particular, have been shown to be elevated in EP relative 
to both PV patients and healthy controls. Functional studies 
involving these cytokines may help clarify their roles in the 
pathogenesis of EP
. TNF-α is also an important player in the 
pathogenesis of EP especially given the documented efficacy 
of anti-TNF-α agents in disease treatment. Given the morbid-
ity and potential mortality associated with the condition, there 
is a need for a better understanding of EP pathophysiology.
The management of EP begins with a comprehensive 
assessment of the patient’
s presentation. Often patients require 
supportive measures that address electrolyte abnormalities, 
nutritional status, impaired thermoregulation, and underlying 
infection, among other things. Furthermore, potential septic 
and thromboembolic complications justify close surveillance 
of patients and often also hospitalization. Severe and unstable 
cases of EP benefit from rapidly acting agents, such as cyclo-
sporine and infliximab. Despite a comparably rapid onset of 
action, use of systemic steroids should be avoided given high 
risk of rebound after withdrawal. Although the most recent 
expert consensus only recommends acitretin and methotrexate 
as first-line therapies for stable cases, review of the literature 
suggests that ustekinumab may also be used in this role. Evi-
dence supporting the efficacy of ustekinumab comes from 40 
documented instances of EP in which the biologic was used as 
a monotherapy. Of these patients, 80% had a significant clinical 
response to treatment, while 45% began to exhibit improve-
ment in as early as 4 weeks. Furthermore, 75% of responders 
had recalcitrant EP who previously failed therapy with other

EP: pathophysiology and current treatment
agents, including the TNF-α inhibitors that were also reviewed 
in this article. Given its response profile, ustekinumab may rep-
resent a viable option for the long-term control of EP
. The anti-
TNF-α agents studied in EP include etanercept, adalimumab, 
infliximab, and golimumab. Infliximab is already accepted as 
a first-line systemic therapy for EP and has demonstrated its 
clinical efficacy in a large volume of patients; 65% of patients 
on infliximab had at least a 50% reduction in PASI score from 
baseline. Etanercept, adalimumab, and golimumab have all 
been employed in relatively fewer instances of EP but have also 
shown good clinical efficacy. In this regard, 67% of patients in 
the largest case series investigating etanercept in EP
, 50% of 
patients in the largest clinical study investigating adalimumab 
in EP
, and one EP patient who received golimumab were noted 
to have at least a 75% reduction in PASI score from baseline.
The other biologics reviewed in this article have been 
tested in far fewer EP patients. Ixekizumab has been inves-
tigated in eight subjects. Although results suggest that 
ixekizumab shows great therapeutic promise, further large-
scale and long-term trials are needed to establish safety 
and efficacy. Other anti-IL-17 agents such as secukinumab 
and brodalumab may therefore also represent experimental 
therapeutic options for EP
. Panitumumab, efalizumab, and 
alefacept were efficacious in 100% (one of one patient), 
33.3% (one of three patients), and 100% (two of two patients) 
of cases, respectively. The efficacy of panitumumab, an EGFR 
antagonist, alludes to a potential role that the EGFR may play 
in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Further studies may be war-
ranted to explore a possible pathophysiologic relationship. 
Regarding the remaining therapies reviewed in this article, 
topical steroids can be helpful adjuncts in both acute and 
later stages of EP
, whereas phototherapy may be useful in 
later stages once the disease course stabilizes.
Conclusion
The treatment options for EP have greatly expanded in the 
last several years. However, additional controlled trials with 
extended follow-ups are needed to better understand the 
pathophysiology of EP
, determine the exact role, safety, and 
efficacy of the new biologics in EP
, and reinform treatment 
guidelines.
