Abstract
Objective
The aim of this study was to compare the effects of 5-week high-intensity interval training
(HIIT) and moderate-to-vigorous intensity continuous training (MVCT) on cardiometabolic
health outcomes and enjoyment of exercise in obese young women.
Methods
A randomized controlled experiment was conducted that involved thirty-one obese females
(age range of 18–30) randomly assigned to either HIIT or MVCT five-week training pro-
grams. Participants in HIIT condition performed 20 min of repeated 8 s cycling interspersed
with 12 s rest intervals, and those in MVCT condition cycled continuously for 40 min at 60–
80% of peak oxygen consumption ( _
VO2peak), both for four days in a week. Outcomes such
as _
VO2peak, body composition estimated by bioimpedance analysis, blood lipids, and serum
sexual hormones were measured at pre-and post-training. The scores of Physical Activity
Enjoyment Scale (PAES) were collected during the intervention.
Results
After training, _
VO2peak increased significantly for both training programs (9.1% in HIIT and
10.3% in MVCT) (p = 0.010, η2 = 0.41). Although MVCT group had a significant reduction in
total body weight (TBW, −1.8%, p = 0.034), fat mass (FM, - 4.7%, p = 0.002) and percent-
age body fat (PBF, −2.9%, p = 0.016), there were no significant between-group differences

 in the change of the pre- and post-measures of these variables. The HIIT group had a higher
score on PAES than the MVCT group during the intervention. For both conditions, exercise
training led to a decline in resting testosterone and estradiol levels, but had no significant
effect on blood lipids.
Conclusion
Both HIIT and MVCT are effective in improving cardiorespiratory fitness and in reducing
sexual hormones in obese young women; however, HIIT is a more enjoyable and time-effi-
cient strategy. The mild-HIIT protocol seems to be useful for at least maintaining the body
weight among sedentary individuals.
Introduction
Overweight and obesity has become a serious public health problem worldwide. Currently,
more than 35% of men and close to 40% of women are overweight or obese [1]. Although
weight increase occurs for all ages in both developed and developing countries, such increase is
the most rapid for people between 20 and 40 years of age [2]. Overweight and obesity are asso-
ciated with lower level of life quality [3], and with cardiovascular disease, hyperlipidemia [4]
and cancer [5], while exercise-induced weight reduction improves cardiorespiratory fitness [6]
and lowers metabolic risk factors [6, 7]. The recommended exercise prescription for most
adults is typically a regular moderate-intensity continuous exercise program, with �30 min�d−1
on �5 d�wk−1 for a total of �150 min�wk−1 or an alternative of vigorous exercise for 75 min or
more per week, for improving and maintaining physical fitness and health [7]. However, the
inactive nature of sedentary individuals and the “lack of time” excuse tend to prevent people
from being engaged in regular physical activity [8].
Low cardiorespiratory fitness level is the most powerful predictor for developing cardiovas-
cular disease and the mortality induced by such disease [9]. An increasing amount of evidence
indicates that high-intensity intermittent/interval exercise training (HIIT) has positive effects
on cardiorespiratory fitness, obesity and the associated comorbidities [3, 10]. Although some
studies reported that protocols as short as two weeks in duration have resulted in marked incre-
ments in _
VO2max by 9% to 13% [10, 11], the results of interventions with durations ranging
from 2 to 6 weeks are inconsistent [12, 13].
Overweight and obesity may affect women’s health with irregular menstrual cycle and
abnormal sex hormone levels [5], as high levels of androgen and estradiol are observed in
obese young women [14]. Sex steroids hormones are involved in the preservation and expan-
sion of muscle mass [15], and are associated with the regulation of body fat distribution in both
men and women [14]. Androgen and estrogen have similar effects on lipid metabolism in that
higher levels of androgen and estrogen may increase lipolysis and may promote lipid oxidation
in animals [16] and in vitro [17]. Therefore, sex steroid hormones may play a supportive role
in body weight change.
Because the Wingate-based sprint interval training is exceptionally demanding, less rigorous
HIIT protocols have been developed for the sedentary individuals [18]. It has been reported
that training with 8s/12s work-rest intervals for 20 minutes for 15 weeks improved body fat dis-
tribution and insulin resistance of young women, when compared to 40 min of steady-state
exercise with the similar energy expenditure [3]. Nevertheless, HIIT is typically characterized
as a low-volume training program [19, 20], and theoretically, for the purpose of examining

 health benefits, there is no requirement that this exercise program should have the same energy
expenditure as the continuous training program. Additionally, in terms of the study designs for
fat loss induced by HIIT, there are some common flaws, such as the lack of quantitative estima-
tion of energy expenditure [21–24], and the neglect of the effects of other physical activities of
the participants besides the implemented exercise training program [3, 22–24].
Enjoyment is an important factor for long-term adherence. A constructed exercise program
should be perceived as enjoyable and be time efficient. If not, it is difficult to sustain the exer-
cise long enough to get the desired health outcomes. Although it has been reported that HIIT
seems to be more enjoyable than either continuous moderate-intensity exercise [25] or contin-
uous vigorous-intensity exercise (MVCT) [26], Foster et al (2015) reported that 8 weeks of the
Tabata protocol consisting of 20 s cycling at 170% _
VO2max with 10 s rest for eight sets was less
enjoyable than continuous training protocol of 20 minutes with an intensity at 90% ventilatory
threshold among untrained young adults [27]. As a consequence, there has been the argument
against the use of vigorous exercise as an alternative to traditional continuous exercise: vigor-
ous exercise is harder, and thus it could be a deterrent for the sedentary/obese population [8,
28]. Given that the current findings were based on samples of young active men [25] or normal
weight individuals [26], the question concerning whether the low-volume HIIT training is
more enjoyable than continuous training needs to be examined further in different popula-
tions, especially in overweight and obese subjects.
At present, it is not clear if HIIT has any additive physiological effects relative to MVCT. Up
to this time, in the studies that compared continuous exercise with HIIT in overweight and
obese individuals, the continuous exercise protocols typically had low to moderate exercise
intensity [20]. Given that, with the same exercise volume, higher exercise intensity is more
effective for improving aerobic capacity than lower exercise intensity [29], it is necessary to use
a higher-intensity exercise as the reference group in the comparison of the physiological differ-
ences between continuous training and HIIT. Few studies have examined the health related
outcomes between continuous training with moderate-to-vigorous intensity around 150 min-
utes per week and HIIT training for obese women, despite the fact that MVCT training has
been used for athletes [30], active individuals [31, 32], and sedentary individuals with normal
body weight [33]. Thus, whether HIIT exercise protocols would result in different effects on
cardiorespiratory fitness and metabolic indices when compared to MVCT exercise protocols
among overweight and obese individuals warrants further investigation.
Using a less demanding HIIT protocol with 60 repetitions of 8s/12s work-rest intervals at a
lower resistance for 4 days/week, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of
5-week HIIT and MVCT interventions on cardio-metabolic health outcomes, sex hormones
levels and physical activity enjoyment scale (PAES) in obese female subjects. It was hypothe-
sized that both HIIT and MVCT would lead to improvement in cardio-metabolic parameters,
including _
VO2peak, body weight and fat, blood lipids, and sexual hormones, and that different
training modes would have different effects on these health-related outcomes. Additionally, it
was hypothesized that the time-efficient HIIT would be a more enjoyable exercise mode in
comparison with MVCT.
Method
Subjects
A power analysis was conducted by G�Power Version 3.1 to justify the sample size. With a
power of 0.8 at α = 0.05, an assumed correlation of 0.8 between pre-treatment and post-treat-
ment, and an effect size of 0.32 based on a meta-analysis for the primary outcome of _

 resulting from high-intensity interval training [19], the sample size for HIIT group is estimated
to be 12. When a dropout rate of 20% is allowed, a total sample size of 30 subjects is needed.
Volunteers were publicly recruited through local advertisements to participate in the study
(Consort Flow Diagram, Fig 1), which was approved by the Panel on Research Ethics of the
University of Macau (S1 Protocol).
The inclusion criteria for the subjects were: in the age range of 18 to 35; being “sedentary” as
defined by reporting less than 60 minutes exercise every week in the previous 6 months; being
“obese” as defined as the percentage of body fat over 30% [34] measured by a 5-serial of fre-
quent bioimpedance analyzer (Biospace Inbody 720, South Korea), and with a doctor certificate
approving the practice of vigorous exercise. Each volunteer completed a PAR-Q form and a
menstrual cycle survey prior to being admitted into the study. Volunteers who could not par-
ticipate in strenuous physical exercise, smokers, alcoholics, and users of contraceptive pills or
prescribed drugs were excluded. A total of 31 qualified subjects were included. All subjects pro-
vided written informed consent before participation, and then subjects were randomly assigned
to either HIIT or MVCT group. By the end of the study, twenty-six subjects completed all the
testing procedure and training sessions.
Experimental protocol
The experimental protocol consisted of pre- and post-training measurements and a 5-week
HIIT or MVCT intervention. Measures of _
VO2peak, body composition and blood assays were

 taken in pre- and post-training measurements. Baseline measures were taken within 96 h and
144 h before the 5-week exercise intervention, and post-training measures were taken between
72 h and 120 h following the last training session. For each subject, both pre- and post-training
measures were taken either in the follicular phase or in the late luteal phase, based on the self-
reported menstrual cycle survey. During both the testing and training sessions, the same verbal
encouragement was given by the same assistants.
Blood sampling
Blood samples were taken from the cubital veins at pre- and post-training after a minimum of
a 12 h overnight fast. After clotting for 1 hour at room temperature, the samples were centri-
fuged at 3000 rpm for 10 min and then serum supernatants were removed and frozen at– 80°C
for later analysis.
Body composition analysis
Height and weight were determined using standard conventional methods (in light clothing
and no footwear) with a stadiometer and an electronic scale respectively, and body mass index
(BMI, in kg/m2) was calculated by weight divided by square height. Body composition was
assessed in a fasting state at baseline and approximately 72 h following the last training session.

O2peak test
_
VO2peak test was carried out on a computer-controlled ergometer (Monark 839E, Sweden)
both at baseline and at least 72 h following the last training session. After a 2 min cycling
warm-up at 30 W, graded exercise started at the initial workload of 50 W and increased by
25 W every 3 min till completion. Each subject was asked to maintain the cycling speed of
60 ± 5 rpm until she either reached the criteria described below or reached the stage of voli-
tional exhaustion. _
VO2peak was assessed continuously using a pre-calibrated breath-by-breath
analysis system (Meta-Max 3B, Cortex Biophysik GmbH, Leipzig, Germany). The test termi-
nated when the subjects met any two of the following criteria: _
VO2 reached a plateau with a
change less than 150 mL�min−1; heart rate reached age-predicted maximal level (220-age);
respiratory exchange ratio (RER) � 1.10, and rating of perceived exertion (Borg’s) scale
reached 18 [21]. After the test, there was a 5-min recovery at 30 W _
VO2peak was determined as
the highest average _
VO2 value maintained for one minute.
High-intensity interval exercise training protocol
The HIIT cycling protocol was similar to that used in a previous study by Trapp et al [3].
Briefly, after a 3-min warm-up at 50 W, each participant followed a prerecorded tape to con-
duct 8 s of sprinting and 12 s of passive rest for a maximum of 60 repetitions on an ergometer
(Monark 874E, Sweden). The initial resistance was 1.0 kg and subjects worked as hard as they
could during the sprinting phase. The resistance would be increased by 0.5 kg increment once
an individual could complete two consecutive 20-min intermittent sprinting exercise sessions
at the given intensity level. Subjects reduced their workload at the end of this conditioning
phase and cooled down for 3 min at 50 W followed by standard stretches. Heart rate (HR,
Polar F4M BLK, Finland), the Borg 6–20 ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and training
power were recorded before and after every five sprints, and enjoyment of exercise was assessed
by PAES scale [35] immediately after every training session. When an individual missed a ses-
sion, she would be asked to make it up later so that 20 HIIT sessions were completed within
5 weeks.

 Moderate-to-vigorous intensity continuous exercise training protocol
For MVCT training [3], each subject seated on an ergocycle (Ergometer 900PC, Ergoline, Ger-
many) to start a 3-min warm-up at 50 W, and continued to exercise at an initial workload of
60% _
VO2peak of the pre-training test for 40 min with a rhythm at 60 ± 5 rpm. After every train-
ing session, similar to the HIIT group, there was a 3-min cool-down and stretching period.
Once an individual had completed two consecutive exercise sessions at the specified level of
exercise intensity, resistance was increased by 0.5 kg until she reached the level of 80% _
VO2peak
of the pre-training test. HR, RPE and training power were recorded every 5 min during the
exercise training, PAES scores were assessed in the same way as for the HIIT group.
Training intensity and energy expenditure during training
In terms of training intensity, the actual values of intensity were the mean of _
VO2 measured in
the first and last session in HIIT group, and the average value of _
VO2 determined in all 20 ses-
sions in MVCT group, respectively. The exercise intensity in all subjects of MVCT reached the
required 80% _
VO2peak after two weeks of exercise training. Energy expenditure of HIIT was
assessed as the mean of these two sessions, and the data was used to evaluate energy expendi-
ture for the 5 weeks of HIIT, while energy expenditure for the MVCT group was estimated by
converting the workload for each session into oxygen consumption [3, 36].
Record of diet and extra physical activity
In order to ensure that the effect of the exercise intervention was not counteracted in some way
by other co-concurring events, subjects were instructed to maintain their normal diet and nor-
mal daily physical activities throughout the training program. Food intake data were recorded
by using a 3-day diet recall protocol (two weekdays and one weekend day) during three weeks:
one week before the intervention, the third week of the intervention, and the last week of the
intervention. Energy intake and diet components were analyzed by using the nutrition analysis
and management system for athletes and the general public (NRISM Version 3.1), and the
analyses were conducted by the Sports Nutrition Research Center, National Institute of Sports
Medicine, China. Daily physical activities were monitored by using a pedometer (Yamax SW-
200 digiwalker, Japan) on three days (two weekdays and one weekend day) in every week dur-
ing the 5-week training period.
Measures of blood lipids and sexual hormones
Serum lipids, including high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG), were measured by
using an automatic biochemical analyzer (Olympus AU400, Japan). The intra-assay coeffi-
cients of variation (CV) for blood lipid assays were all within 5%. Concentrations of serum
testosterone and estradiol were analyzed by using the commercially available electrochemilu-
minescence immunoassay kits (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany). The lower
detection limits and intra-assay CVs were 0.025 ng�ml-1 and 4.5% for testosterone, and 5
pg�ml-1 and 4.8% for estradiol. All analyses were tested in the same assay with standard proce-
dures (Deyi Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China).
Statistical analysis
Data analysis was conducted by PASW software (Release 22.0; IBM, New York, USA). Prior to
the planned statistical analyses, preliminary analysis was conducted (Kolmogorov-Smirnov

 test) to confirm data distribution normality. Once it was confirmed that the sample data satis-
fied the normality assumption, statistical analyses relevant for our main research interest were
conducted. A two-way mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated measures was used
to test the main effect (i.e., group effect) and the interaction effect (time and group interaction)
on the outcome variables. For within–group change from pre- and post-values of the relevant
outcome variables of interest, paired-sample t-test was performed to test the difference in pre-
and post-measures. Change between the pre- and post-measures was calculated for each out-
come variable of interest. Once the effect of intervention was shown to be statistically signifi-
cant, ANCOVA with the baseline value as covariate was performed to determine the difference
of the change between the two groups. Pearson-product moment correlation coefficients were
computed to examine the relationships between the cardio-metabolic health outcomes and sex-
ual hormones. As effect size measure of the main effect and the interaction effect, partial η2
was considered small if η2<0.06, and large if η2 >0.14 [37]. All experimental data are presented
as means ± standard deviation (SD). A p value of < 0.05 was used as the criterion for statistical
significance.
Results
Training data
Weekly training time spent in HIIT was less than half of the time in MVCT (66 ± 4 min in
HIIT group vs. 148 ± 12 min in MVCT group (p = 0.000), and the former had lower RPE than
the latter (p = 0.035). The ratio of training HR and HRmax as determined at _
VO2peak test in
HIIT tended to be higher than that of MVCT (p = 0.072), despite similar training HR in the
two intervention conditions. In terms of % _
VO2peak during the training sessions, HIIT group
maintained a mean level of 80 ± 7% _
VO2peak while MVCT group maintained the level of
71 ± 8% _
VO2peak (p = 0.000). Over the 5-week training period, the total estimated energy
expenditure in MVCT group was twice as much as that in HIIT group (p = 0.000) (Table 1).
Diet and extra physical activities
There were no within- and between-group differences in daily energy intake and physical activ-
ity at pre-, during-, and post-intervention times (p > 0.05) (Daily energy intake and physical

 Blood lipids and sexual hormones
There were no significant differences in blood lipid profiles between pre- and post-training
measures (p > 0.05). Serum testosterone tended to be significantly lower (p = 0.071, η2 = 0.14)
and estrogen decreased significantly (p = 0.035, η2 = 0.19) after training intervention (Table 2).
No group differences were found in these two sexual hormones (Table 3).
Physical activity enjoyment scale (PAES) during the intervention
HIIT group had significantly higher scores on PAES than the MVCT group in any of the 5
weeks during the exercise intervention (Physical activity enjoyment scale, Fig 3).
Correlations between variables
No significant correlations were found between the variables among _
VO2peak, body composi-
tion, blood lipids and sexual hormones. However, there were moderate correlations between
the total energy expenditure and body weight (r = -0.55, p = 0.005), BMI (r = -0.55, p = 0.005),
fat mass (r = -0.54, p = 0.007) and PBF (r = -0.43, p = 0.038) in all subjects.
Discussion
The present study showed that both HIIT and MVCT training interventions (20 sessions/week
for 5 weeks) enhanced _
VO2peak significantly, and the training modes had no difference on body
composition, even though MVCT resulted in a significant reduction in body weight, BMI and
FM. On the other hand, subjects in HIIT condition had higher PAES scores during training
intervention, and they used half of the exercise time to achieve similar improvement in
_
VO2peak. The findings here suggest that both short-term HIIT and MVCT improve cardiore-
spiratory fitness, however HIIT is more time-efficient and enjoyable for the subjects.

 We observed that the HIIT and MVCT interventions led to a similar improvement in
_
VO2peak by ~10% in obese young women, indicating that the low-volume HIIT protocol (8s
sprinting interspersed with 12s rest) employed in the present study, which is about half the
time and half of the energy expenditure of the continuous exercise practice, is a time-efficient
means for improving cardiorespiratory fitness in overweight and obese young women. As indi-
cated in the research literature, the rapid improvement in _
VO2max or _
VO2peak after 2–8 weeks
of HIIT training may be the result of enhanced central functions such as an increment in stroke
volume [38], and/or the result of peripheral adaptation of skeleton muscles by up-regulating
various mitochondrial enzymes activities such as citrate synthase [32], pyruvate dehydrogenase
[10], 3-hydroxyacyl CoA dehydrogenase [11, 32] and cytochrome oxidase [39]. It is generally
acknowledged that low cardiovascular fitness is a good predictor of heart disease. According to
the dose-response analyses, each 1-MET improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness was associ-
ated with 15% decrement in risk of cardiovascular disease [40]. The magnitudes of the
improvement in _
VO2peak as a result of the prescribed exercises were 0.7 ± 0.3 MET in HIIT and
1.1 ± 0.3 MET in MVCT, which seem to be effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular dis-
eases [23, 41].
Inconsistent with our hypothesis, HIIT did not lead to any beneficial changes in weight loss
and fat loss in this study. This finding, however, is in agreement with some previous studies
that implemented very demanding protocols for 6 weeks [32], and even for 12 weeks of HIIT
intervention [42]. But our finding differs from that reported in Trapp et al’s study [3], which
showed that similar HIIT protocol for a longer duration (15 weeks, as compared to 5 weeks in
our study) led to significant improvement in body composition in a different population
(healthy subjects, as compared to obese young women in the present study). The discrepancy
could be the result of the lengths of the intervention and the characteristics of the subjects.
Although the MVCT intervention led to significant reductions in weight, BMI and FM, when
adjusted with baseline values, no group differences between HIIT and MVCT were found in
changes of body composition. Given the similar energy intakes and the other daily physical
activities between the two groups, the different exercise energy expenditure levels
(26125 ± 2986 KJ in the MVCT group vs. 12919 ± 2159 KJ in the HIIT group) are most likely
to have resulted in the similar outcomes on weight and fat loss.
While total exercise energy expenditure has explained 18–30% of the reductions of body
weight, BMI, FM and PBF, the lack of group differences suggests that the initial FM could be
significantly related to fat loss [3]. Thus, although HIIT intervention with a longer duration
may improve body composition [3, 24], at this time, there is no conclusive evidence that low-
volume mild HIIT would have more favorable effects than high-volume MVCT on weight loss
and body fat loss in overweight and obese populations [42]. Additionally, given the progressive
increase of obesity prevalence [1], and given that the improvement of health-related outcomes
could be independent of weight loss [6, 7], maintaining the body weight and not to have further
weight gain in overweight and obese individuals under HIIT exercise condition could be con-
sidered as beneficial.
As well-established metabolic risk factors [22], blood lipids are associated with cardiovascu-
lar disease [23]. However, we found no positive changes of blood lipids in both HIIT and
MVCT conditions among the obese young women. Almost no studies reported that 2–16
weeks of HIIT resulted in improvement of TC, LDL-C and TG [22, 43, 44], while a positive
finding for HDL-C has been reported [43]. Based on what is known now that a weekly mini-
mum exercise energy expenditure of 1200 to 2200 kcal is the necessary minimum to yield posi-
tive alteration in blood lipids [4], the effect of any exercise on blood lipids may not be
observable until certain exercise thresholds are met [4]. Consequently, with insufficient weekly
Comparison of HIIT and MVCT

11 / 16
 exercise caloric expenditure (1249 ± 143 kcal/wk in MVCT group and 628 ± 105 kcal/wk in
HIIT group) in a short-term intervention, it is not surprising that the present study did not
show any favorable changes in blood lipids in obese females. A recent study, however, contra-
dicted this expectation, as it showed that 20 min HIIT training for 18 sessions in 6 weeks signif-
icantly decreased TC, TG, medium VLDL-C and medium HDL-C in overweight or obese
males [23]. It appears that further investigations are needed to examine the efficacy of different
HIIT protocols on blood lipids, especially taking lipoprotein subclasses into account [23].
However, in designing such studies in the future, it is important to control for the lipid-altering
confounding factors, such as body weight, fat mass, caloric intake, nutrient composition of
diets, and other potentially lipid-altering lifestyle characteristics [4].
After 5 weeks of exercise training, serum testosterone and estradiol decreased in all obese
young women in the present study, suggesting that short-term exercise training could result in
decreased circulating levels of testosterone and estradiol in obese young females. However, the
changes of these steroid hormones were not associated with the improvement of cardiorespira-
tory and weight loss. Previous studies showed that, even for eumenorrheic healthy young
women with normal weight, in response to resistance training [45] or aerobic training [46, 47],
resting testosterone and estradiol levels showed inconsistent changes, including decrease [47],
no change [46] or increase [45]. Inconsistent with the present study, Almenning et al. (2015)
found that high-intensity interval training had no significant effect on serum testosterone,
despite improvement in cardiometabolic profile [48] in women with polycystic ovary syn-
drome (PCOS). Given that sampling in different menstrual phases may have possible influence
on sex hormone concentrations, we also re-examined the data by only including those partici-
pants whose pre- and post-training blood samples were taken at the same phase of the men-
strual cycle, that is, for each subject, both pre- and post-training samples were taken either at
her follicular phase, or at her luteal phase. We removed the subjects whose pre- and post-train-
ing samples were not taken at the same phase (e.g., one at the follicular phase and the other at
the late luteal phase) of the menstrual cycle. This re-analysis excluded 6 subjects in HIIT
group, and 7 in MVCT group. After the removal of these subjects from the analysis, similar
reductions were still observed in circulating testosterone (p = 0.090, η2 = 0.24) and estradiol
(p = 0.089, η2 = 0.24). Nevertheless, we could not rule out the possibility that the changes in ste-
roid hormones might be due to some factors un-related to our exercise training, because this
study did not have a control group of no-exercise. Interestingly, the differences in the reduction
of resting testosterone and estradiol levels in obese young women between HIIT and MVCT
interventions were small, suggesting that exercise intensity may not have significant effect on
serum testosterone and estradiol in overweight and obese individuals.
Affective response to exercise is one important feature of the exercise experience [49].
Besides motivation and competence, feelings of pleasure and enjoyment can predict the adher-
ence to exercise [50]. People tend to avoid participating in exercise if they find it too strenuous,
particularly those from sedentary populations [8]. Therefore, it was suspected that HIIT would
not be considered enjoyable by the sedentary overweight and obese subjects in this study,
although Bartlett et al [25] showed that young, lean and fit men had higher PAES scores after a
HIIT running protocol than after a continuous running protocol. In the present study, the
PAES scores of enjoyment of exercise were taken immediately after every training session, and
this was different from the study by Bartlett et al. [25] in which PAES scores were taken during
cool-down period after the high-intensity intermittent exercise. Moreover, the PAES scores
used in the analyses in this study were the average PAES scores across four training sessions
each week. We observed that PAES scores in HIIT were significantly higher than those mea-
sured in MVCT condition during the intervention, contrary to the findings reported in some
previous studies [49], and to the finding of lower adherence in HIIT reported before [51]. The

 seemingly conflicting results could be the result of different HIIT protocols concerning exercise
intensity and duration in different studies, and differences in factors such as timing of the
work-recovery cycles, type, intensity and number of repetitions, etc. [42, 52]. In the present
study, we selected a relatively mild HIIT protocol for inactive obese young women, and the
subjects in this HIIT protocol showed similar mean HR, and even lower RPE, as those in the
continuous exercise protocol. Furthermore, when the PAES scores in the first two training ses-
sions were compared, the continuous training group still had significantly lower scores than
those of the HIIT group (65 ± 10 in HIIT group and 45 ± 17 in MVCT group, p = 0.001). This
finding, as partially supported by the previous studies [25], indicates that HIIT is also more
enjoyable than moderate-intensity continuous training in overweight and obese individuals.
Collectively, such information suggests that the present HIIT protocol was readily acceptable
by sedentary obese young women, and thus could be a more enjoyable and time-efficient HIIT
training prescription in improving health outcomes for such a population.
The current study has several limitations. First, the pre- and post-measures for some sub-
jects were taken in the follicular phase, while others in late luteal phase, instead of all of them
in the same phase of the menstrual cycle. Given the fact that the intervention was for 5 weeks
only, it would have been unlikely to choose the same phase of the menstrual cycle among sub-
jects of such a population. More importantly, the high rate of abnormal menstrual cycle in
overweight and obese women (54% in the present study) suggested that the subjects might
have PCOS, the most common endocrinopathy in young overweight/obese women [48].
Because we had no diagnosis of this disease, we were not able to assess the potential effect of
this condition. Second, as a common tool to assess body weight and the relevant parameters of
body composition, bioelectrical impedance analysis was used in the present study. However it
is not the “gold standard” in body composition measurement. Considering the efficacy of aero-
bic high-intensity exercise in reducing visceral fat, and the effectiveness of HIIT for reducing
trunk fat [3], more accurate techniques, for instance, Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DEXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT), could be used in
future studies. These more sophisticated techniques can provide more detailed information
about body composition, such as estimation for adipose tissue and muscles, and the informa-
tion about the distribution pattern of adipose tissue on different body parts (trunk, visceral,
subcutaneous, and intermuscular depots). Third, given that various HIIT protocols may have
different effects on weight loss in females, issues such as acute responses to high-intensity inter-
mittent exercise and potential effect of HIIT on sex hormones need to be examined in future
studies for such a population (i.e., overweight and obese women). Finally, this study does not
provide information on a host of other potentially relevant factors (e.g., nutrition status, exer-
cise modality, daily activity, fitness level, weight change, menstrual cycle, etc.) that may affect
this population (i.e., overweight and obese women) on the parameters studied in the present
study. Future studies may consider tighter control of these factors such that the effects of these
different factors could be isolated and identified in a relatively longer intervention.
In conclusion, the present study shows that when compared to MVCT, the HIIT exercise
protocol implemented in this study is a more enjoyable and time-efficient approach in improv-
ing cardiorespiratory fitness and ameliorating sexual hormones in obese young women. The
mild HIIT protocol might be useful for maintaining stable body weight in the sedentary
population.
