Multiple sclerosis prevalence in the United
States commercially insured population
ABSTRACT
Objective: To estimate the US commercially insured multiple sclerosis (MS) annual prevalence
from 2008 to 2012.
Methods: The study was a retrospective analysis using PharMetrics Plus, a nationwide claims
database for over 42 million covered US representative lives. Annual point prevalence required
insurance eligibility during an entire year. Our primary annual MS identification algorithm required
2 inpatient claims coded ICD-9 340 or 3 outpatient claims coded ICD-9 340 or 1 MS-indicated
disease-modifying therapy claim. Age-adjusted annual prevalence estimates were extrapolated
to the US population using US Census data.
Results: The 2012 MS prevalence was 149.2 per 100,000 individuals (95% confidence interval
147.6–150.9). Prevalence was consistent over 2008–2012. Female participants were 3.13
times more likely to have MS. The highest prevalence was in participants aged 45–49 years
(303.5 per 100,000 individuals [295.6–311.5]). The East Census region recorded the highest
prevalence (192.1 [188.2–196.0]); the West Census region recorded the lowest prevalence
(110.7 [105.5–116.0]). The US annual 2012 MS extrapolated population was 403,630
(387,445–419,833).
Conclusions: MS prevalence rates from a representative commercially insured database were
higher than or consistent with prior US estimates. For further accuracy improvement of US prev-
alence estimates, results should be confirmed after validation of MS identification algorithms,
and should be expanded to other US populations, including the government-insured and the
uninsured. Neurology® 2016;86:1014–1021

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease affecting
approximately 400,000 people in the United States and 2.1 million people worldwide.1 MS
affects quality of life, employment, social relationships, and patients’ productivity.2–4 The total
all-cause health care costs associated with MS including direct and indirect costs in the United
States ranged from $8,528 to $52,244 per patient per year.5
Previous MS prevalence studies primarily used 2 different approaches.6–11 One approach was
survey methods6–9; the other approach was electronic medical records.10,11 There are tradeoffs
and limitations to each approach. Three studies6,7,9 used survey data from 1996 or earlier,
whereas electronic medical record studies assembled data from regional cohorts. Most survey
data are dated, while most electronic medical record studies used regional cohorts that limit their
US generalizability.
Due to aforementioned limitations, there is a knowledge gap related to the US prevalence of
MS. Research that includes largely representative samples with flexible algorithms to identify
MS cases is a high priority for various MS stakeholders. This study aimed to estimate the

 MS prevalence in the United States using a
large-scale
national
administrative
dataset
from 2008 to 2012 with multiple algorithms
supported by The National MS Society Prev-
alence Workgroup to identify MS cases.
METHODS Data sources. This study was a retrospective
analysis using the PharMetrics Plus Health Plan Claims Dataset,
a nationwide database of a commercially insured population. The
database consists of individual-level health care utilization and
expenditure data for enrollees in approximately 120 health
plans and over 42 million covered patient lives in 2011 with
demographics that mirror the US Census population. The
database includes both inpatient and outpatient diagnoses and
procedures and both retail and mail-order prescription fill
records. The breadth of the PharMetrics Plus dataset has been
used for national as well as regional benchmarking of health
care utilization and cost. Briefly, the database contained a
number of variables included in claims data (such as encrypted
patient identification number, claim number, ICD-9 clinical
modification, provider code, current procedure terminology
code, national drug code, place of services, and claim date) and
enrollment data (such as encrypted patient identification
number, sex, year of birth, month of enrollment, patient US
Census region, patient state of residence, enrollment eligibility
status, and first and last claim date).
Algorithms to identify MS cases. In this study, we used algo-
rithms to identify patients with MS based on authors’ personal
communication with the National MS Society Prevalence Work-
group.12 The National MS Society Prevalence Workgroup is con-
ducting validation of MS algorithms for claims database analyses
for future MS identification applications. Patients were defined as
MS cases during each calendar year (2008 through 2012) if they
had at least 2 inpatient claims with ICD-9 code 340, at least 3
ICD-9 code 340 outpatient claims, or at least one MS-indicated
disease-modifying therapy (DMT) claim within a calendar year
period. The DMTs included teriflunomide, interferon-b-1b,
interferon-b-1a, glatiramer acetate, fingolimod, mitoxantrone,
and natalizumab. For natalizumab only, patients were defined
as MS cases if they had at least one claim of natalizumab plus
at least one claim of ICD-9 code 340 in any health care setting.
The specific definition for natalizumab was made because
natalizumab is indicated in other diseases such as inflammatory
bowel disease. The abovementioned definition is the primary
algorithm (algorithm I) and is supported by the National MS
Society Prevalence Workgroup.12 The 12-month continuous
eligibility criterion during each calendar year was required for
patients with MS who were eligible to be cases (numerator).
The 12-month continuous eligibility criterion was also required
to determine the total population each year (denominator).
We used 2 alternative definitions as secondary algorithms to
identify MS cases, which were also supported by the National MS
Society Prevalence Workgroup. We defined algorithm II as at
least 2 ICD-9 code 340 inpatient claims or at least 3 ICD-9 code
340 outpatient claims within a calendar year, while algorithm III
included patients with at least 3 of any of the following within a
calendar year: ICD-9 340 inpatient claim, ICD-9 340 outpatient
claim, or MS-indicated DMT claim. The specific definition for
natalizumab was also applied for algorithm III.
Analyses. To estimate the annual MS prevalence, we examined
the longitudinal records for all patients who were continuously
eligible for any annual observational time period. We determined
the MS prevalence for 5 annual point estimates (2008–2012) by
applying all 3 algorithms. The annual period prevalence was esti-
mated and stratified by age, sex, and US Census region. We also
calculated 95% confidence intervals by assuming a normal distri-
bution of a proportion. The annual prevalence was reported by
the number of MS cases per 100,000 individuals in the popula-
tion. Age-adjusted 2012 annual prevalence estimates were
extrapolated to the US population using US Census data.13
This US extrapolation assumed that those who meet all entry
criteria for the numerator (MS cases with continuous eligibility
for the 2012 calendar year) or denominator (all continuously
eligible
individuals
within
the
2012
calendar
year)
are
representative of the entire US population. This extrapolation
should be interpreted with caution. All data manipulation was
performed by SAS 9.2 (SAS institute, Cary, NC); all data
analysis was performed using STATA 12.1 (StataCorp, College
Station, TX).
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. This study protocol was approved by the Colorado Mul-
tiple Institute Review Board (COMIRB) as exempt (COMIRB
Protocol 13-0015).
RESULTS During the entire 5-year observational
period (2008–2012), a total of 9,611,353 unique
individuals were included with at least 1 calendar
year of continuous eligibility. The 1 year of
continuous
eligibility
requirement
resulted
in
20.4% of all unique individuals in the database
(i.e., denominator) with at least 3 months of
eligibility sometime during the 5-year period. Of
those, 2,651,482 individuals (27.6%) were ,20
years of age; 4,675,808 were male (48.7%). Most
of the individuals were from the Midwest region
(37.7%). The primary algorithm, requiring 1 year
of continuous eligibility, resulted in 26.5% (n 5
37,249) of all unique MS cases in the database (i.e.,
numerator)
with
at
least
3
months
eligibility
sometime during the 5-year period.
Annual prevalence. Primary algorithm. A total MS prev-
alence in the US insured population in 2008–2012
ranged from 145.7 to 150.2 per 100,000 individuals.
Specifically, the overall MS prevalence in 2012 was
149.2 per 100,000 individuals (95% confidence
interval [CI] 147.6–150.9). The overall female: male
ratio was 3.13 (95% CI 3.10–3.16). Among female
cases, the prevalence was 224.2 per 100,000 individ-
uals (95% CI 221.4–227.1), while the prevalence
among male cases was 71.6 per 100,000 individuals
(95% CI 70.0–73.2) (table). The pattern of preva-
lence between female and male patients was similar
over the 5-year observational period (2008–2012)
(figure 1).
The peak prevalence was observed in patients aged
45–49 years in both female and male participants.
The peak prevalence for female patients was 455.6
per 100,000 individuals (95% CI 442.1–469.1)
and for male patients was 139.7 per 100,000 individ-
uals (95% CI 127.0–142.8) (table). The patterns of

 prevalence among age range were similar over the
5-year observational period (2008–2012) (figure 2).
According to the US Census region, the highest
MS prevalence was observed in the East Census
region. In 2012, the prevalence in the East region
was
192.1
per
100,000
individuals
(95%
CI
188.2–196.0). The 2012 prevalence in the Midwest,
South, and West regions were 165.0 (95% CI 162.0–
167.9), 111.7 (95% CI 109.2–114.1), and 110.7
(95% CI 105.5–116.0) per 100,000 individuals,
respectively (figure 3). From 2008 to 2012, the prev-
alence slightly increased in the East, Midwest, and
South regions, while it slightly decreased in the West
region (figure 4).
Secondary algorithms. Applying algorithm II in
2012, the overall MS prevalence was 120.9 per
100,000 individuals (95% CI 119.4–122.4). The
prevalence among female participants was 182.4 per
100,000 individuals (95% CI 179.8–184.9); that
among male participants was 57.1 per 100,000 indi-
viduals (95% CI 55.6–58.5) (figure 1).
The observed MS prevalence assuming algorithm
III was similar to the primary algorithm. The 2012
prevalence was 149.2 per 100,000 individuals (95%
CI 147.5–150.8). The prevalence among female
participants was 224.2 per 100,000 individuals
(95% CI 221.4–227.0); that among male partici-
pants was 71.5 per 100,000 individuals (95% CI
69.9–73.2) (figure 1).
Estimated annual US MS population. The estimated age-
adjusted US MS population in 2012 was 403,630
patients (95% CI 387,445–419,833). The most
prevalent 5-year MS age band was 45–49 years, which
included an estimated 65,825 US individuals (95% CI
64,105–67,546). The MS prevalence of adults aged 20–
60 years was 360,489 (95% CI 348,846–372,132).
Based on algorithm II, the estimated age-adjusted
US MS population was 328,052 patients (95% CI
313,274–342,847). Applying algorithm III, the esti-
mated age-adjusted US MS population was similar to
the estimated MS population assuming the primary
algorithm. The estimated MS population estimated
by algorithm III was 403,609 patients (95% CI
387,409–419,828).
DISCUSSION This study used a nationally represen-
tative commercially insured electronic claims database
to determine MS prevalence in the United States. We
found that total MS prevalence was about 150 per

ipants was observed as approximately threefold more
than among male participants. The peak prevalence
was observed in patients 45–49 years of age in both
female and male patients. The East Census region of

 MS prevalence, which slightly decreased over the
observational period.
Our total MS prevalence (149.2 per 100,000 indi-
viduals) was relatively similar to a previous 2010
global MS report,15 which indicated that MS preva-
lence in the United States was 135 cases per 100,000
individuals. Moreover, our estimated MS population
(403,630 patients) was similar to other cited preva-
lence estimates12,16–18 that reported the estimated
number of the MS population in the United States
was about 400,000 patients. However, our estimates
were different from some previous reports.6–11 Most
of the reports6,7,9–11 were local or regional cohorts or
specific subpopulations, with crude prevalence esti-
mates of 177 per 100,000 in Olmsted County, Min-
nesota, in 2000,10 and lower estimates in 2000 with
47.2 per 100,000 population in Texas, 86.3 per
100,000 population in Missouri, and 109.5 per
100,000 population in Ohio.11 The present national
and Midwest regional findings, although slightly
lower than the 2,000 findings from Minnesota,10
include more Southern regions and subregions, and
therefore may remain in line with the most recent US
regional estimates. Only one known study reported a
nationally representative MS prevalence estimate.8
The study was conducted using the Medical Expen-
diture Panel Survey. The study reported that the MS
prevalence in the United States was approximately
0.21% or about 570,000 patients, which was higher
than our observed estimates. The difference was likely
due to different algorithms used in the studies. In the
previous study,8 patients were defined as MS cases if
they had at least one ICD-9 340 diagnosis. The algo-
rithm might overestimate the MS prevalence because
some patients might have an ICD-9 340 claim only
one time for ruling out MS but were not diagnosed
with MS. Thus, the present study’s estimates have a
higher specificity than an algorithm requiring only
one ICD-9 340 claim, but may remain an underesti-
mate of the true MS prevalence.
Our extrapolated estimate of the MS population
(403,630 patients) is likely underestimated due to on-
ly including commercially insured individuals. Most

 enrollees change their health insurance from commer-
cial to Medicare when they become eligible for Medi-
care (generally at 65 years of age). If those with MS
leave their commercial plans for Medicare at a higher
than average rate compared to their peers without
MS, then the extrapolated estimate would be lower
than the truth. For example, the estimated MS pop-
ulation decreased from 42,427 patients age 55–59
years to 19,128 patients age 60–64 years (not shown
in the results). Death is one explanation for the attri-
tion of patients with MS above age 60 years. Another
possibility of lower MS identification in those above
60 years of age includes misdiagnosis including stroke
and other diseases in the elderly that contain over-
lapping signs and symptoms with MS. Further, late-
onset MS is more difficult to diagnose than MS that
develops in persons of younger age.19–21
Female participants were about 3.1-fold more
likely to develop MS than male participants overall.
The finding was similar to previous reports from
the United States and Canada that female participants
were more likely than male participants to develop
MS (2.2–4.1 fold higher).9–11,22,23 Our findings con-
firmed that female participants represent the majority
of the MS population, with 3 or more times higher
prevalence than male participants.12
The peak prevalence was observed in patients 45–
49 years of age. This was similar to previous studies in
Canada22 and the United States,9,10 but different from
a study in the United Kingdom23 and another US
study.11 The difference was likely due to the setting
and population in the studies. The United Kingdom
has a high prevalence of MS. The MS prevalence in
the United Kingdom is about 285.8 per 100,000 in
the female population and 113.1 per 100,000 in the
male population.23 The pattern of prevalence by age
in the United Kingdom is possibly different from that
in the United States. Another US study11 was con-
ducted in 3 US communities. The regional patterns
of MS prevalence could be different from national
estimates.
Our findings indicated that in 2012, the East Cen-
sus region of the United States had the highest MS
prevalence, while the West region of the United
States had the lowest MS prevalence. However, when
looking into a trend of MS prevalence across the
entire observational period (2008–2012), the South
Census region had relatively consistently low MS
prevalence across the observational period. Our Cen-
sus region findings are consistent with a previous US
study24 that indicated that states located in lower
latitudes had lower MS prevalence than states with
higher latitudes. The West region saw a drop in con-
tinuously enrolled individuals within the dataset in
2011 and 2012, the 2 years where the MS
prevalence also decreased. Perhaps those with MS
(numerator) who were continuously enrolled in the
West region were captured within the dataset at a
slightly lower rate than those without MS (denomin-
ator). Factors such as changes in insurance plans or
the distribution of individuals within a region were
not directly observable within this claims analysis.
Although the West region MS prevalence decreased
from 2008 to 2012, all other regions and the overall
US estimates remained constant or slightly increased.
Given the paucity of environmental data present in
claims data, it is difficult to postulate further on the
impact of US region on MS prevalence.
We found that algorithm I and algorithm III pro-
vided similar MS prevalence, while algorithm II pro-
vided
lower
MS
prevalence.
Algorithm
I
and
algorithm III included components of inpatient, out-
patient, and medication claims, while algorithm II
did not include medication claims. Including medica-
tion claims in an algorithm may provide more accu-
rate prevalence than algorithms that do not include
medication utilization. DMTs used in this study to
identify MS cases in algorithms I and III are specific
to MS, except for natalizumab. Therefore, patients
receiving DMTs except for natalizumab are very
likely to be diagnosed with MS. Given that the algo-
rithms tested required multiple medical claims with
an MS diagnosis, it is likely that an algorithm that
does not include DMTs will be unnecessarily too
strict (i.e., individuals with MS with only 1 or 2 out-
patient claims in a calendar year would not be found
by algorithm II). Thus, using algorithm II with only
ICD-9 340 medical claims without DMT pharmacy
claims likely underestimates MS prevalence. On the
other hand, using an algorithm that is less strict in
terms of the number of medical ICD-9 340 claims,
say only requiring one within the year, may lead to
an overestimate of MS prevalence as sometimes a
diagnosis code will be claimed when conducting
rule-out exercises.
Limitations to the present study should be ad-
dressed. First, because of the lack of algorithm valida-
tion defining MS cases within our database, the
algorithms used in this study were based on personal
communication with the National MS Society Preva-
lence Workgroup. Second, the population studied in-
cludes commercially insured individuals. The MS
prevalence might be different within the uninsured
and government-insured (Medicare/Medicaid) popu-
lations. Therefore, caution is advised in the interpre-
tation of the national extrapolation findings. The MS
prevalence in the uninsured population may become
less of an issue for the future because the Affordable
Care
Act
reduced
the
percentage
of
the
US
population without insurance. However, the MS
prevalence in government-insured populations re-
mains unknown. Third, some previous studies9,11

 revealed that race/ethnicity might be a factor affecting
MS prevalence. There are no race/ethnicity data avail-
able within PharMetrics Plus. Finally, because of the
utilization of claims databases, there might be some
misclassification, especially in medical claims. The
algorithms may sufficiently reduce the likelihood for
misclassifying MS cases for those who do not have
MS, but may underestimate the true MS prevalence
by missing some who have MS but were not identi-
fied by the algorithms. We used ICD-9 340 medical
diagnoses or a DMT claim to identify MS cases (for
algorithm I and III). There may be other ICD-9
codes that could improve the accuracy of an MS
claims algorithm. The National Multiple Sclerosis
Society Prevalence Workgroup supported our algo-
rithms and are working toward the validation of
MS algorithms that may include additional ICD-9
or ICD-10 codes.
We found that the overall MS prevalence was about
150 per 100,000 individuals. Female participants had a
threefold higher prevalence than male participants,
with the peak prevalence at age 45–49 years. The East
Census region, the region with predominately north-
ern latitude states, had the highest MS prevalence,
while the South and West regions had the lowest.
The prevalence was relatively consistent over 2008–
2012. For further accuracy improvement of US prev-
alence estimates, results should be confirmed after val-
idation of MS identification algorithms and should be
expanded to other US populations, including the
government-insured and the uninsured.
