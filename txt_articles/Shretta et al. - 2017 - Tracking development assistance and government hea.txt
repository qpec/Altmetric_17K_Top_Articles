Abstract 
Background: Donor financing for malaria has declined since 2010 and this trend is projected to continue for the 
foreseeable future. These reductions have a significant impact on lower burden countries actively pursuing elimina-
tion, which are usually a lesser priority for donors. While domestic spending on malaria has been growing, it varies 
substantially in speed and magnitude across countries. A clear understanding of spending patterns and trends in 
donor and domestic financing is needed to uncover critical investment gaps and opportunities.
Methods: Building on the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation’s annual Financing Global Health research, 
data were collected from organizations that channel development assistance for health to the 35 countries actively 
pursuing malaria elimination. Where possible, development assistance for health (DAH) was categorized by spend on 
malaria intervention. A diverse set of data points were used to estimate government health expenditure on malaria, 
including World Malaria Reports and government reports when available. Projections were done using regression 
analyses taking recipient country averages and earmarked funding into account.
Results: Since 2010, DAH for malaria has been declining for the 35 countries actively pursuing malaria elimination (from 
$176 million in 2010 to $62 million in 2013). The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is the largest exter-
nal financier for malaria providing 96% of the total external funding for malaria in 2013, with vector control interventions 
being the highest cost driver in all regions. Government expenditure on malaria, while increasing, has not kept pace with 
diminishing DAH or rising national GDP rates, leading to a potential gap in service delivery needed to attain elimination.
Conclusion: Despite past gains, total financing available for malaria in elimination settings is declining. Health 
financing trends suggest that substantive policy interventions will be needed to ensure that malaria elimination is 
adequately financed and that available financing is effectively targeted to interventions that provide the best value for 
money.

Background
The launch of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership (RBM) 
in 1998 and the Millennium Development Goals in 
2000 catalysed unprecedented political and financial 
commitment for malaria from donors, such as the Global 
Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (Global 
Fund), the US President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI), 
the World Bank, and others as well as endemic coun-
tries themselves. As a result, global malaria incidence 
and deaths have dramatically declined by 41 and 62%, 
respectively, between 2000 and 2015 [3]. Between 2000 
and 2015, 17 countries eliminated malaria, six of which 
have been certified as malaria-free by the World Health 
Open Access

Organization (WHO) [1]. Thirty-five countries are cur-
rently actively pursuing malaria elimination, with elimi-
nation goals ranging from 2016 to 2035 [2]. According to 
WHO, 21 countries are in a position to achieve at least 
one year of zero indigenous cases of malaria by 2020 [3].
Despite this unprecedented progress, donor funding 
for malaria has declined since 2010 and is projected to 
continue to decline [4, 5]. These reductions in external 
financing are even greater for the sub-set of malaria elim-
inating countries despite demonstrated evidence on the 
returns on investment from elimination [6]. By nature, 
these countries have lower disease burdens and are often 
lower-middle or middle-income countries and therefore 
a lesser priority for donors [5].
The Global Fund, which has been the largest external 
financier supporting eliminating nations, has histori-
cally dispersed about 7% of its total portfolio to eligible 
malaria-eliminating countries. However, under the New 
Funding Model adopted in 2012, resources for this sub-
set of countries declined to less than 5% [5] and have 
declined further under a revised allocation-based model 
adopted by the Global Fund Board in November 2016 
[7]. Other bilateral and multilateral donors are similarly 
diverting resources to higher-burden countries with the 
least ability to pay as measured by their Gross National 
Income (GNI) [8, 9]. In some cases, donors are entirely 
moving away from disease-based funding to general sys-
tem strengthening to address concerns of global health 
security [10]. While integrated systems might help coun-
tries in the final push to malaria elimination and prevent 
reintroduction of malaria, a well-funded malaria pro-
gramme, maintaining a level of vertical oversight, is cru-
cial in the short to medium term [10]. At the same time, 
as the disease becomes less “visible”
, government funds 
for malaria are often diverted to other health priorities 
that are perceived to be greater health threats, risking a 
reversal of the recent gains made in malaria elimination 
[11].
Reductions in financing for countries eliminating 
malaria comes at a critical time—WHO’s Global Tech-
nical Strategy (GTS) for Malaria 2016–2030 and the 
Roll Back Malaria Partnership’s Action and Investment 
to Defeat Malaria 2016–2030 (AIM) together with the 
recently endorsed Sustainable Development Goals, set 
their sights on rapid progress with malaria elimination 
towards attainment of malaria free status in 35 countries 
by 2030. Total funding for malaria control and elimina-
tion was estimated at $2.9 billion in 2015 [1], represent-
ing just 46% of the GTS 2020 milestone of $ 6.4 billion. 
Achieving the global goals will require sustained finan-
cial and political commitment at the global and domestic 
levels [2]. The investments have the potential to deliver 
strong health benefits through fewer deaths and less 
illness valued at over $49 billion, exceeding investment 
costs by a factor of 40 between 2015 and 2030 [12].
There is little published information about the interna-
tional resources funding malaria elimination efforts, how 
these funds are spent and their association with domes-
tic financing. Several published studies describe dis-
bursements of development assistance for health (DAH) 
and government health expenditure (GHE). The Insti-
tute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) [13] has 
been tracking DAH from 1990 onwards, disaggregating 
spending by the source of funding, intermediary chan-
nel, recipient country, and health focus area. Some stud-
ies have concentrated on specific health focus areas, such 
as HIV and the estimates produced by Countdown to 
2015 [14], which focused on maternal, child and newborn 
health. WHO annually publishes a World Malaria Report 
[3], which includes government expenditure informa-
tion obtained from countries’ national malaria control 
programmes. However, expenditure data are often una-
vailable and replaced by budget information. Pigott et al. 
[15] collated co-financing data from the Global Fund 
grant proposals to obtain government budgets on malaria 
interventions. The system of national health accounts, 
available in a limited number of countries, provide valu-
able information about financing flows, but are limited 
by issues of comparability, timeliness and level of report-
ing. Past analyses have either focused on single countries 
and/or disease programmes or across multiple countries 
aimed at measuring the effectiveness of DAH by explor-
ing how DAH is allocated across recipient countries and/
or health focus areas or interventions.
To better understand past and future trends in financing 
for malaria elimination, this paper systematically tracks 
malaria-specific estimates of DAH expenditures from all 
major international development agencies from 1990 to 
2013 with projections up to 2017, and splits this spend-
ing into 13 malaria activities or intervention areas that 
describe how the resources were used. In addition, GHE 
as a source for malaria financing was tracked from 2000 
to 2014 to explore associations between DAH and GHE to 
inform future decision-making and better align need with 
actual resource allocation. A clear perspective on where 
resources have been and will be available will uncover 
critical investment gaps and investment opportunities.
Specifically, the paper aims to: (a) track development 
assistance for the prevention and treatment of malaria 
from channel to recipient country or region, for 1990–
2013; (b) generate lower-bound estimates of how devel-
opment assistance for the prevention and treatment of 
malaria was used by activity or intervention area for the 
same time period; (c) estimate GHE for malaria from 
2000 to 2014; and, (d) estimate DAH projected financing 
from 2014 to 2017 in the 35 eliminating countries.

Methods
This analysis was conducted in 35 malaria-eliminat-
ing countries defined in 2015 as countries that have a 
national or sub-national evidence-based elimination goal 
and/or are actively pursuing elimination (zero malaria 
transmission) within its borders [16] (see Fig. 1).
DAH
DAH is defined as the financial and in-kind contributions 
for maintaining or improving health in low- and middle-
income countries. This analysis focuses on financial con-
tributions, as there is no reliable database that captures 
in-kind contributions. Disbursement of development 
assistance for malaria was estimated to the 35 countries 
for 1990 through 2013. Building on the IHME’s annual 
Financing Global Health research, data were collected 
from primary agencies and organizations that channel 
DAH or third party organizations or private organiza-
tions that collect such data [13]. Detailed methodology 
is described elsewhere [17], however, in brief, resources 
were tracked from the channel back to the source (origi-
nal donor) where possible, and further forward to the 
country or region recipient. This permits disaggregation 
of data into categories such as private or specific public 
sources, bilateral and multilateral agencies, and recipi-
ent countries. When underlying disbursement data were 
not available, disbursements were estimated using econo-
metric time-series methodologies and appropriations or 
commitment data. Double counting generated by trans-
fers among channels was removed manually in order to 
estimate a total envelope without exaggerating the true 
amount of resources provided. Throughout this analysis, 
figures are standardized to US$ 2014 to allow for uniform 
comparisons.
DAH by service delivery area
DAH for malaria elimination was split into categories 
identifying the type of investment. The Organization for 
Economic Cooperation’s (OECD) Creditor Reporting 
System (CRS) database contains information on DAH 
that has been channeled through bilateral agencies [18]. 
From the CRS data, the amount of DAH disbursed per 
project, the recipient country, the project title, and the 
project description was collated. A keyword search was 
run to further disaggregate malaria DAH into interven-
tion or activity categories. For Global Fund malaria 
grants, budget data were extracted by service delivery 
areas from programme grant agreements. The fraction 
of aid allocated to every service delivery area for each 
year in a grant was calculated, and the budgeted malaria 
aid fractions to actual DAH for each year of a grant were 
applied. When budget information was missing from a 
Fig. 1 List of malaria-eliminating countries included in this analysis
 Page 4 of 11
Shretta et al. Malar J  (2017) 16:251 
programme grant agreement, DAH was distributed to 
the service categories based on service delivery areas that 
were listed in the Global Fund online grants portfolio 
for the specific grant. Some funders, such as the World 
Bank, did not have this kind of information and there-
fore, funding by service delivery areas was unable to be 
disaggregated.
GHE
A diverse set of data points and reports were used to 
estimate the share of domestic government health budg-
ets spent on malaria from 2000 through 2014. The WHO 
annually publishes a World Malaria Report (WMR), which 
includes government expenditure (or budget information 
when expenditures are unavailable) obtained from coun-
tries’ national malaria control programmes. GHE as source 
data were extracted from these reports from 2008 to 2015 
and from Pigott et al. [15], which collated co-financing 
data from the Global Fund grant proposals to obtain gov-
ernment budgets on malaria treatment. Each data source 
has its own concerns. Government expenditure published 
in the WMR does not generally provide comprehensive 
tracking of spending on healthcare workers and capital 
costs. In addition, reports from different years are incon-
sistent, mostly due to weak or non-existing expenditure 
tracking systems, impeding any temporal comparisons. 
Pigott et al. reports government expenditure that includes 
spending on human resources, but these numbers are 
from government budgets rather than actual expenditure. 
If budgets and spending differ in a non-random manner 
these estimates will be biased. To estimate government 
expenditure that is comprehensive of all public spending 
on malaria, a linear regression on data from both sources 
was performed. Country-specific regression analyses took 
into account country, the year the data were published, 
whether the data were comprehensive of human resources 
and capital costs, whether the data were expenditure or 
budget, and time. These were modelled using basis splines 
to avoid assuming linear growth.
Estimates of DAH projected financing from 2014 to 2017
To estimate projected DAH spending, a regression that 
took into account DAH averages to recipient countries 
and budgeted or earmarked funding was used. The data-
set used to train the model was tailored to reflect the data 
available for each forecast. These individual training sets 
were made in order to take into account future malaria 
projects for which financial commitment data was not 
available at the time of writing this paper.
Uncertainty estimates
Uncertainty intervals for government health expenditure 
and DAH projected financing from 2014 to 2017 were 
calculated by sampling the variance–covariance matrix 
generated by each linear regression 1000 times.
GHE as a function of GDP and disease burden
To assess the association between GHE and a country’s 
income as measured by the Gross Domestic Product 
(GDP) per capita, GHE for malaria as a percentage of 
total health expenditure was plotted against GDP and 
further analysed by malaria disease burden as measured 
by Annual Parasite Index (API).
Results
Funding landscape for malaria elimination
Between 2000 and 2010, the overall funding for malaria 
for the 35 malaria-eliminating countries grew 2.5-fold 
from $179 million in 2000 to over $458 million. Despite 
a reduction in overall funding after 2010, total fund-
ing to these countries amounted to over $335 million in 
2013 of which 81% was from domestic resources and 19% 
from donors. South Africa was later excluded in subse-
quent analysis as it had significant GHE for malaria until 
2009, thereby skewing the results of the underlying trend 
in GHE by the remaining 34 countries. Without South 
Africa, total financing amounted to $430 million in 2010 
(see Fig. 2).
DAH
DAH increased 33-fold between 2000 and 2010 for the 35 
malaria-eliminating countries from just over $5 million 
in 2000, accelerating after 2007, and peaking at over $176 
million in 2010. However, DAH sharply declined by over 
65% between 2010 and 2013 to about $60 million. The 
largest declines in DAH were seen in China which was 
90% externally financed in 2010 compared to only 10% in 
2013 and in Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and 
the Solomon Islands with declines of over 25%. Nonethe-
less, external funding was 11.5-fold higher in 2013 than 
in 2000. In 2013, DAH accounted for less than 10% in 
Azerbaijan and Belize. Overall financing trends are pro-
jected to continue to decrease between 2014 and 2017 
with a low of $28 million in 2017 (uncertainty interval 
$9.6 million to $66.4 million). Figure 3 illustrates malaria 
expenditure by donors (by the primary sources or inter-
mediary channels) from 1990 and projected to 2017, and 
government from 2000 (when data was available from) 
for the 34 malaria-eliminating countries (excluding South 
Africa).
The Global Fund was the largest source of external 
funding for malaria-eliminating countries providing 
96% of the total DAH in the 35 countries in 2013. How-
ever after peak funding in 2011, Global Fund resources 
for these countries decreased by approximately 58% 
from over $140 million in 2011 to approximately $60

million in 2013. Other donors that provided funding to 
malaria-eliminating countries over the period 2007–
2011 included the World Bank, the Australian govern-
ment (particularly for the Pacific islands), and the Bill 
& Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). Malaria-specific 
funding from the World Bank halted in 2012 with the 
conclusion of the World Bank Booster Programme 
for Malaria. Similarly bilateral funding from Australia 
decreased sharply in 2011 by 64% decreasing further 
with the integration of Australia’s aid programme into the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.
DAH by service delivery area
Figure 4 illustrates the trend in spending by service deliv-
ery area in the 35 malaria-eliminating countries. The 
graph indicates that DAH channels prioritise various 
service delivery areas at different times. In general, DAH 
increased along all interventions starting in 2003 and 
peaking in 2010 at over $176 million. Treatment, diagno-
sis and vector control [indoor residual spraying (IRS) and 
bed nets], and to a lesser extent, health system strength-
ening and surveillance grew at faster rates than other 
service delivery areas, consistent with recommendations 
for malaria elimination. Exceptions included the Domini-
can Republic where surveillance accounted for 40% of 
expenditures in 2009 declining to less than 10% in 2013. 
Expenditures for malaria treatment increased between 
2003 and 2007 but have declined since 2010. At the same 
time, DAH expenditures on diagnosis increased gradu-
ally, consistent with WHO recommendations on testing 
before treatment, peaking in 2010, but decreasing there-
after. In most countries, the ratio of DAH expenditure on 
diagnosis versus treatment increased after 2008, reaching 
a 50:50 split in Bhutan and Costa Rica by 2013. A notable

exception is Thailand with 25% of total expenditure on 
treatment but very little on diagnosis. There was a high 
growth in vector control spend particularly on bed nets 
as well as other undefined vector control interventions 
peaking in 2010 and declining thereafter. By 2012, expen-
ditures on bed nets were less than other vector control 
interventions. However, bed nets still accounted for 80% 
of expenditure in Bhutan. Other vector control inter-
ventions accounted for over 80% of total expenditure in 
Nepal, and up to 50% in Sao Tome and Nicaragua. There 
was some growth in community outreach and strength-
ening of surveillance systems, however, this growth was 
not uniform; with surveillance expenditure actually 
decreasing overall between 2010 and 2012. A large pro-
portion of funds could not be allocated over any of the 
service delivery areas particularly between 2008 and 2011 
(14%).
GHE for malaria
For the 35 malaria-eliminating countries in aggregate 
(excluding South Africa as an outlier), GHE as source 
for malaria elimination steadily increased since 2000 
from about $131 million per year to about $250 million 
in 2014, outpacing DAH. In 2010, at the peak of external 
finding, government spending was 1.4 times higher than 
the donor resources available.
Table 1 shows the growth rates across various time 
periods for both GHE and DAH for the 35 malaria-elimi-
nating countries.
GHE as a function of GDP and API
Figure 5 illustrates government health expenditure for 
malaria as a function of GDP and API. There is a wide 
variation in the GHE on malaria uncorrelated with 
GDP indicating that GDP is not directly associated with 
increased domestic spending in malaria. Higher GDP 
countries with low government expenditure on malaria 
include several countries in Latin America (Costa Rica, 
Panama, Belize) as well as Swaziland and Thailand. Most 
of the countries spent less than 0.05% on malaria with 
the exception of Vanuatu (0.1%). Furthermore, the Figure 
illustrates that malaria expenditure is also not directly 
associated with disease risk as measured by API.
Discussion
This is the first study that tracks DAH and GHE specifi-
cally for malaria eliminating countries from 1990 to 2014 
with projections to 2017. This study also makes use of 
enhanced methods providing a more comprehensive 
tracking of DAH and GHE than has previously been uti-
lized in other studies. The findings clearly demonstrate 
a growing uncertainty about the future availability of 
Fig. 4 Donor assistance for health (DAH) by service delivery area for 35 countries

DAH for malaria elimination. At the same time, while 
government health expenditures have steadily increased, 
they have not kept pace with the declining DAH. Many 
malaria-eliminating countries could risk facing signifi-
cant funding gaps, which can increase the risk of malaria 
resurgence highlighting the need for an interim solution 
until the economies of these countries have sufficiently 
grown to fill the gap.
The findings demonstrate three periods for DAH for 
malaria: a period of moderate growth in the 1990s, accel-
erated growth in the first decade of the 2000s of 97%, 
and a decline of 65% since 2010. In the 35 countries 
included in this review, total financing for malaria grew 
from $179.5 million to $301.7 million between 2000 and 
2013 of which DAH accounted for 19% in 2013. DAH 
began to decline in 2011, coinciding with the Global

Fund’s decision to halt its 11th grant cycle. During this 
period, DAH declined by 65% in the 35 malaria-eliminat-
ing countries overall and is projected to further decline 
through 2017.
The new allocation methodology adopted by the Global 
Fund in 2012, uses a combination of disease burden and 
GNI per capita to determine the financing that coun-
tries will receive for the three diseases. Under this New 
Funding Model, country-specific funding to the sub-set 
of countries attempting to eliminate malaria has declined 
by over 30% [5]. Further declines in allocations have 
been noted under a revised model adopted in November 
2016. These changing polices have major implications 
for the financing and delivery of health services, par-
ticularly for malaria elimination. Eliminating countries 
typically have lower disease burdens and are often mid-
dle-income countries and therefore tend to be less attrac-
tive investments for donors looking for easy to measure 
high impact results. Of the 35 countries included in this 
review, 2 are high-income countries, 15 are upper mid-
dle income, 14 are lower middle income, and 3 are lower 
income (no data was available on Mayotte). Eighteen 
of these countries are ineligible to receive Global Fund 
financing. Three countries have graduated from Global 
Fund malaria financing in the past 6 years: China (2011), 
Dominican Republic (2013) and Iran (2012) and one 
country transitioned out of Global Fund support in 2016 
(Paraguay). Sri Lanka, which attained malaria-free cer-
tification by WHO in September 2016 and Botswana, 
will receive one more transitional grant from the Global 
Fund. The Philippines submitted their final proposal 
for funding in the first quarter of 2017 together with a 
transition plan for sustainable financing. Several other 
countries are approaching one or more donor eligibility 
thresholds in the next few years. Although the majority of 
funding in these countries comes from domestic sources, 
DAH still plays an important role in the delivery of health 
interventions, particularly to vulnerable populations that 
are often underserved by the government health system. 
Donors such as the Global Fund will need to continue to 
prioritize these populations to deliver on its 2017–2022 
Global Fund Strategy, which aims to achieve progress 
toward a world free of the burden of HIV/AIDS, tubercu-
losis, and malaria.
The Global Fund continued to provide the largest 
source of DAH to malaria-endemic countries account-
ing for over 90% of all external financing. It is not pos-
sible to unpack donor contributions specifically to 
malaria disbursed by the Global Fund, however, in gen-
eral, the US government provides 35% of all funding, 
the United Kingdom, 16%, France, 9% and non-official 
sources including foundations and charities, 6%. A more 
diverse set of donors including the World Bank and vari-
ous bilateral donors played a larger role in the malaria 
agenda prior to the establishment of the Global Fund. For 
example, Australia played a major role in funding malaria 
control in the Pacific Islands; however, this funding has 
been drastically reduced since with the creation of the 
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade replacing Aus-
tralian Aid whose new Health for Development Strategy

2015–2020 [9] focuses on health as development with lit-
tle on disease-specific funding.
Across the 35 countries included in this review, GHE 
almost doubled between 2000 and 2010, ultimately 
resulting in about $249 million in 2014 (excluding South 
Africa as an outlier). In most countries, the upward GHE 
trend between 2008 and 2014 has been maintained or 
increased. Nine countries included in the review (Alge-
ria, El Salvador, Guatemala, Malaysia, Mexico, Panama, 
Paraguay, ROK, Saudi Arabia) are entirely domestically 
financed.
DAH was disaggregated into 13 service delivery areas 
allowing for cross-country and regional comparisons. 
The observed trends in spending or allocation by service 
delivery area are not uniform or consistent with epide-
miological profiles or regional policies demonstrating the 
need for greater emphasis on allocative efficiency. Vec-
tor control, mostly bed nets continues to be the largest 
cost driver across all regions, followed predominately by 
treatment costs.
Thirty-one of 35 countries spent less than 10% of their 
malaria DAH funding on surveillance, a key malaria 
elimination intervention between 2010 and 2013. The 
ratio of DAH expenditure on diagnosis versus treatment 
increased after 2008 reaching a 50% split in most coun-
tries by 2013 bringing countries closer to compliance 
with WHO’s Test: Treat: Track policy. Notable excep-
tions are Honduras, Tajikistan, and Thailand with mini-
mal expenditure on diagnosis. As actual cases decrease, 
expenditure on diagnosis is expected to be at least twice 
the spending on treatment. However, discrepancies 
between use of DAH for certain service delivery areas 
and strategy for malaria elimination could be explained 
by governments using DAH to fund allowable expenses 
and GHE to pay for the rest, for example procurement 
of diagnostics. Nevertheless, the analysis does raise the 
question on whether DAH is being spent on the most 
effective strategies for malaria elimination.
Morel and colleagues noted, “it is important to ask 
whether current interventions are used appropriately and 
what is the most cost-effective way to scale up activities 
to the levels needed” [19]. With declining DAH, available 
resource will need to be used more efficiently. This would 
include focusing the needs of the malaria programme 
on the most effective interventions coupled with better 
targeting of intervention delivery to strategic popula-
tions to maximize value-for-money and prevent drug and 
insecticide resistance and from available resources [20]. 
At the same time, there is a need to move donor fund-
ing for malaria control away from an input model that 
mostly focuses on the procurement and distribution of 
key inputs (most notably mosquito nets) towards more 
support for operational improvements, capacity building 
in programme management, improved disease and 
intervention surveillance as well as knowledge genera-
tion and sharing to strengthen the impact of elimination 
interventions.
The WHO Global Technical Strategy for Malaria esti-
mated that USD 6.8 billion will be needed annually to 
reduce malaria related morbidity and mortality by 90% 
between 2015 and 2030 and projected gaps of more than 
half of this financing need. Although gains in health sys-
tem efficiency can be used to make reduce the discrep-
ancy between available finances and need, current trends 
suggest that many countries may face gaps in financing 
for malaria elimination. If increasing domestic health 
financing is the solution, countries will need to increase 
their own spending on malaria beyond historical trends. 
The expectation of the economic and health financing 
transition suggests that as countries develop they spend 
more on health than they did before. Of 35 currently low-
income and middle-income countries, included in this 
review, 22 countries currently meet the Chatham House 
goal of spending 5% of GDP or $86 per capita on health 
[21].
There are several complementary ways for countries 
to fill the gap between needs and resources until govern-
ment allocations catch up with the financing transition. 
The Addis Ababa Action Agenda calls on a number of 
resource mobilization efforts encompassing aid, domes-
tic public resources, and support from the private sec-
tor. Many national governments are considering raising 
health budgets by improving the capacity to raise tax 
revenue including the implementation of Pigovian or sin 
taxes. In the Philippines, the Sin Tax Reform Bill, passed 
in 2012, increased taxes on tobacco and alcohol, generat-
ing USD 2.3 billion within 2 years increasing the Depart-
ment of Health budget by 63% in 2015. This revenue has 
freed up resources, which would have otherwise been 
used for social protection of the poor and has trickled 
down for use for malaria and other diseases targeted for 
elimination.
Two other areas of resource mobilization which have 
had limited traction are better harnessing of private 
financing as well as innovative approaches, such as social 
impact bonds, airline and financial transactions taxes. 
Blended approaches which refer to the use of funds to 
leverage or de-risk private investment in development are 
increasingly being explored. Although there are no cur-
rent estimates on their scale, these financing instruments 
have been used with success in other sectors within and 
outside of health and have the potential to catalyse future 
additional private sector support.
The Roll Back Malaria Action for Investment in 
Malaria (AIM) suggests that investment in malaria could 
deliver strong health benefits through fewer deaths and 
 Page 10 of 11

less illness that can be valued at over $49 billion. These 
benefits exceed investment costs by a factor of 40 over 
the period to 2030 [12]. Focused advocacy at all levels is 
needed to reach key decision-makers in order to highlight 
the social and economic benefits of investing in malaria 
elimination and the risks of not doing so. In particular, 
emphasis on the threat of drug resistance in undermin-
ing success and posing a risk of regional health security 
is needed. Continued engagement is needed with govern-
ments to focus attention on increased domestic budgets.
This analysis has several limitations. Many of the DAH 
expenditures could not be allocated to specific interven-
tions, therefore introducing a potential bias. In addition, 
the spending by governments could not be further disag-
gregated by intervention area and it is possible that DAH 
was spent on particular interventions due to co-financing 
of others through domestic sources. Estimates of domes-
tic expenditures on malaria were obtained from sources 
which relied on self-reporting by countries with little tri-
angulation of data and the findings should therefore be 
interpreted as such.
Nevertheless, the findings provide strong evidence 
on the uncertainty about the future availability of DAH 
in malaria elimination settings and the wide variation 
in support for malaria programmes by governments 
[12]. Many malaria-eliminating countries could risk fac-
ing funding gaps, which could be compounded if coun-
tries face funding cliffs with multiple donors phasing 
out simultaneously. These disruptions in service delivery 
could also confer negative cross-border externalities to 
neighbouring countries, compromising regional elimina-
tion targets and ultimately global eradication.
Conclusion
Financing for malaria elimination is declining at a time 
when commitment to elimination will be crucial to paving 
the way to global malaria eradication. While government 
health expenditure has steadily increased in most countries, 
this increase has not been proportional to the rate of waning 
external financing, particularly in middle-income countries, 
increasing the risk of deadly and costly malaria resurgences. 
Notwithstanding, existing financing has not been used in 
the most cost-effective or efficient manner. Mechanisms to 
increase efficiency and value for money are urgently needed 
as well as further analysis on the extent to which expendi-
tures are in line with the interventions recommended by the 
WHO. Innovative health financing mechanisms may pro-
vide a respite—until domestic financing is able to fill the gap 
created by diminishing donor resources.
