Abstract 
Objectives: The adverse effects of cigarette smoking have been widely studied before, whilst the effects of hookah 
smoking has received less attention, although it is a common habit in the Middle East. Here we have investigated the 
effects of cigarette and hookah smoking on biochemical characteristics in a representative population sample derived 
from the Mashhad stroke and heart atherosclerotic disorder (MASHAD) cohort study, from Northeastern Iran.
Study design: A total of 9840 subjects from the MASHAD population study were allocated to five groups; non‑
smokers (6742), ex‑smokers (976), cigarette smokers (864), hookah smokers (1067), concomitant cigarette and hookah 
smokers (41).
Methods: Baseline characteristics were recorded in a questionnaire. Biochemical characteristics were measured by 
routine methods. Data were analyzed using SPSS software and p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: After adjustment for age and sex; the presence of CVD, obesity, metabolic syndrome, DM and dyslipidemia 
were significantly (p < 0.001) related to smoking status. After multivariate analysis, HDL (p < 0.001), WBC (p < 0.001), 
MCV (p < 0.05), PLT (p < 0.01) and RDW (p < 0.001), and the presence of CVD (p < 0.01), obesity (p < 0.001), metabolic 
syndrome (p < 0.05) and DM (p < 0.01) remained significant between cigarette smokers and non‑smokers. Between 
hookah smokers and non‑smokers; uric acid (p < 0.001), PLT (p < 0.05) and RDW (p < 0.05), and the presence of obesity 
(p < 0.01), metabolic syndrome (p < 0.001), diabetes (p < 0.01) and dyslipidemia (p < 0.01) remained significant after 
logistic regression.
Conclusion: There was a positive association between hookah smoking and metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity 
and dyslipidemia which was not established in cigarette smoking.

Background
Tobacco smoking is one of the leading causes of mortality 
and morbidity globally. Tobacco smoking is responsible 
for 6 billion deaths per year globally, and nearly 10% of 
deaths due to tobacco smoking are in passive smokers 
[1]. On average, a smokers life span is reduced by 10 years 
compared to non-smokers [2]. There are different ways of 
smoking substances including bidis (the hand-rolled cig-
arette), cigar, cigarettes, roll-your-own, hookah, kretek, 
pipe smoking and vaporizers [1].
The hookah is the second most common way of 
smoking tobacco. The hookah, which is also called the

“waterpipe” or “shisha” is an apparatus invented in 16th 
century in an attempt to purify tobacco smoke by passing 
it through water [3]. Hookah use has become prevalent 
particularly, in developing countries. The misconception 
that inhaling smoke through the hookah is less toxic, 
and its relative cheap price may be responsible for this 
increase [4]. However, a recent study has indicated that 
hookah smoking is equivalent to smoking of a cigarette 
[5].
Although the effects of cigarette smoking on health has 
been well studied, the effects of hookah smoking on dis-
ease development, and biochemical measurements is less 
studied. Findings on the adverse effects of hookah smok-
ing on lipid profile are inconsistent [6, 7]. Only an experi-
mental study and a single study with a relatively small 
sample size have been conducted about hookah smoking 
and hematological measurements [8, 9]. The only study 
on the effect of hookah smoking and serum glucose level 
in a small sample population was recently published [10].
We aimed to determine the association between ciga-
rette and hookah smoking and metabolic parameters, 
obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, meta-
bolic syndrome and dyslipidemia in the MASHAD study 
population [11].
Methods
Data was taken from MASHAD (Mashhad stroke and 
heart atherosclerotic disorder) study (2010–2012). Indi-
viduals were recruited from the population living in 
Mashhad using a stratified cluster random sampling 
technique [11]. A total of 9840 participants aged between 
35 and 65 entered the study. Baseline characteristics were 
recorded in a questionnaire including demographic data, 
history of smoking (cigarette, hookah), cardiovascular 
risk factors and anxiety and depression tests. Fasting 
blood samples were taken after 14 h of fasting from ante-
cubital vein. Cell blood count (CBC) including hemo-
globin (Hb), red blood cell (RBC), mean corpuscular 
volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), 
mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), 
hematocrit (HCT), red blood cell distribution width 
(RDW) and platelet count (PLT) were measured with 
Sysmex K21.
Levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), serum triglyc-
eride (TG), total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein 
(HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and uric acid, 
serum urea, creatinine (Cr) and hs-CRP were measured 
by auto-analyzer using Pars Azmoon kits (mg/dl). Glo-
merular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated using the 
Cockcroft and Gault formula.
Definitions
CVD was considered to be present if there was a positive 
personal history of cardiovascular disease.
Diabetes mellitus was defined as a FBG ≥ 126 mg/dl, 
or being treated with an oral hypoglycemic agents or 
insulin.
Hypertension was diagnosed in individuals with sys-
tolic blood pressure at or above 140 mmHg and/or a dias-
tolic blood pressure at or above 90 mmHg, or in persons 
who were on anti-hypertension medication.
The presence of metabolic syndrome was determined 
using the IDF criteria [12].
Dyslipidemia 
was 
defined 
as 
TC ≥ 200 
mg/dl 
(5.18 mmol/l), LDL-C ≥ 130 mg/dl (3.36 mmol/l), or 
TG ≥ 150 mg/dl (1.69 mmol/l), or HDL-C < 40 mg/dl 
(1.03 mmol/l) in men and < 50 mg/dl (1.30 mmol/l) in 
women [13].
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 
20 on 2015. ANCOVA, independent sample t test, Chi 
square and multiple logistic regression tests were carried 
on for analysis. p < 0.05 was considered significant.
Results
Out of 9840 participants 6742 were non-smoker, 976 
were ex-smoker, 864 were cigarette smoker, 1067 were 
hookah smoker and 41 were both cigarette and hookah 
smoker. Data were analyzed after adjustment for age and 
gender. The association between biochemical measure-
ments and smoking status are shown in Table 1. FBG 
(p = 0.013), cholesterol (p = 0.045), HDL (p < 0.001), GFR 
(p < 0.001), uric acid (p < 0.001) and hs-CRP (p < 0.001) 
were significantly different while LDL (p = 0.9), triglyc-
erides (p = 0.125), BUN (p = 0.63) and Cr (p = 0.65) 
were the same between the 5 groups defined by smoking 
status.
Table 2 shows the association between hematological 
parameters and smoking status. After adjustment for age 
and sex, WBC (p < 0.001), RBC (p < 0.001), Hb (p < 0.001), 
HCT (p < 0.001), MCV (p < 0.001), MCH (p < 0.001), PLT 
(p = 0.004) and RDW (p < 0.001) were significantly differ-
ent but MCHC (p = 0.065) was not different with respect 
to smoking status.
After adjustment for age and sex, smoking status 
was significantly associated with the presence of CVD 
(p < 0.001), obesity (p < 0.001), metabolic syndrome 
(p < 0.001), diabetes (p < 0.001), and dyslipidemia. Table 3 
shows these relationships.
Results of multivariate analysis are shown in Table 4. 
Only PLT and RDW remained significant in the cigarette 
or hookah smokers in comparison with non-smokers. 
While HDL, MCV and WBC and remained significant

only in the cigarette smokers in comparison with the 
non-smokers. Glucose and WBC were significantly dif-
ferent between ex-smokers and non-smokers. Moreover, 
CVD was significant higher for ex-smokers and current 
cigarette smokers in comparison with non-smokers. 
The presence of obesity and metabolic syndrome was 
positively associated with hookah smoking and nega-
tively associated with cigarette smoking. Dyslipidemia 
was associated with hookah smoking only in this sample 
(Table 4).
Discussion
The current study investigated the effect of hookah and 
cigarette smoking on the presence of CVD, obesity, MetS, 
diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia and some biochemical 
and hematological parameters. To the best of our knowl-
edge this is the largest study exploring the adverse effect 
of hookah smoking. In line with a recent study in Saudi 
Arabia FBG was not significantly associated with hookah 
smoking [10] while cigarette smokers had significantly 
lower levels of glucose in compare with non-smokers.

The few studies on the effect of hookah smoking on lipid 
profile are inconsistent. Our results show significantly 
lower levels of cholesterol and HDL in hookah smokers in 
comparison to non-smokers, while TG and LDL was not 
different between these two groups. A similar study with 
152 subjects including 75 cigarette smoker, 77 hookah 
smoker and 16 healthy controls did not show any signifi-
cant relationship between hookah smoking and levels of 
plasma lipids [6]. While, Koubaa et al. [14] with 68 sub-
jects reported lower levels of HDL in hookah smokers in 
comparison with non-smokers. They also showed a sig-
nificant increase in serum TG in hookah smokers, which 
we did not find. We did not find any differences in GFR 
and uric acid in hookah smokers in comparison with 
non-smokers while cigarette smoking significantly asso-
ciated with impaired GFR. Furthermore, serum Cr and 
urea were not significantly different in hookah nor ciga-
rette smokers compared to non-smokers.
Hookah smokers had significantly lower levels of RBC, 
HCT and higher levels of WBC and PLT in comparison 
with non-smokers. In other words, we found that the 
effect of hookah and cigarettes on RBC and HCT was 
in the opposite direction. Moreover, HB and RBC levels 
were similar in combined cigarette and hookah smok-
ers as in non-smokers. This is not consistent with some 
previous studies. Miri-Moghaddam et al. [9] found that 
chronic exposure of rats to water pipe smoke was associ-
ated with a significantly increase in RBC and HCT whilst 
not affecting Hb, WBC and PLT. In a case–control study 
from Sudan, hookah smokers had significantly higher 
levels of Hb, HCT, RBC and WBC while there was no 
association between hookah smoking and PLT [8].
Surprisingly, we found the effects of hookah smok-
ing were greater with respect to some CVD risk factors 
compared with cigarette smoking. The association of 
hookah smoking on the prevalence of obesity, metabolic 
syndrome and diabetes mellitus were in the opposite 
direction from cigarette smoking. Obesity, metabolic 
syndrome, diabetes and dyslipidemia were positively 
associated with hookah smoking while negatively associ-
ated with cigarette smoking. Interestingly the prevalence 
of obesity, metabolic syndrome and diabetes subjects 
who smoked both cigarette and hookah was less than 
hookah smokers and more than cigarette smokers. More-
over, the prevalence of dyslipidemia which was positively 
associated with hookah and cigarette smoking individu-
ally, was higher in subjects who smoked both hookah and 
cigarettes. Our findings are in line with the results of the 
population based study of 2032 individuals. In this study 
it was found that hookah smoking was positively related 
to metabolic syndrome and almost all components of 
metabolic syndrome [15]. Another study on the adverse 
effects of hookah, indicated the positive relation between 
hookah and diabetes [16].
Conclusion
In contrast with the public belief that hookah elimi-
nates the toxicity of tobacco in compare with cigarette 
we found that the adverse effects of hookah smoking 
could be even greater than cigarette. Prevalence of obe-
sity, metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia and diabetes was 
significantly higher in hookah smokers in compare with 
non-smokers and even cigarette smokers.
