Prospective mate characteristics such as kindness, intelligence, easygoingness, and
physical attraction are ranked consistently highly by both men and women. However,
rank measurement does not allow for determinations of what level of a mate
characteristic is rated most desirable. Based on a more informative percentile scale
measurement approach, it was reported recently that mean desirability ratings of IQ in a
prospective partner peaked at the 90th percentile, with a statistically significant reduction
from the 90th to the 99th percentiles. The purpose of this investigation was to replicate
the recently reported non-linear desirability effect associated with IQ, in addition to the
evaluation of three other valued mate characteristics: easygoing, kindness, and physical
attraction. Based on a sample of 214 young adults, it was found that all four mate
characteristics peaked at the 90th percentile. However, the IQ and easygoing mean
desirability ratings evidenced statistically significant mean reductions across the 90th to
the 99th percentiles, whereas kindness and physical attraction did not. Finally, the
objectively and subjectively assessed intelligence of the participants was not found to be
associated with the participants’ desirability ratings of IQ. We interpreted the results to
be consistent with a broadly conceptualized threshold hypothesis, which states that the
perceived benefits of valued mate characteristics may not extend beyond a certain point.
However, mate characteristics such as intelligence and easygoing become somewhat less
attractive at very elevated levels, at least based on preference ratings, for reasons that may
be biological and/or psycho-social in nature.
Recently, Gignac, Darbyshire, and Ooi (2018) noted that much of the research in the area
of attraction/desirability and prospective mate characteristics relied upon rank-based
and/or conventional Likert-based measurement approaches (e.g., Partner Preference
Scale, Buss & Barnes, 1986). Although much has been learned from such research, Gignac
et al. (2018) contended that such measurement approaches preclude the clear evaluation
of what level of any particular characteristic, including intelligence, is the most attractive.
In addition, on the basis of their review of previous research in the area, Gignac et al.
(2018) noted that there was a non-negligible amount of variance associated with the
desirability of IQ in a prospective partner: Thus, not everyone was attracted to intelligence
as a mate characteristic to the same degree. However, little research had been conducted
to identify predictors of such variability.

 As a consequence, to overcome the previously employed ranked-based and conven-
tional Likert-based approaches to measurement, Gignac et al. (2018) administered a
newly developed percentile-based questionnaire to a sample of 383 young adults
(ages = 17–35 years; mixture of university students and general community partici-
pants). The newly developed questionnaire was administered in two forms: sexual
attraction specifically and partner preference. The two forms of the questionnaire were
administered to help distinguish between IQ as a sexually attractive characteristic
specifically, suggesting more clearly fundamental biological benefits, and partner interest
more generally (marriage, children, etc.), suggesting more ambiguously a combination of
biological and psycho-social benefits.
With respect to the sexual attraction version of the questionnaire, the participants
were asked to rate on a 6-point scale the degree to which they would find sexually
attractive a person who, at first sight, interested them, and who they later learned had a
level of intelligence that was greater than 1%, 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90%, and 99% of the
population. Furthermore, the participants were asked to imagine that they were single, if
they were not. By comparison, the partner interest version of the questionnaire was nearly
identical to the sexual attraction specifically version of the questionnaire, except that the
participants were asked to rate the degree to which they would be interested in the person
as a potential romantic partner (e.g., marriage and children) on a similar 6-point scale, if
they later learned that the person’s intelligence level was greater than 1%, 10%, 25%, 50%,
75%, 90%, and 99% of the population.
Gignac et al. (2018) found that the patterns of means associated with the sexual
interest specifically and partner interest versions of the questionnaires were distinctly
non-linear across the seven percentiles of IQ. Specifically, there was a relatively moderate
increase in the desirability rating means between the 1st and 25th IQ percentiles, followed
by a relatively large increase in the desirability rating means between the 25th and 75th IQ
percentiles. Finally, Gignac et al. (2018) reported a relatively small increase in desirability
rating means from the 75th to the 90th IQ percentiles, followed by a small, but statistically
significant, decrease in desirability rating means from the 90th percentile to the 99th
percentile. Thus, the results were consistent with a statistically significant cubic function:
two bends in the pattern of means. Gignac et al. (2018) interpreted the results to suggest
that a relatively high level of intelligence (IQ � 120), rather than a very high level of
intelligence (IQ � 135), was considered, on average, the most desirable level of
intelligence from the perspective of both sexual attraction specifically and partner
interest more generally.
Gignac et al. (2018) also administered a battery of four intelligence tests to the
participants to test the hypothesis that individual differences in objective intelligence
correlate with individual differences in the ratings of desirability of intelligence in a
prospective mate. Theoretically, a positive correlation was expected, on the basis of the
attraction–similarity hypothesis (Byrne, 1971; Hoyle, 1993; Morry, 2005). Gignac et al.
(2018) found that general intelligence correlated negatively (r � �.20 to �.25) with the
desirability ratings at the 25th and 50th IQ percentiles. However, no statistically
significant correlations were observed for the IQ higher percentiles (i.e., 90th and 99th IQ
percentiles). As a consequence, Gignac et al. (2018) interpreted the results to suggest that
relatively more intelligent people were relatively unattracted to average and lower IQ
levels. However, there was an absence of evidence to suggest that relatively more
intelligent people were relatively more attracted to higher IQ levels. Thus, the attraction–
similarity hypothesis was, at best, partly supported.

 Linear versus threshold hypotheses
With respect to the desirability of IQ in a prospective mate/partner, one may
distinguish between the linear IQ hypothesis and the IQ threshold hypothesis (Gignac
et al., 2018). The linear IQ hypothesis represents the notion that ratings of
attractiveness/desirability should increase linearly with the prospective mate/part-
ner’s IQ, as the biological benefits associated with mating with a person may be
expected to increase linearly with the IQ of the mate/partner (Miller, 2000). In
particular, large sample genetics-based research suggests that intelligence is associated
progressively with several beneficial biological attributes, including a greater
likelihood to possess genes that predispose a person to better physical health (e.g.,
Hagenaars et al., 2016). On this basis, progressively higher levels of perceived
intelligence in a prospective mate should be regarded as progressively more attractive
from sexual selection perspective (Miller, 2000).
In contrast to the linear hypothesis, the IQ threshold hypothesis represents the notion
that the benefits of intelligence cease after a certain point, implying a non-linear
association between intelligence and socially valuable attributes. For example, Li, Bailey,
Kenrick, and Linsenmeier (2002) suggested that an average level of intelligence in a
prospective partner may be sufficient for most people, as only an average level of
intelligence is required to carry out day-to-day activities, successfully. Gignac et al. (2018)
labelled such a position the IQ 100 threshold hypothesis. In addition, others have
contended that the benefits of intelligence cease at approximately an IQ of 120, with
respect to various socially valuable characteristics such as creativity and academic
achievement (e.g., Getzels & Jackson, 1962). Gignac et al. (2018) labelled such a position
the IQ 120 threshold hypothesis. In addition to the linear hypothesis and the two
threshold IQ hypotheses, Gignac et al. (2018) also described the possibility of a positive
exponential effect, such that the value of intelligence increases non-linearly and positively
at the upper end of the IQ spectrum (e.g., SAT scores and income; Robertson, Smeets,
Lubinski, & Benbow, 2010).
As described above, the results of Gignac et al. (2018) were essentially consistent with
the IQ 120 threshold hypothesis, as the mean ratings of attractiveness did not continue to
increase beyond the 90th percentile. Instead, the mean ratings decreased to a small degree
from the 90th to the 99th IQ percentiles. Why a very high level of intelligence (99th
percentile) was rated, on average, less desirable than a high level of intelligence (90th
percentile) remains to be determined. Gignac et al. (2018) suggested that the effect
should, first, be replicated, as non-linear effects are often unreplicated (McClelland &
Judd, 1993). Furthermore, Gignac et al. (2018) suggested that intelligence may not be
unique with respect to rated attractiveness and the threshold effect. Instead, several
desirable mate characteristics may exhibit a similar non-linear trend in the means,
including a reduction in desirability from the 90th to the 99th percentiles.
For example, with respect to kindness and easygoingness, much of the attractiveness
research to date has assumed that greater and greater levels of these characteristics are
progressively more attractive (e.g., Jensen-Campbell, Graziano, & West, 1995; Urbaniak &
Kilmann, 2003). However, it is possible that very high levels of kindness and/or
easygoingness in a prospective partner may not be viewed as, on average, the most
desirable. Such a hypothesis is supported on the basis that very high levels of kindness
and/or easygoingness may be viewed as an indication of a lack of confidence, ambition,
and/or dominance (Caird, 1991), all of which are detractors to attractiveness (Bryan,
Webster, & Mahaffey, 2011; Feingold, 1992). Thus, as per ‘intelligent’, the consistently
observed high ranking of ‘kindness’ as a mate characteristic (Buss, Shackelford,
Threshold effects
3
 Kirkpatrick, & Larsen, 2001) does not necessarily imply that an exceptionally high level of
kindness would be viewed, on average, as the most desirable in a mate.
In addition, on the one hand, the association between physical attraction and degree of
desirability in a partner may be predicted to be linear, as there is evidence to suggest that
physically attractive faces and bodies are indicators of good health, fertility, and genes
(Rhodes, Chan, Zebrowitz, & Simmons, 2003; Soler et al., 2003). On the contrary,
however, very high levels of physical attractiveness are associated with some socially
regarded negative qualities, including an increased incidence of divorce (Ma-kellams,
Wang, & Cardiel, 2017). In addition, extreme levels of physical appeal in a prospective
partner may incite feelings of insecurity and dissimilarity in others (Buss, 2003), which
may be expected to reduce ratings of desirability at very elevated levels. As a consequence,
it was considered useful to determine whether mate characteristics other than
intelligence were associated with desirability threshold effects and possibly even
desirability rating reductions from the 90th to the 99th percentiles.
Predictors of IQ desirability ratings: Objective and subjective intelligence
Although a substantial amount of research has established intelligence as a relatively
highly ranked/rated characteristic in a mate, there are non-negligible individual
differences in the rated value of intelligence. For example, the results reported by Regan
(1998) suggest that around 2.5% of her sample rated minimally acceptable IQ
expectations in partner as low as the 10th percentile. Finally, based on the Intelligence
Percentile Attraction/Interest Scale employed by Gignac et al. (2018), the standard
deviation associated with the 90th IQ percentile was reported at 1.06 (coefficient of
variation = .23).
Predictors of individual differences in the rated desirability of intelligence in a partner
remain a relatively unexamined question. An obvious possibility is that the level of
intelligence of a person influences the level of intelligence they desire in a prospective
mate/partner. Such a position is aligned with the attraction–similarity hypothesis (Byrne,
1971; Hoyle, 1993; Morry, 2005), which states that people are attracted to each other, at
least in part, to the degree that they are similar. In a corresponding manner, a positive
correlation has been reported between the intelligence scores of spouses measured
objectively with IQ tests (r = .30 to .40; Van Leeuwen, Van Den Berg, & Boomsma, 2008;
Watson et al., 2004). Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the similarity in
partners’ IQ scores occurs at selection, rather than evolves over the course of the
relationship (Mascie-Taylor, 1989). The phenomenon is known as assortative mating for
intelligence (Jensen, 1967). The small correlations reported by Gignac et al. (2018)
between objectively measured IQ and ratings of IQ desirability lend some support to the
assortative mating for IQ phenomenon. However, as reviewed above, the correlations
were not sufficiently consistent to be considered compelling evidence.
Although there is ample theoretical and empirical evidence to support the notion that
actual similarity may influence rated attraction (Clore & Byrne, 1974; Montoya, Horton, &
Kirchner, 2008), it has been suggested that the attraction-similarity association may occur,
at least in part, due to perceived similarity, rather than actual similarity, especially at the
beginning of an acquaintanceship (Berg & Clark, 1986; Condon & Crano, 1988;
Sunnafrank & Ramirez, 2004). Furthermore, there is empirical evidence to support the
notion that perceived similarity plays a broad role in attraction to prospective mates/
partners. For example, Montoya et al. (2008) reported a meta-analytic correlation of .49
between perceived similarity (between newly acquainted strangers) and degree of
4

 attraction (Montoya et al., 2008). However, little research has focussed on the dimension
of perceived similarity of IQ and rated attraction.
In an important way, self-assessed intelligence and objectively assessed intelligence
share only approximately 10% of their variance (Freund & Kasten, 2012; Gignac, Stough,
& Loukomitis, 2004; Zajenkowski, Stolarski, Maciantowicz, Malesza, & Witowska,
2016). Furthermore, self-assessed intelligence may be considered more akin to a
personality dimension, rather than a proxy for task-based IQ scores (Chamorro-
Premuzic & Furnham, 2004). As a consequence, given the distinction between
objectively measured intelligence and subjectively measured intelligence, it may be the
self-reported subjective impressions of a person’s own IQ and the same person’s
impressions of a prospective partner’s IQ that helps determine, in part, the degree to
which that person is attracted to a prospective partner (Byrne, 1971; Montoya et al.,
2008). In summary, given the perceived similarity and attraction hypothesis, the
theoretical and empirical distinction between self-assessed intelligence and task-based
intelligence, and the relatively weak and inconsistent correlations reported by Gignac
et al. (2018) with objectively measured intelligence, self-assessed intelligence may be a
more substantial and consistent predictor of individual differences in desirability IQ
ratings for a prospective partner.
In perhaps the only relevant investigation, to date, Tidwell, Eastwick, and Finkel
(2013) recruited volunteers to engage in a series of opposite sex speed dates. The
volunteers completed an intake questionnaire that consisted of 14 self-rated mate
characteristics, one of which was ‘smart’. The difference in ratings between the
respective daters’ responses to the ‘smart’ item may be considered a measure of
perceived intelligence similarity. Based on a multiple regression analysis, Tidwell et al.
(2013) failed to find a statistically significant unique effect between perceived
intelligence similarity (no previous interaction) and romantic liking of the other person
(b = �.02). Perhaps, a limitation associated with Tidwell et al. (2013) is that perceived
intelligence was measured with a single item. In addition, the regression analysis was
based on scores derived from each person’s subjective ratings of their own intelligence,
which would have involved two sources of measurement invalidity. A more rigorous
approach would exclude one source of possible measurement invalidity, by not relying
upon subjective impressions for both people. As a consequence, it was considered
useful to test the perceived attraction-similarity hypothesis with self-reported intelli-
gence scores from a multi-item inventory and degree of rated attraction to a prospective
partner, based on the prospective partner’s specified IQ (i.e., no second source of
measurement invalidity).
Summary and purpose
Gignac et al. (2018) found that the association between rated attraction and IQ percentile
levels of a prospective partner was distinctly non-linear, with a sharp statistically
significant increase in rated attraction from the 25th to the 75th percentiles and a small,
but statistically significant, reduction in rated attraction from the 90th to the 99th
percentiles. However, it remains to be determined whether other desirable traits (e.g.,
kindness, easygoing, and physically attractive) evidence similar threshold effects.
Furthermore, Gignac et al. (2018) found only modest and inconsistent associations
between objective intelligence and rated attraction to a prospective partner across
various IQ percentiles. Based on the perceived attraction–similarity hypothesis, it was
considered plausible that perceived intelligence (i.e., self-reported intelligence) may be a

 more substantial predictor of rated attraction to IQ in a prospective partner. As a
consequence, the purpose of this investigation was to have participants rate along a
percentile continuum of four typically considered desirable attributes: intelligence,
kindness, easygoing, and physically attractive. In addition, intelligence was measured
objectively and subjectively to compare them as predictors of rated attraction to IQ.
Although Gignac et al. (2018) did not find any gender differences, we also explored the
possibility that gender may evidence main and/or interaction effects.
Method
Sample
The original sample consisted of 220 participants. However, because six of the
participants reported their ages as above 35 years, we omitted them to help ensure
comparability with Gignac et al. (2018). As a consequence, the final sample consisted of
214 first-year psychology students recruited through a large Australian university’s online
research participation system (70.6% female, Mage = 19.32 years, SD = 2.87). Partial
course credit was granted in exchange for participation. All participants spoke English as
their first language. Information on ethnicity was not obtained; however, the University is
populated by a primarily white, European student body. Written consent was provided
prior to participation, in accordance with ethics approval granted by the university’s
research ethics committee.
Measures
Partner Preference Scale
To compare our results with previous studies, the Partner Preference Scale was
administered (Buss & Barnes, 1986). The ranking scale consists of 13 partner character-
istics: kind and understanding, religious, exciting personality, creative and artistic, good
housekeeper, intelligent, good earning capacity, wants children, easy going, good
heredity, college graduate, physically attractive, and healthy.
Percentile Attraction/Interest Scales
Scales designed to assess the degree to which a person finds desirable various
characteristics in a potential mate along a percentage continuum (1%, 10%, 25%, 50%,
75%, 90%, and 99%; see Appendix S1). The scales exist in two forms: One form is relevant
to sexual attraction specifically, and the other form is relevant to a potential romantic
partnership (marriage, children). The sexual attraction specifically form poses the
following question: ‘How sexually attracted to the person would you be, if you later
learned that their [trait] level was such that they were. . .’ The partner interest form poses
the following question: ‘How interested would you be in the person as a potential partner
(e.g., marriage, children), if you later learned that their [trait] level was such that they
were. . .’ For the sexual attraction form, the 6-point response scale was extremely
unattracted = 1; very unattracted = 2; unattracted = 3; attracted = 4; very attracted = 5;
and extremely attracted = 6. Finally, for the partner interest form, the six-point response
scale was extremely uninterested = 1; very uninterested = 2; uninterested = 3; inter-
ested = 4; very interested = 5; and extremely interested = 6. The two forms were
administered

 attractiveness, and easygoing (in that order; not counter-balanced). To reduce the
possibility of the participants making trade-offs across the mate characteristics, all eight of
the percentile attraction items were presented individually, without any possibility of
returning to a previous response. In addition, the participants were not informed about
how many mate characteristics they were going to rate.
Intelligence
Task-based assessed intelligence (TBAI) was measured with four cognitive abilities tests.
Fluid intelligence was measured with the Advanced Progressive Matrices (Raven, 1966).
The APM consists of 36 items; however, due to time constraints, only the odd-numbered
items were administered in this investigation. Working memory capacity was measured
with a slightly adapted version of the Letter-Number Sequence subtest from the WAIS-IV
(Wechsler, 2008). Processing speed was measured with all four forms of the Connections
test (Salthouse et al., 2000). Speed component scores were generated from a principal
components analysis of the four Connections tests (i.e., speed component). Crystallized
intelligence was measured with the Advanced Vocabulary Test (Gignac, Shankaralingam,
Walker, & Kilpatrick, 2016). The AVT consists of 21 multiple-choice items with five
response alternatives (see Appendix S2). In this sample, the descriptive statistics and
internal consistency reliabilities (coefficient alpha) were as follows: APM a = .66
(M = 10.23; SD = 2.87); Letter-Number Sequencing a = .79 (M = 9.54; SD = 2.68);
Connections a = .71 (M = 96.85; SD = 19.15); and AVT a = .59 (M = 10.41; SD = 3.24).
Self-Assessed Intelligence (SAI) was measured with the Self-Report Intelligence
Questionnaire (SRIQ; Gignac et al., 2004). The SRIQ is a 9-item questionnaire (5-point
Likert scale; strongly disagree to strongly agree). Three of the items are keyed negatively.
Each item is roughly representative of one of the subtests within the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scales (e.g., ‘I know a lot of worldly facts’; ‘I am poor at solving logical
problems’). The ninth item is a general indicator (‘I am intelligent’). Internal consistency
reliability was estimated at .72.
Procedure
The testing battery was administered as a part of a multiportion study relevant to
intelligence and test-taking motivation (�50 min). After providing informed consent, and
completing demographic questions, the participants completed the self-report measures
on a computer (online Qualtrics) in a testing laboratory. Next, they completed the
cognitive ability tests in the following order: Advanced Vocabulary Test, Advanced
Progressive Matrices, Letter-Number Sequencing (L-NS), and Connections. The AVT and
APM were administered on a computer (Qualtrics) in a testing laboratory. The L-NS and
Connections tests were administered face-to-face by an experimenter who was in the
testing room continuously.
Results
All analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS Statistics (version 25). No outliers were
identified based on the outlier interquartile range rule with a 3.0 multiplier (Hoaglin &
Iglewicz, 1987). Furthermore, the data were considered sufficiently normally distributed
(skew < 2.0) for the purposes of parametric analyses (Bishara & Hittner, 2012).

 Ranked mate characteristics
As can be seen in Figure 1, kindness (M = 1.80; SD = 1.32) was the most highly ranked
mate characteristic, based on Partner Preference Scale. The exciting personality
(M = 3.43; SD = 2.21) and intelligent (M = 3.88; SD = 1.82) mate characteristics were
the second and third most highly ranked characteristics. Furthermore, based on the
Games–Howell

procedure
(bootstrapped

re-samples), their means were statistically significantly different from each other,
DMrank = �0.45, 95% CI: �0.84/�0.10. Next, easygoing (M = 5.25; SD = 2.62), healthy
(M = 5.40; SD = 2.33), and physically attractive (M = 5.57; SD = 2.70) were the next
highest ranked mate characteristics and were not statistically significantly different from
each other (e.g., easy going vs. physically attractive, DMrank = �0.32, 95% CI: �0.81/
0.26). Finally, the Pearson correlation between the mean mate characteristic ranks
obtained in this investigation and those reported in Buss and Barnes (1986) was estimated
at r = .98, which lends support to the validity of the data.
Percentile rated mate characteristics
As can be seen in Table 1, none of the attraction type main effects (i.e., sexual attraction
specifically vs. partner interest) were significant statistically for any of the four Likert-
percentile rated characteristics. Thus, the analyses failed to uncover main effects due to
attraction type (sexual attraction specifically vs. partner interest), as per Gignac et al. (2018).
By contrast, based on a series of repeated measures contrast analyses (a.k.a., trend
analyses; Lomax & Hahs-Vaughn, 2012), all four mate characteristics were associated with
statistically significant one-way within-subjects cubic effects (see Table 1), which implied
two bends in the pattern of means. The first bend in the IQ mate characteristic means was
consistent with a non-linear increase in rated desirability for IQ from the 1st to the 50th
percentile (see Figure 2, Panel A). By contrast, the second bend was consistent with an
inverted U-shaped effect from the 50th to the 99th percentile. Furthermore, a statistically
significant decrease in mean rated desirability for IQ was observed across the 90th and
Figure 1. Mean ranks ( ) and 95% confidence intervals (whiskers) associated with the 13 mate
characteristics (N = 214).

 99th percentiles for the sexual attraction specifically (Hedge’s g = .19, p < .001) and
partner desirability conditions (Hedge’s g = .12, p = .010). Although a statistically
significant reduction was observed at the group level, it should be acknowledged that the
effect size was small in magnitude and that the majority of the participants rated the 90th
and 99th percentiles as equally sexually attractive specifically and desirable in a partner
(59.8% and 62.1%, respectively). Overall, the results were essentially consistent with the
threshold IQ 120 hypothesis, with a slight reduction in desirability from the 90th to the
99th IQ percentiles (see Table S1 for the means and SDs; see Table S2 for full t-test results).
The easygoing mate characteristic evidenced a pattern of means similar to intelligence
(see Figure 2, Panel B). Furthermore, a statistically significant decrease in mean rated
desirability for the easygoing characteristic was observed across the 90th and 99th
percentiles for the sexual attraction specifically (Hedge’s g = .13, p < .001) and the
partner desirability conditions (Hedge’s g = .15, p < .001; see Tables S1 and S2 for full

 results). Again, as per IQ, although it may be suggested that there was a statistically
significant reduction at the group level, it should be acknowledged that the majority of the
participants rated the 90th and 99th easygoing percentiles as equally attractive across
both sexually attractive specifically and partner conditions (72.9% and 69.6%, respec-
tively).
In contrast to the intelligence and easygoing mate characteristics, the kind and
physically attractive mate characteristics did not evidence a statistically significant
decrease in rated desirability from the 90th to the 99th percentiles (see Figure 2, Panels C
and D; see also Tables S1 and S2). Instead, the most substantial mean level of desirability
was achieved by the 90th percentile and remained essentially the same at the 99th
percentile.
Finally, as can be seen in Figure 2 (Panels B–D), the easygoing, kindness, and physical
attractiveness characteristics exhibited very similar patterns of desirability means across
the percentiles for both attraction types (sexual attraction specifically and partner
interest), which was consistent with the non-significant and/or small interaction partial
eta-squared estimates (see Table 1). By contrast, there was some meaningful degree of
percentile by attraction type interaction associated with the intelligence characteristic
(partial g2 = .162, p < .001). The nature of the interaction was disordinal (see Figure 2,
Panel A). Specifically, higher desirability means were observed for the sexual attraction
specifically condition, in comparison with the partner condition, at lower levels of IQ; an
effect that was reversed at elevated levels of IQ.
Gender effects
Across all four characteristics, the gender main effect was not found to be significant
statistically (see Table 1). Thus, collapsed across all seven percentile conditions and
attraction conditions (specifically sexual and partner interest), no difference in the main
effect male and female rated desirability means was found. However, it would be
misleading to suggest that males and females responded to the ratings in an entirely similar
manner, as there were two-two-way interactions that were significant statistically.
Specifically, as can be seen in Table 1, there was a significant interaction between gender
and percentile for the rated intelligence characteristic (partial g2 = .027, p = .005) and
the rated kindness characteristic (partial g2 = .023, p = .012). As can be seen in Figure 3
(Panels A and C), the magnitude of the increasing shift in desirability for intelligence and
kindness was larger for females than for males, from lower to higher rated IQ/kindness
percentiles. Statistically significant two-way interaction effects were not observed for the
easygoing and physically attractive characteristics. Finally, in the light of the sample size,
three-way interactions were not considered interpretable and were, therefore, not
reported in this investigation.
Latent variable modelling
First, we factor analysed (principal axis factoring; promax rotation) the Percentile
Attraction Scale items to determine whether the seven items (sexual attraction
specifically) for each of the four mate characteristics were associated with one or more
dimensions. Across all four mate characteristics, the four-factor analyses revealed two
sexual attraction factors: low percentiles (1st, 10th, and 25th) and high percentiles (75th,
90th, and 99th). Because the 25th and 90th sexual attraction percentile items loaded .90+
on the respective low IQ and high IQ sexual attraction factors, they were used as the
Threshold effects
11
 dependent variables in the modelling. The 50th percentile item cross-loaded onto the low
IQ and high IQ percentile factors (see Tables S3 and S4). Furthermore, an additional factor
analysis of the four 50th percentile sexual attraction items (intelligent, easygoing, kind,
and physically attractive) yielded a single-factor (see Table S5), which we interpreted as a
general sexual attraction/interest method factor. Stated alternatively, the 50th percentile
item factor captured individual differences in how highly people rated sexual attraction
across all four mate characteristics.
All latent variable modelling was conducted with Amos (version 24). To represent self-
assessed intelligence (SAI) as a latent variable, we created three item parcels out of the
nine SRIQ items (parcel 1: sum of items 1, 2, and 3; parcel 2: sum of items 4, 5, and 6; and
parcel 3: sum of items 7, 8, and 9). In addition, to represent task-based assessed
intelligence (TBAI), a latent variable defined by the four intelligence tests was specified. It

 was hypothesized that SAI and/or TBAI would relate negatively to the 25th percentile
sexual attraction item and positively with the 90th percentile sexual attraction item,
controlling for the effects of the 50th percentile sexual attraction method factor.
The model depicted in Figure 4 was associated with acceptable levels of model close-
fit, v2(59) = 85.26, p = .014, SRMR = .058, RMSEA = .046, CFI = .950, TLI = .934.
Furthermore, SAI and TBAI intercorrelated positively, r = .26, p = .017, 95% CI: 0.09/
0.41, although only 6.8% of the variance was shared, as expected. No other hypothesized
effects were significant statistically, however. Specifically, neither SAI nor TBAI was found
to relate to either low IQ (SAI: b = .00, p = .956, 95% CI = �0.11/0.13; TBAI: b = �.05,
p = .522, 95% CI = �0.20/0.11) or high IQ sexual attraction ratings (SAI: b = .07,
p = .398, 95% CI: �0.09/0.23; TBAI: b = �.01, p = .921, 95% CI: �0.21/0.18). The null/
alternative Bayes factor was estimated at 105.36 for the .00 beta weights reported in
Figure 4.1 Thus, the null model was approximately 100 times more likely than the
alternative model with an effect between SAI and rated desirability of IQ in a prospective

 partner. Very similar results were obtained for the IQ partner interest ratings (see
Figure S2). Although the structural coefficients depicted in Figure 4 are unique effects, it
should be noted that none of the zero-order correlations between the SAI and TBAI latent
variables and the 25th and 90th IQ percentile sexual attraction ratings, or any other IQ
percentile ratings (e.g., partner interest), were significant (see Table S6).
Discussion
Percentile levels
The pattern of means associated with the desirability of IQ levels across the sexual
attraction specifically and prospective partner conditions replicated closely the results
reported by Gignac et al. (2018). In particular, when measured along a percentile
continuum, the 90th percentile was rated, on average, the most desirable (especially for
females). Thus, although ‘intelligent’ has been found to be the second or third most highly
ranked characteristic in a partner (Buss et al., 1990, 2001; Goodwin & Tinker, 2002;
Perilloux, Fleischman, & Buss, 2011), investigations based on ranks have failed to suggest
that a very high level of intelligence (99th percentile; IQ � 135) is, on average, regarded
as somewhat less attractive than a high (90th percentile; IQ � 120) level of intelligence.
Theoretically, the non-linear effects may be regarded as more consistent with the
threshold hypothesis (Getzels & Jackson, 1962; Torrance, 1962), rather than the linear
(biological fitness) hypothesis (Miller, 2000; Prokosch, Yeo, & Miller, 2005). Thus, at
least superficially, the view that intelligence should be regarded as a behavioural
indicator of good genes (linear hypothesis) does not appear to extend to the very high
range of IQ. Correspondingly, we note that a recent investigation found a non-linear
relationship between objective IQ in managers and the perceived leadership capacity of
those managers (by their subordinates/peers), such that, beyond an IQ of 120, perceived
leadership capacity decreased steadily (Antonakis, House, Simonton, & Robert, 2017).
As per Gignac et al. (2018), it remains to be determined why, at the group level, people
view an IQ level at the 99th percentile as less attractive than the 90th percentile. It may be
speculated that the typical person believes that very elevated levels of IQ are associated
with negative characteristics (e.g., social competence difficulties; Neihart, 1999).
Recently, based on an unrepresentative, self-selected sample, Mensa members were
shown to be several times more likely to be diagnosed with a variety of disorders (e.g.,
obsessive–compulsive
disorder,
Asperger’s
syndrome,
asthma;
Karpinski,
Kolb,
Tetreault, & Borowski, 2017). By contrast, studies with more representative samples
have tended to find very intellectually abled people to be well-adjusted and healthy
(Bergold, Wirthwein, Rost, & Steinmayr, 2015; Zeidner & Shani-Zinovich, 2011). If
elevated IQ levels are, in fact, associated with negative biological and/or psycho-social
characteristics, then it is possible that, as a group, the participants in this investigation
were influenced by such considerations. Alternatively, the participants may have
appealed to stereotypes relevant to those with very elevated levels of intelligence
(Baudson & Preckel, 2013; Preckel, Baudson, Krolak-Schwerdt, & Glock, 2015).
The easygoing prospective mate characteristic also evidenced a statistically significant
reduction in mean desirability from the 90th to the 99th percentiles. Although the effect
was not large in effect size terms (d � .15), some people appear to entertain one or more
slightly negative attitudes towards very elevated levels of easygoingness. It remains to be
determined what those attitudes are. Some research suggests that the negative attitudes
may be related to perceptions of a lack of confidence, ambition, and/or dominance (Caird,
14
Gilles E. Gignac and Clare L. Starbuck
 1991). Further research based on asking participants why they provided lower ratings to
the 99th percentile (if they did so) is encouraged.
In contrast to IQ and easygoingness, kindness and physical attraction did not
evidence a reduction in mean rated desirability from the 90th to the 99th percentiles.
However, it must be acknowledged that these two typically valued mate characteristics
were also consistent with a threshold hypothesis (Getzels & Jackson, 1962), rather than
a linear hypothesis. That is, there were no statistically significant increases in mean
desirability across the 90th and 99th percentiles. Instead, a high level (90th percentile)
of kindness and physical attraction was rated essentially as desirable as the 99th
percentile. Until recently, the IQ threshold hypothesis had been discussed almost
exclusively in the context of predicting creativity and academic achievement (Getzels &
Jackson, 1962; Muller et al., 2005; Torrance, 1962). Interestingly, the balance of the
empirical evidence suggests that the IQ 120 (90th percentile) threshold hypothesis is
not supported in those areas (Kuncel & Hezlett, 2010; Wai, Lubinski, & Benbow, 2005).
By contrast, in the context of rated sexual appeal, rated partner desirability, and rated
leadership capacity, the 90th percentile threshold hypothesis appears to be supported.
Other researchers have speculated upon rated desirability threshold effects between
attraction and intelligence (Lee, Dubbs, Von Hippel, Brooks, & Zietsch, 2014; Li et al.,
2002). Thus, continued consideration for non-linear threshold effects is encouraged in
future research to help understand more insightfully the precise nature and meaning of
elevated desirability ratings commonly observed in the mate selection literature.
Attraction type
Two types of attraction were evaluated in this investigation: sexual attraction specifically
and partner interest more generally. Closely consistent with Gignac et al. (2018), a
statistically significant interaction was observed across the 25th to 90th IQ percentiles
across the sexual attraction specifically and partner interest conditions. In simple terms,
the statistically significant interaction depicted in Figure 2 (panel A) suggests that
progressively higher levels of IQ were rated progressively (albeit slightly) more favourably
for a partner in a high-investment relationship context, in comparison with evaluations
restricted to sexual attraction. Thus, these results are consistent with the previous
investigations that have found males and females to require progressively higher levels of
intelligence (and other valued characteristics) across increasingly greater relationship
investments (from one date to marriage; Kenrick, Groth, Trost, & Sadalla, 1993; Regan,
1998).
In absolute terms, however, it should be acknowledged that the differences across the
two attraction type conditions were remarkably small for the IQ percentile ratings and
virtually non-existent for the other three mate characteristics (as depicted in Figure 2). A
similar pattern of results was reported in Gignac et al. (2018). On the one hand, it may be
suggested that the participants viewed all four mate characteristics at the 90th percentile
as sexually attractive, as all of the sexually attracted specifically condition means were 4.3
and above (between ‘attracted’ and ‘very attracted’). However, it also possible that the
typical person was not necessarily thinking purely in sexual terms, despite the clear
specification to do so. In practice, we may need to consider that responders to survey-type
items ‘are not literalists’ (McCrae & Costa, 2003, p. 45). Further research to determine
whether participants truly view intelligence, or any other characteristic, as sexually
attractive (i.e., sexually arousing) may need to be conducted. Of some relevance, Gignac
et al. (2018) administered a nine-item self-report sapiosexuality questionnaire (e.g.,
Threshold effects
15
 ‘Listening to someone speak very intelligently arouses me sexually.’) to a mixture of two
samples of relatively young adults (university students and general community members
less than 40 years old) and found that only between 1% and 8% of people reported
elevated levels of intelligence in another person to be sexually arousing.
Effects of gender
The only notable effects due to gender were the small interactions with relationship type
across the IQ and kindness mate characteristics. Given the nature of the percentile scales,
however, the interactions in this case simply imply that females value IQ and kindness in a
prospective partner somewhat more than males. That is, at relatively low levels of IQ and
kindness, females rate the desirability of the prospective partner lower than males, and at
relativelyhigh levels of IQ and kindness, the females rate the desirability of the prospective
partner higher than males. Gignac et al. (2018) failed to identify any statistically
significant gender effects, based on a sample which included a mixture of university
students and members of the broader community. Notwithstanding the possibility that
small gender differences may have large consequences (Buss, 2013), the results of this
investigation, in combination with those of Gignac et al. (2018), may be considered at
odds with the parental investment theory of sexual selection (Trivers, 1972) and the
modified parental investment theory of sexual selection (Kenrick, Sadalla, Groth, & Trost,
1990). Instead, the results of this investigation suggest that males and females are
essentially similar with respect to their ratings of desirability for a prospective mate, at
least with respect to intelligence, physical attraction, easygoingness, and kindness. In
contrast to the parental investment theory, it may be suggested that the results of this
investigation are consistent with the mutual mate choice (MMC) model of mate selection,
which posits that both males and females participate substantively in the mate sexual
selection process, rather than the male-compete/female-choose (MCFC) model of sexual
selection (see Stewart-Williams & Thomas, 2013). It should be emphasized, however, that
this investigation only measured ratings of desirability, rather than actual decisions to
engage in a relationship with another person.
Objective and subjective intelligence
This investigation failed to observe any statistically significant effects between TBAI and
desirability ratings of IQ in a prospective partner, essentially consistent with Gignac et al.
(2018). Thus, the results failed to support the attraction-similarity hypothesis (Clore &
Byrne, 1974). The results also failed to support the perceived attraction-similarity
hypothesis (Berg & Clark, 1986), as the association between SAI and desirability ratings of
IQ in a prospective partner was not found to be significant. Although the results of this
investigation are at odds with the meta-analytically estimated correlation of .49 between
perceived similarity (no previous interaction) and interpersonal attraction (Montoya
et al., 2008), we note that the majority of the studies conducted, to date, pertain to
attitudes/values, not intelligence. Although further research is encouraged, the absence
of effect between objective/subjective intelligence and ratings of attractiveness of
various levels of IQ may question a simple account for how the assortative mating for IQ
arises.
For example, people are more likely to mate/partner with people in relatively close
proximity to themselves (residential propinquity; Katz & Hill, 1958; Haandrikman, van
Wissen, & Harmsen, 2011). Correspondingly, young adults can be expected to meet
16
Gilles E. Gignac and Clare L. Starbuck
 prospective mates/partners in college/university (Ganguli, Hausmann, & Viarengo,
2014), which is populated by people with relatively higher IQs. Thus, akin to the third
variable problem, assortative mating for education may account, wholly or in part, for the
moderate positive correlation between the IQ scores of spouses (Vandenberg, 1972).
Thus, in practice, assortative mating for IQ may arise for reasons not directly related to
how intelligent people are or consider themselves to be.
Limitations
Although the sample size used in this investigation was reasonably large (power = .84 to
detect r = |.20| effect size as significant statistically), it was composed entirely of first-
year undergraduate students enrolled in a first-year psychology unit. Such sample
homogeneity likely restricted the objectively measured intelligence variance to some
degree, which would have reduced the chances of detecting statistically significant
effects for the self-reported IQ and objectively measured IQ variables. Although we
acknowledge this limitation, we note the key effects reported in Figure 4 were estimated
at .00; thus, it is unlikely that the availability of the full range of IQ scores would have
altered the results in any meaningful way. However, it is possible that the association
between rater objective intelligence and ratings of desirability of IQ is larger in the
portion of the population with an objectively measured IQ between 70 and 90 (i.e., non-
linear). Further research with people at the low to very low end of the IQ distribution
(IQ < 85) is encouraged.
In addition, it should also be noted that some ceiling effects were observed for the
kindness mate characteristic. Specifically, with respect to the 90th and 99th percentiles,
the rated means (partner interest) were 5.01 and 5.13, respectively (theoretical
maximum = 6.0). Thus, it is possible that a more extensive and refined Likert scale
(e.g., 10-point scale) may facilitate the observation of statistically significant increases in
mean rated desirability for the kindness mate characteristic.
Finally, it should be acknowledged that a typical person may not be able to appreciate
the distinction between levels of intelligence that are greater than 90% versus 99% of the
population. Furthermore, some participants may not have had many occasions to interact
meaningfully with people with very elevated levels of intelligence (or physical attraction).
We also acknowledge that the ratings of preferences may have been influenced, to some
degree, by socially desirable responding (e.g., impression management and/or self-
deceptive enhancement; Paulhus, 2002), which may have affected the validity of the
responses. Thus, the results of this investigation should be interpreted cautiously, as there
was likely some degree of disconnection between what raters may have been thinking and
what was implied by their responses to the questionnaire. All things considered the results
should be regarded as relatively preliminary.
Conclusion
Many mate characteristics have been established to be valued highly in a prospective
partner. However, based on more continuous measurement, it is becoming increasingly
established that several mate characteristics are associated with a threshold effect.
However, individual difference predictors of rated preferences in a prospective mate
remain largely unknown.
