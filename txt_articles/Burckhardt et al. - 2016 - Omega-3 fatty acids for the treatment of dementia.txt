Background
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) from fish and plant sources are commonly considered as a promising non-
medical alternative to improve brain functions and slow down the progression of dementia. This assumption is mostly based on
findings of preclinical studies and epidemiological research. Resulting explanatory models aim at the role omega-3 PUFAs play in the
development and integrity of the brain’s neurons, their protective antioxidative effect on cell membranes and potential neurochemical
mechanisms directly related to Alzheimer-specific pathology. Epidemiological research also found evidence of malnutrition in people
with dementia. Considering this and the fact that omega-3 PUFA cannot be synthesised by humans, omega-3 PUFAs might be a
promising treatment option for dementia.
Objectives
To assess the efficacy and safety of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation for the treatment of people with
dementia.
Search methods
We searched the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (ALOIS), MEDLINE, EMBASE,
PsycINFO, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) portal/ICTRP on 10 December 2015. We
contacted manufacturers of omega-3 supplements and scanned reference lists of landmark papers and included articles.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which omega-3 PUFA in the form of supplements or enriched diets were ad-
ministered to people with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), Parkinson’s disease
dementia (PDD) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
Data collection and analysis
The primary outcome measures of interest were changes in global and specific cognitive functions, functional performance, dementia
severity and adverse effects. Two review authors independently selected studies, extracted data and assessed the quality of trials according
to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We rated the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We
received unpublished data from the trial authors and collected adverse effects information from the published articles. We conducted
meta-analyses for available outcome measures at six months.

 Main results
We included three comparable randomised, placebo-controlled trials investigating omega-3 PUFA supplements in 632 participants
with mild to moderate AD over six, 12 and 18 months. We found no studies investigating other types of dementia. All trials were of
high methodological quality. The overall quality of evidence for most of the outcomes was high.
There was no evidence of a benefit from omega-3 PUFAs on cognitive function when measured at six months with the Alzheimer’s
Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.02, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.19 to
0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; high quality evidence) or Mini-Mental State Examination (mean difference (MD) 0.18, 95% CI -
1.05 to 1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence) or on activities of daily living (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.16; 544
participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence). There was also no effect at six months of treatment on severity of dementia measured
with the Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.57; 542 participants; 2 studies; high quality evidence)
or on quality of life measured with the Quality of Life Alzheimer’s Disease scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.08; 322 participants;
1 study; high quality evidence). There was no difference at six months on mental health measured with the Montgomery-Åsberg
Depression Rating Scale (MD -0.10, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants: 1 study; high quality of evidence) or the Neuropsychiatric
Inventory (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants; 2 studies; high quality of evidence). One very small study showed
a benefit for omega-3 PUFAs in instrumental activities of daily living after 12 months of treatment (MD -3.50, 95% CI -4.30 to -
2.70; 22 participants; moderate quality evidence). The included studies did not measure specific cognitive function. The studies did
not report adverse events well. Two studies stated that all adverse events were mild and that they did not differ in overall frequency
between omega-3 PUFA and placebo groups. Data from one study showed no difference between groups in frequency of any adverse
event (risk ratio (RR) 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants; 1 study; moderate quality evidence) or any serious adverse event
(RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study; high quality evidence) at 18 months of treatment.
Authors’ conclusions
We found no convincing evidence for the efficacy of omega-3 PUFA supplements in the treatment of mild to moderate AD. This result
was consistent for all outcomes relevant for people with dementia. Adverse effects of omega-3 PUFAs seemed to be low, but based
on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot make a final statement on tolerability. The effects on other populations remain
unclear.

Omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementia
Background
Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFAs) are assumed to have a beneficial effect on the function of the brain. It has been
suggested that they might improve or delay decline in memory and ability to carry out everyday tasks in people with dementia. In this
review, we investigated randomised controlled trials (clinical studies where people are randomly put into one of two or more treatment
groups) comparing omega-3 PUFAs, given in the form of supplements or enriched diets, with placebo (a pretend treatment) in people
with the most common types of dementia.
Included trials
We included three trials that investigated 632 people with Alzheimer’s disease of mild to moderate severity. We found no trials on other
types of dementia. In all trials participants took either placebo or omega-3 PUFA supplements. The quality of the trials was good. The
participants were allocated to the groups randomly. The participants and most of the investigators did not know which treatment was
given.
Results
When we combined the results of the trials, we found that taking omega-3 PUFA supplements for six months had no effect on cognition
(learning and understanding), everyday functioning, quality of life or mental health. One very small study observed that omega-3
PUFAs improved cognitively complex daily activities, such as shopping, when taken for a longer period of time. However, the quality
of the evidence was only moderate, so this should be confirmed in further trials. Omega-3 PUFAs also had no effect on ratings of the
overall severity of the illness. The trials did not report side effects very well, but none of the studies reported significant harmful effects
on health.

 Conclusion
Altogether, the quality of the evidence was moderate or high for most of the effects that we measured, but we found no evidence for
either benefit or harm from omega-3 PUFA supplements in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. The effects on people
with other types of dementia remain unclear.

Description of the condition
The number of people living with dementia is increasing due to
the ageing world population (United Nations 2013), with higher
age being the major risk factor for the disease. In 2012, 35 million
people were estimated to be affected worldwide. This number will
double by 2030 resulting in high costs and considerable burden
to individuals and societies (WHO 2012).
The term ’dementia’ refers to a group of diseases that share a syn-
drome of typically chronic and progressive nature. The dementia
syndrome involves disturbances of multiple higher cortical func-
tions, such as memory, thinking, orientation, perception and be-
haviour, which are severe enough to affect the ability to perform
everyday activities. Cognitive decline is often accompanied by de-
terioration in emotional control, social behaviour or motivation.
The mostcommonformsof dementiaare Alzheimer’sdisease (AD)
(60% to 70% of cases), vascular dementia (VaD), dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB), dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PDD) and
frontotemporal dementia (FTD).
The early stages of the disease are typically characterised by for-
getfulness, communication problems and difficulties in carrying
out complex activities. In the middle stage, the symptoms be-
come more obvious and people gradually lose the ability to care
for themselves without considerable support. In the late or severe
stages of dementia, people are dependent on others for all care, and
psychiatric and behavioural symptoms are increasingly common
(WHO 2012).
Medical treatments for dementia are limited. Licensed medica-
tions are available only for dementia due to AD and PDD and
these have only modest benefits for symptoms. Many people are
interested in non-medical options to slow down cognitive decline.
These include lifestyle modifications and the reduction of modi-
fiable risk factors (WHO 2012). Data from Larson 2013 indicate
that the incidence of dementia may be falling, which supports the
theory that individual risk might be modifiable. Currently, regular
physical exercise, sleep hygiene, mental training and a healthy diet
are often recommended to maintain a good physical and cognitive
condition (Barnard 2014). Furthermore, there is a growing body
of research indicating that malnutrition, which is strongly associ-
ated with cognitive decline, is a common problem of people with
dementia (Reuther 2013; Roque 2013; Vellas 2005). Dietary rec-
ommendations for people with AD aim at a healthy balanced diet
containing vegetables, legumes, fruits and whole grains (Barnard
2014). It is hoped that nutritional interventions might be a rea-
sonable approach to delay the progression of the disease.
Description of the intervention
Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 PU-
FAs) play a major role in human organs and their function. They
are involved in inflammatory and immunological processes and
hormonal regulation. Furthermore, they are a component of neu-
ronal membranes and involved in the development and function
of the brain (Su 2010).
The human body cannot synthesise omega-3 PUFAs. There-
fore, they are classified as essential fatty acids. The most com-
mon omega-3 PUFAs are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3),
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3) and alpha-linolenic acid
(ALA, 18:3n-3). Chemically, fatty acids chains consist of carbon
atoms with a carboxylic end (’alpha’) and methyl end (’omega’).
The first number of the chemical name refers to the number of
carbons in the carbon chain. It is followed by the number of dou-
ble bonds and their position counting from the omega end of the
chain (i.e. ’n-3’ refers to the C=C double bond at position three).
Natural sources of EPA and DHA are algae, oily fish (e.g. salmon,
mackerel, herring or sardines) and fish oils. In plants, the most
common ALA is found in vegetable oils (e.g. canola, flax seed oil,
soybean oil) and nuts (e.g. walnuts). Humans cannot synthesise
ALA, but it can be partially metabolised into EPA and DHA (FAO
2010). Nutritional supplements containing oils rich in omega-3
PUFAs are also available. There is broad scientific consensus about
the importance of food sources rich in omega-3 PUFAs to main-
tain healthy body function. However, the evidence on the support-
ive role of additional supplements is still insufficient (Campbell
2013; EFSA 2010; Hooper 2004). This applies in particular to
the prevention of dementia (Sydenham 2012).
The human body has a limited storage capacity of PUFAs in adi-
pose tissue, which implies their regular consumption (Arterburn
2006). Most guidelines recommend a daily intake of 250 to 1000
mg of EPA plus DHA to meet the requirements of a healthy diet
in adults. An adequate intake of ALA is generally expressed as
’percentage of total dietary energy (E%)’ (EFSA 2010) and usu-
ally defined to be 0.5E% to 1.0E% (Aranceta 2012; EFSA 2010).
However dietary reference values and guideline recommendations
vary across the world (Aranceta 2012; EFSA 2012). The optimal
amounts for the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases are
not well established (Micha 2014). Experts state that the recom-
mended amounts of omega-3 PUFAs can be consumed as part of
a balanced diet with a regular intake of fish (EFSA 2010). For ex-
ample, an intake of 500 mg of EPA plus DHA can be achieved by
consuming two portions (90 g) of oily fish per week (FAO 2010).
Nevertheless, omega-3 PUFA supplements are among the most
consumedof dietarysupplementsintendedtoimprove ormaintain
overall health (Bailey 2013; Dickinson 2014). Even though cur-
rent data show an overall increase of the consumption of polyun-
saturated fats, people in most countries consume less than the
recommended amount (EFSA 2012; Micha 2014). Supplements
with combined doses of DHA and EPA up to 5 g/day, EPA alone
up to 1.8 g/day or DHA up to 1 g/day for adults do not raise safety
concerns of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA 2012).

 How the intervention might work
Omega-3 PUFAs are involved in the structure and function of
cell membrane phospholipid fractions in the brain (Cansev 2008),
and are assumed to play an important role in cognitive processes.
Several hypotheses have been presented to explain how the dietary
intake of omega-3 PUFAs might influence the cognitive perfor-
mance of people with dementia.
First, maintaining adequate levels of omega-3 PUFAs may support
the development and integrity of the brain’s neurons and enhance
synaptic plasticity (Cansev 2008; Su 2010). Research shows a risk
of malnutrition in people with dementia (Reuther 2013; Roque
2013; Vellas 2005), which indicates that vulnerable people in par-
ticular can benefit from additional administration of omega-3 PU-
FAs. Findings of decreased fatty acids in plasma within this pop-
ulation might support this idea (Lin 2012; Lopes da Silva 2013).
Second, omega-3 PUFAs have anti-oxidative and anti-inflamma-
tory effects (Molfino 2014; Vedin 2012). Especially in the ageing
brain, this characteristic may contribute to the protection of neu-
rons and prevent cellular death.
Third, Morris and Tangne have argued in their review that the fatty
acid composition of the diet is an important determinant of blood
cholesterol, which in turn seems to play a role in the pathology
of AD (Morris 2014). For example, apolipoprotein-E (ApoE) is
involved in the transport of cholesterol and the ApoE-ǫ4 allele is an
important risk factor for AD (Morris 2014). Furthermore, there is
growing evidence that serum cholesterol is strongly associated with
the deposition of β-amyloid in the human brain (Reed 2014).
Finally, it has also been suggested that omega-3 PUFAs may be
directly related to the decrease of AD-specific pathology (e.g. Aβ
levels) (Cole 2009; Su 2010). This hypothesis is supported to some
extent by preclinical studies, and a wide range of models describing
potential neurochemical mechanismshave beenoutlined(Murphy
2014; Su 2010).
Why it is important to do this review
Omega-3 PUFAs have become increasingly important in several
dietary recommendations. It is widely theorised that they slow
cognitive decline in people with dementia. Considering the enor-
mous impact of dementia on quality of life (QoL) and the lim-
ited treatment possibilities, a safe and effective dietary interven-
tion would be of great interest to people with dementia. With this
review, we aimed to assist them in their decision regarding dietary
supplementation with omega-3 PUFAs.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Since dementia
is a progressive disease, we included only the data of the first period
of cross-over randomised trials.
Types of participants
We included people diagnosed with AD, VaD, DLB, PDD and
FTD. The diagnosis of dementia should have been made in ac-
cordance with accepted guidelines, such as the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (APA 1987; APA 1994;
APA 2013), the International Classification of Diseases (ICD;
WHO 1992; WHO 2010), the National Institute of Neuro-
logical and Communicative Disorders and Stroke (NINCDS)-
Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association (ADRDA)
Alzheimer’s Criteria (McKhann 2011) or the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke and Association Internationale
pour la Recherché et l’Enseignement en Neurosciences (NINDS-
AIREN) Criteria for the Diagnosis of Vascular Dementia (Román
1993).
AD and VaD are the most common types of dementia (WHO
2012). Therefore, we intended to evaluate studies in which the
participants were diagnosed with dementia, even if the types of
dementia were not specified. However, we found only studies in-
vestigating omega-3 PUFAs in people diagnosed with AD.
We considered any stages and severity of dementia. Participants
may have been recruited from any setting.
Types of interventions
We evaluated the following interventions:
• Omega-3 PUFA capsules as a dietary supplement versus
placebo. We considered a supplement as appropriate for
inclusion if its main active ingredient was omega-3 PUFA;
• Diets enriched with omega-3 PUFAs in specific portions
versus usual diet.
We considered any dosage of administration if the study partici-
pants received it on a regular basis (at least weekly) for at least 26
weeks.
We excluded studies that only investigated dietary advice. We also
excluded trials that did not precisely specify the intake of omega-
3 PUFA.

Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We
searched
ALOIS
(www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois)
-
the
Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group’s (CD-
CIG) specialised register on 10 December 2015.
The Trials Search Co-ordinator for the CDCIG maintains ALOIS,
which contains studies that fall within the areas of dementia pre-
vention, dementia treatment and management, and cognitive en-
hancement in healthy elderly populations. The studies are identi-
fied through:
• monthly searches of several major healthcare databases:
MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and Lilacs;
• monthly searches of several trial registers: ISRCTN; UMIN
(Japan’s Trial Register); the World Health Organization (WHO)
portal (which covers ClinicalTrials.gov; ISRCTN; the Chinese
Clinical Trials Register; the German Clinical Trials Register; the
Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials and the Netherlands National
Trials Register, and others);
• quarterly search of the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL);
• six-monthly searches of several grey literature sources: ISI
Web of Knowledge Conference Proceedings; Index to Theses;
Australasian Digital Theses.
To view a list of all sources searched for ALOIS see About ALOIS
on the ALOIS website (www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/alois).
The ’methods used in reviews’ section within the editorial infor-
mation about the CDCIG shows details of the search strategies
run in healthcare bibliographic databases that we use for the re-
trieval of reports of dementia, cognitive improvement and cogni-
tive enhancement trials.
We ran additional searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO,
CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO portal/ICTRP to en-
sure that the search was as comprehensive and as up-to-date as
possible. Appendix 1 shows the search strategy.
Searching other resources
We contacted the following manufacturers of omega-3 PUFA
products and organisations for overlooked, unpublished and on-
going trials:
• Global Organization for EPA and DHA Omega-3s, USA;
• Arjuna Natural Extracts Limited, India;
• FMC Health and Nutrition Epax International, Norway;
• Nordic Naturals, USA;
• DSM Nutritional Products, Netherlands;
• WHC Health Consulting, Belgium;
• Carlson Laboratories, USA;
• OmegaVia, USA;
• Ocean Blue Professional, USA;
• Prevention Pharmaceuticals, USA;
• NeuroBioPharm Inc, USA.
We reviewed reference lists of included studies, trial registries and
conference abstracts, and contacted authors of landmark papers
for overlooked, unpublished and ongoing trials.

 Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
We managed all references retrieved by the searches using End-
Note (X5) (EndNote 2011). The Trials Search Co-ordinator of the
CDCIG removed duplications of the same references. Afterwards,
two review authors (MB and MH or MB and AF) independently
examined titles and abstracts to identify eligible studies. If it was
not clear whether a study was relevant, we made the decision based
on the full text. Two review authors (MB and MH) evaluated full
texts of relevant articles independently according to the eligibility
criteria. They were not blinded to study data. We resolved dis-
agreements by involving a third review author. We listed final de-
cisions for the exclusion of articles that we retrieved in full text in
the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
We planned to translate full texts that were not in English or
German, and if necessary employ translation services. However, as
all eligible studies were already presented in English this was not
necessary. We linked multiple reports and conference abstracts of
the same study together.
Data extraction and management
Two review authors (MB and MH) independently read and ex-
tracted the data presented in the respective article. In case of dis-
crepancies, we involved a third review author until we reached
consensus.
We used an electronic data extraction form, including source, el-
igibility, methods, participants, interventions, comparators, out-
comes, results and miscellaneous notes according to the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a).
In addition, we assessed details of funding source, declarations of
interest of the primary investigators and methods used to control
possible conflicts of interests. Two review authors pre-tested the
form using the first two studies and adapted afterwards.
For continuous data, we extracted the mean value of the outcome
measurement in each group (or, if this was not available, the mean
change from baseline), the standard deviation (SD) and the num-
ber of participants used to measure the outcome for each group.
For dichotomous outcomes, we extracted the number of partici-
pants in each outcome group. If the data provided were insuffi-
cient, we attempted to obtain the omitted information from the
authors of the report (see the section Dealing with missing data).
One review author (MB) entered the data into Review Manager 5
(RevMan 2014). A second review author (MH) checked the data
for accuracy. We also extracted data from ongoing studies includ-
ing study name, methods, participants, interventions, outcomes,
starting date, contact information and notes.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias for each
study, using the Cochrane tool for assessing risk of bias (Higgins
2011b). We resolved any disagreements by discussion.
We described the risk of bias of all included studies in the
Characteristics of included studies table and narrative. In addi-
tion, we provided an overall judgement of included studies by a
’Risk of bias’ summary (see Figure 1). To prevent undue industry
influence during the clinical trial process, we explicitly considered
the appropriateness of all methods used. Therefore, we assessed
additional criteria, which are presented in detail in Table 1. An
overall rating on how these findings might have influenced the
presented study results were considered as ’other bias’ in the ’Risk
of bias’ tables.

 Measures of treatment effect
We used mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences
(SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for continuous out-
comes, and risk ratios (RR) with 95% CIs for the analysis of di-
chotomous outcomes.
To date, no ranges for commonly accepted minimal clinically
important differences (MCID) exist for most of the scales used
to measure outcomes in people with dementia (IQWIG 2013;
Molnar 2009; Schrag 2012; US Preventive Task Force 2014; Vellas
2008). We intended to present the proportion of participants with
changes in the scale measures of the primary outcomes (i.e. more
or less than 4 scale points for ADAS-Cog) if data were available.
However, considering the small insignificant effects, we did not
request that data from the study authors.
Scales that are commonly used in dementia trials are often coded
ordinally. We treated the data measured with scales comprising
of more than 10 categories as continuous variables assuming a
normal distribution.
Unit of analysis issues
The unit of analysis was the person with dementia. As defined in
our protocol, we analysed only the first period of cross-over trials
considering the progressive nature of dementia. We intended to
use comparable time points (± one week) for all meta-analyses.
Therefore, we conducted meta-analyses from six-month measure-
ment data, which we were able to get from all trials.
Dealing with missing data
We contacted trial authors requesting missing information or
to clarify any remaining ambiguity. All authors replied to our
queries. We received unpublished data from two trials (Quinn
2010; Shinto 2014), and were able to clarify most questions with
all trial authors. However, we were not able to obtain data from the
OmegAD trial concerning data to adverse effects from each group
(Freund-Levi 2006). We considered this issue in the appraisal of
the risk of bias.
None of the trials were able to assess the outcomes of all included
participants. One trial used the last observation carried forward
(LOCF) approach but did not publish the results, reasoning that
the LOCF results did not differ from the per protocol analyses
(Freund-Levi 2006).
Two trials used logistic regression models to predict missing data
over time (Quinn 2010; Shinto 2014). Quinn 2010 also presented
some sensitivity analysis with multiple imputations. We described
these results additionally as reported by the trial authors.
We also considered missing data by conducting sensitivity analysis
(see Sensitivity analysis).
Assessment of heterogeneity
We evaluated clinical heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity
using Chi2 and I2 statistics.
Assessment of reporting biases
We tried to minimise reporting bias by inclusion of published and
unpublished trials. Therefore, we compared conference abstracts
and registered trials with published data. According to the trials
registries, we found two studies that were completed but not pub-
lished and contacted the responsible organisation or the researcher
for more information (see Description of studies). We found no
further indication of unpublished trials. It was not reasonable to
perform a funnel plot and Egger’s test for asymmetry (Egger1997),
since we included only three trials.
Data synthesis
We observed no considerable statistical heterogeneity and con-
ducted fixed-effect meta-analyses to estimate an overall treatment
effect. We performed all meta-analyses by using Review Manager 5
(RevMan 2014). We combined outcomes measured with the same
scales, by presenting MDs. When different or modified scales were
used to measure the same construct, we used the SMD for the
meta-analysis. A precondition for this was that the same domains
(i.e. global cognitive function) or subdomain (e.g. memory) were
assessed.
Due to the progressive nature of dementia, we assumed that LOCF
and per protocol analyses had a comparable distorting impact on
the results. Therefore, we considered both in our meta-analyses.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
In the protocol for this review (Burckhardt 2015), we planned to
conduct subgroup analyses of dementia subtype and stage, baseline
nutritional status and dose of intervention. However, we included
only three studies. All these included participants with mild to
moderate AD. Analysing subgroups by the dosage was not rea-
sonable either, because all study interventions were in a range of
omega-3 PUFAs 1.75 to 2.3 g in total. One study conducted sub-
group analysis on MMSE and CDR-SOB (Quinn 2010). How-
ever, they did not adjust their testing to multiple comparisons,
which might bias the results. We presented the results briefly in
the Effects of interventions section. None of the studies conducted
subgroup analysis based on nutritional status. We investigated het-
erogeneity in terms of participants and omega-3 PUFA dosage.
We presented the main baseline characteristics and interventions
in Table 2.

 Sensitivity analysis
We were only able to conduct our meta-analyses by using means
(or mean changes), which were observed (per protocol) or partially
summarised over time (LOCF). Since dementia is a progressive
disease, this might overestimate the effect in favour of omega-3
PUFAs. As pre-defined in our protocol, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis using single imputation methods. We assumed that the
mean and SD of the missing observations from both groups cor-
responded to those of the observed cases in the control group. For
the ADAS-Cog, we combined the assumed group results with the
observed data with R statistics by using the formula for combining
groups presented in Chapter 7.7. of the Cochrane Handbook for
Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011a). Due to the
clear results and the similarity of the trials, we did not consider
it necessary to perform further sensitivity analyses including im-
puted data.
We further decided to perform sensitivity analyses pooling MMSE
and ADAS-Cog results at the end of the treatment from all three
trials, irrespective of study duration.
Presentation of results - ’Summary of findings’ tables
We used the GRADE approach to interpret the findings (Guyatt
2011), and presented them in ’Summary of findings’ tables as
recommended by Cochrane (Schünemann 2011). Together with
our consumer group, we prioritised the above defined outcomes.
For that purpose, we conducted a small study involving people
with early dementia, their relatives, nurses, and physicians of a
geriatric ward. Data collection took place from May until Novem-
ber 2015 in the Department of Psychiatry, Psychotherapy and Psy-
chosomatics of the University Hospital Halle (UKH). All partici-
pants were asked to take part in this survey anonymously. A simple
questionnaire presented treatment outcomes in an understandable
way. We asked the recipients to mark their subjective importance
of each outcome on a 9-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (unim-
portant) to 9 (important).
We collected 37 questionnaires from 14 people with dementia,
12 relatives and 11 staff members. However, in most cases the
treatment goals were rated high and, therefore, resulted in a re-
duced variance in item scores. People with dementia, relatives and
staff did not differ significantly in their evaluation, which is surely
caused by the low sample size and the small variance within the
ratings. In the total sample, low adverse effects of medication were
rated most important, followed by enhancement of QoL, balanced
state of mind, enhancement of general cognition, enhancement
of memory and enhancement of instrumental activities of daily
living (IADL). Enhancement of self care (ADL) was rated least
important in the total sample as well as with people with dementia
and relatives (see Table 3).
We imported data of the meta-analyses by using the GRADEpro
GDT to create ’Summary of findings’ tables. These included for
each outcome: the estimate of the treatment effect, the quantity
of supporting evidence and the quality of that evidence assessed
using the GRADE approach (Guyatt 2011). Two review authors
(MB and GL) used the recommended approach to downgrade the
evidence from ’high quality’ by one level for serious (or by two
for very serious) study limitations (risk of bias), indirectness of
evidence, serious inconsistency, imprecision of effect estimates or
potential publication bias.
We included the outcomes in the ’Summary of findings’ tables
in the order that our consumer group prioritised them (Table 3).
We did not ask for global measurements that included cognition
and function. However, cognition and function were both rated
as critical treatment goals. Therefore, we included results of the
CDR-SOB as well.

Description of studies
Results of the search
The electronic searches from March and December 2015 re-
trieved 3064 results. Afterde-duplication by Anna Noel-Storr, Tri-
als Search Coordinator of the CDCIG, two review authors (MB
and MH or MB and AF) independently assessed the remaining
2331 references for relevance. We identified one further reference
by scanning the reference lists of landmark papers and included
studies. We received no information for further published or un-
published studies by experts or manufacturers. We discarded 2299
references that were not relevant. Two review authors (MB and
MH) independently assessed 31 articles and conference abstracts
for eligibility. Seven articles and two registered trials did not meet
our inclusion criteria (see Characteristics of excluded studies ta-
ble). We included 24 articles referring to three trials (Freund-Levi
2006; Quinn 2010; Shinto 2014). The selection process is pre-
sented in the PRISMA statement (Liberati 2009) (see Figure 2).

 Included studies
Three trials met the inclusion criteria for this review (Freund-Levi
2006; Quinn 2010; Shinto 2014), and 632 participants were ran-
domised in total. Clinically, the included studies were comparable
with respect to the participants (mild to moderate AD) and dosage
of the intervention (EPA plus DHA between 1750 and 2300 mg/
day). The mean values of nutritional parameters presented in the
studies, indicated no malnutrition, lack of DHA or other rele-
vant baseline characteristics (Table 2). The trials had a consider-
able variation in duration. For most of the primary and secondary
outcomes, the trial authors sent us the results from six months’
follow-up, which we combined in meta-analyses. Statistically, we
observed no relevant heterogeneity by using Chi2 and I2 statistics.
The largest trial investigated omega-3 PUFAs in a parallel-group
design over a study period of 18 months with the primary aim
of cognitive and functional outcomes (Quinn 2010). It was spon-
sored by the Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS) in co-
operation with the National Institute of Aging (NIA) and DSM
Nutritional Products. DSM Nutritional Products is a leading sup-
plier of nutritional supplements. The trial is also referred to as the
ADCS-NIA trial. Dr. Joseph Quinn provided some unpublished
data (Table 4).
The second largest trial, named the OmegAD study, was a cross-
over design trial of 12 months’ duration sponsored by the Karolin-
ska University Hospital in Sweden (Freund-Levi 2006). The pri-
mary aim was to test efficacy of omega-3 PUFAs on cognition.
We included the results of the first period after a follow-up of six
months.
The third trial was a small pilot study with a three-arm parallel
design (Shinto 2014). Its primary aim was to evaluate the effects
of omega-3 PUFAs alone or in combination with alpha lipoic acid
on oxidative stress parameters. We included the study’s secondary,
but patient-relevant, outcomes on the comparison of omega-3
PUFA versus placebo. Dr. Lynne Shinto provided unpublished six
months data (Table 5), which we used for the meta-analyses. The
trial lasted 12 months and was sponsored by the Oregon Health
and Science University in the USA and conducted in collabora-
tion with NIA and the National Center for Complementary and
Integrative Health (NCCIH).
In addition to the Characteristics of included studies table, we
presented an overview of the main baseline characteristics, inter-
ventions and outcomes of all three studies in Table 2.
We did not identify any trials investigating omega-3 PUFAs in
people with other types of dementia. We also found no trials in-
vestigating diets enriched with omega-3 PUFAs.
Participants
The number of randomised men and women ranged from 26 to
402 with a range of mean age from 73.5 to 76 years. All trials were
restricted to people with AD diagnosed with established criteria ac-
cording to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disor-
ders (DSM-IV: Freund-Levi 2006) or NINCDS-ADRDA criteria
(Quinn 2010; Shinto 2014). The severity of the disease was mild
to moderate ranging from an MMSE of 23.6 (Freund-Levi 2006)
down to 20.66 (Quinn 2010), and the majority of the participants
received a stable dose of cholinesterase inhibitors or memantine.
All trials defined pre-study intake of omega-3 supplements as an
exclusion criterion. The ADCS-NIA trial also excluded partici-
pants who consumed on average DHA more than 200 mg/day in
the form of food (Quinn 2010).
Two of the trials took place in the USA (Quinn 2010; Shinto
2014), and one in Sweden (Freund-Levi 2006). All three trial
were conducted in outpatient care. The baseline data showed no
indication of poor nutrition. The mean body mass index ranged
from 24 (SD 3) (Freund-Levi 2006) to 26 (SD 4) (Quinn 2010).
The baseline data from the blood samples indicated a sufficient
intake of omega-3 PUFAs. Table 2 presents the most relevant
baseline characteristics of all three trials in detail.
Interventions
All participants received omega-3 PUFAs as 1 g capsules contain-
ing various amounts of omega-3 PUFAs versus placebo. In the
OmegAD trial, participants consumed the highest dose of omega-
3 PUFAs with a combination of DHA 1.7 g and EPA 0.6 g (de-
rived from fish oil) provided in four capsules per day (Freund-Levi
2006). The capsules further contained vitamin E (tocopherol) 4
mg as a preservative. In the ADCS-NIA trial, two capsules of an
algal-derived DHA were provided daily (Quinn 2010). This veg-
etarian source of omega-3 PUFAs contained no EPA but approx-
imately 45% to 55% of DHA by weight. This means that the
participants received a daily dose of around DHA 900 to 1100 mg
daily. In the trial of Shinto 2014, participants were recommended
to ingest three lemon-flavoured fish oil concentrate capsules with
food. The daily dose contained DHA 675 mg and EPA 975 mg.
All trials analysed blood samples for serum fatty acid levels, which
increased significantly compared to unchanged levels in placebo
groups; this can be interpreted as good compliance for the inter-
vention.
Outcome measures
The trials used the following outcome measures. Table 2 sum-
marises their use in the included studies. For a better interpreta-
tion, we presented related estimates of clinical important changes
as identified in the literature. Appropriate methods for defining
16

 valid estimates of MCIDs are not yet fully developed and for scales,
covering different constructs (i.e. global severity scales), almost im-
possible to determine (Molnar 2009). Furthermore, what is esti-
mated to be a clinically important difference depends on the popu-
lation (i.e. severity of dementia) and contextual characteristics (i.e.
ratio of adverse effects and efficacy) and might vary from different
points of view (i.e. researcher or participant) (Revicki 2008). This
also applies to the following presented estimates of clinical impor-
tant changes. They were developed with varying methods and ad-
dress different circumstances and disease severity. Therefore, they
should be considered with caution.
Global and specific cognitive function cognitive function
measures
• Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) evaluates severity
and progression of cognitive impairment in the five areas of
orientation, immediate recall, attention and calculation, delayed
recall, and language (Folstein 1975). The test score ranges from 0
to 30 with higher scores representing better cognitive function.
The severity of cognitive impairment is usually classified by
MMSE score points such as 20/21 to 26/27 as mild, 10 to 19/20
as moderate, and less than 10 as severe impaired (Hulstaert
2009). MCIDs of 1.4 to 3.7 score points are commonly
estimated (corresponds to the estimates of Burback 1999; Hensel
2007; Qaseem 2008).
• The Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive
subscale (ADAS-Cog) comprises spoken language ability,
comprehension of spoken language, recall of test instructions,
word finding difficulty, following commands, naming objects,
construction drawing, ideational praxis, orientation, word recall
and word recognition. The score ranges from 0 to 70, with a
higher score indicating a greater impairment (Rosen 1984).
MCID is mainly estimated between 2 and 4 score points
(Huntley 2015; Molnar 2009; Schrag 2012; Vellas 2008). The
OmegAD trial used an extended version of the ADAS-Cog (scale
range 0 to 85) (Mohs 1997).
• None of the studies presented specific cognitive function
measures (i.e. memory).
Functional outcome measures (e.g. activities of daily living)
• The Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of
Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) was specifically designed as part of a
comprehensive test battery to assess ADL living in people with
AD in clinical trials (Galasko 1997). It consists of 23 criteria
comprising simple everyday skills and complex activities, which
are rated based on an interview with an informant who knows
the affected study participant well. The range is from 0 to 78
with a higher score indicating a lower interference. Data on
MCID for ADCS-ADL are limited. One study group defined a
threshold of a 2 point score change as meaningful in an RCT
investigating vitamin E and memantine in mild to moderate AD
(Dysken 2014).
• The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD) evaluates
the performance of daily function in community-dwelling
people with dementia based on carer information (Gelinas
1999). The instrument evaluates initiation, planning and
execution of simple and complex activities. A final score is
formed by a percentage of all questions rated positive, indicating
that the study participant is able to perform the respective task
without help. Therefore, lower scores indicate more dysfunction.
We found no estimates of a meaningful change.
• The Older Americans Resources and Services - Activities of
Daily Living (OARS-ADL) Questionnaire (Fillenbaum 1975;
George 1985) is a part of a multidimensional functional
assessment (Fillenbaum 1981). According to Dr. Shinto
(personal communication), the pilot trial used a modified
version with score ranges from 0 to 27 for ADL and 0 to 14 for
IADL (Shinto 2014). A lower score indicates a better function.
We found no estimates of a meaningful change.
Overall dementia severity measures
• The Clinical Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SOB)
is a semi-structured interview of people with dementia and
informants for the assessment of cognition (memory, orientation,
judgement/problem solving) and function (community affairs,
home/hobbies, personal care) (O’Bryant 2008). The CDR-SOB
total score ranges from 0 to 18 with scores around 3 to 15.5
indicating mild to moderate dementia (O’Bryant 2008). A
Clinical Dementia Rating - Global score can be derived from the
box scores. We found no estimates of a meaningful change.
Measures of symptoms associated with dementia
• The Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale
(MADRS) is a measure of mental health and was particularly
developed to assess change secondary to treatment of depressive
symptoms (Montgomery 1979). The scale encompasses 10
symptoms associated with depression (i.e. sadness or tension),
the seriousness of which are rated by a clinician based on
observation or reporting after an interview. The total score
ranges from 0 to 60, higher scores indicating more severe
symptoms. The cut-off point for mild depression is usually at 13
points (Müller-Thomsen 2005). MCID estimates range from 1
to 2 points in people with depressive symptoms (Duru 2008).
• The 10-item Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) evaluates
neuropsychiatric disturbance common in dementia and
associated with mental health: delusions, hallucinations,
dysphoria, anxiety, agitation/aggression, euphoria, disinhibition,
irritability/lability, apathy and aberrant motor activity
(Cummings 1994). Scores range from 0 (normal) to 120
17

 (severely disturbed). The 12-item extension also assesses night-
time behavioural disturbances, appetite and eating abnormalities
(score range 0 to 144) (Cummings 1997). The information is
obtained from a person familiar with the patient’s behaviour. A
change of 4 to 8 points is suggested to be clinically meaningful
(Cummings 2015; Howard 2011).
Measures of quality of life
• The Quality of Life Alzheimer’s Disease scale (QoL-AD)
exists in two versions both for people with AD (self reported)
and their informal carers (proxy reported). QoL is assessed in 13
items, covering physical health, energy, mood, memory, living
and financial situation, relationships to life partner, family and
friends, the ability to perform household and leisure activities,
and judgements of one’s self and life as a whole. The total score
ranges from 13 to 52 points with a higher score reflecting a better
QoL (Logsdon 2002). We found no estimates of an MCID.
Adverse events
• Safety and tolerability was a secondary outcome in
Freund-Levi 2006 but it was not reported in detail which
parameters were assessed and how they were measured. The two
other trials did not name adverse events explicitly as an outcome
but presented the most reported adverse events. They were either
reported by the study participants or partners (Shinto 2014), or
it was not clear how they were assessed (Freund-Levi 2006;
Quinn 2010). Serious adverse events, as normally assessed by
data and safety monitoring, were in the ADCS-NIA trial defined
as “...events that result in death, hospitalization, prolongation of
hospitalization, or are life threatening (based on the judgment of
the study physician)” (Quinn 2010).
Some secondary outcomes as defined in the protocol of this review
(Burckhardt 2015), such as compliance with intervention, entry
to institutional care, hospital admissions and mortality, were not
assessed explicitly as outcomes in any of the trials. We considered
the themes in the adverse events and tolerability section.
Quinn 2010 published score changes from baseline adjusted for
baseline MMSE.If five orfeweritemswere missingonADAS-Cog,
those items where imputed based on LOCF methods, on a per
item, per participant basis. Missing score measures over time were
predicted by linear mixed-effects (LME) regression models. In a
sensitivity analysis, they used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
methods using multiple imputation methods. Dr. Quinn provided
us with unpublished total mean values and QoL data, which were
used in the meta-analyses.
Shinto 2014 also published score changes analysed with LME
model. They adjusted for age and education. Dr. Shinto sent us
total mean values from six months’ follow-up, which we used for
the meta-analyses.
Freund-Levi 2006 presented data as observed by presenting MDs.
They also performed an LOCF analysis and stated that the results
were comparable.
Excluded studies
We excluded eight publications and two registered trials and pre-
sented the reasons in the Characteristics of excluded studies table.
The main reasons for exclusion were a duration of intervention of
less than 26 weeks (Chiu 2008), inclusion of participants other
than people with dementia (Hashimoto 2012; Mahmoudi 2014),
or different study design (Terano 1999). According to the trials
registries, we found two studies that were completed but not pub-
lished. We then contacted the responsible organisation or the re-
searcher. The North East London NHS Foundation Trust (UK)
wrote to us, that their trial was not completed due to non-signifi-
cant results and low numbers recruited (Carter 2006). The spon-
sor (NeuroBioPharm Inc) of the other registered trial informed us
that the company was “unable to share any information” with us
at this time (NCT00867828). However, with a planned duration
of treatment of 24 weeks, the trial does most appear to fulfil our
inclusion criteria.
Risk of bias in included studies
Overall, we judged the quality of the trials as high (Figure 1).
There were onlyafewuncertainties(see Characteristics of included
studies table), which we do not think have an important influence
on the overall results.
Allocation
All trial authors provided details of adequate sequence generation
describing computer-generated schemes (Freund-Levi 2006 (re-
ported in Faxen-Irving 2009); Quinn 2010; Shinto 2014).
Blinding
All three trials used adequate blinding methods for participants
by using placebo capsules with an identical appearance. Capsules
were usually swallowed whole, therefore, we did not judge it as
bias that only one trial team made efforts to match the fish-like
smell of omega-3 PUFAs in their placebo capsules (Shinto 2014).
The reports of Quinn 2010 and Shinto 2014 indicated that out-
come assessors were blinded during the whole study duration.
However, it was not clear in the OmegAD study (Freund-Levi
2006) if blinding was maintained long enough to blind the out-
come assessor.
18

 Incomplete outcome data
Quinn 2010 and Shinto 2014 presented numbers and reasons for
participants who withdrew or dropped out. Numbers and reasons
were similar in intervention and control groups. They included
missing data by LMEs models.
In the OmegAD trial, an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis on the
basis of LOCF was carried out but not published, reasoning that
there were no differences to the per-protocol analysis (Freund-Levi
2006).
Selective reporting
Overall, we judged the bias for selective reporting as low. The trials
analysed and presented all primary outcomes as described in the
published trial protocols. We received data to further outcomes as
requested. Secondary outcomes and subgroup analysis of Freund-
Levi 2006 and Quinn 2010 were not congruent in detail with the
published trial protocols, but there was no indication of favourable
reporting of outcomes relevant to this review. However, there were
some inconsistencies with reporting of adverse events. Freund-Levi
2006 presented the reasons for participants leaving the study but
not in regard to their group affiliation. We were not able to get this
information by mail contact with Dr. Freund-Levy. Even though
these incidents were low in numbers, it cannot be excluded that
this might favour omega-3 PUFAs.
Other potential sources of bias
Omega-3 suppliers provided all study drugs. Shinto 2014 reported
having no further conflicts of interest.
A company producing omega-3 PUFAs partly funded the
OmegAD trial (Freund-Levi 2006). An omega-3 supplier was also
involved as a collaborator in the ADCS-NIA trial (Quinn 2010).
Both trial authors reported that industry was involved in study
design and the submission of the publication. Apart from that,
they reported only minor conflicts of interest. However, authors
of both trials explicitly state that industry was not involved in
collection and analysis of study data, which, in our view, is the
most vulnerable part of a trial (Freund-Levi 2006; Quinn 2010).
Considering this and the transparent reporting of all pre-defined
results, we do not judge the reported co-operation with industry as
a relevant source of bias. However, a possible influence of industry
in presenting results cannot be ruled out with certainty.
We do not regard any imbalance of baseline data as relevant for the
outcomes of this review. Furthermore, none of the studies stopped
earlier than planned in the published protocol.
Effects of interventions
See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Omega-3
PUFA supplements compared to placebo for people with mild to
moderate Alzheimer’s disease
There was no therapeutic benefit for all outcomes in people with
mild to moderate AD. This result was irrespective of the omega-3
PUFAs dose, which was between 1.75 and 2.3 g/day. For the meta-
analyses that we conducted for this review, we used published per-
protocol data from the OmegAD trial (Freund-Levi 2006), and
unpublished data that we received from Dr. Quinn (Quinn 2010)
and Dr. Shinto (Shinto 2014).
None of the trials observed any significant effect on any of the
outcomes relevant for this review. Therefore, we have largely re-
frained from presenting all of the effect measures and CIs sep-
arately. This especially applies to the pilot trial of Shinto 2014,
which did not have enough power to detect a difference in any
outcomes relevant to people with AD. We presented results of all
outcomes separately.
Changes in global and specific cognitive function
(primary outcomes)
Freund-Levi 2006, Quinn 2010, and Shinto 2014 assessed the
cognitive function with MMSE and ADAS-Cog.
There was no evidence of a benefit for omega-3 PUFAs compared
to placebo in any of the studies. A meta-analysis based on Freund-
Levi 2006 and Shinto 2014 showed no effect on cognition when
measured with MMSE at six months (MD 0.18, 95% CI -1.05 to
1.41; 202 participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%). We graded the quality
of evidence across the studies as high (Summary of findings for
the main comparison). Figure 3 shows the meta-analysis (Analysis
1.1).

 Figure 3.
Forest plot of comparison: Omega-3 PUFAs versus placebo for mild to moderate Alzheimer’s
disease. Analysis 1.1 Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE; 6 months’ follow-up, PP analysis).
Quinn 2010 assessed cognition with MMSE at a follow-up of
18 months in an ANCOVA analysis that showed no difference
between groups (P value = 0.88). This was consistent with Shinto
2014 where there was no difference (P value = 0.80) at 12 months
in an LME model when adjusted for age and education level.
This result also applied for cognition measured with ADAS-Cog.
We performed a meta-analysis of six months’ data of all trials,
which revealed no significant benefit for omega-3 PUFAs (SMD -
0.02, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.15; 566 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%)
(Analysis 1.2). We judged the quality of evidence across the studies
as high (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
In the ADCS trial, there was no significant difference observed at
18 months’ follow-up when missing data were considered with an
LME model (P value = 0.41) adjusted for baseline MMSE or in
an ANCOVA with data after multiple imputation (P value = 0.99;
unpublished data) (Quinn 2010).
None of the included trials assessed specific cognitive functions.
Changes in functional outcome measures (e.g.
activities of daily living (primary outcome))
A meta-analysis with functional measures on DAD (Freund-Levi
2006) and ADCS-ADL (Quinn 2010) showed no difference at six
months (SMD -0.02, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.16; 544 participants; 2
studies; I2 = 23%) (Analysis 1.3; Figure 4). We rated the quality of
evidence across the studies as high (Summary of findings for the
main comparison).

ADCS-ADL: Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living; DAD: Disability Assessment
for Dementia.
Considering missing data in LME models, this result was consis-
tent when ADL was measured on a modified version of the OARS
at 12 months (P value = 0.82) (Shinto 2014), or on the ADCS-
ADL at 18 months (P value = 0.38) (Quinn 2010).
Shinto 2014 observed a significant difference for IADL measured
on the OARS-IADL subscale in favour for omega-3 PUFAs at
12 months (MD -3.50, 95% CI -4.30 to -2.70; 22 participants)
(Analysis 1.4). When missing data were considered in an LME
model adjusting for age and education at 12 months, the result
remained positive in favour for omega-3 PUFAs (P value < 0.01)
(Shinto 2014). Although the difference was significant, the out-
20

 come was only presented by one very small study. We downgraded
the quality of evidence to moderate because of a wide CI and a very
low number of participants (Summary of findings for the main
comparison).
Overall dementia severity (primary outcome)
A meta-analysis including measures of CDR-SOB from two stud-
ies revealed no significant difference between omega-3 PUFAs and
placebo at six months (MD -0.00, 95% CI -0.58 to 0.57; 542
participants; 2 studies; I2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.5) (Freund-Levi 2006;
Quinn 2010). We graded the quality of evidence across the studies
as high. The result was consistent in an LME model at 18 months
(P value = 0.68) (Quinn 2010).
Adverse effects (primary outcome)
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends an on-
treatment follow-up of at least 12 months to demonstrate long-
term safety (EMA 2014). Shinto 2014 and Quinn 2010 fulfilled
these requirements by implementing a treatment duration of 12
(Shinto 2014) and 18 (Quinn 2010) months. Freund-Levi 2006
did not report adverse events in detail.
Two of the three included studies described the intervention as well
tolerated and with only mild adverse events (Freund-Levi 2006;
Shinto 2014). In the study of Shinto 2014, adverse events such
as cold or influenza (omega-3 PUFAs: 2/13; placebo: 2/13), loose
stools (omega-3 PUFAs: 2/13; placebo: 3/13), dizziness (omega-
3 PUFAs: 1/13; placebo: 2/13) or falls (omega-3 PUFAs: 1/13:
placebo: 2/13) were similar between treatment and placebo group.
Serious adverse events (omega-3 PUFAs: 1/13 (cardiac arrest);
placebo: 1/13 (complications after a urinary tract infection)) were
not considered to be related to omega-3 PUFAs (Shinto 2014).
Freund-Levi 2006 did not report adverse events or serious adverse
events for each group. They described only the drop-out rate as
evenly distributed between the groups without unbundling the
reasons. Reasons for overall group drop-outs related to adverse
events were diarrhoea (nine drop-outs), dysphagia owing to the
size of the capsules (nine drop-outs) and new serious somatic dis-
ease (10 drop-outs). We obtained no further detailed information
regarding the distribution of these events to the groups by con-
tacting Dr. Freund-Levy by mail.
Quinn 2010 described adverse events at 18 months’ follow-up as
diarrhoea (omega-3 PUFAs: 7.6%; placebo: 6.1%), urinary tract
infections (omega-3 PUFAs: 9.7%; placebo: 7.3%), falls (omega-
3 PUFAs: 17.6%; placebo: 20.1%), dizziness (omega-3 PUFAs:
5.0%; placebo: 5.5%) and agitation (omega-3 PUFAs: 10.1%;
placebo: 7.3%). Almost every participant had an adverse event
when these outcomes were combined (omega-3 PUFAs: 89.9%;
placebo: 87.8%) (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.10; 402 participants;
1 study). The distribution of “any adverse events” was similar
between the treatment and the placebo group (Analysis 1.8).
Serious adverse events were infrequent and the differences between
the groups did not reach statistical significance (at the 5% level).
Participants in the omega-3 PUFAs group were more than twice
as likely to die (omega-3 PUFAs: 4.6%; placebo: 2.4%) or to de-
velop a deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus (omega-
3 PUFAs: 3.4%; placebo: 1.2%). Hospitalisation was a further
reported serious adverse event (omega-3 PUFAs: 28.2%; placebo:
26.2%). Considering all serious adverse events (death, hospitali-
sation, prolongation of hospitalisation and life-threatening inci-
dents) together, there was no difference between groups (RR 1.05,
95% CI 0.78 to 1.41; 402 participants; 1 study) (Analysis 1.9). We
graded the quality of evidence for serious adverse events as high as
we do not assume measurement errors for the included outcomes
as likely. We downgraded the quality of evidence for the outcome
’any adverse events’ for measurement uncertainties because the
outcome was an accumulation of partial subjective outcomes (i.e.
dizziness) and it was not clear how they were measured (Summary
of findings for the main comparison).
Compliance was not explicitly reported in any of the trials and
can be merely assumed by DHA levels presented in all three trials
showing significant increases in the interventions groups but not
in the placebo groups (Freund-Levi 2006; Quinn 2010; Shinto
2014).
Symptoms associated with dementia (secondary
outcome)
Mental health was depicted within the trials as depressive symp-
toms (MADRS) and neuropsychiatric disturbances (NPI). The
ADCS trial used a 12-item version of the NPI (Quinn 2010), and
the OmegAD trial used an extended version (Freund-Levi 2006).
The meta-analysis of both trials results revealed no difference at
six months (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.27; 543 participants;
2 studies; I2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.6). We judged the quality of evi-
dence across the studies as high (Summary of findings for the main
comparison). Considering missing data in an LME model, there
was no difference observed in the ADCS trial at 18 months (P
value = 0.11) (Quinn 2010).
Only Freund-Levi 2006 measured the severity of depressive
episodes using the MADRS. However, the means of both groups
were very low indicating no relevant depressive symptoms. There
was no significant difference between groups (MD -0.10, 95% CI
-0.74 to 0.54; 178 participants) (Analysis 1.7). The quality of ev-
idence was high (Summary of findings for the main comparison).
Quality of life (secondary outcome)
The ADCS trial assessed QoL using participant-reported and
proxy-reported by partners or carers QoL-AD. Dr. Quinn pro-
vided us with unpublished data from both. In this trial, there was
no difference when QoL was assessed by participants at six months
(MD -0.10, 95% CI -1.28 to 1.08; 332 participants) (Analysis
21
Omega-3 fatty acids for the treatment of dementia (Review)

 1.10) (Quinn 2010). We judged the quality of the evidence at
six months’ follow-up as high. There was a difference in favour
for placebo when QoL was assessed using informant-rated scores
at six months (MD -1.76, 95% CI -3.04 to -0.48; 331 partici-
pants) (Analysis 1.11). Both results remained similar at 18 months
(see Analysis 1.12 and Analysis 1.13). We downgraded the quality
of evidence for QoL rated by participants at 18 months because
of substantial group differences in the follow-up (Summary of
findings for the main comparison). We judged the rating of QoL
by the participants themselves as more trustworthy than a proxy
measurement. Therefore, we do not present the proxy measure of
QoL in Summary of findings for the main comparison.
Considering missing data in LME models, there was no difference
at 18 months, whether QoL was participant-rated (P value = 0.66)
or informant-rated (P value = 0.41) (Quinn 2010).
Effects on subgroups
The data were not sufficient to perform our pre-defined subgroup
analyses by dementia stage and nutrition status.
Quinn 2010 conducted several subgroup ITT analyses (LME) of
a more exploratory character (no adjustment for multiple testing
and reduced power to detect a difference). There were no differ-
ences for any outcomes in subgroups based on higher and lower
baseline MMSE scores (cut-off: 21 score points) and CDR (cut-
off: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 score points). Further subgroup analyses re-
ported in Quinn 2010 and Freund-Levi 2006 were not pre-de-
fined in our protocol, therefore we have not included them in our
review.
Sensitivity analysis
We assumed that the means and SDs of the outcomes for missing
participants in both groups corresponded with the values for ob-
served cases in the control group. We imputed missing six-month
values for ADAS-Cog in all three trials (Freund-Levi 2006; Quinn
2010; Shinto 2014). The meta-analysis based on this assumption
showed no difference between the groups on ADAS-Cog (SMD -
0.02, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.13; 632 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%)
(Analysis 1.14) (see Figure 5).

We also combined MMSE and ADAS-Cog results at endpoint
from all three trials, irrespective of study duration. In these analy-
ses, there was no significant difference between groups for MMSE
(MD 0.55, 95% CI -0.31 to 1.40; 464 participants; 3 studies; I2 =
0%) (Analysis 1.15) or ADAS-Cog (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.20 to
0.15; 504 participants; 3 studies; I2 = 0%) (Analysis 1.16). Figure

Summary of main results
The review included three studies involving 632 participants with
AD.
There was no convincing benefit of omega-3 PUFAs for our pre-
defined primary outcomes of cognition, function or dementia
severity, or for any other outcomes within the scope of this re-
view, regardless of the dose of omega-3 PUFAs or the duration of
intake. There was a numerical advantage of omega-3 PUFAs for
cognition but even the upper boundaries of the related CIs were
nearly always below published estimates of an MCID. Our results
on the safety and adverse effects of dietary omega-3 PUFAs were
consistent with previous findings and assumptions (EFSA 2012;
Eritsland 2000; FAO 2010; Sydenham 2012). There were adverse
events in the study population, but these occurred equally in the
treatment and the placebo groups.
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
All trials assessed relevant endpoints to evaluate therapeutic effi-
cacy in people with dementia. The larger studies addressed cog-
nitive function, ADL and global severity of dementia together
(Freund-Levi 2006; Quinn 2010), as recommended by an expert
group of the European Medicines Agency (EMA 2014). However,
the pilot study of Shinto 2014 addressed a surrogate parameter
as the primary endpoint and the study was not designed to test
efficacy in the secondary endpoints relevant for this review.
All trials included participants with diagnoses of AD of mild to
moderate severity and tested an appropriate dose (according to
EFSA 2010; EFSA 2012). We found no trial investigating omega-
3 PUFAs in other dosages, or type or stage of dementia. Therefore,
we cannot draw conclusions on people with VaD, DLB, PDD or
FTD, or more severe forms of AD. Mean values of nutritional
parameters presented in the studies indicated no malnutrition or
lack of DHA at baseline and none of the trials investigated relevant
subgroups. Therefore, we cannot rule out that trial participants
with poorer baseline nutritional status may benefit more from the
intervention.
Quality of the evidence
All three studies were RCTs. By using the GRADE approach, we
rated the overall quality of evidence for most outcomes as high.
By the GRADE definition, this means, “we are very confident
that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect”
(Schünemann 2013). However, Freund-Levi 2006 did not report
if blinding was maintained long enough to blind the outcome as-
sessor but we assumed that this was a reporting issue and judged
that the possible impact on the pooled outcomes was small when
combined with the larger ADCS trial (Quinn 2010). All uncer-
tainties regarding data that arose during the review process were
resolved when we contacted the study authors.
Potential biases in the review process
More than one-quarter of all randomised participants discontin-
ued study participation. To date, there is no optimal method to
address missing data in trials on dementia. Due to the progressive
course of the disease, both ITT based on the LOCF data and per-
protocol analysis based on data assessed on completers of the tri-
als are questionable, if not inappropriate, analysis methods (EMA
2014). We addressed this potential bias in a six-month sensitivity
analysis, imputing missing data on the assumption of similarity
to the data of the control group and the results remained similar.
However, it is conceivable that this assumption is violated by the
23

 possibility that participants who discontinued the studies could
have had even worse results than the control groups.
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
This review is in line with several other Cochrane systematic re-
views investigating the effect of omega-3 PUFAs in the prevention
or therapy of neurological diseases (Dennis 2013; Irving 2006;
Montgomery 2008, Sydenham 2012), where there was no evi-
dence from RCTs for the effectiveness of omega-3 PUFAs. This ap-
plies also for a range of other diseases affecting people of advanced
age (Campbell 2013; Hartweg 2008; Hooper 2004; Lawrenson
2015).

Implications for practice
We found no convincing evidence for efficacy of omega-3 polyun-
saturated fatty acids (omega-3 PUFA) supplements in the treat-
ment of mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). This result
was based on high quality evidence and was consistent across all
of the outcomes relevant for people with AD. It is possible that
omega-3 PUFAs improve instrumental activities of daily living,
such as more complex activities (i.e. shopping), when taken for
a longer period of time, but this has to be confirmed in further
trials. Adverse effects of omega-3 PUFAs seem to be uncommon,
but based on the evidence synthesised in this review, we cannot
make a definite statement on the tolerability of omega-3 PUFA
supplements.
The effects on other populations of people with dementia remain
unclear.
Implications for research
Based on consistent results from high quality evidence, we do not
believe any further studies investigating the same treatment regi-
men in people with mild to moderate AD would yield any other
results related to cognition and basic function. However, it re-
mains unclear if people with other types of dementia or differing
levels of severity of dementia would benefit from omega-3 PUFAs.
This applies in particular for people with a docosahexaenoic acid
(DHA) deficit. Therefore, future trials should provide pre-speci-
fied subgroup analyses for people with malnutrition or low DHA
levels.
Based on current discussions (EMA 2014; Vellas 2008), it may
prove favourable to assess cognition with outcome measures more
sensitive to change versus the regular scales (e.g. Harrison 2007).
It can also be hypothesised that changes in instrumental activities
of daily living (i.e. doing finances) are more likely to be detected
in early stages of dementia. Therefore, future trials should also
consider using measures for instrumental activities of daily living.
More emphasis should be placed on statistical issues because the
proportion of missing data in trials investigating dementia can
be high. Simple methods such as last observation carried for-
ward are seemingly attractive for longitudinal designs, but often
cause bias due to several shortcomings. Possibly the most obvious
and severe being that it ignores the progressive course of demen-
tia disease (Molnar 2008). Mixed models for repeated measures
and slope-based analyses can also overestimate the effect (EMA
2014). Both models do not account for the possibility of a less
favourable course for people discontinuing the study. In a Euro-
pean Medicines Agency (EMA) discussion paper, several alterna-
tive choices of analyses and sensitivity analyses were suggested to
accompany the primary analysis (EMA 2014). Such additional
calculations can be useful to interpret the data, provided that the
assumptions and methods for imputed data are described and the
assumed effect and variability measures are presented. Following
the suggestion of Molnar 2009, it might further support inter-
pretability and decision making, if minimal clinically important
differences of outcome measures are determined as a complemen-
tary part in randomised controlled trials investigating omega-3
PUFAs for dementia. It can be reasonably assumed that for many
people affected by cognitive decline, the trade-off between effec-
tiveness, adverse effects and costs of nutritional supplements dif-
fers from that of drugs prescribed for dementia.
