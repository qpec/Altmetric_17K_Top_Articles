Abstract
Background: Surfactant Protein-A (SP-A) is a major protein component of surfactant and plays a role in surfactant-
related functions and innate immunity. Human SP-A consists of two functional genes, SFTPA1 and SFTPA2,
encoding SP-A1 and SP-A2 proteins, respectively and each is identified with numerous genetic variants. These
differentially enhance bacterial phagocytosis, with SP-A2 variants being more effective than SP-A1.
Methods: Lung functions of humanized transgenic (hTG) mice that carry different SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants or both
variants SP-A1/SP-A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex), as well as SP-A knockout (KO), were studied. The animals were connected to
a flexiVent system to obtain forced oscillation technique (FOT) measurements and the data were analyzed using
various models. Lung function was assessed after infection (baseline) and following inhaled methacholine
concentrations (0–50 mg/mL).
Results: Here, we investigated the role of SP-A variants on airway function after Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp)
infection (baseline) and following inhaled methacholine. We found that: 1) in the absence of methacholine no
significant differences were observed between SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants and/or SP-A knockout (KO) except for
sex differences in most of the parameters studied. 2) In response to methacholine, i) sex differences were
observed that were reverse of those observed in the absence of methacholine; ii) SP-A2 (1A3) gene variant in
males exhibited increased total and central airway resistance (Rrs and Rn) versus all other variants; iii) In females,
SP-A2 (1A3) and SP-A1 (6A2) variants had similar increases in total and central airway resistance (Rrs and Rn)
versus all other variants; iv) Allele-specific differences were observed, a) with SP-A2 (1A3) exhibiting significantly
higher lung functions versus SP-A2 (1A0) in both sexes, except for Crs, and b) SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4) had more diverse
changes in lung function in both sexes.

Conclusion: We conclude that, in response to infection and methacholine, SP-A variants differentially affect lung
function and exhibit sex-specific differences consistent with previously reported findings of functional differences
of SP-A variants. Thus, the observed changes in respiratory function mechanics provide insight into the role and
importance of genetic variation of innate immune molecules, such as SP-A, on mechanical consequences of lung
function after infection and inhaled substances.

Background
The initial defense against inhaled pathogens, allergens,
air pollutants, and other harmful substances in the envir-
onment is performed by cells and molecules present in
the lung. For example, the alveolar macrophage (AM) is
the principal effector cell for innate immunity against
inhaled substances and thus protects the lung from these
potential hazards. The distal airways and alveoli consist of
epithelial type I and type II cells. The type II cells are the
source of pulmonary surfactant, a lipoprotein complex,
which lines the entire surface of the alveoli, and its com-
ponents play a key role in innate immunity. Surfactant
protein A (SP-A) is the major protein component of pul-
monary surfactant and regulates host lung defense [1].
SP-A is a major surfactant host defense component
and belongs to the group of mammalian lectins and col-
lectins which are involved in innate immunity [2, 3]. SP-
A is involved in multiple AM-mediated host defense
functions such as the stimulation of chemotaxis of mac-
rophages [4], enhancement of phagocytosis of bacteria
by macrophages [5–8], proliferation of immune cells [9,
10], and linkage of innate and adaptive immunity [11].
We and others have shown that in the absence of SP-A
the susceptibility to pneumonia and other types of lung
injury is increased [12–16]. Human SP-A consists of two
functional genes, SFTPA1 and SFTPA2,encoding SP-A1
and SP-A2 proteins, respectively, and each has been
identified with a number of variants [17, 18]. SP-A gene
variants are classified based on their nucleotide differ-
ences within the coding sequences [17–19].
The SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants have been identified
with both qualitative (i.e., functional, biochemical and/or
structural) differences and quantitative (regulatory) dif-
ferences. The qualitative differences include differences
in their ability to stimulate phagocytosis [7, 8], bind car-
bohydrates [20], inhibit surfactant secretion [21], and
stimulate production of TNF-α by macrophage-like
THP-1 cells [22–24], as well as differences in their ag-
gregation and oligomerization properties [21, 25, 26].
Quantitative differences include differences between the
SP-A1 and SP-A2 and/or variants in basal mRNA levels
and in response to dexamethasone [27–30], and differ-
ences in SP-A protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) fluids from different individuals [31]. It has been
observed that these variants differ in their ability to
affect the biophysical function of surfactant, with SP-A1
exhibiting a higher efficiency in pulmonary surfactant
reorganization and thus playing an important role in
lung function [32]. Differences in the proteomic expres-
sion profile of AM and the AM actin cytoskeleton have
been observed between SP-A1 (6A2) and SP-A2 (1A0)
variants [33, 34].
Previously, we have shown that SP-A1 and SP-A2 vari-
ants differentially enhance bacterial association with the
AM, with SP-A2 being more effective than SP-A1 [7, 8].
However, this activity is differentially compromised in
response to ozone-induced oxidation [35]. Together
these indicate that functional differences exist between
SP-A1 and SP-A2 in-vivo and that the lung microenvir-
onment differentially affects the function of SP-A vari-
ants.
Furthermore,
Klebsiella
pneumoniae
infection
resulted in sex-dependent survival, with females exhibit-
ing higher survival compared to males, and the reverse
after oxidative stress [36], with females exhibiting lower
survival compared to males. Sex hormones were impli-
cated in the differential survival [37].
SP-A is known to play a role in lung surfactant
homeostasis,
host
defense,
and
airway
function
in
response to bacterial infection [1, 38–41]. Mice lacking
SP-A exhibit significantly increased airway hyperrespon-
siveness to bacterial infection compared to wild type
[39], indicating that SP-A may contribute to airway/lung
mechanics. Thus, we speculated that SP-A influences
lung mechanics, by various mechanisms where SP-A has
been shown to play a role. These may include i) regula-
tion of gene expression in lung fibroblast [42], which
could influence the lung interstitium and its properties,
ii) ability to regulate alveolar macrophage gene expres-
sion [22, 24], which could alter the level of inflammation
in the lung and this in turn may contribute to a change
in its mechanical characteristics, and iii) effect on surfac-
tant structure and/or function that could also have an
impact on lung mechanics [25, 32, 43, 44]. Based on the
available literature and specifically the differential impact
of SP-A variants on surfactant characteristics [32],
inflammatory processes [22, 24], and infection [7, 8, 16,
Thorenoor et al. Respiratory Research  (2018) 19:23 
Page 2 of 14
 36, 45], we hypothesized that the SP-A genetic variants
differentially affect lung mechanics.
In the present study, we investigated the role of two
SP-A1 and two SP-A2 variants that are frequently
observed in the general population [17] on lung function
mechanics after K.pneumoniae infection in the presence
or absence of methacholine challenge. For this purpose,
we utilized the forced oscillation technique (FOT) to
measure mechanical properties of lungs. FOT is a
powerful, integrative and translational approach to study
the physiological changes in the lung and provides mea-
surements of respiratory system mechanics through the
analysis of pressure and volume signals. This tool is also
used to assess airway responsiveness to inhaled sub-
stances (methacholine) and other pathological condi-
tions [46]. The data obtained from FOT measurements
were analyzed with flexiware software (SCIREQ) using
the
single-compartment
model,
the
constant
phase
model, as well as the Salazar-Knowles equation.
The findings indicated that the SP-A1 and SP-A2 vari-
ants play a crucial role in the differential outcome of
airway function in males and females. SP-A variants
exhibited significant sex-specific and gene-specific differ-
ences in airway function mechanics in response to infec-
tion and methacholine challenge. From our studies, we
speculate that the genetic makeup of innate immune
molecules such as SP-A1 and SP-A2 can differentially
affect the mechanics of lung function in males and
females under different conditions.
Methods
Animals
All mice used in the present study were 12 weeks of age.
We used humanized transgenic (hTG) that carried SP-
A1 (6A2, 6A4), SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3), or both variants SP-
A1/SP-A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex), as well as SP-A knockout
(KO). hTG mice were generated on the C57BL6/J SP-A
(KO) background [47]. The animals were raised and
maintained under approved housing conditions in a
pathogen-free environment, at the Penn State College of
Medicine animal facility. Both males and synchronized
females (with regard to the estrous cycle) were used in
this study. For synchronization, dirty bedding from male
cages was placed in group-housed female cages 7 days
prior to infection to stimulate estrus in females. The
Penn State Hershey Medical Center Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee (IACUC) approved all proce-
dures involving animals.
Preparation of bacteria
K. pneumoniae bacteria (ATCC 43816) were obtained
from American Tissue Culture Collection (Rockville,
MD) and prepared as described previously [16]. In brief,
bacteria were grown at 37 °C for 18 h in Tryptic soy
broth (TSB) media to reach stationary phase. The over-
night bacterial culture was diluted until the OD660 was
equal to 0.4, and 200 μl were used to inoculate a sub-
culture in 50 ml of fresh TSB for 3 h to reach the mid-
log phase of growth. The growth was stopped by keeping
the subculture on the ice and serially diluted in PBS to
obtain ~ 9 × 103 CFU/ml. Fifty μl of a bacterial suspen-
sion containing ~ 450 CFU was used to infect mice.
CFU per ml values were estimated based on the stand-
ard curve obtained at OD660 of the bacterial suspension.
Infection of mice with K. pneumoniae
Infection was performed as described previously [16].
Briefly, humanized transgenic (hTG) mice, SP-A1 (6A2,
6A4), SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3), SP-A1/SP-A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex)
and SP-A (KO) male and female mice (n = 4 for per
group) were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine and
xylazine and infected with K. pneumoniae (~ 450 CFU/
mouse) in 50 μl of PBS intratracheally for 18 h.
Respiratory mechanics
Parameters of lung function were measured using the
forced oscillation technique (FOT) and a computer-
controlled flexiVent FX ventilator (SCIREQ, Montreal,
Canada) as previously described by McGovern [46].
Briefly, after 18 h of infection, the mice were anesthe-
tized with a mixture of ketamine and xylazine. The tra-
chea was cannulated and mice were connected to the
flexiVent via cannula. Oxygen-containing 2% Isoflurane
was used to ventilate the lungs at a rate of 150 breaths
per minute (BPM) with a positive end-expiratory pres-
sure (PEEP) of 3cmH2O. To block spontaneous respira-
tory movement, a non-polarizing paralytic (vecuronium
bromide) was used. Manual pressure-volume loop (PV)
and deep inflation scans were performed to obtain base-
line parameters, followed by methacholine response.
Methacholine (acetyl-β-methylcholine chloride, Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, MO) doses were prepared prior to the
start of the experiment and administered using the flexi-
Vent Aeroneb fine particle nebulizer in DPBS for 10 s
per dose with concentration ranging from 0 to 50 (0,
1.56, 3.13, 6.25, 12.5, 25 and 50) mg/mL. The script used
for the inhaled dose response included two Deep
Inflation scans followed by 12 repeats of alternating
SnapShot (sinusoidal – single frequency forced oscilla-
tion waveform) and Primewave (broadband – multi-
frequency forced oscillation waveform) scans were per-
formed for baseline (18 h after infection) measurement
and for each dose methacholine challenge.
Data
were
analyzed
with
flexiware
software
(SCIREQ) using the single-compartment model, the
constant phase model, and the Salazar-Knowles equa-
tion. The single-compartment model was used to

 elastance
(Ers).
The
constant
phase
model allows
measuring the partitioning of the responses within
the lungs [48]. The constant phase model fits into the
equation: Zrs(f) = RN + j x 2πf x Iaw + (G - j x H)/
(2πf)α, where Z is input impedance and expresses the
combined effects of resistance, compliance, and iner-
tance as a function of frequency (f); RN is Newtonian
“airway” resistance: Iaw is airway inertance and is
dominated by the mass of gas in the central airways,
and impedance of tissue is accounted for by G (tissue
damping) and H (tissue elastance). G is closely related
to peripheral airway and tissue resistance and reflects
energy dissipation in the lung tissues, j is an imagin-
ary number, H is tissue elastance and reflects energy
storage in the tissues, α is 2/π tan− 1 (H/G), and f is
respiratory frequency [48]. The PV loop was fit into
the Salazar-Knowles equation to obtain static compli-
ance (Cst), an estimate of the inspiratory capacity (A)
and
the
shape
constant
k
[49].
Data
were
then
exported to Excel for further analysis.
Statistical analysis
The analysis of respiratory mechanics parameters and
expiratory flow obtained under baseline condition (infec-
tion) and methacholine challenge was performed by
one-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
followed by Bonferroni multiple comparisons correction
for each experimental group with p value < 0.05 consid-
ered to be significant (GraphPad Prism version5; Graph-
Pad Software, San Diego, USA). Data are expressed as
mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Results
hTG mice, SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4), SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3), SP-A1/
SP-A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex), and SP-A knockout (KO) male
and female mice were infected with K.pneumoniae. After
18 h of infection airway lung function measurements
were performed in the absence or presence of metha-
choline challenge as described in methods.
Respiratory mechanics after infection (baseline)
Sex differences between SP-A1, SP-A2, KO, and SP-A1/SP-A2
(6A2/1A0, co-ex)
The females of all mouse lines studied showed a signifi-
cant increase in total resistance (Rrs) compared to males
(Fig. 1a). In contrast, all females showed a decrease in
compliance (Crs) compared to all males except for the SP-
A2 (1A0), where no significant differences between males
and females were observed (Fig. 1b). For elastance (Ers)
and tissue damping (G), female values were significantly
greater than males for all except the SP-A2 (1A0) mice
(Fig. 1c, e). In terms of tissue elastance (H), all females
showed a significant increase compared to males except
for the SP-A2 (1A0) that showed no sex difference and
KO females showed a significant decrease compared to
males (Fig. 1f). With respect to Newtonian airway resist-
ance (Rn), the SP-A2 (1A0) and co-ex females showed an
increase compared to males but none of the other mouse
lines exhibited any significant difference (Fig. 1d).
Differences among mice that lack SP-A (KO) or mice that
carry a different SP-A variant (SP-A1 or SP-A2)
Differences in respiratory properties among the mouse
lines at the time of assessment (i.e. 18 h after infection)
are as follows. No significant differences were observed in
pressure-volume (PV) curves among the variants in either
males (Fig. 2) or females (Fig. 3) after infection. Although
SP-A1 (6A2), and co-ex males and females (Figs. 2a and
3a), and SP-A2 (1A0) females (Fig. 3a) exhibited a non-
significant upward shift in PV curves, this did not result in
any significant difference in any of the functions studied
compared to other variants or KO (Figs. 2b, c & 3b, c).
Mice that carry a single gene variant SP-A1, SP-A2, or mice
that lack SP-A versus mice that carry both SP-A1/SP-A2
variants, i.e. co-ex
Mice carrying SP-A1/SP-A2 variants (co-ex) in males,
exhibited similar inspiratory capacity (parameter A) and
static compliance (Cst) with SP-A2 (1A3) and SP-A1 (6A2),
whereas the other variants exhibited a significant decrease
in inspiratory capacity and static compliance compared to
co-ex (Fig. 2b, c). Furthermore, the male co-ex showed sig-
nificant increases in inspiratory capacity and compliance
compared to KO males (Fig. 2b, c), but no other differences
were found with KO in the parameters studied. In contrast,
in females, there was no significant difference in inspiratory
capacity and static compliance between mice carrying both
SP-A1/SP-A2 gene variants, mice that carry a single gene
variant, and KO mice (Fig. 3b, c).
Moreover,
in
the
dimensionless
and
volume-
independent shape constant k that describes the curva-
ture of the curves (Figs. 2d & 3d) and in the area be-
tween the inflation and deflation limb of the PV curves
(Figs. 2e & 3e), no change was observed in either males
or females. This indicates no change in the intrinsic elas-
tic properties of the respiratory system after infection
among the males and females experimental groups.
In general, the data in section I indicate that in re-
sponse to infection there are sex differences in most (if
not all) parameters studied, with females exhibiting
higher values (except in Crs).

 respiratory resistance (Rrs), elastance (Ers), Newtonian
airway resistance (Rn), tissue damping (G), tissue elas-
tance (H), and compliance (Crs). In the SP-A2 (1A0,
1a3) groups, all males compared to females showed a
significant increase in Rrs, Ers, Rn, G, and H respiratory
functions (Fig. 4a, c, d, e, f) and a significant decrease in
Crs (Fig. 4b). However, in the case of SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4)
groups, a more diverse response was observed. Both
6A2 and 6A4 males showed an increase in Rrs and Rn
(Fig. 4a, d). The 6A2 males showed an increase in Crs
(Fig. 4b), and a decrease in H (Fig. 4f), and the 6A4
showed no sex difference in either parameter. The 6A2
and 6A4 males showed a decrease and increase in Ers,
respectively (Fig. 4c). The 6A4 males also showed an in-
crease in tissue damping (G) but no change was ob-
served in 6A2 males (Fig. 4e). In KO, sex differences
were observed with males exhibiting higher Ers, Rn, and
H (Fig. 4c, d, f) and lower (Crs) values (Fig. 4b). In mice
carrying both SP-A1/SP-A2 variants (co-ex), males had
higher Crs (Fig. 4b) and lower Ers, and H (Fig. 4c, f)
values, with no sex changes observed in Rrs, Rn, and G
(Fig. 4a, d, e).
Gene-specific variant differences
SP-A2: Challenge with methacholine (50 mg/mL) re-
sulted in SP-A2 gene-specific variant differences be-
tween 1A0 and 1A3. In both male and female mice, there
was a decrease in Rrs, Ers, Rn, G, and H functions and
an increase in Crs function in 1A0 compared to 1A3
(Figs. 5a-f & 6a-f).
SP-A1:
The
methacholine
(50
mg/mL)
challenge
resulted in more diverse changes between the SP-A1
gene-specific variants in males and females. For example,
the 6A4 mice versus the 6A2 mice showed a significant
decrease in both males and females in Rrs and Rn (Figs. 5a,
d & 6a, d), and although the 6A4 had a significant decrease

panel a, compliance (Crs) panel b, elastance (Ers) panel c, and constant phase model parameters airway resistance (Rn), tissue damping (g), and
tissue elastance (h), (panels d, e, f) were measured in SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4), SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3), SP-A1/SP-A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex), and SP-A (KO) male and
female mice after 18 h of infection. Data are expressed as mean ± SD (4 replicates per group). *p < 0.05

 in Crs in males, no significant changes were observed in
females (Figs. 5b & 6b). In some of the other functions
such as, Ers and G, the 6A4 males compared to 6A2 males
showed a significant increase but the 6A4females com-
pared to 6A2 females had the opposite result showing a
significant decrease in these parameters (Figs. 5c, e & 6c,
e); both 6A4 males and females showed a significant in-
crease in H compared to 6A2 male and females respect-
ively (Figs. 5f & 6f). Thus, although significant differences
between variants of SP-A1 or SP-A2 were observed, the
SP-A2 variants did not show any sex differences in the
functions studied, whereas SP-A1 variants did show sex
differences.
Differences between SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants
The SP-A2 (1A0) males and females exhibited signifi-
cant functional changes compared to SP-A1 (6A2) vari-
ants in response to methacholine (50 mg/mL). The 1A0
showed a significant decrease (vs 6A2) for both males
and females in Rrs and Rn (Figs. 5a & 6d), and a
significant decrease in Crs in males, but a significant in-
crease in females (Figs. 5b & 6b). In some of the func-
tions such as Ers, G, and H, the 1A0 males showed a
significant increase relative to 6A2 males but the females
had the opposite result showing a significant decrease in
these parameters compared to 6A2 (Figs. 5c, e, f & 6c, e,
f).
However, in males no significant differences were
observed between 1A0 and 6A4 in any of the parame-
ters studied (Fig. 5a-f), but in 1A0 females a signifi-
cant decrease was observed in Rrs, Ers, G, and H
(Fig. 6a, c, e, f) and a significant increase in Crs
function (Fig. 6b) compared to 6A4. There was no
significant change in Rn values between 1A0 and 6A4
females (Fig. 6d).
The SP-A2 (1A3) males and females exhibited sig-
nificant functional changes compared to SP-A1 (6A2)
variants in response to methacholine (50 mg/mL). In
males, the 1A3 showed a significant increase in Rrs,
Ers, G, and H (Fig. 5a, c, e, f) compared to 6A2.

 However, the 1A3 females had opposite results in Ers
and
H
function
showing
a
significant
decrease
(Fig. 6c, f) and with no significant changes in Rrs
and G compared to 6A2 females (Fig. 6a, e). More-
over, in Crs the 1A3 male had a significant decrease,
and the 1A3 females showed a significant increase
(Figs. 5b & 6b). There was no significant change in
Rn values between 1A3 and 6A2 in either males or
females (Figs. 5d & 6d).
The SP-A2 (1A3) also had significant changes in
response to methacholine (50 mg/mL) compared to
SP-A1 (6A4) variants for both males and females. For
example, the 1A3 when compared to 6A4 showed a
significant increase in both males and females in Rrs,
Rn, and G (Figs. 5a, d, e & 6a, d, e), and a significant
increase and decrease for H in males and females,
respectively (Figs. 5f & 6f). In some other functions
such as Crs and Ers, the 1A3 males showed a signifi-
cant decrease and increase, respectively (Fig. 5b, c),
with no significant changes being observed in 1A3 fe-
males compared to 6A4 (Fig. 6b, c).
Differences with SP-A1/SP-A2 (co-ex) or KO and SP-A1 or
SP-A2 variants
i. The SP-A1/SP-A2 (co-ex) exhibited significant
differences compared to different SP-A variants in
several parameters in both males and females, as
shown in Figs. 5 and 6. Of interest, the co-ex was
similar to 1A0 males (Rn, Fig. 5d) and 1A0 females
(Rrs, Crs, Rn, and G, Fig. 6a, b, d, e), as well as 6A4
females (Rn, Fig. 6d).
ii. The KO exhibited significant differences compared to
SP-A variants as did the co-ex in several parameters
for both males and females, as shown in Figs. 5 and 6.
Of interest, the KO was similar to 1A0 males (Rn, and
H, Fig. 5d, f) and 1A0 females (Rrs, Fig. 6a), the 6A2
males (Ers, and G, Fig. 5c, e), the 6A4 males (H,

as well as the co-ex females (Rrs, Fig. 6a).
The data in section II in response to infection and
methacholine challenge indicate that a) the observed sex
differences are reversed from those observed in response
to infection alone, and b) SP-A variants exhibit a differ-
ential impact on lung function parameters. Together
these provide insight on the varied contribution of SP-A
variants to lung function.
Discussion
Surfactant protein A (SP-A) plays an important role in
lung innate immunity. The SP-A variants differ in their
ability to enhance association of bacteria with the alveo-
lar macrophage (AM), and SP-A2 variants are more
effective than SP-A1 [3, 7, 8]. The lung microenviron-
ment also affects the functional activity of a given vari-
ant. For example, an increase in reactive oxygen species
(ROS) differentially oxidizes the SP-A variants which
consequently has an effect on their function. Oxidative
stress is shown to affect SP-A2 gene-specific variants
activity more than that of the SP-A1 variants [35]. In the
current study, we compared the effect of SP-A1 (6A2,
6A4) and SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3) gene-specific variants on
respiratory functions after Klebsiella pneumoniae infec-
tion and airway responses to methacholine challenge.
The goal was to gain insight into the differences result-
ing from the presence or absence of SP-A1 and SP-A2
variants on lung function as well as elucidating the role
of these variants in airway hyperreactivity. We used
the forced oscillation technique (FOT) to measure

 mechanical properties of lungs, and measured total re-
spiratory resistance (Rrs), elastance (Ers), Newtonian
“airway” resistance (Rn), tissue damping (G- energy dis-
sipation in the alveoli), and tissue elastance (H- energy
conservation in the alveoli).
Sex differences in response to infection (baseline) and in
response to methacholine
Sex is one of the factors that differentially modulates
lung function. Previously, we have shown that sex
differences exist in the clinical course of mice with
pneumonia combined with an oxidative stress [16, 36,
45]. Sex hormones have been shown to influence lung
function, the course of the disease, and the response to
environmental agents in animal models [37, 50]. In the
present study, all SP-A variants exhibited sex differences
in lung functions in response to infection at baseline and
in response to methacholine in all of the parameters
studied. The infection itself affected the respiratory me-
chanics, with females exhibiting a significant increase in

Ers, Rn, G, and H (panel a, b, c, d, e, and f), were measured in male SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4), SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3), SP-A1/SP-A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex), and SP-A
(KO) mice after a 50 mg/mL of methacholine challenge (bar graph). Inset: depicts the effect of dose response with increasing concentration of

 most FOT parameters compared to males. Of interest,
this pattern was reversed after methacholine challenge
with males showing significant increases in nearly all
FOT parameters. The increase in Rrs indicates that in-
fection may cause an increase in resistive properties in
females, but after methacholine challenge, females ex-
hibit the opposite result. Rrs is commonly interpreted as
respiratory system resistance (surrogate of airway resist-
ance). Our data indicated that the respiratory system re-
sistance was altered in our experimental condition.
Thus, Rrs in addition to the respiratory system resist-
ance is also coupled to the resistive properties of lung
tissue (Figs. 1a, & 4a), which confirms previous findings
[51]. Rn, provides a good measure of the overall resist-
ance of the conducting airways that are dominant in
proximal airways [52]. Rn was not altered after infection,
except for in 1A0 and co-ex mice, indicating that loss of
lung function after infection is likely restricted to the
periphery, and may be due to small airway closure or al-
veolar collapse. However, Rn was altered following

SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4), SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3), SP-A1/SP-A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex), and SP-A (KO) mice, Rrs, Crs, Ers, Rn, G, and H (panel a, b, c, d, e and f)were mea-
sured after a 50 mg/mL of methacholine challenge (bar graph). Inset: depicts the effect of dose response with increasing concentrations of

 methacholine challenge, with males exhibiting a signifi-
cant increase compared to females in all mouse lines
studied except for co-ex (Figs. 1d, & 4d). This indicates
that the airway is narrowing as methacholine aerosol
reaches the airway smooth muscle and causing it to con-
tract. It has been suggested that bronchoconstriction re-
sults in complete closure of air space in the lung [53]
and removal of a contractile agonist, such as methacho-
line from the circulation does not relax the airway
smooth muscle fully to its initial level unless physically
extended [54]. Furthermore, it has been observed that
the functional residual capacity in mice increases in a
dose-dependent manner with methacholine usage [55],
indicative of gas trapping in the lung and that the struc-
tures that are closing are airways rather than alveoli [54].
Parameters G and H, represent energy dissipation, and
energy conservation in alveoli, respectively. Parameter
G, which is closely related to changes in airway resist-
ance [56, 57], is due to the parenchymal distortion that
occurs when the airways constrict. The closure of the
airways causes H to increase, due to the reduced lung
space in the open regions and this increases the overall
elastance [54]. Females showed a significant increase in
G and H after infection in all variants except 1A0. But
the females including 1A0 compared to males had
opposite results after methacholine challenge showing a
significant decrease in both G and H (Figs. 1E, F & 4E,
F). These data indicate that for all mouse lines studied
there is a clear sex difference in response to various irri-
tants (infection, methacholine), with the exception of
1A0 that showed either no sex difference or sex differ-
ence depending on the challenge or combination of
challenges. We speculate that, the observed no sex dif-
ference in G and H parameters for 1A0 after infection is
due to the incomplete closure of the airways. Whereas,
the observed sex differences in Rn for 1A0 after infec-
tion, were partly due to the narrowing of the airways
and perhaps to other unidentified factors. The G can
increase due to the heterogeneity in airflow throughout
the lung [57, 58] and bronchoconstriction is inherently a
heterogeneous phenomenon
[59].
Thus a
similarity
exists between G and Rn after methacholine challenge in
SP-A variants. The H can increase due to an increase in
intrinsic tissue properties, which could result from the
distortion of the parenchyma produced as the airways
narrow [56], and increase through the development of
regional heterogeneities throughout the lung [56, 57,
60]. The H will be maximal when airway narrowing is
maximal and when Rn is maximal, as observed after
methacholine challenge; the heterogeneity in the nar-
rowing of airways always seems to develop commensur-
ately with the degree of mean airway constriction [61].
Compliance (Crs) measures the ease with which lung
can be inflated, a drop in compliance value indicates
increased stiffness in the lungs. The females exhibited a
significant decrease in compliance for all groups except
the 1A0 variant, but following methacholine challenge
had a significant increase in Crs in SP-A2 (including
1A0variant) (Figs. 1b, & 4b). Data from our previous
studies indicated that females are less susceptible to
pneumonia and have a better outcome, but are more
sensitive to an additional environmental stress (ozone)
as shown by a greater reduction in their survival com-
pared to males [45]. Moreover, the bacterial infection
caused a significant increase in elastance (Ers) in females
except for 1A0 variant. Ers measures the elastic rigidity
of the lung in the distal airways. The higher respiratory
elastance is significantly altered after methacholine chal-
lenge with males exhibiting increased elastance including
1A0 variant (Figs. 1c, & 4c). The observed lung function
differences further confirm that sex differences exist and
that the lung microenvironment, as well as, the genetics
of innate immunity of an individual, may play an import-
ant role in these differences. For example, the 1A0 in the
absence
of
methacholine
challenge
exhibited
significantly different values in parameter H, G, Crs, and
Ers, from all other mouse lines. Even though we have
shown previously that the SP-A variants differ in their
bacterial phagocytic activity, with SP-A2 variants exhibit-
ing better phagocytic activity than SP-A1, a higher
reduction in the phagocytic activity after ozone exposure
compared to non-ozone exposed variants was observed
in SP-A2 [36].
Even though, both males and females have similar
respiratory requirements, sexual dimorphism in lung
function and lung disease has been observed [62]. The
sexual dimorphism in the severity of pneumonia [63, 64]
and other lung disorders have been observed in different
studies [65]. From previous observations and the present
lung function data, we postulate that SP-A1 and SP-A2
variants play an important role in the observed sex dif-
ferences in airway hyperreactivity in response to infec-
tion and methacholine challenge and thus sex hormones
may differentially affect lung function.
Genotype differences in response to infection and in
response to methacholine
Although, the SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants exhibited major
sex difference in most of the lung function studied after
infection or in response to methacholine, the SP-A1/SP-
A2 (6A2/1A0, co-ex) showed sex differences with Rrs,
Rn, G, H, and Ers being increased and Crs being
decreased in females compared to males after infection
(Fig. 1), but this pattern changed after methacholine
challenge (Fig. 4). Moreover, co-ex exhibited significantly
decreased lung function compared to mice with a single
gene product i.e. 1A0, 1A3, 6A2, and 6A4, in both males
and females (Figs. 5, & 6). It has been previously
Thorenoor et al. Respiratory Research  (2018) 19:23 
Page 11 of 14
 observed that the phagocytic activity of the 1A0 variant
is higher than the 6A2 and the 6A2/1A0 variants [7]. The
structural stability of the SP-A1 (6A2) is lower than that
of the SP-A2 [25]. Whether the decrease in function in
co-ex compared to single gene variants is due to the
lower structure stability of 6A2 remains to be deter-
mined. Moreover, in humans, the ratio of SP-A1 to total
SP-A differs significantly in certain diseases such as
asthma, cystic fibrosis, and as a function of age [31, 66].
However, some differences have been observed among
individuals in the SP-A1/SP-A ratio with no reported
lung disease [47], pointing to the possibility that content
differences in SP-A1 and SP-A2 may reflect small
differences in lung function under non-disease condi-
tions and that these may get magnified in the presence
of an insult.
The SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3) variants displayed a significant
difference in airway hyperreactivity compared to SP-A1
(6A2, 6A4) variants in both males and females with
infection
and
methacholine
challenge.
Differences
between individual SP-A1 and SP-A2 variants were
observed. The 1A0 male differed from the 6A2 male but
exhibited similar lung function to 6A4 male; the 1A0-
female differed from both 6A2 and 6A4. Whereas the
1A3 males and females exhibited differences with both
6A2 and 6A4 males and females. The observed gene-
specific variant differences in lung functions between
SP-A1(6A2, 6A4) and SP-A2 (1A0, 1A3) variants may be
due to the amino acid differences among the SP-A
genes, located within the signal peptide, the collagen-
like domain, and the carbohydrate recognition domain
(CRD) regions of SP-A. The major amino acid differ-
ences that distinguish between SP-A1 and SP-A2 gene-
specific variants are located in the collagen-like domain.
SP-A1 has a cysteine and SP-A2 has an arginine at pos-
ition 85 of the precursor molecule. The presence of
Cys85 in SP-A1 may create a micro instability when
found within a collagen domain [43]. The amino acid
differences in the non-collagen domains of SP-A may
further contribute to the differences among variants.
Whether any of these are responsible for the observed
differences in the lung function between SP-A1 and SP-
A2 gene-specific variants remains to be determined.
Conclusion
In summary: 1) the SP-A variants exhibited significant
sex differences in lung function mechanics in response
to infection alone and to infection plus methacholine; 2)
In response to infection alone: a) no significant differ-
ences were observed in pressure-volume (PV) curves
among the variants in either males or females; b) the SP-
A2 (1A3) and SP-A1 (6A2) exhibited similar inspiratory
capacity (A) and static compliance (Cst) in co-ex males,
but
in
females,
all
the
variants
exhibited
similar
inspiratory capacity and static compliance; c) the intrin-
sic elastic properties of the respiratory system (shape
constant k and area) were similar in both males and fe-
males. 3) In response to infection plus methacholine: a)
the SP-A2 (1A3) gene variant exhibited higher lung func-
tion compared to SP-A2 (1A0), except for Crs for either
sex; b) the SP-A1 (6A2, 6A4) gene variants exhibited di-
verse changes in lung function in the parameters studied
for both sexes; c) the single gene products exhibited sig-
nificantly increased lung function mechanics compared
to co-ex. Based on our observations, we speculate that if
an individual is exposed to inhaled substances, their lung
function mechanics will differ depending on the genetics
of innate immune molecules such as the SP-A1 and SP-
A2 variants.
