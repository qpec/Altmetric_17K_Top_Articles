Abstract
Although cross-sectional studies suggest that cognitive aging starts in midlife, few longitudi-
nal studies have documented within-individual declines in cognitive performance before the
seventh decade. Learning from repeat testing, or practice effects, can mask the decline in
younger cohorts. In women, the menopause transition also affects test performance and
can confound estimates of underlying decline. We designed this study to determine if, after
controlling for practice effects, the menopause transition, and the symptoms associated
with it, there is evidence of cognitive aging in midlife women. We used data from a longitudi-
nal observational study in 2,124 participants from the Study of Women’s Health Across the
Nation. Outcomes examined were scores on annual tests of processing speed, verbal epi-
sodic memory (immediate and delayed), and working memory. To reduce the impact of
practice effects and of the menopause transition, we used the third cognition testing visit as
the baseline. Average age at this baseline was 54 years, and the majority of the women
were postmenopausal; half the cohort was 2 or more years beyond the final menstrual
period. There were 7,185 cognition assessments with median follow-up time of 6.5 years. In
mixed effects regression, adjusted for practice effects, retention, menopause symtoms
(depressive, anxiety, vasomotor, and sleep disturbance), and covariates, scores on 2 of 4
cognition tests declined. Mean decline in cognitive speed was 0.28 per year (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 0.20 to 0.36) or 4.9% in 10 years, and mean decline in verbal episodic
memory (delayed testing) was 0.02 per year (95% CI: 0.00 to 0.03) or 2% in 10 years. Our
results provide strong, longitudinal evidence of cognitive aging in midlife women, with sub-
stantial within-woman declines in processing speed and memory. Further research is
needed to identify factors that influence decline rates and to develop interventions that slow
cognitive aging.

 Introduction
Although decline in cognitive functioning is common in older ages [1,2], there is controversy
about whether there is significant decline in cognitive abilities in midlife. Inverse associations
between age and cognitive functioning have been seen in cross-sectional analyses of data from
middle-aged adults [3,4]; yet within-person longitudinal declines in cognitive performance
have not been consistently documented in those under 60 years of age [5,6]. One large study
that assessed cognitive performance 3 times over 10 years, did demonstrate longitudinal
declines in cognitive performance in midlife, albeit at a slower rate than that of older adults
[7].
Yet, in midlife women going through the menopause transition (MT), at least 2 cohorts
found no evidence of cognitive aging; instead they documented significant improvements in
performance over multiple years [8,9]. Similar improvements in cognitive performance in mid-
life have been documented in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, and attributed to
learning or practice effects from repeat testing [10]. The phenomenon of learning from repeat
testing has long been recognized as hampering the estimation of underlying longitudinal
change in cognitive performance, and is thought to lead to underestimation—even masking—
of true decline [4,6,10,11,12].
Practice effects are largest at first re-testing and diminish significantly with further re-test-
ing [13,14]. We therefore, undertook an analysis of longitudinal cognitive performance data in
midlife women from the Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), after exclud-
ing data from SWAN’s first 2 cognition testing visits to reduce the impact of practice effects. It
has also been suggested that the MT and associated symptoms may impair performance
[8,14,15]; both may have confounded previous studies that failed to find evidence of cognitive
aging in midlife women. The majority of the SWAN cohort was post menopausal at 3rd cogni-
tion testing; thus commencing analysis at 3rd testing reduces effects of the MT on estimates of
cognitive performance trajectories. We hypothesized that, after largely eliminating practice
effects by initiating our analysis at the 3rd third testing occasion, and explicitly controlling for
the MT and associated symptoms, midlife women would indeed show gradual declines in cog-
nitive performance.
Methods
SWAN is a community-based, longitudinal study of midlife women. Entry requirements were:
42 to 52 years of age; intact uterus; at least one ovary; no estrogen use; and at least one men-
strual period in the 3 months prior. Seven study sites together recruited 3302 women [16]; the
baseline visit occured in 1996/97, and participants were followed annually thereafter. SWAN
participants provided written informed consent, and approval was obtained from Institutional
Review Boards at each of the seven SWAN clinical sites and the SWAN coordinating center—
Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; Rush University Medical Center, Chicago, IL;
University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI; University of California, Los Angeles, CA; Albert Ein-
stein Medical College, New York, NY; Kaiser Permanente Northern California, Oakland, CA;
University of California, Davis, CA; and University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA. Cognition
testing was first administered at the 4th follow-up to 2709 women, and repeated in 6th and sub-
sequent visits up to the 12th follow-up, except that only half the cohort was tested in the 8th fol-
low-up and the remainder in the 9th, and there was no cognition testing in the 11th follow-up.
Study Sample
Of the 2709 women in the SWAN cognition cohort, 2168 (80%) had testing at 3 or more visits
—an inclusion criterion for this analysis, which used the 3rd cognition testing as baseline.

Competing Interests: The authors have declared
that no competing interests exist.
 Because only 21 (<1%) were from the Hudson County (New Jersey) site, they were excluded;
an additional 23 were excluded because of a stroke before their 3rd test, leaving a sample of
2124. Because cognitive aging may accelerate after the menopause [17], we created a subsam-
ple of 1224 women whose date of final menstrual period (FMP) was known; FMP date may be
unknowable due to interim hysterectomy and/or use of exogenous sex hormones.
Measurements
Outcomes.
Cognitive processing speed was assessed with the the symbol digit modalities
test (SDMT), in which participants match numbers to symbols in a specified time period [18];
score range, 0–110. Verbal episodic memory was evaluated using the East Boston Memory test
(EBMT) [19]: Respondents recall story elements from a paragraph read to them, immediately
and after ~10 minutes delay; score range, 0–12. Working memory, the ability to manipulate
information held in memory, was assessed by digit span backwards (DSB) [20]: Participants
repeat strings of single-digit numbers backwards, with 2 trials at each string length, increasing
from 2 to 7, stopped after errors in both trials at a string length, and scored as the number of
correct trials (range, 0–12).
Covariates.
At SWAN baseline, questionnaires collected age, race/ethnicity, and educa-
tion. Annually administered questionnaires assessed financial hardship (difficulty paying for
basics), diabetes mellitus, sex hormone use, interim hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorec-
tomy, MT stage (premenopausal: no change in menses regularity, early perimenopausal: men-
ses within the prior 3 months but less predictable, late perimenopausal: > 3 months but < 12
months of amenorrhea, postmenopausal: �12 months without menses, and indeterminate
because of premenopausal hysterectomy or use of sex steroid hormones before the MT is com-
pleted), and FMP date. The Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) Scale quan-
tified depressive symptoms [21], and coded present if in the top quartile (�13). Anxiety
symptoms were assessed using the SWAN anxiety score [22], and coded present if in the top
quartile (�7). Sleep disturbance was assessed using an abbreviated Pittsburgh Sleep Quality
Index, and coded present if either difficulty falling asleep, waking up several times, or waking
up earlier than planned with inability to fall asleep again were reported for �3 nights per week
[23]. Vasomotor symptoms were coded present if any of hot flashes, cold sweats, or night
sweats occurred �6 days per week [22].
Statistical Analysis
After excluding scores from the first 2 cognition testing occasions, we examined LOESS-
smoothed plots of cognition scores as a function of ‘time from FMP’ (negative for dates before
the FMP and positive for dates after; a proxy for ovarian aging) and ‘time elapsed since the 3rd
cognition testing’ (a measure of chronological aging). Time from FMP more closely captures
biological aging in a midlife woman, because of the large changes around the FMP not only in
sex hormone levels but also in multiple other physiological markers [24,25,26]. At least one
prior study found that cognitive aging accelerates after the menopause [17].
The LOESS plots showed steady declines in the mean values of each of the 4 cognition
scores as time from FMP increased (SDMT: Fig 1, EBMT-Delayed: Fig 2, EBMT-Immediate
and DSB: not shown). In contrast, the LOESS plots against ‘time since 3rd testing occasion’
showed gradual decline only in SDMT (Fig 3), and not in the other scores (data not shown),
and revealed a persistent learning/practice effect from the 3rd to 4th testing in all scores.
We fit linear growth curves to the repeated measurements of each cognition score as func-
tion of time from FMP, allowing for a residual practice/learning effect from the 3rd to 4th test-
ing, and censoring observations after an incident stroke. We used linear mixed effects

 regression with a random intercept at the participant level to account for clustering of repeated
observations from the same woman. Covariates, chosen for known or hypothesized relation to
cognitive performance, were modeled as fixed effects on the level (intercept), and included
the following time-fixed variables: age at FMP, education (�high school, some college,

any chronological aging effects prior to the FMP, and isolates biological aging effects related to

 3rd testing and 1 for �4th), use of sex steroid hormone therapy (yes/no), bilateral oophorec-
tomy before natural menopause (yes/no), diabetes (yes/no), and MT-associated symtoms
(depressive, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor). Analyses were conducted using com-
plete cases (no covariates missing).
To examine the relation between cognitive performance and chronlogical aging, we ran
parallel models that fit linear growth curves to the cognition scores as a function of time since
3rd cognition testing, with all the same covariates except that age at FMP was replaced by age at
the 3rd cognition testing (to capture cross-sectional age differences in cognition). We included
one additional time-varying covariate, MT stage at the time of testing, to remove effects of the
MT, and isolate chronological aging effects. Because this analysis did not require an FMP date,
it was done in the larger sample of 2124 participants who met study entry criteria (except not
requiring known date of FMP).
Results
The study sample was similar to the SWAN cognition cohort (Table 1). At the 3rd cognition
testing (baseline for this analysis), median age was 54 years (interquartile range 52 to 56), and
the majority of the women were post-menopausal. Nearly half were Caucasian, and the major-
ity were tested in English. About a quarter had post-graduate education. The FMP subsample
was very similar to the study sample (Table 1); at the baseline for this analysis, half of these
women were at least 2 years past the FMP.
In the study sample and FMP subsample, the mean number of cognition testing occasions
available for analysis was 3.4, but the majority of women participated in all 4 cognitive visits
(at the 7th, either 8th or 9th, 10th, and 12th follow-ups). There was a total of 7,185 repeated
assessments in the study sample, and 4,163 in the FMP subsample. Some women did not com-
plete all 4 cognition tests at every testing occasion: in the study sample, there were 31 missing
SDMT scores, 2 missing EBMT immediate recall, 6 missing EBMT delayed recall, and 171
missing DSB scores; corresponding missing numbers in the FMP subsample were 18, 0, 2, and
94. The median length of follow-up was 6.5 years (interquartile range 5.2 to 6.8) in the study
sample, and 6.5 years (interquartile range 5.6 to 6.8) in the FMP subsample.
In linear, mixed effects regression in the FMP subsample, adjusted for age at the FMP, prac-
tice (learning) from the 3rd to the 4th testing, and retention, SDMT scores decreased on average
by 0.27 per year (p < .0001), and EBMT delayed recall scores decreased on average by 0.02 per
year (p = 0.01). These declines persisted after additional adjustment for education, race/ethnic-
ity, testing language, clinical site, financial hardship, oophorectomy, sex hormone use, diabe-
tes, and symptoms of depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and vasomotor instabily,
although the decline in EBMT-delayed recall scores became marginally significant (Table 2,
ovarian aging model). Between-women difference in SDMT score by age at FMP (0.31 decline
per year) was nearly identical in magnitude to the longitudinal aging effect (0.28 decline per
year). There were no cross-sectional or longitudinal aging effects seen for the other 2 cognition
test scores: EBMT immediate recall and DSB (Table 2).
There were also strong practice effects in SDMT, but not in the other 3 test scores: mean
SDMT learning from 3rd to 4th testing was 0.62 (p = 0.01). In addition, there were retention
effects seen in 3 of the 4 tests; scores were higher in those who were tested more often: SDMT
(p = 0.0001), EBMT delayed recall (p = 0.04) and DSB (p = 0.06).
The second set of models examined test scores as a function of chronological aging—calen-
dar time since the 3rd cognition testing—and yielded similar findings. Adjusted only for age
at the 3rd testing, practice from the 3rd to 4th fourth testing, and retention, SDMT scores
decreased on average by 0.24 per year (p < .0001). This decline persisted in the fully adjusted

 model (Table 2, chronological aging model). Between-women difference in SDMT score by
age at 3rd testing was more than double the longitudinal aging effect: 0.54 vs. 0.25 decline per
year (Table 2). There were no longitudinal aging effects seen for the other 3 cognition tests,
but there was a cross-sectional age effect on DSB scores (Table 2). As before, there were strong
practice (0.60; p = 0.001) and retention effects (p<0.0001) on SDMT scores. There was also a
positive retention effect on EBMT immediate recall (p = 0.02) and EBMT delayed recall
(p = 0.0005).
To remove residual confounding by persisting practice effects, we conducted a sensitivity
analysis in which we ran the mixed effects models after dropping data from the 3rd cognition

 testing and allowing for a practice effect from 4th to 5th testing. Longitudinal aging estimates
from the fully adjusted models were somewhat larger: SDMT declined 0.35 per year (95% con-
fidence interval [CI]: 0.24, 0.46) in the ovarian aging model (2,926 observations from 1,130
women) and 0.25 per year (95% CI: 0.15, 0.36) in the chronological aging model (5,041 obser-
vations from 1,963 women).
Discussion
As hypothesized, after controlling for practice effects, the MT and MT symptoms, midlife
women did show longitudinal declines in cognitive performance, mainly in processing speed.
The average, within-woman rate of decline (longitudinal aging effect) in processing speed was
essentially identical to the average, between-women difference by age at time of FMP (0.28 per
year vs. 0.31 per year). However, as in previous studies [7], cross-sectional differences by chro-
nological age at time of testing were substantially larger than longitudinal aging effects (0.54
per year vs. 0.25 per year), likely because between-women differences in ovarian age were not
completely eliminated by controls for MT stage.
Previous studies have found that cognitive procesing speed is especially sensitive to early
changes [29,30,31]. We found longitudinal declines in both processing speed and verbal mem-
ory (delayed recall) in this study. The estimated decline rates translate to a 10-year reduction
of approximately 0.25 standard deviations (SD) of the baseline score or 4.9% of the mean base-
line score in processing speed, and 0.11 SD of the baseline score or 2.0% of the mean baseline
score in delayed recall. These rates are similar to the 10-year longitudinal decline of 3.6% in
reasoning score seen in 45–49 year old women in the Whitehall cohort [7]. Consistent with
previous work, we also did not see longitudinal declines in immediate recall and working
memory; however, more sensitive measures of episodic and working memory might indeed
show declines in midlife.
Although there is some evidence that circulating estrogen might protect premenopausal
women from cognitive aging [32,33], we did not see a sharp acceleration of cognitive decline
during or after the menopause transition (Figs 1 and 2). Instead, the rates of longitudinal
decline in SDMT scores were nearly identical regardless of whether time was indexed to the
date of the FMP (ovarian aging model) or measured from study baseline (chronological aging
model). However, MT-related declines in circulating estradiol level start 2 years before the
FMP, and declines in other estrogen-dependent biological systems, such as bone, commence
well before the FMP [26,34]. Because 75% of participants in the current analysis were 52 years
of age or older at study baseline and the mean age at FMP was 52, the vast majority were “past”
the time when an estradiol-related inflection in the cognitive performance trajectory might
occur. The likelihood of such an inflection in cognitive performance trajectory prior to the
FMP is supported by our finding that between-women differences by age at FMP were smaller
than between-women differences by age at time of testing.
As in older cohorts, we also saw a retention effect in this midlife cohort: Cognitive perfor-
mance was better in women who stayed in the study longer, although attrition was not primar-
ily due to death in this cohort. At least one other study found similar differences by retention
in cognitive performance in the 6th decade, but concluded that selective retention did not bias
estimates of longitudinal cognitive decline [35].
Limitations of our study include the inability described above to detect initiation or
acceleration of cognitive decline at the time that estrogen starts declining, absence of men
from the study, and limited generalizability to women not represented in this study, including
those who use sex hormones during the MT, who had a hysterectomy without bilateral

 oophorectomy prior to natural menopause, who were too ill to participate, from less developed
economies, and women from race/ethnicity groups not represented in SWAN.
In conclusion, this study provides good new evidence of cognitive aging in women in mid-
life, with significant longitudinal declines in both processing speed and verbal memory. Unlike
previous longitudinal studies in midlife that were based on 3 or fewer cognition assessments,
and could not adequately account for practice effects, we analyzed up to 6 annual or biennial
assessements, allowing us to minimize the impact of practice effects and unmask declines.
Practice effects are larger in younger, cognitively intact individuals than in older adults [36]
and can dominate over the smaller declines in cognitive performance in midlife; more com-
plete elimination of practice effects may show that midlife declines are even steeper.
A decline in processing speed in midlife is not a harbinger of declines in other domains of
functioning [37], there are individual differences in cognitive aging, and resilience and com-
pensatory mechanisms can ameliorate the impact of cognitive aging on functioning and well-
being [38]. Cognitive aging may also be malleable [39,40]. Further research is needed to deter-
mine factors that influence differential rates of decline in cognitive performance with an eye
towards developing interventions aimed at slowing cognitive aging.
