ABSTRACT
ObjeCtive
To determine whether height and body mass index 
(BMI) have a causal role in five measures of 
socioeconomic status.
Design
Mendelian randomisation study to test for causal 
effects of differences in stature and BMI on five 
measures of socioeconomic status. Mendelian 
randomisation exploits the fact that genotypes are 
randomly assigned at conception and thus not 
confounded by non-genetic factors.
setting
UK Biobank.
PartiCiPants
119 669 men and women of British ancestry, aged 
between 37 and 73 years.
Main OutCOMe Measures
Age completed full time education, degree level 
education, job class, annual household income, and 
Townsend deprivation index.
results
In the UK Biobank study, shorter stature and higher 
BMI were observationally associated with several 
measures of lower socioeconomic status. The 
associations between shorter stature and lower 
socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in men, 
and the associations between higher BMI and lower 
socioeconomic status tended to be stronger in women. 
For example, a 1 standard deviation (SD) higher BMI 
was associated with a £210 (€276; $300; 95% 
confidence interval £84 to £420; P=6×10−3) lower 
annual household income in men and a £1890 (£1680 
to £2100; P=6×10−15) lower annual household income 
in women. Genetic analysis provided evidence that 
these associations were partly causal. A genetically 
determined 1 SD (6.3 cm) taller stature caused a 0.06 
(0.02 to 0.09) year older age of completing full time 
education (P=0.01), a 1.12 (1.07 to 1.18) times higher 
odds of working in a skilled profession (P=6×10−7), and 
a £1130 (£680 to £1580) higher annual household 
income (P=4×10−8). Associations were stronger in men. 
A genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI (4.6 kg/m2) 
caused a £2940 (£1680 to £4200; P=1×10−5) lower 
annual household income and a 0.10 (0.04 to 0.16) SD 
(P=0.001) higher level of deprivation in women only.
COnClusiOns
These data support evidence that height and BMI play 
an important partial role in determining several 
aspects of a person’s socioeconomic status, especially 
women’s BMI for income and deprivation and men’s 
height for education, income, and job class. These 
findings have important social and health 
implications, supporting evidence that overweight 
people, especially women, are at a disadvantage and 
that taller people, especially men, are at an advantage.
Introduction
Higher socioeconomic status is associated with better 
health and longer life.1 2  For example, a recent article 
highlighted the strength of the association between 
wealth and health by pointing out the 18 and 20 year 
gaps in male life expectancy between the least and 
most wealthy parts of London, UK, and Baltimore, USA, 
respectively.3  Two easily measured markers associated 
with socioeconomic status are adult height and body 
mass index (BMI).4-6  In developed counties, taller stat-
ure and lower BMI are associated with higher socio-
economic status and better health.4-12 Higher 
socioeconomic status is generally thought to cause 
taller stature and lower BMI owing to higher standards 
of nutrition in childhood, but there may also be effects 
in the opposite direction—taller stature and lower BMI 
may causally improve socioeconomic status through 
discrimination against shorter and fatter people or dif-
ferences in self esteem that affect employability.13 14 
 
Evidence as to whether height and BMI have causal 
effects on socioeconomic status through these, or other, 
pathways is limited. For example, to our knowledge, no 
large studies have compared siblings or twins of

Socioeconomic status influences morbidity and mortality, with a recent review

and richest boroughs of London
Taller stature and lower body mass index (BMI) are associated with higher 
socioeconomic status, but the causal directions of these associations are poorly 
understood
Understanding the causal directions of these associations is important for public 
health and wellbeing policies
WhAT ThIS STudy AddS
This study provides a high level of evidence (using 119 000 participants from the UK 
Biobank) for a causal effect from shorter stature and higher BMI to lower measures 
of socioeconomic status
Shorter height, as estimated by genetics, leads to lower levels of education, lower 
job status, and less income in men in particular, and higher BMI leads to lower 
income and greater deprivation in women
Genetic evidence has the advantage of being largely free from the problems that 
afflict observational studies; analyses using inherited DNA variation are much more 
robust to confounding, bias, and reverse causality

different heights and BMIs, where childhood environ-
ment could be controlled for. If differences in BMI and 
height can lead to differences in socioeconomic status, 
this would have implications for policy makers. For 
example, evidence of a causal link would further high-
light the need to adjust for unconscious biases in deci-
sion making in education and employment.
Gene based analyses, such as mendelian randomisa-
tion,15  can be used to test for a causal relation between 
socioeconomic status and a genetically influenced phe-
notype such as BMI. Genetic variants can act as uncon-
founded proxies for the risk factors under 
investigation—here, BMI and height—because inherited 
genetic variation is randomly allocated at conception. 
The outcomes being tested—here, measures of socio-
economic status—cannot influence genetic variation, 
so reverse causality is avoided in genetic studies. 
 
Figure 1  illustrates the principle of mendelian randomi-
sation. Previous studies have used genetic variants to 
test causal relation between health traits such as BMI 
and socioeconomic status related outcomes such as 
academic performance. However, these studies were 
limited by a lack of genetic variants robustly associated 
with BMI and by sample sizes of fewer than 2300 peo-
ple.16 17  Recent genome-wide association studies have 
identified many 10s and 100s of genetic variants associ-
ated with BMI and height, respectively,18 
19 and so pro-
vide the tools for mendelian randomisation tests.
Here, we used mendelian randomisation analysis to 
test the hypothesis that causal pathways link BMI and 
height to differences in five different measures of socio-
economic status. We used the first release of data from 
the UK Biobank. The UK Biobank has 119 669 partici-
pants of white British ancestry with genetic data, mea-
sures of socioeconomic status, and height and BMI 
measures. The UK Biobank thus represents a very 
 
powerful resource in which to investigate the causal 
relation between BMI, height, and socioeconomic sta-
tus by using mendelian randomisation analysis.
Methods
uK biobank
The UK Biobank recruited more than 500 000 people 
aged 37-73 years (99.5% were between 40 and 69 years) 
from across the country in 2006-10. Participants pro-
vided a range of information via questionnaires and 
interviews (such as demographics, health status, and 
lifestyle); anthropometric measurements, blood pres-
sure readings, and blood, urine and saliva samples 
were taken for future analysis. This has been described 
in more detail elsewhere.20  We used 120 286 partici-
pants of white British descent from the initial UK Bio-
bank dataset, of whom 119 669 had valid genetic data 
and both BMI and height measures available. We did 
not include other ethnic groups, because individually 
they were underpowered. Table 1 shows the basic char-
acteristics of the sample. We defined people of white 
British descent as those who both self identified as 
white British and were confirmed as ancestrally “Cauca-
sian” using principal components analyses of genome-
wide genetic information. This dataset underwent 
extensive central quality control (http://biobank.ctsu.
ox.ac.uk) (see supplementary methods).
Patient involvement
This study was conducted using the UK Biobank 
resource. Details of patient and public involvement in 
the UK Biobank are available online (www.ukbiobank.
ac.uk/about-biobank-uk/ and https://www.ukbiobank.
ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Summary-EGF-con-
sultation.pdf?phpMyAdmin=trmKQlYdjjnQIgJ%2C-
fAzikMhEnx6). No patients were specifically involved in 
setting the research question or the outcome measures, 
nor were they involved in developing plans for recruit-
ment, design, or implementation of this study. No 
patients were asked to advise on interpretation or writ-
ing up of results. There are no specific plans to dissemi-
nate the results of the research to study participants, 
but the UK Biobank disseminates key findings from 
projects on its website.
exposure and outcome measures
Exposure and outcome measures were all collected at 
baseline when participants attended the assessment 
centre.
Height
Height (cm) was measured using a Seca 202 device in all 
participants in the UK Biobank (n=500 120). Sitting 
height was also measured (n=496 380). We excluded 
one person with a height more than 4.56 SD away from 
the mean and a sitting height to standing height ratio of 
greater than 0.75, which is not compatible with normal 
growth. In all, 119 669 people of white British ancestry 
with genetic data available also had a valid height and 
BMI measure.

Fig 1 | Principle of mendelian randomisation: if height or body mass index (bMi) causally 
influences socioeconomic status, genetic variants associated with that trait will also be 
associated with socioeconomic status. as genotype is assigned at conception, it should 
not be associated with factors that normally confound the association between bMi and 
height and socioeconomic status (eg, environmental and behavioural factors). We can 
use our estimates of the genetic-height/bMi association (w) and the genetic-
socioeconomic status association (x) to infer the causal effect of height or bMi on 
socioeconomic status (y=x/w), which is expected to be free from confounding. if the 
estimated causal effect (y) is different from the observational association between the 
height or bMi and socioeconomic status, this would suggest that the observational 
association is confounded (assuming that the assumptions of the mendelian 
randomisation analyses are valid). snP=single nucleotide polymorphism

Body mass index
The UK Biobank has two different measures of BMI—
one calculated as weight/height2 and one measured 
using electrical impedance to quantify mass. We 
excluded people with significant differences (>4.56 SD 
from the mean) between impedance and normal BMI 
measures (n=1172) where both variables were available. 
If only one measure of BMI was available, we used this 
(n=7290). Valid BMI was available for 119 669 people 
with genetic and height data available.
Socioeconomic status
We used five different socioeconomic status variables.1 
 
Age in years at completion of full time education (ques-
tionnaire based; available only for people who did not go 
on to degree level education). Data were available for 
82 543 people and missing in 37 126 people with valid 
height, BMI, and genetic data.2  Education (coded as 
degree level or not, derived from the questionnaire); par-
ticipants were asked, “Which of the following qualifica-
tions do you have? (You can select more than one),” with 
the options college or university degree, A levels or equiv-
alent, O levels or GCSEs or equivalent, CSEs, NVQ/HND/
HNC, professional qualifications (eg, nursing or teach-
ing). We created a dichotomous variable comparing 
degree level education or professional qualifications 
(n=53 652) with other qualifications (n=64 913); 1104 peo-
ple did not respond to this question.3  Job class (coded as 
elementary occupations, process plant and machine 
operatives, sales and customer service occupations, lei-
sure and other personal service occupations, personal 
service occupations, skilled trades, administrative and 
secretarial roles, business and public sector associate 
professionals, associate professionals, professional occu-
pations, and managers and senior officials); this was 
coded from the UK Biobank job code variable. All partici-
pants were asked to select their current or most recent job. 
Data were available for 76 404 people, with missing data 
in 43 265. We dichotomised this variable into unskilled 
(n=21 036; elementary occupations to personal service 
occupations) and skilled (n=55 698; skilled trades to man-
agers and senior officials).4  A categorical income variable 
(questionnaire based),  
representing annual household 
income of <£18 000 (€23 600; $25 800), £18 000 to 
£30 999, £31 000 to £51 999, £52 000 to £100 000, and 
>£100 000. Data were available for 103 327 people

and missing in 16 432  
people with valid height, BMI, and 
genetic data.5 Townsend deprivation index (a composite 
measure of deprivation based on unemployment, non-car 
ownership, non-home ownership, and household over-
crowding; a negative value represents high socioeco-
nomic status). This was calculated before participants 
joined the UK Biobank and was based on the preceding 
national census data, with each participant assigned a 
score corresponding to the postcode of their home dwell-
ing. Data were available for 119 519 people and missing in 
150 people with valid height, BMI, and genetic data.
For each of the five traits, we compared participants 
missing data with those reporting data; generally, those 
with missing data were older and shorter with higher 
BMIs (supplementary table A). We investigated the rela-
tion of these five socioeconomic status measures and 
four health outcomes: self reported coronary artery dis-
ease, hypertension (defined as a systolic blood pressure 
≥140, a diastolic blood pressure ≥90, or the report of use 
of blood pressure lowering drugs), any self reported long 
term illness (based on the UK Biobank question “Do you 
have a long standing illness, disability or infirmity?”), 
and type 2 diabetes (based on self report, excluding peo-
ple using insulin in the first year after diagnosis and 
those given a diagnosis before 35 years of age or within 
the previous year) (supplementary table B).
For three of the traits (the exceptions being education 
and job class, both binary traits), we converted the data 
to a normal distribution to limit the influence of any 
subtle population stratification and to provide standard 
deviation effect sizes. We took residuals of the exposure 
and outcome measures from standard linear regression 
by using nine covariates: age, sex, assessment centre 
location, five (within UK) ancestry principal compo-
nents, and microarray used to measure genotypes. We 
then inverse normalised the residualised variables. To 
convert our results back to meaningful units after men-
delian randomisation, we multiplied our SD βs by a 1 SD 
change in the socioeconomic status measure. For exam-
ple, a 1 SD change in Townsend deprivation index was 
equivalent to 2.68 units. Therefore, a 0.05 SD change 
equated to a 0.134 unit change in deprivation.
Observational associations
We regressed each socioeconomic status measure against 
height and BMI by using linear regression for continuous 
outcome variables and logistic regression for binary out-
comes. We adjusted these associations for age and sex. 
We also investigated the association of each socioeco-
nomic status measure with a range of health outcomes.
genetic variants
The genetic variants used were extracted genotypes 
from UK Biobank’s imputation dataset (the supplemen-
tary methods provide more information on the UK 
 
Biobank’s quality control). We excluded individual gen-
otypes if the genotype probability was less than 0.9. We 
confirmed that the variants were imputed with high 
quality by comparing them with the directly genotyped 
data, where available. Details of imputation quality are 
given in supplementary table C.
Height—We selected 396 of 404 height genetic vari-
ants from independent loci that were associated with 
height at genome-wide significance in the GIANT stud-
ies of up to 253 288 people (supplementary table C).19 
We excluded eight variants that were unavailable 
(rs1420023, rs567401), were poorly imputed, had an 
imputation quality <0.9 (rs11683207
, rs7534365), or were 
not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<1×10−6; 
rs1401795, rs7692995, rs915506, rs3790086). The 396 
variants explained 12.3% of the variance in adult height 
in the UK Biobank participants used.
Body mass index—We selected 69 of 76 common 
genetic variants that were associated with BMI at 
genome-wide significance in the GIANT consortium in 
studies of up to 339 224 people (supplementary table C).18 
We limited the BMI variants to those that were associ-
ated with BMI in the analysis of all people of European 
ancestry and did not include those that reached genome-
wide levels of statistical confidence in only one sex or 
one stratum. We also excluded variants if they were 
known to be classified as a secondary signal within a 
locus. Three variants were excluded from the score 
owing to potential pleiotropy (rs11030104 (BDNF reward 
phenotypes), rs13107325 (SLC39A8 lipids, blood pres-
sure), rs3888190 (SH2B1 multiple traits)), three were not 
in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P<1×10−6 ; rs17001654, 
rs2075650, rs9925964), and one was unavailable 
(rs2033529). The 69 variants explained 1.5% of the vari-
ance in BMI in the UK Biobank participants.
We recoded individual variants as 0, 1, and 2 accord-
ing to the number of height or BMI increasing alleles. 
We used the variants to create height and BMI genetic 
risk scores. Each variant was weighted by its relative 
effect size (β coefficient) obtained from the reported 
meta-analysis data.18 We created a weighted score, in 
which β is the β coefficient of representing the associ-
ation between each single nucleotide polymorphism 
(SNP) and height/BMI: weighted score=β1×SN-
P1+β2×SNP2+…βn×SNPn. We then rescaled the 
weighted score to reflect the number of trait increas-
ing alleles: weighted genetic risk score=(weighted 
score×number of SNPs)/sum of β coefficients.
Mendelian randomisation
The mendelian randomisation approach used in this 
study made the following assumptions:15  the height and 
BMI genetic risk scores were robustly associated with 
measured height and BMI; the height and BMI genetic 
risk scores were not associated with confounding factors 
that bias conventional epidemiological associations 
between height/BMI and socioeconomic status; the 
height and BMI genetic risk scores were related to the 
outcome only via its association with the modifiable 
exposure; and the associations represented in figure 1 
are linear and unaffected by statistical interactions.
Instrumental variable analysis
We used two methods that use genetic variants to assess 
causal relations between two traits. Firstly, to estimate 
the causal effect of height or BMI on individual 
 
socioeconomic status measures, we used instrumental

variable analysis using the height or BMI genetic risk 
score.15 We used the two stage, least squares estimator 
method that uses predicted levels of BMI or height per 
genotype and regresses each outcome against these 
predicted values.
For continuous socioeconomic status outcomes, we 
used the ivreg2 command in Stata to do the instrumen-
tal variable analysis. We compared results from obser-
vational and instrumental variable regressions by using 
the Durbin-Wu-Hausman test for endogeneity, which 
examines the difference between the estimates from lin-
ear regression (observational) and instrumental vari-
able analysis.21
For binary outcomes, the instrumental variable anal-
ysis was done in two stages. Firstly, we assessed the 
association between the height or BMI genetic risk 
score and height or BMI, respectively. We saved the pre-
dicted values and residuals from this regression model. 
Secondly, we used the predicted values from stage 1 as 
the independent variable (reflecting an unconfounded 
estimate of variation in BMI or height) and degree sta-
tus or job class as the dependent variable in a logistic or 
ordinal logistic regression model. We used robust stan-
dard errors to correct for uncertainty in the estimate. We 
examined the F statistics from first stage regressions to 
evaluate the strength of the instruments; weak instru-
ments can bias results towards the (confounded) multi-
variable regression association or towards the null in a 
two stage design.22 
23
Egger method
We used a second method of mendelian randomisation, 
the Egger method,24  as a sensitivity analysis if the 
instrumental variables test result was noteworthy. This 
method is more robust to potential violations of the 
standard instrumental variable assumptions. It uses a 
weighted regression with an unconstrained intercept to 
regress the effect sizes of variant-outcome associations 
(here, height or BMI variants versus socioeconomic sta-
tus measures) against effect sizes of variant-risk factor 
associations (here, height or BMI variants versus height 
or BMI). The unconstrained intercept removes the 
assumption that all genetic variants are valid instru-
mental variables, so this method is less susceptible to 
confounding from potentially pleiotropic variants that 
will probably have stronger effects on outcomes com-
pared with their effects on the primary trait. The 
approach is analogous to correcting for small study 
publication bias in meta-analyses.24  Details of the Stata 
and R code used are provided in Bowden et al 2015.24
To ensure the robustness of our findings, we have 
highlighted results only where we see consistent results 
across the two different methods.
Differences between men and women
To test the hypothesis that the effects of height and BMI 
on socioeconomic status may differ in men and women, 
we repeated observational and genetic analyses sepa-
rately in each sex. The selected height and BMI genetic 
variants have very similar effects in men and women, so 
we used the same genetic risk scores in all participants, 
men only, and women only. We compared the β values 
for men and women by using Fisher’s z score method25: 
z=(β1−β2)/√(SE12 +SE22).
sensitivity analyses
In a sensitivity analysis to further confirm that our 
results were robust to any potential influence of popula-
tion stratification, we used the linear mixed models 
approach as implemented in the software BOLT-LMM.26 
This approach corrects for all levels of inter-individual 
correlation of genotypes due to relatedness, from close 
relatives to cryptic relatedness caused by population 
stratification. We inverse normalised the socioeco-
nomic status measures, then took the residuals using 
three covariates (age, sex, assessment centre location) 
and inverse normalised again.
Results
Table 1  summarises the demographics of the 119 669 UK 
Biobank participants with valid genetic data and BMI 
and height measures. The height and BMI genetic risk 
scores were robustly associated with height and BMI 
(table 1). The association between the socioeconomic 
status measures and health outcomes and the associa-
tions between known height variants and height and 
known BMI variants and BMI in the UK Biobank are 
summarised in supplementary tables A-C.

Education: duration in full time education
Using 82 543 participants, we found that taller stature 
was strongly correlated with participants spending lon-
ger in full time education (table 2 ). This association was 
similar in men and women. A 1 SD (6.3 cm) greater 
height was associated with a 0.11 (95% confidence inter-
val 0.10 to 0.12) SD older age (approximately 0.2 years) 
at which full time education was completed. Genetic 
analyses provided evidence that this association was 
partly causal—a genetically determined 1 SD (6.3 cm) 
higher height was associated with a 0.03 (0.01 to 0.05) 
SD older age (approximately 0.06 (0.02 to 0.10) years) at 
which full time education was completed (table 2, sup-
plementary figure A-I).
Education: degree level (or equivalent) or not
Using 118 565 participants, we found that taller stature 
was strongly correlated with participants’ chances of 
having obtained a degree. A 1 SD (6.3 cm) greater height 
was associated with 1.25 (1.24 to 1.27) increased odds of 
reporting degree level education. This association was 
similar in men and women (P for comparison>0.05). 
Genetic analyses provided no consistent evidence for a 
causal role of height in obtaining degree level educa-
tion (table 2, supplementary figure A-II).

working in skilled job roles (odds ratio 1.29, 1.27 to 1.32). 
Genetic analyses provided evidence that this associa-
tion was partly causal—a 1 SD (6.3 cm) genetically 
 
determined higher height was associated with 
increased odds of working in more professional roles 
(odds ratio 1.12, 1.07 to 1.18) (table 2, supplementary fig-
ure A-III). This association was consistent when we ana-
lysed the data as 11 ordered job classes (supplementary 
table D). We found no genetic evidence that the effect 
was stronger in men or women.
Annual household income
Using 103 327 participants, we found that taller stature 
was strongly correlated with higher household income. 
The correlation was approximately 50% stronger in 
men (table 2 ). A 1 SD (6.3 cm) greater height was associ-
ated with a 0.13 (0.12 to 0.14) SD increase in income 
(table 2 ). This difference is approximately equivalent to 
a £2940 (£2730 to £3185) higher annual household 
income. Genetic analyses provided evidence that this 
association was partly causal—a genetically deter-
mined 1 SD (6.3 cm) greater height was associated with 
a 0.05 (0.03 to 0.07) SD increase in annual household 
income, equivalent to £1130 (£680 to £1580) (table 2 
and supplementary figure AIV). The genetic analyses 
showed that the effect was approximately twice as 
strong in men as in women (P for comparison=5×10−4); 
a 1 SD greater height in men caused a £1580 (£1130 to 
£2260) increase in household income (supplementary 
figure A-IV). This association was consistent when we 
analysed the data as five ordered income classes (sup-
plementary table D).
Townsend deprivation index
Using 119 519 participants, we found that taller stature 
was strongly correlated with lower levels of social depri-
vation, as measured by the Townsend deprivation index. 
This association was stronger in men than women. A 1 SD 
(6.3 cm) greater height was associated with a 0.08 (0.07 to 
0.09) SD lower deprivation, which is equivalent to a 0.21 
(0.18 to 0.24) unit reduction in Townsend deprivation 
index (table 2 ). Genetic analyses provided evidence that 
this association was partly causal in men but not when 
all participants or women were considered. In all partic-
ipants, genetically determined height was not associated 
with deprivation (table 2, supplementary figure A-V). In 
men, a genetically determined 1 SD (6.3 cm) greater 
height was associated with a 0.02 (0.00 to 0.05) SD reduc-
tion in deprivation (supplementary figure AV). This dif-
ference is equivalent to a 0.05 (0.00 to 0.13) unit lower 
Townsend index.

(table 3). A 1 SD (4.6 kg/m2) higher BMI was associated 
with a 0.08 (0.07 to 0.08) SD younger age (approxi-
mately 0.15 years) at which full time education was 
completed. We found no genetic evidence that this 
association was causal when considering all partici-
pants, men only, or women only (supplementary 
 
figure B-I).
Education: degree level (or equivalent or not)
Using 118 565 participants, we found that higher BMI 
was associated with lower odds of having obtained a 
degree. A 1 SD higher BMI was associated with lower 
odds of obtaining degree level education (odds ratio 
0.83, 0.82 to 0.84). We found no consistent genetic evi-
dence that this association was causal when consider-
ing all participants, men only, or women only 
(supplementary figure B-II).
Job class
Using 76 404 participants, we found that higher BMI 
was associated with employment in less skilled profes-
sions. A 1 SD (4.6 kg/m2) higher BMI was associated with 
lower odds of working in skilled job roles (0.91, 0.89 to 
0.92), and the association was stronger in women. We 
found no consistent genetic evidence that this associa-
tion was causal when considering all participants, men 
only, or women only (supplementary figure B-III). How-
ever, we found some evidence of causality when we 
analysed the data as 11 ordered job classes (supplemen-
tary table D).
Annual household income
Using 103 327 participants, we found that higher BMI 
was associated with a lower annual household income, 
but this effect was very strongly driven by the associa-
tion in women. A 1 SD higher BMI was associated with a 
0.09 (0.08 to 0.10) SD lower household income for 
women. This effect equates to £1890 (£1680 to £2100) 
less income per annum for women. In men, a 1 SD 
higher BMI approximated to a £210 (£84 to £420) lower 
annual household income. Genetic analyses were con-
sistent with these observations being causal in women 
but not in men (P for comparison with men=9×10−5)—a 
genetically determined 1 SD higher BMI was associated 
with an annual household income of 0.14 (0.08 to 0.20) 
SD less in women. This effect is equivalent to £2940 
(£1680 to £4200) less for women (table 3, supplemen-
tary figure B-IV). This association was consistent when 
we analysed the data as five ordered income classes 
(supplementary table D). The association between 
higher BMI and lower income was consistent in women 
who worked, with or without a husband/partner at 
home, and women who did not work with a husband/
partner at home (supplementary table E). It was also 
consistent when we considered only women without 
health conditions (supplementary table E).

0.08) SD higher deprivation value, which is equivalent to 
a 0.21 (0.19 to 0.21) unit increase in Townsend index 
(table 3 ). This association was twice as strong in women. 
We found limited genetic evidence of a causal relation 
between BMI and deprivation in men, but some evidence 
in women. A 1 SD genetically higher BMI was associated 
with a 0.10 (0.04 to 0.16) SD higher level of deprivation in 
women (table 3, Supplementary figure B-V).
sensitivity analyses
The Egger method provided consistent results for causal 
relations between height and duration in full time edu-
cation, job class, income, and Townsend deprivation 
index in men (table 2 , supplementary table F). The 
Egger method also provided evidence of consistent 
associations between higher BMI and income in women 
(table 3, supplementary table G). Use of genome-wide 
methods to account for genetic and socioeconomic sta-
tus correlations between close and distant relatives did 
not alter our findings (supplementary table H).
discussion
Using genetic variants as unconfounded proxies for 
height and BMI, our study provides evidence that 
shorter stature and higher BMI lead to lower measures 
of several aspects of socioeconomic status. It is import-
ant to note that our data are consistent with the height 
and BMI to socioeconomic status associations being 
only partly causal—we have not excluded a causal effect 
in the other direction. The study adds causal evidence 
to a large number of observational studies. This work 
may have important implications for public health, as 
low socioeconomic status increases mortality and mor-
bidity.2 
3 The association between socioeconomic status 
measures and health was strong in the UK Biobank 
data, where, for example, people possessing a univer-
sity degree had a 38% lower odds of coronary artery 
disease compared with those without degree level edu-
cation. Our study also showed sex differences in the 
causal relations between height or BMI and socioeco-
nomic status that are consistent with observational 
data. Height effects were stronger in men, but the BMI 
effects tended to be stronger in women.
evidence for taller stature leading to higher 
socioeconomic status
The causal effect, as estimated using genetics, of taller 
stature on higher socioeconomic status was present in 
four of the five measures of socioeconomic status. For 
income, where the statistical evidence was strongest, 
the estimated causal effects were approximately two to 
three times stronger in men than in women. The causal 
evidence for greater height leading to higher levels of 
socioeconomic status is consistent with observational 
studies, in which taller stature was associated with 
higher job class, earnings, and educational attain-
ment.4 5  One US based study showed a reduction in 
earnings of $789 per annum per inch of height. This 
equates to £1250 per SD (6.3 cm) of height in our study, 
which is very similar to our genetic estimate of £1130.13 
Despite the strong evidence that taller stature directly 
influences measures of socioeconomic status, the 
genetic estimates were consistently smaller than the 
observational estimates. These differences indicate that 
the observed association between taller stature and 
higher socioeconomic status is a mixture of direct 
causal effects and other factors that could include a 
causal effect in the opposite direction.
A range of factors could link taller stature to higher 
socioeconomic status, although this study did not con-
sider which of these factors were involved. Some of the 
possibilities include complex interactions between self 
esteem, stigma, positive discrimination,13  and 
increased intelligence.4 27 28  Evidence shows that self 
esteem, leadership perception, and height discrimina-
tion tend to be greater in men than in women, which fits 
with our findings.29-31
evidence for higher bMi leading to lower 
socioeconomic status
Higher BMI, as estimated using genetics, was causally 
associated with having a lower annual household 
income and higher levels of deprivation. These associa-
tions were stronger in women, with no consistent evi-
dence of a causal relation between higher BMI and lower 
socioeconomic status measures in men. These findings 
were consistent with previous literature, in which most 
associations of BMI with socioeconomic status were 
observed in women only.7 
32  We found no evidence that 
the associations between higher BMI and educational 
outcomes were causal, a result consistent with a review 
of the effect of BMI on social outcomes.32  Our findings 
add to evidence from observational studies, in which 
BMI is associated with lower levels of employment, less 
skilled work, and lower income.32 
33  A range of factors 
could link higher BMI to lower income and higher depri-
vation in women, although this study did not consider 
which of these factors were involved. One of the possibil-
ities is discrimination in the workplace, with overweight 
job applicants and employees being evaluated more 
negatively.32  The disparity between the sexes may be 
partially explained by discrimination, which may occur 
at lower weight levels for women than for men.34 
35  Addi-
tionally, cultivation theory in social science indicates 
that very thin women are idealised and more socially 
valued, compared with their normal weight and over-
weight peers.33  In contrast, a very different set of social 
standards exists regarding men’s weight, so discrimina-
tion based on body size could well be different in men 
and women.33 Two of the strongest measures in women 
were household income and Townsend deprivation, 
which are not just specific to the individual but also 
indicative of partner’s income. However, additional 
analyses showed that genetically determined higher 
BMI was associated with lower income both in

socioeconomic status, some qualifications should be 
considered. Firstly, the UK Biobank participants were 
born between 1938 and 1971, and the causal associa-
tions may not remain in today’s society or be generalis-
able to societies outside of the United Kingdom. The 
causal associations may have been influenced by 
parental genotype-socioeconomic status associations. 
For example, the causal pathway could reflect parental 
genetic predisposition to higher BMI resulting in fami-
lies moving to a more obese and lower socioeconomic 
status neighbourhood, which in turn could lower chil-
dren’s socioeconomic status. Because parents’ and chil-
dren’s genotypes are correlated, this pathway could 
lead to a genetic association between UK Biobank par-
ticipants’ socioeconomic status and BMI that reflects 
parental factors during the 20th century. However, such 
a pathway would be unlikely to result in genetic associ-
ations between BMI and socioeconomic status that 
were stronger in women than in men.
Secondly, higher BMI leads to poorer health; this 
could affect productivity, which in turn could affect 
socioeconomic status. However, we saw evidence of 
genetic associations between higher BMI and lower 
socioeconomic status in women reporting no adverse 
health outcomes as well as in those reporting health 
problems (supplementary table E). We also need to take 
care in interpreting negative results; although the large 
sample size of the UK Biobank provided greater than 
95% power for investigating the causal relations 
between height and socioeconomic status, power was 
limited for some of the causal associations for BMI. The 
SNPs selected for height and BMI may have effects on 
socioeconomic status not mediated by their effects on 
height or BMI (pleiotropy), which were not measured 
but could potentially affect socioeconomic status. How-
ever, to minimise this possibility, we selected SNPs 
carefully and used the Egger method, which can detect 
and adjust for pleiotropy bias in many scenarios24 
(hence the broader confidence intervals observed).
The educational, job status, and income data used in 
this study were self reported, which may result in mea-
surement bias. However, Townsend deprivation index 
was derived by the UK Biobank and we observed consis-
tent trends across the different socioeconomic status 
constructs, suggesting limited bias due to self report. 
Socioeconomic status is a very complex multidimen-
sional construct. We looked at a range of individual 
components and observed similar trends for each, but 
the selected variables may not cover the entirety of 
social status. This study used a homogenous popula-
tion, so the results may not be generalisable to other 
ethnic groups. We note that the genetic variants associ-
ated with BMI together explain only 1.5% of the varia-
tion in BMI, but collectively the variants provide a 
robust test, as reflected by the strong F statistic of the 
genetic risk score. The 69 genetic variants associated 
with BMI provided a stronger “instrument” than those 
used in previous mendelian randomisation studies that 
inferred a causal effect of higher BMI leading to lower 
vitamin D concentrations and higher risk of heart fail-
ure and markers of poor metabolic health.36 
37
Finally, height, BMI, and socioeconomic status are 
subtly stratified across the United Kingdom, with people 
living and working in the north of the country having 
lower socioeconomic status, higher BMI, and shorter 
stature, on average, than those in the south. If genetic 
variants are also subtly different between north and 
south, this could have confounded our results. However, 
several factors mean that this population stratification 
should not have caused false positive results. Firstly, we 
would not have expected to have seen differences 
between men and women (because gene allele frequen-
cies do not differ between the sexes). Secondly, we used 
both within UK genetic ancestry principal components 
and a second method that corrects for all levels of relat-
edness, and our results did not change.
Conclusion
In summary, using up to 119 000 participants from the 
UK Biobank, we provide evidence that high BMI and 
short stature, as estimated by genetics, are causally 
related to lower socioeconomic status. Further work is 
needed to understand the factors that lead to and from 
anthropometric traits and socioeconomic status.
