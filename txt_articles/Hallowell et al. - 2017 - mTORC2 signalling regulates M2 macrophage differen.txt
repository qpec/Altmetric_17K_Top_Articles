Alternatively activated macrophages (M2) have an important function in innate immune
responses to parasitic helminths, and emerging evidence also indicates these cells are
regulators of systemic metabolism. Here we show a critical role for mTORC2 signalling in the
generation of M2 macrophages. Abrogation of mTORC2 signalling in macrophages by
selective conditional deletion of the adaptor molecule Rictor inhibits the generation of
M2 macrophages while leaving the generation of classically activated macrophages (M1)
intact. Selective deletion of Rictor in macrophages prevents M2 differentiation and clearance
of a parasitic helminth infection in mice, and also abrogates the ability of mice to regulate
brown fat and maintain core body temperature. Our findings define a role for mTORC2 in
macrophages in integrating signals from the immune microenvironment to promote innate
type 2 immunity, and also to integrate systemic metabolic and thermogenic responses.

 M
acrophages can be defined by their activation state as
classically activated macrophages (M1 macrophages) or
alternatively activated macrophages (M2 macrophages).
Using this heuristic convention, the generation of M1 macro-
phages is the result of stimulation with IFNg and lipopolysac-
charide (LPS)1 and is associated with a Th1 environment. M1
macrophages have an important function in killing intracellular
pathogens1,2 and produce IL-12, IL-6, TNF and iNOS3. On the
other hand, M2 macrophage generation results from stimulation
with IL-4 (refs 4,5) or IL-13 (refs 4,6) and is associated with a Th2
environment1,4. M2 macrophages have been implicated in
fighting
parasitic
infections1,7
and
attenuating
excessive
inflammation8, while contributing to tissue remodelling and
repair2,9. Additionally, M2 macrophages have a central role in
regulating
glucose
tolerance
and
systemic
metabolism10,11.
Through the release of IL-10, M2 macrophages maintain
insulin
sensitivity
in
adipocytes12,13
and
sustain
adaptive
thermogenesis by inducing thermogenic gene expression in the
adipose tissue of mice exposed to cold14. Although we use
conventional M1 and M2 definitions, we also specify the context
in which the macrophages are polarized and activated, as per the
latest nomenclature guidelelines15.
Evidence indicates that macrophages have phenotypic plasti-
city depending on their environment1,16 and that changes in
phenotype are accompanied by alterations in metabolism17.
mTOR (the mechanistic target of rapamycin) is a serine/
threonine
kinase
that
belongs
to
the
phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase-related
kinase
protein
family18.
In
yeast
and
mammalian cells, TOR integrates environmental cues, including
growth factors and nutrient or energy availability to direct cell
growth19,20. mTOR signals via two complexes, TOR complex
1 (mTORC1) and TOR complex 2 (mTORC2), and each complex
has specific functions in cell signalling and metabolism21–24.
Studies have shown that mTOR regulates the differentiation
of T cells25,26, with mTORC1 and mTORC2 activity being
required for the differentiation of T cells into Th1/Th17 and
Th2 cells, respectively25,26.
A role for mTOR signalling in macrophage activation,
differentiation and function seems equally likely. Evidence
indicates that mTOR and its related pathways can regulate
the
function
of
dendritic
cells27–32,
monocytes32
and
macrophages33,34. Although the selective deletion of mTORC1
signalling inhibits Th1 differentiation of T cells, the inhibition of
mTORC1
in
macrophages
seems
to
enhance
expression
of M1-associated cytokines32,35. The precise role of mTORC2
signalling in macrophage differentiation and function is yet to be
defined. To this end, we generated mice in which the mTORC2
adaptor protein Rictor is genetically deleted in macrophages
(termed Rictor LysM mice). Our data indicate a selective role for
mTORC2 signalling in the generation of M2 macrophages.
Furthermore, our in vivo findings not only define a role
for mTORC2 in integrating external cues to guide macrophage
M2 differentiation and function but also substantiate the critical
role
of
M2
macrophages
in
controlling
thermogenesis
and maintaining core body temperature.
Results
Generation of mTOR and Rictor null macrophages. While
a number of studies have used the pharmacologic inhibitor
rapamycin to examine the role of mTORC1 on M1 function36,37
(although rapamycin in high doses or for prolonged periods can
also inhibit mTORC2 as well) and others have examined the
consequence of hyper-active mTORC1 activity by deleting TSC1
and TSC2 on macrophage differentiation and function34,38,39, the
role of mTORC2 in regulating macrophage activation has yet to
be determined. To this end, we crossed Rictor flox mice with
mice that express Cre under the control of the lysozyme
(LysM-Cre) promoter. As a control, and for comparisons to
delineate the unique role of mTORC2 signalling, we also crossed
mTOR floxed mice with the LysM-Cre mice in order to
genetically ablate both mTORC1 and mTORC2 signalling in
macrophages.
First, to determine if mTOR and Rictor were efficiently
genetically
deleted
in
macrophages,
bone
marrow-derived
macrophages (BMDM) were analysed for the synthesis of mTOR
and Rictor protein using immunostained western blots. Rictor
and mTOR were not detectable in lysates from the Rictor LysM
and mTOR LysM macrophages, respectively (Fig. 1a,b). The
selective deletion of mTOR or Rictor in macrophages did not
have a substantial effect on the overall cellularity of the lungs,
liver, skin or spleen (Supplementary Fig. 1a). Although the total
baseline cellularity in the bone marrow of Wt LysM, mTOR LysM
and Rictor LysM mice were similar, upon in vitro culture with
MCSF1 for 7 days, there was a decrease in the yield of
macrophages from the mTOR LysM bone marrow (Supple-
mentary Fig. 1b). To test for possible cellular effects caused by
lysozyme expression in other cell types40, we compared the
numbers of alveolar macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells and
interstitial macrophages in the lungs. There were no strain-
associated differences in the total numbers or percentages of these
cells (Supplementary Fig. 1c). Thus, prior to any in vivo
activation,
the
tissue
macrophages,
dendritic
cells
and
neutrophils were equivalent in number between the Wt LysM,
mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice.
Next, we sought to confirm the biochemical and functional
consequences of deleting Rictor and mTOR in BMDM. mTORC1
activity of LPS-stimulated cells was interrogated by examining
the phosphorylation status of S6 and 4-EBP1, targets of
mTORC1
(Fig.
1d).
mTORC2
activity
was
assessed
in
IL-4-treated cells by measuring the phosphorylation of Akt at
serine 473. As a control, we measured the phosphorylation of Akt
at Threonine 308, which is not mTORC2 dependent. As
predicted, the deletion of mTOR significantly reduced the
phosphorylation of S6, 4EBP-1 and Akt. Alternatively, the
deletion of Rictor selectively mitigated Akt phosphorylation of
serine 473 while the level of phosphorylation of S6 was near that
of the control (Fig. 1d). In addition, we demonstrate decreased
mTORC2 activation over time in the mTOR and Rictor
LysM null macrophages as measured by phosphorylation of
AKT-S473 as well as the downstream target of Akt activation,
P-Foxo (Fig. 1e). Thus the mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice
harbour macrophages that are selectively defective in carrying
out the biochemical functions of mTORC1/mTORC2 and
mTORC2, respectively.
mTORC2 is not required for M1 macrophage differentiation.
Pharmacologic inhibition of mTORC1 promotes the increased
expression of M1 cytokine expression36. Because it is possible that
mTORC2 was part of the mechanism that resulted in enhanced
M1 activation after blocking mTORC1, we tested the role of
mTORC2 activity on M1 cytokine expression. BMDM were
skewed to an M1 phenotype with LPS, LPS/IFNg or LPS/ATP and
the expression of M1 markers were measured by RT-PCR or
ELISA. Rictor LysM BMDM had similar expression levels of the
M1-associated genes/markers IL-12a, IL-6, RANTES and TNF as
that observed in Wt LysM BMDM (Fig. 2a). Rictor LysM BMDM
also produced similar levels of TNF, IL-6 and IL-1b protein as
measured by ELISA (Fig. 2b–d). These data suggest that
mTORC2
signalling
does
not
play
a
significant
role
in
regulating M1 activation and function.

 Next we wanted to determine if mTORC2 signalling played
a role in the differentiation and function of M2 macrophages.
To this end, BMDM were M2 polarized with IL-4 and the
expression of canonical M2 markers were measured by RT-PCR.
Rictor LysM BMDM had significantly lower expression of
Ym1 (Chil3), Fizz1 (Retnla) and Arg1 (Fig. 3a) than the
M2-polarized BMDM from the control LysM mice. Consistent
with these expression results, arginase enzymatic activity was
significantly lower in Rictor LysM BMDM (Fig. 3b) as was
the steady state levels of Arginase-1 protein (Fig. 3c). The
diminished M2 activation in the Rictor LysM mice was not due
to decreased expression of the IL-4 receptor, as there was
no significant difference in the cell-surface expression between
Wt LysM and Rictor LysM BMDM (Fig. 3d). Additionally,
we observed significantly decreased levels of expression of
Arg1, Ym1 and Mrc1 (mannose receptor 1, CD206) by mTOR
LysM BMDM indicating that M2 macrophage generation occurs
in an mTOR-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 2.)
Next we wanted to determine the mechanism by which
mTORC2 regulates M2 differentiation. Previous studies have
demonstrated that the deletion of Rictor in T cells inhibits Th2
differentiation in part by mitigating STAT6 phosphorylation26.
The most studied inducer of M2 differentiation of macrophages is
IL-4-induced STAT6 phosphorylation41. Thus, we sought to
determine the effect of Rictor deletion on IL-4-mediated STAT6
phosphorylation in macrophages. BMDM were stimulated with

 IL-4 and the phosphorylation status of STAT6 was determined
by western blotting (Fig. 3d). While IL-4 strongly induced
phosphorylation of STAT6 in the control LysM macrophages,
deletion of Rictor resulted in a significantly decreased level
of STAT6 phosphorylation, indicating that the defect observed
in the M2 differentiation of Rictor LysM macrophages was due to
altered IL-4R signal transduction.
In T cells, the defect in STAT6 phosphorylation was shown to
coincide with increased expression of suppressor of cytokine
signalling 5 (SOCS5)26. Based on these data we sought to
determine
whether
SOCS
family
members
contributed
to
the observed decrease in STAT6 phosphorylation in Rictor
LysM macrophages. BMDM were stimulated with IL-4 and
western blot analysis was performed to estimate the levels
of SOCS3 (Fig. 3e), SOCS1 (Fig. 3f) and SOCS5 (Fig. 3g).
The expression of SOCS3 was unchanged and equivalent
between the control LysM and Rictor LysM macrophages.
However, both SOCS1 and SOCS5 had significantly increased
expression
in
Rictor
LysM
macrophages,
with
SOCS5
being expressed regardless of stimulation with IL-4 and SOCS1
being
strongly
upregulated
upon
IL-4
stimulation.
These
data indicate that mTORC2 functions as an inhibitor of the
synthesis
of
both
SOCS1
and
SOCS5
in
macrophages,
allowing
for
phosphorylation
of
STAT6,
which
drives
M2 macrophage differentiation. Taken together these data
suggest that mTORC2 plays a unique role in promoting M2,
but not M1 macrophages.
mTORC2 signalling and the response to hookworm infection.
We wanted to determine the role of mTORC2 signalling in
promoting M2-mediated immune responses in vivo. M2 macro-
phages have been shown to play a critical role in host defenses
against parasitic helminths42,43 and the rodent hookworm
Nippostrongylus brasiliensis has been extensively characterized
for its ability to induce a strongly polarized Th2 immune
response44 and robust generation of M2 macrophages in the
lungs during the early, tissue migratory stage of the infection. In
order to analyse the role of mTORC2 signalling in the generation
of M2 macrophages following primary exposure to the parasite,
control LysM, mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice were infected
with 400 stage 3 N. brasiliensis larvae (L3) and 5 days later
the
lungs
were
harvested
and
RNA
was
analysed
for
M2-associated gene expression (Fig. 4a–c). The lungs from
infected
mTOR
LysM
and
Rictor
LysM
mice
displayed
significantly reduced expression of Arg1, Fizz1 and Ym1 when
compared to Wt LysM mice. Flow cytometry of whole lungs
indicated similar percentages of total alveolar and interstitial
macrophages after primary infection indicating that decreased
levels of M2 markers were not due to decreased lung cellularity
(Supplementary Fig. 3). There were no significant differences in
adult worm burden in the small intestine indicating that all mice
did in fact receive equivalent infections of the helminth (Fig. 4b).
In addition, the magnitude and dynamics of parasite egg
production was not significantly different between groups
(Fig. 4c) indicating that M2 macrophages are not playing a role
in blocking larval development in the lungs or in accelerating the
expulsion of adult hookworms from the intestine during a
primary infection. These data support an important role for
TORC2 signalling in the specific generation of M2 macrophages
in vivo.
M2 macrophages have been reported to be important for
the resolution of inflammation and promoting repair after lung
injury45.Using measures of pulmonary function, we sought
to determine whether mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice had
increased lung damage following primary infection. Mice were

 exposed to 400 infective stage L3 N. brasiliensis and 21 days later
their lungs were subjected to pulmonary function testing.
No significant differences were observed between Wt LysM,
mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice when comparing diffusion
capacity, lung compliance or lung resistance (Supplementary
Fig. 4). These data do not support a role for M2 macrophages in
the resolution of lung injury following primary hookworm
infection.
In secondary hookworm infection, M2 macrophages have
been shown to surround and kill hookworm larvae in the
lungs, subsequently reducing the number of N. brasiliensis
larvae that reach the gut43. Based on these data, we sought to
determine whether Rictor LysM mice would be able to mount
an effective secondary response to hookworm infection. In
this model, adult worms are expelled from the intestines such
that the mice are parasite-free by day 11. Wt LysM, mTOR
LysM and Rictor LysM mice received a primary subcutaneous
infection as outlined above, and then 4 weeks later were given
a secondary intravenous infection of 1000 L3 N. brasiliensis
larvae (to avoid larval trapping in the skin). Two days
following secondary infection, the lungs were harvested, fixed
and histology was performed. Lungs of Wt LysM mice contained
numerous
eosinophilic
granulomas,
with
entrapped
larvae
and few free larvae (Fig. 4d). In contrast, the lungs from
mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice contained free larvae in
the airways with little evidence of granuloma formation (Fig. 4d).
These
data
indicate
that

mTORC2 signalling and adaptive thermogenesis. It has become
increasingly clear that immune cells play an important role
in regulating systemic metabolism46–49. Along these lines, it
has recently been demonstrated that IL-4-induced M2 activation
of macrophages is required for adaptive thermogenesis in mice14.
Exposure to cold promotes M2 macrophage differentiation
that subsequently secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic
gene expression in brown adipose tissue (BAT) and lipolysis in
white adipose tissue (WAT)14. In light of our data demonstrating
defective M2 macrophage differentiation in vitro and in vivo
in the absence of Rictor, we wanted to determine if mTORC2
signalling in macrophages was required to regulate thermogenesis
in vivo. To accomplish this, we analysed the expression of
M2 markers on BAT- and WAT-derived macrophages in mice
housed at 30 �C (thermoneutrality) or after an acute challenge
at 4 �C. Consistent with previous findings, there was an increase
in the expression of Arg1 and Mrc1 in both BAT and WAT of
wild type mice exposed to 4 �C (Fig. 5a,b). In contrast, mTOR
LysM and Rictor LysM mice failed to demonstrate an increase in
M2 activation of BAT and WAT macrophages when exposed to
the cold environment, as demonstrated by the lack of expression
of Arg1 and Mrc1. Brown fat macrophages also failed to express
the M1-associated genes CD274, NOS2 and TNF, indicating
that brown fat macrophages from mTOR LysM and Rictor
LysM are not preferentially becoming M1 in the absence of
M2 gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 5). Regardless of
genotype, all mice demonstrated an increase in the percentage
of macrophages
in the brown fat following 6 h at
4 �C
(Supplementary Fig. 6). This increase appeared to be due to
increased influx from the periphery since the expression of the

When we analysed the surface expression of the M2 surface
markers CD301 (the C-type lection family member CLEC10A)
and CD206 (mannose receptor) by flow cytometry, we observed
a significant reduction in their expression on BAT- and

 To investigate the effect of defective M2 macrophage genera-
tion
on
cold-induced
thermogenesis
in
intact
animals,
we challenged Wt LysM, mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM
mice to 4 �C. Unlike the control LysM mice, mTOR LysM and
Rictor LysM mice exhibited a drop in core body temperature
when exposed to 4 �C (Fig. 6a). In addition, the mTOR LysM
and Rictor LysM mice lost significantly less weight over the
6-h cold challenge, indicating a defective thermogenic response
(Supplementary Fig. 8). Wt LysM mice responded to the
decrease in temperature by expressing the thermogenic genes
Ppargc1a and Ucp1 and the B-oxidation genes Acox1 and Acsl1
in BAT (Fig. 6b,c)50,51. The induction of thermogenic genes by
BAT was significantly abrogated in mTOR LysM and Rictor
LysM
mice.
We
also
observed
abrogated
expression
of
thermogenic genes by WAT from mTOR LysM and Rictor
LysM animals (Supplementary Fig. 9). These data indicate that
differentiation of BAT- and WAT-resident macrophages to M2 is
required for the thermogenic response to cold temperatures.
It has recently been demonstrated that thermogenic gene
induction is dependent upon the production of catecholamines by
BAT-resident M2 macrophages14. Therefore, we sought to
determine if the observed defect in adaptive thermogenesis by
mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice was due to a lack of
catecholamine production by BAT-resident macrophages. After
mTOR LysM, Rictor LysM and control mice were cold challenged
at 4 �C for 6 h, brown fat was isolated and the concentration
of noradrenaline was measured. In contrast to the control
LysM mice that showed no significant change in noradrenaline
whereas the mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice had a significant
reduction
in
noradrenaline
content
when
cold
challenged
indicating that the defective thermogenic response in these
mice may be due to insufficient catecholamine production by
BAT-resident macrophages (Fig. 6d).
Catecholamines released by M2 macrophages in the WAT bind
the
b-adrenergic
receptor
on
adipocytes
and
induce
the
expression of tyrosine hydroxylase. This induces lipolysis of
WAT and results in the release of free fatty acids into the blood
stream14. Since we observed decreased catecholamine production
in both mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice we sought to
determine if this resulted in defective lipolysis. In order
to confirm equivalent expression of the b-adrenergic receptor
on adipocytes, WAT was isolated and western blot was performed
for
the
b-adrenergic
receptor
(Supplementary
Fig.
10).

 not significantly different between Wt LysM, mTOR LysM
and Rictor LysM mice. In order to examine lipolysis we exposed
Wt LysM,
mTOR
LysM and
Rictor LysM
mice to
6-h
4 �C challenge, isolated white fat and performed flow cytometry
for tyrosine hydroxylase (Supplementary Fig. 11a). Wt LysM mice
had a significant increase in the MFI of tyrosine hydroxylase
when challenged at 4 �C for 6 h; however both mTOR LysM and
Rictor LysM mice demonstrated no increase in the MFI of
tyrosine hydroxylase when cold challenged. In addition, when
we measured serum-free fatty acids after 6-h cold challenge
mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM had significantly less serum FFAs
when
compared
to
Wt
LysM
following
cold
challenge
(Supplementary
Fig.
11b).
Consistent
with
this
finding,
histology revealed that mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice had
exhausted
their
lipid
stores
in
their
BAT
(Fig.
6e
and
Supplementary Fig. 12) indicating that the observed defective
adaptive thermogenesis was a direct consequence of insufficient
free fatty acid mobilization due to reduced catecholamine
production by WAT-resident M2 macrophages.
These data led us to investigate whether the b-adrenergic
receptor agonist CL-316243 could rescue the observed defect
in thermogenesis in mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice. Mice
were given a single injection of CL-316243 and 30 min later
challenged at 4 �C for 6 h. mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM
mice that received CL-316243 maintained body temperature
similar to Wt LysM whereas mice that received vehicle lost
significantly more body temperature (Fig. 7a). In addition, mice
that received CL-316243 lost more body weight than mice
that received vehicle, indicating that the thermogenic response
was functional (Fig. 7b). mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM
mice receiving vehicle had significantly abrogated expression
of thermogenic genes in WAT; however, mice provided with
CL-316243 expressed thermogenic genes to similar levels as
Wt LysM mice (Fig. 7c). Treatment with CL-316243 also returned
serum FFA levels to those seen in Wt LysM mice (Fig. 7d).
These data indicate that the defect in thermogenesis observed
in mTOR LysM and Rictor LysM mice is due to defective
M2
macrophage
generation
that
in
turn
abrogates
the
b-adrenergic response. Overall, our data support an essential
role for mTORC2 signalling in the in vivo differentiation of
M2 macrophages and indicate that mTOR signalling is necessary
for proper adaptive thermogenesis.
Discussion
Macrophages have traditionally been classified as either classically
activated (M1) or alternatively activated (M2) depending upon
their
stimulatory
environment5,52,53.
However,
the
precise
mechanism
by
which
macrophages
differentiate
into
the
M1 and M2 phenotypes remains incompletely understood. We
have used a novel Rictor LysM mouse model to demonstrate
for the first time that mTORC2 regulates the differentiation
and key functional abilities of M2 macrophages. Further, we
provide evidence that mTORC2 has no demonstrable effect on

 the course of M1 differentiation. Our data clearly demonstrate a
critical
role
for
mTORC2
in
regulating
M2
macrophage
differentiation in vitro and in vivo in response to both infection
and systemic thermogenic signals. We propose that mTORC2
integrates multiple signals from the immune microenvironment
to guide this differentiation. Along these lines we demonstrate
that the decrease in IL-4 mediated signalling in Rictor LysM null
macrophages is associated with an increase in the inhibitors
SOCS1 and SOCS5. While this represents one mechanism by
which mTORC2 specifically regulates macrophage differentiation,
given the multitude of signalling pathways controlled by mTOR
we suspect that other mechanisms are likely involved as well.
While the LysM-Cre model has been extensively employed to
examine macrophage function in vivo14,34,38, it is important to
note that LysM is also upregulated in neutrophils and dendritic
cells during inflammation and we cannot exclude the possibility
that deletion of mTORC2 in these cells could have had some
effect on the in vivo phenotypes presented here.
Previous studies have examined the role of TSC1 in regulating
macrophage differentiation and function. Deleting TSC1 in
macrophages using LysM-Cre leads to hyperactive mTORC1
activity
and
cells
that
increase
M1-associated
cytokine
production and are refractory to IL-4-induced M2 macrophage
differentiation34.
Subsequently
it
was
demonstrated
that
TSC1 inhibits M1 macrophage polarization in an mTORC1-
independent
fashion
while
promoting
M2
properties
in
an
mTOR-dependent
CCAAT/enhancer-binding
protein-b
pathway38. In addition, mTORC1 signalling has been shown to
influence Ac-CoA synthesis and histone acetylation of several M2
genes54. These reports suggest that, while mTORC2 regulates M2
macrophage differentiation in vitro and in vivo, mTORC1
signalling is not completely dispensable for expression of a
number of genes critical for M2 function.
There is evidence that mTOR and its related pathways regulate
the production of cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-10 in dendritic
cells27–30,32, cytokine production of macrophages challenged by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis33, and differentiation of T cells26,55.
T cells lacking both mTORC1 and MTORC2 activity are unable
to develop into Th1, Th2 or Th17 cells; rather, they become
CD4 þ T regulatory cells25. CD4 þT cells lacking only mTORC1
activity are unable to become Th1 or Th17 cells; however, they
are capable of becoming Th2 cells25. T cells lacking mTORC2
activity are unable to become Th2 cells, while maintaining
their
ability
to
develop
into
Th1
or
Th17
cells26.
We
have demonstrated that mTORC2 regulates M2 differentiation
and function in a way that is analogous to its role in
Th2 differentiation. By providing a gate for both Th2 (ref. 26)
and M2 differentiation, mTORC2 is strategically positioned
to be the primary regulator of macrophage polarization in
settings where Th2-mediated inflammation is dominant such as
parasitic helminth infections, allergic responses, and tissue repair
and wound healing56,57.
In addition to their role as primary effectors of the innate
immune response, macrophages, and in particular, M2 macro-
phages, have been shown to play an integral role in adaptive
thermogenesis14. Nguyen et al. have demonstrated that exposure
to cold results in an upregulation of BAT M2 macrophages, and
that these macrophages induce the expression of thermogenic
genes within brown fat14. In their model, mice deficient in
IL-4/IL-13 signalling were unable to upregulate adipose tissue
M2 macrophages and demonstrated impaired thermoregulation
during cold exposure14. Similarly, we have found that exposure to
cold induces the expression of BAT M2 macrophages, and that
this expression is severely impaired in the Rictor LysM and
mTOR
LysM
mice
and
is
associated
with
impaired
thermoregulation. The mice used in our study had no defect in
IL-4/IL-13 signalling, thus supporting the idea that adaptive
thermogenesis is specifically dependent upon fully functional
M2 macrophages. The observation that selectively deleting
mTORC2 activity in macrophages results in such profound
defects in the ability of BAT and WAT to defend their core
body temperature serves to underscore the critical role of
M2
macrophages
and
mTORC2
signalling
in
regulating
systemic thermogenesis and as a critical component of an
evolutionarily conserved environmental sensing system.
Overall
our
data
demonstrate
that
mTORC2
regulates
M2
macrophage
differentiation
and
function,
while
being
dispensable for M1 differentiation. Our data identify mTORC2
as a critical sensor that enables M2 macrophages to respond
to helminth infection as well as regulated systemic metabolism.
M2 macrophages play a key role in the elimination of various
infections, and they have been implicated in diseases involving
the lungs1,7,58,59, heart1,60,61, central nervous system62,63, and in
the formation of atherosclerotic plaques64,65. As such our findings
have broad implications for both infectious and non-infectious
disease. Indeed, by integrating environmental cues, mTORC2
signalling connects the diverse role of M2 macrophages in
regulating infection and thermogenesis. As a result, various steps
in the mTORC2 signalling pathway may ultimately prove to be
novel therapeutic targets for altering the course of systemic
disease.
Methods
Mice. All experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use
Committee of Johns Hopkins University and mice were maintained in accordance
with their guidelines. C57BL/6 Wt LysM mice, Rictor flox mice and mTOR flox
mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). All experiments
were conducted using either 8-week-old female or male mice for a given
experiment.
Generation of BMDMs. Macrophage precursors were obtained from the bone
marrow of each individual mouse line and differentiated on untreated polystyrene
Petri dishes (Fisher Scientific, USA) in 10 ml of Roswell Park Memorial Institute
media (RPMI) supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM
L-glutamine (cell media) plus 20% L929-conditioned media containing M-CSF66.
The cells were incubated at 37 �C with 5% CO2. On day 4, the cell media and any
non-adherent cells were removed; adherent cells were washed with PBS before the
addition of 10 ml of fresh cell media plus 20% L929 media. On day 7, macrophages
were washed with PBS and then incubated with 10 ml of Cellstripper (Mediatech,
Manassas, VA) for 45 min prior to gentle pipette agitation. Cell solutions were spun
down and suspended in RPMI þ 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mM
L-glutamine. For skewing, bone marrow macrophages were skewed to M1 with
IFNg (500 U ml � 1) or to M2 with IL-4 (20 ng ml � 1) for 48 h.
Cell stimulation. BMDMs were plated in 24-well plates at a concentration of 1
million cells per well or in 96-well plates at a concentration of 250 K cells/well and
allowed to adhere overnight in cell media. The following day, the cell media was
removed and adherent cells were washed with PBS before the addition of cell media
lacking FBS. Cells were then stimulated with IL-4 (20 ng ml � 1) (Peprotech),
LPS (50 ng ml � 1) (Sigma) or IFNg (500 U ml � 1) (Sigma) for 24 h. Supernatant
was collected and stored at � 80 degrees for future ELISA, arginase assay and
nitrite assay experiments. Cells were processed for RNA extraction as detailed
below.
RNA extraction and quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Total cell RNA was
extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and reversed transcribed
by Superscript as per the manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR was
performed on an Applied Biosystems 7300 PCR machine using Applied Biosystems
reagents (Carlsbad, CA) and normalized to 18s rRNA. Values were calculated
using the delta Ct method in reference to unstimulated WT LysM samples for
each primer. All primers and probe sets used were purchased from Applied
Biosystems (Carlsbad, CA). IL12a (Mm00434165), IL6 (Mm00446190),

and analysed with Microplate Manager III (Bio-Rad) software. ELISA kits for
TNF were from eBioscience (San Diego, CA). Arginase activity in culture
supernatants was measured using a QuantiChrom arginase assay kit according to
the manufacturer’s specifications (DARG-200, BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA).
Serum FFA ELISA kit was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK).
Thermogenesis experiments. For cold challenge experiments mice were
individually housed in cages that had been pre-chilled at 4 �C. Core body
temperature was monitored hourly by rectal temperature probe. For thermo-
neutrality experiments, mice were adapted to 30 �C for 3 weeks before experi-
mentation. Tissues were collected at the end of a 6-h cold challenge, and processed
for RNA and norepinephrine analysis.
FACS analysis. Adipose tissues were minced and digested with collagenase
I (3 mg ml � 1, Gibco) for 45 min at 37 �C in a shaker. The digested cell suspension
was centrifuged at 1,600 r.p.m. for 5 min to separate stromal-vascular fraction from
adipocytes. Pelleted cells were re-suspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing
5% FBS and 1% gluatamine) and passed through a 40 mm strainer to remove large
cellular debris. FACS analysis was performed on a BD FACS Caliber or
FACS Celesta. Antibodies used are listed in Supplementary Fig. 13. Lung
FACS gating strategy is displayed in Supplementary Fig. 14.
Western blotting. Cells were plated at a concentration of 3 million cells per 6-well
plate and incubated overnight in cell media without FBS. The following day, cells
were stimulated with LPS or IL-4 as outlined above. Cell pellets were lysed and
20 mg of lysate was fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose.
Membranes were then blocked with 5% bovine serum albumin, washed, and
incubated with primary antibodies (1:2,000) (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers,
MA) overnight at 4 �C. Membranes were then washed and incubated for 1 h with
anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase linked secondary antibody (1:5,000)
(ECL, Buckinhamshire, UK) prior to developing with a chemiluminescent system
(Amersham, Buckinhamshire, UK). Original immunoblots are shown in
Supplementary Fig. 15.
Catecholamine measurement. Catecholamines (LDN Labor Diagnostika Nord
GmbH & Co) were quantified in duplicate as per the manufacturer’s protocols.
Tissues were homogenized in homogenization buffer (0.01 N HCL, 0.1 mm EDTA,
4 mm NA2S2O5) and cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation. The cleared
homogenates were collected and stored at � 80 �C before quantification. All
samples were normalized to total tissue protein concentration.
N. brasiliensis infection. Maintenance and enumeration of N. brasiliensis was
performed as previously described67. Briefly, propagation of N. brasiliensis was
performed by subcutaneous injection of mice with L3 larvae and isolation of faeces
on days 7–10. Eggs of N. brasiliensis were cultured on granulated charcoal and
sphagnum moss in order to isolate larvae. To initiate infection, mice were injected
subcutaneously at the nape of the neck with 400 infective L3 stage larvae suspended
in 200 ml of PBS. Faeces of infected mice were isolated on days 5–11, softened in
water and counted.
Diffusion factor for carbon monoxide measurement. To assess overall
functional changes in the lungs following helminth-induced injury, measurement
of the diffusion factor for carbon monoxide (DFCO) was performed as previously
described68. Briefly, mice were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine
(100 mg kg � 1)/xylazine (15 mg kg � 1) via intraperitoneal injection. Once sedated,
a tracheostomy was performed, and an 18-gauge cannula was inserted. Lungs were
quickly inflated with a 0.8 ml gas mixture (0.5% neon, 1% CO and balance air), and
after a 9-s breath hold, the gas was quickly withdrawn from the lungs and diluted
to 2 ml with room air. The neon and CO concentrations in the diluted air were
measured by gas chromatography (INFICON, Model 3000A; Inficon Inc., East
Syracuse, NY) to calculate the DFCO.
Pulmonary mechanics measurements. After DFCO assessment, mice were
connected to a flexi-VentTM ventilator (Scireq, Montreal, QC, Canada) and
ventilated with a tidal volume of 0.2 ml of 100% oxygen at a rate of 150 Hz with
a positive end-expiratory pressure of 3 cm H2O. Mice were paralyzed with an i.p.
injection of succinylcholine (75 mg kg-1), subjected to deep inspiration at 30 cm
H2O for 5 s and returned to normal ventilation for 1 min. Baseline measurements
of respiratory system resistance (Rrs), compliance (Crs) and elastance (Ers) were
measured during a 2-s breath hold with a 2.5-Hz sinusoidal oscillation using the
single compartment69. The impedance of the respiratory system was also obtained
using a constant phase model to provide measurements of airway resistance (Raw),
tissue damping (G) and tissue elastance (H)70.
Statistical analysis. All experiments were performed in biological triplicate and
results represent the mean ± s.d. All experiments were replicated at least three
times. Statistical analysis was performed using either 1-way ANOVA followed by
Tukey’s test or a paired Student’s t-test; Po0.05 was considered statistically
significant.
