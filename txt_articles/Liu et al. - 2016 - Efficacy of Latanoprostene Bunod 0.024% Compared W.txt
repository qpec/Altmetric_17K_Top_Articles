� PURPOSE: To compare the diurnal and nocturnal ef-
fects of latanoprostene bunod 0.024% solution with
timolol maleate 0.5% solution on intraocular pressure
(IOP) and ocular perfusion pressure.
� DESIGN: Prospective, open-label randomized crossover
trial.
� METHODS: Twenty-five patients (aged 43–82 years)
with ocular hypertension or early primary open-angle
glaucoma were enrolled. Baseline IOP and blood pressure
were measured in a sleep laboratory every 2 hours in the
sitting and supine positions during the 16-hour diurnal/
wake period and in the supine position during the
8-hour nocturnal/sleep period. Subjects were randomly
assigned to bilateral treatments of latanoprostene bunod
at 8 PM or timolol at 8 AM and 8 PM. The second labo-
ratory recording occurred after the 4-week treatment.
Subjects were crossed over to the comparator treatment
for 4 weeks before the third laboratory recording. Mean
IOP and calculated ocular perfusion pressure were
compared for the diurnal and nocturnal periods.
� RESULTS: Twenty-one subjects completed the study.
Both treatments reduced diurnal sitting and supine IOP
compared to baseline by 2.3–3.9 mm Hg (all P <
.001) with no statistically significant difference between
the 2 treatments. Nocturnal IOP under latanoprostene
bunod treatment was 2.5 ± 3.1 mm Hg (mean ± SD)
less than baseline (P [ .002) and 2.3 ± 3.0 mm Hg
less than timolol treatment (P [ .004). Latanoprostene
bunod treatment resulted in greater diurnal sitting and su-
pine ocular perfusion pressures compared with baseline
(P £ .006) and greater nocturnal ocular perfusion pres-
sure compared with timolol treatment (P [ .010).
� CONCLUSIONS: During the nocturnal period, latano-
prostene bunod caused more IOP reduction and more
increase of ocular perfusion pressure than timolol.

OWERING INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE (IOP) MAY DELAY
the onset of glaucoma in ocular hypertensive
patients and slow the disease progression in patients
with existing glaucoma.1 Whereas the highest IOP in pa-
tients with ocular hypertension and primary open-angle
glaucoma frequently occur outside the diurnal/wake
period,2,3 currently available topical medications to treat
these patients have shown variable IOP-lowering efficacies
during the nocturnal/sleep period compared to their
diurnal efficacies.4–10 Prostaglandin analogues (including
latanoprost, travoprost, and bimatoprost) applied once
daily in the evening were shown to be effective in
lowering IOP for 24 hours, but with less nocturnal
efficacy
than
the
diurnal
efficacy.5–7,10
Timolol,
a
b-adrenergic antagonist, applied in gel form once daily in
the morning, had very limited IOP reduction during the
nocturnal period compared to its diurnal efficacy.5,8
Latanoprostene bunod (Bausch & Lomb, Bridgewater,
New Jersey, USA) is a new nitric oxide–donating prosta-
glandin F2a analogue with unique biological properties.
In situ, latanoprostene bunod is rapidly metabolized to lata-
noprost acid, a prostaglandin agonist, and butanediol
mononitrate, a nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety.11 Lata-
noprost acid (as the active moiety of latanoprost 0.005%
[Xalatan; Pfizer, New York, NY]) is reported to reduce
IOP by primarily increasing uveoscleral outflow.12,13 In
contrast, NO released from the NO-donating moiety of
latanoprostene bunod may lower IOP by increasing the
trabecular meshwork outflow.14–17 Nitric oxide is also a
biological messenger for other physiological functions,
including vasodilation and, on systemic administration,
the reduction of blood pressure.18
A recent report showed that latanoprostene bunod was
well tolerated and efficacious in lowering IOP in patients
with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hyperten-
sion.19 There was a dose-dependent reduction in diurnal
IOP over 28 days at concentrations of 0.006% to 0.04%,
reaching a maximum effect with the 0.024% and 0.04%

were observed with latanoprostene bunod 0.024% and
0.04% compared with latanoprost 0.005%.19 To date,
IOP-lowering efficacy of latanoprostene bunod in subjects
with ocular hypertension or primary open-angle glaucoma
has not been reported outside the office hours. Effects of
latanoprostene bunod on systemic blood pressure and
calculated ocular perfusion pressure (based on mean arte-
rial blood pressure and IOP) are also unknown outside
the office hours. The present study evaluated the 24-hour
effects of latanoprostene bunod 0.024%, which is consid-
ered the optimal IOP-lowering concentration during office
hours,19 on IOP and ocular perfusion pressure after 4 weeks
of once-daily treatment in patients with ocular hyperten-
sion or primary open-angle glaucoma. These effects were
compared with the treatment effects of timolol maleate
0.5% ophthalmic solution given twice daily for 4 weeks
in the same patients.
METHODS
THIS
RANDOMIZED
CROSSOVER
CLINICAL
TRIAL
(http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT01707381) adhered to
the Declaration of Helsinki for research involving human
subjects and was registered as a clinical trial. Study protocol
was approved prospectively by the University of California,
San
Diego’s
Institutional
Review
Board
of
Human
Research Protections Program and in accordance with
the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
The study was conducted from November 2012 through
December 2013. Study subjects were recruited consecu-
tively from patients with bilateral early-stage open-angle
glaucoma or ocular hypertension seen at the University’s
Hamilton Glaucoma Center with predefined inclusion
and exclusion criteria. Criteria for the diagnosis of early
glaucomatous changes and ocular hypertension have been
described previously.2,3 Patients with open-angle glaucoma
had abnormalities in optic discs or visual fields (or both).
Patients with ocular hypertension had normal optic discs
and visual fields. Eligible patients for this study were 40–
90 years old with untreated IOP of at least 22 mm Hg in
1 eye and not higher than 36 mm Hg in both eyes, deter-
mined using Goldmann tonometer (Haag-Streit, Mason,
Ohio, USA) during office hours. Subjects were fully informed
about this study, and informed consents were obtained.
Each subject’s medical history was reviewed. Candidates
who had previous glaucoma surgery in either eye, had a his-
tory of ocular trauma, or had a sleep disorder or irregular
sleep schedule were excluded. Each subject had an examina-
tion including slit-lamp biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, Gold-
mann applanation tonometry, and dilated funduscopy.
Individuals with ocular inflammation, narrow iridocorneal
angle, severe cardiovascular or diabetic condition, or use
of a medication that may interact with the safety or efficacy
of an NO-donating compound were excluded. Other
routine systemic medications used by the subjects were
documented, and enrolled subjects with a change of sys-
temic medication during the study period were excluded.
Either the enrolled subjects were untreated with glau-
coma medication or their glaucoma medications were
washed outfor4 weeks followed by a check of IOPeligibility.
A washout period of 4 weeks had been used for the previous
study of latanoprostene bunod and its dose–IOP response
relationship.19 Before the 24-hour laboratory recording, sub-
jects were instructed to maintain a daily 8-hour regular sleep
schedule for 1 week. Individual sleep schedule was verified
using a wrist monitor for light exposure and arm movements
(Actiwatch; Mini Mitter, Sunriver, Oregon, USA) and a
wake/sleep log. Subjects were asked to abstain from alcohol
for 3 days and regular coffee for 1 day before reporting to the
laboratory approximately at 2 PM. Laboratory conditions
and general experimental procedures have been described
previously.10 The 8-hour sleep time for each subject in the
laboratory was adjusted close to the recorded bedtime in pre-
vious week and this 8-hour period was referred to as the
nocturnal/sleep period. Clock times for the IOP measure-
ments were also individualized accordingly. Subjects were
encouraged to continue normal indoor activities in the lab-
oratory. Food and water were available, and meal times were
not regulated.
Measurements of IOP and blood pressure/heart rate were
taken by experienced researchers. Intraocular pressure was
measured using a calibrated pneumatonometer (Reichert,
Depew, New York, USA). Topical proparacaine 0.5%
was used as the local anesthetic. Every plot of IOP measure-
ment by the pneumatonometer was evaluated according to
commonly accepted standards.20 Blood pressure and heart
rate were measured immediately before the IOP measure-
ments using an automated arm monitor (Accutorr Plus;
Datascope, Montvale, New Jersey, USA). The cuff was
mounted over the brachial artery, level with the heart,
and removed after the measurement. Two readings were
taken and, if the systolic or diastolic pressure differed by
more than 5 mm Hg between the 2 readings, the third
reading was added. The average of 2–3 readings was
recorded for the systolic pressure, diastolic pressure, and
heart rate at each clock time point.
Before bedtime, measurements were taken every 2 hours
(eg, at 2 PM, 4 PM, 6 PM, and 8 PM). Subjects were
instructed to sit for 5 minutes before the measurements of
blood pressure/heart rate and IOP, and then lie in bed for
5 minutes before the supine measurements of blood pres-
sure/heart rate and IOP. Lights in individual sleep rooms
were turned off according to each individual’s sleep times
(between 9:30 PM and 11:30 PM). Supine measurements
only were taken first at 30 minutes after the lights were
turned off (eg, 10 PM) and every 2 hours later. Subjects
were awakened, if needed, and the measurements were
taken immediately. A dim room light was used to assist
with the measurements. Some sleep disturbance due to

 the measurement procedure was unavoidable. The distur-
bance may affect nocturnal blood pressure and IOP levels,
even though the influence on IOP was probably minor.21,22
However, we assumed that every 24-hour laboratory session
would be similarly affected for each individual. Room light-
ing was restored after the 8-hour nocturnal/sleep period,
and subjects were awakened. Actual sleep length for each
individual was not determined. Measurements of blood
pressure/heart rate and IOP were taken again first at 30 mi-
nutes after the lights were turned on (eg, at 6 AM) and
every 2 hours thereafter. Timings of the measurements
were documented using infrared camera recording.
After baseline 24-hour sleep laboratory data were
collected, subjects were randomly assigned to receive lata-
noprostene bunod 0.024% ophthalmic solution in both
eyes once daily at approximately 8 PM or timolol maleate
0.5% ophthalmic solution twice daily at approximately 8
AM and 8 PM. Test agents were provided by Bausch &
Lomb (Bridgewater, New Jersey, USA). The first treatment
period lasted for 4 weeks before the second 24-hour sleep
laboratory recording. Subjects were then crossed over to
the alternate therapy for 4 weeks before the third 24-hour
sleep laboratory recording. During the second and third
laboratory recordings, subjects self-administered the test
agent under supervision.
Per the study protocol, IOP data from 1 eligible eye of
each subject were used for data analyses. If both eyes
were eligible, the eye with a higher baseline IOP (Gold-
mann tonometer) prior to the first 24-hour laboratory
recording was chosen for analysis. The right eye was chosen
if both eyes had the same IOP value. Mean arterial blood
pressure was calculated as the diastolic pressure plus one
third of the difference between the systolic and the dia-
stolic pressures. Ocular perfusion pressure in the sitting
and supine body positions were calculated, using formulas
based on the mean arterial blood pressure and IOP,
adjusted for the height of the eye over the heart23–27:
Sitting ocular perfusion pressure ¼ 95/140 3 mean arte-
rial blood pressure � IOP
Supine ocular perfusion pressure ¼ 115/130 3 mean
arterial blood pressure � IOP
Means of IOP, mean arterial blood pressure, ocular perfu-
sion pressure, and heart rate were calculated for the
16-hour diurnal/wake period (8 readings) and the 8-hour
nocturnal/sleep period (4 readings). For data presentation,
laboratory data were aligned as if each subject had a
nocturnal/sleep period from 9:30 PM to 5:30 AM. Statisti-
cal comparisons of study parameters were performed among
the baseline, the latanoprostene bunod treatment, and the
timolol treatment using the 1-way repeated-measures anal-
ysis of variance.5,8 The criterion for statistical significance
was P < .05. Post hoc Bonferroni t test was used for all 3
possible paired comparisons. Normal distribution of test
data was confirmed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Comparison of IOP at a single clock time point was not
performed because its value in assessing IOP-lowering ther-
apy is limited.28
Subjects were instructed to report significant or unusual
ocular and systemic reactions to the test agents during the
study period. An eye examination was performed after each
24-hour laboratory recording and when adverse events of
test agent had occurred. The severity of an adverse event
was evaluated by a glaucoma specialist and could lead to pa-
tient withdrawal from the study.
RESULTS
TWENTY-FIVE PATIENTS, 18 FEMALE AND 7 MALE, WITH AN
age of 60.3 6 10.6 years (mean 6 standard deviation;
range, 43–82 years) were enrolled. There were 20 white
(4 Hispanic ethnicity), 4 black, and 1 American Indian
patients. Twenty-one patients had a diagnosis of ocular
hypertension and 4 patients had primary open-angle glau-
coma. Nineteen patients were not using any glaucoma
medication at enrollment. Six patients were being treated
with a glaucoma medication(s) at enrollment: 4 with lata-
noprost, 1 with bimatoprost, and 1 with latanoprost and
timolol. Treated patients underwent 4-week washout.
The mean of the last office-hour Goldmann IOP reading
before the first laboratory recording was 23.2 6 1.6 mm
Hg (range, 21–28 mm Hg) for all the enrolled subjects un-
der no glaucoma medication. The mean central corneal
thickness was 556.3 6 27.9 mm (range, 511–598 mm).
The first (baseline) 24-hour laboratory recordings were
obtained from all 25 enrolled subjects, but only 21 subjects

One subject who was under the treatment with latanopros-
tene bunod missed the scheduled second 24-hour labora-

recording
and
was
withdrawn
administratively.
Three subjects withdrew from the study before the second
laboratory recordings; 2 subjects had significant brady-
cardia under the timolol treatment and 1 subject had

under
the
latanoprostene
bunod treatment. The recorded adverse events from all
enrolled subjects during the study period are summarized
in Table 1.
Figure 1 shows the 24-hour profiles of habitual IOP,
sitting during the diurnal/wake period and supine during
the nocturnal/sleep period, for the 21 subjects who
completed the study. Coincidently with postural changes,
IOP increased during the transition from the diurnal to
the nocturnal period and IOP decreased during the transi-
tion from the nocturnal to the diurnal period. Mean IOP
under the latanoprostene bunod treatment was consistently
observed to be the lowest among the 3 experimental condi-
tions during the 16-hour diurnal period. During the 8-hour
nocturnal period, mean baseline IOP and mean IOP under
the timolol treatment were similar. In contrast, mean IOP
under the latanoprostene bunod treatment was notably
lower than the baseline IOP as well as IOP under the
timolol treatment. Figure 2 presents the 24-hour supine
IOP profiles for the baseline, the latanoprostene bunod
treatment, and the timolol treatment. For supine IOP dur-
ing the diurnal period, IOP under the latanoprostene
bunod treatment was also the lowest among the 3 experi-
mental conditions. Profiles of 24-hour ocular perfusion
pressure for the habitual body positions and for the supine
position are presented as Figures 3 and 4, respectively. For
most time points, ocular perfusion pressures after the
latanoprostene bunod treatment were the highest.
Table 2 summarizes IOP, mean arterial blood pressure,
ocular perfusion pressure, and heart rate under the 3 exper-
imental conditions. During the diurnal/wake period, both
sitting and supine IOP levels under either test agent treat-
ment were significantly lower than the baselines in the
range of 2.3–3.9 mm Hg (P < .001). However, the
1.1–1.2 mm Hg IOP difference between the 2 treatments
was not statistically significant. During the nocturnal/sleep
period, the supine IOP under the latanoprostene bunod
treatment was significantly lower than the baseline by 2.5
6 3.1 mm Hg (P ¼ .002) and the timolol treatment by
2.3 6 3.0 mm Hg (P ¼ .004). No IOP difference appeared
during the nocturnal period between the baseline and the
timolol treatment. Considering the latanoprostene bunod
treatment only, the diurnal IOP reduction was larger
than the nocturnal IOP reduction; the difference was 1.5
6 3.0 mm Hg (P ¼ .039, paired t test) for the habitual
body positions (diurnal 3.9 6 2.7 mm Hg vs nocturnal
2.5 6 3.1 mm Hg) and 1.0 6 2.5 mm Hg (P ¼ .077, paired

 t test) for the supine position (diurnal 3.5 6 2.6 mm Hg vs
nocturnal 2.5 6 3.1 mm Hg).
Mean arterial blood pressure showed no significant
change due to either treatment of test agent for the diurnal
sitting, diurnal supine, and nocturnal supine readings. Un-
der the latanoprostene bunod treatment, diurnal sitting
and diurnal supine ocular perfusion pressures were greater
than baseline (P < .001 and P ¼ .006, respectively). How-
ever, no significant change in ocular perfusion pressure was
observed with latanoprostene bunod during the nocturnal
period as compared to baseline. Under the timolol treat-
ment, no significant change in ocular perfusion pressure
from the baseline was observed for the diurnal sitting,
diurnal supine, and nocturnal supine readings. Considering
the 2 test agents, the nocturnal level of supine ocular perfu-
sion pressure under the latanoprostene bunod treatment
was greater than the nocturnal supine ocular perfusion
pressure under the timolol treatment (P ¼ .010). There
was no significant change in the heart rate under the lata-
noprostene bunod treatment. Under the timolol treatment,
diurnal sitting or diurnal supine heart rate was significantly
less than the heart rates under the other 2 experimental
conditions (ranged from P < .001 to P ¼ .002).
DISCUSSION
THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT IOP REDUCTION WITH THE
latanoprostene bunod treatment during the diurnal/wake
period and during the nocturnal/sleep period compared to
baseline. The nocturnal IOP-lowering effect of latanopros-
tene bunod appeared less than the effect during the diurnal
period. Posture was not a factor for the relatively smaller
nocturnal IOP-lowering effect, since both the 24-hour su-
pine IOP profile and the 24-hour habitual IOP profile
showed comparable diurnal vs nocturnal IOP reductions
from the baselines. These results for latanoprostene bunod
were similar to the reported observations for other prosta-
glandin analogues.5,6,10 Based on pharmacokinetics data
from nonhuman primates,11 the difference in the diurnal
and nocturnal IOP-lowering effects was unlikely related
to the bioavailability of latanoprostene bunod given once
daily in the evening.
Low ocular perfusion pressure has been proposed as a risk
factor for glaucomatous damages.25–27 Alteration of ocular
perfusion pressure can occur by changes in mean arterial
blood pressure and/or IOP. Although the mean arterial
blood pressure did not change significantly under either
test agent of latanoprostene bunod or timolol over the
24-hour period, the latanoprostene bunod treatment
increased the diurnal ocular perfusion pressure over the
baseline owing to a significant IOP reduction during the
diurnal period. Treatment with timolol showed no signifi-
cant effect on diurnal ocular perfusion pressure, probably
because of a relatively smaller IOP reduction. Results also
showed a greater nocturnal ocular perfusion pressure under
the latanoprostene bunod treatment compared to the
timolol treatment, reflecting the smaller effect of timolol

 on IOP lowering combined with some reduction in mean
arterial blood pressure. The latanoprostene bunod treat-
ment is expected to be more beneficial than the timolol
treatment if one considers the difference in ocular perfu-
sion pressure during the day and at night.
Latanoprostene bunod is a new monotherapy consist-
ing of a prostaglandin F2a analogue with an NO-
donating moiety that releases NO in situ. Results from
the present study indicate that latanoprostene bunod
eye drops did not lead to a change in systemic blood pres-
sure or heart rate. The present study is not sensitive
enough to determine the effect of increased NO in ocular
tissues.11,19,29 Owing to the small sample size and the
associated statistical power, the present study was not
intended and cannot be used to determine whether or
not the diurnal and nocturnal IOP-lowering effects of
latanoprostene bunod were greater than the effects of
other prostaglandin analogues.5,6,10 To answer the
latter question, a direct comparison of IOP reductions
over 24 hours by the treatments of latanoprostene
bunod and another prostaglandin analogue in the same
group of patients may be needed.
Experimental subjects in the present study were given
timolol 0.5% solution twice daily as the comparator, which
was different from our previous studies that involved sub-
jects treated with timolol 0.5% gel form once daily in the
morning.5,8 Results showed very limited IOP lowering at
night under the treatment with timolol 0.5% solution
twice daily, consistent with a previous report by others.30
Since the bioavailability of timolol solution after the 8
AM dose and after the 8 PM dose should not be very
different, the absence of nocturnal IOP-lowering efficacy
in the present study cannot be explained by pharmacoki-
netic factors. The lack of IOP-lowering effect from dosing
timolol prior to sleep in patients with glaucoma or ocular
hypertension should be a concern.
We observed no statistically significant difference in
sitting IOP, supine IOP, sitting ocular perfusion pressure,
or supine ocular perfusion pressure between the latanopros-
tene bunod and timolol treatments during the diurnal/wake
period. This was likely owing to the small sample size with
inadequate statistical power (commonly required at 0.80)
to detect a significant difference. The final number of 21
participants in the present study provided a statistical po-
wer of 0.65 for the observed mean sitting IOP difference
of 1.2 mm Hg and a statistical power of 0.39 for the
observed mean supine IOP difference of 1.1 mm Hg be-
tween the 2 treatments. The corresponding statistical
powers for the differences in mean sitting and mean supine
ocular perfusion pressures between the 2 treatments were
0.55 and 0.09, respectively. In a recent randomized
double-masked controlled multicenter study, significantly
greater IOP-lowering effect was observed with the latano-
prostene bunod treatment compared to the timolol treat-
ment at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 4 PM based on data from the
final number of 387 participants with open-angle glaucoma
or ocular hypertension.31
In summary, treatment with latanoprostene bunod
0.024% once daily resulted in IOP lowering during the
diurnal/wake period as well as during the nocturnal/sleep
period. Treatment with latanoprostene bunod showed a
greater nocturnal IOP-lowering efficacy compared to

EFFECT OF LATANOPROSTENE BUNOD ON INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE
 treatment with timolol 0.5% solution twice daily. Latano-
prostene bunod treatment significantly increased diurnal
ocular perfusion pressure from the baseline. Ocular
perfusion pressure during the nocturnal period was higher
under latanoprostene bunod treatment than under timolol
treatment.
