AbsTrACT
Objective Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDac) is 
a disease of unmet medical need. While immunotherapy 
with chimeric antigen receptor t (car-t) cells has shown 
much promise in haematological malignancies, their 
efficacy for solid tumours is challenged by the lack of 
tumour-specific antigens required to avoid on-target, off-
tumour effects. Switchable car-t cells whereby activity 
of the car-t cell is controlled by dosage of a tumour 
antigen-specific recombinant Fab-based ’switch’ to afford 
a fully tunable response may overcome this translational 
barrier.
Design in this present study, we have used 
conventional and switchable car-t cells to target the 
antigen Her2, which is upregulated on tumour cells, 
but also present at low levels on normal human tissue. 
We used patient-derived xenograft models derived 
from patients with stage iV PDac that mimic the most 
aggressive features of PDac, including severe liver and 
lung metastases.
results Switchable car-t cells followed by 
administration of the switch directed against human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (Her2)-induced 
complete remission in difficult-to-treat, patient-derived 
advanced pancreatic tumour models. Switchable Her2 
car-t cells were as effective as conventional Her2 
car-t cells in vivo testing a range of different car-t cell 
doses. 
Conclusion these results suggest that a switchable 
car-t system is efficacious against aggressive and 
disseminated tumours derived from patients with 
advanced PDac while affording the potential safety of a 
control switch.
InTrODuCTIOn
Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the 
fourth most common cause of cancer-related deaths, 
with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10%. Due 
to a lack of early symptoms, the disease is mostly 
diagnosed at an advanced stage (stage IV), with less 
than 20% of patients presenting with localised and 
therefore resectable tumours.1 As current therapies 
for patients with advanced disease are merely able 
to extend survival by a few months, PDAC is consid-
ered a disease with an urgent and unmet medical 
need. It is now understood that inherent or rapidly 
evolving chemoresistance and subsequent relapse is 
driven by a subset of cells with stem cell-like prop-
erties.2–4 Any new treatment developed for PDAC 
must also efficiently target this cancer stem cell 
(CSC) population to achieve durable responses.5 
Chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T) 
have shown tremendous success against CD19-ex-
pressing B cell leukaemia.6 7 In contrast, CAR-T 
significance of this study
What is already known on this subject?
 
► Chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell 
therapy has demonstrated remarkable clinical 
success in haematological diseases.
 
► CAR-T cell therapy for pancreatic cancer via 
targeting of HER2 has shown promising results 
in cell line-based models.
 
► Potential on-target off-tumour effects due to 
low-level HER2 expression in the lung and 
other tissues may cause dangerous toxicity 
in patients; a titratable CAR-T system may 
therefore offer potential for safety without 
compromising efficacy.
What are the new findings?
 
► Switchable CAR-T cells followed by 
administration of a Fab-based switch directed 
against HER2 are highly effective against 
difficult-to-treat, patient-derived advanced 
pancreatic tumours
 
► The switchable HER2 platform is as effective as 
conventional HER2 CAR-T cells across a range 
of different CAR-T cell doses in patient-derived 
xenograft models.
 
► Dosage of the HER2 switch elicited significant 
cytokine production from switchable CAR-T 
cells in vivo, suggesting that switchable CAR-T 
cell activity can be modulated in vivo by 
administration (or absence) of switch.
 
► The switchable HER2 platform is expected 
to be an attractive therapeutic option to 
control activation of CAR-T cells for antigens 
such as HER2, which is upregulated in tumours 
but shared with normal tissue.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the 
foreseeable future?
 
► Due to its titratability, the switchable CAR-T cell 
platform against HER2 bears potential to safely 
improve the outcome of patients with advanced 
pancreatic cancer.

cell therapy of solid tumours is hindered by several factors: (1) 
the stiff desmoplastic nature of the tumour microenvironment 
(TME), which creates a physical barrier to T cell entry,8 (2) T cell 
exhaustion and anergy caused by the immune-inhibitory TME,9 
(3) the shared expression of tumour antigens on vital tissues, 
including the stem cell compartment of normal tissues and (4) 
in the case of PDAC, the aggressive nature of the disease as well 
as the fact that diagnosis is usually at a late stage with much 
tumour dissemination. Unlike the B cell antigen CD19, virtually 
all solid tumour antigens are expressed lowly but broadly across 
a variety of normal tissues, which has resulted in severe toxici-
ties in the translation of CAR-T therapy to solid tumours in the 
clinic. For example, a clinical trial using carbonic anhydrase IV 
(CAIX) CAR-T cells for metastatic renal carcinoma had to be 
halted due to liver toxicity that was related to cross-reactivity to 
CAIX-positive bile duct epithelium.10 In another trial, a patient 
with metastatic colon carcinoma treated with a third-generation 
CAR targeting HER2 succumbed to respiratory failure caused 
by CAR-T cells recognising low levels of HER2 expressed on the 
lung epithelium.11
Both CAIX and HER2 are safely targeted with monoclonal 
antibodies, whereby the mechanism of tumour killing is through 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
the activity of the canonical immune response can be safely 
controlled through dosing regimen.12 13 CAR-T cells, however, 
are a living drug that have enhanced T cell signalling through 
the CAR and proliferate extensively on antigen recognition; 
this exaggerated potency reduces the therapeutic window of 
targeting antigens that are expressed on healthy tissue, such 
as CAIX and HER2, and thus increases treatment-associated 
toxicity. Several efforts have thus been made to control the 
activity of CAR-T cells to enable the targeting of antigens with 
toxicity liabilities. We developed an antibody-based switchable 
CAR system whose activity can be titrated in vivo.14 15 These 
switchable CAR-T cells bind a specific peptide that is genetically 
engrafted onto a tumour-binding Fab molecule (figure 1A). The 
‘switch’ acts as a bridge between target and effector cells and 
governs the antigen specificity, activation and ultimately tumour 
clearance. These switches have the advantages of the relatively 
short half-life of the Fab fragment and the use of peptide tags 
with limited immunogenicity.16 17 This versatile system has 
proven to be effective in preclinical models of leukaemia and 
breast cancer.15–17
HER2/ERBB2 has been reported to be expressed in 
PDAC,18 19 though estimates of its prevalence vary widely, from 
10%20 to 60%.21 Here we show that a considerable subset of 
PDAC tumours express HER2 at detectable levels. We also show 
that HER2 is similarly expressed in the contained CSC and their 
differentiated progenies (non-CSC) and can be targeted by both 
healthy donor and patient-derived CAR-T cells. We use highly 
aggressive xenograft models newly generated from current stage 
IV PDAC patients and demonstrate that both local and dissem-
inated disease can be efficiently targeted even when expressing 
relatively modest levels of HER2. Using dose titration of CAR-T 
cells, we demonstrate that switchable CAR-T cells afford compa-
rable efficacy as conventional HER2 CAR-T cells in both orthot-
opic and metastatic PDAC models and that in vivo activity of 
switchable CAR-T cells (unlike conventional HER2 CAR-T cells) 
is contingent on administration of the switch. Our data suggest 
that the titratability of switchable CAR-T cells may allow safe 
targeting of HER2 in a clinical setting.
resulTs
Her2 expression in pancreatic CsC and non-CsC
Assessing HER2 expression on a tissue microarray, we found a 
range of expression on a panel of PDACs, with 6/16 samples 
showing high (3+) HER2 expression, 3/16 samples intermediate 
(2+) and 7/16 samples low (1+) (online supplementary table 1, 
online supplementary figure 1a). We next assessed HER2 expres-
sion in a panel of early passage PDAC cultures (<1 
month in 
culture) isolated from surgical sections of primary tumours from 
patients with stage I/II PDAC. Such cultures are preferred over 
immortalised PDAC cell lines for several reasons: (1) primary 
cultures recapitulate the genetic heterogeneity of the original 
tumour and are more likely to predict an inpatient tumour 
response, (2) primary cultures, similar to the original tumour, 
contain a subpopulation of CSC that represent the root of the 
disease22 and (3) CAR-target antigen expression in primary 
cultures is a more accurate representation of the physiology of 
the original PDAC tumour rather than an artefact of long-term 
cell culture. We found a spectrum of HER2 expression in this 
panel, with some samples expressing HER2 at similar levels to 
the breast cancer line MCF-7 (figure 1B). Cultured human T cells, 
and freshly isolated primary human peripheral blood mononu-
clear cells (PBMC), none of whose subsets express HER2, were 
used as negative controls (online supplementary figure 1b).
We have now also generated various PDAC models from 
patients with stage IV PDAC, the most prevailing population of 
patients in the clinic (c75, c76, c102, c135, c139 and c142). The 
corresponding cultures harbour the most metastatic subpopula-
tions as evidenced by their strong expression of CXCR4, high 
invasiveness and remarkable in vivo metastatic activity and thus 
are highly representative for advanced PDAC.23 We found HER2 
expression in all cases, ranging from modest to very strong 
expression (figure 1C, online supplementary figure 1c).
CSCs represent the hierarchical root of PDAC, drive resis-
tance to conventional therapy and are the principle cause of 
disease relapse. Thus, it is important to test any PDAC therapy 
for efficacy against pancreatic CSC. We therefore generated 
sphere cultures to enrich for CSC and probed sphere-derived 
cells for HER2 expression. We found similar levels of HER2 
expression as in more differentiated adherent PDAC cultures, 
suggesting that HER2 is not altered in pancreatic CSC. HER2 
expression on CSC was further confirmed by costaining for 
CD133 to specifically track CSC (figure 1D,E).
We next transduced cultures from stage I/II PDAC 215 and 
354 and stage IV c76 to stably express GFP and luciferase for 
further analysis. Reprobing these cultures showed that HER2 
expression was maintained after genetic modification, with 
highest expression on PDAC 215 (online supplementary figure 
1d). We therefore used these primary cultures for further in vitro 
and in vivo work.
Her2 CAr-T cells mediate cytotoxicity of Her2-expressing 
PDAC cultures
We used both conventional CAR-T cells and switchable CAR-T 
cells that act via an antibody (Fab)-based ‘switch’ molecule that 
allows control over in vivo activity (figure 1A). To first assess 
susceptibility of primary PDAC cultures to HER2 CAR-T cell 
targeting, we generated second-generation HER2 CAR-T cells 
with the 4-1BB costimulatory domain from normal donors, 
which were found to have similar levels of CD4 and CD8 
expression as untransduced T cells (online supplementary figure 
2a). HER2 CAR-T cells were found to disrupt the monolayer 
of cultures PDAC 215, 354 and c76, and lysis of target cells by

HER2 CAR-T cells was confirmed and quantified using a WST-1 
viability assay (figure 2A). In parallel, we also observed lactat 
dehydrogenase (LDH) release by the target cells on incubation 
with HER2 CAR-T cells (online supplementary figure 2b).
In vitro targeting of primary PDAC cells in an autologous 
setting is more informative for clinical use; however, it is a chal-
lenge to acquire PDAC cells and effector T cells from the same 
patient. As patient c76 was still alive at the time of study, we

had the unique opportunity to investigate autologous CAR-T 
cell effects and to explore whether the relatively modest levels 
of HER2 expression in these target cells might be sufficient for 
successful HER2 CAR-T cell therapy. We isolated T cells from 
this patient for use as effector cells. After two rounds of trans-
duction, about 50% of T cells were found to express HER2 CAR 
(figure 2B). Applying patient c76-derived HER2 CAR-T cells to

PDAC 215 cells led to lysis of the monolayer, while untrans-
duced T cells had no effect (figure 2B). Thus, our data suggest 
that patient-derived T cells can be effectively retargeted to autol-
ogous tumours.
To assess the activity of switchable CAR-T cells against PDAC 
cultures, T cells from healthy donors were transduced with a 
second-generation switchable CAR harbouring a 4-1BB costim-
ulatory domain.17 In vitro cytotoxicity assays were carried out 
by coculture of switchable CAR-T cells with target PDAC cells 
in the presence of a dose titration of the HER2 switch with the 
PNE peptide fused to the C-terminus of the 4D5 HER2 Fab 
(HER2 switch) representing our optimal switch design from 
our previous publication.16 17 An inactive switch comprised 
of the wild-type (WT) HER2 Fab without the PNE was used as 
a control. The HER2 switch mediated potent, dose-dependent 
lysis of various PDAC cultures with maximum levels of cytotox-
icity as assessed by LDH  release, correlating with relative HER2 
expression levels (figure 2C). Comparable levels of cytotoxicity 
were observed on MDA MB 453 HER2 2+ cells. The WT HER2 
Fab had no effect against PDAC cells, demonstrating the spec-
ificity of the switchable CAR-T cells+HER2 
switch for HER2 
expressing cells (figure 2D). We further demonstrated the speci-
ficity of the switchable CAR-T cells at high (104 pM) concentra-
tions of the HER2 switch against PDAC cells using fluorescence 
microscopy and WST-1 viability assays (online supplementary 
figure 2c). Switchable CAR-T cells+inactive 
switch had little 
activity against the PDAC cultures in these assays. Moreover, 
we demonstrated that switchable CAR-T cells + HER2 switch 
mediated significantly higher levels of LDH release from PDAC 
targets than switchable CAR-T cells + inactive switch  (online 
supplementary figure 2d).
CsC-enriched 3D cultures retain susceptibility to Her2 CAr-T 
cell-induced cytotoxicity
The dense matrix within CSC-enriched sphere cultures reca-
pitulates features of the PDAC microenvironment and creates 
a physical barrier to T cell engagement with tumour cells. We 
therefore set up cocultures of PDAC spheres with effector CAR-T 
cells from four different T cell donors (1:1 effector:target (E:T) 
ratio) to test whether CAR-T cell killing of cancer (stem) cells is 
retained in a 3D environment. In all instances, HER2 CAR-T cells 
mediated lysis of both PDAC 215 and 354 sphere cultures, while 
untransduced T cells had no effect (figure 3A). We also assessed 
luciferase activity as a measure of target cell viability. We found 
a significant decrease in luciferase expression following cocul-
ture with HER2 CAR-T cells, demonstrating the ability of HER2 
CAR-T cells to target CSC-enriched PDAC cultures (figure 3B). 
Prior to lysis, spheres were imaged by light microscopy and were 
observed to be targeted by HER2 CAR-T cells, consistent with 
the luciferase results (online supplementary figure 3a). Next, 
we explored the activation of the cytolytic killing machinery 
of CAR-T cells and found a strong upregulation of interferon 
gamma (IFNγ) for both adherent and sphere PDAC cocultures 
(figure 3C). Consistently, HER2 CAR-T cells specifically degran-
ulate on engagement with HER2 antigen of adherent and sphere 
cultures. However, the proportion of T cells undergoing degran-
ulation against sphere cultures was smaller than adherent cells, 
most likely due to the reduced antigen exposure in 3D cultures 
and potential immune evasion mechanisms of the contained 
CSC.24 Of note, higher levels of degranulation were observed 
on coculture with PDAC 215 cells that express higher levels of 
HER2 than PDAC 354, and untransduced T cells did not degran-
ulate in either condition (figure 3D). To further illustrate the 
activation of CAR-T cells in the presence of PDAC sphere targets 
after 3 days of coculture, we performed multiplex staining for 
surface and intracellular T cell markers using Hyperion Imaging 
Mass Cytometry (IMC, Fluidigm), revealing strongly increased 
T cell proliferation combined with enhanced production of the 
cytotoxic molecule Granzyme B (online supplementary figure 
3b).
To further probe CAR-T cell activity in the presence of a 
microenvironment that may serve as a physical barrier, we gener-
ated organoid cultures of PDAC 215 embedded within Matrigel, 
a basement membrane preparation rich in several extracellular 
matrix proteins. After 7 
days of culture, PDAC 215 organoids 
were fully formed, and T cells were overlayed on top of the 
Matrigel. After 3 
days, we observed lysis of the organoids in the 
presence of HER2 CAR-T cells but not for untransduced T cells 
(figure 3E).
Conventional CArs and switch CArs targeting Her2 are 
equally efficacious in an orthotopic stage IV PDAC model
To test the efficacy of HER2 CAR-T and switchable CAR-T cells 
in vivo, we used an orthotopic model of advanced PDAC. We 
chose to use stage IV c76 PDAC cells for two reasons: (1) c76 
cells express HER2 at relatively modest levels, thus setting up 
stringent conditions on CAR-T therapy, and (2) c76 cells estab-
lish extremely aggressive primary tumours with rapid-onset 
metastasis to liver and lung reminiscent of late-stage PDAC in 
patients. We implanted 1e5 c76 PDAC cells into the pancreas of 
immunocompromised NSG mice to develop aggressive orthot-
opic tumours, which predominantly metastasised to liver and 
lung (figure 4A). Disease burden was monitored by non-inva-
sive imaging of bioluminescence (IVIS). At day 17, groups were 
treated with HER2 CAR-T cells, switchable CAR-T cells, or no 
treatment. Animals receiving switchable CAR-T cells were dosed 
with either (1) the HER2 switch or (2) the inactive switch. Switch 
injections were initiated 4 
hours after T cell administration and 
followed every other day thereafter for a total of 14 injections 
(figure 4A).
By day 3 following T cell administration, tumours in the 
switchable CAR-T+HER2 
switch and conventional HER2 
CAR-T cohort were diminished, and by day 10, the tumours 
had disappeared as assessed by IVIS. The mice continued to be 
healthy and tumour free for the duration of the experiment. By 
contrast, tumours in the ‘inactive switch’ and ‘no T cells’ cohorts 
continued to progress, with all animals developing large, rapidly 
growing orthotopic tumours, demonstrating the switchable 
CAR-T cell requires the switch for activity (figure 4B,C, online 
supplementary figure 4a). Consistent findings were obtained by 
high-resolution ultrasound (online supplementary figure 4b). 
At later time points, prominent liver metastases and less abun-
dant lung metastases were also observed in these control mice, 
and HER2 expression was found to be maintained in primary 
tumour as well as metastases (figure 4D).
We observed tumour recurrence at the orthotopic site on a 
single animal in the HER2 CAR-T group on day 109, and rapid 
growth of HER2-expressing tumour cells was observed over 
the subsequent 17 days (online supplementary figure 4a). Read-
ministration of HER2 CAR-T cells from the same donor on 
day 126 led to rapid tumour regression within 3 days (online 
supplementary figure 4a). Tumour recurrence was not observed 
in any other animal in either the HER2 switch or conventional 
HER2 CAR-T cohorts, and all the animals continued to be 
healthy with no signs of morbidity over the duration of the 
study.

To compare efficacy of switchable CAR-T + Her2 switch 
and HER2 CAR-T cells, we next set up a dose titration of T 
cells (at doses of 20e6, 10e6, 5e6 and 1e6) administered to 
NSG mice bearing orthotopic PDAC c76 tumours as before. 
Animals administered switchable CAR-T cells received a total 
of 10 doses of HER2 switches. A single cohort of animals, used 
as a negative control, received 20e6 switchable CAR-T cells 
with inactive switches. Tumour regression was observed in all 
active treatment groups, with nearly complete clearance at 
5e6 T cells per animal for both switchable CAR-T and HER2 
CAR-T groups (figure 5A). Groups treated with 1e6 T cells 
exhibited variable tumours, which were comparable between 
switchable CAR-T and HER2 CAR-T groups. T
wo of five 
animals in the 20e6 (highest T cell dose) HER2 CAR-T cell 
cohort developed GvHD-like symptoms and were sacrificed at 
day 52 (online supplementary figure 5).
We next compared the in vivo activity of switchable CAR-T 
cells (dosed with 0.5 mg/kg HER2 switches) with HER2 
CAR-T cells measured as cytokine release in the circulation 
24 hours after CAR-T cell administration. Similar profiles 
of IFNγ and TNFα cytokine release were observed at each 
T cell dose, consistent with the similar antitumour activity 
mediated by either effector cell type, but IL-2 was higher 
in the HER2 CAR-T cell cohort compared with switchable 
CAR-T cells+HER2 switches. Importantly, we found little to 
no cytokines in switchable CAR-T cells treated with inactive 
switches in mice administered 20e6 switchable CAR-T cells, 
demonstrating the strict requirement of switches for switch-
able CAR-T cell activation (figure 5B).
To assess long-term CAR-T cell activity in vivo, we harvested 
peripheral blood 21 days after the final switch administration in 
the highest (20e6) dose cohorts (online supplementary figure 6). 
Drawing 100 
µL blood from three mice per group followed by 
sorting for human CD2, we detected human CAR-T cells above 
a threshold of 100 events only in one animal in each group. 
This might be due to technical limitations (low cell numbers for 
sorting) and donor-dependent variability, but the samples avail-
able for analysis indicated a 5.7-fold increase in the number of 
switchable CAR-T cells in the presence of HER2 switches (online 
supplementary figure 6a, b). Multiplex phenotypic analysis by 
Hyperion Imaging Mass Cytometry indicated that T cells in both

were dominantly CD8+, consistent with the 4-1BB costimulatory 
domain driving expansion of CD8 cells25 (online supplementary 
figure 6b). Phenotypically, both groups were CD45RA−CCR7−, 
indicative of effector memory cells. Here, we observed striking 
differences for the two groups in the expression of the intracel-
lular cytolytic enzyme Granzyme B and the proliferation marker 
Ki67. Our data suggest persisting activation and replication at 
high levels in HER2 CAR-T cells, while switchable CAR-T cells, 
21 days after the last administration of the HER2 switch, persisted 
but displayed a resting phenotype (online supplementary figure 
6b,c). Persistence of proliferation and production of cytotoxic 
molecules in HER2 CAR-T cells might be due to the graft versus 
host disease (GvHD)-induced activation. Alternatively, it could be 
explained by the presence of residual dormant cancer cells that 
can still be detected in disease-free long-term cancer survivors.26 27 
However, persisting signalling in CAR-T cells with shared normal 
tissue targets might have detrimental effects in the clinic. There-
fore, our data show that unlike conventional CAR-T cells, the in 
vivo activity of switchable CAR-T cells is contingent on adminstra-
tion of switches.
Targeting Her2-expressing PDAC tumours in an aggressive 
metastasis model
Finally, we investigated the efficacy of targeting HER2 in a 
most challenging metastasis model, where c76 PDAC cells 
derived from Stage IV patients were administered intraspleni-
cally to NSG mice and rapidly form metastases due to direct 
drainage from the spleen into the portal vein. After 7 
days, sple-
nectomy is performed to allow large liver metastases to form, 
which typically leads to end-stage disease at about 5 
weeks 
(figure 6). Tumour development was monitored in the mice by 
IVIS.
Fifteen days after tumour administration, CAR-T cells were 
administered, followed by injection of HER2 and inactive 
switches 4 hours later and continued as injections every other 
day for the subsequent 14 days. Rapid tumour clearance was 
observed in the switchable CAR-T cells+HER2 switch and 
conventional HER2 CAR-T cell cohorts. By contrast, two 
out of the three animals in the switchable CAR-T cells+in-
active switch cohort rapidly developed liver metastases as 
well as local tumours at the site of splenectomy (figure 6). 
Figure 4 CAR-T cells efficiently target advanced PDAC in vivo. (A) Schematic of the isolation, culture, and orthotopic injection of PDAC cells derived

cell administration and every 48 hours thereafter for a total of 14 doses. (B) Local tumour progression (left side of animal) and liver metastasis (right

The mice were sacrificed at day 26, confirming the presence 
of liver metastases (online supplementary figure 7). Cytoker-
atin-19 (CK19) immunohistochemistry (IHC)28 using an anti-
body specific to human CK19 further validated the presence 
of micro- and macrometastases in the liver. The remaining 
animal in the switchable CAR-T+inactive switch cohort devel-
oped large liver metastases by day 64. All the animals in the 
switchable CAR-T+HER2 switch and conventional HER2 
CAR-T cohorts remained tumour free for the duration of the 
study, which was defined as 5 months following T cell adminis-
tration. The animals in the conventional HER2 CAR-T cohort 
were sacrificed at 30, 43 and 103 days post-T cell administra-
tion due to the onset of GvHD-like symptoms. The absence of 
tumour was confirmed by IVIS, gross dissection and histology 
with CK19 IHC. Our data therefore confirm the efficacy of 
HER2 targeting in disseminated metastatic PDAC tumours 
via either conventional CAR-T cells or the switchable CAR-T 
systems.

DIsCussIOn
CAR-T cells face unique challenges in the treatment of pancre-
atic cancer. To ensure favourable clinical outcomes, off-tumour 
effects inherent to all CAR-T cells have to be minimised, and 
homing and penetration into the desmoplastic stroma have to 
be successful. Recapitulation of the most aggressive features of 
human disease in mouse xenograft models is a useful tool for 
development of new therapies, as well as for individualised 
therapy for the specific patient. Work in our lab and others 
has shown that patient-derived xenograft models can repro-
duce many characteristics of human disease such as histological 
features, invasive tumour growth and, in some instances, metas-
tases, although the caveat being that the cellular components 
of the TME cannot be modelled in immunodeficient animals. 
Intriguingly, many of our patients with PDAC are still alive 
when using their tissue for in vivo studies such as the present, 
thus the mice could serve as true Avatar models, in which the 
response to treatment is tested by mouse proxies.29 PDAC c76 
that was used in the present study and was derived from a stage 
IV PDAC patient with extensive metastatic disease revealed that 
conventional and switchable CAR-T cells had similar efficacy in 
mediating tumour regression. A major advantage of switchable 
CAR-T was their specific activation in the presence of a switch, 
which represent favourable features for tumour antigens with 
some expression on healthy tissue.
Previous studies in our lab have shown that CSC are a distinct 
population within bulk PDAC tumours with distinct properties 
from differentiated PDAC cells4 5 30 and that CSC drive most resis-
tance to conventional therapy.31 32 We have shown that primary 
PDAC cultures resemble PDAC tumours much more than cell 
lines, in that they have a relatively large CSC compartment, are 
highly tumourigenic in animal models and mimic the natural 
course of the disease.3 33 34 We have also shown that targeting the 
pancreatic CSC compartment efficiently prevents disease relapse 
resulting in long-term survival.35 36 After validating that CSC-en-
riched sphere cultures express HER2, we demonstrate that these 
sphere cultures can be targeted efficiently by HER2 CAR-T cells.
Next, in two distinct in vivo models, we found that a single 
administration of switchable CAR-T cells was sufficient to induce 
durable remission, with tumours becoming undetectable after 
just five HER2 switch injections. In both models, we continued 
to administer switches for a total of 10-14 injections resulting 
in long-term remissions in all treated animals. Importantly, 
after stopping in vivo administration of the HER2 switches for 
3 
weeks, we observed in vivo persisting, but resting switchable 
CAR-T cells as evidenced by lack of proliferation and Granzyme 
B production. These data demonstrate efficient elimination of 
all cancer cells, including the most tumourigenic CSC, validating 
switchable CAR-T cells as powerful yet controllable anticancer 
tools.

were injected into the spleen (day −15). Splenectomy was performed 7 days later (day −8), followed by CAR-T cells 15 days later (day 0). Switches 
were administered starting 4 hours after CAR-T cell administration, and every 48 hours thereafter for a total of 14 doses. (B) Quantification of tumour

Ongoing work in several labs is focused on identifying novel 
truly specific targets for CAR-T cell therapy in solid tumours. 
Some antigens have a fairly restricted expression in normal tissues, 
such as mesothelin (pleura and peritoneum)37 and carcinoembry-
onic antigen (CEA) (colon),38 while others such as CD24 are also 
expressed in the stem cell compartment of normal tissues.39 40 To 
date, antigens such as CD19 have not been identified for solid 
tumours and may never be. Thus, several strategies have been 
developed to mitigate off-tumour on-target off-tumour toxicity 
for antigens upregulated in tumours but shared with normal 
tissue. These approaches include split CAR systems activated 
only in the presence of two tumour antigens41 and iCARs inhib-
ited by antigens expressed on normal tissue.42 Consistent with 
previous reports,15–17 we found similar antitumour effects with 
switches and conventional CARs suggesting that the anti-tumour 
efficacy of the switchable CAR-T system was not compromised. 
Importantly, this demonstrates that the Fab-based switch is able 
to colocalise with switchable CAR-T cells to afford elimination 
of fibrotic pancreatic cancer lesions and cancer (stem) cells.
It is important to note that local and disseminated disease were 
represented in both our models; all the control animals adminis-
tered orthotopic tumours developed extensive liver metastases, and 
two out of three control animals in the metastatic model developed 
local tumours due to rapid invasion of the tissues surrounding the 
spleen. Thus, our data highlight the versatility and efficacy of the 
switchable CAR-T system against aggressive stage IV PDAC. Adop-
tively transferred T cells have been shown to traffic to both antigen 
positive and antigen negative tumours as well as to a variety of 
peripheral tissues,43 which may explain the successful homing of 
the switch and switchable CAR-T cells and rapid regression of the 
disease on HER2- switch administration.
In summary, we demonstrate that switchable CAR-T systems 
and advanced mouse xenograft models that effectively recapitu-
late most features of advanced human PDAC are effective tools 
to enable development of potentially safer and more effective 
therapies for this deadly malignancy.

Cytotoxicity assays
Cytotoxicity was determined using the LDH cytotoxicity assay 
kit II (RayBiotech; 68CX-LDH-S500) according to the manu-
facturer’s instructions. Cytotoxicity assays using anti-PNE 
CAR-T cells and different concentrations of PNE-tagged HER2 
Fab switches were performed using the CytoTox 96 Non-Ra-
dioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) based on the release 
of LDH. We used, as target cells, different PDAC cultures and 
the following breast cancer cell lines as positive controls with 
defined HER2 status: HCC1954 (HER2 3+), MDA MB453 
(HER2 2+), MDA MB435S (HER2 1+) and MDA MB468 
(HER2 0). CAR-T cells were incubated with target cells at an 
effector: target cell ratio of 10:1, while maintaining a total cell 
concentration of 106/mL. PNE-tagged switches were added and 
incubated at 37°C for 20–24 
hours in complete Roswell Park 
Memorial Institute (RPMI) with 10% (vol/vol) heat-inactivated 
fetal calf serum (FCS). WST-1 viability assays were performed 
on adherent PDAC cultures following cytotoxicity with T cells 
and subsequent removal of T cells, using a kit from Roche 
(05015944001). Assays to detect in vitro activity of firefly lucif-
erase were performed using a kit from Promega (E1910).
Organoid cultures of PDAC215 were generated on Matri-
gel-covered 96-well plates overlaid with 5000 PDAC215 cells 
embedded in 50% Matrigel and 50% media. The culture was 
further topped off with organoid media modified from,44

were incubated for 1 
hour at 4°C. The cells were washed again 
with cold PBS and incubated with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated 
goat antihuman antibody (10337882, Fisher Scientific) used as 
a secondary antibody at a 1:200 dilution for 30 
min at 4°C in 
the dark. For some experiments, costaining with CD133-PE 
(Miltenyi Biotec; 1:400) was performed for 30 
min at 4°C in the 
dark. Following one more final wash with cold PBS, cells were 
resuspended in DAPI-containing FACS buffer and analysed by 
flow cytometry on a BD LSR Fortessa (BD Biosciences).
Degranulation assays for expression of CD107a (Biolegend 
328611) were performed following coculture of PDAC cells 
with CAR-T cells or untransduced T cells for 24 
hours. Briefly, 
5 
µL CD107a-Alexa Fluor 647 was added into 200 
µL medium 
containing the cocultured PDAC and T effector cells. Thirty 
minutes later, Monensin (Biolegend) was added for another 
90 
min, followed by Brefeldin (1×; Biolegend) for 4 
hours at 
37°C. Eventually, we stained CD3+ T 
cells using CD3-PECy7 
(Biolegend 317333). For all surface staining, antibodies were 
used at 1:50 in PBS for 10 
min at room temperature and live 
cells negative for 4′,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindol (DAPI; 1 
µg/
mL, Sigma) were analysed on the Fortessa or sorted with the 
ARIA II cell sorter (both BD). To combine surface expression 
of HER2 with quantitative high resolution morphology, we 
used imaging flow cytometry (Imagestream, Amnis) and used 
Cytokeratin-FITC (Miltenyi Biotec 130-112-931; 1:10) to iden-
tify epithelial cells following fixation with 4% paraformalde-
hyde for 15 
min at RT and subsequent permeabilisation using 
PBS+0.1% T
ween-20 (PBS-T).
In vivo experiments
Firefly luciferase expressing PDAC cells were established by 
transducing cells with a PGK-GFP-IRES-Luciferase Lentivector 
system from Addgene. Cells were sorted for GFP expression 
with a FACS BD Aria II instrument (BD, Heidelberg, Germany) 
and subsequently expanded in vitro. Then, 50 
µL of 1×105 
(orthotopic injection) or 0.25×105 (splenic injection) PDAC-Luc 
cells, respectively, were surgically injected either into the spleen 
or pancreas of NSG mice aged 6–8 
weeks (NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid 
Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ; Charles River). To perform surgery, the mice 
were anaesthetised with isofluorane (2%) and an incision was 
made into the left flank of the skin following sedation and 
analgesia. Then, a second incision through the peritoneum was 
carried out and the spleen with adjacent pancreas was visualised 
for the injection of PDAC cells. After closing the peritoneum with 
6/0 sutures (B/Braun; 0022002), the skin was closed by surgical 
staples. An IVIS-200 system (PerkinElmer, Waltham, Massachu-
setts, USA) was used for weekly in vivo luciferase imaging. Mice 
were anesthetised with isoflurane (2%) and injected intraperito-
neally with 150 
mg/kg of luciferin (Caliper Life Sciences) diluted 
15 
mg/mL in PBS. Sequential images were obtained after lucif-
erin injection every 30 
s (maximum light emission, ∼20 
min after 
luciferin injection). Luciferase activity is in photons per second 
per square centimetre per steradian (p/s−1 cm−2 sr−1). Living 
Image software (Caliper Life Sciences) was used for image anal-
ysis. Once tumours become detectable, mice were randomised 
to various treatments. All animal procedures were conducted in 
accordance to the 3Rs and were approved by the Institute’s Insti-
tutional Animal Care and Use Committee (PPL70-8129).

o purify human T cells from the mouse blood, we first sorted for 
CD2 expression by FACS, followed by IMC of the remaining CD2+ 
T cells according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Fluidigm) 
using the antibodies at 1:100. The following metal-conjugated 
antihuman antibodies were used (all from Fluidigm): CD45-Y89, 
CD3-Er170, CD8-Er168, CD4-Nd145, Granzyme-Yb171, Ki67-
Dy162, PD1-Yb174, Tim3-Sm154, Lag3-Nd150, CD45RA-Eu153 
and CCR7-Er167. Prior to the in vivo retrieval of human CAR-T 
cells from Stage IV patient-derived PDAC in vivo models following 
allocated treatment, we validated above antibodies on HER2 CAR-T 
cells in vitro in the presence or absence of activating human PDAC 
sphere cultures. Analysis was carried out using the MCD viewer 
software, and a heat map was generated by Morpheus visualisation 
and analysis software.

ously.3 T

ator followed by enzymatic digestion with collagenase P for 15

Generation of CAr-T cells
Briefly, we used the coding sequences for the anti-GCN4 scFv 
(clone 52SR4) and anti-HER2 scFv (clone 4D5) subcloned into 
the lentiviral plasmid pRRL-SIN-EF1α-WPRE and linked to the

regions of human 4-1BB and CD3ζ to create our second-gener-
ation CAR constructs (for sequence of HER2 CAR, see above). 
Lentiviral particles were produced via transfection of the lenti-
viral constructs into HEK293FT human embryonic kidney cells. 
Cells were transfected with pRRL-SIN-EF1α-WPRE, pMDL, 
pREV and pVSVG plasmids using FugeneHD (Promega). Human 
T cells from healthy volunteers were obtained by Ficoll-Pacque 
purification of PBMCs from normal donor whole blood from 
The Scripps Research Institute’s Normal Blood Donor Service at 
Scripps General Clinical Research Center, under the appropriate 
The Scripps Research Institute’s Institutional Review Board 
approval. PBMCs were further activated for 24 
hours with CD3/
CD28-coated magnetic beads (Life Technologies) before infec-
tion. Concentrated lentivirus was applied to the activated human 
T cells in the presence of 5 
µg/mL protamine sulfate and 50 IU/
mL IL-2 (R&D) and centrifuged at 1000× g for 2 
hours at 32°C. 
The HER2 CAR expression level was determined by flow cytom-
etry with Alexa Fluor 647 (Thermo Fisher)-labelled antihuman 
or antimouse IgG, while the switchable CAR expression levels 
were determined with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled GCN4.
Production of Her2 switches
For GCN4 (PNE sequence: NYHLENEVARLKKL) fusions, 
gene fragments encoding 4D5 heavy or light chains, with 
or without GCN4, were subcloned into the pFuse vector. 
Fusions of the different combinations of heavy or light chains 
were expressed by transient transfection in the FreeStyle 293 
Expression System. Briefly, HEK293F cells were transfected 
at a density of 106 cells/mL with a 1:2 ratio plasmid DNA to

293fectin (Life Technologies). Cells were incubated at 37°C 
with 5% CO2 for 96 hours. The recombinant protein-con-
taining supernatant was harvested at 48 hours and 96 hours 
and further purified by Protein G chromatography.
Immunohistochemistry
Immunohistochemical staining on 2.5 
µM sections was carried 
out using the Ventana Discovery XT system (Roche). Sections 
were deparaffinised, hydrated and loaded on the Discovery XT. 
Antigen retrieval was performed using citrate buffer solution. 
Endogenous peroxidases were quenched using H2O2 reagent 
(Ventana). Primary antibodies against cytokeratin 19 (Abcam 
ab9221; 1:1,000) were incubated for 20 
min and detected using 
an antirabbit secondary antibody and the ChromaMap DAB 
detection kit (Ventana). Tissues were counterstained with haema-
toxylin, and image analysis was performed using Pannoramic 
Viewer Software (3DHISTECH).
For some experiments, after antigen retrieval, slides were 
manually stained with Herceptin Biosimilar (HER35-M, Source 
Bioscience Lifesciences) for 1 hour, followed by Alexa Fluor 
647-conjugated goat antihuman antibody (10337882, Fisher 
Scientific) used at a 1:200 dilution for 30 min. Costaining with 
anti-human pan-cytokeratin-FITC antibody (Miltenyi Biotec 
130-112-931; 1:10) in PBS with 0.1 % T
ween 20 was performed 
for 30 min. All experiments were carried out at room tempera-
ture. As soon as fluorescent antibodies were added, the slides 
were placed in the dark. Slides were mounted with ProLong 
Gold mounting media with DAPI (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Images were acquired using an LSM 710 confocal microscope 
(Zeiss) or a Pannoramic 250 flash III scanner (3DHISTECH). 
statistical analysis
Unless stated otherwise, results are expressed as the means±SD. 
Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS V
.22.0 comparing 
continuous variables by non-parametrical Mann-Whitney U and 
Kruskal-Wallis tests. The significance is given as p<0.05.
