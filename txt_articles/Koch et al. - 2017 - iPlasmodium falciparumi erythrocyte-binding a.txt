Invasion of the red blood cell (RBC) by the Plasmodium parasite de-
fines the start of malaria disease pathogenesis. To date, experimental
investigations into invasion have focused predominantly on the role
of parasite adhesins or signaling pathways and the identity of bind-
ing receptors on the red cell surface. A potential role for signaling
pathways within the erythrocyte, which might alter red cell biophys-
ical properties to facilitate invasion, has largely been ignored. The
parasite erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), a protein required
for entry in most parasite strains, plays a key role by binding to
glycophorin A (GPA) on the red cell surface, although the function
of this binding interaction is unknown. Here, using real-time deform-
ability cytometry and flicker spectroscopy to define biophysical prop-
erties of the erythrocyte, we show that EBA175 binding to GPA leads
to an increase in the cytoskeletal tension of the red cell and a re-
duction in the bending modulus of the cell’s membrane. We isolate
the changes in the cytoskeleton and membrane and show that re-
duction in the bending modulus is directly correlated with parasite
invasion efficiency. These data strongly imply that the malaria para-
site primes the erythrocyte surface through its binding antigens, al-
tering the biophysical nature of the target cell and thus reducing a
critical energy barrier to invasion. This finding would constitute a
major change in our concept of malaria parasite invasion, suggesting
it is, in fact, a balance between parasite and host cell physical forces
working together to facilitate entry.

alaria infections cause ∼438,000 deaths per year, most of
which are due to the protozoan parasite Plasmodium falci-
parum (1). Although extensive eradication efforts have helped to
reduce the incidence of malaria, the spread of drug resistance is a
growing concern and novel treatments are urgently needed (2).
Throughout the Plasmodium life cycle, parasites shuttle between
replicative and motile life-cycle stages, with the motile forms or
“zoites” highly adapted to the invasion of host cells. During the
blood stages of infection, the merozoite targets and invades the
red blood cell (RBC) rapidly (< 30 s) in a process that involves
numerous parasite ligands and host cell receptors (3). Merozoite
entry is a multistep process commencing with initial attachment
and ending with parasite actomyosin-driven invasion (4). Although
extensive cellular and molecular details of each step have been
elucidated (5, 6), there is still little mechanistic understanding of
the role of each protein involved or the signaling events within the
erythrocyte that accompany entry (7).
Initial attachment to the RBC surface is likely mediated by
merozoite surface proteins. Subsequently, the key signaling and
strong attachment interactions between host and parasite mem-
branes are thought to be mediated by two major classes of adhesins
released either before or concomitant with invasion at the mero-
zoite apex. These adhesins are the erythrocyte binding-like [EBL,
or erythrocyte-binding antigen (EBA)] and reticulocyte binding-
like (RBL, or Rh) protein families, composed in P. falciparum of
the EBA175, EBA140, EBA181, and EBL1 proteins and the Rh1,
Rh2a, Rh2b, Rh4, and Rh5 proteins, respectively (8, 9). Although
the binding between Rh5 and its receptor, Basigin, is the only
ligand–receptor interaction identified to date that is essential for all
P. falciparum strains (10), EBA175 and its interaction with glyco-
phorin A (GPA) is nonetheless functionally almost universally
important (11). When EBA175 function is ablated (e.g., geneti-
cally), some strains are able to switch to an alternative invasion
pathway using the interaction of Rh4 and its receptor CR1 (12).
The precise function of each ligand–receptor complex during in-
vasion is largely unknown; however, in recent years, it has become
clearer that these interactions do not merely serve for adhesion
but, instead, may be involved in transducing signals into either the
merozoite (13, 14) or potentially the RBC (7).
Recently, we attempted to model invasion in terms of the
biophysical forces required to enwrap a merozoite toward full
RBC entry. Of particular focus were the properties of membrane
tension (which, in the RBC, is primarily provided by the cyto-
skeleton) and bending modulus (the energy required to cause
bending of the lipid bilayer) (15). Although the actin-myosin
motor provides a critical force to push the merozoite into the
host cell, other factors could significantly contribute to lowering the
Significance
The blood-stage malaria parasite, the merozoite, invades the
human red blood cell (RBC) using receptor–ligand interactions
between the parasite and host cell surface, yet the function of
these interactions to invasion is not known. We have analyzed
the binding between one key merozoite invasion ligand, called
erythrocyte-binding antigen 175 (EBA175), and glycophorin A on
the RBC surface (the most dominant surface antigen) and ex-
plored how this interaction affects the biophysical properties of
the red cell. Using a combination of imaging techniques, we
demonstrate that the malaria parasite changes the biophysical
nature of the red cell, facilitating its own entry by effectively
reducing the energy barrier to invasion. This study demonstrates
a red cell biophysical contribution to merozoite entry.

 energy barrier for invasion. These factors include energy gains from
tight adhesion to the host cell (via receptor–ligand interactions) or
manipulation of the host cell cytoskeletal or membrane properties,
each of which could facilitate wrapping of the merozoite. Beyond
malaria invasion biology, binding of two critical red cell receptors
used by the merozoite during invasion (CR1 and GPA) have been
shown to transmit biophysical changes to the RBC when bound by
certain ligands (16, 17). To date, it has not been assessed whether
parasite ligands during invasion transmit similar changes, poten-
tially influencing invasion efficiency.
Here, we explore the hypothesis that parasite ligands prime the
RBC by changing its biophysical properties, reducing the energy
barriers for invasion. Using two separate techniques, we demon-
strate that binding of the merozoite ligand EBA175 to its receptor
GPA causes distinct biophysical changes to the RBC. EBA175
binding causes an increase in cytoskeletal tension, which is de-
pendent on the cytoplasmic tail of the GPA protein. EBA175
binding also causes a reduction in the bending modulus of the
membrane. Chemically induced reduction of the bending modulus
significantly increases invasion efficiency, supporting our hypoth-
esis that parasite-dependent RBC changes reduce the energy
barrier for successful malaria parasite entry into the human
erythrocyte.
Results
EBA175 Region II Binding to GPA Alters RBC Deformability. Theoretical
models and phosphoproteomic studies suggest that the P. falci-
parum merozoite triggers host changes to facilitate its invasion on
binding to the RBC (7, 15). To explore whether these changes are
mediated by EBAs, we investigated the effect of EBA175 binding
to its RBC receptor, GPA, on overall erythrocyte biophysical
properties. This receptor–ligand interaction is specific; it is me-
diated by glycosylated residues on GPA that are absent in other
glycophorin molecules (18). Using a recombinantly expressed
receptor-binding region (region II) of EBA175 (rEBA175-RII)
(19, 20), we first validated receptor specificity of the protein in-
cubated with untreated or neuraminidase (Neu)-treated human
RBCs (Fig. 1A), with the latter ablating sialic acid residues on
GPA, which are known to be crucial for binding (21).
Having
demonstrated
the
Neu-binding
specificity
of
the
rEBA175-RII ligand, we next incubated RBCs with different
concentrations of the protein before analyzing cells using real-time
deformability cytometry (RT-DC) (22). This flow cytometry-based
technique permits the label-free analysis of ∼1,000 cells per sec-
ond, making it particularly useful for analyzing cells that show
natural variability in their biophysical characteristics, such as
RBCs (23). For untreated cells, analysis of deformation versus cell
size (cross-sectional area) found that most cells were contained
within one population, with an average cross-sectional area of
36.5 μm2 (Fig. 1B). A second population of larger cells (>50 μm2),
when manually inspected, was found to contain cell clumps, pre-
dominantly doublets (Fig. 1B). Because RT-DC analysis is based
on extracting cell contours to quantify cell deformation, and
contours of doublets could potentially lead to a skew in the data
dependent on the shape of the cell clump, such clumps were re-
moved from downstream analyses by creating a gate containing
the singlet RBC population (Fig. 1B). Incubation of RBCs with
rEBA175-RII resulted in many of the cells forming larger clumps
(Fig. 1C). These aggregates were removed from our analysis as
described above. RT-DC measurements of RBCs treated with
25–50 μg/mL rEBA175-RII, a concentration similar to the con-
centration previously used for antibody studies (24), revealed a
significant reduction in RBC deformability (Fig. 1D). At higher
concentrations of rEBA175-RII, a significant proportion of RBCs
were present in cell doublets or clumps, complicating analysis
using this technique. To test the specificity of these identified
biophysical changes, rEBA175-RII was also incubated with Neu-
treated RBCs (Fig. 1E). These cells do not show a decrease in
deformability, confirming this effect to be specific to rEBA175-
RII binding.
Flicker Spectroscopy of RBC Biophysical Parameters. To determine
the cause of biophysical changes seen by RT-DC, we sought to use a
method that would permit independent measurement of the tension
and bending modulus of the RBC surface on EBA175 binding.
Membrane fluctuation analysis (flicker spectroscopy) has been used
extensively as a method for mechanical characterization of vesicles
(25, 26) and erythrocytes (27–29) at the single-cell level. Critically
for our purposes, the cytoskeletal and lipid membrane properties
dominate different ranges of the fluctuation spectrum. It is well
established that tension in RBCs largely arises from the cytoskele-
ton underlying the erythrocyte bilayer and that changes in tension
are primarily reflected in the lower fluctuation mode numbers (Fig.
S1). Conversely, variations in the RBC bending modulus are largely
expected to come from changes to the cell membrane, and this
parameter is reflected in the higher mode numbers (27) (Fig. S1).
Although many chemicals known to induce cellular biophysical
changes have wide-ranging effects causing both cytoskeletal and
membrane alterations, we sought to validate the assumptions out-
lined above by inducing several controlled biophysical changes in
RBCs to confirm the reliability of flicker spectroscopy in detecting
erythrocyte cytoskeletal and membrane changes. Glutaraldehyde
preferentially cross-links proteins, and is therefore expected to af-
fect cytoskeletal properties (i.e., tension), although it can interact
with and cross-link amino groups on phospholipids (30). In agree-
ment with this expectation, at 0.01% glutaraldehyde, RBC tension
increased significantly (Fig. 2A), with no significant effect on
bending modulus (Fig. 2B). Fig. S2A shows representative spectra of
individual RBCs from each treatment sample. At higher concen-
trations, membrane oscillations were reduced to negligible levels
(Fig. S2A), suggesting that all protein and membrane constituents
had been cross-linked. As a further test, we explored diamide, an
oxidizing reagent that has previously been shown to cause tightening
of the RBC cytoskeleton and reduce RBC deformability (31) (Fig. 2

 C and D and Fig. S2B). Treatment of RBCs with 50 μM and
500 μM diamide resulted in a concentration-dependent increase in
tension (Fig. 2C) in line with previously published work (31). Al-
though the exact effect of RBC treatment with diamide on its
bending modulus has not previously been tested, the bending
modulus change (Fig. 2D) is comparable to that seen with other
oxidative reagents, which cause lipid peroxidation resulting in higher
bending modulus (32) as well as reduced membrane fluidity (33).
We next sought to isolate the effect of changing bending
modulus, specifically targeting RBC lipid properties. X-ray dif-
fraction measurements and molecular dynamic simulations sug-
gest that DMSO disrupts interactions between the headgroups of
different lipids, decreasing bilayer thickness and increasing mem-
brane fluidity (34, 35). These simulations suggest that at a DMSO
concentration of 5%, the average area between the inner and outer
membrane layers would be reduced by ∼10%. Similarly, at 15%
DMSO, the area reduction would be expected to be >55%. Tests at
both concentrations by flicker spectroscopy (Fig. 2 E and F and Fig.
S2C) demonstrated that the bending modulus was indeed reduced
at both 5% and 15% DMSO (Fig. 2F); however, this reduction was
only statistically significant at 15%. Of note, at this concentration,
some RBCs (omitted from analysis) undergo morphological
changes wherein tension (Fig. 2E) is also affected, likely due to the
stress caused by the high percentage of DMSO used.
As a final way of experimentally validating our flicker ap-
proach, we investigated use of 7-ketocholesterol (7-KC), a probe
that reduces lipid packing and lipid order by integrating into the
RBC membrane (36). We found that 7-KC significantly and
specifically reduces bending modulus without affecting tension
properties (Fig. 2 G and H and Fig. S2D). Collectively, these
data demonstrate our ability to decouple membrane and cyto-
skeletal changes in the RBC using flicker spectroscopy.
EBA175 Binding to GPA Triggers Specific RBC Cytoskeletal and Membrane
Changes. Having established adequate controls, we next investigated
how EBA175 binding to the RBC affects cytoskeletal and mem-
brane properties of the target cell. In agreement with the RT-DC
data as well as previous biophysical data examining GPA binding by
antibody moieties (24), we found a clear concentration-dependent
increase in RBC tension on addition of rEBA175-RII (Fig. 3A and
Fig. S3A). At very low concentrations, we noticed a small but re-
producible reduction in tension at low rEBA175-RII concentra-
tions, suggesting the RBC biophysical response to rEBA175-RII
might be a nonlinear concentration-dependent effect at low con-
centrations (Fig. 3A). Noticeably, this reduction in tension was also
present using RBCs pretreated with Neu, supporting the notion that
a small number of binding sites are still present following enzyme
treatment, giving rise to the small effect alone. For bending mod-
ulus, rEBA175-RII binding significantly reduced values across a
wide range of concentrations (Fig. 3B and Fig. S3B). This finding
was dependent on sialic acid residues, confirming that the change is

 binding-specific (Fig. 3B). The effects of rEBA175-RII on RBC
biophysical properties were reproducible across different RBC
samples (Fig. 3 C and D and Fig. S3B).
Significance of RBC Tension for Parasite Invasion. To investigate the
relevance of the rEBA175-RII–mediated tension and bending mod-
ulus changes to parasite invasion, each component was isolated to test
its importance independently. Previous studies using anti-GPA anti-
bodies have shown that the binding-mediated decrease in deform-
ability occurs through signaling involving the GPA cytoplasmic tail
(24). We therefore hypothesized that in the absence of this region,
rEBA175-RII would not initiate an increase in tension. To test this
hypothesis, we used RBCs isolated from an individual with an ex-
tremely rare human glycophorin variant, the Miltenberger class V
(MiV) condition, in which GPA and GPB are replaced with a hybrid
GPA-GPB protein. This protein contains the extracellular regions of
GPA, but the shortened intracellular tail of GPB (18, 37), which is
not predicted to interact with the underlying cytoskeleton as wild-type
GPA does. Entirely in line with predictions, rEBA175-RII did not
cause an increase in tension in MiV RBCs (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4).
Indeed, in the absence of the cytoplasmic GPA tail, EBA175 binding
caused a small but noticeable decrease in tension instead. Un-
expectedly, the bending modulus decrease still occurred in MiV cells
(Fig. 4B and Fig. S4), suggesting that this biophysical change is in-
dependent of the interaction between the cytoplasmic tail of GPA
and the RBC interior.
Although the importance of the glycophorins for erythrocyte in-
vasion by P. falciparum is indisputable (12, 18, 38), some parasite
strains have evolved to invade independent of GPA. If the GPA tail-
mediated tension change following EBA175 binding was required for
invasion, parasites that relied on GPA for invasion would be expected
to invade MiV RBCs less efficiently than parasites invading via a
GPA-independent pathway. To test this hypothesis, we purified ma-
ture schizonts from two strains, W2mefΔRh4 and W2mefΔEBA175,
and incubated these schizonts with either MiV cells or normal RBCs.
W2mefΔRh4 parasites, lacking Rh4, rely on EBA175–GPA in-
teraction for invasion (12). W2mefΔEBA175 parasites are, in con-
trast, able to invade RBCs independent of EBA175–GPA interaction.
No significant differences were found in the ability of either parasite
strain to invade MiV RBCs (Fig. 4C). This finding suggests that,
contrary to expectations, the tension increase triggered by the cyto-
skeletal tail of GPA is not required for invasion.
Significance of RBC Bending Modulus for Parasite Invasion. Having
assessed the role of tension in invasion, we next sought to assess the
relationship between bending modulus and P. falciparum invasion
directly. Because bending modulus describes the amount of energy
required to bend a lipid bilayer, a reduction in this property would
also decrease the energy barrier to invasion and, as such, would be
predicted to increase parasite invasion efficiency (15). This bending
modulus reduction might derive from changes in lipid composition
[e.g., the percentage of cholesterol (39)], asymmetry between inner
and outer membrane leaflets (25), or the extent of lipid chain
saturation or modification (40), each of which has been described
to affect membrane thickness and bending modulus. To begin to
assess whether the decrease in bending modulus following GPA
binding resulted from changes in membrane asymmetry, we tested
whether binding of rEBA175-RII to its RBC receptor triggered
calcium changes (associated with scramblase activation in the
RBC) or externalization of lipid moieties normally limited to the
internal membrane leaflet. Fluro-4 acetoxymethyl ester (Fluo-4
AM) and Annexin V labeling of RBCs in the presence or
absence of rEBA175-RII found no evidence for calcium signaling
(marked by Fluo-4 AM) (Fig. 5A) or for a differential external-
ization of phosphatidylserine (marked by Annexin V) (Fig. 5B), as
opposed to incubation with the calcium channel activator Yoda 1
(used here as a positive control) (41). This result suggests asym-
metry is not the direct cause of the reduction in bending modulus.
At present, therefore, the direct cause of the reduction in bending
modulus remains to be elucidated.
To explore the significance of a reduction in bending modulus,
and given the essential role of the GPA invasion route for sialic
acid-dependent invasion, which is not attributable to the changes
in tension, we investigated whether an experimentally induced
reduction in this parameter improved invasion efficiency. Pre-
treatment with 7-KC has been shown to reduce lipid packing/
order in membranes (42), and as demonstrated above (Fig. 2 G
and H and Fig. S2D), it leads to a reduction in bending modulus.
Pretreatment of RBCs with 7-KC would therefore be predicted
to increase invasion efficiency if parasite-induced reduction of
bending modulus is a key parameter for invasion. RBCs pre-
treated with 7-KC to decrease the bending modulus were more
readily invaded by P. falciparum merozoites (Fig. 5 C and D).
These results demonstrate a clear linkage between parasite-
induced changes in the RBC surface and invasion ligand bind-
ing, the direct consequence of which is to change RBC bio-
physical properties to increase invasion efficiency. Combined,
these data strongly imply that P. falciparum merozoites alter the
target erythrocyte’s biophysical properties before invasion to
facilitate their own entry.
Discussion
Here, complementary biophysical approaches demonstrate that
binding of the malaria parasite invasion ligand EBA175 to its
host cell receptor GPA triggers a biophysical response in the
RBC. Exploration of this change identified a reduction in the
RBC bending modulus on binding, which itself significantly in-
creases invasion efficiency. Thus, consistent with biophysical
predictions of the energetics involved in invasion (15), the
malaria parasite does appear to alter the RBC surface to facili-
tate its own entry.
One of the key challenges with biophysical approaches that
explore changes in RBC properties is differentiating between
contributions arising from cytoskeletal and membrane changes. By
using a number of chemical reagents previously described to affect
cytoskeletal and lipid properties (i.e., glutaraldehyde, diamide,
DMSO, 7-KC), we confirm that we can distinguish between
changes occurring within the cytoskeletal and lipid membrane

 components described by tension and bending modulus. This
ability provides a key foundation for investigating the RBC bio-
physical response to binding by the invasion ligand EBA175.
Both biophysical techniques used in this study identified an in-
creased rigidification (reduction in RBC deformability/increase in
tension) at the higher concentrations tested (≥10 μg/mL rEBA175-
RII), which is in agreement with previous work using GPA anti-
bodies (24, 43, 44). Of interest, we measured a small, but repeatable,
reduction in tension at low concentrations by flicker spectroscopy.
This result would suggest that the interaction between EBA175 and
GPA, and resulting changes in the RBC, is not a linear relationship.
In the context of merozoite invasion, where the absolute number of
EBA175 molecules at the RBC interface is unknown, several dif-
ferent scenarios could arise that have an impact on the invasion
process. At the invasion site, a higher local EBA175 concentration
could significantly change the local tension and bending modulus
conducive to invasion (model in Fig. S5). Additionally, diffuse
EBA175 on the RBC surface [or shed from the parasite surface (45)]
may affect the wider RBC, either triggering further changes con-
ducive to invasion or potentially binding to bystander RBCs, thereby
lowering their energy barrier for invasion events.
Of the two key changes in tension and bending modulus, it is
surprising that the cytoskeletal changes, as mediated by the cy-
toplasmic tail of GPA, were not found to be essential for in-
vasion in vitro. This finding contradicted our expectation that
increased cross-linking of the GPA tail upon EBA175 binding
might be functional for invasion, for instance, serving as a focal
point where the RBC cytoskeleton could be opened up around
the invading parasite or providing stability for the tight junction
(46). This result suggests that direct cross-linking of GPA to the
cytoskeleton via its cytoplasmic tail does not significantly impact
invasion efficiency.
In contrast, a reduction in bending modulus, which still oc-
curred in MiV cells, appears to be one of the critical roles of
EBA175 binding. Bending modulus is an intrinsic property of the
lipid bilayer that describes the amount of energy required to bend it
and is affected by lipid composition, membrane thickness, and
membrane asymmetry. These properties regulate numerous cellular
functions through membrane curvature (47), endocytosis (48),
opening of protein channels (49), and initiation of signaling pro-
cesses (50), and, unsurprisingly, they are often exploited by in-
tracellular pathogens (40, 51). We were therefore intrigued by the
possibility that the architecture of the lipid bilayer might be
exploited by the merozoite during invasion. Invasion into RBCs
pretreated with 7-KC, mimicking the bending modulus decrease
caused by GPA binding, demonstrated that invasion efficiency
for both sialic acid-dependent (W2mefΔRh4) and -independent
(W2mefΔEBA175) strains significantly increased. This result stron-
gly suggests that parasite–host interactions trigger RBC biophysi-
cal responses that contribute to invasion efficiency. What is the
nature of this change? Because the decrease in bending modulus
is not dependent on the cytoplasmic tail of GPA, this change
might arise through a reduction in the lateral pressure within the
membrane caused by a conformational change in GPA. Just as
transmembrane proteins (i.e., mechanosensors) can be regulated
by forces exerted on them by the lipid bilayer, transmembrane-
and membrane-associated proteins are also capable of affecting
membrane properties by modulating the bilayer structure (52).
Dimerization of EBA175 around GPA could lead to a confor-
mational change in GPA within the membrane, effectively freeing
up space in the bilayer and reducing lateral pressure (and hence
bending modulus) (25). The fact that EBA175 binding causes a
signaling cascade in the RBC is not surprising, given that the strong
RBC deformations that occur during invasion are dependent on
the EBA175–GPA interactions (6, 13). Future efforts should focus
on identifying molecular and/or signaling events that lead to these
biophysical changes.
Materials and Methods
Methods for parasite culture, measuring invasion efficiency, erythrocyte
binding, and flow cytometry followed standard approaches. A full description
of these methods and details of statistical analysis are provided in SI Materials
and Methods.
RT-DC. Fifty microliters of packed RBCs were incubated with appropriate
concentrations of EBA175-RII at room temperature for 1 h before being drawn
into a 1-mL syringe and connected to a custom-made polydimethylsiloxane
(PDMS) microfluidic chip. Cells were recorded at ∼2,000 frames per second (fps)
using a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) based camera
(MC1362; Mikrotron) and an NI-1433 Frame Grabber (National Instruments) as
they travel through the PDMS chip at flow rates of 0.4–0.12 μL·s−1. The extent of
deformation is extracted from the cross-sectional area calculated using a
custom-derived contour-tracking algorithm. A full discussion of the technique
and analysis is provided by Otto et al. (22).
Flicker Spectroscopy. RBCs were diluted into RPMI-1640 (Sigma–Aldrich) at
0.5% hematocrit and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. Fluctua-
tion videotapes were recorded on a Nikon Ti Microscope (objective lens:
Nikon Plan Apo 100× 1.4-N.A. oil immersion) using an OrcaFlash4.0 CMOS
camera. Approximately 4,500 frames were recorded at a frame rate of
150 fps and an exposure time of 1 ms. Data analysis was carried out using a
custom-built LabVIEW (National Instruments) program that detects and ex-
tracts membrane contours from each frame with subpixel resolution. Full
details of membrane fluctuation analysis are given elsewhere (27). Briefly,
the deviation of each contour from the mean membrane position was
decomposed into fluctuation modes by Fourier transforming to give a
fluctuation power spectrum of mean square mode amplitudes at the cell
equator [h2(qx, y = 0)] as a function of mode wavenumber (qx). From these
data, the bending modulus (κ) and tension (σ) can be fitted using the fol-
lowing equation:

where kB is the Boltzmann constant, T is temperature, and L is mean cir-
cumference of the cell contour. This model assumes that the cell surface
behaves as a flat sheet and that we image the equator of the cell. When
fitting the fluctuation data, mode numbers 4 and below were excluded due
Fig. 5.
RBCs treated with 7-KC to decrease bending modulus are more
readily invaded than control RBCs. RBCs pretreated with Fluo-4 AM (A) were
incubated with rEBA175-RII and then stained with annexin V (B). Calcium
influx (A) and phosphatidylserine exposure (B) were assessed by flow
cytometry. Ctrl, control. (C and D) RBCs were treated with varying concen-
trations of 7-KC for 30 min and then washed and resuspended in fresh media
before parasite schizonts were added. Parasite invasion [Rel. Parasitemia
(%)] was quantified by flow cytometry. Strains used were w2mefΔEBA175
(C) and w2mefΔRh4 (D). Rel., relative. P values comparing the treatment
versus control were calculated using the Student’s t test (*P < 0.05; **P <
0.01; ***P < 0.001).

 to significant influence of the cell shape (breakdown of the flat sheet as-
sumption) and mode numbers above 20 were removed because these fluc-
tuations lie outside the spatial and temporal resolution of the experiment.
The tension and bending modulus terms dominate different parts of the
fluctuation power spectrum (and can be attributed to distinct cellular
properties as described below), and so can be resolved independently using
a double-parameter nonlinear fit to the model above.
