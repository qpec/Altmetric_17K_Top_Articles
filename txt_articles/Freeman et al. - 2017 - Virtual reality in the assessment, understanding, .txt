Mental health problems are inseparable from the environment. With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive
environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psy-
chological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to
describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic
review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory
development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substance-
related disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality
of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established
finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treat-
ment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive
technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental
health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if – with the user experience at the heart of design – the
best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate
reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the tech-
nology’s ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging.

Introduction
A technological revolution in mental health care is
approaching. At the forefront may be virtual reality
(VR), a powerful tool for individuals to make new
learning for the benefit of their psychological well-
being. Immersive VR creates interactive computer-
generated worlds, which substitute real-world sensory
perceptions with digitally generated ones, producing
the sensation of actually being in life-sized new envir-
onments. VR allows such tight control over the stimuli
presented that therapeutic strategies can be precisely
implemented; VR can produce situations that can be
therapeutically helpful if used in the right way but
near impossible to recreate in real life; VR allows
repeated, immediately available and greater treatment
input; and VR can reduce inconsistency of treatment
delivery. With high-quality VR devices reaching the
consumer market for the first time, the future is sud-
denly imminent. The affordability makes it feasible
for the technology to break out of the laboratory and
enter the home – and forward-thinking mental health
clinics too.
VR
The basic elements of VR – a computer generating an
image, a display system presenting the sensory infor-
mation, and a tracker feeding back the user’s position
and orientation in order to update the image – have
existed for 50 years. The hardware recognizable
today emerged in the 1980s but has been largely
confined
to
specialist
laboratories
(Slater
&
Sanchez-Vives,
2016).
Systems
vary
greatly.
For
example, the Cave Automatic Virtual Environment
(CAVE) projects computer images onto the walls of a
room and the participant wears tracked shutter glasses
to view the scene three-dimensionally (Cruz-Neira
et al. 1993). Sometimes described as VR are much
lower-specification systems that use displays on com-
puter monitors or large projector screens, but the

 limited levels of immersion and interaction make it
questionable whether these are truly VR. The current
excitement relates to the new generation of head-
mounted display (HMD) and associated equipment
that have emerged as affordable consumer products
due
to
the
investment
of
global
companies.
Smartphones, laptops or desktop computers can run
the software. VR is moving out of specialist laborator-
ies. The transformation in what the hardware and soft-
ware can now realize compared with even a few years
ago is great.
An HMD displays images, one for each eye, forming
an overall stereo scene. Each image is computed and
rendered separately with correct perspective from the
position of each eye with respect to a mathematical
description of a three-dimensional (3D) virtual scene.
The HMD is typically tracked, with continuous captur-
ing of the position and orientation of the participant’s
head and therefore head-based gaze direction. As par-
ticipants turn or move their head to look around, the
computer updates at a very high frame rate – typically
60 frames per second – the images displayed. Therefore
participants see a surrounding 3D stereo scene that can
change dynamically. Although much VR program-
ming has omitted it, one particular object in the
scene can have special status – the virtual body of
the participant. At its simplest, this visual substitution
of the person’s real body can be aligned to the head
tracking. But if the participant wears a motion-tracking
capture suit with an HMD, then the data from this,
continuously streamed to the computer, will effectively
substitute the body of the participant by a life-sized
virtual body that fully moves in correspondence with
their own movements, leading to the illusion of body
ownership (Slater et al. 2010; Spanlang et al. 2014).
Perception through natural movement is the key
element of an immersive VR system. Immersion
reflects the system’s technical capabilities; the subject-
ive experience delivered is termed ‘presence’, which
is the illusion of being in the place rendered by VR.
Presence comprises two concepts: place illusion (PI)
and plausibility illusion (Psi) (Slater, 2009). PI is the
sense of being in the virtual place. A necessary condi-
tion for PI is that the VR is perceived through natural
sensorimotor contingencies, based on the active vision
paradigm (Noë, 2004). The idea of this paradigm is that
we perceive through using our whole body, via a set of
implicit rules involving head turning, leaning, reach-
ing, looking around and so on. The illusion of ‘being
there’ is generated to the extent that the VR system
affords perception through such contingencies. If
what we see matches our movements then the brain’s
conclusion is that these are our surroundings. The Psi
is the sense that the events experienced in VR are hap-
pening (e.g. that there are people walking about, that a
ball is flying through the air), even though, of course,
individuals consciously know that these are not real.
Psi requires that the virtual environment responds to
actions of the participants, generates spontaneous
actions towards them, and is ecologically valid when
real-life events are depicted. For example, when the
environment includes virtual human characters, these
avatars should respond to the presence and actions
of the participants (e.g. by gaze and maintaining
appropriate interpersonal distances). When both PI
and Psi operate, participants will be likely to behave
realistically in VR.
VR and mental health
VR has extraordinary potential to help people over-
come mental health problems if high levels of presence
are
achieved
for
situations
that
trouble
them.
Difficulties interacting in the world are at the heart of
mental health issues [e.g. becoming highly anxious
near spiders in arachnophobia, having intense flash-
backs with reminders of past trauma in post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), fearing attack from people in
persecutory delusions, resisting the urge to take
another drink in alcohol abuse disorders]. Therefore
recovery concerns thinking, reacting and behaving dif-
ferently in these situations. The most successful inter-
ventions are those that enable people to make such
changes in real-world situations. With VR, individuals
can enter simulations of the difficult situations and be
coached in the appropriate responses, based upon the
best theoretical understanding of the specific disorder.
The simulations can be graded in difficulty and repeat-
edly experienced until the right learning is made.
Problematic situations difficult to find in real life can
be realized at the flick of a switch. And the great
advantage of VR is that individuals know that a com-
puter environment is not real but their minds and bod-
ies behave as if it is real; hence, people will much more
easily face difficult situations in VR than in real life and
be able to try out new therapeutic strategies. The learn-
ing can then transfer to the real world. For some disor-
ders it may be possible to eradicate the need for any
therapist input, while for other disorders the time
required of skilled therapists could be greatly reduced.
Thus VR could help improve access to the most effect-
ive psychological treatments. It may become the
method of choice for psychological treatment: out
with the couch, on with the headset.
There are also many other potential uses of VR in
mental health. We originally set out seven purposes
(Freeman, 2008): symptom assessment, identification
of symptom markers or correlates, establishment of
factors predictive of disorders, tests of putative causal
factors, investigation of the differential prediction of

 symptoms, determination of toxic elements in the
environment, and the development of treatment. For
instance, standard mental health diagnosis chiefly
comprises retrospective recall using clinician interview
and
validated
questionnaires.
Inevitably,
human
beings tend to be very subjective in their views.
Memory, moreover, is notoriously fallible. In the clinic
of the future, it is possible that problems could also be
assessed live in VR. The technology could also help
make
substantial
inroads
into
understanding
the
causes of mental health disorders, for example, pin-
pointing the environmental characteristics that raise
the risk of adverse psychological reactions in the con-
text of individual differences.
The aim of this paper is to highlight for clinicians
and researchers in mental health the potential of VR
technology. This includes a review of what has been
learned empirically from the first generation of studies
about the use of VR in assessing, understanding and
treating the main adult mental health disorders. We
wished to identify established findings, obvious areas
of neglect and new directions of interest. These are
the studies that have been conducted in specialist
laboratories over the past 20 years, before the current
transformation in availability and capabilities of the
technology. It is the ambition of these pioneering stud-
ies that we aim to capture, as new hardware and soft-
ware are dramatically altering what can be created in
VR and the ease of use.
Method
The literature on VR in mental health was searched up
to the end of 2016. The inclusion criteria were: a
specific focus on the assessment, theory, or treatment
of adult mental health disorders; published in a peer-
reviewed journal; was an empirical study (including
case studies with data); used a form of immersive VR
(HMD, CAVE, large projection screen, screen with 3D
glasses); and in the English language. The exclusion
criteria were: non-immersive VR method [e.g. personal
computer (PC) screen only, websites such as Second
Life]; qualitative data or review; unable to obtain the
paper; use of VR but no specific focus on a mental
health symptom or condition. We did not look at
health psychology, cognitive disorders, personality
disorders, childhood-onset disorders, or at the effects
of VR games that were not designed as interventions.
PubMed was used for the searches, which were con-
ducted separately by major disorder types. The general
search terms were: [([Virtual reality OR Immersive vir-
tual reality] AND [Assessment OR treatment OR
research OR study OR experiment OR understanding])
AND (disorder-specific terms inserted here)] AND
English (language). For anxiety disorders, the search
terms added were: (Anx* OR obsessive-compulsive
OR post-traumatic OR panic OR social phobia OR
social anxiety OR phob*OR GAD OR OCD OR PTSD
OR SAD). For depression, the search terms added
were: (depression OR depress*). For psychosis the
search terms added were: (Delus*OR Hallucinat* OR
Psychosis
OR
Psychotic
OR
Schizophren*
OR
Schizotyp* OR Bipolar OR Mania OR Manic). For sub-
stance disorders, the search terms added were: (sub-
stance disorder OR substance abuse OR substance
OR abuse OR cannabis OR tobacco OR alcohol OR
amphetamine OR hallucinogens OR heroin). For eating
disorders, the search terms added were: AND (anor-
exia nervosa OR bulimia nervosa OR eating disorders
OR binge eating). For sleep disorders, the added
terms were: (insomnia OR sleep OR nightmares OR cir-
cadian). For sexual disorders, the added search terms
were: (sexual OR orgasm OR desire OR erectile OR
ejaculation OR dyspareunia). Titles and abstracts
were read, and, if appropriate, the whole paper, in
order to determine whether the inclusion and exclu-
sion criteria were met.
Results
A total of 1096 studies were identified from the litera-
ture searches, of which 285 met the review inclusion
criteria. Summaries of the searches by each of the dis-
order types are displayed in the online Supplementary
Figs S1–S7. Descriptions of the individual VR studies
are available in the online Supplementary Tables S1–
S7. The most common reason for an empirical study
to be excluded from review was the use of non-
immersive technology (e.g. participants simply viewed
a standard computer screen for presentation) or empir-
ical data were not reported.
Anxiety disorders
Overwhelmingly, VR studies have concerned the treat-
ment
of
anxiety
disorders
(n = 127
intervention
reports). Even the assessment studies (n = 46) have
mainly been conducted for the purpose of validating
VR environments for treatment. The use of VR to
investigate the causes of anxiety has been more rarely
conducted (n = 19). The focus of the treatment studies
has typically been on specific phobias (e.g. Rothbaum
et al. 2000; Emmelkamp et al. 2002; Garcia-Palacios
et al. 2002; Botella et al. 2004) or social anxiety (e.g.
Anderson et al. 2013; Bouchard et al. 2016) or post-
traumatic stress disorder (e.g. Difede et al. 2007;
Rizzo et al. 2009), with many fewer investigations for
obsessive– compulsive disorder (OCD), which is sur-
prising given that treatment often requires change in
fears about external stimuli, and generalized anxiety

 disorder, which is less surprising given the internal
focus of the disorder. The principal intervention tech-
nique has been exposure, with a therapist present to
guide the person in most of the intervention studies.
The treatment studies have undoubtedly been pioneer-
ing in recognizing the potential for the technology in
this treatment area especially (e.g. Hodges et al. 1995;
Rothbaum et al. 1996; Botella et al. 1998). Case study
reports or small randomized controlled trials have
dominated the field. The quality of studies has too
often been low (Meyerbröker & Emmelkamp, 2010;
McCann et al. 2014). There are too few convincing ran-
domized controlled trials, although this is beginning to
change (e.g. Anderson et al. 2013; Bouchard et al. 2016;
Reger et al. 2016), too few experimental studies of
potential treatment mediators (e.g. Shiban et al. 2016),
and comparisons between different techniques have
typically been underpowered. Overall, however, VR
treatments seem to perform comparably in efficacy to
face-to-face equivalent interventions. With the caveat
concerning the quality of the studies, the treatment
efficacy has been shown in meta-analyses to be large
(e.g. Opriş et al. 2012), with evidence that the beneficial
effects transfer to the real world (Morina et al. 2015).
When long-term follow-ups have been included, treat-
ment
effects
for
these
short-term
therapies
have
strikingly been shown to persist over a number of
years (e.g. Rothbaum et al. 2002; Wiederhold &
Wiederhold, 2003). There are indications that drop-out
rates may be lower with VR treatments but that may
simply reflect a problem of quality control with
face-to-face therapy delivery. The range of VR-type
methods used has been wide, varying from large pro-
jection screens to the computer-assisted research envir-
onment (CAREN) system, in which the person has a
walking platform surrounded by a 360° display, to
CAVEs, flight simulators, and to HMDs. Not all
reports make clear which type of technology was
used. The greater the sense of presence in VR achieved
then the more likely anxiety will occur (Ling et al.
2014). The importance of sound in achieving presence
in VR should not be overlooked (e.g. Taffou et al.
2013). Detailed studies of how best to present stimuli
in VR are warranted but in our opinion have been
far too rare (e.g. Shiban et al. 2015).
Depression
Surprisingly, we identified only two studies that
clearly used immersive VR in relation to depression.
These feasibility studies tested out single treatment
techniques in small case series with no control condi-
tions (Shah et al. 2015; Falconer et al. 2016), with levels
of depression found to decrease with time. There have
also been two studies of (non-immersive) VR-type
tasks assessing spatial navigation memory in patients
with depression (e.g. Gould et al. 2007).
Psychosis
There have been 44 VR studies about schizophrenia
and related problems, with 23 concerning theory
development, 15 concerning assessment, and six test-
ing treatment. The types of VR studies here were prob-
ably the most heterogeneous compared with the other
mental health conditions, reflecting the complexity of
the clinical problem and the different perspectives
taken towards diagnosing and understanding psych-
osis. The studies have predominately used VR to assess
psychotic experiences in order to understand the
causes. VR has been of particular use in assessing para-
noia because the presentation of neutral social situa-
tions
enables
unfounded,
rather
than
genuine,
hostility to be detected. It is clear that VR can safely
assess psychotic experiences in patients with schizo-
phrenia and related diagnoses. Our group pioneered
the work on VR in relation to paranoia. We have
used VR to: assess paranoia (e.g. Freeman et al. 2003);
understand the individual characteristics predictive of
paranoia (e.g. Freeman et al. 2008); manipulate psycho-
logical factors in order to determine the causes of para-
noia (e.g. Freeman et al. 2014); and, most recently, treat
persecutory delusions in the context of schizophrenia
(Freeman et al. 2016). A rare use of VR to create a situ-
ation that cannot be achieved in real life is provided by
our manipulation of a person’s height in order to affect
self-esteem and hence paranoia (Freeman et al. 2014).
The small treatment study with 30 patients with perse-
cutory delusions showed that VR cognitive therapy is
potentially much more efficacious than VR exposure
therapy both in terms of reducing delusions and les-
sening distress in real-world situations. The controlled
effect size (d = 1.3) for VR cognitive therapy was large,
which is notable given that it was compared with
another credible treatment approach. VR has also
been used to study environmental factors that make
an impact on paranoia, by altering variables such as
population density and ethnicity (e.g. Valmaggia
et al. 2015; Veling et al. 2016). There is also a strand
of VR work assessing cognitive and social functioning
in schizophrenia (e.g. Sorkin et al. 2006) and conse-
quent intervention (e.g. Rus-Calafell et al. 2014).
Treatment studies are generally very few in number
and small in size but the results are very encouraging.
No studies related to mania were identified.
Substance disorders
VR has the potential to present individuals with simu-
lations of the cues that lead to the cravings that drive
subsequent problematic behaviours such as drug

 misuse, alcohol abuse or excessive gambling. There
have been 22 VR studies on substance disorders,
with 15 concerning assessment, five treatment, and
two theory development. The overwhelming majority
of the studies have simply shown that appropriate
VR environments can trigger cravings. Misuse of a
range of substances has been studied, including alco-
hol (e.g. Lee et al. 2008) and cocaine (e.g. Saladin
et al. 2006). However, the majority of the work has con-
cerned smoking (e.g. Bordnick et al. 2005) and it is evi-
dent
that
VR
environments
can
produce
strong
cravings for cigarettes (Pericot-Valverde et al. 2016).
The elicitation of cravings means that VR has the
potential to be successfully used in treatment, though
this
has
not
yet
been
rigorously
demonstrated.
Uncontrolled studies do indicate that VR might be
able to help reduce cravings for cigarette smoking (e.
g. Pericot-Valverde et al. 2014). Even crushing virtual
cigarettes has been found to be helpful when added
to standard treatment (Girard et al. 2009). For smoking
cessation, a randomized controlled trial testing cogni-
tive–behavioural therapy (CBT) with VR cue exposure
is underway (Giovancarli et al. 2016).
Eating disorders
There are a number of obvious mechanistic targets for
VR in the treatment of eating disorders: reducing food
cravings, improving body image, and enhancing emo-
tion regulation skills. A total of 18 empirical studies
were identified, 10 concerning treatment, seven assess-
ment, and one theory development. Despite an early
use of VR for eating disorders (e.g. Riva, 1998), it has
been recognized that the field has very few methodo-
logically strong studies (Riva, 2011; Ferrer-García &
Gutiérrez-Maldonado, 2012). Suitable VR environ-
ments can bring on food cravings (e.g. Ferrer-García
et al. 2015), with responses to VR food comparable
with real food (Gorini et al. 2010), and there has even
been an initial test of high-calorie food presented using
augmented reality (Pallavicini et al. 2016). The prelimin-
arytrialevidenceisthatVRtechniquesaddedtostandard
CBT help to improve body image (Riva et al. 2003; Cesa
et al. 2013; Marco et al. 2013). In an intriguing VR experi-
mental study, Keizer et al. (2016) helped patients with
anorexia nervosa to experience ownership of a healthy-
body mass index (BMI) body, which led afterwards, for
at least 2 h, to a reduction in body size overestimation.
New research onunderstandingthe bodyownershipillu-
sion in VR is likely to enhance eating disorder treatments
(Normand et al. 2011; Maselli & Slater, 2013).
Additional disorders
VR could have potential uses in the understanding and
treatment
of
sexual
disorders
concerning
desire,
arousal and orgasm. This work has not been carried
out. The literature search revealed four reports describ-
ing a series of uncontrolled studies in which a form of
psychodynamic therapy for erectile dysfunction or pre-
mature ejaculation included a VR element (e.g. Optale
et al. 2003). Another notable area is sleep disorder,
which is very common in the general population, but
VR has not been used to study causes or treatments.
Three studies have used a VR paradigm (road cross-
ing) to assess the adverse effects of sleep disorders
for the daytime safety of children (e.g. Avis et al. 2014).
Discussion
We conclude from the early studies that VR environ-
ments can elicit psychiatric symptoms, manipulation
of VR can inform the understanding of disorders,
and simpler psychological treatments can be success-
fully administered in VR. This is highly encouraging
for the future application of VR to mental health.
However, our inspection of the older literature warns
that the technology of VR is not an answer in and of
itself: the content delivered will matter for outcomes
(e.g. Freeman et al. 2016; Reger et al. 2016). Across a
breadth of disorders there are instances of real innova-
tions in the interaction between the technology and
insights into mental health problems. This has largely
been unheralded, perhaps because the methodological
quality has been limited and the potential for wider
dissemination hitherto constrained. The studies have
typically been small, negative results are less likely to
have been reported, and, in most places, the literature
has been distinctly piecemeal. Progress has been
understandably slow because hardware and software
have been expensive and expertise limited. This is
about to change (Wiederhold, 2016).
The gaps in the literature are astonishingly large.
This technology has simply not been applied enough
to
mental
health.
Psychiatric
symptoms
can
be
assessed in VR, but robust tests of reliability and valid-
ity have been very few; compared with retrospective
self-report, VR has the potential to prove a ‘gold stand-
ard’ assessment method for many mental health pro-
blems but this has not remotely been tested. VR has
been used to develop the understanding of too few dis-
orders, although even when used as an investigative
tool it has principally been used to assess symptoms
rather than provide firmer causal conclusions via
manipulation
tests
(Cook
&
Campbell,
1979).
Treatment trials have been small in size, rarely pre-
registered, and seldom conducted to the standards
now expected in clinical research. Of the range of treat-
ment techniques available it is the simpler ones, such
as exposure, that have been used. A therapist has
nearly
always
still
been
engaged

 interventions. Numerous other important treatment
techniques remain to be implemented in VR, especially
for more complex disorders. There is an intriguing pro-
gramme of research to be conducted concerning the
degree to which therapies can be delivered without a
therapist present for each type of presenting problem,
and whether avatars can compensate for the important
human presence fundamental to traditional psycho-
logical interventions. Many common disorders, for
example, depression, have barely received any VR
research attention. VR also has obvious, but untested,
use in psychiatric settings such as hospital wards or
forensic units where contact with the outside world
is highly restricted.
We believe that there are three overarching treat-
ment questions that need to be addressed: (1) What
is the best way to immerse individuals in VR so that
learning most readily transfers to the real world, balan-
cing the need to use affordable equipment? (2) Can key
theory-driven
psychological
treatment
techniques
(beyond simple exposure) be successfully delivered in
VR? (3) Do engaging, personalized, theory-driven
treatments implemented in affordable VR, with limited
use of clinicians, produce large real-world benefits for
patients? This work will need to be carried out with the
user experience put at the centre of design. Given its
use in gaming, VR could be made a highly appealing
treatment approach for patients. There is also the
issue of how related technologies, notably augmented
reality and wearable devices, could dovetail with the
new approaches.
Our review offers, perhaps, a glimpse of the future
of mental health care. It is, however, still relatively
early days with VR for mental health: scenarios are
limited, as is the degree of social interaction, for
example conversation, that is possible. Specialist pro-
gramming expertise is still required to create suitable
environments that lead to presence. Simulator sickness
may occur in poorly realized scenarios and systems.
Multi-sensory presentation of stimuli is most likely to
induce presence, but generalized touch feedback, that
is tactile stimulation on any part of the body contin-
gent on collision with a virtual object, is not feasible
at present. Thepotential therapeuticpowerofbodyown-
ership manipulation remains confined to specialist
laboratories. But the technology is developing fast: these
are likely to be short-term concerns. Psychological
research and clinical practice have made huge strides in
recent years too (Layard & Clark, 2015). We now have a
much clearer picture of which therapeutic techniques
are most effective, but suitably trained therapists are in
short supply, and quality control remains a concern. VR
and related technologies could help in solving this prob-
lem,makingthebesttherapyavailabletomanymorepeo-
ple. Yet the power of VR is such that it promises much
more than an improved delivery method for psycho-
logical therapies. VR allows us to try things that are not
easily practical in the real world. That means it could
potentially generate the kind of results that even a course
ofstandard treatment couldnot produce. ‘Revolutionary’

actually be justified over the coming years.
