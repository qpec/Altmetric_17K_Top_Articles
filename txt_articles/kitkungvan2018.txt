ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND Recent studies reported left ventricular (LV) fibrosis in patients with primary mitral regurgitation (MR)
thought to be principally due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP).
OBJECTIVES This study sought to evaluate the prevalence, characteristics, and prognostic implications of LV fibrosis in
a large cohort of primary MR patients with and without MVP using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR).
METHODS Patients referred for contrast CMR assessment of chronic primary MR were enrolled and underwent
comprehensive assessment of cardiac remodeling, severity of MR, and LV replacement fibrosis. Primary MR patients were
stratified into: an MVP group if there was >2 mm mitral leaflet displacement on cine-CMR, or a non-MVP group.
Patients were followed for arrhythmic events (sudden cardiac death, aborted sudden cardiac arrest, and sustained or
inducible ventricular arrhythmia).
RESULTS A total of 356 primary MR patients (177 MVP and 179 non-MVP) were enrolled. LV fibrosis was more prevalent
in the MVP group than the non-MVP group (36.7% vs. 6.7%; p < 0.001). The presence of MVP had the strongest
association (odds ratio: 6.82; p < 0.001) with LV fibrosis even after adjustment for clinical variables, measures of cardiac
remodeling, and MR severity. During follow-up (median 1,354 days), MVP patients with LV fibrosis had the highest event
rate for arrhythmic events.
CONCLUSIONS In primary MR patients, LV fibrosis is more prevalent in MVP than non-MVP, suggesting a unique
pathophysiology beyond volume overload in MVP. LV fibrosis in primary MR may represent a risk marker of arrhythmic
events. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2018;72:823–34) © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier on behalf of the American

 autopsies have confirmed that, in response to
progressive cardiac remodeling from chronic
MR, myocardial fibrosis can develop (2,3).
Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR)
has a unique ability to evaluate regional
myocardial replacement fibrosis by detecting
late
gadolinium
enhancement
(LGE)
(4).
The
presence
and extent of
replacement
fibrosis by LGE has been shown to relate to
adverse clinical outcomes and ventricular
arrhythmias in patients with coronary artery
disease (CAD) and nonischemic cardiomyop-
athies (5–9). Additionally, myocardial fibrosis
has been implicated as a potential arrhythmic
substrate in these patients (10,11).
Replacement fibrosis, as evidenced by LGE-CMR,
has been previously reported in a small series of
subjects with primary MR, particularly in patients
with mitral valve prolapse (MVP) (3,12,13). A recent
study by Basso et al. (14) demonstrated a high prev-
alence (88%) of myocardial fibrosis in the inferobasal
wall on autopsy of young adults with MVP who
experienced sudden cardiac death.
The objectives of this study were to: 1) better
characterize the prevalence and characteristics of
myocardial replacement fibrosis in a large cohort of
patients with chronic primary MR using LGE-CMR; 2)
elucidate whether replacement fibrosis was uniquely
associated with MVP or simply a consequence of
volume-overload mediated LV remodeling in chronic
primary MR, by comparing patients with MVP to a
group of patients with primary MR from etiology
other than MVP; and 3) evaluate the prognostic im-
plications of replacement fibrosis in primary MR pa-
tients with regard to arrhythmic events.
METHODS
PATIENT
SELECTION. We
prospectively
enrolled
patients
undergoing
a
clinical
contrast
CMR
for
assessment of chronic MR at the Houston Methodist
Hospital (Houston, Texas) from 2009 to 2014. The
typical indication for CMR was assessment of MR
severity or cardiac remodeling. A research nurse or
advanced cardiac imaging fellow performed a thor-
ough patient interview and/or review of medical
records to record baseline medical history and to
exclude patients with any clinical history of con-
founding causes of LV fibrosis: 1) CAD; 2) cardiomy-
opathy; 3) infiltrative disease (i.e., amyloidosis or
sarcoidosis); or 4) prior cardiac surgery. To avoid
ambiguity regarding confounding etiologies of any LV
fibrosis detected on LGE-CMR, we also excluded
patients with the following findings on imaging: 1) LV
ejection fraction (EF) <50%; 2) greater than mild
concentric LV hypertrophy (LV wall thickness >1.3 cm
and relative wall thickness >0.42) (15); or 3) coexist-
ing other primary valvular disease that was moderate
or greater in severity (except for tricuspid regurgita-
tion that was deemed secondary to MR). By their
inherent nature, the aforementioned criteria also
excluded patients with secondary MR, thus leaving
only primary MR patients in the study population.
Patients with acute MR were not enrolled as they
typically do not undergo CMR. The patient enroll-
ment process is summarized in Figure 1. The study
was
approved
by
the
institutional
review
board
at Houston Methodist Research Institute, and all
patients gave written informed consent.
The primary MR study population was further
stratified into MVP or non-MVP cohorts per criteria
reported by Han et al. (12). The criteria for diagnosis
of MVP by CMR was defined as >2-mm displacement
of any mitral valve scallop into the left atrium, as
indicated on a 3-chamber view (12). An attempt was
made to determine the etiology of primary MR in the
non-MVP cohort using available medical history and
the results of available diagnostic testing, including
CMR findings.
CMR STUDY PROTOCOL. CMR images were acquired
using either 1.5- or 3.0-T clinical scanners (Siemens
Avanto and Verio, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany) with
phased-array coil systems. A CMR examination for
mitral valve assessment began with cine-CMR for
anatomic and functional assessment in a short-axis
stack, and standard 2-, 3-, and 4-chamber views
using a steady-state free-precession sequence with
typical flip angle of 65� to 85�; repetition time of
3.0 ms; echo time of 1.3 ms; in-plane spatial resolu-
tion of 1.7 to 2.0 mm � 1.4 to 1.6 mm; slice thickness of
6 mm, with 4 mm interslice gap; and temporal reso-
lution of 35 to 40 ms. A high resolution, small field of
view cine-CMR of the mitral valve scallops (described
in the following text) was used to evaluate mecha-
nism
of
MR
using
steady-state
free-precession
sequence with typical flip angle of 45� to 85�, repeti-
tion time of 3.0 ms, echo time of 1.3 ms, reconstructed
in-plane spatial resolution of 0.6 � 0.6 mm, slice
thickness of 4 to 5 mm, and temporal resolution of
w25 ms. Standard LGE-CMR was used for assessment
of replacement fibrosis using a magnitude and phase-
sensitive
segmented
inversion-recovery
sequence
approximately 10 min after intravenous gadolinium
contrast
administration
(gadopentetate
dimeglu-
mine, 0.15 mmol/kg) with in-plane spatial resolution

 of 1.8 � 1.3 mm and slice thickness of 6 mm, with
inversion
time
adjusted
to
null
normal
viable
myocardium (4). Cine- and LGE-CMR images were
obtained in matching short- and long-axis planes.
Short-axis images were acquired every 10 mm along
the
entire
left
ventricle.
Long-axis
images
were
obtained
in
standard
2-,
3-,
and
4-chamber
orientations.
CMR IMAGES ANALYSIS. LV and right ventricular
(RV) volumes were measured by planimetry of the
endocardial borders, on a stack of short-axis images
acquired from cine-CMR covering both ventricles
from base to apex. Papillary muscles and trabeculae
were excluded from blood volume (16). LV end-
diastolic
volume
(EDV),
LV
end-systolic
volume
(ESV), RV EDV, and RV ESV were calculated by sum-
mation of these images (16). The stroke volume for
each ventricle was determined by subtracting the ESV
from the EDV. The LVEF and RVEF were calculated by
dividing
the
stroke
volume
by
the
EDV
of
the
respective ventricle.
The mechanism of MR was assessed by evaluating
the cine-CMR images that were acquired in standard
2-, 3-, and 4-chamber, as well as a stack of high res-
olution cine-CMR images in “en-face” views of the
mitral valve and a stack of 3-chamber views perpen-
dicular to the short axis of the valve to completely
visualize all individual mitral scallops (A1 to P1, A2 to
P2, and A3 to P3) (12). Mitral regurgitant volume was
calculated as the difference between LV stroke vol-
ume and aortic forward stroke volume (3,17). Mitral
regurgitant fraction was calculated from the ratio
(percentage) of mitral regurgitant volume divided by
LV stroke volume or mitral inflow stroke volume
when aortic regurgitation is present (3,17).
The presence and extent of replacement fibrosis, as
demonstrated
by
LGE,
was
assessed
in
all
LV
segments according to the American College of Car-
diology/American Heart Association 17-myocardial-
segment model by a consensus of 2 readers with
COCATS level III training in CMR (D.K. and D.J.S.)
who were blinded to clinical history and other imag-
ining information (16). To mitigate the effect of im-
aging
artifacts,
replacement
fibrosis
was
only
considered present if it was visually identified on 2
contiguous or orthogonal slices and seen on both
magnitude and phase-sensitive image reconstruction
(16).
The
transmural
extent
of
LGE
in
each
LV
segment was defined and scored as 0 for no LGE
detected, 1 for 1% to 25%, 2 for 26% to 50%, 3 for 51%
to 75%, and 4 for 76% to 100% (16). Our previously
described
semiquantitative
method
was
used
to
rapidly calculate burden of replacement fibrosis (as a
percentage
of
the
left
ventricle)
by
summing
segmental scores, weighted by the midpoint of the
range of LGE, and dividing by the total number of LV
regions (18). Patterns of replacement fibrosis were
classified based on previously published criteria: 1)
midwall
striae;
2)
patchy;
or
3)
subendocardial
(Figure 2) (8). To focus on the association of MVP and
LV replacement fibrosis, as well as to minimize other
confounders, we ignored LGE isolated to RV insertion
sites, as it could be present in pulmonary hyperten-
sion and RV remodeling that are consequences of
severe MR (8). In addition, LGE at the RV insertion
site is prone to several imaging artifacts, such as
partial volume effect and ghosting artifacts, that can
lead to overestimation of myocardial fibrosis preva-
lence (19).
FOLLOW-UP
AND
ARRHYTHMIC
EVENTS. Clinical
follow-up was initiated from the time of CMR imag-
ing. Event data were gathered from medical record
review; telephone interviews with the patients, rela-
tives, and/or their health care providers; and the
social security death index database. Patients were
followed for arrhythmic events that comprised of
sudden cardiac death, aborted sudden cardiac arrest,
and symptomatic sustained or inducible ventricular

 arrhythmia (ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation)
requiring placement of an implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (20). The event status for all patients
was checked until February 15, 2018. For ascertain-
ment of adverse clinical events, patient data were
presented to an adjudication committee consisting of
2 cardiologists blinded to imaging data.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Baseline characteristics of
primary MR patients were summarized according to
the presence or absence of MVP and replacement
fibrosis. All data were presented as mean � SD for
continuous variables, median and interquartile range
for skewed continuous variables, or number and
percentage for categorical variables. Chi-square or
Fisher exact tests (categorical variables) and Stu-
dent’s t-test (continuous variables) were used to
compare subjects. Univariate and multivariate logis-
tic regression models were used to examine associa-
tion between clinical or imaging variables and the
presence of replacement fibrosis. The multivariate
model included variables selected from backward
elimination, with a significance level of 0.05. The full
model included all statistically significant variables
in the univariate models. Cochran’s test was used to
assess equality of proportions in different locations of
the left ventricle where replacement fibrosis was
present. Univariate cox proportional hazards model
was used to determine association between variables
and arrhythmic events. All analyses were performed
with STATA version 15 (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Texas). Statistical significance was defined as 2-tailed
p < 0.05 for all tests.
RESULTS
STUDY POPULATION. A total of 705 patients referred
for assessment of chronic MR were enrolled. After
excluding imaging findings that could represent po-
tential confounding etiologies of fibrosis and sec-
ondary MR, 356 patients with primary MR remained
and comprised the study population (Figure 1). Base-
line characteristics of the study population are shown
in Table 1. Of these, 51.7% were men, and the mean
age was 61.9 � 14.3 years. MVP was found in 177
patients (49.7%), with posterior mitral leaflet pro-
lapse being the most commonly involved leaflet
(n ¼ 100, 28.1%). Etiologies for MR in the non-MVP
cohort (n ¼ 179, 50.3%) included calcified and/or
thickened mitral leaflets (n ¼ 96, 27.0%), prior infec-
tive endocarditis (n ¼ 12, 3.4%), rheumatic MR (n ¼ 9,
2.5%), and indeterminate (n ¼ 62, 17.4%).
COMPARISON OF MVP VERSUS NON-MVP COHORTS. Com-
parison of clinical characteristics and CMR findings
between the 2 cohorts are shown in Table 1. There was a
higher proportion of men in the MVP cohort, whereas
other cardiovascular disease risk factors, including
diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension, were
more frequent in the non-MVP cohort. Patients with
MVP had greater LV mass, LV and RV volumes, and
left atrial volumes, as well as more severe MR
compared with non-MVP patients. LV systolic function
was not significantly different between both cohorts.
REPLACEMENT FIBROSIS AS DETECTED BY LGE. Overall,
LV replacement fibrosis, as evidenced by LGE, was
present in 77 patients (21.6%). Most of the patients

 had LV fibrosis in non–CAD related patterns, in which
midwall striae was the most common pattern (n ¼ 45,
12.6%), followed by patchy pattern (n ¼ 29, 8.1%).
Among the 3 patients (0.8%) with a subendocardial
pattern of fibrosis, obstructive CAD was excluded (by
coronary angiogram in 2 patients and inferred in 1
patient by a normal stress myocardial perfusion
imaging
study).
The
majority
of
patients
with
replacement fibrosis (79.2%) had #2 LV segments
involved,
with
an
average
replacement
fibrosis
burden of 2.2 � 0.9% of the left ventricle.
Replacement fibrosis was more prevalent in pa-
tients with MVP than in those without (36.7% vs.
6.7%; p < 0.001). The distribution of LV replacement
fibrosis
is
shown
in
Figure
3.
In
MVP
patients,
replacement fibrosis in non-CAD related patterns
(midwall
striae
or
patchy
pattern)
was
most
commonly
found
in
the
basal
inferolateral
wall
(31.1%) followed by the basal inferior wall (10.7%).
Based on chi-square and Cochran’s test for equality
of proportions, the prevalence of replacement fibrosis
in the basal or mid inferolateral wall, basal inferior
wall, and basal inferoseptum was significantly higher
in MVP than non-MVP patients (Figure 3). MVP pa-
tients
had
a
greater
prevalence
of
replacement
fibrosis than non-MVP patients at all levels of mitral
regurgitant
fraction
and
LVEDV
index
(Central
Illustration). The greater prevalence of replacement
fibrosis among patients with MVP was more pro-
nounced specifically in the basal or mid inferolateral
wall or basal inferior wall, which are the segments
adjacent
to
the
posteromedial
papillary
muscle
(32.8% vs. 1.1%; p < 0.001). MVP was found in 58 of
60 patients who had replacement fibrosis in the
segments adjacent to the posteromedial papillary
muscle (96.7%).
On univariate analysis, multiple clinical and im-
aging
markers

However, on multivariate analysis, only age, LVEF,

significantly associated with replacement fibrosis.

In patients with MVP, replacement fibrosis was found most commonly in the basal inferolateral wall (31.1%), whereas in non-MVP patients, it
was most commonly present at the basal anteroseptum (3.4%). Replacement fibrosis in the segments adjacent to the posteromedial papillary
muscle (the basal or mid inferolateral wall or basal inferior wall) is more prevalent in MVP than non-MVP patients. *Statistical significance

ARRHYTHMIC EVENTS. During the follow-up period
(median
1,354
days;
interquartile
range:
668
to
1,792 days), 96 patients (27.0%) underwent mitral
valve surgery (72 patients in MVP cohort and 24 pa-
tients in non-MVP cohort), the majority of whom had
mitral valve repair (n ¼ 80, 83.3%). Arrhythmic events
occurred in 9 patients (2.5%), including 8 patients
(4.5%) in the MVP cohort and 1 patient in the non-MVP
cohort (0.6%). Replacement fibrosis was present in 5 of
the
8
arrhythmic
patients
with
MVP
and
the
1
arrhythmic patient without MVP (Table 4). The highest
arrhythmic event rate was seen in MVP patients
with replacement fibrosis (7.7%), followed by MVP
patients
without replacement
fibrosis (2.7%)
and
non-MVP patients (0.6%; p < 0.01). Replacement
fibrosis and MVP were the only factors that were
associated with arrhythmic events (Table 5). Due to the
small number of events, multivariable analysis of
factors associated with arrhythmic events could not
be performed.
DISCUSSION
PREVALENCE AND CHARACTERISTICS OF REPLACEMENT
FIBROSIS WITHIN PATIENTS WITH PRIMARY MR. In our
large primary MR cohort, a higher prevalence of
regional replacement fibrosis was observed in pa-
tients
with
MVP
compared
with
those
without
(36.7% vs. 6.7%; p < 0.001), particularly in the seg-
ments adjacent to the posteromedial papillary mus-
cle. The replacement fibrosis identified in primary
MR was typically small in extent, occurring in mid-
wall striae or patchy patterns that differ from pat-
terns
associated
with
CAD
(subendocardial
or
transmural) (16). In addition, MVP had the strongest
independent association with presence of regional
replacement fibrosis, particularly in the segments
adjacent to the posterior papillary muscle, as deter-
mined
by
multivariate
analysis
and
a
step-wise
model adjusting for both clinical and imaging vari-
ables. Previous studies with smaller sample sizes of
patients with chronic, asymptomatic moderate, or
severe primary MR have also demonstrated a sur-
prisingly high prevalence of LV replacement fibrosis
(3,13). However, in those studies, it is difficult to
ascertain if LV fibrosis was truly associated with

 MVP or was a consequence of MR and LV remodel-
ing. More recently, Basso et al. (14) reported that
88% of young adults with MVP and no evidence of
significant
MR
who
experienced
sudden
cardiac
death had histological evidence of LV fibrosis in the
inferobasal wall. While their prevalence rates might
be affected by selection bias (patients experiencing
sudden cardiac death), these data support our find-
ings of an association among MVP, the development
of regional LV fibrosis, and risk of arrhythmias. In
contrast, as the current study enrolled living pa-
tients who were referred for CMR to assess chronic
MR, our data may be more reflective of the preva-
lence of replacement fibrosis in MVP patients who
are seen in clinical practice.
POSSIBLE
MECHANISMS
FOR
LV
REPLACEMENT
FIBROSIS IN MVP. Although MR creates chronic vol-
ume overload in both MVP and non-MVP patients, our
findings indicate regional LV fibrosis occurs more
frequently in MVP patients. Furthermore, our data
have shown a significant relationship between MVP
and replacement fibrosis despite adjusting for other
variables. These finding suggest that a distinct MVP
pathophysiology beyond MR or LV remodeling alone
is likely to be responsible for these unique regional
fibrotic changes. In patients with MVP, redundant
and billowing of the mitral leaflets and elongated
chordal apparatus, along with a dilated and flattened
mitral annulus, create a complex interaction between
these structures and the left ventricle (21–26). During
systole, a rapid recurring force from mitral closure
transmitted to the choral apparatus and papillary
muscle results in abnormal traction and excursion of
the papillary muscle (22,27). In patients with MVP,
while the mitral annulus moves toward the LV apex at
peak systole, the papillary muscle tip tends to move
in the opposite direction, toward mitral annulus,
resulting in increased papillary muscle excursion
(22,27). On the other hand, in the non-MVP patients,
the papillary muscle excursion is very minimal, sug-
gesting a synchronized movement of mitral annulus
and papillary muscle tip. This observation has been
demonstrated in echocardiographic and CMR studies,
as well as in vitro models (22,27). The repetitive
traction in the papillary muscle, along with impair-
ment of mitral annular geometry and motion, thus
creates a mechanical stretch that transmits to the
adjacent myocardium, the basal inferolateral wall,
and its adjacent LV segments (24–26,28,29). As a
consequence and a response to recurring mechanical
stretch,
myocardial
hypertrophy
and
eventually
fibrosis may occur in this region (26,28). The chro-
nicity of MVP, exposing a patient to more repetitive
myocardial insult, is likely to play a role in the
development of myocardial fibrosis, as suggested by
the fact that age and greater severity of MR were
independently
associated
with
the
presence
of
replacement fibrosis.
MVP AND ARRHYTHMIC EVENTS. The estimated rate
of sudden cardiac death in patients with MVP is 0.2%
to 0.4% per year, with the cause of death attributed
to malignant ventricular arrhythmia (30). Different
mechanisms
of
ventricular
arrhythmia
in
MVP
patients have been proposed, including excessive
traction of papillary muscles, endocardial friction
lesions that extended into myocardium, and extrav-
alvular abnormalities, such as autonomic nervous
system or conduction system dysfunction (14,31,32).
Despite limitation of statistical evaluation due to a
small number of adverse events, the results of our
study suggest a relationship between myocardial
fibrosis
and
ventricular
arrhythmia.
During
the
follow-up period, patients with MVP and replace-
ment fibrosis had the highest arrhythmic events
when compared with MVP patients without replace-
ment fibrosis or to non-MVP patients (who had a low
rate of replacement fibrosis in general). Recently, in
line with our data, Basso et al. (14) reported histo-
pathological
and
CMR
evidence
of
myocardial
fibrosis, particularly in the inferobasal wall, that
could represent an arrhythmic substrate in patients
with
MVP.
In
their
study,
patients
with
MVP
and complex ventricular arrhythmias had a higher
prevalence
of
LGE
in
the
inferobasal
wall
than
those without ventricular arrhythmias (73% vs. 7%;
p < 0.001) (14). Several prior studies have shown
that myocardial fibrosis could potentially represent

STUDY
LIMITATIONS. Despite
utilizing
a
careful
study design, the patients enrolled in our cohort did
not routinely undergo specific testing to rule out
other possible causes of myocardial fibrosis (i.e.,
coronary angiography). However, clinical history and
available diagnostic testing results were thoroughly
evaluated to minimize confounding factors. In addi-
tion, evaluation of replacement fibrosis in our study
was limited to the myocardium and did not include
the papillary muscles. We are aware of the prior
reports
demonstrating
increased
prevalence
of
fibrosis in papillary muscles in patients with MVP
(12,14,22).
However,
in
routine
clinical
practice,
evaluation of papillary muscle fibrosis has certain
limitations. Although standard LGE-CMR used in our
study is well validated and widely used for detection
of myocardial LGE, its diagnostic performance for
detection of papillary muscle LGE is limited. In a
study by Han et al. (12), only 50% of patients who had
papillary muscle LGE, identified by high-resolution 3-
dimensional LGE, were detected by standard LGE-
CMR (12). High signal intensity of the blood cavity
adjacent
to
the
papillary
muscle
interferes
with
identification of small papillary muscle LGE. For
optimal identification of papillary muscle fibrosis, we
believe
high-resolution,
dark-blood
LGE-CMR
is
required, and this technique was not available at the
time of this study. Although our study represents one
of the largest experiences with contemporary LGE-
CMR in patients with MVP to date, our cohort was
from a single center, and the relatively small number
of clinical events resulted in statistical limitations.
Furthermore,
valvular
patients
are
frequently
referred to CMR as a second-line test to address spe-
cific questions (e.g., severity of regurgitation). Hence,
referral biases may affect the prevalence of disease,
comorbidities, and adverse clinical events in the pa-
tients in this study. As a consequence, extrapolating
our results on adverse clinical events to the general
population with MVP should be done with caution.
Nonetheless, our data suggest an important patho-
physiological link among MVP, myocardial fibrosis,
and arrhythmic risk. We are aware of certain distinct
characteristics
of
MVP,
such
as
mitral
annular
disjunction and systolic curling, and their association
with myocardial fibrosis (28). However, the associa-
tion of these features and myocardial fibrosis was not
the primary objective and were not evaluated in the
current study. Future multicenter studies with a
larger study population may be required to further
validate
our
findings
and,
more
importantly,

CONCLUSIONS
Our study demonstrates that patients with MVP have
increased regional LV replacement fibrosis, as detec-
ted by LGE-CMR, particularly in the segments adja-
cent to the posteromedial papillary muscle. This may
be due to a unique complex valvular pathophysiology
involving
the
mitral
leaflets,
chordal
apparatus,
papillary muscles, and left ventricle. The presence of
replacement
fibrosis
may
be
further
related
to
increased symptomatic ventricular arrhythmic events
in patients with MVP. Future studies are warranted to
confirm the clinical significance of regional replace-
ment fibrosis in patients with MVP and further iden-
tify patients who are at high risk for cardiac events.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Patients with
MVP often develop regional LV myocardial fibrosis adjacent to
the posteromedial papillary muscle, and this may mediate
ventricular arrhythmic events.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: Future studies are needed to
confirm the clinical significance of regional fibrosis in patients
with MVP and identify those who are at highest risk of arrhythmic
events.
