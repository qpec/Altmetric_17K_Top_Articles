AbstrACt
background Multimorbidity, the presence of two or 
more non-communicable diseases (NCD), is a costly 
and complex challenge for health systems globally. 
Patients with NCDs incur high levels of out-of-pocket 
expenditure (OOPE), often on medicines, but the literature 
on the association between OOPE on medicines and 
multimorbidity has not been examined systematically.
Methods A systematic review was conducted via 
searching medical and economics databases including 
Ovid Medline, EMBASE, EconLit, Cochrane Library and the 
WHO Global Health Library from year 2000 to 2016. Study 
quality was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. 
PROSPERO: CRD42016053538.
Findings 14 articles met inclusion criteria. Findings 
indicated that multimorbidity was associated with higher 
OOPE on medicines. When number of NCDs increased from 
0 to 1, 2 and ≥3, annual OOPE on medicines increased 
by an average of 2.7 times, 5.2 times and 10.1 times, 
respectively. When number of NCDs increased from 0 
to 1, 2, ≥2 and ≥3, individuals spent a median of 0.36% 
(IQR 0.15%–0.51%), 1.15% (IQR 0.62%–1.64%), 1.41% 
(IQR 0.86%–2.15%), 2.42% (IQR 2.05%–2.64%) and 
2.63% (IQR 1.56%–4.13%) of mean annual household 
net adjusted disposable income per capita, respectively, 
on annual OOPE on medicines. More multimorbidities 
were associated with higher OOPE on medicines as a 
proportion of total healthcare expenditures by patients. 
Some evidence suggested that the elderly and low-income 
groups were most vulnerable to higher OOPE on medicines. 
With the same number of NCDs, certain combinations of 
NCDs yielded higher medicine OOPE. Non-adherence to 
medicines was a coping strategy for OOPE on medicines.
Conclusion Multimorbidity of NCDs is increasingly 
costly to healthcare systems and OOPE on medicines can 
severely compromise financial protection and universal 
health coverage. It is crucial to recognise the need for 
better equity and financial protection, and policymakers 
should consider health system financial options, cost 
sharing policies and service patterns for those with NCD 
multimorbidities.
IntroduCtIon
Non-communicable diseases (NCD) are the 
leading cause of morbidity and mortality 
globally.1 The United Nations and the World 
Health Organization(WHO) have established 
coordinated responses to address NCDs 
worldwide.2 3 A particular challenge with 
NCDs is multimorbidity, the presence of two 
or more NCDs.4 Patients with multimorbidity 
are disproportionately burdened with illness, 
and economically, due to complex needs and 
high healthcare utilisation.5 A study of six 
low-middle income countries (LMIC) found 
that the highest contribution to out-of-pocket 
expenditure (OOPE) in patients with multi-
morbidity was on medicine.6 Using nationally 
representative data, a study in the USA found 
that elderly patients with three or more NCDs 
Key questions
What is already known about this topic?
 
► Patients with multimorbidity are disproportionately 
financially burdened due to complex health needs 
and high healthcare utilisation.
 
► Medicines constitute the largest proportion of 
out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for patients with 
multimorbidity.
 
► Current health systems fail to provide sufficient 
financial protection for OOPE on medicines.
What are the new findings?
 
► There was an association between level of 
multimorbidity in patients and out-of-pocket 
expenditure (OOPE) on medicines. More 
multimorbidities were associated with higher OOPE 
on medicines as a proportion of total healthcare 
expenditures by patients.
 
► Even with the same number of non-communicable 
diseases (NCD), certain specific combinations 
of chronic conditions yielded higher OOPE on 
medicines.
 
► The elderly were more vulnerable to higher OOPE 
on medicines, while some evidence suggested 
medicine OOPE accounted for a greater proportion 
of income for low-income groups.
 
► In patients with multimorbidity, non-adherence 
was a coping strategy for OOPE on medicines, with 
adverse health consequences.

used five or more prescription drugs, revealing that 
medicines contributed to high healthcare expenditure 
by patients.7 
Given the scale of the healthcare and financial burden 
of NCDs, understanding the financial burden on patients 
with multimorbidity, particularly on medicines, is crucial 
when developing strategies towards universal health 
coverage (UHC), which aims to provide access to health 
services, including medicines, without financial hardship, 
and in order to ensure equity in financial protection.8 A 
review on the global impact on NCDs on impoverishment 
revealed that OOP medical expenditures drive house-
holds into financial catastrophe and impoverishments.5 
In many LMICs, health systems fail to protect individuals 
from OOPE on medicines due to inequitable financing, 
where insurance schemes or benefits packages do not 
cover all essential medicines, or patients have to incur 
substantial copayments.6 9 A study in rural India found 
medicines accounted for 49% of total aggregate OOPE 
for illnesses.10 Patients in developed countries also incur 
large OOPE for medicines. A 2003 survey of Medicare 
beneficiaries in the USA aged above  65 years showed that 
more than one-quarter had no prescription coverage, 
and almost half of low-income seniors in selected states 
lacked coverage for medicines.7 Inadequate insurance 
that covers inpatient and outpatient services but not costs 
of medicines is likely to worsen access to medicines.11
This review contributes to the existing literature by 
investigating evidence on the relationship between multi-
morbidities and OOPE on medicines. To date, existing 
reviews have only examined the overall economic 
burden of NCDs in countries, but not OOPE incurred 
by individuals.5 12 13 Other studies have investigated total 
OOPE on healthcare overall, but not on medicines 
alone specifically.14 15 To address this knowledge gap, we 
conducted a systematic review of published studies and 
synthesised current literature on OOPE on medicines by 
patients with NCD multimorbidities.
MetHodology
We followed the methods detailed in a peer-reviewed 
systematic review protocol that is registered with PROS-
PERO (registration CRD 42016053538). We system-
atically searched electronic databases (Ovid Medline, 
Cochrane Library, EconLIT, EMBASE, WHO Global 
Health Library) in January 2017 for articles published 
from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2016. We only 
included studies from year 2000 onwards to concentrate 
on recent relevant studies. Bibliographies of included 
articles were searched for additional articles that met 
inclusion criteria.
Search strategy involved keywords and Medical 
Subject Headings. Search strategies were tailored to 
each database. Online supplementary appendix pp 1–4 
describes detailed search strategies for each database. 
In summary, keywords used for identifying NCD multi-
morbidity included ‘Chronic disease’, ‘Chronic condi-
tion’, ‘Chronic illness’, ‘Multimorbid’, ‘Multimorbidity’ 
and ‘Non-communicable’; keywords for identifying 
medicines were ‘Prescription drug’, ‘Medicine’, ‘Drug’, 
‘Pharmaceutical’ and ‘Polypharmacy’; and keywords for 
identifying outcome measure of OOPE were ‘Out-of-
pocket’, ‘Financial’, ‘Utilisation’, ‘Health expenditures’, 
‘Health care cost’ and ‘Drug cost’.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Table 1 shows our detailed inclusion and exclusion 
criteria.
study selection
Two independent reviewers reviewed titles and abstracts. 
Subsequently, article full texts were screened for eligi-
bility. Any disagreements were resolved through consul-
tation with a third reviewer.
data extraction
Information extracted from articles included reference 
information, population and study settings, study design 
and data sources, key findings on relationship between 
OOPE for medicines and multimorbidity, and other 
secondary outcomes including medicine utilisation for 
multimorbidity, coping strategies for OOPE on medi-
cines and OOPE for other healthcare services.
Currency of ooPe
For comparability, all OOPE on medicines was converted 
to 2015 US$. This was done by using Purchasing Power 
Parity Indices to convert costs from one country to another 
(in this case, the USA), and subsequently the overall US 
Consumer Price Index (CPI) was used to convert histor-
ical costs to 2015 US$.16 17 If the year of OOPE was not 
specified in the article, we calculated OOPE based on 
Recommendations for policy
 
► It is crucial to recognise the need for better equity and financial 
protection, and policymakers should consider health system 
financial options, cost sharing policies and service patterns for 
those with NCD multimorbidities.
 
► Policymakers should move from a single-disease framework to 
one that takes into account multimorbidity, when allocating funds 
and when designing policies aimed at financial protection.
 
► Targeted government funding and support programmes should 
take into account multimorbidity status of individuals, particularly 
for the elderly and low-income groups who are most vulnerable to 
OOP hardships.
 
► Policy measures could include exemptions from certain costs for 
the elderly and low socioeconomic status groups, lower caps on 
copayments and subsidies for vital drugs. 
 
► Prescription drug cost sharing benefit plans must be designed to 
provide enhanced and broadened coverage for multimorbidities, 
particularly for certain NCD combinations.
 
► A crucial clinical implication relates to the need for better clinical 
prescription guidelines to prevent prescription of unessential 
medicines and generic drugs for chronic illness which may cause 
unwarranted expenditures on medicines by patients.

the year of data collection (eg, survey year). OOPE was 
reported to the nearest dollar.
Calculations of ooPe as a proportion of mean annual national 
average wages
All selected articles had results on OOPE on medicines, 
but a few did not clearly specify absolute amounts (eg, 
OOPE reported as percentage of income). Hence, we 
contacted authors of the latter subset of articles. As a 
result, we had absolute amounts of OOPE on medicines 
(for different numbers of multimorbidities) for 11 of 
our 14 included studies. One of these 11 of 14 studies 
reported absolute OOPE on medicines for last outpatient 
visit, and the remaining 10 of 14 studies reported abso-
lute annual OOPE on medicines.
We obtained annual national average wages (2015) 
(calculated by OECD: average wages are obtained by 
dividing the national-accounts-based total wage bill by 
the average number of employees in the total economy, 
which is then multiplied by the ratio of the average usual 
weekly hours per full-time employee to the average usual 
weekly hours for all employees) from the OECD,18 and 
mean annual household net disposable income per 
capita from OECD.19 Subsequently, using the 10 studies 
that reported annual OOPE on medicines, we calculated 
OOPE on medicines as a proportion of annual national 
average wages, and OOPE on medicines as a propor-
tion of mean annual household net adjusted dispos-
able income per capita, to allow comparability between 
settings and years.
Quality evaluation
The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) is a well-established 
quality assessment tool for observational studies,20 21 which 
we used to evaluate the quality of studies included in this 
review. We modified the tool to suit our specific purposes 
by designing questions directly addressing OOPE and 
NCDs (online supplementary appendix pp 5–6). We 
assessed quality of articles in three categories—popula-
tion selection, comparability and outcome measures. 
Under population selection, we assessed if population 
studied was nationally representative, how NCDs were 
measured (eg, self-reported) and how multimorbidi-
ties were classified (eg, 0 NCD, 1 NCD, 2–3 NCDs, 4–6

Study design
We included articles from the year 2000 to 31 Dec 2016, without any 
restriction on study design. We only included original primary studies 
published in peer-reviewed journals. Only studies in English were included.
We excluded reviews, commentaries, letters, 
issue briefs, editorials, poster presentations, or 
conference papers.
Populations and settings
We included articles without any restriction on populations and settings 
(ie, included low-middle income countries, developed countries, any age 
groups, etc).

Outcome: OOPE on medicines for multimorbidity
1. First, we ensured the type of expenditure studied in the article was 
OOPE borne by patients. We defined OOPE as spending that was not 
reimbursed, but directly incurred by the patient from their income, as 
a proportion of household expenditures, or from cost sharing from 
insurance. OOPE did not include expenditure on insurance premiums.
1. Articles not on OOPE were excluded: for 
example, articles on national healthcare spending, 
or expenditure by insurance companies, instead 
of OOPE by individuals.
2. Second, we ensured OOPE was for medicines. Medicines could be 
for treatment of chronic conditions, including prescription drugs, non-
prescription drugs, medications, pharmaceuticals, alternative medicines, 
and complementary medicines.
2. Articles that only studied total inpatient 
costs, or total outpatient costs, even though it 
incorporated costs of medicines, were excluded.
3. Thirdly, we ensured OOPE on medicines was compared for different 
numbers of multimorbidities. Articles must specify OOPE on medicines 
for different numbers of NCDs, or different combinations of NCDs that 
consisted of different numbers of NCDs. For example, article compares 
OOPE on medicines for 0, 1, 2–3, 4–6 NCDs, or article compares OOPE 
on medicines for diabetes (ie, 1 NCD) and diabetes with arthritis and 
depression (ie, 3 NCDs).
3. OOPE on medicines not studied in association 
with specific numbers of NCDs. For example, 
OOPE was studied in associated with Charlson-
comorbidity Index instead of number of NCDs.
OOPE, out-of-pocket expenditure.

NCDs). For comparability, we assessed if studies might 
have incurred bias as a result of study design and anal-
ysis. For outcome measures, we assessed if measurement 
of OOPE for medicines was reliable (eg, self-reported or 
verified with administrative data).
We measured six items in the NOS quality assessment 
tool: four items for population selection, one item for 
comparability, one item for outcome. A maximum of 1 
point can be awarded for each item. The NOS scale can 
have a maximum of 6 points total. A score was computed 
by adding the number of points. Studies were categorised 
into high (4–6 points), moderate (3 points) and satisfac-
tory (0–2 points) quality.
statistical methods
Due to considerable heterogeneity of studies for OOPE 
on medicines, meta-analysis of OOPE on medicines was 
precluded. We discussed our findings narratively and 
presented median and IQR of absolute OOPE on medi-
cines calculated from our included studies, stratified by 
number of NCDs.
In addition, for each study that provided absolute 
mean annual OOPE on medicines for different numbers 
of NCDs, we calculated the ratios of absolute mean 
annual OOPE on medicines across groups with different 
numbers of NCDs, relative to the group with the fewest 
NCDs, for comparability within studies. For example, for 
an article that reported absolute mean annual OOPE for 
0 NCD, 1–2 NCDs and ≥3 NCDs, we calculated the ratio of 
absolute mean annual OOPE on medicines for ≥3 NCDs 
to absolute mean OOPE on medicines to 0 NCD, as well 
as the ratio of absolute mean annual OOPE on medicines 
for 1–2 NCDs to absolute mean annual OOPE on medi-
cines for 0 NCD.
results
A total of 7340 records were identified from data-
base searches. After removing duplicates, there were 
6667 records, which were screened based on titles and 
abstracts. Of these, 209 full-text articles were assessed for 
eligibility. Figure 1 shows the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow chart. 
Fourteen primary articles met the eligibility criteria and 
were included in this review.22–35
Characteristics of included articles
Characteristics of the 14 selected studies are summarised 
in table 2.22–35 Eight of 14 articles were published between 
2011 and 2016, three between 2006 and 2010, and three 
between 2000 and 2005. Six studies were conducted in 
the USA, two in Canada, one in Australia, four in South 
Korea and one in India. All articles were observational. 
Three articles studied populations of all ages, four 
studied elderly populations ≥65 years and seven studied 
those aged between 18 and 64 years.
Thirteen of 14 articles studied multimorbidity based 
on number of NCDs, while the remaining one article 
studied specific combinations of NCDs. In general, 
articles studied OOPE on medicines for zero, one, two 
and three or more NCDs. The majority (11 of 14 papers) 
of studies referred to NCDs as ‘chronic conditions’ or 
‘medical conditions’. Two studies defined NCDs as condi-
tions that had lasted, or were expected to last, 12 or more 
months and resulted in functional limitations, and/or a 
need for ongoing medical care. One study defined them 
as chronic conditions that lasted or expected to last 3 
or more months. Four of 14 articles did not specify the 
list of NCDs studied; for the remaining 10 papers, five 
papers included a full list of self-reported NCDs that 
were studied, while five papers stated the most prevalent 
self-reported NCDs. The most common NCDs studied 
were diabetes, hypertension, stroke, arthritis and respi-
ratory disease.
Quality of included articles
Online supplementary appendix p 7 shows the scoring 
for quality assessment, where studies were categorised 
into high (4–6 points), moderate (3 points) or satisfac-
tory (0–2 points) quality. Median and mean quality scores 
for eligible studies were 3.5 and 3.4, respectively, with 
50% of articles categorised as high quality. All papers, 
except the three papers classified as satisfactory quality, 
were nationally representative. Eleven of 14 papers (80%) 
only measured NCDs with self-reporting. Six of 14 papers 
did not compare results with a reference group without

did not compare with patients with 0 NCD).
out-of-pocket expenditure on medicines
Table 3 summarises key results on OOPE on medicines by 
numbers of multimorbidities.
Absolute OOPE on medicines
Ten of 14 articles provided absolute amounts of annual 
OOPE on medicines. In all 10 studies, a greater number 
of NCDs were associated with a larger absolute annual 
OOPE on medicines, and hence, as a proportion of 
annual national average wages, and proportion of mean 
annual household net adjusted disposable income per 
capita.
Figure 2 shows the associations between numbers of 
multimorbidities, and OOPE on medicines as a propor-
tion of annual national average wages, and proportion of 
mean annual household net adjusted disposable income 
per capita. 
When number of NCDs increased from 0 to 1, 2 
and ≥3, annual OOPE on medicines increased by an 
average of 2.7 times, 5.2 times and 10.1 times, respec-
tively. When number of NCDs increased from 0 to 1, 
2, ≥2 and ≥3, individuals spent a median of 0.36% (IQR 
0.15%–0.51%), 1.15% (IQR 0.62%–1.64%), 1.41% (IQR 
0.86%–2.15%), 2.42% (IQR 2.05%–2.64%) and 2.63% 
(IQR 1.56%–4.13%) of mean annual household net 
adjusted disposable income per capita, respectively, on 
annual OOPE on medicines.

The magnitude of OOPE increment as number 
of NCDs increased varied among studies. In Crystal 
 
et al’s study,22 a high-quality paper from the USA on a 
nationally representative survey on Medicare beneficia-
ries aged 65 
years and above, annual OOPE on medicines 
was 2.5 times (US$254), 3.7 times (US$379), 5.6 times 
(US$581) and 7.7 times higher (US$791) for those with 1, 
2, 3–5 and >5 
NCDs, respectively, compared with those with 
no NCDs (US$103). Jung et al’s study,35 a moderate-quality 
paper from Korea on a nationally representative popula-
tion aged 20 and above, reported that absolute amounts 
of annual OOPE on medicines, compared with those with 
1 NCD (US$82), were 1.9 times (US$156) and 3.2 times 
higher (US$260) for those with 2 and ≥3 NCDs, respectively.
One study, by Kemp et al28 from Australia, ranked in 
the satisfactory-quality category, which conducted a 
nationally representative survey of households and indi-
viduals across Australian states and territories, examined 
multimorbidity by specific disease clusters, in addition to 
examining number of NCDs. With the same number of 
NCDs, certain combinations of NCDs had higher OOPE 
on medicines than others. The article compared patients 
with diabetes only (one NCD) with those with three NCDs 
(diabetes with depression and gastro-oesophageal reflux 
disease), and compared patients with acute coronary 
syndrome (ACS) (one NCD) with those with three NCDs 
(ACS with asthma and osteoarthritis). Those with ACS 
(either alone or in conjunction with others) experienced 
greater OOPE compared with patients with diabetes 
(either alone or in conjunction with others).
OOPE on medicines as proportion of total healthcare expenditure 
by patients
Four papers studied the share of OOPE on medicines 
in total healthcare expenditure by individuals and 
households. In general, patients with more multimor-
bidities experienced higher OOPE on medicines, as a 
proportion of total OOPE on healthcare and medical 
services by patients. Paez et al27 studied elderly subjects 
aged more than 65 years in the USA and reported that 
annual OOPE on medicines as a proportion of total 
healthcare expenditures by patients increased from 
31.5% (zero NCD) to 50.5%, and to 63.5%, for one and 
two NCDs, respectively.

Increased financial burden of lower income groups
Ruger and Kim’s study,26 a paper ranked as high quality, 
using the Korean National Health and Nutrition 
survey, found that patients from lower income quintiles 
suffered greater OOPE burden ratios (ratio of average 
OOPE to individual’s share of household income). The 
authors reported that OOPE burden ratios for subjects 
of the lowest income quintile were 6.0, 22.6, 27.4 and 
37.7 for patients with zero, one, two, and three or more 
NCDs, respectively. OOPE burden ratios for subjects 
from the highest income quintile experienced lower 
burdens of 1.4, 3.3 and 4.9 for zero, one and two NCDs, 
respectively, and even dropped to 3.9 for those with ≥3 
NCDs.
secondary outcomes
Online supplementary appendix pp 8–11 summarises 
secondary outcomes. Five papers studied the association 
of multimorbidity with medicine utilisation. Consump-
tion of medicines increased with multimorbidity. In 
Hennessy et al’s study,34 as the proportion of house-
hold income spent on OOPE on medicines increased 
from 0 to 0%–5% to >5%, mean number of medica-
tions used increased from 4.0 to 3.9 to 6.9, respectively. 
Two papers, both ranked as satisfactory quality, studied 
coping strategies for OOPE on medicines. Non-adher-
ence to medicines was the coping strategy for high 
OOPE incurred by patients. Campbell et al29 found 
37.7% of respondents who reported financial barriers 
to medications stopped taking their prescribed medi-
cations. Hennessy et al34 found that 5.2% of individuals 
spending less than 5% of their income on OOPE on 
medicines, and 21.5% of individuals spending more than 
5% of their income on OOPE on medicines, reported 
 
non-adherence.

which primary and secondary outcomes were reported 
by each of the 14 papers.
dIsCussIon
summary and interpretation of findings
A greater number of multimorbidities were associated 
with higher OOPE on medicines. This finding could be 
explained by polypharmacy worsening with more NCDs, 
which gives rise to higher OOPE on medicines. The 
problem of polypharmacy may be a result of single-dis-
ease guidelines applied to multimorbid patients, even 
though such guidelines were designed based on frame-
works that excluded patients with multimorbidities.4 6 
Some evidence from our results suggested that with the 
same number of NCDs, specific combination of NCDs 
yielded higher OOPE on medicines. This is likely due 
to certain NCDs requiring more medicines or more 
expensive medicines than others. A greater number 
of multimorbidities were also associated with higher 
OOPE on medicines as a proportion of total healthcare 
expenditures by patients, which may have implications 
that multimorbid patients with higher OOPE on medi-
cines had to allocate less resources to other medical 
services.
We also found that absolute OOPE on medicines for 
the elderly was higher than the young, at every multi-
morbidity level, indicating that being older is associated 
with being more vulnerable to higher OOPE on medi-
cines, consistent with other studies showing that the 
elderly tend to suffer from higher medicine utilisation 
and healthcare expenditures.36 Some evidence from our 
study also suggested that OOPE on medicines accounted 
for a substantially greater proportion of income for 
low-income groups. Our results are consistent with find-
ings from other systematic reviews on high susceptibility 
of household impoverishment from poor management 
of NCDs in low-income group.5
Non-adherence to medicines was found as a common 
coping strategy for OOPE on medicines and polyphar-
macy, a finding consistent with other papers, which will 
have adverse consequences on patient outcomes.37
strengths and limitations
Our paper is the first systematic review examining 
OOPE on medicines for multiple chronic condi-
tions. We conducted an extensive search via medical 
and economic databases, including grey literature, 
through the use of precise search terms and applica-
tion of stringent inclusion criteria.
A limitation was OOPE on medicines not being 
studied specifically with multimorbidity (eg, in associ-
ation with Charlson Comorbidity Index, an indication 
of NCD severity, but not number of NCDs). Hence, 
there is a need to address these gaps in future studies 
by examining OOPE specifically, and how OOPE 
is associated with different numbers and types of 
NCDs. Another limitation was that most eligible arti-
cles examined numbers of NCDs without reporting 
the exact chronic conditions. Future studies should 
examine specific NCDs with a view to understanding 
which NCDs may yield higher OOPE on medicines.28 
The number of NCDs and OOPE were mostly self-re-
ported and may be subject to greater under-reporting 
of NCDs in persons from lower socioeconomic 
background.
Regarding quality assessment of included articles, the 
NOS is an established and well-used quality assessment 
tool for non-randomised studies. The NOS has poten-
tial limitations as questions over the validity of the scale 
have been raised,38 and we adjusted the NOS to meet 
our analysis, specifically altering the grading categories 
to match NCD measurement rather than a specific expo-
sure, and remove questions relating to follow-up. None-
theless, with a descriptive analysis, the NOS is very useful 
in providing comparison between studies reported, and 
our adjustments to the NOS are in line with assessing

the key biases potentially present (including selection, 
measurement and representativeness).
Policy implications
Individuals suffering from multimorbidities may have 
greater OOPE on medicines due to their complex treat-
ment needs. Despite increasing prevalence of multi-
morbidity, current health policies and clinical practices 
rely on a single-disease specific approach. This may 
suggest to policymakers to move from a single-disease 
framework to one that takes into account multimor-
bidity, when allocating funds and when designing poli-
cies aimed at financial protection. Low socioeconomic 
status groups whose high rate of NCDs and low incomes 
result in more price-sensitive behaviour, as well as being 
more sensitive to the ill effects of high cost sharing, 
may need priority attention.5 In addition to NCD multi-
morbidity, vulnerable groups may experience a double 
burden from NCDs and infectious diseases, which may 
drive patients into further impoverishment.39 Targeted 
government funding and support programmes should 
take into account multimorbidity status of individuals, 
particularly for the elderly and low-income groups who 
are most vulnerable to OOP hardships.
In considering a policy response to the financial 
burden and impoverishment from OOPE on medicines 
for multimorbidity, there may be a need for policy 
interventions to account for the underestimation of 
the problem in standard measures, owing to the impact 
of coping strategies (eg, non-adherence). For example, 
vulnerable and marginalised groups may not even seek 
healthcare and hence will not be prescribed medicines, 
resulting in the under-representation of the true extent 
of multimorbidity and potential implications for OOPE 
on medicines.40 Policy measures could include exemp-
tions from certain costs for the elderly and low socio-
economic status groups, lower caps on copayments and 
subsidies for vital drugs. Prescription drug cost sharing 
benefit plans must be designed to provide enhanced 
and broadened coverage for multimorbidities, particu-
larly for certain NCD combinations.
There are also important clinical implications of 
OOPE in patients with multimorbidity. The literature 
shows a trend that multimorbidity in family practice is 
now the norm rather than the exception.41 Clinicians 
need to consider the financial burden incurred by 
patients with multimorbidity due to polypharmacy, and 
the risks of non-adherence and foregoing medicines 
as coping strategies. Another crucial clinical implica-
tion relates to the need for better clinical prescription 
guidelines to minimise prescription of unnecessary 
medicines for chronic illness which may cause unwar-
ranted expenditures on medicines by patients.6 42
ConClusIon
Multimorbidity of NCDs is increasingly costly to health-
care systems and OOPE on medicines can severely 
compromise financial protection and UHC. The evidence 
reviewed here shows the relationship between multimor-
bidity and OOPE on medicines. It is crucial to recog-
nise the need for better equity and financial protection, 
and policymakers must examine health system financial 
options, cost sharing policies and service patterns for 
those with NCD multimorbidities.
