AIMS
To investigate whether acid-suppression medicines (ASMs) increase the risk of bacterial gastroenteritis.
METHODS
A population-based, propensity-score matched cohort study using a record-linkage database in Tayside, UK. The study consisted
of 188 323 exposed to ASMs (proton-pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists) and 376 646 controls (a propensity-
score matched cohort from the rest of population who were not exposed to ASMs) between 1999 and 2013. The main outcome
measure was a positive stool test for Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella or Escherichia coli O157. The associ-
ation between ASMs and risk of bacterial gastroenteritis was assessed by a Cox regression model.
RESULTS
There were 22 705 positive test results (15 273 C. difficile [toxin positive], 6590 Campylobacter, 852 Salmonella, 129 Shigella and
193 E. coli O157, not mutually exclusive) with a total of 5 729 743 person-years follow up time in Tayside, 1999–2013. The ad-
justed hazard ratios for culture positive diarrhoea for the proton-pump inhibitors and histamine-2 receptor antagonists exposed
vs. unexposed cohort were 2.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33, 3.17) during follow–up time for samples submitted from the
community and 1.28 (95% CI 1.08, 1.52) for samples submitted from hospitals. Compared with the unexposed cohort, patients
in the exposed group had increased risks of C. difficile and Campylobacter [adjusted hazard ratios of 1.70 (95% CI 1.28, 2.25), 3.71
(95% CI 3.04, 4.53) for community samples, and 1.42 (95% CI 1.17, 1.71), 4.53 (95% CI 1.75, 11.8) for hospital samples,
respectively].
CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that community prescribed ASMs were associated with increased rates of C. difficile and Campylobacter positive
gastroenteritis in both the community and hospital settings.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Acid-suppression medications are increasingly being prescribed in both the community and hospital settings in the UK.
• Omeprazole was the most commonly prescribed acid-suppression medication by volume in Scotland in the past 2 years.
• Acid-suppressing drugs have been implicated as a risk factor for bacterial gastroenteritis but meta-analyses have provided
inconsistent findings.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS
• In a population-based study with good ascertainment of exposure and outcome, acid-suppression medications were
associated with increased rates of culture-positive stool tests for presumed diarrhoea submitted from both the community
and hospitals.
• The risk of positively testing stool samples for C. difficile and Campylobacter was increased with exposure to
acid-suppressing medications.
• Whilst acid-suppression therapy is often considered relatively free from adverse effects, patients who are taking
acid-suppression medications need to be aware of the increased risks of bacterial gastroenteritis.
Introduction
Bacterial gastroenteritis continues to be a major global chal-
lenge with increased morbidity, mortality, and significant
public health and social implications. Clostridium difficile is
more common in the hospital setting than in the community
[1] although community-acquired C. difficile infection is
increasing [2]. C difficile is one of the most prevalent organ-
isms causing healthcare associated infections in Scotland,
with 3634 cases in patients aged 65 years and over in 2009
with an annual overall rate for 2009 of 0.71 per 1000 total
occupied bed days [3]. Campylobacter
, Salmonella, Shigella
and Escherichia coli O157 account for the majority of cases
of bacterial pathogens identified in the community setting
in Scotland, with more than 7500 reports in 2009 and the
overall rate of reported Campylobacter infection in 2009 was
123.4 per 100 000 [4]. Widely documented risk factors for
Campylobacter
, Salmonella, Shigella and E. coli O157 include
consumption of undercooked meat, contact with animals
and foreign travel. For C. difficile, common predisposing
factors include old age, antibiotic use, hospitalization, under-
lying comorbid illnesses and gastrointestinal procedures.
There
are
two
classes
of
acid-suppression
medication:
proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs), which stop acid secretion by
inhibiting proton pumps located in the canalicular mem-
brane of the parietal cell; and histamine-2 receptor antago-
nists (H2RAs), which target histamine, one of the primary
regulators of acid secretion. More recently, acid-suppression
medications have been implicated as a risk factor for bacterial
gastroenteritis [5–18]. However, other studies have found no
association between these bacterial infections and use of PPIs
[19–23]. Acid suppression medications, such as PPIs, are
increasingly being prescribed in both the community and
hospital settings. The aim of this study was to investigate
whether acid-suppression medicines increase the risk of
bacterial gastroenteritis.
Methods
Study design
This was a cohort study in which patients exposed to acid-
suppression drugs were compared to a matched cohort of
patients not exposed to these drugs during the study period
of January 1999 to February 2013. The cohorts were drawn
from the Tayside Medicines Monitoring Unit (MEMO) data-
base, which covers a geographically compact population
and serves about 400 000 patients, mixed urban and rural,
in the National Health Service in Scotland, 97% of whom
are Caucasian [24]. The National Health Service is tax-funded,
free at the point of consumption, and covers the entire popu-
lation. In Tayside, there is almost no health care delivered
without the National Health Service and there is a low rate
of patient migration (<3% of patients aged ≥60 years left
the Tayside region over a 5-year period from 2004 to 2008).
This population-based, record-linkage database contains
several datasets including all dispensed community prescrip-
tions, hospital discharge data, demographic data, laboratory
results including blood, urine and stool tests, and other data,
all of which are linked by a community health index number
that is unique to each patient.
Study population
The study population consisted of residents of Tayside regis-
tered with a general practitioner (GP) between January 1999
and February 2013. It was a dynamic population that in-
cluded people who registered with a GP, died or left Tayside
during the study period. Patients with inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), defined as those hospitalized for or on medica-
tion for IBD, bowel cancer or gastrointestinal surgery, were
excluded. Patients with <30 days’ follow-up were also
excluded from the study.
Exposed cohort
The exposed cohort consisted of patients who received at least
one dispensed prescription of acid-suppression drugs,either
PPIs or H2RAs, during the study period. An index date was
defined for each patient as the date of first exposure, or 1st
January 1999 if the exposure period spanned this date.
Control cohort
A pool of potential control patients was created by assigning
index dates at random to unexposed patients by incidence
density sampling from the distribution of index dates in the
exposed cohort. Exposed patients could also be included as
potential controls, with their follow-up time censored at the

 first prescription for an acid-suppressing drug. A control
cohort was created by matching unexposed patients to each
exposed patient within deciles of a propensity score distribu-
tion, and selecting two patients randomly. The propensity
scores were the probabilities of exposure to acid-suppressing
drugs estimated from a logistic regression model with the
covariates evaluated on each patient’s index date. The details
of covariates are listed in the next section.
Outcomes and covariates
The primary outcome was bacterial gastroenteritis defined as
the composite of a stool test that was positive for C. difficile,
Campylobacter, Salmonella, Shigella or E. coli O157 (culture-
positive tests). The secondary outcomes were individual com-
ponents of the composite of the primary outcome, culture
negative tests, and any completed stool test (a surrogate for
symptoms of diarrhoea). A stool sample originating from
primary care was classified as a community sample and one
originating from a hospital in-patient source was classified
as a hospital sample.
Covariates included sex and the following, evaluated on
each patient’s index date: socioeconomic status measured
by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation [25], history
of
cardiovascular
disease,
diabetes
mellitus,
pulmonary
disease, renal disease, liver disease, cancer (excluding bowel
cancer)
and
human
immunodeficiency
virus/acquired
immune deficiency syndrome. Time dependant covariates
were: age, calendar year, season (quarters), hospitalization
for any reason, hospitalization with peptic ulcer, hospitaliza-
tion with another infection, recent discharge (in the last
28 days) and community antibiotic use.
Definition of acid-suppression therapy exposure
Exposure periods for PPIs and H2RAs were calculated sepa-
rately. The proportions of acid-suppression exposure were
59% for PPI and 41% for H2RAs. The quantity of drug supplied
and the dosing instructions were used to estimate the length
of exposure provided by each prescription. If an exposure pe-
riod was followed by another prescription within 180 days it
was treated as an unbroken period of exposure (a conventional
and commonly used cut-off point in drug safety research),
otherwise treatment was deemed to have discontinued
(Figure 1). A mean daily dose was calculated over each expo-
sure period (the sum of the daily doses on each prescribed
day divided by the total length of the exposure period). PPI
doses were normalized to esomeprazole by multiplying by: 1
for pantoprazole and omeprazole; 4/3 for lansoprazole, and 2
for rabeprazole. H2RA doses were standardized to cimetidine
by multiplying by 8/3 for nizatidine and ranitidine and by
20 for famotidine [26, 27]. Tertiles of each normalized dose
distribution
(18
and
25
mg
day–1
for
PPI,
747
and
1190 mg day–1 for H2RA) were used to define categorical low,
medium and high dose variables for each drug class.
Statistical analysis
Proportional hazard models, stratified by GP practice, were
fitted to the time from each patient’s index date to an out-
come. The proportional hazard model assumption was
checked before the analysis. Time-dependent variables listed
in the covariates section were built into the models. The pri-
mary analysis compared the exposed subjects while they con-
tinued
acid-suppression
therapy
with
their
unexposed
controls over the same length of time from their respective
index dates. A further set of analyses included the exposed pa-
tients only, and were designed to assess dose responses. Popu-
lation attributable risks were calculated by study year for
hospital and community settings. All analyses were carried
out using SAS version 9.3.
Sensitivity analyses
Losec, a registered trademark name of omeprazole was made
available over-the-counter (OTC) in low dose for limited du-
ration in 2004 and H2 antagonists were also made available
OTC in low dose for limited duration in 1994. We had no

 record of such use. However, patients aged 60 years or older
were not charged for prescribed drugs and were unlikely to
purchase them OTC. To minimize any bias due to unrecorded
exposure to omeprazole we did two sensitivity analyses, one
with follow-up time censored at the beginning of 2004, and
another restricted to patients aged 60 years or more.
The primary analysis revealed a very large excess risk asso-
ciated with hospitalization, which may have masked other ef-
fects.
Therefore,
in
unplanned
sensitivity
analyses
we
censored each patient at their first admission to hospital fol-
lowing their index date. Further sensitivity analyses ex-
cluded: (i) prevalent users; (ii) patients with only one
prescription of acid-suppression drugs; and (iii) the first 15
or 30 days after index date.
We also examined heterogeneity in the effects of drug ex-
posure between practices, and conducted a meta-analysis to
obtain a pooled estimate allowing for between-practice
variations.

Results
Study population
We found 571 239 distinct patients registered with Tayside
practices between 1999 and 2013. We excluded 2280 patients
with <30 days follow-up in the study period, and 16 806 pa-
tients with IBD or bowel cancer. Among the remaining
552 153 eligible patients 149 636 stool tests were conducted
in a total of 5.7 million patient years follow up. There were
22 705 positive test results (15 273 C. difficile [toxin positive],
6590 Campylobacter, 852 Salmonella, 129 Shigella and 193 E.
coli O157, not mutually exclusive).
The exposed cohort consisted of 188 323 patients exposed
to acid-suppression drugs during the study period. We identi-
fied 376 646 control patients, two for each exposed patient
selected randomly from unexposed patients in the same prac-
tice and the same decile of the propensity score distribution.
The baseline covariates for each cohort are summarized in
Table 1.
Primary analysis
The hazard ratios (HRs) obtained from the primary analysis
(i.e. for culture-positive diarrhoea in patients exposed to
acid-suppressing drugs vs. an unexposed cohort) are shown in
Figure 2. The HR for the exposed vs. unexposed cohort was
2.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.33, 3.17) for samples
submitted from the community. However, there was a smaller
risk associated with exposure to community prescribed acid-
suppressing
drugs
for
samples
originating
in
hospitals
(HR = 1.28 [95% CI 1.08, 1.52]). Hospital in-patients had a
very high risk of culture-positive diarrhoea when compared
to out-patients (HR = 89.7 [95% CI 72.3, 111.2]). If the reason
for hospitalization was associated with infection the risks
were even greater (HR = 11.6 [95% CI 9.91, 13.4]) relative to
hospitalization for other reasons.
The risk was also elevated in patients with human immu-
nodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome
or pulmonary or renal disease at baseline. There was no clear
evidence of a trend with socioeconomic status. There was an
increase in the rate of detection of culture-positive diarrhoea
between 1999 and 2006, and some evidence of a small de-
cline since 2009. Risk was higher in the summer months
(April to September) than in the first quarter of the year.
There was little evidence of a trend with age, although pa-
tients aged 20–29 years had higher rates than other age
groups.
Secondary and sensitivity analyses
Estimates of the HR for exposed vs. unexposed patients in
subgroup and sensitivity analyses are summarized in Table 2.
The HR for samples from the community was slightly lower in
older patients, as would be expected if exposure to OTC
omeprazole
had
diluted
the
apparent
effect
of
acid-
suppression therapy. However, it was also lower before OTC
omeprazole became available in 2004. The lowest HR was
1.29 (95% CI 1.06, 1.57) for culture-positive samples from
hospitals for patients aged over 60 years old. The exclusion
of prevalent users, the first 15 days or 30 days after the index
date and patients with only one prescription had little effect
on the HRs for culture-positive samples (Table 2). The highest
HR was 4.53 (95% CI 1.75, 11.8) for samples from hospital for
Campylobacter
.
The HRs associated with acid-suppression with Campylo-
bacter cases were 3.71 (95% CI 3.04, 4.53) for community
samples, where this organism accounted for 63% of tested
positive cases, and 4.53 (95% CI 1.75, 11.8) in hospitals,
where it accounted for only 6% of tested positive cases. The
HRs for C. difficile cases were 1.70 (95% CI 1.28, 2.25) from
the community and 1.42 (95% CI 1.17, 1.71) from hospital.
C. difficile accounted for 92% of positive stool cases in hospi-
tals and 27% of tested positive cases in the community. There
were too few cases of Salmonella, Shigella and E. coli O157 to
allow analyses of these organisms individually. The HR for
tested negative cases was 3.30 (95% CI 3.10, 3.52) in the
community and 1.33 (95% CI 1.25, 1.42) in hospital.
Censoring follow-up time at first hospitalization gener-
ally yielded HRs similar to or slightly higher than those
obtained in the community without censoring.
Dose response relationship
Figure 3 shows the association between dose and primary and
secondary outcomes. There was a clear dose response rela-
tionship between acid-suppression medication and culture
negative outcomes. Compared with medium dose, the HRs
for low dose and high dose were 0.90 (95% CI 0.86, 0.95)
and 1.06 (95% CI 1.02, 1.11) for PPIs; and 0.95 (95% CI
0.84, 1.06) and 1.16 (95% CI 1.07, 1.27) for H2RA, respec-
tively. These findings may support a causal relationship be-
tween acid-suppressing medications and symptoms that
lead to stool culture. However, we did not observe a dose–
response relationship for stool tested positive diarrhoea due
to C. difficile and Campylobacter
.

 Practice heterogeneity
The hazard ratios for the effect of acid-suppression on
stool test-positive diarrhoea rates in the community esti-
mated for each practice separately. Time-to-event analyses
with time dependent covariates in very large datasets are
not always feasible because of the computing resources re-
quired. Although we were able to conduct overall analyses
in this study, we also used the methodology of meta-
analyses to pool the HRs from individual practices for
comparison. The test for heterogeneity was statistically
significant (P = 0.004), but there were no extreme outliers
and the scale of the over-dispersion was not large. The
pooled HR was 2.85 (95% CI 2.39, 3.40), assuming a ran-
dom effects model. This is close to the value obtained

 from the primary analysis and with a similar confidence
interval [2.72 (95% CI 2.33, 3.17)].
Attributable risk
The use of acid-suppressing drugs approximately doubled
over the study period (Table 3). In 1999, 5.3% of patient
follow-up time in the community and 18.6% of follow-up
time for hospitalized patients were in the exposed cohort.
In 2012, the exposure rates were 11.6% in the community
and 35.5% in hospitals. Our estimates of exposure rates in
hospital were based on the assumption that patients contin-
ued exposure to community prescribed drugs in hospital
and do not include prescriptions issued in hospital.
We have estimated attributable events in the community
and in hospitals in each year of the study. In 2012, for exam-
ple, 578 events occurred during exposure in the community
and we estimate that 578 × (2.72–1)/2.72 = 366 of these
(27.1% of all cases in that year) were attributable to exposure.
Had there been no exposure to acid-suppressing drugs the ex-
pected event rate would have been 2.46 per 1000 patient
years (ptpy) instead of 3.38 ptpy. The contribution of expo-
sure to the observed population event rate was therefore
0.92 ptpy.
Discussion
We have found that acid-suppression medicines were associ-
ated with increased risks of bacterial gastroenteritis. Patients
in the community had higher risk of diarrhoea associated
with acid-suppression medicines use than patients in hospi-
tals. The sensitivity analysis showed that the results were
unlikely to be confounded by other factors.
The supposed higher risk of C. difficile infection in PPI
users is based on the increased ability of the acid-resistant
spore to convert to the vegetative form and survive in a
hypo-acid environment [28]. Gastric acid may not effectively
kill C. difficile but could alter the growth of other commensal
bowel flora. Increasing acid-suppression has previously been
associated with increased risk of C. difficile infections with
PPI exposure [17, 29] but a meta-analysis found that the qual-
ity of evidence was poor. In a separate meta-analysis, the same
authors found that H2RA exposure was associated with
C. difficile infection (pooled effect estimate: 1.44, 95% CI
[1.22–1.70]), this effect being strongest in hospitalized
patients [30]. This is supported by our data and other meta-
analyses [16]. Other authors have concluded that PPI expo-
sure is associated with a higher risk of C. difficile than H2
antagonist exposure.
Bavishi and Dupont [31] reviewed the evidence for the
association between PPIs and bacterial gastrointestinal infec-
tion and concluded that there was evidence to support the as-
sociation. However, in general, previous studies lacked access
to all laboratory tests on a population basis. It was also sug-
gested that the role of the gut microbiome in arresting patho-
gen colonization and growth is important for protection
against C. difficile infection [32, 33]. Seto and colleagues [33]
hypothesized that PPI use affected the distal gut microbiome
over time and they did a study in nine healthy human sub-
jects and five treatment-naïve subjects with C. difficile
infection. They found that PPIs resulted in decreases in ob-
served operational taxonomic unit counts, and decreases in
observed species counts which were reversible after cessation
of PPI usage within 1 month. This finding may be a potential
explanation for the association between prolonged PPI usage
and C. difficile infection incidence [33]. PPI use was also
linked with an increased risk of serious infections including
gastroenteritis in veterans with decompensated cirrhosis
[34]. However, among hospitalized adults with C. difficile,
receipt of PPIs concurrent with C. difficile treatment was not
associated with C. difficile infection recurrence [35].
A recent study [36] of the association between PPIs and
Campylobacter and Salmonella infections was conducted in
the general population of Wales including over one million
patients. The study applied a new analysis technique: prior
event rate ratio (PERR) adjustment to control both measured
and unmeasured confounders (i.e. the unadjusted event rate
ratio during the study was adjusted by dividing by the PERR)
[37]. They found that the rate of Campylobacter and Salmo-
nella infections was already at 3.1–6.9 times that of non-PPI
patients even before PPI prescription. The adjusted HR was
6.91 (95% CI 5.16, 9.26) for the PPI group when compared
with the non-PPI group. However, the ratio of events in the
PPI group compared with the non-PPI group using the prior
event rate ratio was 1.17 (95% CI 0.74, 1.61) for Campylobac-
ter and 1.00 (95% CI 0.5, 1.5) for Salmonella. The HRs of Cam-
pylobacter in our study were 3.71, (95% CI 3.04, 4.53) in the
community and 4.53, (95% CI 1.75, 11.8) in hospital and
they were significantly higher than the PERR adjusted HR of
1.7. Comparison of our study with the Welsh study should
be done with caution as there are several key differences be-
tween the studies. Firstly we used a Cox regression model
with a time-dependent variable technique to address risk
changes including PPI exposure over time. This is an
established method in drug safety research. However, the
Welsh study applied a relatively new method to get an ad-
justed HR. Secondly, our study was a propensity matched co-
hort study with a mean follow-up of 10 years while the Welsh
study only used 2 years of data for their cohort study (i.e. the
12-month period before PPI prescription and the 12-month
period post-PPI prescription) and the control group was only
matched for date with the PPI patients (matched on day,
month, year). Thirdly, the Welsh study used prescribed pre-
scriptions for exposure, while our study used dispensed pre-
scriptions which would eliminate primary noncompliance
as a previous study showed that some patients do not collect
their prescriptions at a pharmacy [38]. The association be-
tween Campylobacter and PPI use has also been supported by
a recent ecological study from The Netherlands and a study
from the UK [39, 40]. The high risk for tested negative cases
in the community (HR, 3.3) and in hospital (1.33) suggests
that acid-suppressing therapy itself may lead to symptoms
that result in a stool sample being submitted. In fact, these
cases of culture-negative diarrhoea are probably due to an or-
ganism that has not been detected, as culture-positive speci-
mens represent only a fraction of infections that actually
occur in the community or hospital populations.
Although not the primary reason for carrying out the
study, we also found that very high hazards of culture-
positive stool samples were associated with recent hospitali-
zation (HR = 89.7 [95% CI 72.3, 111.2]) or hospitalization

 with an infection (HR = 11.6 [95% CI 9.9, 13.7]) or with com-
munity antibiotic use (HR = 2.3 [95% CI 2.0, 2.6]). Thus, the
effects of hospitalization and antibiotic use appear to be the
dominant associations with culture-positive stool samples.
Finally, acid-suppressing therapy showed a dose-dependent
association with an increased risk of culture negative sample
submission, supporting the hypothesis that these drugs
themselves induce diarrhoea that leads to stool sample
submission.
Our study has some strengths and limitations. We used a
well validated population-based record linkage database with
complete ascertainment of all stool samples submitted to the
regional laboratory. It was possible to determine the source of
the stool samples, whether originating from the community
or hospitals. The database contained exposure data on dis-
pensed medications (rather than prescribed medications)
thus eliminating misclassification caused by primary non-
compliance and we could decode the intended dose and dura-
tion of medications. The study population had an excellent
roster file that allowed complete ascertainment of subject
eligibility over time and record-linkage was deterministic
(not probabilistic) resulting in more accurate linkage. We
were able to track subjects’ membership of individual primary
care practices, to measure a social deprivation score and to
obtain good data on comorbidities.
A limitation of the MEMO database is that exposure to
nonprescription drugs is not recorded, and omeprazole and
H2RAs have been available OTC since 2004 albeit in lower
doses. There are no culture data for viral causes of diarrhoea,
and only a restricted range of bacterial pathogens was investi-
gated in the study. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use
was not adjusted for in the analysis, but these drugs increase
intestinal permeability and may predispose to inflammation
or even susceptibility to infection. Parasitic infections were
also not included in the study outcome. Also, since MEMO
does not have information on disease severity, smoking, body
mass index, alcohol and other factors, which might be linked
to diarrhoea, we were unable to use them as matching
criteria. Although we used a propensity score to build an
unexposed cohort using available risk factors, and we
adjusted for multiple covariates and carried out sensitivity
analyses, we cannot exclude effects due to unrecognized or
unrecorded confounding factors. The effect of discontinuing
drugs is difficult to assess because the date of discontinuation
is estimated from the last known prescription and is subject
to error. Short-term effects, in particular, are likely to be
underestimated. Our estimates of attributable risk take no
account of any effects of discontinuation, and may therefore
be underestimates.
In conclusion, acid-suppressing therapy with PPIs or
H2RAs increased the risk of both bacterial gastrointestinal
infections and culture negative stool samples submitted
for presumed diarrhoea. Compared with subjects not tak-
ing PPIs or H2RAs, community-prescribed PPIs and H2RAs
were associated with increased rates of positive stool sam-
ples for C. difficile and Campylobacter submitted from both
the
community
and
hospitals.
Whilst
acid-suppression
therapy is often considered relatively free from adverse ef-
fects this present study suggests that there are significant
adverse gastrointestinal noninfective and infective conse-
quences of their use.
