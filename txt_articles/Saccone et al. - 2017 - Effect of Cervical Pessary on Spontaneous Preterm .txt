IMPORTANCE Spontaneous preterm birth is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality.
It is unclear if a cervical pessary can reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm delivery.
OBJECTIVE To test whether in asymptomatic women with singleton pregnancies and no
prior spontaneous preterm birth but with short cervical length on transvaginal ultrasound,
use of a cervical pessary would reduce the rate of spontaneous preterm birth at less than
34 weeks of gestation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Parallel-group, nonblinded, randomized clinical trial
conducted from March 1, 2016, to May 25, 2017, at a single center in Italy. Asymptomatic
women with singleton gestations, no previous spontaneous preterm births, and cervical
lengths of 25 mm or less at 18 weeks 0 days to 23 weeks 6 days of gestation were eligible.
INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either cervical pessary (n = 150)
or no pessary (n = 150). The pessary was removed between 37 weeks 0 days and 37 weeks
6 days of gestation or earlier if clinically indicated. The control group received standard care.
For cervical length of 20 mm or shorter, women in both groups were prescribed vaginal
progesterone, 200 mg/d, until 36 weeks 6 days of gestation. No bed rest or activity
restriction was recommended.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary end point was spontaneous preterm birth
at less than 34 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes were adverse events.
RESULTS Among 300 women who were randomized (mean age, 29 [SD, 6.3] years; mean
gestational age, 22 [SD, 1.3] weeks), 100% completed the trial. The primary end point
occurred in significantly fewer women in the pessary group. During follow-up, the pessary
group had a higher rate of increased or new vaginal discharge.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among women without prior spontaneous preterm birth who
had asymptomatic singleton pregnancies and short transvaginal cervical length, use of a
cervical pessary, compared with no pessary use, resulted in a lower rate of spontaneous
preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation. The results of this single-center, nonblinded
study among selected pregnant women require confirmation in multicenter clinical trials.

 P
reterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of ges-
tation, is a major cause of perinatal morbidity and
mortality.1 About 15 million infants were born prema-
turely in 2015, causing 1.1 million deaths as well as short- and
long-term disability in the survivors.2,3
Different strategies have been adopted for prevention of
spontaneous preterm birth. The evidence supports use
of vaginal progesterone in women with singleton pregnancy
with a short cervix,4,5 while cervical cerclage seems to be ben-
eficial only in the subgroup of singleton pregnancies with both
prior spontaneous preterm birth and cervical length of 25 mm
or less6 and not in women without prior spontaneous pre-
term birth,7 nor in women with multiple gestations.8 Interna-
tional guidelines recommend cervical cerclage for such high-
risk women.4
The cervical pessary is a silicone device that has been used
to prevent spontaneous preterm birth.9-14 The leading hypoth-
eses for its mechanism of action are that the pessary helps keep
the cervix closed and changes the inclination of the cervical
canal so that the pregnancy weight is not directly above the
internal os. The 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) in women
with singleton pregnancy with a short cervix published so far
provided contradictory results,9-12 and a meta-analysis by
Saccone et al13 concluded that in this subset of women, the cer-
vical pessary does not reduce the rate of spontaneous pre-
term delivery or improve perinatal outcome. However, clini-
cal heterogeneity within the trials was high, and the studies
included women both with and without prior preterm birth.13
The hypothesis of this trial was that in asymptomatic
women with singleton pregnancy without prior spontaneous
preterm birth but with short cervical length on transvaginal
ultrasound, the insertion of a cervical pessary would reduce
the rate of spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks
of gestation.
Methods
Study Design and Participants
This was a single-center, parallel-group RCT of women with
asymptomatic singleton pregnancies without prior spontane-
ous preterm birth but with short cervical length on transvagi-
nal ultrasound who were randomized to receive a cervical pes-
sary (ie, intervention group) or no pessary (ie, control group)
at the University of Naples Federico II (Naples, Italy) from
March 1, 2016, to May 25, 2017.
The trial was approved by the local ethics committee.
All participants in the trial provided written informed con-
sent. The trial protocol is available in Supplement 1.
Eligible women were those referred to the institution for
a diagnosis of short cervix during the routine anatomy scan.
In Italy, the anatomy scan is a routine ultrasound examina-
tion primarily used to assess fetal anatomy and detect the pres-
enceofanyfetalanomaliesconductedbetween18weeks0days
and 23 weeks 6 days of gestation. At the university, measure-
ment of the cervix using transvaginal ultrasound was re-
peated and women found to have a cervical length of 25 mm
or less were approached by the research staff and consented.
Inclusion criteria were age 18 to 50 years, singleton preg-
nancy, cervical length of 25 mm or less, and gestational age at
randomization between 18 weeks 0 days and 23 weeks 6 days
of gestation.
Exclusion criteria were multiple pregnancies, rupture of
membranes at the time of randomization, lethal fetal struc-
tural abnormality, cerclage in situ, vaginal bleeding at the time
ofrandomization,suspicionofchorioamnionitis,placentapre-
viaoraccreta,ballooningofmembranesoutsidethecervixinto
the vagina, cervical length of 0 mm, painful and regular uter-
ine contractions, or history of spontaneous preterm birth be-
tween 16 weeks 0 days and 36 weeks 6 days of gestation.
At the time of randomization, ethnicity of the women was
assessed by clinician determination given the different base-
line risk of preterm birth according to ethnicity.
Randomization and Masking
Eligible participants were randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to
either the cervical pessary or the control group. Women were
randomized by a web-based system using random blocks of
2, 4, and 6 to receive the Arabin pessary (Dr. Arabin GmbH &
Co) or no pessary. Randomization was stratified by cervical
length (<20 mm or ≥20 mm–≤25 mm). The randomization se-
quencewaspreparedbyanindependentstatisticianandimple-
mented by use of a central telephone number. The recruiters
and the trial coordinator did not have access to the random-
ization sequence. The allocation code was disclosed only af-
ter patient initials were confirmed. Clinicians did not have ad-
vance access to the randomization sequence.
Outcome assessors, data collectors, and data analysts were
blinded to allocated treatment group. Assessment of the out-
comes and outcome collection were made by clinicians not in-
volved in the clinical trial and reported in a form with only the
trial identification as the identifier. The data analyst was
blinded until the entire analysis was completed.
Interventions
Cervical length was measured by operators with certification
of competence in the technique (Fetal Medicine Foundation
Certificate of Competence in Cervical Assessment), as de-
scribed previously.15,16 The length of the cervix was mea-
sured with a transvaginal real-time ultrasound probe placed
Key Points
Question Does use of a cervical pessary reduce the rate of
spontaneous delivery before 34 weeks of gestation among women
with singleton pregnancies, short cervical length, and no prior
spontaneous preterm birth?
Findings In this randomized trial of 300 women, the rates of
spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks were 7.3% with
a cervical pessary compared with 15.3% without cervical pessary
use, a significant difference.
Meaning The use of a cervical pessary among women with
singleton pregnancies, short cervical length, and no prior
spontaneous preterm birth reduced the risk of spontaneous
preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation.

 in the anterior fornix of the vagina. Endocervical canal length
was measured as the distance between the internal and exter-
nalosbyusingastraightlinewithcalipersplacedatthenotches
made by the internal os and external os. Three anatomic land-
marks defined the appropriate sagittal view: the internal os,
the external os, and the endocervical canal. The image was
enlarged while visualizing the 3 landmarks simultaneously.
This procedure was repeated 3 times. Only the shortest cervi-
cal length measurement was recorded. Each examination was
performed during a minimum of 5 minutes.
At the time of randomization, all women in both groups
underwent a speculum examination, and vaginal swabs were
taken for bacteriological analysis. If the results showed infec-
tion, appropriate treatment was given without delaying the in-
sertion of the pessary in the intervention group. The pessary
was not removed if there was evidence of bacterial infection
after device insertion.
All the cervical pessaries used in the trial were certified by
European Conformity and were inserted by the attending phy-
sicians, who had received practical training in the placement
of the device. Pessary insertion training consisted of a didac-
tic session and a hands-on session. All staff were required to
demonstratecompetenceinpessaryplacementonalivemodel.
All cervical pessaries were purchased from the manufac-
turer.
In the intervention group, the cervical pessary was placed
at the time of randomization and was removed during the 37th
week (37 weeks 0 days–37 weeks 6 days) or earlier if clinically
indicated. Reason for earlier removal included active vaginal
bleeding, preterm labor with persistent contractions and ad-
vanced dilatation despite tocolysis, severe discomfort, or par-
ticipant request.
Women in the control group received the same obstetri-
cal care as those in the intervention group.
Forcervicallengthof20mmorless,womeninbothgroups
were prescribed vaginal progesterone 200-mg suppositories
daily until 36 weeks 6 days of gestation. No recommendation
was made about bed rest, activity, or vaginal intercourse.
All participants were followed up in outpatient settings ev-
ery month until delivery. In the pessary group, a digital ex-
aminationwasdoneateachmonthlyvisittoensureproperpes-
sary placement. At each follow-up visit, women were asked
whether they experienced any adverse events and about ad-
herence to progesterone therapy. Specifically, women were
asked about vaginal discharge, pelvic discomfort, and pelvic
pain. Bleeding or lacerations during the insertion and the re-
moval of the pessary were also recorded.
For women in both groups who presented after 26 weeks
of gestation with symptoms of preterm labor, tocolytics and
glucocorticoids were administrated for fetal lung maturation
and hospitalization was offered.
Outcomes
The primary outcome was spontaneous preterm birth at less
than 34 weeks of gestation.
Spontaneous preterm birth included either spontaneous
onset of preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of mem-
branes. Iatrogenic (medically indicated) preterm deliveries
were not included in the primary end point as they are due to
fetal or maternal conditions such as fetal distress or maternal
preeclampsia and cannot be modified by use of a pessary.
The prespecified secondary outcomes were spontaneous
preterm birth at less than 37, 32, and 28 weeks of gestation,
gestational age at delivery, latency (time from randomization
to delivery), preterm premature rupture of membranes at less
than 34 weeks of gestation, mode of delivery, maternal
adverse events (vaginal discharge and pelvic discomfort),
chorioamnionitis (inflammation of the chorion and amnion
by histopathological assessment after delivery), and neonatal
outcomes including birth weight, admission to a neonatal
intensive care unit, neonatal death (death of a live-born
infant within the first 28 days of life) and perinatal death
(either fetal death, defined as intrauterine fetal death after 20
weeks of gestation, or neonatal death), and a composite of
adverse perinatal outcomes, defined as at least 1 of the fol-
lowing: necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemor-
rhage grade 3 or 4, respiratory distress syndrome, broncho-
pulmonary dysplasia, retinopathy of prematurity requiring
therapy, blood culture–proven sepsis, and neonatal death.
Post hoc exploratory outcomes included preterm birth
(spontaneous and iatrogenic) at less than 37 weeks, 34 weeks,
32 weeks, and 28 weeks of gestation; iatrogenic preterm birth
at less than 34 weeks; birth weight less than 2500 g or less than
1500 g; and the components of the composite of adverse peri-
natal outcomes.
Data on pregnancy outcomes were obtained from hospi-
tal maternity records. In case of preterm birth, records were
examined to determine whether the delivery was medically
indicated (iatrogenic preterm birth) or spontaneous.

 Sample Size Calculation
Calculation of the sample size was based on the following con-
siderations: a prevalence of cervical length 25 mm or less of
about 1% to 2% in women with singleton gestation,15 an inci-
dence of preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation of
about 25% in women with singleton pregnancy using vaginal
progesterone for cervical length 20 mm or less, and a de-
crease in spontaneous preterm birth by 50% using a cervical
pessary.11 We determined that a sample size of 300 patients
(150 per group) would provide a power of 80% to detect a 50%
relative reduction in the primary outcome from a baseline risk
of 25%, with a 2-sided type I error of .05.
Statistical Analysis
Data are shown as means or as numbers and percentages. Uni-
variate comparisons of dichotomous data were performed
using the χ2 test with continuity correction. Comparisons be-
tween groups were performed with the use of the t test to test
group means by assuming equal within-group variances.
The primary analysis was an intention-to-treat compari-
son of the treatment assigned at randomization. The effect
of pessary use on the cumulative incidence of each outcome
was quantified in 2 ways: first as the difference between
treatment groups in cumulative incidence of the outcome
with 95% confidence intervals and second as the unadjusted
relative risk and its 95% confidence interval. Ninety-five
percent confidence intervals were assessed using the boot-
strap method. Original prespecified analysis included the use
of the odds ratio instead of the unadjusted relative risk
(Supplement 1). However, given that relative risks are easier
to interpret, we decided to quantified the incidence of the pri-
mary outcome by using the unadjusted relative risk.
The frequency of spontaneous preterm birth at less than
34 weeks of gestation in relation to gestational age was
assessed by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Two different panels
was assessed for this analysis: one with any type of delivery
(spontaneous and iatrogenic) as the event and one with only
spontaneous delivery as the event. Hazard ratios were esti-
mated using the Cox proportional hazards model.
No interim analyses were planned. No adjustment for mul-
tiple comparisons was made, so the findings of the secondary
outcomes should be considered exploratory. No patients were
lost to follow-up and no data were missing. A 2-sided P.05 was
consideredstatisticallysignificant.Statisticalanalysiswasper-
formed using SPSS version 19.0 (IBM Inc).
Post hoc subgroup analyses were performed to examine
the effect of a cervical pessary according to progesterone
therapy (yes vs no), and cervical length (≤10 mm vs >10 mm).
P values for the interaction between subgroup and treatment
were calculated using the Wald test.
Results
Trial Population
From March 2016 to May 2017, of the 503 women referred for
short cervical length, 300 asymptomatic women with single-
ton pregnancies without prior spontaneous preterm birth but
with a transvaginal ultrasound cervical length of 25 mm or less
between 18 weeks 0 days and 23 weeks 6 days of gestation
agreedtotakepartinthestudy,underwentrandomization,and
were enrolled and followed up.
Of the randomized women, 150 (50%) were randomized to
the cervical pessary group and 150 (50%) to the control group.
No women were excluded after randomization or lost to
follow-up (Figure 1). No women in the intervention group had
the pessary removed by request or for severe discomfort.
Table 1 shows the baseline demographic and clinical char-
acteristics for each group. There were 133 women (88.7%)
in the pessary group and 125 (83.3%) in the control group who
hadacervicallengthof20mmorlessandreceivedvaginalpro-
gesterone; 33 (22.0%) in the pessary group and 38 (25.3%)
in the control group received antibiotics because of positive
cultures from a vaginal swab at the time of randomization.
Use of antibiotic therapy among women with positive vaginal
cultures is shown in eTable 1 in Supplement 2.
The mean gestational age at randomization was 22.3 (SD,
1.4) weeks vs 22.4 (SD, 1.1) weeks and the mean cervical length
was 11.5 mm (SD, 5.7 mm) vs 12.5 mm (SD, 5.9 mm) in the pes-
sary and control groups, respectively.
Primary Outcome
Spontaneous preterm birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation
occurred in 11 women (7.3%) in the pessary group and 23
women (15.3%) in the control group (between-group differ-
ence,−8.0%;95%CI,−15.7%to−0.4%)(Table2).Inthesurvival

 analysis to 34 weeks of gestation, the incidence of spontane-
ous preterm birth was significantly lower in the pessary group
compared with the control group (hazard ratio, 0.36; 95% CI,
0.54-0.87) (Figure 2).
Prespecified Secondary Outcomes
The cervical pessary was associated with a significantly lower
rate of spontaneous preterm birth at less than 37 weeks of ges-
tation, longer gestational age at delivery and latency from ran-
domization to delivery, higher birth weight, lower rate of ad-
mission to a neonatal intensive care unit, and lower incidence
of adverse composite perinatal outcome compared with the
control group. There was no significant between-group dif-
ference in the incidence of spontaneous preterm birth at less
than 32 weeks or 28 weeks, but the trial was not powered for
these outcomes (Table 2).
Post Hoc Outcomes
The cervical pessary was associated with a significantly lower
rate of preterm birth at less than 37 weeks and 34 weeks of ges-
tation. The cervical pessary was also associated with signifi-
cantly lower rates of respiratory distress syndrome and reti-
nopathy of prematurity vs controls and with nonsignificantly
lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hem-
orrhage grade 3 or 4, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, and blood
culture–proven sepsis (eTable 2 in Supplement 2).
Adverse Events
During follow-up, the pessary group had a higher rate than the
control group of increased or new vaginal discharge (86.7% vs
46.0%; between-group difference, 40.7%; 95% CI, 30.1% to
50.3%),butnosignificantdifferencesinpelvicdiscomfortwere

 No cases of maternal death or serious injuries during in-
sertion or removal of the pessary were reported.
Post Hoc Subgroup Analyses
The tests of interaction for the post hoc subgroup analyses for
receipt of concomitant therapy with vaginal progesterone and
by cervical length of 10 mm or less vs greater than 10 mm were
not significant (P=.56 and P=.46 for interaction, respectively)
(eTable 3 in Supplement 2).
Discussion
This RCT showed that in asymptomatic women with single-
ton pregnancies without prior spontaneous preterm birth
but with a transvaginal ultrasound cervical length of 25 mm
or less, use of a cervical pessary resulted in a statistically sig-
nificantly lower rate of spontaneous preterm birth than no
pessary. Cervical pessary was also associated with a signifi-
cant difference in the secondary outcomes of longer gesta-
tional age at delivery, longer latency, and a lower incidence of
a composite of adverse neonatal outcomes but with a higher
rate of vaginal discharge.
This study did not support earlier findings of a meta-
analysis of 3 RCTs that showed no beneficial effect of a cervi-
cal pessary in reducing spontaneous preterm birth in women
with a singleton gestation and a cervical length of 25 mm or
less.13 None of the included studies9-11 were blinded for out-
comeassessors,datacollectors,ordataanalysts.Moreover,the
higher rate of preterm birth in the control group in 1 of the trials
(26.8%)11 is not concordant with those of the control groups
of the other 2 trials (5.5% and 11.3%).9,10 More than half of the
women included in the meta-analysis (932/1420) came from
1 large trial by Nicolaides et al,9 which drives the summary sta-
tistics. This trial was methodologically very different from our
study. Nicolaides et al included both women without prior pre-
term birth and those with prior preterm birth, and the study
included multiple sites, some of which did not enroll many

 participants, raising the possibility of lesser experience with
pessaryplacementandmanagement.9Thecurrentstudy’
strial
protocol included hands-on training and a requirement for all
staff to demonstrate pessary insertion competence on a live
model, while Nicolaides et al9 did not include this type of
training. The median cervical length at randomization was
lower in this study compared with the trial by Nicolaides et al
(approximately 12 mm vs 20 mm) and the rate of very short
cervix was higher (79% vs 29% for cervical length ≤15 mm).
The different results between the trials raises the question of
whether a cervical pessary can be effective only at very low
cervical length cutoffs, although there was no effect modifi-
cation by cervical length in the current study.
The results of the current study are consistent with those
of the trial by Goya et al,11 which concluded that a cervical pes-
sary could prevent preterm birth in a population of appropri-
ately selected at-risk women previously screened for cervical
length assessment on transvaginal ultrasound at the midtri-
mester visit. There were more women with prior preterm birth
inthetrialbyNicolaidesetal9(154/932[16.5%])comparedwith
the trial by Goya et al11 (41/380 [10.8%]). This raises the ques-
tion of whether a cervical pessary can be effective only in
women with a short cervix but without prior preterm birth.
Different strategies have been adopted for prevention of
pretermbirth,includingprogesteroneuse,5,17-19cerclage,6-8,20,21
cervical pessary use,9-14 and lifestyle modifications such as
smoking cessation,22 diet,23 aerobic exercise,24,25 and nutri-
tional supplements.26-30 Cervical cerclage is an invasive tech-
nique requiring anesthesia and an operating room.31 There-
fore, increasing interest has focused on use of a pessary for
preventionofpretermbirth.Acervicalpessaryisrelativelynon-
invasive,iseasytouse,doesnotrequireanesthesia,canbeused
in an outpatient clinic setting, and is easily removed when
necessary.32 The exact mechanism of the possible efficacy of
a cervical pessary to prevent spontaneous preterm birth in
women with short cervical length is not completely clear.
Vitsky33 first suggested in 1961 that the incompetent cervix is
aligned centrally, with no support except the nonresistant va-
gina. A cervical pessary would change the inclination of the
cervical canal, directing it more posteriorly. In doing so, the
weight of the pregnancy would be more on the anterior lower
segment.32 Another proposed mechanism is that the pessary
could strengthen the immunological barrier between the cho-
rioamnion-extraovular space and the vaginal microbiologi-
cal flora, as cerclage has been postulated to do.34
The strengths of the current study included blinding of the
outcome assessors, data collectors, and data analysts as well
as the 100% follow-up obtained because all women included
in the trial delivered at the study institution.
This study has several limitations. First, the open-label
nature of the trial could have affected medical decision mak-
ing, such as the timing of the removal of the pessary when a
participant presented with contractions. However, outcome
assessors and data analysts were blinded. Second, the explor-
atory nature of the secondary outcomes and the numerous
secondary end points with no adjustment for multiple com-
parisons could have led to type I error. Third, the single-
center nature of the trial raises the question of the external
generalizability of the findings. Fourth, all women in both
groups underwent vaginal swabs for bacteriological analysis.
The practice of screening and treating for vaginal infections
during pregnancy is a subject of debate and is not currently
recommended.
Conclusions
Among women without prior spontaneous preterm birth who
had asymptomatic singleton pregnancies and short transvagi-
nal cervical length, use of a cervical pessary, compared with
no pessary use, resulted in a lower rate of spontaneous pre-
term birth at less than 34 weeks of gestation. The results of this
single-center, nonblinded study among selected pregnant
women require confirmation in multicenter clinical trials.
