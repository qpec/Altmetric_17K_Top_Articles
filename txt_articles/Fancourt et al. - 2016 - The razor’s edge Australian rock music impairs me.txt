O
ver the past few decades, there has been interest in the role
of music in the operating theatre, both in serious medical
research and in the Christmas edition of the MJA.1-4 Music
is reportedly played 62e72% of the time in theatre, with classical
music being the most popular genre, followed by folk, rock, jazz
and blues.5 A number of studies have found beneficial effects of
music on surgical performance. For example, Jamaican music and
hip-hop (but not classical or jazz music) have been found to
increase the speed of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgical tasks,
and Jamaican music additionally can lead to more efficient
instrument manipulation, suggesting that Bob Marley could be of
assistance in surgical settings.6
However, there have also been accounts of dark and dangerous
effects of music in operating theatres, with 26% of anaesthetists
reporting that music reduced their vigilance,7 and observational
studies showing rising levels of frustration and repeat requests
between surgical staff in the presence of music.8 Further, a study
examining laporoscopic learning performance in novice surgeons
found that, on first exposure to performing the laparoscopy,
arousing music was associated with poorer task performance and
longer task time.9
To date, studies have focused on the impact of music on the surgical
skills of real surgeons, while there has been little research into
whether music can support surgical skills in the medically untrained
general public. Consequently, our study aimed to articulate whether
different genres of music can help or hinder speed, accuracy and
concentration when undertaking multiorgan resection in the surgi-
cal board game Operation. In selecting our music, we decided to
focus in particular on classical music by Mozart, well known for its
apparent beneficial effects on concentration and intellect (known as
the Mozart effect), and rock music from Australia (Oz rock) from the
authors’ favourite decade: the 1990s.
Methods
Participants
This was a single-blind, three-arm, randomised controlled trial.
Aspiring surgeons from the general public aged � 16 years were
recruited for the study at the Imperial Festival in May 2016, a public
engagement event held annually each spring at Imperial College
London that attracts about 15 000 visitors. Participants were
excluded if they had any formal surgical training or experience or if
they had hearing impairments. In total, 427 participants were
screened to take part and 352 completed participation: mean
age ¼ 35.0 years (SD, 14.2; range, 16e84 years). Of these, 184 were
men (mean age, 34.6 years; SD, 13.8) and 143 were women (mean
age, 35.5 years; SD, 14.4) (Box 1).
Procedure
Participants were asked for basic demographic details, including
their age, sex, whether they had prior experience of playing the
game Operation, and how they rated their handeeye coordination
on a five-point scale (1 ¼ terrible to 5 ¼ excellent). Participants
were then randomised using block randomisation to listen through
noise-cancelling headphones to one of three things: the sound
of an operating theatre (control condition), rock music (“Thun-
derstruck” from the aptly named album The razor’s edge by
Australian rock band AC/DC; tempo, about 134 bpm) or classical
music (Andante from Sonata for two pianos, K 448, by Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart; tempo, about 60 bpm). Participants were blind
as to what they would hear in the headphones, with the nature of
the three conditions only revealed to them after they had provided
all study data.
Participants were then given a (very) brief introduction to
multiorgan resection techniques and invited to perform the
surgery on the patient, Cavity Sam, by removing three plastic
pieces from his body in the game Operation (Hasbro; Box 2).
Abstract
Objective: Over the past few decades there has been interest in
the role of music in the operating theatre. However, despite
many reported benefits, a number of potentially harmful effects
of music have been identified. This study aimed to explore the
effects of rock and classical music on surgical speed, accuracy
and perceived distraction when performing multiorgan resection
in the board game Operation.
Design: Single-blind, three-arm, randomised controlled trial.
Setting: Imperial Festival, London, May 2016.
Participants: Members of the public (n ¼ 352) aged � 16 years
with no previous formal surgical training or hearing impairments.
Methods: Participants were randomised to listen through
noise-cancelling headphones to either the sound of an operating
theatre, rock music or classical music. Participants were then
invited to remove three organs from the board game patient,
Cavity Sam, using surgical tweezers.
Main outcome measures: Time taken (seconds) to remove
three organs from Cavity Sam; the number of mistakes made in
performing the surgery; and perceived distraction, rated on a
five-point Likert-type scale from 1 (not at all distracting) to 5
(very distracting).
Results: Rock music impairs the performance of men but
not women when undertaking complex surgical procedures in
the board game Operation, increasing the time taken to operate
and showing a trend towards more surgical mistakes. In addition,
classical music was associated with lower perceived
distraction during the game, but this effect was attenuated when
factoring in how much people liked the music, with suggestions
that only people who particularly liked the music of Mozart
found it beneficial.
Conclusions: Rock music (specifically Australian rock music)
appears to have detrimental effects on surgical performance.
Men are advised not to listen to rock music when either operating
or playing board games.

 Participants were instructed to make as few mistakes as possible in
order to increase the chances of Sam’s survival. Immediately after
completing the operation participants were asked to rate how
much they liked what they had heard on a five-point scale
(1 ¼ hated to 5 ¼ loved).
Outcome measures
The primary outcome measure was the length of time taken to
complete the operation, with secondary outcome measures of
how many mistakes participants made and how distracting they
rated the sound in their headphones. Immediately
after finishing the operation, participants were asked
to rate their perceived level of distraction on a five-
point Likert-type scale from 1 (not at all distracting)
to 5 (very distracting). Timing and mistakes were
logged through a microcontroller (Arduino) with a
serial
interface
to
a
graphical
user
interface
(MATLAB; MathWorks). Once the green “Go” button
was hit, a real-time clock on the microcontroller was
set to increment every 0.1 seconds. Mistakes, where
the metal tweezers touched the patient’s body rather
than the plastic pieces being removed, made a circuit
and triggered the buzzer, and were logged using an
analog-to-digital converter connected to the buzzer
circuit with an algorithm to ensure that mistakes were
only logged once. On finishing, participants pressed
the red “Finish” button so that no more mistakes were
logged and the current time was recorded. Data were
then
transmitted
over
a
serial
interface
to
the
graphical
user
interface,
where
the
number
of
mistakes and time were displayed for data collection. The yellow
“Reset” button was pressed to clear the counters before the next
participants took part.
Statistical analysis
Analyses were carried out using SPSS Statistics version 23 (IBM).
Because research has suggested that men and women like and
respond differently to different genres of music,10-12 analyses were
performed separately by sex. One-way analyses of variance and c2
tests were performed to compare differences in baseline between
the three aural conditions. Univariate analyses of variance
adjusted for age, game experience and handeeye coordination,
and post-hoc tests were used to compare the differences in oper-
ating speed, operating mistakes and perceived distraction between
the three conditions (operating theatre sounds, rock music and
classical music). Sensitivity analyses were also performed, using
the same univariate analyses of variance but additionally adjusting
for how much people liked the music to explore whether personal
preference influenced outcomes.

informed consent prior to participating.
Results
Groups were comparable among the three listening conditions at
baseline (Box 3). In addition, there were no differences in age or
game experience between men and women (c2 ¼ 0.759; df ¼ 1;
P ¼ 0.384), but there was a marginal difference in self-rated
handeeye coordination (c2 ¼ 9.661; df ¼ 4; P ¼ 0.047), with
women more confident in their abilities than men.
Operating speed
After adjusting for age, game experience and handeeye coordi-
nation, there was a significant difference in operating speed among
the conditions in men (F2,181 ¼ 4.236; P ¼ 0.016). Post-hoc tests
showed that rock music led to significantly slower operating speed
(mean, 80.8 s) than either classical music (mean, 66.2 s; P ¼ 0.012)
or the sound of the operating theatre (mean, 64.7 s; P ¼ 0.01).
Sensitivity analyses adding how much people liked the music into
the model showed comparable results (F2,179 ¼ 3.616; P ¼ 0.029);

 there was no significant difference between rock music and
classical music yet still a significant difference between rock music
and the sound of the operating theatre (P ¼ 0.012). In contrast,
there was no significant effect on operating speed found for women
(Box 4).
Operation mistakes
After
adjusting
for
age,
game
experience
and
handeeye
coordination, there was a near-significant difference in the number
of operating mistakes made among the conditions in men
(F2,173 ¼ 2.575; P ¼ 0.079). Post-hoc tests showed that rock music
led to more mistakes (mean, 35.7 mistakes) than classical music
(mean, 27.5 mistakes; P ¼ 0.034), with a near-significant difference
to the sounds of the operating theatre (mean, 28.1 mistakes;
P ¼ 0.068). Sensitivity analyses adding how much people liked the
music into the model led to the near-significant effects being
attenuated, suggesting that such effects were only found among
people
who
had
an
aversion
to
Oz
rock.
In
contrast,
there was no significant effect on operation mistakes found for
women (Box 4).
Distraction while operating
After
adjusting
for
age,
game
experience
and
handeeye
coordination, there was a significant difference in the reported
level of distraction for men and women among the conditions
(men:
F2,182 ¼ 14.757;
P < 0.001;
women:
F2,141 ¼ 3.694;
P ¼ 0.027). Post-hoc tests showed that men rated classical music
significantly less distracting (mean rating, 1.6/5) than either rock
music or the sound of the operating theatre (mean rating for
both, 2.6/5; P < 0.001), while women found classical music
significantly less distracting (mean rating, 1.6/5) than theatre
sounds (mean rating, 2.3/5; P ¼ 0.007) but not rock music (mean
rating, 2.0/5). However, sensitivity analyses adding how much
people liked the music into the model led to these effects being
attenuated in both men and women, suggesting that only people
who are partial to the music of Mozart find that it reduces their
distraction level and helps them to concentrate (Box 4).
Discussion
This study demonstrates for the first time that rock music,
specifically Australian rock music, has detrimental effects on men
but not women when pretending to be surgeons, increasing the
time taken to “operate” and showing a trend towards more
surgical mistakes. In particular, with operating speed, this effect
appears to be independent of how much people like rock music.
These data are concerning when considering the reported rate of
listening to music in operating theatres, the popularity of rock
music in these settings, and that men are reportedly more likely to
listen to music than women.4 These findings are contrary to the
benefits of rhythmic music noted by Siu and colleagues5 and also
fly in contrast to opinions expressed by music legends Britney

 Spears and will.i.am, who believe rock and roll leads to people
“going faster, we ain’t going slow-low-low”. However, the
findings are in line with those of Miskovic and colleagues,9 as well
as those of Conrad and colleagues,13 who found that dichaotic
music
(auditory
stress)
was
associated
with
slower
task
performance among surgeons in a laparoscopic simulator. Thus,
one possible explanation for our findings is that the music of
AC/DC is perceived by listeners as dichaotic.
Interestingly, this study also demonstrated no improvements in
speed or accuracy in either men or women listening to classical
music when operating. Although classical music was associated
with a lower perceived distraction during the game, this effect was
attenuated when factoring in how much people liked the music,
with suggestions that only people who are particular fans of
Mozart
found
it
beneficial.
This
lack
of improvement
in
performance when listening to Mozart does not support the
so-called Mozart effect, which suggests that Mozart’s compositions
can aid spatial task performance.14 However, given that several
studies have since thrown doubt onto the claims about the effect,
these data are actually in line with general research findings.15
There are some important limitations to this study. The two
pieces of music used had different tempi; it therefore remains
uncertain whether the genre itself or just the speed of music is
responsible for the effects noted. The study was also restricted to
just two pieces of music. It is possible that other popular music
genres such as electronic music by bands such as Daft Punk
might make surgeons “Harder, better, faster, stronger”, a view
supported by electro-pop band FM Belfast who claim “We are
faster than you”. In addition, caution should be applied when
generalising the findings from this study to real-life surgical
situations as, despite the genuine tension and feelings of
responsibility for the life of Cavity Sam generated by Operation,
it cannot be assumed to be a realistic surgical simulation
experience, and our participants had no prior surgical training or
experience. It is possible that rock music has different effects on
the performance of professional surgeons. However, following
the advice of progressive rock band La Dispute in their song
“The
surgeon
and
the
scientist”,
we
encourage
surgeons
to consider the findings of this study in their professional
practice: “Don’t call this an art project. This is science, this is
progress”.
Future research remains to be carried out to explore the full extent
of the negative impacts of Australian rock music on medical
professionals. For now, caution is advised for those tempted to
listen to Oz rock while undertaking high-risk tasks.
