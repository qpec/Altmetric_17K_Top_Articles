Lifestyle interventions incorporating both diet and exercise strategies remain cornerstone 
therapies for treating metabolic disease. Carbohydrate-restriction and high-intensity 
interval training (HIIT) have independently been shown to improve cardiovascular and 
metabolic health. Carbohydrate-restriction reduces postprandial hyperglycemia, thereby 
limiting potential deleterious metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of excessive 
glucose excursions. Additionally, carbohydrate-restriction has been shown to improve 
body composition and blood lipids. The benefits of exercise for improving insulin sen-
sitivity are well known. In this regard, HIIT has been shown to rapidly improve glucose 
control, endothelial function, and cardiorespiratory fitness. Here, we report the available 
evidence for each strategy and speculate that the combination of carbohydrate-restriction 
and HIIT will synergistically maximize the benefits of both approaches. We hypothesize 
that this lifestyle strategy represents an optimal intervention to treat metabolic disease; 
however, further research is warranted in order to harness the potential benefits of 
 
carbohydrate-restriction and HIIT for improving cardiometabolic health.

introdUCtion
Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is one of the fastest growing, yet largely preventable chronic diseases world-
wide (1). In addition to the hallmark feature of impaired glucose control, progression of T2D 
presents with a number of co-morbidities, increasing risk of premature mortality. Of particular 
concern is the high prevalence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD), which accounts for 
~80% of T2D-related co-morbidities (2, 3). Furthermore, a clustering of cardiovascular risk factors 
tend to manifest well before the diagnosis of T2D, accelerating the progression of CVD (4). These 
risk factors include central obesity, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia, collectively 
coined the metabolic syndrome (5). In addition, physical inactivity and/or low-cardiorespiratory 
fitness are emerging as important modifiable risk factors for CVD and T2D (6). Importantly, 
both exercise and dietary strategies can help prevent, or slow the progression of, T2D-related 
co-morbidities. In this regard, lifestyle interventions incorporating both diet and exercise prescrip-
tions remain at the frontline of therapeutic options for treating metabolic disease (7–9).
The main treatment goal of metabolic diseases, including T2D and the metabolic syndrome, 
is the prevention of atherosclerotic CVD (10, 11). To date, management of T2D and associated

co-morbidities depends upon pharmacological interventions 
and the implementation of lifestyle changes (9, 11). Generally, 
public health guidelines encourage weight loss by recommending 
a calorie-restricted diet that is low in fat and added sugar, as well 
as performing at least 150 min of moderate-intensity physical 
activity each week (10, 11). While this general approach may be 
effective for the prevention of T2D (12), it does not appear to 
prevent, or alleviate, the burden of CVD in those with overt T2D 
[(8), LOOK Ahead trial]. Given the significant burden of CVD 
and diabetes-related co-morbidities, novel intervention strate-
gies that can reduce cardiovascular risk factors, while imposing 
minimal side effects, are urgently sought after.
In the growing field of health and exercise science, a number of 
lifestyle approaches are currently gaining momentum. For example, 
dietary modifications such as carbohydrate-restriction and time-
restricted feeding (including intermittent fasting) are emerging as 
alternative treatment strategies for persons with, and at risk for, 
metabolic diseases. Likewise, novel exercise prescriptions including 
high-intensity interval training (HIIT), and the concept of breaking 
up sedentary time with light physical activity, have revealed sig-
nificant promise for improving or mitigating the deleterious effects 
of an inactive lifestyle. Innovative and effective strategies such as 
these have reaffirmed the strong influence of lifestyle modification 
on metabolic disease progression. While some of these individual 
approaches are beginning to inform public health guidelines (9), 
it is our belief that combining both diet and exercise modification 
will synergistically aid in the management of metabolic disease. In 
this regard, carbohydrate-restriction is loosely defined as restricting 
carbohydrates to less than 30% of caloric intake, and HIIT is char-
acterized by brief periods of high-intensity exercise interspersed 
with low-intensity exercise for recovery. We acknowledge there 
are several other promising lifestyle interventions that we have not 
mentioned, however, the focus of this paper is to highlight the pro-
pensity for synergistic effects when carbohydrate-restriction and 
HIIT are combined. As with any lifestyle intervention, adherence 
is critical, and behavior change research on how to implement and 
support both HIIT and carbohydrate-restriction is needed. Initial 
work on adherence to HIIT is showing promise (13) and low-CHO 
diets appear to have similar adherence to other diets (14), but it 
will be necessary to assess the tolerability and adherence to our 
hypothesized approach moving forward.
HypotHesis
In light of recent evidence, we hypothesize that the novel com-
bination of a carbohydrate-restricted diet and HIIT represents 
a promising lifestyle strategy for the treatment of T2D. The 
purpose of this Hypothesis & Theory piece is to briefly summarize 
the evidence that supports the individual therapeutic benefits of 
carbohydrate-restriction and HIIT, as well as present the idea 
that combining these approaches may represent the most potent 
lifestyle therapy for this costly disease.
CarBoHydrate-restriCtion in t2d
Due to the growing prevalence of metabolic disease and the 
apparent ineffectiveness of the current dietary guidelines 
 
(15, 16), alternative dietary approaches need to be considered. 
There is increasing evidence from scientific research [reviewed 
in Ref. (17)] and patient groups (UK Diabetes low-carb initiative; 
www.diabetes.org.uk) to support carbohydrate-restriction as a 
primary dietary treatment strategy for individuals with T2D. It has 
long been known that a diet high in carbohydrate elevates post-
prandial hyperglycemia and insulin responses, together accelerat-
ing the progression of T2D and atherosclerotic CVD (18–20). To 
this end, diets low in carbohydrate was recommended for T2D in 
1800s and during the early twentieth century. More recently, low-
carbohydrate diets are recognized in the ADA medical nutrition 
therapy guidelines (21) although the official dietary guidelines 
for individuals with T2D still do not advocate a low-carbohydrate 
approach. In comparison with standard low-fat caloric restric-
tive dietary interventions, energy-matched diets that restrict 
carbohydrates to <30 g/day have been shown to result in greater 
reductions in HbA1c and fat mass (22, 23), as well as superior 
improvements in the blood lipid profile (24, 25). Typically, low-
carbohydrate diets are not explicitly prescribed to be hypocaloric, 
but due to the satiating effects of protein and fat, energy intake 
is often lower (22, 26–28). However, while the energy intake is 
reduced relative to participant’s habitual intake or when a low-fat 
diet is prescribed, low-carbohydrate diets reduce energy intake 
relative to energy requirements (26–28). For example, Boden 
et al. (26) observed a 1,027 cal/day reduction in energy intake 
when patients with T2D followed an ad libitum low-carbohydrate 
diet for 14 days; interestingly, the energy intake was reduced to a 
level that was appropriate to their weight. Moreover, the benefits 
of low-carbohydrate diets can occur without weight loss (29, 30). 
For a comprehensive review of carbohydrate-restriction for the 
management of T2D, an interested reader is directed to Feinman 
et al. (28).
While optimal guidelines for carbohydrate-restriction are 
not established, a carbohydrate-restrictive diet generally con-
stitutes <30% of caloric intake from carbohydrate food-sources 
(approximating <130 g/day) (31). Very low-carbohydrate diets 
on the other hand, often referred to as ketogenic diets, involve 
more extreme reductions in carbohydrate of less than ~30 g/day 
 
to permit nutritional ketosis (32). The optimal amount of car-
bohydrate in the diet (degree of carbohydrate-restriction) likely 
depends on the state of insulin resistance of the individual. 
For example, Cornier et al. (33) reported greater weight loss in 
insulin-sensitive individuals following a high- compared with 
a low-carbohydrate hypocaloric diet, whereas the opposite was 
true for insulin-resistant individuals (i.e., greater weight loss and 
improved insulin sensitivity on a low-carbohydrate hypocaloric 
diet). The implications of this study are noteworthy, given that 
more than 35% of adults are insulin resistant (34). Therefore, 
speculatively, more insulin-resistant individuals, particularly 
those with T2D, may require greater degrees of carbohydrate-
restriction for diet-induced improvements in metabolic health.
In longer-term interventions, a carbohydrate-restricted diet 
appears highly effective at promoting weight loss in patients 
with T2D (25, 27, 35). This dietary strategy has also been shown 
to reduce visceral adiposity (22, 27, 36), and lower medication 
requirements in adults with T2D (25, 37). Such reductions in 
central adiposity, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia are

central to preventing the development of CVD (38). Importantly, 
even in the absence of weight loss, carbohydrate-restrictive diets 
have also been shown to improve glycemic control (29, 39). For 
example, Gannon and colleagues found that despite no change 
in total body mass, an isocaloric diet comprising 30% protein, 
50% fat, and 20% carbohydrate reduced HbA1c by 2% (absolute 
reduction) and improved fasting and postprandial blood glucose 
control in patients with T2D (30, 40). Such improvements in glu-
cose control in the absence of weight loss may be due to improved 
insulin sensitivity and/or beta-cell function. Indeed, Boden et al. 
(26) showed that just 2 weeks of an isocaloric low-carbohydrate 
diet improves insulin sensitivity by 75% in T2D individuals, using 
the gold standard hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique. 
Although we are unaware of any direct evidence for improved 
beta-cell function with carbohydrate-restriction in individuals 
with T2D, associative evidence supports that providing beta-cell 
rest by removing hyperglycemia can reverse the insulin secretory 
defects present in animal models of T2D (41, 42).
eXerCise in t2d: it is a Hiit!
Physical inactivity presents one of the greatest public health 
concerns of our time (43). Indeed inactivity, or perhaps more 
accurately termed insufficient physical activity, is the fourth 
leading cause of death (44). Physical activity is broadly defined 
as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle, encom-
passing both activities of daily living and structured exercise. 
Exercise is defined as purposeful physical activity carried out to 
sustain or improve health or fitness, and if provided in a sufficient 
stimulus (dependent upon intensity and duration) is very effec-
tive to improve cardiometabolic health (45). The protective and 
therapeutic effects of regular exercise for the prevention of many 
chronic diseases are well-established and have been comprehen-
sively reviewed by Pedersen and Saltin (46).
In order to achieve such health benefits, it is recommended 
that 150 min of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activ-
ity be performed each week. Perhaps one of the greatest health 
benefits of a regular exercise regimen is an improvement in 
cardiorespiratory fitness (47). Indeed, improving cardiorespira-
tory fitness is associated with a lower risk of both all-cause 
and CVD mortality (48, 49). The positive relationship between 
regular exercise and improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness 
appears to be intensity-dependent, however, with higher intensity 
exercise conferring larger improvements in fitness (50, 51). In 
fact, several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported 
that in comparison with moderate-intensity exercise, exercise 
performed at a higher intensity elicits greater improvements in 
markers of cardiovascular, and metabolic health in individuals 
with T2D (52–55). In agreement, a recent review by Baldi et al. 
(56), suggested that even public health guidelines, which recom-
mend moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT), may not 
provide a sufficient stimulus for improving cardiovascular func-
tion. Thus, performing exercise at a vigorous intensity (relative to 
the individuals baseline fitness level) may be required to improve 
cardiovascular and metabolic health (57).
High-intensity interval training, which involves alternating 
periods of relatively intense exercise with periods of rest or 
low-intensity exercise for recovery (58, 59), is an attractive strat-
egy enabling vigorous-intensity exercise to be incorporated in an 
exercise program. In comparison with MICT, HIIT is performed 
in an intermittent pattern, which results in only brief periods 
of relatively high-intensity effort, followed by recovery periods. 
Importantly, HIIT is a highly potent strategy to improve cardi-
orespiratory fitness (59). Indeed, a recent meta-analysis reported 
that HIIT-induced improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness 
were nearly one metabolic equivalent (+3 ml/kg/min) higher than 
in response to MICT in individuals with lifestyle induced chronic 
disease (59). Improvements of this magnitude correspond to a 
~15% greater risk reduction for CVD morality (49), highlighting 
the potency of HIIT for reducing cardiovascular risk.
Various iterations of HIIT have been tested in small trials 
of T2D patients with reported benefits to cardiorespiratory 
fitness, glucose control, hepatic fat, vascular function, and 
body composition. While direct comparisons with standard 
care MICT are less common, recent investigations have 
reported superior improvements in many of these risk fac-
tors following HIIT (59–61). For example, an HIIT protocol 
involving 4× 4 min intervals at ~90% of maximal aerobic 
capacity, interspersed with 3 min of recovery has consistently 
yielded superior cardiovascular adaptations compared with 
an energy-matched MICT protocol. Following 12 weeks of 
training, endothelial function (62, 63), diastolic and systolic 
function (63) as well as cardiorespiratory fitness (62–64) were 
improved to a greater extent following HIIT compared with 
MICT.
Given the prevailing hyperglycemia among patients with 
T2D, the impact of HIIT on glycemic control has received much 
attention (63–66). In a landmark study, Karstoft et al. (65, 67) 
compared 60 min of interval-walking 5 days per week, to an 
energy-expenditure matched continuous-walking protocol in 
T2D. The interval-walking group performed 3 min periods of 
fast walking (above 70% VO2peak), followed by 3 min of slow 
walking (below 70% VO2peak) for 60 min three times per week, 
while the continuous protocol involved 60 min of walking at 55% 
VO2peak. Following 16 weeks of training, the interval-walking 
group displayed greater reductions in mean 24-h blood glucose 
concentration assessed with continuous glucose monitor-
ing, which were accompanied by superior improvements in 
cardiorespiratory fitness and body composition. In a follow-up 
publication in the same participants, authors reported improved 
insulin sensitivity in the interval-walking group only, as meas-
ured by hyperglycemic clamp with glucose tracers. These superior 
improvements in glucose control are reinforced by a recent meta-
analysis demonstrating that HIIT improves fasting blood glucose 
and HbAIc to a greater extent than MICT in individuals at risk for, 
or afflicted with, T2D (60). Specifically, in those with T2D, HIIT 
was found to lower fasting glucose and HbA1c by 0.92 mmol/l 
and 0.5%, respectively, which is of comparable magnitude to 
pharmacological-induced improvements in glycemia (68). The 
pronounced improvements in glucose control following HIIT 
are likely mediated by many factors, some of which may include 
greater beta-cell function (67, 69), improved skeletal muscle 
insulin signaling (62, 67), and reductions in total body (62, 64, 65) 
and hepatic (66, 70) fat content.

While these findings are compelling, the time commitment 
associated with many HIIT protocols is often higher (150–
300 min/week) than that obtained by the general population, 
which questions whether such exercise is attainable for many 
individuals who report a “lack of time” as a barrier to regular 
exercise (71). With this in mind, low-volume HIIT protocols 
involving a reduced exercise volume and time commitment 
may represent a viable strategy. We have previously shown 
that 2 weeks of HIIT involving six sessions of 10× 60 s cycling 
intervals at ~90% of maximal heart rate, interspersed with 60 s 
of rest, improved 24-h mean blood glucose concentration, and 
lowered postprandial glucose excursions in patients with T2D 
(72). Using this same protocol, Madsen et al. (69) reported a 
0.5% reduction in HbA1c and increased glucose tolerance and 
beta-cell function after 8 weeks of training in T2D. In addition to 
improvements in glycemic control, we (73) and others (74) have 
reported increases in cardiorespiratory fitness and total body 
lean mass as well as reductions in body fat following 12 weeks 
of low-volume HIIT in patients with T2D. These findings are 
quite intriguing, given that total exercise time was only ~30 min/
week within a 75-min weekly time commitment. Importantly, 
low-volume HIIT has been reported to be enjoyable (13, 75, 76), 
which may be attributable to the low-time commitment and/or 
short interval duration (77).
The mechanisms by which HIIT improves metabolic and 
cardiovascular health are likely multifaceted, and may relate to 
the high rates of muscle fiber recruitment, rapid muscle glycogen 
depletion, and repetitive shear stress during exercise (78, 79). The 
intermittent cardiorespiratory and metabolic demands imposed 
also appear to be important in regulating chronic adaptations 
to HIIT (79). Indeed, it has been suggested that training with 
alternating intensity, and not solely measuring training volume 
and mean intensity, is important for improving cardiovascular 
and metabolic health in individuals with T2D (65, 67, 80).

While the independent improvements in cardiometabolic health 
following carbohydrate-restriction and HIIT have been well 
investigated, the combined impact of these lifestyle strategies in 
patients with T2D has yet to be explored. It is our hypothesis 
that supplementing a carbohydrate-restrictive diet with HIIT, or 
likewise, strategically limiting carbohydrate availability during 
HIIT, may enhance the therapeutic effects of either interven-
tion alone (Figure 1). Specifically, we believe that a combined

approach will synergistically improve the acute and chronic 
regulation of glycemic control and endothelial function while 
maximally improving cardiorespiratory fitness, resulting in the 
optimal lifestyle strategy to limit the progression of T2D, and 
related co-morbidities.
adding Hiit to a Carbohydrate-restrictive 
diet
While a carbohydrate-restrictive diet effectively reduces hyper-
glycemic excursions and improves glycemic control in patients 
with T2D (29, 39), a perceived limitation of this dietary approach 
is that it is inevitably higher in dietary fat. Studies in rodents (81, 
82) and epidemiology evidence in humans suggests that a high-
fat diet (which is also low in carbohydrate) promotes insulin 
resistance (83, 84). Specifically, it appears that in the short-term, 
high-fat diets (for ≤1 week) in humans may impair glucose tol-
erance (when tested by providing a high-glucose load), at least 
from trials in healthy adults (85, 86). In healthy insulin-sensitive 
participants, a reduction in insulin sensitivity and/or glucose 
tolerance following a switch to a low-carbohydrate high-fat 
diet is likely an adaptive response as the body transitions over 
to higher baseline fat utilization (87, 88). However, individuals 
with obesity and insulin resistance experience some degree of 
metabolic inflexibility; an inability to modulate daily fat and 
carbohydrate oxidation based upon substrate availability (89). 
Consequently, exaggerated blood glucose and lipid responses to 
meals are prevalent in individuals with insulin resistance (90). 
This suggests that if one is to follow a low-carbohydrate diet, it 
must be followed consistently (i.e., no “cheating” or consumption 
of high-glycemic index foods) or that exercise should be incor-
porated to mitigate any detrimental effects on insulin sensitivity. 
Indeed, the most important determinant of the effectiveness 
of dietary interventions is adherence (91). However, we have 
shown that a single session of low-volume HIIT performed after 
breakfast lowers postprandial glucose excursions throughout 
the day in patients with T2D (92) and “small snacks” of interval 
exercise distributed before meals significantly lowers postpran-
dial hyperglycemia and mean glucose concentration over 24 h 
(93). Therefore, exercise, of a sufficient stimulus, strategically 
timed to dispose of postprandial glucose and/or to increase fat 
utilization is a highly effective strategy to reduce postprandial 
excursions. In considering the glycemic response to a meal is 
primarily determined by the quantity and type of carbohydrate 
(94), restricting carbohydrate inevitably will lower postprandial 
glucose and insulin excursions (95, 96). Thus, it would appear 
that the combination of carbohydrate-restriction with HIIT 
may promote synergistic improvements for acutely reducing 
postprandial glucose spikes, increasing muscle glucose uptake, 
and augmenting insulin sensitivity.
Furthermore, exercising before or after a high-fat meal has 
been shown to ameliorate the detrimental effects on endothelial 
function (97–99). Endothelial function is an important prog-
nostic indicator of cardiovascular health as the endothelium is 
the barrier protecting the artery from thrombosis, inflamma-
tion, and stiffening (100, 101). Postprandial increases in lipids 
and glucose are independent risk factors for CVD (102). The 
postprandial impairment in endothelial function may be related 
to excessive postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, inflammation, 
and oxidative stress following the meal (103, 104). Given that 
several studies have supported the notion that “high-fat” meals 
[which are often also high in refined carbohydrate (105–107)] 
can promote endothelial dysfunction, there appears to be some 
apprehension around adopting a low-carbohydrate high-fat diet. 
However, this is despite the fact that high-carbohydrate meals 
can elicit similar dysmetabolism and endothelial dysfunction 
(105). Regardless, if a typical low-carbohydrate high-fat meal 
does acutely impair endothelial function this may not be an ideal 
strategy for participants at elevated CVD risk. However, Tyldum 
et al. (99) reported that a single bout of HIIT, but not MICT, 
performed ~16-h prior to a high-fat meal protected against 
endothelial dysfunction. Interestingly, this was tightly related 
to exercise-induced increases in antioxidant capacity with HIIT, 
as measured by the colorimetric total antioxidant capacity assay 
(99). Tjønna et al. (108) also showed that endothelial function 
and nitric oxide bioavailability were increased ~72 h after an 
acute session of HIIT in individuals with T2D. Collectively, 
it appears that exercise can negate the detrimental effects of a 
high-fat meal on endothelial function, with HIIT as a promising 
strategy to improve endothelial function. Therefore, strategically 
timing HIIT sessions could reduce any potential negative effects 
of low-carbohydrate high-fat meals that are often incorporated 
into carbohydrate-restricted meal plans.
Lastly, over the long term, reductions in fat mass and 
increases in lean mass appear critical for sustained improve-
ments in metabolic health following lifestyle interventions (109, 
110). In this regard, the combination of diet and exercise may 
be superior for preserving lean mass and reducing body fat in 
patients with T2D (111, 112). Energy restriction interventions, 
in the absence of exercise, often result in the loss of lean body 
mass in addition to fat loss (113, 114). Given the strong relation-
ship between lean body mass, metabolic health, and functional 
capacity (115), preserving lean body mass with exercise during 
any energy-restricted diet (whether low-carbohydrate or not) is 
of primary importance. Moreover, preserving lean body mass 
in individuals with T2D is particularly important given the 
accelerated loss of skeletal muscle with insulin resistance, and 
the concomitant worsening of glycemic control with decreased 
skeletal muscle mass (116, 117). In view of this, HIIT has recently 
been shown to increase skeletal muscle protein synthesis of 
young and older adults, an effect linked to improved insulin 
sensitivity, and mitochondrial function (118). Relative to MICT 
and resistance training, HIIT resulted in the greatest increase 
in gene expression for mitochondrial function, muscle growth, 
and insulin signaling pathways in older adults (118). In both 
obese adults and those with and T2D, HIIT has been shown to 
reduce fat mass and increase lean mass (62, 64, 65, 69, 73, 74). 
Although the impact of a low-carbohydrate diet combined with 
HIIT has not been adequately studied, there is evidence that 
a low-carbohydrate diet promotes favorable changes in body 
composition when combined with resistance training in women 
with obesity (119). Thus, the combination of HIIT with a low-
carbohydrate diet may help to preserve or increase lean mass in 
individuals with T2D.

eXerCise and nUtrient 
interaCtions: adding 
CarBoHydrate-restriCtion to Hiit
It is well known that nutrient ingestion in-and-around the exer-
cise period impacts the molecular signaling and thus metabolic 
responses to exercise (120). Accumulating evidence has revealed 
that nutrient availability, in addition to exercise components 
(e.g., mode, intensity, and duration), play a putative role in 
determining the adaptive response to exercise training (121). 
Indeed energy status (whether surplus or deficit) has been shown 
to modify the neuroendocrine, acute molecular signaling, and 
gene transcription response to exercise (121, 122). For example, 
low-skeletal muscle glycogen prior to exercise augments AMPK 
signaling and up-regulates the transcription of PGC1a and 
mitochondrial enzymes (123–125). It has also been suggested 
that delaying glycogen restoration after exercise may enhance the 
adaptive response for proteins involved in glucose uptake (i.e., 
glucose transporter GLUT-4) (126, 127). Therefore, restricting 
carbohydrates and/or training fasted may increase the adaptive 
(i.e., training-induced increase in metabolic signaling) response 
to exercise (121, 128, 129). In contrast, providing carbohydrate 
in proximity to exercise can in fact blunt the activation of key 
regulatory genes for metabolizing fat postexercise (123). Thus, 
it is tempting to speculate that combining HIIT with a low-
carbohydrate diet in T2D could enhance molecular signaling and 
metabolic adaptations in skeletal muscle.
In support of this, Newsom et al. (130) reported that an energy 
deficit after exercise does not contribute to the exercised-induced 
improvements in insulin sensitivity if ample carbohydrate is pro-
vided. However, withholding carbohydrate (but providing ample 
energy) postexercise resulted in improved insulin sensitivity the 
following day. Furthermore, restricting carbohydrate before and 
between interval training sessions has been shown to augment 
the cellular signaling and upregulate skeletal muscle metabolic 
enzyme adaptations in young healthy participants (131, 132). 
This suggests that strategically restricting carbohydrate during 
HIIT could potentiate exercise-induced skeletal muscle adapta-
tions in patients with T2D. To our knowledge, however, this 
strategy has not been examined in clinical populations. In the 
only study we are aware of, Sartor et al. (133) reported increased 
resting fat oxidation and cardiorespiratory fitness following a 
2-week HIIT plus carbohydrate-restricted diet intervention in 
obese men. However, changes in insulin sensitivity and glucose 
control were not reported and thus future long-term studies are 
warranted.
perspeCtiVes For FUtUre researCH
Carbohydrate-restriction and HIIT have independently been 
shown to improve several indices of cardiometabolic health. Taken 
together, it is our opinion that an adjunct therapy incorporating 
both carbohydrate-restriction and HIIT would be a particularly 
effective treatment for metabolic and CVDs (Figure 1). However 
promising, several key questions require further research, namely 
(i) the level of carbohydrate-restriction that is effective, safe, and 
feasible for different individuals over the long-term and (ii) the 
most effective HIIT protocol to complement a carbohydrate-
restrictive diet. For example, low-volume HIIT protocols have 
been shown to improve a host of cardiometabolic risk factors, 
and are well-tolerated and enjoyed by individuals with T2D (13, 
70, 73), however, future research on the integration of HIIT with 
carbohydrate-restriction is needed. In this regard, using rating 
of perceived exertion as an indication of exercise intensity may 
be more appropriate than heart rate (70) given the tolerance to 
HIIT during carbohydrate-restriction may be reduced. Sartor 
et al. (133) showed promising effects of carbohydrate-restriction 
with interval training (4× 4-min intervals) over 14 days in obese 
individuals. However, further research is needed in this area to 
determine the exercise dose that is feasible and well-tolerated 
during carbohydrate-restriction. In this regard and with the 
advancement of personalized and precision medicine, the devel-
opment of an algorithm that could be used to adjust the level 
of carbohydrate-restriction and corresponding HIIT protocol 
according to age, underlying insulin resistance, fitness, prefer-
ence, and genetics could prove useful. Considering there are 
many effective HIIT protocols, the “optimal” protocol may in fact 
be based on preference rather than physiology.
ConCLUsion: Hiit WitH 
CarBoHydrate-restriCtion:  
an optiMaL CoMBination For 
indiVidUaLs WitH t2d?
We hypothesize that the combination of HIIT with a carbohydrate-
restrictive diet may be the most effective strategy to reduce hyper-
glycemia, improve insulin sensitivity, promote favorable changes in 
body composition, and preserve (or increase) endothelial function 
in patients with T2D. While the combination of diet and exercise for 
the treatment of T2D is self-evident, the optimal combination is yet 
to be determined. Strategically timing HIIT in proximity to low-car-
bohydrate high-fat meals may synergistically maximize the benefits 
of both approaches, as well as minimize any potential negative effects 
of postprandial lipemia if one is following a low-carbohydrate high-
fat diet. Such a strategy is indeed testable and warranted to improve 
cardiometabolic health and reduce cardiovascular risk in T2D.
