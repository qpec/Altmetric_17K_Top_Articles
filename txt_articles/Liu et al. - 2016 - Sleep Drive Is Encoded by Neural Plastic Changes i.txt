SUMMARY
Prolonged wakefulness leads to an increased pres-
sure for sleep, but how this homeostatic drive is
generated and subsequently persists is unclear.
Here, from a neural circuit screen in Drosophila,
we identify a subset of ellipsoid body (EB) neurons
whose activation generates sleep drive. Patch-
clamp analysis indicates these EB neurons are
highly
sensitive
to
sleep
loss,
switching
from
spiking to burst-firing modes. Functional imaging
and translational profiling experiments reveal that
elevated sleep need triggers reversible increases
in cytosolic Ca2+ levels, NMDA receptor expression,
and structural markers of synaptic strength, sug-
gesting these EB neurons undergo ‘‘sleep-need’’-
dependent plasticity. Strikingly, the synaptic plas-
ticity of these EB neurons is both necessary and
sufficient for generating sleep drive, indicating that
sleep pressure is encoded by plastic changes
within this circuit. These studies define an integrator
circuit for sleep homeostasis and provide a mecha-
nism explaining the generation and persistence of
sleep drive.
INTRODUCTION
The concept of homeostasis for maintaining stability of an ani-
mal’s ‘‘internal milieu’’ was first articulated more than 150 years
ago (Cannon, 1929). These principles are also relevant for moti-
vated behaviors that are regulated by homeostatic drive (Ber-
ridge, 2004). Sleep is an archetypal example of such a
behavior—prolonged wakefulness increases sleep drive (sleep
pressure), resulting in an increase in sleep amount and/or depth
(‘‘sleep rebound’’) (Borbe
´ ly, 1982). However, despite intense
scrutiny for more than a century, the mechanisms underlying
this process and the nature of sleep drive itself remain unclear.
In addition, homeostatic regulation of motivated behaviors,
such as feeding or sleeping, typically occurs over a long period
(Berridge, 2004; Borbe
´ ly, 1982); substantial accumulation of
sleep drive in many animals takes hours of wakefulness and
is often maintained for hours even after sleep is initiated
(Daan et al., 1984; Huber et al., 2000, 2004). Therefore, unrav-
eling the processes encoding sleep drive requires an under-
standing of both how sleep drive is generated and how it
persists.
Most work on sleep drive has centered on extracellular sleep
regulatory substances (SRSs), such as adenosine, whose levels
rise with prolonged wakefulness in specific regions of the brain
(‘‘somnogen model’’) (Brown et al., 2012). These SRSs have
traditionally been proposed to act on dedicated circuits that
directly promote sleep or wakefulness in mammals, such as
the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), median preoptic nu-
cleus (MnPO), or specific acetylcholinergic nuclei (Methippara
et al., 2005; Porkka-Heiskanen et al., 1997). In this model, sleep
drive is generated by the accumulation of these SRSs, or ‘‘som-
nogens,’’ in the extracellular space (Brown et al., 2012). How-
ever, the half-lives of these SRSs are typically much shorter (mi-
nutes) (Jonzon and Fredholm, 1985; Pettipher et al., 2007) than
the time course for dissipating sleep pressure (hours), raising
the possibility that, rather than directly encoding sleep pressure,
these SRSs act as effectors of sleep drive to promote sleep (Be-
nington and Heller, 1995).
From an engineering perspective, homeostatic systems
require three components: (1) a sensor that periodically samples
the state variable, (2) an integrator that processes this informa-
tion to determine homeostatic drive, and (3) an effector that re-
sponds to this drive by directly manipulating the state variables
(Enderle and Bronzino, 2012). Thus, general design principles
predict that, for sleep homeostasis, central circuits should exist
that both encode the amount of sleep pressure and play a crucial
role in mediating the perdurance of such sleep drive. However,
such circuits have not been previously found.
Here, from a large-scale forward screen of neuronal driver
lines in Drosophila, we identify a neural circuit capable of gener-
ating sleep drive. Remarkably, activation of this circuit induces
sleep pressure and persistent sleep behavior, even in fully rested
animals. Conversely, neuronal silencing experiments reveal a
specific requirement for this circuit in sleep homeostasis.
Patch-clamp analysis demonstrates that this circuit is highly
sensitive to changes in sleep need. Importantly, we find that
intracellular Ca2+ levels and the synaptic strength of this circuit
not only tightly correlate with, but are also able to specifically
manipulate, the level of homeostatic sleep drive. Finally, cell-
specific translational profiling reveals significant upregulation
of NMDA receptors in this circuit following sleep deprivation,
and we show that this upregulation is a key mechanism medi-
ating ‘‘sleep-need’’-dependent plastic changes in this circuit

 and, ultimately, the generation of sleep drive. Together, our data
suggest a model whereby sleep pressure is encoded by plastic
changes within a dedicated homeostatic integrator circuit,
providing a mechanistic explanation for the generation and
persistence of sleep drive.
RESULTS
Identification of a Neuronal Circuit that Induces Sleep
Drive
Drosophila is an established genetic model system for studying
sleep and shares similar sleep-regulatory mechanisms with ver-
tebrates (Cirelli, 2009; Sehgal and Mignot, 2011). For example,
sleep in fruit flies is regulated by both the circadian clock and ho-
meostatic sleep drive (Donlea et al., 2014; Kunst et al., 2014; Liu
et al., 2014), and specific monoaminergic nuclei directly promote
arousal and can do so by inhibiting specific sleep-promoting cir-
cuits (Liu et al., 2012; Ueno et al., 2012). Thus, to study neural cir-
cuit mechanisms regulating sleep and wakefulness, we conduct-
ed a large-scale neuronal driver screen in Drosophila. 505 Gal4
drivers that together cover most neuropils of the fly brain were
selected from the Rubin/Janelia Farm collection (Jenett et al.,
2012) based upon the sparseness of their expression patterns.
Using these drivers, we conditionally activated different subsets
of neurons with the heat-activated cation channel dTrpA1 (Ham-
ada et al., 2008) for 12 hr during the night, and measured sleep
amount during that night and during the following day after
cessation of dTrpA1 activation (Figure 1). Sleep amount during
and after dTrpA1 activation generally displayed an inverse rela-
tionship reflecting sleep homeostasis (Figure 1A). For example,
wake-promoting drivers such as R52B10-Gal4 tended to induce
significant ‘‘sleep rebound’’ after dTrpA1 activation had ended
(Figures 1A–1D and S1A). From this screen, we identified multi-
ple sleep-promoting drivers that express in the ExFl2 neurons,
including R72G06-Gal4 and R12G09-Gal4 (Figures 1A–1D,
S1C, and S1D). These neurons have recently been shown to
act as a sleep ‘‘effector’’ circuit, whose activation directly in-
duces sleep in Drosophila (Donlea et al., 2011, 2014), thus vali-
dating our approach.
To our surprise, we found several lines that markedly violated
the inverse relationship between sleep amount during and after
dTrpA1 activation (Figures 1A–1D, S1A, S1B, and S1E–S1G).
These drivers strongly induced sleep after dTrpA1 activation
had ceased but tended to also increase sleep during activation.
Analysis of the expression patterns of these eight drivers indi-
cated that a specific group of ellipsoid body (EB) ring neu-
rons—the R2 neurons—was illuminated by the majority of these
drivers (Figures 1E, 1F, and S1E). We first focused on one of
these drivers, R69F08-Gal4, since it had the most specific
expression pattern in the central brain (Figure 1G). The inactivity
observed following dTrpA1 activation did not persist the
following day, suggesting that it was not secondary to neural
injury (Figure S1B). To further confirm that the daytime inactivity
observed following heat activation of R69F08-Gal4 > UAS-
dTrpA1 animals was due to sleep and not paralysis or locomotor
impairment, we performed a series of control experiments. This
quiescence behavior was reversible and associated with an
increased arousal threshold (Figure 1H), suggesting that these
animals were asleep and not paralyzed. Waking activity of these
R69F08-Gal4 > UAS-dTrpA1 flies after being fully aroused (>2-g
stimulation for 5 s) at ZT2 (Zeitgeber time 2) was similar to con-
trol flies, indicating these flies did not have locomotor impair-
ment following dTrpA1 activation (Figure S1H). To ensure that
the flies were truly inactive, and not simply grooming or feeding,
we performed video analysis of R69F08-Gal4 > UAS-dTrpA1
flies and manually scored their behavior for the 2 hr after dTrpA1
activation. As expected, we found that these flies spent the
majority of the 2 hr immobile and only a minor fraction of their
time grooming or feeding (immobile: 80.0% ± 1.9%; grooming:
9.6% ± 1.2%; feeding: 3.7% ± 0.8%, n = 15). The sleep behavior
elicited by activation of the R2 cells led to deeper sleep
compared to controls (Figure 1H). Moreover, after being briefly
awakened at ZT2 (2 hr after cessation of dTrpA1 activation),
these R69F08-Gal4 > UAS-dTrpA1 flies were more likely to
return to sleep, and to do so more quickly (Figure 1I), further
indicating increased sleep propensity after dTrpA1 activation.
Similar data were obtained for an independent driver (R58H05-
Gal4) that also drives expression in these R2 neurons (Figures
1C, 1D, 1H, and 1I). Because increases in sleep amount and
depth are hallmarks of increased homeostatic sleep drive (Bor-
be
´ ly, 1982; Huber et al., 2004), and, because these phenotypes
occur following cessation of neural activation, these data
strongly suggest that activating R2 neurons genetically induces
persistent sleep drive.

protocerebrum. Although the ExFl2 neurons are shown as the sole target of R2 signaling, additional downstream sleep ‘‘effector’’ circuits may exist.

 R2 Neurons Are Required for Generating Homeostatic
Sleep Drive
To address whether the R2 circuit is also required for generating
homeostatic sleep drive, we assessed whether silencing these
neurons impaired sleep recovery following sleep deprivation.
Expression of tetanus toxin (TNT) (Sweeney et al., 1995),
which inhibits neurotransmitter release, in R2 neurons using
three restricted Gal4 drivers (R69F08-Gal4, R58H05-Gal4, or
R30G03-Gal4) markedly reduced ‘‘rebound sleep’’ following me-
chanical sleep deprivation (Figures 2A and 2B). In addition, sleep
depth following sleep deprivation was reduced, compared to
control animals (Figure 2C). In contrast, when TNT was ex-
pressed using two drivers that appeared to induce sleep pres-
sure in our screen, but do not contain R2 neurons (R35D04-
Gal4 and R59B03-Gal4; Figure S1E), sleep rebound was not
significantly affected (Figure 2B). R27G06-Gal4 was not tested
in this assay, since it was lethal in combination with UAS-TNT.
Importantly, inactivation of these R2 ring neurons did not signif-
icantly affect baseline sleep, indicating a specific role for these
neurons in the homeostatic regulation of sleep (Figures S2A–
S2C). Together with our neural activation data, these findings
indicate that this R2 circuit is both necessary and sufficient for
homeostatic regulation of sleep.
The R2 Circuit Acts Upstream of a Sleep-Promoting
Circuit to Regulate Sleep Homeostasis
If the R2 circuit encodes physiological sleep drive, one would
expect it to act upstream of a sleep ‘‘effector’’ circuit. In flies,
recent data indicate that the ExFl2 neurons, which project to
the dorsal fan-shaped body, act as an ‘‘effector’’ circuit that
directly promotes sleep in response to increases in sleep drive
(Donlea et al., 2014). Therefore, we asked whether the R2 circuit
we identified acts upstream of the ExFl2 circuit in the homeostat-
ic regulation of sleep (Figure 2D). To address this question, we
blocked neurotransmitter release from the ExFl2 neurons using
the LexA/LexAop system (Lai and Lee, 2006) and assessed sleep
following activation of R2 neurons using the Gal4/UAS system.
The R72G06-LexA line drives expression in the ExFl2 neurons,
and we confirmed that thermogenetic activation of these neu-
rons using dTrpA1 promoted sleep (Figures S2D–S2F), similar
to R72G06-Gal4 (Figure 1) and other previously described
ExFl2 drivers (Donlea et al., 2011). As before, nighttime activation
of the R2 neurons using the R69F08-Gal4 driver (WT >LexAop-
TNT; R69F08-Gal4 > UAS-dTrpA1) led to ‘‘rebound’’-like sleep
during the following day. This phenotype was largely reduced
when ExFl2 neurotransmission was simultaneously inhibited
(R72G06-LexA > LexAop-TNT; R69F08-Gal4 > UAS-dTrpA1)
(Figures 2E and 2F), consistent with the notion that the R2 neu-
rons promote sleep via the ExFl2 neurons. To examine potential
functional connectivity between the R2 and ExFl2 neurons, we
used two binary systems to simultaneously express ATP-gated
P2X2 receptors (Lima and Miesenbo
¨ ck, 2005) in R2 neurons
and GCaMP6s in ExFl2 neurons. As shown in Figure 2G, activa-
tion of the R2 neurons by application of ATP induced a substan-
tial increase in GCaMP signal in ExFl2 neurons in experimental
flies, but not control flies lacking P2X2 receptors in R2 neurons.
Together, these data strongly suggest that the R2 neurons act
upstream of the ExFl2 neurons in the homeostatic regulation of
sleep.
The Activity and Excitability of R2 Neurons Is Enhanced
following Prolonged Wakefulness
The preceding data suggest that sleep drive is generated within
the R2 circuit. To address whether the functional properties of
these neurons are altered with sleep need, we performed
patch-clamp recordings from these neurons at different time
points and following sleep deprivation (Figure 3A). Because
these neurons have not previously been characterized electro-
physiologically, we first tried different recording configurations.
We found that these R2 cells were amenable to perforated
patch-clamp recordings using beta-escin (Sarantopoulos et al.,
2004), which was preferred because of the importance of intra-
cellular Ca2+ in these neurons (see below). Two classes of neu-
rons within the R2 cluster were identified: one class exhibited
spontaneous action potential (AP) firing, while the other ap-
peared to be non-spiking in nature. We focused on the spiking
cells, because they constituted the majority (�92%) of neurons
in the R2 cluster. Under baseline conditions, we recorded from
two time points: ZT0-ZT2 (when sleep pressure should be low)
and ZT13-ZT15 (when sleep pressure should be moderately
elevated). We found that the spontaneous AP firing rate of the
R2 neurons was increased �3-fold at ZT13-ZT15, compared to
ZT0-ZT2. Moreover, following sleep deprivation, the sponta-
neous AP firing rate further increased, compared to rested flies
assessed at ZT0-ZT2 (Figures 3B and 3D). Strikingly, bursting
events were seen in the majority (75%) of recordings from
sleep-deprived flies, but never seen under baseline conditions
at ZT0-ZT2 or ZT13-ZT15 (Figures 3C and 3D), suggesting a
switch to a ‘‘potentiated’’ state after sleep loss. Furthermore,
evoked AP firing rates were higher at most (for ZT13-ZT15) and
all (for sleep-deprived) measured depolarizing currents versus
those at ZT0-ZT2 (Figures 3E and 3F). The resting membrane
potential of R2 neurons was also more depolarized in animals
following sleep deprivation, while input resistance was not
altered (Figures S3A and S3B). Together, these data indicate
that the activity and excitability of the R2 circuit increase under
conditions of greater sleep need and that these neurons exhibit
burst firing specifically following sleep deprivation.
Structural Plastic Changes in the R2 Circuit Correlate
with Sleep Pressure
The switch to a ‘‘burst’’ firing pattern in R2 neurons of sleep-
deprived animals suggests not only a change in their intrinsic
cellular properties, but also raises the possibility of plastic

 changes within these cells (Moore et al., 2009). In support of this
concept, some of the electrophysiological data in Figure 3 were
obtained 1–2 hr after the end of sleep deprivation, suggesting
persistence of this phenotype. Given that plastic changes in syn-
aptic strength could be an elegant mechanism for encoding the
build-up and persistence of sleep drive, we investigated whether
structural markers of synaptic strength changed in R2 cells
following sleep deprivation. To do this, we used the STaR (Syn-
aptic Tagging with Recombination) system (Chen et al., 2014),
which enables labeling of active zones specifically within a
defined circuit, by tagging native Bruchpilot (BRP) in a flippase
(FLP)/flippase recombinase target (FRT)-dependent manner.
Changes in BRP levels are a key mechanism underlying activ-
ity-dependent plasticity in adult neurons (Sugie et al., 2015),
and changes in synaptic structure, and both number and size
of active zones in particular, are generally associated with

 changes in synaptic strength (Holderith et al., 2012; Weyhers-
mu
¨ ller et al., 2011). Two hours after mechanical sleep deprivation
had ended, BRP signal in the R2 ring structure was significantly
increased in sleep-deprived flies compared to rested control flies
(Figures 4A–4C), and this greater BRP signal was due to in-
creases in both the number and size of BRP puncta in the R2
ring (Figure 4D). Similar data were obtained using an indepen-
dent thermogenetic method for inducing sleep deprivation (Fig-
ures S3E and S3F). When sleep drive is dissipated following
24 hr of recovery sleep, the increased BRP signal is lowered
to levels seen in rested control animals (Figures 4B and 4C),
demonstrating that these changes are reversible. In contrast,
increased BRP signal following sleep deprivation was not
observed in other neurons in the brain, including antennal lobe
local interneurons, ExFl2 neurons, and R3 ring neurons, suggest-
ing specificity to this phenotype (Figures 4B, 4C, S3C, and S3D).

 antennal lobe structure was assessed using anti-BRP antibodies
in that study, compared to our examination of specific antennal
lobe interneurons using the STaR system. Together, these data
argue that levels of molecular markers of synaptic strength in
the R2 neurons correlate with levels of sleep drive and suggest
that ‘‘sleep-need’’-dependent plastic changes in the R2 circuit
may be relevant for generating homeostatic sleep drive.
Cytosolic Ca2+ Levels in R2 Neurons Signify Levels of
Sleep Drive
Experimental evidence and theoretical models suggest a crucial
role for intracellular Ca2+ levels in driving neural plasticity (Ber-
ridge, 1998; O’Leary et al., 2014). Therefore, we next asked
whether intracellular Ca2+ levels in the R2 neurons also correlate
with different levels of sleep drive. To measure Ca2+ levels over
the course of multiple hours, we used the CaLexA (Calcium-
dependent nuclear import of LexA) system (Masuyama et al.,
2012). This system drives expression of GFP in response to sus-
tained increases in cytosolic Ca2+. We used a strong R2 driver
(R30G03-Gal4) to drive CaLexA in R2 neurons and also
examined the signal in other neurons labeled by this driver as
an internal control. After 24 hr of mechanical sleep deprivation
(Figure 5A), the GFP signal in the R2 ring structure was substan-
tially higher in sleep-deprived flies compared to control flies,
while the signal intensity in other neuropil structures, such as
the Fan-shaped body, was unchanged (Figures 5B and 5C).
Similar data were obtained using another R2 neuron-containing
driver (R58H05-Gal4) (Figure 5D). These data suggest that Ca2+
levels are specifically increased within R2 neurons following
sleep deprivation. To rule out the possibility that the increased
CaLexA signal in R2 neurons was caused solely by mechanical
stimulation and not a change in sleep pressure per se, we me-
chanically sleep deprived flies for only 12 hr during the subjective
day (when flies are mostly awake) versus subjective night (when
flies are generally asleep) and assessed CaLexA signal in the R2
neurons. When R30G03-Gal4 > CaLexA animals were mechani-
cally sleep deprived during the subjective nighttime, the CaLexA
signal in the R2 neurons was significantly increased compared
to controls, whereas it was similar to controls with daytime sleep
deprivation (Figures S4A–S4D). These data suggest that the
increased CaLexA signal is induced by increased sleep drive
and not by mechanical stimulation alone. It is well described
that very young animals in multiple species exhibit increased
sleep amount and depth, compared to adults (Frank and Heller,
1997; Roffwarg et al., 1966). In Drosophila, a recent study
demonstrated that young flies have significantly increased sleep
drive compared to older animals (Kayser et al., 2014). Consistent
with this notion, we found that the CaLexA signal in R2 neurons
was dramatically higher in very young animals compared to older
animals (Figures 5E–5H). Together, these imaging data reveal
that Ca2+ levels in R2 neurons are increased under conditions
associated with markedly increased sleep drive: following sleep
deprivation or in very young animals.
We next examined whether Ca2+ levels in these R2 neurons
varied naturally with sleep pressure, in the absence of sleep
deprivation. We used the genetically encoded Ca2+ reporter
UAS-myrGCaMP5G (Melom and Littleton, 2013) to monitor
real-time Ca2+ levels in the R2 ring structure. Ca2+ levels were
measured at ZT0 (low sleep drive), ZT12 (moderate sleep drive),
ZT24 (low sleep drive), and ZT24 following 12 hr of sleep depri-
vation (high sleep drive) (Figure 5I). We found that basal Ca2+
levels in the R2 ring were higher in the early night (ZT12)
compared to the morning (ZT0 and ZT24) (Figures 5J and 5K).
This difference was attributable to changes in sleep drive and
not circadian time, because Ca2+ levels in the R2 ring were
further increased at ZT24 after 12 hr of sleep deprivation during
the night (Figures 5J and 5K). A similar increase in GCaMP signal
was found using an independent thermogenetic method for
inducing sleep deprivation or using an independent GCaMP
line, indicating that this effect is not dependent on mechanical
shaking or a specific GCaMP (Figures S4E–S4H). In contrast,
this increase was not observed in neuronal structures nearby
to the R2 ring (i.e., R3 and R4m rings), indicating it does not occur
broadly in all ellipsoid body rings (Figure S4I). Thus, our data indi-
cate that Ca2+ levels in the R2 neurons correlate with varying
levels of sleep drive in a scalable manner, consistent with a po-
tential role for neural plastic changes in this circuit mediating
sleep homeostasis.
Manipulation of Intracellular Ca2+ Levels Adjusts
Synaptic Strength in R2 Neurons and Alters Sleep Drive
We hypothesized that these variations in intracellular Ca2+ levels
are functionally important for the sleep-need-dependent struc-
tural plasticity seen in R2 neurons. If so, altering intracellular
Ca2+ levels in these neurons would provide a means for testing
whether manipulating neural plasticity impacts sleep homeosta-
sis. Previous work has shown that reduction of Inositol-triphos-
phate receptor (IP3R) activity impairs elevation of cytosolic
Ca2+ levels and Ca2+-dependent plasticity (Berridge, 1998).
Therefore, we drove expression of two different UAS-IP3R-
RNAi transgenes (Murmu et al., 2010) in the R2 neurons and
examined the effects on intracellular Ca2+ levels and structural
plasticity. We first confirmed that both RNAi transgenes were
effective in reducing IP3R transcript (Figure S5A). Knockdown
of IP3R in R2 neurons using either RNAi transgene largely sup-
pressed the increased intracellular Ca2+ seen in these cells
following sleep deprivation (Figure 6A), in contrast to an unre-
lated control RNAi line (Figure S5C). As shown in Figure 6B,
blocking the rise of intracellular Ca2+ levels in R2 neurons with
either IP3R-RNAi line significantly impaired the increases in
number and size of BRP puncta seen in these neurons following
sleep deprivation. To address the effects of these manipulations
on sleep homeostasis, we drove expression of the two IP3R-
RNAi transgenes in the R2 cells and measured sleep rebound
in animals following sleep deprivation. Importantly, knockdown
of IP3R in R2 neurons using either RNAi transgene caused a sig-
nificant reduction in recovery sleep compared to controls (Fig-
ure 6C). Furthermore, knockdown of IP3R in R2 neurons using
either IP3R-RNAi line did not affect baseline sleep, indicating
a specific effect on sleep homeostasis (Figure S5B). Given that
some rebound sleep persists in the absence of increases in
cytosolic Ca2+ and BRP in R2 neurons (Figures 6A–6C), there
may be additional mechanisms encoding homeostatic sleep
drive. Together, these data suggest that Ca2+-dependent plastic
changes in R2 neurons are specifically required for proper ho-
meostatic regulation of sleep.

 In order to conditionally increase intracellular Ca2+ levels
within the R2 circuit, we elevated the temperature from ZT0-
ZT1 (instead of activating dTrpA1 from ZT12-ZT24 as done
previously) for animals expressing dTrpA1 in the R2 neurons.
Remarkably, this protocol led to an increase in number and
size of BRP puncta in these cells, similar to that seen following
sleep deprivation (Figure 6D), suggesting an increase in synaptic
strength. Moreover, as little as 30-min activation of dTrpA1 in the
R2 circuit induced a significant increase in sleep mimicking
‘‘rebound sleep’’ following the temperature elevation, despite
the animals being fully rested (Figures 6E, 6F, and S5D). Thus,
these data suggest that Ca2+-dependent changes in synaptic
strength of the R2 circuit are not only necessary, but also suffi-
cient for encoding sleep drive.
NMDA Receptor Signaling in R2 Neurons Is Required for
Encoding Homeostatic Sleep Drive
Although Ca2+ signaling is crucial for neural plasticity, it is also
involved in diverse cellular signaling pathways (Clapham,
2007). Thus, to further identify and test additional mechanisms
underlying
plasticity-dependent
generation
of
homeostatic
sleep drive, we performed cell-specific translational profiling

 experiments in the R2 neurons. Because the utility of this tech-
nique greatly depends on using an exquisitely specific driver,
we used the split-Gal4 system (Luan et al., 2006) to generate a
driver almost exclusively containing the 16 R2 neurons (Fig-
ure 7A). As expected, activation of this R2-Split-Gal4 driver leads
to a persistent increase in sleep following cessation of the stim-
ulus, as seen with other R2 Gal4 drivers (Figures S6A–S6D).
We used this R2-Split-Gal4 driver to express the EGFP-L10a
fusion protein in the R2 circuit and performed Translating Ribo-
some Affinity Purification (TRAP) experiments (Huang et al.,
2013) to isolate actively translating transcripts from these 16
neurons. As expected, RT-PCR demonstrated marked enrich-
ment of GFP transcript in the R2 TRAP samples, whereas
mRNA of the glial-specific marker repo was essentially undetect-
able in the same samples (Figure 7B). We extracted R2 neuron-
specific mRNA from sleep-deprived and rested control flies and
examined the levels of plasticity-related transcripts in R2 cells
using qPCR. Interestingly, levels of a NMDA receptor subunit
(dNR1) were markedly (�7-fold) and specifically increased in
the R2 neurons, but not broadly in all neurons (Figure 7C).
NMDA receptors in flies consist of two subunits: dNR1 and
dNR2 (Xia et al., 2005). To confirm an associated increase in
NMDA receptor protein levels, we performed immunostaining
experiments using anti-dNR2 antisera, which revealed a signifi-
cant increase in dNR2 levels in R2 neurons following sleep depri-
vation (Figures S6E and S6F). To address whether NMDA recep-
tors are required for the structural plasticity in R2 neurons
induced by sleep loss, we performed RNAi knockdown experi-
ments using two different RNAi lines targeting dNR1 or dNR2
(Wu et al., 2007) and then examined BRP puncta using the
STaR system. We first confirmed that these RNAi lines were
effective at reducing dNR1 and dNR2 levels, respectively (Fig-
ures S6G and S6H). Next, we found that knockdown of either
dNR1 or dNR2 in R2 neurons significantly suppressed the
sleep-deprivation-induced increase in the number and size of
BRP puncta in these cells, indicating that NMDA receptors are
required in R2 neurons for ‘‘sleep-need’’-dependent plasticity
(Figure 7D). Importantly, knockdown of either dNR1 or dNR2 in
the R2 circuit significantly reduced rebound sleep after sleep
deprivation (Figure 7E) but did not affect baseline sleep (Fig-
ure S6I), suggesting that NMDA receptor (NMDAR)-dependent
plasticity is specifically required in these neurons for generating
homeostatic sleep drive. Thus, these data identify a key molec-
ular mechanism mediating neural plastic changes in R2 neurons
and demonstrate that this plasticity is required for homeostatic
regulation of sleep.
DISCUSSION
As mentioned previously, homeostatic systems are predicted
to consist of ‘‘sensor,’’ ‘‘integrator,’’ and ‘‘effector’’ circuits. Acti-
vation of sleep homeostatic ‘‘effector’’ circuits (such as VLPO/
MnPO in mammals (Saito et al., 2013) or ExFl2 neurons in flies
(Donlea et al., 2014) directly induces sleep, whose persistence
depends upon continued stimulation of the circuit (see also Fig-
ure 1B). In contrast, even 30-min activation of the R2 circuit in
non-sleep-deprived animals leads to a prolonged increase in
sleep amount and depth following cessation of the stimulus.
This phenotype indicates that activation of these neurons
generates sleep drive even in fully rested animals. This unusual
phenotype, coupled with our findings that these R2 neurons
act upstream of the ‘‘effector’’ ExFl2 neurons and undergo
‘‘sleep-need’’-dependent plastic changes, suggests that the
R2 circuit acts as a key ‘‘integrator’’ for sleep homeostasis.
Sleep homeostasis is thought to operate not only under condi-
tions that provoke strong sleep drive (i.e., sleep deprivation), but
also at baseline when sleep pressure gradually accumulates to-
ward the end of the waking period (Borbe
´ ly, 1982). Interestingly,
although our data suggest that the R2 neurons can sense
changes in sleep drive under baseline conditions (Figures 3B,
3D, 3F, and 5I–5K), they are not essential for sleep amount in
this situation (Figures 2A and S2A–S2C). Thus, while the R2 neu-
rons play a crucial role in the homeostatic regulation of sleep
following sleep deprivation, additional mechanisms likely play a
role under baseline conditions.
Our data argue that plastic changes within the R2 neural circuit
generate sleep drive (Figure 7F). In this model, prolonged wake-
fulness leads to a sustained increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels in
Figure 7. NMDA Receptor Expression in the R2 Circuit Is Required for Sleep-Need-Dependent Plasticity and Generation of Homeostatic

(F) Proposed model illustrating the encoding of sleep drive in R2 neurons. Following hours of sleep deprivation, R2 neurons exhibit an IP3R-dependent increase in
cytosolic Ca2+ levels and a marked increase in NMDA receptor levels. These changes lead to both electrical potentiation of the R2 neurons and increased
synaptic strength of these neurons, as indicated by higher levels of BRP. Sleep drive is encoded by the persistently increased synaptic strength of the R2 circuit
and is maintained for hours following restoration of sleep.

 R2 neurons, which then results in greater synaptic strength as re-
flected by an increased number and size of active zones, and
greater excitability of these neurons, as reflected by their switch
to burst-firing. Thus, both synaptic and non-synaptic plasticity
are induced in R2 neurons by sleep loss, which act together to
markedly potentiate the activity of these cells. NMDA receptors,
well known for their role in synaptic plasticity (Malenka and Nic-
oll, 1993), are also upregulated in R2 neurons with sleep loss to
further potentiate synaptic strength, either in concert or in paral-
lel with the increases in intracellular Ca2+. As suggested by our
data (Figures S6E and S6F), NMDA receptors are shown presyn-
aptically, which would imply strengthening of the connection be-
tween the R2 neuron and its downstream partner. However, it is
also possible that NMDARs act postsynaptically. In either case,
sleep drive would be encoded by the degree of potentiation of
the R2 circuit, which would then promote sleep via persistent
activation of sleep ‘‘effector’’ neurons such as the ExFl2 cells
in flies.
Our findings support an alternative model to the traditional
‘‘somnogen model’’ of sleep homeostasis. Rather than global
sleep drive being encoded by varying levels of extracellular sub-
stances in the brain, we propose that it is encoded by Ca2+- and
NMDA-receptor-dependent plastic changes in a dedicated neu-
ral circuit. Moreover, unlike the case for ‘‘somnogens’’ or SRSs
whose half-lives are on the order of minutes, our model provides
a mechanistic explanation for the persistence of sleep drive
lasting for hours following the initiation of recovery sleep.
Although their brain structures are different, core circuit princi-
ples are often shared between flies and mammals (Borst and
Helmstaedter, 2015; Strausfeld and Hirth, 2013). Thus, a sleep
homeostatic integrator circuit, whose plastic changes encode
sleep drive, may exist in mammals.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Sleep Assays
Sleep analysis was performed as previously described (Liu et al., 2014). For
sleep deprivation experiments, flies were mechanically stimulated for 5 s per
min for 12 or 24 hr using a vortexer mounting plate and multi-tube vortexer (Tri-
kinetics). Only data from flies with a R95% reduction in sleep amount during
deprivation, compared with baseline conditions, were analyzed. ‘‘% Recov-
ered sleep’’ was calculated as the difference in sleep amount between the
deprived and undisturbed control animals during the first 6 hr following depri-
vation, divided by the amount of sleep lost during sleep deprivation.
BRP and CaLexA Measurements
For BRP and CaLexA measurements, fly brains were whole-mount immuno-
stained with anti-V5 or anti-GFP, respectively. Images were taken under
633 magnification, acquired at 1,024 3 1,024 pixels, and further analyzed in
Fiji/ImageJ. To measure signal intensities, the sum of all pixels of a stack
comprising the R2 ring or other regions of interest (ROIs) was calculated. Back-
ground intensity adjacent to the ROI was measured and subtracted. For anal-
ysis of BRP puncta, stacks only containing R2 ring signal were extracted from
the original image stacks, and number and size of BRP puncta were automat-
ically calculated using the ‘‘3D Objects Counter’’ Plugin. The threshold for
calculating the BRP puncta was manually determined for each stack of im-
ages, for which the largest number of BRP puncta was identified by the plugin.
For CaLexA sleep deprivation experiments, 7- to 9-day old flies were used. To
minimize effects from environmental stimulation, flies were transferred to con-
stant darkness (DD) for 1 day prior to sleep deprivation, which was performed
as described above for 12 or 24 hr in DD.
Intracellular Ca2+ Measurements
For intracellular Ca2+ level measurements, 7- to 9-day-old R69F08-Gal4 >
UAS-myrGCaMP5, UAS-CD4-tdTomato or R69F08-Gal4 > UAS-GCaMP6s,
UAS-CD4-tdTomato flies were examined. GCaMP signal in the R2 ring neuro-
pil was measured immediately (within 5 min) after dissection at different time
points (ZT0 and ZT12), or following sleep deprivation. All brains were quickly
dissected in adult hemolymph-like saline (AHLS) and imaged using a
LSM700 confocal microscope. The R2 ring structure was located in less
than 15 s by fast pre-scanning of tdTomato signal (543 nm). A single optical
section was selected that contained the maximum area and intensity of
tdTomato signal under a 633 water-immersion objective lens. GCaMP signals
were recorded at 2 frames per second (fps) for 1 min. Average projections of all
the frames in the 1-min recording were used to calculate the baseline GCaMP
signal. ROIs of the R2 ring were outlined by using the tdTomato signal. Fluores-
cent signal from both GCaMP and tdTomato in the same ROI were each
summed and normalized to the background in Fiji/ImageJ. GCaMP signal
was divided by the tdTomato signal for the same ROI to correct for be-
tween-specimen variation.

Experimental Procedures.
