Introduction
In 1992, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 
recommended back sleeping for infants as a measure 
to reduce the incidence of sudden infant death syn-
drome (SIDS) in the United States.1 In 2003, the 
Chicago Infant Mortality Study reported that a prone 
sleeping position, a soft sleeping surface, and shared 
bed sleeping were major risk factors associated with 
SIDS,2 and in 2011, the AAP expanded its position to 
include recommendations for a safe, infant sleeping 
environment.3 Following an initial decline in SIDS 
deaths after the release of the original AAP recom-
mendations, the incidence of SIDS has plateaued in 
the United States; of concern, an increase in other 
causes of sleep-related deaths, including asphyxia and 
suffocation, has occurred.4
Bed-sharing (when the infant sleeps on the same 
surface as an adult) is both a risk factor for SIDS and a 
major barrier to safe sleep. A recent meta-analysis con-
firmed that bed-sharing was a significant risk factor for 
SIDS (odds ratio [OR] = 2.88; 95% confidence interval 
[CI] = 1.99-4.18). Moreover, bed-sharing may predis-
pose to other SIDS risk factors, including overheating, 
rebreathing, airway obstruction, head covering, and 
exposure to tobacco smoke.5 In spite of the evidence 
incriminating the role of bed-sharing in SIDS, little is 
known about the social and environmental factors that 
are associated with bed-sharing. This study was under-
taken to determine how sleeping environment, in addi-
tion to other social and environmental factors, affect 
bed-sharing in the immediate newborn period.

Abstract
Objective: Bed-sharing is associated with sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation 
in bed. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for newborn bed-sharing. Methods: Postpartum 
mothers from a university maternity service were contacted by phone to complete a survey. Demographic and 
environmental data were collected; newborn bed-sharing and sleep environment were self-reported. Results: A 
total of 1261 mothers completed surveys; bed-sharing was reported by 79 mothers (6.3%). Multivariate logistic 
regression identified referral to a nurse (odds ratio [OR] = 10; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.5-30) and sleep 
location “other” than a crib, bassinet, or Pack and Play (OR = 7.1; 95% CI = 1.9-25.9) as factors associated with an 
increased risk of bed-sharing; formula feeding (OR = 0.4; 95% CI = 0.20-0.77) and crib sleeping (OR = 0.49; 95% CI 
= 0.26-0.86) reduced this risk. Conclusion: Infants with no identifiable places to sleep, significant health issues, and 
who are breastfed are more likely to bed-share. Interventional studies should be directed at these factors.

Methods
Patients and Data Collection
Women who delivered at Temple University Hospital 
between January 1 and October 31, 2015, who were dis-
charged from the hospital with their child, and had a 
phone number listed in the medical record were eligible 
for study. Attempts were made to contact each subject 
within 72 hours of discharge. For those subjects success-
fully contacted by phone, general questions regarding 
the hospital stay as well as need for follow-up appoint-
ments and other health issues were asked. In some 
instances, the maternal responses to questions resulted 
in a referral to a nurse. Maternal age; parity; educational 
level; smoking status; method of infant feeding; enroll-
ment in the state women, infants, and children supple-
mental nutritional program; and whether a referral to a 
nurse was made were recorded. To determine infant and 
parental sleep behaviors, the following questions were 
also included:
1. 
“Are you having any trouble feeding your baby?” 
Yes or no.
2. 
“Where does your baby sleep: crib, bassinet, 
Pack and Play or other?”
3. 
“Does your baby sleep on his/her back, side, 
belly, or all of these?”
4. 
“Do you ever fall asleep with your baby in the 
same bed, couch, or chair?” Yes or no.
5. 
“Has a doctor ever talked to you about sleeping 
with your baby?” Yes or no.
Statistical Analysis
Chi-square analysis was used to compare responses to 
dichotomous and multiclass questions using co-sleep-
ing as the response variable, while t test of estimated 
means was used for continuous variables. A logistic 
linear classifier without regularization was used to 
develop a probit model for co-sleeping. Differences 
in co-sleeping rates for each feature of the model 
were determined by analysis of variance and expressed 
as an odds ratio. Features with P values less than .05 
and with 95% confidence intervals not including 1 
were considered to be statistically significant and 
independent predictors of co-sleeping. All calcula-
tions were performed using the basic package in R 
(version 3.1.0).
Results
This study was reviewed by the institutional review 
board of Temple University.
Demographics
A total of 2421 mothers were called between January 
 
1, 2015, and October 31, 2015; 1506 respondents 
answered the call, and 1261 respondents completed the 
questionnaire. The demographics and responses of the 
study subjects are shown in Table 1. The median mater-
nal age was 25.06 years, and the mean age was 26.00 
years (interquartile range = 21.24-29.85 years). Thirty-
eight percent (479/1261) of the subjects graduated high 
school, and 9% (115/1261) smoked tobacco. Twenty-
four percent of the infants (754/1261) were exclusively 
breastfed during the first week of life, while 39% 
(490/1261) were breastfed and supplemented with 
 Heere et al 
3
formula; 7% of mothers (90/1261) reported a feeding 
problem. Clinical issues requiring input from nursing 
occurred in 60% (754/1261) of the calls. Bed-sharing 
was reported by 6.3% (79/1261) of the subjects, and 15 
subjects (1%) reported an infant sleep location other 
than a bassinet, crib, or Pack and Play.
Univariate Analysis
Head-to-head comparisons of the demographic factors 
and questionnaire responses among those who shared a 
bed with an infant and those who did not are shown in 
Table 2. Referral to a nurse (OR = 10.9; 95% CI = 4.8-
31.3), presence of a feeding problem (OR = 3.5; 95% CI 
= 1.8-6.2), and sleep location “other” than a crib, bassi-
net, or Pack and Play (OR = 8; 95% CI = 2.6-23.3) were 
associated with an increased risk of bed-sharing. 
Formula feeding (OR = 0.28; 95% CI = 0.15-0.52), 
sleeping in a crib (OR = 0.5; 95% CI = 0.28-0.86), and 
education from a doctor regarding infant sleep (OR = 
0.24; 95% CI = 0.11-0.62) were associated with a 
decreased risk of bed-sharing.
Multivariate Analysis
The results of logistic regression analysis using bed-
sharing as the response variable are shown in Table 3. 
Identification of issues requiring referral to a nurse 
(OR = 10; 95% CI = 4.5-30) and sleep location “other” 
than a crib, bassinet, or Pack and Play (OR = 7.1; 95% 
CI = 1.9-25.9) were associated with an increased risk 
of bed-sharing. Exclusive formula feeding (OR = 0.4; 
95% CI = 0.20-0.77) and sleeping in a crib (OR = 0.49; 
95% CI = 0.26-0.86) reduced this risk.
Discussion
Along with sleeping on a soft surface and sleeping in a 
prone position,4 bed-sharing is a significant risk factor 
for SIDS in the United States.5 The present study sug-
gests that lack of an identified place to sleep, breastfeed-
ing, and health issues requiring a nurse referral are risk 
factors for bed-sharing.
In 1992, the AAP recommended that infants should 
sleep in the supine position to reduce the incidence of 
SIDS.1 From 1992 to 2001, the SIDS rate decreased 53% 
(120 deaths per 100 000 live births in 1992 to 56 deaths 
per 100 000 live births in 2001). From 2001 to 2006, the 
rate remained constant. From 2006 to 2014, the rate 
declined to 38.7 deaths per 100 000 live births in 2014.3
While the SIDS rate has declined, the rate of deaths 
attributed to accidental suffocation and strangulation in 
bed (ASSB) has been increasing. ASSB is the code 
applied to a death when the terms “asphyxia,” “asphyxi-
ated,” “asphyxiation,” “strangled,” “strangulated,” “stran-
gulation,” “suffocated,” or “suffocation” are reported,

along with the terms “bed” or “crib,” and also includes 
deaths while sleeping on chairs and couches.4 One 
descriptive study examined the infant mortality data from 
1984 through 2004, and analyzed trends in ASSB and 
other sudden unexpected infant deaths.6 Infant mortality 
rates attributable to ASSB quadrupled: from 2.8 deaths 
(1984) to 12.5 deaths (2004) per 100 000 live births. In 
2014, the rate of deaths from ASSB was 21.4 deaths per 
100 000 live births.3
In 2003, the Chicago Infant Mortality Study reported 
an increased risk of SIDS associated with bed-sharing 
with parent(s) alone (OR = 1.9; 95% CI = 1.2-3.1) bed-
sharing in other combinations (OR = 5.4; 95% CI = 2.8-
10.2), prone sleeping (OR = 2.4; 95% CI = 1.7-3.4), and 
sleeping on a soft surface (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 3.1-8.3).2 
The most recent recommendations from the AAP for 
safe infant sleep include supine positioning, use of a 
firm sleep surface, breastfeeding, room-sharing without 
bed-sharing, routine immunization, consideration of a 
pacifier, and avoidance of soft bedding, overheating, 
and exposure to tobacco smoke, alcohol, and illicit drugs 
as measures to decrease the risk of SUID.7 The data 
from this study support these recommendations. The 
greatest risk for bed-sharing in our patient population 
occurred among those infants with no identifiable place 
to sleep or with significant health or care issues.
One limitation of this study is the low number of 
respondents. Of the 2421 mothers called, 1506 (62 %) 
answered the call, and 1261 (52%) completed the phone 
survey. Another limitation is the process of a self-
reported phone survey, in which the actual behaviors 
may not be reported.
Conclusion
In summary, the risk of infant bed-sharing is increased 
among infants with no identifiable place to sleep, who 
have significant health or care issues, and who are 
breastfed. Comprehensive educational, postpartum, pro-
grams should address the risk factors associated with 
infant deaths that occur during sleep. This education 
should include specific support of breastfeeding without 
bed-sharing as well as the need for identifiable, safe 
places for the infant to sleep.
