BACKGROUND: The potential impact of microwave radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) emitted by wireless communication devices on
neurocognitive functions of adolescents is controversial. In a previous analysis, we found changes in figural memory scores associated with a higher
cumulative RF-EMF brain dose in adolescents.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to follow-up our previous results using a new study population, dose estimation, and approach to controlling for confounding
from media usage itself.
METHODS: RF-EMF brain dose for each participant was modeled. Multivariable linear regression models were fitted on verbal and figural memory
score changes over 1 y and on estimated cumulative brain dose and RF-EMF related and unrelated media usage (n = 669–676). Because of the hemi-
spheric lateralization of memory, we conducted a laterality analysis for phone call ear preference. To control for the confounding of media use behav-
iors, a stratified analysis for different media usage groups was also conducted.
RESULTS: We found decreased figural memory scores in association with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in estimated cumulative RF-EMF brain
dose scores: −0:22 (95% CI: −0:47, 0.03; IQR: 953 mJ=kg per day) in the whole sample, −0:39 (95% CI: −0:67, −0:10; IQR: 953 mJ=kg per day) in
right-side users (n = 532), and −0:26 (95% CI: −0:42, −0:10; IQR: 341 mJ=kg per day) when recorded network operator data were used for RF-EMF
dose estimation (n = 274). Media usage unrelated to RF-EMF did not show significant associations or consistent patterns, with the exception of con-
sistent (nonsignificant) positive associations between data traffic duration and verbal memory.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings for a cohort of Swiss adolescents require confirmation in other populations but suggest a potential adverse effect of RF-
EMF brain dose on cognitive functions that involve brain regions mostly exposed during mobile phone use. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP2427
Introduction
The rapid evolution of information and communication technolo-
gies (ICTs) during the past 20 y has caused an increase in man-
made exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-
EMFs). However, the health effects of RF-EMFs are still unknown.
Neurological functions are of special concern given that the brain
is heavily exposed while calling with a mobile or cordless phone
(Joseph et al. 2010). Present-day adolescents will likely have
higher cumulative lifetime exposure to RF-EMF, and the develop-
ing brain might be particularly susceptible to RF-EMF–induced
alterations up to 15 y of age (Kheifets et al. 2005; Luciana et al.
2005; Schüz 2005). In this age group, memory functions are particu-
larly important because proper encoding, processing, and retrieval
of information are required for learning. However, to date studies
addressing this topic have produced inconsistent results.
Controlled-exposure studies in animals and humans have found
limited evidence for both positive and negative effects of RF-EMF
on memory performance and related neural processes (Bouji et al.
2012; Deshmukh et al. 2015; Hao et al. 2013; Jeong et al. 2015;
Klose et al. 2014; Son et al. 2016). Among the few epidemio-logical
studies, the Australian Mobile Radiofrequency Phone Exposed
Users’ Study (MoRPhEUS) cohort of 317 adolescents with a me-
dian age of 13 y observed faster but less accurate responses in work-
ing memory and associative learning tasks for frequent mobile
phone users (Abramson et al. 2009). The same result was observed
in relation to the number of text messages (SMS), which involve
only marginal RF-EMF exposure. This may suggest that aspects
other than RF-EMFs are the underlying cause of this association. A
longitudinal analysis of the MoRPhEUS data indicated associations
between mobile phone use and changes in response times for some
cognitive tasks over a 1-y period, but the authors proposed regres-
sion to the mean as a potential explanation because associations
were inconsistent and increase in exposure was mainly seen in those
who had fewer calls and SMS at baseline (Thomas et al. 2010).
In the following Examination of Psychological Outcomes in
Students using Radiofrequency dEvices (ExPOSURE) study by the
same research group as MoRPhEUS, 617 primary school children
were investigated and little evidence for cognitive effects due to RF-
EMF was found (Redmayne et al. 2013). However, the number of
calls was generally very low in these young children (8–11 y of age):
a median of 2.5 and 2 calls per week for mobile phones and cordless
phones, respectively, among those children using these devices.
In both studies, the RF-EMF exposure was assessed via self-
reported number of calls, which usually yields an overestimation
of the actual use by adolescents (Aydin et al. 2011). Further, perso-
nal exposure to RF-EMF is dependent on other factors such as the
call duration, the distance of the device from the body (Joseph et al.
2010; Kühn and Kuster 2013), and the network used for calling. For
instance, the global system for mobile communications standard
(GSM) produces about 100–500 times higher exposure than the uni-
versal mobile telecommunication system (UMTS) (Gati et al. 2009;
Persson et al. 2012). Furthermore, using mobile phone calls as a
proxy for RF-EMF exposure ignores confounding by the media-
related lifestyle impacting individuals’ cognition, behavior, and
emotion (Kuss et al. 2014; Kuss and Griffiths 2011, 2012; Roser
et al. 2016). The present Health Effects Related to Mobile phone
usE in adolescentS (HERMES) cohort was the first study in

Research
 adolescents that used individually modeled RF-EMF doses and
operator-recorded mobile phone use to investigate potential effects
of RF-EMF exposure on cognitive functions (Roser et al. 2015).
With this approach, cumulative RF-EMF brain dose was associated
with a significant decrease in figural memory performance over a
1-y period (Schoeni et al. 2015), with a stronger decrease observed
in right-side users.
The present study aims to follow-up our previous results
using an approximate doubling of sample size. Further, we have
updated the individual RF-EMF dose model using more recent in-
formation on adolescents’ brain specific absorption rates (SARs)
for different exposure scenarios and by calibrating self-reported
call duration on objective operator-recorded call duration. In addi-
tion, the present study applies a new approach to control for con-
founding due to device usage in epidemiological RF-EMF studies.
Materials and Methods
Data of the prospective HERMES cohort study were collected in
two independent sampling waves. The first wave of baseline investi-
gations commenced in June 2012 among a cohort of seventh-
through ninth-grade students from 24 secondary schools in Central
Switzerland. A second wave commenced in April 2014 that
included a new group of seventh- through ninth-grade students from
22 secondary schools. Of the 22 schools, 2 had already taken part in
the first wave, 18 were newly recruited from Central Switzerland,
and 2 were newly recruited from the Basel canton. Follow-up inves-
tigations were conducted approximately 1 y after each baseline until
April 2016. Participating adolescents were recruited through an ini-
tial telephone contact by the head of the school and a subsequent
informational visit in their respective classes by the study managers.
Participation was voluntary and the informed consent of both ado-
lescents and a parent was compulsory.
The data were collected during school lessons and consisted
of completing a paper questionnaire to assess the adolescents’
mobile phone and media usage as well as their psychological and
somatic health and socioeconomic factors. Computerized cogni-
tive testing was performed immediately afterward. Additionally, a
subsample of 148 volunteers from both study waves was recruited
to conduct personal RF-EMF measurements as described in detail
for the first study wave (n = 90) by Roser et al. (2017). These par-
ticipants were intentionally sampled depending on their place of
residence and school in order to be representative of the entire far-
field exposure range of the complete study sample. Participants
were required to carry a portable measurement device (exposime-
ter) with an integrated Global Positioning System (GPS) for 3 con-
secutive days. Simultaneously, a time–activity app on a smartphone
in flight mode had to be filled in to later link the RF-EMF records
to a particular activity or place.
Ethical approval for conducting the study was received from
the ethical committee of the canton of Lucerne, Switzerland, on 9
May 2012 (EKLU 12025 and EKBB 80/12).
Outcome Assessment: Memory Performance
Cognitive performance was measured using a standardized com-
puterized testing system consisting of the figural and verbal
memory subtest of the Intelligenz-Struktur-Test (IST) (Liepmann
et al. 2007). For the verbal memory task, participants were given
1 min to memorize five sets of two to five words grouped by their
common higher semantic category (e.g., city: Amsterdam, Rome,
Hamburg, Madrid, York). The target words were presented by
starting with a different letter each time. Immediately after the pre-
senting phase, participants were given a letter and they had to recall
the word starting with that letter and report the higher semantic cat-
egory to which it belonged. This was repeated for 11 words,
producing a maximum score of 11 points for the verbal memory task.
For the figural memory task, participants were given 1 min to memo-
rize 13 pairs of abstract figures, and immediately afterward one item
per pair was shown and participants were asked to choose the correct
counterpart out of five possible options. The matching task was
repeated for 13 symbols, resulting in a maximum score of 13 points.
For each of the two tests, 2 min were given to complete the matching
task. Each student started with the verbal memory task.
For the statistical analyses, the difference between the continu-
ous test score values at follow-up minus the baseline values were
used as outcome. The coefficient of the outcome–exposure associa-
tion corresponds directly to the change in score: A positive coeffi-
cient thus indicates an improvement in memory between baseline
and follow-up in relation to the exposure of interest, whereas a nega-
tive association indicates a decrease in memory. In the age group of
our study, without considering any exposure, one would generally
expect an increase in verbal memory and an increase or little change
in figural memory between baseline and follow-up. However, mem-
ory development during adolescence may vary largely interindi-
vidually (Luciana et al. 2005; Schneider and Pressley 2013).
Exposure: Mobile Phone and General Media Use
The detailed usage of mobile phones and other wireless commu-
nication devices was assessed via questionnaire. Questions
focused on the average amount and type of mobile phone and
media usage per day. Exposures of primary interest were those
expected to produce relatively high RF-EMF exposure: specifi-
cally, the daily duration and number of calls on mobile and cord-
less phones. In addition, we asked whether students preferentially
held mobile phones on the right or left side of their heads when
making calls or whether they had no preference. Further, partici-
pants were asked about headset use while calling, which is an im-
portant factor for RF exposure because exposure to the body
decreases rapidly with increasing distance from the device (Lauer
et al. 2013). We also asked about activities that might be corre-
lated with phone use but that would be expected to result in rela-
tively low RF-EMF exposures, including the number of text
messages sent per day, daily duration of data traffic on the stu-
dent’s mobile phone, daily duration of gaming on electronic
devices, the frequency of social network use, and whether the
student’s mobile phone was left on or turned off at night. In
addition, we used the brief MPPUS-10 scale to assess problem-
atic mobile phone use in the students (Foerster et al. 2015).
For the self-reported usage measures included in the linear
regression analysis (daily frequency of text messages, daily dura-
tion of mobile phone data traffic, daily duration of gaming, and
daily duration of cordless phone use), we calculated the cumula-
tive usage by taking the mean difference between baseline and
follow-up, and interpreting this value as usage per day.
Detailed data records of daily quantitative mobile phone use
from the 6 months preceding the baseline examination date until the
follow-up investigations were obtained from the Swiss mobile
phone network operators [Swisscom, Sunrise, and Salt (formerly
known as Orange)] if adolescents and one of their parents had given
additional written informed consent. These participants are subse-
quently referred to herein as the operator sample. The operator
records included the number and duration of calls, number of text
messages sent per day, and the daily volume of data traffic. In addi-
tion, the identity of the network (UMTS or GSM) used to start each
phone call was obtained from the operators Swisscom and Salt,
whereas the third operator, Sunrise, did not provide this information.
The daily cumulative mobile phone call duration was calculated
by summing up all recorded call durations between baseline and
follow-up and dividing this sum by the recorded days between base-
line and follow-up to obtain daily usage.

 A comparison of self-reported mobile phone use with operator-
recorded use indicated severe overestimation of self-reported mobile
phone use. To avoid bias, we calibrated self-reported mobile phone
call duration for participants without operator records. The calibra-
tion equation was derived from the operator sample using a multile-
vel linear regression model that was clustered by schools with
average operator-recorded mobile phone call duration per day as de-
pendent variable and the following predictors to be found relevant
(likelihood ratio test for the nonclustered model including or exclud-
ing the predictor): age, gender, daily frequency of mobile phone
calls at follow-up, daily frequency of text messages at follow-up,
daily duration of mobile phone data traffic at follow-up, and daily
duration of cordless phone calls at follow-up as well as the differ-
ence in daily duration of mobile phone calls between follow-up and
baseline (see Table S1). Subsequently, the predicted values from the
calibration model were used as estimated daily call duration for the
participants without operator data. A similar model was constructed
to predict the proportion of calls made on the UMTS network, with
the following predictors to be found relevant: the place of residence
(urban vs. rural—the UMTS proportion was usually lower in rural
areas), UMTS exposure (as a proportion of total downlink) at place
of residence obtained by geospatial propagation model (see below),
and the number of smartphones at the home as well as the duration
of mobile data traffic—all of which were indicators of a higher
UMTS proportion. The proportion of GSM network was assumed
to be 1 – proportionðUMTSÞ. The distinction between both net-
works used was important in determining RF-EMF exposure
because, compared with calls executed on the UMTS network, calls
on the GSM network have been associated with irradiation levels
heightened by a factor of 100–500 (Gati et al. 2009; Persson et al.
2012). For the participants for whom operator-recorded data was
available, the objectively recorded data (cumulative call duration
and, if applicable, network proportion) was used for all further anal-
ysis, including the RF-dose estimation.
Individual Cumulative RF-EMF Brain Dose
Individual RF-EMF brain dose was calculated using an updated
dosimetric model described in detail by Roser et al. (2015) that
considers RF-EMF exposure-relevant behaviors and circumstan-
ces from near- and far-field sources. Near field refers to the use
of RF-EMF–emitting devices close to the body (e.g., mobile
phones, wireless Internet), whereas far field refers to the sur-
rounding environmental RF-EMF exposure (e.g., from fixed-site
transmitters, W-LAN access points, people using mobile phones
nearby).
The first step in dose modeling consists of simulating SARs
of the brain gray matter for each exposure-relevant behavior and
circumstance [for details see “1. Numeric simulations of brain
gray matter specific absorption rates (SAR)” in the Supplemental
Material]. SAR is a quantity that indicates the rate at which RF-
EMF is absorbed in a certain mass or volume of tissue. SAR val-
ues are determined using numeric simulations based on two adoles-
cent human body models from the phantom “virtual population,”
an 11-y-old girl (Billie) and a 14-y-old boy (Louis) (Gosselin et al.
2014). For near-field sources, SARs were simulated for three sce-
narios (positions of the emitting device with relation to the body):
(a) device held close to the ear, (b) device kept in the pocket of
trousers, and (c) device held at a distance of 20 cm to the ear (head-
set scenario).
SAR values were transformed to dose values by multiplying
the SAR with relevant exposure durations (see Table S1). The
following near-field exposures were considered in the model:
daily duration of mobile phone use (separated by 2G/3G and
headset use); daily duration of mobile phone data traffic (sepa-
rated by transfer via WiFi and mobile phone network); daily
duration of cordless phone calls (considering the phone’s eco
mode if applicable); daily duration of WiFi use on laptop, PC,
and tablet; and daily duration of carrying the participant’s own
mobile phone close to body (e.g., in a pocket). The average out-
put power of these devices was derived from the literature [for
details see “1. Numeric simulations of brain gray matter specific
absorption rates (SAR)” in the Supplemental Material].
The far-field dose modeling included exposure from mobile
phone base stations (downlink) broadcasting (radio and TV), WiFi,
DECT (Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications base sta-
tions at the home), and far-field exposure from the mobile phones of
other nearby people (uplink). Downlink and broadcasting exposure
at home and at school was modeled for each participant by means of
the geospatial NISMap software (Bürgi et al. 2010).The model is
based on accurate operation parameters of all stationary mobile
phone and broadcast transmitters and the three-dimensional build-
ing and topography model of the study area. Semi-empirical propa-
gation algorithms such as COST-Walfisch-Ikegami (Cichon and
Kürner 1999) were used to predict RF-EMF exposure at the receptor
points, taking into account, for example, the shielding effects of
buildings and topography. Duration of exposure at school was
assumed to be 35 h per week in order to eventually obtain the aver-
age downlink and broadcasting exposure.
WiFi, uplink, and DECT cannot be modeled by NISMap. Thus,
for WiFi and uplink factors, predicting exposure to these sources
were identified by linear regression from personal measurement
data available from 148 study participants (see Table S1). Relevant
predictors for 24-h personal WiFi exposure were the mobile phone
operator, presence of WiFi at school, the daily duration of mobile
data traffic, and the study wave (2012–2014 vs. 2014–2016).
Predictors of uplink were the mobile phone operator, mobile phone
status at night (on vs. off), the number of smartphones at the home,
the time spent in public transport (train and bus), and the study
wave. Because no valuable predictors for DECT could be identi-
fied, it was assumed to be the mean DECT exposure as derived
from personal measurements in 148 participants. These 24-h far-
field exposure values were then transformed to SAR values of the
brain gray matter using plane-wave-simulations in the Finite-
Different Time-Domain-based simulation software SEMCAD-X,
version 16 from SPEAG, Zürich, Switzerland (see Table S2). In a
final step, the individual RF-EMF brain gray matter dose for each
participant was calculated by summing up the contributions of all
different near- and far-field exposure scenarios.
Statistical Analysis
All analyses were conducted for the complete sample as well as
separately for the two subsamples investigated during 2012–2014
and 2014–2016, respectively. Following the protocol used in our
previous analysis, three different types of exposure variable
were considered: (a) cumulative RF-EMF brain dose, (b) cumu-
lative wireless device use related to RF-EMF exposure (cord-
less phone calls and mobile phone calls), and (c) cumulative
wireless device use not or only marginally related to RF-EMF ex-
posure (duration of data traffic, duration of gaming, number of text
messages sent). Outcome variables were changes in figural and
verbal memory score (follow-up minus baseline) over 1 y.
Separate linear exposure–response models were used to esti-
mate associations between each outcome (the change in verbal or
figural memory scores from baseline to follow-up, respectively)
and each primary exposure variable (modeled as a continuous
variable). All models were adjusted for age, gender, nationality
(Swiss, Swiss and other, other), school level [in ascending order
according to the school system in Switzerland based on academic
expectations: secondary school level C, secondary school level
B, secondary school level A, college preparatory high school],

 frequency of physical activity at follow-up (defined as working
out for at least 40 min: ≤1 to 3 times per month, 1 time per week,
2–3 times per week, 4–6 times per week, daily), days of alcohol
consumption per month at follow-up (none, ≤1 time per month,
2–4 times per month, 2–3 times per week), change in height
between baseline and follow-up (as a proxy for developmental
speed between both time points), duration between baseline and
follow-up in months, and education of parents (training school,
college preparatory high school, college or higher education,
university).
In the second step, a laterality analysis of RF-EMF brain dose
(head laterality was not considered in the RF-EMF dose model)
was conducted given that the figural memory involves mainly the
right hemisphere, whereas verbal memory processing is more left
sided (Golby et al. 2001; Nagel et al. 2013). Because most of the
study participants indicated they held their phone on the right side
of their head, we dichotomized the participants into right-side users
vs. left-side users and users with no preference (combined).
Laterality analyses were performed using data for the entire sample
and were repeated after restriction to the operator sample. To facili-
tate comparisons among the different exposure variables, all effect
estimates are expressed as the difference in test scores associated
with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in exposure.
Missing values in the confounder variables were either
imputed via linear regression (17 missing values at follow-up for
alcohol consumption were predicted by age, gender, school class,
and school level; 14 missing values at baseline and 12 missing
values at follow-up for information on height were predicted by
weight, age, and gender) or by imputation, replacing the missing
values with the most common category (i.e., 2 missing values at
follow-up for frequency of physical activity were replaced by the
most common category “2–3 times per week”, and 167 missing
values for educational level of the parents were replaced by the
most common category “Training school”). Statistical analyses
were carried out using STATA (version 14; StataCorp).
To evaluate residual confounding from unmeasured factors
related to communication device use, we performed stratified anal-
yses across five subgroups representing five different media usage
profiles derived by means of latent class analysis of 11 media use
variables from the baseline questionnaire data (Foerster and Röösli
2017). The following five classes were identified: Low Use,
Medium Use, Call Preference, Gaming, and High Social Use (see
Figure S1).
We performed separate linear regression models restricted to
students in each of the five media usage groups and estimated dif-
ferences in each outcome with an IQR increase (defined for the
population as a whole) in cumulative RF-EMF brain dose. Next,
we performed random effects meta-analyses to derive a summary
estimate for each outcome in each subgroup and assessed hetero-
geneity using the I2 statistic (Higgins et al. 2003). We assumed
that physical effects of RF-EMF would have a similar impact
across media use subgroups, independent of any psychological or
cognitive effects of media use; therefore, evidence of heterogene-
ity among the five group-specific estimates would be consistent
with uncontrolled psychobehavioral confounding.
Results
In total, 895 adolescents between 12 and 17 y of age were enrolled
in the baseline investigation of the HERMES study. The first sam-
pling wave included 439 [mean age ± standard deviation ðSDÞ:
14:0 ± 0:85)] students recruited from 57 classes in 24 schools.
During the second wave, 456 students (14:1 ± 0:86 y of age) from
44 classes and 22 schools were recruited. A total of 843 partici-
pants (96.8% of wave-1 students, n = 425; and 91.7% of wave-2
students, n = 418) took part in the follow-up investigation 1 y later
(Table 1). The average time between baseline and follow-up was
12.5 months. Of these students, 827 (98.1%) owned a mobile
phone. The sample included more girls (n = 457, 56.4%) than boys
(n = 368, 43.6%). Objectively recorded operator data for at least 6
months between baseline and follow-up were available for 322
participants (38.8%).
Outcome and Exposure Distributions
Due to technical problems with the computerized testing sys-
tem, completed tests for both time points were available for
only 676 (80.2%) of the participants for verbal memory and 670
(79.5%) for figural memory, respectively (Table 2). While the
verbal memory score increased from baseline to follow-up
(mean unit increase ± SD = 1:1 ± 3:0), figural memory score did
not increase in general (mean increase of 0:2 ± 3:2). The intra-
class correlation coefficient (ICC) within individuals was 0.76
for the verbal score, and 0.81 for the figural memory score.
The mean duration of self-reported mobile phone call time
was 17:2 ± 27:6 min=d, in contrast with a mean operator-
recorded time of 3:2 ± 13:3 min=d. After calibration based on
multilevel regression of the subgroup with operator data, the
estimated mean mobile phone call time for the sample as a
whole was 10:6 ± 13:7 min=d. Mean self-reported cordless
phone call duration was 6:2 ± 6:6 min=d (operator data were not
available for calibration of cordless phone use). For media
exposures associated with low RF-EMF, average daily dura-
tions were 56:7 ± 34:3 min=d for mobile phone data traffic and
43:0 ± 56:9 min=d for gaming, and the mean number of text
messages sent per day was 35 ± 21.
The estimated mean cumulative RF-EMF brain dose for the
population as a whole was 858 ± 1,027 mJ=kg per day when esti-
mated using calibrated mobile phone call durations (mean
10:6 min=d) (Table 2). In the operator data sample (n = 322), the
estimated mean cumulative RF-EMF brain dose based on recorded
call durations (mean 3:2 min=d) was 469 ± 814 mJ=kg per day.
On average, the daily cumulative call duration accounted for
80.3% of the estimated cumulative RF-EMF brain dose in the
population as a whole (see Table S3). The proportion for calls
executed on the GSM network was much higher (79.8%) compared
with the UMTS network (0. 5%). In comparison, when using only
data from the operator data sample (n = 322), duration of mobile
phone use accounted for 66% of estimated cumulative RF-EMF
dose (data not shown).
Estimated cumulative RF-EMF brain doses varied among the
five media use groups, primarily due to differences in mobile
phone call duration (Table 2; see also Figure S1). For example,
the Call Preference group (n = 119), which had calibrated daily
mobile phone and cordless call duration estimates of 15:9 ± 11:9
and 10:8 ± 9:6 min=d, respectively, had a mean estimated daily
RF-EMF brain dose of 1,214 ± 1,259 mJ=kg per day, compared
with 551 ± 1,029 mJ=kg per day for the Low Use group (n = 198),
mean calibrated mobile and cordless phone call duration esti-
mates of 5:9 ± 7:7 and 6:0 ± 5:6 min=d, respectively.
Associations between Changes in Memory Performance and
RF-EMF Dose and Media Usage
In the population as a whole, none of the exposure variables were
significantly associated (p < 0:05) with changes in verbal memory
scores (Table 3, Figure 1). However, there was a nonsignificant
association with the cumulative duration of data traffic and the
increase in verbal memory score [score change per IQR: 0.34;
95% confidence interval (CI): −0:05, 0.72; IQR: 55:4 min=d],
which was consistent over both study waves (Figure 2).

 Changes in figural memory score were negatively correlated
with cordless phone calls and, in tendency, with the duration of
mobile phone calls and the cumulative RF-EMF brain dose
(Figure 2). The association with RF-EMF brain dose was non-
significant in the full sample (−0:22 (95% CI: −0:47, 0.03; IQR:
953 mJ=kg per day) and significant in the operator data sample
(−0:26 (95% CI: −0:42, −0:10; IQR: 341 mJ=kg per day). When
analyzing the two subsamples separately, for both study waves,
nonsignificant negative effect estimates for the RF-EMF dose
were seen, although the magnitude of this effect was greater for
the second (n = 288) compared with the first wave (n = 375) but
with a wider confidence interval for the second wave (first wave:
−0:14 (95% CI: −0:42, 0.14); second wave: (−0:58 (95% CI:
−1:17, 0.01); IQR: 953 mJ=kg per day). No association was
observed with variables that were only marginally related to RF-
EMF exposure (cumulative duration of data traffic, cumulative
gaming duration, and cumulative number of text messages).
The association between figural memory score and cumulative
brain dose became significant when analysis was restricted to users
with right-side preference (full sample: n = 532; operator sample:
n = 217) in the laterality analysis (full sample: −0:38; 95% CI:
−0:67, −0:09; IQR: 953 mJ=kg per day; operator sample: −0:29
(95% CI: −0:46, −0:11; IQR: 341 mJ=kg per day) (Figure 3).
When restricted to left-side/no-preference users, the effect esti-
mates were, in general, imprecise due to the small sample size
(full sample: n = 137; operator sample: n = 57). However, a
significant negative association was found for verbal memory
in the operator sample (−0:51; 95% CI: −0:89, −0:13; IQR:
341 mJ=kg per day).
Meta-Analysis over Media Use Groups
The pooled random effects estimate for the association between
cumulative brain dose and figural memory score over the five
media use groups (−0:39; 95% CI: −0:69, −0:09; IQR: 953 mJ=
kg per day) was consistent with the main analysis, and did not sup-
port heterogeneity among the groups (I2 = 0:0%). The pooled
effect for verbal memory score was 0.02 (−0:24, 0.31; IQR:
953 mJ=kg per day; I2 = 0:0%) (see Figure S2).
Discussion
In the present study, an IQR increase in estimated cumulative RF-
EMF brain dose was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in
figural memory score, but was not associated with verbal memory

aMedia use groups were determined by latent class analysis on 11 qualitatively different media use variables as described in Foerster and Röösli (2017).
bUser-group–specific IQRs are displayed for descriptive purposes. For reporting user-group–specific IQRs (see Figure S2), the whole population IQR was used.
cDue to technical problems with the computerized testing system, completed tests for both time points were only available for a reduced number of participants.
dAdjusted via multilevel linear regression estimates calibrated on the objectively recorded duration of calls obtained by mobile phone operators. Models were clustered over schools and the following predictors were selected from the self-
reported questionnaire data: age, gender, daily frequency of mobile phone calls at follow-up, daily frequency of text messages at follow-up, daily duration of mobile phone data traffic at follow-up, daily duration of cordless phone calls at fol-
low-up, difference in daily duration of mobile phone calls between follow-up and baseline.
eCumulative brain dose derived based on the following cumulative exposure variables. Near-field bands (if not indicated otherwise, taken from the questionnaire): daily duration of mobile phone calls (for the whole sample: calibrated via opera-
tor data; for the operator sample: operator recorded), network proportions of UMTS and GSM (for the whole sample: calibrated via operator data and far-field UMTS proportion; for the operator sample: operator recorded), proportion of headset
use, daily duration of cordless phone calls, daily duration of mobile phone data traffic on WiFi and 3G, daily duration of WiFi use via laptop, PC, and tablet, daily duration of mobile phone held close to body; far-field bands: Uplink from sur-
rounding mobile phones and Wifi (modeled via linear regression estimation based on questionnaire and personal measurements), downlink GSM900, downlink GSM1800, downlink UMTS, radio/broadcast, TV [(determined by geospatial prop-
agation modeling using the NISMap software (Bürgi et al. 2010)], DECT (mean of the measurements).

 score. This inverse association of cumulative RF-EMF brain dose
was consistently seen in the full sample analysis and the sub-
group analysis of the two study waves (2012–2014 vs. 2014–
2016), media usage groups, and the operator sample although
the strength of the association differed somewhat. The associa-
tion was stronger in the second than in the first wave (however,
with a wider confidence interval) and statistically significant in
the operator sample, but not in the whole sample with self-
reported exposure (after calibration using operator data). A sig-
nificant decrease in figural memory score with cumulative brain
dose was further seen in laterality analysis for right-side users
of both the full sample and the operator sample only. In left-
side users, in contrast, we found a significant decrease in verbal
memory score for the operator sample. However, there was no
such association for the full sample and estimates for the left-
side users were in general imprecise due to the small sample
size and also less consistent. The more consistent association of
right-side users with a decrease for figural memory and the
decrease for verbal memory score seen in left-side users of the
operator sample might be related to the lateralization of mem-
ory processes (Golby et al. 2001) and requires further study.
Regarding wireless media usage not related to high RF-EMF
exposure, a nonsignificant positive association for cumulative du-
ration of mobile phone data traffic and verbal memory score change
was observed, whereas the coefficients for text messages and gam-
ing were generally small. It is conceivable that a positive signifi-
cant association of verbal memory and data traffic could cover a
potential negative RF-EMF effect on verbal memory if data traffic
and RF-EMF dose are highly correlated. To control for this, we
post hoc calculated the Spearman’s correlation and fitted a regres-
sion model on verbal memory including both variables and
adjusted for the same confounding variables as before. Spearman’s
correlation was weak (q = 0:25), and the linear regression esti-
mates for neither RF-EMF dose nor duration of data traffic changed
majorly in the mutually adjusted model (data not shown).
Strengths and Limitations
The present study is unique in its approach to overcoming the
main challenges in epidemiological research on RF-EMF. We
estimated individual RF-EMF brain doses for the population as a
whole using objectively recorded operator data from a subset of
participants to calibrate self-reported call duration and thus
reduce misclassification. The operator-recorded data allowed us
to estimate the very exposure-relevant proportion of calls on the
GSM and UMTS networks (Erdreich et al. 2007; Gati et al.
2009). In our sample, the respective brain dose contributions
were 79.8% (GSM) and 0.5% (UMTS) (see Table S2).
The modeling allowed addressing the associations with mo-
bile phone use and RF-EMF brain dose separately to evaluate
potential residual confounding of lifestyle and media use related
to wireless device use itself. These factors might act on human
health, cognition, and behavior independently from a potential bi-
ological radiation effect (Kuss et al. 2014; Kuss and Griffiths
2011, 2012; Roser et al. 2016). To control for such confounding,
we adjusted our analysis for age, gender, school level, parents’
education, alcohol consumption, and physical activity at follow-
up, and the time and change in height between baseline and

 follow-up. In addition, we estimated associations with media
exposures associated with low RF-EMF exposures (minutes of
gaming, minutes of mobile phone data traffic, and numbers of texts
sent each day) to assess the potential impact of media use unre-
lated to RF-EMF.
In addition, we applied a new approach to control for residual
confounding by stratifying the analysis for the RF-EMF brain dose
over independent patterns of media use. Separate estimates for stu-
dents classified according to the five media use patterns were
similar among the groups for both verbal and figural memory,
with I2 statistics indicating little or no heterogeneity, and pooled
estimates were consistent with estimates based on the main analy-
sis. This pattern does not support major bias from uncontrolled
confounding and is compatible with associations due to biophysi-
cal effects of RF-EMF, rather than effects of media use unrelated
to RF-EMF. However, sample sizes within the five media use
groups were small, and residual confounding cannot be ruled out
based on this analysis.

 This study put a lot of emphasis on the exposure assessment and
dose calculation. Information for the far-field exposure was
retrieved from propagation models (Bürgi et al. 2010) and from per-
sonal measurements in 148 children (Roser et al. 2017). Operator-
recorded mobile phone data is an asset, and, to our knowledge, it
has not been available for other epidemiological studies of children
and adolescents. Although operator data are objectively recorded,
they have a disadvantage in that calls on other people’s phones are
not recorded. Furthermore, information on short message services
does not represent texting behavior of adolescents using mostly
Internet-based applications such as WhatsApp, and besides, the du-
ration of data traffic and cordless phone use was not available from
the operator. Thus, for these variables, the corresponding self-
reported data had to be used for dose estimation as in the operator
sample.
Uncertainty in the exposure assessment and in the RF-EMF
dose calculations cannot be avoided. Estimation of SAR assumes
a typical distance between emitting devices and body and average

 absorption characteristics of the body. But all of these aspects are
variable in reality. A validation study could not be confirmed
given than dose is not directly measurable and can only be
computed.
Our study participants were recruited from the four common
public school levels in urban and rural areas of Switzerland.
Neither private nor religious schools were included because
they play a minor role in Switzerland. All schools were located
in Swiss German-speaking cantons, although Switzerland also
has large French-, Italian-, and Rhaeto- Romanic-speaking
areas. Generalizability might thus be restricted to public
schools in German-speaking Switzerland. However, because
RF-EMF brain dose is a biological measure, the exposure route
should not differ among adolescents in general. Loss to follow-
up was low (5.8%), but selection bias cannot be ruled out given
that participation rates at baseline were only 37% for the first-
wave (2012–2014) but 56% for the second-wave (2014–2016)
study samples.

eling of relevant near- and far-field exposure sources. The most relevant predictors—duration of mobile phone calls and network proportion—were derived
directly by network operators for the operator data sample. For the whole sample, these parameters were calibrated via multilevel linear regression models, pre-

 Comparison with Previous Analysis
The association between memory and RF-EMF exposure in the
2012–2014 sample has been analyzed previously (Schoeni et al.
2015). In the present work, we applied an improved RF-EMF dose
estimation to the whole HERMES sample. The Spearman’s corre-
lation between the resulting new RF-EMF brain dose and the for-
mer dose estimate in the 2012–2014 sample was q = 0:58,
demonstrating inherent uncertainties in dose estimation. The main
difference compared with the previous dose modeling (Roser et al.
2015) was the use of operator calibrated self-reported call duration
and different SAR values. Our new estimate of the first sample
wave was of similar magnitude but less significant [−0:14 (−0:42,
0.14) per IQR of 953 mJ=kg per day] than in the previous analysis
reported by Schoeni et al. (2015) [−0:26 (95% CI: −0:42, −0:10)
per IQR of 1,579 mJ=kg per day].
Compared with the previous analyses, we have improved the
dose calculations by various aspects. First, in the previous study,
self-reported mobile phone use data was used for the dose calcu-
lation. It is well known that adolescents tend to overestimate du-
ration of use and that the extent of overestimation is related to
various sociodemographic factors (Aydin et al. 2011). This time,
we used operator-recorded mobile phone data to adjust self-
reported mobile phone use in order to reduce the overestimation
of self-reported use. Consecutively, this led to a lower average
RF-EMF dose estimation that might be closer to reality. The cali-
bration was based on the assumption, that the factor and pattern
by which participants overestimate their use could be extrapo-
lated from the operator data sample. However, it must be noted
that a large majority (approximately 75%) of the operator sample
were participants from the first study wave. This might affect the
generalizability of the operator sample–based estimates to the
sample as a whole, in particular if relationships among self-reported
variables considered for calibration and the operator-recorded data
would be different for the first and second study wave due to
increasing dissemination of smartphones in the study sample and
the expansion of the UMTS network in the study region. However,
differences in media usage behavior between the study waves might
be more related to smartphone-specific applications rather than mo-
bile phone calls (Foerster and Röösli 2017). Second, in the frame-
work of the EU project GERoNiMO (Generalized EMF Research
using Novel MethOds), new SAR estimates have been computed
for various near- and far-field exposure conditions. Most relevant,
these SAR estimates are based on the adolescent models Billie and
Louis from the virtual population [for details see “1. Numeric simu-
lations of brain gray matter specific absorption rates (SAR)” in the
Supplemental Material], whereas in the past only SAR calculations
from adult phantoms were available.
Brain Exposure and Differential Memory-Related Neuronal
Circuits
Our findings require confirmation in other populations but sug-
gest that RF-EMF brain exposure may have an adverse effect on
figural memory functions in adolescents. The decrease in figural
memory score with an IQR increase in exposure was 0.22 (95%
CI: −0:47, 0.03; IQR: 953 mJ=kg per day) in the full sample
(n = 669) and 0.26 (95% CI: −0:42, −0:10; 341 mJ=kg per day) in
the operator sample (n = 274). To put this difference into context,
in our main model adjusting for various factors, we observed a
mean difference in figural memory score of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.13,
0.69) between adolescents from a lower school level (e.g., sec-
ondary school level C) to the next higher one (i.e., secondary
school level B). Memory functions continue to develop in adoles-
cents, and the ability to maintain and manipulate multiple spatial
units (which is tested by the figural memory task) continues to
develops until 15 y of age (Luciana et al. 2005).
Different brain areas and activation patterns are involved in
neural memory processing, which is measured by different cogni-
tive tests. Due to the differing specificity of cognitive tests, results
often cannot be compared directly. Although we found decreases
in figural memory, some experimental and epidemiological studies
on RF-EMF found improvements in working memory perform-
ance. Working memory is usually assessed via reaction time tasks
such as the n-back paradigm, where participants need to react in
an accurate manner on a stimulus after a short time interval as fast
as possible. This type of memory is also known as working atten-
tion and is related to very early stages of memory where stimuli
are held actively in mind before being stored (Baddeley and Hitch
1974). For working memory, main brain activity is seen in execu-
tive structures involved in decision-making, predominantly the an-
terior cingulate and dorsolateral and inferior prefrontal cortices
(Jansma et al. 2000). In addition to voluntary encoding, the mem-
ory processes evaluated in our study require consolidation (stor-
age) of a stimulus and its subsequent recognition (retrieval) after a
short period of time. In these later stages of memory, the activation
shifts toward the temporal (verbal and object information process-
ing) or parietal (spatial information processing) areas and later to
the hippocampal and parahippocampal areas (memory storage and
retrieval) (Brewer et al. 1998; Schacter and Wagner 1999; Schon
et al. 2004). The memory tasks used in the present study might be
more reliable for detecting alterations in adolescents’ memory
functions given that its execution involves more areas prone to
high RF-EMF exposure from a mobile phone at the ear. This may
partly contribute to the ambiguous results between our study and
studies testing the working memory. However differences among
populations with regard to specific exposures (or exposure pat-
terns), differences in susceptibility, and other noncausal factors
related to uncontrolled confounding or other sources of bias cannot
be completely excluded.
Visual memory tasks similar to those applied in our study were
also used in the Australian MoRPhEUS and ExPOSURE cohort
studies in adolescents and primary school children. In line with
our results, these studies found less accurate answers in the most
frequent mobile phone and cordless phone callers (Abramson et al.
2009; Redmayne et al. 2013).
Although preliminary, findings from the laterality analysis
might reflect separate lateralized neural pathways for verbal and
figural memory. Figural and spatial memory processing are asso-
ciated more with the right hemisphere of the brain, and verbal
and auditory processing with the left hemisphere (Golby et al.
2001; Nagel et al. 2013). A more detailed description of the neu-
ral paths involved in the generation of new memory gives the in-
fluential model of working memory of Baddeley and Hitch
(1974). The model differentiates between the visuospatial sketch-
pad for visual and the phonological loop for verbal information,
running through the right and left temporal lobe, respectively.
Evidence of a possible laterality effect in our study population
might be consistent with impairment of this component step in
object information memory processing.
How RF-EMF interacts with the brain is still unclear and no bio-
physical model exists for SAR values that do not noticeably increase
the body temperature (International Commission on Non-Ionizing
Radiation Protection 2010; Redmayne 2016). It may be speculated
that our results are related to relatively consistently observed altera-
tions in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during sleep in random-
ized crossover studies of participants exposed to mobile phone
radiation prior to sleep (Loughran et al. 2012; Lustenberger et al.
2013; Regel et al. 2007; Schmid et al. 2012). Disturbed sleep nega-
tively affects memory consolidation, in particular, in relation to

 abstract and complex tasks involving higher brain functions
(Kopasz et al. 2010). Lustenberger et al. (2013) observed reduced
overnight performance improvement in a motor sequence task af-
ter a night with RF-EMF exposure compared with the sham con-
dition. Thus, future studies should clarify whether RF-EMF has
an impact on sleep-facilitated learning processes via altered sleep
brain activity.
Conclusion
We found preliminary evidence suggesting that RF-EMF may
affect brain functions such as figural memory in regions that are
most exposed during mobile phone use. Our findings do not
provide conclusive evidence of causal effects and should be
interpreted with caution until confirmed in other populations.
Associations with media use parameters with low RF-EMF
exposures did not provide clear or consistent support of effects
of media use unrelated to RF-EMF (with the possible exception
of consistent positive associations between verbal memory and
data traffic duration). It is not yet clear which brain processes
could be potentially affected and what biophysical mechanism
may play a role. Potential long-term risk can be minimized by
avoiding high brain-exposure situations as occurs when using a
mobile phone with maximum power close to the ear because of,
for example, bad network quality.
