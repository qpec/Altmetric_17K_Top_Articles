Abstract
BACKGROUND—U.S. emergency department visits for cutaneous abscess have increased with 
the emergence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The role of antibiotics for 
patients with a drained abscess is unclear.
METHODS—We conducted a randomized trial at five U.S. emergency departments to determine 
whether trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, respectively, twice 
daily, for 7 days) would be superior to placebo in outpatients older than 12 years of age who had 
an uncomplicated abscess that was being treated with drainage. The primary outcome was clinical 
cure of the abscess, assessed 7 to 14 days after the end of the treatment period.
RESULTS—The median age of the participants was 35 years (range, 14 to 73); 45.3% of the 
participants had wound cultures that were positive for MRSA. In the modified intention-to-treat 
population, clinical cure of the abscess occurred in 507 of 630 participants (80.5%) in the 
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group versus 454 of 617 participants (73.6%) in the placebo 
group (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). In 
the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the 
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo 
group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 3.2 to 11.2; P<0.001). Trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole was superior to placebo with respect to most secondary outcomes in the per-
protocol population, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs.

 8.6%; difference, −5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −8.2 to −2.2), skin infections at new sites (3.1% 
vs. 10.3%; difference, −7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −10.4 to −4.1), and infections in household 
members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, −2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, −4.6 to −0.2) 7 to 14 days 
after the treatment period. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole was associated with slightly more 
gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than placebo. At 7 to 14 days after the treatment period, 
invasive infections had developed in 2 of 524 participants (0.4%) in the trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole group and in 2 of 533 participants (0.4%) in the placebo group; at 42 to 56 days 
after the treatment period, an invasive infection had developed in 1 participant (0.2%) in the 
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group.
CONCLUSIONS—In settings in which MRSA was prevalent, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole 
treatment resulted in a higher cure rate among patients with a drained cutaneous abscess than 
placebo. (Funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; ClinicalTrials.gov 
number, NCT00729937.)
Between 1993 and 2005, annual emergency department visits for skin and soft-tissue 
infections in the United States increased from 1.2 million to 3.4 million, primarily because 
of an increased incidence of abscesses.1,2 During this period, community-associated 
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) emerged as the most common cause of 
purulent skin and soft-tissue infections in many parts of the world.3 Trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole, which has retained in vitro activity against community-associated MRSA, 
is among the most commonly prescribed antibiotics to treat these infections.4
The primary treatment of a cutaneous abscess is drainage.5 Whether adjunctive antibiotics 
lead to improved outcomes in patients with uncomplicated abscesses or just more cost and 
side effects is unclear. Previous investigations, which had small numbers of participants, did 
not show a benefit of antibiotic treatment.6–15 Larger studies are required to show relatively 
small differences in cure rates, because drainage alone may result in resolution in more than 
80% of cases.16 To determine the efficacy of adjunctive antibiotics, we compared outcomes 
among 1265 emergency department patients presenting with an uncomplicated cutaneous 
abscess and treated with drainage who were randomly assigned to receive trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole or placebo.
Methods
Design
We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial to determine whether trimetho-
prim–sulfamethoxazole, administered for 7 days, would be superior to placebo in emergency 
department patients who had a skin abscess receiving drainage and who were treated on an 
outpatient basis. The full protocol and statistical analysis plan are available with the full text 
of this article at NEJM.org. The institutional review board at each site approved the trial. 
Trial sites and conduct are described in the Supplementary Appendix, available at 
NEJM.org.

 Trial Population
From April 2009 to April 2013, we enrolled patients older than 12 years of age who had a 
cutaneous lesion that was suspected to be an abscess on the basis of physical examination 
and ultra-sonography or examination alone and that was found to have purulent material on 
surgical exploration. We enrolled only participants who had a lesion that had been present 
for less than 1 week and that measured at least 2.0 cm in diameter (as measured from the 
borders of induration, if the lesion was fluctuant, or from the borders of the abscess cavity 
on ultrasonogra-phy, if the lesion was not fluctuant), and for whom their treating clinician 
intended outpatient treatment. Eligible patients had to agree to return for reevaluation and to 
provide written informed consent. Exclusion criteria are described in the Supplementary 
Appendix.
Interventions and Baseline Evaluation
Before initiation of the trial, trial personnel underwent standardized training on the general 
technique17 and trial-specific procedures for incision and drainage (see the Supplementary 
Appendix). Using double-blind, Web-based randomization, we assigned participants in a 1:1 
ratio to a 7-day course of trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (four single-strength pills, each 
containing 80 mg of trimethoprim and 400 mg of sulfamethoxazole, twice daily) or placebo 
(four pills containing microcrystalline cellulose, twice daily). The dose of trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole was based on existing recommendations.18 We dispensed the active drug 
or placebo in blister packs; the first dose was taken from the participant’s blister pack and 
administered after drainage of the abscess and before discharge from the emergency 
department. A participant’s study-group assignment could be unblinded before the 
participant’s completion of the trial only if the participant had a treatment failure or adverse 
event for which an acceptable alternative treatment could not be given and the participant’s 
best care would be threatened if unblinding of the study-group assignment was delayed. An 
independent contract research organization (EMMES, Rockville, MD) that developed the 
randomization code performed centralized randomization, with assignments made 
independently at each site. Details of the randomization and blinding methods are available 
in the Supplementary Appendix. All medications and placebo were purchased.
We collected baseline clinical information, including the dimensions of the abscess cavity 
(assessed with the use of both ultrasonography and probe) and the dimensions of erythema 
and swelling or induration. We sent drainage specimens for standard aerobic bacterial 
culture and susceptibility testing at site hospitals. Investigators were not aware of the results 
of these tests.
Outcome Measures
We performed evaluations at follow-up visits on day 3 or 4 (during the treatment period), 
day 8 to 10 (end of the treatment period), day 14 to 21 (test-of-cure assessment), and day 49 
to 63 (extended follow-up). We assessed adherence by inspecting blister packs for retained 
pills. If the participant lost the blister pack, we assessed adherence by means of the record 
on a memory aid (a booklet that was formatted according to date and time of dose and in 
which the participant recorded the doses taken) and participant interview.

 Descriptions of trial populations, including the modified intention-to-treat 1 (mITT-1) 
population, the per-protocol population, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
guidance early end-point population,19 and definitions of clinical cure and clinical failure are 
provided in Table 1 (the definition of and results for the modified intention-to-treat 2 
[mITT-2] population are provided in the Supplementary Appendix). The primary outcome 
was clinical cure of the abscess lesion at the test-of-cure visit (i.e., 7 to 14 days after the end 
of the treatment period). Participants were classified as having had a clinical cure if they did 
not meet the criteria for clinical failure at or before the test-of-cure visit. Standardized 
physical examination criteria for clinical failure were developed by investigator consensus 
before the initiation of the trial and varied according to the time since the participant started 
receiving treatment or placebo, as described in detail in Table 1. All participants who met 
failure criteria discontinued the treatment or placebo and started treatment with an antibiotic 
other than trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, in addition to undergoing any additional surgical 
drainage that was deemed necessary. For the mITT-1 analysis, participants who were lost to 
follow-up were considered to have had clinical failure, and those who did not present for the 
test-of-cure visit but could be reached by telephone were classified as having had clinical 
failure if they reported new antibiotic treatment for their skin infection. Outcome-assessment 
methods and interrater agreement are described in the Supplementary Appendix.
Secondary outcomes were specified before trial initiation and included composite cure (i.e., 
resolution of all symptoms and signs of infection, or improvement such that no additional 
antibiotic therapy or surgical drainage procedure was necessary), surgical drainage 
procedures, changes in erythema size, the presence of swelling or induration and tenderness, 
invasive infections (i.e., sepsis, bacteremia, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, 
necrotizing fasciitis, or pneumonia), skin infections at the same site and at a different site, 
hospitalizations, similar infections in household contacts, days missed from normal 
activities, days missed from work or school, and days that analgesics were used.
Statistical Analysis
We designed our trial as a superiority trial. Our primary hypothesis was that the cure rate 
among participants with a drained cutaneous abscess who received trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole would be greater than the cure rate among those who received placebo. 
We estimated that enrollment of 590 participants would provide a power of 90% to detect an 
absolute between-group difference of 7.5 percentage points, assuming a cure rate of 90% in 
the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group in the per-protocol population, at a type I error 
rate of 5%. During a prespecified interim analysis, the sample-size estimate was revised to 
1265 participants to reflect the observed cure rate. We designated the primary analysis as the 
between-group difference in clinical cure rates at the test-of-cure visit in the per-protocol 
population and also conducted analyses in the modified intention-to-treat and FDA guidance 
early end-point populations. We chose to conduct the primary outcome analysis in the per-
protocol population to most precisely evaluate outcomes among participants who returned 
for physical evaluation and treatment effects among those with good adherence with a 
complete treatment course. A determination of superiority required the lower boundary of 
the 95% confidence interval for the between-group difference in clinical cure rates to be 
greater than zero. We analyzed secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population, for

 which relatively complete data were available, and report 95% confidence intervals of the 
between-group difference in outcome rates.
Results
Characteristics of the Patients and of the Lesions
Of 1265 enrolled patients, 1247 (98.6%) were randomly assigned to trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole or placebo and received at least one dose; 1057 participants (83.6%) 
qualified for the per-protocol population (Fig. 1). Of 1247 who took at least one dose, 807 
(64.7%) were determined to be 100% adherent (412 in the placebo group and 395 in the 
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group), and 214 (17.2%) took 76 to 99% of the doses (94 in 
the placebo group and 120 in the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group).
Baseline characteristics in the mITT-1 population are summarized in Table 2. The median 
age was 35 years (range, 14 to 73), and 58.2% of the participants were male. A total of 95 
participants (7.6%) had a history of MRSA infection. The median length, width, and depth 
of the abscesses, as measured by probe, were 2.5 cm, 2.0 cm, and 1.5 cm, respectively. The 
median length and width of erythema were 6.5 cm and 5.0 cm, respectively. MRSA was 
found in 45.3% of the participants; 97.4% of MRSA isolates were susceptible to 
trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. Of 410 MRSA isolates that were tested, 394 (96.1%) were 
CC8, Panton–Valentine leukocidin (PVL)–positive, and SCCmec type IV, traits that are 
strongly associated with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) type USA300.
Clinical Cure and Failure
Clinical cure rates are summarized in Table 3 and Figure S1 in the Supplementary 
Appendix. The abscess cure rate was 80.5% in the trime-thoprim–sulfamethoxazole group 
and 73.6% in the placebo group in the mITT-1 population (difference, 6.9 percentage points; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 11.7; P = 0.005). If we assumed that all participants in 
the mITT-1 population who were lost to follow-up (58 in the tri-methoprim–
sulfamethoxazole group and 39 in the placebo group) had a clinical cure rather than clinical 
failure, the cure rates would be 89.7% and 79.9%, respectively (difference, 9.8 percentage 
points; 95% CI, 5.7 to 13.9; P<0.001). In the per-protocol population, clinical cure occurred 
in 487 of 524 participants (92.9%) in the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group versus 457 
of 533 participants (85.7%) in the placebo group (difference, 7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, 
3.2 to 11.2; P<0.001). The cure rate was significantly higher in the trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole group than in the placebo group in the mITT-2 population but not in the 
FDA guidance early end-point population (i.e., participants in whom response was assessed 
at 48 to 72 hours). Except for two participants in the placebo group who received a 
subsequent diagnosis of a local invasive infection at the site of the original abscess lesion, all 
participants not lost to follow-up who were deemed to have had clinical failure ultimately 
had a resolution of their initial skin infection.
Secondary Outcomes
Secondary outcomes in the per-protocol population are summarized in Table 4.

 outcomes, resulting in lower rates of subsequent surgical drainage procedures (3.4% vs. 
8.6%; difference, −5.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −8.2 to −2.2), skin infections at a new site 
(3.1% vs. 10.3%; difference, −7.2 percentage points; 95% CI, −10.4 to −4.1), and infections 
among household members (1.7% vs. 4.1%; difference, −2.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 
−4.6 to −0.2) through the test-of-cure visit. By the test-of-cure visit (7 to 14 days after the 
end of the treatment period), invasive infections had developed in two participants (0.4%) in 
the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group (unrelated to their original abscess) and in two 
participants (0.4%) in the placebo group (a necrotizing infection in the abdominal wall and 
prepatellar bursitis of the knee at the site of the original abscesses, both due to MRSA); by 
the extended follow-up visit (42 to 56 days after the end of the treatment period), an invasive 
infection had developed in one participant (0.2%) in the trime-thoprim–sulfamethoxazole 
group (unrelated to the original abscess).
Adverse Events
Adverse events are described in the Supplementary Appendix. Overall rates of adverse 
events were similar in the trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole group and the placebo group, and 
most events were considered to be mild. The most common adverse events involved the 
gastrointestinal system (42.7% and 36.1%, respectively); no cases of Clostridium difficile–
associated diarrhea occurred. No treatment-associated serious or life-threatening adverse 
events occurred. Rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events were also similar 
in the two groups (1.9% and 0.6%, respectively). There were two deaths (one in each group); 
they were considered to be unrelated to the active drug or placebo.
Discussion
In this trial involving 1265 patients with a drained cutaneous abscess, we found that patients 
who received trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole (at doses of 320 mg and 1600 mg, 
respectively, twice daily, for 7 days) had a higher cure rate than those who received placebo. 
We also found that many secondary outcomes were better in the trime-thoprim–
sulfamethoxazole group than in the placebo group, including fewer subsequent surgical 
drainage procedures, new skin infections, and infections among household members through 
6 to 8 weeks after the end of the treatment period. Participants who received trimethoprim–
sulfamethoxazole had only slightly more gastrointestinal side effects (mostly mild) than 
those who received placebo and had no serious or life-threatening drug-related adverse 
reactions.
Previous studies have not shown a benefit of adjunctive antibiotics.5–14 We are aware of two 
randomized, placebo-controlled trials since the emergence of community-associated MRSA 
that used an antibiotic active against these infections (i.e., trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole), 
one involving 161 children and another involving 212 adults.14,15 Both studies failed to 
show a significant between-group difference in the short-term response rate with respect to 
the primary lesion.
Because cure rates with drainage alone among patients with simple abscesses may exceed 
80%, studies with large sample sizes are necessary to test for small differences in response 
rates. Spell-berg and colleagues20 concluded that placebo-controlled studies suggesting an

 absolute advantage in cure rate with antibiotic treatment of 5 to 10 percentage points were 
underpowered to confirm this difference statistically. We powered our trial assuming an 
effect size of 7.5 percentage points and found that trimethoprim–sulfa-methoxazole 
treatment resulted in a significantly higher abscess cure rate than did placebo.
We found that the cure rate with respect to the primary lesion was approximately 7 percent-
age points higher with trimethoprim–sulfa-methoxazole than with placebo. Thus, adjunctive 
oral treatment with trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole — which is inexpensive, appears to be 
safe, and is associated with a higher cure rate of the primary lesion than that with placebo — 
offers the possibility of lower rates of costly subsequent medical visits, surgeries, and 
hospitalizations and of new infections among patients and their household contacts. On the 
other hand, drainage alone was associated with a similar rate of response at 48 to 72 hours 
and a high overall cure rate. Trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole can cause uncommon but 
serious complications such C. difficile colitis, renal and electrolyte problems, drug 
interactions, and rare life-threatening reactions (e.g., Stevens–Johnson syndrome, at an 
estimated rate of 3 cases per 100,000 exposed persons21). Increased antibiotic use may 
promote bacterial resistance. A similar National Institutes of Health–funded trial 
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00730028) may also shed light on the efficacy of 
adjunctive antibiotics.
Practice guidelines for abscess treatment state that drainage is sufficient for many patients 
and, primarily on the basis of expert opinion, recommend adjunctive antibiotics for patients 
who have certain clinical or demographic characteristics, including the systemic 
inflammatory response syndrome, diabetes, very young or very old age, an infected site with 
a diameter of more than 5 cm, and surrounding cellulitis.22–24 Participants in this trial had 
typical skin abscesses, which were generally small (most only 2 to 3 cm). However, most 
participants had a total lesion size, including associated erythema, of more than 5 cm, and 
many met other guideline criteria for antibiotic treatment.
This trial has a number of limitations. First, although patients with common coexisting 
conditions, such as diabetes, were not excluded, physicians may have been biased against 
enrolling some patients who were perceived as being at higher risk. Second, although a 
combination of 160 mg of trimethoprim and 800 mg of sulfamethoxazole twice daily should 
achieve serum and blister fluid levels above MRSA minimal inhibitory concentrations,25 we 
chose a dose of 320 mg of trimethoprim and 1600 mg of sulfamethoxazole twice daily to 
best test efficacy and for consistency with existing recommenda-tions.18 Third, we had some 
degree of nonadherence, which would bias against trimethoprim– sulfamethoxazole, but the 
higher dose may have mitigated against inadequate treatment. Fourth, we provided training 
for adequate abscess drain- age; however, to the extent that some abscesses may not have 
been fully drained, potential cure rates could be higher, particularly in the placebo group. 
Fifth, the standardized methods we created to determine clinical failure that necessitated a 
change in the study regimen may not be valid, although we are unaware of any validated 
method, and ours had good interrater agreement and were associated with a high cure rate 
among those who could be assessed by this method (i.e., the per-protocol population). 
Finally, significant differences between treatment groups with respect to secondary 
outcomes may be due to chance, although these generally favored trime-thoprim–

 sulfamethoxazole, and, in the case of subsequent infections at new sites, were consistent 
with results of secondary outcome analyses in previous studies.14,15 These outcomes should 
be further explored in future studies.

 Figure 1. Enrollment, Randomization, and Follow-Up of Patients with a Drained Uncomplicated 
Cutaneous Abscess
Participants received a 7-day course of trial therapy; follow-up visits occurred on day 3 or 4 
(during the treatment period), day 8 to 10 (end of the treatment period), day 14 to 21 (test-
of-cure assessment), and day 49 to 63 (extended follow-up). The safety population included 
participants who received the study drug or placebo and did not return 100% of the doses at 
the end of the treatment period. The modified intention-to-treat 1 (mITT-1) population 
included participants who took at least one dose of active drug or placebo and had an in-
person or telephone assessment through the test-of-cure visit, as well as those who withdrew

 from the trial, were lost to follow-up before final classification, or had missing or unassigned 
outcomes. The per-protocol population included participants who either took at least 75% of 
the doses provided during the first 5 days of the treatment period and had an in-person test-
of-cure visit or were determined to have had clinical failure before the test-of-cure visit and 
took at least 75% of the doses provided during the first 48 hours of the treatment period. 
Participants who were excluded from the per-protocol population could have more than one 
reason for exclusion. The Food and Drug Administration guidance early end point 
(FDAGEEP) population included participants who took at least one dose of trial medication 
and completed the follow-up evaluation at 48 to 72 hours after the study drug or placebo was 
initiated. For information on the modified intention to treat 2 (mITT-2) population, see the 
Supplementary Appendix. TMP/SMX denotes trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole.

Definitions of Trial Populations and Outcomes among Participants with a Drained Cutaneous Abscess Who 
Were Assigned to Trimethoprim–Sulfamethoxazole or Placebo.*
Population
Description
Outcome Definition
Modified intention-
to-treat 1
Participants who took at least one dose of the active
drug or placebo and had an in-person or telephone
assessment through the test-of-cure visit, as well
as those who withdrew from the trial, were lost to
follow-up before final classification, or had miss-
ing or unassigned outcomes
Participants were considered to have had a clinical cure if they
did not meet the criteria for clinical failure at or before the
test-of-cure visit. The criteria for clinical failure were as follows:
fever (attributable to the infection), an increase in the maximal
dimension of erythema by >25% from baseline, or worsening
of wound swelling and tenderness by the visit during the
treatment period (day 3 or 4); fever, no decrease in the maxi-
mal dimension of erythema from baseline, or no decrease in
swelling or tenderness by the visit at the end of the treatment
period (day 8–10); and fever or more than minimal erythema,
swelling, or tenderness by the test-of-cure visit (day 14–21).
Participants who withdrew from the trial, were lost to follow-
up before final classification, or had missing or unassigned
outcomes were classified as having had clinical failure.
Per-protocol
Participants who either took ≥75% of the total doses
of study drug or placebo during first 5 days and
had an in-person test-of-cure visit or were deter-
mined to have had clinical failure before the test-
of-cure visit and received ≥75% of the doses pro-
vided during the first 48 hr of the treatment period
Participants were considered to have had a clinical cure if they
did not meet the criteria for clinical failure (see examination
criteria above) at or before the test-of-cure visit.
FDAGEEP19
Participants who received at least one dose of study
drug or placebo and completed the follow-up
evaluation at 48–72 hr after the start of trial
treatment
A clinical response was defined by a decrease or no increase in
the length, width, and area of erythema from baseline, no
worsening in swelling or induration, and the absence of
fever (i.e., temperature <37.7°C) on the basis of a trial clini-
cian’s assessment.
Safety
Participants who underwent randomization, received
the active drug or placebo, and did not return 100%
of the doses at the end of the treatment period
Adverse events were coded according to the Medical Dictionary
for Regulatory Activities, version 17.0. Investigators catego-
rized adverse events as related or not related to the active
drug or placebo.
*All participants who were deemed by a trial clinician to have had clinical failure discontinued the trial regimen and started antibiotic treatment 
other than trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole. FDAGEEP denotes Food and Drug Administration guidance early end point.
