ABSTRACT: Photography was employed for the quantitation and differ-
entiation of G- and V-series nerve agent mimics with the use of self-propagating
cascades. Fluoride anion and thiols, released from a G-nerve agent mimic (i.e.,
diisopropyl fluorophosphate) and a V-nerve agent mimic (i.e., demeton-S-
methyl), respectively, were used to initiate self-propagating cascades that
amplify fluorescence signals exponentially in a ratiometric manner. A homemade
LEGO dark-box, a cell phone, and 96-well plates were employed to collect
photographs of the fluorescence response to the analytes. The photographic
images were digitally processed in the 1931 xyY color space using a watershed
and morphological erosion algorithm to generate chromaticity vs concentration
calibration curves. We show that the two different amplification routines are
selective for their analyte class and thus successfully discriminated the G- and V-
series nerve agent mimics. Further, accurate concentrations of the analytes are determined using the chromaticity and LEGO
approach given herein, thus demonstrating a simple and on-site constructible/portable device for use in the field.
■ INTRODUCTION
Nerve agents are among the most lethal chemical agents
developed for military use. They are divided into two types: G-
series and V-series, of which the former are phosphoryl
fluorides, such as sarin (GB), soman (GD), and tabun (GF),
while the latter are phosphoryl thiols, such as O-ethyl-S-(2-
diisopropylaminoethyl)methylphos-phonothioate (VX), O-iso-
butyl-S-2-diethyl-aminoethyl methyl-phosphonothioate
(RVX), and O-butyl-S-2-diethyl-aminoethyl methylphospho-
nothioate (CVX) (Figure 1). The species are odorless and
tasteless, and possess very low median lethal doses (LD50 from
0.069 mg/kg to 117.9 mg/kg for G-nerve agents, and 0.0082
mg/kg to 1.402 mg/kg for V-nerve agents).1,2 Due to the
increased toxicity and lower volatility compared to the G-
agents, the LD50 of V-agents is 10 times lower, and thus these
agents are more dangerous than G-nerve agents. Both V- and
G-agents are threats for humanity, particularly in a modern
world facing the very real possibility of terrorist attacks. This
threat has been a motivation for research into the development
of user-friendly and sensitive chemosensors for such agents.3
However, to date, few strategies have been reported for the
detection of nerve agents demonstrating high sensitivity and
quantitative accuracy, and with the ability to discriminate
between the V- and G-agents, as well as an ease of operation
that makes the entire analysis field deployable.
In terms of optical sensing methods currently being
explored, exponential signal amplification offers significant
advantages to conventional detection, such as significantly
larger diagnostic signals, increased sensitivity, and accompany-
ing lower limits of detection (LOD), which continually inspire
the development of new approaches in this field.4 In the past

 decade, a series of self-propagating cascades for analyte
quantitation and signal amplification in response to H2O2,
fluoride, and thiols were developed.5−9 One equivalent of
analyte triggers the cascades to generate hundreds to
thousands of equivalents of further triggers, and thus the
signals generated grow exponentially. In previous studies, we
designed and developed self-propagating cascades to detect
fluoride and thiols, as well as their application in sensing of G-
and V-type phosphoryl nerve agent mimics by monitoring the
fluoride/thiol products (Figure 2).10−12
These approaches, as well as many others, exploited
ratiometric signaling. Ratiometric fluorescence sensing has
the potential to provide high sensitivity and inherent reliability
due to the self-calibration provided by monitoring two (or
more) emissions.13 In the exploration of ratiometric
fluorescence probes, scientists such as Nagano14−16 and
Qian17−19 have made contributions to the sensing of transition
metals. Among many of their ratiometric designs, the 4-
aminonaphthalimide chromophore is widely employed due to
its advantageous photophysical and photochemical properties,
synthetic accessibility, and tunable internal charge transfer
(ICT).20 Hence, in the two self-propagating cascades
introduced above, we employed 4-aminonaphthalimide via
functionalizing the electron donating 4-amine moiety. The
result is fluorometric red shifts within the visible color region
after reaction of the probe and the proper analyte due to a
recovery of a “push−pull” π-electron system, which was visibly
seen as a different color of emission and could be captured via
photography for color analysis (vide infra).
Traditionally, to record and interpret the optical changes,
spectroscopy measurements such as fluorescence spectroscopy,
ultraviolet−visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray photoelec-
tron spectroscopy, circularly dichroism spectropolarimetry,
etc., utilizing sophisticated instruments are required. Con-
sequently, the instrumentation is usually costly, not readily
field deployable, and its operation can be time-consuming.
Thus, simple, efficient, and ideally integrated systems are in
great demand.21
To answer this need, we herein report an image analysis
pipeline to perform ratiometric fluorescence sensing using a
common cellular phone22−24 and a housing built from
LEGO.25 Briefly, photographic images of the reactions in
wells of a 96-well plate are digitally processed to identify the
individual reaction wells, and their pixel values are sampled.
Pixel chromaticities for each well are quantitatively mapped
onto the CIE 1931 xyY color space.26 Chromaticities from
calibration wells with known analyte concentrations form a
calibration curve in the color space against which the other
reactions’ chromaticities are then compared. This is sufficient
to infer analyte concentration in each reaction. We thus
combine ubiquitous digital photographic technology, a simply
constructed box, with our fluoride and thiol self-propagating
protocols to create portable devices for use in the
discrimination and quantitation of G- and V-nerve agent
mimics.
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Procedure and Tools for Photo Images. As an initial
test of the fluoride self-propagating cascade, we used TBAF as
the trigger and observed the fluorescence produced by the
cascade. We then tested the cascade for the detection of DFP,
using the fluoride released from the chemical reaction between
DFP and a previously reported oximate on a resin in tert-butyl
methyl ether (TBME).10 For an initial test of the thiol self-
propagating cascade, we used butanethiol as the trigger. For
the detection of DSM, we used the thiol released from its
hydrolysis in pH 12.0 buffer at 60 οC.12 In all cases, the
cascades performed as previously reported.
As a means to generate quantitative protocols, the self-
propagating cascades were run to a set amount of time after
triggering with their analytes. The reactions were then
transferred to 96-well plates, and the plates were exposed to
UV light and photographed by an iPhone (vide infra). Further,
to prove the utility of self-propagating cascades in signal
enhancements, control experiments just containing the
fluorescence probes were carried out side-by-side with the
cascades. In addition, to prove the orthogonality of our
methodology, interference of the other nerve agent was tested
in each cascade (vide infra).
In our previous studies, a 96-well plate spectrofluorimeter
was set at a specific excitation wavelength, and emission was
recorded at a specific wavelength. The sensitivity and accuracy
from a commercially available instrument are, of course,
excellent. However, such a device is not field deployable. Thus,
we took a completely new approach, one that would replace a
conventional 96-well plate reader, be inexpensive, and could be
constructed in the field. To accomplish this, we turned to the
use of a 96-well plate reader made from LEGO, thereby

 making a dark-box (instructions for construction are given in
the Supporting Information) to image and photograph the
color of fluorescence from each well of the plate (Figure 3).
Admittedly, we could have used a 3D-printer to generate the
box. However, LEGO is a far easier medium from which to
construct such a device. First, one does not need to generate a
CAD file each time a new design is needed, and LEGO can be
reconfigured rapidly and on-the-go to suit the design needs of
the user. Lastly, LEGO can be disassembled into pieces easily
housed in a portable bag.
Thus, the dark-box was equipped with a UV/vis lamp in the
back, and a front door for placement of the 96-well plate onto
an internal guide/ramp. In addition, there are LEGO edges on
the top to guide the phone’s placement, and a hole properly
placed for the cellular phone’s camera. The box is readily
modified to accommodate any phone.
The nerve agent mimics were treated outside of the LEGO
box to release fluoride/thiols completely, and then used as
triggers for the self-propagating cascades. After signal
amplification, we added them into a 96-well plate and then
moved to the LEGO box. The well plate containing the
samples was illuminated with an attached broad-band UV
lamp, and photographs generated with an iPhone camera. The
images were then exported for computational analysis (vide
infra).
Sample Chromaticity Analysis from Photo Images.
Each well of a 96-well plate was analyzed to obtain the
reaction’s chromaticity as follows. The top of Figure 4A is a
representative image. First, we used the waterfall algorithm27 to
segment all fluorescent wells in the image. The waterfall
algorithm is a hierarchical extension of the watershed algorithm
that reduces oversegmentation. Briefly, the image is color-
inverted and converted into grayscale, such that each
fluorescent well is a dark object against a white background.
It is useful to think of pixel values as elevation and the image as
a topographic map with the wells acting as basins surrounded
by a relatively flat landscape. Intuitively, the watershed
algorithm identifies locations of the image as belonging to
the same basin whenever drops of water placed at those
locations flow toward the same minima. The waterfall
algorithm improves on this by eliminating spurious adjacent
basins that are merely parts of a larger one. After waterfall
segmentation, we perform a final filter on basins by discarding
pixels whose values deviate from background noise less than
two standard deviations. The final result is that only the large
fluorescent wells remain (Figure 4A, middle). To obtain the
most representative pixels in each for its reaction, morpho-
logical erosion26 (Figure 4A, bottom) was applied to each well
to exclude pixels near the periphery of each well: any pixel
within a certain distance of the well boundary was removed
from consideration. The color values for the representative
pixels in each well were decomposed per the CIE 1931 xyY
color space (Figure 4B)26 into the two chromaticity
components x and y and the luminosity component Y. Figure
4C plots chromaticities for pixels randomly subsampled from
each of the (eroded) calibration wells. We take the median of
all pixels from each well to be that well’s representative
chromaticity. We thus abstracted each reaction into a two-
dimensional coordinate in xy chromaticity space.
Such that anyone can reproduce this work, as well as apply
our methods to other reactions in 96-well plates, we have
uploaded our code, a sample image, and a full demonstration
of our analysis to our GitHub at https://github.com/
marcottelab/Titiwai.28 The demo notebook included can be
easily adapted to analyze new images. The details are discussed
in the Supporting Information.
To test whether the position in the plate, and therefore also
the position within the dark box, affected the chromaticity, we

 carried out an experiment using four fluorescence dyes with
different emissions, but placing them in random positions
(Figure S1). It was found that the chromaticities of each
fluorophore were independent of the position within the plate.
There are some self-correcting features of our LEGO box,
UV lamp, and iPhone device. First, because we are not using
the Y portion of the xyY color space, the luminosity (i.e.,
brightness) of the images does not matter. Thus, the gain on
the phone and the flux from the lamp are not relevant. It is
only important that the same lamp and phone is used to
generate the calibration curves and to analyze the sample. Each
different lamp would put out slightly different broad band
irradiation for excitation, and thus one expects different colors
of emission. Further, each phone has a different CCD, and
while brightness is now controllable with an iPhone, each
phone is still expected to give slightly different chromaticity.
Second, because the phone does not capture UV light, the
lamp can be kept on during the analysis, and only the color of
emission is recorded. This is different than a standard plate
reader that excites the sample, has a delay, and then reads
emission.
A crucial and very useful property of the CIE 1931 xyY color
space is that a mixture of any two light sources with differing
chromaticitiesi.e., any two points within the spectra locus of
Figure 4Bwill itself necessarily lie on the line between the
two points.26 Representative chromaticities from our calibra-
tion wells tended to be linearly distributed across all
experiments, as visually evident in Figure 4C. In this example,
the calibration wells contain increasing concentrations of DSM,
which map to a linear curve in xy chromaticity space. We
hypothesize that this linearity is a natural consequence of
ratiometric fluorescence: each of the two-fluorescent species
present in each reaction emits a particular chromaticity, and
the combined fluorescence is a mixture of these chromaticities.
Once representative chromaticities have been measured for
the calibration wells, they are used to construct a calibration
curve in chromaticity xy space. This curve is a piecewise linear
interpolation between each successive calibration chromaticity
(Figure 5). We use piecewise linear interpolation instead of a
single linear interpolation across all points because the CIE
1931 xyY color space is not uniform:26 identical color
differences in disparate regions of the color space do not
correspond to identical Euclidean distances. Color spaces
attempting uniformity have been developed; however, none of
them can entirely avoid this problem.26 Therefore, a piecewise
interpolation hedges against this error.
Once a calibration curve was constructed, it was used to
infer each reaction’s analyte concentration from its representa-
tive chromaticity (Figure 5). First, the nearest line segment of
the calibration curve to the representative chromaticity of
interest is found. The representative chromaticity is projected
to the calibration segment, and the ratio of distances to the two
nearest calibration wells is used to interpolate between them.
For example, an unknown analyte lying between two
calibration wells of 1.0 and 2.0 ppm, and being 30% of the
distance from the 1.0 ppm well is 70% × 1.0 + 30% × 2.0 = 1.3
ppm.
Photo Analysis for TBAF and DFP. Using the fluoride
self-propagating cascade introduced above, we sought to use
our chromaticity and photographic technique to quantitate
TBAF and DFP concentrations. The emission signal generated
in response to the addition of fluoride showed both an
exponential decrease at 440 nm and an increase at 500 nm.10
As can be seen from Figure 6A (inset), colors in row 2 shift
with increasing doses of TBAF triggers. The fluorometric
changes were recorded after a 10 min self-propagation in
TBME, and then diluted with an equal amount of acetonitrile
for fluorescence photo collection and color differences (blue to
yellow), which are easily detected by the naked eye. We
quantitatively analyzed these changes using the approach
described above to infer analyte concentrations (Figure 6A).
The representative chromaticities followed a linear trend in xy
space with increasing TBAF concentrations.
In an additional experiment, a linear relationship was formed
between TBAF (0−1.31 ppm) concentration and luminosity,
with R2 = 0.98 and LOD = 0.17 ppm (3σ/κ) (Figure S2B).29
However, it was observed in the luminosity that the intensity of
images triggered by targets more than 1.31 ppm reached a flat
saturation due to a longer time’s signal amplification (15 min)
and the phone’s ability to decipher brightness, but in color
space the chromaticity continues to vary in a linear manner
(Figure S2C). Thus, the concentration of samples within this
range, can still be mapped by the chromaticity segment-
method through piecewise linear interpolation. This is strong
evidence that chromaticity is more informative than luminosity
in measuring ratiometric fluorescence changes.
The control experiments that do not contain the self-
propagating cascades (row 1 Figure 6A) show minor
fluorometric changes occurring in response to TBAF, which
highlights the importance of the self-propagating system for
signal amplification. Equally important, these self-propagating
cascades displayed nearly no color alteration in response to the
addition of butanethiol (row 3 Figure 6A), which confirms the
selectivity of our protocol for fluoride over thiol derivatives
(i.e., other nucleophilic agents).
To further test the application of this photographic
technology, we monitored the fluorescence changes of the
images resulting from the self-propagating cascades in the
detection of G-type nerve agent mimic DFP, along with any
possible interference of VX nerve agent mimic DSM. We

case between calibration wells A and B. We linearly interpolate the

 employed a previously reported resin-bound oximate to
generate fluoride from aliquots of DFP,10 followed by
quantitation using the 1/BF self-propagating cascades. To
start, solutions containing different amounts of DFP were
mixed with the Wang resin-oximates in the presence of P4-t-Bu
base in TBME for 30 min, and after filtration, the filtrates were
added to the self-propagating system for a defined time and
then diluted with acetonitrile, followed by photography.
Chromaticity data show that only DFP-induced fluoride
anions led to distinct fluorometric transformation in a dose-
dependent manner (Figure 6B, row 2). By contrast, slight to no
signal change occurred in the control samples without fluoride
self-propagating cascades (Figure 6B, row 1). Additionally, the
fluoride self-propagating cascade for G-type agents did not
respond to DSM which released thiols, showing its selectivity
(Figure 6B, row 3). Likewise, luminosity data (Figure 6C)
generated a linear curve for the relationship between DFP
doses (0−2.8 ppm) and intensities in row 2 with R2 = 0.96 and
LOD = 0.46 ppm (3σ/κ), distinguishing the different amounts
of fluoride produced from DFP when triggering the
exponential fluorescence signal.
Photo Analysis for Thiol and DSM. Next, we triggered
the system containing 2 and BMEox using butanethiol for a
certain time, and then added fluorescence probe 3 for thiol
sensing. As seen in Figure 7A, samples of self-propagating
cascades in row 2 went through 20 min of self-amplification in
the presence of various amounts of butanethiol (number 1−8,
0−3.15 ppm) in pH 10.0 buffer and then were diluted with pH
7.30 PBS buffer (50% DMSO) containing probe 3. Noticeably,
there were visible color switches from blue to yellow
originating from the naphthalimide chromophore, reflecting
different accumulations of thiols after self-propagating.
We then analyzed the photos by chromaticity and luminosity
(Figure 7A and Figure S3). In the analysis of chromaticity, only
wells 1−8 in Figure 7A row 2 displayed color changes in a
linear progressive trendline, while control samples hardly
exhibit chromaticity changes due to insufficient thiol (Figure
7A, row 1) or nonreactivity toward fluoride anion (Figure 7A,
row 3). In terms of luminosity, a linear relationship exists
between butanethiol concentration and intensity, with R2 =
0.98 and LOD = 0.38 ppm (3σ/κ) (Figure S3), except that the
luminosity signal in the presence of butanethiol (2.25 ppm)
deviated from a linear curve, while the chromaticity of this
concentration stayed within the linear trendline. This again
highlights that luminosity is less reliable than chromaticity and
hence can only be adopted as a supplementary diagnosis.
To evaluate the protocol in the detection of VX nerve agent
mimic DSM, an experiment similar to the one for DFP was
carried out using our thiol amplification routine (Figure 7B).
First, aliquots of DSM (0−3.5 ppm) were stirred in an aqueous
pH 12.0 solution at elevated temperature (60 οC) to release 2-
(ethylsulfanyl)ethane-1-thiol and then incubated with the self-
propagating cascade (at pH 10.0 buffer) for 20 min. Probe 3
was then added to the samples above for fluorescence sensing
and imaging. Clear color differences can be observed in the
samples containing moieties 2, 3, and BMEox (Figure 7B, row
2), while the controls showed minor changes toward DSM and
DFP (Figure 7B, rows 1 and 3). Further, fluoride did not
initiate the self-propagating cascade, demonstrating that the
thiol cascade is selective for V-nerve agents over G-agents.
Furthermore, chromaticity of the samples in row 2 showed a
quantitative trend in the analysis of DSM, which can be
potentially applicable as calibration for identification of
unknown samples (Figure 7B, graph). As seen in Figure 7C,
a linear relationship was also formed between DSM

 concentration and luminosity in the range of 0−2.5 ppm, but
higher concentrations of DSM deviated from this trend.
We have thus demonstrated that photographic diagnostic
methods coupled with self-propagating cascades can be applied
successfully for detection of a fluoride and fluorophosphate
nerve agent mimic, as well as a thiol and thiophosphate nerve
agent mimic, respectively. We displayed the sensitivity and
selectivity of each cascade for its corresponding analyte
through photography. In both cases, chromaticity proved
more accurate and informative than luminosity (with
luminosity potentially as a supplemental source of informa-
tion). On the basis of these results, our methodology for
analyzing self-propagating cascades through fluorescence
chromaticity can be used to differentiate and quantitate G-
and V-nerve agent mimics.
Photographic Detection of Unknown Samples. Rapid
and precise detection and identification of unknown samples in
the field by a portable device is critical for medical treatment
and environmental governance. Here, we show that our
methodology can detect samples containing unknown nerve
agent mimics and, through calibration curves, also infer their
concentrations.
In Figure 8, fluoride and thiol autoamplification cascades in
samples (1−9) were incubated with standards of DFP and
DSM, respectively, across a range of concentrations near the
expected concentration of the unknown analyte to generate
calibration curves. Blind unknown samples were juxtaposed in
the same 96-well plates as the calibration standards for imaging
consistency.
Chromaticities from the calibration wells (1−9) were used
to construct calibration curves in the xy space: each curve is a
piecewise linear interpolation between each successive
calibration well’s representative chromaticities. Analyte con-
centrations for each unknown sample (a−h) was inferred by
interpolation of the standard analytes as described above. For
example, chromaticity of well c in Figure 8A is between that of
calibration wells 5 and 6, with a median Euclidean distance in
the xy space to well 5 = 0.024; to well 6 = 0.023. Color
compositions for c is thus 0.024/(0.024 + 0.023) = 58.34%
that of well 5 and 0.023/(0.024 + 0.023) = 41.65% that of well
6, resulting in [concentration of c] = 1.6 (ppm) × 58% + 2.0
(ppm) × 42% = 1.8 (ppm). The actual dose of analyte in well c
was indeed 1.8 ppm. On the basis of the same methodology, all
other wells containing unknown analytes were calculated to
output the theoretical doses of DFP or DSM added to compare
with the actual doses input as summarized in Table 1.
As noted in Table 1 and Table S1 (see Supporting
Information), the calculation of standard deviation for error
was 13%. Some of the errors are large (i.e., −26, −33, −51),
likely due to variations in the times used to stop and dilute the
reactions, because the signals from self-propagating cascades
are very sensitive to the time set for analysis. Irrespective, we
have thus demonstrated that our self-propagating cascades for
ratiometric fluorescence signal amplification interpreted via
image analysis using the CIE 1931 color space have potential
for practical applications.
■ CONCLUSION
Fluoride and thiol self-propagating cascades were successfully
employed for fluorometric signal amplification and differ-
entiation of G- and V-series nerve agent mimics: DFP and
DSM, respectively. An image analysis pipeline was developed
to perform ratiometric fluorescence sensing using common

 cellular phone images and an easily assembled field-deployable
LEGO box. Pixel chromaticities for each cascade reaction were
quantitatively mapped onto the CIE 1931 xyY color space and,
by interpolating calibration samples, were used to infer each
reaction’s analyte concentration. In essence, our device and
method replace standard 96-well plate readers. Thus, our
fluorescent self-propagating cascades and image processing
result in a very simple and efficient portable use of common
cell phones, with broad real-world field applications.

Figure 8. Fluorescence photo images; chromaticity for standard and
unknown nerve agent mimics triggered self-propagating cascades. (A,
inset) Wells 1−9 are standard samples of known DFP concentrations
(0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.0, 2.4, 2.8, 3.2 ppm). Wells a−h are unknown
samples. Fluoride self-propagating cascades were operated exactly as
in Figure 6; (B, inset) Wells 1−9 are standard samples of known DSM
concentrations (0, 0.76, 1.52, 2.28, 3.04, 3.80, 4.56, 5.32, 6.08 ppm).
Wells a−i are unknown samples. Thiol self-propagating cascades were
operated exactly as in Figure 7; (A, B, graph) Chromaticities of
randomly sampled pixels from calibration wells 1−9 are represented
as color-coded open circles. Chromaticities of randomly sampled
pixels from the unknown samples are overlaid as points.
