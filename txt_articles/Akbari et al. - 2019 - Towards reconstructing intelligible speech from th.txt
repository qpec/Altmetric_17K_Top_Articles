Auditory stimulus reconstruction is a technique that finds the best approximation of the acoustic 
stimulus from the population of evoked neural activity. Reconstructing speech from the human auditory 
cortex creates the possibility of a speech neuroprosthetic to establish a direct communication with the 
brain and has been shown to be possible in both overt and covert conditions. However, the low quality 
of the reconstructed speech has severely limited the utility of this method for brain-computer interface 
(BCI) applications. To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we combined the recent 
advances in deep learning with the latest innovations in speech synthesis technologies to reconstruct 
closed-set intelligible speech from the human auditory cortex. We investigated the dependence of 
reconstruction accuracy on linear and nonlinear (deep neural network) regression methods and the 
acoustic representation that is used as the target of reconstruction, including auditory spectrogram 
and speech synthesis parameters. In addition, we compared the reconstruction accuracy from low 
and high neural frequency ranges. Our results show that a deep neural network model that directly 
estimates the parameters of a speech synthesizer from all neural frequencies achieves the highest 
subjective and objective scores on a digit recognition task, improving the intelligibility by 65% over the 
baseline method which used linear regression to reconstruct the auditory spectrogram. These results 
demonstrate the efficacy of deep learning and speech synthesis algorithms for designing the next 
generation of speech BCI systems, which not only can restore communications for paralyzed patients 
but also have the potential to transform human-computer interaction technologies.
Auditory stimulus reconstruction is an inverse mapping technique that finds the best approximation of the acous-
tic stimulus from the population of evoked neural activity. Stimulus reconstruction was originally proposed as 
a method to study the representational properties of the neural population1–5 because this method enables the 
intuitive interpretation of the neural responses in the stimulus domain. Reconstructing speech from the neural 
responses recorded from the human auditory cortex6, however, opens up the possibility of using this technique as 
a speech brain-computer interface (BCI) to restore speech in severely paralyzed patients (for a review, see these 
references7–9). The ultimate goal of a speech neuroprosthesis is to create a direct communication pathway to the 
brain with the potential to benefit patients who have lost their ability to speak, which can result from a variety of 
clinical disorders leading to conditions such as locked-in syndrome10,11. The practicality of using speech decoding 
methods in a neuroprosthetic device to restore speech communication was further supported by studies showing 
successful decoding of speech during both overt and covert (imagined) conditions12–16. These studies showed 
successful decoding of imagined articulations13,14, imagined word repetition15, and silent reading of speech16 from 
auditory cortical areas, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG). While previous studies have established the 
feasibility of reconstructing speech from neural data, the quality of the reconstructed audio so far has been too 
low to merit subjective evaluation. For this reason, the reconstructed sounds in previous studies have been eval-
uated only using objective measures such as correlation or recognition accuracy3,6,8,13,17–25. The low quality of the 
reconstructed sound is currently a major limiting factor in actualizing speech BCI systems7.

The acoustic representation of the stimulus that is used as the decoding target can significantly impact the qual-
ity and accuracy of reconstructed sounds. Previous studies have used magnitude spectrogram (time-frequency 
representation)3,20, speech envelope21,22, spectrotemporal modulation frequencies6,13,23, and discrete units such as 
phonemes and phonetic categories8,17,24,25 and words18,19. Using discrete units can be advantageous by allowing 
for discriminative training. However, decoding discrete representations of speech such as phonemes eliminates 
the paralinguistic information such as speaker features, emotion, and intonation. In comparison, reconstructing 
continuous speech provides the possibility of real-time, continuous feedback that can be delivered to the user 
to promote coadaptation of the subject and the BCI algorithm26,27 for enhanced accuracy. A natural choice is to 
directly estimate the parameters of a speech synthesizer from neural data, but this has not been attempted previ-
ously because the process requires a highly accurate estimation of several vocoder parameters, which is hard to 
achieve with traditional machine-learning techniques.
To advance the state-of-the-art in speech neuroprosthesis, we aimed to increase the intelligibility of the recon-
structed speech by combining recent advances in deep learning28 with the latest innovations in speech synthesis 
technologies. Deep learning models have recently become the dominant technique for acoustic and audio signal 
processing29–32. These models can improve reconstruction accuracy by imposing more complete constraints on 
the reconstructed audio by better modeling the statistical properties of the speech signal3. At the same time, non-
linear regression can invert the nonlinearly encoded speech features in neural data33,34 more accurately.
We examined the effect of three factors on the reconstruction accuracy: 1) the regression technique (linear 
regression versus nonlinear deep neural network), 2) the representation of the speech intended for reconstruction 
(auditory spectrogram versus speech vocoder parameters), and 3) the neural frequency range used for regression 
(low frequency versus high-gamma envelope) (Fig. 1A). Our results showed that a deep neural network model 
that uses all neural frequencies to directly estimate the parameters of a speech vocoder achieves the highest sub-
jective and objective scores, both for intelligibility and the quality of reconstruction in a digit recognition task. 
These results represent an important step toward successful implementation of the next generation of speech BCI 
systems.

Figure 1. Schematic of the speech reconstruction method. (A) Subjects listened to natural speech sentences. 
The population of evoked neural activity in the auditory cortex of the listener was then used to reconstruct 
the speech stimulus. The responsive electrodes in an example subject are shown in red. High and low 
frequency bands were extracted from the neural data. Two types of regression models and two types of speech 
representations were used, resulting in four combinations: linear regression to auditory spectrogram (light 
blue), linear regression to vocoder (dark blue), DNN to auditory spectrogram, and DNN to vocoder (dark 
red). (B) The input to all models was a 300 ms sliding window containing both low frequency (LF) and the 
high-gamma envelope (HG). The DNN architecture consists of two modules: feature extraction and feature 
summation networks. Feature extraction for auditory spectrogram reconstruction was a fully connected neural 
network (FCN). For vocoder reconstruction, the feature extraction network consisted of an FCN concatenated 
with a locally connected network (LCN). The feature summation network is a two-layer fully connected neural 
network (FCN). (C) Vocoder parameters consist of spectral envelope, fundamental frequency (f0), voicing, 
and aperiodicity (total of 516 parameters). An autoencoder with a bottleneck layer was used to reduce the 516 
vocoder parameters to 256. The bottleneck features were then used as the target of reconstruction algorithms. 
The vocoder parameters were calculated from the reconstructed bottleneck features using the decoder part of 
the autoencoder network.

Results
Neural recordings. 
We used invasive electrocorticography (ECoG) to measure neural activity from five neu-
rosurgical patients undergoing treatment for epilepsy as they listened to continuous speech sounds. Two of the 
five subjects had high-density subdural grid electrodes implanted in the left hemisphere with coverage primarily 
over the superior temporal gyrus (STG), and four of the five subjects had depth electrodes with coverage of 
Heschl’s gyrus (HG). All subjects had self-reported normal hearing. Subjects were presented with short contin-
uous stories spoken by four speakers (two females, total duration: 30 minutes). To ensure that the subjects were 
engaged in the task, the stories were randomly paused, and the subjects were asked to repeat the last sentence.
The test data consisted of continuous speech sentences and isolated digit sounds. We used eight sentences 
(40 seconds total) to evaluate the objective quality of the reconstruction models. The sentences were repeated six 
times in random order, and the neural data was averaged over the six repetitions to reduce the effect of neural 
noise on comparison of reconstruction models (see Supp. Fig. 1 for the effect of averaging). The digit sounds 
were used for subjective intelligibility and quality assessment of reconstruction methods and were taken from a 
publicly available corpus, TI-4635. We chose 40 digit sounds (zero to nine), spoken by four speakers (two females) 
that were not included in the training of the models. Reconstructed digits were used as the test set to evaluate 
subjective intelligibility and quality of the models. Two ranges of neural frequencies were used in the study. 
Low-frequency (0–50 Hz) components of the neural data were extracted by filtering the neural signals using a 
lowpass filter. The high-gamma envelope36 was extracted by filtering the neural signals (70 to 150 Hz) and calcu-
lating the Hilbert envelope37.
Regression models. 
The input to the regression models was a sliding window over the neural data with a 
duration of 300 ms (Fig. 1B), and the hop size of 10 ms. The duration of the sliding window was chosen to max-
imize reconstruction accuracy (Supp. Fig. 2). We compared the performance of linear and nonlinear regression 
models to reconstruct the stimulus from the neural signals. The linear regression finds a linear mapping between 
the response of a population of neurons to the stimulus representation3,6. This method effectively assigns a spati-
otemporal filter to each electrode estimated by minimizing the mean-squared-error (MSE) between the original 
and reconstructed stimulus.
The nonlinear regression model was implemented using a deep neural network (DNN). We designed a deep 
neural network architecture with two stages: (1) feature extraction and (2) feature summation networks38–40 
(Fig. 1B). In this framework, a high-dimensional representation of the input (neural responses) is first calculated, 
which results in mid-level features (output of the feature extraction network). These mid-level features are then 
input to the feature summation network to regress the output of the model (acoustic representation). The feature 
summation network in all cases was a two-layer fully connected network (FCN) with regularization, dropout41, 
batch normalization42, and nonlinearity between each layer. For feature extraction, we compared the efficacy 
of five different network architectures for auditory spectrogram and vocoder reconstruction (Methods, Supp. 
Table 1 for details of each network). Specifically, we found that the fully connected network (FCN), in which 
no constraint was imposed on the connectivity of the nodes in each layer of the network to the previous layer, 
achieved the best performance for reconstructing the auditory spectrogram. However, the combination of the 
FCN and a locally connected network (LCN), which constrains the connectivity of each node to only a subset of 
nodes in the previous layer, achieved the highest performance for the vocoder representation (Supp. Tables 4, 5). 
In the combined FCN + LCN, the outputs of the two parallel networks are concatenated and used as the mid-level 
features (Fig. 1B).
Acoustic representations. 
We used two types of acoustic representation of the audio as the target for 
reconstruction: auditory spectrogram and speech vocoder. The auditory spectrogram was calculated using a 
model of the peripheral auditory system43,44, which estimates a time-frequency representation of the acoustic sig-
nal on a tonotopic frequency axis. The reconstruction of the waveform from the auditory spectrogram is achieved 
using an iterative convex optimization procedure43 because the phase of the signal is lost during this procedure.
For speech vocoder, we used a vocoder-based, high-quality speech synthesis algorithm (WORLD45), which 
synthesizes speech from four main parameters: (1) spectral envelope, (2) f0 or fundamental frequency, (3) band 
aperiodicity, and (4) a voiced-unvoiced (VUV) excitation label (Fig. 1C). These parameters are then used to 
re-synthesize the speech waveform. This model can reconstruct high-quality speech and has been shown to out-
perform other methods including STRAIGHT46. The large numbers of the parameters in the vocoder (516 total) 
and the susceptibility of the synthesis quality on inaccurate estimation of parameters however pose a challenge. 
To remedy this, we first projected the sparse vocoder parameters onto a dense subspace in which the number of 
parameters can be reduced, which allows better training with a limited amount of data. We used a dimensionality 
reduction technique that relies on an autoencoder (AEC)47 (Fig. 1C), which compresses the vocoder parameters 
into a smaller space (encoder, 256 dimensions, Supp. Table 3) and subsequently recovers (decoder) the original 
vocoder parameters from the compressed features (Fig. 1C). The compressed features (also called bottleneck 
features) are used as the target for the reconstruction network. By adding noise to the bottleneck features before 
feeding them to the decoder during training, we can make the decoder more robust to unwanted variations in 
amplitude, which is necessary due to the noise inherently present in the neural signals. The autoencoder was 
trained on 80 hours of speech using a separate speech corpus (Wall Street Journal l48). During the test phase, we 
first reconstructed the bottleneck features from the neural data, and subsequently estimated the vocoder param-
eters using the decoder part of the autoencoder (Fig. 1C). The reconstruction accuracy of individual vocoder 
parameters with a neural network shows varied improvement over the linear model, where pitch estimation is 
improved the most (%157.2), followed by aperiodicity (%18.5), spectral envelope (%6.2), and voiced-unvoiced 
parameter (%0.15, Supp. Fig. 3).

Figure 2B shows the example reconstructed auditory spectrograms from each of the four combinations of the 
regression models (linear regression and DNN) and acoustic representation (auditory spectrogram and vocoder). 
Comparison of the auditory spectrograms in Fig. 2A shows that 1) the overall frequency profile of the speech 
utterance is better preserved by the DNN compared to the linear regression model, and 2) the harmonic structure 
of speech is recovered only in the DNN-Vocoder model. These observations are shown more explicitly in Fig. 2B, 
where the magnitude power of frequency bands is shown during an unvoiced (t = 1.4 sec) and a voiced speech 
sound (t = 1.15 sec, shown with dashed lines). The frequency profile of original and reconstructed auditory spec-
trograms during the unvoiced sound shows a more accurate reconstruction of low and high frequencies for the 
DNN models (Fig. 2B left, comparison of blue and red plots). The comparison of frequency profiles during the 
voiced sound (Fig. 2B, right) reveals the recovery of speech harmonics only in the DNN-Vocoder model (com-
parison of top and bottom plots).
Subjective evaluation of the reconstruction accuracy. 
We used the reconstructed digit sounds to 
assess the subjective intelligibility and quality of the reconstructed audio. Forty unique tokens were reconstructed 
from each model, consisting of ten digits (zero to nine) that were spoken by two male and two female speakers. 
The speakers that uttered the digits were different from the speakers that were used in the training, and no digit 
sound was included in the training of the networks. We asked 11 subjects with normal hearing to listen to the 
reconstructed digits from all four models (160 tokens total) in a random order. Each digit was heard only once. 
The subjects then reported the digits (zero to nine, or uncertain), rated the reconstruction quality using the mean 
opinion score (MOS49, on a scale of 1 to 5), and reported the gender of the speaker (Fig. 3A).
Figure 3B shows the average reported intelligibility of the digits from the four reconstruction models. The 
DNN-vocoder combination achieved the best performance (75% accuracy), which is 67% higher than the 
baseline system (Linear regression with auditory spectrogram). Figure 3B also shows that the reconstructions 
using DNN models are significantly better than the linear regression models (68.5% vs. 47.5%, paired t-test, 
p < 0.001). Figure 3C shows that the subjects also rated the quality of the reconstruction significantly higher for 
the DNN-vocoder system than for the other three models (3.4 vs. 2.5, 2.3, and 2.1, unpaired t-test, p < 0.001), 
meaning that the DNN-vocoder system sounds closest to natural speech. The subjects also accurately reported 
the gender of the speaker significantly higher than chance for the DNN-vocoder system (80%, t-test, p < 0.001) 
while the performance for all other methods were at chance (Fig. 3D). The higher intelligibility and quality scores 
for the DNN-Voc system was consistently observed in all the ten listeners (Supp. Fig. 4). This result indicates the 
importance of accurate reconstruction of harmonics frequencies for identifying speaker dependent information, 
which are best captured by the DNN-Voc model.
Finally, Fig. 3E shows the confusion patterns in recognizing the digits for the four models, confirming again 
the advantage of the DNN based models, and the DNN vocoder in particular. As shown in Fig. 3E, the discri-
minant acoustic features of the digit sounds are better preserved in the DNN-Voc model, enabling the listeners 
to correctly differentiate them from the other digits. Linear regression models, however, failed to preserve these

cues, as seen by the high confusion among digit sounds. The confusion patterns also show that some errors were 
associated with the shared phonetic features, for example the confusion between digits one and nine (sharing 
‘ey’ phoneme), or four and fine (sharing the initial fricative /f/ phoneme. This result suggests a possible strategy 
for enabling accurate discrimination in BCI applications by selecting target sounds with a sufficient acoustic dis-
tance between them. The audio samples from different models can be found online50 and in the supplementary 
materials.
Objective evaluation of reconstructed audio. 
We compared the objective reconstruction accuracy of 
reconstructed audio per subject using the extended short time objective intelligibility (ESTOI)51 measure. ESTOI 
is commonly used for the intelligibility assessment of speech synthesis technologies and is calculated by meas-
uring the distortion in spectrotemporal modulation patterns of the noisy speech signal. Therefore, ESTOI score 
is sensitive to both inaccurate reconstruction of the spectral profile and the inconsistencies in the reconstructed 
temporal patterns. The ESTOI measures were calculated from continuous speech sentences in the test set. The 
average ESTOI of the reconstructed speech for all five subjects (Fig. 4A) confirms the results seen from the sub-
jective tests, which is the superiority of DNN based models over the linear model, and that of vocoder reconstruc-
tion over the auditory spectrogram (p < 0.001, t-test). This pattern was consistent for each of the five subjects in 
this study, as shown in Fig. 4B alongside the electrode locations for each subject. While the overall reconstruction 
accuracy varies significantly across subjects, which is likely due to the difference in the coverage of the auditory 
cortical areas, the relative performance of the four models was the same in all subjects. In addition, averaging the 
neural responses over multiple repetitions of the same speech utterance improved the reconstruction accuracy 
(Supp. Fig. 1) because averaging reduces the effect of neural noise.
Reconstruction accuracy from low and high neural frequencies. 
There is increasing evidence 
that the low and high-frequency bands encode different and complementary information about the stim-
ulus52. Considering that the sampling frequency of the reconstruction target is 100 Hz, we used 0–50 Hz as a 
low-frequency signal, and the envelope of high gamma (70–150 Hz) as high-frequency band information. To 
determine what frequency bands are best to include to achieve maximum reconstruction accuracy, we tested the 
reconstruction accuracy in three conditions, when the regression model uses only the high-gamma envelope, a 
low-frequency signal, or a combination of the two.
To simplify the comparison, we used only the DNN-auditory spectrogram reconstruction model. We calcu-
lated the ESTOI scores of the reconstructed speech sound using different frequency bands. We found that the 
combination of the two frequency bands significantly outperforms the reconstruction from only one of the fre-
quency bands (Fig. 5A, p < 0.001, t-test). This observation is consistent with the complementary encoding of the

stimulus features in the low and high-frequency bands53, which implicates the advantage of using the entire neu-
ral signal to achieve the best performance in speech neuroprosthesis applications when it is practically possible.
Effect of the number of electrodes and duration of training data. 
The variability of the reconstruc-
tion accuracy across subjects (Fig. 4B) suggests an important role of neural coverage in improving the recon-
struction3,6 accuracy. In addition, because some of the noise signal across different electrodes is independent, 
reconstruction from a combination of electrodes may lead to a higher accuracy by finding a signal subspace 
less affected by the noise in the data54. To examine the effect of the number of electrodes on the reconstruction 
accuracy, we first combined the electrodes of all five subjects and randomly chose N electrodes (N = 1, 2, 4, 8, 
16, 32, 64, 128), twenty times for training the individual networks. The average reconstruction accuracy for each 
N was then used for comparison. The results shown in Fig. 5B indicate that increasing the number of electrodes 
improves the reconstruction accuracy; however, the rate of improvement decreased significantly.
Finally, because the success of neural network models is largely attributed to training on large amounts of 
data28, we examined the effect of training duration on reconstruction accuracy. We used 128 randomly chosen 
electrodes and trained several neural network models each on a segment of the training data as the duration of 
the segments was gradually increased from 10 to 30 minutes. This process was performed twenty times for each 
duration by choosing a random segment of the training data, and the ESTOI score was averaged over the seg-
ments. As expected, the results show an increased reconstruction accuracy as the duration of the training was 
increased (Fig. 5C), which indicates the importance of collecting a larger duration of training data when it is 
practically feasible.
Discussion
We compared the performance of linear and nonlinear (DNN) regression models in reconstructing the auditory 
spectrogram and vocoder representation of speech signals. We found that using a deep neural network model 
to regress vocoder parameters significantly outperformed the linear regression and auditory spectrogram rep-
resentation of speech, and resulted in 75% intelligibility scores on a closed-set, digit recognition task.
Our results are consistent with those of previous reconstruction studies that showed the importance of non-
linear techniques in neural decoding55. The previous methods have used support vector machines13,56, linear 
discriminant analysis57,58, linear regression3,14,59, nonlinear embedding6, and Bayes classifiers15. In recent years, 
deep learning60 has shown tremendous success in many brain-computer interface technologies61, and our study 
extended this trend by showing the benefit of deep learning in speech neuroprosthesis research55.
We showed that the reconstruction accuracy depends on both the number of electrodes and the duration of 
the data that is available for training. This is consistent with the findings of studies showing the superior advan-
tage of deep learning models over other techniques, particularly when the amount of training data is large28. We 
showed that the rate of improvement slows down as the number of electrodes increases. This could indicate the

limited diversity of the neural responses in our recording which ultimately limits the added information that is 
gained from additional electrodes. Alternatively, increasing the number of electrodes also increases the complex-
ity and the number of free parameters in the neural network model. Because the duration of our training data was 
limited, it is possible that more training data would be needed before the benefit of additional features becomes 
apparent. Our experiments showed that increasing the amount of training data results in better reconstruction 
accuracy, therefore recording methods that can increase the amount of data available for the training of deep 
models are highly desirable, for example, when chronic recordings are possible in long-term implantable devices 
such as the NeuroPace responsive neurostimulation device (RNS)62.
We showed that the representation of the acoustic signal used as the target of reconstruction has an important 
role in the intelligibility and the quality of the reconstructed audio. We used a vocoder representation of speech, 
which extends the previous studies that used a magnitude spectrogram (time-frequency representation)3,20, 
speech envelope21,22, spectrotemporal modulation frequencies6,13,23, and discrete units such as phonemes and 
phonetic categories8,17,24,25 and words18,19. Reconstruction of the auditory spectrogram, which we also used for 
comparison, inherently results in suboptimal audio quality because the phase of the auditory spectrogram must 
be approximated. The discrete units such as phonemes enable discriminative training by learning a direct map 
from the neural data to the class labels, which is typically more efficient than generative regression models63. The 
continuous nature of parameters in acoustic reconstruction however could prove advantageous for BCI appli-
cations because they provide a continuous feedback to the user64, which is crucial for the subject and the BCI 
algorithm to coadapt to increase overall effectiveness26,27. Therefore, direct reconstruction of speech synthesis 
parameters is a natural choice. This choice however poses a challenge, since the vocoder quality is very sensitive 
to the quality of the decoding. As we have reported, reconstructing vocoder parameters resulted in both the worst 
(when used with linear regression) and the best (when used with DNN) results. Therefore, powerful modeling 
techniques such as deep learning are crucial as more inclusive representations of the speech signal are used for 
reconstruction and decoding applications. We proposed a solution to this problem by compressing the acoustic 
features into a low-dimensional space and using a decoder that is robust to the fluctuations of the input.
We found that the combination of low frequency and the envelope of high gamma results in higher recon-
struction accuracy than each frequency band alone. This finding is consistent with those of studies that have 
shown the importance of an oscillatory phase65 in addition to the neural firing rate, which is reflected in the 
high-gamma frequency band66. Combining both high and low frequencies not only enables access to the comple-
mentary information in each band52,67 but also allows the decoder to use the information that is encoded in the 
interactions between the two bands, such as cross-frequency coupling53. Overall, we observed that better brain 
coverage, more training data, and combined neural frequency bands result in the best reconstruction accuracy, 
which can serve as an upper bound performance where practical limitations prevent the use of all possible fac-
tors, for example, where the brain coverage is small, or high-frequency neural signals are not accessible such as in 
noninvasive neuroimaging methods.
The application of neural speech decoding in neuroprosthesis is contingent on the similarity of the underly-
ing neural code in overt and covert (imagined) conditions. Several previous studies have examined the gener-
alization of decoding techniques from overt to covert speech12–16 and showed the involvement of the auditory 
cortical areas, including the superior temporal gyrus (STG) in covert speech condition. Specifically, informative 
electrodes for speech decoding were found in Wernicke and the STG during imagined articulation13,14, covert 
word repetition15, and reading silently16. In addition to imagined articulation, an MEG study12 measured the 
neural activity during actual and imagined hearing conditions and compared with actual and imagined articu-
lation conditions. This study found that the neural activity during overt and covert states were more similar in 
hearing than in articulation condition. Furthermore, the similarity of the response topographies found in covert 
and overt hearing suggested a similar neural code in the two states, which is also consistent with the findings of

fMRI studies showing a similar neural substrate mediating auditory perception and imagery68–70. It is also worth 
mentioning that the activation of the auditory cortex is not specific to speech imagery, as a recent study found 
simlilar response patterns also during music perception and imagery71. While these studues have established the 
feasibility of speech decoding in covert speech perception and production, further research is needed to devise 
system architectures and training procedures that can optimally fine-tune a model to perform and generalize well 
in both overt and covert conditions. Furthermore, expanding from the closed-set intelligible speech in this work 
to continuous, open-set, natural intelligible speech requires additional research, which will undoubtedly benefit 
from a larger amount of training data, higher-resolution neural recording technologies72, and the adaptation of 
regression models73 and the subject to improve the BCI system26,27.
In summary, we present a general framework that can be used for speech neuroprothesis technologies that 
can result in accurate and intelligible reconstructed speech from the human auditory cortex. Our approach takes 
a step toward the next generation of human-computer interaction systems and more natural communication 
channels for patients suffering from paralysis and locked-in syndromes.
Materials and Methods
Participants and neural recording. 
Five patients with pharmacoresistent focal epilepsy were included 
in this study. All subjects underwent chronic intracranial encephalography (iEEG) monitoring at Northshore 
University Hospital to identify epileptogenic foci in the brain for later removal. Three subjects were implanted 
with only stereo-electroencephalographic (sEEG) depth arrays, one with a high-density grid, and one with both 
grid and depth electrodes (PMT, Chanhassen, MN, USA). The electrodes showing any sign of abnormal epi-
leptiform discharges, as identified in the epileptologists’ clinical reports, were excluded from the analysis. All 
included iEEG time series were manually inspected for signal quality and were free from interictal spikes. All 
research protocols were approved and monitored by the institutional review board at the Feinstein Institute for 
Medical Research, and informed written consent to participate in the research studies was obtained from each 
subject before electrode implantation. All research was performed in accordance with relevant guidelines and 
regulations.
Intracranial EEG (iEEG) signals were acquired continuously at 3 kHz per channel (16-bit precision, 
range ± 8 mV, DC) using a data acquisition module (Tucker-Davis Technologies, Alachua, FL, USA). Either sub-
dural or skull electrodes were used as references, as dictated by recording quality at the bedside after online 
visualization of the spectrogram of the signal. Speech signals were recorded simultaneously with the iEEG for 
subsequent offline analysis. Two ranges of neural frequencies were used in the study. Low-frequency (0–50 Hz) 
components of the neural data were extracted by filtering the neural signals using an FIR lowpass filter. The 
high-gamma (70–150 Hz) envelope36 was extracted by first filtering the data into eight frequency bands between 
70 and 150 Hz using IIR filters. The envelope of each band was then obtained using a Hilbert transform. We took 
the average of envelopes in all frequency bands as the total envelope which was then resampled to 100 Hz. The 
high-gamma responses were normalized based on the responses recorded during a 2-minute silence interval 
before each recording.
Brain maps. 
The electrode positions were mapped to brain anatomy using registration of the post-implant 
computed tomography (CT) to the pre-implant MRI via the post-op MRI74. After coregistration, the elec-
trodes were identified on the post-implantation CT scan using BioImage Suite75. Following coregistration, 
the subdural grid and strip electrodes were snapped to the closest point on the reconstructed brain surface of 
the pre-implantation MRI. We used the FreeSurfer automated cortical parcellation76 to identify the anatomi-
cal regions in which each electrode contact was located within approximately 3 mm resolution (the maximum 
parcellation error of a given electrode to a parcellated area was <5 voxels/mm). We used Destrieux’s parcella-
tion because it provides higher specificity in the ventral and lateral aspects of the medial lobe77. The automated 
parcellation results for each electrode were closely inspected by a neurosurgeon using the patient’s coregistered 
post-implant MRI.
Stimulus. 
The speech materials included continuous speech stories recorded in-house by four voice actors 
and actresses (duration: 30 min, 11,025 Hz sampling rate). Eight of the sentences (40 seconds) were used for objec-
tive tests and were presented to the patients eight times to improve the signal to noise ratio. The digit sounds were 
taken from the TI-46 corpus35. Two female (f2 and f8) and two male (m2 and m5) speakers were chosen from 
the corpus, and one token per digit and speaker was used (total of 40 unique tokens). Each digit was repeated six 
times to improve the signal to noise ratio of the neural responses. The speakers that uttered the digits were differ-
ent from the speakers that narrated the stories.
Acoustic representation. 
The auditory spectrogram representation of speech was calculated from a model 
of the peripheral auditory system78. The model consists of three stages: 1) a cochlear filter bank consisting of 128 
constant-Q filters equally spaced on a logarithmic axis, 2) a hair cell stage consisting of a low-pass filter and a non-
linear compression function, and 3) a lateral inhibitory network, consisting of a first-order derivative along the 
spectral axis. Finally, the envelope of each frequency band was calculated to obtain a time-frequency representa-
tion simulating the pattern of activity on the auditory nerve78. The final auditory spectrogram has a sampling 
frequency of 100 Hz. The audio signal was reconstructed from the auditory spectrogram using an iterative convex 
optimization procedure43. For the vocoder-based speech synthesizer, we used the WORLD45 (D4C edition) sys-
tem. In this model, four major speech parameters were estimated, from which the speech waveform was syn-
thesized: (1) spectral envelope, (2) f0 or fundamental frequency, (3) band aperiodicity, and (4) voiced-unvoiced 
(VUV) excitation label. The dimension of each parameter was automatically calculated by the vocoder method 
and was based on the window size and the sampling frequency of the waveform (16 KHz).

DNN architecture. 
We used a common deep neural network architecture that consists of two stages: feature 
extraction and feature summation38–40 (Fig. 2A). In this framework, a high-dimensional representation of the 
input is first calculated (feature extraction), which is then used to regress the output of the model (feature summa-
tion). The feature summation and feature extraction networks are optimized jointly together during the training 
phase. In all models examined, the feature summation step consisted of a two-layer fully connected network 
(FCN) with L2 regularization, dropout41, batch normalization42, and nonlinearity in each layer.
We study five different architectures for the feature extraction part of the network: the fully connected network 
(FCN, also known as the multilayer perceptron or MLP), the locally connected network (LCN)79, convolutional 
neural network (CNN)80, FCN + CNN, and FCN + LCN (for details of each architecture see Supp. Table 1). In 
the combined networks, we concatenated the output of two parallel paths, which were fed into the summation 
network. For FCN, the windowed neural responses were flattened and fed to a multilayer FCN. However, in LCN 
and CNN, all the extracted features were of the same size as the input, meaning that we did not use flattening, 
strided convolution, or downsampling prior to the input layer or between the two consecutive layers. Instead, the 
final output of the multilayer LCN or CNN was flattened prior to feeding the output into the feature summation 
network.
The optimal network structure was found separately for the auditory spectrogram and vocoder parameters 
using an ablation study. For auditory spectrogram reconstruction, we directly regressed the 128 frequency bands 
using a multilayer FCN model for feature extraction (Supp. Table 5). This architecture, however, was not plausible 
for reconstructing vocoder parameters due to the high-dimensionality and statistical variability of the vocoder 
parameters. To remedy this, we used a deep autoencoder network (AEC)47 to find a compact representation of 
the 516-dimensional vocoder parameters (consisting of 513 spectral envelopes, pitch, voiced-unvoiced, and band 
periodicity)45. We confirmed that decoding the AEC features performed significantly better than decoding the 
vocoder parameters directly (Supp. Table 2). The structure for the proposed deep AEC is illustrated in Fig. 2D. 
To carry out decoding, we used a multilayer FCN, in which the number of the nodes changed in a descending 
(encoder) and then ascending order (decoder) (Fig. 2C)(Supp. Table 6). The bottleneck layer of such a network 
(or the output of the encoder part of the pre-trained AEC) can be used as a low-dimensional reconstruction target 
by employing the neural network model, from which the vocoder parameters can be estimated using the decoder 
part of the AEC. We chose the number of nodes in the bottleneck layer to be 256, because it maximized both the 
objective reconstruction accuracy (Supp. Table 3), and the subjective assessment of the reconstructed sound. To 
increase the robustness to unwanted variations in the encoded features, we used two methods in the bottleneck 
layer: (1) the hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) was used as a nonlinearity to control the range of the encoded 
features, and (2) Gaussian noise was added during training prior to feeding into the first layer of the decoder part 
to make the decoder robust enough to unwanted changes in amplitude resulting from noises in neural responses. 
We confirmed that using additive Gaussian noise in the bottleneck instead of dropout performed significantly 
better (paired t-test, p < 0.001). It is important that we use the same nonlinearity as the bottleneck (tanh) in the 
output of the main network, since the estimations should be in the same range and space as those in which they 
were originally coded. The best network architecture for decoding the vocoder parameters was found to be the 
FCN + LCN network (Supp. Table 4).
DNN training and cross validation. 
The networks were implemented in Keras with a Tensorflow back-
end81. Initialization of the weights was performed using a previously proposed method which was specifically 
developed for deep multilayer networks with rectified linear units (ReLUs) as their nonlinearities82. It has been 
shown that using this method helps such networks converge faster. We used batch normalization42, nonlinearity, 
and a dropout of p = 0.341 between each layer. We applied an L2 penalty (with a multiplier weight set to 0.001) on 
the weights of all the layers in all types of networks (including the AEC). However, we found that using additive 
Gaussian noise in the bottleneck of the AEC instead of dropout and regularization performed significantly better 
(paired t-test, p < 0.001). We used three types of nonlinearities in the networks: (1) LeakyReLU83 for all layers of 
AEC except the bottleneck and for all layers of the feature extraction part of the main network, (2) tanh for the 
output layer of the main network and the bottleneck of the AEC, and (3) the exponential linear unit (ELU)84 for 
the feature summation network. Each epoch of training had a batch size of 256, and optimization was performed 
using Adam85 with an initial learning rate of 0.0001, which was reduced by a factor of two if the validation loss 
did not improve in four consecutive epochs. Network training was achieved in 150 epochs and was performed 
for each subject separately. The loss function was a combination of MSE and Pearson’s correlation coefficient for 
each sample:

in which y is the actual label (auditory spectrogram or vocoder features) for that sample and ˆ
y is the reconstruc-
tion from the output layer of the network. The maximum time-lag used was τ
max = 30 ms (Supp. Fig. 2). Because 
of the higher correlated activity between the neural responses of neighboring electrodes86, it was important to 
ensure that the networks can model the local structure in the data. Because both CNN and LCN use small recep-
tive fields that take local patterns into account, we retained the spatial organization of the electrode sites in the 
input to the network, meaning that the electrodes that were close to each other in the brain were arranged to be 
close together in the input data matrix.
Cross validation. 
We trained both the LR model and the DNN models using cross validation. We used the 
speech stories for training all models, and used repeated sentences (separate set from the stories) and digit sounds

for testing. No digit sound was included in the training, and the speakers that uttered the digits were different 
from those that read the stories. The autoencoder network (AEC) was trained on a separate speech corpus (Wall 
Street Journal, WSJ, 80 hours of read speech)48.
Subjective and objective evaluations. 
We assessed the intelligibility of the reconstructed speech using 
both subjective and objective tests. For subjective assessment, 11 participants with self-reported normal hearing 
listened to the reconstructed digits using headphones in a quiet environment. Each participant listened to 160 
tokens including 10 digits, four speakers, and four models. The participants were asked to report the digit or to 
select unsure if the digit was not intelligible. In addition, the participants reported the quality of the reconstructed 
speech using a mean opinion score (MOS): 1 (bad), 2 (poor), 3 (fair), 4 (good), and 5 (excellent). The participants 
also reported the gender of the speaker. For objective evaluation, we used the ESTOI measure51 which is a monau-
ral intelligibility prediction algorithm commonly used in speech enhancement and synthesis research. The range 
of ESTOI measure is between zero (worst) and one (best).
