Objective: To examine the hypothesis that autism spectrum disorders (ASD) diagnosis and traits in childhood are associated with suicidal thoughts,
plans and self-harm at 16 years, and that any observed associations are explained by depression at 12 years.
Method: We examined associations between ASD diagnosis and 4 dichotomized ASD traits (social communication, pragmatic language, repetitive
behavior, and sociability) with suicidal and nonsuicidal self-harm, suicidal thoughts, and suicidal plans at age 16 years in 5,031 members of the United
Kingdom�based birth cohort study the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. We assessed whether any associations were explained by
depressive symptoms in early adolescence measured by the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire at 12 years.
Results: Children with impaired social communication had a higher risk of self-harm with suicidal intent (relative risk [RR] ¼ 2.14, 95% CI ¼ 1.28–
3.58), suicidal thoughts (RR ¼ 1.42, 95% CI ¼ 1.06–1.91), and suicidal plans (RR ¼ 1.95, 95% CI ¼ 1.09–3.47) by age 16 years as compared to
those without. There was no evidence for an association between ASD diagnosis and outcomes, although these analyses were imprecise because of small
numbers. There was also no evidence of an association between other autism traits and the outcomes. Approximately 32% of the total estimated
association between social communication impairment and self-harm was explained by depressive symptoms at 12 years.
Conclusion: Social communication impairments are an important autistic trait in relation to suicidality. Early identification and management of
depression may be a preventative mechanism, and future research identifying other potentially modifiable mechanisms may lead to interventions against
suicidal behavior in this high-risk group.

utism spectrum disorders (ASD) are developmental disor-
ders characterized by deficits in social interaction and
communication, restricted range of interests, and repetitive
behaviors.1 An increase in premature mortality in this population has
been recently reported, with suicide being suggested as a significant
contributor.2 However, there is a lack of population-based research on
suicidal behavior and suicidal ideation in this population.3 Suicidal
behavior describes self-harm (with or without suicidal intent) and
completed suicide, whereas suicidal ideation refers to suicidal thoughts
and cognitions.3 Self-harm and suicidal behavior are highly prevalent in
young people,4 and self-harming behaviors are a strong risk factor for
completed suicide.5
The possibility of higher rates of suicidal ideation and attempts in
individuals with ASD has been reported6,7; however, the existing research
has focused mostly on either case reports8 or cross-sectional studies car-
ried out in clinical7,9 and nonclinical10 settings. The cross-sectional
design,7,9,10 selective nature of the samples,7 and lack of an adequate
comparison group9 increase the likelihood of selection bias and limit the
generalizability of these findings. There remains a lack of longitudinal
research using large population-based samples while accounting for
possible confounding factors and reducing the possibility of selection and
recall bias. It is also important to distinguish between self-harm with and
without suicidal intent, as these, although related, are clinically distinct
outcomes.11 In addition, a growing body of research argues that the
social, communication, and behavioral difficulties comprising the autism
spectrum may have distinct etiologies,12 and it is plausible that outcomes
related to difficulties in individual autistic traits may also differ. To our
knowledge, there have been no prospective cohort studies examining the
association between autistic traits and suicidal behavior and ideation.
Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying any associations between
autism/autistic traits and suicidality have not been examined. For
example, depression is a strong risk factor for suicidal ideation and self-
harm in the general population13; however, whether it could explain a
greater risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in people with autism has
not been studied. Quantifying this relationship is important, as it may
inform preventive or intervention strategies, considering that depression
is potentially treatable. We used prospectively collected data from the
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a large
birth cohort in Bristol, UK, to address some of these gaps in the litera-
ture. Our research questions were: as follows: (1) Is an autism diagnosis

 and/or are autistic traits associated with suicidal ideation (suicidal
thoughts and plans) and suicidal behavior (self-harm with and without
suicidal intent) by age 16 years? (2) Are any of the observed associations
explained by depressive symptoms in early adolescence?
METHOD
Participants
The sample comprised participants from the Avon Longitudinal Study of
Parents and Children (ALSPAC). During phase I enrollment, a total of
14,541 pregnant mothers residing in the former Avon Health Authority in
the southwestern part of England with expected dates of delivery between
April 1, 1991, and December 31, 1992, were recruited. These pregnancies
resulted in 14,062 live births, and 13,988 children were alive at 1 year of age.
When the oldest children were approximately 7 years of age, an attempt was
made to bolster the initial sample with eligible case individuals who had
failedtojoin the study originally. The total samplesizefor analyses using data
after the age of 7 years is 15,247 pregnancies, of which 14,701 children were
alive at 1 year of age. Ethical approval for the data collection was obtained
fromthe ALSPACEthicsand Law Committee and the Local ResearchEthics
Committees. Detailed information about the cohort has been collected since
early pregnancy, including regular self-completion questionnaires from
mothers and children. Information about ALSPAC is available at www.
bristol.ac.uk/alspac/, including a searchable data dictionary (http://www.
bris.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/data-access/data-dictionary/). Further details
on the cohort profile, representativeness, and phases of recruitment are
provided by Boyd et al.14 and Fraser et al.15
Measures
ASD Diagnosis and Autistic Traits. Identification of children diagnosed
with ASD in ALSPAC has been described in detail elsewhere.16,17 Briefly,
a multisource approach included a record linkage study identifying cases
from the following: community pediatric records; autism as the main
reason for special educational needs from school records; maternal reports
at age 9 years that the child had been diagnosed with “an autistic spec-
trum disorder or Asperger syndrome”; free text questionnaire responses
from 6 months to 11 years; and ad hoc letters from parents to the Study
Director.16 The diagnosis of ASD in ALSPAC has been previously
validated by a consultant pediatrician using the International Classifica-
tion of Diseases (ICD-10),16 and we have cross validated cases ascertained
from maternal reports against autistic spectrum traits.17
Four individual measures optimally predictive of autism diagnosis in
ALSPAC18 via parental questionnaires were analyzed. These included the
following: the Social and Communication Disorder Checklist (assessed at
91 months); a measure of repetitive behavior (assessed at 69 months); the
sociability subscale of the Emotionality, Activity and Sociability Temper-
ament Scale (assessed at 38 months); and the coherence subscale of the
Children’s Communication Checklist (assessed at 115 months) (see Steer
et al.18 for description of measures). Consistent with previous research
using the ALSPAC data, each ASD trait was dichotomized to create the
high-risk group (forASD) of as close aspossible to 10%of the population.17
Self-Harm and Suicidal Thoughts and Plans. Self-harm questions were
based on those used in the Child and Adolescent Self-Harm in Europe
Study (CASE).4 Participants who responded positively to the question
“Have you ever hurt yourself on purpose in any way (e.g., by taking an
overdose of pills or by cutting yourself?)” at 16 years were classified as
having a lifetime history of self-harm. Responses to 2 additional questions
were used to identify those who self-harmed with suicidal intent: (1)
selecting the response option “I wanted to die” in response to the question
“Do any of the following reasons help to explain why you hurt yourself on
that (i.e., the most recent), occasion?” or (2) a positive response to the
question “On any of the occasions when you have hurt yourself on purpose,
have you ever seriously wanted to kill yourself?” These questions helped to
identify individuals who had harmed with suicidal intent at some point
during their lifetime, and those who had only ever engaged in nonsuicidal
self-harm. Self-harm behaviors were classified according to individual’s self-
reported suicidal intent.19
Lifetime history of suicidal thoughts and plans were also assessed
with the following questions at 16 years: “Have you ever thought of
killing yourself, even if you would not really do it?” and “Have you ever
made plans to kill yourself?”
Mediating Variable. To examine whether depressive symptoms in early
adolescence mediate the association between childhood ASD and suicidal
behavior in late adolescence, we used data from the Short Mood and
Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ), a 13-item instrument used to evaluate
core depressive symptomatology in children and adolescents 8 to 18 years
of age,20 assessed at 12 years. The SMFQ correlates highly with more
extensive depression diagnostic tool such the Diagnostic Interview
Schedule for Children.21
Confounding Variables. Parental, socioeconomic, and family character-
istics identified in previous studies as being associated with ASD and
suicidal behavior were collected prospectively from maternal question-
naires during the antenatal period. These included the following: finan-
cial problems (occurrence of major financial problems since pregnancy
versus none); highest maternal educational attainment (minimal educa-
tion or none, compulsory secondary level, up to age 16 years); non-
compulsory secondary level (up to age 18 years) versus university level
education); parental social class (professional/managerial versus manual),
with the highest of maternal or paternal social class used; and accom-
modation type (detached house or semidetached house versus a flat/
apartment); maternal age (in years); maternal antenatal (18 and 32 weeks’
gestation) and early postnatal (8 weeks and 8 months) depression assessed
using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS); maternal
antenatal anxiety (18 and 32 weeks’ gestation) measured using anxiety
items from the Crown-Crisp Index, a validated self-rating inventory;
parental suicide attempt assessed using maternal questionnaires repeated
8 times from birth to 11 years (yes or no); sexual abuse (repeated 7 times
from birth to 8 years) and physical cruelty (repeated 8 times from birth to
11 years) to children in the household by mother/partner (yes or no).
Analyses were also adjusted for child’s sex (male versus female) and
ethnicity (white versus nonwhite).
Statistical Analyses
Main Effects. First, we compared characteristics of children in the study
with missing data with those who comprised the study sample and carried
out descriptive analysis. In the main analysis, we used multinomial
regression to examine associations with explanatory variables and a 3-
category self-harm outcome: no self-harm; self-harm without suicidal
intent; and self-harm with suicidal intent at 16 years. We used modified
Poisson regression to examine the associations between explanatory vari-
ables and suicidal thoughts and plans at 16 years as binary outcomes to
derive relative risks and robust 95% confidence intervals. A modified
Poisson regression approach (with a robust error variance) directly esti-
mates relative risks and robust error estimates with binary outcomes.22 We
tested models unadjusted and adjusted for the potential confounding
factors. In accordance with ALSPAC policy to protect confidentiality,
analyses in which the number of participants was less than 5 in a given cell

 were censored. All analyses were conducted using Stata v.13 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX).
Mediating Effects. We wanted to assess the importance of depressive
symptoms at age 12 years in explaining the association between autistic
traits in childhood and self-harm at age 16 years. Direct pathways (ASD
to risk of self-harm) and indirect pathways (through depressive symp-
toms) were estimated using structural equation modeling in Mplus v.7.
Confirmatory factor analysis was used to derive a normally distributed
latent trait underlying the observed SMFQ20 scores using ordinal
response items. A latent trait approach helps account for measurement
error and increases power by modeling variables as a continuous trait.23
The approach recommended by Muth�
en (unpublished manuscript,
October 28, 2011; available online https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/776
d/2df784e67ab691bbffc280d3f4a480740300.pdf) was used to estimate
mediation effects within the context of possible confounding. Analyses
were adjusted for a range of individual, maternal, and familial con-
founders. A detailed description of the mediation method is presented in
Supplement 1, available online.
Missing Data. Similar to all longitudinal birth cohort studies with long-
term follow-up, attrition is a well-known problem in ALSPAC. Thus, all
missing data were imputed, and all analyses were repeated using data for
n ¼ 5,093 (main effects) and n ¼ 7,788 (mediation) adolescents. We
imputed for missing data because ignoring those cases with missing data
can result in bias by making the assumption that data are missing
completely at random.24 A complete description of the imputation
method is presented in Supplement 2, available online.
RESULTS
Sample Derivation
Our starting sample included those individuals with data on at least one
ASD exposure (presence/absence of ASD diagnosis or data on at least one of
the 4 dichotomized ASD traits; n ¼ 14,684). The number of adolescents
with complete data on depressive symptoms at age 12 years was 6,680.
Complete outcome data on suicidal behavior and ideation at age 16 years
were available for 5,031 adolescents. The numbers of participants available
with data on suicidal behavior and ideation at 16 years, childhood ASD
exposures, and confounders are shown in Figure 1. Descriptive statistics of
the sample by the presence of autism/autistic traits are presented in
Table S1, available online. Characteristics of the sample by the
completeness of data availability are presented in Table S2, available online.
Main Effects
Of 5,031 adolescents with data on suicidal behavior and ideation up to
age 16 years, 602 (11.9%, 95% CI ¼ 11.0–12.8%) reported self-harm

 without suicidal intent, 347 (6.9%, 95% CI ¼ 6.2%–7.6%) reported
self-harming with suicidal intent, 797 (15.7%, 95% CI ¼ 14.6–16.4)
reported experiencing suicidal thoughts, and 227 (4.5%, 95% CI ¼ 3.8–
5.0) reported making suicidal plans (Tables 1 and 2). The regression
analysis (Table 3) provided evidence for an effect of impaired social
communication on risk of self-harm with suicidal intent (adjusted relative
risk [RR] ¼ 2.14, 95% CI ¼ 1.28–3.58, p ¼ .004), but not self-harm
without suicidal intent (adjusted RR ¼ 1.02, 95% CI ¼ 0.62–1.67,
p ¼ .943). There was also evidence for an effect of impaired social
communication on risk of suicidal thoughts (adjusted RR ¼ 1.42, 95%
CI ¼ 1.06–1.91, p ¼ .019) and suicidal plans (adjusted RR ¼ 1.95, 95%
CI ¼ 1.09–3.47, p ¼ .024) (Table 4). There was no evidence of an
association between ASD diagnosis and any of the outcomes, although
the numbers were very low and confidence intervals wide. None of the
other autistic traits (sociability, coherence, and repetitive behavior)
appeared to be associated with the outcomes (Tables 3 and 4).
Results were comparable when using imputed data sets for the
main effect of impaired social communication on the outcomes

 (see Tables S3–S5, available online). In these imputed analyses, there
was evidence for the main effect of repetitive behavior and reduced
coherence on risk of self-harm with suicidal intent (relative risk [RR] ¼
1.58, 95% CI ¼ 1.00–2.48, p ¼ .049, and RR ¼ 1.97, 95%
CI ¼ 1.36–2.81, p < .001 respectively), and suicidal plans (RR ¼ 1.63,
95% CI ¼ 1.03–2.58, p ¼ .035, and RR ¼ 1.61, 95% CI ¼
1.08–2.41, p ¼ .019 respectively).
Mediation Effects
Given the main effect of impaired social communication on risk of self-
harm, we examined whether depressive symptoms in early adolescence
mediate this association. To estimate the mediation model, we combined
suicidal/nonsuicidal self-harm into one category. First, we examined the
fit of the measurement model incorporating exposure, mediator, and
confounders. The full model was run without using bootstrapping to
enable calculation of model fit statistics. The root mean square error of
approximation (RMSEA) of 0.04 (95% CI ¼ 0.03–0.04) and the
comparative fit index (CFI) of 0.97 indicated that the measurement
model fit the data well, supporting the adequacy of the model for tests of
structural paths and mediation effects (Figure 2). We estimated unad-
justed and adjusted structural mediation models to examine the direct
and indirect effects of impaired social cognition on self-harm through
depressive symptoms while accounting for possible mediator�outcome
confounding. Mediation models were adjusted for child (sex), socioeco-
nomic (maternal educational attainment), maternal (antenatal anxiety),
and familial (parental suicidal attempt) characteristics that had statistical
evidence of association with exposure and outcome in the main effects
analyses. There was evidence of an indirect pathway from impaired social
cognition to self-harm via depressive symptoms (unadjusted product
coefficient [b] ¼ 0.087, 95% CI ¼ 0.03–0.14, p ¼ .002). There was no
evidence of a direct pathway from impaired social cognition to self-harm

 once the indirect effect via depressive symptoms was accounted for
(unadjusted regression coefficient [b] ¼ 0.090, 95% CI ¼ �0.11 to
0.28, p ¼ .372). This indirect pathway via depressive symptoms
accounted for 32% of the total estimated association between impaired
social cognition and self-harm. Adjustment for the confounders made
little difference to the parameter estimates (Table 5).
The direct and indirect estimates with imputed data sets led to
similar results (see Table S5, available online). However, the sizes of the
observed direct and indirect effects were greater, which may suggest
that attrition led to an underestimation of the direct and indirect effect
sizes in the complete case analyses. Based on the imputed analyses, a
slightly higher proportion (35%) of the total association between
impaired social cognition and self-harm was accounted for by the in-
direct path through depressive symptoms (see Supplement 3, available
online).
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first large population-based study to
investigate the association between an autism diagnosis and traits and
suicidal ideation and behavior by late adolescence, as well as examining
the mechanisms of this association. We did not find an association with
diagnosed autism and the outcomes, although the estimates were
imprecise because of small numbers. Impairments in social communi-
cation were associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, suicidal
plans, and self-harm with suicidal intent, but not self-harm without
suicidal intent.
Our findings suggest that social communication difficulties may be
important in relation to suicidality. Our findings are consistent with
existing case studies suggesting that social impairments and difficulties in
establishing interpersonal relationships are triggers for suicidal behavior.25
Suicidal behavior in individuals with autism is often underreported,26
particularly in those with impaired communicative abilities and comor-
bid self-injurious behavior.27 Our findings emphasize the potential
importance of assessing whether self-injurious behavior occurs in the
context of suicidal ideation.3 The stronger associations for social
communication with suicidality outcomes as compared to the other traits
of autism is concordant with the argument on the fractionation of core
autistic impairments.12 However, it is important to note that although
difficulties in social communication are a key impairment in autism, they
could also be observed in other conditions, and may be a problem in their
own right. Thus, impairments in social communication may also be
considered a trait associated with higher suicidality, inside or outside of
the context of ASD.

 It has been argued that it is adolescents with ASD without intellectual
disability who are at most risk of suicidal ideation and behaviour,28 because
of the increased awareness of their social difficulties and secondary
depression associated with social isolation and exclusion.7 We were not able
to directly test this possibility, as participants in our sample were pre-
dominantly high-functioning individuals (96.4% of individuals with
autism diagnosis had an IQ of >70), and we did not have enough statistical
power to study lower- and higher-functioning individuals separately.
We tested whether depression during early adolescence could
explain the association between social communication and suicidal
behavior. Children with impaired social communication skills were at
increased risk for depressive symptoms in early adolescence, which, in
turn, was a strong risk factor for suicidal behavior later in adolescence. It
should be noted that although depression explained about a third of the
variance of the association between childhood autistic traits and suicidal
behavior, substantial variance remained unexplained. This finding em-
phasises the need for identifying other individual and environmental,
potentially modifiable mechanisms (e.g., anxiety, peer victimization/
bullying) in this relationship.
The strengths of this study include the large sample, the long-term
follow-up, the availability of data on several outcomes, as well as rich data
on confounders, and a longitudinal design that permits an examination of
mediating pathways. Furthermore, we were able to examine a range of
autistic traits in a large population,3 despite a relatively small number of
cases with an ASD diagnosis. The findings need to be interpreted in light
of several limitations. First, our study was likely to be underpowered to
detect the association between ASD diagnosis and the outcomes because
of a relatively small number of diagnosed cases followed up until age 16
years. Second, despite the population-based sample, it is not possible to
rule out selection bias in relation to baseline recruitment or attrition in
the sample over time. We attempted to address this by controlling for
factors known to be predictive of attrition in ALSPAC and by imputing
missing data. The pattern of missing data and imputed analyses suggests
that attrition may have led to an underestimation of the size of the as-
sociation between ASD traits, in particular repetitive behavior and
impaired speech coherence, and suicidal ideation and behavior. Third,
there are limitations in establishing suicidal intent accompanying
self-harm, particularly using self-reports, which could be influenced by
fluctuations in mood or change over time. This could be further com-
pounded in individuals with autistic features, who may experience
additional difficulties understanding or responding to such question-
naires. These difficulties in expressing emotions and possible lack of
verbal skills to communicate thoughts may also make the diagnosis of
suicidal ideation problematic, necessitating adjustments to existing clin-
ical diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches.29
In summary, this study suggests that children with impairments in
social communication are at higher risk for suicidal ideation and behavior
in late adolescence. Depressive symptoms in early adolescence partially
explain this association, which emphasizes the importance of addressing
the mental health needs of children with autism. Future research is
required to assess whether other modifiable mechanisms could be iden-
tified, as these may have the potential to lead to preventive action or
interventions against suicidal behavior in this high-risk group.

 SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIAL
SUPPLEMENT 1
Method: Mediation Effects
We examined whether depressive symptoms in early adolescence may be
a possible mediating mechanism in the association between childhood
autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and suicidal ideation and behavior in
adolescence. We hypothesized that childhood ASD would be associated
with higher risk of depressive symptoms in early adolescence (12 years),
and that this would constitute an indirect pathway between ASD and
increased risk of self-harm with and without suicidal intent at 16 years.
We used structural equation modeling to test this hypothesis, using a
latent factor to encapsulate the continuum nature of depressive
symptoms and by adjusting our analyses for a range of individual,
maternal, and familial confounders. To improve causal inferences
strongly advocated by recent methodological advancements in statistical
techniques
to
assess
mediation,1
we
used
mediation
approach
recommended by Muth�
en (unpublished manuscript, October 28,
2011; available online https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/776d/2df784e67
ab691bbffc280d3f4a480740300.pdf)
to
estimate
mediation
effects
within the context of possible confounding. In line with a causal
mediation framework,2 we assumed the following: (1) no unmeasured
confounding of the exposure�outcome association; (2) no unmeasured
confounding of the mediator�outcome association; (3) no unmeasured
confounding
of
the
exposure�mediator
association;
and
(4)
no
mediator�outcome confounder affected by exposure. The “Model
Constraint” command was used to derive new parameters and standard
errors representing causally defined direct and indirect (mediated)
effects.3 (For a detailed description and MPlus input syntax, see
Muth�
en, unpublished manuscript, cited above). A weighted least-
squares estimator was used because of its robustness in estimating both
continuous
and
categorical
variables.4
First,
we
estimated
the
unadjusted mediation model that included only exposure, mediator,
and outcome. Second, we estimated the model adjusted for child and
maternal
characteristics,
as
well
as
indices
of
socioeconomic
disadvantage. All confounders were modeled as binary indicators.
Given the nature and timing of the confounders, we assumed no
further intermediate confounding. Indirect effects and associated 95%
confidence intervals were calculated using bias-corrected bootstrapping
(500 replications) to account for the nonnormal distribution of the
indirect effect.5
SUPPLEMENT 2
Method: Multiple Imputation for Missing Data
We accounted for the loss to follow-up by repeating primary (n ¼ 5,093)
and mediation (n ¼ 7,788) analyses on an imputed dataset comprising
those participants with complete data on at least one exposure, one
outcome, and mediator. We used multivariable imputation by chained
equations (MICE)6 to impute missing data using the ice command in
Stata version 13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). The availability of
rich, prospectively collected data on a range of sociodemographic
variables in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) enables one to account for confounders and factors that
explain missingness, thus, supporting the missing-at-random (MAR)
assumption.7 A total of 70 imputed datasets by 10 cycles of regression
were generated. Each imputation model used all variables in the sub-
stantive analyses, along with more than 30 auxiliary variables (full list
available upon request) relating to sociodemographic adversity and
maternal and child psychopathology that have been identified as strong
predictors of missingness in the confounders and the mediator. Monte
Carlo errors were less than 10% of the standard error, and the Fraction of
Missing Information values were no larger than 0.7, suggesting that 70
datasets were sufficient.8 The primary analysis was repeated by averaging
parameter estimates over the imputed datasets and computing the asso-
ciated standard error using Rubin’s rule.9 Standard errors and 95%
confidence intervals for direct and indirect effects in the mediation
analysis performed on the imputed dataset were estimated using boot-
strapping (500 samples) methodology.10
SUPPLEMENT 3
Results: Missing Data: Sensitivity Analyses
The results from analyses with imputed data supported our substantive
findings, providing further evidence to support the association between
impaired social communication skills in early childhood and risk of self-
harm with suicidal intent, suicidal thoughts, and plans in late adoles-
cence. In contrast to the complete case analysis, there was also evidence
for the main effect of repetitive behavior and reduced speech coherence
on risk of self-harm with suicidal intent and suicidal plans (Tables S3 and
S4). In the mediation models, the direct and indirect effect estimates were
in the same direction and led to the same overarching conclusions
(Table S5). However, the sizes of the observed direct and indirect effects
were greater in the analysis with the imputed data. The pattern of missing
data and analyses suggested that attrition led to a possible underestima-
tion of the direct and indirect effect sizes in the complete case analyses. In
particular, within the fully adjusted model using imputed data, the in-
direct path from impaired social communication to self-harm through
depressive symptoms was estimated as product coefficient [b] ¼ 0.099,
95% CI ¼ 0.06�0.14, p < .001, whereas the total effect was estimated
as regression coefficient [b] ¼ 0.282, 95% CI ¼ 0.10�0.46, p ¼ .002.
Based on analyses using imputed data, we would estimate that a slightly
higher proportion (35%) of the total association between impaired social
communication and self-harm is accounted for by the indirect path
through depressive symptoms.
Association Between ASD and Confounding Variables
Overall, compared to adolescents without ASD, adolescents with ASD
diagnosis and autistic traits were more likely to be male, to come from
less socioeconomically advantaged families (as indexed by lower parental
social class, worse housing, lower levels of maternal education, and
presence of financial problems), and had older mothers who reported
higher levels of perinatal mental health problems (anxiety and depression;
Table S1).
