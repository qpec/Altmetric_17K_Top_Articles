Abstract
Background
Current research suggests that while patients are becoming more engaged across the
health delivery spectrum, this involvement occurs most often at the pre-preparation stage to
identify ‘high-level’ priorities in health ecosystem priority setting, and at the preparation
phase for health research.
Objective
The purpose of this systematic rapid review of the literature is to describe the evidence that
does exist in relation to patient and public engagement priority setting in both health ecosys-
tem and health research.
Data sources
HealthStar (via OVID); CINAHL; Proquest Databases; and Scholar’s Portal.
Study eligibility criteria
i) published in English; ii) published within the timeframe of 2007—Current (10 years) unless
the report/article was formative in synthesizing key considerations of patient engagement in
health ecosystem and health research priority setting; iii) conducted in Canada, the US,
Europe, UK, Australia/New Zealand, or Scandinavian countries.
Study appraisal and synthesis
i) Is the research valid, sound, and applicable?; ii) what outcomes can we potentially expect
if we implement the findings from this research?; iii) will the target population (i.e., health
researchers and practitioners) be able to use this research?. A summary of findings from
each of the respective processes was synthesized to highlight key information that would
support decision-making for researchers when determining the best priority setting process
to apply for their specific patient-oriented research.

 Results
Seventy articles from the UK, US, Canada, Netherlands and Australia were selected for
review. Results were organized into two tiers of public and patient engagement in prioritiza-
tion: Tier 1—Deliberative and Tier 2—Consultative. Highly structured patient and public
engagement planning activities include the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships
(UK), Dialogue Method (Netherlands), Global Evidence Mapping (Australia), and the Deep
Inclusion Method/CHoosing All Together (US).
Limitations
The critical study limitations include challenges in comprehensively identifying the patient
engagement literature for review, bias in article selection due to the identified scope, missed
information due to a more limited use of exhaustive search strategies (e.g., in-depth hand
searching), and the heterogeneity of reported study findings.
Conclusion
The four public and patient engagement priority setting processes identified were successful
in setting priorities that are inclusive and objectively based, specific to the priorities of stake-
holders engaged in the process. The processes were robust, strategic and aimed to pro-
mote equity in patient voices. Key limitations identified a lack of evaluation data on the
success and extent in which patients were engaged. Issues pertaining to feasibility of stake-
holder engagement, coordination, communication and limited resources were also
considered.
Introduction
In Canada, the Strategy for Patient-Oriented Research (SPOR) was initiated to foster evidence-
informed health care by bringing innovative approaches to the point of care for greater quality,
accountability and accessibility [1]. The coalition of federal, provincial, and territorial partners
is dedicated to integrating the patient voice into the research process to better ensure the
patient voice and perspective is incorporated into policy and practice. Each SPOR SUPPORT
(Support for People and Patient-Oriented Research and Trials) Unit offers locally accessible,
multidisciplinary clusters of specialized research services, knowledge, and patient engagement
to cultivate patient-oriented research and to facilitate a research culture change in response to
the local needs and infrastructure gaps.
There is a critical opportunity to validate methodologies and frameworks for meaningful
patient and public engagement in prioritization across the spectrum of research and decision-
making activities. Given its relative infancy, there is a need to grow an evidentiary base about
what works in achieving and sustaining productive patient engagement overall [2] and what
does not [3]. This evidence will ultimately help to evaluate whether meaningful public and
patient engagement priority setting impacts enhanced patient and family-centered care, ser-
vice delivery, and health outcomes. There is a growing consensus identified in the literature
that consulting with the public and patients is the necessary link between decision-makers and
potential knowledge users [4, 5]. Indeed, without such engagement from the earliest stages,

 researchers and clinicians may ultimately miss the needs deemed as high priority by the end
users [5].
Much of the current literature focusses on patient engagement across the health care deliv-
ery spectrum [6], although there is increased interest in implementing engagement opportuni-
ties in planning activities. Evidence suggests involvement in planning occurs most often at the
‘pre-preparation’ stage for identifying ‘high-level’ priorities in the health ecosystem (i.e., deci-
sion-making about health systems agendae and strategic planning opportunities) [7] and at
the ‘preparation’ phase for research (i.e., identifying research topics, prioritizing topics, and
developing/refining research questions) [8]. However, as evidenced by a recent scoping review
conducted by this paper’s authors about patient engagement in health research, the literature
is lacking in the provision of practical guidance on how to engage with the public and patients
to obtain their perspectives. Based on these findings, it can also be inferred that a limited
understanding of the best practices that focus on engaging patients and the public at the earlier
stages of health ecosystem and health research priority setting also exists.
As such, members of the Patient Engagement Platform of the Alberta SPOR SUPPORT
Unit (AbSPORU) conducted a rapid systematic review to describe the existing evidence about
engaging patients and the public in the ‘pre-preparation’ and ‘preparation’ phases of health
ecosystem and research priority setting. In this report the methods, findings, summary of key
learnings, and suggested opportunities to support patient engagement in health planning and
research are described. In particular, based on the findings, we will describe how patient
engagement is used to promote collaboration and decision-making among patients, carers,
researchers, health practitioners and decision-makers. The emphasis is on utilizing appropriate
tools based on purpose, scope, and capacity particularly at the highest level of patient engage-
ment, known as ‘deliberative engagement’ [9, 10].
Definitions in public and patient engagement in prioritization
Similar to the findings of the previous scoping review led by the AbSPORU PE Platform [11]
the language used to describe the spectrum of engagement across priority-setting activities is
inconsistent. For example, Amba et al. [12] suggested that while ‘agenda setting’ and ‘priority
setting’ are used interchangeably, they refer to different models and strategies to engage
patients, carers, and clinicians in health research and beyond. Therefore, for the purpose of
this review, the following definitions were operationalized and used in structuring the review:
1. Health ecosystem priority setting
Engaging the public and patients in priority setting in the health ecosystem was initially framed
by principles of Participatory Action Research (PAR) which is defined by the engagement of
public and patients in visioning or goal setting exercises [7]. Priority setting in the health eco-
system is framed by Khodyakov’s [13] definition of patients who are engaged in decision-mak-
ing concerned with the planning and designing of programs. This implies patients being
engaged in macro- or meso-level decisions more so than in clinical decision-making [14].
2. Research priority setting
Priority setting in health research is specifically guided by the Patient Outcome Centered
Research Initiative’s (PCORI) definition of engaging patients in topic solicitation, prioritiza-
tion, and framing of the research question [8, 15]. Specifically, this area of engagement focusses
on what knowledge is (or questions are) valued most by patients and the public as they become
experts in their health care experiences. They should have a say in determining research priori-
ties and informing clinical decision-making [16].

 At the same time, it is critical to note that despite the articulated definitions, the findings
suggested an overlapping of characteristics for both priority setting activities i.e., health ecosys-
tem and research, making a separate analysis of the results ineffective, limiting meaningful
application to the end user. As such, the authors chose to organize the results using the distin-
guishing characteristics of engagement activities, which are the types and levels of engagement.
These range from highly structured approaches with a high level of engagement to one-off
consultations that are more limited in the opportunity for meaningful engagement. To opera-
tionalize the degree of public and patient engagement priority setting within the scope of this
paper, Rowe and Frewer’s public engagement framework [17] was adapted to outline the three
levels of public and patient engagement priority setting from least to most interactive [14]. The
levels of engagement are integrated with Khodyakov’s [13] and Szelest’s [18] definitions of
roles for patients in ‘health ecosystem priority setting’ and ‘health research priority setting’
respectively. This implies patients being engaged in decisions that inform direct clinical deci-
sion-making more so at the micro-level.
As noted by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) [19], engagement
is broadly defined and can therefore encompass distinct levels of interactivity. The IAP2 Spec-
trum of Engagement (2014) clearly outlines five levels of engagement, which denote degrees of
public participation. The spectrum suggests that the greater the degree of participation, the
more influence the community has in its decision-making Vandall-Walker’s [20] Levels of
Patient and Researcher Engagement in Health Research, adapted from the IAP2 spectrum,
involves six levels of engagement, and further identifies the relative time, knowledge and mon-
etary investment required by bothresearchers and patients, and mechanisms by which this can
be addressed
Pratt et al. [21] assert that the deeper degrees of participation are better framed as ‘partner-
ships’. Indeed, deliberative processes of engagement extend beyond ‘focus group’ methods and
instead add a range of opportunities for stakeholders to provide input [9]. This partnership
level of engagement occurs when “the act of dialogue and negotiation serves to transform
opinion in the members of both parties” [17].
The public and patient engagement priority setting matrix developed for the specific pur-
pose of this review is depicted in Table 1. The different levels of engagement are further catego-
rized into ‘tiers’ of public and patient engagement priority setting. To note, as identified in the
IAP2 Spectrum, patients and the public can also participate in a ‘one way’ communication pro-
cess (i.e., Communicative), where they can simply learn about the priority setting processes.
Examples include a public hearing or meeting, drop-in Centre or online information. This
level of engagement is not included in Table 1 since the emphasis in this emergent area is to
move away from one-way information transfer from decision-makers and researchers to the
public, to a two-way process, as depicted by the Learn/Inform level of engagement noted by
[20] (Fig 1). Furthermore, the role of the public and patient is to move beyond sharing of infor-
mation amongst themselves and instead to seek out roles with researchers from the Consulta-
tion level to the Lead-level in priority-setting processes.
Methods
A literature review was conducted using a systematic rapid review process, which is a more
accelerated method of reviewing the literature compared with traditional systematic reviews.
The PRISMA 2009 Checklist was used to endorse good reporting on the methods (S1 File).
The advantages of this method are that it is quick, requires limited time and resources, and is
functional in supporting informed decision-making. Emphasis is placed on locating and using
synthesized research evidence and where not available, high-quality or recent primary studies

 [22]. A study protocol was first developed to describe the rationale and planned methods of
the review (S2 File). This was prepared before the review and used when in its execution. A
seven step process was used to undertake the review. All authors contributed and refined the
review’s search strategy. Given its limited scope and timeline, the principal researcher (EM)
conducted the literature search, applied the selection and critical appraisal criteria, selected the
final article yield and extracted the relevant data. The established process provided the

 principal researcher (EM) with a framework to use in discussion with the other authors partic-
ularly when determining if an article met the selection or quality criteria.
Step 1—Identify research questions
The following research questions were identified i) what are the methods of engaging the pub-
lic and patients in ‘health ecosystem priority setting’ and ‘health research priority setting’ activ-
ities?; ii) What are the outcomes of engaging the public and patients in ‘health ecosystem
priority setting’ and ‘health research priority setting’ activities?
Step 2—Identify and select search terms
Next, given that this paper focusses on priority setting specifically, a review of key articles
related to priority setting were identified and reviewed from the initial scoping review [11] to
determine specific language that targetted the priority setting literature.
As well, to focus the search to health and health care literature, additional search terms
were used to filter studies for inclusion that pertained to priority setting within the context of
health and the health care system.
A combination of approaches was used to ensure that nuances in language were captured
and documented as part of this research study. Search terms were adapted as needed to best
meet the requirements of each database. Additional filters (e.g., geography, year of publication,
language) were applied when available in the databases, to further refine the search and yield
appropriate articles to the inclusion and exclusion criteria.
The search terms were as follows: patient engagement OR patient participation OR Involve
AND research priority setting OR consensus build� OR research consult� AND health OR
healthcare. (S1 Table)
Step 3—Identify and select data sources
A three-pronged approach was used to collect data. First, specific and appropriate electronic
databases were identified to explore the research questions with the assistance of Ryerson Uni-
versity Library Services accessible to the principle researcher (EM). Given the stated methods,
the search strategy was narrowed to four relevant databases using all authors’ experiences in
extracting relevant article yields and the principal researcher’s accessibility via the stated univer-
sity’s library system: HealthStar (via OVID); CINAHL; Proquest Databases; and Scholar’s Portal.
Second, a targeted grey literature search was conducted. Each of the formal databases pro-
vided the option to also scan grey literature sources, which was a search included to broaden
the reach of literature reviewed. Article titles that met the study selection criteria and clearly
outlined the process, methods, and/or outcomes of priority setting, were inputted into the
Ryerson University Library Services “Search Everything” database and PubMed’s “Single Cita-
tion Matcher”. Articles that were similar, relevant, or had been cited from the article title
inputted, were reviewed for inclusion. Third, based on the identified process and methods of
patient engagement, additional hand searching of the specific tools and/or frameworks was
conducted (e.g., James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnership Manual).
The author feel confident in the search yield because of their combined use of various data
sources as well as relying on literature from formal and manual search strategies.
Step 4—Establish eligibility criteria
The following selection criteria were established based on the purpose and scope of the search.
To be included in the review, articles had to address research priority setting at any or all

 points of the priority setting process and be: i) published in English; ii) published within the
timeframe of 2007—Current (10 years) unless the report/article was formative in synthesizing
key considerations of patient engagement in health ecosystem and health research priority set-
ting; iii) conducted in Canada, the US, Europe, UK, Australia/New Zealand, or Scandinavian
countries. Of those articles meeting the inclusion criteria, the following exclusion criteria were
applied: does not clearly identify process, methods, and/or outcomes related to the health eco-
system or health research priority setting.
Step 5—Apply critical appraisal criteria
To keep the research article yield focused within the predefined scope, the following quality
selection criteria questions [23] were applied before selecting the article for data extraction: i)
is the research valid, sound, and applicable?; ii) what outcomes can we potentially expect if we
implement the findings from this research?; iii) will the target population (i.e., health research-
ers and practitioners) be able to use this research?. Articles that met all three of these criteria
were selected for data extraction.
Step 6—Search input and data extraction
Articles from this search were compiled into a comprehensive data extraction table. The data
extracted included the resource citation, study methodology, study setting, technique, key
activities, study outcomes, author considerations for barriers, and author consideration for
facilitators,. From this information, the processes and activities described in the included arti-
cles were organized across the two aforementioned tiers of engagement i.e. Tier 1—Delibera-
tive and Tier 2—Consultative. Few authors identified the level of participation explicitly using
language such as ‘deliberative’ or ‘consultative’. As expected, most authors implicitly described
levels of public and patient engagement. Therefore, articles were manually categorized based
on the characteristics noted in the data extraction table.
Step 7—Summarize key findings
A summary of findings from each of the respective processes was synthesized to highlight key
information that would support decision-making for researchers when determining the best
priority setting process to apply for their specific patient-oriented research. The data is
reported in table format in the Findings to facilitate ease of comparison across priority setting
processes.
Results
Seventy articles were selected for this systematic rapid review (S1 Fig) (S2 Table). In Table 2,
the characteristics of the selected articles are described.
Overview of findings
‘Health ecosystem priority setting’ activities were most often identified at the ‘Consultative’
level of engagement (Tier 2). ‘Health research priority setting’ activities were most often identi-
fied at the ‘Deliberative’ (Tier 1) and ‘Consultative’ (Tier 2) engagement levels. In Table 3,
examples of engagement processes and activities are organized according to the two identified
levels of engagement.

 Tier 1 public and patient engagement priority setting processes
A description of Tier 1 deliberative engagement activities in ‘health ecosystem priority setting’
were limited to Khodyakov’s [13] literature review, and were limited in description. The litera-
ture better emphasized highly-structured patient and public engagement planning processes
and activities for research, including the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships
(UK) [10, 16, 24–35], the Dialogue Method (Netherlands) [25, 36–39], Global Evidence Map-
ping (Australia) [5], and the Deep Inclusion Method/CHoosing All Together (US) [21, 40].
While these research planning processes and activities differed, a common approach across
Tier 1 public and patient engagement priority setting in research planning included gathering
and analyzing identified research priorities by engaging patients and the public along with cli-
nicians and researchers, followed by prioritization of topics through dialogue between all
stakeholders. In Table 4, a summary of the Tier 1 public and patient engagement priority set-
ting processes for health research is provided, including the aims, key characteristics, barriers,
and facilitators of each of the identified models.
Overall, Tier 1 public and patient engagement priority setting research planning processes
and activities demonstrated positive outcomes in setting priorities that were inclusive and
objectively validated in the literature. Using the JLA process, for example, evidence of success
was demonstrated by recent examples in acne treatments [33], prostate cancer research [34],
wound care [10], kidney transplantation and dialysis [16, 32, 41], and dementia [31] among
others. However, reporting of outcomes of the process was predominantly descriptive rather
than evaluative. A mechanism for formal evaluation to measure the impact of these different
planning processes on the quality of partnership and subsequent outputs is needed [10]. To

 note, the Dialogue Model process was tested over a 5-year period (2003–2007) for research pri-
ority setting based on seven case studies related to spinal cord injuries, neuromuscular dis-
eases, renal failures, asthma/COPD, burns, diabetes, and intellectual disabilities [12]. While
each case study demonstrated success in prioritizing research questions specific to the condi-
tions and population, Amba et al. [12] noted that translating the Dialogue Model process to
the particulars of the specific context was important, providing a useful opportunity to expand
implementation and evaluation efforts of this process. This implies that ‘one size does not fit
all’ in implementing public and patient engagement priority setting processes and activities
Tier 2 public and patient engagement priority setting processes
Articles in which several different data collection activities were identified to engage patients
were reviewed, such as through surveys and key informant interviews [44–51], focus groups
[13, 14, 52–66], and patient panels [67]. While data collection activities differed, a common
approach across Tier 2 included a two-step process. First, reviewing the literature and using
expert opinion to determine a set of potential topics of interest; and second, using the topics
determined as the basis for a survey for input by health professionals and the public [48].
Open-ended responses were critical [50]. Online surveys, key informant interviews, use of
World Cafe
´ or Dotmocracy facilitation tools provided the data [66].
Overall, evidence reviewed for Tier 2 public and patient engagement priority setting was
more limited in describing comprehensive examples of facilitating patient engagement in
health ecosystem and health research priority setting planning activities, although detailed
techniques for structuring focus groups, surveys, and other group facilitation activities are
available in the literature, but were deemed out-of-scope for this review. A lack of practical
guidance on how to integrate public input with other forms of evidence, such as scientific arti-
cles, remains [14]. Reporting of operational details including cost, infrastructure, and timeline
was limited or non-existent. Furthermore, there were few documented studies describing the
effectiveness of the different data collection activities, as evaluation was typically informal and
based on the perspectives of those organizing the engagement activities [14, 68].
Most often, success was not reliant on clear evaluation metrics but on the authors’ reviews
of the process [56] or on opinions formed in reaching objectives that were not explicitly stated
a priori [14, 56]. For example, Rideout et al. [52] identified that engaging patients at the macro
level provided ample opportunity for shared research collaboration related to CVD and mental

content areas and one from the public/community leaders. Conklin et al. [56] underscored
that outcomes were inadequate due to insufficient periods of observation to measure the
impact on policy and practice. However, authors were clear that local-level initiatives (vs.
regional or national) were most likely to ultimately impact patient-centeredness and quality of
care [45].
Tier 1 and Tier 2 public and patient engagement priority setting
limitations and opportunities
In Table 5, limitations and opportunities organized by individual, facilitation, and organiza-
tional perspectives are summarized [15, 37, 55, 59, 60].
Discussion
The key findings from this systematic rapid review of priority setting are supportive of the
existing but limited recommendations outlined in the public and patient engagement priority
setting literature [6, 10, 60, 63, 69, 70]. However, two predominant themes are worth discuss-
ing beyond the operational details of public and patient engagement priority setting activities,
including the role of ethics in involving patients and the public as well as the opportunity for
evaluation of engagement.
As referenced across the public and patient engagement priority setting and patient and
public engagement literature, the risk of tokenism is high across all patient-engagement oppor-
tunities, limiting the output of the benefits of true engagement. In response, Pandya-Wood
et al. [71] outlined the importance of developing an ‘ethically conscious’ framework for public
and patient engagement priority setting. Addressing ethical considerations is critical for avoid-
ing inadequate allocation of time that may result in a lesser impact on public engagement,
tokenism, and potentially leading to public members being disenfranchised and unable to con-
tribute fully to the study and as a result, disengaging. Ways to embed an ethical perspective in
any engagement opportunity be it for patient and public engagement or public and patient

 engagement priority setting include: Timeframe: i) build realistic timeframes, including a
research design stage which offers public involvement for at least two weeks to read, clarify,
and provide feedback on the process; ii) Visibility: Make any public contributions visible; be
transparent about how the public has been involved; iii) Accessibility: The public members
involved in the research design stage require information, as do the rest of the research team,
but communicated in way that they can access and understand, using plain language.
Finally, of critical importance to patient and public engagement in general and public and
patient engagement priority setting in particular, is the role of evaluation in patient engage-
ment in decision-making activities. Limited evaluative evidence may hinder future uptake of
patient and public engagement in prioritization and decision-making exercises [10, 25, 43].
This includes the patient perspective about how, when, and why they are engaged and under-
scores the importance of continuing to catalogue public and patient engagement activities,
including evaluation using validated tools to solicit the perspective of the public/patients,
researchers, policy-makers, and organizations [58]. For example, Abelson et al. [58] reported
on the development of the Public and Patient Engagement Evaluation Tool (PPEET) which
includes three questionnaires designed to elicit feedback from: i) those who participate in Pub-
lic and Patient engagement activities; ii) those who plan, execute, or sponsor Public and Patient
engagement activities within an organization; and iii) those who provide leadership and capac-
ity for Public and Patient engagement within their organizations. The questionnaires are
guided by the key public and patient engagement principles of: Integrity of design and process;
Influence and impact; Participatory culture; and Collaboration and Common Purpose. Chung
et al. [44] also developed a publically available database for cataloguing current community
engagement activities that can be leveraged for future engagement opportunities. This may
also help with planning future steps to address engagement opportunities by supporting deci-
sion-makers with the tools needed to adequately, meaningfully, and effectively engage the pub-
lic and patients, and in particular in public and patient engagement priority setting. With no
consensus on the ‘gold standard’ of engagement [42], decision-makers require support for
informed decision-making on effective public and patient engagement techniques. This may
also help foster the much needed ‘buy in’ from patients, carers, researchers, and decision-
makers.
Limitations
The critical study limitations include challenges in comprehensively identifying the patient
engagement literature for review, bias in article selection due to the identified scope, missed
information due to a more limited use of exhaustive search strategies (e.g., in-depth hand
searching), and the heterogeneity of reported study findings. These limitations can somewhat
decrease the ability of the review to inform practical recommendations to support patient
engagement in health research [72].
While the authors made the effort to focus the search for an article yield that was useful and
meaningful, it is expected that not all articles that meet this review’s selection criteria were
identified and selected. which is an inherent limitation of the stated methods. A lack of uni-
form reporting on indexing methods for an emerging area like patient engagement is a docu-
mented challenge in this emergent research area [73–74]. In itself, a wide range of terms are
used across the patient engagement literature, to describe patient engagement in health
research. This consideration was included in the design and execution of this systematic rapid
review, although it is expected it may have impacted the yield.
In addition, the total number of articles selected for this review may have been limited by i)
search terms that were not included as part of the search strategy; ii) limiting the number of

 databases used to conduct the search; and iii) limiting the grey literature search through data-
bases instead of conducting this search manually (e.g., Google, Google Scholar).
Lastly, due to the heterogeneity of studies included, extracting specifically desired data from
studies was a challenge, limiting the interpretation and generalizability of the results within the
appropriate context of this review. With a longer timeline, additional resources, and a second
researcher to conduct, review/appraise and select the relevant articles independently from the
primary researcher the study’s yield may have been further strengthened. Additional research
that emphasizes useful and transparent findings of patient engagement using the GRIPP2
(Guidance for Reporting Involvement of Patients and Public) [75] checklist criteria for patient
and public involvement may better ensure that this research focus continues to evolve in a
manner that is more meaningful to patients and health outcomes.
At the same time, these limitations are mitigated by: i) inclusion of articles from AbSPORU
PE Platform-led scoping review of patient engagement in health research [11]; ii) Inclusion of
articles of relevance sent by staff from the Alberta SPOR Support Unit; iii) review of reference
lists and input of single citation matchers for identified articles; iv) widening of the typical
timeframe for selected articles (i.e., 3–5 years) given the emergent nature of the patient engage-
ment enterprise.
Recommendations
Additional opportunities to leverage the existing recommendations are offered for consider-
ation. The authors suggest the following to focus efforts on cataloguing public and patient
engagement priority setting initiatives:
1. Maintain adequate data monitoring, collection, and evaluation to support continued inter-
est in public and patient engagement priority setting and to encourage ‘buy in’ from public/
patients, researchers, and decision-makers;
2. Describe operational details of public and patient engagement priority setting ‘best prac-
tices’: There is need for better reporting of operational details of public and patient engage-
ment priority setting that both worked and did not work, including process activities,
sampling, cost, time, outputs and evaluation. This will help inform decision-making on
which processes and activities will best suit the given circumstance or context for public
and patient engagement priority setting activities. An example of one reporting tool
includes creating and managing a data collection template for ongoing public and patient
engagement priority setting activities;
3. Prioritize evaluation of public and patient engagement priority setting initiatives: To sup-
plement existing descriptive outcomes, evaluative outcomes of the impact of patient and
public engagement in health ecosystem and health research priority setting are needed to
build a robust evidence-base for patient and public engagement specifically in priority set-
ting activities. Priority setting activities are a useful entry for patient and public engagement
activities across the research spectrum; and
4. Integrate knowledge mobilization opportunities: While evaluation of findings is important,
it is equally important to ensure a knowledge mobilization plan is integrated into the public
and patient engagement priority setting process to ensure patient and public engagement
priorities are translated into action.
It is intended that the AbSPORU PE Platform will consider and take action on these points,
as well as on the evidence synthesized in this review, to support future decision-making with
