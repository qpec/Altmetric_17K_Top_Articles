What is already known?
 
► Patellar tendon related pain is relatively common in 
physically active children and adolescents.
What are the new findings?
 
► Only three randomised controlled clinical trials have 
tested an intervention versus comparator in a pop-
ulation with a reasonable number of children and 
adolescents.
 
► All studies had a high risk of bias. Specifically, ‘usual 
care’ provided was highly variable which provided a 
substantial source of bias.
 
► In one study, hyperosmolar dextrose injection (com-
bined with local anaesthetic) was superior to both 
local anaesthetic injection and usual care.
 
► This review found no evidence to justify surgery for 
Osgood-Schlatter disease.
AbsTrACT
Objective Evaluate effectiveness and harms of 
interventions for patellar tendon related pain in children 
and adolescents.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources Medline via Pubmed, Embase via OVID, 
CINAHL via Ebsco, SportDiscus up until 24 November 2017 
were searched.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Inclusion 
criteria were (1) controlled or randomised controlled 
clinical trials (RCTs), (2) participants with diagnosis of 
patellar tendon related disorder, (3) participants≤18 years 
of age at enrolment and (4) published in a peer-reviewed 
English or Scandinavian language journal.
results Of 530 studies identified, eight were included 
after screening, with three included in data synthesis. 
To be included in data synthesis, we required studies to 
have included (and have data available for) a minimum of 
10 participants under 18 years. All studies were rated as 
being at high risk of bias. For adolescents with patellar 
tendinopathy, one RCT compared eccentric exercises to 
usual care and found no difference between groups. In 
adolescents with Osgood-Schlatter disease (OSD), injection 
of local anaesthetic with dextrose proved superior to either 
usual care or local anaesthetic alone (three armed RCTs). 
In a retrospective case controlled study in adolescents 
with OSD, surgery provided no benefit over conservative 
management in terms of persistent symptoms and had a 
higher complication rate.
Conclusion There is weak evidence to support the use of 
dextrose injection with local anaesthetic and no evidence 
to support the use of specific types of exercises to treat 
children/adolescents with OSD/patellar tendinopathy. Until 
further evidence arises, clinicians should include load 
modification and advise on a return to sport based on 
symptoms.
InTrODuCTIOn
Patellar tendon related pain conditions are 
common in children and adolescents, appear 
to begin in childhood and increase in prev-
alence during adolescence up to age 18.1 
Patellar tendon related pain is an umbrella 
term, which encompasses Osgood-Schlatter’s 
disease 
(OSD), 
Sinding-Larsen-Johansson 
disease and patellar tendinopathy. OSD 
affects 1 in 10 adolescents and as many as 1 
in 5 in certain sports.2 3 There is a paucity of 
high-quality evidence relating to prognosis.
In one prospective cohort study in 18 
adolescents with OSD, even 2 years after 
initial diagnosis, over 60% demonstrated 
persistent patellar tendon changes (evalu-
ated by ultrasonography) and continued to 
display deficits in functional performance. 
Individuals with a history of OSD can experi-
ence persistent pain, years later, in their early 
20s,4–6 associated with OSD lesions, under-
scoring that these pain complaints may not go 
away on their own if treated with a ‘wait and 
see’ approach. Interventions which reliably 
improve long-term outcomes are needed.7
While there is a large body of randomised 
trials and high-quality systematic reviews for 
managing patellar tendon related disor-
ders in adults, there is a complete lack of 
systematic evaluations of treatment strategies 
specifically for adolescents and children.8 
Considering patellar tendon related pain 
seem to start around the age of 10,1 there is 
a need for evidence and syntheses specific to

this population. This is especially important considering 
some of these patellar tendon related pain complaints are 
unique to adolescent period, for example, Sinding-Lars-
en-Johansson syndrome and OSD.
The aim of this study was to perform a systematic review 
(and if possible, meta-analysis) of the benefits and harms 
of different treatment options for patella tendon related 
pain in children and adolescents.
METhODs
The systematic review was prospectively registered the 
review in PROSPERO (registration number 82736 link). 
The review was informed according to the Cochrane 
guidelines and is reported according to the PRISMA 
statement.
Data sources and searches
We carried out a systematic search in the following 
bibliographic databases: Medline via Pubmed, Embase 
via OVID, CINAHL via Ebsco, SportDiscus up until 24 
November 2017. The search terms and strategy were 
developed with a research librarian and are available in 
online supplementary material 1.
Inclusion/exclusion criteria
Studies evaluating any intervention for any type of 
patellar tendon related pain in children or adolescents 
were eligible for inclusion, providing the design included 
an intervention and a comparator. Specifically, non-ran-
domised controlled clinical trials and randomised 
controlled trials (RCTs) (including semi/quasi-ran-
domised and cluster randomised trials) were eligible. 
Any therapeutic intervention or control treatments were 
included (including, but not restricted to, non-surgical 
interventions, injection-based interventions, exercise, 
surgical interventions or standard care/wait and see  and 
so on). Studies had to include children or adolescents 
(aged under 18 years), with patellar tendon related pain. 
We included any publications in English or Scandinavian 
languages. Studies were excluded if reporting on primary 
complaints of patellofemoral joint disorders including 
patellofemoral pain a, patellofemoral instability, acute 
traumatic causes of knee pain, inflammatory arthritis, or 
if they included a population age >18 years. If the study 
included a mixed-age population extending across the 
age limits in our inclusion criteria, we requested age-spe-
cific data for those <18 years from trial authors.
selection of studies
Duplicates were removed and relevant studies iden-
tified from the search were imported into Covidence 
for screening. Studies were independently screened by 
title and abstract by two authors (TO and GC). This was 
followed by full text evaluation of the selected studies 
from the first selection step by both authors. Disagree-
ment between the two reviewers was solved by consensus 
involving a third reviewer (BD).
Outcomes
Our primary domains of interest were pain, function 
and sport participation. Reports on the number and 
type(s) of adverse effects (harms) related to interven-
tions were extracted and recorded. Additionally, all 
other reported outcomes were considered of potential 
interest and extracted. We did not impose any restric-
tions on endpoints; a priori we defined endpoints of 
interest as immediate effects (0–7 days after receiving 
treatment), short-term (1 week to 3 months), medi-
um-term (3–6 months) and long-term (above 6 
months).
Data extraction
Two reviewers (GC and BD) independently extracted 
data. Data were extracted using a custom data extraction 
sheet in Covidence. Data regarding study design and 
setting, sample characteristics (including diagnoses, age, 
sex, demographics), inclusion criteria, intervention types 
and characteristics, follow-up, compliance, withdrawals, 
outcomes and any adverse events were extracted. Incon-
sistencies were resolved by consensus discussion. A third 
review (MSR) was available for disagreements that could 
not be resolved by discussion.
If relevant data were not available from full-text arti-
cles or trial registrations, authors were contacted to 
provide this information. For studies including mixed 
populations (both adolescents and adults), individual 
participant data for those 18 and under were requested. 
Authors were sent two subsequent reminders over 6 
weeks. Studies were excluded from data synthesis if indi-
vidual patients were not provided or studies included less 
than 10 participants under 18.
risk of bias assessment
Two independent raters (BD and GC) assessed risk 
of bias using the Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for 
assessing risk of bias in randomised trials. Each trial 
was evaluated across seven domains of bias, including 
one or more items that are were appraised in two parts. 
Assessment followed the description in the Cochrane 
Handbook for Systematic Review of Interventions, 
V.5.1 (Part 2: 8.5.1) as follows. First, the relevant trials’ 
characteristics related to the item were summarised. 
Second, each bias domain was judged as high or low risk 
of bias, according to their possible effect on the results 
of the trial. When the possible effect was unknown or 
insufficient detail was reported, the item was judged 
as unclear. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. 
A third party (MSR) was available in case of persistent 
disagreement.
Data analysis
It was specified a priori, a meta-analysis would only be 
performed if data were available for similar time-points, 
outcomes and interventions. As this was not possible, we 
conducted a narrative synthesis of the results based on 
the domains of interest.

Figure 1 Flowchart of systematic review protocol.
rEsulTs
A total of 530 studies were identified by the search 
strategy. After screening, eight studies were identified 
as eligible for inclusion (figure 1, PRISMA flowchart). 
Of these, seven were RCTs, and one was a retrospective 
non-randomised controlled trial. Two studies specifically 
included an adolescent-only population (both OSD). 
The other six studies were on patellar tendinopathy 
and included a mixed sample. Study characteristics are 
provided in table 1 and table 2. Additional information 
of included studies is available in online supplementary 
material 1 (S1).
Osgood-schlatter
Topol et al9 compared usual care versus local anaesthetic 
versus local anaesthetic and dextrose in a threearmed 
RCT for OSD. The outcome was the Nirschl Pain Phase 
Scale (NPPS) at 3 months. The superiority of dextrose 
and local anaesthetic compared with local anaesthetic 
alone was shown (SMD: 0.83, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.45, 
p=0.006) or usual care (SMD: 1.66, 95% CI 0.96 to 2.36, 
p<0.0001) (see online supplementary material for Forest 
plots).
Trail10 compared surgery (tibial sequestrectomy) with 
conservative treatment in a retrospective non-randomised 
parallel group study of OSD. Participants were categori-
cally rated as ‘symptomatic’ or ‘asymptomatic’ at final 
review approximately 5 years from initial diagnosis. The 
odds of being asymptomatic was not significantly different 
with surgery compared with conservative treatment (OR 
1.48, 95% CI 0.33 to 6.65) (see online supplementary 
material for Forest plots). Several patients in both groups 
were subject to other interventions (including refraining 
from sport, cast treatment, physiotherapy and steroid 
injections).
Patellar tendinopathy
Only one11 of the six studies including mixed popula-
tions of adolescents and adults was included in the data 
synthesis (details of exclusion outlined below). This 
study by Biernat et al compared the effect of usual care 
to eccentric exercises in male adolescents on patient-re-
corded outcomes (VISA-P questionnaire). There was 
no significant difference between groups at either 12 or 
24 weeks (SMD: 0.45, 95% CI −0.44 to 1.35, p=0.32 and 
SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.26, p=0.42, respectively) (see 
online supplementary material for Forest plot) table 2.
Two studies were excluded from data synthesis as they 
did not contain a large enough sample of adolescents 
(N=0 and N=1 adolescent included).12 13 One study was 
excluded from data synthesis because data for adoles-
cents could not be extracted,14 and two studies could not 
be included in the data synthesis due to non-response to 
requests for data for adolescent participants.15 16
harms
Only one study reported on potential harms. Trail 
reported a lower overall complication rate for conserva-
tive treatment,10 compared with surgery (OR 0.11, 95% 
CI 0.03 to 0.38) (see online supplementary material for 
plot  harms OR).10 Complications were primarily pres-
ence of bony prominence (6 in conservative group and 
18 in surgical group). The surgical group had additional 
complications (three with areas of anaesthesia lateral to 
scar, one infection, one wound dehiscence, one stiffness 
and one recurvatum).
risk of bias
Overall, all studies were deemed to be at high risk of bias, 
particularly in the domains of reporting bias and perfor-
mance bias (figure 2 and figure 3)
Studies identified and excluded at each stage are 
detailed in figure 1.
DIsCussIOn
The key finding of this review is the lack of studies 
assessing the effectiveness of interventions for patellar 
tendon related pain in children and adolescents. Despite 
commonality of these disorders in this population, 
only three studies have assessed any intervention. All 
three were at high risk of bias, especially reporting bias, 
blinding and had significant methodological weaknesses 
(with one being a retrospective parallel group case-se-
ries). This makes in nearly impossible to guide clinical 
practice on how to best to manage these common pain 
complaints in children and adolescents.
Adults and adolescents—potentially not the same
The problem is that while there is evidence supporting 
certain interventions (eg, tendon loading programmes) 
for patellar tendon related pain in adults,17 the findings 
of these cannot be directly transferred into children and

adolescents. The pathological features of tendinopathy 
includes increased cellularity, a loss of collagen structure 
and chondroid metaplasia.18 19 There is an increasing 
body of evidence demonstration the role of chronic 
inflammation as part of this degenerative process18 20 21 
Tendon loading programmes have been associated with 
an improved collagen turnover in adults suggesting a 
possible mechanisms of effect. However, an important 
difference between adults and adolescents is the maturity 
of the patellar tendon insertion, the enthesis organ.22 It 
is a possible that overly aggressive sporting activity and 
tendon loading during development may actually have 
a negative long-term impact in terms of both tendon 
structure and the risk of adulthood symptoms. Notably, 
a recent study has shown that increased sporting activity 
has a detrimental impact on the developing hip, which 
supports this theory. As we do not yet have a clear under-
standing of how the pathology of patellar tendon related 
pain during maturation, caution needs to be taken in 
applying such effective interventions from adults to chil-
dren and adolescents. This is particularly as adolescence 
is proposed to be a critical time for the formation of 
normal tendon attachment.23 24
Devil in the detail
One of the serious concerns with the included studies is 
the multiple differences in treatment between control 
and experimental arms. For example, in Topol et al9 the 
control group did not have a period of rest, which was in 
contrast to both injection therapy groups. This makes it 
difficult to elucidate if the observed effects were actually 
due to the intervention or to the removal of aggravating 
activities. Furthermore, a dextrose injection at 3 months 
was used as an ‘incentive’ for study participation and 
offered to all participants that did not reach an NPPS 
score of 0 (regardless of treatment allocation), to avoid 
dropout in the control arm. This could potentially influ-
ence participants’ reporting, if they had a favourable 
perception of the injection, and reported lower outcomes 
to receive it.
The high frequency of patellar tendon related disor-
ders in the sporting population is consistent with an 
’overuse’ type aetiology. In this context, any advice on 
activity modification and the manner in which it is deliv-
ered may be crucial in influencing both short-term and 
long-term outcomes. Keeping this in mind, it is arguable 
what constitutes ‘usual care’ in daily practice and in the 
included studies may have been. The ‘usual care’ was 
highly variable and included factors such as the degree to 
which sporting activity was continued and the degree to

which pain was experienced and/or allowed during sport 
or exercises. In the study by Topol et al,9 only participants 
in the injection arms were encouraged to engage in a 
sporting activity, only if the activity was not accompanied 
or followed by pain during the period of treatment. This 
contrasted with Biernat et al in which both experimental 
and control groups were subject to the same advice as 
regards continuing sporting activity.11
harms
The study by Trail10 demonstrated a significantly higher 
complication rate with surgery versus conservative treat-
ment, indicating that currently the use of surgery in this 
context should only take place in the more regulated 
context of a clinical trial. Notably, no studies analysed 
longer term outcomes into early adulthood, highlighting 
an area for future research.
lack of knowledge hampers clinical practice
The absence of high-quality evidence presents a chal-
lenge to clinicians treating children and adolescents 
with patellar tendon related pain. Adolescence is a key 
developmental period, with a mature proximal patellar 
tendon enthesis occurring after peak height velocity.25 
Given that patellar tendon structure is a predictor for 
pain,26 it is reasonable to argue that caution should 
be exercised when treating patients with an imma-
ture enthesis. Training beyond pain in order to satisfy 
short-term sporting objectives could have negative long 
term implications for the individual.27 Until further 
evidence arises, clinicians should be aware of the poten-
tial differences in patellar tendon related pain between 
adolescents and adults. These types of pain complaints 
are often associated with high levels of sports participa-
tion and sports specialisation. As sustained overload is 
thought to be a risk factor for developing, for example, 
OSD,28 it seems sensible that the mainstay of treatment 
include some form of load management. This type of 
treatment could include education where adolescents 
and parents are taught to modify training and loading 
(including recovery) based on symptoms but this has yet 
to be evaluated in a clinical trial.
Future research
Malliaras et al17 concluded that high-quality studies 
comparing different loading programmes and evalu-
ating clinical and mechanistic outcomes are needed in 
both Achilles and patellar tendinopathy rehabilitation in 
adults.17 The evidence relating to adolescents and chil-
dren is worse, and this is concerning given the potential 
long-term consequences of overuse on the developing 
bone tendon interface. Understanding the impact of 
patellar tendon related pain disorders on the maturing 
tendon and entheses on both structural and functional 
outcomes in both the short and longer term, will be 
critical in the understanding of the natural history of 
patellar tendon related disorders in adolescents. It is 
also essential to explore the needs and preference of the 
young patients being treated. It is likely that these devel-
oping young individuals have specific needs which have 
yet to be addressed during treatment. Future studies 
may also wish to identify phenotypes associated with a 
particular poor prognosis to understand the trajectory 
of pain and impairments during this crucial period of 
life.
Despite the commonality of patella tendon related 
pain in children and adolescents, there is a paucity of 
evidence specific to this population to guide clinical 
practice. There is weak evidence to support the use of 
dextrose injections and no evidence to support the use 
of specific types of exercises. Further research is essential 
to ascertain how best to manage the many children and 
adolescents suffering from these pain complaints. Until 
further evidence arises, clinicians should include load 
modification and advise on a return to sport based on 
symptoms.
