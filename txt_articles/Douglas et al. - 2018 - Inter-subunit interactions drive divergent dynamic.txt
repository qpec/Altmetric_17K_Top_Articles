Abstract
Cell motility is essential for protozoan and metazoan organisms and typically relies on the
dynamic turnover of actin filaments. In metazoans, monomeric actin polymerises into usu-
ally long and stable filaments, while some protozoans form only short and highly dynamic
actin filaments. These different dynamics are partly due to the different sets of actin regula-
tory proteins and partly due to the sequence of actin itself. Here we probe the interactions of
actin subunits within divergent actin filaments using a comparative dynamic molecular
model and explore their functions using Plasmodium, the protozoan causing malaria, and
mouse melanoma derived B16-F1 cells as model systems. Parasite actin tagged to a fluo-
rescent protein (FP) did not incorporate into mammalian actin filaments, and rabbit actin-FP
did not incorporate into parasite actin filaments. However, exchanging the most divergent
region of actin subdomain 3 allowed such reciprocal incorporation. The exchange of a single
amino acid residue in subdomain 2 (N41H) of Plasmodium actin markedly improved incor-
poration into mammalian filaments. In the parasite, modification of most subunit–subunit
interaction sites was lethal, whereas changes in actin subdomains 1 and 4 reduced efficient
parasite motility and hence mosquito organ penetration. The strong penetration defects
could be rescued by overexpression of the actin filament regulator coronin. Through these
comparative approaches we identified an essential and common contributor, subdomain 3,
which drives the differential dynamic behaviour of two highly divergent eukaryotic actins in
motile cells.

 stable filaments. However, an actin of the malaria-causing parasite Plasmodium, while
having a very similar monomer structure to actins from other eukaryotes, forms only
short and unstable filaments. These short and dynamic filaments are crucial in allowing
the parasite to move very rapidly in tissue. Here we investigated the basis of these differ-
ences. We used molecular dynamics simulations of actin filaments to investigate the
actin–actin interfaces in filaments from Plasmodium and rabbit. We next engineered para-
sites to express chimeric actins that contained different parts of rabbit and parasite actin
and thereby identified actin residues important for parasite viability and progression
across the life cycle. We could rescue the most prominent defect specifically with overex-
pression of the actin binding protein coronin. This suggests that the more stable actin
harms the parasite and that coronin helps in recycling filaments. By screening the effects
of actin chimeras in mammalian cells, we also identified regions that allow these different
actins to efficiently interact with each other. Taken together, our results improve our
understanding of the interactions required for actin to incorporate into filaments across
divergent eukaryotes.
Introduction
Actin is a highly conserved cytoskeletal protein with essential roles in cell division, contraction,
and motility. Cell motility is an important process in biological development, cancer metasta-
sis, and tissue penetration by both immune cells and pathogens. Many eukaryotic cell types
have the ability to move continuously in a substrate-dependent ameboid manner in both 2D
and 3D environments, typically by deforming their cellular shape and protruding the cell’s
leading edge [1–3]. Gliding motility is an alternative mode of locomotion displayed by some
bacteria and protists that is independent of cell shape changes [4–6]. The malaria-causing par-
asite Plasmodium employs gliding motility in several phases of its life cycle. Gliding is essential
for successful penetration of host organs such as the mosquito midgut and salivary glands as
well as the mammalian liver [7]. Prior to liver infection, high motility speeds of 1–3 μm/s allow
the parasite to escape from the dermis, where it is deposited by the biting mosquito, and
thereby evade infiltrating neutrophils, the fastest migrating human cells, which move much
slower (1–5 μm/min) [8,9]. Despite these striking differences in locomotion modes and speeds,
the fundamental requirement for these cells is the dynamic turnover of actin filaments [10–
12].
The actin monomer has a highly conserved structure that consists of four subdomains and
a central nucleotide (adenosine triphosphate [ATP], adenosine diphosphate with inorganic
phosphate [ADP + Pi], or adenosine diphosphate alone [ADP]) binding cleft (Fig 1A) [13].
Actin possesses the ability to self-assemble from monomers (G-actin) to form filaments (F-
actin), which in turn can form higher order filamentous structures. Particular regions in the
actin subdomains, such as the hydrophobic plug (H-plug) of subdomain 3 and the highly flexi-
ble DNAse I-binding loop (D-loop) of subdomain 2, as well as the nucleotide state, have been
implicated as major contributors to the formation and stability of filaments [14–16]. Actin iso-
forms of most eukaryotes inherently form long and stable filament structures (greater than
1 μm in length), display high sequence conservation across species (>90% similarity from
yeast to humans), and are regulated by a large set of actin binding proteins (ABPs) [17]. These
ABPs can affect the monomer-filament ratio and fulfil a variety of regulatory roles, including
but not limited to nucleation and elongation (e.g., formin), monomer binding (e.g., profilin),
filament binding (e.g., coronin), and filament severing (e.g., cofilin/actin depolymerising fac-
tor [ADF] family). In contrast, protozoan parasites express divergent actins (60%–80% identity

 with vertebrate actins) that typically differ in their ability to form actin filaments. Giardia, try-
panosomid, and apicomplexan actins are refractory to actin polymerisation modulating com-
pounds, such as latruculin, and their structures are difficult to visualise with phalloidin [18–
21]. Similarly, actin 1 of Plasmodium has fundamental shifts in its functional properties:
despite a similar monomer tertiary structure [22] to mammalian actin, Plasmodium actin only
forms short filaments of approximately 100 nm in length, has a noncanonical filament struc-
ture that is dynamically unstable [16,22–28], displays slow polymerisation yet rapid depoly-
merisation rates [29], and is regulated by a highly reduced set of predicted ABPs [30]. Such
altered properties are crucial for intracellular parasite growth [31–33] and efficient parasite
motility [12,31,33–35]. These fundamental differences make Plasmodium actin a useful model
for the comparative assessment of key amino acid residues that result in altered filament prop-
erties. Here, we combined multiscale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with three newly
developed molecular genetic screens to identify the contribution of particular amino acid resi-
dues to the altered properties of canonical rabbit actin and the evolutionarily distant Plasmo-
dium actin 1. The results reveal a distinct region in subdomain 3 as the primary contributor to
divergent actin behaviour and filament incorporation.
Results
Discrete regions of the subunit–subunit interfaces in actin filaments are
divergent between species
Plasmodium actin 1 is one of the most divergent eukaryotic actins known (80% sequence iden-
tity compared to rabbit alpha actin, S1 Fig). To assess the structural and dynamic differences
between actin monomers from parasites, as represented by Plasmodium actin 1, and canonical
mammalian actin monomers, as represented by rabbit actin, we first employed all-atom MD
simulations. Apart from a more flexible region in subdomain 4, comparison of the breathing
dynamics of the actin monomers revealed no marked differences in behaviour between the
actins from the two species (S2 Fig). To assess actin filament dynamics, we constructed 15-mer
Plasmodium and rabbit actin filaments based on electron microscopy (EM) data for the rabbit
alpha actin filament [36] and performed five coarse-grained (CG) MD simulations of 10-μs
duration for each filament. These simulations recapitulated the modified filament architecture
observed in previous EM studies, in terms of alpha angle and subunits per crossover [16,22,27]
(S3 Fig). Moreover, our models allowed for the comparative assessment of the dynamics of the
molecular interactions both within and between subunits in the filaments. Comparison of the
filament models for the two species revealed that both filaments displayed essential common
interaction hot spots in regions involved in intermolecular contacts (Fig 1B–1E). Two interac-
tion regions in subdomains 1 and 3 (designated S1b and S3a) are highly conserved across

as longitudinal and are therefore not displayed. Underlying data can be found in S1 Data. Note that contact sites are similar between
species. Nonetheless, differences in residues between species exist in these regions, as indicated by highlighting by the boxes coloured
by interface region.

 species (over 90% sequence identity of Plasmodium compared to rabbit alpha actin). Other
interaction regions corresponded to sequences in subdomains 2, 3b, and 4 (Fig 1E, overall
sequence identities of 78%, 72%, and 77%, respectively). Interestingly, within these regions
there are residue differences between Plasmodium and rabbit actin filaments and thus altered
contacts between filament subunits (Fig 1E). Thus, whereas the locations of the interfaces are
conserved, the residues are, on average, more divergent at the interfaces than elsewhere (S1
Table).
Specific regions of the parasite actin sequence affect host organ penetration
and efficient motility
We sought to assess the contribution of these divergent regions to the altered behaviour of
actin species in their cellular context. As a first unbiased screen, chimeras containing
exchanges between Plasmodium and mammalian actin were generated and tested for their
ability to replace the endogenous actin 1 gene in the parasite (Fig 2A and 2B). To do so, we
established a two-step genetic methodology that allowed for replacement of the endogenous
copy while leaving the desired locus selection marker free and with minimal flanking changes
in the parasite genome (S4 Fig). For rabbit actin-based chimeras, our screening approach
revealed that any changes to this actin were insufficient to obtain viable parasite lines, strongly
indicating that no one region is capable of full restoration of parasite-like actin function from
a canonical backbone. Even for exchanges introduced into the parasite actin, the majority of
the parasite actin chimeras were unable to functionally replace the endogenous gene. Impor-
tantly, changes to subdomains 2 and 3 of the parasite actin resulted in parasite death, indicat-
ing that these regions provide essential features required for parasite blood stage growth (the
stage at which the genetic manipulations are performed, Fig 2A). Further, mutants with single
point mutations in these subdomains (P42Q and K270M) were also lethal, strongly implicating
Fig 2. Unbiased allelic replacement screen of the Plasmodium endogenous actin 1 locus reveals that swaps of some divergent regions produce
viable blood stage parasites. (A) A simplified schematic overview of the malaria parasite life cycle indicating various forms of the parasite (black) and

 the essentiality of these regions for normal parasite function in the blood stages of infection.
However, two of the most divergent regions could be exchanged with the canonical mamma-
lian actin equivalent regions: an N-terminal domain swap (PbS1aOc, residues 1–33, 67%
sequence identity with rabbit alpha actin with one additional acidic residue on its N-terminus)
and a subdomain 4 replacement (PbS4Oc, residues 182–263, 77% sequence identity with rabbit
alpha actin). Interestingly, these transgenic parasites displayed asexual growth rates in the
blood that were comparable to the wild-type replacement control (Fig 2C), suggesting that
modification of these regions does not significantly affect intracellular growth and erythrocyte
invasion.
The malaria parasite needs to propagate and disseminate in a variety of tissue environments
and different temperatures, suggesting that the required actin dynamics of these other stages
could be different [37,38]. We thus tested if the PbS1aOc and PbS4Oc chimeric lines were
effective in infection of Anopheles mosquitoes. After transmission to the mosquito midgut, the
parasite develops into midgut-penetrating ookinetes, which can traverse the epithelia to estab-
lish oocysts on the basal lamina (Fig 2A). These oocysts produce thousands of sporozoites that
are subsequently released into circulation and actively invade the insect’s salivary glands [7].
PbS1aOc produced slower moving ookinetes and reduced oocyst numbers (Fig 3A and 3B).
Furthermore, while the numbers of sporozoites in the mosquito circulation were within the
usual range, suggesting normal oocyst development, a marked reduction in salivary gland
occupancy and sporozoite motility was observed. PbS1aOc displayed a 50% reduction in para-
site numbers in the salivary glands (Fig 3C). While this line was capable of infecting naive
mice at similar rates to wild-type controls (Fig 3D and 3E) and showed a similar motile popu-
lation compared to wild-type controls (Fig 3F), these parasites moved at a lower average speed
(Fig 3G). Thus, a modification of the N-terminal region of actin, with a concomitant increase
in the number of acidic residues, resulted in a decreased motility of two different parasite
stages, which affected their ability to penetrate the organs of the mosquito.
Alteration of the amino acid residue composition of subdomain 4 (PbS4Oc) resulted in a
much more pronounced defect in salivary gland invasion (Fig 3C). Again, this line was still
able to cause infection in mice by natural mosquito transmission, although the decreased num-
bers of parasites in these glands resulted in a concomitant delay in infection (Fig 3D and 3E).
The motile population of salivary gland–resident parasites was reduced and these moved in a
discontinuous fashion (Fig 3F–3H). Interestingly, these parasites often paused during motility,
a phenomenon not yet described for any Plasmodium mutant (Fig 3H). Intriguingly, such
events were often accompanied by short reversals in direction and detachment at the rear of
the parasite (Fig 3I and 3J, S1 Movie and S2 Movie). While pausing did not change the average
speed compared to wild-type, there was an increased range of speeds obtained by individual
parasites (Fig 3G).
Changing the subdomain 4 region involved the alteration of 20 amino acid residues to
canonical equivalents. Strikingly, the pausing phenotype was also observed by combined mod-
ification of only three residues in this region (three combined parasite to mammalian residue
mutants H195T, G200S, and E232A: mutant HGE/TSA) (Fig 3 and S5 Fig). CG MD simula-
tions with this triple mutant indicate that a change of these three residues results in a shift of
filament parameters toward rabbit actin (S3 Fig) and an atypical interaction profile that is not
observed in either species: residues F54 and Y189 display enhanced contacts with Y170 and
H174, respectively, which could have consequences for actin filament turnover (S6 Fig)
[16,36]. Taken together, altering actin dynamics by mutation of nonessential actin regions
results in parasites that, while behaving normally in the mammalian host, have prominent
inabilities to effectively colonise the mosquito vector.

reduced midgut colonisation of PbS1aOc can be attributed to reduced ookinete speed. PbS1aOc ookinetes (modified N-terminus) show approximately

likely explained by the 10-fold reduction in parasite numbers residing in the glands (see panel c). Thus, fewer parasites would be deposited into the
mammalian host dermis. (E) IV injection (1,000 or 10,000 sporozoites) resulted in an emergence of parasites from the liver at a comparable rate. Because
of a reduced capacity of PbS4Oc to occupy glands, 1,000 sporozoites were injected IV and blood stage parasites emerged in a comparable manner to
wild-type controls. In (D) and (E) data represented as mean ± standard error. (F) Reduction of motility in PbS4Oc and the triple mutant but not

 Overexpression of F-actin binding protein coronin restores parasite
mosquito colonisation in a mutated actin line
Plasmodium actin cannot be visualised using typical imaging approaches [39], yet expressing
the F-actin binding Plasmodium coronin fused with mCherry enabled visualisation of F-actin
in motile sporozoites [37]. Coronin localises at the periphery of nonmotile sporozoites and
relocalises to the rear in motile sporozoites in an actin filament–dependent fashion [37]. To
investigate a possible change in localisation, we transfected PbS4Oc-expressing parasites with
mCherry-tagged coronin under the control of a sporozoite-specific promoter (Fig 4A, S7 Fig).
Curiously, coronin localised to the periphery in an actin-independent manner in these
Fig 4. Coronin displays reduced binding, yet overexpression rescues the PbS4Oc phenotype. (A) Overexpression of actin binding
proteins specifically in the sporozoite stage of the life cycle. (B) Coronin localises at the back of motile wild-type but along the cell
periphery in PbS4Oc sporozoites or sporozoites treated with CD, suggesting reduced efficiency of coronin binding. Red arrowheads
indicate the front of the sporozoites, scale bar: 5 μm. (C–E) Profilin and ADF2 overexpression were unable to restore organ penetration
(c), motility (d), and reduce pausing (e), while coronin overexpression was able to partially rescue the phenotype observed in the PbS4Oc
line. In (C) data represented by mean ± standard error. In (D) black, grey, and white bars: efficiently, partially, and non-motile but

having the intact actin binding domain, ΔC) were unable to rescue the phenotype, suggesting an interplay between N- and C-terminal
regions to mediate rescue. Please note that the wild-type and PbS4Oc data are the same as from Fig 2C, 2F and 2H. Underlying data can

 sporozoites resembling the localisation in nonmotile wild-type sporozoites or after treatment
with the actin filament modulator cytochalasin D (Fig 4B). This indicates that the majority of
the tagged coronin was unable to bind the modified actin, similar to observations with a coro-
nin actin binding mutant and when parasites are treated with filament stabiliser, jasplakinolide
[37]. Intriguingly, overexpression of coronin, but not overexpression of profilin and ADF2,
rescued efficient motility and salivary gland penetration of PbS4Oc sporozoites (Fig 4C–4E).
Overexpression of coronin in WT sporozoites also increased their capacity to move [37], sug-
gesting that in PbS4Oc sporozoites, coronin overexpression is compensating for its reduced
binding ability to a mutated actin. To further probe the domain contributions to this rescue,
we tested whether mutations to coronin would improve motility and invasion of the PbS4Oc
parasite line. Mutations in the N-terminal actin binding domain (coronin mutant R349E,
K350E), as expected, could not rescue the PbS4Oc phenotype. We also tested if the actin bind-
ing N-terminal domain of coronin (residues 1–388, lacking the unique region and coiled-coil
domain), which was shown to bind and bundle actin [40], affected motility and invasion. This
also could not improve the invasion and motility of the PbS4Oc parasite, suggesting a coopera-
tive involvement of both N- and C-terminal regions of coronin in mediating rescue (Fig 4C–
4E).
Exchanging subdomain 3 allows for improved incorporation into parasite
filaments
Above, we identified subdomains 2 and 3 as key contributors to essential processes in
blood stage parasites (Fig 2B). In order to assess the contribution of these regions to altered
actin dynamics, we performed a second screen by expressing these variants (PbS2Oc, OcS2Pb
[residues 34–71], PbS3bOc, and OcS3bPb [residues 264–338]) as mCherry-tagged additional
copies under the control of a sporozoite stage-specific promoter (Fig 5A, S8 Fig and S9 Fig).
This allowed for careful phenotypic characterisation in the parasite without the lethality
observed in the initial screen. Tagged actins revealed interesting differences: an additional
copy of parasite actin was present throughout the parasite cell, as expected [41]. Yet, mamma-
lian actin was only cytoplasmic with a notable absence in the nuclear region (Fig 5B). Further-
more, the two ‘control’ parasite lines (expressing either parasite or canonical actin) differed in
their response to jasplakinolide: parasite mCherry-actin accumulated at both the front and
rear of the cell (Fig 5B), sites implicated for F-actin formation (in the case of formin 1, which
is located at the front; S8 Fig) and turnover (rear) [37,40,41,42]. In contrast, mammalian
mCherry-actin displayed no change in localisation (Fig 5B). This suggests that tagged mamma-
lian actin is not readily incorporated into jasplakinolide-stabilised parasite F-actin in the spo-
rozoite. We next assessed localisation and jasplakinolide responsiveness with the actin
chimeras. Unexpectedly [22], the chimeras containing exchanges in subdomain 2 (a highly
flexible and divergent region between species) were similar in behaviour to their correspond-
ing controls (Fig 5C). In contrast, exchanging subdomain 3 resulted in reciprocal effects: a
mammalian actin containing this corresponding parasite region (residues 264–338 with 21
changes; 72% sequence identity) resulted in a changed localisation under jasplakinolide, thus
suggesting more efficient incorporation to endogenous filaments (Fig 5D). Changing the same
region in the parasite actin resulted in a cellular distribution and jasplakinolide response simi-
lar to mammalian actin, suggesting that subdomain 3 contains the contacts necessary and
sufficient for incorporation into divergent filaments. Importantly, the effect appears to be
independent of the H-plug, as changing the two divergent amino acid residues on the loop
and the two most divergent residues outside this loop back to residues in the canonical actin
(K270M, A272S, E308P, and T315Q) still rendered an additional copy of actin that behaved

 similarly to Plasmodium actin (Fig 5D) [16]. Parasites expressing rabbit actin displayed a 50%
reduction in parasite average speed (Fig 5E). Interestingly, all chimeras of Plasmodium actin
consistently moved with a slightly higher average speed compared to their corresponding
mammalian chimeras. OcS3bPb, the only mammalian actin chimera that responded to jaspla-
kinolide treatment, moved at a similar speed to the wild-type Plasmodium actin control
(Fig 5E).

gave a rabbit actin-like localisation pattern. This change in localisation was not solely dependent on amino acid changes in the H-loop and the most divergent
residues elsewhere in the region because a protein containing these changes between species (KAET/MSPQ) resembled the wild-type parasite equivalent. Scale

 Actin subdomains 2 and 3 contribute to efficient parasite monomer
incorporation in highly divergent cell systems
To test whether the specific regions that we identified above are common contributors to actin
dynamics in other cell types, we performed a third screen by transfecting the panel of chimeras
into different mammalian cells as additional copies. Higher eukaryotic cells did not readily incor-
porate parasite actin into stable filamentous structures (Fig 6A and 6B, S10 Fig). Furthermore,
cells containing parasite actin moved slightly faster in a random migration assay (Fig 6C). These
observations indicate that malaria parasite actin can be used as a template to identify the minimum
determinants required for filament incorporation in higher eukaryotic cells. Strikingly, changing
subdomain 2 or 3 into the corresponding mammalian equivalent resulted in the parasite GFP-
actin more readily incorporating into filament networks (Fig 6A and 6B). In contrast, exchanging
individual regions of mammalian actin did not result in decreased incorporation, suggesting that
more than one region can provide the required minimal contacts necessary for incorporation.
To identify key amino acid residues contributing to filament incorporation, multiple muta-
tions (whereby parasite actin residues were converted to conserved mammalian counterparts)
in both subdomain 2 and subdomain 3 were generated and analysed (Fig 6A and 6B). Consis-
tent with the results of the parasite lines, single and multiple mutations of both the H-plug and
regions typically on the surface of the actin filament in subdomain 3 did not result in improved
filament incorporation, suggesting an extensive interface in the subdomain 3 region required
for incorporation. Remarkably, a single residue change (N41H) in subdomain 2 of Plasmo-
dium actin was sufficient to rescue filament incorporation (Fig 6A and 6B). This indicates that
the presence of an imidazole group alone provides sufficient interaction for more efficient fila-
ment incorporation (Fig 6A and 6B). Thus, crucial differences between actin species, including
the ability for a monomer to incorporate into divergent filaments, are due to the changes in
particular divergent regions in specific subdomains only. Furthermore, subdomain 3 is the key
common contributor to filament incorporation in two very diverse cellular systems.
Discussion
Differential functional requirements of Plasmodium and mammalian actin
While, structurally, the Plasmodium actin 1 monomer is similar to that of canonical mamma-
lian actins [22], Plasmodium actin filaments are shorter and more dynamic [22,26,27]. Here,
we have shown that Plasmodium actin is unable to efficiently incorporate into actin filaments
of mammalian cells and that tagged mammalian and Plasmodium actin localise differently in
parasites. Using MD simulations as well as chimeric and mutagenesis genetic screens, we iden-
tified the fundamental contributors that underlie these different characteristics. Our data inde-
pendently confirm that these two actins occupy a similar structural space and identify
divergent amino acid residues responsible for the differences in filament dynamics. Plasmo-
dium was unable to tolerate allelic changes in subdomains 2 and 3, suggesting that these
regions have crucial features required for parasite biology and are, particularly P42 and the H-
plug, key contributors to contact sites. The data suggest that modifications of these two regions
result in filaments that are too stable and thus lethal for the parasite, similar to the effects
observed with jasplakinolide treatment or genetic ablation of the actin regulator, ADF1, and
the alpha capping protein [31,32,43,44].
Strong selection pressure on parasite actin in the mosquito
Unlike exchanges in subdomains 2 and 3, the parasite readily tolerated the exchange of highly
divergent regions of subdomain 4 and the N-terminal residues (Fig 2). These parasite lines

 grew like wild-type parasites in the blood stage and were only affected in their progression in
the mosquito host (Fig 3). Importantly, this indicates that red blood cell invasion, while depen-
dent on actin [33], is more tolerant of minor changes to its sequence. This observation is con-
sistent with ablating ABP expression having little effect on the parasite in the mammalian host
but having a strong effect once the parasite infects the insect vector [37,44–48]. While other
studies looked indirectly with actin regulators, our study investigated the core of the machin-
ery itself across the life cycle, revealing that modest changes to dynamics have important con-
sequences in mosquito colonisation. This indicates that the greatest selection pressure on the
parasite actin sequence could be during active organ penetration of the mosquito.
Changes to the N-terminal sequence resulted in a consistent decrease in speed between the
two parasite stages that employ gliding motility in the mosquito (Fig 3B and 3G). Given the
well-known interaction between the actin N-terminus and myosin [49–56], it is reasonable to
suggest that the decrease in cell speed is due to a reduced interaction between these two pro-
teins. We thus propose that parasites containing this change in acidic residue content have
reduced force transmission of actomyosin, which results in reduced average speeds. This
hypothesis could be probed in vitro using classical myosin sliding filament assays with the
respective Plasmodium machinery components [57].
Previous studies in yeast have indicated a relatively low threshold in opisthokonts to accom-
modate changes to its actin subdomain 1 sequence, in which the addition of a single acidic res-
idue to the N-terminus rendered viable yet sick yeast cells, while two additional acidic residues
were lethal for the cell [58]. In comparison, the addition of another acidic residue to parasite
actin was surprisingly well tolerated (Figs 2 and 3): these parasites could complete the life cycle
and move sufficiently well to cause infection (albeit at a lower overall efficiency in the mos-
quito). Interestingly, yeast cells with changes to subdomain 1 and the N-terminus were sensi-
tive to changes in growth temperature [58–61]. Given the marked differences in body
temperatures between mosquito and mammal, it is possible that changes in parasite actin
sequence affect the well-tuned actin dynamics required at different temperatures. In vitro poly-
merisation assays with these mutants at both 37˚C and 21˚C would provide important insights
into differences in the polymerisation kinetics at different temperatures. These detailed kinetic
studies are especially interesting given that hybrid actins between rabbit muscle and yeast
equivalents can produce unexpected changes to certain biochemical properties [58].
Rapid filament recycling and continuous parasite movement
Interestingly, modifications of three amino acid residues in subdomain 4 rendered a parasite
that frequently paused and reversed direction during migration (Fig 3H–3J). We propose that
this change in motility is due to more stable actin filaments, which might be misoriented and
hence allow partial rearward motility. Similar movements can be observed if Toxoplasma para-
sites are treated with high concentrations of jasplakinolide, a filament-stabilising drug [62].
We showed previously that coronin can bind to actin filaments in motile sporozoites but not
to those treated with jasplakinolide [37]. Intriguingly, in the PbS4Oc sporozoites, coronin did
not bind actin filaments and hence this parasite to some extent phenocopies jasplakinolide
treatment. These parasites could also not enter salivary glands efficiently, for which well-
tuned actin dynamics are important [37,45]. Yet, overexpression of coronin rescued both
motility and invasion phenotypes (Fig 4). This indicates a central role for coronin in rapid fila-
ment recycling in the highly motile parasite. We propose that the discontinuous movements in
subdomain 4 mutants (PbS4Oc and HGE/TSA) result from reduced actin filament recycling
due to altered architecture and interactions at the filament interface, particularly by enhanced
interactions of F54 and Y189. By alteration of subdomain 4 residues, the resulting contacts by

 conserved amino acid residues render the parasite actin filament less prone to disassembly as
choreographed by coronin (S11 Fig).
Reduced invasion and aberrant motility were only rescued by full-length coronin, while
mutated or truncated coronins were insufficient to rescue these phenotypes. This may suggest
a cooperative requirement of the coronin domains for actin turnover (Fig 4C–4E). This result
was somewhat surprising, because a recent publication on the biochemical properties of P. fal-
ciparum coronin suggested that much of the classical coronin function could be carried out by
the N-terminal actin binding domain alone [40]. Our work indicates that, in the context of the
P. berghei actin mutated sporozoite, both regions of coronin are required for full functionality.
The mechanism by which coronin could be mediating Plasmodium filament recycling could
be similar to that in higher eukaryotes. In these, coronin mediates a spatial-temporal recruit-
ment of other filament regulators [63–65]. Coronin binds first and, depending on the nucleo-
tide state of the actin [63,66], can serve to shield or allow access of ADFs to the filament.
Binding of these additional factors together results in destabilisation of the filament. Given the
close proximity of coronin and ADF on canonical filaments, it was also suggested that coronin
could interact directly with ADF in the filament [64–67]. It is tempting to speculate that the
rescue mediated by coronin could be due to a stepwise recruitment by coronin, with depoly-
merisation factors on the highly dynamic Plasmodium actin filament, which thus enhances
severing. Our rescue experiments thus hint at a possibly conserved spatial-temporal coronin
mechanism for filament regulation beyond what has currently been demonstrated for
opisthokonts.
The C-terminal region of coronin appears important for this rescue, which suggests that
this domain could allow for an interaction with other ABPs [68]. Indeed, it has been suggested
for coronin of the related parasite T. gondii that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain could func-
tion as a molecular recruitment hub [69]. Alternatively, the C-terminal region simply provides
an improved interaction with the filament, resulting in efficient turnover in the parasite.
Together, our observations suggest interplay between both halves of Plasmodium coronin to
mediate efficient rescue in motile sporozoites.
In vivo screens reveal actin dynamics dependent on typically non-
interfacial residues
A recent high-resolution cryo-EM structure of the jasplakinolide-stabilised Plasmodium actin
filament [16] is in good agreement with our models and generally fits with our biological
observations. However, some of our in vivo observations could not be directly inferred from
the static structure. For example, the combined mutation of H195 and G200 (to Thr and Ser,
respectively) at a lateral interface in Plasmodium actin had no significant effect on the parasite
across the entire complex life cycle. A third residue, E232, which is not at an interface, with the
exception of one published structure [70], needed to be mutated in order for an effect on para-
site biology to be observed, suggesting a dynamic interplay across several residues in this
region (Fig 3C–3H). It is possible that E232 could provide a compensatory interaction when
H195 and G200 are mutated. Our systematic approach, which spans from molecular models to
cells, has thus identified novel cooperative interactions within actin filaments (Fig 7).
Parasite actin provides molecular insights into monomer-to-filament
incorporation
In this study, we made use of additional copy expression systems in highly divergent cells. It is
important to note that these assays can only provide insights into monomer incorporation
into filaments. Thus, we can make no direct inferences regarding whether each actin mutant,

 if present as the primary untagged actin in the cell, can fully complement wild-type function.
For example, PbS2Oc was lethal as a replacement yet behaved similarly to wild-type Plasmo-
dium actin as an additional copy in the parasite (Fig 5). Newly available genetic tools, such as
inducible knockout systems [33], might be adapted to probe these otherwise lethal mutants for
their functional consequences in cells.
Our observation that parasite actin does not efficiently incorporate into the mammalian
cell actin network provided a useful tool in understanding the minimal requirements for net-
work incorporation. Interestingly, subdomain 4 conversion of parasite actin did not improve
network incorporation efficiency, while changing subdomain 2 or 3 resulted in a considerable
incorporation into filamentous structures. Subdomain 2, with its highly dynamic extendibility,
has been implicated to act as the primary interaction arm, after initial contact by subdomain 4,
to allow the incoming monomer to bind to the barbed end [36]. The N41H mutant in Plasmo-
dium actin subdomain 2 alone shows improved incorporation into mammalian actin fila-
ments. Histidine has the capacity to have more contacts than asparagine and thus this position
might be the key prominent interaction to allow optimal contact with the filament [16] (Fig
1E). Indeed, oxidation of H40 results in an actin monomer that is unable to polymerise
[71,72]. Here, we extend this understanding to include this contact as important for an incom-
ing monomer to dock onto a filament. We, with others, have shown that subdomain 3 provides
important contact sites across the strand once the monomer has been incorporated and also
for the incoming monomer to be included in the filament [15,36,73] (Fig 1 and Fig 7). Further-
more, we cannot exclude that subdomain 3 could be providing the required contact interface
Fig 7. Specific regions of actin are primarily responsible for the differences between actins from Plasmodium and
mammals. Residues or regions with blue labels correspond to contributors to filament stability, while red labels
indicate contributors to incorporation of monomers into divergent filaments. In both cases, subdomain 3 (residues
264–338) is a critical contributor and allowed for divergent monomers to be reciprocally incorporated. Importantly, a
change of a single amino acid residue (N41H) allowed for improved incorporation of Plasmodium actin into
mammalian filaments. Dotted lines indicate the wild-type filament assembly and disassembly. For simplicity, we have
only represented barbed end addition and pointed end dissociation. The lethal phenotypes of the S2 and S3b chimeras
suggest that these regions also contribute to filament stability, similarly to the HGE/TSA mutant.

 to allow for increased ABP-mediated incorporation [74]. We propose that having at least one
of these important subdomain sites (2 or 3b) is sufficient for effective incorporation in higher
eukaryotic cells. Identification of altered ABP binding between actin species could shed light
on the primary factors responsible for monomer incorporation. Notably, there is a consistent
feature between divergent systems: alteration of subdomain 3 allowed for a mammalian equiv-
alent to be more efficiently incorporated into the highly divergent parasite cytoskeleton, indi-
cating that this region could be a common ‘site of recognition’ across differently behaving
actin species. This could be tested with other highly divergent actins to assess whether this
region acts as a common recognition point across species.
Conclusion
Through our comparative approaches, we have identified essential contributors to the differential
behaviour of two highly divergent actin species (Fig 7). We have identified a region of subdomain
3 outside the H-plug as providing important contacts to allow an otherwise divergent actin to be
more efficiently incorporated into canonical actin filaments, thus enhancing our molecular under-
standing of the dynamic space required for filament incorporation. We show that a deeper under-
standing of Plasmodium actin dynamics sheds light on the fundamental properties of the actin
polymer across eukaryotes. Such findings provide insights into the structural space required for
actin subunits to assemble in order to meet the diverse needs for filament dynamics of different
cells, ranging from protozoan parasites through to classical mammalian systems.

Preparation of structures.
Coordinates of the P. falciparum actin 1 structure (PDB ID:
4CBU, 1.3 Å resolution) [22] were retrieved from the RCSB-protein data bank [75]. In this
structure, the coordinates of chain G (gelsolin, water, and Ca2+) were deleted. The remaining
structure, i.e., chain A, consisting of P. falciparum actin 1 (Q7-S366) complexed with ATP,
Ca2+, and water molecules, was further prepared using the Protein Preparation Wizard of the
Schrodinger software (version 2016r1). The co-crystallised Ca2+ ion was replaced with Mg2+
and co-crystallised waters were retained. The protonation of the titratable residues at pH 7 was
predicted using PROPKA [76]. The missing loop region (G43-E50) residues were modeled
using the Prime module of the Schrodinger software. Residue V11 was mutated to I11 in Mae-
stro to give the P. berghei actin 1 sequence. Similarly, the structure of rabbit muscle alpha actin
complexed with gelsolin (PDB ID: 1EQY) [77] was downloaded from the RCSB-PDB. The
coordinates for the gelsolin chain were deleted and the remaining structure was prepared as
described above for Plasmodium actin 1.
All-atom MD simulations.
The structures were prepared for all-atom MD simulations
using the tleap program in the AMBER MD package version 14 (http://ambermd.org/). GAFF
and ff14SB force fields were used to assign parameters to the ligand and protein, respectively
[78]. The parameters for ATP were retrieved from the AMBER parameter database (http://
research.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/bryce/amber) [79]. Each system was solvated in a truncated

 octahedral box using the TIP3P water model [80]. An ionic strength of 50 mM was modelled
by the addition of K+ and Cl− ions, and the systems were neutralised with Na+ counterions.
The systems were then energy minimised as follows. Firstly, a restrained energy minimisa-
tion (force-constant = 100 kcal/mol Å2 on the protein and the ligand) with an initial 500 steps
using steepest descent, followed by 500 steps using conjugate gradient minimisation, was per-
formed. Then, a restraint-free all-atom energy minimisation was carried out for 1,500 steps
using steepest descent, followed by 1,000 steps using conjugate gradient minimisation. Non-
bonded interactions were cut off at 8 Å and a particle-mesh Ewald treatment was applied.
The energy minimised systems were gradually heated (0 to 298 K in 80 ps) using the canon-
ical ensemble (NVT). These systems were next equilibrated in an isothermal–isobaric ensem-
ble (NPT) at 298 K. Berendsen temperature coupling and a constant pressure of 1 atm with
isotropic molecule-based scaling was used in the equilibration. All covalent bonds to hydrogen
atoms were constrained using the SHAKE algorithm and a time step of 2 fs was used through-
out the simulation [81]. All production simulations were performed in periodic boundary con-
ditions (PBCs) in the NPT ensemble for a duration of 300 ns.
The MD trajectories were analyzed using the CPPTRAJ module of AMBER14 [82] and
VMD (www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/)[83]. Pymol (version 1.8.2.3) (https://pymol.org/)
and VMD (version 1.9.2) were used for visualisation.
Filament construction and dynamics.
In this study, we built a rabbit (Rb) actin (Uniprot
Id: P68135) filament structure based on the model derived from cryo-electron microscopy
data at 3.6 Å resolution (PDB ID: 5JLF) of 5 protomers [15]. We built a structure of a 15 proto-
mer–long actin filament by superimposition of the first protomer onto the fourth protomer of
the 5JLF structure to cover the twisted double strand with a length of a half pitch, which has
13.5 protomers. We built 15-mer actin filament models for wild-type P. berghei (Pb) (Uniprot
Id: Q4Z1L3), the Pb H195T/G200S/E232A triple mutant, and the Pb H195T, G200S, E232A,
and N41H single mutants, using the Rb actin filament as a template structure. We used Model-
ler 9v10 software to build these homology models.
To reduce the high computational cost and maintain calculation accuracy, we performed
MD simulations with the MARTINI CG force field [84] with the GROMACS 5.0.7 package
[85]. All seven actin filament structures were mapped to a CG model with MARTINI version
2.2. In order to maintain the secondary and tertiary structures of the actin protein during the
CG MD simulation, intramolecular harmonic restraints were applied to the backbone atoms
of the protein with an elastic force constant of 500 kJ.mol−1. nm−2 and a distance cutoff of 5–9
Å (lower and upper limits). The secondary structure information was generated using DSSP
version 2002 (https://swift.cmbi.umcn.nl/gv/dssp/). After mapping, we constructed simulation
systems for each structure, all of which were immersed in a saline solution with
box dimensions of 15 nm × 15 nm × 54 nm. The saline solution consisted of MARTINI non-
polarisable water molecules with randomly placed Na+ and Cl− ions to neutralise the system,
and the salt concentration was set to 50 mM to mimic experimental conditions. We performed
energy minimisation with the steepest descent algorithm for 10,000 steps to remove bad con-
tacts and to build a reasonable starting structure. Subsequently, the temperature (300 K) and
pressure (1 bar) of the system were equilibrated with a short MD simulation using a leap-frog
algorithm with PBC and a 20 fs time step. A short equilibration CG MD simulation for 20 ns
was performed in the NVT ensemble, followed by 20 ns of equilibration in the NPT ensemble
with Berendsen pressure coupling. Finally, a 10 μs–long production MD simulation was per-
formed with the NPT ensemble and Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling. The trajectory of
atomic positions and energies was saved every 1 ns. All systems were simulated at least in
duplicate. We excluded the ADP cofactor and Mg2+ ion from CG MD simulations, as CG
parameters for ADP, Mg2+ ion, and methylated histidine are not available. We used a standard

 histidine instead of methylated histidine (which was only present in Rb actin). The ADP cofac-
tor and Mg2+ ion are buried in the protein. Methylated histidine points towards the surface of
the protomer and does not have interactions with other residues/protomer. Therefore, we
expect these omissions to have no/minimal impact on the overall architecture of the actin fila-
ment during CG MD simulations.
Computational analysis of filament inter-subunit properties.
To analyse inter-subunit
differences between canonical Rb, Pb, and Pb mutant actin filaments, we computed the num-
ber of lateral (ith subunit with i+1th subunit) and longitudinal (ith subunit with i+2th subunit)
residue–residue contacts between each neigbouring subunit across the 15-mer filament
(chains A to O) using a bead–bead contact threshold of 5 Å for each snapshot of all replica CG
MD trajectories across each of the actin filament species. To eliminate possible artefacts arising
from finite-size filament effects, the terminal four subunits at each end of the filament were
excluded from the analysis. The mean number of residue–residue contacts across all mid-fila-
ment subunits (chains E-K), snapshots, and replica production trajectories for each species
was then calculated in terms of a pairwise residue contact map (S6 Fig). The overall contact
contribution of a given residue to its lateral or longitudinal subunit (mean residue–subunit
contacts) was finally computed by integrating over the corresponding pairwise residue–residue
contacts. Analyses were performed using the software packages VMD1.9 and MATLAB. Vari-
ous architectural properties, such as the angle of rotation (alpha angle), the axial separation of
the protomers (h), the protomers per pitch in the genetic helix, and the protomers per half
pitch in the double helix [27], were also calculated (S3 Fig).
Parasitology methods
Animals.
For all experiments, female 4–6-wk-old NMRI (for parasite propagation, blood
stage growth rate assays, and mosquito feeds) and C57Bl/6 (for transmission studies) mice
were used (obtained from Janvier Laboratories). A. stephensi mosquitoes were reared and
maintained by standard breeding methods.
Generation of chimeric or mutant parasite lines.
Transfection vectors were generated
using standard molecular biology techniques. For the generation of a recipient line, the endog-
enous actin 1 gene containing silent restriction sites to facilitate subdomain exchanges were
ordered from GeneArt (Invitrogen Corp) and cloned into the Pb238 vector [86,87] with
BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. The actin 50 untranslated region (UTR) was amplified using
primers 1 and 2 and cloned into the vector using restriction enzymes SalI and XbaI (all
enzymes purchased from New England Biolabs). The flanking actin 30 UTR was amplified
using primers 3 and 4 and cloned into the transfection vector via AvrII and KpnI restriction
sites. The 30 UTR of dihydrofolate synthase (dhfs) was cloned from another vector [87] into the
downstream region of the actin ORF using BamHI and EcoRV restriction enzymes. Finally the
positive-negative selection cassette hdhfr-yfcu (standing for human dihydrofolate reductase,
yeast cytosine deaminase and uridyl phosphoribosyl transferase fusion enzyme) [88] replaced
the original selection cassette using primers 5 and 6 and restriction enzymes EcoRV and AvrII.
Linearisation of the construct was achieved through SalI and PmeI digestion, followed by
DNA isolation using ethanol precipitation. Transfections were then performed as described
previously [89,90] and positively selected using pyrimethamine (0.07 mg/mL) to yield a recipi-
ent line. All lines generated in this study were performed in the P. berghei ANKA background
[91]. A clonal parasite from the transfection mixture of integrants and resistant wild-type was
obtained by limiting dilution.
Actin 1 ORF replacement constructs were generated using the same starting Pb238 vector.

 sequence was modified to result in the same protein sequence but with reduced homology,
and the other Oryctolagus cuniculus alpha skeletal muscle actin) were ordered from GeneArt,
as above. Subdomains were exchanged by restriction digestion (of engineered silent codon
changes) and ligation between their original sequencing vectors as follows: subdomain 1a
AatII and BamHI, subdomain 2 AatII and NruI, subdomain 3b AfeI and ClaI, subdomain 4
FseI and AfeI. These chimeras were cloned into an intermediate Pb238 replacement vector
(containing the actin 50 and 30 UTR flanking the ORF, the 30 UTR replaced the dhfs 30 UTR
using primers 7 and 8) via BamHI and XbaI restriction sites. The transfection construct was
linearised with SalI and PmlI, transfected as above, and integration selected by negative selec-
tion using 5-fluorocytosine (1 mg/mL in drinking water) [92]. This rendered a line free of the
selection cassette and contained the desired change in actin sequence. Blood stage parasites
were monitored by smearing a drop of tail blood and staining with Giemsa solution (Merck).
Calculation of blood stage growth rates were performed post-limiting dilution, assuming a sin-
gle parasite was injected per positive mouse, as described previously [93].
For ABPs in the wild-type or PbS4Oc backgrounds, Plasmodium profilin, and coronin-
mCherry constructs (full-length and actin binding mutant K349E,R350E), both under the spo-
rozoite specific ‘up-regulated in infective sporozoites 3’ (uis3) promoter, were bulk prepared
for transfection and linearised as previously described [37,38]. A C-terminally truncated coro-
nin (expressing a construct with residues 1–388) was generated and amplified with primers 9
and 10, cloned into the nb3D+ vector using NotI and XbaI restriction sites, and linearised as
above. mCherry-ADF2 under the uis3 promoter was amplified using primers 11 and 12 and
cloned into the starting Pb238 vector containing the uis3 promoter and mCherry with NotI
and SpeI restriction enzymes. This construct was linearised with NdeI. Transfections were per-
formed and were selected with pyrimethamine as above.
For additional copy construct generation, the Pb238 vector containing homology arms for
chromosome 12 [86,93] and the actin genes was reemployed. The uis3 promoter was amplified
with primers 13 and 14 and cloned into the vector using SacII and NotI enzymes. mCherry
was amplified with primers 15 and 16 and cloned with restriction enzymes NotI and XbaI. The
gene design also included a 10–amino acid alanine linker (AAAASRAAAA) in frame between
the mCherry and actin ORFs. All chimeras were then cloned into Pb238 using XbaI and
BamHI restriction sites. Note that this original vector already contained the downstream dhfs
30 UTR and selection cassette. The transfection constructs were linearised with PvuI, trans-
fected as above, integration was selected for with pyrimethamine and confirmed by genotyp-
ing, and clonal lines were obtained by limiting dilution.
In order to generate the endogenous reversibly switchable enhanced GFP (rseGFP) Formin
1 (PBANKA_1245300) tag, the PlasmoGEM system was used. The intermediate stage tagging
vector PbGEM-int-309594 was ordered from PlasmoGEM. Also, the recombination vector
GW R6K Emerald was used. The coding region of rseGFP (vector pQE31, a kind gift of
Mhlanga lab) was amplified with primers 17 and 18 and cloned with SacII and ApaI into the
GW R6K Emerald vector, replacing the coding region of Emerald with rseGFP. The ligated
vector was transformed into pir1 cells and the rseGFP sequenced. Using the Gateway reaction,
the GW R6K vector and the intermediate vector PbGEM-int-309594 were combined and
transformed into TSA cells. Essentially recommended protocols from the PlasmoGEM
website were used (http://plasmogem.sanger.ac.uk/static/supporting_pdfs/Small_Scale_
Recombineering_and_Gateway_protocol_WTAC_Mal_Exp_Gen_2013.pdf). The GW R6K
rseGFP plasmid was supplied to the PlasmoGEM team and can be requested.

 naïve recipient mouse. Three days post-transfer, exflagellation was assessed by incubation of a
drop of tail blood for 10 min at 20˚C. Exflagellation centres were observed by light microscopy
(Carl Zeiss GmBH, Jena, Germany). In the event that >1 centre/field of view was observed,
whole blood (approximately 1 mL) was mixed with 12 mL complete ookinete medium (RPMI-
1640, 25 mM Hepes, 300 mg/L L-glutamine, 10 mg/L hypoxanthine, 50,000 units/L penicillin,
50 mg/L streptomycin, 2 g/L NaHCO3, 20.48 mg/L xanthurenic acid, 20% foetal bovine serum
[FBS], pH 7.8) and incubated for 20 h at 19˚C. Non-ookinete material was depleted by centri-
fugation on a 63% nycodenz cushion (in phosphate buffered saline [PBS], 1,000 rpm, no
brake), and the ookinete mixture was pipetted from the interface and pelleted by centrifuga-
tion at 1,000 rpm for 8 min. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of FBS-free ookinete medium.
For motility assays, 200 μL of ookinetes was briefly centrifuged to further concentrate the para-
sites and resuspended in 20 μL of medium. Approximately 4–6 μL of this concentrate was
added to a microscope slide and sealed with a coverslip. Imaging was performed on a Zeiss
Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss GmBH, Jena, Germany) and images
acquired every 20 s for 15 min (DIC exposure time 150 ms). Average speeds were calculated
using the ImageJ Manual Tracking plug-in.
Infection of A. stephensi mosquitoes and characterisation of mosquito parasite stages.
A donor mouse was infected by intraperitoneal injection of a frozen parasite stock. Four to five
days postinfection, approximately 20 million parasites were transferred to two recipient naïve
mice. Transmission ability was assessed by exflagellation observation using the procedure and
criteria described above. Prior to feeding, mosquitoes were starved for 4–6 h. Infected recipient
mice were anaesthetised with a ketamine/xylazine mixture (87.5 mg/kg ketamine, 12.5 mg/kg
xylazine) and placed on top of the mosquito cage for approximately 30 min to allow for suffi-
cient insect feeding. Infected mosquitoes were maintained at 21˚C and 80% humidity until
analysis.
For quantification of midgut oocyst numbers, 20–30 midguts were isolated by dissection on
day 12 postinfection. Freshly isolated midguts were fixed in 1% NP-40 and subsequently
stained with 0.1% mercurochrome in PBS for 30 min. Stained organs were mounted in a mini-
mal amount of PBS, covered with a coverslip, and counted using a 10× objective on a Zeiss
Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope. To assess salivary gland invasion rates, salivary
glands and midguts of 20–30 mosquitoes were obtained on day 19 postinfection and trans-
ferred to 50 μL RMPI-1640 (supplemented with 50,000 units.l−1 penicillin and 50 mg.l−1 strep-
tomycin) on ice. Organs were crushed for 1 min using a plastic pestle and typically diluted 1:2
for salivary gland homogenates or 1:5 for midgut preparations. Samples were then loaded into
a Neubauer counting chamber and final counts normalised to sporozoites per mosquito. Spo-
rozoite motility assays were performed on freshly dissected salivary glands, whereby organs
were isolated and crushed, as above. Parasites were then purified from mosquito debris by cen-
trifugation at 2,500g for 20 min on a 17% accudenz cushion [94]. Sporozoites at the interface
were collected by pipetting, recentrifuged at maximum speed on a benchtop centrifuge, and
activated by resuspension in 100 μL of 3% BSA in RPMI-1640 medium. This solution was
transferred to a 96-well optical bottom plate (Nunc) and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 3 min to
mediate parasite attachment to the plate bottom. Sporozoites were imaged using a 25× objec-
tive on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M fluorescence microscope (DIC channel, 150-ms exposure time,
frame rate: 1 frame/1.5 s). Average speeds were calculated using the ImageJ Manual Tracking
plugin. Sporozoites were classed as continuously moving if parasites moved continuously for
at least 75 s with no more than a 15 s halt in motility. Partially moving sporozoites were classed
as such if these cells moved more than one parasite length but did not fulfill the criteria of con-
tinuous motility. Attached parasites were clearly attached to the surface but did not move
more than one parasite length (or did not move productively at all). Parasites were considered

 to have paused if, in the case of a continuous or partial moving sporozoite, there was no dis-
cernible movement for three or more three frames (>4.5 s) or upon observation of a parasite
briefly reversing. For localisation studies of additional copy parasite lines, parasites were
imaged with a 63× objective using the same setup as above (mCherry channel λex 546 nm, λem
575 nm, 25% filter, exposure 200 ms; DIC 150 ms). Comparison between parasite lines
expressing Plasmodium actin from the UIS3 and actin promoters was performed using the
mCherry channel (except using no extra filter and 300 ms exposure). Formin 1 localisation
was assessed using dual lasers (405 nm and 488 nm) to switch the GFP to an active state and
was imaged with a Nikon Ti series spinning disc confocal microscope (60× objective). For
actin modulating compound response studies, after motility assay, imaging sporozoites were
treated with either jasplakinolide or cytochalasin D (Sigma Aldrich), the solution mixed by
gently pipetting, and the 96-well plate re-centrifuged. Imaging was performed as above. All
images were processed in FIJI [95]. Parasite transmission studies back into naïve mice were
performed as described previously [93]. Given the reduced numbers of salivary gland–resident
parasites in the PbS4Oc line, 1,000 sporozoites were injected IV and thus had an appropriate
control dose group.
Mammalian cell biology methods.
Actin ORFs were amplified from starting vectors
using primers 19 and 20 (for Plasmodium actin 1 backbones) or 21 and 22 (for O. cuniculus
beta actin backbones), digested with BamHI and XbaI, and cloned in frame with eGFP (with a
22–amino acid linker) in vector pEGFP-C1 (Clontech, Takara Bio Co., USA) using the same
restriction enzymes. All constructs were confirmed by sequencing before transfection.
All media components were purchased from ThermoFisher (Gibco, USA). B16-F1 cells
(ECACC 92101203) were maintained in DMEM, 10% FBS, and 2 mM L-Glutamine and Chi-
nese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO-K1, ATCC CCL-61) were maintained in DMEM/F-12 supple-
mented with FBS and L-Glutamine, as above. Cells were plated one day prior to transfection
such that the wells in a 24-well plate had a confluency of 70%–80%. Cells were transfected with
0.5–1 μg of plasmid DNA in duplicate in a 24-well plate using the Lipofectamine 2000 transfec-
tion reagent according to the manufacturers protocol (ThermoFisher). Twenty-one hours
post-transfection, cells were lifted with trypsin-EDTA and approximately 15,000 B16-F1 cells
or 30,000 CHO-K1 cells transferred to a new 24-well plate containing an acid-washed and pro-
tein-treated (for B16-F1 cells: 25 μg/mL laminin [Sigma-Aldrich]; for CHO-K1 cells: 50 μg/mL
fibronectin [Sigma-Aldrich]) coverslip in 500 μL pre-warmed medium. Cells were allowed to
settle for 3 h, were washed with 1 mL pre-warmed 1×PBS, and fixed with 500 μL 4% PFA, pH
7.4, for 15 min. Samples were washed three times with 1×PBS to remove fixative and subse-
quently incubated with 100 nM TRITC-phalloidin (Sigma) in 1×PBS. Staining mixture was
removed, the samples washed three times, as before, and coverslips mounted in Mowiol 4–88
(Sigma). The mounted coverslips were allowed to set overnight at room temperature and
stored at 4˚C. For transfection and subsequent quantification, the experimenter was blinded to
all sample identities. Images were acquired with the Zeiss Axiovert 200M (GFP channel λex
450 nm, λem 515 nm, exposure 200 ms, rhodamine channel λex 546 nm, λem 575 nm, exposure
200 ms). Approximately 30–50 cells were counted per transfection and all transfections per-
formed at least three times (thus, >100 cells were characterised per condition). Cells that con-
tained a GFP-positive actin network, as identified by phalloidin staining, were classed as
positive for filament incorporation, whereas GFP expressing cells without observable co-locali-
sation with phalloidin staining were classified as negative.
For B16-F1 cell motility assays, cell preparation and transfections were performed as above.
After cells settled (approximately 24 h post-transfection), multiple GFP positive cells were
imaged for 6–8 h in an environmentally controlled chamber of a Nikon Ti series spinning disc
confocal microscope. Images were acquired using a 20× objective every 10 min and average

and SD4: residues 180–219, 252–262. Scissor angle is the angle calculated as dot product
between the two vectors drawn from centre of mass of C-alpha atoms of SD2 to SD1 residues
and from centre of mass of C-alpha atoms of SD3 to SD4 residues. Dihedral angle is defined as
dihedral angle between centre of mass of C-alpha atoms of SD2-SD1-SD3-SD4 residues.
Clamp-mouth is the distance between C-alpha atoms of residue Q59 and E207. Clamp is the

S3 Fig. General structural parameters of average rotational angle between subunits (alpha
angle) and subunits per half-pitch for the double helix computed from CG MD simula-
tions correspond to previously published EM structures. α-angle values for Rabbit and Plas-
modium falciparum actin filaments reported for cryo-EM structures are 166.9˚ (EMD-8162)
and 167.5˚ (EMD-2572 and EMD-3805), respectively, and corresponding number of subunits
per half-pitch for the double helix are 13.74 and 14.42, respectively. Results from our CG MD
simulations sufficiently explained the difference of around 1 subunit per half-pitch for the dou-
ble helix with 12.89 and 13.98 subunits for Rabbit and P. berghei, respectively. P. berghei subdo-
main 4 triple mutant (H195T, G200S, and E232A, see Fig 2) displays parameters (subunits per
half-pitch for the double helix = 12.71) similar to rabbit actin (Oryctolagus cuniculus). The data
presented here were obtained from stable trajectories (4–10 μs, based on filament RMSD val-
ues observed during CG MD simulation) of multiple CG MD simulations for each filament
model. Analysis was performed on the middle chunk of filament—that is, the middle 7 sub-
units of filament structure, excluding 4 subunits on each terminal. The calculated α-angle val-
ues with standard deviation for Rabbit, P. berghei, and P. berghei HGE/TSA triple mutant are
166.04 ± 10.04, 167.12 ± 8.67, and 165.84 ± 10.69, respectively. The number of subunits per
half-pitch for the double helix was calculated using average alpha angle value. Underlying data

 S4 Fig. A novel ‘gene-in marker-out’ screening strategy for the allelic replacement of the
endogenous actin 1 gene with chimeras and mutants. (A) A linear construct containing a dif-
ferent 30 UTR (dhfs) and positive/negative selection cassette (yfcu,hdhfr) is transfected into an
unmodified line. Homologous recombination and positive selection with pyrimethamine ren-
ders a recipient line with a modified 30 UTR region. (B) After obtaining a clone by limiting dilu-
tion, the recipient line is transfected with a linear construct containing homology regions in the
50 and 30 UTRs. Negative selection with 5-fluorocytosine selects for parasites having integrated
the transfected construct and thereby lost the yfcu,hdhfr cassette. (C) The resulting transfected
line therefore contains the desired chimera or mutation and leaves the UTRs with minimal
changes. (D) Representative genotyping of transfected, recipient line (RL), and untransfected

S11 Fig. Tentative model outlining the molecular basis for parasite pausing. Rapid motility
relies on highly dynamic turnover of actin filaments. In the wild-type parasite, transient and
short filaments (dark blue, small arrowhead) are built from monomers (light blue) at the para-
site tip and are translocated to the rear by myosin. This retrograde flow results in a rearward
direction of force, ultimately propelling the organism forward as it attaches on a substrate. At
the rear, the filaments need to be rapidly disassembled (large arrowhead). This efficient turnover
allows for relatively consistent sporozoite movement. Jasplakinolide treatment results in a col-
lection of presumably longer filaments (small arrowhead) primarily at the front and rear of the
parasite (large arrowheads). This increased stability leads to reduced filament recycling and
thus the parasite stops moving. Mutations in actin subdomain 4 result in longer and more stable
filaments, as in the wild type. At the parasite rear, a reduced rate of disassembly might cause a
delay in filament recycling. This shift in equilibrium might cause a pause in motility until suffi-
cient restoration allows the parasite to generate the required filament flow. Filament orientation
is kept simple in this cartoon but might also change and lead to the observed rearward motion.
