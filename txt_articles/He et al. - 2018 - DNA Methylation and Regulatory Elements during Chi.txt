SUMMARY
The production of germ cells in vitro would open important new avenues for stem biology and human medicine, but the mechanisms of
germ cell differentiation are not well understood. The chicken, as a great model for embryology and development, was used in this study
to help us explore its regulatory mechanisms. In this study, we reported a comprehensive genome-wide DNA methylation landscape in
chicken germ cells, and transcriptomic dynamics was also presented. By uncovering DNA methylation patterns on individual genes,
some genes accurately modulated by DNA methylation were found to be associated with cancers and virus infection, e.g., AKT1 and
CTNNB1. Chicken-unique markers were also discovered for identifying male germ cells. Importantly, integrated epigenetic mechanisms
were explored during male germ cell differentiation, which provides deep insight into the epigenetic processes associated with male germ
cell differentiation and possibly improves treatment options to male infertility in animals and humans.
INTRODUCTION
Germ cells are the only cell type capable of transmitting
genetic information to the next generation. In many spe-
cies, germ cells form at the fringe of the embryo proper
and then traverse through several developing somatic tis-
sues on their migration to the emerging gonads. Primor-
dial germ cells (PGCs) are the only cells in developing em-
bryos with the potential to transmit genetic information
to the next generation (Nakamura et al., 2013). Chicken
PGCs, unlike mammals, exhibit unique migration activ-
ity, appearing within the epiblast in the blastoderm and
moving to the hypoblast of the area pellucida instead of
moving into embryonic gonads through the hindgut (Pe-
titte et al., 1997). During gastrulation, chicken PGCs
move to the germinal crescent, then circulate through
the blood vessels, finally settling in the gonadal ridge (Na-
kamura et al., 2007). In addition, chicken embryonic
development occurs in ovo rather than in utero (Burt and
Pourquie, 2003). These unique characteristics of chicken
germ cells during early development make germ cell isola-
tion easier and make it possible to gain a huge number of
cells from chicken embryos to advance stem cell research
(Li et al., 2004). Therefore, chicken models play a pivotal
role in animal research as an alternative and outbreed
experimental species to humans to compensate for ethical
constraints and the accessibility of human germ cell
studies, and understanding germ cell biology in vivo and
in vitro in chicken models would be important for prac-
tical applications of avian reproductive biology and
endogenous species conversation, especially for human
medicine, including various birth defects, germ cell
tumors, and drug target screening (Conti and Giudice,
2008).
DNA methylation is an essential epigenetic mechanism
in developmental biology and plays important roles in sex
chromosome dosage compensation, the maintenance of
genome stability, and the coordinated expression of im-
printed genes (Messerschmidt et al., 2014). PGCs, the pre-
cursors of sperm and eggs, are the route to totipotency
and require the establishment of a unique epigenome in
this lineage (Surani and Hajkova, 2010). In vertebrates,
DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively on CpG
islands
(CGIs).
Such
methylation
can
be
inherited
through cell division and transmitted from one genera-
tion to the next via germ cells. CGI methylation plays a
role in the maintenance of heterochromatin as well as
the inhibition of promoter activity by inhibiting the
interaction between transcriptional factors (TFs) and their
promoters or by changing the chromatin structure (Jang
et al., 2013). In general, TFs orchestrate the overall remod-
eling of the epigenome, including the priming of loci that

 will change expression only at late stages of embryo devel-
opment (Cantone and Fisher, 2013). Besides, TF binding
sites are overlapping with regions of dynamic changes
in DNA methylation and are linked to its targeted regula-
tion (Stadler et al., 2011). It has also been shown that line-
age-specific TFs and signaling pathways collaborate with
the core regulators of pluripotency to exit the embryonic
stem cell (ESC) state and activate the transcriptional net-
works governing cellular specification (Thomson et al.,
2011).
Notably, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently have
emerged as an important class of gene expression regula-
tors. lncRNAs exhibit several distinctive features that
confer unique regulatory functions, including exquisite
cell- and the tissue-specific expression and the capacity to
transduce higher-order spatial information. Some lncRNAs
were reported to be under control of pluripotency factors
such as OCT4 and NANOG. Interestingly, these lncRNAs
seemingly activate the transcription of pluripotent TFs
in a regulatory positive feedback loop (Sheik Mohamed
et al., 2010). In addition, the global DNA demethylation
is associated with a cascade of chromatin-remodeling
events, including the transient loss of linker histone H1,
H3K27me3, and H3K9me3, and stable loss of H3K9ac
and H2A/H4 R3me2, and, subsequently, reactivation of
the X chromosome in females (Chuva de Sousa Lopes
et al., 2008; Cantone and Fisher, 2013). During spermato-
genesis, methylation of histone tails is achieved by H3-
K4, and H3-K9 methyltransferases (Carrell et al., 2008).
Although histone modification patterns during spermato-
genesis and the interactions with DNA methylation have
been reported to perform specific roles (Teng et al., 2010;
Gu
¨nes
x and Kulac
¸, 2013), the orchestra among DNA methyl-
ation, TFs, lncRNAs, and histone modifications governing
cellular specification during spermatogenesis is as yet
poorly understood.
Recent evidence suggests that the DNA methylation
pattern in the chicken is similar to that in mammals (Li
et al., 2011), and DNA methylation and histone modifica-
tions are also involved in the pluripotency maintenance
and differentiation process of chick embryonic germ cells
(Jiao et al., 2013). Moreover, DNA methylation and his-
tone modifications are expressed in time- and tissue-
dependent manners in developing chick embryos, and
epigenetic marks are relatively stable and kept at lower
levels after birth (Gryzinska et al., 2013; Li et al., 2015).
Also, differentially methylated signatures associated with
gene expression were detected in PGCs during the early
embryonic development of chickens (Jang et al., 2013).
However, the precise and composited methylation regula-
tion patterns, non-coding RNAs and TFs remain rarely
studied in chick embryonic development. In this study,
therefore, we aimed to explore precise DNA methylation
regulation patterns during germline stem cell differentia-
tion, especially differentiating into male germ cells, using
methyl-CpG binding domain protein sequencing (MBD-
seq) approach. The three kinds of chick germ cells—
ESCs, PGCs, and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs)––were
collected to study epigenetic regulation mechanisms dur-
ing spermatogenesis. Our results provided the compre-
hensive insight into epigenetic regulations during chicken
spermatogenesis.
RESULTS
The Dynamics of DNA Methylation during Germ Cell
Differentiation
To study DNA methylation dynamics in chick spermato-
genesis, we performed DNA methylation sequencing on
genome-wide by MBD-seq for ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs iso-
lated from stage X blastoderm chick gonad at embryonic
day 5 (E5), and chick testis at E19, respectively (Figures
1A and 1B). Our results showed that ESCs have the lowest
methylation level (Figure 1C), which was consistent
with genome-wide loss of DNA methylation during early
mouse development, reaching a low point during the
blastocyst stage (Santos et al., 2002). PGCs have a higher
level of genome-wide methylation than ESCs and SSCs
during chick germ cell differentiation. To investigate
DNA methylation in different genomic regions across
three cell types, we profiled DNA methylation plots
covering upstream 20 kb, gene body region, and down-
stream 20 kb for all annotated chicken genes (Figure S1A).
We observed that ESCs had a lower methylation level
than PGCs and SSCs from outside of upstream 5 kb and
downstream 5 kb, but a sharp increase occurred in gene
body regions and around the transcriptional start and
end sites (TSSs and TESs) for ESCs.
To refine gene body regions and explore DNA methyl-
ation changes in different functional elements, we divided
chicken genome into the promoter, exon, intron, and in-
tergenic region plus CGI. The results demonstrated that
a large proportion of genomic methylation occurred
on CGIs, which had five times methylation enrichment
compared with the exon regions indicated in Figure 1D
(p < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test). Promoter regions were also en-
riched with abundant DNA methylation, which may be
due to the fact that most annotated gene promoters overlap
with a CGI (Deaton and Bird, 2011). It is noted that PGCs
had significantly higher methylation than ESCs and SSCs
across all these five functional elements, which was in
agreement with Figure 1C, which shows that PGCs were
experiencing de novo methylation and would last until
male germ cells. In addition, some differentially methyl-
ated regions (DMRs) among three cell types were validated

 by bisulfite cloning sequencing, and the results indicated
that 89% putative DMRs identified by MBD-seq were
confirmed (Figure S1B).
DNA Methylation and Gene Expression during Germ
Cell Differentiation
To detect DNA methylation regulation of gene expression
during germ cell differentiation, we examined differen-
tially expressed genes between every two cell types and
checked their DNA methylation levels in promoter regions.
Interestingly, of 916 unique differentially expressed genes
between ESCs and PGCs, 4.48% of genes are located on
chromosome Z, and in which 65.85% of them were down-
regulated from ESCs into PGCs; however, when PGCs were
differentiated into SSCs, 7.02% of 726 unique differentially
expressed genes are located on chromosome Z and 82.35%
of them were upregulated (Figure 2A). These results demon-
strated that most of the sex chromosome genes were acti-
vated at the second stage to drive sexual differentiation,
which conformed to the biological characteristics of cell
differentiation phenotype. The results of DNA methylation
enrichment on promoter regions of unique differentially
expressed genes showed that, in general, mRNA expression
of genes and their DNA methylation of promoter regions
had opposite expression directions, confirming that DNA
methylation represses gene transcription. From PGCs to
SSCs, their mRNA expression in ESCs was similar to that
in PGCs or SSCs, which was with low mRNA expression
in general (Figure 2B); thus, DNA methylation might
switch certain genes to be on or off depending on cellular
lineage and stage specificity.
To uncover methylation patterns associated with gene
expression change and functions of these genes, we identi-
fied clusters of genes with similar methylation profiles and

 corresponding expression changes by combining MBD-seq
and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data (Vanderkraats et al.,
2013). Only one significant cluster (p = 0.017) showing a
pattern of DNA methylation proximal to the TSS was
discovered including 661 genes that were differentially ex-
pressed between ESCs and PGCs (Figure 2C). The investiga-
tion in terms of functions and annotations of these genes
also further confirmed that they were enriched in cell
growth, cell division, and cell migration processes, as well
as cell cycle (Table 1). All the above are related to PGC func-
tion as a kind of ‘‘transgenerational stem cell’’ develops
from a small population of cells that are specifically set
aside in the extra-embryonic compartment very early dur-
ing embryogenesis. Therefore, a lot of genes participated in
cell division and cell migration when ESCs were differenti-
ated into PGCs, and 50 methylation change of these genes
might play crucial roles to regulate their mRNA transcrip-
tion. Likewise, we uncovered 7 significant clusters of
1,560 genes (6.03 3 10�13 < p < 0.024) with same DNA
methylation shape for each cluster and mRNA expression
change. However, similar DNA methylation signatures
were observed from clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4, with loss

 methylation through TSS and CGI shores, while clusters 5,
6, and 7 have other similar methylation signatures with
distal loss methylation of TSSs (Figure S2). Pathway analysis
of genes from clusters 1, 2, 3, and 4 showed that they partic-
ipated in the pathways related to the maintenance of cell
and tissue structure and function, dorsoventral axis forma-
tion, and some cancers (Table S1). However, the genes from
clusters 5, 6, and 7 with distal loss methylation involve
metabolism pathways and axon growth guidance (Table
S2). Therefore, DNA methylation change on TSS and CGI
shores (TSS ± 3 kb) might more tend to regulate their
gene expression than distal methylation change of genes
during germ cell differentiation. Collectively, the results
were also in agreement with reports that testicular DNA
has eight times the hypomethylated loci, and most of
them are generally away from the 50 regions of genes
compared with somatic tissues (Oakes et al., 2007).
DNA Methylation Regulation of Characteristic Genes
As reported that PGC formation depends on the bone
morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathway, we found that
the expressions of ALK2 receptor and SMAD1/5 signaling
are activated and committed to developing into PGCs.
Shortly thereafter, PGC fate and pluripotency are main-
tained by some genes, such as BLIMP1, POUV (OCT4),
SOX2, and NANOG (Pelosi et al., 2011). In our study, we
found that these genes were also differentially expressed
among ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs, suggesting that the BMP
pathway, SMAD signaling, the SOX family, and POUV, as
well as NANOG, could also be involved in chicken germline
stem cell differentiation as they are in humans and mice. To
validate and explore the function of the transforming
growth factor b (TGF-b)/BMP signaling pathway in the
regulation of male germ cell formation in the chicken, we
used inhibitors, LY2109761 and LDN193189, to repress
the expression of SMAD2 and SMAD5 in vitro and
in vivo. The results indicated that the mRNA expression of
SMAD2 and SMAD5 in inhibition groups was significantly
suppressed compared with the control group during chick
germ cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo; furthermore,
their protein expression was consistent with mRNA expres-
sion before and after inhibition, while DNA methylation
showed a decreasing trend during germ cell differentiation,
implying that the TGF-b/BMP4 signaling pathway could
promote male germ cell formation and that DNA methyl-
ation may regulate this process (see Figure 3).
To comprehensively study DNA methylation regulation
on stem cell differentiation, we concentrated on genes
associated with human stem cell differentiation and
further investigated their methylation status and gene
expression in chicken germline stem cells. The results
showed that some genes were unmethylated in ESCs with
no change of their transcriptions, but these genes could
be repressed by DNA methylation when ESCs were differ-
entiated into PGCs. Interestingly, they were activated in
SCCs, such as imprinting genes, and related TFs IGF2,
KLF4, and GDNF (see Figure S3A, upper panel). Further-
more, some genes with low methylation levels showed
high expression through all three cell types, and they
participate in pathways in cancers, including colorectal
cancer, endometrial cancer, and lung cancer, and also in
hepatitis B, which suggested that these genes regulated
by DNA methylation might be associated with carcinogen-
esis in early embryonic development, e.g., AKT1, CCND1,
MYC, CTNNB1, and PTEN (see Figure S3A, lower panel
and S3B). However, mRNA transcription of some genes
seems not be affected by DNA methylation (see Figure S3A,
middle panel). To refine the relationship between DNA
methylation and gene expression, we extracted genes
showing a correlation between gene expression and
DNA methylation at promoter or gene body regions (CGI
shores). The results showed an obvious linear correlation
between DNA methylation and gene expression such as
Nanog (Figure S3C). In addition, 31 of the genes (3.2%)
related to human stem cell differentiation not only showed
linear decrease dependence between their gene expression
and DNA methylation but were also found to have signifi-
cant methylation signatures (Table S3). Therefore, DNA
methylation of these genes might directly control their
mRNA transcriptions during chicken germline stem cell
differentiation.
It is known that X chromosome inactivation (XCI) is a
mechanism of dosage compensation that silences the

 majority of genes on one X chromosome in each female
cell (Sharp et al., 2011). In chickens, males are the homoga-
metic sex (ZZ), while females are the heterogametic sex
(ZW). The Z chromosome is larger and has more genes,
like the X chromosome in the XY system. To reveal
whether this event accompanies chicken germ cell differ-
entiation, we investigated DNA methylation distributions
on chicken chromosomes and found that DNA methyl-
ation densities were higher on chromosome W than on
chromosome Z, which was due to their huge difference in
chromosome sizes and gene numbers (Figures S4A and
S4B). To explore what genes on chromosome Z were meth-
ylated and involved in XCI, we profiled DNA methylation
enrichment of promoter regions and mRNA expression for
all genes on chromosome Z; the results demonstrated that
DNA methylation inactivated their gene expression in

 PGCs and SSCs, and more genes lost DNA methylation in
ESCs at the blastocyst stage; but low mRNA expression in
ESCs might be due to other factors (Figure S4C). Overall,
mRNA transcription of most genes on chromosome Z
was inactivated in chickens, which is consistent within
mammals.
Cell-Type-Specific Regulators in Germ Cell
Differentiation
In adult animals, spermatogenesis involves a continuous
differentiation of the spermatogonial stem and progeni-
tor cell population into mature sperm. A unique aspect
of this developmental process is the intensive germ-cell-
specific transcription of genes encoding many TFs, often
from alternative promoters (Kolthur-Seetharam et al.,
2008). However, the TFs for chicken germ cell differenti-
ation remain uncharacterized. Here, we uncovered puta-
tive TFs by detecting enriched TF motifs and cell-type-
specific regions of DNA methylation, and quantified their
activity and specificity on nearby genes (Pinello et al.,
2014). Twenty-nine ESC-specific TF motifs were found,
and 9 PGC-specific and 25 SSC-specific TF motifs were
identified (Table S4). In ESCs, the most significant TF,
EWSR1-FLI1 (q = 4.34 3 10�11), which can affect EGR2
expression, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and
tumor growth when EGR2 is silent (Gomez and Davis,
2015). KLF5 (q = 9.81 3 10�8) is involved in self-renewal
of mouse ESCs (Parisi et al., 2008). TF TFAP2C has been
reported to be essential for PGC maintenance (Schemmer
et al., 2013). Moreover, the HOX family including
HOXA5, HOXA9, and HOXC9, were identified in ESCs;
unlike HOX genes, HOX TFs are usually activated in vary-
ing spatial and temporal patterns in the development of
ESCs (Seifert et al., 2015). Of them, HOXA5 was studied
with regard to involvement in embryo and organ devel-
opment, and cell proliferation and methylation pathways
(Wang et al., 2015). As shown in Figures 4A–4C, downre-
gulation of HOXA5 implies that, during early embryonic
development, it commits ESCs into different lineages.
Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay (ChIP)-qPCR of
HOXA5 on the GFRA2 gene indicated that HOXA5 can
bind the GFRA2 gene and their affinity would decrease
when ESCs were differentiated into PGCs and then SSCs
(Figure 4E). Thus, low mRNA expression of the GFRA2
gene in ESCs might be caused by HOXA5 repression,
while decreased affinity or loss of HOXA5 on GFRA2
gene may result in activation of GFRA2 in PGCs, but a
dramatic reduction of GFRA2 mRNA expression in SSCs
could be caused by high methylation on its promoter
instead of HOXA5 suppression (Figures 4D and 4E). In
PGCs, TP53 might be involved in the regulation of cell
proliferation through DNA methylation. Similarly, tumor
protein p63, one of the p53 homologs encoded by the
TP63 gene, was also found in PGCs (Petre-Lazar et al.,
2007). Moreover, SREBF1 and SREBF2 in SREBF were iden-
tified in PGCs, appearing to have a unique function as de-
terminants of germ-cell-specific gene expression (Wang
et al., 2006). In addition, we found that some TFs were
associated with somatic testicular cells, e.g., GABPA in
SSCs (Chalmel et al., 2012). Furthermore, the SSCs ex-
pressed several TFs (Pou5f1, Sox2) required for reprogram-
ming fibroblasts into a pluripotent state, suggesting that a
single SSC can acquire pluripotentiality in chicken (Ka-
natsu-Shinohara et al., 2008). FOXP factors, e.g., FOXP1
and FOXP2 in chicken SSCs, act mainly as transcriptional
repressors mediated through interaction with HDAC pro-
teins (Herriges et al., 2012), implying that these TFs
might regulate spermatogenesis by histone modification
ways.
Long Non-coding RNA and Germ Cell Differentiation
As Figure S4A shows, most DNA methylation was en-
riched on chromosomes 16 and 25, while DNA methyl-
ation enrichment was not high on their genes, demon-
strating
that
DNA
methylation
mainly
occurred
in
intergenic regions of these two chromosomes. To disclose
whether non-coding RNA participates in germ cell differ-
entiation, long intergenic non-coding RNA (lincRNA),
one type of non-coding RNA, was identified. In total,
there were 5,925 lincRNAs recognized from three cell
types. Differentially expressed lincRNAs between different
cell types were analyzed, and some of them were also
confirmed by qPCR (Figures S5A and S5B). Interestingly,
a differentially expressed lincRNA, MAPKAPK5, a target
gene of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
signaling
in
the
embryonic
gonads
in
mice
(Ewen
et al., 2010), locates on the upstream of lincRNA5
(TCONS_00016108)
and had an opposite expression
profile compared with its neighboring lincRNA5 (Figures
5A
and
5B).
The
Dual-Luciferase
Reporter
Assay
of
MAPKAPK5 and lincRNA5 demonstrated that lincRNA5
can bind the promoter of the MAPKAPK5 gene. There-
fore, lincRNA5 could fractionally bind the promoter of
MAPKAPK5 to repress gene expression in SSCs compared
with that in ESCs, while high methylation might block
the binding in PGCs and suppress gene expression as an
alternative way (Figures 5C and 5D). To explore the
expression correlation of lincRNAs and their neighboring
genes, 451 differentially expressed genes between two cell
types and their neighboring lincRNA were applied for
expression correlation analysis (Figure S5C). Our results
demonstrated that expression distribution of lincRNAs
was, in general, similar to their neighboring gene. For
some lincRNAs, their expression directions at two stages
were that same as their neighboring genes. However,
most lincRNAs seemingly did not correlate with their
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 10 j 1793–1806 j June 5, 2018
1799
 neighboring gene expression. Hence, lincRNA as a regu-
lator might coordinate gene expression during germline
stem cell differentiation in a sophisticated way.
Because lincRNAs are spatially correlated with TFs, often
acting as scaffolds that help localize chromatin-modifying
complexes important for gene transcription in cis or in
trans (Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013; Herriges et al., 2014), TF mo-
tifs binding to lincRNAs were screened for each cell type: 29
TF motifs, 9 TF motifs, and 14 TF motifs were found to be
correlated with lincRNAs in ESC-, PGC-, and SSC-specific
cells, respectively (Table S5). Therefore, all TFs previously
predicted from ESCs and PGCs could act by lincRNAs, but
partial TFs from SSCs could function through lincRNAs
and epigenetic mechanisms.

The TF Z score is above 0, which means that HOXA5 is more expressed in ESC cell types than in others. The y axis denotes effects on the gene
nearby the regions containing the HOXA5 motif. Z score targets, marked with the red star, are below 0, which means that the target genes
are downregulated by HOXA5 in ESCs.

 DISCUSSION
While global DNA methylation analyses have been con-
ducted in chickens (Li et al., 2011; Gryzinska et al., 2013),
and the roles of DNA methylation in embryos explored
(Rocamora and Mezquita, 1989; Jang et al., 2013; Jiao
et al., 2013), we reported genome-wide DNA methylation
patterns during chicken germline stem cell differentiation
in this study. Our results showed that chicken ESCs isolated
from blastoderm, the layer of cells forming the wall of
the blastocyst, experienced demethylation, while chicken
PGCs experienced de novo methylation, and SSCs had
decreased methylation, which is similar to the patterns
observed in the mouse and human (Morgan et al., 2005;
Smith et al., 2012; Guo et al., 2014). Moreover, we found
that DNA methylation profiles of chicken embryos span-
ning upstream, TSS, gene body, TES, and downstream of a
gene are similar to those of human and mouse embryos,
and that the overall DNA methylation level of the gene
body was higher than that of neighboring intergenic re-
gions (Lister et al., 2009), indicating that the dynamic
changes of DNA methylation are in general universal
throughout the entire genome among species. It is known
that the process of methylation is catalyzed by three DNA
methyltransferases (DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B).
In our study, DNMT3A and DNMT3B were expressed
much higher in chick ESCs than in PGCs and SSCs, and
they predominated in ESCs of female chicks compared
with male chicks, which was consistent with previous re-
ports that DNMT3A is maternally provided and that they
are both expressed in early preimplantation embryos
(Okano et al., 1998) (Figure S6A). In addition, DNMT3B
was more active than DNMT3A in ESCs, implying that
DNMT3B might predominate in earlier embryonic devel-
opment, which was compatible with the conclusion that
the deletion of DNMT3B causes embryonic lethality, but

 that DNMT3A knockouts are partially viable (Okano et al.,
1999). However, the expression of DNMT1 that can sustain
genomic methylation status after DNA replication (Arand
et al., 2012) was undetected in all three cell types, which
might be because DNMT1 mainly contributes to the cell
proliferation in early preimplantation embryos.
So far, it has been apparent that DNA methylation and
histone modifications depend on each other. Certain his-
tone methylations cause a readily reversible local forma-
tion
of
heterochromatin,
whereas
DNA
methylation
leads to stable long-term repression (Cedar and Bergman,
2009), especially in embryonic germ cells (Jiao et al.,
2013). Therefore, a site-specific DNA methylation pattern
or other epigenetic marks are likely to participate in the
regulation of chick embryo development. In Figure S3C,
we found that the transcription of KDM5B, which encodes
a lysine-specific histone demethylase, was repressed from
ESCs to PGCs, but DNA methylation during this process re-
mained stable, suggesting that the transcription of histone
demethylase KDM5B might be affected by a histone
methylation strategy (Dey et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2011).
To investigate the interaction between DNA methylation
and histone methylation, we combined sequencing data
of H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (GEO: GSE65961) to check
the enrichment of DNA methylation on histone methyl-
ation regions and lincRNA regions across three kinds of
germ cells (Figure S6B). The results indicated that DNA
methylation was more enriched on H3K27me3 regions
than on H3K4me3 regions, which was in agreement with
the conclusion that DNA methylation is a ‘‘repressed’’
switch and that H3K27me3 is a ‘‘repressed’’ mark to gene
transcription. Moreover, there were more overlaps between
DNA methylation and histone methylation in PGCs than
in ESCs and SSCs, further confirming that DNA methyl-
ation and histone modifications are dependent on each
other in individual development. It is noted that DNA
methylation was enriched much less in lincRNA regions
compared with histone methylation regions, demon-
strating that DNA methylation has more interaction
with histone methylation than with lincRNAs. To check
the relationship between lincRNAs and histone modifica-
tions, lincRNA enrichment scores were calculated in two
histone methylation marks, and the results showed that
lincRNAs were more enriched in H3K27me3 regions
than in H3K4me3, and that lincRNA enrichment on the
H3K27me3 mark was about six times more than DNA
methylation enrichment on the H3K27me3 mark (see Fig-
ures S6B and S6C), which implied that lincRNAs might pre-
fer to interact with repressed histone marks to depress gene
expression, and that lincRNAs are likely to be involved in
more events of histone modifications compared with
DNA methylation, which is consistent with the fact that
some lincRNAs contain multiple binding sites for distinct
protein complexes that direct specific combinations of his-
tone modifications on target gene chromatin (Tsai et al.,
2010). In our study, 36 SSC gene markers were detected in
the chicken and they showed cell-type-specific expression
during chick germ cell differentiation, which is similar
within the human and mouse, suggesting that these
markers could be universal gene makers to identify male
germ cells (Table S6). Chicken-unique SSC gene markers
(121) were uncovered, and their expression change could
be controlled by DNA methylation (Table S7).
In terms of similar epigenetic discoveries of male germ
cell differentiation in different organisms, we explored
their shared mechanisms (Figure 6). Interestingly, we
found that increased DNA methylation on promoter re-
gions or CGI shores would repress gene expression or adjust
their expression in a dose-dependent manner. For example,
decreased DNA methylation for BCL2 and CSF3R genes
from ESCs to PGCs activated their mRNA transcription in
PGCs, and continual decrease from PGCs to SSCs caused
their expression to be higher in SSCs. However, for the
IGF2R gene, tremendously increased methylation at the
stage of ESCs to PGCs turned off its mRNA transcription
in PGCs, but the subsequently decreased methylation
caused this gene to be fractionally expressed in SSCs (Fig-
ure 6A). We also found that DNA methylation at gene pro-
moters has a negative effect on certain TFs. In our study,
HOXA5 was identified from chick ESCs and it downregu-
lates its target genes. As Figures 4D and 4E show, GFRA2
as a target gene of HOXA5 had a strong affinity in ESCs,
suppressing GFRA2 gene transcription in ESCs. However,
its affinity with HOXA5 decreased in PGCs, accompanying
a mild methylation change in the promoter region, which
released GFRA2 and caused it to reach a high expression in
PGCs. In SSCs, increasing methylation of the GFRA2 gene
blocked HOXA5 binding to the promoter region and
extremely repressed gene expression in SSCs in an alterna-
tive way (Figure 6B). GFRA2 involves stem cell differentia-
tion with stem markers (Garcia-Lavandeira et al., 2009;
Santiago et al., 2014), implying that HOXA5 and its target
genes play vital roles in chicken male germ cell differentia-
tion. Most interestingly, lincRNAs may bind to gene pro-
moters. For the MAPKAPK5 gene, extremely increased
methylation on its promoter region when ESCs were differ-
entiated into PGCs made its expression very low, even
silent, in PGC cells. When PGCs became SSCs, the methyl-
ation was dramatically removed for a neighboring lincRNA
binding, which could repress MAPKAPK5 transcription
instead of DNA methylation (see Figures 5 and 6C). Here,
we consider lincRNAs acting as scaffolds for RNA-binding
proteins recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes. For
CDX2 gene, there was no DNA methylation change across
all three chicken germ cell types, but we identified STAT1
and TFAP2c TFs in ESCs, and they can be assembled by a
1802
Stem Cell Reports j Vol. 10 j 1793–1806 j June 5, 2018
 lincRNA to form a complex with RNA polymerase II.
The expression of TFAP2c was induced by STAT1 in ESCs,
and then caused TFAP2c to act on active histone mark
H3K4me3, consequently upregulating CDX2 expression.
However, there were no STAT1 and TFAP2c found in
PGCs and SSCs, so the loss of functions of H3K4me3 caused
the CDX2 gene to be repressed (Figure 6D). In addition,
methyltransferases DNMT3A and DNMT3B, BMP pathway,
and SMAD signaling are also involved in chicken male
germ cell differentiation (Figures 3 and 6). Taken together,
multiple epigenetic events, including DNA methylation,
histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, may act syn-
ergistically instead of single regulation mode during em-
bryonic development, and this kind of regulation mode
owns typical cell lineage specification.
Conclusions
In summary, our study provides a comprehensive atlas at
the genome-wide scale of the DNA methylation landscape
in chicken germline stem cells; transcriptomic dynamics is
also presented. Universal gene markers and unique chicken
markers were discovered for identifying male germline
stem cells. Moreover, the integrated epigenetic mecha-
nisms were explored during chicken male germ cell differ-
entiation, which will help us understand the epigenetic
processes associated with male germ cell differentiation
and possibly improve treatment options for male infertility
in animals and humans.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Full experimental methods are provided within Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
Sample Collection
All eggs were immediately collected for isolation of three kinds of
germline stem cells (ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs) after fertilization in
the National Poultry Institute at the Chinese Academy of Agricul-
tural Sciences. All procedures involving the care and use of animals
conformed to U.S. National Institute of Health guidelines (NIH
Publication No. 85-23, revised 1996), and were approved by the
Laboratory Animal Management and Experimental Animal Ethics
Committee of Yangzhou University.
MBD-Seq and RNA-Seq
Genomic DNA from ESCs, PGCs, and SSCs was extracted for per-
forming MBD-seq with two biological replicates per cell type. Total
RNA from three cell types was prepared with multiple biological
replicates. All sequencing libraries were analyzed on the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 Analyzer following manufacturer protocols.

 Bioinformatics Analysis
All sequencing data were evaluated and trimmed off for high-qual-
ity assurance, and then aligned to the galGal4 reference genome by
bowtie v.1.1.1 for MBD-seq data and TopHat v.2.0.9 for RNA-seq
data. For data manipulation, filtration, and format conversion, a
combination of procedures available in SAMtools and BEDtools
was applied. Peaks of DNA methylation were called using
MACS1.4.2, and the following DMRs were identified by DiffBind
R package with an edgeR analysis. Mapped RNA-seq reads were
assembled and analyzed by cufflinks v.2.1.1 series, and, finally,
normalized gene expression was output as FPKM (fragments per
kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads). The differentially
expressed genes were filtered out by particular criteria. lincRNAs
were identified from RNA-seq data with a robust pipeline devel-
oped by our lab (He et al., 2016). HAYSTACK pipeline was used
to identify cell-type-specific TF motifs with DNA methylation
data and quantify their activity on nearby genes. To uncover func-
tional genes with differential methylation patterns associated with
expression change of these genes, WIMSi was applied to identify
groups of genes with similarly shaped methylation signatures
and
corresponding
expression
changes
based
on
MBD-seq
and RNA-seq data. Our previous sequencing data in terms of
H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (GEO: GSE65961) were also introduced
for integration analysis.
Validation Experiments
A few DMRs were selected and validated by bisulfite cloning
sequencing as well as DNA methylation of SMAD2 and SMAD5
on promoters. The results were analyzed by QUMA (http://quma.
cdb.riken.jp), and DNA methylation levels for each region and
group were obtained. DNA methylation of some genes involved
in Figure 6 was confirmed using bisulfite pyrosequencing technol-
ogy. Real-time PCR using iQ SYBR Green Supermix was utilized to
validate differentially expressed lincRNAs between cell types.
To explore the function of the TGF-b/BMP signaling pathway in
the regulation of male germ cell formation, TGF-b signaling
pathway-specific inhibitors, LY-100 and LDN-100, were added to
inhibit Smad2 and Smad5 expression in vitro and in vivo. qRT-
PCR was performed to evaluate the inhibition efficiency of TGF-b
signaling. The phosphorylated SMAD protein levels were identi-
fied by western blotting before and after inhibition in vitro and
in vivo with triple biological replicates. ChIP was performed with
HOXA5 antibody in three cell types, and a subsequent qPCR
was applied for measuring HOXA5 affinity on GFRA2 promoter
through all cell types. To validate whether the MAPKAPK5 gene
is bound to its neighboring lincRNA, the Dual-Luciferase Reporter
Assay was conducted in the T293 cell line to avoid the effects of
chicken endogenous genes. The MAPKAPK5 reporter gene vector
and the lincRNA overexpression vector were constructed and
transfected in 293T cells. Finally, luciferase expression indicated
the binding of lincRNA to the cloned MAPKAPK5 target sequence.
