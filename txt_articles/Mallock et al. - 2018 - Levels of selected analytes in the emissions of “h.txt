Abstract
Consumers of combustible cigarettes are exposed to many different toxicologically relevant substances associated with nega-
tive health effects. Newly developed “heat not burn” (HNB) devices are able to contain lower levels of Harmful and Poten-
tially Harmful Constituents (HPHCs) in their emissions compared to tobacco cigarettes. However, to develop toxicological 
risk assessment strategies, further independent and standardized investigations addressing HPHC reduction need to be done. 
Therefore, we generated emissions of a commercially available HNB product following the Health Canada Intense smok-
ing regimen and analyzed total particulate matter (TPM), nicotine, water, aldehydes, and other volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) that are major contributors to health risk. We show that nicotine yield is comparable to typical combustible ciga-
rettes, and observe substantially reduced levels of aldehydes (approximately 80–95%) and VOCs (approximately 97–99%). 
Emissions of TPM and nicotine were found to be inconsistent during the smoking procedure. Our study confirms that levels 
of major carcinogens are markedly reduced in the emissions of the analyzed HNB product in relation to the conventional 
tobacco cigarettes and that monitoring these emissions using standardized machine smoking procedures generates reliable 
and reproducible data which provide a useful basis to assess exposure and human health risks.

Tobacco consumption remains one of today’s major health 
hazards and was responsible for more than one in ten deaths 
in the year 2015 (GBD 2015 Tobacco Collaborators 2017). 
Consequently, tobacco control was strengthened by multiple 
measures in recent years, partly driven by implementation 
of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control 
(FCTC) (World Health Organization 2018). One strategy 
of tobacco companies to adapt to growing public and politi-
cal pressure for further restrictions is the development of 
modified risk products or alternate tobacco products that 
are implied to be less hazardous. These claims are often 
based on reduced toxicant levels in the emissions, although 
these data cannot be directly translated into a health risk 
reduction. Notably, toxicant reduction strategies had also 
been proposed by WHO (World Health Organization 2014), 
opening discussions about feasibility of benefits for both 
smoking populations and individual smokers.
In principle, the conventional cigarettes are highly engi-
neered products. A burning cigarette can be regarded as a 
connection of endo- and exothermic combustion systems 
(Baker et al. 2004). Yet, it gains complexity, since multi-
ple mechanisms affect the generation of smoke (Muramatsu

2005). Smoke constituents are generated according to a 
temperature gradient depending on exothermic combus-
tion within the burning tip. During puffs, temperatures can 
reach up to 950 °C. The majority of compounds, however, 
are formed in endothermic reactions within the adjacent 
pyrolysis-distillation zone where temperatures decrease from 
approximately 600 to 200 °C (Baker et al. 2004). Cigarette 
smoke consists of approximately 4800 compounds (Rodg-
man and Green 2003). At least 69 carcinogens had been 
identified by the year 2000 (Hoffmann et al. 2001) with an 
update to 98 hazardous components in 2011 (Talhout et al. 
2011). Fowles and Dybing proposed an approach for prioriti-
zation of tobacco smoke constituents by applying toxicologi-
cal risk assessment methods. They identified 1,3-butadiene 
and other substances like acetaldehyde as major contributors 
to cancer risk and thus suggested that harm reduction efforts 
should set a special focus on volatile organic compounds 
(Fowles and Dybing 2003).
Attempts to reduce the toxicity of tobacco smoke can be 
traced back to the 1960s. The initial strategies aimed for the 
reduction of specific compounds with ambiguous effects on 
overall toxicant levels (Baker et al. 2004). Further strate-
gies to reduce toxicant levels included filter tips, filter per-
foration, as well as technical features such as porosity of 
cigarette paper and tobacco processing (Hoffmann et al. 
2001). Although nicotine and tar content have decreased 
by more than 60% since the 1950s, this trend could not be 
linked to a drop in mortality rates among smokers. Further-
more, proliferation of low-yield cigarettes became a highly 
controversial issue. Despite the lower tar and nicotine con-
tents, toxicant exposure has even increased when smoking 
intensities and profiles of long-term smokers are considered 
(Hoffmann et al. 2001). Further means to reduce the toxicity 
of tobacco smoke are limited, because combustion and con-
sequently pyrolysis and distillation cannot be avoided in the 
conventional cigarettes. Since most hazardous compounds 
in tobacco smoke are formed between 200 and 700 °C, lower 
temperatures would limit formation of noxious compounds. 
Although earlier “heat not burn” (HNB) devices failed to 
gain consumer acceptance (Caputi 2016), these systems 
provide some advantages in terms of toxicant reduction 
compared to the conventional cigarettes (Henkler and Luch 
2015).
First, in contrast to low-yield cigarettes, reduction of tar 
and associated toxicants is not necessarily interlinked with 
lower nicotine levels. Therefore, an increased consumption 
aimed at compensating deficient nicotine delivery becomes 
unlikely. Second, the previous reports indicate that far 
lower levels of relevant carcinogens can be achieved in 
newly developed HNB devices. One novel product referred 
to as “Tobacco Heating System 2.2” (THS2.2) is currently 
marketed in more than twenty countries. The manufacturer 
has stated that the yield of harmful and potentially harmful 
constituents (HPHC) is reduced by about 90% compared to 
the 3R4F reference cigarette. Importantly, a reduction of 
more than 95% was reported for major carcinogens, includ-
ing benzene and 1,3-butadiene, when emissions were gen-
erated using the Health Canada Intense smoking regimen 
(Schaller et al. 2016).
From the perspective of risk assessment, it is essential 
to verify levels of toxicants including nicotine that can be 
reliably achieved in novel or modified tobacco products. It 
needs to be clarified whether standardized machine smok-
ing procedures and standardized analytical methods lead to 
reproducible data that can be used to compare devices and 
to define a standard to be met if reductions were recognized 
as relevant. This is also an important prerequisite to address 
the issue of putatively modified health risks or to provide a 
differentiated risk assessment according to product features 
and specifications. However, independent investigations are 
scarce and urgently required. We have, therefore, analyzed 
the mainstream smoke emitted by THS2.2 products using 
different variants of commercially available tobacco sticks. 
This study was focused on the group of carcinogenic vola-
tile organic compounds and aldehydes in particular accord-
ing to the prioritization framework proposed by Fowles and 
Dybing (2003). The acquired data provide an important 
basis to address health risks and potential benefits in terms 
of a potentially reduced exposure to toxicologically relevant 
constituents.
Four tobacco heating devices and two different tobacco 
stick variants were analyzed with an LM4E smoking 
machine (Borgwaldt, Hamburg, Germany) following the 
Health Canada Intense smoking regimen (Health Canada 
2000). Detailed description of analytical procedure can 
be found in the Supplementary Material. An overview of 
the measured levels of analytes in the emissions of the two 
different tobacco stick variants is given in Table 1. The 
obtained values from all used devices were pooled. We com-
pared our emission findings to levels in mainstream smoke 
of different combustible cigarettes, including low and high 
tar, slim, and reference cigarettes, that were published by 
Counts et al. (2005). We displayed the lowest and the highest 
yields per analyte that could stem from different brands and 
calculated the corresponding reductions of our findings as 
averages of both stick variants. The levels of nicotine in this 
study were lower compared to the data provided by the man-
ufacturer (Schaller et al. 2016) and also lower but still in the 
same range compared to the conventional cigarettes (Counts 
et al. 2005). Total particulate matter (TPM) was comparable 
to the manufacturer’s findings and higher than TPM from 
some combustible cigarettes. The yields of the carbonyl 
compounds formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, and cro-
tonaldehyde were, with a reduction of 80–96%, considerably 
lower when compared to combustible cigarettes (Table 1) 
and comparable to the published emissions observed by the 
 2147

manufacturer (Schaller et al. 2016). Similar to the carbonyl 
compounds, the emissions of the volatile and semi-volatile 
compounds benzene, 1,3-butadiene, isoprene, styrene, and 
toluene were with a reduction of 97 to over 99% markedly 
lower when compared to combustible cigarettes (Table 1). 
The range of values found is again similar to the manufac-
turer’s data (Schaller et al. 2016). To address consistency of 
nicotine and TPM release during the smoking procedure, 
the 12 puffs of the smoking protocol were divided into four 
intervals of three puffs each and analyzed separately. The 
nicotine and TPM release was shown to be inconsistent with 
lower yields in the beginning. More detailed information can 
be found in the Supplementary Material.
For a profound assessment of health risks and putative 
benefits, independent studies by different laboratories are 
needed. Furthermore, our intention was not only to reassess 
emissions of HPHC and compare to other studies, but also to 
use standardized methods as used by surveillance authorities 
and establish them for this particular application. More HNB 
products from different manufacturers are expected to appear 
on a wider market in the future with claims of reduced toxi-
cant levels. Therefore, surveillance authorities will require 
standardized methods for routine analysis of HNB products 
to verify claims and to protect consumers from being misled.
In this study, we applied methods that are based on inter-
national standards to investigate emissions of a novel HNB 
product. We have used a commercially available linear 
smoking machine that was initially developed for electronic 
cigarettes. Thus, the procedure can be easily transferred. Our 
data are in good agreement with some recent investigations. 
In their recent study, Li et al. analyzed a set of HPHCs, 
including aldehydes and VOCs, in the emissions of the same 
HNB product using ISO and HCI smoking regimen (Li et al. 
2018). The data presented in our study support their find-
ings and conclusions. Farsalinos et al. analyzed the nicotine 
delivery in the preceding HNB model of the same manufac-
turer (Farsalinos et al. 2017). They found a higher nicotine 
yield as compared with the currently marketed THS2.2 that 
was analyzed here. Another study that used a custom instru-
ment and custom smoking regimen reported similar findings 
for aldehydes but not for nicotine (Auer et al. 2017). A recent 
study by Bekki et al., that used the preceding HNB model as 
well, focused on tobacco-specific nitrosamines (Bekki et al. 
2017). Their determined levels for nicotine, TPM, and water 
are comparable to ours. Another group developed a head-
space solid-phase microextraction-based method for semi-
quantitative assessment of VOCs emitted by HNB products 
(Savareear et al. 2017). The issue of toxicant reduction is 
complex, since these calculations depend on the reference 
product. Importantly, our data confirm absolute values for 
selected toxicants in the emissions of the analyzed HNB that 
are in agreement with data published by the manufacturer 
(Schaller et al. 2016). Furthermore, our study is in agree-
ment with the currently published FDA Tobacco Products 
Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) briefing document 
(Food and Drug Administration 2018).
Another interesting point to show was that emissions of 
particulate matter and nicotine were not consistent during 
the smoking procedure. Unlike electronic cigarettes, in the 
European Union conventional cigarettes are not regulated to

provide consistent nicotine delivery. Although HNB prod-
ucts are likewise not regulated in terms of consistency of 
nicotine delivery, the observed inconsistent delivery may 
influence consumer satisfaction, nicotine blood levels, and 
adaptations of smoking behavior, and needs to be investi-
gated further.
In our study, we found comparatively high levels of tar. 
For the conventional cigarettes, “tar” is defined as particulate 
matter subtracted by nicotine and water (ISO 4387:2000), 
and is limited to 10 mg tar per cigarette as determined with 
the ISO smoking regimen (ISO 3308:2012) according to 
European regulations (EU 2014). Importantly, the water 
content in the smoke of the HNB product is high compared 
to the conventional cigarettes, thus affecting the NFDPM 
calculation more than in the conventional cigarettes. The 
manufacturer applied a special instrumental set-up to avoid 
the loss of water (Ghosh and Jeannet 2014). This special 
equipment is neither standardized nor applicable for surveil-
lance authorities. Therefore, we decided to use the extrac-
tion and titration method which is already applied in routine 
analysis.
Although the NFDPM value for HNB products can be 
formally calculated as for the conventional cigarettes, direct 
comparisons would be misleading. TPM of the conventional 
cigarettes, which is defined as the portion that is trapped 
on the filter (ISO 4387:2000), contains typical toxicants 
that were confirmed to be strongly reduced in the analyzed 
HNB product. In contrast, the proportion of humectants in 
NFDPM of HNB products is markedly higher compared to 
the conventional tobacco cigarettes.
The strongly reduced HPHC levels in the emissions 
of the analyzed HNB device are likely to reduce toxicant 
exposure. Nevertheless, it should be noted that machine 
smoking protocols are standardized methods aimed to 
monitor reliable emissions, but not accurate models for 
human exposure or smoking behavior. Further studies are 
required to address the magnitude of exposure reduction. 
However, the herein confirmed reductions of relevant 
toxicants by about 80–99% are substantial, leading to the 
relevant question of putatively reduced health risks. Risk 
assessment models need to be established that could take 
advantage of the framework for prioritization of carcino-
gens in cigarette smoke as proposed by Fowles and Dybing 
(2003). Mainstream smoke constituents were prioritized 
according to their concentrations and their cancer potency 
factors. A recent study performed calculations with one 
data set of THS2.2 and provisionally concluded cancer 
potencies of HNB products to be more than 10% lower 
than the conventional cigarettes (Stephens 2018). We 
could confirm a highly substantial reduction of prioritized 
major carcinogens, such as 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, 
and benzene. Several studies addressed lowered health 
risks due to reduced smoking of tobacco cigarettes and 
substantial data are available (Inoue-Choi et al. 2018; Law 
et al. 1997; Pesch et al. 2012). It is still uncertain whether 
these data are applicable to model reduced exposure in 
relation to HNB products. Although modified health risks 
are expected, it is difficult to provide an estimate for both 
populations and individual smokers.
HNB products are a novelty to the market and more 
manufacturers are expected to launch new versions in 
this product category. Therefore, it is essential to define 
criteria that should be met by new products. Analytical 
assessment of HPHC contents in mainstream smoke can 
help to define these standards. Regarding a risk–benefit 
analysis that is required for novel tobacco products in 
Europe (2014/40/EU) (EU 2014), substantial reductions 
of toxicant levels might be regarded as a discrete benefit 
compared to combustible cigarette consumption, even if 
potential consequences for human health still need to be 
explored. This is consistent with the previous approaches 
proposed for the conventional cigarettes by WHO (World 
Health Organization 2014).
We propose that new HNB products need to show 
comparable or lower HPHC levels in the emissions as the 
analyzed device to confirm a benefit in the context of an 
overall risk assessment. The applicable values for toxicant 
levels should be continuously minimized and reassessed 
when refined products and technologies become available. 
By contrast, it should be considered insufficient to show 
only a minor decrease of HPHC levels in comparison to 
the conventional cigarettes. Furthermore, it should be 
assessed whether other levels of toxicologically relevant 
substances are elevated in return as already discussed for 
propylene glycol, glycerol, glycidol, and acetol (Food and 
Drug Administration 2018). Therefore, further studies 
need to be conducted: first, more independent assessments 
of toxicant yields need to be published by using standard-
ized methods for the above discussed reasons. Second, it 
should be examined whether HNB products lead to other 
toxicants and health hazards that have been neglected so 
far. Finally, the long-term impact on public health needs 
to be assessed in the future.
