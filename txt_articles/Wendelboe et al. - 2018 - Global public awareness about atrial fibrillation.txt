Abstract
Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an important cause of ischemic stroke that often re-
mains undetected until stroke occurs. Awareness of the risk factors and symptoms is impor-
tant so that AF can be diagnosed and thromboprophylaxis given. However, the extent of 
public awareness of AF is uncertain. We assessed public awareness of AF across six conti-
nents and compared it with that of other thrombotic and non- 
thrombotic disorders.
Methods: In collaboration with Ipsos- 
Reid, we conducted an internet- 
based, cross- 
sectional survey between September and October of 2016 in 10 countries: Argentina, 
Australia, Canada, Germany, Japan, Thailand, the Netherlands, Uganda, United 
Kingdom, and United States. Participants were selected from survey panels in weighted, 
age- 
stratified categories (40- 
60, 61- 
74, and ≥75 years). The survey included 11 ques-
tions about demographics and assessed awareness about AF, as well as that of other 
thrombotic and non- 
thrombotic disorders. Proportions and 95% confidence intervals 
(CI) were calculated.
Results: Of a total of 6312 respondents, overall awareness of AF was 48% (95% CI, 
46- 
50%), which was lower than awareness about other thrombotic and non- 
thrombotic

1 | INTRODUCTION
In 2010, there were an estimated 33.5 million cases of atrial fibrilla-
tion globally and about 5 million new cases annually.1 In contrast to 
decreasing incidence rates of ischemic heart disease, the age- 
adjusted 
incidence of atrial fibrillation continues to rise.2,3 If patients with atrial 
fibrillation were promptly diagnosed and treated, the incidence of isch-
emic stroke would likely decrease even more rapidly. Therefore, public 
awareness of atrial fibrillation, in particular understanding its risk fac-
tors and symptoms, is critical to address this public health problem.
The Future of Anticoagulation Initiative International Steering 
Committee recently recommended improved public awareness of atrial 
fibrillation.4 These efforts include the Global Atrial Fibrillation Alliance 
Foundation’s World Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Day in the US,5 the Heart 
Rhythm Week screening program in Belgium,6 and the establishment 
of October 13 as World Thrombosis Day by the International Society 
on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH). Since 2014, ISTH and World 
Thrombosis Day partners have focused on activities aimed to reduce the 
global burden of thrombotic disorders, including hospital acquired venous 
thromboembolism and ischemic stroke associated with atrial fibrillation.
The extent of global awareness of atrial fibrillation is unknown. 
To address this gap, we conducted an internet survey in 10 countries 
across every continent (except Antarctica) to compare global public 
awareness of atrial fibrillation with that of other thrombotic and non- 
thrombotic disorders.
2 | METHODS
2.1 | Survey instrument
In collaboration with Ipsos- 
Reid, an international social and media re-
search firm, we developed an internet- 
based quantitative survey to 
assess public awareness about atrial fibrillation, other thrombotic dis-
orders (i.e, thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, 
heart attack, and stroke) and common non- 
thrombotic disorders (hy-
pertension, HIV/AIDS, diabetes, breast cancer, and prostate cancer). 
A fictitious condition “haemo- 
distension syndrome” was included as 
a quality control measure to assess the extent to which participants 
over- 
estimate their awareness of medical conditions. Ipsos- 
Reid con-
tracts with Survey Sampling International (SSI) to administer surveys 
to participants aged ≥18 years who were previously on Internet pan-
els who had opted- 
in to do online research.7
The survey included questions about awareness of the risk factors, 
symptoms and signs, and complications of atrial fibrillation. Most of 
the questions used a check box/select all that apply format. Two ques-
tions used a Likert scale (1 [low] to 5 [high]); the first to assess personal 
concern for the various health conditions and the second to assess 
agreement with the following atrial fibrillation- 
related statements: (1) 
Taking your pulse is a reliable way to diagnose atrial fibrillation; (2) 
Atrial fibrillation can easily be diagnosed by a doctor taking your pulse; 
(3) Atrial fibrillation is almost always treated with surgery; and (4) Atrial 
fibrillation can cause a stroke.
Solicited demographic information included age, gender, educa-
tion level (less than high school, some high school, graduation from 
high school, some college or university, college or university degree, 
or post graduate degree), country of residence, and general population 
density of residence (major city, small city, or living in an area far away 
from a city of any size). The survey, which could be completed in about 
5 minutes, is included in the Appendix.
2.2 | Selection of survey participants
The survey was conducted between September 22 and October 13, 
2016 in the following 10 countries: Argentina, Australia, Canada, 
disorders except for deep vein thrombosis (awareness 43%, 95% CI, 41- 
45%). 
Awareness about AF ranged from 25% to 69% across countries, while awareness of 
the risk factors for AF ranged from 8% to 52%, and awareness that AF leads to stroke 
ranged from 36% to 46%. Among those reporting awareness of AF, 82% correctly 
identified palpitations as an AF symptom.
Conclusions: Global public awareness of AF is low. Improving awareness may em-
power patients to seek timelier stroke preventive care.

Germany, Japan, Thailand, the Netherlands, Uganda, United 
Kingdom (UK), and the United States (US). Surveys were translated 
into Spanish, German, Japanese, Thai, Dutch, Swahili, and French 
and back- 
translated into English. In addition, surveys were avail-
able in North American English, UK English, and Australian English 
in their respective countries. Respondents were 40 years of age 
or older who had been previously recruited to Internet panels and 
had opted- 
in to do online research. Invitations were sent via email 
with a link to the survey and there was no additional solicitation. 
Eligibility was based on age, sex, and country of residence and was 
determined at the start of each survey. Ipsos- 
Reid offered points 
for each completed survey commensurate with the time required 
to complete it. Points could be redeemed for rewards, such as gift 
cards for local popular merchants.
We aimed to collect between 140 and 780 participants from each 
country for a total sample size of 6312. By age group, 1400 partic-
ipants were aged 40- 
60 years (140 per country), 2160 were aged 
61- 
75 years (240 per country except 0 in Thailand), and 2752 were 
aged 75+ years (0 in Argentina and Thailand, 240 in Uganda, 252 in 
Germany, 311 in the UK, 349 in the Netherlands, and 400 each in 
the US, Canada, Australia, and Japan). The differences in participation 
across age categories likely reflect the association between age and 
internet use in each country. The research was conducted according 
to guidelines established by the Council of American Survey Research 
Associations.8
2.3 | Statistical analysis
The survey administration system required completion of each item 
so there was no missing data for primary variables. The use of skip 
patterns resulted in appropriately missing data, such as those people 
who indicated they were unaware of a condition were not asked fol-
low- 
up questions. The data were weighted according to the popula-
tion size using the most recent available country- 
specific census data. 
For Likert scale questions, the lowest two categories and the highest 
two categories were collapsed for three mutually exclusive catego-
ries. Descriptive statistics were generated using PROC SURVEYFREQ 
in SAS 9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) to summarize the findings. Comparison 
of proportions and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) 
with α = 0.05 were calculated to compare differences across catego-
ries. Logistic regression analysis using PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC was 
used to estimate awareness while controlling for age group, gender, 
and country. The Rao- 
Scott χ2 test was used to estimate differences 
in proportions across categories.
3 | RESULTS
The targeted age- 
, sex- 
, and country- 
specific sample sizes were ob-
tained and the distribution of demographic characteristics is summa-
rized in Table 1. The distribution of education level was significantly 
different by country (p < .01). The proportions of respondents who 
had at least some college or university for each country were: Thailand 
(88.1%), US (78.6%), Argentina (71.5%), Canada (63.4%), Australia 
(63.2%), UK (62.6%), Japan (57.4%), Netherlands (35.2%), Germany 
(30.6%), and Uganda (24.3%).
3.1 | Awareness of atrial fibrillation
Overall awareness of atrial fibrillation was 48% (95% CI: 46- 
50%) 
and was lower than all other conditions except deep vein thrombosis 
(43%). Reported awareness was highest for diabetes and hypertension 
(85% for each). Figure 1 shows overall awareness for each condition 
and Table 2 reports awareness stratified by age group, gender, relative

population density of residence, and country. There was a significant 
increase in awareness of atrial fibrillation by age group; however, this 
pattern did not hold for the other conditions. Females were signifi-
cantly more aware of atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, deep vein 
thrombosis, stroke, hypertension, and breast cancer than males. By 
country, Uganda reported the highest awareness of atrial fibrillation 
(69%, 95% CI: 64- 
75%) and Canada reported the lowest (25%, 95% 
CI: 21- 
29%).
3.2 | Underlying cause, description, and symptoms of 
atrial fibrillation
The majority of participants accurately recognized atrial fibrillation as 
an irregular, usually rapid heartbeat (62%, 95% CI: 60- 
64%). However, 
only 36% (95% CI: 34- 
38%) were aware that atrial fibrillation can lead 
to stroke. This proportion was only slightly higher than the propor-
tion of respondents who were incorrect in their reporting that atrial 
fibrillation leads to high blood pressure (30%, 95% CI: 28- 
31%). The 
distributions of these and other responses regarding the recognition 
of signs, symptoms, and sequela are shown in Table 3.
Among the 1764 (24.7%) participants who reported that they 
would know what atrial fibrillation felt like if they experienced it, rec-
ognition of symptoms was relatively high, as shown in Table 4. Heart 
palpitations were the most commonly identified sign (82%, 95% CI: 
80- 
85%) while fatigue and inability to exercise were the least com-
monly identified symptoms (43%, 95% CI: 39- 
46%). The proportion 
of participants selecting an incorrect risk factor ranged from 8% to 
20% and incorrect risk factors identified included coughing up blood, 
temporary paralysis of a limb, numbness, and a tingling or burning 
sensation.
3.3 | Risk factors for atrial fibrillation
The distribution of recognition of correct and incorrect risk factors 
for atrial fibrillation was similar, as shown in Table 3. The recognition 
of correct risk factors ranged from 8% to 52%, while the reporting of 
incorrect risk factors ranged from 3% to 42%. High blood pressure 
(52%), smoking (46%), and obesity (43%) were the three most rec-
ognized risk factors while asthma (8%) and hyperactive thyroid (9%) 
were the least recognized risk factors. In contrast, lack of exercise 
(42%) and high cholesterol (37%) were the most common factors mis-
takenly identified as risk factors for atrial fibrillation.
3.4 | Agreement with atrial fibrillation- 
related  
statements
Figure 2 summarizes the levels of agreement participants had with 
four separate statements about atrial fibrillation. For each statement, 
the proportion of participants providing neutral responses ranged 
from 41% to 46%, suggesting a lack of certainty. Regarding the two 
questions about taking a pulse as a diagnostic method for atrial fibril-
lation, 41% of participants correctly disagreed that “taking your own 
pulse is a reliable way to diagnose atrial fibrillation” but only 32% of 
respondents correctly agreed that “atrial fibrillation can easily be di-
agnosed by a doctor taking your pulse” vs 24% of respondents who 
disagreed. Only a minority of participants (37%) correctly disagreed 
that atrial fibrillation is always treated with surgery. In contrast to an 
earlier question where only 36% of respondents reported awareness 
that atrial fibrillation could cause stroke (Figure 2), 46% (95% CI: 45- 
48%) of respondents agreed with the statement that atrial fibrillation 
could cause a stroke.
3.5 | Indications for anticoagulants
Recognition that anticoagulants play a part in the treatment of atrial 
fibrillation was 31% (95% CI: 29- 
32%). There was relatively high 
awareness that anticoagulants have a part in preventing or treating 
thrombosis (53%, 95% CI: 51- 
54%), stroke (52%, 95% CI: 50- 
54%), 
and myocardial infarction (49%, 95% CI: 47- 
51%), but low recogni-
tion of their roles in preventing complications related to pulmonary 
embolism (31%, 95% CI: 29- 
33%) and deep vein thrombosis (42%, 
95% CI: 40- 
44%). In addition, 27% of participants (95% CI: 26%- 
29%) 
mistakenly thought that anticoagulants are used to prevent high blood 
pressure.

3.6 | Haemo- 
distension syndrome
The overall distribution of awareness of the fictitious haemo- 
distension syndrome was 7% (95% CI: 6- 
8%) and the distribution by 
age, gender, location of residence, and country is shown in Table 2. 
Among those who indicated they were aware of this syndrome, 29% 
(95% CI: 23- 
35%) indicated they were either “very concerned” or “ex-
tremely concerned.”
3.7 | Health messaging organizations
The reported public recognition of three large non- 
profit organi-
zations as sources of health messaging is reported in Table 5. The 
American Heart Association was recognized by the largest proportion 
of respondents (14.7%), while the World Heart Federation and the 
European Society of Cardiology were recognized by 8.4% and 6.4% of 
respondents, respectively.
4 | DISCUSSION
In our sample including representation from 10 countries across six 
continents, we found that global public awareness of atrial fibrillation 
is only 48% (95% CI: 46- 
50%), and substantially lower than awareness 
of hypertension (85%), diabetes (85%), stroke (81%), breast cancer 
(81%), and HIV/AIDS (80%). Not surprisingly, atrial fibrillation aware-
ness was lower among the general public than among patients with 
atrial fibrillation in most countries, such as 78% in Estonia (among 
stroke patients),9 63% in the UK,10 61.9% in Ireland,11 and 60% in the 
US.12 In addition, awareness of atrial fibrillation was significantly as-
sociated with increasing age group, a trend not found with aware-
ness of other conditions. We deliberately focused this survey on those 
40 years of age or older, and especially 60 years or more, because age 
is such a strong risk factor for atrial fibrillation.

The results indicate there is a need to increase public awareness 
that atrial fibrillation is an important risk factor for stroke. In the sec-
tion of the survey in which we asked about awareness of sequela from 
atrial fibrillation, 36% of participants correctly indicated stroke was 
an important sequela. In a subsequent section of the survey, partici-
pants were asked to indicate their level of agreement with four differ-
ent statements, including the statement “Atrial fibrillation can cause 
stroke,” for which 46% either agreed or strongly agreed. Given the 
relatively more leading nature of asking participants to agree with a 
statement compared to selecting an item from a list, we suspect that 
the first question provides a more accurate assessment. However, the 
difference between the two measures is minor and does not affect 
the overall importance of communicating the health message that early 
detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation is a key opportunity to pre-
vent stroke.
From a public health perspective, the finding that only 32% of 
participants agreed with the statement “Atrial fibrillation can be eas-
ily diagnosed by a doctor taking your pulse,” indicates that there is 
an opportunity for healthcare and public health professionals to 
communicate a simple, potentially life- 
saving message that atrial fibril-
lation can be diagnosed relatively easily and inexpensively, and that 
strokes associated with atrial fibrillation can be prevented.
Our results show a relatively high degree of internal and exter-
nal consistency. Evidence of internal consistency includes the low 
proportion of participants (7%) who incorrectly indicated aware-
ness of the fictitious haemo- 
distension syndrome. In addition, 
the results in Table 4 demonstrate that among participants who 
indicated that they were aware of atrial fibrillation, 82% correctly 
identified heart palpitations as a symptom and ≤20% of these 
participants selected incorrect symptoms. Evidence of external 
consistency includes the similarity of the awareness of the other 
selected conditions with the awareness reported in our previous 
global survey, which was conducted in 2014 and was focused on 
venous thromboembolism.7
Some weaknesses deserve comment. First, the online nature of 
the survey restricts respondents to those with internet access. Such 
individuals tend to be younger in age and have more education and 
higher income than those without such access. The age differential 
is illustrated by the fact that no respondents over the age of 61 years 
were recruited in Thailand and none 75 years or older were recruited 
in Argentina. In addition, people who voluntarily participate in online 
surveys/market research may not be representative of the general 
population. We did not collect information about participants’ occu-
pation and therefore cannot assess any potential impact occupation-
al-related knowledge has on participants’ awareness of the surveyed 
diseases. However, the finding that Ugandan health care institutes 
were mentioned more frequently than most other countries’ health 
care facilities (Table 5) prompts us to hypothesize that a dispropor-
tionately large number of health care professionals were among the 
respondents in Uganda. A further limitation is the potentially leading 
nature of survey questions. Although these limitations may result in 
an overestimation of public awareness of atrial fibrillation, they are 
unlikely to result in an underestimation.
In conclusion, there is poor global awareness about atrial fibrilla-
tion. Increasing awareness will empower the public to seek care so

that atrial fibrillation can be diagnosed and treated to lower the risk 
of stroke. By obtaining these baseline measures, we will be poised to 
measure the impact of campaigns aimed at raising awareness, which 
ultimately should reduce the burden of disease. Campaigns such as 
ISTH’s World Thrombosis Day have the potential to make lasting and 
meaningful improvements to people’s lives by increasing awareness of 
atrial fibrillation and other thrombotic conditions.
