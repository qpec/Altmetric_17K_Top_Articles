ABSTRACT The newly emerging Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes a severe respiratory infection
with a high mortality rate (~35%). MERS-CoV has been a global threat due to continuous outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula
and international spread by infected travelers since 2012. From May to July 2015, a large outbreak initiated by an infected trav-
eler from the Arabian peninsula swept South Korea and resulted in 186 confirmed cases with 38 deaths (case fatality rate, 20.4%).
Here, we show the rapid emergence and spread of a mutant MERS-CoV with reduced affinity to the human CD26 receptor dur-
ing the South Korean outbreak. We isolated 13 new viral genomes from 14 infected patients treated at a hospital and found that
12 of these genomes possess a point mutation in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of viral spike (S) protein. Specifically, 11 of
these genomes have an I529T mutation in RBD, and 1 has a D510G mutation. Strikingly, both mutations result in reduced affin-
ity of RBD to human CD26 compared to wild-type RBD, as measured by surface plasmon resonance analysis and cellular binding
assay. Additionally, pseudotyped virus bearing an I529T mutation in S protein showed reduced entry into host cells compared to
virus with wild-type S protein. These unexpected findings suggest that MERS-CoV adaptation during human-to-human spread
may be driven by host immunological pressure such as neutralizing antibodies, resulting in reduced affinity to host receptor, and
thereby impairs viral fitness and virulence, rather than positive selection for a better affinity to CD26.
IMPORTANCE Recently, a large outbreak initiated by an MERS-CoV-infected traveler from the Middle East swept South Korea
and resulted in 186 confirmed cases with 38 deaths. This is the largest outbreak outside the Middle East, and it raised strong con-
cerns about the possible emergence of MERS-CoV mutations. Here, we isolated 13 new viral genomes and found that 12 of them
possess a point mutation in the receptor-binding domain of viral spike protein, resulting in reduced affinity to the human cog-
nate receptor, CD26, compared to the wild-type virus. These unexpected findings suggest that MERS-CoV adaptation in humans
may be driven by host immunological pressure.

M
iddle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV),
a newly emerging zoonotic pathogen first identified in the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 2012, causes an acute and severe
respiratory illness with a high mortality rate in humans (1). As of
20 September 2015, 1,569 laboratory-confirmed human infec-
tions have been reported to the World Health Organization
(WHO), including 554 deaths (case fatality rate, 35.3%) (2). Al-
though the majority of the reported cases are associated with spo-
radic outbreaks in the countries of the Middle East (3), more than
200 cases occurred outside the Middle East region and are primar-
ily linked to recent travel to the Middle East (2). These cases in-
clude an unexpected large outbreak (186 confirmed cases with 38
deaths) in South Korea from May to July 2015 (4). Similar to other
large outbreaks in Saudi Arabia (3, 5), the South Korean MERS
outbreak was mainly associated with health care settings and was
accelerated by interhospital spread (4).
Although early genomic analysis of MERS-CoV revealed that
the respiratory pathogen is closely related to a bat coronavirus
belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus (6), accumulating evi-

 mary source of human infection (7–9). A viral MERS-CoV spike
(S) protein has been suggested to be a critical viral factor for host
tropism via its interaction with a host receptor, CD26 (10, 11), but
the evolutionary pathway of MERS-CoV for human adaptation
remains unclear. The efficacy of direct human-to-human spread
in the community seems to be quite low, as the rate of human
transmission among household contacts of MERS patients has
been approximately 5% based on serological analysis (12). How-
ever, ongoing sporadic outbreaks highlight the importance of
early nosocomial superspreading events in secondary human in-
fections before active case detection and implementation of inter-
ventions (13). There were also typical superspreading events fuel-
ing the unexpected large outbreak in South Korea. The index case
(patient A) returning from the Middle East generated 38 cases of
secondary infections; two patients (patient D and E) of the second
wave of infection or generation were linked to at least 81 and 23
cases of the third generation, respectively (Fig. 1) (4). The rapid
and wide spread of MERS-CoV during the South Korean outbreak
raised strong concerns about the possible generation of mutations
with enhanced sequential human infection. In this study, we ana-
lyzed MERS-CoV genomes isolated from 13 patients admitted to
Chungnam National University Hospital, one of the designated
“national safe hospitals” during the South Korean outbreak and
compared them to recently reported genomes from two South
Korean patients (14, 15) and others deposited in the GenBank
database.
RESULTS
Patients and sample history. The transmission chain of MERS-
CoV and the timeline of potential viral exposure, symptom onset,
and date of genome collection from the patients admitted to
Chungnam National University Hospital are presented in Fig. 1.
This patient pool includes a secondary infection case (patient E)
who had close contact with the index case (patient A) in hospital P.
Eleven cases (patients F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, and P) of the third
wave of infection or generation and two cases (patients R and S) of
the fourth generation are also included in this study. Two (pa-
tients F and G) of 11 tertiary cases visited hospital S, where at least
81 infections occurred, infected by patient D, while the remaining
9 tertiary cases (patients H to P) were patients or care givers at
hospitals D and G where 23 cases were generated by patient E.
Clinical characteristics of the patients, including incubation pe-
riod, fever duration, and the presence of pneumonia, are summa-
rized in Table S1 in the supplemental material. Among the 14
cases, 9 patients completely recovered and 5 patients expired. Fatal
cases include an 82-year-old female and four patients who had
comorbid diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
or liver cirrhosis (Table S1).
Characterization of genomic mutations. We isolated and se-
quenced the whole viral genomes from respiratory secretions
from the 13 patients (Fig. 1). Genome sequences from South Ko-
rean patients B and C that were recently reported by the Republic
of Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Korean
CDC) (GenBank accession number KT029139) (14) and the Chi-
nese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Chinese CDC)
(GenBank accession numbers KT006149 and KT036372) (15), re-
spectively, were also analyzed together with the new viral ge-
nomes. When we compared the viral genomes isolated from the 13
South Korean patients with all the MERS-CoV genomes available
in GenBank as of 20 September 2015 (99 genomes with more than
90% coverage), 26 mutations were found only in the South Ko-
rean isolates (Fig. 2; see Table S2 in the supplemental material).
Fourteen of these mutations are nonsynonymous mutations that
result in changes of amino acids in ORF1a, S, and ORF4b. Six
mutations were observed in ORF1a, seven mutations were ob-
served in the S protein, and there was one deletion mutation in
ORF4b that causes a frameshift and fusion of ORF4b and ORF5.
Four mutations (D977G and G6896S in ORF1a and I529T and
V718I in S) were detected in more than one isolate. We observed
no change at position R1020 of the S protein, which is the only
codon predicted to be under positive selection in the viral genome
(16). It is worth noting that the D510G and I529T mutations in the
receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein (17) result in a
change in amino acid properties: acidic aspartate (D) to hydro-
phobic glycine (G) and hydrophobic isoleucine (I) to polar thre-
onine (T), respectively. Moreover, the mutations in RBD, espe-
cially I529T, emerged in patients of the second generation (patient
E) and spread to the third and fourth generations of patients
within a month (Fig. 1).
FIG 1 Transmission tree and timeline of potential virus exposure, onset of
symptoms, and genome collection. The transmission chain of infection and
the timeline of potential viral exposure, symptom onset, and the date of ge-
nome collection from patients who were epidemiologically linked to the 14
patients (indicated by an asterisk) analyzed in this study are schematically
presented. The wave of infection or generation (first to fourth) is indicated.

 Structural prediction of S RBD mutations. We thus assessed
whether nonsynonymous mutations in the RBD of the S protein
affect interactions with the cognate human receptor, CD26, by
structural analysis. Both mutations (D510G and I529T) are lo-
cated on the interfacial region of the S protein (Fig. 3A). We found
that both mutations introduced energetically unfavorable interac-
tions to the S-protein/CD26 interface. Specifically, D510 of the S
protein is located on the interfacial loop and interacts directly with
CD26 residues (Fig. 3B; see Table S3 in the supplemental mate-
rial). The D510G mutation disrupts the ionic interaction with
R317 of CD26. Moreover, I529 is located on the backside of the
S-protein/CD26 interface (Fig. 3C; Table S4). The I529T mutation
introduces a polar side chain to a hydrophobic residue cluster
(L506, L554, and A556) and therefore potentially affects the ener-
getic stability of the interfacial beta sheets of RBD.
Effects of RBD mutation on CD26 binding and viral entry. In
order to quantify the binding affinity of the mutant RBDs (D510G
and I529T) to CD26, we performed surface plasmon resonance
(SPR) experiments with purified RBD proteins (Fig. 3D). In our
studies, wild-type RBD binds to CD26 with a dissociation con-
stant (Kd) of 64.5 nM (Kon, 1.45 � 104 M�1 s�1; Koff, 9.36 �
10�4 s�1), which is slightly lower but comparable to the 16.7 nM
measured in previous studies (17). The difference might be due to
having fixed CD26 on the chip for the SPR assay, whereas RBD was
fixed in the previous experiment (17). The I529T mutant RBD
binds to CD26 with a Kd of 293 nM (Kon, 4.03 � 103 M�1 s�1; Koff,
1.18 � 10�3 s�1), which is almost 4.5 times lower than wild-type
RBD. In the case of D510G RBD, it binds to CD26 with a Kd of
316 nM (Kon, 5.02 � 103 M�1 s�1; Koff, 1.59 � 10�3 s�1), which is
almost 4.9 times lower than wild-type RBD and as expected by
structural prediction.
To further confirm the reduced affinity, purified RBD mutants
were analyzed for CD26 binding in 293T cells stably expressing
CD26 (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material) by flow cytometry
assay. As shown in Fig. 4A, mutated RBDs bind to 293T cells
overexpressing CD26 with different efficacies. The D510G substi-
tution increased the 50% effective concentration (EC50) by two-
fold (EC50 � 0.24 �g/ml), whereas the EC50 of the I529T RBD
mutant was almost 20 times higher (EC50 � 2.37 �g/ml) than that
of wild-type RBD (EC50 � 0.12 �g/ml). In addition, the maxi-

 mum binding of the two mutant RBDs was saturated at approxi-
mately 80% of wild-type RBD. Finally, we investigated the biolog-
ical relevance of the I529T mutation in S protein by using a
pseudotyped lentivirus bearing the mutant S protein (Fig. 4B).
The I529T mutation in S protein significantly lowered (~25%) the
efficiency of viral entry into 293T cells overexpressing CD26 com-
pared to that of virus bearing wild-type S protein. The basal level
of viral entry in the control cells (293T-vector) was not changed,
and the infectivity of vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSV-
G)-pseudotyped virus was not significantly affected by the expres-
sion of CD26 in the host cells, suggesting that the reduction in viral
entry by the I529T mutation is specifically dependent on its inter-
action with CD26.
DISCUSSION
Considering the genetic stability of the S protein in MERS-CoV
genomes reported thus far (16), it is quite interesting to note the
rapid emergence and subsequent conservation of the RBD I529T
mutation in consecutive human infections. Since it is generally
thought that interspecies transmission of coronaviruses is primar-
ily mediated by mutations in the S protein with enhanced affinity
toward human receptors (18), this unexpected emergence and
wide spread of an RBD mutation with reduced affinity to human
CD26 during human-to-human spread in the South Korean
MERS outbreak raises several critical questions. First, the muta-
tion rate of MERS-CoV may be different during sequential human
spread. Based on the results of our genomic analysis, however,
genomes from each generation have only one to three nucleotide
changes at most (see Table S2 in the supplemental material). In
addition, when we isolated and sequenced two viral genomes in a
patient (patient H) (Fig. 1) separated by a 6-day interval, we failed
to observe any detectable changes (data not shown). It has also
been reported that only a few or no differences were found in
nucleotide sequences between the genomes from samples from a
single patient taken 1 day to 2 weeks later (19, 20). Second, the
mutations in the RBD of S protein might be generated to better
suit polymorphisms of CD26 specific to the South Korean popu-
lation. Indeed, it has been shown that the difference in interface
residues among the host receptors of different mammalian species
is critical to triggering interspecies transmission of coronavirus
(18). However, our preliminary analysis of CD26 sequences en-
coding the interface domain in the South Korean patients failed to
show any substantial difference (data not shown). Third, the mu-
tations observed in the South Korean outbreak could affect the
severity of disease caused by MERS. Since the number of patients
whose viral genomes are currently available is limited, direct dem-
onstration of a correlation is not yet possible; we could not distin-
guish a specific correlation using the epidemiological and clinical
information of the 15 cases listed in Table S1 in the supplemental
material. Functional analyses of the mutations (Fig. 2) in viral
pathogenesis or infectivity need to be performed. Considering
that the case fatality rate (19.9%) of the South Korean outbreak is
lower than the overall mortality rate of all MERS cases (~35%), the
spread of the RBD I529T mutation with reduced affinity to human
CD26 receptor, as well as earlier diagnosis and quarantine during
the outbreak (21), is potentially associated with milder conse-
quences, although the differences in health care settings among
the nations where MERS is endemic need to be taken into account
to make a direct comparison. In addition to mutations in the S
protein, a deletion of three nucleotides (�TTA) in ORF4b (ex-
pired patient K), leading to a fusion of ORF4b and ORF5 (Fig. 1;
Table S2), is notable, since these proteins are known to function as
antagonists of type 1 interferon signaling (22). Finally, is the re-
duced affinity to host receptor CD26 by RBD mutations linked to
transmissibility of MERS-CoV, and how are these viral mutations
selected and maintained during human-to-human transmission?

 Currently, we are not able to calculate and compare the reproduc-
tion rate of MERS-CoV infections during the South Korean out-
break due to the limited availability of information on the patients
infected with the mutant viruses. However, the available s gene
sequences isolated from Korean patients revealed that 72% (18/
25) of the patients, including three superspreaders (patients 1, 14,
and 16), were infected with MERS-CoV carrying the I529T mu-
tated S protein (Fig. 5) (20, 23). Remarkably, wild-type RBD se-
quences were found in several second- and third-generation pa-
tients, and the D510G mutation was found in two patients of the
third and fourth generations (Fig. 5). The original virus carried by
the index patient may have carried the I529T mutation, and it may
have converted to wild-type or mutant viruses bearing the D510G
mutation in the S protein during human-to-human spread. In
order to elucidate the evolutionary pathway of the s gene muta-
tions during sequential human infection, more-detailed analysis
needs to be conducted using genomic sequences isolated from
more South Korean patients. Nevertheless, it was shown that the
South Korean outbreak followed a progression similar to those of
previously described hospital clusters involving coronaviruses,
with early superspreading events generating a disproportionately
large number of secondary and tertiary infections, and the trans-
mission potential diminishing greatly in subsequent generations
(13). It is thought that human adaptation of animal coronavirus
might be achieved through sequential mutations that enhance the
affinity of S protein to the human receptor as demonstrated in
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) evo-
lution (24). However, the results of our current study showing the
rapid and wide spread of an RBD mutant with reduced affinity to
human receptor generates evidence that do not support this hy-
pothesis. Interestingly, previous reports showed that a neutraliz-
ing antibody against MERS-CoV may contribute not only to
MERS-CoV clearance but also to viral evolution (25). Treatment
of a neutralizing antibody to in vitro infection media generated
several escape mutations in the RBD of MERS-CoV; the majority
of the escape mutations had a negative impact on CD26 receptor
binding and viral fitness (25) in line with what we observed in our
current study. It was shown that RBD mutations (L506F, T512A,
Y540C, and R542G) generated by neutralizing antibody pressure
decreases RBD binding affinity to CD26, resulting in a profound
loss of neutralizing antibody binding activity (25). Based on these
results, it was proposed that the immunodominance of human
neutralizing antibody response to RBD-CD26 interface can re-
strict MERS-CoV evolution by driving the virus down an escape
pathway that predominantly results in a significant cost in viral
fitness. Considering that I529T and D510G mutations emerged
and were conserved in the majority of viral genomes isolated from
South Korean patients (Fig. 5), these natural variations with re-
duced affinity to CD26 may also have been produced in response
to neutralizing antibodies exerting an in vivo selection pressure.
FIG 4 Effects of RBD mutations on cellular binding and viral entry. (A)
Analysis of 50% effective concentration (EC50) of RBD mutant proteins bind-
ing to 293T cells expressing CD26. Each purified RBD protein tagged with His
was serially diluted 2-fold (dilutions starting from 4 or 8 �g/ml) and then
incubated with 2 � 105 cells. The binding of the RBD proteins was measured
by flow cytometry analysis after staining with anti-His antibody. The dashed
line indicates 50% of maximum binding of wild-type RBD to 293T-CD26 cells.
(B) The efficiency of viral entry was analyzed on the basis of luciferase activity
in cells infected with pseudotyped viruses bearing the wild-type (WT) or I529T
mutant S protein. The efficiency of viral entry was measured by setting the
luciferase activity in 293T-CD26 cells incubated with pseudotyped virus bear-
ing the wild-type S protein at 100%. VSV-G-pseudotyped virus was used as a
pseudovirus control. This assay was performed in triplicate. 293T-vector cells
are the control cells. Values that are significantly different (P � 0.01) by Stu-
dent’s t test are indicated by a bar and two asterisks.

 Decreased virulence of the neutralization escape mutants also co-
incided with reduced affinity of the mutant SARS S protein for its
ACE2 receptor (26). Further analysis on the interaction of neu-
tralizing antibodies generated in infected patients and the mutant
viruses needs to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ethics statement. MERS-CoV genome sequences were obtained from the
patients’ respiratory samples after ethical approval granted by the institu-
tional review boards of Chungnam National University Hospital and
Seoul National University Hospital. The clinical samples collected for
viral diagnosis before consent of the patients were used for viral sequenc-
ing analysis after the ethical approval. These procedures were approved by
the institutional review boards. All the patients who recovered provided
their written, informed consent to participation. In the cases of patients
who died, we obtained exemption of patients’ consent for the analysis of
viral sequences from the institutional review boards of Chungnam Na-
tional University Hospital and Seoul National University Hospital.
Viral genome analysis. Nucleic acid extracts from PCR-confirmed
MERS patients were processed for reverse transcription and PCR ampli-
fication using a modified version of methods described previously (16).
Briefly, RNAs were extracted from sputum or tracheal aspirate samples
using TRIzol LS reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the man-
ufacturer’s instructions. The MERS-CoV RNA genome was converted to
DNA and amplified by PCR in 30 overlapping amplicons using the primer
sets listed in Table S5 in the supplemental material. All amplicons were gel
purified and sequenced directly using an ABI-3730xl DNA analyzer (Ap-
plied Biosystems), and the contigs were assembled using SeqMan version
7.0 (DNAStar Lasergene, USA). The 13 new genomes were aligned with
the 101 published MERS-CoV genomes using MUSCLE (27) and MEGA6
software (28).
Structural analysis of D510G and I529T mutations. The complex
structure of MERS-CoV spike RBD bound to CD26 (PDB identification
[ID] or accession number 4KR0) were used to analyze the effects of
D510G and I529T mutations (17). Mutations were highlighted using Py-
MOL (http://www.pymol.org). FoldX (http://foldx.crg.es) was used to
calculate the changes in the energetic stability of residues (��G) in wild-
type and mutant RBD structures (29). Interfacial residues in RBD were
identified by the change in solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) greater
than 1 Å2 upon the formation of complexes (30). The SASA of each resi-
due was calculated by using NACCESS (31). The contacts of particular
residues were identified using CSU software (http://ligin.weizmann.ac.il/
lpccsu/) (32).
Protein expression and purification. The human CD26 and MERS-
CoV RBD (wild-type and mutant) proteins used for surface plasmon res-
onance experiments were prepared using the Bac-to-Bac baculovirus ex-
pression system (Invitrogen, Life Technologies). CD26 (residues 39 to
766) and MERS-CoV RBD (spike residues 367 to 606, wild type), which
were kindly provided by George F. Gao, were cloned into pFastBac1 vector
(17), which contains the gp67 signal peptide at the N terminus for protein
secretion and the hexahistidine tag at the C terminus for further protein
purifications. Two MERS-CoV RBD mutants (D510G and I529T) were
generated by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene). CD26 and RBD con-
structs were expressed in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells in a se-
creted form and collected after culture at 27°C for 3 days through centrif-
ugation to remove Sf9 cells. Media were concentrated and adjusted to a
pH of 8.0 before purification. All the proteins were purified using 5 ml
HisTrap HP column (GE Healthcare), with washing buffer (20 mM Tris-
HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole) and elution buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). Finally,
each protein was loaded onto Superdex 200 columns (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl to check
homogeneity.
Surface plasmon resonance assay. The SPR experiments were per-
formed at 25°C by using a ProteOnXPR36 machine with GLC83F10NO1
chip (Bio-Rad). PBST (phosphate-buffered saline containing Tween 20)
buffer (10 mM PO4 [pH 7.4], 2.4 mM KCl, 138 mM NaCl, 0.05% [vol/vol]
Tween 20) was used throughout the SPR experiments. The CD26 protein
was immobilized on the chip with approximately 590 response units. Each
RBD protein (wild-type protein and D510G and I529T mutant proteins)
with gradient concentrations (0, 80, 160, 320, and 640 nM) was prepared
and passed over the chip surface. At the end of each cycle, the chip surface
was regenerated with 10 mM glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). A 1:1 Langmuir bind-
ing model was used to analyze the binding kinetics of each RBD (wild type,
D510G, and I529T) to CD26 protein.
Stable 293T cells expressing human CD26 and RBD binding assay.
Full-length human CD26 protein with a C-terminal hemagglutinin (HA)
tag was cloned into the pEFIRES-P vector to express both CD26 and the
puromycin resistance gene via an internal ribosome entry site sequence
(33). Overexpression of CD26 in 293T cells was confirmed by flow cytom-
etry analysis using anti-human CD26 antibody (BioLegend) after trans-
fection with the plasmid constructs and selection with puromycin (see
Fig. S1 in the supplemental material). RBD-CD26 binding was further
examined by flow cytometry analysis. Purified wild-type or mutant RBD
proteins were serially diluted 2-fold and incubated with 2 � 105 293T cells
overexpressing CD26 in 200 �l of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium
(DMEM) and incubated at 37°C for 1 h. Cells were washed three times
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and stained with rabbit anti-His
antibody (Santa Cruz) and anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488
(Life Technologies) for flow cytometric analysis.
Pseudotyped virus and viral entry. Pseudotyped virus was generated
from 293FT cells (Invitrogen) by cotransfection of human immunodefi-
ciency virus backbone plasmids expressing firefly luciferase as described
previously (34). We used the packaging plasmids (pLP1, pLP2, and pLP/
VSV-G; all from Invitrogen) and pLVX-Luc-IRES-ZsGreen1 (Luc stands
for luciferase, and IRES stands for internal ribosomal entry site) (Clon-
tech). For S-protein pseudotyping, full-length cDNA of the s gene (Sino
Biological Inc.) was cloned into pcDNA3 and used for transfection instead
of pLP/VSV-G. A plasmid carrying the gene encoding the I529T mutation
in S protein was generated by using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene)
based on the wild-type construct, and the point mutation was confirmed
by sequencing. Viral supernatants were harvested 48 h after transfection
and normalized by p24 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit
(Clontech) before infecting 293T cells for viral entry assay. The infected
293T cells were lysed 48 h after infection, and the efficiency of viral entry
was measured by comparing the luciferase activity between pseudotyped
viruses bearing the wild-type or mutant S protein (34). VSV-G-
pseudotyped lentivirus was used as the positive control. The relative lu-
ciferase activity in cell lysates was measured using a luciferase assay kit
(Promega) and Infinite 200 PRO microplate reader (Tecan).
