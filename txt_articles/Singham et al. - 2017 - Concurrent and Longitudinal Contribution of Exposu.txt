IMPORTANCE Exposure to bullying is associated with poor mental health. However, the
degree to which observed associations reflect direct detrimental contributions of exposure
to bullying to mental health remains uncertain, as noncausal relationships may arise from
genetic and environmental confounding (eg, preexisting vulnerabilities). Determining to what
extent exposure to bullying contributes to mental health is an important concern, with
implications for primary and secondary interventions.
OBJECTIVE To characterize the concurrent and longitudinal contribution of exposure to
bullying to mental health in childhood and adolescence using a twin differences design
to strengthen causal inference.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Participants were drawn from the Twins Early
Development Study, a population-based cohort recruited from population records of births in
England and Wales between January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1996. Data collection took
place when the participants were between 11 and 16 years of age from December 1, 2005, to
January 31, 2013. Data analysis was conducted from January 1, 2016, to June 20, 2017.
EXPOSURES Participants completed the Multidimensional Peer-Victimization Scale at 11 and
14 years of age.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Mental health assessments at 11 and 16 years of age
included anxiety, depression, hyperactivity and impulsivity, inattention, conduct problems,
and psychotic-like experiences (eg, paranoid thoughts or cognitive disorganization).
RESULTS The 11 108 twins included in the final sample (5894 girls and 5214 boys) were a
mean age of 11.3 years at the first assessment and 16.3 years at the last assessment. The most
stringent twin differences estimates (monozygotic) were consistent with causal contribution
of exposure to bullying at 11 years to concurrent anxiety, depression, hyperactivity and
impulsivity, inattention, and conduct problems. Effects decreased over time; that is,
substantial concurrent contributions to anxiety (β = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.22-0.33) persisted for
2 years (β=0.12; 95% CI, 0.04-0.20) but not 5 years. Direct contributions to paranoid
thoughts and cognitive disorganization persisted for 5 years.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This study is the largest to date to characterize the
contribution of exposure to bullying in childhood to mental health using a twin differences
design and multi-informant, multiscale data. Stringent evidence of the direct detrimental
contribution of exposure to bullying in childhood to mental health is provided. Findings also
suggest that childhood exposure to bullying may partly be viewed as a symptom of
preexisting vulnerabilities. Finally, the dissipation of effects over time for many outcomes
highlights the potential for resilience in children who were bullied. In addition to programs
that aim to reduce exposure to bullying, interventions may benefit from addressing
preexisting vulnerabilities and focus on resilience.

ne-thirdofchildrenreporthavingbeenbulliedbytheir
peers according to estimates from the World Health
Organization.1 Childhood exposure to bullying refers to
the experience of being a target of hostile behavior from other
children (eg, being physically or verbally attacked)2; it is as-
sociated with a wide range of long-lasting adverse outcomes,
particularly mental health outcomes such as anxiety.3-5 A key
challenge for current research is to probe the causal nature of
these widespread associations.
Whether cross-sectional or longitudinal, most available
studies remain correlational and fall short of being able to in-
fer causality. In particular, most studies are not genetically in-
formative and do not account for genetic confounding. This is-
sue is problematic given that genetic influences account for up
to two-thirds of the variation in exposure to bullying, suggest-
ing that being bullied is influenced by preexisting heritable in-
dividual vulnerabilities.6 For example, prior mental health dif-
ficulties, personality, or cognitive deficits may increase the
likelihoodofbeingbullied.7-9Thesamesetofvulnerabilitiesmay
alsoconferanincreasedriskofdevelopingadversementalhealth
outcomes later in life. Such person-environment correlations
between individual vulnerabilities and exposure to bully-
ing—or gene-environment correlation when driven by genetic
factors10—can generate associations that do not entirely re-
flect a causal contribution of childhood exposure to bullying.
To establish causality, experimental designs randomly al-
locating children to different degrees of exposure to bullying
are clearly precluded for ethical reasons. The strongest re-
maining design is an observational approach based on the
counterfactual framework for causal inference.11,12 The coun-
terfactual framework stipulates that, to assess the effect of
being exposed to a risk factor (eg, exposure to bullying), an ex-
posedindividualshouldideallybematchedwithhisorhernon-
exposedself.Becauseexposedindividualsarethesameascon-
trol individuals in this ideal scenario, all possible sources of
genetic and environmental confounding are controlled for.
Naturally, an individual cannot be exposed and not exposed
to a risk factor at the same time. Therefore, causal inference
methodsaimtoapproximatethisidealscenario.Onesuchpow-
erful method is the twin differences design, in which one twin
is used as a control for the other, thereby accounting for shared
environmental and genetic sources of confounding, in part for
dizygotic (DZ) twins and fully for monozygotic (MZ) twins.
Because of small sample sizes, twin studies on childhood
exposure to bullying have not fully implemented this co-
twin design (which requires obtaining separate DZ and MZ es-
timates) except for 2 studies.13,14 Arseneault et al13 found that
MZ twins who experienced being bullied between the ages of
7 and 9 years (assessed by mothers at age 10 years) had sig-
nificantly more internalizing problems at age 10 years than did
their co-twin. Recently, Silberg et al14 examined the contribu-
tion of being bullied by peers in childhood to psychiatric dis-
orders in childhood and young adulthood. In MZ analyses, sig-
nificant concurrent contributions of exposure to bullying were
found for anxiety and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disor-
der in childhood and for suicidal ideation in young adulthood
(but not in childhood). Owing to sample size, these analyses
were conducted only on a subset of available psychiatric out-
comes. In addition, contrasting concurrent vs long-term con-
tributions of childhood exposure to bullying was not possible
for most outcomes. Finally, binary measures of bullying across
both studies limited power and the ability to study different
dimensions of childhood exposure to bullying.
To our knowledge, our study is the largest prospective
study to date to use a stringent, genetically informative de-
sign to test the degree to which childhood exposure to bully-
ing contributes to mental health difficulties and test whether
direct contributions of exposure to bullying persist over time.
To this end, we used a multidimensional measure of child-
hood exposure to bullying assessing different forms of bully-
ing (physical, verbal, social, and property-related) as well as
comprehensive multi-informant, multiscale assessments of
mental health. Outcomes included anxiety, depression, hy-
peractivityandimpulsivity,inattention,conductproblems,and
psychotic-like experiences.
Methods
Participants
Participants were drawn from the Twins Early Development
Study (TEDS) and were born in England and Wales between
January 1, 1994, and December 31, 1996 (details in eTable 1 in
the Supplement and elsewhere15). The 11 108 twins included
in the final sample (5894 girls and 5214 boys) were a mean age
of 11.3 years at the first assessment and 16.3 years at the last
assessment. The number of twins for each outcome ranged
from 11 108 to 4706 (subsample at 14 years of age) depending
on age, informant, and number of pairs with data available for
childhood exposure to bullying and each outcome. Data col-
lection took place when the participants were between 11 and
16 years of age from December 1, 2005, to January 31, 2013.
Written informed consent was obtained from all participat-
ing families. This study was approved by the Institute of Psy-
chiatry, Kings College London, Ethics Committee.
Measures
Childhood exposure to bullying was measured using the self-
report version of the Multidimensional Peer-Victimization
Scale16 at 11 and 14 years of age. This 16-item measure com-
prises the following 4 subscales: physical bullying (eg, “Kicked
Key Points
Question What is the concurrent and longitudinal contribution of
exposure to bullying in childhood to mental health?
Findings This population-based cohort study using a twin
differences design (11 108 twins) provides evidence that childhood
exposure to bullying directly contributes to multiple mental health
domains, particularly anxiety, depression, paranoid thoughts, and
cognitive disorganization. This direct contribution dissipates or is
reduced after 5 years.
Meaning In addition to primary prevention aiming to stop
childhood exposure to bullying, secondary preventive
interventions should support resilience processes and address
prior vulnerabilities in children exposed to bullying.

 me”), verbal bullying (eg, “Called me names”), social manipu-
lation (eg, “Tried to make my friends turn against me”), and
property attacks (eg, “Tried to break something of mine”). The
twins rated how often they experienced events mentioned
under each item during the past year on a 3-point scale (0 = not
at all, 1 = once, and 2 = more than once). Cronbach α was 0.91
for the total scale and 0.80 to 0.84 for subscales.
Outcomes were measured at 11 and 16 years of age and in-
cludedtotalmentalhealthdifficulties,anxiety,depression,hy-
peractivityandimpulsivity,inattention,conductproblems,and
psychotic-like experiences (ie, paranoid thoughts, hallucina-
tions, grandiosity, cognitive disorganization, anhedonia, and
negative symptoms). The questionnaires are described in
Table 1,17-22 and Table 2 and Table 3 detail each outcome: tim-
ing of assessment, scale(s), and informant(s). eTables 2 and 3
in the Supplement contain findings from teacher ratings and
outcomes that were excluded from main analyses (prosocial
behavior and peer problems).
Statistical Analyses
StatisticalanalysiswasconductedfromJanuary1,2016,toJune
20, 2017. Three main types of estimates of the relationship be-
tween childhood exposure to bullying and each outcome were
obtained:unadjustedphenotypicestimate,estimatefromtwin
differences in DZ same-sex twins, and estimate from twin dif-
ferences in MZ twins.23,24
For phenotypic estimates on the entire sample, the non-
independence within twin pairs was accounted for by allow-
ing for a within-twin correlation.23 Maximum likelihood esti-
mates were obtained in the Structural Equation Modeling
Lavaan package, version 0.5-20, in R.25 For DZ and MZ esti-
mates, an ordinary least square through origin regression (ie,
without the intercept) was conducted, regressing within-twin
differences in outcomes on within-twin differences in child-
hoodexposuretobullying.23Positiveregressionestimatesmean
that the twin who was more exposed to bullying also pre-
sented with higher levels of mental health difficulties. To ac-
count for nonnormality and nonindependence, robust 95% CIs
were obtained by bootstrapping (10 000 repetitions).
Dizygotic twins share 50% of their segregated genes on av-
erage and 100% of shared environmental influences. Similar to
a fixed-effect sibling design, DZ estimates are therefore more
stringentthanphenotypicestimatesbecausetheyaccountpartly
for genetic confounding (eg, prior genetically influenced indi-
vidualvulnerabilities)andaccountcompletelyforsharedenvi-
ronmental influences. Monozygotic twins share 100% of their
genes and shared environmental influences; therefore, MZ es-
timatesrepresentafurtherimprovementcomparedwithDZes-
timates.Althoughtheyareextremelystringent,MZanalysesdo
notaccountforwithin-twindifferencesthatcanarisefromnon-
shared environmental factors preceding exposure to bullying.
For example, a preexisting vulnerability for anxiety caused by
nonshared environmental factors in one twin compared to his
or her co-twin may at the same time evoke exposure to higher
levels of bullying and explain later levels of anxiety. For each

Results
The Figure provides an illustration of the 3 types of estimates—
phenotypic, DZ, and MZ—for the concurrent, 2-year, and 5-year
analyses. Based on the total mental health difficulties score,
the Figure also illustrates key patterns of the study findings.
First, the decrease in effect sizes from phenotypic to DZ and
MZ estimates shows the importance of shared environmental
and/or genetic confounding in explaining observed associa-
tions. Despite this decrease, MZ estimates remained signifi-
cant for the concurrent and 2-year analyses, supporting an as-
sociation between childhood exposure to bullying and total
difficulties. Second, this direct contribution of childhood ex-
posure to bullying decreased as time from the exposure
increased. Findings for all outcomes are presented below in
chronological order.
Concurrent Estimates
Table 2 presents phenotypic, DZ, and MZ concurrent esti-
mates at 11 years of age arranged by outcome, age, scale, and
informant. Findings from teacher ratings (eTable 2 in the

 relationships remained significant when controlling for all
shared environmental influences and half of the genetic in-
fluences in DZ analyses. Monozygotic estimates were consis-
tent with a causal influence of childhood exposure to bully-
ing on the total difficulty score, depression, and anxiety across
all informants. In addition, MZ estimates were also signifi-
cant for child-rated conduct problems, child-rated hyperac-
tivity and inattention symptoms as measured by the Strengths
and Difficulties Questionnaire,17 and parent-rated inatten-
tion (but not hyperactivity and impulsivity) from the Con-
ners scale.21 Findings were similar when further controlling for
prior within-twin differences (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Two-Year Estimates (Subsample Analysis)
Findings and descriptives for 2-year estimates (from expo-
sure to bullying at 14 years of age to outcomes at 16 years of
age) are in Table 3 and eTables 3 and 7 in the Supplement. All
phenotypic estimates remained significant. Effect sizes
tended to lie between the concurrent and 5-year estimates
(Figure). In MZ analyses, the total difficulty score, child-
rated and parent-rated anxiety on 3 different scales
(Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, Childhood Anxi-
ety Sensitivity Index, and Anxiety-Related Behaviors Ques-
tionnaire), paranoid thoughts, hallucinations, and cognitive
disorganization were significant. When further controlling
for prior within-twin differences (eTable 8 in the Supple-
ment), child-rated and parent-rated anxiety, paranoid
thoughts, and cognitive disorganization remained signifi-
cant (for paranoid thoughts and cognitive disorganization,
there were no prior corresponding measures, so the total dif-
ficulty score was used instead).
Five-Year Estimates
Findings and descriptives for 5-year estimates (from expo-
sure to bullying at 11 years of age to outcomes at 16 years of
age) are in Table 2 and eTables 2 and 9 in the Supplement.
All phenotypic estimates remained significant, although
they were smaller than concurrent and 2-year estimates.
However, in the MZ analyses, only paranoid thoughts, cogni-
tive disorganization, and the total score and inattention
score on the Conners scale were still significant. The total
score and inattention score on the Conners scale did not sur-
vive additional control for early within-twin differences in
these behaviors (eTable 10 in the Supplement).
Additional Analyses
Analyses for the physical subscale are in eTables 11 to 13 in the
Supplement, analyses for the verbal subscale are in eTables 14
to 16 in the Supplement, analyses for the social subscale are
ineTables17to19intheSupplement,andanalysesfortheprop-
erty-related subscale are in eTables 20 to 22 in the Supple-
ment. Intercorrelations between subscales are in eTables 23
and 24 in the Supplement. Overall, findings for the 4 sub-
scales were consistent with findings for the total exposure to
bullying score in terms of significance and timing of direct con-
tributions, particularly for physical and social bullying. We
found no robust evidence of moderation by sex or nonlinear
relationships (eTables 25-27 in the Supplement).
Discussion
We have provided stringent evidence that childhood expo-
sure to bullying directly contributes to multiple mental health
domains. In particular, findings were consistent across mul-
tiple informants and multiple scales for concurrent depres-
sion and anxiety. Increased levels of anxiety persisted in the
short term (2 years), while findings indicated a small but en-
during contribution of exposure to bullying in childhood to
paranoid thoughts and cognitive disorganization.
Exposure to Bullying and Mental Health:
Confounding and Causation
In line with extant research, we found widespread pheno-
typicassociationsbetweenchildhoodexposuretobullyingand
mental health, with all estimates being significant. Most esti-
mates were reduced but remained significant in analyses of DZ
twin differences. However, few estimates survived the most
stringent MZ analyses, which control entirely for shared en-
vironmental and genetic influences, particularly when fur-
ther controlling for preexisting individual mental health vul-
nerabilities. Overall, this pattern of findings suggests that
reported associations between childhood exposure to bully-
ing and mental health outcomes likely reflect, at least in part,
multiple vulnerabilities of bullied individuals rather than a
causal contribution of childhood exposure to bullying. Fur-
thermore, all phenotypic estimates but very few MZ esti-
mates remained significant in the 5-year period. Causal con-
tributions may therefore be shorter lived than confounded
associations. These findings underscore recent calls for the use
of more stringent causal inference designs in developmental
psychiatry,26-28particularlywhenassessingthelong-termcon-
sequences of childhood exposure to bullying.9,29
The MZ twin differences design provided strong evi-
dence of the concurrent contribution of exposure to bullying
in childhood to the total difficulty score, depression, and anxi-
ety.Findingswereconsistentacrossinformantsandscales.The
2previousdiscordantMZtwinstudiesreportedsignificantcon-
tributions to overall internalizing problems13 as well as social
and separation anxiety14 in childhood. We also found evi-
dence of a concurrent contribution of exposure to bullying in
childhood to hyperactivity and inattention symptoms, as well
as conduct problems. However, these contributions were not
consistent across scales and informants and should be inter-
preted with caution. One previous MZ discordant twin study
also found a concurrent contribution to attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder but not to conduct disorder, and did not
examinelong-termcontributionsforthese2outcomes.14Taken
together, these findings represent the most stringent evi-
dence to date, to our knowledge, of the immediate detrimen-
tal contribution of exposure to bullying to children’
s mental
health. In addition, beyond the documented genetic correla-
tion between childhood exposure to bullying and paranoid
thoughts,30 our twin differences analyses suggest that expo-
suretobullyinginchildhoodaffectsparanoidthoughtsandcog-
nitive disorganization in adolescence, although this may not
persist into adulthood.31

 The present findings can guide targeted research aiming
to uncover mechanisms underlying the contribution of expo-
sure to bullying in childhood to anxiety, paranoid thoughts,
and cognitive disorganization. Promising candidate mecha-
nisms can be investigated at multiple levels: altered neuro-
cognitive profiles in children who experience bullying (eg,
modification in threat and trust processing leading to para-
noid thinking), alterations in brain response (eg, stress axis),
or epigenetic mechanisms.32,33
Childhood Exposure to Bullying and Resilience
As time elapsed from exposure, the direct contributions of ex-
posure to bullying in childhood to mental health dissipated.
Most contributions were not maintained after 2 years. Particu-
larly striking were the strong concurrent contributions to anxi-
ety that were reduced but still present across informants af-
ter2years,whichhaddissipatedentirelyafter5years.Similarly,
direct contributions to paranoid thoughts and cognitive dis-
organization were smaller for the 5-year vs the 2-year period.
This pattern of findings highlights the potential for resilience
in children exposed to bullying. Consequently, a more hope-
fulmessagecanbedeliveredtochildrenandfamilies,acknowl-
edging the suffering endured by children being bullied, while
supporting resilience processes on their path to recovery. Fur-
ther studies should seek to establish fine-grained timing to-
ward resilience. Kelleher et al34 reported a decrease in psy-
chotic-likeexperiencesasrapidlyas3monthsafterthebullying
had ceased. Furthermore, future studies should aim to iden-
tify protective modifiable factors, such as school support, that
may facilitate rapid recovery.35
Implications for Interventions
Interventions designed to prevent exposure to bullying re-
main important to avoid prolonged exposure to an experi-
ence that can induce anxiety and depression. However, such
interventions have not proven to be universally effective in re-
ducing the level of exposure to bullying,36 and complemen-
tary approaches are required to best help children and young
people. Our findings highlight the importance of preexisting
vulnerabilities (eg, previous mental health difficulties), which
in part account for the associations between childhood expo-
sure to bullying and mental health. Exposure to bullying may
beviewednotonlyasacauseofadversementalhealthbutmay
also in part represent a “symptom” of preexisting vulnerabili-
ties. This finding has implications for secondary prevention
of mental health difficulties in children exposed to bullying.
Specifically, we must be mindful in any prevention effort that
our goal should be not only to stop the bullying but also to ad-
dress potential preexisting vulnerabilities to improve mental
health in the long term. We propose that combining pro-
grams of childhood bullying prevention as well as individual
work with vulnerable children by addressing existing mental
health problems and promoting resilience will yield the best
outcomes. Such work must be undertaken sensitively to en-
sure that children exposed to childhood bullying are not in any
way seen as responsible for being bullied. Rather, these find-
ings simply indicate what is commonly understood in clini-
cal and educational settings: that some children are more vul-
nerable and require greater support to meet their full potential.
Limitations
This study has some limitations. Although it is considerably
more stringent than nongenetically informative observational
designs, the twin differences design does not account for non-
shared environmental confounding factors, which might exag-
gerate the contribution of childhood exposure to bullying. To
reduce this bias, we adjusted for prior within-pair differences
inmentalhealthdifficulties.However,suchpriormeasureswere
notavailableforalloutcomes,particularlyforparanoidthoughts
and cognitive disorganization. It is therefore possible that pre-
existingparanoidtendenciesowingtononsharedenvironmen-
tal factors affected the reporting of exposure to bullying. Al-
though we carefully considered the possibility of nonshared
environmental confounding, we were unable to control ad-
equatelyforotherformsofbullying(eg,sexualbullying),which
might have overestimated the independent role of childhood
exposure to bullying. In addition, multiple-informant, multi-
scale assessments were not available for all outcomes. There-
fore, we could not account for shared method variance bias
equally well for all outcomes. Despite modest differences in
demographic characteristics between the samples used in the
analyses, the level of attrition may have influenced the find-
ings. Finally, our findings do not entirely preclude the exis-
tence of long-term causal relationships, as childhood expo-
sure to bullying may contribute to unmeasured mental health
outcomes10 and outcomes outside mental health,29,37 and con-
tributions may be limited to subpopulations.
Conclusions
We reported robust evidence of the direct contribution of ex-
posuretobullyinginchildhoodtosymptomsofdepressionand
anxiety, as well as indications of a contribution to paranoid
thoughts and cognitive disorganization. Our finding that this
direct contribution dissipated or reduced over time high-
lights the potential for resilience in children exposed to bul-
lying. This finding also highlights the need for further inves-
tigationsintomechanismsofresiliencethatcouldbeharnessed
in future interventions. In addition to primary prevention aim-
ing to stop exposure to bullying, secondary preventive inter-
ventions in children exposed to bullying should address prior
vulnerabilities, such as mental health difficulties, if we are to
achieve a long-term impact on mental health.
