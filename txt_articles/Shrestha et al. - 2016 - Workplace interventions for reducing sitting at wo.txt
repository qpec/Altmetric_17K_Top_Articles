Background
Office work has changed considerably over the previous couple of decades and has become sedentary in nature. Physical inactivity at
workplaces and particularly increased sitting has been linked to increase in cardiovascular disease, obesity and overall mortality.
Objectives
To evaluate the effects of workplace interventions to reduce sitting at work compared to no intervention or alternative interventions.
Search methods
We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE,
PsycINFO, Clinical trials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP)
search portal up to 2 June, 2015. We also screened reference lists of articles and contacted authors to find more studies to include.
Selection criteria
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), and quasi-randomised controlled trials
of interventions to reduce sitting at work. For changes of workplace arrangements, we also included controlled before-and-after studies
(CBAs) with a concurrent control group. The primary outcome was time spent sitting at work per day, either self-reported or objectively
measured by means of an accelerometer-inclinometer. We considered energy expenditure, duration and number of sitting episodes
lasting 30 minutes or more, work productivity and adverse events as secondary outcomes.
Data collection and analysis
Two review authors independently screened titles, abstracts and full-text articles for study eligibility. Two review authors independently
extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We contacted authors for additional data where required.
Main results
We included 20 studies, two cross-over RCTs, 11 RCTs, three cRCTs and four CBAs, with a total of 2180 participants from high
income nations. The studies evaluated physical workplace changes (nine studies), policy changes (two studies), information and
counselling (seven studies) and interventions from multiple categories (two studies). One study had both physical workplace changes

 and information and counselling components. We did not find any studies that had investigated the effect of periodic breaks or standing
or walking meetings.
Physical workplace changes
A sit-stand desk alone compared to no intervention reduced sitting time at work per workday with between thirty minutes to two
hours at short term (up to three months) follow-up (six studies, 218 participants, very low quality evidence). In two studies, sit-
stand desks with additional counselling reduced sitting time at work in the same range at short-term follow-up (61 participants, very
low quality evidence). One study found a reduction at six months’ follow-up of -56 minutes (95% CI -101 to -12, very low quality
evidence) compared to no intervention. Also total sitting time at work and outside work decreased with sit-stand desks compared to
no intervention (MD -78 minutes, 95% CI -125 to -31, one study) as did the duration of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more
(MD -52 minutes, 95% CI -79 to -26, two studies). This is considerably less than the two to four hours recommended by experts.
Sit-stand desks did not have a considerable effect on work performance, musculoskeletal symptoms or sick leave. It remains unclear if
standing can repair the harms of sitting because there is hardly any extra energy expenditure.
The effects of active workstations were inconsistent. Treadmill desks combined with counselling reduced sitting time at work (MD
-29 minutes, 95% CI -55 to -2, one study) compared to no intervention at 12 weeks’ follow-up. Pedalling workstations combined
with information did not reduce inactive sitting at work considerably (MD -12 minutes, 95% CI -24 to 1, one study) compared to
information alone at 16 weeks’ follow-up. The quality of evidence was low for active workstations.
Policy changes
Two studies with 443 participants provided low quality evidence that walking strategies did not have a considerable effect on workplace
sitting time at 10 weeks’ (MD -16 minutes, 95% CI -54 to 23) or 21 weeks’ (MD -17 minutes, 95% CI -58 to 25) follow-up respectively.
Information and counselling
Counselling reduced sitting time at work (MD -28 minutes, 95% CI -52 to -5, two studies, low quality evidence) at medium term
(three months to 12 months) follow-up. Mindfulness training did not considerably reduce workplace sitting time (MD -2 minutes,
95% CI -22 to 18) at six months’ follow-up and at 12 months’ follow-up (MD -16 minutes, 95% CI -45 to 12, one study, low quality
evidence). There was no considerable increase in work engagement with counselling.
There was an inconsistent effect of computer prompting on sitting time at work. One study found no considerable effect on sitting
at work (MD -17 minutes, 95% CI -48 to 14, low quality evidence) at 10 days’ follow-up, while another study reported a significant
reduction in sitting at work (MD -55 minutes, 95% CI -96 to -14, low quality evidence) at 13 weeks’ follow-up. Computer prompts
to stand reduced sitting at work by 14 minutes more (95% CI 10 to 19, one study) compared to computer prompts to step at six days’
follow-up. Computer prompts did not change the number of sitting episodes that last 30 minutes or longer.
Interventions from multiple categories
Interventions combining multiple categories had an inconsistent effect on sitting time at work, with a reduction in sitting time at 12
weeks’ (25 participants, very low quality evidence) and six months’ (294 participants, low quality evidence) follow-up in two studies but
no considerable effect at 12 months’ follow-up in one study (MD -47.98, 95% CI -103 to 7, 294 participants, low quality evidence).
Authors’ conclusions
At present there is very low to low quality evidence that sit-stand desks may decrease workplace sitting between thirty minutes to two
hours per day without having adverse effects at the short or medium term. There is no evidence on the effects in the long term. There
were no considerable or inconsistent effects of other interventions such as changing work organisation or information and counselling.
There is a need for cluster-randomised trials with a sufficient sample size and long term follow-up to determine the effectiveness of
different types of interventions to reduce objectively measured sitting time at work.

Workplace interventions for reducing sitting time at work
Why is the amount of time spent sitting at work important?

Workplace interventions for reducing sitting at work (Review)

 Physical inactivity at work, particularly sitting has increased in recent years. Long periods of sitting increase the risk for obesity, heart
disease, and overall mortality. It is unclear whether interventions that aim to reduce sitting at workplaces are effective at reducing the
amount of time spent sitting.
The purpose of this review
We wanted to find out the effects of interventions aimed at reducing sitting time at work. We searched the literature in various databases
up to 2 June 2015.
What trials did the review find?
We found twenty studies with a total of 2174 participants from high income nations. Nine studies evaluated physical changes in the
workplace, four evaluated changes in workplace policy, seven studies evaluated information and counselling interventions and one
study evaluated both physical workplace changes and information and counselling components.
Effect of sit-stand desks
Sit-stand desks alone decreased workplace sitting with about half an hour to two hours per day. When combined with information and
counselling sit-stand desks reduced sitting at work in the same range. Sit-stand desks also reduced total sitting time (both at work and
outside work) and the duration of sitting episodes that last 30 minutes or longer.
Effect of active workstations
Treadmill desks combined with counselling reduced sitting time at work compared to no intervention. Pedalling workstations combined
with information did not reduce sitting at work compared to information alone.
Effect of walking during breaks
The introduction of walking during breaks in two studies with 443 participants did not change sitting time.
Effect of information and counselling
In two studies counselling decreased sitting time with 28 minutes and in another study mindfulness training did not have any effect
on sitting at work. There was no considerable increase in work engagement with counselling.
Computer prompting software did not reduce sitting time in two studies. In another study computer prompts reduced sitting time
with 55 minutes compared to no intervention. One study found that prompts to stand reduced sitting 14 minutes more than prompts
to step. Computer prompts did not change the number of sitting episodes that last 30 minutes or longer.
Interventions from multiple categories
When multiple categories of interventions were combined to decrease sitting, there was reduction in workplace sitting time at 12 weeks’
and six months’ follow-up but there was no considerable difference between intervention and control group at 12 months’ follow-up.
Conclusions
The quality of evidence was very low to low for most interventions mainly because studies were very poorly designed and because they
had very few participants. We conclude that at present there is very low quality evidence that sit-stand desks can reduce sitting at work
at the short term. There is no evidence for other types of interventions. We need research to assess the effectiveness of different types
of interventions for decreasing sitting at workplaces in the long term.

Description of the condition
The nature of office work has changed considerably over the last
couple of decades such that workers do not have to move from
their work stations even for simple activities like communicating
with colleagues or storing information in files (VicHealth 2012).
Advancement in technology (e.g. robotics, computers) has made
work easier and more efficient than before, and it has led to a de-
crease in physical strain at workplaces (Craig 2002). Consequently
workers have become less physically active at their workplace com-
pared to their leisure time (Franklin 2011; McCrady 2009; Parry
2013; Thorp 2012; van Uffelen 2010). According to a study by
McCrady 2009, office employees sit on average 100 minutes more
on workdays than on leisure days.
Sitting at work and conducting one’s assigned work tasks whilst
seated involves energy expenditure of 1.5 METs or less. Energy
expenditure involved in various tasks is measured in metabolic
equivalents (METs). One MET is the resting energy, i.e. energy
cost of resting quietly, defined as an oxygen uptake of 3.5 mL kg
−1 min−1(Ainsworth 2000). Reduction in sitting usually results
in an increase in physical activity of light to moderate intensity
like standing or walking (Mansoubi 2014).
In high-income countries like the USA and the UK, since 2000,
the average amount of occupational physical activity has declined
from 125 MET hours per week to 75 MET hours per week. If a
person works 40 hours per week and his estimated energy expendi-
ture is three METs per hour, then his or her total estimated expen-
diture is 120 MET hours per week. However, in low- and middle-
income countries average occupational physical activity declined
from round 220 MET hours per week to 180 MET hours per week
over the same period. The largest decline in occupational physical
activity has been seen in China where it has declined from 240
MET hours per week to 160 MET hours per week since 2000 (Ng
2012). This decline in occupational physical activity can largely
be attributed to an increase in physical inactivity, especially sitting
at the workplace.
Ryan 2011 found that office-based employees spent 66% of their
total time spent at work sitting, of which 5% of sitting events and
25% of sitting time was in single duration events that lasted longer
than 55 minutes.
Increase in time spent sitting at work has increased the risk of
cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes and total mortality, even if
one is engaged in recommended levels of physical activity during
leisure (Chau 2014a; Craft 2012; Dunstan 2011). There is a 5%
increase in risk of obesity and 7% increase in risk of diabetes with
each two-hour per day increase in sitting time at work (Hu 2003).
Those who sit for eight to 11 hours per day are at a 15% increased
risk of death in the next three years than those who sit for less than
four hours per day. This risk increases to 40% for those who sit for
more than 11 hours per day (Van der Ploeg 2012). So employees
should be encouraged not only to do exercise during commuting
to work and during leisure, but also to maintain their intermittent
levels of non-exercise daily activities.
Replacing sitting with physical activity of light (from 1.6 METs
to 2.9 METs) to moderate (3 METs to 5.9 METs; Ainsworth
2011)intensityimprovesinsulinsensitivityof tissues,andresultsin
improvedmetabolismof glucose. Italsoincreaseslipoproteinlipase
activity that breaks down triglycerides and enhances their uptake
into cells (Franklin 2011; Healy 2008). These benefits are seen
especially when sitting is replaced with activity of light to moderate
intensity like standing and walking, instead of vigorous activity
of fixed duration of equal energy expenditure (Duvivier 2013).
Reducing and breaking up the time that people spend sitting while
at work will improve health (Gilson ND 2011; Hamilton 2008;
Healy 2008; Rutten 2013).
Description of the intervention
Globally, it is estimated that 60% of world’s population is part
of the workforce and spends 60% of their waking hours at work.
Thus it is possible to influence the health behaviour of a large
proportion of the adult population through workplace interven-
tions (WHO/WEF 2008). Interventions for reducing sitting time
at work can involve various types of physical activity of light to
moderate intensity.
Workplaces have the advantage of in-built social support, meaning
active collaboration of employees in making sustainable changes
to attain a healthy life-style, and do not require a high degree
of individual effort and motivation. Therefore, the changes in
lifestyle achieved at work are thought to be sustainable in the long
term (Plotnikoff 2012).
Workers can be encouraged to be more physically active through
changes in the workplace environment and design. An ordinary
office desk can be replaced with a sit-stand desk or a so-called hot
desk, which is height adjustable and allows the user to alternate
posture between sitting and standing (Alkhajah 2012; Gilson ND
2012; Straker 2013), or a vertical workstation that allows the use
of a personal computer while walking on a treadmill at a self-se-
lected velocity (Levine 2007), or a stepping/pedalling/desk cycle
device placed under the desk that allows the user to pedal while
being seated at work (McAlpine 2007), or an inflated balloon chair
or a therapy ball (Beers 2008; USPTO 2000). Replacing ordinary
office chairs with inflated balloon chairs makes the act of sitting
more physically active by increasing the need to use the abdom-
inal, back, leg and thigh muscles to remain upright and main-
tain balance. Sitting can also be decreased by changing the lay-
out of workplaces, for example placing printers further away from
desks. Office work can also be made more physically demanding
by forming walking or other exercise groups like dance or gym
groups during work time (Ogilvie 2007; Thogersen-Ntoumani
2013), by encouraging employees to walk around office buildings
during breaks or to take a walk to communicate with fellow em-

 ployees instead of using the telephone or email. The practice and
policy of the workplace can be changed to incorporate periodic
breaks within the organisational schedule for short bouts of activ-
ity (e.g. of five to 15 minutes’ duration) in workplace settings or
for conducting walking or standing meetings (Commissaris 2007).
Meeting rooms can be equipped with sit-stand workstations so
that employees can choose to stand during meetings if they wish
(Atkinson 2014). These changes in workplace practice and policy
have the potential of providing an opportunity to a large number
of people, who mostly sit at work, to reduce their sitting time.
Workers can also be made aware of the need to change their sitting
behaviour by the provision of information, such as motivational
prompts to sit less at the workstation, via an e-health interven-
tion that encourages and reminds the worker to move from a sit-
ting position (Cooley 2013; Evans 2012; Pedersen 2013), or by
distributing leaflets with messages like “Sit less, move more” that
highlight the risks associated with sitting. An e-health intervention
consists of information that is delivered electronically like emails,
point of choice prompts or any message displayed on a computer
screen periodically. The same information can also be delivered by
a trained counsellor in an interactive manner when he or she listens
to workers, finds out their interests and offers them some choices
on how to reduce or replace their sitting behaviour (Opdenacker
2008).
There are also some drawbacks to these interventions. The perfor-
mance and productivity of workers at sitting jobs may be decreased
when walking at the workplace is encouraged and the employees
leave their desks. Workers on a treadmill desk need to be careful
not to trip or fall, and thus divide their attention between work and
safety, which might compromise their productivity (Tudor-Locke
2013). In addition, fine motor skills like mouse handling accu-
racy, mathsproblemsolvingskillsandperceivedworkperformance
decreases with treadmill and cycling workstations (Commissaris
2014; John 2009). This decrease in efficiency may be due to learn-
ing effects, that is becoming acquainted with new modes of work.
How the intervention might work
We envisage three different ways (in isolation or conjunction with
each other) that these interventions could work to decrease sitting
at workplaces.
Physical changes in the workplace design and
environment
If employees are using an ordinary desk or chair in the workplace,
provisionof newtypesof workdesksorchairscanmake themaware
of the possibilities these new facilities offer to decrease sitting, and
they may be tempted to try them. This would replace sitting with
some other activity, while allowing the usual tasks to be carried out
with the same efficiency. Changing the layout of the workplace by,
for example, placing printers away from desks forces employees to
stand up and walk to obtain their printouts.
A policy to change the organisation of work
Organisational policies should support social environments that
favour the formation of walking or exercise groups at the work-
place, or walking meetings. Formation of walking or exercise
groups, or a policy for walking meetings, will help individuals to
encourage each other to adapt to new behaviours. The provision of
purposive short breaks (with the aim of reducing sitting) will help
workers to engage in such activities more frequently. The breaks
would also encourage employees to take a walk to communicate
with colleagues instead of using the telephone or email. Standing
meeting rooms would provide an opportunity for every office em-
ployee to reduce his or her sitting time.
Provision of information or counselling
Since people are inclined to expend the least possible energy, work-
ers should be made aware of the need to decrease their sitting be-
haviour. They should be informed about health risks and the ben-
efits of reducing or replacing sitting with more active behaviour.
Wilks 2006 found that employees who had received information
regarding the health risks of sitting were more likely to use a sit-
stand desk more frequently than those who had not. Even if peo-
ple are aware of the adverse effects of sitting, and have access to
facilities and programs to decrease sitting, they will still find diffi-
culties in adapting to new behaviour. It requires conscious effort
for a person to interrupt their normal sitting behaviour and engage
briefly in physical activity of light to moderate intensity while at
work. To facilitate behaviour change, people may be provided with
point of choice prompts or counselling, which enable individuals
to evaluate behavioural choices. Prompts at points of decision can
be delivered through various means such as signs, emails, text mes-
sages, or telephone calls to create a new daily routine. A prompting
software can be installed in an employee’s personal computer so
that a one-minute reminder to take a break appears on their screen
every 30 minutes (Evans 2012).
Why it is important to do this review
Interventions to decrease sitting at work are increasingly popular,
however it is unclear whether they are effective in the long term
(Healy 2013). Therefore there is a need to evaluate whether sitting
at work can be reduced by interventions, and to compare the
effectiveness of various means of achieving reductions.
Although some studies show that sit-stand desks and walking have
been useful in reducing sitting, Straker 2013 found no significant
difference in the length of each episode of sitting. Also, Gilson
2009 did not find a significant effect of strategies to increase walk-
ing on sitting behaviour, while Evans 2012 found that point-of-
7

 choice prompting software along with education was superior to
education alone. So it is still unclear whether these interventions
actually work, and if one is better than the others for decreasing
sitting at work.
Possibly because of the variation in results across studies, recom-
mendations for reducing sitting at work vary. One recommen-
dation says prolonged sitting should be limited to no more than
two hours over an eight-hour workday (Commissaris 2007; ISO
11226:2000). Another recommends that a 30-minute period of
moderate intensity physical activity, or its equivalent, should be
incorporated into an eight-hour workday (Commissaris 2007),
and a third one recommends a five-minute exercise break, such as
walking, for every 40 to 50 minutes of sitting (CCOHS 2010). In
2015, an international group of experts recommended that desk
based employees should aim towards accumulating two hours per
day of standing and light activity (light walking) during work-
ing hours, eventually progressing to a total accumulation of four
hours per day. To achieve this, they recommended to break up
sitting time with standing work with the use of sit-stand desks, or
by taking short active standing breaks (Buckley 2015). While all
these guidelines stress the evidence of the adverse effects of sitting
on health, there is little evidence that different interventions that
aim to reduce sitting can achieve any of these recommendations.
Furthermore, since this topic is of increasing interest, it is likely
that the availability of evidence will increase in the near future.
A Cochrane systematic review will ensure timely updating of this
information for decision makers.

Criteria for considering studies for this review
Types of studies
We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster-RCTs
and also quasi-RCTs. Quasi-RCTs are trials that randomise par-
ticipants to the intervention or control group using a method of
randomisation that is not actually random, such as date of birth.
At workplaces, interventions operate at group level and are dif-
ficult to deliver to individuals (Ijaz 2014). Since it is more diffi-
cult to randomise units when the intervention is implemented at
a higher aggregate level, we also included controlled before-and-
after studies (CBAs) that used a concurrent control group for the
interventions that aimed to change workplace arrangements.
Types of participants
We included all studies conducted with participants who were 18
years or older, whose occupations involved spending the majority
of their working time sitting at a desk, such as in administrative
jobs, customer service, help-desk professionals, call-centre repre-
sentatives and receptionists (Pronk 2012).
We excluded studies that addressed transportation work. People
working in the transportation industry (such as taxi drivers, truck
drivers, bus drivers, airline pilots) and who operate heavy equip-
ment (such as crane operators, bulldozer operators) are also ex-
posed to prolonged sitting, but it is difficult to plan an interven-
tion to decrease sitting in such occupations. Reducing sitting in
people who work in the transportation industry and operate heavy
machinery requires different interventions that could be the scope
of another review.
Types of interventions
Intervention
Physical changes in workplace environment
• Changes in the layout of the workplace such as printers
situated further away from desks.
• Changes in desks enabling more activity, such as the use of
a sit-stand desk, a vertical workstation on a treadmill, desk cycle/

walking meetings, walking or other exercise groups during work
time.
• Breaks (periodic, frequent, or purposive) to sit less, stand up
and take an exercise break.
• Sitting diaries.
Information and counselling to encourage workers to sit less
• Signs or prompts at the workplace (e.g. posters) or at the
workstation (computer).

 Multiple category interventions
• Interventions composed of multiple elements that include
more than one of the above categories.
Comparison
We compared the interventions described above with no interven-
tion or with other active interventions.
Types of outcome measures
Primary outcomes
We included studies that evaluated sitting at work measured either
as:
• self-reported time spent seated at work by questionnaires; or
• objectively measured sitting by means of an accelerometer-
inclinometer, which assesses intensity of physical activity and
body posture (Kanoun 2009; Kim 2015); or
• self-reported or objectively measured time spent in episodes
of prolonged sitting at work (30 minutes or more) and number
of such episodes.
Secondary outcomes
• Estimated energy expenditure in MET hours per workday
as a proxy measure to detect changes in sitting time.
• Self-reported or objectively measured total time spent in
sitting at and outside work.
• Work productivity.
• Adverse events including any reported musculoskeletal
symptoms due to prolonged standing as a possible side effect of
using a sit-stand desk.
Search methods for identification of studies
Electronic searches
We searched for all eligible published and unpublished trials in
all languages. We were prepared to translate non-English language
abstracts for potential inclusion. Our search strategy was based on
concepts of types of study population, types of study design, work-
related aspects and outcomes related to sitting, and it consisted
of words generated with the help of a thesaurus such as ’seated
posture’.
We searched the following electronic databases from inception to
2 June 2015 for identifying potential studies:
• Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials
(CENTRAL; Appendix 1);
• MEDLINE (PubMed; Appendix 2);
• CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing & Allied Health
Literature; Appendix 3);
• OSH UPDATE (Occupational Safety and Health
Database; Appendix 4);
• EMBASE (embase.com; Appendix 5);
• PsycINFO (ProQuest; Appendix 6);
• ClinicalTrials.gov (http://clinicaltrials.gov/; Appendix 7);
and
• World Health Organization ( WHO) International Clinical
Trials Registry Platform ( ICTRP) search portal ( http://
apps.who.int/trialsearch/; Appendix 8).
Searching other resources
We checked reference lists of all included studies and systematic
reviews for additional references. We contacted experts in the field
and authors of included studies to identify additional unpublished
or ongoing studies.
Data collection and analysis
Selection of studies
Two review authors (NS, KKH) independently screened titles and
abstracts of studies that we found in our systematic search, to iden-
tify studies for inclusion. The same authors marked citations as ’re-
trieve’ (eligible or potentially eligible/unclear) or ’do not retrieve’.
We retrieved full-text study reports or publications for all citations
considered potentially relevant. Two review authors (NS, KKH)
independently assessed the full text of these to identify eligible
studies for inclusion. We recorded reasons for exclusion of ineli-
gible studies. We resolved disagreements through discussion or, if
required, we consulted a third author (SI). We identified and ex-
cluded duplicates and collated multiple reports of the same study
so that each study rather than each report was the unit of interest
in the review. We recorded the selection process in sufficient detail
to complete a Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) flow diagram (Moher 2009).
Data extraction and management
We used a piloted data collection form for study characteristics and
outcome data. We extracted the following study characteristics.
• Methods: study location, date of publication, type of study
design, study setting.
• Participants: number randomised, mean age or age range,
gender, inclusion and exclusion criteria of the trial, occupation,
number of withdrawals, similarity of study groups in age, gender,
occupation and sitting time at baseline.
• Interventions: description of intervention methods and
randomised groups, duration of active intervention, duration of

 follow-up, and description of comparisons interventions and co-
interventions.
• Outcomes: description of primary and secondary outcomes
and their assessment methods.
• Notes: funding for trial and notable conflicts of interest of
trial authors.
Two review authors (NS and either VH or SB) independently
extracted outcome data from included studies. We noted in the
’Characteristics of included studies’ table when trial authors did
not report outcome data in a usable way. We resolved disagree-
ments by consensus or by involving a third author (SI). One review
author (NS) transferred data into the Cochrane Collaboration’s
statistical software, Review Manager 2013 (RevMan). We double-
checked that we had entered the data correctly. For this purpose
we tabulated extracted information about studies in a spreadsheet
before entry into RevMan. A second review author (JV) spot-
checked a random 20% of extracted data for accuracy against the
trial report.
Assessment of risk of bias in included studies
Two review authors (NS and either SK or CN in the previous
version and VH or SB in this update) independently assessed risk
of bias for each study using the criteria outlined in the Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011).
We resolved disagreements by discussion or by involving another
author (SI). We assessed the included studies’ risk of bias according
to the following domains.
• Random sequence generation
• Allocation concealment
• Blinding of participants and personnel
• Blinding of outcome assessment
• Incomplete outcome data
• Selective outcome reporting
• Validity of outcome measure
• Baseline comparability/imbalance for age, gender and
occupation of study groups
We graded each potential source of bias as high, low or unclear and
provided a quote from the study report together with a justification
for our judgment in the ’Risk of bias’ tables. We summarised the
risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the
domains listed. We considered blinding separately for different
key outcomes where necessary (e.g. the risk of bias for objectively
measured sitting by means of an accelerometer-inclinometer may
be very different from a self-reported reduction in sitting time).
Where information on risk of bias relates to unpublished data or
correspondence with a trialist, we noted this in the ’Risk of bias’
tables.
We judged studies that used an accelerometer-inclinometer to as-
sess sitting as being at low risk, even if the outcome assessor was not
blinded, as participants were unlikely to misreport sitting time.
Conversely we judged studies assessing sitting time with self-re-
ported questionnaires as being at high risk of bias, as participants
receiving the intervention would have been aware of the goals set
and the purpose of the intervention, and there was potential for
misreporting sitting times.
We judged studies as being at low risk for selective outcome re-
porting if the final publications of the trial followed what had
been planned and registered in international databases (trial reg-
istries), e.g. ClinicalTrials.gov, ANZCTR.org.au (Australia and
New Zealand), or NTR (Netherland’s Trial Registry). We judged
those studies that were not registered in trial registries as being at
low risk for selective outcome reporting if they had reported all
the outcomes mentioned in the methods section.
We judged a study to be at low risk of bias overall when the study
reported a sufficiently detailed description of its random sequence
generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assess-
ment (only for studies that assessed sitting objectively by using an
accelerometer-inclinometer, but not for self-reported sitting time),
complete outcome data, no selective outcome reporting and valid
outcome measure, that is, all domains had a low risk of bias. Con-
versely we judged a study to have a high risk of bias when it re-
ported a feature that would be judged as having a high risk of bias
in any one of these eight domains. We did not assess blinding of
participants or personnel for risk of bias as it is not possible to
blind either in studies that are trying to modify activity behaviour.
Measures of treatment effect
We entered the outcome data for each study into the data tables
in RevMan to calculate the treatment effects. We used risk ratios
(RRs) for dichotomous outcomes and mean differences (MDs)
for continuous outcomes. Where only effect estimates and their
95% confidence intervals (CIs) or standard errors were reported
in studies, we entered these data into RevMan using the generic
inverse variance method. We ensured that higher scores for con-
tinuous outcomes had the same meaning for the particular out-
come, explained the direction to the reader and reported where
we reversed the directions, if this was necessary.
If in future updates of this review we include studies that report
results in such a way that we cannot enter them in RevMan in
either of the two ways outlined above, we will describe them in
the Characteristics of included studies tables, or we will enter the
data into Additional tables.
Unit of analysis issues
With studies that employed a cluster-randomised design and that
reported sufficient data to be included in the meta-analyses, but
did not make an allowance for the design effect, we planned to
calculate the design effect based on a fairly large assumed intra
cluster correlation coefficient of 0.10. We based this assumption
on a realistic estimate by analogy on studies about implementation
research (Campbell 2001). The three cluster-RCTs we included
10

 (Coffeng 2014; Puig-Ribera 2015; Verweij 2012) all accounted for
the clustering, so we did not need to adjust for the design effect. If
we need to do this in future updates of this review we will follow
the methods stated in the Section 16.3 of the Cochrane Handbook
for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for the calculations (Higgins
2011).
Where study authors reported multiple trial arms in a single trial,
we included only the relevant arms. In studies where two compar-
isons (e.g. educational classes compared to no intervention or to
educational classes plus software for point of choice prompting)
need to be combined in the same meta-analysis, we halved the
control group to avoid double-counting.
Dealing with missing data
None of the studies we included in this review had omitted re-
porting data.
When we did not find a full study report even after contacting au-
thors listed in an abstract, we categorised the references as Studies
awaiting classification.
We contacted researchers or study sponsors in order to verify key
study characteristics and obtain missing information or full text
reports.
If in future updates of this review we find numerical outcome data
missing, such as standard deviations (SDs) or correlation coeffi-
cients and we cannot obtain them from the authors, we will calcu-
late them from other available statistics such as P values according
to the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Where this is not possi-
ble, and the missing data are thought to introduce serious bias,
we will explore the impact of including such studies in the overall
assessment of results by a sensitivity analysis.
Assessment of heterogeneity
We assessed clinical homogeneity of the results of included studies
based on similarity of populations, interventions, outcomes and
follow-uptimes. We consideredpopulationsto be similarwhenthe
participants were 18 years or older and their occupations involved
sitting for a major part of their working time. We considered
interventions to be similar when their working mechanisms were
similar, for example, all interventions with changes in desks (see
Description of the intervention). We regarded follow-up times of
three months or less as short-term, between three months and one
year as medium-term and more than one year as long-term.
We used the I² statistic to measure heterogeneity among the trials
in each analysis. If we identified substantial heterogeneity we re-
ported it and explored possible causes by pre-specified subgroup
analysis. Moreover, we quantified the degree of heterogeneity us-
ing the I² statistic, where an I² value of 25% to 50% indicates a
low degree of heterogeneity, 50% to 75% a moderate degree of
heterogeneity and more than 75% a high degree of heterogeneity.
Assessment of reporting biases
Since we could not pool more than three studies for any single
outcome, we could not test for the effect of small studies using a
funnel plot or with Egger’s test (Egger 1997).
Data synthesis
We pooled data from studies we judged to be clinically homo-
geneous using RevMan (Review Manager 2013). Where studies
were statistically heterogeneous we used a random-effects model,
otherwise we used a fixed-effect model. When using the random-
effects model, we conducted a sensitivity check by using the fixed-
effect model to reveal differences in results.
We avoided decimals that are not meaningful with respect to the
original measurement while reporting the outcomes.
We analysed the effects of interventions according to the categories
of intervention defined above in Types of interventions: physical
changes in the workplace design and environment (changes in
desks; changes in chairs); policy to change the organisation of
work (supporting social environment and policies for breaks); or
information and counselling.
’Summary of findings’ table
We created a ’Summary of findings’ table using the outcome self-
reported time spent sitting, and objectively measured time spent
sitting by means of an accelerometer-inclinometer, at the work-
place measured in minutes per workday. We used the five Grading
of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
(GRADE) considerations (study limitations, consistency of effect,
imprecision, indirectness and publication bias) to assess the qual-
ity of the body of evidence as it relates to the studies that con-
tributed data to the meta-analyses for the pre-specified outcomes.
We used methods and recommendations described in the Section
11.5 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions (Higgins 2011). We justified all decisions to down- or up-
grade the quality of evidence using footnotes and we made com-
ments to aid readers’ understanding of the review where necessary.
Subgroup analysis and investigation of heterogeneity
We planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses using the
outcomesself-reportedtime spentsittingandobjectivelymeasured
time spent sitting by means of an accelerometer-inclinometer at
the workplace measured in minutes per workday.
• Age: as the probability of maintaining good health and
fitness diminishes as an individual gets older (AIHW 2008),
there may be differing motivations for participation in workplace
interventions depending on age and also because older
employees might expect a larger health benefit due to a reduction
in sitting (Manini 2015). We planned to compare studies
conducted in participants aged 18 to 40 years with studies where
all participants were aged 41 years or older.

 • Types of outcome measure used: we planned to carry out
subgroup analysis by type of outcome measure used i.e. self-
reported questionnaire, log book, accelerometer-inclinometer, or
ecological momentary assessment for each intervention.
We were unable to conduct subgroup analysis because we could
not find a sufficient number of suitable studies.
Sensitivity analysis
We planned to assess the robustness of our conclusions by exclud-
ing studies judged to have a high risk of bias from our meta-anal-
yses. However, there were not enough studies with a low risk of
bias to perform a meaningful sensitivity analysis.
Reaching conclusions
We based our conclusions only on the findings of our review. Our
implications for research suggest priorities for future research and
outline the uncertainties in this domain of research.

 Results of the search
We conducted searches in various electronic databases (CEN-
TRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, OSH UPDATE, EMBASE, and
PsycINFO, Clinical trials.gov and WHO search trial portal) and
we also searched for grey literature. We present a detailed search
strategy for all the electronic databases we used in the Appendices.
We identified 10713 references from the initial electronic litera-
ture search (run up to December 2013), retrieving 54 references
for full-text scrutiny. After further examination we excluded 46
articles and included eight studies in the first published version of
this review.
As outlined in Figure 1, the electronic searches yielded a total
of 1655 references for this update. These break down as follows:
CENTRAL 48 (Appendix 1, 2 June 2015): MEDLINE 608 (
Appendix 2, 2 June 2015): CINAHL 71 (Appendix 3, 2 June
2015): OSH UPDATE 4 (Appendix 4, 2 June 2015): EMBASE
763 (Appendix 5, 2 June 2015): PsycINFO 149 (Appendix 6,
2 June 2015): Clinical trials.gov 3 (Appendix 7, 2 June 2015):
WHO search trial portal 1 (Appendix 8, 2 June 2015). We also
identified seven references through checking reference lists and
update alerts by Google scholar for newly published articles on the
topic. Removal of duplicates reduced the total to 1272 references.
Based on the title and abstract, we selected 38 references for full
text reading. Out of these, we excluded those that did not fulfil
our inclusion criteria. When the article did not provide enough
data we contacted the authors for the missing information. If we
did not receive sufficient information to judge whether the study
shouldbe includedwe classifiedthe studyasawaitingclassification.
This resulted in 12 studies being included in this review update
in addition to the eight studies already included in the previous
version of this review.
Included studies
Study design
Eleven of the 20 included studies were randomised controlled tri-
als, two were cross-over randomised control trials, four were con-
trolled before-and-after studies with concurrent controls and three
were cluster-randomised trials. See Characteristics of included
studies for further details. Although the authors described their
studies as quasi-RCTs, we categorised Alkhajah 2012 and Neuhaus
2014a as controlled before-and-after studies, because the risk of
baseline differences for studies with only two clusters is very high.
For meta-analyses that included two arms of the same study, we
halved the number of participants in the control group in Coffeng
2014. To be able to do this we had to use the unadjusted results
at twelve months follow-up. In other comparisons we used the
adjusted values with the generic inverse variance method. One
included study (Neuhaus 2014a) reported only mean differences
and standard errors and the authors could not provide raw data,
so we could not adjust the number of participants. In this case we
modelled the means and standard deviations from the intervention
and the control group in RevMan as closely to the real data as
possible to achieve the same mean difference and standard error.
Then we halved the number of participants in the control group
and entered the resulting standard errors into RevMan.
Participants
In total, the included studies analysed 2180 employees. van
Berkel 2014 analysed 257 employees; Gilson 2009 179 employ-
ees; Verweij 2012 16 occupational physicians, and 523 employ-
ees; Alkhajah 2012 30 employees; Carr 2015; 44 employees; Chau
2014 42 employees; Coffeng 2014 412 employees; Donath 2015
31 employees; Dutta 2014 29 employees; Ellegast 2012 25 em-
ployees; Evans 2012 28 employees; Gao 2015 45 employees;
Graves 2015 44 employees; Healy 2013 36 employees; Pedersen
2013 34 employees; Neuhaus 2014a 44 employees; Gordon 2013
22 employees; Puig-Ribera 2015 264 employees; Schuna 2014 31
employees and Swartz 2014 60 employees.
Gender
Participants in nine studies were predominantly women (Carr
2015; Donath 2015; Dutta 2014; Evans 2012; Gao 2015; Gilson
2009; Graves 2015; Schuna 2014; Swartz 2014). In the remain-
ing 11 studies the proportions of women and men did not differ
significantly.
Country
Studieswere conductedinAustralia, USA andhigh income nations
in Europe.
Interventions
1. Physical changes in workplace environment
Nine studies evaluated the effectiveness of individual workspace
modifications on workplace sitting time (Alkhajah 2012; Carr
2015; Chau 2014; Dutta 2014; Gao 2015; Graves 2015; Healy
2013; Neuhaus 2014a; Schuna 2014).
Sit-stand desk
Seven studies assessed the effect of a sit-stand desk. The interven-
tion was assessed alone (Alkhajah 2012; Chau 2014; Dutta 2014;
Gao 2015; Graves 2015; Neuhaus 2014a), as well as in combi-
14

 nation with information and counselling (Healy 2013; Neuhaus
2014a).
Neuhaus 2014a also assessed the effectiveness of a sit-stand desk
plus information and counselling compared to a sit-stand desk
only.
Treadmill workstation
One study (Schuna 2014) assessed the effectiveness of a treadmill
workstation.
Cycle workstation
One study (Carr 2015) assessed the effectiveness of a cycle work-
station.
2. A policy to change the organisation of work
Two studies evaluated the effect of walking strategies (Gilson
2009; Puig-Ribera 2015). Gilson 2009 evaluated the effectiveness
of route and incidental walking on office employees’ sitting time
at work. The route-based walking was intended to increase brisk
sustained walking during work breaks. The incidental walking
targeted walking and talking to colleagues, rather than sending
emails or making telephone calls, and standing and walking in
meetings, instead of sitting at desks. Puig-Ribera 2015 evaluated
the effect of incidental movement and short (5-10 minutes) and
longer (10+ minute) walks on office employees’ sitting time at
work.
3. Information and counselling
Computer prompts
Three studiesevaluatedthe effectivenessof computerpromptsplus
information compared to information alone in decreasing sitting
time in office employees (Donath 2015; Evans 2012; Pedersen
2013). Computer prompts offer an opportunity to employees to
choose and engage in a short-burst of physical activity such as
standing or walking. One study (Swartz 2014) assessed the effect
of hourly prompts (computer based and wrist worn) to stand up
or to step on reducing sitting time in office employees.
Counselling
Verweij 2012 evaluated the effectiveness of counselling by occupa-
tional physicians compared to usual care in decreasing sitting time
in office employees. Occupational physicians are highly trained
specialists who provide health services to employees and employ-
ers (AFOEM 2014). Coffeng 2014 evaluated the effectiveness of
group motivational interviewing by occupational physicians on
office employees’ sitting time. Group motivational interviewing is
a counselling style that stimulates behavioral change by focusing
on exploring and resolving ambivalence in a group.
van Berkel 2014 evaluated the effectiveness of mindfulness train-
ing in decreasing sitting time in office employees. The mindful-
ness intervention consisted of homework exercises and informa-
tion through emails.
4. Multiple interventions
Two studies evaluated the effect of multiple interventions on sit-
ting at work (Coffeng 2014; Ellegast 2012).
Coffeng 2014 assessed the effect of multiple environmental inter-
ventions. The multiple environmental interventions consisted of
(1) the Vitality in Practice (VIP) Coffee Corner Zone - a work-
place coffee corner was modified by adding a bar with bar chairs,
a large plant and a giant wall poster (a poster visualizing a relaxing
environment, e.g. wood, water and mountains); (2) the VIP Open
Office Zone - an office was modified by introducing exercise balls
and curtains to divide desks in order to reduce background noise;
(3) the VIP Meeting Zone - conference rooms were modified by
placing a standing table and a giant wall poster; and (4) the VIP
Hall Zone - table tennis tables were placed and lounge chairs were
introduced in the hall for informal meetings. In addition, foot-
steps were placed on the floor in the entrance hall to promote stair
walking.
Ellegast 2012 assessed the effectiveness of multiple environment
interventions in combination with a walking strategy. The inter-
vention consisted of measures aiming to change working condi-
tions (e.g. sit-stand tables) and behaviour (e.g. pedometers as ac-
tivity feedback and face-to-face motivation for lunch walks and an
incentive system for bicycle commuting or sports activities).
Type of control group
No intervention
Fifteen of the included studies used a no intervention control
group (Alkhajah 2012; Chau 2014; Coffeng 2014; Dutta 2014;
Ellegast 2012; Gao 2015; Gilson 2009; Graves 2015; Healy 2013;
Neuhaus 2014a; Puig-Ribera 2015; Schuna 2014; van Berkel
2014; Verweij 2012).
Other controls
Neuhaus 2014a also compared sit-stand desks plus information
and counselling with sit-stand desks only resulting in the net ef-
fect of information and counselling. Carr 2015 compared a cy-
cle workstation in combination with information and counselling
with information and counselling only resulting in the net effect
of a cycle workstation.
Donath 2015, Evans 2012 and Pedersen 2013 compared point-of-
choice prompts plus information with information only resulting
in the net effect of point-of-choice prompts.
Gordon 2013 compared a cognitive-based e-newsletter with cog-
nitive-based health education.
Swartz 2014 compared computer-based and wrist-worn prompts
with instruction to stand versus instruction to step.
Outcome
Total time spent sitting at work
Sitting was reported as total time spent sitting at work in 14 studies
(Alkhajah 2012; Chau 2014; Donath 2015; Dutta 2014; Ellegast
15
Workplace interventions for reducing sitting at work (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 2012; Evans 2012; Gilson 2009; Gordon 2013; Graves 2015;
Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a; Pedersen 2013; Puig-Ribera 2015;
Schuna 2014). Carr 2015, Coffeng 2014, Gao 2015, Schuna
2014, Verweij 2012 and van Berkel 2014 reported sitting time at
work as occupational sedentary time which is equivalent to time
spent sitting at work.
Prolonged sitting episodes at work
Three studies reported time spent in prolonged sitting at work
(Evans 2012; Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a). Two studies reported
number of prolonged sitting events at work (Evans 2012, Swartz
2014).
Total time spent sitting at and outside work
Alkhajah 2012, Dutta 2014 and Verweij 2012 also reported total
time spent sitting.
Energy expenditure
Only one study reported estimated energy expenditure based on
information about sitting time at work (Pedersen 2013). They
chose 1.5 MET to represent sitting and 2.3 MET to represent
standing which is actually an unrealistically big difference. They
reported calories but this must be kilocalories. Júdice 2015b mea-
sured energy costs calorimetrically for sitting and standing and
found that there was only a 0.07 Kcal difference.
Work productivity
Three studies reported work performance on a scale of 1 to 10
(Alkhajah 2012; Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a). Carr 2015 also re-
ported having measured work productivity but the authors present
no data.
Two studies reported work engagement on a scale of 0 to 6
(Coffeng 2014; van Berkel 2014) using the Utrecht Work En-
gagement Scale (UWES). The Utrecht Work Engagement Scale is
a self-report questionnaire that measures three aspects of engage-
ment: vigour (6 items), dedication (5 items), and absorption (6
items).
Adverse events
Three studies reported musculoskeletal symptoms by anatomical
regions (Alkhajah 2012; Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a). Two stud-
ies (Gao 2015; Graves 2015) reported musculoskeletal discomfort
or pain at three sites: lower back, upper back, neck and shoulders.
Gao 2015 used a scale ranging from 1 (very comfortable) to 5
(very uncomfortable) and Graves 2015 used a scale ranging from 0
(no discomfort) to 10 (extremely uncomfortable). Carr 2015 also
reported having measured musculoskeletal discomfort but present
no data in their article.
One study reported more than one sick day for the last three
months (Alkhajah 2012), whereas two studies reported more than
one sick day in the last month of intervention (Healy 2013;
Neuhaus 2014a).
Onlyone studyreportedadverse eventsingeneral definedasoverall
body pain (Neuhaus 2014a).
Follow-up times
In three studies the longest follow-up was one month or less (Evans
2012; Healy 2013; Swartz 2014) and in ten studies the follow-
up was three months or less (Alkhajah 2012; Chau 2014; Donath
2015; Dutta 2014; Ellegast 2012; Gilson 2009; Gordon 2013;
Graves 2015; Neuhaus 2014a; Schuna 2014). We defined all of
these as short term follow-up.
The remaining five studies followed participants between three
to 12 months (Carr 2015; Coffeng 2014; Gao 2015; Pedersen
2013; Puig-Ribera 2015; van Berkel 2014; Verweij 2012) which
we defined as medium term follow-up.
No studies had a follow-up longer than 12 months which we
defined as long term follow-up.
Excluded studies
Of the 87papersassessedasfull text, we foundthat47 didnot meet
our inclusion criteria and that we summarily excluded. Twenty one
studies were not randomised controlled trials or controlled before-
and-after studies with concurrent controls. Three studies were not
conducted in workplace setting, three studies reported sedentary
time, which also included activities like standing and reclining.
10 studies reported sitting time but no distinction between sitting
at work and leisure time, and another 11 studies did not report
sitting time at all. See the Characteristics of excluded studies table
for further details.
Risk of bias in included studies
Risk of bias varied considerably across studies (Figure 2).

Risk of bias graph: review authors’ judgements about each risk of bias item presented as
percentages across all included studies
Allocation
Except Alkhajah 2012, Gao 2015, Healy 2013 and Neuhaus
2014a, all the studies described the method of randomisation
they had used, so we judged these studies to have a low risk of
bias for the domain of sequence generation. Donath 2015 used
the minimization method which is considered equivalent to ran-
domisation (Chapter 8; Assessing risk of bias in included stud-
ies. Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interven-
tions, Higgins 2011). Only Carr 2015, Ellegast 2012, Evans 2012,
Schuna 2014 and Swartz 2014 reported concealing intervention
versus control group allocation, so we judged all the other studies
to have a high risk of bias for the domain of allocation conceal-
ment.
Blinding
In all but a single included study (Verweij 2012), the blinding of
participants to the interventions they were receiving would have
been impossible due to the nature and aims of interventions being
self-evident, so we judged that these seven studies had a high risk of
biasinthe performance biasdomain. Verweij 2012 reportedasking
randomised occupational physicians not to reveal their allocation
to participating employees who were their patients.
For outcome assessment Alkhajah 2012, Carr 2015, Chau 2014,
Donath 2015, Dutta 2014, Ellegast 2012, Evans 2012, Gordon
2013, Healy 2013, Neuhaus 2014a, Schuna 2014 and Swartz
2014 used an accelerometer-inclinometer to assess sitting time,
so we judged these studies to have a low risk of detection bias.
Conversely Coffeng 2014,Gao 2015, Gilson 2009, Graves 2015,
Pedersen 2013, Puig-Ribera 2015, van Berkel 2014 and Verweij
2012 assessed sitting time with self-reported questionnaires or pa-
per-based diary or ecological momentary assessment, and so we
judged these studies to have a high risk of detection bias.
Incomplete outcome data
We judged Dutta 2014, Gao 2015, Gilson 2009, Neuhaus 2014a,
Puig-Ribera 2015, Swartz 2014, Verweij 2012 to have a high risk
of bias for incomplete outcome data. Dutta 2014 did not report
14% of working hours and the remaining studies lost more than
10% of participants to follow-up. We judged all other studies to
have a low risk of bias for incomplete outcome data. Gordon 2013,
Graves 2015 and van Berkel 2014 conducted intention-to-treat
analysis. Coffeng 2014 conducted multilevel analysis to account
for missing data. Chau 2014 reported that imputing values for
missing covariate values did not influence the effect of the inter-
vention on the adjusted estimates for the outcomes. Evans 2012
and Healy 2013 lost the same proportion of participants from
both intervention and control groups, so we believe that the miss-
ing data did not have a significant impact on outcomes (Cochrane
Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions, section 8.13.2,
Higgins 2011).
Selective reporting
We judged three studies (Evans 2012; Neuhaus 2014a; Schuna
2014) to have a high risk of bias due to discordance between out-
comes in available protocols and the ones reported in study results.
We judgedthe remaining17studiestohave alowriskof biasasthey

 the protocol or methods section for studies where a protocol was
not available (Alkhajah 2012; Chau 2014; Coffeng 2014; Donath
2015; Dutta 2014; Gao 2015; Gilson 2009; Gordon 2013; Healy
2013; Pedersen 2013; Puig-Ribera 2015; Schuna 2014; Swartz
2014; van Berkel 2014; Verweij 2012).
Other potential sources of bias
This domain had two parts as decided a priori:
• Validity of outcome measure
• Baseline comparability/imbalance for age, gender and
occupation of study groups
Coffeng 2014, Gao 2015, Pedersen 2013, Verweij 2012 and van
Berkel2014 assessed sitting time at work with questionnaires. Self-
report questionnaires are cost-effective and readily accessible to
the majority of the population however participants receiving the
intervention might be aware of the goals set and the purpose of the
intervention and may therefore misreport outcomes (Healy 2011).
The questionnaire used by Coffeng 2014, Gao 2015, Verweij2012
and van Berkel 2014 has not been tested for its validity in assessing
time spent sitting at work. Pedersen 2013 used the Occupational
Sedentary and Physical Activity Questionnaire (OSPAQ) which
hasmoderate validityforassessingtime spent sitting atwork(Chau
2012). Gilson 2009 and Puig-Ribera 2015 assessed sitting time
with paper-based diary (log book). There is a lack of validity and
reliability data for assessing sitting through logbooks. However,
they are less dependent on long-term recall and therefore might
provide a more accurate measurement of sitting time at work. In
any case log data are subject to reporting bias as it is not possible to
determine ifthe loghasbeenfilledinatthe requiredintervalsorifit
was, for example, completed on the final day (Clark 2009). Graves
2015 assessed sitting time at work with ecological momentary
assessment (EMA) diaries. Ecological momentary assessment is
a valid, reliable, and feasible approach to evaluate activity and
sedentary behavior. The benefit of EMA is its ability to collect data
in real-time and real-world circumstances hence there is no recall
bias (Marszalek 2014).
Alkhajah 2012, Carr 2015, Chau 2014, Donath 2015, Dutta
2014, Ellegast 2012, Evans 2012, Gordon 2013, Healy 2013,
Neuhaus 2014a, Schuna 2014 and Swartz 2014 assessed sitting
time at work with an accelerometer-inclinometer. Such objective
measurements also have some limitations such as outcomes be-
ing likely affected by methodological decisions made before and
after data collection (i.e. type of accelerometer, cut-off point and
non-wear time definitions) (Janssen 2015). Self-reported seden-
tary time has shown to have low to moderate correlation with ac-
celerometer-derived sedentary time, with improved validity when
specific domains of sedentary time are recalled (e.g. time spent
watching TV, computer use, sitting at work) (Healy 2011). We
therefore judged Coffeng 2014, Gao 2015, Verweij 2012 and van
Berkel 2014 to have a high risk of bias based on validity of out-
come measure.
We judged two studies to be at high risk of other bias: in Alkhajah
2012, participants in the intervention group were academics in-
volved with sedentary behaviour research, whereas participants in
the control group had never been involved in sedentary behaviour
or physical activity research. In Gordon 2013, the intervention
group had more official and managerial level individuals as well
as more people with significantly higher BMI in the intervention
group. We judged all other studies to have a low risk for other bias,
as neither baselines nor outcome validity was questionable.
Overall Risk of Bias
Overall, we judged all twenty included studies to have a high risk of
bias overall based on: inadequate randomisation (Alkhajah 2012;
Gao 2015; Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a), allocation concealment
(Alkhajah2012; Chau 2014; Dutta 2014; Gao2015; Graves2015;
Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a; Pedersen 2013; van Berkel 2014;
Verweij 2012), blinding of outcome assessment (Coffeng 2014;
Gao 2015; Gilson 2009; Graves2015; Pedersen2013; Puig-Ribera
2015; van Berkel 2014; Verweij 2012), incomplete outcome data
(Donath 2015; Dutta 2014; Gao 2015; Gilson 2009; Neuhaus
2014a; Puig-Ribera 2015; Swartz 2014; Verweij 2012), and selec-
tive reporting (Evans 2012; Neuhaus 2014a; Schuna 2014). See

item for each included study.

Multiple interventions for reducing sitting at work
Physical changes in the workplace environment
Sit-stand desks with or without counselling versus no
intervention: CBA
Outcome: sitting time at work
Measured as time spent in sitting at work: follow-up at three
months
One CBA involving employees in a public health research insti-
tute (Alkhajah 2012) showed a decrease in sitting of 137 minutes
per eight-hour workday (95% CI -179 to -95) in the sit-stand
desk group compared to no intervention. However, another other
CBA involved regular office workers and showed a much smaller
decrease in sitting of 33 minutes per eight-hour workday (95%
CI -84 to 17) with sit-stand desks (Neuhaus 2014a), which was
not significantly different from no intervention. Therefore, we did
not pool the results of these two studies comparing the effect of
a sit-stand desk alone versus no intervention due to substantial
heterogeneity (I² = 89%).
Two different studies also compared a sit-stand desk plus infor-
mation and counselling to no intervention (Healy 2013; Neuhaus
2014a). The pooled analysis showed that after three months the
sit-stand desk plus information and counselling intervention re-
duced sitting time at work by 113 minutes per eight-hour work-
day (95% CI -143 to -84; Analysis 1.1).
Measured as time spent in sitting at work: follow-up at six months
Also at medium-term follow-up (six months), in one CBA, (Gao
2015) providing workers with sit-stand desks reduced sitting time
at work with 56 minutes per eight-hour workday (95% CI -101
to -12) compared to no intervention (Analysis 1.2).
Measured as duration of sitting in episodes lasting 30 minutes
or more: follow-up at three months
Two studies containing three study arms measured the interven-
tion effect on duration of sitting in episodes lasting 30 minutes or
more (Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a).
Neuhaus 2014a compared a sit-stand desk only with a sit-stand
desk plus counselling and with no intervention. Healy 2013 com-
pared a sit-stand desk plus counselling with no intervention.The
pooled effect estimate of those three study arms showed a reduc-
tion of 52 minutes per eight-hour workday (95% CI -79 to -26)
in sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more in the intervention
group, with moderate heterogeneity (I² = 45%).
Analysis of the subgroup of sit-stand desks combined with coun-
selling resulted in a mean reduction of 63 minutes per eight-hour
workday (95% CI -93 to -33) with moderate heterogeneity (I² =
31%; Analysis 1.3).
Measured as total time spent in sitting at and outside work: follow-
up at three months
Alkhajah 2012 also reported a reduction of 78 minutes per 16-
hour day (95% CI -125 to -31) in total sitting time at work and
outside work with a sit-stand desk compared to no intervention
at three months’ follow-up (Analysis 1.4).
Outcome: adverse events
Overall body pain
In the Neuhaus 2014a CBA study one participant out of the 13 in
the sit-stand workstation group withdrew from the trial because
of overall body pain.
Musculoskeletal symptoms: follow-up at three months
Alkhajah 2012, Healy 2013 and Neuhaus 2014a reported mus-
culoskeletal symptoms by anatomic regions. We did not combine
their results in a meta-analysis because of substantial heterogeneity
in the results (I² = 98%). Musculoskeletal symptoms were mea-
sured as the percentage (number) of each group who answered
’yes’ to a question about musculoskeletal symptoms.
Alkhajah 2012 and Neuhaus 2014a found a decrease in percentage
of participants with musculoskeletal symptoms using a sit-stand

 desk compared to no intervention at three months. However the
magnitude of effect was much larger in the study by Neuhaus
2014a (MD -16.5, 95% CI -17.8 to -15.3) than in the study by
Alkhajah 2012 (MD -6, 95% CI -6.9 to -5.1).
Healy 2013 found a non-significant increase in percentage of par-
ticipants with musculoskeletal symptoms in the sit-stand desk plus
counselling group (MD 4, 95% CI 2.6 to 5.5) while Neuhaus
2014a found a slight decrease in percentage of participants with
musculoskeletal symptoms (MD -11.5, 95% CI -12.6 to -10.5)
in the sit-stand desk plus counselling group compared to no in-
tervention at three months’ follow-up.
Musculoskeletal symptoms: follow-up at six months
Gao 2015 assessed mean perceived musculoskeletal comfort for
different body parts (neck and shoulders, upper limbs, back and
lower limbs) rated at the end of a normal workday on a scale
from 1 (very comfortable) to 5 (very uncomfortable). The study
found no change in musculoskeletal symptoms with a sit-stand
desk compared to no intervention at six months’ follow-up (MD
-0.54 95% CI -0.89 to -0.19).
Outcome: work performance
Measured as: self-reported work performance: follow-up at
three months
In three studies (Alkhajah 2012; Healy 2013; Neuhaus 2014a) the
introduction of sit-stand desks did not lead to an increase work
performance (on a scale of 1 to 10; MD 0.35 score points; 95%
CI -0.1 to 0.8; Analysis 1.5). Work performance was assessed with
a 10 item scale ranging from 1 to 10 relating to the past week with
higher scores indicating better performance.
Measured as: more than one sick day in last three months;
follow-up at three months
One studyshowedasignificantincrease by120%inthe proportion
of employees having more than one sick day in the sit-stand desk
group compared to no intervention in the last three months after
installation of a sit-stand desk (RR 2.2, 95% CI 0.9 to 5.2; Analysis
1.6; Alkhajah 2012).
Twostudiesmeasuredthe proportionof people with more thanone
sick day in the last month at three months’ follow-up (Healy 2013;
Neuhaus 2014a). The introduction of sit-stand desks reduced the
risk of having had more than one sick day in the last month by
23% (RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 1.2). There was difference between
subgroups that had an intervention that included information and
counselling along with a sit-stand desk (reduction in risk by 30%,
RR 0.7, 95% CI 0.4 to 1.2) and those that had the sit-stand desk
only (reduction in risk by 10%, RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.4, 2.1; Analysis
1.7).
Sit-stand desks plus information and counselling versus sit-
stands desk only: CBA
Outcome: sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at three
months
Neuhaus 2014a found that providing information and counselling
to the employees along with the installation of a sit-stand desk was
more effective in reducing sitting at work (MD -56 minutes per
eight-hour workday, 95% CI -107 to -5) than just the installation
of a sit-stand desk (Analysis 2.1).
Measured as duration of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or
more: follow-up at three months
In the same study Neuhaus 2014a found a non-significant reduc-
tion in duration of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more
(MD -17 minutes per eight-hour workday, 95% CI -63 to 29)
with sit-stand desk plus information and counselling when com-
pared to sit-stand desk only (Analysis 2.2).
Outcome: adverse events
Measured as: self-reported work performance: follow-up at
three months
Neuhaus 2014a also found a non-significant reduction in work
performance score by 0.8 points (on a scale of 1 to 10; 95% CI -
2.1 to 0.5) with sit-stand desk plus information and counselling
when compared to sit-stand desk alone (Analysis 2.3).
Measured as more than one sick day in the last month: follow-
up at three months
In the same study Neuhaus 2014a found a non-significant increase
in the proportion of employees with more than one sick day in the
last month using the sit-stand desk plus information and coun-
selling compared to sit-stand desk alone, with a risk ratio of 1.1
(95% CI 0.6 to 2.2; Analysis 2.4).

 Sit-stand desks versus no intervention: RCT
Outcome: Sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work (cross-over RCT):
follow-up at short term
Two studies compared a sit-stand desk to no intervention (Chau
2014; Dutta 2014). The pooled analysis showed that the sit-stand
desk intervention reduced sitting time at work by 96 minutes per
eight-hour workday (95% CI -110 to -83; I² = 56%; Analysis 3.1).
However, the data from the Dutta 2014 study carried 84% of
the weight in the meta-analysis due to the unrealistically narrow
confidence interval of the outcome reported by the study. The
Dutta 2014 study reported percentage reduction in time spent
sitting at work, which we converted into minutes per eight-hour
workday.
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at eight
weeks
Inone RCT, Graves 2015 foundthatsit-standdesksreducedsitting
time at work by 80 minutes per eight-hour workday (95% CI -
129 to -31) at eight weeks’ follow-up (Analysis 3.2) .
Outcome: adverse events
Measured as musculoskeletal symptoms: follow-up at eight
weeks
Graves 2015 found no change in rating of musculoskeletal dis-
comfort by participants using a sit-stand desk compared to no in-
tervention at eight weeks’ follow-up (MD -0.51, 95% CI -1.03 to
0, Analysis 3.3). Participants rated musculoskeletal discomfort or
pain at three sites (lower back, upper back, neck and shoulders)
on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (no discomfort) to 10 (extremely
uncomfortable).
Treadmill desks plus counselling versus no intervention
Outcome: Sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at 12 weeks
In one RCT, Schuna 2014 found that a treadmill desk plus coun-
selling reduced sitting time at work by 29 minutes per eight-hour
workday (95% CI -55 to -2) compared to no intervention at 12
weeks’ follow-up (Analysis 4.1).
Pedalling workstations plus information and counselling
versus information and counselling only
Outcome: Sitting time
Measured as time spent in inactive sitting at work: follow-up
at 16 weeks
Carr 2015 found an non-significant decrease in inactive sitting at
work by 12 minutes (95% CI -24 to 1) with a pedalling worksta-
tion plus information and counselling compared to information
and counselling only at 16 weeks’ follow-up Analysis 5.1
Outcome: adverse events
Carr2015 foundnochange inmusculoskeletal discomfortoverthe
pastsevendaysandworkproductivitywith apedalling workstation
plus information and counselling compared to information and
counselling only at 16 weeks’ follow-up. However, the study did
not report any data for these outcomes.
A policy to change organisation of work
Walking strategies versus no intervention
Outcome: sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at 10 weeks
In a three-armed randomised controlled trial, Gilson 2009 found
a non-significant decrease in mean sitting time at work per day
(MD -16 minutes per day, 95% CI -54 to 23) in both route and
incidental walking groups compared to a control group (Analysis
6.1).
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at 21 weeks
In a cluster-randomised controlled trial, Puig-Ribera 2015 found
a non-significant decrease in mean sitting time at work per day
(MD -17 minutes per day, 95% Cl -65 to 32) following a web-
basedinterventionencouragingincidental walkingandshortwalks
during the working day compared to a control group at 21 weeks’
follow-up (Analysis 6.2).

 Information and counselling
Computer prompts plus information versus information
alone
Outcome: Sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at short
term
Two studies compared point of choice prompts plus information
to information only (Donath 2015; Evans 2012). Both the studies
were randomised controlled trials. The pooled analysis showed
that the point of choice prompt with information resulted in a
non-significant decrease of 17 minutes per workday in time spent
sitting at work (95% CI -48 to 14) compared to information alone
(Analysis 7.1).
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at 13 weeks
In another randomised controlled trial, Pedersen 2013 reported
a decrease in mean sitting time at work of 55 minutes per day
(95% CI -96 to -14) with computer prompting plus information
compared to information alone (Analysis 7.2).
Measured as number and duration of sitting episodes lasting
30 minutes or more: follow-up at 10 days
Evans 2012 also found a small decrease of 1.1 events per day
(95% CI -1.9 to -0.3) in the number of sitting episodes lasting
30 minutes or more with computer prompting plus information
compared to information alone (Analysis 7.3).
In the same randomised controlled trial, Evans 2012 also found
a reduction of 60 minutes per day in duration of sitting episodes
lasting 30 minutes or more (95% CI -107 to -13) in those using
computer prompts plus information compared to those given in-
formation alone (Analysis 7.4).
Outcome: energy expenditure at workplace
Estimated as calories: follow-up at 13 weeks
Pedersen 2013 estimated energy expenditure at the workplace
based on reported activities and found that the intervention com-
puter prompts plus information increased energy expenditure with
a non-significant 278 kilocalories per workday (95% CI -556 to
0.01) compared to information alone (Analysis 7.5).
Computer prompts to step versus computer prompts to
stand
Outcome: sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up six days
Swartz 2014 found that employees receiving computer prompts
to step sat 14 minutes per eight-hour workday more at work (95%
CI 10 to 19) compared to employees receiving computer prompts
to stand (Analysis 8.1).
Measured as number of sitting episodes lasting 30 minutes or more:
follow-up at 6 days
In the same study Swartz 2014 found that employees in the step
grouphad0.4eventsperdaymore sitting events lasting30 minutes
or more (95% CI 0.3 to 0.5) compared to employees in the stand
group (Analysis 8.2).
E-newsletters on workplace sitting versus e-newsletters on
health education
Outcome: sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up 10 weeks
In a randomised controlled trial, Gordon 2013 reported a non-
significant decrease in workplace sitting of six minutes per eight-
hour workday (95% Cl -70 to 59) following an e-newsletter on
workplace sitting compared to those receiving an e-newsletter on
health education (Analysis 9.1).
Counselling versus no intervention
Outcome: sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at medium
term
Two studies compared counselling to no intervention (Coffeng
2014; Verweij 2012). Both the studies were cluster-randomised
controlled trials. The pooled analysis showed that counselling re-
duced sitting time at work by 28 minutes per day (CI -52 to -5,
Analysis 10.1).
23
Workplace interventions for reducing sitting at work (Review)

 Measured as total time spent in sitting at and outside work:
follow-up at six months
Verweij 2012 also reported a non-significant decrease of 20 min-
utes per day (95% CI -85 to 45) in total sitting time with guide-
line-based counselling by an occupational physician compared to
usual care by an occupational physician (Analysis 10.2).
Outcome: adverse events
The Coffeng 2014 study reported no difference in work engage-
ment (0.1 score points; 95% CI -0.1 to 0.3; on a scale of 0 to 6)
at 12 months’ follow-up (Analysis 10.3).
Mindfulness training versus no intervention
Outcome: sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at six
months
Inarandomisedcontrolledtrial, van Berkel2014 foundthatmind-
fulness training did not reduce sitting time at work (MD -2 min-
utes per day 95% CI -22 to 18) compared to no intervention at
six-month follow-up (Analysis 12.1).
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at 12
months
In the same study, van Berkel2014 observed that the reduction was
still non-significant at 12 months’ follow-up (MD -16 minutes
per day, 95% CI -45 to 12; Analysis 11.2).
Outcome: adverse events
The van Berkel 2014 study reported no difference in work engage-
ment (on a scale of 0 to 6) at the six-month follow-up (0.1 score
points; 95% CI -0.2 to 0.4; Analysis 11.3), and at 12 months’
follow-up (0.2 score points; 95% CI -0.1 to 0.5; Analysis 11.4).
Work engagement was assessed using the Utrecht Work Engage-
ment Scale, which is a self-reported questionnaire that measures
three aspects of engagement: vigour, dedication and absorption.
Multiple category interventions
Multiple interventions versus no intervention
Outcome: Sitting time
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at 12 weeks
Ellegast 2012 found a significant decrease of 117 minutes per
eight-hour workday in workplace sitting (95% CI -168 to -67)
with multiple interventions compared to no intervention at 12
weeks’ follow-up(Analysis 12.3). The Ellegast2012 studyreported
percentage reduction in time spent sitting at work which we con-
verted into minutes per eight-hour workday.
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at six months
Coffeng 2014 found a significant decrease of 61 minutes per day
in workplace sitting (95% CI -115 to -7) with multiple environ-
mental interventions with or without counselling compared to no
intervention at six months’ follow-up (Analysis 12.1).
Measured as time spent sitting at work: follow-up at 12
months
Coffeng 2014 found a non-significant decrease of 48 minutes per
day in workplace sitting (95% CI -103 to 7) following multiple en-
vironmental interventions with or without counselling compared
to no intervention at 12 months’ follow-up (Analysis 12.2).
Outcome: adverse events
The Coffeng 2014 study reported no change in score points (95%
CI -0.14 to 0.14) in work engagement (on a scale of 0 to 6) with
multiple environmental interventions with or without counselling
compared to no intervention at 12 months’ follow-up (Analysis
12.4).

Summary of main results
We included 20 studies, two cross-over RCTs, 11 RCTs, three
cRCTsandfourCBAs, with atotal of 2174 participants.All studies
had been conducted in high income countries (Australia, USA,
and various European countries). Nine studies evaluated physical
workplace changes, two policy changes, seven information and
counselling and two multiple category interventions for decreasing
workplace sitting.
Physical workplace changes
Sit-stand desks
According to six studies, providing workers with sit-stand desks
alone reduces workplace sitting at short-term (three months’ fol-
low-up) from at least 33 minutes up to 137 minutes per eight-
hour workday compared to no intervention but the magnitude of
the effect is inconsistent and the quality of evidence is very low.
In two studies, providing workers with both sit-stand desks and
counselling reduced sitting during an eight-hour workday in the
same range (MD -113 minutes, 95% CI -143 to -84, very low
quality evidence) at short-term follow-up. In one study the reduc-
tion in sitting time was 56 minutes (95% CI -101 to -12, very low
quality evidence) at six months’ follow-up. In one study also total
sitting time at work and outside work decreased with sit-stand
desks compared to no intervention (MD -78 minutes, 95% CI -
125 to -31). Acording to two studies, sit-stand desks also reduced
the amount of time in episodes of prolonged sitting by 52 minutes
(95% CI -79 to -26). This is still less than the two to four hours
of standing promoted by a group of experts.
As to the secondary outcomes, none of the included studies mea-
sured energy expenditure with sit-stand desks. There was no ev-
idence of a significant increase in musculoskeletal symptoms in
four studies that evaluated sit-stand desks even though the mag-
nitude of the effect was variable and there was a decrease in some
studies. There was neither evidence of an increase or a decrease in
work productivity as a result of using sit-stand desks.
Active workstations
There was inconsistent evidence for active workstations. In one
study a cycle workstation did not have a considerable effect on
inactive sitting time at work at 16 weeks’ follow-up (MD -12
minutes, 95% CI -24 to 1, low quality evidence). In another study
a treadmill workstation led to a 28-minute reduction (95% CI -55
to -2, low quality evidence) in workplace sitting at three months’
follow-up.
Policies to change organisation of work
Two studies with 443 participants provided low quality evidence
that walking strategies did not have a considerable effect on work-
place sitting time at 10 weeks’ (MD -16 minutes, 95% CI -54 to
23) or 21 weeks’ (MD -17 minutes, 95% CI -58 to 25) follow-up
respectively.
Information and counselling
In two studies, counselling alone reduced sitting time at work by
28 minutes per day (CI -52 to -5, low quality evidence) at medium
term follow-up. Another study yielded low quality evidence that
mindfulness training did not change workplace sitting time sig-
nificantly at either the six-month (MD -2 minutes, 95% CI -22
to 18) or 12-month follow-up (MD -16 minutes, 95%CI -45 to
12). In the counselling studies, there was no considerable increase
in work engagement in two studies.
In one study, an e-newsletter on workplace sitting did not show
a considerable reduction in sitting time at work (MD -6 minutes
95% CI -70 to 59, low quality evidence) compared to those who
received an e-newsletter on health education.
Computer prompting plus information had no significant effect
on time spent sitting at work (MD -17 minutes, 95% CI -48 to
14, two studies) at short term follow-up. Another study showed
that computer prompting plus information significantly reduced
sitting time at work by 55 minutes per day (95% CI -96 to -14)
at 13 weeks’ follow-up. However the quality of evidence was low
for computer prompting plus information.
Yet another study reported that prompts to stand reduced sitting
time at work more than prompts to step (MD 14 minutes, 95%
CI 10 to 19).
Interventions from multiple categories
When interventions from multiple categories were combined to
reduce sitting, there was a significant reduction in sitting time
at 12 weeks’ (MD -117 minutes, 95% CI -168 to -67, very low
quality evidence) and six months’ (MD -61 minutes, 95% CI -
115 to -7, low quality evidence) follow-up in two studies but not
at 12 months’ follow-up in one study (MD -48 minutes, 95% CI
-103 to 8, low quality evidence).
Overall completeness and applicability of
evidence
In total we included 20 studies assessing various kind of interven-
tions for decreasing sitting at the workplace. Most studies assessed
sit-stand desks, and the results of our review largely concern them.
There were no RCTs or CBA studies that assessed the effects of
interventions such as periodic breaks or standing or walking meet-
ings to reduce sitting at work.
The included studies were all from Australia, Europe and USA.
We could not find any studies to include from other continents,
or from low- and middle-income countries. So it is difficult to
generalise the findings of this review beyond the settings in which
these interventions have been evaluated. This is partly because
38

 work environments and norms vary greatly across the globe, and
the acceptability and feasibility of workplace interventions per-
taining to sitting work may differ accordingly. Since obesity and
other lifestyle diseases are common in high income countries of the
west, most studies were from these regions. However since these
diseases are now becoming more prevalent in some regions of Asia
too (Tan 2011; Wang 2011), it is important that the effectiveness
of these interventions is tested on office employees also in these
regions.
Almost all studies had a very short to short term follow-up. There
were no studies with a long-term follow-up of more than one year.
It is important to demonstrate that behaviour change from sitting
to a more active behaviour is sustainable in the long-term. The
investment in sit-stand desks can be considerable but is much less
if the effects can be sustained in the long-term.
The population of participants in the included studies consisted
of office workers of a research institution, an academic institution,
a government agency, a police organisation and private organisa-
tions. We believe that the population is largely representative of
office workers who spend a large proportion of their working time
seated and who are in need of interventions to decrease sitting at
the workplace.
Although individually focused interventions such as sit-stand
workstations are very popular, they are considerably more expen-
sive than standard workstations, so their deployment may not be
feasible in many workplaces particularly in small offices or resource
constrained settings. Standing meetings can be an alternative low
cost option that provides an opportunity to every employee to
use these sit-stand workstations during meetings and so to reduce
their sitting time (Atkinson 2014). Posters or prompting to stand
up or engage in light to moderate intensity physical activity, or
placing printers or dust-bins away from desks could also be feasi-
ble lower cost interventions for larger populations of employees.
There is some evidence available for breaking up sitting time with
intermittent brief bouts of light-intensity or moderate-intensity
physical activity (Bailey 2015; Larsen 2014), but mainly from ex-
periments with obese and non obese adults. We still do not know
if this is applicable to workplaces, So there is a need for these low
cost interventions to be evaluated in future trials.
Interventions should also take advantage of changes in the built
and social environments, in the use of social networks, and the
promotion of relevant public policy changes. Traditional strategies
of behaviour change that require cognitive awareness might need
to be complemented with interventions that address automatic
habitual action (or inaction). Health messaging can play an im-
portant role when it matches the individual’s characteristics, em-
phasizing the benefits and target self-efficacy beliefs that encour-
age participation (Manini 2015).
Quality of the evidence
Most included studies were randomised controlled trials or clus-
ter-randomised trials but the risk of bias was high in most of these
and therefore the quality of evidence is low to very low. In an oc-
cupational health setting with complex interventions, the random
allocation and its concealment is known to be more difficult than
for a trial in a hospital setting. And yet three of the included stud-
ies managed to achieve it. Unless sample sizes are large enough,
the random allocation does not spread the confounders equally
across groups, and therefore randomisation is not very effective
in studies as small as those included in our review. Similarly the
self-evident nature of the intervention makes it difficult to blind
personnel and participants in these scenarios.
Risk of bias for objectively measured sitting time by inclinometer
differs from self-reported sitting time. It is not possible to misre-
port the outcomes when sitting time is measured by an accelerom-
eter coupled with an inclinometer, whereas with self-reported sit-
ting time, participants may be aware of the goals of intervention
and overestimate or underestimate the effect.
Alkhajah 2012 and Neuhaus 2014a were not RCTs as stated a
priori because they randomised only two groups. The trial authors
described them as quasi-RCTs. The risk of baseline differences is
much higher for such studies with only two clusters, so we believe
that it is fairer to categorise these studies as CBA studies rather
than RCTs. We addressed the baseline imbalances for both studies
in our risk of bias assessment.
Although studies performed poorly on the allocation concealment
and blinding of participants and personnel domains, most studies
assessed the outcomes in a way that we judged to have a low risk
of bias. Therefore, we rated the overall quality of the evidence as
very low to low.
Potential biases in the review process
We did not exclude articles published in languages other than
English. Therefore, we avoided language bias in our review.
We searched sources of grey literature and sought unpublished
studies and data to avoid publication bias. We had planned to
assess publication bias using funnel plots, but we found too few
studies per outcome. However, as most included studies were small
and all reported positive outcomes, it is conceivable that there may
be publication bias in this area. If more studies are included in
a future update, we will assess the extent of publication bias by
means of funnel plots and Egger’s test (Egger 1997).
Agreements and disagreements with other
studies or reviews
Recently, many systematic reviews have been published on
interventions for reducing sedentary behaviour (Chau 2010;
Commissaris 2015; Gardner 2015; Karakolis 2014; MacEwen
39
Workplace interventions for reducing sitting at work (Review)
Copyright © 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
 2015; Martin 2015; Neuhaus 2014b; Prince 2014; Tew 2015;
Torbeyns 2014; Tudor-Locke 2013 and VicHealth 2012).
Chau 2010 found studies that used e-health interventions, walk-
ing groups and educational counselling. The review included six
studies, but only one specifically measured sitting time at work,
which is our primary outcome, and concluded that there is a
dearth of evidence on the effectiveness of workplace interventions
for reducing sitting. Since Chau 2010 was published, the number
of studies that measured effects of interventions to reduce sitting
at work has increased. VicHealth 2012 included 13 studies that
reported various outcomes relating to workplace sitting, such as
number of breaks in sedentary time, musculoskeletal symptoms,
eye strain and work productivity, but no studies that measured
reduction in sitting time at work. Therefore, it is not possible to
compare our findings with this review. We performed a formal risk
of bias assessment of the included studies and incorporated these
assessments into the analysis and the conclusions we drew, whereas
Chau 2010 and VicHealth 2012 did neither. We consider this very
important, as the quality of the included studies is known to affect
the effect size. Risk of bias especially in the outcome assessment
domain was the major factor in drawing clear conclusions in this
Cochrane review.
Neuhaus 2014b (38 included studies), Torbeyns 2014 (30 in-
cluded studies) and Tew 2015 (five included studies) evaluated
the effectiveness of active workstations on sedentary time at
work. Neuhaus 2014b included laboratory based studies whereas
Torbeyns 2014 included studies that evaluated outcomes other
than sitting at work and both studies also included non-ran-
domised and uncontrolled studies. Neuhaus 2014b and Torbeyns
2014 concluded that installation of active workstations at offices
is a feasible means to reduce time spent sitting at work, whereas
Tew 2015 concluded that most studies conducted on height ad-
justable workstations had methodological shortcomings so high
quality randomised controlled trials are needed to help determine
the impact of height-adjustable workstation interventions on oc-
cupational sedentary behaviour, both in the short and long term.
In Neuhaus 2014b and Torbeyns 2014, even the non-randomised
studiesreceivedamoderate tohigh qualityscore which is not possi-
ble with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Overall, Tew 2015 and our
Cochrane review yielded findings that were considerably different
from the other two reviews. Martin 2015 (51 included studies)
and Prince 2014 (65 included studies) assessed the effectiveness of
interventions to reduce sedentary behaviour in adults at the work-
place as well as at other settings. Both reviews concluded that it
was possible to reduce sedentary behaviour in adults by interven-
tions that aim to reduce sedentary behaviour. A recent systematic
review by Commissaris 2015 (40 studies) assessed the effective-
ness of workplace interventions to change employees’ sedentary
behaviour or physical activity or both. This review found strong
evidence for a decrease in sedentary behaviour with the use of al-
ternative workstations and does not resemble our findings of very
low to low quality evidence for alternative workstations.
Another recent systematic review by Gardner 2015 (26 included
studies) looked into the behavior change strategies adopted by
sedentary behaviour interventions using the Behavior Change
Wheel. It found that using more techniques made the interven-
tions more promising in terms of an effect. The most frequently
observed behaviour change techniques were setting behavioural
goals, providing social support, and environmental interventions.
Gardner2015 foundtwoworkplace interventionstobe promising:
environmental intervention and education. Only the first finding
is in line with the finding of our Cochrane review. Karakolis 2014
concluded that sit-stand desks are effective in reducing perceived
discomfort and do not decrease productivity. Similarly MacEwen
2015 concluded that there is a substantial evidence gap on health
benefits of sit-stand desks and tread-mill desks and Tudor-Locke
2013 concluded that workstation alternatives have potential in
mitigating diminished energy expenditure in desk-based employ-
ees. However these three reviews did not evaluate reduction in
sitting time, which is our main outcome.
The differences in energy expenditure between sitting and stand-
ing are minor. Mansoubi 2015 found that sitting typing tasks
reached an energy expenditure of 1.45 MET (SD 0.32), whereas
standing only reached 1.59 MET (SD 0.37). On the other hand,
more active sitting tasks such as playing on the Wii reached 2.06
METS (SD 0.5). And walking MET values increased incremen-
tally with speed from 2.17 MET (SD 0.5) at 0.2 miles/hour to
3.22 (SD 0.69) at 1.6 miles/hour. It is also clear that using more
dynamic workstations increases energy costs considerably.For ex-
ample, using a desk bike type workstation at light intensity reaches
2.4 MET (Botter 2015). Mansoubi 2015 therefore questions if
the perceived positive benefits of reduced sedentary behavior are
primarily driven by increases in energy expenditure that accom-
pany the transition into light activity (e.g. playing on the Wii), or
to differences in postural allocation (e.g. standing), or a combi-
nation of both (e.g. walking and cycling). This should be further
investigated.
Aiming to reduce obesity or overweight by standing up at work
is not however realistic. Júdice 2015b found only a marginally
higher additional metabolic cost for standing. In theory if an av-
erage man and woman spent 50% of an eight-hour working day
standing, he would spend an additional 20 kcal and she would
spend an additional 12 kcal per working day. However, in this
Cochrane review, we calculated that after three months a sit-stand
desk combined with counselling reduced sitting time only by 113
minutes, so the additional energy expenditure is negligible. Also
Chaput 2015 mentions that greater occupational standing time is
not sufficient to prevent the development of overweight, obesity,
an impaired glucose tolerance or type 2 diabetes.
Katzmarzyk 2014 suggests that standing may not be a hazardous
form of behaviour. Given that mortality rates decline at higher lev-
els of standing, standing may be a healthier alternative to excessive
periods of sitting. However, promoting sustained standing is also
not the solution. Andersen 2007 reports musculoskeletal symp-

 toms with prolonged standing. Furthermore, Coenen 2015 men-
tions that an intervention with increased standing and reduced
sitting was less effective for people with low back pain. When
standing becomes a burden is not yet known, but promoting four
hours of standing per day during work hours could have nega-
tive consequences for specific groups. For instance, elderly workers
complain when performing standing work, even if it is less than
50% of their working time (Graf 2015).

Implications for practice
For changes in the physical environment, there was very low qual-
ity evidence that the use of sit-stand desks can reduce workplace
sitting time with about 30 minutes to two hours at short term
follow-up. This is considerably less than the two to four hours rec-
ommended by experts.There was no considerable effect on muscu-
loskeletal symptoms or on work performance neither in a harmful
nor in a beneficial way. There is no evidence on longer term effects.
It is unclear if standing can repair the harms of sitting because
there is hardly any extra energy expenditure. The effects of active
workstations were inconsistent: a treadmill workstation reduced
inactive sitting time but a cycle workstation did not.
For policies to change the organisation of work there were no
effects or they were inconsistent. Walking strategies had no effect
on workplace sitting, while computer prompting plus information
had an inconsistent effect on workplace sitting. There was low
quality evidence for a small reduction in workplace sitting with
counselling and no considerable effect of mindfulness training on
sitting time.
For interventions combining multiple approaches, there was in-
consistent effect on sitting time with a significant reduction at 12
weeks’ and six months’ follow-up but not at 12 months’ follow-
up.
Implications for research
For physical changes of the workplace, we need studies on sit-
stand desks with larger sample sizes and longer duration of follow-
up and studies on active workstations. To prevent contamination,
we recommend randomising employees in a cluster-randomised
design with at least two intervention sites and two control sites, but
preferably many more, to minimise confounding by workplace-
specific variables (EPOC). Even when employees are not explicitly
told which group they are in, true blinding is not possible, as
intervention activities will be noticeable at intervention work sites
(McEachan 2011).
We recommendconductingtrialsaimedatreducing sitting atwork
also in low and middle income nations where the burden of non-
communicable diseases is increasing slowly. All participants, irre-
spective of the nature of intervention, should receive information
regarding the adverse effects of prolonged sitting.
For policies to change the organisation of work, there is a need
to conduct trials on low cost interventions (standing meetings,
posters or prompts for standing, printers or dust-bins placed fur-
ther) for decreasing sitting, which would be very useful particularly
in small offices and resource scarce settings. It would be helpful to
first better understand the ideas that workers and employers have
about sitting and means to decrease sitting. This could help to de-
velop better interventions. There is qualitative research available
that should be summarised in a systematic review.
Future studies should measure the time spent sitting at work
by means of a thigh mounted accelerometer-inclinometer with a
data reduction approach that estimates inclination from triaxial
data. This is because the thigh is the segment of the body that
changes position when shifting from sitting to standing (Janssen
2015). We do not recommend the use of self-reported measures
alone, as the validity of these measures is unclear (Aadahl 2003;
Lagersted-Olsen 2014). Moreover, participants receiving the in-
tervention would be aware of the goals set and the intention of the
intervention, and would be therefore likely to underestimate or
overestimate sitting time when reporting it themselves (Rzewnicki
2003; Shephard 2003). Furthermore, if the intervention is found
to be effective at reducing sitting, future studies should try to
examine what replaced sitting time (i.e. standing, light intensity
physical activity, or moderate to vigorous intensity physical ac-
tivity). Reducing sitting time at work is important, but compen-
satory mechanisms outside work, for example more sitting dur-
ing leisure, might result in no net change in total sitting time
(Mansoubi 2015b). Hence, it is important that intervention stud-
ies also assess total sitting time at work and outside work. We rec-
ommend including outcome measures that will be of interest to
employers, such as valid and reliable measures of productivity, job
stress and absenteeism as well as cardio-metabolic health benefits.
Future studies should also include cost-effectiveness analyses to
help stakeholders and decision makers to determine whether the
cost of these interventions to reduce sitting at work is justified by
improvements in health and work-related outcomes.
The effect of the intervention could then be measured as the mean
difference in the time spent sitting at work in the intervention
group compared to the control group. The effect should be statis-
tically adjusted for the clustering effect. The overall sample size,
and also the number of clusters should be taken into account while
recruiting participants in order to calculate the statistical power
and the size of study groups.
The ongoing studies that we found studied sit-stand desks, tread-
mill desks, walking strategies, motivational prompts, information
and counselling. There are still no randomised trials set in ordinary
workplaces for other interventions such as sitting diaries, stepping

 devices, periodic breaks to interrupt sitting, or standing or walking
meetings.
Three ongoing studies have been designed according to our recom-
mendations (Dunstan 2014; NCT01996176, O’Connell 2015).
All three are cluster-randomised controlled trials and will have at
least two intervention and two control sites. Dunstan 2014 and
O’Connell 2015 have planned to assess the effectiveness of sit-
stand or height adjustable workstations while the NCT01996176
study will assess the effectiveness of an intervention consisting of
walking strategies, standing meetings and motivational prompts.
All three studies have planned to measure sitting at work with an
accelerometer-inclinometer.

well as written instructions on the cor-
rect ergonomic posture for both sitting and
standingandthe importance of regularpos-

Recruitment: Participants were recruited via an electronic advertisement on the com-
pany’s wellbeing website. The advertisement included a link to an online eligibility sur-
vey. Research staff contacted interested and eligible employees via telephone to schedule
a baseline testing session
Participants
Population: Healthy adults working in full-time sedentary jobs at a large private com-
pany were invited to participate via an electronic advertisement on the company’s well-
being website. They were physically inactive, overweight/obese
Intervention group: 27 participants

Methods
Random allocation with cross-over and wait-list control
Participants were allocated randomly by drawing from the ballot four at a time. The
first four were allocated to intervention group and next four to control group for four
weeks. The remaining participants were assigned to the wait-list control condition and
were placed on the waiting list in seven groups (four to five people per group). After the
initial four weeks, the previous control group received the intervention with the next
group from the ballot draw serving as their controls. This was repeated until all nine
groups had received the intervention
Unblinded
Study duration: 9 weeks
Drop out: 7%
Location: Australia
Recruitment: project was advertised to staff as part of their workplace wellness program
via internal mail, staff meetings and information fliers in the office. Staff members who
were interested in participating contacted the research team and received additional
project information and an expression of interest form. They could then join the study
ballot by returning the expression of interest form
Participants
Population: staff from a non-government health agency in New South Wales, Australia
Demographics:
Body mass index (kg/m²) : Underweight (<18.5): 13%, Normal range (18.5 - 24.9):
50%, Overweight (25 - 29.9): 25%, Obese (≥30): 13%
Interventions
Duration of intervention: 9 weeks
Intervention: sit-stand workstation
Control: no sit-stand workstation
Outcomes
Outcome name, measurement time/tool (units of measurement)
• Changes in self-reported and objectively assessed time spent sitting, standing and
walking/stepping (minutes/day) before and after the use of a sit-stand workstation
measured by ActivPALs and self-report questionnaires.
• Domain specific sitting (minutes/day) over the whole day, assessed by self-report.

• An explanatory meeting with team leaders
• Invitation to all employees from the department to participate in the study
• Data on sick leave, salary and the duration of employment was obtained through the
Human Resource Management department
Participants
Population description: office employees (18 years or above), working at the Dutch
financial service provider

Environmental modification 51 (SD 55.4); no intervention 65 (SD 61.3)
Interventions
Duration of intervention: Environmental modification: 12 months and GMI: 3.5
months
The Be Active & Relax program was evaluated using 4 arms:
• GMI (group motivational interviewing) and environmental modifications (3 clusters
92 employees);
Group Motivational Interviewing (GMI) derived from Motivational Interviewing (MI).
Motivational interviewing (MI) is a counselling style that stimulates behavioural change
by focusing on exploring and resolving ambivalence. A group setting has several benefits,
e.g. sharing experiences, providing feedback and giving support.
• Environmental modifications (3 clusters; 96 employees);
(1) the VIP Coffee Corner Zone - the coffee corner was modified by adding a bar with bar
chairs, a large plant and a giant wall poster (a poster visualizing a relaxing environment, e.
g. wood, water and mountains); (2) the VIP Open Office Zone - the office was modified
by introducing exercise balls and curtains to divide desks in order to reduce background
noise; (3) the VIP Meeting Zone - conference rooms were modified by placing a standing
table (a table that allows you to stand while working) and a giant wall poster (as before)
; and (4) the VIP Hall Zone - table tennis tables were placed and lounge chairs were
introduced in the hall for informal meetings. In addition, footsteps were placed on the
floor in the entrance hall to promote stair walking.
• GMI (7 cluster; 118 employees);
• No intervention or control group (6 cluster; 106 employees)
Outcomes

Three different models of desks were used: Workfit-S, a setup that attaches to the front of
one’s existing desk that can hold the computer monitor, keyboard and mouse; Workfit-
A, a setup that is identical to Workfit-S but attaches to the back of one’s existing desk;
and Workfit-D, a whole desk that is easily moved up and down. The Workfit-A and S
also came with an added work-surface and all three types of desks came with anti-fatigue
floor mats for comfort during standing
Control: no sit-stand desk

Participants
Population: administrative and academic staff working at six campuses in four Spanish
Universities in Galicia, the Basque Country and Catalonia
Intervention group: 135 participants (3 clusters)
Control group: 129 participants (3 clusters)
Interventions
Duration of intervention: 8 weeks
Intervention: Automated web-based intervention (W@WS) to encourage incidental
walking and short walks during the working day. The walking strategies focused on
breaking occupational sitting time by incidental walking into work tasks such as moving
rather than sitting during lectures and seminars, not sitting to take phone calls, short
walks (5-10 minutes) within University campuses, active transport (e.g. walking to work
whenever possible) or active lunch breaks
Control: no intervention

Intervention: the Mindful VIP intervention consists of 8 weeks of in-company mind-
fulness training with homework exercises, followed by 8 sessions of e-coaching. The
homework exercises comprised a variety of formal (“body scan” meditation, sitting med-
itation) and informal exercises (small exercises, such as breathing exercises when starting
up the computer, and grocery shopping mindfully). Additionally, free fruit and snack
vegetables were provided during the 6 months. In addition, lunch walking routes, and a
buddy-system were offered as supportive tools
Control: received information on existing lifestyle behaviour-related facilities that were
already available at the worksite

Following correspondence with the authors, they replied: “Ours is not a work place intervention
study, but a ’total sitting time’ community-based intervention study where the individual behavioural
intervention addresses all domains of life, i.e. leisure time, work, transportation etc. Approximately 1/3
of participants are not working (retired or unemployed) and those who do work, do not necessarily have
sedentary work, since our main inclusion criterion was minimum 3.5 hours of leisure time sitting/day.

Even though in the protocol we stated that in cases where we would include more than one comparison from a trial with multiple arms
in the same meta-analysis, we would halve the numbers of control group participants to prevent them from being included twice, this
does not work for the inverse variance input method. Neuhaus 2014a reported only the results from Ancova and could not provide
us with the raw data. For this trial we modelled the means and standard deviations from the intervention and the control group in
RevMan as closely to the real data as possible to achieve the same mean difference and standard error. Then we halved the number of
participants in the control group and entered the resulting standard errors into RevMan.
We judged studies to be at low risk for selective outcome reporting if the final publications of the trial reported what had been planned
and registered in international databases (trial registries), such as ClinicalTrials.gov, ANZCTR.org.au (Australia and New Zealand),
NTR (Netherland’s Trial Registry). We judged those studies that were not registered in trial registries as being at low risk for selective
outcome reporting if they reported all the outcomes mentioned in the methods section.
Initially we planned to pool interventions that were categorised under broad headings like physical changes in workplace environment,
policy changes and information and counselling, but later we found that the interventions were quite different from one another and
decided not to combine them under these broad headings. We also added a new category consisting of approaches that used multiple
categories of interventions at the same time.
