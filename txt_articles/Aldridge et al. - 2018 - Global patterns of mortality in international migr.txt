Summary
Background 258 million people reside outside their country of birth; however, to date no global systematic reviews or 
meta-analyses of mortality data for these international migrants have been done. We aimed to review and synthesise 
available mortality data on international migrants.
Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and 
Google Scholar databases for observational studies, systematic reviews, and randomised controlled trials published 
between Jan 1, 2001, and March 31, 2017, without language restrictions. We included studies reporting mortality 
outcomes for international migrants of any age residing outside their country of birth. Studies that recruited 
participants exclusively from intensive care or high dependency hospital units, with an existing health condition or 
status, or a particular health exposure were excluded. We also excluded studies limited to maternal or perinatal 
outcomes. We screened studies using systematic review software and extracted data from published reports. The 
main outcomes were all-cause and International Classification of Diseases, tenth revision (ICD-10) cause-specific 
standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and absolute mortality rates. We calculated summary estimates using random-
effects models. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017073608.
Findings Of the 12 480 articles identified by our search, 96 studies were eligible for inclusion. The studies were 
geographically diverse and included data from all global regions and for 92 countries. 5464 mortality estimates for 
more than 15·2 million migrants were included, of which 5327 (97%) were from high-income countries, 115 (2%) were 
from middle-income countries, and 22 (<1%) were from low-income countries. Few studies included mortality 
estimates for refugees (110 estimates), asylum seekers (144 estimates), or labour migrants (six estimates). The summary 
estimate of all-cause SMR for international migrants was lower than one when compared with the general population 
in destination countries (0·70 [95% CI 0·65–0·76]; I²=99·8%). All-cause SMR was lower in both male migrants 
(0·72 [0·63–0·81]; I²=99·8%) and female migrants (0·75 [0·67–0·84]; I²=99·8%) compared with the general 
population. A mortality advantage was evident for refugees (SMR 0·50 [0·46–0·54]; I²=89·8%), but not for asylum 
seekers (1·05 [0·89–1·24]; I²=54·4%), although limited data was available on these groups. SMRs for all causes of 
death were lower in migrants compared with the general populations in the destination country across all 13 ICD-10 
categories analysed, with the exception of infectious diseases and external causes. Heterogeneity was high across the 
majority of analyses. Point estimates of all-cause age-standardised mortality in migrants ranged from 420 to 874 per 
100 000 population.
Interpretation Our study showed that international migrants have a mortality advantage compared with general 
populations, and that this advantage persisted across the majority of ICD-10 disease categories. The mortality 
advantage identified will be representative of international migrants in high-income countries who are studying, 
working, or have joined family members in these countries. However, our results might not reflect the health 
outcomes of more marginalised groups in low-income and middle-income countries because little data were available 
for these groups, highlighting an important gap in existing research. Our results present an opportunity to reframe 
the public discourse on international migration and health in high-income countries.

Introduction
258 million people live outside their country of birth.1 
These international migrants account for more than 
3% of the world’s population and originate from diverse 
backgrounds with health determinants that vary 
considerably between the countries of origin and 
destination.
International migrants encompass a range of different 
subgroups including those who have chosen to migrate 
(eg, economic, student, and family reunion migrants), 
and those who might have been forced to migrate due 
to conflict, persecution, or environmental disasters (eg, 
refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants) 
who are often referred to as forced migrants.
Conflicting evidence exists about the health outcomes 
of international migrants. Some data2 support the healthy 
migrant hypothesis—an empirically observed mortality 
advantage among migrants from certain countries of 
origin, relative to the majority population in host 
countries2—whereas other research3,4 shows poorer 
Research in context
Evidence before this study
More than 258 million people live outside their country of birth, 
but little global evidence is available on the mortality of 
international migrants compared with general populations. In 
preparation for this analysis, we did a rapid review of PubMed 
and Google Scholar for studies on mortality in migrant 
populations. One large analysis of mortality data from 
six European countries highlighted inconsistencies in the 
patterns of mortality in migrants, and found variations in 
mortality across migrant populations whereby all-cause 
mortality was lower for migrants from east Asia and Latin 
America, and higher in those migrating from north Africa and 
eastern Europe compared with general populations. A 2003 
review found that all-cause and cause-specific mortality varied 
across international migrants by country of origin, destination, 
and migration trajectory. This review did not include a 
meta-analysis of available data, or present results across 
International Classification of Diseases-10 categories, and thus 
was limited in its ability to compare mortality among migrants 
and the general populations and by major disease categories.
Added value of this study
Our systematic review of the published literature provides a 
robust analysis of the available evidence base, suggesting that 
overall, mortality among international migrants was lower than 
the general population in high-income destination countries. 
Our results might not be generalisable to more marginalised 
migrants, and in particular forced migrants and those living in 
low-income and middle-income countries, as a result of the 
scarcity of data on their mortality outcomes. Therefore, caution 
is urged when generalising estimates to these populations and 
locations. International migrants had increased mortality due 
to infectious diseases (viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, and HIV) and 
external causes of deaths (assault and events of undetermined 
intent), and no mortality advantage was identified for asylum 
seekers, for whom limited data were available. Our systematic 
review and meta-analysis supports the healthy migrant 
hypothesis, and provides the most comprehensive synthesis of 
evidence to date on mortality outcomes in international 
migrants. Our results also indicate infectious disease and 
external causes of mortality as two key areas in which 
opportunities exist for prevention and ability to improve the 
health of migrants and the wider public. Our results also 
highlight the need to improve data collection in migrant groups 
such as refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented migrants, 
and migrants living in low-income and middle-income 
countries, who might be at increased risk of morbidity and 
mortality and were more likely to be underrepresented. 
Heterogeneity was high in our study and this could not be 
explained by subgroup analyses. This heterogeneity indicates 
that some groups of migrants will continue to have unmet 
health needs and the summary mortality advantage presented 
must not be used as a justification for any restrictions in access 
to health care for migrant groups, which is a growing issue 
across many countries.
Implications of all the available evidence
Public perception that migrants place an undue burden on 
societies is guiding governments across the globe to tighten 
access to health care and generate so-called hostile 
environments for these groups. Our findings contradict claims 
that migrants are a health burden in high-income countries and 
suggest that these policies do not align with the available 
evidence. Our results show that current perceptions 
underestimate the positive contributions of migrants to host 
societies in these settings. Migrants have a mortality advantage 
compared with general populations across the majority of 
disease categories, with the exception of infectious diseases and 
external causes. Improving access to health services and treating 
infectious diseases in specific migrant subpopulations is likely to 
have multiple benefits: lowering mortality rates, strengthening 
global health security and effective infection prevention and 
control, and reducing the burden of diseases such as hepatitis, 
tuberculosis, and HIV in destination countries. This will require 
host health services to better adapt to increase their accessibility 
and responsiveness to the needs of some migrant groups. Risk 
of mortality from infectious disease varies greatly among 
migrants and therefore screening should be context and 
epidemiology specific, codeveloped with migrants, and only 
done in areas where a health benefit to migrants can be 
demonstrated. Future research should seek to address the 
scarcity of data specific to migrant subgroups who are 
marginalised, in particular forced migrants and those originating 
from and living in low-income and middle-income countries. 
These groups might have a higher mortality burden and further 
research into these populations should be prioritised.

outcomes in certain disease categories and key migrant 
groups. Although a mortality advantage in international 
migrants has been supported by several studies,5–8 
evidence9 from six European countries suggested that 
mortality patterns vary by birthplace, with migrants from 
east Asia and Latin America having lower all-cause 
mortality and those from Eastern Europe and Africa 
having higher mortality than the general populations of 
host countries. Contradictory evidence exists about 
certain migrant subgroups such as refugees with studies 
showing both improved,10,11 no difference12 and worsened13 
mortality outcomes across a diversity of countries and 
refugee settings.
Our study aimed to systematically identify and 
synthesise original research to investigate global 
patterns of mortality in international migrants. First, we 
aimed to investigate the relative and absolute mortality 
(all-cause mortality and International Classification of 
Diseases, tenth revision [ICD-10] classified cause-
specific mortality) in international migrants compared 
with the general population. Second, we aimed to 
examine differences in all-cause and ICD-10 classified 
cause-specific mortality by sex, migrant subgroup 
(eg, refugee, asylum seeker, student, economic migrant) 
and region of origin. Third, we aimed to assess how 
representative the research evidence base was with 
regard to the mortality of migrants by investigating 
whether an association exists between cause-specific 
risk of mortality and the number of studies done by 
cause-specific ICD-10 disease category.
Methods
Search strategy and selection criteria
For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we 
searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and 
Google Scholar databases for studies published between 
Jan 1, 2001, and March 31, 2017, reporting mortality in 
international migrants, without language restrictions. 
Full search terms are provided in the appendix. We chose 
to search for studies published after Jan 1, 2001, because 
a previous systematic review of mortality in migrants had 
been published by this date, but it did not contain a meta-
analysis and did not assess outcomes across all ICD-10 
categories.3
On Sept 3, 2018, we updated our search using the same 
databases, search terms, and inclusion criteria.
We included observational (cohort and cross-sectional), 
systematic reviews, and randomised controlled trials 
reporting quantitative data on mortality in international 
migrants of any age residing outside their country of 
birth.
We excluded studies that recruited participants 
exclusively from intensive care or high dependency 
hospital units, with an existing health condition or status 
(eg, myocardial infarction, HIV, tuberculosis, pregnancy), 
or a particular health exposure (eg, smoking, high blood 
pressure). We also excluded studies limited to maternal or 
perinatal outcomes. The study with the largest or most 
representative sample was included, and when these were 
equal, the most recent study was included. Discrepancies 
in the inclusion or exclusion of papers during screening 
were discussed until consensus was achieved, and 
RWA resolved any final discrepancies. This study was 
done in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items 
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)14 
guidelines. The study protocol is available online. 
Deviations from the protocol are reported in the appendix.
Data analysis
Five reviewers (RWA, SB, ALB, LBN, and PP) screened 
titles, abstracts, and full texts using Covidence 
systematic review software. Two reviewers independently 
examined citations at each stage. We adapted a 
previously used data extraction form,15 to record study 
design, year or years of study, country, country of origin, 
number of participants, standardised mortality ratios 
(SMRs), absolute mortality rates, and summary 
descriptions of the study population. Extracted data 
were reviewed and checked by a second author before 
cleaning and analysis. Duplicate data were removed for 
studies reporting information from the same migrant 
group (by country of destination) for the same mortality 
outcome and time period.
Outcomes of interest were all-cause and ICD-10 cause-
specific SMRs and absolute mortality rates. The number 
of datapoints that presented cause-specific mortality 
according to ICD-10 groups was also calculated. We report 
data by ICD-10 disease category, and converted outcomes 
from studies reporting data using older ICD versions as 
necessary.

assessment form adapted from the Newcastle Ottawa 
Scale.16 A randomly selected sample (10%) of these 
assessments was corroborated by LBN.
We used the metafor package (version 2.0) in the 
statistical software R (version 3.5.1) and random-effects 
models to calculate pooled estimates of mortality and 
cor 
responding 95% CIs. Heterogeneity was assessed 
using the I² statistic, and assessed further in subgroup 
analyses wherever possible. Mortality point estimates 
were included in each model with corresponding SEs 
extracted directly or calculated using CIs for each point 
estimate.
Subgroup analyses were done when appropriate to as-
sess mortality by sex, migrant type (eg, refugee or asylum 
seeker), World Bank geographical region of origin, World 
Bank income level of countries of origin, and evidence 
quality. The study is registered with PROSPERO, number 
CRD42017073608.

for all-cause mortality
Studies are presented as 
region of origin, country of 
study (study [year]). Data are 
presented for male 
individuals (A) and female 
individuals (B). 13 studies 
reported all-cause mortality 
estimates, of which 
53 estimates were available for 
men, and 50 were available for 
women. SMR=standardised 
mortality ratio.

for eligibility (eight studies could not be located), of 
which 106 met the inclusion criteria and 6283 datapoints 
were extracted. After the removal of duplicate data, 
96 studies and 5464 mortality estimates for more than 
15·2 million migrants were included in our analyses. 
References for all included studies are listed in the 
appendix. These mortality estimates included 110 esti-
mates for refugees, 144 estimates for asylum seekers, and 
six estimates for labour migrants. Migrant subgroup 
could not be determined for 5204 mortality estimates 
from 88 included studies, with reporting generally 
referring to these groups as foreign-born rather than 
specific migrant groups (eg, students or labour migrants).
We identified World Bank geographical region of origin 
for 4085 (75%) of 5464 mortality estimates, and country of 
origin for 1720 (31%) of 5464 estimates. International 
migrants originated from 92 countries and 25 migrant 
destination countries were included (appendix). Data 
from the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs1 
indicate that in 2017, 165 (64%) of 258 million international 
migrants lived in high-income countries, with 81 (31%) of 
258 million residing in middle-income countries and 
11 (5%) of 258 million residing in low-income countries. 
Of 5464 mortality estimates, 5327 (97%) estimates were 
from high-income countries, 115 (2%) were from middle-
income countries, and 22 (<1%) were from low-income 
countries.
Our all-cause SMR meta-analyses included data from 
16 studies4,17–31 and 119 mortality estimates (table). 
Seven studies17,19,20,23–25 were done using national census 
data, and therefore included all international migrants 
reported in these countries. 89 (75%) of 119 included 
SMR all-cause mortality estimates were less than 1, 
indicating a migrant mortality advantage. Summary 
estimates of all-cause SMRs for international migrants 
were less than 1 when compared with the general 
pop 
ulation of the host country (0·70 [95% CI 0·65–0·76]; 
I²=99·8%; appendix). All-cause SMRs remained less 
than 1 when analysed by sex (0·72, 0·63–0·81; I²=99·8%] 
for men; 0·75 [0·67–0·84]; I²=99·8% for women; 
figure 2). Of the 16 studies included in the all-cause meta-
analyses, all were done in high-income settings with the 
exception of one study18 from Brazil.
We assessed all-cause mortality by migrant subgroup, 
including data on refugees (16 mortality estimates) 
and asylum seekers (four mortality estimates), and 
99 estimates for which migrant subgroup was 
unspecified. Consistent with the findings for all inter-
national migrants, refugees had lower SMRs than the 
general 
population 
(0·50 
[0·46–0·54]; 
I²=89·8%; 
figure 3). These all-cause mortality estimates were

obtained from two studies19,20 done in Canada and 
included refugees originating from multiple geo-
graphical regions of origin. We found no evidence of a 
mortality advantage for asylum seekers (1·05 [0·89–1·24]; 
I²=54·4%), but limited data were available for this group, 
and only four datapoints from two separate studies done 
in the Netherlands on migrants from multiple geo-
graphical regions of origin.4,26
We did a subgroup meta-analysis on all-cause 
mortality by geographical region of origin and 
destination (appendix). Summary SMRs for all World 
Bank regions were less than 1; however, weak statistical 
evidence indicated a lower mortality in international 
migrants from sub-Saharan Africa (0·81 [0·59–1·10]; 
I²=99·3%) and the Middle East and north Africa 
(0·98 [0·95–1·01]; I²=99·3%). We did a post-hoc analysis 
of all-cause SMRs by World Bank income group in 
migrant origin countries, investigating a possible 
association between income at origin and SMRs in the 
destination country. We only found evidence of reduced 
mortality in migrants from upper-middle-income 
countries (0·65 [0·61–0·70]; I²=0·0%; appendix). Many 
studies only presented results by geographical region of 
origin and not country, and therefore this analysis only 
included 22 datapoints from six high-income countries, 
five datapoints from two upper middle-income 
countries, and 12 datapoints from three lower-middle-
income countries.
We included 1175 SMR estimates in our meta-analyses 
by ICD-10 disease category. Of 13 ICD-10 categories, 
migrants had a mortality advantage across eight 
categories (circulatory, digestive, endocrine, injuries, 
mental and behavioural, neoplasms, nervous, and 
respiratory) compared with the general population in 
destination countries (figure 4). No differences in 
mor 
tality were identified for three disease categories 
(blood, genito 
urinary, and musculoskeletal), and mig-
rant mortality was increased for infectious diseases 
(2·4 [1·8–3·2]; I²=98·5%) and external causes of 
mortality (1·3 [1·1–1·5]; I²=98·3%) compared with the 
general population.
We did further subgroup analyses, not specified in our 
protocol, for the six ICD-10 categories with the highest 
total number of SMR estimates (figure 5). These 
analyses showed improved or no mortality difference 
across the majority of subgroups with several important 
exceptions. Events of undetermined intent were 
increased in international migrants (8·8 [5·5–14·1]; 
I²=0·0%) compared with the general population in host 
countries, which combined eight point estimates from 
one study in international migrants in Germany.29 There 
was evidence of increased SMRs for assault (2·7 
[1·9–3·7]; I²=90·3%) among migrants, which combined 
17 point estimates from five separate studies done in the 
USA,22 Sweden,30 the Netherlands,4,26 and Greece.17 We 
also found evidence of increased SMRs for viral hepatitis 
among migrants (2·9 [1·6–5·1]; I²=96·7%) from eight 
estimates in two separate studies in Germany24 and 
Israel,24 and the Netherlands.26 Mortality for tuberculosis 
was increased for migrants (6·0 [3·0–11·7]; I²=57·6%) 
in three studies in the Netherlands,26 Greece,17 and 
Sweden.32 Mortality was increased for HIV (3·6 [1·4–9·7]; 
I²=98·9%) in four studies in migrants from multiple 
regions and living in Canada,19 the USA,22 and the 
Netherlands.4,26
We included 3964 absolute mortality estimates, with 
1836 age-standardised, 580 age-adjusted, and 452 age-
adjusted and sex-adjusted or standardised estimates. 
All-cause age-standardised mortality in migrants (of 
all ages) ranged from 420 per 100 000 population 
in Nicaraguan migrants living in Costa Rica,33 to 874 in 
male migrants from the former Soviet Union living 
in Israel.25
We did several analyses to examine the balance of 
the evidence (ie, the proportion of datapoints that 
represented each migrant type) identified by the review. 
In a pre-planned analysis, we examined the association 
between the number of mortality estimates and 
summary SMR estimates for each ICD-10 category 
(appendix). Two ICD-10 disease categories had SMR 
estimates higher than 1, suggesting migrants had 
higher mortality than the general population: infectious 
diseases (164 mortality estimates) and external causes 
of mortality (591). However, the highest total number 
of estimates were available for neoplasms (n=1643), 
diseases of the circulatory system (n=969), and external 
causes of mortality (n=591). Due to the quantity of 
included data, we also did several post-hoc analyses 
by geographical region of origin and destination 
(appendix). Migrants from the Middle East, north 
Africa, and North America were underrep 
resented.

Migrants to the Middle East and north Africa, sub-
Saharan Africa, south Asia, Latin America, and the 
Caribbean were all underrepresented. The number of 
mortality estimates was inconsistent across migrant 
sub 
groups, with labour migrants and forced migrants 
(including refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented 
migrants) all underrepresented.
High heterogeneity was identified across studies. We 
investigated this heterogeneity using several pre-specified 
analyses, including by sex, migrant subgroup, region of 
origin, and ICD-10 diagnosis and in a post-hoc analysis by 
ICD-10 subgroup. Although heterogeneity remained high 
when stratifying by sex or ICD-10 disease category, it was 
reduced for some analyses when stratified by migrant 
groups and ICD-10 subgroup.
We examined the quality of included studies using an 
adapted version of the Newcastle Ottawa Scale, and 
found that included studies were of high quality with a 
median score of 89% out of a maximum of 100% 
(appendix). Only six studies scored less than 50% and 
therefore we decided not to do our pre-planned quality 
subgroup meta-analyses. A post-hoc assessment found 
some evidence for risk of publication bias (appendix) 
with possible underpublication of results showing lower 
mortality in migrants.
Discussion
We found substantial evidence of a mortality advantage in 
international migrants relative to the general population, 
with most studies done in high-income countries. This 
mortality advantage was observed across geographical 
region of origin and the majority of ICD-10 categories, 
with the exception of infectious diseases and external 
causes, in which migrants had increased mortality 
compared with the general population in destination 
countries. Infectious disease mortality was increased for 
viral hepatitis, tuberculosis, and HIV. Assaults and deaths 
of undetermined intent were increased among migrants 
for external causes of mortality.
Our results were obtained for international migrants 
(often reported as foreign-born) in high-income settings 
and populations reported as foreign born. Data on 
international migration34,35 suggest that of the 258 million 
international migrants worldwide, 150 million are migrant 
workers and 5 million are students. Our results are 
therefore more likely to better reflect outcomes in these 
groups than other migrant groups. Since the mortality 
estimates used for our meta-analyses were rarely reported 
according to migrant subgroup, caution must be taken 
when generalising these estimates to refugees, asylum 
seekers, and undocumented migrants, particularly those 
living in low-income and middle-income countries. These 
individuals might be at increased risk of mortality, and 
were underrepresented in research and routine mortality 
data and thus in our meta-analysis of SMRs. In contrast to 
many other subgroups of international migrants, a large 
proportion of refugees move between low-income and 
middle-income countries, representing an important gap 
in the existing published literature.
The aggregation of available data on mortality in 
migrant populations is crucial for comprehensively and 
rigorously summarising the knowledge base, providing 
insight with regard to the association between migration 
and mortality to inform health services, and countering 
discriminatory or hostile policies.36,37 Contrary to the 
negative representation of migrants in the media as a 
burden to health systems,38 our research provides 
substantial evidence in support of the mortality advantage 
of migrants compared with the general population in 
high-income countries. These results therefore challenge 
misconceptions and policies that do injustice to migrants, 
representing them as a risk and burden to health systems 
and society, and instead highlight positive contributions 
of migration in these countries.
Previous research3,39 has identified several factors that 
might contribute to improved health outcomes in 
migrants compared with host populations, and non-
migrating peers in countries of origin. Data supporting 
a healthy migrant hypothesis suggest that healthier 
migrants might be more likely to choose to migrate, 
benefit from decisions to migrate, or successfully 
migrate, and that health is thus a predictor of 
migration.40,41 The mortality advantage of migrants 
might also be attributed to the so-called salmon bias, 
whereby migrants return to their countries of origin 
prior to death.42,43 Selective return migration might also 
occur among migrants who have health or integration 
challenges, and return to their countries of origin, 
supporting 
the 
so-called 
unhealthy 
remigration 
hypothesis.39 However, evidence also suggests that these 
factors do not entirely explain the mortality advantages, 
and that other social and cultural mechanisms44 are 
likely to be driving these patterns.42 Overestimation of 
migrant denominator pop 
ulations could lead to con-
siderable underestimation of mortality rates, particularly 
in census or registry-based studies that do not remove 
migrants after they leave a country. A Swedish study45 
found that accounting for the inflated denominator 
reduced, but did not eliminate the mortality advantage. 
Other detailed studies from the UK46 and Germany6 
found that correcting for denominator inflation also did 
not explain the reduced migrant mortality. A further 
possible alternative explanation for our findings is 
residual confounding by age in the analysis of SMRs 
because the average age of migrants is usually younger 
than that of host populations. However, we feel that this 
explanation is unlikely for several reasons. First, the 
mortality advantage was observed in studies that 
compared young migrants with young non-migrants in 
the host country.22,27 Second, although the mortality 
advantage declines with age, it was observed across age 
categories.46,47 Third, using similar methods to this 
review, we previously found evidence of severely 
increased SMRs in young marginalised pop 
ulations

including people who have experienced home 
lessness, 
substance use, and impris 
onment.15
However, our study has several limitations. We 
included studies done in Ethiopia, Guinea, Tanzania, 
Kenya, Pakistan, and Costa Rica in our review, but Brazil 
was the only non-high-income country for which migrant 
data could be included in our meta-analyses of all-cause 
and cause-specific SMRs. As a result, the mortality 
advantage reported will be more representative of 
international migrants in high-income settings, and 
particularly those studying, working, or who have joined 
family members. It was not feasible to examine whether 
the observed mortality advantage changed in relation to 
time since migration, socio 
economic status, levels of 
acculturation, over time or before 2001. Despite the 
quantity of data, we did not attempt to meta-analyse 
all-cause or cause-specific estimates due to large 
differences in the reporting of outcomes across studies. 
Heterogeneity was high across analyses in this study, and 
our ability to explore this was limited by the scarcity of 
data on country of origin and migrant subgroup. In 
particular, all-cause mortality estimates for refugees were 
provided in only two studies.19,20 Previous studies of 
refugees in humanitarian settings have reported that 
refugees have excess mortality during and immediately 
after dis 
placement, but that mortality decreases to levels 
comparable with the general populations in the months to 
years afterwards when an effective humanitarian response 
is in place;48 however, we were unable to examine this 
further in our meta-analyses because data were scarce. 
Our study also highlights the limited availability of data on 
mortality in refugees, asylum seekers, and undocumented 
migrants who originate in and move to low-income and 
middle-income countries. This is an important limitation 
of the existing evidence base considering that most of the 
world’s refugees reside in other low-income and middle-
income countries close to countries of conflict. We did not 
include grey literature in our review because the aim was 
to report on the published evidence base; therefore, data 
from unpublished registries, local clinics, camps or transit 
centres are not included, and migrants in transit, 
thousands of whom die during hazardous journeys, 
were not included. Our meta-analysis included studies 
published between January, 2001, and March, 2017
. We 
updated our search from March 31, 2017, to Sept 3, 2018, 
which yielded ten additional papers49–58 that met our 
inclusion criteria that had been published since the 
original search. Of these ten studies, nine were done in 
high-income countries (two from the same dataset in 
Belgium), and were focused on international migrants 
with no disaggregation by subgroup. No studies presented 
new SMR data eligible for inclusion in our meta-analyses. 
One study done in Chad49 found that absolute mortality in 
refugees from the Central African Republic was high 
before and during migration compared with when 
individuals were settled in refugee camps, but no general 
comparator population analysis was included.
Our review provides evidence of the mortality 
advantage of migrants, but this must not be used as a 
justification for further restricting access to health care 
for migrant groups, which is an increasing issue in 
many countries.36,37 Health-care needs in migrants vary 
sub 
stantially, as shown by the heterogeneity in our 
estimates. Morbidity in migrants was not assessed by 
our study and might be higher in migrant groups, 
particularly in those who are more marginalised or of 
lower socioeconomic status. Additionally, we identified 
areas of higher need including infectious diseases. This 
is consistent with previous research in low-incidence 
infectious disease settings in high-income countries.7 
The increased infectious disease mortality is likely to be 
a result of incidence in the country of origin and not 
transmission during or after migration, which has been 
shown to be low in many high-income settings.59–61 The 
increased relative risk of mortality due to infectious 
disease reflects incidence of these diseases in the 
countries of origin and when measured in absolute 
terms is likely to be small. However, the relative increase 
in death due to HIV, tuberculosis, and viral hepatitis 
provides evidence for the need to ensure migrants from 
high-incidence countries have access to high quality 
treatment and health care, including an affirmative 
approach to improving linkage to care to reduce risk of 
death. Further research should examine how health 
services can reduce mortality and how increasingly 
restrictive health services in high-income migrant host 
countries36 might contribute to delays in accessing care 
and completing treatment, leading to poorer and more 
costly health outcomes.62 Therefore, policy makers 
should aim to develop policies that reflect the varying 
background nature of this risk in relation to country of 
origin to ensure appropriate targeting. Summary 
estimates from our study should be considered in the 
context of local epidemiology and wherever possible 
supplemented with local country and migrant group 
specific estimates to inform local and national screening 
policies. Infectious disease screening programmes 
must ensure they are not used to discriminate against, 
marginalise, or stigmatise migrants, and should only be 
done when there is evidence of health benefits to 
migrants.59,63
Our finding of raised external causes of mortality is 
particularly concerning. Evidence of increased relative 
mortality due to assaults was consistent across several 
studies in high-income countries, and was driven by 
mortality estimates for homicide. The implementation of 
effective interventions in this area will have the benefit of 
reducing mortality in both migrant and non-migrant 
populations, and therefore improve the health of the 
public generally. In addition to these policies, public 
health efforts to tackle the health threats of racism and 
xenophobia might reduce assaults on migrants.64
The scarcity of analyses by migrant subgroup 
highlights the need for further research and improved

reporting in underrepresented migrant groups. These 
limitations require more robust and consistent data 
collection and reporting in migrant health research, as 
called for by the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and 
Regular Migration,65 to strengthen the evidence base on 
migration and health.66,67 Data collection on migrants 
must be supported by a strong information governance, 
data sharing framework that ensures the appropriate 
and sensitive use of such data, and prevents its 
misuse—for example, for immigration enforcement 
purposes.68 Our study also highlights geographical 
regions with little migration data, particularly for 
migrants to and from countries in the Middle East and 
north Africa, representing an important gap in the 
global literature. Further research should investigate 
mortality patterns in migrant labour populations in the 
Middle East and north Africa, for which good records 
are likely to exist, and for displaced populations as a 
result of the conflicts in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen. Studies 
done in low-income and middle-income settings were 
par 
ticularly scarce and concerted efforts to address this 
deficit are needed.
Our systematic review and meta-analysis is a robust 
and comprehensive examination of the evidence base 
on mortality patterns in international migrants. We 
found that many international migrants in high-income 
settings had a mortality advantage compared with the 
general population. We provide further evidence for 
the positive health benefit that migrants bring to 
destination countries. Ensuring equitable access to high 
quality health care globally is crucial, regardless of 
migrant status, and is essential to facilitate, rather 
than restrict, entitlement to care for all. Our findings 
challenge popular misconceptions that mi 
grants in 
high-income settings are unhealthy and a burden to 
host societies. Instead, the findings represent an 
opportunity to reframe the public discourse from one 
that is dominated by poorly evidenced concerns about 
the risks associated with migration and health, to one 
that is evidence-based and overwhelmingly sup 
ports the 
benefits migrants provide to high-income countries.
