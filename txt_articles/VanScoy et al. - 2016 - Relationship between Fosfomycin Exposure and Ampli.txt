Understanding the relationship between antibiotic exposure and amplification of bacterial subpopulations with reduced drug
susceptibility over time is important for evaluating the adequacy of dosing regimens. We utilized a hollow-fiber infection model
to identify the fosfomycin intravenous dosing regimens that prevented the amplification of Escherichia coli bacterial subpopula-
tions with reduced fosfomycin susceptibility. The challenge isolate was E. coli ATCC 25922 (agar MIC with glucose-6-phosphate,
1 mg/liter; agar MIC without glucose-6-phosphate, 32 mg/liter). The fosfomycin dosing regimens studied were 1 to 12 g every 8 h
for 10 days to approximate that planned for clinical use. The studies included a no-treatment control regimen. Two bacterial
subpopulations were identified, one with reduced susceptibility with agar MIC values ranging from 32 to 128 mg/liter and the
other resistant with agar MIC values of 256 to >1,024 mg/liter on plates containing 5� and 256� the baseline MIC value, respec-
tively. An inverted-U-shaped function best described the relationship between the amplification of the two bacterial subpopula-
tions and drug exposure. The lowest fosfomycin dosing regimen that did not amplify a bacterial subpopulation with reduced
susceptibility was 4 g administered every 8 h. Nearly immediate amplification of bacterial subpopulations with reduced suscepti-
bility was observed with fosfomycin dosing regimens consisting of 1 to 2 g every 8 h. These data will be useful to support the se-
lection of fosfomycin dosing regimens that minimize the potential for on-therapy amplification of bacterial subpopulations with
reduced susceptibility.
R
esistance of Enterobacteriaceae to antibiotics remains a
global clinical concern. One risk factor for the emergence
of antibiotic resistance is suboptimal drug exposure, which
may be further exacerbated in at-risk patient populations.
Those patient populations at risk for the development of anti-
biotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae infections include but are
not limited to those with prolonged hospitalization, immuno-
compromised status, and a neurological diagnosis (1). One way
to reduce the likelihood of the emergence of on-therapy anti-
biotic resistance is to utilize dosing regimens that result in
exposures sufficient to prevent the amplification of bacterial
subpopulations with reduced susceptibility.
The hollow-fiber infection model has been utilized to charac-
terize the relationship between drug exposure and resistance am-
plification over time (2, 3, 4). For ceftolozane-tazobactam, the
relationship between drug exposure and resistance amplification
of CTX-M-15-producing Escherichia coli resembled an inverted-
U-shape function (3). Using this relationship, dosing regimens
less likely to amplify resistant bacterial subpopulations were iden-
tified.
There has been considerable interest in the use of fosfomy-
cin oral and intravenous (ZTI-01) formulations for infections
associated with multidrug-resistant bacteria (5, 6). Fosfomycin
has a broad spectrum of in vitro activity, including Enterobac-
teriaceae producing extended-spectrum �-lactamase (ESBL)
enzymes (7). Given the renewed clinical interest and spectrum
of fosfomycin in vitro activity, the goal of the studies described
herein was to use an in vitro hollow-fiber infection model to
identify the fosfomycin dosing regimen that prevented the am-
plification of Escherichia coli subpopulations with reduced fos-
fomycin susceptibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacteria, antimicrobials, and �-lactamase inhibitor. The fosfomycin in-
travenous solution (ZTI-01) was provided by Zavante Therapeutics, Inc.
(San Diego, CA). The challenge isolate was Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
(Manassas, VA).
Media and in vitro susceptibility studies. All studies described here
were completed using Mueller-Hinton (MH) broth and MH agar media
(BD Laboratories, Franklin Lakes, NJ) with or without supplementation
with 25 mg/liter of glucose-6-phosphate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO).
Susceptibility studies were performed in triplicate over a 2-day period
using agar dilution methodology as described in Clinical and Laboratory
Standards Institute guidelines (8). In order to understand the conditions
represented within the dynamic in vitro model, broth dilution suscepti-
bilities were also determined. The MIC results presented represent the
modal values for these studies.
Mutation frequency studies. The mutation frequency of drug resis-
tance (density) was estimated using a previously described methodology
(3, 9). In brief, the ratio of the total bacterial population to the bacterial
subpopulations with reduced fosfomycin susceptibility found within a
bacterial suspension was determined by plating 4 ml of log-phase growth
suspension onto fosfomycin-containing agar plates. The growth medium
was MH agar supplemented with 25 mg/liter of glucose-6-phosphate, and

 fosfomycin concentrations were either 5� or 256� the baseline fosfomy-
cin agar MIC value. The concentration of fosfomycin on the drug-con-
taining plates was based upon the results of the previously described sus-
ceptibility studies (10), which represented drug concentrations greater
than baseline MIC values with and without the presence of glucose-6-
phosphate. The bacterial concentration within the suspension was deter-
mined by quantitative culture, and the ratio of growth found on the drug-
containing plates to that of the starting inoculum was used to provide an
estimate of the frequency of drug resistance within the total population.
This assay was performed in duplicate, and for each study, a subset of
isolates was taken from the drug-containing plates and evaluated for
change in the MIC from baseline to confirm decreased susceptibility using
agar dilution methodology (8).
Hollow-fiber infection model. The hollow-fiber infection model has
been described previously (3, 11). In brief, this pharmacodynamic system
allows for a challenge isolate to be exposed to simulated human pharma-
cokinetic profiles of a study compound. The system consists of a periph-
eral chamber, which is separated from the central compartment by semi-
permeable membranes. These membranes contain pores with diameters
that are large enough to allow nutrients, drugs, and bacterial metabolites
to transverse freely into and out of the peripheral compartment but too
small for bacteria to leave the peripheral compartment. Fresh drug-free
medium is circulated through the hollow-fiber cartridge from the central
compartment using peristaltic pumps. The challenge compound is
pumped into the central compartment under computer control and is
continually diluted in the central compartment, simulating a targeted
half-life, without diluting the pathogen in the peripheral compartment.
Due to the high surface area-to-volume ratio, drug concentrations equil-
ibrate rapidly in the periphery. The peripheral compartment contains
sampling ports which allow for the sampling of the target organism over
multiple time points throughout the study duration.
Fosfomycin dose-ranging studies. In the dose-ranging studies, the
initial inoculum of the challenge isolate was prepared using a previously
described methodology (3, 4). In brief, the challenge inoculum was grown
from an overnight culture in Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5%
sheep blood (BD Laboratories) at 35°C. Colonies were removed from the
overnight growth plate and suspended in MH broth medium supple-
mented with glucose-6-phosphate. The bacterial concentration within the
flask of MH broth was determined by optical density and a growth curve
for the challenge isolate. A bacterial suspension, representing a concen-
tration of 1.0 � 108 CFU/ml, was inoculated into the extracapillary space
of the hollow-fiber cartridges (FiberCell Systems, Frederick, MD). Within
the hollow-fiber cartridge, bacteria were exposed to fluctuating free-
drug fosfomycin concentrations that simulated a human half-life of 2
h and exposures representing doses of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 g administered
every 8 h (q8h) (12). A no-treatment control regimen was evaluated
for comparison. All studies were performed in duplicate.
Over the course of the 10-day experiment, 1.5-ml samples were taken
from the extracapillary space, washed twice with sterile normal saline to
prevent drug carryover, serially diluted, and quantitatively cultured on
drug-free Trypticase soy agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood to de-
termine the effect of treatment on the total bacterial population. A portion
of each sample was plated on MH agar plates containing 5� and 256� the
baseline agar MIC of fosfomycin for confirmation of the bacterial sub-
populations with reduced susceptibility. MIC values were determined for
a subset of isolates found growing on the drug-containing plates on days 1,
3, 6, and 10 of each study using agar dilution methodology supplemented
with glucose-6-phosphate.
Pharmacokinetic validation. Over the first 48 h of each of the above-
described studies, 1-ml samples were collected from the peripheral com-
partment at 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 23, 25, 27, 29, and 48 h. All samples were imme-
diately frozen at �80°C until assayed for concentration of fosfomycin.
Bioanalytical method. Fosfomycin concentrations were determined
via biological assay. Two hundred microliters of E. coli ATCC 25922 was
grown to log phase in MH broth supplemented with 25 mg/liter of glu-
cose-6-phosphate. The suspension was diluted to a concentration of 1.0 �
106 CFU/ml and inoculated onto the surface of an MH agar plate supple-
mented with 25 mg/liter of glucose-6-phosphate. A series of 4.8-mm-
diameter wells were aseptically bored into the agar of each plate. A volume
of 15 �l was taken from each pharmacokinetic sample, deposited into the
individual wells, and incubated for 18 h at 35°C. The fosfomycin standard
curve was logarithmic over concentrations ranging from 10 to 500 mg/
liter, with a lower quantification limit of 10 mg/liter.
RESULTS
In vitro susceptibility studies. The fosfomycin susceptibility test
results against E. coli ATCC 25922 are shown in Table 1. When
tested using the agar dilution methodology with glucose-6-phos-
pate supplementation, per Clinical and Laboratory Standards In-
stitute guidelines (8), the fosfomycin MIC value (1 mg/liter) was
within the quality control range (0.5 to 2 mg/liter) (13). When
tested without glucose-6-phospate, the fosfomycin MIC value for
E. coli ATCC 25922 increased to 32 mg/liter.
Mutation frequency studies. The average densities of the
bacterial subpopulations with reduced susceptibility, which
were determined at 5� and 256� the baseline MIC value, were
1 fosfomycin-resistant CFU in every 2.5 � 108 and 1 fosfomycin-
resistant in every �9.5 � 108 CFU/ml, respectively. The MIC
value of the subpopulation at 5� the baseline MIC was 16 to 64
mg/liter. The MIC value of the subpopulation at 256� the base-
line MIC could not be determined due to lack of growth on the
drug-containing plates.
Pharmacokinetic validation of targeted fosfomycin regi-
mens. The targeted fosfomycin pharmacokinetic profiles were
well simulated within the hollow-fiber infection model (Fig. 1), as
evidenced by the good agreement between the observed and tar-
geted concentration-time profiles (r2 � 0.98, slope � 0.927, inter-
cept � 9.46).
Fosfomycin dose-ranging studies. Figure 2 shows the average
bacterial density of the total population and colonies observed on
agar plates containing 5� and 256� the MIC over 10 days for each
dosing regimen examined. The bacteria grew well in the no-treat-
ment control regimens, as evidenced by the increase in average

 bacterial density from 1.0 � 107.9 to 1.0 � 1010.7 CFU/ml over 2
days. Two bacterial subpopulations emerged over time. The initial
average density of the bacterial subpopulation with decreased fos-
fomycin susceptibility that grew on plates containing 5� the base-
line MIC of fosfomycin was 1.0 � 102.7 CFU/ml; the average den-
sity of this bacterial subpopulation increased to 1.0 � 106.3
CFU/ml on day 10. The initial density of the resistant subpopulation
that grew on plates containing 256� the baseline fosfomycin MIC
was not detected but increased to 1.0 � 104.2 CFU/ml by day 10.
As shown in Fig. 2, there was a wide range of drug effect across
the fosfomycin dosing regimens evaluated. The lowest fosfomycin
dosing regimen (1 g q8h) produced an initial decrease in bacterial
burden of 1 log10 CFU/ml after 5 h of therapy. This initial reduc-
tion in bacterial burden was observed only in the total population,
which was replaced by the bacterial subpopulation with reduced
susceptibility on day 1. The bacterial subpopulation observed on
the agar plates containing 256� the baseline MIC increased in
density but never achieved densities matching the total popula-
tion. The majority of the total population (approximately
99.99%) represented the bacterial subpopulation observed on the
agar plates containing 5� the baseline MIC. A similar pattern of
results was observed for the fosfomycin 2 g q8h dosing regimen.
The larger fosfomycin dosing regimens (4, 8, and 12 g q8h) re-
sulted in a rapid reduction of the total bacterial population and
prevented the emergence of both bacterial subpopulations. On
day 10, the three most intensive fosfomycin dosing regimens ster-
ilized the hollow-fiber model system.
Figure 3 shows the relationship between the change in log10
CFU/ml from baseline on day 10 of both bacterial subpopulations
with reduced susceptibility and the fosfomycin dosing regimen.
The relationship between fosfomycin dosing regimen and change
in log10 CFU/ml from baseline on day 10 of each subpopulation
took the form of an inverted U. The fosfomycin MIC values of the
isolates grown on plates supplemented with 5� and 256� the
baseline MIC of fosfomycin increased in parallel with duration of
therapy and were determined to be 32 to 128 and 256 to �1,024
mg/liter, respectively.
DISCUSSION
The objective of these studies was to use an in vitro hollow-fiber
infection model to identify the fosfomycin dosing regimen that
prevented the amplification of E. coli subpopulations with re-
duced fosfomycin susceptibility. The q8h dosing interval was se-
lected to match the dosing frequency to be used in an upcoming
clinical trial involving patients with complicated urinary tract in-
fections. E. coli was selected as the challenge organism due to the
prevalence of this pathogen in patients with complicated urinary
tract infections (14).
We successfully discriminated among fosfomycin dosing regi-
mens and identified those that prevented the emergence of bacte-
rial subpopulations with reduced susceptibility from those that

 amplified such subpopulations. The least intensive fosfomycin
dosing regimens (1 and 2 g q8h) failed, with replacement of the
susceptible population with the bacterial subpopulation with re-
duced susceptibility for the 1 g q8h dosing regimen and with the
bacterial subpopulation with reduced susceptibility and the resis-
tant bacterial subpopulation for the 2 g q8h dosing regimen. The
bacterial subpopulation found on the agar plates with 5� the
baseline fosfomycin MIC replaced the susceptible population by
day 1 of the study. The bacterial subpopulation observed on the
plates containing 256� the baseline MIC never fully replaced the
total bacterial population for the 1 g q8h dosing regimen; for the 2
g q8h dosing regimen, the bacterial subpopulation reached that of
the total population. The MIC values of the isolates collected from
the supplemented agar plates containing 5� and 256� the base-
line MIC ranged from 32 to 128 mg/liter and from 256 to �1,024
mg/liter, respectively. Of note, fosfomycin MIC values of �256
mg/liter for Enterobacteriaceae are resistant per the Clinical Labo-
ratory and Standards Institute (13). These results are concordant
with those observed by Nilsson et al., in which the number of
resistance determinants increased and the biological fitness de-
creased as an isolate’s fosfomycin MIC increased (15).
The most intensive fosfomycin dosing regimens (4, 8, and 12 g
q8h) prevented the emergence and amplification of the bacterial
subpopulations with reduced susceptibility. Moreover, these dos-
ing regimens all resulted in a rapid reduction of the total bacterial
population and ultimately sterilized the hollow-fiber infection
model. A marked difference in the time to model sterilization for
the 4, 8, and 12 g q8h dosing regimens was not detected. The
number of CFU recovered in each of the more intensive dosing
regimens approached zero by day 4 of the study.
The relationship between fosfomycin dose and the amplifica-
tion of bacterial subpopulations with reduced susceptibility was
hormetic (inverted U) in nature. Such relationships were first de-
scribed in 1888 by Hugo Paul Friedrich Schulz (16) in studies
involving yeast exposed to formic acid and more recently by oth-
ers (2, 3, 4). The explanation for this phenomenon with the data
described here is the presence of two bacterial subpopulations
with different drug susceptibilities, which over certain exposure
ranges drives the response in opposite directions (cell growth ver-
sus cell kill). The in vitro hollow-fiber infection model has been
proven to be a useful system for the examination of exposure-
response relationships of this nature (2, 3, 4, 17, 18). Indeed, this
phenomenon has also been observed using data from daptomy-
cin-treated patients with Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia with or
without infective endocarditis. At 30 days after the start of therapy,
the relationship between the probability of decreased susceptibil-
ity and AUC/MIC ratio resembled an inverted-U shape (19). The
strength of the in vitro hollow-fiber infection model is that drug
exposures beyond those that can be attained clinically can be ex-
amined. Given this capability, drug exposures can be identified
that not only amplify resistance but also inhibit the growth of
resistant subpopulations over a clinically relevant duration of
therapy. Conducting such study earlier in drug development al-
lows for discrimination among dosing regimens and the identifi-
cation of those dosing regimens with a reduced probability of
amplifying bacterial subpopulations with reduced susceptibility
before clinical trials are conducted. The use of this approach is
predicted to increase the duration of time that a given dosing
regimen will be clinically useful.
The major limitation of the studies described herein was that
they involved the evaluation of a single isolate. Thus, additional
work with multiple E. coli isolates that manifest a broad range of
resistance determinants is warranted. Moreover, studies involving
other Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa will enrich
our understanding of the fosfomycin exposures necessary to de-
crease the probability of on-therapy resistance emergence. A sec-
ond limitation of these studies is that the effect of the immune
system on the eradication of the bacterial population and subpop-
ulation was not considered. However, despite this limitation,
studies have shown concordant findings with respect to the devel-
opment of resistance under in vitro conditions and clinical settings
after administration of the same dosing regimen (20, 21).
In conclusion, we successfully discriminated among fosfomy-
cin dosing regimens that prevented the emergence of E. coli sub-
populations with reduced drug susceptibility and identified those
dosing regimens that amplified the emergence of such subpopu-
lations. Fosfomycin dosing regimens of 4, 8, and 12 g q8h pre-
vented the emergence of bacterial subpopulations with reduced
drug susceptibility and, by day 4, drove the entire bacterial popu-
lation toward extinction. These data will be useful to support the
selection of fosfomycin dosing regimens that minimize the poten-
tial for on-therapy amplification of bacterial subpopulations with
reduced fosfomycin susceptibility.
