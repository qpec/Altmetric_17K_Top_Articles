Abstract
Neuropathic pain is an important medical problem with few effective treatments. The sigma 1 
receptor (σ1R) is known to be a potential target for neuropathic pain therapeutics, and antagonists 
for this receptor are effective in preclinical models and are currently in phase II clinical trials. 
Conversely, relatively little is known about σ2R, which has recently been identified as 
transmembrane protein 97 (Tmem97). We generated a series of σ1R and σ2R/Tmem97 agonists 
and antagonists and tested them for efficacy in the mouse spared nerve injury (SNI) model. In 
agreement with previous reports, we find that σ1R ligands given intrathecally (IT) produce relief 
of SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity. We also find that the putative σ2R/Tmem97 agonists 
DKR-1005, DKR-1051, and UKH-1114 (Ki ~ 46 nM) lead to relief of SNI-induced mechanical 
hypersensitivity, peaking at 48 h after dosing when given IT. This effect is blocked by the putative 
σ2R/Tmem97 antagonist SAS-0132. Systemic administration of UKH-1114 (10 mg/kg) relieves 
SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity for 48 h with a peak magnitude of effect equivalent to 
100 mg/kg gabapentin and without producing any motor impairment. Finally, we find that the 
TMEM97 gene is expressed in mouse and human dorsal root ganglion (DRG) including 
populations of neurons that are involved in pain; however, the gene is also likely expressed in non-
neuronal cells that may contribute to the observed behavioral effects. Our results show robust 
antineuropathic pain effects of σ1R and σ2R/Tmem97 ligands, demonstrate that σ2R/Tmem97 is a 
novel neuropathic pain target, and identify UKH-1114 as a lead molecule for further development.

INTRODUCTION
Neuropathic pain is a common medical problem that is very poorly treated by current 
therapeutics. Recent meta-analyses show that the most widely prescribed drugs for 
neuropathic pain only achieve 50% pain relief in 1 of 4 patients for the antidepressants (e.g., 
monoamine oxidase inhibitors) and are effective in as few as 1 in 7 patients for the 
gabapentinoids.1 Better therapeutics are clearly needed for neuropathic pain. Sigma 
receptors (σRs) are unique transmembrane proteins expressed throughout the CNS (central 
nervous system) and in certain peripheral tissues. Consisting of two subtypes, the sigma 1 
receptor (σ1R) and the sigma 2 receptor (σ2R), these proteins are involved in intracellular 
ion regulation and neuron survival.2 σ1R has been cloned and a crystal structure of the 
receptor obtained.3 The involvement of this receptor in pain signaling has been studied 
extensively, and a variety of compounds that bind to σ1R demonstrate antinociceptive 
effects.4 E-52862,5 a σ1R antagonist, is currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment 
of neuropathic pain as both a monotherapy and in a multidrug cocktail.
Although strong evidence supports a role for σ1R in neuropathic pain, σ2R has not been 
explored as a pain target, and the molecular identity of this receptor has been challenging to 
pinpoint. Molecular cloning recently confirmed the identify of σ2R as transmembrane 
protein 97 (Tmem97),6 and this receptor will accordingly be referred to as σ2R/Tmem97 
herein unless we are referring to the Tmem97 mouse or TMEM97 human genes. σ2R/
Tmem97 is a gene product that appears to be involved in cholesterol trafficking and 
homeostasis and interacts with NPC-1, a protein responsible for shuttling lipids to 
postlysosomal locations.7–9 σ2R/Tmem97 is involved in regulating intracellular Ca2+ 
concentration, and certain σ2R/Tmem97 ligands can induce a transient rise in intracellular 
Ca2+ levels,2 while other compounds that bind to σ2R/Tmem97 suppress Ca2+ influx in the 
presence of an inducer.10 Some evidence suggests that compounds that bind to σ2R/
Tmem97 modulate a signaling pathway involving progesterone receptor membrane 
component one (PGRMC111),10 a heme binding protein12 involved in cell survival2 and 
apoptosis.13 With respect to medical relevance, it is noteworthy that TMEM97 has been 
implicated in the metabolic disorder, Niemann-Pick disease,9 as well as in multiple 
neurodegenerative and neurological conditions.14 Indeed, small molecules that bind to σ2R/
Tmem97 are emerging as potential therapeutics for a range of CNS disorders, including 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD)15 and schizophrenia.16

 We have discovered that the chlorinated norbenzomorphan and methanobenzazocine 
scaffolds 1 and 2 (Figure 1) are excellent templates for preparing both selective and mixed 
affinity σ1R and σ2R/Tmem97 ligands.17 In the context of CNS lead development, these 
scaffolds are of particular interest because of their drug-like properties18,19 and the ease with 
which they cross the blood brain barrier, as demonstrated by representative compounds 
SAS-013210 and DKR-1051 (Figure 1). In vivo testing has revealed that some compounds 
derived from 1 and 2 have promising medicinal properties that may warrant further 
preclinical development. For example, certain σ2R/Tmem97 ligands are neuroprotective10 
and also restore cognitive function in transgenic AD mice10,20 as well as in aged, 
nondiseased animals,10 the latter of which suggests σ2R/Tmem97 may be a potential target 
for treating mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite this increasing knowledge base and 
the emergence of tool ligands for probing σ2R/Tmem97, the involvement of σ2R/Tmem97 
in neuropathic pain has not yet been reported.
Herein we describe the antineuropathic pain properties of a series of σ1R and σ2R/Tmem97 
ligands in mice. We report that molecules that bind to σ2R/Tmem97 as putative agonists 
exert a profound effect on mechanical hypersensitivity in the spared nerve injury (SNI) 
model with a duration of action and potency that is superior to that of gabapentin. Small 
molecule modulation of σ2R/Tmem97 may thus represent a new approach for managing 
pain by a previously unexplored mechanism of action.
RESULTS
Screening of σ1R and σ2R/Tmem97 Ligands for Activity in the Mouse SNI Model
Several previous studies have demonstrated that σ1R antagonists show efficacy in rodent 
neuropathic pain models via a spinal mechanism of action,21–23 but the possible effect of 
σ2R/Tmem97 ligands in this model has not been explored. We screened a series of σ1R and 
σ2R/Tmem97 ligands (Figure 2) for activity in the SNI model via a single IT injection. We 
chose this route of administration because σ1R antagonists have been shown to be active in 
rodent pain models with IT injection,21,24 and because we had incomplete knowledge of 
compound disposition in vivo with systemic dosing.
We first assessed the σ1R preferring ligands, JWG-1014, JSS-1027, and MFG-1046, all 
given at 10 μg doses, and observed antipain effects for all three compounds that were 
significantly different from vehicle. JWG-1014 and JSS-1027 (Figure 8) both demonstrated 
efficacy 48 h post IT injection, and this effect persisted through 120 h after ligand 
administration (Figure 3). Faster onset of action was observed with MFG-1046 (Figure 9), 
which elicited an antipain effect at 24 h that continued through 72 h after IT injection 
(Figure 3).
We then tested four σ2R/Tmem97 preferring ligands of the norbenzomorphan and 
methanobenzazocine structural class, as well as the known σ2R/Tmem97 agonist, 
siramesine.25–27 Siramesine induced a small inhibitory effect on mechanical hypersensitivity 
that was significant at 24 and 48 h (Figure 4A). On the other hand, DKR-1005, DKR-1051, 
and UKH-1114 all produced significant antimechanical hypersensitivity effects at either 24 
or 48 h after IT injection (Figure 4B).

 Based on the observed in vivo effects of the four σ2R/Tmem97 preferring ligands examined, 
tentative functional activity assignments were made. Compounds DKR-1005, DKR-1051, 
and UKH-1114 elicited pronounced and sustained antinociceptive effects. However, when 
UKH-1114 was administered with SAS-0132, the antinociceptive action of UKH-1114 was 
abolished (Figure 5). Because UKH-1114 elicits a significant antipain effect that is 
completely blocked by SAS-0132, we surmise that UKH-1114 is a σ2R/Tmem97 agonist 
(or partial agonist) and that σ2R/Tmem97 agonism is responsible for the antimechanical 
hypersensitivity effects observed with these compounds in SNI mice. On the other hand, 
SAS-0132 appears to function as a σ2R/Tmem97 antagonist by suppressing the action of 
UKH-1114. Indeed, these findings are consistent with our previous work that showed that 
SAS-0132 behaves as a σ2R/Tmem97 antagonist, whereas DKR-1051 acts as a σ2R 
agonist10 based upon their opposing effects upon Ca2+ in SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. 
Namely, treatment of SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells with DKR-1051 induces a rapid Ca2+ 
transient, and this effect is attenuated when cells are pretreated with SAS-0132.
Systemic Administration of σ2R/Tmem97 Agonist Alleviates Neuropathic Pain
Of the putative σ2R/Tmem97 agonists we tested, UKH-1114 had the largest behavioral 
effect, and its chemical properties and high selectivity for σ2R/Tmem97 versus >50 other 
proteins (See Tables 1 and 2) make it an eligible candidate for systemic dosing.
Therefore, we injected UKH-1114 IV in mice at 10 mg/kg and compared the effect of the 
compound to the gold-standard antineuropathic pain treatment, gabapentin (100 mg/kg). 
Gabapentin completely reversed mechanical hypersensitivity at 1 and 3 h after injection, but 
animals were fully mechanically hypersensitive again 24 h after IV injection. UKH-1114 
also produced a complete reversal of mechanical hypersensitivity but with a different time 
course (Figure 6A). A significant effect was observed at both 24 and 48 h after injection 
indicating that pain relief from this mechanism lasts longer than that produced with a 10-
fold larger dose of gabapentin.
Because the mechanism of action of σ2R/Tmem97 ligands for neuropathic pain relief is not 
known, we were concerned that this effect could be produced by motor impairment. To test 
this possibility we used the rotorod test. SNI mice were given IV vehicle or UKH-1114 and 
tested at the peak time point for alleviation of neuropathic pain, 48 h after injection. There 
was no effect of UKH-1114 on motor performance (Figure 6B) ruling out the possibility of 
motor impairment.
Tmem97 Gene Expression Analysis in Mouse and Human Tissues
To gain insight into where σ2R/Tmem97 is expressed, we quantified Tmem97 mRNA 
relative abundance in mouse DRG as well as additional tissues, and their orthologous tissues 
in humans, based on publicly available sequencing data (human data sets: GTex project,28 
ENCODE project,29 Uhlén et al.,30 Duff et al.,31 and the UTD DRG project;32 mouse data 
sets: mouse ENCODE project,33 Rakic et al.,34 Gerhold et al.,35 Eipper-Mains et al.,36 and 
Huan et al.37). We find that Tmem97 gene expression and its human orthologue (TMEM97) 
are ubiquitously expressed in a wide range of tissues, with higher expression in the human 
and mouse gastrointestinal (GI) tract commensurate with its role in cholesterol trafficking7

 (Figure 7A). While expression levels in the human DRG is high, both single cell38 and 
bulk35 RNA-seq for mouse DRGs identify gene expression, but at lower levels than in 
human (Figure 7A). TMEM97/Tmem97 is also relatively highly expressed in human and 
mouse spinal cord. While the detection rate for Tmem97 across mouse DRG neuronal 
subpopulations is relatively low, it is clearly expressed in subpopulations of peptidergic and 
nonpeptidergic nociceptors (Figure 7B). Given the high TPM levels in mouse and human 
DRG, Tmem97 may also be expressed in non-neuronal cells in DRG (e.g., satellite glial 
cells or Schwann cells). Unfortunately, mouse DRG glial transcriptomes have not been 
characterized, so we turned to a CNS tissue where these cell populations have available 
transcriptomes. We find that in adult cerebral cortex,39 Tmem97 expression in cortical glial 
cells can be enriched 2-fold or more over neuronal expression levels (Figure 7C), lending 
credence to the hypothesis of glial expression of Tmem97 in the DRG and/or spinal cord.
DISCUSSION
Several primary conclusions may be reached based upon the work described herein. First, 
our results using distinct σ1R binding ligands are consistent with previous demonstrations 
that σ1R antagonists reduce nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity.21,40 This 
observation suggests that the σ1R binding ligands described herein might be antagonists. 
Second, we find that σ2R/Tmem97 ligands DKR-1005, DKR-1051, and UKH-1114 bind 
σ2R/Tmem97 with high affinity and produce antinociceptive effects when administered IT 
to SNI mice. UKH-1114 is the most efficacious of these compounds in vivo, producing a 
strong antinociceptive effect when administered IV that was longer lasting and equally 
efficacious at 1/10 the dose of gabapentin. UKH-1114 is highly selective for σ2R/Tmem97 
binding with an affinity 28-fold greater at σ2R/Tmem97 than at σ1R, and with negligible 
affinity for 55 other targets (Table 2). While TMEM97/Tmem97 is expressed in DRG and 
spinal cord of humans and mice, the gene is likely expressed in a mix of neuronal and non-
neuronal cells that may include key glial and/or immune cells that are thought to play an 
important role in the pathogenesis of neuropathic pain.41 Therefore, we conclude the σ2R/
Tmem97 is a promising target for the generation of neuropathic pain drugs.
An interesting aspect of our behavioral findings is the relatively long onset of action of the 
compounds that we tested compared to rapid onset actions in previous studies with distinct 
ligands.21,40,42,43 There could be several reasons for this observation. One is that most 
previous studies have looked at short time points after administration of σ1R antagonists (30 
or 45 min) or at repeated dosing effects21,40,42,43 so it is possible that effects with a slower 
onset are missed by these acute dosing schedules but are part of the sustained efficacy 
observed with repeated dosing. Another possibility is that while the mechanism of action of 
σ1R antagonists in pain was first thought to involve a spinal mechanism of action,21–23 more 
recent studies suggest an action of DRG neurons where σ1R is also expressed.44 It is 
therefore probable that the time to onset of effects is due to the time that is needed for the 
drug to diffuse to sites of action that are more distant from the injection site in the intrathecal 
space. Because σ1Rs are found on the nuclear envelop of DRG neurons,44 yet another 
possibility is that the effect of these compounds is transcriptional. If this were the case, this 
would also potentially take longer to manifest as a behavioral change. These considerations 
aside, our results are consistent with previous studies where σ1R antagonists produced long

 lasting relief of neuropathic mechanical hypersensitivity when given IT.21 Another important 
consideration here is that all of the compounds we examined as σ1R binding ligands also 
have affinity at σ2R/Tmem97 that could alter their behavioral effects, and some of them 
have affinity in the low nM range (JSS-1027 and MFG-1046).
To our knowledge, σ2R/Tmem97 ligands have not been previously tested for antinociceptive 
effects. The σ2R/Tmem97 ligands described herein have high affinity for σ2R/Tmem97, 
have good specificity relative to σ1R binding, and have little affinity for other targets in a 
small specificity screen. Indeed, UKH-1114 displays exceptional selectivity for σ2R/
Tmem97 over >50 other receptors and channels. Although the previously described σ2R/
Tmem97 agonist, siramesine, produced only a small effect in SNI mice, several other 
putative σ2R/Tmem97 agonists produced strong effects when given IT in the SNI model. 
This effect was blocked in the case of UKH-1114 by the known σ2R/Tmem97 antagonist, 
SAS-0132, strongly implicating σ2R/Tmem97 agonism as the mode of action responsible 
for antinociception. UKH-1114 was chosen to test via systemic administration in the SNI 
model. This compound produced a strong antimechanical hypersensitivity effect that was 
long lasting and devoid of motor impairment. The peak magnitude of effect was equivalent 
to the standard of care neuropathic pain drug, gabapentin, but it was much longer lasting at 
10-fold lower dose. We observed a relatively long onset to antinociceptive action with 
putative σ2R/Tmem97 agonists, like σ1R ligands, although this onset to action was shorter 
when UKH-1114 was given IV. This may be explained by the expression of the Tmem97 
gene, which is clearly expressed in structures outside of the intrathecal space and has high 
expression in the DRG and in non-neuronal cells in the DRG and CNS, suggesting the 
possibility of immune cell expression. We mined publicly available data sets and found that 
Tmem97 mRNA is expressed in many mouse and human tissues, but in the mouse CNS, 
expression levels are apparently higher in many non-neuronal cells types, including 
astrocytes and microglia. This is consistent with the known expression of TMEM97 in 
human glioma cells.45 While beyond the scope of the present experiments, the discovery of 
tool ligands to manipulate σ2R/Tmem97 function will allow for testing the role of this 
receptor in a variety of cell types in the pain pathway.
More work is clearly needed to understand the role of σ2R/Tmem97 in pain, but these 
unprecedented results provide compelling support for developing σ2R/Tmem97 agonists as 
a novel strategy for the pharmacological management of neuropathic pain, bringing forth the 
possibility for patients to experience enhanced pain relief and reduced side-effects by 
modulating a receptor not targeted by currently approved FDA drugs. We are in the process 
of identifying other σ2R/Tmem97 agonists to further explore their utility as potential 
therapeutics for neuropathic pain.

All animal procedures were approved by The University of Texas at Dallas Institutional 
animal care and use committee (IACUC) and were in accordance with National Institutes of 
Health Guidelines. All of the experiments were performed on male C57Bl6/J mice obtained 
from Envigo at 4 weeks of age. Mice were housed in the University of Texas at Dallas

 Animal Care Facility for at least 1 week prior to the start of behavior testing and surgery. 
Animals had ad libitum access to food and water and were on a 12 h noninverted light/dark 
cycle. Experimenters were blinded to treatment groups in behavioral experiments. Sample 
size was estimated by performing a power calculation using G*Power (version 3.1.9.2). 
With 80% power, an expectation of d = 2.2 effect size in behavioral experiments, and alpha 
set to 0.05, the sample size required was calculated as n = 5 per group. Standard deviation 
(set at 0.3) for the power calculation was based on previously published mechanical 
threshold data.46–48
Behavioral Testing
Mechanical sensitivity was assessed using stimulation of the hindpaw of the mouse with 
calibrated von Frey filaments from Stoelting. We used the modified up–down method 
described previously.49 Following baseline testing, neuropathic pain was induced in mice 
using the SNI surgery model. This surgery consists of exposing and cutting the peroneal and 
tibial branches of the sciatic nerve leaving the sural nerve intact.50 Two-weeks postsurgery, 
mechanical sensitivity testing was repeated to ensure that mechanical hypersensitivity had 
indeed been produced. Following this test, groups of SNI mice were treated with intrathecal 
(IT) injections51 of test compounds given in a volume of 5 μL made up in sterile saline and 
mechanical sensitivity was assessed at time points indicated in figures. Screening for the 
effect of IT injection of test compounds on SNI-induced mechanical hypersensitivity was 
done between 21 and 60 days after SNI. Some groups of mice were tested with multiple 
compounds to reduce the number of animals that were needed for this study. If mice were 
given multiple injections they were always spaced by at least 14 days between injections. 
Some animals received a maximum of 3 IT injections but most received 2. In some 
experiments drugs were given by intravenous (IV) injection through the tail vein in a volume 
of 100 μL in sterile saline and mechanical sensitivity was assessed at time points indicated in 
figures. RotoRod testing was done on an automated rotorod device set to accelerate to a final 
speed of 40 rotations per minute over a 200 s time course. Mice were trained on the rotorod 
twice and latency to fall was recorded on the third trial.
Chemical Synthesis and Characterization
Toluene was dried by filtration through one column of activated, neutral alumina followed 
by one column of Q5 reactant52 and was determined to have less than 50 ppm of H2O by 
Karl Fischer coulometric moisture analysis. Acetonitrile (CH3CN), diethyl ether (Et2O), 
ethyl acetate (EtOAc), methanol (MeOH), methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), 1,2-dichloroethane 
(DCE), triethylamine (Et3N), and diisopropylethylamine (i-Pr2NEt) were used without 
further purification. All reagents were reagent grade and used without purification unless 
otherwise noted. All reactions involving air or moisture sensitive reagents or intermediates 
were performed under an inert atmosphere of nitrogen or argon in glassware that was flame 
or oven-dried. Reaction temperatures refer to the temperature of the cooling/heating bath. 
Volatile solvents were removed under reduced pressure using a Buchi rotary evaporator at 
20–30 °C (bath temperature). Thin layer chromatography was run on precoated plates of 
silica gel with a 0.25 mm thickness containing 60F-254 indicator (EMD Millipore). 
Chromatography was performed using forced flow (flash chromatography) and the indicated 
solvent system on 230–400 mesh silica gel (Silicycle flash F60) according to the method of

 Still and colleagues53 unless otherwise noted. Radial Preparative Liquid Chromatography 
(radial plc) was performed on a Chromatotron using glass plates coated with Merck, TLC 
grade 7749 silica gel with gypsum binder and fluorescent indicator.
Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance (13C 
NMR) spectra were obtained at the indicated field as solutions in CDCl3 unless otherwise 
indicated. Chemical shifts are referenced to the deuterated solvent (e.g., for CDCl3, δ = 7.26 
ppm and 77.0 ppm for 1H and 13C NMR, respectively) and are reported in parts per million 
(ppm, δ) relative to tetramethylsilane (TMS, δ = 0.00 ppm). Coupling constants (J) are 
reported in Hz and the splitting abbreviations used are s, singlet; d, doublet; t, triplet; q, 
quartet; m, multiplet; comp, overlapping multiplets of magnetically nonequivalent protons; 
br, broad; app, apparent. Molecular mass was determined using an LCMS system comprised 
of an Agilent 1200 Series HPLC and an Agilent 6130 single quadrupole mass spectrometer. 
Samples were injected onto a Phenomenex Gemini C18 column (5 μm, 2.1 × 50 mm) and 
eluted at 0.7 mL/min using a gradient of 10–90% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (11 min 
linear ramp). Positive mode electrospray ionization ESI was used to verify the identity of the 
major component. All compounds submitted for in vivo testing were >95% purity as 
determined by LC via AUC at 214- and 254 nm. Experimental and characterization data for 
1,54 S4, S5, SAS-0132,55 and DKR-1005 have been reported previously, and the preparation 
of the nor-chloro analogue of 2 has been described.56

A mixture of 1 (150 mg, 0.45 mmol) and 10% Pd/C (45 wt %, 60 mg) in ethanol (5 mL) was 
stirred under an atmosphere of H2 for 6.5 h. The catalyst was removed by filtration through a 
cotton plug, and the combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to provide 
71 mg of a light brown oil, which was dissolved in CH3CN (5 mL). (2-Phenyl)ethyl bromide 
(S1, 0.13 mL, 0.90 mmol) and K2CO3 (248 mg, 1.8 mmol) were added, and the mixture was 
heated at 50 °C for 20 h. The reaction was cooled to room temperature and the solids 
removed by filtration. The combined filtrates were concentrated to give a yellow oil that was 
purified using radial plc, eluting with 100% hexanes → 20% EtOAc/hexanes, to give 90 mg

Iodotrimethylsilane (318 mg, 0.226 mL 1.59 mmol) was added in one portion to a solution 
of carbamate S4 (300 mg, 0.797 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (12 mL) at 0 °C in a flask wrapped in 
foil. The cooling bath was removed after 1 h, and the reaction was stirred for an additional 4 
h, whereupon the mixture was cooled to 0 °C and methanolic HCl (2.0 M, 5 mL) added. 
After stirring for 5 min, the volatiles were removed under reduced pressure, 2 N HCl(aq) (20 
mL) was added, and the aqueous mixture was extracted with Et2O (2 × 15 mL). The pH of 
the aqueous layer was adjusted to ~9 by the slow addition of 2.2 M NaOH(aq) and then 
extracted with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL). The combined organic extracts were dried (Na2SO4) 
and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford 155 mg (79%) of the secondary amine 
intermediate, which was of sufficient purity (>95% LC and 1H NMR) to be used in the next 
step without purification. Paraformaldehyde (S6, 66 mg, 2.2 mmol) was added to a solution 
of secondary amine (28 mg, 0.11 mmol) in DCE (1 mL) followed by the addition of sodium 
triacetoxyborohydride (117 mg, 0.55 mmol) and acetic acid (10.5 μL, 0.18 mmol). The 
mixture was stirred for 24 h and then quenched by the addition of 2.2 M NaOH(aq) (~1 mL) 
and H2O (~2 mL). After stirring for 5 more min, the layers were separated, H2O was added 
to the aqueous mixture (~2 mL) followed by extraction with CH2Cl2 (3 × 20 mL). Brine was 
added to the aqueous mixture, which was then extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 20 mL). The 
combined organic extracts were dried (MgSO4), filtered, and concentrated under reduced 
pressure to give the N-methylamine, which was purified via flash column chromatography

 Sigma Receptor Binding Assay Protocol
Receptor binding assays were performed by the Psychoactive Drug Screening Program 
(PDSP) at Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The assay protocol book can be accessed free of 
charge at: https://pdspdb.unc.edu/pdspWeb/content/PDSP%20Protocols%20II
%202013-03-28.pdf. Briefly, σ1R were sourced from guinea pig brain and Sig1R binding 
affinity (Ki) was determined through competition binding assays with [3H]-(+)-pentazocine. 
σ2R were obtained from rat PC12 cells, and the Sig2R ligand binding affinity (Ki) was 
determined through competition binding assays using the radioligand [3H]-ditolylguanidine 
in the presence of (+)-pentazocine to block σ1R binding sites. Ki values are calculated from 
best-fit IC50 determinations and are the average of two or more independent runs performed 
in triplicate.
Sample Preparation for in Vivo Use
Dry compounds were reconstituted in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to a stock concentration 
between 25 and 100 mM and then diluted down to 10 μg total drug in a volume of 5 μL for 
IT injections. The total amount of DMSO for IT injections was always less than 5%, and the 
vehicle injections always contained the same amount of DMSO. Siramesine (Tocris) sample 
was reconstituted and diluted in the same way. Samples were diluted in the same manner for 
IV injections.
Gene Expression Analysis
Transcripts per million (TPM) was used to quantify relative gene abundance. Fragments per 
kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKMs) for coding genes were obtained by 
running the Tophat/Cuffdiff57 pipeline or from published data. These were then normalized 
to sum to 1 million in order to generate TPMs. For mouse single cell RNA-seq data sets, low 
sequencing depth makes TPMs inaccurate due to high sampling variation, and the fraction of 
cells with presence of sequenced reads from genes of interest for different cell types are 
presented instead.
Statistics
Data are shown as mean ± standard error of the mean, and the number of animals or samples 
used in each analysis are shown in figure legends. GraphPad Prism 7 for Mac OSX was used 
to analyze data. Two-way ANOVAs were used to analyze von Frey data with Bonferroni’s 
multiple comparison post hoc test. Two tailed t tests were used to analyze rotorod data. 
Significance level was at α < 0.05.
