INTRODUCTION: Recently, a special class of
RNAs has excited researchers and triggered
hundreds of now-published studies. Known as
circular RNAs (circRNAs), these RNAs are pro-
duced by regular transcription from genomic
DNA, but the two ends of the (usually) exonic
transcripts are covalently closed, probably in
most cases by noncanonical splice reactions.
Most circRNAs are expressed in the cytoplasm
and are unusually stable, suggesting that they
may have functions that diverge from those of
canonical messenger RNAs (mRNAs) or long
noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs).
CircRNAs tend to be weakly expressed, but
there are exceptions in animal brains. For
example, in the mouse brain, a few hundred
circRNAs are highly expressed, often with de-
velopmentally specific expression patterns that
are conserved in the human brain. We previous-
ly proposed that circRNAs may, at least some-
times, serve as regulatory RNAs. A circRNA
discovered by the Kjems laboratory, CDR1as,
caught our attention because it was covered
with >70 binding sites for the microRNA
(miRNA) miR-7. Our data suggested that
CDR1as might serve to alter the free concen-
tration of miR-7. But what really is the func-
tion of CDR1as?
RATIONALE: We first determined which
miRNAs specifically bind Cdr1as in postmor-
tem human and mouse brains and charac-
terized Cdr1as expression patterns. Once we
had that information, we removed Cdr1as
from the mouse genome to study the molec-
ular and behavioral consequences.
RESULTS:We show that Cdr1as is, in the human
brain, directly and massively bound by miR-7
and miR-671. In fact, Cdr1as is one of the most
common transcripts targeted by miRNAs out of
all brain mRNAs or lncRNAs. The expression of
miRNAs was generally unperturbed in Cdr1as
knockout (KO) mice, with the exception of
the two miRNAs that di-
rectly interact with Cdr1as,
miR-7 and miR-671, which
were respectively down-
regulated and up-regulated.
This perturbation was post-
transcriptional, consistent
with a model in which Cdr1as interacts with
these miRNAs in the cytoplasm. We show that
Cdr1as is highly expressed (hundreds of copies
within neurons) in somas and neurites, but not
in glial cells.
The expression of many immediate early genes
(IEGs), which are markers of neuronal activity,
was consistently up-regulated in KO animals.
For example, c-Fos and a few other miR-7 tar-
gets were up-regulated, suggesting that IEG up-
regulation can in part be explained by miR-7
down-regulation and that Cdr1as modulates
neuronal activity. Cdr1as KO mice showed a
strong deficit in prepulse inhibition of the
startle response, a sensorimotor gating phe-
notype that is impaired in several human neu-
ropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological
measurements indicated an increase in spon-
taneous vesicle release in Cdr1as KO neurons,
suggesting that Cdr1as plays a role in regulat-
ing synaptic transmission.
CONCLUSION: Mechanistically, our data indi-
cate that Cdr1as regulates miR-7 stability or
transport in neurons, whereas miR-671 regu-
lates Cdr1as levels. Functionally, our data sug-
gest that Cdr1as and its direct interactions
with miRNAs are important for sensorimotor
gating and synaptic transmission. More gener-
ally, because the brain is an organ with excep-
tionally high and diverse expression of circRNAs,
our data suggest the existence of a previously
unknown layer of biological functions carried
out by circRNAs.▪

Cdr1as is a brain-enriched circular RNA, expressed in hundreds of copies within neurons
and essential for maintaining normal brain function. Genetic ablation of the Cdr1as locus in
mice led to deregulation of miR-7 and miR-671 in the brain, up-regulation of immediate early
genes, synaptic malfunctions, and a deficit in prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex, a behavioral
phenotype associated with neuropsychiatric disorders.

Hundreds of circular RNAs (circRNAs) are highly abundant in the mammalian brain, often
with conserved expression. Here we show that the circRNA Cdr1as is massively bound
by the microRNAs (miRNAs) miR-7 and miR-671 in human and mouse brains. When the
Cdr1as locus was removed from the mouse genome, knockout animals displayed impaired
sensorimotor gating—a deficit in the ability to filter out unnecessary information—which
is associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. Electrophysiological recordings revealed
dysfunctional synaptic transmission. Expression of miR-7 and miR-671 was specifically and
posttranscriptionally misregulated in all brain regions analyzed. Expression of immediate
early genes such as Fos, a direct miR-7 target, was enhanced in Cdr1as-deficient brains,
providing a possible molecular link to the behavioral phenotype. Our data indicate an
in vivo loss-of-function circRNA phenotype and suggest that interactions between Cdr1as
and miRNAs are important for normal brain function.
I
n recent years, it has been shown that ani-
mals express large numbers of single-stranded
RNA molecules that are covalently closed at
the 5′ and 3′ ends, known as circular RNAs
(circRNAs) (1–3). All mammalian circRNAs
studied to date are consequences of “backsplic-
ing,” in which the spliceosome joins the 3′ end
of an exon with an upstream 5′ end of the same
or different exons from the same transcript (4–6).
Backsplicing is context-dependent (4, 7), and
circRNAs are often tissue- and developmental
stage–specifically expressed (3). In mammals,
a few hundred circRNAs are highly expressed
in major brain areas, with frequently conserved
expression between humans and mice (7). In
neurons, circRNAs are expressed in the soma
and neurites and have the overall highest con-
centration at synaptosomes (7, 8). Probably be-
cause of the absence of 5′ and 3′ ends, circRNAs
have half-lives ranging from hours to days or
longer and are therefore generally much more
stable than linear coding or noncoding messages
(3). Thus, circRNAs may carry out biological func-
tions that differ from those of other classes of
RNAs; however, their normal functions are large-
ly unknown.
Cdr1as is a circularized long noncoding RNA
(lncRNA) that is highly abundant in the mam-
malian brain and expressed at low levels or ab-
sent in other tissues and organs. It is highly
conserved across mammals and not detectable
as a linear transcript (3, 9, 10). Human CDR1as,
which is mainly located in the cytoplasm, has
more than 70 binding sites for the microRNA
(miRNA) miR-7 (3, 9), which is involved in reg-
ulation of a number of genes in the brain (11–13).
Binding of miR-7 to CDR1as has been shown in
cell lines, and, consequently, CDR1as has been
proposed to function as a sponge for miR-7 by
reducing the number of freely available miR-7
molecules (3, 9). The miR-7 binding sites are only
partially complementary to miR-7, ensuring that
Cdr1as is not sliced by AGO2 bound to miR-7:
Cdr1as complexes. Cdr1as also has a binding site
for miR-671 (10). This binding site, in contrast to
those for miR-7, has almost full complementar-
ity to miR-671 and therefore may be used by
miR-671 to mediate slicing of Cdr1as (10), po-
tentially to release its miR-7 cargo. However, the
normal in vivo function of Cdr1as has yet to be
determined.
Cdr1as binding by miR-7 and miR-671 in
the mammalian brain
To identify miRNAs that bind Cdr1as in the
mammalian brain, we utilized the recent find-
ing that after RNA:protein purification of the
miRNA effector AGO via cross-linking and im-
munoprecipitation (CLIP) assays, the 3′ end of
miRNAs can be ligated to the 5′ end of their RNA
target sites. After sequencing, these so-called
“chimeras” allow unambiguous in vivo detection
of miRNA target sites, as well as, simultaneously,
the identification of the individual miRNAs bound
to them (14). Using our computational pipeline
for chimera detection (14), we identified and
mapped tens of thousands of chimeras in re-
cently published AGO CLIP data from mouse
and human postmortem brains (15, 16). When
ranking these transcripts by the number of miR-7
chimeras mapping to an individual transcript,
the top-scoring target of all transcripts in both
human and mouse brains was Cdr1as (Fig. 1A
and table S1). Only one other miRNA was highly
bound to Cdr1as, miR-671 (Fig. 1A). However, in
contrast to miR-7, for which we detected many
distinct binding sites on Cdr1as, we detected only
one main binding site for miR-671 (Fig. 1A and
table S1). The architectures of the miR-7 and
miR-671 binding sites are also very different.
Whereas miR-7 binding sites feature complemen-
tarity only to the 5′ end (“seed” region, which is
essential for binding of miRNA to mRNA) of
miR-7, the miR-671 binding site is almost per-
fectly complementary to the entire mature miR-671
sequence (fig. S1). Therefore, miR-671 can mediate
slicing of Cdr1as, whereas miR-7 cannot. These
binding site architectures are perfectly conserved
in mammalian evolution (fig. S1), indicating that
they are linked to the function of Cdr1as.
In our chimera analysis, the lncRNA Cyrano
(1700020I14Rik) was identified as the second-
highest-ranked RNA interacting with miR-7 in
the mouse brain (table S1). Cyrano harbors a sin-
gle, nearly perfectly complementary and highly
conserved binding site for miR-7 (17). These
observations imply that, second to Cdr1as, Cyrano
may play an important role in the regulation of
miR-7 in the central nervous system.
Neural expression pattern of Cdr1as
To determine Cdr1as expression patterns in the
mouse brain, we performed RNA fluorescence
in situ hybridization (FISH) in adult brain sec-
tions (Fig. 1B and figs. S2 to S4). Costaining with
neural markers revealed that Cdr1as was highly
expressed in neurons but not expressed in glial
cells such as oligodendrocytes and astrocytes
(Fig. 1B and fig. S3D). Further, an overlap with
excitatory and inhibitory neuronal markers
showed that Cdr1as was predominantly ex-
pressed in excitatory neurons (Fig. 1, B and C,
and figs. S2 to S4). In the cortex, hippocampus,
midbrain, and hindbrain, the majority of neurons
expressing Cdr1as were VGLUT1- and VGLUT2-
positive (figs. S2, B to E; S3, A to C; and S4,

 B and D). In the cerebellum, Cdr1as expression
was observed exclusively in the granular layer
with a high content of excitatory neurons and
did not overlap with GABAergic neurons pres-
ent in the molecular layer and Purkinje cells
(fig. S4D; GABA, g-aminobutyric acid). Single-
molecule RNA FISH in primary cortical neurons
revealed Cdr1as expression in both soma and
neurites (Fig. 1C, left), indicating a possible func-
tional role of Cdr1as in different subcellular
localizations.
Cdr1as loss-of-function mutant mice
Because Cdr1as is so efficiently circularized in hu-
man and mouse cells that it cannot be detected
as a linear transcript (3, 9, 10), the most straight-
forward strategy to create a loss-of-function (LoF)
mouse model for this circRNA is to remove the
Cdr1as locus by using CRISPR-Cas9. However,
this strategy could also affect transcription on the
other strand and therefore complicate the inter-
pretation. To evaluate expression from the other
strand, we created and sequenced 24 stranded
RNA libraries (i.e., retaining the strand-of-origin
information in the RNA sequencing library) from
four mouse brain regions, performed in situ hy-
bridization (ISH) with a probe complementary to
the putative sense transcript (Cdr1 mRNA), and
analyzed published RNA sequencing, cap analy-
sis of gene expression, and chromatin modifi-
cation data (fig. S5). We failed to detect any
evidence for transcription of the strand opposite
to Cdr1as in mouse brains, specific mouse brain
regions, or any other mouse or human tissue
analyzed. We therefore removed the Cdr1as locus
(Fig. 1D) from the mouse genome, as shown by
genotyping (fig. S6, A and B), ISH (Fig. 1D and
fig. S6C), Northern blot analysis (fig. S6D), and
quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays (fig. S7A). Cdr1as
knockout (KO) mice were viable and fertile and
displayed no gross abnormality in adult brain
anatomy (fig. S6E).
Because Cdr1as is X-linked, before analysis of
KO animals, we investigated Cdr1as expression
in wild-type (WT) male and female and heter-
ozygous (Cdr1as+/−) female brains. qRT-PCR assays
showed that Cdr1as expression in male and fe-
male WT mice was about equal, whereas in heter-
ozygous female mice, Cdr1as levels were reduced
by ~50% relative to the WT levels (fig. S7B). Be-
cause there were no differences in Cdr1as ex-
pression levels between WT males and females,
we used hemizygous (Cdr1as–/Y) male mice for
further molecular analysis.
miR-7 and miR-671 are posttranscriptionally
deregulated in Cdr1as KO brains
We sequenced miRNAs in four major brain re-
gions (cerebellum, cortex, hippocampus, and ol-
factory bulb) where Cdr1as is highly expressed
(7). Northern blot analysis was also used to de-
tect miR-7 in assayed tissues (fig. S8). When
comparing expression levels from our sequenc-
ing data in WT and KO animals, miR-7 was
consistently and markedly down-regulated (Fig.
2 and statistics in table S2). More precisely, both
miR-7a-5p and miR-7b-5p, which have the same
seed but slightly different mature sequences and
are produced from three different miR-7 loci in
the genome, were down-regulated to comparable
levels in all cases. This down-regulation was high-
ly specific. From hundreds of identified miRNAs,
only eight miRNAs other than miR-7a-5p and
miR-7b-5p were significantly down-regulated,

 and this occurred only in the cortex (Fig. 2B).
All of these miRNAs belong to two families and
are derived from three primary transcripts (miR-
200c/141, miR-200a/200b/429, and miR-182/183/
96). We confirmed miR-7 down-regulation in all
four brain regions by Northern blot (Fig. 3A and
fig. S9), ISH (Fig. 3, B and C), and qRT-PCR assays
(fig. S7C). In addition, miR-7 down-regulation was
posttranscriptional. This finding is supported by
the sequencing data showing that none of the
three miR-7 passenger strands (miR-7a-1-3p, miR-
7a-2-3p, and miR-7b-3p), which are respectively
processed from the three distinct miR-7 precur-
sors, were significantly deregulated (Fig. 2). This
observation was validated by Northern blot (fig.
S9A) and an independent qRT-PCR assay for
pre–miR-7a-1 (fig. S7D). Pre–miR-7a-2 and pre–
miR-7b were below reliable detection levels in
qRT-PCR analysis. The down-regulated expression
of miRNAs from miR-200 and miR-183 families
in the cortex was probably the result of a tran-
scriptional effect, given that the corresponding
passenger strands were also down-regulated (Fig.
2B). Unlike miR-7 expression, miR-671-5p expres-
sion in KO animals was up-regulated in the cer-
ebellum, cortex, and olfactory bulb (Fig. 2, A, B,
and D). But as with miR-7, this deregulation in
KO mice was highly specific: Aside from miR-671,
no other miRNA was consistently up-regulated.
Also like miR-7, miR-671-5p was deregulated post-
transcriptionally, as evidenced by unperturbed
passenger strand expression (Fig. 2, A, B, and D).
Northern blot analysis failed to detect mature
miR-671-5p in either KO or WT RNA extracts, al-
though miR-671-3p was detectable and remained
unaltered (fig. S9A). Two reasons may explain
why miR-671-5p and its precursor are difficult to
detect: (i) Mature miR-671 is lowly expressed
and unstable, as shown in metabolic labeling ex-
periments (18), and (ii) the precursor is processed
from the coding sequence of the well-expressed
Chpf2 transcript.
We analyzed Cdr1as, miR-7, and miR-671 levels
in nonbrain tissues including lung, skeletal mus-
cle, spleen, heart, and spinal cord (fig. S7, A, C,
and E). In the spleen, where Cdr1as was un-
detectable but miR-7a was well-expressed, and
in other tissues exhibiting very low expression
of Cdr1as, miR-7a levels were not changed by
Cdr1as removal. The only nonbrain tissue with
substantially changed miR-7 expression was spi-
nal cord. This was also the only nonbrain tissue
for which we detected reasonable expression of
Cdr1as, consistent with the expression of Cdr1as
in neurons and neuronal projections.
Taken together, these data show that loss of
Cdr1as does not affect miR-7 and miR-671 in tis-
sues outside the brain that normally exhibit very
low levels of Cdr1as RNA, whereas Cdr1as loss
drives down-regulation of miR-7 in neural tis-
sues of KO animals. We conclude that there is a
highly specific, posttranscriptional deregulation
of miR-7 and miR-671 in the brains of Cdr1as
KO animals. These are the two miRNAs that we
identified by in vivo chimera analysis as directly
interacting with Cdr1as.
Up-regulation of immediate early genes,
including miR-7 targets, in Cdr1as
KO brains
To assess the functional consequences of Cdr1as
removal, we measured changes in mRNA ex-
pression by sequencing mRNAs in the same
brain regions in which we observed miR-7 and
miR-671 deregulation: the cerebellum, cortex,
hippocampus, and olfactory bulb (Fig. 4, A to
D, and table S3). Conserved miR-7 targets (19)
were significantly up-regulated in the cortex,
cerebellum, and olfactory bulb (Mann-Whitney
U test; P < 10−4, 10−3, and 10−7, respectively) (fig.
S10), including several validated miR-7 targets,
such as Fos (which has three conserved binding
sites in its 3′ untranslated region) (20), Nr4a3
(21), Irs2 (22), and Klf4 (23) (Fig. 4, A to D; fig.
S11; and statistics in tables S3 and S4). The
lncRNA Cyrano—which interacts with miR-7 in
the brain, as supported by Cyrano:miR-7 chime-
ras (table S1)—was highly expressed and stable
in all analyzed brain regions of Cdr1as KO ani-
mals. Furthermore, among the genes that were
up-regulated in each of the four brain regions,
we found an obvious and highly significant over-
representation (hypergeometric test; P < 10−33)
of immediate early genes (IEGs), such as Fos,
Arc, Egr1, Egr2, Nr4a3, and others, which are
part of the first wave of response to different
stimuli and markers of neuronal activity (Fig.
4, A to D; fig. S11; and tables S3 and S4). We
validated the sequencing data by qRT-PCR assays
(fig. S12) and Nanostring (fig. S13A and table S5),
using the cortex and hippocampus from the
same and independent animals. We confirmed
an increased expression of IEGs at the protein
level for all tested candidates. Elevated levels of
c-Fos, EGR1, and ARC were detected by Western
blots (Fig. 4E) and by further immunohisto-
chemical validation of c-Fos and EGR1 proteins
in brain sections (Fig. 4F and figs. S14 to S16).
Quantification of c-Fos immunostaining per-
formed in four cortical regions showed a con-
sistent increase in both the number of neurons
expressing c-Fos and the c-Fos signal intensity
in KO brains (fig. S15). These data are impor-
tant for two reasons. First, miR-7 is a known
repressor of the cell cycle and IEGs such as Fos,
suggesting a direct link between Cdr1as removal
and up-regulation of IEGs. Second, up-regulation
of IEGs is strongly linked to increased activity
of neurons (24–26). Therefore, we conclude that

 the reduction of miR-7 followed by enhanced
expression of IEGs implies higher neuronal ac-
tivity in Cdr1as KO brains, and we hypothesized
that this effect has further functional conse-
quences at the phenotypic level.
Consistent with the expression pattern of
Cdr1as, the expression levels of IEGs in non-
brain tissues of KO animals remained unaltered
(fig. S13, B to E), suggesting that the observed
effect is brain-specific. We also observed that,
in addition to IEGs, there were several dif-
ferentially expressed circadian clock genes in
Cdr1as KO brains. Per1 and Sik1 were con-
sistently up-regulated, and Dbp was consistently
down-regulated (Fig. 4, A to D). This expression
pattern in the forebrain has previously been
associated with sleep deprivation and extended
wakefulness in mice (27, 28).
Dysfunction of excitatory synaptic
transmission in Cdr1as KO mice
Given that Cdr1as is predominantly expressed
in excitatory neurons (Fig. 1, B and C, and figs.
S2 to S4), we wanted to elucidate the physiolog-
ical consequences of removing Cdr1as at the syn-
aptic level. Therefore, we used single hippocampal
neurons and studied excitatory postsynaptic cur-
rents (EPSCs). We found that spontaneous ves-
icle release was strongly up-regulated in the KO
neurons, with more than a doubling of minia-
ture EPSC frequency (Fig. 5A) but not amplitude
(fig. S17A). By analyzing calcium-evoked synap-
tic responses, we found that the EPSC amplitude
of Cdr1as KO neurons was not significantly dif-
ferent from that of WT neurons (Fig. 5B, left).
The observed effect of higher spontaneous re-
lease was not dependent on synapse formation
or vesicle priming activity, because the size of the
readily releasable vesicle pool was not signifi-
cantly altered (fig. S17B). Although the computed
vesicular release probability also was not signif-
icantly altered (fig. S17B), responses to two con-
secutive stimuli (Fig. 5B, right) and to a train of
action potentials at 10 Hz were differentially mod-
ulated in the KO and WT neurons (fig. S17C). This
suggests altered vesicle replenishment dynamics
during ongoing synaptic release activity and
stronger depression in the synaptic response in
the KO neurons.
These electrophysiological recordings indicate
that Cdr1as deficiency leads to a dysfunction of
excitatory synaptic transmission. Possible mech-
anisms that could explain this change include
changes in expression of synaptic proteins (29),
malformation of synaptic specialization, or al-
teration in synaptic calcium homeostasis (30).
Neuropsychiatric-like alteration in the
behavior of Cdr1as KO mice
To further evaluate the biological implications
of miRNA and IEG deregulation in Cdr1as KO
brains, we performed behavioral assays with WT
and Cdr1as KO animals (Fig. 5C, fig. S18, and
table S6). Cdr1as KO mice showed normal social
behavior, unaffected anxiety levels, unperturbed
locomotor activity in an open field test, and no
significant deficits in recognition memory or ex-
ploratory behavior (fig. S18, B to H). However, a
test of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle
response revealed a significant and strong dif-
ference (30 to 50%) between WT and Cdr1as KO
mice (both males and females) at all three pre-
pulse intensities (Fig. 5C). PPI is used to detect
defects in the normal suppression of the startle
response that occurs when a startle-eliciting
stimulus is preceded by a low-intensity prestimu-
lus (the prepulse). It is a measure of sensorimotor
gating that is impaired in schizophrenia and
some other psychiatric diseases in humans and
used in animal models of endophenotypes related
to neuropsychiatric disorders (31–34). The impair-
ment was evident and specific for the inhibition of
the startle response. The baseline response to the
pulse only (120 dB) was similar across genotypes
and groups (fig. S18A). Therefore, the PPI deficien-
cy is not due to differences in the response to an
acoustic stimulus or due to hearing impairments.
Thus, our data show that Cdr1as KO animals
exhibit a behavioral phenotype associated with
neuropsychiatric disorders—namely, a strong
sensorimotor gating deficit. Our findings sup-
port the general observation that up-regulation
of IEGs such as Fos, Egr1, and Egr4 is linked to
reduced PPI (35).
Discussion
In this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 to remove
the locus encoding Cdr1as, a circRNA that is
highly expressed in neurons and predominantly
localized to the cytoplasm. In all tested in vivo
mammalian tissues and cell lines, Cdr1as was
detected only as a circRNA (3, 9, 10). We failed,
by different assays, to detect any transcription on
the strand antisense to Cdr1as, making it un-
likely that removal of the Cdr1as locus has con-
sequences beyond removing the circRNA. We
cannot rule out CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects
or other unspecific consequences for the locus,
but these (if existent) are unlikely to have con-
tributed to the molecular and behavioral pheno-
type that we observed in the KO animals. This
is because (i) we show that precisely the two
miRNAs (miR-7 and miR-671) that we found to
specifically interact with Cdr1as in the brain
are deregulated in the KO animals; (ii) IEGs,
including direct targets of miR-7, are up-regulated
in the mutant brains but not in other tissues
where Cdr1as is very lowly or not expressed;
(iii) IEGs are already known to be linked to the
observed neuropsychiatric symptom, impaired
prepulse inhibition (PPI) (35); and (iv) Cdr1as
is exclusively expressed in neurons but not glial
cells, suggesting that Cdr1as interactions with
miRNAs are functional in neurons, in line with
the observed deficit in PPI and dysfunction in
synaptic transmission.
How can we explain the specific and opposite
deregulation of miR-7 and miR-671 upon loss of
Cdr1as? The reason may lie in the very different
and highly conserved architectures of the bind-
ing sites of miR-7 and miR-671 on Cdr1as. None
of the >70 miR-7 binding sites has extensive
complementarity beyond the seed region, indi-
cating that miR-7 stably binds but cannot slice
Cdr1as. In contrast, miR-671 has one main bind-
ing site with almost perfect complementarity,
which should lead to slicing of Cdr1as (10) and
may cause tailing and trimming (removal) of
miR-671 (36, 37). Thus, upon depletion of Cdr1as,
we would expect up-regulation of miR-671 and
down-regulation of miR-7, which is no longer
stabilized by Cdr1as.
Is miR-7 turnover upon Cdr1as KO a passive
decay process, or is it regulated? We speculate
that miR-7 decay is promoted and regulated by
the lncRNA Cyrano (17). This is because (i) we
found Cyrano to be the second-highest miR-7

 interactor in chimeric data (table S1); (ii) Cyrano
was highly expressed in all tissues in which we
detected Cdr1as expression (Fig. 4, A to D); and
(iii) the miR-7 binding site on Cyrano is unusual
in that it has an extremely well conserved ar-
chitecture that, similar to the miR-671 binding
site on Cdr1as, could promote miR-7 removal by
tailing and trimming (17, 36, 37).
When comparing mRNA expression between
WT and KO animals, we found an enrichment
of up-regulated IEGs, some of which, such as
Fos and Nr4a3, are known miR-7 targets. Up-
regulation of predicted miR-7 targets was sta-
tistically significant, consistent with the observed
reduction of miR-7. The known miR-7 targets
Klf4, Nr4a3, and Irs2, which were increased in
KO postnatal cortex, were also up-regulated in
a miR-7 knockdown study performed in the em-
bryonic cortex (13). However, miR-7 targets did
not explain the majority of up-regulation, indi-
cating that we observed a mixture of direct and
indirect effects. We also observed different over-
all responses of miR-7 targets in the mouse brain
upon constitutive Cdr1as knockout, compared
with results from knockdown experiments in hu-
man embryonic kidney–293 cells, in which tar-
gets of miR-7 were repressed (3). We argue that
there are different scenarios for what may hap-
pen to miR-7 bound to Cdr1as if Cdr1as is re-
moved from a cellular system conditionally versus
constitutively. A scenario in which miR-7:RISC
complexes could be released and subsequently
down-regulate miR-7 targets may be more plau-
sible when Cdr1as is conditionally knocked down.
In a situation in which Cdr1as is constitutively
knocked out, miR-7 molecules not stabilized by
the circRNA may be more likely to be turned over.
Thus, miR-7 targets can be up-regulated. Addi-
tionally, the widespread distribution of Cdr1as
in neuronal processes argues for a functional
role of Cdr1as in the transport of miR-7:AGO
complexes and provides another layer of com-
plexity to the regulation of miR-7 targets, which
could be differential in various subcellular lo-
calizations. miR-671 therefore may provide an
“unlocking” mechanism that serves to slice
Cdr1as under specific conditions within the cell
to release the cargo (sponged miR-7:AGO com-
plexes). It will be interesting to test these hy-
potheses, but the lack of suitable in vitro systems,
the technical difficulties in performing efficient
and conditional overexpression or knockdown
of Cdr1as, and the complex phenotypes observ-
ed will likely require the generation of many
transgenic cell and mouse lines. In any case,
activation of IEGs has been linked to increased
neuronal activity, which can be induced by both
cell-extrinsic and cell-intrinsic signals (38, 39)
and has further functional consequences—for
example, in synaptic plasticity and memory
formation (40).
In behavioral tests, Cdr1as KO animals dis-
played significant and strong PPI impairment,
a neuropsychiatric phenotype. A deficit in PPI
manifests as the inability to effectively attenu-
ate the intrinsic startle response to redundant
stimuli. PPI deficit correlates clinically with symp-
toms such as thought disorder and distractibility
in schizophrenia; therefore, PPI has emerged as
a promising endophenotype in human and ro-
dent models of the disease (31, 33, 41). Reduced
PPI is also a hallmark of other neuropsychiatric
disorders, including obsessive-compulsive dis-
order, bipolar disorder, Tourette syndrome, post-
traumatic stress disorder, Huntington’s disease,
and Asperger syndrome (34, 42). PPI is a complex
phenotype that involves diverse neural systems

 encompassing the brainstem, pedunculopontine,
hippocampus, amygdala, and prefrontal cortical
regions, as well as different neurochemical sub-
strates including dopamine, glutamate, and GABA
(43). According to our analysis, Cdr1as is expressed
in most excitatory neurons. After removing the
Cdr1as locus, we observed a disrupted excitatory
neurotransmission reflected as an increased spon-
taneous vesicle release and stronger depression in
synaptic response upon enhanced neuronal activ-
ity in KO neurons. It is interesting that miR-7 has
been described as a negative regulator of vesicle
release in pancreatic b cells (44). Our findings
suggest that loss of Cdr1as destabilizes mature
miR-7 in neurons, which results in de-repression
of IEGs and leads to altered neuronal activity,
which may cause the sensorimotor deficits and
the neuropsychiatric phenotype. In addition to
miR-7, miR-200 was also strongly deregulated
in the cortex and may contribute to the observed
phenotype. Given the broad expression of Cdr1as
in the brain and the diversity of the neural sys-
tems recruited in PPI, these hypotheses need
thorough testing.
We focused on behavior and synaptic func-
tions. However, we noticed that genes specifically
for circadian clock regulation were consistently
deregulated in KO brains. Moreover, deregulation
of miR-7, miR-671, the miR-200 family, and IEGs
is associated with cancer, which will be impor-
tant to consider in cancer models in the future.
Methods summary
Cdr1as KO animals were generated using CRISPR-
Cas9 via microinjection of one-cell embryos with
Cas9 mRNA and two single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs)
designed to bind upstream of Cdr1as splice sites.
The Cdr1as KO strain was generated and main-
tained on the pure C57BL/6N background. Mo-
lecular and electrophysiological analyses were
performed using KO animals and littermate WT
control animals. Behavioral studies were per-
formed using Cdr1as KO animals and littermate
or age-matched WT control animals. The ex-
perimental procedures were approved by the
Landesamt für Gesundheit und Soziales (Berlin,
Germany).
ISH and immunostainings were performed
on fresh frozen brain sections, using locked
nucleic acid probes, RNAs obtained by in vitro
transcription on PCR products, or commercially
available antibodies. Whole-cell voltage-clamp
recordings were obtained from Cdr1as KO and
WT hippocampal autaptic neurons at day 14 to
17 in vitro. cDNA libraries for RNA sequencing
were generated according to the Illumina TruSeq
protocols and sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq
500 system. Differential gene and miRNA expres-
sion analyses were performed using the DESeq2
package. RNA:miRNA chimeric reads were ana-
lyzed using previously published AGO HITS-CLIP
(high-throughput sequencing of RNA isolated by
CLIP) data (15, 16) and an in-house pipeline based
on (14). The details of experimental procedures,
reagents, and computational analyses, including
supporting references, are given in the mate-
rials and methods section of the supplemen-
tary materials.
