Abstract
Background: People bereaved by suicide are at increased risk of suicide attempt and suicide, but explanations for these
associations remain theoretical. It is possible that the experience of suicide bereavement modifies personal attitudes
towards suicide, but the nature of these changes remains unexplored. There is a need to understand personal attitudes
to suicide following suicide bereavement, as this may inform the development of suicide prevention interventions. Our
aim was to explore the attitudes of young adults bereaved by suicide towards their own likelihood of dying by suicide.
Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of staff and students aged 18–40 at 37 United Kingdom (UK) higher
educational institutions in 2010. Ethical approval was granted by the UCL Research Ethics Committee. Qualitative
responses to a question probing attitudes to own suicide were provided by 429 respondents who had experienced
bereavement by the suicide of a close contact. We identified key themes in this dataset using thematic analysis.
Results: Analysis identified four main themes: suicide as a more tangible option (whether feared or not); identification
with the deceased and awareness of shared vulnerabilities to suicide; personal determination to avoid suicide; and
beliefs regarding safeguards against suicide. These themes reflected a broad split in participants' views regarding own
likelihood of dying by suicide, influenced by the degree to which own suicide was feared and the extent to which they
felt in control of determining a suicide death. Whilst the majority described an aversion to the idea of attempting suicide
themselves, largely through an awareness of the impact on others, a minority described their experiences as having
normalised suicide as a personal option.
Conclusions: The views of a sample of UK-based adults bereaved by suicide suggest that exposure to the suicide of a
close friend or relative can influence attitudes to suicide in ways that could influence own risk of suicide attempt. The
normalising attitudes to suicide observed in a minority of respondents could contribute to the observed association
between suicide bereavement and suicide attempt.

 Background
For every suicide it is estimated that ten relatives or
friends are deeply affected by the death [1]. These be-
reaved individuals have an increased risk of suicide [2]
and suicide attempt [3], with one in ten people reporting
having attempted suicide after the suicide of a close con-
tact [3]. With over 800,000 people dying by suicide
worldwide annually [4], evidence suggests that the past
year prevalence of exposure to suicide bereavement is
4%, with a lifetime prevalence of 22% [5]. Most suicide
prevention strategies highlight the need to provide sup-
port to this group [6–9] but there is weak evidence for
interventions to improve their health outcomes [10] and
a perceived lack of informal support [11]. A key barrier
to developing effective interventions is the lack of under-
standing of the mechanisms of suicidality after suicide be-
reavement. It is critical to develop and test theories about
potential explanatory factors, in order to design interven-
tions to address modifiable risk factors. These can then be
trialled for their effectiveness in reducing the risk of sui-
cide and improving wider health outcomes for this group.
Our earlier systematic review described the increased risk
of suicide, psychiatric admission, and depression in people
bereaved by suicide [2]. We also suggested various expla-
nations for the association between suicide bereavement
and suicide attempt, based on the literature and clinical
observation [2]. These included: the psychological trauma
of a suicide loss; shared familial or environmental vulner-
abilities to mental illness and suicidality; the influence of
stigma [12] on help-seeking; and suicide suggestion [13].
The last of these describes the impact of a role model’s
suicide or suicide attempt on a person’s internal con-
straints against self-harm, [14] whether due to social
learning, imitation or emotional contagion [13]. The
phenomenon is described by a number of terms, none of
which satisfactorily describe the phenomenon, but in-
clude; imitative suicide, [14] suicide contagion [15], or sui-
cide diffusion [16]. Gaining an understanding of this
phenomenon is the focus of the current study.
Personal attitudes to suicide are theorised to play a
key role in forming suicidal ideas [14]. Despite the
possibility of residual confounding due to shared so-
cial adversity and/or assortative homophily, [14] there
is evidence to support the effect of suicide suggestion
after exposure to a peer’s fatal or non-fatal suicide at-
tempt [17, 18]. Young people are thought to be particu-
larly susceptible to emulating suicidal behaviour of their
peers [19], and this is thought to explain a number of
well-publicised suicide clusters [20, 21]. There is also evi-
dence that young people are more likely than their elders
to hold accepting views towards suicide [22], regarding it
as a means of expressing despair [23]. Adolescents and
young adults who most strongly believe that it is accept-
able to end one’s life are more likely to make a suicide
plan than those who do not have such beliefs [24]. Longi-
tudinal analyses of US data find that adolescents’ exposure
to the suicide attempt of a friend or relative can trigger
new suicidal thoughts and attempts [13, 25], particularly
in girls [13], and after a friend’s suicide attempt [13], but
that these effects fade with time [13]. They also identify a
triggering effect of exposure to suicidal behaviour in a
peer’s family member [26]. However, no British studies
have described attitudes to suicide after suicide bereave-
ment, despite this group featuring prominently in the sui-
cide prevention strategies for England [7], Wales [8] and
Northern Ireland [9]. Our objective was to explore the
views of a large United Kingdom (UK) -based sample of
young adults on whether their experiences of suicide be-
reavement had shaped their attitudes to suicide.
We
conducted
a national mixed methods cross-
sectional study with the overarching objective of describ-
ing the impact of suicide bereavement on clinical and
occupational outcomes in young adults. We chose to
focus on young adults as an under-researched group,
reflecting concerns about their vulnerabilities to suicide
and social modelling of suicidal behaviour [27], their
tendency to avoid accessing mental health services
[28], and their priority status within UK suicide pre-
vention strategies [6–9]. To access a large community
sample of young adults, otherwise under-represented
in health research, we chose to use the email systems
of large higher education institutions, as we antici-
pated that this would elicit a better response than
from a primary care mailshot. Previous analyses of
quantitative data from this survey have tested specific
hypotheses; finding an increased risk of suicide at-
tempt and poor occupational functioning [3], and sig-
nificantly
higher
stigma,
shame,
responsibility
and
guilt [29] scores in people bereaved by suicide com-
pared with those bereaved by other sudden mortality
causes. To develop our theoretical understanding of
these
associations
we
also
collected
free

re-
sponses to conduct an exploratory analysis of qualita-
tive data in relation to a specific research question:
How does a friend or relative’s suicide influence an
individual’s own attitude towards dying by suicide?
Methods
Study design and participants
We invited all adults aged 18–40 (to include a young
adult age range) who were working or studying at UK
higher education institutions (HEIs) to participate in a
closed, online study about sudden bereavement: the
UCL Bereavement Study. The 18–40 age range was
chosen to reflect the group of greatest policy interest at
the time of designing the study [30]. We used a higher
upper age limit than that used by the World Health
Organisation (WHO) for young adults [27] in order to
Pitman et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:400 
Page 2 of 11
 avoid collecting only the recent experiences of young be-
reaved adults.
We used the email systems of large institutions be-
cause we judged that this would be the best means of
accessing hard-to-reach groups, whilst avoiding the
biases associated with recruiting a help-seeking sam-
ple [31]. Our intention was that internet-mediated
sampling would enhance recruitment of young men.
We sampled from a diverse range of colleges and uni-
versities, including art, drama, veterinary and agricul-
tural colleges; offering unique access to a large, varied
but defined sample of young adults. We have de-
scribed this sampling strategy previously [3].
All 164 HEIs in the UK in 2010 were invited to partici-
pate, and over 20% (37/164) agreed to take part, with a
higher response (40%) from the Russell Group of univer-
sities (characterised by high income from research fund-
ing bodies). This provided a sampling frame of 659,572
staff and students. All participants were invited to take
part in a survey of “the impact of sudden bereavement
on young adults”; masking them to the study hypotheses.
There was no accurate way of measuring response rate
as the denominator of bereaved people was not ascer-
tainable using routine data or survey methods. The ma-
jority of participating HEIs agreed to send an individual
email invitation with embedded survey link to each staff
and student member. For reasons of sensitivity (recent
staff/student deaths) ten HEIs modified this strategy, for
example by emailing students only, using their weekly
news digest email, or advertising via staff and student
intranet.
Inclusion criteria were as follows: people aged 18–
40 who, since the age of ten, had experienced sudden
bereavement of a close friend or relative. Early child-
hood bereavements were excluded to minimise recall
bias and restrict our focus to adult cognitive process-
ing of life events, using the age threshold for criminal
responsibility in England and Wales. A close contact
was defined as “a relative or friend who mattered to
you, and from whom you were able to obtain sup-
port, either emotional or practical”. Sudden bereave-
ment was operationalised as “a death that could not
have been predicted at that time and which occurred
suddenly or within a matter of days”. Exposure status
was classified by responses to the question: “Since
you were aged 10 have you experienced a sudden be-
reavement of someone close to you due to any of the
following: a) sudden natural death (eg. cardiac arrest,
epileptic seizure, stroke); b) sudden un-natural death
(eg. road crash, murder or manslaughter, work acci-
dent); c) suicide?” Mode of death was defined subject-
ively by the respondent, and not by coroner’s verdict
or death certificate, as perception of bereavement type
was the exposure of interest.
Procedures
Having consulted the COREQ guidelines on the de-
sign and reporting of qualitative research [32], an on-
line questionnaire [3] was designed by AP, FS, DO,
and MK. This was in consultation with a group of
young bereaved adults and bereavement counsellors,
who suggested which domains to cover and the ap-
propriate
wording
of
questions.
It
contained
119
fixed-response questions eliciting quantitative data on
socio-demographic and clinical characteristics, and 20
open questions to probe specific dimensions of the
impact of bereavement, eliciting free-text qualitative
data. The questions were intended to be non-leading
and neutral, so as to avoid assuming only negative
outcomes
of
bereavement.
The
questionnaire
was
piloted as an open survey on the websites of the na-
tional
voluntary
sector
organisations
Samaritans,
Cruse Bereavement Care, Survivors of Bereavement by
Suicide, and Widowed by Suicide. Responses were
reviewed and changes were made to the wording of
specific questions, and branching was improved to re-
duce the time taken to complete.
Amongst the open questions, one probed respondents’
attitudes to their own death, and was worded: “To what
extent has their death made you fear that you may die
in a similar way?” This had no upper word limit. Re-
spondents were invited to give as much or little detail as
they wished, or to skip the question if it did not apply.
Information provided to participants explained that the
study was being conducted by a research team at UCL,
including research psychiatrists (AP, DO, MK) and a
medical sociologist (FS), and that data would be handled
in accordance with data protection legislation.
All participants provided online informed consent.
The study protocol was approved by the UCL Research
Ethics Committee in 2010 (reference: 1975/002).
Theoretical approach
In this study we took a primarily inductive approach,
acknowledging an awareness of potentially conflicting
theories in relation to the influence of suicide be-
reavement on attitudes to suicide. Joiner’s interper-
sonal theory of suicide proposes that exposure to the
experience of a close contact’s suicide habituates an
individual to death, reducing the associated fear [14].
This acquired capability for suicide could motivate
that individual to enact underlying suicidal ideation
[33].
The
Integrated
Motivational-Volitional
(IMV)
model of suicidal behaviour proposes that personal at-
titudes to suicide contribute to suicidal ideation, and
social modelling of suicidal behaviour contributes to
translating these thoughts into actions [14]. A personal
awareness of the genetic basis for suicidality [34] might
additionally engender beliefs about self-fulfilling prophecy,
Pitman et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:400 
Page 3 of 11
 providing motivation for suicidal intent in the context of
grief and distress. In contrast to these theories, it is pos-
sible that experience of the devastating impact on self and
others might increase an individual’s motivation to avoid
suicide [35]. Our exploratory approach acknowledged the
possibility of these and other positions being evidenced in
this dataset.
Analytic approach
We used an adapted form of thematic analysis [36] to
analyse free text responses to the question on atti-
tudes to own death, restricting our analysis to respon-
dents bereaved by suicide. Analysis was conducted
collaboratively (by AP, HN, VA and NM) using NVivo
software (QSR International Pty Ltd., 2014). After
data familiarisation, responses were organised using a
basic four-part classification: those who felt that, on
balance, their experience of suicide bereavement had
given rise to a fear of dying the same way, those who
did not, those who gave uninterpretable responses,
and those who stated “not applicable”.
We then moved to a more content-based, fine-grained
approach, at which point we excluded brief responses
such as “No”, “Yes”, “a little”, “somewhat”, or “to a large
extent” as these provided few insights. Following discus-
sions about emergent codes, the first 100 responses were
coded independently by two members of the team (HN
and VA) and compared for consistency of coding. Fol-
lowing assurance of a high level of agreement at this
stage, regular discussions within the research team
served to clarify the conceptual meanings of thematic
codes as coding progressed. HN then coded the full
dataset, building up a framework of new codes, sub-
codes, collapsed codes, and higher-order categories in
collaboration with AP, NM and VA. The revised frame-
work was reviewed to explore both the distribution of
responses across codes, and their meanings and content,
leading to the emergence of further categories and
higher-order themes. Data were then reviewed against
higher-order themes as a final validation of the concep-
tual coherence of the analysis.
Results
Sample characteristics
Of the estimated 659,572 bereaved and non-bereaved
people
receiving
the
email
invitation,
5085
people
responded to the questionnaire by clicking on the survey
link, and 4630 (91%) consented to participate in the online
study. Of the 3432 participants meeting inclusion criteria a
total of 2408 (70%) provided free-text responses to the
open question probing attitudes to own death. Within this
group, 429 reported having been bereaved by suicide, 525
by sudden unnatural mortality causes, and 1454 by sudden
natural mortality causes. We therefore analysed free text
responses for a sample of 429 respondents (see Fig. 1
and Additional file 1: Table S1: Characteristics of study
participants). This sample was predominantly female
(82%), and of white ethnicity (92%). The mean age of re-
spondents was 25.3, with a standard deviation of 5.9. The
median time since bereavement by suicide was 4 years,
with an inter-quartile range of 6.25. Roughly equal propor-
tions reported the suicide of a family member (53%) versus
that of a non-relative (45%). Among relatives, bereavement
was by the suicide of a father (31%), cousin (18%), uncle/
aunt (15%), brother (13%), mother (12%), grandparent
(5%), sister (5%), or niece/nephew (1%). Overall, in 70% of
cases the deceased had been male. The mean age of the
deceased was 33.1 with a standard deviation of 15.7 years.
Basic response characteristics
Of the 429 responses analysed to the question “To what
extent has their death made you fear that you may die in a
similar way?” a minority (see Fig. 1) were brief assenting
responses such as “Yes”, “a little”, “somewhat”, or “to a
large extent” (n = 30/429; 7%), or brief dissenting re-
sponses such as “No” (n = 125/429; 29%) or “not applic-
able” (n = 9/429; 2%). The remainder of responses (n =
265/429; 62%) contained more detail, varying in length up
to 120 words, and typically consisting of three sentences.
Responses conveying agreement with the question tended
to be slightly longer in elaborating reasons.
Initial basic content-based coding of the 265 longer
responses suggested that, after excluding those who indi-
cated that the question was not applicable (n = 9/265)
and those who gave uninterpretable responses conveying
no clear attitudes to own death (n = 12/429), a smaller
proportion of respondents (n = 93/265) felt that their
close contact’s suicide had induced a fear of dying the
same way than the proportion who felt that it had (n =
160/265). Combining brief and longer responses, whilst
assuming that ‘not applicable’ represented a negative
response, suggested that overall a third (n = 123/429;
29%) thought it conceivable that they might also die by
suicide, but that two thirds (n = 294/429; 68%) did not
feel this was likely. These proportions, however, mask
complexity and expression of more mixed views, which
are explored in more depth below.
Themes identified
Our more in-depth analysis of extensive responses
identified four key themes representing the attitudes
that respondents expressed towards suicide following
their experiences of suicide bereavement: 1) Suicide
as a more tangible option; 2) Identification with the
deceased and awareness of shared vulnerabilities to
suicide; 3) Personal determination to avoid suicide;
and 4) Beliefs regarding safeguards against suicide. In
presenting our thematic analysis, quotes are given as

Page 4 of 11
 provided in online typewritten responses. We cor-
rected spelling errors only where due to omitted or
inverted characters or where clarity was impeded.
Percentages are given to denote the prevalence of dif-
fering views expressed, with the denominator as the
sub-sample of 253 extended responses analysed. Some
responses were coded in more than one thematic
area.
Suicide as a more tangible option
About a quarter of respondents (n = 65; 26%) ex-
plained that the suicide of a close contact had made
suicide seem more tangible. Having never previously
considered it as an option, their experience of an-
other’s suicide had rendered it a more realistic exit
strategy from extreme distress, either for themselves
or for others. For some
within this group these
thoughts provoked fear, but for others they did not.
Normalisation of suicide
Some participants felt that the suicide of a loved one
had normalised suicide in a way that made it a less terri-
fying prospect, providing them with the reassurance that
this might be a feasible escape and a means of control-
ling one’s destiny.
“Knowing that if things get to be too difficult there's a
way out” (19 year old female, 9 years since uncle’s
suicide)
“If anything, it made it easier for me to consider and
attempt suicide. If he had not done it, I probably
would have not considered it in my lowest moments.”
(25 year old male, 9 years since brother’s suicide)
For a few participants bereaved by a friend’s suicide,
the exposure had stimulated their curiosity in the
experience.
“I think about it every so often, gives me an urge to
know what it feels like.” (20 year old male, 3 years
since friend’s suicide).
At the extremes, a small group of these respondents
described their own suicide as inevitable, even to the
point of romanticising it.
“I feel almost certain that I will commit suicide one
day. I think my body is too dramatic just to die
naturally.” (20 year old female, 4 years since friend’s
suicide).
Enhanced fear of suicide
The suicide of a close contact had brought some a
realisation that anyone in a state of extreme distress
might be vulnerable to suicide, including themselves.
This was sometimes articulated in terms of a loss of
control.

 “After his death I didn't think anyone around me was
capable of doing that, now I realise it can happen to
anyone, especially after my attempt, I fear that I will
end up dying in the same manner.” (18 year old
female, 1 year since friend’s suicide).
“I've never had suicidal thoughts, but I have often had
very anxious feelings of having been 'contaminated' by
violence, of having had my boundaries of what is
normal completely crashed …. it is essentially a fear
that results from having 'seen too much' about how
dark life can get and worrying that it will draw me in
and take control of me”. (31 year old female, 6 years
since brother’s suicide).
For some this fear of suicide was transient and confined
to the immediate aftermath of the bereavement, diminish-
ing over time.
“following [his] death it reared its ugly head that I too
could do this ….. sometimes it still comes into my
mind when I hear of a suicide but it is much less
frightening than before as I know it is not a choice I
want.” (39 year old female, 10 years since brother’s
suicide).
Alongside this new awareness of suicide as a per-
sonal
threat,
respondents
expressed
anxieties
that
others close to them might choose suicide. Those
who had lost a family member tended to fear other
family members dying by suicide, whilst those who
had lost a friend tended to relate their fears to other
friends. These fears had two dimensions: concern for
the potential risk to friends or relatives, but also a
dread of re-experiencing the same pain and grief.
“I just worry about other people dying. I don't want to
feel that level of pain and sadness again.” (32 year old
female, 15 years since friend’s suicide).
In cases where the suicide had been completely unex-
pected, with no apparent triggers, respondents re-
conceptualised suicide as completely unpredictable. This
created an anxiety that anyone in their social network
was potentially at risk, again invoking a sense of loss of
control.
“Not at all. I am just worried about how easy my
uncle could do this to himself. He seemed a self-
controlled, financially secure, confident, loving, family
man who enjoyed life. Finding no real reason is diffi-
cult. I now worry that it could happen to anyone in
my life.” (19 year old female, 8 months since uncle’s
suicide).
This anxiety was particularly apparent where relative
or friends were perceived to display vulnerabilities to
suicide through mental ill-health or isolation.
Identification with the deceased and awareness of shared
vulnerabilities to suicide
A minority (n = 43; 17%) of participants, predominantly
relatives of the deceased, focussed on the role that men-
tal illness had played in the suicide. They expressed fears
about developing the same mental illness, and worsening
to the point of becoming suicidal. Relatives were con-
cerned about genetic vulnerabilities to mental illness
and suicide, feeling powerless to escape inherited traits.
These fears were particularly acute for those who had
already experienced mental illness, and dreaded the pro-
spect
of
losing
control
to
depressive
and
suicidal
thoughts.
“After studying psychology at A Level I know her
psychological disorder can be genetic and this scares
me” (21 year old female, 10 years since mother’s
suicide).
“To quite a serious extent. I have a very similar
personality to my father with identical interests and
similar character traits. I have experienced depression
on a moderate scale on a handful of occasions and do
fear that I have inherited a gene that would make me
more prone to suicide. I worry that even if there is no
biological inheritance other factors, for example being
brought up with similar values and expectations, may
make me more prone to suicide” (23 year old male,
4 years since father’s suicide).
The minority who were non-relatives recognised shared
personality traits and social difficulties, understanding
these as contributing to suicide risk.
“He killed himself because of the personal horrors he
suffered. I suffered something similar, so sometimes
wonder if I will become desperate too.” (22 year old
female, 6 years since friend’s suicide).
Personal determination to avoid suicide
Nearly half of respondents (n = 112; 44%) expressed a con-
viction, which for many had become stronger since their
bereavement, that they would not die by suicide them-
selves. Their painful experiences of suicide bereavement
had enhanced their awareness of the negative impact of
suicide on family and close friends, creating a desire to
avoid affecting others in the same way. Some in this group
described an enhanced appreciation of life and a deter-
mination to live life to the full.
Pitman et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:400 
Page 6 of 11
 “Her death has made me value life more and want to
live life for as long as possible.” (20 year old female,
2 years since friend’s suicide).
However others implied an underlying sense that sui-
cide had become a more tangible option (Theme 1),
representing an overlap between themes.
“I will not commit suicide because I see what it can do
to whole family circles. I don't think it's a selfish thing
to do, sometimes people can't cope but it gives me
strength.” (21 year old female, 6 years since cousin’s
suicide).
“It's made me think that it's an option, but knowing
what it does to those around you stops me doing it.”
(27 year old female, 7 years since friend’s suicide).
Some respondents described a new awareness of the
violent nature of a suicidal death, recognising through
their aversion to this that they lacked the capability to
attempt suicide. Their responses conveyed a sense of
taking control of their own destiny.
“His suicide was quite violent … and if anything this
strengthened the feeling that I would not want to, or
be prepared to, die in the same way.” (32 year old
female, 2 years since friend’s suicide).
Some were struck by their own complete inability to
understand the suicidal mind, even in someone known
to them. This had reinforced their sense that suicide was
not an option for them.
“It has not. It made me realise that I am not really
able to understand how you can be desperate enough
not to think anymore that better days will come”
(30 year old female, 1 year since cousin’s suicide).
A few participants alluded to having re-evaluated
their views on suicide, reaching the conclusion that this
was now something that they would never choose.
Again this overlapped with theme 1, in that these
thoughts followed a realisation that suicide might be an
option.
“I made a decision in the months following his death. I
sat all night and made the decision to keep living with
all that entailed - old age, death by bus….cancer,
murder, loneliness - so if ever my thoughts return to
the way he died I remember that long night and the
promise I am keeping every day of my life no matter
how hard it is.” (36 year old female, 10 years since
partner’s suicide).
Beliefs regarding safeguards against suicide
A small minority (n = 26; 10%) of respondents felt
that they needed to make active efforts to reduce the
chances that they, or others, might become suicidal.
These views were sometimes manifested in behav-
ioural changes, as a means of controlling a presumed
risk of suicide. An awareness of shared vulnerabilities
to suicide (Theme 2) was implied as the basis for
these behaviour strategies, representing an overlap in
these themes, and again applying primarily to relatives
of the person who had died by suicide.
Some described an awareness of the importance, for
both themselves and others, of developing psychological
coping strategies to prevent feelings escalating or be-
coming overwhelming. They mentioned an awareness of
a need to avoid isolation, and to seek help at an early
stage.
“…I sometimes think about how I may get stuck into
the same thought process later on in life but on the
other hand I keep to a focus and know what feelings
and thoughts to avoid as I have a point of reference
with what happened to my father.” (23 year old male,
2 years since father’s suicide).
“Not at all- I know that if I ever felt sad, I could talk
to my friends and brother and change my situation so
that I felt happy again. If I ever felt depressed, I would
ask for help before things got that bad because I know
how suicide affects people close to you.” (20 year old
male, 5 years since father’s suicide).
“Not really, but has made me more aware of making
sure that anyone in a similar situation gets the help
they need” (22 year old male, 1 year since brother’s
suicide).
In some cases a fear of dying a similar way had re-
sulted in avoidant behaviour, conceptualised as a means
of safeguarding themselves or others from suicide.
“Their suicide was committed through an overdose of
medication. For 5 years after the death I refused to
take any medication fearing that I would accidentally
take too much and end up ill.” (20 year old female,
8 years since cousin’s suicide).
Avoidant behaviour strategies included blocking trans-
mission of genetic vulnerabilities.
“…I have a greater fear that [death by suicide] might
happen if I have children, & this is one of the big
reasons why I am terrified to have children - in case
they are mentally unwell &/or die like that. Having
Pitman et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:400

 watched what happened to my parents & my aunt &
uncle, I could never do that.” (26 year old female,
8 years since cousin’s suicide).
Discussion
Main findings
Our survey of young adults in British higher education
institutions has identified a broad and complex range of
attitudes to suicide following personal experience of a
close contact’s suicide. The sense of gaining or losing
control featured across all four of the themes that we
identified. Respondents who described a determination to
avoid suicide appeared to seek to exercise control over a
perceived risk. Their awareness of the devastating and
widespread grief the suicide had wreaked seemed to have
deterred
them
from
considering
suicide
themselves.
Respondents who perceived their own susceptibility to
suicide described a sense of inevitability, which they either
battled against or submitted to. Among those who de-
scribed an awareness of shared vulnerabilities to suicide,
some appeared to convey a fear of being subject to a self-
fulling prophecy, although this was not mentioned expli-
citly. This sense of inevitability was described by both
friends and relatives, and was therefore not construed
solely in terms of heritability. A small minority of our
sample described a diminution of the fear of suicide, hav-
ing re-evaluated it as a viable future means of escaping
(and therefore controlling) threat. Such views corre-
sponded to theoretical constructs of social modelling of
suicidal behaviour, although again this was not mentioned
explicitly. However, these views also demonstrated that
terms such as ‘imitative suicidal behaviour’ convey an
over-simplified passive process, rather than the more
complex process of discovering meaning in a suicide and
how such meaning influences one’s attitudes and behav-
iour, as detected in our data.
The ideas expressed in our study also map to theories
of locus of control and research describing the associ-
ation between an external locus of control orientation
and suicidal behaviour [37]. The thoughts of inevitability
and self-fulfilling prophecy expressed in these data are
consistent with an external locus of control, while those
describing resolutions to avoid suicide and behavioural
changes are consistent with an internal locus of control.
In keeping with sociological perspectives on bereave-
ment, [38] our findings suggest that the specific affinity
an individual has to a relative or close friend who dies
by suicide (whether they were aware of shared vulner-
abilities to mental health problems, or found the suicide
completely unexpected) influences the meaning they as-
sign to the suicide, and that this in turn influences their
subsequent mental health and their attitudes to their
own suicide.
Our two stage coding revealed the complexity and
sometimes ambivalence of responses. The four themes
identified in our fine-grained analysis did not map dir-
ectly to the initial basic classification of those who did
and did not fear dying by suicide. Rather than represent-
ing sub-groups of this binary classification, themes 1, 2
and 4 included the views of both those with a reduced
fear of suicide and those with an enhanced fear. Only in
theme 2, an awareness of shared vulnerabilities to sui-
cide, were responses all contextualised in a fear of dying
the same way. The degree to which young adults be-
reaved by suicide feared suicide appeared to be a func-
tion of how much they felt they could control their
destiny, which influenced the strength of their determin-
ation not to die that way. Because of this complexity it is
difficult to determine the degree to which a fear of sui-
cide might be regarded as protective against suicide.
Broadly our findings suggest that for some individuals
the experience of suicide bereavement might increase
their chances of modelling suicidal behaviour, whilst for
others it might deter against suicide by triggering posi-
tive behaviour change. Whether or not an awareness of
vulnerability translates into behaviour change is likely to
depend on various personality traits, including an indi-
vidual’s locus of control. Exploring whether someone be-
reaved by suicide feels in control of their own mortality
is likely to be a useful means of uncovering their atti-
tudes to their own suicide.
Results in the context of other studies
Both quantitative and qualitative approaches have been
used in the few studies attempting to explore attitudes
to suicide after exposure to suicide. Some quantitative
studies have used standardised attitudinal measures [39–
41]. A population-based survey of 5117 Japanese adults
bereaved by suicide compared with 2757 unexposed
controls found that those bereaved by suicide were more
likely to hold attitudes towards suicide as inevitable and
not preventable [39]. This must be interpreted in the
context of the greater tolerance of suicide in Japanese
culture [42]. In a US study 85 young adults exposed to a
peer suicide cluster in adolescence were more likely than
67 unexposed controls to normalise suicide but also
more likely to find it incomprehensible [40]. Those who
rated themselves as close to the deceased were more
likely to identify with the attitudes “People often die by
suicide on a whim”, and “If people want to die by suicide,
we can’t stop them” [40]. A study of 54 workers in a US
suicide intervention centre found that they had a greater
fear of death than 62 psychology student controls, but
such fears were not specific to suicide [41]. In an Austra-
lian study of 251 men who had recently attempted suicide,
67% described the feared impact on relatives as a deterrent
against further suicide attempts [43].
Pitman et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:400 
Page 8 of 11
 These findings of normalising and permissive attitudes
to suicide following exposure, a greater fear of death,
and an awareness of the impact on others, are complex
and highlight the need for qualitative approaches to gain
a deeper understanding of underlying cognitions. Quali-
tative interviews with 36 suicidal young men in North-
ern Ireland showed that those exposed to peer suicide
observed the devastating effects on friends and family,
with the authors suggesting that this served as protective
against suicide [35]. The informal accounts of US ado-
lescents followed up after a friend’s suicide were that the
experience had inhibited their own suicidal behaviour
because of the perceived devastating effects on friends
and family [44]. Our findings, within a large and repre-
sentative dataset, of a deterrent effect, a normalising ef-
fect,
and
a
fear
of
own
suicide,
are
novel
and
demonstrate the complexity and diversity of attitudinal
change after suicide. These findings build on the findings
of the above studies, and provide much more detail as to
how such attitudes had arisen and had subsequently
been enacted in behaviour change.
Strengths and limitations
To our knowledge this is the largest qualitative study of
the attitudes of people bereaved by suicide towards their
own risk of suicide. Effects of interviewer presence, in-
cluding social desirability effects, were reduced through
the anonymity afforded by an internet-mediated ap-
proach [31]. Our study did not use validated instruments
to measure attitudes to suicide, but instead used open
questions, allowing respondents an opportunity to elab-
orate their own views rather than respond to fixed-
format questions. However, without interaction with re-
spondents we were unable to probe the themes identi-
fied in more detail, or respond if participants became
distressed. In qualitative terms, open-ended survey ques-
tions produce small amounts of data per person and are
less able to access broad subjective experiences or life
worlds than more personalised methods. In lacking a
sense of respondents’ cultural frames, we were unable to
explore how the meaning they ascribed to the suicide
loss was influenced by their interactions with their social
groups or societal culture. The wording of the question
used to explore attitudes to suicide was guided by con-
sultation with bereaved people for use in a sample be-
reaved by a range of natural and unnatural causes of
sudden death. Use of the term ‘fear’ instead of ‘think’
was judged to be appropriate in this context, to avoid
implying that such an outcome was inevitable. However,
this may have encouraged people to include fear con-
cepts in their responses, and made it harder to differen-
tiate between responses alluding to probability of suicide
versus fear of suicide. In analysing data from one ques-
tion among a larger corpus of 20 qualitative questions
there is a risk of losing context and failing to capture the
totality of respondents’ positions. However, other ques-
tions addressed relationships, support experiences, and
occupational impact, whereas this was the only one
probing attitudes to suicide. Discussions between a team
of four researchers enhanced reflexivity, and helped to
ensure conceptual clarity and rigour in the analytic
process. Our sampling of a large but defined population
elicited a wide range of views, but our method resulted
in over-representation of white individuals and highly-
educated females. Given cultural dimensions to attitudes
towards suicide, our findings may not be generalisable to
other ethnic or social groups in the UK or beyond.
Clinical and policy implications
Our work identified a sub-set of bereaved adults for
whom suicide had become a realistic option, whether
this was feared or not. Depending on other clinical fac-
tors, such as depressive cognitions, substance misuse,
and personality traits, these individuals could potentially
be at higher risk of suicide, driven by a fundamental
change in attitudes since the loss. This group are of clin-
ical concern given the associations between suicide be-
reavement and subsequent fatal [2] and non-fatal [3]
suicide attempt. Psychiatric assessments routinely probe
for family history of suicide as part of suicide risk assess-
ment. Given recent epidemiological evidence [2, 3] they
should also inquire about suicides in non-relatives. Our
qualitative findings suggest that a history of bereavement
by the suicide of a friend or relative should prompt an
exploration of attitudes to suicide, perhaps using the
question posed in this survey. The ethical challenge is
whether psychosocial interventions with people contem-
plating suicide should invite consideration of the impact
on close contacts, attempting to invoke this as a protect-
ive factor. Such work would need to be done skilfully to
avoid worsening cognitive symptoms of guilt or anger.
For those actively considering suicide it would be worth
asking about methods considered, as clinical experience
suggests that suicide-bereaved people describe enhanced
awareness of a specific lethal method. Practitioners en-
countering anyone bereaved by suicide should direct
them to available sources of support [45].
Future research
The most valid means of investigating how attitudes to
suicide are influenced by suicide bereavement is by
measuring attitudes before and after exposure. However,
as suicide is a relatively rare event this presents prob-
lems of study design. Longitudinal studies comparing
problem-solving in individuals affected by significant life
events such as job loss, bereavement, or relationship
breakdown might identify cognitive markers of suscepti-
bility to suicide attempt, informing the development of
Pitman et al. BMC Psychiatry  (2017) 17:400 
Page 9 of 11
 psychological interventions to mitigate this risk. Qualita-
tive work with previously suicidal individuals is required
to understand whether it is ethical and acceptable to dis-
cuss the impact of suicide on close contacts, and
whether encouraging alternative coping strategies to sui-
cide is feasible and acceptable to individuals who do not
fear suicide. Recent English commissioning guidance on
providing services for people bereaved by suicide de-
scribes the development of a range of support, including
immediate outreach, group peer support, and individual
counselling [46, 47]. This is in line with the perceived
needs of this group [48]. However, whilst guidance is
provided on service evaluation [49], there is also a need
for randomised controlled trials of interventions de-
signed to improve health and mortality outcomes, pro-
viding evidence that findings can be implemented in
other settings.
Conclusions
This qualitative analysis of British data from 429 adults
bereaved by suicide reveals a range of attitudes to suicide,
with a minority reappraising suicide as a realistic personal
option. Others expressed a determination never to choose
suicide, with some elaborating the positive steps they had
taken to reduce their own and others’ risk. Given quantita-
tive evidence of an increased risk of suicide in people be-
reaved by suicide, it is important to find ways of engaging
and supporting this group. Professionals providing sup-
port after suicide bereavement should explore an individ-
ual’s attitudes to own suicide as part of suicide risk
assessment and management. Sensitive handling of infor-
mation divulged could help mitigate the theoretical risk of
acting on suicidal thoughts, perhaps by exploring alterna-
tive coping strategies.
