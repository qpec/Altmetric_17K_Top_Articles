BACKGROUND
The intent of the original incidental findings recommenda-
tions1 was that clinical diagnostic laboratories performing 
exome or genome sequencing should report known pathogenic 
(KP) or expected pathogenic (EP) variants in the 56 American 
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) genes 
even when unrelated to the primary medical reason for testing. 
Subsequently, the ACMG revised the terminology to  
“secondary 
findings” (SFs) because these genes are intentionally being 
analyzed, as opposed to genetic variants found incidentally or

To promote standardized reporting of actionable information from 
clinical genomic sequencing, in 2013, the American College of Medi-
cal Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) published a minimum list of 
genes to be reported as incidental or secondary findings. The goal was 
to identify and manage risks for selected highly penetrant genetic dis-
orders through established interventions aimed at preventing or sig-
nificantly reducing morbidity and mortality. The ACMG subsequently 
established the Secondary Findings Maintenance Working Group to 
develop a process for curating and updating the list over time. We 
describe here the new process for accepting and evaluating nomina-
tions for updates to the secondary findings list. We also report out-
comes from six nominations received in the initial 15 months after the 
process was implemented. Applying the new process while uphold-
ing the core principles of the original policy statement resulted in 
the addition of four genes and removal of one gene; one gene did not 
meet criteria for inclusion. The updated secondary findings minimum 
list includes 59 medically actionable genes recommended for return 
in clinical genomic sequencing. We discuss future areas of focus, 
encourage continued input from the medical community, and call for 
research on the impact of returning genomic secondary findings.

accidentally; the shift in terminology also maintained consis-
tency with a recommendation by the Presidential Commission 
on Bioethical Issues.2 An additional modification to the origi-
nal policy included offering an option to opt-out of receiving 
SFs for individuals undergoing clinical genomic sequencing 
(GS).3 This revision was due, in part, to results from a survey 
of ACMG members in which more than 80% of respondents 
supported an option for patients undergoing GS to decline SF 
analysis following appropriate counseling. In addition, more 
than 90% of respondents supported a minimum list of SFs that 
would be updated and refined over time. This article concluded 
that according to its membership, the ACMG “should update a 
list of genes to be assessed when clinical genome-scale sequenc-
ing is performed. Informed consent is necessary, and reporting 
of secondary findings should be optional.”4
The ACMG Board of Directors created the ACMG Secondary 
Findings Maintenance Working Group (SFWG) in 2014 to 
define and implement a process for updating the SF list. In 
March 2015, the process for nominating revisions to the list was 
announced to the ACMG community.
MAteRiALS AND MetHODS
Nominations for genes/conditions to add to or remove from the 
SF list were accepted from ACMG members via a nomination 
form (see Supplementary file S1 online) that was developed 
through a subcommittee of the SFWG. The form was refined 
based on feedback from SFWG members and clinical genetics/
genomics colleagues. Data collected included phenotypes asso-
ciated with the gene, ordered by prevalence, and reported vari-
ants in the gene from ClinVar and the Human Gene Mutation 
Database. Also collected was information required to determine 
whether the gene/condition warranted inclusion based on clin-
ical features, likelihood of early clinical diagnosis by a pediatri-
cian/internist, molecular genetic characteristics, clinical genetic 
testing options, and medical actionability. Initially, medical 
actionability was evaluated according to a semiquantitative 
metric that included the following major adjudication criteria: 
severity of disease/nature of the health threat; likelihood of the 
disease/health threat materializing (i.e., penetrance); efficacy 
of specific intervention(s); and overall strength of the current 
knowledge base about the gene/condition. In July 2015, a fifth 
criterion was added: acceptability of the proposed intervention 
based on its risks and benefits. The SFWG acknowledged the 
inherent subjectivity and difficulty of rating any given inter-
vention as it applies to an individual but voted unanimously in 
favor of adding this fifth criterion. This achieved consistency 
with efforts of the NIH-funded Clinical Genome Resource 
(ClinGen)5 Actionability Working Group,6 which had already 
applied these five criteria to assign actionability scores (called 
“
Actionability Evidence-based Summaries”)7 to genes/condi-
tions on the SF list.
Each nomination form was completed by an ACMG mem-
ber or completed by a non-member and then submitted by 
an ACMG member. Completed forms were reviewed by the 
SFWG in a study section–like model. We also reviewed the 
Actionability Evidence-based Summary for any genes already 
reviewed by the ClinGen Actionability Working Group. Each 
form was presented in a SFWG meeting or conference call by 
the submitter or a designee. After thorough discussion of the 
rationale for making the proposed change, SFWG members 
voted on whether to accept the submitter’s recommendation.
Nominations that were recommended by the SFWG were 
sent to the ACMG Board of Directors with a summary of the 
SFWG discussion, voting outcome, and a recommendation 
for the suggested change to the SF minimum list. The Board 
reviewed each recommendation on a gene-by-gene basis in July 
2016 and September 2016.
The SFWG discussed and unanimously agreed on a nomen-
clature to support versioning of the SF list, reflecting both major 
and minor revisions. Major revisions could be necessary due to 
conceptual changes to the categories of genes/variants included 
or the addition or removal of many genes in a single update. A 
major revision will be denoted by changing the version num-
ber to the next integer (v3.0, v4.0, etc.). Minor revisions reflect 
addition or removal of one or a few genes or variants and will be 
denoted by changing the number after the decimal point (v2.1, 
v2.2, etc.). Any new version number will be followed by the 
month and year in which the update was published. The ACMG 
Board has approved this versioning nomenclature.
ReSULtS
To refine the nomination form to collect all relevant informa-
tion, SFWG members and colleagues were requested to com-
plete nomination forms for 28 genes already on the SF list. Of 
these, the SFWG unanimously supported removal of one gene: 
MYLK associated with familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and 
dissection (FTAAD).
Between March 2015 and May 2016, five nominations for 
additions to the SF list were received and evaluated by the 
SFWG. One of these, PTCH1 associated with Gorlin syn-
drome/nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, did not achieve 
SFWG consensus for addition due to insufficient evidence that 
knowledge of a KP/EP variant in the gene would alter medi-
cal management. Each of the other four genes—ATP7B asso-
ciated with Wilson disease, BMPR1A and SMAD4 associated 
with juvenile polyposis, and OTC associated with ornithine 
transcarbamylase deficiency—received a unanimous vote from 
SFWG members for addition to the list. The ACMG Board sub-
sequently reviewed and approved each of the five recommenda-
tions of the SFWG: removal of MYLK and addition of ATP7B, 
BMPR1A, SMAD4, and OTC.
The following paragraphs describe these genes and the ratio-
nale for removing or adding each of them according to the cri-
teria outlined above.
Key features of MYLK include the rarity of KP variants, all 
of which are loss-of-function variants, as well as the lack of 
an effective confirmatory test, screening modality, or inter-
vention to prevent or reduce morbidity or mortality from 
FTAAD. Because aortic dissection related to variants in MYLK 
often presents without a history of aortic enlargement, the

intervention of echocardiogram may be falsely reassuring and 
may not prevent sudden cardiac death.8 In addition, there is 
insufficient evidence on the appropriate age to begin medica-
tions and the efficacy of this intervention to reduce dynamic 
stress on the aorta.9 The SFWG considered that additional data 
on MYLK are likely to be gathered in the coming years from 
aneurysm genetic testing panels, and this evidence could be re-
evaluated periodically for possible re-addition of MYLK to the 
SF list.
ATP7B is associated with autosomal-recessive Wilson dis-
ease (MIM 277900). Morbidity among homozygotes directly 
correlates with copper deposition in the liver, brain, and eye. 
The disease is progressive, and, if left untreated, premature 
death is likely. In some cases, liver failure may be the present-
ing sign. Given its long recognition as a Mendelian disorder, it 
is reasonable to consider Wilson disease to be at least relatively 
highly penetrant. Expressivity is variable. Treatment for Wilson 
disease involves administration of copper chelating agents and/
or zinc to block intestinal absorption of copper; treatment is 
extremely effective when administered prior to the onset of 
symptoms.10–12 Sanger sequencing of the ATP7B gene is consid-
ered confirmatory in asymptomatic patients. In symptomatic 
patients, in addition to Sanger sequencing, the results of serum 
ceruloplasmin, serum copper concentration, and 14-hour urine 
copper excretion can be diagnostic. The ClinGen Actionability 
scoring process generated a high actionability score of 10/12 for 
copper chelation and zinc therapy in the treatment of ATP7B-
associated liver disease and/or neuropsychiatric disease.7 Based 
on this evidence, the SFWG voted unanimously to add ATP7B 
to the SF list for the recessive state in which two KP/EP variants 
are detected in trans through GS.
BMPR1A and SMAD4 are two genes known to cause auto-
somal-dominant juvenile polyposis syndrome (MIM 174900), 
which is associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, anemia, 
and increased risk of colon cancer and other GI cancers. An 
individual with a KP/EP variant in BMPR1A has a more than 
90% chance of developing polyps and a 10–50% lifetime risk of 
developing cancer. The majority of patients with clinical features 
of the disease have colon polyps by age 20, and colon cancer 
typically develops by the mid-40s. Screening via endoscopy with 
histological confirmation of juvenile-type polyps is readily avail-
able, highly sensitive, effective at reducing morbidity, and pres-
ents minimal risk or burden. Although most individuals with 
a BMPR1A variant have a positive family history, many cases 
remain undetected because GI cancer screening is not routine in 
the general population before age 50. Penetrance of KP/EP vari-
ants in SMAD4 is estimated to be approximately 20% for colon 
cancer by age 35 and nearly 70% by age 65, with the average age 
of onset reported to be in the early 40s. Gastric cancer occurs 
in approximately 21% of patients with gastric polyps. Screening 
via colonoscopy and upper GI endoscopy for polyps are effec-
tive interventions for risk reduction.13 The SFWG unanimously 
agreed that juvenile polyposis syndrome associated with KP/EP 
variants in BMPR1A and SMAD4 meets criteria for addition to 
the SF list based on the existing knowledge base.
Physicians should be aware that hereditary hemorrhagic 
telangiectasia syndrome is another phenotype associated with 
loss-of-function variants in SMAD4. Hemorrhagic telangiecta-
sia syndrome involves a risk of sudden death due to arteriove-
nous malformation rupture and aortopathy as well as morbidity 
due to anemia and/or hypoxia. Screening includes imaging and 
embolization for arteriovenous malformations.14 A patient with 
a KP/EP variant identified in SMAD4 is potentially at risk for 
juvenile polyposis and/or hemorrhagic telangiectasia syndrome 
and therefore should be screened for both diseases.
Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency (MIM 311250) is a 
urea cycle defect caused by variants in the X-linked OTC gene. 
Severely affected males present within the first week of life with 
hyperammonemic coma that is associated with high neona-
tal mortality; long-term survivors have significant neurologic 
deficits and intellectual disability.15 Penetrance in hemizygous 
males is nearly 100%, although cases in which there is partial 
expression of the mutated allele with residual enzyme activ-
ity often present later with milder symptoms. In heterozygous 
females, penetrance estimates range from approximately 20 to 
30%.16,17 The phenotype among affected females varies widely 
from mild to severe, depending primarily on the pattern of 
X-inactivation of the gene in hepatocytes.15 Interventions exist 
to prevent crises and ameliorate outcomes, including protein 
restriction in the diet and medications that remove ammonia 
by alternate metabolic pathways.18 These treatments are most 
useful in symptomatic heterozygous females and among males 
with later onset or partial disease. Medical management may 
also include the potential for prolonged hospitalization dur-
ing illness as well as dialysis for acute crises with hyperammo-
nemia to help prevent or minimize brain damage. For males 
with severe disease who present in the neonatal period, and for 
some males and females with later-onset disease, liver trans-
plantation is recommended due to the high risk for recurrent 
hyperammonemia, subsequent neurological deterioration, 
and/or death.19 OTC deficiency is included on newborn screen-
ing panels in only some states; however, males with severe dis-
ease often become ill in the first 2–3 days of life, when newborn 
screening results are not yet available. Given the morbidity and 
mortality risks, the SFWG voted unanimously to add ornithine 
transcarbamylase deficiency associated with KP/EP variants in 
the OTC gene to the SF list.
In selecting the variant types to recommend for return, the 
SFWG considered using the terminology of “pathogenic” and 
“likely pathogenic” according to updated variant classification 
criteria20 published since the original policy statement, but ulti-
mately decided to maintain the terminology of KP and EP. This 
decision was based on a recognition that classifying a variant as 
likely pathogenic is more burdensome for laboratories, whereas 
an EP classification is simpler because it is limited to loss- 
of-function variants and novel missense variants need not be 
analyzed as SFs.

ACMG SF v2.0 (September, 2016)” 
updated list of SFs recommended for return from clinical GS.

This article highlights the process for nominating changes to the 
ACMG Secondary Findings minimum list. This process and form 
were piloted by SFWG members and colleagues before soliciting 
nominations from the ACMG membership. Goals for the nomi-
nation process were to (i) make the nomination form accessible 
through the ACMG website; (ii) collect information from the 
broader community to inform decision-making by the SFWG 
and the Board; and (iii) update the gene list at least annually in a 
way that is inclusive of ACMG members. We hope to transition 
to a web-based nomination process such that submission of sup-
porting information would directly populate a database.
The nomination form has been designed to accept nomina-
tions for additions to as well as removals from the SF list. Five 
formal nominations for adding genes/conditions to the SF list 
were received between March 2015 and March 2016, and four 
of these have been added to the ACMG SF v2.0 list based on 
unanimous consensus among SFWG members and approval 
by the ACMG Board. In addition, one gene has been recom-
mended and approved for removal. It is our hope that this 
article will stimulate additional nominations from the ACMG 
membership and broader medical community for genes to con-
sider adding to the ACMG SF v2.0 list, as well as further assess-
ment of the evidence to support genes/conditions already on 
the list.
Our group has attempted to uphold the principles outlined 
in the original policy statement1 while expanding on certain 
aspects. We have continued to focus primarily on SFs related 
to monogenic disorders for which there is evidence of clini-
cal utility. Additionally, we have attempted to standardize 
the evaluation of current and prospective genes by adopting 
a process that includes a semiquantitative metric for deter-
mining actionability that is consistent with the goals of the 
ClinGen Actionability Working Group. We continue to sup-
port the reporting of known or expected pathogenic variants, 
but we do not recommend reporting variants of uncertain 
significance as SFs. Among the challenges inherent in devel-
oping and curating this list, we recognize the presumption of 
high penetrance for these genes and diseases based on poten-
tially biased case ascertainment. Specifically, literature reports 
for many of these conditions represent assessment of disease 
probands and their families. Over time, we may discover 
that penetrance for some of these conditions is lower than 
current estimates suggest. We anticipate that the increasing 
availability of large population databases, such as the Exome 
Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), will be helpful in refining 
estimates of penetrance, which may inform future curation of 
the ACMG SF v2.0 list.

Considering pharmacogenomic variants
Although the main mission of the SFWG is to focus on genetic 
changes with high penetrance for actionable phenotypes, 
incorporation of pharmacogenomic (PGx) variants onto a SF 
minimum list has also been considered. A preliminary ver-
sion of a PGx nomination form is being developed, and SFWG 
discussions have focused on the actionability of findings for 
PGx variants. Guidelines from the Clinical Pharmacogenetics

aSome conditions that may demonstrate semidominant inheritance have been indicated as autosomal-dominant (AD) for the sake of simplicity. Others have been 
labeled as X-linked (XL). bKP: known pathogenic, sequence variation is previously reported and is a recognized cause of the disorder; EP: expected pathogenic,  
sequence variation is previously unreported and is of the type that is expected to cause the disorder. Note: The recommendation to not report expected 
pathogenic variants for some genes is due to the recognition that truncating variants, the primary type of expected pathogenic variants, are not an established cause of 
some diseases on the list. cWe recommend searching only for individuals with biallelic mutations.

management recommendations on the basis of PGx results; 
however, assessing the impact of these results on clinical out-
comes has proven difficult due to a lack of randomized, con-
trolled trials and small numbers of patients for whom PGx 
results are available.
Implementation of PGx results based on secondary findings 
presents additional challenges. Calling sequence variants can be 
complex for several reasons: (i) in some cases, the presence of 
pseudogenes may confound sequence results; (ii) certain action-
able PGx “variants” are actually haplotypes composed of several 
variants, some of which are intronic and not covered by standard 
WES; (iii) the “star allele” nomenclature used for PGx variants 
is not familiar to most geneticists and needs simplification; and 
(iv) each testing laboratory would need to be provided with 
specific genomic coordinates to analyze to generate PGx diplo-
types. There are also challenges related to implementation of PGx 
results in clinical practice. Results from single gene disorders 
may require action in the near term, such as initiation of sur-
veillance, whereas PGx results are not actionable until the deci-
sion is made to prescribe a drug related to the PGx variant. The 
prescription of a drug at that time arguably offers a window for 
genetic testing for variants proven to be important in the drug’s 
administration; thus, proactive assessment may not be necessary. 
Finally, the need for certain drugs is rare and may never arise 
for an individual. However, some rare drugs have such severe 
side effects, including death, that identification of PGx variants 
is critical. For these reasons, we are focusing our initial attention 
on coding variants related to commonly prescribed medications 
as well as medications associated with serious adverse events for 
which there is greater urgency surrounding actionability.
expanding the nomination process
The SFWG plans to accept nominations from other professional 
specialty organizations, such as professional groups of genetic 
counselors, primary care clinicians, and other clinical specialists 
who may order or return results from GS and thereby encounter 
SFs in their practice. We hope that this process will help to engage 
the broader medical community in considering the implications 
of genomic SFs. The ACMG also intends to develop resources to 
assist clinicians in medical management based on specific SFs.
Assessing the impact of secondary findings
We recognize that the potential impact of reporting actionable 
SFs is significant and far-reaching. The SFWG hopes this process 
of nominations and updates will serve as a reference point in 
related efforts, such as initiatives that apply genetic and genomic 
testing in public health programs and population screening. 
Successful efforts have already been directed toward evaluating 
the efficacy of newborn screening panels in detecting genetic 
diseases,21,22 and a similar approach could begin to evaluate the 
utility of certain applications of genomic screening in healthy 
adults. The reporting of SFs presents significant opportunities to 
prevent disease, but this process may introduce fiscal and other 
costs, including those associated with further confirmatory 
testing. As clinical GS becomes less expensive and more wide-
spread, the amount of data and time required to communicate 
this information to patients will likely increase, as will the need 
for genetics/genomics education among primary care clinicians. 
The medical, legal, social, and economic implications of these 
trends are broad, and it will be important for the genomics com-
munity to study the impact of SFs on the busy clinician, indi-
vidual patients and families, and populations at large.
