Abstract
Importance—Individuals released from prison have high rates of violent reoffending, and there 
is uncertainty about whether pharmacological treatments reduce reoffending risk.
Objective—To investigate the associations between major classes of psychotropic medications 
and violent reoffending.
Design, Setting, and Participants—This cohort study included all released prisoners in 
Sweden from July 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010, through linkage of population-based registers. 
Rates of violent reoffending during medicated periods were compared with rates during 
nonmedicated periods using within-individual analyses. Follow-up ended December 31, 2013.

 Exposures—Periods with or without dispensed prescription of psychotropic medications 
(antipsychotics, antidepressants, psychostimulants, drugs used in addictive disorders, and 
antiepileptic drugs) after prison release. Prison-based psychological treatments were investigated 
as a secondary exposure.
Main Outcomes and Measures—Violent crime after release from prison.
Results—The cohort included 22 275 released prisoners (mean [SD] age, 38 [13] years; 91.9% 
male). During follow-up (median, 4.6 years; interquartile range, 3.0-6.4 years), 4031 individuals 
(18.1%) had 5653 violent reoffenses. The within-individual hazard ratio (HR) associated with 
dispensed antipsychotics was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.39-0.88), based on 100 events in 1596 person-years 
during medicated periods and 1044 events in 11 026 person-years during nonmedicated periods, 
equating to a risk difference of 39.7 (95% CI, 11.3-57.7) fewer violent reoffenses per 1000 person-
years. The within-individual HR associated with dispensed psychostimulants was 0.62 (95% CI, 
0.40-0.98), based on 94 events in 1648 person-years during medicated periods and 513 events in 
4553 person-years during nonmedicated periods, equating to a risk difference of 42.8 (95% CI, 
2.2-67.6) fewer violent reoffenses per 1000 person-years. The within-individual HR associated 
with dispensed drugs for addictive disorders was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.23-0.97), based on 46 events in 
1168 person-years during medicated periods and 1103 events in 15 725 person-years during 
nonmedicated periods, equating to a risk difference of 36.4 (95% CI, 2.1-54.0) fewer violent 
reoffenses per 1000 person-years. In contrast, antidepressants and antiepileptics were not 
significantly associated with violent reoffending rates (HR = 1.09 [95% CI, 0.83-1.43] and 1.14 
[95% CI, 0.79-1.65], respectively). The most common prison-based program was psychological 
treatments for substance abuse, associated with an HR of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63-0.89), which equated 
to a risk difference of 23.2 (95% CI, 10.3-34.1) fewer violent reoffenses per 1000 person-years.
Conclusions and Relevance—Among released prisoners in Sweden, rates of violent 
reoffending were lower during periods when individiduals were dispensed antipsychotics, 
psychostimulants, and drugs for addictive disorders, compared with periods in which they were 
not dispensed these medications. Further research is needed to understand the causal nature of this 
association.
There were more than 10 million prisoners worldwide in 2015, with approximately 2.2 
million in the United States alone.1 Despite reported decreases in violence in many 
countries, reoffending rates remain high. From 2005 through 2010, more than one-third of 
released prisoners in the United States and the United Kingdom were reconvicted of a new 
crime within 2 years.2,3 With planned reductions in prison populations in many countries, 
evidence to facilitate the safe release of large numbers of prisoners has become a research 
and policy priority.4
Most programs to reduce reoffending focus on psychosocial interventions, but their effect 
sizes are weak to moderate.5 As psychiatric and substance use disorders, which increase 
reoffending rates,6 are overrepresented among jail and prison populations,7 treatment with 
appropriate psychotropic medications offers an alternative strategy to reduce reoffending. In 
the general population, randomized clinical trials8 and observational studies9,10 have 
demonstrated associations between psychotropic medications and reductions in violence and 
crime. However, the evidence to modify reoffending risk is limited to a few small

 observational studies.11–13 Two major methodological issues restrict their validity. First, 
pharmacoepidemiologic studies are subject to confounding because of differences in 
indications for medication.14 That is, prisoners who are prescribed psychotropic 
medications are different (eg, more severe symptoms, comorbidity, or background risk) from 
those who are not. Second, nonadherence with medications is common in psychiatric 
patients,15 so more sensitive measures of medication exposure than simple categorization 
into treatment and nontreatment groups are required, as are approaches that account for 
individual differences in medication adherence.
This study investigated the main psychotropic medication classes prescribed to prisoners 
using longitudinal Swedish population registers and examined the association between 
prescription of psychotropic medication and risk of violent reoffending. For comparison, the 
associations of prison-based psychological treatments with reoffending were secondarily 
investigated.
Methods
Study Population
Data were obtained through linkage of population-based registers in Sweden, with unique 
personal identification numbers enabling accurate linkage.16 The study cohort consisted of 
all prisoners released between July 1, 2005, and December 31, 2010, from the Swedish 
Prison and Probation Service (SPPS). In addition to implementing sentences, the SPPS aims 
to reduce criminal recidivism and substance misuse by providing group-based, usually 
cognitive behavioral therapy–based programs. Complementary education and work skills 
training are also offered. In any given day, SPPS staff manage some 5000 inmates in 50 
prisons and an additional 12 500 parolees or probationers across 34 probation offices all over 
Sweden.17
All individuals were followed up from the day of release until death, emigration, 
reincarceration, or December 31, 2013, whichever happened first. The study was approved 
by the Regional Ethics Committee at Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, which 
waived the requirement of informed consent because this study is a register-based study of 
anonymized data.
Measures
Data on the main exposure, psychotropic medications, were extracted from the Prescribed 
Drug Register, which includes information on all dispensed medication in Sweden since July 
2005.18 The register also collects dispensing data for individuals in all forms of detention, 
including prisons. Following the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification 
system, 4 classes of psychotropic medications commonly used in this sample were selected: 
antipsychotics were defined with ATC code N05A; antidepressants with ATC code N06A; 
psychostimulants with ATC code N06B; and drugs used in addictive disorders with ATC 
code N07B, including nicotine, varenicline, disulfiram, acamprosate, naltrexone, 
buprenorphine, and methadone. Antiepileptic drugs (ATC code N03A), a mixed medication 
class used for treatment of epileptic seizures, neuropathic pain, and mood instability, were

 also included. Adrenergic inhalants (ATC code R03A), a commonly used medication class 
with negligible psychotropic effects, were selected as a negative control.
For each medication class, medication status was treated as a time-varying exposure (ie, 
medication status was not necessarily constant through follow-up), and each individual’s 
follow-up was divided into medicated and nonmedicated periods. In accordance with 
previous studies,9,10 an individual was defined as exposed to medication during the interval 
between 2 dispensed prescriptions, unless prescriptions were issued more than 3 months 
apart. We chose this interval because in routine psychiatric practice, oral medications are 
unlikely to be dispensed for more than 3 months at a time (the so-called 90-day rule in 
Sweden).9 The start of medication was defined as the date of the first prescription, and the 
end of medication was defined as the date of the last prescription. During intervals of 3 
months or longer without any prescriptions, an individual was considered not exposed to 
medication. Each of the medication classes was considered independently, and the same 
systematic analytic strategy was applied.
A second exposure was also investigated: psychological treatment programs provided in 
prison by the SPPS.19 Three types of accredited treatment programs were included, mostly 
introduced and implemented in 2003 and 2004 and commonly used in this sample in group-
based settings: general crime prevention programs (eg, cognitive skills, enhanced thinking 
skills), violence prevention therapies (eg, aggression replacement training, integrated 
domestic abuse program), and psychological treatments for substance abuse (eg, 12-step 
program, relapse prevention) (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Treatment program participation 
was optional but reserved for offenders with medium or high recidivism risk according to the 
risk principle for effective correctional interventions.20 To be accepted, individuals also had 
to understand Swedish or English and have at least 2 to 3 months of their sentence 
remaining. Most programs were translated from original versions in North America or the 
United Kingdom written by authors from both within and outside correctional services.21 
Typically, programs are designed to help motivate offenders to change; accept 
accountability; identify risk factors for their criminal behavior; modify risk factors such as 
impulsivity, criminal attitudes, and drug craving; and reduce reoffending through relapse 
prevention plans when they return to society. The programs had all been introduced after 
recommendation by an accreditation committee of external experts in clinical psychology 
and treatment research. Treatment integrity was ascertained through instructor supervision of 
video recordings of actual program sessions. An individual was considered exposed to a 
treatment program only if the program was completed during the current incarceration 
period. The unexposed group included those who did not attend or complete the studied 
treatment programs.
The main outcome was any conviction for violent crime after release, according to the 
National Crime Register.22 In line with previous work,9 violent crime was defined as 
homicide, assault, robbery, arson, any sexual offense (rape, sexual coercion, child 
molestation, indecent exposure, or sexual harassment), illegal threats, or intimidation. The 
date of the crime was the date of the outcome. If no date of the crime was recorded, the 
conviction date was used instead.

 Several covariates were included: age, sex, immigration status (defined as born outside 
Sweden), sociodemographic factors at the year of release (civil status, highest level of 
completed education, and disposable income), and criminal history factors (duration of 
incarceration, violent index offense [the most serious offense that led to the current prison 
sentence], and any previous violent crime).
For sensitivity analyses, information on lifetime diagnoses of psychiatric disorders was 
obtained from the National Patient Register, which used the International Classification of 
Diseases, Eighth Revision (ICD-8; 1973-1986, codes 290-315), ICD-9 (1987-1996, codes 
290-319), and ICD-10 (1997-2009, codes F00-F99).6
Statistical Analysis
Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs), and medication 
status was treated as a time-varying covariate in all analyses. Violent reoffending could 
occur multiple times during follow-up, with follow-up times reset to 0 after any outcome 
event.10 For each medication class, the association with violent reoffending was examined 
in 2 models. In the first (between-individual) model, rates of violent crime during medicated 
periods were compared with those in nonmedicated periods after prison release among 
released prisoners who had received the specific medication at least once during the study 
period (before, during, or after prison). The analyses were adjusted for age, sex, immigration 
status, sociodemographic factors, and criminal history covariates, and robust standard errors 
were calculated to account for correlations between periods for the same individual. The 
adjusted risk difference was calculated as I0 × (HRa − 1), for which I0 is the unadjusted 
event rate in the unexposed group and HRa is the adjusted HR. Next, stratified Cox 
regression was used to perform within-individual analyses, with each individual entered as a 
separate stratum.9,10,23 That is, each patient served as his or her own control, and rates of 
violent reoffending during medicated periods were compared with rates during non-
medicated periods in the same individuals. The within-individual HRs are thus adjusted for 
confounding by all unmeasured covariates that are constant within each individual during 
the follow-up (eg, genetic predisposition and all environmental factors at the start of follow-
up). Individuals who were invariant with regard to exposure were not excluded, although 
they did not influence the results of within-individual estimates.
To assess the associations between psychological treatment programs in prison and violent 
reoffending, HRs were estimated using Cox regression, with adjustment for age, sex, 
immigration status, sociodemographic factors, and criminological covariates. For each 
treatment program, rates of violent reoffending were compared between people who 
completed the treatment program vs those who did not (or never started) in the full cohort. 
Second, analyses were conducted in subgroups of prisoners to attempt to match programs to 
their indications in a prespecified analytic plan. For general crime prevention programs, the 
analysis was performed in prisoners incarcerated for at least 6 months (long enough to 
complete most programs). For violence prevention, the analysis was conducted in prisoners 
who were incarcerated for at least 6 months and had a violent index offense. For 
psychological treatments aimed at substance abuse, the additional analysis was performed in 
prisoners diagnosed as having substance use disorders.

 Several sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine whether results were altered by 
differences in cohort selection and outcome definition. These analyses were performed only 
with antipsychotics, psychostimulants, and drugs used in addictive disorders because these 
medications were found to be significantly associated with reductions in violent reoffending 
rates. First, the associations were examined in relevant specified diagnostic groups, 
specifically antipsychotics in prisoners diagnosed as having a schizophrenia spectrum 
disorder (ICD-8 codes 295, 297, 298.1-9, and 299; ICD-9 codes 295, 297, 298 [except .A], 
and 299; and ICD-10 codes F20-F29) or bipolar disorder (ICD-8 codes 296.1, 296.3, and 
296.8; ICD-9 codes 296A, 296C-296E, and 296W; and ICD-10 codes F30-31) before prison 
release; psychostimulants in prisoners previously diagnosed as having attention-deficit 
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (ICD-9 code 314; and ICD-10 code F90); and drugs used in 
addictive disorders in those previously diagnosed as having substance use disorders (ICD-8 
codes 291, 303, and 304; ICD-9 codes 291, 292, 303, 304, and 305; and ICD-10 codes F10-
F19). Because of substantial comorbidity,24 antipsychotics were also examined among those 
with substance use disorders, and drugs used in addictive disorders were also tested among 
individuals with a schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder. Second, to test 
whether the associations were different depending on severity of crime, 2 additional 
outcomes were analyzed: (1) severe interpersonal violence, including homicide and 
attempted homicide, all forms of assault (including aggravated assault and assault of an 
officer), rape, sexual coercion, and child molestation25; and (2) any crime (violent and 
nonviolent crime combined). Third, the associations were tested in those treated before 
release and those treated only after release. Fourth, the associations were evaluated in those 
with and without a violent index offense. Fifth, to examine the associations during a longer 
period after release, follow-up time was extended beyond any reincarceration (when any 
subsequent time as a convicted or remanded prisoner was excluded). Sixth, as an indirect 
test of reverse causality, the nonadherence rates of other commonly used medications in 
those who violently reoffended were examined (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
All statistical analyses were performed with SAS version 9.4 statistical software (SAS 
Institute Inc). All tests were 2-sided, and the significance level was set to .05.
Results
The cohort included 22 275 released prisoners in Sweden (mean [SD] age, 38 [13] years; 
91.9% male) from July 1, 2005, to December 31, 2010. Table 1 shows the baseline 
sociodemographic and criminal history information of the full cohort of released prisoners 
(N = 22 275), those with any dispensed psychotropic medications (n = 9915), and those who 
completed any psychological prison programs (n = 5561). The median follow-up time was 
4.6 years (interquartile range, 3.0-6.4 years), and 4031 released prisoners (18.1%) were 
reconvicted for 5653 violent crimes during follow-up. The use of psychotropic medications 
after prison release was common; 2085 individuals (9.4%) were dispensed antipsychotics, 
5660 (25.4%) antidepressants, 1202 (5.4%) psychostimulants, 2077 (9.3%) drugs used in 
addictive disorders, and 2235 (10.0%) antiepileptics (the groups were not mutually 
exclusive; Table 2).

 In the between-individual analyses, there were 100 violent reoffenses during 1590 person-
years of medicated periods with dispensed antipsychotics (a rate of 62.8 per 1000 person-
years), whereas there were 1036 violent reoffenses during 10 941 person-years of 
nonmedicated periods (94.7 per 1000 person-years). The adjusted HR was 0.77 (95% CI, 
0.62-0.96), which equated to a risk difference of 21.7 (95% CI, 3.7-35.9) fewer violent 
reoffenses per 1000 person-years (Figure 1). The adjusted HR associated with dispensed 
psychostimulants was 0.70 (95% CI, 0.56-0.88), which equated to a risk difference of 33.9 
(95% CI, 13.5-49.7) fewer violent reoffenses per 1000 person-years. The adjusted HR 
associated with dispensed drugs for addictive disorders was 0.61 (95% CI, 0.41-0.90), 
equating to a risk difference of 27.5 (95% CI, 7.0-41.6) fewer violent reoffenses per 1000 
person-years. Other medication classes, including antidepressants (HR = 1.04 [95% CI, 
0.90-1.21]), antiepileptics (HR = 1.14 [95% CI, 0.95-1.38]), and adrenergic inhalants 
(negative control; HR = 0.85 [95% CI, 0.60-1.20]), were not associated with any significant 
differences in violent reoffending rates. A small number of individuals (175 of 9915 
individuals who received any psychotropic medications [1.8%]) had missing values on 
sociodemographic factors and were excluded from between-individual analyses.
To account for unmeasured confounders that remained constant within each individual 
during follow-up, rates of violent reoffending were compared in the same individuals during 
medicated vs nonmedicated periods. The within-individual HR associated with dispensed 
antipsychotics was 0.58 (95% CI, 0.39-0.88), based on 100 events in 1596 person-years 
during medicated periods and 1044 events in 11 026 person-years during nonmedicated 
periods, corresponding to a risk difference of 39.7 (95% CI, 11.3-57.7) fewer violent 
reoffenses per 1000 person-years (Figure 2). The within-individual HR associated with 
dispensed psychostimulants was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.40-0.98), based on 94 events in 1648 
person-years during medicated periods and 513 events in 4553 person-years during 
nonmedicated periods, equating to a risk difference of 42.8 (95% CI, 2.2-67.6) fewer violent 
reoffenses per 1000 person-years. The within-individual HR associated with dispensed drugs 
for addictive disorders was 0.48 (95% CI, 0.23-0.97), based on 46 events in 1168 person-
years during medicated periods and 1103 events in 15 725 person-years during 
nonmedicated periods, equating to a risk difference of 36.4 (95% CI, 2.1-54.0) fewer violent 
reoffenses per 1000 person-years. Again, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and adrenergic 
inhalants were not associated with any significant differences in violent reoffending rates 
(HR = 1.09 [95% CI, 0.83-1.43]; 1.14 [95% CI, 0.79-1.65]; and 1.17 [95% CI, 0.62-2.23], 
respectively).
Psychological Treatments
In the full cohort, completion of psychological general crime prevention programs was 
associated with a reduced rate of violent reoffending; violence prevention therapies were 
associated with an increased rate of violent reoffending; and psychological treatments for 
substance abuse were not associated with violent reoffending (Table 3). In subgroup 
analyses that matched programs to their indications, the HR associated with general crime 
prevention programs was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.66-0.90), equating to a risk difference of 11.6 
(95% CI, 5.1-17.1) fewer violent reoffenses per 1000 person-years. The HR associated with 
psychological treatments for substance abuse was 0.75 (95% CI, 0.63-0.89), for a risk

 difference of 23.2 (95% CI, 10.3-34.1) fewer violent reoffenses per 1000 person-years. 
Violence prevention therapies were not significantly associated with violent reoffending. A 
small number of individuals who had missing values on sociodemographic factors (75 of 
5561 individuals [1.3%]) were excluded from the analyses.
Sensitivity Analyses
When examining the effect of psychotropic medications in subgroups of prisoners with 
diagnosed psychiatric disorders, similar estimates were found for antipsychotics in 
individuals diagnosed as having a schizophrenia spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder, for 
psychostimulants in those with ADHD, and for drugs for addictive disorders in those with 
substance use disorders (Table 4). Antipsychotics were not associated with lower rates of 
violent reoffending in those with substance use disorders, whereas drugs used for addictive 
disorders were linked to substantially less violent reoffending in those with a schizophrenia 
spectrum disorder or bipolar disorder. The results were largely comparable when outcomes 
were restricted to severe interpersonal crimes or any crimes (except there was no significant 
association between drugs used in addictive disorders and rates of any criminal reoffending) 
(Table 4). A similar pattern of results was found for those treated before release and those 
treated only after release (Table 4). Similar results were also found when stratifying on index 
offense or extending the follow-up time to beyond the first reincarceration period (Table 4). 
For commonly used nonpsychotropic medications, there was higher nonadherence in those 
who violently reoffended (44.0%) vs those without a violent reoffense (35.7%) (risk 
difference, 8.3% [95% CI, −2.2% to 18.8%]). However, this was not as much as the 
nonadherence rate for psychotropic medications (57.8% for those with a violent reoffense vs 
41.0% for those without a violent reoffense; risk difference, 16.8% [95% CI, 6.2% to 
27.3%]) (eTable 2 in the Supplement).
Discussion
This nationwide longitudinal study of 22 275 released prisoners examined the associations 
between main classes of psychotropic medication and violent reoffending. Unlike previous 
work, this investigation used a within-individual design that more carefully accounted for 
confounding by indication. There were 2 main findings. First, 3 classes of psychotropic 
medications (antipsychotics, psychostimulants, and drugs used in addictive disorders) were 
associated with substantial reductions in violent reoffending. Second, the magnitudes of 
these associations were as strong as and possibly stronger than those for widely 
disseminated psychological programs in prison.
There has been uncertainty about whether treatment for released prisoners with mental 
disorders should focus on criminogenic rather than mental health–related factors.26 The 
current observational study supports the potential role of treating psychiatric disorders, 
including by antipsychotic medication. The latter is consistent with recent findings that 
certain psychotic symptoms27 and untreated schizophrenia28 are associated with higher 
reoffending risk. Further, the findings provide evidence for potential benefits of 
psychostimulants for prisoners at high risk for reoffending. Although the stability of ADHD 
from childhood to adulthood is increasingly recognized,29,30 ADHD remains commonly

 underdiagnosed and undertreated in adults, including prisoners.31 In relation to substance 
use disorders, most intervention research in prisoners has focused on psychological 
treatments.32,33 Randomized clinical trials of pharmacological treatments (eg, methadone 
for opioid dependence) have mostly demonstrated relapse reduction and symptomatic 
improvement.34 The current study suggests that such benefits may extend to lower rates of 
violent reoffending if validated in trials. Owing to the high prevalence of substance use 
disorders among prisoners35 and strong links with premature mortality,36 pharmacological 
treatments for substance use disorders could have a substantial public health benefit.37
The reduction in violent reoffending was not observed for antidepressants or antiepileptics. 
Individuals with depression are less violent than individuals with other mental illnesses38; 
therefore, antidepressants may be less likely than other psychotropic medications to reduce 
violent reoffending. The finding that antiepileptics were not associated with reduced violent 
reoffending was unexpected because they can act as mood stabilizers, which are linked with 
lower rates of violent crime in community settings.9 However, previous work also identified 
important differences by diagnosis; for example, mood stabilizers were associated with 
violent crime reduction only in bipolar disorder.9 Thus, the lack of any association in this 
study is likely explained by heterogeneity in their use, including for chronic pain, seizures, 
and epilepsy.
Secondary analyses demonstrated that completion of psychological treatments targeting 
general criminal attitudes and substance abuse was associated with reductions in violent 
reoffending. Further, the associations with these psychological programs were not stronger 
than those for medications. These findings may have implications for risk management, 
because prison psychological programs need appropriate facilities, require sufficiently 
trained and supervised therapists, and are likely to be relatively expensive. Provision of 
medication after prison release needs evaluation as a possibly cost-effective crime reduction 
alternative. Because prisoners with psychiatric disorders benefit from both pharmacological 
and psychological treatments, research should investigate whether combining therapies 
improves outcomes.39
This study has a number of limitations. Randomized clinical trials in this field are rare owing 
to feasibility issues, and recruiting, obtaining consent from, and following up participants 
are considerable logistic challenges. Pharmacoepidemiologic studies offer an alternative 
approach with large and representative samples.9 However, unlike randomized clinical trials, 
they cannot account for all possible confounders that select individuals to treatment. One 
approach taken in the current study was to restrict one of the main analyses to individuals 
who had ever used medications from the studied medication class. Associations were further 
evaluated by within-individual analyses, an approach that accounted for all confounding 
factors remaining constant in each individual. Nevertheless, unmeasured time-varying 
confounding or reverse causality cannot be ruled out. For example, factors that could 
motivate individuals to use medications may be the same factors that influence them to not 
reoffend, or some factors that cause persons to resume their violent activities might also lead 
them to be nonadherent to their medications. These alternative explanations were 
investigated in secondary analyses. First, the different directions in the associations between 
different classes of psychotropic medications and violent reoffending would argue against

 this. If confounding were a major factor, then similar associations between all classes of 
medications and violent reoffending would be expected. Similarly, if engagement with the 
health care system was a key explanation, similar reduction across all classes of medication 
would be expected, which was not demonstrated. Second, no association between adrenergic 
inhalants (as negative control) and violent reoffending was seen. Third, violent reoffending 
was associated with higher rates of nonadherence for all categories of medication, but not as 
much as the nonadherence rate for psychotropic medications. Taken together, it was unlikely 
that unmeasured confounding or reverse causality could fully explain the observed 
associations. Nevertheless, observational studies like this one cannot prove causality. 
Validation with other samples and triangulation with other designs are necessary.
There are other limitations to consider. First, exposure to medication was measured using 
dispensed prescriptions, which does not account for poor medication adherence. If some 
individuals did not use medications as intended, it would bias the results toward null and 
mean that our findings are likely to be conservative estimates. Second, the data were not 
sensitive enough to investigate the effects of active symptoms or disease phase.28 Third, the 
analyses cannot account for all possible confounders that select individuals to prison-based 
programs. Caution is thus warranted in interpreting these results. Fourth, the findings were 
based in 1 country. Although Sweden has a low incarceration rate,1 some key prisoner 
characteristics are similar to those in other high-income countries (eg, prevalence of 
psychiatric disorders, reoffending rate, and duration of incarceration).6 At the same time, we 
tested the robustness of the main results and found reduced hazards for violent reoffending 
in prisoners prescribed antipsychotics, psychostimulants, and drugs used for addictive 
disorders when we restricted the cohort to individuals who had committed violent offenses 
on prison entry or prisoners prescribed these medications only after prison release, and we 
reported similar associations when we extended follow-up beyond first reincarceration.
The absolute numbers of prisoners with psychiatric disorders are large worldwide, and most 
individuals who could benefit from psychotropic treatment do not receive it after prison 
release.37 The magnitudes of the associations reported in this study may warrant 
correctional services to review policies for released prisoners. Evidence-based provision of 
psychotropic medications to released prisoners may have the potential to make substantial 
improvements to public health and safety, particularly in countries that are undergoing 
decarceration.
Conclusions
Among released prisoners in Sweden, rates of violent reoffending were lower during periods 
when individuals were dispensed antipsychotics, psychostimulants, and drugs for addictive 
disorders, compared with periods in which they were not dispensed these medications. 
Further research is needed to understand the causal nature of this association.

 Key Points
Question
Is the use of psychotropic medications associated with a lower risk of reoffending for 
violent crime among released prisoners?
Findings
In this cohort study of 22 275 released prisoners, 3 classes of psychotropic medications 
(antipsychotics, psychostimulants, and medications used for addictive disorders) were 
associated with statistically significant hazard ratios (0.58, 0.62, and 0.48, respectively) 
of violent reoffending.
Meaning
Evidence-based provision of psychotropic medications to released prisoners was 
associated with lower risk of reoffending.

Hazard ratios were adjusted for age, sex, immigration status, sociodemographic factors, and 
criminal history covariates. The same individuals could have both medicated and 
nonmedicated periods. Individuals in the nonmedicated periods included persons who never 
received medication after prison release, and a small number of persons in the medicated 
periods were likely receiving medication the entire duration after release.
