Background: Hydrochlorothiazide, one of the most frequently used diuretic and antihypertensive drugs in
the United States and Western Europe, is photosensitizing and has previously been linked to lip cancer.
Objective: To examine the association between hydrochlorothiazide use and the risk of basal cell
carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).
Methods: From the Danish Cancer Registry, we identified patients (cases) with nonmelanoma skin cancer
(NMSC) during 2004-2012. Controls were matched 1:20 by age and sex. Cumulative hydrochlorothiazide
use (in 1995-2012) was assessed from the Danish Prescription Registry. Using conditional logistic
regression, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) for BCC and SCC associated with hydrochlorothiazide use.
Results: High use of hydrochlorothiazide ($50,000 mg) was associated with ORs of 1.29 (95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.23-1.35) for BCC and 3.98 (95% CI, 3.68-4.31) for SCC. We found clear dose-response
relationships between hydrochlorothiazide use and both BCC and SCC; the highest cumulative dose
category ($200,000 mg of HCTZ) had ORs of 1.54 (95% CI, 1.38-1.71) and 7.38 (95% CI, 6.32-8.60) for BCC
and SCC, respectively. Use of other diuretics and antihypertensives was not associated with NMSC.
Limitations: No data on sun exposure were available.
Conclusions: Hydrochlorothiazide use is associated with a substantially increased risk of NMSC, especially
SCC. ( J Am Acad Dermatol 2018;78:673-81.)

 Nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most
common cancer in humans, and the incidence is
increasing, particularly among the elderly.1 Exposure
to ultraviolet (UV) light and a UV-susceptible skin
phenotype have been established as important risk
factors for NMSC. In addition, the use of immunosup-
pressants (eg, cyclosporine and azathioprine) induces
NMSC, and other drugs have
been suggested to either in-
crease (eg, topical and sys-
temic calcineurin inhibitors)
or decrease (eg, aspirin and
other
nonsteroidal
anti-
inflammatory drugs) the risk
of NMSC.2-5
Recently, we reported a
strong association between
use of the diuretic hydrochlo-
rothiazide (HCTZ) and squa-
mous cell carcinoma (SCC) of
the lip.6 We found a clear
dose-response pattern, with
an estimated 7-fold increased
risk of SCC lip cancer with cumulative use of
100,000 mg or more of HCTZ. Our findings were in
line with the results of previous studies from the
United States7 and the recent classification of HCTZ as
possibly carcinogenic to humans (group 2B) by the
International Agency for Research on Cancer.8 As
HCTZ is among the most widely used drugs in the
United States and Western Europe,9 a carcinogenic
effect of HCTZ would have a considerable impact on
public health.
Few studies have investigated the association be-
tween thiazide use and NMSC risk.10-13 Although the
study results have been inconsistent, they indicate
that HCTZ use increases the risk of NMSC. Some of the
inconsistencies may derive from difficulties in disen-
tangling the effect of HCTZ from that of other
antihypertensives, as HCTZ is mainly prescribed in
combination with other diuretics (primarily amilor-
ide) or nondiuretic antihypertensives.10-13 Therefore,
we were interested in examining the association
between HCTZ use and NMSC risk more extensively
and evaluating the individual effect of HCTZ.6
Specifically, we used detailed data from the Danish
demographic, prescription, and disease registries to
examine the association between HCTZ use and the
risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or SCC of the skin.
METHODS
We performed a nested case-control analysis
based on nationwide registry data. We compared
HCTZ use among persons in whom SCC and BCC of
the skin had been diagnosed with that of cancer-free
population controls and estimated odds ratios (ORs)
for SCC and BCC associated with previous HCTZ use.
Data sources
We obtained data from 5 nationwide data sources:
the
Danish
Cancer
Registry,14
the
National
Prescription
Registry,15
the
National
Patient
Registry,16
the
Danish
Education
Registers,17 and
the Danish Civil Registration
System.18 We linked all data
sources
using
the
unique
civil registration number as-
signed to all Danish resi-
dents. Details of codes used
to define drug exposure and
covariates have been pro-
vided elsewhere.6
Selection of patients with
NMSC
The patients with NMSC
were Danish residents with
histologic verification of their first diagnosis of SCC
or BCC of the skin between January 1, 2004, and
December 31, 2012. We excluded patients with SCC
of the lip, as they were evaluated in our previous
study.6 We required patients to have no previous
skin or other cancer diagnoses before the first
diagnosis of BCC or SCC (index date) and to have
resided in Denmark for at least 10 consecutive years
before the index date. We also required patients to
have no record of organ transplantation; HIV diag-
nosis; or use of azathioprine, cyclosporine, or
mycophenolate mofetil, as immunosuppressive dis-
ease and therapy may predispose to skin cancer.2,19
We defined the date of the first skin cancer diagnosis
as the index date.
Population controls
Controls were selected by risk-set sampling. For
each case, we matched 20 population controls by sex
and birth year, applying the same selection criteria as
for cases. Controls were allotted the index dates of
their corresponding cases. As individuals were
eligible to be controls before they became case
patients, the calculated ORs provide unbiased esti-
mates of the incidence rate ratios that would have
emerged from a cohort study based on the source
population.

 HCTZ-containing drug before the index date and
never use as no HCTZ-containing prescription. In
Denmark, HCTZ is prescribed almost exclusively as a
part of combination preparations with potassium-
sparing diuretic amiloride or nondiuretic antihyper-
tensives,
predominantly
angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antag-
onists. The content of HCTZ was identified in all
combination or single drugs dispensed to individuals
in the study population, and on the basis of this
information the cumulative dose of HCTZ to which
each individual had been exposed up to index date
was calculated. High use of HCTZ was defined as
filled prescriptions equivalent to 50,000 mg or more
of HCTZ, corresponding to 2000 or more defined
daily doses (ie, ;6 years of cumulative use).
Prescriptions filled within 2 years before the index
date (lag time) were disregarded, primarily to allow a
reasonable induction period for an effect on BCC or
SCC risk and to guard against the possibility that
medical attention before the skin cancer diagnosis
had influenced the decision to prescribe HCTZ.20
Other variables
We defined potential confounders on the basis of
the following data: (1) use of selected drugs with
suggested photosensitizing properties, including
oral retinoids, topical retinoids, tetracycline, macro-
lides, aminoquinolines, amiodarone, and methox-
ypsoralene10,13,21,22; (2) use of drugs with suggested
antineoplastic effects, including aspirin, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, and statins3; (3) composite
measures of hospital diagnoses and disease-specific
drugs defining medical histories of diabetes, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic renal insuf-
ficiency, or conditions associated with heavy alcohol
consumption (see the Supplemental and Sensitivity
Analyses; available at http://www.jaad.org); (4)
Charlson comorbidity index scores (0, low; 1-2,
medium; or $3, high) derived from the prevalence
of 19 chronic conditions; and (5) highest achieved
education (basic, medium, higher, or unknown).
Exposure to each potential confounder drug was
defined as 2 or more prescriptions on separate dates,
and the hospital history of each of the selected
medical conditions was defined as a primary or
secondary discharge or outpatient diagnosis. For all
covariates,
we
disregarded
information
within
2 years before the index date.
Analyses
All analyses followed a conventional matched
case-control approach. We computed the frequency
and proportion of cases and controls within cate-
gories of the exposure and covariates. We used
conditional logistic regression analysis to compute
ORs with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the
association of BCC or SCC with HCTZ use adjusted
for the predefined potential confounders. In addi-
tion, to examine potential dose-response relation-
ships, we stratified analyses according to predefined
categories of cumulative HCTZ use. The statistical
significance of the dose-response pattern was as-
sessed by restriction to HCTZ ever users and
estimation
of
the
incremental
OR
for
each
10,000 mg of HCTZ by using ordinary logistic
regression while also adjusting for sex and age as a
continuous variable. In all analyses, BCC and SCC
were analyzed separately, and those with never use
of HCTZ served as the reference group unless stated
otherwise. We performed a number of preplanned
supplementary
analyses,
as
outlined
in
the
Supplemental and Sensitivity Analyses.
Ethical approval
The Danish Data Protection Agency and Statistics
Denmark’s Scientific Board approved the study.
According to Danish law, ethical approval is not
required for registry-based studies.
Software
All analyses were performed using STATA Release
14.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX).
RESULTS
The study population comprised 71,533 case
patients with BCC and 8629 case patients with SCC
(Fig 1) who were matched with 1,430,883 and
172,462 population controls, respectively. Baseline
characteristics were generally similar between case
patients and controls, except that the BCC case
patients were slightly better educated than the
controls (Table I).
Overall, 2.7% of the BCC case patients and 2.1% of
the controls were high users ($50,000 mg) of HCTZ,
yielding an adjusted OR of 1.29 (95% CI, 1.23-1.35)
for BCC. The corresponding OR for SCC was 3.98
(95% CI, 3.68-4.31) based on high use of HCTZ in
10.0% of case patients and 2.8% of controls. Clear
dose-response relationships were observed with

 HCTZ use for both BCC and SCC, with the highest
ORs observed in the upper exposure category
($200,000 mg) (BCC: OR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.38-1.71,
test for trend P \.001; SCC: OR, 7.38; 95% CI, 6.32-
8.60, test for trend P \.001 [Table II and Fig 2]). The
proportion of skin cancers attributable to HCTZ use
(ie, attributable proportion, see Methods) was 0.6%
for BCC and 9.0% for SCC.
Little variation was seen in the association be-
tween HCTZ use and BCC or SCC risk in the
subgroup analyses, except for notably stronger
associations among younger individuals and females
(Table II). In analyses stratified according to tumor
localization, we observed stronger associations for
cancers at sun-exposed skin sites, especially the skin
of the lower limbs (Table III).
We found no associations for BCC or SCC risk with
use of other diuretics and other hypertensives,
including bendroflumethiazide, calcium channel
blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
angiotensin II receptor antagonists, furosemide,
indapamide, or nifedipine, neither overall or accord-
ing to the cumulative use of the individual drugs (see
Supplemental Tables I-VII in the Supplemental and
Sensitivity Analyses).
In analyses excluding ever use of amiloride, HCTZ
use exhibited dose to response relationships with the
risk of BCC or SCC similar to those in the main
analysis
(Supplemental
Table
VIII
in
the
Supplemental and Sensitivity Analyses), though
small numbers precluded analyses of cumulative
HCTZ use in excess of 100,000 mg.
DISCUSSION
In this large nationwide study including more
than 70,000 patients with BCC and 8000 patients with
SCC, we found a substantially increased risk of
NMSC, particularly SCC, associated with HCTZ use.
We observed clear dose-response patterns for both
BCC and SCC, with a more than a 7-fold increased
risk of SCC for a cumulative use of 200,000 mg or
more of HCTZ. In addition, for both BCC and SCC,
the associations with HCTZ use became stronger
with increasing lag time before diagnoses. Assuming
causality, the present results suggest that 1 of 11 SCC
cases diagnosed during the study period can be
attributed to HCTZ use. The increased risk of BCC
and SCC appeared to be specific for HCTZ use
among a range of examined drugs with similar
indications.

 size based on high-quality nationwide registries
including prescription data, medical conditions,
and skin or other cancer diagnoses. Use of the
Prescription
Registry
yielded
complete
and
detailed long-term information on use of HCTZ
or other drugs during an exposure period of up to
18 years.15 Cancer diagnoses obtained from the
Cancer Registry were restricted to histologically
verified cases, further enhancing validity.14
This study also had some limitations. Most impor-
tantly, we did not have information on 2 major risk
factors for BCC and SCC, namely, UV exposure and
skin phenotype. However, we find it unlikely that
sun habits would be markedly different between
users and nonusers of HCTZ. We had no information
on ethnicity or skin type; however, the majority of
Danes are of white origin. Still, information on UV
exposure and skin phenotype would have been
useful in evaluating photosensitivity as the explan-
atory mechanism for an increased skin cancer risk
with HCTZ use.
Severe skin photosensitivity reactions to HCTZ use
have been reported.23,24 In a recent survey of US
dermatologists, patients with multiple SCC tumors
reported a frequent history of HCTZ use.25 However,
only a few observational studies have investigated the
association between HCTZ use and NMSC risk.10-13
A Dutch study reported no association between

 the use of thiazides (including HCTZ) and NMSC
risk,11 whereas a US study found that the use of
diuretics overall was significantly associated with an
increased risk of BCC.26 The apparent discrepancy in
the results of some previous studies and our findings
are likely attributable to differences in exposure
definition (HCTZ vs all thiazides) and outcomes
(SCC vs BCC or NMSC only). A recent study from
the United States found a relation between thiazide
use and risk of SCC, but it did not present results for

 individual thiazides.27 Only 2 previous studies re-
ported results specifically for HCTZ. A Danish study
observed an increased risk of SCC, but not BCC, with
the use of HCTZ alone and in combination with
amiloride. However, this study had a limited exposure
period and relatively small sample size based on only
1 of 5 Danish regions, thus precluding detailed
analyses of cumulative HCTZ use.12 A more recent
study from the same region also noted an increased
risk of SCC associated with using the combination of
HCTZ and amiloride. However, the association was
not further explored and no dose-response analyses
were presented.10
SCC was more strongly associated with HCTZ
use than was BCC, which is in line with the
evidence that cumulative UV exposure plays a
larger role in the etiology of SCC than of BCC.1
Furthermore, the observed associations varied ac-
cording to body site and were stronger for the
limbs than for the trunk, which is compatible with
the notion that the increased NMSC risk associated
with
HCTZ
use
is
mediated
through

 photosensitizing effect. The difference in associa-
tions according to sex may be related to differ-
ences in skin thickness (ie, women have a thinner
layer of both epidermis and dermis than men)28
and sun habits (ie, women are more frequent
tanners than men),29 which may confer a differ-
ence in susceptibility to the effects of photosensi-
tizing exposure.
The associations with HCTZ use also varied
according to age, with the highest ORs for both
BCC (1.91) and SCC (42.85) observed among
persons younger than 50 years. The stronger
association
among
the
youngest
subjects
strengthens the argument for a photosensitizing
effect. The decrease in ORs (ie, a measure of
relative risk) with increasing age may also reflect
that NMSC risk increases with age for other reasons
(eg,
accumulation
of
DNA
breaks
and
immunosenescence).
Lastly (and in line with our previous study), we
found no association between the use of other
antihypertensive drugs and NMSC risk.6 In addition
to the strength of the observed associations, the
specificity of HCTZ use with increased risk of BCC
and SCC supports the potential causal association
between HCTZ use and NMSC risk.
In conclusion, given the considerable use of
HCTZ worldwide and the morbidity associated
with NMSC, a causal association between HCTZ
use and NMSC risk would have significant public
health implications. The use of HCTZ should be
carefully considered, as several other antihyperten-
sive agents with similar indications and efficiency are
available, but without known associations with skin
cancer.

 SUPPLEMENTAL AND SENSITIVITY
ANALYSES
First, we repeated the main analyses for other
diuretic
drugs
with
suggested
photosensitizing
properties,
including
bendroflumethiazide
and
furosemide.10,12,13 Next, we performed analyses
for other antihypertensives, including angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotesin II recep-
tor blockers, and calcium channel blockers. In the
analyses of other diuretics and nondiuretic antihy-
pertensives, associations were adjusted for hydro-
chlorothiazide
(HCTZ)
use.
In
addition,
we
excluded ever-users of amiloride from the main
analyses to obtain risk estimates for basal cell
carcinoma (BCC) and squamous cell carcinoma
(SCC) with HCTZ use exclusive of amiloride (pri-
marily preparations of HCTZ and angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotesin II re-
ceptor blockers). On the basis of the results from
the categoric dose-response analyses, the attribut-
able proportion of HCTZ use for BCC and SCC
(assuming causality) was estimated by adding the
single steps in the dose-response analysis together
(estimated as attributable proportion = (odds ratio �
1)/odds ratio). Finally, we examined associations
between HCTZ use and BCC or SCC risk according
to tumor localization, categorized as skin of the head
and neck, skin of the trunk, skin of the upper limb,
skin of the lower limb, and unspecified part of the
skin.
