Abstract
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a ubiquitous viral pathogen associated with large-scale morbidity
and mortality in humans. However, there is considerable uncertainty over the time-scale of
its origin and evolution. Initial shotgun data from a mid-16th century Italian child mummy,
that was previously paleopathologically identified as having been infected with Variola virus
(VARV, the agent of smallpox), showed no DNA reads for VARV yet did for hepatitis B virus
(HBV). Previously, electron microscopy provided evidence for the presence of VARV in this
sample, although similar analyses conducted here did not reveal any VARV particles. We
attempted to enrich and sequence for both VARV and HBV DNA. Although we did not re-
cover any reads identified as VARV, we were successful in reconstructing an HBV genome
at 163.8X coverage. Strikingly, both the HBV sequence and that of the associated host mito-
chondrial DNA displayed a nearly identical cytosine deamination pattern near the termini
of DNA fragments, characteristic of an ancient origin. In contrast, phylogenetic analyses
revealed a close relationship between the putative ancient virus and contemporary HBV
strains (of genotype D), at first suggesting contamination. In addressing this paradox we
demonstrate that HBV evolution is characterized by a marked lack of temporal structure.
This confounds attempts to use molecular clock-based methods to date the origin of this
virus over the time-frame sampled so far, and means that phylogenetic measures alone can-
not yet be used to determine HBV sequence authenticity. If genuine, this phylogenetic pat-
tern indicates that the genotypes of HBV diversified long before the 16th century, and
enables comparison of potential pathogenic similarities between modern and ancient HBV.
These results have important implications for our understanding of the emergence and evo-
lution of this common viral pathogen.

 Author summary
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) exerts formidable morbidity and mortality in humans. We used
ancient DNA techniques to recover the complete genome sequence of an HBV from the
mummified remains of a child discovered in the 16th century from Naples, Italy. Strik-
ingly, our analysis of this specimen resulted in two contrasting findings: while the damage
patterns lend credence to this HBV sequence being authentically 16th century, phyloge-
netic analysis revealed a close relationship to recently sampled viruses as expected if the
sequence were a modern contaminant. We reconcile these two observations by showing
that HBV evolution over the last ~450 years is characterized by a marked lack of temporal
structure that hinders attempts to resolve the evolutionary time-scale of this important
human pathogen.
Introduction
The comparative analysis of viral genomes provides a wide and informative view of evolution-
ary patterns and processes. In particular, viruses often evolve with sufficient rapidity to inform
on evolutionary processes over the timespan of direct human observation (weeks and days)
[1–3]. Importantly, recent technical developments in next generation sequencing [4, 5] and
ancient DNA (aDNA) recovery [6] have enabled the rigorous study of nucleotide sequences
from increasingly older historical, archaeological and paleontological samples. Consequently,
aDNA sequences can now facilitate the study of more slowly evolving pathogen populations,
from which recent samples display limited sequence diversity, by permitting an expansion
of the indirectly observable timespan to that of centuries [7, 8]. Hence, viral and bacterial
genomes recovered from such ancient samples have the potential to reveal the etiological
agents associated with past pandemics, as well as important aspects of the long-term patterns
and processes of evolutionary change within pathogen populations.
To date, investigations of ‘ancient’ viruses have been limited in number and scope. Those
focusing on pathogens sampled prior to 1900 have considered four human viruses: variola
virus (VARV, the agent of smallpox) [8, 9], human papillomavirus [10], human T-cell lympho-
tropic virus [11], and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [12, 13]. Similarly, aDNA techniques have been
used in studies of major 20th century epidemics of influenza virus and human immunodefi-
ciency virus [14, 15]. Taken together, these studies have helped to clarify the causative agents
of specific outbreaks, whether ancient strains differ markedly from recent ones, and the evolu-
tionary and epidemiological processes that have likely shaped virus diversity. Moreover, they
have provided key information on the dynamics of evolutionary change, including the ‘time-
dependent’ nature of viral evolution in which estimates of evolutionary rates are routinely ele-
vated toward the present and decline toward the past due to a combination of unpurged tran-
sient deleterious mutations in the short-term and site saturation in the long-term [16].
A major challenge for any study of aDNA is the accumulation of post-mortem damage in
the genome of interest. This damage includes fragmentation, nucleotide deamination, and
polymerase-blocking lesions, such as molecular cross-linking, resulting from enzymatic and
chemical reactions [17–19]. Certain environmental conditions, including desiccation of or-
ganic material and low ambient temperatures, can inhibit the activity of some endonucleases
and environmental microorganisms, although oxidative and hydrolytic processes will con-
tinue to occur in all conditions at variable rates depending on the preservational context [20].
However, the predictably recurring forms of damage, such as the tendency for cytosine

 deamination to occur more often near the 3’ and 5’ ends of fragmented DNA molecules, also
provide a means of addressing questions of contamination and inferring the authenticity of a
recovered sequence through statistical pattern analysis [21].
For rapidly evolving genomes, such as those from viruses, phylogenetic analysis can provide
another means of establishing provenance. In particular, as the rate of evolutionary change is
high in many viruses [22], “ancient” viruses should generally fall closer to the root of a tree
than their modern relatives. However, a complicating factor is that any phylogenetic inference
that aims to determine evolutionary rates or time-scale is only meaningful when the virus in
question exhibits clear temporal structure in the phylogeny, such that it is evolving in an
approximately clock-like manner over the time-scale of sampling. Because DNA viruses gener-
ally exhibit lower rates of evolutionary change than RNA viruses [22], such populations tend
to require larger sampling time-frames to discern temporal structure and clock-like behavior
[16].
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) (family Hepadnaviridae) presents a compelling case of the com-
plexities of analyzing the evolution of DNA viruses. Despite considerable effort, the evolution-
ary rate and time of origin of this important human pathogen remain uncertain, even though
it is chronically carried by approximately 350 million people globally, with almost one million
people dying each year as a result [23]. Particularly puzzling is that although HBV utilizes an
error-prone reverse transcriptase (RT) for replication, estimates of its evolutionary rate are
generally low, yet also highly variable. For instance, mean rate estimates of 2.2 × 10−6 nucleo-
tide substitutions per site per year (subs/site/year) have been derived from long-term studies
utilizing internal node calibrations on phylogenetic trees built using conserved regions of the
viral genome [24], while rates of up to 7.72 × 10−4 subs/site/year have been recorded within a
single patient [25] and pedigree-based studies have returned mean rates of 7.9 × 10−5 subs/site/
year [26]. As the highest evolutionary rates are observed in the short-term, this pattern is con-
sistent with both relatively high background mutation rates and a time-dependent pattern of
virus evolution in which rates are elevated toward the present due to incomplete purifying
selection [16].
HBV is also genetically diverse, comprising ten different genotypes designated A–J, as well
as additional subgenotypes within genotypes A–D and F [27]. Intra-genotypic sequence differ-
ences average 8%, while subgenotypes differ by an average of 4% [28, 29]. The HBV genotypes
differ in their geographic distributions. Genotype A is most prevalent in northwestern Europe
and the United States, while genotypes B and C predominate in Asia, and genotype D in the
Mediterranean basin, including Italy, as well as the Middle East and India. Similarly, genotype
E is mostly seen in west Africa, genotype F in South and Central America, genotype G in the
USA and France, and genotype H in Mexico and South America [30]. The more recently
described genotype I has been identified in Vietnam [31] and Laos [32], while the one example
of genotype J was isolated from a Japanese sample [33].
With over half of the nucleotide coding for more than one protein, the physical constraints
of the HBV genome are likely to have a major impact on evolutionary dynamics. Partially dou-
ble-stranded, the relaxed-circular DNA genome averages ~3200 bp in length for the longer
strand and ~1700–2800 for the shorter, comprised of four overlapping open reading frames
(ORFs). These ORFs encode seven proteins; the pre-core and core proteins, three envelope
proteins (small, medium, and large S), the reverse transcriptase (RT, the polymerase), and an
X protein that is thought to mediate a variety of virus-host interactions [34, 35]. As noted
above, the replication of HBV involves the use of RT, an enzyme that has no associated proof-
reading mechanism, such that mutational errors are expected to be frequent [25, 36]. However,
due to the overlapping ORFs, many mutations are likely to be non-synonymous and therefore
purged by purifying selection.

 Considerable uncertainty remains as to when HBV entered human populations and when
it differentiated into distinct genotypes. Given its global prevalence and the presence of related
viruses in other mammals including non-human primates, it is commonly believed that the
virus has existed in human populations for many thousands of years [37]. Further, recent stud-
ies have shown that the long-term evolutionary history of the Hepadnaviridae is shaped by a
complex mix of long-term virus-host co-divergence and cross-species transmission [38].
Hence, it seems reasonable to conclude that HBV diversified within geographically isolated
human populations following long-term continental migrations [24].
Ancient DNA has the potential to provide a new perspective on the evolutionary history of
HBV. Notably, HBV has been sequenced from a Korean mummy radiocarbon dated to 330
years BP (±70 years) which translates to ca.1682 (with an error range of 1612–1752) [12]. Phy-
logenetic analysis of this sequence (GenBank accession JN315779) placed it within the modern
diversity of genotype C, which is common to Asia. This phylogenetic position is compatible
with low long-term rates of evolutionary change in HBV such that the virus has existed in
human populations for many thousands of years, with genotypes diversifying over this time-
scale [24]. However, the authenticity of this sequence, and hence the evolutionary time-scale it
infers, remains uncertain, as deamination analysis and read length distribution were not
reported as the data were generated using PCR based methodologies. In addition, as genotype
C is common in modern Asian populations [37] and the mummy sequence (JN315779) clus-
ters closely with modern sequences, there is no phylogenetic evidence to support the historical
authenticity of this sequence.
For aDNA to resolve the origins of HBV it is of paramount importance to determine
whether ancient samples can be used to calibrate the molecular clock to provide more accurate
estimates of the time-scale of HBV origins and evolution. To this end, we report the detailed
study of a complete HBV genome sampled from a 16th century Italian mummy.
Results
A 16th century mummy from the Basilica of Saint Domenico Maggiore,
Naples, Italy
We sampled the remains of an unidentified child mummy, approximately two years of age,
found in the sacristy of the Basilica of Saint Domenico Maggiore in Naples, Italy, and exhumed
between 1983 and 1985 [39] (Fig 1). This mummy is described in previous studies as mummy
no. 24 (NASD24) [40]. Radiocarbon (14C) dating indicates that this mummy is 439 years old
(± 60 years), thereby placing it to 1569 CE ± 60 years [39]. Evidence from the funerary context,
including the dress style [41, 42], particularities of the mummification technique, and the
known identities and historical records of other mummies, agree with this time frame [39, 40].
Shotgun analysis of a suite of mummified remains from this site showed that one of the
remains, those of NASD24, yielded sequence reads mapping closely to viral sequences from
the Hepadnaviridae (Table 1, S1 Table).
Prior to the deposition in a coffin on a suspended passageway of the sacristy, the body of
mummy NASD24 was eviscerated and embalmed. Records indicate the mummy was left
undisturbed from 1594 [40]. Notably, the autopsy identified a diffuse vesiculopustular rash on
the arm, body and face [40]. Paleopathological interpretation of this rash identified it as evi-
dence of a possible smallpox infection. Electron microscopic images produced in an earlier
study of pustular tissue homogenates from this mummy showed egg-shaped, dense structures,
and positive results in immunostaining with protein-A/gold complex of ultrathin sections of
pustular skin incubated with human anti-vaccinia-virus antiserum supported the presence of a
poxvirus [43]. However, in our study, we also attempted SEM analysis of the tissue samples of

dimensions, though did discover particles consistent with an unknown viral origin (S1 Fig).
We are uncertain how mummification (or later processes involved in preservation and prepa-
ration for EM analysis) may have affected the physical appearance of viral particles.
aDNA extraction, library preparation, enrichment and sequencing
We extracted total DNA from samples of the distal femur, skin attached to a rib, skin attached
to the frontoparietal bone, thigh muscle, temporo-maxillary skin, and leg skin of mummy
NASD24 (Table 2) using a modified organic phenol-chloroform-isoamyl method [44] in dedi-
cated aDNA facilities at McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada. These extracts were con-
verted into double-stranded (ds) Illumina indexed sequencing libraries both with and without
uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) treatment and enriched for HBV, VARV, and mitochondrial
genomes using in-solution bait sets. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 1500
platform. We generated a total of 1,041,774 reads for the UDG-treated LM01 library (distal
femur) and 3,869,248 for the non-UDG-treated LM01 library (Table 2). Of the trimmed and

 merged reads (minimum 30 base pairs in length), 4,338 unique reads mapped to HBV D3
genotype X65257 from the UDG-treated library and 4,360 from the non-UDG-treated library.
A smaller number of reads mapped to X65257 from other samples (Table 2). A total of 9610
reads from the distal femur, the skin attached to the rib and the fronto-parietal bone, the thigh
muscle, the temporo-maxillary skin and the leg skin were pooled for further analysis using a
consensus sequence (Table 2, S1 Table).
We first mapped all next-generation sequencing reads to the HBV reference genome (Gen-
Bank accession number NC_003977) using a dedicated aDNA pipeline [8] (Table 2, S1 Table).
Using BLAST, as well as an initial phylogenetic analysis of a sequence data set representing the
genotypic diversity of HBV (Fig 2, S2 Table), the consensus of the draft HBV genome was

 identified as a subgenotype D3 virus. This subgenotype has a broad global distribution and is
common in the Mediterranean region, including Italy [30]. To ensure a proper consensus we
remapped all reads to a subgenotype D3 HBV (GenBank accession number X65257). In addi-
tion we mapped all reads to the revised Cambridge reference sequence (rCRS) for human
mtDNA (GenBank accession number NC_012920 [45]) and identified the consensus as hap-
logroup U5a1b (S3 Fig). Haplogroup U5 is common in European populations and U5a1b is
most commonly found in Eastern European populations but is also frequently seen in the
Mediterranean region, including in Greek, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish populations [46].
The HBV genome used in all evolutionary analyses was assembled after pooling all the
reads from the rib with skin, fronto-parietal bone with skin, thigh muscle, temporo-maxillary
skin, leg skin, and the distal femur both with and without UDG treatment. This consensus
genome is 3,182 nt in length and with a gap in the genome of 177 nt (positions 1427–1603) near
the 5’ end of the X ORF and in the region of overlap with the polymerase ORF (S2 Fig). This
gap is likely due to low bait coverage because of locally high G/C strand imbalance affecting
oligo production, rather than the existence of a true biological gap due to a deletion. The first 5
nucleotides of the sequence mapped to X65257 were marked as ambiguous, as were the last 36.
A damage analysis of the mapped reads (using the mapDamage 2.0 program [47]) from the
subsamples with and without UDG treatment revealed an authentic post-mortem damage pat-
tern, as expected for an ancient sample (Fig 3, S4 Fig). If deamination had occurred within the
lifespan of an infected host (for instance, as a result of deamination induced by human enzyme
APOBEC–known to induce deamination in certain viruses), then we would expect to have
seen deamination spread more evenly throughout the viral reads. Instead, deamination has
preferably occurred at the termini of DNA fragments as seen in the non-UDG treated subsam-
ples (Fig 3A). As nearly identical patterns were observed with the mitochondrial reads, this
suggests to us that the HBV DNA is more likely to be of the same age as the mtDNA than it is
to be derived from a recent contaminant (Fig 3B). As expected, following treatment with
UDG, viral reads do not display the deamination pattern, suggesting that the UDG did indeed
remove uracils from the DNA fragments (S4 Fig) [48].
Attempts to enrich VARV DNA
As it has been previously been suggested that the rash observed in this mummy is the direct
result of a smallpox infection [43], we enriched for VARV using an in-solution bait set previ-
ously published [8]. Importantly, we were unable to find a single significant read mapping to
the VARV genome (S1 Table). Although we cannot conclusively exclude the presence of
VARV in this sample, this result does not lend credence to the presence of any VARV DNA
when compared to the successful enrichment of HBV DNA, unless VARV is far more sensitive
to degradation post mortem than HBV is, which does not agree with our recent success at
enrichment of VARV from a Lithuanian child mummy [8].
Evolutionary analysis of Italian HBV aDNA
We compiled two primary data sets representing (a) the full genotypic diversity of HBV and
(b) that of D genotype alone (Table 3). These consisted of publicly available HBV sequence
data from GenBank with the additions of the HBV genome newly sequenced here (NASD24-
SEQ) and that previously obtained from a Korean mummy (JN315779) (S2 Table). No evi-
dence of recombination was found within either ancient sequence. While there was evidence
for recombination in some modern sequences, equivalent results were found in evolutionary
analyses conducted with and without these sequences, indicating that recombination has not
had a major impact on the phylogenetic results presented here.

notype collected between 1985 and 2008 with 100% bootstrap support, falling on the branch
separating D3 from the D1 and D2 subtypes (Fig 4). Similarly, JN315779 fell within the genetic

 Importantly, NASD24SEQ occupied similar phylogenetic positions within subgenotype D3
when phylogenies were inferred separately for the overlapping and non-overlapping regions of
the HBV genome, as well as for the polymerase ORF alone (S5 Fig). Hence, there is no evi-
dence that the grouping of NASD24SEQ with modern subgenotype D3 sequences is a function
of genome overlap.
The sequence recovered from this 16th century Italian mummy therefore occupies a para-
doxical phylogenetic position: although it exhibits legitimate signs of DNA damage, consistent
with both the pattern seen in the mitochondrial reads and an ancient origin, it clusters closely
with modern HBV sequences, as might be expected if it were a recent contaminant. If the
NASD24SEQ sequence is bona fide, then the only reasonable explanation is that our data set
representing the last 450 years of HBV evolution is of insufficient duration to exhibit temporal
structure, in turn implying that HBV has a long evolutionary history in humans with ancient
diversification times of the different viral subtypes. To test this hypothesis, we performed a
detailed analysis of HBV evolutionary dynamics, focused on addressing whether the evolution
of this virus presents sufficient temporal structure for molecular clock dating.
To help determine the veracity of our ancient HBV sequence, we performed a series of anal-
yses using both root-to-tip regression [49] as well as those within a Bayesian framework [50].
These analyses employed various calibrations, including collection dates for modern samples,
radiocarbon-dating estimates of ancient samples, and viral co-divergence with human popula-
tion migration.
Data sets must possess temporal structure for tip-dated analyses to be informative [51]. We
first assessed for temporal structure using a regression of root-to-tip genetic distances against
year of sampling [49]. Strikingly, neither of the primary data sets (subsets a and b), with or
without inclusion of ancient sequences, showed evidence of any temporal structure, with R2
values of 8.98 × 10−4 (a-ii) and 2.78 × 10−2 (b-i), respectively (Fig 5), as was true of the other
genomic data sets (S6 Fig). Similarly, no temporal structure was observed in the D3 subgeno-
type, both without (R2 = 2.85 × 10−2) and with NASD24SEQ (R2 = 2.90 × 10−2) (S7 Fig). To
further assess the extent of temporal structure, we employed a Bayesian date-randomization
test in which the nucleotide substitution rate is estimated using the correct sampling dates
(see below), and the analysis then repeated 20 times on data sets in which the sampling dates
have been randomized among the sequences [52]. Notably, for both ancient sequences
(NASD24SEQ and JN315779), the 95% higher posterior density interval (HPD) of the rate
overlapped between the true and randomized data for both the modern and complete (includ-
ing ancient) data sets (Fig 6 and S8 Fig). This indicates that there is insufficient temporal struc-
ture in HBV to performed tip-date-based analyses of evolutionary dynamics, even when
including sequences that date to the 16th century.
Because of the lack of temporal structure from tip-dated calibrations, we next specified an
informative prior distribution on the clock rate using a previous estimate of the long-term
substitution rate of HBV at 2.2 × 10−6 subs/site/year [24]. The aim here was to estimate the
ages of NASD24SEQ and JN315779 and determine whether these estimates matched the dates
inferred from radiocarbon dating of the mummies and tomb materials. To this end, we tested
(i) a prior of 2010 on the ages of both modern and ancient samples, such that no true sampling
dates were considered, (ii) a uniform prior on the age of the ancient samples with a lower
bound of 0.0 and an upper bound of 10,000 years before present, and (iii) a normal prior
matching the radiocarbon dates. For both the ‘modern’ prior of 2010 and the uniform prior
calibrations we expect that the posterior will differ from the prior if the rate calibration and the
molecular sequence data are informative about the ages of the samples. Importantly, the inclu-
sion of this long-term substitution rate as a clock calibration resulted in estimated ages for the
ancient samples that were very similar to each of the priors tested in each case (S9A Fig).

 Hence, the molecular sequence data and rate calibration do not have sufficient information to
estimate the age of these sequences.
Similarly, we attempted to estimate the sampling times of NASD24SEQ and JN315779
under the assumption that HBV has co-diverged with human populations. Internal node cali-
brations can be more informative than tip calibrations when no temporal structure can be
ascertained using sampling dates [51, 53]. Accordingly, we used the same calibration scheme
as Paraskevis et al. 2015, in which human migration dates were used to specify the prior distri-
butions of ages on nodes from HBV subgenotypes found in endemic populations [24]. Our
analysis using subset a-ii yielded a mean rate estimate of 6.84 × 10−6 subs/site/year (95% HPD:
4.46 × 10−6 to 9.26 ×10−6 subs/site/year), which is considerably lower than some previous esti-
mates [25]. Critically, however, the age estimates for the ancient samples again matched the
uniform prior distributions (S9B Fig). Therefore, even with internal node calibrations, the
sequence data and calibrations were not sufficiently informative to estimate the age of these
viral sequences.
Finally, we employed a second set of internal node calibrations in which the node separat-
ing the F and H genotypes from the rest of the HBV tree had a normal prior with a mean of
16,000 years and a standard deviation of 1000 years. This follows a study that estimated that
humans may have entered the Americas about 16,000 years ago, a more specific date than that
estimated in earlier papers [54]. Using this more precise calibration, our analysis resulted in a
mean rate estimate of 4.57 ×10−6 subs/site/year (95% HPD: 2.62 × 10−6 to 6.96 ×10−6 subs/site/
year) similar to that obtained from the node calibrations employed above. The mean ages of
the ancient samples were accordingly estimated at 214 years for JN315779 (95% HPD: 23 to
398) and 276 years (95% HPD: 29, 505) for NASD24SEQ (Fig 7). However, due to the very
wide uncertainty in these estimates, which again closely resemble the prior distributions, these
results do not provide posterior estimates that are conclusive on the age of the HBV samples.
Discussion
We have enriched and sequenced a complete HBV genome from the remains of a mummified
child estimated to have died in 1569 CE ± 60 years [39]. The cytosine deamination patterns
occurring preferentially at termini in both the viral and mitochondrial DNA fragments sup-
port the ancient authenticity of these sequences. We have also subtyped the mitochondrial
DNA from the mummy to haplogroup U5a1b, a common European haplogroup [46], and the
HBV to genotype D, a genotype predominant in the Mediterranean region today [30]. The
nearly identical fragment length distributions, deamination patterns and same geographically
recovered haplotypes (mitochondrial and HBV) argue for the authenticity of the sequences.
The identification of consistent HBV reads in multiple (5) tissue samples (distal femur, fronto-
parietal bone with skin, thigh muscle, temporo-maxillary skin and leg skin; Table 2), suggests
that the virus is distributed throughout the mummy and not in one location, as might be
expected with contamination. Further, other mummies from the same site, excavated at the
same time and processed in the same facilities, did not show any HBV reads in shotgun
sequencing data. Thus, if the mummy was contaminated, it was specific to this one sample
alone. Although hepadnaviruses like HBV exhibit strong tropism for liver cells (hepatocytes),
hepadnaviral DNA has been shown to exist in other somatic cells, including mononuclear
cells, which are protected by the hydroxalite matrix of the bone [55–57]. HBV particles pro-
duced in the bone marrow and protected by the matrix may explain why we recovered the
majority of our viral sequences from a femur sample. DNA isolated from ancient bone matrix
has also been shown to be better preserved and less damaged than that recovered from corre-
sponding soft tissue from the same remains [58].

 Many reports of ancient epidemics and other disease outbreaks have relied upon historical
reporting and paleopathological studies of human remains. Recent advances, including next
generation sequencing technology [5] and DNA enrichment methods [6], now allow recovery
of ancient nucleotide sequences from these remains and the genetic verification of the patho-
gens responsible for disease, as well as the identification of pathogens undetectable by other
means. Our study provides a strong argument for this latter approach, as mummy NASD24
was originally reported to have been infected with smallpox [40, 43]; crucially, however,
shotgun sequencing following enrichment for VARV (S1 Table) and SEM analysis (S1 Fig)
revealed no evidence of VARV in this mummy. This is particularly surprising given previous
results in which electron microscopy studies and immunostaining indicated the presence of

 VARV particles in these samples [43]. Given our results, a new interpretation is that the child
was not suffering from smallpox at the time of death, but rather Gianotti-Crosti syndrome
caused by HBV infection [59]. Gianotti-Crosti syndrome is a rare clinical outcome of HBV that
presents as a papular acrodermatitis in children between 2 and 6 years old [59]. This, in turn,
illuminates the power of aDNA in providing definitive evidence or clarifying retrospective diag-
noses, where etiology may be uncertain and morphology complicated for key type specimens
that provide critical time points for the origins or presence of specific pathogens (e.g. smallpox).
Despite the multiple streams of evidence supporting an ancient origin of NASD24SEQ, the
results of the evolutionary analysis are less straightforward. In particular, our phylogenetic anal-
ysis reveals a close relationship between NASD24SEQ and modern D genotype sequences, as
would be expected if the sequence were a modern (1980s) contaminant, and we note the same
phenomenon with the Korean mummy sequence thought to date from the 17th C [12]. Impor-
tantly, however, data sets representing only modern HBV sequences, sampled over 50 years to
the present, did not display discernible temporal structure. Clearly, without temporal structure
we cannot accurately estimate the age of the ancient sequences using phylogenetic methods.
Hence, the apparently paradoxical phylogenetic position of NASD24SEQ cannot automatically
be taken to mean that this genome is a modern contaminant. In turn, if NASD24SEQ is indeed
from the 16th century, then this phylogenetic pattern indicates that the diversification of the
HBV genotypes occurred prior to 1500 and that any subsequent accumulation of diversity was
either lost through strong purifying selection or masked by multiple substitutions.
Our analyses of both modern and ancient HBV samples returned results consistent with
the absence of temporal structure, not only within the full diversity of HBV but also within the
D genotype and D3 subgenotype. Given that the genomic structure of HBV is likely to result
in strong selective constraints, a likely explanation for our results is that many of the mutations
that arise in the short-term, such as within chronically infected hosts or along single chains of
transmission, are non-synonymous and eventually removed from the HBV population by
purifying selection, yet artificially inflating evolutionary rates over this sampling period [60].
Support for this hypothesis comes from short-term studies of HBV evolution in which rates of
evolutionary change are greater than those estimated from longer-term studies [24, 25].
On balance, our analysis suggests that our HBV sequence is authentically 16th century and
that no temporal structure is observable in over 450 years of HBV evolution. As such, these
results have a number of important implications for the study of HBV evolution. In particular,
such a phylogenetic pattern implies that the currently circulating viral genotypes must have
been associated with their specific host populations long before the 16th century, and hence
supports a long association of HBV with human populations. In addition, the lack of temporal
structure means that it is not possible to use molecular clock methods to reliably date HBV
evolution over the time span of genome sequences currently available.
Materials and methods
Sample history
Exploration of the coffin and the autopsy of the unidentified two-year old mummy (NASD24)
was completed as part of a larger study, conducted between 1984 and 1987, of mummies
from the sacristy of the Basilica of Saint Domenico Maggiore in Naples, Italy. Autopsies were
performed for all mummies by paleopathologists wearing sterile surgical coats, sterile latex
gloves, sterile masks, headdresses and overshoes. Details of this initial investigation have been
reported previously [40].
The samples used for aDNA sequencing were collected during the initial autopsies, and
these samples were stored in sealed, sterile plastic bags. The sample bags were first opened in

 1985 for a preliminary paleopathological examination that suggested a viral agent, thought to
be smallpox, as the likely cause of an apparent skin rash [40]. The samples were handled again
in 1986 for examination by immune-electron microscopy [43]. After this, the samples
remained in sterile storage before subsamples were removed and sent to the McMaster
Ancient DNA Centre at McMaster University (Hamilton, Ontario, Canada) in 2013.
Ethics approval
Ethical approval to work on this mummy sample was granted to Dr. Fornaciari by the Supervi-
sor for the Artists and Historians of Campania in 1984.
aDNA library preparation, enrichment and sequencing
Eight subsamples of 75–125 mg of organic matter were excised from samples of various body
parts of NASD24 in a dedicated cleanroom facility at the McMaster Ancient DNA Centre
(Table 1). Tissue samples were cut into small pieces using a scalpel and bone material crushed
into powder. These samples were then demineralized, digested, and extracted according to
previously published protocols [44]. In brief, samples were demineralised using 1.5 mL of
EDTA (0.5 M, pH 8.0) before being incubated at room temperature for 24 hours with rotation
at 1000 rpm. Samples were then digested using a 1.5 mL proteinase K solution and incubated
at 55˚C for 6 hours with rotation at 1000 rpm. The supernatant from the demineralization and
digestion steps was subjected to organic extraction using a modified phenol-chloroform-isoa-
myl (PCl) alcohol protocol. This means that 0.75 mL of PCl (25:24:1) was added to the demin-
eralization/digestion supernatant, which was then vortexed, and spun via centrifuge (4000×g)
for 20 minutes. The aqueous phase was transferred to a fresh tube and a further 0.75 mL of
chloroform added. The solution was mixed and spun via centrifuge (4000×g) for 10 minutes.
The aqueous phase was collected and concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 0.5 mL 30 kDa fil-
ter. This concentrated solution was purified over a MinElute column (Qiagen, Hilden, Ger-
many) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluted in 10 μL of 0.1 TE with 0.05%
Tween-20. Reagent blanks were introduced at each step and processed alongside the samples.
A library from the distal femoral sample of NASD24 was prepared according to a previously
published protocol [61] that was modified to include an overnight ligation and with an input
volume of 5 μL. Double indexing was performed using KAPA SYBR FAST (Kapa Biosystems)
for 8 cycles of indexing amplification [62]. The library and blanks were enriched using two
rounds of in-solution capture baits targeting HBV and the human mitochondrial genome (in
separate reactions) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Mycrorarray, MyBaits) with
recommended aDNA modifications. Baits, of 80nt in length with 4x tiling density (10nt flexi-
ble spacing), were designed based on the sequences of 5,230 HBV sequences, representing all
major viral subtyptes. Template input was 5 μL for each reaction and bait concentrations were
100 ng per reaction using the in-solution bait mix targeting HBV and 50 ng per reaction for
that targeting human mtDNA. Target genetic material was reamplified for 12 cycles both
between and after rounds of enrichment. The HBV-enriched library generated 1,934,624 clus-
ters (3,869,248 raw reads) and the human mtDNA-enriched library generated 2,844,500 clus-
ters (5,689,000 raw reads) on an Illumina HiSeq 1500 at the Farncombe Metagenomics Facility
(McMaster University, Hamilton Ontario, Canada).
Sequence data trimming, analysis and assemblies
Reads were demultiplexed using CASAVA-1.8.2 (Illumina, San Diego, California), then adapt-
ers were trimmed and reads merged using leeHom [63] with aDNA specific settings (—
ancientdna). These processed reads were mapped to an appropriate reference genome (HBV

 genotype D3, GenBank accession X65257; revised Cambridge Reference Sequence for human
mtDNA, GenBank accession number, NC_012920) using a network-aware version of the Bur-
rows-Wheeler Aligner [64] (https://bitbucket.org/ustenzel/network-aware-bwa) with distance,
gap and seed parameters as previously described [8]. Duplicates were removed based on 5’ and
3’ positions (https://bitbucket.org/ustenzel/biohazard). Reads shorter than 30 base pairs and
with mapping quality less than 30 were removed using Samtools [65]. The resulting BAM files
were processed using mapDamage 2.0 on default settings with plotting and statistical estima-
tion [47]. Haplogrep v2.1.0 [66] using PhyloTree Build 17 [67] was used to identify the hap-
logroup of the mtDNA as U5a1b. The complete genome sequence of NASD24 has been
submitted to GenBank and assigned accession number MG585269.
Data set assembly
We analyzed the ancient HBV sequenced in this study in the context of modern whole-
genomes of HBV. To this end we downloaded all human HBV genomes from GenBank that
were over 3,000 nt in length and for which the year of sampling was available (all date informa-
tion, including month and day, if available, was converted into decimal format). This initial
GenBank data set comprised 3,696 sequences sampled between 1963 and 2015 (S2 Table).
Sequences were aligned with the MAFFT v7 program using the FFT-NS-1 routine [68] to visu-
ally check for obvious errors in database labeling.
For initial genotypic subtyping, one representative of each HBV subtype was selected (S3
Table). This data set included the purportedly ancient HBV sequence previously obtained
from a 17th century Korean mummy (GenBank accession number JN315779; radiocarbon-
dated to 1682 with an error range of 1612–1752 [12]). The subtype of NASD24SEQ was
inferred from maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic trees estimated using PhyML v3.0 [69]
with the GTR+Г4 model of nucleotide substitution and employing SPR branch-swapping, with
nodal support assessed by conducting 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates.
Following this, a random subsample of HBV sequences was taken using the Ape package in
R [70]. Specifically, we sampled five representatives of each genotype and subtype, or the maxi-
mum number available if this was not five. This produced a data set of 135 sequences sampled
between 1963–2013 which we refer to as subset a (Table 3, S4 Table). We then added the
ancient Italian HBV sequence NASD24SEQ to subset a to make data set a-i with n = 136. A
third subset was built by adding the ancient Korean HBV sequence JN315779 to a-i to make
subset a-ii with n = 137. We next randomly sampled only D genotype sequences from the ini-
tial GenBank data set to form subset b with n = 64 (S5 Table). To this we added NASD24SEQ,
generating subset b-i with n = 65. We aligned the nucleotide sequences in each subset using
the L-INS-i routine in MAFFT v7.
Recombination analysis
The RDP, GENECOV, and MAXCHI methods available within the RDP v4 package [71], with
a window size of 100 nt (and default parameters), were used to analyze each subset for recom-
bination. If at least two methods detected recombinant regions in a sequence, then we
removed the region of recombination from the alignment.
Phylogenetic analysis
Following removal of recombinant regions, we inferred phylogenetic trees on each subset (of a
and b) again using the ML method in PhyML v3.0 [69] with the GTR+Γ4 model of nucleotide
substitution and employing SPR branch-swapping, and with nodal support assessed by con-
ducting 1000 non-parametric bootstrap replicates.

 Assessing the temporal structure of HBV
We conducted a range of analyses to assess the extent of temporal structure in the data sets
and to estimate the rate and time-scale of HBV evolution. To initially verify the temporal struc-
ture in the data we conducted regressions of root-to-tip genetic distance as a function of the
sampling time (year) using TempEst v0.1 [49]. We then conducted a date-randomization test
[52]. This involved analyzing the data using the Bayesian method implemented in BEAST
v1.8.3 [50] under a lognormal relaxed clock model [72] and assuming a constant population
size, with 20 replicates in which the sampling dates were randomized among the sequences.
The HBV data were considered to have temporal structure if the mean rate estimate and 95%
HPD intervals were not contained within the 95% HPD of any of estimates resulting from the
randomized data sets [52]. All analyses were run with an Markov chain Monte Carlo chain
length of 107 steps with samples from the posterior distribution drawn every 2 × 103 steps.
After discarding the first 10% of steps as burn-in, we assessed sufficient sampling from the pos-
terior by visually inspecting the trace file and ensuring that the effective sample sizes for all
parameters were at least 200.
We also performed more detailed Bayesian estimates of evolutionary dynamics. One
method of validating the ages of ancient samples is to specify uninformative prior distributions
for these and test if the tip dates or an informative rate give the postulated ages. Specifically, if
the sequence data and calibrations are informative, the posterior should consist of a narrow
distribution that includes the true sampling time of the ancient samples [73]. However, if the
prior and posterior distributions for the ages of the ancient samples are the same, then the data
are considered to have insufficient information to estimate the ages of these samples. We con-
ducted these analyses by setting uniform distributions for the two ancient samples between 0
and 107 with a mean of 105. For the Korean sample we set a uniform prior with upper and
lower bounds of 400 and 0, whereas for the Italian sample we used 507 and 0, with the maxi-
mum values in both cases reflecting their presumed sampling date. We also conducted analyses
in which, for the Italian sample, we set a normal truncated prior distribution with the upper
and lower values at 507 and 387, and mean of 447 and standard deviation of 10, whereas for
the Korean sample we used 400 and 260 for the bounds, and 330 and 35 for the mean and stan-
dard deviation, respectively. These numbers are based on the radiocarbon dating analysis, with
the upper and lower values reflecting the error margins.
We employed three calibration strategies for these analyses. (i) First, we used the sampling
times of the modern samples, but with a uniform prior for the rate bounded between 0 and 1.
(ii) Second, we assumed that all the modern samples were contemporaneous, and specified
internal node calibrations, corresponding to those used by Paraskevis et al. (2015) and Llamas
et al. (2016) [36, 54] and assuming that the spread of HBV corresponds to that of early human
populations [24, 36]. These consisted of setting normal priors for the time of the most recent
common ancestor (tMRCA) of F and H genotypes at 16,000 years, with a standard deviation of
1000, setting the tMRCA for subgenotype B6 at 3500 years with a standard deviation of 3000,
and setting the tMRCA for subgenotype D4 at 8500 years with a standard deviation of 3500.
(iii) Finally, we calibrated the molecular clock by specifying an informative prior for the mean
(long-term) substitution rate of HBV based on the estimate by Paraskevis et al. (2013) [24].
Accordingly, the prior was in the form of a normal truncated prior with mean of 2.2 × 10−6
sub/site/year, standard deviation of 5 × 10−7, and lower and upper bound of 1.5 × 10−6 and
3 × 10−6, respectively. We again used the GTR+Γ4 nucleotide substitution model for these
analyses, although a codon-partitioned HKY model was also considered within the internally
calibrated analysis.
