Most animals alternate periods of feeding with periods of fasting often coinciding with sleep. Upon >24 hr of
fasting, humans, rodents, and other mammals enter alternative metabolic phases, which rely less on glucose
and more on ketone body-like carbon sources. Both intermittent and periodic fasting result in benefits
ranging from the prevention to the enhanced treatment of diseases. Similarly, time-restricted feeding
(TRF), in which food consumption is restricted to certain hours of the day, allows the daily fasting period
to last >12 hr, thus imparting pleiotropic benefits. Understanding the mechanistic link between nutrients
and the fasting benefits is leading to the identification of fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) that achieve
changes similar to those caused by fasting. Given the pleiotropic and sustained benefits of TRF and
FMDs, both basic science and translational research are warranted to develop fasting-associated interven-
tions into feasible, effective, and inexpensive treatments with the potential to improve healthspan.
Introduction
Life forms on our planet have evolved under the strong influence
of a daily light/dark cycle. With sunlight as the primary source of
energy for photosynthesis, the daily production of photosyn-
thetic biomass has a predictable diurnal rhythm. The daily
cyclical production of photosynthesized chemical energy is at
the base of the food chain. Daily changes in light and darkness
result in diurnal rhythms in other environmental parameters
such as temperature and humidity. Such a predictable and
robust daily rhythm in food availability and environmental factors
has led to the evolution of an �24 hr internal timing mechanism or
circadian rhythm to enable organisms to anticipate daily
changes and to optimize fitness. Fundamental to this 24 hr
rhythm is the ability to acquire food when it is available and to
store a portion of these resources for utilization during the rest
of the day (i.e., the fasting period) without compromising fitness
and vitality. The fasting period also serves as a time for standby
and repair so that the organism is fit and competent to harvest
energy when light (for photosynthetic organisms) or food be-
comes available. While many non-photosynthetic lifeforms with
short lifespan (< a few days) may not derive profound benefit
from a circadian timing system, they share fundamental
biochemical mechanisms for acquiring and storing food when
it is available and then utilizing this stored energy during a quies-
cent period of fasting for repair, stress resistance, and vitality.
Inherent to this alternating cycle of feeding and fasting (irre-
spective of circadian rhythm-proficient or circadian rhythm-
deficient organisms) is the theory that ‘‘fasting physiology’’
(biochemical processes associated with fasting) is triggered
once stored energy is being utilized and therefore does not occur
during the feeding period. This theory also highlights the notion
that certain aspects of repair and rejuvenation that are integral
to fasting-re-feeding physiology may be associated only with
fasting. Hence, intermittent and periodic fasting may represent
important factors in optimizing lifespan and healthspan. In circa-
dian rhythm-deficient organisms, the optimal duration of fasting
(i.e., one that avoids a low energy state that compromises
viability) depends on the extent of stored nutrients and ambient
conditions. These simple organisms have made tremendous
contributions to the experimental dissection of molecules and
mechanisms of cell-autonomous fasting physiology that is
conserved across species. In circadian rhythm-proficient organ-
isms, the inherent circadian oscillator has programmed a natural
cycle of feeding and fasting that occurs with �24 hr periodicity.
However, even oscillator-proficient organisms have retained
mechanisms to adapt to a few days of reduced or no energy
intake without substantial loss of vitality. As a result, the oscil-
lator-proficient organisms can benefit from sustained daily
rhythms as well as from periodic fasting of several hours.
Reducing energy intake on a daily basis, as in caloric restriction,
may allow the fasting physiology to be triggered sooner and to be
sustained for longer periods of time than when consuming stan-
dard or excessive amounts of calories. Similarly, restricting the
timing of food intake to a few hours without an overt attempt to
reduce caloric intake, as in time-restricted feeding (TRF), may
trigger the fasting physiology after a few hours of feeding cessa-
tion on a daily basis. In summary, these arguments highlight the
relevance of fasting physiology within the energy-restriction or
time-restriction paradigms.
Modern humans face complex health challenges and solu-
tions. While prevention, vaccination, and treatment for infectious
diseases have prolonged lifespan, the presence of artificial light
enables human activity throughout the 24 hr day. This disrupted
activity-rest cycle indirectly disrupts the natural daily cycle of
feeding and fasting, and facilitates excessive caloric intake.
Such chronically disrupted temporal regulation contributes to
metabolic diseases and may also accelerate the aging process.
Treating for metabolic diseases has been challenging, as the
traditional pharmacological approach to disease management
may not be sufficient. Long-term chronic pharmacological

 interventions have been particularly successful when the phar-
macological molecule is a replacement of an essential biochem-
ical agent, such as insulin (for type 1 diabetes), thyroid hormone,
vitamins, or minerals, that is deficient. These replacement agents
often have multiple modes of actions and exert pleiotropic
effects. If daily, alternate daily, or periodic fasting can promote
healthy lifespan by exerting pleiotropic effects, restoring a fast-
ing period or switching to a diet that mimics fasting may be an
effective treatment strategy for several chronic diseases.
Historical and Evolutionary Arguments for the Safety
and Potential Efficacy of Periodic Fasting in Health and
Longevity
The emergence at major university hospitals around the world of
complementary and integrative medicine centers that utilize
nutrition, exercise, yoga, and acupuncture to prevent and treat
disease is evidence that the medical field is sampling traditional
interventions to discover ways of improving and replacing FDA-
approved therapies involving peptides, antibodies, and pharma-
ceuticals (Rakel, 2012). Many standard-of-care therapies are
based on the discovery of enzymes, receptors, or other targets
that mediate biological effects of interest, followed by the identi-
fication of specific drugs or biologicals that interfere with or
enhance the activity of specific targets. Although processes by
which the drug target and drug are identified are highly sophisti-
cated, resulting intervention (e.g., the inhibition of cholesterol
synthesis by statins or the damage of DNA by chemotherapy
drugs) can be viewed as rather unsophisticated strategies. In
the case of statins, the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis does
not take into account long-term effects of the accumulation of
cholesterol precursors or counteracting mechanisms by which
the human body is capable of synthesizing more cholesterol. In
the case of chemotherapy drugs, the obvious collateral damage
to non-cancerous cells is clear evidence of the lack of sophisti-
cation involved. It is therefore not surprising that years after
a drug’s initial FDA approval, which is supposedly based on
demonstrated efficacy, a wide range of side effects, as well
as evidence for limited efficacy, often emerge. Undoubtedly, a
more detailed understanding of the underlying causes of dis-
ease, and the undesirable short- and long-term consequences
of standard therapies, could lead to more effective and safer
drugs. One promising alternative or complement to pharmaceu-
tical interventions is to identify dietary and traditional remedies
that have been safely utilized for hundreds of years to trigger
sophisticated physiological responses resulting from billions of
years of evolution. These evolutionary and historical arguments
are scientifically meaningless, unless accompanied by (1) in-
sights into their molecular mechanisms of action, (2) extensive
and unbiased cellular and animal data, (3) epidemiological data,
and (4) randomized clinical trials.
Among alternative interventions for the prevention and treat-
ment of chronic metabolic diseases, different forms of fasting
and fasting-mimicking diets (FMDs) have the greatest potential
of being integrated into the standard medical care. These range
from TRF, feeding every other day (alternate day fasting), adopt-
ing a reduced calorie regimen twice a week (5:2 fasting), or un-
dergoing a periodic cycle of diets that provide a relatively high
caloric content but are able to mimic many of the effects of fast-
ing (FMDs).
Here we will review the evolutionary origins of fasting-related
health benefits by examining the response of microorganisms
to starvation and the mechanisms by which nutrients affect
cellular protection and longevity. We will then describe how
different forms of fasting affect the health and/or longevity of ro-
dents and humans. The focus will be both on efficacy and safety.
Model Organisms and Mechanisms: Chronic and
Periodic Fasting
The entry into fasting physiology that allows organisms to
respond and adapt to starvation conditions first appeared in pro-
karyotes billions of years ago. This response represents one of
the most potent examples of comprehensive cellular reprogram-
ming and appears to be functioning in virtually all organisms
(Longo and Mattson, 2014). Bacteria and baker’s yeast,
switched from rich medium to NaCl or water, respectively, sur-
vive several fold longer, and the removal of bacteria from the
worm’s medium causes a major lifespan extension (Fabrizio
and Longo, 2003; Kaeberlein et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2008). The
network of genes and mechanisms responsible for these starva-
tion responses are perhaps best understood in the unicellular
S. cerevisiae, whose chronological lifespan is doubled when all
nutrients are removed from the medium.
The two central dietary components that block the starvation
response in yeast and whose removal results in lifespan exten-
sion and stress resistance are amino acids and glucose. In
particular, serine activates Pkh/PDK signaling, and threonine
and valine activate Tor signaling. Both of these pathways
converge on the serine/threonine kinase Sch9, the yeast ortho-
log of mammalian S6 kinase (Figure 1) (Mirisola et al., 2014).
Other amino acids, including methionine, have been implicated
in the reduced protection and longevity of S. cerevisiae (Rucken-
stuhl et al., 2014). Glucose, on the other hand, activates the Ras,
adenyalate cyclase, PKA pathway. Subsequently, the glucose
and amino acid pathways converge to inactivate the serine/
threonine kinase Rim15, which, in turn, positively regulates at
least three major stress-resistance transcription factors: Msn2,
Msn4, and Gis1 (Figure 1). Therefore, when glucose and amino
acids are removed from the medium as part of the switch from
rich medium to water, these protective transcription factors are
activated and regulate a wide range of stress-resistance and

oxidative damage, switching from a glucose- and mitochon-
dria-dependent mode in which ethanol and acetic acid are accu-
mulated to a mode in which acetic acid and ethanol are utilized
for energy, and glycerol plus trehalose are produced (Hu et al.,
2014). This starvation-dependent reprogramming of the yeast
metabolic pathways is reminiscent of the fasting-dependent
switch from a glucose-driven oxidative phosphorylation to a ke-
tone bodies and fatty acid-dependent metabolism in mammals,
which is also associated with the generation of glycerol. The
mechanisms of starvation-dependent lifespan extension in yeast
are still not fully understood, but because they largely depended
on the activity of transcription factors Msn2, Msn4, and
Gis1, they are likely to be, in part, dependent on the increased
expression of genes involved in the heat-shock response as
well as antioxidant genes SOD1 and SOD2, but also on the
reduced generation and/or concentration of superoxide and
other toxic molecules. One of the consequences of the inhibition

 of Tor-S6K signaling by fasting is the activation of autophagy,
which is known to play an important role in aging and lifespan (Ei-
senberg et al., 2009; Madeo et al., 2010).
In future studies, it will be important to understand how starva-
tion conditions affect the ability of yeast to repair and replace
damaged organelles and macromolecules. The simplicity of uni-
cellular eukaryotes is likely to continue to yield fundamental new
ideas and provide more in-depth mechanistic insights that accel-
erate research in higher eukaryotes. Studies in worms and flies
will also be important to bridge the understanding of the molec-
ular biology of fasting in yeast and mammals.
Fasting and Fasting-Mimicking Diets in Rodent Diseases
and Longevity
There are two major forms of fasting studied in rodent models:
intermittent fasting (IF), which usually refers to a water-only or
very low calorie period lasting less than 24 hr and followed by
a normal feeding period of 1–2 days, or periodic fasting (PF),
which lasts 2 or more days and is separated from the next cycle
by at least 1 week (Longo and Mattson, 2014).
The role of IF in aging and diseases in rodents is still controver-
sial. In rats, multiple studies indicate that every other day fasting
consistently extends lifespan and that this effect is more pro-
nounced than that caused by fasting for 1 day every 3–4 days
(Carlson and Hoelzel, 1946; Kendrick, 1973). However, mouse
studies using different genetic backgrounds indicate that IF
can have no effect on mean lifespan and may even reduce life-
span when started at 10 months of age (Goodrick et al., 1990).
Even when the IF was started at 1.5 months, the effects on
longevity were minor and not consistent (Goodrick et al., 1990).
However, in rodents IF enhances cognitive performance (Fon-
ta
´ n-Lozano et al., 2007; Singh et al., 2012), which may be caused
in part by its stimulatory effect on synaptic plasticity (Lee et al.,
Figure 1. Conserved Nutrient-Sensing
Pathways in Yeast and Mice
2006), and also improves insulin sensi-
tivity and reduces blood pressure and
heart rate (Mager et al., 2006; Wan
et al., 2003).
Whereas periodic and prolonged fast-
ing has been studied extensively in bac-
teria, yeast, and worms (Longo and Matt-
son, 2014), its role in the longevity and
health of rodents is only beginning to be-
ing
investigated.
Because
water-only
fasting leads to rapid weight loss in
mice, Brandhorst et al. developed a low
protein, low sugar, and relatively high
fat content FMD lasting 4 days and
providing between 10% and 50% of the
normal caloric, which achieved effects
on markers for aging and diseases similar
to those caused by a water-only fast last-
ing 2–3 days (Brandhorst et al., 2013,
2015). When mice, starting at 16 months
of age, were switched to the 4-day FMD
twice a month, they lost body weight and particularly visceral
fat, even though they consumed the same level of calories per
month as mice in the control diet group. Notably, this effect
was not accompanied by a loss of lean body mass relative to to-
tal abdominal volume (Brandhorst et al., 2015). Neoplasms were
reduced by approximately 45%, and their detection was delayed
by approximately 4 months. Furthermore, the abnormal lesions
were mostly detected in two or fewer organs, indicating that
many of the neoplasms were either benign tumors or not aggres-
sive cancers (Brandhorst et al., 2013). These results are in agree-
ment with the effects of fasting in retarding the growth of a wide
range of tumors and in enhancing the toxicity of chemotherapy
drug to cancer cells (Lee and Longo, 2011; Safdie et al., 2012)
while protecting normal cells (Raffaghello et al., 2008; Tinkum
et al., 2015). Inflammation, and in particular dermatitis, was
reduced by 50% when the entire lifespan period was considered.
After 4 months of FMD treatment, white blood cell number in the
FMD group mice was similar to that of 4-month-old mice and
nearly three times higher than in the age-matched mice on the
control diet (Figure 2) (Brandhorst et al., 2015), in agreement
with demonstrated effect of PF cycles in promoting a hematopoi-
etic stem-cell-dependent regeneration of immune cells, leading
to a rejuvenated immune phenotype (Cheng et al., 2014).
Seven months of FMD cycles also resulted in improvements in
a battery of behavioral tests ranging from motor coordination to
long- and short-term memory compared to mice on the standard
control diet (Figure 2) (Brandhorst et al., 2015). The effect of the
FMD on neurogenesis, possibly by the downregulation of IGF-1
and PKA signaling, indicates that the generation of new and
functional neurons may contribute to the enhanced cognitive
performance in FMD-treated mice, in agreement with the effects
of PF, IGF-1, and PKA on hematopoietic regeneration (Cheng
et al., 2014).

 Not surprisingly, the FMD cycles started at 16 months of age
caused an 18% increase in the 75% survival point, and an
11% increase in the mean lifespan. Notably, after 24 months of
age mice appeared to be negatively affected by the 4-day
FMD, but not by an identical FMD reduced to 3 days, in agree-
ment with results on protein restriction, indicating that young,
but not old, mice can maintain a normal weight when protein
intake contributes to less than 7% of total calorie intake (Figure 2)
(Levine et al., 2014).
IF and PF in the Prevention and Treatment of Chronic
Diseases in Humans
IF and Diseases
IF can have a wide range of effects on metabolic markers and risk
factors or diseases, including body fat and blood pressure. In
overweight subjects who consumed an �500 kcal but relatively
high-protein diet for 2 days a week for 6 months, abdominal fat
was reduced, blood pressure was reduced, and insulin sensitivity
was increased (Harvie et al., 2011). Similar results were obtained

were
completely reversed after 7 days of refeeding and,

FMD lowered visceral fat without affecting lean
body mass, delayed and reduced cancer inci-
dence and inflammatory diseases, rejuvenated the
immune system, and either delayed or partially
reversed bone mineral density loss. Chronic FMD
cycles also caused a major increase in embryonic-
like stem/progenitor cells and induced hippocam-
pal neurogenesis, and caused improvements in a
wide range of cognitive tasks. Therefore, periodic
FMD started even at a relatively old age may be
utilized as a regenerative approach by causing
cycles of a highly coordinated process in which
various cell populations undergo a rapid depletion
followed by regeneration, which is likely to involve
stem and progenitor cells, including MSPCs. We
hypothesize that these multi-systemic effects of

after 2–3 weeks of every other day fasting
(Halberg et al., 2005; Heilbronn et al.,
2005). A review of findings for all relevant
clinical trials assessing both chronic calo-
rie restriction in the 20%–50% range (CR)
and IF concludes that CR is superior in
causing loss of body weight compared to
IF, but both interventions have similar ef-
fects on the reduction of visceral fat, insu-
lin, and insulin resistance (Barnosky et al.,
2014). However, it was also concluded
that neither CR nor IF had clinically signif-
icant effects on glucose levels, raising the
possibility that both of these interventions may have limited appli-
cations in the prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome
and diabetes, particularly considering the difficulties in achieving
compliance to either severe and chronic CR or severe restrictions
limiting calorie consumption to 500–600 kcal per day between 9
and 15 times per month, on average.
IF fasting may also have some effects on inflammatory dis-
eases, since 2 months of alternate day fasting resulted in a sig-
nificant reduction in inflammatory markers in patients suffering
from asthma (Johnson et al., 2007).
PF and Diseases
One of the well-established clinical uses of PF is in the treatment
of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Four different controlled studies
have indicated that fasting periods lasting from 1 to 3 weeks
reduce the symptoms of RA, although these effects are reversed
by a return to the normal diet unless the PF is followed by a vege-
tarian diet (Mu
¨ ller et al., 2001).
PF may also be beneficial in the treatment of hypertension. In a
study, 13 days of water-only fasting reduced systolic blood

 pressure below 120 in 82% of subjects with mild hypertension
(Goldhamer et al., 2002). Blood pressure remained significantly
lower after subjects had returned to their normal diet for
6 days. In another study, 10–11 days of fasting decreased sys-
tolic blood pressure of hypertensive patients by 37–60 mm, but
this study did not follow patients after they returned to their
normal diet (Goldhamer et al., 2001). In summary, both IF and
PF have potential applications for inflammatory and cardiovas-
cular diseases, but additional, larger, and randomized studies
are needed before these strategies can be integrated into the
standard of care by physicians.
Optimal Methodology and Public Health
The Periodic FMDs
Several major obstacles may be responsible for the very limited
contribution of PF to standard medical practice: (1) the lack or
pre-clinical and clinical data supporting specific and consistent
effects of fasting on the prevention and treatment of diseases,
and the mechanisms involved; (2) the safety concerns related
to the adoption of water-only consumption or the frequently
adopted very low calorie diets (�200 kcal) outside of a clinic;
and (3) the difficulties associated with compliance to these
extreme diets. Although hundreds of thousands of people are
likely to undergo some form of PF every year, healthcare profes-
sionals strongly recommend that water-only or similar fasting in-
terventions be limited to specialized clinics staffed with medical
personnel.
FMDs were developed first for mice and eventually for humans
to address these concerns and help identify both the positive
and potentially negative effects of fasting while minimizing safety
and compliance concerns. The FMD, which was originally devel-
oped to replace water-only fasting in mice, has now been tested
in humans. The human FMD consists of a 5-day regimen
providing between 725 and 1,090 kcal, with a macronutrient con-
tent selected to mimic water-only fasting but a micronutrient
content aimed at maximizing nourishment. Nineteen subjects
were randomized to undergo three cycles of a monthly FMD,
whereas an additional 19 subjects were randomized to a control
diet. After three FMD cycles, the average reported side effect
caused by the diet was very low and below ‘‘mild’’ (<1 on a scale
of 1–5) (Brandhorst et al., 2015). After they resumed their normal
diet, subjects who completed three FMD cycles displayed a
5.9% drop in fasting glucose, as well as a 15% reduction in
the level of IGF-1, a factor associated with elevated cancer inci-
dence (Chan et al., 2000; Giovannucci et al., 2000; Levine et al.,
2014). Body weight was reduced by approximately 3%, but
abdominal fat loss appeared to represent a major portion of
this loss, as would be expected from the major and transient
elevation in ketone bodies during the FMD, indicating a switch
to a fatty acid catabolism mode. Remarkably, the relative lean
body mass adjusted for body weight was increased after three
FMD cycles (Brandhorst et al., 2013, 2015).
In agreement with the anti-inflammatory effect of the FMD in
mice, C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation and
risk factor for cardiovascular disease, returned to the normal
level in seven of the eight subjects with elevated baseline serum
levels, whereas no changes were observed for subjects with
normal baseline CRP levels. Also in agreement with the elevation
of mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells (MSPCs) in response
to the FMD in mice, MSPC levels were transiently elevated dur-
ing the FMD in human subjects (Brandhorst et al., 2015).
Taken together, these results indicate that PF, applied in the
form of a moderate calorie FMD, can promote a rejuvenating ef-
fect on different systems, leading to an improvement in markers/
risk factors for disease, particularly in subjects with elevated
baseline levels for these markers. Although it is too early to deter-
mine whether the multi-system generative effects caused by the
FMD in mice can also occur in humans, the ability of the FMD to
be more effective in at-risk subjects, together with the elevation
of MSPC, indicates that PF may also promote regenerative
effects in humans. Larger clinical trials, and ideally an FDA
approval, will be essential in moving the FMD and other PF-
type interventions from the few specialized clinics and a very
limited number of patients to a much wider use in medicine.
IF
Whereas water-only but also 500–600 kcal alternate day fasting
is very unlikely to be feasible for the great majority of the popu-
lation of most countries, the 5:2 diet described earlier—requiring
only 2 days of a 500–600 kcal intake—has a much higher poten-
tial to be considered for medical interventions. However, addi-
tional rodent studies showing a clearer effect on longevity and
healthspan are needed. Also, additional studies taking advan-
tage of the new molecular understanding of the connection
between specific nutrients and the activation of pro-aging and
anti-regenerative genes exploited in the development of FMDs
are likely to enhance the efficacy of IF diets. In addition, larger
clinical trials are necessary, including the investigation of safety
concerns such as those related to the effects of the frequent but
irregular changes in calorie consumption and eating pattern on
sleep and metabolic disorders.
TRF in Health and Longevity
TRF is a daily eating pattern in which all nutrient intake occurs
within a few hours (usually %12 hr) every day, with no overt
attempt to alter nutrient quality or quantity. The concept of
TRF arose within the context of circadian rhythms. Circadian
rhythms are daily �24 hr rhythms in metabolism, physiology,
and behavior that are sustained under constant light or dark con-
ditions. These rhythms are observed in diverse organisms from
cyanobacteria to humans, but are absent in several bacteria
and yeast. Although several features of 24 hr rhythms in cellular
metabolism, redox, DNA replication, DNA repair, and cellular
growth are conserved across species, the core circadian oscil-
lator components are not conserved across phylogenetic king-
doms. We will discuss the molecular mechanism of circadian
rhythms in mammals and use a few examples from other species
to highlight the adaptive advantages of having a robust circadian
clock.
At the molecular level, circadian rhythms in mammals are
generated and sustained by cell-autonomous, interlocked tran-
scription-translation feedback loops. In this molecular circuit,
the transcriptional activators BMAL1 (MOP3 or ARNTL) and
CLOCK or NPAS2 bind to the cis-acting E-box elements in
Period 1 (Per1), Per2, Cryptochrome 1 (Cry1), and Cry2 genes,
thereby driving their transcription. As PER and CRY protein
levels rise, they repress CLOCK/NPAS2/BMAL1 transcriptional
activity, inhibiting their own expression. PER and CRY are sub-
sequently degraded, thus closing the loop (reviewed in Hardin
and Panda, 2013). In an interlocked loop, CLOCK and BMAL1

absence of food, very few transcripts show oscillation, while under ad libitum access to standard diet, mice eat a larger portion of their daily food intake during the
night and show somewhat increased number of rhythmic transcripts. Restricting food access to night time not only does not reduce food intake, but also in-
creases the number of rhythmic transcripts, improves amplitude, and synchronizes the phases of oscillations of rhythmic transcripts. Daytime feeding of the same
diet reverses the phases of oscillation of nearly all hepatic transcripts, thus illustrating the dominant role of eating time on the peripheral circadian oscillations. The

 proteins also drive transcription of the retinoid-related orphan re-
ceptor (ROR) and the REV-ERB family of transcription factors
(Cho et al., 2012; Preitner et al., 2002; Sato et al., 2004; Ueda
et al., 2002). ROR proteins activate transcription of the Bmal1
gene by binding to the ROR element (RORE), whereas REV-
ERB proteins competitively bind to the same site and negate
the function of ROR proteins, thus producing rhythmic levels of
Bmal1 gene products (Sato et al., 2004).
Although the mammalian circadian oscillator is cell autono-
mous, there is a hierarchical architecture to the organization of
these oscillators. A central oscillator in the hypothalamic supra-
chiasmatic nucleus (SCN) generates daily rhythms in activity-
rest and associated rhythms in core body temperature and
feeding-fasting, and rhythms in several hormones, such as mela-
tonin, growth hormone, and cortisol. The SCN oscillator is en-
trained to the ambient light in order to be synchronized with
the 24 hr light/dark cycle. This ensures adaptation of the organ-
ism to changing day length under natural conditions. Peripheral
oscillators in individual organs indirectly receive daily timing cues
through systemic signals such as body temperature and hor-
mones (glucagon, cortisol). The daily acts of feeding and fasting
also affect these systemic signals, as well as cell-autonomous
energy-sensing pathways that interact with the cellular clocks.
Therefore, the light/dark cycle and the feeding/fasting cycle
both profoundly affect the circadian system.
In different organs, the cell-autonomous oscillator modulates
daily rhythms in transcription and protein translation of a large
number of genes, which in turn generate daily rhythms in cellular
metabolism, repair, cell division, and growth in a tissue-specific
manner (Mohawk et al., 2012). Such temporal coordination from
individual cells to the whole organism optimizes fitness. The role
of circadian oscillator in fitness and lifespan is conserved across
species and has been demonstrated in both laboratory and nat-
ural conditions.
The circadian clock intimately interacts with nutrient-sensing
pathways. Frequent eating and the absence of a defined fasting
period likely sustain modestly elevated levels of fed-state phys-
iology and disturb the normal counter-regulatory metabolic state
that occurs during fasting. During feeding, activation of the insu-
lin-pAKT-mTOR pathway drives downstream gene activities that
promote anabolic processes. In contrast, a few hours of fasting
activate AMPK, which triggers repair and catabolic processes. In
parallel, AMPK-mediated inhibition of mTOR activity (Inoki et al.,
2012) and downstream anabolic pathways ensures separation of
catabolic and anabolic processes. In addition to well-character-
ized anabolic targets, the mTOR pathway also phosphorylates
casein kinase 1 (CK1) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3),
both of which phosphorylate the circadian clock component
PER, altering its stability (Zheng and Sehgal, 2010). This is one
mechanism by which feeding affects the clock. However, fasting
signals also affect the circadian clock, as AMPK phosphorylates
CRY and promotes its degradation (Lamia et al., 2009). Addition-
ally, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and sirtuins,
whose levels or activity fluctuate with the cellular energy state,
also affect the circadian clock (Asher et al., 2008; Masri and
Sassone-Corsi, 2013; Nakahata et al., 2008, 2009; Ramsey
et al., 2009). Therefore, feeding/fasting rhythms enhance the
robustness or amplitude of the oscillation of circadian activator
and repressor components (Figure 3). Components of the circa-
dian clock bind to transcriptional regulatory regions of thou-
sands of genes and drive their rhythmic transcription in a largely
tissue-specific manner (Koike et al., 2012; Vollmers et al., 2012).
The mTOR and AMPK pathways also modulate activities of
downstream proteins, including the transcription regulators
CREB, PPAR, FOXO, Hsf1, HNF, and PGC1 (Inoki et al., 2012).
However, the regulatory regions of most genes are targeted by
multiple transcription factors (Hager et al., 2009). Accordingly,
many transcripts regulated in a circadian fashion that are down-
stream targets of clock components are also targeted by tran-
scriptional regulators whose activities are modulated by feeding
and fasting (Bugge et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2011; Koike et al.,
2012; Vollmers et al., 2009). Such convergent regulation by
circadian clock and feeding/fasting sensors offers adaptive
advantages to the organism.
In the absence of food intake, the self-sustaining circadian
oscillator drives rudimentary oscillation of a handful of tran-
scripts in the liver (Figure 3), thereby offering an anticipatory drive
for feeding or fasting. Daily feeding/fasting rhythms drive
signaling pathways that interact with the circadian oscillator
to increase the robustness or peak-to-trough differences of
these transcriptional oscillations. These transcripts then mediate
anabolic and catabolic processes that are appropriate for spe-
cific phases of the feeding/fasting cycle. In the absence of a
functional circadian clock, feeding- and fasting-driven pathways
can drive some oscillations in transcription (Vollmers et al.,
2009), downstream metabolites (Adamovich et al., 2014), and
even the gut microbiota (Thaiss et al., 2014), but these signals
cannot fully compensate for the loss of the circadian clock.
Therefore, synergistic interactions between the circadian oscil-
lator and feeding/fasting signals ensure that anabolic and cata-
bolic types of metabolism are coordinately regulated in harmony
with the animal’s activity/rest cycle.
Epidemiology of Circadian Disruption
Susceptibility of the SCN circadian clock to light and the periph-
eral clocks to the time of food intake helps synchronize the inter-
nal timing system with ambient conditions. Such plasticity of the
circadian system has evolved to adapt to seasonal changes in
day length and associated changes in the time of food availabil-
ity. However, circadian plasticity has become a liability in mod-
ern days, as our human daily patterns are no longer constrained
by the day/night cycle. The use of artificial light during the night
has enabled shiftwork for industrial production, public safety,
health care, transportation, entertainment, information technol-
ogy, food preparation, and the hospitality industry. These indus-
tries and services, in turn, enable the larger public to be awake,
active, and hungry at any time of the day. Such an erratic lifestyle
can cause chronic disruption to the circadian system. Nutrition
absence of a circadian clock, as in Cry1�/�;Cry2�/� mutant mice, disrupts eating pattern, and their liver shows no significant rhythm in gene expression.
Subjecting mutant mice to TRF restores oscillation of some, but not all, genes that normally oscillate in the wild-type mice.

 quality also plays a role in maintaining robustness of the circa-
dian system. In rodents, ad libitum access to a high-fat diet
(HFD) has been used extensively to induce obesity and the asso-
ciated metabolic diseases. However, the HFD eating paradigm
also blunts the daily cycle of nocturnal eating and daytime fasting
in these animals (Kohsaka et al., 2007). Frequent eating in this
model causes chronic disruption of the circadian clock and
dampens molecular circadian rhythms (Hatori et al., 2012).
Finally, age is also a risk for dampening the endogenous circa-
dian clock. Fibroblasts from older individuals have a dampened
circadian clock, and some of this dampening is mediated by
serum factors (Pagani et al., 2011). With increased human
longevity, age-related dampening of the circadian clock is
becoming a risk for chronic circadian disruption.
Lifestyles that chronically disrupt circadian rhythms are
endemic to modern society and may include bona fide shift
workers, individuals with a lifestyle that resembles a shift work,
and individuals with underlying sleep disruption. With the
emerging evidence that eating patterns also determine the
robustness of circadian rhythms, it is conceivable that individ-
uals with night-eating syndrome or binge-eating habits may
also have underlying circadian disruption. Shift workers who
work in the morning (starting at or before 6 a.m.), evening (ending
after 6 p.m.), or overnight comprise 15%–20% of the work force
population in the United States (McMenamin, 2007). Given the
defined nature of their work and disruptive circadian lifestyle,
they have been extensively studied to determine the health
impact of shift work. There are strong correlations between shift
work and predispositions to cancer, obesity, and metabolic syn-
drome (Arble et al., 2015; Knutson et al., 2007; Spiegel et al.,
2005). In addition to the disruption of cell-autonomous circadian
rhythms, shift work may also cause the desynchronization of tis-
sue-specific clocks via disruption of the hypothalamus-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA) signaling axis (Nicolaides et al., 2014; Sookoian
et al., 2007). Interestingly, other factors that affect the normal
cyclical oscillation of this axis (e.g., chronic stress or treatment
with high doses of corticosteroids) lead to metabolic syndrome.
Some of this effect may be related to circadian dyssynchrony.
Causal effect of shift work on metabolic diseases is increas-
ingly tested in both animals and humans under controlled labo-

Clinical Applications
Evidence for the physiological importance of a robust circadian
eating pattern comes from rodents. Mice fed an HFD exhibit a
severely dampened circadian eating rhythm and develop meta-
bolic diseases (Kohsaka et al., 2007). Restricting access to high-
fat food to only 8–12 hr per day does not reduce overall caloric
intake (compared to animals fed ad libitum), but improves circa-
dian rhythms and helps prevent or reverse metabolic diseases
(Chaix et al., 2014; Hatori et al., 2012; Zarrinpar et al., 2014)
(Figure 4). The benefits associated with TRF or a robust
feeding/fasting cycle against metabolic disease involves multi-
ple temporal changes in physiology and metabolism in different
organs. In the liver, TRF reprograms metabolic flux through
gluconeogenesis by redirecting pyruvate metabolism to the
TCA cycle and glucose-6P metabolism through the pentose
phosphate
pathway.
These
two
pathways
contribute
to
increased production of nucleotides. TRF also improves the
expression of Cyp7A, which redirects cholesterol to bile acid
production. TRF also increases activity levels of brown adipose
tissue (thereby increasing metabolic rate), increases fatty acid
b-oxidation, and reduces hepatic glucose production (Froy,
2011; Froy et al., 2006; Froy and Miskin, 2010). In white adipose
tissue, TRF reduces macrophage infiltration and resulting
inflammation. In Drosophila, TRF has significant beneficial effect
on cardiac health and also improves sleep (Gill et al., 2015)
(Figure 4).
These observations in animals beg the question of whether the
temporal pattern of energy intake (i.e., the duration of feeding) is
a determinant of metabolic health in humans. The daily eating
pattern in humans has not been well characterized in an evi-
dence-based manner. The traditional 24 hr recall or food fre-
quency questionnaires are relatively weak in extracting meal
timing and variability in meal timing from day to day. In a simpli-
fied

approach,
a

method to longitudinally monitor what, when, and how much in-

eating patterns (Gill and Panda, 2015). Participants logged food

 variations. Average estimated caloric intake was 122% of their
calculated maintenance calories, thus validating the method
does not underestimate caloric intake. Surprisingly, among a
cohort of 156 adults (age 21–56 years, both males and females,
BMI 19–36, no shift workers), nearly 50% were likely to eat during
a prolonged period every day (>15 hr) and only 20% ate three
meals/day. Nearly 25% of adults changed their breakfast time
by >2 hr during the weekend. Overall, 80% of adults consumed
a non-water food or beverage within an hour of waking up and
50% of adults consumed food or beverage %2 hr before bed
time. This implies that a sizeable portion of daily food intake is
in the form of frequent snacks between major meals and after-
dinner snacks or beverages. Extension of daily eating duration
(from first caloric intake to last caloric intake) may also account
for excessive caloric intake.
The feasibility of humans adopting a TRF protocol has shown
some promise. The same study (Gill and Panda, 2015) tested
whether altering the daily eating duration by allowing partici-
pants to eat their daily caloric intake within a self-selected
10–11 hr period would impart health benefits to overweight indi-
viduals. Eight overweight participants ate their entire daily caloric
intake within a self-selected 10–11 hr window. For half of them,
the eating window ended past 8 p.m. so that they could have din-
ner with family. However, unlike rodents, who consume the same
number of calories when TRF of 8–15 hr is imposed, reducing
eating duration in humans also reduced their daily caloric intake
by up to 20% (some of this reduction came from reduction in
late-night alcohol and snacks). They lost up to 4% body weight
in 16 weeks and retained this weight loss for up to 1 year. They
also reported improved sleep at night and elevated alertness
during the day.
Additional studies have also suggested that TRF confers
potential benefits to human health. In a retrospective study
examining the self-reported duration of overnight fasting and
breast cancer incidence, a prolonged overnight fasting period
of R13 hr correlated with reduced breast cancer risk (Marinac
et al., 2015a, 2015b). While these reports show feasibility of
TRF as an intervention or voluntary adoption of TRF as a lifestyle,
more focused studies on the impact of TRF on both prevention
and prognosis of chronic diseases are warranted. Nearly 50%
of United States adults have an existing chronic disease condi-
tion for which they may be taking a medication or supplement.
Transcriptome and proteome studies have identified circadian
rhythms in the abundance of several proteins that are targets
of FDA-approved drugs or of proteins involved in the absorption
and clearance of drugs (Neufeld-Cohen et al., 2016; Robles
et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014). Since eating pattern determines
the phases of circadian rhythms in peripheral organs, timing of
medication relative to the timing of food intake will likely impact
prognosis.
Age-Specific Nutrition
PF as well as TRF and IF can have profound beneficial effects on
the health of rodents and humans. However, most of the studies
testing these interventions have been performed in young organ-
isms or have not compared their effects in young and old. Under-
standing the age-specific effects of these interventions is partic-
ularly important considering the major changes in weight, growth
hormones, and steroid hormones that occur at different ages
and the studies indicating that certain restriction can be benefi-
cial or have no negative effects in young, but not old, organisms.
For example, severe protein restriction causes weight loss in old,
but not young, mice, and low protein intake is associated with
protection from mortality in 65 and younger, but not 66 and older,
individuals (Levine et al., 2014). Similarly, FMD cycles were
highly protective in middle age and old mice, but 4 (but not 3)
days of the FMD appeared to be detrimental in very old mice
(Brandhorst et al., 2015). These studies indicate that dietary in-
terventions in rodents and humans must be modified to optimize
efficacy in at least two, but possibly more, adult age ranges, with
results indicating that the 65–70 age range represents a key tran-
sition point. This is clearly an area of longevity research in need of
a major expansion of both basic and clinical investigation.
Conclusions
Obesity in the United States, which has nearly tripled in the last
50 years, has been accompanied by an approximately 7-fold in-
crease in diabetes prevalence but a much more modest increase
in cancer incidence (DeSantis et al., 2014). Although everyday
dietary choices can clearly accelerate aging, increase the inci-
dence of age-related diseases, and anticipate their onset, we
are far from a consensus on what constitutes a diet that opti-
mizes healthspan. Even if a consensus could be reached, its
implementation could take decades. Pharmacological interven-
tions can have potent effects on risk factors for diseases, but
they are often accompanied by considerable adverse side
effects, and the lowering of a specific risk factor often does
not lower mortality. Recently, IF and PF, as well as TRF, have
emerged as potential strategies for avoiding major dietary
changes while achieving strong effects not just for one disease
risk factor, but for an array of factors that constitutes the founda-
tion for metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, cancer,
and possibly neurodegenerative diseases (Mattson et al.,
2014). Although their mechanisms of action are still poorly under-
stood, they appear to promote coordinated effects on the aging
process and do not simply inhibit specific enzymes, as is often
the case for drugs. To allow these interventions to be imple-
mented by a large portion of the population, it will be necessary
to test and standardize them by methodologies similar to those
carried out for the approval of drugs by the FDA. Thus, extensive
and conclusive experiments should be performed in model or-
ganisms to understand molecular mechanisms of actions and
demonstrate efficacy, which will serve as the foundation for ran-
domized clinical trials. Because rodent models have had limited
success in helping identify effective therapies, particularly for
cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s, it is important to take
advantage of organisms in which diseases of interest develop
spontaneously and have strong similarities to the human coun-
terpart. For example, dogs and monkeys may represent valuable
model organisms for testing PF and TRF and their effect on dis-
eases, particularly since these interventions will not require
chronic dietary restrictions and can be adjusted to only cause
a minor weight loss. Undoubtedly, FDA approval would be
important for these dietary interventions to become standard
of care, or at least viable and safe options to pharmacological
therapies. In addition, these dietary interventions have the po-
tential to have additive and possibly synergistic effects when
combined with drugs, as is clearly emerging in both rodent and

 human studies in which FMDs are combined with standard can-
cer therapies. Because they require a more in-depth under-
standing of what they do, how they can be combined, and the
type of condition or disease they can prevent or treat, it will be
necessary to involve and train medical doctors, registered dieti-
tians, and other healthcare professionals on how to safely and
effectively implement their use.
