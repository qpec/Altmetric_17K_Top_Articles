Organic core-sheath nanowire artificial synapses
with femtojoule energy consumption
Wentao Xu,1 Sung-Yong Min,1 Hyunsang Hwang,1 Tae-Woo Lee1,2*
Emulation of biological synapses is an important step toward construction of large-scale brain-inspired elec-
tronics. Despite remarkable progress in emulating synaptic functions, current synaptic devices still consume
energy that is orders of magnitude greater than do biological synapses (~10 fJ per synaptic event). Reduction
of energy consumption of artificial synapses remains a difficult challenge. We report organic nanowire (ONW)
synaptic transistors (STs) that emulate the important working principles of a biological synapse. The ONWs
emulate the morphology of nerve fibers. With a core-sheath–structured ONW active channel and a well-confined
300-nm channel length obtained using ONW lithography, ~1.23 fJ per synaptic event for individual ONW was at-
tained, which rivals that of biological synapses. The ONW STs provide a significant step toward realizing low-
energy–consuming artificial intelligent electronics and open new approaches to assembling soft neuromorphic
systems with nanometer feature size.
INTRODUCTION
Synapses are among the most important functional units for learning
and memory (1, 2). They consume an extremely small amount of
energy (10 fJ per synaptic event), so a human brain consumes only
as much energy as a domestic lightbulb but can outperform a super-
computer in many aspects. Recently, great efforts have been made to
develop synapse-emulating circuits (3) and electronic devices (4–6),
but they still consume orders of magnitude more energy (generally
above picojoule level) than do natural synapses (7–11). Solving these
problems requires appropriate choice of materials and design of de-
vices; these remain difficult challenges.
Here, we focus on design and fabrication of an artificial synapse.
Attaining this goal presents several challenges: the first is to select a
material that mimics the morphology of nerve fibers that form synap-
tic junction. We selected organic nanowires (ONWs) because they
mimic nerve fiber morphology in terms of elongated shape, flexibility,
and good scalability to large areas, which enable formation of a three-
dimensional grid of crisscrossing alignment of nerve fibers in a human
brain (12). This is the first morphological emulation of nerve fibers for
use in an artificial synapse, which has great potential in various soft
bio-inspired and bio-integrated electronics (13–18). The second chal-
lenge is to design a material structure that can emulate, in a single
device, the important working principles of a synapse. Considering
the distinct reversibility of trapping and detrapping ions in different
polymer matrices, ONWs with the structure of a polyethylene oxide
(PEO) sheath wrapped around a poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl)
(P3HT) core were fabricated to facilitate the development of short-
term and long-term plasticity. Furthermore, we aimed to achieve an
artificial synapse that has energy consumption comparable to that of
a biological synapse. This low energy consumption is essential to con-
structing highly integrated, very large-scale neuromorphic computing
systems. With a nanowire lithographic 300-nm channel length, ~1.23 fJ
per synaptic event was attained, which is the lowest attained so far and
even rivals that of biological synapses.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
We designed ONW synaptic transistor (ST) architecture to emulate the
functions of a biological synapse (Fig. 1). A typical ONW ST was com-
posed of a conducting line probe (A′), an ion gel, an ONW (B′), and two
metal contact pads on a substrate (fig. S1). The conducting line probe
(A′), which mimicked a biological axon and a presynaptic membrane,
was in contact with the ion gel to supply signals analogous to presynaptic
spikes(fig.S2).Theiongelprovidedmobileions that migrate in response
to the presynaptic spikes. The ion gel between the probe and ONW
emulates the synaptic cleft, which is ionically conductive to allow chem-
ical transmission across it but is electrically insulating to separate elec-
trical input and output and thereby to ensure that synaptic processes
can occur independently at the presynaptic membrane and postsynaptic
membrane. The core-sheath ONW (B′) has a P3HT inner core in a PEO
sheath (fig. S3). The ONW combined with a drain electrode mimics a
biological dendrite (B). The core-sheath structure of ONW underlies
the mechanism of short-term and long-term plasticity in the artificial
synapse. The presynaptic spikes provide an electrical field that helps
ions penetrate the PEO sheath or even the P3HT core. The process in
which ions penetrate the PEO sheath under presynaptic spikes and
later rapidly diffuse back to the ion gel induces short-term plasticity.
A number of consecutive presynaptic spikes increase the depth to
which ions penetrate into the P3HT core, in which ions have low sol-
ubility and cannot easily diffuse back to the ion gel spontaneously;
this restricted mobility induces long-term potentiation (LTP) (fig. S4).
Here, gold electrodes were used for electrical connections, and a SiO2-
coated Si substrate was used to provide physical support for the device.
Our homebuilt electrohydrodynamic NW (e-NW) printer rapidly and
inexpensively fabricated ONWs on a large scale while simultaneously
controlling the location and alignment of individual ONWs (19). The
spacing of ONWs was computer-controlled (fig. S5). The diameter of
ONWs could be controlled by adjusting the solution concentration

mer semiconductor materials (fig. S7).
A biological synapse permits a neuron to pass an electrical or chem-
ical signal to another cell (20). Synapses are widely believed to contri-
bute to the formation of memory, and the synaptic strength is thought
to result in the storage of information by changing the amplitude of a
postsynaptic current. A brief application (presynaptic spike) of voltage
(−1 V, 50 ms) on the ion gel triggered an excitatory postsynaptic cur-
rent (EPSC), which reached a peak value of 3.82 nA, and then gradually
decayed to a resting current of ~1 nA (Fig. 2, A to C). This trend emulates
a biological process, in which a neuron generates an action potential
(spike) that propagates along the axon and is transmitted across a syn-
apse to the next neuron. This behavior in the device originates from ion
migration in the ion gel (fig. S4, A to C). Before the spike, anions and
cations are distributed randomly. A negative presynaptic spike causes
anions to accumulate at the ion gel–ONW interface during the spike;
the high density of anions surrounding the NW attracts a certain num-
ber of holes in the P3HT channel, which move in response to a driving
voltage to form an EPSC. After the spike, the distribution of anions re-
turns to random, and the EPSC gradually decays. Analogously, inhibi-
tory postsynaptic current (IPSC) was triggered by a positive presynaptic
spike (Fig. 2D). EPSC and IPSC are complementary processes that
underlie the basic features of neuronal transmission.
The change in the strength of a synapse’s response over time in re-
sponse to external stimuli is referred to as synaptic plasticity and is re-
garded as an important foundation of learning and memory. Short-term
plasticity can either strengthen or weaken a synapse for a short time on
scales from tens of milliseconds to a few minutes. Short-term synaptic
enhancement can be attained when two spikes arrive in rapid succession
(Fig. 2E) (21). It is involved in encoding temporal information in audi-
tory and visual signals (22) and has an important function in associative
learning, information processing, pattern recognition, and sound source
localization (2, 23–25). Although many biological mechanisms remain
unclear, for example, how exactly short-term plasticity is involved in
pattern recognition and associative learning, scientists continue to apply
existing knowledge to achieve some of these functions in artificial
systems (4, 25, 26). Short-term synaptic enhancement was successfully
mimicked in our ONW ST by applying two consecutive negative pre-
synaptic spikes with an interspike interval (780 ≤ Dtpre ≤ 7800 ms). The
amplitude of the second EPSC peak (A2) was 1.62 times the amplitude
triggered by the first spike (A1) (Fig. 2E). The increase in A2 was caused
by residual ions that had accumulated during the first spike. Some of
these ions accumulated near the ONW–ion gel interface and added to
the total amount of ions accumulated during the second-spike period.
The quantity of residual ions increased as Dtpre decreased, thereby
increasing the summation of EPSCs. The A2/A1 ratio decreased as Dtpre
increased (fig. S8). This spontaneous decay of current retention can be
regarded as analogous to loss of memory by a human brain because the
EPSC trends fit very well with a forgetting curve (y = b × t−m) (fig. S9).
Comparably, further decreased IPSC was also obtained by applying ad-
ditional positive pulses (fig. S10).
Excitatory and inhibitory synapses exhibit enhancement and depres-
sion, the combined use of which underlies short-term memory. Spatio-
temporally correlated stimuli from different presynapses could be used
to trigger a postsynaptic current to establish dynamic logic in a neural
network. The basic spatiotemporal dynamic logic was demonstrated in
Fig. 1. Schematic of biological neuronal network and an ONW ST that emulates a biological synapse. The conductive lines and probe (A′)
mimic an axon (A) that delivers presynaptic spikes from a preneuron to the presynaptic membrane. The mobile ions in the ion gel move in the
electrical field analogous to the neuron transmitters in the synaptic cleft that later induces an excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) in the dendrite
through the contact of postsynaptic membrane. An ONW (B′) combined with a drain electrode mimics a biological dendrite (B). EPSC is generated in
the ONW in response to presynaptic spikes and is delivered to a postneuron through connections to the drain electrode.

 a simple structure that uses an ONW ST withtwo laterally coupled gates
(Fig. 2, Fand G). EPSCresponseswere recorded undera constant source-
drain voltage of 0.75 V. A single spike on presynapse 1 (−1 V, 50 ms)
triggered EPSC 1 with an amplitude of ~4 nA; a single spike on pre-
synapse 2 (−2 V, 50 ms) triggered EPSC 2 with an amplitude of ~6 nA
(Fig. 2H). When presynaptic spike 1 and presynaptic spike 2 were ap-
plied sequentially with an interspike interval (Dtpre2 − pre1), the accu-
mulation of migrated ions caused the EPSC 2 induced by the second
spike to be superimposed onto the EPSC 1 induced by the first spike; as
a result, the total amplitude of EPSC increased. When Dtpre2 − pre1 = 0, the
EPSC1 and EPSC 2 were triggered simultaneously and resulted in a max-
imum EPSC of ~22 nA in the postsynapse. The EPSC amplitude at the
end of the presynaptic spike 1 (set as t = 0, where EPSC summation was
recorded) was plotted as a function of Dtpre2 − pre1 to understand the influ-
ence of a spike on a correlated presynapse (Fig. 2I). The amplitude of
EPSC at t = 0 is consistent with the peak amplitude of the EPSC 1 if the
EPSC 2 were triggered afterward (Dtpre2 − pre1 > 0). However, when
EPSC 2 was triggered before EPSC 1 (Dtpre2 − pre1 < 0), EPSC at t = 0
became the superimposition of EPSC 1 and the remaining EPSC 2. This
is similar to the neural response to spatiotemporally correlated stimuli
from different presynapses.
Long-term plasticity that usually occurs at excitatory synapses in-
cludes LTP and long-term depression (LTD) (27), which are respective-
ly a persistent increase and a persistent decrease in synaptic strength,
following a number of consecutive stimulations of a synapse. Because
memories are thought to be encoded by modification of synaptic strength
(28), LTP is widely regarded as a mechanism that underlies learning
and memory in the brain (22). LTP in the ONW ST was demonstrated
by applying an increased number of presynaptic spikes (Fig. 3A); af-
ter this treatment, the EPSC increased by as much as ~15 times and was
~1.5timesthe resting current 5 min after the spikes. LTP tends to greatly
increase electrical responses of neurons to stimuli, and this increase
(“potentiation”) in synaptic strength lasts much longer than do other
processes that affect synaptic strength. In contrast, LTD selectively

 weakens specific synapses, may prevent synaptic strength from reach-
ing some level of maximum efficacy that results from simply continued
LTP, and inhibits encoding of new information (29). LTD was obtained
by applying consecutive positive synaptic spikes (Fig. 3B). The mimick-
ing of short-term and long-term plasticity in a single ONW ST has
potential in constructing spiking neural network, which adapts to real-
time functions, for example, real-time pattern recognition (4, 25).
Application of approximately 60 cycles of negative spikes increased
the EPSC amplitude by 22 times; to reduce the ONW conductance back
to the initial value, 60 positive pulses were required (Fig. 3C). The
results suggest that the present configuration of the ONW device can
simulate the analog storage capacity of synapses. When a series of neg-
ative (or positive) spikes were applied, the negative ions continuously
accumulated toward (or away from) the conductive channel, resulting
in significant potentiation (or depression). The change rate in the syn-
aptic strength increased with the number of spikes. However, when 60
negative (or positive) presynaptic spikes were applied, the postsynaptic
current tended to saturate without further significant change due to a
newly established equilibrium of ion movement. The negative pre-
synaptic spikes drove the mobile ions to near the channel region, but
the residual accumulated ions tended to drift back during the interval
between the presynaptic spikes. These two trends coexisted because of
the fixed number of mobile ions in the ion gel matrix. We hypothesize
that the rates of the two opposite trends of ion movement became equal
when sufficient ions were urged to approach the channel region by a
certain number of presynaptic spikes and that at this point, equilibrium
was finally established so that no further significant increase in EPSC
was observed. Among simulations of various synaptic behaviors,
symmetry characteristics of potentiation and depression were found
to be the most important requirement. To improve the symmetry in
the curve, we applied nonidentical presynaptic spikes and observed sig-
nificant improvement in symmetry (Fig. 3D). Spike timing–dependent
plasticity (STDP), which describes the change of synaptic weight de-
pending on relative timing of the spikes of pre- and postneurons, is
an important synaptic adaption rule of Hebbian learning. A typical
asymmetric form of STDP (fig. S11, A and B) was obtained using an
ONW ST, which could be useful in the construction of a network
(30–32).
Ultralow energy consumption is one of the most important superio-
rities of a neural system; to achieve this, different types of electronic de-
vices have been investigated. Although some of those have shown
picojoule-level energy consumptions, further reducing synaptic energy

 to the femtojoule level remains a challenging task, but is an important
requirement for the construction of very large systems. To achieve signif-
icantly reduced energy consumption, we used polyvinyl carbazole (PVK)
ONWs as lithographic tools to produce a narrow gap of ~300 nm be-
tween electrodes to provide a short channel length (fig. S12, A to C).
Synaptic enhancement and depression of a nanogap ONW ST were also
demonstrated from consecutive small presynaptic spikes (−1 mV) (Fig.
4A). Energy consumption was estimated as E = AIW, where A = 20 mV
is the drain voltage, I = 5.52 pA is the current flowing across the device,
and W = 111.2 ms is the width of the programming pulse. The
minimum E for the 10-ONW artificial synapses with nanogap (fig.
S12D) was ~12.3 fJ per spike, so the average energy consumption was
~1.23 fJ per spike for each NW. This value is orders of magnitude lower
than those of currently available synapse-inspired electronic devices
(Fig. 4B) and rivals that of biological synapses. This result shows that
these ONW STs have the potential to mimic the low energy consump-
tion of a biological synapse in a human brain, in which each spike has an
average frequency of ~10 Hz with an amplitude of ~100 mV, and each
synaptic event has a duration of ~100 ms, and consumes energy on a
scale of ~10 fJ (33). The low energy consumption of the devices is a ben-
efit of (i) the large surface-to-volume ratio of ONWs that improves the
contact area between ONWs and surrounding ion gel and (ii) the short
channel length that significantly shortens the path along which energy
can dissipate (fig. S13 and related discussion) (34). The ion gel is ioni-
cally conductive and electrically insulating, with leakage current orders
of magnitude smaller than that of the semiconducting path in similar
transistor geometries (19), so energy dissipation through the ionic gating
is negligible (19, 35). Spike rate was correlated with EPSC in the short-
channel ST (fig. S14). EPSC could also be increased by applying large-
amplitude presynaptic spikes (fig. S15) or longer-time stimulation (fig.
S16), but this approach requires increase in energy consumption. Nar-
row pulse widththat is in the reasonable range of dopaminergic neurons
in the central brain also triggered EPSC in ONW STs (fig. S17). Further-
more, large-scale 144 STs were fabricated on a 4-inch wafer using the

 highly aligned ONWs (Fig. 4C). To study the transparency of ONWs, we
compared the transmittance of bare polyethylene terephthalate (PET)

CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we used ONW-based electronic devices to emulate the
morphology, working principles, and energy consumption of synaptic
junctions of nerve fibers. Important working principles, such as short-
term plasticity, LTP, and LTD, were emulated in a single electronic
device. These properties are essential for pattern recognition and as-
sociative learning. Extremely low energy consumption of the artificial
synapses was realized by using core-sheath–structured ONWs across a
short nanochannel. The femtojoule-level energy consumption (~1.23 fJ
per synaptic event) rivals that of biological synapses (~10 fJ per syn-
aptic event), and this achievement is a significant step toward fabrica-
tion of brain-inspired electronic devices. This work presents important
progress in the development of high-density and soft brain-inspired
computational systems that consume ultralow amounts of energy.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fabrication of highly aligned ONWs
P3HT [regioregularity, ~90%; weight-average molecular weight (Mw),
~45,570; Sigma-Aldrich] and PEO (Mw, ~400,000; Sigma-Aldrich)
were used to prepare 70:30 (w/w) blend solutions of P3HT/PEO. Tri-
chloroethylene and chlorobenzene were mixed (1:1.5, w/w) and used
as the cosolvent of the P3HT/PEO blend. The blended solution was
injected through a metal nozzle at a feed rate of 800 nl min−1, and
ONWs were formed and aligned on the substrate by using a
homebuilt e-NW printer. The nozzle tip-to-collector distance was
~6.5 mm, and 3.2 kV was applied to the nozzle.
Device fabrication
P3HT/PEO-blend ONWs were drawn on predeposited Ti/Au
source–drain patterns using our home built e-NW printer, which
consists of two major components: an injector and a collector (fig.
S1). The injected polymer solution was stretched into fibers in a high
electric field to arrive at the collector, which was mounted horizon-
tally and can move horizontally with digitally controlled speed and
direction to adapt to the injection speed of the rapidly formed
ONWs and to align the ONWs in desired patterns. Ion gel liquid
composed of poly(styrene-block-methyl methacrylate-block-styrene)
(PS-PMMA-PS) triblock copolymer (36) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl) imide in ethyl acetate (0.7:9.3:90, w/w/w
ratio) was drop-cast to the channel region and vacuum-annealed for
1 hour at room temperature to assist removal of solvent and forma-
tion of gel-like films with physical association of the PS blocks.
Characterization
SEM imaging was performed using a JEOL-6500 field emission mi-
croscope. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy with
electron energy loss spectroscopy results was obtained using the
JEOL JEM-2200FS at the National Institute for Nanomaterials Tech-
nology (Pohang, Republic of Korea). All electrical transport proper-
ties were tested using a probe station in an N2-filled glove box using
a Keithley 4200 semiconductor parameter analyzer.
