Abstract 
33 
Background: a growing number of quantitative studies have investigated the potential 
34 
benefits of outdoor blue spaces (lakes, rivers, sea, etc) and human health, but there is 
35 
not yet a systematic review synthesizing this evidence.  
36 
Objectives: to systematically review the current quantitative evidence on human health 
37 
and well-being benefits of outdoor blue spaces.  
38 
Methods: following PRISMA guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and meta-
39 
analysis, observational and experimental quantitative studies focusing on both 
40 
residential and non-residential outdoor blue space exposure were searched using 
41 
specific keywords.  
42 
Results: in total 35 studies were included in the current systematic review, most of them 
43 
being classified as of “good quality” (N=22). The balance of evidence suggested a 
44 
positive association between greater exposure to outdoor blue spaces and both benefits 
45 
to mental health and well-being (N=12 studies) and levels of physical activity (N=13 
46 
studies). The evidence of an association between outdoor blue space exposure and 
47 
general health (N= 6 studies), obesity (N=8 studies) and cardiovascular (N=4 studies) 
48 
and related outcomes was less consistent.  
49 
Conclusions: although encouraging, there remains relatively few studies and a large 
50 
degree of heterogeneity in terms of study design, exposure metrics and outcome 
51 
measures, making synthesis difficult. Further research is needed using longitudinal 
52 
research and natural experiments, preferably across a broader range of countries, to 
53 
better understand the causal associations between blue spaces, health and wellbeing.

Introduction 
58 
A growing body of literature suggests that natural outdoor environments might help 
59 
reduce stress, promote physical activity and social relationships and potentially improve 
60 
human health and well-being (Dadvand et al., 2016; Hartig et al., 2014; Nieuwenhuijsen 
61 
et al., 2017; Pasanen et al., 2014; Völker and Kistemann, 2011). Furthermore, the 
62 
presence of natural environments in urban settings, particularly green spaces (trees, 
63 
grass, forests, parks, etc), has been associated with a reduction of the levels of air 
64 
pollution and noise, as well as extreme temperatures in cities, which can lead to a 
65 
reduction of the impacts of these environmental factors on our health (Burkart et al., 
66 
2016; Hartig et al., 2014; Shanahan et al., 2015; Wolf and Robbins, 2015). In a world 
67 
with rapid urbanization and pressure on space (United Nations Department of Economic 
68 
and Social Affairs, 2014), evidence of such health benefits of natural environments are 
69 
of high relevance for healthcare professionals, urban planners and policymakers, who 
70 
can help translate available evidence into salutogenic interventions and policies (i.e. 
71 
ones that support and promote health and well-being).  
72 
 
73 
Most of the studies in this field to date have focused on the health benefits of green 
74 
spaces, including several systematic and non-systematic reviews (e.g. Dzhambov et al., 
75 
2014; Dzhambov and Dimitrova, 2014; Gascon et al., 2016, 2015; Kabisch et al., 2015; 
76 
Lee and Maheswaran, 2011; Nieuwenhuijsen et al., 2017; WHO, 2016). However, 
77 
fewer studies have focused on the health impacts of outdoor blue spaces, defined in the 
78 
European Commission funded project BlueHealth (https://bluehealth2020.eu/) as 
79 
“outdoor environments - either natural or manmade - that prominently feature water and 
80 
are accessible to humans either proximally (being in, on, or near water) or 
81 
distally/virtually (being able to see, hear or otherwise sense water)” (Grellier et al., 
82 
 5 
 
2017). Despite a rich and growing body of multi-faceted, qualitative and narrative work 
83 
that is shedding important light on people’s interactions with blue space environments, 
84 
including their perceptions of potential health benefits (Foley and Kistemann, 2015; 
85 
Völker and Kistemann, 2011), we know less about the quantitative, primarily 
86 
epidemiological data that seeks to address questions such as “Is living near or having 
87 
better access to blue space environments associated with positive health and well-being 
88 
outcomes?”. Although one systematic review, focusing on mortality, did seek to explore 
89 
the relationship with blue space, in addition to more commonly researched green space, 
90 
no studies were found at that time to have considered this association (Gascon et al., 
91 
2016). However, we know of far more studies that have looked at blue space and 
92 
morbidity and well-being outcomes although as yet no systematic review of this 
93 
literature has been conducted. The aim of the current paper was to fill this gap. 
94 
Moreover, given that it has been hypothesized that any of the potential benefits to health 
95 
and well-being from exposure to outdoor blue space may follow pathways similar to 
96 
those identified for green space including stress reduction, increased physical activity, 
97 
promotion of positive social contacts, increased place attachment and the reduction of 
98 
extreme temperatures may also play a role for outdoor blue spaces (Grellier et al., 
99 
2017), the current review will explore this potential pathways as well.

Materials and methods 
102 
Search strategy and selection criteria 
103 
We followed the PRISMA statement guidelines for reporting systematic reviews and 
104 
meta-analyses (Moher et al., 2010). The bibliographic search was conducted using 
105 
MEDLINE (National Library of Medicine) and SCOPUS search engines and keywords 
106 
related to outdoor blue spaces (blue space,  river , lake, sea, beach, fountains, riparian, 
107 
 6 
 
oceans, coastal, marine) combined with keywords related to health and well-being 
108 
(mood disorder, depressive disorder,  depression, anxiety disorder, anxiety, obsessive-
109 
compulsive disorder, stress, mental health, mental hygiene, mental disorders, emotional 
110 
well-being, psychological well-being, social well-being,  well-being, cognitive function, 
111 
health, cardiovascular diseases, heart diseases, blood pressure, hypertension, obesity, 
112 
overweigh, weight, body mass index, BMI) as well as keywords related to the potential 
113 
mechanisms accounting for this association (physical activity, social capital, social 
114 
contacts, social support). The search was limited to the English language and studies in 
115 
humans and the last search was conducted on July 1st 2016. All studies published prior 
116 
to that date and that followed the inclusion criteria were included in the systematic 
117 
review. In order to have a potentially global overview, the country where the study had 
118 
been conducted was not an inclusion criterion. Two authors (MG and WZ) 
119 
independently identified and conducted the first screening of the articles based on the 
120 
information available in the title and abstract by using the Rayyan tool (Elmagarmid et 
121 
al., 2014), an online tool that provides procedural support in the selection of articles for 
122 
systematic reviews. After this first screening stage, based on titles and abstracts, both 
123 
authors independently read each article to decide whether or not these were eligible for 
124 
inclusion. After this process, authors compared the final list of papers included by each 
125 
of them and where disagreements or doubts were encountered the final decision was 
126 
resolved by discussion between the two independent researchers. We also checked the 
127 
references of the relevant articles and other sources to find additional articles following 
128 
the inclusion criteria. 
129 
 
130 
Study eligibility criteria and quality of the studies 
131 
 7 
 
The selection criteria were as follows: a) the article needed to be an original research 
132 
article, b) all type of study designs were included (ecological, prospective, cross-
133 
sectional, case-control, and intervention studies), c) the article used quantitative data to 
134 
report analysis of health and well-being, social or physical activity outcomes in relation 
135 
to outdoor blue space exposure, d) outdoor blue space exposure was included as a 
136 
separate variable within the analysis and results were reported specifically for outdoor 
137 
blue space, even if this was not the primary aim of the study. 
138 
 
139 
We extracted the following data: author, year of publication, country, study design, 
140 
study population, sample size, exposure assessment, outcome assessment, confounding 
141 
factors, and other relevant information including information on potential biases (Tables 
142 
1-4 and supplemental material Table A). The data extraction work was conducted by the 
143 
two authors independently, as well as the evaluation of their quality and classification of 
144 
the evidence. Agreement was reached via consensus. Study quality evaluation was 
145 
based on an adapted version of the criteria used in previous reviews in the green space 
146 
field (Gascon et al., 2016, 2015). Further information on how the quality scores were 
147 
given is provided in Table B of the supplemental material. The following quality scores 
148 
(%) were derived as follows (supplemental material Table C): excellent quality (score 
149 
≥81%), good quality (between 61 and 80%), fair quality (between 41 and 60%), poor 
150 
quality (between 21 and 40%) and very poor quality (≤20%). These quality scores 
151 
facilitated establishing the degree of evidence for causal relationships (while 
152 
recognizing that many of these studies are not designed to test causality directly) 
153 
between outdoor blue spaces and the outcomes evaluated. The definitions of the degree 
154 
of evidence for causal relationships used in the current systematic review are an 
155 
adaptation of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) definition to 
156 
 8 
 
define evidence of a causal relationship for cancer (IARC, 2006): sufficient - a positive 
157 
relationship has been observed between the exposure and outcome in most of the 
158 
studies, including good quality studies, in which chance, bias and confounding could be 
159 
ruled out with reasonable confidence; limited - several good quality, independent, 
160 
studies report a statistically significant association, but chance, bias or confounding 
161 
cannot be rule out and therefore evidence is not yet conclusive enough; inadequate - if 
162 
statistically significant associations are reported in one or more studies, but insufficient 
163 
quality, insufficient number of studies, lack of consistency, and/or lack of statistical 
164 
power preclude a conclusion regarding the presence or absence of a causal relationship; 
165 
evidence for lack of association - several good quality studies are consistent in showing 
166 
no causal relationship. We separately evaluated the evidence according to the different 
167 
outcomes assessed in the studies included. 
168 
 
169 
Results 
170 
We identified 2438 articles in MEDLINE and 2380 articles in SCOPUS and 33 through 
171 
other sources. After screening the title and the abstracts and checking for duplicates, 91 
172 
articles were chosen for full-text evaluation, of which 35 articles were finally included 
173 
in the systematic review as these fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Figure 1). 
174 
 
175 
Out of the 35 studies included, 29 had a cross-sectional design, of which three were 
176 
ecological. Five studies were longitudinal and another had a pre-/post-observational 
177 
study design. The quality of 35 the studies was mainly good (N=22), but one study 
178 
received a score of excellent quality, six studies were rated as fair and the remaining six 
179 
studies received a score of poor quality (no study was rated as very poor; supplemental 
180 
material Table C). 
181

182 
All studies, except four, were conducted in high-income countries: twenty-one in 
183 
Europe, including the United Kingdom (n=11), Croatia (N=3), Spain (N=2), France 
184 
(N=2), The Netherlands (N=1), Finland (N=1), Ireland (N=1). The other studies were 
185 
conducted in Australia (N=6), China (N=3), New Zealand (N=2), Canada (N=1), the 
186 
USA (N=1) and Yemen (N=1). Additionally, most studies included in this review were 
187 
published in the last five years (N=24). 
188 
 
189 
Outdoor blue space exposure assessment 
190 
Regarding outdoor blue space exposure assessment we evaluated different aspects: 
191 
outdoor blue space type (whether the outdoor blue space was inland – rivers, lakes, 
192 
ponds, streams, rivulets, wetlands, fresh waters - or non-inland – including coast, beach, 
193 
and salt waters), the environment of assessment (residential, school, leisure, etc.) and 
194 
the method used to evaluate exposure to outdoor blue spaces (Figure 2). For all three 
195 
aspects there was a high heterogeneity among studies. 
196 
 
197 
Inland, non-inland outdoor blue space 
198 
Most studies only focused on salt water and/or the coast (N=20), while others combined 
199 
fresh and salt water surfaces or inland and non-inland outdoor blue spaces in the 
200 
analysis (N=11). Only four were limited to only freshwater (Table 1, 2, 3 and 4). 
201 
 
202 
Outdoor blue space environment of assessment 
203 
Most studies (N=28) focused on outdoor blue space exposure around individuals’ 
204 
residential area. Exceptions included three studies evaluating the use of outdoor blue 
205 
spaces in general (Amoly et al., 2014; Elliott et al., 2015; White et al., 2013c), a study 
206 
 10 
 
evaluating running routes (Rogerson et al., 2016), a study that focused on exposure to 
207 
water bodies (e.g. oceans, lakes, rivers, streams) 5 km around schools (in addition to 
208 
home residence (Huynh et al., 2013), a study that used school location as a proxy for 
209 
home location (Gilmer et al., 2003), and a time-series study evaluating the real-time use 
210 
of different spaces, including outdoor blue spaces (MacKerron and Mourato, 2013).  
211 
 
212 
Method of evaluation 
213 
Six studies used land-cover or land-use maps and GIS techniques to define the 
214 
percentage of outdoor blue spaces surface within a defined area (e.g. buffer or census 
215 
area unit) (Alcock et al., 2015; de Vries et al., 2003; Huynh et al., 2013; Karusisi et al., 
216 
2012; Wheeler et al., 2015; White et al., 2013a). Two further studies used the land-
217 
cover and land-use maps to define the presence/absence of blue space water 
218 
environments within a particular buffer (Perchoux et al., 2015; Triguero-Mas et al., 
219 
2015). Another common approach, also using land-cover and land-use maps and GIS-
220 
techniques, was measuring the distance between the residence, neighbourhood or school 
221 
of the participants and the edge of outdoor blue space of interest (e.g. coastline); some 
222 
studies evaluated linear distance (Brereton et al., 2008; Halonen et al., 2014; Wheeler et 
223 
al., 2012; White et al., 2014, 2013b; Wood et al., 2016; Ying et al., 2015) and others 
224 
network distance (Edwards et al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2011) or travelling time (Witten 
225 
et al., 2008). GIS-techniques and land-cover maps were also used to define whether the 
226 
study subjects lived in a coastal neighborhood (Ball et al., 2007). Three studies defined 
227 
coastal vs. inland residence based on the postal code (Bauman et al., 1999; Humpel et 
228 
al., 2004a, 2004b), whereas seven other studies defined exposure to coast based on 
229 
whether the region of the country or the state had coast or not (Bergovec et al., 2008; 
230 
Gilmer et al., 2003; Kern et al., 2009; Modesti et al., 2013; Qin et al., 2013; Turek et al., 
231 
 11 
 
2001; Zhang et al., 2014). The three studies that used questionnaires as the tool to 
232 
define outdoor blue space exposure assessed the time spent in blue spaces (Amoly et al., 
233 
2014; Elliott et al., 2015; White et al., 2013c), whereas MacKerron and Mourato 
234 
evaluated real-time exposure to outdoor blue spaces based on a smartphone application 
235 
with geolocation linked to a land-cover map (MacKerron and Mourato, 2013). Nutsford 
236 
et al. created an index, named Vertical Visibility Index (VVI), which takes into account 
237 
different aspects of the built environment to define visibility of outdoor blue spaces (or 
238 
any other type of natural space) from the residence of the participants, in this case 
239 
within a buffer of 15 km (Nutsford et al., 2016). Rogerson et al. evaluated exposure to 
240 
outdoor blue spaces by recruiting runners using the routes that included the beach or the 
241 
river, and who were therefore considered to be exposed (Rogerson et al., 2016). Finally, 
242 
Wheeler et al. also factored in freshwater quality, as well as quantity, using an index 
243 
created by the Environmental Agency for England and Wales (Wheeler et al., 2015).  
244 
 
245 
Outcomes 
246 
General health 
247 
General health was evaluated in six studies (Table 1) (de Vries et al., 2003; Triguero-
248 
Mas et al., 2015; Wheeler et al., 2015, 2012; White et al., 2013b; Ying et al., 2015). In 
249 
four of these studies information on perceived general health and well-being was self-
250 
reported by the participants and was based on one single question (which is supposed to 
251 
have a strong association with more complex dimensions of physical and psychological 
252 
health) (de Vries et al., 2003; Wheeler et al., 2015, 2012; White et al., 2013b). The 
253 
study by de Vries et al. additionally asked for the number of symptoms experienced in 
254 
the last 14 days (a maximum of 43 health symptoms, including e.g. headaches, fatigue, 
255 
cough) (de Vries et al., 2003). A study conducted in Spain used the Short Form health 
256 
 12 
 
survey (SF-36) to define perceived general health (Triguero-Mas et al., 2015), whereas 
257 
a study of the Chinese population asked the question “How do you feel about your 
258 
health status?” (Ying et al., 2015) (Table 1). 
259 
 
260 
Results for self-reported general health were heterogeneous; two ecological cross-
261 
sectional studies reported better perceived general health in relation to outdoor blue 
262 
spaces (Wheeler et al., 2015, 2012). The first study observed this association among 
263 
those living in urban areas less than 1 km from the coast compared to those living more 
264 
than 50 km away, but not among those living in smaller towns or rural areas (Wheeler et 
265 
al., 2012). The second study observed beneficial effects among those subjects with a 
266 
higher percentage of salt and coastal water in their census area. However, no 
267 
associations were observed with freshwater (Wheeler et al., 2015). A longitudinal study 
268 
also reported better perceived general health among the same individuals when they 
269 
lived less than 5 km from the coast compared to years when they lived further inland 
270 
(White et al., 2013b). However, three cross-sectional studies reported no associations 
271 
between perceived general health and the percentage of fresh or salt water present 
272 
within a 3 km buffer (de Vries et al., 2003) or access to inland and non-inland outdoor 
273 
blue spaces in buffers between 100 m and 1 km (Triguero-Mas et al., 2015; Ying et al., 
274 
2015). Although the pioneering de Vries (2003) study did not observe associations with 
275 
perceived general health, it did observe a reduction in the number of symptoms reported 
276 
by the participants associated with the percentage of fresh and salt water (de Vries et al., 
277 
2003). Finally, Wheeler et al. also evaluated whether ecological quality of freshwater 
278 
was associated with better perceived general health; however, they observed an inverse 
279 
association (Wheeler et al., 2015) (Table 1).  
280 
 
281 
 13 
 
Based on the few studies available, the quality of the studies, the heterogeneity in both 
282 
study design and results obtained (Table 1), we classified the evidence of an association 
283 
between outdoor blue space exposure and general health as ‘inadequate’ to make a firm 
284 
conclusion for either inland or coastal waters at this time. 
285 
 
286 
Mental health and well-being 
287 
Mental health and well-being was evaluated in twelve studies (Alcock et al., 2015; 
288 
Amoly et al., 2014; Brereton et al., 2008; de Vries et al., 2003; Huynh et al., 2013; 
289 
MacKerron and Mourato, 2013; Nutsford et al., 2016; Rogerson et al., 2016; Triguero-
290 
Mas et al., 2015; White et al., 2013b, 2013c, 2013a) (Table 2). Tools to evaluate mental 
291 
health varied substantially; five studies used the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ) 
292 
(Alcock et al., 2015; de Vries et al., 2003; Triguero-Mas et al., 2015; White et al., 
293 
2013a, 2013b), with remaining studies using a variety of validated questionnaires 
294 
measuring behavioral and emotional problems, well-being, self-esteem, mood, 
295 
perceived stress, and psychological distress (Table 2). Six studies used either widely 
296 
utilized single item measures of well-being e.g. life satisfaction (Brereton et al., 2008; 
297 
White et al., 2013a, 2013b), happiness (MacKerron and Mourato, 2013) with unknown 
298 
validity; constructed original scales based on the content of existing surveys e.g. 
299 
recalled mental restoration (White et al., 2013c) or perceived depression or anxiety, and 
300 
visits to mental health specialists and medication intake (Triguero-Mas et al., 2015), 
301 
within untested psychometric properties.  
302 
 
303 
Three of the five studies using the GHQ to evaluate mental health did not observe 
304 
associations with the percentage of residential fresh or salt water within the area of 
305 
study (de Vries et al., 2003; White et al., 2013a) or access to inland and non-inland 
306 
 14 
 
outdoor blue spaces between 100 m and 1 km (Triguero-Mas et al., 2015). Triguero-
307 
Mas et al. also failed to find a significant association with perceived depression or 
308 
anxiety, visits to mental health specialists or medication intake (tranquilizers, 
309 
antidepressants, sleeping medication) (Triguero-Mas et al., 2015). However, two other 
310 
studies, both using data from an 18 year longitudinal survey in the UK, reported 
311 
positive associations; the first study observed that people’s mental health was better in 
312 
years when they lived less than 5 km from the coast, compared to years when they were 
313 
living further inland (White et al., 2013b). The second study, including residents from 
314 
rural areas, found that while greater exposure to purely coastal areas was again 
315 
associated with better GHQ scores (over time), quantities of saltwater (estuaries) was 
316 
associated with worse GHQ scores (over time) (Alcock et al., 2015).These differences 
317 
were found for people moving between different areas over time, while cross-sectional 
318 
analyses did not reveal any significant patterns (similarly to most cross-section 
319 
findings), suggesting that moving location (to ones with more or less blue space) may 
320 
affect outcomes, but that people may adapt in the long-term so that these differences 
321 
wash-out over time. White et al. additionally evaluated life satisfaction as a proxy for 
322 
well-being, but the authors did not observe associations with residential coastal or 
323 
freshwater distance (White et al., 2013a, 2013b). A third study including life 
324 
satisfaction reported that those individuals living <2km from the coast were more 
325 
satisfied with their life than those living >5km. No associations were observed with 
326 
distances between 2 and 5 km and with residential distance from the beach (Brereton et 
327 
al., 2008). Nutsford et al. reported a reduction of psychological distress with increasing 
328 
outdoor blue space (oceanic and freshwater) visibility from the home in a buffer of 15 
329 
km (Nutsford et al., 2016). Finally, Huyhn et al. used the percentage of water bodies 
330 
within a 5 km buffer around schools to define exposure to outdoor blue spaces in 
331 
 15 
 
children aged 11 to 16 years (Huynh et al., 2013). The study observed that increasing 
332 
exposure to water bodies increased emotional well-being, even after excluding children 
333 
living outside the 5 km buffer around the schools (Huynh et al., 2013) (Table 2). 
334 
 
335 
Three studies evaluated the effects of time spent at the beach (Amoly et al., 2014) or 
336 
any blue space (MacKerron and Mourato, 2013; White et al., 2013c). The first study 
337 
observed that children (7-10 years) whose parents reported spending more time at the 
338 
beach during the year had less emotional problems and more pro-social behavior, but no 
339 
associations were found with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 
340 
symptoms (Amoly et al., 2014). The second study used GPS and a smartphone 
341 
application for geolocalization, as well as a real-time questionnaire about happiness, 
342 
which the same individuals completed in many different locations. The results showed 
343 
that individuals were happier when they reported being in marine and coastal areas, as 
344 
well as freshwater, wetlands and flood plains than when they were in any other type of 
345 
urban or rural setting (MacKerron and Mourato, 2013) (Table 2). The third study 
346 
reported that adolescents and adults spending more time at the beach or the coast had 
347 
better recalled restoration than urban green spaces (i.e. felt more relaxed/refreshed). 
348 
However, this association was not statistically significant among those spending more 
349 
time at inland waters such as rivers, lakes or canals (White et al., 2013c).  
350 
 
351 
Finally, in a pre-/post-observational study, Rogerson et al. did not observe significant 
352 
differences in self-esteem, perceived stress or mood between runners running along 
353 
beach or riverside routes compared to those running along other routes called the 
354 
“grass” and the “heritage” routes before and after the running (Rogerson et al., 2016) 
355 
(Table 2). 
356 
 16 
 
 
357 
Although some good quality studies reported an association between residential and the 
358 
use of outdoor blue spaces and mental health and well-being, the number of studies is 
359 
still limited and there is heterogeneity in study design and results among and within 
360 
them (Table 2). We therefore feel that, based on the classification criteria defined, the 
361 
most appropriate classification is ‘limited’ for both inland and coastal waters. 
362 
 
363 
Physical activity 
364 
Thirteen cross-sectional studies focused on the promotion of physical activity (Ball et 
365 
al., 2007; Bauman et al., 1999; Edwards et al., 2014; Elliott et al., 2015; Gilmer et al., 
366 
2003; Humpel et al., 2004a, 2004b; Karusisi et al., 2012; Perchoux et al., 2015; White et 
367 
al., 2014; Wilson et al., 2011; Witten et al., 2008; Ying et al., 2015) (Table 3). Six of 
368 
these studies used non-validated questionnaires, or at least the validation was not 
369 
reported, whereas the other seven studies used validated tools. Two of these studies 
370 
used the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) (Ball et al., 2007; 
371 
Humpel et al., 2004b), another the Youth Health Survey (YHS) (Gilmer et al., 2003), 
372 
Edwards et al. used the Adolescent Physical Activity Recall Questionnaire (APARQ) 
373 
(Edwards et al., 2014) and Ying et al. used a pedometer (Ying et al., 2015). Wilson et 
374 
al. reported previous validation of the questionnaire, but only in a sample of middle-
375 
aged women (Wilson et al., 2011), and Bauman et al. also referred to validity and 
376 
reliability studies for the questionnaire used (Bauman et al., 1999) (Table 3). 
377 
Additionally, six of the studies defined exposure based on a relatively coarse assessment 
378 
of proximity to coastal areas (Ball et al., 2007; Bauman et al., 1999; Gilmer et al., 2003; 
379 
Humpel et al., 2004a, 2004b; Wood et al., 2016), and not on the actual distance between 
380 
the coastal areas and the address of residence of the participants (Table 3). 
381 
 17 
 
 
382 
The studies using this relatively coarse exposure assessment obtained diverse results; 
383 
Ball et al. reported increasing leisure-time and transport walking among adult women 
384 
living in coastal suburbs (Ball et al., 2007). Bauman et al. also reported a higher 
385 
likelihood of having a less sedentary lifestyle and achieving an adequate weekly energy 
386 
expenditure or high levels of physical activity among those adults who lived near the 
387 
coast (Bauman et al., 1999). However, two other studies including adults did not report 
388 
associations between living in a coastal area and levels of physical activity (Humpel et 
389 
al., 2004a, 2004b); only two statistically significant associations were observed in these 
390 
two studies among the several results reported for men and women separately (Table 3). 
391 
Finally, a study including youth aged 11-14 years with a parental history of premature 
392 
coronary heart disease reported statistically significantly lower levels of mean physical 
393 
activity among youth living in coastal areas compared to non-coastal areas (Gilmer et 
394 
al., 2003). 
395 
 
396 
In a French cross-sectional study involving adults from 30 to 79 years of age the 
397 
percentage of inland water in a buffer of 1 km from the residence was associated with 
398 
reporting jogging behavior in the previous week (Karusisi et al., 2012). Some years later 
399 
a similar methodology was applied, but in this case the exposure was defined as the 
400 
presence of lakes or waterways in different spaces (residential, recreational, work, 
401 
groceries, social and services) and buffers (Table 3) and the outcome was the reporting 
402 
of recreational walking in the previous week (Perchoux et al., 2015). The results 
403 
showed that subjects with access to residential and/or recreational blue spaces were less 
404 
likely to not report recreation walking in the previous week. However, when outdoor 
405 
blue spaces from all types of space were included in the analysis no association was 
406 
 18 
 
observed (Perchoux et al., 2015) (Table 3). In another study distance from the beach, 
407 
measured as the driving travel time to access the nearest beach, was not associated with 
408 
meeting the recommended levels of physical activity (at least 2.5 h on five or more days 
409 
over the preceding week) in adolescents and adults above 15 years of age (Witten et al., 
410 
2008). However, those living between 9.2 and 31.8 min from the beach were more 
411 
likely to report a sedentary behavior profile (< 30 min of physical activity in the past 
412 
week) compared to those living less than 9.2 min. No associations were observed 
413 
among those living further than 31.8 min walking distance to the coast (Witten et al., 
414 
2008). A study including adults of 40 to 65 years of age in Australia reported that living 
415 
in a shorter network distance to the river or the coast was associated with spending more 
416 
time walking for recreation (≥ 300 min/week) (Wilson et al., 2011). However, a similar 
417 
study in China reported no associations between living within 500m from the river and 
418 
physical activity measured with a pedometer (Ying et al., 2015). Again in Australia, 
419 
Edwards et al. observed that rural adolescents reporting the use of the beach for physical 
420 
activity were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines both in summer and 
421 
winter, and that those living more than 800m from the beach were less likely to report 
422 
using the beach for physical activity than those living less than 800m (Edwards et al., 
423 
2014). Related to visits to blue spaces and levels of physical activity, a study showed 
424 
that living <1km from the coast statistically significantly increased the likelihood of 
425 
doing 30 minutes or more of physical activity at least 5 days a week compared to those 
426 
living more than 20 km from the coast. The study also showed that this association was 
427 
mediated by the number of coastal visits and that coastal visits were associated to 
428 
residential distance from the coast (White et al., 2014). Elliott et al. also reported 
429 
increased levels of physical activity (MET minutes based on activity and duration of the 
430 
 19 
 
activity) among those who visited coastal areas (seaside resort and other coastal visits) 
431 
compared to inland urban and rural green spaces (Elliott et al., 2015). 
432 
 
433 
Despite the heterogeneity in relation to the study design, mainly in exposure and 
434 
outcome assessment, most of the studies (N=8/13) were of good quality.  Five of these 
435 
good quality studies reported increasing levels of physical activity with increasing 
436 
exposure to outdoor blue spaces (Table 3). Nevertheless, despite this relatively 
437 
consistent association, we classified the evidence for an association as ‘limited’ given 
438 
the methodological heterogeneities between studies. This classification of the evidence 
439 
was mainly for non-inland waters, as most of the studies evaluated only beach and 
440 
coastal areas (N=9/13). 
441 
 
442 
Obesity and cardiovascular related outcomes 
443 
Eight studies evaluated obesity related outcomes in relation to blue spaces (Table 4). 
444 
The only longitudinal study (8 years of follow-up) evaluating the relationship between 
445 
residential distance to blue spaces (lakes, rivers or sea) and overweight and obesity did 
446 
not find a significant pattern of associations, either among people who moved home 
447 
residence over the time or those who did not (Halonen et al., 2014). Two cross-sectional 
448 
studies comparing adults of coastal and non-coastal areas also failed to find any 
449 
associations with abdominal obesity (Modesti et al., 2013) or statistically significant 
450 
differences in BMI between regions (Turek et al., 2001). However, two Chinese studies 
451 
with a similar study design to those of Modesti et al. and Turek et al. obtained 
452 
heterogeneous results; Qin et al. reported increased risk of overweight, obesity and 
453 
abdominal obesity among hypertensive adults aged 45-75 years living inland compared 
454 
to those living in the coastal county, whereas Zhang et al. reported higher prevalence of 
455 
 20 
 
abdominal obesity among children (7-18 years) living in coastal districts. Ying et al. 
456 
found no association between living within 500m distance from a river and BMI 
457 
(continuous variable) in adults (40-80 years), but did find increased overweight/obesity 
458 
(as compared to normal weight participants) in this range. In the cross-sectional study of 
459 
Witten et al., where the estimated driving time to the nearest beach was used as a proxy 
460 
for the distance to the beach, the BMI (self-reported) of adolescents and adults was 
461 
higher among those living further (>31.8 min) from the beach compared to those living 
462 
less than 31.8 min (Witten et al., 2008). A second study, of ecological design, observed 
463 
that children living less than 1 km from the coast in England had a lower BMI than 
464 
those living further (more than 20 km) (Wood et al., 2016) (Table 4). 
465 
 
466 
Four cross-sectional studies also evaluated other outcomes related to cardiovascular 
467 
disease and diabetes (Table 4). All of these studies based exposure on the region of 
468 
residence of study subjects (coastal and non-coastal areas). Regarding hypertension, one 
469 
study reported reduced hypertension among adult coronary heart disease patients in 
470 
hospitals located in coastal areas (Bergovec et al., 2008). However, another study 
471 
reported increased risk of hypertension among residents of coastal areas (Modesti et al., 
472 
2013) and the other study only reported statistically significant differences in 
473 
hypertension prevalence in four different regions, but no gradient in distance to the 
474 
coast (Turek et al., 2001). Finally, Kern et al. defined cardiovascular risk burden 
475 
(CVRB) based on several cardiovascular factors (Table 4). The authors observed 
476 
differences between regions, reporting higher prevalence of CVRB among those living 
477 
in the continental regions compared to those living in the coastal region, particularly 
478 
among women (Table 4) (Kern et al., 2009).  
479 
 
480 
 21 
 
No associations or statistically significant differences were reported in relation to 
481 
cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the two studies that evaluated the relationship with 
482 
blue spaces (Bergovec et al., 2008; Turek et al., 2001). Only a reduced risk of decreased 
483 
high-density lipoproteins (HDL) – they transport fat molecules out of artery walls to the 
484 
liver - was observed in one of the studies (Bergovec et al., 2008). No associations with 
485 
blue space proximity and diabetes were observed in the two studies that investigated 
486 
this association (Bergovec et al., 2008; Modesti et al., 2013) (Table 4). 
487 
 
488 
Given the very limited number of studies examining these outcomes and high 
489 
heterogeneity in the study design and in the results obtained, we classified the evidence 
490 
supporting a causal relationship between exposure to blue spaces and cardiovascular 
491 
disease and diabetes as ‘inadequate’. 
492 
 
493 
Discussion 
494 
In the present review we evaluated the current quantitative evidence on the relationship 
495 
between exposure to outdoor blue space environments such as rivers, lakes and the 
496 
coast, with a range of health and well-being outcomes. The 35 studies that were selected 
497 
used a wide range of exposures and outcomes. The body of evidence suggested a 
498 
positive association between exposure to outdoor blue spaces and mental health and 
499 
well-being and the promotion of physical activity; however the evidence of any direct 
500 
causation was ‘limited’. The evidence of an association between outdoor blue space and 
501 
general health was even weaker, as was the evidence with respect to obesity and 
502 
cardiovascular related outcomes, in part due to the paucity of studies to date. Further, 
503 
the review found a large degree of heterogeneity across studies in terms of design, 
504 
 22 
 
exposures, outcomes assessed and measurement tools, preventing any possibility of 
505 
conducting meta-analysis. 
506 
 
507 
Study design 
508 
Most of the studies included in the review were of cross-sectional design, which are of 
509 
course unable to rule out reverse causation (e.g. those with better mental health are more 
510 
likely to move to areas with high residential blue space exposure). Indeed, some of 
511 
these studies were ecological, a design open to the ecological fallacy, and very few were 
512 
used longitudinal data. Furthermore, the study evaluating pre- and post- exposure 
513 
measurement had a number of study design limitations (Rogerson et al., 2016). For 
514 
instance, study participants were people already running in each of the routes 
515 
established, and these same people did not run along the other routes (Rogerson et al., 
516 
2016). Overall, there is a need for more well-designed longitudinal and intervention 
517 
studies. 
518 
 
519 
Outdoor blue spaces exposure assessment and other urban determinants 
520 
The present review highlights the high heterogeneity among studies considering outdoor 
521 
blue spaces exposure assessment. In order to facilitate comparability between studies 
522 
and meta-analyses, efforts to conduct common approaches are recommended in future. 
523 
To this end we suggest a number of things which could be considered in the future. 
524 
First, although the main interest of a particular study was usually one type of outdoor 
525 
blue space (e.g. % of or distance to seawater), other types of outdoor blue spaces could 
526 
(perhaps even should) be included in the analysis as well (e.g. % inland water), to 
527 
simultaneously explore multiple blue spaces, and reduce potential confounding across 
528 
blue space types and aid comparability across more studies. Also, as green spaces are a 
529 
 23 
 
significant part of natural environments and are often highly correlated with outdoor 
530 
blue spaces and the outcomes of interest, green spaces should also be included in the 
531 
analysis (see supplemental material Table A for studies in the current review that did do 
532 
this), to clarify how the two exposures potentially interact or play the largest role. Other 
533 
characteristics of blue spaces also need greater consideration in future work, e.g. ease of 
534 
accessibility to a particular outdoor blue space (e.g. presence of busy roads, high slopes, 
535 
etc) or degree of urbanity. This would provide more accurate information on the actual 
536 
potential exposure to a particular outdoor blue space. Another important aspect to 
537 
consider is the inclusion of the actual use (and the type of uses) of outdoor blue spaces 
538 
in order to more accurately estimate actual exposure. Finally, one aspect that limits the 
539 
inference of long-term effects of outdoor blue spaces is the fact that some of the studies 
540 
did not take into account residential history (e.g. most did not report whether or not 
541 
respondents had been living in their current home for at least 12 months). On a related 
542 
point, even in the few longitudinal studies it was assumed that blue spaces were 
543 
constant over time but there may have been important changes in terms of the 
544 
development of reservoirs, changes in river courses or coastlines which may have 
545 
altered proximity for access to blue spaces within a given residential area over time. 
546 
Again, blue space studies should try and capture these longitudinal changes in 
547 
exposures when possible although we recognize that this is often difficult (Pearce et al., 
548 
2016). Additionally, linkage of (historical) residential information to clinical databases 
549 
or cohort data provide great opportunities for blue health research and environmental 
550 
epidemiology in general, but researchers and data providers should be aware of 
551 
potential privacy issues associated with geographic data (Bovenberg et al., 2016). It 
552 
should also be acknowledged that many studies were using a relatively coarse 
553 
assessment of coastal proximity (e.g. living in a coastal area or non-coastal area) and 
554 
 24 
 
there was also considerable heterogeneity in blue space measurement limiting our 
555 
ability to make direct comparison across studies or conduct meta-analyses. Future 
556 
research would benefit from more standardized percentage of land cover buffers and/or 
557 
network distance parameters.  
558 
 
559 
Outcome assessment 
560 
Our literature search resulted in studies focusing on various outcomes: general health, 
561 
mental health, physical activity, obesity and cardiovascular related outcomes. Many 
562 
studies included in the present review used non-validated questionnaires, especially 
563 
studies which focused on physical activity. In this sense, future studies should make use 
564 
of existing standardized and validated questionnaires, although we recognize that much 
565 
of this literature is relying on secondary datasets which the authors may not be able to 
566 
influence in terms of item inclusion. Furthermore, in the case of physical activity, 
567 
nowadays GIS techniques, apps and smartphones allow researchers to obtain more 
568 
accurate estimates of both physical activity and exposure through processes of 
569 
geospatial linkages (Bell et al., 2015; Bort-Roig et al., 2014; Donaire-Gonzalez et al., 
570 
2013) or real-time information on different health outcomes, as done by MacKerron et 
571 
al. (MacKerron and Mourato, 2013). Tools evaluating the use of the outdoor blue spaces 
572 
and the levels of physical activity conducted around or in these spaces are also an 
573 
interesting option (McKenzie et al., 2006).  
574 
 
575 
Mediators 
576 
As stated in the introduction, stress, physical activity, social contacts and place 
577 
attachment, and the reduction of extreme temperatures, are potential pathways of the 
578 
association between outdoor blue spaces and health and well-being indicators. In the 
579 
 25 
 
present review only one article attempted to examine mediation (i.e. visit frequency as a 
580 
function of coastal proximity, White et al. 2014), and thus far more work is needed in 
581 
order to understand whether certain health determinants could explain the associations 
582 
observed between outdoor blue spaces and health. Indeed, a recent systematic review on 
583 
green spaces and mental health highlighted that some of the included studies observed 
584 
that the health benefits of green spaces could be mediated by some of these variables 
585 
(Gascon et al., 2015). Including these analyses would help understand the mechanisms 
586 
of the association between outdoor blue spaces and health.  
587 
 
588 
Effect modifiers 
589 
It is also necessary to identify specific populations that could benefit more from urban 
590 
planning actions (i.e. neighbourhoods of lower socioeconomic positions, women, 
591 
children, elderly,  etc.), in order to reduce health inequalities (WHO, 2012). In fact, 
592 
Wheeler et al. conducted such analyses and observed that beneficial effects of outdoor 
593 
blue spaces were largest in lower socioeconomic areas (Wheeler et al., 2015, 2012) but 
594 
none of the other studies in this review explored this issue. 
595 
 
596 
Limitations of this review 
597 
Although we believe this is the first systematic review in this area and we endeavored to 
598 
use standard reviewing and grading protocols, we also recognize several limitations. 
599 
First, the concept of “blue space” has not been widely used compared to, for instance, 
600 
green space. In the present review we used search terms based on the keywords and title 
601 
words used in the articles that we already knew about on the topic. However, at the end, 
602 
and despite the efforts to find all relevant articles, only 18 of the 35 articles included in 
603 
the review were found through the traditional online search databases; the rest were 
604 
 26 
 
obtained through other means such as searching citations of included papers, which may 
605 
have resulted in some key papers being missed. The causes for not detecting half of the 
606 
papers through the standard research tools could be that: 1) the blue spaces concept, in 
607 
contrast with green spaces, is not a common concept; or that 2) some studies were not 
608 
directly designed to evaluate health impacts of outdoor “blue exposure” but rather of 
609 
several urban characteristics, and did not focus on these relationships in titles or 
610 
abstracts despite having examined them. In this sense, the BlueHealth project aims to 
611 
explore this concept and to provide recognition and importance to these spaces, both in 
612 
research and in the implementation of policies to promote and protect public health. We 
613 
also recognize that scoring the quality of the papers and classifying the evidence is 
614 
associated with a degree of subjectivity (e.g. “was there careful consideration of 
615 
confounders” is open to interpretation). In the present review, in order to reduce 
616 
subjectivity and bias within the review process itself, two independent reviewers 
617 
conducted the quality appraisal of each paper independently and disagreements 
618 
discussed between the two reviewers, but again some bias may still have occurred. Even 
619 
if this was the case, however, we do not feel that the overall conclusions from our 
620 
review would substantially change if certain studies were reclassified as from fair to 
621 
poor or good and vice versa, given the few number of available studies and the 
622 
heterogeneity among them regarding study design. We also of course recognize the 
623 
possibility of publication bias, which may be inflating the number of positive 
624 
associations in the extant literature. 
625 
 
626 
Other aspects to be considered 
627 
For this systematic review we decided to exclude qualitative research, as we aimed to 
628 
focus on those studies quantifying the health impacts of blue spaces. However, we still 
629 
 27 
 
think it is important to recognize the existing qualitative evidence in this field of 
630 
research, which already suggests a range of benefits of being exposed to blue spaces 
631 
(Finlay et al., 2015; Foley, 2015; Foley and Kistemann, 2015; Kearns et al., 2015; 
632 
Völker and Kistemann, 2015, 2011), and indeed, addresses aspects that quantitative 
633 
research often cannot or does not evaluate, such as perception, sensory exposure, or 
634 
experiences that could explain the associations found by those studies conducting 
635 
quantitative research. Moreover, this type of research is very relevant and should also be 
636 
considered by policy makers when conducting interventions in urban or natural 
637 
environments involving blue spaces.  
638 
 
639 
In the current systematic review none of the studies addressed potential negative 
640 
impacts of blue spaces or aspects related to blue spaces (e.g. drowning, pollution, 
641 
flooding, etc). Far more work has been conducted on these issues already, which is why 
642 
we focus on the benefits here, but there is no doubt that when a more complete picture 
643 
of the benefits emerges it will be time to conduct the kind of full cost-benefit analyses 
644 
usually required by policy makers (Grellier et al., 2017). 
645 
 
646 
Finally, the relationship that people establish with blue spaces can be different across 
647 
cultures and climates worldwide, and therefore blue spaces may have different 
648 
meanings, functions and impacts on health and well-being. In the current review we 
649 
included studies from different countries, but studies from the United Kingdom and 
650 
Australia represented a large part of the included studies (49%). Therefore, our 
651 
conclusions must be tentative at this point given the possibility of inherent “cultural 
652 
bias”. In this sense, international projects like BlueHealth, in which the same 
653 
approaches and methodologies are applied in many countries or geographical areas at 
654 
 28 
 
once, may help to better understand any cultural similarities or differences, and what 
655 
role climatic factors may play in these issues. 
656 
 
657 
Conclusion 
658 
As far as we are aware, this is the first systematic review of quantitative studies on 
659 
outdoor blue spaces and human health and well-being. Results indicate this is emerging 
660 
topic, as most of the studies have been conducted in the last five years. Also, results 
661 
suggest potential health benefits of outdoor blue spaces, mainly with respect to mental 
662 
health and well-being and the promotion of physical activity. However, further studies, 
663 
with methodological improvements, standardized exposure and outcome measures 
664 
enabling comparison across cultures and climates, and including urban health 
665 
determinants other than outdoor blue spaces are needed in order to advance in our 
666 
knowledge on the topic. Despite the limitations, current scientific evidence supports the 
667 
promotion and recovery of outdoor blue spaces within urban planning as an interesting 
668 
strategy for the promotion of health and well-being.

NA=not applicable 
aFor each study the total score was calculated by adding the scores of the 10 dimensions defined and expressing them as a percentage of the maximum score (for some studies 
some of the items did not apply to be evaluated (NA) so the maximum score could vary among studies). Based on the score in %, the following quality scores were obtained: 
Excellent quality (score ≥81%), good quality (between 61 and 80%), fair quality (between 41 and 60%), poor quality (between 21 and 40%) and very poor quality (≤20%) 
bKern et al. gets a “0” for outcome assessment because the methods for outcome measurements are not clearly reported.   
cRogerson et al. gets a “0” for study design because it is a pre-/post-natural intervention study, without controls and several flaws in the design.
