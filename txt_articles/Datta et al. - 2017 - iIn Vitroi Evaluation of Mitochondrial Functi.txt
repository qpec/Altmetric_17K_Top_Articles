BACKGROUND: Quaternary ammonium salts (QUATS), such as cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and benzalkonium chloride (BAK), are frequently
used in antiseptic formulations, including toothpastes, mouthwashes, lozenges, throat and nasal sprays, and as biocides. Although in a recent ruling,
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned CPC from certain products and requested more data on BAK’s efficacy and safety profile,
QUATS, in general, and CPC and BAK, in particular, continue to be used in personal health care, food, and pharmaceutical and cleaning
industries.
OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess CPC's effects on mitochondrial toxicity and endocrine disruption in vitro.
METHOD: Mitochondrial O2 consumption and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis rates of osteosarcoma cybrid cells were measured before and
after CPC and BAK treatment. Antiestrogenic effects of the compounds were measured by a luciferase-based assay using recombinant human breast
carcinoma cells (VM7Luc4E2, ERalpha-positive).
RESULTS: CPC inhibited both mitochondrial O2 consumption [half maximal inhibitory concentration ðIC50Þ: 3:8 lM] and ATP synthesis (IC50:
0:9 lM), and additional findings supported inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1 as the underlying mechanism for these effects. In addition, CPC
showed concentration-dependent antiestrogenic activity half maximal effective concentration [(EC50): 4:5 lM)]. BAK, another antimicrobial QUATS
that is structurally similar to CPC, and the pesticide rotenone, a known complex 1 inhibitor, also showed mitochondrial inhibitory and antiestrogenic
effects. In all three cases, there was overlap of the antiestrogenic activity with the mitochondrial inhibitory activity.
CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial inhibition in vitro occurred at a CPC concentration that may be relevant to human exposures. The antiestrogenic activity
of CPC, BAK, rotenone, and triclosan may be related to their mitochondrial inhibitory activity. Our findings support the need for additional research
on the mitochondrial inhibitory and antiestrogenic effects of QUATS, including CPC and BAK. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1404
Introduction
Antimicrobial quaternary ammonium salts (QUATS) compounds,
such as cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) and benzalkonium chlo-
ride (BAK), have been used in personal care products, such as
soaps and body washes, until the recent U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) ruling (FDA 2016), and are currently
being used in hand lotions, toothpastes, mouthwashes, nasal
sprays, lozenges, deodorants, intravaginal sponges, and in multi-
dose pharmaceutical formulations, such as eye drops (Lang et al.
2013; Tan et al. 2002). The antimicrobial properties of QUATS
were first discovered in the 1930s, and since then, they have been
widely used as topical antiseptics and disinfectants (Tischer et al.
2012). In general, the QUATS are a group of compounds that
contains a positively charged nitrogen atom in their otherwise
lipophilic chemical structures, and these structural characteris-
tics (lipophilic cations) make them favorable to be taken up
by mitochondria (Murphy and Smith 2007). Some of the
QUATS, such as dequalinium chloride (Gamboa-Vujicic et al.
1993) and n-decyl trimethylammonium bromide (Inácio et al.
2013), have been previously reported to inhibit mitochondrial
oxidative phosphorylation at low concentrations. Although the
recent FDA ruling (FDA 2016) revoked the generally recog-
nized as safe (GRAS) status of CPC in certain products and
requested more evidence supporting GRAS status for BAK
due to concerns about their potential to promote antimicrobial
resistance and other potential safety issues, including possible
hormonal effects (FDA 2016), their usage in numerous other
formulations in health care, food, and pharmaceutical and
cleaning industries are being continued.
Mitochondria are the critical cellular organelles responsible
for energy generation and cellular homeostasis. In the last dec-
ade, mitochondrial dysfunction has emerged as a potential con-
tributing pathologic mechanism for several health problems,
including cardiac diseases (Schwarz et al. 2014), diabetes
(Szendroedi et al. 2011), obesity (Heinonen et al. 2015),
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease (Yan et al. 2013),
and cancer (Rogalinska 2016). Since initial steps of testoster-
one, progesterone, and estrogen biosynthesis take place in the
mitochondrial matrix (Felty and Roy 2005; Ramalho-Santos
and Amaral 2013), a disruption in mitochondrial integrity or
function could possibly lead to endocrine disruption. In addi-
tion, several studies have shown that mitochondrial gene
expression (Chen et al. 2009; Sanchez et al. 2015), structure,
function (Arnold et al. 2012), and morphology (Hara et al.
2014) can be regulated by estrogen, and mitochondrial effects
of estrogen are thought to work through the mitochondrially
localized estrogen receptor b (ERb) (Liao et al. 2015). The
mitochondrial regulation of estrogen signaling at the cellular
level, however, has not been well studied. Several endocrine
disrupting chemicals, such as triclosan (TCS) (Newton et al.
2005; Weatherly et al. 2016), bisphenol A (BPA) (Jiang
et al. 2014; Xia et al. 2014) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-
p-dioxin (TCDD) (Aly and Domènech 2009; Chen et al.
2010; Shertzer et al. 2006), have also been shown to cause
mitochondrial dysfunction. A mechanism through which mi-
tochondrial dysfunction might cause endocrine disruption is
not known.
For the present study, we evaluated the in vitro effects of CPC
as a representative QUATS compound on mitochondrial function
and mitochondrial complex 1, and evaluated its antiestrogenic
activity.

Research
 Materials and Methods
Cell Lines and Cell Culture
The Leber's Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) osteosarcoma
cytoplasmic hybrids (cybrids) were kindly gifted from Drs.
Valerio Carelli and Andrea Martinuzzi, and the retinal ganglion
cell line (RGC-5) was purchased from American Type Culture
Collection. The RGC-5 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) containing 2 mM L-gluta-
mine and 100 mM of sodium pyruvate (DMEM; Corning) and
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Corning). For the osteosarcoma
cells, the DMEM was further supplemented with 50 lg=mL
uridine (Sigma), and antibiotics (50 units=mL) of penicillin=
50 lg=mL of streptomycin (Gibco). The cells were maintained
under 5% carbon dioxide at 37°C.
The human breast carcinoma MCF-7-derived VM7Luc4E2,
ERalpha-positive cells were grown and maintained in alpha
Minimum Essential Medium (Gibco-BRL) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum and maintained at 37°C under 5% CO2 and 85%
humidity.
Chemicals and Chemical Library
The Pharmakon collection containing 1,600 FDA-approved/
clinically evaluated drugs [10 mM dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)]
was purchased from Microsource Discovery Systems Inc. CPC
(Cat# C0732; CAS No. 6,004-24-6) and all other chemicals were
purchased
from
Sigma-Aldrich
unless
otherwise
specified.
The adenosine Triphosphate (ATP) Bioluminescence Assay Kit
CLS II was purchased from Roche Life Science. The ATP-
free Adenosine diphosphate (ADP) was purchased from Cell
Technology. BAK (Cat# B6295; CAS No. 63,449-41-2) stock
solutions were prepared assuming a molecular weight of 375 as
determined by perchloric acid titration by the manufacturer.
Rotenone (Cat# 45,656; CAS No. 83-79-4) and DMSO (Cat#
D8418; CAS No. 67-68-5) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
and used as a positive control and vehicle control, respectively.
Mitochondrial Complex I–Driven ATP Synthesis
Measurement Assay
Mitochondrialcomplex 1-driven ATP synthesisassays(mtCIDAS)
of vehicle- and CPC-treated LHON mutation (11,778) carrying os-
teosarcoma cybrid cells were performed as previously described
with slight modification (Datta et al. 2016). In the previous high-
throughput screen, 2 h of rotenone treatment was done after 22 h of
drug treatment; however, in the current study, the cells were treated
for 24 h with either vehicle or CPC at the specified concentrations
(without any rotenone treatment). Subsequently, the conditioned
media was removed, and the cells were permeabilized with strepto-
lysin O. Permeabilized cells were incubated with a buffer contain-
ing complex I substrates for 30 min, and the mitochondrial ATP
production was measured by using the ATP Bioluminescence
AssayKitCLSIIfollowingmanufacturer’sinstruction.
Oxygen Consumption Assay by BD Biosensor Plates
Oxygen consumption was measured after 2 h of incubation with
the compounds of interest or controls during the high-throughput
screening in RGC-5 cells, as previously described (Sahdeo et al.
2014). Briefly, RGC-5 cells were grown in the media specified
above and were aliquoted (70,000 cells, 90 lL media/well) into
384 well oxygen biosensor plates (BD Biosciences) and allowed
to equilibrate for 20–30 min. The compounds were diluted in
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (100 lM). The compounds
(10 lL) DMSO or [2-([4-(trifluoromethoxy)phenyl] hydrazinyli-
dene)propanedinitrile (FCCP) were added in their respective
wells, and fluorescence was monitored using a POLARstar
Omega Plate Reader (BMG Labtech) set at 37°C. Fluorescence
was monitored at 0 and 2 h postaddition, and plates were incu-
bated at 37°C under 5% CO2 between readings. The final concen-
tration of DMSO was 0.1%, and DMSO and FCCP (5 lM) were
used as negative and positive controls, respectively (Sahdeo et al.
2014). Each compound was evaluated in triplicate (n = 3).
Oxygen Consumption Assay by Clarke Electrode and
Seahorse XF24 Flux Analyzer
Mitochondrial O2 consumption rates of osteosarcoma cybrid cells
carrying healthy (control) or 11,778 LHON mutant mitochondrial
DNA were measured with a Seahorse XF-24 system (Seahorse
Biosciences, currently Agilent Inc.) (Danielson et al. 2002;
Tomilov et al. 2014) and an Oxytherm Clark electrode system
(Hansatech) (Liu et al. 2009). For oxygen consumption assay by
Seahorse XF24 flux analyzer, 50,000 control osteosarcoma
cybrids cells in 200-lL medium/well was plated on 24-well
plates and incubated overnight. Media was changed to unbuffered
DMEM, 20% FBS, 200 mM Glutomax (Thermofisher Scientific
Cat# 35050061), 100 mm sodium pyruvate, 25 mm glucose, and
pH 7.4. Cells were pre-equilibrated for 20 min; oxygen consump-
tion rates (OCR) were recorded with Seahorse XF-24 before and
after addition of CPC.
Cell-Based ER-Mediated Bioassay
Recombinant human breast carcinoma cells (VM7Luc4E2,
ERalpha-positive) were grown and maintained as previously
described (Rogers and Denison 2000). These cells contain a sta-
bly integrated, ER-responsive firefly luciferase reporter plasmid,
pGudLuc7ERE. Cells were maintained in estrogen-stripped
media for 5 d before they were plated into white, clear-bottomed
96-well tissue culture dishes at 75,000 cells/well and allowed to
attach for 24 h. Cells were then incubated with carrier solvent
(DMSO; 1% final solvent concentration), E2 (17b-estradiol,
1 nM), the indicated concentration of compound (for measure-
ment of agonist activity), or the indicated concentration of com-
pound plus 1nM E2 (for measurement of antagonist activity) for
24 h at 37°C with triplicate wells per chemical or control. After
incubation, cells were rinsed twice with PBS, lysed with
Promega cell lysis buffer, and shaken for 20 min at room temper-
ature to allow complete cell lysis. Luciferase activity in each well
was measured using an Orion microplate luminometer as previ-
ously described (Baston and Denison 2011).
Assessment of Cytotoxicity
Cytotoxicity of CPC- and BAK-treated cells were assessed after
24 h of incubation under a brightfield microscope. The cells were
examined for any gross morphological changes (such as rounding
or detachment), and the concentrations of CPC and BAK at
which cells did not show any gross morphological changes were
considered as nontoxic concentrations.
Data Analysis and Statistics
Fluorescence readings representing oxygen consumption were
recorded at 2 h post-chemical library treatment, and lumines-
cence readings for ATP content were collected after 24 h of
chemical treatment. The fold change from baseline (FCB) was
calculated as previously reported (Datta et al. 2016; Sahdeo et al.
2014). Briefly, for oxygen consumption, fluorescence was meas-
ured immediately after drug addition (t0) and after 2 h incubation.
The FCB was calculated by normalizing postincubation readings
to the t0 reading. FCB responses for drug-treated wells were then

 normalized to the average FCB for the 16 vehicle-treated wells
producing the fold change from vehicle value for each well. For
ATP synthesis, cells were drug treated for 22 h and then treated
with rotenone (0:1 lM) for 2 h in 96-well plates. The plate me-
dian was determined and fold change of ATP synthesis rate over
the plate median for each drug-treated well was calculated. The
concentration–response curves were generated, and the half max-
imal inhibitory concentration IC50 values were determined by
nonlinear regression curve fit analysis using Graphpad Prism 5.0
for Windows (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA, www.
graphpad.com).
Results
Evaluation of Mitochondrial Function of Cells Exposed to
Quaternary Ammonium Salts
We previously reported two high-throughput screens of a library
of clinically evaluated additives, disinfectants, and drugs to iden-
tify their effects on two of the mitochondrial functional parame-
ters, i.e., mitochondrial O2 consumption (Sahdeo et al. 2014) and
complex 1-driven ATP synthesis (CIDAS) (Datta et al. 2016).
Mitochondrial O2 consumption was measured using BD biosen-
sor plates in RGC-5 cells after 2 h of compound treatment.
MtCIDAS was measured in permeabilized compound and
rotenone-treated (22 h + 2 h) cybrid cells containing LHON
mutation (11,778) using a bioluminescence method. In order to
identify the compounds that affect both mitochondrial O2 con-
sumption and mtCIDAS, we plotted the results of the O2 con-
sumption screen (Sahdeo et al. 2014) against the mtCIDAS
screen (Datta et al. 2016) (Figure 1). Of the 11 compounds in the
bottom left quadrant (indicative of simultaneous inhibition of mi-
tochondrial O2 consumption and mtCIDAS), 6 were found to be
QUATS, making QUATS the single largest mitochondrial inhibi-
tory structural class. QUATS are lipophilic cations, which is a
structure that has previously been shown to be preferentially
taken up into mitochondria (Murphy and Smith 2007). There
were 10 QUATS compounds common in both the screens, and 6
out of 10 QUATS compounds showed inhibition of mtCIDAS
(24 h) and mitochondrial O2 consumption (2 h) when tested at
10 lM concentration (Figure 1). The QUATS compounds that
did not show mitochondrial inhibition are: clidinium bromide,
hexamethonium bromide, tolonium chloride, and cefalonium. In
the high-throughput screen, CPC was identified as the most
potent of the QUATS tested with regard to mitochondrial O2 con-
sumption and mtCIDAS (Figure 1).
In Vitro Effects of CPC on Mitochondrial O2 Consumption
and Complex 1-Driven ATP Synthesis
Mitochondrial O2 consumption was inhibited after 30 min of
incubation with CPC (IC50: 3:8 lM, Figure 2A). MtCIDAS,
which was measured after 24 h (to allow more complete penetra-
tion of the chemical into mitochondria) also decreased in a
concentration-dependent manner (IC50: 0:9 lM, Figure 2B).
QUATS, such as dequalinium chloride (Gamboa-Vujicic et al.
1993) and n-decyl-N,N,N-trimethylammonium (C10TAB) (Inácio
et al. 2013), are already known to inhibit complex 1 reduced nic-
otinamide adenine dinucleotide [(NADH)-ubiquinone oxidore-
ductase]; hence, we hypothesized that CPC might inhibit
mitochondrial function by targeting complex 1 (NADH-ubiqui-
none oxidoreductase) in the mitochondrial electron transport
chain. The mitochondrial electron carrier ubiquinone carries elec-
trons deposited at mitochondrial complex 2 (succinate dehydro-
genase) to complex 3 (ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase),
independent of complex 1 inhibition (Nicholls and Ferguson
2013). Therefore, addition of a complex 2 substrate (succinate)
subsequent to a complex 1 inhibitor in permeabilized cells should
allow mitochondrial O2 consumption to resume. Hence, rescue of
CPC-induced mitochondrial O2 consumption inhibition by a
complex 2 substrate (succinate) suggests that the target of CPC is
complex 1. CPC (100 lM) was added to digitonin-permeabilized
osteosarcoma cells respiring on complex 1 substrates malate
(5 mM) and pyruvate (5 mM). Within 3 min of CPC addition, the
mitochondrial O2 consumption rate decreased from the baseline
Figure 1. Effects of quaternary ammonium salts on mitochondrial O2 consumption and complex 1-driven adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (CIDAS)
in vitro. We evaluated 1,600 drugs and preservatives from the Pharmakon collection for mitochondrial activity. For CIDAS, 11,778 mutant osteosarcoma
cybrids were treated with the drugs (10 lM) for 22 h followed by 2 h incubation with rotenone (0:03 lM). Subsequently, the cells were permeabilized, and mi-
tochondrial CIDAS (mtCIDAS) was measured. For oxygen consumption assay, the RGC-5 cells were incubated with the compounds for 2 h, and the fluores-
cence was measured. The data are presented as log2ðmedian fold change of ATP synthesis rateÞ vs log2ðmean fold change of O2 consumption in 2 hÞ from three
independent observations. Six quaternary ammonium salts (QUATS) that inhibit mitochondrial O2 consumption and mtCIDAS are highlighted here.

 rate of 11:0 nmol=ml=min to 3:5 nmol=ml=min, an
∼ 70%
decrease (Figure 3). After addition of succinate (5 mM), the mito-
chondrial O2 consumption rate increased to 8:3 nmol=ml=min,
which is consistent with a direct effect of CPC on complex 1 that
inhibited mitochondrial O2 consumption.
In Vitro Effects of CPC and BAK on Estrogenic Signaling
Mitochondria are essential for proper steroidogenesis (Ramalho-
Santos and Amaral 2013). Multiple endocrine disruptors, such as
TCS (Weatherly et al. 2016), BPA (Kaur et al. 2014; Lin et al.
2013), and TCDD (Chen et al. 2010), have shown to adversely
affect mitochondrial function, suggesting a possible correlation
between mitochondrial function and endocrine disruption. We
hypothesized that mitochondrial inhibitors might disrupt endo-
crine signaling, and tested QUATS for antiestrogenic and
proestrogenic effects. At its highest nontoxic concentration
(10 lM), CPC showed 86% inhibition of estrogen activity in
VM7Luc4E2, ERalpha-positive human breast carcinoma cells af-
ter 24 h of incubation (Figure 4A). The concentration–response
curve for antiestrogenic activity overlapped with the concentra-
tion–response curve for mitochondrial O2 consumption inhibition
in osteosarcoma cybrids after 10 min of incubation with CPC
(Figure 4A). The similarity in the dose–response curves for the
two assays suggests that CPC’s antiestrogenic activity might be a
consequence of CPC-mediated inhibition of the mitochondrial
electron transport chain. In previous studies, triclosan was shown
to disrupt mitochondrial function (Weatherly et al. 2016) and in-
hibit estrogen signaling (EC50: 1 lM) (Ahn et al. 2008), similar
to CPC (EC50: 4:5 lM). In addition, we also tested another
QUATS, BAK, for its mitoinhibitory and antiestrogenic effect.
BAK was a comparatively weaker mitochondrial complex 1 in-
hibitor and showed weaker antiestrogenic effects (Figure 4B).
CPC and BAK did not show any estrogen-stimulating effects (up
to 10 lM) in VM7Luc4E2, ERalpha-positive human breast carci-
noma cells after 24 h of incubation (Figure 4C).
Mitochondrial Disruption as Basis of in Vitro
Antiestrogenic Activity: CPC and Rotenone
From the above data, we hypothesized that the antiestrogenic ac-
tivity of the QUATS was dependent on their mitochondrial com-
plex 1 inhibitory activity. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated
rotenone (0:1 lM), a standard mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor
and a known environmental pollutant, for its antiestrogenic activ-
ity. Rotenone (0:1 lM) showed 75% inhibition of estrogen activ-
ity in VM7Luc4E2 human breast carcinoma cells after 24 h, and
reduced mitochondrial oxygen consumption in osteosarcoma
cybrids by 81% after 10 min (Figure 4A). Rotenone does not
interfere with estrogen binding to estrogen receptors (Olson and
Sheehan 1979); therefore, we hypothesize, as we do for CPC and
BAK, that its antiestrogenic effects may be related to mitochon-
drial inhibition. It seems possible that mitochondrial disruption
underlies the inhibition of estrogenic signaling observed in
response to CPC, BAK, and rotenone, but further investigation is
necessary to fully substantiate this potential mechanism.
Discussion and Conclusion
QUATS, such as CPC and BAK, are antimicrobial agents occur
in toothpaste, mouthwash, lozenges, throat and nasal sprays,
Figure 2. Mitochondriotoxic effects of cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC). (A) Inhibition of mitochondrial O2 consumption by CPC. The osteosarcoma cells were
treated with CPC at specified concentrations (0:01–100 lM), and cellular oxygen consumption was measured after 10 min of initial addition and for 4 times
total at 10-min intervals. The data are presented as average percentage of basal oxygen consumption rates ðOCRÞ ± standard deviation from three independent
observations. (B) Inhibition of mitochondrial complex 1-driven adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis (mtCIDAS) by CPC. The osteosarcoma cells were
treated with CPC at specified concentrations (0:1–10 lM) for 22 h followed by 2-h incubation with rotenone (0:03 lM). The mtCIDAS was measured in per-
meabilized cells. Data are presented as average fold change of ATP synthesis rate ± standard deviation from three independent observations. The IC50 values
for mitochondrial O2 consumption and mtCIDAS inhibition are 3:8 lM and 0:9 lM, respectively. The IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression
curve fit analysis using Graphpad Prism 5.0.
Figure 3. The cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC)–dependent respiration defect
was overcome by complex II substrate succinate, but not complex I sub-
strate. Osteosarcoma cybrids were permeabilized with digitonin (4 lM), and
respiration was initiated with complex I substrate (malate/pyruvate, 5 mM).
Then the cells were treated with CPC (100 lM), followed by the complex II
substrate (succinate, 5 mM), a complex III inhibitor, antimycin A (Anti A,
1 lM), and the complex IV substrate ascorbate (Asc, 5 mM) and N,N,N0,
N0-tetramethyl-p-phenylenediamine (TMPD) (0:2 mM) mixture. Oxygen
consumption rates (OCR, nmol/ml/min) of the cybrids were measured for 1
min after each addition. The OCRs after each addition are indicated in the
parentheses from one representative experiment repeated two times. The
CPC-dependent respiration defect was overcome by complex II substrate

 shampoos, hand lotions, creams, eye drops, biocides, intravaginal
sponges, consumer antiseptic rubs, and other products that come
into contact with epithelial cells. In 2016, the FDA ruled that
some ingredients used in consumer antiseptic wash products,
including CPC as well as TCS and other antiseptics, were not
GRAS or generally recognized as effective (GRAE), and that
wash products including these ingredients could not be sold after
September 2017 (FDA 2016). Additional data on BAK are being
requested by the FDA to establish its GRAS/GRAE status.
However, CPC, BAK, and other antiseptics continue to be used
in other products in consumer first-aid, food, personal hygiene
product, and cleaning industries.
We performed a high-throughput screen of 1,600 antiseptics,
additives, and drugs, and found that, of the numerous structural
classes of compounds included in the screen, the QUATS were
the most mitochondrially toxic class, both in terms of inhibition
of ATP synthesis and mitochondrial O2 consumption. QUATS
have the structure of lipophilic cations, which are known to be
preferentially taken up by mitochondria (Murphy and Smith
2007).
Lipophilic
cations,
including
tetramethylrhodamine
methyl ester (Floryk and Houštêk 1999), 1-methyl-4-phenylpyri-
dinium (Davey et al. 1992), and triphenylphosphonium ions
(Ross et al. 2005) are known to dose-dependently accumulate in
the mitochondrial matrix. Six out of ten QUATS showed inhibi-
tion of mitochondrial O2 consumption as well as mtCIDAS. This
indicates a possible structure activity relationship in context to
the mitochondrial effects of QUATS. A detailed comparison
of the antimicrobial efficacy and mitochondrial inhibitory effects
of the QUATS needs to be performed in order to identify the
QUATS with high antimicrobial efficacy with minimum mito-
chondrial effects. Among the mitochondrial inhibitory QUATS,
CPC was the most potent in the preliminary screen and was used
as the representative of the mitochondrial inhibitory QUATS for
further studies. Mechanistic investigation of CPC, the representa-
tive QUATS, established that CPC inhibits mitochondrial com-
plex 1 (Figure 3) and therefore impedes mitochondrial O2
consumption and CIDAS in a concentration-dependent manner.
Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that the QUATS BAK is
also a mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor (Datta et al. 2017).
Although antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics and antisep-
tics, are generally conceived as nontoxic to human mitochondria,
in a recent study, antibiotic-induced functional impairment of
host mitochondria have shown to cause serious adverse effects in
eukaryotic model systems (Moullan et al. 2015). In addition,
induction of mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed as
potential mechanisms for adverse effects observed in clinical set-
tings during therapeutic use of antibiotics (Kalghatgi et al. 2013)
and antiretrovirals (Kohler and Lewis 2007).
We hypothesize that CPC’s antiestrogenic effects may be
mediated through effects on mitochondrial complex 1 inhibition.
Rotenone, an established mitochondrial complex 1 inhibitor
(Heinz et al. 2017), was used as a positive control and also
showed antiestrogenic effects at the single dose tested. However,
additional research is needed to confirm whether effects on
mitochondrial function may contribute to effects on estrogen
signaling.
Although CPC continues to be used in mouthwash, tooth-
paste, lozenges, throat sprays, and nasal sprays, and BAK is used
in intravaginal spermicidal sponges, body and hand washes, and
eyedrops, pharmacokinetic studies on these QUATS are scarce,
and tissue-level exposures resulting from the use of personal care
products that contain these compounds are unknown. A pharma-
cokinetic study performed in rats indicated that BAK is absorbed
after single oral administration and distributed in tissues at low
micromolar concentrations (0:13–26:7 lM) (Xue et al. 2004). In
the same study, aspiration of BAK through the lungs markedly
increased absorption and tissue distribution of BAK (Xue et al.
2004). This is particularly important in the context of BAK and
other QUATS exposure. BAK is often used as a household

nium chloride (BAK)’s antiestrogenic activities with mitochondrial O2
consumption inhibitory activities. The cells (osteosarcoma cybrids for mito-
chondrial O2 consumption experiment and VM7Luc4E2, ERa-positive cells
for estrogenic activity measurement experiments) were treated with (A) CPC
and (B) BAK at specified concentrations for 10 min for the O2 consumption
experiment and 24 h (in the presence of E2) for the antiestrogenic effect. (C)
VM7Luc4E2, ERa-positive cells were treated with CPC or BAK at the
specified concentrations or 17b estradiol (E2, 1 nM) for 24 h, and the estro-
genic activity was measured. Rotenone (Rote), a standard complex 1 inhibi-
tor, was used as a positive control at a single concentration (0:1 lM). The
IC50 values for CPC are 3:8 lM for mitochondrial O2 consumption inhibi-
tion and 4:5 lM for its antiestrogenic activity. The IC50 values for BAK are
13:9 lM for mitochondrial O2 consumption and 17:3 lM for its antiestro-
genic activity. The EC50 value for estrogenic activity of CPC could not be
determined. The solid lines represent the nonlinear regression curve fit for
mitochondrial O2 inhibitory activity, and the dotted lines represent the non-
linear regression curve fit for estrogenic activity of the compounds. The data
are presented as percentage of estrogen activity ± standard deviation and per-
centage of basal oxygen consumption rates ðOCRÞ ± standard deviation from
three independent observations. The IC50 values were determined by nonlin-
ear regression curve fit analysis using Graphpad Prism 5.0.

 disinfectant and biocide in the form of sprays and aerosols. From
the above-mentioned study, it seems that inhalation of aerosols
containing BAK could be a potential route for tissue exposure.
According
to
the
report
by
European
Union’s
Scientific
Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS 2015), predicted aggre-
gate absorption of CPC through various cosmetic formulations,
such as mouth rinse, toothpaste, denture adhesive, denture
cleaner, body lotion, face cream, hand cream, and deodorant
spray, for adult humans is approximately 0:021–0:08 mg=kg
body weight/day, with an estimated/day, with an estimated
absorption of 50% from oral administration and 10% from dermal
administration. Due to the scarcity of pharmacokinetic studies on
long-term or short-term exposure of CPC and BAK by various
routes, exact determination of physiologically relevant tissue con-
centrations of these compounds is not possible at this time.
A recent study demonstrated that exposure to QUATS mix-
ture, including benzalkonium chloride, caused reproductive toxic-
ity and reduced fertility in mice (Melin et al. 2014; Melin et al.
2016). It is our hypothesis that inhibition of mitochondrial func-
tion and subsequent disruption of estrogenic signaling is possibly
the mechanistic basis of the toxicity observed in these studies.
Further mechanistic investigation is needed to conclusively prove
if that is indeed true.
In summary, our findings suggest that the QUATS CPC and
BAK, which are used as disinfectants in consumer products, in-
hibit mitochondrial complex 1 and show antiestrogenic activity
in vitro at low (micromolar) concentrations that may be physio-
logically relevant. We hypothesize a mechanistic relationship
between these outcomes, whereby the antiestrogenic activity of
these compounds is mediated by mitochondrial inhibition. Our
observations that some QUATS do not inhibit mitochondria sug-
gest structure-activity relationship (SAR) to explore antimicrobial
QUATS without antimitochondrial activity. Overall, our findings
strongly support the need for further investigation of the underly-
ing mechanisms and potential consequences of chronic exposure
to CPC and BAK in consumer products.
