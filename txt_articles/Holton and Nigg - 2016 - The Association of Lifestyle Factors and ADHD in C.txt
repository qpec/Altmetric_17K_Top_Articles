Abstract
Objective—The objective of the study is to examine whether children aged 7 to 11 years with 
very well-characterized ADHD, recruited from the community, have a similar number of healthy 
lifestyle behaviors as compared with typically developing children from the same community.
Method—Parents of children with (n = 184) and without (n = 104) ADHD completed a lifestyle 
questionnaire asking about water intake, sweetened beverage consumption, multivitamin/
supplement use, reading, screen time, physical activity, and sleep. A lifestyle index was formed 
from these seven domains (0–7), and multivariable ordered logistic regression was used to 
examine the association of ADHD status and total healthy lifestyle behaviors.
Results—Children with ADHD were almost twice as likely to have fewer healthy behaviors, 
even after adjustment for age, sex, intelligence quotient (IQ), ADHD medication use, household 
income, and four comorbid psychiatric disorders (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval] = 
1.95 [1.16, 3.30], p = .01).
Conclusion—Future research is needed to assess the effects of a combined lifestyle intervention 
in this group.

Introduction
ADHD is increasingly associated with poor health outcomes (Nigg, 2013). The 
characteristics of inattention, impulsivity, and poor planning likely contribute to poor health 
behaviors, but ADHD may also be influenced by these same behaviors (Nigg, 2013; Nigg & 
Holton, 2014). Population survey data have suggested that lifestyle behaviors such as media

 time, physical activity, and sleep disturbance (Lingineni et al., 2012; van Egmond-Frohlich, 
Weghuber, & de Zwaan, 2012) are individually associated with ADHD.
Undesirable lifestyle factors could contribute directly to inattention and/or hyperactivity 
symptoms, could lead to other long-term health issues, and could affect scholastic outcomes. 
Numerous mechanisms exist that could mediate such effects, such as secondary effects on 
energy level, immune function, and epigenetic change. However, first, it is important to 
evaluate the association of ADHD with the overall number of healthy lifestyle factors 
followed. As noted, a handful of national survey studies show an association of ADHD with 
individual lifestyle factors (Lingineni et al., 2012; Sivertsen et al., 2015; Touchette et al., 
2009; van Egmond-Frohlich et al., 2012; Wiles, Northstone, Emmett, & Lewis, 2009), but 
further research is needed to assess the overall number of healthy lifestyle behaviors 
followed, while also addressing the limitations of survey research.
Although these studies have the important advantage of population representation, they have 
not evaluated the potential for combined effects from following multiple healthy lifestyle 
factors. They also have important limitations. In particular, ADHD is not well characterized, 
often assessed only by a single survey question about past diagnoses. There is reason to 
suspect the accuracy of those ADHD assignments. For example, prevalence in some of these 
surveys for ADHD is more than 10%, yet the best scientific evidence for ADHD true 
prevalence is in the 2% to 3% range (Erskine et al., 2013). Furthermore, as parents report on 
both ADHD status and lifestyle, shared source variance may inflate the association of 
ADHD with lifestyle behaviors in those studies. In addition, comorbidity effects are difficult 
to evaluate in those studies, because associated disorders such as depression or oppositional 
defiant disorder also are not able to be thoroughly evaluated. Clinic referrals also have their 
own biases. Thus, well-characterized case control studies of community-recruited samples 
are needed which can address these diagnostic issues and attempt to further evaluate the 
potential association between lifestyle behaviors and ADHD.
The objective of this research was to investigate whether children with carefully 
characterized ADHD have fewer positive healthy lifestyle choices overall, as compared with 
children of a similar age without ADHD, in a well-characterized sample not ascertained by 
clinic referral.
Method
Recruitment and Diagnostic Evaluation
Data are reported for children aged 7 to 11 years classified as having ADHD (n = 184) or as 
typically developing controls (n = 104) from a community-recruited observational cohort. 
Enrollment procedures and details on the multi-informant testing procedures used in this 
cohort have been reported previously (Musser, Galloway-Long, Frick, & Nigg, 2013; 
Musser, Karalunas, Dieckmann, Peris, & Nigg, 2016). Children were recruited from public 
advertisements and direct mass-mailing to all parents in the community with children in the 
target age range. Parents then completed structured diagnostic interviews (Schedule for 
Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children–Epidemiologic Version 
[KSADS-E]; Orvaschel, 1994) with a trained interviewer who was a master’s degree-level

 clinician in social work or psychology. Interviewers were carefully trained with periodic 
quality checks, and their reliability with a master rater was k > 0.70 for all disorders 
evaluated. Parents and teachers each completed normed standardized rating scales: Conners-
III parent and teacher ratings (Conners, Sitarenios, Parker, & Epstein, 1998; Purpura & 
Lonigan, 2009), Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 2001), and ADHD 
Rating Scale (DuPaul, Power, Anastopoulos, & Reid, 1998). Parents also completed an in-
house standardized checklist of health conditions which included comorbid conditions of 
exclusion like psychosis, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, non-correctable vision 
problems, closed head injury, chronic sleep apnea, narcolepsy, and any neurological disorder 
such as epilepsy, autism, schizophrenia, or brain tumor. Past treatments and medications 
were evaluated with a modified Services for Children and Adolescents-Parent Interview 
(SCAPI) (Jensen et al., 2004). Children completed a short IQ screen (a Wechsler Intelligence 
Scale for Children–Fourth Edition [WISC-IV] short form comprising vocabulary, 
information, and block design subtests) and an academic screen (the Wechsler Individual 
Achievement Test, Second Edition [WIAT-II] reading and math subtests; Wechsler, 2005). 
They also completed self-reported ratings of mood using the Children’s Depression 
Inventory (Kovacs, 1985) and the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale (March, Parker, Sullivan, 
Stallings, & Conners, 1997). The clinician interviewed the child, and the psychometrician 
and clinician each made detailed behavioral observations of children. Then a best estimate 
diagnostic procedure was implemented. To do this, a diagnostic team consisting of two 
experienced clinicians, a board certified child psychiatrist, and a licensed clinical child 
psychologist reviewed all available information listed above to arrive at a judgment about 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders diagnosis of ADHD and other 
comorbid psychiatric disorders. They made these judgments independently, with inter-rater 
agreement k > 0.80 for ADHD and k > 0.70 for all disorders with base rate > 5% in the 
sample. Disagreements were resolved by consensus discussion.
Eligibility and Exclusion Criteria
To be eligible for the ADHD group, children had to meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual 
of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) or DSM-5 
(5th ed.; American Psychiatric Association, 2013) criteria for ADHD by consensus of the 
two clinical experts; be free of confounding medical or neurological conditions; free of 
lifetime or current bipolar disorder or psychosis, current substance use disorder, and current 
major depressive episode; and could not be taking long-acting psychoactive medications 
such as anti-depressants. Typically developing comparison children underwent the same 
evaluation and diagnostic procedure, and had the same rule outs, except they also had to 
have no prior diagnosis of ADHD or conduct disorder.
This study was approved by the Oregon Health & Science University Institutional Review 
Board. All parents provided written informed consent, and children provided written 
informed assent.
Lifestyle Behavior Assessment and Creation of Lifestyle Index
A cross-sectional 35-item lifestyle questionnaire was completed by one parent about the 
child to measure lifestyle choices known to affect health as reflected in behaviors over the

 past month. The questionnaire included queries on water intake, sweetened beverage intake, 
supplement use, reading, screen time, physical activity, and sleep.
The lifestyle questionnaire was used to form a lifestyle index constructed to represent 
current health behavior recommendations, as follows. A representative question (or 
questions) for each of the seven lifestyle factors was identified a priori for this purpose 
(below). These were summed to form an index score from 0 to 7. One point was given for 
each positive lifestyle choice, so a high score would indicate a healthy lifestyle. In the case 
of sugar sweetened beverages, three questions were used to encompass consumption of 
either soda, sugar sweetened juice, or energy drinks (like Gatorade). The lifestyle factors 
included in the index were water consumption (0 = <3 cups/day, 1 = ≥3 cups/day), other 
non-juice beverage intake (soda/sweetened juice-like drinks/energy drinks; 1 = ≤1 cup/week, 
0 = >1 cup/week), multivitamin use (1 = yes, 0 = no), reading (0 = ≤1 hr/day, 1 = >1 hr/day), 
screen time (1 = <2 hr/day, 0 = ≥2 hr/day), physical activity (0 = <1 hr/day, 1 = ≥1 hr/day), 
and sleep (0 = <10 hr of sleep/night, 1 = ≥10 hr of sleep/night). These were based on current 
recommendations for children between the ages of 7 and 11 years when available as follows: 
The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends <1 to 2 hr of total screen time/day 
(American Academy of Pediatrics, 2013), ≥1 hr/day of physical activity for children, and 
limiting the consumption of sugar sweetened beverages (Daniels, Hassink, & Committee on 
Nutrition, 2015). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2008) also 
recommends that children get ≥1 hr of physical activity/day. The National Sleep Foundation 
recommends that children aged 6 to 13 years get between 9 and 11 hr of sleep per night 
(Hirshkowitz et al., 2015); we used the average of 10 hr as the cutoff for adequate sleep. The 
U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends that boys and girls consume 
approximately 1.7 L (7 cups)/day of water from 4 to 8 years old, and 2.1 to 2.4 L (8–10 
cups)/day for girls and boys (respectively) from 9 to 13 years old (Medicine, 2005). Water is 
consumed not only directly but also indirectly in other beverages such as milk and juice. For 
this study, we examined whether parents reported that their children drank ≥3 cups of water/
day, assuming that children were likely to be getting water from other sources as well. This 
cutoff of three cups/day can be used to assess the willingness of a child to drink water as 
opposed to other beverages.
The exceptions here were as follows. No consensus or authoritative recommendations have 
been given on an exact cutoff for non-juice sweetened beverage intake. We chose to use one 
cup/week as a cutoff using this as infrequent consumption as a “treat” rather than daily 
consumption where intake was more likely to affect health. Similarly, no recommendations 
exist for multivitamin use by children; however, since multivitamin use could compensate 
for poor dietary intake in children, we decided to include this in the measure.
Data Reduction and Data Analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted using SAS® 9.4. Simple descriptive data for individual 
variables from the lifestyle questionnaire are provided for descriptive purposes. Categorical 
variables were compared by ADHD status (no/yes) using the chi-square statistic, or Fisher’s 
exact test where appropriate. Continuous variables were compared according to ADHD 
status using student t tests, and non-normally distributed variables were analyzed with the

 non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Spearman rank correlation coefficients were 
computed to assess the correlation between teacher and parental raw scores and the lifestyle 
index, and Pearson correlation coefficients were estimated for the individual components of 
the lifestyle index. Multivariable ordered logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of 
having a lower Lifestyle Index score while controlling for covariates (ordered logistic 
regression estimates probabilities cumulated over the lower ordered values). Potential 
confounders (covariates) included sex, age, IQ, stimulant use (note that other psychoactive 
medications were exclusionary), comorbid psychiatric conditions (composite of all anxiety 
disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder, and mood disorders), and total 
household income of the child’s primary residence (as a proxy for socioeconomic status 
[SES]). Secondary analyses examined the association of the lifestyle index variable with the 
inattention and hyperactivity symptom domains, by substituting individual parental and 
teacher raw scores from the Conners-III, for the ADHD variable.
Results
Table 1 provides clinical and demographic description of the groups, which reflects the 
expected features of our community-based recruitment strategy. Groups were of similar age, 
race, and ethnicity. Consistent with community prevalence rates, children with ADHD, as 
compared with controls, were more likely to be male and to have oppositional defiant or 
anxiety disorders. The ADHD group had a lower estimated IQ than the typically developing 
controls, although both groups had above average IQ. With regard to the DSM-IV subtypes 
and DSM-5 presentations, most youth with ADHD met criteria for a combined presentation 
(71%), followed by inattentive (25%) and hyperactive-impulsive (4%) presentations.
Multivariable ordered logistic regression results shown in Table 2 demonstrate that children 
with ADHD were almost twice as likely to have a low lifestyle index score compared with 
those without ADHD. These results remained robust even after adjustment for age, sex, IQ, 
ADHD medication, and various comorbid disorders. When further including adjustment for 
all four comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (mood disorder, anxiety disorder, oppositional 
defiant disorder, and conduct disorder), the multivariable adjusted odds ratio (OR) (95% 
confidence interval [CI]) was 1.95 [1.16, 3.29]; p < .01, and additional adjustment for total 
household income (as a measure of SES) did not materially change these estimates, with a 
multivariable adjusted OR [95% CI] that was practically unchanged at 1.95 [1.16, 3.30]; p 
< .01. Thus, these covariates did not account for the observation that children with ADHD 
were about twice as likely as comparison youth to have unhealthy lifestyle behavior scores.
A secondary analysis was performed to assess whether these lifestyle characteristics were 
more strongly correlated with inattention or with hyperactivity symptom domains. Both 
teacher and parental domain scores (obtained from their ADHD rating scale) were 
negatively correlated with the Lifestyle Index. For inattention, the correlation for teachers 
was ρ = –.21 (p < .001), and for parents, it was ρ = –.15 (p = .008). For hyperactivity-
impulsivity, the teacher effect was ρ = –.16 (p = .01) and the parent effect was ρ = –.12 (p 
= .04). This suggests that the association was similar for the two domains within reporter. In 
the multivariable regression analysis predicting the dichotomous lifestyle index, the teacher 
sub-scores remained robustly related to the lifestyle index. For every 1 point increase on the

 teacher inattention or hyperactivity score, the odds of having less healthy lifestyle behaviors 
increased by 4%, OR [95% CI] = 1.04 [1.01, 1.07], p = .01 for inattention, and 1.04 [1.01, 
1.08], p = .02 for hyper-activity. Thus, associations were not explainable by shared source 
variance (parent rating on both lifestyle and symptoms), because teacher ratings of 
symptoms were also similarly associated with parent-rated child lifestyle behaviors.
For completeness, and to generate exploratory hypotheses for further study, Table 3 provides 
responses to the entire questionnaire, although because those individual findings are 
susceptible to family-wise Type I error, our conclusions emphasize the lifestyle index. This 
table shows uncorrected univariate associations of ADHD with specific lifestyle behaviors. 
Children with ADHD were more likely to consume artificially sweetened juice, were more 
likely to be taking a multivitamin or an omega-3 fatty acid supplement, less likely to report 
reading for >1 hr/day, more likely to report ≥2 hr of screen time per day, and to report fewer 
hours of physical activity during the week, than controls. Parents of children with ADHD 
more often thought caffeine had some effect on their child than parents of normally 
developing children, yet were almost evenly split on whether caffeine “improved” or 
“worsened” their child’s behavior. Parents of children with ADHD, as compared with 
parents of controls, were much more likely to report that their children have difficulty falling 
asleep (45% vs. 9%, respectively, p < .0001), to report concern about their child’s sleep 
habits, and to fear that sleep problems may be leading to behavior issues. Sleep problems 
were related to ADHD even when restricting the analysis to only those not currently taking 
stimulant medication (where 33% of parents of ADHD children vs. 9% of parents of 
controls reported children having trouble falling asleep, p < .0001).
Finally, correlations for the components of the lifestyle index were analyzed to evaluate 
whether some healthy behaviors may help influence other healthy behaviors. Adequate 
water intake correlated with infrequent consumption of other sweetened beverages, reading 
>1 hr/day was correlated with meeting the screen time recommendations, and meeting the 
screen time recommendations also correlated with infrequent consumption of sweetened 
beverages. Other health behaviors were slightly correlated with meeting the sleep 
recommendation, at p < .10, including infrequent consumption of sweetened beverages and 
getting ≥1 hr/day of physical activity.
Discussion
Prior literature has examined individual lifestyle factors with ADHD, but the overall number 
of healthy lifestyle behaviors engaged in by children with ADHD has not been addressed. 
Furthermore, those survey data require confirmation in samples with carefully characterized 
ADHD and control of comorbid disorders. Survey studies in particular, such as data from the 
National Survey of Children’s Health (NSCH; Lingineni et al., 2012), confirm that some of 
these individual effects are likely generalizable at a population level. However, healthy 
behaviors need to be looked at in aggregate as overall healthy lifestyle may be much more 
impactful than the contribution of only one or two health behaviors individually; and 
confirmation in studies that can use a more rigorous characterization of ADHD is necessary. 
The present study adds to this literature in two ways: (a) by examining the overall number of 
key lifestyle behaviors followed by children with ADHD as compared with controls, while

 (b) using children with very well-characterized ADHD and comorbid disorders, recruited 
from the community. Using a composite lifestyle index, we confirmed a robust association 
of ADHD with a less healthy lifestyle, as defined by the children following fewer healthy 
lifestyle behaviors than control children of the same age. These results held even after 
adjustment for multiple confounding factors, including age, sex, IQ, ADHD medication, 
comorbid psychiatric conditions, and household income (as a measure of SES). 
Confirmation using teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms provides assurance that effects are 
not attributable to shared source variance. Thus, these results underscore the importance of 
considering unhealthy lifestyle behaviors as a feature of ADHD that may be an important 
target for preventive or secondary intervention.
Specific aspects of this index are worthy of some elaboration. First, water consumption is a 
simple, yet often overlooked, aspect of children’s health. Children with ADHD were 
marginally less likely to consume ≥3 cups/day of water than controls (28% vs. 38%, p = .
06). It is important to note that both groups had very low water consumption in this study, so 
all children may benefit from counseling on increased water consumption.
Another aspect of beverage consumption which differed between groups in this study was 
consumption of artificially sweetened juice drinks. Children with ADHD consumed greater 
amounts of artificially sweetened juice than controls. The higher consumption of artificially 
sweetened drinks could potentially contribute to ADHD symptoms; however, it could also be 
due to parents believing that lowering sugar consumption may result in reduced ADHD 
symptoms. There have been reports of ADHD-like symptoms following the consumption of 
artificial sweeteners like aspartame (Bradstock et al., 1986), though other industry-funded 
studies failed to show a similar association (Shaywitz et al., 1994; Wolraich et al., 1994). 
More research is needed to determine whether there are effects of artificial sweeteners on 
ADHD.
On the contrary, parents of children with ADHD were more likely to report giving their child 
a multivitamin or a fish oil supplement. This may be related to media reports about 
micronutrient (Bener, Kamal, Bener, & Bhugra, 2014; Rucklidge & Kaplan, 2014) and fatty 
acid (Bloch & Qawasmi, 2011; Gow, Hibbeln, & Parletta, 2015; Hawkey & Nigg, 2014) 
deficiencies in children with ADHD, or due to increased access to health care providers who 
may make this recommendation. This reflects a positive lifestyle change as many children 
with ADHD may not be getting adequate nutrition (Howard et al., 2011).
Although not commonly thought of as a health behavior, reading can offset screen time, 
improve academic success, and, in turn, improve health literacy (Hersh, Salzman, & 
Snyderman, 2015); thus, we decided to include this measure in our index. We observed that 
children with ADHD were less likely to read for >1 hr/day than control children. It is 
common for children with ADHD to struggle with reading and spelling (Czamara et al., 
2013), which suggests that more time spent on reading in the home on a daily basis may be 
beneficial for learning. Furthermore, reading at bedtime can replace screen time activities 
and help with good sleep hygiene rituals.

 We also observed that 48% of children with ADHD, as compared with 35% of control 
children, reported ≥2 hr of screen time on an average school day, p = .02. The rapidly 
growing use of screens by children of all ages, from TV and gaming in older children, to use 
of iPads by infants <1 year of age, is of increasing concern. A recent meta-analysis confirms 
a small but reliable association of screen time with increased symptoms of ADHD, which 
appears, based on a small number of experimental and prospective studies, to have a causal 
component (Nikkelen, Valkenburg, Huizinga, & Bushman, 2014). Furthermore, a child 
having a TV in his or her bedroom has been associated with increased overall screen time by 
approximately 32% (Lo, Waring, Pagoto, & Lemon, 2015), and the presence of a television 
in the bedroom has been associated with increased sleep problems as well (Mistry, 
Minkovitz, Strobino, & Borzekowski, 2007). Current guidelines from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics recommend <1 hr to 2 hr of total screen time/day and removal of 
TVs from the bedroom (American Academy of Pediatrics, 2013), although new guidelines 
are expected in late 2016. It is important to note a limitation of the screen time data from this 
survey. Because parents do not directly observe all screen time that may occur during the 
day, some screen time such as that occurring on handheld devices during school hours and 
screen time on computers at school are probably not being reflected in screen time estimates. 
However, as this limitation applies to both ADHD children and controls, it is unlikely to 
have biased the results presented here.
Television use and screen time also seem to co-occur with reduced physical activity. For 
example, data from the NSCH demonstrated that nationally, children and adolescents aged 5 
to 17 years with ADHD were 32% more likely to watch TV ≥1 hr/day (OR [95% CI] = 1.32 
[1.03, 1.70]), and were 20% less likely to participate in sports (OR [95% CI] = 0.80 [0.65, 
0.98]), than children or adolescents without ADHD (Lingineni et al., 2012). German 
researchers have also shown that ADHD symptoms were positively associated with TV 
viewing; however, conversely, they reported a positive association with total physical activity 
(van Egmond-Frohlich et al., 2012). Our data support the prior findings from the NSCH 
study, with increased screen time (p = .02) and decreased sports participation (p = .003) 
reported by parents of children with ADHD as compared with typically developing children.
Physical activity in itself is important for attention, mood, and ADHD symptoms, as shown 
by a rapidly growing literature (Archer & Kostrzewa, 2012; Cerrillo-Urbina et al., 2015; 
Gapin & Etnier, 2010; Ziereis & Jansen, 2015). For reviews, see the following (Halperin, 
Berwid, & O’Neill, 2014; Neudecker, Mewes, Reimers, & Woll, 2015). Exercise appears to 
be particularly important for the normal development of executive function (Guiney & 
Machado, 2013; Hillman, 2014), a key driver of symptoms of inattention and 
disorganization in ADHD. The reverse could also be true. For example, children with 
ADHD may avoid sports participation due to negative social interactions in the team 
environment (Lee, Causgrove Dunn, & Holt, 2014), although physical activity benefits could 
be attained through individual sports or active play as well. Current recommendations from 
the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (2008) are for school-age children to get 
≥1 hr of physical activity per day. There is scholarly interest in whether this activity should 
include complex motor learning to maximize benefits for neural and executive development 
(Myer et al., 2015), whether it should be of moderate–high intensity to benefit ADHD-
related symptoms (Gapin & Etnier, 2010), and whether it needs to include complex motor

 movements to be beneficial (Myer et al., 2015). These are all important questions which 
need to be addressed in future research.
We observed a strong association between ADHD and poor sleep in this study, which was 
not attributed solely to stimulant medication use. This finding supports previous research 
which has been summarized in multiple review studies looking at the association of ADHD 
with impaired sleep (Corkum, Tannock, & Moldofsky, 1998; Spruyt & Gozal, 2011). Again, 
effects could well be bidirectional. Poor sleep has been associated with psychological and 
cognitive impairments (Brand & Kirov, 2011) including inattention. At the same time, 
children with ADHD are well known to have difficulty with sleep-related and bedtime 
behaviors. Our findings confirm prior reports that sleep, as a critical healthy lifestyle 
behavior, is not being met adequately in these children.
As lifestyle choices like screen time right before bed, caffeine intake, and physical activity 
can all affect sleep, these factors should be considered, in addition to stimulant medication 
use, when assessing contributors to sleep problems in ADHD. Benefits of improved sleep 
hygiene were noted in a recent study where pediatricians taught parents (through handouts) 
about sleep hygiene issues like using a set bedtime, maintaining bedtime routines, removal 
of all media from the bedroom, and avoiding caffeine consumption. Results from this study 
showed improvements in ADHD symptoms, sleep, and health-related quality of life 
(Hiscock et al., 2015). The current recommendation for children aged 6 to 13 years is to aim 
for 9 to 11 hr of sleep/night (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015).
It is important to note that the lifestyle factors examined in this article are inter-related, in 
that healthy behaviors may influence one another; and children with one unhealthy behavior 
may have unhealthy behaviors in other areas as well. For example, physical activity 
increases thirst (making water intake more attractive), can offset screen time, and improves 
sleep. Similarly, removal of caffeinated beverages prevents their diuretic effect, can help 
increase water intake (as an alternative beverage), and can prevent sleep disturbance. 
Reading can replace screen time and can help sleep hygiene rituals. Correlations of the 
components of the lifestyle index support this idea. Any clinical program certainly will need 
to look at the integrated healthy behavior picture. For this reason, the present study 
considered a global composite of healthy behaviors. However, at a practical level, as 
clinicians are well aware, too many recommendations can overwhelm parents. Thus, it is 
necessary to balance the idea of one step at a time changes (which may have positive 
cascade effects) versus the cases where it is easier to put a new overall schedule of activity in 
place with multiple changes at once (like improving sleep hygiene with a combined 
approach).
A key contribution of this study is that it expands on current survey data by reporting on the 
overall number of healthy lifestyle behaviors using a sample in which ADHD diagnosis, as 
well as comorbid conditions, were independently confirmed and jointly analyzed in a 
community-recruited sample. Survey data are typically limited by reliance on parental report 
of all variables. Here, we used parent and teacher report to establish ADHD diagnosis, and 
confirmed that a lower lifestyle index score was associated with teacher-rated inattention and 
hyperactivity. Thus, effects are not attributable to reporting bias from parents. Finally, to our

 knowledge, this is the first study to examine whether the overall number of healthy lifestyle 
behaviors differs between children with ADHD and typically developing control children.
This research is limited by the fact that it is a cross-sectional survey. Surveys do not allow 
for in-depth assessment of each lifestyle behavior such as directly monitoring physical 
activity. Similarly, we cannot assess causality with a cross-sectional design, and bidirectional 
effects are quite likely in many instances. It is possible that ADHD leads to less healthy 
behaviors, due perhaps to impulsivity, inattention, dysphoric mood, family disorganization, 
or other factors. It is also possible that poor health behaviors contribute to, or exacerbate, 
ADHD. As it becomes more clear that the association of ADHD with lifestyle behaviors is 
robust, the importance of evaluating potential benefits of lifestyle intervention on ADHD 
continues to grow. At the same time, ample evidence indicates that there is reason to hope 
that lifestyle changes may help children with ADHD to improve. However, a further concern 
is preventing negative secondary health problems in children with ADHD, regardless of 
effects on attention per se.
Conclusion
Children with ADHD are less likely to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors than non-
ADHD youth. Although causal effects are not fully known, children with ADHD may 
benefit from improved lifestyle choices. Healthy behavior change could be an important 
target of conversation between clinicians and parents during appointments, and future 
research is warranted to examine the effects of a combined lifestyle intervention, using 
detailed and accurate assessments of each lifestyle behavior, on children with ADHD.
