 INTRODUCTION
T
he oral cavity is not only the site of the first stage in digestion but also the
brain's source of much sensory information about food, such as taste,
smell, and texture. It is known that changing this sensory information alters
the process of digestion and the sense of satiation (Fujise et al., 1993).
During feeding, several physical responses are activated, including non-
shivering heat production, called post-prandial thermogenesis. Post-prandial
thermogenesis is reduced in both humans and dogs when oral sensations are
eliminated by gastric-tube feeding (Diamond et al., 1985; LeBlanc and Brondel,
1985). Long-term tube feeding causes a large increase in body weight and
percentage of body fat in both rats and humans (LeBlanc and Brondel, 1985;
LeBlanc and Diamond, 1986; Yamashita et al., 1993). These results suggest that
taste may regulate not only satiety but also energy metabolism by producing
thermogenesis during feeding. However, taste is not the only oral sensation;
there is also proprioception from masseter muscle spindles and exteroception
from the periodontal ligaments during mastication. The present study aimed to
determine whether the amount of masticatory effort plays a role in regulating
metabolic energy by comparing body weight gain, adiposity, and thermogenic
response during feeding in growing rats fed either a hard or a soft diet.
MATERIALS & METHODS
General Procedure
Animals
Mature male Wistar King A rats were used after being weaned at 4 wks. They
were housed in a soundproof room under controlled environmental conditions (21
+ 1°C, 55 + 5% humidity) and with a 12:12-hour light-dark cycle (light on at
0800 hrs). All studies were conducted in accordance with the Kyushu University
Guidelines based on the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.
Foods
The rats were allowed free access to either standard control pellets or soft pellets.
Both kinds of pellets (Oriental #MF Tokyo, Japan) had the same nutritional
components, were of the same size and shape, and had the same water content.
We gave the soft pellets a lower density (3.5 g for hard pellets, 2.5 g for soft
pellets) by increasing their air content. The average yield forces of control and
soft pellets were calibrated at the factory to 85.5 N and 41.8 N, respectively.
Experimental Procedure
Measurement of Body Weight, Food Intake, and Body Composition
Twenty rats were divided into 2 weight-matched groups (n = 10) at weaning (4
wks) and were fed either the control or the soft diet until they reached 26 wks of
age. The rats were allowed free access to the pellets and tap water. Body weight
was measured weekly, and 24-hour food intake was measured every 2 wks, starting
when the rats were 8 wks old. One week before the end of the experimental period,
each rat was housed individually in a cage. Body weight and 24-hour food intake
were measured daily for each rat throughout the following 7 days. All rats were
ABSTRACT
Dietary factors such as taste and nutrients are
known to affect satiety and energy balance. We
hypothesized that food texture might contribute to
the regulation of energy metabolism through the
process of mastication in the oral cavity as well.
The effects of long-term feeding of different-
textured pellets on body weight gain, adiposity,
and thermogenesis were assessed. From weaning
at 4 wks, rats were divided into 2 groups fed on
either standard (controls) or soft pellets (soft-fed)
that required less chewing with the same
nutritional composition. At 26 wks, the soft-fed
rats showed greater adiposity than did the controls.
Daily food intake did not differ between the 2
groups. The increase in body temperature
following feeding was significantly lower in the
soft-fed rats. These results suggested that food
texture affected energy metabolism by changing
post-prandial thermogenesis. The long-term
deficiency of thermogenesis associated with soft
foods resulted in a greater tendency toward
obesity.
KEY WORDS: mastication, soft diets, body fat,

killed, and trunk blood was collected for glucose, insulin, free fatty
acid (FFA), triglyceride (TG), and leptin determinations; the white
adipose tissue (WAT) deposits (abdominal white adipose tissue:
perirenal, epididymal, and mesenteric) were dissected and weighed.
Measurement of Daily Core Body Temperature
Matched by body weight, another 10 rats were divided equally into
2 groups after being weaned at 4 wks and fed either the control or
the soft diet ad libitum. The body weight was significantly different
between the 2 groups after 17 wks. At 22 wks, after the soft-fed rats
had attained a statistically greater body weight, each rat received an
intraperitoneally placed biotelemetry transmitter under
intraperitoneal pentobarbital sodium anesthesia. After a recovery
period of 1 wk, each rat's body temperature and locomotor activity
were recorded at a rate of 1 sample per min for 3 days, while free
access to food and water was allowed in the cages.
Measurement of Post-prandial Thermogenesis
At the end of body-temperature measurement for 3 days, the rats
were made to fast for 24 hrs. At 10:00 hrs the next morning, the
rats were given their usual soft or control diet, and their body
temperatures were recorded at one-minute intervals. All rats started
to eat immediately when food was presented. During the first hour
after they began eating, we measured feeding duration, food
volume, and locomotor activity.
Serum Metabolites
Serum samples from experiment 1 were stored at -20°C until the
time of measurement. Serum leptin, glucose, insulin, FFA, and TG
levels were measured with the use of commercially available kits
(Glucose, Merckauto Glucose, Kanto Chemical Co., Tokyo, Japan;
Insulin, Rat insulin [125I] assay system, Amersham, Buckingham-
shire, England; FFA, NEFA-SS 'Eiken', Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd.,

Measurements of 
Core Body Temperature 
and Locomotor Activity
Core temperature was measured
with a biotelemetry transmitter
implanted into the peritoneal cavity.
A battery-operated biotelemetry
device designed to measure body
temperature and locomotor activity
(Model TA11CTA-F40, Data
Sciences International, St. Paul, MN,
USA) was implanted into the
peritoneal cavity of each rat (Ruf
and Heldmaier, 1987). Output was
monitored by a mounted antenna
placed under each animal's cage
(Model RPC-1, Data Sciences
International). The monitor was
connected to a computer (Series
3510V5, Compaq Computer Corp.,
Houston, TX, USA; IBM-compat-
ible). A Dataquest 4 data acquisition
system (Data Sciences International)
was used for automatic control of
data collection and analysis. Body temperature and locomotor activity
were monitored and recorded at one-minute intervals.
Statistical Analysis
All data were expressed as means + SEM (standard error of the
mean), and ANOVA for repeated measures was used initially for
comparison of inter-group differences in body weights and body
temperature. When significant inter-group differences were found,
post hoc Bonferroni corrections were carried out at each time
point. Differences in WAT weight and serum contents were tested
for significance by the Mann-Whitney-U test (p < 0.05).
RESULTS
Changes in body weight as the rats grew from 4 to 26 wks are
shown in Fig. 1A. Initially, growth was rapid until 9 wks, then
the gain in body mass slowed. Initially, body weight of the
soft-fed rats did not differ from that of controls. However, after
22 wks, body weight in the soft-fed group was significantly
greater. The 24-hour food intake at each week did not differ
between the groups (Fig. 1B).
At 26 wks, the body weight and the absolute weight of
dissected abdominal WAT were significantly greater in soft-fed
rats compared with those in controls. The percent WAT,
expressed as tissue weight per unit of body weight, was also
statistically greater than that of control rats (Table). The
concentrations of serum glucose, insulin, FFA, and TG also
showed no significant difference between soft-fed and control
rats at 26 wks. Only the serum leptin concentration of the soft-
fed rats was significantly higher than that of controls (Table).
Fig. 2 shows changes in core body temperature of soft- and
control-fed rats at 26 wks. The temperatures shown are the
average of 3 experimental days. Body temperature showed

normal daily fluctuations, from a low during the light period to a
high during the dark period. There was no significant difference
in body temperature during the light period between the groups.
However, during the dark period, body temperature in the soft-fed
rats was significantly lower compared with that in controls at
22:00, 23:00, 02:00, 03:00, and 05:00 hrs. There was no
significant difference in the amount of locomotor activity between
the groups during light and dark periods (data not shown).
Fig. 3A shows the changes in body temperature in response to
feeding of soft or control pellets. Body temperature immediately
increased in both groups after the start of a meal. To demonstrate
this thermogenesis clearly, we expressed changes in body
temperature as a percentage of the baseline temperature at the
start of the meal (Fig. 3B). The peak body temperature was about
5.2% (1.8°C) in the control rats during the hour after the start of
the meal, but only about 4.6% (1.4°C) in soft-fed rats. Body
temperature in the soft-fed rats was significantly lower compared
with that in controls at 47, 48, 49,
55, and 57 min after the start of
the meal. During the hour after
the meal began, food intake, meal
duration, and locomotor activity
did not differ significantly
between the groups (amounts of
food intake, control 9.2 + 0.2 g
vs. soft 8.2 + 2.9 g; meal
duration, control 38 min 3 sec + 4
min 5 sec vs. soft 34 min 2 sec ±
3 min; counts of locomotor
activities, control 216.5 + 56.6
vs. soft 181.3 + 32.1).
DISCUSSION
In the present study, we used
the abdominal WAT weights
and the serum leptin levels as
measures of adiposity. Based on
these measurements, the rats fed
soft pellets became obese
within 22 wks compared with
control-fed rats. Leptin, the
product of the ob gene, is an
adipose-tissue-secreted protein that signals to the brain the
magnitude of energy stored and thereby regulates food intake
and energy balance (Zhang et al., 1994; Tartaglia et al., 1995).
A high serum leptin level is known to be correlated with
adipose tissue mass and Body Mass Index increment (Maffei et

Oka et al.
J Dent Res 82(6) 2003
al., 1995). We believe that the increased body weight in the
soft-fed rats was the result of increased fat deposition.
Fat deposition results from an imbalance between energy
intake and energy expenditure. Food intake at each age was not
significantly different between the groups, suggesting that the
total energy intake was the same in both groups. We suspect that
the body-weight gain of soft-fed rats results from decreasing
energy expenditures that might be reflected in a difference of
body temperature or locomotor activity between the groups.
Although the 2 groups' changes in body temperature during
the light period did not differ, the body temperature of the soft-fed
rats during the dark period was significantly lower than that of the
controls. While behavioral factors such as feeding, drinking, and
locomotor activity might be related to less thermogenesis in the
dark period, we found that both groups had the same amounts of
food and water intake and the same amounts of locomotor
activity. Therefore, these behavioral factors cannot explain the
lower thermogenic response of the soft-fed rats during the dark
period. Instead, the observed differences in body temperature
appear to be a response to the actual act of feeding. Body
temperature immediately increased in both groups after the start
of a meal, but this elevation was attenuated in the soft-fed rats.
Several reports have suggested that taste and smell were the
factors controlling post-prandial thermogenesis at the initiation
of feeding, and this early thermogenesis has been shown to be
independent of the meal size and amount of calorie intake
(LeBlanc and Brondel, 1985; LeBlanc and Diamond, 1986;
Saito et al., 1989). This was also the case here; the different
amounts of post-prandial thermogenesis between the groups
occurred within an hour after feeding started, although the food
intake and locomotor activity of both groups were similar. Our
results suggest that food texture is also an important factor
regulating thermogenesis at feeding.
Exactly how the different food textures affected peripheral
thermogenesis remains unclear. Food texture does modulate
hypothalamic neurotransmitter activities (Fujise et al., 1993;
Yang et al., 1997). Proprioceptive and exteroceptive signals from
the oral cavity are conveyed to the mesencephalic trigeminal
nucleus (Me5) through the trigeminal sensory nerves. We
previously reported that turnover of neuronal histamine in the
Me5 is elevated during the early phase of feeding and is elevated
in the hypothalamus at the later phase. This elevated turnover is
abolished by gastric intubation for an isocaloric liquid diet or by
an equal volume of water (Fujise et al., 1998). Energy
metabolism, including thermogenesis, is regulated through
sympathetic activity in the hypothalamus (Perkins et al., 1981;
Rothwell and Stock, 1979). The histamine system in the
hypothalamus controls body temperatures (Sakata et al., 1997;
Yoshimatsu et al., 1999; Masaki et al., 2001); therefore, it is
possible that the low masticatory effort with soft foods might
reduce post-prandial thermogenesis by down-regulating
hypothalamic histaminergic neurons.
In the present study, the thermogenesis of soft-fed rats was
lower than that of control-fed rats in the dark period, probably
resulting in reduced energy expenditure in the soft-fed rats. For
fat deposition to be induced, any imbalance between energy
intake and expenditure must last a long time. In this study, 22
wks was long enough to produce obesity in soft-fed rats.
In summary, we demonstrated that long-term feeding of
soft pellets induced an increase in body weight and fat
deposition, due to lowered post-prandial thermogenesis. Food
texture might be as important a factor for preventing obesity as
taste or food nutrients.
