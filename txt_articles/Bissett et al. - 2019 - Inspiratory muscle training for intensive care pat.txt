Objectives: To describe a multidisciplinary approach to inspiratory muscle training (IMT) for patients in
the intensive care unit (ICU).
Background: Inspiratory muscle weakness is a known consequence of prolonged mechanical ventilation,
and there is emerging evidence that specific IMT can ameliorate this weakness. However, IMT is not yet
standard practice in many ICUs, possibly because of the wide variety of methods reported and a lack of
published practical guidelines. While the optimal parameters for IMT are yet to be established, we share
our detailed methodology which has been shown to be safe in selected ventilator-dependent
patients and is the only approach which has been shown to increase quality of life in ICU patients.
Methods: Patients who have experienced invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 7 days can
commence IMT in either the ventilator-dependent phase or when weaned from mechanical ventilation.
Intensity should be prescribed based on maximum inspiratory pressure, which is measurable through
the tracheostomy or endotracheal tube via the ventilator or a respiratory pressure meter. Using a
removable threshold device, we recommend high-intensity training (5 sets of 6 breaths at a minimum of
50% of maximum inspiratory pressure) performed once per day, supervised by the physiotherapist, with
intensity increased daily such that patients can only just complete the 6th breath in each set.
Results: Using this high-intensity approach, IMT is likely to improve not only inspiratory muscle
strength but also quality of life in patients recently weaned from mechanical ventilation of 7 days'
duration or longer. Effective IMT requires a multidisciplinary approach to maximise feasibility, with
doctors, nurses, and therapists working closely to optimise conditions for successful IMT.
Conclusions: This multidisciplinary approach to implement IMT in ICU patients should assist clinicians in
translating best-available evidence into practice, with the potential to enhance patient recovery.

 and endurance.1e5 Diaphragmatic atrophy occurs rapidly and is
detectable in patients after just 18e69 h of controlled MV.6 In pa-
tients mechanically ventilated for more than 24 h, diaphragmatic
dysfunction is associated with difficult and prolonged weaning.3,5
In a study of 124 patients ventilated for more than 24 h, 54% had
detectable inspiratory muscle weakness before ventilatory wean-
ing, and inspiratory muscle weakness was independently associ-
ated with 1-year mortality.7 Diaphragmatic atrophy tends to be
worse in patients ventilated with controlled modes compared to
spontaneous modes and appears to be related to a patient's inspi-
ratory effort whilst ventilator-dependent.8 While many Australian
ICUs preferentially use more spontaneous modes of ventilation (i.e.
pressure support), impaired inspiratory muscle strength remains a
persistent problem in a third of patients largely ventilated through
spontaneous modes.1 Furthermore, inspiratory muscle weakness is
likely to contribute to the elevated dyspnoea observed in one-third
of patients recently weaned from prolonged MV.1 Thus inspiratory
muscle impairment may negatively affect recovery for many ICU
patients.
Over the past 15 years, inspiratory muscle training (IMT) (i.e.
specific strengthening of the inspiratory muscles) has emerged as a
promising treatment for ICU patients. A recent systematic review9
of 28 studies (n ¼ 1184) revealed that IMT improves inspiratory
muscle strength in ICU patients and is associated with acceleration
of ventilatory weaning. Furthermore, in patients who have failed to
wean from MV, IMT may enhance weaning success.10 Improve-
ments in inspiratory muscle strength, as a result of IMT, have also
been associated with improvements in quality of life following just
2 weeks of training in patients recently weaned from MV.11 Given
the reversibility of inspiratory muscle weakness and the potential
benefits to patients' quality of life, ICU clinicians are now seeking to
translate this evidence into practice.
Despite this emerging evidence, IMT is not standard practice in
most ICUs around the world, as reflected in a recent survey of
French physiotherapists.12 The challenges of implementing IMT in
ICU include the wide variety of training methods reported in the
literature9,12 and a lack of published guidelines regarding imple-
mentation in a real-world context. This article aims to describe a
practical multidisciplinary approach to IMT in ICU, drawing on the
available evidence and more than 10 years' clinical experience with
IMT in both ventilator-dependent and recently weaned patients. It
is hoped that a detailed description of this approach, which re-
quires medical, nursing, and physiotherapy input, will prove useful
to clinicians seeking to implement IMT in their own ICU.
2. Inspiratory muscle training methods
2.1. General principles of IMT in ICU patients
Inspiratory muscle training is a targeted strengthening of the
inspiratory muscles through the application of resistance during
inspiration. A recent systematic review9 has shown that IMT in ICU
patients has been conducted using whole-body training, resistive
loading, or threshold loading. There are no studies that have
compared these approaches directly. An important difference be-
tween resistive and threshold loading is that resistive loading de-
pends on the flow generated by the patient, making training
intensity variable, depending on effort. In contrast, with threshold
loading, patients must generate a preset pressure to allow airflow
for each breath, and once that threshold is achieved, inspiratory
flow is not dependent on patient effort. This means that threshold
loading is the easiest of these IMT methods to standardise and
prescribe for ICU patients.
The greatest benefits of IMT in ICU patients have been observed
in studies which use a threshold device to provide the loading
stimulus9,10,13,14 (Fig. 1), as opposed to ventilator manipulations to
provide resistance.15 Through the spring-loaded threshold mech-
anism, the prescribing clinician can be sure of the reproducibility of
the patient's efforts, facilitating accurate titration of IMT pressures
to achieve a strengthening benefit.9
Training regimes for IMT vary widely across different patient
populations (e.g. patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease and16 chronic heart failure17) and athletes18,19, including
both high-intensity interval training10 and endurance-focused
training (e.g. breathing against lower resistance for 20e30 min17).
Many ICU patients are not capable of maintaining resisted inspi-
ration over several minutes, as described in IMT protocols for other
patient groups,16,17 and in our experience, the high-intensity in-
terval approach10,11,13,14 is ideal. This approach uses few repetitions
at the highest manageable resistance to briefly load the inspiratory
muscles, while also allowing rests and recovery between sets to
maximise tolerability. Of all the approaches described in the recent
systematic review9 of IMT in ICU patients, our approach uses the
highest intensity (i.e. minimum of 50% of maximum inspiratory
pressure), and this is safe and well-tolerated in carefully selected
ICU patients.
Inspiratory muscle training can be performed in both ventilator-
dependent and independently breathing ICU patients and ideally is
conducted with the patient in an upright sitting position. As the
technicalities of application differ between these two groups, they
will be described separately.
2.2. Ventilator-dependent patients
2.2.1. Patient selection
There are several factors to consider in determining whether
IMT is appropriate for an ICU patient, and these factors are sum-
marised in Fig. 2.
As patients need to actively participate in IMT, alertness and
cooperation are essential. Patients need to be awake enough to
comprehend the purpose of the intermittent loading so that they
perceive it as a temporary training stimulus, as opposed to a sign of
deterioration or a source of distress. Thus, minimisation of sedation
is a crucial component of the multidisciplinary approach to IMT in
ICU, and based on our experience,11,20,21 alertness should be titrated
to a Riker Sedation Agitation Score22 of 4 (or equivalent).
Artificial airways do not preclude IMT as training is feasible and
safe in selected patients with either an endotracheal tube (ETT) or
tracheostomy
in
situ.

 disconnection from MV, patients must not be dependent on high
levels of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) as disconnection is
highly likely to result in de-recruitment and atelectasis. However,
for medically stable patients with PEEP levels �10 cmH2O and a
fraction of inspired oxygen <0.60, our approach to IMT does not
result in clinically or statistically significant changes in oxygen
saturation or respiratory rate,20 suggesting that atelectasis is un-
likely in this group of patients. Owing to other risks of disconnec-
tion, IMT is not feasible for patients undergoing nitric oxide
therapy, nebulised prostacyclin, or high frequency oscillation.
However, in our experience, IMT is safe with patients admitted with
a primary diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) (including those with a degree of auto-PEEP), as long as
they also satisfy the criteria described in Fig. 2.
The patient's baseline respiratory rate should be stable at less
than 25 breaths per minute, as we have found that patients will
struggle to maintain a respiratory rate faster than this during
loaded breathing (where the inspiratory valve is open for at least
1 s21,23). Haemodynamic parameters should also be stable, as IMT
could theoretically cause transient changes to intrathoracic pres-
sure which may affect venous return, although there are no data to
directly support the clinical impact of this risk. In patients with
stable blood pressure and heart rate, IMT does not cause statisti-
cally or clinically significant changes in either parameters.20
In terms of success with weaning from MV, patients most likely
to benefit from IMT are those who have failed to wean via usual
methods such as progressively longer t-piece trials over a period of
days or weeks.10,24,25 Although inspiratory muscle weakness may
be evident as early as 24e48 h following commencement of MV,5,6
very early IMT (i.e. from 48 h) has only shown minimal benefit in
terms of weaning success, despite modest improvements in inspi-
ratory muscle strength.13,14 Clearly some patients will wean suc-
cessfully from MV without any need for IMT. However, many ICU
patients who successfully wean from MV of �7 days have ongoing
deficits in inspiratory muscle strength and endurance1,2 which can
manifest as elevated dyspnoea both at rest and during exercise.1
From this perspective, our practice is to consider IMT for any ICU
patient from Day 7 of MV, with reassessment every day thereafter if
not initially suitable.
There are several conditions where IMT would not be appro-
priate for ICU patients, for example, in those who are acutely
deteriorating, experiencing severe pain or dyspnoea, or who have
shifted to a palliative treatment approach.26 As studies of IMT to
date have not included pregnant women, it is not possible to
comment on the suitability of IMT for this subgroup of ICU patients,
and the appropriateness of IMT would need to be discussed by the
multidisciplinary team in terms of potential benefits and risks for
the individual patient and fetus.
2.2.2. Equipment
A commercially available spring-loaded threshold IMT device
can usually provide an appropriate training resistance for ICU pa-
tients, ranging between 9 and 41 cmH2O (Fig. 1). This IMT device
can be connected to an ETT or tracheostomy via a flexible or rigid
connector, either directly or via an inline suction circuit (Fig. 3). For
patients with an elevated sputum load, it is advisable to maintain
the suction circuit in situ, as suctioning may be required between
IMT sets due to rapid pressure changes and sputum dislodgement.
The spring-based simple IMT device is single-patient use and
does not require maintenance and specific cleaning beyond rinsing
and air-drying the mouthpiece. In our experience, the only risk to
device integrity is that if the intensity is inadvertently dialled above
41 cmH2O, the spring is liable to break, and the whole device will
need to be replaced.
If available, a respiratory pressure meter can be used to deter-
mine the patient's baseline maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP).
Using a flexible connector, the device can be attached directly to the
ETT or tracheostomy (Fig. 4), and the patient can inhale maximally
from residual volume. The instruction “empty your lungs” may be
helpful in achieving an accurate measurement, ensuring the device
is attached to the ETT or tracheostomy just after the lungs have
been “emptied”. The patient should be coached to inhale as force-
fully as possible, and in line with established best practice, this MIP
measurement should be repeated three times to ensure consis-
tency.27 In ICU patients, MIP measurement may be a fatiguing
process, and several minutes' rest on MV may be required between
attempts.
If a respiratory pressure meter is not available, another option is
to measure the “negative inspiratory force” (NIF) through the
ventilator settings menu (often available under “special proced-
ures” or “lung mechanics”) (Fig. 5). Similarly, this measurement
should be from as close to residual volume as possible, but note that
this will not be truly possible for patients with PEEP >0 cmH2O.
Nonetheless, if the patient can produce their maximal effort, the

 NIF score may provide a reproducible surrogate value of inspiratory
muscle strength which will be useful in titrating IMT intensity.
2.2.3. Training parameters/prescription
As ICU patients often have very weak inspiratory muscles (e.g.
MIP of approximately 30e35 cm H2O when ventilated 7 days or
longer1,3), it is unlikely that they will tolerate sustained loading of
the respiratory muscles without distressing fatigue. To maximise
benefits and minimise distress, a high-intensity low-repetition
approach has been used successfully in numerous trials.10,13,14 An
intensity of at least 50% of MIP is well-tolerated, although in
practice this should be considered the minimum training threshold,
with intensity titrated upwards to the highest tolerated level where
the patient can just complete the 6th breath in a set of six
breaths.10,26
Given this high level of intensity, only few repetitions are
required, and a set of six breaths is achievable. A total package of
five sets of six breaths daily (with rest days on weekends) is well-
tolerated, and in carefully selected patients, it is unlikely to result
in any short-term deterioration in oxygen saturation, respiratory
rate, heart rate, or blood pressure, even without supplemental ox-
ygen during training. It is important that the clinician supervising
IMT returns the patient to normal ventilatory support between
sets and allows adequate rest and recovery before attempting the
next set. In our experience, most patients only require 1e2 min;
however, this rest period may be longer in very weak or highly
anxious patients.
If baseline MIP (or NIF) is not readily available, it is still possible
to titrate IMT intensity via a trial-and-error method, commencing
at a relatively low intensity (e.g. 9e15 cm H2O) and gradually
increasing intensity until the patient can just complete the 6th
breath in each set. In this case, the first IMT session is likely to
expend all the patient's energy in establishing the correct intensity,
and training on the subsequent day should commence at the pre-
established intensity.
As the patient's strength improves over time, the intensity
should be increased incrementally to continue to provide the
maximum tolerable training load. In our experience, this is typically
in the magnitude of 1e2 cmH2O every 1e2 days. Thus if a patient
commences IMT at 15 cmH2O, they may be training at 25 cmH2O
within 1 week. If the patient experiences a complication such as
ventilator-associated pneumonia, where lung function is compro-
mised by sputum load, it may be necessary to reduce the intensity
or cease training for a few days and re-establish the appropriate

252
 threshold for training once the complication has resolved and the
eligibility criteria are met again.
2.2.4. Trouble-shooting
Not surprisingly, IMT may be particularly challenging for
extremely weak patients, particularly those whose MIP is less than
18 cmH2O. For these patients, commercially available threshold
devices can be difficult if not impossible to use, as they are inca-
pable of generating the pressure required to open the valve at the
lowest setting for six breaths. For these patients, we have had some
success with commencing with a sham IMT device of sorts, where
they breathe for six breaths through just the flexible connector tube
attached to their ETT or tracheostomy, providing only the slightest
resistance. Once patients can manage five sets of six breaths at this
level for several days, we can commence with just a few breaths at
the lowest setting on the IMT device (i.e. 9 cmH2O) and gradually
build up to a full 6-breath set.
Timing of IMT is crucial with respect to ventilatory weaning. For
patients undergoing spontaneous breathing trials (SBT), we have
found that IMT is best scheduled either during the ventilator-
dependent period, or at the end of the SBT, such that the patient
can return to the ventilator for a complete rest at the end of the 5th
set. It is essential that if the patient is breathing with a deflated
tracheostomy cuff during the SBT, this cuff is reinflated during IMT
to avoid air leaks and ensure accurate training intensity. Further-
more, if the tracheostomised patient is using a speaking valve
during their SBT, this valve must be removed, and the tracheostomy
inner cannula must be changed to a non-fenestrated tube, and the
tracheostomy tube cuff must be reinflated, otherwise there will be
excessive air leak around the tracheostomy tube and training
pressures will not be reliably achieved. Clearly, close collaboration
between the clinician supervising IMT and the bedside nurse in
ICU is essential.
Another challenge of introducing IMT concerns the timing of
other rehabilitation interventions. If patients are also completing
whole-body exercise activities, we suggest scheduling IMT earlier
in the day, allowing a rest period before the next exercise session. If
patients are exhausted by whole-body exercise, they are unlikely to
have the stamina and concentration required for optimal high-
intensity IMT.
Very occasionally, for patients breathing through a humidified
ventilator circuit, the valve in the IMT device can become water-
logged and stuck within the chamber. If this is the case, the de-
vice should be replaced as it will not be providing the preset
threshold pressure expected.
In accordance with previous recommendations regarding safety
of physiotherapy interventions in ICU,28 IMT should be ceased
should any of the following occur: alteration in blood pressure > or
< or >20% resting, new arrhythmia, oxygen desaturation >10%,
pulmonary artery pressure (systolic) >60 mmHg, suspected pneu-
mothorax, and agitation risking detachment of equipment or lines
or requiring increased sedation.26 However, observational data
have demonstrated that these events are extremely unlikely in ICU
patients who meet the eligibility criteria described in Fig. 2.20
2.3. Independently breathing patients
2.3.1. Patient selection
Patients who have weaned from MV and are breathing inde-
pendently may have commenced IMT while still ventilator-
dependent or may have been unable to participate during MV. In
some studies, more than 80% of ventilator-dependent patients
cannot participate in IMT for various reasons, most commonly
because of low levels of consciousness or delirium.11,26 Nonetheless,
many patients who have successfully weaned from MV typically
have residual inspiratory muscle weakness, which may manifest as
dyspnoea at rest or during exercise.1 This is particularly the case for
patients who have experienced MV for 7 days or longer, where both
inspiratory and limb weakness are known to coexist.1,3,5 A recent
trial demonstrated that in patients who had recently weaned from
MV, just 2 weeks of daily IMT improved not only inspiratory muscle
strength but also quality of life.11 Thus patients who have recently
weaned from MV of 7 days or more are ideal candidates for IMT.
As for ventilator-dependent patients, independently breathing
patients need to be alert and able to participate during IMT and
should be medically stable without excessive pain or dyspnoea
interfering with their breathing capacity. Owing to the use of a
mouthpiece in the independently breathing population, patients
also need to be able to maintain an adequate lip seal, and thus
patients with bulbar dysfunction (e.g. due to stroke) or severe
burns around the lips and mouth would not be appropriate for IMT
(unless there is a tracheostomy in situ). Consistent with other
guidelines, IMT in independently breathing patients is also not
recommended for patients with high risk of pneumothorax or
spontaneous rib fractures or within 12 months of lung surgery
because of the high intrathoracic pressures generated during
training.16
2.3.2. Equipment
In the independently breathing patient, the same commercially
available IMT device described previously can be used; however, in
this case, the mouthpiece and nose clip are essential (unless the
patient is breathing through a tracheostomy).
A respiratory pressure meter can be used to determine the
baseline MIP before commencing training, but rather than attach-
ing the meter to an ETT or tracheostomy, the patient inhales
through a disposable mouthpiece attached to the pressure meter.
This MIP measurement should occur from as close to residual vol-
ume as possible and be repeated three times for reliability.27
2.3.3. Training parameters/prescription
Based on the randomised trial showing benefits for both
strength and quality of life, patients should commence training at
an intensity of at least 50% of MIP and complete five sets of six
breaths daily (with rest days on weekends).11 Patients should train
at the highest tolerable intensity where they can just complete the
6th breath in each set. Where MIP measurement is unavailable, an
appropriate IMT intensity can still be titrated from the patient's
ability to perform six breaths in a row.
As strength improves, the intensity should be incrementally
increased over days and weeks to ensure that training stimulus
remains adequate. This is likely to be approximately 1e2 cm H2O
every few days, but may be faster in some patients. Training should
continue for at least 2 weeks to achieve benefits in terms of quality
of life.11 While there is currently no evidence to guide training
cessation in ICU patients, we suggest continuing until the patient
achieves

and
gender
[males ¼ 120 � (0.41 � age); females ¼ 108 e (0.61 � age)].29
Extrapolating from evidence of IMT in patients with chronic lung
disease, benefits are likely to be optimal with 6e8 weeks of
training,16 thus ongoing IMT may be beneficial well beyond the ICU
admission.
2.3.4. Trouble-shooting
In patients who have weaned from MV and can continue
training for several weeks, there is the risk of a ceiling effect as they
may reach the training limit of the IMT device (i.e. 41 cmH2O).
However, this training intensity is equivalent to 50% of 82 cmH2O,
which would be within the normal predicted range for MIP in most
patients.29 In this situation, it is likely that the patient has returned
B. Bissett et al. / Australian Critical Care 32 (2019) 249e255
253
 to their baseline inspiratory muscle strength. Nonetheless, elec-
tronic IMT devices could provide higher training pressures, and
research is needed to determine whether there are any advantages
to increasing inspiratory muscle strength further in ICU survivors.
2.4. Role of the medical team
The success of IMT in ICU patients is critically dependent on the
engagement of the medical team. As patients need to actively
participate, the medical team will need to minimise sedation which
interferes with the patient's ability to comprehend and perform the
training. The medical team may also be valuable in recognising a
patient who is failing to wean from MV or who has recently weaned
from prolonged MV and referring these patients to physiotherapy
or respiratory therapy staff for IMT.
Furthermore, an appreciation of the nature of IMT as a poten-
tially fatiguing stimulus will allow the medical team to prescribe
ventilatory weaning plans which incorporate IMT at suitable time
frames (e.g. towards the end of a SBT, rather than at the beginning).
Clearly close collaboration between doctors and the rest of the
multidisciplinary team is essential for the success of IMT in ICU
patients.
2.5. Role of the ICU nurse
The beside nurse coordinates many therapies for the ICU pa-
tient, and the nurse's understanding of the value and importance of
IMT will be critical to its success. The ICU nurse plays a pivotal role
in optimising sedation levels to maximise alertness and facilitate
IMT. Although an IMT treatment session only takes around
10e15 min, it should occur when a patient is well-positioned (i.e.
high sitting), calm, and stable so that they can concentrate on
training. Thus, the ICU nurse will need to liaise with the therapist as
to the best time of day for IMT to occur, which may be after the
patient has been hoisted into a chair or had a bed bath or
procedure.
The ICU nurse may also directly assist with sputum clearance in
ventilator-dependent patients before IMT, as sputum plugging is
likely to interfere with training. For patients with a large sputum
load, the ICU nurse may work closely with the therapist during IMT
to provide suction as required, as the rapid changes in pressure may
shift secretions unexpectedly. Furthermore, the nurse can antici-
pate the additional alarms that are likely to sound during IMT if the
patient is being removed from the ventilator and reconnected
repeatedly and work closely with the therapist to minimise the
disruptive impact of these.
As the ICU nurse is largely responsible for the success of
implementing a ventilatory weaning plan, their understanding of
the role and effects of IMT is also crucial. As IMT is providing a high
intensity stimulus, some patients may take several minutes to
recover their stable breathing pattern following training.13 In this
context, ICU nurses are best placed to provide reassurance about
the strengthening value of respiratory training, and this reassur-
ance should reduce patient anxiety. The ICU nurse can also use their
judgement about the need to return to ventilatory support should a
patient's respiratory effort necessitate this. Thus, the ICU nurse and
therapist work very closely to facilitate IMT in ICU patients,
particularly with those who are ventilator-dependent.
2.6. Role of the physiotherapist or respiratory therapist
In studies of IMT which have demonstrated benefits in ICU pa-
tients, IMT has been performed directly under the supervision of a
physiotherapist11,13,14,21 or physical or respiratory therapist.10,23,30
With a strong understanding of both respiratory pathophysiology
and exercise training principles, these health professionals are
well-skilled to initiate and progress IMT in ICU patients. Further-
more, as IMT may cause rapid changes in intrathoracic pressure and
potentially shift sputum within the airways, these therapists are
also skilled in monitoring and treating any side-effects of IMT as
they arise. Therapists can also consider the timing of IMT in relation
to other whole-body exercise interventions and ensure that
fatiguing workloads are spread across the day for an ICU patient.
Although IMT will be initiated and performed by the physio-
therapist or respiratory therapist, it is our experience that suc-
cessful IMT requires a genuinely multidisciplinary approach. This is
consistent with other rehabilitation interventions in ICU patients as
described elsewhere.31
3. Discussion
This is the first practical guide for clinicians which specifically
focuses on IMT in ICU patients. This guide is informed by evidence
which has emerged over the past 15 years,9 including randomised
trials of IMT in both ventilator-dependent and independently
breathing ICU patients. It is also underpinned by more than 10 years
of experience with using IMT as a multidisciplinary team in a mixed
ICU in a large teaching hospital,1,11,21,32 and the importance of
multidisciplinary collaboration in the success of this intervention
cannot be emphasised enough.
A limitation of this guide is that the simple device suggested
only provides training pressures from 9 to 41 cmH2O. For some very
weak patients, 9 cmH2O will be unachievable, and although some
alternative strategies have been suggested in this case, these
problems may be overcome with electronic devices which can
provide a much broader range of training pressures. These would
also be advantageous for overcoming the ceiling effect of the simple
device, as patients could also train at much higher pressures. While
a single pilot study reports favourable outcomes in tracheostom-
ised patients,33 future studies should also explore the utility and
feasibility of electronic IMT devices through ETTs and in ICU pa-
tients following successful ventilatory weaning, although the cost
and infection control requirements of such devices would need to
be considered.
Another limitation of this guide is that there is very little evi-
dence to inform clinicians about the long-term effects of IMT in ICU
patients. There is some evidence that long-term IMT can reduce the
risk of hospitalisation in patients with chronic lung disease,34
although the pattern of training employed in this study is very
different from the high intensity interval training recommended for
ICU patients. Future studies should explore whether IMT has any
effects on hospital or ICU readmission rates and whether the
quality of life benefits reported in the short term (i.e. within 2
weeks)11 have any impact on outcomes beyond the hospital stay.
Furthermore, the relationship between IMT and other rehabilita-
tion strategies (e.g. early mobilisation) is not well-understood in
ICU patients. This relationship deserves further investigation as the
balance between specific and whole-body training might be
important in optimising benefits or avoiding counterproductive
training in the longer term.
Although all the evidence to date has examined the effect of
supervised IMT in ICU patients, it is also possible that patients could
benefit from continuing IMT independently following discharge
from hospital, particularly if they are discharged before 6 weeks.
Most IMT guidelines in other populations recommend at least 6e8
weeks of IMT to maximise benefits, with some recommending a
maintenance program of two sessions per week for life to maintain
benefits in the longer term (e.g. for patients with chronic obstruc-
tive pulmonary disease).16 While future research should explore
the feasibility of unsupervised IMT in ICU survivors, it seems

 reasonable to encourage patients who have made good progress to
continue their training beyond hospital discharge.
We have presented only one approach (high-intensity IMT using a
threshold device), and the ideal training parameters for IMTare yet to
be established. However, we have learned much from the evidence of
IMT in patients with chronic lung disease, as well as endurance
athletes, and the approach for ICU patients is informed by those
principles (i.e. high-intensity interval training). It is hoped that this
guide will assist ICU clinicians in translating the best-available evi-
dence into practice by implementing IMT in their own ICUs, and if
more clinicians are using a similar approach, this will enable future
multicentre research to more robustly ascertain the impact of IMT on
patient-centred outcomes, such as quality of life. In the short term,
alongside other early and proactive rehabilitation strategies, IMT
could be considered an important element of the rehabilitation
toolkit to optimise recovery of critically ill patients.
4. Conclusions
Inspiratory muscle training is safe and feasible in selected
ventilator-dependent ICU patients and those recently weaned from
MV. Based on the available evidence, IMT is likely to enhance
weaning and improve both inspiratory muscle strength and quality
of life. The practical recommendations suggested in this guide
should enable multidisciplinary ICU teams to offer IMT as an
adjunct to rehabilitation for ICU patients, particularly those who
experience MV for 7 days or longer.
