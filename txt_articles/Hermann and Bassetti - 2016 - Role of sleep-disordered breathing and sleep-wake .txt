Role of sleep-disordered breathing and
sleep-wake disturbances for stroke and
stroke recovery
ABSTRACT
Background: Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are highly
prevalent in stroke patients. Recent studies suggest that they represent both a risk factor and
a consequence of stroke and affect stroke recovery, outcome, and recurrence.
Methods: Review of literature.
Results: Several studies have proven SDB to represent an independent risk factor for stroke.
Sleep studies in TIA and stroke patients are recommended in view of the very high prevalence
(.50%) of SDB (Class IIb, level of evidence B). Treatment of obstructive SDB with continuous
positive airway pressure is recommended given the strength of the increasing evidence in support
of a positive effect on outcome (Class IIb, level of evidence B). Oxygen, biphasic positive airway
pressure, and adaptive servoventilation may be considered in patients with central SDB.
Recently, both reduced and increased sleep duration, as well as hypersomnia, insomnia, and
restless legs syndrome (RLS), were also suggested to increase stroke risk. Mainly experimental
studies found that SWD may in addition impair neuroplasticity processes and functional stroke
recovery. Treatment of SWD with hypnotics and sedative antidepressants (insomnia), activating
antidepressants or stimulants (hypersomnia), dopaminergic drugs (RLS), and clonazepam (para-
somnias) are based on single case observations and should be used with caution.
Conclusions: SDB and SWD increase the risk of stroke in the general population and affect short-
and long-term stroke recovery and outcome. Current knowledge supports the systematic imple-
mentation of clinical procedures for the diagnosis and treatment of poststroke SDB and SWD on
stroke units. Neurology® 2016;87:1407–1416

Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) and sleep-wake disturbances (SWD) are highly prevalent in
neurologic diseases, influencing their incidence, course, and outcome, which has been linked
to sleep having neurorestorative functions.1,2 In this review, we review the data suggesting that
sleep-wake disorders represent both a risk factor and a consequence of stroke that modulate
stroke recovery and outcome. For this purpose, we performed a comprehensive PubMed search
in December 2015 with the terms sleep or sleepiness or insomnia or hypersomnia or restless legs
syndrome or periodic limb movements during sleep and stroke that achieved 2,691 hits. Articles
were selected based on their contribution to our current understanding of sleep/stroke links.
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses were extensively used to evaluate research evidence.
Diagnostic challenges and treatment recommendations are presented.

 DISTURBED SLEEP IN STROKE PATIENTS Sleep-
disordered breathing. In a meta-analysis of 29 studies
with 2,343 ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke or TIA
patients, 72%, 63%, or 38% revealed SDB defined by
an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) .5/h, .10/h, or
.20/h.3 SDB was most severe in acute stroke and
improved during stroke recovery. Fifty-three percent of
patients still exhibited an AHI .10/h after 4 weeks.3
SDB was similarly prevalent in stroke and TIA,2
indicating that SDB mostly represents a preexisting
condition. In a cross-sectional study on 335 acute
stroke or TIA patients, SDB was associated with wake-
up stroke, when accompanied by cardiac right-to-left
shunts,4 indicating that SDB may provoke paradoxical
embolism. Initial studies found no link between SDB
and stroke topography. Population-based5 and clinical6
cohorts recently noted an association of SDB with
brainstem stroke, suggesting that lower cranial nerve
dysfunction aggravates SDB. The most common form
of SDB is obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is
caused by cessation of nasal flow due to upper airway
collapse. Not rarely, stroke patients reveal combinations
of OSA and central types of SDB; that is, central sleep
apnea (CSA) and Cheyne-Stokes breathing (CSB).2,7
CSA is characterized by cyclic fluctuations in
breathing drive and hyperpneas alternating with ap-
neas or hypopneas. CSA/CSB was first described in
bilateral stroke associated with disturbed conscious-
ness or heart failure. Heart failure is associated with
nocturnal rostral fluid shifts decreasing leg volume
and increasing neck circumference, which predisposes
to upper airway collapse.8 More recently, CSB during
sleep was found in unilateral stroke with preserved
consciousness without overt heart failure. CSA/CSB
in acute stroke was linked to occult cardiac dysfunc-
tion9 or disruption of the central autonomic net-
works.2 CSA/CSB improves in the subacute stroke
phase. In chronic stroke, CSA/CSB is strongly asso-
ciated with heart failure.9
Hypersomnia/excessive sleep/excessive daytime sleepiness
(EDS). Hypersomnia, i.e., increased sleep, is mostly
found after subcortical and pontomesencephalic stroke.
In 285 consecutive patients evaluated after 21 6 18
months, hypersomnia (27% of patients with sleep
needs $10 h/d), EDS (28% with Epworth Sleepiness
Scale score $10) and fatigue (46% with Fatigue Sever-
ity Scale score $4.0) were frequent.2 Although hyper-
somnia improves during the first months poststroke,
fatigue can persist for years. The most dramatic form
of poststroke hypersomnia is noted after paramedian
thalamic stroke. Initially, patients exhibit severe hyper-
somnia and sleep-like behavior during up to 20 h/d,
associated with attention, cognition, and memory
deficits.10,11 Hypersomnia improves within months,
whereas cognitive deficits often persist, particularly
after left-sided and bilateral stroke.11 Patients with
bilateral stroke may report increased sleep needs for
years.
Insomnia/reduced sleep. Insomnia, i.e., difficulty in fall-
ing and staying asleep, is highly prevalent in stroke pa-
tients. During the first months poststroke, insomnia
prevalence may be as high as ;50%.2 One third of
insomnias appear de novo; two thirds of patients have
insomnia already before stroke. Poststroke insomnia
often results from environmental factors (light, noise
on stroke units) or comorbidities (SDB, depression,
pain). Less commonly, insomnia may be directly
related to brain damage. Near-complete loss of sleep
was reported after pontomesencephalic stroke.2 In
paramedian thalamic stroke, insomnia may reflect the
absence of sleep spindles.11 In military veterans with
penetrating brain injury, insomnia was associated with
left dorsomedial prefrontal cortex damage.12
Restless legs syndrome (RLS)/periodic limb movements
during sleep (PLMS). In 2 series of 96 or 137 patients
examined within 15 days or at 1 month poststroke,
12% or 13% fulfilled RLS criteria, i.e., urge for limb
movements that improves with activity and worsens
in the evenings and nights and at rest.13,14 Two thirds
of patients had bilateral RLS symptoms; one third had
unilateral symptoms contralateral to the stroke.13 RLS
was frequently accompanied by PLMS, i.e., involun-
tary periodic limb movements during non-REM
(NREM) sleep. Patients exhibiting RLS exhibited
a higher neck circumference and higher diabetes
prevalence than patients without RLS.14 Sleep quality
was reduced in these patients. PLMS are even more
prevalent than RLS in stroke patients. In a case-control
study of 35 patients with acute supratentorial ischemic
stroke, a PLMS index .5/h was found in 77% of
stroke patients but only 29% of age- and sex-
matched controls.15 PLMS were contralateral to the
stroke in 70% and bilateral in 30%.
REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD). In RBD, patients
act out dreams, exhibiting loss of atonia and increased
phasic muscle activity during REM sleep. Following
early RBD observations in patients with brainstem in-
farcts,2 a recent assessment on 119 ischemic stroke
patients estimated the RBD prevalence as ;11%.16
Forty-six percent of patients with RBD had brainstem
infarcts.16
DISTURBED SLEEP AS STROKE RISK FACTOR
Sleep-disordered breathing. Following a seminal study
on 1,022 patients admitted to a sleep laboratory, which
reported an association of SDB defined as AHI $5/h
with incident stroke, TIA, and death over 6 years
follow-up after adjustment for vascular risk factors,17
4 population-based studies evaluated the predictive
value of SDB for stroke risk:

 1. The Wisconsin sleep cohort study included 1,475
participants.18 SDB defined by AHI $20/h was
associated in a cross-sectional analysis with history
of stroke after adjustment for age, sex, and vascular
risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 4.33; confidence
interval [CI] 1.32–14.24). In a longitudinal anal-
ysis including 1,189 participants, 22 incident
first-ever strokes were noted over 4 years. SDB
predicted stroke in a univariate regression. After
adjustment for age, sex, and body mass index
(BMI), this association was no longer significant.
2. In the Vitoria Sleep Project, 394 noninstitution-
alized stroke-free participants .70 years were fol-
lowed up over 6 years (incident 20 strokes).19 SDB
defined by AHI .30/h predicted stroke in
a regression adjusted for sex (hazard ratio [HR]
2.52; CI 1.04–6.01). Due to limited statistical
power, age and vascular risk factors could not be
adjusted for.
3. The Sleep Heart Health Study was a population-
based cohort of 5,422 participants $40 years fol-
lowed up over 8.7 years.20 A total of 193 strokes
occurred. OSA predicted ischemic stroke in mul-
tivariable regressions adjusted for age, sex, and
vascular risk factors in men (HR [4th vs 1st AHI
quartile] 2.86; CI 1.10–7.39) but not in women
(HR 1.21; CI 0.65–2.24).
4. In a nationwide survey among 4.5 million Danish
citizens, 33,274 participants developed sleep
apnea over 11 years (mean age 53 years; 79%
men), of whom 44% received persistent continu-
ous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.21 A
total of 150,294 ischemic strokes occurred. Sleep
apnea predicted ischemic stroke after adjustment
for age, sex, and vascular risk factors (HR 1.23; CI
1.11–1.36). This effect was specifically noted in
participants ,50 years (HR 1.80; CI 1.36–2.39).
A
meta-analysis
of
prospective
clinical
and
population-based studies concluded that SDB is an
independent stroke predictor (OR 2.24; CI 1.57–
3.19).22 Stroke risk increased with AHI.22 The meta-
analysis stated that evidence was sparse in women.
Most recently, a Taiwanese group evaluated sex-
related consequences of SDB in a large cohort of
29,961 participants with SDB who were compared
with 119,844 age- and sex-matched controls without
SDB.23 Over a follow-up of up to 14 years, stroke
incidence was increased in both sexes, notably more
strongly in women than men (HR 1.44 [CI 1.20–
1.72] and HR 1.21 [CI 1.01–1.24], respectively, after
adjustment for age and vascular risk factors). Interest-
ingly, stroke incidence was increased most strongly in
young women #35 years (HR 4.90 [CI 1.93–12.40]).
The mechanisms underlying the elevated stroke risk
in SDB patients have been summarized previously.24
Recurrent hypoxia in OSA is accompanied by intra-
thoracic pressure changes, sympathetic activation, and
blood pressure swings, which via oxidative stress, endo-
thelial dysfunction, and inflammation predispose to
drug-resistant arterial hypertension, atherosclerosis,
cardiac arrhythmia, hypercoagulation, heart failure,
and paradoxical embolisms. CPAP therapy attenuates
these consequences.
Hypersomnia/excessive sleep/EDS. A meta-analysis of
11 community-representative studies with 559,252
participants and 11,695 stroke events revealed that
long sleep, mostly defined as $8–9 hours sleep/
night in questionnaires, is an independent predictor
of incident stroke after adjustment for age, sex,
vascular risk factors, and comorbidities (HR 1.45;
CI 1.30–1.62).25 In 2 population-based studies
involving 9,095 participants who were followed up
over 5.1 years each (in total 208 incident strokes),
significant (Epworth Sleepiness Scale $10/24) or
frequent EDS predicted stroke after adjustment for
age, sex, vascular risk factors, and comorbidities (HR
3.00; CI 1.57–5.73, and HR 2.10; CI 1.13–3.89,
respectively).26,27 In a cross-sectional analysis within
one of these studies, which included 1,244 stroke-free
participants receiving MRI, long sleep was associated
with subcortical white matter hyperintensities,28
suggesting that excessive sleep may result from
cerebral small vessel disease, reflecting markers of
subclinical atherosclerosis.
Insomnia/reduced sleep. After earlier inconsistent stud-
ies, a recent meta-analysis found that short sleep,
mostly defined as #5–6 hours sleep/night in
questionnaires, is an independent predictor of
incident stroke after adjustment for age, sex,
vascular risk factors, and comorbidities, albeit with
lower HR than long sleep (1.15; CI 1.07–1.24).25
Stroke risk might depend on the presence of clinical
sleep complaints. In 2 population-representative
case-control studies including 21,438 and 22,040
insomniacs, which were followed up over 4 or 10
years,
respectively
(1,545
and
1,049
incident
strokes), physician-diagnosed insomnia predicted
stroke after adjustment for age, sex, vascular risk
factors, depression, anxiety, and socioeconomic
status (HR 1.54; 1.38–1.72 and 1.85; 1.62–
2.12).29,30 In a Swedish population-based cohort of
41,192 participants followed up over 13.2 years
(4,031 vascular events, including 1,685 incident
strokes), short sleep, defined as #5 hours sleep/
night,
predicted
cardiovascular
events
when
associated with difficulty falling asleep, difficulty
maintaining sleep, early morning awakening, or
nonrestorative sleep, but not when not associated
with these complaints.31 Possible reasons for the
elevated stroke risk may include chronic stress.

 RLS/PLMS. After inconsistent findings from cross-
sectional studies regarding the association of RLS
with stroke and coronary heart disease (CHD),
longitudinal studies in population-based cohorts
and health professionals reported that RLS at
baseline predicts incident CHD and death,32 but
not stroke,33,34 in addition to age, sex, and vascular
risk factors. In the 2 stroke studies,33,34 54,558
participants were followed up over 2.1–7.3 years
(673 incident strokes).
In 2 population-representative cohorts including
5,620 and 7,392 participants who were followed up
over up to 8.1 years, vascular risk factors, namely arte-
rial hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and
BMI, predicted incident RLS.34,35 In the larger of
these studies, incident RLS predicted incident stroke,
which in this study was noted in 397 participants.35
The combined evidence of these studies is still insuf-
ficient for justifying final conclusions about mutual
links between RLS and stroke.
In 1,093 patients with end-stage renal disease,
which carries a particularly high vascular risk, RLS
predicted stroke over a 3.7-year follow-up after
adjustment for age, sex, and vascular risk factors
(HR 2.64; 1.49–4.91).36 It has been suggested that
RLS consequences depend on the duration of RLS
complaints. In the largest CHD study, comprising
70,977 participants with 5.6 years of follow-up,
RLS predicted CHD when RLS complaints persisted
for $3 years.32 RLS-associated PLMS are accompa-
nied by short-lasting elevations of blood pressure and
sympathetic hyperactivity.2 Whether these auto-
nomic responses are able to induce arterial hyperten-
sion remains to be shown.
DISTURBED SLEEP AND STROKE RECOVERY
AND OUTCOME Sleep-disordered breathing. In a sys-
tematic review, 10 studies including 1,203 stroke
and TIA patients were identified, in which effects of
SDB on stroke outcome, i.e., death and recurrent vas-
cular events, were analyzed.37 All studies reported ele-
vated risks for death or vascular events, respectively.
Most studies had follow-ups #2 years. Only 2 studies
evaluating cohorts of 132 and 166 patients with 10 or
7 years follow-up (116 and 89 deaths, respectively)
were truly powered for multivariable regression
analyses. In these studies, OSA, defined by AHI
$15/h or AHI $20/h, predicted death (HR 1.76;
1.05–2.95) or nonfatal cardiovascular events (namely
recurrent stroke) (HR 1.76; 1.12–2.68) in addition to
age, sex, vascular risk factors, and Barthel Index.
Earlier smaller studies reported that SDB negatively
affects
poststroke
arterial
blood
pressure,
early
neurologic recovery, and hospitalization duration.2
These studies were not powered for multivariable
analyses.
Hypersomnia/excessive sleep/EDS. Hypersomnia/EDS
impairs stroke recovery, as shown in a cohort of 213
stroke patients admitted to an acute rehabilitation unit,
in which hypersomnia detected by rehabilitation thera-
pists predicted disability and nursing home referral at
discharge.38 In a nationwide register of 8,194 stroke
patients, the presence of fatigue 2 years poststroke was
associated with nursing home referral and predicted
mortality in the following year (297 deaths) after
adjustment for age, sex, stroke type, and activities of
daily living.39 This study did not adjust for medical
conditions unrelated to the stroke (e.g., infections, car-
diovascular diseases).
Insomnia/reduced
sleep. In acute stroke patients,
insomnia assessed by questionnaires was associated
with poor life satisfaction in addition to depression
and severe stroke.2
In experimental stroke models, sleep loss/deprivation
was found to augment brain injury and impair neuro-
plasticity,40 whereas drugs that promote NREM and
REM sleep had a favorable effect on neuroplasticity
and stroke recovery.41 In 13 chronic stroke patients,
imitation-based speech therapy increased slow wave
activity (SWA) during sleep evaluated by high-
density EEG.42 SWA in speech-related areas correlated
closely with improvements of aphasia scores.42 These
data argue in favor of a sustained role of NREM sleep
in stroke recovery.
RLS/PLMS. In 96 acute stroke patients followed up
over 1 year, patients with RLS (12.5%) had a higher
neck circumference, poorer sleep quality, and higher
diabetes prevalence than patients without RLS.14
Stroke recovery evaluated by the modified Rankin
Scale and Barthel Index was worse in RLS than
non-RLS patients after adjustment for diabetes and
BMI. Due to the limited size of this study, other risk
factors could not be adjusted for.
DIAGNOSIS AND THERAPY Sleep-disordered breathing.
SDB can be accurately diagnosed in stroke patients by
respiratory polygraphy, in which nasal airflow, respira-
tory movements, and capillary oxygen saturation are
monitored. More simple but less accurate screening
methods are oximetry or nasal airflow measurement,
which can be combined with SDB questionnaires
(e.g., Berlin questionnaire). CPAP is the treatment of
choice for OSA. In patients with CSA/CSB, oxygen,
biphasic positive airway pressure, or adaptive servoventi-
lation may be considered. Mechanical ventilation and
rarely tracheostomy may become necessary in patients
with central hypoventilation.
Eight randomized studies investigated effects of
CPAP poststroke (table 1),43–51 of which 545,48–51 were
initiated in the acute stroke phase, i.e., the first week
poststroke. Most studies noted acceptable CPAP

a nonsignificant tendency towards better neurologic
improvement in patients receiving CPAP.50 The 3 re-
maining studies reported no significant outcome
changes, but beneficial associations of CPAP use with
at least some aspects of daytime wakefulness,51 neuro-
logic recovery,44 or low recurrent vascular event rates.45
These findings contrast with the multitude of
negative pharmacologic stroke studies. However,
some CPAP studies were designed as feasibility
studies. These studies were not powered for demon-
strating outcome changes. In several studies, pri-
mary
outcomes
were
not
predefined.
Larger
multicenter studies with predefined outcomes,
e.g., Sleep Disordered Breathing in Transient Ische-
mic Attack (TIA)/Ischemic Stroke and Continuous
Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) Treatment Effi-
cacy (SAS-CARE) (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/
ct2/show/NCT01097967), are ongoing. Their re-
sults are eagerly awaited.
A small percentage of stroke patients worldwide
receive CPAP treatment. Yet the American Heart
Association recently included recommendations on
diagnosis and treatment of SDB, stating that (1)
a sleep study might be considered for patients with
ischemic stroke or TIA on the basis of the very high
prevalence of sleep apnea in this population and (2)
CPAP treatment might be considered for patients
with ischemic stroke and TIA and sleep apnea, given
the emerging evidence in support of improved out-
comes (Class IIb evidence, B recommendation).52
In a crossover study on 18 ischemic stroke pa-
tients with AHI .5/h randomized to positional
therapy (therapeutic pillow) or no positional therapy
within
14
days
poststroke,
positional
therapy
reduced AHI46 (Class III evidence; tables 1 and 2).
Median and minimum oxygen saturation remained
unchanged.
In an observation study on 10 ischemic stroke pa-
tients with AHI .15/h not eligible for CPAP at
4.8 6 3.7 days poststroke, transnasal insufflation
with high-flow air (18 L/min) moderately reduced
AHI from 40.7/h to 31.0/h and increased slow wave
sleep.53 In 15 ischemic stroke patients with predom-
inant CSA not adherent to CPAP at 11 months post-
stroke, adaptive servoventilation reduced EDS.54
Until further studies become available, adaptive ser-
voventilation should be used with caution, since
increased mortality has been reported during adaptive
servoventilation in SDB patients with systolic heart
failure.55
Weight loss should improve SDB, but was not sys-
tematically examined. Patient handling should always
include prevention and therapy of secondary compli-
cations (respiratory infections, pain) and cautious use
of alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs, which nega-
tively affect breathing during sleep. In stroke patients
with SDB, severe motor deficits (specifically facial/
bulbar palsy), cognitive deficits, aphasia, and depres-
sion may represent factors compromising CPAP
compliance.56

 Hypersomnia/excessive sleep/EDS. With the exception of
very severe cases, hypersomnia is often unrecognized in
clinical practice. Actigraphy allows to detect changes of
sleep/rest needs in stroke patients,10 but may have limited
use in patients with severe motor deficits. Sleep question-
naires (e.g., Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Severity
Scale), which evaluate EDS and fatigue, may underesti-
mate SWD in stroke patients with disturbed self-
perception or communication skills. Polysomnography,
multiple sleep latency tests, and maintenance of
wakefulness tests are reserved for selected cases. The
correlation of poststroke SWD and sleep EEG is
limited
when
brain
damage
includes
thalamo-
cortical networks.11 Polysomnography typically reveals
a reduction, less commonly an increase of NREM or
REM sleep.
Treatment of poststroke hypersomnia/EDS is
challenging (table 2). In patients with paramedian
thalamic stroke, improvement of sleep patterns was
reported with 20–40 mg bromocriptine, 200 mg
modafinil, or 20–50 mg methylphenidate (Class IV
evidence).10 A favorable effect on early stroke recovery
was observed after levodopa (100 mg/d) or methyl-
phenidate (5–30 mg/d), which may at least partly be
related to improved wakefulness.2 Stimulating anti-
depressants may also improve hypersomnia. Whether
treatment of hypersomnia, EDS, or fatigue improves
stroke outcome and recurrent risk needs to be shown.
Insomnia/reduced sleep. The presence of insomnia is
often overlooked in clinical practice. Questionnaires
and actigraphy can be useful to recognize insomnia,

 but may underestimate SWD (see above). Polysom-
nography is mainly used for detecting secondary in-
somnias (e.g., related to SDB or RLS/PLMS).
Treatment of poststroke insomnia includes place-
ment of patients in quiet rooms at night, protection
from noise and light, light exposure and physical
activity during the day, and, where necessary, tempo-
rary use of hypnotics that are relatively free of cogni-
tive and muscle-relaxant effects, such as zolpidem,
which in a small study of 12 stroke patients had sim-
ilar effects on total sleep time and sleep quality as
lorazepam2 and may have beneficial effects on stroke
recovery based on experimental stroke studies.57 Ben-
zodiazepines may worsen SDB and neuropsycholog-
ical deficits and lead to reemergence of motor deficits
(table 2). Sedative antidepressants may improve post-
stroke insomnia (table 2). In 51 stroke patients, 60
mg/d mianserin improved insomnia, also in patients
without depression (Class III evidence).2
In case-control studies, hypnotics elevated stroke
risk. In 12,747 ischemic stroke patients matched
with participants without stroke, zolpidem use
was dose-dependently associated with ischemic
stroke risk (OR 1.50 for .470 mg zolpidem/y).58
In a cohort of 38,671 patients on benzodiazepines
matched with patients without benzodiazepines,
a high annual benzodiazepine dose ($4 g) or long
duration
of
benzodiazepine
use
($95
days)
increased stroke incidence.59 Further studies are
needed to delineate effects of hypnotics on stroke
recovery and recurrence.
RLS/PLMS. RLS is a clinical diagnosis, while PLMS
diagnosis requires polysomnography. RLS symptoms
are often not perceived by stroke patients.
Patients with stroke-related RLS/PLMS can be
treated with dopamine agonists (ropinirole 0.25–1
mg/d, pramipexole 0.125–0.5 mg/d) or gabapentin
(150–300 mg/d) (table 2). Using dopamine agonists,
Lee et al.13 reported marked relief in almost all pa-
tients. Spontaneous improvement was noted in
approximately 1 of 4 patients.13 Antidepressants, neu-
roleptics, metoclopramide, and lithium should be
avoided wherever possible, because they may aggra-
vate RLS/PLMS. Whether RLS/PLMS treatment in-
fluences stroke outcome or recurrence needs to be
shown.
REM sleep behavior disorder. RBD can be suspected on
clinical grounds but diagnosis requires videopolysom-
nography. Clonazepam at bedtime efficiently im-
proves RBD. Although Class IV evidence, stroke
patients with RBD may receive clonazepam (0.5–
2.0 mg) (table 2). Alcohol, serotonin reuptake inhib-
itors, stimulants, and selegiline aggravate RBD. They
should be avoided in RBD.
FUTURE DIRECTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Systematic approaches for the diagnosis and treat-
ment of SDB and SWD should be implemented in
the management of stroke and TIA. Oximetry or
nasal flow measurement can suggest SDB, which
should be confirmed by respirography before treat-
ment. Careful patient histories, questionnaires, and
actigraphies improve the detection of SWD. Treat-
ment is relevant for stroke recovery and outcome,
but should be used thoughtfully considering potential
side effects.
