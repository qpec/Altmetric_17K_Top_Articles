Objectives:
 Contrast-enhanced
 computed
 tomography
 (CT)  provides
 essential
 cross-sectional
 imaging
data
 in patients
 with  suspected
 pleural
 malignancy
 (PM).  The  performance
 of  CT  in routine
 practice
 may
be
 lower
 than  in previously
 reported
 research.
 We  assessed
 this  relative  to  ‘real-life’
 factors
 including
 use
of
 early
 arterial-phase
 contrast  enhancement
 (by CT  pulmonary
 angiography
 (CTPA))
 and  non-specialist
radiology
 reporting.
Materials
 and methods:
 Routinely
 acquired
 and reported
 CT  scans  in  patients  recruited  to  the  DIAPHRAGM
study
 (a  prospective,
 multi-centre
 observational
 study  of  mesothelioma
 biomarkers)
 between
 January
2014
 and  April  2016  were
 retrospectively
 reviewed.
 CT  reports  were  classified
 as  malignant
 if
 they
included
 specific
 terms  e.g. “suspicious
 of  malignancy”,
 “stage
 M1a”  and  benign
 if
 others
 were
 used e.g.
“indeterminate”,
 “no cause  identified”.
 All  patients
 followed
 a standard
 diagnostic
 algorithm.
 The  diag-
nostic
 performance
 of  CT  (overall
 and  based  on  the  above
 factors)
 was  assessed
 using
 2  ×
 2  Contingency
Tables.
Results:
 30/345  (9%)
 eligible
 patients
 were  excluded
 (non-contrast
 (n  =  13)  or  non-contiguous
 CT  (n =
 4),
incomplete
 follow-up
 (n  =  13)).  195/315
 (62%)
 patients  studied
 had  PM;  90%  were  cyto-histologically
confirmed.
 172/315  (55%)  presented
 as an  acute
 admission,
 of  whom
 31/172
 (18%)  had  CTPA. Overall,
CT
 sensitivity
 was 58%  (95%  CI 51–65%);
 specificity
 was  80%  (95%  CI
 72–87%).
 Sensitivity
 of
 CTPA  (per-
formed
 in  31/315  (10%))
 was  lower  (27%  (95%  CI  9–53%))
 than  venous-phase
 CT  (61%  (95%  CI  53–68%)
p
 =  0.0056).
 Sensitivity
 of
 specialist
 thoracic
 radiologist
 reporting
 was  higher
 (68%  (95%  CI  55–79%))
 than
non-specialist
 reporting
 (53%  (95%  CI 44–62%)
 p  =  0.0488).
 Specificity
 was  not  significantly
 different.
Conclusion:
 The  diagnostic
 performance
 of  CT  in  routine
 clinical
 practice
 is  insufficient
 to  exclude
 or
confirm
 PM.
 A
 benign  CT  report  should  not  dissuade
 pleural  sampling
 where
 the presence  of primary
 or
secondary
 pleural  malignancy
 would
 alter  management.
 Sensitivity
 is  lower
 with
 non-thoracic
 radiology
reporting
 and  particularly
 low  using  CTPA.

 Reports
 regarding
 the
 performance
of
 CT
 in
 this
 setting
 show
 considerable
 heterogeneity.
 Previous
prospective
 studies
 utilising
 research
 study-specific
 reporting
 in
small
 populations
 have
 reported
 sensitivities
 of
 84–96%
 and
 speci-
ficities
 of
 80–100%
 for
 PM
 [4,5]
 However,
 a
 recent
 retrospective
review
 of
 the
 diagnostic
 performance
 of
 CT
 in
 370
 patients
 referred
for
 Local
 Anaesthetic
 Thoracoscopy
 (LAT)
 found
 lower
 sensitiv-

 that
 approximately
 one
 third
 of
 patients
 with
 PM
 may
 have
a
 benign
 CT
 report
 in
 routine
 practice.
 However,
 this
 study
 may
have
 selected
 a
 particularly
 difficult
 to
 diagnose
 population
 since
all
 cases
 had
 non-diagnostic
 or
 negative
 pleural
 aspiration
 cytol-
ogy,
 by
 definition.
 We  performed
 a
 retrospective
 cohort
 study
 in
which
 the
 primary
 aim
 was
 to
 reassess
 the
 performance
 of
 routinely
acquired
 and
 reported
 CT
 in
 a
 lessselected
 population
 We  retro-
spectively
 reviewed
 CT
 reports
 in
 consecutive
 patients
 recruited
to
 the
 DIAPHRAGM
 study
 (ISRCTN10079972).
 This
 is
 a
 multi-
centre
 observational
 study
 of
 mesothelioma
 biomarkers,
 recruiting
patients
 at
 first
 presentation
 of
 suspected
 pleural
 malignancy.
 In
this
 study,
 patients
 are
 generally
 recruited
 before,
 or
 at
 diagnos-
tic
 pleural
 aspiration,
 in
 an
 ‘intention-to-diagnose’
 setting.
 Most
patients
 with
 suspected
 PM
 are
 likely
 to
 be
 eligible
 (see
 Section
2.1)
 and
 CT
 scans
 are
 undertaken
 as
 part
 of
 routine
 care.
 These
 are
therefore
 subject
 to
 the
 variations
 in
 CT
 acquisition
 and
 radiology
reporting
 that
 exist
 in
 clinical
 practice,
 including
 the
 use
 of
 arterial
phase
 contrast
 CT
 (as
 CTPA)
 and
 non-specialist
 thoracic
 radiology
reporting.
 Importantly,
 the
 DIAPHRAGM
 study
 incorporates
 robust
diagnostic
 assessment
 of
 all
 cases,
 including
 access
 to
 LAT,
 where
indicated,
 and
 mandatory
 follow-up
 of
 benign
 cases.

 CT
 analyses
All
 CT
 scans
 were
 reported
 as
 part
 of
 routine
 clinical
 activity
 and
underwent
 no
 study-specific
 reporting.
 Each
 report
 was
 reviewed
by
 a
 respiratory
 physician
 (ST)
 who
 classified
 these
 as
 malignant
or
 benign
 based
 on
 specific
 terms
 in
 the
 report.
 Malignant
 reports
included
 terms
 that
 increased
 the
 level
 of
 pre-CT
 clinical
 suspicion
regarding
 PM,
 specifically,
 “suspicious
 of
 malignancy”,
 “probable
malignant
 effusion”,
 “disseminated
 malignancy”,
 “suggestive
 of
malignancy”,
 “stage
 M1a”
 or
 “suggest
 sampling
 of
 effusion
 for
 cytol-
ogy”.
 CT
 reports
 without
 terms
 that
 increased
 the
 level
 of
 pre-CT
clinical
 suspicion
 were
 classified
 as
 benign.
 Specific
 terms
 that
 pos-
itively
 identified
 benign
 reports
 were
 “indeterminate”,
 “no
 cause
identified”,
 “no
 evidence
 of
 malignancy”,
 “differential
 diagnosis
is
 wide”,
 “appearances
 not
 obviously
 malignant”
 or
 if
 alternative
pathology
 was
 suggested
 as
 the
 likely
 diagnosis,
 e.g.
 tuberculous
pleurisy.
 Thoracic
 radiologists
 were
 defined
 as
 radiologists
 with
 a
primary
 subspecialty
 interest
 in
 chest
 imaging,
 including
 involve-
ment
 in
 thoracic
 oncology
 multidisciplinary
 teams.
 The
 phase
 of
 CT
contrast
 enhancement
 was
 recorded
 as
 CTPA
 (pulmonary
 arterial
phase)
 or
 non-CTPA
 (venous
 phase).
2.3.
 Diagnostic
 methods
All
 patients
 were
 subject
 to
 robust
 diagnostic
 assessment
 based
on
 a
 pre-specified
 algorithm
 (see
 Fig.
 1).
 PM
 was
 cytologically
 or
histologically
 confirmed
 where
 possible.
 Where
 not
 possible
 PM
was
 diagnosed
 by
 MDT
 consensus
 and
 demonstration
 of
 progres-
sion
 on
 follow-up
 imaging.
 Patients
 with
 benign
 cytology
 (+/−
histology
 if
 pursued)
 and
 evidence
 of
 resolution
 or
 lack
 of
 progres-
sion
 of
 pleural
 disease
 after
 a
 minimum
 of
 6
 months
 of
 follow-up
were
 classified
 as
 benign.
 Patients
 with
 less
 than
 6
 months
 of
 clin-
ical
 follow-up
 were
 excluded
 from
 analyses.
2.4.
 Statistical
 analysis
Data
 are
 presented
 as
 mean
 (±standard
 deviation
 (SD))
 or
median
 (±Interquartile
 Range
 (IQR))
 depending
 on
 the
 distribu-
tion
 of
 the
 data.
 CT
 classification
 (malignant
 or
 benign)
 and
 the
 final
pleural
 diagnosis
 (malignant
 or
 benign)
 were
 compared
 using
 2
 ×
 2
Contingency
 Tables,
 generating
 sensitivity,
 specificity
 and
 associ-
ated
 95%
 confidence
 intervals
 (CI).
 Negative
 and
 positive
 predictive
values
 (NPV
 and
 PPV)
 were
 calculated
 using
 standard
 definitions.
Sensitivity
 and
 specificity
 of
 CTPA
 vs.
 non-CTPA
 and
 specialist
 vs.
non-specialist
 radiology
 reporting
 were
 compared
 using
 the
 Chi-
Squared
 test.
 Analyses
 were
 performed
 using

 Discussion
The
 overall
 sensitivity
 and
 specificity
 of
 contrast-enhanced
 CT
for
 PM
 in
 this
 study
 were
 58%
 (95%
 CI
 51–65%)
 and
 80%
 (95%
 CI
72–87%),
 respectively,
 resulting
 in
 a
 PPV
 of
 83%
 (95%
 CI
 75–89%)
and
 a
 NPV
 of
 54%
 (95%
 CI
 46–61%).
 Almost
 half
 of
 the
 patients
 with
PM
 had
 a
 benign
 CT
 report.
 This
 strongly
 suggests
 that
 a
 benign
 CT
report
 should
 not
 dissuade
 clinicians
 from
 pursuing
 invasive
 pleu-
ral
 investigations
 if
 the
 presence
 of
 primary
 or
 secondary
 pleural
malignancy
 would
 alter
 management.
 The
 sensitivity
 (27%
 (95%
 CI
9–53%))
 and
 NPV
 (40%
 (20%–63%))
 of
 arterial
 phase
 CT
 (as
 CTPA)
was
 particularly
 low.
 Even
 allowing
 for
 the
 small
 numbers
 and
 wide
confidence
 intervals
 around
 these
 data,
 the
 use
 of
 CTPA
 images
 to
diagnose
 benign
 pleural
 disease
 must
 seriously
 be
 questioned.
The
 performance
 of
 CT
 reported
 in
 the
 current
 study
 is
 signif-
icantly
 inferior
 to
 results
 from
 some
 earlier
 studies.
 For
 example,
Hierholzer
 et
 al.
 reported
 sensitivity
 of
 93%
 and
 specificity
 of
 87%
 in
42
 patients
 [5],
 while
 Metintas
 reported
 up
 to
 70%
 sensitivity
 and
96%
 specificity
 in
 215
 patients
 [3].
 These
 differences
 may
 reflect
the
 involvement
 of
 specialist
 thoracic
 radiologists
 in
 these
 research
projects.
 We  certainly
 found
 that
 thoracic
 radiology
 reporting
 was
associated
 with
 greater
 sensitivity,
 albeit
 at
 the
 potential
 cost
 of
a
 reduction
 in
 specificity
 (which
 did
 not
 reach
 statistical
 signifi-
cance).

 results
 of
 the
 current

 are
 concordant
 with

malignancy
 is
 high
 and
 the
 patient
 is
 fit
 for
 the
 procedure.
 The
population
 studied
 in
 this
 previous
 study
 could
 therefore
 be
 con-
sidered
 to
 be
 a
 more
 difficult
 to
 diagnose
 cohort
 to
 the
 current
 study
cohort,
 in
 which
 89/315
 (28%)
 patients
 had
 diagnostic
 pleural
 cytol-
ogy
 and
 only
 35%
 (111/315)
 required
 a
 subsequent
 pleural
 biopsy.
A
 confident
 clinical
 diagnosis
 of
 benign
 disease
 was
 achieved
 in
the
 remaining
 37%
 (115/315)
 without
 the
 need
 for
 further
 sam-
pling.
 The
 incidence
 of
 Mesothelioma
 was
 also
 significantly
 lower
in
 the
 current
 study
 (19%)
 than
 in
 the
 earlier
 Hallifax
 study
 (54.5%)
reflecting
 the
 earlier
 recruitment
 required
 in
 DIAPHRAGM.
 These
factors
 all
 define
 the
 current
 study
 cohort
 as
 an
 easier
 to
 diagnose
population
 than
 the
 Hallifax
 study
 [6]
 and
 one
 that
 is
 more
 rep-
resentative
 of
 the
 intention-to-diagnose
 population
 in
 which
 CT
 is
routinely
 used
 in
 patients
 with
 suspected
 PM.
 Despite
 this
 and
 the
use
 of
 similar
 methods,
 CT
 sensitivity
 and
 NPV
 were
 both
 lower
 in
the
 current
 study
 (58%
 (95%
 CI
 51–65%)
 and
 54%
 (95%
 CI
 46–61%))
than
 in
 Hallifax
 et
 al.
 with
 similar
 PM
 prevalence
 (62%
 herein
 vs.
57%
 [6])
 and
 specificity.
Possible
 explanations
 for
 this
 may
 include
 differences
 in
 the
type
 of
 CT
 images
 acquired
 and
 the
 reporting
 performed.
 The
 cur-
rent
 study
 was
 recruited
 across
 22
 UK
 and
 Irish
 hospitals
 (including
a
 mixture
 of
 academic
 and
 clinical
 centres
 to
 ensure
 generalizabil-
ity
 of
 DIAPHRAGM’s
 results).
 This
 may
 have
 differed
 to
 recruitment
from
 two
 tertiary
 pleural
 disease
 units
 (Oxford
 and
 Preston)
 in
the
 Hallifax
 study.
 Our
 design
 may
 have
 led
 to
 greater
 use
 of
‘non-optimised’
 CT
 including
 more
 use
 of
 CTPA
 and
 non-thoracic
radiology
 reporting,
 although
 these
 factors
 are
 not
 reported
 by
Hallifax
 et
 al.
 and
 cannot
 be
 directly
 compared.
We
 found
 that
 the
 sensitivity
 of
 CTPA
 (27%
 (95%
 CI
 9–53%))
 for
PM
 was
 significantly
 inferior
 to
 that
 of
 venous-phase
 CT
 (sensi-
tivity
 61%
 (95%
 CI
 53–68%),
 p
 =
 0.0056).
 The
 NPV
 of
 CTPA
 for
 PM
was
 only
 40%
 (95%
 CI
 20–63%).
 To
 our
 knowledge,
 this
 is
 the
 first
report
 to
 directly
 compare
 the
 diagnostic
 performance
 of
 arte-
rial
 phase
 CTPA
 to
 later-phase
 enhanced
 CT
 in
 the
 assessment
 of
PM.
 In
 a
 previous
 prospective
 study
 Hooper
 et
 al.
 performed
 CTPA
and
 late
 arterial
 phase
 CT
 (optimised
 for
 pleural
 imaging)
 in
 141
patients
 with
 suspected
 PM.
 However
 the
 primary
 objective
 of
 this
study
 was
 to
 assess
 the
 incidence
 of
 pulmonary
 emboli
 [7]
 and
the
 diagnostic
 performance
 of
 CTPA
 for
 PM
 was
 not
 reported.
 In
 a
small
 randomised
 study,
 Raj
 et
 al.
 previously
 demonstrated
 better
enhancement
 of
 the
 pleura
 utilising
 delayed
 phase
 (at
 60–90
 s
 post-
contrast)
 CT
 acquisition
 [8],
 Therefore
 venous-phase
 CT
 should
 be
requested
 in
 all
 patients
 with
 suspected
 PM,
 and
 this
 may
 have
been
 used
 more
 frequently
 in
 the
 Hallifax
 study.
 Our
 study
 clearly
demonstrates
 that
 this
 approach
 is
 frequently
 not
 taken
 in
 a
 more
generalizable
 population
 and
 may
 be
 even
 less
 frequently
 used
 than
reported
 here,
 since
 our
 centres
 did
 have
 a
 stated
 interest
 in
 pleu-
ral
 disease
 and
 were
 recruiting
 to
 DIAPHRAGM.
 A
 major
 reason
 for
this
 is
 the
 frequency
 of
 emergency
 presentation
 with
 suspected
 PM.
Previous
 Mesothelioma
 series
 have
 reported
 up
 to
 50%
 of
 cases
 pre-
senting
 in
 this
 manner
 [9,10]
 and
 this
 is
 corroborated
 here,
 with
 172
of
 the
 315
 patients
 (55%)
 presenting
 as
 an
 emergency
 to
 an
 acute
medical
 receiving
 unit.
 31/172
 (almost
 1
 in
 5)
 of
 these
 case
 had
 CT
performed
 as
 a
 CTPA
 to
 exclude
 concomitant
 pulmonary
 thrombo-
embolism,
 presumably
 driven
 by
 non-specifically
 high
 D-Dimer
results,
 although
 this
 was
 not
 specifically
 assessed
 here.
 Despite
the
 small
 numbers
 and
 resulting
 wide
 confidence
 intervals
 around
our
 results
 (particularly
 a
 sensitivity
 of
 27%
 (95%
 CI
 9–53%))
 the
 use
of
 CTPA
 for
 pleural
 diagnostics
 should
 be
 seriously
 questioned
 and
repeat
 imaging
 with
 optimised
 ‘pleural’
 contrast
 enhancement
 in
the
 venous
 phase
 should
 be
 considered
 where
 a
 positive
 result
 will
alter
 management.
The
 diagnostic
 sensitivity
 of
 CT
 was
 higher
 in
 the
 current
 study
when
 thoracic
 radiologists
 were
 involved
 in
 reporting
 (69%
 (95%
 CI
55–79%)
 vs.
 53%
 (95%
 CI
 44–62%)
 for
 non-thoracic
 radiology
 report-
ing,
 p
 =
 0.0488).
 Optimal
 imaging
 conditions
 (i.e.
 venous-phase
acquisition
 and
 thoracic
 radiology
 reporting)
 were
 associated
 with
a
 sensitivity
 of
 69%
 (95%
 CI
 56–80%),
 although
 the
 number
 of
patients
 imaged
 under
 sub-optimal
 conditions
 (i.e.
 CTPA
 reported
by
 non-thoracic
 radiologists)
 was
 too
 small
 (n
 =
 24)
 to
 allow
 a
meaningful
 comparison
 between
 these
 extremes.
 These
 data
 sug-
gest
 that
 increased
 specialist
 radiology
 reporting
 may
 improve
the
 performance
 of
 CT
 in
 the
 routine
 assessment
 of
 patients
 pre-
senting
 with
 PM.
 However,
 a
 limited
 workforce
 with
 job-plans
already
 committed
 to
 MDT
 provision
 and
 image-guided
 biopsy
services
 make
 this
 difficult
 to
 deliver.
 For
 example,
 in
 this
 study
 tho-
racic
 radiologists
 comprised
 only
 22%
 of
 the
 radiologists
 involved
and
 reported
 only
 37%
 of
 the
 scans.
 As
 a
 result,
 optimal
 imaging
conditions
 were
 only
 achieved
 in
 108/315
 (34%)
 of
 the
 patients
studied.
 The
 development
 of
 objective
 imaging
 biomarkers
 of
 PM
may
 therefore
 provide
 a
 better
 long-term
 method
 of
 reducing
inter-observer
 disagreement
 in
 CT
 reporting,
 as
 has
 previously
been
 demonstrated
 in
 breast
 cancer
 [11,12]
 Novel
 objective
 imag-
ing
 markers
 of
 PM
 are
 also
 under
 development
 including
 Pleural
Pointillism
 [13]
 and
 Early
 Contrast
 Enhancement
 [14],
 both
 defined
using
 MRI.
4.1.
 Study
 weaknesses
 and
 strengths
Although
 all
 patients
 included
 in
 this
 study
 were
 recruited
prospectively,
 the
 classification
 of
 each
 CT
 report
 as
 malignant
or
 benign
 was
 performed
 retrospectively.
 However,
 pre-specified
criteria
 were
 set
 in
 advance
 as
 to
 which
 terms
 would
 constitute
malignant
 and
 benign
 reports
 and
 these
 were
 used
 consistently.
The
 final
 pleural
 diagnosis
 end-point
 used
 in
 the
 study
 is
 likely
to
 be
 robust
 given
 the
 rigorous
 prospective
 assessment
 required
by
 the
 DIAPHRAGM
 study
 protocol.
 This
 included
 ready
 access
 to
thoracoscopy
 (and/or
 image-guided
 biopsy),
 a
 lung
 and
 regional
mesothelioma
 MDT
 review
 (where
 appropriate)
 and
 a
 specialist
pleural
 clinic
 follow-up
 for
 all
 cases.
 This
 was
 reflected
 in
 a
 high
cyto-histological
 confirmation
 rate
 of
 PM
 (90%).
 However,
 the
 min-
imum
 follow-up
 period
 required
 for
 inclusion
 in
 this
 current
 study
was
 only
 6
 months.
 Theoretically,
 this
 could
 result
 in
 an
 underes-
timation
 of
 the
 true
 Mesothelioma
 rate
 since
 it
 is
 normal
 practice
to
 follow
 up
 patients
 with
 Benign
 Asbestos
 Pleural
 Effusion
 (BAPE,

23/315
 (7%)
 of
 the
 patients
 studied)
 for
 at
 least
 2
 years,
 because
 of
 a
potential
 false
 negative
 pleural
 biopsy
 rate
 of
 up
 to
 12%
 in
 previous
case
 series.
 [15]
 However,
 all
 cases
 of
 BAPE
 were
 subject
 to
 manda-
tory
 clinical
 follow-up
 as
 per
 the
 DIAPHRAGM
 study
 protocol
 (see
Fig.
 1)
 and
 the
 mean
 follow-up
 for
 the
 patients
 diagnosed
 with
 BAPE
in
 this
 current
 study
 was
 367
 (SD
 220)
 days.
 Furthermore,
 it
 is
 not
clear
 whether
 Mesothelioma
 in
 follow-up
 represents
 a
 new
 diag-
nosis
 at
 that
 point
 or
 a
 genuine
 false
 negative
 based
 on
 the
 original
assessment.

 Conclusions
In
 clinical
 practice,
 CT
 plays
 a
 major
 role
 in
 the
 assessment
 of
patients
 with
 suspected
 pleural
 malignancy.
 The
 interpretation
 of
the
 CT
 scan
 by
 the
 referring
 clinician
 and
 the
 reporting
 radiolo-
gist
 frequently
 directs
 the
 patient
 towards,
 or
 away
 from
 further
diagnostics,
 including
 invasive
 pleural
 sampling.
 This
 is
 the
 sec-
ond
 study
 assessing
 the
 diagnostic
 performance
 of
 CT
 for
 pleural
malignancy
 in
 routine
 clinical
 practice,
 and
 demonstrates
 signif-
icantly
 lower
 sensitivity
 and
 specificity
 than
 previously
 reported
in
 smaller
 research
 studies.
 Given
 the
 NPV
 reported
 here
 (54%
(95%
 CI
 46–61%))
 it
 is
 important
 to
 consider
 invasive
 (cyto-
logical
 ±
 histological)
 sampling
 in
 patients
 where
 proven
 pleural
malignancy
 would
 alter
 management.
The
 low
 sensitivity
 and
 NPV
 of
 CTPA
 strongly
 suggest
 that
 this
modality
 is
 inadequate
 for
 the
 exclusion
 of
 PM.
 Either
 repeat
 CT
imaging
 with
 pleural
 contrast
 timing,
 alternative
 imaging
 (e.g.
magnetic
 resonance
 imaging)
 or
 further
 investigation
 if
 there
 are
other
 indicators
 of
 pleural
 malignancy
 should
 be
 considered
 after
a
 benign
 CTPA
 report.
 For
 patients
 with
 pleural
 effusion,
 revision
of
 existing
 guidelines
 advocating
 routine
 imaging
 of
 the
 thorax
 in
the
 arterial
 phase
 for
 oncological
 purposes
 [16]
 should
 be
 consid-
ered.
 Given
 the
 high
 level
 of
 skill
 required
 to
 interpret
 pleural
 CT
images,
 increased
 specialty
 reporting
 may
 immediately
 improve
the
 performance
 of
 CT
 in
 routine
 clinical
 practice.
 In
 addition,
 the
development
 of
 more
 objective
 imaging
 biomarkers
 of
 PM
 may
result
 in
 better
 performance
 by
 reducing
 operator
 dependence.
