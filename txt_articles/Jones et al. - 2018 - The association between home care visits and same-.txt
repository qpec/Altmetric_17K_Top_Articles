lder adults are more likely to use the emergency depart-
ment, have longer lengths of stay in the emergency 
department and are more likely to be admitted to hos-
pital from the emergency department than younger patents.1–3 
Despite being highly used by older adults, the emergency depart-
ment is often not the ideal place for seniors to receive care. Older 
adults are increasingly presenting to the emergency department 
with complex care needs that require greater assessment and 
coordination than the traditional disease-centric and episodic 
models of care typically permit.4–6
Increased access to publicly funded home and community 
care has been suggested as a way to reduce or prevent unneces-
sary or avoidable visits to the emergency department.7–9 How-
ever, evidence on the relation between home care and emergency 
department use is limited and mixed. Several clinical trials have 
tested enhanced models of home care and found no effect on 
emergency department use, whereas increased levels of home 
care service have been associated with a reduction in emergency 
department use in patients receiving palliative care.10–12
Within health systems, concerns persist that home care has 
evolved into a task-focused, visit-based, contracted service 
model that precludes comprehensive practice, and that this task-
based model contributes to silos of care.13 There have been calls 
to shift home care to a more comprehensive, team-based prac-
tice model that supports disease management in the home.10,13,14

ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: The extent to which 
home care visits contribute to the delay 
or avoidance of emergency department 
use is poorly characterized. We exam-
ined the association between home care 
visits and same-day emergency depart-
ment use among patients receiving pub-
licly funded home care.
METHODS: We conducted a population-
based case–crossover study among 
patients receiving publicly funded home 
care in the Hamilton–Niagara–Haldimand–
Brant region of Ontario between January 
and December 2015. Within individuals, all 
days with emergency department visits 
after 5 pm were selected as cases and 
matched with control days from the pre-
vious week. The cohort was stratified 
according to whether patients had 
on 
going home care needs (“long stay”) or 
short-term home care needs (“short 
stay”). We used conditional logistical 
regression to estimate the association 
between receiving a home care visit dur-
ing the day and visiting the emergency 
department after 5 pm on the same day.
RESULTS: A total of 4429 long-stay 
patients contributed 5893 emergency 
department visits, and 2836 short-stay 
patients contributed 3476 visits. Receiv-
ing a home care nursing visit was associ-
ated with an increased likelihood of visit-
ing the emergency department after 
5 pm on the same day in both long-stay 
(odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% confidence 
interval [CI] 1.17–1.48) and short-stay 
patients (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.07–1.39). 
Stronger associations were observed for 
less acute visits to the emergency depart-
ment. No associations were observed for 
other types of home care visits.
INTERPRETATION: Patients receiving 
home care were more likely to visit the 
emergency department during the eve-
ning on days they received a nursing visit. 
The mechanism of the association 
between home care visits and same-day 
emergency department use and the 
extent to which same-day emergency 
department visits could be prevented or 
diverted require additional investigation.

care visits and emergency department use may exist when home 
care clinicians have limited flexibility to act beyond a set of pre-
defined tasks during a visit or when they encounter clinical 
issues beyond the scope of their practice. If home care clinicians 
identify a clinical issue that they are unable to address during 
that visit, they may refer the patient to receive care elsewhere on 
the same day of the visit.
The objective of this study was to investigate the association 
between home care visits and same-day emergency department 
use among patients receiving publicly funded home care. We 
hypothesized that receiving nursing visits during the day would 
be associated with an increased likelihood of visiting the emer-
gency department during the evening hours of the same day. We 
hypothesized that there would be no association with other types 
of home care visits (e.g., personal support, physiotherapy and 
occupational therapy) given that their traditional scope of prac-
tice would make them less likely to detect acute medical issues.
Methods
Study design and data sources
We conducted a population-based case–crossover study among 
adult patients receiving home care within the Hamilton–
Niagara–Haldimand–Brant health region in Ontario. The health 
region includes more than 1.3 million people, accounting for 
roughly 11% of the population of Ontario, and has the largest 
number of adults older than 65 years in the province. The region 
contains more than 10 municipalities with wide variations in 
population density, socioeconomic status and access to care 
from tertiary centres. Ontario provides universal access to emer-
gency department and home care services via the publicly 
funded provincial health care system.
We used multiple linked population-based health administra-
tive databases. Home care records were obtained from the Client 
Health and Related Information System, which is the health 
administrative database used by Ontario’s publicly funded home 
care system.15 Information on emergency department visits and 
hospital stays were obtained from the National Ambulatory Care 
Reporting System and the Discharge Abstract Database, which 
contain standardized reporting for all emergency department 
visits and acute hospital admissions in Ontario, respectively.16,17 
The 3 databases are regularly checked for validity and have been 
used extensively in research.16–24
Regional versions of the administrative databases were 
accessed at the Health Data Library at McMaster University. 
Records were linked at the individual level using encrypted, 
unique identifiers. 
Participants
We constructed a population-based cohort of every day that 
each patient aged 19 years and older and receiving home care 
was eligible to receive service in the Ontario region between 
Jan. 1, 2015, and Dec. 31, 2015. Home care billing records were 
used to identify which home care services a patient received on 
each day, including nursing, personal support and therapies 
(physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language 
therapy, nutritional therapy and social work). The cohort was 
linked to emergency department records to identify any day 
that a patient visited the emergency department after 5 pm and 
to identify the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS)25 score, 
discharge disposition and primary diagnosis (International Sta-
tistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 
10th revision [ICD-10-CA])26 associated with the visit. In the rare 
case that a patient visited the emergency department twice 
after 5 pm on the same day, only the first visit was included. 
Days that a patient was admitted to hospital were excluded 
from the cohort.
We used existing administrative service categories to stratify 
the cohort into “long stay,” “short stay” and palliative groups 
(Appendix 1, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10. 
1503/cmaj.170892/-/DC1). Patients receiving palliative care were 
excluded from the cohort.
Statistical analysis
The case–crossover design matches an exposure period that pre-
cedes an event of interest with 1 or more control exposure per-
iods within the same subject.27 The design is appropriate for 
investigating the transient effects of an intermittent exposure on 
acute events.28 Through self-matching, the design eliminates 
confounding from any fixed patient-level factors.
Cases were defined as days that a member of our cohort of 
patients receiving home care visited the emergency department 
after 5 pm. The primary exposure measured was home care visits 
received on the same day as the emergency department visit. 
Control exposure periods were identified by selecting all days in 
the 7 days immediately preceding the case day that the patient 
did not visit the emergency department after 5 pm. Each day 
formed a separate matched control with exposure measured as 
the home care services that the patient received on that day. 
Matched sets of case and control days were analyzed with condi-
tional logistic regression.
The analysis was limited to emergency department visits 
after 5 pm to ensure that the emergency department visits 
occurred after any home care visits on that day, home care vis-
its in the evening being uncommon. Weekends and holidays 
were excluded from the selection of both cases and controls 
owing to varying exposure patterns and availability of other 
health care services on those days. Cases and control periods 
were selected separately for each type of home care service 
(nursing, therapies and personal support) with a requirement 
that the patient be actively authorized to receive the service. 
Patients could be authorized for all or none of the services on 
any day. Personal support was not studied in short-stay 
patients because they do not typically receive the service. 
Analy 
ses were stratified by patient group and performed sepa-
rately for each service type. In addition to the primary case defi-
nition of any emergency department visit after 5 pm, we also 
examined emergency department cases defined by discharge 
disposition (hospital admission v. non–hospital admission) and 
higher or lower acuity (CTAS score 1–3 v. 4–5). We examined 
effect modification by sex and self-reported health using the 
interaction term approach.

Some patients visited the emergency department after 5 pm on 
more than 1 day during the study period, creating depend 
encies 
between cases. To avoid violating independence assumptions, 
we adopted a within-cluster resampling analytic approach.29 
One case and 1 matched control day were randomly selected per 
patient, creating a set of independent matched pairs that was 
analyzed with conditional logistic regression. This process was 
repeated 10 000 times, resampling cases and control days with 
replacement. The ensemble of individual model results was com-
bined according to the method of Riegar and Weinberg29 to pro-
duce overall estimates of the model parameters and associated 
variances. All statistical tests were 2-tailed, and p < 0.05 was set 
as the significance level.
Sensitivity analysis
We performed a sensitivity analysis to examine the robustness of 
the results to changes in elements of the study design. We con-
ducted the analysis using 4 pm and 6 pm rather than 5 pm as the 
threshold for capturing emergency department visits. We also 
explored the effects of selecting control periods from the 5 days, 
3 days or 1 day immediately preceding the case day rather than 
the 7 days used in the primary analysis.
Ethics approval
We received ethics approval from the Hamilton Integrated 
Research Ethics Board, which is affiliated with McMaster University, 
St. Joseph’s Healthcare Hamilton and Hamilton Health Sciences.
Results
The cohort contained 30 253 long-stay and 35 097 short-stay 
patients receiving home care. A total of 4429 unique long-stay 
patients contributed 5893 emergency department visits to the 
case–crossover analysis, and 2836 unique short-stay patients 
contributed 3476 visits. The characteristics of patients contribut-
ing cases to the analysis can be found in Table 1. Long-stay 
patients were largely frail older adults with multiple chronic con-
ditions, functional impairments and ongoing home support 
needs. Short-stay patients tended to be younger, post–acute 
care patients with short-term care needs, such as wound care, 
intravenous medication administration or rehabilitation. Clinical 
assessment data were available for only 3958 (89.4%) long-stay 
patients and 2676 (94.4%) short-stay patients because some 
patients were discharged before a clinical assessment was com-
pleted (e.g., death or hospital admission). Long-stay patients had 
a median age of 81 years, and 61.6% were female. Short-stay 
patients were younger, with a median age of 66, and had a slight 
preponderance of women (51.6%). 
The number of cases available for analysis varied by the home 
care service examined, because patients had to be actively 
authorized to receive the service for a day to be included as a 
case. A matrix of the total cases and controls and exposed cases 
and controls by emergency department visit by outcome and 
type of home care service can be found in Table 2. 
Home care nursing visits were significantly associated with a 
greater likelihood of same-day emergency department visits 
after 5 pm in both long-stay (odds ratio [OR] 1.32, 95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 1.17–1.48) and short-stay patients (OR 1.22, 
95% CI 1.07–1.39) (Figure 1). In both patient groups, the effect 
was stronger in visits to the emergency department that did not

result in a hospital admission (long stay: OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.29–
1.76; short stay: OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.11–1.52). The effect was also 
stronger in emergency department visits with a CTAS score of 4 
or 5 in the long-stay patient group (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.20–2.21).
The association between home care nursing visits and emer-
gency department visits was not significant when emergency 
department visits were restricted to those that resulted in a hos-
pital admission. There were also no significant associations 
between any type of emergency department visit and home care 
therapies or personal support visits. 
Primary diagnoses for emergency department visits that 
occurred on the same day as home care nursing visits were broad, 
with the top 10 diagnoses accounting for only 31.37% of all diag-
noses among long-stay patients and 37.78% among short-stay 
patients (Appendix 2, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170892/-/DC1). There was no consistent, appre-
ciable effect modification by sex or self-reported health (Appendi-
ces 3 and 4, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/
cmaj.170892/-/DC1).
Sensitivity analysis
Using a threshold of 4 pm or 6 pm rather than 5 pm for emer-
gency department visits did not have a meaningful effect on the 
results (Appendix 5, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/
doi:10.1503/cmaj.170892/-/DC1). The odds ratios between nurs-
ing visits and emergency department visits produced using the 
6 pm threshold tended to be slightly smaller than those from the 
5 pm threshold, which is in line with expectations that a tran-
sient association would attenuate over time. Selecting control 
exposures from the 5 days, 3 days or 1 day immediately preced-
ing the case day yielded similar results to using 7 days (Appendix 
6, available at www.cmaj.ca/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1503/cmaj. 
170892/-/DC1).
Interpretation
Receiving home care nursing visits during the day was associ-
ated with an increased likelihood of visiting the emergency 
department between 5 pm and midnight of the same day. Stron-
ger associations were observed for emergency department visits 
that did not result in a hospital admission and for visits with a 
CTAS score of 4 or 5 among long-stay patients. 
This study examined the transient effect of home care visits 
on emergency department use, considering only emergency 
department visits that occurred on the same day as a home care 
visit. Accordingly, our results cannot be compared with studies 
that looked at emergency department use over periods of weeks 
and months. The results of the study supported our hypothesis 
that home care nursing would be associated with a higher likeli-
hood of same-day emergency department use. An emergency 
department visit is not necessarily a negative outcome, but may 
be if patients could more appropriately receive treatment in the

community setting by their usual providers. Although it is diffi-
cult to determine the appropriateness of an emergency depart-
ment visit from administrative data, the stronger associations 
noted for non–hospital admission and less acute emergency 
department visits suggests that some patients likely could have 
received treatment in less acute settings.
Our findings correspond with previous reports on the chal-
lenges of nursing care in the community, such as limited time 
and the lack of direct management of clinical problems.30 Cur-
rently, care and monitoring outside of the home care visits is 
predominantly assumed by the patient and family, who would

hospital admissions.21 The involvement of more nurse practi-
tioners in home care or on-call primary care could address some 
of the acute needs that would otherwise result in an emergency 
department visit. Additionally, the current model of care for 
patients not receiving palliative care (nearly all) does not oper-
ate with full integration of primary care. Home care staff and 
patients may have no viable option other than to proceed to the 
emergency department, because there are limited mechanisms 
in place for timely access to diagnostics and physician support 
to address or consult on emergent problems. Better integration 
with primary care may also support greater continuity of care, 
which has been associated with lower emergency department 
use.31,32
Our findings support the need for further investigation into 
the reason or reasons that home care nursing visits are associ-
ated with a higher likelihood of same-day emergency depart-
ment visits and into the appropriateness of these visits. Experi-
mental studies are needed to test the cost-effectiveness of home 
and primary care models that support safe and timely access to 
community-based care when nonurgent clinical issues arise.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, given that the case–
crossover design examines only cases, only patients who visited 
the emergency department after 5 pm contributed to the analy-
sis. Also, the data sources used in this study contained the billing 
records for all publicly funded home care in the region, but no 
information on privately funded home care that a patient may 
have been receiving at the same time. Finally, the use of regional 
data prevents the capture of emergency department visits by 
patients who resided in the region but went to the emergency 
department in another region. However, our analyses suggest 
that potential confounding was rare and would only serve to 
make our results more conservative.
Conclusion
We found that patients receiving home care were more likely to 
visit the emergency department during the evening on days that 
they received a home care nursing visit. The association trended 
stronger for emergency department visits that did not result in a 
hospital admission and for lower-acuity visits among patients 
with ongoing care needs. Future work should continue to explore 
the mechanisms by which home care nursing visits are associated 
with emergency department use and other outcomes, incorporat-
ing additional effect modifiers, such as primary care access.
