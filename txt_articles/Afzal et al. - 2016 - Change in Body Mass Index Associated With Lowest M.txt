IMPORTANCE Research has shown a U-shaped pattern in the association of body mass index
(BMI) with mortality. Although average BMI has increased over time in most countries, the
prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors may also be decreasing among obese individuals
over time. Thus, the BMI associated with lowest all-cause mortality may have changed.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether the BMI value that is associated with the lowest all-cause
mortality has increased in the general population over a period of 3 decades.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Three cohorts from the same general population
enrolled at different times: the Copenhagen City Heart Study in 1976-1978 (n = 13 704) and
1991-1994 (n = 9482) and the Copenhagen General Population Study in 2003-2013
(n = 97 362). All participants were followed up from inclusion in the studies to November
2014, emigration, or death, whichever came first.
EXPOSURES For observational studies, BMI was modeled using splines and in categories
defined by the World Health Organization. Body mass index was calculated as weight in
kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Main outcome was all-cause mortality and secondary
outcomes were cause-specific mortality.
RESULTS The number of deaths during follow-up was 10 624 in the 1976-1978 cohort (78%
cumulative mortality; mortality rate [MR], 30/1000 person-years [95% CI, 20-46]), 5025 in
the 1991-1994 cohort (53%; MR, 16/1000 person-years [95% CI, 9-30]), and 5580 in the
2003-2013 cohort (6%; MR, 4/1000 person-years [95% CI, 1-10]). Except for cancer
mortality, the association of BMI with all-cause, cardiovascular, and other mortality was
curvilinear (U-shaped). The BMI associated with the lowest all-cause mortality increased by
3.3 from the 1976-1978 cohort compared with the 2003-2013 cohort.

The multivariable- adjusted hazard ratios for all-cause mortality for BMI of 30 or more vs BMI
of 18.5 to 24.9 were 1.31 (95% CI, 1.23-1.39; MR, 46/1000 person-years [95% CI, 32-66] vs
28/1000 person-years [95% CI, 18-45]) in the 1976-1978 cohort, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.04-1.22;
MR, 28/1000 person-years [95% CI, 17-47] vs 15/1000 person-years [95% CI, 7-31]) in the
1991-1994 cohort, and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.92-1.07; MR, 5/1000 person-years [95% CI, 2-12] vs
4/1000 person-years [95% CI, 1-11]) in the 2003-2013 cohort.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among 3 Danish cohorts, the BMI associated with the lowest
all-cause mortality increased by 3.3 from cohorts enrolled from 1976-1978 through
2003-2013. Further investigation is needed to understand the reason for this change
and its implications.

T
he controversy about determining the body mass index
(BMI) that is associated with lowest all-cause mortality
hasbeenfuelledbydifferencesinanalyticalapproaches.1-3
Depending on how the exposure is defined or which popula-
tions or subgroups are analyzed, it is possible to estimate dif-
ferent BMI values to be associated with lowest all-cause
mortality.4-11TheU-shapedpatternoftheassociationofBMIwith
mortality has been a point of contention; the increased risk of
mortality observed with BMI in the low normal range has been
suggestedtobecausedbyresidualconfoundingduetoconcur-
rentdiseaseordeclineinBMIduetodisease,1whileothershave
suggested this is caused by a detrimental effect of low BMI.2,3
However,whethertheassociationhaschangedovertimeinthe
general population has not been addressed adequately. Previ-
ousfindingsindicatethatwhileaverageBMIhasincreasedover
timeinmostcountries,theprevalenceofcardiovascularriskfac-
tors may be decreasing among obese individuals over time.12
Thus, the BMI associated with lowest all-cause mortality may
have changed over time. The few studies addressing this ques-
tionhaveusedsubgroupsfromdifferentlyrecruitedcohortswith
limited or incomplete follow-up, with conflicting results mak-
ing firm conclusions difficult.13,14
In this study, the hypothesis that the BMI value associ-
ated with the lowest all-cause mortality has increased in the
general population over a period of 3 decades was tested. If
this was the case, a corresponding decrease in the risk of all-
cause mortality among overweight and obese individuals
should be observed during this period. For this purpose, 3
cohorts from the white Danish general population recruited
in 1976-1978, 1991-1994, and 2003-2013 were analyzed.
Methods
Participants
TheCopenhagenCityHeartStudy(CCHS)wasinitiatedin1976-
1978 and was also sampled 15 years later in 1991-1994. Indi-
viduals aged 20 to 100 years were randomly invited from the
national Danish Civil Registration System to reflect the Danish
general population.15,16
The Copenhagen General Population Study (CGPS) was
sampled in 2003-2013, and participants were recruited as for
the CCHS. Individuals aged 20 to 100 years were randomly in-
vited from the national Danish Civil Registration System to re-
flect the Danish general population.15,16 None of the individu-
als had attended the CCHS.
The studies were approved by institutional review boards
andDanishethicalcommittees,andparticipantsprovidedwrit-
ten informed consent. All individuals were white of Danish de-
scent as determined by the Danish Civil Registration System;
that is, the participants and both parents were Danish citi-
zens and were born in Denmark.17
BMI, Waist Circumference, and Waist-Hip Ratio
Measurements were completed by trained staff at 1 clinic cen-
ter. Weight was measured without shoes and in light clothing
to the nearest 0.1 kg on professional scales. Height was mea-
sured to the nearest 0.1 cm with a stadiometer.
Waist circumference was measured midway between the
lowestedgeoftheribcageandthehighestedgeoftheiliaccrest,
whereas hip circumference was measured at the widest point
between the iliac crest and symphysis pubis. Waist-hip ratio
was calculated as waist circumference divided by hip circum-
ference. Waist-hip ratio was only available in the CCHS 1991-
1994 and CGPS 2003-2013 examinations.
Potential Confounders
Confounders were chosen based on the World Health Organi-
zation (WHO) global health status report evaluating the most
common risk factors for all-cause mortality and their possible
association with BMI.18 Diabetes, hypertension, and history
of cardiovascular disease were deliberately excluded as
potential confounders as they would act in the causal path-
way between obesity and mortality.15,19-22 That is, potential
confounders were selected a priori based on what has been
shown to be associated with mortality and obesity, but vari-
ables thought to lie in the causal pathway between obesity
and mortality were excluded. Participants filled in a ques-
tionnaire on smoking status (never, former, or current),
tobacco consumption (number of cigarettes per day), alcohol
consumption (type and amount per week), intensity of
leisure-time physical activity during a week (<2 hours, 2-4
hours of light physical activity, >4 hours of activity or 2-4
hours of intense activity, and >4 hours of intense activity),
and level of income (high, medium, and low using cohort-
specific categories), reviewed together with an investigator
on the day of attendance. Cumulative tobacco consumption
was calculated for former and current smokers in pack-years;
a pack-year was defined as 20 cigarettes or equivalent per
day for a year. Standard hospital assays were used to measure
plasma cholesterol. History of cardiovascular disease or can-
cer was used in stratified analyses and was defined as history
of ischemic heart disease, stroke, and any cancer except for
nonmelanoma skin cancer according to national registries, as
done previously.16,23
End Points
The 100% complete Danish Civil Registration System records
the date of death for all persons living in Denmark, while the
national Danish Causes of Death Registry records ranked
main causes of death as well as contributing causes of death,
as reported by the attending physician in general practice, by
the attending physician at a hospital, or by a physician in a
forensic or pathology department. Analyzing the accuracy of
the Danish Causes of Death Registry for individual end points
has only been performed for selected diagnoses; for example,
for fatal myocardial infarction, the positive predictive value is
70% and the sensitivity is 89%,24 and for neoplastic diseases,
the positive predictive value is 92% and the sensitivity is
85%.25 Causes of death were classified according to the Inter-
national Classification of Diseases, Eighth Revision or Tenth
Revision (ICD-8 or ICD-10), as done previously26: cancer
death was considered present if 1 of the top 3 ranked causes
of death was a cancer diagnosis (ICD-8 codes 140-209, ICD-10
codes C00-C97); remaining deaths were classified as cardio-
vascular death if 1 of the top 3 ranked causes of death had a

cardiovascular disease diagnosis (ICD-8 codes 390-458,
ICD-10 codes I00-I99); and all other deaths were classified as
other death. Alternative analyses using the underlying cause
of death only showed similar results; thus, for simplicity only
1 end point definition was included. The national Danish
Causes of Death Registry (end of follow-up, December 2012)
lags the Danish Civil Registration System (end of follow-up,
November 2014) by almost 2 years, so some deaths could not
be classified by cause (1976-1978: 404 deaths, 1991-1994: 377,
2003-2013: 1870).
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were carried out using Stata/SE version 13.1, and
2-sided P values <.05 were considered statistically signifi-
cant. In the cohorts, the data were 99.6% complete in rela-
tion to potential confounders; the missing data were im-
puted using multivariable chained imputation (mi impute
chained) with fully conditional specification. However, with-
out the imputations, results were similar to those presented.
Cox proportional hazards regression was used to esti-
mate hazard ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the as-
sociation between BMI and mortality end points, and age was
used as time scale with delayed entry (left truncation). Thus,
age differences were automatically adjusted for, and analy-
ses are referred to in text, tables, and figures as age adjusted.
MultivariableCoxregressionwasadjustedforage,yearofbirth,
sex, smoking status, cumulative tobacco consumption, alco-
hol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, income, and
plasma cholesterol. The proportional hazards assumption was
assessed in Cox regression models graphically by plotting
−ln[−ln(survival)] vs ln(analysis time) and evaluation of scaled
residuals with no major violations observed. The relation-
ships were evaluated with the use of restricted cubic splines.27
The number of knots, between 3 and 7, was chosen according
to 2 criteria to balance best fit and overfitting: (1) best fit: low-
est value of Akaike information criteria28 and (2) parsimony:
if Akaike information criteria were within 2 of each other for
different knots, the lowest number of knots was chosen.
Follow-up time for each participant began at the day of exami-
nation and ended at death, emigration (1976-1978: 53, 1991-
1994: 80, 2003-2013: 380), or November 2014, whichever oc-
curredfirst.Age-adjustedmortalityrateswerecalculatedusing
Poissonregressionmodelsstratifiedby10-yearagegroupsfrom
20 to 80 years, and individuals older than 80 years were com-
bined into 1 group. To derive an aggregated estimate of mor-
tality rate, estimates were combined using a meta-analytic ap-
proach with random effects as each age group was expected
to have a different underlying mortality rate.29
The BMI that was associated with lowest mortality was the
BMI with the lowest hazard ratio in each cohort; 95% confi-
dence intervals for these estimates were derived using non-
parametric bootstrap estimation with 5000 replications.30 Ad-
ditional analyses were conducted using WHO categories, with
BMI less than 18.5 as underweight, BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 as nor-
mal weight, BMI of 25.0 to 29.9 as overweight, and BMI of 30
or more as obese.
Note that due to overlap of participants between CCHS
1976-1978 and 1991-1994, standard techniques for compar-
ing the estimates could not be used directly. Thus, estimates
were compared from each CCHS cohort with CGPS 2003-
2013 separately.
Results
The cohorts consisted of 13 704 individuals with BMI mea-
surements from the 1976-1978 cohort (participation rate,
74%; 6329 men and 7375 women), 9482 with BMI from the
1991-1994 cohort (participation rate, 61%; 4164 men and
5318 women), and 97 362 individuals with BMI measure-
ments from the 2003-2013 cohort (participation rate, 43%;
43 783 men and 53 579 women). Of these, 6793 attended
both the 1976-1978 cohort and the 1991-1994 cohort. Across
the 3 cohorts, tobacco consumption decreased, whereas
alcohol consumption, physical activity, and income
increased from 1976-1978 to 2003-2013 (Table). The number
of deaths during follow-up was 10 624 (78% cumulative mor-
tality; mortality rate [MR], 30/1000 person-years [95% CI,
20-46]) in the 1976-1978 cohort, 5025 (53%; MR, 16/1000
person-years [95% CI, 9-30]) in 1991-1994, and 5580 (6%;
MR, 4/1000 person-years [95% CI, 1-10]) in 2003-2013. With
follow-up restricted to 9 years, the MR was 13/1000 person-
years (95% CI, 6-28) in 1976-1978, 13/1000 person-years
(95% CI, 6-25) in 1991-1994, and 4/1000 person-years (95%
CI, 1-10) in 2003-2013. Among those who died, the median
age at death was 77 years in the 1976-1978 cohort, 81 years in
the 1991-1994 cohort, and 79 years in the 2003-2013 cohort,
whereas median follow-up was 19.8 years, 11.0 years, and
4.6 years, respectively.
BMI and the Lowest Mortality
There was a nonlinear association of BMI with all-cause mor-
tality in all 3 cohorts as both high and low BMI were associ-
ated with high all-cause mortality. However, the BMI associ-
ated with the lowest mortality increased over 3 decades
(Figure 1). The association of BMI with cardiovascular mortal-
ity and other mortality showed a similar pattern (Figure 2);
however, the association with cancer mortality was not
U-shaped, and the BMI associated with the lowest mortality
could not be determined.
TheBMIassociatedwiththelowestall-causemortalitywas
23.7 (95% CI, 23.4-24.3) in 1976-1978, 24.6 (95% CI, 24.0-
26.3) in 1991-1994, and 27.0 (95% CI, 26.5-27.6) in 2003-2013
(Figure 1). The corresponding BMI estimates for cardiovascu-
lar mortality were 23.2 (95% CI, 22.6-23.7), 24.0 (95% CI, 23.4-
25.0), and 26.4 (95% CI, 24.1-27.4), respectively, and for other
mortality,24.1(95%CI,23.5-25.9),26.8(95%CI,26.1-27.9),and
27.8 (95% CI, 27.1-29.6), respectively (Figure 2).
To assess follow-up–dependent changes in the BMI asso-
ciated with the lowest mortality, the estimates from 2 years of
follow-up to maximum follow-up were plotted for the 1976-
1978 and 2003-2013 cohorts (Figure 3). Graphically, there was
no evidence of convergence or a follow-up–dependent influ-
ence on the estimates, indicating that the BMI associated with
the lowest mortality was consistently different between the
2 cohorts.

BMI in Categories and Mortality
Using WHO categories of BMI, with BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 as the
reference, showed corresponding results: the risk of all-
cause mortality was reduced from 1976-1978 through 1991-
1994 to 2003-2013 for both BMI of 25 to 29.9 and BMI of 30 or
greater (Figure 4). However, the multivariable-adjusted haz-
ardratiosforBMIlessthan18.5vsBMIof18.5to24.9weresimi-
lar across all 3 time periods. The multivariable-adjusted haz-
ard ratios for all-cause mortality for BMI of 25 to 29.9 vs BMI
of 18.5 to 24.9 were 1.04 (95% CI, 0.99-1.08; MR, 35/1000
person-years [95% CI, 24-51] vs 28/1000 person-years [95% CI,
18-45]) in the 1976-1978 cohort, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.91-1.04; MR,
22/1000 person-years [95% CI, 12-39] vs 15/1000 person-
years [95% CI, 7-31]) in the 1991-1994 cohort, and 0.86 (95%
CI, 0.82-0.92; MR, 4/1000 person-years [95% CI, 1-10] vs
4/1000 person-years [95% CI, 1-11]) in the 2003-2013 cohort.
ThecorrespondinghazardratiosforBMIof30orgreatervsBMI

in the 1976-1978 cohort, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.04-1.22; MR, 28/1000

5/1000 person-years [95% CI, 2-12] vs 4/1000 person-years
[95% CI, 1-11]) in the 2003-2013 cohort.
The association between BMI and mortality is suscep-
tible to confounding by age, sex, smoking, and presence of car-
diovascular disease or cancer, and therefore the analyses were
repeated stratified by these variables. Stratified analyses
showed a similar pattern as in the main analyses; that is, the
riskofall-causemortalitywasreducedfrom1976-1978through
1991-1994 to 2003-2013 for BMI of 25 to 29.9 and BMI of 30 or
greater (eFigure 1 in the Supplement).

Sensitivity Analyses
Analyses restricted to never-smokers without a history of car-
diovascular disease or cancer showed different patterns in the
3 time periods, from an almost linearly increasing risk of all-
cause mortality with increasing BMI in the 1976-1978 cohort
to a U-shaped pattern in the 2003-2013 cohort (BMI associ-
ated with the lowest mortality, 26.1), with an intermediate pat-
terninthe1991-1994cohort(eFigure2intheSupplement).The
BMI associated with the lowest mortality in the 1976-1978 co-
hort was the lowest BMI value on the plot, that is, approxi-
mately 18, as the association was linear, while in the 1991-
1994 cohort the 95% confidence intervals for hazard ratios
overlapped 1 in almost the entire range of BMI values. In analy-
ses stratified by age, ie, 60 years and younger and older than
60 years, the BMI associated with the lowest mortality was
higherinthe2003-2013cohort(≤60years:26.7,>60years:27.3)

Solid lines are multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios, and dashed lines indicate
95% confidence intervals derived from restricted cubic spline regression
with knots chosen by Akaike information criterion as described in Methods.
A body mass index (BMI) of 25 was used as the reference (calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). There is no BMI data marker
and error bar for cancer mortality because the 95% confidence intervals
for the hazard ratios overlap almost the entire upper range of BMI in all 3
cohorts. The graphs are truncated at the 1st and 99th percentiles. The Cox
regression was adjusted for age, sex, smoking status, cumulative tobacco
consumption, alcohol consumption, leisure-time physical activity, income,
and plasma cholesterol level.

compared with the 1976-1978 cohort (≤60 years: 23.5, >60
years: 24.4) (eFigure 3 in the Supplement).
In analyses where estimates were plotted according to
follow-up, the estimates for the 1976-1978 cohort were paral-
lel to the estimates for the 2003-2013 cohort for the same
length of follow-up for BMI of 25 to 29.9 vs BMI of 18.5 to
24.9 and BMI 30 or greater vs BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 (eFigure 4 in
the Supplement). However, for BMI of 30 or greater vs BMI of
18.5 to 24.9, estimates increased with increasing length
of follow-up.
The distribution of BMI, waist-hip ratio, and waist circum-
ferencewasdifferentbetweenthecohortswithhigherBMIand
waist circumference in 2003-2013, but lower waist-hip ratio
for men (eFigure 5 in the Supplement). Mean height in-
creased across the 3 cohorts; therefore, height-adjusted analy-
ses were carried out; the results were similar to height-
unadjusted analyses (eFigure 6 in the Supplement vs Figure 4).
Also, analyses adjusted for hypertension, diabetes, and his-
tory of cardiovascular disease were carried out; however, the
results were similar to the unadjusted analyses (Figure 1 vs
eFigure 7 in the Supplement).
Discussion
The BMI value associated with the lowest all-cause mortality
has increased by 3.3 over 3 decades from 1976-1978 to 2003-
2013.Furthermore,thehazardratioforall-causemortalitythat
was associated with BMI of 30 or greater vs BMI of 18.5 to 24.9
decreased from 1.3 to 1.0 over this 30-year period. These lat-
terfindingswererobustinanalysesstratifiedbyage,sex,smok-
ing status, and history of cardiovascular disease or cancer.
Usually, the controversy over the different observed as-
sociationsbetweenBMIandmortalityhasbeenascribedtohow
studies handle confounding by age, sex, smoking status, and
baseline disease.1-11 However, analyses stratified for these vari-
ables did not explain the observed secular trend. Although, the
pattern changed from linear to U shaped among never-
smokers, this finding is compatible with the interpretation that
the BMI associated with the lowest mortality has increased
as the BMI associated with lowest mortality increased from ap-
proximately 18 in the 1976-1978 cohort to approximately 26
in the 2003-2013 cohort. A potential explanation for the secu-
lar trend may be that while improved treatment for cardiovas-
cular risk factors or complicating diseases has reduced mor-
tality in all weight classes, the effects may have been greater
at higher BMI levels than at lower BMI levels.12 Because obe-
sity is a causal risk factor for hypertension, diabetes, cardio-
vascular disease, and dyslipidemia,15,19-22 obese individuals

Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters squared and categorized using World Health Organization criteria.
Estimates were derived using Cox regression adjusted for age, sex,
smoking status, cumulative tobacco consumption, alcohol consumption,
leisure-time physical activity, income, and plasma cholesterol level. P values
are for comparison of the 1976-1978 and 1991-1994 estimates with the
2003-2013 estimate.

may have had a higher selective decrease in mortality.18 Indi-
rect evidence of this effect is seen in the findings as the deaths
occur at similar time periods in the 3 cohorts, but cohorts re-
cruited at later periods have an increase in the BMI associ-
ated with the lowest mortality, possibly suggesting a period ef-
fect related to changes in clinical practice, such as improved
treatments, or general public health status, such as de-
creased smoking or increased physical activity. Treatment ef-
fects and public health changes could not be tested directly in
these cohorts, but a similar secular trend has been noted in
othercohorts.13,31,32AsthestandardWHOcategorieswereused
across all 3 cohorts to better compare the cohorts both within
this study and with other studies, the differences cannot be
attributed to different categorizations of BMI.6,33 Further-
more, a lower mortality rate with a higher percentage surviv-
ing to older age could change the BMI associated with the low-
est mortality as suggested in a recent meta-analysis.10 In the
present data, the difference is 1 unit or less in BMI associated
withthelowestmortalityforageolderthan60yearsvs60years
or younger in all 3 cohorts, indicating that this is only a partial
explanation.
Another interesting finding in this study is that the opti-
mal BMI in relation to mortality is placed in the overweight cat-
egory in the most recent 2003-2013 cohort. This finding was
consistent in both the whole population sample (optimal BMI,
27) and in a subgroup of never-smokers without history of car-
diovascular disease or cancer (optimal BMI, 26.1). If this find-
ing is confirmed in other studies, it would indicate a need to
revise the WHO categories presently used to define over-
weight, which are based on data from before the 1990s.34
This study has several strengths. First, the 3 samples from
the Danish general population were drawn from the same
population in Copenhagen, varying only with regard to time
of recruitment. Second, the assessment and registration of co-
variates was almost identical in the 3 cohorts. Third, there was
complete follow-up; that is, every single individual could be
followed up to end of follow-up, death, or emigration. Fourth,
relevant confounders had been registered, allowing for sen-
sitivity analyses to explore the secular trends in the associa-
tion of BMI with all-cause mortality in detail, to exclude that
the differences were due to obvious confounders.
Potential limitations of this study include that there was
different follow-up time in the 3 cohorts. Sensitivity analyses
indicatedthatthedifferencesbetweenthe1976-1978and2003-
2013 cohorts could not be explained by different follow-up
time. Another limitation is that the 1976-1978 and 1991-1994
cohorts overlapped, which could raise concern regarding sur-
vivor selection bias in the latter cohort beyond that normally
observed in studies of the general population. However, com-
parison of the 1976-1978 and 2003-2013 cohorts alone would
give similar conclusions. Furthermore, the 1991-1994 cohort
was supplemented with younger participants at recruitment
to counter this bias. In addition, only white Danes were in-
cluded, possibly restricting generalizability of the results to
other ethnicities and countries with other health care set-
tings. However, we are not aware of data to suggest that the
present findings would not be applicable to most ethnicities
in developed countries. The participation rate was lower in the
2003-2013 cohort compared with the older cohorts, which
could indicate a greater risk of healthy participant bias com-
pared with the older cohorts. However, for this to be a viable
source of bias, a selective participation of healthier individu-
als in the overweight and obese groups compared with the nor-
mal weight group should be observed. Nevertheless, overall
mortality statistics indicate that the 2003-2013 cohort is com-
parable with the overall Danish population: the crude mortal-
ityrateinDenmarkwas9per1000person-years(51 340deaths;
population, 5.6 million) in 2014, and the causes of death were
cardiovascular in 23% and cancer in 30% of cases.35 In the
2003-2013 cohort, the crude mortality rate was 9 per 1000
person-years, and causes of death were cardiovascular in 26%
and cancer in 41% of cases. Using self-reported data, the Dan-
ish Health Authority has estimated that 47% of the popula-
tion has a BMI of 25 or greater; the corresponding proportion
was 56% in the 2003-2013 cohort.36 Also, a limitation is that
the question of causality cannot be addressed in an observa-
tional study, ie, whether the causal association between BMI
and all-cause mortality has changed over time.
Conclusions
Among 3 Danish cohorts, the BMI associated with the lowest
all-cause mortality increased by 3.3 from 1976-1978 through
2003-2013. Further investigation is needed to understand the
reason for this change and its implications.
