in protein content

Abstract
Background: The macronutrient composition of the diet may play a more important role in maintaining a healthy
body weight and preventing obesity than previously thought. The primary goal of this research was to determine
the extent to which the simple addition of a small serving of a sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) to meals with
different macronutrient compositions impacts appetite, energy metabolism and substrate oxidation.
Methods: Appetite, energy metabolism and substrate oxidation were measured in 27 healthy weight adults
(age = 23 ± 5 y; BMI = 23 ± 2 kg/m2) on two occasions in a room calorimeter after consuming a SSB or a non-nutritive-
sweetened beverage (NNSB) with a standard (15%E) or high- (30%E) protein meal. Meal carbohydrate (CHO) content
was adjusted to maintain equivalent calories for both study visits. All meals were composed of the same foods and
provided 17 g of fat and 500 non-beverage calories. Study visits were separated by at least 1 week and menstruating
females were studied during the luteal phase (Days 15–20). The effects of sex, protein level and beverage type and
their interactions on satiety, appetite for foods with specific taste profiles, diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) and rates
of substrate oxidation were assessed using a 3-way Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance.
Results: Increasing dietary protein decreased hunger and increased satiety. Males were hungrier and less satisfied with
the meals than females. Increasing dietary protein also decreased the desire to eat something savory, salty and fatty
and the males had a greater appetite for food with these taste profiles. Interestingly, there was no effect of sex, dietary
protein or beverage type on the desire to eat something sweet. The inclusion of a SSB markedly suppressed DIT
(2.42% ± 5.91%) and fat oxidation (9.87 ± 11.09 g).
Conclusion: Appetite sensations, food preferences, energy expenditure and substrate oxidation are significantly altered
in response to changes in meal macronutrient composition produced by modifications in the protein content of a
meal and consumption of a SSB. Most notably, consumption of a SSB during a meal markedly reduces energy
efficiency and fat oxidation independent of macronutrient composition.

 Background
Obesity is an increasing problem, both in the United
States and globally. Evidence suggests that changes in
the macronutrient composition of a diet may play a
more dynamic role in sustaining energy balance than
simply counting calories. Concomitant with the in-
creased prevalence of obesity, there has been a shift in
the macronutrient composition of the American diet. In
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1
(NHANES I, 1971–1974), the percentage of energy
intake (%E) from carbohydrates was reported to be
44%E, protein 17%E and fat 37%E [1]. By NHANES
2013–2014, carbohydrates had increased to 49%E while
protein and fat decreased to 16%E and 33%E, respect-
ively [2]. This change in the macronutrient composition
of the American diet has increased total energy intake
by approximately 984 kJ per day [1, 2].
Indeed, the substitution of one macronutrient, particu-
larly protein, for another can markedly affect both sides
of the energy balance equation [1, 3]. On the expend-
iture side, studies of human bioenergetics have consist-
ently reported that increasing dietary protein while
maintaining energy intake produces a greater and more
prolonged
thermic
effect
and
greater
total
energy
expenditure [4]. Furthermore, dietary protein intake
potentially increases fat oxidation by up to 50% [5]. On
the intake side, protein intake may be regulated in that
decreasing protein consumption stimulates an increase
in energy intake in an attempt to maintain a constant
absolute intake of dietary protein [1, 6, 7]. A 1.5%E
decrease in dietary protein intake increases energy intake
from carbohydrates and fats by 14%, perhaps in an at-
tempt to increase protein intake from less protein-rich
food sources [7]. In a 4-day in-patient ad libitum cross-
over feeding trial, a 5%E decrease in dietary protein in-
take produced a 12% increase in total energy intake [8].
The authors calculated that this was equivalent to a
4.5 kJ increase in non-protein foods for every 1 kJ de-
crease in habitual protein intake. Alternatively, a 1%E in-
crease in dietary protein intake corresponded to ca 130
– 226 kJ decrease in daily energy intake dependent upon
weight status and macronutrient substitution [1]. There-
fore, the shift in the American diet towards greater
carbohydrate intake and reduced dietary protein, may
explain the increase in total energy intake over the last
50 years [1].
The observed increase in dietary carbohydrates has
come primarily from added sugars, accounting for ap-
proximately 16%E of total energy intake [9]. The largest
single source of added sugar and discretionary energy in-
take in the American diet is sugar-sweetened beverages
(SSBs) [10]. In addition to increasing energy intake, SSBs
may
significantly
affect
postprandial
fat
oxidation.
Stookey et al. recently reported that the addition of
orange juice with a standard breakfast meal decreased
fat oxidation compared to the same meal coupled with
water [11]. This acute effect on net fat oxidation leads to
preferential increases in visceral adipose tissue when
consumed daily over long periods [12, 13]. Taken to-
gether, these results suggest that the consumption of
SSBs may be contributing to weight gain by adding en-
ergy to the diet and reducing fat oxidation. However, it
is not known whether the inclusion of a SSB with a
high-protein meal offsets the beneficial effects of in-
creased dietary protein on appetite, energy metabolism
and fat oxidation. We hypothesize that compared to
non-nutritive-sweetened beverage (NNSB) consumption,
consuming a SSB with a meal will increase appetite and
diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT) independent of diet-
ary protein. We also hypothesize that consumption of a
SSB will reduce postprandial fat oxidation and that this
effect will be greater when consumed with a usual
(15%E) protein meal compared to a higher (30%E)
protein meal.
Methods
Participants
A total of 34 healthy weight (BMI 18 - 25 kg/m2) adults
were recruited for participation. Of these, 5 participants
withdrew prior to any study related procedures and 2
participants withdrew after completing the first study
visit. The study was reviewed and approved by the
University of North Dakota Institutional Review Board.
Informed written consent was obtained for each partici-
pant prior the initiation of any study procedures.
Exclusion
criteria
included:
body
mass
index
(BMI) > 25 kg/m2; percent body fat greater than or
equal to 25% for males and 35% for females [14]; aller-
gies to any of the study foods, more than a 10% change
in body weight within the past 2 months; current or
planned pregnancy; lactation; metabolic illness/disease;
active cancer or in short-term remission (less than
3 years); infectious diseases; alcohol or drug abuse; to-
bacco use; presence of acute illness; taking medications
known to affect energy expenditure and appetite. This
trial
is
registered
at
https://clinicaltrials.gov
as
NCT02211599 on August 5, 2014.
Experimental protocol
All procedures were performed at the USDA Grand
Forks Human Nutrition Research Center (GFHNRC)
Metabolic Research Unit (MRU). The hypothesis was
tested using a double-blind, randomized, cross-over
design with beverage type (sugar vs non-nutritive
sweetener) and protein level (15%E vs 30%E) treated
as
within-subject
factors.
Before
starting,
each
participant completed a screening exam. This exam
included height, weight, body composition (Bod-Pod;
Casperson et al. BMC Nutrition  (2017) 3:49 
Page 2 of 12
 Cosmed, Chicago, IL), fasting glucose levels (Accu-Check
Avivia, Indianapolis, IN) after a ≥ 12 h overnight fast, and
a health history questionnaire. In addition, participants
received detailed instruction on keeping a 3-day food diary
to document eating patterns prior to each study visit.
Participants were instructed to maintain their habitual
eating habits and actives of daily living.
Participants received 15%E protein on one visit and
30%E protein on another visit. Participants were ran-
domized as to which dietary protein level (15%E or
30%E) they received first. The same %E of carbohydrate,
fat, and protein was consumed at both meals (breakfast,
lunch) within a testing day. At each study visit, partici-
pants received the NNSB at one meal and the SSB at the
other meal. The order of beverage type for each visit
was counterbalanced across participants. So, for study
visit 1, if the participant received the NNSB with the
breakfast meal, they received the SSB with their lunch.
The beverage order was then reversed for the partici-
pant’s second study visit. Each study visit was separated
by 1 to 8 weeks, dependent upon the subject’s schedule
and chamber availability. Females were measured during
the luteal phase of their menstrual cycle to control for
possible confounding effects of the menstrual cycle on
energy expenditure [15]. Participants were instructed
not to exercise for 48 to 72 h prior to their metabolic
studies. Participants completed a 7-day physical activity
assessment at each study visit. Participants were asked
to circle activities that they performed during the last
7 days continually for at least 10 min. Activities included
those perceived as both moderate and vigorous activities;
such as jogging/running, swimming laps, bowling, bas-
ketball, dancing and stair climbing. Participants were
then asked many how days during the past 7 days did
they do a moderate or vigorous activity and how much
time, on average, was spent doing the activities. The last
question asked the participant to compare their activity
over the past 7 days to their usual physical activity over
the previous 3 months.
Figure 1 depicts the experimental protocol. Partici-
pants reported to the MRU at 1700 h the evening prior
to the testing day. Each participant was weighed and
orientated
before
entering
the
metabolic
chamber.
Exercise was not permitted while in the chamber. A
non-study specific meal was provided at 1900 h. Water
was provided ad libitum and consumption was measured
throughout the 24 h chamber stay. At 2200 h the partici-
pant was instructed to turn off all electronic devices and
prepare for bed. Lights out occurred at 2230 h. The
following morning at 0700 h the participant was awak-
ened and asked to void their bladder. Urine at this void
was not collected. Participants were instructed to return
to bed and assume a semi-recumbent position for the
measurement of their resting metabolic rate (RMR; kcal/
day). RMR was then measured for 30 to 45 min. Criteria
for a valid RMR was a minimum of 20 min of steady
state, determined as a < 10% fluctuation in oxygen con-
sumption and <5% fluctuation in respiratory quotient.
Urine was collected at 1200 h and 1600 h, as well as any
voids occurring within those periods. Breakfast was
provided at 0800 h and lunch was served at 1200 h. Imme-
diately before and every 30 min after each meal partici-
pants rated their hunger, fullness, satiety, prospective food
consumption, and desire to eat something sweet, salty, sa-
vory or fatty using a computer-based visual analogue scale
(Sussex Ingestion Pattern Monitor, University of Sussex).
Meal compositions
Test meals were prepared and weighed by the GFHNRC
research kitchen. Meal macronutrient composition is
presented in Table 1. Diet 1 was formulated based on
the U.S. Dietary Guidelines providing 55% carbohy-
drates, 30% fat and 15% protein. Diet 2 was protein-rich
providing 40% carbohydrates, 30% fat, and 30% protein.
All meals were comprised of the same foods and pro-
vided 500 non-beverage kcals. To minimize the monot-
ony of consuming the exact same foods repeatedly,
meals were presented differently for breakfast and lunch
(Table 2). A 360 ml test beverage was served with each
meal. The test beverage was made with water, black
cherry powdered drink mix, and either sugar (31 g;
120 kcal) or a non-nutritive sweetener (sucralose; 4 g).
Sucralose was matched to the sugar based on manufac-
turer conversions. Presenting the beverages in this way

 ensured that both beverages had the same flavor profile
and level of sweetness. All test meals and beverages were
consumed within 20 min.
3-day food diaries
Participants completed a 3-day food diary prior to each
study visit to estimate usual macronutrient intake. A
Research Dietitian interviewed each participant during
their study visits to determine completeness and accur-
acy of the food diary. Dietary intake was analyzed
using the USDA National Nutrient Database for Stand-
ard Reference [16] and a customized in-house nutrient
analysis program. The customized in-house nutrient
analysis program (Grand Forks Research Analysis of
Nutrient Data) is an interactive coding element that
utilizes the USDA National Nutrient Database for
Standard Reference for nutrient data [16]. The analysis
program is not available for commercial use.
Specimen collection and analysis
Urine samples were pooled by time periods (morning
and afternoon) and volumes were recorded. Specific
gravity, protein content, and refractivity index were mea-
sured (Reichert, Inc. Depew, NY). Urine was aliquoted,
frozen and stored for later nitrogen analysis after each
collection period. Total nitrogen was determined using
Dumas combustion method (rapid N Exceed; Elementar
Americas Inc., Mt. Laurel, NJ).
Metabolic chamber
The
metabolic
chamber,
designed
by
MEI
Inc.
(Minneapolis, MN), is a 3.6 m long, 3.0 m wide, and
2.2 m high room having a total volume of 25m3. The
chamber is furnished with a bed, chair, desk, computer,
cable television, wireless access, sink, and toilet. Walls
and ceiling are constructed of 4 inch polyurethane
foam panels sandwiched between steel sheets. The
chamber has two windows providing outside views. A
gasket-sealed aluminum frame door containing two
transparent acrylic panels provides access to the cham-
ber. The door and the two outside windows contribute
to a sense of light and openness reducing anxiety. An
airlock system allows meal trays and other materials to
be passed to and from the participant. A ceiling
mounted HVAC unit containing blowers for air circu-
lation
and
particle
filters
maintains
constant
temperature and humidity in the chamber. The cham-
ber is equipped with temperature, humidity, and baro-
metric
pressure
sensors
to
monitor
and
provide
continuous feedback for maintaining a stable environ-
ment. A dimmer switch allowed participants to control
the brightness of the florescent ceiling lights. Micro-
wave motion sensor (BB-150, Museum Technology
Source Inc. Wilmington, MA) was used to detect par-
ticipant movement. Two video cameras (2600 IP Cam-
era, Cisco Systems Inc.; San Jose, CA), linked to
monitors located in the nurses station of the MRU,
provided remote monitoring of participant activity. A
smoke detector in the chamber connected to the fire
security system provided additional safety. Alarms
were set to monitor oxygen (O2), carbon dioxide
(CO2), temperature, and pressure in the chamber. Two
curtains could be drawn across the door and toilet
areas for privacy. When not needed the curtains were
kept against the walls to prevent air flow restriction.
The metabolic chamber operates in a push-pull
configuration. Both inflow and outflow O2 and CO2
concentrations are measured simultaneously allowing
operation at lower ventilation rates, improving reso-
lution, and response time. This configuration facili-
tates
using
doors
and
blood
ports
by
producing
minimal pressure differences between the chamber
and outside air. Inflow and outflow rates were main-
tained by PID control. Initially both flow rates were
kept low to bring O2 and CO2 to optimal levels for
the gas analyzers and then were adjusted up or down
as needed to maintain safe CO2 levels. Inflow and

 outflow rates were measured using thermal mass flow
meters (HFM-D-301, Teledyne Hastings Instruments;
Hampton, VA). Inflow rates were typically between
50 and 70LPM. A fraction of both inflow and out-
flow air was continuously withdrawn by pumps, fil-
tered, and passed through a drying column (Perma
Pure LLC; Toms River, NJ) before being analyzed. In-
flow and outflow O2 and CO2 concentrations were
measured using Ultramax/Oxymat 6 gas analyzers
(Siemens AG; Nuremberg, Germany). The oxygen an-
alyzers reference cells were supplied with a constant
flowing gas having a concentration of 21% O2 and
balance as nitrogen (N2).
Signals from analog sensors were routed into a
DAQ (Measurement Computing, Norton MA), digi-
tized and sent via USB bus to the controller PC.
Flow meters and gas analyzers signals were sent to a
National
Instrument
(Austin, TX)
RS232
to
USB
digital converter then sent to the controller PC by
USB bus. Data were logged at 60 s intervals. A back-
ward derivative was used to reduce noise and smooth
real-time graph data. Control and real-time monitor-
ing of the chamber was accomplished using a custom
template
developed
with
National
Instruments
LabVIEW software. A 20 min “null” was recorded
into the data file at the end of the chamber stay by
switching valves so both in and out flows measured
the same air source. The null measurement was
subsequently used to correct for any minor drift
between inflow and outflow analyzers that may have
developed.
Custom certified gas mixtures (21% O2, balance N2;
and 20% O2, 1% CO2, balance N2) were used to
calibrate O2 and CO2 analyzers using a two point
system.
Calibration
was
checked
prior
to
each
participant visit and immediately afterwards to con-
firm that no analyzer drift occurred during testing.
Validation was conducted monthly to ascertain func-
tional status of the chamber. A custom built gas
blender (MEI Inc., Minneapolis, MN) was used to
infuse
various
blends
of
CO2
and
nitrogen
(N2)
mimicking
different
metabolic
conditions
in
the
chamber for further validation.
Calculations and statistical analysis
Chamber data were imported into custom software
(PiLR; MEI Research, Ltd.) for the analysis of energy
metabolism and substrate oxidation. Briefly, average
minute values of V
̇ O2 and V
̇ CO2 were recalculated
using an 8 min center derivative and a Haldane filter.
Periods of interest, such as resting and post meals,
were set and average V
̇ O2, V
̇ CO2, EE, and RQ were
determined. A null offset was calculated and applied
to correct for differences between analyzers. Protein
oxidation derived from urinary nitrogen was used to
correct
carbohydrate
and
fat
oxidation

calculated as follows:

For the calculation of DIT, energy expenditure and ac-
tivity, as measured by Doppler radar, 30 min time pe-
riods after each meal were averaged and plotted to
determine the y-intercept for each individual’s linear
regression. DIT was then calculated as the difference
between individual resting metabolic rates and their y-
intercept [17]. DIT is also expressed as a percentage of
the energy content of the meal for the 240 min
postprandial period [18].
The effects of sex, protein level and beverage type and
their interaction on satiety, appetite for specific taste
profiles, DIT and rates of substrate oxidation were
assessed using a 3-way Repeated Measures ANOVA.
Multiple linear regression models were used to test
whether habitual macronutrient and energy intake pre-
dicted metabolic responses to the test meals. Indicator
variables were included in each model to test whether
the relationship between intake and response differed by
protein level and beverage type. Ratings of satiety and
appetite for specific taste profiles, protein level, and bev-
erage type were summarized by plotting the responses
over time and calculating the area under the curve
(AUC) using the trapezoid rule. Significance was set at
p ≤ 0.05. The primary dependent variable, upon which
the study is powered, is lipid oxidation. Power analyses
demonstrated that 15 subjects provided greater than
90% power to detect a protein effect of 2 g on lipid oxi-
dation [5] and a beverage effect of 5 g on lipid oxidation
[11] given a within-subject SD of 2 g at p = 0.05. Second-
ary dependent variables included energy expenditure,
DIT and protein and carbohydrate oxidation. Independ-
ent variables are sex (male, female), beverage type (SSB,
NNSB) and protein level (15%E, 30%E). All statistical
analysis was performed using SAS V9.4, SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, NC). Data are presented as meanSD unless
otherwise noted.

 Results
Participants
Twenty-seven healthy participants (13 male, 14 female)
completed the study. Subject characteristics were age:
23 ± 5 yr., height: 173 ± 11 cm, weight: 69 ±12 kg, BMI: 23
± 2 kg/m2, body fat: 20 ±6%, lean body mass (LBM): 54 ±
15 kg, fat mass (FM): 16 ±9 kg. There was no difference in
habitual dietary intake before the two study visits. Daily
energy consumption from the 3-day diet records for
study visit 1 and 2 was 2215 ± 613 kcal/day and 2192 ±
514 kcal/day, respectively. The macronutrient compos-
ition of the participants’ usual diet was 44 ±10%E carbohy-
drates, 17 ±5%E protein and 36 ±7%E fat for study visit 1
and 45 ±7%E carbohydrates, 18 ±4%E protein and 37 ±5%E
fat for study visit 2. Habitual protein consumption during
the study period was 93 ± 27 g protein/day or approxi-
mately 1.36 ±0.34 g protein/kg/day. Subject characteristics
by gender are provided in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Physical activity did not differ for the 7 days prior to
each study visit. Prior to visit 1, participants reported
36 ±26 min on 2.4 ±1.8 days of moderate physical activity
(MPA) and 17 ±19 min on 1.2 ±1.0 days of vigorous
activity (VPA). Prior to their second study visit; partici-
pants reported doing 30 ± 23 min on 2.5 ±1.8 days of
MPA and 25 ± 38 min on 1.2 ± 1.1 days of vigorous VPA.
Substrate oxidation
There was a main effect of sex (p = 0.0043) and
beverage
type
(p = 0.0356)
on
postprandial
fat
oxidation. Postprandial fat oxidation was greater in
the males (161 ± 44 g/day) compared to the females
(119 ± 37 g/day). Consuming a SSB with a meal sup-
pressed fat oxidation compared to NNSB consump-
tion (135 ± 45 g/day and 145 ± 46 g/day, respectively).
On average, postprandial fat oxidation decreased by
7.2 ±11 g and 12.6 ± 11 g with the addition of a SSB
to a meal (15% and 30% protein, respectively). There
was no significant main effect of protein amount nor
were there any significant interactions between sex,
protein amount, or beverage type on postprandial fat
oxidation (Fig. 2A and Table 3).
Postprandial fat oxidation was positively correlated
(r = 0.48;
p < 0.0001)
with
lean
body
mass
(LBM;
Additional file 2: Figure S1). When expressed relative
to LBM (g/kg LBM/day), there was a main effect of
beverage type (p = 0.0420). Adjusted fat oxidation
was greater after consuming a NNSB (2.6 ± 0.7 g/kg
LBM/day) with a meal compared to a SSB (2.4 ±
0.7 g/kg LBM/day). There were no significant main
effects of sex or protein amount nor were there any
significant interactions between sex, protein amount,
or beverage type on adjusted postprandial fat oxidation
(Fig. 2B and Table 3). There was no significant correlation
between postprandial fat oxidation and FM (Additional
file 2: Figure S2).
There was a main effect of sex (p = 0.0056) and protein
level (p = 0.0013) on postprandial protein oxidation. Pro-
tein oxidation was greater in the males (22 ± 8 g/day)
compared to the females (16 ± 5 g/day). Protein oxida-
tion was greater with the 30%E (21 ± 8 g/day) compared
to the 15%E (18 ± 6 g/day) protein meal. There was no
significant main effect of beverage type nor were there
any significant interactions between sex, protein amount,
or beverage type on postprandial protein oxidation
(Table 3).
Protein oxidation was positively correlated (r = 0.32;
p = 0.0010) with LBM (Additional file 2: Figure S1).
When expressed relative to LBM (g/kg LBM/day), there
was a main effect of the amount of dietary protein con-
tained in the meal (p = 0.0012). Adjusted postprandial
protein oxidation was greater after consuming a NNSB
(0.338 ± 0.112 g/kg LBM/day) with a meal compared

oxidation in response to meals containing 15%E or 30%E protein with a
sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) or non-nutritive-sweetened beverage
(NNSB) are presented as box and whickers plots with the line
representing the median, the box representing the 25th to 75th
percentiles and the whiskers representing the minimum to maximum
values. There were significant main effects of sex and beverage type on
absolute fat oxidation. Absolute fat oxidation was greater in the males
compared to the females. There was no main effect of sex after
adjustment for lean body mass (LBM). Fat oxidation was significantly
reduced after consuming a SSB. There was no significant main effect of
protein level nor were there any sex, protein level or beverage type
interactions. Items with similar letters are not significant different

 to a SSB (0.340 ± 0.123 g/kg LBM/day). There were
no significant main effects of sex or beverage type
nor were there any significant interactions between
sex, protein amount, or beverage type on adjusted
postprandial protein oxidation. There was no signifi-
cant correlation between postprandial protein oxida-
tion and FM (Additional file 3: Figure 2).
There was a main effect of beverage type (p < 0.0001) on
postprandial carbohydrate oxidation. Carbohydrate oxida-
tion was greater after SSB (271 ± 76 g/day) compared to
NNSB (231 ± 79 g/day) consumption with a meal. There
were no significant main effects of sex or the amount of

interactions between sex, protein amount, or beverage
type on postprandial carbohydrate oxidation (Table 3).
Postprandial carbohydrate oxidation was positively cor-
related with LBM (r = 0.28; p = 0.0035; Additional file 2:
Figure S1) and negatively correlated with FM (r = −0.32; p
= 0.0010; Additional file 3: Figure S2). When expressed
relative to LBM or FM, there was a main effect of bever-
age type (p = 0.0002). Adjusted carbohydrate oxidation
was greater after consuming a SSB (4.7 ± 1.4 g/kg LBM/
day and 22.9 ± 12.8 g/kg FM/day) with a meal compared
to a NNSB (4.0 ± 1.4 g/kg LBM/day and 19.8 ± 12.3 g/kg
FM/day). There were no significant main effects of sex or
protein amount nor were there any significant interactions
between sex, protein amount, or beverage type on ad-
justed postprandial carbohydrate oxidation.
Energy metabolism
There was a main effect of sex (p < 0.0001) and bever-
age type (p = 0.0004) on estimated 24 h energy ex-
penditure (EE). As expected, estimated 24 h EE was
greater in males (2713 ± 290 kcal/day) than females
(2133 ± 230 kcal/day) and greater after SSB consump-
tion (2463 ± 395 kcal/day) compared to NNSB con-
sumption
(2383 ± 384
kcal/day).
There
was
no
significant main effect of protein amount nor were
there any significant interactions between sex, protein
amount, or beverage type on 24 h EE (Fig. 3A and
Table 3).

 Estimated 24 h EE was positively correlated (r =
0.80; p < 0.0001) with LBM (Additional file 4: Figure
S3). When expressed relative to LBM, there a main
effect of sex (p = 0.0470) and beverage type (p =
0.0006). Adjusted 24 h EE was greater in females
(45 ± 5 kcal/kg LBM/day) than males (41 ± 5 kcal/kg
LBM/day) and greater after SSB consumption (44 ±
6 kcal/kg LBM/day) compared to NNSB consump-
tion (42 ± 4 kcal/kg LBM/day). There was no signifi-
cant main effect of protein amount nor were there
any
significant
interactions
between
sex,
protein
amount, or beverage type on adjusted 24 h EE (Fig.
3B and Table 3).
There was a main effect of beverage type (p = 0.0240) on
DIT. DIT was greater when participants consumed a
NNSB (18% ± 7%) with a meal compared to a SSB (15% ±
5%). There were no significant main effects of sex or
protein amount nor were there any significant interactions
between sex, protein amount, or beverage type on DIT
(Table 3). Although not significant, there was a trend
(p = 0.0690) for the amount of dietary protein contained
in the meal to increase DIT.
Effect of habitual macronutrient intake on metabolic
responses
Habitual carbohydrate intake did not predict carbohydrate
oxidation (F(3102) = 0.24, p = 0.86, R2 = 0.007). There was
a significant linear relationship between habitual fat intake
and fat oxidation (F(3102) = 7.60, p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.18),
protein intake and protein oxidation (F(3104) = 4.89, p =
0.003, R2 = 0.12) and energy intake and energy expenditure
(F(3104) = 8.19, p < 0.0001, R2 = 0.19); however, the slopes
did not vary by the protein level or beverage type in the
test meals (fat: p = 0.81, protein: p = 0.78, energy: p = 0.76).
Subjective appetite responses
Figure 4 depicts the area under the curve (AUC) for sub-
jective appetite sensations. There were significant main
effects of sex and dietary protein for all subjective
postprandial appetite sensations. Overall, the males reported
greater hunger (p = 0.0007) and prospective food intake
(p < 0.0001) and reduced fullness (p = 0.0015) and satiety
(p = 0.0013). Increasing dietary protein intake from 15%E
to 30%E decreased participant’s perception of their hunger
(p < 0.0001) and prospective food intake (p < 0.0001),
Fig. 4 Appetite sensation scores. Subjective appetite sensations of hunger (a), prospective food intake (b), fullness (c), and satiety (d) after meals
containing 15%E or 30%E protein with a sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) or a non-nutritive-sweetened beverage (NNSB) are presented as area under
the curve (AUC). Males reported feeling hungrier and that they could eat more food. Conversely, females reported greater feelings of fullness and satiety.
Hunger and satiety AUC were lower after consuming a meal of 30%E protein. There was no significant main effect of beverage nor were there any sex,
protein level or beverage type interactions. Items with similar letters are not significantly different. Data are presented as the mean ± SE

 while increasing their perception of fullness (p < 0.001)
and ratings of satiety (p < 0.0001). There was no significant
main effect of beverage type nor were there any significant
interactions between sex, protein amount, or beverage
type on subjective postprandial appetite sensations.
Figure 5 depicts the AUC for the appetite for foods with
specific taste profiles. The desire to eat something sweet
was not affected by sex, protein amount or beverage type.
There was a significant sex x protein level interaction
(p = 0.0113); however, post-hoc analysis did not reveal
any pair-wise significance. On the other hand, there
was a main effect of sex on the desire to eat something
savory (p < 0.0001), salty (p = 0.0090) and fatty (p = 0.0091)
with no significant interactions. The amount of dietary
protein in the preceding meal influenced the desire to eat
something savory (p = 0.0011), salty (p < 0.0001) and fatty
(p = 0.0188). Increasing dietary protein markedly lowered
the desire to consume these types of foods. In addition,
there was a significant protein level x beverage type inter-
action for the desire to eat something savory and salty
(p ≤ 0.05). Post-hoc analysis revealed that the primary
effect of this interaction was between meals containing
15%E protein consumed with a NNSB compared to 30%E
protein consumed with a NNSB.
Discussion
The primary goal of this research was to determine the
extent to which the addition of a SSB to standardized
meals differing in dietary protein impacts appetite, en-
ergy metabolism and substrate oxidation. We found that
SSB consumption modifies meal-induced alterations in
food preferences, energy expenditure and substrate oxi-
dation, thus, impacting both sides of the energy balance
equation. On the intake side, the additional energy in-
take from the SSB did not influence satiety and the de-
sire to eat savory and salty foods was increased when
paired with a protein-rich meal. On the expenditure
side, SSB consumption increased energy expenditure by
80 kcal, thus, creating a 40 kcal excess which was inde-
pendent of dietary protein. SSB also decreased postpran-
dial fat oxidation by 8%. These results highlight the
impact SSB consumption can have on energy balance
and substrate oxidation and provides further insight into
the potential role of SSBs in the etiology of obesity.

 The satiating effects of increasing dietary protein are well
documented (see review [19]). As expected, increasing
protein intake from 15%E to 30%E significantly reduced
subjective ratings of hunger and prospective food intake,
and increased ratings of fullness and satiety. The addition
of a SSB to the meal did not further alter appetite sensa-
tions. These results are in line with both acute [20–22] and
chronic [23, 24] studies showing little effect of sweetener
type, especially when consumed in liquid form, on appetite
sensations. In addition, dietary protein influenced food
preferences in that increasing protein intake decreased the
appetite for savory, salty and fatty foods. Consuming a SSB
with a higher protein meal produced an interactive effect
on food preferences in that it increased the appetite for
savory and salty foods. Both animals and humans learn that
specific taste profiles provide a general representation of
the nutrient content of the food being consumed. Foods
with a savory taste indicate a source of protein, a salty taste
is associated with the protein and sodium content of a
food, a sweet taste signifies a source of simple sugars [25],
and recent evidence supports a possible taste component
for dietary fats [26]. Interestingly, the present study found
a decrease in the appetite for fatty foods with the protein-
rich meal. If this truly reflects an alteration in the appetite
for fat, this study demonstrates, for the first time, that
increasing dietary protein could potentially decrease fat
intake from other food sources. Additional studies are
needed to elucidate a possible relationship between dietary
protein and fat intake. The observed differences in the
profiles for the appetite for savory and salty foods may be
a compensatory response to decreasing the absolute
amount of dietary protein and the dilution of the relative
amount of dietary protein with the addition of a SSB
[6, 7]. A limitation to this study is that we did not include
an ad libitum meal at the end of the study period. However,
these appetitive data support previous research showing a
greater intake of savory (higher protein) foods in response
to lower dietary protein intake [8, 27, 28]. Further research
is needed to determine if simply including a SSB with a
meal will also result in an increase in ad libitum protein
intake.
The effect of SSB consumption on energy intake has
received much attention [29–31]. Nevertheless, few
studies have examined alterations in energy expenditure
in response to SSBs. This is the first study to our know-
ledge to look at whether the inclusion of a single serving
size of a SSB ingested with standardized meals differing
in protein content affects energy metabolism. Inclusion
of a SSB increased estimated 24 h EE, yet, DIT (as a per-
centage of energy intake) decreased. Interestingly, this
negative effect of SSB consumption on DIT was greater
with the protein-rich meal compared to the standard
meal. The current quantitative thermogenesis data are in
agreement with other reports showing an increase in EE
after ingestion of sucrose compared to an equal serving
of unsweetened pregelantinized corn starch [32] or a
non-nutritive sweetener [33]. On the other hand, these
results conflict with those reported by Prat-Larquemin
et al. [33] showing no difference between sucrose and a
non-nutritive sweetener (aspartame; 0.27 g) on DIT. The
contradictory results could be attributed to differences
in meal composition. The current study added a SSB or
NNSB to standardized mixed meals compared to sweet-
ening a single food item. In addition, the energy content
of the solid foods was not adjusted in order to maintain
isocaloric conditions between the sugar-sweetened and
the non-nutritive sweetened trials. This allowed meas-
urement of the effects of a SSB as it is typically con-
sumed. The present results show that, although there is
an increase in overall daily EE with SSB consumption,
not all of the additional calories provided by the SSB are
expended. This small shift in the energy balance equa-
tion, if no further adjustments are made in energy intake
or expenditure through increased activity, may help ex-
plain the effect of SSB consumption on weight gain [34].
The reciprocal relationship between carbohydrate and
fat oxidation is well known (see review [35]). In this
study, carbohydrate oxidation increased in line with the
additional carbohydrates supplied by the SSB, independ-
ent of meal macronutrient composition. On the other
hand, there was almost a twofold difference in the
change in fat oxidation when the SSB was consumed
with the standard protein meal (7 g) compared to the
protein-rich meal (13 g). Bortolotti et al. recently re-
ported a greater suppression of fat oxidation when fruc-
tose was combined with a higher protein meal compared
to fructose supplementation alone [36]. Because fructose
is almost completely metabolized in the liver, and fat
oxidation and de novo lipogenesis share the same meta-
bolic pathways in the liver, it has been posited that the
suppression of fat oxidation is the result of increased de
novo lipogenesis [37]. In both animal and human trials,
the fructose component of sucrose, but not the glucose,
increases fractional de novo lipogenesis [38]. Other stud-
ies have shown that the long-term effect of increased
carbohydrate intake mediates lipogenesis rather than
oxidation [35]. Therefore, the suppression of fat oxida-
tion with repeated SSB consumption, especially when
paired
with
high-protein
meals,
over
time
could
potentially lead to a greater tendency to store fat and,
thus, increase body weight [35, 39].
The primary strength of this study was the control of
macronutrients and macronutrient subtypes. Consump-
tion of the same foods at each meal provided the oppor-
tunity to determine the impact of SSB consumption on
appetite, EE and macronutrient partitioning. In addition,
the whole-room calorimeter allowed for the precise
measurement of EE and substrate utilization in response
Casperson et al. BMC Nutrition  (2017) 3:49

 to minimal dietary changes. This study is not without lim-
itations. First, only healthy weight adults were recruited
for participation. It is possible that overweight and obese
individuals may respond differently to the changes in meal
macronutrient composition. However, the current study
of healthy weight adults provides a basic indication of
how SSB consumption can alter energy metabolism. Sec-
ond, the data are for single test meals with a high glycemic
index. Nonetheless, the foods used in the study permit ex-
ternal validity as they are most often the foods consumed
by the general public (potatoes and white bread). Caution
must be used when extrapolating these data to dietary
changes over a long period. Finally, we did not control for
the macronutrient composition of the habitual diet. Our
3-day diet records show that participants consumed a typ-
ical American diet based on current NHANES data [2]
and did not significantly vary from one visit to the next.
Additionally, the metabolic responses to the test meals
were the same when habitual macronutrient intakes were
used as a covariate.
Conclusions
The present results demonstrate the effect of SSB con-
sumption on energy metabolism and food choices. These
results reject our hypothesis that increasing dietary pro-
tein would correspond to a diminution in the effects of
SSB consumption. This work adds to the mounting evi-
dence that SSB consumption can increase an individual’s
susceptibility to weight gain and fat accumulation, espe-
cially when paired with a higher protein meal. These data
highlight the need to design strategies aimed at maximiz-
ing
macronutrient
balance
instead
of
focusing
on
interventions that strictly target energy balance.
