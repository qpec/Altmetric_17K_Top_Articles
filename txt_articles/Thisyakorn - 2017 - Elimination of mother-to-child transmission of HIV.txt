success in Thailand

ABSTRACT
In 1988, the generalised HIV/AIDS epidemic in Thailand began and in the same year the first 
HIV-exposed infant in Thailand was born at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok. 
From the early to mid-1990s, an epidemic wave of HIV-infected women and infants occurred. 
Heterosexual HIV transmission, as described in the Asian Epidemic Model, was the major 
mode of spread in Thailand, causing an increasing number of HIV-infected pregnant women. 
The early and concerted multi-sectoral response of Thai society reduced the prevalence of HIV 
infection in pregnant women from 2% in the mid-1990s to 0.6% in 2015 and mother-to-child 
transmission of HIV (MTCT) from an estimated 20–40% to 1.9%. Thus, Thailand became the first 
Asian country to achieve the World Health Organization’s (WHO) targets for the elimination of 
MTCT. In this narrative review, the key historic evolutions of the science and policy of prevention 
of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in Thailand that addressed the four prongs of 
the recommended WHO PMTCT strategy are described, and the lessons learned are discussed.

Introduction
Acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) was ini-
tially recognised in 1981 in homosexual men in North 
America, thereafter becoming a global epidemic. The 
first AIDS case in Thailand was reported in a Thai man 
in September 1984. After that, the generalised human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic occurred with 
a chain of transmission causing a rapid increase of HIV-
infected infants by 1991 [1, 2]. The first documented case 
of a Thai infant born to an HIV-infected mother was at 
King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok in July 
1988, and the first Thai infant with AIDS was reported 
in the same year at Ramathibodi Hospital, Bangkok. 
After that, the HIV seropositivity rate amongst pregnant 
women rose from 0.2% in 1990 to 2.06% in 1994 [3, 4].
The chain of transmission to infants
A chain of transmission in Thailand eventually leading 
to mother-to-child transmission of HIV (MTCT) to an 
infant is demonstrated by the epidemiological surveys 
conducted on the HIV epidemic in Thailand from 1988 
to 1997. These describe some of the sexual practices in 
Thai culture relating to MTCT.
In 1992, the first national survey of risk behaviour 
was conducted by the Programme on AIDS of the Thai 
Red Cross Society (TRCS) and Chulalongkorn University 
funded by the World Health Organization’s (WHO) global 
Programme on AIDS, subsequently used in advocacy with 
the Thai government. Of 2801 Thai men and women aged 
15–49 selected by stratified random sampling nation-
wide, 28% of men reported having had either premarital 
or extramarital sex in the last year, and three-quarters 
of them had paid for sex in the past year; 40% of men 
aged 20–24 had paid for sex. Amongst single men, 47% 
reported having had sex in the last year compared with 
4% of single women, while 17% of married men reported 
extramarital sex compared with less than 1% of women 
[5]. These data and other studies [2] suggested a high 
prevalence of male patronage of female commercial sex

Early responses in the prevention of mother-
to-child transmission of HIV (1988–1999)
Early epidemiological surveys of perinatal HIV infection 
in Thailand
The HIV epidemic waves in FSW and HSM in the early 
1990s was predicted to cause a further epidemic wave 
in women of reproductive age and consequently in chil-
dren by the mid-1990s [2]. Although biannual sentinel 
surveillance, including pregnant women in antenatal 
care (ANC) clinics, had been undertaken since 1989, 
more accurate epidemiological data on HIV in Thai 
women and their children was required to inform deci-
sion-making about PMTCT. Thus, a collaborative group of 
six Thai hospitals nationwide with extensive experience 
of HIV infection in children calculated the perinatal HIV 
transmission rate in Thailand between 1989 and 1994, 
estimating MTCT rates to be 25–42%, depending on the 
region [12].
With seroprevalence rates rising from <1% in 1989 to 
a peak of >7% in 1995, upper northern Thailand, which 
includes the six provinces of Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai, 
Lampang, Phayao, Lamphun and Mae Hong Son, was 
considered to be the epicentre of the generalised Thai 
HIV epidemic during the early years from 1988 to 1992. 
Indeed, the highest perinatal transmission rate of 42% 
was in Chiangrai Hospital, a tertiary hospital in the pro-
vincial capital of Chiangrai, possibly reflecting an earlier 
start of the epidemic wave in Thai women who were not 
FSW and became immunocompromised in greater num-
bers before those in other regions [12].
The reasons for the severity of the HIV epidemic in the 
early 1990s in upper northern Thailand are controversial 
because the data on intravenous drug users (IDU) in the 
region were limited. It has been suggested that the cause 
was an estimated large number of Thai IDUs in the region, 
some of whom may have transmitted HIV to FSWs. The 
high prevalence of IDUs may have been caused by the 
clearance of growing operations of opium for smoking 
in upper northern Thailand, leading to increased heroin 
imports from Myanmar and Laos to satisfy demand for 
opiates amongst Thai users [13].
National public health promotion campaign and the 
100% condom programme
Before 1990, the Thai general public thought that HIV/
AIDS only affected certain populations such as men who 
have sex with men, male commercial sex workers, for-
eigners and IDUs. Because of this and the need to pro-
mote the tourist industry during the 1980s, government 
officials played down the potential for an HIV epidemic 
in Thailand [14]. However, the first national sentinel 
surveillance in 1990 reported a dramatically increasing 
seroprevalence in some high-risk populations, prompt-
ing government action.
workers (FSW) in 1992. They also suggested a gender 
difference in sexual behaviour. Traditionally, Thai het-
erosexual men (HSM) may have premarital intercourse 
with multiple partners and extramarital intercourse with 
FSW because they are commonly believed to require 
sexual variety. However, Thai women are not expected 
to engage in premarital or extramarital intercourse [6].
The gender difference in sexual demand and supply 
has caused a large commercial sex industry in Thailand. 
An annual census of commercial sex work by the Thai 
Department of Communicable Disease Control (CDC) 
reported 86,494 FSW working in 6160 establishments 
nationwide in 1990 although other estimates suggest 
around 500,000 [2].
Non-commercial extramarital and premarital sex is 
thought to play a role in spreading HIV amongst Thai 
women. Some wealthier Thai men traditionally support 
one or more minor wives, and unmarried men may have 
casual non-commercial or premarital sex with a long-
term partner [7–9].
At the beginning of the Thai HIV epidemic, low rates 
of condom use may have promoted the rapid spread of 
infection in Thai women in the early 1990s. Only 30% 
of married men reported consistent condom use, while 
urban unmarried men were twice as likely to use con-
doms as those in rural areas (48 vs. 24%, respectively). 
Increased, consistent use of condoms was associated 
with men with secondary or higher education compared 
with men who without (47 vs. 23%, respectively) [5].
Thai women living with HIV/AIDS (WLWHA) have 
suffered from negative perceptions and attitudes in 
Thai society because physical and moral appearances 
are important. One of the barriers to prevention of 
mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) is the 
stigmatisation and discrimination associated with Thai 
WLWHA. Qualitative studies of Thai WLWHA using inter-
views report anticipated stigmatisation on disclosure 
of their serostatus to family and friends, employers and 
co-workers as well as society. Reasons given included 
fear of being thought promiscuous, unsympathetic 
treatment by family and friends, unfair dismissal from 
work or ostracisation from the local community, all of 
which have been reported. Thus, Thai WLWHA refuse 
to return to the hospital where they tested positive or 
to receive home visits by health care workers. They fear 
intentional or unintentional disclosure of their serosta-
tus by health care workers. Thai WLWHA have often not 
disclosed their serostatus to sexual partners, family and 
friends, and some have even migrated away from their 
local communities. The stigma may have been caused 
by the mass media and public health promotion cam-
paigns using scare tactics to alter behaviour in the 1980s. 
However, recent studies have indicated that reactions 
towards Thai WLWHA vary greatly socially and geograph-
ically and that perceptions and attitudes are becoming 
more positive [10, 11].
 PAEDIATRICS AND INTERNATIONAL CHILD HEALTH 
 
 101
Under the advocacy and leadership of the minister 
for AIDS, Mechai Viravaidya, an intensive public health 
information promotion campaign was launched. During 
1991–1992, national radio and television broadcast man-
datory hourly 1-min HIV/AIDS education items. These 
addressed HIV/AIDS not only as a health issue but also a 
social one, emphasising prevention through behavioural 
change including condom use. Many government min-
istries provided educational initiatives sensitive to Thai 
cultural needs. Because communication about sexual 
behaviour between parents and adolescents is often 
limited, the Ministry of Education launched peer educa-
tion programmes amongst students, causing education 
about sexual behaviour to be better received through 
friends. Private initiatives by non-government (NGO) 
and community-based organisations also played roles 
in educating and promoting behavioural change, for 
example, the Thai Business Coalition on AIDS that pro-
motes education and prevention about HIV/AIDS in the 
workplace [14, 15].
Low use of condoms was reported in the late 1980s 
and early 1990s [16]. Thus, a national programme to 
promote condom use by commercial sex workers was 
established in 1991/92. After a successful innovative pilot 
project by Dr Rojanapithayakorn, the regional director 
of the Thai CDC in Ratchaburi Province, a national ‘100% 
Condom Programme’ was developed.
The 100% Condom Programme was supervised at 
the provincial government level, involving pragmatic 
multi-sectoral collaboration between local public health 
officials, sex establishment owners, local police and sex 
workers to promote 100% condom use by male patrons 
of commercial sex workers. Monitoring was undertaken 
by an extensive network of sexually transmitted infection 
(STI) clinics to identify HIV infection in male clients of sex 
establishments or FSW. This would be taken as evidence 
of violation by the sex establishment owner of the pro-
gramme by their FSW. The owner would then receive a 
warning and ultimately could face permanent closure of 
the establishment [2].
Poor quality and the relatively high cost of condoms 
were seen as an obstacle to the campaign’s success. To 
address this, the Thai Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) 
instructed distributors and vendors to store condoms 
appropriately in environments with low humidity and 
no exposure to sunlight. The MOPH provided around 
60 million condoms which were distributed through STI 
clinics to FSW (typically a box of 100 condoms) and male 
clients as well as in workplaces, hotels and to NGOs [17].
The 100% Condom Programme contributed to 
increased use of condoms by male clients of FSW (from 
25% in 1989 to 94% in 1993), as well as decreased rates 
of premarital or extramarital sex in HSM (28–15%) and 
of visiting FSW from 22% in 1990 to 10% in 1993 [18]. 
After the financial crisis of 1997/98, the distribution of 
free condoms was dramatically curtailed, and a social 
marketing policy was adopted instead. In 2008, the 
national Behavioral Surveillance Survey [19] reported 
50–76% consistent condom use by male students, mili-
tary recruits and male factory workers when visiting FSW, 
while 20–40% of students had used a condom during 
the last sexual contact with their partner. The incidence 
of HIV infection amongst pregnant women visiting ANC 
clinics rose from 0.05% per year in 2005 to 0.18% per year 
in 2008 and was the greatest amongst females <20 years 
[20].
Infant formula for HIV-infected mothers
Breast-feeding by HIV-infected mothers has been dis-
couraged by the MOPH since 1993 because the risk 
of MTCT was estimated to be 20–40% [21]. This was 
based on the WHO/UNICEF Consensus Statement on 
HIV Transmission and Breast-feeding in 1992 [22] and a 
decision analysis model by Heymann [23].
The WHO/UNICEF Consensus Statement on HIV 
Transmission and Breast-feeding stated that in settings 
where infectious diseases are not the primary cause of 
death during infancy, pregnant women known to be HIV-
infected should be advised not to breastfeed but to use 
a safe alternative [22].
The decision-analysis model looked at the risk of 
child mortality from breast-feeding by HIV-infected 
mothers related to the under-5 child mortality rate 
(CMR). An under-5 CMR of <60/1000 live births was esti-
mated as appropriate for recommending bottle-feeding 
because the benefit of preventing transmission of HIV by 
breast-feeding would outweigh the risk of death from 
other causes, especially infectious diseases. The under-5 
CMR in Thailand has been <60/1000 live births since 1981 
[23].
A safe and economically feasible supply of infant for-
mula was also required. The government therefore pro-
vided a free infant formula for children of HIV-infected 
mothers. Thereafter, the MTCT rates without anti- 
retroviral therapy (ART) decreased from 31% in 1994 to 
19% in 1997 [24–27].
Free infant formula continues to be provided by the 
national PMTCT policy despite the introduction of free, 
point-of-care WHO option B + in 2014. The MOPH main-
tains this policy to achieve <1% perinatal transmission 
by 2030, and Thailand has an established programme to 
support infant formula replacement feeding. Perinatal 
transmission may still be possible in a breast-feeding 
mother taking the WHO option B+. A study amongst 
infants and mothers on lifelong ART estimated a rate of 
transmission at 18 months of 4.1% (95% CI 2.2–7.6) [28]. 
The vast majority in Thailand also have access to safe 
drinking water, good sanitation and a guaranteed free 
supply of infant formula, and mothers and caregivers are 
usually competent to safely bottle-feed infants and have 
access to comprehensive child health services.

first 14–16 weeks in breast-feeding women compared 
with zidovudine (transmission rates 9.4 and 18.9%, 
respectively) [34]. In 2004, a triple-drug regimen (TDR) 
of zidovudine and lamivudine with one of nevirapine, 
efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir was introduced, achiev-
ing a transmission rate as low as 1.1% in 1832 pregnant 
women between 2004 and 2010 at a duration of TDR of 
10.4 (7.3–13.4) weeks [35]. Zidovudine for 6 weeks post-
partum and free infant formula until 12 months of age 
have also been provided for all TRCS regimens.
National prevention of mother-to-child 
transmission of HIV policy (2000 to the 
present)
From 1997 to 1999, the MOPH implemented pilot PMTCT 
projects in Thailand to provide HIV testing for pregnant 
women and zidovudine for PMTCT together with a moni-
toring system [36, 37]. In 2000, the MOPH announced the 
first national PMTCT policy and issued guidelines for all 
government hospitals to integrate PMTCT activities into 
routine maternal and child health services, including HIV 
counselling and voluntary testing of all pregnant women, 
ART for PMTCT and provision of infant formula for HIV-
exposed infants. This programme covers all public and 
private health-care facilities. Since 2003, the government 
has funded PMTCT services for Thais under the univer-
sal health coverage policy. From 2007 to 2014, non-Thai 
HIV-infected pregnant women could access PMTCT ser-
vices through a Global Fund project. These services can 
currently be accessed through hospital social welfare 
funds, the ‘Save a Child’s Life from AIDS’ project of the 
TRCS, government-sponsored migrant health insurance 
or other special projects.
ART regimens in the national PMTCT policy have 
changed as prevention has evolved. At inception in 2000, 
zidovudine starting at 34 weeks gestation was offered 
to HIV-positive pregnant women, and zidovudine for 
4 weeks was given to newborns. In 2004, a single-dose 
of nevirapine (WHO option A) was added, and, since 
2010, highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) (WHO 
option B) has been offered during pregnancy, continuing 
post-partum based on CD4 count. Since 2014, HAART for 
life regardless of CD4 count (WHO option B+) has been 
offered to Thais universally. In the same year, modification 
of the national PMTCT guidelines classified infants on the 
basis of the risk of acquiring HIV. Those with a standard 
risk receive zidovudine for 4 weeks. Infants at high risk, 
namely maternal plasma HIV viral load >50 copies/mL 
or infants of mothers taking HAART for <4 weeks before 
delivery, are offered zidovudine, lamivudine and nevirap-
ine for 6 weeks [38]. Both standard and high-risk infants 
receive HIV DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing 
at 1, 2 and 4 months. All children born to HIV-positive 
mothers have confirmatory HIV antibody testing at 
18 months [39].
Thai Red Cross zidovudine donation programme
In 1994, the Paediatric AIDS Clinical Trials Group (PACTG) 
protocol 076 demonstrated that providing zidovudine 
to women during the second and third trimesters of 
pregnancy during labour and to newborns could reduce 
MTCT by 67% [29]. This was confirmed by several sub-
sequent studies, showing that infection rates in infants 
whose mothers received the PACTG 076 zidovudine reg-
imen were 3.4–8.6% [30].
The PACTG 076 zidovudine regimen, avoidance 
of breast-feeding and delivery by Caesarean section 
were adopted as the standard of care in most high- 
income countries, which thereafter reported significant 
reduction in paediatric cases of HIV infection and AIDS. 
However, because these strategies are expensive and 
complex, their implementation in most of low- and some 
middle-income countries is not possible.
The HIV epidemic in pregnant women in Thailand 
peaked at an HIV prevalence of 2.5% in 1995 [31]. 
However, there was no national PMTCT programme 
at that time. Thus, under the patronage of Her Royal 
Highness Princess Soamsawali and with the support 
of the MOPH, the TRCS initiated a zidovudine donation 
campaign, ‘Save a Child’s Life from AIDS’ in February 1996. 
The key objectives were PMTCT by procuring zidovudine 
funded by donation for HIV-infected pregnant women 
and to test the feasibility and acceptability of zidovu-
dine therapy. All interested hospitals nationwide with 
adequate supportive infrastructure could request free 
zidovudine from the TRCS. In 94 hospitals nationwide, 
over 7000 HIV-infected pregnant women have been pro-
vided with ART since 1996, and over 7700 HIV-free infants 
have been born [32]. Donations are received from indi-
viduals, groups and organisations including the MOPH 
and UNICEF, through the TRCS’s annual fund-raising 
events, especially the nationwide Red Cross Red Ribbon 
Sale on 26 February each year, and through miscellane-
ous activities. This ‘community-to-community’ approach 
involves donations and activities by one section of the 
community to help another. Buddhist Thais believe that 
charitable acts ‘make merit’ that can bring oneself good 
fortune later. Furthermore, the donation campaign has 
stimulated public awareness, contributing to a better 
understanding of HIV/AIDS in Thailand. The programme 
was selected as one of the UNAIDS best practices in the 
year 2000 [33].
The ART regimens for the ‘Save a Child’s Life from 
AIDS’ programme of the TRCS have also evolved with 
advances in prevention. At its inception in 1996, zidovu-
dine was offered at any time from 14 to 34 weeks ges-
tation until delivery along with peripartum 3 × 100 mg 
tablets zidovudine q3 h. A single dose of nevirapine for 
the mother during labour and the newborn within 72 h 
of birth was added in 2000 after the HIVNET 012 proto-
col demonstrated an almost 50% reduction in the risk 
of postpartum perinatal transmission of HIV during the 
 PAEDIATRICS AND INTERNATIONAL CHILD HEALTH

there was no integration of HIV counselling and ART 
knowledge into the regular curriculum of health-care 
programmes. Thus, 2-day courses on HIV medicine 
and programme implementation were held between 
2000 and 2004, and approximately 8000 health-care 
 
professionals (physicians, nurses, counsellors, laboratory 
technicians and pharmacists) in 908 hospitals received 
training. University experts, public health programme 
managers at various levels, physicians, scientists, 
researchers, NGOs and PLWHA developed the curricu-
lum with two components. The first described global and 
national policy, trends in ART, general HIV knowledge and 
HIV care including prevention and treatment of oppor-
tunistic infections, and ART management. The second 
focused on specific training in management of the drug 
supply chain for pharmacists, diagnostic and monitoring 
laboratory techniques for collecting and sending blood 
specimens and reagent supply chain management for 
laboratory technicians, and HIV and ARV counselling for 
adults and children and adherence issues for counsellors. 
Multi-sectoral collaboration and partnerships between 
the Departments of Health, Mental Health and Medical 
Services, the Thai AIDS Society, NGOs and PLWHA pro-
vided the training. Trained health-care professionals who 
had attended trainer training courses became consult-
ants in their local areas [41].
The monitoring of HIV/AIDS in Thailand has improved. 
Before the national PMTCT policy was introduced, the 
army and the Epidemiology Division of the MOPH began 
surveillance in high-risk groups in 1989. Initially, data 
on pregnant women were collected through ANC ser-
vices in 14 provinces, expanding to all 73 provinces by 
1990. In 2000, the MOPH introduced the Perinatal HIV 
Intervention Monitoring System (PHIMS) to monitor 
PMTCT services. PHIMS collects monthly reports from 
hospitals of HIV testing of pregnant women and their 
partners as well as ART coverage for PMTCT. PHIMS is 
integrated into routine hospital reporting activities. 
By 2015, PHIMS covered 92% of government hospitals 
(77% of total deliveries including Thais and non-Thais). 
To monitor perinatal HIV outcomes, the MOPH created 
the Perinatal HIV Outcome Monitoring System (PHOMS) 
in 2001. Initially, 64 public hospitals in four of the coun-
try’s 77 provinces submitted data on the number of 
infants born to HIV-positive mothers, the number of 
HIV-infected infants and the MTCT rate. This system 
expanded to 191 facilities in 14 provinces during 2004–
2007. In 2008, the National AIDS Programme to moni-
tor national HIV treatment and care services replaced 
PHOMS. Infant HIV DNA PCR test results reported by the 
National AIDS Programme are used to calculate MTCT 
rates. From 2001 to 2012, these rates included HIV-
exposed infants who were not tested for HIV or whose 
test results were not reported. Adjusted MTCT rates from 
2013 to 2015 have been calculated using SPECTRUM 
version 5.4 [38].
Other programme evolutions include HIV couples 
counselling and voluntary testing, infant HIV testing, 
a training curriculum for hospital personnel to reduce 
discrimination against people living with HIV/AIDS 
(PLWHA), monitoring systems which promote data use 
for improvement of the national programme and deliv-
ery service guidelines.
Since 2010, couples counselling and voluntary HIV 
testing have been offered. Couples HIV counselling 
should emphasise confidentiality, prevention of hori-
zontal transmission, and psychosocial issues of sero-
discordance and problem-solving. This is intended to 
promote mutual disclosure amongst couples to prevent 
transmission and stigmatisation. Pregnant women are 
offered voluntary HIV testing by rapid test and other 
screening tests including for syphilis, hepatitis B (HBsAg) 
and thalassaemia. In the case of a female pregnant part-
ner carrier, men are offered screening for HIV, syphilis 
and thalassaemia. Pregnant women testing HIV-positive 
should be followed up with an immediate CD4 count 
and then every 6 months. ART is offered immediately, 
regardless of CD4 count. Further STI testing for gonor-
rhoea, chlamydia and other vaginal infections should be 
undertaken. The high-risk group of intravenous-drug- 
using, pregnant women should be screened for hepatitis 
C (anti-HCV). Tuberculosis screening is offered to those 
with a history of exposure or suspicious signs or symp-
toms, and they should also be checked for any signs or 
symptoms of opportunistic infections. Integration of 
the PMTCT service into family planning and reproduc-
tive health services has also been instrumental assuring 
confidentiality and retaining continuity of care.
Infant HIV-testing has been improved. From 2000 
until 2006, antibody testing was undertaken at 12 and 
18 months of age, while DNA PCR testing in research 
studies or other projects was performed in only some 
infants aged >2 months. Early infant diagnosis (EID) with 
HIV DNA PCR at 1, 2 and 4 months of age was introduced 
in 2014. Guidelines recommend that any infant testing 
positive by rapid test should receive a confirmatory PCR 
test as soon as possible and all HIV-exposed infants 
should also receive HIV antibody testing at 18 months 
of age regardless of PCR results. The cost and complex-
ity of timely collection, transportation, testing biological 
samples and returning results to patients is challenging. 
However, Thailand has 15 nationwide laboratory net-
works for PCR testing. Under the universal health cov-
erage policy, EID services are currently free for infants 
aged <12 months in all public and private hospitals (906 
public and 45 private hospitals). Whole blood or dried

systems to the national level including PHIMS and 
PHOMS providing monthly data further enhanced 
PMTCT efforts by quantifying the need and efficacy of 
interventions. Data from PHOMS (2001–2007) and the 
National AIDS Programme (from 2008 to the present) 
have been used to monitor the performance of PMTCT 
and to improve missed opportunities for prevention, and 
the latest evaluation was undertaken in 2011 [43].
The Asian epidemic model
Modelling has attempted to predict the future course of 
HIV in Thailand. Early modelling attempts since 1994 by 
the National Economic and Social Development Board 
using EPIMODEL projected the numbers of new infec-
tions in men, women and children separately and were 
successfully used in advocacy to the government and 
NGOs [3]. However, because of its theoretical nature, the 
accuracy of this model was limited. Developed in col-
laboration between the TRCS and the East West Centre, 
the Asian Epidemic Model (AEM) reflects the infections, 
behaviour and movement of primary groups and trans-
mission modes driving HIV transmission in Thailand and 
has been used since 1990 (Figure 1).
The user adjusts AEM fitting parameters to create HIV 
prevalence outputs matching observed epidemiologi-
cal trends. This semi-empirical approach produces more 
accurate predictions with a large number of inputs from 
national monitoring of infections and outcomes as well 
as national social and behavioural survey data. Data from 
AEM and other inputs are then used in SPECTRUM 5.4 
integrated with the Estimation and Projection Package 
to model MTCT (Figure 2) [44].
AEM predictions correlate well with the observed data 
and are used to inform decision-making about HIV/AIDS 
policy in Thailand [44, 45]. This emphasises the impor-
tance of a diverse range of high-quality monitoring and 
survey data for successful elimination of MTCT.
Addressing the four prongs of the WHO PMTCT 
strategy
Prong 1: Primary prevention of HIV in women of childbear-
ing age. WHO recommendations include condom use, 
Elective Caesarian section is recommended at 
38 weeks of confirmed gestation for HIV-infected women 
in a setting that is safe and feasible with the following 
indications: viral load >1000 copies/mL at 36 weeks or 
previously unknown viral load, poor compliance with 
ART or late ANC with <4 weeks of ART, no ANC and no 
ART as well as according to general obstetric indica-
tions for Caesarian section. For vaginal deliveries, inva-
sive procedures such as foetal scalp electrodes, forceps 
extraction, vacuum extraction and artificial membrane 
rupture are not recommended, unless indicated. This is 
because MTCT risk is increased by premature rupture of 
the membrane (PROM)>4 h prior to delivery. If PROM has 
occurred, labour should be induced to reduce delivery 
time. Episiotomy should be performed carefully at the 
correct time to reduce the risk of exposing the newborn 
to maternal blood and body fluid [42].
From the early multi-sectoral response to the HIV 
epidemic to the evolution of an effective national 
PMTCT policy under a strong national health care ser-
vice, Thailand has successfully eliminated MTCT. In 2015, 
98.3% of pregnant women attended an ANC clinic at 
least once (WHO elimination target >95%). The per-
centage of pregnant women tested for HIV has increased 
from 61.9% in the pilot PMTCT projects in 1998 to 99.6% 
under the national PMTCT policy in 2015 (WHO elimina-
tion target >95%). HIV prevalence in pregnant women 
has decreased from 2% in the mid-1990s to 0.6% in 2015, 
and MTCT has fallen from 20–40% to 1.9% (WHO elimina-
tion target <2% in non-breast-feeding populations). The 
use of ART for PMTCT has increased from 64.6% in 1998 
to 95.6% in 2015 (WHO elimination target >90%) [38].
Lessons learned
The successful elimination of MTCT was made possible by 
an effective monitoring system. This enabled modelling 
of the HIV epidemic in Thailand which was instrumental 
in bringing about a massive, well-focused multi-sectoral 
response across Thai society with the support of various 
foreign NGOs. The four prongs of WHO’s recommended 
PMTCT strategy have been successfully addressed.
Monitoring systems
In 1989, soon after suspicions of a silent epidemic were 
raised, the Epidemiology Division of the MOPH began 
nationwide bi-annual HIV sentinel surveillance in high-
risk groups including pregnant women. The Thai army 
and MOPH identified and described the epidemic 
waves in FSW and HSM. This enabled a massive national 
response by the government and other sectors of soci-
ety. Epidemiological data were also useful in focusing HIV 
prevention measures in high-risk groups, on high-risk 
behaviour and in the worst affected regions. Knowing 
where to allocate resources is crucial in resource-limited 
settings. The evolution and expansion of monitoring

conventional HIV/AIDS education has evolved from Thai 
studies of risky behaviour and its determinants. These 
studies found that many mistakenly believed that they 
only had a transmission risk of HIV from interaction 
with certain identifiable persons in high-risk groups 
such as IDUs or brothel-based FSWs at the beginning 
of the epidemic. For example, a non-brothel-based FSW 
with a clean and tidy appearance was often incorrectly 
assumed to be a low HIV-transmission risk because she 
was assumed to have had fewer sexual partners and to 
be hygienic. Thus, the educational message was evolved 
to address the underlying social, cultural and economic 
forces driving the epidemic to create a proper under-
standing of the causes and risks for transmission. The 
new peer education approach was developed from a 
pilot workshop programme organised by the Paediatric 
Society of Thailand from 1995 until 2006. This involved a 
2-day course for 11–15-year-old secondary school pupils 
and HIV/AIDS educationalists. The aims were increased 
awareness of HIV/AIDS, and its physical and social effects 
as well as behaviour practices considered to be risky. A 
combination of educationalist-led and participant-led 
lessons and activities was used. Participating students 
were asked to disseminate the information learned to 
their peers [48]. This fostered life-skills empowerment 
rather than behaviour modification so that their culture, 
peer pressure and norms would promote safer sexual 
behaviour [49]. A national survey in 2009 of 19–49-year-
old Thai women reported 85.2% of 15–24-year-old 
females had received some formal instruction in sex edu-
cation, family planning and reproductive tract infection 
[47]. Despite previous and current measures to address 
Prong 1, recent data suggest a possible resurgence of 
MTCT in the younger generation of Thais who were not 
of reproductive age in the 1990s when the public health 
campaign was most intensive [19, 20].
In 2016, the Thai PMTCT programme includes coun-
selling and voluntary HIV testing as part of a comprehen-
sive package of ANC services. Couples counselling and 
voluntary testing is recommended to encourage mutual 
disclosure to encourage communication between sexual 
information and counselling about the risk of sexual HIV 
transmission, testing and counselling for pregnant and 
post-partum women as a part of routine reproductive 
health services and management of STI in women of 
reproductive age.
The highly successful Thai Population Programme 
for family planning services was introduced in the early 
1970s and has increased contraception rates from 14.8% 
in the early 1970s to79.6% in 2009 [46, 47].
The 100% Condom Programme and public health 
education campaigns to promote safe sex and discour-
age high-risk behaviour have been crucial in preventing 
HIV infection in women of reproductive age by breaking 
the chain of transmission by HIV-infected FSW to HSM 
and consequently to non-FSW Thai women.
The success of these interventions resulted from 
strong political leadership and commitment, heavy 
government investment and a pragmatic multi-sector 
response by Thai society. In 1991, the national AIDS pol-
icy of Thailand was transferred from the MOPH to the 
Office of the Prime Minister by Prime Minister Anand 
Panyarachun following advocacy by the then Minister 
of AIDS, Mechai Viravaidya. A National AIDS Prevention 
and Control Committee, which included the MOPH as 
the secretariat and was chaired by the prime minister, 
was formed and met quarterly until 1999. The  
positioning 
of the policy signalled to all government and non- 
government sectors to respond. After 1991, the govern-
ment greatly increased investment in the national HIV/
AIDS programme. In 1988, the government spent only 
US$684,000 on HIV/AIDS, while most funds came from 
NGO donations. By 1997, government spending on the 
programme had increased to US$82 million with only 
4% being donations. This political commitment and 
increased investment included the provision of 60 mil-
lion free condoms in the 100% Condom Programme and 
mass media campaigns. These were effective in increas-
ing condom use and decreasing high-risk sexual behav-
iour amongst men [31].
School-based education on the risk of HIV transmis-
sion has been provided by the MOPH since 1990, and 
Figure 2. the structure of sPectrUM 5.4 integrated with ePP to model Mtct in thailand [44].

as possible and measures to reduce the risk of MTCT. 
Prong 4 includes HIV testing of women, male partners 
and children, CD4 testing and clinical staging to deter-
mine eligibility for ART in both pregnant women and 
infants, screening for and treatment of opportunistic 
infections and linkages to longitudinal child, reproduc-
tive and HIV health services [53]. The high ANC rates in 
Thailand are key as it is the first part of a ‘cascade’ leading 
to appropriate ART for mother and infant and access to 
other health services. Thai guidelines recommend pre-
test counselling and voluntary HIV rapid test at the first 
ANC visit with same-day results and re-testing later in the 
pregnancy for HIV-negative women and their partner if 
possible. Guidance for women presenting late to ANC, 
at labour, at delivery or post-partum recommends vol-
untary testing immediately with same-day results. CD4 
testing and referrals and consultations with other health 
care services are offered to any seropositive pregnant 
woman [42].
Reducing the cost of providing ART is crucial to 
PMTCT programmes in resource-limited settings. Initially 
in 1996, the expense of the PACTG 076 protocol regimen 
was prohibitive, and donations from Thai society and 
foreign NGOs were necessary. Thus, studies establish-
ing the efficacy of shorter, less expensive ART regimens 
were conducted to reduce the cost of therapy. Legal bat-
tles were also fought with pharmaceutical companies 
because of the World Trade Organization’s Agreement 
on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights 
that limited the scope of generic drug production in 
Thailand since compliant Thai government regulations 
were introduced in 1998 under threat of sanctions from 
the United States of America. The solution to prohibi-
tive costs was compulsory licensing of non-commercial 
(government) use and patent challenges. Thailand’s 
Government Pharmaceutical Organisation has been 
producing generic ART since 1995, and the price dif-
ference between these generic and patented ART is 
large. For example, a generic fixed-dose triple combi-
nation of stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine cost 
US$360/patient/per year compared with US$4376 for 
the  
patented equivalent in 2007 [54].
The future challenges and evolution of PMTCT in 
Thailand
Despite significant achievements, challenges remain 
for Thai PMTCT. Coverage of couple counselling (60% of 
service outlets in 2014) and testing (only 42% of cou-
ples in ANC services) is low. More innovations, training, 
staff incentives and outcome monitoring are needed 
to increase levels of service delivery. Non‐Thai preg-
nant women do not universally access PMTCT services 
in Thailand, possibly because the service is not free to 
them through the national PMTCT programme [55]. 
Thus, funding must be found for this population. Pooled 
partners about contraception. This is suitable in Thailand 
because of the very high rate of ANC (98.9% in 2009) [50]. 
ANC services also include testing for hepatitis B, syphilis 
and other STIs if suspected, and referral to STI services 
is recommended [42]. The interventions addressing 
Prong 1 have decreased the estimated number of new 
HIV infections in adult women from 34,710 in 1992 to 
2226 in 2016 [45].
Prong 2: Prevention of unintended pregnancies in 
women living with HIV. Because of its high ANC rates, 
Thailand has included prevention of unintended preg-
nancy in women with HIV as part of the PMTCT coun-
selling service at ANC clinics. The Thai national PMTCT 
guidelines recommend dual methods of contraception 
for HIV-infected women and their partners to avoid unin-
tended pregnancy as recommended by the WHO based 
on studies which show that 14–21% of people who use 
condoms only become pregnant in the first year of use 
[51]. This should include consistent condom use plus 
another form of birth control (e.g. sterilisation, hormo-
nal implant, hormonal injection or intrauterine device). 
Women should also be advised of potential interaction 
between the oral contraceptive pill and ART [42].
The use of dual contraception is low. A recent sur-
vey of PLWHA undertaken mainly in tertiary hospitals 
in Bangkok reported that only 202 (29.6%) of 898 used 
two or more methods of contraception, one of which 
was condoms, 683 (96.3%) used at least one method, 
422 (87.7%) of whom used condom, 37 (7.7%) had been 
sterilised and 765 (82.5%) had disclosed their serosta-
tus to their partner. Female gender and knowledge of 
HIV status for 1–5 or >5 years were associated with dual 
contraception. An intervention of a brief communica-
tion or referral to family planning services caused 66 of 
317 (20.8%) of those who only used one form of contra-
ception to change to dual contraception at a 12-month 
follow-up [52]. To date, no data on national rates of 
unintended pregnancy in HIV-infected women are avail-
able. However, a national reproductive health survey in 
2009 reported that 16.2% of ever-married women aged 
19–49 years had had an unintended last pregnancy [47], 
which is less than the global estimated prevalence (38% 
in the year 2010) [53].
Prong 3: Prevention of HIV transmission from a woman 
living with HIV to her infant and Prong 4: Provision of appro-
priate treatment, care and support to women and children 
living with HIV and their families. Thailand has had great 
success in addressing prongs 3 and 4. In 2015, PHIMS 
data reported 95.6% of HIV-positive pregnant women 
and 99.5% of HIV-infected infants received free WHO 
Option B + through the national PMTCT programme 
[38]. The Thai 2014 national PMTCT guidelines are in 
accordance with WHO recommendations for Prongs 3 
and 4, and these overlap in interventions aimed at them. 
Prong 3 includes testing pregnant women for HIV, pro-
viding HIV-infected pregnant women with ART as soon

funding from multiple domestic sources has been pro-
posed [56]. More interventions are required to encourage 
mothers who are HIV-positive to access post-partum care 
services because 40% do not. The PHIMS monitoring sys-
tem needs to be expanded to include private hospitals 
and large hospitals outside the MOPH system [55].
Conclusion
The prevalence of HIV in pregnant women has decreased 
substantially during the past two decades. MTCT has 
been drastically reduced by early and concerted efforts 
in many sectors. The shared commitment, decision- 
making, resources and efforts by all sectors of Thai society 
to achieve the goals of elimination of MTCT have been 
necessary. The government, NGOs, businesses and Thai 
communities, including community opinion leaders 
and PLWHA, have all played a part in an effective mul-
ti-sectoral response. Leadership has also been required 
because the cost of indecision and delay would be high. 
Every additional HIV-infected child would increase the 
ultimate economic and social cost to the country. Children 
are the future. The country’s response to their problems 
indicates how highly Thailand values its future.
