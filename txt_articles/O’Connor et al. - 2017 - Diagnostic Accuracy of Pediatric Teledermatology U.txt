IMPORTANCE Advances in smartphone photography (both quality and image transmission)
may improve access to care via direct parent-to-clinician telemedicine. However, the accuracy
of diagnoses that are reliant on parent-provided photographs has not been formally
compared with diagnoses made in person.
OBJECTIVE To assess whether smartphone photographs of pediatric skin conditions taken by
parents are of sufficient quality to permit accurate diagnosis.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A prospective study was conducted among 40
patient-parent dyads at a pediatric dermatology clinic at the Children’
s Hospital of
Philadelphia from March 1 to September 30, 2016, to assess concordance between diagnoses
made by an independent pediatric dermatologist based on in-person examination and those
based on parental photographs. Half of the patient-parent dyads were randomized for a
secondary analysis to receive instructions on how best to take photographs with
smartphones. Clinicians were blinded to whether parents had received photography
instructions.
EXPOSURES Half of the patient-parent dyads received a simple, 3-step instruction sheet on
how best to take photographs using a smartphone (intervention group); the other half did
not (control group).
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Concordance between photograph-based vs in-person
diagnosis in the intervention vs control groups, as quantified using Cohen κ, a measure of
interrater agreement that takes into account the possibility of agreement occurring by
chance.
RESULTS Among the 40 patient-parent dyads (22 female children and 18 male children; mean
[SD] age, 6.96 [5.23] years), overall concordance between photograph-based vs in-person
diagnosis was 83% (95% CI, 71%-94%; κ = 0.81). Diagnostic concordance was 89% (95% CI,
75%-97%; κ = 0.88) in a subgroup of 37 participants with photographs considered of high
enough quality to make a diagnosis. No statistically significant effect of photography
instructions on concordance was detected (group that received instructions, 85%; group that
did not receive instructions, 80%; P = .68). In cases of diagnostic disagreement, appropriate
follow-up was suggested.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Parent-operated smartphone photography can accurately be
used as a method to provide pediatric dermatologic care.

 P
ediatric dermatologists are in short supply, with fewer
tthan 300 board-certified physicians serving the
nearly 75 million children in the United States. Fur-
thermore, skin conditions comprise 10% to 30% of nearly
200 million annual pediatric outpatient visits.1-3 Although
many skin conditions can be handled without input from a
subspecialist, one survey revealed that more than 80% of
primary care pediatricians reported that there were too few
pediatric dermatologists to meet the needs of patients in
their practices.4 This deficit of subspecialists results in bar-
riers to accessing care.
In adults, store-and-forward teledermatology has been
shown to improve access to specialty care, consistently pro-
vide accurate diagnosis, and reduce time to treatment, while
achieving high patient satisfaction and cost-effectiveness.5-7
To evaluate pediatric clinician-to-clinician teledermatology,
Heffner et al8 compared pediatric dermatologists’diagnoses
made in person vs using photographs and history taken by a
pediatrician and found an 82% concordance rate. Similarly, in
a retrospective cohort study, Philp et al9 found that pediatric
dermatologists were able to render a diagnosis via photogra-
phy in 75% of cases.
Enhancements in smartphones (eg, optics, storage, en-
cryption, image processing, and data transmission) have made
photographs submitted by parents increasingly viable for
teledermatology diagnosis.10,11 For example, a 2012 study as-
sessing infantile hemangiomas showed that more than 85% of
parent photographs were of sufficiently high quality.12 The
availability of this technology has also greatly increased,
with nearly three-quarters of all adults, and more than 90%
of adults younger than 35 years, now owning a smartphone.13
Pediatric dermatologists also appear to be highly interested in
teledermatology.10
Despite this interest, the accuracy of teledermatology has
not been evaluated specifically for the pediatric population
using photographs taken by parents, to our knowledge. Thus,
our study’
s objective was to evaluate the quality of parent pho-
tography and the concordance between diagnoses made from
in-person and photograph-based examinations. Further-
more, we explored whether a simple instruction sheet pro-
vided to parents would improve image quality and diagnostic
accuracy.
Methods
Study Population
Inclusion criteria consisted of patients being younger than
18 years; new patients or urgent visits in a pediatric derma-
tology practice; and parent with English fluency, smart-
phone ownership, and ability to download the MyChart
application (available on Android and Apple devices; Epic
Systems Corporation). The study protocol in Supplement 1
(NCT03246945) was approved by the Children’
s Hospital of
Philadelphia institutional review board. Parents (or legal
guardians) provided written consent for both themselves and
their children. Written patient assent was obtained when
appropriate.
Study Design
For the primary aim, we used a prospective cohort design to
assess concordance between diagnoses based on in-person ex-
aminationsandthosebasedonparentalphotographs.Afteren-
rollment, the parent took photographs of the child’
s skin con-
dition in the clinic examination room using a personal
smartphone. If the child presented for more than 1 skin con-
dition, the parent was instructed to choose the primary con-
dition. Images were uploaded into the patient’
s electronic
health record securely using the MyChart application, which
the parent downloaded to the smartphone. The parent then
completed a single-page survey to gather basic information
about the child (age, sex, and medical history), the child’
s skin
condition (location, duration, and associated symptoms), and
willingness to use teledermatology. Race and ethnicity were
self-reported. Subsequently, all children were seen in person
by 1 of 2 possible physicians (M.J.P./L.A.C.-S.) for their sched-
uledvisit.Givenvariationinphotographquality(lighting,num-
ber of pictures taken, and patient compliance), a simple, 3-step
instruction sheet on smartphone photography was devel-
oped (eTable in Supplement 2).
For the secondary aim, we embedded a 2-arm, parallel-
group randomized trial within the cohort to assess the effect
of the photography instructions on the in-person photograph-
basedvsexamination-baseddiagnoses.Onenrollment,thepa-
tient-parent dyad was randomly assigned to the study arm (in-
struction sheet provided) or the control arm (no instruction
sheet provided). Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner
using simple, sequential allocation without stratification. Gen-
eration of the allocation sequence occurred before enroll-
ment. A clinical investigator assigned participants using this
sequence during participant enrollment. We estimated that a
sample size of 40 patients would yield 80% power to detect a
difference of 1 point in the photograph quality rating scale
(PQRS) score between the 2 groups, assuming α = .05, and nor-
mally distributed data with a variance of 2.5 for both groups.
All photographs were evaluated using the PQRS based on
the following 5 criteria: clarity, perspective, darkness, bright-
ness, and color (eFigure in Supplement 2). Each criterion was
rated on an integer scale from 0 to 2, yielding a total score rang-
ing from 0 (lowest quality) to 10 (highest quality). The teleder-
matology physician was given only the photographs and
basic survey information and was asked to make a diagnosis.
Diagnoses were considered concordant if the same diagnosis
Key Points
Question Can parent-provided smartphone photographs be used
for the diagnosis of pediatric skin conditions?
Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 40 patient-parent
dyads, overall concordance between photograph-based vs
in-person diagnosis was 83%. Concordance was 89% in a
subgroup of 37 cases with photographs considered of high enough
quality to make a diagnosis.
Meaning Parent-provided smartphone photographs are typically
of sufficient quality to permit accurate diagnosis of pediatric skin
conditions.

 was provided by the in-person physician and the telederma-
tologist and considered discordant if a different diagnosis was
provided by the 2 physicians.
Statistical Analysis
Baseline and demographic characteristics were summarized
bystandarddescriptivesummaries(eg,meansandSDsforcon-
tinuous variables, such as age, and percentages for categori-
cal variables, such as sex). The Mann-Whitney test was used
to compare the image quality and the number of images taken
between groups. Rates of concordance were expressed using
percentages and the Cohen κ coefficient and were compared
between groups using the χ2 test. Logistic regression was used
to determine whether sample characteristics influenced con-
cordance, and multilevel mixed-effects ordered logistic re-
gression was used to determine whether sample characteris-
tics influenced image quality. Individual images (level 1) were
nested in cases (level 2) for the multilevel image quality model.
Sample characteristics (fixed effects) in these models in-
cluded patient age, patient sex, smartphone age, smartphone
operatingsystem,whetherphotographicinstructionswerepro-
vided, diagnostic category, and number of photographs taken.
Mean PQRS score and number of photos taken were also in-
cluded as fixed effects in the concordance models. Analyses
wereperformedusingStata,version13.1(StataCorpLP).P < .05
(2-sided) was considered statistically significant.
Results
Sample Characteristics
Forty-eight patient-parent dyads were invited to participate in
this study, with 40 completing the study protocol between
March 1 and September 30, 2016 (Figure). New enrollment was
ended when target numbers were reached. Failure to com-
plete the protocol occurred with technical issues (eg, inabil-
ity to download the application or upload photographs) and
time constraints. Twenty dyads were randomly assigned to the
study arm (instruction sheet provided) and 20 dyads were as-
signed to the control arm (no instruction sheet provided). Our
sample represented a wide range of ages (mean [SD] age, 6.96
[5.23] years) and both sexes approximately equally (Table 1).
Most parents (25 [63%]) used a version of the Apple iPhone 5
or 6. The remainder of parents used smartphones running the
Android operating system, with 10 (25%) using a version of the
Samsung Galaxy and 5 (13%) using LG, Google, or HTC smart-
phones. All smartphone cameras used by parents had at least
an 8-megapixel resolution, none was more than 4 years old,
and more than two-thirds were less than 2 years old. The di-
agnoses rendered in this study by the in-person dermatolo-
gist, along with the diagnostic category by which they were
grouped, are listed in Table 2.
Image Quality Analysis
Our study included 87 images from the 40 patients. The me-
dian PQRS score was 9 of 10. No sample characteristics (ie, pa-
tient age, patient sex, smartphone age, or smartphone oper-
atingsystem)hadasignificanteffectonimagequalityaccording

 representingnotaltered),whilethelowestcomponentwasclar-
ity, the criterion evaluating photograph blurriness (only 37
[43%] received a score of 2, representing in focus).
Diagnostic Concordance
Overall concordance between photograph-based vs in-
person diagnosis was 83% (95% CI, 71%-94%; κ = 0.81). Of the
40 dyads’photographs, 3 diagnoses were unable to be pro-
vided by the remote dermatologist owing to poor photograph
quality. Diagnostic concordance was 89% (95% CI, 75%-97%;
κ = 0.88) in the subgroup of 37 dyads with photographs con-
sideredofhighenoughqualitytomakeadiagnosis.Imagequal-
ity differed significantly based on whether or not a diagnosis
could be provided (mean PQRS score with diagnosis ren-
dered, 8.9; mean score with no diagnosis, 7.0; P = .001). Di-
agnostic accuracy varied by diagnostic category (Table 2). For
example, the concordance for birthmarks was 100%, 92% for
rashes, and 64% for alopecia-related diagnoses. Of the 4 cases
that were misdiagnosed, there were 3 cases of alopecia and 1
nodule (Table 3). Concordance did not vary by demographic
or other sample characteristics (ie, patient age, patient sex,
smartphone age, smartphone operating system, or number of
photographs taken).
Effect of Providing Photography Instructions
Half of the parents participating in the study received instruc-
tions for taking high-quality images (eTable in Supplement 2).
The group with instructions had increased average image
quality and mean number of images provided by each parent,
althoughthesetrendsdidnotreachstatisticalsignificance.Pro-
viding instructions significantly increased the quality of the
best image submitted by each parent, a metric that takes into
account both individual image quality and number of images
taken (mean PQRS score with instructions, 9.5; mean score
without instructions, 8.9; P = .04). No statistical difference in
diagnostic concordance was seen for dyads who were pro-
vided photographic instructions (85%) compared with those
in the group who did not receive instructions, including cases
in which no diagnosis could be made (80%; P = .68).
Parental Willingness to Use Teledermatology
Parents were asked to rate their willingness to use a teleder-
matology application to communicate with a pediatric der-
matologist at our institution rather than wait for an in-person
appointment. On a scale of 1 (not willing) to 10 (very willing),
the median response was 8 and the mode was 10. Parents were
also asked to select the price they would be willing to pay for
a virtual visit from a list ranging from $0 to $200 in $20 incre-
ments. Most respondents (32 [80%]) were willing to pay to use
the application, with a median price of $20 (range, $0-$160).
Discussion
Our study shows that, in most cases, parents can take photo-
graphs of sufficient quality to allow for accurate telederma-
tology diagnoses of pediatric skin conditions. Our results
are consistent with previous literature studying telederma-
tology in adults showing concordance between primary care
teledermatology consultations and in-person dermatologist
diagnoses.5,14-18 Our study also demonstrated potential for use
of teledermatology as triage in a pediatric setting. For ex-
ample, urgent dermatology clinic follow-up was recom-
mended in cases of infantile hemangiomas that presented on
the lower lip and upper eyelid, whereas reassurance was sug-
gested for a hemangioma that presented on the calf.
Diagnostic accuracy varied by diagnostic category. When
dealing with categories with low concordance, such as alope-
ciaandnodulesandtumors,teledermatologypractitionersmay
need to be cautious about attempting definitive diagnoses in
some cases and may need to refer patients for in-person con-
sultation. For these cases, teledermatology may still serve as
a triage tool. For example, patients with suspicious nodules

 could be referred for expedited appointments in specialty clin-
ics, whereas patients with isolated alopecia could be sched-
uledforroutinevisits.Conversely,indiagnosticcategorieswith
highconcordance,suchasbirthmarksandrashes,certaincases
could be definitively diagnosed and treated exclusively using
teledermatology (eg, mild acne).
The greatest number of incorrect diagnoses occurred in
cases of alopecia, likely because such diagnoses can be diffi-
cult to differentiate without dermoscopy and a thorough his-
tory. In 2 misdiagnosed cases of alopecia, the correct diagnosis
couldhavebeenrenderedwithasmallamountofadditionalhis-
tory screening for trichotillosis. Unlike the standard paper in-
take forms used in this study, mobile applications could adapt
questions based on specific diagnoses and patient input, much
likethewaythatskilledclinicianstailortheirhistorytakingbased
on the particular patient, responses to previous questions, and
differentialdiagnosis.Inaddition,mobileapplicationscouldin-
tegrate features, such as secure text messaging, to allow asyn-
chronous, or even real-time, communication with patients.
Because 1 of the 2 in-person clinicians specializes in pe-
diatric hair conditions, our study included an above-average
proportion of such cases. Given the disproportionately large
number of cases of alopecia, as well as the inability of the tele-
medicine clinician to ask additional questions or request more
photos, our study likely underestimates the potential pediat-
ric teledermatology diagnostic concordance rate. Further-
more,sincepatientswerealreadybeingseenbyapediatricder-
matologist and parents knew that the photographs taken for
this study would not affect their child’
s diagnoses and treat-
ments, they may not have been as diligent with photograph
quality compared with parents using a teledermatology
application from home when their child’
s care depends on
image quality.
Although diagnostic concordance was higher in the group
that received instructions, this improvement did not reach sta-
tistical significance. This trend should be investigated fur-
ther in a larger study, as this one was likely underpowered to
detect an effect given the low number of incorrectly diag-
nosed cases. Nevertheless, including similar instructions may
be useful in future teledermatology services. In recent years,
the utility of patient photography instructions may have be-
comesomewhatreducedowingtomodernuser-friendlysmart-
phone design, which maximizes image quality regardless of
userability;thisdesignincludesstandardfeaturessuchashigh-
resolution image sensors and high-quality lenses, as well as so-
phisticated lighting, image stabilization, and focusing algo-
rithms. Furthermore, while the instructions discussed optimal
lighting, most parental photographs were taken in the well-
lit clinic examination room. Future studies should be per-
formed using real-life conditions to assess diagnostic concor-
dance and other aspects of care.
Although this study simulated rather than performed an
actual teledermatology encounter, our findings contribute to
the large body of literature that supports the potential of
teledermatology to provide quality care. Direct-to-patient pe-
diatric teledermatology could also improve access for pa-
tients whose families face geographic, scheduling, or finan-
cial limitations19 and could reduce wait times. Our survey
indicated parent enthusiasm about using a pediatric teleder-
matology application if one were available rather than wait-
ing for an in-person appointment. Most parents were willing
to pay an amount similar to, or in excess of, the cost of their
visit copayment for the service.
We agree with recent recommendations that telemedi-
cine is best performed by physicians who are part of a pa-
tient’
s medical home or health system.19-21 When a teleder-
matology diagnosis is uncertain or requires further
management, there must be a system in place to facilitate ap-
propriate follow-up with the patient’
s primary clinician, der-
matologist, or other specialists. Without the opportunity for
in-person follow-up, patients may not receive accurate diag-
noses when teledermatology is insufficient, may be sent to
emergency departments, or may not receive further care at all.
Providing care integrated into local health networks also
enables clinicians practicing telemedicine to view a patient’
s
existing medical record and readily communicate with the pa-
tient’
s established medical professionals. In our study, addi-
tional history that could have been gleaned from the elec-
tronic health record may have allowed for more accurate
diagnoses. Being part of a local network would also allow tele-
medicine clinicians to order diagnostic studies or laboratory
testsandprescribemedicationswhilepreventingsiloedorfrag-
mented care by integrating directly into patient records.
Limitations
Limitations of our study included the small sample size; a set-
tingthatwasurban,academic,andclinicbased;anduseofonly
1 pediatric dermatologist to provide remote diagnoses. The
small sample size may have limited our ability to show an ef-
fect from providing instructions. The clinic-based setting may
have altered factors such as lighting, among others. The ur-
ban academic setting and single physician providing remote
diagnoses may make our findings less generalizable.
Conclusions
Parents can reliably take high-quality photographs of their
child’
s skin condition using smartphone cameras. This find-
ing suggests that direct-to-patient pediatric teledermatology
should not be limited by image quality, especially when ap-
propriate photography instructions are provided.
