STUDY OBJECTIVE No clinical trials are currently available that demonstrate the effects of marijuana on
patients with migraine headache; however, the potential effects of cannabinoids on serotonin in the
central nervous system indicate that marijuana may be a therapeutic alternative. Thus, the objective
of this study was to describe the effects of medical marijuana on the monthly frequency of migraine
headache.
DESIGN Retrospective chart review.
SETTING Two medical marijuana specialty clinics in Colorado.
PATIENTS One hundred twenty-one adults with the primary diagnosis of migraine headache who were
recommended migraine treatment or prophylaxis with medical marijuana by a physician, between
January 2010 and September 2014, and had at least one follow-up visit.
MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS The primary outcome was number of migraine headaches per month with
medical marijuana use. Secondary outcomes were the type and dose of medical marijuana used, pre-
vious and adjunctive migraine therapies, and patient-reported effects. Migraine headache frequency
decreased from 10.4 to 4.6 headaches per month (p<0.0001) with the use of medical marijuana.
Most patients used more than one form of marijuana and used it daily for prevention of migraine
headache. Positive effects were reported in 48 patients (39.7%), with the most common effects
reported being prevention of migraine headache with decreased frequency of migraine headache (24
patients [19.8%]) and aborted migraine headache (14 patients [11.6%]). Inhaled forms of marijuana
were commonly used for acute migraine treatment and were reported to abort migraine headache.
Negative effects were reported in 14 patients (11.6%); the most common effects were somnolence (2
patients [1.7%]) and difficulty controlling the effects of marijuana related to timing and intensity of
the dose (2 patients [1.7%]), which were experienced only in patients using edible marijuana. Edi-
ble marijuana was also reported to cause more negative effects compared with other forms.
CONCLUSION The frequency of migraine headache was decreased with medical marijuana use. Prospec-
tive studies should be conducted to explore a cause-and-effect relationship and the use of different
strains, formulations, and doses of marijuana to better understand the effects of medical marijuana
on migraine headache treatment and prophylaxis.

 D9-tetrahydrocannabinol
(THC).
Cannabidiol
(CBD) is another common CB, which accounts
for 40% of the plant’s extract and is one of the
primary constituents of medical marijuana.1
Phytocannabinoids are CBs that occur natu-
rally in the plant (e.g., THC, CBD) and stimulate
CB receptors throughout the body.2 The body
contains endogenous CBs and receptors, which
make
up
the
endocannabinoid
system.
This
system is responsible for maintaining homeosta-
sis in our bodies. Research has found that the
endocannabinoid system might be a target for
treatment of diseases such as migraine headache
(HA), fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, and irrita-
ble bowel syndrome.3 The endocannabinoid sys-
tem is common throughout the central nervous
system and has presence in peripheral tissues as
well. This system includes CB receptors, CB1
and CB2, and ligands such as anandamide (AEA)
and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), which are
located
throughout
the
brain
and
influence
many regulatory systems.4 Cannabinoid1 recep-
tors are widely expressed in the central and
peripheral nervous system. In the central ner-
vous system, activation of CB1 receptors leads to
inhibition of the following neurotransmitters:
c-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate, sero-
tonin, dopamine, acetylcholine, norepinephrine,
cholecystokinin, and D-aspartate.5 Cannabinoid2
receptors are widely expressed throughout the
peripheral tissues, especially the immune system,
and have antiinflammatory properties and anal-
gesic effects. Anandamide is a partial agonist at
CB receptors and binds to CB1 receptors with
higher affinity than CB2 receptors. Anandamide
has been shown to have inhibitory effects on
serotonin type 3 (5-hydroxytryptamine [HT]3)
receptors, further suggesting its antiemetic and
analgesic roles.5 It is also a 5-HT1A receptor ago-
nist and a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist.
D9-Tetrahydrocannabinol acts as a partial ago-
nist at CB1 and CB2 receptors and is structurally
similar to endogenous AEA. Cannabidiol antago-
nizes CB1 receptors at low levels in the presence
of THC and acts as a potent analgesic. The
mechanisms of CBs have been examined and
suggest serotonergic and dopaminergic effects as
well as providing antiinflammatory effects. Evi-
dence suggests that THC affects serotonin and
dopamine by inhibiting serotonin release from
platelets, stimulates 5-HT synthesis, and modu-
lates dopaminergic imbalances.3 Specific condi-
tions such as Alzheimer’s disease and depression
occur due to a lack of neurotransmitters.6 As a
result, it has been hypothesized that patients
with central nervous system disorders might
have a clinical endocannabinoid deficiency. Fur-
ther evidence from one study6 reported reduced
levels of AEA in the cerebrospinal fluid of
patients
with
migraine
HA.
As
a
result
of
reduced AEA levels, the trigeminovascular sys-
tem is activated, resulting in a migraine HA.
The role of serotonin in migraine HA is sup-
ported by the efficacy of serotonin agonists such
as triptans for acute treatment of migraine.
Other agents used for acute migraine treatment
include
nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory
drugs,
acetaminophen, and antiemetic agents. In addi-
tion to acute migraine treatment, the American
Academy of Neurology 2012 guidelines recom-
mend pharmacologic agents for preventive ther-
apy.7
Level
A
treatment
recommendations
include certain antiepileptic drugs, b-blockers,
and triptans. Current guidelines do not address
the use of cannabis for the prevention or treat-
ment of migraine HA; however, the potential
effects of CBs on serotonin in the central ner-
vous system make it possible that cannabis
could be a therapeutic alternative.5
Although there are no clinical trials available,
to our knowledge, demonstrating the effects of
marijuana on patients with migraine HA, five
case reports described patients who used dron-
abinol with or without additional marijuana
products
for
treatment
of
their
vascular
or
migraine HAs and who experienced an overall
decrease in migraine HA.8 These case reports,
however, lack scientific rigor and consistent
reporting and do not provide detailed informa-
tion about the positive or negative impact of
marijuana.
Due to a lack of data on the efficacy and pro-
posed mechanism of the pharmacologic benefit
of medical marijuana in patients with migraine
HA, clinical data describing the effectiveness of
medical marijuana for the frequency of migraine
HA
are
necessary.
Other
useful
information
would include the dose and type of medical
marijuana being used and other clinical effects
of marijuana. Thus, the primary purpose of this
study was to determine the monthly frequency
of migraine HA in
patients diagnosed with
migraine HA who used medical marijuana.
Methods
Study Design, Setting, and Outcomes
This was a retrospective, observational chart
review of patients who were seen at Gedde
506
PHARMACOTHERAPY Volume 36, Number 5, 2016
 Whole Health, a private medical practice with
offices located in Colorado Springs and Buena
Vista, Colorado. The physician in these clinics
specializes in applications of medical marijuana
for various conditions and makes recommenda-
tions to patients for the use of medical mari-
juana when a patient has a qualifying medical
condition based on state requirements. This
study was approved by the Colorado Multiple
Institutional Review Board.
The
primary
outcome
of
this
study
was
monthly frequency of migraine HA with medical
marijuana use. Secondary outcomes were type
and dose of medical marijuana used, previous
and adjunctive migraine therapies, and patient-
reported effects.
Patient Chart Identification and Data Collection
Charts for adult patients, aged 18–89 years
old, with a primary diagnosis of migraine HA
and at least one follow-up visit were included
for review. Data were extracted by a single
investigator
for
consistency.
Data
collection
included sex, number of years with migraine
HA, medical history, previous migraine therapy,
adjunctive
migraine
therapy,
number
of
migraine HAs per month, types and doses of
marijuana, frequency of marijuana use, number
of migraine HAs per month at the follow-up
visit, and patient-reported effects. Number of
migraine HAs experienced each month and the
amount of marijuana used each month were
patient-reported data. Medical marijuana quanti-
ties were reported in ounces, with the excep-
tion
of
edible
dosage
forms,
which
were
reported in milligrams. Edible doses were then
converted to ounces per month based on a cal-
culation
of
100 mg/day
of
edible
marijuana
being considered equivalent to 1 oz/month of
cannabis flower. This conversion was based on
an approximated potency of CB in cannabis
flower used by study patients of 10% (w/w),
based on historical and contemporary data.9 If
CB potency in cannabis flower is approximated
at 10% (w/w), then 1 g of cannabis flower con-
tains 0.1 g (or 100 mg) of CB. Given that 1 oz
equals
28 g,
and
1 month
is
approximately
30 days,
then
1 oz/month
is
approximately
28 g/30 days, or approximately 1 g/day. Then
1 oz/month of cannabis flower roughly equals
1 g/day
of
cannabis
flower,
which
converts
approximately to 100 mg/day of CB. The CB
conversion used is illustrated in the following
equation:
No.of ounces/month�(no.of milligrams/day)=100
When ranges of doses were reported (e.g.,
1–2 oz/month), the highest dose of medical mar-
ijuana was documented.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe
demographic and clinical data. The mean and
standard
deviation,
median
and
interquartile
range, and proportions were calculated for nor-
mally distributed data, nonparametric data, and
nominal data, respectively. Two-tailed paired t
tests were used when possible; a p value less
than 0.05 was considered to indicate a statisti-
cally significant difference. All statistical tests
were
performed
using
GraphPad
software
(GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA).
Results
All patient visits with dates between January
1,
2010,
and
September
30,
2014,
were
screened, and 262 patient charts with a primary
diagnosis of migraine HA were identified. Of
these, 121 had at least one follow-up visit
recorded and were eligible for inclusion. The
other 141 patient charts were excluded due to
the absence of a follow-up visit.
The initial visit characteristics for the 121
included patients are shown in Table 1. Fifty-
two percent of patients were female, and the
average duration of migraine HA was 14 years.
Eighty-two (67.8%) patients had a history of
previous or current marijuana use at the initial
visit. Follow-up visit characteristics are also
shown in Table 1.
The primary outcome of mean number of
migraine HAs per month at the initial and fol-
low-up visits were 10.4 and 4.6 (p<0.0001),
respectively. The mean time between the initial
and most recent follow-up visit was 21.8 months
(range
12–37 mo).
A
total
of
103
patients
(85.1%) reported a decrease in frequency of
migraine
HAs
per
month.
Alternatively,
15
patients (12.4%) reported the same number of
HAs per month, and 3 (2.5%) had an increase in
the number of HAs per month. More than half
of the patients (62 [51.2%]) reported using two
or more forms of marijuana for migraine HA
treatment and/or prophylaxis at the follow-up
visit. The forms of medical marijuana used
included vaporized (42 patients), edible (66

507
 patients), topical (15 patients), and smoked (65
patients). Follow-up visit mean monthly doses
of each type of marijuana were 2.64 oz, 2.59 oz,
2.73 oz, and 1.59 oz for vaporized, edible, topi-
cal, and smoked forms, respectively. Reasons for
use of medical marijuana included migraine HA
prophylaxis (7
patients),
acute
treatment
of
migraine HA (4 patients), or both (110 patients).
A post-hoc sample size calculation was per-
formed by using PASS 14 (NCSS Statistical Soft-
ware; NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, UT) to ensure the
internal validity of these results. This analysis
yielded a necessary sample size of 96 patients to
achieve 80% power when the mean population
difference in number of migraine headaches per
month was 5.8 and the standard deviation for
both groups was 10.0, which was exceeded in
our study with a sample size of 121 patients.
Migraine HA prescription drug therapy was
reported in 59 (48.8%) patients, with the aver-
age
number
of
medications
being
1.15
per
patient at the initial visit. At the follow-up visit,
52 (42.9%) patients reported using migraine HA
drug therapy in addition to medical marijuana.
The average number of migraine HA medications
was 1.09 per patient; however, the difference
between the number of medications at the initial
and follow-up visits was not statistically signifi-
cant (p=0.22). There were 62 patient-reported
effects, illustrated in Tables 2 and 3. Positive
effects were recorded for 48 patients, with half
(24 patients) of the effects being reported as pre-
vention of migraine HA with decreased fre-
quency
of
migraine
HA
(Table 2).
These
beneficial effects were reported for all forms of
marijuana. In addition, migraine abortion was
the second most common positive effect (14
patients). Negative patient-reported effects are
shown in Table 3 (n=14). Patients who used the
edible form (11 patients) were most likely to
report negative effects, which included somno-
lence (2 patients) and difficulty controlling the
effects of marijuana, including when the effects
would occur and the intensity of effects (2
patients).
Discussion
This study is one of the first to reveal that
migraine HA frequency decreased in patients
using medical marijuana, and the difference in
frequency between the initial and follow-up visit
was statistically significant (p<0.0001). Further,
90% of patients used marijuana for both treat-
ment and prophylaxis of migraine HA. More
than half of the patients at the follow-up visit
reported using two or more delivery methods of
marijuana for migraine HA treatment, which
demonstrates that some delivery methods might
be
preferred
for
abortive
treatment
versus
migraine
HA
prevention.
For
example,
12
patients
reported
migraine
abortion
success
while using an inhaled form of marijuana. This
effect was likely due to the quick onset of action
with inhaled marijuana as opposed to a slower
onset of action with an edible form. Although
there were more overall positive effects reported,
there were more negative reports for the edible
form of marijuana, likely due to variability of
onset of action. As previous research has shown,
the pharmacokinetics of the edible forms are
variable, and it could take up to 4 hours to
reach peak THC concentration, with clinical
effects lasting longer (e.g., up to 8 hrs).10, 11
These pharmacokinetic factors likely led to the
reported difficulty in controlling the effects of
marijuana.
This study has some limitations. First, the ret-
rospective nature of the study limits the ability
to evaluate the causality of the use of medical
marijuana and decrease in migraine HA fre-
quency, and it does not allow for controlling the

 type of dose used. This study showed a reduc-
tion in migraine HA frequency with the use of
medical marijuana; however, it demonstrates the
need
for
performing
additional
studies
in
patients with migraine HA to explore the bene-
fits and risks of medical marijuana in a con-
trolled environment. Second, more than half of
the patients with migraine did not have a fol-
low-up visit and were excluded from the study.
The effects of marijuana are unknown for these
patients, and medical follow-up was no longer
required in Colorado with the legalization of
marijuana in January 2014. Third, chart docu-
mentation
was
not
consistent
across
every
patient. For instance, documentation of clinical
effects appeared for only half of the patients.
Specific directions for use of medical marijuana
were not recorded in the charts. In addition,
most patients reported previous use of marijuana
at the initial visit; however, the duration of pre-
vious
use
was
unknown.
Given
that
most
patients had used marijuana prior to the initial
visit, this study suggests that interaction with a
provider may improve how prior or current
marijuana use can be optimized to improve
symptoms. Documentation revealed that most
patients used marijuana daily; however, it is
unknown
if
some
patients
used
marijuana
multiple times per day. Fifty-two patients used
preventive and/or abortive pharmacologic agents
for migraine HA in addition to medical mari-
juana, but the frequency of their use was not
documented. Also, information on the strains
and/or amounts of CBs within medical mari-
juana
products
was
not
consistently
docu-
mented, so this information was unable to be
collected.
The ideal study design to further investigate
the effects of medical marijuana on the fre-
quency of migraine HA would be a randomized,
placebo-controlled clinical trial with a marijuana
washout period prior to study start. The ideal
study would also provide participants with stan-
dardized quantities and potencies of medical
marijuana while tracking their adherence, num-
ber of migraine HAs, and adverse effects in a
systematic
fashion
analogous
to
that
of
a
prescription drug study. Based on current federal
regulations regarding research of this type and
lack of consistency among cannabis and canna-
bis compounds, substantial changes in legisla-
tion and product manufacturing would need to
occur before a study with this scientific rigor
could feasibly be performed.

 migraine HA and using marijuana, this chart
review provided some insight about key mes-
sages for patients. For example, providers need
to be prepared to discuss potential benefits and
risks of marijuana use. In addition, given the
difference in strains, doses, and formulations, it
may be difficult to establish a standardized dos-
ing schedule, and marijuana use should be accu-
rately documented. Edible formulations have a
longer
onset
of
action
and
variable
patient
responses, so patients should be advised to start
with a low dose, carefully monitor response, and
titrate slowly, if needed. Use of prescription and
over-the-counter medications for migraine HA
should also be documented to optimize medica-
tion use.
Conclusion
Patients using medical marijuana for migraine
HA reported a statistically significant decrease in
the number of migraine HAs per month. Almost
all patients used marijuana daily for migraine
HA prevention. Inhaled forms of marijuana were
commonly used for acute migraine treatment
and were reported to abort migraine HA. Over-
all, more positive than negative effects were
reported with medical marijuana use. Edible
marijuana was reported to cause more negative
effects
compared
with
other
forms.
Further
research should be performed to determine if
there is a preferred delivery method, dose, and
strain of medical marijuana for migraine HA
therapy as well as the potential long-term effects
of medical marijuana.
