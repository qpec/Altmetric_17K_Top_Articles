ABSTRACT
Background The prime focus of research on sports
injury has been on physical factors. This is despite our
understanding that when an athlete sustains an injury it
has psychosocial as well as physical impacts.
Psychosocial factors have been suggested as prognostic
influences on the outcomes of rehabilitation. The aim of
this work was to address the question: are psychosocial
factors associated with sports injury rehabilitation
outcomes in competitive athletes?
Study design Mixed studies systematic review
(PROSPERO reg.CRD42014008667).
Method Electronic database and bibliographic
searching was undertaken from the earliest entry until 1
June 2015. Studies that included injured competitive
athletes, psychosocial factors and a sports injury
rehabilitation outcome were reviewed by the authors.
A quality appraisal of the studies was undertaken to
establish the risk of reporting bias.
Results 25 studies were evaluated that included 942
injured competitive athletes were appraised and
synthesised. Twenty studies had not been included in
previous reviews. The mean methodological quality of
the studies was 59% (moderate risk of reporting bias).
Convergent thematic analysis uncovered three core
themes across the studies: (1) emotion associated with
rehabilitation outcomes; (2) cognitions associated with
rehabilitation outcomes; and (3) behaviours associated
with rehabilitation outcomes. Injury and performance-
related fears, anxiety and confidence were associated
with rehabilitation outcomes. There is gender-related,
age-related and injury-related bias in the reviewed
literature.
Conclusions Psychosocial factors were associated with
a range of sports injury rehabilitation outcomes.
Practitioners need to recognise that an injured athlete’s
thoughts, feelings and actions may influence the
outcome of rehabilitation.
INTRODUCTION
The prime focus of research on sports injuries has
been on physical factors.1 This is despite our
understanding that when an athlete sustains a
sports injury it has psychosocial impacts.2
3 A
common assumption has been that physical and
psychosocial recovery occurs at the same time.
Recently, it has been recognised that physical and
psychological readiness to return to sport after
injury do not always coincide.4 This means that
athletes may return to training and competition
when they are physically but not psychologically
ready.
Many athletes do not return to their preinjury
level of activity, and even less return to competi-
tion.5 6 Competitive athletes may be less likely to
return to a preinjury level of performance than rec-
reational athletes.6 As rehabilitation takes place
within social contexts involving many people, a key
to effective rehabilitation may lie with psychosocial
factors.7 Psychosocial factors can be described as
‘pertaining to the influence of social factors on an
individual’s mind or behaviour, and to the interrela-
tion of behaviour and social factors’.8 These factors
have been identified as being important prognostic
influences in a range of sports pathologies.5 9–11
Psychosocial factors are also present within a
number of models that have been applied or devel-
oped within this area.2 12 13 These draw on stage-
based,
cognitive
appraisal
or
biopsychosocial
approaches and give a conceptual framework to
work from, although no single approach predomi-
nates the evidence.4
Three major systematic reviews have been pub-
lished within this area.14–16 These have addressed
the need for transparency, methodological rigour
and non-biased perspectives in reporting the empir-
ical evidence.17 Of the three reviews, two are exclu-
sively focused on psychosocial factors influencing
anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) rehabilitation.15 16
While ACL injury has high personal impact,18 this
represents a narrow perspective and precludes any
generalisation
of
the
findings.
To
reduce
injury-related bias there is a need to include other
injuries which have the same prevalence, severity
and chronicity (eg, high-grade lateral ankle sprain,
rotator cuff tendinopathy). All of these reviews
agree that psychosocial factors influence rehabilita-
tion outcomes. However, differences in constructs
were
apparent
across
the
reviews.
Prominent
factors highlighted in these reviews include motiv-
ation, self-efficacy, perceived control;15 autonomy,
relatedness, competence;14 and affect, cognition,
and behaviours.16
These reviews report only quantitative research
designs
despite
the
existence
of
peer-reviewed
qualitative empirical studies. Previous reviews that
have excluded qualitative research have reduced the
evidence on which they base their findings. There
is recognition of the need for systematic method-
ologies to rigorously deal with diverse forms of evi-
dence to address the disparity between academic
research and practitioner experience.19 Integrating
statistical generalisation with the in-depth descrip-
tion of complex phenomena gleaned from qualita-
tive research has the potential to provide a detailed,
rich and highly practical understanding of sport

 injury rehabilitation. Assessing the overall contribution of a
body of literature with contrasting paradigms and designs can be
more relevant to clinical decision-making.20
The aim of this review was to examine the association
between psychosocial factors and sports injury rehabilitation
outcomes. This aim was underpinned by the research question:
are psychosocial factors associated with sports injury rehabilita-
tion outcomes in competitive athletes?
METHOD
The methodology of our systematic review was informed by the
PRISMA guidelines17 and recommendations by Lloyd-Jones.21
W
e prospectively registered with PROSPERO in February 2014
(registration number: CRD42014008667), and our systematic
review was granted ethical approval by the institutional ethics
committee (ref: DF/08/09/2014/01).
Search strategy
Eight
databases
were
searched
on
1
June
2015
(ie,
SPORTDiscus,
CINAHL,
AMED,
MEDLINE,
PsychINFO,
SocIndex, PEDro, ScienceDirect) using multiple keywords and
Boolean phrases (table 1). The search terms were agreed a priori
and informed by breaking down the research question, relevant
MeSH terms and by the biopsychosocial approaches used in the
area.2 13 Extracted studies were included or excluded in a three-
step screening process studying based on title, abstract and full
text.21 W
e searched the reference lists of included studies using
the same process.
Eligibility criteria
The eligibility criteria are presented in table 2. There was no
restriction on date of publication, gender, age or level of per-
formance. Each study had to conform to best practice defini-
tions of sports injury22 23 and competitive athlete, containing
discernible psychosocial factors2
13 influencing sports injury
rehabilitation outcomes.24
25 Studies of non-musculoskeletal
(MSK) injury, such as concussion, were excluded based on spe-
cific psychopathology directly effecting neurocognitive function.
It is difficult to separate out the psychological consequences
associated with the injury pathology from the more interpretive
psychosocial responses of athletes.26
Assessment of risk of bias
To assess the methodological quality of the literature the mixed
methods appraisal tool (MMAT) was used.20 Additional to
generic criteria the MMAT has five sets of quality criteria
relating to: (1) qualitative; (2) quantitative—randomised con-
trolled studies; (3) quantitative—non-randomised controlled
studies; (4) quantitative—observational descriptive studies and
(5) mixed-methods studies. The overall quality score for each
study was based on the methodological domain-specific criteria
using a percentage-based calculation. Mixed methods studies
were quality assessed within its own domain plus the domain/s
used by its quantitative and qualitative components. According
to the MMAT
, for mixed methods studies the overall research
quality cannot exceed the quality of its weakest component. The
MMAT in this review was used to provide an informative
description of overall quality and to assess the potential for bias
in the findings. Literature using the MMAT has found that the
consistency of the global ‘quality score’ between reviewers (ICC)
was between 0.72 and 0.94.20
Data synthesis
The first step of data synthesis was indwelling,27 where the
reviewers read the full text of each study and became immersed
in the findings and inferences. Studies were then placed into
three tables for the review (1) demographic characteristics, (2)
study summary, (3) study quality appraisal. Convergent thematic
analysis was used to synthesise data from different empirical
findings and the assessment of methodological quality.28 A
meta-aggregative approach was adopted. Meta-analysis was not
conducted due to the heterogeneity within the included studies
research designs.
Establishing rigour
To ensure rigour, a peer review team was formed. The team
comprised of the lead researcher (DF), a professor from the
same institution (AS) and an academic from another University
(AG). This team was created to minimise bias and human error.
Established methods of peer debrief and use of ‘devil’s advocate’
were used to inform the reviews search strategy, records screen-
ing and generation of final themes from the included studies.27
The full text assessment of eligibility and quality appraisal was
undertaken collaboratively in working meetings. These were
chaired by the lead researcher with borderline cases or conten-
tious issues resolved through group discussion until a consensus
was reached. Eligibility of final studies was carried out using a
voting system to determine the basis for study inclusion or
exclusion. Decisions to include or exclude studies were based on
majority
voting.

RESULTS
Literature identification
The electronic database search yielded 368 records. An add-
itional 92 records were identified through systematic biblio-
graphic searching (figure 1). Titles and abstracts of 432 records
were screened following removal of duplicate records (n=28),
and 368 records were excluded. W
e subsequently obtained and
screened 64 studies in full text, and 39 were excluded. One
study29 was referred by the team to the chair of the faculty’s
ethics committee for advice and later included. Finally 25
studies were included for systematic review (figure 1). Table 3
identifies the rating for each of the final studies as a marker of
agreement for inclusion by the research team (eg, for full agree-
ment three stars were awarded).
Assessment of risk of bias
The methodological quality of included studies was assessed
using the MMAT and decisions agreed by the team. Fourteen
studies were assessed against qualitative criteria, five studies
against
quantitative
(non-randomised)
criteria,
four
studies
against quantitative (descriptive) criteria, and two against mixed
methods criteria (table 3). The methodological quality of the 25
studies varied between 25 and 75% (mean 59%). Qualitative
studies scored highest for quality (mean 64%, range 25–75%),
compared to quantitative studies (mean 55.5%, range 25–75%)
and mixed methods (mean 37.5%, range 25–50%). Although
the MMAT does not state specific thresholds for quality level it
was agreed by the team in line with previous systematic
reviews14 16 54 that there was a moderate to high risk of report-
ing bias.
Demographic characteristics
The 25 included studies reported on 942 injured athletes, aged
15–37 years (mean 23.7 years). T
wenty-four studies reported the
number of male and female participants. In total there were 552
(64%) men and 309 (36%) women. The athletes included in
this review played team and individual sports, ranging from
international levels of performance to regularly competing ama-
teurs. The national affiliation of the study’s lead author high-
lights the global interest in this topic (eg, Australia 44%, UK
24%, North America 20% and Scandinavia 12%).
Study characteristics
There were 14 qualitative, 9 quantitative and 2 mixed methods
studies included in our review (table 4). Sports injury rehabilita-
tion outcomes across the final studies focused on perceived and
actual markers of physical and psychological rehabilitation (see
online
supplementary
table
S1).
For
example,
return
to
sport,32 44 49 perceived success and effectiveness,31 36 46 and
time
loss
from
competition.35
Quantitative
studies
were
correlation-based and utilised a wide range (n=22) of previously
established inventories to measure psychosocial response, often
with multiple inventories used simultaneously.31 34 41 43 Seven
(32%) of the inventory measures used were specific to the
sports injury domain.
There was a broad range of operational definitions of sports
injury included across the included studies. Seventeen (68%)
studies used a time loss-based definition, ranging from one
day35 to two months.46 Where mean time loss was explicitly
stated, this ranged from 18.5 days to 9.4 months.23 Return to
competitive sport rates ranged from 51% to 78%.44 49 Injury
characteristics revealed a bias towards serious knee injuries with
eight studies of ACL injury (32%), and eight where serious knee
sprains dominated the range of pathologies. T
en studies (40%)
focused on injuries requiring surgical intervention; the remain-
ing 15 studies (60%) included a mixture of injuries or informa-
tion about whether surgical intervention was required or was
not stated.

There
were

 outcomes and (3) injury-related behaviours associated with
rehabilitation outcomes (table 5). The mean methodological
quality of the themes ranged from 56.3% to 58.8%.
Injury-related emotion associated with sport injury
rehabilitation outcomes
T
wenty studies had significant emotion-related (emotion, mood
and affect factors) content. Specifically, the role of mood,
anxiety and fear (re-injury and performance) and emotional
integrity emerged.
A number of studies found that as rehabilitation progressed
toward a return to sport, total mood disruption (TMD) and
total negative mood (TNM) decreased and more positive mood
states developed.30 34 36 McDonald and Hardy30 in a study of
five Division 1 athletes found a significant negative relationship
between TMD and the outcome of athlete perceived rehabilita-
tion (r=0.69, p≤0.0001).
Despite return to sport often being seen as a positive rehabili-
tation outcome, a number of studies reported heightened levels
of anxiety and/or fear during the transition.38 43 45 51 52 A fre-
quently
reported
cause
of
anxieties
and
fear
is
that
of
re-injury.37 45 49 Performance-related anxiety and fear was prom-
inent during the return to sport.36 38 52 50 Podlog and Eklund38
in a qualitative study of 12 athletes, all with severe injuries,
found that successful rehabilitation was associated with effect-
ively dealing with competition fears. Later work by the same
author, on 11 injured elite adolescent athletes,51 highlighted the
dual fears of pain and re-injury, together with the fear of falling
behind others, missing out and underperforming. This suggests
that fear is experienced by both adult and younger athletes.
Three studies highlighted findings related to poor emotional
integrity that is, finding athletes being reluctant to discuss their
emotions about being injured with their sporting peers and
coaches.36
39
45 Tracey36 found that when some athletes
returned to sport their feelings of isolation/alienation remained.
Mankad et al45 suggested that the inability to ‘emotionally dis-
close’ within the team environment was related to an impeded
long-term psychological rehabilitation from sports injury.
Injury-related cognitions associated with sport injury
rehabilitation outcomes
There were 18 studies that reached conclusions related to restor-
ation of the self (self-confidence, self-esteem, self-identity),
injury-related outlook, perceptions of basic psychological needs
fulfilment and perceptions of growth and development were
included. Injury-related cognitions appear to serve as ‘precur-
sors’ to the resulting emotional responses (ie, nervousness,
anxiety, excitement) and are associated with personal and situ-
ational factors.52 Personal factors such as gender, age, limited
injury experience, lowered confidence and perceptions of isola-
tion were all significantly related cognitions about not returning
to sport. 32 37 44 49 Delayed surgical intervention was a note-
worthy situational factor that was associated with negative risk
appraisal
and
non-return
to
sport
at
2–7 years
post-ACL
surgery.49
T
en studies identified restoring the self as being important in the
successful return to sport following injury.29 34 35 38 40 43–45 53
According to the reviewed studies restoring the self appears to
be: (1) an important motivating factor, (2) a common concern

time loss from sport due to injury.33 35 38 52
Six studies identified that a successful return to sport was asso-
ciated with feelings of sport-related self-confidence.29 34 44 43 50 53
Within this context sport-related confidence was relative to both
injury and performance. T
wo studies by Carson and Polman43 50
found confidence-building was important in the return to sport
with this developed from injury specific and performance spe-
cific inputs (eg, from fitness testing, performing well during
activity and the injury site feeling ‘strong’). Podlog et al53 found
confidence was a major attribute of psychological readiness to
return to sport. Overall confidence in returning to sport was
associated with the rehabilitation programme, the injured body
part, and performance capability beliefs. ‘Precursors’ to develop-
ing confidence in returning to sport were noted as having trust
in the rehabilitation provider, satisfaction of social support needs
and
achievement
of
physical
standards/clinical
outcomes.
Langford et al44 used the ACL return to sport after injury scale
(RSI) with injured athletes, and found a significant difference
between the group of returners to sport and those that had not
returned at 6 months (p=0.005) and 12 months (p=0.001).
Six studies (24%) inferred that fulfilling basic psychological
needs was an important predictor of successful return to sport.
Of these, three studies were grounded in basic psychological
needs theory55 and were published by the same author.38 46 51
The studies within this subset highlight the importance of
addressing
relatedness,
competence
and
autonomy
during
reintegration into sporting activities in order to reduce TNM
and to experience a successful rehabilitation.41 46 Notably, fulfil-
ment of competence, relatedness and autonomy seems import-
ant in elite adult and adolescent populations.38 46 51
Importantly, seven of the final studies (28%) suggested that
perceiving injury as an opportunity for growth, and as a positive
developmental
experience
was
related
to
a
successful
rehabilitation.35 36 38 48 52
Injury-related behaviour associated with sport injury
rehabilitation outcomes
T
welve studies (48%) contributed to this core theme relating to
the effect of coping strategies, and social interactions on the ath-
lete’s rehabilitation outcomes.
There was ambiguity in findings regarding which type of
coping mechanism was related to positive rehabilitation out-
comes. Avoidance focused coping strategies were suggested as

 being both facilitative47 and also debilitative.41
45 A mixed-
method study47 of elite professional rugby players found that
behavioural and cognitive avoidance coping strategies enhanced
perceptions of recovery. In contrast two studies credited using
avoidance coping with less successful rehabilitation outcomes
such as a delay in psychological rehabilitation,45 and associated
increase in TNM.41
There was stronger agreement within the final studies about
the positive association problem-focused coping strategies have
with rehabilitation outcomes, such as reintegration back into
training/competition.34 40 43 50 Gallagher and Gardner41 found
that in the return to sport phase of rehabilitation there was a
significant
negative
relationship
between
approach
focused
coping and TNM (r=−0.354, p≤0.05). T
wo studies by Carson
and Polman43 50 identified problem-focused coping strategies
enhanced the experience of returning to sport after an ACL
injury
Seven studies highlighted the importance of social interaction
to perceived and actual rehabilitation outcomes. Perceptions of
social support network provided by multiple agents (eg, team
mates, medical staff, coach, family, crowd) were particularly
salient on returning to sport.43 50 Trust in the rehabilitation pro-
vider, feeling wanted by others, and satisfaction of social
support needs were associated with psychological readiness to
return to sport.53 Insufficient social support appears to be asso-
ciated
with
unsuccessful
rehabilitation,32
and
remains
a
common concern on returning to sport.36 51
DISCUSSION
The aim of this review was to understand the association
between psychosocial factors and sports injury rehabilitation
outcomes. This aim was underpinned by the research question:
are psychosocial factors associated with sports injury rehabilita-
tion outcomes in competitive athletes? Of the 25 studies
included in our review, 20 had not been included in previous
reviews.
Our
findings
suggest
that
psychosocial
factors
(emotion-related, cognition-related and behavior-related) are
associated with a variety of perceived and actual rehabilitation
outcomes. It is thought that this process is cyclical in nature.52
For example, cognitions impact on injury-related emotions and
behaviours, and vice versa. Our findings are consistent with pre-
vious reviews and theoretical perspectives.2 13 16 56 However,
what is not known is to what extent these psychosocial factors
are related to rehabilitation outcomes; singularly or cumula-
tively, compared with biological factors.
Other domain-related systematic reviews14–16 highlight fear of
re-injury as one of the most common emotional factors asso-
ciated with rehabilitation outcomes after severe injury. Fear is
seen as a unitary construct within quantitative research designs
that dominate previous reviews. In contrast, the evidence from
this review highlights the fact that injured athletes experience
many anxieties and fears during rehabilitation. Our findings
suggest that the anxieties and fears athletes experience come in
two forms: (1) re-injury related37 45 49 and (2) performance
related.36
50 This knowledge may help inform psychological
intervention during the rehabilitation of injured athletes.
Evidence from our review and the broader literature suggests
an association between rehabilitation outcomes and anxiety/fear
of being re-injured.37
57
58 The athlete who can effectively
manage anxiety and fear will experience more positive out-
comes from rehabilitation.38 Ardern et al59 highlighted the
concept of ‘psychological readiness’ as important in determining
return to sport decisions following ACL injury. The construct of
‘psychological readiness’ in terms of sports injury can be
interpreted as being a combination of the athlete experiencing
low levels of fear regarding re-injury and underperforming.60
Restoring self-confidence was a key subset emerging from the
included studies.34 43 44 50 Self-confidence is derived from two
elements: (1) confidence in the injury site and (2) confidence in
performance. Confidence may have a moderating effect on the
emotion of fear as both seem determined by injury and
performance-related inputs. This review indicates that successful
return to sport is underpinned by developing self-confidence
cognitions, even though the mechanism of effect is not yet fully
established.29 50 Confidence in returning to sport after injury
appears to be a multidimensional factor.53 Developing confi-
dence in the injured body part and in the ability to perform to a
satisfactory standard may act as a ‘buffer’ from injury-related
anxiety and fear. The implication of this is athletes would
acquire the suitable ‘psychological readiness’ to return.
Experiencing adversity has the potential to yield positive out-
comes. Nonetheless, it is important to note that stress-related
growth is not inevitable.61 An ability to perceive sport injury
rehabilitation as an opportunity for development and growth
was associated with more positive rehabilitation outcomes.35 48
A perspective from W
adey et al62 is that growth through adver-
sity may even lead to ‘positive changes that propel them to a
real or perceived higher level of functioning than that which
existed prior to the negative circumstance’. It seems that per-
ceiving the experience related to injury as positive may facilitate
returning to sport,38 enable a more holistic recovery.48 Different
forms of growth that can occur through injury include: per-
sonal, psychological, social and physical.62 Practitioners may
consider encouraging athletes to reflect on the injury experience
as an opportunity for growth to facilitate positive rehabilitation
outcomes.
Emotional integrity relates to the athletes conscious decision
to either withhold or disclose false injury-related emotions, and
emerged as an important subset. This may compound percep-
tions of isolation and impede psychological rehabilitation out-
comes.36 39 45 Our findings support the theoretical propositions
of Wiese-Bjornstal,13 whereby emotional integrity (or emotional
inhibition as phrased in the model) is identified as an emotion-
related factor associated with rehabilitation outcomes. The emo-
tional integrity (or lack of) could have a profound effect on the
ability to collect accurate data. A lack of emotional integrity
may challenge the validity of some studies already published
and challenges researchers to develop methodologies to over-
come this problem. Both researchers and practitioners should
give injured athletes the opportunity to use non-traditional
forms of communication (eg, blogs and diaries).
Current empirical limitations and future directions
The empirical literature relating to adult male athletes with
severe knee injury (eg, ACL) is well established. W
e conclude
that
this
has
created
gender-related,
age-related
and
injury-related biases in the literature, limiting generalisability of
findings. Male and females have different physical and psycho-
logical responses to injury. This can lead to very different injury
experiences and outcomes.63
64 Age-related differences is a
neglected area in sport injury psychology.65 The fact that only
one
study
included
adolescent
participants
highlights
this
problem. Researchers and practitioners should be aware of the
gender, age and injury differences across athletic populations to
better facilitate positive rehabilitation outcomes.
Most studies reviewed adopted the perspective that return to
sport is the major rehabilitation outcome, and cease their data
collection at this point.40 41 Return to play is often seen as the

 defining feature of recovery and has been criticised for skewing
the evidence base.66 It is naïve to assume that just because an
athlete returns to sport postinjury that they are fully recovered
both physically and psychologically. It is plausible that the inter-
pretation of a successful rehabilitation is associated with many
complex
biopsychosocial,
technical
and
tactical
factors.
Therefore, using return to preinjury activity levels as the sole
indicator may be too simplistic.
Included studies lacked detail regarding comorbidity, multiple
pathologies, iatrogenic issues or mis-diagnosis issues, despite these
being potentially striking features of the injured athlete’s experi-
ence.2 13 There appears to be little empirical literature on compli-
cated, multipathological or unsuccessful rehabilitation. Studies
using negative case analytical approaches could profoundly
change our understanding of the area. For example, studying ath-
letes that have had a complicated or unsuccessful rehabilitation.
The bias towards non-experimental, correlational designs
within the literature restricts the ability to establish causal relation-
ships between psychosocial factors and injury rehabilitation out-
comes. Owing to the nature of evidence reviewed a causal link
between psychosocial factors and rehabilitation outcomes cannot
be reliably inferred. In addition to exploring experiences of
injured athletes, future research could also explore causal patterns.
Strengths and limitations of this review
There are methodological challenges in conducting a mixed
studies systematic review.19 The tendency for systematic reviews
to exclude non-experimental research has received criticism,
particularly because it does not account very well for the local
and experiential nature of a clinicians work.19 67 68
There is a growing call for mixed study reviews within the
healthcare sector to address the perceived divergence between
research and practice.19 68 This review is a positive response to
this call and therefore offers an important contribution to the
literature. The reviewed quantitative evidence provides associa-
tions between psychosocial factors and rehabilitation outcomes.
Additionally, the qualitative and mixed methods evidence eluci-
dates mechanisms behind these associations, and how psycho-
social
factors
are
modified
throughout
the
rehabilitation
process. This review was focused on competitive athletes.
Therefore, this precludes any robust generalisability to other
populations such as recreational and intramural athletes or non-
athletic patient groups. All levels of competitive athlete were
included. It is plausible that athletes with more time investment
in sport or those who gain financial benefit for participation
may exhibit different types and/or intensity of psychosocial
factors.14 Since we considered all published literature, there is a
chance the results of older studies may not be generalisable to
modern sports medicine practice. This review included all
sports injury types to develop an understanding beyond simply
ACL injury. It must be noted however, that the findings of this
review are based on a sizeable percentage of postoperative ACL
participants. Injury severity and type may be a confounding
factor when examining sports injury rehabilitation outcomes.14
An athlete with more severe injuries may exhibit more pro-
longed and severe negative psychosocial responses proliferating
into the return to sport phase. Including studies with mixed
time loss is ecologically valid, however, by aggregating studies
the ability to differentiate injury experiences across specific
populations is diminished. For example, whether analogous psy-
chosocial factors are associated with injuries requiring surgical
versus non-surgical intervention could be debated.
If injury outcomes are associated with psychosocial factors as
this
and
other
reviews
suggest,
practitioners
need
to
be
empowered to recognise and address these factors or appropri-
ately refer on.69 70
CONCLUSION
W
e found that the athlete’s injury-related cognitions, emotions
and behaviours were associated with sports injury rehabilitation
outcomes. Restoring self-confidence, while at the same time
inoculating against emotions of anxiety/fear appears to increase
the likelihood of a successful rehabilitation. Meeting social
support needs and employing appropriate coping strategies
appears important in facilitating this. It seems common for ath-
letes
not
to
fully
disclose
their
injury-related
emotions.
Practitioners should consider approaches to improve an athlete’s
emotional integrity and regularly monitor psychosocial factors
throughout rehabilitation. The injury experience can be an
opportunity for growth and development. Practitioners should
enable their athletes to perceive the injury experience as posi-
tive, as this is related to positive outcomes.
What are the findings?
▸ Psychosocial factors including how an athlete thinks, feels
and acts are associated with the outcomes of rehabilitation.
▸ An athlete’s psychological readiness to return to play
appears to be a product of fear, anxiety, confidence in
performing well and remaining uninjured.
▸ Being female, young, having a limited experience of injury,
negative emotion and perceptions of isolation are factors
related to less successful outcomes of rehabilitation.
▸ Our current interpretation of a successful rehabilitation is
overly simplistic and associated with many biopsychosocial,
technical and tactical factors.
▸ This research topic has gender, age and injury-related bias
that future research should address.
How might it impact on clinical practice in the future?
▸ Practitioners need to be aware that injured athletes are
emotionally vulnerable, and that their emotional integrity
may be questionable during rehabilitation.
▸ Practitioners should encourage athletes to perceive the injury
experience as an opportunity for growth and development.
▸ Practitioners need to ensure injured athletes are physically,
psychologically, socially, tactically and technically ready to
return to sport.
▸ Practitioners should not assume that physical and
psychosocial recovery from injury occurs within the same
timeframe.
