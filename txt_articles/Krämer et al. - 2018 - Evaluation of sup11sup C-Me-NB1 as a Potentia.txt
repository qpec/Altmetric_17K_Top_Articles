Clinical and preclinical research with modulators at the N-methyl-D-
aspartate (NMDA) receptor GluN2B N-terminal domain (NTD) aims
for the treatment of various neurologic diseases. The interpreta-
tion of the results is hampered by the lack of a suitable NMDA
PET tracer for assessing the receptor occupancy of potential
drugs. We have developed 11C-Me-NB1 as a PET tracer for imaging
GluN1/GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors and used it to in-
vestigate in rats the dose-dependent receptor occupancy of eli-
prodil, a GluN2B NTD modulator. Methods: 11C-Me-NB1 was
synthesized and characterized by in vitro displacement binding ex-
periments with rat brain membranes, in vitro autoradiography, and
blocking and displacement experiments by PET and PET kinetic
modeling. Receptor occupancy by eliprodil was studied by PET with
11C-Me-NB1. Results: 11C-Me-NB1 was synthesized at 290 6 90
GBq/mmol molar activity, 7.4 6 1.9 GBq total activity at the end of
synthesis (n 5 17), and more than 99% radiochemical purity. 11C-
Me-NB1 binding in rat brain was blocked in vitro and in vivo by the
NTD modulators Ro-25-6981 and eliprodil. Half-maximal receptor
occupancy by eliprodil occurred at 1.5 mg/kg. At 1 mg/kg of elipro-
dil, a dose with reported neuroprotective effects, more than 99.5%
of binding sites were occupied. In vitro, 11C-Me-NB1 binding was
independent of the s-1 receptor (Sigma1R), and the Sigma1R ago-
nist (1)-pentazocine did not compete for high-affinity binding. In
vivo, a 2.5 mg/kg dose of (1)-pentazocine abolished
11C-Me-
NB1–specific binding, indicating an indirect effect of Sigma1R on
11C-Me-NB1 binding. Conclusion: 11C-Me-NB1 is suitable for the in
vivo imaging of NMDA GluN1/GluN2B receptors and the assess-
ment of receptor occupancy by NTD modulators. GluN1/GluN2B
NMDA receptors are fully occupied at neuroprotective doses of
eliprodil. Furthermore, 11C-Me-NB1 enables imaging of GluN1/GluN2B
NMDA receptor cross talk.

Pharmacologic modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptors may become an efficient therapeutic strategy for the treat-
ment of cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer disease, Huntington disease,
Parkinson disease, depression, neuropathic pain, and schizophrenia
(1). A functional NMDA receptor consists of 4 subunits of the 3
subfamilies GluN1, GluN2A–D, and GluN3A,B. Typically, 2 subunits
are GluN1 and the other 2 are mainly from the GluN2 subfamily (1,2).
The receptor is coactivated by glutamate and glycine or D-serine.
Besides the agonist binding domains, the receptor offers additional
sites for pharmacologic modulation (1,2). Ifenprodil, eliprodil, and
Ro-25-6981 bind to the N-terminal domain (NTD) interface of 2
subunits with high selectivity for GluN1/GluN2B (NTD binding site)
over GluN1/GluN2A (1,2). Despite promising in vitro results with
NTD modulators, effective doses in preclinical studies were often
higher than expected, and results from clinical trials did not meet
the expectations (3,4). Ligand sharing between the NTD binding site
and s-receptors, and the direct or indirect control of NMDA receptor
activity and localization by the s-1 receptor (Sigma1R) and dopamine
receptors, are among the discussed confounding factors (5,6).
In our efforts to develop a PET radioligand for imaging GluN1/
GluN2B receptors, we developed 11C-Me-NB1 (Fig. 1). 11C-Me-
NB1 is based on WMS-1405 (herein designated Me-NB1), an
NTD binding site ligand derived from ifenprodil with improved
metabolic stability, 5.4 nM affinity (Ki) to hGluN1/hGluN2B,
and no modulatory effect at hGluN1/hGluN2A receptors. It has
33- and 100-fold selectivity for hGluN1/hGluN2B over human
Sigma1R and s-2 receptors (Sigma2R), respectively (7). Apply-
ing 11C-Me-NB1, we characterized the distribution pattern of
NTD modulator binding sites in the rat brain and investigated
their dose-dependent occupancy by eliprodil (Ki 5 13 nM for
hGluN1/hGluN2B; Ki 5 132 and 634 nM for rat Sigma1R and
Sigma2R, respectively) (8). Furthermore, we examined whether 11C-
Me-NB1 PET can be used to investigate receptor cross talk involving
GluN1/GluN2B receptors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Radiolabeling and In Vitro Characterization
11C-Me-NB1 was produced by reacting 11C-CH3I with 3-(4-phenylbutyl)-
2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine-1,7-diol (9) (Fig. 1). The log D
was determined by the shake-flask method with 11C-Me-NB1 in
n-octanol/phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4. Binding affinities were
determined in competition binding assays with rat brain membranes

 (10–12). For autoradiography, horizontal brain slices of adult male
wild-type mice and Wistar rats or Sigma1R knockout mice lacking
the Sigma1R encoding genomic sequence except for the first 4 codons
(13) were incubated with 11C-Me-NB1 alone or in combination.
Ex Vivo Biodistribution
Animal experiments were in accordance with the Swiss legislation
on animal welfare and approved by the Veterinary Office of the
Canton Zurich, Switzerland. Twelve conscious male Wistar rats (296–
373 g) received, via the tail vein, a 2 mL/kg injection of eliprodil
vehicle (5% glucose, 0.45% NaCl, 1 mM citric acid, pH 7) or a 2
mg/kg injection of eliprodil (1 mg/mL) and, 1 min later, 3.1–36.3
MBq (0.5–1.6 nmol/kg) of 11C-Me-NB1 in 250 mL of saline contain-
ing no more than 8% ethanol. The rats were sacrificed by decapitation
under isoflurane anesthesia 15 min after tracer injection. Tissues were
dissected and weighed, radioactivity was quantified, and SUVs were
calculated (Supplemental Fig. 1; supplemental materials are available
at http://jnm.snmjournals.org).
PET Experiments with an Input Function
Seven male Wistar rats (331–353 g) were scanned with simulta-
neous recording of the blood coincidences (14). In brief, anesthesia
was initiated with 5% isoflurane 40–60 min before the start of the scan
and maintained at 2.5%–5% isoflurane. An arteriovenous shunt was
applied by cannulation of the tail artery and a lateral tail vein. The rat
was transferred to the scanner bed (SuperArgus PET/CT scanner
[Sedecal]; axial field of view, 4.8 cm; spatial resolution, 1.6–
1.7 mm in full width at half maximum (15)), and the shunt was guided
through a Twilite coincidence counter (Swisstrace) and a peristaltic
pump (200–300 mL/min). The blood counter and PET scanner were
started, and at time zero, 32–52 MBq (0.44–0.78 nmol/kg, 250–300
mL) of 11C-Me-NB1 were injected via a separate, cannulated tail vein.
Data were acquired for 60 min, followed by a CT scan. The rats were
euthanized under anesthesia immediately after the scan. Between
28 and 31 min before the start of the scan, the rats received either a
25 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of ketamine in water (25 mg/mL;
3 rats) or water alone (1 mL/kg; 4 rats). Only 2 (with ketamine) and
3 (baseline) blood curves were available for analysis, because the ar-
teriovenous shunt became clogged in 2 rats. The ratios of parent tracer
to total radioactivity in plasma and homogenized brain were deter-
mined from additional rats. The plasma–to–whole-blood radioactivity
ratio was 1.11.
PET Experiments Without an Input Function
Twenty-three Wistar rats (327–409 g) were scanned as described
above but without an arteriovenous shunt. Anesthesia was induced 15–
35 min before tracer injection. Test compounds in less than 1 mL of
vehicle (Me-NB1, the same as eliprodil; (1)-pentazocine, 2:8 0.1 M
HCl:lactated Ringer solution; Ro-25-6981, 1:1 polyethylene glycol
300:saline) were injected intravenously on the scanner bed under
anesthesia at 1 min (Me-NB1, eliprodil, and (1)-pentazocine), 5 min
(Ro-25-6981), or 20 min (haloperidol (16)) before 11C-Me-NB1. The
injected doses of 11C-Me-NB1 were 20–89 MBq. The total doses were
0.4–3,000 nmol/kg (0.00013–1 mg/kg) for 11C-Me-NB1 and Me-NB1,
0.7–5,700 nmol/kg (0.00025–2 mg/kg) for eliprodil, 16.4 mmol/kg
(7.5 mg/kg, free base) for Ro-25-6981, 346
nmol/kg (0.13 mg/kg) for haloperidol (Haldol;
Janssen-Cilag), and 8.8 mmol/kg (2.5 mg/kg)
for (1)-pentazocine. For baseline scans, the
respective vehicle was injected. In a displace-
ment experiment, eliprodil, 1 mg/kg, in 450
mL of vehicle was injected into the tail vein
20 min after the start of the scan.
PET Data Reconstruction and Analysis
PET data were reconstructed as described in Supplemental Figure
1. Images and time–activity curves were generated with PMOD, ver-
sion 3.7 (PMOD Technologies), with predefined regions of interest,
modified from the PMOD template (Supplemental Fig. 1). Scans with
an input function were analyzed with Matlab (MathWorks) by com-
partmental modeling (14,17). In brief, the clearance parameter of
tracer transfer from plasma to brain (K1), the rate constants of transfer
out of the brain (k2), receptor binding (k3), and dissociation from the
receptor (k4), as well as the K1 and k2 of the radiometabolite (K1M,
k2M), were fitted for whole brain for the full scan duration, and the
respective volume of distribution (V) of total tracer (VT,fit 5 K1/k2 · (1 1
k3/k4)), the V of specifically bound tracer (VS 5 K1/k2 · k3/k4), the V
of nondisplaceable tracer (VND 5 K1/k2), the V ratio VT/VND (DVR), and
the nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND 5 k3/k4 5 DVR-1) were
calculated (17,18). VT was also determined from the Logan plot
(VT,Logan) (17,19). Blood coincidence start time and background, and a
biexponential function describing the ratio of parent to total radioactivity
in plasma, were fitted together with the rate constants. The results were
confirmed with the PKIN module of PMOD, version 3.9. For the fits of
the individual brain regions and truncated scan durations, only K1 to k4
were fitted; all other parameters were used as fitted for whole brain.
For quantification without an input function, SUV was averaged
from 0 to 60 min (SUV0–60min). For the receptor occupancy study,
SUV0–60min was fitted with the function in Equation 1.

SUV0–60min,min and SUV0–60min,max are the plateaus, and d is the sum

latter multiplied by a weighting factor f. The fitted parameters were

SUV0–60min,max. Receptor occupancy (d/(D50 1 d)) was calculated by
rearranging Equation 1. Percentage specific binding was calculated as

 binding site; similar affinity to guinea pig Sigma1R and Sigma2R
(21,22)) competed with the binding of both 3H-ifenprodil and the
SigmaR1 agonist (1)-3H-pentazocine with 2-digit nanomolar Ki
(Supplemental Table 1). Haloperidol, an antagonist for D2, D3,
and D4 receptors and an inverse agonist of Sigma1R (7,23), com-
peted in the micromolar range with 3H-ifenprodil (20�C and 37�C)
and (1)-3H-pentazocine (20�C) but with 2-digit nanomolar Ki
with (1)-3H-pentazocine at 37�C. The Ki for the competition of
eliprodil with 3H-ifenprodil was 48.5 6 32.0 nM (20�C), in agree-
ment with previous findings (4). Its competition with (1)-3H-
pentazocine was weak (Ki $ 229 nM, 37�C). Me-NB1 bound with
a Ki of 40.2 6 2.8 nM in competition with 3H-ifenprodil but
competed only weakly with (1)-3H-pentazocine (half-maximal
inhibitory concentration . 4 mM, 37�C), confirming a high selec-
tivity of Me-NB1 for the rat NTD binding site over rat Sigma1R.
11C-Me-NB1 Autoradiography and Biodistribution
In vitro autoradiography revealed binding of
11C-Me-NB1
throughout the brain. Binding was reduced by eliprodil (54 nM,
10 mM), Ro-25-6981 (100 mM), haloperidol (10 mM), or an excess
of Me-NB1 (100 mM) but not by 1 mM glutamate (Supplemental
Fig. 2). Specific binding was confirmed in ex vivo biodistribution
experiments (Supplemental Fig. 3). Brain SUVs were 3.8 6 1.2
for midbrain, 3.7 6 1.0 for cortex, 2.8 6 0.8 for cerebellum, and
2.7 6 0.7 for olfactory bulb (n 5 8). Eliprodil (2 mg/kg intrave-
nously) reduced 11C-Me-NB1 accumulation in all brain regions.
The relative reduction was highest for
midbrain, brain stem, cortex, and striatum
(all . 40% and significant) and lowest and
not significant for hippocampus (31.9%)
and cerebellum (34.5%). In peripheral tis-
sues, accumulation was highest in adrenal
glands (SUV, 10.3 6 2.9; 52.9% specific).
The SUV in blood was significantly (P 5
0.002) higher under blocking conditions
(0.300 6 0.035) than under baseline condi-
tions (0.194 6 0.045).
11C-Me-NB1 PET and PET Kinetic
Modeling
Figure 2 shows PET images under base-
line and blocking conditions. Time–activity
curves of 11C-Me-NB1 in various brain re-
gions and after blocking and displacement
with eliprodil are shown in Figure 2 and
Supplemental Figure 4. Both blocking and
displacement reduced the SUV, further con-
firming the specific and reversible binding
of 11C-Me-NB1.
Data of 5 scans with an arterial blood
time–activity curve were available, and
brain time–activity curves were fitted to a
1- and 2-tissue-compartment model. The
presence of a polar radiometabolite in
plasma and up to 7% in brain (determined
from brain homogenates) was considered
for the analysis (Fig. 3). Fits with a 2-tissue-
compartment model and the respective
Logan plots are shown in Figure 3 (whole
brain) and Supplemental Figures 5 and 6
(regions). Parametric maps for VT for the
scan in Figure 2A are shown in Supplemental Figure 7. VT,fit and
VT,Logan of 12 brain regions each for the 5 scans are depicted in
Supplemental Figure 8. Supplemental Figure 9 shows the fit of the
data in Figure 3 with a 1-tissue-compartment model and the resid-
uals for both models. The Akaike information criterion favored the
2-tissue-compartment model. For all scans, VT,fit of whole brain
remained within 65% when the scan end time for data analysis
was reduced to any time between 13 and 60 min (Fig. 3D). Ignoring
radiometabolite distribution to the brain resulted in similar fit pa-
rameters. Supplemental Tables 2–4 show the fit parameters for
whole brain on the individual scans. Averaged for the 5 scans and
for whole brain, VT,fit was 11.8 6 0.7; BPND, 3.77 6 0.97; and VND,
2.57 6 0.56. Average K1 was 2.9 6 0.9 mL/cm3/min; k2, 1.2 6
0.6 min21; k3, 0.73 6 0.09 min21, and k4, 0.20 6 0.04 min21.
PET Quantification Without an Arterial Input Function and
Effect of Ketamine
Because a reference region without specific binding of 11C-Me-
NB1 was not available for input-function independent analysis
(17), SUV0–60min was evaluated as a surrogate for VT. The Pearson
r2 for the linear correlation between SUV0–60min and VT,fit of 5 rats
(12 brain regions) was 0.913 (Supplemental Fig. 8B). The trans-
formed (according to the correlation) SUV0–60min of all 4 baseline
scans and 3 scans after ketamine challenge agreed with VT,fit val-
ues (Supplemental Fig. 10). The subtherapeutic dose of ketamine
was administered to investigate whether changes in glutamate

 levels affect 11C-Me-NB1 accumulation (24). Our results (VT and
SUV0–60min) excluded a major influence of ketamine on 11C-Me-
NB1 accumulation under isoflurane anesthesia (Supplemental Fig.
10; Supplemental Tables 3 and 4).
Receptor Occupancy by Eliprodil
Using 11C-Me-NB1, we determined the dose-dependent occu-
pancy of the NTD binding sites by eliprodil. D50 was 4.2 nmol/kg
(1.5 mg/kg) for whole brain (Fig. 4). The fit dose to reach 99%
occupancy was 150 mg/kg. Specific bind-
ing was 46.9%. Fits for individual brain
regions revealed D50 values of between
3.2 and 7.3 nmol/kg (Supplemental Fig.
11). Nondisplaceable tracer uptake had
no effect on D50 (Supplemental Fig. 12).
A Lassen plot analysis (25) revealed a D50
of 8.5 nmol/kg (Supplemental Fig. 13).
Imaging Receptor Cross Talk with
11C-Me-NB1
NMDA receptor activity is modulated by
Sigma1R and dopamine receptors (6,26,27).
We used (1)-pentazocine and haloperidol to
modulate Sigma1R and dopamine receptors,
respectively. Both (1)-pentazocine and halo-
peridol showed only weak competition with
3H-ifenprodil in the competition binding as-
says. (1)-pentazocine brain concentrations
were aimed at 350–2,000 nM (28), and the
dose of haloperidol corresponded to 10-fold
the D50 in a D2 and D3 receptor occupancy
study with 11C-raclopride in rats (16). At these
concentrations, Sigma1Rs and D2 and D3
receptors, respectively, should be occupied,
whereas no direct binding to GluN1/GluN2B
receptors should occur. Both haloperidol
and (1)-pentazocine abolished 11C-Me-
NB1–specific binding under these condi-
tions (Fig. 5A).
To exclude both a direct competition
between 11C-Me-NB1 and (1)-pentazocine
binding, and high-affinity binding of 11C-
Me-NB1 to Sigma1R, we performed in vitro
autoradiography with brain slices from
Sigma1R knockout mice (Figs. 5E and 5F
and Supplemental Fig. 14). 11C-Me-NB1
binding did not differ between slices from
wild-type and Sigma1R knockout mice, ex-
cluding significant binding of 11C-Me-NB1
to Sigma1R. (1)-pentazocine (1 mM) re-
duced the binding for both genotypes by
less than 10% (P , 0.05), whereas the same
concentration of eliprodil reduced the bind-
ing for both genotypes by 40% (P , 0.01),
similar to the ex vivo biodistribution ex-
periment and receptor occupancy study.
Autoradiography at 3 different 11C-Me-NB1
concentrations revealed high-affinity binding
in all brain regions of rat, mouse, and Sigma1R
knockout mouse, including the GluN2B-free
cerebellum, in agreement with the PET results.
DISCUSSION
To date, no clinically validated PET radioligand exists for the
imaging of NMDA receptors. Reasons for failure include lack of
in vivo specificity and selectivity, low affinity, poor metabolic
stability, and poor distribution to the brain (29–34). Aiming to
overcome the shortcomings of previously reported radioligands,
and given the excellent in vitro properties of Me-NB1, we

 developed 11C-Me-NB1 for imaging GluN2B receptors. 11C-Me-
NB1 was obtained in high radiochemical yields and molar activ-
ities. In vivo, it followed a 2-tissue-compartment model, with
SUV0–60min as a useful surrogate for VT, but with the caveat of
its inherent high variability (17).
11C-Me-NB1 binding faced competition from low doses of eli-
prodil in all brain regions, including midbrain, pons, and cere-
bellum with low GluN2B levels (35–38). Off-target binding to
Sigma1R was excluded in vitro. The GluN2B-poor regions contain
significant levels of GluN2D or GluN2C (36). 11C-Me-NB1 and
eliprodil may bind to these or alternative GluN receptor subtypes
in addition to GluN1/GluN2B receptors. The high specific binding
of 11C-Me-NB1 in adrenal gland tissue, which contains GluN1,
GluN2C, and GluN2D but not GluN2A or GluN2B (39), supports
this hypothesis.
In preclinical studies, eliprodil had neuroprotective effects at
1 mg/kg (4,40,41). This corresponds to full ($99.5%) receptor
occupancy in our study. As discussed by Carter et al. (4), anti-
depressant and anticonvulsive effects observed at even higher
doses may have resulted from lower-affinity binding to alternative
targets.
The Sigma1R agonist (1)-pentazocine abolished 11C-Me-NB1–
specific binding in the rat brain despite the lack of direct compe-
tition in vitro. (1)-pentazocine stabilizes the Sigma1R in its
dimeric and monomeric forms, which interact with other proteins
(23). Besides indirect effects on NMDA receptors, such as phos-
phorylation, a direct interaction between Sigma1R and the NTD of
GluN1 that is involved in the interface with the GluN2B NTD was
recently demonstrated (42). This interaction may directly hamper
11C-Me-NB1 binding. Alternatively, direct or indirect NMDA
receptor modulation could bring the receptor
to a conformation with reduced binding
affinity for NTD ligands. Finally, altered
receptor trafficking and cell-surface density
could affect 11C-Me-NB1 accumulation.
Several mechanisms could result in the
elimination of 11C-Me-NB1–specific bind-
ing observed with haloperidol. Activation
of dopamine receptors modulates NMDA
receptor–mediated Ca21 currents, and treat-
ment of rats with a 1 mg/kg dose of halo-
peridol altered the phosphorylation pattern
of GluN1 and GluN2B (6,26,43,44). Halo-
peridol also modulates s-receptors (7,45).
We did not further investigate the molecular
mechanisms. However, our data suggest that
11C-Me-NB1 PET could become a useful
tool to visualize the consequences of recep-
tor cross talk involving GluN2B-containing
NMDA receptors.
CONCLUSION
We have successfully developed a PET
tracer, 11C-Me-NB1, that allows noninva-
sive imaging of the density of NTD bind-
ing sites containing NMDA receptors. In
the future, this development may allow
the density of GluN2B/GluN1A receptors
in neuronal diseases to be followed non-
invasively and receptor occupancy under
therapeutic intervention to be studied. Our receptor-occupancy
study suggests that the published neuroprotective effects of elipro-
dil in rats required complete occupancy of the NTD binding sites.
11C-Me-NB1 PET is sensitive to drug-induced receptor cross talk.

Influence of (1)-pentazocine and haloperidol on 11C-Me-NB1 PET in rat brain (A),
and in vitro autoradiography with brain slices of S1R knockout (ko) mice (B and C). (A) Time–
activity curves after drug administration and after blocking with Me-NB1, eliprodil, and Ro-25-
6981 are shown. SUV within first few minutes may be affected by drug-induced changes in
cerebral blood flow (46,47) and increased plasma levels under blocking conditions (Fig. 3). (B)
11C-Me-NB1 autoradiograms of brain slices from Sigma1R knockout and wild-type mice. Incu-
bation was with 4.0 nM 11C-Me-NB1 alone (baseline) or together with (1)-pentazocine or eliprodil.
(C) Quantitative analysis of autoradiograms in B. No significant difference was found between
wild-type and Sigma1R knockout mice for any of the 3 conditions (P . 0.05). (1)-pentazocine
(1 μM) reduced 11C-Me-NB1 binding in wild-type and Sigma1R knockout mice by ,10%. Re-
duction by equal concentration of eliprodil was 40% and 42%, respectively (horizontal dashed
line, P , 0.05; solid lines, P , 0.01). a.u. 5 arbitrary units.
