The Affordability of MyPlate: An Analysis of SNAP
Benefits and the Actual Cost of Eating According
to the Dietary Guidelines
Kranti Mulik, PhD1; Lindsey Haynes-Maslow, PhD, MHA2
ABSTRACT
Objective: To estimate the funds required to support a MyPlate diet and to estimate the additional costs
needed for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients to adhere to the MyPlate diet.
Design: Using the US Department of Agriculture’s (USDA’s) MyPlate dietary guidelines that specify
recommendations for individuals based on age and gender and retail price data from the USDA, the
cost of following USDA’s MyPlate guidelines for consuming 3 meals daily was estimated for the following
individuals: children, adolescents, female adults, male adults, female seniors, male seniors, and a 4-person
family.
Main Outcome Measures: Cost of consuming a MyPlate diet, including canned, frozen, and fresh
produce as part of the diet.
Analysis: Descriptive analysis of the cost of consuming a MyPlate diet.
Results: Consuming a MyPlate diet consisting of only fresh fruits and vegetables is the most expensive
diet. The monthly additional costs on an individual basis is the largest for boys aged 12–17 years
($75/mo) because they have the largest quantity of food consumed compared with all other gender and
age groups. The monthly cost for a family of 4 ranged from $1,109 to $1,249/mo.
Conclusions and Implications: The monetary amount of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program
benefits may be insufficient to support a healthy diet recommended by federal nutrition guidelines.

INTRODUCTION
Over the past 30 years, obesity rates
among adults in the US have more
than
doubled
and
approximately
two-thirds
of
adults
are
currently
overweight or
obese.1,2
Consuming
healthy foods, including fruits and
vegetables, whole grains, and lean
proteins, can prevent weight gain
and reduce the risk of diet-related
chronic diseases, including heart dis-
ease, diabetes, and some cancers.3
Low-income
individuals
are
more
vulnerable to diet-related chronic dis-
ease.4 Having limited resources is 1
reason why low-income individuals
are less likely than higher-income in-
dividuals to adhere to the federal Die-
tary Guidelines for Americans.5 This
includes not being able to afford pur-
chasing
healthier
foods,
lack
of
geographic access to healthy foods,
and not having time to prepare and
cook healthy foods.5,6
The
US
Federal
Government
created
the
Supplemental
Nutrition
Assistance Program (SNAP) in 1939 to
alleviate food insecurity.7 Since its cre-
ation, SNAP has shifted its focus to
include improving dietary intake.7 It
is the largest federal food assistance
program that offers benefits usable as
cash for the purchase of food by
lower-income individuals in the US,
serving 27% of all children and approx-
imately 21 million households.8 Gener-
ally, households whose incomes are
<130% of the poverty level and pass
an asset test are eligible for SNAP. Fam-
ilies can spend their benefits on foods
to be eaten at home. The average
monthly benefit per person is $125
and $254 per household, and nearly
all benefits are spent by the end of the
month.8 In 2015, SNAP provided more
than $75 billion in benefits to approxi-
mately 47 million people.9 Most of
these people lived in households with
children.
Overall, research showed that SNAP
is effective at reducing food insecu-
rity.10-12 One study indicated that
SNAP
reduced
food
insecurity
by
approximately 30%.10 In addition to

 reducing food insecurity, there was
also research to support that SNAP im-
proves child and adult health out-
comes, including physical and mental
health.13 Despite these positive find-
ings, many families receiving SNAP
report significant financial barriers to
purchasing healthy food with their
benefits.14,15 This may partially explain
why studies on SNAP recipients' diets
showed
that
compared
with
non-
recipients, SNAP recipients have lower
diet quality.16,17 Although SNAP is
meant to be a supplementary aid
program
and
is
not
intended
to
finance the entire cost of eating a
healthy diet, recent federal budget
proposals suggested decreasing the
amount of SNAP benefits available
for food.18 Reducing the amount of
SNAP benefits available for eligible in-
dividuals may decrease the program's
ability to support healthier diets among
food-insecure individuals and families.
In 2011, the USDA calculated the
cost of various food plans (low-cost,
moderate cost, and liberal) based on
federal dietary guidelines.19 The orga-
nization determined that adhering to
a nutritious low-cost diet would cost
$147/wk for a family of 4 (4 adults
aged 20–50 years and 2 children aged
6–8
and
9–11
years).
The
report
concluded that it would be possible
for people to eat healthier, including
more vegetables and fruits, and spend
less on food. However, the USDA's
analysis was not based on the current
federal dietary guidelines, and calcula-
tions were based on the 2005 Food
Pyramid dietary guidelines instead of
the more recent MyPlate, which re-
placed the Food Pyramid in 2010.20
Several notable changes included re-
naming the meat and beans and
milk groups to the protein and dairy
groups to allow for lacto-ovo vege-
tarian
and
vegan
eating
patterns,
respectively.21 In addition, MyPlate
modified the structure and composi-
tion of vegetable subgroups to pro-
mote diversity of vegetables.21 Because
of the changes in food groups and sub-
groups from the Food Pyramid to My-
Plate, the USDA's 2011 analysis using
the Food Pyramid to calculate the
low-cost diet may not be as accurate.

 Because
research
is
often
used
to
inform policy, an analysis using the
most current data is needed to inform
policy makers regarding the true costs
of healthy eating, so that they have
up-to-date research when making pol-
icy decisions.
More recently, the USDA estimated
the cost of satisfying fruit and vege-
table
requirements
under
MyPlate
guidelines based on 2013 retail scan-
ner data.22 Researchers found that
consuming MyPlate levels of fruits
and vegetables (fresh, canned, frozen,
dried, and 100% juice) would cost
between $2.10 and $2.60 per day, or
47–57 cents/cup-equivalent. For those
following a low-cost diet, the USDA
found that a family of 4 would need
to spend, on average, #50 cents/cup-
equivalent.
To date, no studies have calculated
the cost of following MyPlate's dietary
recommendations for all food groups
(fruits, vegetables, grains, dairy, and
protein). To address this knowledge
gap, the purposes of this article were
to (1) estimate the total costs required
to support a MyPlate diet, and (2) esti-
mate the additional costs needed for
SNAP recipients to adhere to a nutri-
tionally sound diet.
METHODS
Data Sources
This study used the most current pub-
licly available data from the USDA's
retail
prices
and
SNAP
eligibility
data, which were necessary to conduct
a thorough analysis. Monthly retail
price data for beef, poultry cuts, and
eggs from the USDA's Economic Re-
search Service were averaged over the
12 months in 2015 (Table 1).23 The
average meat price was calculated us-
ing the average price of lean beef,
poultry, turkey, and eggs to date.23
All prices were in dollars per pound
and converted to dollars per ounce.
The prices for whole grains, other
grains, and dairy were obtained from
the USDA's 2010 quarterly data for
grains and dairy.24 The data spanned
99 market groups, 4 regions, and 9 di-
visions. The prices were adjusted for
inflation using the 2015 gross domes-
tic product deflator and converted
from dollars per 100 g to dollars per
ounce. Fruits and vegetable prices
were from the USDA's Fruit and Vege-
table Prices 2013 dataset. Prices were
recorded
in
dollars
per
cup
and
adjusted to 2015 dollars using the
gross domestic product deflator.25
The authors averaged prices for (1)
all fresh, frozen, and canned fruit;
(2) all fresh, frozen, and canned
vegetables;
and
(3)
all
frozen,
canned,
and
dried
beans.
Juice
products were excluded from price
estimates.
To estimate the funds needed to
adhere to a MyPlate diet, SNAP eligi-
bility data by income and household
size
were
used
from
the
USDA's
Food, Nutrition, and Consumer Ser-
vices.26 Review by an institutional
review board was not required for
this study because human subjects
were not involved, as per US Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services
guidelines.27

 Data Analysis
Using the USDA's Economic Research
Service Food Availability Data, the
following MyPlate food groups were
created:
fruits,
vegetables,
protein,
grains, and dairy.28 Using federal die-
tary guidelines for individuals based
on age and gender and retail price
data from the USDA, the cost of
following USDA's MyPlate guidelines
was estimated for consuming 3 daily
meals for the following individuals:
children (aged 2–4 years), children
(aged
5–7
years),
girls
(aged
8–
11 years), girls (aged 12–15 years), girls
(aged 16–17 years), boys (aged 8–
11 years), boys (aged 12–15 years),
boys (aged 16–17 years), female adults
(aged 18–50 years), male adults (ages
18–50 years), female seniors (aged
$51 years), and male seniors (aged
$51 years) (Table 2). Because the fed-
eral dietary guidelines' age categories
are different from the SNAP recipient
age categories,29 USDA MyPlate age
categories were adjusted to correspond
to SNAP recipient age categories. Table 3
shows how corresponding age groups
were created.
In addition, monthly food costs for
a family of 4 were estimated using the
following family composition: a fam-
ily of 4 consisting of 1 male and
female (aged 18–30 years) and 2 chil-
dren (aged 2–4 years and 5–7 years);
and another family of 4 consisting of
1 male and female (aged 31–50) and
2
children
(aged
8–11
years
and
12–17 years). This composition was
chosen to allow for a comparison
with the USDA's Thrifty Food Plan,
which used a similar composition for
a family of 4.19 In estimating the
monthly food costs for adults and a
family of 4, the cost of labor in food
preparation was taken into consid-
eration,
Because
previous
studies
showed that in addition to food costs,
time to prepare meals is a constraining
resource when consuming a healthy
diet.30 Davis and You30 estimated that
the actual cost share of food was 60%
and the cost of labor for preparing
foods accounted for 40% of the total
cost of food. This estimated cost share
of food and labor was used first to esti-
mate
the
total
monthly
costs
of
adhering to a MyPlate diet and then
to compare this monthly cost with
the average monthly SNAP allow-
ances by age and gender. The differ-
ence between the cost of eating 3
meals
daily
according
to
MyPlate
guidelines and the allowance pro-
vided by SNAP for each age and
gender category (Table 4) was then
estimated. In addition to estimating
this cost difference, we also accounted
for the benefit reduction rate (BRR),
which is the percentage of food costs
that individuals pay for on their
own. Based on a previous study by
Ziliak,31 which estimated that with
all of the formal deductions the BRR
ranged from 15% to 20%, a BRR of
20% was used in the current study's
analysis. Assuming a BRR of 20% and
using the average gross income for
all
SNAP
households
of
$786/mo
based on the USDA's 2015 report on
SNAP characteristics, the BRR amount

Description of Scenarios
Although MyPlate guidelines encourage
the intake of fresh, frozen, and canned
fruits and vegetables, the authors esti-
mated the cost of these separately
because the flavor quality varies among
canned, frozen, and fresh fruits and veg-
etables. Processing fruits and vegetables
varies by commodity, and it is likely
that processed forms of produce are
accompanied by changes in flavor qual-
ity, which can influence intake.32,33
Therefore,
to
estimate
the
cost
of
eating 3 daily meals according to
MyPlate
guidelines
for
individuals
and families, 6 scenarios were created
(Table 5). The first scenario estimated
the cost of adhering to a nutritionally
sound diet, including labor cost, if the
recommended daily consumption of
fruits and vegetables were all sourced
fresh. The second scenario estimated
the cost of adhering to a nutritionally
sound diet, including labor cost, if
half of the daily recommended servings
of fruits and vegetables (excluding
beans) were sourced fresh and the other
half were sourced frozen. Another
variation of scenario 2 was created in
which the daily recommended serv-
ings of fruits and vegetables included
beans (scenario 2a). Scenario 3 esti-
mated the cost of adhering to a nutri-
tionally sound diet, including labor
cost, if one-third of the daily recommen-
ded servings of fruits and vegetables
(excluding beans) were sourced fresh,
one-third were frozen, and one-third
were canned. Similar to scenario 2, 2
variations of scenario 3 were calculated:
1 that did not include beans (scenario
3) and 1 that did (scenario 3a). Sce-
narios 4–6 were similar to scenarios
1–3 but catered to a vegetarian diet
in which the main source of protein
consisted of beans instead of lean
meat and eggs.
RESULTS
Table 6 shows the variation in daily
costs of consuming fresh, frozen, and
canned
fruits
and
vegetables,
by
gender and age. Across all gender
and age groups, consuming 100%
fresh fruits and vegetables was the
most expensive diet. Consuming an
equal portion of fresh, frozen, and
canned fruits and vegetables was the
least expensive diet; however, these
cost differences were not statistically
significant.
Table

shows
the
monthly cost required to support a
MyPlate diet, including labor cost by
age, gender, and family size for sce-
narios 1–6. The monthly cost for a
family
of
4
with
2
adults
(aged
31–50 years) and 2 older children
(1 aged 8–11 years and the other
12–17 years) ranged from $1,249/mo
in scenario 1 (when consuming only
fresh fruits and vegetables) to $1,109/
mo in scenario 6 for a vegetarian diet
consuming
one-third
fresh,
frozen,
and canned fruits and vegetables. Simi-
larly, the monthly costs for a family of 4
with 2 adults (aged 19–30 years) and 2
younger children (1 aged 2–4 years
and another aged 5–7 years) ranged
from a high of $1,098/mo in scenario
1 to $930/mo in scenario 6. Table 8

 were to adhere to a nutritionally sound
diet. The scenario with the largest addi-
tional costs across all individuals by
gender, age, and family size was sce-
nario 1. The additional costs needed
on an individual basis was the largest
for boys aged 12–17 years ($75/mo)
and men aged 18–50 years ($72/mo),
because they consumed the largest
quantity of food compared with all
other gender and age groups.
Among families, a family of 4 with
2 adults (aged 31–50 years) and 2 chil-
dren (1 child aged 8–11 years and
another aged 12–17 years) were the
most
financially
vulnerable
to
covering the cost of healthy diets.
This type of family would need to
incur an additional cost of $627/mo
to eat a nutritionally sound diet. Simi-
larly, a family of 4 with 2 adults (aged
18–30 years) and 2 younger children
(1 aged 2–4 years and another aged
5–7 years) would need to incur an
additional cost of $475/mo. Even in
the lowest-cost scenario (scenario 6),
the additional cost needed to support
a healthy diet was still large: $487/mo
for a family of 4 with 2 adults (aged
31–50 years) and 2 children (1 child
aged 8–11 years and another aged
12–17 years); and $308/mo for a
family
of
4
with
2
adults
(aged
31–50 years) and 2 older children (1
child aged 8–11 years and another
aged 12–17 years). Similarly, in sce-
nario 6, boys aged 12–17 years and
men aged 18–50 years would need
additional costs of $50/mo and $32/
mo, respectively, to eat a healthy diet.
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to esti-
mate the total costs, including food
and labor, required to support a My-
Plate diet and the additional costs
needed for SNAP recipients to adhere
to a nutritionally sound diet. When
taking into account the time it takes

aMonthly cost for women and men (aged 18–50 years) were estimated as average costs for men and women in the age groups
18–30 years and 31–50 years; bMonthly cost for women and men aged 18–50 years and aged $51 years and families of 4
included the cost of labor for food preparation, which accounted for 40% of total costs based on the estimates of Davis
et al.30 MyPlate cost of food including labor was estimated as follows: monthly cost/0.6 for each age and gender category
across scenarios; cP for the 2-tailed test tested the difference in monthly costs between the costs of consuming 100% fresh
fruits and vegetables (scenario 1) and the costs of consuming an equal portion of fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and vegeta-
bles (scenario 3) across the different age and gender categories. The difference was not statistically significant at the 5% level.

 to prepare meals, the research found
that the current levels of SNAP bene-
fits plus expected personal expendi-
tures were not enough to cover the
full cost of supporting a diet recom-
mended by MyPlate. This analysis
showed
that
after
accounting
for
BRR, approximately 43% to 60% of
the total monthly food cost including
labor cost was covered by SNAP bene-
fits. The analysis revealed that for a
family of 4 with 2 parents (aged 31–
50 years) and 2 older children (1
aged 8–11 years and the other 12–
17 years), the monthly cost of food
including the cost of labor ranged
from
a
high
of
$1,249
(when
consuming only fresh fruits and vege-
tables) to a low of $1,109 for a vege-
tarian
diet
consuming
one-third
fresh, frozen, and canned fruits and
vegetables.
These estimates were higher than
the 2016 USDA's low-cost food plan
of
$588/mo
for
a
family
of
4
($147.60/wk for a family consisting
of 2 adults aged 20–50 years and 2 chil-
dren aged 2–3 years and 4–5 years).19
In addition, the current estimates
were slightly lower than the USDA's
liberal food plan of $1,276/mo for a
family of 4 ($294.50/wk for a family
consisting of 2 adults aged 20–50 years
and 2 children aged 6–8 years and 9–
11 years).19 Several reasons for the dif-
ferences in monthly cost could be that
the USDA's food plans include other
foods such as gravies and sauces, cof-
fee and tea, soft drinks, sugars and
candies, and soup. In addition, the
model used to calculate the various
food prices plans was based on the lat-
est food consumption trends and food
prices. The estimation in this report
did
not
include
current
food

aNumbers in parentheses indicate that monthly Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) allowance exceeds
monthly cost; bMonthly costs for women and men (aged 18–50 years) were estimated as the average costs for men and women
in the age group 18–30 and 31–50 years; cMonthly cost for women and men aged 18–50 and $51 years and families of 4 include
the cost of labor for food preparation, which account for 60% of total costs based on estimates by Davis and You.30 The My-
Plate cost of food including labor was estimated as the monthly cost/0.60 for each age and gender category across scenarios.
Additional cost was estimated as the MyPlate cost of food including labor minus (SNAP benefits þ BRR), where
BRR ¼ 20% � average monthly gross income of SNAP recipients. According to the US Department of Agriculture (2015),
the average gross income for all SNAP households was $786/mo, and the monthly SNAP benefits were $465 for a family of
4, $127 for female adults, and $126 for male adults

 consumption trends. Finally, the cur-
rent analysis includes the cost of labor
in food preparation.
Compared with the USDA's esti-
mated cost of consuming MyPlate
levels of fruits and vegetables (fresh,
canned, frozen, dried, and 100% juice)
of $2.10 to $2.60 per day, the fresh
fruit and vegetable estimates (scenario
1) ranged from a low of $1.70 for chil-
dren aged 2–3 years to a high of $4.28
for men aged 19–50 years.22 Scenario
3 (which accounts for one-third fresh,
frozen, and canned fruits and vege-
tables) more closely resembles the
USDA's fruit and vegetable cost esti-
mates, with a low of $1.68 for children
aged 2–3 years to a high of $4.22 for
men aged 19–50 years. In addition,
the USDA found that a family of 4
(with 2 parents aged 40 years and 2
children, one aged 8 years and the
other aged 10 years) would need to
spend $61.80/wk on fruits and vegeta-
bles using the thrifty food plan to
satisfy MyPlate dietary guidelines.22
This is considerably less than the cur-
rent estimate of $90.02 for a family
of 4 with 2 children of the same age
using scenario 3. Several reasons for
the cost difference might be that the
USDA's
cost
estimates
were
from
2013 retail prices. Also, that model
included
prices
for
fresh,
frozen,
canned, dried, and juiced products.22
This study had several limitations.
First, because the USDA's age cate-
gories for MyPlate dietary recommen-
dations were different from the SNAP
recipient age categories, the age cate-
gories in this study's model had to be
adjusted. Because of this, the monthly
cost
projections
could
be
slightly
skewed. Second, 6 food cost scenarios
were created that took into account
sourcing fruits and vegetables from
100% fresh produce and a mix of
fresh, frozen, and canned produce, as
well as the cost of vegetarian diets.
The authors recognized that individ-
uals and families do not follow these
simulated scenarios precisely. There-
fore, this study's estimates from the 6
scenarios could vary from the true
monthly costs that individuals spend
on food.
This study calculated the cost of
following MyPlate's dietary recom-
mendations for all food groups (fruits,
vegetables, grains, dairy, and protein),
including the cost of consuming fresh,
frozen, and canned produce. The true
costs, including food prices and labor,
of adhering to the federal dietary guide-
lines were calculated. Results from this
analysis indicated that low-income
families need to incur additional costs
for healthy food consumption as rec-
ommended by the federal dietary
guidelines.
IMPLICATIONS FOR
RESEARCH AND
PRACTICE
Since the 1970s, the US has experi-
enced an increase in largely prevent-
able
chronic
diseases,
including
obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart dis-
ease, that are associated with poor di-
ets. It is estimated that the direct
medical costs of heart disease in the
US account for nearly $270 billion
annually.34
Research
showed
that
increased consumption of fruits and
vegetables according to MyPlate guide-
lines
could
prevent
over
127,000
deaths annually from heart disease, and
the value of this increased longevity
would exceed $11 trillion.35
The Supplemental Nutrition Assis-
tance Program is the largest federal
food assistance program and is effec-
tive at reducing food insecurity while
also improving child and adult health
outcomes.9 Unfortunately, many fam-
ilies receiving SNAP still report signifi-
cant financial barriers to purchasing
healthy food with their benefits.14,15
Current federal proposed budget cuts
to SNAP program decrease the amount
of benefits available for food purchases
and fewer people would have access to
the program.18 An analysis using the
most current data is needed to inform
policy makers regarding the true costs
of healthy eating so that they have
up-to-date research when making pol-
icy decisions. Data related to the cost
of consuming a healthy diet are imper-
ative to informing policy makers.
