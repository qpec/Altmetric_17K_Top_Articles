Introduction
The gut microbiome has been implicated in several 
autoimmune disorders including inflammatory bowel 
disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and MS.6–9Studies in 
experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), a 
mouse model of MS, have shown that perturbation of 
the composition of the gut microbiota affects mice 
susceptibility to develop EAE.10,11 Others have shown 
that colonization of mice with Bacteroides fragilis 
ameliorates EAE and that colonization of mice with 
segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), a Th17 inducer, 
exacerbates 
EAE.9,10 
Tryptophan-derived Aryl 
hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) ligands produced by 
intestinal commensals can reach the central nervous 
system (CNS) to modulate astrocyte function and sup-
press inflammation and neurodegeneration.14 A recent 
study showed that the human gut–derived commensal 
Prevotella suppresses EAE in a human leukocyte anti-
gen (HLA) class II transgenic mouse model.15 We 
have reported alteration in the gut microbiome of MS 
patients.6 Several other groups have also reported dys-
biosis in the gut microbiome of MS subjects.8,9 
Recently, it was shown that high frequency of intesti-
nal TH17 cells correlates with alterations in gut micro-
biota composition as well as increased disease activity 
in MS.16 These findings suggest that manipulation of 
the gut microbiome by the use of probiotics, for exam-
ple, could potentially be beneficial to MS patients. 
Probiotic VSL3 is a cocktail of eight bacteria that has 
a good safety profile. Probiotic VSL3 has been shown 
to induce interleukin (IL)-10+ and IL-10-dependent 
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β)-bearing reg-
ulatory cells in the gut of a mouse model of colitis.17 
Furthermore, VSL3 has been shown to promote an 
anti-inflammatory response in the gut of a mouse 
model of peanut allergy and diabetes.18,19 A recent 
study conducted in antiretroviral therapy (ART)-
treated HIV-1-positive patients reports an association 
between VSL3 administration and decreased T cell 
activation in the peripheral blood and in gut-associated 
lymphoid tissue.20 VSL3 immunomodulatory proper-
ties extend to the CNS. For example, VSL3 has been 
shown to promote neuroprotection in a mouse model 
of traumatic spinal cord injury.21 Another study

Abstract: None of the disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) currently being used for the management 
of multiple sclerosis (MS) are 100% effective. In addition, side effects associated with the use of these 
DMTs have limited the practice of combination therapy. Hence, there is a need for safe immunomodula-
tory agents to fine-tune the management of MS. The gut microbiome plays an important role in autoim-
munity, and several studies have reported alterations in the gut microbiome of MS patients. Studies in 
animal model of MS have identified members of the gut commensal microflora that exacerbate or ame-
liorate neuroinflammation. Probiotics represent an oral, non-toxic immunomodulatory agent that could be 
used in combination with current MS therapy. We designed a pilot study to investigate the effect of VSL3 
on the gut microbiome and peripheral immune system function in healthy controls and MS patients. VSL3 
administration was associated with increased abundance of many taxa with enriched taxa predominated 
by Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium species. At the immune level, VSL3 administra-
tion induced an anti-inflammatory peripheral immune response characterized by decreased frequency of 
intermediate monocytes (CD14highCD16low), decreased mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD80 on 
classical monocytes as well as decreased human leukocyte antigen–antigen D related (HLA-DR) MFI on 
dendritic cells.

reported that VSL3 administration was associated 
with decreased microglial cell activation as well as 
decreased CNS monocytes infiltration leading to 
improve sickness behavior in a mouse model of liver 
inflammation.22 In humans, VSL3 has been shown to 
be beneficial to patients with pouchitis, ulcerative 
colitis, and diabetes.23–25 Very little is known about the 
effect of VSL3 on peripheral immune function in 
humans. Hence, the goal of this study is to investigate 
the effect of probiotic VSL3 on peripheral immune 
function in healthy controls and MS subjects.
Material and methods
Subjects
Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects 
on glatiramer acetate (N = 7) or untreated (N = 2) and 
healthy controls (N = 13) were orally administered 
VSL3 twice daily (total 3600 billion CFU/day) for 2 
months. The MS and control cohorts had comparable 
demographic characteristics except that the MS cohort 
was older (35 ± 14 vs 50 ± 10, p = 0.01) and had higher 
body mass index (BMI; 25.8 ± 4.1 vs 31.1 ± 5.6, p = 
0.03). The subjects enrolled in this study were not on a 
dietary restriction. VSL3 is a probiotic mixture con-
taining 3×1011/g of viable lyophilized bacteria includ-
ing four strains of Lactobacillus (Lactobacillus 
paracasei DSM 24734, Lactobacillus plantarum DSM 
24730, Lactobacillus acidophilus DSM 24735, and 
Lactobacillus 
delbruckeii 
subspecies 
bulgaricus  
DSM 24734), three strains of Bifidobacterium 
(Bifidobacterium longum DSM 24736, Bifidobacterium 
infantis DSM 24737, and Bifidobacterium breve DSM 
24732), and one strain of Streptococcus (Streptococcus 
thermophilus DSM 24731) currently sold in the United 
States under the brand name Visbiome and in Europe 
under the brand name Vivomixx. None of the MS 
patients had an active relapse at the time of study 
enrollment. Stool specimens were collected prior to, at 
discontinuation of therapy, and 3 months thereafter. 
Frozen peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
were used for immune cells profiling. Stool samples 
were used for 16S profiling by Illumina MiSeq. This 
study was approved by the Partners Human Research 
Committee and all participants signed an informed 
consent before any data collection or study procedure.
Sample collection. Stool samples were obtained from 
patients by providing them with stool containers. 
Subjects collected samples produced at anytime of 
day with no specific dietary restrictions. Collection 
containers were then placed in boxes with ice packs 
for immediate shipment to our laboratory via over-
night delivery at a maintained temperature of 0°C. On 
receipt of samples, they were frozen at −80°C until 
DNA extraction.
16S rRNA microbial community profiling. Fecal DNA 
was isolated (MoBio PowerLyzer PowerSoil Kit) and 
the V4 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene was 
amplified using barcoded forward primers (515f, 
926R) from the Earth Microbiome Project1 and http://
www.earthmicrobiome.org/protocols-and-
standards/16s/. Samples were sequenced by paired end 
250 base pair reads at the Harvard Medical School 
Biopolymer Facility using the MiSeq platform (Illu-
mina). Sequence quality was evaluated with FastQC 
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/
fastqc/). The median Phred quality scores were above 
Q30 for the first 230 basepairs and above Q20 for the 
entire sequence for forward read; however, the median 
Phred Q scores for read 2 dropped below Q20 within 
the first 50 bases of the reverse read. Thus, we utilized 
only the forward read of 250 bases, corresponding to 
the V4 region of the microbial 16S rRNA. Down-
stream analysis was performed in QIIME (Qualitative 
Insights into Microbial Ecology).2 Sequences were de-
multiplexed and quality filtered in which reads are 
truncated if two consecutive bases fall below a quality 
score of Q20 (1% error), and reads that are <75% of 
full length are discarded.1 Operational taxonomic units 
(OTUs) were picked using the open reference method 
Sumaclust (http://metabarcoding.org/sumatra) and 
SortMeRNA.3 Taxonomy is picked against the Green-
genes 13.8 release database (http://greengenes.second-
genome.com) using a 97% similarity threshold. Alpha 
diversity was calculated with the phylogenetic diver-
sity_whole_tree, Shannon diversity, and richness met-
rics, and beta diversity was calculated using weighted 
and unweighted UniFrac Distances.
Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. PBMCs 
were isolated by Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient cen-
trifugation (Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Piscat-
away, NJ). The PBMCs were stored in liquid nitrogen 
until use and samples from the same individuals were 
processed and analyzed together to minimize batch-to-
batch variability and to allow for comparisons of mean 
fluorescence intensities (MFIs). All antibodies used for 
surface staining were obtained from Biolegend. The 
viability dyes, violet fluorescent reactive dye (VVD) 
and Efluor 506, were obtained from Life Technologies 
and BD Biosciences respectively. All antibodies were 
titrated to obtain optimal signal-to-noise ratio. Samples 
were acquired using a BD LSR II flow cytometer (BD 
Bioscience) and analyzed using flowjow software.
Statistical analyses. Statistical differences for alpha 
and beta diversities were calculated with PRISM 7.0

software (GraphPad) using paired one-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) with the Tukey post-test to 
assess significance at the 0.05 level and to correct for 
multiple comparisons. Differences in beta-diversity 
visualized on the PCoA plots were calculated with the 
ADONIS test at 999 permutations4 using the R vegan 
package.5 Change over time in fluorescence-activated 
cell sorting (FACS) analyses was assessed using the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test. For this analysis, each pair 
of time points was compared, and the two groups 
were treated separately.
Product tolerability and safety
All study participants were greater than 90% compliant 
with probiotic supplementation. No serious adverse 
reactions were reported by the patients or identified by 
the clinicians. None of the patients experienced a 
relapse during or after probiotic supplementation.
Results
Administration of probiotic VSL3 is associated 
with changes in the structure and composition of 
the gut microbiome in healthy controls and MS 
subjects
Microbial DNA was extracted from fecal samples and 
16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on Illumina 
MiSeq platforms using primers targeting the V4 varia-
ble region. To assess overall differences in microbial 
community structure in MS patients and controls, we 
calculated measures of alpha and beta diversities. Alpha 
diversity is a measurement of the ecological diversity 
within a given sample (i.e. types of microbial species in 
a microbiota sample), whereas beta diversity compares 
the bacterial composition between samples (i.e. whether 
the microbial species are similar between microbiota 
samples). Shannon index, an alpha diversity measure-
ment of both richness (number of species present) and 
evenness (whether there are predominant and rare spe-
cies or equal representation of all species), was meas-
ured at multiple sequencing depths using rarefaction 
curves. We found that administration of VSL3 was 
associated with decreased alpha diversity in healthy 
controls. No change in alpha diversity was observed in 
MS subjects following VSL3 administration.
To determine whether overall microbial community 
structure was different among the three time points, 
we calculated differences in beta diversity using the 
weighted UniFrac metric. Statistical analysis of the 
resulting matrices using the ADONIS test for cluster-
ing revealed that following VSL3 administration, 
there was a change in overall microbial community 
structure in controls (p=0.048, Figure 1). We saw a 
similar trend in MS patients (p=0.10, Figure 1). The 
overall microbial community structure shifted back to 
baseline level following discontinuation of VSL3 in 
controls and MS patients (p=0.58, p=0.54, respec-
tively; Figure 1). We next investigated whether the 
relative abundance of specific bacteria strains differed 
following administration and discontinuation of 
VSL3 in both controls and MS patients.
VSL3 administration was associated with an increase 
in the relative abundance of several species including 
Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and Bifidobacterium 
species in both controls and MS patients. The relative 
abundance of these bacteria strains returned to base-
line following discontinuation of VSL3. Of note, the 
reduced alpha diversity observed in controls most

likely results from the fact that probiotic administra-
tion was associated with an increase in the relative 
abundance of specific bacteria strains, thereby reduc-
ing the evenness within the community and likely 
also competitively reducing the number of other bac-
teria species in controls. We do see a similar trend in 
our MS population, thus the failure to see a statisti-
cally significant change in alpha diversity in MS 
patients may just be a power issue. Alternatively, 
VSL3 may have a more competitive action in controls 
compared to MS patients and limits colonization of 
other microbiota.
VSL3 effect on peripheral immune function
Blood samples from all subjects were collected at 
baseline, 2 months after initiation of VSL3, and at 3 
months post discontinuation of VSL3. PBMCs were 
isolated from these blood samples at all three time 
points and subsequently used for immune cell profil-
ing by flow cytometry. Given prior reports of increased 
latency-associated peptide (LAP) and IL-10+ T regula-
tory cells (T regs) in the gut following VSL3 adminis-
tration, we conducted experiments to investigate the 
effect of probiotic VSL3 on peripheral T regulatory 
cells. No significant change in the relative frequencies 
of 
CD4+CD127lowCD25high,26 
CD4+IL-10+ 
or 
CD39+CD127lowCD25high T regs were observed fol-
lowing administration of VSL3. Discontinuation of 
VSL3 was associated with decreased relative fre-
quency of IL-10+ T regs (2.88% vs 1.63%, p = 0.0269) 
as 
well 
as 
decreased 
relative 
frequency 
of 
CD39+CD127lowCD25high T regs (71.1% vs 66.9%, 
 
p = 0.011) in controls. We also observed a trend toward 
decreased frequency of LAP+ T regs in controls (1.00% 
vs 0.61%, p=0.065). Subsequently, we evaluated the 
frequencies of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. We found a 
trend toward increase in frequency of effector memory 
CD8 T cells following probiotic supplementation in 
MS patients (23.6% vs 30.4%, p = 0.080). The relative 
frequencies of Th1 and Th17 cells were trending down 
following VSL3 administration in both controls and 
MS patients. We also observed that the relative fre-
quency of IL-10+ T regs was trending up following 
VSL3 administration in MS patients.
We did not observe a change in the frequencies of 
naive CD4 or naive CD8 T cells, central memory CD4 
T cells, effector memory CD4 T cells, or central mem-
ory CD8 T cells following VSL3 supplementation in 
our cohort.
Next, we performed immune cell profiling of mono-
cytes from healthy control and MS patients at the three 
time points and found that administration of VSL3 
was associated with decreased frequency of intermedi-
ate monocytes (CD14highCD16low) in MS patients 
(9.07% vs 7.58%, p = 0.039). In controls, we observed 
a trend toward decreased frequency of inflammatory 
monocytes 
(CD14lowCD16high) 
following 
VSL3 
 
supplementation 
(6.15% 
vs 
4.68%, 
p=0.068). 
Discontinuation of VSL3 was associated with 
increased frequency of inflammatory monocytes 
(CD14lowCD16high) in healthy controls (4.68% vs 
7.08%, p = 0.033). In healthy controls, we also 
observed decreased MFI of costimulatory marker 
CD80 on classical monocytes (88 vs 80.6, p=0.048) 
following administration of VSL3. In MS patients, 
we observed decreased MFI of human leukocyte 
antigen–antigen D related (HLA-DR) on myeloid-
derived dendritic cells (CD45+LIN− CD11c+) follow-
ing administration of VSL3 (1890 vs 1510, p = 
0.0156). Of note, we did not observe a change in the 
frequencies of B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and 
myeloid or plasmacytoid dendritic cells following 
administration of VSL3 in our cohort.
Conclusion
Our studies showed that administration of probiotic 
VSL3 was associated with increase in the relative 
abundance of several species with a predominant 
enrichment of Lactobacillus, Streptococcus, and 
Bifidobacterium species in both controls and MS 
patients. At the immune level, VSL3 effect was pre-
dominantly seen on monocytes and dendritic cells. 
VSL3 administration induced an anti-inflammatory 
peripheral innate immune response characterized by 
decreased frequency of intermediate monocytes 
(CD14highCD16low) in MS subjects as well as decreased 
MFI of costimulatory marker CD80 on classical mono-
cytes in controls. In controls, we also found a trend 
toward decreased frequency of inflammatory mono-
cytes following VSL3 supplementation. Administration 
of VSL3 was also associated with decreased MFI of 
HLA-DR 
on 
myeloid-derived 
dendritic 
cells 
(CD45+LIN−CD11c+) in MS subjects. On the other 
hand, discontinuation of VSL3 induced a pro- 
inflammatory immune response characterized by 
increased frequency of inflammatory monocytes 
(CD14lowCD16high) in controls. We also observed 
decreased frequency of IL-10+ T regs in controls as 
well as a trend toward decreased frequency of LAP+ T 
regs following discontinuation of VSL3. Taken 
together, these findings suggest that the use of probiotic 
VSL3 can induce changes in the gut microbiota com-
position that are associated with an anti-inflammatory 
peripheral innate immune response in controls and MS 
patients. These immunomodulatory effects did not per-
sist after discontinuation of VSL3. Additional studies

are needed to validate these findings in a larger MS 
cohort and to determine if VSL3-induced anti-inflam-
matory peripheral immune response is associated with 
improved disease outcome in MS patients.
