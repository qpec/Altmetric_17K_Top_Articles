ABSTRACT
Within-city variation in air pollution has been associated with childhood asthma
development, but findings have been inconsistent. We examined whether perinatal air pollution exposure
affected asthma onset during “pre-school and “school age” periods in a population-based birth cohort.
65254 children born between 1999 and 2002 in the greater Vancouver metropolitan region were
followed until age 10 years using linked administrative health databases. Asthma cases were sex- and
age-matched to five randomly chosen controls. Associations between exposure to air pollutants estimated
with different methods (interpolation (inverse-distance weighted (IDW)), land use regression, proximity)
and incident asthma during the pre-school (0–5 years) and school age (6–10 years) periods were estimated
with conditional logistic regression.
6948 and 1711 cases were identified during the pre-school and school age periods, respectively.
Following adjustment for birthweight, gestational period, household income, parity, breastfeeding at
discharge, maternal age and education, asthma risk during the pre-school years was increased by traffic
pollution (adjusted odds ratio using IDW method per interquartile increase (95% CI): nitric oxide 1.06
(1.01–1.11), nitrogen dioxide 1.09 (1.04–1.13) and carbon monoxide 1.05 (1.01–1.1)). Enhanced impacts
were observed amongst low-term-birthweight cases. Associations were independent of surrounding
residential greenness.
Within-city air pollution variation was associated with new asthma onset during the pre-school years.

AIR POLLUTION AND ASTHMA
 Introduction
Asthma is the most common paediatric respiratory disease, and presents a heavy and costly burden [1].
Both environmental and genetic factors play a role in asthma development [2]. Among environmental
factors, air pollution has attracted interest because of its link to asthma severity, its ubiquitous nature and
the possibility of preventive strategies via exposure reduction [3]. One built environment feature that may
reduce air pollution exposure is the presence of green spaces. While the evidence linking childhood asthma
with green spaces is scarce and inconsistent [4–7], they may also influence asthma 1) by providing space
for increased physical activity, 2) by increasing exposure to microbial diversity and/or pollen, and 3)
through directly reducing stress [8].
Qualitative reviews have suggested causal associations [9, 10] between traffic-related air pollution
specifically with incident childhood asthma, although recent analyses of the epidemiological evidence
indicate divergent results.. Examining within-community variation in air pollution [11] or that from traffic
sources [12], meta-analyses reported associations with childhood asthma. However, no evidence of an
association was found among children followed up until age 10 years in the ESCAPE (European Study of
Cohorts for Air Pollution Effects) analysis of multiple birth cohorts using a common exposure protocol
[13]. Possible explanations for these inconsistent findings could be heterogeneity in the impacts of air
pollution on different asthma phenotypes [14] at different stages of childhood development or
modification by other risk factors. Here, we utilise a 10-year follow-up of over 65000 children to build
upon the previous literature and previous work in a subset of this cohort [15] to examine whether air
pollution differentially impacted asthma risk during two age periods (“pre-school” and “school age”). We
further evaluated whether associations were modified by socioeconomic status, sex, parity, birth outcomes
and spatially covarying green space.
Methods
Cohort description
A birth cohort was identified using British Columbia (BC) administrative data (Ministry of Health [16, 17],
Vital Statistics Agency [18, 19], Perinatal Services BC [20]), through Population Data BC [21] which provides
data linkage, development and access to the health services database. This cohort comprised all 1999–2002 live
births to mothers who were registered with the provincial universal health insurance programme and who
resided for their complete pregnancy in the greater Vancouver metropolitan region [22]. The study protocol
was approved by the University of British Columbia Research Ethics Board (H04-80161).
Children were followed for 10 years provided they continued to reside in the province according to BC
Ministry of Health registry data [21]. Members were lost to follow-up if they moved outside the study
region or had a gap of >6 months in residency. From the 73387 births to mothers with verified residential
history in the study area, children were excluded if they died during follow-up (n=101), were a multiple
birth (n=988) or had missing covariate information (n=4103), leaving 68195 singletons.
Incident asthma case definition
Asthma diagnoses for 1999–2009 were identified from physician billing and hospital discharge records [16, 17]
(International Classification of Diseases revision 9: 493; revision 10: J45), obtained from the BC Ministry of
Health. Using a validated case definition of asthma [23], children with a minimum of two primary-care
physician diagnoses or one hospital admission in a rolling 12-month period were identified as asthma cases. A
nested case–control design was adopted for analytic efficiency.
Exposure assessment
Exposure variables were assigned throughout pregnancy for cases and controls, based on residential postal
codes recorded at each contact with the healthcare system. A time-weighted average exposure
incorporating residential mobility during pregnancy was calculated by the time spent at each postal code
and successfully assigned to 65254 study subjects with complete covariate information.
Exposure to air pollution for each cohort member was assigned at their residential six-digit postal code(s),
which corresponds to one block-face in urban areas (typically 100–150 m), by three different approaches
[22]: land use regression (LUR) models, interpolation of regulatory monitoring data (BC Ministry of
Environment and Metro Vancouver) and proximity measures.
LUR models provided high spatial resolution (30 m precision) estimates of exposures to traffic-related air
pollutants, including black carbon (BC), fine particulate matter (<2.5 µm, PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
and nitric oxide (NO) [22, 24]. Since the temporal stability of LUR surfaces showed reasonable backward
predictions [25], each LUR model, developed after the cohort inception period, was temporally adjusted
based on daily air monitoring measurements to estimate monthly average concentrations which were
assigned to individual subjects’ residential postal codes during pregnancy.

 Measurements of NO2, NO, BC, PM10, carbon monoxide (CO) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) from regulatory
monitoring stations were used to compute the inverse-distance weighted (IDW) averages from the three
closest monitors within 50 km, and assigned to participants’ residential postal codes [26].
Finally, we determined whether a home postal code was within 50 or 150 m of a primary highway, within
50 or 150 m of a major road, or within 150 m of a primary highway and within 50 m of a major road for
each cohort member using a geographic database (DMTI ArcView street file data set for BC, Canmap
Streetfiles version 2006.3; DMTI Spatial, Markham, Ontario, Canada).
Covariates
Birth date, sex, birthweight and gestational duration for each child were accessed via Vital Statistics data
[18]. Parity (used as surrogate for presence of siblings), breastfeeding status at the time of discharge, and
maternal age and smoking during pregnancy were obtained from the BC Perinatal Data Registry [20].
Since no individual-level data were available for other socioeconomic factors, we assigned subjects to
measures of income and maternal education at the Census Dissemination Areas [27], a resolution which
approximates the neighbourhood-level, with target populations of 400–700 persons.
Analytical methods
Each asthma case was randomly matched to five controls by sex and birth month and year, and analysed with
nested conditional logistic regression models including breastfeeding status at the time of discharge, parity,
maternal education (area-level quartiles), household income (area-level quintiles), gestational length and
birthweight. We examined the risk of incident asthma in relation to air pollution: from birth until the child’s
sixth birthday (“pre-school”) and from age 6 years until the end of follow-up (“school age”). The pre-school
group was similar to an initial analysis of a subsample of this cohort [15], while the school age group
provided insight into the effect of perinatal air pollution exposure on asthma incidence later in childhood. As
air pollution and surrounding residential greenness covary independently, we also adjusted for this exposure,
assigned for the same time window [28], in sensitivity analyses. Greenness was measured using the
satellite-derived Normalised Difference Vegetation Index based on 30-m resolution images and characterised
for a 100-m buffer around the home residential postal codes. Pollutants were entered into models as
continuous variables to calculate odds ratios (ORs) over an interquartile increase (table 2) following an
assessment of the functional relationship between asthma incidence and air pollutants based on smoothing
splines (gam function, The R Project for Statistical Computing 2.15.0; http://www.r-project.org). As most of
the relationships were found to be close to linear for a wide range of the data (online supplementary figure
S1), analyses by exposure quartile were also conducted to assess exposure–response relationships.
Potential modifications of the air pollution effects on childhood asthma incidence by low term birthweight
(<2500 g), prematurity (30–37 and <30 weeks), sex, parity, maternal age at birth, neighbourhood-level
household income and maternal post-secondary education were examined in sensitivity analyses.
Results
Age (mean±SD) at time of first asthma diagnosis was 2.6±1.4 years for 6948 children who met the case
definition of asthma between birth through age 5 years and 7.0±1.2 years for 1711 school age children.
Asthmatic children were more frequently born to a younger mother, with a smaller birthweight and gestation
period, from a lower socioeconomic stratum, and less likely to have been breastfed, compared with their
matched controls. All risk factors, except for sex, were similar when comparing matched controls to all
children who did not meet the case definition, indicating nonbiased selection of control subjects (table 1).
Table 2 summarises the distribution of all spatially derived exposure variables for the cohort strata. Levels
of air pollutants in metropolitan Vancouver were relatively low and positively intercorrelated (except for
ozone) as reported previously [15]. There were differences in mean exposure levels for LUR compared
with IDW metrics, in particular for NO (23 versus 31 µg·m−3 for IDW and LUR, respectively), reflecting
the enhanced spatial precision of LUR models. Estimated exposures were significantly different between
cases and matched controls for IDW-derived NO2 and ozone.
For children with a diagnosis of asthma established in the pre-school years, all interpolation-based
exposures except for ozone were positively associated with an increased risk in adjusted models. In
addition, proximity to highways and major roads significantly increased the risk of new asthma onset by
25% and 5%, respectively (table 3). The associations with ozone were negatively correlated with asthma
incidence due to the negative correlation of ozone with traffic-related air pollutants. These results were
consistent with exposures categorised in quartiles (figure 1a).
For both continuous and categorical exposures, all adjusted analyses were robust to the inclusion of
additional risk factors (breastfeeding status at discharge, parity, maternal education level and age, income,

 birthweight, and gestational length) with ORs showing similar direction and magnitude of effects as crude
analyses. Supplementary analyses (results not shown) using nonparametric regression (locally weighted
scatterplot smoothing) confirmed linearity between predicted probabilities for incident asthma throughout
the distribution of air pollutant concentrations.
Children for whom incident asthma was only evident from age 6 years onwards showed no consistently
elevated risk in relation to air pollutant exposures (table 3). Only exposure to PM10 exhibited some
consistency between the two time periods (figure 1), while ozone exposure was associated with an
increased risk of developing asthma after 6 years of age (adjusted OR (95% CI) 1.18 (1.07–1.31)). As most
new asthma onset cases were captured during the pre-school period, more investigation is needed to
confirm the observed associations during the school age period.
Effect modification
Stratified regression analyses were conducted only for the pre-school period since this accounted for 70%
of all identified cases and stratified models for the school age period did not converge.
Among children who met the case definition during the pre-school period, 535 (7.7% of all incident
asthma cases) were born at 30–37 weeks of gestation and only 83 (1.2%) at <30 weeks. Gestational
duration was grouped into a single pre-term category (<37 weeks) to ensure model convergence.
Evidence of effect modification by term birthweight but not gestational duration was demonstrated (figure 2).
All the increased risks for children with birthweight <2500 g (n=442), for IDW-derived pollutant exposures,
were near double those in children with birthweight ⩾2500 g. Low-term-birthweight children also showed
increased risk for LUR exposure estimates.
Stratified regressions by sex revealed that girls were consistently at increased odds of new asthma compared
with boys for the same air pollutants identified in the main analysis (online supplementary figure S2).
Stratification by parity showed similar but less pronounced results: all exposures with an effect on odds of

 asthma in the main analysis, except PM10, showed a heightened impact for children without siblings
(online supplementary figure S2).
Children born in neighbourhoods of lower socioeconomic status (based on neighbourhood income and
education) demonstrated higher odds of asthma associated with IDW-derived air pollutant exposures
(online supplementary figure S3). Stratification by maternal age at birth showed less consistent results:
relative to IDW-derived air pollutants, both the oldest and youngest mothers were likely to have children
at higher odds of new asthma development, while LUR estimates showed some increasing trend with age.
Formal testing confirmed statistically significant interactions terms for birthweight, sex, parity and
socioeconomic status measured by area-level household income for pollutants related to vehicular
emissions (NO, NO2 and CO).
Given that levels of surrounding greenness in the study area were modestly correlated with the examined
air pollutants, joint effects models showed independent and stable effects of air pollution on asthma
incidence, except for PM10 (online supplementary tables S1 and S3).
Discussion
In one of the largest population-based birth cohort studies to examine within-community air pollution
contrasts, we found a 25% increased odds of new asthma onset for children of mothers living near
highways during pregnancy, and 5–10% increases for interquartile range increases in NOx and CO derived
using IDW. Similar to an earlier analysis of a subset of this cohort [15], we also observed positive
associations with PM10 and SO2 exposure [15]. Exposures to air pollution generally did not affect asthma
onset when the child was older than age 6 years.

AIR POLLUTION AND ASTHMA | H. SBIHI ET AL.
 The most recent birth cohort studies with similar follow-up durations show mixed results with regard to the
role of air pollution on asthma incidence. A British birth cohort reported no association between NO2 nor
PM10 and asthma in children who were followed up until 11 years of age [29]. The Swedish BAMSE
(Children, Allergy, Milieu, Stockholm, Epidemiological Survey) cohort reported a positive association
between air pollution and asthma only among older children [30], although the number of identified cases in
BAMSE at increasing ages did not follow the decreasing pattern found in our study. However, similar to our
analysis, the Dutch PIAMA (Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy) cohort [31] reported
positive associations between NO2 and asthma at age 2 and 4 years [32, 33] with most incident cases
apparent earlier in life. Unlike in our study, however, the increased risk of incident asthma in relation to
NO2 and PM2.5 exposure was still evident for incident asthma at older ages (up to age 8 years), possibly due
to higher air pollution levels [31].
In both PIAMA and BAMSE, asthma was defined based on questionnaires, unlike this study where
medical records were used. Furthermore, as the BAMSE case definition was augmented in later ages by
adding the use of medication, differences in asthma case definitions can also explain the difference in
results. Our asthma case definition, although verified in other population-based administrative data
analyses [34, 35], relied on healthcare system encounters and may have captured wheezing illnesses that
have varying trajectories over time [36]. Transient wheezing is common in infants and often resolves in
childhood [37]. In a population-based Canadian study, half the children diagnosed with asthma before age
6 years went into remission by age 12 years [38]. While the pre-school analysis may have included children
whose symptoms resolved later, weakening the ability to detect associations during school years,
misclassification is unlikely as among those children diagnosed prior to age 6 years, 77% remained

 asthmatic in later childhood (results not shown). A recent position paper on the diagnosis of asthma in
pre-schoolers supported the importance of early age diagnoses [39]. Future studies of asthma trajectories
using linked health databases can help elucidate asthma phenotypes where incidence is affected by
air pollution.
Administrative data are not collected for research purposes and lack individual-level information
(e.g. socioeconomic status measures), and therefore may be subject to residual confounding. Similarly,
adjustment for parental asthma was not available in the linked health databases and remains an intrinsic
limitation
of
this
population-based
investigation.
However,
such
linked
health
records
provide
unprecedented opportunities to investigate multiple risk factors in a large population. The population-based
study design reduces the potential for bias, including that related to genetic factors.
For all air pollutants apart from PM10 and for road proximity metrics, the direction and magnitude of
effects did not change when controlling for surrounding greenness. This finding is consistent with our
observation of an association in this cohort between increased greenness and reduced asthma incidence
that remained even when air pollution exposure was considered [40]. Despite the ability of LUR exposure
assessments to provide increased spatial precision, associations were consistently larger for IDW estimates
compared with LUR estimates. This result is line with previous investigations in this cohort examining the
effect of traffic-related air pollution on birth outcomes [22] and asthma in early life [15], and suggests that
LUR may be more relevant for primary pollutants such as NO and black carbon. A previous study
evaluated these and several other exposure metrics, and suggested that interpolation and LUR estimates
reflect different spatial scales which may be partially independent of each other [26]. Both types of
exposure estimates, whether derived using LUR or IDW, showed only modest (although somewhat higher
with LUR) correlations, with personal monitoring in a study of pregnant women in Vancouver [41]
suggesting that both IDW and LUR capture partially independent components of personal exposure to the
traffic-related air pollution mixture. Our findings should also be considered in light of the limitation that

 exposures in microenvironments other than the home during pregnancy were not considered, leading to
potential exposure misclassification. Indeed, in the NETHERY et al. [41] study of pregnant women in
Vancouver, better agreement with personal exposure was shown when work/school addresses were
included. However, GRUZIEVA et al. [30] reported in their analysis where several microenvironments were
considered that early life exposures would be less affected by the threat of misclassification when
considering home addresses only. In the absence of linked residential histories throughout the follow-up
period, no formal comparison of pregnancy and post-natal exposures was conducted. This limitation may
be partially offset by a prior investigation of a subset of this cohort which suggested that pre-natal
exposures had a slightly larger impact on asthma compared with exposures in the first years of life [15].
Pre-school children weighing <2500 g at birth were consistently, across all metrics, at increased risk for
new asthma onset in relation to air pollution exposure, supporting the idea of greater susceptibility among
low-birthweight subpopulations [42].
Similar to the Children’s Health Study results [43], being born to a nulliparous mother increased the risk
of asthma incidence. This observation may reflect the importance of the in utero environment, given
evidence of reduced proliferative responses in cord blood mononuclear cells with increasing parity [44].
We also confirmed the previously observed effect modification of air pollution’s effects on childhood
respiratory morbidity by socioeconomic status [45]. Furthermore, children born to older mothers were at
higher risk of being impacted by air pollution exposure, a relevant finding as BC has the highest
proportion of mothers giving birth over the age of 35 years in Canada [46].
In conclusion, the majority of incident asthma occurred during the pre-school years. During this period,
the impact of air pollution on asthma incidence was enhanced among low-term-birthweight children.
