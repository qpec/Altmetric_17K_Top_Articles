Abstract
Study Design—Prospective Cohort
Background—The high risk of second ACL injuries after return-to-sport highlights the 
importance of return-to-sport decision-making. Objective return-to-sport criteria frequently use 
LSI’s to quantify quadriceps strength and hop scores. Whether using the uninvolved limb in LSI’s 
is optimal is unknown.
Objectives—To evaluate the uninvolved limb as a reference standard for limb symmetry indexes 
(LSI’s) utilized in return-to-sport testing and its relationship with second ACL injury rates.
Methods—Seventy athletes completed quadriceps strength and 4 single-legged hop tests before 
ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and 6 months after ACLR. LSI’s for each test compared involved 
limb measures at 6 months to uninvolved measures at 6 months. Estimated pre-injury capacity 
(EPIC) levels for each test compared involved measures at 6 months to uninvolved measures 
before ACLR. Second ACL injuries were tracked for a minimum 2-year follow-up after ACLR.
Results—Forty (57.1%) patients achieved 90% LSI’s for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. 
Only 20 (28.6%) patients met 90% EPIC levels (comparing involved limb at 6 months after ACLR 
to uninvolved limb before ACLR) for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. Twenty-four (34.4%) 
patients who achieved 90% LSI’s for all measures 6 months after ACLR did not achieve 90% 
EPIC levels for all measures. EPIC levels were more sensitive to LSI’s in predicting second ACL 
injuries (LSI’s: 0.273 (95% CI: 0.010–0.566); EPIC: 0.818 (95% CI: 0.523–0.949)).
Conclusion—LSI’s frequently overestimate knee function after ACLR and may be related to 
second ACL injury risk. These findings raise concern whether the variable ACL return-to-sport

INTRODUCTION
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury frequently results in muscle weakness, poor knee 
function, and increased risk for second injury despite surgical reconstruction 
(ACLR).2,8,15,17–20 Overall second ACL injury rates reaching upwards of 49%3 suggest 
inadequacy in current criteria used to determine an athlete’s readiness to return-to-sport. 
Adherence to objective return-to-sport criteria reduces re-injury risk,8 but criteria used to 
clear patients for return-to-sport is not standardized and varies considerably.3 Evidence to 
establish optimal objective levels of knee function that maximize functional outcomes and 
protect against second ACL injury is needed.
Objective return-to-sport criteria often utilize measures of quadriceps strength and single-
legged hop tests, with limb to limb differences typically expressed as limb symmetry indexes 
(LSI’s).3 LSI’s use concurrent measures of the uninvolved limb as a reference standard. 
While the uninvolved limb is widely used as a “healthy” control, bilateral muscle strength 
deficits have been demonstrated after ACL injury11,16,20 challenging the validity of 
symmetry measures in objective return-to-sport criteria. It is unknown if measurements of 
the uninvolved limb prior to ACLR provide a better reference than LSI’s during return-to-
sport testing. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the uninvolved limb as a 
reference standard for symmetry indexes utilized in return-to-sport testing and its 
relationship with second ACL injury rates. Preliminary evidence is presented to demonstrate 
potential benefits of using uninvolved limb function prior to instead of after ACLR to 
determine return-to-sport readiness. We hypothesized that the involved limb function of 
athletes after ACLR would more frequently match uninvolved limb function measured 
concurrently after ACLR compared to uninvolved limb function measured before ACLR, 
and that EPIC levels would better predict second ACL injuries than LSI’s.
METHODS
Athletes active in cutting and pivoting activities4 before complete, unilateral ACL injury 
between the ages of 14–55 were secondarily analyzed within a completed randomized 
control trial and an ongoing prospective clinical trial.6,9 Exclusion criteria included a 
repairable meniscus, symptomatic grade III injury to other knee ligaments, >1 cm2 full-
thickness articular cartilage lesion, or prior ACL injury. This study was approved by the 
University of Delaware Human Subjects Review Board and all patients provided written 
informed consent.

 Patients completed 2 testing sessions before ACLR ((Testing 1) quadriceps strength testing 
initially after ACL injury; (Testing 2) single-legged hop testing following initial impairment 
resolution after ACL injury) and 1 testing session after ACLR (Testing 3: quadriceps 
strength testing and single-legged hop testing 6 months after ACLR) (FIGURE 1). 
Quadriceps strength was tested bilaterally in 90 degrees of knee flexion by recording 
maximal voluntary isometric contractions using the burst superimposition technique to 
ensure normal quadriceps activation12 during the initial physical therapy evaluation acutely 
after ACL injury. Patients continued rehabilitation prior to ACLR until initial impairments 
were resolved (effusion, range of motion, pain, gait impairments, quadriceps strength)12 and 
hop testing could be safely completed (second testing session). Four single-legged hop tests 
(single, crossover, triple hop for distance; 6-meter timed) were completed on each limb 
(uninvolved first).15 After 2 practice trials, the average of 2 trials was recorded in each limb 
for each hop test.
Patients underwent progressive, criterion-based post-operative rehabilitation early after 
ACLR1 and then repeated quadriceps strength and single-legged hop testing 6 months after 
ACLR (Testing 3) with LSI’s calculated (see FIGURE 1). Six-month testing was chosen 
because it is a common time to begin sporting activities.3 Symmetry was defined using a 
cut-off of 90% in accordance with established University of Delaware return-to-sport criteria 
requiring 90% or greater LSI’s in quadriceps strength and all 4 single-legged hop tests 
within a larger test battery.1 Return-to-sport criteria for included subjects also required at 
least 90% on the Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale, and Global Rating 
Score of Knee Function prior to physician clearance for returning-to-sport.1 An LSI of 85–
90% or greater is common in other published return-to-sport criteria18,19 and thought to 
account for normal levels of interlimb asymmetry.13,21
In addition to computing LSI’s 6 months after ACLR, estimated pre-injury capacity (EPIC) 
levels were calculated by comparing the involved limb function at 6 months to uninvolved 
scores prior to ACLR (FIGURE 1). A 90% cut-off was operationally defined as achieving 
EPIC levels for quadriceps strength and hop scores.
At subsequent follow-up testing patients reported if they had incurred second ACL injuries 
during a minimum 2-year follow-up. All second injuries were confirmed by a licensed 
physician or physical therapist.
Statistical analyses were completed using PASSW 23.0 software (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). 
Correlational analyses were used to test if time from ACL injury to initial uninvolved testing 
(before ACLR) influenced EPIC levels. Sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative 
likelihood ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to assess the ability of 
LSI’s and EPIC levels to determine second ACL injury risk.10 Statistical significance was 
set at α≤0.05.
RESULTS
The initial cohort eligible for this study included 182 patients. Thirty-seven subjects 
completed non-operative management of ACL injury, 9 did not complete hop testing prior to

 ACLR, 6 did not complete hop testing 6 months after ACLR, 28 did not return for testing 6 
months after ACLR, and 32 were excluded to avoid unreliable EPIC measurements due the 
use of different electromechanical dynamometers for quadriceps strength testing at each 
testing session. Thus, 70 patients (26.6±10.0 years; 32.9% women; BMI 24.9±3.8 kg/m2) 
were used in the current analysis.
Patients completed initial uninvolved quadriceps strength testing 1.5±2.0 months and single-
legged hop tests 1.9±2.1 months after ACL injury. ACLR occurred 4.4±4.0 months after 
injury (28 hamstring gracilis autograft, 42 soft tissue allograft). The time from ACL injury to 
initial uninvolved testing did not impact strength or hop EPIC levels (p: 0.400–0.892, 
Pearson r: -0.108–0.037).
Forty (57.1%) patients achieved 90% LSI’s for quadriceps strength and all single-legged hop 
tests. Only 20 (28.6%) patients met 90% EPIC levels (comparing involved limb at 6 months 
after ACLR to uninvolved limb before ACLR) for quadriceps strength and all hop tests. 
Twenty-four (34.4%) patients who achieved 90% LSI’s for all measures 6 months after 
ACLR did not achieve 90% EPIC levels for all measures. TABLE 1 provides details for why 
90% LSI’s and EPIC levels were not achieved. When LSI’s and EPIC levels were not 
achieved, mean quadriceps strength and hops scores ranged from 5.1%-14.6% below 90% 
cut-off values (TABLE 2).
Eleven patients sustained a second ACL injury (ACLR to second injury: median: 78 wks; 
range: 27–276 wks) (TABLE 3). Eight (4 ipsilateral, 4 contralateral) of the 11 patients with a 
second ACL injury passed 90% LSI return-to-sport criteria in quadriceps strength and 
single-legged hop tests 6 months after initial ACLR, but 6 (4 ipsilateral, 2 contralateral) of 
these 8 did not achieve 90% EPIC levels in these measures. Achieving 90% EPIC levels was 
superior to 90% LSI’s in predicting second ACL injuries (LSI’s: sensitivity: 0.273 (95% CI: 
0.010–0.566), specificity: 0.542 (95% CI: 0.417–0.663), positive likelihood ratio: 0.596 
(95% CI: .218–1.627), negative likelihood ratio: 1.341 (95% CI: 0.871–2.064); EPIC: 
sensitivity: 0.818 (95% CI: 0.523–0.949), specificity: 0.305 (95% CI: 0.203–0.432), positive 
likelihood ratio: 1.177 (95% CI: 0.850–1.631), negative likelihood ratio: 0.596 (95% CI: 
0.161–2.212)).
DISCUSSION
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the uninvolved limb as a reference standard for 
symmetry indexes utilized in return-to-sport testing and its relationship with second ACL 
injury rates. The results of this study demonstrate that achievement of limb symmetry in 
quadriceps strength and single-legged hop tests after ACLR does not guarantee prior 
functional levels (per the uninvolved limb before ACLR) have been met. Forty of 70 patients 
met University of Delaware return-to-sport criteria of at least 90% symmetry in quadriceps 
strength and 4 single-legged hop tests 6 months after ACLR, but only 16 of these 40 patients 
achieved 90% EPIC levels when comparing the involved limb at 6 months to uninvolved 
limb function prior to ACLR. Preliminary data suggests that the use of 90% EPIC levels is 
superior to 90% LSI’s in predicting second ACL injuries.

 The lower number of patients who met 90% EPIC levels compared to 90% LSI’s may be 
explained by current criterion-based pre-operative and post-operative rehabilitation that 
focuses on unilateral strengthening and neuromuscular training.1 The uninvolved limb likely 
experiences limited physical activity beyond walking and activities of daily living during the 
extended period between injury and return-to-sport, a drastic decline from demands faced 
during pre-injury levels of sports activities. Reduced physical activity levels may result in 
compensatory adaptations by a subgroup of patients with ACL injury including decreased 
muscle strength in the uninvolved leg after ACL injury.11,16,20 Decreased function and 
performance of the uninvolved limb over time will produce inflated limb symmetry indexes 
and may misrepresent the functional ability of the ACL-injured limb.
Eight of 11 patients who suffered a second ACL injury passed 90% LSI return-to-sport 
criteria for quadriceps strength and single-legged hop tests 6 months after ACLR. However, 
6 of the 8 (4 ipsilateral, 2 contralateral) who met return-to-sport criteria did not meet 90% 
EPIC levels in all measures. It is possible that athletes who attained 90% LSI’s but not 90% 
EPIC levels 6 months after ACLR had remaining bilateral functional deficits that were 
unresolved after return-to-sport activities were resumed. Persistent bilateral functional 
impairments could be a factor in the incidence of both ipsilateral and contralateral second 
ACL injuries in our cohort, and the significantly increased risk of both ipsilateral and 
contralateral second ACL injuries which has previously been reported early after athletes 
return-to-sport.17 The small sample of patients in our study with second ACL injury likely 
resulted in the large sensitivity and specificity confidence intervals present. Further study is 
needed with a larger cohort of patients with second ACL injury to validate the current 
preliminary findings.
Few studies have examined alternate measurements to LSI’s to compare the function and 
performance of the involved limb after ACLR. Prospective pre-season functional testing of 
athletes is the ideal criterion to provide patient-specific rehabilitation milestones after injury. 
Pre-injury functional data would eliminate the limitation of EPIC measurements which 
requires pre-operative testing of the uninvolved limb. However, pre-injury testing requires 
extensive resources and time commitments making widespread implementation in high 
school, college, and recreational settings unrealistic. The benefit of including pre-operative 
rehabilitation on post-operative outcomes after ACL injury is clear,7 and this period presents 
an opportunity for objective measurement of baseline uninvolved limb function to later 
compare the involved limb during return-to-sport testing. Age, sex, and sports matched 
normative values present an alternative strategy to patient-specific pre-injury data and EPIC 
measurements but are not widely developed.5,14
The high number of patients who passed return-to-sport criteria but failed to meet levels of 
knee function in the uninvolved limb present prior to ACLR raises concerns regarding 
current return-to-sport practice guidelines. Despite evidence that stringent objective return-
to-sport criteria minimizes the risk of additional knee injury,8 the requirement for only 80–
85% symmetry or absence of any objective criteria is frequent.3 The cut-off of 90% 
symmetry within this study as part of the University of Delaware return-to-sport criteria 
represents one of the most demanding criteria published and currently used in ACL return-

 to-sport testing.1,3 However, even when meeting these strict criteria, symmetry measures 
underestimated the baseline functional performance of many patients.
The current findings provide grounds for discussion regarding the validity of limb symmetry 
and current return-to-sport criteria utilized after ACL injury. The nature of the current 
analysis limits our ability to develop strong conclusions whether utilizing EPIC 
measurements is superior to LSI’s in decreasing risk of second ACL injuries because EPIC 
levels were not computed during 6-month functional testing. Thus, further bilateral 
strengthening and neuromuscular training to achieve 90% EPIC levels were not 
implemented. Other limitations include a small sample size, the low occurrence of second 
ACL injuries, and cohort attrition (including patients tested on different dynamometers). 
However, the current study does highlight the need for rigorous testing of objective return-
to-sport criteria to establish best practice for safe clearance to sport and improve rates of 
second ACL injury. Determination of the most valid and reasonable reference on which to 
compare the function of the involved limb must be included.
CONCLUSION
Even with the use of rigorous return-to-sport criteria, recovery of knee function is frequently 
overestimated when using measures of limb symmetry. Preliminary evidence suggests the 
inability to restore knee function exhibited prior to ACLR may increase risk for second ACL 
injuries. The current findings raise concern whether the variable return-to-sport criteria 
utilized in current clinical practice after ACL injury are stringent enough to achieve a safe 
and successful return-to-sport.

Findings
Achievement of limb symmetry in quadriceps strength and single-legged hop tests after 
ACLR does not guarantee prior functional levels (per the uninvolved limb) have been 
met. Preliminary data suggests that the use of 90% EPIC levels is superior to 90% LSI’s 
in predicting second ACL injuries.
Implications
The current findings raise concern whether the variable return-to-sport criteria utilized in 
current clinical practice after ACL injury are stringent enough to achieve a safe and 
successful return-to-sport.
Caution
EPIC levels were not computed at the time of 6 month functional testing; thus, is not 
known whether further rehabilitation to attain 90% EPIC levels would have resulted in 
improved outcomes.
