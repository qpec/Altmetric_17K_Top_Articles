ABSTRACT
Context: Posterior cervical cages have recently become available as an alternative to lateral mass fixation in patients undergoing cervical 
spine surgery.
Aims: The purpose of this study was to quantify the perioperative complications associated with cervical decompression and fusion in patients 
treated with a posterior cervical fusion (PCF) and bilateral cages.
Settings and Design: A retrospective, multicenter review of prospectively collected data was performed at 11 US centers.
Subjects and Methods: The charts of 89 consecutive patients with cervical radiculopathy treated surgically at one level with PCF and 
cages were reviewed. Three cohorts of patients were included standalone primary PCF with cages, circumferential surgery, and patients with 
postanterior cervical discectomy and fusion pseudarthrosis. Follow‑up evaluation included clinical status and pain scale (visual analog scale).
Statistical Analysis Used: The Wilcoxon test was used to test the differences for the data. The P level of 0.05 was considered significant.
Results: The mean follow‑up interval was 7 months (range: 62 weeks ‑ 2 years). The overall postsurgery complication rate was 4.3%. There 
were two patients with neurological complications (C5 palsy, spinal cord irritation). Two patients had postoperative complications after discharge 
including one with atrial fibrillation and one with a parietal stroke. After accounting for relatedness to the PCF, the overall complication rate was 
3.4%. The average (median) hospital stay for all three groups was 29 h.
Conclusions: The results of our study show that PCF with cages can be considered a safe alternative for patients undergoing cervical spine 
surgery. The procedure has a favorable overall complication profile, short length of stay, and negligible blood loss.

INTRODUCTION
Ongoing technological developments have given the 
surgeon, a wide armamentarium of options to treat cervical 
spine diseases. Facet distraction as a treatment for cervical 
spondylotic radiculopathy and myelopathy was described 
by Goel.[1‑4] (US Patent No. 9668783 B2 ‑ Goel ‑ Devices and 
method for spondylotic disease) Posterior cervical cages 
(Goel facetal spacers) have recently become available as an 
alternative to lateral mass fixation (LMF) to achieve cervical 
fusion by a posterior surgical approach.[5‑7] Because of the 
wide variety of therapeutic options, it is important to 
understand the burden of current surgical procedures on the 
health‑care system in terms of perioperative complications.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the adverse events 
associated with cervical decompression and fusion in patients 
with cervical radiculopathy treated with a posterior cervical 
fusion (PCF) and cages.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
A retrospective study was undertaken at 11 centers in the US. 
The study was deemed exempt from the Institutional Review 
Board (IRB) review under 45CFR46.101 by an independent central 
IRB (Ethical and Independent Review Services, Corte Madera, 
CA, Protocol Number 15146‑01). The central IRB approved that 
no informed consent was necessary due to the nature of the 
study being a retrospective chart review with minimal risk to 
patient safety. A medical chart review was performed to review 
consecutive patients with cervical spine surgery. The chart’s 
data were collected by trained personnel at each center and 
case forms were reviewed by each investigator. All reviewed 
charts contained information about clinical complaints as well 
as pain assessment for the arm and neck through visual analog 
scale (VAS) for pain.[8] Neck and arm pain associated with 
cervical radiculopathy were assessed before surgery and on 
the subsequent control visits at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 6 months, 
12 months, and 24 months. The VAS is an 11‑point scale from 0 
to 10, where 0 represents the absence of pain and 10 represents 
the worst pain imaginable by the patient.[8]
All patients were treated surgically with PCF at one cervical 
level with cages (CAVUX Cervical Cage™ and DTRAX Spinal 
System®, Providence Medical Technology, Inc., Walnut Creek, 
CA, USA). There were 89 patients split into three cohorts. 
Group 1 was comprised of 46 patients who had PCF as a 
primary standalone treatment, Group 2 was comprised of 
15 patients who underwent circumferential surgery (anterior 
cervical discectomy and fusion [ACDF] + PCF), and Group 3 
was comprised of 28 pseudarthrosis patients with a history 
of ACDF who were treated with PCF [Figure 1].
The makeup of the 89 patients overall included 42 males 
and 47 females. Average age at the time of the surgery was 
58.0 ± 12.0 years (standalone 59.8 ± 12.4; circumferential 
64.3 ± 9.9, and pseudarthrosis 51.7 ± 9.6). Diagnoses included 
degenerative disc disease (n = 32), cervical spondylosis with 
radiculopathy (n = 56), disc herniation with radiculopathy 
(n = 7), and pseudarthrosis (n = 28) [Figure 2]. Surgeries were 
performed at levels C3‑T1 with the most common treated level 
being C5‑C6 level – 41.6% of all [Figure 3]. Out of 89 patients, 
41 of them were free of comorbidities – 46.1% [Figure 4].
Perioperative complications were divided into three main 
groups – neurological, vascular, and other. Perioperative

period was defined as 30 days after surgery.[9] Neurological 
complications were further subdivided as follows: dural 
tear, spinal cord, and peripheral nerve injury (postoperative 
radiculopathy).[10] Vascular complications were divided into 
excessive bleeding and arterial/venous injury.[10,11] The other 
complication group included epidural hematoma, dysphagia, 
dysphonia, wound infection, airway compromise, bone 
graft extrusion, and instrumentation failures.[10] Follow‑up

evaluation included clinical status and pain scale (VAS) The 
study protocol was approved by the scientific and ethical 
committees with which the authors are affiliated.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using the Statistica software 
(StatSoft, I. N. C.). Normal distribution of data was assessed 
by use of the Shapiro–Wilk test. The Wilcoxon test was used 
to test the differences for the data. The P level of 0.05 was 
considered significant. A power of the Wilcoxon test was 
set at 0.95. Mean values, standard deviations, minimal and 
maximal values for VAS, and the difference between the VAS 
score at the baseline and the VAS score at subsequent visits 
were calculated.
Surgical technique
The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with 
the patient prone. The shoulders were strapped down with 
tape, and biplanar fluoroscopy was used to visualize the 
cervical spine. A Stainamnn pin was placed externally and 
lateral to the patient’s neck and lined up with the intended 
facet using lateral fluoroscopy to establish a cranial‑caudal 
incision site and trajectory to the intended spinal level. The 
muscle and fascia reflected laterally off the spinous process. 
The instruments used for PCF were previously described 
by McCormack and Dhawan.[12] The facet access tool was 
advanced through the incision in a slight medial‑to‑lateral 
trajectory into the intended facet joint. Blunt dissection 
was performed to expose the intended facet and adjacent 
lateral mass, which could be directly visualized. Lateral 
mass and medial lamina adjacent to the posterior facet were 
decorticated with a trephine decorticator. A guide tube was 
then placed to maintain facet distraction and serve as a 
working channel. Facet endplates were decorticated with 
rasps, and the implant was deployed and anchored into the 
facet with a bone screw.[3,13] Local autograft bone was mixed 
with allograft in all cases. Bone was placed over the lateral 
mass decortication bed.
RESULTS
A total of 175 cervical cages were placed posteriorly in this 
study. The mean follow‑up interval was 7 months (range: 
2 weeks– 2 years) in all groups. All implants of the cervical 
cages were technically successful except for one surgery 
that had reported inability to implant a right‑sided cage 
due to a fused facet at the C4‑C5 level. There were no 
instrumentation malfunctions or aborted procedures. 
A summary of complications perioperative is reported 
in Table 1. There was one patient with neurological 
complications in the perioperative period. One patient in 
the pseudarthrosis group experienced spinal cord irritation 
from anterior approach. Symptoms resolved 6 months after 
surgery upon revision of the ACDF. None of the patients 
had vertebral artery injury or other vascular complications. 
There were no patients with cerebrospinal fluid leakage, 
wound infection, implant back‑out, or reoperations during 
the perioperative period. The other complications reported 
in this study included two patients with complications in 
the standalone group of which one was a case of atrial 
fibrillation in the postanesthetic care unit and one was a

patient with a parietal stroke during procedure or recovery. 
The average (median) hospital stay for all three groups was 
29 h (standalone 29.2 ± 22.2 h; circumferential 49.1 ± 33.7 h, 
and pseudarthrosis 29.3 ± 13.6 h).
Beyond the perioperative period, one patient in the 
standalone group had a C5 palsy deficit observed with 
symptoms 6 months after the PCF procedure at C4/C5, and 
one patient with pseudarthrosis was treated 12 months 
postoperatively for adjacent segment disease and a failed 
PCF
. One patient in the circumferential treatment group died 
3 months’ postsurgery due to a pulmonary embolism. Other 
problems that did not have clear diagnosis during follow‑up 
included diagnosis of carpal and cubital tunnel syndrome and 
degenerative disease of the shoulder.
Eighty‑one patients complained on the neck pain before the 
surgery and identified pain on the VAS scale, 79 patients 
complained on the arm pain, and 68 complained on both 
neck and arm pain. The number of patients on the subsequent 
visits was different [Tables 2 and 3] in comparison to the 
number of patients undertaken surgery. The mean values, 
standard deviations, minimal and maximal values for VAS 
and for the deference between VAS on the baseline, and the 
VAS reporting on the subsequent visit were presented in 
Tables 2 and 3. The Wilcoxon test (with P = 0.05) revealed 
the significant difference between the VAS reported before 
surgery in comparison to the VAS reported on the control 
visit in 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months 
after surgery [Tables 4 and 5]. Twenty‑four months after 
surgery, three patients’ complaint on neck pain identified 
on the VAS scale at 3, 6, and 7 points. One of these patients 
did not feel improvement (VAS 7). Two of these patients 
noticed the improvement in terms of neck pain: 10 points 
at the beginning and 3 points at the follow‑up end point, 
and 9 points at the beginning and 6 points at the follow‑up 
end point. Twenty‑four months after surgery, three patients’ 
complaint on the arm pain identified on the VAS scale at 4, 5, 
and 6 points. One of these patients had 1‑point improvement 
in VAS scale (6 points before surgery). Two patients had 
arm pain worsening: 3 and 4 points on the beginning and 
accordingly 4 and 6 points after 24 months.
DISCUSSION
In this retrospective multicenter study, we analyzed the 
perioperative clinical outcomes and complications associated 
with PCF with cage placement in 89 consecutive patients 
with cervical radiculopathy. The perioperative period, 
according to Campbell et al., was defined as 30 days after 
the index surgery.[8] The mean 7‑month follow‑up interval 
was sufficient to perform the perioperative complications 
analysis. The overall postsurgery complication rate was 
found to be 4.3% (standalone 6.5%, circumferential 0.0%, 
and pseudarthrosis 3.4%) [Table 1]. After accounting for 
relatedness to the PCF aspects of the treatment, the overall 
complication rate was 3.4%.
Cervical spondylotic radiculopathy is commonly treated 
through the anterior approach to the cervical spine.[14] 
Although this is widely considered to be a safe approach, 
the overall complication profile for ACDF/arthroplasty was 
reported to be 12.33% (range: 2.38%–32%).[15‑27] The majority of 
complications associated with anterior surgery are minor and 
self‑limiting.[27,28] Comparing the results from the current study

with data for other cervical procedures such as ACDF [Table 6] 
and posterior lateral mass screw (LMS) systems [Table 7] 
demonstrates that the use of PCF with cages in the treatment 
of spondylotic radiculopathy is not associated with an increase 
in perioperative complications of any kind. When comparing 
the general rate of all complications associated with PCF 
with bilateral cages placed between the facet joints, those 
reported in the literature for ACDF and PCF with cages have 
a more favorable complication profile (3.4% vs. 17.41%).[15‑26] 
Similarly, PCF with cages in all groups in this study had a 
favorable complication profile compared to that reported 
for posterior LMS systems (standalone 3.4% vs. 19.4%).[29‑41] 
It should be noted that the majority of lateral mass cases 
reported in the literature are multilevel and are performed 
for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. Furthermore, LMS 
placement requires an open posterior approach, and the 
procedure is usually performed in combination with a 
laminectomy. This prolongs surgical time, increases blood 
loss, and length of stay [Figures 4 and 5].
As with any technique involving instrumentation, there are 
a number of reasons why complications may occur. As with 
any new technique, there is an initial learning curve. For 
procedures that use a tissue‑sparing approach, the learning 
curve can be significantly steeper than for traditional 
techniques.[25] In our study, all cases were successfully 
completed using a tissue‑sparing approach. All complications 
that were captured in this study were minor with full recovery. 
Compared to other cervical techniques, the perioperative 
complication profile of PCF with cages looks promising. 
Meta‑analysis of cervical procedures reported a rate of 
4.81% of neurological complications with range of 0%–32% 
for ACDF technique and 9.89% with range of 0%–20.3% for 
posterior LMS (standalone 2.2%, circumferential 0.0%, and 
pseudarthrosis 3.6%).[15‑26,29‑41] Modern LMS placement has 
not been shown to be associated with vascular complications 
while ACDF technique reports 0.33%–10% patients out 
of 2990 cases (standalone 0%, circumferential 0%, and 
pseudarthrosis 0%).[15‑26,29‑41] Sekhon suggested that a 14‑mm 
screw is safe and effective based on the fact that the average 
vertical distance between the posterior midpoint of the 
lateral mass and the vertebral foramen from C3 to C6 is 
approximately 9–12 mm.[33] A cervical cage can be placed by 
a posterior approach in between a facet joint and is stopped 
from advancing ventrally toward the foramen transversarium 
by the cervical pedicle making vertebral artery injury highly 
unlikely. Other complications were reported to be 7.19%; 
1.8%–32% for ACDF and 9.51%; 0%–17.2% for posterior LMS 
systems.[15‑26,29‑41]
Serious adverse events associated with ACDF are rare 
but may include esophageal, tracheal, and carotid sheath 
injury. More commonly, patients experience postoperative 
dysphagia and subclinical vocal cord dysfunction.[10,42] In 
this study, one patient was reported with C5 palsy resulting 
in a 1.1% rate of occurrence, which is lower than anterior 
and posterior techniques which have been followed by

3%–6% C5 palsy.[43] It is important to note that no neurologic 
complications occurred in the standalone group or in the 
series of 52 patients who underwent PCF with cage placement 
published by Siemionow et al.[13]
Blood loss was negligible during this study of PCF with 
cages. Length of stay reported at 29 h for single‑level 
cases is favorable to ACDF and increases along with the 
complexity of the procedure as shown when comparing the 
standalone and pseudarthrosis groups to the circumferential 
group (standalone 29.2 ± 22.2 h, pseudarthrosis 29.3 ± 13.6 
h, and circumferential 49.1 ± 33.7 h). This finding is similar 
to that for ACDF procedures.
The performed surgery significantly improved 
patients’ outcomes regarding to neck and arm pain 
[Tables 3 and 4]. All subsequent collected data revealed the 
significant improvement achieved 2 weeks after surgery. 
The data have limitation based on the patients’ control visits 
frequency. On the last visit (24 months after surgery), only 
three patients appeared. It could impact into the results. 
Assuming that mainly patients with discomfort appear, we 
can expect better results than obtained.
Overall, PCF with cages for the treatment of cervical 
radiculopathy and ACDF‑associated pseudarthrosis is a safe 
and effective option with favorable complication and utility 
profiles.

PCF ‑ Posterior cervical fusion; LMS ‑ Lateral mass screw
 Siemionow, et al.: PCF with cages: Perioperative complications

Journal of Craniovertebral Junction and Spine / Volume 8 / Issue 4 / October-December 2017
Posterior cage fixation can achieve indirect cervical root 
decompression with less soft‑tissue disruption than LMF
.[5] 
The concept of indirect neuroforaminal decompression in 
this spine level has been validated for cervical spondylotic 
radiculopathy.[44‑46] Indirect cervical nerve root decompression 
and fusion performed using cervical cages placed bilaterally 
between the facet joints by way of a posterior approach 
has demonstrated good clinical and radiological outcomes 
at 24 months.[5,7,13] Stabilization achieved after bilateral 
posterior cervical cage implantation is reported to be similar 
to one‑level ACDF and LMF in biomechanical studies.[47,48] 
High fusion rate in mentioned method provides long‑term 
spine stabilization.[5]
CONCLUSION
The results of our study show that the PCF with cages can 
be considered a safe alternative for patients undergoing 
cervical spine surgery. The procedure has a favorable overall 
complication profile, short length of stay, a negligible blood 
loss, and significantly the neck and arm pain.
