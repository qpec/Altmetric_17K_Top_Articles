Increasing brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis in mice and humans improves
metabolic health and understanding BAT function is of interest for novel approaches to
counteract obesity. The role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in these processes remains
elusive. We observed maternally expressed, imprinted lncRNA H19 increased upon cold-
activation and decreased in obesity in BAT. Inverse correlations of H19 with BMI were
also observed in humans. H19 overexpression promoted, while silencing of H19 impaired
adipogenesis, oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial respiration in brown but not white
adipocytes. In vivo, H19 overexpression protected against DIO, improved insulin sensitivity
and mitochondrial biogenesis, whereas fat H19 loss sensitized towards HFD weight gains.
Strikingly, paternally expressed genes (PEG) were largely absent from BAT and we
demonstrated that H19 recruits PEG-inactivating H19-MBD1 complexes and acts as
BAT-selective PEG gatekeeper. This has implications for our understanding how monoallelic
gene expression affects metabolism in rodents and, potentially, humans.

besity results from chronic imbalances between caloric
intake and energy expenditure (EE), which finally cul-
minates in development of cardiometabolic complica-
tions1,
artherosclerosis,2
liver
manifestations
of
metabolic
disease3, and type 2 diabetes (T2D)1. In contrast to white adipose
tissue (WAT), which primarily stores lipids, brown adipose tissue
(BAT) represents a specialized organ that supports energy cata-
bolism by converting dietary and stored nutrients like lipids and
glucose into heat (non-shivering thermogenesis) by virtue of
uncoupling the electrochemical energies stored in proton gra-
dients across mitochondrial membranes4. The (re)-discovery of
functional BAT in (adult) humans5, the observation that surgical
and genetic ablation of BAT sensitizes towards obesity in mice6
and the clinically relevant fact that reductions in ambient tem-
peratures improve metabolism in lean7 and diabetic8 subjects,
spurred great interest in harnessing the catabolic properties of
BAT for therapeutic purposes. In recent years, significant pro-
gress was made in understanding and functionally dissecting the
transcriptional and epigenetic control of BAT differentiation and
function by protein-coding genes9. Yet, large-scale sequencing
initiatives such as ENCODE10 demonstrated that RNA tran-
scription is not confined to protein-coding genes but constitutes
a pervasive phenomenon observed throughout the majority of
genomes in higher organisms11, giving rise to thousands of small
noncoding RNAs like microRNAs but also long noncoding RNAs
(lncRNAs). LncRNAs are (arbitrarily) defined as transcripts ≥200
nt with low species conservation at the nucleotide level, low
coding potentials, and simplistic gene architectures12. Although
lncRNA numbers are debated, RNA-Seq meta-analyses in human
tissues identified >60,000 lncRNAs, which surpassed the ca.
22,000 coding genes detected in the same study13.
Despite progress in identifying and functionally dissecting
lncRNAs involved in cellular and organismal ageing14, metabolic
homeostasis15, and adipose tissue biology16,17, our understanding
of how lncRNA control adipogenesis and BAT differentiation and
function in particular remains elusive. To gain molecular insights
into these processes, we here performed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-
Seq) in BAT of mice exposed cold or exposed to chronic high-fat
diet
feeding
and
observed
that
monoallelically
expressed
(imprinted) lncRNA H19 correlated with BAT activation in
mouse, but also humans. In vitro and in vivo gene manipulation
identified BAT-selective roles for H19 in controlling adipocyte
differentiation and function and systemic energy metabolism.
Crucially, we found that many adipose-selective imprinted genes
expressed from paternal alleles were absent from BAT and could
demonstrate that H19 forms H19-MBD1 chromatin modifier
complexes that specifically repress paternally expressed imprinted
genes in brown, not white, adipocytes, thereby serving as selective
PEG gatekeeper in BAT.
Results
RNA-sequencing for BAT-regulatory lncRNAs. To identify
mRNAs and lncRNAs correlating with BAT function, we exposed
lean C57BL/6 mice to thermal stress (4 °C for 24 h) compared to
22 °C housed mice or to chronic high-fat-diet (HFD) compared to
micronutrient-matched control diet (CD) feeding. Next, we per-
formed RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) in these BAT samples and
observed 1394/433 upregulated and 1147/429 downregulated
mRNAs together with 71/6 upregulated and 101/33 down-
regulated lncRNAs across cold/DIO conditions (fold-change ≥2
or ≤−2; Fig. 1a-d, Supplementary Data 1,2). Alterations in BAT
thermogenesis
were
confirmed
by
elevated
and
decreased
Uncoupling Protein 1 (Ucp1) and ELOVL Fatty Acid Elongase 3
(Elovl3) mRNA expression during cold or diet-induced obesity
(DIO), respectively (Fig. 1e, f). Due to its BAT-selective
expression—as for Ucp1 and Elovl3 (Fig. 1e–g)—and strong
eutherian sequence conservation, we focussed on the intergenic
lncRNA (lincRNA) H19, which was induced in cold-exposed and
decreased in obese BAT (Fig. 1g). Notably, H19 expression was
not altered accordingly in subcutaneous (scWAT) or visceral
(vWAT) white adipose depots in contrast to browning/beiging
markers like Ucp1 (Fig. 1h-j), arguing for a selective involvement
of H19 in brown but not beige adipocyte differentiation and
function.
H19 controls brown adipogenesis and BAT oxidative meta-
bolism. When performing locked nucleic acid (LNA)-mediated
RNA interference (RNAi) in stromal-vascular fraction (SVF)
adipocyte precursor cells isolated from three major adipose
depots (BAT, scWAT, and vWAT), we observed blunted lipid
accumulation, reduced Oil Red O (ORO) lipid staining, and
impaired expression of BAT markers like Cell Death-Inducing
DFFA-Like Effector A (Cidea), Iodothyronine Deiodinase 2 (Dio2),
and Ucp1, as well as reduced UCP1 and PPARG Coactivator 1
Alpha (PGC1A) protein levels, together with common adipose
tissue markers like Adiponectin (Adipoq), CCAAT/Enhancer
Binding Protein Alpha (Cebpa), Fatty Acid Binding Protein 4
(Fabp4), and Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor Gamma
(Pparg) upon H19 RNAi in primary adipocyte precursor cells. We
thus concluded that H19 is required for the commitment of BAT
but not scWAT or vWAT-derived progenitors (Fig. 2a–c).
Next, we aimed to dissect the cell-intrinsic and metaboregu-
latory properties of H19 using in vitro gain/loss-of-function
approaches.
Cellular
bioenergetics
analyses
using
Seahorse
technology confirmed and calculation of coupling efficiencies
further supported that H19 RNAi impaired (Fig. 2d, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1a, c), whilst H19 overexpression supported oxidative
metabolism, uncoupling and extracellular acidification rates
(ECAR) in differentiated brown adipocytes (Supplementary
Fig. 1b, d, f) and sensitized brown adipocytes to stimulation
with beta3-adrenoreceptor agonist CL316,243 (Supplementary
Fig. 1e). This illustrates that H19 supports adipocyte differentia-
tion but also thermogenic gene expression, oxidative metabolism
and mitochondrial dynamics in mature adipocytes in a BAT-
specific manner. Interestingly, glycolysis was unaltered in H19
overexpressing adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1g), pinpointing
towards selective roles of H19 in mitochondrial lipid oxidation
not carbohydrate metabolism.
H19 was reported to reside in nuclear, but also cytoplasmic
and ribosomal fractions in other cell types11,18. As LNA-mediated
RNAi acts via RNAse H-mediated transcript decay predomi-
nantly in nuclei, we next targeted H19 using small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs), which act preferentially in the cytoplasm. We
observed H19 loss across subcellular compartments using both
techniques (Supplementary Fig. 1h, i). Doing so, we confirmed
critical roles for H19 in commitment of brown and subcuta-
neous19 adipocytes as demonstrated by decreased ORO staining
(Fig. 2f–h) and reduced expression of brown and white
adipogenesis markers including Pgc1a (Fig. 2i). Expression of
adipocyte precursor genes like Delta Like Non-Canonical Notch
Ligand 1 (Dlk1), Runt Related Transcription Factor 2 (Runx2),
Platelet Derived Growth Factor Receptor Alpha (Pdgfra), GATA
Binding Protein 2 (Gata2), Lymphocyte Antigen 6 Family
Member E (Ly6a), and Transforming Growth Factor Beta 2
(Tgfb2) remained high in BAT, but not scWAT or vWAT-derived
mature adipocytes upon LNA/siRNA-mediated H19 silencing
(Supplementary Fig. 2a, b). Independent H19 LNA and siRNA
inhibitors evoked similar arrests in brown adipocyte differentia-
tion and impaired expression of BAT markers (Supplementary
Fig. 2c, d).

 H19 was historically discovered as monoallelically expressed
gene in which solely maternal alleles express H19 in an epigenetic
process termed genomic imprinting. Here, the reciprocally
expressed H19-Igf2 imprinted gene cluster critically depends on
the enhancer-blocking properties of CCCTC-Binding Factor (Ctcf)
proteins20,21. As no defects in BAT adipogenesis occurred after
Ctcf RNAi (Supplementary Fig. 2e) and because BAT Ctcf and
Igf2 levels were not affected by DIO or cold (Supplementary
Fig. 2f, g), we reasoned that cold/DIO-evoked alterations in H19
are not secondary to altered H19-Igf2 imprinting, corroborating
earlier reports about reduced H19 expression independent from
traditional H19-Igf2 imprinting control22. Further, the H19-
encoded

 miR-675 in brown adipocyte differentiation as observed for
myogenic lineage determination23.
To gain insights into H19 function from global expression
analysis, we performed RNA-Seq in differentiating siRNA-treated
brown adipocytes, and identified 1410 differentially expressed
genes (p < 0.05, DESeq2), comprising 546 decreased and 999
enriched in siH19 versus siCtrl cells (Fig. 2j). Lower-expressed
genes were linked to brown adipocyte and mitochondrial
biogenesis and function, which failed to be expressed upon H19
silencing (Fig. 2j, k top) and Supplementary Data 3), whereas
higher-expressed genes were enriched for general functions in
signaling, locomotion, and morphogenesis, processes normally
suppressed during adipogenesis24–26 (Fig. 2j, k bottom and
Supplementary Data 3). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)27
indicated
significant
enrichment
of
gene
sets
for
brown
adipogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos), and mito-
chondrial
biogenesis
specifically
in
cells
with
intact
H19
expression (siCtrl; Fig. 2l). Suppression of the brown adipogenesis
program upon H19 knockdown could be due to suppression of
genes important for adipogenesis in general. To test this, we
investigated the consequences of H19 RNAi on expression of
previously defined groups of BAT-specific, WAT-specific, and
common adipogenic genes in differentiated BAT precursor
cells25. We found that, in general, loss of H19 repressed BAT-
selective as well as those common adipogenic genes normally
activated during adipogenesis (Fig. 2m), which is also reflected by
reduced ORO staining (Fig. 2f). In contrast, WAT-selective genes
are
modestly
affected
by
H19
knockdown
(Fig.
2m,
n).
Collectively, H19 mediates the concurrent activation of common
adipogenic genes as well as a core BAT gene program, whilst
curbing the expression of WAT genes.
H19 increases BAT EE and prevents obesity. Defects in brown
fat differentiation and function as well as concomitant impair-
ments in EE render mice susceptible to DIO-induced weight gains
and the development of metabolic disease28–30. Based on our
in vitro findings, we next addressed the role of H19 in regulating
energy metabolism and EE by exposing H19 gain-of-function31
and Controls to HFD or CD. H19 expression was ubiquitously
induced in H19 TG mice without changes in Igf2 and Ctcf
expression or body length alterations (Supplementary Fig. 3a–d).
H19 overexpression strongly prevented DIO-mediated weight
gains (Fig. 3a) and improved insulin sensitivity (Fig. 3b) although,
interestingly, glucose tolerance was decreased in H19 TG mice
(Fig. 3c). The beneficial effect of H19 overexpression in DIO
coincided with increased EE (Fig. 3d), trends towards increased
lipid mobilization at 22 °C (Fig. 3e) and oxygen consumption
(Supplementary Fig. 3e) at 22 °C, 4 °C and after additional nor-
ephinephrine (NE) administration at 4 °C, pinpointing towards
improved BAT function in H19 TG mice. This rise in energy
catabolism tended towards prevention of DIO-evoked increases
in scWAT and vWAT adiposity (Fig. 3f) and precluded DIO-
associated elevations in serum cholesterole (Fig. 3g) but not
triglycerides (Fig. 3h). H19 overexpression prevented whitening
of BAT (Fig. 3i, j), reduced vWAT but not scWAT hypertrophy
(Fig. 3k–m) and development of steatosis (Fig. 3n) in obese
animals. The H19-dependent induction of EE in obese mice co-
occurred with increased expression of browning markers in
scWAT at 4 °C, with little alterations in BAT thermogenesis at
this temperature (Fig. 3o, p) as reported by others29. As H19
overexpression in lean mice elicited little changes in body weight,
insulin sensitivity, RER, glucose clearance, EE and did not affect
relative adipose tissue weights and expression of BAT activation
markers in lean H19 TG mice (Supplementary Fig. 3f–k), our
data suggests that counteracting the HFD-induced H19 decline is
beneficial during DIO, but does not cause detrimental effects in
lean mice.
H19 loss in fat impairs EE and sensitizes towards obesity. As
H19 TG mice ubiquitously overexpress H19, we next ablated H19
specifically in BAT by crossing female mice harboring loxP-
flanked H19 methylation-sensitive imprinting control regions
(ICRs) with male Adipoq-cre expressing animals (H19ΔAT,
Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). H19ΔAT knockout mice gained
more body weight compared to Controls upon HFD (Fig. 4b) but
not CD (Supplementary Fig. 4c) feeding with negligible altera-
tions in insulin sensitivity or glucose tolerance (Fig. 4c, d and
Supplementary Fig. 4d, e). Crucially, BAT-specific H19 loss
decreased EE and oxygen consumption in both diets (Fig. 4e, f
and Supplementary Fig. 4f, g), tended towards decreased lipid
oxidation at 4 °C and increased scWAT adiposity in obese
(Fig. 4g, h), yet not lean (Supplementary Fig. 4h, i) mutant mice,
suggesting decreased BAT function in H19ΔAT mice, particularly
during DIO. As primary brown adipocytes isolated from H19ΔAT
mice exhibited defects in mature brown adipocyte function
(Supplementary Fig. 4j, k) as partly also observed during H19
RNAi (Supplementary Fig. 4p), we reasoned that impairments in
terminal brown function contribute to the observed defects in EE
and susceptibilities towards DIO in H19ΔAT mice.
Fat hH19 is reduced in obese humans. As H19 is strongly
conserved32 and human H19 (hH19) is expressed in mature
adipocytes compared to non-parenchymal cells in fat (Supple-
mentary Data 4), we next asked if hH19 could be affected by
obesity also in humans and quantified hH19 levels in scWAT and
vWAT biopsies from 169 lean and obese patients. We observed
that hH19 expression declined with ascending BMIs in both
depots and correlated positively with markers of adipose beiging
like UCP1 mRNA levels (Supplementary data 5), underscoring
that hH19 could support energy dissipation and acquisition of
catabolic expression profiles in human fat.
H19 regulates brown adipose mitochondrial biogenesis. Cold
temperature activation of BAT thermogenesis and the concurrent
turnover of nutrients, such as carbohydrates and lipids requires

 mitochondrial meshworks via fission and fusion33,34. Based on
the cell-intrinsic alterations in oxidative metabolism observed in
H19-deficient and overexpressing adipocytes (Fig. 2d, e, Supple-
mentary Fig. 1a, b) we studied mitochondrial morphologies using
electron microscopy. Although gross parameters like mitochon-
drial area or perimeter (Fig. 4i, j) were unchanged, we observed
substantial
defects
in
mitochondrial
architecture
such
as
perturbed cristae formation in obese Control but not H19 TG
mice (Fig. 4k), while H19ΔAT mitochondria showed impaired
cristae upon HFD feeding (Supplementary Fig. 4q). The expres-
sion of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis was blunted in
obese BAT, whilst H19 overexpression reversed these DIO-
evoked defects in gene expression in BAT, but not scWAT
(Fig. 4l, m). H19ΔAT mice displayed less pronounced reductions

 of the same gene set in BAT (Fig. 4n) yet not scWAT (Fig. 4o). In
contrast, fission and fusion parameters were unaltered in BAT
and scWAT (Supplementary Fig. 4l–o). Interestingly, cell-
intrinsic defects in mitochondriogenesis occurred also in H19-
deficient brown adipocytes (Supplementary Fig. 4p), closely
mimicking those elicited by DIO or H19 loss in adipose tissue
itself. Collectively, we here show that H19 loss in adipose tissue
renders mice susceptible to DIO weight gains and impairments of
EE, potentially due to the control of mitochondrial dynamics by
the lincRNA H19.
BAT represents a unique case of tissue-specific imprinting. The
lincRNA H19 represents a quintessential representative of a
class of imprinted genes exclusively transcribed from one
parental allele20,35. Although monoallelic expression is only
observed in <1% of all genes in eutherians36, loss-of-function
(epi)-mutations in individual imprints or imprinted gene clusters
cause severe imprinting disorders (ID) like Prader–Willi’s,
Beckwith–Wiedemann’s,
and
Angelman’s
syndromes37,
in
Silver–Russell’s syndrome even due to defects in the H19-Igf2
locus38.
Despite
progress
in
understanding
the
molecular
underpinnings of imprinting, the etiology of IDs21,39,40 and even
recent approaches to correct IDs41, the question remains why
certain genes but not others are monoallelically expressed per se42
and why certain genes are expressed from one parental gender,
not the other. Thus, to date it remains unsolved whether func-
tional or conceptual similarities between paternally expressed
(PEGs) or maternally expressed genes (MEGs) as two discordant
gene sets exist at all, largely because PEGs/MEGs represent a
collection of genes with heterogeneous functions. Interestingly,
one hallmark of ID patients and ID mouse models are metabolic
problems, for instance altered adiposity and lipodystrophy and
alterations in insulin sensitivity and EE43, all processes closely
linked to brown and WAT (dys)-function. Given the BAT-
selectivity of H19 and its novel role in brown adipocyte differ-
entiation and function, we were interested how other PEGs/
MEGs are expressed across fat depots transcriptome-wide. While
RNA-Seq from C57BL/6 mice revealed no gross differences in
MEGs abundances between BAT, scWAT, or vWAT, seven fat-
abundant protein-coding (G Protein Coupled Receptor 1 (Gpr1),
Insulin Like Growth factor 2 (Igf2), Mesoderm Specific Transcript
(Mest), Neuronatin (Nnat), Paternally Expressed 3 and 10 (Peg3,
Peg10), and Plag1 Like Zinc Finger 1 (Plagl1)) and three micro-
RNA PEGs (miR184, miR298, and miR-335, Fig. 5e) and many
others were absent from BAT yet robustly expressed in scWAT
and vWAT (Fig. 5a–e).
H19 curbs expression of PEG-enriched gene networks in BAT.
To shed molecular light on this unique pattern of fat tissue-
specific imprinting, we built upon recent reports demonstrating
that expression of imprinted genes can be interdependent, e.g.,
during muscle regeneration or in embryonic fibroblasts44–47 and
that PEG-enriched imprinted gene networks (IGNs) are affected
by H1948–50. We thus hypothesized that H19 represses PEG-IGNs
in brown fat and, indeed, H19 RNAi tended to derepress fat-
abundant PEGs like Igf2, Peg10, and Plagl1 but not MEGs like
Cyclin Dependent Kinsae Inhibitor 1C (Cdkn1c), Decorin (Dcn),
Igf2 Receptor (Igf2r), and Solute Carrier Family 22 Member 3
(Slc22a3) (Fig. 5f, g). As PEG expression declined brown adipo-
genesis (Fig. 5h), we next asked if H19 ablation affects PEG/
MEGs globally. As expected, H19 loss did not alter MEG
expression in differentiated primary (1°) BAT or 1°vWAT pre-
cursor
cells
(Supplementary
Fig.
5a,
b),
yet
counteracted
differentiation-induced PEG losses during brown, but not white
adipogenesis (Fig. 5i, j). Thus, H19 acts as PEG gatekeeper in
brown adipocytes, a finding not observed for BAT MEGs nor
white fat PEGs.
H19 represses BAT PEGs by recruiting MBD1 chromatin
modifier. As H19 expression was not altered in BAT, scWAT,
and vWAT commitment (Supplementary Fig. 5c) and because we
did not observe differences in DNA methylation of affected PEGs
ICRs (Supplementary Fig. 5d), we asked whether specific protein
interactors of H19 control its PEG gatekeeper function selectively
in brown adipocytes. We thus conducted Capture Hybridization
Analysis of RNA Targets51 coupled to mass spectrometry
(CHART-MS)
from
confluent
and
differentiated
primary
immortalized brown adipocytes (PIBA) and obtained a compre-
hensive H19 protein interactome from both conditions: In total
3590 proteins were detected by MS, 168 were enriched by H19
antisense, not sense oligonucleotide co-immunoprecipitation
(Supplementary Data 7). 76 and 54 proteins bound to H19 in
confluent and differentiated PIBA cells, respectively, and 38
proteins were bound by H19 in both (Fig. 5k). Next, we per-
formed Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to construct an inter-
connected H19 binding protein network comprising 61 proteins
(Fig. 5l). Crucially, when performing gene ontology (GO) ana-
lyses, we observed that whereas in immature (confluent) brown
adipocytes H19 mostly recruited proteins annotated as RNA-
binding proteins (RBPs, e.g., H19 interactors like Insulin Like
Growth Factor 2 Binding Protein 3 (IGFBP3))52, in differentiated
cells H19 preferentially associated with proteins classified as

 does not occur in white adipocytes where H19 abundances
are low.
We reasoned that PEG enrichment in subcutaneous and
visceral WAT pinpoints towards an underappreciated involve-
ment of PEGs in WAT-relevant processes like white adipogenesis
or lipid accrual, i.e.,processes that sensitize towards increased
adiposity and obesity. To address this, we quantified PEGs/
MEGs in DIO using RNA-Seq and, performing GSEA27, observed
trends towards decreased PEG levels in cold-exposed (Fig. 5n)
and elevated PEG expression in obese BAT (Fig. 5o). In an
elegant study, Koza et al. biopsied adipose tissue from C57BL6
mice before HFD feeding53. Profiling the pretreatment samples
from low and high BW gainers of the 107-animal cohort, the
authors reported gene signatures for DIO susceptibility. Reana-
lyzing this data set, we found clear evidence that PEG levels
foreshadow obesity susceptibility even before overnutrition
(Fig. 5p). Finally, H19 correlated negatively, whereas 5 of 10
fat-abundant PEGs (Gpr1, Mest, Nnat, Peg3, and Sgce) correlated
positively
with
DIO
susceptibility
across
a
panel
of
25
phenotypically
and
genetically
discordant
mouse
strains54
(Fig. 5p–r, Supplementary Fig. 5f). Taken together, we believe
that H19-MBD1 complexes repress PEG but not MEG expression
in brown adipocytes, supporting a notion according to which
individual PEGs47,55,56 but also paternal monoallelic gene
expression in general sensitizes towards fat accumulation and
diet-induced weight gains, a process at least partially repressed
by the lincRNA H19 in BAT.
Collectively, we here demonstrate that the conserved lincRNA
H19 is uniquely required for differentiation and mature fat cell
function of brown but not white adipocytes in vitro and that
brown adipose H19 ensures energy dissipation in vivo. One
mechanism of how H19 supports EE could be its cell-intrinsic
control of mitochondrial biogenesis in mature brown adipocytes
and the ensurance of
maintaining quiescence
of obesity-
predisposing PEGs in BAT.
Discussion
Our results collectively indicate that the conserved lincRNA H19
promotes brown adipocyte differentiation and function in vitro
and that H19 ensures energy dissipation in vivo. In addition, we
observed that H19-mediated alterations of IGN constitutes an
important regulatory layer of BAT development and function
according to which PEGs affect brown fat negatively (Dlk1, Peg1,
Ndn, paternally expressed GNAS isoform XLαs), whereas MEGs
(Gαs) affect BAT positively43. The kinship theory of the evolution
of imprinting predicts that PEGs should act to reduce energy-
costly thermogenic output57. Our data are broadly consistent with
this prediction as loss of H19 in brown adipocytes leads to
coordinated transcriptional upregulation of multiple paternally
imprinted
genes.
This
finding
is
distinct
from
canonical
imprinting regulation in that perturbed imprinting control should
lead to downregulation of some imprinted genes with a reciprocal
upregulation of others.
We obtained no evidence for changes in canonical imprinting
in our models, amongst others because DNA methylation of
affected PEGs ICRs and Igf2/Ctcf expression was unaltered by
H19 loss in brown adipocytes. Our data rather suggest that this
unique pattern of PEG regulation is maintained through H19/
Mbd1 complexes acting in trans. Although evidence supporting
this was collected from a single Mbd1 siRNA, MBD1 was already
shown to interact with H19 to regulate IGNs during embryo
growth50. Yet, future studies are needed to show if H19 PEG
gatekeeper function persists at thermoneutrality or other (e.g.,
surgical) models of altered BAT-evoked EEs.
Because of the role of PEGs in WAT-relevant processes
like white adipogenesis and adipocyte cell size regulation, it is
plausible to assume that H19 preserves BAT homeostasis
during DIO by its cell-intrinsic control of mitochondrial bio-
genesis in mature brown adipocytes and by maintaining quies-
cence of obesity-predisposing PEGs in BAT. In line with this
hypothesis are data showing brown adipocyte death as a con-
sequence of DIO induce whitening of BAT58, a process sup-
pressed by H19.
Collectively, our data suggest that H19 acts as PEG gatekeeper
in brown adipocytes, potentially acting via MBD1-dependent
alterations of H3K9me3 KMTs recruitment are in line with
previous reports demonstating that H19 regulates fine-tuned
regulation of embryonic growth mediated by the H19 gene.
Identification of the underlying molecular mechanisms through
which it controls its targets is an important issue.
Methods
Animal care and research diets. All animals were maintained on a C57BL/6
background, housed in groups of 3–5 animals per cage on a constant 12 h light/
dark cycle in a SPF-controlled facility with regular testing for pathogens. All
experimental mice were 17–18 weeks of age at sacrifice. Experimental mice were
exposed to HFD feeding for 15 weeks (H19 TG and H19ΔAT mice versus littermate
Controls) and 17–18 weeks of age at sacrifice. Care of animals was within insti-
tutional and animal-care committee guidelines approved by local (Bezirksregierung
Köln) or regional (Tierschutzkommission acc. §15 TSchG of the Landesamt for
Natur, Umwelt und Verbraucherschutz (LANUV) North-Rhine Westphalia, Ger-
many, internal accession no. 84–02.04–2014.A068) authorities. Unless otherwise
indicated, animals were allowed ad libitum access to control diet (CD, D12450B*

Mouse husbandry. Adipose tissue samples used for acquisition of a tissue RNA-
Seq profile were taken from male C57BL/6 mice (Charles River). At time of
sacrifice, the mice were 32 weeks of age and 28 weeks exposed to CD feeding.
C57BL/6 male mice used for CD versus HFD feeding came from Charles
River. Upon dissection, the mice were 32 weeks of age and 28 weeks exposed to
CD or HFD feeding. For cold exposures, 10–12 weeks old C57BL/6 male mice
were either constantly housed at 22 °C or exposed to 4 °C cold challenges for 20 h,
fasted for additional 4 h, and sacrificed thereafter. H19 overexpression was
achieved using a mouse strain harboring yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs,
present in ten genomic copies) with each YAC cassette containing a 130 kb
transgene spanning the entire H19-Igf2 cluster with a LacZ-inactivated Igf2
coding sequence (MGI accession number 5648556, Symbol: Tg(Igf2/LacZ,H19)

male, non-randomized mice were used, the investigator not blinded to
genotypes due to strong phenotypical differences (e.g., in body weight upon
HFD feeding) between H19 TG and Controls. Mice harboring loxP-flanked H19
differentially methylated regions (DMR; H19-DMRflDMR/flDMR) were
generated as described59 and obtained from Linheng Li (Stowers Institute).

 Female H19-DMRflDMR/flDMR were bred with male C57BL/6 expressing adipose-
selective Adiponectin (Adipoq)-promoter driven Cre (H19-DMRwt/wt; Adipoq-
Cretg/wt) to obtain H19-DMRflDMR/wt; Adipoq-Cretg/wt (H19ΔAT) and H19-
DMRflDMR/wt; and Adipoq-Crewt/wt control littermates (Control to H19ΔAT).
Only male, non-randomized mice were used with the experimentator not blinded
to the genotype.
Mouse RNA isolation. RNA from indicated tissues and primary adipocytes was
isolated using Trizol® according to manufacturer’s protocols for total RNA isola-
tion. For subcellular localization analyses, RNAs were purified from nuclear and
cytoplasmic fractions obtained using the PARIS kit (Ambion) according to man-
ufacturer’s protocol.
Deep RNA-sequencing procedure. (1) For 4 °C versus 22 °C and CD versus HFD
BAT samples: library preparation and sequencing was performed at the Max
Planck-Genome-centre Cologne, Germany. Following initial quality checks, 1 μg
total RNA of each sample was depleted for rRNA using NEBNext® rRNA depletion
Kit (human/mouse/rat). Library preparation was performed with NEBNext Ultra™
Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (New England Biolabs). All libraries
were sequenced in parallel on a HiSeq2500 instrument (Illumina) in 2 × 100 bp
sequencing mode. (2) For siH19 and siCtrl transfected 1° BAT and 1° vWAT
samples: library preparation and sequencing was carried out by the Core facility
Genomics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. Briefly, sequencing
libraries were prepared using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep Kit
according to manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced on Illumina NextSeq550
platforms. The resulting 75 bp single-end reads were quality-checked with FastQC
(http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/), and low quality reads
were removed using the fastq_quality_trimmer (“-t 20 -l 25” parameters) from the
FASTX-Toolkit.
Deep RNA-sequencing data processing. RNA-Seq data were processed using the
QuickNGS analysis pipeline60, version 1.2.7, based on Ensembl release 87. In brief,
reads were mapped to the GRCm38 assembly of the mouse genome using Tophat2,
version 2.0.10, and reassembled with Cufflinks, version 2.1.1. Differential gene
expression was analyzed using the DESeq2 package, version 1.10.1. The results
were uploaded to the QuickNGS database and combined with multiple annotations
using the biomaRt package. For 4 °C versus 22 °C and CD versus HFD BAT
samples, n = 2 per condition and for siH19 and siCtrl transfected 1° BAT and
1° vWAT samples, n = 3 per condition.
Gene set enrichment analysis. GSEA is a computational pathway analysis
tool that determines if a given set of manually curated genes show statistically
significant, concordant differences between two biological states (http://www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp). A list of murine imprinted genes from www.
geneimprint.com was used to construct gene sets representing all known PEGs
and MEGs, respectively. Genes were first ranked based on real value using the
weighted signal-to noise metric. p-values and false discovery rates (FDR) for the
enrichment score of each gene set were calculated based on 1000 gene set
permutations.
Cultivation of PIBA cell lines. PIBA cell lines were generated in-house (s. below)
and maintained in growth medium Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM,
PAA) containing 4.5 g/l glucose supplemented with 10% FCS, 5 mM L-glutamine,
0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 1× penicillin/
streptomycin (P/S). Cells were grown to confluency in differentiation medium
(DMEM, 20 nM insulin, 1 nM T3). Brown adipocyte differentiation was induced
using differentiation medium supplemented with 0.125 mM indomethacin, 2 mg/1
dexamethasone, and 0.5 mM isobutylmethylxanthine for 1 day and incubated in
differentiation medium for 5 more days.
Generation of stable PIBA cell lines. PIBA cells were prepared from C57BL/6
mice based on principles described in Klein et al.61 with slight
modifications. Interscapular BAT from postnatal day three newborn-mice were
resected and minced in 500 μl sterile PBS. Tissue pieces were subjected to col-
lagenase digestion by adding 500 μl digestion buffer (123 mM NaCl, 5 mM
KCl, 1.3 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, 100 mM HEPES, 1% P/S, 4% BSA)
containing 1.5 mg/mL Collagenase A (Roche), followed by repeated cycles of
vortexing for 10 s and incubation at 37 °C for 30 s every 5 min until a single
cell suspension was achieved. Cell suspensions were filtered through a 100 μm
screen and cells collected by centrifugation at 422.2× g for 5 min. The cells
were then resuspended in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM)
supplemented with 4.5 g/l glucose, 20% fetal calf serum (FCS), 20 mM HEPES,
sodium pyruvate, L-glutamine, non-essential amino acids and 1% P/S and
cultured at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Media was changed every day until cells
had reached 80% confluency and were passaged once. For immortalization
cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding the SV40 large T-antigen
using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection-reagent (Invitrogen) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. PIBA cells were tested mycoplasma negative before
experiments.
Isolation stromal-vascular fraction derived 1° adipocytes. To isolate
depot-specific SVF cells, male C57BL/6 mice were sacrificed by CO2 or cervical
dislocation. Next, interscapular BAT, posterior inguinal subcutanous (scWAT) and
perigonadal visceral (vWAT) tissue of 6–8 weeks old male of indicated
genotypes was removed and tissues transferred into serum-free DMEM/Ham’s
F-12 medium. To obtain sufficient cell numbers, BAT tissues were pooled
according to genotype if needed. In a sterile environment, tissue medium was
aspirated before cutting the adipose tissue into pieces until a homogenized
consistency was achieved. Homogenized tissue was collected in a 50 ml tube filled
with 10 ml serum-free DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium. To wash out cellular
debris, 5 ml of the lower phase without visible tissue chungs were aspirated, 5 ml
serum-free DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium added and in a final wash 5 ml of the
infranatant removed. For each scWAT and vWAT tube 1 mg/ml Collagenase II, 1.
5% BSA, 6.6 ml serum-free medium and 100 μl DNase (15 kU/ml) were
prepared. For each BAT tube the same substances as for scWAT and vWAT
plus 240 μl Dispase I (50 U/ml) were added. To each adipose tissue preparation,
10 ml of the mixed enzyme solution were added. Next the tubes were placed in a
37 °C water bath and shaken at 120 rpm/min for 15 min. The tubes were vigorously
shaken by hand before warming again at 37 °C for another 15 min at 120 rpm/min.
For purification, the cell suspension was filtered through 100 μm filters into a 50 ml
tube filled with 20 ml DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium. The suspension was
centrifuged for 5 min, 21 °C and 200× g, supernatants discarded and pellets
resuspended in 1 ml DMEM/Ham’s F-12 growth medium (DMEM/Ham’s F12
medium plus 10% Fetal Calf Serum, 1% P/S, 0.1% Biotin and 0.1%
pantothenic acid) and filled up to 10 ml. After centrifugation for 5 min, 21 °C
and 200× g, the medium was aspirated up to 1 ml, the pellet resuspended and
transferred into a 15 ml tube. The tube was filled up to 13 ml with growth
medium and centrifuged for 5 min, 21 °C and 200× g. Next, supernatants were

The tube was filled up to 13 ml and centrifuged for 5 min, 21 °C and 200× g. The
supernatant was aspirated up to 1 ml solution. In the remaining 1 ml, the pellet was
resuspended and the solution filtered using a 30-μm filter wetted with 500 μl
growth medium. After filtration, the filter was rinsed with 500 μl growth medium
and isolated cells counted using a Neubauer Counting Chamber to seed 50,000
cells/well in flat bottom 24-well-plates.
Induction of SVF adipogenesis. To induce commitment of SVFs into mature
adipocytes, freshly prepared 0.05% Insulin, 0.005% Dexmethasone, 0.001% Rosi-
glitazone, and 0.05% 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthin (IBMX, scWCAT and vWAT) or
0.1% Indomethazine, 0.001% Triiodothyronine (BAT) in growth medium
(induction medium) were added to confluent cells. After 48 h of induction, dif-
ferentiation was initiated using freshly prepared 0.001% Rosiglitazone (scWAT and
vWAT) or 0.001% Triiodothyronine (BAT) in growth medium (differentiation

 medium). Differentiation was achieved after 3–4 days of incubation in differ-
entiation medium.
LNA-mediated gene knockdown of primary adipocytes. Primary brown adi-
pocytes were derived from depots-specific SVFs as described above. Cells were
grown until confluency in growth medium. For H19 inhibition custom-made LNA
GapmeRs were transfected after cells reached confluency (GapmeR sequences are
provided in Supplementary Data 6). Lipofectamine 2000 was diluted 1:62.5 in Opti-
MEM. For a final concentration of 25 nM, respective LNAs (stock 10 μM) were
diluted 1:50 in Opti-MEM. Both solutions were incubated for 5 min at RT. LNA
and Lipofectamine solutions were mixed at equal volumes and incubated for
20 min at RT. The cells were washed with pre-warmed PBS and 750 μl of growth
medium without P/S added to each well. A volume of 250 μl of LNA/Lipofectamine
mix was added and cells incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before changing
medium to induction medium.
siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of primary adipocytes. SiRNAs targeting
H19 (siH19, oligo n253571) or non-targeting Control (siCtrl, Cat. No. 4390843;
both 100 nmol/l, Invitrogen) were delivered into 1° BAT or vWAT adipocytes by
Amaxa nucleofection (Lonza Bioscience) according to manufacturer’s recom-
mendations. The cells were utilized 48–72 h after transfection. SiRNA sequences
are provided in Supplementary Data 6.
Immunoblot analysis. For protein isolation, the medium of cells was aspirated and
the plates were stored on ice. The cell monolayer was washed gently one time with
ice-cold PBS. Excess PBS was aspirated. A volume of 50 μl of RIPA lysis buffer with
inhibitors was added to each well of the 24-well plate. RIPA buffer was composed
of 50 mM Tris-HCL pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCL 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deox-
ycholate, 1% NP-40, 1× protease inhibitor and 1× phosphatase inhibitor. An ice-
cold cell scraper was used to scrape the cells. The lysate was transferred to 1.5 ml
Eppendorf tubes. The samples were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and thawed on
ice for three repeated cycles. After 10 min of centrifugation at 12,000× g and 4 °C
the supernatant was transferred to fresh tubes and stored on −80 °C. Protein
concentration was determined using the bicinchonoinic acid method. Samples were
separated by SDS-PAGE after being mixed with 4× Laemmli Sample Buffer con-
taining 10% β-mercaptoethanol and heated to 95 °C for 5 min. Afterwards, proteins
were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane for incubation with primary anti-
bodies raised against PGC-1A (sc-13067, Santa Cruz 1:500), UCP1 (sc-6528, Santa
Cruz, 1:500). Calnexin (208–880, Calbiochem, 1:5000) served as loading control.
Uncropped scans of the blots can be found as a Supplementary Figure in
the Supplementary Information.
Oil Red O Staining. ORO solution was prepared by dissolving 0.3 g ORO dye in
60 ml isopropanol in the dark overnight at room temperature. Afterwards, 40 ml
dH2O was added and the solution filtered. In a fume hood the media of the cell
plates was aspirated and plates rinsed with 2 ml of sterile PBS per well. Next, PBS
was aspirated and 1 ml of 10% formalin added. Cells were incubated for 1.5 h at
room temperature, excess formalin removed, wells washed with 2 ml PBS and
stained with 1 ml ORO staining solution for 2 h. Before image acquisition, the wells
were washed twice with dH2O for 5 min.
Oxygen consumption rates and glycolytic activity. SVF from indicated adipose
tissue depots were seeded into Agilent Seahorse XFe96 Bioanalyzer microplates. Per
well 50,000 cells were seeded and incubated in DMEM/Ham’s F-12 medium plus
10 % Fetal Calf Serum, 1% P/S, 0.1% Biotin and 0.1% Pantothenic acid (Growth
medium) at 37 °C and 5% CO2 at a standard incubator until confluency is reached.
For H19 inhibition cells were transfected as described above directly in the Sea-
horse setup. For this, the cells were washed with pre-warmed PBS and 75 μl of
growth medium w/o P/S added to each well. A volume of 25 μl of LNA/Lipo-
fectamine mix was added and cells incubated for 24 h at 37 °C and 5% CO2 before
changing medium to induction medium. To induce commitment of SVFs into
mature adipocytes directly within the Seahorse microplates, freshly prepared 0.05%
Insulin, 0.005% Dexmethasone, 0.001% Rosiglitazone, and 0.05 % IBMX (scWCAT
and vWAT) or 0.1% Indomethazine, 0.001% Triiodothyronine (BAT) in growth
medium (induction medium) were added. After 48 h of induction, differentiation
was initiated using freshly prepared 0.001% Rosiglitazone (scWAT and vVAT) or
0.001% Triiodothyronine (BAT) in growth medium (differentiation medium).
Differentiation was achieved after 3–4 days of incubation in differentiation med-
ium. For each seahorse plate the corresponding calibration plate was prepared 24 h
prior to experiments using 200 μl XF Seahorse Calibrant Agilent per well. The plate
was incubated for 24 h in a non-CO2 incubator at 37 °C and the instrument set to
37 °C 24 h prior to the experiment. One hour before measuring the plate, it was
washed with PBS and the medium changed according to the corresponding
experiment analyte kits (MitoStressKit or GlycoStressKit, provided by the manu-
facturer). Prior to measurement, calibration was started using calibration plates,
measuring O2 and pH LED Value/emission/Initial reference Delta for each well.
After calibration cartridges were kept within the machine and measurement of
adipocyte-containing microplates commenced. Measurement parameters were:
Mix: 3 min, wait 0 min, measure 3 min with each reagent’s effect assessed within 3
(MitoStressKit) or 4 measurement cycles (GlycoStressKit) with a total duration of
18 or 24 min per reagent injection. All measurements started with measuring basal
values, followed by injection of Oligomycin, FCCP and Rotenone + Antimycin A
(MitoStressKit) or Glucose, Oligomycin and 2-Deoxy-Glucose, GlycoStressKit).
Coupling efficiencies were calculated as reported recently62.
For MitoStress Kits, corresponding media were prepared shortly before the
experiment and consisted of Basal Seahorse Medium supplemented with 25 mM
Glucose, 1 mM Glutamine, 2 mM Sodium Pyruvate, set to pH = 7.4 and filtered
sterile. Per Plate ca. 25 ml of MitoStress Medium were needed and Seahorse cell
plates were changed to 180 μl MitoStress medium 1 h prior to calibration in a non-
CO2 incubator at 37 °C. The calibration plate possessed a cartridge having 4
pockets per well. Before the measurement pocket A was filled with 20 μl 10 μM
Oligomycin, pocket B with 22 μl 10 μM FCCP and pocket C with 25 μl 5 μM
Antimycin A and Rotenone. For the GlycoStressKit, the cell plate was washed with
PBS and media changed to filtered 180 μl GlycoStress medium. GlycoStress
medium consisted of Basal Seahorse Medium supplemented with 1 mM Glutamine
and 2 mM Sodium Pyruvate, set to pH = 7.4 and stored for 1 h in a non-CO2
incubator at 37 °C. The calibration plate possessed a cartridge having 4 pockets per
well. Shortly before the measurement pocket A was filled with 20 μl 10 mM
Glucose, pocket B with 22 μl 10 μM Oligomycin and pocket C with 25 μl 50 mM
2-Deoxy-Glucose.
Glucose tolerance test & insulin tolerance test. At the time of performing
insulin tolerance test (ITTs), mice were 12 weeks of age and 9 weeks exposed to CD
or HFD feeding. The ITT was carried out in random-fed mice at 9–10 am in the
morning in fresh cages with bedding, free access to drinking water but no food.
After determining basal blood glucose levels (0 min), each animal received 0.75 U/
kg of body weight of insulin (Actrapid; Novo Nordisk). Blood glucose levels were
recorded after 15, 30 and 60 min in male H19ΔAT (CD, n = 5), Control (Control
for H19ΔAT, CD, n = 5), H19ΔAT (HFD, n = 4), Control (Control for H19ΔAT,

 10 weeks exposed to CD or HFD feeding. GTT was carried out at 12 am after a 6 h
fast starting in the morning. After determining basal blood glucose levels (0 min),
animals received an intraperitoneal bolus of 2 g glucose per kilogram of body
weight (20% glucose, Delta select). Blood glucose levels were determined 15, 30, 60,
and 120 min after injection using an automatic glucose monitor (Contour, Bayer
Diabetes Care) in male H19ΔAT (CD, n = 5), Control (Control for H19ΔAT, CD,
n = 5), H19ΔAT (HFD, n = 4), Control (Control for H19ΔAT, HFD, n = 5), H19 TG
(CD, n = 6), Control (Control for H19 TG, CD, n = 5), H19 TG (HFD, n = 5),
Control (Control for H19 TG, HFD, n = 5) mice. Animals were excluded from
analysis that showed no increase/decrease of blood glucose levels after i.p. injection
of glucose (GTT) or insulin (ITT), respectively, assuming injection outside of the
peritoneal cavity as required for the assay.
Indirect calorimetry (PhenoMaster). Upon indirect calorimetry measurements,
mice of all genotypes and diets were 16 weeks of age and 13 weeks exposed to CD
or HFD. Metabolic measurements were obtained using a PhenoMaster System
(TSE Systems). For this, five days before analysis, the mice were placed alone in
training cages, identical to the 7.1-l chambers of the PhenoMaster open circuit
calorimetry system and continued to receive respective diets (CD, HFD)
throughout training and data acquisition. Diets and water were provided ad libitum
in the appropriate devices and food intake measured by the built-in automated
instruments. Parameters of indirect calorimetry were measured initially for 96 h at
22 °C (warm measurement). Subsequently, temperatures within the PhenoMaster
setup were reduced to 4 °C (cold measurement) and data acquired for 96 h. At the
end, NE was administered at 4 °C intraperitoneally at a final concentration of 1 mg/
kg and measurements continued for another 24 h (NE measurement) to measure
maximally activated BAT uncoupling effects. Mean values for each time of day
were calculated and plotted for warm, cold and NE measurement in male H19ΔAT
(CD, n = 5), Control (Control for H19ΔAT, CD, n = 5), Male H19ΔAT (HFD,
n = 4), Control (Control for H19ΔAT, HFD, n = 5), H19 TG (CD, n = 5), Control
(Control for H19 TG, CD, n = 4), H19 TG (HFD, n = 4), Control (Control for H19
TG, HFD, n = 5) mice.
mRNA isolation and quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) analysis. Total RNA was
isolated from primary adipocytes and tissues using peqGOLD TriFast (PEQLAB
Biotechnologie). mRNA was reverse transcribed into complementary DNA using
EuroScript reverse transcriptase (Eurogentec). Abundances of mRNAs/lncRNAs
were quantified by TaqMan Assay on Demand Kits (Applied Biosystems)
according to the manufacturer’s protocol if not indicated otherwise. Abundances of

quantified using SYBR methodology using Select Master Mixes (Thermo Fisher).
The relative abundance of mRNAs was calculated using comparative methods
(2−δδCT) according to ABI Relative Quantification Methods. Transcript levels of
mRNAs were normalized to hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Hprt1)
expression; Hprt abundances were unaffected across all experimental conditions.
SYBR primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Data 6.
Immunohistochemistry. Resected BAT, scWAT, vWAT, and liver specimens were
incubated at 4 °C overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde, embedded in paraffin and
sliced according to standard protocols. Haematoxylin and eosin (HE) stainings
were carried out after deparaffination as described63.
Automated adipocyte quantification. HE stainings were prepared as described
above. An automated workflow was devised to segment and measure adipocytes
from the tissue images. First, the interactive learning and segmentation toolkit
ilastik (www.ilastik.com) was used to train tissue-specific pixel-level classifiers on
the RGB photomicrographs. For classification of BAT three classes were defined
(membrane, vacuole, nucleus) and a classifier using a set of eleven optimized
features selected by the filter method was trained based on a manually labeled
training data set. For images from scWAT and vWAT a unified classifier was
trained with just two classes (membrane and vacuole) and using all available fea-
tures. Application of the classifiers to the respective image sets resulted in two or
three class probability maps, which were fed in Cellprofiler to segment and indi-
vidually measure single adipocytes. The vacuole probability map was smoothed and
automatically thresholded. The obtained binary vacuole mask was subjected to
morphological closing to fill small holes. The result was used to mask the original
vacuole probability image, which then was used to perform intensity/probability
based cell segmentation by means of the Cellprofiler Identify Primary Objects
module. The cell masks were expanded until touching their neighboring cells and
cells intersecting with the image border before expansion were excluded. Size and
shape parameters of the remaining cells were measured.
Electron microscopy and mitochondrial morphometry. For the fixation of the
tissues the specimen were cut into small (~1 mm3) pieces and stored in fresh
fixative (10 ml Caco-buffer, 1.6 ml of 25 % Glutardialdehyd, 5 ml of 8% PFA in
H2O, filled up to 20 ml with DEPC-treated H2O with pH-value adjusted to 7.3) for
16–24 h at 4 °C. For embedding of the fat tissue samples were washed 4× for 20 min
in 0.1 M Caco-buffer (pH = 7.2–7.3) at 4 °C. The samples were stored for 2 h in 2%
OsO4 in 0.1 M Caco-buffer (pH = 7.2–7.3) at 4 °C in the dark. Afterwards, samples
were washed in 0.1 M Caco-buffer (pH = 7.2–7.3) 4× for 20 min at 4 °C. For
dehydration samples were stored in ice-cold 50% EtOH for 20 min at 4 °C. Next,
samples were kept in ice-cold 70% EtOH at 4 °C overnight. The next day, samples
were stored for 20 min in ice-cold 90% EtOH at 4 °C. After that, the samples were
stored 3× for 20 min in ice-cold 100% EtOH at 4 °C, 20 min in equal volumes of
Propylenoxid:EtOH at 4 °C and 2 × 20 min in pure Propylenoxid at 4 °C. For
transfering the samples to epon (20 g Epoxy, 11 g DDSA, 9 g NMA, 0.8 g DMP30)
samples were stored for 5 h in equal volumes of Epon:Propylenoxid at 4 °C.
Moreover, samples were incubated in 3:1 volumes of Epon:Propylenoxid overnight
at 4 °C. Fresh epon was used first to store the samples at 4 °C during the day as well
as overnight at 4 °C. On the next day, samples were immersed in fresh epon for 2 h
with opened lid. The final embedding was performed in a flat form in fresh epon
for 72 h at 62 °C. After embedding the samples, semi-thin sections (500 nm) were
cut with a Leica UC6 ultramicrotome to check the quality of the sample. After-
wards, ultrathin sections were produced. The sections were fit to the grid and
contrasted. The grid was incubated for 15 min in 1.5% aqueous Uranylacetate,
washed 5× in distilled H2O, incubated again for 4 min in lead citrate and washed
5× in distilled H2O. Finally, samples were checked with electron microscope Jeol
2100 Plus equipped with a Gatan camera.
Study participants. Paired samples of scWAT and omental vWAT were obtained
from 169 individuals (113 women, 56 men). The age ranged from 19 to 88 years
and BMIs from 18.9 to 73.1 kg/m². All adipose tissue samples were collected during
laparoscopic abdominal surgery64. Adipose tissue was immediately frozen in liquid
nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of
the University of Leipzig (approval no: 159-12-21052012), and performed in
accordance to the declaration of Helsinki. All subjects gave written informed
consent before taking part in this study. BMI was calculated by weight (kg) divided
by square of height (m). All baseline blood samples were collected between 8 and
10 am after an overnight fast. Plasma glucose, HbA1c, HDL-, LDL-cholesterol, free
fatty acids, and triglycerides were measured in an automated analyzer (Cobas 8000,
Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany).
Analysis of H19 expression. RNA from human scWAT and vWAT was extracted
by using RNeasy Lipid Tissue Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). Quantity and integrity
of RNA was monitored via spectrophotometry using NanoVue plus (GE Health-
care, Germany). A volume of 1 μg total RNA from scWAT and vWAT adipose
tissue were reverse transcribed with standard reagents (Life technologies, Ger-
many). cDNA was processed for TaqMan probe-based quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the QuantStudio 6 Flex Real-Time PCR
System (Life technologies, Germany). Expression of H19 was calculated by stan-
dard curve method and normalized to the expression of hypoxanthine guanine
phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (HPRT1) as housekeeping gene. TaqMan probes (Life
technologies, Germany) for H19 (Hs00262142_g1) and HPRT1 (Hs01003267_m1)
span exon-exon boundaries to improve the specificity of the qPCR.
CHART-MS. For ChART-MS, PIBA cells were seeded and either only grown to
confluency or induced to differentiate. The cells were washed with 1× PBS and
fixed with 1 % Formaldehyde for 10 min and fixation quenched with 0.125 M
Glycine. The cells were washed with ice-cold 1× PBS, scraped off and centrifuged
for 5 min at 100× g. The supernatant was aspirated and cells stored on −80 °C. The
cells were lysed in 400 μl lysis buffer, resuspended and stored on ice for 5 min. This
step was repeated and 0.1% of NP-40 was added to the lysis buffer. 1 ml of Sucrose
buffer was pipetted into a new tube. The lysed cells (max. 400 μl) were carefully
pipetted to the center of the sucrose buffer and samples centrifuged for 10 min at
7000× g at 4 °C. The lysis step with only 400 μl of lysis buffer and the sucrose step
was repeated. After centrifugation, supernatants were discarded and nuclei washed
with 1 ml PBS. The tube was centrifuged for 1 min at 7000× g, supernatants dis-
carded and 1 ml of PBS added. Suspensions were resuspended and vortexed until
achieving a single nucleus suspension. For crosslinking of nuclei 2% formaldehyde
was added for 30 min, tubes vortexed and stored for 30 min on a wheel at room
temperature. For quenching 0.125 M Glycine was added and samples centrifuged
for 1 min at 7000× g at 4 °C. Supernatants were discarded and nuclei washed with
1 ml PBS. The samples were centrifuged at 7000× g for 1 min. Washing was
repeated with 2 min of centrifugation in between. Supernatants were discarded and
300 μl nuclear lysis buffer and RNAse inhibitor added. Samples were vortexed and
incubated for 5 min on ice. PBS and protease inhibitor were added in equal
volumes to nuclear suspension and the suspensions vortexed. To lyse residual
nuclei a tip sonicator was used with the following conditions: 3× cycles 10%,
3 × 10 s, POWER 10%. The suspension was transferred into Diagenode TPX
microtubes and tubes sonicated with following conditions: Amplitude: 35%, 15 s
ON, 15 s OFF, 36 cycles, time: 9 min for appropriate shearing of mature brown
adipocyte chromatin. Afterwards, samples were centrifuged at 17,000× g for 5 min
and supernatants transferred to new tubes. Gross nucleic acid abundances were
quantified using a Nanodrop instrument and 75 μg chromatin mixed with RNAse
inhibitor and 650 pmol of oligonucleotides (OGNs) conjugated to Biotin-TEG.

 (Biotin-TEG increases OGN–biotin distances to ~15 atoms using a triethyle-
neglycol (TEG) spacer. Biotin-TEG therefore is used to avoid steric hindrances and
improve attachment of OGNs to beads.) Samples were vortexed carefully and spun
down, stored at 55 °C and shaked on 600 rpm for 10 min. Temperature was
decreased to room temperature and samples stored overnight at 55 °C. The beads
were mixed with 1 ml of Solution 1 (1 M NaCl and 0.1 % Tween), tubes vortexed,
centrifuged shortly and transferred to a magnetic rack. The beads were washed
3× with solution 1. In the meantime, samples were adjusted to 1 M NaCl, vortexed
and 50 μl of beads and RNase inhibitor added to the solution. The tubes were
stored on a rotator for 30 min at RT, centrifuged, stored in the magnetic rack and
supernatants discarded. Beads were washed 2× with 1 ml of Solution 1 and 3× with
1 ml of Solution 2 (1 M NaCl, 0.1% Tween, 0.1 % SDS). For this, solutions were
added, tubes vortexed and stored on a shaker 1050 rpm set to 16 °C for 5 min.
Afterwards, tubes were stored in the magnetic rack and supernatant discarded. For
the final elution, beads were resuspended in 300 μl elution buffer (0.2 M NaCl, 0.1%
SDS, 10 mM Tris pH = 8.0) and 1× Proteinase inhibitor. The samples were incu-
bated on a ThermoShaker for 4–5 h and shaken at 1450 rpm at 65 °C. Finally,
eluate was concentrated with Amicon Ultra-0,5 Centrifugal filter. To degrade RNA
contaminations, samples were treated with RNAse A. Sequences for H19 sense and
antisense oligonucleotides for RNA-immunoprecipitation are provided in Sup-
plementary Data 6.
Sample preparation for MS. DTT was added at a final concentration of 5 mM and
samples were incubated on 55 °C for 30 min. Afterwards, samples were cooled
down to room temperature and Cloroacetamid (CAA) added at final concentra-
tions of 40 mM for 30 min in the dark. Protein digestion was performed using the
Single-Pot Solid-Phase-enhanced Sample Preparation technology (experimental
details available upon request). In brief, 2 μL of a 10 mg/mL mixture of hydrophilic
and hydrophobic carboxylate coated paramagnetic beads (SeraMag Speed Beads,
Cat No. 44152105050250 and 24152105050250, GE Healthcare) were added to each
sample. Acidified acetonitrile was added to achieve a final concentration of 50%
organic solvent. Bound proteins were washed with 70 % ethanol and 100 %
acetonitrile. Beads were resuspended in 5 μL 50 mM Triethylammoniumbicarbo-
nate buffer containing 0.1 μg Trypsin (Sigma) and 0.1 μg LysC (Wako). Digestion
was carried out for 16 h at 37 °C in a PCR cycler to ensure constant temperatures.
Recovered peptides were resuspended in 1% formic acid / 5% DMSO and stored at
−20 °C prior to MS analysis.
Mass spectrometry. All samples were analyzed on a Q-Exactive Plus (Thermo
Scientific) mass spectrometer that was coupled to an EASY nLC 1000 UPLC
(Thermo Scientific). Peptides were loaded with solvent A (0.1% formic acid in
water) onto an in-house packed analytical column (50 cm × 75 μm I.D., filled with
2.7 μm Poroshell EC120 C18, Agilent). Peptides were chromatographically sepa-
rated at a constant flow rate of 250 nL/min using the following gradient: 5–30%
solvent B (0. 1% formic acid in 80% acetonitrile) within 119 min, 30–50% solvent B
within 19 min, followed by washing and column equilibration. The mass spec-
trometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode. The MS1 survey scan
was acquired from 300–1750 m/z at a resolution of 70,000. The top ten most
abundant peptides were isolated within a 2 Da window and subjected to HCD
fragmentation at a normalized collision energy of 27%. The AGC target was set to
5 × 10E5 charges, allowing a maximum injection time of 55 ms. Product ions were
detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 17,500. Precursors were dynamically
excluded for 20 s.
Bioinformatic analysis of MS data. All mass spectrometric raw data were pro-
cessed with Maxquant (version 1.5.3.8) using default parameters. Briefly,
MS2 spectra were searched against the Uniprot MOUSE.fasta database, including a
list of common contaminants. False discovery rates on protein and PSM level were
estimated by the target-decoy approach to 0.01% (Protein FDR) and 0.01% (PSM
FDR). Minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids and carbamidomethyo-
lation at cysteine residues was considered as a fixed modification. Oxidation (M)
and Acetyl (Protein N-term) were included as variable modifications. The match-
between runs option was enabled. LFQ quantification was enabled using default
settings. The Maxquant output was processed as follows: protein groups flagged as
reverse, potential contaminant or only identified by site were removed from the
proteinGroups.txt. The remaining table was analyzed with R. Protein groups with
at least two valid values out of three replicates (or 2 out of 2) in at least one of the
bait subgroups were directed to statistical analysis. The R STATS Package was used
to perform Student’s t-tests to obtain significantly changed proteins. Those pep-
tides with p-values < 0.05 and log2 fold-changes > 1 were considered as signficantly
different. Proteins that provide 2 or 3 valid values in one bait group and zero in the
other, were also considered as significantly different.
Ingenuity pathway analysis and AMIGO2 GO Term Analysis. In total 3590
peptides were detected by MS. All 168 uniquely identified and significantly enriched
(see significance criteria above) peptides with fold-changes ≥ 1.5 between H19 anti-
sense compared to sense oligonucleotide immunoprecipitation in confluent (n = 114)
or differentiated (n = 102) conditions were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathway Ana-
lysis. To construct a functionally interconnected H19 protein interactome, all n = 168
gene were loaded into IPA and gene nodes with n ≥ 1 edges to other genes retained.
For GO Term classification of the remaining n = 61 H19 interaction partners, cor-
responding Gene Symbols were loaded into AMIGO2 (http://amigo.geneontology.
org) and those proteins counted classified by GO Terms RNA binding or Chromatin
binding or Chromating modification.
Analyses of public datasets. PEG and MEG expression in WAT of 24 strains of
mice was extracted from publicly available datasets as described by Kraus et al.65,
Briefly, expression levels of PEGs and MEGs in WAT were obtained from [www.
BioGPS.org] - Adipose (MOE430 V2) Obesity-resistant versus obesity-prone is
defined based on body composition data from Svenson et al.66 and “Naggert1” in
the Mouse Phenome Database [www.jax.org/phnome], in which body composition
was measured in 43 different mouse stains that were fed a high-fat diet for 8 weeks.
Mouse line PL/J is not studied in Naggert1, but its percentage fat weight at
20 months of age is approximately one standard deviation below the average of 32
mouse strains in the Ackert1 data set [www.jax.org/phnome]. PEG and MEG
expression was analyzed by GSEA in surgically removed biopsies of WAT of future
high and low weight gainers from C57BL6/J mice biopsied prior to treatment with
high-fat diet53.
Serum analyses. Serum was obtained by allowing the blood to clot at 4 °C for 4 h.
The clotted blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 6200× g, the supernatants trans-
ferred to a new tube and centrifuged for another 10 min at 17,000× g. Serum was
collected and stored at −80 °C diluted 1:3 with 0.9% NaCl. For analysis of cho-
lesterole levels the Cholesterin CHOD-PAP (Roche Diagnostics) and to determine
trigycerides levels the Triglyceride GPO-PAP of Roche Diagnostics was used. Both
analyses were run with the Cobas C 702 (Roche Diagnostics). The analysis was
conducted at the Institute for clinical chemistry at the University Clinics in
Cologne.
Pyrosequencing. DNA methylation was analyzed by pyrosequencing. To this end,
1 μg DNA from 1°BAT transfected with siCtrl or siH19 was Bisulfite-converted
using the EZ DNA Methylation kit (Zymo), PCR amplified, sequenced on a
PyroMark Q96 (Qiagen), and analyzed with the PyroMark CpG SW 1.0 software
(Qiagen) as described recently67. Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary
Data 6.
