Context: Medical strategies targeting remission of type 2 diabetes have not been system-
atically studied.
Objective: This trial assessed the feasibility, safety, and potential to induce remission of a short-term
intensive metabolic strategy.
Design: A randomized, parallel, open-label pilot trial with 83 participants followed for 52 weeks.
Setting: Ambulatory care.
Participants: Patients with type 2 diabetes of up to 3 years in duration.
Interventions: Participants were randomized to: (1) an 8-week intensive metabolic intervention,
(2) a 16-week intensive metabolic intervention, or (3) standard diabetes care. During the intensive
intervention period, weight loss and normoglycemia were targeted using lifestyle approaches and
treatment with metformin, acarbose, and insulin glargine. Diabetes drugs were then discontinued
in the intervention groups and participants were followed for hyperglycemic relapse.
Primary Outcome: On-treatment normoglycemia.
Results: At 8 weeks, 50.0% of the 8-week intervention group vs 3.6% of controls achieved nor-
moglycemia on therapy [relative risk (RR), 14.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.97 to 99.38), and at
16 weeks, these percentages were 70.4% in the 16-week group and 3.6% in controls (RR, 19.7; 95%
CI, 2.83 to 137.13). Twelve weeks after completion of the intervention, 21.4% of the 8-week group
compared with 10.7% of controls (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.55 to 7.22) and 40.7% of the 16-week group
compared with 14.3% of controls (RR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 7.87) met hemoglobin A1C criteria for
complete or partial diabetes remission.
Conclusions: A short course of intensive lifestyle and drug therapy achieves on-treatment
normoglycemia and promotes sustained weight loss. It may also achieve prolonged, drug-free
diabetes remission and strongly supports ongoing studies of novel medical regimens targeting
remission. (J Clin Endocrinol Metab 102: 1596–1605, 2017)

 diabetes is the first step on the path of chronic, in-
creasingly complex therapeutic regimens. Recent data
suggest that this may not be inevitable and that diabetes
may be partially or even completely reversed, at least in
some patients. For example, short-term intensive insulin
therapy (1–12), oral diabetes drugs (9–11), intensive
lifestyle therapy (13–15), a low-carbohydrate Mediter-
ranean diet (16), or a very-low-calorie diet (17) can re-
verse diabetes in up to 40% of patients, and bariatric
surgery can induce diabetes remission in up to 95% of
patients (18–23). These data highlight the importance of
considering and testing alternative treatment paradigms
for type 2 diabetes that focus on reversing the disease
rather than simply controlling progressive hyperglyce-
mia. They also suggest that achieving normoglycemia
on therapy using one or more approaches may be an
important component of any remission strategy. We
therefore conducted a pilot trial to determine whether a
short-term intensive metabolic approach that targeted
fasting and postprandial normoglycemia and weight loss
using a combination of pharmacological and lifestyle
approaches was feasible and safe, and whether it showed
the potential to induce sustained diabetes remission.
Methods
Study design
This is a randomized, parallel, open-label pilot trial that
was conducted at the Hamilton Health Sciences in Hamilton,
Ontario, Canada. The trial was approved by Health Canada
and the Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board.
Participants
Participants were recruited through the Diabetes Care and
Research Program at Hamilton Health Sciences. They were
included if they were between 30 and 80 years of age with a
body mass index (BMI) $ 23 kg/m2 and type 2 diabetes diag-
nosed within 3 years prior to enrollment, and if they had a
hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) # 8.5% (69 mmol/mol) on no oral
diabetes drugs or #7.5% (58 mmol/mol) on either one diabetes
drug or half-maximal doses of two drugs at stable doses for at
least 8 weeks, had a negative pregnancy test and an agreement
to use a reliable method of birth control (in all females with
childbearing potential), were able to self-monitor capillary
blood glucose and willing to self-inject insulin, and when they
provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria included: current
insulin therapy; a history of hypoglycemia unawareness, severe
hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, or diabetic ketoacidosis; serum
creatinine $ 124 mmol/L; active liver disease, alanine trans-
ferase $ 2.5-fold the upper limit of normal, or excessive al-
cohol intake; cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease with
dependence on oxygen, inflammatory bowel disease, colonic
ulcers, recent or significant bowel surgery, predisposition to
bowel obstruction, any disease requiring systemic glucocorti-
coid treatment, or any major illness with a life expectancy
of ,3 years; history of any condition that significantly limited
participant’s ability to achieve moderate levels of physical
activity; or a history of hypersensitivity to metformin, acarbose,
or insulin glargine. We have expanded the HbA1C inclusion
criterion from 6.5% to 8.0% (48 to 64 mmol/mol) on no oral
diabetes drugs to #8.5% (69 mmol/mol) on no oral diabetes
drugs in February 2012 to increase recruitment. All participants
provided written informed consent and had a baseline elec-
trocardiogram to screen for any evidence of ischemic heart
disease or arrhythmia.
Randomization and masking
Eligible participants were randomized 1:1:1 to three groups:
(1) an 8-week intensive metabolic intervention followed by
cessation of all diabetes drugs; (2) a 16-week intensive metabolic
intervention followed by cessation of all diabetes drugs; or (3)
standard diabetes therapy using random permuted blocks of six
and nine. A randomization schedule was prepared by an in-
dependent statistician using a computer-generated random
number sequence. Allocation was performed through a central
computerized system to ensure concealment. Owing to the
nature of the study interventions, participants and research staff
were not blinded to treatment allocation. Laboratory personnel
were blinded to group assignment.
Procedures
Intervention groups
The two interventions only differed in their duration. They
comprised an intensive follow-up schedule during which life-
style therapy and treatment with insulin glargine, metformin,
and acarbose were reinforced. All other diabetes drugs were
discontinued. Participants met with the research nurse every
week for the first 8 weeks, and then every 2 weeks during weeks
9 to 16 in the 16-week intervention group. They were also
contacted by phone between study visits.
Lifestyle therapy comprised dietary and physical activity
intervention. A dietitian estimated participants’ baseline daily
energy requirements using the Mifflin–St. Jeor equation (24)
and activity level, encouraged participants to reduce their daily
caloric intake by 500 to 750 kcal/d by providing a suggested
meal plan, and reinforced caloric reduction during subse-
quent meetings. A kinesiologist prescribed an individualized
moderate-intensity exercise program, encouraged participants
to achieve $150 min of moderate intensity physical activity per
week by week 16 of the trial and to maintain it for the duration
of the trial, and led weekly small-group gym sessions. Partici-
pants were also provided with a pedometer (Accusplit Eagle
AE120XLM) and encouraged to work toward a goal of 10,000
steps/d. The overall lifestyle goal was to achieve and maintain
$5% reduction in baseline weight by week 28 of the trial.
Insulin glargine was started at 2 to 6 U subcutaneously at
bedtime and titrated daily in 1-U increments by the participant
and twice weekly in 2- to 4-U increments by the research
nurse to achieve a fasting capillary glucose between 4.0 and
5.3 mmol/L. Metformin-naive participants received 500 mg of
metformin orally once daily for 4 days, 500 mg twice daily for
4 days, and then 1000 mg twice daily. Acarbose was started at
25 mg orally once daily and titrated by 25 mg every 4 days to a
maximum of 50 mg three times daily. In patients already treated
with metformin or acarbose, these agents were titrated to
1000 mg of metformin twice daily and 50 mg of acarbose three
times daily or maximal tolerated doses. The overall goal was
to finish medication titration and achieve a fasting capillary

 glucose of 4.0 to 5.3 mmol/L by week 4 and to maintain this
target for the remaining duration of the intensive metabolic
intervention.
After completing the intensive metabolic intervention, par-
ticipants in both intervention groups stopped oral diabetes
drugs and tapered insulin to zero during a 5-day period. They
were encouraged to continue with lifestyle modifications and
regular glucose monitoring (at least three times per week) during
the maintenance phase of the trial. A 75-g oral glucose tolerance
test (OGTT) was done at 12 weeks after randomization in the 8-
week intervention group and at 20 and 28 weeks in all groups.
An OGTT was done earlier when fasting capillary glucose levels
rose to .7 mmol/L on $50% of home glucose readings in the
absence of an acute illness. Hyperglycemia relapse was defined
as a fasting plasma glucose $ 6.1 mmol/L or a 2-hour plasma
glucose $7.8 mmol/L on the OGTT. Participants who met
criteria for hyperglycemia relapse returned to standard glycemic
care by their usual diabetes care provider and did not have
further OGTTs.
Control group
Control group participants received standard lifestyle advice
and were also provided with a pedometer as an incentive to be
active. They received standard glycemic management by their
usual diabetes care provider for the duration of the trial. They
had a scheduled OGTT at 20 and 28 weeks and were asked to
hold diabetes drugs for 48 hours prior to the OGTT.
Follow-up
All participants were seen at 8, 16, 20, and 28 weeks after
randomization and were contacted by telephone at least once a
month between these visits. After week 28, all study participants
returned to their regular diabetes care provider who continued
to manage their diabetes and came back for one last study visit at
52 weeks after randomization. HbA1C was measured at 8, 20,
28, and 52 weeks. The European Quality of Life five-dimension
questionnaire (25–27) was collected at baseline, 20 weeks, and
28 weeks. It is a two-part instrument that includes a (1) five-item
descriptive system from which a weighted health utility index
score is derived ranging from 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health state),
and (2) a visual analog scale of perceived health status that
is ranked by the participant from 1 (poor) to 100 (perfect) at
the time of completion of the questionnaire.
Outcomes
Table 1 summarizes the various definitions of glycemic re-
sponseusedinthe study. The primaryoutcome wasnormoglycemia
on therapy defined as a mean fasting capillary glucose #
5.4 mmol/L and a mean 2-hour postprandial glucose #
6.8 mmol/L calculated from two 7-point glucose profiles
collected during week 8 (8-week group) and week 16 (16-week
group) of therapy. Secondary outcomes included HbA1C,
fasting plasma glucose, changes in weight, BMI, waist cir-
cumference, waist/hip ratio from baseline, hypoglycemic ep-
isodes, quality of life, recruitment rate, retention rate, and
adherence to therapy. We also evaluated diabetes remission
and regression outcomes based on the results of an OGTT
and HbA1C in participants remaining off glucose-lowering
drugs (see Table 1 for definitions). The OGTT-based definition
of complete diabetes remission was included in the study
protocol. Other definitions of remission and regression were
added before any statistical analyses were carried out by
treatment group.
OGTTs were performed after a minimum of an 8-hour fast.
Blood samples for plasma glucose were collected in a fluoride-
containing tube at 0 and 120 minutes after administration of a
75-g oral glucose load and submitted to the hospital labora-
tory within 20 minutes of collection. HbA1C was measured
in a clinical laboratory using methods calibrated to the In-
ternational Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory
Medicine method.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were performed using the intention-to-treat
principle. Participants lost to follow-up (N = 2) were pre-
sumed not to have achieved any diabetes remission. A x2 test (or
Fisher’s exact test) was used to compare dichotomous out-
comes, and a two-sample t test (or a nonparametric equivalent)
was used to compare continuous outcomes. A sample size of 126
participants was estimated to provide 90% power to show a risk
difference of $30% for achieving normoglycemia on therapy in
each intervention group vs the control group, assuming this
would be achieved in #5% of the control group. SAS version
9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) was used to perform statistical
analyses. The trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, identifier
NCT01181674.
Results
A total of 132 participants were screened and 83 (mean
age, 57 years; 52% females) were randomly allocated to
the 8-week metabolic intervention group (N = 28),
16-week metabolic intervention group (N = 27), and

 control group (N = 28) between 11 February 2011 and
9 January 2014. Overall, two (2.4%) control group
participants did not complete the study and had no
follow-up glucose tolerance tests or HbA1C results
available (Fig. 1). At baseline, the mean [standard de-
viation (SD)] duration of diabetes was 14.6 (10.6)
months, HbA1C was 6.6% (0.6%) [49 (6.6) mmol/mol],
BMI was 33.2 (5.8) kg/m2, and 66 (79.5%) participants
were taking oral glucose-lowering drugs. Baseline char-
acteristics of the study participants are summarized
in Table 2, and they were not significantly different
when compared between each intervention group and
the control group.
Glycemic outcomes in the 8-week group
The mean (SD) fasting and 2-hour capillary glucose
levels during week 8 of therapy were 5.3 (0.6) and 6.4
(0.9) mmol/L in the intervention group and 7.3 (1.5) and
8.3 (1.7) mmol/L in the control group. Normoglycemia
on therapy was achieved in 14 (50.0%) of participants in
the intervention group and one (3.6%) in the control
group [relative risk (RR), 14.0; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 1.97 to 99.38].
Four weeks after completion of the intervention (Fig.
2), two (7.1%) participants in both the intervention and
control groups met the OGTT criteria for complete di-
abetes remission (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.15 to 6.61). At this
time, 10 (35.7%) participants in the intervention group
and two (7.1%) in the control group had either partial
or complete diabetes remission (RR, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.20
to 20.79).
Twelve weeks after completion of the intervention
(Fig. 2), two (7.1%) participants in both the intervention
and control groups met the OGTT criteria for complete
remission as well as for partial or complete remission (RR
for both, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.15 to 6.61). At this time, the
HbA1C diabetes remission criteria (Fig. 3) indicated that
three (10.7%) intervention participants vs one (3.6%)
control participant maintained complete diabetes re-
mission (RR, 3.00; 95% CI, 0.33 to 27.12); six (21.4%)
vs three (10.7%) participants maintained partial or com-
plete remission (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.55 to 7.22); and
eight (28.6%) vs four (14.3%) participants had either
diabetes regression or remission (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.68
to 5.89).
At 52 weeks (44 weeks after completion of the in-
tervention), four (14.3%) intervention participants vs
two (7.1%) control participants maintained complete
diabetes remission (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.40 to 10.05);
seven (25.0%) vs three (10.7%) maintained either partial
or complete remission (RR, 2.33; 95% CI, 0.67 to 8.12);
and eight (28.6%) vs four (14.3%) had either diabetes
regression or remission (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 0.68 to 5.89)
based on the HbA1C criteria.

 Glycemic outcomes in the 16-week group
The mean (SD) fasting and 2-hour capillary glucose
levels during week 16 of therapy were 4.9 (0.5) and 6.0
(0.7) mmol/L in the intervention group and 6.8 (1.1) and
7.8 (1.9) mmol/L in the control group. Normoglycemia
on therapy was achieved in 19 (70.4%) of participants in
the intervention group and one (3.6%) in the control
group (RR, 19.7; 95% CI, 2.83 to 137.13).
Four weeks after completion of the intervention, four
(14.8%) participants in the intervention group and two
(7.1%) in the control group met the OGTT criteria for
complete diabetes remission (RR, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.41 to
10.41; Fig. 2). At this time, 12 (44.4%) participants in the
intervention group and two (7.1%) in the control group
had either partial or complete diabetes remission (RR,
6.22; 95% CI, 1.53 to 25.24).
Twelve weeks after completion of the intervention
(Fig. 2), two (7.4%) participants in the intervention
group vs one (3.6%) in the control group met the OGTT
criteria for complete remission (RR, 2.08; 95% CI, 0.20
to 21.56), and two (7.4%) intervention vs three (10.7%)
control participants had either partial or complete di-
abetes remission (RR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.13 to 3.82). At this
time, the HbA1C remission criteria (Fig. 3) indicated that
four (14.8%) intervention vs two (7.1%) control par-
ticipants maintained complete diabetes remission (RR,
2.07; 95% CI, 0.41 to 10.41); 11 (40.7%) vs four
(14.3%) participants maintained partial or complete
remission (RR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.03 to 7.87); and 13
(48.2%) vs four (14.3%) participants had either diabetes
regression or remission (RR, 3.37; 95% CI, 1.25 to 9.05).
At 52 weeks (36 weeks after completion of the in-
tervention), one (3.7%) intervention participant vs two
(7.1%) control participants maintained complete di-
abetes remission (RR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.05 to 5.39); six
(22.2%) vs three (10.7%) maintained either partial or
complete remission (RR, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.58 to 7.47);
and seven (25.9%) vs four (14.3%) had either diabetes
regression or remission (RR, 1.81; 95% CI, 0.60 to 5.50)
based on the HbA1C criteria.

 (1.94 to 17.8), respectively]. The mean (SD) percentage
weight loss from baseline peaked at 20 weeks after ran-
domization and was 3.1% (3.4%) in the 8-week group,
5.1% (3.3%) in the 16-week group, and 1.4% (2.4%) in
controls. The mean (SD) decrease in waist circumference
observed at 20 weeks was 3.2 (2.4) cm in the 8-week
group, 4.3 (3.5) cm in the 16-week group, and 1.3 (2.3) cm
in controls.
During the induction phase of the trial (intensive
metabolic intervention period), 21 (38.2%) participants in
the intervention groups required a reduction in dose or
temporary withholding of at least one study medication.
Seven (12.7%) participants stopped one study medication
permanently due to side effects (six participants stopped
acarbose and one stopped insulin glargine). The mean (SD)
daily insulin glargine doses at the end of the induction
phase were 27.5 (16.5) U in the 8-week group and 21.2
(12.8) U in the 16-week group. The mean daily insulin
doses were 17.2 (14.8) U in participants who achieved
remission 12 weeks after stopping diabetes drugs and 27.8
(14.1) U in those who did not achieve remission.
At 28 weeks or at the time of hyperglycemia relapse if it
occurred earlier, intervention group participants returned
to their regular diabetes care provider. At 52 weeks after
randomization, eight (28.8%) of participants were on no
diabetes drugs, 16 (57.1%) were on one agent, and four
(14.3%) were on two agents in the 8-week group; 11
(40.7%) were on no drugs, 14 (51.9%) were on one
agent, and two (7.4%) were on two agents in the 16-week
group; and 10 (35.7%) were on no drugs, 11 (39.3%)
were on one agent, six (21.4%) were on two agents, and
one (3.6%) was on three agents in the control group (see
Supplemental Table 1 for details). There were no serious
adverse events related to the study drugs and no severe

 hypoglycemic episodes among study participants. Non-
severe symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes were ob-
served in nine (32.1%) participants in the 8-week group,
10 (37.0%) participants in the 16-week group, and one
(3.6%) participant in the control group. Other events
observed during the trial are summarized in the Sup-
plemental Table 2. The European Quality of Life five-
dimension health utility index and visual analog scale
baseline scores and changes in scores from baseline to
20 and 28 weeks were not significantly different when
compared between each intervention group and the

Discussion
This randomized controlled pilot trial showed that a
short-term, intensive metabolic intervention targeting
fasting and postprandial normoglycemia and weight
loss was feasible and safe, and capable of achieving
normoglycemia in .50% of patients and inducing $5%
weight loss in .35% of patients with recently diagnosed
type 2 diabetes. The intervention was implemented by a
nurse, dietitian, and kinesiologist and included frequent
visits, individualized dietary, physical activity, and drug
titration advice, and assistance with setting and attaining
lifestyle goals. The recruitment rate of two to three par-
ticipants per month at one site and no losses to follow-up
in the intervention groups suggest that the intervention
was highly accepted. The finding that up to 41% of the
intervention group participants maintained partial or
complete diabetes remission 12 weeks after stopping
diabetes drugs challenges the notion that type 2 diabetes
is a permanent and progressive disease as previously
thought (28–30), and it suggests that it might be possible
to achieve diabetes remission by using a combination of
lifestyle and pharmacological approaches. Future trials
with at least 1 year of active follow-up off drugs will be
able to provide 1-year remission rates when using the

Complete diabetes remission was defined as HbA1C , 6.0% (42 mmol/mol) and no chronic diabetes drugs. Partial or complete diabetes
remission was defined as HbA1C , 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and no chronic diabetes drugs. Diabetes regression or remission was defined as
HbA1C , 7.0% (53 mmol/mol) and no chronic diabetes drugs.

 proposed therapeutic approach. The trial findings also
suggest that an 8-week course of intensive metabolic
therapy may not be sufficient for inducing remission, and
an induction therapy of a longer duration might be needed.
Previous trials of medical interventions for diabetes
have yielded results that are consistent with the present
findings related to the feasibility of achieving remission of
type 2 diabetes. One trial (10) with 382 participants with
newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes reported that 45% to
51% of patients who achieved tight glycemic goals with
short-term intensive insulin therapy and 27% of those
who achieved glycemic goals with oral agents maintained
remission after 1 year of follow-up. Similarly, 20.9% of
newly diagnosed patients who achieved tight glycemic
goal with short-term oral drug therapy and 37.9% of
those who achieved this glycemic goal with oral drugs
plus insulin maintained good glycemic control without
medication for 1 year (11). In another trial in people with a
longer duration of diabetes, intensive lifestyle approaches
vs standard diabetes support and education achieved
partial or complete diabetes remission in 11.5% vs 2% of
participants during the first year of follow-up (13).
The strengths of our study include a randomized
controlled design with predefined outcomes, intention-
to-treat analyses, high adherence, few losses to follow-up,
and inclusion of people with new and established di-
abetes. Limitations include conducting the study at one
site, the short follow-up period, and the fact that par-
ticipants returned to usual diabetes care as soon as they
had evidence of abnormal glucose tolerance. Neverthe-
less, this trial clearly shows that a multifaceted intensive
metabolic strategy that targets normoglycemia and weight
loss using pharmacological and lifestyle approaches
may achieve remission, is acceptable to patients, and
may be easily translated into clinical practice. The trial
supports further research focused on identifying the
most efficacious combinations of therapies to induce
diabetes remission, and testing whether these approaches
can reduce adverse health consequences of type 2 di-
abetes, improve quality of life, and reduce the burden of
illness associated with type 2 diabetes.
