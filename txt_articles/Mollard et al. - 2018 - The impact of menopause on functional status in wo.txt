Abstract
Objective. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of menopause with functional status
outcomes in women with RA.
Methods. Participants were women in a US-wide observational cohort who developed RA before meno-
pause. The HAQ measured functional status. We controlled for confounding variables and used univariate
and multivariable generalized estimating equation methods with the sandwich estimator of variance. Best
models were selected using the quasi-likelihood under the independence model criterion. A sensitivity
analysis was performed using linear mixed effects regression models.
Results. A total of 8189 women were eligible. Of these, 2005 (24.5%) were pre-menopausal, 611 (7.5%)
transitioned through menopause during the study, and 5573 (68.1%) were post-menopausal. Within each
respective group, the mean (S.D.) ages were 39.7 (7.8), 50.7 (3.4) and 62.3 (9.3) years. Our results showed
that women who were pre-menopausal had less functional decline as measured by the HAQ compared
with women who were post-menopausal; these results were robust and strong even after adjustment for
other significant factors. The ever-use of hormonal replacement therapy, ever having a pregnancy, and
longer length of reproductive life were associated with less functional decline. After menopause, the
trajectory of functional decline worsened and accelerated in women with RA.
Conclusion. The results suggest that menopausal status is associated with functional decline in women
with RA. Furthermore, menopause is associated with a worsening progression of functional decline. These
data indicate that menopause has a significant impact on the level and rate of functional decline in women
with RA.

Rheumatology key messages
. Women with RA have better functional status prior to menopause, even after controlling for covariates.
. After menopause, the trajectory of functional decline worsens in women with RA.
. Pregnancy, HRT and more reproductive years are associated with less functional decline in women with RA.
Introduction
Physical function is an important outcome in RA that de-
termines a patient’s ability to complete activities of daily
living, as well as their quality of life (QoL). Women, who
experience RA at a rate three times greater than men [1],
also experience more severe functional decline and
increased disability compared with men who have RA
[2]. The sex-based differences in RA development and
progression have long been identified, but remain poorly
understood.

 Several
differences
in
prevalence,
incidence
and
phenotypic characteristics highlight the disparity between
men and women with RA. Women with RA do worse than
men with RA as measured through patient-reported out-
comes (PROs). Women with RA report greater rates of
pain [3], higher rates of disease-related fatigue [4], more
persistent disease [5] and a lower QoL [6] compared with
men with RA. Some variability may be related to differ-
ences in muscular anatomy, allowing men to compensate
better for RA-related dysfunction [7]. Women may have
more activated immune systems, exhibiting more power-
ful cellular and humoral immune responses than men [8],
thus making their disease experience more pronounced.
Additionally, disease experience, pain perception and
coping strategies vary between sexes [9].
Women experience shifts in their disease surrounding
reproductive and hormonal life events. RA hormonal in-
volvement in women is most pronounced surrounding
childbirth. Women with RA have a decreased incidence
of RA during pregnancy, yet an increased incidence of dis-
ease development and flare during the postpartum period
[10]. Women who experience early menopause are more
likely to develop RA compared with women who experi-
ence a normal or late menopause [11]. Development of
RA and disease-related activity have been associated
with use of oral contraception (OC) and hormone replace-
ment therapy (HRT), with inconsistent results [12].
Given that women have changes in disease develop-
ment and progression surrounding reproductive and hor-
monal events, we wondered how menopause would affect
a woman’s PRO of functional status. The purpose of this
study was to explore the relationship between menopause
and functional status in women who have RA.
Methods
Design
This was a longitudinal study using data from the National
Data Bank for Rheumatic Diseases (NDB). The NDB has
Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval from the Via
Christi IRB, and informed patient consent to be included
in the NDB was obtained. The analysis of deidentified
NDB data for this study was approved by the University
of Nebraska Medical Center IRB. The HAQ measured
functional status. NDB participants complete a question-
naire every 6 months that includes the HAQ. Demographic
characteristics and reproductive items, such as date of
last menstrual period, are included in each questionnaire.
Inclusion criteria for this study were women participating
in the NDB who had an RA diagnosis before menopause,
with at least two completed questionnaires between 2003
and 2017. Women were excluded if they had a hysterec-
tomy, were currently pregnant, had menopause before the
age of 40 years, or if they were over the age of 55 years
and did not report a menstruation cessation date.
Menopausal stage
Menopausal stage was determined based on survey
response. Women were classified as menopausal if they
responded that they were menopausal or responded that
they had not experienced a menstrual period for 1 year
and were not on a hormonal contraceptive. Women were
divided into three groups for comparison: pre-menopausal,
post-menopausal and transitioning through menopause.
Women were included as transitioning through menopause
if they had completed at least two questionnaires, were not
using hormonal contraceptives, and had at least one ques-
tionnaire indicating menstruating and at least one indicating
not menstruating or menopausal.
We compared HAQ scores between the three groups
and measured the changes in HAQ for these women. This
was calculated by computing consecutive differences on
HAQ disability divided by the difference in time (in years)
between two observations for each patient.
Other variables
The
following
confounding
variables
were
included:
income; age; length of reproductive life (for post-meno-
pausal women this was age from menarche to meno-
pause, whereas for pre-menopausal women this was
years from menarche to current age); education level;
RA duration; rheumatic disease co-morbidity index; ever
smoked; biologic therapy current use; biologic therapy
ever-use; HRT ever-use; OC ever-use; and ever pregnant.
The search for best model was conducted using this set of
variables.
Other variables characterizing RA severity, such as pa-
tient activity scale, rheumatoid arthritis disease activity
index, the short form (36) health survey physical compo-
nent summary and mental component summary, global
severity and pain, were included in the baseline charac-
terization but not in the models because they were highly
correlated with the HAQ. The variables characterizing
menstrual status, such as age at menarche and age at
menopause, were used indirectly by entering length of
reproductive life into the models. HRT, OC or pregnancies
were used as ever-variables owing to lack of variation
between groups.
Statistical analyses
We analysed the data with univariate and multivariable
generalized estimating equations (GEEs). GEEs are helpful
in longitudinal samples where the subjects respond to the
same questions over time and the researcher wishes to
determine and power for both within-subject and be-
tween-subject correlations. To estimate the entire distri-
bution with accurate predictability, we used the identity
link function and the Gaussian family distribution for the
HAQ. For parameter estimation, we applied the robust
covariance
matrix
estimator
(sandwich
estimator)
in
order to provide consistent estimates of the variance�co-
variance matrix. We performed a sensitivity analysis using
mixed effect regression models (MRMs).
The way in which NDB addresses missing data is ex-
plained elsewhere [13]. Missing covariate data on com-
pleted
questionnaires
were
handled
using
multiple
imputation by chained equations (7% missing in total
income is the worst case variable). For reproductive

 variables, such as age at menarche or menopausal status,
the last observation was carried forward. When more than
one value of age was given longitudinally by the patient,
the most frequent value was assumed. Results were con-
sidered using the average, but no differences were found.
To account for the likelihood that the relationship be-
tween age and HAQ would be non-linear, a cubic spline
with three knots (at ages 42, 58 and 74 years) and an
interaction term between age and menopausal status
were used. Best models were selected using the quasi-
likelihood under the independence model criterion (QICu).
This criterion was used in a forward selection approach.
The relationship of age and HAQ was assessed by com-
paring several models: linear, polynomial and by cubic
splines exploring several knot values. The introduction of
the interaction with menstrual status was also explored
with the QICu selection. Analyses were conducted using
Stata v. 14 by StataCorp (College Station, TX, USA).
Results
A total of 8189 women participating in our study de-
veloped RA before menopause. Of these, 2005 were
pre-menopausal (24.5%) at enrolment, 611 transitioned
through menopause during the study (7.5%), and 5573
were post-menopausal (68.1%). Within each respective
group, the mean (S.D.) ages were 39.7 (7.8), 50.7 (3.4)
and 61.8 (9.8) years. Table 1 includes the distribution of
the completed follow-up questionnaires, with median
values of 2, 7.5 and 4 years, respectively. It also shows
demographic and clinical characteristics of women ac-
cording to menopausal status (pre- and post-menopausal
at a random observation, and menopause transition group
measured at the first observation without menstrual
cycles). Groups differed in demographic and clinical char-
acteristics, which was expected because of the inter-
action between age and menopausal status.
In interpreting the HAQ, negative values indicate less
functional decline and therefore better functional status,
whereas positive values represent more functional decline
and worsening functional status. Our results showed that
women who were pre-menopausal had a better HAQ
score by �0.50 (95% CI: �0.55, �0.19) compared with
women who were post-menopausal [with interaction
term with age of 0.01 (0.00; 0.01)], indicating that pre-
menopausal women had less functional decline than
post-menopausal women. This estimate adjusted for age
modelled by the three-knot cubic spline and interaction
term of age and menstrual status. The change in mean
response of HAQ between pre- and post-menopausal
women, when all other variables were held constant
in the model, was a function of �0.50 + 0.01*age. The
difference in HAQ scores indicating less functional decline
in pre-menopausal women was robust even after adjust-
ment for other significant factors, including all of the
covariates described in Other variables except for OC
ever-use. When analysed by menopausal status, the
HAQ is a function �0.74 + 0.014*age [b-coefficient of
�0.74 (�1.02, �0.45) and interaction term with age
0.014 (0.008, 0.019); Fig. 1]. This translates to a mean
difference in HAQ scores between pre- and post-meno-
pausal women of �0.18 for a 40-year-old woman, �0.11
for a 45-year-old woman and �0.04 for a 50-year-old
woman, etc. The ever-use of HRT, having had a preg-
nancy, and longer duration of reproductive life were asso-
ciated with less functional decline. OC ever-use did not
qualify for the multivariable model according to QICu.
When using menopausal status with the three groups
for the same multivariate model, HAQ scores of post-
menopausal women were increased (worsened) by 0.68
(0.36, 1.00) compared with pre-menopausal women [inter-
action term with age �0.012 (�0.019, �0.006)]. Women
who transitioned through menopause during the study
had an increased HAQ of 0.28 (0.002, 0.490) when com-
pared with pre-menopausal women [interaction term with
age �0.006 (�0.010, �0.000)].
The results indicate that the annual change of HAQ
(a positive value represents worsening and a negative
value an improvement) was worsened for post-meno-
pausal women when compared with pre-menopausal
women. This was true for age-adjusted analysis [HAQ pro-
gression rate/year: �1.38 (�1.98, �0.77) with interaction
term 0.01 (0.00, 0.02)] and after adjusting for several con-
founders: total income, tumour necrosis factor inhibitor
use, co-morbidities and baseline HAQ [rates/year: �1.49
(�2.08, �0.91) with interaction term 0.027 (0.02, 0.04)].
This translates into an average annual HAQ change be-
tween pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women of
�1.49 (�2.07, �0.90). By age, for example, a pre-meno-
pausal 40-year-old woman would have an annual HAQ
change of �0.61 (�0.94, �0.28), whereas a post-meno-
pausal woman of the same age would have a change of
0.88 (0.59, 1�16). Similar estimates for women of 50 years
old would be �0.88 (�1.28; �0.47) and �0.61 (0.42, 0.80)
for pre-menopausal and post-menopausal, respectively.
To confirm results, we performed a sensitivity analysis
using MRM. GEE models assume a missing completely at
random approach and MRM a missing at random ap-
proach. If a missing dropout were not dependent on the
available measures, the two models would give similar
results [14]. The MRM results were similar and confirmed
the conclusions of the GEE. MRMs were estimated includ-
ing a random slope for menstrual status with an unstruc-
tured covariance structure. Average predictions from the
GEE model and MRM model for menstrual status were:
GEE 0.55 (95% CI: 0.33, 1.35) and MRM 0.50 (0.31, 0.69)
for pre-menopausal women; and GEE 1.28 (95% CI: 1.21,
1.35) and MRM 1.29 (1.22, 1.35) for post-menopausal
women.
Discussion
We explored how menopause impacts functional status in
women with RA. In our study, women who were post-
menopausal had worse functional status and a more
severe progression of functional decline as measured by
the HAQ.
Our results suggest further study on hormonal involve-
ment in functional decline in women with RA. In addition to
worsening functional status after menopause, women

 who had longer length of reproductive life, were ever
pregnant or ever-used HRT, and thus had increased hor-
monal exposure, had less functional decline. Longitudinal
studies with hormonal biomarkers in women surrounding
the menopausal and other reproductive transitions are
indicated. Studies with matched control cases with com-
parison in men may elucidate sex-specific hormone-
related changes. Additional study on RA symptoms and
functional status throughout the menstrual cycle and other
hormonal life events are indicated in understanding hor-
monal involvement in RA disease status.
There were multiple limitations to our study. We did not
establish a directional relationship between menopause
and functional decline. We may not have accounted for
all confounding variables. Although PROs are standard in
collecting data about physical function and patient experi-
ence, self-reported data are associated with biases and
may not correlate with the patient’s objective clinical pic-
ture. For example, menopause has been associated with
depression and decreased QoL and may have changed
the patient’s perceptual experience of their functional

 status. The study participants had a higher socioeco-
nomic status and may have been more compliant than
patients with RA in the general population. Some vari-
ables, such as ever-pregnancy and ever-use of HRT,
have been associated with healthier women in general,
thus affecting the interpretation of our results.
In conclusion, the results from this large observational
study suggest that menopause is associated with worse
functional decline in women with RA. Further study is
needed to understand this relationship.
