AIMS
To assess safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and clinical efficacy of bimekizumab (formerly UCB4940), a novel humanized monoclonal
antibody and dual inhibitor of interleukin (IL)-17A and IL-17F, in subjects with mild plaque psoriasis.
METHODS
Randomized, double-blind, first-in-human study of bimekizumab in 39 subjects who received single-dose intravenous
bimekizumab (8–640 mg) or placebo (NCT02529956).
RESULTS
Bimekizumab demonstrated dose-proportional linear PK and was tolerated across the dose range assessed. No subject
discontinued due to treatment-emergent adverse events and no severe adverse events were reported. Bimekizumab demon-
strated fast onset of clinically-meaningful effects on skin of patients with mild psoriasis as early as Week 2. Maximal improvements
(100% or near 100% reductions from baseline) in all measures of disease activity were observed between Weeks 8–12 in subjects
receiving 160–640 mg bimekizumab. The duration of effect at doses ≥160 mg was evident up to Weeks 12–20 after a single in-
travenous dose, dependent on endpoint.
CONCLUSIONS
This is the first study to demonstrate the safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor, in subjects
with mild psoriasis. Bimekizumab showed fast onset of clinically-meaningful efficacy by Week 2, with a maximal or near-maximal
magnitude of response that was maintained up to study Weeks 12–20. These findings support the continued clinical development
of bimekizumab for diseases mediated by both IL-17A and IL-17F, including psoriasis.

 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS SUBJECT
• Interleukin (IL)-17A, and potentially IL-17F, are believed to drive pathogenesis in psoriasis.
• Targeting the IL-17 pathway with anti-IL-17A antibodies has demonstrated clinical efficacy in subjects with moderate-to-
severe psoriasis.
• Inhibition of the IL-17 pathway may leave subjects more vulnerable to infection; neutropenia is a potential anti-IL-17
class effect.
WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS

Introduction
Psoriasis is a chronic and debilitating immune-mediated in-
flammatory skin disease that affects 1–3% of the worldwide
population [4]. Approximately 80% of individuals with psori-
asis have mild-to-moderate forms of the disease [5]. People
with psoriasis typically develop erythematosus and scaly
plaques on their skin, and extent of skin surface involvement
is a key determinant of disease severity [5]. Beyond physical
symptoms, psoriasis imposes a substantial psychosocial bur-
den on individuals and many struggle to cope with the stigma
associated with their disease [6]. Moreover, it has been re-
ported that psoriasis can impair quality of life to the same ex-
tent as clinically severe conditions such as cancer and
diabetes [4]. Psoriasis is also associated with significant co-
morbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and de-
pression [7]. Current treatment recommendations are based
on psoriasis symptom severity: topical creams (corticoste-
roids and vitamin D3) for mild-to-moderate disease; and sys-
temic or phototherapies for moderate-to-severe disease [5].
The aetiology of psoriasis is poorly understood; however,
it is known to have an immune-mediated pathogenesis [8].
Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) plays a role in the pathogenesis
of psoriasis [9] and biological treatments include TNF inhibi-
tors (adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab) [10]. Interleu-
kin (IL)-17 also plays a critical role in psoriasis [8]. Release of
IL-17 triggers a proinflammatory signalling cascade in skin
keratinocytes,
which
is
believed
to
drive
chronic
inflammation in conditions such as psoriasis [11]. IL-17 fam-
ily members share a structural similarity, which is particularly
evident in the IL-17A and IL-17F isoforms [11]. IL-17A is path-
ogenic in mouse models of immune-inflammatory disease,
with IL-17F considered less important [12]. In humans, IL-
17A and IL-17F are key proinflammatory cytokines that share
similar and overlapping biological functions [13, 14]. Both
are drivers of chronic inflammation and coexpressed in
immune-inflammatory diseases [14, 15]. Although there are
limited studies in humans, there is evidence for a role for IL-
17F in the pathogenesis of psoriasis [16, 17].
The use of agents targeting the IL-17 pathway has been
evaluated extensively in clinical studies for psoriasis [8] with
therapeutic interventions either approved or in clinical de-
velopment. Notably, secukinumab (IL-17A inhibitor) is now
approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque pso-
riasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis in the
USA and EU [18, 19]. Ixekizumab (IL-17A inhibitor) is also ap-
proved for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe
plaque psoriasis in the USA and EU [20, 21]. Brodalumab (IL-
17RA blocker) is under clinical development for moderate-to-
severe psoriasis [8, 22, 23]. Inhibitors of the IL-17RA receptor,
such as brodalumab, exert broad blockade, encompassing in-
hibition of not only IL-17A and IL-17F but also IL-25 (IL-17E);
IL-25 has anti-inflammatory effects in human cells [24].
The currently approved agents have demonstrated clini-
cal efficacy in subjects with moderate-to-severe plaque psori-
asis [25–28], and are considered generally well tolerated [29].

 However, IL-17A and IL-17F have a critical function in adap-
tive immune defence from bacterial and fungal infection,
and inhibition of this action could potentially leave subjects
more vulnerable to infection [30]. In clinical studies involv-
ing anti-IL-17A or anti-IL-17 receptor inhibitors, the most
common adverse events (AEs) reported by subjects included:
worsening of disease, upper respiratory tract infections,
headache, nausea and nasopharyngitis [29]. Neutropenia is
also a potential class effect, specifically reported in subjects
who have received secukinumab, ixekizumab or brodalumab
[26–28].
Bimekizumab (formerly UCB4940) is a novel humanized
monoclonal antibody of the immunoglobulin G1 isotype, ra-
tionally designed to be able to bind at a similar site on both
IL-17A and IL-17F, conveying dual inhibition of both iso-
forms. Comparing this unique mechanism of action with
other agents, bimekizumab might improve therapeutic effi-
cacy through its potent selectivity for the IL-17A and IL-17F
isoforms. Bimekizumab is in early clinical development in
several indications, including psoriasis. Here we report the
safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and effect on clini-
cal features of plaque psoriasis of single-dose bimekizumab in
a first-in-human study of subjects with mild psoriasis.
Methods
Study design
This was a Phase I, first-in-human, randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled,
single-dose,
dose-escalating
study
(NCT02529956). It was conducted in accordance with the ap-
plicable
regulatory
and
International
Conference
on
Harmonisation – Good Clinical Practice requirements, the
ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki,
and local laws. The protocol was reviewed and approved by
the National Research Ethics Service Committee South
Central-Berkshire (Research Ethics Committee reference:
12/SC/0564). All subjects provided documented consent
prior to study entry. Treatment administration and data col-
lection were carried out at a single clinical pharmacology site
in the UK.
Each subject underwent a ≤19-day screening period,
followed by predosing assessments over a 2-day period, prior
to infusion of bimekizumab or placebo. Subjects were ran-
domized
to
one
of
six
treatment
groups
to
receive:
bimekizumab single intravenous infusion dose of 8, 40, 160,
480 or 640 mg, or placebo. A safety follow-up (SFU) period
was also included in the study; subjects were evaluated dur-
ing a 20-week period after dosing.
Study treatment
Dosing.
Each subject received a single intravenous infusion
of bimekizumab (at the dose specified for that cohort), or
placebo over a duration of ≥60 min. Subjects were assigned
sequentially to cohorts and were randomly assigned to
study treatment. The first treatment group received the
lowest
dose,
8
mg,
bimekizumab,
or
placebo;
dose
escalations were based on reviews of the safety, PK and
laboratory data from the previous cohort.
Study population
The key inclusion criteria for this study were: male or female
(age ≥18 to ≤70 years); subjects with a confirmed diagnosis
of mild-to-moderate plaque-type psoriasis for ≥6 months in-
volving ≤5% of body surface area (excluding the scalp); and
at least two psoriatic lesions with at least one plaque in suit-
able biopsy sites. Key exclusion criteria included: use of sys-
temic
nonbiological
psoriasis
therapy
(methotrexate,
steroids or cyclophosphamide) or psoralen plus UVA/UVB
phototherapy within 4 weeks prior to screening; and treat-
ment with biological agents ≤12 months before the study.
Objectives
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety of single-
dose bimekizumab. Secondary objectives were to characterize
the PK profile of single-dose bimekizumab and to assess its ef-
fects on clinical features of plaque psoriasis. An exploratory
objective was to assess the immunogenicity of bimekizumab.
Study outcome variables
Safety.
Safety variables were assessed during this study, e.g.
AEs, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) data, clinical
chemistry, haematology (including coagulation/haemostasis
tests) and urinalysis. All variables were assessed during the
study predose and 0–48-h postdrug time points, all safety
variables except ECG data were assessed during the study
screening period. Additionally, AEs were assessed at each
time point up to Week 20 of the postinfusion SFU period;
vital signs were monitored during Weeks 1–20 of the SFU.
Clinical
chemistry
and
haematology
parameters
were
assessed at Weeks 1–4, and Weeks 8, 12 and 20. Urinalysis
was measured at Weeks 1, 4, 12 and 20.
Pharmacokinetics.
Bimekizumab
concentrations
were
determined in plasma using a sandwich ligand-binding
assay and visualized using electrochemiluminescence. The
assay
had
a
range
of
quantitation
between
150
and
18 000 ng ml–1. The inter- and intraday assay precision, as
determined by coefficient of variation, was ≤20%. The
impact of interference was not evaluated. Blood samples
were taken predose, then at 0–48 h, 72 h and 96 h postdose,
and during Weeks 1–20 of the SFU.
Immunogenicity.
Plasma samples were also used to test for
the detection of anti-bimekizumab antibodies at predose,
Week 4 and Week 20 of the SFU period.
Effects on clinical features of plaque psoriasis.
Lesion severity
score (LSS), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) and
hysicianˈs Global Assessment (PGA) of disease severity
were
investigated.
LSS
was
assessed
using
five-point
severity scales of lesion redness, induration and scaling
(0 = none, 4 = severe), on separate psoriatic lesions to
those
taken
for
biopsy.
PASI
was
assessed
by
the
investigator, based on a five-point scale, as for LSS. PASI
scores ranged from 0 to 72 (higher scores indicating more
severe disease [31]). PGA was assessed by the investigator
based on their impression of disease severity. A seven-
point scale was used to grade PGA (0 = clear, 6 = severe).

993
 These variables were measured during the predose and
dosing periods, and during Weeks 1–20 of SFU.
Statistical methods
This study was designed to have >80% power to detect a 60%
improvement in LSS from placebo at Week 2. The power cal-
culations were based on a two-sided t test with a standard de-
viation (SD) of 0.84, placebo mean score of 6.3, statistical
significance level of 5%, and six subjects on bimekizumab
and 10 subjects on placebo.
Demographic, safety, PK and clinical features of plaque
psoriasis were summarized descriptively by treatment group
and visit. Descriptive statistics on continuous data included
arithmetic means, geometric means (where appropriate), me-
dians, SDs and ranges. Categorical data were summarized
using frequency counts and percentages.
PK parameters were calculated via noncompartmental
analysis
methods
from
the
concentration-time
data.
Immunogenicity was assessed using the validated method
QBR113786 (LGC Limited, UK) to quantify anti-bimekizumab
antibodies, with a screening cut-off point of 290 ng ml–1.
The LSS at Week 2 was treated as a continuous variable
and was analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
with baseline value (predose) as a covariate and dose as a fixed
effect. Estimated means, differences from placebo and 95%
confidence intervals were presented by dose.

verse event
S. Glatt et al.
994
Br J Clin Pharmacol (2017) 83 991–1001
 Additionally, a Bayesian analysis of LSS and PASI scores at
Week 2 was performed to support internal decision making
for bimekizumab and the model was similar to the ANCOVA
described above. Vague normal prior distributions were used
for these analyses. From the posterior distributions of the
model parameters, the posterior mean, 95% credible interval
and posterior probability of the treatment effect exceeding
certain prespecified thresholds were reported. The results of
the Bayesian analyses only are reported in the subsequent
section, which were consistent with the ANCOVA results.
A decision was made a-priori to not use P-values and so
they are not reported here. Statistical confidence in the treat-
ment effect was based on confidence/credible intervals and
posterior probabilities. There was no imputation of missing
data, nor correction for multiple comparisons.
Results
Subject disposition is summarized in Figure 1. Of the 234
subjects screened for study inclusion, 195 (83.3%) failed
screening; 39 (comprising the full analysis set [FAS] and PK -
per-protocol
set)
were
randomized
to
treatment
(bimekizumab, n = 26; placebo, n = 13). A total of 37 subjects
completed the study; two were withdrawn (one each from the
bimekizumab 8 mg group and 480 mg group, neither because
of an AE). No subjects received concomitant medication for
psoriasis during the study.
Subject demography and disease characteristics
A summary of subject demographics at baseline is shown in
Table 1. The majority of subjects were male (76.9%) and
Caucasian (94.9%), and mean age was 39.53 years (range:
21.4–65.0 years). The median PASI score for the study popula-
tion at baseline was 3.50 (range 0.8–6.7), corresponding to
PASI scores for a population with mild psoriasis. The first sub-
ject was enrolled on 22nd November 2012; the last subject
completed the study protocol on 13th January 2014.
Safety
Bimekizumab was tolerated across the dose range assessed.
Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) are reported in Table 2.
Subjects in both bimekizumab and placebo groups experi-
enced TEAEs (84.6% vs. 76.9%, respectively). The majority of
TEAEs were of mild intensity (bimekizumab, 61.5%; placebo,
53.8%). Commonly reported TEAEs occurring in ≥10% of all
subjects receiving bimekizumab were headache (n = 6 subjects;
23.1%),
oropharyngeal
pain
(n
=
5
subjects;
19.2%),
nasopharyngitis (n = 4 subjects; 15.4%) and medical device
(ECG) site reaction (n = 3 subjects; 11.5%; data not shown).
Treatment-related TEAEs were reported in 12 (46.2%) and
4 (30.8%) subjects in the bimekizumab and placebo groups,

 respectively. One serious AE of vomiting (moderate inten-
sity), occurring 37 days after dosing, was experienced by a
subject receiving 40 mg bimekizumab; this was considered
not related to the study medication. No study discontinua-
tions due to TEAEs, severe TEAEs or deaths were reported dur-
ing this study. No infusion-site reactions were reported. Mean
neutrophil counts were similar between treatment groups
(Figure 2), and no subject experienced clinically meaningful
changes in neutrophil count.
No notable differences in mean values, or consistent or
clinically meaningful changes from baseline, for any labora-
tory parameters were reported. There were no reports of clin-
ically meaningful ECG changes or physical examination
abnormalities during the study. Overall, there were no consis-
tent or clinically meaningful changes from baseline in vital
signs observed during the study.
PK
The PK of bimekizumab increased with dose in a linear fash-
ion
(Figure
3).
Following
the
end
of
drug
infusion,
bimekizumab exhibited a biphasic disposition and a linear
elimination across the dose range evaluated.
PK parameters are summarized in Table 3. Moderate-to-
high interindividual variability for the area under the curve
(AUC; geometric coefficient of variation [%] range: 22.0–
64.1%) was observed in the bimekizumab dose groups. Geo-
metric mean (GeoMean) half-life ranged from 17 days
(bimekizumab 40 mg) to 22 days (bimekizumab 160 mg)
across the treatment groups. GeoMean volume of distribution
in terminal phase ranged from 4.25 l (480 mg group) to 5.82 l
(8 mg group). GeoMean of total body clearance ranged from
0.15 l day–1 (480 mg group) to 0.19 l day–1 (8 mg group).
GeoMean AUC0–∞ increased in proportion with increasing
doses of bimekizumab (Figure 4), as did Cmax (data not shown).
Immunogenicity
Anti-bimekizumab antibodies were detected and confirmed
in one subject predose (160 mg treatment group), and five
subjects at the SFU visit (Week 20; two subjects in the 8 mg
group, two subjects in the 40 mg group, and one subject in
the 160 mg group). There was no effect of anti-bimekizumab
antibodies on PK parameters (data not shown).
Effects on clinical features of plaque psoriasis
After administration, bimekizumab produced dose-depen-
dent improvements across the evaluated clinical features of
plaque psoriasis, LSS, PASI and PGA (Figure 5). The 95%

LSS.
A
fast
onset
of
response
was
observed
with
a
mean reduction of >80% from baseline LSS in the top
two dose groups at study Week 2. At this time point, in the
40–640 mg treatment groups, it was estimated from the
Bayesian analysis that the probability of achieving >0%
improvement in LSS over placebo was >99%; in the top two
treatment groups, probability of ≥60% improvement versus
placebo was >90%. The magnitude of response was reflected
by a maximal reduction in mean change from baseline in
LSS of >90% in the 160 mg group. This was achieved by
Week 8 and was maintained to Week 16. In the 480 mg
group
a
maximal
magnitude
of
response,
100%,
was
achieved
as
early
as
Week 4.
The
response was
also
maintained to Week 16. In the 640 mg group, the maximal
reduction
(100%)
was
achieved
by
Week
8
and
was maintained between Weeks 12 and 20 (Figure 5A).
In
addition
to
the
640
mg
dose
group,
no
overlap
in CIs between the other bimekizumab treatment groups
(40–480 mg) at Week 2 vs. placebo was observed, indicating
a difference between the two groups. Similar results were
obtained for the area under the effect curve (Weeks 0–4,
[AUEC0-4w]) variable (data not shown).
P
ASI score.
A fast onset of response was observed with a mean
reduction of >65% from baseline PASI scores in the top two
treatment groups at Week 2. Bayesian analysis revealed that
the
posterior
probability
of
≥60%
improvement
over
placebo at this time point was >80%. For the bimekizumab
160 mg treatment group, the magnitude of response was
reflected by a maximal reduction in the mean change from
baseline in PASI score of >85% achieved by Week 6. This
response was maintained to study Week 12. In the 480 mg
and 640 mg treatment groups, a maximal magnitude of
response of ≥94% was observed. This was achieved by Week
6 in the 480 mg group and Week 4 in the 640 mg group. In
both groups the response was maintained to Week 12
(Figure 5B). Additionally, for bimekizumab 40–640 mg
treatment groups at Week 2, the posterior probability of
a >0% improvement in PASI score over placebo was >99%.
PGA.
A mean reduction of >50% from baseline in PGA was
observed at the highest doses of bimekizumab (480 mg and
640 mg) assessed. Maximal reductions in mean change from
baseline in PGA scores of >75% were observed in the
bimekizumab 160 mg group. This reduction was achieved
by Week 6 and was maintained to Week 12. Maximal
reductions in mean change from baseline in PGA scores
were 100% and 94%, respectively for bimekizumab 480 mg
and
640
mg
treatment
groups
(Figure
5C).
These
reductions were achieved by Week 8 and were maintained
to Week 12 in the 480 mg group, and achieved by Week 4
and maintained to Week 12 in the 640 mg group.
Discussion
This is the first time that safety, tolerability and clinical effi-
cacy of a dual IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor have been demon-
strated in subjects with mild psoriasis.
Bimekizumab, administered by intravenous infusion in a
single ascending dose, was tolerated across the dose range
assessed (≤640 mg); no safety concerns were identified in this
study. The most frequently reported TEAE was headache and
only one serious AE (vomiting of moderate intensity) was
reported, but it was not considered related to the study
treatment. Furthermore, no subject experienced clinically
meaningful changes in neutrophil count and no infusion-site
reactions
occurred
during
the
study.
Importantly,
the
specific dual inhibition of IL-17A and IL-17F by bimekizumab
is
achieved
without
interacting
with
the
IL-17RA
receptor, which also binds IL-25. As such, by sparing IL-25
in tissues, bimekizumab may reduce the potential for proin-
flammatory consequences that could result from interfering
with the IL-25 signalling pathway.
Bimekizumab demonstrated linear and dose-proportional
PK and a typical half-life ranging from 17–26 days. The
moderate-to-high interindividual variability for AUC in the
bimekizumab treatment groups is likely to be due to the small
number of subjects in the study. Estimated values for volume
of distribution in terminal phase were similar to predicted to-
tal blood volume distribution, suggesting that distribution of
bimekizumab was restricted to the extravascular compart-
ment with limited distribution to peripheral tissues, as ex-
pected
for
a
biological
agent.
The
presence
of
anti-
bimekizumab antibodies in six subjects with mild psoriasis
did not have a negative impact on PK or clinical outcomes.
The single-dose nature of this study should be considered
when discussing development of anti-bimekizumab antibod-
ies and any potential effect on clinical outcomes; this topic
may be further explored in multiple-dose studies.
All indicators of disease activity measured at baseline were
consistent with those expected in subjects with mild psoria-
sis. Bimekizumab-treated subjects achieved a fast onset

netic profile

 response, observed from study Week 2. Responses reached a
maximal magnitude (75–100% reduction in disease activity
scores) as early as Week 4. Responses were also maintained
up to Weeks 12–20 for 160–640 mg groups, in all measures
of disease activity compared with the placebo group, as
demonstrated by reductions in LSS, PASI scores and PGA.
Observed clinical efficacy appeared to increase with increas-
ing doses of bimekizumab. These data are consistent with
the hypothesis that inhibition of both IL-17A and IL-17F will
lead to significant clinical outcomes in moderate to severe
psoriasis and requires larger clinical studies in moderate to se-
vere psoriasis patients to confirm this hypothesis and to ex-
plore further dosage regimes.
Conclusion
This is the first demonstration of safety, tolerability and clini-
cal efficacy using a dual inhibitor of IL-17A and IL-17F in
subjects with mild psoriasis. Subjects receiving bimekizumab
achieved fast onset of clinically-meaningful efficacy from
Week 2. A maximal magnitude of response was observed as
early as Week 4 that was maintained up to Weeks 12–20, in
all clinical features of plaque psoriasis. These findings support
the continued clinical development of bimekizumab for dis-
eases mediated by both IL-17A and IL-17F, including psoriasis.
