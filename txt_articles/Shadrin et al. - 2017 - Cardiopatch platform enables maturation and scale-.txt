Despite increased use of human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes
(hiPSC-CMs) for drug development and disease modeling studies, methods to generate large,
functional heart tissues for human therapy are lacking. Here we present a “Cardiopatch”
platform for 3D culture and maturation of hiPSC-CMs that after 5 weeks of differentiation
show robust electromechanical coupling, consistent H-zones, I-bands, and evidence for
T-tubules and M-bands. Cardiopatch maturation markers and functional output increase
during culture, approaching values of adult myocardium. Cardiopatches can be scaled up to
clinically relevant dimensions, while preserving spatially uniform properties with high
conduction velocities and contractile stresses. Within window chambers in nude mice,
cardiopatches undergo vascularization by host vessels and continue to fire Ca2+ transients.
When implanted onto rat hearts, cardiopatches robustly engraft, maintain pre-implantation
electrical function, and do not increase the incidence of arrhythmias. These studies provide
enabling technology for future use of hiPSC-CM tissues in human heart repair.

ardiomyocytes (CMs) derived from human embryonic and
induced pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-CMs) represent an
attractive cell source for drug development and regen-
erative therapy applications. Given that as many as 1 billion CMs
can be lost during human heart attack, significant advancements
in cell differentiation, purification, and cryopreservation have
been made to enable production of large numbers of highly
pure hPSC-CMs1–4. These advances offer therapeutic promise,
especially when combined with tissue engineering strategies to
accelerate hPSC-CM maturation in vitro and to enhance survival,
retention, and functional benefits of implanted cells in vivo5.
Previously, 3D human cardiac tissues have been engineered
using scaffold-free cell sheets, synthetic polymer scaffolds, various
hydrogels (including collagen, fibrin, and cardiac-derived matrix),
and decellularized tissues6. Even with the use of electrical and
mechanical stimulation, these tissues exhibit function and
maturity far inferior to those of adult myocardium, as evidenced
by small hPSC-CM size, underdeveloped Ca2+ handling7,8, lack of
T-tubules9,10, absence of H-zones and M-bands9–12, weak excit-
ability and contractility7,8,12–18, and slow action potential con-
duction10,13,17,19–21.
Importantly, while recent focus has been on cardiac tissue
miniaturization
for
high-throughput
drug
screening7,8,12,20,
no methods have been developed to generate large, functional
heart tissues that would meet the “safety and efficacy” require-
ments
for
human
cardiac
repair.
At
a
minimum,
such
tissues should: (1) support fast action potential conduction to
reduce risk of arrhythmias22, (2) produce strong contractile forces
to aid in mechanical pumping of native heart, (3) be sufficiently
large to cover entire infarcted area, and (4) undergo vascular-
ization to promote long-term survival. Thus, there is an
immediate need for development of simple, scalable technologies
to rapidly engineer highly functional human heart tissues suitable
for
large
animal
pre-clinical
studies
and
future
clinical
applications.
We have recently described use of free-floating dynamic
culture conditions to generate miniature, cylindrically shaped
heart tissues (cardiobundles) that exhibited near-adult levels of
maturation and function23. In the current study, we combined
our hydrogel-molding methods24–26 with dynamic culture to
develop a versatile in vitro platform for rapid maturation of
3D engineered human heart tissues (cardiopatches) without need
for exogenous stimulation. Using multiple hPSC lines, we
show that cardiopatches
exhibit
electrical and
mechanical
function similar to those of the adult human myocardium.
Furthermore, the scalability of the approach is demonstrated
by the first-time engineering of cardiopatches with a clinically
relevant size (4 × 4 cm), which maintain maturation and func-
tional properties. The cardiopatches also undergo vascularization
and maintain electrical function when implanted in dorsal win-
dow chambers in nude mice and on the rat epicardium, and show
no arrhythmogenesis in vitro or in vivo. Together, our studies
suggest the utility of the cardiopatch platform for the future
development of next-generation tissue engineering therapies for
ischemic heart disease.
Results
Cellular makeup and structural maturation of cardiopatches.
Through modification of the WNT signaling pathway1,2, we
differentiated hiPSC monolayers into hiPSC-CMs, with the onset
of spontaneous contractions typically between d7 and d9. Fol-
lowing two days of metabolic selection4 (d10–12) and replating to
eliminate non-CMs (Supplementary Movie 1), cells at d15–21
contained 86.3 ± 0.9% cTnT+ hiPSC-CMs (n = 66 independent
differentiations; range 71–98% cTnT + ; Fig. 1a), with the
remaining ~14% made up primarily of smooth muscle cells and
fibroblasts and virtually no endothelial cells (Supplementary
Fig. 2). The dissociated cells were encapsulated in hydrogel to
form 7 × 7 mm cardiopatches (1 × 106 cells per patch, Fig. 1b,
Supplementary Fig. 1). After 3 weeks of free-floating dynamic
culture23, cardiopatches consisted of densely packed, multi-
layered sarcomeric α-actinin (SAA)+ CMs surrounded by a layer
of vimentin+ fibroblasts (Fig. 1c) and SM22a+ smooth muscle
cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A, upper) and lacked CD31+ endo-
thelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A, lower). Cardiomyocytes
within cardiopatches exhibited organized cross-striations and
abundant Connexin-43+ gap junctions (Fig. 1d) and N-Cadherin+
adherens junctions (Fig. 1e). Use of Nkx2.5 to specifically label
cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Fig. 4) and Ki67 as a marker of
cell proliferation demonstrated a continuous decrease in Ki67+
CMs from 17.0 ± 0.7% at 1 week to 8.1 ± 1.1% at 3 weeks of
culture, consistent with a progressive exit from the cell cycle
typical of cardiac maturation and development27. We further
immunostained for ventricular (MLC2v) and atrial (MLC2a)
isoforms of myosin light chain, the latter of which is expressed in
both atrial and immature ventricular myocytes and lost in ven-
tricular myocytes with maturation28. With time of culture, per-
cent of dual positive MLC2a + 2v immature CMs was gradually
decreased, with MLC2v single-positive CMs reaching 94% by
3 weeks of culture. Together, these data indicated progressive
maturation of hiPSC-CMs within cardiopatches and their pre-
dominant ventricular specification.
Functional
maturation
of
cardiopatches.
Cardiopatches
exhibited spontaneous macroscopic contractions (Supplementary
Movie 2) with rate that gradually decreased from 90 to 120 bpm
at 1 week to 30–60 bpm at 3 weeks of culture (Fig. 2a). Simul-
taneously, the total and specific active forces of contraction
increased from 1.2 ± 0.3 mN (2.9 ± 0.6 mN/mm2) at 1 week to
3.9 ± 0.2 mN (13.3 ± 1.0 mN/mm2) at 3 weeks of culture (Fig. 2a,
b), with cardiopatches exhibiting physiological active and passive
force–length relationships (Fig. 2c). Passive tension increased
with tissue stretch and time of culture, reaching 1.8 ± 0.1 mN
at 20% stretch (Fig. 2c). At 3 weeks of culture, passive stiffnes-
s of cardiopatches (26 ± 5.6 kPa) approximated diastolic cross-
fiber stiffness of adult human ventricles (~20–50 kPa29,30).
Moreover, cardiopatches demonstrated flat to slightly negative
active force–frequency relationships (FFRs) with 95 ± 0.8% and
83 ± 2.0% of 1 Hz force maintained at 1.5 and 2 Hz stimulation,
respectively, (Supplementary Fig. 5A, B). Interestingly, the FFR
slopes
were
higher
in
cardiopatches
with
shorter
1 Hz
twitch duration (Supplementary Fig. 5C) and, specifically, in
those having shorter 1 Hz twitch relaxation (Supplementary
Fig. 5D) but not rise (Supplementary Fig. 5E) times. Furthermore,
electrophysiological assessment by optical mapping demonstrated
uniform
action
potential
propagation
with
conduction
velocity (CV) that increased over 3 weeks of culture (Fig. 2d),
reaching values of 25.1 ± 1.3 cm/s (Fig. 2e, Supplementary
Movie 3), consistent with the increased expression of Cx43+
gap junctions (Supplementary Fig. 3B). Importantly, similar
functional properties (±20%) were obtained in cardiopatches
made from three additional hESC lines (HES2, H9, and RUES2),
indicating high reproducibility of the methodology (Fig. 2f).
We further optimized cardiopatch maturation and function by
varying time of switch from early CM differentiation media
(RPMI/B27 + insulin, termed 3D RB+, Supplementary Table 1) to
our standard 3D culture media (5% FBS, Supplementary Table 1)
24. Interestingly, cardiopatches that were switched earlier from 3D
RB+ to 5% FBS media, exhibited lower active and specific forces
(Fig. 2g, h), but higher CVs (Fig. 2i), which were consistent with

 an apparent increase in their Cx43 expression (Supplementary
Fig. 6A). Simultaneously, use of 5% FBS media for 1, 2, or 3 weeks
promoted localization of N-Cadherin to cell–cell boundaries
(Supplementary Fig. 6B), prolonged action potential duration
(APD, Fig. 2j), and increased non-myocyte coverage at cardio-
patch periphery (Supplementary Fig. 6C). Based on these results,
for the remainder of the studies we chose an optimal media
condition (1 week 3D RB+, 2 weeks 5% FBS) that produced
cardiopatches
with
both
high
active
forces
(4.7 ± 0.3 mN,
15.2 ± 0.9 mN/mm2) and fast CVs (25.8 ± 0.8 cm/s).
Enhanced hiPSC-CM properties in low-density cardiopatches.
To provide more room for cell growth and improve the func-
tional output of hiPSC-CMs, we generated cardiopatches with 0.5
million myocytes (0.5MM), half the original cell density. These
tissues contained 23% fewer cells per field of view (176.5 ± 10.4
vs. 229.4 ± 16.2 cells; Fig. 3a, b) and were on average 29% thinner
(33.4 ± 1.5 vs. 47.4 ± 2.2 μm, Fig. 3c, d) than 1MM patches. The
relative cell counts estimated from cardiopatch thickness multi-
plied by cells per field of view indicated that 0.5MM cardio-
patches contained 54% of cells present in 1MM cardiopatches
(Fig. 3e), implying preserved input cell ratio after 3 weeks of
culture. Furthermore, the relative cell numbers and volumes of
0.5 vs. 1MM tissues (54% of cells in 71% volume) suggested that
the cell size in 0.5MM cardiopatches was increased by ~30% in
0.5MM patches. Similar to 1MM cardiopatches, hiPSC-CMs in
0.5MM patches exhibited highly organized sarcomeres and robust
electromechanical coupling (Fig. 3f) across entire thickness of the
tissue (Supplementary Movie 4), with N-cadherin junctions
appearing to localize at cell ends (Fig. 3f, left). Consistent with
normal postnatal heart development31, the Cx43 distribution
lagged behind observed N-cadherin polarization, remaining uni-
form (Fig. 3f, right) and most resembling gap junctional dis-
tribution seen in 1–5-year-old human hearts31. In addition to
cross-striated distribution of cardiac troponin T (cTnT, Supple-
mentary Fig. 7A), strong expression of mature cardiac troponin I
(cTnI) (Supplementary Fig. 7B), known to replace immature
slow-skeletal TnI (ssTnI) during cardiac development32, further
indicated advanced structural maturation of hiPSC-CMs.
From
a
functional
standpoint,
0.5MM
cardiopatches
produced 88% of the active force of 1MM patches (5.2 ± 0.2 vs.
5.8 ± 0.2 mN; Fig. 3g), but given their smaller cross-sectional
area, yielded significantly higher specific forces (22.4 ± 0.9 vs.
17.7 ± 0.7 mN/mm2; Fig. 3g). Several cardiopatches exhibited
active forces >7 mN and stresses >30 mN/mm2 (Supplementary
Fig. 8A, Fig. 3g) that were in the range of the 25–44 mN/mm2
values measured for adult human myocardium33,34. Furthermore,
contractile force production per input CM24 was nearly two-fold
higher in 0.5MM cardiopatches (11.9 ± 0.5 vs. 6.7 ± 0.3 nN per
cell; Fig. 3g), while twitch kinetics were significantly faster (rise
time of 98.0 ± 2.2 vs. 107.6 ± 2.4 ms; Supplementary Fig. 9A–C),
suggesting a more mature contractile apparatus. Consistent
with
these
findings,
0.5MM
cardiopatches
also
showed
increased velocity of action potential propagation (28.5 ± 1.0 vs.
25.2 ± 1.1 cm/s, Fig. 3h), with multiple patches having CVs over
40 cm/s (Supplementary Fig. 8B, Fig. 3h), i.e., comparable to an
average CV of 46.4 cm/s recorded in adult human ventricles35.

 and decreased Cx43 expression (Supplementary Fig. 10E),
resembling the appearance of 1-week dynamically cultured
tissues. Thus, in agreement with our recent study23, dynamic
culture was essential for promoting the advanced functional
phenotype of cardiopatches.
Molecular and ultrastructural maturation of hiPSC-CMs. We
further sought to reveal the molecular and ultrastructural sig-
natures underlying advanced functional maturation of 0.5MM
cardiopatches.
Based
on
previous
studies
comparing
gene
expression patterns among hPSC-CMs, fetal and adult human
myocardium, we identified a panel of 10 cardiac “maturation
genes” (Supplementary Tables 3 and 4) with the highest adult:fetal
(up to 14-fold) and adult:hPSC-CM (up to 797-fold) expression
ratios. These 10 genes were classified into three groups—struc-
tural (TNNI3, MYL2, MYOM2, MYOM3), excitation–contraction
(E–C) coupling (CASQ2, S100A1, PLN), and metabolic (COX6A2,
CKMT2, CKM), thus reflecting key maturation processes in
developing CMs. Nine out of the ten genes were found to pro-
gressively increase with time of culture, while phospholamban
(PLN, previously shown lacking expression in hiPSC-CMs37)
remained steady at high level (55–70% of adult heart levels)
(Fig. 4a) between culture weeks 1 and 3. Importantly, gene
expression
at
3
weeks
of
culture
was

higher (median 23-fold) compared to d0, including a 108-fold

 increase in the expression of 9 out of 10 maturation genes
(with 10-fold higher MYOM2 expression) was found compared
to age-matched monolayers (Supplementary Fig. 11B), while
significantly higher expression of MYOM3, CASQ2, S100A1,
and COX6A2 (encompassing genes from each all three matura-
tion categories) was found compared to 1MM patches (Fig. 4b).
Consistent with the morphometric analysis, additional indices
of cell size, such as the total protein per DNA (Fig. 4c) and
the
total
GAPDH
protein
per
nuclear
envelope
protein
LamB1 (Fig. 4d, e, Supplementary Fig. 19A), were 13 and 33%
higher
in
0.5MM
than
1MM
cardiopatches,
respectively,
providing further evidence for increased CM size in less dense
tissues. Moreover, higher expression of phosphorylated Akt,
with minimal changes in mTOR and AMPK phosphorylation
(Supplementary Figs. 12 and 19B), suggested Akt-mediated sig-
naling as a mechanism for the increased CM size in 0.5MM
patches. Along with the observed gene expression changes and
CM hypertrophy, 1.7, 1.4, and 1.3-fold higher expression of SAA,
βMHC, and Cx43 proteins, respectively (Fig. 4d, e, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 19A), further supported the finding of enhanced CM
maturation in 0.5MM vs. 1MM cardiopatches.
At the ultrastructural level, hiPSC-CMs in 3 week 0.5MM
cardiopatches exhibited highly regular and organized sarcomeres
(Fig. 4f, Supplementary Fig. 13A) with prominent central H-
zones and two distinct I-bands adjacent to Z-discs (0.88 ± 0.07 H-
zones, 1.85 ± 0.08 I-bands per sarcomere; Fig. 4g, h), more
frequently
than
in
other
engineered
human
cardiac
tissues9,11–13,38 and approaching the reproducible Z-I-H-I-Z
pattern seen in adult human cardiomyocytes39. Consistent with
functional results, adjacent cardiomyocytes were interconnected
via desmosomes and gap junctions (Supplementary Fig. 13B),
while internal myofibrils were surrounded by abundant mito-
chondria with well-developed cristae (Fig. 4i). Notably, some cells
(<5%) demonstrated clear M-bands in the center of the H-zones
(Fig. 4j), a hallmark of mature sarcomeres that in hiPSC-CM
monolayers was previously seen only after 360 days of culture40.
A fraction of the hiPSC-CMs (<5%) also exhibited T-tubule-like
structures
adjacent
to
Z-discs
(Fig.
4k),
with
additional
evidence for T-tubulogenesis coming from upregulated expres-
sion of T-tubule-associated proteins41,42 Caveolin-3 (Cav3) and
Junctophilin-2 (JPH2, Supplementary Figs. 14A, B and 19C) and
Cav3 accumulation observed in sarcomeres (Supplementary
Fig. 14C). While live membrane staining with Di-8-ANEPPS
(Supplementary Fig. 14D) did not reveal cross-striated T-tubular
pattern characteristic of adult cardiomyocytes, these results
supported significant maturation of the E–C coupling machinery
during 3-week cardiopatch culture. Taken together, these data
showed that lowering cell density in cardiopatches promoted
hiPSC-CM hypertrophy, molecular and ultrastructural matura-
tion to approximate several features of adult myocardium.
Scale-up of cardiopatch size. Having established a robust 3D
culture system for maturation of hiPSC-CMs, we asked whether

 the 0.5MM 7 × 7 mm cardiopatches could be scaled up to a
clinically relevant area without loss of advanced electrical and
mechanical function. We thus modified our hydrogel engineering
approach to generate 15 × 15 mm (Mega) and 36 × 36 mm (Giga)
cardiopatches using 2 and 10 million CMs, respectively (Fig. 5a,
Supplementary Fig. 15). After 3 weeks of free-floating dynamic
culture (Supplementary Movie 5), scaled up cardiopatches
exhibited spontaneous, synchronous contractions (~30–60 bpm)
that could be overridden by higher rate electrical pacing (Sup-
plementary Movie 6). Similar to control 7 × 7 mm constructs
(Figs. 1D and 3F), Giga cardiopatches were 34.8 ± 1.8 µm thick
(Fig. 5b) and densely populated by cross-striated and robustly
coupled hiPSC-CMs (Fig. 5c). Despite significant scale-up in
size, both Mega and Giga cardiopatches exhibited similar CVs
(Mega 27.2 ± 1.1 cm/s, Giga 28.9 ± 1.8 cm/s) and APDs (Mega
447 ± 22 ms, Giga 471 ± 31 ms) to those of control constructs
(Fig. 5e, f), indicating preservation of electrical phenotype. In
addition, scaled-up cardiopatches supported spatially uniform
action potential propagation throughout the entire area (Fig. 5d,

 arrhythmias during burst pacing. Twitch forces in cardiopatches
increased with increase in tissue size, averaging for this set of
experiments to 4.6 ± 0.6, 9.4 ± 1.0 to 17.5 ± 1.1 mN for control,
Mega and Giga patches, respectively (reaching >20 mN in Giga
cardiopatches, Fig. 5g), with specific forces that were similar for
all
groups
(19.2 ± 2.2,
19.4 ± 2.1,
and
17.0 ± 0.8 mN/mm2,
respectively). Similarly, for cardiopatches derived from the same
input cells, relative increase in twitch force with tissue scale-up
(Fig. 5h) yielded comparable specific forces (Fig. 5i), indicating
successful
preservation
of
cardiopatch
contractile
strength.
Together, these results demonstrated the first-time engineering of
large,
highly
functional,
non-arrhythmogenic
human
heart
tissues.
Cardiopatch vascularization and function in window cham-
bers. We then assessed the ability of cardiopatches to vascularize
and remain functional in vivo using our previously described
dorsal window chamber assay in nude mice43,44. The 3-week-old
0.5MM cardiopatches (7 × 7 mm) were implanted into dorsal
window chambers and imaged through a glass coverslip overlying
the implant (Fig. 6a). Analysis of intravital images (Fig. 6b,
Supplementary Fig. 17) demonstrated progressive implant vas-
cularization with a 1.6-fold increase in blood vessel density (BVD,
Fig. 6c) between 7 and 14 days post implantation, significantly
more compared to cell-free, frame-only controls (Fig. 6c). By
2 weeks post implantation, blood flow through the newly formed
vessels was clearly visible (Supplementary Movie 8), while cross-
sectional stainings revealed intact cTnT+ cardiopatches (Fig. 6d)
containing CD31+ capillary lumens and Cx43-coupled striated
cardiomyocytes (Fig. 6e, f). Considering that implanted patches
contained no endothelial cells (Supplementary Fig. 3A, lower),
observed vascularization in vivo likely originated from the host
vessel ingrowth. To assess cardiopatch functionality in vivo,
hiPSC-CMs were transduced with an MHCK7-gCaMP6 lenti-
virus45 and spontaneous Ca2+ transients were intravitally mon-
itored through the chamber window. Implanted cardiopatches
demonstrated strong, synchronous Ca2+ flashes (Fig. 6g, Sup-
plementary Movie 9) with amplitudes (dF/F) that remained stable
during 2 week period (Fig. 6h). Overall, these results indicated
that in vitro engineered avascular cardiopatches can undergo
progressive vascularization and maintain functionality in vivo.
Functional analysis of epicardially implanted cardiopatches. To
further validate the findings from the dorsal window chambers in
a more relevant implantation environment and support transla-
tional prospects of our approach, 2-week-old 0.5 MM cardio-
patches (7 × 7 mm) were implanted onto the nude rat epicardium
and assessed 3 weeks post implantation (Fig. 7a). Upon extraction
and Langendorff perfusion of patch-implanted hearts, 10 of 11
cardiopatches exhibited spontaneous and exogenously stimulated
(1–2.5 Hz) gCaMP6-reported Ca2+ transients (Fig. 7b), indicating
successful engraftment and survival. Dual camera mapping
(Fig. 7c) of electrical activity in the heart (Di-4-ANEPPS) and
cardiopatch (gCaMP6) showed no evidence of graft-host func-
tional coupling since spontaneous or pacing-induced (remote
from the cardiopatch) activation in epicardium did not yield Ca2+
transients in the patch (Fig. 7d, Supplementary Movie 10). On the
other
hand,
simultaneous
stimulation
of
cardiopatch
and
underlying epicardium by a point electrode placed near the car-
diopatch frame induced electrical propagation in both the patch
and the heart (Fig. 7d, e; Supplementary Movie 11). From these
studies, CVs in implanted cardiopatches (18.1 ± 1.7 cm/s, Fig. 7e,
right) were found to be comparable to pre-implantation CVs
(19.3 ± 1.0 cm/s), indicating preserved patch structure and elec-
trical function in the epicardial environment. Furthermore,
cardiopatches did not disturb the propagation pattern of under-
lying epicardium (Fig. 7e, left), its CV or APD (Fig. 7f), suggesting
no adverse paracrine effects from the grafted cells. Consistent
with functional results, immunohistological assessment (Fig. 7g)
confirmed robust epicardial engraftment of cardiopatches, which
contained densely packed cardiomyocytes labeled by SAA and
human nuclear antigen (HNA, Fig. 7g, left) and interconnected
via Cx43 gap junctions (Fig. 7h). As expected from the lack of
electrical coupling, cardiopatches were insulated from the host
epicardium by a ~200–300 μm layer of non-cardiac tissue. Similar
to window chamber results, host blood vessels were found
ingrown in the implanted cardiopatches and between the patch
and host myocardium (Fig. 7g, arrows, right).
While the hearts with cardiopatches retained normal CVs and
APDs, suggesting no adverse effects on host electrical function,
we employed programmed electrical stimulation, ECG record-
ings, and optical mapping to systematically assess vulnerability to
arrhythmias of the patch-implanted vs. control (non-operated,
age-matched) hearts (n = 6 for each). In 75% of attempts, burst
pacing at 2–20 Hz (Supplementary Fig. 18A) failed to produce
arrhythmias in both patch-implanted (40/54 attempts) and
control (36/48 attempts) hearts; instead, hearts returned after
pacing to a sinus rhythm that typically manifested as epicardial
breakthroughs in ventricles (Supplementary Fig. 18C, top;
Supplementary Movie 11). In the remaining attempts, burst
pacing induced unsustained arrhythmias of different durations
typically
caused
by
one
or
two
propagating
waves
(and
occasionally a distinct reentrant circuit observed in the field of
view, Supplementary Fig. 18C, middle; Supplementary Movie 11)
that self-terminated after a short period. Two control (but none of
patch-implanted)
hearts
also
exhibited
sustained
(>1 min)
arrhythmias caused by a more complex, multi-wave activity
(Supplementary Fig. 18C, bottom; Supplementary Movie 11).
Overall, histogram analysis (Supplementary Fig. 18D) showed
similar frequencies of arrhythmic events in the two groups, with a
slightly higher number of shorter episodes induced in patch-
implanted hearts and longer episodes induced in control hearts.
Together, these results indicated that after 3 weeks in vivo,
epicardially implanted cardiopatches exhibited robust survival
and vascularization, maintained electrical function at pre-
implantation levels, lacked electrical integration with the host
rat heart, and exerted no adverse effects on host electrical
properties or vulnerability to arrhythmias.
Discussion
Compared to cell injection strategies currently tested in clinics,
implantation of in vitro engineered functional cardiac tissues
could offer several benefits, such as greatly improved survival,
retention, and paracrine action of implanted cells at the infarct
site, added structural support, and antiarrhythmic effects from
full-length coverage of the scar with electrically conducting tissue.
While significant progress has been made in generating miniature
heart tissue surrogates for drug testing7,8,12,20, clinical translation
of cardiac tissue engineering has faced several challenges,
including: (1) inadequate cardiomyocyte maturation, (2) small
tissue surface area, (3) small tissue thickness (no perfusable vas-
culature), and (4) lack of electromechanical integration between
implanted and host tissue. In this study, we sought to address the
first two challenges by establishing a platform for engineering
highly mature and functional human heart tissues (cardiopatches)
with a clinically relevant area (4 × 4 cm). This method is rapid
(5 weeks from pluripotent state), reproducible across multiple
hPSC lines, and does not require the use of electrical or
mechanical stimulation, perfusion bioreactors, or other condi-
tions that would complicate future clinical translation. Rather, we

 utilized a free-floating dynamic culture to enhance nutrient
availability23, flexible frames to support auxotonic tissue loading,
and optimized culture media and cell seeding density to develop a
highly efficient in vitro cardiac maturation system.
Human cardiopatches engineered on this platform had func-
tional outputs approaching those of adult human myocardium,
including the highest reported patch contractile forces (>5 mN
for small and >20 mN for large patches), specific forces
(>22 mN/mm2), and CVs (~30 cm/s)6,12,19,46–50. Importantly,
despite significant scale-up in size, the largest engineered cardi-
opatches exhibited high CVs and uniform cell density, electrical
coupling, and propagation across the entire patch that prevented
pacing-induced arrhythmias in vitro, contrasting previous reports
in the engineered tissues with slow CVs51. As recently shown in
non-human primates22,52, large heterogeneous tissue grafts with
relatively immature PSC-CMs greatly increased the risk of cardiac
arrhythmias, further signifying the importance of engineering
spatially uniform and mature functional properties in large tissue
patches. Conceivably, the contractile force and CV of cardio-
patches could be further increased by ~1.4-fold if randomly
oriented CMs were aligned using more elaborate biofabrica-
tion53,54 or bioreactor13 approaches.
At the cellular level, the force generating capacity per input
cardiomyocyte was 8–1400-fold higher for cardiopatches than
other engineered human heart tissues6,46. This was consistent
with ubiquitously observed regular Z-I-H-I-Z-band patterns
across sarcomeres, a finding that contrasted previous studies
reporting occurrence of H-zones in fewer than a third of the
cells38 or only with high-frequency electrical stimulation21, or
irregular I-bands and absence of H-zones altogether9,11,12.
Important factors contributing to advanced CM maturation in
cardiopatches were sequential application of serum-free followed
by serum-containing media and reduced seeding density, which
increased functional gene and protein expression as well as cell
size, at least in part by upregulating Akt signaling, a known
mediator of physiological hypertrophy55. Still, some of the
advanced ultrastructural features including M-bands and T-
tubules were present in a relatively small subset of CMs, which
along with the neonatal Cx43 distribution31 and force–frequency
relationship (FFR)56 warrant future optimization to achieve a
fully mature, adult tissue phenotype. Interestingly, across differ-
ent hPSC lines and culture protocols, cardiopatches with faster
twitch relaxation exhibited more positive FFR, consistent with the
need for accelerated sarcoplasmic reticulum uptake of Ca2+ in
frequency-induced CM inotropy57. While high-frequency elec-
trical stimulation58 might improve FFR in cardiopatches, the 83%
force levels remaining at 2 Hz stimulation still significantly sur-
pass other reports in the field.
In this study, the in vivo fate of cardiopatches was investigated
using two small animal models. The dorsal window chamber
model allowed us to, for the first time, monitor survival, vascu-
larization, and function of implanted cardiac tissues in real time
in live mice. Successful vascularization and blood perfusion of
cardiopatches within 2 weeks of implantation was likely aided by
the continued metabolic demand of spontaneously contracting
cardiomyocytes59 that remained functional throughout the study.
Robust engraftment and preserved structure and electrical func-
tion of implanted cardiopatches were further confirmed using a
more clinically relevant and mechanically realistic environment of
rat ventricular epicardium. Here we for the first time employed
dual optical mapping to simultaneously, with high spatial and
temporal resolution, monitor propagation of electrical signals in
cardiopatches and recipient hearts and rigorously assess graft’s
conduction velocity and electrophysiological effects on host epi-
cardium. Compared to previous methods that utilized extra-
cellular recordings60, topical application of voltage sensitive
dyes61, or comparison of ECG and gCaMP signals22,52,62, dual
mapping allowed tracking of how grafted CMs are activated
relative to host CMs including propagation underneath the graft
and at the graft-host boundary. We found that while implanted
cardiopatches maintained pre-implantation electrical properties,
they failed to functionally couple with the recipient hearts and
were separated from the epicardium by a thin non-cardiac layer,
as observed in previous studies62,63.
Importantly, we found no adverse paracrine effects of grafted
cells on the electrical properties of underlying epicardium and
through aggressive burst pacing protocols demonstrated that
cardiopatches did not increase vulnerability to arrhythmias in
host ventricles. While applying small cardiopatches to infarcted
rodent hearts would likely confirm previously reported paracrine
benefits on contractile function18,62–64, large-animal studies are
warranted to further evaluate therapeutic safety and efficacy of
large cardiopatches towards potential clinical use. Excitingly,
Menasche et al. recently demonstrated improved cardiac function
in a 68-year-old patient with advanced heart failure following
epicardial implantation of a 20 cm2 fibrin-based tissue patch
containing hESC-derived SSEA-1+ progenitors65, providing a
foundation for future use of hPSC-based strategies in human
heart repair. Tissue patches made of functional hPSC-CMs might
further enhance therapeutic benefits, if engineered to be func-
tionally mature, thick, and able to electromechanically integrate
with host myocardium. Regardless of patch size and maturity, the
remaining challenges (namely thickness and electrical integra-
tion) will need to be addressed for the ultimate success of cardiac
tissue engineering therapies in clinics.
In conclusion, we have established a scalable methodology to
generate the first highly functional human cardiac tissues with
clinically relevant dimensions (4 × 4 cm). Together, the relative
simplicity of the approach, rapid structural and functional
maturation of tissues in vitro, and robust survival, functionality,
and vascularization in multiple small animal models provide
grounds for further development of this technology towards novel
therapies for ischemic heart disease.
Methods
Generation and maintenance of hPSCs. BJ fibroblasts from a healthy male
newborn (ATCC cell line, CRL-2522) were reprogrammed episomally into hiPSCs
at the Duke University iPSC Core Facility and named DU11 (Duke University
clone #11) following verification of pluripotency. RUES2 and H9 hESCs were
obtained from and approved for use by Rockefeller University and WiCell Institute,
respectively. Cardiomyocytes differentiated from Hes2 hESCs were obtained from
VistaGen Therapeutics. hPSCs were maintained as feeder-free cultures on growth
factor-reduced Matrigel (Corning, 80 µg/mL or 8.5–10 µg/cm2 coating) in either
TeSR-E8 or mTeSR media (Stem Cell Technologies) and passaged as small (10–20
cells) clusters every 4–5 days using 0.5 mM EDTA (1:10–1:40 split ratios) when
cells reached 75–85% confluence. With the exception of Fig. 2f, all experiments
were performed using DU11 hiPSCs between passages 18 and 45. RUES2 and H9
hESCs were used between passages 60 and 75. All cell lines were routinely tested for
Mycoplasma contamination using commercially available kits (MycoAlert, Lonza).
Cardiac differentiation of hPSCs. hPSCs were differentiated into CMs via small-
molecule-based modulation of Wnt signaling1,2. Briefly, feeder-free cultures of
RUES2, H9 hESCs, and DU11 hiPSCs were grown to 75–85% confluence and
dissociated into single cells using Accutase (Innovative Cell Technologies). We
found that cells responded differently to differentiation depending on their
maintenance culture media (E8 or mTeSR), which required adjustment of seeding
density and small molecule concentration. As such, cells were plated at either 5 ×
104/cm2 (for E8 protocol) or 2 × 105/cm2 (for mTeSR protocol) with 5 µM Y27632
(ROCK inhibitor, Tocris) and induced either 3 or 2 days after seeding, respectively.
Maintenance media was changed daily prior to differentiation. To induce cardiac
differentiation (d0), cells were treated with 8–10 μM (for E8 protocol) or 10–14 μM
(for mTeSR protocol) CHIR99021 (SelleckChem) in RPMI-1640 with B27(−)
insulin (ThermoFisher Scientific). Exactly 24 h later, CHIR was removed and
replaced with basal RPMI/B27(−) medium. On d3, half of the old medium was
collected and mixed with fresh RPMI/B27(−) medium containing 5μM (final
concentration) IWP-4 (Tocris). Gentle swirling of the plate and aspiration of dead
cells and debris prior to addition of complete medium improved cell viability. On

 d5, IWP-4 was replaced with basal RPMI/B27(−) medium. From d7 onward, cells
were fed with RPMI/B27(+)-insulin every 2–3 days, with spontaneous beating
generally starting on d7–d10 of differentiation.
Metabolic selection of hPSC-CMs. Differentiating CM cultures were purified via
metabolic selection between d10 and d12 based on previously described methods4.
Briefly, cultures were rinsed with PBS and incubated with “no glucose” medium for
48 h (glucose-free RPMI (ThermoFisher Scientific 11879020) supplemented with
4 mM lactate (Sigma L4263), 0.5 mg/mL recombinant human albumin (Sigma
A6612), and 213 μg/mL L-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Sigma A8960))3. Occasion-
ally, cultures required 1–2 days of additional selection to more efficiently eliminate
non-CMs. At the end of the selection period, cultures were dissociated into single
cells using 0.25% trypsin/EDTA followed by quenching with stop buffer (DMEM,
20% FBS, 20 μg/mL DNAse I (Millipore 260913)) and replated onto fresh Matrigel-
coated dishes to remove dead cells and debris.
Flow cytometry analysis of CM purity. Dissociated cardiomyocytes were fixed in
1% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, EMS) for 15 min at 22 °C,
and permeabilized and blocked in FACS buffer (PBS containing 5% chick serum,
0.1% Triton-X, 0.02% sodium azide) for 1 h. Cells were incubated with rabbit anti-
cTnT antibody (Supplementary Table 2) for 1 h at 4 °C, washed three times with
FACS buffer, and incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor® 488 antibody (Invitro-
gen, 1:1000) for 30 min at 22 °C in the dark. After washing, cells were strained
through a 30 μm filter and run on a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences).
Negative controls consisted of undifferentiated hPSCs stained with anti-cTnT. Live
single cells were identified and gated based on their forward and side scatter, and
cardiomyocytes were gated based on their cTnT expression. Data were analyzed
using Flowing Software.
Cardiopatch fabrication and culture. To generate 7 × 7 mm 3D human “cardio-
patches”, 9 × 9 mm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS, Dow Corning) square molds
were microfabricated as previously described26. Molds were gas-sterilized and
treated with 0.1% pluronic F-127 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for >1 h to increase
the hydrophilic nature of molds (and minimize cell attachment to PDMS) and
rinsed with water just prior to use. Nylon frames (9 × 9 mm) (Cerex Advanced
Fabrics) were laser-cut, soaked in 70% EtOH to sterilize, and allowed to dry for
>30 min prior to transfer into PDMS molds. Hydrogel solution (24 μL human
fibrinogen (10 mg/mL, Sigma F4883), 12 μL Matrigel, 24 μL 2x cardiac media
(Supplementary Table 1) was mixed with 1 × 106 (1 MM) or 0.5 × 106 (0.5 MM)
cells in 58 μL cardiac media (Supplementary Table 1). Following addition of 2.4 μL
thrombin (50 U/mL, Sigma T7513), cell/gel solution was added to molds and left at
37 °C for 1 h to polymerize (Supplementary Fig. 1). Cardiopatches were removed
from molds and cultured in 12-well plates on a rocking platform (GeneMate
Rocker, BioExpress) for 21 days in 1.5–2 mL of cardiac medium, which contained
aminocaproic acid to prevent fibrin degradation. To enhance the paracrine action
of secreted factors, 2/3 of the culture media was changed every 2 days.
To generate scaled up cardiopatches, 18 × 18 mm Mega and 41 × 41 mm Giga
Teflon masters (negative) were first designed in AutoCad (Supplementary Fig. 15A,
left column), and then cast with PDMS to make reusable, positive molds
(Supplementary Fig. 15A, middle columns). Cerex frames were laser-cut to fit
tightly into the molds. Scaled up patches are referred to by their inner frame
dimensions (15 × 15 mm for Mega, 36 × 36 mm for Giga; Supplementary Fig. 15A,
right column). Hydrogel solution was scaled-up in proportion to the surface area
(fold changes from control molds: ~3.5 for Mega, ~17 for Giga), with similar
increases in input cell numbers. Giga and Mega master molds were engineered with
12 PDMS posts (Supplementary Fig. 15A, 2nd column) to facilitate eventual
removal of the frame for implantation. At a minimum, four small corner posts were
required for Giga patches (Supplementary Fig. 15A, 3rd column; Supplementary
Fig. 15B) to secure the large Cerex frame in the mold during pipetting and
polymerization of the hydrogel mixture. Mega and Giga patches were kept in the
molds for 2–3 days to allow for sufficient compaction of the gel across the larger
area prior to removal from the molds. While Mega patches could be cultured in six-
well plates, Giga patches were cultured in custom-built high-walled PDMS
chambers (Supplementary Fig. 15C) to allow for dynamic culture without media
spillage or loss of sterility.
Assessment of electrical propagation. Optical mapping of transmembrane
potentials was performed after 1–3 weeks of culture using our established meth-
ods25,66,67. Briefly, hPSC-CM patches were incubated with a voltage-sensitive dye,
di-4-ANEPPS (15 μM, Life Technologies), in standard Tyrode’s solution (135 mM
NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgCl2, 0.33 mM NaHPO4, 5 mM
HEPES, 5 mM glucose; pH 7.4, 280 mOsm), and a bipolar platinum point-electrode
was used to stimulate (8–15 V) the corner of the patch at varying pacing rates
(1–4 Hz). Blebbistatin (5 μM, Sigma B0560) was added to inhibit contractions and
eliminate motion artifacts during recordings. Two-second episodes of electrical
activity induced by point stimulation were recorded from underneath for control
and Mega patches using a 504-channel photodiode array (RedShirt Imaging, 1mm
effective resolution, acquired at 1.2 kHz) or from above for Giga patches using a
fast EMCCD camera (iXonEM+, Andor) equipped with a 50 mm Navitar lens
(512 × 512 pixels, 80 µm resolution, acquired at 125 Hz; Supplementary Fig. 16C).
Velocity of action potential propagation (conduction velocity, CV), action potential
duration at 80% repolarization (APD), isochrone maps and movies of action
potential propagation were derived from acquired signals using our custom
MATLAB software66.
Assessment of biomechanical properties. Force generating capacity of cardiac
tissue patches was assessed in 1- to 3-week-old patches loaded into a custom-made
isometric force measurement setup containing an optical force transducer (µN-
sensitivity) and a computer-controlled linear actuator (Thorlabs), as previously
described25,67,68. To derive force–length relationships, cardiopatch frames were cut
on two of four sides and patches were progressively stretched in increments of 2%
of culture length (0.14 mm/0.3 mm/0.72 mm for control/Mega/Giga; Supplemen-
tary Fig. 16A, B) to a maximum 20% stretch, and at each length, passive tension
(non-stimulated) and active (contractile) force responses were recorded during
1 Hz field-electrode stimulation (10 ms duration, 20–30 V) applied by a Grass
stimulator (SD9, Grass Technologies). Stiffness was measured as the slope of the
passive tension curve at the highest three strain levels (112–120%) divided by the
cross-sectional area of the patch (same as the one used for calculation of specific
forces). Kinetic properties of contractile forces generation were determined by
measuring force rise time (from 10 to 90% activation), decay time (from 10 to 90%
relaxation), and total time (10% activation to 90% relaxation) with custom
MATLAB algorithms as shown previously24. Force–frequency relationship was
assessed in normal Tyrode’s solution at 112% of culture length via a 20 s recording
with step-wise increases in field-shock stimulation at 1, 1.5, and 2 Hz.
Structural characterization and immunofluorescence in vitro. Immuno-
fluorescent analysis was performed after 1–3 weeks of culture as previously
described24,25. Briefly, cardiopatches were washed with Ca2+-free PBS and fixed
with cold 4% paraformaldehyde (EMS) for 15min on a rocker. Tissues were
blocked and permeabilized in 3D block solution (PBS, 0.5% Triton-X100, 5%
chicken serum) for 2–3 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C, and incubated
with 1° antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) overnight at 4 °C. After washing, tis-
sues were incubated with species-appropriate AlexaFluor (Invitrogen) secondary
antibodies (1:1000 dilution) overnight at 4 °C. Tissues were mounted on micro-
scope slides in Fluoromount-G (EMS), covered with a coverglass and sealed with
nail polish for long-term preservation of fluorescence. Images were taken on a Leica
SP5 inverted confocal microscope and post processed with ImageJ.
Immunofluorescent analysis ex vivo. Structural analysis of implanted (dorsal
window chamber and rat heart) cardiopatches was performed in one of two ways:
(1) whole-mount staining, similar to in vitro protocol above, and (2) cryosectioning
with subsequent immunostaining. Notably, dorsal window chamber-bearing mice
were euthanized via isoflurane inhalation and aortic transection, and full-thickness
dorsal skin regions containing cardiopatches were immediately cut out under cold-
Tyrode’s solution, rinsed with PBS and fixed with 2% PFA for 24–48 h at 4 °C.
Skin/patch explants were allowed to equilibrate in 30% sucrose solution for
1–3 days at 4 °C, embedded in OCT, slowly frozen on liquid nitrogen, and cut into
10 μm sections on a cryostat. For immunostaining, frozen sections were rinsed with
PBS to remove OCT, blocked with 2D block solution (PBS, 0.2% Triton-X, 5%
chick serum) for 2–3 h at room temperature, incubated with 1° antibodies (Sup-
plementary Table 2) diluted in PBS + 5% chick serum overnight at 4 °C, and then 2°
antibodies diluted similarly for 1 h. A single drop of Fluoromount-G was added
onto each section and then covered with a coverglass, sealed with nail polish and
imaged on an Axio Observer fluorescent microscope. For epicardially implanted
patches, rat hearts were directly immersed in OCT after ex vivo imaging/mapping,
slowly frozen on liquid nitrogen, and cut into 10 μm sections on a cryostat. After
rinsing off the OCT, sections were post-fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at room
temperate, and subsequently blocked, immunostained and imaged in the same
fashion as sections from dorsal window chamber explants.
qRT-PCR. RNA was isolated from 1–3-week-old cardiopatches using a total RNA
isolation kit (Bio-Rad). To minimize changes in gene expression during handling of
tissues, cardiopatches were flash-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen after taking
out of culture and thawed directly in lysis buffer. For comparison with age-matched
2D monolayers, hiPSC-CMs were plated in parallel onto Matrigel-coated (Corning)
24-well plates at a density of 1 × 105 cells/cm2, cultured in the same medias as
cardiopatches (3D RB + d0–7, 5% FBS d7–21), and lysed directly in wells. RNA
purity and concentration was measured on a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA was converted into cDNA using the iScript cDNA
Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Human gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table 3)
were validated using adult left ventricle control samples isolated from healthy
males (Duke Human Heart Repository, IRB protocol Pro00005621) and verified to
have >85% primer efficiency. qRT-PCR reactions were setup using iTaq SYBR
Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and run on an ABI 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR
system (Applied Biosystems) in triplicates. 5 ng of cDNA was run per well of a 384-
well plate using 10 µL reactions. Relative expression of target genes was quantified
by the ΔΔCt method using GAPDH as the housekeeping gene.

 Western blotting and protein/DNA ratio. To isolate protein from tissues, 3-
week-old cardiopatches were cut with scissors in 100–120 µL of ice-cold RIPA lysis
buffer (Thermo Fisher) containing protease inhibitor (Sigma), vortexed periodi-
cally for 2–3 h, and centrifuged at 15,000×g for 30 min to remove the insoluble
fraction. When appropriate, phosphatase inhibitor (Cocktail 3, Sigma) was added
to lysis buffer to prevent de-phosphorylation. Protein from input cell population
(d0 of cardiopatch) was isolated by pelleting dissociated cells, resuspending in lysis
solution, and analogous high-speed centrifugation. Protein concentration was
measured with a Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher), with absorbance
readings taken at 560 nm. Twenty micrograms of protein was run per lane on a
4–15% Mini-Protean TGX gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a 0.2 µm nitrocellulose
membrane (Bio-Rad). Membranes were blocked in TBS containing 0.1% Tween-20
and 5% milk, carefully cut along desired molecular weight markers, and incubated
with primary antibodies (Supplementary Table 2) overnight at 4 °C in custom-
sealed plastic bags to minimize antibody use. HRP-conjugated secondary anti-
bodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. Chemiluminescence was
performed using SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) and imaged using a ChemiDoc MP system (Bio-Rad). Protein
bands were quantified using densitometry on Image Lab software (Bio-Rad). To
calculate protein/DNA ratios, absolute protein and DNA concentrations were
measured from replicate patches. DNA was isolated using a DNeasy Blood &
Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and quantified on a NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Transmission electron microscopy. Three-week-old cardiopatches were fixed in
4% gluteraldehyde (EMS) for 1 h at room temperature and stored in 0.1 M phos-
phate buffer (PB). Tissues were treated with 2% osmium tetroxide diluted in 0.1M
PB for 45 min and subsequently dehydrated in solutions with increasing acetone
content (30%, 50% 70%, 95%, 100%). Tissues were equilibrated in a 1:1 mixture of
acetone and epoxy (Embed 812 resin kit, EMS) overnight, embedded in resin, cured
and cut into 60 nm sections using an UltraCut-E microtome (Leica Reichert Jung)
equipped with a diamond blade and a water reservoir. Sections were stained with
0.5% uranyl acetate and imaged on a Phillips CM-12 inverted TEM microscope
equipped with an XR-60 camera (Advanced Microscopy Techniques).
Lentivirus production and transduction. Lentiviral plasmids were constructed
from the pRRL-CMV vector (a gift from Dr Inder Verma, Salk Institute). The
CMV promoter was substituted by muscle specific promoter MHCK7 driving
expression of GCaMP645 (pRRL-MHCK7-GCaMP6; Addgene plasmid #65042)69.
High-titer lentiviruses were produced using second generation lentiviral packaging
system. Briefly, 293FT cells (Life Technologies, R700-07) were co-transfected with
lentiviral plasmid, packaging plasmid psPAX2 and envelope plasmid pMD2.G
(4:2:1 mass ratios) using Lipofectamine 2000 (Life Technologies). Supernatant
containing lentiviral particles was collected 72 h after transfection, centrifuged
(500×g, 10 min) and filtered through 0.45 mm cellulose acetate filter (Corning) to
remove cell debris before combined with Lenti-X Concentrator (Clontech) at 3:1
volume ratio for overnight incubation at 4 °C. Concentrated lentiviral particles
were harvested following 45 min centrifugation (1500×g, 4 °C) and resuspended in
1/10 to 1/100 of the original volume in DMEM medium. Plasmids psPAX2 and
pMD2.G were obtained from Didier Trono (Addgene plasmids #12260 and
#12259). hiPSC-CMs were transduced with MHCK7-gCaMP6 lentivirus following
metabolic purification and replating, generally ~d15 of differentiation. Lentiviral
concentration was titrated (1:100 to 1:1000 dilution) to minimize toxicity and
achieve transduction efficiencies >80% following overnight transduction.
Implantation into mouse dorsal skinfold window chambers. All animal
experiments were approved by the Duke University IACUC and followed approved
ethical practices. Dorsal skinfold window chamber surgeries were done per pre-
viously established methods43,44. Nude mice (male, ~10 weeks of age; 22–30 g)
were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg) and xyla-
zine (10 mg/kg). Using sterile techniques, the dorsal skin was attached to a tem-
porary metal “C-frame” along the midline of the back. The skin was perforated in
three locations with a 16G needle to accommodate the screws of the chamber, and
a circular region (~12 mm) of the forward-facing skin (including cutis, subcutis,
retractor and panniculus carnosis muscles, and associated fascia) was cut away to
accommodate the window proper. The front and rear pieces of the titanium dorsal
skinfold chamber were assembled together from opposite sides of the skin, and
hiPSC-CM cardiopatches were laid perpendicular to the intact panniculus carnosis
muscle of the rearward-facing skin. A sterile cover glass was placed over the
window and secured by placing a stainless-steel retaining ring into the locking
grooves of the chamber. At all times during the procedure, exposed muscle/fascia
and engineered tissues were superfused with sterile saline solution to prevent from
drying. The chamber was secured to the skin by running a mattress suture along
the metal frame, and the “C-frame” was removed. Post-operatively, mice were
injected subcutaneously with buprenorphine (1 mg/kg) analgesic and allowed to
recover on a heating pad.
Intravital imaging of vasculature and Ca2+ transients. Degree of cardiopatch
vascularization within dorsal window chambers was assessed on days 7 and 14 post
implantation. Mice were anesthetized by nose cone inhalation of isoflurane and
placed on a heating pad under a microscope objective. Hyperspectral brightfield
image sequences (10 nm increments from 500 to 600 nm) were captured at ×5
magnification using a tunable filter (Cambridge Research & Instrumentation, Inc.)
and a DVC camera (ThorLabs), as previously described43,44. A custom MATLAB
(MathWorks) script was applied to create maps of total hemoglobin concentration,
which were further processed using local contrast enhancement in ImageJ (CLAHE
plugin, FIJI) and thresholded to binary images to identify vessel area and calculate
blood vessel density (BVD, total area of blood vessels per patch area; Supple-
mentary Fig. 17).
Spontaneous Ca2+ transients were recorded in real-time immediately after
imaging of blood vessels while mice were still under anesthesia. Fluorescent
gCaMP6 signals in implanted patches were imaged through a FITC-filter using a
fast fluorescent camera (Andor, at 16 μm spatial and 20 ms temporal resolution).
Amplitudes of spontaneous Ca2+ transients were determined using the Solis
software (Andor) by averaging relative fluorescence intensity (dF/F = [Fpeak− Fbase]/
Fbase) from three ~400 × 400 μm2 regions within each patch44.
Surgical implantation of cardiopatches onto rat hearts. All animal experiments
were approved by the Duke IACUC and followed approved ethical practices.
Cardiopatches were subjected to an established pro-survival protocol70 consisting
of a 1 h heat shock treatment 24 h pre-implantation and a 1hr incubation with a
cocktail of pro-survival factors (cyclosporine A, IGF-1, pinacidil, Bcl-xL-BH4, and
QVD-OPH) immediately prior to surgery. Athymic (nude) rats (male, 10–12 weeks
old) were initially anesthetized via nose-cone isoflurane inhalation (3–4%). Under a
dissecting microscope, a tracheostomy was performed on animals placed in supine
position, and a 16-G blunt needle was inserted into the trachea and connected to a
ventilator. Mechanical ventilation (75 bpm, 2.3–3 L/min at 14.7 PSIA (1.0 bar),
isoflurane 1.5–2% with supplemental oxygen) maintained adequate sedation for the
duration of the procedure. The left lateral thoracic ventral surface was prepped
using aseptic techniques, and left thoracotomy was performed through the 3rd
intercostal space. After opening of the pericardial sac, cardiopatches were placed
onto the anterior epicardial surface and sutured onto the heart with 6-0 poly-
propylene sutures in two diagonal corners of the patch frame. Cardiopatches were
superfused with sterile saline as necessary to ensure adequate hydration prior to
closure of the chest cavity, which was performed in a 2 to 3-layer fashion. Rats were
maintained on a heating pad and received pre-emptive analgesia in the form of
buprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg).
Imaging of Ca2+ transients in implanted cardiopatches. Rats containing
epicardially-implanted cardiopatches were anti-coagulated using an intraperitoneal
injection of heparin (5 mg/kg body weight) and anesthetized by isoflurane inha-
lation. Following sternotomy, the heart was excised and placed in ice-cold Tyrode’s
solution, and the aorta was cannulated with an 18-G feeding needle and secured
with suture thread. The heart was then maintained on a Langendorff perfusion
system with 37 °C oxygenated Tyrode’s solution, and flow rate was adjusted to
maintain a perfusion pressure of 60–80 mmHg. To assess whether each implanted
cardiopatch exhibited functional Ca2+ transients, the perfused heart was imaged by
an EMCCD camera with a 512 × 512 sensor (Andor iXon Ultra 897) and a 50 mm
f0.95 TV lens (Navitar) at a sampling rate of 50 Hz. The epicardial surface was
illuminated by a 465–495 nm LED light source (SciMedia LEX2) and viewed
through a 510–560 nm emission filter to image the cardiopatch-specific gCaMP6
calcium sensor. If spontaneous gCaMP6 flashing was not observed, then the
implantation site was probed with a platinum point electrode applying stimuli at a
rate of 1 Hz. Hearts that displayed functional patches (either spontaneous or
stimulus-induced gCaMP6 signals) were then used for dual mapping of electrical
propagation.
Dual mapping of implanted cardiopatches and rat hearts. Hearts were labeled
with voltage-sensitive dye by slowly injecting 3 ml of 5 µM di-4-ANEPPS into the
perfusion line, and the perfusate was changed to Tyrode’s solution with 10 µM
blebbistatin to prevent motion artifacts. The hearts were simultaneously imaged by
two CMOS cameras (MiCAM Ultima, SciMedia) with 150 µm spatial resolution
(100 × 100 recording sites) at a 500 Hz sampling rate. Fluorescent emissions of
gCaMP6 and di-4-ANEPPS were separated by a dichroic mirror with a 565 nm
cutoff, a 510–560 nm emission filter for the gCaMP6 camera, and a >600 nm
longpass emission filter for the di-4-ANEPPS camera. To assess electrical coupling
of the patch to the heart, data were acquired during normal sinus rhythm and
during epicardial point pacing positioned several mm from the patch location. To
measure conduction velocity of cardiopatches, data were acquired while applying
point stimulus to the patch periphery. Epicardial CVs and APDs of the rat heart
were measured underneath the patch area identified by gCaMP6 activity and
surrounding the patch and compared to those of control (non-implanted) hearts.
Calculation of conduction velocity and action potential duration was performed
using custom MATLAB software.
Assessment of arrhythmogenesis in rat hearts. To assess host arrhythmo-
genicity following cardiopatch implantation, age-matched healthy control (no
surgery) and cardiopatch-implanted rat hearts were prepped as above, incubated

 with blebbistatin and di-4, and subjected to 1 s of burst pacing (2 Hz, and 6–20 Hz
in steps of 2 Hz, total of nine episodes) from the base of the ventricle. Electrical
activity was measured with a 1-min ECG recording via two electrodes inside the
recording chamber, as well as 5 s of optical mapping acquisition around the time of
pacing onset. Arrhythmias were determined based on erratic/rapid ECG activity
following discontinuation of burst pacing and were verified with optical mapping.
Arrhythmias were characterized by duration (e.g. <5 s on ECG) and qualitatively
described through voltage propagation movies obtained during optical mapping.
Arrhythmias were classified as unsustained if they self-terminated within 1 min
following burst pacing, and those longer than 1 min were classified as sustained.
Statistical analysis. Data were expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean
(SEM), with select data shown as dot-plots to demonstrate variability. Data were
tested for normality using the Shapiro–Wilks test. Unless stated otherwise,
experiments involving two groups were analyzed with an unpaired Student’s t-test
after ensuring comparable variance among groups. For experiments involving more
than two groups, data were analyzed with a one-way ANOVA followed by a post-
hoc Tukey’s test. Gene expression analysis was performed on log-transformed data
and normalized to adult left ventricle controls for each set. Intravital blood vessel
density and gCaMP6 dF/F values were analyzed with a two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA (followed by post-hoc Tukey’s tests) and a paired t-test, respectively. Data
were analyzed with JMP Pro 13 with a significance level set to α = 0.05. Different
levels of significance were reported for individual experiments and noted in the
figure legends. Sample sizes for in vitro experiments were determined based on
variance of previously reported measurements23,24. Sample sizes for animal studies
were determined, in part, based on cost and animal availability. During fabrication
and electromechanical testing of cardiopatches, tissues from various groups were
alternated to reduce confounding variables. No randomization of animal groups
was necessary for window chamber experiments. Rat heart optical mapping was
alternated between control and cardiopatch-implanted hearts. No blinding of
animal experiments was done.
Data availability. All data supporting the results of these studies are available
