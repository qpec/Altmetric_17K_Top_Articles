Gender and sex analysis is increasingly recognized as a key factor in creating better 
medical research and healthcare1-7. Using a sample of more than 1.5 million medical 
research papers, our study examined the potential link between women’s participation 
in medical science and attention to gender- and sex-related factors in disease-specific 
research. Adjusting for variations across countries, disease topics and medical research 
areas, we compared the participation of women authors in studies that do and do not 
involve gender and sex analysis. Overall, our results show a robust positive correlation 
between women’s authorship and a study’s likelihood of engaging gender and sex 
analysis. These findings corroborate discussions of how women’s participation in 
medical science links to research outcomes, and illustrate the mutual benefits of 
promoting both women’s scientific advancement and the integration of gender and sex 
analysis into medical research. 
 
Despite a burgeoning scholarship, gender and sex differences remain unaddressed 
in large parts of medical research. Consider, for instance, the paradigmatic example of 
biological sex differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) – the no. 1 ‘killer’ among adult 
populations in the Western world. Since the 1980s, the annual number of CVD-related deaths 
has been higher for women than for men; but women continue to be underrepresented as 
participants in clinical trials8-10. A similar pattern is found in cancer research, where male 
research subjects dominate the trials11, or in studies of cell tissue and laboratory animals, 
where the sex of the subject often goes unrecorded12,13. Even in research involving both 
sexes, data is often not analysed by sex, and results may therefore not be accurate for either 
male or female subjects14. Both women and men face disadvantages under these 
circumstances. Around one third of osteoporosis-related hip fractures occur in elderly men, 
but osteoporosis research tends to focus on women, resulting in osteoporosis in men being 
underdiagnosed, undertreated, and underreported15.

Not only biological sex but also gender (i.e., the social attitudes and behaviours 
associated with being a woman or a man) is known to be a critical determinant of human 
health8,9. Women and men are exposed to different occupational hazards (e.g., ergonomic 
demands and psychosocial stressors), and differ on a wide array of health-related lifestyle 
behaviours (e.g., exercise, alcohol and tobacco use)16,17. Further, gendered psychosocial 
factors have been found to predict recurrent outcomes in patients with acute coronary 
syndrome and to moderate patient-perceptions of pain18,19. Despite robust evidence, 
associations between gender, biological sex and health outcomes remain largely neglected in 
the literature20, with potentially life-threatening and costly consequences. Of the ten drugs 
withdrawn from the U.S. market between 1997 and 2000, eight involved health risks for 
women that may have been avoided if more attention had been devoted to gender- and sex-
related factors21.  
 
These examples demonstrate how gender and sex analysis (henceforth GSA) has 
the potential to improve medical diagnosis and treatment. Here we define GSA as scientific 
approaches aimed at understanding how social and behavioural differences between women, 
men and gender-diverse people (gender analysis) and biological differences between female 
and male research subjects (sex analysis) relate to health outcomes.  
 
A growing number of medical scholars and journal editors already acknowledge 
the importance of GSA in fostering excellence in medical science and healthcare1-7. Science 
agencies, too, subscribe to this idea (for an overview of national policy efforts see ref.22). 
Through the Horizon 2020 program, the European Commission (EC) has committed itself to 
“integrating the gender dimension into the research and innovation content (…) in order to 
improve the quality of research and stimulate innovation”23. Similarly, the US National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) recognizes that both gender and sex “play a role in how health and 
disease processes differ among individuals,” and have implemented guidelines 
  
 
4 
recommending that “sex as a biological variable will be factored into research designs, 
analyses, and reporting in vertebrate animal and human studies”24.  
 
Both the EC and NIH prioritize policies: 1) to advance the careers of women 
scientists, and 2) to encourage gender and sex analysis in research design. Yet, we know little 
about how these policy objectives may be linked. Are women and men equally likely to 
integrate gender and sex analysis into their research designs? 
 
While recognizing the crucial role played by funding agencies and scholarly 
journals in putting gender and sex on the scholarly agenda, our study is unique in analysing 
potential gender differences in medical scholars’ involvement in GSA. If gender variations 
are detected in our data, we are not proposing that they stem from innate differences in 
women’s and men’s scientific styles or preferences. Instead, we follow tenets in the literature 
on cultural diversity, and see gender as a cultural category shaping cognition, experience and 
perspective in the workplace, with implications for research interests and focus25-27.  
 
Sociological research illustrates how societal norms and expectations operate to 
cultivate gender-differentiated career aspirations in higher education and the labour market27. 
Existing research, for instance, documents clear gender differences in students’ selection of 
fields and medical specialties28,29; but gender norms and expectations may also spur 
variations in researchers’ choice of different forms of research within a given field or 
specialty27. Indeed, this idea already finds some support in the literature. Using meta-data 
from over eight million articles in JSTOR, Jevin West and colleagues demonstrate notable 
differences in women’s and men’s primary areas of specialization in a range of scholarly 
disciplines spanning the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities30. Using data from 
Sociological Abstracts, Ryan Light finds that women sociologists are overrepresented in 
research areas such as gender, race, family and medicine, while men dominate in political, 
comparative and economic sociology31. Juan Dolado and colleagues demonstrate notable 
  
 
5 
variations in women’s and men’s primary subfields in economic research: health, education, 
welfare and labour economics tend to be popular topics among women, while agricultural 
economics, fluctuations/business cycles, general equilibrium, comparative systems, and 
corporate finance are popular among men32. Finally, recent studies document a clear 
overrepresentation of women authors in social science journals on gender, feminism and 
sexuality33,34. 
 
Given the traditional conception of gender- and sex-related research as a woman-
dominated domain in the academy, we expect women’s involvement in GSA to be more 
congruent with prevailing gender norms and expectations than men’s. Broader cultural 
influences about appropriate gender-typed work may, in other words, draw a disproportionate 
number of women towards (and men away from) this form of research. A pioneering study 
finds women medical investigators more likely to address gender and sex in successful 
research proposals for the Canadian National Institutes of Health35. However, the results 
reported in this study are descriptive, and do not adjust for potential spurious associations 
resulting from differences in women’s and men’s participation across diseases and medical 
subfields.  
 
Our study has been designed to accommodate these potential biases. Using a 
global sample of more than 1.5 million medical research papers and adjusting for variations 
in the gender-composition of author teams across disease topics, countries and medical 
research areas, we compared women’s general participation and share of first and last 
authorships in studies that do and do not involve GSA. Our prior conjectures were that: 
 
1) A study’s likelihood of involving GSA increases with the proportion of women 
among its authors. 
2) A study’s likelihood of involving GSA increases if the first author is a woman.  
  
 
6 
3) A study’s likelihood of involving GSA increases if the last author is a woman. 
 
We focused on disease-specific medical research using peer-reviewed scholarly articles 
published in the period 2008-2015 as our basic unit of analysis. To identify studies using 
gender and sex analysis we used the GenderMed Database36,37, which is an extensive 
bibliographic archive of the existing medical literature analysing gender and sex differences. 
To determine the gender of authors, we used the name-to-gender assignment algorithm 
Gender API38. The analysis took place in two steps. First, we used descriptive statistics to 
document global gender disparities in authorship participation in disease-specific medical 
research. Second, we employed three logistic regression analyses to estimate how women’s 
overall representation in the author group and as first and last authors influenced a study’s 
likelihood of systematically using GSA. All models were estimated in a Bayesian framework 
with weakly informed default prior distributions39 (see Materials and Methods for more 
details).  
  
Figure 1 provides descriptive information on women’s representation per author 
group and share of first and last authorships in studies published from 2008 through 2015. 
Women comprise 40% of first authors, 27% of last authors and, on average, 35% of authors 
per author group in the full sample. Importantly women’s participation as first and last 
authors varies across geographical groupings (see Supplementary Table 1). Gender disparities 
are largest in East Asia (women first authors: 24%, women last authors: 16%) and smallest in 
Latin America (women first authors: 52%, women last authors: 40%). North American and 
Western European figures lie close to the global average. This latter is not surprising, given 
that 67% of first authors and 69% of last authors in our sample are affiliated with institutions 
in North America or Western Europe.

Figure 1. Women’s global share of first authors, last authors and full-group participation in disease-
specific medical research. Women comprise 40% of first authors (men 60%), 27% of last authors (men 
73%) and 35% of authors overall per paper (men 65%). N: 1,542,690. 
 
As a second step in the analysis, we illuminated differences in women’s (and men’s) 
full group participation and share of first and last authorships in studies that do and do not 
involve GSA.  Table 1 displays odds ratios, standard deviations and 95% credible intervals 
(CI) for the logistic regressions predicting a study’s likelihood of using GSA (outcome 
variable: Non-GSA=0, GSA=1) (See Materials and Methods for variable specifications). 
Model 1 and 2 specifies the effects attributable to female first and last authors, and model 3 
determines the impact of women’s overall representation in the author group. Conditioned on 
our model specifications and prior assumptions, women’s participation positively correlates 
with a study’s likelihood of using GSA for all three groups. This is in accordance with our 
initial conjectures. Odds ratios are 1.66 (CI: 1.53-1.79) for first authors (f_first), 1.56 (CI: 
1.44-1.68) for last authors (f_last) and 3.14 (CI: 2.74-3.59) for full group representation (fw).

Figure 2 displays estimated marginal means (EM-means) and credible intervals for 
the main predictors. EM-means enable us to specify mean-based differences in women’s (and 
men’s) estimated participation across GSA and non-GSA, while adjusting for co-variation 
attributable to all other variables in the models. As illustrated in the figure, women comprise 
40% of first authors in non-GSA studies and 49% in GSA studies. Differences in women’s 
participation for last authors and full author groups are 27% vs. 35% and 35% vs. 42%, 
respectively. The relative difference is largest for last authors (30%) and smallest for full 
author groups (20%). This indicates that the effect attributable to women’s participation is 
strongest when women serve as leaders of the author group.  
 
Figure 2. Plot of estimated marginal means. The figure specifies the estimated marginal means for f_first,  
f_last and fw in Model 1, 2 and 3. Error bars represent 95% credible intervals (for estimate specifications, 
see Supplementary Table 5). The plots visualize women’s participation (relative to men’s) as first authors, 
last authors and overall representation in the byline, for studies that do and do not involve GSA. The figure 
shows that women’s estimated share of authorships is higher in GSA studies than in non-GSA studies for 
all three author variables.  
 
In comparison, logistic regression models excluding all variables but the main 
predictors (f_first, f_last and fw) have odds ratios of 1.91 (CI: 1.77-2.06) for first authors, 
1.76 (CI: 1.63-1.89) for last authors, and 3.87 (CI: 3.43-4.36) for full author groups (for 
  
 
9 
model specifications see Supplementary Tables 6, 7 and 8). Further, using arithmetic means, 
differences in women’s average participation in non-GSA and GSA studies are 40% vs. 53% 
for first authors, 27% vs. 37% for last authors, and 35% vs. 45% for full author groups.

with Cauchy informative priors predicting GSA. Commonwealth Independent States is the reference group for 
the geographical variables. For more model specifications, see Supplementary Tables 2, 3 and 4. 
 
Two control variables in model 1, 2 and 3 also deserve attention. As displayed in 
Table 1, GSA studies are more likely to be carried out in disease-specific research areas with 
a high general representation of women. Odds ratios for this factor are 6.13 (CI: 3.55-10.00) 
for first authors (f_first MeSH), 4.76 (CI: 2.48-8.49) for last authors (f_last MeSH) and 4.86 
(CI: 2.55-8.58) for full author groups (fw MeSH). Women’s representation in the broader 
research areas (or specialties) circumscribing a given disease topic also has a positive effect. 
Odds ratios for this factor are 2.11 (CI: 1.36-3.19) for first authors (f_first SC), 4.32 (CI: 
  
 
10 
2.60-6.84) for last authors (f_last SC) and 1.98 (CI: 1.16-3.18) for full author groups (fw SC). 
This indicates that not only the gender composition of author groups but also the general 
gender composition of the context in which they operate play an important role in predicting 
a study’s focus on GSA. We do not know, however, whether this finding results from the fact 
that women more often specialize in topics, where disease-specific gender- and sex-related 
variations are likely to exist.  
 
In summary, our results provide global evidence linking a study’s likelihood of 
involving GSA to the presence of women in the author group, especially in leading positions 
as first and last authors.  
 
 Canadian researchers have already documented gender differences in funding 
applicants’ attention to GSA; but their analysis did not adjust for potential spurious 
associations resulting from differences in women’s and men’s participation across diseases 
and medical subfields35. We show that adjusting for such factors (and geographical 
variations) leads to more robust comparisons. Specifically, the odds ratios for the main 
predictors (f_first, f_last and fw) are reduced from 1.91 to 1.66 for first authors, 1.76 to 1.56 
for last authors and 3.87 to 3.14 for full author groups, when covariates adjusting for 
women’s participation across geographical groupings, disease-topics and medical sub-fields 
are factored into the logistic regression models. 
 
Further, our analysis documents notable global gender disparities in authorship 
participation. Women comprise 40% of first authors, 27% of last authors and 35% of the 
authors per author-group in disease-specific research. Given the findings of this paper, the 
modest share of women last authors is particularly troublesome, since last authors typically 
take the lead in identifying, planning and developing research questions in the health-related 
fields.  
  
 
11 
 
Our study adds to the existing literature in several important ways. First, it 
empirically links science policy-makers’ efforts to increase the numbers of women in 
academic medicine and to promote GSA. By doing so, it provides a strong argument for both 
policy objectives. In this regard, it is important to underline that GSA constitutes a small 
subset of the total number of articles published in the disease-specific medical literature. The 
majority of women and men are not engaged in this form of research.  
 
Second, our findings highlight the importance of devoting more systematic 
attention to the link between gender diversity and research outcomes in the academy. In a 
recent opinion piece in PNAS, NIH Director of Scientific Workforce Diversity Hannah 
Valantine and NIH Director Francis Collins encouraged the scientific community to develop 
approaches specifically designed to document the impact of diversity on the quality and 
outputs of academic medicine40. Our study pushes the research agenda forward by 
empirically demonstrating how gender diversity can expand health solutions by diversifying 
research methods to include gender and sex analysis. That is to say, expanding gender 
equality may have broader implications for knowledge and health outcomes than previously 
suspected.  
 
Future research might investigate whether similar relationships between women’s 
participation in research and the likelihood of deploying GSA can be detected in other fields. 
Evidence from the social sciences, where women are relatively well-represented, suggests 
that this may be the case31,33,34; but in the STEM-related areas, such as engineering and 
computer science, where gender and sex analysis is less prevalent and men dominate research 
teams, this question remains unexplored. There is, however, no reason to believe that the 
situation in STEM would be any different from the medical sciences. 
 
Like any other study, ours is characterized by certain caveats and limitations. First, 
the search algorithm employed to establish the corpus of GSA studies may, despite a 
  
 
12 
systematic and thorough screening strategy, not capture the full gamut of potentially relevant 
publications 36,37. Consequently, an unspecified number of “false negatives” (i.e., eligible 
GSA studies not specified as such) may exist in our baseline group of non-GSA studies. 
However, since GSA-related research constitutes a small subset of the total number of articles 
published in the disease-specific medical literature, we do not expect this to influence our 
results in any noteworthy way. And if so, it would most likely imply even stronger support 
for our conjectures, given the higher level of female participation in GSA studies. 
 
Second, status-related factors, not addressed in this paper, may play a part in 
explaining our findings. We know from social science research that when women enter male-
dominated fields, subtle forms of gender segregation tend to persist. Women may, for 
instance, self-select or be ‘ghettoized’ into less competitive and prestigious work areas41,42. 
To address such issues, future studies could investigate whether the relative status of GSA as 
well as funding opportunities (or lack hereof) are pushing a disproportionate number of 
women towards (and men away from) this form of research. In a supplementary analysis (see 
Supplementary Methods), we take a first step towards illuminating potential status 
differentials. Specifically, we compare the distribution of GSA and non-GSA publications 
according to journal impact. Despite a vast array of problems with such measures, metrics of 
journal impact are widely used as proxies of achievement and status in the medical 
sciences43,44, and most medical scholars acknowledge the existence of a journal hierarchy in 
their disciplines. As demonstrated in Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 1, our 
data provides no indications of any systematic status variations between the journals where 
GSA and non-GSA studies are published, but more research is needed to illuminate the 
influence of other potential status- and resource-related differences. 
 
Finally, engaging GSA requires know how. Anyone, irrespective of gender, can be 
trained to do this effectively. Indeed, granting agencies and universities have begun to initiate 
  
 
13 
workshops and incentive programs to integrate GSA into research design, and future studies 
could investigate the impact of such programs in enhancing the external validity and 
applicability of scientific research with human outcomes. 
 
Our study establishes an empirical link between gender diversity in the scientific 
workforce and research outcomes. Our findings show a symbiotic relationship between 
increasing the numbers of women in academic medicine and enhancing excellence in 
research by incorporating gender and sex analysis. Hence, our study provides empirical 
evidence for science policy makers to promote both women’s scientific careers and gender 
and sex analysis in research design. Taken together these objectives support the twin goals of 
diversity and excellence in science.  
 
Materials and Methods 
Data. Data for this study were harvested from PubMed’s Medline. Medline is one of the most 
exhaustive databases of the medical journal literature and offers a systematic hierarchy of 
Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) for indexing scholarly articles; e.g., on the basis of 
disease topics. We gathered bibliographic metadata for all Medline articles with disease-
specific MeSH terms for the period 2008 through 2015, resulting in 2,512,371 records (see 
Supplementary Methods). To obtain information on author first names and country of 
institutional affiliation, 2,124,998 of these were matched to records in the citation database 
Web of Science (WoS) (see Supplementary Methods). This information was utilized to 
determine the gender of authors using the name-to-gender assignment algorithm Gender 
API38 (see Supplementary Methods). For each first name and nation pair, Gender API 
provided an estimate specifying the certainty of the given name-to-gender assignment. To 
validate its accuracy, we conducted a manual quality control of 500 randomly selected 
authors from the dataset (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 10). Papers 
  
 
14 
lacking full first-name information for one or more authors were excluded from the analysis. 
Supplementary Fig. 2 details the data inclusion and exclusion steps, including the assignment 
of gender to author first names, leading to the final sample of 1,542,690 documents (61.4% of 
the total population). Supplementary Fig. 3 displays the distribution of fw-scores as a function 
of the number of authors per paper in the dataset. 
To identify studies using gender and sex analysis, we matched the WoS sample with 
the GenderMed Database36,37. GenderMed is an extensive bibliographic archive of the 
existing medical literature analysing gender and sex differences. Based on a screening of 
more than 13 million MEDLINE abstracts and 40,000 full-text manuscripts, approximately 
13,000 studies, extending back to 1975, have been made available (see Supplementary 
Methods). GenderMed includes 4,830 studies with MeSH terms subordinate to a disease 
category for the period 2008-2015, of which 3,394 (70.3% of the population) matched with 
our WoS sample (see Supplementary Methods). A manual quality check of 500 GenderMed 
articles was carried out to verify the accuracy of the database in identifying research 
involving GSA (see Supplementary Methods). 
The GenderMed database limits its scope to selected diseases that field experts have 
deemed epidemiologically relevant for GSA37. Thus, we excluded all studies in our final 
sample (N: 1,542,690) that did not overlap with studies in the GenderMed subsample (N: 
3,394) with respect to disease-specific MeSH terms. This exclusion resulted in a reduced 
sample of 1,513,638 unique disease-specific papers, which was used in the logistic regression 
analyses (see Supplementary Methods).  
Outcome variable. GSA is the binary outcome variable in models 1, 2 and 3. The 
variable is used to predict a study’s likelihood of systematically using gender and sex 
analysis. Specifically, it dissociates the GenderMED sample from the remaining articles in 
the WoS-database (Non-GSA=0, GSA=1).

Main predictors and covariates. For each article in the full data-set (N: 1,542,690), 
we computed the weighted indicator fw to specify the general participation of women authors 
in a given study. fw values range from 0 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating a higher share 
of women in the author group (see Supplementary Methods). To account for within-group 
variations in women’s (and men’s) representation across countries, disease topics and 
medical subject areas, we also computed average fw scores for the following variables: MeSH 
disease-terms (fw MeSH), WoS subject categories classified based on journal information (fw 
SC) and last-author country (fw country). fw MeSH was included to adjust for differences in 
the average gender composition of authors across disease-specific research topics, while fw 
SC was constructed to account for covariation attributable to women’s varying participation 
across medical research areas and specialties (See Supplementary Methods). The latter 
control variable is important, since a given disease-term may be addressed by researchers in 
different research areas and specialties.  A complementary method using MeSH disease-terms 
to capture medical research specialties was examined but did not yield any improvements 
compared to the WoS subject-category based approach45.  
Based on Gender API estimates, we also calculated gender indices for first and last 
authors (f_first and f_last). Further, we computed average f_first and f_last scores for MeSH 
disease-terms (f_first MeSH and f_last MeSH), WoS subject-categories (f_first SC and f_last 
SC) and author country (f_first country and f_last country) (see Supplementary Methods). A 
supplementary analysis was carried out to estimate the prevalence of non-traditional author 
listings based on alphabetical order, as these may bias the odds-ratio estimations for the key 
predictors f_first and f_last in the analysis. We found the intentional use of alphabetized 
author listings to be very rare and unlikely to influence our results in any notable way (see 
Supplementary Methods). 
  
 
16 
Additional control variables were constructed to help prevent potential 
misspecifications in the logistic regression models. To capture the influence of cultural and 
socio-economic factors across area-specific contexts, we included 10 categorical variables 
based on geographical groupings (for specifications on country groupings see Supplementary 
Table 13). Further, author-country information was used to compute ranked variables 
capturing covariation attributable to national differences in overall level of gender equality 
and annual R&D-related health expenditure, but these variables were excluded from the final 
models due to trivial variance (see Supplementary Methods) (variable specifications are 
available in Supplementary Table 14). 
 
Statistical models. All models were estimated in a Bayesian framework with weakly 
informed default prior distributions39. A Bayesian framework is transparent and enables 
flexible estimation of parameters based on prior information and data. Proper uncertainties in 
estimates are calculated providing intuitive interpretations and direct inferences of hypotheses 
conditioned on the data. A simple Bayesian logistic modelling approach to estimate posterior 
distributions of the coefficients was applied. A basic generic binominal model with a logit 
link function was used for all specifications (Equation 1). 
(1) 
������������������������ ~ Bin(������������, ������������������������), 
������������������������ = logit−1 (������������������������), 
������������������������ = ������������0 + � ������������������������
������������
������������=1
 
Following Gelman et al.39, we assigned default independent Cauchy prior distributions with 
location parameter 0 (µ) and scale parameter 2.5 (σ), to all coefficients ������������0, ������������������������, ������������ = 1, … , ������������. 
This prior is proposed as a default choice because it is weakly informative, but allows 
inferences to be made even in the presence of complete separation.  Given the size of the data 
  
 
17 
sets used in models 1, 2 and 3, the expected influence of the weakly informed priors on the 
estimated posterior parameters will be less pronounced. The posterior distributions were 
estimated empirically by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques using the R 
package “MCMCpack”46,47. All models used 5,000 burn-in and 50,000 Metropolis iterations 
for the sampler with a tuning parameter of 0.25. To summarize and visualize findings from 
the three models, we estimated marginal means for the main predictors using the “lsmeans” 
package in R48. The descriptive analysis of gender disparities in authorship was based on the 
full sample of 1,542,690 papers, while the reduced sample of 1,513,638 was employed in the 
regression models.

Analysis concerning journal status. We examined the distribution of GSA and non-GSA 
publications according to journal status. Journal status is operationalized as a journal citation 
indicator, where we measure the citation impact for the annual volume of research and review 
articles for a particular journal in the year it published the GSA and/or non-GSA study. We use 
two journal citation indicators, one unnormalised indicator (i.e. js = journal score) where citations 
are not adjusted to variations in citation rates across fields; and one normalised indicator (i.e. njs 
= normalised journal score). Both indicators are calculated with a two and a five-year citation 
window (i.e. js_2yr, js_5yr, njs_2yr, njs_5yr). Notice, the unnormalised journal score essentially 
corresponds to Clarivate Analytics’ (formerly Thomson Reuters) Journal Impact Factor. We 
calculate medians and means for the GSA and non-GSA publications as an indicator of their 
general journal publication status. Notice, as strong outliers are present in both cases we focus on 
median status. As a comparison to the GSA-sample, we randomly selected first 4,000 and then 
50,000 non-GSA publications and estimated their central tendencies. Supplementary Table 9 
provides descriptive statistics, and Supplementary Fig. 1 presents boxplots of the random sample 
of 4,000 non-GSA publications (results are robust so we do not show a similar plot for the 50,000 
sample). 
MeSH. The MeSH thesaurus is a controlled, hierarchical indexing system curated by the National 
Institutes of Health. The vocabulary is freely accessible in a machine-readable format using the 
Entrez e-utils1. We used this option to harvest article metadata for all studies indexed with MeSH-
terms subordinate to the “Diseases Category”.  
 
Web of Science. In contrast to PubMed, WoS includes full first-name information for the vast 
majority of articles registered since 2008. We used a modified version of the WoS database 
maintained by the CWTS (Center for Science and Technology Studies) at Leiden University to 
retrieve WoS records for our PubMed dataset. More specifically, WoS and PubMed records were 
matched using first DOI, then ISSN, journal names, pagination, volume and fuzzy title matches 
relying on relative Levenshstein distance. Due to query limitations, a matching approach using 
PMIDs in the WoS interface was not viable. Tests also indicated that merely 2.5% additional 
records would have been matched using this approach. Supplementary Fig. 2 provides an overview 
of the data inclusion and exclusion steps. 
 
Gender API. Gender API determines the gender of a given individual based on first name and 
country of origin (Laurence, for instance, is a female name in France but a typical male name in 
the U.S.). Accordingly, Gender API supports gender assignment for 1,871,879 names from 178 
countries. The underlying coding-script and determination process remains unspecified by the API 
developers, but a randomized test sample confirms its accuracy (more on this below). Due to data-
limitations, de facto information on country of origin is not available to us. Thus, for the purpose 
of country specification, we used WoS information for the country of a given author’s institutional 
affiliation. Full first-names were not available for all WoS documents (all papers with authors 
using first-name initials were excluded from the final data set), and the Gender API algorithm 
  
 
 
 
4 
failed to assign gender to rare first names, leaving a total of 1,542,690 papers for further analysis 
(See Supplementary Fig. 2).  
 
Specifically, Gender API provides an accuracy score estimating a given first name’s probability 
of belonging to a man or a woman, accounting for country. This prediction ranges from 50 to 100. 
We converted the Gender API accuracy scores for women and men into a single indicator 
specifying the probability of a name belonging to a woman, denoted f. f-scores range from 0 to 1 
with values closer to 1 indicating a higher likelihood of the author being female.  
 
Validation of Gender API Assignments.  
Following the approach of Larivière et al.2, we used WoS author information to search the web 
for biographical information, resumes or photos and other information that could confirm its 
estimations. Supplementary Table 10 provides an overview of the outcomes of this validation. 
The second column represents the outcomes of the Gender API algorithm. The three columns to 
the right represent the outcomes of the manual validation. Numbers marked in bold represent the 
share of “false positives”, i.e. female authors with a “male” f-score of <.41, or male authors with 
a “female” f-score of >0. 60. Thirteen author names (i.e. 0.3% of the total sample) were unknown 
to the algorithm and 27 (i.e. 0.5%) fell into the unisex category – here defined as author names 
with f-scores ranging from .41-.60. Specifications on the countries and journals represented in 
the Gender-API validation sample are displayed in Supplementary Fig. 4 and 5. 
 
GenderMed database. GenderMed combines systematic searches in PubMed with an Apache 
Lucene based text-mining algorithm to regularly screen MEDLINE for new studies adopting 
gender- and sex-based approaches. Manual quality control is continuously performed to ensure the 
accuracy of the tool (for further specifications on the database structure and methodology, see ref.3-
5). 
 
Identification of studies involving gender and sex analysis. In total, the GenMed database 
includes 5,185 gender- and sex-focused articles for the period 2008-2015. Of these, 4,830 are 
indexed with MeSH “Disease-categories”. The initial matching with the WoS records resulted in 
a data-set of 3,093 gender- and sex-based studies with author-gender specifications. Yet, after a 
manual hand-coding of articles with only first-name initials and unreadable author-names due to 
formatting issues, this number increased to 3,394 (70.3% coverage). 
 
Validation of GenderMed data. We randomly selected 500 of the 3,394 GenderMed studies 
included in the final sample. We carefully read the abstract (and in cases of doubt also the full text) 
of each study, to determine its eligibility for inclusion in GenderMed. We used the original 
inclusion and exclusion criteria laid out by Oertelt and colleagues4: [inclusion a] The study 
includes “a description of sex/gender-specific differences in the analysed species (human, mouse, 
rat and so on)”. [inclusion b] The study presents an “analysis of data with respect to sex/gender-
specific differences”. [exclusion a] The study does not include sex/gender-specific description and 
analysis of results. [exclusion b] The study presents “generalized statements without descriptions 
  
 
 
 
5 
of performance analysis, for example ‘no gender differences were found’”. [exclusion c] The study 
refers “to the analysed condition (for example, “hypertension”) only as co-morbidity, confounder, 
or anamnestic finding”. 488 papers (i.e. 97.6% of the test sample) were deemed eligible for 
inclusion in GenderMed. The remaining 12 studies did not present an analysis of data with respect 
to sex/gender differences. Yet many of them presented themes closely related to GSA, such as: 
pharmacokinetic parameters for pregnant women; gender-specific HIV prevention interventions 
targeting African American men; condom use and self-perceived HIV risk among female sex 
workers; and gender-specific health promotion targeting African American men.  
 
Excluding disease-specific topics not covered by the GenderMed database. We identified all 
disease-specific MeSH terms (and their related lower-level terms in the MeSH tree) addressed by 
at least one of the 3,394 studies in the GenderMed subsample. The full sample (N: 1,542,690) 
covered 4,709 unique disease-specific terms of which 4,341 were assigned to studies in the 
GenderMed subsample. We excluded all studies that did not have at least one disease-specific 
MeSH term (or a related lower-level term) in common with a study in the GenderMed subsample.  
 
Predictors in the logistic regressions. Gender API provides an estimate of its accuracy in 
determining the gender of any name and country pair. We convert this estimate into a probability 
of a name belonging to a female or a male researcher and denote this probability f. f is used to 
compute the weighted indicator, fw, which is the mean f-value for the author group as a whole. 
Due to the uncertainty associated with the Gender API classification, the use of this indicator is 
only meaningful at the aggregate level. A paper with fw = 0.8 could, for instance, be authored by 
two women, while another all-male paper might have fw = 0.2. We also calculate specific f-scores 
for first and last authors, denoted f_first and f_last. MeSH disease-terms derived from 
MEDLINE’S thesaurus are used as a proxy for disease-specific topics. WoS subject categories are 
used to capture the broader research areas or medical specialties in which a given study is carried 
out. Specifically, WoS classifies papers into subject categories (e.g. oncology, ophthalmology and 
orthopaedics) based on journal information. Medical studies are typically indexed under more than 
one MeSH disease-term and WoS subject-category. Thus, our calculations of fw MeSH and fw 
SC are based on weighted averages. Specifically, we calculated the average fw-score for all papers 
with a given MeSH disease-term or SC-category assigned to them. For a given study with three 
MeSH-terms, we weighted each term by ⅓ in the calculation of fw MeSH. The same procedure 
was used for fw_SC. fw country was calculated as the average fw-score per last-author country. 
f_first MeSH, f_last MeSH, f_first SC, f_last SC, f_first country and f_last country were 
computed using the same approach.  
 
Covariates in the logistic regressions.  Since last authors typically take the lead in identifying 
topics and developing research questions, the coding of the 10 geographical variables (Arab 
states, East Asia, Oceania etc.), was based on the last-authors’ country affiliation. We constructed 
the gender equality indicator, GE Index, based on the United Nations’ ranking of countries in the 
Gender Development Index (for specifications on rank see ref.6). The ranked variable capturing 
  
 
 
 
6 
Domestic R&D Health expenditure as percentage of GDP (Health_Expd) was computed using 
data from WHO7. 
 
Listing of authors. A custom-made algorithm was built to examine the prevalence of author 
listings based on alphabetical order. The algorithm compared the actual listing of authors in each 
document in the dataset to an alphabetical order. Only papers with at least four authors were 
included in the analysis, as the chance of randomly occurring alphabetization is too high for smaller 
numbers of authors. A pseudo-code representation of the algorithm is shown below.  
 alphabetization = true; 
x = 0; 
select author_order_nums from document, order by author_last_name ascending, first name

Supplementary Table 11 presents the results of the analysis.  n_authors refers to the number of 
authors per paper, p_total specifies the total number of papers per n_authors value, p_alpha gives 
the number of papers using alphabetical order per n_authors value and pp_alpha shows the 
percentage share of documents using alphabetical order per n_authors value. chance specifies the 
expected occurrence of alphabetical order by chance. Specifically, we calculated all possible 
permutations for each n_author value, assuming one of these was ordered alphabetically (e.g. 
n_authors: 4, possible permutations: 24, chance: 1/24= 4.17%). Since last names starting with a 
letter in the beginning of the alphabet may be more likely to occur in the database, this approach 
is not entirely accurate, but it enables us to roughly estimate the proportion of intentionally 
alphabetized author listings, which is presented in the column int_alpha. We calculated this 
proportion by subtracting chance from pp_alpha for each n_authors value. As displayed in the 
int_alpha column the prevalence of intentionally alphabetized author listings is limited to between 
0.08% and .24% of the papers with 4+ authors in our sample. 
 
Traditionally, authors in health economics have been known to follow conventions in economics 
and list authors based on alphabetical order. Since the typical number of authors per paper in health 
economics may be smaller than four, we carried out a specific analysis for this subfield. 
Supplementary Table 12 specifies the prevalence of alphabetized author listings for seven core-
field journals in health economics with at least ten disease-specific studies included in the dataset. 
Two journals, Journal of health economics and Health economics, have relatively high pp_alpha 
values, while values are low for the remaining journals. At the aggregate level, the intentional use 
of alphabetized author listings appears to be rare in disease-specific studies in health economics, 
and we have therefore chosen not to exclude papers published in this subfield from our analysis.

Supplementary Figure 1. Boxplot of aggregate journal-publication status for GSA and non-GSA publications. 
Journal status is approximated with journal citation indicators, two unnormalised (js) and two normalised indicators 
(njs). Both sets of journal indicators are calculated with two and five year citation windows. Journal indicator scores 
on the y-axis are shown on a log-scale to enable inclusion of outliers.

Supplementary Figure 3. Boxplots of fw as a function of the number of authors per paper. Each boxplot displays the 
median, interquartile ranges and 95% ranges plus outliers as individual dots. The horizontal histogram specifies the 
distribution of papers across the x-axis. The figure has been set to cut off at 30 authors per paper, but the actual data 
involves cases with up to 256 authors per paper.
