SUMMARY
The earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) are
characterized by the formation of mature tangles in
the entorhinal cortex and disorientation and confu-
sion when navigating familiar places. The medial en-
torhinal cortex (MEC) contains specialized neurons
called grid cells that form part of the spatial naviga-
tion system. Here we show in a transgenic mouse
model expressing mutant human tau predominantly
in the EC that the formation of mature tangles in old
mice was associated with excitatory cell loss and
deficits in grid cell function, including destabilized
grid fields and reduced firing rates, as well as altered
network activity. Overt tau pathology in the aged
mice was accompanied by spatial memory deficits.
Therefore, tau pathology initiated in the entorhinal
cortex could lead to deficits in grid cell firing and un-
derlie the deterioration of spatial cognition seen in
human AD.
INTRODUCTION
Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) composed of hyperphosphory-
lated
and
aggregated
microtubule-associated
protein
tau
(MAPT) are one of the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
(Lee et al., 2001). In the earliest stages of AD, NFTs accumulate
in the somatodendritic compartment of entorhinal cortex (EC)
neurons, especially in layers II and III. They then spread into
limbic and association cortices via the trisynaptic circuit in a pre-
cise and defined manner (Braak and Braak, 1991). Structural im-
aging studies demonstrate early and selective atrophy in the EC,
which correlates with severe cell loss of more than 70% of layer II
and 40% of layer III neurons (Braak and Braak, 1991; Go
´ mez-Isla
et al., 1996; Masdeu et al., 2005; Stranahan and Mattson, 2010),
and hypometabolism in functional imaging studies (Khan et al.,
2014). Thus, the EC has been implicated as a primary site of
dysfunction in the early stages of the disease.
Spatial navigation is known to be affected very early during AD
(reviewed in Lithfous et al., 2013), including in preclinical AD (Al-
lison et al., 2016), and the EC is known to play an important role in
spatial navigation (Fyhn et al., 2004; Jacobs et al., 2010; Moser
et al., 2008). The medial EC (MEC) contains several classes of
neurons with unique response characteristics, the best known
being grid cells (Hafting et al., 2005; Igarashi, 2016; Kropff
et al., 2015). Grid cells encode an animal’s spatial location by
selectively firing in a triangular grid-like pattern (grid fields)
across an environment. Because of the location of tangle pathol-
ogy in early AD, dysfunction in grid cell firing has been hypothe-
sized to underlie symptoms of spatial disorientation in AD,
including those at genetic risk of AD (Kunz et al., 2015).
We and others have generated a transgenic mouse model (line
EC-Tau) in which a highly aggregable form of MAPT is expressed
predominantly in the hippocampal formation under the control of
a neuropsin promoter fragment (Liu et al., 2012; de Calignon
et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2012). Using this mouse model, we
demonstrate that the accumulation of tau pathology in the EC
is associated with excitatory neuronal loss and grid cell dysfunc-
tion. Mice at this stage also show spatial learning and memory
deficits. This is the first study showing a relationship between
tau pathology and grid cell dysfunction in vivo, which may pro-
vide the link between tau pathology and spatial cognition deficits
in early AD.
RESULTS
Mature Tau Pathology Is Associated with Spatial
Memory Deficits in Aged EC-Tau Mice
We have previously shown that at younger ages (%14 months),
human tau in the EC-Tau mouse line was diffuse and mainly
distributed in axons, with a few cells in the EC and parasubic-
ulum (PaS) showing accumulation in the somatodendritic
compartment (Liu et al., 2012). By 30+ months of age, axonal
staining in EC-Tau mice was almost completely lost, and human
tau protein had accumulated extensively in cell bodies within
the hippocampal and parahippocampal regions, as well as in
extrahippocampal areas of the cortex (Figure 1A). There was
negligible somatodendritic human tau staining in control mice

 (Figure S1A, available online). To investigate whether mature tau
pathology in aged mice could induce learning and memory def-
icits, we compared EC-Tau and control mice at 14 and 30+
months of age by Morris water maze (MWM) and T-maze tests.
At 14 months of age, there were no significant learning and mem-
ory deficits in EC-Tau mice compared to matched controls (Fig-
ures 1B–1E), which is consistent with published data that
showed EC-Tau mice at 16 months of age were cognitively
normal (Harris et al., 2012; Polydoro et al., 2014). At 30+ months
of age, however, there were significant differences between EC-
Tau and control mice in escape latency (p < 0.05, 0.01, and 0.001
for trial days 2–4, respectively) (Figure 1B), the number of
Figure 1. Tau Pathology Is Associated with Spatial Memory Deficits in Aged EC-Tau Mice
(A) Tau pathology was identified in the EC and the hippocampal formation as well as in extrahippocampal areas of the cortex in 30+-month EC-Tau mice. Sections
from EC-Tau mice were stained with anti-tau antibodies (MC1, CP27, AT8, and AT180) and were developed using DAB as the chromagen. Tau immunoreactivity
is indicated by brown staining. High-magnification images of tau staining in the MEC are shown in the lower panel.

(n = 10 at 14 months and 7 at 30+ months) were tested in the MWM (B–D) and T-maze (E). Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. *p < 0.05 (EC-Tau 30+ months

days 3 and 4, B; 2 hr probe, C; 24 hr probe, D). A two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests was used to compare the escape latencies in
4 days of continuous MWM hidden platform trials. Separate unpaired t tests were used to compare the number of platform crossings in both 2 and 24 hr probe
trials at 14 and 30+ months. A chi-square test was used to compare the binary data (correct versus incorrect choice) from the T-maze test. See also Figure S1.

ure 1C) and 24 hr probe trial of MWM (t = 3.083, df = 12,
p = 0.0095) (Figure 1D), and the percent correct choice in
T-maze (chi-square = 4.822, df = 1, p = 0.0281) (Figure 1E). In
addition, there were significant differences in escape latency
(p < 0.001 and p < 0.05 for trial days 2 and 3, respectively) (Fig-
ure 1B) and the number of platform crossings in the 2 hr
(t = 4.393, df = 15, p = 0.0005) (Figure 1C) and 24 hr probe trial
of MWM (t = 4.954, df = 15, p = 0.0002) between control mice
at 14 months and control mice at 30+ months (Figure 1D), with
a trend to decrease that did not reach significance in the percent
of correct choice in the T-maze (chi-square = 0.8046, df = 1, p =
0.3697) in 30+-month control mice (Figure 1E). However, the dif-
ferences in escape latency (p < 0.001 for trial days 2–4), the num-
ber of platform crossings in the 2 hr (t = 7.085, df = 14, p < 0.0001)
and 24 hr probe trial of MWM (t = 4.736, df = 14, p = 0.0003), and
the percent of correct choice in the T-maze (chi-square = 6.513,
df = 1, p = 0.0107) between EC-Tau mice at 14 months and EC-
Tau mice at 30+ months were greater than the differences be-
tween controls at 14 and 30+ months. Moreover, there was no
significant difference in escape latency on trial day 4 between
control mice at 14 months and control mice at 30+ months,
but a significant difference between EC-Tau mice at 14 months
and EC-Tau mice at 30+ months (p < 0.001). Swim speed, visual
ability, and body weight were not significantly different between
experimental groups at 14 and 30+ months of age (Figures S1B–
S1D), which suggests that the learning and memory deficits in
aged EC-Tau mice were not attributable to abnormalities in
sensorimotor function, visual acuity, or body weight.
Reduced Grid Cell Firing and Periodicity in the Dorsal
MEC of Aged EC-Tau Mice
As the MEC is known to be involved in spatial learning and
memory, we wanted to test whether tau pathology impacts the
underlying physiology of MEC neurons. Multi-electrode in vivo
electrophysiology was used to extracellularly record from
neurons in the MEC of 14- and 30+-month EC-Tau mice and
age-matched controls (Figure 2). The animals were surgically im-
planted with 16-channel electrodes aimed at dorsal MEC (coor-
dinates were as follows: 3.1 mm lateral to lambda, 0.2 mm in
front of transverse sinus, angled at 6�–8� posterior and 0.8 mm
below the surface of the brain. See Method Details of STAR
Methods, ‘‘Electrode implantation and surgery’’) (Figures S3C
and S3D). The animals were then allowed to explore one of
several open field arenas each day for two sessions as we re-
corded single-unit and local field potentials (LFPs). Electrodes
were turned no more than 50 mm each day to maintain stable re-
cordings, and the electrophysiological data were analyzed to
identify neuronal firing patterns and network activity (see Fig-
ure S2 and STAR Methods for method details). A total of 434
excitatory neurons were recorded in 29 mice (for cell-type infor-
mation, see Method Details of STAR Methods, ‘‘In vivo recording
and cell classification’’). Grid cells were identified based on their
grid-like firing patterns, and their spatial periodicity was calcu-
lated into a grid score for each cell. Grid scores were calculated
for all cells and only those with positive grid scores were shuffled
randomly to obtain 122 grid cells that exceeded the 95th percen-
tile threshold (Figure S3A). At 14 months, we observed no differ-
ence in grid field patterns from EC-Tau mice compared to age-
matched controls (Figure 2A). However, 30+-month EC-Tau
mice showed poor specificity of grid field patterns compared
to other groups (Figure 2B). We observed reduced grid scores
in 30+-month EC-Tau mice compared to age-matched controls
(Figure 2C, left panel; p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U, 143.5), and
histograms (30 bins) of grid score percentages showed clear
separation of the 30+-month EC-Tau group from other groups
(Figure 2C, right panel). Grid cells in the 30+-month EC-Tau
mice also exhibited reduced peak firing (p < 0.0001, Mann-Whit-
ney U, 127.5) and average firing (p = 0.0161, Mann-Whitney U,
243.0) rates compared to age-matched controls (Figure 2D). In
addition, the grid cells of 30+-month EC-tau mice had reduced
information content, measured in bits per second, compared
to the aged controls (Figure 3A, left panel; p < 0.0001, Mann-
Whitney U, 146.5). We did not detect differences in grid cell infor-
mation content between the 14-month groups. There were no
differences in spatial coherence of grid cells between age-
matched groups (Figure 3A, right panel). We also analyzed firing
rates of other MEC cell types, including head-direction cells,
border cells, and non-classified cells, but did not detect any dif-
ferences in peak or average firing rates between age-matched
EC-Tau mice and controls (Figure S5).
Increased Interneuron Firing and Enhanced Power of
Theta in the Dorsal MEC of Aged EC-Tau Mice
MEC interneurons are intricately connected to stellate and pyra-
midal cells, including grid cells. Thus, we examined whether
firing properties of MEC interneurons were also altered in aged
EC-Tau mice as a result of tau pathology. A total of 93 interneu-
rons were recorded in 29 mice (for cell-type information, see
Method Details of STAR Methods, ‘‘In vivo recording and cell
classification’’). There were no significant differences in the pro-
portion of interneurons recorded with respect to other cell types
in any age group (p > 0.05; see STAR Methods). Putative inter-
neurons in the MEC were identified based on their narrow spike
widths and higher firing rates compared to wide spiking cells
(Quirk et al., 2009). We found the average firing rate of interneu-
rons was increased in 30+-month EC-Tau mice compared to
age-matched controls (p = 0.0193, Mann-Whitney U, 142.5),
with no effect between groups at 14 months (Figure 3B). Peak
firing rate was not affected in either group at any age. To inves-
tigate if the overall network activity in MEC was affected, LFPs
were also recorded and analyzed. We found an increase in
power distribution in the theta frequency range (4–12 Hz) in
30+-month EC-Tau mice compared to controls (Figures 3C–
3E; two-way ANOVA, df = 717; interaction, p < 0.0001, F =
18.98; Genotype, p < 0.0001, F = 25.14; age, p = 0.0323, F =
4.600). There was no significant difference in power distribution
in the gamma frequency range (35–55 Hz) for any groups. We
found no differences between groups at any age in theta- or
gamma-phase locked interneurons (data not shown).
Excitatory, but Not Inhibitory, Neurons Are Vulnerable in
Aged EC-Tau Mice
Significant neuronal loss was previously reported at 24 months
of age (but not at 21 months of age) in the EC-II and PaS of
EC-Tau mice compared to control mice (de Calignon et al.,
Neuron 93, 533–541, February 8, 2017
535
 2012). Consistent with this finding, we also found that the
number of neurons (NeuN+) in MEC-II (p = 0.0079) as well as
MEC-III/IV (p = 0.0018) was significantly reduced in 30+-month
EC-Tau mice compared to control mice (Figure S4A). Thioflavin
S+ tau, indicative of mature tangles, was only observed in
the EC and pre/parasubiculum (Figures S4B–S4D) at 24 and
34 months, with larger aggregates being observed at 34 months.
AT100 (a marker of AD-related hyperphosphorylated tau;
Matsuo et al., 1994) labeled a larger set of neurons than thioflavin
S at younger ages but co-localized with thioflavin S+ tau at 30+
months (Figures S4B–S4D). To identify which type of cell
accumulated pathological human tau, we performed sequential
staining with antibodies against human tau (MC1+), excitatory
neurons (TBR1+), and inhibitory neurons (PV+ or SOM+) (Belforte
et al., 2010) in 30+-month EC-Tau and control mice (Figure 4).
The MC1+-tau staining in the MEC was completely co-localized
with TBR1+ excitatory neurons, but not with PV+ or SOM+
inhibitory neurons (Figures 4A–4C and 4E). Furthermore, the
number of TBR1+ excitatory neurons was significantly reduced
in the MEC-II and MEC-III/IV in aged EC-Tau mice compared
to matched controls (p = 0.0022) (Figure 4D). However, there
was no difference in the number of PV+ or SOM+ inhibitory

Scale bars, 20 cm.
(A) Activity maps and autocorrelations were unchanged in the 14-month EC-Tau mice compared to controls.
(B) In contrast, activity maps and autocorrelations were severely affected in 30+-month EC-Tau mice when compared to age-matched controls. Numbers on top
and to the left of the activity maps indicate peak firing rate and recording depths from the surface of the brain, respectively. Numbers on top of the autocorrelation
maps indicate grid scores (GS).
(C) After applying an exclusion criterion of 95% (GS = 0.21) for shuffled grid scores, we found that grid cells from 30+-month EC-Tau mice exhibit significantly
reduced grid field periodicity compared to age-matched controls (30+-month EC-Tau mice, GS = 0.32, n = 26 grid cells; 30+-month control mice, GS = 0.53, n =
30 grid cells, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U, 143.5). The group-wise histograms of observed grid score percentages across 122 grid cells show that the distribution
for 30+-month EC-Tau cells was shifted toward lower scores compared to other groups.
(D) Peak firing rates and average firing rates of grid cells were reduced in 30+-month EC-Tau mice when compared to age-matched controls (peak firing: 30+-
month EC-Tau mice, 4.5 Hz, n = 26 grid cells; 30+-month control mice, 9.6 Hz, n = 30 grid cells, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U, 127.5; average firing: 30+-month EC-
Tau mice, 2.2 Hz, n = 26; 30+-month control mice, 3.7 Hz, n = 30 grid cells, p = 0.0161, Mann-Whitney U, 243.0). All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. See also

DISCUSSION
In this study, we demonstrated that in aged EC-Tau mice,
pathological human tau accumulated in the somatodendritic
compartment of cells in the hippocampal formation as well as
in hippocampus proper and neocortical regions, and this was
accompanied by spatial learning and memory deficits measured
by the MWM and T-maze tests. EC-Tau mice at 30+ months
were more impaired than controls at 30+ months, and mice
with more severe pathology at 30+ months were more impaired
than EC-Tau mice at 14 months, which were not different from
age-matched controls. At 30+ months of age, control mice
were impaired compared to control mice at 14 months, but the
EC-Tau mice at 30+ months showed a greater deficit compared
to 14-month EC-Tau mice. These results indicate that tau pathol-
ogy contributes more than age effects to the spatial learning and
memory deficits observed in aged EC-Tau mice.
Grid field size and grid field spacing have been shown to pro-
gressively increase along the MEC dorsoventral axis (Giocomo
et al., 2011). Interestingly, dorsal MEC appears to be selectively
vulnerable to pathological tau, and not ventral MEC, as shown by
a recent study (Booth et al., 2016). With these key findings in
mind, we targeted the dorsal MEC for in vivo recordings in our
young and aged cohorts. We found a significant reduction in
grid cell firing rates, grid scores, and spatial information content
in 30+-month EC-Tau mice, indicating impaired spatial repre-
sentation in this cohort, reminiscent of early AD. The increased
number of low grid scores observed in these aged mice was
not tied to low firing rates, as downsampling (2-fold) the data
from young mice—which exhibited the highest firing rates—did
not significantly affect grid scores (Figure S3B). Moreover, it
has been previously shown that grid scores and mean vector
length can both tolerate a high degree of downsampling without
affecting either measure (Bonnevie et al., 2013). The reduced
firing in excitatory grid cells and increased firing in inhibitory in-
terneurons likely result in increased inhibitory constraint within
the MEC, leading to enhanced power of theta, which is thought
to be driven by increased activity of inhibitory neurons (Stark
et al., 2013). Although grid cell periodicity is reduced by abolish-
ing theta rhythms when the medial septum is inactivated (Bran-
don et al., 2011), there might be additional mechanisms involved
that increase the power of theta in the EC-Tau mouse model. It is
possible that accumulation of tau specifically in MEC excitatory
neurons, combined with extensive neuronal loss, causes theta
to increase. The increase in theta power is consistent with
enhanced theta rhythm seen in mild cognitive impairment and
early AD (Jeong, 2004; Montez et al., 2009; Moretti et al., 2009;
Figure 3. Grid Cell Properties, Increased Interneuron Firing, and Enhanced Power of Theta in the Dorsal MEC of Aged EC-Tau Mice
(A) Left: information content in the grid cells of 30+-month EC-Tau mice was significantly reduced compared to age-matched controls (30+-month EC-Tau mice,
Skaggs information content, 1.254, n = 26 grid cells; 30+-month control mice, Skaggs information content, 1.706, n = 30 grid cells, p < 0.0001, Mann-Whitney U,
146.5). Right: there was no difference in grid cell spatial coherence in either group.
(B) Putative interneurons show no difference in peak firing rates in mice at any age or genotype. However, interneurons of 30+-month EC-Tau mice show
increased average firing rates compared to age-matched controls (30+-month EC-Tau mice, 27.7 Hz, n = 22 interneurons; 30+-month control mice, 17.66 Hz, n =
22 interneurons, p = 0.0193, Mann-Whitney U, 142.5), while there was no difference in average firing rates in 14-month animals.
(C and D) Local field potentials (LFPs) were recorded from the MEC of (C) 14- and (D) 30+-month mice.
(E) Power distributions of LFPs in both 14- and 30+-month mice are shown. The power in the theta range was significantly greater in 30+-month EC-Tau mice
compared to age-matched controls and 14-month groups. All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. **p < 0.01 (two-way ANOVA).

 Siwek et al., 2015; Stam, 2010). We hypothesize that mature tau-
opathy mainly affects excitatory neurons but spares inhibitory
neurons, causing cell death in the former and altering network
activity.
Based on the altered firing properties of grid cells, inhibitory
neurons, and neural oscillations observed in aged EC-Tau
mice, we propose that the accumulation of mature tangles
may disturb the balance between excitatory and inhibitory
neurons. NFTs have been identified in human AD brain in cells
that, based on their morphology and location, were proposed
to be excitatory (Hof et al., 2003). In order to investigate
whether
excitatory
or
inhibitory
neurons
are
vulnerable
to tau pathology, we first counted the number of total neurons
in aged EC-Tau mice. The number of total neurons (NeuN+) in
MEC-II as well as MEC-III/IV was significantly reduced in 30+-
month EC-Tau mice compared to control mice. This is
consistent
with
a
previous
finding
on
this
mouse
line
that significant neuronal loss was reported at 24 months of
age (but not at 21 months of age) in the EC-II and PaS
of EC-Tau mice compared to control mice (de Calignon
et al., 2012). Thioflavin S+ tau, indicative of mature tangles,
was only observed in the EC and pre/parasubiculum at
24 and 34 months, with larger aggregates being observed
at 34 months. This suggests that overt cell death is only
associated
with
mature
tangles,
although
synapse
loss
and altered neuronal activity have been reported in the
hippocampal regions in younger EC-Tau mice (de Calignon
et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2012; Polydoro et al., 2014). To
identify whether tau-positive cells were excitatory or inhibi-
tory, we performed immunohistochemistry co-localization
studies. MC1+-tau staining in the MEC was completely co-
localized with TBR1+ excitatory neurons, but not with PV+ or
SOM+ inhibitory neurons. Further, the number of TBR1+ excit-
atory neurons was significantly reduced in the MEC-II and
MEC-III/IV in aged EC-Tau mice compared to matched
controls. However, there was no difference in the number
of PV+ or SOM+ inhibitory neurons between aged EC-Tau
and control mice. These results suggest that pathological
tau differentially impairs excitatory neurons compared to
inhibitory neurons, which could cause the hypoexcitability
observed in the MEC, resulting in destabilized grid fields.
Taken together, we have demonstrated that mature tau pa-
thology in aged EC-Tau mice leads to excitatory cell loss in the
MEC, grid cell dysfunction, and alterations in cell firing proper-
ties. While it is not possible to directly link these deficits in the
MEC to the spatial memory deficits seen in aged EC-Tau mice
due to pathology occurring in other regions in addition to the
MEC, it is clear that tau pathology can cause spatial navigation
deficits, which could explain the disorientation and navigation
deficits seen in early human AD.

Figure 4. The Number of Excitatory Neurons, but Not Inhibitory Neurons, Is Reduced in Aged EC-Tau Mice
(A–C) Sections from 30+-month EC-Tau mice and age-matched controls were subjected to sequential staining with TBR1 (an excitatory neuronal marker) (A),
parvalbumin (PV, an inhibitory neuronal marker) (B), or somatostatin (SOM, an inhibitory neuronal marker) (C) antibody, followed by incubation with the MC1 tau
antibody. Scale bar, 100 mm.
(D) The number of TBR1+ excitatory neurons, but not PV+ or SOM+ inhibitory neurons, was significantly reduced in MEC layers II and III/IV of 30+-month EC-
Tau mice (n = 8) compared to age-matched controls (n = 8). All data are expressed as mean ± SEM. **p < 0.01 versus control (non-parametric Mann-Whitney
U test).
(E) Tau protein co-localized with excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons, in the MEC of aged EC-Tau mice. Sections were subjected to sequential
staining with TBR1, parvalbumin (PV), or somatostatin (SOM) antibody, followed by incubation with MC1 tau antibody. MC1+ tau staining was exclusively co-
localized with TBR1+ excitatory neurons, but not PV+ or SOM+ inhibitory neurons, in the MEC of 30+-month EC-Tau mice (n = 4). Scale bar, 40 mm. See also

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
We previously generated the line of tau transgenic mice known as EC-Tau (previously known as Neuropsin-tTA-Tau or NT; genotype:
Tg(Klk8-tTA)SMmay/MullMmmh Tg(tetO-MAPT*P301L)#Kha/JlwsJ; strain background: FVB/N:C57BL/6) (Liu et al., 2012; Khan
et al., 2014) by crossing the neuropsin-tTA ‘‘activator’’ line (genotype: Tg(Klk8-tTA)SMmay/MullMmmh; strain background:
congenic on C57BL/6 background) (Yasuda and Mayford, 2006) with a tetracycline-inducible ‘‘responder’’ line (genotype:
Tg(tetO-MAPT*P301L)#Kha/JlwsJ; strain background: FVB/N background) (Santacruz et al., 2005). The F1 offspring (both males
and females, EC-Tau genotype or controls (non-transgenic littermates from the EC-tau cross), strain FVB/N:C57BL/6) were used
as experimental animals. All animals were maintained on a 12 hr light/dark cycle with food and water provided ad libitum. All animal
experiments were performed in accordance with national guidelines (National Institutes of Health) and approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee of Columbia University. The behavior tests were performed with two separate cohorts of naive mice
at 14 months and 30+ months of age during the light phase; neuronal activity was also recorded during the light phase. At each age,
T-maze was performed first, followed by Morris water maze (MWM) two weeks later. If the animals died or were sick during, or before
the final test, they were removed from the data analysis.
METHOD DETAILS
Immunohistochemistry
Mice were transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (Fisher Scientific), brains were harvested and drop-fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) (Electron Microscopy Sciences) in PBS at 4�C overnight, followed by incubation in 30% sucrose

 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS until the brains sank to the bottom of the container. Brains were sectioned (35 mm) throughout on a horizontal
plane with a cryostat (Leica CM3050S, Leica Biosystems), and collected in individual wells. Representative free-floating sections
from EC-Tau and littermate control mice at 30+ month of age were stained with human specific, anti-tau antibodies MC1 or CP27
(courtesy of Dr. Peter Davies; 1:500), mouse/human AT8 or AT180 (Thermo Scientific; 1:500). In addition, every 9th free-floating sec-
tions from 30+ mo EC-Tau and control mice (n = 5 mice per group, 10 sections each mouse) starting from Bregma �2.04 mm to
Bregma �4.88 mm were selected and stained with mouse NeuN antibody (EMD Millipore; 1:1000), which is a specific neuronal
marker.
Immunostaining was performed as previously described (Liu et al., 2012; Khan et al., 2014). In brief, free-floating mouse brain sec-
tions were blocked in 1.5% H2O2 (Fisher Scientific) in PBS for 10 min, and incubated with the above appropriate primary antibody in
PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) (PBST) and 5% normal goat serum (Vector Laboratories) at 4�C overnight. After
three washes with PBST, the sections were incubated with SuperPicture horseradish peroxidase (HRP) polymer conjugate Broad
spectrum (Invitrogen) for 15 min at room temperature on a rotator. Following three washes with PBS, immunoreactive material
was visualized using 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) (Sigma-Aldrich) as chromagen. The stained sections were
mounted on slides and inspected by light microscopy (Olympus BX50, Olympus).
A semiquantitative count of NeuN-positive neurons in the EC-II and EC-III/IV was performed in selected sections from 5 control and
5 EC-Tau mice. For each mouse, a total of 10 NeuN-stained horizontal sections starting from Bregma �2.04 mm, spaced at �300 mm,
were included for automated cell counting (http://imagej.net/Particle_Analysis) using the ImageJ software (version 1.48, NIH).
Morris water maze (MWM) tests
Spatial learning and memory was assessed using the MWM test including hidden platform acquisition and probe trial test. All the
tests were automated and recorded using ANY-maze video tracking software (Stoelting Co.). Briefly, mice (n = 10 controls and 9
EC-Tau mice at 14 mo; n = 7 controls and 7 EC-Tau mice at 30+ mo) were tested in a cylindrical tank of 120 cm in diameter and
60 cm in height. The tank was filled with water at around 25�C made opaque by adding Palmer Prism tempera white paint (Palmer
Paint Products) until the platform was submerged 1.5 cm below the water surface. The tank was divided into four quadrants with
different navigation landmarks for each quadrant. The midpoint of the wall in each quadrant was used as the starting location
from where animals were released into the water.
In the hidden platform acquisition test, mice were allowed to swim freely to search for the escape platform within a maximum of
60 s. The platform location remained constant throughout the test. The time taken to reach the platform was recorded as the escape
latency. The mouse was kept on the platform for 10 s after it found the hidden platform. If a mouse failed to find the platform within
60 s, it was guided to the platform and placed on the platform for 10 s; in this case, the escape latency was recorded as 60 s for this
trial. The same animal was released from a new starting quadrant 4 min after the previous trial. The experiment was repeated with 6
trials per mouse each day and 4 consecutive days. The mean escape latency was measured to evaluate the spatial learning ability.
Two hours and twenty-four hours after the hidden platform acquisition test, probe trials were conducted by removing the platform.
Mice were placed in the diagonal quadrant of the hidden platform originally located and were allowed to swim freely in the pool for
60 s. The number of entries into the area around the original hidden platform, i.e., the number of crossings over the previous platform
location, was used to indicate the short-term and long-term memory maintenance.
At the end of the 24 hr probe trial, a colorful flag was placed on the top of the hidden platform, which was opposite to the testing
quadrant. The mouse was released at three different quadrants, and the time spent to find the flag was recorded as a measure of
visual ability. All of the MWM tests were performed by two experienced technicians who were blind to the genotype of the animals.
T-maze spontaneous alternation
Mice (n = 10 controls and 9 EC-Tau mice at 14 mo; n = 8 controls and 8 EC-Tau mice at 30 mo) were tested for spontaneous alter-
nation on a T-shaped maze as previously described (Deacon and Rawlins, 2006). We used a spatial T-maze which had a black cue
card on the left side of the stem. After one-day habituation, mice were first placed at the stem of the T-maze [measured 40 (stem) x 46
(arm) x 10 (width) cm] and allowed to choose to explore one open goal arm of the maze for 30 s throughout a twelve-trial continuous
alternation sessions. Once a goal arm was chosen, the mouse was placed in the stem of the maze again, facing away from the goal
arms, and the trial was repeated. The inside of the T-maze was wiped with 70% ethanol between different animal trials. For each
animal, number of correct and incorrect choices were recorded in a contingency table. At the end of the experiment chi-square
test was done to test statistical significance. All the tests were recorded by a technician blind to the genotype of the animals.
Electrode implantation and surgery
Custom-made, reusable 16-channel microdrives (Axona, UK) were constructed as described previously by attaching an inner (23 ga)
and an outer (19 ga) stainless steel cannula to the microdrives (Hussaini et al., 2011). Tetrodes were built by twisting four 25 mm thick
platinum-iridium wires (California wires) and heat bonding them. Four such tetrodes were inserted into the inner cannula of the micro-
drive and connected to the wires of the microdrive. One day prior to surgery, the tetrodes were cut to an appropriate length and plated
with a platinum/gold solution until the impedance dropped to about 150 ohms. On the day of surgery, mice were anesthetized with a
mixture of ketamine and xylazine (100 mg/ml and 15 mg/ml, respectively, per 10 g body weight) and monitored for depth of anes-
thesia before proceeding. Mice were then fixed within the stereotaxic frame with the use of zygomatic process cuff holders and

 an incision was made to expose the skull. About 3–4 jeweler’s screws were inserted into the skull to support the microdrive implant.
An additional screw connected with wire was also inserted into the skull which served as a ground/reference for local field potential
(LFP) recordings. A 2 mm hole was made on the skull at position 3.1 mm lateral to lambda and �0.2 mm in front of the transverse
sinus. Tetrodes were then lowered to about 0.8 mm from the surface of the brain (below dura) at an angle of 6-8� in the posterior
direction in the sagittal plane. Dental cement was spread across the exposed skull and secured with the microdrive. Mice were
allowed to recover from anesthesia in a cleaned cage placed on a warm heating pad until awake (�45 min) before finally being trans-
ported to housing. Carprofen (5 mg/kg) was administered to mice prior to surgery and post-operatively to reduce pain. Mice usually
recovered within 24 hr, after which the tetrodes were lowered and recording began. All recording depths reported are from the
surface of the brain.
In vivo recording and cell classification
The mice explored four alternating arenas during recording sessions: three white boxes (Box 1: 45 3 45 cm; Box 2: 55 3 55 cm; Box 3:
70 3 70 cm) or a white cylinder (dia. 70 cm). Twenty nine mice underwent two recording sessions per day, with R 4 hr between ses-
sions. For each new recording session, mice were exposed to either 1) a different arena than the previous session, or 2) the same
arena as the previous session, but with the arena and visual cue rotated. Tetrode positions were moved not more than 50mm at a
time, and only after the last recording session of the day, allowing > 12 hr of stable electrode positioning prior to the next recording
session. All mice included in our study underwent R 16 recording sessions, with the 30+ mo EC-Tau group having the highest num-
ber of sessions (1.3X more than age-matched control) to obtain similar overall cell numbers. Neuronal signals from experimental mice
were recorded using the Axona DacqUSB system. The signals were amplified 15,000 to 30,000 times and band pass filtered between
0.8 and 6.7 kHz. LFP was recorded from 4 channels of the electrodes. The LFP was amplified 15,000 times, lowpass filtered at 125 Hz
and sampled at 250 Hz. Notch filter was used to eliminate 60 Hz noise. The recording system tracked the position of the infrared LED
on the head stage (sampling rate 50 Hz) by means of an overhead video camera. Position data were speed-filtered, only speeds of
3 cm/s or more were included. Tracking artifacts were removed by deleting samples greater than 100 cm/s and missing positions
were interpolated with total durations less than 1 s, and then smoothing the path with a 21-sample boxcar window filter (400 ms;
10 samples on each side). Spike sorting was performed offline using TINT cluster-cutting software and Klustakwik automated clus-
tering tool (Figure S2). The resulting clusters were further refined manually and were validated using autocorrelation and cross-cor-
relation functions as additional separation tools. Quantitative measurements of cluster quality were subsequently performed, yielding
isolation Distances in Mahalanobis space (Schmitzer-Torbert et al., 2005). There were no significant differences between clusters
in our experimental groups (Median Isolation distances: 30+-mo EC-Tau- 10.40, 30+-mo control- 10.10, 14-mo EC-Tau- 9.46 and
14-mo control- 10.50. Kruskal-Wallis test- p = 0.334). A total of 434 excitatory neurons (122 grid cells, 93 head-direction (HD) cells,
22 border cells and 197 non-classified (NC) cells) and 93 interneurons were recorded from 29 mice for this study. There were four
groups of mice and cell types for each group is as follows. Six 30+-mo EC-tau mice (26 grid; 26 HD; 5 border; 36 NC cells; and
22 interneurons), six 30+-mo control mice (30 grid; 15 HD; 7; border; 40 NC cells; and 22 interneurons), nine 14-mo old EC-tau
mice (36 grid; 32 HD; 6 border; 78 NC cells; and 22 interneurons) and eight 14-mo old control mice (30 grid; 20 HD; 4 border;
43 NC cells; and 27 interneurons). There was no significant difference between the number of cells recorded within the two
age groups. t test between 30+-mo EC-Tau versus 30+-mo Control group: Grid cell- p = 0.6658, t = 0.4450, df = 10; Head-direction
cells- p = 0.2198, t = 1.309, df = 10; Border cells- p = 0.4608, t = 0.7670, df = 10; Interneurons- p = 1, t = 0.000, df = 10 and NC cells-
p = 0.6658, t = 0.4450, df = 10. t test between 14-mo EC-Tau versus 14-mo Control group: Grid cell- p = 0.8664, t = 0.712, df = 15;
Head-direction cells- p = 0.4228, t = 0.8241, df = 15; Border cells- p = 0.6804, t = 0.4201, df = 15; Interneurons- p = 0.4366, t = 0.7993,
df = 15 and Mann Whitney U test for NC cells- p = 0.3836, U = 26.50. Also, relative proportion of interneurons with respect
to other excitatory cell types was not significantly different for 30+-mo group (EC-Tau: 19.84% and Control: 20.50%, T-test:
p = 0.8772, t = 0.1586, df = 10) and 14-mo group (EC-Tau: 17.29% and Control: 22.73%, T-test: p = 0.4650, t = 0.498, df = 15).
Note that the relative proportion of cells are the same across groups after increased recording sessions in the 30+ EC-Tau group.
Head direction and border cells were identified as described previously (Bonnevie et al., 2013; Langston et al., 2010). Cells were clas-
sified as head-direction cells if they preferentially displayed tuning toward a particular direction in polar plots, while border cells were
identified by their characteristic firing fields in the proximity of an environmental boundary. All other MEC cells sampled that did not
exhibit spatial preference or directional tuning were identified as non-classified cells. Putative excitatory cells were distinguished
from putative interneurons based on waveform width (> 350 ms) and firing rate (< 30 Hz).
Grid cell analysis and local field potentials
Firing rate distributions were determined by counting the number of spikes in each 2.5 cm 3 2.5 cm bin as well as the time spent per
bin. Maps for number of spikes and time were smoothed individually using a quasi-Gaussian kernel over the surrounding 5 3 5 bins.
Analysis of grid cells was done as described previously (Bonnevie et al., 2013; Langston et al., 2010). Firing rates were determined by
dividing spike number and time for each bin of the two smoothed maps. The peak rate was defined as the rate in the bin with the
highest rate in the firing rate map. The structure of the rate maps was evaluated for all cells with more than 100 spikes by calculating
the spatial autocorrelation for each smoothed rate map. The degree of spatial periodicity (grid scores) was determined for each

 recorded cell by taking a circular sample of the autocorrelogram, centered on the central peak but with the central peak excluded,
and comparing rotated versions of this sample. Only cells that yielded positive grid scores were used for further analysis. To break the
correlation between the firing pattern and animal’s position, the data was shuffled 100 times by randomly shifting the spike times of
each grid cell less than 20 s or more than 20 s relative to animal’s position. Shuffling was done on the entire population of putative grid
cells in the same age group and the same brain region (Figure S3A). Grid cells were defined as cells in which rotational symmetry
based grid scores exceeded the 95th percentile of a distribution of grid scores for shuffled data. Out of 170 putative grid cells
only 122 cells exceeded the 95th percentile criteria of 0.21. 76.9% of 14-mo control, 73.5% of 14-mo EC-Tau, 73% of 30+-mo control
and 64% of 30+-mo EC-Tau cells passed the 0.21 threshold. Information content and spatial coherence was calculated as described
previously (Hussaini et al., 2011). Spatial coherence estimates smoothness of a place field. It was calculated by correlating the firing
rate in each pixel with firing rates averaged with its neighboring 8 pixels. It measures the extent to which the firing rate in a pixel is
predicted by the rates in its neighbors (Muller and Kubie, 1989). Abrupt changes in firing rates of neighboring pixels make the place
fields incoherent. Spatial information content is a measure used to predict the location of an animal from the firing of a cell. Informa-
tion content was calculated using Skaggs’ formula (Skaggs et al., 1993) and measures the amount of information carried by a single
spike about the location of the animal and is expressed as bits per spike:

where i is the bin/pixel number, Pi is the probability for occupancy of bin i, Ri is the mean firing rate for bin/pixel i and R is the overall
firing mean rate. Head direction and border cells were identified as described previously (Bonnevie et al., 2013; Langston et al., 2010).
Analysis of LFPs was done using EEGLAB (a toolbox for MATLAB) (Delorme and Makeig, 2004). Briefly, log mean spectra of LFPs
were calculated and percent distribution of power was calculated for theta (4-12 Hz) and gamma (35-55 Hz) frequency range (Hus-
saini et al., 2011). LFP analysis was speed filtered between 5-25 cm/sec to exclude speed related theta or gamma increase. There
was no significant difference between the overall running speeds of control mice versus the EC-Tau mice (data not shown). After the
recording experiments were complete, all surviving animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused with 4% PFA solution. The brains
were then extracted, placed in 4% PFA solution and shaken for 24 hr at 4�C. The following day the brains were transferred to 30%
sucrose solution and shaken at 4�C until they sunk to the bottom of the tube. Brains were frozen and sectioned (30 mm) using a cryo-
stat and processed further for either immunohistochemistry (explained below) or to identify tetrode tracts where visible, into the MEC
(Figures S3C and S3D).
Immunofluorescence
Free-floating brain sections were prepared in the same way as for immunohistochemistry. Sections (2 sections with 100 mm intervals
from each mouse) were blocked in PBST containing 5% normal goat serum for 30 min at room temperature, and incubated with rabbit
anti-TBR1 (Abcam; 1:500), rabbit anti-Parvalbumin (Thermo Scientific; 1:2000) or rat anti-Somatostatin (EMD Millipore; 1:100) anti-
body in PBST containing 5% normal goat serum at 4�C overnight. After three washes with PBST, the sections were incubated with
Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit or Alexa Fluor 647 goat anti-rat IgG (Life Technologies; 1:1000) for 1 hr at room temperature on a
rotator. After three washes with PBST, the sections were blocked and incubated with antibody MC1 (1:1000) in PBST containing
5% normal goat serum at 4�C overnight. After three washes with PBST, the sections were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488 goat
anti-mouse IgG (Life Technologies; 1:1000) for 1 hr at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, autofluorescence
was quenched with 0.3% Sudan black in 70% ethanol (Decon Laboratories) for 6 min at room temperature. The sections were rinsed
with 70% ethanol and washed three times with 0.02% Tween-20 in PBS. The nuclei were stained with 5 mg/ml Hoechst33342 (Sigma-
Aldrich) in PBST for 10 min at room temperature. Following three washes with PBS, sections were mounted on slides using SlowFade
gold anti-fade reagent and imaged using confocal laser scanning microscopy via Z stack. The number of TBR1+, PV+ or SOM+ neu-
rons in the MEC was quantified automatically using ImageJ.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Prism 4 software (GraphPad) was used to analyze the data. All the data are expressed as mean ± SEM. We performed the D’Agostino
& Pearson omnibus normality test to determine if the data was normally distributed. We then chose the following statistical tests. A
two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni post-tests was used to compare the escape latency and swim speed in 4 days
of continuous hidden platform trials in MWM, as well as to compare power distributions of LFPs. The unpaired t test was used to
compare the number of platform crossings in 2 hr and 24 hr probe trials in the MWM. We used the Kruskal-Wallis test to compare
median isolation distances in all groups for cluster quality. A Chi-square test was used to compare the binary data from the
T-maze test. The non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare: the number of NeuN+ and TBR1+/PV+/SOM+ neurons,
visual ability, and body weight, as well as all single-unit recording data. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant for
all measures. The ‘‘n’’ represents the number of animals in each group, unless specified otherwise. The exact values of n are indicated
in figure legends, supplemental figure legends, and in the Method Details section.
