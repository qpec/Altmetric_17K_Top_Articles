Epigenetic modifications, such as DNA cytosine methylation, contribute to the mechanisms underlying
learning and memory by coordinating adaptive gene expression and neuronal plasticity. Transcription-
dependent plasticity regulated by DNA methylation includes synaptic plasticity and homeostatic synaptic
scaling. Memory-related plasticity also includes alterations in intrinsic membrane excitability mediated by
changes in the abundance or activity of ion channels in the plasma membrane, which sets the threshold
for action potential generation. We found that prolonged inhibition of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) activity
increased intrinsic membrane excitability of cultured cortical pyramidal neurons. Knockdown of the cytosine
demethylase TET1 or inhibition of RNA polymerase blocked the increased membrane excitability caused by
DNMT inhibition, suggesting that this effect was mediated by subsequent cytosine demethylation and de
novo transcription. Prolonged DNMT inhibition blunted the medium component of the after-hyperpolarization
potential, an effect that would increase neuronal excitability, and was associated with reduced expression
of the genes encoding small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels. Furthermore, the specific SK
channel blocker apamin increased neuronal excitability but was ineffective after DNMT inhibition. Our
results suggested that DNMT inhibition enables transcriptional changes that culminate in decreased ex-
pression of SK channel–encoding genes and decreased activity of SK channels, thus providing a mech-
anism for the regulation of neuronal intrinsic membrane excitability by dynamic DNA cytosine
methylation. This study has implications for human neurological and psychiatric diseases associated with
dysregulated intrinsic excitability.
INTRODUCTION
Mammalian learning and memory depend on activity-regulated neuro-
nal plasticity. In response to external stimuli, neurons within memory-
related networks in the adult central nervous system respond with
patterns of activity that relay and encode information. Subsequently,
alterations in synaptic strength and membrane excitability modify and
shape neuronal connectivity and thus contribute to the integration and stor-
age of experiential information (1–4). Fundamental to these processes is
the adaptive regulation of gene expression (5, 6). In the context of devel-
opment and differentiation, the cellular programs orchestrating the tran-
scriptome are centered at the level of the nucleus, particularly in the
regulation of chromatin structure through epigenetic modifications (7, 8).
In the adult central nervous system, considerable evidence now supports
a role for epigenetic modifications in learning and memory (9) and neu-
ropsychiatric disorders (9, 10).
Once regarded as irreversible in postmitotic cells, DNA cytosine
methylation has emerged as a dynamic epigenetic modification in adult
neurons. In neurons, cytosines throughout the genome are differentially
methylated and demethylated in response to activity and behavioral
stimulation (9, 11–13). As in other cell types, the forward process of cy-
tosine methylation is catalyzed by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) (14)
and most commonly occurs at cytosines followed by a guanine residue,
referred to as CpG sites (15). DNMTs, predominantly DNMT3A and
DNMT1, are abundant in postmitotic neurons. DNMT3A methylates
cytosines on a single DNA strand, such as previously unmethylated
CpG sites, and is thus called a de novo DNMT. DNMT1 recognizes
methylated CpG sites on a single strand, subsequently methylates cyto-
sines on the opposite strand, and is thus called “a maintenance” DNMT
(16, 17). Experience stimulates DNMT
-mediated conversion of cytosine
to 5-methylcytosine, and this conversion is implicated in memory-related
neuronal plasticity in brain regions such as hippocampus (12, 18–20),
cortex (21), and midbrain (22, 23). Furthermore, pharmacological inhi-
bition of DNMT activity (henceforth referred to as DNMTi) and genetic
knockout of both Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a disrupt memory function in the
adult rodent (19–22). The reverse process, DNA demethylation, occurs
through an array of enzymatic reactions initiated by the ten-eleven trans-
location (TET) family–mediated oxidation of 5-methylcytosine to 5-
hydroxymethylcytosine. Active DNA demethylation is also induced by
experience and neuronal activity and is necessary for memory formation
(13, 24–26). Collectively, these lines of evidence argue that in the behav-
ing animal, DNA cytosine methylation represents a core epigenetic mech-
anism that promotes the incorporation of experiential information in a
persistent yet flexible manner.
On the cellular level, activity-regulated DNA methylation contributes
to memory-related synaptic plasticity. In rodents, strong membrane de-
polarization (27, 28) and synaptic activity (29) decrease promoter methyl-
ation and increase expression of the plasticity-promoting gene brain-
derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf ). In hippocampal (30) and cortical (31)
slice preparations, DNMTi blocks the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
receptor–dependent, long-term potentiation of excitatory synapses and
alters the methylation status of Bdnf and another plasticity-promoting
gene, reelin (Reln). Additionally, hippocampal long-term potentiation
is impaired and long-term depression is enhanced in mice with genetic
forebrain deletion of Dnmt1 and Dnmt3a (20).

 Active cytosine methylation also contributes to memory-related
changes in synaptic strength by regulating synaptic scaling, a form
of homeostatic plasticity involving cell-wide alterations in the abun-
dance of postsynaptic receptors that occurs in response to chronic
changes in neuronal activity (32–34). In cultured pyramidal neurons,
inhibiting neuronal activity with tetrodotoxin (TTX) alters DNA cy-
tosine methylation and differentially affects the expression of genes
encoding proteins involved in demethylation (33, 34). Moreover,
DNMTi and DNMT knockdown in cortical pyramidal cells (34)
and TET3 knockdown in hippocampal pyramidal cells (33) induce
a cell-wide increase in synaptic strength through the upscaling of glu-
tamatergic synapses.
A functional link between DNA methylation and the excitability of
the neuronal membrane remains an open question, however. Although
synaptic activity mediates input of information within neuronal net-
works, the output of individual cells is ultimately conveyed by action
potentials (APs). A neuron’s propensity for generating an AP from a
given input is referred to as its intrinsic membrane excitability (IME).
Both passive and active membrane properties determine IME. Passive
properties, such as membrane capacitance, input resistance, and rest-
ing membrane potential, are primarily determined by cellular morphology
and the presence or absence of ion channels in the plasma membrane
that are open at rest, also known as leak channels. The active proper-
ties of the neuronal membrane are determined by the abundance,
spatial distribution, and activity of voltage-gated and Ca2+-activated
ion channels.
Memory-related changes in IME, termed intrinsic plasticity, pre-
dominantly occur through alterations in active neuronal membrane prop-
erties (4). Intrinsic plasticity occurs in response to a broad range of
behavioral stimuli in neurons within the hippocampus (35–47) and cortex
(48–52) and is thus activity-dependent.
Additionally, intrinsic plasticity may
contribute to learning-related processes
as a form of homeostatic plasticity that
occurs in response to chronic changes in
neuronal activity (2, 53–55). Ultimately,
intrinsic plasticity mediated by a behav-
ioral experience is thought to subsequent-
ly modulate the acquisition of new
memories (47, 50), a process known as
metaplasticity (3, 56, 57). Although in-
trinsic plasticity is transcriptionally regu-
lated (54, 55, 58, 59), it is unclear whether
epigenetic mechanisms are involved.
Given the role of DNA methylation in
learning and memory and the extent of ge-
nomic cytosines in neurons that may po-
tentially be affected by activity-regulated
methylation changes, DNA methylation
may regulate adaptations in both synaptic
strength and membrane excitability. In
parallel to its regulatory contribution to
synaptic plasticity and homeostatic syn-
aptic scaling, DNA methylation might
modulate the flowof information through-
out memory-related networks by fine-
tuning the IME of individual neurons.
Therefore, we investigated whether there
is a role of DNMT activity in regulating
the IME of cortical pyramidal neurons.
RESULTS
Prolonged DNMT inhibition increases IME
In our initial experiments, we used a pharmacological DNMTi, the small-
molecule competitive antagonist RG108, to examine the role of DNMT
activity in regulating the IME of cultured rat cortical pyramidal neu-
rons. After a 24-hour exposure to 100 mM RG108, we performed whole-
cell current-clamp electrophysiology of visually identified pyramidal
neurons. Current-clamp recordings enabled the measurement of
membrane potential both at rest and in response to intracellular injec-
tions of current. RG108 induced a hyperpolarization of the resting
membrane potential (Fig. 1A and Table 1), suggesting a change in the
ionic currents open at rest. However, RG108 did not affect whole-cell
capacitance (Table 1), input resistance (Fig. 1A and Table 1), or the
membrane time constant of recorded cells (Table 1), which indicated
that passive neuronal properties were largely unaffected by this phar-
macological DNMTi.
To assess active neuronal membrane properties, we injected 500-ms-long
depolarizing current pulses of increasing amplitude into the neuronal
soma. The membrane potential for all neurons was adjusted to −60 mV
between each 500-ms current pulse to control for alterations in resting
membrane potential induced by RG108. In cells from both the control
and RG108-exposed groups, stronger depolarization resulted in an in-
creased number of evoked APs and an increased rate of AP firing (Fig.
1B). However, neurons exposed to RG108 displayed an increased IME
as indicated by an increased evoked AP frequency over the range of
delivered current injections (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that in-
hibition of ongoing DNA cytosine methylation affects the active mem-
brane properties that regulate the input-output relationships and
repetitive AP firing behavior of individual cortical pyramidal neurons.

 The increased IME observed with DNMTi is consistent with the hypothesis
that DNA cytosine methylation regulates the abundance, membrane
distribution, or activity of voltage-gated or Ca2+-activated ion channels,
either through direct or indirect transcriptional control of the genes en-
coding the ion channel subunits or by changing the expression of genes
encoding enzymes that alter ion channel activity through posttrans-
lational modifications.
DNMTi-enhanced IME requires signaling through
NMDA receptors
Experience-induced and homeostatic intrinsic plasticity depends on sig-
naling through the NMDA type of glutamate receptors (54, 55, 60–64).
Therefore, we examined the underlying neuronal activity required for
the increased IME caused by DNMTi. We used 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-
1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) to antago-
nize AMPA-type glutamate receptors and D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric
acid (APV) NMDA-type glutamate receptors; we used TTX to suppress
Na+ channel–dependent AP generation. Cultured cortical neurons were
exposed to RG108 in the presence of APV
, APV + NBQX, or TTX. At
24 hours, we measured neuronal passive membrane properties in the
absence of pharmacological blockers. Exposure to RG108 + APV
,
RG108 + APV + NBQX, or RG108 + TTX did not affect passive mem-
brane properties (Table 1) or AP firing frequencies over a range of somatic
current injections (Fig. 2, A and B). Together, these results indicated that
the enhanced IME driven by inhibition of DNA cytosine methylation re-
quires neuronal activity. Furthermore, because the inhibition of NMDA
receptors alone with APV blocked DNMTi-mediated changes in IME,
our results indicated a role for glutamatergic signaling through NMDA
receptors and subsequent Ca2+ influx.

 DNMTi-enhanced IME depends on gene expression and
TET1-mediated DNA demethylation
NMDA receptor–mediated Ca2+-dependent signaling is critical for the
transcriptional regulation of both learning-related synaptic plasticity and
intrinsic plasticity (6, 54, 65–68). Furthermore, pharmacological DNMTi
blocks NMDA receptor–dependent changes in gene expression and
promoter methylation in slice preparations (30, 31) and in the behaving
animal (19, 22, 69). Because DNMTi-enhanced IME required NMDA
receptor–mediated signaling (Fig. 2) and because DNA methylation
regulates gene expression (12, 70, 71), we hypothesized that gene ex-
pression is necessary for IME. To initially address this question, we
exposed cultured cortical neurons to RG108 in the presence of the
broadly acting transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D. In pyramidal cells,
combined exposure to RG108 and actinomycin D did not affect passive
membrane properties (Table 1) or the rate of repetitive AP firing evoked
by somatic current pulses (Fig. 3, A and B). These results showed that
DNMTi-enhanced IME requires de novo transcription.
DNA methylation, particularly within gene promoter regions, is
considered suppressive of transcription (70). Therefore, we examined
whether DNMTi changed gene expression and IME through cytosine
demethylation using an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)–targeted ap-
proach to knock down the expression of the Tet1 gene. The dioxygen-
ase TET1 mediates neuronal activity–induced cytosine demethylation and
associated alterations in gene expression (13, 24, 26). Previously, we used
ASOs delivered to cultured neurons without transfection reagents and
showed specific transcript knockdown that persisted a week after a single
dose (34). Here, we found a selective ASO-mediated knockdown of Tet1
mRNA, with no effect on Tet2 or Tet3 mRNA abundance (Fig. 3C). Six to
7 days after a single ASO dose, cultured cortical neurons were exposed for
24 hours to RG108. In neurons with the Tet1-specific ASO, RG108 did
not affect passive membrane properties (Table 1) and did not change
evoked AP firing rates (Fig. 3, D and E). These results indicated that
the effect of DNMTi on IME depends on secondary TET1-mediated cy-
tosine demethylation. Together, our results implied that changes in cyto-
sine methylation are sufficient to regulate the expression of voltage- and
Ca2+-dependent channels or their associated modifiers and control IME.
To further support this interpretation, we preformed post hoc analy-
ses of publicly available RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data from a study
that used short hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated TET3 knockdown in
cultured mouse hippocampal cells (33). These data showed a role for
DNA demethylation in the transcriptional regulation of genes encoding
proteins involved in synapse structure and synaptic activity. However,
whether TET3 knockdown altered the expression of genes encoding
ion channels related to IME was not specifically examined. Here, we
hypothesized that TET3 knockdown–induced changes in DNA methyl-
ation would also alter the expression of genes encoding voltage-gated
and Ca2+-activated ion channels. Notably, a gene set enrichment anal-
ysis (72–75) of differentially repressed genes in control versus TET3
knockdown neurons revealed a significant overrepresentation of genes
ascribed with ion channel activity, specifically voltage-gated K+ chan-
nels (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, all subfamilies of K+ channels had specif-
ic differentially expressed ion channel–encoding genes (Fig. 4B),
including, but not limited to, those encoding Ca2+-activated K+ chan-
nels, delayed rectifier K+ channels, and the a and b subunits of voltage-
gated K+ channels, both of which regulate the activity of their cognate
pore-forming subunits. In addition, TET3 knockdown altered the ex-
pression of genes encoding both voltage-gated Na+ and voltage-gated
Ca2+ channels (Fig. 4, C and D). These observations highlight the tran-
scriptional potential of cytosine methylation to broadly regulate the ex-
pression of genes encoding ion channels that govern neuronal IME.
DNMTi reduces the voltage threshold and decreases the
mAHP of single APs
In the rat neocortex, neurons that have overlapping expression patterns
of genes encoding ion channels have similar electrophysiological prop-
erties (76, 77). However, within large families of ion channels, there is
considerable overlap in biophysical properties and electrophysiological
function (78, 79), a feature known as degeneracy (80–82). The concept of
degeneracy is demonstrated by experimental (83–85) and computational

 studies (81, 84, 86), showing that multiple conductance distributions can
give rise to membrane properties that are biologically indistinguishable.
Because cytosine methylation seems to broadly regulate the expression
of genes encoding ion channels (Fig. 4), it is difficult to predict the pre-
cise transcriptional changes occurring in response to DNMTi or the
combinatorial influence on neuronal membrane properties.
Therefore, we examined how DNMTi affects single APs, which re-
present the functional output unit of the active neuronal membrane. By
measuring waveform characteristics of single APs, we sought to identify
potential families of voltage-gated or Ca2+-activated ion channels that
may drive DNMTi-enhanced IME. After 24-hour exposure of cultured
cortical neurons to RG108, we performed patch-clamp recordings of
pyramidal cells. RG108 did not affect passive membrane properties (Table
1). We then elicited single APs using a 30-ms-long suprathreshold cur-
rent injection from −60 mV (Fig. 5A), measured AP waveform character-
istics, and constructed phase plane plots of single APs by calculating
the first derivative of the change in membrane potential with respect to
time (that is, the rate of change in mV/ms) and plotting those values at
specific points in time against the membrane voltage (87). RG108 had

 or one-half width (Fig. 5B and Table 2), indicating that DNMTi did
not change the overall distribution or properties of the voltage-
dependent ion channel families that underlie these components of the
AP waveform. Additionally, in both the control and RG108-exposed
groups, we found correlations between the maximal rate of depo-
larization and the AP amplitude and the maximal rate of repolarization
and the AP one-half width, likely due to the similar contributions of
inward Na+ conductances activated during the AP rising phase and out-
ward K+ conductances activated during the AP repolarization phase
(Fig. 5C).
However, RG108 decreased the voltage threshold (measured as the
abrupt increase in dV/dt; Fig. 5, D and E, and Table 2), such that an AP
occurred at more negative potentials, indicating a change in the voltage-
dependent currents that underlie AP generation. RG108 also altered
specific components of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) potential that
follows the repolarization phase. RG108 did not affect the amplitude of
the fast AHP but decreased the amplitude of the medium AHP (mAHP)
without affecting the time-to-peak AHP amplitude (Fig. 5F and Table 2).
These results indicated that pharmacological DNMTi with RG108 induces
specific changes in the expression, properties, or distribution of the out-
ward K+ conductances that drive the AHP in cortical pyramidal neurons
(88–90). Together, our results suggested that DNMTi increases IME
through specific changes in the AP waveform, namely, the voltage thresh-
old and the mAHP
, indicating that the transcriptional changes induced by
the inhibition of DNA methylation have specific functional consequences
at the neuronal membrane.

 DNMT knockdown decreases the mAHP, decreases SK
channel mRNA, and increases IME
In postmitotic neurons, DNA methylation occurs predominantly
through the activity of DNMT1 and DNMT3A (16, 17). Because
RG108 is a nonselective inhibitor of DNMT activity (91), we used
an ASO-mediated knockdown approach to evaluate the contribution
of each methyltransferase on target gene expression and IME. We de-
signed ASOs to specifically reduce the abundance of DNMT1 and
DNMT3A (Fig. 6, A to C) (34). After a 6- to 7-day ASO treatment, we
recorded passive membrane properties (Table 1) and measured evoked
firing rates and single AP waveform characteristics (Table 3). DNMT3A
knockdown hyperpolarized the resting membrane potential, whereas
DNMT1 knockdown had no effect on resting membrane potential (Table
1). Moreover, knocking down neither DNMT1 nor DNMT3A affected
other passive properties (Table 1). However, reducing the abundance of
either DNMT1 or DNMT3A increased AP firing rates evoked by current
injection (Fig. 6, D and E), suggesting that the decreased abundance of
either methyltransferase alone is sufficient to increase IME. Last, indi-
vidual knockdown of DNMT1 or DNMT3A produced distinct effects on
AP waveform characteristics. In contrast to pharmacological DNMTi
(Fig. 5), a reduction in either methyltransferase did not affect the voltage
threshold (Table 3), suggesting that inhibition of both DNMT1 and
DNMT3A is necessary to change the abundance, properties, or dis-
tribution of the voltage-dependent channels that underlie AP generation.
Similar to pharmacological DNMTi, DNMT1 or DNMT3A knockdown
did not affect depolarization or repolarization rates, AP amplitude, or AP
one-half widths (Table 3). Last, knocking down only DNMT3A de-
creased the fast AHP (Table 3), whereas knocking down either DNMT1
or DNMT3A decreased the mAHP (Fig. 6, F and G, and Table 3).
The reduced mAHP observed after DNMT1 or DNMT3A knockdown
suggested that the decreased activity of these methyltransferases results in
decreased abundance of the outward K+ current–mediating ion channels
that are active during AP repolarization. In cortical pyramidal cells, the
activity of small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) channels partially
shapes the mAHP (92, 93). Notably, decreased SK channel abundance,
such as that resulting from behavioral experience or genetic or pharmaco-
logical manipulation, decreases the mAHP and increases IME (89, 94, 95).
We therefore examined the effect of DNMT1 or DNMT3A knockdown
on the mRNA abundance of the three subtypes of SK channels that are
present in the rat brain (96). Knocking down either DNMT1 or DNMT3A
decreased the abundance of all three SK channel mRNAs relative to that
in the neurons receiving the scrambled control ASO (Fig. 6H). These
results implied that DNA cytosine methylation directly or indirectly reg-
ulates the expression or transcript abundance of the entire family of genes
encoding SK channels, and effect that could contribute to a decreased
mAHP and increased IME resulting from reduced DNMT activity.
The SK channel–specific blocker apamin is ineffective
after DNMTi
If reduced SK channel abundance or activity underlies the increased
IME caused by the chronic inhibition of DNA cytosine methylation,
then subsequent pharmacological blockade of these channels should
not trigger any additional effect changes in AP firing rates and mAHP
amplitude above that already produced by DNMTi. Thus, we used apa-
min, a bee venom toxin that is a selective SK channel blocker (97), to
examine the contribution of SK channels to evoked AP firing rates and
mAHP amplitudes after DNMTi in cultured pyramidal neurons. Apa-
min, in the presence or absence of RG108, had no effect on the passive
properties of the neurons (Table 1). In control cells, apamin decreased
the mAHP amplitude of single APs (Fig. 7, A and B, and Table 4) and
increased the evoked AP firing rates compared to control cells recorded in
the absence of extracellular apamin (Fig. 7, C and D). In contrast, apamin
did not change the mAHP amplitudes of single APs or evoked firing rates
of neurons exposed to RG108 (Fig. 7, E to H, and Table 4). These results
indicated that reduced SK channel conductance underlies the observed
DNMTi-mediated reductions in mAHP amplitude and increased AP firing
rates. Collectively, our results suggested that the regulation of SK channel
transcript abundance by DNA cytosine methylation contributes to AP
waveform characteristics and IME of individual pyramidal neurons.
DISCUSSION
Dynamic epigenomic modulation regulates the coordinated gene ex-
pression profiles necessary for the formation and maintenance of
long-term memories resulting from behavioral training (6, 9). Although
the modulation of behavior by an experientially altered nuclear readout
is thought to be due to the induction of neuronal plasticity, the full spec-
trum of necessary cellular adaptations and their underlying mechanisms
are areas of intense investigation (1, 2, 4). Epigenetic modifications, such
as DNA cytosine methylation, regulate forms of synaptic plasticity that
involve local modifications in postsynaptic strength, including long-
term potentiation (18, 20, 30, 31, 98–100) and long-term depression
(20, 26), and forms of homeostatic plasticity, such as synaptic scaling,
that involve cell-wide modifications in postsynaptic strength (33, 34).
In addition to plasticity at the synapse, transcription-dependent
changes in the intrinsic excitability of the neuronal membrane contrib-
ute to the cellular adaptations underlying learning and memory (4, 56).
Although growing evidence implicates epigenetic mechanisms in intrinsic
plasticity (3), a mechanistic understanding of how DNA methylation
influences neuronal IME is lacking. This study established activity-
dependent DNA cytosine methylation as a critical regulator of neuronal
IME. Collectively, our results showed that epigenetic regulation by
DNA methylation affects transcript abundance of a family of K+ chan-
nels to ultimately shape the AP waveform and repetitive AP firing be-
havior of individual cortical pyramidal neurons.
Here, we observed that inhibition of DNMT activity by pharmaco-
logical antagonism or by ASO-mediated DNMT knockdown increased
neuronal IME, evidenced by an increased evoked AP frequency. Nota-
bly, DNMT1 or DNMT3A knockdown phenocopied the increased evoked
AP frequency observed after exposure to the pharmacological DNMTi
RG108 (Figs. 1, B and C, and 6, B and C). This effect contrasts our pre-
vious findings that both DNMT1 and DNMT3A knockdown was required

 to produce glutamatergic synaptic upscaling of equal magnitude to the up-
scaling produced by RG108 (34). Together, these studies highlight the im-
portant, and perhaps overlapping, roles of DNMT1 and DNMT3A in
regulating neuronal adaptations and also suggest that key distinctions
may exist in the induction of intrinsic plasticity and synaptic scaling by
dynamic DNA cytosine methylation. Future studies are needed to examine
whether DNMT1 and DNMT3A converge on the same genes that encode
individual or families of ion channels involved in neuronal excitability, yet
diverge on the genes encoding proteins involved in glutamatergic
signaling and AMPA receptor trafficking.

 In further support of our interpretation that distinct yet overlapping
mechanisms exist between intrinsic plasticity and synaptic scaling, we
showed here that increased IME caused by DNMT inhibition depended
on synaptic transmission through both AMPA and NMDA receptors
(Fig. 2), whereas previously we found that synaptic upscaling caused by
DNMT inhibition was not dependent on NMDA receptor signaling (34).
These observations are consistent with other studies showing that homeo-
static intrinsic plasticity relies on NMDA receptor signaling, whereas ho-
meostatic synaptic upscaling does not (54, 55, 101, 102). However, an
additional layer of complexity is that the molecular mechanisms that
regulate homeostatic synaptic downscaling are not inverse of those that
regulate homeostatic synaptic upscaling; in particular, downscaling de-
pends on NMDA receptor signaling (103). Thus, future investigations
are needed to examine the mechanisms of receptor signaling involved
in the regulation of IME and cell-wide synaptic scaling by DNA cyto-
sine methylation.
Our experiments implicated transcriptional repression or mRNA de-
stabilization of SK channels (Fig. 6F) and subsequent reduction in the
mAHP amplitude (Figs. 5 to 7) as a probable mechanism underlying the
DNMTi-mediated enhancement of IME. Our post hoc analysis of previ-
ously published results (33) also revealed a TET3 knockdown–mediated
alteration in SK channel transcripts (Fig. 4B), a finding that further rein-
forces a link between DNA cytosine methylation and the expression of
genes encoding SK channels. However, our studies do not exclude the
possibility that the activity or abundance of additional families of voltage-
or ligand-activated ion channels, or a combination thereof, may be altered
by DNMTi. For example, we interpret our finding that DNMTi hyperpo-
larized the resting membrane potential and decreased the AP threshold as
indicative of demethylation-associated secondary transcriptional changes
resulting in altered activity or abundance of other ion channel families,
such as inwardly rectifying K+ channels (104) and voltage-gated Na+
channels (105). This interpretation is supported by the widespread altera-
tions in ion channel transcripts revealed by our post hoc analyses of neu-
rons in which TET3 was knocked down, which also identified alterations
in transcripts for inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Fig. 4B) and voltage-
gated Na+ channels (Fig. 4C). Additionally, homeostatic intrinsic plasticity
caused by prolonged exposure to TTX is associated with decreased ex-
pression of genes encoding voltage-gated K+ channels, Ca2+-activated
K+ channels, and tandem-pore K+ channels (55). Collectively, these ob-
servations suggest that dynamic alterations in DNA cytosine methyla-
tion broadly affect the expression of genes encoding ion channels.
Nevertheless, our electrophysiological recordings indicated a high
level of functional degeneracy at the neuronal membrane, because
much of the passive and active membrane properties remained un-
affected by DNMTi. Presumably, a portion of the underlying transcrip-
tional changes could be subtractive or antagonistic in nature, resulting
in limited functional consequence on AP waveform and repetitive
firing behavior. Future studies will be necessary to identify the precise
transcriptome-wide changes in the expression of ion channel–encoding
genes mediated by reduced DNMT activity and to illuminate the physio-
logical consequences produced by discrete and combinatorial patterns of
altered channel expression.
Furthermore, although our studies indicated a link between DNA cy-
tosine methylation, the expression of SK channel–encoding genes, and SK
channel activity, we do not exclude the possibility that DNMTi may affect
the expression or activity of SK channel modifiers involved in fine-tuning
the Ca2+ sensitivity and gating of these channels (106–108). Another pos-
sibility is that DNMTi affects SK channel activity through alterations in
the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in the accumulation
of intracellular Ca2+ by entry through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels or by
release from intracellular Ca2+ stores (89, 94, 95). In our post hoc analyses
of TET3 knockdown neurons, we found alterations in transcripts for var-
ious voltage- and ligand-gated Ca2+ channels (Fig. 4D), suggesting that
the expression of these genes falls within the transcription-regulating
potential of DNA cytosine methylation. However, future studies will be
needed to directly examine the role of cytosine methylation in the tran-
scriptional regulation of genes that encode proteins involved in the mod-
ulation of SK channel activity.
We believe that the discovery that DNMT inhibition can increase
neuronal IME has three important implications related to neuroepige-
netic research. First, from a pathoetiological perspective, our findings
suggest new mechanistic hypotheses for neuropsychiatric disorders as-
sociated with alterations in intrinsic plasticity. Disorders characterized
by alterations in IME might have underlying dysregulation in the ex-
pression of ion channel–encoding genes driven by altered cytosine
methylation. This is certainly possible for epilepsy (109) and neuro-
pathic pain (110) but may extend to other disorders, such as anxiety
(111), depression (112), Alzheimer’s disease (113), and drug addiction
(114). Second, interventions or manipulations that rely on broad-
spectrum or even isoform-specific modulation of DNMT function will
affect neuronal excitability. For example, if alterations in intrinsic ex-
citability are critical to the pathogenesis of a specific disorder, then a
genome-wide epigenetic therapeutic approach would be a possible av-
enue for therapeutics. If not, approaches that use zinc finger nucleases
(ZFNs), transcriptional activator–like effectors (TALEs), or the
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/
Cas9 system (91, 115) to target DNA methylation enzymes to specific
genomic sequences would be preferred to limit unintentional con-
sequences on intrinsic excitability.
Finally, an expanded repertoire of neuronal adaptations regulated by
DNA cytosine methylation requires a renewed examination of previous
studies in which DNMTi impaired memory formation (18, 19, 22, 69, 116)
and maintenance (21). At the time, these findings were attributed to
DNMTi-mediated dysregulation of the necessary gene expression pro-
files required for synaptic plasticity. Although this effect is likely con-
tributory, DNMTi might also produce memory deficits by disrupting
the regulation of other neuronal adaptations, such as homeostatic syn-
aptic scaling and intrinsic plasticity. Normally, synaptic strength and
IME are carefully tuned, such that neurons within memory circuits act
as “high-pass” saliency filters, selectively responding with APs to robust
and behaviorally relevant synaptic activity, thus generating an appropriate
behavior response through targeted local synaptic plasticity. In contrast,
under a highly excitable and upscaled neuronal state, any and all synaptic
inputs, including nonsalient and behaviorally irrelevant ones, could poten-
tially activate memory circuits, resulting in saturated and nonselective syn-
aptic plasticity and degraded memory fidelity. Simply put, such an
interpretation suggests that DNMTi-mediated IME and glutamatergic
upscaling decrease information storage capacity by decreasing a given
neuron’s overall signal-to-noise ratio of synaptic activity to AP gener-
ation in response to learning-related stimuli (114). Undoubtedly, future
investigation will be required to explore these topics among others to
obtain a comprehensive understanding of the role of DNA methylation
in neuronal information storage.

 24°C with poly-L-lysine (50 mg/ml) (Sigma-Aldrich) and rinsed three
times with diH2O. For electrophysiological experiments, poly-L-lysine
was added to nitric acid–treated glass coverslips (Menzel-Gläser). Em-
bryonic day 18 cortical tissues were dissected in Hanks’ balanced salt
solution (Thermo Scientific), digested in papain (Worthington), and dis-
sociated with fire-polished glass pipettes in Neurobasal medium (Thermo
Scientific) supplemented with L-glutamine and B-27 (Thermo Scientific).
Dissociated cells were filtered with a 70-mm cell strainer and centrifuged.
Cells were resuspended in the supplemented Neurobasal medium at a con-
centration of 250,000/ml and plated. Cells were grown in a humidified
CO2 (5%) incubator at 37°C. One-half of the medium was changed at
2 days in vitro (DIV) and every 4 DIV thereafter. Patch-clamp recordings
were made after 24-hour drug treatments or 6 to 7 days after a single ASO
dose. RNA was collected at 21 DIV after a 6- to 7-day ASO treatment.
Cultured neurons were treated for 24 hours with pharmacological agents
at the following concentrations: 0.1% DMSO (control), 100 mM RG108
(Calbiochem), 1 mM TTX, 10 mM NBQX, 50 mM APV
, and 1.25 mM
actinomycin D (Sigma-Aldrich).
ASO design and neuronal treatment
The design, preparation, and use of Dnmt1-, Dnmt3a-, and Tet1-targeting
ASOs were conducted as previously described (34). ASOs were 20-mers
constructed on a phosphorothioate-modified backbone, containing a cen-
tral region of 10 2′-deoxynucleotides flanked 5′ and 3′ by 5 2′-O-methyl
(OMe)–modified nucleotide “wings” (“5-10-5 2′-OMe gapmers”). ASO
sequences were as follows: scrambled control, 5′-mA-mC-mU-mC-mG-

ogies) to 150 mM, and the stock was added to the culture medium to a
final concentration of 1.5 mM.
Whole-cell recordings
Because the density of voltage-dependent currents increases with post-
natal age, plateauing about 3 to 5 weeks in neocortical pyramidal cells
(117), cultured cortical cells were allowed to grow for 20 to 21 DIV
. After
drug or ASO treatment, whole-cell patch-clamp recordings were made
from visually identified pyramidal neurons using a Zeiss Axiovert 25
inverted microscope. The extracellular solution contained the following:
120 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 15 mM Hepes, 20 mM glucose, 2 mM CaCl2,
and 1 mM MgCl2 (pH 7.3). Patch pipettes had resistances of 3 to 5 megohms
when filled with the recording solution containing 125 mM K-gluconate,
10 mM KCl, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM creatine phosphate, 2 mM Mg–
adenosine triphosphate, 0.2 mM Na–guanosine triphosphate, and 0.5 mM
EGTA (pH 7.3). All recordings were performed at room temperature (21°
to 23°C) in the presence of 20 mM 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione
and 50 mM APV to block fast excitatory transmission and 20 mM bicu-
culline to block fast inhibitory transmission. Bath application of 100 nM
apamin (Abcam) was used to block SK channels. Recorded signals were
amplified with an Axopatch 200B amplifier (Molecular Devices), filtered
at 2 kHz, and digitized at 10 kHz with Digidata 1200 Series (Molecular
Devices). Data were compiled and analyzed using Clampfit (Molecular
Devices), Microsoft Excel, and Prism (GraphPad Software Inc.). Interspike
intervals were measured using Mini Analysis (Synaptosoft) software.
In all experiments, tip potentials were zeroed before membrane-pipette
seals were formed. Capacitance and series resistance were determined
in voltage-clamp mode upon entering the whole-cell configuration and
estimated using a voltage step of −10 mV from a holding potential of
−70 mV
. Series resistances ranged between 12 and 30 megohms and
did not differ among any of the groups. Current-clamp recordings were
obtained from cells with stable resting membrane potentials more neg-
ative or equal to −50 mV
. All recorded potentials were corrected for a
−15-mV liquid junction potential. Cell input resistance was determined
by injecting a small (20 pA) hyperpolarizing current pulse (500 ms)
and calculated by dividing the steady-state voltage response by the cur-
rent pulse amplitude. The membrane time constant was measured by
fitting the membrane potential trajectory during a small hyperpolariz-
ing current injection with a single exponential equation. To evaluate
active IME, we somatically injected a series of 500-ms depolarizing
current pulses (10-pA steps, 10 to 100 pA) to evoke trains of APs. Be-
cause of potential differences in resting membrane potential among
treatment groups, all APs were evoked from an adjusted membrane
potential of −60 mV
. AP frequency was determined by averaging the
reciprocal of each interspike interval at a given current pulse for each cell.
Single APs were elicited by a 30-ms suprathreshold step from −60 mV
,
and waveform characteristics were determined by differentiating the spike
voltage with respect to time (dV/dt). Plane phase plots were constructed by
plotting the first derivative in mV/ms against the membrane voltage (87).
Threshold was defined as the membrane voltage corresponding to the
abrupt increase in dV/dt. Maximum depolarization and repolarization rates
corresponded to the maximum rate of change during the AP upstroke and
downstroke, respectively. AP amplitude was measured from the voltage
threshold to the peak positive deflection, and one-half width was measured
as the duration at the halfway point between the threshold and peak am-
plitude. The amplitudes of the fast and medium AHPs of single APs were
determined, respectively, by measuring the maximal negative deflections
in potential 3.5 to 5 ms and 10 to 50 ms after the membrane potential
reached the equipotential point of the AP threshold during repolarization.

 RNA using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (Bio-Rad). Quantitative reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT
-PCR) was carried out using a
CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with either
SSO Advanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 500 nM
of intron-spanning primers (Table 5) or TaqMan Universal Master Mix II,
no UNG, and TaqMan gene expression assays (Thermo Scientific) with hy-
drolysis probes for Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
(catalog no. Rn01775763_g1) and Kcnn2 (catalog no. Rn00570910_m1).
PCR amplifications were performed in triplicate under the following
cycling conditions: 95°C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 s
and 60°C (or 58°C) for 30 s, followed by real-time melt analysis to verify
product specificity (SYBR), or 95°C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles
of 95°C for 15 s and 60°C for 60 s (TaqMan). Differential gene expres-
sion between samples was determined by the comparative Ct (DDCt)
method using Gapdh as an internal control.
Immunoblots
Cortical neuron cultures were directly homogenized in 2× Laemmli
buffer. Protein samples were prepared with 2-mercaptoethanol, heated for
10 min at 95°C, then separated on 7.5% Mini-Protean TGX Gels (Bio-
Rad), and transferred to Immobilon-FL PVDF membranes (Millipore)
using the Trans-Blot Turbo semidry transfer system (Bio-Rad). The mem-
brane was blocked in LI-COR Odyssey blocking buffer for 1 hour at room
temperature and incubated with the appropriate primary antibody. The
specific primary antibody treatment parameters were as follows: DNMT1
(Abcam, ab87656; 1:1000, overnight at 4°C), DNMT3A (Abcam,
ab2850; 1:200, overnight at 4°C), and actin (Abcam, ab3280; 1:1000,
1 hour at room temperature). After primary antibody treatment, mem-
branes were washed three times in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween
(TBS-T), followed by incubation for 1 hour with Alexa Fluor 800–
conjugated goat antibodies specific for mouse immunoglobulin G
(1:20,000; LI-COR). Membranes were then washed three times in TBS-
T, followed by a single wash in TBS, imaged on the LI-COR Odyssey
fluorescence imaging system, and quantified using LI-COR Image Studio.
RNA-seq data analysis
To identify voltage- and calcium-gated ion channels homeostatically
regulated in response to alterations in DNA methylation, we used pub-
licly available RNA-seq data sets from embryonic hippocampal neu-
rons treated with either control- or Tet3-targeting shRNAs [see (33);
GSE67245]. Raw paired-end sequenced reads were downloaded, quality-
controlled (FASTQC v0.63, Galaxy), filtered for read quality (FASTX
toolkit, Galaxy), and aligned to the mouse genome (mm10 assembly)
in Galaxy (118) using TopHat v2.0.14 (with custom settings –read-realign-
edit-dist 0 –r 131 –mate-std-dev 64 –no-coverage-search –microexon-search
–no-novel-juncs –G iGenomesmm10UCSCRefSeq.GTF –b2-very-sensitive)
(119). Gene expression differences between groups were calculated in
Galaxy using Cuffdiff v2.2.1 (with custom settings –library-norm-method
quartile –dispersion-method per-condition –u –b –c 10 –FDR 0.05) (120).
Gene ontology overrepresentation of significantly altered genes was con-
ducted with PANTHER (v10.0) (72, 73), using the Gene Ontology
database (06 August 2015 release) (74, 75) and a Bonferroni multiple test-
ing correction.
Statistics
Results are means ± SEM. An unpaired Student’
s t or Mann-Whitney test
was used when comparing two groups. A one-way ANOVA was used
when comparing more than two groups. Differences in AP frequency ver-
sus current injection were assessed with two-way RM-ANOVAs. The
threshold for significance was P < 0.05 for all analyses.
