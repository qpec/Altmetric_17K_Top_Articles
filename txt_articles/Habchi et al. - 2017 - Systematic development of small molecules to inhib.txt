The aggregation of the 42-residue form of the amyloid-β peptide
(Aβ42) is a pivotal event in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The use of
chemical kinetics has recently enabled highly accurate quantifications
of the effects of small molecules on specific microscopic steps in Aβ42
aggregation. Here, we exploit this approach to develop a rational
drug discovery strategy against Aβ42 aggregation that uses as a read-
out the changes in the nucleation and elongation rate constants
caused by candidate small molecules. We thus identify a pool of
compounds that target specific microscopic steps in Aβ42 aggrega-
tion. We then test further these small molecules in human cerebro-
spinal fluid and in a Caenorhabditis elegans model of AD. Our results
show that this strategy represents a powerful approach to identify
systematically small molecule lead compounds, thus offering an ap-
pealing opportunity to reduce the attrition problem in drug discovery.
Alzheimer’s disease | amyloid-β peptide | protein misfolding | drug
discovery | protein aggregation
A
lzheimer’s disease (AD) is, to date, an incurable neurode-
generative disorder that imposes substantial social and eco-
nomic costs worldwide (1). According to the amyloid hypothesis,
the aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) initiates a cascade of
molecular events leading eventually to neuronal death (2–11). Be-
cause the presence of abnormal Aβ metabolism can be detected 10–
20 years before the onset of AD (12, 13), early interventions may be
possible before widespread and irreversible neurodegeneration has
occurred. Although targeting Aβ accumulation has been pursued as
a major potential therapeutic strategy against AD (14–17), no com-
pound selected for this purpose has yet entered clinical use (18, 19).
Although these failures have raised doubts about the amyloid hy-
pothesis (20), they can also be attributed to an incomplete knowledge
of the molecular mechanisms by which the compounds tested so far
affect the nucleation and growth of Aβ aggregates. Indeed, it has been
shown that inhibiting Aβ aggregation without a detailed understanding
of the underlying microscopic processes could affect the toxicity in
unexpected ways (21, 22). For example, the inhibition of nucleation
events may delay or decrease toxicity, whereas the inhibition of elon-
gation may lead to an overall increase in toxicity (21, 22). Therefore,
effective therapeutic strategies must be aimed at targeting precise
microscopic steps during the Aβ aggregation process (21, 23–25).
We describe here the development of a systematic pipeline
based on chemical kinetics to identify a pool of candidate mol-
ecules directed against the aggregation of the 42-residue form
of Aβ (Aβ42), and to understand the key chemical features re-
sponsible for their inhibitory activity.
Results and Discussion
A Quasi-Structure–Based Drug Discovery Strategy. We introduce first a
quasi-structure–based drug discovery (QSBDD) strategy, which
builds on the recent finding that the small molecule bexarotene
delays primary nucleation in Aβ42 aggregation (22) (Fig. 1A).
Because primary nuclei form only transiently during the aggrega-
tion process (21, 23, 24), it is extremely challenging to characterize
their structures experimentally, making it difficult to apply to them
structure-based drug discovery strategies. The structural features of
these transient nuclei, however, may be shared with other biolog-
ical targets of bexarotene, which was initially identified as a retinoid
X receptor (RXR) agonist and approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma
(26). Ligands that bind RXRs and their partners, the retinoid A
receptors (RARs), modulate the communication of these recep-
tors with their intracellular environments (27, 28). The mecha-
nisms of binding of the ligands to the RAR and RXR ligand-
binding domains (LBDs) are well understood and are exploited for
pharmaceutical purposes (27, 29). We took advantage of the data
available on the atomic structures of the LBDs and the chemical
properties of the known agonists and antagonists of RARs and
Significance
The absence of fully reproducible protein aggregation assays
has contributed to the systematic failures in clinical trials for
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) of compounds targeting the aggre-
gation process of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). To address this
problem, we report the identification of a library of com-
pounds against Aβ aggregation using a drug discovery strategy
based on highly quantitative aggregation rate measurements.
We then demonstrate, both in Caenorhabditis elegans and
human cerebrospinal fluid, that this approach can systemati-
cally provide a rich variety of related small molecules to take
forward into a drug discovery process. We therefore report an
approach that should substantially help overcome the very high
level of attrition associated with drug discovery programs for AD.

 RXRs, and applied QSBDD by presuming that, like bexarotene,
other RXR and RAR ligands may inhibit the aggregation of Aβ42.
We thus collected a group of 12 small molecules (Fig. 1B), in-
cluding five RAR agonists (tamibarotene, BMS753, adapalene,
CD1530, TTNPB, and Ch55), four RAR antagonists (BMS195614,
LE135, MM11253, and BMS493), two RXR agonists (bexarotene
and SR11237), and one RXR antagonist (UVI3003). We tested
these compounds in a thioflavin-T (ThT)-based chemical kinetics
assay and compared their effects on the different microscopic steps
in the Aβ42 aggregation reaction (Fig. 1C).
RAR and RXR Ligands Inhibit Aβ42 Aggregation to Different Extents.
We monitored Aβ42 fibril formation in vitro for 2 μM Aβ42 in
the absence and presence of these small molecules. For Aβ42
alone the half-time of aggregation was about 2 h under the buffer
conditions used. For each compound except BMS753, we ob-
served substantial delays in Aβ42 aggregation when the com-
pounds were included at a concentration of 6 μM [3 molar
equivalents (M eq)] (Fig. 2A). In most cases, the delays were
greater than those assessed for bexarotene, and five of the 12
molecules (MM11253, BMS493, adapalene, CD1530, and LE135)
inhibited the aggregation of Aβ42 completely over 10 h of ob-
servation (Fig. 2A). These five compounds were very effective in
delaying the aggregation of Aβ42 even at substoichiometric ratios
(0.5 M eq; Fig. 2B). To investigate these effects further and to
exclude possible interferences of the compounds with ThT binding
to Aβ42 fibrils and the fluorescence measurements, we probed the
quantities of Aβ42 fibrils at 12 time points during the aggregation
reaction in the absence and presence of the small molecules using
a dot-blot assay with an Aβ42 fibril-specific antibody (OC; see
Methods) (Fig. 2 C and D and Fig. S1). The delay induced by the
small molecules in the dot-blot assay was found to be identical
within experimental error to the delay observed in the ThT-
based assay.
We subsequently classified these molecules according to their
efficacy in inhibiting Aβ42 aggregation. The intensities of the dot
blots (Fig. 2 C and D) were quantified and normalized against
the intensity of Aβ42 alone. The values at two early time points
were plotted against the half-times derived from the ThT-based
kinetics (Fig. 2 E and F), resulting in a linear correlation,
showing the high degree of consistency between the two assays.
This analysis allowed the classification of the RAR and RXR
ligands in two sets according to the extent of the delay induced
in Aβ42 aggregation (Fig. 2 E and F). Set A consists of seven
molecules showing an effect at 3 M eq similar to or greater than
the effect of bexarotene (Fig. 2E, light green), and set B consists
of five molecules that completely inhibited Aβ42 aggregation for
at least 10 h at 3 M eq. We then analyzed the effects of these
molecules at substoichiometric concentrations by both assays
(Fig. 2F, light orange). UVI3003 was identified as the most ef-
fective molecule within set A, delaying by more than fourfold the
aggregation reaction, whereas MM11253 and adapalene were
found to be the most effective molecules within set B, because
the aggregation of 2 μM Aβ42 was delayed by at least threefold
at a concentration half of the concentration of Aβ42. Further-
more, RAR and RXR ligands inhibited Aβ42 reaction in a
concentration-dependent manner, with set B molecules showing
efficacy at concentration ratios as low as 0.2 (Fig. S2). The only
molecule that did not show any effect on Aβ42 aggregation was
BMS753, even when present at 5 M eq (Fig. S3).
RAR and RXR Ligands Inhibit Primary and Secondary Pathways. We
next carried out a quantitative analysis of the effects of the
molecules by matching the experimental aggregation profiles to
kinetic curves obtained by using the rate laws derived from a
master equation that relates the time evolution of fibril forma-
tion to the rate constants of the different microscopic events (21,
24, 25). In this approach, the aggregation profiles in the presence
of an inhibitor are described by introducing into the rate laws
suitable perturbations to each of the microscopic rate constants
evaluated in the absence of the inhibitor. The modifications of
the rate constants required to describe the aggregation profiles
in the presence of different concentrations of inhibitor are then
indicative of the specific process affected by the presence of the
compound (21).
At low concentrations of small molecules, the data are ex-
tremely well described when the primary pathways [as expressed
by the product of the of primary nucleation and rate of elonga-
tion (knk+)] are specifically decreased at less than a 3 M eq of set
A and less than 0.5–1 M eq of set B molecules, where k+ is the
rate constant of fibril elongation and kn is the rate constant for
primary nucleation (Fig. 3 A–C and F–H and Figs. S4 and S5). By
contrast, at higher concentrations of small molecules, the data
are consistent with a decrease in the rate constants of both pri-
mary (knk+) and secondary (k2k+) pathways, where k2 is the rate
constant of surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation. All kinetic
curves were then compared with simulations where both primary
and secondary pathways were decreased concomitantly, and the
rates of both pathways were plotted against the concentration of
small molecules (Fig. 2 A–J and Figs. S4 and S5). This analysis
revealed that set A and set B molecules can affect both nucleation
pathways in Aβ42 aggregation (Fig. 2 A–J and Figs. S4 and S5).
To quantify the effects of the small molecules on Aβ42 ag-
gregation further, we examined the increase in ThT fluorescence
at the end of the reaction, finding similar values in all cases (Figs.
S4H and S5F). These results suggest that a similar fibril mass
concentration is formed irrespective of whether or not the small
molecules are present, in agreement with the dot-blot assays. In
addition, the effect of the small molecules on the aggregation
kinetics of Aβ42 was found to be mainly determined by the molar
ratio of the small molecules with respect to Aβ42 rather than by
its total absolute concentration (Fig. S6 A–C), thus implying that
our experiments are conducted above the Kd for the relevant
interactions. Based on these results, given that the concentration
of Aβ42 is much lower in vivo than that used here in vitro, we
would expect that much lower concentrations of the compounds
could be required to affect the rate constants of Aβ42 aggrega-
tion to the same extent, although the molar ratio might need to
be increased in the concentration range below the value of Kd.
Furthermore, to rule out any possible interference of the small
molecules on the aggregation pathway of Aβ42, such as a stabi-
lization of nonfibrillar aggregates, we used transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) to image the Aβ42 species formed at the end
of the aggregation reactions in the absence and presence of
two representative molecules from sets A and B, namely,
BMS195614 and LE135 (Fig. S6 E and F). In agreement with our
previous atomic force microscopy findings on the effect of bex-
arotene on the aggregation kinetics of Aβ42 (22), the TEM im-
ages showed that similar Aβ42 fibrillar species are formed at the
end of the aggregation reactions.
RAR and RXR Ligands Inhibit Secondary Pathways to Different Extents.
To explore further the effects of the molecules on distinct steps of
the secondary pathways further (i.e., on the surface-catalyzed
secondary nucleation and elongation steps), we carried out an
additional series of kinetic measurements in the presence of the
different compounds and various concentrations of preformed
fibril seeds. For about 10% of preformed fibrils, the primary and
secondary nucleation steps are bypassed and the formation of
mature fibrils is greatly accelerated by elongation reactions pro-
moted by the fibril seeds (Fig. S7). Under these conditions, set A
molecules did not affect the aggregation kinetics of 2 μM Aβ42
even at a concentration of 5 M eq relative to the peptide (Fig. 4A),
whereas the corresponding aggregation process under unseeded
conditions was slowed by at least a factor of 3 (Fig. 2A), strongly
indicating that the set A compounds have no effect on elongation.

Schematic illustration of the drug discovery strategy targeting Aβ42 aggregation described in this work. The strategy consists of two main steps: (i) a QSBDD step
and (ii) a kinetics-based drug discovery (KBDD) step. QSBDD consists of identifying potential molecules against Aβ42 aggregation based on the structure of a receptor
(here, RXR) of a small molecule (here, bexarotene) shown preferentially to inhibit a microscopic step in Aβ42 aggregation (here, primary nucleation). The rationale
behind this strategy is that the instability and transient nature of Aβ42 oligomers make their characterization and, subsequently, the structure-based drug development
very challenging. In this study, we considered known agonists and antagonists of RXR based on the possibility that structural similarities could exist between the binding
pockets of RXR and Aβ42 oligomers. The strategy was extended to include agonists and antagonists of RAR, given the high structural similarities with RXR. In total,
13 molecules were tested, including bexarotene. (A) This panel is adapted from a study by Habchi et al. (22) and shows the kinetics of 5 μM Aβ42 aggregation (black) in
the presence of increasing concentrations of bexarotene (i.e., 1–5 M eq). The structure [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID code 1XDK] of the RAR receptor (blue) is shown as a
dimer with the RXR receptor (orange). The RXR subunit is superimposed onto the subunit of RXR with bexarotene in the binding pocket (green; PDB ID code 4K6I). An
enlarged image of the binding pocket is also shown. (B) Structures of all the molecules tested in this study. (C) The KBDD step assesses the effect of a small molecule at
the microscopic level. (C) A given molecule can bind monomers, primary oligomers, secondary oligomers, fibrils, or a combination of species, and accordingly affects
different microscopic steps that can be characterized quantitatively by global fitting of the aggregation kinetics. The solid lines correspond to the aggregation kinetics of
Aβ42 in the absence of an inhibitor. The dotted lines correspond to the kinetics of Aβ42 in the presence of inhibitors that affect a single microscopic step.

RAR and RXR ligands affect Aβ42 aggregation to different extents. (A) Kinetic profiles of the aggregation of a 2 μM solution of Aβ42 in the absence and presence of
3 M eq of RAR and RXR ligands, shown in different colors. Note that Aβ42 did not aggregate within 10 h in the presence of five of the 13 molecules, seen as flat lines. (B)
Kinetic profiles of 2 μM Aβ42 aggregation in the absence and presence of substoichoimetric ratios of the five molecules that are shown as flat lines in A. (C and D)
Comparative time course of the formation of 2 μM Aβ42 fibrils in the absence and presence of 3 M eq of the small molecules using a dot-blot assay. Aβ42 in (D, Top) did not
aggregate in the presence of 3 M eq of adapalene, MM11253, BMS493, CD1530, and LE135; therefore, the aggregation kinetics of 2 μM Aβ42 were repeated in the presence
of substoichiometric quantities of the same molecules (0.5 M eq) (D, Bottom). The plots show, as histograms, the half-times of the aggregation reactions of Aβ42 from A and
B and, as open circles, the correlation between the normalized dot-blot intensities with respect to the correlation in the presence of 1% DMSO at 1.6 h and 2 h (E) and 1.5 h
and 2.5 h (F) of the aggregation reactions from C and D. The molecules were separated into two sets according to their potency, which was evaluated based on the extent

Characterization of the effects of set A and set B molecules on Aβ42 aggregation using quantitative chemical kinetics. (A–C) Kinetic profiles of the
aggregation of 2 μM Aβ42 in the absence and presence of either 1% DMSO (black) or 0.2 (red), 0.5 (cyan), 1 (blue), 2 (yellow), 3 (green), or 5 (magenta) M eq of
UVI3003, a representative molecule of set A. The solid lines show predictions for the resulting reaction profiles when primary pathways (A, knk+), secondary
pathways (B, k2k+), or both pathways (C) are inhibited by UVI3003. The abbreviation kn is the rate of primary nucleation, k+ is the rate of elongation, and k2 is the
rate of secondary nucleation. Only predictions when both pathways are inhibited fit the experimental data well. The dependence of the apparent reaction rate
constants (kapp) of primary pathways (D, knk+), and secondary pathways (E, k2k+), as derived from Fig. S4, is shown with increasing concentrations of small-
molecule inhibitors. In each case, k represents either knk+ (primary pathways) or k2k+ (secondary pathways). (F–H) Kinetic profiles of the aggregation of a 2 μM
Aβ42 solution in the absence and presence of either 1% DMSO (black) or 0.2 (red), 0.5 (cyan), 1 (blue), or 2 (yellow) M eq of CD1530, a representative molecule of
set B. The solid lines show predictions for the resulting reaction profiles when primary pathways (F, knk+), secondary pathways (G, k2k+), or both pathways (H) are
inhibited by CD1530. Only predictions when both pathways are inhibited fit the experimental data well. Dependences of the apparent reaction rate constants of
primary pathways (I, knk+) and secondary pathways (J, k2k+), as derived from Fig. S5, is shown with increasing concentrations of small-molecule inhibitors.

 This interpretation was confirmed quantitatively by deriving the
growth rate constants from the kinetic curves in the absence and
presence of each of the set A molecules (Fig. 4B). The molecules in
set B decreased the growth rate constants by about 25% at a
concentration fivefold greater than the peptide (Fig. 4 C and D),
thus explaining the increased delay in Aβ42 aggregation in the
presence of set B molecules with respect to Aβ42 aggregation in
set A molecules. Additionally, at substoichiometric concentrations
(e.g., a concentration ratio of 0.5 compared with the peptide), no
effects were observed with any of the set B molecules on the
elongation of Aβ42 fibrils, thus indicating that the inhibition of the
elongation step requires higher concentrations of small molecules
than the nucleation steps (Fig. 4 E and F).
To obtain a more complete comparative assessment on the
effects of set A and set B molecules on the secondary pathways
of Aβ42 aggregation, we measured the aggregation kinetics of a
2 μM Aβ42 sample in the presence of 1%, 2%, and 5% of fibril
seeds (Figs. S7 and S8). Simulations based on the experimental
kinetic curves show that primary nucleation is completely
bypassed when even the smallest ratios (1%) of preformed seeds
are introduced in the solution. By contrast, surface-catalyzed
secondary nucleation and elongation contribute in different ways
to the overall kinetics, with the contribution of elongation be-
coming more significant with increasing seed concentrations
(Fig. S7). Hence, following the aggregation kinetics of Aβ42
using different seed concentrations allows decoupling of the
secondary pathways into the surface-catalyzed secondary nucle-
ation and elongation steps. Such decoupling is crucial to char-
acterize the effects of the small molecules on the individual
microscopic steps; these effects might not otherwise be detected
directly from the aggregation kinetics in the absence of preformed
seeds (23, 25). Data at 1% and 5% of seeds showed a concen-
tration-dependent inhibition of secondary pathways (i.e., a re-
duction of k2k+) of Aβ42 aggregation in the presence of both sets
A and B of compounds (Fig. 4 G and H and Figs. S8 and S9). In
the case of set A molecules, the decrease at 0.5 and 5 M eq could
be attributed solely to a decrease in the rate constant of the
surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation (i.e., k2) because no ef-
fect could be observed on the elongation of the fibrils (i.e., k+) at
molar equivalents as high as 5 (Fig. 4 A and B). The rate con-
stants could be derived quantitatively from the kinetic curves and
were found to be decreased by about 50% and 75% in the
presence of 0.5 and 5 M eq of set A molecules, respectively.
Although the elongation of fibrils is essentially unaffected by
the set A molecules, these compounds have large effects on the
nucleation steps in Aβ42 aggregation. The effects on secondary
nucleation were very pronounced in the presence of low concen-
trations of the molecules, further supporting the key role of this
process in promoting the catalytic cycle in Aβ42 aggregation (24).
By contrast, for set B molecules, the effects on the secondary nu-
cleation rate constant could be quantified only under the conditions
where elongation was not affected (i.e., in the presence of 0.5 M eq
of the small molecules). Set B molecules were found to be signifi-
cantly more effective in inhibiting secondary nucleation in Aβ42
aggregation than set A molecules, with the decrease being as high as

Characterization of the effects of set A and set B molecules on the secondary pathways of Aβ42 aggregation. (A) Kinetic aggregation profiles of a
2 μM Aβ42 solution in the presence of 10% of preformed seeds in the absence (gray) or presence of 5 M eq of bexarotene (blue), TTNPB (cyan), and UVI3003
(orchid). Under these conditions, elongation of the fibrils is the dominant mechanism. (B) Normalized growth rate constants derived from the fitted curves in
A in the presence of 10% of preformed seed fibrils; these results show that set A molecules do not detectably affect the elongation rates of Aβ42 aggregation.
(C) Kinetic profiles of the aggregation of a 2 μM Aβ42 solution in the presence of 10% of preformed seeds in the absence (gray) or presence of 5 M eq of
MM11253 (green), adapalene (blue), and BMS493 (moss green); under these conditions, elongation of the fibrils is the dominant mechanism. (D) Normalized
growth rate constants derived from the fitted curves in C in the presence of 10% of preformed seed fibrils; these results show that set B molecules affect the
elongation rates of Aβ42 aggregation at 5 M eq. (E) Kinetic profiles of the aggregation of a 2 μM Aβ42 solution in the presence of 10% of preformed seeds in
the absence (gray) or presence of 0.5 M eq of MM11253 (green), adapalene (blue), and BMS493 (moss green); under these conditions, elongation of the fibrils
is the dominant mechanism. (F) Normalized growth rate constants derived from the fitted curves in E in the presence of 10% of preformed seed fibrils; these
results show that set B molecules at 0.5 M eq do not affect the elongation rates of Aβ42 aggregation. Effect of 0.5 and 5 M eq of set A (G; bexarotene, TTNPB,
and UVI3003) and set B (H; MM11253, adapalene, and BMS493) on the rates of the surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation (k2). The rate constants were
obtained from the aggregation kinetics of a 2 μM Aβ42 solution in the presence of 1%, 2%, and 5% of preformed seeds (Figs. S8 and S9), where primary
nucleation is negligible and surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation contributes ∼35%, 60%, and 80%, respectively, of the total quantity of fibrils formed,
according to the simulations shown in Fig. S7. The quantitative parameters were obtained from the fitted curves in Figs. S7 and S8. The observed effects could only
be due to decreasing the rate constants of surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation because elongation is not affected by the compounds under these conditions.

 75% at 0.5 M eq, thus further confirming the higher potency of set
B molecules with respect to the potency of set A molecules.
Characteristic Chemical Features of Small Molecules Are Required to
Inhibit Specific Microscopic Steps in Aβ42 Aggregation. The obser-
vation that set A and set B molecules affect different microscopic
steps in the aggregation of Aβ42 could result from the interac-
tions of the small molecules with different Aβ42 species formed
along the aggregation pathway (Fig. 5A), because inhibiting both
primary and secondary nucleation could result from binding of
the small molecules to primary and secondary nuclei and/or, in
the latter case, fibril surfaces. On the other hand, considering the
qualitative correlation between the inhibited processes and the
target species, one might expect that the inhibition of Aβ42 ag-
gregation by set B molecules may, in principle, originate mainly
from interactions with Aβ42 monomers. Indeed, because the mo-
nomeric species of Aβ42 are involved in all microscopic events that
underlie its aggregation, as seen in Fig. 5A (i.e., primary nucleation,
surface-catalyzed secondary nucleation, elongation), one possible
scenario, in which the small molecule inhibits all three steps, is that
it binds to the common species (i.e., the monomer in all cases). We
examined the likelihood of this scenario in a quantitative manner
by attempting a description of the kinetic data where the small
molecules sequester monomeric species of Aβ42. In this case, the
kinetic curves in the presence of increasing concentrations of the
small molecules would correspond to a decreased concentration
of Aβ42 available to aggregate. We found, however, that this as-
sumption is incorrect because the kinetic data could not be accu-
rately described (Fig. S10 A–F). Furthermore, NMR spectroscopy
measurements showed no significant perturbations of the chemical

 shifts and the resonance intensities in the heteronuclear single
quantum coherence spectra of a 25 μM sample of 15N-labeled
monomeric Aβ42 before and after the addition of each of the set B
molecules and of UVI3003, the most effective molecule of set A, as
a control (Fig. S10 G–L). These observations indicate that set B
molecules are likely to bind both primary and secondary nuclei,
and the fibril surfaces and ends, but not monomers.
Unlike set A molecules, set B molecules were found to inhibit
all three major steps in Aβ42 aggregation, with the effects on the
primary and secondary nucleation steps being greater than the
effects of the set A molecules. It is thus of great significance to
identify the chemical features responsible for these differences,
because such features can at least in principle enable the rational
design of molecules against specific microscopic steps in Aβ42
aggregation. From an analysis of the molecular properties of the
small molecules, we selected two parameters: the lipophilicity,
defined as the Ghose–Crippen octanol/water coefficient (30),
and the steric bulk, defined as the sum of the atomic van der
Waals volumes (31). We identified a linear correlation between
these two parameters that largely accounts for the efficacy of all
of the small molecules (Fig. 5B). The greater the lipophilicity and the
steric bulk, the higher is the potency of the small molecule, with very
low values of their sum corresponding to the complete abolition
of the effects of a molecule, as in the case of BMS753. Strikingly,
UVI3003, the most potent molecule in set A, was found to possess
similar lipophilicity and steric bulk values to those values in set B
molecules, and, accordingly, a similar potency is predicted from
the correlation in Fig. 5B. Although no effect was observed on the
elongation step, UVI3003 inhibits both the primary and secondary
nucleation steps to a similar degree to the molecules in set B.
These results suggest that the lipophilicity and steric bulk describe
well the effects of small molecules on the primary and secondary
nucleation steps, but not on the elongation step. To decipher the
chemical features of the small molecules responsible for inhibiting
the elongation step, we considered an additional parameter: the
value of the relative aromaticity of the small molecules, defined as
the ratio of the number of aromatic atoms to the total number of
atoms. We thus found that a high aromaticity value confers the
ability to inhibit the elongation of Aβ42 fibrils (Figs. 4 C and D
and 5B). Indeed, all of the set B molecules have aromaticity values
greater than the aromaticity values of the set A molecules.
RAR and RXR Ligands Inhibit Aβ42 Aggregation in CSF Solutions and
Rescue Aβ42-Mediated Dysfunction in a C. elegans Model. We next
explored if the small molecules retard Aβ aggregation under more
physiologically relevant conditions. We therefore monitored these
effects on the aggregation kinetics of Aβ42 in human cerebro-
spinal fluid (CSF). CSF caused a concentration-dependent re-
tardation of Aβ42 aggregation, suggesting that Aβ42 aggregation is
slower in this fluid, in line with previous results (32) (Fig. S11A).
We then investigated the effects of selected small molecules from
set A (bexarotene and UVI3003) and set B (MM11253 and ada-
palene), and from BMS753 as a negative control, under conditions
where the effect of CSF is close to maximal (i.e., 66%) (Fig.
S11B). We found that under these conditions, all selected small
molecules, except for BMS753 (Fig. S12), significantly delayed the
aggregation kinetics in a concentration-dependent manner similar
to what has been observed in buffer (Fig. 6A and Fig. S13).
We further evaluated the effects of the same small molecules
in a C. elegans model of Aβ42-mediated dysfunction, denoted
GMC101 (termed the Aβ-worm model) (22). In this model,
Aβ42 is expressed in body wall muscle cells, where it forms ag-
gregates and results in progressive paralysis (22). We assessed
the effects of the small molecules on the fitness of the worms in
terms of the frequency of body bends (i.e., motility) and the rate
of their paralysis. Because all molecules from both sets A and B
have significant effects on the nucleation steps of Aβ42 aggre-
gation, we added them at the larval stages of the C. elegans life
cycle (i.e., L4), where no aggregation of Aβ42 has occurred yet.
At day 5 of worm adulthood, where the fitness of the Aβ-worms
was significantly decreased compared with the control-worms
(Fig. S14A), the selected small molecules restored the motility of
the worms substantially, except for the negative control BMS753
(Fig. 6B), in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. S14B).
These results are similar to the results observed in vitro and in
human CSF. In addition, no selected molecules showed any
significant effect in a wild-type worm model that does not ex-
press Aβ42, N2 (termed the control-worm model) (Fig. S14C).
These data suggest that the small molecules restore the motility
of the Aβ-worms by specifically inhibiting the aggregation of
Aβ42. Indeed, the level of aggregates was measured in Aβ-worms
in the absence and presence of bexarotene using the fluorescence
intensity of the amyloid-specific dye NIAD-4, and was found to
be similar to the level of aggregates of the control-worms in the
presence of bexarotene, where no aggregates could be detected
(22). We found that all selected small molecules decreased the
rate of paralysis of the Aβ worms, except for MM11253. This
finding is in agreement with the unexpected lower increase in
the motility of the Aβ-worms in the presence of MM11253,
which was found to be extremely potent in vitro. Because no
MM11253-related toxicity could be observed, as judged from the
absence of any effect on the fitness of control worms (Fig. S14C),
this finding is likely to be due to a lower half-life of this molecule
in worms compared with adapalene, bexarotene, and UVI3003
(Fig. 6C). In any case, all molecules that have shown an effect on
the aggregation of Aβ42 in vitro are also able to restore the
fitness of the Aβ-worms, thus further supporting the power of
the kinetic assay in drug discovery. The effects of the small
molecules are also readily detectable under stress conditions,
because bexarotene (set A) and adapalene (set B) restore the
fitness, in terms of motility (Fig. S15A) and paralysis (Fig.
S15B), of Aβ-worms that were exposed to temperature-induced
stress (Fig. S15).
Conclusions
We have described a drug discovery approach based on quanti-
tative chemical kinetics to identify small molecules that target
specific microscopic steps in Aβ42 aggregation. The results that
we have obtained suggest that this approach is highly effective
for drug discovery against protein misfolding diseases because,
unlike other available approaches not based on chemical kinet-
ics, it provides quantitative descriptions of the inhibitory process,
thus making it possible to control and modulate the onset of the
aggregation in vitro. In addition, the molecules that we have
described, particularly those in set B, are expected to have a
greater effect not only on the onset of aggregation but also on
the proliferation of the Aβ42 oligomers produced through surface-
catalyzed secondary nucleation. Therefore, targeting such a pro-
cess, which is largely responsible for the production of toxic Aβ42
species (23, 24), should provide an effective means for the devel-
opment of treatments against the progression of AD. Given the
connection between the aggregation of Aβ42 and AD, and the fact
that the typical age for the onset of sporadic AD is around 65 years,
even a small delay in Aβ aggregation may postpone the onset by
long enough to reduce the risk of developing AD significantly.
Thus, inhibiting the nucleation steps in Aβ42 aggregation should
result in a delay and reduction in the formation of toxic Aβ42
oligomers (22, 23), which are considered central to the pathology of
AD; therefore it is likely to be a promising route to preventing AD.
We anticipate that the combination of QBSDD and kinetics-based
drug discovery will allow the screening of databases for the identi-
fication of pools of potent small molecules against Aβ42 aggrega-
tion. This approach will also enable the rational design of candidate
molecules bearing the chemical features that are crucial for inhib-
iting specific microscopic steps of the protein aggregation reaction,
and that possess good drug pharmacokinetic characteristics.
