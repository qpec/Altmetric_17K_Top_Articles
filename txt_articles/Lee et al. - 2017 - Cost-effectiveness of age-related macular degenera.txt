Abstract
Aims—To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) 1 & 2 
supplements in patients with either bilateral intermediate age-related macular degeneration, 
AREDS category 3, or unilateral neovascular age-related macular degeneration AMD (nAMD), 
AREDS category 4.
Methods—A patient-level health state transition model based on levels of visual acuity in the 
better-seeing eye was constructed to simulate the costs and consequences of patients taking 
AREDS vitamin supplements. Setting: UK National Health Service (NHS). The model was 
populated with data from AREDS and real-world outcomes and resource use from a prospective 
multicentre national nAMD database study containing 92 976 ranibizumab treatment episodes.

 Interventions—Two treatment approaches were compared: immediate intervention with AREDS 
supplements or no supplements. Main outcome measures: quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and 
healthcare costs were accrued for each strategy, and incremental costs and QALYs were calculated 
for the lifetime of the patient. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were employed to 
test the uncertainty of the model.
Results—For AREDS category 3, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was £30 197. For 
AREDS category 4 compared with no intervention, AREDS supplements are more effective (10.59 
vs 10.43 QALYs) and less costly (£52 074 vs 54 900) over the lifetime of the patient.
Conclusions—The recommendation to publicly fund AREDS supplements to category 3 
patients would depend on the healthcare system willingness to pay. In contrast, initiating AREDS 
supplements in AREDS category 4 patients is both cost saving and more effective than no 
supplement use and should therefore be considered in public health policy.
Introduction
Despite the introduction of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents for the 
treatment of neovascular form of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), AMD remains 
the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment in the Western world and is expected to 
increase in incidence with an ageing population.1 Delivery of anti-VEGF agents is not only 
burdensome, costly, and invasive, but also associated with eventual visual reduction in many 
cases.2 Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF drugs, ranibizumab and afilibercept, is an 
established therapy to treat neovascular AMD (nAMD) in the UK National Health Service 
(NHS). In the UK, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
recommended the use of ranibizumab in August 2008,3 leading to almost exclusive usage of 
ranibizumab for nAMD in the UK NHS until the additional recommendation of afilibercept 
in 2013.4 In clinical trials, afilibercept was shown to be non-inferior to ranibizumab,5 and in 
clinical practice, outcomes of both drugs are similar if given in a similar dosing schedule.6
Given the burden and cost of treatment, prevention of nAMD seems therefore an attractive 
strategy to avoid the chronic and costly anti-VEGF therapies and preserve visual function. 
The Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) demonstrated that AMD patients who have at 
least one eye with early/ intermediate disease who take particular combinations of high-dose 
antioxidant vitamin plus zinc supplements daily are at a reduced risk of developing nAMD. 
This intervention did not prevent the progression to late atrophic AMD significantly, 
although there was a trend to benefit.7 A further study, AREDS2, evaluated the efficacy and 
safety of lutein plus zeaxanthin and/or omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated acid 
supplementation in reducing the risk of developing advanced AMD.8 AREDS2 results 
suggest that lutein/zeaxanthin could be more appropriate than beta-carotene in the AREDS1 
supplements and would avoid concerns about potential increased cancer risk associated with 
beta-carotene in ex or current smokers.9 Although there are other studies evaluating 
alternative combinations of nutritional supplements to AREDS to protect from progression 
to late AMD, trials other than AREDS reveal little evidence for effectiveness of antioxidant 
vitamin and mineral supplements for preventing visual loss or progression of the disease.10 
The Cochrane systematic review stated that as AREDS is a large, well-conducted

 randomised study; potential biases will have been minimised, hence this study concentrated 
on AREDS.10
A number of studies have evaluated the potential public health impact of AREDS 
supplements. Bressler and coworkers estimated that as many as 300 000 cases of advanced 
AMD could be avoided in the USA over 5 years if all eligible patients took vitamin 
supplements containing antioxidants plus zinc; however, the study did not consider the 
economic impact.11 Other studies assessed the cost-effectiveness of vitamin supplements but 
had limitations relating to the standard of care comparison (eg, included screening or 
excluded anti-VEGF therapy) or had limitations in the underlying model (eg, used a 
monocular model).12 Hopley et al did estimate the cost-effectiveness of vitamins 
(approximately $31 800 (£18 948) in 2003—per quality-adjusted life year (QALY)) but 
included the cost of diagnostic screening as part of the vitamin intervention and did not 
include the cost burden of treating nAMD.13 A more recent study from Japan addressed the 
issues of visual loss at a binocular level and the cost of treating nAMD but included the cost 
of screening in the analysis. In addition, the study initiated AREDS intervention when 
‘prodromal’ symptoms occurred and used Japanese costings.14 However, they each have 
limitations if translated to the current state of AMD management, with the widespread use of 
anti-VEGF agents to treat nAMD. Anti-VEGF therapy was not routinely available by 2007 
when three of the four studies were completed. In addition, economic modelling has evolved 
since 2007, and none of the papers to date adequately looked at the disorder at a patient level 
as opposed to individual eye level. Patient level analysis has implications in terms of impact 
on patient function if choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) develops in the better seeing eye 
using similar models to those used in NICE health economic reviews.4
In the UK, currently, there is no formal screening for intermediate or late AMD as defined 
by Beckman classification,15 approximately equivalent to AREDS category 3 and 4 patients.
At present, AREDS-type formulations are not routinely funded or prescribed throughout the 
UK, with some exceptions based on local prescribing rules. Even though AREDS had a 
positive outcome, organisations like NICE have not evaluated these supplements for cost-
effectiveness possibly as they are not licenced as a drug, although NICE may consider 
evaluations of public health interventions. In contrast, the Veterans Administration in the 
USA has provided AREDS supplements to patients for public health reasons
This study uses an economic model to investigate the cost-effectiveness of prescribing 
antioxidants plus zinc (either AREDS 1 or 2 formulations or AREDS 2 for current or ex-
smokers) for cases of AMD diagnosed in the course of routine ophthalmic eye care 
compared with no use of AREDS supplements. We did not model the effect of either 
antioxidants alone or zinc alone. For clarity, we will define AREDS supplements in this 
manuscript to contain 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 International Units of vitamin E, 15 mg of 
beta-carotene; 80 mg of zinc and 2 mg of copper, and AREDS2 supplements to contain 500 
mg of vitamin C, 400 International Units of vitamin E, 10 mg lutein and 2 mg zeaxanthin, 
80 mg of zinc and 2 mg of copper. Both formulations are commercially available from a 
variety of manufacturers. We determined the impact of taking AREDS supplements for all 
patients older than 55 years with AMD using UK cost and prevalence data.

 Methods
Patient population
Patients with either AREDS category 3, bilateral intermediate age-related macular 
degeneration, or AREDS category four subgroup with unilateral nAMD that have previously 
been shown to benefit from AREDS 1 or 2 supplements were the population of patients 
modelled.
Model structure
A Markov approach was used to develop a patient level, binocular simulation model using 1 
month cycles. At the beginning of the simulation, two paired virtual patients were simulated 
with the same age, gender, disease state of both eyes and visual acuity of both eyes (online 
supplementary figure 1). One patient was assigned to be treated with AREDS supplements, 
and the other virtual patient was assigned to no treatment. At each simulation cycle, 
probability of death was applied using linearly interpolated life tables for the corresponding 
age and gender. Disease progression, treatment costs and utility were calculated at each 
cycle. Utility was calculated using the best vision of the two eyes using Brown et al for the 
base case.16 The time horizon for each patient was until the patient died.
Category 3 simulation
At the beginning of the simulation, the age and gender of the paired virtual patients were 
drawn from scaled beta distributions fitted to the data collected from the AREDS trial for 
category 3 (online supplementary figure 2). Both eyes were set to intermediate AMD, and 
the vision of both eyes were also drawn from scaled beta distributions from the starting 
vision of category 3 patients in the AREDS trial. Using the Kaplan-Meier curve of category 
3 patients' time to development of neovascularisation in the first eye in the AREDS trial, the 
time to development of CNV was sampled for one random eye depending on which 
treatment group the virtual patient was in. Time to development of the second eye was 
sampled from the Kaplan-Meier curve using the category 4a with prior neovascularisation. A 
conservative approach was used in that if the time horizon extended past the end of the 
AREDS trial data (5 years), then the patient was assumed to not have progressed to nAMD 
in the corresponding eye.
Category 4a with prior neovascularisation simulation
At the beginning of the simulation, the age and gender of the paired virtual patients were 
drawn from scaled beta distributions fit to the data collected from the AREDS trial for 
category 4a with prior neovascularisation (online supplementary figure 3). One eye was set 
to intermediate AMD, and the other eye was set to nAMD. The vision of both eyes were also 
drawn from scaled beta distributions from the starting vision of category 4a with prior 
neovascularisation in the AREDS trial depending on the disease state. Using the Kaplan-
Meier curve of category 4a with prior neovascularisation time to development of 
neovascularisation in the second eye in the AREDS trial, the time to development of CNV 
was sampled for the intermediate AMD eye. A conservative approach was used in that if the

 time horizon extended past the end of the AREDS trial data (5 years), then the patient was 
assumed to not have progressed to nAMD.
Progression modeling
In both models, once progression to CNV occurred, the starting vision was adjusted by 
drawing from a scaled beta distribution of change in Early Treatment of Diabetic 
Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) letters from baseline as noted in the AREDS trial when CNV 
occurred. If the patient's vision after progression to CNV was better than 6/12 (20/40), the 
patient eye was deferred treatment based on the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data.14 
Once the vision fell below 6/12, the patient's eye was entered into the Markov model for 
transitioning visual acuities.
The Markov model after initiating treatment for nAMD consisted of five health states: five 
health states defined by declining visual acuity (VA) ranging from 6/12 or better (least 
severe) to less than 3/60 (most severe). This model structure was consistent with the model 
developed by the Evidence Review Group (ERG) in the original NICE appraisal of 
ranibizumab for nAMD.3
A patient was then treated with three initial monthly ranibizumab injections followed by pro 
re nata (PRN). Using the EMR data, the probability of requiring an injection in the first year 
of treatment following the first three injections was calculated. For years beyond the first 
year, the probability of requiring an anti-VEGF injection each month was assumed to be the 
same as measured in the second year. These monthly probabilities were drawn from a scaled 
beta distribution after fitting to the EMR data. Patients were charged for monthly visits after 
beginning treatment in the first eye. After both eyes progressed to wet AMD, the AREDS 
supplement were stopped. Each model and sensitivity analysis was run for a total of 100 000 
virtual patients in each arm.
Perspective
The perspective of the model was the UK NHS and Personal Social Services as 
recommended in the NICE Guide to the Methods of Technology Appraisal reference case.17 
The model was run until the absorbing state of death was reached, which represented the 
time horizon used in pivotal trials. Owing to the long horizon, costs and benefits were 
modelled with discounting of 1.5% per year as recommended for public health interventions.
Utility
Benefits were measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). VA was converted to utility 
for the calculation of QALYs using Brown et al,13 which elicited utilities in 80 patients with 
AMD using the time trade-off method and grouped these by the VA health states defined in 
the model. The health state utility values used in the model are reported in table 1 and are 
consistent with those applied to the model used by the ERG in the original NICE appraisal 
of ranibizumab for nAMD.18 Utilities were accumulated for the best vision of the two eyes.

 Costs
Resource use and costs were applied to reflect UK clinical practice. Resource use consisted 
of regular assessment visits once nAMD was diagnosed and ranibizumab injection given on 
a PRN basis. At the start of treatment, patients received three initiating doses of ranibizumab 
as recommended by clinical guidance followed PRN injections at a frequency calculated 
from the data set. UK unit costs were assigned for a cost year of 2012. A cost of 
ranibizumab of £551.00 per injection, an assessment cost of £255.00 and a monitoring cost 
of £60.00 were used.1920 These costs were consistent with the NICE costing template for 
afilibercept.21
Sensitivity analysis
Appropriate probability functions were fitted to model parameters to incorporate uncertainty. 
Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed using a Monte Carlo simulation to randomly 
sample each parameter. Utilities were characterised by a β distribution, with α and β 
parameters defined by the means and SDs of the utilities. Costs were characterised by a γ 
distribution with α and β parameters defined by the means and SDs of the costs. SDs were 
not available for costs, therefore they were assumed to be 10% of the mean in line with 
recommended practice for health economic models. Transition probabilities were 
characterised by a beta distribution. For each probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) 
parameter, 200 000 virtual patients were simulated until death. A total of 1000 PSA 
simulations were run for each model. One-way sensitivity analysis was employed to test 
structural uncertainty within the model.
AREDS data set
Investigators of this study had full access to the cleaned but unanalysed AREDS data set to 
develop this model. Details of AREDS design have been previously published and are 
briefly described.22 Between 13 November 1992 and 15 January 1998, 4757 persons aged 
55–80 years at the time of enrolment were entered into the study at 11 clinical centres. The 
ocular eligibility requirements were largely determined by the AMD component findings of 
AREDS. Macular status was assessed, using the AREDS system for classifying age-related 
macular degeneration,22 by trained and certified readers at a reading centre, based on 
stereoscopic colour fundus photographs taken at baseline and at regular intervals during 
follow-up. Except for the requirement that all participants have at least one eye with a VA of 
20/32 or better and that the media be sufficiently clear for reasonable quality fundus 
photography, no other exclusion criteria were applied. VA was measured in each eye by the 
ETDRS method as the number of letters read correctly. AREDS2 data were not used as there 
was no placebo group in the study.23
EMR data set
We have previously described the methodology of obtaining the large data set of 92 976 
ranibizumab injections,1718 as well as the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of treating 
with ranibizumab at VAs better than 6/12,2425 which covered data from the approval of 
ranibizumab in August 2008 until April 2012. In brief, 14 NHS hospitals that deliver 
ranibizumab AMD treatment services in England and Northern Ireland submitted data to this

 study. Each site is the only NHS provider of nAMD care to their local population and very 
few patients switch between providers. Following NICE approval for the use of ranibizumab 
for nAMD in the NHS in August 2008, all sites used this drug almost exclusively. The lead 
clinician and Caldicott Guardian (who oversees data protection) at each centre gave written 
approval for the data extraction. Patient identifiers were completely stripped out, and site 
and clinician data were pseudoanonymised, and on this basis an ethics committee 
determined that formal ethics approval was not required. This study was conducted in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the UK's Data Protection Act. The 14 sites 
entered their first treatment episodes into the EMR system during the following years: 2006 
(n=2 sites), 2007 (n=5), 2008 (n=4), 2009 (n=1) and 2010 (n=2). The first recorded 
ranibizumab injection was dated November 2006. Over the period of data collection, anti-
VEGF treatment was performed in 13 774 patients, of whom 2639 received anti-VEGF for 
reasons other than nAMD or received bevacizumab. Thus, this study analyses data on 12 951 
eyes of 11 135 patients who received a total of 92 976 ranibizumab injections during 317 
371 clinic visits at 14 UK hospitals. In total, 16.3% (n=1816) of these patients required 
treatment to both eyes during the follow-up period. The demographics of the patients 
included have previously been described and are summarised in the online supplementary 
material table 1. ‘Best-measured VA’ was the best VA with refraction or habitual correction 
and/or pinhole as measured on ETDRS chart and expressed as ETDRS letters and LogMAR 
vision in this study.
Missing EMR data
For patients whose data were not available for a particular visit or had been lost to follow-
up, no missing value substitutions were performed. The only exception to this rule was the 
baseline VA, as some treatment centres brought patients back for a two-stop service—
assessment on first visit followed by injection on second visit and did not repeat VA 
measurements on the date of the first injection (n=1670), which was always performed 
within 3 weeks. This was therefore not missing data per se but reflects variation in treatment 
delivery. In the model, we assumed no differences between centres for resource use 
associated with service delivery.
Results
The simulation results showing transitioning of patients into different AMD states or death is 
summarised in figure 1a for AREDS 3 patients and figure 1b for AREDS category 4 patients 
over 600 months.
For AREDS category 3, our model showed that the treatment group accumulated 13 785 
GBP (US$17 780) per patient lifetime, whereas the untreated group accumulated 12 879 
GBP (US$16 611 USD) per patient lifetime. Accumulated health benefits were 11.53 
QALYs per patient in the treatment group compared with 11.52 QALYs per patient in the 
treatment group. This translates to a beneficial intervention driven by a mean of 3.07 fewer 
anti-VEGF injections in the treated group but at increased cost with an incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 30 197. PSA analysis showed similar trends, and the one way 
sensitivities are shown in table 2 & figure 2.

 For AREDS category 4a with prior neovascularisation, our model showed that the treatment 
group accumulated 52 074 GBP (US$67 165 USD) per patient lifetime, whereas the 
untreated group accumulated 54 900 GBP (US$70 810) per patient lifetime. Accumulated 
health benefits were 10.59 QALYs in the treatment group compared with 10.43 QALYs in 
the treatment group. This translates to a cost-negative yet beneficial intervention driven by a 
mean of 7.67 fewer anti-VEGF injections in the treated group. PSA analysis showed similar 
trends and the one-way sensitivities are shown in table 3 and figure 3.
Discussion
Intervention with AREDS supplements is likely to be a dominant cost-effective strategy in 
category 4 patients with neovascularisation in one eye. Over the lifetime of the patient, 
patients received an average 7.67 less intravitreal injection (lower cost) and gained 0.16 
QALYs compared with no use of supplements. In patients with bilateral intermediate AMD, 
AREDS category 3, the ICER of £30,197 versus current treatment practice is just above the 
threshold of £20,000–30,000 per QALY, which is often considered the NHS's willingness to 
pay.
Numerous nutritional supplements are available commercially, but very few robust studies 
have been conducted. A Cochrane review identified one large study (AREDS) that has 
minimal bias that is of benefit in patient with AMD. The same report stated that other 
smaller trials with shorter follow-up do not provide evidence of any benefit.10 This health 
economic evaluation concentrated therefore on the AREDS supplements from the AREDS 
trial and assumed equivalency of AREDS2 supplements, data from which were not available 
at the time of the Cochrane review. What has not been demonstrated clearly to date is their 
cost-effectiveness using a health economic model for the UK setting, using data from both 
eyes and the costings and implications of developing nAMD requiring treatment with anti-
VEGF (ranibizumab or aflibercept).
This study demonstrates that intervention with AREDS supplements (1 or 2) would be a 
dominant health intervention, as it both lowers costs and leads to better visual outcomes. 
This is an intervention that would be on the ‘south- east corner’ of the cost effectiveness 
plane, and so an estimated ICER is not reported.26
The main driver of cost-effectiveness is the cost of anti-VEGF therapy; therefore, if costs of 
therapy were to come down significantly, through the widespread use of avastin for example, 
the results may change. However, we tested different prices in one-way sensitivity analysis 
and found results for category 4 AREDS to remain a dominant intervention.
Risks of supplements
Several factors may be considered regarding the potential risks or side effects. First, in the 
original AREDS report, hospitalisations for genitourinary diseases were significantly more 
common in participants randomised to receive AREDS supplements than to receive placebo 
(11% vs 8%). These hospitalisations were mainly due to urinary tract infections in men and 
were not related to malignancies nor were associated with increased mortality in the zinc 
group. However, in AREDS2, rates of reported gastrointestinal disorders and hospitalisations

 for genitourinary diseases were similar in the two randomly assigned groups (high-dose zinc 
and low-dose zinc). Second, AREDS supplements reduce the burden of nAMD that require 
anti-VEGF agents, which is associated with a risk of endophthalmitis and possible excess 
stroke risk. In a pooled analysis of 2-year controlled studies, the stroke rate was 2.7% in 
patients treated with 0.5 mg ranibizumab compared with 1.1% in patients in the control arms 
(OR 2.2, 95% CI 0.8 to 7.1). Third, the long-term safety profile of lutein/zeaxanthin 
supplementation is not well-known. The substitution of these compounds for beta-carotene, 
seems reasonable, given their potential benefit as well as safety concerns related to increased 
risk of lung cancer in smokers using beta-carotene containing supplements,27 and the 
findings of AREDS2 that there were more lung cancers noted in the beta-carotene versus no 
beta-carotene group (23 (2.0%) vs 11 (0.9%), nominal p=0.04), mostly in former smokers. 
Our model assumed that current or ex-smokers used AREDS2 supplements, and no 
alteration in lung cancer burden or mortality was assumed. However, possible long-term 
effects and possible adverse events associated with lutein/zeaxanthin supplementation are 
not yet known, although there seems to be no medium-term adverse events.
AREDS2
While primary analysis from the AREDS2 did not reveal additional benefit of daily 
supplementation with lutein/zeaxanthin on AMD progression, secondary exploratory 
analyses suggested that lutein/zeaxanthin were helpful in reducing this risk.927 We assumed 
equivalency of AREDS1 supplements and AREDS2 combination of substituting beta-
carotene.
Limitations
We did not model the risks of possible excess hospital admissions due to genitourinary 
problems that may be associated with AREDS or the reduced risk of endophthalmitis or 
possible stroke that AREDS could prevent by reducing anti-VEGF injection need. Given the 
cost of managing stroke and endophthalmitis is likely to be greater than the cost of 
managing a slight increase in genitourinary problems, this is unlikely to alter the conclusions 
of our analysis.
We assumed excellent compliance of AREDS supplements in patients in category 4 AREDS 
with nAMD in the first eye, as they would likely be highly motivated to prevent visual loss 
in the second eye. A survey of European ophthalmologists suggest that 29% of stage 4 
AREDS patients were non-compliant taking them, which is similar to the 20% non-
compliance rate in the original AREDS.928 However, it may be that compliance is poor in 
category 3 AREDS patients. A possible public health strategy may be only to actively supply 
AREDS to category 4 nAMD patients, given that 11% of patient with AREDS did not take 
AREDS supplements in a survey citing cost as a main factor.28
We believe that an evaluation of the clinical and economic impacts of AREDS supplements 
as a public health intervention would be warranted by NICE. While we have not estimated 
the full budget impact of introducing AREDS supplements in the UK, we estimate that the 
cost of such an intervention in the first year in category 4 patients would be £6.99 million 
per year, assuming all patients take AREDS supplements with similar compliance as 
Lee et al.

 AREDS (based on Owen et al estimate of 31 006 new cases of nAMD per year and the 
proportion that would be unilateral).2930 This would be offset over the lifetime of the patient 
through fewer intravitreal injections. Undiscounted, this could save £131 million of 
ranibizumab injections over a lifetime for this first year cohort based on the costs and 
treatment strategies used in this model.
In conclusion, this model demonstrates that the use AREDS supplements is a dominant cost-
effective intervention for use for AREDS category 4a patients with nAMD in one eye in the 
UK.
Previous studies have supported the effectiveness of AREDS supplements for category 3 and 
4 patients. From this study, the recommendation to publicly fund AREDS supplements to 
category 3 patients would depend on the healthcare system willingness to pay. In contrast 
AREDS supplements are a dominant cost-effective intervention for category 4 AREDS 
patients, as they are both less expensive than standard care and more effective and therefore 
should be considered for public funding.
