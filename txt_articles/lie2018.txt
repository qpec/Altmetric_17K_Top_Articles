ABSTRACT
OBJECTIVES The goal of this study was to explore the association between exercise duration versus exercise intensity
and adverse outcome in patients with arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (AC).
BACKGROUND Vigorous exercise aggravates and accelerates AC, but there are no data assessing the harmful effects of
exercise intensity and duration in these patients.
METHODS Exercise habits at time of diagnosis were recorded by standardized interviews in consecutive AC patients.
Exercise >6 metabolic equivalents was defined as high intensity, and exercise duration was categorized as long if above
median. Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (VA) was defined as aborted cardiac arrest, documented sustained
ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, or appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.
RESULTS We included 173 AC patients (53% probands; 44% female; 41 � 16 years of age). Median weekly exercise
duration was 2.5 h (interquartile range: 2.0 to 5.5 h), and 91 patients (52%) reported high-intensity exercise. VA had
occurred in 83 patients (48%) and was more prevalent in patients with high-intensity exercise than low-intensity exercise
(74% vs. 20%, p < 0.001), and more prevalent in long-duration than short-duration exercise (65% vs. 31%, p < 0.001).
High-intensity exercise was a strong and independent marker of VA, even when adjusted for the interaction with
long-duration exercise (odds ratio: 3.8; 95% confidence interval: 1.3 to 11.0, p < 0.001), whereas long-duration exercise
was not.
CONCLUSIONS High-intensity exercise was a strong and independent marker of life-threatening VA in AC patients,
independent of exercise duration. AC patients could be advised to restrict their exercise intensity. (J Am Coll Cardiol EP

A
rrhythmogenic
cardiomyopathy
(AC),
also
known as arrhythmogenic right ventricular
cardiomyopathy, is an inheritable heart dis-
ease associated with a high risk of life-threatening
ventricular
arrhythmia
(VA)
and
sudden
cardiac
death in apparently healthy young individuals. It is
a disease of the cardiac desmosomes (1), with an esti-
mated mutation prevalence of up to 1 in 1,000 (2).
Dysfunctional desmosomes result in reduced wall-
stress tolerance, which leads to cardiac remodeling
with an early predilection of the right ventricle (RV),
as well as involvement of the left ventricle (LV) (3).

 Regular physical activity is a cornerstone
of a healthy lifestyle and is recommended to
healthy adults (4). Athletes commonly exer-
cise in vast excess of the recommended
minimum doses (5) for healthy individuals.
Vigorous exercise aggravates and accelerates
AC disease, and athletes are overrepresented
in AC patient cohorts (6–8). Athletes are
accustomed to an active lifestyle and are
often concerned about the inactivity and
exercise restrictions recommended in the
treatment guidelines during the past decade
(9–11).
There
is
no
established
exercise
threshold associated with adverse outcome
in AC, and data considering harmful effects
of different types of exercise are lacking. Previous
studies have reported the total exercise dose or
perceived activity level of AC patients (6,12) without
separating the impact of exercise intensity and exer-
cise duration. We aimed to explore the impact of ex-
ercise intensity, exercise duration, and exercise dose
on outcome in AC patients.
METHODS
STUDY POPULATION. We included consecutive pa-
tients diagnosed with AC at the Department of Car-
diology,
Oslo
University
Hospital,
Rikshospitalet,
Oslo, Norway, between January 2008 and November
2016 in an observational cohort study. Probands ful-
filling AC diagnosis by the current Task Force Criteria
(1) underwent genetic testing, and family members of
probands with pathogenic mutations were screened
and included if mutation positive (1). We defined a
proband as the first person in a family to exhibit
clinical symptoms or signs that triggered an evalua-
tion of AC. Patients with heart or lung comorbidities
were excluded. We performed a clinical examination
and recorded any use of AC-related medication. VA,
the primary outcome, was defined as a history of 1 or
more of the following events: aborted cardiac arrest,
documented sustained ventricular tachycardia (>100
beats/min, >30 s) (13) on electrocardiogram or Holter
recordings or appropriate implantable cardioverter-
defibrillator (ICD) therapy at last clinical follow-up.
Appropriate
ICD
therapy
was
defined
as
anti-
tachycardia pacing or shock therapy for documented
ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. VA
and age at the first documented VA were recorded
retrospectively by an independent observer blinded
to exercise data. Cardiac function and dimensions,
the secondary outcomes, were assessed by echocar-
diography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging
(CMR). Written informed consent was given by all
patients, and the study complied with the Declaration
of Helsinki and was approved by the Regional Com-
mittee for Medical Research Ethics in Norway.
EXERCISE. At time of diagnosis, we advised our AC
patients to abstain from competitive sports (11). We
interviewed all patients about their exercise habits
immediately before their AC diagnosis, either by
direct interview during their clinical visit or by tele-
phone calls. Exercise was defined as physical activity
performed on a regular basis during the past 3 years
(14). Duration of exercise was defined as the actual
time in motion and was expressed as average hours
per week, which allowed for seasonal variation. Me-
dian duration of exercise in our cohort served as the
cutoff to categorize exercise duration as short or long.
Exercise intensity was assigned from the main re-
ported exercise activity using the 2011 Compendium
of Physical Activities (15) and was expressed as
metabolic equivalents (METs). Patients were classi-
fied as regularly engaging in high-intensity exercise
(>6
METs),
for
example,
running,
aerobics,
fast
swimming,
or
competitive
sports
(16),
or
low-
intensity
exercise
(3
to
6
METs),
for
example,
walking, dancing, or weight lifting. Regular physical
activity <3 METs was not recorded as exercise. On the
basis of exercise intensity and duration, we catego-
rized patients into 4 groups:
1. Low-intensity
and
short-duration
exercise
(low/short);
2. Low-intensity
and
long-duration
exercise
(low/long);
3. High-intensity
and
short-duration
exercise
(high/short);
4. High-intensity
and
long-duration
exercise
(high/long)
The exercise dose was calculated by multiplying
the exercise intensity in METs by the weekly exer-
cise duration in hours and was expressed as MET-h/
week (14).
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM. All patients underwent a
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at the time of diag-
nosis, and major and minor criteria according to the
2010 AC Task Force Criteria (1) were assessed. A
signal-averaged ECG was also obtained at the time of
diagnosis (MAC 5000, GE Medical Systems, Milwau-
kee, Wisconsin) in a subgroup of patients. A patho-
logical signal-averaged ECG was defined according to
the 2010 AC Task Force Criteria (1).

group

Cardiac Structure and Function Outcomes
By cardiac imaging, we defined the secondary outcomes as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction (top), right ventricular (RV) dilation (bottom left),
and RV dysfunction (bottom right). (Top) LV dysfunction was defined as (a) ejection fraction <54% in female patients and <52% in male
patients or (b) global longitudinal strain (GLS) worse than –18%. (Bottom left) RV dilation was defined as (a) proximal RV outflow tract (RVOT)
diameter $32 mm in parasternal short-axis view, (b) basal RV diameter (RVD) >41 mm in RV focused apical 4-chamber view (blue arrows), or
(c) major criterion indexed RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDVi) by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. (Bottom right) RV dysfunction was
defined as (a) fractional area change #40%, (b) tricuspid annular systolic excursion <17 mm, or (c) major criterion RV ejection fraction by
cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Blue arrows and areas are end-diastolic measures, and red are end-systolic measures.

previously
(7).
The
presence
of
RV
contraction
abnormalities was recorded, and the major Task Force
Criteria (1) were included in the imaging endpoints of
RV dilation and dysfunction.
ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY. All
participants
underwent
echocardiography at the time of AC diagnosis (Vivid 7,
E9 or E95, GE, Vingmed, Horten, Norway), and data-
sets
were
analyzed
offline
(EchoPac
201,
GE,
Vingmed) by 2 independent observers blinded to
clinical and exercise information. LV ejection fraction
was assessed by the Simpson biplane method. LV
global longitudinal strain was assessed by the speckle
tracking technique and calculated as the average peak
negative longitudinal strain in a 16-segment model
(17).
LV
dysfunction
was
defined
as
ejection
fraction
<54%
in
females and 52%
in
males
or
global longitudinal strain worse than �18% (Figure 1)
(18–20).
RV function and dimensions were assessed by
echocardiographic
RV
fractional
area
change,
tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion, proximal
diameter of RV outflow tract, RV basal diameter (21),
and CMR parameters. RV dilation was defined as RV
basal diameter >41 mm, RV outflow tract $32 mm
(Figure
1),
or
indexed
RV
end-diastolic
volume
$100 ml/m2 in females and $110 ml/m2 in males with
concomitant RV akinesia/dyskinesia by CMR (1). RV
dysfunction was defined as fractional area change
#40%, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion
<17 mm (Figure 1) (22), or RV ejection fraction #40%
with concomitant RV akinesia/dyskinesia by CMR (1).
GENETIC
ANALYSES. Genomic
DNA
was
isolated
from peripheral blood, and testing was performed as
a
part
of
the
diagnostic
workup
as
described
previously (7).
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS. Values are expressed as
mean � SD, frequencies with percentages, or median
with interquartile range (IQR) and were compared by
Student t test, chi-squared test, Fisher exact test, or
Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate (SPSS version
21.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were computed for exer-
cise parameters to identify patients with adverse
outcome, and the curve coordinate closest to the
upper
left
corner
was
defined
as
the
statistical
optimal
threshold
value.
Logistical
regression
analyses
were
performed
in
patients
with
long-
and short-duration exercise, in patients with high-
and low-intensity exercise, and in patients with and
without VA. Possible confounders (p < 0.10) were
added to multivariable logistical regression for the
primary endpoint, including an interaction term for
high-intensity
and
long-duration
exercise.
Multi-
collinearity was defined by correlation coefficients
>0.7 or variance inflation factor >5 (23). The distri-
butions of outcomes across the 4 groups of high- or
low-intensity and short- or long-duration exercise
were presented as modified radar plots that reflected
the prevalence of outcomes as a percentage of the
length from the center of the diagram to the respec-
tive corner. Distributions of outcomes around the
axes were compared by chi-squared test. The p values
were 2-sided, and values <0.05 were considered
significant.
RESULTS
Of 191 patients diagnosed with AC at our center, 11
had heart or lung comorbidities and 7 were unavail-
able for exercise interview, which left 173 included
patients (53% probands; 44% female; 41 � 16 years of
age) (Table 1) with detailed exercise information and
data on the primary outcome. An ECG was available in
all 173 patients, and a satisfactory signal-averaged

 ECG was available in 139 (80%). Five patients had
unsatisfactory
echocardiographic
acquisitions
of
either LV or RV, and thus, 168 patients (97%) were
analyzed for all the secondary outcomes (LV and RV
dysfunction and RV dilation). CMR was performed in
134 patients (79%). Genetic analyses had been per-
formed in 170 patients, of whom 125 (72%) had path-
ogenic mutations (109 [87%] in plakophilin-2, 8 [6%]
in desmoplakin, 7 [6%] in desmoglein-2, and 2 [2%] in
desmocollin-2
genes).
Forty-five
patients
were
mutation-negative probands with definite AC, and 3
probands
with
definite
AC
were
not
genetically
tested. As expected, probands had more severe dis-
ease than family members (Table 1).
Seventeen patients had experienced aborted car-
diac arrest, 70 had documented sustained ventricular
tachycardia, and 49 had received appropriate ICD
therapy (Online Table). In total, VA had occurred in
83 patients (34% female; age 40 � 16 years). Patients
with VA were more frequently probands (86% vs. 6%,
p < 0.001) and had more prevalent LV dysfunction
(52% vs. 27%; p ¼ 0.001), RV dysfunction (83% vs.
47%, p < 0.001), and RV dilation (93% vs. 59%;
p < 0.001) than patients without VA.
EXERCISE
DURATION:
LONG
VERSUS
SHORT. Median
weekly exercise duration was 2.5 h (IQR: 2.0 to 5.5 h).
According to the predefined cutoff, 86 patients were
classified
as
regularly
engaging
in
long-duration
exercise (>2.5 h/week), and 87 as participating in
short-duration exercise (#2.5 h/week) (Table 2).
Ventricular
arrhythmia. Long-duration
exercise
was more common in males and in probands and was
associated
with
VA,
but
none
of
these
markers
remained when adjusted for confounders (Table 2).
Exercise duration $2.3 h/week was the statistical
threshold associated with VA (C-statistic, 0.69; 95%
CI: 0.61 to 0.77).
Functional
and
structural
alterations. Patients
with long-duration exercise had worse LV and RV
function,
and
more
RV
dilation,
than
patients
with short exercise duration. There was a trend
towards
an
association
between
long-duration
exercise and RV dilation in multivariable analysis
(p ¼ 0.07). The statistical threshold associated with RV
dilation was $2.8 h of exercise per week, $3.2 h/week
with RV dysfunction, and $3.4 h/week with LV
dysfunction.
EXERCISE INTENSITY: HIGH VERSUS LOW. The mean
exercise intensity was 6.7 � 1.9 METs. High-intensity
exercise (>6 METs) was reported by 91 patients, and
82 reported low-intensity exercise (3 to 6 METs)
(Table 3). High-intensity exercise was more common
in males, probands, and patients reporting long-
duration exercise.
Ventricular
arrhythmia. Patients
with
high-
intensity exercise had more prevalent VA than pa-
tients with low-intensity exercise, an association that
remained strong in multivariable analysis (Table 3).
Male sex, long-duration exercise, and high-intensity
exercise were markers of VA in univariable logistical
regression, and higher age was a possible confounder.
High-intensity exercise and the interaction between
high-intensity and long-duration exercise were in-
dependent markers of VA in multivariable analysis
(Table 4). In a subgroup analysis of mutation-positive
family members (n ¼ 82), VA occurred in 5 (6%), and
all of them reported high-intensity exercise (23% vs.
0%, p ¼ 0.001).
Functional
and
structural
alterations. Patients
reporting high-intensity exercise had worse LV and
RV function and more RV dilation than patients

 reporting
low-intensity
exercise,
but
not
when
adjusted for confounders (Table 3). ROC analyses
suggested exercise intensities between 6 and 7 METs
as the optimal statistical threshold values for detect-
ing VA (C-statistic, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.85) and for
all secondary outcomes (LV and RV dysfunction and
RV dilation).
COMBINATIONS
OF
EXERCISE
DURATION
AND
INTENSITY. The distributions of outcomes in the 4
groups stratified by high or low intensity and long or
short duration of exercise shown on the modified
radar plots (Figure 2) revealed that VA was most
prevalent in high/long exercise (Figure 2A). Interest-
ingly, VA was more prevalent among patients with
high/short exercise than patients with low/long ex-
ercise (Figure 3). LV dysfunction was most prevalent
in high/long exercise and significantly more preva-
lent
than
in
low/short
exercise
(Figure
2B).
RV
dysfunction was also more prevalent in high/long
exercise than in both groups of low-intensity exercise
(Figure 2C). RV dilatation was more prevalent in high/
long exercise than in both groups of short duration
but not different from patients with low/long exer-
cise (Figure 2D).
EXERCISE DOSE. Median exercise dose was 18 MET-
h/week (IQR: 12 to 41 MET-h/week) and was higher
in probands (Table 1) and men (36 MET-h/week [IQR:
14 to 55 MET-h/week] vs. 12 MET-h/week [IQR: 9 to 22
MET-h/week] in women, p < 0.001).

DISCUSSION
This study supports the previously reported rela-
tionship between exercise and AC disease and shows
for the first time that high-intensity exercise has a
stronger association with adverse outcome than long
exercise duration. These findings suggest that high-
intensity exercise is the main premise for harmful
effects of exercise in AC and could be helpful when
giving exercise advice to AC patients.
EXERCISE DURATION. Long-duration exercise was
associated
with
adverse
outcome;
however,
the
majority of patients with a history of long-duration
exercise also had a history of high-intensity exer-
cise. Adjusted for high-intensity exercise and other

Distribution of Outcomes
Modified radar plots of the distributions of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia (VA), LV dysfunction, RV dysfunction, and RV dilation across
4 groups of high- and low-intensity exercise (x-axis) and long- and short-duration exercise (y-axis). The p value by chi-squared test for the
distribution of outcomes across 4 groups of intensity/duration as stated. (A) VAs (red): VA was more prevalent in high-intensity/long-duration
exercise than in high-intensity/short-duration (82% vs. 52%, p ¼ 0.004), low-intensity/long-duration (82% vs. 10%, p < 0.001), or low-
intensity/short-duration exercise (82% vs. 23%, p < 0.001) and more prevalent in patients reporting high-intensity/short-duration exercise
than in low-intensity/long-duration (52% vs. 10%, p ¼ 0.003) or low-intensity/short-duration exercise (52% vs. 23%, p ¼ 0.007). (B) LV
dysfunction (blue): LV dysfunction was more prevalent in high-intensity/long-duration exercise than in low-intensity/short-duration exercise
(55% vs. 25%, p ¼ 0.001). (C) RV dysfunction (green): RV dysfunction was more prevalent in patients reporting high-intensity/long-duration
exercise than in low-intensity/long-duration (83% vs. 40%, p < 0.001) and low-intensity/short-duration exercise (83% vs. 56%, p ¼ 0.001).
(D) RV dilatation (orange): RV dilatation was more prevalent in patients with high-intensity/long-duration exercise than in high-intensity/
short-duration exercise (91% vs. 70%, p ¼ 0.01) and low-intensity/short-duration exercise (91% vs. 61%; p < 0.001). METs ¼ metabolic

 potential confounders, long-duration exercise was
not a marker of VA. In the adjusted model, there was
only a trend towards an association between long-
duration exercise and RV dilation. Increased RV
dimensions are acknowledged effects of endurance
training in healthy athletes (24) but are also associated
with disease progression in AC (25). Therefore, RV
dilation was considered a soft secondary outcome.
This was further supported by the finding that the
exercise
duration
thresholds
associated
with
VA
and RV dilation were shorter than for RV and LV
dysfunction. This is well in line with the progressive
nature of AC, in which VA and RV dilation are
early phenomena that could be followed by later
development of myocardial dysfunction (26).
EXERCISE
INTENSITY. High-intensity exercise was
strongly associated with adverse outcome. AC pa-
tients reporting high-intensity exercise had aggra-
vated phenotypes according to echocardiography and
CMR, indicative of more severe disease. Combining
high-intensity with long-duration exercise was the
strongest marker of VA, which implies that high-
intensity exercise performed for long durations was
the most harmful form of exercise. The majority of
patients reporting high-intensity exercise also re-
ported long-duration exercise. High-intensity exer-
cise remained a strong and independent marker of VA
when adjusted for long-duration exercise and other
potential confounders. Interestingly, high-intensity
exercise of short duration was a strong and inde-
pendent marker of adverse outcome, whereas low-
intensity exercise of long duration was not.
The
more
harmful
effects
of
high
intensity
compared with long duration could have several
possible explanations. During high-intensity exer-
cise, the increase in RV wall stress exceeds LV wall
stress because of the thinner wall of the RV (27). This
incremental increase in wall stress has been proposed
as an explanation of the harmful effects of vigorous
exercise and the RV predilection observed in AC
(7,28). The wall stress increase is less pronounced
during low-intensity exercise, which might therefore
be tolerated, even for longer durations. Our results
are in line with previous reports of harmful effects of
exercise in AC (6,28,29) and add important informa-
tion by highlighting the role of exercise intensity in
AC. Therefore, the advice to AC patients to abstain
from competitive sport should be more specific. The
threshold for harmful exercise intensity in our study
was around 6 to 7 METs for all adverse outcomes,
which suggests that AC patients should not perform
activities such as soccer, aerobics, or fast swimming
on a regular basis, even noncompetitively.
Although VA occurred rarely in mutation-positive
family members, it occurred exclusively in family
members
reporting
high-intensity
exercise.
This
finding adds to previous studies reporting more
prevalent VA in an AC mutation–positive family with
high exercise doses (7,29) and indicates that high-
intensity exercise has also an impact on disease pro-
gression in family members with no or mild disease
manifestation (7).
Low-intensity
exercise,
reflecting
an
active
everyday lifestyle (e.g., walking, gardening), was
associated
with
myocardial
function
and
RV
di-
mensions within the normal range. Low-intensity
exercise seemed to be tolerated better, even when
performed for long durations. However, one-fifth of
patients reporting low-intensity exercise had experi-
enced VA, which might reflect the high prevalence of
VA in AC independently of exercise (6,28). Data on
the safety of moderate-intensity exercise is sparse in
AC. There were no results in our study that suggested
that low-intensity exercise had an adverse impact in
AC; however, further studies should explore safe ex-
ercise thresholds in AC, preferably in experimental
studies, because randomized exercise training trials
in AC patients are unfeasible for ethical reasons.

 dysfunction, and RV dilation than patients with lower
doses. The threshold of exercise doses ranged from
approximately
13
MET
h/week
for
RV
dilation,
equivalent to the upper American Heart Association–
recommended level for healthy adults of 30 min of
low-intensity exercise 5 days per week (4), to almost
double that dose (25 MET h/week) for LV dysfunction.
We
demonstrated
that
exercise
intensity
had
a
stronger association with outcome in AC patients
than exercise duration, which implies that sheer
multiplication of the two might not give an appro-
priate estimation of the exercise load in these pa-
tients. Interestingly, female patients in our study had
lower exercise doses than male patients, which might
be one of several explanations of the lower disease
penetrance in females.
CLINICAL
IMPLICATIONS. Our study showed that
exercise at >6 METs was associated with VA and a
more severe AC phenotype than low-intensity exer-
cise and underscores the advice that AC patients
should avoid high-intensity exercise. Low-intensity
exercise, even for long durations, was not associ-
ated with an unfavorable outcome and might be an
acceptable alternative for patients diagnosed with AC
who wish to maintain an active lifestyle.
STUDY
LIMITATIONS. The
observational
single-
center study design limited external validity. Exer-
cise duration was self-reported, and intensity was
assigned on the basis of the reported exercise activ-
ity. The categorization of exercise duration by median
was arbitrary but coincidentally reflected the mini-
mum exercise duration recommended for healthy
adults (4). We reported exercise habits during the
immediate 3 years before AC diagnosis and did not
include lifelong exercise data in analyses because
exercise habits can change over time and are subject
to recall bias. At diagnosis, patients were advised to
restrict their exercise (11), and exercise after diagnosis
was not assessed. High-intensity exercise was often
combined with long-duration exercise, but the 2 pa-
rameters were only moderately correlated. The high
odds of an adverse outcome in high-intensity exercise
was independent of the interaction between the two,
which
further
strengthens
the
impact
of
high-
intensity exercise.
CONCLUSIONS
High-intensity exercise and long-duration exercise
were both associated with unfavorable outcome in AC
patients, but high-intensity exercise was a strong
marker of VA independent of exercise duration. Low-
intensity
exercise,
even
for
long
durations,
was
associated with a milder phenotype and can be
advised for patients with AC. Further research should
explore the safety of low-intensity exercise and the
effects
of
exercise
intensity
restriction
on
AC
diagnosis.

PERSPECTIVES
COMPETENCY IN MEDICAL KNOWLEDGE: Patients with
arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy reporting exercise above 6
metabolic equivalents at the time of diagnosis had higher prev-
alence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia and impaired
myocardial function. These patients could be advised to restrict
exercise to lower intensities in order to reduce the odds of
adverse outcome.
TRANSLATIONAL OUTLOOK: The safety of low intensity
exercise for long durations, and the effect of exercise restriction
after arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy diagnosis, should be
explored in further, preferably experimental, studies. Due to
convincing evidence supporting the link between exercise and
outcome in these patients, clinical trials are unfeasible for ethical
reasons.
