Aims
Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is typically provoked by negative stressors such as grief, anger, or fear leading to the popular
term ‘broken heart syndrome’. However, the role of positive emotions triggering TTS remains unclear. The aim of the
present study was to analyse the prevalence and characteristics of patients with TTS following pleasant events, which
are distinct from the stressful or undesirable episodes commonly triggering TTS.
Methods
and results
Takotsubo syndrome patients with preceding pleasant events were compared to those with negative emotional triggers
from the International Takotsubo Registry. Of 1750 TTS patients, we identified a total of 485 with a definite emotional
trigger. Of these, 4.1% (n ¼ 20) presented with pleasant preceding events and 95.9% (n ¼ 465) with unequivocal nega-
tive emotional events associated with TTS. Interestingly, clinical presentation of patients with ‘happy heart syndrome’ was
similar to those with the ‘broken heart syndrome’ including symptoms such as chest pain [89.5% (17/19) vs. 90.2% (412/
457), P ¼ 1.0]. Similarly, electrocardiographic parameters, laboratory findings, and 1-year outcome did not differ. How-
ever, in a post hoc analysis, a disproportionate higher prevalence of midventricular involvement was noted in ‘happy
hearts’ compared with ‘broken hearts’ (35.0 vs. 16.3%, P ¼ 0.030).
Conclusion
Our data illustrate that TTS can be triggered by not only negative but also positive life events. While patient character-
istics were similar between groups, the midventricular TTS type was more prevalent among the ‘happy hearts’ than
among the ‘broken hearts’. Presumably, despite their distinct nature, happy and sad life events may share similar final
common emotional pathways, which can ultimately trigger TTS.

Introduction
Since the first description of takotsubo syndrome (TTS) in 1990,1
evolving evidence suggests that TTS is typically precipitated by epi-
sodes of severe negative stress such as grief, anger, or fear.2,3 These
negative emotional triggers have led to the popular term ‘broken
heart syndrome’.4 It is well known that emotional distress may result
in an overstimulation of the sympathetic nervous system and/or in-
appropriate parasympathetic withdrawal.5 As a consequence, the re-
sulting
cardiovascular
effects
may
lead
to
life-threatening
arrhythmias,6–8 TTS,9 and even sudden cardiac death.10,11 Wittstein
et al. confirmed in a prospective study increased levels of circulating
catecholamines in patients with TTS compared with those with Killip
class III myocardial infarction,12 suggesting that in TTS, stressful events
indeed affect the cardiovascular system via an over-activation of the
sympathetic neurohormonal axis.
On the other hand, the role of positive emotions in TTS is far less
clear.13,14 Positive emotions modulate the autonomic nervous sys-
tem response to a similar degree as do negative emotions, which in
turn alter heart rate, peripheral vascular resistance, and blood pres-
sure.5 However, conflicting results exist on the impact of positive
emotions on cardiovascular disease. In the long-term, positive emo-
tions have been associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular dis-
ease,15 while others have shown that they can also provoke acute
coronary syndrome.16 Of note, positive emotions can result not
only in increased activation of the sympathetic nervous system but
also in increased parasympathetic nervous system activity. Interest-
ingly, the likelihood of experiencing a cardiovascular event on one’s
birthday is 27% higher than on any other day of the year.17
The aim of the present study was to analyse the prevalence and
characteristics of TTS in patients after preceding pleasant rather
than unpleasant events. Furthermore, we intend to raise awareness
and compare this new conceptual entity of ‘happy heart syndrome’
with ‘broken heart syndrome’.
Methods
Study population
The International Takotsubo Registry (InterTAKRegistry, www.takotsubo-
registry.com) was established at the University Hospital Zurich in
2011. Patient recruitment and inclusion criteria have been recently
published.18
In brief, data were collected from the leading hospital Zurich and 25
collaborating centres from 9 different countries (Austria, Finland,
France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Switzerland, UK, and USA) between
2011 and 2014. Takotsubo syndrome was defined according to the
modified Mayo Clinic Diagnostic Criteria.18,19
When eligibility for inclusion was uncertain, cases were reviewed by
the core team at the leading centre to reach a consensus.18
The InterTAKRegistry consists of currently 1750 patients, of which 485
presented with an emotional event leading to a TTS episode. The re-
maining patients had a physical, a combination of an emotional and phys-
ical, or no identifiable trigger.18
Patients with a preceding pleasant emotional event prior to TTS were
classified as ‘happy hearts’, while patients with a preceding negative emo-
tional event were categorized as ‘broken hearts’.
The complete medical records of the cardiovascular history preceding
the episode of TTS were reviewed in detail and documented as well as
the acute index TTS event by standardized forms. Data were collected
on clinical presentation, precipitating factors, cardiovascular risk factors,
electrocardiographic findings, cardiac biomarkers, inflammatory mar-
kers, medications, demographics, angiographic and echocardiographic
parameters, in-hospital complications, acute cardiac care. Furthermore,
follow-up was obtained through telephone interviews, clinical visits or
medical records.
Wall motion pattern was classified as apical ballooning (i.e. typical) or
midventricular, basal, or focal type (all designated as atypical), respect-
ively.18 Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular end-
diastolic pressure (LVEDP) were evaluated if assessed. The registry
adhered to the requirements of the respective local ethics committee
(ClinicalTrials.gov number: NCT01947621).

 Statistical analysis
Continuous data are given as mean + SD, laboratory values are given
as median (interquartile range), and categorical variables are expressed
as numbers and percentages. Differences between groups were tested
using the Pearson x2 test or the Fisher’s exact test for nominal data, or
Mann–Whitney U test for continuous data. A post hoc analysis was per-
formed for comparison between TTS types among ‘happy’ and ‘broken’
hearts. One-year survival analysis was performed using the Kaplan–
Meier method, and the P-value was calculated with the log-rank test.
Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics, version
21.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Statistical significance was defined
as two-sided P , 0.05. Graph was compiled with Prism 6 (GraphPad,
La Jolla, CA, USA).
Results
Patient characteristics
Of 485 patients with an emotional event, 4.1% (n ¼ 20) were iden-
tified to have ‘happy heart syndrome’, while the majority of patients
(95.9%, n ¼ 465) had ‘broken heart syndrome’.
Women were over-represented (P , 0.001) without differences
between both groups [‘happy hearts’ 95.0% (19/20) and ‘broken
hearts’ 94.6% (440/465), P ¼ 1.0]. The mean age of patients was
71.4+11.2 years in ‘happy hearts’ and 65.0+ 12.5 years in ‘broken
hearts’ (P ¼ 0.026). Specific joyful emotional events associated with
the onset of TTS are shown in Table 1, and negative emotional
events are presented in Table 2.
Analysis of the socioeconomic status showed that among ‘happy
heart’ patients 20.0% (3/15) were living alone, while 80.0% (12/15)
had a partner. This was similar to ‘broken heart’ patients in which
29.3% (92/314) lived alone and 70.7% (222/314) were living with
someone (P ¼ 0.67). Of note, the majority of patients was un-
employed or retired at the time of the index episode in both ‘happy
heart syndrome’ [92.3% (12/13)] and ‘broken heart syndrome’ [59.7%
(187/313)] (P ¼ 0.018). Characteristics of ‘happy hearts’ and ‘broken
hearts’ are summarized in Table 3.
Symptoms at presentation
Chief complaints upon admission included chest pain in 89.5% (17/
19) and dyspnoea in 26.3% (5/19) of the documented ‘happy heart’
patients. These findings were similar for ‘broken hearts’ in which
chest pain was present in 90.2% (412/457) (P ¼ 1.0) and dyspnoea
in 44.6% (200/448) (P ¼ 0.12).
There were no significant differences in symptoms onset to hos-
pitalization within the first 24 h between ‘happy hearts’ [100% (20/
20)] and ‘broken hearts’ [84.9% (383/451)] (P ¼ 0.054).
Electrocardiogram
Electrocardiogram on admission showed the following abnormalities
for ‘happy heart syndrome’ vs. ‘broken heart syndrome’: ST-segment ele-
vation was present in 50.0% (10/20) vs. 44.5% (193/434) (P ¼ 0.63),
ST-segment depression occurred in 15.0% (3/20) vs. 5.5% (24/434)
(P ¼ 0.08), T-wave inversion was present in 45.0% (9/20) vs. 40.3%
(175/434) (P ¼ 0.68), and left bundle branch block was observed in
5.0% (1/20) vs. 5.1% (22/434) (P ¼ 1.0).
Most patients [95.0% (19/20) vs. 93.8% (407/434), P ¼ 1.0] were
in sinus rhythm, while 5.0% (1/20) vs. 5.5% (24/434) (P ¼ 1.0) pre-
sented with atrial fibrillation. Atrioventricular block was found in
15.0% (3/20) vs. 3.9% (17/434) (P ¼ 0.052).
Vital signs and haemodynamics
Systolic blood pressure on admission averaged 135.2+ 45.2 mmHg
in ‘happy hearts’ vs. 130.6+ 26.2 mmHg in ‘broken hearts’ (P ¼ 0.47)
and diastolic blood pressure 79.5 + 19.8 mmHg vs. 76.6 +
15.4 mmHg (P ¼ 0.42), while mean heart rate was 86.2 + 17.4
b.p.m. vs. 85.3+19.3 b.p.m. (P ¼ 0.85).
Mean LVEDP was not different between the two groups (22.8+
11.0 mmHg vs. 21.1+7.6 mmHg, P ¼ 0.47). Mean LVEF on admis-
sion averaged 40.2 + 9.4% in ‘happy hearts’ vs. 42.6 + 11.0% in
‘broken hearts’ (P ¼ 0.36) (Table 3).
Laboratory values
Admission and peak laboratory values did not significantly differ
between ‘happy hearts’ and ‘broken hearts’ (Table 3).
Takotsubo type
Patients with a ‘happy heart syndrome’ showed an apical ballooning
pattern in 65.0% (13/20). The midventricular TTS type was noted
in 35.0% (7/20). None of the patients presented with a basal or focal
TTS type. Patients with ‘broken hearts’ had apical ballooning in 79.8%
(371/465) and midventricular TTS in 16.3% (76/465). The basal TTS
type was present in 1.9% (9/465) and the focal type in 1.9% (9/465).
The overall distribution of TTS types between ‘happy hearts’ and
‘broken hearts’ was not significantly different (P ¼ 0.21). In a post hoc
comparison, however, a disproportionate higher prevalence of
midventricular involvement was noted in ‘happy hearts’ compared
with ‘broken hearts’ (35.0 vs. 16.3%, P ¼ 0.030) (Figure 1).

 Medication
Upon presentation, a minority of patients had previously taken car-
diovascular medications on a regular basis. Medication on admission
in the ‘happy heart’ and ‘broken heart’ groups included angiotensin-
converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers
[33.3% (5/15) vs. 38.3% (153/400), P ¼ 0.70], b-blockers [33.3%
(5/15) vs. 34.8% (139/400), P ¼ 0.91], statins [20.0% (3/15) vs.
18.0% (70/388), P ¼ 0.74], and aspirin [33.3% (5/15) vs. 34.8%
(135/388), P ¼ 0.91] (Table 3).
Clinical course and outcomes
Acute cardiac care was similar in both ‘happy heart’ and ‘broken heart’
groups (P ¼ 0.67). In the ‘happy heart’ patient population, 5.0%
(1/20) received intra-aortic balloon pump compared with 1.3%
(6/464) (P ¼ 0.26) in the ‘broken hearts’. There were no statistically
significant differences in mechanical ventilation [10.0% (2/20) vs.
4.1% (19/464), P ¼ 0.21] and catecholamine administration [5.0%
(1/20) vs. 5.0% (23/464), P ¼ 1.0].
Among the in-hospital complications, death occurred in none of
the patients with ‘happy hearts’ while 1.1% (5/465) of patients with
‘broken heart’ died during hospitalization (P ¼ 1.0). Cardiogenic
shock occurred in none of ‘happy hearts’ compared with 3.7%
(17/459) in ‘broken hearts’ (P ¼ 1.0). Ventricular or septal rupture
was identified in none of the groups. Ventricular tachycardia oc-
curred in none of ‘happy hearts’ vs. 2.2% (10/459) among patients

 with ‘broken hearts’ (P ¼ 1.0). Ventricular thrombus was present in
5.0% (1/20) of the ‘happy hearts’ vs. 1.1% (5/459) in ‘broken hearts’
(P ¼ 0.23). New atrial fibrillation occurred in none of the ‘happy
heart’ patients. Patients with ‘broken heart syndrome’ presented
with new atrial fibrillation in 3.7% (17/459) (P ¼ 1.0).
There was no statistical significance for the respective complica-
tions between the two groups of ‘happy hearts’ and ‘broken hearts’.
One-year survival was comparable between ‘happy hearts’ and
‘broken hearts’ (100% vs. 97.6+0.9%, P ¼ 0.52).
Discussion
Here, for the first time, we present a systematic analysis of patients
diagnosed with TTS after joyful or socially desirable events, contrary
to the well-established literature. Our data are derived from the lar-
gest study on TTS worldwide examining a plethora of characteristics
of 1750 TTS cases, based on the most comprehensive available data
thus far in the literature.18 Interestingly, symptoms such as chest
pain and dyspnoea as well as the baseline characteristics and clinical
findings upon admission including cardiovascular risk factors and la-
boratory findings were similar between those with ‘happy heart syn-
drome’ and ‘broken heart syndrome’, respectively, regardless of the
nature of the triggering event.
It is now recognized that TTS predominantly affects postmenopau-
sal women20 and is often triggered by an emotional or a physical stres-
sor.21 Thus far, large numbers of TTS cases have been reported after
adverse emotional events, e.g. the death of a beloved one.21 Conse-
quently, TTS is also widely known as the ‘broken heart syndrome’.22
In our analysis, the distribution of various TTS phenotypes among
patients presenting with ‘broken heart’ was similar to that of Eitel
et al.23 Interestingly, we found a higher prevalence of the midventri-
cular takotsubo type in the ‘happy heart’ group.
Our study characterizes a novel clinical presentation of TTS and
might indeed provide important insights into the brain–heart inter-
action, which most likely contributes to the pathophysiology of TTS.
An early systematic study established a social readjustment rating
scale, which included multiple life events and the subsequent ana-
lysis of health consequences, in particular time of onset of illness.24
Among the precipitating factors to be rated, several desirable
events, including marriage, marital reconciliation with one’s mate,
outstanding personal achievements, vacations, and holidays, were
included. Unfortunately, this early inclusion of positive events, per-
haps motivated by clinical intuition, did not prevent subsequent clin-
ical research from unilaterally focussing on negative events as
triggers for TTS. For the first time in decades, now the findings by
Holmes and Rahe have been eventually confirmed.24 Our analysis
corroborates the link between positive emotional experience and
TTS. This is a novel and substantial paradigm shift from the com-
monly accepted inciting events involved in developing TTS.
It is now generally accepted that one’s emotional state plays a role
in the overall health of the individual. Therefore, our findings may
broaden the whole spectrum of the nature of this multifaceted dis-
ease. However, the exact consequences of psychological states and
their manifestations in various clinical syndromes such as TTS have
not been thoroughly explored. As such, the exact molecular path-
ways and functional anatomy of the central nervous system involved
in emotional processing, which are likely to be responsible for their
systemic effects, remain poorly understood.
Similarly, our knowledge regarding the involvement of the central
nervous system in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease
remains insufficient. However, ample epidemiological studies have
demonstrated that the central nervous system indeed plays a prom-
inent role in cardiovascular disease. Earlier imaging studies have re-
vealed activation of specific cortical and subcortical areas of the
brain associated with distinct emotional processing25–27 such as ex-
tended activation in both temporal lobes during certain emotions
including happiness, sadness, and fear, but not during disgust or
anger.28 Subcortical structures including the amygdala, hippo-
campus, and basal ganglia have also been implicated in emotional
processing. The amygdala is not only associated with negative emo-
tions but has been recently also implicated in the processing of
pleasant emotions such as happiness.
Given that the prevalence of the ‘happy heart syndrome’ is only
1.1% among all TTS cases, ‘happy’ events may necessitate more po-
tent stimuli to induce a substantial emotional response than negative
emotions. Perhaps the threshold to influence the cardiovascular sys-
tem is higher when happy events are processed. Alternatively, this
might be simply explained by the propensity of certain individuals
to emotional events. At this point, given the lack of data, we cannot
speculate if individuals with preceding happy events developing TTS
would have suffered similar consequence with preceding negative
emotions. Therefore, it is plausible that the individual’s brain bio-
chemistry, processing, and response to emotions are distinct and
can explain this observed phenomenon.
Limitations
Patients with ‘happy heart syndrome’ had a higher prevalence of the
midventricular TTS type than those with ‘broken heart syndrome’. Al-
though this observation is interesting and novel, it is hypothesis gen-
erating and based on a small subset of patients, which poses a
limitation in explaining the precise mechanism involved. Therefore,
Figure 1 Overall distribution of takotsubo types in ‘happy heart
syndrome’ vs. ‘broken heart syndrome’ (P ¼ 0.21). Post hoc P-values
for comparison within takotsubo types showed a significantly high-
er prevalence of the midventricular takotsubo syndrome type in
patients with ‘happy heart’ vs. ‘broken heart’ (P ¼ 0.030), while no
significant differences were seen in apical (P ¼ 0.15), basal
(P ¼ 1.0), or focal (P ¼ 1.0) takotsubo syndrome types.

 these findings merit further large-scale investigations, particularly in
patients with TTS and preceding pleasant emotional triggers.
Since the study is of observational nature, some values were miss-
ing despite extensive chart review. The small number of ‘happy
hearts’ may have resulted in statistical non-significance of clinically
relevant findings. Nonetheless, retrospective data analysis is particu-
larly valuable in understudied diseases, such as TTS with a low inci-
dence where the pathophysiology continues to remain elusive.
Conclusion
This novel observation of pleasant emotional stressors in triggering
TTS may lead to a paradigm shift in clinical practice by raising aware-
ness among physicians. While the role of negative life events such as
anger, grief, or physical stressors in provoking TTS is acknowledged,
the association between positive emotions and TTS is not common-
ly recognized. Therefore, our findings further expose the multifacet-
ed nature of this disease and broaden the spectrum of triggers
associated with this fascinating disease.
Furthermore, we believe that TTS is a classic example of a com-
plex intertwined feedback loop encompassing psychological and/or
physical stimuli within the brain that subsequently impact the cardio-
vascular system. Perhaps, both happy and sad life events, while in-
herently distinct in nature, share a final common pathway in the
central nervous system processing and output, which can ultimately
trigger TTS. Clearly, future research is warranted to investigate
this possibility and delineate the exact mechanisms underlying
both ‘broken’ and ‘happy’ heart variants of TTS.
