Whose guns are stolen? The epidemiology
of Gun theft victims
David Hemenway1*, Deborah Azrael1 and Matthew Miller2
Abstract
Background: Gun theft is an important source of guns used by criminals. Yet no empirical work has focused on
the characteristics of gun owners that distinguish those who have had their guns stolen from those who have not.
In this study, we examine the demographics and behavioral characteristics of gun owners who report having had a
gun stolen.
Methods: Data come from a nationally representative probability-based online survey conducted in April 2015, with a
linked follow-up survey in November 2015 that asked gun owners about any theft of their guns in the past 5 years.
Results: Of 1,604 gun-owning respondents, 2.4% (95% CI 1.6,3.6) reported that one or more guns had been stolen,
with a mean number of guns stolen per theft of 1.5 (95% CI 1.0,2.0]. Risk factors for having a gun stolen were owning 6
or more guns, owning guns for protection, carrying a gun in the past month, storing guns unsafely, and living in the
South region of the United States. The South accounts for 37% of US households, 43% of gun owners, and two-thirds
of all gun thefts.
Conclusions: We estimate that there are approximately 250,000 gun theft incidents per year, with about 380,000 guns
stolen. We find that certain types of gun owners-who own many guns, who carry guns, and who do not store guns
safely-are at higher risk to have their guns stolen. Tracing data show that states in the South are exporters of crime
guns used in other states. Our survey results find that the majority of guns stolen in the US come from the South.

Background
Virtually every gun in the United States begins as a legal
gun, manufactured legally and initially sold by a federally
licensed gun dealer to an individual who passes a federal
background check. However, many people with known
anger, violence and/or alcohol problems can pass a federal
background check (Swanson et al. 2015) and many people
who cannot pass a background check still have easy access
to firearms. The movement of guns to individuals who
cannot pass a background check occurs via various mech-
anisms, including straw purchases, gifts, sales without a
background check (Miller et al. 2017), and gun thefts.
Estimates over the past two decades suggest that
200,000 to 500,000 guns are stolen each year in the
United States. Such estimates have come from several
sources, including the National Crime Victimization
Surveys (Langton 2012), police reports of stolen guns
(DoJ 2012) and surveys of gun owners (Cook and Lud-
wig 1996).
The large number of guns stolen each year suggests
that theft may be an important source of “crime guns.”
Indeed, it appears that while gun theft is often not the
proximate source of firearms for most criminals (Cook
et al. 2015a; Chesnut et al. 2016), it is often the ultimate
source-the way guns initially enter into the illegal market
(Sheley and Wright 1993).
It is generally accepted that theft is an important
source of guns for youth and criminals (Cook et al.
1995) and some research has examined how youth and
offenders acquire their guns (Wright and Rossi 1986;
Webster et al. 2002; Cook et al. 2015b). Yet as far as we
can tell, there has not been a journal article in the peer-
reviewed literature on the epidemiology of gun theft.
And no study has identified characteristics of gun

 owners that distinguish those who have had guns stolen
from those who have not.
What is currently known about the epidemiology of
gun theft comes from Bureau of Justice Statistics reports
summarizing
results
from
the
National
Crime
Victimization Surveys (NCVS) (Langton 2012; Zawitz
1995) NCVS data provide estimates of gun theft along
with respondent demographic characteristics including
household composition and US census region. An ad-
vantage of our survey over the NCVS is that we obtain
much gun-related information about the respondent,
such as how many guns are owned and whether the re-
spondent carries a gun. Our survey allows us to compare
gun owners whose guns were stolen with owners who
did not experience a gun theft.
In this article, we use 2015 data from a large national
survey of gun owners to describe gun theft victims-
examining the characteristics of the gun owners whose
guns have been stolen. In the jargon of epidemiology, we
are describing some “risk factors” for being the type of
person whose guns are stolen. We are not describing
risk factors for being a gun thief.
Methods
Data come from a nationally representative web-based
survey conducted in April 2015, and a linked supple-
mental web-based survey, conducted in November 2015,
of gun owners who responded to the initial survey. The
authors designed the surveys, which were conducted by
the survey firm Growth for Knowledge (GfK). The initial
survey focused broadly on firearm ownership and use.
Respondents (n = 3949) were drawn from GfK’s Knowl-
edgePanel, an on-line panel of approximately 55,000 U.S.
adults. The panel is selected on an ongoing basis to pro-
vide samples that are representative of the US popula-
tion. Details of GfK’s survey design are described
elsewhere (Miller et al. 2017; Betz et al. 2016; Knowledge
Networks 2012; Azrael et al. 2015).
For the primary survey, 7,318 panel members received
an invitation to participate. Of these, 3,949 completed
the survey, yielding a survey completion rate of 55%
(Callegaro and DiSogra 2008). Compared with survey
non-respondents, respondents were more likely to be fe-
male, younger, less educated, unmarried and live in
metropolitan areas.
Gun owners were identified through two questions:
“Do you or does anyone else you live with currently own
any type of guns?” followed by, among all respondents
who answered in the affirmative: “Do you personally
own a gun?”
In November 2015, GfK conducted a follow-up survey
of the gun owners in the original survey (n = 2072 who
were still in the GfK panel (n = 1880). Two questions
were asked about gun theft: whether any of respondents’
guns were stolen in the past 5 years and how many were
stolen.
Invitations to participate in the supplemental survey
were sent by e-mail, and one reminder email was sent to
non-respondents 3 days later. Participants did not re-
ceive any specific incentive to complete the survey, al-
though GfK has a modest point-based incentive program
through which participants accrue points for completing
surveys and can later redeem them for cash, merchan-
dise, or participation in sweepstakes.
Of those eligible for the supplemental survey (n =
1880), 1613 took the survey and 1604 answered the theft
question (85%). Data for the outcome variable (i.e., hav-
ing a gun stolen) come from this supplemental survey;
all other data come from the individual responses to the
original survey. The supplemental survey respondents
did not differ from the gun-owning respondents in the
primary survey with respect to age, gender, race, or type
of gun most recently acquired.
To ensure reliable estimates about gun owners at the
national level, the primary survey oversampled gun
owners using GfK demographic profile variables. GfK
provided survey weights for the current study that com-
bined presample weights with study-specific poststratifi-
cation weights to account for oversampling, and for
survey nonresponse to both the April 2015 and Novem-
ber 2015 surveys.
The outcome variable is whether the gun owner had
one or more guns stolen in the past 5 years. Explanatory
variables include six demographic and five gun-related
variables: (1) age (<30; 31–44; 45–59; 60+); (2) gender;
(3) race/ethnicity (white non-hispanic or other); (4)
household income (<$75,000 or $75,000+); (5) urbanicity
(“Which best describes the community that you cur-
rently live in?”-rural, suburban, urban); (6) census region
(Northeast, Midwest, South, West); (7) number of guns
owned (<6 or 6+); (8) whether protection against people
was one of the reasons for owning guns (9) carry guns
(“In the past 30 days, have you carried a loaded handgun
on your person” or not); (10) whether any guns were
stored “in my car or other motor vehicle”; and (11) safe
gun storage (worst = any gun loaded and unlocked; inter-
mediate = at least one gun either loaded or unlocked;
best = all guns unloaded and locked).
We conducted all analyses using Stata IC 14 (Stata-
Corp), with use of appropriate weighting commands
(using the weight variable provide by GfK) to generate
national estimates and following the STROBE (Strength-
ening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epi-
demiology) guidelines for reporting (von Elm et al.
2007). We use weighted percentages and calculate un-
adjusted odds ratios using logistic regression.

Results
Among gun owners, 2.4% report having one or more
guns stolen in the past 5 years (Table 1). The mean
number of guns stolen per incident was 1.5(95% CI:
1.0,2.0). Using data from the April 2015 survey, we esti-
mated that 22% of US adults are gun owners (Azrael
et al. 2015), consistent with findings from the General
Social Surveys from the University of Chicago’s National
Opinion Research Center (Smith and Son 2015). Using
these results, and given approximately 242 million adults
lived in the US (average for 2011–2015), we estimate
that there were 1.2 million incidents of gun theft over a
5-year period, or about 250,000 incidents per year. With
1.5 guns stolen per incident, we estimate that approxi-
mately 380,000 guns (95% CI 260,000,510,000) were
stolen per year.
A significantly higher percentage of non-white gun
owners had guns stolen (5.2 vs. 1.8%). Gun owners were
also more likely to have guns stolen if they had six or
more guns (4.5 vs. 1.7%), owned guns for protection (3.1
vs. 1.0%), carried guns in the past month (5.3 vs. 1.7%),
did not store their guns in the safest manner (2.9 vs
1.0%) and, non-significantly, stored guns in the car (5.7
vs. 2.2%). A significantly higher percentage of gun
owners from the South region had guns stolen (3.7 vs.
1.4%). Our survey indicates that 43% of gun owners res-
ide in the South (694/1611) and 2/3 of gun thefts occur
in the South.
Discussion
Reporters are taught to investigate the who, what, how,
when and why of an issue. This article focuses on one
half of the who question-whose guns were stolen, but
not who stole the guns. We believe ours is the first jour-
nal article whose primary focus is on any aspect of fire-
arm theft.
Gun theft appears to be an important method by
which guns enter the illegal market. Our estimate of
250,000 gun-theft incidents per year lies between older
(1987–1992) and more recent estimates from the Na-
tional
Crime Victimization
Surveys
(Langton
2012;
Zawitz 1995). Our finding that the mean number of
guns stolen per incident is 1.5 is also consistent with
NCVS findings (Langton 2012). We thus estimate that
the total number of guns stolen annually is about
380,000, which is also generally consistent with previ-
ous findings (Langton 2012; Cook and Ludwig 1996;
Zawitz 1995).

 We find that white gun owners are substantially less
likely to have guns stolen than non-white gun owners
(the latter are a very heterogeneous group). National
data show that whites are substantially less likely to be
victims of both burglary and robbery than non-whites
(US Department of Justice. Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Crime Victims in the United States 2008). Although
white gun owners have significantly lower rates of gun
theft than non-white owners, since the large majority of
gun owners are white (80%), most gun thefts (60%) in-
volve white victims.
Our study is the first to explore the association be-
tween
gun-related
characteristics
and
gun
theft
victimization. We find that owning many guns, owning
guns for protection, carrying guns, and storing guns un-
safely are associated with having guns stolen. Storing
guns in the car also appears to increase the risk; evi-
dence suggests that many firearms are stolen from cars
(Stolzenberg and D’Allessio 2000; Everytown for Gun
Safety 2016; Freskos 2016). Owning many guns appears
to be a risk factor for gun theft, perhaps because bur-
glars see firearms as loot, so more household guns may
make a more attractive target (Cook and Ludwig 2003).
Carrying guns may increase the potential exposure to
gun theft, and storing guns unlocked should make it eas-
ier for a thief to steal the gun.
We find that the majority of incidents of guns stolen
in the United States come from one region-the South, a
finding that is consistent with data from the NCVS
(Langton 2012). Of the four main US regions, the South,
accounts for 37% of households, 44% of the property
crime (Federal Bureau of Investigation. Uniform Crime
Reports 2014) but 2/3 of the gun theft incidents. The
Southern region has the highest percentage of house-
holds with firearms and the least safe storage practices
(Okoro et al. 2005). Not surprisingly, most Southern
states are “exporters” of guns traced in crime (Mayors
Against Illegal Guns 2010).
By contrast, our data show that the Northeast has
lower rates of gun theft per gun owner, and lower levels
of gun ownership, than the other three regions. States in
the Northeast, particularly those with low levels of gun
ownership and strong gun laws (e.g., Massachusetts,
New York, Rhode Island, Connecticut) are “importers”
of crime guns (Mayors Against Illegal Guns 2010).
This study has various limitations. First it relies exclu-
sively on self-reports. Fortunately, our results concerning
gun ownership, gun theft and other gun issues are
largely consistent with those of other surveys (Azrael
et al. 2015). Second, even though we obtain data from
over 1600 gun owners, only 2.4% reported a gun theft in
the previous 5 years, resulting in limited statistical
power. Third we know almost nothing about the actual
event–the type of gun stolen, where the gun was stored
(e.g., at home, in the garage), whether it was locked up,
the time of day or day of the week of the theft, who the
thief was and whether he was known to the victim. The
information we have about gun owners deals with re-
sponses at the time of the survey, not at the time of the
theft or the exposure. For example, we do not know if
respondents moved, or changed their firearms behaviors.
Finally, we have no estimate of the number of guns
stolen from juveniles, from individuals who were not
gun owners at the time of the survey, or from gun man-
ufacturers, wholesalers or licensed retailers (over 6 thou-
sand guns were reported stolen from licensed dealers in
2015, and another 8 thousand lost) (Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. (ATF) 2016). Indeed,
we do not know whether or not any of the respondents
in our survey are gun dealers (though the question on
gun theft referred to their personal firearms).
Hundreds of thousands of guns are stolen each year;
gun theft is an important way that guns enter the illegal
market. There are many ways gun theft could be re-
duced. Personalized guns would limit the utility of fire-
arms to unauthorized users and reduce the incentive to
steal guns. In addition, if gun owners stored their guns
more safely, probably fewer guns would be stolen.
Changes in how owners store their guns could occur
from changes in laws and in social norms concerning
gun storage (Everytown for Gun Safety 2016). Physi-
cians, gun shops, gun trainers and others could help
change norms concerning storage practices. Gun theft
could also be curtailed by improvements in gun storage
technology that reduce the price while making it quicker
for the authorized user, and harder for the thief, to gain
access to the firearm. Law enforcement could help by in-
creasing the likelihood of investigating and prosecuting
gun theft and by disrupting the stolen gun market.
Unfortunately, there has been limited funding for fire-
arms research resulting in insufficient firearm research
compared to the size of the public health problem (Stark
and Shah 2017), and relatively little is known about gun
theft. For example, we could not find any journal articles
on the relationship between gun storage and gun theft in
the United States. Our survey had only a few questions
about gun theft; it would be informative to have a large
survey with a major focus on gun theft in order to pro-
vide information about the what, where, why and how of
the event. Gun theft is an important issue that deserves
more academic attention.
Conclusions
A common way guns get into criminal hands appears to
be through gun theft. Yet little is known about gun theft
in the United States; ours appears to be the first journal
article focusing on gun theft. We estimate that approxi-
mately 380,000 guns are stolen each year, in about
Hemenway et al. Injury Epidemiology  (2017) 4:11 
Page 4 of 5
 250,000 incidents. Gun owners who own more guns,
own them for protection, carry guns, store gun unsafely,
and in cars, are more likely to have guns stolen. Al-
though the Southern region is home to 37% of US
households, approximately two-thirds of guns stolen are
from the South. Attempts to reduce the number of
stolen guns may do well to focus on individuals and
places where most gun theft occurs.
