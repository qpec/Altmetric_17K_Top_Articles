ABSTRACT 
The results of clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of HER2 inhibitors in patients 
with breast cancer indicate that the correlation between HER2 receptor levels and 
patient outcomes is as low as 50%. The relatively weak correlation between HER2 
status and response to HER2-targeting drugs suggests that measurement of HER2 
signaling activity, rather than absolute HER2 levels, may more accurately diagnose 
HER2-driven breast cancer. A new diagnostic test, the CELx HER2 Signaling Profile 
(CELx HSP) test, is demonstrated to measure real-time HER2 signaling function in live 
primary cells. In the present study, epithelial cells extracted fresh from breast cancer 
patient tumors classified as HER2 negative (HER2–, n = 34 of which 33 were estrogen 
receptor positive) and healthy subjects (n = 16) were evaluated along with reference 
breast cancer cell lines (n = 19). Live cell response to specific HER2 agonists (NRG1b 
and EGF) and antagonist (pertuzumab) was measured. Of the HER2– breast tumor cell 
samples tested, 7 of 34 patients (20.5%; 95% CI = 10%–37%) had HER2 signaling 
activity that was characterized as abnormally high.  Amongst the tumor samples 
there was no correlation between HER2 protein status (by cell cytometry) and HER2 
signaling activity (hyperactive or normal) (Regression analysis P = 0.144, R2 = 0.068). 
One conclusion is that measurement of HER2 signaling activity can identify a subset 
of breast cancers with normal HER2 receptor levels with abnormally high levels of 
HER2 signaling. This result constitutes a new subtype of breast cancer that should 
be considered for treatment with HER2 pathway inhibitors. 
INTRODUCTION
Breast cancer classification is largely based upon a 
patient’s expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).
HER2 is normally expressed on all breast epithelial 
cells, but HER2 gene (ERBB2) amplification and/or HER2 
protein overexpression is detected in approximately 
 
15%–20% of breast cancers and associated with more 
aggressive disease progression, metastasis, and a poorer 
prognosis [1–4 ]. HER2 clinical status is most commonly 
determined using immunohistochemistry (IHC) to 
assess HER2 protein expression or fluorescent in situ 
hybridization (FISH) to assess ERBB2 amplification. 
Agents targeting HER2, such as trastuzumab, 
lapatinib, and pertuzumab, significantly improve clinical 
outcomes in HER2+ patients [4, 5]. Currently, a patient’s 
eligibility for HER2-targeted therapies is determined

by their IHC- or FISH-based HER2 testing scores [4]. 
However, results from recent studies and trials have cast 
doubt on the conventional opinion that only patients with 
HER2+ tumors benefit from HER2 targeted therapies. 
Paik and colleagues reported that in the NSABP B-31 
trial, 174 of 1787 patients (9.7%) originally classified 
as HER2+ were actually HER2– when their HER2 status 
was reanalyzed in a central laboratory. Surprisingly, 
these HER2– patients benefited as much from adjuvant 
trastuzumab as the HER2+ patients. The authors concluded 
that there was no significant correlation between ERBB2 
copy number and trastuzumab benefit [6]. These intriguing 
results have led to the ongoing NSABP B-47 trial, 
which is testing the addition of trastuzumab to standard 
chemotherapy in HER2– tumors. 
The molecular mechanisms underlying the clinical 
benefit of HER2 targeted therapy in the adjuvant setting 
in HER2–  patients whose tumors do not display classical 
HER2 overexpression or amplification remain unclear. 
One emerging hypothesis is that aberrant HER2 signaling, 
rather than increased HER2 expression, may account for 
the clinical benefit of HER2 targeted therapy in some 
HER2– breast cancers.  It has been well established that 
in breast tumors, the catalytically inactive HER family 
member HER3 is an obligate partner for HER2 and 
couples active HER2 to the PI3K/AKT pathway to drive 
tumor cell growth and survival [7–9]. Recent data also 
suggests that expression of NRG1b, a cognate ligand for 
HER3 and HER4, is associated with HER2 activation in 
HER2– tumors [10]. These findings suggest that increased 
HER2 expression may not be an absolute requirement for 
increased HER2 signaling activity. 
Current HER2 tests using either IHC or FISH do 
not provide a functional status of HER2 or its signaling 
network, which may significantly lessen these tests’ 
effectiveness in patient selection for HER2 signaling 
inhibitors, particularly for HER2– patients. Thus, tests 
to identify HER2– patients who may benefit from HER2 
targeted therapies represents an unmet medical need. 
Biosensor-based methods have provided data 
for real-time live cell assessment of signaling activities 
and responses to drugs in cancer cell lines [11–13]. The 
aim of the present study was to provide early evidence 
that a biosensor test had the necessary sensitivity and 
reproducibility for clinical utility and that this test could 
provide proof-of-concept that some breast cancers 
classified as HER2– by IHC may exhibit abnormally 
elevated HER2 activity.  The present study uses an 
impedance biosensor in a 96-well microplate format 
monitoring cell adhesion properties to  quantify HER2 
signaling activity in the CELx HER2 Signaling Profile 
test (CELx HSP) [11].  To measure the signaling driven 
specifically by HER2 participation, EGF and NRG1b 
initiated signaling is measured with and without the 
presence of pertuzumab. The monoclonal antibody, 
pertuzumab, has been demonstrated to bind to HER2 and 
prevent HER2 dimerization essential for its participation 
in ligand driven signaling.  The result reported from the 
CELx HSP test thus represents the amount of ligand 
driven HER2 signaling activity directly associated with 
HER2 heterodimerization with HER3 and HER1. 
The findings presented here suggest that a subset of 
HER2– breast cancer patients whose cells display abnormal 
HER2 signaling activity as measured by the CELx HSP 
test may be candidates for HER2 signaling inhibitors. 
RESULTS
Growth of epithelial cells derived from patient 
tissue specimens
Tissue specimens were digested and placed into 
serum-free mammary epithelial media. Cells and cell 
clusters attached to the 6-well plate surface within 
24 hours and colonies became visible within four to six 
days of culture. The majority of the colonies appeared 
phenotypically epithelial, marked by a tight cobblestone 
appearance (Figure 1A). Fibroblasts were occasionally 
present in very low numbers but their presence became 
less evident after a few days as the epithelial cell number 
expanded.  Figure 1B shows flow cytometry results for 
four typical primary samples with > 95% heterogeneous 
epithelial (luminal, myo-, and stem/progenitor) and less 
than 1% fibroblasts. Figure 1A shows representative 
cultures from a digested tumor specimen at day 1 and day 
5 of culture, respectively. Cells were monitored for growth 
and harvested when they approached ~50% confluence 
(~2 × 105 to 3 × 105 cells). A fraction of harvested cells 
was used for flow cytometric analysis. Of the 34 tumor 
specimens analyzed here, 33 were reported as Luminal A 
or B [14, 15] and one was triple negative (ER–/PR–/HER2–) 
 
(Table 1). 
Next, the harvested cells were characterized using 
a set of biomarkers that define mammary epithelial 
subsets [16]. When used in combination, these markers 
identified four cell populations found in the normal human 
mammary gland, including EPCAM+CD49f– epithelial 
cells, EPCAM+CD49f+ luminal progenitor cells, EPCAM–
CD49f+ basal/myoepithelial cells, and EPCAM–CD49f– 
stromal cells. Figure 1B shows a flow cytometric analysis 
of four representative tumors at the time of CELx HSP 
test, indicating populations containing both luminal-like 
and basal-like characteristics. Figure 1C shows a plot 
of all the tumors (n = 34) with respect to CD49f (basal 
marker) and EPCAM (luminal marker) indicating that the 
method used to grow the epithelial cells allowed for the 
growth of a diverse set of tumor cells. As the majority of 
tumor samples were from ER+/PR+ patients, ER and PR 
were expected to be expressed in the primary cells grown 
from these tumors, as shown in Figure 1D.

Patient tissue-derived primary cells did not 
overexpress HER2
Protein expression of HER receptors in samples 
derived from cancer (n = 34) and healthy (n = 16) subjects 
were assessed by flow cytometry; all primary mammary 
epithelial cells evaluated in this study expressed normal 
amounts of HER2 (Figure 1D). Figure 1E is a histogram 
plot of HER2 expression measured by flow cytometry 
of a representative tumor compared to the HER2+ breast 
cancer cell line SKBR3 (DAKO test score 3+) and the 
HER2– breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 (DAKO test 
score 0). The bar below the histogram plot represents the 
range of means from all the primary tumors and healthy 
tissue tested. As in Figure 1D and 1E, all 34 tumor and 16 
healthy samples had normal/low HER2 expression levels 
in the range of HER2– cell lines. This confirms the clinical 
test results reported to us for each specimen by a clinical 
pathologist using standard IHC clinical protocols, that the 
34 tumor samples were true HER2–.  HER1 and HER3 
were also present at various levels on all the cells tested, 
demonstrating that these proteins were expressed in each 
cell sample and available for hetero-dimerization with 
HER2 (Table 1).

The CELx HSP test for patient-derived primary 
cells
The CELx HSP test measures HER2-related 
signaling in live breast cancer cells in real-time by 
evaluating the difference between agonist (ligand/growth 
factor)-induced signals in the absence or presence of a 
HER2 dimerization antagonist over a 4-hour duration [11]. 
The current study first aimed to demonstrate that the CELx 
HSP test could meet the analytical signal sensitivity and 
pathway specificity expectations for a clinical diagnostic 
using patient-derived primary cells.  
The seeding density for primary cells on the sensor 
plates was first studied to optimize the cell number that 
would result in a robust ligand-induced CELx HSP signal. 
Results indicated that 1.5 × 104 cells per well gave a 
consistent ligand-induced signal across many different cell 
samples and showed the largest proportional increase in 
the CELx HSP time-course signal. Representative results 
of NRG1b-induced CELx HSP time-course signal using 
primary cells from one study subject (R37) are shown in 
Figure 2A. 
HER2 hetero-dimerizes with HER1, HER3, 
and HER4, to activate ligand dependent signaling in 
conjunction with these HER family members. Thus the 
ligands NRG1b (binds HER3 and HER4), EGF (binds 
HER1), and a HER2 receptor dimerization blocker 
(pertuzumab) were employed to demonstrate that the 
CELx HSP signals are attributable to HER2 signaling 
through HER1 and HER3. The EC50 dose for each 
stimulus, NRG1b and EGF, was first determined. It 
was demonstrated that the magnitude of the CELx HSP 
signals correlated with the dose of each ligand (NRG1b 
and EGF) and that the curve fit values obtained were in 
close agreement with literature [17]. Examples of dose-
response curves of NRG1b and EGF in a representative 
primary cell sample (R39) are shown in Figure 2B and 2C, 
respectively. 
Tests were then performed to assess whether 
the ligand-driven CELx HSP HER2 signals could be 
inhibited by pertuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal 
antibody that specifically blocks HER2 dimerization 
with HER1, HER3, and HER4 and thus allows the 
assessment of the proportions of HER2-dependent 
signals driven by HER2- hetero-dimerizations and HER 
family homo-dimerizations in the quantitation of the 
CELx HSP values [17, 18]. As shown in a representative 
sample in Figure 2D, pertuzumab inhibited NRG1b-
initiated CELx HSP signal with an IC50 of 0.17 ug/
mL. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the 
CELx HSP test can specifically detect ligand-induced 
HER2-related signals and determine whether a HER2-
driven test signal is sensitive or insensitive to a HER2-
targeted drug. A conservative 10 µg/mL (~68 nM) 
pertuzumab concentration that was consistent wth drug 
dose exposure in patients was selected. This concentration 
provided ~100% inhibition on the NRG1b-induced 
CELx HSP signal in test development samples and 
reduced the chance for off-target effects. The pertuzumab 
concentration and inhibition result were in agreement 
with the results of others [17] and 5-fold below the mean 
trough serum concentration reported in pertuzumab’s 
FDA BLA (www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/
nda/2012/125409Orig1s000MedR.pdf). 
CELx HSP test using HER2– primary tumor cells 
After the test demonstrated sensitivity and 
specificity, the test was used with HER2– patient tumor 
cells to determine whether a sub-group of samples had 
abnormal HER2 pathway signaling.  CELx HSP tests 
were performed on 34 tumor cell samples from patients 
with breast cancer classified as HER2– to measure 
HER2 pathway stimulation and signal specificity.  For 
comparative purposes, 16 primary breast epithelial cell 
samples from healthy patients, and DAKO IHC test 
standard breast cancer cell lines SKBr3 and MDA-231 
were also subjected to CELx HSP Tests. 
NRG1b-induced and EGF-induced CELx HSP 
signals for tumor and healthy primary cells and a HER2+ 
reference cell line (SKBr3) are summarized in Table 2. 
CELx HSP curves representing primary tumor samples 
that have high (R39) and low (R58) HER2 signaling 
activities are shown in Figure 3A. Note that the high 
NRG1b responder has more than 10 times greater signal 
than the low responder, indicative the test has a large 
dynamic range.
Box-and-whisker plots of the CELx HSP test scores 
were constructed for the four groups (HER2+ cell lines, 
HER2– cell lines, HER2– patient-derived tumor cells, and 
cells derived from healthy tissue) presented in Figure 3B. 
The plot demonstrates the relative quartile distributions of 
the four groups by CELx HSP test score. Note for the box-
and-whisker plot that the median HER2 activation levels 
are comparable for the tumors clinically classified as 
HER2–, HER2– cell lines, and the healthy patient samples. 
Whereas, the median of the ligand-induced HER2 activity 
in HER2+ cell lines is approximately 2.5-fold greater than 
the median of the other groups.
A cutoff of 250 response units (90% of the upper 
range of the healthy responses and coincidental with the 
median value of the HER2+ cell line population) was 
determined to represent an abnormally active HER2 
signaling network in primary breast cancer cells. Previous 
work using this cutoff criteria demonstrated that only 
 
4 out of 9 (44%) of the HER2+ cell lines are considered 
highly active for HER2 signaling [11]. Only one of the 
healthy patient samples had a CELx HSP test response 
level slightly greater than 250.  
Of the HER2– breast tumor cell samples tested, 
 
7 of 34 patients (20.5%; 95% CI 10.0–37.1) had HER2 
signaling activity that was characterized as abnormally

high. Given that none of these primary tumor and healthy 
cells have elevated HER2 expression levels (Figure 1D 
and 1E), these results indicate that the robust HER2-driven 
signalling observed in the primary tumors is not due to the 
HER2 overexpression. 
CELx HSP test positive patients are not 
identifiable by patient and tumor clinical 
characterizations and HER family fluorescence 
cytometry
All seven (7/34) of the breast cancer specimens that 
were CELx HSP test positive for upregulated HER2-related 
signaling were from patients with invasive/infiltrative 
carcinoma and 1/7 patients were diagnosed with lobular 
carcinoma. CELx HSP test positive patients in this group 
were all grade 2/grade 3 and only one of the patients was 
node positive.  The small number of patients did not allow for 
statistical analysis of correlation of clinical characterizations 
with CELx HSP test results.  The fluorescence cytometry 
data provided no key to determining which samples would 
have CELx HSP Test positive results. The fluorescence 
cytometry results show that HER1 expression in all seven 
CELx HSP test positive samples was below the mean and 
median for this group of 34 tumor samples. HER2 protein 
level in the tumor sample group showed no correlation with 
CELx HSP test positive group result even within the HER2– 
group (P = 0.144, R2 = 0.068). In the seven CELx HSP test 
positive HER2– samples, the HER3 expression levels span 
from low to high range (Table 1).  Retrospective analysis of 
HER2– patient sample data collected in parallel to the CELx 
HSP test results provided no insight as to which patients 
would have hyperactive HER2 signaling. 
DISCUSSION
When patients are inherently resistant to a targeted 
therapy, the specific disease mechanism the targeted 
therapy is designed to inhibit may not be present despite 
the presence of the target, the drug, and a correlative 
genomic biomarker. This highlights the importance of 
developing tools that provide more precise diagnosis of a 
patient’s disease mechanism than is possible with current 
biomarker-based tests.

Accurate determination of HER2 status is critical 
for optimizing employment of HER2 targeted therapies 
and improving clinical outcomes in patients with HER2-
driven breast cancer. However, IHC and FISH tests 
do not provide a quantitative measurement of HER2 
function (e.g., the status of the HER2 signaling network), 
which is perhaps the most crucial aspect underlying the 
pathophysiology of HER2-driven diseases. 
In the present study, the potential use of the CELx 
HSP test was investigated to quantitatively assess the 
dynamic status of the HER2 signaling network in patient-
derived live primary breast tumor cells from patients 
classified as HER2– by traditional IHC and or FISH-based 
clinical pathology tests. 
The present work first established that cultured 
primary cells derived from fresh patient tumor tissue 
were of the right type and would consistently maintain 
a level of phenotypic diversity reminiscent of the tumor 
tissue. The cells derived from these tissues continue to 
express ER (26/34 samples; one sample was ER–/PR–/
HER2–) as measured by intracellular flow cytometry. 
Several biomarkers that define luminal and basal types of 
epithelial cells were also used [16]. The tumors maintained 
multiple phenotypically distinct subsets (see Figure 2A) 
of epithelial cells suggesting a phenotypically diverse set 
of tumors. 
Next, the work demonstrated that HER2+ patients 
were not inadvertently included in the study and that there 
were no HER2+ cells present in the test samples.  Only 
samples reported as HER2 IHC 0 or 1+ in the original 
patient pathology report were used in this study.  The 
HER2 status was independently confirmed by FACS 
and RT-qPCR and found to be 100% concordant with 
the pathology reports.  Figure 1E demonstrates good 
dynamic range and sensitivity of FACS to the presence of 
any HER2+ cells.  The concordance level found between

the IHC testing performed at the treating institution and 
FACS and RT-q-PCR testing for IHC 0 and 1+ tumors 
was consistent with a number of studies evaluating the 
concordance between IHC results and FISH amplification 
status (~99%).  However, concordance between IHC and 
FISH results are lower for IHC 2+ results (~90%–95%) 
and even lower for IHC 3+ results (~85%) suggesting the 
potential need for improved methods of evaluating HER2 
receptor status [19–21]. New HER2 mRNA quantification 
methods are emerging that may offer improved specificity 
or sensitivity than IHC or FISH methods [22].
HER2+ samples were specifically excluded from 
this study.  The current test was developed to detect 
the ligand dependent HER2-driven cancer the authors 
believe is most likely to be found in a normal HER2 
expression level breast cancer patient.  Future work may 
demonstrate the CELx HSP test can possibly be applied 
to HER2+ breast cancer patients to identify patients not 
likely to respond to current anti-HER2 therapies such as 
trastuzumab. Since the effectiveness of trastuzumab is 
reported to involve Antibody Dependent Cell-mediated 
Cytotoxicity (ADCC) killing in HER2+ cells, and the 
present CELx HSP Test does not effectively assess ADCC 
killing, additional development would be required.
The tissue samples used to establish the primary 
cultures were taken directly from a specimen evaluated 
first by a pathologist at the treating institution.  The 
pathology reports for 11 of 34 samples used in this study 
noted some presence of Ductal Carcinoma In Situ (DCIS) 
in addition to breast cancer tissue. There is no well-
established way to distinguish DCIS cells from tumor cells 
outside of a pathological stained tissue cross-section slide. 
For this reason, the authors were not able to independently 
confirm that only tumor cells were included in the cell 
samples tested here.  In the 11 specimens obtained from 
patients reported to have DCIS in addition to breast 
cancer, nearly every section described in the pathology 
reports was described as having > 90% ER+/PR+ nuclear 
positivity, suggesting the vast majority of the specimen 
evaluated was cancer tissue.  Two of the 11 samples 
obtained from patients with DCIS were HSP+, the same 
proportion of HSP+ samples not reporting DCIS +.  While 
not definitive evidence of the lack of DCIS cells or the lack 
of potential bias from the presence of DCIS cells in our 
test samples, the equal proportion of HSP+ patients in the 
patients with DCIS and without DCIS is suggestive that no 
bias exists in our sample set due to potential presence of 
DCIS cells.  In the event that DCIS cells were included in 
the test sample, it has been suggested that abnormal HER2 
in DCIS is indicative of patients more likely to progress to 
invasive carcinoma [23].
After the sample type was confirmed, a complete 
CELx HSP test was performed on 34 breast cancer 
samples originally classified by a clinical pathologist 
as HER2– and 16 healthy control samples. The test 
identified a subset (7 of 34, 20.5%) of HER2– primary 
tumor cell samples that had abnormally elevated HER2 
signals above the median level of HER2+ cell lines. The 
CELx HSP test positive patients could not be identified 
by fluorescence flow cytometry analysis of any HER 
family markers.  Several previous studies describe the 
potential to use HER3 expression levels to predict breast 
cancer prognosis [24–27].  Importantly, Bae et al. in 
a study of 950 cases with long term follow-up data did 
not find HER3 expression levels correlated to prognosis 
in hormone receptor positive breast cancer.  The present 
study, which studied predominantly hormone receptor 
positive breast cancer tumors (26 of 35 tumors), supports 
this conclusion.   Statistical analysis of our CELx HSP test 
results demonstrates that there is no correlation between 
HER2 receptor expression level and HER2 signaling. 
Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence 
that hyper-activation of HER2 signaling occurs primarily 
through NRG1b stimulation in HER2– samples and that 
these patients may benefit from HER2 signaling inhibitors. 
The results of the recent NSABP B-31 trial 
comparing the safety and efficacy of doxorubicin and 
cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel (AC-T) to that 
of AC-T plus trastuzumab suggested that some patients 
with HER2– cancer benefited as much from HER2-
targeted adjuvant trastuzumab as patients with HER2+ [6]. 
It has been speculated that patients with HER2– cancer 
could have circulating tumor cells that are HER2+, or that 
trastuzumab may have off-target effects on other RTKs 
or other pathways connecting to PI3K/AKT. Although 
these mechanisms remain to be explored, the findings of 
abnormally high HER2 signaling activities in a subset of 
HER2– tumors offer an alternative explanation for why 
some patients with HER2– breast cancer derive benefit 
from HER2 signaling inhibitors. The data presented here 
suggests that an alternative test for HER2 status based on 
HER2 functional signaling activity (such as the CELx HSP 
test) could be useful for accurately determining patient 
eligibility for HER2 signaling inhibitors to maximize the 
therapeutic benefit. 
Studies have suggested that upregulation of HER2 
signaling in HER2- patients is caused by activating 
mutations in the extracellular or kinase domains of 
HER2 receptor [28].  In one of the largest clinical 
studies of HER2 mutations, Ross et al. report that in 
5,605 cases 10.6% had ERBB2 amplification, 2.4% had 
ERBB2 mutation where 0.7% had co-occurring ERBB2 
amplification and mutation with only about 11% of all 
mutations found affecting the extracellular (ligand binding 
and dimerization) domain of the receptor [29].  This very 
low percentage (2.4% × 11%) is significantly less than the 
20% level inferred from the 34 patient results reported 
in the present manuscript (20.5%; 95% CI = 10%–37%). 
While HER2 mutation may explain some HER2- patients’ 
dysfunctional HER2 signaling, it could likely explain, at 
most, one of our results.   Additionally, only costly DNA 
sequencing can uncover the mutants and the functional

implication of each and combinations thereof are still 
under investigation [30]. Thus, we believe our approach 
provides a more complete and thus applicable method to 
measuring HER2 signaling dysfunction in HER2- samples.
Previous studies using molecular and biochemical 
methods for refined assessment of HER2 levels and 
HER2 phosphorylation status have suggested that HER2 
phosphorylation above a threshold occurs in a subgroup 
of HER2– breast tumors [31–35]. In one of these recent 
studies using retrospective protein microarray analysis, 
the phosphorylation of HER2 and signaling proteins 
downstream of HER2 were measured.  The report concluded 
that a portion (8–16% of 140 samples in two groups) of the 
tested HER2– samples had phospho-HER2 levels correlated 
with phospho-HER2 levels of HER2+ samples.  However, 
the status of the PI3K/AKT and MAPK pathways, the 
two main effector pathways downstream of HER2, were 
not reported, functional activation of meaningful disease 
markers were not apparent, and discrepancies existed 
between methods used to prepare the samples for analysis 
[35].  Santarpia et al. [36] recently review biomarker 
studies in breast cancer and conclude: “It is likely that it 
is the combined effect of all genomic variations that drives 
the clinical behavior of a given cancer. Furthermore, entirely 
new classes of oncogenic events are being discovered in 
the noncoding areas of the genome and in noncoding RNA 
species driven by errors in RNA editing. In light of this 
complexity, it is not unexpected that, with the exception 
of HER2 amplification, no robust molecular predictors of 
benefit from targeted therapies have been identified.” 
Typically, the classical endpoint assays used in these 
studies provide incomplete, static information on HER2 
activation (i.e., phosphorylation at a limited number of 
sites on a limited number of targets, requiring a priori 
knowledge of all the potential dysfunctional processes) 
that may be somewhat correlative but may not be causally 
related to disease activity, drug function, and the status 
of the HER2 signaling network. Allosterism, differential 
phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, 
phosphorylation 
density, scaffolding assembly, signaling crosstalk, 
bistability or ultrasensitivity [37], and a myriad of 
mechanisms of drug resistance may also contribute to the 
quantitative and qualitative activity of the HER2 signaling 
pathway and all contribute to the difficulty in using a static 
gene or protein measurement to comprehensively quantify 
signaling pathway regulation that relates to drug response 
and therapeutic outcome prediction [38–40]. In contrast, 
using the CELx HSP test, data strongly suggests in this 
set of HER2–  tumors that HER2–HER3 hetero-dimers 
are the main driver of abnormally high ligand-dependent 
HER2 signaling.   Furthermore, in the present study, the 
CELx HSP test provides real-time functional monitoring 
of patient cell response to agonist (ligand) and antagonist 
(drug) in order to provide a more complete method of 
diagnosing HER2-driven disease than the HER2 protein 
or genetic assays currently used in the clinic.    This is the 
first study using diseased and healthy cells from patients 
ex vivo in a clinical test format for direct assessment of 
the functionality of the disease-related signaling pathways 
and determination whether a drug therapy has the intended 
effect on those cells. 
The present results would favor a hypothesis that if the 
mechanism of a disease, target activity, and drug response 
are all present in a patient’s cells ex vivo, the chance that the 
patient will respond to a targeted therapy will be increased. 
The scenario in vivo could be more complex when 
considering variables such as immune system complexity 
and heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment.
The approach described in this work suggests a path 
to developing more precise, personal, cancer diagnoses 
and treatment. In clinical use, the test would be performed 
as a CLIA/CAP certified Laboratory Developed Test 
(LDT) or an FDA cleared or approved in vitro diagnostic. 
 
The test itself would be performed in a central laboratory 
that would process the specimens, perform the test, and 
provide the result to the ordering clinician.  Prior to 
becoming available for clinical use, the CELx HSP test 
must first be analytically validated to confirm that the 
sensitivity and specificity of the test meets appropriate 
requirements, balancing the relative patient risk posed 
by a false positive versus a false negative result.  Once 
analytically validated, a prospective clinical trial designed 
to evaluate whether HER2-negative patients reported to 
have abnormal HER2-driven signaling using the CELx 
HSP test respond to treatment with anti-HER2 therapies 
would be performed.  
The authors developed and validated methods to 
collect tumor tissue at a clinical site and have it delivered 
overnight (< 24 hours) in fresh condition to a central test 
laboratory.  These methods, used in the present study, 
involve placing the specimen immediately after removal 
from the patient in a glucose-based solution designed 
to maintain the tissue in fresh condition and shipping 
it overnight in a kit designed to maintain temperature 
below 8°C to a central test laboratory.  For this and other 
related studies, clinical sites providing tissue specimens 
demonstrated 98% compliance with this collection 
protocol (N = 150). In the few cases where the collection 
protocol was not followed, proliferative cells were 
obtainable from 50% of the non-compliant collection, 
confirming the robust nature of these methods.
By analyzing the signaling activity in a patient’s 
live tumor cells, signaling abnormalities driving a cancer 
can be revealed that a genomic or proteomic test has not 
detected. The present data show no correlation between 
protein expression level and signaling activity in ER+/
HER2– primary cells. These results suggest a new subtype 
of breast cancer – HER2– (receptor expression normal)/
HER2Signal+ (signaling abnormal). If confirmed in future 
work with accredited validation studies, mouse xenografts, 
larger prevalence studies, and interventional studies of 
HER2– patients treated with HER2-targeted drugs, this

discovery would have significant clinical implications. 
 
Patients diagnosed with this new subtype of cancer would 
potentially benefit from anti-HER2 therapy. The CELx 
HSP test has the high potential to be developed into a 
clinical diagnostic test or confirmatory test for better 
informing physicians about HER2-driven diseases such 
as breast cancer or HER2-driven cancer in other tissues 
[41, 42]. Additionally, this novel method of identification 
of new cancer subtypes can drive development of new 
drugs or repurposing of existing drugs.  This tumor 
assessment technology may change the way personalized 
medicine is practiced in the future.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimen
Healthy and tumor specimens were obtained from 
excess resected human breast tissue from women over 
18 years of age undergoing standard-of care therapeutic 
surgery and histological diagnosis.  Tissues and supporting 
information were de-identified prior to delivery to 
Celcuity. Liberty/Chesapeake IRB (Columbia, MD) 
determined that this research did not involve human 
subjects as defined under 45 CFR 46.102(f) and issued a 
written IRB exemption. 
Fresh specimens were obtained from the University 
of Minnesota, Clinical and Translational Science Institute 
Biological Materials Procurement Network, (Minneapolis, 
MN) and Capitol Biosciences (Rockville, MD). 
 
All specimens were immersed in organ transplant solution 
within one hour of excision. The specimens from the 
University of Minnesota were shipped overnight in 
containers shown to maintain 0°C–8°C for 36 hours. 
The specimens from Capitol Biosciences were frozen as 
described further below and then transported on dry ice. 
The 34 tumor tissue specimens included in this study 
were from pre- and postmenopausal patients previously 
diagnosed with HER2– breast cancer at different clinical 
stages of advancement and with diverse histologies 
and lymph node status (Table 3).  A priori exclusion 
criteria for healthy tissue specimens were as follows: 
pathogenic viruses – HPV, HIV, HBV, HCV, HAV; benign 
cysts, phylloid/phyllodes tumor, or other non-cancerous 
abnormality; current or previous diagnosis or treatment 
for any cancer, diabetes, or thyroid disease. In addition, 
specimens from patients with known BRCA1 or BRCA2 
gene mutations were excluded to prevent inadvertent 
inclusion of patients who may have undiagnosed cancer. 
A de-identified copy of each patient’s pathology report 
was provided to the authors.  The different sections of the 
tumors were evaluated by a pathologist using standard 
clinical IHC protocol and those samples included in this 
study were HER2 0 or 1 (i.e. samples with HER2 2+ 
or HER2 3+ IHC scores were excluded) Tumor tissue 
specimen were collected from two providers as available 
between May 2013 and June 2015.  The 34 tumor 
and 16 healthy samples in this study were tested over 
approximately a four-week period.
Cell culture
Methods for tissue extraction, primary cell culture, 
and short-term population doublings are essentially as 
described previously [43, 44]. Briefly, 20–70mg tissue was 
minced with scalpels to < 2-mm pieces and cryopreserved 
until testing (Unisol, Cell and Tissue Systems, Charleston, 
SC) [45] or used fresh.  Tissue (20–40 mg) for CELx HSP 
testing was enzymatically disaggregated for minimal 
time to obtain cells and cell clusters in collagenase and 
hyaluronidase (Worthington Biochemical, Lakewood, NJ) 
at 37°C in 5% CO2. The disaggregated tissue was washed 
in culture media to remove disaggregation enzymes, plated 
on 6-well tissue culture plates in serum-free mammary 
epithelial cell media, and grown until approximately 
2 × 105 cells were available. Trypan blue staining was used 
before initial plating to determine the a priori viability 
of each specimen. After four days in culture, media was 
changed regularly. 
The DAKO IHC test standard breast cancer cell 
lines SKBr3 and MDA-231 were maintained according to 
provider’s instructions.  SKBr3 was grown in McCoy’s 
5A supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin/amphotericin (PSA).  MDA-231 was grown 
in Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium with 10%FBS and 1%PSA. 
All cell lines used in this study were authenticated by 
ATCC in March 2016 by comparison with the ATCC 
short-tandem repeat (STR) databases.
Flow ctometry
Antibodies used in this study are detailed in Table 4. 
Flow cytometry was performed on a BD FACSCalibur 
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) using cells harvested 
at the time of CELx HSP test using methods previously 
described by others [46].  Data were analyzed with FlowJo 
2 software (FlowJO, Ashland, OR). The flow cytometry 
studies conducted for this work produced results 100% 
concordant to the standard clinical IHC test evaluations for 
HER2, ER, and PR that were provided for each specimen 
by the clinic that provided the specimen. No samples with 
any HER2 overexpressing cells were included in this 
study.
CELx HER2 signaling profile (HSP) test 
HER2 signaling network activity was measured 
using the xCELLigence RTCA (ACEA Biosciences, San 
Diego, CA) as described elsewhere [11]. Briefly, cells 
were seeded in triplicate wells of 96-well sensor plates 
(pre-coated with collagen and fibronectin) in serum-free 
minimal medium (assay medium) the day before growth

factor treatment.  Impedance values were recorded 
throughout the whole course of an experiment. Drugs 
and inhibitors were added into the sensor plates at least 
eight hours prior to the addition of growth factors. Growth 
factors were added 18–24 hours after cell seeding. All 
reagents were dispensed with a VIAFLO automatic liquid 
handler (Integra Biosciences, Hudson, NH).
An NRG1b titration series from 375 pM to 12 nM 
and an EGF titration series from 25 pM to 800 pM were 
performed during assay development. A single dose of 
3 nM for NRG1b and a single dose of 0.3 nM for EGF 
were chosen for CELx HSP testing of all samples that 
represented a maximal signal plateau for samples with 
different levels of HER receptors.
Data analysis and statistics
Data were exported from the RTCA for analysis 
by TraceDrawer (Ridgeview Instruments, Sweden) 
and Microsoft Excel.  Impedance time course data was 
recorded for one of three categories of each cell sample 
tested: cells with addition of media only (C), cells with 
addition of growth factor stimulus only (CF), and cells 
with addition of an antagonist drug (HER2-specific 
dimerization blocker) followed by a growth factor stimulus 
(CDF).  To permit inter-sample quantitative comparison, 
CI values were set to zero for each set of CI time course 
data at the time stimulus was added to a cell sample.  By 
convention, the manufacturer converts impedance to cell

index units (Ci = W/15).  After the stimulus was added, 
data were assessed by one of the following algorithms. 
To determine the gross HER2 signaling activity resulting 
from growth factor stimulation, the formula CF–C was 
used. The signal accompanying the addition of each 
growth factor arises from hetero-dimerization that may 
occur if HER2 participates and any homo-dimerization of 
the receptor.  To determine the net HER2 participation in 
HER signaling initiated by a growth factor, the algorithm 
[(CF-C)-(CDF-C)] was used, where the values associated 
with the EGF and NRG1b stimulus and inhibition were 
combined to arrive at a total amount of HER2 signaling 
for a particular cell sample. 
To classify a HER2– sample as having abnormal 
signaling, a test cut-off value of 250 was established that 
was 90% of the upper range of the healthy responses and 
coincidental with the median test value for the sample set 
of HER2+ cell lines previously tested [11]. To confirm with 
95% confidence that at least 5% of HER2– patients have 
abnormal pathway signaling, assuming that 15% of the 
population would be abnormal, a sample size of 33 was 
required.    
To confirm cells from normal patients and those 
from the HER2+ cell lines generate different HER2 
signaling levels using the CELx HSP test, it was first 
assumed that normal breast cells have a median CELx 
HSP test value of 100 with a standard deviation of 100. 
To detect a 150 absolute difference (assuming 250 for 
HER2+ and 100 for normal) in test value between the two 
types of cells, with a two-sided α at 0.05 and 90% power, 
the required number of patients in the normal population 
and HER2+ population arms is 10 each.  Since only nine 
HER2+ positive cell lines were available, the sample size 
of the normal specimens was increased to 16 to offset the 
effect of the smaller HER2+ sample size. 
Pearson correlation analysis was performed with 
GraphPad Prism 6 to evaluate the relationships among 
the variables of interest.  All dose-response curves 
were obtained using nonlinear regression curve fitting 
with GraphPad Prism 6. Box-and-whisker plots were 
constructed to analyze the different groups’ CELx HSP test 
results. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
