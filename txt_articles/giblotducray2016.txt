Heat stress results in a multitude of biological and physiological responses which can become lethal if
not properly managed. It has been shown that heat stress causes significant adverse effects in both
human and animals. Different approaches have been proposed to mitigate the adverse effects caused by
heat stress, among which are special diet and probiotics. We characterized the effect of the yeast fer-
mentate EpiCor (EH) on the prevention of heat stress-related complications in rats. We found that in-
creasing the body temperature of animals from 37.170.2 to 40.670.2 °C by exposure to heat (45 °C for
25 min) resulted in significant morphological changes in the intestine. Villi height and total mucosal
thickness decreased in heat-stressed rats pre-treated with PBS in comparison with control animals not
exposed to the heat. Oral treatment of rats with EH before heat stress prevented the traumatic effects of
heat on the intestine. Changes in intestinal morphology of heat-stressed rats, pre-treated with PBS re-
sulted in significant elevation of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) level in the serum of these animals. Pre-
treatment with EH was effective in the prevention of LPS release into the bloodstream of heat-stressed
rats. Our study revealed that elevation of body temperature also resulted in a significant increase of the
concentration of vesicles released by erythrocytes in rats, pre-treated with PBS. This is an indication of a
pathological impact of heat on the erythrocyte structure. Treatment of rats with EH completely protected
their erythrocytes from this heat-induced pathology. Finally, exposure to heat stress conditions resulted
in a significant increase of white blood cells in rats. In the group of animals pre-treated with EH before
heat stress, the white blood cell count remained the same as in non-heated controls. These results
showed the protective effect of the EH product in the prevention of complications, caused by heat stress.

1. Introduction
Heat stress results in a multitude of pathological and physio-
logical responses which can become lethal if not properly mana-
ged. It was shown that heat stress causes significant morphological
changes in the gut (Bouchama et al., 2005; Chang et al., 2013). Data
to support these observations were obtained in human as well as
in animal studies. For example, it has been found that heat ex-
posure in pigs caused marked injury to the tips of the intestinal
villi, inducing epithelial cell shedding, exposing the intestinal
mucosa lamina propria, as well as shortening the villus height and
crypt depth in the small intestine (Yu et al., 2010). These mor-
phological changes clearly alter the integrity of the gastrointestinal
tract, which serves as a first line of defense to protect the host
from the internal environment of the gut containing bacteria and
endotoxins in the form of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Gram-
negative bacteria. Dysfunction of this protective barrier results in
increased intestinal permeability and diffusion of toxic bacterial
components from the gut lumen into the blood. The immune
system serves to actively remove LPS from the circulatory system
through the reticuloendothelial system of the liver, high-density
lipoproteins and anti-LPS antibodies. The precise mechanism of
injury and death from heat stress are proposed to arise from en-
dotoxaemia which develops when the rate of LPS clearance is not
consistent with the rate of LPS translocation from the gut (Lim and
Mackinnon, 2006). This situation triggers a systemic inflammatory
response that then leads to disseminated intravascular coagula-
tion, necrosis of organ tissues, and multi-organ failure. It was
previously reported that elevation of the body temperature during
heat stress causes an increase of the shedding of erythrocyte
membrane vesicles (Moore et al., 2013a, 2014). Vesicles constitute

 a heterogenic population of cell-derived microscopic size particles
that participate in a wide range of physiological and pathological
processes. More recently, it was shown that the aging erythrocyte
is characterized by changes in the plasma membrane, particularly
in vesiculation of the cell membrane. This process is termed as
eryptosis or programmed erythrocyte death. So heat causes a
deadly impact on the erythrocyte structure.
Different approaches are proposed for mitigation of heat stress
adverse effects, among which are special diet and probiotics. But
there is no data about the efficacy of prebiotics in mitigation of
stress-induced complications. EpiCor (EH) is a yeast (Sacchar-
omyces cerevisiae) fermentate. The fermentation produces a pro-
duct that is high in yeast metabolites, including vitamins, poly-
phenols, sterols, phospholipids and polysaccharides such as beta-
glucan. Previous studies showed that EH exhibits strong prebiotic
properties (Possemiers et al., 2011). This product possess sig-
nificant anti-inflammatory activity, selectively enhanced butyrate
production in vitro (Jensen et al., 2008a; Possemiers et al., 2013)
and supports mucosal defense in clinical trials (Jensen et al.,
2008b). We hypothesize that this yeast fermentate could be ef-
fective in the prevention of heat stress adverse effects.
The main objective of this work was to study the efficacy of the
prebiotic-like product EH, in the prevention of complications re-
lated to heat stress in rats.
2. Material and methods
2.1. Ethics statement
All animal procedures were approved by the Auburn University
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The study was
performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide
for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National In-
stitutes of Health.
2.2. Animals
Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats (Harlan Laboratories, In-
dianapolis, IN, USA) weighing 250–300 g were used in this study.
The animals were housed two per cage under specific pathogen-
free conditions and were acclimatized for 2 days at a temperature
(2071 °C), humidity (5075%) and lighting (12-h day/12-h night)
with free access to water and standard food (2018 Teklad Global
18% Protein Rodent Diet, Harlan, Indianapolis, IN, USA).
2.3. Yeast fermentate
The yeast fermentate product EpiCor (EH) was provided by the
manufacturer (Embria Health Sciences, Ankeny, IA, USA) in a
powder form. For oral treatment of rats, suspension of the yeast
fermentate in PBS was prepared at the rate 7 mg per kg of animal
weight in 1 mL of phosphate buffered saline (PBS).
2.4. Experimental design
A total of 32 rats was used in this study. One group (16 rats)
was fed a standard diet (basal diet) and the other group (16 rats)
received the same diet, but they were treated by oral gavage with
1 mL of yeast fermentate suspension. Animals were treated once a
day in the morning, every day for 14 days prior to the start of heat
stress (Fig. 1). At the same time control rats received 1 mL of PBS
by oral gavage. On day 15, rats in each group were subdivided (8
rats in each group), these groups were: 1) control (PBS/25 °C,
25 min), 2) EH (yeast fermentate/25 °C, 25 min), 3) stress (PBS/
45 °C, 25 min), and 4) EHþstress (yeast fermentate/45 °C, 25 min).
Animals from group 3 and 4 were exposed to 45 °C heat stress,
relative humidity 55% for 25 min in a pre-heated climatic chamber
(Environmental Chamber 6020-1, Caron, OH, USA). These condi-
tions were previously described to achieve acute heat stress in rats
(Moore et al., 2013a, 2014; Sachidhanandam et al., 2002). Control
animals (groups 1 and 2) were exposed to identical conditions as
the heat stressed animals, but at 25 °C. The animals had access to
food and water during and after heating. Rectal temperature was
measured for each rat before and immediately after heat stress
using an electronic digital thermometer, inserted to a depth of
4 cm (Moore et al., 2013a). Four hours after the heat stress ex-
periments, rats were anesthetized with isoflurane (2–4%) and eu-
thanized by rapid decapitation. Trunk blood was collected from
each rat into sterile apirogenic tubes to obtain serum. Samples of
blood were immediately taken for microscopic examination.
Samples of small intestine from each rat were taken for morpho-
logical analysis.
2.5. Blood serum preparation
Blood in the tubes was allowed to clot for 30 min in a re-
frigerator. Tubes were centrifuged at 20 °C, 7000g for 10 min.
Serum was collected and stored in 50 μl aliquots at �20 °C until
assay.
2.6. Histological analysis
2.6.1. Sample preparation
Samples of small intestine (0.5–2 cm in length) were im-
mediately fixed in Bouin's solution (Electron Microscopy Sciences,
Hatfield, PA, USA) for 10–15 min. Tissue samples were cut to
proper size (5–7 mm in length) and transferred to fixative to make
sure all tissues were completely immersed in fixative. The volume
of fixative was 20–30 times the tissue volume. After 48 h of fixa-
tion at room temperature, the excess fixative was washed out in
70% alcohol until most of the yellow color was removed. Washed
samples were put into tissue embedding cassettes (VWR, Radnor,
PA, USA) and kept in 70% alcohol until processing in the Auto-
mated tissue processor (Tissue-Tek VIP, Miles/Sakura, Torrance, CA,
USA). After processing, samples were embedded in paraffin blocks
using embedding center (Tissue-Tek TEC, Sakura, Torrance, CA,
USA). Embedded tissue was sectioned at 6 mm using the micro-
tome (Reichert-Jung 2040 Autocut, Leica Biosystems Nussloch
GmbH, Heidelberger Straße 17-19, 69226 Nussloch, Germany).
2.6.2. Sample staining
Hematoxylin – eosin (H&E) staining was performed according to
the standard protocol (Stevens, 1990), using Mayer's haemotoxylin
and Eosin Y (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA). Briefly,
sections were deparaffinized in Hemo-De � 3 changes for 8 min,
5 min and 5 min, cleared in 100% ETOH� 2 changes – 2 min each,
followed by 95% ETOH� 2 – 2 min each and 80% ETOH – 2 min.

 Sections were rinsed with distilled water and stained with hema-
toxylin for 2–3 min. Samples were washed in running tap water for
about 5 min, put in 80% ETOH for 2 min and stained in eosin for 1–
2 min. After staining, sections were put in 70% ETOH – 2 min, 95%
ETOH� 2 – 2 min each, 100% ETOH� 2 – 2 min each, Hemo-De� 2
changes until clear (5 min, 10 min or longer). Mounting of the
samples was performed using Eukitt Mounting Medium (Electron
Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA).
2.6.3. Measurements
Intestinal villi height and total mucosal thickness were mea-
sured for each sample using a high resolution microscope system
(Vainrub et al., 2006). Only stained sections in which the mucosal
villi were cut along their longitudinal axis were analyzed. The villi
height was measured as a distance from the apex of the villus to
the base of the cript; total mucosal thickness – from the top of the
villus to the muscularis mucosae. Twenty measurements of each
parameter in each sample were taken and expressed in micro-
meters. An average of these measurements was expressed as a
mean villi height and total mucosal thickness for one treatment
group.
2.7. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) assay
Serum concentration of LPS was analyzed by the Pierce LAL
Chromogenic
Endotoxin
Quantitation
Kit
(Thermo
Scientific,
Rockford, IL) using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) assay ac-
cording to the manufacturer's recommendations. The sensitivity of
the assay was 0.1 EU mL-1 (0.01 ng endotoxin per mL). Sterile
pyrogen-free plastic and glassware were used throughout the
assay.
2.8. Cortisol assay
Cortisol concentration in serum of animals in all groups was
analyzed by Rat Cortisol ELISA Kit (NeoBioLab, Cambridge, MA)
according to the manufacturer's instruction. The sensitivity of this
assay was 1.0 ng mL-1. Cortisol ELISA Assay Kit is a competitive
immunoenzymatic colorimetric method for quantitative determi-
nation of cortisol concentration in serum.
2.9. IL-10 cytokine assay
Serum level of IL-10 cytokine was measured using the com-
mercial rat cytokine-specific sandwich ELISA kit for IL-10 (In-
vitrogen Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions. Optical density values were measured at
450 nm using a microplate reader (Bio-Tek, Winooski, VT). The
cytokine content of each sample was determined by comparison of
mean experimental values with curve generated using standards,
supplied with the kit. The minimum detectable dose of IL-10 kits
was o5 pg/mL .
2.10. High resolution light microscopy of the blood
The images of fresh blood were recorded with a super-resolu-
tion light microscope system described in Vainrub et al. (Vainrub
et al., 2006). Test images were calibrated using a Richardson slide
(Richardson, 1988). A small droplet (7 μl) of freshly drawn blood
was placed on a glass slide, coverslipped and positioned on the
microscope stage with oil contacts between condenser and ob-
jective lenses. Ten image frames of 72 � 53.3 μm2 in each sample
were videotaped, and concentrations of white blood cells and
vesicles count and diameter were measured by Image-Pro Plus
software (Media Cybernetics), providing high-resolution direct-
view optical images in real time. The samples were observed in an
aqueous environment and required no freezing, dehydration,
staining, shadowing, marking or any other manipulation. At least
20 image frames were analyzed for each animal. Each frame
contained between 50 and 200 vesicles (depending on conditions).
2.11. Statistics
All results were presented as a mean and standard deviation.
The difference between groups were analyzed by the one-way
ANOVA, followed by the Bonferroni test. The significance level was
set at 0.05 to define statistical significance. Statistical calculations
and graph plotting were carried out using Microcal™ Origin ver-
sion 9.0 (Northhampton, MA) and 2010 Microsoft Excel.
3. Results
3.1. Body temperature
Exposure of rats to high temperature resulted in a significant
increase of body temperature. The mean body temperature (°C) of
rats before and immediately after heat stress was 37.470.2 and
40.670.2 (po0.05) respectively in group 4 (EH) and 37.170.2
and 40.470.4 (po0.05) respectively in group 3 (PBS). No central
nervous system abnormalities such as convulsions, or coma in
animals during or after heat stress, as well as after 4 h recovery
were noticed. Body temperature of rats in control groups (groups
1 and 2) was stable during the experiment.
3.2. Morphometric analysis of the intestine
Villi height and total mucosal thickness in control rats, not
exposed to heat were 612.878.3 mm and 739.978.0 mm respec-
tively (group 1 – PBS/25 °C) and 613.477.1 mm and 740.677.7 mm
respectively (group 2 – EH/25 °C) (Fig. 2 A and B; Fig. 3). Exposure
of rats pre-treated with PBS to heat stress conditions (group 3 –
PBS/45 °C) significantly decreased villi height and total mucosal
thickness – 394.177.5 mm and 526.578.7 mm accordingly. Treat-
ment of rats with EH before heat stress prevented the damage
effect of heat on intestinal morphology. In this group of rats (group
4 – EH/45 °C) parameters for villi height and total mucosal thick-
ness were similar to the control rats.
3.3. Microscopic evaluation of the blood
The concentration of free vesicles in the blood of control rats
was
(1.7070.07) � 109
particles
mL�1
(PBS
treated)
and
(1.8070.07) � 109 vesicles mL�1 (EH treated) – Fig. 4A. Significant
increase of vesicle concentration was found in heat-stressed rats,
pre-treated with PBS (Figs. 4A and 5). No change of free vesicle
concentration was found in rats treated with EH and exposed to
heat stress conditions (Fig. 4A). The diameter of vesicles also sig-
nificantly increased only in the blood of rats treated with PBS
before heat stress (Fig. 4B). Pre-treatment with EH prevented the
formation of large vesicles in the blood. We also found a significant
increase of white blood cell (WBC) concentration in the blood of
rats exposed to heat after treatment with PBS (Fig. 6). No change in
the number of WBC (in comparison with control groups) was
found in the blood of heat-stressed rats pre-treated with EH.
3.4. Serum LPS concentration
Levels of LPS significantly increased in serum of heat-stressed
animals which received PBS before heat exposure in comparison
with EH-treated heated rats and rats in both control groups
(Fig. 7). Concentration of LPS in the serum of rats pre-treated with

28
 EH before heat stress was not different from the LPS level in serum
of animals from control groups.
3.5. Serum cortisol level
The serum cortisol level was stable in the rats of the different
groups. Cortisol level in heat stressed rats pre-treated with PBS in
comparison with control PBS-treated rats was 23.3071.48 ng mL�1
and 20.3071.48 ng mL�1 respectively. The concentration of serum
cortisol in rats pre-treated with EH before exposure to heat stress
conditions was comparable with the level registered in the serum of
control EH-treated rats (19.3071.47 mL�1 and 22.8071.48 ng mL�1
respectively).
3.6. IL-10 in serum
No significant change in the level of serum IL-10 of rats in dif-
ferent groups was found (3.4070.14–6.8270.38 pg mL�1 in heat
stressed and control EH groups respectively and 4.6070.34–
4.0470.18 pg mL�1 in stressed and control PBS groups respectively).
4. Discussion
This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of yeast fe-
mentate EH in the prevention of heat stress-induced adverse
effects in rats. The rat model of acute heat stress described

 by Sachidhanandam et al. (2002) was used in our study. We ex-
plored this model in our previous experiments (Moore et al.,
2013a, 2014). The conditions of the model (45 °C for 25 min) re-
sulted in increase of body temperature of rats to 40.370.2 °C. The
standard deviation of body temperature after heat stress indicated
small variability between animals. No central nervous system ab-
normalities such as convulsions, or coma in animals during or after
heat stress, as well as after 4 h recovery were noticed. So we can
assume that this model of heat stress is a humane model because
the exposure to heat is very brief and does not result in mortality
of animals, but leads to the manifestation of the acute heat stress
symptoms. Thus, it was found that the increase of the body tem-
perature of animals exposed to heat stress conditions resulted in
significant morphological changes in the intestine. Villi height and

 total mucosal thickness decreased in heat-stressed rats pre-treated
with PBS in comparison with control animals not exposed to the
heat. Treatment of rats with EH before heat stress prevented the
traumatic effect of heat on the intestine because the results of
measurements of villi height and total mucosal thickness in this
group of animals were the same as in the control groups. We can
speculate that mucosal immune protection by EH reported pre-
viously (Jensen et al., 2008b) can contribute to the gut integrity.
Changes in intestinal morphology of heat-stressed rats, pre-
treated with PBS, resulted in significant elevation of LPS level in
the serum of these animals. These findings are in accordance with
our previous data (Moore et al., 2014) and with the results of other
authors (Lambert, 2004; Lambert et al., 2002). LPS derived from
the gut was shown to be critical in the development of various
pathological conditions in humans and animals. Thus, LPS was
identified as one of the triggering factors of metabolic diseases,
chronic low-grade inflammation (Cani et al., 2007) and liver dis-
orders (Minemura and Shimizu, 2015). LPS plays an important role
in the development of a distinct depressive-like behavioral syn-
drome in animals (O’Connor et al., 2009) and depression in hu-
mans (Maes et al., 2008; Yirmiya, 1996). Elevated levels of LPS in
blood (endotoxemia) were documented in patients with heat-
stroke, ultramarathon runners (Ryan et al., 1994), during ex-
haustive physical exercise (Ashton et al., 2003) and in patients
with severe forms of autism (Emanuele et al., 2010). It was found
that endotoxemia is a result of the altered intestinal barrier
function and increased gastrointestinal permeability. Normal gut
microbiota play a critical role in the maintaining of the gut barrier
function (Hooper and Gordon, 2001; Natividad and Verdu, 2013).
In this study, pre-treatment with EH prevented LPS release into
circulation in rats exposed to heat. We can speculate that bene-
ficial modulation of gut microbiota and anti-inflammatory activity
of EH, demonstrated previously (Possemiers et al., 2013), con-
tribute to the protective effect of this yeast fermentate.
In our previous study, we showed that heat stress results in an
increase of the shedding of erythrocyte membrane vesicles (Moore
et al., 2013a, 2013b). Vesiculation of the cell membrane is related
to the aging of erythrocyte (Bosman et al., 2008; Ghashghaeinia
et al., 2012) and is termed as eryptosis or programmed erythrocyte
death (Lang and Lang, 2015). This study revealed that the elevation
of the body temperature resulted in a significant increase of the
concentration of vesicles in the blood of rats, compared to PBS-
treated rats before heat exposure. This is an indication of a pa-
thological impact of heat on the erythrocyte structure of this group
of animals. Treatment of rats with EH completely protected their
erythrocytes from the pathology, caused by heat stress. Our data
are in accordance with previously published results about bene-
ficial effects of EH on erythrocyte health (Jensen et al., 2008b).
A significant shift to a higher vesicle diameter was also in-
dicated as an adverse effect of heat stress (Moore et al., 2013a). The
results of this study showed that treatment with EH prevented rats
from this adverse effect of heat stress. Exposure to heat stress
conditions resulted in a significant increase of white blood cell
(WBC) counts in rats, pre-treated with PBS. This result is in ac-
cordance with the findings of other authors, showed elevated le-
vels of WBC in stressed animals (Matur et al., 2016; Peli et al.,
2013). In the group of animals treated with EH before heat stress,
the white blood cell count remained the same as in control groups.
We did not find significant changes in serum IL-10 levels in
different groups of rats. These results confirmed previously ob-
tained data that consumption of EH does not alter the level of
serum IL-10 (Jensen et al., 2008b).
The level of cortisol was consistent in all groups of animals.
Literature data show that cortisol level can be stable during stress
(Radahmadi et al., 2006) or even can be decreased during 2–4 h
after heat stress (McMorris et al., 2006).
Our previous results showed that the thermodynamic data for
rat environmental hyperthermia and human exercise-induced
temperature increase are consistent with each other and agree
well with thermodynamic literature results (Vodyanoy, 2015).
Future directions of this study will help to understand the feasi-
bility of our approach not only in environmental heat stress but
also in heat stress, related to physical activity.
5. Conclusion
Our study showed a significant protective effect of EH against
heat stress-related adverse effects in a rat model. Pre-treatment of
animals with EH before exposure to heat protected gut morphol-
ogy, prevented increase of LPS in blood and pathological impact of
heat stress on blood erythrocytes. Further study of EH efficacy
during heat stress will lead to a better understanding of the me-
chanisms of this protection, and to develop new approaches for
the prevention of heat stress-induced adverse effects in the gut.
