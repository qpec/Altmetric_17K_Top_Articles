Purpose: Osteoporosis is asymptomatic morbidity of the elderly which develops slowly over 
several years. Osteoporosis diagnosis has typically involved Fracture Risk Assessment (FRAX) 
followed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in specialist care. Point-of-care pulse-
echo ultrasound (PEUS) was developed to overcome DXA-related access issues and to enable 
faster fracture prevention treatment (FPT) initiation. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the cost-effectiveness of two proposed osteoporosis management (POMs: FRAX→PEUS-if-
needed→DXA-if-needed→FPT-if-needed) pathways including PEUS compared with the current 
osteoporosis management (FRAX→DXA-if-needed→FPT-if-needed).
Materials and methods: Event-based probabilistic cost–utility model with 10-year duration 
for osteoporosis management was developed. The model consists of a decision tree for the 
screening, testing, and diagnosis phase and is followed by a Markov model for the estimation of 
incidence of four fracture types and mortality. Five clinically relevant patient cohorts (potential 
primary FPT in women aged 75 or 85 years, secondary FPT in women aged 65, 75, or 85 years) 
were modeled in the Finnish setting. Generic alendronate FPT was used for those diagnosed 
with osteoporosis, including persistence overtime. Discounted (3%/year) incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio was the primary outcome. Discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), 
payer costs (year 2016 value) at per patient and population level, and cost-effectiveness accept-
ability frontiers were modeled as secondary outcomes.
Results: POMs were cost-effective in all patient subgroups with noteworthy mean per patient 
cost savings of €121/76 (ranges €107–132/52–96) depending on the scope of PEUS result 
interpretation (test and diagnose/test only, respectively) and negligible differences in QALYs 
gained in comparison with current osteoporosis management. In the cost-effectiveness accept-
ability frontiers, POMs had 95%–100% probability of cost-effectiveness with willingness to pay 
€24,406/QALY gained. The results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Even when assuming a 
high cost of PEUS (up to €110/test), POMs were cost-effective in all cohorts.
Conclusion: The inclusion of PEUS to osteoporosis management pathway was cost-effective.

Introduction
Osteoporosis is a typically asymptomatic morbidity of the elderly which develops 
slowly over several years.1–3 Osteoporosis weakens the bones through bone loss after 
the age of 40 years and increases bone loss after menopause and during the final years 
of life, making them fragile and more likely to break. Osteoporosis diagnosis often 
occurs only after a minor fall or sudden impact causes a bone fracture.4–6 Clinically,

the World Health Organization defines osteoporosis with 
reference to bone mineral density. Bone mineral density in 
adults is usually denoted by its T-score relative to the peak 
bone mass distribution in healthy women aged 20–40 years, 
and a T-score ≤−2.5 indicates osteoporosis.7
Osteoporosis is a common illness with a prevalence esti-
mate of 400,000 (around 7.3% of the population in the year 
2016)8 in Finland. Each year, ~6,000 first and 1,000 repeat hip 
fractures and a total of 30,000–40,000 osteoporosis-related 
fractures occur5 mostly in patients without osteoporosis 
diagnosis.6 Although the incidences of some fractures have 
decreased in Finland (potentially due to improved functional 
ability, osteoporosis management, and other measures),9–12 
there is an increase in incidence of some fractures.13–15 The 
fracture peak may be just emerging in countries such as 
Finland that had a high birth rate after the second world war, 
because the incidence of fractures increases exponentially 
with age.5 Globally, osteoporosis management is a concern 
in postmenopausal women. Approximately 40% of women 
and about 14% of men over 50 years of age will have a hip, 
vertebral or wrist fracture in their remaining lifetime.16–18
Besides the recommendation of adequate dietary cal-
cium and vitamin D intake5 (211,833 and 6,050 Finns with 
reimbursement for calcium and vitamin D in the year 2016, 
respectively), reimbursed fracture prevention treatments 
(FPTs) in Finland can include hormone replacement therapy 
(190,194 estrogen, 15,925 testosterone), bisphosphonates 
(31,549: alendronate [22,028], risedronate [6,310], iban-
dronate [3,139], clodronate [229], zoledronic acid [54]), 
denosumab (15,610), strontium ranelate (530), teriparatide 
(457), and calcitonin (22).19 In osteoporosis management, two 
types of osteoporotic fracture prevention are distinguished: 
primary osteoporotic fracture prevention, which aims to 
prevent any osteoporosis-related fracture, and secondary 
osteoporotic fracture prevention, which aims to prevent 
subsequent osteoporosis-related fracture in osteoporotic 
individuals who have already suffered a fracture.
Osteoporosis testing of high-risk populations is effective. 
The high-risk populations for the testing include women aged 
>65 years with other risk factors such as heavy smoking or 
parental osteoporosis-related fracture; or individuals with 
fracture due to low-energy impact; comorbidities or phar-
macologic therapies increasing osteoporosis risk; incidental 
observations on X-rays; or unexplained body height loss.5 
However, identifying the high risk is difficult, and testing 
bone mineral density in all is not indicated.7 Recent guide-
lines4,5,20,21 and Finnish practice22 recommend that the 10-year 
fracture risk, estimated using the proprietary Fracture Risk 
Assessment (FRAX) tool,23 should be used to screen potential 
osteoporosis for testing bone mineral density.
The medical need for effective on-site diagnostics is high, 
because around three-quarters of osteoporosis cases remain 
undiagnosed24 and many osteoporotic individuals are not 
identified until they experience fracture. Thus, potentially 
more than three-quarters of osteoporotic individuals do not 
receive any FPT. This is no surprise, as osteoporosis testing 
with the current methods alone is challenging.6
To overcome the limitations of using mostly radiographic, 
large diagnostic tools which are rarely available in primary 
care facilities, a novel handheld device based on the pulse-
echo ultrasound technology (pulse-echo ultrasonometry or 
ultrasonography [PEUS], Bindex®; Bone Index Finland, 
Kuopio, Finland) was developed.25–29 PEUS is used as a 
point-of-care osteoporosis testing-diagnosis tool after FRAX 
screening and it can help avoid dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry (DXA) for most postmenopausal women.25,26,29 The bone 
mineral density estimates obtained using PEUS have corre-
lated very well with those obtained with the DXA method26,28 
and are associated with clinically confirmed fractures in the 
previous 5 years.25 The DXA has been the gold standard of 
choice in the bone mineral density-based diagnostics.5,20,21,30
The cost-effectiveness of current care-based conventional 
osteoporosis management (COM)4,5,7,20–22 and two proposed 
osteoporosis managements (POM) including FRAX screening, 
testing, diagnosis, and FPT if needed was modeled. Based on a 
literature search in the PubMed database, no assessments have 
been published on the subject matter. Overall, evidence-based 
health economic evaluations including the screening, testing, 
diagnosing, and FPT have been rarely conducted.
Materials and methods
The Patients-Intervention-Comparator-Outcome-Setting-
Time-Effects-Perspective-Sensitivity analysis (PICOSTEPS) 
principle was applied.31,32 PICOSTEPS is in line with a health 
technology assessment guideline prepared by the Finnish 
Medicines Agency,33 and Finnish official guidance for the 
cost-effectiveness analyses attached with pharmaceuticals 
reimbursement applications submitted to the Finnish Phar-
maceuticals Pricing Board.34 Furthermore, PICOSTEPS 
describes the essential components of evidence-based health 
economic and outcomes research analytical framework in the 
order of importance.31

75 or 85 years with primary or secondary osteoporotic frac-
ture prevention.5 The other characteristics were: T-score −2.8 
(normal distribution, 95% CI −3.1 to −2.5) for osteoporotic 
and −0.25 (95% CI −1.00 to 0.50) for non-osteoporotic,23 
and no parental hip fracture, oral glucocorticoid therapy, 
rheumatoid arthritis, or alcoholism. The potential events 
included hip (institutionalized to long-term care after the 
hip fracture or not institutionalized), vertebral, wrist, and 
other fractures.

COM (FRAX→DXA-if-needed→FPT-if-needed). COM as 
a comparator was based on its clinical rationale and recom-
mendation in Finland5 and elsewhere.4,7,20–22,30 POM was 
included as the intervention based on its results25–29 and 
potential affordability.
The need for PEUS and/or DXA in the model is based on 
the age-dependent FRAX,23 which predicts the 10-year frac-
ture risk to help the clinical decision making.5,23 If the 10-year 
fracture risk exceeded the age-dependent threshold values of 
5.9% (age 65–74 years), 11.7% (75–84), or 19.8% (85–) in 
the FRAX screening, intermediate fracture risk was present 
and bone mineral density was assessed (i.e., the individual 
underwent PEUS and/or DXA). If the 10-year fracture risk 
was below the age-dependent threshold values in the FRAX 
screening, low fracture risk was present and lifestyle advice 
and reassurance were given.
Outcome
The key outcome of the analysis was an incremental cost-
effectiveness ratio: the difference in simulated costs divided 
by the difference in simulated effectiveness. Also, the 
mean costs and effectiveness were presented as secondary 
outcomes.
Setting
The event-based modeling approach with a clinical decision 
tree and a Markov extrapolation model35,36 was selected to 
capture all relevant data and to simulate (5,000 iterations) 
the comprehensive osteoporosis management in Finland 
using Microsoft Excel 2016 with Visual Basic for Appli-
cations. A decision tree analysis was done to model the 
screening–testing–diagnosis process preceding the potential 
initiation of FPT (Figure 1). A Markov modeling followed 
to assess the fractures and FPT (Figure 2). The event-based 
modeling strategy was carried out as follows: specify diag-
nosis and determine initial cohort distribution, define the 
natural history of the disease (i.e., events and their risks), 
apply relative risk modifiers (i.e., patient characteristics 
and treatments), compute costs and effectiveness, and run 
the simulation model.
Testing and diagnosis: decision tree model
The osteoporosis screening–testing–diagnosis decision tree 
model (Figure 1) included COM and POM, and their sensi-
tivity and specificity. FRAX constituted the initial screening 
tool common to both pathways,23 with a mean accuracy rate 
of 1.000 (assumed normal 0.975–1.025 95% CI).

Osteoporosis management: cost-effectiveness of pulse-echo ultrasound
283
In the decision tree, PEUS was calibrated to the 90% 
sensitivity–specificity threshold in accordance with the Inter-
national Society for Clinical Densitometry guidelines37,38 and 
modeled using Dirichlet distribution (i.e., altogether 10% of 
PEUS results are false negatives or false positives and have 
incorrect osteoporosis management). Thus, cost-effectiveness 
analysis with correct and incorrect treatment pathways was 
needed to evaluate how much effectiveness is potentially lost 
when using the POM.
In the POM pathway A (POMA, Figure 1) of the deci-
sion tree, 32.6% of individuals have ambiguous PEUS 
results (between the 90% sensitivity–specificity calibration 
thresholds).26 These individuals require and are  provided a 
DXA measurement to verify the diagnosis. A recent real-
world study confirmed the proportion of ambiguous PEUS 
results with the need of sending 32.5% of individuals to 
DXA investigation after PEUS measurement.29 In POMA, 
both false positives and negatives occur up to 10% of the 
patients in total and are modeled accordingly. These results 
constituted initial cohort distribution for the Markov model 
in the case of POMA. Thus, in the POMA strategy, PEUS 
is used for osteoporosis testing and diagnosis,25–29 which is 
a potentially common strategy in the Finnish public sector 
based on the clinical and economic rationale.
In the POM pathway B (POMB, Figure 1) of the decision 
tree, both ambiguous and osteoporotic PEUS results require 
and receive a DXA measurement, which eliminates the false 
positives. These results constituted the initial cohort distribu-
tion for the Markov model in the case of POMB. Thus, in the 
POMB strategy, PEUS is used for osteoporosis testing only 
and a positive diagnosis is confirmed with DXA, which can 
be a potentially common strategy in, for example, the USA.
Bone fractures and prevention: Markov model
The fractures and FPT were modeled with a Markov state 
transition model. The transitions were determined by clinical 
outcomes and a hierarchy of fractures was assumed, with hip 
fractures being more serious than vertebral fractures, which 
were in turn more serious than wrist and other fractures 
 
(Figure 2). Due to the duration of the fractures and available 
data, the Markov model had a 3-month cycle. Hip and verte-
bral fractures were represented as tunnel states because their 
costs and mortality depended on the time since the fracture. 
A state was used to model the proportion of individuals who 
were permanently institutionalized after a hip fracture.
In osteoporosis, the fracture risk can be reduced through 
FPT. A review of postmenopausal osteoporosis FPTs has 
been recently published,39 and alendronate once weekly is 
recommended as the first-line FPT in Finland.5 In addition, 
generic alendronate is the most affordable FPT40 with a high 
number of reimbursements in Finland19 and it is also likely 
to be a cost-effective FPT.
Time
The modeling was limited to 10 years due to the age of 
most individuals, potential changes in the FPTs, and limited 
knowledge regarding the extrapolated effects beyond 10 years 
(FRAX represents 10-year risk).7,23 Conversions between 
rates and probabilities were performed using the common 
transformation methodology.41 The annual discounting rate 
of effectiveness and costs was 3%.33,34
Effects
The long-term Markov fracture and FPT modeling included 
hip, vertebra, wrist, and other fractures. Finnish FRAX col-
laboration data demonstrated the 10-year risk of hip or any 
fracture in Finland per individual’s age, bone mineral density 
(T-score), and number of risk factors.7,23 To find osteoporotic 
fractures, US-based data on the age- and sex-specific relative 
risk of fracture attributable to osteoporosis were used.42 Rela-
tive risk for fracture was increased in individuals with a prior 
fracture, which could be accounted for by using the FRAX 
risk lookup, where prior fracture is one of the risk factors.23 
The age-dependent results on the fracture rates in the USA 
were then used to split the Finnish 10-year risk estimate of 
any fracture into component types of vertebra, wrist, or other 
fracture and modelled in the Markov model.42 The fracture 
prevention Markov model concurred with the health states 
used in earlier evaluations.43 Furthermore, institutionaliza-
tion risk to long-term facility after hip fracture was modeled 
based on the Finnish real-world evidence.44
Alendronate 70 mg/week FPT was modeled for osteo-
porotic individuals. For them, the fracture occurrence was 
adjusted downward based on the distributional efficacy 
estimated from a published meta-analysis of FPT.45,46 Sub-
optimal FPT uptake (adherence) based on 20% adherence at 
5 years modified the efficacy through persistence to mimic 
the real-world situation.47,46 In line with this modeling study, 
the study included postmenopausal women, naive to bisphos-
phonates, who received a first prescription of alendronate.47 
No rebound was assumed (i.e., FPT effect stops at the time 
of FPT discontinuation; Table 1).
The individuals can die from any health state. The back-
ground mortality was modeled based on the year 2016 offi-
cial Finnish mortality statistics,48 excluding deaths due to 
osteoporosis (10th revision of the International Statistical

Classification of Diseases codes M80 or M81).48,49 The 
FPT had an indirect effect through fractures to mortality. 
An elevated mortality relative risk of 4.53 during the first 
6 months after the hip or vertebral fracture (1.75 in the 
subsequent 6 months and 1.78 thereafter) was modeled.50,42 
Wrist or other fractures were not considered to increase 
mortality.
Finally, health-related quality of life was modeled using 
nationally representative age-, income-, education-, marital 
status-, and morbidity-adjusted Finnish EuroQol 5-dimen-
sional 3-level scores for women based on a Tobit model,51 and 
multiplicative health-related quality of life losses associated 
with the fractures.46,52 The EuroQol 5-dimensional 3-level 
scores used represent the most suitable health-related quality 
of life for a postmenopausal woman available for the Finn-
ish modeling purposes. Alendronate use was conservatively 
assumed to be associated with reduction in health-related 
quality of life (Table 1).
Perspective
The analysis included direct costs based on the Finnish 
guidance,33,34 and applied third-party payer perspective com-
mon in the guidance of many European countries.53–62 The 
analysis included direct health-related costs (e.g., patient 
co-payments, FPTs, treatments, visits, hospitalizations, 
traveling)33,34 and excluded taxes, productivity losses (e.g., 
absenteeism, presenteeism, sickness allowances, pensions), 
other income transfers, and time costs.
Costs
The Finnish weekly cost of the most affordable generic 
alendronate 70 mg was €1.70, excluding value-added tax.40 
Fracture-associated costs were estimated based on the Finn-
ish resource use in a representative national register study,44 
which was valued with the national Finnish unit costs63 
according to real values in the year 2016 (Table 2).64 The 
national health care costs63 were converted to year 2016 
values using the latest official Finnish Communal Expenses 
Index for health care.64 Traveling costs65 were converted to 
2016 real values using the transportation section of the latest 
official Finnish Consumer Price Index.66 Due to lack of data, 
a recursive fracture was considered to have the same costs 
and consequences as the first fracture.
Proprietary FRAX was available free of charge.23  
Finnish 
year 2016 price lists of hospital districts were searched to find 
the prices of DXA measurements. A price of €268 (incl. visit 
price) could be a representative input value (i.e., average of 
most affordable prices per district incl. visit was €297.50), 
with the lowest (€124.00, probably not feasible) and highest 
(€476.00) costs. The mean cost of specialist visit and the 
mean cost of DXA measurement alone would be €313.76 
and €67.50, respectively, that is, a total of €381.26. However,

Osteoporosis management: cost-effectiveness of pulse-echo ultrasound
285
for conservative results, €87.00 was used as the base case 
input for DXA cost. Thus, the total cost of DXA included one 
primary care doctor visit and travel (€133.26), the DXA test 
(€87.00, excluding visit) on the official Finnish price lists 
for communal invoicing, travels (€78.18),65,66 call (€27.88), 
and statement (€21.45).63,64
The total cost of the PEUS single-site test included pri-
mary care nurse visit and travel (€66.77),63–66 call (€27.88) 
and statement (€21.45),63,64 and PEUS test (€50.00), and 
the total cost of the DXA specified above for the proportion 
of individuals undergoing the DXA in POM. The assumed 
cost of PEUS may overestimate the true PEUS cost to Finn-
ish health care.
Willingness to pay
A complicating factor when interpreting the results of cost-
effectiveness analysis in the Finnish setting is the lack of an 
official willingness-to-pay threshold,67–69 a specific limit for 
additional investment to an additional quality-adjusted life 
year (QALY) gained.
In the UK, the most plausible willingness-to-pay thresh-
old in non-end-of-life situations is £20,00060 (€24,406, mean 
exchange rate €1=£0.81948 in the year 2016),70 or maybe, in 
some cases, up to £30,000 (€36,609) per QALY gained.60,70 
These willingness-to-pay thresholds may also be valid for the 
screening–testing–diagnosing–osteoporotic fracture preven-
tion if needed process in Finland.67–69
Sensitivity
The robustness of results was tested using one-way and mul-
tiway sensitivity analysis scenarios. These included Patient, 
Setting, and Effects.
The sensitivity of probabilistic analysis was implemented 
based on distributions, and results were depicted in terms 
of a cost-effectiveness acceptability frontier.71 The frontier 
showed the optimal strategies with the highest expected mon-
etary net benefit (pay-off) as a function of willingness to pay.
Results
The average absolute costs saved with POMA vs. COM were 
€121/patient (1.3%), ranging from €107/patient (75 years 
old, primary or secondary osteoporotic fracture prevention) 
to €132/patient (85 years old, secondary osteoporotic frac-
ture prevention). The relative savings with POMA ranged 
from 1.0%/patient (75 years old, secondary osteoporotic 
fracture prevention) to 1.7%/patient (65 years old, second-
ary osteoporotic fracture prevention). The average absolute 
costs saved with POMB vs. COM were €76/patient (0.8%), 
ranging from €52/patient (0.5%; 75 years old, secondary 
osteoporotic fracture prevention) to €96/patient (1.1%; 
85 years old, primary osteoporotic fracture prevention), as 
shown in Table 3.
In a setting of 40,000 tested women per year, POMA 
could result in potential annual cost savings of around 
€4.8 million (range €4.3–5.3 million depending on the

patient group). The respective potential annual cost savings 
with POMB could be €3.0 (€2.1–3.8) million.
Cost-effectiveness
COM resulted in a marginal average QALY gain of 0.001 
in comparison with POMA. Due to the negligible QALY 
gain and additional costs, COM was not cost-effective (the 
incremental cost-effectiveness ratios range from €60,000 
to 308,000/QALY gained) vs. POMA with the common 
willingness-to-pay threshold values. However, POMB domi-
nated COM, as it resulted in negligible or similar QALY gain 
with lower costs (Table 3).
Sensitivity analyses
Multiple one-way and multiway sensitivity analysis scenarios 
were used (Table 4).
For the COM vs. POMA comparison, these sensitivity 
analyses scenarios included the following:
• A. Base case
• B. Mean T-score of −3.5 (severe osteoporosis)
• C. No discounting
• D. Discounting 5%/year
• E. 50% initiate FPT
• F. 75% initiate FPT
• G. 10% adherent to FPT at 5 years
• H. 30% adherent to FPT at 5 years
• I. No disutility due to FPT
• J. DXA cost of €124.00 (the most affordable cost based 
on the cost review)
• K. DXA cost of €381.26 (the expected cost based on the 
cost review)
• L. PEUS test cost assumption of €20.00
• M. PEUS test cost assumption of €35.00
• N. Institutionalization costs of €154.00/day (elderly 
home)63
• O. Fracture costs decreased by 25%
• P
. Fracture costs increased by 25%
• Q. No travel costs included (direct health care costs only)
• R. Travel costs doubled
• S. DXA-related travel costs doubled
• T. Mean of sensitivity analysis scenarios B–S.
For the COM vs. POMB comparison, the reported sensi-
tivity analysis scenarios included the following:
• U. Base case
• V
. Mean T-score of −3.5 (severe osteoporosis)
• W
. 30% adherent to FPT at 5 years
• X. No travel costs
• Y. No disutility due to FPT.
Based on the sensitivity analyses, the results were most 
sensitive to the large-scale changes in FPT (initiation propor-
tion, disutility), DXA (cost, traveling), and T-score. 
Y
et, POM 
remained the most cost-effective option and the base case 
analyses were conservative (i.e., did not benefit POM). For 
example, the analyses demonstrated that osteoporosis should 
be detected early and preferably before the first osteoporotic 
fracture, baseline T-score has significant impact on the cost-
effectiveness, FPT should be initiated for osteoporosis and

Osteoporosis management: cost-effectiveness of pulse-echo ultrasound

used persistently, DXA travel has the largest impact regarding 
traveling costs, and any increase in the potentially underesti-
mated DXA-associated costs can significantly decrease the 
cost-effectiveness of COM.
Based on the simulations for different base case testing 
outcomes, the expected additional cost/patient due to the FPT 
assignment being based on the results of a slightly inaccurate 
PEUS was small (€35–61 for POMA, average being €46, 
and €0–22 for POMB, average being €7, over the 10 years; 
varying by risk group) in comparison with the total costs or 
cost savings. Based on a face validity assessment scenario 
with 100% sensitivity–specificity for PEUS, the QALYs were 
similar for COM and POM, and the expected average cost dif-
ference of €165 (average value’s range €162–168 dependent 
on the patient group) in favor of POM was observed (i.e., 
POM would be strongly dominant in the case of similar sen-
sitivity–specificity of PEUS and DXA). On the other hand, 
in an unrealistic extreme sensitivity analysis scenario with 
82% sensitivity–specificity threshold for PEUS, the average 
QALY difference increased with 0.001 between COM and 
POM in comparison to the COM vs. POMA base case, and 
the average cost difference decreased to €91 between COM 
and POM, resulting in €42,604/QALY gained for COM vs. 
POM.
POMA had 96%–100% probabilities for cost-effective-
ness vs. COM at the €24,406 willingness to pay/QALY 
gained and depending on the patients modeled (Figure 3). 
The respective results for POMB were 95%–100%. With

the €36,609 willingness to pay/QALY gained, POMA had 
82%–99% probabilities for cost-effectiveness. The respec-
tive probabilities for POMB were 92%–100%. With the €0 
willingness to pay/QALY gained, POMA and POMB had 
100% and 97%–100% probabilities for cost-effectiveness, 
respectively.
Finally, for descriptive purposes, Table 5 reports the num-
ber of simulated fractures based on the treatment allocation 
and over the maximum time horizon of 10 years (mortality 
included) for a 75-year-old female without any significant 
clinical risk factors and with an average T-score of −2.8. 
Generally, the most frequent fractures include hip and other 
fractures. Given the incidence and unit cost of fractures, the 
highest expected cost impact for the first 3 months after a 
fracture was estimated for hip fractures.
Discussion
Recently, the cost-effectiveness of FPTs has been reviewed,39 
and the cost-effectiveness of osteoporosis testing and FPT 
has been debated.30 This study assessed for the first time 
the incremental cost-effectiveness of two proposed (POMs: 
FRAX→PEUS-when-needed→DXA-when-needed) vs. con-
ventional (COM: FRAX→DXA-when-needed) osteoporosis 
management pathways in Finland using generic alendronate 
FPT for osteoporotic individuals. POMs could result in 
payer cost savings, regardless of whether PEUS is used for 
both osteoporosis testing–diagnosing (POMA) or testing 
only (POMB). POM and the societal perspective appraised 
in countries such as Sweden would result in additional cost 
savings, as most of the indirect costs would be associated 
with the DXA measurement.

The incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of COM vs. 
POMA were high and POMB dominated COM, which indi-
cated that COM would not be cost-effective in comparison 
to POMs in the Finnish setting or in most of the European 
settings. Although COM produced marginally more QALYs 
(0.001) vs. POMA due to false positives and negatives related 
to PEUS use, it was far too expensive to achieve reasonable 
cost-effectiveness. At €24,406 willingness to pay/QALY 
gained, POM had 95%–100% cost-effectiveness probability.
The osteoporosis management costs were reduced when 
PEUS was included. The additional cost due to the FPT 
assignment being based on the PEUS was small in com-
parison with the total costs. The results were sensitive to the 
large-scale changes in the FPT, DXA-associated costs, and 
T-score. However, POMs remained cost-effective vs. COM 
in the extensive sensitivity analyses.
Based on the explorative analyses, osteoporosis should 
be detected early and preferably before osteoporotic fracture, 
T-score has significant impact on the cost-effectiveness, and 
FPT should be initiated for osteoporosis and used persistently. 
If 40,000 women were screened per year and FPT was initi-
ated for the osteoporotic, POMA or POMB could easily result 
in average annual savings of ~€5 or €3 million in the limited 
social and health care budgets, respectively.
However, evaluation with decision analytical modeling 
is a simplification of the complex reality. A typical approach 
is analysis using trial-based efficacy outcomes alone and a 
demonstration that the intervention may work in optimal and 
controlled settings. A more difficult and realistic modeling 
framework was carried out here. As examples, real-world, 
evidence-based health-related quality of life and persistence, 
and conservative sensitivity and specificity thresholds for 
PEUS were used.
Further conservative assumptions were made. For 
example, DXA measurement was assumed to be 100% 
accurate, which may not be true due to various human errors, 
calibration issues or hardware faults. Alendronate FPT was 
assumed to result in disutility. Sensitivity and specificity of 
PEUS were accounted for. A partial consequence of this was 
that especially POMA led to marginally fewer QALYs in 
comparison with COM. However, the average difference was 
only 0.001 QALYs (0.03%), which is a negligible difference.
In a larger scope, the PEUS25–29 just recently received a 
new reimbursement code (0508T: pulse-echo ultrasound bone 
density measurement resulting in indicator of axial bone min-
eral density, tibia) from the American Medical Association.72 
Considering the previously published evidence on the PEUS 
method,25,26,29 the American Medical Association reimburse-
ment,72 and the cost-effectiveness results reported here, the 
use of PEUS as a part of the POM pathway for screening and 
diagnostics in 65- to 80-year-old postmenopausal Caucasian 
women is supported.

In addition, access to DXA can be more expensive than 
assumed here, or even impossible in remote areas. Using an 
affordable cost of DXA based on the current DXA tests and 
potentially underestimated traveling costs, PEUS can easily be 
cost-effective at a cost-per-single-site test of up to around €110 
(i.e., 2.2 times the probably overestimated cost used in the base 
case) in all modeled cohorts. If the costs associated with DXA 
were higher (e.g., if there is a long distance to the nearest DXA 
device), an even higher price per PEUS test could be economi-
cally justifiable. The Finnish results of POMs with PEUS may 
underestimate the savings in other countries, but studies in other 
settings regarding the traveling cost and the optimal location of 
DXA are needed to confirm such a conclusion.
Finally, more flexible and agile, economically justifiable 
methods for screening, detecting, and predicting the course of 
any important or frequent disease or situation are supported 
governmentally by the encompassing digitalization of social 
and health care services as well as by the secondary use of 
health and social welfare data in Finland. More specifically, 
the assessment and implementation of digitalized customer-
responsive health and social care services including, for 
example, Omahoito ja Digitaaliset Arvopalvelut (ODA)  - 
digitalized services for primary health and social care,73,74 
together with the associated Health Village are under their 
way. Moreover, the secondary use data lakes covering social 
and health data have been tested through so-called Isaacus 
pre-production projects,75,76 and the remote use platforms for 
the data lakes together with scientist tools are being built to 
enable knowledge management and research.75 Tools with 
novel data collecting software such as PEUS25–29 are likely 
to fit well to this ongoing development.
Conclusion
A significant unmet need for new, safe, and effective osteo-
porosis diagnosis exists. This cost–utility analysis indicated 
that FPT should be initiated for osteoporotic patients and 
used persistently, and that PEUS is a cost-saving method 
with acceptable results in the osteoporosis testing–diagnosing 
process or the testing process alone, as POMs can result in 
cost savings with very similar health outcomes in comparison 
with COM. POM probably also provides a cost-effective 
alternative for osteoporosis management in other countries 
utilizing DXA measurements, but further studies in other 
settings are needed to confirm this conclusion.
