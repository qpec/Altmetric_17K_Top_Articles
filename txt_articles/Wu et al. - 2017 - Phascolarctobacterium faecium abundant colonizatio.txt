Abstract. Phascolarctobacterium can produce short-chain 
fatty acids, including acetate and propionate, and can be 
associated with the metabolic state and mood of the host. 
The present study investigated the colonization charac-
teristics of Phascolarctobacterium faecium in healthy 
individuals <1-80 years old in Southern China. A total of 
150 fresh fecal samples were collected, and bacterial DNA 
was isolated from these samples for quantitative polymerase 
chain reaction analysis. Phascolarctobacterium faecium 
demonstrated a high colonization rate and abundant coloni-
zation in the human gastrointestinal tract. The colonization 
rate varied between 43.33-93.33%, and the abundance of 
Phascolarctobacterium faecium ranged between 3.22-5.76 log 
cells g-1 (<1 years old) and 3.06-9.33 log cells g-1 (>1 year 
old). The permillage of Phascolarctobacterium faecium in 
total bacteria ranged between 0.004-1.479. There was presence 
of Phascolarctobacterium faecium-like bacteria in younger 
individuals with a gradual increase in the number of bacteria 
maintained at a high level with increasing ages (between 1 
and 60 years old), but with a decrease in elderly individuals 
(>60 years old). The results of the present study demonstrated 
that Phascolarctobacterium faecium is abundantly colonized 
in the human gastrointestinal tract.
Introduction
The human gut microbiota is composed of 400-500 species of 
microbes. However, the molecular classification of operational 
taxonomic units (OTUs) indicate the presence of more than 
1,000 OTUs (OTUs, equivalent to species) in the gut of each 
in different societies, and that the number of OTUs increases 
with age (1,2). The gene pool of the microbial habitants of the 
gut is extremely diverse and considerably larger than the gene 
pool of the host, which determines a number of metabolic 
capacities of the bacteria that are essential for the survival of 
these organisms in the gut (1,3,4).
In recent years, high throughput sequencing technolo-
gies have revealed the correlation between gut microbiota 
and the host. Phascolarctobacterium was found to be a 
substantial acetate/propionate-producer that could be dramati-
cally increased by berberine and metformin. This in turn 
may contribute to the beneficial effects of the two drugs 
on the host (5). Moreover, Phascolarctobacterium was 
found to be positively correlated to the positive mood of the 
human (6). An increasing number of studies proposed that 
Phascolarctobacterium faecium (P. faecium) exerted benefi-
cial effects on the host, including rat model of nonalcoholic 
fatty liver (7).
P. faecium, which utilizes succinate and produces propionate, 
was first purified from koala feces in 1992. P. faecium are 
obligate anaerobic, Gram-negative, non-spore-forming, 
non-motile, asaccharolytic, and belonging to firmicutes (8). 
Although uncultured colonies closely related to P. faecium 
were frequently detected in samples from the human gastro-
intestinal tract, isolation of Phascolarctobacterium from the 
human gastrointestinal tract and the expansion of the culture 
are not yet described in the literature (9), thereby limiting 
the functional studies and clinical applications. In addition, 
the gut microbiota can be affected by aging and diet habit. 
For example, the elderly subjects as compared to the adult 
population show a reduction in the diversity of the microbiota, 
characterized by a considerable interindividual variability, 
with lower numbers of firmicutes (10). The bacterial compo-
sition can also be affected by the diet. Human gut bacterial 
communities like P. faecium are altered by the addition of 
cruciferous vegetables to a regulated fruit- and vegetable-free

diet (11). P. faecium may have undergone a widespread distri-
bution in the human gastrointestinal tract. As the intestinal 
microbiota changes during aging, presumably, the level of 
intestinal P. faecium may be different during the human life. 
Thus, the detection of the presence of this bacterium requires 
an in-depth investigation.
Therefore, we have attempted to isolate P. faecium 
bacteria from human feces and investigated the distribution of 
P. faecium-like bacteria in human feces using real-time PCR 
analysis with species‑specific primers.
Materials and methods
Isolation of strains of P. faecium. Fecal samples were 
freshly collected from healthy Chinese females (age, median 
25 years old) and serially diluted in pre-reduced PBS (0.15 M 
NaCl, 0.15 M sodium phosphate, 0.05 M phosphate-buffered 
saline; pH 7.0) from 10-1 to 10-5g and immediately transferred 
into an anaerobic glove box containing 80% N2, 10% CO2, 
and 10% H2. 100 µl fecal diluents were then inoculated to 
the chocolate plate (Detgerm Microbiology Technology, 
Guangzhou, China) and incubated at 37˚C for 5 days. Single 
pinpoint colonies were selected and regrown on chocolate 
plates. This step was repeated until pure cultures were 
obtained. Finally, two strains have been achieved with pure 
cultures. 16S rDNA from each was PCR amplified using the 
universal primers 27f(59-AGA 
GTT 
TGA 
TCC 
TGG 
CT-39) 
and 1492r(59-GGT 
TAC 
CTT 
GTT 
ACG

T-39) (12). The 
16S rDNA gene sequences of the strains were submitted to 
GenBank, and similar sequences were searched for in the 
public databases using the BLAST algorithm. The sequence 
similarity was analyzed with the EzTaxon-e-server (13). 
MEGA5.0 software was used to construct the phylogenetic 
tree by the neighbor-joining method (14,15).
Fecal sample collection. Fecal samples from healthy infant 
subjects aged <1 year old (n=30), 1-10 years old (n=30), 
10-30 years old (n=30), 30-60 years old (n=30), and 60-80 
years old (n=30), were collected and DNA extracted as 
described below. All the individuals we tested were in 
southern China, who consumed high proportion of carbohy-
drate and a moderate amount of fat, protein and vegetables 
daily in general.
DNA extraction from human fecal samples. Total DNA was 
extracted from the fecal samples by a QIAamp Fast DNA 
Stool Mini kit (Hilden, Germany), following the manufac-
turer's instructions.
Species‑specific primer design. Two specific primers were 
designed from the variable regions of the 16S RNA gene 
sequence of P. faecium. The GenBank program of NCBI 
(BLAST) showed that both the primers were specific to the 
P. faecium. The primers PF1 (5'GGC 
GGC 
TTA 
ATA 
AGT 
CGA 
GC3') and PF2 (5'CGT 
TCG 
CTA 
CCC 
TGG 
CTT 
TC3') ampli-
fied a 200 bp amplicon.
Primers for examining the species specificity. Primers 
were purchased from Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, 
China). The specificity was further confirmed by the DNA 
extracted from different species, comprising four phyla: 
(1) Actinobacteria: 2 species of Propionibacterium, 3 
of Micrococcus and 2 of Nocardia. (2) Bacteroidetes: 
5 Bacteroides, 2 Flavobacterium and 3 Sphingobacterium. 
(3) Firmicutes: 10 Bacillus, 5 Staphylococcus, 
6 Enterococcus, 8 Lactobacillus, 4 Clostridium and 
2 Listeria. (4) Proteobacteria: 2 Neisseriales, 8 Burkholderia, 
10 Salmonella, 1 Pseudomonas. These cultures were provided 
by The Clinical Laboratory Culture Collection of Zhujiang 
Hospital. The DNA extract of the above strains was utilized 
in real‑time PCR. The results did not reveal any amplified 
signal from all these strains. DNA electrophoresis post-PCR 
substantiate the specificity of the primers (Fig. 1).
Real‑time PCR on P. faecium. The real-time PCR standard 
curve of P. faecium was built using SYBR® Select Master 
Mix (#44729, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA), 
following the manufacturer's protocol, in an ABI vii7 
real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems, USA). The DNA 
samples were pre‑denatured at 95˚C for 2 min (first stage) and 
then amplified with 40 cycles at 95˚C for 15 sec, at 58˚C for 
30 sec, at 72˚C for 60 sec, and the final extension at 72˚C for 
5 min. The fluorescent product was detected in the last step 
of each cycle. To distinguish the target PCR product from the 
non-target product, melting curve analysis was performed 
after amplification using the default settings of the ABI soft-
ware from 60 to 95˚C.
The standard curve was created using 10-fold serial dilu-
tions of P. faecium pure culture DNA corresponding to 103 
to 109 cells/reaction, determined microscopically by DAPI 
staining method (16). The bacterial concentration of each 
sample was estimated by comparing the threshold cycle (CT) 
values obtained from the standard curve. All the samples were 
analyzed in triplicate. A linear correlation between the cell 
counts and the CT values (r2=0.998) was observed when the 
number of cells/reaction mixture was between 103 and 109. The 
melting curve analysis of the amplicons obtained by real-time 
PCR generated a distinct peak at 82˚C in the 16S rRNA gene 
of P. faecium.
Statistical analysis. The data were expressed as median 
with interquartile ranges in the parentheses. Man-Whitney U 
test was used to estimate the amount of P. faecium in feces,

whereas the χ2 test was used to analyze the colonization rate 
in various stages of age (P<0.05 was considered to indicate a 
statistically significant difference). All data were analyzed by 
SPSS20.0 software (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY, USA).
Results
Successful isolation of P. faecium from human feces. 
P. faecium was successfully isolated from the human gut. The 
16S rDNA sequence indicated that the strain belonged to the 
originally-isolated strain from koala feces, with 99% simi-
larity. The phylogenetic tree showed that the position of these 
two clinically isolated strains among the selected clones or 
strains belonged to Phascolarctobacterium (Fig. 2).
P. faecium have a high colonization rate in gastrointestinal 
tract. As presented in Fig. 3, a P. faecium colonization 
characteristic analysis was conducted. The colonization 
rate was calculated by the number of P. faecium colonized 
samples/total number of samples in the same age stage. Five 
different age stages presented different colonization rates. 
The highest colonization rate in the five age stages was found 
in individuals aged 30-60 years old (93.33%). Individuals <1 
year old showed the lowest colonization rate (43.33%). The 
colonization rate increased quickly from infant to youth 
(70%), 1-10 years old. Adults aged 10-30 years old exhibited 
a similar colonization rate as compared to the elder group 
(90%). The statistical results by χ2 test were represented in 
Fig. 3C. The colonization rate in infants is significantly low to 
those aged 10-30 years old, 30-60 year-old adults, and elders 
(P<0.01). On the other hand, youth aged 1-10y also exhibits a 
significantly low colonization rate as compared to adults aged 
30-60y (P<0.05) (Fig. 3C).
P. faecium abundantly colonized the gastrointestinal 
tract. The values ranged from 3.22-5.76 log cells g-1and 
3.06-9.33 log cells g-1in samples from infants (age<1y) to 
youth (1y<age<10y). The highest level was presented in 
adults aged between 30-60y, ranging from 3.86-9.03 log 
cells g-1. Adults aged from 10-30y and elders reveal values, 
4.20-9.26 and 3.18-9.37, respectively. Remarkably, the concen-
tration of P. faecium cells in the fecal samples from infants

was significantly less (P<0.01) as compared to the other sample 
groups determined by a Mann-Whitney U test (Table I, Fig. 3A 
and B).
P. faecium‑like bacteria were present at a high level in total 
bacterial population. Total bacteria in samples ranged from 
9.14-10.64 log cells g-1 in the fecal samples (Table I, Fig. 3D). 
The relative abundance of P. faecium in total bacteria (‰) was 
calculated by the amount of P. faecium/ the amount of total 
bacteria*1000. Each sample was calculated separately and their 
means in each group were presented in Table I. The permillage 
of P. faecium in total bacteria ranged from 0.004-1.479. This 
data revealed a high colonization status of P. faecium in the 
gastrointestinal tract (Table I).
Age distribution of P. faecium‑like bacteria. P. faecium-like 
bacteria appeared in early-life and increased in adult stage 
followed by a decrease in the elderly age. According to the 
colonization rate, value, and permillage of total bacteria, 
P. faecium-like bacteria appeared in early-life, increased in 
adult age, and then subsequently decreased in the elder age. This 
was a common bacteria colonized in the gastrointestinal tract.
Discussion
The lumen of the human gastronintestinal tract contains tril-
lions of commensal bacteria, which are difficult to cultivate. 
P. faecium was first purified from koala feces. Since then, 
additional reports of P. faecium have been lacking. We firstly 
isolated some strains of P. faecium from the human gastrointes-
tinal tract. The isolation of the genus of Phascolarctobacterium 
from human feces was a herculean task as a tip-size colony had 
to be harvested from Columbia Blood Agar plate after approxi-
mately one week.
Culture‑dependent techniques, which are a beneficial way 
to elucidate the gut bacterial repertoire, can be used only 
for a limited range of bacteria in the human gut (17). Thus, 
improving the culture-dependent methods for the isolation 
of P. faecium from feces remains a key challenge in micro-
biology.

In the current study, we found that this species not only has 
a high colonization rate but is also abundantly colonized in 
the human gastrointestinal tract. This may suggest its critical 
role in the dynamic balance of the gut microbiota. The colo-
nization rate ranged from 43.33 to 93.33% and the amounts 
ranged from 3.22-5.76 log cells g-1 and 3.06-9.33 log cells g-1, 
according to different age stages. This confirmed that aging 
was a crucial factor for the dynamic balance of the gut flora. 
Age distribution showed that P. faecium-like bacteria were 
present in the early-life, and the number increased rapidly in 
people aged 1-60 years old, the number decreased in elders 
(>60 years old). This phenomenon may be attributed to the 
diet habit. A previous study demonstrated that rats fed with 
high-fat diet appeared to have a higher amount of the short 
chain fatty acid producers, including P. faecium (18). Besides, 
Phascolarctobacterium spp. specialise in the utilisation of 
succinate produced by other bacteria (8). In parallel, the 
abundance of Bacteroides and Parabacteroides, both major 
producers of succinate, increased by high fat diet and was 
positively correlated with body weight (19). The elderly and 
individuals aged less than 1 year consumed relative less fat 
and have a relative low body weight, this may resulted in 
Bacteroides and Parabacteroides decreased, and the availa 
ble 
succinate for P. faecium was decreased. Physical exercise 
was another factor accounting for Phascolarctobacterium 
decrease in the elderly. Rats with a low capacity for running 
that were fed an acute high-fat diet appeared to decrease the 
amount of Phascolarctobacterium and be more susceptible 
to nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (7). Compared with the 
young, the elderly population have less physical exercise, 
which may be another reason for Phascolarctobacterium 
decrease.
Of note, individuals in these two age stages (<1 year and 
>60 years old, respectively) are more susceptible to diges-
tive and metabolic diseases, which are likely linked to the 
less amount of P. faecium. P. faecium-like bacteria are also 
present at a high percentage in total bacteria. The permillage 
of P. faecium in total bacteria ranged from 0.004 to 1.479. In 
addition, P. faecium was firstly isolated from koala, an animal 
fed on poisonous eucalyptus leaves, it may have link with the 
detoxication of gut microbiota. Thus, P. faecium may exert a 
beneficial role in the human gastrointestinal tract. However, 
further investigation is imperative to delve into the functional 
role of these strains in the human gastrointestinal tract.
Herein, we demonstrate, for the first time, the corrobora-
tion and development of a quantitative real-time PCR for the 
detection and quantification of bacteria related to P. faecium. 
Our results demonstrate that P. faecium is present and colo-
nizes the gastrointestinal tract in early-life and develops 
to a high level in healthy adults followed by a decrease in 
elders. Further studies are a prerequisite to exploring the role 
of P. faecium in the microbiota development and its role in 
human health.
