The CRISPR-Cas9 system has raised hopes for developing personalized gene therapies for
complex diseases. Its application for genetic and epigenetic therapies in humans raises
concerns over immunogenicity of the bacterially derived Cas9 protein. Here we detect
antibodies to Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9) in at least 5% of 143 healthy individuals.
We also report pre-existing human CD8+T cell immunity in the majority of healthy indivi-
duals screened. We identify two immunodominant SpCas9 T cell epitopes for HLA-A*02:01
using an enhanced prediction algorithm that incorporates T cell receptor contact residue
hydrophobicity and HLA binding and evaluated them by T cell assays using healthy donor
PBMCs. In a proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate that Cas9 protein can be modified to
eliminate immunodominant epitopes through targeted mutation while preserving its function
and specificity. Our study highlights the problem of pre-existing immunity against CRISPR-
associated nucleases and offers a potential solution to mitigate the T cell immune response.

 T
he Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic
Repeat (CRISPR)-Cas9 technology has raised hopes for
developing personalized gene therapies for complex dis-
eases such as cancer as well as genetic disorders, and is currently
entering clinical trials1,2. The history of gene therapy has included
both impressive success stories and serious immunologic adverse
events3–8. The expression of Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 protein
(SpCas9) in mice has evoked both cellular and humoral immune
responses9,10, which raises concerns regarding its safety and
efficacy as a gene or epi-gene therapy in humans. These pre-
clinical models and host immune reactions to other exogenous
gene delivery systems11–13 suggest that the pathogenic, non-self
origin of Cas9 may be immunogenic in humans.
Both B cell and T cell host responses specific to either the
transgene or the viral components of adenoviral14,15 and adeno-
associated viral (AAV)11,12 vectors have been detected, despite
relatively low immunogenicity of AAV vectors. In the case of
AAV, specific neutralizing antibodies (Abs) and T cells are fre-
quently detected in healthy donors16–19 and specific CD8+T cells
have been shown to expand following gene delivery18. There has
been recent progress in developing strategies to overcome this
problem, such as capsid engineering and transient immunosup-
pression20–22. The potential consequences of immune responses
to expressed proteins from viral vectors or transgenes include
neutralization of the gene product; destruction of the cells
expressing it, leading to loss of therapeutic activity or tissue
destruction; induction of immune memory that prevents re-
administration;
and
fulminant
innate
inflammatory
responses23,24. More potent immune responses to gene therapies
have been observed in humans and non-human primate models
compared to mice8,25.
Of the Cas9 orthologs derived from bacterial species, the
SpCas9 is the best characterized. S. pyogenes is a ubiquitous
pathogen, with an annual incidence of 700 million worldwide26,
but the field is only now beginning to explore potential immunity
to SpCas9 in humans27,28. CRISPR application for human
therapies will span its use both for gene editing (through
DNA double-strand breaks) or epigenetic therapies (without
DNA double-strand breaks). In fact, recent reports shed light
on CRISPR’s ability to activate or repress gene expression in
mice29–31, which opens the door to a variety of new therapeutic
applications such as activating silent genes, compensating for
disrupted genes, cell fate reprogramming, or silencing disrupted
genes, without the concern over permanent change in DNA
sequence. However, unlike the use of Cas9 for gene editing, which
may only require Cas9 presence in cells for a few hours, current
techniques for CRISPR-based epigenetic therapies require longer
term expression of Cas9 in vivo, possibly for weeks and
months30,31, which poses the challenge of combating pre-existing
immune response towards Cas9. This challenge will need to be
addressed before CRISPR application for human therapies,
especially for epigenetic therapies, can be fully implemented.
Delivery of CRISPR in vivo by incorporating its expression cas-
sette in adeno-associated virus (AAV), will most likely shape
many of the initial clinical trials as AAV-based gene delivery is
one of the safest and most prevalent forms of gene therapies in
human. AAV will enable longer term expression of Cas9, desir-
able for epigenetic therapies. Therefore, it is highly likely that
CRISPR delivery through AAV and its expression within target
cells will engage CD8+T cell immunity.
Here, we seek to characterize the pre-existing immune
response to SpCas9 in healthy individuals and to identify the
immunodominant T cell epitopes with the aim of developing
SpCas9 proteins that have diminished capacity to invoke human
adaptive response. We identify two immunodominant SpCas9 T
cell epitopes for HLA-A*02:01 by an improved prediction
algorithm and T cell assays using healthy donor PBMCs. We
demonstrate that Cas9 protein can be modified to eliminate
immunodominant epitopes through targeted mutation while
preserving its function and specificity.
Results
Cas9-specific serum antibodies in healthy controls. We first
determined whether healthy individuals have detectable IgG Abs
to SpCas9. Of 143 healthy control sera screened, 82 (57.3%) had
detectable Abs against S. pyogenes lysate using ELISA (Fig. 1a).
Sera with the highest reactivity to S. pyogenes lysate (n = 80) were
screened for Abs against recombinant SpCas9, of which 7 (8.8%)
were positive (p < 0.0001, two-tailed t-test). At least 5.0% of
healthy individuals screened in this study had Cas9-specific Abs
(Fig. 1a).
Cas9 candidate T cell epitope prediction. Whether Cas9-specific
antibodies impact the efficacy or safety of CRISPR application in
human remains to be seen. However, cellular immunity is
expected to have a more significant impact in case of CRISPR
delivery through viruses. The Cas9 expression cassette, delivered
by a viral vector, leads to intracellular expression of this protein in
target cells, which could evoke a cellular immune response. We
thus focused on investigating the T cell immune response against
SpCas9. We predicted HLA-A*02:01-restricted T cell epitopes
derived from SpCas9 using a model that uses both MHC binding
affinity and biochemical properties of immunogenicity32 (Sup-
plementary Table 1; the top 5 are shown in Fig. 1b). This model
incorporates T cell receptor contact residue hydrophobicity and
HLA binding prediction, which enhances the efficiency of epitope
identification, as we previously reported32. We plotted the cal-
culated normalized binding (Sb) and immunogenicity (Si) scores
for each peptide (Fig. 1c) to predict the more immunogenic
epitopes, which are expected to have both high HLA binding (low
Sb) and more hydrophobicity (high Si). We chose HLA-A*02:01
because it is the most common HLA type in European/North
American Caucasians.
T cell epitope mapping of Cas9. We then investigated whether
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) derived from
healthy individuals had measurable T cell reactivity against the
predicted SpCas9 MHC class I epitopes. We synthesized 38
peptides (Supplementary Table 1) and grouped them into 10
pools of 3–4 peptides each. We measured peptide-specific T cell
immunity using IFN-γ secretion ELISpot assays with PBMCs
derived from 12 healthy individuals (HLA-A*02:01, n = 10; non-
HLA-A*02:01, n = 2) and identified immunoreactive epitopes
within pools 3 or 5 in 83.0% of the donors tested (90% of the
HLA-A*02:01 donors; Fig. 1d). The seven individual peptides
from pools 3 and 5 were evaluated by IFN-γ ELISpot and the
dominant immunogenic epitopes were SpCas9_240–248 and
SpCas9_615-623, designated peptides α and β, from pools 5
and 3, respectively. The subdominant epitopes were found to be γ
and δ from pools 3 and 5, respectively. Both peptides α and β are
located in the REC lobe of the Cas9 protein (Fig. 1e) that binds
the sgRNA and the target DNA heteroduplex33. The individual
peptides within pools that were positive for any donor were
evaluated for this donor by IFN-γ ELISpot. The immunoreactivity
and position of the 38 predicted peptides (a few of which are
overlapping) within the Cas9 protein are shown in Fig. 1e.
Peptides α and β are shown as red dots on the epitope
prediction plot (Fig. 1c) and their sequences and predicted
ranking are shown in Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table 1. As
predicted, these peptides had low Sb and high Si values. Both the

model32. Their ranking as predicted by the consensus method
hosted on the IEDB server using default settings was 14, 5, 18,
and 4, respectively. Sequence similarity of peptides α and β to
amino acid sequences in known proteins was investigated using
Protein BLAST and the IEDB epitope database34. This was done
to investigate whether there is any chance that the T cell immune
response that we are detecting in healthy individuals could be due
to previous exposure to another protein of similar sequence. A
peptide was considered ‘similar’ to α or β if no more than 2 of 9
amino acid residues (that are not the second or ninth) were not
matching (78% similarity). None of these two peptides resembled
known epitopes in the IEDB database, but similarity to other
Cas9 orthologs and other bacterial proteins was detected
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). Epitope β has sequence

Fig. 1 Detection of pre-existing B cell and T cell immune responses to SpCas9 in healthy donors and identification of two immunodominant T cell epitopes.
a Specific serum Abs were detected against S. pyogenes lysate in 57.3% (n = 82) of 143 healthy controls. Sera with the highest reactivity to S. pyogenes
lysate (n = 80, black circles) were screened for Abs against recombinant SpCas9, recombinant EBNA-1 protein (positive control), and human hemoglobin
(negative control), of which 7 (8.8%) were positive for SpCas9 (above the dotted line; *p < 0.0001). b The top 5 predicted SpCas9 T cell epitopes and their
predicted Sb and Si scores and ranking (based on the Sb.Si value)32. These top 5 peptides include the identified immunodominant (α and β; gray) and
subdominant (γ and δ) epitopes that were shown to be immunogenic by IFN-γ ELISpot. c Plot of Sb and Si of predicted HLA-A*02:01 epitopes for the

 similarity to a peptide derived from the Neisseria meningitidis
peptide chain release factor 2 protein (ILEDIVLTL versus
ILEGIVLTL). Antigen-specific T cells were expanded for 18 days
in vitro by coculturing healthy donor PBMCs with peptide
β-pulsed autologous antigen presenting cells (APCs). Cas9-
specific CD8+T cell responses were assessed by flow cytometry.
CD8+T cells specific for the HLA-A*0201/β pentamer were
detected after stimulation (3.09%; Fig. 2a).
Mutated Cas9 proteins have lower immune recognition. We
next hypothesized that mutation of the MHC-binding anchor
residues of the identified immunogenic epitopes would abolish
specific T cell recognition (Fig. 2a). The epitope anchor residues
(2nd and 9th) are not only necessary for peptide binding to the
MHC groove, but are also crucial for recognition by the T cell
receptor32.

decreased to 0.3% when APCs were pulsed with the mutated
peptide (β2; Fig. 2b) compared with 3.09% with the wild type
peptide (β; Fig. 2a). We then examined the reactivity of healthy
donor T cells to modified peptides α or β with mutations
in residues 2, 9, or both (sequences are shown in Fig. 2c) using
IFN-γ ELISpot assay. The epitope-specific T cell reactivity was

 markedly reduced with the mutant peptides (Supplementary
Fig. 1; representative ELISPOT well images are shown in Fig. 2d).
The average reduction for the responsive HLA-A*02:01 donors
was 25-fold from α to α29 (n = 7; p < 0.03) and 30-fold from β to
β29 (n = 8; p < 0.03; Benjamini-Hochberg; Supplementary Fig. 1;
Supplementary Table 4). The predicted binding affinity to MHC
class II was also decreased for α2 and β2 epitopes, although the
experimental significance of this alteration is unknown.
We then generated modified Cas9 constructs by mutating the
second residue of peptide α (L241G; Cas9-α2), peptide β (L616G;
Cas9-β2), or both (Cas9-α2β2). To measure the effect of mutating
the anchor residue of the immunogenic epitopes on T cell
recognition of the Cas9 protein, we transiently transfected healthy
donor B cell APCs with mRNA encoding wild type Cas9 (WT-
Cas9), Cas9-α2, Cas9-β2, or Cas9-α2β2. The T cell response
measured by IFN-γ ELISpot after coculturing of Cas9 transfected
APCs with autologous PBMCs was significantly decreased for the
modified Cas9 proteins (Fig. 2e, f). Introduction of the β2
mutation was the most effective in reducing T cell immunogeni-
city (5.5-fold, p < 0.0001, two-tailed t-test). This mutation in the
REC1 domain (Figs. 1e and 3a) is not located in any of the two
regions that are absolutely essential for DNA cleavage, the repeat-
interacting (97–150) and the anti-repeat-interacting (312–409)
regions33. These results demonstrate that mutating the anchor

 amino acid of a highly immunogenic epitope can influence the
overall immunogenicity of Cas9. Thus, engineering Cas9 variants
with reduced immunogenicity potential can be used in conjunc-
tion with other strategies for safer CRISPR therapies and even
possibly reduce the dosage of systemic immunosuppression
needed for patients.
We therefore tested the function of Cas9-β2 in comparison
with WT-Cas9 in the context of DNA cleavage and transcrip-
tional modulation. To examine the nuclease activity of Cas9-β2
and compare with WT-Cas9, we targeted Cas9-β2 or WT-Cas9 to
an endogenous locus (EMX-1) and measured percent indel
formation (Fig. 3b, c). Our data demonstrate that Cas9-β2 retains
nuclease capacity in the locus we studied as well as on a synthetic
promoter (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. 2A, B).
Next,
we
determined
whether
Cas9-β2
can
successfully
recognize and bind its target DNA leading to transcriptional
modulation. We first tested this in the context of enhanced
transgene expression from a synthetic CRISPR responsive
promoter in HEK293 cells using 14nt gRNAs and aptamer-
mediated recruitment of transcriptional modulators similar to
what we had shown before (Supplementary Fig. 2C, D). Having
shown successful transgene activation, we then investigated
whether this variant retains such capacity within the chromoso-
mal contexts of endogenous genes. We transfected the cells with
plasmids encoding Cas9-β2 or WT-Cas9 and 14nt gRNAs against
two different endogenous genes (TTN and MIAT). qRT-PCR
analysis showed that this variant successfully led to target gene
expression (Fig. 3d–f). To further characterize Cas9-β2 specificity,
we performed genome-wide RNA sequencing after targeting
Cas9-β2 or WT-Cas9 to the MIAT locus for transcriptional
activation. The results demonstrated no significant increase in
undesired off-target activity by Cas9-β2 as compared to WT-Cas9
(Fig. 3g).
To show the extensibility of our approach, we tested the
function of Cas9-α2, that has a mutation located in the REC2
domain (Figs. 1e and 3a). Cas9-α2 also demonstrated DNA
cleavage and transcriptional modulation functionality comparable
with WT-Cas9 (Supplementary Fig. 3A–E). This is consistent
with a previous study which showed that Cas9 with a deleted
REC2 domain retains its nuclease activity33. When T cells were
stimulated with APCs spiked with peptide α2, the percentage of
CD8+CD137+T cells (a marker of T cell activation35) was
decreased by 2.3-fold as compared to WT peptide α stimulation
(Supplementary Fig. 3F).
Immune responses to non-HLA-A*02:01 Cas9 epitopes. We
next predicted T cell epitopes derived from SpCas9 for non-HLA-
A*02:01 alleles using the IEDB analysis tool (Supplementary
Data 1). We selected and synthesized 5–6 epitopes (sequences
shown in Supplementary Table 5 and highlighted in Supplemen-
tary Data 1) for each of 7 common alleles (A*01:01, A*03:01,
A*11:01, A*24:02, B*08:01, B*44:01, B*55:01) and used them to
stimulate PBMCs derived from 6 healthy donors with the corre-
sponding HLA alleles. Of the peptides and alleles screened, we
detected peptide-specific T cell immune responses (in more than
one donor) against peptide 25 in two HLA-A*24:02 donors (p <
0.05; results for HLA-A*24:02 are shown as an example in Fig. 4a).
Immune responses to MHC Class II Cas9 epitopes. We also
predicted MHC class II binding epitopes for the SpCas9 protein
to HLA-DRB1 (10 alleles), HLA-DQ (5 alleles), and HLA-DP (8
alleles) using the IEDB analysis tool (Supplementary Data 2). For
MHC class II, epitope α is predicted to be a top binder to HLA-
DRB1*01:02 and epitope β a top binder to HLA-DPA1*01:03 and
DPB1*02:01
(Supplementary
Data

We
selected
and
synthesized SpCas9 long peptides that include epitopes in the top
2% of predicted MHC class II binders (sequences and alleles
shown in Supplementary Table 6 and highlighted in Supple-
mentary Data 2) and measured peptide-specific CD4+ T cell
immunity using IFN-γ secretion ELISpot assays with CD8-
depleted PBMCs derived from three healthy individuals. We
detected limited CD4+ immune responses against the peptides
tested (Fig. 4b). This prompted us to evaluate the CD4+ T cell
immune response against the whole Cas9 protein compared with
a positive control protein. We stimulated healthy donor CD8-
depleted PBMCs with recombinant SpCas9 or EBNA proteins for
10 days and detected a modest response (less than twofold of that
of unstimulated cells; Fig. 4c). We then sought to investigate
whether the immune response that we detected against peptide β
was primarily derived by CD4+ or CD8+ T lymphocytes. We
stimulated MACS sorted CD4+ or CD8+ T cells isolated from
PBMCs from 3 donors with peptide β and detected a primarily
CD8+ response in all 3 donors (Fig. 4d).
Discussion
The detection of pre-existing B cell and T cell immunity to the
most widely used nuclease ortholog of the CRISPR-Cas9 tool in a
significant proportion of healthy humans confirms previous
studies in mice9,10 and a recent study in humans27 and sheds light
on the need for more studies of the immunological risks of this
system. A recent study reported SpCas9-specific T-cell-mediated
killing of autologous CRISPR-treated APCs in vitro28. However,
the consequences of Cas9-specific immunity in vivo remain to be
seen. The CD8+T cell immunity we observed is likely memory
responses, as they are observed without ex vivo stimulation.
However, following 18 days of T cell stimulation by peptides α or
β, expansion of naïve T cells is not precluded. This suggests that
even in the absence of a pre-existing immune response, the
expression of Cas9 in naïve individuals may trigger a T cell
response that could prevent subsequent administration. This
could be avoided by switching to Cas9 orthologs from other
bacterial species, but can be difficult given the epitope con-
servation across Cas9 proteins from multiple Streptococcus spe-
cies and resemblance to sequences from other bacterial proteins
such as the common pathogen N. meningitidis, that asympto-
matically colonizes the nasopharynx in 10% of the population36.
Therefore, selective deimmunization (immunosilencing) of Cas9
can represent an attractive alternative, particularly in patients
where high-dose systemic immunosuppression is contraindicated,
such as in patients with chronic infectious diseases. This strategy
can be important in particular when longer term expression of
Cas9 will be desired.
Using IFN-γ ELISpot, we detected a modest CD4+ immune
response against recombinant SpCas9 protein and no response to
any of the class II SpCas9 peptides that we used. This is consistent
with a recent study that found the majority of the CD4+ response
against SpCas9 to be restricted to the Treg compartment with
minimum IFN-γ and TNF-α secretion28. While a more com-
prehensive epitope mapping study is needed, we did not experi-
mentally detect immunodominant epitopes among the top
binders of the non-HLA-A*02:01 alleles. We show here that
silencing one epitope for an HLA-A*02:01 donor (who was also
positive for A*11:01, B*39:01, and B*46:01) was sufficient to
significantly reduce Cas9 immunogenicity. However, whether
other mutations need to be introduced to the protein for complete
silencing in HLA-A*02:01 negative individuals needs further
investigation. Conventional methods of deimmunizing non-
human therapeutic proteins rely on trial-and-error mutagenesis
or machine learning and often includes deletion of whole regions
of the protein37–41. Here, as a general principle, we show that

 alteration of one of the anchor residues of an immunodominant
epitope abolished specific T cell recognition. However, HLA
allotype diversity and the existence of numerous epitopes in the
large Cas9 protein may complicate the process of complete
deimmunization. The overall impact of removal of select
immunodominant epitopes remains to be seen; both reduction42
and enhancement43 of the immunogenicity of subdominant
epitopes have been reported with similar approaches for other
proteins.
The top binding T cell epitopes within Cas9 that are most
promiscuous for common HLA class I and class II alleles have
been recently predicted in silico using IEDB44. However, this is
the first study that experimentally validates predicted immuno-
dominant epitopes. None of the HLA-A*02:01 epitopes that we
report overlap with the peptides previously predicted44. This is
not surprising since our prediction model is optimized for HLA-
A*02:01. Thus, improved algorithms are needed to predict epi-
topes that hold up in experimental validation, as we show here.
The use of CRISPR-Cas9 in humans may eventually necessitate
creating HLA type-specific Cas9 variants, particularly for appli-
cations that require long-term Cas9 expression.
Non-specific localized immune suppressive approaches, such
as those used by tumor cells and some viruses may complement
these strategies for complete deimmunization. Antigen pre-
sentation can be blocked by viral proteins interfering with antigen
presentation (VIPRs), such as the adenoviral E319K or US2 and
US11 from the human cytomegalovirus45 or molecules that
inhibit proteasomal antigen processing such as the Epstein-Barr
virus Gly-Ala repeat46. Deimmunized Cas9 may be useful in
reduction of the dosage of other immunomodulatory measures
needed to be co-administered in patients, thus facilitating ther-
apeutic CRISPR applications as we develop better understanding
of the immunological consequences of this system.

 size was determined based on prior experience and similar experiments in the
literature. There was no group allocation and the investigators were blinded to
participants’ information. S. pyogenes lysate was prepared by sonication of bacterial
pellets from overnight cultures of S. pyogenes ATCC 19615 in the presence of 1 pill
of cOmplete Protease Inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) after 3 cycles of freezing and
thawing. Serum antibody detection was performed using ELISA. 96-well plates
were coated with 20 μg/mL of recombinant S. pyogenes Cas9 nuclease (Takara Bio
USA, Mountain View, CA), recombinant Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1
(EBNA; Advanced Biotechnologies Inc., Eldersburg, MD), human hemoglobin
(Sigma-Aldrich) or S. pyogenes lysate. Sera were diluted 1:50 in 10% E. coli lysate
prepared in 5% milk-PBST (0.2% tween)48, incubated with shaking for 2 h at room
temperature, and added to the specified wells in duplicate. Horseradish peroxidase
(HRP) anti-human IgG Abs (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove,
PA) were added at 1:10,000, and detected using Supersignal ELISA Femto Che-
miluminescent substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Luminescence
was detected as relative light units (RLU) on a Glomax 96 Microplate Luminometer
(Promega, Madison, WI) at 425 nm. The cutoff value was defined as any reactivity
higher than the top 99% of RLU values for human hemoglobin (Fig. 1a, dotted
line).
Cas9 candidate T cell epitope prediction. We predicted MHC class I restricted 9-
mer and 10-mer candidate epitopes derived from the Cas9 protein (Uniprot -
Q99ZW2) for HLA A*02:01. The protein reference sequence was entered into 5
different prediction algorithms; 3 MHC-binding: IEDB-consensus binding49,
NetMHCpan binding50, Syfpeithi51, and 2 antigen-processing algorithms: IEDB-
consensus processing, ANN processing52. The individual scores from each of the
prediction algorithms were then normalized within the pool of predicted peptides
after exclusion of poor binders, and the average normalized binding scores were
used to re-rank the candidate peptides. The top 38 candidate peptides (Supple-
mentary Table 1) were selected for experimental testing. The IEDB consensus
MHC-binding prediction algorithm (http://www.iedb.org/) was applied to obtain a
list of high binding Cas9 peptides, each of which was assigned a normalized
binding score (Sb). The immunogenicity score (Si) was calculated for each peptide
based on its amino acid hydrophobicity (ANN-Hydro)32. MHC class II epitopes
were predicted using the recommended setting on IEDB. We used the Visual
Molecular Dynamics software53 (http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) to gen-
erate the Cas9 protein structure (PDB ID: 4CMP, Fig. 3a).
Ex vivo stimulation and epitope mapping of Cas9 by ELISpot. All peripheral
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy individuals with
written informed consent under the Arizona State University institutional review
board and all relevant ethical regulations for work with human participants were
followed. Participants were ethnically diverse. Sample size was determined based
on prior experience and similar experiments in the literature. There was no group
allocation and the investigators were blinded to participants’ information. If
PBMCs from a given donor were not reactive to the positive control, the donor was
excluded from the study. PBMCs were isolated from fresh heparinized blood by
Ficoll–Hypaque (GE Healthcare, UK) density gradient centrifugation and stimu-
lated. Briefly, predicted Cas9 peptides with Sb < 0.148 (n = 38) were synthesized
(>80% purity) by Proimmune, UK. Each peptide was reconstituted at 1 mg/mL in
sterile PBS and pools were created by mixing 3–4 candidate peptides. Sterile
multiscreen ELISpot plates (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) were coated
overnight with 5 μg/well of anti-IFN-γ capture antibody (clone D1K, # 3420-3-250,
Mabtech, USA) diluted in sterile PBS. Frozen PBMCs were thawed rapidly and
recombinant human IL-2 (20 U/mL, R&D Systems) was added. They were then
stimulated in triplicates with 10 μg/mL Cas9 peptide pools (or individual peptides),
pre-mixed CEF pool as a positive control (ProImmune, UK), or DMSO as a
negative control in the anti-IFN-γ-coated ELISpot plates, (Merck Millipore, Bill-
erica, MA, USA) and incubated in a 37 °C, 5% CO2 incubator for 48 h. Plates were
washed three times for 5 min each with ELISpot buffer (PBS+0.5% FBS) and
incubated with 1 μg/mL anti-IFN-γ secondary detection antibody (clone 7-B6-1,
# 3420-6-250, Mabtech, USA) for 2 h at room temperature, washed and incubated
with 1 μg/mL Streptavidin ALP conjugate for 1 h at room temperature. The wells
were washed again with ELISpot buffer and spots were developed by incubating for
8–10 min with detection buffer (33 μL NBT, 16.5 μL BCIP, in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH
9, 1 mM MgCl2, 150 mM NaCl). Plates were left to dry for 2 days and spots were
read using the AID ELISpot reader (Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH, Germany).
The average number of spot forming units for each triplicate was calculated for
each test peptide or peptide pool and subtracted from the background signal.
Autologous APC generation from healthy individual PBMCs. Autologous
CD40L-activated B cell APCs were generated from healthy donors by incubating
whole PBMCs with irradiated (32 Gy) K562-cell line expressing human CD40L
(KCD40L) at a ratio of 4:1 (800,000 PBMCs to 200,000 irradiated KCD40Ls) in
each well. The cells were maintained in B cell media (BCM) consisting of IMDM
(Gibco, USA), 10% heat-inactivated human serum (Gemini Bio Products, CA,
USA), and Antibiotic-Antimycotic (Anti-Anti, Gibco, USA). BCM was supple-
mented with 10 ng/mL recombinant human IL-4 (R&D Systems, MN, USA), 2 μg/
mL Cyclosporin A (Sigma-Aldrich, CA, USA), and insulin transferrin supplement
(ITES, Lonza, MD, USA). APCs were re-stimulated with fresh irradiated KCD40Ls
on days 5 and 10, after washing with PBS and expanding into a whole 24-well plate.
After two weeks, APC purity was assessed by CD19+ CD86+ expressing cells using
flow cytometry, and were used for T cell stimulation after >90% purity. APCs were
either restimulated up to 4 weeks or cryopreserved for re-expansion as necessary.
T cell stimulation by autologous APCs. Antigen-specific T cells were detected by
stimulating healthy donor B cell APCs by either peptide pulsing of specific Cas9
epitopes, or by transfecting with mRNA encoding the whole WT or modified Cas9
proteins. Peptide pulsing of APCs was done under BCM 5% human serum, with
recombinant IL-4. Transfection of APCs was done with primary P3 buffer in a
Lonza 4D Nucleofector and program EO117 (Lonza, MD, USA) and incubated in
BCM-10% human serum and IL-4. Twenty-four hrs later, on day 1, APCs were
washed and incubated with thawed whole PBMCs at a ratio of 1:2 (200,000 APCs:
400,000 PBMCs) in a 24-well plate in BCM supplemented with 20 U/mL recom-
binant human IL-2 (R&D Systems, MN, USA) and 5 ng/mL IL-7 (R&D Systems,
MN, USA). On day 5, partial media exchange was performed by replacing half the
well with fresh BCM and IL-2. On day 10, fresh APCs were peptide pulsed in a new
24-well plate. On day 11, expanded T cells were restimulated with peptide-pulsed
APCs similar to day 1. T cells were used for T cell assays or immunophenotyped
after day 18.
Flow cytometry staining for T cells. Cells were washed once in MACS buffer
(containing PBS, 1% BSA, 0.5 mM EDTA), centrifuged at 550 g for 5 min and re-
suspended in 200 μL MACS buffer. Cells were stained in 100 μL of staining buffer
containing anti-CD137, conjugated with phycoerythrin (PE, clone 4B4-1; BD
Biosciences, USA), anti-CD8-PC5 (clone B9.11; Beckman Coulter 1:100), anti-CD4
(clone SK3; BioLegend, 1:200), anti-CD14 (clone 63D3; BioLegend, 1:200), and
anti-CD19 (clone HIB19; BioLegend,1:200), all conjugated to Fluorescein iso-
thiocyanate (FITC) for exclusion gates, for 30 min on ice. Samples were covered
and incubated for 30 min on ice, washed twice in PBS, and resuspended in 1 mL
PBS prior to analysis.
Pentamer staining for T cell immunophenotyping. The following HLA-A*02:01
PE-conjugated Cas9 pentamers were obtained from ProImmune: F2A-D-CUS-
A*02:01-ILEDIVLTL-Pentamer and 007-Influenza A MP 58-66-GILGFVFTL-
Pentamer. T cells were washed twice in MACS buffer with 5% human serum and
centrifuged at 550 g for 5 min each time. They were then re-suspended in 100 μL
staining buffer (MACS buffer, with 5% human serum and 1 mM Dasatanib
(ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA). Each of the pentamers was added to resus-
pended T cells, stimulated with the respective peptide or APCs at a concentration
of 1:100. Samples were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark, then
washed twice in MACS buffer. Cells were stained in 100 μL MACS buffer with anti-
CD8-PC5, anti-CD4-FITC, anti-CD14-FITC, and anti-CD19-FITC for exclusion
gates, Samples were then washed twice with PBS and analyzed by flow cytometry.
For flow cytometric analysis, all samples were acquired with Attune flow cytometer
(ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) and analyzed using the Attune software.
Gates for expression of different markers and pentamers were determined based on
flow minus one (FMO) samples for each color after doublet discrimination
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Percentages from each of the gated populations were used
for the analysis.
Modified Cas9 plasmids: human codon-optimized Streptococcus pyogenes
Cas9 sequence was amplified from pSpCas9 (pX330; Addgene plasmid ID: 42230),
using forward and reverse primers and inserted within gateway entry vectors using
golden gate reaction. Desired mutations were designed within gBlocks (Integrated
DNA Technologies). The gBlocks and amplicons were then cloned into gateway
entry vectors using golden gate reaction. All the primer sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table 7 and all the gBlocks sequences are listed in Supplementary
Note 1. Next, the Cas9 vectors and CAG promoter cassettes were cloned into an
appropriate gateway destination vector via LR reaction (Invitrogen).
U6-sgRNA-MS2 plasmids: these plasmids were constructed by inserting either
14 bp or 20 bp spacers of gRNAs into sgRNA (MS2) cloning backbone (Addgene
plasmid ID: 61424) at BbsI site. All the gRNA sequences are listed in
Supplementary Table 8.
Cell culture for endogenous target mutation and activation. HEK293FT cell
line was purchased from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s
medium (DMEM - Life Technologies) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS -
Life Technologies), 2 mM glutamine, 1 mM sodium pyruvate (Life Technologies),
and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies) in incubators at 37 °C and 5%
CO2. Polyethylenimine (PEI) was used to transfect HEK293FT cells seeded into 24-
well plates. Transfection complexes were prepared according to manufacturer’s
instructions (Polysciences).
Fluorescent reporter assay for quantifying Cas9 function. For the experiment
assessing Cas9 cleavage capacity at a synthetic promoter, HEK293FT cells were co-
transfected with 200 ng gRNA, 200 ng Cas9 constructs, 50 ng reporter plasmid, and
25 ng enhanced blue florescent protein (EBFP) expressing plasmid as the trans-
fection control. For the experiment assessing Cas9 transcriptional activation

 capacity at a synthetic promoter, HEK293FT cells were co-transfected with 50 ng
gRNA, 70 ng Cas9 constructs, 100 ng MS2-P65-HSF1-GFP (Addgene plasmid ID:
61423), 200 ng reporter plasmid. Fluorescent reporter experiments were performed
48 h after transfection. Nonviable cells were excluded from the analysis using 7-
AAD (7-amino-actinomycin D) conjugated with PerCP. Next, we selected cells
expressing EBFP >2 × 102 A.U. or GFP >2 × 102 A.U. (transfection markers) in the
cleavage and activation experiments, respectively to exclude untransfected cells
(Supplementary Fig. 4). Flow cytometry was performed using a FACSCelesta flow
cytometer (Becton Dickson) with HTS. Flow cytometry data were analyzed using
FlowJo software. Untransfected controls were included in each experiment.
Experiments underwent initial validation in duplicate and then were repeated in
triplicate for the final manuscript.
Quantitative RT-PCR analysis. HEK293FT cells were co-transfected with 10 ng
gRNA, 200 ng Cas9 constructs, 100 ng MS2-P65-HSF1 (Addgene plasmid ID:
61423) and 25 ng EBFP plasmid as the transfection control. Cells were lysed, and
RNA was extracted using RNeasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen) 72 h post transfection,
followed by cDNA synthesis using the High-Capacity RNA-to-cDNA Kit (Thermo
Fisher). qRT-PCR was performed using SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo
Fisher). All analyses were normalized to 18S rRNA (ΔCt) and fold changes were
calculated against untransfected controls (2−ΔΔCt). Primer sequences for qPCR are
listed in Supplementary Table 7.
Endogenous indel analysis. HEK293FT cells were co-transfected with 200 ng of
Cas9 plasmids, 10 ng of gRNA coding cassette, and 25 ng EBFP plasmid as the
transfection control. 72 h later, transfected cells were dissociated and spun down at
200 g for 5 min at room temperature. Genomic DNA was extracted using 50 µl of
QuickExtract DNA extraction solution (Epicentre) according to the manufacturer’s
instructions. Genomic DNA was amplified by PCR using primers flanking the tar-
geted region. Illumina Tru-Seq library was created by ligating partial adapters and a
unique barcode to the DNA samples. Next, a small number of PCR cycles was
performed to complete the partial adapters. Equal amounts of each sample were then
pooled and sequenced on Illumina Tru-Seq platform with 2 × 150 run parameters,
which yielded approximately 80,000 reads per sample. Sequencing was performed
using a 2 × 150 paired-end (PE) configuration by CCIB DNA Core Facility at Mas-
sachusetts General Hospital (Cambridge, MA, USA). The reads were aligned to the
target gene reference in Mus musculus genome using Geneious software, 9-1-5. To
detect the indels (insertions and deletions of nucleic acid sequence at the site of
double-strand break), each mutation was evaluated carefully in order to exclude the
ones that are caused by sequencing error or any off-target mutation. The variant
frequencies (percentage to total) assigned to each read containing indels were sum-
med up. i.e. indel percentage = total number of indel containing reads/ total number
of reads. The minimum number of analyzed reads per sample was 70,000.
RNA sequencing for quantifying activator specificity. HEK293FT cells were co-
transfected with 10 ng gRNA targeting MIAT locus, 200 ng Cas9 constructs, 100 ng
MS2-P65-HSF1 (Addgene plasmid ID: 61423), and 25 ng transfection control.
Total RNA was extracted 72 h post transfection using RNeasy Plus mini kit
(Qiagen) and sent to UCLA TCGB core on dry ice. Ribosomal RNA depletion, and
single read library preparation were performed at UCLA core followed by RNA
sequencing using NextSeq500. Coverage was 14 million reads per sample. FASTQ
files with single-ended 75 bp reads were then aligned to the human GRCh38
reference genome sequence (Ensembl release 90) with STAR54, and uniquely-
mapped read counts (an average of 14.8 million reads per sample) were obtained
with Cufflink55. The read counts for each sample were then normalized for the
library size to CPM (counts per million reads) with edgeR56. Custom R scripts were
then used to generate plots.
