Background-—Although it is well established that heavy alcohol consumption increases the risk of hypertension, the risk
associated with low levels of alcohol intake in men and women is unclear.
Methods and Results-—We searched Medline and Embase for original cohort studies on the association between average alcohol
consumption and incidence of hypertension in people without hypertension. Random-effects meta-analyses and metaregressions
were conducted. Data from 20 articles with 361 254 participants (125 907 men and 235 347 women) and 90 160 incident cases
of hypertension (32 426 men and 57 734 women) were included. In people drinking 1 to 2 drinks/day (12 g of pure ethanol per
drink), incidence of hypertension differed between men and women (relative riskwomen vs men=0.79; 95% confidence interval, 0.67–
0.93). In men, the risk for hypertension in comparison with abstainers was relative risk=1.19 (1.07–1.31; I2=59%), 1.51 (1.30–
1.76), and 1.74 (1.35–2.24) for consumption of 1 to 2, 3 to 4, and 5 or more standard drinks per day, respectively. In women, there
was no increased risk for 1 to 2 drinks/day (relative risk=0.94; 0.88–1.01; I2=73%), and an increased risk for consumption beyond
this level (relative risk=1.42; 1.22–1.66).
Conclusions-—Any alcohol consumption was associated with an increase in the risk for hypertension in men. In women, there was
no risk increase for consumption of 1 to 2 drinks/day and an increased risk for higher consumption levels. We did not find
evidence for a protective effect of alcohol consumption in women, contrary to earlier meta-analyses. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:

ypertension (raised blood pressure [BP], >140 mm Hg
systolic BP, and/or >90 mm Hg diastolic BP) ranks as
the third-most important risk factor for global burden of
disease,1 responsible for considerable and increasing non-
communicable diseases burden and mortality.1,2 This condi-
tion affects more than 1 billion people worldwide with a global
prevalence of close to 20%. Despite decreases in raised BP
mainly in higher income countries, in part attributed to
improved detection and treatment,3 global prevalence of
hypertension has been increasing and is predicted to further
increase in the next decade.1,2 In 2015, hypertension was
responsible for 10.7 (95% confidence interval [CI], 9.6–11.8)
million deaths and 211.8 (95% CI, 192.7–231.1) million
disability-adjusted life years globally.1

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW AND META-ANALYSIS
Downloaded from http://ahajournals.org by on June 2, 2019
 Hypertension is largely a by-product of modern lifestyle
factors such as lack of physical activity,4 unhealthy diet (in
particular, salt intake4), or consumption of alcohol.5 In fact,
some guidelines for clinical management, including those
from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence,
stipulate that all patients undergoing assessment or treat-
ment for hypertension should receive initial and periodic
lifestyle advice, which includes ascertaining their level of
alcohol consumption and encouraging a reduced intake if they
drink hazardously or heavily.6,7 The American Heart Associ-
ation guidelines for the prevention and treatment of high BP
recommend limiting daily alcohol intake to 2 or less drinks for
men and 1 or less drinks for women.8
The relationship between alcohol consumption and hyper-
tension was first reported by Lian9 researching French
soldiers serving in World War II. He found a dose-response
association with a 4-fold increase between drinkers with the
lowest (up to 2 L of wine per day) and highest (>3 L of wine
per day plus aperitifs) levels of consumption. Numerous
studies since then have confirmed the association between
heavy drinking and development of hypertension.10 However,
the association between light-to-moderate drinking and
hypertension is still disputed,11,12 despite a number of
meta-analyses13,14 and countless reviews (overview of recent
reviews15). The association may also depend on sex, which
could be related to differential alcohol metabolism16 or
drinking patterns.17
In part because there have been a number of studies
since the last systematic review including a meta-analysis,14
and in part because the techniques for conducting meta-
analyses have expanded considerably in recent years,18 we
conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the
explicit aim to restricting our review to studies above a
high-quality threshold and to explore potential influencing
factors by stratification by sex and metaregression. This
review intends not only to produce improved sex-specific
estimates for comparative risk assessments within the
Global Burden of Disease studies19 and for the Global
Status Reports of the World Health Organization,20 but also
provide much needed evidence for hypertension-specific
drinking guidelines.
Methods
All data are from publicly available sources.
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
Following the meta-analysis of observational studies in
epidemiology checklist,21 we conducted a systematic elec-
tronic literature search using Medline and Embase from
inception to April 3, 2017 for keywords and MeSH terms
relating to alcohol consumption, hypertension, and observa-
tional studies (Table S1). Additionally, we searched reference
lists of identified articles and published meta-analyses and
reviews. Inclusion criteria were as follows:
1. Full-text article with original cohort data (including nested
case-control studies) examining the association between
total alcohol consumption and incidence of hypertension.
2. Participants with hypertension at baseline were excluded.
3. Analyses were adjusted or matched for age at baseline.
4. Incidence for at least 2 quantitatively defined categories of
average alcohol consumption in addition to nondrinkers, or
incidence for former drinkers in relation to lifetime
abstainers were reported.
5. Results were sex specific.
For a continuous nonlinear dose-response meta-analysis,
results for at least 3 drinking groups in addition to
nondrinkers had to be reported. We did not apply language
restrictions. Authors were contacted for clarification and
missing data. Two reviewers independently excluded articles
based on title and abstract or full text, and abstracted the
data. Any discrepancies were resolved in consultation with a
third reviewer.
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
• This is the first meta-analysis based on high-quality cohort
studies on the relationship between different levels of
alcohol consumption and risk for incident hypertension.
• We investigated the risk for hypertension separately for men
and women in people who did not have hypertension at
baseline.
• The risk for hypertension in former drinkers was similar to
that of lifetime abstainers.
• We found that, compared with nondrinkers, the risk for
hypertension was increased at all levels of alcohol con-
sumption in men. Contrary to earlier meta-analyses, we did
not find a protective effect of low levels of alcohol
consumption in women.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
• The findings support sex-specific drinking guidelines with
regard to risk for hypertension. These guidelines may be
revised to indicate the increased risk for any alcohol
consumption in men.
• Alcohol consumption should be assessed at the primary
care level whenever there is elevated blood pressure.
• Changing clinical practice promises to reduce substantial
mortality and burden of disease associated with both
alcohol consumption and hypertension.

 Data Extraction
From all relevant articles, we extracted authors’ names, year of
publication, country, calendar year(s) of baseline examination,
follow-up period, setting of the study, assessment of hyperten-
sion status, age (mean or median) at baseline, sex, number of
observed incident hypertension cases among participants by
drinking group, number of total participants by drinking group,
specific adjustment or stratification for potential confounders,
and adjusted measures of effect (relative risks [RRs], odds
ratios, and hazard ratios) and their confidence intervals or
standard errors. Risk estimates by sex and race/ethnicity were
treated as independent samples. As a result, multiple articles
and estimates from the same study22–24 were included, but
each case of incident hypertension was used only once in each
of the analyses conducted. If necessary, effect sizes within
studies were recalculated to contrast alcohol consumption
categories against nondrinkers.25 Because incidence of hyper-
tension was not rare, we transformed odds ratios to RRs based
on the formula described by Zhang and Yu.26 Hazard ratios and
RRs were treated as equivalent measures of risk.
Exposure and Outcome Assessment
Consolidating exposure measures across primary studies
involved a 2-step process. First, among drinkers, we con-
verted reported alcohol intake categories in primary studies
into an average of pure alcohol in g/d using the midpoints
(mean or median) of reported drinking group categories. For
open-ended categories, we added three quarters of the
second-highest category’s range to the lower limit of the
open-ended category of alcohol intake if the mean was not
reported. Standard drinks vary by country, with 1 standard
drink containing �8 to 14 g of pure alcohol.27 We used
reported conversion factors when standard drinks were the
unit of measurement to convert all measures to g/d. Then, for
reporting of our analyses, we considered categories with a
mean of up to 12 g of pure ethanol as 1 standard drink for a
global representation. Qualitative descriptions, such as “so-
cial” or “frequent” drinkers with no clear total alcohol intake
in g/d, were excluded.
Because of the changing definitions of hypertension over
time, we defined hypertension status at baseline and incident
cases of hypertension as defined in the primary studies
(typically assessed as taking antihypertensive medications or
as mean systolic BP at baseline >140 mm Hg).
Quality Assessment
Most quality
scores are tailored for meta-analyses of
randomized trials of interventions,28–30 and many criteria do
not apply to epidemiological studies examined in this study.
Additionally, quality score use in meta-analyses remains
controversial.31–33 As a result, study quality was incorporated
by including quality components, such as study design,
measurement of alcohol consumption and hypertension,
adjustment for age, and sex-specific RRs, in the inclusion
and exclusion criteria and further by investigating potential
heterogeneity in metaregression models and several subgroup
analyses. We used the most adjusted RR reported and the
most comprehensive data available for each analysis, and
gave priority to estimates where lifetime abstainers were used
as the risk reference group.
In a formal risk of bias analysis, we used the Cochrane risk
of bias tool for nonrandomized studies (ROBINS-I)34 to assess
risk of bias in primary studies. We rated the evidence for the
association between alcohol consumption and incidence of
hypertension based on the Grades of Recommendation,
Assessment, Development and Evaluation system.35
Statistical Analyses
In analyses using standard drinks as the exposure measure,
RRs were pooled with inverse-variance weighting using
DerSimonian-Laird
random-effect
models
to
allow
for
between-study heterogeneity.36 Small-study bias was exam-
ined using Egger’s regression-based test.37 Variation in the
effect size because of heterogeneity between-studies was
quantified using the I2 statistic.38 Between-study heterogene-
ity was investigated with random-effects metaregressions.39
Using studies that reported data for 4 or more alcohol
intake groups, we conducted 2-stage restricted cubic spline
regression in multivariate metaregression models taking into
account the variance-covariance matrix for risk estimates
derived from 1 reference group40,41 to calculate continuous
nonlinear dose-response curves for total alcohol consumption
(g/d) in relation to abstainers. All meta-analytical analyses
were conducted on the natural log scale of the RRs (and
hazard ratios) in Stata statistical software version 14.2 (Stata
LP, College Station, TX).
Results
Literature Search and Study Characteristics
Of 3771 identified references, 465 were reviewed in full text.
In total, data from 20 reports from 18 studies were used in
the analysis (Figure 1). Nine reports were from the United
States,22–24,42–47 4 from Japan,48–51 2 from China,52,53 and 1
each from Germany,54 South Korea,55 Finland,56 Turkey,57
and Thailand58 (Table). Several reports from the Nurses’
Health Study42,44–46 were included, but any 1 case of incident
hypertension was included only once in any particular
analysis. Overall, data from 361 254 participants (125 907

 men and 235 347 women) and 90 160 incident cases of
hypertension (32 426 men and 57 734 women) were ana-
lyzed. Mean age at baseline among men ranged from 25 to
57 years
with
a
weighted
mean
of
47.1 years
(me-
dian=50 years), with mean follow-up duration of 5.3 years
(median=4; range, 3.9–20.0). In women, mean age ranged
from 25 to 60 years with a weighted mean of 46.7 years
(median=54), with mean follow-up duration of 7.3 years
(median=4; range, 3.9–20.0). Most studies were well adjusted
for potential confounders; 1 study was adjusted only for
age.55
Meta-Analyses
The pooled RR among former drinkers22,24,50,53,58 in compar-
ison with lifetime abstainers was 1.03 (95% CI, 0.89–1.20),
with virtually no differences between men and women
(Figure S1). Any alcohol consumption increased the risk for
hypertension compared with abstainers in men (Figure 2 and
Figure S2). In women, there was no observed risk increase for
consumption of 1 or 2 drinks/day in comparison with
abstainers, and an increased risk beyond this level with a
pooled RR=1.42 (95% CI, 1.22–1.66; I2=88%) for consumption
of 3 or more drinks per day (Figure 3 and Figure S3). Because
we included 2 studies from the Nurses’ Health Study42,45 with
different follow-up periods of the same participants, we ran a
sensitivity analysis including only 1.42 The results compared
to Figure 3 were almost identical (1–2 drinks/day: pooled
RR=0.95; 95% CI, 0.88–1.03). Different adjustment for
potential confounders in regression models in primary studies
resulted in little changes in RRs for different levels of alcohol
consumption. In men, data for alcohol consumption beyond
75 g/d were only available from Asian countries (Figure 4).
There were no data for women consuming more than 75 g/d
(Figure 5). Two studies53,55 were judged to be of serious risk
of bias, 1 of low risk, and 16 of moderate risk of bias mainly
because of the observational study design and 1-time
measurement of alcohol consumption (Table S2). Thirteen
studies used clinical measurements of BP to determine
incidence of hypertension.22–24,48–57 Similar relationships
were found when we excluded studies with potential serious
risk of bias and that relied on self-reported incidence of
hypertension (Figures S4 and S5).
Heterogeneity
was
high
in
most
analyses,
and
we
conducted metaregressions to investigate potential sources
of heterogeneity in drinkers of 1 to 2 drinks/day. The
difference between men and women was statistically signif-
icant (RRwomen vs men=0.79; 95% CI, 0.67–0.95; P=0.012;
proportion of heterogeneity explained: 69%). There was no
significant difference between studies from Asian and non-
Asian countries in men (RRnon-Asian vs Asian=0.93; 95% CI,
0.71–1.21; P=0.55) or women (RRnon-Asian vs Asian=0.92; 95%
CI, 0.76–1.11; P=0.33). Three studies from the United States
presented results stratified by race (black versus white). In
men, people of white origin had nominally higher risk for
incidence of hypertension compared with people of black
origin (RRBlack
vs
White=0.63; 95% CI, 0.08–4.93; P=0.44),
whereas in women the opposite was observed (RRBlack vs
White=1.31; 95% CI, 0.66–2.63; P=0.38). However, the number
of incident hypertension cases was low and CIs were wide,
indicating low statistical power to detect significant differ-
ences. Three studies presented results by age groups.46,49,51

 at a time revealed no meaningful differences in effects
(Figures S8 and S9).
Given the observational nature of the studies included, we
rated the evidence for a causal effect of high alcohol
consumption (3 or more drinks/day) on incidence of hyper-
tension as moderate. However, evidence from randomized
controlled trials59 support a causal effect with higher
confidence.
Regarding
alcohol
consumption
of
1
to
2 drinks/day, our findings indicate effect modification by
sex and no protective association. Evidence from randomized
controlled trials for this level of alcohol consumption is limited
and thus we judge the quality of the evidence as moderate.
Discussion
In high-quality cohort studies, we found that the association
between average alcohol consumption of 1 to 2 drinks/day
and risk of hypertension was modified by sex, with men
showing an increased risk, whereas women showed no
different risk compared with abstainers. Alcohol intake
beyond
2 drinks/day
was
consistently
associated
with
increased incidence of hypertension in both men and women.
Before discussing these results and their implications, we
would like to point out some limitations. Conclusions of every
meta-analysis are determined by the quality of the original

 studies. This meta-analysis is based on cohort studies, and
thus this study type does not allow conclusions about
causality.60 However, as indicated above, analogue dose-
response relationships for alcohol reduction on reduction
of BP and hypertension based on trial data point to a
causal effect of level of alcohol consumption on risk of
hypertension,59 and this reasoning is corroborated by plau-
sible biological pathways.10 Second, all alcohol assessments
were based on subjective measurements, which may entail
bias.61 However, most reviews come to the conclusion that
subjective measurement of alcohol is reliable,62 even though
there is some bias of underestimating true consumption, for
example, sales data show higher consumption compared to
survey data.61,63 Thus, although the overall dose-response
relationship would not be affected, there may be some
misestimation of the RRs of the levels of drinking (eg, previous
work64). Finally, although patterns of drinking, in particular
irregular heavy drinking occasions, have been shown to
impact on BP and risk of hypertension,65 we could not find
enough cohort studies meeting our inclusion criteria to
quantify this effect by meta-analysis.
Despite these limitations, the results are consistent in
showing a dose-response relationship between level of
consumption and risk of hypertension based on observational
data, corroborated by randomized controlled trials. For men,
there seems to be no lower threshold, whereas for women,
the dose-response seems to emerge only beyond 2 drinks a
day. For both sexes, no protective effect could be found (and
was not expected given the biological pathways10). What
could explain the differences between men and women? One
explanation could be the difference in heavy drinking occa-
sions within an overall average intake of alcohol of less than 2
drinks. An average of 2 drinks/day could be achieved by
actually drinking 2 drinks every day, or by drinking 7 drinks
each on Saturday and Sunday. The latter has different effects
on blood pressure66 and thus on risk of hypertension. Further
research (both observational and experimental) is necessary,
however, to ascertain the effects of pattern of drinking
(including peak blood alcohol level) on hypertension and thus
the repeated plea to include more measures on patterns of
drinking into all epidemiological work.67,68
Implications
Clinicians are faced with a dilemma. On the one side, low-level
drinking has been associated with less risk for ischemic heart
disease69,70; on the other side, the risk for hypertension seems
increased, at least in men. In order to side with caution,
patients should be advised to drink as little as possible for
many reasons, including increased risk of cancer and injury, to
name a few,15 and the risk of hypertension should be added to
the list of diseases where no alcohol consumption is safe. This
may require a change in drinking advice in current guidelines
for prevention and treatment of hypertension, which state that
men should limit their alcohol intake to 2 drinks or less, a level
which we found to be associated with increased risk for
hypertension. Additional research with stronger, more-experi-
mental study design may help in answering outstanding
questions on cardiovascular risk from low levels of drinking.
Other implications of this research are clear: Alcohol
consumption should be assessed at the primary care level
whenever there is elevated BP.71 Unfortunately, despite some
guidelines recommending such an approach, it is rarely
followed in clinical practice (for the example of the 6 largest
European Union countries72). Efforts should be made to change

both preventable and reversible,10,59 and there are effective
and cost-effective interventions to reduce alcohol consumption
level in primary care.73,74 Changing clinical practice promises
to reduce substantial mortality and burden of disease associ-
ated with both alcohol consumption and hypertension.10,75
