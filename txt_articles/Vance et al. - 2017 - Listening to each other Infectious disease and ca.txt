Abstract
The immune system provides defense against tumors and pathogens. Here, we propose that by 
elucidating the shared principles of immunity that underlie cancer and infectious disease, 
oncologists and microbiologists can learn from each other and achieve the deeper mechanistic 
understanding critical the development of therapeutic approaches.
INTRODUCTION
From their earliest days, the fields of microbiology and immunology have been inextricably 
linked. Collaborations between microbiologists, immunologists, and infectious disease 
specialists led to vaccines that have saved millions of lives by virtually or entirely 
eliminating many of humankind’s major scourges, including diphtheria, polio, and smallpox. 
Although certain infectious diseases have resisted vaccine development, such as malaria, 
tuberculosis (TB), and AIDS, vaccines remain among the most effective measures to combat 
infectious disease.
In contrast to infectious diseases, which have been severely curtailed in the developed world, 
cancer remains a major cause of morbidity in both the developed and developing world. 
Unlike microbiology and immunology, the fields of infectious diseases and cancer have not

 been extensively linked, although there are a few exceptions. For example, up to 20% of 
cancers are caused by infectious agents, including Helicobacter pylori, Kaposi’s sarcoma-
associated herpesvirus (KSHV), hepatitis C virus, and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) (1). 
Indeed, studies of RSV were instrumental to the discovery of oncogenes (2). Although the 
importance of the immune system in combating infectious disease is indisputable, for many 
years there was controversy on the role of the immune system in naturally combating cancer 
and on whether it would be possible to exploit the immune system to treat cancer. With the 
recent successes of cancer immunotherapy, however, it is clear that therapeutic and 
prophylactic manipulations of the immune system are key approaches to treating and/or 
preventing both infectious diseases and cancer.
Here, we ask how the study of infectious diseases has and may continue to influence cancer 
immunotherapy, and likewise, we ask how the success of cancer immunotherapy might 
reciprocally lead to approaches with which to attack infectious diseases that have remained 
intractable to vaccine development (Fig. 1).
Do similar immunological principles apply to infections and tumors?
Our understanding of the immune response has largely been derived from studies of 
infections and model antigens. It is therefore reasonable to ask to what extent this 
understanding applies to the immune response to tumors. The diversity of both infectious 
agents and cancers makes generalizations difficult. Indeed, the principles of immunity 
derived from one infectious agent do not necessarily apply even to another infectious agent, 
let alone a tumor. Nevertheless, we propose that there exist shared immunological 
mechanisms that underlie infectious diseases and cancer pathologies, and thus, cross-
fertilization of ideas between these fields has been and will likely continue to be fruitful.
One important principle of immunity is that immune responses are usually initiated upon 
detection of conserved microbe-specific molecules called pathogen-associated molecular 
patterns (PAMPs) that are recognized by germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors 
(PRRs) (3). PAMPs are expected to be absent from tumors, which are (with a few exceptions 
mentioned below) self-derived, implying that the PAMP concept might not have relevance to 
cancer immunology. However, not all PAMPs are microbe-specific. For example, double-
stranded DNA (dsDNA), found in all cells, is a PAMP that is recognized by at least three 
distinct PRRs (TLR9, AIM2, and cGAS). The ability of the innate immune system to 
distinguish self from foreign dsDNA relies on detecting dsDNA of different origins in 
distinct subcellular compartments (4). Self dsDNA is generally nuclear, whereas TLR9 
recognizes (foreign) dsDNA in endosomes, and AIM2 and cGAS recognize cytosolic 
dsDNA. It is plausible that the cell death and genomic instability that occur in tumors might 
lead to aberrant localization of DNA. Indeed, there is growing evidence that the cGAS-
mediated dsDNA detection pathway plays a role in initiation of immune responses to tumors 
[(5); discussed below]. In addition, despite the centrality of PAMPs to innate immunity, it 
has long been appreciated that non-PAMP-based mechanisms can also initiate immune 
responses. These mechanisms are diverse but are unified by the common idea that 
disruptions of normal cellular physiology can be detected by the immune system (6–8). For 
example, natural killer (NK) cells recognize cells that have aberrantly downregulated

 expression of MHC class I (9), a characteristic often exhibited by both transformed and viral 
ly infected cells. The DNA damage response, often activated in transformed cells and 
precancerous lesions, is also now appreciated to stimulate a diverse set of immune responses 
(10). Thus, it is likely that diverse innate immune mechanisms that evolved primarily to 
defend against infections might also have utility in detecting tumors.
Another hallmark of immunity is self/non-self discrimination, a principle that is most clearly 
exemplified by the specific recognition of pathogen-encoded epitopes by the antigen 
receptors of B and T lymphocytes. It is not immediately obvious that this central concept 
would apply to tumors, because again, tumors are essentially “self” cells. Indeed, although 
immune responses can be raised against arbitrary non-natural chemical structures, it is 
generally understood that the immune system evolved in large part to recognize “non-self” 
in the form of pathogenic microbes. However, numerous recent cancer exome sequencing 
projects have revealed that tumors can carry a large spectrum of mutated proteins that can be 
detected as non-self (11). In addition, there is evidence that unmutated self proteins can also 
be the subject of “autoimmune” recognition in the context of cancer (12).
Self/non-self discrimination is not the only immunological concept with relevance to both 
infectious disease and cancer: Phagocytosis, cell death, cell-cell communication, cell 
migration, cell extravasation, development of immune microenvironments, and immune 
evasion and suppression are all immunological processes with direct relevance to cancer 
(13). However, the most prominent immunological process relevant to infections and tumors 
is almost certainly inflammation, a complex constellation of physiological states that arises 
during immune responses. Inflammation, as is often pointed out, is a double-edged sword, 
with obvious benefits but also important negative consequences for the host. During acute 
infections, inflammation is critical to recruit anti-microbial immune cells to the site of 
infection. This results in tissue destruction, but ideally, the damage is localized. Systemic 
effects of inflammation, such as fever, are also ideally transient. Indeed, a key component of 
the inflammatory cascade is the initiation of pro-resolution tissue repair and healing 
responses (14). Thus, when it functions well during an acute response, inflammation can 
eliminate infections and tumors and restore homeostasis. Problems arise when inflammation 
does not resolve appropriately or is inappropriately regulated; this scenario is relevant to 
both chronic infections and cancer. It is now well-appreciated that chronic inflammation is 
an important cause of cellular damage, enhanced cellular proliferation, angiogenesis, and 
immunosuppression that can promote tumorigenesis (1, 13). Indeed, the chronic 
inflammation associated with certain persistent infections, for example, those caused by H. 
pylori or human papilloma virus (HPV), is believed to be an important cause of the gastric 
and cervical cancers associated with these agents. In addition to causing cancer, 
inflammation also appears to contribute to the morbidity and mortality of cancer. The multi-
organ dysfunction and systemic metabolic pathology, such as cachexia (wasting), which 
ultimately underlie many cancer deaths, likely arise at least in part due to chronic 
inflammation (15). Interestingly, similar physiological effects are observed in chronic 
infectious diseases such as AIDS or TB. Indeed, an interesting way to think of cancer is as a 
chronic infectious disease—the consequence of the unresolved presence and growth of a 
“foreign” body. For example, many concepts relevant to the treatment of chronic infections, 
including multi-drug resistance, are also relevant to the treatment of tumors. The close

 conceptual similarity between chronic infections and cancers is underlined most 
dramatically by several examples of cancers that are literally infectious agents, for example, 
the transmissible tumors of Tasmanian devils (16) and bivalves (17).
How have studies of infection led to cancer immunotherapies?
Given the close conceptual similarities between infections and cancer, it is interesting to 
reflect on how infection studies have affected approaches for immunotherapy of cancer ever 
since William Coley pioneered the notion in the late 19th century. Bacille Calmette–Guérin 
(BCG), injected intravesically, was the first effective immunotherapy for cancer. BCG was 
shown to be effective in treating high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer in 1976 and is 
still standard care for this disease (18). Animal studies suggest that BCG injections mobilize 
CD4 and CD8 T cells as well as NK cells against tumors (19).
Checkpoint immunotherapies also owe a major debt to infection studies. Although the 
concept of CTLA-4 blockade arose from studies of T cell costimulation (20), the role of 
PD-1 in T cell exhaustion emerged most directly in studies of T cell dysfunction in chronic 
viral infections in mice (21). Evidence emerged from those studies that blockade of the PD-1 
interaction with its ligand PD-L1 restored the activity of exhausted CD8 T cells and reduced 
viral loads, vitalizing efforts to apply PD-1 blockade for immunotherapy of cancer.
Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) therapy, which has proven successful against 
hematological malignancies, was first conceived in a proof-of-principle format, with a test 
antigen, trinitrophenyl, as a target (22). However, the first attempt to engineer disease-
specific T cells involved targeting HIV-infected cells and not cancer (23). In fact, targeting 
pathogen infections with CAR T cells remains a very active field of research (24).
An obvious area of overlap of infectious disease and cancer immunology is in the design and 
application of vaccines. Most vaccines for infectious disease agents are prophylactic (for 
example, healthy people are vaccinated to prevent infections), whereas most efforts in cancer 
immunology are therapeutic (patients are treated after diagnosis). To date, prophylactic 
vaccines to prevent cancer are limited to instances where tumors are caused by pathogens, 
and the vaccine targets the pathogen. Important examples are the HPV and hepatitis B virus 
vaccines, which strongly reduce the risk of cervical cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma, 
respectively (25, 26). Prophylactic vaccines against cancers that are not pathogen-induced 
remain an ambitious goal (27). On the other hand, therapeutic vaccination for cancer is an 
area of intense investigation (28). Therapeutic vaccination is unlikely to be effective for most 
acute infections due to the rapidity of pathogen growth but has been applied for rabies and 
may be a valuable future approach for other chronic or slowly developing infections (29).
The basis of most, if not all, successful infectious disease vaccines is the induction of 
antibodies that effectively neutralize microbes or their toxins. Indeed, the first Nobel Prize 
was awarded to Emil von Behring for his discovery that diphtheria anti-toxin prevented 
disease. Since the emergence of antibiotics and vaccines, passive serotherapy is no longer 
commonly applied in infectious disease. In contrast, anti-tumor monoclonal (for example, 
rituximab) and bispecific (such as catumaxomab) antibodies are used clinically for cancer 
with variable success (30). However, many current immunotherapy approaches seek to

 stimulate another arm of the immune system, cell-mediated immunity, which involves 
cytolytic lymphocytes that are able to recognize and kill tumor cells. Cancer vaccines have 
typically used tumor antigens mixed with antigen-presenting cells and adjuvant costimuli to 
amplify the immunogenicity of the antigen-presenting cells. Such cancer vaccines, for 
example Provenge, have so far been modestly successful. Vaccines targeting T cell responses 
may be limited in potency because the antigen-presenting cells are not adequately activated 
and are therefore not sufficiently immunostimulatory. Platforms to drive stronger CD8 T cell 
responses are therefore of great interest. Interestingly, many of the important infectious 
diseases for which we have failed to develop protective vaccines (such as, AIDS, TB, and 
malaria) are caused by intracellular pathogens (31), and successful immune responses to 
intracellular pathogens also generally involve cell-mediated immunity. Thus, strategies to 
enhance cell-mediated immunity are likely of interest to the fields of both immuno-oncology 
and infectious disease. New types of attenuated vaccine platforms have been developed 
based on the understanding of the infectious life cycle of intracellular pathogens such as 
Listeria monocytogenes (32) or viruses of various categories (33). These vaccines deliver 
antigens to the cytoplasm of infected cells and provide adjuvant effects as well as sustained 
availability of the target antigen and antigens for T cell help, all conducive to generating 
strong CD8 T cell responses. Such vaccine strains may be especially useful for emerging 
cancer vaccines that are based on the post-diagnosis identification of “neoantigens” specific 
to a patient’s tumor (11), followed by generation and application of vaccines to amplify 
tumor-specific T cells against those antigens.
Therapeutic targeting of PRRs represents another very important bridge from infection 
studies to cancer therapies. PAMPs that engage Toll-like receptors (TLR), including CpG 
and poly(I:C) (double-stranded RNA), have been tested in clinical trials (34), and one such 
drug that activates TLR7, imiquimod, is approved for treating superficial basal cell 
carcinomas (35). Combining such ligands with vaccines or conventional therapies is also 
being extensively investigated.
A new PRR-based approach with great promise for cancer immunotherapy has emerged 
from the findings that bacteria secrete immune-stimulating cyclic dinucleotides (CDNs), 
consisting of cyclized dimers of guanosine and/or adenosine nucleotides. Bacterial CDNs 
are potent inducers of type I interferon (IFN) responses by immune cells (36–38). A key 
finding was that CDNs bind and activate the endoplasmic reticulum–membrane resident 
signaling protein STING (39), which is also essential for the IFN response of cells that 
accumulate intracytoplasmic DNA (40). Mammalian cells contain a cytoplasmic enzyme, 
cGAS, which is activated by cytoplasmic DNA to synthesize a specific CDN isoform called 
cGAMP (41). The STING-cGAS pathway is now known to be necessary for protective 
responses against certain viruses (42). A role for this pathway in immune-oncology emerged 
when it was found that the STING pathway is essential for strong anti-tumor immune 
responses against transferred tumors (43). With respect to therapy, CDNs, injected directly 
into tumors, stimulate potent immunemediated anti-tumor responses, expansions of 
cytotoxic T cells, and tumor regressions (43). Activity against distant metastases was also 
observed. Based on these promising findings, CDNs are now entering clinical trials in 
multiple types of cancer.

 How might the success of cancer immunotherapy be applied to infectious disease?
The success of cancer immunotherapy is leading to new insights and renewed efforts to 
enhance and modulate the immune system’s activity toward infectious diseases. For 
example, “checkpoint” therapies that block inhibitory immunoreceptors are being advanced 
in chronic infections to overcome T cell exhaustion. PD-1 blockade in the SIV macaque 
model demonstrated rapid expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells with improved functional 
quality, leading to reduced viral loads and prolonged survival (44). Blocking of PD-1 in a 
chimpanzee HCV model similarly showed an ability to restore anti-viral CD4 and CD8 T 
cell responses and control of viral replication (45). The importance of PD-1 as well as other 
co-inhibitory receptors, such as CTLA-4, TIM-3, and LAG-3, has been confirmed in 
multiple viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (46), suggesting broader application of this 
approach to managing infections.
The emphasis on innate immune stimulation, generating cytotoxic T cell responses, and 
identifying effective T cell antigens for cancer immunotherapies are destined, in turn, to give 
infectious disease vaccinology a boost. Computational and “-omics” approaches to identify 
and validate immunostimulatory antigens and epitopes are critical for both cancer and 
infectious disease vaccine design (47, 48). Applications of these approaches to infectious 
disease challenges, such as creating a universal vaccine for influenza, have shown promising 
results (49). Adjuvants that promote cellular immunity will be essential for targeting 
intracellular pathogens and viral infections. Studies applying STING pathway agonists as 
adjuvants or therapies in a variety of infections are underway (50). Vector systems that 
selectively elicit strong CD8 T cell responses such as L. monocytogenes, as well as 
poxviruses and adenoviruses, are seeing application in infections such as HIV, hepatitis C, 
TB, malaria, and leishmaniasis (51). Exciting approaches to enhancing NK cell responses, 
which target both cancers and infectious diseases, are emerging (52). As with vaccine 
technology, advances in CAR T cell therapy for hematological malignancies may lead to 
applications in infectious diseases. Methods for receptor design and delivery have advanced 
rapidly (53) and are being reapplied to CAR T cell therapies for HIV and other chronic 
infections (24).
CONCLUSION: FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES
Despite many notable therapeutic successes, infectious diseases and cancer remain as major 
causes of global morbidity and mortality. A better understanding of how the immune system 
successfully responds to pathogens may lead to the design and implementation of strategies 
to elicit similar responses to tumors. Conversely, therapeutic approaches proven to work in 
the context of cancer may have application to infectious diseases, particularly chronic 
infections and/or those caused by intracellular pathogens. Thus, we suspect that immuno-
oncologists and infectious disease immunologists still have a lot to learn from each other 
(Table 1).

 Fig. 1. Shared immunological principles, responses, and potential therapies for infectious disease 
and cancer
Although cancers and infections exhibit considerable diversity and encompass many unique 
aspects, the figure emphasizes how shared immunological principles, responses, and 
therapies potentially play important roles in both types of disease.

Questions for further thought
There are still numerous outstanding questions to be addressed to better understand the similarities and 
differences between immune responses to infections and tumors.
Questions for further thought
• What innate immune pathways are important for immune recognition of tumors?
• In what respects is the immune response to a tumor similar to the immune response to a chronic infection?
• Why are therapeutic vaccines rarely used to treat infections? Given this, why is it believed that they may be useful in treating cancer?
• Can prophylactic vaccines be developed for cancer?
• Could passive monoclonal or bispecific antibody therapies used to treat cancer also be applied to infections?
• Can checkpoint blockade provide an effective therapeutic strategy for infections?
• How can cytotoxic T cell responses best be elicited in a vaccine? Would such vaccines be of benefit for immunization against tumors and 
intracellular pathogens for which we currently lack effective vaccines?
