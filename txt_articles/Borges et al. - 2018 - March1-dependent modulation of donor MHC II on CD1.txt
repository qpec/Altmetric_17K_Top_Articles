In transplantation, donor dendritic cells (do-DCs) initiate the alloimmune response either by
direct interaction with host T cells or by transferring intact donor MHC to host DCs. How-
ever, how do-DCs can be targeted for improving allograft survival is still unclear. Here we
show CD103+ DCs are the major do-DC subset involved in the acute rejection of murine skin
transplants. In the absence of CD103+ do-DCs, less donor MHC-II is carried to host lymph
nodes, fewer allogenic T cells are primed and allograft survival is prolonged. Incubation of
skin grafts with the anti-inflammatory mycobacterial protein DnaK reduces donor MHC-II on
CD103+DCs and prolongs graft survival. This effect is mediated through IL-10-induced
March1, which ubiquitinates and decreases MHC-II levels. Importantly, in vitro pre-treatment
of human DCs with DnaK reduces their ability to prime alloreactive T cells. Our findings
demonstrate a novel therapeutic approach to dampen alloimmunity by targeting donor MHC-
II on CD103+DCs.

endritic cells (DCs) initiate adaptive immune responses
by delivering the prerequisite signals for specific T cell
activation. DCs present peptides in MHC class II (MHC
II) and I cell surface complexes and, when activated, provide
costimulatory signaling (i.e., CD86) and cytokines that modulate
the type of T cell response that ensues1–3. The activation of CD4+
T cells upon interaction with MHC II-peptide complexes on DCs
is the key event in generating protective immune responses to
infection, as well as detrimental autoimmune, allergic, and
alloreactive responses. In alloimmune responses, draining lymph
nodes (dLN) serve as the optimal site to prime anti-donor T cells
by donor DCs carrying and transferring donor intact MHC
molecules to host DCs via extracellular vesicles4. Mouse skin
contains three major subsets of APCs including two dermal and
one epidermal subset. Dermal DCs (DDCs) include CD103+ DCs
(also known as cDCs1) and CD11b+ DCs (or cDCs2)5, while
Langerhan’s cells (LCs) are in the epidermis. Although LCs share
some characteristics of DC lineage, they are currently classified as
macrophages6,7. Migratory DCs can also be found in the
LN along with resident DC subsets, which include CD8a+ and
CD8a− DCs. In human skin, CD141+ and CD1c+ DDCs are the
counterparts of murine CD103+ and CD11b+ DDCs, respec-
tively5. However, in skin transplantation, the specific donor DC
subsets, migrating to dLN and transferring donor MHC antigens
to host DCs have not been determined.
Current strategies to prevent graft rejection are largely based
on the use of drugs that inhibit non-specific T cell activation and
proliferation8, while more recent strategies have also targeted
costimulatory molecules9. These therapies have been undoubtedly
useful for better clinical results, however the overall outcome of
such approaches directed at undesired T cell responses is chal-
lenged by off-target side effects. We hypothesized that a strategy
to target donor DCs, through the modulation of donor MHC
antigens, constitutes an important complementary therapeutic
approach. However, to achieve this goal, it is first crucial to
identify the leading donor DC subsets responsible for the allor-
eactive priming.
Tolerogenic DCs have been characterized by the low expres-
sion of MHC and costimulatory molecules. As previously
reported by our group and others, DnaK, the bacterial ortholog of
murine heat shock protein (Hsp)a1a gene product (Hsp70), can
modulate MHC II expression and IL-10 production on DCs10,11.
It also has anti-inflammatory effects in models of autoimmunity,
like arthritis12,13. Furthermore, membrane-associated RING-CH
1 (March1) is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates a con-
served lysine residue in the cytoplasmic tail of the MHC II-β
chain14,15. Induction of March1 is driven by interleukin IL-1016
and leads to ubiquitination of MHC II and CD86, resulting in
lysosomal degradation and decreased surface expression of these
proteins17. Whether targeting March1 could promote tolerogenic
DCs and prolong graft survival has not been tested.
In the present study, we have identified that skin-migrating
CD103+ DCs are the major DC subset carrying donor MHC
molecules. These cells have a critical role in shuttling donor MHC
to the allograft dLNs and transferring donor MHC to host DCs,
which is required for an efficient priming of donor-reactive
T cells. In addition, Batf3−/− skins (lacking CD103+ DCs) are
less immunogenic and carry less allo-MHC II in the transplanted
tissue. We next determined whether downregulation of donor
MHC II expression within this DC subset could extend graft
survival. The in situ treatment of donor skin grafts with DnaK
prior to transplant induces IL-10 and decreases donor MHC II
levels in CD103+ DCs, reducing alloreactive T cell priming and
extending graft survival. We newly identify that DnaK is a strong
inducer of March1. IL-10 induced by DnaK activates March1-
mediated ubiquitination of MHC II and its subsequent MHC II
degradation. In human DCs, DnaK also induces MARCH1 and
downregulates HLA-DR (MHC II) levels in CD141+, but not
CD1c+ DCs. We therefore propose that targeting donor CD103+/
CD141+ DCs prior to transplant constitutes a novel approach to
reduce immunogenicity of the transplanted allograft upon
transplantation.
Results
CD103+ DCs is the major DC subset carrying donor MHC II.
To determine which DC subset was carrying donor MHC anti-
gens in dLN, we transplanted C57Bl/6 (B6, H-2Kb/I-Ab) skins
into BALB/c (H-2Kd/I-Ad) hosts and tracked donor MHC II
(I-Ab) in host dLN using flow cytometry. We found that MHC II
(I-Ab) was present in dLN from 3 h to day 7 post-transplant
(Fig. 1a). Importantly, we could not detect those antigens when
BALB/c skins were transplanted into BALB/c hosts (both H-2Kd/
I-Ad) (Fig. 1b) or when we transplanted MHC II−/− skins (B6
background) into BALB/c hosts (Supplementary Fig. 1a), ensur-
ing the specificity of our detection. In very early time-points
(3–12 h
post-transplant)
around
15–20%
of
I-Ab+
events
expressed the DC marker CD11c, while from day 1 to 7 post-
transplant, majority of the donor-derived MHC II was present in
a CD11c+ population (Fig. 1c). We then analyzed the phenotype
of DCs carrying donor MHC II molecules (I-Ab+CD11c+ cells).
Remarkably, the majority (~65%) of the I-Ab+ DCs had the
CD103+CD11b− phenotype (Fig. 1d; Supplementary Fig. 2a) in
all time-points analyzed. Absolute total numbers confirmed
CD103+ DCs as the major DC subset carrying I-Ab (Fig. 1e), with
these cells peaking at 6 h post-transplant. To address whether
donor CD103+ DCs were important contributors of transferring
donor antigens to host DCs, we tracked donor I-Ab in very early
time-points (3 h, 6 h and 12 h) post-transplantation, before they
die and cross-dress host DCs. We found that at 3 and 6 h post-
transplant ~60% of CD103+ DCs carrying I-Ab did not express
host MHC I (H-2Kd) when reached dLN (Fig. 1f). However, at 24
h after the transplant, 100% of I-Ab+ cells were also H-2Kd+,
suggesting that they were cross-dressed (Fig. 1f). Further detailed
characterization
revealed
that
I-Ab+
DCs
possessed
a
CD11c+CD207+CD11b−CD103+
phenotype
(Supplementary
Fig. 2b), confirming that they were skin migratory cells. Lastly, we
validated that CD103+ DCs were the major subset carrying donor
MHC II using a different tracking model, in which we trans-
planted skins from CD45.1 (H-2Kb/I-Ab) mice into CD45.2
BALB/c (H-2Kd/I-Ad) hosts (Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4).
Batf3−/− grafts carry less donor MHCII and are less immu-
nogenic. The CD103+ DC subset requires the transcription factor
Batf3 for their development in mice18. To confirm the role of
donor CD103+ DCs in transporting donor MHC II to dLN, we
transplanted skin grafts from Batf3−/− donors, which lack
CD103+ DCs, into BALB/c hosts (intact host CD103+ DCs).
Host DCs cross-dressed with allo-MHC II were absent in dLN of
mice that received Batf3−/− allografts, 24 h after the transplant
(Fig. 2a). We also observed a reduced percentage of total I-Ab+
cells in dLN of Batf3−/− graft recipients (Fig. 2b), supporting that
CD103+ DCs is the dominant donor cell subset transferring
donor MHC II molecules. Accordingly, mice that received Batf3
−/− skins presented increased allograft survival compared to WT
skins, with an MST of 17.5 days compared with 9 days, respec-
tively (n = 10 per group; p < 0.001) (Fig. 2c, d). Analysis of dLNs
revealed a significant reduction in the numbers of proliferating
(Ki67+) CD8+ T cells (Fig. 2e) and CD8+ T effector memory
cells (TEM—CD8+CD44+CD62L− cells; Fig. 2f). To test whether
allogeneic T cells were efficiently primed in the absence of
CD103+ DCs, we isolated dLN T cells from fully-MHC

 mismatched transplant recipients that had received either a WT
or Batf3−/− skins 96 h before. Those cells were exposed by direct
allorecognition to irradiated allogeneic (B6) or syngeneic (BALB/
c) splenic stimulator cells. The production of IFN-γ by dLN
T cells was tested by enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT).
When T cells isolated from mice that received Batf3−/− allografts
were cultured with allogeneic stimulators, they produced sig-
nificantly less IFN-γ compared to WT allografts (Fig. 2g). These
data suggest that donor CD103+ DCs have a critical role in
priming donor-specific host T cells.

 We next assessed the possibility that Batf3−/− skins contain
less alloantigens, since they lack the main DC subset carrying
I-Ab antigens. We quantified the numbers of I-Ab+ cells in WT or
Batf3−/− naive skins, as well as WT or Batf3−/− skin allografts,
24 h after transplantation. WT skin allografts presented signifi-
cantly less I-Ab+ cells when compared to WT naive skin (Fig. 2h),
suggesting that I-Ab-carrying cells were emigrating from the skin
or dying quickly after transplantation, as previously reported19.
Interestingly, Batf3−/− naive skin carried remarkably less I-Ab+
cells (~85% reduction) when compared to WT naive skin
(Fig. 2h). The same was true when we compared Batf3−/− skin
grafts to WT grafts (Fig. 2h), revealing that less donor MHC II
remained in the transplanted tissue.
We then hypothesized that allograft-derived Batf3−/− skin cells
might be less immunogenic than WT skin cells. To test that, dLN
T cells isolated from transplanted mice (day 4 post-transplant)
were cultured with irradiated skin cells derived from WT or
Batf3−/− allografts, and IFN-γ production was analyzed by
ELISPOT. We isolated skin stimulator cells from 24 h trans-
planted allografts when most of donor migratory cells were
gone19,20. When we re-stimulated the WT or Batf3−/−-primed
T cells with WT skin graft cells, we found less IFN-γ production
in mice that received Batf3−/− skins compared to WT (Fig. 2i).
Furthermore, when we cultured WT-primed T cells with WT or
Batf3−/− skin allograft cells, we found that Batf3−/− skin showed
inferior allostimulatory capacity (Fig. 2i). T cells primed with
Batf3−/− allografts and re-stimulated with Batf3−/− skins
presented the lowest production of IFN-γ, indicating that donor
CD103+ DCs are required in both priming and recall of
alloreactive T cells. In summary, the lack of CD103+ DCs in
the donor skin leads to less priming of alloreactive T cells in the
dLN; and when these T cells migrate to the skin, they will also
encounter less donor MHC II, which may weaken the rejection
process. Overall, Batf3-deficient skins have less allo-MHC II skin
tissues leading to reduced priming of allo-T cells on dLN and
prolongation of allograft survival in the absence of systemic
immunosuppressive treatment.
DnaK treatment targets CD103+ DCs and impairs alloimmu-
nity. Next, we explored if the modulation of donor-derived MHC
molecules could be a potential way to attenuate alloimmunity. A
potential candidate was DnaK from M. tuberculosis, since it had
previously shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory molecule that
modulates MHC II molecule expression on DCs11,13. Therefore,
we performed a fully MHC-mismatched skin transplant, with an
in situ treatment of donor skin prior to the transplant. We
immersed B6 (H-2Kb/I-Ab) donor tissues in a solution containing
DnaK and transplanted the skins into BALB/c (H-2Kd/I-Ad)
hosts (Fig. 3a). DnaK treatment decreased the expression of
donor MHC II (I-Ab, Fig. 3b) and CD86 (Fig. 3c) of cross-dressed
host CD103+ DCs in dLN, both on day 1 and 4 post-transplant.
In addition, CD103+ DCs within dLNs of DnaK-treated allografts
produced more IL-10 than non-treated controls (Fig. 3d).
Migration of donor DCs was not affected by DnaK treatment
(Supplementary Fig. 5).
Consistent with our previous observation21, DnaK-treated
donor skins presented significantly prolonged survival without
any additional treatment (Fig. 3e). DnaK-treated grafts had a
median survival time (MST) of 20 days compared to 14 days for
the control group (n = 23 per group; p < 0.0001). We obtained
similar results in a different MHC mismatch context, in which
donor C3H skin grafts (H-2Kk/I-Ak) were incubated with DnaK
and transplanted to BALB/c (H-2Kd/I-Ad) hosts (Supplementary
Fig. 6). This prolongation of graft survival with DnaK is
significant for a stringent model as skin transplantation in which
interventions such as anti-CD8 depletion22 and immunosuppres-
sion with CTLA-4-Ig23 were incapable of prolonging graft
survival. DnaK treatment of donor skins also significantly
decreased the absolute numbers of proliferating CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells (Fig. 3f), and CD4+ and CD8+ TEM cells (Fig. 3g).
We next isolated dLN T cells isolated from DnaK-treated
animals or controls, exposed them to irradiated allogeneic (B6)
splenocytes and evaluated IFN-γ production by ELISPOT.
Decreased numbers of IFN-γ–producing T cells were detected
in animals that received DnaK-treated allografts (Fig. 3h). We
observed no changes in response to third-party stimulators in
the DnaK-treated group compared with controls (Fig. 3h),
suggesting that DnaK reduced the priming of donor-specific
T cells. DnaK did not affect the indirect allorecognition pathway,
because B6 DCs from hosts that received DnaK-treated BALB/c
skin transplants could present the Eα52–68 peptide (BALB/c-
derived)
in
I-Ab
context24
in
similar
way
than
controls
(Supplementary Fig. 7). In sum, DnaK treatment of donor skins
reduces the expression of donor MHC II on host cross-dressed
CD103+ DCs, decreasing the priming of anti-donor T cells and
improving graft survival with no additional therapy.
DnaK induces March1-dependent MHC II surface down-
regulation. Next, we sought to address the molecular mechan-
isms by which DnaK induces the downregulation of MHC II and
CD86 in DCs. MHC II expression can be regulated by tran-
scriptional and post-translational mechanisms. While transcrip-
tion of MHC II is regulated by the MHC class II transactivator
(CIITA), membrane-associated RING-CH 1 (March1) can ubi-
quitinate MHC II, leading to internalization and downregulation

 molecules that have been reported to modulate DC activity and
inhibit allograft rejection, such as cyclosporin A (CsA)25,26 and
rapamycin (RAPA)27. Because IL-10 is known to induce
March116, IL-10 was used as positive control. DnaK and
recombinant murine IL-10 treatments, but not CsA or RAPA, led
to a significant induction of March1 mRNA levels in murine DCs
(Fig. 4b). To assess whether ubiquitination targets MHC II
towards late lysosomal vesicles, we analyzed the localization of
MHC
and
late
endosomes/lysosomes
marker
lysosomal-
associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP-1) in DCs treated with
DnaK using confocal microscopy. In DnaK-treated DCs, MHC II
was internalized and co-localized with LAMP-1 in intracellular
vesicles, while untreated DCs showed MHC II on the cell surface
and LAMP-1 distributed intracellularly with minimal overlap
with MHC II (Fig. 4c). In addition, ubiquitination of MHC II was
increased in DCs treated in vitro with DnaK when compared to
untreated DCs (Fig. 4d). Since CD86 expression levels can also be
regulated by March128, we next assessed MHC II and CD86
expression by flow cytometry and found that DnaK was able to
downregulate MHC II (Fig. 4e, f) and CD86 (Fig. 4g, h) expres-
sion in WT DCs, but not in March1−/− cells, indicating
that March1 is required for DnaK-induced downregulation of
MHC II and CD86. DnaK treatment could decrease MHC II and
CD86 levels only in the CD103+ DCs (Fig. 4g), but not in
CD11b+ DCs (Fig. 4h) sorted from skin-dLNs. Also, March1 was
induced only in CD103+, but not in CD11b+ DCs (Fig. 4i) upon
DnaK stimulation, demonstrating its specific effect on this
DC subset.

 March1 is induced via ERK/STAT3/IL-10 pathway. We further
investigated the mechanisms underlying DnaK-mediated induc-
tion of March1 and downregulation of MHC II levels in DCs. We
previously demonstrated that DnaK could modulate DC prop-
erties in a pathway involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3
(STAT3)29. To better characterize this signaling pathway, we
treated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with DnaK
for 15, 30, and 45 min and then analyzed the expression of p-Akt
(pS473), p-STAT6 (pY641), p-ERK1/2 (pT202/pY204), and p-
STAT3 (pY705) by flow cytometry. We did not observe any
change in p-Akt (Fig. 5a, lane 1) and p-STAT6 (Fig. 5a, lane 2)

 upon DnaK treatment. However, DnaK increased p-ERK1/2
levels at 15 min post-stimulation (Fig. 5a, lane 3), and p-STAT3 at
45 min (Fig. 5a, lane 4). To test whether these two molecules were
required for DnaK-induced March1 expression, we utilized MEK
inhibitor—PD9805930 to inhibit ERK and a specific p-STAT3
inhibitor—BP-1-10231.
March1
expression
was
completely
inhibited in PD98059- (Fig. 5b) and BP-1-102-treated DCs
(Fig. 5d). In addition, both molecular pathways were required for
MHC II downregulation (Fig. 5c, e) in DnaK-treated DCs, sug-
gesting ERK-STAT3 axis plays a role in upregulation of March1.
IL-10 is a major anti-inflammatory cytokine that down-
regulates
MHC
II
expression32
through
the induction
of
March116. In addition, DnaK has been shown to increase IL-10
production by BMDCs and macrophages11,33, and its anti-
inflammatory effects depend on this cytokine34,35. We tested
whether induction of IL-10 by DnaK was the basis for March1
induction and MHC II downregulation. We treated DCs isolated
from WT or Il10−/− mice with DnaK in vitro and analyzed
March1 expression. We observed that Il10−/− DCs treated with
DnaK did not undergo upregulation of March1 compared to WT
DCs (Fig. 5f). The addition of recombinant murine IL-10 partially
restored
March1
expression
(Fig.
5f).
Furthermore,
IL-10
expression in these cells was required for DnaK-induced down-
regulation of MHC II (Fig. 5g). These findings are consistent with
the observed loss of DnaK-mediated graft protection in Il10−/−
skin grafts (H-2Kb/I-Ab) transplanted in BALB/c hosts (Fig. 5h).
We concluded that March1 induction by DnaK requires the ERK-
STAT3-IL-10 molecular pathway.
DnaK impairs alloimmunity through March1. Given the DnaK-
induced March1 expression and MHC II downregulation in DCs
in vitro, we evaluated the involvement of March1 in DnaK-
mediated attenuation of alloimmune responses in vivo. We
treated WT or March1−/− skin grafts (H-2Kb/I-Ab) with DnaK,
transplanted them in BALB/c hosts and analyzed I-Ab-expressing
CD103+ DCs, as shown in Fig. 6. In March1−/− CD103+I-Ab+
DCs from dLNs, the expression levels of MHC II or CD86 were
unchanged with DnaK treatment (Fig. 6a–c), both on day 1 and 4
post-transplant,
compared
to
WT
cells.
Importantly,
the
improvement in allograft survival induced by in situ treatment
with DnaK was dependent on March1 expression by donor skins
(Fig. 6d). In accordance, we observed a significant reduction in
absolute numbers of proliferating (Ki67+) CD4+ and CD8+
T cells (Fig. 6e) in hosts that received DnaK-treated allografts.
This reduction was completely abolished when donor skins were
March1-deficient (Fig. 6e). Consistent with reduced allosensiti-
zation, mice that received DnaK-treated allografts showed a
March1-dependent reduction in absolute numbers of CD8+ and
CD4+ TEM cells (Fig. 6f). All T cells were from host origin
(Supplementary Fig. 8). We next tested whether the decrease in
the DCs allostimulatory capacity induced by DnaK was March1-
dependent. We treated WT or March1−/− BMDCs with DnaK,
cultured them with allo-T cells and evaluated T cells IFN-γ
production by ELISPOT. DnaK decreased the capacity of WT, but
not March1−/−, BMDCs to induce IFN-γ production by allo-T
cells (Fig. 6g). These results indicated that in situ DnaK treatment
downregulates donor MHC II and CD86 surface levels through
March1 both in vitro and in vivo. Also, March1 induction by
DnaK was essential for decreased alloreactivity to skin trans-
plants, modulation of T cell activation and improvement in
allograft survival.
To assess the contribution of donor MHC II to graft rejection
and T cell responses in our model, we isolated dLN T cells from
animals that received fully-mismatched WT or MHC II−/− skins
grafts, cultured them with allogeneic (B6) stimulator (direct
allorecognition), syngeneic (BALB/c) or third-party (C3H—H-
2Kk/I-Ak) cells and analyzed IFN-γ production by ELISPOT.
T cells from animals that received MHC II−/− grafts produced
less IFN-γ when cultured with allogeneic splenocytes (Supple-
mentary Fig. 9a). The same did not happen when T cells were
cultured with third-party stimulators. When incubated in vitro
with MHC II−/− allogeneic stimulators, we also observed less
IFN-γ by T cells from BALB/c mice transplanted with WT
B6 skins (Supplementary Fig. 9b). These data suggest that skin
transplant is generating donor MHC II-specific T cell responses.
Overall, DnaK reduces donor MHC II expression on CD103+
DCs via March1, impairing alloreactivity to skin allografts.
DnaK decreases allo-stimulatory capacity of human DCs. We
next asked whether the modulation of MHC II expression via
DnaK-induced March1 would also occur in human cells. Thus,
we investigated DnaK-mediated MHC II downregulation using
human peripheral monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), as
well as human skin-derived DCs. First, Mo-DCs were differ-
entiated from five healthy volunteers, and were cultured in the
presence of DnaK for 24 h. DnaK-treated Mo-DCs had lower
HLA-DR (MHC II) surface expression levels (Fig. 7a), higher
MARCH1 and IL-10 mRNA levels (Fig. 7b). Similarly, when
treated with DnaK for 24 h, human skin-derived primary
DCs showed lower HLA-DR surface expression levels only in
CD1c−CD141+
population,
which
corresponds
to
mouse
CD103+ DCs, but not in CD1c+CD141− DCs (Fig. 7c; Supple-
mentary Fig. 10). MARCH1 and IL-10 mRNA levels were also
increased in skin cells (Fig. 7d). Furthermore, to functionally
assess the modulation of allo-stimulatory capacity of DnaK-
treated DCs, human BMDCs were co-cultured with third party
peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and IFN-γ pro-
duction was measured by ELISPOT. Human BMDCs pre-treated
with DnaK-induced significantly less allo-T cell IFN-γ production
compared to those cultured with non-treated BMDCs (Fig. 7e). In
accordance, in mixed lymphocyte reaction, DnaK-pre-treated
BMDCs provoked less proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells
compared with those co-cultured with non-treated BMDCs
(Fig. 7f). Overall, our findings suggest that DnaK-mediated
downregulation of MHC II surface expression in DCs can inhibit
human alloimmune responses in vitro.
Discussion
The contribution of each skin DC subset to initiate alloimmune
responses is still being elucidated. While donor LCs are not

 required for the complete rejection of MHC-mismatched skin
allografts36, Celli et al.20 demonstrated by intravital microscopy
that dermal DCs rapidly migrated from the skin to host dLNs20.
However, the specific dermal DC subsets were not distinguished
in that study. We found that donor-derived CD103+ was the
major DC subset carrying donor MHC to dLNs. The importance
of this subset is reinforced by the fact that skins lacking the
CD103+ DCs (Batf3−/−) had better graft survival with reduced
donor MHC II expression in the dLN and allografts, and less
primed T cells. Recently, donor CD103+ DCs were shown to have
a major role in amplifying the pathology of graft-versus-host
disease37. Batf3-dependent DCs were also proposed to have a role
in rejection of minor mismatched grafts38. Our data highlights
that donor CD103+ DCs is the dominant cell source transferring
donor MHC II molecules to dLN, either by direct migration in
early time-points or by cross-dressing of host DCs. However, the
precise contribution of each of these scenarios in the priming of
allo-T cells needs to be further explored. This is the first report to
demonstrate the key role of donor Batf3-dependent DCs in
initiating acute rejection of a fully MHC-mismatched graft model,
identifying this subset of DCs as the major source of donor MHC
II, and a potential target to modulate the alloimmune response.
While direct and indirect allorecognition have been tradition-
ally considered the primary mechanisms of DC activation of allo-
specific T cells, the importance of semi-direct allorecognition is
being increasingly recognized4,39,40. The shuttle of donor MHC
antigens through extracellular vesicles has been shown to
dominate early allorecognition compared to direct contact of
donor DC with host T cells, since only few donor DCs were
identified in dLN at 24 h after transplantation4,40. The extra-
cellular vesicles are uptaken and incorporated onto host DC cell
membranes (cross-dressing), and these host DCs then activate
alloreactive T cells4,40. The source of donor-derived vesicles still
need to be investigated, since most of I-Ab+ events are CD11c−
from 3 to 12 h post-transplant (Fig. 1c). Nonetheless, we could
detect in very early time-points (3–12 h) after transplant that a
high percentage (~40–60%) of donor MHC II+ cells did not
express host MHC, and therefore were donor DCs. This dis-
crepancy between studies seems to be primarily related to the
timing of analyses (3–12 h vs. 24 h), indicating that in our model
donor DCs and donor-derived vesicles are reaching the dLN and
cross-dressing host DCs at later time-points (24 h)19. From these
host cross-dressed DCs, most of cells carrying I-Ab were also
CD103+ DCs in very early time-points. It is possible that CD103
molecules expressed on membrane of donor cells are transferred
and incorporated on membrane of DCs from a different origin,
like CD103−CD11b− DCs41,42. Another possibility is that the
origin of the extracellular vesicles would dictate the cell type in
which these vesicles will be incorporated. Also, CD103+ DCs
might produce more extracellular vesicles and have a superior
capacity to cross-dress host DCs compared to other subsets,
characterizing this subset as the main provider of donor MHC II
during skin transplantation. However, these possibilities need to
be further tested. Overall, direct and semi-direct allorecognition

 are important early after transplant with the latter becoming
dominant as migratory CD103+ donor DCs are killed by host
cells19. Identification and targeting of specific graft-derived cell
subsets to decrease the load of donor MHC may allow for
effective immune modulation to be achieved with lower immu-
nosuppressant
dosage,
thereby
decreasing
side-effects
and
toxicity.
The expression of donor MHC II is critical for induction of
allograft rejection. Donor, but not host, MHC II expression is
required for CD4+ T cell-mediated rejection in a mouse model of
cardiac transplants43. The absence of surface MHC II in donor
cells results in significant prolongation of primary cardiac allo-
graft survival44. Nevertheless, complete eradication of donor
MHC II in order to induce transplant tolerance in vivo has not
yet been considered a possibility45. Targeting costimulatory
ligands B7 and CD40 has shown promise in clinical trials46,
though deleterious effects in regulatory T cells (Tregs) and lack of
effect in memory T cells are significant limitations47,48. Low
MHC II expression not only constitutes reduction of signal 1 into
T cells; it also actively promotes tolerogenic responses49,50. Reg-
ulatory DCs (DCregs) are characterized by the low constitutive
expression of surface MHC molecules and low net expression of

 costimulatory molecules49. Such cells are functionally more
resistant to danger signals received through TLRs, promoting
apoptosis of effector T cells and generating Tregs. In transplan-
tation, different approaches have been attempted to harness the
therapeutic potential of such cells, including the administration of
donor DCregs or recipients’ DCregs pulsed with donor antigen
prior to transplantation51,52. A major risk with these approaches
is the sensitization of the recipient to donor antigens, leading to
the production of alloantibodies and antibody-mediated rejection,
both clearly documented in prior studies53,54. Our study offers an
alternative approach that can circumvent such risks by manip-
ulating donor MHC II levels, reducing early innate immune
activation critical to trigger T cells in the setting of ischemia-
reperfusion injury of allografts. Whether this approach would
induce a tolerant state to donor antigens in combination with
other immunosuppressive drugs requires further investigation.
Optimal T cell activation requires three signals: (i) recognition
of T cell receptor by a peptide:MHC complex; (ii) co-stimulatory
receptors, mainly engagement of CD28 on the T cell by B7
molecules on DCs and (iii) production of cytokines by DCs which
will shape the type of T cell response55. Immune checkpoint
modulators are emerging as powerful therapeutic tools for use in
tumor immunology, but also in autoimmunity, transplantation,
and asthma. In transplantation, most of such therapies focus on
co-stimulatory (signal 2) blockade. The effect of DnaK on
CD103+ DCs demonstrated in this study highlights a therapeutic
potential for mitigating all three signal steps. The use of other
immunosuppressive drugs such as CTLA-4-Ig23 and anti-CD822
is not enough to improve skin graft survival like DnaK was
capable of. Since we had immersed donor skin tissues in a solu-
tion containing DnaK (Fig. 3a), it is possible that part of the effect
observed up to 4 days after transplantation (after donor DCs were
gone from dLN—Fig. 3b–g) could be related to an effect of DnaK
directly in host cross-dressed CD103+ DCs. However, our find-
ings that DnaK could not prolong allograft survival when skin
grafts were IL-10- (Fig. 5) or March1-deficient (Fig. 6) indicates
that DnaK’s effect is primarily occurring on donor DCs. The sole
administration of DnaK to the donor organ has a putative
advantage in minimizing any potential side effect in the recipient.
The complexity of signals required for rejection modulation in a
long-term is a clinical challenge that will certainly involve a
combination of different and complementary drug targets.
Therefore, the identification of other molecules capable of indu-
cing March1 in APCs could thus constitute a promising line of
investigation in the modulation of inflammatory disorders.
Consistent with previous studies, we demonstrated ERK
activity to modulate IL-10 production56,57. This is the first report
to link ERK and STAT3 in the regulation of March1 expression,

 advancing the known scope for ERK-STAT3 signaling in immune
regulation. Indeed, this study identifies a novel mechanism of
how STAT3 activation may dampen an immune response via
March1-mediated downregulation of MHC II. The molecular
contexts
which
govern
the
immunological
outcome
of
STAT3 signaling are beyond the scope of this study. However, as
shown here, STAT3 may be targeted by agents such as DnaK to
favor a desired immunological state for therapeutic purpose.
DnaK also induced March1 in an IL-10-dependent manner. IL-10
is a major anti-inflammatory cytokine and is required for early
acceptance of skin allografts58. In human monocyte-derived
macrophages, STAT3 can bind to the IL-10 promoter and induce
IL-10
production59.
In
addition,
IL-10
exerts
its
anti-
inflammatory role in a STAT3-dependent manner60. In our
model, DnaK triggers IL-10 signaling, activates STAT3 and
induces the expression of March1. These results underline the
intricacy of pathway interactions necessary for the induction of
March1. Although Mittal et al.61 has shown that IL-10 modulates
MHC II and CD86 independently on March1 induction in DCs,
other studies have demonstrated that the two are connected in
control of MHC II expression in DCs17,28,62. Thus, the simplest
explanation for our findings is that DnaK can activate other
signaling pathways concomitantly with the IL-10 axis. One evi-
dence supporting this line of thought is that when we treat DCs
with dexamethasone (Fig. 4a), a known IL-10 inducer, this is not
enough to upregulate March1 expression in DCs.
We found that DnaK can induce MARCH1 and downregulate
MHC II levels in human monocyte-, bone-marrow-derived and
skin DCs. Given the importance of these cell types and MHC II to
alloreactive responses, our findings are relevant for the already
evident critical role of innate immune activation in precipitating
rejection and reducing graft survival63–65. Prolonged ischemic
time of the graft correlates with higher rejection rates in deceased
donor organ transplants63,64, and is associated with higher MHC
expression65, demonstrating the impact of enhanced innate
components due to severe ischemia on adaptive immunity.
Therefore, the development of therapies targeting the donor
organ without systemic toxicity are greatly warranted. DnaK
treatment of skin allograft could thus pave the way for new
strategies to modulate donor MHC II expression prior to trans-
plant and locally reduce early alloimmune responses. Further
studies, in combination with other immunosuppressive drugs, are
necessary to determine the benefits of this strategy in transplant
outcomes.
Methods
Mice. BALB/c (H-2Kd/I-Ad) and C57Bl/6 (B6, H-2Kb/I-Ab) mice were purchased
from Fundação Estadual de Produção e Pesquisa em Saúde (FEPPS—Rio Grande
do Sul, Brazil) or from The Jackson Laboratory. B6 CD45.1 (B6.SJL-Ptprca Pepcb/
BoyJ) and MHC II−/− (B6.129S2-H2dlAb1-Ea/J) mice were purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory. C3H/HeJ (C3H, H-2Kk/I-Ak) mice were provided by Dr. Niels
Câmara (University of São Paulo, São Paulo, Brazil) or purchased from The
Jackson Laboratory. March1−/− (H-2Kb/I-Ab) mice14 were provided by Dr.
Jeoung-Sook Shin (University of California, San Francisco, USA). Batf3−/− mice
were both generated and maintained as breeding colonies in Harvard Medical
School facility. Il10−/− (H-2Kb/I-Ab) mice were provided by Dr. Ana M. C. Faria
(Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil). C57BL/6-GFP (H-
2Kb/I-Ab) mice were provided by Dr. Gustavo B. Menezes (Federal University of
Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, Brazil). All mice used in the experiments were
females between six to 10 weeks old. Animals were bred and housed in individual
and standard mini-isolators under specific pathogen-free conditions at the School
of Biosciences—Pontifícia Universidade Católica do Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS)
or Harvard Medical School facility. All animals were housed in accordance with the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) and National Institutes of
Health (NIH) Animal Care guidelines.
Protein purification and endotoxins removal. The M. tuberculosis DnaK gene
(Gene ID: 885946) was synthesized, subcloned and cloned into the pET23a(+)
vector at the NdeI and BamHI sites by GenScript (USA). BL21(DE3) Escherichia
coli cells were transformed, and the expressed protein was purified according to
methods described previously66. To remove lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Triton
X-114 was used according to the method described in Aida, et al67. Residual Triton
X-114 (Sigma) was removed by overnight incubation with Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad) at
4 °C. Protein concentration was determined using a Qubit Protein Assay Kit
(Invitrogen), which was read on a Qubit® Fluorometer (Invitrogen). Protein
integrity was analyzed by Western Blot using anti-Hsp70 antibody (clone C92F3A-
5—StressMarq; Supplementary Fig. 11a). Endotoxin levels were measured during
all purification steps (Supplementary Fig. 11b) using a chromogenic limulus
amebocyte lysate (LAL) endotoxin assay kit (GenScript). Only samples with
endotoxin levels below 0.1 EU/mL were used. To check protein purity, we took
advantage of the fact that the splenic DCs upregulate CD86 levels after 6 h of
intravenous injection of LPS68. We intravenously injected B6 mice with either
25 µg of LPS, 30 µg of DnaK, 30 µg of Triton X-114-treated DnaK, or control
(phosphate-buffered saline [PBS] treated with Bio-Beads). Mice were sacrificed
after 6 h and analyzed for CD86 expression in splenic DCs (CD11c+) by flow
cytometry35. LPS and non-treated DnaK increased the expression of CD86 in
splenic DCs. In contrast, mice injected with DnaK or PBS treated with Triton X-
114 showed no upregulation of CD86 in splenic DCs (Supplementary Fig. 11b).
DnaK has adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity, so we tested our purified
protein for its ability to hydrolyze adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Functional DnaK
(5 µg) and nonfunctional DnaK (5 µg) were incubated at 37 °C in a reaction
medium containing 2 mM calcium chloride, 120 mM sodium chloride (NaCl),
5 mM potassium chloride, 10 mM glucose, 20 mM hydroxyethyl piper-
azineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) with 100 µM ATP at pH 7.4 for 0, 10, 20, 60, and
120 min. After the incubation, the reaction medium was transferred to ice and
centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of 40 μL supernatant were
injected onto a C18 reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) column using a mobile phase containing 60 mM potassium dihydrogen
phosphate (KH2PO4, Sigma-Aldrich) and 5 mM tetrabutylammonium chloride
(Sigma-Aldrich), pH 6.0, in 30% methanol. All peaks were identified by retention
time compared to an ATP standard curve. The control for non-enzymatic
hydrolysis of nucleotides was performed by measuring the peaks present in the
same reaction medium incubated without proteins. The results are expressed as
total amount of the ATP (µM) at the respective incubation time (Supplementary
Fig. 11c).
Skin transplant and in situ treatment. We performed a fully MHC-mismatched
murine skin allograft model69. B6 WT, March1−/−, MHC II−/− or Il10−/− mice
(all H-2Kb/I-Ab), or C3H (H-2Kk/I-Ak) were used as donors. Briefly, 1 cm2 sections
of tail skin were removed and immersed in PBS or PBS containing 60 µg/mL of
purified DnaK for 60 min at 4 °C. BALB/c (H-2d/I-Ad) recipients were anesthe-
tized, and fur was shaved off the dorsal trunk. At the shaved area, 1 cm2 of skin was
removed in each recipient mouse, and donor tail skin fragment was sutured to the
exposed tissue of each recipient. Animals were kept in individual cages and the
state of graft acceptance was photographed and recorded daily. Graft rejection was
confirmed by the observation of cyanosis, erythema, erosion, and loss of skin graft.
PBMCs isolation from healthy volunteers’ blood. Peripheral blood samples were
obtained from healthy subjects and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
were then isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque solution
(GE Healthcare). Cells were washed in PBS and plated for dendritic cells
differentiation.
Murine dendritic cell cultures. CD11c+ cells were isolated from LNs of B6 WT,
March1−/− and Il10−/− mice. LNs were disrupted against a nylon screen and
treated with Collagenase D (Roche) for 30 min at 37 °C. The resultant single cell
suspensions were labeled with anti-CD11c (N418) magnetic beads (Miltenyi). After
washing, CD11c+ cells were purified by positive selection using MACS separation
columns (Miltenyi). Purity (≥85%) of selected cells (CD11chighMHC IIhigh cells)
was controlled by flow cytometry analysis before and after the cultures. Cells were
cultured in 96-well plates in AIM-V serum-free medium (Gibco). DCs were
incubated media (control) or media containing 30 µg/mL of DnaK for 24 h and
analyzed by flow cytometry or total RNA was extracted. The supernatant was
collected and used for cytokine analysis.
DCs were grown from murine bone marrow (BMDCs) in the presence of
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and IL-4 (both from
Peprotech). Cells were cultured in 24-well plates in AIM-V serum-free medium
(Gibco). Non-adherent cells (DCs) were separated from adherent cells after six
days in culture. BMDCs were incubated for 24 h with media alone (control), media
containing either 30 µg/mL of DnaK, 10 µg/mL of peptidoglycan (Sigma) or 30 µg/
mL of DnaK and 20 ng/mL of recombinant murine IL-10 (R&D System); they were
analyzed by FACS or total RNA was extracted. Supernatants were collected and
used for cytokine analysis.
Flow-sorted DC subsets were cultured in 96-well plates with AIM-V serum-free
medium (Gibco) and treated with 30 µg/mL of DnaK for 24 h. Cells were then
analyzed by flow cytometry or total RNA extraction. Purity (≥90%) of sorted cells
was controlled by flow cytometry analysis before and after the cultures.

 Real time polymerase chain reaction. Total RNA was isolated from murine or
human DC cultures using RNA Easy Kit (Qiagen). The concentration of the
purified total RNA samples was measured using a Qubit RNA Assay Kit (Invi-
trogen) and read in a Qubit Fluorometer (Invitrogen). RNA 50 ng was reverse
transcribed with 100 U of Sensiscript (Qiagen). cDNA concentrations were mea-
sured using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen) and then read in a Qubit
Fluorometer (Invitrogen). In a final volume of 10 µL, 8 ng of cDNA was amplified
using the following Taqman Gene Expression Assays (ThermoFisher Scientific):
Il10 (Mm00439614_m1), March1 (Mm00613524_m1), Actb (4352933E),
MARCH1 (Hs00215631_m1), IL10 (Hs00961622_m1) ACTB (Hs01060665_g1)
and GAPDH (Hs03929097_g1). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) was performed with a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosys-
tems). The relative mRNA levels were calculated using the comparative Ct method,
using the house keeping genes β-actin and GAPDH as an internal control. Non-
treated DCs served as a reference for treated DCs.
Immunofluorescence and microscopy. Isolated DCs were labeled or incubated
with DnaK at 37 °C for 24 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and permea-
bilized using 0.1% Triton-X 100 (for visualizing intracellular proteins) or not (for
surface expression or binding) using 0.1% Triton X 100. Cells were stained with
primary antibodies (anti-I-A/I-E [MHC II], clone M5/114, eBioscience; anti-
LAMP-1, clone 1D4B, Abcam) and then washed three times with 1 × PBS and
stained again with fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. Fluorophores
were visualized using the following filter sets: 488 nm excitation and band pass
505–530 nm emission filter for Alexa 488; 543 nm excitation and band pass
560–615 nm for Cy3/Alexa 564 nm; and 633 nm excitation, in Zeiss Confocal
Microscopy.
Major histocompatibility complex II immunoprecipitation. LN DCs were treated
with or without DnaK. Cells were then washed with ice-cold Dulbecco’s PBS and
lysed in NP-40 lysis buffer (containing 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethyle-
nediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF),
1× HALT protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Thermo Scientific)). For
immunoprecipitation (IP), 1 mg of cell extract was incubated with 5 µg of anti-I-A/
I-E (MHC II—clone M5/114, eBioscience) for 2 h at 4 °C followed by incubation
with 20 µL of protein A (50% slurry, GE Healthcare) plus sepharose beads for
either 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C. The beads were then washed
with NP-40 lysis buffer and complexes were eluted by boiling in Laemmli sample
buffer. For Western Blotting analysis, precipitated protein was resolved by 4–15%
gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
and transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes. Membranes were
immunoblotted with primary antibodies (anti-ubiquitin mouse, clone P4D1, Cell
Signaling) and later secondary antibodies that were horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated. The membrane reactions were visualized by Perkin Elmer-enhanced
chemiluminescence reagents. For control input, 15–30 μg of protein were resolved
by 4–15% gradient SDS-PAGE and transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes
were immunoblotted with primary antibodies and later secondary antibodies that
were HRP-conjugated. The membrane reactions were visualized by Perkin Elmer-
enhanced chemiluminescence reagents.
Flow cytometry. The following antibodies were used for murine cells: CD4
(GK1.5), CD8 (53-6.7), Ki67 (B56), CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL-14), IFN-γ
(XMG1.2), I-Ab (AF6-120.1), I-Ad (39-10-8), CD11c (HL3), CD45R/B220 (RA3-
6B2), CD11b (M1/70), CD103 (M290), CCR7 (CD197—4B12), CD86 (GL1), CD19
(1D3), IL-10 (JES5-16E3), CD45.1 (A20), CD45.2 (104), p-Akt (pS473; M89-61), p-
STAT6 (pY641; 18/P-Stat6), p-ERK1/2 (pT202/pY204; 20 A), and p-STAT3
(pY705; 4/P-STAT3) from BD Biosciences; CD207 (Langerin—eBioRMUL.2) and
Y-Ae (eBioY-Ae) from eBioscience; H-2Kd (SF1-1.1), F4/80 (BM8), CD19 (6D5),
Ly-6G (1A8), CD3 (145-2C11) and CD11c (N418) from Biolegend. For human
cells, we used CD14 (M5E2), CD83 (HB15e), CD86 (2331/FUN-1), HLA-DR
(TU36), CD3 (UCHT1) from BD Biosciences; CD45 (HI30), HLA-DR (L243),
CD141 (M80), CD1c (L161), CD11c (3.9) from Biolegend. Cell suspensions were
Fc blocked for 20 min on ice, and then surface markers were stained by incubation
for 30 min with antibodies in 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) in phosphate-buffered
saline (PBS) on ice. Staining of Ki67, IL-10 and IFN-γ was performed by using the
Fixation/Permeabilization Kit (eBioscience). For IFN-γ detection, cell suspensions
were pre-incubated for 6 h with 50 ng/mL of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate
(PMA), 500 ng/mL ionomycin, and GolgiStop (BD Biosciences) in 10% FBS RPMI
before Fc blocking, followed by surface staining, permeabilization, and intracellular
staining of IFN-γ. Cells were analyzed using FACSCantoII (BD Biosciences) and
BD FACSDiva software (BD Biosciences). Flow sorting was performed on a FACS
Aria II (BD Biosciences). Doublets were excluded based on forward scatter and side
scatter characteristics (FSC/SSC) and dead cells by staining with Fixable Viability
Dye eFluor 780 (eBioscience) or Zombie NIR Fixable Viability Kit (Biolegend).
Data obtained were analyzed using Flowjo software (version X, Tree Star).
Analysis of phosphorylated molecules. For signaling experiments, BMDCs were
treated with 30 μM of selective MEK inhibitor PD98059 (Cayman Chemical) for
30 min, or 1 µM of p-STAT3 inhibitor BP-1-102 (Selleck Chem) for 24 h or DMSO
prior DnaK stimulation. Cells were stimulated with 30 µg/mL of DnaK for 15, 30,
or 45 min. Cells were fixed with Cytofix Buffer (BD Biosciences) for 10 min at 37 °C
and permeabilized with Phosflow Perm Buffer III (BD Biosciences) for 30 min on
ice. Then, cells were stained for p-Akt, p-STAT6, p-ERK, and p-STAT3. Cells were
analyzed using FACSCantoII (BD Biosciences) and BD FACSDiva software (BD
Biosciences). Data obtained were analyzed with Flowjo software (version X, Tree
Star). BioHeat maps were generated with the web−based software Cytobank (www.
cytobank.org).
Generation of human dendritic cells. Monocytes were isolated from PBMCS by
adherence to plastic at 37 °C, 5% CO2 for 2 h. Adherent cells were cultured in in 24-
well plates in AIM-V serum-free medium (Gibco) supplemented with human GM-
CSF and IL-4 (both at 50 ng/ml from Peprotech). After 5 days, human TNF-α
(500 UI/ml, from Peprotech) was added for Mo-DCs maturation. On day 7, Mo-
DCs were treated with 30 µg/mL of DnaK for 24 h. After that, cells harvested and
analyzed by FACS or total RNA was extracted.
Bone marrow cells from healthy volunteers were obtained via BWH Tissue
Bank and red blood cells were hemolyzed using ACK lysing buffer (Lonza). Single
cell suspension was prepared in serum-free AIM-V medium (Gibco) at 1 × 106
cells/ml and cultured for 5 days at 37 °C 5% CO2, in the presence of 20 ng/ml
human IL-4 and 20 ng/ml human GM-CSF (Biolegend). IL-4 and GM-CSF were
supplemented again on day 3 of culture. DnaK was added to the media at 30 µg/ml
on the 6th day of culture and the cells were incubated for another 24 h before used
for mixed lymphocyte reaction.
Isolation and quantification of skin immune cells. Immune cells from human
skin were isolated, as described previously70. Briefly, skin tissues were minced into
small pieces in 10% FCS-supplemented RPMI, followed by incubation in Col-
lagenase D (Sigma, 0.2%) and DNAse (Invitrogen, 30 Kunitz Units/mL) at 37 °C
for 2 h with shaking. After passing through 70 µm cell-strainer, cells were washed
and recovered in RPMI media (Lonza) supplemented with 20% FCS, 100 mM L-
glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. Total skin cell numbers were
calculated using fluorescent AccuCheck Counting Beads (Invitrogen). Beads were
added to each sample after the final wash step, and cells were analyzed on a
FACSCantoII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data obtained were analyzed with
Flowjo software (version X, Tree Star).
IFN-γ ELISPOT assays. Mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT assays were performed using
mouse IFN-γ ELISPOT kit (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA), according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, 96-well ELISPOT plates were coated with IFN-γ
capture antibody at 4 °C overnight, followed by blocking with culture medium
(10% FCS-supplemented RPMI1640) for 1 h at room temperature. Lymphocytes
were isolated from mouse allograft draining lymph nodes at 96-hour post-trans-
plant by magnetic separation using the Pan T Cell Isolation Kit II (Miltenyi Biotec)
or EasySep Mouse T Cell Isolation Kit (StemCell Technologies). 5 × 105 T cells
were incubated together with 5 × 105 irradiated donor, host-derived or third-party
splenocytes at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 48 h. T cells were also incubated with 5 × 105
irradiated skin cells isolated from WT or Batf3−/− allografts, transplanted 24 h
before the cell culture setup at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 48 h. Alternatively, splenic T cells
isolated from naive mice were incubated together with WT or March1−/− BMDCs
at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 24 h. Detected spots were counted using an ImmunoSpot
analyzer (Cellular Technology).
Human IFN-γ ELISPOT assays were similarly performed as above, using
human IFN-γ ELISPOT kit (R&D Systems). 5 × 105 human peripheral blood
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were cultured together with 5 × 105 irradiated human
BMDCs prepared as above, at 37 °C 5% CO2 for 24 h.
Mixed lymphocyte reaction. Human PBMCs were labeled with Cell Trace Violet
(Invitrogen) and co-cultured with carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-
labeled BMDCs in RPMI with 10% human serum, L-glutamine and penicillin/
streptomycin for 5 days at 37 °C, 5% CO2. Cell proliferation was analyzed by flow
cytometry using FACS Canto II (BD Biosciences).
Statistical analysis. Statistical analysis was performed using the software Prism5
(Graphpad Software Inc.). Differences between specific points were determined by
the Student’s t-test, or when appropriated, the nonparametric Mann–Whitney. The
one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to determine differences
between groups. Multiple comparisons among levels were checked with Tukey
posthoc tests. To analyze graft survival and determine the MST, the Kaplan–Meier/
log-rank test was used. The level of significance was set at p < 0.05. In all experi-
ments, we used at least 3 samples per studied group.
Study approval. All procedures were previously reviewed and approved by the
Ethics Committee for the Use of Animals of Pontifícia Universidade Católica do
Rio Grande do Sul (CEUA-PUCRS) under protocol ID CEUA 12/00316, Harvard
Medical School IACUC 2016N000250 and Brigham and Women’s Hospital
