Monoclonal antibodies are one of the fastest growing classes of pharmaceutical products,
however, their potential is limited by the high cost of development and manufacturing. Here
we present a safe and cost-effective platform for in vivo expression of therapeutic antibodies
using nucleoside-modified mRNA. To demonstrate feasibility and protective efficacy,
nucleoside-modified mRNAs encoding the light and heavy chains of the broadly neutralizing
anti-HIV-1 antibody VRC01 are generated and encapsulated into lipid nanoparticles. Systemic
administration of 1.4 mg kg � 1 of mRNA into mice results in B170 mg ml � 1 VRC01 antibody
concentrations in the plasma 24 h post injection. Weekly injections of 1 mg kg � 1 of mRNA
into immunodeficient mice maintain trough VRC01 levels above 40 mg ml � 1. Most impor-
tantly, the translated antibody from a single injection of VRC01 mRNA protects humanized
mice from intravenous HIV-1 challenge, demonstrating that nucleoside-modified mRNA
represents a viable delivery platform for passive immunotherapy against HIV-1 with expan-
sion to a variety of diseases.

onoclonal antibodies have emerged as highly effective
therapeutics for cancer, infectious diseases and auto-
immune disorders (reviewed in ref. 1). However,
the high cost of recombinant protein production limits its
use worldwide, but particularly in resource-limited settings.
Maintaining
effective
levels
of
therapeutic
antibody
(Ab)
requires frequent injection based on clearance and therapeutic
goal2.
Vector-mediated
antibody
gene
transfer
overcomes
these challenges by enabling high levels of Ab production
in situ for extended durations. At present, the preferred
vector is recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) containing
the Ab gene of interest3. AAV is a single stranded DNA virus,
which exists in an extra chromosomal state after infection.
A recent finding of AAV2 integration into known cancer genes
in hepatocellular carcinomas raises concerns about the safety
of this therapeutic approach4. Another problem associated
with
AAV
is
its
immunogenicity.
Despite
optimization,
AAV remains immunogenic and AAV-mediated gene transfer
of Ab, in certain instances, induced blocking anti-idiotype Ab5.
In
vitro-transcribed
(IVT)
mRNA,
the
minimal
vector
encoding genetic information, has fundamental advantages over
DNA- and viral-based systems, such as only requiring direct
uptake into the cytosol, which results in immediate protein
production,
and
the
lack
of
genomic
integration.
This
makes mRNA a safe and fully controllable delivery tool.
Moreover, unlike protein-based therapeutics, production of
mRNA is simple and cost effective; high levels of therapeutic
protein are produced, folded and modified by host cells and the
delivered mRNA is continuously translated for extended and
controllable durations.
To make IVT mRNA suitable for therapy, several qualities,
including stability and translatability have been improved.
We previously demonstrated that optimized coding sequence,
selected 30- and 50-UTRs, enzymatically generated 50 cap1
structures
and
long
30
poly(A)-tail
render
IVT
mRNA
substantially more stable and translatable. Moreover, FPLC
purification and incorporation of modified nucleosides, such as
1-methylpseudouridine (m1C), made the mRNA non-immuno-
genic and significantly increased translation6–8. Formulation
and route of delivery in vivo also impact the translational
kinetics of
the IVT mRNA. Using a mouse
model,
we
recently demonstrated that lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are
efficient
mRNA
carriers
enabling
high
levels
of
protein
production for extended periods of time when administered by
a variety of routes9.
Several studies have reported that RNA-based vaccines could
elicit strong antigen-specific T and B cell immune responses
against infectious pathogens10–15. The inherent adjuvant activity
of RNA might be beneficial for vaccination but is detrimental
for applications in which the mRNA encodes a therapeutic
protein. For this, the IVT mRNA needs to be non-immunogenic
to avoid adverse events, including the release of proinflammatory
cytokines, the inhibition of translation and the generation of
anti-drug antibodies.
Here we demonstrate that nucleoside-modified mRNA encap-
sulated into LNPs is an effective tool for protein therapy. Using
LNP-formulated, m1C-containing mRNAs encoding the light
and heavy chains of VRC01, a broadly neutralizing antibody
against HIV-1 (ref. 16), we demonstrate that systemically
delivered mRNA-LNPs are quickly translated into functional
antibody. Furthermore, we show that a single injection of VRC01
mRNA-LNPs
can
fully
protect
humanized
mice
against
intravenous challenges with the SF162 and JR-CSF HIV-1
isolates. These findings serve as the basis for the use of the
nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP platform for delivery of anti-
HIV-1 Abs, as well as, other therapeutic antibodies and proteins.
Results
Administration of a single dose of VRC01 mRNA-LNPs.
In accordance with our previous findings, intravenous (i.v.)
delivery of mRNA-LNPs resulted in robust protein expression
in the liver (Supplementary Fig. 1 and ref. 9). To determine the
kinetics of VRC01, a human monoclonal antibody, production
from mRNA-LNPs, BALB/c mice were injected i.v. with a single
dose of 30 mg (1.4 mg kg � 1) of LNP-formulated m1C-modified
mRNA encoding the heavy and light chains of the VRC01 Ab
in equimolar concentrations or the control firefly luciferase
(Luc). VRC01 levels were measured every other day for 11 days
(Fig.
1).
Antibody
levels
peaked
at
24 h
post
injection
and
displayed
a
gradual
decrease,
remaining
between
130–170 mg ml � 1 for 5 days. A sharper decrease in the level of
VRC01 Ab was observed by day 7 and antibody levels were below
detection at day 11 post injection. The very small error bars
indicate that similar levels of VRC01 Ab were measured in
each animal injected, demonstrating the reproducibility of dosing
with nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNPs. The increased rate of
clearance of human IgG in mice is noted.
Weekly injections of VRC01 mRNA-LNPs. To avoid antibody
induction against the VRC01 human protein in mice, NOD-scid
gamma (NSG) mice were used. Animals received five i.v. injec-
tions of 30 mg (1 mg kg � 1) of VRC01-encoding m1C-modified
mRNA-LNPs at a weekly interval and antibody levels were
measured 7 days after each injection (Fig. 2). High VRC01
Ab levels could be maintained by weekly injections. An important
observation from this data was that there was no reduction in the
level of translation with subsequent injections. Antibody levels
maintained a trough level between B40 and 60 mg ml � 1.
Investigation of immune activation by VRC01 mRNA-LNPs.
It is well documented that systemic delivery of nucleic acids,
including conventional and unpurified IVT mRNA, induces
immune activation that results in production of type I interferons
(IFNs) and proinflammatory cytokines8,17. To determine immune
activation by the nucleoside-modified, FPLC-purified mRNA-
LNPs, C57Bl/6 mice were injected i.v. with a single dose
(1 mg kg � 1)
of
LNP-formulated
mRNA
encoding
firefly
luciferase (Luc). Plasma was collected at 2 and 4 h post
injection and type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokine levels
were measured by Luminex assay (Fig. 3). We have previously
found that unpurified nucleoside-modified mRNA always induces
a low but measurable level of immune activation and FPLC

 purification removes all immunogenicity8. Thus, a commercially
available,
Luc-encoding,
nucleoside-modified,
unpurified
(immunogenic) mRNA was included in the study as a positive
control. No increase in levels of interleukin-6, IFN-a and tumour
necrosis factor-a was measured in plasma obtained from
mice that were injected with LNP-formulated, FPLC-purified,
m1C mRNA-LNPs.
To demonstrate that nucleoside-modified mRNA administra-
tion does not induce antibody production against the encoded
protein, BALB/c mice received weekly intraperitoneal injections
of 0.1 mg of murine erythropoietin (muEPO) encoding mRNA
and
anti-EPO
antibody
levels
from
mouse
plasma
were
monitored over time. No anti-EPO Ab production was detected
after 5 weekly injections (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Protection from HIV-1 challenge by mRNA-LNPs. Prophylactic
administration of potent monoclonal antibodies against infectious
pathogens
can
protect
healthy
individuals
from
infection
(reviewed in ref. 18). To investigate whether systemic delivery
of mRNA-LNPs encoding VRC01 could protect animals from
HIV-1 viral challenge, two forms of humanized mice were used.
CD34-NSG humanized mice were generated by injection of
human CD34 þ stem cells. This model system has circulating and
splenic human CD4 þ T cells but no human lymphoid cells in
tissues,
including
genital
tract,
lymph
nodes,
and
the
gastrointestinal tract19, therefore they can be infected with
HIV-1 after parenteral virus administration. The second model
were BLT (bone marrow, liver, thymus) mice that also contain
lymphoid human cells20. Typically, approximately half of the
lymphoid cells in the blood are of human origin (Supplementary
Figs 3a and 4). Animals had normal T and B cell ratios and
CD4 þ and CD8 þ T cell ratios (Supplementary Fig. 3b,c).
A dose response experiment was performed to characterize
antibody production from various amounts of VRC01 mRNA-
LNPs in BLT humanized mice. Moreover, to directly compare the
efficacy of the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP platform to
recombinant protein delivery, a group of animals was injected
with recombinant, purified VRC01 mAb. A single dose of 30 mg
(1.4 mg kg � 1), 15 mg (0.7 mg kg � 1) or 7.5 mg (0.35 mg kg � 1) of
m1C-modified VRC01 mRNA-LNPs or 600 mg (28 mg kg � 1) of
VRC01 mAb or 30 mg of Luc-encoding mRNA-LNPs was
administered by the i.v. route and VRC01 Ab concentrations
were measured 24 h post-injection. Strikingly, plasma VRC01
levels were 1.65 times higher in mice injected with 30 mg of
VRC01 mRNA-LNPs compared to animals injected with 600 mg
of
VRC01
mAb
(mean
values
of
204.7 mg ml � 1
and
123.4 mg ml � 1, respectively) (Fig. 4a). A mean plasma VRC01
concentration of 65.5 mg ml � 1 and 23.5 mg ml � 1 was measured
in animals injected with the 15 mg and 7.5 mg VRC01 mRNA-LNP
doses, respectively. After confirmation of high antibody levels
in the VRC01 injected animals, mice were challenged with
the SF162 HIV-1 isolate by the i.v. route. Mice were bled 2 weeks
post-challenge and viral RNA levels were measured in plasma by
quantitative real-time PCR (qRT–PCR; Fig. 4b). Viral RNA was
detected in all Luc mRNA-injected animals and 5 of 6 animals
that received the lowest dose (7.5 mg) of VRC01 mRNA-LNPs.
The latter data demonstrates that 23.5 mg ml � 1 VRC01 Ab
concentration in the plasma is not protective against challenge
with the SF162 HIV-1 isolate. Viral loads were below detection
(1 copy per ml plasma, 10 ml was used for the measurement) in
all mice that were treated with 30 mg or 15 mg of VRC01 mRNA-
LNPs or 600 mg VRC01 protein before HIV-1 challenge.
To confirm our findings, HIV-1 challenge experiments were
repeated with the JR-CSF HIV-1 viral isolate. The IC50’s of
neutralization of JR-CSF and SF162 are 0.164 and 0.421 mg ml � 1,
respectively, demonstrating that SF162 is approximately three
times more difficult to neutralize21. CD34-NSG humanized mice
were injected i.v. with 30 mg (1 mg kg � 1) of VRC01 or Luc
mRNA-LNPs

Discussion
Monoclonal antibody therapeutics are among the fastest growing
segments of pharmaceutical development with applications in
cancer, autoimmune diseases and bone metabolism (reviewed in
ref. 1). A great body of knowledge has been accumulated on the
administration of Abs as proteins or encoded by viruses and
DNAs, but there is no available data on the investigation of Ab-
encoding mRNA therapy. In this report, we evaluated the kinetics
and protective efficacy of nucleoside-modified, FPLC-purified
mRNA-based delivery of the VRC01 broadly neutralizing anti-
HIV Ab.
Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies are typically produced by
cell lines, such as Chinese hamster ovary cells, followed by
extensive purification of the antibody from cell culture super-
natant and pharmaceutical formulation. Production of antibodies
has
many
challenges,
including
misfolding
or
incorrect
post-translational modification that can lead to adverse events.
The purification is specific for each type of monoclonal antibody,
requiring the development of a new method for each, thus
making production expensive. In contrast, production and
purification of IVT mRNA is simple, fast and cost effective,
as it does not require complex and expensive laboratory
infrastructure and the same methods can be used for all
mRNAs23,24.
Transfer of genes encoding antibodies is a novel strategy and
the most common gene transfer vehicle is AAV (reviewed in
ref. 3), although lentiviral vectors and plasmids have also
been studied. Muthumani et al.25 electroporated 25 mg of
VRC01 Fab-encoding plasmid, intramuscularly. This approach
yielded modest levels (2–3 mg ml � 1) of VRC01 Fab in serum
measurable for over 10 days post administration. Gene transfer of
anti-HIV Ab by lentiviral vectors enabled stable Ab production,
however the need for ex vivo transduction of cells with the vector
greatly limits the use of this platform in large scale studies26,27.
Balazs et al.28 performed AAV vector-mediated gene transfer
studies
where
they
expressed
native
anti-HIV
antibodies,
including VRC01 in mice. Depending on the administered
dose,
antibody
concentrations
could
peak
higher
than
100 mg ml � 1 after intramuscular injection of AAV and lasted
over a year. Protection from HIV-1 viral challenge in humanized
mice was also demonstrated. The use of AAV vector-mediated
antibody gene transfer has been extended to other targets, such as
RSV, influenza and cancer (reviewed in ref. 3). However, the
identification of AAV genomes in tumour-associated genes of
hepatocellular carcinomas has recently raised safety concerns
about
the
therapeutic
use
of
AAVs4.
In
addition,
the
immunogenicity of AAVs has been associated with clearance of
virally infected cells resulting in the loss of protein expression and
the induction of immune responses against the encoded protein,

 even
when

such
as
erythropoietin29. As VRC01 is a human protein, we could not

its
immunogenicity.
In
previous
studies,
where
erythropoietin encoding mRNA was repeatedly given to mice at
a
weekly
interval,
no
antibody
responses
were
found17
(Supplementary Fig. 2). IVT mRNA holds promise to be a safe
and controllable alternative to DNA and viral based therapeutic
delivery platforms. The discoveries that nucleoside modification
and FPLC purification of IVT mRNA makes it unable to activate
RNA sensors and induce type I IFNs, proinflammatory cytokines,
and translation suppressive effectors (reviewed in refs 30,31)
opens up an array of therapeutic applications, including protein
replacement, gene therapy, and protein therapeutics. A series
of
studies
have
recently
been
published
using
modified
nucleoside-containing IVT mRNA for protein therapy in mice
and monkeys demonstrating its feasibility for development of
human therapeutics17,32–36. Moreover, a great variety of mRNA
complexing
formulations
have
been
developed,
and
lipid
nanoparticles, originally created for siRNA delivery37–40, have
proven to be safe and very efficient mRNA carriers for in vivo
administration9.
A number of important features of nucleoside-modified mRNA
delivered in LNPs are demonstrated. First, a single i.v. injection of
30 mg (1.4 mg kg � 1) of VRC01 mRNA-LNPs into BALB/c mice
consistently
resulted
in
serum
antibody
concentrations
of
170 mg ml � 1 at 24 h post injection across treated mice, which
greatly exceeds the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)
of
VRC01
Ab
against
a
variety
of
HIV-1
isolates21,41.
High antibody concentrations could be measured for up to
9 days and could be maintained by repeated weekly injections.
Second, the inability of nucleoside-modified and FPLC-purified
mRNA-LNPs
to
activate
the
innate
immune
system
was
demonstrated in 2 manners. The clinically most important was
the demonstration that repeated deliveries at one week intervals
resulted in no decrease in the levels of translation of subsequent
doses. In addition, no increase in type I IFN and proinflammatory
cytokine production was detected after i.v. administration of
nucleoside-modified and FPLC-purified mRNA-LNPs (Fig. 3).
Prophylactic immunization with monoclonal antibody protein
in humanized mice typically uses 10–20 mg kg � 1 doses to reach
therapeutic concentrations22,42. In this study, we demonstrated
that
15 mg
(0.7 mg kg � 1)
of
nucleoside-modified
mRNA
encapsulated in LNPs delivered by the i.v. route protected
humanized mice from HIV challenge. The data presented here
demonstrate that the nucleoside-modified mRNA-LNP platform
is a safe, simple, and efficient alternative to therapeutic protein
delivery with potential application to any monoclonal antibody
with extension to any therapeutic protein.

Formulation of mRNA in lipid nanoparticles. IVT mRNAs encoding the light

lation. FPLC-purified m1C-containing firefly luciferase or VRC01 light and heavy
chain-encoding mRNAs were encapsulated in LNPs using a self-assembly process
in which an aqueous solution of mRNA at pH 4.0 is rapidly mixed with a solution
of lipids dissolved in ethanol38. LNPs used in this study were similar in
composition to those described previously37,38, which contain an ionizable cationic
lipid/phosphatidylcholine/cholesterol/PEG-lipid (50:10:38.5:1.5 mol mol � 1) and
were encapsulated at an RNA-to-total lipid ratio of B0.05 (wt/wt). They had a
diameter of B80 nm, as measured by dynamic light scattering using a Zetasizer
Nano ZS (Malvern Instruments Ltd, Malvern, UK) instrument. mRNA-LNP

in a final volume of 10 ml Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium was used. For
complexing different amounts of mRNA, the volumes of the reagents and the final
volume were scaled proportionally.
Mice. BALB/c mice. Female BALB/c mice were purchased from Harlan Labora-
tories. C57Bl/6 mice: animals were obtained from Charles River Laboratories.
CD34-NSG mice. NSG mice were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory
(strain number 005557). Male and female mice between 6–8 weeks of age were used
at the initiation of each experiment. Humanized CD34-NSG mice were generated
by injecting NSG mice i.v. with 100,000 human CD34 þ hematopoietic stem cells
after conditioning with busulfan (30 mg kg � 1) for 24 h. 12 weeks after stem cell
injection, mice were bled and engraftment of human immune cells was
confirmed by staining with the CD45-PE (BD Biosciences, Cat. Number 555483),
CD19-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences, Cat. Number 340951), CD33-FITC
(BD Biosciences, Cat. Number 555626) and CD3-APC (BD Biosciences,
Cat. Number 555335) antibodies and performing flow cytometric analyses
(Supplementary Fig. 4).
BLT mice. NSG mice were bred in house using original breeding stock
obtained from the Jackson Laboratory (strain number 005557). Male and
female mice between 7–10 weeks of age were used for human immune system
reconstitution 12–16 weeks prior to experimentation. BLT mice are NSG mice
with a reconstituted human immune system, generated by injecting NSG mice
i.v. with 100–125,000 human CD34 þ hematopoietic stem cells 24 h post busulfan
(30 mg kg � 1) conditioning. Mice were surgically implanted 3–6 days post stem
cell transplant with 3–5 pieces of human fetal thymus measuring approximately
3–5 cubic mm under the renal capsule. Engraftment of human cells in BLT mice
was assessed 12–16 weeks after stem cell injection, by staining with the CD45-PE
(BD Biosciences, Cat. Number 555483), CD19-PerCP-Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences,
Cat. Number 340951), CD33-APC (BD Biosciences, Cat. Number 551378),
CD4-PerCp-Cy5.5 (BD Biosciences, Cat. Number 560650), CD8-FITC
(BD Biosciences, Cat. Number 555366) and CD3-APC (BD Biosciences,
Cat. Number 555335) antibodies and performing flow cytometric analyses
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
Power analysis was used to calculate the size of all animal groups to ensure
statistically significant results based on preliminary studies. Experiments were
performed 1 or more times to achieve the needed number of mice in each group to
achieve statistical significance. No randomization was used, beyond random
selection of mice into different treatment groups. All analyses of treated mice were
performed in the absence of knowledge of the treatment groups.
Administration of VRC01 mAb and VRC01 mRNA-LNPs to mice. All reagents
were diluted in Dulbecco’s Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) and injected into
animals i.v. with a 3/10cc 29½G insulin syringe (BD Biosciences). Several
independent mRNA syntheses and LNP encapsidations were used, but the same
preparation was used in BALB/c, NSG and CD34-NSG mice, which resulted in
different amounts of VRC01 circulating protein 24 h later.
Administration of TransIT-complexed mRNA into mice. The muEPO-encoding
mRNA was injected into the peritoneal cavity with a 27-gauge needle using
standard technique.
Blood collection. Blood was collected from the tail vein or from the peri-orbital
venous sinus. Blood was centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 r.p.m. and the plasma was
stored at � 80 �C until analyses.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. VRC01 antibody levels were determined
by ELISA using the VRC01 monoclonal antibody (NIH AIDS Reagent Program,
Cat. Number 120033) as a standard. Immulon 4 HBX high-binding plates were
coated with 100 ml of purified HIV-1 HXBc2 gp120 at a final concentration of
1 mg ml � 1 in PBS overnight at 4 �C. The plates were washed four times with
wash buffer (0.05% Tween-20 in PBS) and then blocked with blocking buffer
(2% BSA in PBS) for 1 h at room temperature, after which the plates were washed
three more times with wash buffer. Dilutions of plasma samples and standard were
made in blocking buffer (2% BSA in PBS) and incubated (100 ml per well) for 1 h at
room temperature. Samples and standard were removed and the plate was washed
four times with wash buffer. Detection antibody (Bethyl Laboratories, Cat. Number
A80-304 P) was diluted 1:100,000 in blocking buffer and incubated (100 ml per well)
for 1 h. After four washes, TMB substrate mixture (KPL) was added at 100 ml
per well for 20 min. 2 N sulfuric acid (50 ml per well) was used to stop the reaction,
and the optical density was read at 450 nm on a Dynex MRX Revelation microplate
reader.
Anti-muEPO Ab responses were measured by coating plates with muEPO
protein (R&D systems, Cat. Number 959-ME), as described above. Plasma from
mice receiving weekly muEPO encoding mRNA was diluted 1:10 in phosphate-
buffered saline and added to muEPO protein coated plates. A positive control
containing a rat anti-murine EPO mAb (R&D Systems) spiked into normal mouse
plasma was used. Bound antibodies were detected with goat anti-mouse and rat
Ig antisera labelled with peroxidase (Sigma). A concentration of 0.1 ng ml � 1 of
anti-muEPO antibody spiked into plasma-phosphate-buffered saline could be
detected.
Luminex assay. Blood was collected at 2 and 4 h post i.v. injection of mRNA-LNPs
or PBS. Plasma was obtained and stored, as described above. Type I IFN, cytokine
and chemokine levels were analysed using an Affymetrix (Santa Clara, CA)
36-analyte xMAP ProcartaPlex multiplex immunoassay on a Bio-Plex 200
(BioRad, Hercules, CA) device and data was evaluated using xPonent software
(V3.1) following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Intravenous HIV-1 challenge of humanized mice. Twenty four hours after
intravenous delivery of VRC01 or Luc mRNA-LNPs or VRC01 protein, humanized
mice were bled and VRC01 antibody levels were determined by ELISA. Mice were
then challenged intravenously with JR-CSF (10 ng p24) or SF162 (50 ng p24) grown
in PHA-blasts and obtained from the Penn CFAR core and diluted in PBS to a
volume of 100 ml. Blood samples of infected mice were obtained weekly to deter-
mine viral load (RNA copy numbers) in plasma. Three weeks after infection, mice
were killed and spleens dissected into single cell suspensions.
Genomic DNA isolation from mouse spleen. QIAamp DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen)
was used to isolate genomic DNA from spleen, as described in the QIAamp
DNA Micro Handbook, except that the final sample was dissolved in ultrapure
water.
Conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR). HIV-1 gag PCR was performed
by using 50 ng of splenic genomic DNA and the G20 (50-GTATGGGCAAGCAG
GGAGCTAGAA-30) and G55 (50-ATTTCTCCCACTGGGATAGGTGG-30)
gag-specific primers in a 50 ml reaction volume. To determine the sensitivity of
PCR, an HIV-1 integration standard (pNL4-3) was used as a template under
the same conditions43. GAPDH PCR was carried out using the following primers:
huGAPDH fw: 50-CCACCCATGGCAAATTCCATGGCA-30 and huGAPDH
rev: 50-TCTAGACGGCAGGTCAGGTCCACC-30. The thermal cycler
(Techne TC-5000, Bibby Scientific) was programmed to perform a 5-min hot start
at 94 �C, followed by 40 cycles: denaturation at 94 �C for 1 min, annealing at 55 �C
for 1 min and extension at 72 �C for 1 min. A 10-min final extension at 72 �C was
performed. PCR products were analysed on a 2% agarose gel with 1 mg ml � 1
ethidium bromide (Sigma) and was recorded with a UV transilluminator
(GelDoc 1000 gel imaging system, Bio-Rad).
Plasma viral load measurement. RNA was extracted directly from 30 ml of
EDTA-plasma using the method of Cillo et al.44 and the RNA pellet was
reconstituted in a final volume of 15 ml. Before extraction, a uniform quantity of
Replication Competent Avian Sarcoma (RCAS) virions were spiked into each
sample and amplified separately to verify virus/RNA recovery and lack of
PCR inhibition45. RNA was reverse transcribed using random hexamers and
subjected to realtime qPCR quantification using the LightCycler 480 Probes Master
(Roche; Indianapolis, IN), as described in Cillo et al.44. For each sample, the
qRT–PCR reaction was run in duplicate on 5 ml RNA (equivalent to 10 ml plasma);
no-reverse transcriptase reaction and RCAS amplification were run on one well per
sample using 2.5 ml RNA. The HIV-1 primer/probe targets the pol gene and detects
all group M clades (forward: 50-TTTGGAAAGGACCAGCAAA-30; reverse:
50-CCTGCCATCTGTTTTCCA-30; probe: 50-6FAM-AAAGGTGAAGGGGCAGT
AGTAATACA-Tamra-30) as described in ref. 44 and RCAS amplification used

 GGG TGG TCG TGC C-Tamra-30) as described in ref. 45. Quantification was
carried out on an ABI 7500FAST real-time thermocycler using an in vitro
transcribed RNA standard. The assay has a limit of quantification of 10 copies per
reaction, or 1 copy per ml of plasma.
Bioluminescence imaging. Bioluminescence imaging was performed with an IVIS
Spectrum imaging system (Caliper Life Sciences). Mice were administered
D-luciferin (Regis Technologies) at a dose of 150 mg kg � 1 intraperitoneally. Mice
were anesthetized after receiving D-luciferin in a chamber with 3% isoflurane
(Piramal Healthcare Limited) and placed on the imaging platform while being
maintained on 2% isoflurane via a nose cone. Mice were imaged at 5 min post
administration of D-luciferin using an exposure time of 5 s or longer to ensure that
the signal acquired was within the effective detection range (above noise levels and
below CCD saturation limit).
Statistical analyses. Statistical analyses were performed with Microsoft Excel and
Prism 5.0 f (GraphPad). Data was compared using Student’s t-test and one-way
analysis of variance with Bonferroni corrections.
Data availability. All data are available within the article and its Supplementary
Information file or from the authors upon request.
