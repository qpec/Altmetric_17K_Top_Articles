Purpose:
To gain more insight into the pathophysiological mech-
anisms of visual hallucinations (VHs) in patients with 
Parkinson disease (PD) by analyzing whole-brain rest-
ing-state functional connectivity in PD patients with VH 
(hereafter, referred to as PD + VH patients) and without 
VH (hereafter, referred to as PD 2 VH patients) and con-
trol participants.
Materials and 
Methods:
For this retrospective study, 15 PD + VH patients, 40 PD 
2 VH patients, and 15 control participants from a pro-
spective cohort study were included, which was approved 
by the local ethics board and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants. Functional connec-
tivity was calculated between 47 regions of interests, of 
which whole-brain and region-specific means were com-
pared by using a general linear model with false discovery 
rate control for multiple comparisons.
Results:
Whole-brain mean functional connectivity was signifi-
cantly lower in PD patients compared with control partic-
ipants, with regional decreases involving paracentral and 
occipital regions in both PD + VH and PD 2 VH patients 
(mean whole-brain functional connectivity in PD + VH vs 
PD 2 VH, 0.12 6 0.01 [standard deviation] vs 0.14 6 
0.03, respectively; control participants, 0.15 6 0.04; P 
, .05, corrected). In PD + VH patients, nine additional 
frontal, temporal, occipital, and striatal regions showed 
decreased functional connectivity compared with control 
participants (mean of these nine regions in PD + VH, PD 
2 VH, and control participants: 0.12 6 0.02, 0.14 6 0.03, 
and 0.16 6 0.04, respectively; P , .05, corrected). Rest-
ing-state functional connectivity was unrelated to motor 
performance (r = 0.182; P = .184) and related to cognitive 
deficits such as attention and perception (ρ, 20.555 and 
20.558, respectively; P , .05).
Conclusion:
The findings show a PD-related effect on resting-state 
functional connectivity of posterior and paracentral brain 
regions, whereas the presence of VH is associated with a 
more global loss of connectivity, related to attention and 
perception. These findings suggest that the pathophysio-
logical mechanisms of VH in PD may include a global loss 
of network efficiency, which could drive disturbed atten-
tional and visual processing.

images were screened for abnormalities 
by a radiologist). Functional MR imaging 
registrations were available of first and 
second follow-up visits, 4 years (2008 or 
2009) and 7 years (2011 or 2012) after 
initial inclusion. For the present retro-
spective study, we included the data of 
the last follow-up visit of PD patients 
and control participants in whom com-
plete clinical, neuropsychologic, and 
imaging data were available. All partic-
ipants gave written informed consent 
to participate in the research protocol, 
which was approved by the local institu-
tional ethics review board in adherence 
to the Helsinki declaration.
Clinical Assessment
PD patients were questioned on the 
presence of VH by using the Scales 
for Outcomes in Parkinson Disease 
Psychiatric Complications, which is a 
reliable, valid, and easy-to-administer 
questionnaire for psychiatric compli-
cations in PD (16). On the basis of a 
score of either 1 or greater or 0 on the 
first item, patients were classified as PD 
+ VH or PD 2 VH. Disease duration 
was calculated on the basis of a subjec-
tive estimate of the time since the first 
occurrence of the characteristic motor 
symptoms by the patient. The severity 
an effect in such studies by, for exam-
ple, influencing the ability to perform 
specific tasks in the imager. A resting-
state approach does not rely on in-
tact cognitive function of patients, but 
to our knowledge, has been applied 
only twice (11,12), whereby only pre-
defined networks or a seed-region were 
investigated. However, on the basis 
of recent insights regarding the path-
ophysiological mechanisms of VH in 
PD, we hypothesized a more broad, 
whole-network involvement instead of 
focal effects. Therefore, our aim was to 
gain insight into the pathophysiological 
mechanisms of VH in PD by analyzing 
whole-brain 
resting-state 
functional 
connectivity in PD + VH and PD 2 VH 
patients and control participants.
Materials and Methods
Participants
Patients and control participants were 
part of a previous cohort study (13) of de 
novo to moderately advanced idiopathic 
PD patients and healthy volunteers, of 
which the recruitment and inclusion is 
described elsewhere (13,14). Briefly, 
PD patients were initially recruited from 
an outpatient clinic for movement disor-
ders, and a group of healthy control par-
ticipants was composed of spouses of the 
patients and other healthy volunteers of 
comparable age. PD patients fulfilled the 
clinical diagnostic criteria of the United 
Kingdom Parkinson Disease Brain Bank 
(15). Exclusion criteria for PD patients 
were stereotactic surgery in the past and 
extensive white matter lesions or other 
abnormalities (eg, tumor) at magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging. The control 
group consisted of self-declared healthy 
participants, and they were screened 
for neuroradiologic disorders (ie, neu-
rologic symptoms were evaluated and

Advances in Knowledge
 
n Patients with Parkinson disease 
(PD) who have visual hallucina-
tions (VHs) show a widespread 
loss of functional connectivity, 
including frontal, temporal, oc-
cipital, and striatal brain regions 
(P , .05, false discovery rate 
corrected).
 
n Functional connectivity alter-
ations of these regions are re-
lated to cognitive impairments 
previously implicated in the path-
ophysiological mechanisms of VH 
in PD (eg, deficits in attention, 
attentional set shifting, and per-
ception; P , .05).
Implication for Patient Care
 
n This study provided insights into 
the functional substrates of VH 
in patients with PD and may 
offer future markers to predict 
the occurrence of VH in patients 
with PD.
V
isual hallucinations (VHs) are a 
frequent and disabling symptom 
in Parkinson disease (PD). Effec-
tive therapeutic strategies have been 
hindered by an incomplete knowledge 
of their pathophysiological mecha-
nisms (1). The current hypotheses on 
the pathophysiological causes of VH 
in patients with PD include disturbed 
attention and disturbed perception as 
contributory mechanisms, which sug-
gests the involvement of multiple brain 
regions and networks (2). In previous 
structural imaging studies, regional at-
rophy has been reported in PD patients 
with VH (hereafter, PD + VH patients) 
(3) compared with those without VH 
(hereafter, PD 2 VH patients), al-
though the observed localization of the 
atrophy appears inconsistent and may 
even be lacking altogether according to 
others (4). Interestingly, whereas at-
rophy seems to be mild in PD, there 
were reports of extensive decreases in 
functional connectivity between brain 
areas in PD, which relate strongly to 
clinical parameters (5) and perhaps to 
VH, which was shown in other neuro-
psychiatric diseases (6).
Functional MR imaging studies (7–
10) that specifically investigate VH in 
PD were mainly limited to task-based 
paradigms such as visual stimulation 
or cognitive tasks. However, because 
the presence of VH is strongly linked 
to the development of cognitive decline 
in PD, cognitive deficits may have had

standard space but FIRST is performed 
on native-space images, average cortical 
time series were extracted after bound-
ary-based registration (part of FSL) 
and nonlinear registration of the pre-
processed functional MR imaging data 
to standard space. Average deep gray 
matter time series of FIRST regions 
were extracted in subject space, only by 
using an inversed boundary-based reg-
istration matrix of the FIRST atlas from 
three-dimensional T1-weighted images 
to functional MR imaging space. This 
resulted in an individualized atlas that 
featured 93 regions of interest.
Functional MR Image Processing: 
Functional Connectivity
Average time series were calculated for 
each region of interest, and functional 
connectivity was then computed for 
all pair-wise combinations of brain re-
gions by using SL in BrainWave (version 
0.9.101; http://home.kpn.nl/stam7883/
brainwave.html), with SL values that 
ranged between 0 and 1. SL is a method 
previously used in the same cohort and 
is based on the concept of generalized 
synchronization, detecting both linear 
and nonlinear dependencies between 
two signals, whereas conventional corre-
lations only detect linear effects (20,21). 
An embedding dimension of five data 
points, a time lag of one data point, and 
a reference P value of .05 were used, 
which was in line with previous work 
(5). We took the mean SL value per con-
nectivity matrix (ie, the mean connec-
tivity of all regions in one patient) as a 
measure of whole-brain mean functional 
connectivity per patient. For the analysis 
of regional functional connectivity, we 
calculated the mean SL value (ie, the 
weighted degree) for each brain region, 
where left- and right-sided homologous 
brain regions were averaged to limit the 
number of comparisons, when applica-
ble, which left 47 regions for statistical 
analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive variables were compared 
between groups by using the Fisher ex-
act test for categorical data, the inde-
pendent t test for normally distributed 
continuous data, or the Mann Whitney 
HDXT, V15M; GE Healthcare, Wauke-
sha, Wis) by using a sagittal three-
dimensional T1-weighted fast spoiled 
gradient-echo sequence (repetition time 
msec/echo time msec, 7.8/3.0; inversion 
time msec, 450; flip angle, 12°; 1.0 3 0.9 
3 0.9 mm voxel size). For resting-state 
functional MR imaging, 202 volumes of 
axial echo-planar images were acquired, 
of which the first two were discarded 
(1800/35; flip angle, 90°; 3.3-mm isotro-
pic voxel size). Participants were asked 
to rest with their eyes closed, not asleep, 
and to think of nothing in particular dur-
ing the functional MR examination. Im-
aging was performed in the “on” medica-
tion state (ie, period during the day when 
treatment was effective at suppressing 
motor symptoms, as confirmed by the 
patient).
Functional MR Image Processing: Regions 
of Interest
Processing steps were performed 
(M.M.S., K.T.E.O.D., and D.H.H., with 
10, 10, and 4 years of experience in neu-
roimaging, respectively) by using FSL 
software (FMRIB Software Library, Ox-
ford, England; http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.
uk.fsl). Preprocessing steps included 
brain extraction and brain volume cal-
culation (normalized for head size) by 
using SIENAX (part of FSL) on the 
structural images and motion correc-
tion, smoothing, and high-pass filtering 
 
(100-second cutoff) and registration to 
standard space on the functional images 
with the pipeline of MELODIC (part of 
FSL). Participant motion, measured as 
relative displacement, was compara-
ble between PD patients (mean, 0.09 
mm 6 0.05 [standard deviation]) and 
control participants (mean, 0.10 mm 6 
0.07; U = 419; P = .931) and between 
PD + VH patients (mean, 0.09 mm 6 
0.05) and PD 2 VH patients (mean, 
0.09 mm 6 0.05; U = 286; P = .783). 
We assessed functional connectivity be-
tween 93 regions of interest covering 
the entire brain by using synchroniza-
tion likelihood (SL). Cortical regions 
of interest were derived from the Au-
tomated Anatomic Labeling (referred 
to as AAL) atlas (19) and subcortical 
regions were derived from FIRST (part 
of FSL). Because the AAL is situated in 
of motor symptoms was evaluated with 
the Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating 
Scale part III (17), which was obtained 
in the on-medication state by a trained 
physician (K.T.E.O.D. and D.H.H., with 
10 and 7 years of experience in neurol-
ogy, respectively). A disease stage ac-
cording to Hoehn and Yahr staging was 
attributed to each patient. Educational 
level was classified according to the In-
ternational Standard Classification of 
Education, ranging from a score of 0 (no 
primary education) to 6 (university edu-
cation). In addition, the levodopa equiv-
alent daily dose was calculated for each 
patient as described elsewhere (13), and 
the use of other medication that may 
facilitate the development of hallucina-
tions in PD (ie, dopamine agonists, neu-
roleptics, anticholinergics, amantadine, 
and monoamine oxidase B [known as 
MAO-B] inhibitors) was noted.
Cognitive Assessment
Cognitive status was evaluated by using 
the Mini-Mental State Examination and 
the Cambridge Cognitive Examination 
revised test battery, which allows for 
assessment of the following seven cog-
nitive domains: orientation (maximum 
score, 10), language (maximum score, 
30), memory (maximum score, 27), 
attention and calculation (maximum 
score, 9), praxis (maximum score, 12), 
abstract thinking (maximum score, 8), 
and perception (maximum score, 9). A 
total Cambridge Cognitive Examination 
revised test score below 80 is consid-
ered indicative of dementia (maximum 
total score, 105) (18). In addition, the 
following specific cognitive tests were 
performed: the semantic fluency test, 
the pattern recognition memory test, 
the spatial span test, the spatial work-
ing memory test, and the intra-extra 
dimensional set shift test from the 
Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Au-
tomated Battery (CANTAB Eclipse 2.0; 
Cambridge Cognition, Cambridge, Eng-
land) and the Vienna perseveration test 
from the Vienna Test System (Dr G. 
Schuhfried GmbH, Modling, Austria).
Image Acquisition
All participants underwent structural 
whole-brain 3-T MR imaging (Signa

revised test; semantic fluency; and 
working memory (ie, spatial span and 
spatial working memory; Table 2). 
 
Additional trend level differences were 
found for attention, praxis, and motor 
perseveration (Vienna perseveration test; 
Table 2). Normalized brain volumes were 
comparable between PD patients (mean, 
1.41 L 6 0.08) and control participants 
(mean, 1.42 L 6 0.09; t[68] = 0.46; P 
= .649) and between PD + VH patients 
(mean, 1.39 L 6 0.07) and PD 2 VH 
patients (mean, 1.42 L 6 0.09; t[53] = 
0.99; P = .328).
Functional Connectivity in Both Disease 
Groups
Whole-brain mean functional connec-
tivity was significantly different between 
groups of PD patients and control partic-
ipants (P = .013). Post hoc comparisons 
between groups showed only significantly 
Cognitive Examination revised test (U = 
194; P = .004), but Mini-Mental State 
Examination scores were comparable 
(U = 362; P = .721). By comparing PD + 
VH and PD 2 VH patients, disease du-
ration was similar in both groups (t[53] 
 
= 20.61; P = .547), and motor perfor-
mance (Unified Parkinson’s Disease 
Rating Scale part III; t[53] = 22.26; P 
= .028) and global cognitive functioning 
(Cambridge Cognitive Examination re-
vised test; U = 165; P = .011) were worse 
in PD + VH patients. Four PD + VH pa-
tients and two PD 2 VH patients were 
classified as demented (Fisher exact test, 
P = .041). By exploring cognitive func-
tions in more detail, PD + VH patients 
performed significantly worse than PD 
2 VH patients in multiple cognitive do-
mains, namely the orientation, language, 
memory, and perception subdomains of 
the Cambridge Cognitive Examination 
U test for nonnormally distributed con-
tinuous data when appropriate. We ap-
plied a reciprocal transformation to all 
SL values (ie, 1/SL) to obtain a normal 
distribution. A general linear model that 
controlled for age, sex, and educational 
level (dichotomized by using a median 
split) was used to compare the whole-
brain mean and regional functional con-
nectivity of all 47 brain regions between 
the three groups (PD + VH patients, PD 
2 VH patients, and control participants) 
with false discovery rate control for the 
number of statistical comparisons. Of all 
regions that were significantly altered in 
the main effect, post hoc comparisons 
between groups were performed with 
a Bonferroni correction for multiple 
group comparisons. The Pearson and 
Spearman correlation coefficients were 
used to evaluate the relation between 
SL values and disease duration and mo-
tor performance and global cognitive 
performance (Cambridge Cognitive Ex-
amination revised test). For regions in 
which the SL value was related to global 
cognitive performance in PD + VH pa-
tients, the Spearman correlation coeffi-
cient was used to explore correlations 
with specific cognitive subdomains (ie, 
Cambridge Cognitive Examination re-
vised test subdomains and additional 
cognitive tests). A two-tailed P value of 
less than .05 was considered to indicate 
statistical significance. All mentioned 
analyses were performed by using a sta-
tistical package (IBM Statistical Package 
of the Social Sciences software version 
20.0; SPSS, Chicago, Ill).
Results
Descriptive and Clinical Data
There were no significant differences in 
sex distribution, age, or educational level 
between patients with PD and control 
participants (Table 1). Relevant med-
ication use (levodopa equivalent daily 
dose, dopamine agonists, neuroleptics, 
anticholinergics, amantadine, and mono-
amine oxidase inhibitors) was similar in 
PD + VH patients and PD 2 VH patients. 
Global cognitive functioning was lower in 
PD patients compared with control par-
ticipants when measured with Cambridge

with lower cognitive test scores in the 
praxis (ρ = 20.595; P = .019) and per-
ception (ρ = 20.566; P = .028) subdo-
mains. Regional reductions in functional 
connectivity in PD + VH patients were 
not related to motor performance, and 
only lower functional connectivity of the 
putamen was related to shorter disease 
duration (Pearson correlation coeffi-
cient, r = 20.522; P = .046).
Discussion
We investigated whole-brain resting-
state functional connectivity in PD pa-
tients with and without VH and control 
participants by using functional MR 
imaging. We found significantly lower 
functional connectivity in PD patients, 
which was especially widespread in PD 
+ VH patients. Regions with lower func-
tional connectivity in both PD + VH and 
PD 2 VH patients was composed of the 
occipital and paracentral regions. In PD 
+ VH patients, nine additional regions 
with lower functional connectivity were 
found that involved the frontal, tempo-
ral, occipital, and striatal brain areas. 
Functional connectivity in these re-
gions was partially related to cognitive 
impairments (eg, deficits in attention, 
attentional set shifting, and percep-
tion). Our findings suggest that a more 
distributed loss of network efficiency 
contributes to the pathophysiological 
mechanisms of VH in PD patients.
The frontal and temporal brain re-
gions that were less well connected in 
our PD + VH patients are important 
for maintaining a normal level of atten-
tion. In particular, the superior frontal 
gyrus is involved in the allocation and 
maintenance of visuospatial attention 
and inhibitory control (22,23) and sup-
posedly allows an individual to reflect 
upon sensory experiences and judge 
their possible significance in relation to 
 
the self (24). The superior temporal gy-
rus has an important role in visual atten-
tion as well, and it is believed to control 
the ventral (ie, nonspatial) and dorsal (ie, 
spatial) visual streams (25). In this study, 
resting-state functional connectivity of 
the superior frontal gyrus and superior 
temporal gyrus was exclusively lower in 
PD + VH patients, which supports the 
control participants in PD + VH only. 
These were situated in the frontal cor-
tex (superior frontal gyrus), temporal 
cortex (fusiform gyrus, superior tempo-
ral gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, and 
middle temporal pole), rolandic opercu-
lum, occipital cortex (inferior occipital 
gyrus), and striatum (caudate nucleus 
and putamen; Fig 2). Reduced functional 
connectivity levels were only related to 
cognitive deficits, although these corre-
lations did not survive false discovery 
rate correction. A lower level of func-
tional connectivity of the superior tem-
poral gyrus and rolandic operculum was 
related to poorer cognitive functioning in 
PD + VH patients (ρ = 20.601, P = .018; 
and ρ = 20.539, P = .038, respectively). 
Exploring the relationship between func-
tional connectivity of the superior tem-
poral gyrus and cognitive domains in 
more detail, connectivity was correlated 
with orientation (ρ = 20.602; P = .017), 
attention (ρ = 20.555; P = .032), praxis 
(ρ = 20.636; P = .011), perception (ρ 
= 20.550; P = .033), and intraextra di-
mensional set shifting (ρ = 20.556; P = 
.049). The loss of functional connectiv-
ity of the rolandic operculum correlated 
lower whole-brain mean functional con-
nectivity in PD + VH patients compared 
with control participants (P = .010) and 
not between PD 2 VH patients and con-
trol participants (P = .140) nor between 
PD + VH patients and PD 2 VH patients 
(P = .339; Fig 1). Regional connectiv-
ity analysis showed eight regions in the 
occipital lobe and paracentral area in 
which functional connectivity (weighted 
degree) was lower in both PD + VH 
patients and PD 2 VH patients com-
pared with control participants (Fig 2). 
 
Functional connectivity was related to 
disease duration or motor performance 
in none of these eight regions. A lower 
level of functional connectivity of the 
paracentral lobule (ρ = 20.294; P = 
.029), the precentral gyrus (ρ = 20.275; 
P = .042), the calcarine cortex (ρ = 
20.270; P = .046), the superior occipital 
gyrus (ρ = 20.298; P = .027), and cune-
us (ρ = 20.268, P = .048) was related to 
worse cognitive function in PD patients.

size (only 15 PD + VH patients) the re-
sults should be interpreted with caution. 
However, to our knowledge, all previous 
functional MR imaging studies in PD 
patients with VH were performed with 
even smaller sample sizes (7–10,12). 
Moreover, we corrected for multiple 
comparisons between groups and pri-
mary outcome measures, thus reducing 
the risk of false-positive findings. The 
correlation analyses between functional 
connectivity and cognitive functions 
should be regarded as exploratory, how-
ever, because the correlations would 
not survive a correction for multiple 
comparisons. Second, although our PD 
patient groups had similar disease dura-
tions, the group of PD + VH patients was 
more severely affected compared with 
the group of PD 2 VH patients in terms 
of motor and cognitive performance. A 
more widespread loss of functional con-
nectivity in our group of PD + VH pa-
tients may thus reflect more advanced 
disease independent of the presence of 
VH. However, the absence of a relation-
ship between connectivity measures and 
clinical measures of disease progression 
(ie, disease duration and motor func-
tion) argue against this. Also, the brain 
regions that were exclusively altered in 
our group of PD + VH patients were 
different than the regions that were 
strongly related to cognitive decline in 
attentional processing in PD + VH pa-
tients, as shown in previous neuropsy-
chologic studies (32,33).
Besides disconnection of frontal, 
temporal, and striatal regions, we ob-
served weaker functional connectivity of 
the fusiform gyrus and inferior occipital 
gyrus in PD + VH patients. These regions 
are part of the ventral visual stream and 
are important for object and facial rec-
ognition (34). Reduced activation and 
metabolism in the visual pathways, in-
cluding the ventral visual stream, were 
previously observed in functional MR 
imaging, PET, and SPECT studies that 
compared PD + VH patients and PD 2 
VH patients (7,8,29,35,36). Therefore, 
the results of previous studies and our 
study suggest that relative impairments 
of so-called bottom-up visual processing 
in the occipitotemporal cortex may con-
tribute to the pathophysiological mech-
anisms of VH in PD. Possibly, as sug-
gested by others (26), impaired visual 
perception combined with defective at-
tentional processes results in the release 
of incorrect so-called proto-object, and 
hence leads to VH. Thus, a combina-
tion of disturbed visual and attentional 
networks (ie, disturbed bottom-up and 
top-down processes) may provoke VH 
in PD.
Our study has limitations. First, be-
cause our study had a limited sample 
hypothesis that disturbed attention (ie, 
disturbed “top-down” processing) plays 
a role in the generation of VH (26). 
Disconnection of frontal and temporal 
brain areas may contribute to disturbed 
so-called source monitoring, that is, im-
paired discrimination of external percep-
tions from internally generated informa-
tion, which has been reported in pPD + 
VH patients and not in PD 2 VH patients 
(27). PD + VH patients were more likely 
to report internally generated stimuli as 
external input stimuli, and VH in these 
patients could thus be the result of en-
dogenous imagery (27).
Even though we studied functional 
connectivity but not activation levels, 
the results of previous functional MR 
imaging studies that investigated brain 
activation during complex visual tasks 
in PD + VH patients and PD 2 VH pa-
tients are in line with the present find-
ings by showing frontal hypoactivation 
preceding and during image recognition 
in PD + VH patients (8,10). Further-
more, altered metabolism in frontal 
and temporal cortex has been observed 
in PD + VH patients by using positron 
emission tomography (PET) and single-
photon emission computed tomography 
(SPECT) (28–30). Moreover, Park et al 
(29) showed the strongest correlations 
between hallucination scores in PD pa-
tients and hypometabolism in the supe-
rior temporal gyrus and fusiform gyrus. 
In a recent study (31), the activity and 
connectivity of the dorsal attention net-
work, which includes the superior fron-
tal gyrus and striatum as neural hubs, 
were impaired in PD + VH patients, 
which is in line with our findings.
In this study, resting-state func-
tional connectivity in PD + VH patients 
was partially associated with cognitive 
function but unrelated to motor per-
formance. Specifically, a lower level 
of functional connectivity of superior 
temporal gyrus and rolandic operculum 
was associated with poorer test scores 
in multiple cognitive domains, including 
attention, perception, and intraextra di-
mensional set shifting, the latter reflect-
ing impaired visual discrimination and 
maintenance, shifting, and flexibility of 
attention. Again, this observation em-
phasizes the importance of disturbed 
Figure 1
Figure 1: Box-and-whisker plot shows mean functional 
connectivity in patient groups with PD and control participants. 
Patients with PD + VH had significantly lower mean functional 
connectivity (ie, higher SL values) compared with control partici-
pants, whereas mean functional connectivity in patients with PD 
2 VH and control participants was not significantly different.

fore, our findings argue against the no-
tion that a single specific functional brain 
region or network is the neural substrate 
of VH in PD, but rather supply further 
evidence for a more global loss of net-
work efficiency, which could drive dis-
turbed attentional and visual processing 
and thereby lead to VH in PD.

We explored the exclusiveness of these 
alterations by using a post hoc explor-
atory analysis in which we matched PD 
+ VH patients closely to individual PD 
2 VH patients, which ensured more 
comparable motor and cognitive perfor-
mance, and we obtained similar results 
(Appendix E1 [online]). The results of 
this exploratory analysis again empha-
size that our connectivity findings do not 
reflect disease progression, but seem to 
be uniquely related to the presence of 
VH. Finally, it is important to note that 
the on-medication state of our patients 
may have influenced our findings by 
normalizing functional connectivity and 
therefore masking further differences 
(37). However, imaging during the on-
medication state was necessary to mini-
mize the effect of head motion and thus 
motion-related artifacts during acquisi-
tion of MR images.
In summary, we found reduced func-
tional connectivity specific to PD + VH
