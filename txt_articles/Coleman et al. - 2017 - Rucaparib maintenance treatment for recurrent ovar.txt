 Background—Rucaparib, a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor, has anticancer activity in 
recurrent ovarian carcinoma harbouring a BRCA mutation or high percentage of genome-wide 
loss of heterozygosity. In this trial we assessed rucaparib versus placebo after response to second-
line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with high-grade, recurrent, platinum-
sensitive ovarian carcinoma.
Methods—In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we recruited 
patients from 87 hospitals and cancer centres across 11 countries. Eligible patients were aged 18 
years or older, had a platinum-sensitive, high-grade serous or endometrioid ovarian, primary 
peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma, had received at least two previous platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimens, had achieved complete or partial response to their last platinum-based 
regimen, had a cancer antigen 125 concentration of less than the upper limit of normal, had a 
performance status of 0–1, and had adequate organ function. Patients were ineligible if they had 
symptomatic or untreated central nervous system metastases, had received anticancer therapy 14 
days or fewer before starting the study, or had received previous treatment with a poly(ADP-
ribose) polymerase inhibitor. We randomly allocated patients 2:1 to receive oral rucaparib 600 mg 
twice daily or placebo in 28 day cycles using a computer-generated sequence (block size of six, 
stratified by homologous recombination repair gene mutation status, progression-free interval after 
the penultimate platinum-based regimen, and best response to the most recent platinum-based 
regimen). Patients, investigators, site staff, assessors, and the funder were masked to assignments. 
The primary outcome was investigator-assessed progression-free survival evaluated with use of an 
ordered step-down procedure for three nested cohorts: patients with BRCA mutations (carcinoma 
associated with deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutations), patients with homologous 
recombination deficiencies (BRCA mutant or BRCA wild-type and high loss of heterozygosity), 
and the intention-to-treat population, assessed at screening and every 12 weeks thereafter. This 
trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01968213; enrolment is complete.
Findings—Between April 7, 2014, and July 19, 2016, we randomly allocated 564 patients: 375 
(66%) to rucaparib and 189 (34%) to placebo. Median progression-free survival in patients with a 
BRCA-mutant carcinoma was 16·6 months (95% CI 13·4–22·9; 130 [35%] patients) in the 
rucaparib group versus 5·4 months (3·4–6·7; 66 [35%] patients) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 
0·23 [95% CI 0·16–0·34]; p<0·0001). In patients with a homologous recombination deficient 
carcinoma (236 [63%] vs 118 [62%]), it was 13·6 months (10·9–16·2) versus 5·4 months (5·1–5·6; 
0·32 [0·24–0·42]; p<0·0001). In the intention-to-treat population, it was 10·8 months (8·3–11·4) 
versus 5·4 months (5·3–5·5; 0·36 [0·30–0·45]; p<0·0001). Treatment-emergent adverse events of 
grade 3 or higher in the safety population (372 [99%] patients in the rucaparib group vs 189 
[100%] in the placebo group) were reported in 209 (56%) patients in the rucaparib group versus 28 
(15%) in the placebo group, the most common of which were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin 
concentration (70 [19%] vs one [1%]) and increased alanine or aspartate aminotransferase 
concentration (39 [10%] vs none).
Interpretation—Across all primary analysis groups, rucaparib significantly improved 
progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a 
response to platinum-based chemotherapy. ARIEL3 provides further evidence that use of a 
poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor in the maintenance treatment setting versus placebo could 
be considered a new standard of care for women with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer following 
a complete or partial response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy.

Introduction
Ovarian cancer is the eighth-leading cause of death from cancer in women worldwide.1 Most 
patients with advanced-stage ovarian carcinoma initially receive platinum-based 
chemotherapy and achieve a clinical response; however, most of these patients will 
ultimately relapse.2 Treatment for initial recurrent disease depends on many factors, 
including duration of initial treatment response, antecedent and persistent adverse events, 
performance status, histology, location and burden of disease, and, increasingly, tumour 
genomics, such as BRCA mutation status.3 For patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent 
ovarian carcinoma, maintenance treatment with targeted agents has resulted in greater 
prolongation of progression-free survival than without this treatment.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 However, 
clinical benefit is typically transient, hence the pursuit continues for new therapies and tools 
to identify patients who might benefit most from these therapies, as well as to identify the 
optimal therapeutic strategy.
The poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor rucaparib is approved in the USA for 
treatment of patients with deleterious BRCA mutation (germline or somatic)-associated 
advanced ovarian carcinoma who have received two or more chemotherapy regimens. 
Approval of rucaparib was based on the proportion of patients with an objective response 
(57 [54%] of 106 patients) observed in a pooled population of patients with BRCA-mutant 
high-grade ovarian carcinoma from the Study 1010 and ARIEL211 clinical trials.
In part 1 of the ARIEL2 trial,11 rucaparib treatment was found to be efficacious not only in 
patients with relapsed, platinum-sensitive, high-grade ovarian carcinoma with a BRCA 
mutation, but also in those with BRCA wild-type carcinomas with high genomic loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH), a potential marker of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) 
and thus PARP inhibitor activity.12, 13, 14, 15 The next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay 
used in ARIEL2 combines mutation analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes with 
measurement of the percentage of genome-wide LOH in the cancer tissue as a biomarker for 
sensitivity to rucaparib treatment. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
phase 3 trial (ARIEL3), our objective was to assess the efficacy and safety of rucaparib 
versus placebo after response to second-line or later platinum-based chemotherapy in 
patients with high-grade, platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma (including fallopian tube and 
primary peritoneal carcinomas) and prospectively test the genomic LOH cutoff discriminator 
that was optimised on the basis of results of ARIEL2 part 1 as a predictive biomarker for 
sensitivity to rucaparib treatment.
Methods
Study design and patients
In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial, we recruited patients 
from 87 hospitals and cancer centres in Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, 
Israel, Italy, New Zealand, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Eligible patients were aged 18 years 
or older, had platinum-sensitive (ie, documented radiological disease progression more than

 6 months after the last dose of the penultimate platinum administered), high-grade serous or 
endometrioid ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma and had received at 
least two previous platinum-based chemotherapy regimens. We permitted previous treatment 
with bevacizumab, with the exception of bevacizumab maintenance treatment after the most 
recent platinum-based regimen. On Nov 4, 2014, after 91 patients had been randomly 
allocated, we made an amendment to the protocol requiring that the most recent platinum-
based regimen was to be administered as a chemotherapy doublet and for a minimum of four 
cycles. Patients must have achieved either a complete response according to the Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.116 or a partial response, defined as 
either a RECIST partial response or a serological response according to Gynecologic Cancer 
InterGroup (GCIG) cancer antigen 125 (CA 125)17 response criteria, to their last platinum-
based regimen. For patients who achieved a partial response, we placed no restriction on 
residual carcinoma size at study entry; we defined those who had persistent lesions of 
greater than 2 cm as established by independent radiological review as having bulky residual 
disease. Responses must have been maintained through completion of chemotherapy and 
during the interval period between completion of chemotherapy and entry into the trial. 
Additionally, we required CA 125 to be less than the upper limit of normal. Patients had an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0–1 and adequate organ 
function. Patients were ineligible if they had symptomatic or untreated central nervous 
system metastases, received anticancer therapy 14 days or fewer before starting the study, or 
received previous treatment with a PARP inhibitor. A complete list of inclusion and 
exclusion criteria is provided in the appendix (pp 6–7).
The trial was approved by national or local institutional review boards and carried out in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice Guidelines of the 
International Conference on Harmonisation. Patients provided written informed consent 
before participation.
Randomisation and masking
Within 8 weeks of their last dose of platinum, we randomly allocated eligible patients 2:1 to 
receive rucaparib or placebo. Randomisation was computer generated by Almac Clinical 
Technologies (Souderton, PA, USA) using a block size of six. Randomisation stratification 
factors included homologous recombination repair gene mutation status (based on gene 
mutation only; mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2, mutation in a non-BRCA gene associated 
with homologous recombination, or no mutation in BRCA or a homologous recombination 
gene; additional details in the appendix [p 3]); progression-free interval following 
penultimate platinum-based regimen (6–12 months or >12 months); and best response to 
most recent platinum-based regimen (complete or partial response). Patients were assigned 
to the rucaparib or placebo group in a masked manner with use of Almac Clinical 
Technologies’ interactive web and voice response system (IXRS); patients, investigators, site 
staff, assessors, and the funder were masked to assignments. To ensure masking was 
maintained, rucaparib and placebo tablets were manufactured to have identical appearances.

 Procedures
Central testing of DNA derived from patient archival tumour tissue samples was done to 
detect mutations in homologous recombination pathway genes (appendix p 8) and assess 
genomic LOH with use of Foundation Medicine’s T5 NGS assay (Cambridge, MA, USA). 
On the basis of retrospective analysis of data from ARIEL2 part 1,11 we prespecified a 
cutoff of 16% or greater for ARIEL3 as a discriminator for high genomic LOH. We 
identified germline mutations with a BRCAnalysis CDx test (Myriad Genetics, Salt Lake 
City, UT, USA). Further details of the tumour tissue testing are provided in the appendix (p 
2). The independent data monitoring committee surveyed enrolment of patients with a 
BRCA mutation and informed the funder when the target enrolment number for the BRCA-
mutant cohort was anticipated to be reached. Once notified, patients who were in the 
screening process were allowed to complete screening and enrol in the study if they met all 
eligibility criteria.
Patients received oral rucaparib (600 mg twice daily) or matched placebo in continuous 28 
day cycles until disease progression, death, or other reason for discontinuation. We 
permitted dose reductions (in decrements of 120 mg) if a patient had a grade 3 or greater or 
persistent grade 2 adverse event (additional details in the appendix [p 3]). We discontinued 
treatment for a toxicity-related treatment interruption lasting for more than 14 consecutive 
days (unless otherwise agreed on between the investigator and the funder).
We did disease assessments at screening, every 12 weeks during treatment (and after 
treatment for patients who discontinued for any reason other than disease progression), 
following clinical symptoms (eg, rising CA 125 levels, patient deterioration), and at 
treatment discontinuation. We established disease progression with RECIST. We only 
considered patients with a complete response at study entry to have disease progression if 
we identified an unequivocal new lesion. We did not consider increased CA 125 
concentrations alone to indicate disease progression unless confirmed by RECIST. We 
provided all computed tomography scans and other imaging to a blinded, independent, 
central radiology review (BICR). We used the National Comprehensive Cancer Network–
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Ovarian Symptom Index 18 (FOSI-18)18 
questionnaire to assess patient-reported outcomes at screening and throughout treatment.
Outcomes
The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed progression-free survival, defined as the 
time from randomisation to investigator-assessed disease progression according to RECIST 
or death. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival according to BICR, patient-
reported outcomes as assessed by time to worsening in the FOSI-18 disease-related 
symptoms–physical (DRS-P) subscale (defined as ≥4 point decrease) and total score 
(defined as ≥8 point decrease), overall survival, safety, and population pharmacokinetic 
modelling. Additional details are available in the appendix (p 3). The secondary endpoint of 
population pharmacokinetic modelling will be reported separately.
We assessed safety by monitoring for adverse events, laboratory testing, assessing vital 
signs, and physical examinations. We classified adverse events in accordance with the

 Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities classification system version 18.119 and 
graded for severity in accordance with the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.03.20 We classified serious adverse events as those that 
result in death, are immediately life-threatening, require admission to hospital or 
prolongation of an existing hospital stay, result in incapacity or disruption of the ability to 
carry out normal life functions, result in a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or are 
important medical events on the basis of appropriate medical judgment.
Statistical analysis
ARIEL3 was designed to enrol approximately 540 patients, including between 180 and 200 
with a BRCA mutation in their carcinoma (with no more than 150 with a known deleterious 
germline BRCA mutation) and no more than 360 without. We calculated these subgroup 
sizes to result in a 90% power to establish a significant difference between rucaparib and 
placebo at a one-sided α level of 0·025 given the following assumptions for investigator-
assessed median progression-free survival for the efficacy analysis cohorts: BRCA mutant 
(carcinoma associated with a deleterious germline or somatic BRCA mutation; 12·0 months 
in the rucaparib group vs 6·0 months in the placebo group; hazard ratio [HR] 0·5), HRD 
(BRCA-mutated carcinoma or BRCA wild-type and high-LOH carcinomas; 10·0 months vs 
6·0 months; HR 0·6), and the intention-to-treat population (all randomly allocated patients; 
8·5 months vs 6·0 months; HR 0·7). We classified HRD status in the carcinoma (on the basis 
of BRCA mutation or LOH) for the efficacy analysis before database lock and final efficacy 
analysis. The primary analysis was to be done after the independent data monitoring 
committee established that investigator-assessed disease progression or death had occurred 
in at least 70% of expected patients in the BRCA-mutant cohort.
We did all efficacy analyses for the intention-to-treat population. The efficacy analyses are 
presented separately for the nested cohorts: BRCA mutant, HRD, and the intention-to-treat 
population; we used an ordered step-down multiple comparisons procedure.21 We tested 
investigator-assessed progression-free survival in patients with a BRCA-mutant carcinoma 
first at a one-sided 0·025 significance level. Analysis of investigator-assessed progression-
free survival in patients with an HRD carcinoma followed by analysis in the intention-to-
treat population was contingent on a significant result in the analysis of patients with a 
BRCA-mutant carcinoma. Analysis of the key secondary endpoints of patient-reported 
outcomes and overall survival were to follow in a similar ordered step-down procedure. 
Once significance was not achieved for one test, significance was not declared for all 
subsequent analyses.
Progression-free survival by BICR was evaluated as a key stand-alone secondary endpoint, 
separate from the step-down procedure described above. We analysed time to progression-
free survival (by investigator and BICR) and to worsening according to the FOSI-18 DRS-P 
subscale using a stratified Kaplan-Meier method with which we compared distributions 
between the rucaparib and placebo groups using a stratified log-rank test. We used a 
stratified Cox proportional hazards model to estimate the HR between the groups. We 
verified the proportionality of hazards for the Cox proportional hazard assumption (ie, 
constant relative hazard) graphically using log-log plots. We did exploratory analyses of

 progression-free survival in subgroups based on patient characteristics (eg, randomisation 
stratification factors, demographics, and disease burden at baseline). For patients with 
measurable disease at study entry, the proportion of patients achieving a confirmed complete 
or partial response according to RECIST as assessed by the investigator was a prespecified 
exploratory endpoint. We assessed safety, including adverse events and clinical laboratory 
investigations, in all patients who received at least one dose of study treatment.
We did statistical analyses using SAS version 9.4. Additional details are available in the 
appendix (pp 4–5). The independent data monitoring committee monitored enrolment and 
reviewed the safety and efficacy of the trial approximately every 6 months, including 
maturity of progression-free survival events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, 
number NCT01968213; enrolment is complete.
Role of the funding source
The study was designed by the funder and the coordinating investigators (RLC and JAL). 
Data were collected by the investigators, analysed by the funder, and interpreted by all 
authors. All authors had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for 
the decision to submit for publication. Writing and editorial assistance were supported by 
the funder.
Results
Between April 7, 2014, and July 19, 2016, we randomly allocated 564 patients: 375 (66%) 
to rucaparib and 189 (34%) to placebo (figure 1, figure 2). At the visit cutoff date (April 15, 
2017), 90 (24%) patients in the rucaparib group and nine (5%) in the placebo group were 
still receiving treatment. Baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the 
treatment groups (table 1).
Following the ordered step-down multiple comparisons procedure, we evaluated 
investigator-assessed progression-free survival first in patients with a BRCA-mutant 
carcinoma (130 [35%] in the rucaparib group vs 66 [35%] in the placebo group, figure 2). 
Median progression-free survival was 16·6 months (95% CI 13·4–22·9) in the rucaparib 
group versus 5·4 months (3·4–6·7) in the placebo group (HR 0·23 [95% CI 0·16–0·34]; 
p<0·0001; figure 3). In patients with an HRD carcinoma (236 [63%] in the rucaparib group 
vs 118 [62%] in the placebo group), median progression-free survival was 13·6 months 
(10·9–16·2) versus 5·4 months (5·1–5·6; 0·32 [0·24–0·42]; p<0·0001). Median progression-
free survival in the intention-to-treat population was 10·8 months (8·3–11·4) in the rucuparib 
group versus 5·4 months in the placebo group (5·3–5·5; 0·36 [0·30–0·45]; p<0·0001).
In a prespecified analysis of the key stand-alone secondary endpoint of progression-free

 three nested cohorts, the plot of the log of the cumulative hazard for each treatment group 
resulted in parallel curves for both investigator-assessed and BICR-assessed progression-free 
survival, indicating that no violation of the proportionality of hazards assumption occurred 
(appendix pp 13–15). The probability of being progression free at 6, 12, and 18 months is in 
the appendix (p 9).
We analysed the secondary endpoint of time to worsening according to the FOSI-18 DRS-P 
subscale using the step-down procedure for the three nested subgroups. In patients with a 
BRCA-mutant carcinoma, we noted no significant difference between groups (HR 1·24 
[95% CI 0·82–1·86]; p=0·30). As significance was not reached in this group, in accordance 
with the prespecified step-down procedure, significance could not be established for the 
remaining secondary analyses. Patient-reported health outcomes will be shown in a 
secondary publication. At the visit cutoff date (April 15, 2017), overall survival data were 
not mature (81 [22%] patients in the rucaparib arm and 42 [22%] patients in the placebo arm 
had died). A follow-up analysis will be done when approximately 70% of patients have died 
(approximately 395 overall survival events).
Preplanned subgroup analyses of investigator-assessed progression-free survival showed that 
all clinical subgroups had a progression-free survival benefit for rucaparib versus placebo, 
irrespective of measurable or bulky disease at baseline, response to last platinum-based 
regimen, LOH, or BRCA mutation (figure 4, appendix p 16). Further supporting the efficacy 
observed in the intention-to-treat population, in the non-nested subgroups of patients with 
carcinomas that were BRCA wild-type, we observed an investigator-assessed progression-
free survival benefit with rucaparib in patients with high-LOH (median 9·7 months [95% CI 
7·9–13·1] vs 5·4 months [4·1–5·7]; HR 0·44 [95% CI 0·29–0·66]; p<0·0001) and low-LOH 
(6·7 months [5·4–9·1] vs 5·4 months [5·3–7·4]; 0·58 [0·40–0·85]; p=0·0049) carcinomas 
(figure 5, appendix p 9). We observed similar results for BICR-assessed progression-free 
survival, for which a benefit was also seen with rucaparib in patients with both high-LOH 
and low-LOH carcinomas (appendix p 17).
Most patients (374 [66%]) in ARIEL3 had achieved a partial response to platinum-based 
therapy before randomisation. For 207 (37%) of 564 patients with measurable disease per 
investigator at study entry, a prespecified exploratory analysis of confirmed response was 
done. In the subgroup of patients with measurable disease at study entry with a BRCA-
mutant carcinoma, the exploratory analysis showed that 15 (38% [95% CI 23–54]) of 40 
patients in the rucaparib group and two (9% [1–28]) of 23 in the placebo group achieved a 
confirmed RECIST response (appendix p 10). In patients with an HRD carcinoma, the 
objective response was also higher in the rucaparib group (23 [27% (18–38)] of 85 patients) 
than in the placebo group (three [7% (1–20)] of 41). We observed a similar result in the 
intention-to-treat population (26 [18% (12–26)] of 141 in the rucaparib group; five [8% (2–
17)] of 66 in the placebo group). We observed complete responses in the rucaparib group in 
seven (18%) patients with measurable disease at baseline in the nested BRCA-mutant 
cohort, ten (12%) in the HRD cohort, and ten (7%) in the intention-to-treat population. We 
only observed one (2%) complete response in the placebo group; this response occurred in 
the intention-to-treat population.

 The safety population included 372 (99%) patients who received rucaparib (three [1%] 
patients withdrew before receiving rucaparib) and 189 (100%) who received placebo. For the 
safety population, the median treatment duration was 8·3 months (IQR 3·4–16·1) in the 
rucaparib group and 5·5 months (2·8–8·3) in the placebo group. A treatment-emergent 
adverse event of any grade occurred in 372 (100%) patients in the rucaparib group and 182 
(96%) in the placebo group (table 2). The most common treatment-emergent adverse events 
(reported in at least 35% of patients in either group) were nausea, asthenia or fatigue, 
dysgeusia, anaemia or decreased haemoglobin concentration, constipation, and vomiting. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events of grade 3 or greater were reported in 209 (56%) 
patients in the rucaparib group and 28 (15%) in the placebo group, the most common of 
which were anaemia or decreased haemoglobin concentration and increase in alanine 
aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase concentration. For patients in the rucaparib 
group, a decline in haemoglobin concentration from baseline generally occurred in the first 
few cycles (appendix p 18). Elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate 
aminotransferase concentrations were generally transient, self-limiting, and not associated 
with other signs of liver toxicity (appendix pp 19–20).
One or more serious adverse events were reported in 78 (21%) patients in the rucaparib 
group and 20 (11%) in the placebo group. The most common serious adverse events 
(reported in at least 2% of patients in either group) were anaemia (16 [4%] patients in the 
rucaparib group vs one [1%] in the placebo group), pyrexia (six [2%] vs none), vomiting (six 
[2%] vs two [1%]), and small intestinal obstruction (three [1%] vs three [2%]).
Myelodysplastic syndrome and acute myeloid leukaemia were reported in three (1%) 
patients in the rucaparib group (two [1%] had a germline BRCA-mutant carcinoma and one 
[<1%] had a BRCA wild-type and low-LOH carcinoma). One (<1%) patient died from 
myelodysplastic syndrome and one (<1%) died from acute myeloid leukaemia. No patients 
reported myelodysplastic syndrome or acute myeloid leukaemia in the placebo group.
Treatment interruption due to a treatment-emergent adverse event occurred in 237 (64%) 
patients in the rucaparib group and 19 (10%) in the placebo group (appendix p 11). Dose 
reduction due to a treatment-emergent adverse event occurred in 203 (55%) patients in the 
rucaparib group and eight (4%) in the placebo group. 117 (31%) patients in the rucaparib 
group and six (3%) in the placebo group had both a treatment interruption and dose 
reduction due to a treatment-emergent adverse event. Of patients who received rucaparib, 50 
(13%) discontinued because of a treatment-emergent adverse event (excluding disease 
progression) compared with three (2%) patients in the placebo group (appendix p 12). As of 
the visit cutoff date, in the rucaparib group, four (1%) deaths occurred because of adverse 
events considered unrelated to treatment by the investigator (two [1%] patients due to 
progressive disease, one [<1%] due to cardiac arrest, and one [<1%] due to haematophagic 
histiocytosis) and two (1%) deaths occurred that were considered treatment related by the 
investigator (one [<1%] due to acute myeloid leukaemia and one [<1%] due to 
myelodysplastic syndrome). In the placebo group, two (1%) patients died because of adverse 
events considered unrelated to treatment by the investigator (one [1%] due to progressive 
disease and one [1%] due to pulmonary embolism).

 Discussion
Rucaparib maintenance treatment significantly improved progression-free survival compared 
with placebo in all primary analysis groups of patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma 
after a complete or partial response to platinum-based therapy, as well as when assessed by 
the BICR and across all prespecified subgroups. Analysis of non-nested, non-overlapping 
patient subpopulations indicate that the significant improvement in progression-free survival 
observed in the intention-to-treat population was not driven only by the results in the nested 
HRD or BRCA-mutant cohorts.
We observed no significant difference in time to worsening in the FOSI-18 DRS-P subscale 
between the rucaparib and placebo groups. Further analyses of the patient-reported health 
outcome data gathered in ARIEL3 are planned and will be reported separately. Overall 
survival data were not mature at the time of the visit cutoff, with approximately 22% of the 
events needed for final analysis. Patient follow-up is continuing in a masked manner and 
overall survival will be assessed after about 70% maturity is reached.
Treatment-emergent adverse events in the rucaparib group were generally managed with 
dose modifications and not associated with increased mortality or morbidity compared with 
the placebo group. As reported in previous studies of rucaparib and other PARP inhibitors,
5, 6, 9, 10, 11 gastrointestinal side-effects, asthenia or fatigue, and myelosuppression were 
common treatment-emergent adverse events in the rucaparib group. Management of adverse 
events included supportive care and dose modifications (including treatment interruption or 
dose reduction). Common laboratory abnormalities observed in the rucaparib group included 
elevations in alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase concentration and blood 
creatinine concentration. Alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase 
concentration increases were not associated with abnormal increases in bilirubin or other 
criteria for drug-induced hepatotoxicity and generally resolved over time. We considered no 
cases to meet Hy’s law criteria for drug-induced liver injury.22, 23 Similarly, elevations in 
creatinine, which have also been observed with olaparib,24 were self-limiting and stabilised 
over time. Creatinine is secreted into urine via renal transporters (eg, multidrug and toxin 
extrusion 1, multidrug and toxin extrusion 2-K, organic cation transporter 1, and organic 
cation transporter 2), which have been shown to be inhibited in vitro by multiple PARP 
inhibitors, including rucaparib,25 olaparib,26 and veliparib.27 Patterns of elevation and 
stabilisation of these laboratory abnormalities similar to those reported in this study were 
observed in the treatment setting with rucaparib.28, 29
The results of ARIEL3 are consistent with those of other placebo-controlled studies of 
PARP inhibitors in the maintenance treatment setting, including ENGOT-OV16/NOVA 
studying niraparib6 and Study 195, 30 and SOLO29 studying olaparib. However, direct 
comparisons with these other trials cannot be made because of differences in patient groups 
analysed (eg, SOLO2/ENGOT-Ov21 only enrolled patients with a germline BRCA 
mutation), definition of HRD (eg, in ENGOT-OV16/NOVA, HRD included patients with 
somatic mutations in BRCA and those with non-BRCA-related HRD), the method of 
primary endpoint assessment (eg, investigator vs BICR), and study design (eg, residual 
disease was restricted to <2 cm in ENGOT-OV16/NOVA).

 Although having a CA 125 concentration of less than the upper limit of normal is not a 
requirement of response according to GCIG CA 125 criteria or a RECIST partial response, 
ARIEL3 did have this requirement to ensure that patients had controlled disease at study 
entry. Similar restrictions on CA 125 concentrations were included in the enrolment criteria 
of other studies investigating PARP inhibitors in the maintenance treatment setting, although 
how many patients in these studies had CA 125 concentrations of greater than the upper 
limit of normal at study entry is unknown.5, 6, 9 Furthermore, whether or not inclusion of 
patients with CA 125 concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal affects the efficacy 
of PARP inhibitors in the maintenance treatment setting is also unknown.
Although ARIEL3 extends the findings of previous studies of PARP inhibitors in this 
setting, some important differences exist between this study and other studies in the 
maintenance treatment setting. Notably, patients in ARIEL3 with carcinomas associated 
with a germline or somatic BRCA mutation were both included in the three nested cohorts, a 
feature that is unique to ARIEL3 in this setting. Additionally, we did not restrict enrolment 
on the basis of target lesion size for patients with residual disease (partial response to 
previous platinum). A number of patients with measurable residual disease at study entry 
showed further reduction in carcinoma burden with rucaparib maintenance treatment, 
including conversion to a complete response.
ARIEL3 is, to our knowledge, the first phase 3 trial to prospectively assess the primary 
endpoint of progression-free survival in patients with recurrent ovarian carcinoma associated 
with HRD. Preplanned analysis of progression-free survival in patients with a BRCA wild-
type and high-LOH carcinoma—wherein patients receiving rucaparib had an increase in 
median progression-free survival compared with placebo—shows that the improvement 
observed in the HRD cohort was not driven solely by patients with a BRCA-mutant 
carcinoma. The benefit in progression-free survival seen in patients with a BRCA wild-type 
and high-LOH carcinoma compared with those with a BRCA wild-type and low-LOH 
carcinoma shows the use of HRD, in particular high genomic LOH as defined by Foundation 
Medicine’s T5 assay, as a predictive biomarker for sensitivity to rucaparib treatment.
ARIEL3 had several limitations. Use of a placebo might not be the most appropriate control 
group for patients who entered the study with a partial response to their prior platinum-based 
regimen. Additionally, there was the potential for bias with regard to investigator-assessment 
of progression-free survival (ie, investigators may have used other clinical markers unrelated 
to RECIST to evaluate disease progression, including use of rising CA 125 levels).
In ARIEL2 part 1,11 use of LOH helped discriminate which patients with platinum-sensitive 
ovarian carcinoma who received one or two prior lines of chemotherapy benefited from 
rucaparib; however, HRD assessment with genomic LOH was not completely predictive of 
clinical benefit because some patients with a BRCA wild-type and low-LOH carcinoma 
responded to rucaparib. Similarly, in ARIEL3, we also observed response to rucaparib in 
patients with a BRCA wild-type and low-LOH carcinoma, with more than 30% of patients 
in the rucaparib group achieving benefit of more than a year’s duration compared with less 
than 5% in the placebo group. Taken together, results from ARIEL2 in the treatment setting 
and ARIEL3 in the maintenance setting demonstrate that although HRD and genomic LOH

 can be an informative tool for clinicians making treatment decisions for patients with BRCA 
wild-type-associated platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma, the biomarker does not appear to 
be sufficiently precise to predict absence of benefit on an individual basis. As NGS-based 
assays become more common in routine clinical practice than at present, the cost-benefit 
ratio of use of these assays will need to be evaluated in the context of optimal response to 
preceding platinum therapy, the cost of maintenance therapy, and the potential magnitude of 
clinical benefit in a particular subgroup.

 Research in context
Evidence before this study
Evidence of the clinical effectiveness of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors 
as maintenance treatment for platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma is scarce. In a search 
of PubMed for articles published up to July 31, 2017, using the search terms (“PARP 
inhibitor” OR “rucaparib” OR “olaparib” OR “niraparib” OR “veliparib” OR 
“talazoparib”) AND (“ovarian” AND [“cancer” OR “carcinoma”] AND “maintenance”) 
with no language restrictions, we found that data have been published in a PubMed-
indexed journal for only three clinical trials. Study 19 and SOLO2/ENGOT-Ov21 showed 
that patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma who had received at least two 
previous platinum-based chemotherapies had significantly improved progression-free 
survival with olaparib maintenance treatment, and results from the ENGOT-OV16/NOVA 
trial showed that niraparib also showed a significant improvement.
Added value of this study
ARIEL3 is, to our knowledge, the first phase 3 trial to prospectively assess progression-
free survival in patients with recurrent platinum-sensitive ovarian carcinoma who 
achieved a response to platinum-based therapy associated with homologous 
recombination deficiency (HRD) as a primary endpoint. We enrolled patients with or 
without a germline or somatic BRCA mutation, and the size of residual disease was not 
restricted. Our results show that rucaparib maintenance treatment significantly improved 
progression-free survival for patients across all primary analysis groups, not only for 
patients with ovarian carcinoma associated with a BRCA mutation, but also for those 
with BRCA wild-type ovarian carcinoma. A novel aspect of this trial was the prospective 
validation of the tumour-based, next-generation sequencing HRD assay that was used in 
the phase 2 ARIEL2 trial. Additionally, an exploratory analysis of progression-free 
survival in patients with BRCA wild-type and high loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or low 
LOH tumours revealed that patients with BRCA-mutant tumours did not solely drive 
rucaparib benefit in the HRD cohort or intention-to-treat population. Furthermore, an 
improvement in progression-free survival (assessed by investigator or a masked 
independent central radiology review committee) versus placebo was maintained in the 
BRCA wild-type and high LOH or low LOH groups.
Implications of all the available evidence
Combined with the evidence from previous studies, our study supports use of PARP 
inhibitors, such as rucaparib, as maintenance treatment for patients with platinum-
sensitive ovarian cancer who achieved a response to platinum-based chemotherapy. Our 
results show that HRD as a predictive biomarker can be an informative tool for clinicians 
when making treatment decisions for this patient population. The targeted agents 
bevacizumab and cediranib have also proven useful in extending progression-free 
survival for patients in this setting. Our findings strengthen the rationale for continued 
investigation of targeted therapies, such as PARP inhibitors, for maintenance treatment as
