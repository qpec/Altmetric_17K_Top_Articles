IMPORTANCE Medicare payment initiatives are spurring efforts to reduce potentially
avoidable hospitalizations.
OBJECTIVE To determine whether training and support for implementation of a nursing home
(NH) quality improvement program (Interventions to Reduce Acute Care Transfers
[INTERACT]) reduced hospital admissions and emergency department (ED) visits.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This analysis compared changes in hospitalization and
ED visit rates between the preintervention and postintervention periods for NHs randomly
assigned to receive training and implementation support on INTERACT to changes in control
NHs. The analysis focused on 85 NHs (36 717 NH residents) that reported no use of INTERACT
during the preintervention period.
INTERVENTIONS The study team provided training and support for implementing INTERACT,
which included tools that help NH staff identify and evaluate acute changes in NH resident
condition and document communication between physicians; care paths to avoid
hospitalization when safe and feasible; and advance care planning and quality
improvement tools.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES All-cause hospitalizations, hospitalizations considered
potentially avoidable, 30-day hospital readmissions, and ED visits without admission.
All-cause hospitalization rates were calculated for all resident-days, high-risk days (0-30 days
after NH admission), and lower-risk days (�31 days after NH admission).
RESULTS We found that of 85 NHs, those that received implementation training and support
exhibited statistically nonsignificant reductions in hospitalization rates compared with
control NHs (net difference, −0.13 per 1000 resident-days; P = .25), hospitalizations during
the first 30 days after NH admission (net difference, −0.37 per 1000 resident-days; P = .48),
hospitalizations during periods more than 30 days after NH admission (net difference, −0.09
per 1000 resident-days; P = .39), 30-day readmission rates (net change in rate among
hospital discharges, −0.01; P = .36), and ED visits without admission (net difference, 0.02 per
1000 resident-days; P = .83). Intervention NHs exhibited a reduction in potentially avoidable
hospitalizations overall (net difference, −0.18 per 1000 resident-days, P = .01); however, this
effect was not robust to a Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Training and support for INTERACT implementation as carried
out in this study had no effect on hospitalization or ED visit rates in the overall population of
residents in participating NHs. The results have several important implications for
implementing quality improvement initiatives in NHs.

olicy makers are increasingly focused on the high rate
ofhospitalizationsandemergencydepartment(ED)vis-
its in the nursing home (NH) population.1-3 Approxi-
mately20%to25%ofNHadmissionsarereadmittedtothehos-
pital within 30 days.4 A substantial percentage of these
hospitalizations are rated as potentially avoidable.5-7 On av-
erage, NH residents are sent to the ED close to twice per year,
many with normal vital signs and no diagnostic test, suggest-
ing that these visits were avoidable.8 These patterns are par-
ticularly troubling given that NH residents are at high risk to
developcomplicationsduringhospitalizationandEDvisits.9,10
Thelackoffocusonreducingreadmissionshasbeenattrib-
uted in part to Medicare payment policies that historically pro-
vided little financial incentive to coordinate care across health
caresettings.1-4NewMedicarepaymentreforms,suchasaccount-
able care organizations and bundled payments, are intended to
produceincentivestoreducepotentiallyavoidablehospitalad-
missions.Inthiscontext,NHsneedeffectiveapproachestobet-
ter coordinate care and reduce hospitalizations.
TheINTERACTprogram(InterventionstoReduceAcuteCare
Transfers)includesasetoftoolsthataddressthekeyfactorslead-
ingtoavoidablehospitaladmissionsandEDvisitsamongNHresi-
dents. INTERACT is based on 3 core tenets: (1) recognition and
management of acute conditions before they become severe
enoughtorequirehospitalization;(2)providingcommunication,
documentation,anddecisionsupporttoolsthatallowforeffec-
tive management in the NH without hospital admission when
safe and feasible; and (3) emphasizing advance care planning,
hospice,andpalliativecaretoencouragegoalsofcarediscussions
and reduce hospitalizations in people with end-stage illness
amongwhomtherisksanddiscomfortsofhospitalcareoftenout-
weighthebenefits.11AnonrandomizedpilotstudyofINTERACT
involving 30 volunteer NHs found a 24% reduction in all-cause
hospitalizationsamongNHsthatactivelyparticipated,compared
with only a 6% reduction in those that did not.12 The NHs that
activelyparticipatedinimplementingINTERACT,however,may
havesystematicallydifferedfromthosethatdidnot(forexample,
in motivation to reduce hospitalizations).
To address this potential selection bias, we conducted a
cluster-randomized clinical trial with the hypothesis that NHs
provided with INTERACT training and implementation sup-
port would have a greater reduction in rates of hospitaliza-
tion and ED visits than control NHs. The intent-to-treat analy-
sis explored 2 potential paths by which effective INTERACT
implementationcouldleadtoreducedhospitalizations:(1)Resi-
dent medical conditions could be managed more effectively
leading to fewer acute conditions that might require admis-
sion; we hypothesized that this path would result in fewer
hospitalizations.13 (2) Problems might be identified and man-
aged earlier in the NH; this was assessed by examining the rate
of ED visits that did not result in hospital admission.

Residents were identified using the Minimum Data Set
(MDS) for each participating NH and linked with information
on Medicare coverage, demographics, and mortality using the
Medicare Master Beneficiary Summary File. The preinterven-
tion period was defined as January 2012 to February 2013 and
the intervention period was March 2013 to February 2014.
Hospitalizations and Medicare covered NH stays were identi-
fied using the Medicare Provider Analysis and Review file.
Emergency department visits were identified using outpa-
tient claims files. The evaluation data came from Medicare rec-
ords for beneficiaries with fee-for-service coverage (ie, Parts
A and B, because not all physicians are required to submit
claimsforMedicareAdvantageenrollees14),leadingtoasample
size of 9050 and 8380 residents in intervention NHs in the

Measures
The primary outcome was the rate of hospitalizations per 1000
resident-days.Inaddition,weexaminedotheroutcomesthatdi-

(within30-dayofNHadmission)andlow-riskperiods(≥31days

rates of ED visits that did not result in hospital admission. We
investigated other outcomes (not reported) that do not directly

TheanalysescontrolledforbaselineNHcharacteristicsthat

 Our models needed to account for the correlation of errors
within facilities over time, reflecting that the cluster random-
ization occurred at the facility level and outcomes for patients
within the same facility may be correlated. We followed the
literature and calculated cluster-robust standard errors at the
facility level; the advantage of this approach is that the cluster-
robust errors do not require a correct specification of within-
clustererrorcorrelation.23,24Performingananalysisofvariance

thatbecauseofthelargenumberofresidentsineachcluster(250

facilities could lead to underestimated standard errors.25
Results
Of the 281 752 person-months identified through MDS assess-
ments among residents in NHs with no reported baseline expo-
sure to INTERACT, 45 648 (16%) were covered under Medicare
Advantage and dropped from the analysis. The proportion was
lower for the intervention relative to the control groups (12% vs
19%).Anadditional4%(n = 8964)weredroppedduetomissing

 NHsexhibitedaslightlyhigherrateofpotentiallyavoidablehos-
pitalizations in the preintervention period and converged with
control NHs during the intervention period (Figure 2B). Trends
for ED visits without admission were also very similar between
the intervention and control groups (Figure 2C).
Intervention NHs exhibited no significant reduction in
overall hospital admissions relative to control NHs (−0.13 hos-
pitalizations per 1000 resident-days; 95% CI, −0.36 to 0.10;
P = .25) (Table 3). The standard error for the estimated effect
on overall hospital admissions (0.12) implies that we were able
to detect effect sizes larger than 0.24 hospitalizations per 1000
resident-days, which is a 6.5% reduction in hospitalizations for
the intervention group relative to the preperiod (3.66 hospi-
talizations per 1000 resident-days). Similarly, there was no sig-
nificant reduction in hospitalizations within 30 days of NH ad-
mission or 31 or more days after NH admission. We did find a
reduction in potentially avoidable hospitalizations (−0.18 hos-
pitalizations per 1000 resident-days; 95% CI, −0.31 to −0.04;
P = .01); this represents a nearly 15% reduction in hospitaliza-
tions relative to the preintervention rate among intervention
facilities. This estimate was not robust to adjusting for mul-
tiple comparisons with a Bonferroni correction; with 6 out-
comes, the P value threshold for statistical significance was
.008. Results for readmission rates and ED visits without hos-
pital admission showed no significant differences between the
intervention and control groups (Table 3). We found no sig-
nificant effects for outcomes that were not prespecified (hos-
pitalizations via the ED, all ED visits, ED visits without admis-
sion that were deemed primary care treatable,26 mortality, and
a composite outcome including NH deaths, hospitalizations,
and observations stays). Focusing on just severely impaired
residents (based on the presence of advanced disability, se-
vere cognitive impairment, and/or short life expectancy in the
MDS), we found a similar pattern of results as for the main
sample; all effects were insignificant except for potentially
avoidable hospitalizations.
Inaseriesofsensitivityanalyses,weestimatedthemainre-
gressionspecificationsforthefullsampleof264nursinghomes
that were initially randomized and found no significant effects

focused on severely impaired resident-months within the full
sample of NHs, we found significant reductions in ED visits for
INTERACT relative to control NHs that were larger in magni-
tudethaninthesampleofNHswithnobaselineINTERACTuse.
When we estimated the main analysis at the resident-month
level, including facility fixed effects, year-month fixed effects,
andresidentcharacteristicsandclusteringstandarderrorsatthe
facility level, we found similar results to the results from the
facility-month level (eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2) (Table 1).
Finally, we used a 22-month postperiod (extending to the end
of 2014) and found similar results.
Discussion
The INTERACT program seeks to improve quality of care and
reduce hospital readmissions through improved identifica-
tion, evaluation, and management of acute changes in condi-
tion; use of care paths and decision support by NH staff;
increasing advanced care planning activities; and facilitating
quality improvement activities. This study evaluated training
andimplementationsupportfortheINTERACTprogramacross
85 NHs that reported no use of INTERACT before the trial was
initiated. Overall, the training and implementation support
model did not reduce hospitalizations or ED visits, with statis-
tically insignificant findings for 5 of 6 of the prespecified study
outcomes. The reduction in potentially avoidable hospitaliza-
tions in intervention facilities implies some evidence for over-
allbettermanagementofacutechangesincondition.Whilethis
estimate was not statistically significant after applying a
Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons, the magni-
tude implied a nearly 15% reduction in potentially avoidable
hospitalizations relative to the preintervention rate for inter-
vention NHs. This compares to a 17% relative reduction in all-
cause hospitalizations observed in our pilot study.12 In

readmission rate, which is a proportion of index hospitalizations that were
associated with a hospital readmission within 30 d), adjusted for resident and

in a typical NH with a census of 100 would represent 3 to 4 hospital

 MedicaidServices(CMS)study27designedtoreducehospitaliza-
tions among long-stay residents, the multifaceted intervention
programs involving 143 facilities in seven states resulted in 2.2
to9.3percentagepointreductionsintheprobabilityofall-cause
hospitalizations across states and 1.4 to 7.2 percentage point
reductions in the probability of potentially avoidable hospital-
izations and substantial reductions in Medicare expenditures.
The lack of effects of the training and implementation
support for INTERACT in this study may be related to several
factors, including the specific nature of the training and
implementation support provided, the quality of the NH
staff and medical care, concerns over legal and regulatory
liability of attempts to manage sicker patients in the NH, and
varying degrees of motivation to reduce hospitalizations, ED
visits, and hospital readmissions based on the local penetra-
tion of value-based care initiatives such as Medicare-
managed care, bundled payments, and accountable care
organizations. Evidence for the importance of motivation
can be seen in 2 studies28,29 of hospitals that showed that
the intensity of hospital efforts to reduce readmissions was
more important than the techniques used. Moreover, a
recent qualitative study of NHs found that a key difference
between NHs with high and low hospitalization rates was
staff attitudes towards hospital transfers.30
The results of this cluster randomized trial differ from an
earlier evaluation of INTERACT12 and data reported on a CMS
program.27 The pilot study and the CMS program focused on
voluntaryadoptersofINTERACT,andthusmayhavebeensub-
jecttoselectionbias—inparticular,theadoptersmayhavebeen
more motivated to reduce hospitalizations that contributed to
the reduction in hospitalizations. In contrast, INTERACT train-
ingandimplementationsupportwasrandomlyassignedacross
participatingNHsinthisstudy,andthusinterventionstatuswas
independent of motivation and other differences across NHs
in the sample. Moreover, the policy climate has changed since
the pilot study. Shortly before the current study was initiated,
Medicare implemented the Hospital Readmissions Reduction
Program, a policy penalizing 30-day readmissions.19 Possibly
inresponsetothis,wefoundsomeevidencethatNHsinthecon-
trol groups had adopted aspects of INTERACT before and dur-
ing the intervention period (albeit without training from the
study) that may have diluted the effect. Among the interven-
tion NHs, the extent of training and support may have been in-
sufficient. Nursing homes participating in the pilot study re-
ceived more hands-on training, while the cluster randomized
trial relied on online training and telephonic support. Many of
the intervention NHs that received tools, training, and imple-
mentation support did not take full advantage of the training
or adhere to requirements for data submission in their signed
participation agreements. For example, although champions
in each intervention NH were expected to complete all train-
ing modules, they only attended 67% of online webinars and
completed52%ofonlinecoursemodules;interventionNHssub-
mitted 63% of root cause transfers requested; and on average
NHs participated in 52% of monthly support/or feedback calls.
ThisincompleteparticipationwasunexpectedbecausetheNHs
randomized to the immediate intervention group all received
free INTERACT program materials and training, and participa-
tion agreements outlining their responsibilities were signed by
administrators, directors of nursing, and medical directors.
The monthly calls with NH champions and administrators

Limitations
Some limitations in our analysis must be noted. The original

formed,includingallNHsyieldedapositiveresultnotseeninthe
morerestrictedsample.Excludingthemloweredthepower;how-
ever, the standard errors on our estimate of the intervention
effect allowed us to detect reductions in overall hospitalization
rates of 6.5% or greater. Thus, we do not think that the overall
negative findings are driven by a lack of statistical power. Infor-
mationontheuseofINTERACTbyanNHduringthebaselinepe-
riod and during the study was self-reported and may have been
subject to inaccurate or biased reporting. Further analyses are
being conducted to explore the relative effects of implementa-
tion fidelity, motivation to reduce hospitalizations, and the de-
greeofparticipationinthetrainingandimplementationsupport
on the outcomes measured in this trial.
