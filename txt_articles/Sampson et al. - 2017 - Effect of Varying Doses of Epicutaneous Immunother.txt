IMPORTANCE Epicutaneous immunotherapy may have potential for treating peanut allergy
but has been assessed only in preclinical and early human trials.
OBJECTIVE To determine the optimal dose, adverse events (AEs), and efficacy of a peanut
patch for peanut allergy treatment.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Phase 2b double-blind, placebo-controlled,
dose-ranging trial of a peanut patch in peanut-allergic patients (6-55 years) from 22 centers,
with a 2-year, open-label extension (July 31, 2012-July 31, 2014; extension completed
September 29, 2016). Patients (n = 221) had peanut sensitivity and positive double-blind,
placebo-controlled food challenges to an eliciting dose of 300 mg or less of peanut protein.
INTERVENTIONS Randomly assigned patients (1:1:1:1) received an epicutaneous peanut patch
containing 50 μg (n = 53), 100 μg (n = 56), or 250 μg (n = 56) of peanut protein or a placebo
patch (n = 56). Following daily patch application for 12 months, patients underwent a
double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge to establish changes in eliciting dose.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary efficacy end point was percentage of treatment
responders (eliciting dose: �10-times increase and/or reaching �1000 mg of peanut protein)
in each group vs placebo patch after 12 months. Secondary end points included percentage of
responders by age strata and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).
RESULTS Of 221 patients randomized (median age, 11 years [quartile 1, quartile 3: 8, 16]; 37.6%
female), 93.7% completed the trial. A significant absolute difference in response rates was
observed at month 12 between the 250-μg (n = 28; 50.0%) and placebo (n = 14; 25.0%)
patches (difference, 25.0%; 95% CI, 7.7%-42.3%; P = .01). No significant difference was seen
between the placebo patch vs the 100-μg patch. Because of statistical testing hierarchical rules,
the 50-μg patch was not compared with placebo. Interaction by age group was only significant
for the 250-μg patch (P = .04). In the 6- to 11-year stratum, the response rate difference
between the 250-μg (n = 15; 53.6%) and placebo (n = 6; 19.4%) patches was 34.2% (95% CI,
11.1%-57.3%; P = .008); adolescents/adults showed no difference between the 250-μg (n = 13;
46.4%) and placebo (n = 8; 32.0%) patches: 14.4% (95% CI, −11.6% to 40.4%; P = .40). No
dose-related serious AEs were observed. The percentage of patients with 1 or more TEAEs
(largely local skin reactions) was similar across all groups in year 1: 50-μg patch = 100%, 100-μg
patch = 98.2%, 250-μg patch = 100%, and placebo patch = 92.9%. The overall median
adherence was 97.6% after 1 year; the dropout rate for treatment-related AEs was 0.9%.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this dose-ranging trial of peanut-allergic patients, the
250-μg peanut patch resulted in significant treatment response vs placebo patch following 12
months of therapy. These findings warrant a phase 3 trial.

 P
eanut allergy was estimated to affect approximately
2% of US children aged 18 years and younger in 2014,1
and studies suggest that the prevalence has been
increasing.2 As of 2014, peanut allergy was considered the
most common cause of severe and fatal food-induced ana-
phylactic reactions in the United States.3,4 The only approved
management strategy for peanut allergy is avoidance and
emergency management of severe reactions due to acciden-
tal ingestions,4 which has a marked adverse effect on the
quality of life of patients and caregivers.5 Several approaches
are under investigation, including oral, sublingual, and epi-
cutaneous immunotherapy.6 Oral immunotherapy has been
the most extensively studied form of therapy. Numerous
single-center studies have been published; although they
have demonstrated induction of varying degrees of desensiti-
zation, there is concern about significant risk of severe
treatment-associated adverse reactions.7 Moreover, only a
minority of treated patients achieve any measure of longer-
term tolerance.8,9
Epicutaneous immunotherapy uses an allergen-
adsorbed patch (peanut patch), which in murine models has
been shown to deliver allergen to the epidermal layer of
normal intact skin, where it is taken up by Langerhans cells
and transported to regional lymph nodes.10 After a recent
phase 1 trial in peanut-allergic individuals demonstrated
safety and tolerability,11 a 1-year phase 2b trial of the peanut
patch was conducted in peanut-allergic patients to identify
the most effective dose and to establish its adverse event
(AE) profile, efficacy, and acceptability. Patients completing
the phase 2b trial were invited to participate in a 2-year
extension trial using the most effective peanut-patch dose
to assess efficacy for up to 36 months.
Methods
This was a phase 2b, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, dose-ranging study of epicutaneous immuno-
therapy with a peanut patch (Viaskin Peanut) for 1 year fol-
lowed by a voluntary, 2-year, open-label extension study to
evaluate the efficacy of the peanut patch. Patients and
investigators were kept blinded to study treatment (phase
2b: July 31, 2012-July 31, 2014; extension completed Sep-
tember 29, 2016). The trial protocol (Supplement 1) and con-
sent forms were approved by each center’
s institutional
review board. Written informed consent was obtained from
all study participants or parents/guardians with assents for
children older than 7 years or per local institutional review
board guidelines.
Participants
Patients were recruited at 22 tertiary referral allergy/
immunology centers in North America and Europe (study
design summarized in eFigure 1 in Supplement 2). Eligible
participants were aged 6 to 55 years with an established
clinical history of peanut allergy, peanut skin prick test
wheal diameter of 8 mm or greater, serum peanut-specific
IgE level (Phadia ImmunoCAP system; Thermo Scientific)
greater than 0.7 kUA/L, and eliciting dose (last single food
challenge dose administered prior to the development of
objective clinical symptoms) of 300 mg or less of pea-
nut protein at the initial double-blind, placebo-controlled
food challenge (food challenge). Individuals with chronic
disease, unstable asthma, or a history of severe anaphylaxis
to peanut (previous hypotension, neurologic compromise,
or mechanical ventilation) were excluded for ethical and
safety reasons.
Interventions
Standardized food challenges using PRACTALL criteria12 were
conducted before initiating therapy and following 12, 24, and
36 months of daily peanut-patch application. Incremental
peanut protein doses of 1, 3, 10, 30, 100, and 300 mg every
30 minutes were used for all challenges, with additional
doses of 1000 and 2000 mg of peanut protein for challenges
at 12, 24, and 36 months. An additional dose of 1600 mg
of peanut protein was administered at 24 and 36 months.
Peanut protein doses were administered in a standardized
chocolate pudding.13 Food challenges were discontinued and
eliciting doses were established only when clear-cut objec-
tive symptoms were present (eTable 1 in Supplement 2).12
Once qualified, patients were randomly assigned at a ratio of
1:1:1:1 to receive patches containing 50 μg, 100 μg, or 250 μg
of peanut protein or placebo patch. Randomization was
stratified by site and age group using a dynamic randomiza-
tion schedule through Interactive Web Response Systems:
children aged 6 to 11 years and adolescents/adults aged 12 to
55 years (treatment block size was 4). Patients and their fami-
lies were reimbursed for travel cost limited to US$40 per
visit; there were no additional financial incentives.
Peanut and placebo patches, which were indistinguish-
able in appearance, were applied daily on the backs of chil-
dren and inner upper arms of adolescents and adults. The
first patch was applied under observation at the study site.
Subsequent patches were self-administered at home once
daily for 3, 6, and 12 hours per day during the first, second,
and third weeks, respectively, followed by 24 hours daily
thereafter. Patients were seen at 3, 6, and 12 months, at
which time skin prick tests and serum immunoglobulin lev-
els were repeated (eAppendix in Supplement 2). Blood was
also collected to screen for filaggrin gene mutations, which
have been associated with defective skin barrier and atopic
dermatitis.14 Patients who had received a placebo patch in
Key Points
Question What are the effects of varying doses of an
epicutaneous immunotherapy for peanut allergy on reaction
to peanut protein exposure?
Finding In this phase 2b randomized trial of 221 participants
with peanut allergy, a 250-μg dose of peanut protein resulted in a
significant treatment response compared with placebo (50% vs
25%) following 12 months of therapy.
Meaning These findings support further evaluation of
epicutaneous immunotherapy in a phase 3 trial.

 the first year were initially rerandomized to 50-μg, 100-μg, or
250-μg doses at entry into the 2-year, open-label extension;
at 6 months, all were switched to 250 μg, which was found
to be the most efficacious dose. Patients were instructed to
refrain from peanut consumption throughout the trials,
except during the food challenge.
Outcomes
The primary efficacy end point of the phase 2b trial was the
percentage of treatment responders after 12 months of
therapy. Patients were considered responders if the eliciting
dose during the posttreatment food challenge was 1000 mg
or more of peanut protein and/or 10-times or more greater
than the eliciting dose prior to treatment. The initial
responder criterion of a 10-times or more increase in thresh-
old was adapted from the National Institutes of Health–
sponsored Consortium of Food Allergy Research sublingual
immunotherapy trial15 and a recent epicutaneous immuno-
therapy trial.16
Secondary efficacy end points included the percentage of
respondersineachofthe2predeterminedagestrata(6-11years
[children] and 12-55 years [adolescents/adults]); mean cumu-
lative reactive dose (sum of all food challenge doses received
at development of objective
clinical symptoms) at month
12 and change from baseline;
and changes in severity of
symptoms (sum of all symp-
tomsduringfoodchallenges),
skin prick test wheal size
(wheal diameter measured
successively for undiluted
and 1/10, 1/100, 1/1000, and
1/10 000 dilutions), and se-
rum peanut-specific IgE and
IgG4 levels following 12
months of treatment (4 addi-
tional secondary end points not presented in this report are
listed in the eAppendix in Supplement 2). Safety end points
included the type, frequency, and severity of treatment-
emergent AEs (TEAEs), serious AEs, and premature discon-
tinuation. Compliance was defined as the total number of
patches dispensed minus the number returned, divided by
the number of days within the treatment period. Patients
graded application site skin reactions (erythema/redness,
pruritus/itching, or edema/swelling) or cutaneous symp-
toms daily for the first 3 months and whenever symptoms
occurred thereafter. The grading scale for each symptom
ranged from 0 to 3 (0 = absent; 1 = mild; 2 = moderate; and
3 = severe) (eAppendix in Supplement 2). Skin symptoms
were also assessed by investigators at each study visit. End
points for the 2-year open-label extension were the same as
for the randomized trial.
Statistical Methods
A sample size of 47 patients per treatment group was deter-
mined to retain 90% power to detect an absolute difference
(250 μg minus placebo) in the primary end point of 30%
(assuming a placebo response rate of 10%); 2-sided α < .05.
This response estimate was agreed on with the US Food and
Drug Administration. Assuming a 15% dropout rate, as seen
in other studies, 221 patients were randomized.
The overall type I error rate for the primary analyses was
controlled through a prespecified fixed-sequence testing
strategy (pairwise comparisons between 250 μg, 100 μg, and
50 μg vs placebo). Accordingly, testing would cease beyond
the first observed P value less than or equal to .05. All other
outcomes in this study were considered exploratory. How-
ever, an interaction between age categories (ie, children and
adolescents/adults) and each treatment group (vs placebo)
for the primary end point was carried out to identify the need
for any subgroup analysis. For the primary end point, if the
month 12 eliciting dose was missing, the patient would be
defaulted to count as a nonresponder (last-observation-
carried-forward).
The primary analysis was intention to treat. Sensitivity
analyses for consistency of the primary end point were per-
formed(per-protocolanalysis;worst-caseimputationmethod;
multipleimputation17).Forsecondaryendpoints,missingdata
were addressed through several sensitivity analyses (default
nonresponder, multiple imputation, or no imputation).
Treatment effects on eliciting dose, cumulative reactive
dose, skin prick test, and immunological markers (IgE, IgG4)
were compared with placebo. Adverse events reported in
patients who had at least 1 patch application were summa-
rized (eAppendix in Supplement 2). For the 2-year, open-
label study, variability estimates (confidence intervals or
quartile [Q] 1, Q3) were presented for descriptive purposes.
No tests of significance were conducted. SAS (version 9.4;
SAS Institute) and Stata/IC (version 15; StataCorp) were used
for all analyses.
Results
Study Participants
A total of 221 patients (median age, 11 years [Q1, Q3: 8, 16];
37.6% female) were randomized (53, 56, and 56 patients to
50-μg, 100-μg, and 250-μg peanut patches, respectively,
and 56 to placebo patch) across 22 study sites (Figure 1).
Baseline distributions of age, peanut-specific IgE or IgG4
levels, skin prick test wheal diameter, or peanut protein
eliciting doses in the 4 study groups were balanced
(Table 1). There were 113 children (aged 6-11 years), 73 ado-
lescents (aged 12-17 years), and 35 adults (aged 18-55 years)
randomized; the median eliciting doses for children and
adolescents/adults were 30 mg (Q1, Q3: 1, 100) and 100 mg
(Q1, Q3: 30, 300), respectively (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2).
At 12 months, overall compliance with treatment in the
phase 2b trial was 97.6% (Q1, Q3: 93, 100); 6.3% of patients
discontinued the study prematurely.

 difference in response rates between the 250-μg patch
(n = 28; 50.0%) and placebo patch (n = 14; 25.0%) was 25%
(95% CI, 7.7%-42.3%; P = .01), thus achieving statistical sig-
nificance. This corresponded to an estimated number-
needed-to-treat of 4. The response rate for the 100-μg patch
was 41.1%, for a difference from placebo of 16.1% (95% CI,
−1.1% to 33.2%; P = .11), which failed to achieve statistical sig-
nificance. Hence, in concordance with the prespecified fixed-
sequential testing strategy, a formal 50-μg placebo hypoth-
esis test was not conducted.

Exploratory Secondary End Points
As shown in Table 2, the interaction by age group was only sig-
nificantforthe250-μgpatch(P = .04).Responseratesatmonth
12 in children (53.6%) were greater than for the placebo patch
(19.4%;difference,34.2%;95%CI,11.1%-57.3%;P = .008).Simi-
lar analyses in the adolescent/adult stratum showed no dif-
ferencesbetweentheplacebopatch(32%)andthe250-μgpatch
(46.4%; difference, 14.4%; 95% CI, −11.6% to 40.4%; P = .40).
The mean cumulative reactive dose at month 12 was
greater for the 250-μg patch (1117.8 mg) than for the placebo
patch (469.3 mg) overall (least squares [LS] mean differ-
ence, 336.2; 95% CI, 110.9-739.7) and for the children stra-
tum (250-μg patch: 1211.9 mg; placebo patch: 239.1 mg;
LS mean difference, 333.7; 95% CI, 92.5-887.6) (eTable 4 in
Supplement 2). No meaningful differences between the pea-
nut patch and placebo patch were observed in the
adolescent/adult stratum. Although many patients received
larger challenge doses at month 12, symptom severity
showed no significant differences between baseline and
month 12 within treatment groups in the overall population
(eTable 5 in Supplement 2).

 Immunologic Correlates
The evolution of peanut-specific IgE and IgG4 levels over
the 12-month period is presented in Figure 2. Compared
with the placebo patch, median peanut-specific IgE levels
increased numerically over the first 3 to 6 months overall in
patients treated with the 50-μg, 100-μg, and 250-μg peanut
patches, followed by a gradual decrease to near baseline lev-
els at month 12.

a Missing scores for month 12 were imputed from baseline values. Handling of
missing data was carried out using the LOCF method; namely, for each patient,
a missing value at month 12 was replaced by the baseline value.
bA treatment responder was defined as a patient with an eliciting dose of
1000 mg or more of peanut protein after 12 months of treatment or a patient
with a 10-times increase in the eliciting dose at 12 months compared
with the initial eliciting dose, based on the results of the 2 double-blind,

luted test samples are presented in eFigure 3 in Supplement
2. The outputs for the 1/1000 and 1/10 000 dilutions are not
shown, as the effects beyond 1/100 dilutions were not infor-

cebo patch group.
Adverse Events
All TEAEs are summarized in Table 3. During the phase 2b pe-
riod, occurrence of TEAEs and TEAE event rates were bal-
anced across all peanut patch–treated groups. TEAEs related
to the investigational product occurred approximately twice
as often in the peanut-patch groups when compared with the
placebo-patchgroup:96.2%forthe50-μgpeanutpatch,94.6%
for the 100-μg peanut patch, and 96.4% for the 250-μg pea-
nut patch vs 48.2% for the placebo patch, primarily during the
first months of treatment. TEAEs leading to study discontinu-
ation were rare. Serious TEAEs occurred infrequently in all
treated groups.

3 of 165 peanut patch–treated patients discontinued because
of AEs: 1 for an AE unrelated to the peanut patch and 2 (0.9%)

 and 1 with the 250-μg peanut patch; all were discharged sev-
eral hours later after receiving an epinephrine injection. In ad-
dition, no differences in AEs were identified in patients with
atopic dermatitis or with heterozygous (25 patients [15.8%])
or homozygous (2 patients [1.3%]) filaggrin gene mutations.
Two-Year, Open-Label Extension Trial
Of the 207 patients completing the 1-year, blinded phase 2b
trial, 171 (82.6%) were enrolled in the 2-year, open-label
extension: 97 of 113 children (85.8%) and 74 of 108
adolescents/adults (68.5%). Within 6 months of completing
the phase 2b trial, all enrolled patients were transitioned to
the 250-μg peanut patch for the remainder of the study. Of
171 patients enrolled in the open-label extension study, 3
withdrew from the study before receiving treatment with
the 250-μg patch. Of 168 patients who received the 250-μg
patch in the open-label extension study, 57 switched to the
250-μg patch at month 6: 22 patients who received the
50-μg patch in the phase 2b study received the 50-μg patch
at open-label extension entry before switching to the 250-μg
patch at month 6; 20 patients who received the 100-μg patch
in the phase 2b study received the 100-μg patch at open-
label extension study entry before switching to the 250-μg
patch at month 6; 7 patients who received the placebo patch
in the phase 2b study received the 50-μg patch at open-label
extension entry before switching to the 250-μg patch at
month 6; and 8 patients who received the placebo patch in
the phase 2b study received the 100-μg patch at open-label
extension entry before switching to the 250-μg patch at
month 6.
All patients underwent a food challenge at months 12 and
24 of the extension. Based on the per-protocol population, the
response rates at months 12 and 24 in the overall population
were 59.7% (89/149) and 64.5% (80/124), respectively. Dur-
ing the open-label extension, 54 of 171 patients overall (31.6%)
discontinued for various reasons, 2 (1.2%) because of AEs
(including 1 TEAE). Median treatment compliance during
the open-label extension was 95.5% (Q1, Q3: 89, 99). Occur-
rence of TEAEs was 93% (159/171) and 62% (106/171) in years 1
and 2 of the extension, respectively (Table 3). Local skin re-
actions decreased over time but continued to be the most com-
monadversesymptomsreported.Duringtheextension,TEAEs,
severe TEAEs, and TEAEs related to the investigational prod-
uct occurred largely during year 1 (93%).
Per-protocol response rates in children at months 12 and
24 of the extension were 63.3% and 68.4%, respectively
(eTable 7 in Supplement 2). Similar analyses in the
adolescent/adult stratum showed a response rate of 54.2%
and 57.8% at months 12 and 24, respectively. During the
extension, median compliance was 95.7% (Q1, Q3: 89, 99) in
children; although 16% of this cohort dropped out, none of
the discontinuations for TEAEs were related to the investiga-
tional product.
Discussion
In this phase 2b dose-ranging trial of peanut-allergic
patients aged 6 to 55 years, the 250-μg peanut patch
resulted in significant treatment response vs the placebo
patch, as determined by increases in eliciting dose during
the double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenges
at baseline and after 1 year of therapy. The rates of TEAEs
were similar across all peanut-patch dosages in the first

in peanut-patch groups compared with the placebo-patch
group. Reactions were mostly mild to moderate in sever-
ity, and they lasted less than 3 months in half of the pa-
tients treated.
Following 12 months of epicutaneous immunotherapy,
the primary end point was achieved with the 250-μg peanut
patch in the overall group and in exploratory analyses of chil-
dren aged 6 to 11 years. The greatest effect was seen with the
250-μg peanut patch in children, with approximately 50%
achieving the primary end point at 12 months. (Based on
these results and following consultation with the US Food
and Drug Administration, a phase 3 trial was initiated in chil-
dren aged 4 to 11 years using the 250-μg peanut patch.) The
2-year, open-label extension demonstrated compliance rates
similar to the phase 2b trial, with no increase in the rate of
patch-related TEAEs.
The 25% response rate of placebo-patch patients was con-
siderably greater than the projected rate (10%) and higher than
reportedinotherstudies.Thereasonforthisfindingisnotclear
but may be owing to the challenge procedure and prespeci-
fied response criteria. To our knowledge, this is the largest trial
to use the PRACTALL food challenge guidelines,13 which ini-
tiate food challenges at very low doses (1 mg) of food protein
and then increase the dose by semilog quantities. The vari-
ability of response to food challenges at such low doses (doses
at which the highest rate of placebo response occurred in this
study) has never been evaluated, especially in the adolescent/
adult group. Also, most placebo responders fulfilled the cri-
terion of a 10-times increase over the baseline threshold chal-
lenge dose, which was adapted from the National Institutes
of Health–sponsored Consortium of Food Allergy Research
trial of epicutaneous immunotherapy16 and which may not
have provided adequate stringency for response.
In the a priori calculations of sample size and statistical
power, a 30% absolute difference for the primary end point be-
tween active drug and placebo was assumed. This absolute dif-
ference was not achieved with the overall group, owing at least
inparttotheunexpectedlyhighplaceboresponse,butwasmet
(34.2%) with the children’
s group.
Recently, Baumert and colleagues18 sought to quantify
the clinical benefit of increasing thresholds of reactivity in
peanut-allergic patients by modeling exposures to peanut
protein with individual threshold levels established in vari-
ous published clinical trials. Using US consumption data for
various food product categories, they found that increasing
the baseline threshold from 100 mg or less to 300 mg of
peanut protein would reduce the risk of an allergic reaction
by more than 95% for 4 food product categories that could
contain trace levels of peanut residue. Greater increases in
the threshold to 1000 mg had additional quantitative ben-
efits in reducing risk for patients reacting to 300 mg or less
of peanut protein at baseline.
This phase 2b trial and extension study, which included
an older and significantly larger patient population enrolled
in more diverse study sites in North America and Europe, fur-
ther validated the clinical efficacy, serological changes,
safety, and compliance reported in the Consortium of Food
Allergy Research epicutaneous immunotherapy trial.16
In addition, it provides information on the long-term daily
use of the 250-ug patch.
Given the lack of placebo control for comparison in the
extension study (as required by several study site institu-
tional review boards), conclusions regarding potential ben-
efits of more prolonged epicutaneous immunotherapy are
not possible. The reason for the different therapeutic
response in adolescents/adults compared with children is not
clear, but it may be owing to the application site of the patch
(ie, upper inner arm vs back), relatively lower dose on a per-
weight/surface area basis compared with children, relatively
smaller patch size relative to total body surface area, less per-
meable stratum corneum, and possibly less immunologic
plasticity in older patients. Studies in murine models have
shown that higher doses and exposure to larger surface areas
increase efficacy,19 and studies are under way to optimize
peanut patches for adolescents/adults.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the primary end
point (10-times increase in challenge threshold) may not
have been sufficiently stringent for the lowest food chal-
lenge doses (1, 3, and 10 mg of peanut protein), which con-
tributed to the higher than expected rate of placebo
responders. Second, the sample size of each treatment
group was relatively small and therefore, the study was not
powered to detect a dose-response gradient. Third, the
study was not designed to detect an age effect independent
of a treatment effect, and the interaction by age group was
not significant for the 2 lower doses. Fourth, the open-label
extension had no placebo control. Fifth, exclusion of
patients with a history of severe anaphylaxis (as done in all
other food immunotherapy trials that include food chal-
lenges) may influence the results of the study, especially
those related to safety and tolerability end points.
Conclusions
Inthisdose-rangingtrialofpeanut-allergicpatients,the250-μg
peanut patch resulted in significant treatment response
vs placebo patch following 12 months of therapy. These find-
ings warrant a phase 3 trial.
