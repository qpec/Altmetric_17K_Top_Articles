Immunotherapy has revolutionized outcomes for cancer patients, but the mechanisms of resistance remain poorly 
defined. We used a series of whole-genome clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)–based 
screens performed in vitro and in vivo to identify mechanisms of tumor immune evasion from cytotoxic lymphocytes 
[CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) cells]. Deletion of key genes within the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling, 
interferon- (IFN-) signaling, and antigen presentation pathways provided protection of tumor cells from CD8+ 
 
T cell–mediated killing and blunted antitumor immune responses in vivo. Deletion of a number of genes in the TNF 
pathway also emerged as the key mechanism of immune evasion from primary NK cells. Our screens also identi-
fied that the metabolic protein 2-aminoethanethiol dioxygenase (Ado) modulates sensitivity to TNF-mediated 
killing by cytotoxic lymphocytes and is required for optimal control of tumors in vivo. Remarkably, we found that 
tumors delete the same genes when exposed to perforin-deficient CD8+ T cells, demonstrating that the dominant 
immune evasion strategy used by tumor cells is acquired resistance to T cell–derived cytokine- 
mediated antitumor effects. 
We demonstrate that TNF-mediated bystander killing is a potent T cell effector mechanism capable of killing 
antigen-negative tumor cells. In addition to highlighting the importance of TNF in CD8+ T cell– and NK cell–mediated 
killing of tumor cells, our study also provides a comprehensive picture of the roles of the TNF, IFN, and antigen pre-
sentation pathways in immune-mediated tumor surveillance.
INTRODUCTION
Cancer immunotherapies, such as checkpoint blockade, have had re-
markable success in the clinic; however, acquired resistance often devel-
ops through mechanisms that are not well defined (1–3). Neoantigens 
presented through major histocompatibility complex (MHC)–I facili-
tate detection of tumor cells by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and underpin the 
success of immune checkpoint blockade therapy (4–7). Thus, disrup-
tion of antigen presentation is a key mechanism of tumor immune eva-
sion, demonstrated by loss-of-function mutations in the genes encoding 
2-microglobulin (B2M), interferon- (IFN-) and Janus kinases (JAK1/2) 
in patients that fail to respond to immunotherapy (8–10).
Cytotoxic lymphocytes, such as CD8+ T cells and natural killer (NK) 
cells, promote antitumor immunity through a combination of direct 
perforin-dependent tumor cell killing and by increasing “tumor im-
mune sensitivity” through the release of inflammatory cytokines such as 
IFN- and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which act on both tumor and 
immune effector cells (11–13). However, the relative contribution of 
these additional mechanisms to tumor cell killing by cytotoxic lympho-
cytes is still unclear. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic 
repeat (CRISPR)–based loss-of-function screens are a powerful approach 
to identify genes that sensitize to, or protect tumors from, T cell– and 
NK cell–driven antitumor immunity. Here, we have used a series of whole- 
genome CRISPR- 
based screens to identify the genes and pathways that 
confer resistance to both CD8+ T cell– and NK cell–mediated killing. We 
found that suppression of cytokine signaling and antigen presentation 
are key mechanisms by which tumors evade attack by cytotoxic lympho-
cytes. In particular, we found that disruption of TNF-induced tumor 
cell death by CD8+ T cells was a major immune evasion mechanism.
RESULTS
Immune evasion occurs through loss of TNF, IFN-,  
or antigen presentation pathways
To uncover, in an unbiased manner, the genes and signaling pathways 
that regulate sensitivity to T cell–mediated attack, we first performed 
genome-wide CRISPR/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) screening 
in vitro using two tumor lines—MC38 colon adenocarcinoma and B16 
melanoma cells, both of which are responsive to IFN-, engineered 
to present the chicken ovalbumin (Ova) antigen on H-2Kb (MC38Ova, 
B16Ova), and recognized and killed by transgenic OT-I CD8+ T cells (fig. 
S1A). The expression of key molecules on the T cells and tumor cells 
is presented in fig. S1 (B to D). MC38Ova cells expressing Cas9 and sta-
bly transduced with a whole- 
genome guide RNA (gRNA) library 
were serially incubated with activated OT-I T cells, and the result-
ing population was sequenced to identify single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) 
that provided resistance to T cell–mediated killing (Fig. 1A). In this 
model, anti–PD-1 (programmed death 1) treatment enhanced both

OT-I T cell killing and cytokine production after recognition of 
MC38Ova cells (Fig. 1B). Parallel screens were conducted with the ad-
dition of an anti–PD-1 antibody to identify genes that confer resistance 
to checkpoint blockade therapy. Under these screening conditions, the 
surviving tumor cells were almost completely refractory to the in-
creased cell death conferred by anti–PD-1 (fig. S1E).
Deletion of genes from three principal pathways—antigen presen-
tation, IFN- signaling, and TNF signaling—provided protection from 
T cell killing (Fig. 1, C to F). Identification of Jak1, B2m, Ifngr1, and 
Tap1, key genes in antigen presentation and IFN- signaling, and re-
cently identified in similar screens (14, 15), validated our approach. 
We also uncovered genes, such as Casp8 and Tnfrsf1a, as crucial T cell 
effectors using our genome-wide screening approach (Fig. 1, C to F). 
Other less well-characterized genes, such as Sqstm1, Gosr1, and Ado, 
were also identified (Fig. 1, C to E). Subsequent depletion of selected 
genes from each pathway using two independent sgRNAs (fig. S2A) 
confirmed that they provided protection from T cell killing (Fig. 1G) 
without affecting MHC-I expression (fig. S2B). Nonbiased gene in-
teraction analysis using the top hits confirmed that the dominant 
immune evasion genes clustered in the TNF, IFN-, and antigen pre-
sentation pathways (Fig. 1H), and Gene Ontology (GO) term anal-
ysis classified antigen presentation, death receptor–mediated killing, 
and cytokine signaling as the key pathways affected (Fig. 1I).
Consistent with the screen carried out in MC38Ova cells, we iden-
tified Ifngr1/2, Jak1/2, and Stat1 as potent mediators of T cell killing 
using the B16Ova melanoma cell line (Fig. 1J), with enrichment of the 
IFN- and antigen presentation pathways but not TNF signaling 
(Fig. 1, K and L, and fig. S2C). To test a model system where antigen 
presentation is not required for T cell killing of target cells, we per-
formed a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen using HER2-directed 
human CAR T cells as effectors and HER2+ MDA-MB-231 tumors as 
targets. We failed to significantly enrich for deletion of IFN- or TNF 
pathway genes but successfully selected for sgRNAs targeting HER2 
(ERBB2) expression (Fig. 1M and fig. S2D). These results emphasized 
the importance of the IFN- pathway in regulating antigen presen-
tation, which is not required in the CAR T cell model, and highlighted 
that tumors selectively disrupt pathways that confer the highest lev-
els of vulnerability to T cell killing to evade immune attack.
NK cell immune evasion also occurs through loss  
of TNF pathway members
NK cells also recognize and kill tumor cells through specific receptor- 
ligand interactions, without the need for neoantigen presentation (16). 
We therefore performed a whole-genome CRISPR screen using pri-
mary mouse NK cells and MC38 tumor cells as target cells to identify 
genes that confer resistance to immune-mediated killing in the ab-
sence of the need for antigen presentation (Fig. 2A). NK cells effi-
ciently killed MC38 target cells and produced substantial amounts of 
both IFN- and TNF (Fig. 2, B and C). As seen in our immune eva-
sion CRISPR screens using CD8+ T cells, deletion of genes involved 
in TNF-mediated cell death was also the predominant mechanism of 
immune evasion against NK cell–mediated killing (Fig. 2, D to F). 
These data demonstrated that well-characterized genes in this path-
way, such as Casp8 and Tnfrsf1a, and previously poorly character-
ized genes, such as Ado, were crucial for both CD8+ T cell and NK 
cell antitumor effector function using two unbiased genome-wide 
CRISPR screens (Fig. 2G). This suggested that TNF derived from 
CD8+ T cells and NK cells upon target recognition plays an important 
role in mediating tumor cell death by these cells (Fig. 2H).
Immune evasion occurs independent of  
perforin-mediated killing
Notable in our results was that genes involved in direct CD8+ T and 
NK cell killing by the perforin-mediated granule-exocytosis path-
way were not identified in any of our immune evasion screens. We 
subsequently repeated the screen using perforin knockout (Prf1−/−) 
OT-I T cells, which efficiently killed MC38Ova and B16Ova cells in the 
presence of antigen over 18 hours (Fig. 3A and fig. S1A). sgRNAs tar-
geting the TNF signaling molecules Tradd, Casp8, and Fadd were 
heavily enriched using MC38Ova tumor cells as target cells and Prf1−/− 
OT-I T cells as effector cells (Fig. 3, B and H). Consistent with the data 
in Fig. 1, in a CRISPR screen using B16Ova as target cells and Prf1−/− 
OT-I T cells as effectors, sgRNAs targeting Ifngr1/2, Jak1/2, and Stat1 
were also enriched (Fig. 3, C and K). In the absence of perforin-mediated 
tumor cell killing, Tnfrsf1a was revealed as a common T cell sensi-
tivity gene between the two tumor types (Fig. 3, D and E), suggesting 
that, in the absence of perforin, the TNF pathway was engaged to kill 
B16 cells. Pathway interaction and GO term analysis confirmed that 
both TNF and IFN- signaling were the key T cell–mediated effector 
pathways affected (Fig. 3, F, G, I, and J).
T cell–derived cytokines drive immune evasion
Given the identification of cytokine networks in our tumor immune 
evasion screens, we performed 3′ RNA sequencing on MC38Ova cells 
exposed to T cells in the presence or absence of anti–PD-1, which re-
sulted in robust changes in gene transcription (Fig. 4A). Gene set 
enrichment analysis (GSEA) identified preferential regulation of 
the genes that respond to TNF and IFN- signaling (Fig. 4, B and C). 
Incubation of MC38 cells with supernatant from the T cell–MC38Ova 
coculture (Fig. 4D) or recombinant TNF and/or IFN- (fig. S3) elic-
ited a similar transcriptional signature to that identified after direct 
effector-target engagement. Furthermore, killing of MC38Ova and 
the breast tumor line E0771Ova using Prf1−/− OT-I T cells and coculture 
supernatant was abrogated in the presence of anti-TNF blocking 
antibody (Fig. 4E and fig. S4A) but not an anti-FasL blocking antibody 
(fig. S4B). Finally, recombinant TNF, but not IFN-, was shown to di-
rectly kill MC38Ova and E0771Ova tumor cells (Fig. 4E and fig. S4A).
We next introduced a customized sgRNA pool, encompassing the top 
scoring 2000 guides identified in Fig. 1, into Cas9-expressing MC38Ova 
cells, which were then exposed to three independent rounds of TNF 
treatment. As expected, and consistent with our CRISPR screen using 
wild-type and Prf1−/− T cells as immune effectors, this screen also en-
riched for genes known to modulate TNF- 
induced cell death, including 
casp8, tradd, and tnfrsf1a, as well as uncharacterized genes in the TNF 
pathway, such as Ado (Fig. 4, F and G, and fig. S4C). We also sorted 
for cells that failed to up-regulate MHC-I upon IFN treatment. This re-
vealed that the Jak1/2- 
Stat1-Tap1 axis, but not TNF signaling, was critical 
for optimal antigen presentation, and highlighted the role of IFN- in 
this process (Fig. 4, H to J).
To determine whether T cell–mediated “bystander killing” of tumors 
not directly engaged by a T cell occurred, we used time-lapse microscopy. 
As expected, MC38Ova cells (green) were rapidly eliminated by the OT-I 
T cells (unlabeled), an effect that was delayed by a TNF-neutralizing 
antibody (Fig. 5A and movie S1). Notably, MC38Vec cells (blue) were 
similarly killed over a 24-hour time period, demonstrating significant 
bystander killing that was also inhibited by neutralizing TNF (Fig. 5A 
and movie S2). TNF-mediated by 
stander killing was also confirmed in 
killing assays using chromium- 
labeled MC38Vec cells mixed in a 50:50 
ratio with unlabeled MC38Ova cells, using perforin wild-type or

knockout effector OT-I T cells (Fig. 5B). Thus, upon antigen recognition, 
CD8+ T cells can efficiently kill antigen-negative bystander tumor 
cells through TNF. In support of this, we found that anti–PD-1 therapy 
also enhanced antitumor immunity in perforin-deficient mice in vivo 
(Fig. 5C), an effect most likely due to enhanced TNF production 
upon checkpoint blockade, and enhanced TNF bystander killing in 
the absence of perforin.
Immune evasion occurs through loss of TNF signaling,  
IFN- signaling, or antigen presentation in vivo
To confirm our findings in vivo, Cas9-expressing MC38Ova cells were 
transduced with the customized 2000-sgRNA pool used in Fig. 4 
(F and G), injected into NSG mice, and tumor-bearing mice were 
adoptively transplanted with OT-I T cells. Sequencing of tumors har-
vested 4 to 7 days after OT-I T cell transfer 
revealed enrichment in sgRNAs targeting 
genes involved in IFN- signaling (stat1), 
antigen presentation (tap1), and TNF 
signaling (caspase-8, tnfrsf1a, and ado) 
(Fig. 6, A and B, and fig. S5A). To validate 
these findings, we individually depleted an 
immune evasion gene from each path-
way in MC38Ova cells and transplanted 
these into NSG mice that subsequently 
received adoptively transferred OT-I 
T cells. The proliferation in vitro and 
growth in vivo of these tumor lines were 
not significantly different (fig. S5B). How-
ever, depletion of tap1, tnfrsf1a, or jak1 sig-
nificantly reduced the efficacy of adoptive 
cellular therapy (Fig. 6C), highlighting 
the importance of these three pathways in 
tumor immune evasion in vivo (Fig. 6D). 
We identified that low expression of at 
least two genes from each of these three 
pathways was associated with significant-
ly poorer prognosis in patients with colo-
rectal cancer (Fig. 6E).
Because we had identified Ado as im-
portant for tumor cell sensitivity to death 
induced by CD8+ T and NK cells, using 
both our in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screen-
ing (Figs. 1E, 2D, 3H, 4G, and 6B), and 
because our targeted screen suggested that 
Ado modulates TNF sensitivity (Fig. 4F) 
but not IFN- signaling pathways (Fig. 4J), 
we investigated this gene further. Ado plays 
a role in the cysteine metabolism pathway, 
where it converts cysteamine to hypotaurine 
(17). To investigate the potential role of 
Ado in regulating the metabolic state of 
MC38 tumor cells, we first performed com-
prehensive metabolomic profiling of Ado 
control and knockout MC38 tumor cells 
(Fig. 7). We identified disrupted cysteine 
metabolism and polyamine synthesis path-
ways upon Ado depletion. We next per-
formed transcriptional profiling of Ado 
control and knockout MC38 tumor cells, 
under both steady state and TNF stimulation, to investigate altered gene 
expression under steady-state Ado loss (Fig. 8A). The rapid induction 
of classical TNF-induced target genes was not affected by Ado deple-
tion, suggesting that Ado was not directly involved in TNF-induced 
signal transduction (Fig. 8B). However, depletion of Ado in MC38Ova 
cells using two independent sgRNAs significantly impaired killing by 
OT-I T cells (Fig. 8C) and significantly reduced TNF-induced killing 
of MC38Ova cells (Fig. 8D and fig. S6A) but not granzyme B–induced 
killing (fig. S6B). Depletion of Ado in two additional tumor lines, the 
mouse breast line EO771 and the human breast line AU565, also con-
ferred decreased sensitivity to TNF-mediated cell death (figs. S6C and 
S7D). To determine whether deletion of Ado suppressed T cell killing 
in vivo, we injected Ado-depleted MC38Ova cells into NSG mice and 
monitored the efficacy of adoptive T cellular therapy. Ado-depleted

tumors were significantly protected from the anti 
tumor activity of 
T cells in vivo (Fig. 8E). Depletion of another uncharacterized mole-
cule, Golgi SNAP receptor complex member 1 (Gosr1), also impaired 
killing of MC38Ova cells by OT-I T cells (fig. S7A) and impaired tu-
mor control in vivo (fig. S7B). Reduced expression of Gosr1 was also 
found to be associated with poor prognosis in a number of cancer 
types (fig. S7C). These data confirmed that deletion of Ado or Gosr1 
protected tumor cells from T cell killing, suppressed antitumor im-
mune responses in an in vivo tumor model, and is associated with 
poor patient prognosis in different cancer types.
DISCUSSION
Using a series of whole-genome and customized CRISPR screens, we 
identified TNF, IFN-, and antigen presentation as the major pathways 
necessary for, and used by, CD8+ T cells to kill tumor cells in vitro and 
in vivo. Our study also found that TNF was a potent NK cell effector 
molecule and that the TNF-mediated apoptotic pathway was engaged 
to kill tumors in the context of NK cell attack. We did not find a role 
for IFN- in the context of NK cell–driven tumor immune evasion. 
These results suggest that tumor cells dampen the effects of IFN- 
signaling predominantly as a strategy to limit presentation of antigen

to CD8+ T cells via MHC-I, not to minimize the potential cytostatic 
effects of this cytokine (18). Consistent with this, evasion from CAR 
T cell–mediated killing of tumor cells was mediated by selective loss 
of the CAR T cell target molecule (Her2) and not through any ef-
fects on the IFN- pathway. Thus, tumor cell suppression of these 
pathways may result in potent immune evasion and highlights the 
importance of cytokines in driving antitumor immunity.
Using similar genetic approaches, recent studies also identified 
genes within the IFN- and antigen presentation pathways as key 
immune evasion genes (14, 15). However, these genes were identi-
fied using a tumor cell line with preexisting resistance to TNF- 
induced cell death; thus, the global immune evasion network was 
not fully appreciated. Cell line selection for genome-wide screens is 
critical, because cell lines diverge in their sensitivity to different as-
pects of immune pressure. Here, we selected a variety of tumor cell 
lines for our immune-based screens to allow for a more comprehen-
sive analysis of the pathways that are necessary for robust antitumor 
immune responses. We posit that our screens in B16 melanoma cells 
and MC38 colon cancer cells have provided extensive, but certainly 
not exhaustive, insight into immune evasion mechanisms. CRISPR 
screening itself is a powerful, nonbiased method for identifying 
genes that play an important role in a biological process. Here, we 
have used immune pressure on tumor cells to identify genes that, 
when deleted, provide resistance to immune cell killing. Although it 
is known that tumor cells frequently suppress expression of par-
ticular genes as an immune escape mechanism, including MHC-I, 
they often mutate key genes such as tp53 to provide a growth advan-
tage. Gene mutations that reduce the efficacy of immunotherapy 
have recently been identified, including mutations in Janus kinases 
(JAK) providing resistance to anti–PD-1 therapy (9). Thus, a limitation 
of CRISPR screening that may arise as the effect of gene deletion, not 
genetic mutation, is investigated. However, because we detected JAK1/2 
as key immune evasion genes in our screens, the phenotype that arises 
through CRISPR-based deletions can mimic loss-of-function muta-
tions that arise in cancer patients. As previously reported (14, 15), our 
screens identified the IFN- and antigen presentation pathways, in 
addition to the TNF pathway, as important for antitumor immunity. 
The presence of genetic alterations in each of these pathways in can-
cer patients with poor prognosis (9, 19) provides confidence in the 
physiological significance of our discoveries. However, we recognize 
that other proteins and pathways important for immune cell–mediated 
tumor surveillance very likely exist and await further discovery and 
analysis.
Our screening approach revealed a somewhat unappreciated 
role for the TNF pathway, and bystander TNF-mediated cell death, 
in antitumor immunity. Cytotoxic lymphocytes use a variety of ef-
fector mechanisms to control tumors, including direct target cell kill-
ing via synapse-dependent granzyme delivery (20). However, our

results suggest that this is not a process disengaged by tumors to 
avoid T cell– and NK cell–mediated death. Instead, we propose a 
model whereby the cytotoxic synapse with a tumor cell triggers TNF 
and IFN- production from the T or NK cell (21, 22). If the tumor 
is intrinsically TNF-sensitive, then TNF will initiate apoptosis of 
surrounding tumor cells in a bystander effect (22–25), which may 
be a more effective way to kill a larger tumor cell mass. However, as 
a consequence, tumor cells may acquire resistance to bystander T or 
NK cell attack, having never been the subject of direct recognition 
through the cytotoxic synapse (9, 10, 22, 26). Many tumor cell lines 
are intrinsically resistant to TNF treatment in vitro, but the molec-
ular mechanism that determines this sensitivity threshold is not ful-
ly understood. The resistance to TNF-mediated killing may be due 
to the relative expression levels of TNF receptor–associated anti- 
apoptotic proteins such as cFLIP, cIAPs, and caspase-8 (27–29). Our 
screens revealed that loss of caspase-8 was the most frequently tar-
geted TNF receptor complex component that drives immune eva-
sion. Caspase-8 is frequently lost or functionally mutated in several 
tumor types (19, 30, 31) and represents an attractive protein for tu-
mor cells to target, because loss of its enzymatic activity entirely 
eliminates the apoptotic potential of TNF, but not the nuclear factor 
B (NFĸB) activation signal, which can promote cell proliferation 
and survival (27).
Our study also identified a number of genes not previously impli-
cated in antitumor immunity or resistance to immunotherapy. These 
included Gosr1, a trafficking membrane protein that transports pro-
teins among the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus (32). 
Our results demonstrated that loss of Gosr1 facilitates resistance to 
T cell–mediated tumor control both in vitro and in vivo. Although our 
study did not address the mechanism behind this, Gosr1 was identified 
as a prognostic marker in a number of cancer types and highlights the 
power of unbiased screens to identify new markers of resistance to 
antitumor immunity and immunotherapy. One gene encoding an 
uncharacterized protein that scored highly in our screens was Ado. 
Deletion of Ado provided protection against TNF-mediated cell 
death in a number of tumor lines and provided resistance to immune- 
mediated tumor control in vivo. Depletion of Ado did not affect 
transcriptional responses to TNF but did result in disrupted cysteine 
metabolism and polyamine synthesis pathways. Polyamine path-
way metabolites can modulate sensitivity to TNF-induced cell death 
(33), and this may provide a functional link between depletion of Ado 
and immune evasion through loss of TNF-mediated cell death, al-
though this remains to be formally demonstrated in our experimen-
tal systems. This finding highlights the potentially underappreciated 
role of cysteine metabolism in TNF biology. Further studies will be 
required to determine exactly how loss of Ado inhibits TNF-induced 
apoptosis through deregulated cellular metabolism and how this af-
fects tumor cell survival. We also found that depletion of two other 
genes encoding proteins associated with TNF signaling and cell death, 
sequestosome-1 (Sqstm1) (34) and spermatogenesis-associated protein 
2 (Spata2) (35, 36), resulted in resistance to T cell– or NK cell–mediated 
killing. Spata2, in particular, was identified in a number of recent studies 
as a key molecule required for TNF-induced, receptor- 
interacting pro-
tein kinase 1 (RIPK1)–dependent apoptosis (36). In addition to direct 
inhibition of TNF-mediated apoptosis through death receptor sig-
naling, these findings provide an additional pathway for tumors to 
target to evade cell death mediated by cytotoxic lymphocytes.
Our study, and those previously reported (14, 15), identified the 
IFN- and antigen presentation pathways as important for anti-
tumor immunity, but our additional finding that the TNF pathway 
is targeted as an immune evasion mechanism may be important thera-
peutically. Agents that sensitize tumor cells to TNF-induced apop-
tosis, such as smac mimetics, are currently undergoing clinical trials 
for a variety of solid and hematological cancers (37, 38). Thus, com-
bining immunotherapies, such as anti–PD-1 (which enhances T cell 
TNF production), with smac mimetics may yield potent antitumor 
responses (11, 39). Similarly, using smac mimetics to increase the 
cytotoxic potential of adoptive cellular therapies is an exciting possi-
bility. Understanding the major effector pathways used by cytotoxic 
lymphocytes through functional screens, such as those presented here, is 
critical for the generation of future targeted immune-based therapies.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
All animal studies were conducted under a protocol approved by the 
Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre Animal Experimentation Ethics 
Committee and according to their guidelines.
Antibodies and reagents
Neutralizing antibodies used were as follows: anti-TNF (BioLegend) 
clone MP6-XT22, anti–PD-1 clone RMP1-14, and anti–IFN- clone 
R4-6A2 (BioXCell). Recombinant TNF and IFN- were from PeproTech.
Cells and cell lines
The cell lines MC38 and B16, and derivatives expressing chicken Ova, 
were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented 
with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco) 
and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO2. OT-I T cells from wild-type or perforin- 
deficient (Prf1−/−) mice were activated from spleens with the chicken 
Ova peptide SIINFEKL. Activated T cells were used on days 5 to 10 and 
had a typical effector phenotype (CD8+CD69+CD25+CD62L−CD44+). 
OT-I T cells and NK cells were cultured in RPMI supplemented with 
10% FCS, l-glutamine, penicillin/streptomycin, nonessential amino 
acids, sodium pyruvate, Hepes, 2-mercaptoethanol, and interleukin-2 
(100 IU/ml).
Time-lapse microscopy
MC38Ova cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein diacetate suc-
cinimidyl ester (CFSE) or CellTrace Violet for 20 min and then 
washed and mixed together in a 50:50 ratio. Cells were then seeded 
into each well of an eight-well chamber slide (Ibidi, Munich, Germany) 
and incubated overnight at 37°C/10% CO2. OT-I T cells were then 
added to adherent targets, in medium containing 100 M propidium 
iodide (PI). Chamber slides were mounted on a heated stage within 
a temperature-controlled chamber maintained at 37°C, and constant 
CO2 concentrations (5 or 7%) were infused using a gas incuba-
tion system with active gas mixer (“The Brick”; Ibidi). Optical sections 
were acquired through sequential scans or brightfield/differential 
interference contrast on a TCS SP5 confocal microscope (Leica Mi-
crosystems, Deerfield, IL) using a ~40 Å (numerical aperture, 0.85) 
air objective and Leica LAS AF software. Image analysis was performed 
using MetaMorph Imaging Series 7 software (Universal Imaging, 
Downingtown, PA).
3′ mRNA sequencing
RNA extraction, library preparation, and data analysis were performed 
as described previously (1). Briefly, total RNA was isolated as per

the manufacturer’s instructions (NucleoSpin RNA Extraction kit, 
Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA). Subsequently, the RNA was analyzed 
on the TapeStation (Agilent TapeStation 2200), and only RNA with 
RNA integrity number values greater than 9 were used for down-
stream library preparation. The QuantSeq 3′ mRNA Library Prep Kit 
(Lexogen) was used to prepare libraries. The 3′ mRNA sequencing 
libraries were sequenced single-end 75 base pairs (bp) on the NextSeq 
500 (Illumina). The resulting reads were demultiplexed using CASAVA 
1.8, and sample quality control was performed using FastQC (Babraham 
Bioinformatics, Babraham Institute). The reads were trimmed using 
cutadapt (v1.7) and subsequently aligned to the mouse reference genome 
(GRCm38/mm10) using HISAT2 (v2.1.0), after which read counting 
was performed using FeatureCounts from the Subread package (v1.5.0). 
Differential gene expression analysis was performed using Voom- 
LIMMA. GSEA was performed using GSEA (v3.0).
Genome-wide and targeted CRISPR screens
Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens were performed using MC38, 
MC38Ova, B16Ova, and MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with mCherry- 
Cas9 (FUCas9Cherry). The mouse cell lines MC38-Cas9, MC38Ova- 
Cas9, 
and B16Ova-Cas9 cells were transduced with the Brie genome-wide 
sgRNA library (40), and the human cell line MDA-MB-231 was trans-
duced with the Brunello genome-wide sgRNA library. Transductions 
were performed at a multiplicity of infection of 0.3 to ensure integra-
tion of single sgRNA constructs per cell. After transduction, the cells 
were selected with puromycin (5 g/ml) for 5 days. The immune eva-
sion screening was started at 7 days after transduction, after which 
the T0 time point was taken as a reference. The MC38Ova-Cas9 cells were 
cocultured with activated Prf1+/+ and Prf1−/− OT-I T cells, or NK cells, 
at effector to target (E:T) ratios of 1:20 and 1:10, respectively. The 
B16Ova-Cas9 cells were cocultured with Prf1+/+ and Prf1−/− OT-I T cells 
at E:T ratios of 1:5 and 1:1, respectively. MDA-MB-231 cells were cocul-
tured with HER2-directed CAR T cells at an E:T ratio of 1:5. The tumor 
cells were exposed to a total of three hits with either OT-I T or NK cells, 
after which the pellets were snap-frozen. An untreated control was 
taken along as a reference for all cell lines. Genomic DNA extraction 
was subsequently performed using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit 
(Qiagen), and libraries were prepared as described previously (41). 
The libraries were subsequently multiplexed and run on the NextSeq 
500 (Illumina) generating 75-bp single-end reads. After demultiplex-
ing with CASAVA (v1.8), the vector-derived sequence reads were 
removed, and only reads of exactly 20 bp were extracted using cutadapt 
(v1.7). Subsequently, MAGeCK (v0.5.6) was used to count the reads 
and perform gene/sgRNA enrichment and statistical analysis (42). 
The resulting data were visualized using the R package ggplots2. 
The targeted CRISPR library was composed of the top scoring genes 
from the MC38 screens, and the libraries were custom-cloned from 
oligo pools obtained from CustomArray Inc.
In vivo CRISPR screens
MC38Ova cells expressing Cas9 mCherry were transduced with a 
custom-cloned immune evasion library into pLenti-puro sgRNA 
vector as described above. After puromycin selection for 7 days, 1 × 106 
cells were implanted subcutaneously into recipient NSG mice. When 
tumors reached 30 to 50 mm2, mice were injected with 5 × 106 SIINFEKL- 
activated OT-I T cells (days 6 to 8 after activation). Four days after 
mice received either a single dose (Prf1+/+) or two doses (Prf1−/−) of 
OT-I T cells, tumors were isolated. Genomic DNA isolation and li-
brary preparation were conducted as described above.
Metabolomics profiling
Control or Ado knockout cells were maintained in full growth medium. 
Medium was aspirated, and wells were washed with normal saline. 
Cells were snap-frozen by addition of liquid nitrogen to cell culture plates 
immediately after washing. For metabolite extraction, ice-cold MeOH/ 
CHCl3 (9:1, v/v) containing 13C-sorbitol and 13C,15N-valine internal 
standards was added. Cells and metabolite-containing supernatants 
were collected, and insoluble material was pelleted by centrifugation 
at 16,000g for 5 min. Polar metabolites were prepared for analysis 
by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) as previously 
described (43) and analyzed using a Shimadzu GC-TQ8040 instru-
ment with metabolites identified and quantified using the Shimadzu 
Smart Database. Primary and secondary amines were identified and 
quantified relative to authentic standards, using a Shimadzu LC-TQ8050 
instrument after derivatization of amine-containing metabolites, as 
previously described (44). Raw peak areas of individual metabolites 
were normalized to the total peak area in each sample. Adjusted 
data are presented as fold change in metabolite abundance relative 
to control.
T cell killing assays
Specific OT-I T cell killing was measured using chromium release 
assays at the indicated target to effector (T:E), as previously described 
in detail (45).
