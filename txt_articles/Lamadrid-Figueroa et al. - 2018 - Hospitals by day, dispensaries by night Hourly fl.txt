Abstract
Background
Quality of obstetric care may not be constant within clinics and hospitals. Night shifts and
weekends experience understaffing and other organizational hurdles in comparison with the
weekday morning shifts, and this may influence the risk of maternal deaths.
Objective
To analyze the hourly variation of maternal mortality within Mexican health institutions.
Methods
We performed a cross-sectional multivariate analysis of 3,908 maternal deaths and
10,589,444 births that occurred within health facilities in Mexico during the 2010–2014
period, using data from the Health Information Systems of the Mexican Ministry of Health.
We fitted negative binomial regression models with covariate adjustment to all data, as well
as similar models by basic cause of death and by weekdays/weekends. The outcome was
the Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR), defined as the number of deaths occurred per 100,000
live births. Hour of day was the main predictor; covariates were day of the week, c-section,
marginalization, age, education, and number of pregnancies.
Results
Risk rises during early morning, reaching 52.5 deaths per 100,000 live births at 6:00 (95%
UI: 46.3, 62.2). This is almost twice the lowest risk, which occurred at noon (27.1 deaths per
100,000 live births [95% U.I.: 23.0, 32.0]). Risk shows peaks coinciding with shift changes,
at 07:00, and 14:00 and was significantly higher on weekends and holidays.

 Conclusions
Evidence suggests strong hourly fluctuations in the risk of maternal death with during early
morning hours and around the afternoon shift change. These results may reflect institutional
management problems that cause an uneven quality of obstetric care.
Introduction
Maternal mortality has been studied since at least the mid-18th century, thanks to the existence
of long time series of vital statistics in Sweden and the United Kingdom [1,2]]. In Mexico,
despite counting on vital statistics of maternal deaths practically from the early 20th century,
information was only consolidated beginning in 1940 [3]]. In 1940 a maternal death occurred
every 2 hours or 13 per day, whereas by 2014 this decreased to one death every 8 hours or 3
per day. However, the trend in the number of births is opposite, thus the Maternal Mortality
Ratio (MMR) fell 92.3% over this period. Between 1940 and 1980, the MMR decreased 6-fold
falling from 536 to 95 deaths per 100,000 live births; in the following 20 years it halved falling
from 94 to 47, and after the year 2000 the decline has been only 13% [3].
In terms of measurement, important advancements in the registration of maternal deaths
have occurred in Mexico. After the implementation of the Intentional Search and Reclassifica-
tion of Maternal Deaths System (BIRMM, acronym in Spanish) in 2002, approximately 20%
maternal deaths originally classified as non-maternal deaths were recovered [4–6]. Due to
improving registries, indirect maternal deaths have been analyzed with a greater degree of cer-
tainty [7], as well as the contribution of late maternal deaths and obstetric sequelae deaths to
maternal mortality in Mexico [8]. Nevertheless, despite the gains in the measurement of
maternal mortality, the MMR has not declined as expected, which points to insufficient knowl-
edge of its determinants. Once regarded as one of the most important factors in explaining
maternal deaths in Mexico: access to health services has dramatically improved. According to
publicly available data from the Ministry of Health, 98% of all deliveries in Mexico in the
2010–2014 period occurred in a clinic or hospital. However, 83% of all maternal deaths
occurred within these same facilities. Taken together, these numbers point to the problem of
lingering maternal mortality being related to the quality of obstetric care within institutions.
This study seeks to use the good quality information on maternal mortality in Mexico to
identify its determinants. Of particular interest is a seldom studied factor, which is the hour
and day of the week on which death occurs as a function of variations in the continuum of the
quality of maternal care within health facilities. Discussion on varying health outcomes as a
function of the hour of day, due to understaffing and other problems outside the usual “office
hours” has been going on for several years [9], with at least one study estimating an association
between “out-of-hours” births and neonatal mortality in the UK.[10]. A larger number of stud-
ies have been conducted however, on daily variations in clinical outcomes, collectively called
the “weekend effect”.[11–14] Evidence from the UK shows a weekend effect on perinatal mor-
tality and obstetric practices, which begs the question on whether similar variations could
occur during the course of a single day[15,16].
An old saying among Mexican health professionals states that hospitals in Mexico are “hos-
pitals by morning, clinics by the afternoon, and dispensaries by night”; this adage is a reflection
of widespread anecdotal observations about hourly fluctuations of the quality of care in Mexi-
can hospitals, which if actually true, should cause risk variations within the course of a day.
Consequently, we set out to explore the relationship between maternal deaths and the hour of

 day, to ascertain whether hourly risk fluctuations are consistent with what would be expected
if quality of obstetric care does indeed vary in 24 hour cycles.
Methods
The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Institute of Public Health of
Mexico (authorization number CI: 1340).
Data sources
We obtained data on 5,232 pregnancy-related deaths and 10,781,915 births occurred during
the 2010–2014 period from datasets of the BIRMM and the Ministry of Health Birth Informa-
tion Subsystem (SINAC, acronym in Spanish), respectively. We retrieved information on the
place and conditions of the death or birth, as well as sociodemographic characteristics and
obstetric history of the mother. Additionally, we obtained information on the Marginalization
Index of the mother’s place of residence, a measure defined at the municipality level that sum-
marizes access to education, proper housing, income and remoteness of dwellings [17].
Variable definitions
Births, maternal deaths and maternal mortality ratio.
We retrieved information on the
4,363 pregnancy related deaths and 10,589,444 births that occurred within a medical facility in
Mexico during the study period, thus excluding 16.6% of all pregnancy related deaths and
1.8% of births, which occurred at home, or in public places. As for MMR calculation purposes
maternal deaths are those that occurred during pregnancy or within 42 days after the termina-
tion of pregnancy; we excluded 455 late maternal deaths (deaths from any obstetric cause
occurring more than 42 days but less than one year after delivery; ICD-10 code O96) and
deaths due to sequelae of obstetric causes (deaths from any direct obstetric cause occurring
one year or more after delivery; ICD-10 code O97) from the analysis, thus yielding a final ana-
lytic sample of 3,908 deaths. The performance of a c-section was included as a covariate. The
unadjusted or crude MMR was obtained dividing the number of deaths by the number of live
births [18].
Time of day, community and facility level variables.
The time of day in which deaths
occurred was the main independent variable, and it was defined as integer numbers from 0 to
23. From the date of death or delivery, we obtained the day of the week and a dichotomous var-
iable that indicated whether it corresponded to a working day (Monday to Friday) or a non-
working day (Saturdays, Sundays or holidays). We considered the geographical region within
Mexico defined as north, central, and south, following the proposal of the National Health and
Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT, acronym in Spanish) 2012 [19]. The marginalization index of
the municipality of residence was grouped it into three categories (high or very high, average,
and low or very low) [17].
Individual level covariates.
The mother’s age, years of schooling, type of health insur-
ance, and number of previous pregnancies were included as covariates. Age was categorized
into 10-year groups. Years of education was grouped into four categories (0–5, 6–8, 9–11 and
12 or more). The number of previous pregnancies was grouped into three categories (0, 1 and
2 or more).
Causes of death.
Basic causes of death were grouped into nine mutually exclusive catego-
ries as defined by the ICD-10[18]: abortion; hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, delivery and
puerperium; obstetric hemorrhage; pregnancy related infections; other obstetric complications;
unforeseen treatment complications; non-obstetric complications, undetermined; other codes

 of interest and contributing conditions. The complete classification appears in the Appendix
(S1 File).
Statistical analysis
Data quality.
In order to improve the completeness of the datasets we imputed missing
and non-specified data using the Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations method (MICE)
[20]. In order to evaluate the plausibility of the imputations, we compared their distribution to
that of observed data [21]. The percentage of imputed values varied by covariate, ranging from
0.2% in the case of level of marginalization in the municipality of residence to 5.7% in the case
of type of health insurance (S1 Table).
Merger of deaths and births datasets.
Deaths and births information are stored in two
separate datasets that cannot be merged by normal means at the individual level as there is a
lack of an identifying variable. Thus, we collapsed individual level data was into covariate pat-
terns (groupings of observations that share the same values of the covariates of interest), form-
ing a multidimensional contingency table. Each cell of said table contains the number of
deaths and births that occurred for women with that exact pattern of covariates during the
study period.
Adjusting for the time-wise correlation between births and deaths.
Since most of
maternal deaths occurred nearly after the moment of birth, it is expected for the variability
cycles of death as a function of time at any given day to closely match the analog cycles of
births during the same day. However, peaks and valleys in the death and birth functions are
not in harmony, as deaths do not tend to occur immediately at the moment of birth but rather
some time after it; thus a simplistic analysis dividing the number of deaths occurred at any par-
ticular hour by the number of births occurred in the same lapse would likely produce biased
risk estimates. Given this, we analyzed fluctuations of births as a function of time, introducing
lags in the hour of birth (in 1 hour increments), thus displacing the birth function seeking to
maximize its Pearson’s correlation to the death function, as long as the lag was not larger than
12 hours. The optimal estimated lag to harmonize the daily fluctuations of deaths and births
was 2 hours, achieving a Pearson’s correlation of 0.68 between the functions (This means the
typical maternal death in Mexican hospitals occurs 2 hours after delivery). The displacement
and harmonization of both functions is apparent on Fig 1. Lags varied by cause of death,
thus we adjusted each stratified model with the optimal lag that maximized the correlation
between the birth and death functions; the complete lag analysis results appear in the Appen-
dix (S1 File).
MMR estimation.
We fitted negative binomial regression models to estimate covariate-
adjusted MMR and 95% uncertainty intervals (95% U.I.). Uncertainty intervals are numeri-
cally and analytically equivalent to confidence intervals, however, since we analyzed census-
type data of deaths and births, the standard errors do not convey their usual sense of “sam-
pling” error, but rather the volatility of the parameters given by the variability in death counts.

Where MDp is the number of maternal deaths occurred within covariate pattern p; Bp is the

ously described explanatory variables and βpj is a vector of regression parameters.

 For simplicity’s sake, we use the term “risk” as a synonymous of MMR in the results section.
All the analyses were performed with Stata v 15.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). All esti-
mates with a p<0.05 were considered to be statistically significant.
Results
The characteristics of the study population appear in Table 1. The MMR within the Mexican
health institutions was 36.9 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births during the 2010 to 2014
period, which was somewhat lower than the overall MMR (43.8 deaths per 100,000 live births).
The lowest MMR occurred during the morning shift, especially between 09:00 am and
13:00, and the highest occurred during the night shift, with the afternoon shift in an intermedi-
ate position. Risk was significantly higher during early morning hours: 44.2 (95% U.I. 41.1,
47.6) deaths per 100,000 live births between 00:00 am and 08:00 am; this was 63% higher than
the lowest MMR during the day, occurring at 12:00 (27.1 deaths per 100,000 live births [95%
U.I.: 23.0, 32.0]) and 55% greater than the risk occurring between 09:00 and 12:00 (29.1 deaths

 We observed that the MMR shows peaks (local maxima) that roughly coincide with shift
change hours: that at 06:00–07:00, and another one at 14:00 (MMR = 42.5, which is 25% higher
than the MMR at 13:00, and 41% higher than that at 15:00). We also observe a crescent linear
trend from 00:00 culminating at 07:00 (Fig 2). The complete model estimates are shown in
supplemental S2 Table.
Daily risk fluctuations were much sharper from Mondays to Fridays; during weekends we
did not observe such large fluctuations, but it is noteworthy that the overall MMR during holi-
days was significantly larger than that of weekdays (40.1 vs. 35.7, respectively, p = 0.02). We
also observed that the MMR during weekends and holidays can be classified in two large
blocks: it tends to remain below or near the mean from 08:00 to 17:00, and above the mean
from 17:00 to 07:00 the next morning (Fig 3).
Analyzing hourly risk by specific maternal causes, we observed fluctuations in hemorrhage
mortality, with a 2-fold wide gap between the lowest risk, occurring at 10:00 (5.3 deaths due to
hemorrhage per 100,000 live births) and the highest (11.5 deaths due to hemorrhage per

 100,000 live births), occurring at 6:00. In the case of deaths due to hypertensive disorders, a
much sharper peak occurred at 20:00 and another one at 7:00 (12.9 deaths per 100,000 live
births). Deaths by indirect causes followed the same general pattern with an elevated risk
between 7:00 and 8:00 that, in the latter case, was 2.65 times higher than the risk observed at
11:00 (Fig 4).
Finally, with the above results we proposed two hypothetical scenarios aiming to advance
the concept of avoidable deaths. Data showed that there was a daily time span with much
lower mortality between 9:00 and 12:00. In an ideal scenario in which the MMR could uni-
formly be lowered to levels experienced in Mexican institutions between 9:00 and 12:00 (29.1
deaths per 100,000 live births), 834 deaths could have been avoided during the study period
(95% U.I.: 538, 1098). Moreover, if the MMR could be lowered to the lowest observed (at
12:00: 27.1 deaths per 100,000 live births), 1045 deaths (95% U.I.: 527, 1478), could have been
averted during the period, corresponding to 38% of all maternal deaths occurred within Mexi-
can health facilities between 2010 and 2014.
Discussion
Main findings
We confirmed an increased risk during the night shift, particularly during early morning
hours; regardless of the cause of death. Additionally a weekend effect on maternal mortality
was evident, as well as a particular pattern of excess maternal mortality around shift changes. If
the institutional MMR in Mexico would have uniformly been at its minimum value of 27.1,
which occurred at noon, the overall country MMR during the 2010–2014 period (excluding
late and sequelae-related maternal deaths) would have been 34.1 deaths per 100,000 live births;
22% less than the observed MMR of 44 deaths per 100,000 live births.
Strengths and limitations
We offer a systemic analysis of the MMR, in spite of the limitations of the available data, pre-
senting a simple way to incorporate factors related to access and quality of health services into

 the analyses, contributing to the study of organizational determinants of maternal deaths.
Moreover, conclusions are supported from analyzing data from a vast majority of deaths and
births (close to a census) occurred in the country’s hospitals and clinics during the study
period, and are thus mostly free of sampling error.
The most important limitation of the analysis is that the construction of the MMR is not
defined at the individual woman, as we are linking deaths and births based solely on the timing
of their occurrence, constructing a dataset where observations correspond to covariate pat-
terns and not to individual women; with the drawback that individual level predictions are
impossible. It would be a far better approach to identify the outcome of each particular preg-
nancy in terms of eventual death or survival; however limitations of the data make it
impossible.
Due to limitations of the data, some confounding may be present as women that seek atten-
tion during night hours may be different than those who are cared for in the morning hours,
which include women programmed for elective cesarean section or delivery induction;
women seeking care at night may inherently have an urgency (and higher risk) as otherwise
they might decide to wait until the morning to seek attention. The ability to adjust for the

 performance of a c-section, accounts for potential confounding due to elective cesareans (theo-
retically low risk) being performed mostly during the morning shift. Some residual confound-
ing may persist however because of our inability to distinguish between elective and
emergency procedures. It is important to note, however, that night-day patient differences
could not account for the risk peak occurring around the afternoon shift.
Another important limitation is that in order to establish causal relationships of death with
factors such as understaffing, the relevant time would not be that of death itself but rather that
of the critical event or events that led to death (which are of course the most important in
terms of future prevention). The problem is that these may have occurred hours or even days
before. For example: a critical event such as a stroke due to a poorly treated eclampsia could
occur around 9 AM with death following at 9 PM; if this happens we could be wrongly attrib-
uting death to events occurring at night which is clearly not the case. If one views hour of
death as a proxy of the hour of the critical event that led to it, then the resulting misclassifica-
tion of the outcome variable could indeed bias the results in a way that is hard to predict and
increase the uncertainty in the estimates; we believe however that bias is attenuated by the lag
introduced in the analyses.
Finally our analysis is not inclusive of 17% of deaths and 2% of births that occurred outside
health facilities during the study period. Although this might seem as a limitation, we believe
adding them to the analysis would obscure the patterns made evident by our work. Time pat-
terns within the health system reflect mostly on issues of uneven quality of care, whereas
deaths occurred outside the system almost surely follow different time patterns that respond to
different determinants.
Interpretation
In Mexico, maternal mortality has indeed decreased, but not to the extent that was hoped for
[22][23]. Few studies on maternal mortality determinants have tried to adjust for confounders
or to incorporate analytical variables related to the organization of health services provision;
this study does both and shows results of the hourly excess maternal deaths within Mexican
hospitals.
The study of the effect of hour and day of the week on the quality and outcomes of health
services seeks to ascertain whether outcomes such as mortality, prolonged stays, complica-
tions, etc. are related to the time on which services were provided. Palmer et al [16] studied 1.3
million obstetric events in United Kingdom hospitals during 2015, finding 7% greater odds of
perinatal deaths in weekend admissions compared to weekday admissions. These same authors
stated that should this “weekend effect” be eliminated, up to 770 perinatal deaths would have
been avoided during the studied period. Some studies in other hospital areas showed no week-
end effect on mortality [24], although most studies do show an increased risk of dying related
to weekend admissions. When the shift or hour of admission has been analyzed, results have
shown an excess risk for patients during the night shift [25], which could be explained by
understaffing and a lack of equipment or consumables needed to solve emergencies. A study
of hospital discharge records of the USA showed excess mortality on hospitals with a small
number of doctors and nurses [26]. Shulkin (2008) discussed how quality of health care varies
between shifts, with night shifts and weekends being the worst performers possibly due to the
absence of directive personnel, and overall scarcity of staff [8]. In Mexico, there appears to be a
wide gap between shifts at different hours of day. To put numbers in context, the lowest MMR
estimated in our study of 27.1 at noon is comparable to that of the United States (2016 esti-
mates), while the highest, at 52.5, is comparable to that of Iraq or the Maldives.[27] This varia-
tion is worrisome as patients need constant quality care 24 hours a day, consequences of the

 opposite being higher mortality and readmissions rates, more surgical complications and
more possibilities of medical errors.
Recent studies in the UK, specifically tested for whether a 24-hour presence of an obstetri-
cian in the labour ward, resulted in improved outcomes for women and newborn [28,29]
Although no significant association was found, the situation in Mexico around this specific
matter may not be comparable for a variety of reasons. Firstly, maternal and neonatal mortality
rates in Mexico are much higher than in the UK (maternal mortality was estimated to be
almost seven times as high and neonatal mortality almost three times as high in 2016)[30]. Sec-
ondly, factors such as lack of antenatal care are quite common in Mexico and bear heavily in
the outcome of the pregnancy, thus making the presence of experienced staff at the moment of
delivery much more crucial as complications are likelier to arise [31]. In the UK, most low-risk
deliveries are attended by experienced professional midwives. Midwives are very scarce in
Mexico and many, if not most, institutional deliveries are attended by Medical Interns (5th
year medical students), whom frequently lack the experience or knowledge to properly identify
or manage emerging problems during delivery; at least one study in Mexico has documented
an important lack of use for evidence based-practices inside health facilities [32]. This makes
the presence of an obstetrician in the labour ward much more relevant. Lastly, understaffing is
not limited to obstetricians, but also to other key personnel such as anesthesiologists and
nurses, which causes a delay in case of the need for an emergency cesarean section, for
instance.
Finally, we could not locate literature documenting excess risk around shift changes, which
are characterized by an exchange of information between the departing and arriving personnel
in any hospital area. Shift change handovers comprise particular technical, ethical and organi-
zational culture aspects that have been seldom studied, but have been recognized as difficult
and probably important determinants of the quality of care [26].
Conclusions
The findings of this study do not allow us to reach direct conclusions regarding the individual
risk of dying due to maternal causes within Mexican hospitals and clinics as causal inferences
are impossible due to the limitations of secondary data analyses. Rather, these results allow us
to advance new hypotheses about the maternal mortality phenomenon, which are presumably
relevant for most countries. More in-depth studies that collect first-hand data are needed to
further understand the factors behind the excess mortality that occurs around shift changes, as
well as that during night shifts and weekends. Accounting and adjusting for individual patient
differences in the nocturnal vs. diurnal shifts is crucial if causal relations between factors such
as understaffing and mortality risk are to be confirmed. Regardless of future research on the
matter, the implementation of routine Maternal Deaths Surveillance and Response efforts is
crucial to fully delineate the critical events that lead to death in each particular case [32], thus
allowing for eventually successful preventive actions.
The evidence made available by our study, if eventually confirmed, calls for new ways to
improve the organization of obstetric care services and highlights the importance of imple-
menting health policies that foster full staffing during night shifts and weekends. In the United
Kingdom, for example, after introduction of an enhanced, consultant-led weekend service in
acute medicine programme, in-hospital mortality was significantly reduced [33]. Another pos-
sible option would be pay per performance; hospitals also need to publicize their out-of-hours
improvements in a consumer-friendly way to help patients make informed decisions (http://
patientcarelink.org), to achieve a competitive environment. Hospital administrators should
also be aware of the situations that hospitals face, take into account the views and needs of

 staff, and pay more attention to the needs of patients and their families [9]. All this would
improve quality of care thus avoiding unnecessary deaths.
It is important to consider that Mexico fell short of reaching the Millenium Development
Goal No. 5 for the country and is having problems dealing with Sustainable Development Goal
3.1. To reach these commitments, we have to look for maternal deaths that can potentially be
avoided, and one way to do that is by reaching a better, and constant, quality of care. We need
to move towards increasing the availability of health providers at all times, not only with resi-
dents and students, but rather with fully staffed hospitals and clinics in order to guarantee the
best possible health care 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
