BACKGROUND: Evidence from animal studies suggests that exposure to organophosphate flame retardants (PFRs) can disrupt endocrine function and
impair embryo development. However, no epidemiologic studies have been conducted to evaluate effects on fertility and pregnancy outcomes.
OBJECTIVES: We evaluated associations between urinary concentrations of PFR metabolites and outcomes of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment
among couples recruited from an academic fertility clinic.
METHODS: This analysis included 211 women enrolled in the Environment And Reproductive Health (EARTH) prospective cohort study (2005–
2015) who provided one or two urine samples per IVF cycle. We measured five urinary PFR metabolites [bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate
(BDCIPP), diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-PPP), tert-butylphenyl phenyl phosphate (tb-PPP), and bis(1-chloro-2-
propyl) phosphate (BCIPP)] using negative electrospray ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Molar concentra-
tions of the urinary PFR metabolites were summed. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the association of the PFR
metabolites with IVF outcomes, accounting for multiple IVF cycles per woman.
RESULTS: Detection frequencies were high for BDCIPP (87%), DPHP (94%), and ip-PPP (80%), but low for tb-PPP (14%) and BCIPP (0%).
We observed decreased success for several IVF outcomes across increasing quartiles of both summed and individual PFR metabolites (DPHP
and ip-PPP) in our adjusted multivariable models. Significant declines in adjusted means from the lowest to highest quartile of RPFR were
observed for the proportion of cycles resulting in successful fertilization (10% decrease), implantation (31%), clinical pregnancy (41%), and live
birth (38%).
Conclusions: Using IVF to investigate human reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, we found that concentrations of some urinary PFR metabolites
were negatively associated with proportions of successful fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy, and live birth. https://doi.org/10.1289/

Introduction
One in six couples worldwide is affected by infertility, which is
defined as the inability to get pregnant after 1 y or more of unpro-
tected intercourse (Chandra et al. 2005), and a recent U.S. study
found that pregnancy loss (miscarriage) affected approximately
28% of couples planning a pregnancy (Buck Louis et al. 2016).
These figures will likely rise as the postponement of childbearing
increases in developed regions of the world. Infertility has an
associated health-care cost in the billions of dollars per year, not
including the physical and psychological burden placed on the
couple (Connolly et al. 2010). Both the high rates of fertility
along with the associated high costs highlight the need to
improve our understanding of risk factors that impair the ability
to have a child.
One potential risk factor is environmental exposure. Several
classes of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) with wide-
spread general population exposure, including pesticides and
phthalates, have been linked to infertility and adverse pregnancy
outcomes (Di Renzo et al. 2015). While there are hundreds or
more EDCs, only a fraction have been evaluated for effects on
infertility and pregnancy (Gore et al. 2015). Organophosphate
flame retardants (PFRs) are a class of EDCs with ubiquitous ex-
posure that have been detected in 90–100% of adult urine samples
(Butt et al. 2014, 2016; Carignan et al. 2013a; Hammel et al.
2016; Hoffman et al. 2014; Meeker et al. 2013a). Over the past
decade, PFRs have been used widely in the polyurethane foam
of upholstered furniture as replacements for pentabromodi-
phenyl ether, a flame retardant mixture that was phased out of
use in 2005 (Stapleton et al. 2009). These chemicals are not
chemically bonded to foam and have been shown to migrate
into the air and dust of indoor environments (van der Veen and
de Boer 2012). The PFR triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) is used as
part of flame retardant mixtures in polyurethane foam as well as
in a variety of other applications, including as a plasticizer
(WHO 1991).
Animal studies indicate that exposure to PFRs can disrupt
endocrine function through altered thyroid action, steroidogen-
esis, or estrogen metabolism, and can also impair embryo de-
velopment (Farhat et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2013; Wang et al.
2015). Reductions in sperm motility and increased serum total
T3 levels were associated with increasing PFR exposures in a
small study of men (Meeker et al. 2013b); however, no studies
have investigated the effect of PFRs on pregnancy outcomes.
Therefore, we explored the association between urinary con-
centrations of PFRs and pregnancy outcomes among women in
a prospective cohort study, the Environment And Reproductive
Health (EARTH) study, using assisted reproductive technolo-
gies (ART) as a model to study early developmental endpoints
and pregnancy outcomes.

Research
 Methods
Participants
Study participants were women recruited into the EARTH study,
which was established in June 2004 to evaluate environmental
and dietary determinants of fertility from patients undergoing
ART at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Fertility
Center. Women between the ages of 18 and 46 were eligible to
participate, and approximately 60% of those contacted by the
research nurses enrolled in the study. The EARTH study was
approved by the Human Studies Institutional Review Boards of
the MGH and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Participants signed an informed consent after the study proce-
dures were explained by trained study staff and any questions
were answered. Demographic information including race/ethnic-
ity, smoking history, and education, as well as whether they
had a previous pregnancy, were recorded at study entry by the
participant using a questionnaire. To be included in the present
analysis, women must have contributed their own oocytes and
at least one urine sample for the measurement of flame retard-
ant metabolites during an in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycle.
From the 212 women (298 IVF cycles) who met these criteria,
we excluded 1 woman (1 IVF cycle) with incomplete outcome
data. Our final data set included 211 women with 297 IVF
cycles who had complete information on the exposure and out-
come variables.
Clinical Data and in Vitro Fertilization Outcomes
At study entry, the participant’s date of birth was collected, and
her weight and height were measured by trained study staff. Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated as weight (in kilograms) per
height (in meters) squared. Clinical information was collected or
abstracted from the patient’s electronic medical record by trained
study staff at enrollment into the study and after each IVF cycle.
Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) was measured in a blood
sample drawn on the third day of the menstrual cycle and ana-
lyzed for with an automated electrochemiluminescence immuno-
assay at the MGH Core Laboratory as previously described
(Mok-Lin et al. 2010). Cause of infertility was diagnosed by a
physician at the MGH Fertility Center according to the Society
for Assisted Reproductive Technology (SART) using standard
infertility definitions (SART 2014; Mok-Lin et al. 2010). IVF
treatment protocols were assigned by a physician at the MGH
Fertility Center based on clinical indications and factors such as
age and infertility diagnosis. Treatment protocols include: a)
luteal phase gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist
(low-, regular-, or high-dose leuprolide acetate; Lupron); b) fol-
licular phase GnRH agonist/flare stimulation; or c) GnRH antago-
nist. Lupron dose was reduced at, or shortly after, the start of
ovarian stimulation with FSH/human menopausal gonadotropin
(hMG) in the luteal phase GnRH agonist protocol. Serum peak
estradiol (pmol=L) was measured on the day of ovulation trigger
with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) [estradiol (E2) trigger
levels] using an automated electrochemiluminescence immunoas-
say at the MGH Core Laboratory. Oocytes were counted and
classified by embryologists after egg retrieval as germinal vesi-
cle, metaphase I, metaphase II, or degenerated. Fertilization was
obtained by conventional IVF or intracytoplasmatic sperm injec-
tion (ICSI). Fertilization was confirmed 17–20 h after insemina-
tion by the presence of a fertilized oocyte with two pronuclei.
Embryos were monitored for cell number and morphological
quality [1 (best) to 5 (worst)] on days 2 and 3, and considered
of best quality if they had a score of 1 or 2. Transfer occurred
rarely on day 2, with the majority on day 3 or 5 and com-
prised
of
cleavage
stage and
blastocyst
stage embryos,
respectively.
Most
women
had
1–3
embryos
transferred
(range = 0–5), with the number dependent on the woman’s
age, cycle number. and the day of transfer. Implantation was
defined as a serum b-hCG level >6 mIU=mL approximately 17
d (range = 15–20 d) after egg retrieval, clinical pregnancy as
the presence of an intrauterine pregnancy confirmed by ultra-
sound at approximately 6-wk gestation, and live birth as the
birth of a neonate on or after 24-wk gestation.
Organophosphate Flame Retardant Assessment in
Urine Samples
Urine samples were collected from participants enrolled in the
EARTH study between May 2005 and January 2015. Each sam-
ple was collected into a sterile polypropylene cup, and up to two
urine samples were collected during each IVF cycle. Urine sam-
ples were collected at a geometric mean (GM) [95% confidence
interval (CI)] of 7.6 (7.3, 8.0) d apart with 178 (141, 215) d
between the first and second IVF cycle. Following collection of
each sample, specific gravity (SG) was measured using a
Protometer (hand held)
Model 100B refractometer (National
Instrument Company, Inc.); the urine sample was divided into
aliquots and frozen at −80�C. Samples were shipped on dry ice
overnight to H.M. Stapleton’s lab at Duke University (Durham,
NC) for the quantification of the PFR metabolites (Figure 1).
Extraction and analysis methods for bis(1-chloro-2-propyl) phos-
phate (BCIPP), bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP),
diphenyl phosphate (DPHP), isopropylphenyl phenyl phosphate (ip-
PPP), and tert-butylphenyl phenyl phosphate (tb-PPP) followed meth-
ods previously developed by H.M. Stapleton’s laboratory (Butt et al.
2014). Briefly, urine samples were thawed, and a 2.5- to 5-mL
aliquot was transferred to a clean glass test tube, where it was spiked
with mass-labeled internal standards (d10-BDCIPP = 80 ng, d10-
DPHP = 60 ng). After acidifying to pH <6:5 with formic acid, sam-
ples were diluted 1:1 with water and concentrated and cleaned using
solid-phase extraction techniques (SPE). The SPE eluent was blown
to dryness under a gentle nitrogen stream, reconstituted in 500 lL of
1:1 H2O:MeOH and spiked with the recovery standard (13C2-
DPHP = 81:5 ng). Extracts were analyzed by negative electrospray
ionization liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-
MS/MS) as previously described (Butt et al. 2014). Chromatography
was achieved under gradient conditions using a Luna C18(2) column
(50 × 2:0 mm, 2:5 lm particle size, Phenomenex) preceded by a
SecurityGuard Polar-RP (4 × 2:0 mm) guard cartridge (Phenomenex).
The mobile phases were methanol and water (modified with
0:8 mM ammonium acetate), flow rate was 300 lL=min, the injec-
tion volume was 5 lL, and the column oven was 45°C. Data were
acquired under multiple reaction monitoring conditions using opti-
mized parameters. Analyte responses were normalized to internal
standard responses. BCIPP and BDCIPP were normalized using
d10-BDCIPP, while DPHP, ip-PPP, and tb-PPP were normalized
using d10-DPHP. Urinary SG ranged from 1.002 to 1.028 with a
mean of 1.016.
Samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS in 10 separate batches,
and unique method detection limits (MDLs) were calculated for
each analysis batch. In the urine samples, the mean recovery of the
mass-labeled standards was 119% (standard error = 0:75%) for
d10-DPHP and 152% (2.2%) for d10-BDCIPP. One laboratory
blank (5 mL MilliPore water only) sample was extracted with ev-
ery batch (n = 95). An in-house standard reference material (SRM)
was prepared from pooled urine that was collected during previous
studies. SRM samples were periodically analyzed during the
extraction batches (n = 18) and were generally within 10% for
DPHP, 15% for BDCIPP, and 20% for ip-PPP. Two of the individ-
ual subsamples were analyzed in duplicate to assess method preci-
sion and were generally within 15% for DPHP, 25% for ip-PPP,

 and 35% for BDCIPP. Very low levels of DPHP (mean = 0:58 ng)
and ip-PPP (mean = 0:21 ng) were commonly detected in the labo-
ratory blanks, and analyte values were blank corrected using the
mean laboratory blank values. MDLs were calculated as three
times the standard deviation of laboratory blanks normalized to
the volume of water extracted (5 mL). MDLs ranged (n = 10)
from 68–180 pg=mL for BCIPP, 31–300 pg=mL for BDCIPP,
25–130 pg=mL for DPHP, and 23–120 pg=mL for ip-PPP, and
10–150 pg=mL for tb-PPP, respectively.
Data Analysis
Demographic and clinical characteristics were reported using
mean ± interquartile range or percentages. Unquantified concentra-
tions <MDL were substituted with a value equal to the MDL=p2
(Hornung and Reed 1990). To account for urinary dilution, we
adjusted to SG as described by Pearson et al. (2009): CSG = C�
½ðSGm − 1Þ=ðSGi − 1Þ� where CSG = SG-adjusted urinary metabolite
concentration, C = urinary metabolite concentration, SGm = mean SG
for the population, and SGi = SG for an individual sample.
Cycle-specific urinary metabolite concentrations were calculated
using the GM of the two urinary metabolite concentrations from
each IVF cycle. Cycle-specific concentrations were divided into
quartiles for use in regression models. All analyses used the SG-
adjusted urinary metabolite concentrations.
To evaluate the associations between the urinary metabolites
and IVF outcomes, we fit multivariable generalized linear mixed
models with random intercepts to account for multiple IVF cycles
in the same woman. These models allow for the use of multiple
outcome observations per individual while accounting for within-
person correlations in outcomes. These models are also appropri-
ate and can provide unbiased estimates in the presence of an
unbalanced design (e.g., different number of cycles contributed
per woman) when imbalance in the number of IVF cycles is not
completely random (e.g., women with more cycles are having
more difficulty getting pregnant), and the lack of balance can be
accurately predicted by all measured covariates in the adjusted
model. A normal distribution and identity link function was
specified for peak estradiol and endometrial lining thickness. A
Poisson distribution and log link function were specified for the
number of mature and total oocytes as well as best quality
embryo. A binomial distribution and logit link function were
spcified for fertilization and the proportion of mature to total
oocytes. Finally, a binary distribution with a logit link function

 were specified for the clinical outcomes (implantation, clinical
pregnancy, and live birth). Tests for trend were conducted across
quartiles using the median log-transformed urinary metabolite
concentration in each quartile as a linear variable in the regres-
sion models. To allow for better interpretation of the results, all
results are presented as population marginal means adjusted for
covariates. Percent decrease was calculated as the difference in
marginal means from Q1 to Q4 divided by the marginal mean
from Q1.
We evaluated confounding using prior knowledge and de-
scriptive statistics from our cohort. The following covariates
were considered for inclusion in the final model: maternal age
(continuous), race/ethnic group (black/Asian/other, white/
Caucasian), BMI (continuous), smoking history (ever, never),
education (high school, college graduate, graduate degree),
year of IVF treatment cycle (continuous), and primary infertil-
ity diagnosis (female factor, male factor, and unexplained).
Variables were included in the final model if they were associ-
ated with any of the individual PFR metabolites (BDCIPP,
DPHP, ip-PPP) in our population, were suspected to be associ-
ated with exposure based on previous research, or were strong
predictors of the outcome. In our primary analysis of the early
developmental outcomes, we excluded seven women (16 IVF
cycles) with unsuccessful oocyte retrieval, and applied this
restriction in a sensitivity analysis for the clinical outcomes. We
tested whether the associations of urinary metabolite concentra-
tions with fertilization were modified by ICSI by entering a prod-
uct of the metabolite quartiles and a binary variable representing
the presence or absence of ICSI into the models. Given our lim-
ited sample size for detecting interactions, a suggestion of inter-
action was considered if the p-value for this interaction term was
<0:10. Finally, we tested for a potential cohort effect by control-
ling for maternal year of birth, rather than maternal age, in our
adjusted model.
We evaluated the relationship between urinary PFR metabo-
lites using Spearman’s correlation and estimated the variability
of urinary metabolite concentrations within a cycle and for all
cycles by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).
We conducted all statistical analyses using SAS (version 9.2;
SAS Institute Inc.), and all tests other than interaction with ICSI
considered two-sided significance levels less than 0.05 as statisti-
cally significant.
Results
Study Population
Our analysis included 211 women who were on average 35.0 y of
age; 87% were Caucasian, 75% had never smoked, and 34% had
a prior pregnancy (Table 1). The primary SART diagnosis was
approximately equally distributed between female factor (36%),
male factor (29%), and unexplained (35%).
Urinary Organophosphate Flame Retardant Metabolites
Detection frequencies were high for BDCIPP (87%), DPHP
(94%), and ip-PPP (80%), but low for tb-PPP (14%) and BCIPP
(0%) (Table 2). Concentrations of DPHP were 19% higher than
BDCIPP on average and 252% higher than ip-PPP. Due to the
pmol=L low detection frequencies for tb-PPP and BCIPP, central
tendency values were not calculated and statistical analysis was
not performed for these urinary metabolites. BDCIPP was
weakly but significantly correlated with DPHP (rs = 0:21,
p = 0:002) and ip-PPP (rs = 0:25, p = 0:0003); DPHP and ip-
PPP were also weakly correlated (rs = 0:19, p = 0:006). ICCs
indicated moderate within-person variability across cycles
(BDCIPP = 0:36; DPHP = 0:34; ip-PPP = 0:37), with somewhat
higher reproducibility within a cycle (BDCIPP = 0:48; DPHP =
0:53; ip-PPP = 0:44).
Demographic variables associated with urinary PFR concen-
trations included age (BDCIPP and DPHP), BMI (BDCIPP),
and year (ip-PPP). For every unit increase in age, there was a
4% (p = 0:05) and 3% (p = 0:04) decline in mean urinary
BDCIPP and DPHP concentrations. For every unit increase in
BMI, there was a 4% (p = 0:03) increase in urinary BDCIPP,
and every year, there was a 7% (p = 0:002) decline in urinary
ip-PPP concentrations. There were no other significant associa-
tions with the demographic variables, and no associations of
urinary PFR quartiles with reproductive/cycle characteristics
were observed.
In Vitro Fertilization Outcomes
We observed significant declines in adjusted means from the low-
est to highest quartile of RPFR for the proportion of cycles result-
ing in successful fertilization (10% decrease, p-trend = 0:04),
implantation (31%, p-trend = 0:02), clinical pregnancy (41%,
p-trend = 0:004) and live birth (38%, p-trend = 0:05), adjusted for
age, BMI, race/ethnicity, year of cycle, and infertility diagnosis

 (Figure 2, Tables 3 and 4). There were also significant declines in
adjusted means from the highest to lowest quartile of DPHP for
the proportion of cycles resulting in successful implantation (28%
decrease, p-trend = 0:02) and clinical pregnancy (36%, p-trend =
0:01) as well as for ip-PPP for the proportion of cycles resulting
in successful fertilization (16%, p-trend = 0:0006), implantation
(27%, p-trend = 0:05), and live birth (34%, p-trend = 0:05).
Unadjusted results were similar (Table S1). Results for the clini-
cal outcomes were similar when restricted to IVF cycles with
successful oocyte retrieval, restricted to the first cycle in the

 EARTH study, restricted to nulliparous women, or controlling
for maternal year of birth (Table S2).
The proportion of fertilized oocytes was significantly lower in
the highest quartile (Q4) of urinary ip-PPP compared to the low-
est (Q1) with an adjusted difference in proportions (95% CI) of
0.10 (0.02, 0.19) using conventional fertilization that was
smaller and nonsignificant when restricted to fertilization using
ICSI [adjusted difference in proportions = 0:04 (95% CI =
− 0:02, 0.10)]. However, the interaction term by ICSI on the
association of urinary ip-PPP with fertilization was not statisti-
cally significant (p of interaction = 0:53).
There was a significant positive association between uri-
nary BDCIPP and the number of total oocytes (18% increase,
p-trend = 0:04) and a nonsignificant increase in the number of
mature oocytes (15% increase, p-trend = 0:10) retrieved in an
IVF cycle. For endometrial lining thickness, we observed a
nonsignificant decline in adjusted means from the highest to
lowest quartile of urinary DPHP (4% decrease, p-trend = 0:15).
Similar trends with oocyte count were not observed for DPHP,
ip-PPP, or RPFR (p-trends >0:3). No other associations were
observed between urinary metabolites and the other early de-
velopmental outcomes, and unadjusted results were similar
(Table S3).
Discussion
As far as we are aware, this is the first study to explore associa-
tions in an epidemiologic study on the effects of PFRs on female
reproduction. We used the model of IVF to investigate human
reproduction and early pregnancy outcomes, ranging chronologi-
cally from oocyte retrieval, oocyte fertilization, embryo quality,
and implantation to clinical pregnancy and live birth. The sum of
the urinary PFR metabolites was associated with reduced proba-
bility of successful fertilization, implantation, clinical pregnancy,
and live birth. These findings are clinically relevant, as the
adjusted proportion of live births in the highest quartile of RPFR
was 0.30 as compared to 0.48 in the lowest quartile (adjusted dif-
ference in proportions = 0:18). GM concentrations of the PFR
metabolites in our study population were similar to or lower than
other adult populations in the United States, Norway, and
Australia; thus, these exposure levels are not abnormal or high
(Butt et al. 2014; Carignan et al. 2013b; Cequier et al. 2015;
Cooper et al. 2011; Dodson et al. 2014; Hoffman et al. 2015;
Meeker et al. 2013b; Van den Eede et al. 2015) (Table S4).
Animal studies indicate that PFRs may adversely affect
female reproduction through disruption of regulatory pathways
mediated by the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonadal axis. For exam-
ple, studies in zebrafish have observed decreased fecundity
(hatching and survival) with independent exposures to TDCIPP
and TPHP (Liu et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2015). Evidence of hor-
mone disruption in zebrafish includes increased plasma E2, tes-
tosterone, and vitellogenin as well as increased triiodothyronine
(T3) and decreased thyroxine (T4) (Liu et al. 2013; Wang et al.
2015, 2013). Studies of chicken embryos have observed delayed
hatching as well as declines in plasma thyroxine and cholesterol
(Farhat et al. 2014, 2013). Human studies have also observed an
association between low pregnancy levels of estradiol and fetal
loss (Schindler 2004), and it is well known that subclinical hypo-
thyroidism can adversely affect fertility (Abdel Rahman et al.
2010; Bussen et al. 2000; Scoccia et al. 2012; Velkeniers et al.
2013).
Strengths of our study include the prospective study design,
preconception measurement of exposure using repeated urine
samples (which is necessary for short-lived biomarkers like the
PFR metabolites), state-of-the-art measurement of PFR expo-
sure biomarkers, assessment of early developmental outcomes
(i.e., fertilization, implantation) that are not observable in non-
IVF populations, clinical outcome data obtained from elec-
tronic medical records, and control for potential confounders.
One limitation of this analysis is that we did not consider the
male partner's exposure, which may be correlated with his
female partner and could contribute to the observed associa-
tion. Our findings are generalizable to the infertility clinic pop-
ulation, which is sizable (Thoma et al. 2013), and may be more
broadly generalizable, assuming that women undergoing IVF
have similar biological responses to PFR exposure as women
not undergoing IVF. Our findings may also be more relevant
and generalizable to older women, as the mean age of women
in our study population was 35 y. As each outcome is depend-
ent on the previous, a larger sample would be required to

 differentiate between independent effects on implantation, clin-
ical pregnancy, and live birth.
In conclusion, using IVF as a model to investigate human
reproduction and pregnancy outcomes, we found that concen-
trations of some urinary PFR metabolites were inversely asso-
ciated with proportions of successful fertilization, implantation,
clinical pregnancy, and live birth. These results highlight the
potential reproductive effects of low-level exposure (i.e., back-
ground exposure levels of the general population) to PFRs and
adverse IVF outcomes. Future research should focus on poten-
tial interactions between PFRs and other chemicals (i.e., mix-
tures analysis) that adversely affect reproductive health and
also explore the potential effect of PFRs on male reproductive
health.
