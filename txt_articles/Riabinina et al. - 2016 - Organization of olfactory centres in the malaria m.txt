Mosquitoes are vectors for multiple infectious human diseases and use a variety of sensory
cues (olfactory, temperature, humidity and visual) to locate a human host. A comprehensive
understanding of the circuitry underlying sensory signalling in the mosquito brain is lacking.
Here we used the Q-system of binary gene expression to develop transgenic lines of
Anopheles gambiae in which olfactory receptor neurons expressing the odorant receptor
co-receptor (Orco) gene are labelled with GFP. These neurons project from the antennae and
maxillary palps to the antennal lobe (AL) and from the labella on the proboscis to the
suboesophageal zone (SEZ), suggesting integration of olfactory and gustatory signals occurs
in this brain region. We present detailed anatomical maps of olfactory innervations in the AL
and the SEZ, identifying glomeruli that may respond to human body odours or carbon dioxide.
Our results pave the way for anatomical and functional neurogenetic studies of sensory
processing in mosquitoes.

 A
nopheles gambiae is the major insect vector of Plasmo-
dium falciparum, the parasite that leads to malaria which
is responsible for B450,000 deaths every year1. The
control of these insects is therefore an important human health
issue. Currently, malaria control strategies focus on eliminating
stages of parasite transmission (such as Plasmodium infection of
mosquitoes), or to limit the size of mosquito populations2.
However, relatively few strategies focus on interfering with the
human host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes. Female A. gambiae
mosquitoes are strongly anthropophilic and prefer to bloodfeed
on humans over other animals. They have also been shown to use
olfactory cues to locate humans3,4 and are likely to use olfactory
cues to distinguish humans from other animals5–7. Therefore,
strategies that target the mosquito’s olfactory system might
provide effective means to control host seeking, including the
development of improved trap baits and insect repellants.
However, relatively little is known about the mechanisms of
olfactory processing in A. gambiae.
Knowledge about insect olfactory systems primarily stems from
studies of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster (for example,
see ref. 8). Over the last 25 years, the molecular and cellular basis
of Drosophila olfaction has been well characterized (for example,
see refs 9–12). Numerous studies have elucidated the identity of
Drosophila olfactory receptors and the odours that activate them,
the identity and structure of the sensory neurons that express
these odorant receptors (ORs), how these olfactory receptor
neurons
innervate
the
brain,
all
leading
to
an
in-depth
understanding
of
how
odorant
information
is
received,
integrated and processed by the Drosophila peripheral and
central nervous systems. Studies of Drosophila olfaction are
facilitated by a rich repertoire of genetic tools that are not
currently available in mosquitoes. The development of similar
neurogenetic methods in the mosquito system would greatly
advance investigation of sensory processing in this insect.
In the absence of neurogenetic methods, studies in A. gambiae
have focused on a detailed characterization of the peripheral
olfactory system. Chemosensory tissues in malaria mosquitoes are
covered in specialized sensory hairs called sensilla that typically
contain two to three olfactory receptor neurons13–15. Similar to
the peripheral olfactory system in Drosophila, 3 classes of
chemosensory receptors are found in the A. gambiae genome:
79 ORs12,16,17, 46 ionotropic receptors (IRs)18,19 and 60 gustatory
receptors (GRs)20–23. In situ hybridization and single sensillum
electrophysiological recordings in Drosophila, mosquitoes and
other insects show that neurons expressing ORs and IRs respond
to a variety of volatile odorants including many found in human
body odours11,18,24–26, whereas GRs respond to a number of
stimuli including tastants, pheromones, warmth and the volatile
gas carbon dioxide22,27.
ORs in all insects require an obligatory OR co-receptor (Orco)
for dendritic trafficking of ORs and odorant-induced signal-
ling28,29. Thus, all functional insect OR-expressing neurons also
express the Orco gene. OR-expressing neurons have been detected
by fluorescence in situ hybridization studies of Orco in the
antennae and maxillary palps during the fourth instar larvae
developmental stage of A. gambiae30. In the adult A. gambiae,
Orco- and OR-expressing neurons have been found in three
olfactory organs. Prominent Orco expression was found in the
trichoid sensilla on the 2nd to 13th antennal segments in females,
and on the distal club segments in males17. Orco expression has
also been found in the capitate peg sensilla on the second to
fourth segments of the maxillary palps in females and in the
labella of the proboscis17,22. The maxillary palp capitate pegs in A.
aegypti31 and A. gambiae22 also contain neurons that express a
CO2-sensing GR receptor complex. Orco-expressing neurons
comprise B70% of all olfactory neurons in Drosophila, suggesting
Orco is likely to be expressed in the majority of olfactory neurons
in A. gambiae and thus is an attractive candidate for neurogenetic
targeting in this species.
Binary expression systems, such as GAL4/UAS32,33 and
QF/QUAS (Q-system34,35), are useful and versatile tools for
targeting distinct neuronal subpopulations in Drosophila36. The
GAL4/UAS system has been used previously in A. aegypti37,
A. gambiae38 and Anopheles stephensi39 to target tissues such as
the midgut that are involved in parasite infection in the
mosquito. To enable robust in vivo activity, the activation
domain of GAL4 was replaced with the activation domain of
the Herpes simplex VP16, to achieve satisfactory expression of a
UAS-YFP reporter38 in A. gambiae. A second generation of the
QF transcriptional activator, QF2, drives strong expression of
reporters without compromising cellular functions or the
overall health of transgenic animals35. QF2 is also likely to be
a more potent in vivo transcriptional activator than GAL4
(refs 34,35).
Here we used the Q-system to target Orco-expressing olfactory
neurons in A. gambiae. We characterized a sexually dimorphic
expression pattern of Orco-expressing (Orco þ ) neurons in both
larvae and adult mosquitoes. This transgenic labelling of olfactory
neurons allowed visualization and identification of Orco þ
axonal targets in the brain. Surprisingly, we found that the brain
of A. gambiae contains two regions innervated by Orco þ
olfactory neurons. Antennal and maxillary palp neurons target
the glomeruli of the antennal lobe, but Orco þ olfactory neurons
in the proboscis labella innervate the suboesophageal zone (SEZ)
in the brain, a region likely to be involved in gustatory processing.
We generated the first map of A. gambiae antennal lobe (AL)
glomeruli based on olfactory receptor expression and tissue of
origin. The AL contains approximately equal numbers of
glomeruli innervated by Orco þ and Orco-negative (Orco � )
neurons. We hypothesize that the majority of Orco � glomeruli
in the AL probably receive innervation from antennal olfactory
neurons expressing chemosensory IR genes. We also identified
the Orco � AL glomeruli probably targeted by the GR-expressing
(carbon dioxide-sensing) neurons from the maxillary palp. We
further generated a map of the eight glomerular structures in the
SEZ formed by Orco þ olfactory neurons.
These studies introduce a neurogenetic approach for investi-
gating olfactory processing in the mosquito and suggest that the
SEZ of the brain may directly integrate olfactory and gustatory
cues from the proboscis during bloodfeeding.
Results
Introduction of neurogenetic tools into A. gambiae. The
introduction of the binary Q-system into A. gambiae required the
generation of two different transgenic animal lines: a promoter-
QF2 driver line and a QUAS-geneX effector line. The QF2
transcriptional activator binds and activates the exogenous
transgenic effector gene (QUAS-geneX). Only when the two
components are brought together in the same animal by genetic
crosses is expression of the effector gene induced in the same
pattern as the transcriptional activator. To genetically target
olfactory receptor neurons, we used the presumptive enhancer
and promoter regions of the Orco (AGAP002560, VectorBase
v.AgamP4) gene to generate an Orco-QF2 driver construct.
We PCR amplified a 9,312 bp sequence immediately upstream of
the Orco ATG translation start codon and cloned it 50 to QF2 in a
piggyBac vector containing the synthetic 3xP3 eye promoter
driving
a
DsRed
fluorescent
marker

 actual genomic region needed for Orco expression is located
within a smaller portion of this sequence.
To facilitate the study of neuronal anatomy, we generated a
membrane-targeted green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter
(QUAS-mCD8:GFP), which has been shown to strongly label all
neuronal processes in Drosophila40. This allowed the axonal
targets of the olfactory receptor neurons to be easily identified—a
task not possible using existing anti-Orco antibodies. To generate
the QUAS-mCD8:GFP reporter construct, we cloned 15 copies of
the QUAS sequence34 followed by the Drosophila hsp70 minimal
promoter into a piggyBac vector marked by a 3xP3-ECFP marker.
Immediately downstream of the hsp70 promoter, we cloned a
gene containing the mouse CD8 single-pass membrane protein
fused to GFP (see Supplementary Fig. 1 and Methods for details).
Increasing the number of transcription factor-binding sites in
reporter constructs increases expression levels41 and we reasoned
that using 15x QUAS instead of the standard 5x QUAS34 would
lead to increased expression levels of GFP. This approach may
prove particularly useful in reporting the activity of weak
promoter lines, including olfactory receptor promoters9,10,29.
We generated three Orco-QF2 transgenic lines and two QUAS-
mCD8:GFP transgenic lines. One Orco-QF2 transgenic line drove
expression in only a subset of olfactory neurons, likely to be due
to genomic silencing of gene expression42,43, and was not
characterized further. The other two Orco-QF2 lines produced
highly similar expression
patterns. Both QUAS-mCD8:GFP
transgenic lines drove similarly robust QF2-dependent reporter
expression. For the work presented here, a single Orco-QF2 and a
single QUAS-mCD8:GFP line were used. It should be noted that
we did observe weak, uninduced expression from both QUAS
reporters in a small subset of mushroom body and optic lobe
neurons in adult brains, as well as weak expression in three cells
in the larval maxillary palps (Supplementary Fig. 2). The
nonspecific reporter expression did not interfere with the
analyses of Orco þ olfactory neurons.
Transgenic expression pattern in larvae and adults. We
examined the expression pattern of the Orco-QF2 driver line by
crossing it to the QUAS-mCD8:GFP reporter. Transgenically
driven GFP expression was robust and allowed direct visualiza-
tion
of
GFP-labelled
cell
bodies
and
sensilla
in
larvae
(Supplementary Fig. 3) and in adult mosquitoes without immu-
nostaining (Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Fig. 4). GFP fluores-
cence was evident in the antennae and maxillary palps of third
and fourth instar larvae (Supplementary Fig. 3), and in the
antennae, maxillary palps and proboscis of adult animals (Fig. 1).
Larval antennal (female: median ¼ 10 cells per antenna, inter-
quartile range
(IQR) ¼ 2
cells
per antenna,
n ¼ 20;
male:
median ¼ 11 cells per antenna, IQR ¼ 1.75 cells per antenna,
n ¼ 14) and maxillary palp (both female and male: median ¼ 5
cells per palp, IQR ¼ 1 cell per palp, n ¼ 20) expression was
similar between males and females (Supplementary Figs 3 and 5,
and Supplementary Table 1). Expression patterns in the adult
antennae and maxillary palps (Fig. 1c,d) were sexually dimorphic,
consistent with previous reports17,44. Approximately 500–600
cells were labelled in the female antenna, with GFP þ cells and
trichoid sensilla densely distributed in the 12 distal antennal
segments (Fig. 1a,c). In contrast, B230 GFP þ cells, located
predominantly in the distal 2 segments, were detectable in the
male antenna (Fig. 1b,d). Previous studies report that 95% of
trichoid
sensilla
contain
two
olfactory
neurons13.
When
combined with trichoid sensilla counts (B630 trichoid sensilla
in females andB225 in males)15,45,46, this predicts B1,250
olfactory neurons in female antennae and B550 olfactory
neurons in male antennae. Interestingly, electron microscopy
studies of A. stephensi antennae report five different types of
trichoid sensilla based on physical characteristics15,46. Given the
numbers of Orco þ neurons identified here, this suggests that
many types of trichoid sensilla may not be innervated by Orco þ
neurons, but may be innervated by other classes of olfactory
neurons. It could also be possible that some or all trichoid sensilla
contain one Orco þ and one Orco � olfactory neuron, although
this arrangement is rarely observed in Drosophila.
The maxillary palps in A. gambiae have B67 capitate pegs in
females and B14 pegs in males15. We observed 120 GFP þ cells
in female maxillary palp capitate pegs (Fig. 1c,d) distributed along
segments 2–4 of the palp (Fig. 1a,c) and 40 GFP þ cells in the
male maxillary palp sparsely distributed in the distal club
(Fig. 1b,d). These numbers suggest that approximately two cells
are labelled per capitate peg, in agreement with previous reports22
that two Orco-dependent ORs (OR8 and OR28) are expressed in
the maxillary palps. Expression in the proboscis shows a similar
pattern in males and females, with B45 GFP þ cells located in
the labella of the proboscis (Fig. 1c,d).
There were no GFP-labelled cells besides the antennae and
maxillary palps in third to fourth instar larvae. In adults, we
focused our investigation only on external tissues for Orco-QF2,
QUAS-mCD8GFP expression, which we found was limited to the
expression in the olfactory organs detailed above. It remains to be
determined whether other tissues and cell types, such as sperm47,
are also labelled by Orco-QF2.
Validation of expression. To verify that the Orco-QF2 driver
accurately targets Orco-expressing neurons, we immunostained
peripheral appendages of Orco-QF2, QUAS-CD8:GFP animals
with antibodies directed against DmOrco29 and CD8 (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Fig. 6), comparing immunofluorescence signals in
these
two
channels
with
GFP
fluorescence.
Whole-mount
antibody staining of olfactory tissues can be challenging due to
limited access to neurons within cuticular tissues. Anti-CD8 acted
as a control for the efficiency of antibody labelling of CD8:GFP
protein and antibody staining was often less effective than
labelling observed from native GFP fluorescence. In larval
antennae and maxillary palps (Supplementary Fig. 6) 91–100%
of Orco þ cells were labelled by the anti-CD8 antibody, whereas
94–100% of CD8 þ cells were also labelled by the anti-DmOrco
antibody (Supplementary Table 2). Similarly, in the adult
antennae, maxillary palps and labella, the overlap between anti-
Orco and anti-CD8 staining included 100% of Orco þ cells and
84–97% of CD8 þ cells (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 3). We
also performed sections of adult antennae and immunostained for
anti-DmOrco (Supplementary Fig. 7). We found 100% of anti-
DmOrco þ sensilla were co-labelled by GFP (201 sensilla in 19
samples).
These results indicate that the Orco-QF2 line robustly labels
cells that are detectable with anti-DmOrco and also a small
number of cells not detectable by anti-DmOrco. It is possible that
these extra cells may represent Orco �
olfactory neurons.
Alternatively, as binary expression systems allow for amplification
of weak promoter signals, it is plausible that the QUAS-
mCD8:GFP reporter labels neurons that express low levels of
Orco protein and are not detectable by the anti-DmOrco staining
due to the background of this antibody when used in Anopheles
tissues.
Orco þ neuronal targets in the adult mosquito brain. Using
our neurogenetic approach we find that olfactory receptor
neurons labelled by the Orco-QF2 driver line send their axons to
two distinct areas of the brain: the AL and the SEZ (Fig. 3a). The
AL is larger and has denser Orco þ neuron innervation in

Figure 3 | Orco þ olfactory neurons target two sensory brain regions. (a) Orcoþ receptor neurons send projections to the AL and SEZ of the brain, as
detected in Orco-QF2, QUAS-mCD8:GFP animals by anti-GFP antibody labelling. Left column shows an overall image of the brain (scale bar, 100 mm). Middle
and right columns show the AL and SEZ at higher magnifications (scale bar, 20mm). Confocal sections are maximum z-projections. Arrowhead points to
commissure. Inset shows commissure at higher magnification. (b) Shown are brains of male and female Orco-QF2, QUAS-mCD8:GFP mosquitoes in which the
right antennae had been ablated (as schematized in the cartoon) 5 days before brain dissections. The ALs retain ipsilateral Orcoþ innervation from the
unablated left antennae and bilateral innervation from the intact maxillary palps. Inset shows commissure at higher magnification. Scale bars, 20mm (c–e).
Antennae (c), maxillary palps (d) or proboscis (e) of Orco-QF2, QUAS-mCD8:GFP mosquitoes were cut to B1/3 of their length (as depicted in the cartoons)
and backfilled by neurobiotin that is incorporated into the membranes of severed neurons. The neurobiotin labelling (blue) of the brains, together with the GFP
labelling (green), establishes the origin of Orcoþ receptor neurons (antennal, maxillary palp or proboscis) that innervate the AL and SEZ. Backfills originating
from the antenna innervated only the ipsilateral AL. Backfills originating from the maxillary palps innerved both ipsilateral and contralateral ALs. Backfills
originating from the proboscis innervated only the SEZ brain region. The numbers indicate the distance in micrometres from the most anterior confocal
section. Dashed white lines outline the AL/SEZ. Solid white lines outline the area labelled by the neurobiotin backfill (blue signal). Scale bars, 20mm.

 females than in males (Fig. 3a). To quantify these differences, we
performed three-dimensional (3D) modelling of male and female
A. gambiae brains and antennal lobes (Methods). Female brains
(5.1 � 106±0.3 � 106 mm3, mean±s.e.m., n ¼ 3) were 1.07 times
larger in volume than male brains (4.8 � 106±0.3 � 106 mm3,
mean±s.e.m.,
n ¼ 3).
In
contrast,
female
antennal
lobes
(1.7 � 105±0.1 � 105 mm3, mean±s.e.m., n ¼ 5) were 1.9 times
larger than male antennal lobes (0.9 � 105±0.02 � 105 mm3,
mean±s.e.m.,
n ¼ 3),
reflecting
increases
in
individual
glomerular volumes. The increase in AL size in females is in
agreement with a larger number of Orco þ receptor neurons in
the antennae and maxillary palps innervating AL glomeruli. Some
Orco þ neurons project bilaterally, as evidenced by a clearly
labelled commissure between the left and right ALs (Fig. 3a,b).
Unexpectedly, the SEZ area of the brain is also innervated by
Orco þ neurons in a pattern of six strongly labelled and two
weakly labelled glomerular structures (Fig. 3a). As in Drosophila
the SEZ region is known to receive gustatory inputs from the
proboscis, we hypothesized that Orco þ
neurons from the
mosquito labellum projected to the SEZ.
To determine the origin of the bilaterally projecting Orco þ
neurons, we ablated the right antennae of adult Orco-QF2, QUAS-
mCD8:GFP animals and maintained them for 5 days in standard
conditions, to allow sufficient time for the axons of the severed
olfactory neurons to degenerate, as previously demonstrated in
Drosophila48. The ALs retained Orco þ commissural labelling
and innervation of only two posterior glomeruli in the right
(ipsilateral) AL of the brain, whereas the left AL remained largely
unaffected (Fig. 3b). This suggests that antennal olfactory neurons
project only to the ipsilateral AL, consistent with previous
results49,50 and in contrast to bilateral projection patterns of
Drosophila antennal olfactory neurons48. The two remaining
glomerular targets probably originate from the maxillary palp. To
verify and extend these results, we attempted to label severed
olfactory neurons from the different olfactory tissues with the
anterograde tracing dye neurobiotin51. The neurobiotin backfill
labelling of severed antennal (Fig. 3c) and maxillary palp (Fig. 3d)
neurons indicated that the two bilaterally projecting glomeruli are
indeed innervated by maxillary palp neurons. Thus, all antennal
Orco þ neurons project exclusively to the ipsilateral side of the
brain, whereas maxillary palp Orco þ neurons innervate the
AL bilaterally, consistent with previous backfill studies49,51.
Neurobiotin backfills of antennae and maxillary palps resulted
in staining of all but three posterior glomeruli that were not
reliably labelled in every examined brain (see Fig. 4 for details);
however, the antennal and maxillary palp backfills did not stain
the SEZ. Neurobiotin backfills of the proboscis (Fig. 3e)
confirmed that the SEZ is innervated by Orco þ neurons from
the labella. In contrast to a previous report52, we observed
no neurobiotin þ or GFP þ projections from the proboscis
to the AL.
Olfactory neuron innervation model of the AL. Using our
neurogenetic approach we identified 67–70 glomeruli in the AL of
females and 67–68 glomeruli in the AL of males (Supplementary
Table 4). In contrast to Drosophila, the appearance of the AL in
A. gambiae varies markedly among animals (see Methods), which
could explain the slight variation in the number of glomeruli we
counted. Previous studies51 reported 60 glomeruli in a female and
61 glomeruli in a male AL, and assigned names to the glomeruli
based on their anatomical position. However, previous work
assumed that a large part of the anterior AL was occupied by
projections from Johnston’s organ mechanosensory neurons51.
This contradicts the transgenic Orco4GFP expression we
observe, in which the majority of the anterior glomeruli are
Orco þ . Furthermore, we did not observe GFP expression in the
Johnston’s organ, consistent with a previous study showing a lack
of Orco immunoreactivity in this tissue17. All together, this
suggests that these anterior AL glomeruli do not constitute a
mechanosensory centre. To avoid confusion, we have renamed
the glomeruli, assigning number 1 to the most dorsal and anterior
glomerulus and subsequent numbers to more ventral and
posterior glomeruli (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 5).
We also have made available a 3D reconstruction model of
these data for future studies, to allow renaming of these
glomerular regions based on specific OR identities (see Methods).
Transgenic GFP expression, combined with the neurobiotin
backfill experiments, allowed us to assign each AL glomerulus to
one of four classes based on the origin of their respective receptor
neurons (antennal or maxillary palp) and on the status of
Orco-QF2, QUAS-mCD8:GFP labelling (Fig. 4a). We identified 33
Orco þ glomeruli in both females and males (Supplementary
Table 5), despite the B2.5-fold sexually dimorphic difference in
the number of Orco þ receptor neurons. The majority of the
remaining B50% of glomeruli are likely to be innervated by
olfactory neurons that express either an IR or GR receptor.
Five glomeruli—2 Orco þ (numbered 45 and 55, blue colour
in Fig. 4a) and 3 Orco � (numbered 62, 63 and 64, yellow colour
in Fig. 4a)—were reliably labelled by maxillary palp backfills. The
two Orco þ glomeruli probably correspond to the OR8 and
OR28 receptor neurons22, and at least one of the three Orco �
glomeruli are innervated by neurons expressing the CO2-sensing
GR22-GR23-GR24 receptor complex22.
Varying numbers of glomeruli were labelled by antennal
backfills (purple and green colours in Fig. 4a), with 3 posterior
glomeruli (numbered as 51, 52 and 67, grey colour in Fig. 4a)
exhibiting unreliable labelling. This variability in labelling may be
explained by weak labelling of posterior glomeruli and also by the
fact that neurons originating in the proximal 25–30% of antennae
were not labelled in the backfill experiments and may be
projecting to these unlabelled glomeruli. This ambiguity will be
resolved by future transgenic labelling of neurons that express
single receptor types.
The ability to distinguish the olfactory tissue of origin and the
Orco-expression status for glomerular targets allowed us to
predict a functional map of the AL (Fig. 4b). The organization of
glomeruli within the AL is remarkably similar between Droso-
phila and A. gambiae (Fig. 4b). Orco þ glomeruli are anterior,
whereas Orco � glomeruli (IR and GR glomeruli in Drosophila)
are posterior. This potential evolutionary conservation of AL
anatomy suggests that in A. gambiae, as in Drosophila, most
posterior
Orco �
glomeruli
are
targeted by
IR-expressing
neurons. The ventral location of GR þ glomerular targets in
Drosophila is suspected to have coincided with a developmental
change during which GR þ neurons located in the maxillary
palps switched to the antennae53. Thus, it is likely to be that the
medial–central glomerular location of Orco � , MP þ glomeruli
in Anopheles reflects tissue of origin, as all maxillary palp
olfactory neurons in Drosophila also target medial–central
glomeruli9,10. It remains to be explored whether the similarities
in olfactory neuronal organization between the two species are
also seen in higher brain regions54.
Olfactory innervation model of the SEZ. In the SEZ, we iden-
tified eight glomerular structures formed by Orco þ neurons
originating from the labellum (Fig. 4c). Males and females
exhibited similar SEZ innervation patterns. From these confocal
images, we generated a 3D reconstruction of the Orco þ olfactory
neuron innervation pattern in the SEZ and outlined the glomeruli
in different colours within the olfactory nerve tracts (Fig. 4d).

 mechanosensory neurons52,55,56 (see Methods for availability of
source data). As the labellum is in close proximity to host tissue
during bloodfeeding15, this raises the possibility that it functions
to integrate sensory signals from host odorants and tastants.
Discussion
We report here the first neurogenetic labelling of olfactory
neurons in mosquitoes. By visualizing the entire neuronal
processes of Orco þ olfactory receptor neurons, these studies
revealed that two brain regions are targeted by olfactory receptor
neurons in this species—the AL and the SEZ. This is the first
time, to our knowledge, that insect olfactory receptor neurons
have been found to innervate brain regions outside the AL. These
Orco þ neurons originate in the labella, a structure that is in
close proximity to host skin during bloodfeeding, suggesting that
volatiles of the skin or in the blood may activate these olfactory
receptor neurons in female mosquitoes. Indeed, recordings from
T2 sensilla on the labella indicate activation by low volatility
odorants often found on host tissues or in blood52,57.
The labellum also contains gustatory neurons52,55,56 that in the
Drosophila proboscis are known to innervate the SEZ23. It is
possible that this region in the mosquito SEZ is a sensory
integration centre combining olfactory and gustatory signals. In
humans, the sensory integration of taste and smell gives rise to a
perception of flavor. Whether this region in the mosquito SEZ
underlies a ‘flavor’ centre remains to be explored. Interestingly,
Orco þ olfactory neurons were recently identified at the tip of the
hawkmoth (Manduca sexta) proboscis and found to be involved
in evaluating the quality of flowering plants during pollination58.
Whether the hawkmoth Orco þ proboscis neurons innervate the
SEZ and thus implicate a common sensory integration centre
between Lepidoptera and Diptera remains to be determined.
The
ability
to
label
the
entire
neuronal
process
was
accomplished genetically by introducing the Q-binary expression
system, comprising a QF2 driver line and QUAS-geneX reporter
line, into A. gambiae. Binary expression systems are powerful
genetic tools for investigating and manipulating neuronal circuits,
and adoption of these reagents into the mosquito system should
accelerate studies in neuronal processing of these dangerous
insects. In this work, we used the putative AgamOrco enhancer þ
promoter region to capture the expression pattern of roughly half
of all olfactory neurons in A. gambiae. Similar approaches could
be applied to capture the expression patterns of olfactory neurons
not labelled by Orco, such as the IR neurons and the CO2-sensing
GR neurons. By using the promoters from the ionotropic
co-receptors Ir8 or Ir25, and the promoters from one of the
three GR CO2-sensing complex (Gr22, Gr23 and Gr24), it might
be possible to generate new QF2 lines labelling these olfactory
neuron populations. To this end, we did generate Gr24-QF2
transgenic lines using a 961 bp putative enhancer þ promoter
region, but this did not yield expression. In such cases, alternative
genetic
strategies,
pioneered
in
Drosophila,
can
be
used
for capturing tissue-specific expression patterns to drive QF2
(ref. 59).
There are two major advantages to using a binary expression
system for tissue labelling. The first advantage is amplification of
a promoter signal. If a genomic promoter is weak, meaning
transcription driven by the promoter results in only few copies of
the target gene, it could be difficult to visualize these tissues
directly with conventional fluorescent markers. Yet, when a weak
promoter expresses a transcriptional activator such as QF2, even
low levels of the activator will continue to drive reporter
expression.
In
our
system,
we
used
15
copies
of
the
QF-binding site QUAS, which should lead to robust amplification
of even weak promoters. This is supported by the fact that
membrane-targeted GFP fluorescence in olfactory neurons using
the Orco promoter is visible even in live animals.
The second advantage is versatility. The Orco-QF2 line, which
has been validated here, can be crossed to other QUAS-geneX
effector lines for a range of studies. In our experience, all
QUAS-mCD8:GFP insertions appeared to function in Anopheles,
suggesting that the generation of additional QUAS-geneX lines
will not be a limiting step. We chose first to generate a
membrane-targeted GFP reporter, QUAS-mCD8:GFP, for effi-
cient tissue labelling and anatomical studies. This line will also be
useful when validating the expression patterns of new QF2 driver
lines. Future studies could instead use reporters that monitor
neuronal activity, for example, GCaMP6 (ref. 60). Such reagents
will allow the visualization of olfactory neuron activity in
response to odours in the peripheral organs and also in their
glomerular targets in the brain. These types of studies have been
used to characterize an ‘olfactory code’ in Drosophila24,61,62 and
can be applied to similar studies in Anopheles, to determine the
Orco þ olfactory code that distinguishes the odours of humans
from those of other animals. Besides monitoring neuronal
activity, other QUAS effector lines can be used to manipulate
or
modulate
neuronal
activity.
For
example,
by
using
QUAS-Chrimson63,64 or QUAS-OrX, olfactory neuron activities
could be modulated by red light or odorants, respectively. This
approach has yet to be tested in mosquitoes, but it has the
potential to provide insights into effective strategies that disrupt
olfactory-based host seeking. A rich repertoire of genetic tools
developed in Drosophila can be adopted for similar uses in
mosquitoes36.
We have generated a map of the adult A. gambiae AL. We have
identified glomeruli that are targeted by the antennal or maxillary
palp neurons and glomeruli that are targeted by Orco þ or
Orco � olfactory receptor neurons. This allowed us to predict
which glomeruli may be targeted by IR neurons (Orco � ,
antennal) and which glomeruli may be targeted by the CO2-
sensing neurons (Orco � , maxillary palp). A previous study
speculated that a large portion of the A. gambiae AL comprised
mechanosensory targets from Johnston’s organ in the pedicel51.
However, given that these same glomeruli are clearly innervated
by Orco þ olfactory neurons, this seems unlikely. Instead, the AL
structure is primarily innervated by olfactory neurons from the
antennae and maxillary palps. As in Drosophila65, the mosquito
antennae may contain sensory sensilla that respond to heat and
whose neurons target posterior Orco � AL glomeruli66.
By speculating which glomeruli are targeted by Orco þ
receptor neurons, IR neurons and GR neurons, the Anopheles
AL map presented here also highlights the glomeruli likely to be
activated by different types of odorants. ORs tend to be activated
by host body odorants, such as 4-methylphenol, indole or
1-octen-3-ol11,25, whereas IRs may be activated by acids and
amines found in host body odours, such as lactic acid and
ammonia18. The GR neurons will be activated primarily by
carbon dioxide22,67. The number of glomeruli innervated by
Orco þ receptor neurons and IR neurons is roughly equivalent,
suggesting that host seeking behaviours may rely equally on both
types of olfactory neuron signalling. This is consistent with
studies in A. aegypti in which host seeking was not abolished in
Orco mutant mosquitoes68.
The number of Orco þ glomeruli in the male and female ALs
was the same, despite the sexually dimorphic location and
number of Orco þ neurons in the antennae and maxillary palps.
A notable sexually dimorphic difference was the reduced size of
male glomeruli and ALs: B1.9-fold smaller in volume in males
compared with females. This probably reflects the reduced
number of innervating olfactory neurons in the glomerular
circuit. If each female Orco þ glomerulus can be matched to a

 male Orco þ glomerulus and each glomerulus is innervated by
neurons expressing the same olfactory receptor(s), this suggests
the male olfactory system may represent a scaled-down version of
the female olfactory system. As such, the male has the potential to
respond to all the same odorants that the female responds to, but
due to the reduced number of olfactory neurons, with reduced
acuity. This is in agreement with transcriptome profiling of the
antennae between males and females45. When sensillar numbers
were normalized between the sexes, the identity and expression
levels of ORs between males and females were remarkably
similar45. The transcriptome study identified 59 AgORs enriched
at least twofold in the antennae and maxillary palps (compared
with the body)45. In contrast, we were able to identify only 33
glomeruli innervated by Orco þ neurons. It is possible that
glomeruli in our model might be further subdivided into
additional
glomeruli
based
on
specific
OR
innervations.
Another possibility is that mosquito olfactory neurons may
frequently
express
more
than
one
OR69,70.
In particular,
Anopheles OR genes clustered in the genome (within B450 bp
of each other) are often co-expressed in the same olfactory
neuron
(for
example,
AgOR13,
AgOR16,
AgOR17
and
AgOR55)69,70. Including all Ag OR gene clusters (VectorBase,
AgamP4), as many as 17 Ag OR genes might be co-expressed in as
few as 6 olfactory neuron types. Furthermore, if receptor
combinations are sexually dimorphic for each neuron, this
could be a mechanism to enable differential response profiles
between males and females, while maintaining overall expression
of the same set of ORs.
The maxillary palp is a simplified olfactory organ, containing
only capitate peg sensilla that house olfactory neurons. Prior
electrophysiological studies identified three neurons within each
capitate peg sensillum, with two of these neurons expressing Orco
and the third expressing the Gr22–Gr23–Gr24 receptor complex
and being CO2 sensitive22. By ablating one antenna and allowing
for the Orco þ olfactory neurons in the antenna to degenerate,
we visualized the two glomerular targets for the two Orco þ
olfactory neurons originating from the maxillary palp capitate peg
sensilla. By using neurobiotin backfills of severed maxillary palp
nerves, we identified five posterior glomeruli in the AL that were
innervated from the maxillary palp, including the two glomeruli
innervated by the Orco þ olfactory neurons. These data suggest
that Orco � neurons from the maxillary palp innervate three
glomeruli. The capitate peg Gr22–Gr23–Gr24 CO2-sensing
neuron must innervate at least one of these three glomeruli.
The other two glomeruli will either be innervated by the
CO2-sensing olfactory neurons or currently unidentified non-
chemosensory neurons. Besides the capitate pegs, the maxillary
palp contains two other innervated sensilla—the campaniform
sensilla
and
sensilla
chaetica
that
probably
function
as
mechanoreceptors,
proprioreceptors
or
touch
sensors14,15.
Alternatively,
some
of
these
Orco �
glomeruli
may
be
innervated by neurons in uncharacterized sensilla that respond
to non-mechanical stimuli such as humidity or temperature, as
found in the Drosophila AL71.
We also generated the first map of the Orco þ olfactory
receptor neuron targets in the A. gambiae SEZ. These may
represent a previously unreported mode of olfactory signalling
independent of the AL in an insect brain. In Drosophila, gustatory
neuron targeting in the SEZ is diffuse23. Interestingly, the Orco þ
olfactory neurons in A. gambiae appear to form eight glomerular
structures in the SEZ region. A number of questions regarding
this innervation remain to be explored. Are these olfactory
neuron targets also innervated by gustatory neurons? Do all
labellar Orco þ olfactory neurons innervate all SEZ glomeruli or
do subsets exist based on OR expression? Are these olfactory
glomeruli organized to influence gustatory signals such that
favourable host odours trigger pleasant tastes and unfavourable
host odours trigger bitter-like tastes?
As vectors for viral and parasitic diseases, anthropophilic
insects pose a major threat to human health. Mosquitoes are
particularly dangerous due to their ability to visit multiple people
during a bloodmeal, such that infections can rapidly spread
through both human and mosquito populations. Effectively
controlling the spread of mosquito-borne diseases will probably
require a multitude of approaches. Given that each step in host
seeking—from long-range guidance to short-range biting—
involves cues from the olfactory system, targeting this sense
could provide an effective means of reducing biting and the
spread of disease. The neurogenetic tools introduced here may
help identify which aspect of olfactory host-seeking, such as
labellar probing or long-range guidance, is the most vulnerable to
interference, and thereby guide new strategies for olfactory-based
interventions.
Methods
Recombinant DNA construction. Plasmids were constructed by enzyme
digestions, PCR, subcloning and the In-Fusion HD Cloning System (Clontech,
catalogue number 639645). Plasmid inserts were verified by DNA sequencing.
The pXL-BACII-ECFP-15xQUAS_TATA-mCD8-GFP-SV40 construct was
used to generate transgenic animals, carrying a reporter transgene QUAS-
mCD8-GFP. The 15xQUAS sequence was PCR amplified from pQUASp plasmid
(Addgene #46162) using oligos pBac-ECFP-15xQUAS-Inf-FOR (50-aga gcg gcc gcc

into pXL-BacII-ECFP plasmid72, digested with XhoI and SacII. Next, the TATA-
mCD8-GFP-SV40-SV40 sequence was PCR amplified from pQUASt-mCD8-GFP
plasmid34; Addgene #24351) using oligos pBac-ECFP-GFP-Inf-FOR (50-act cag tga

cga gag atc tag gcc ttc tag tgg atc cg-30), and InFusion-cloned into the inter-
mediate step construct, obtained at the previous step, that was digested with PpuMI
and XhoI.
The pXL-BacII-15xQUAS_TATA-SV40 construct may be used to easily
generate new QUAS reporter plasmids by sub-cloning a reporter gene into the
multi-cloning site between TATA promoter and SV40 terminator sequences.
To create pXL-BacII-15xQUAS_TATA-SV40, pXL-BACII-ECFP-15xQUAS_TATA-
mCD8-GFP-SV40 was digested with XhoI and EcoRV-HF to remove the CD8-
GFP-SV40-SV40 cassette. The SV40 terminator was PCR amplified from pQUASt-
mCD8-GFP (ref. 34; Addgene #24351) with oligos pBac-15xQUAS-SV40-Inf-FOR
(50-gcg gcc gcg gct cga gac gtc gat ctt tgt gaa gga acc tta ctt ctg-30) and pBac-
15xQUAS-SV40-Inf-REV (50-ttt ctt gtt ata gat atc gat cca gac atg ata aga tac att

The pXL-BACII-DsRed-QF2-hsp70 construct may be used to easily generate
new QF2 (ref. 44) driver plasmids by sub-cloning an enhancer/promoter sequence
upstream of QF2. To create pXL-BACII-DsRed-QF2-hsp70, the QF2-hsp70 cassette
was PCR amplified from pattB-syn-QF2-hsp70 (ref. 35; Addgene #46115) with
oligos pBAC-DSred-QF2-Inf-FOR (50-atc aat gta tct cga ggc cgg cca aca tgc cac cca

EcoRV-HF.
The pXL-BACII-DsRed-OR7_9kbProm-QF2-hsp70 construct was used to
generate transgenic animals, carrying an Orco-QF2 driver construct. A 9,312 bp
sequence immediately upstream of AGAP002560 (OR7) gene was PCR amplified
with oligos Agamb-OR7-Inf-FOR9_1 (50-atc aat gta tct cga gtg atg caa att gtt cgg aag

(Qiagen, #69506) from the Keele strain of A. gambiae. The PCR product was
InFusion cloned into the pXL-BACII-DsRed-QF2-hsp70 vector, digested with XhoI
and FseI.
A. gambiae transgenics. The A.gambiae M-form strain Ngousso (the M-form of
A. gambiae is now referred to as Anopheles coluzzii) were grown at 28 �C, 70–75%
relative humidity, 12 h light/dark cycle. Freshly deposited eggs were collected by
providing mated, gravid females with wet filter paper as an oviposition substrate for
15–20 min, after which the eggs were collected and systematically arranged side-
by-side on a double-sided tape fixed to a coverslip. Aligned embryos were covered
with halocarbon oil (Sigma, series 27) and injected at their posterior pole with an
injection cocktail between 30–40 min after egg laying. Injection cocktails consisted
of a mixture of two plasmids, one with a piggyBac vector carrying the transgene of
interest with a dominant visible marker gene, DsRed or enhanced cyan fluorescent
protein (ECFP), under the regulatory control of the 3xP3 promoter, and a piggyBac
transposase-expressing plasmid consisting of the transposase open reading frame
under the regulatory control of the promoter from the A. stephensi vasa gene.

 Vector concentrations were at either 35, 75 or 150 ng ml � 1, whereas the transpo-
sase-expressing plasmid was at 300 ng ml � 1 in 5 mM KCl, 0.1 mM sodium
phosphate pH 6.8. Halocarbon oil was immediately removed and coverslips with
injected embryos were placed in trays of water at 28 �C, where the first instar larvae
hatched B 24 h later. The Insect Transformation Facility (https://www.ib-
br.umd.edu/facilities/itf) within the University of Maryland College Park’s Institute
for Bioscience and Biotechnology Institute performed all embryo microinjections.
Adults developing from injected embryos were separated by sex before mating and
small groups of five to ten injected adult males and females were mixed with wild-
type Ngousso adults of the opposite sex. The progeny from these matings were
screened during the third or fourth larval instar for the presence of vector-specific
marker gene expression. Transgenic larvae were saved and as adults were
backcrossed to Ngousso (wild type).
Using the strategy of promoter cloning as described for Orco, we also generated
promoter-QF2 transgenic Anopheles using predicted promoter sequences for GR24
(AGAP001915; 957 bp), elav (AGAP001883; 6,569 bp) and n-syb (AGAP005507;
10,194 bp). These QF2 transgenic lines did not show expression when crossed to
QUAS-mCD8:GFP, suggesting the promoter fragments used were insufficient for
capturing the expected expression pattern.
A. gambiae stock maintenance. A. gambiae were grown at 28 �C, 70–75% relative
humidity and 12 h light/dark cycle. Larvae were provided with TetraMin Tropical
Flakes and/or Purina Cat Chow Indoor pellets ad libitum, whereas adults were
provided with 10% sucrose continuously. Mated, adult females were fed human
blood using temperature-controlled membrane-feeding devices or mouse blood
from anaesthetized mice and eggs were collected from the resulting gravid females
by providing them with a cup of water containing wet filter paper on which to
deposit their eggs. Orco-QF2 and QUAS-CD8:GFP transgenes were brought
together by a genetic cross and maintained in the same stock for at least seven
generations with no observable reduction in the strength or breadth of GFP
expression.
Immunohistochemistry. Dissection of adult brains and immunostaining were
done as described previously74. In short, on day 1 heads of adult mosquitoes were
fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (Millonig’s pH
7.4) with 0.25% Triton X-100 at 4 �C for 3 h. Next, the brains were dissected in PBS
containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (PBT), washed in PBT for 1 h at room temperature
(RT) and permeabilized with 4% Triton X-100 þ 2% normal goat serum (NGS) in
PBS at 4 �C overnight. On day 2, the brains were washed in PBT for at least 1 h and
placed in primary antibody mix þ 2% NGS in PBT for two nights at 4 �C. On day 4,
the brains were washed for several hours in PBT at RT and placed in secondary
antibody mix þ 2% NGS in PBT for two nights at 4 �C. On day 6, the brains were
washed in PBT and placed in mounting solution (Slow Fade Gold) overnight at
4 �C, and mounted on a microscope slide on day 7. To visualize CD8:GFP
expression, we used rat anti-CD8 (Invitrogen #MCD0800, 1:100) and mouse
nc82 (DSHB, 1:50) primary antibodies, and Alexa-488 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen
#A11034, 1:200) and Cy3 goat anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch #115-165-
062, 1:200) secondary antibodies.
Anterograde tracing experiments with neurobiotin were performed essentially
as described in ref. 51. Live mosquitoes were cooled in a 4 �C fridge for 10–15 min,
after which they were transferred to a petri dish and placed on ice for up to 30 min
until they were mounted in the backfill chamber. The backfill chamber consisted of
a 9 cm petri dish with two parallel strips of Blue-Tack (Bostik, France) on the
bottom of the dish, 2 cm apart. Double-sided sticky tape was placed on top of one
of the Blue-Tack strips. The other strip was used to hold glass pipettes, which were
pulled out of glass capillaries (Harvard Apparatus, #30–0108), and had the tips
broken off to create an opening of B0.3 mm. The pipettes were backfilled with 2%
Neurobiotin (Vector Laboratories, # SP-1155 or #SP-1150) in 0.25 M KCl.
Mosquitoes were mounted on the double-sided tape and either one antenna, one
maxillary palp or the proboscis was cut to B25% of the original length and
inserted into the tip of the biotin-filled glass pipette. We used a separate pipette for
each animal. Small pieces of damp Kimwipes were placed into the backfill chamber,
to prevent desiccation of the animals. The chambers were wrapped in aluminum
foil and placed at 4 �C for 20–24 h, after which we followed the Brain
immunostaining protocol, described above. When Neurobiotin-Plus (Vector
Laboratories, # SP-1150) was used for backfills, Avidin-Texas Red Conjugate
(Molecular Probes, #A-820, 1:6,000) was added to the primary antibody mix and
647 goat anti-mouse (Life Technologies #Z25008, 1:200) secondary antibody was
used instead of Cy3 goat anti-mouse. When Neurobiotin-350 (Vector Laboratories,
# SP-1155) was used for backfills, no modifications were required for the Brain
immunostaining protocol. Brains were kept in the dark at all times.
Whole-mount preparation of adult antennae, maxillary palps and proboscis was
performed as described in ref. 70 with minor modifications. On day 1, mosquitoes
were immobilized on ice, their heads were cut off and placed in ZnFA fixative
solution (0.25% ZnCl2, 1% formaldehyde, 135 mM NaCl, 1.2% sucrose and 0.03%
Triton X-100) in 250 ml PCR tubes for 20–24 h at RT in the dark. On day 2, the
heads were washed twice for 15 min each with HBS buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM
KCl, 25 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, 5 mM CaCl2 and 0.03% Triton X-100).
Appendages were carefully cut off in HBS and placed in separate PCR tubes, based
on gender and type of tissue (six PCR tubes in total for antennae, maxillary palps
and proboscises of male and female mosquitoes). After a brief wash in HBS, the
tissue was incubated in 80% methanol/20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solution
for 1 h at RT, washed for 5 min in 0.1 M Tris pH 7.4, 0.03% Triton X-100 solution
and incubated in blocking solution (PBS, 5% NGS, 1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton
X-100) for at least 3 h at RT. Next, the tissue was put in blocking solution
containing the primary antibodies, the PCR tubes were placed in a buoyant
perforated plastic pipette tip holder and allowed to float in a water bath sonicator
(Bansonic 1,200, Branson, Danbury, CT) for 5 min (antennae and maxillary palps),
or held with forceps and dipped into the water bath sonicator for 30–60 s
(proboscises). Next, the PCR tubes were placed for 4 days at 4 �C in the dark.
Sonification was repeated on day 3. On day 6, the tissue was washed at RT in PBS,
1% DMSO and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2–3 h. Secondary antibodies were added to
blocking solution, the tubes were sonicated as described above and incubated for 3
days at 4 �C in the dark. On day 9, the tissue was washed at RT in PBS, 1% DMSO
and 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2–3 h, rinsed in PBS and mounted in Slow Fade Gold.
To visualize CD8:GFP expression, we used a rat anti-CD8 primary antibody
(Invitrogen #MCD0800, 1:100). To visualize Orco protein, we used a rabbit anti-
DmOrco antibody29 (gift from Leslie Vosshall, Rockefeller University, 1:100).
The secondary antibodies were Cy3 goat anti-rabbit (Jackson Immuno Research
#111-165-144, 1:200) and 633 goat anti-rat (Invitrogen #A21094, 1:200). We
did not use any green secondary antibody, to clearly visualize endogenous GFP
fluorescence, driven by the transgenic reporter.
Whole-mount preparation of larval antennae and maxillary palps was
performed similar to the adults. On day 1, third and fourth instar larvae were
separated by sex (females with red markings on their cuticle, males with pale
cuticles; larvae with ambiguous markings were excluded). The larval heads were
cut off and placed in ZnFA fixative solution in two separate 250 ml PCR tubes
(one for males and one for females) for 20–24 h at RT in the dark. The following
steps were performed identically to the adult antennae and maxillary palps, with
one exception: larval appendages remained attached to the heads throughout the
staining protocol and were only dissected off immediately before mounting.
Cryosections of adult antennae were performed as described in ref. 17. On day
1, heads with attached antennae of female mosquitoes were dissected and pre-fixed
in 4% paraformaldehyde in.03% PBT at 4 �C for 30 min, then rinsed three times
with PBT and placed in a 25% sucrose solution in PBT overnight at 4 �C. On day 2,
samples were submerged in Tissue-Tek OCT compound (Sakura Finetek,
Torrance, CA) and frozen at � 80 �C before being sectioned at 12 mm on a Microm
HM 500 M cryostat (Microm International GmbH, Walldorf, Germany). Sections
were collected on SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher Scientific) and dried for 30 min at
RT, then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in.03% PBT at RT for 30 min. Slides were
rinsed three times with PBT at RT, blocked in PBT þ 5% NGS for 1 h at RT
and incubated with primary antibody in blocking solution overnight at 4 �C
(rabbit anti-DmOrco29, gift from Leslie Vosshall, Rockefeller University, 1:100).
On day 3, slides were rinsed three times at RT with PBT, then incubated with
secondary antibody in block for 2 h at RT (Cy3 goat anti-rabbit, Jackson Immuno
Research #111-165-144, 1:200). No green secondary antibody was used, to visualize
endogenous GFP fluorescence. Slides were rinsed three times with PBT at RT, then
mounted in Slow Fade Gold.
Whole-animal imaging. Adult mosquitoes were anaesthetized at 4 �C, placed on
the ECHO therm chilling/heating plate (Torrey Pines Scientific) set to 0 �C and
imaged by a Zeiss SteREO Discovery.V8 microscope equipped with a GFP-470 and
ds-Red filters and a Jenoptik ProgRes MF cool charge-coupled device camera.
Images were acquired in ProgRes Mac Capture Pro 2.7 software and stored in *.tif
format. Images that are compared with each other were obtained under identical
hardware and software settings.
Petri dishes filled with water containing larval mosquitoes were placed on the
ECHO therm chilling/heating plate set to 0 �C and imaged as described for the
adults.
Confocal imaging and analyses. Brains, head appendages and cryosections were
imaged on a LSM 700 Zeiss confocal microscope at 512 � 512 pixel resolution, with
0.96 mm or 2.37 mm Z-steps. For illustration purposes, confocal images were pro-
cessed in ImageJ to collapse Z-stacks into a single image; in some cases, the colour
channels were swapped or duplicated.
No other image processing was performed on the confocal data.
To quantify Orco and mCD8-GFP co-expression in the adult (Supplementary
Table 3), we used the 3D reconstruction software Amira (FEI, Oregon, USA) to
manually outline cells stained with anti-Orco or anti-CD8 antibodies. Each
outlined cell was assigned a separate label. Cells were marked independently in
Orco (red) and in CD8 (blue) channels, creating two layers of labels in Amira.
Next, 3D surfaces, corresponding to the outlined cells, were generated by the
software and manually inspected as to the overlap of Orco and CD8 channels.
To quantify Orco (red) and mCD8-GFP (blue) co-staining with GFP
fluorescence (green) in the larvae (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), we used ImageJ
with the Image5D plugin and Zen Zeiss software to mark and count cells in each of
the three fluorescence channels.
To quantify the overlap of Orco staining (red) and endogenous GFP
fluorescence (green) in the cryosectioned female antennae, we used ImageJ with the

 Image5D plugin and Zen Zeiss software to mark and count cells and sensilla in
each channel.
The 3D reconstructions of the AL and SEZ were generated in Amira as
described above. For the AL, glomeruli were manually identified and labelled in the
nc82 channel, and coloured based on whether they were also labelled in the Orco
channel, the backfill channel or neither of these two. The correspondence between
the data, presented in this study and in ref. 51 (Supplementary Table 5), was
established by visual inspection of images in ref. 51 and finding a glomerulus in our
data that appeared to have the closest anatomical location to each reported
glomerulus. For the SEZ, glomerular-like structures were identified and labelled in
the GFP channel, and volume rendering of the same channel was used to show
processes. The 3D models are available (see below).
ALs showed high variability in appearance between individuals, in contrast to
what we have observed in Drosophila75. Experimental conditions (for example, age,
feeding and growth) were maintained as much as possible. Nonetheless, differences
between AL samples probably arose due to a combination of technical (dissections
and mounting) and biological reasons (for example, a rigid oesophagus pressing
against ALs deforming glomeruli to different degrees). Future transgenic labelling
of individual olfactory neuron classes will help address the source of glomerular
variability.
Adult brain volumes were calculated as follows: we manually traced each
confocal plane of nc82-stained male and female central brains in Amira (excluding
optic lobes) and used the Amira software to generate 3D surfaces from the traces.
These were used to calculate the enclosed surface volume of the central brain.
AL volumes were calculated by summing 3D reconstructions of each glomerulus
for each AL.
