The honey bee is a major pollinator whose health is of global concern. Declines
in bee health are related to multiple factors, including resource quality and
pesticide contamination. Intensive agricultural areas with crop monocultures
potentially reduce the quality and quantity of available nutrients and expose
bee foragers to pesticides. However, there is, to date, no evidence for syner-
gistic effects between pesticides and nutritional stress in animals. The
neonicotinoids clothianidin (CLO) and thiamethoxam (TMX) are common
systemic pesticides that are used worldwide and found in nectar and
pollen. We therefore tested if nutritional stress (limited access to nectar and
access to nectar with low-sugar concentrations) and sublethal, field-realistic
acute exposures to two neonicotinoids (CLO and TMX at 1/5 and 1/25 of
LD50) could alter bee survival, food consumption and haemolymph sugar
levels. Bee survival was synergistically reduced by the combination of poor
nutrition and pesticide exposure (250%). Nutritional and pesticide stressors
reduced also food consumption (248%) and haemolymph levels of glucose
(260%) and trehalose (227%). Our results provide the first demonstration
that field-realistic nutritional stress and pesticide exposure can synergistically
interact and cause significant harm to animal survival. These findings have
implications for current pesticide risk assessment and pollinator protection.
1. Introduction
Pollinators provide essential ecosystem services, contributing to wild plant bio-
diversity [1] and sustaining agricultural productivity [2]. The honey bee is a
major pollinator species, and its poor health is related to multiple factors
[3,4], including resource quality [5] and pesticide contamination [6]. Concern
is therefore growing about honey bee nutrition and the potential for synergistic
effects between pesticide exposure and nutrition [7,8].
Intensive agriculture with crop monocultures modifies natural land use,
reduces natural habitats and plant diversity [9], and decreases the quality
and quantity of nutrients in nectar and pollen [7,10]. Honey bees pollinate mul-
tiple crops and can therefore be vulnerable to such reduced food quality.
Nutritional stress plays a crucial role in bee losses and poor colony health
[7,11]. In fact, nutritional deficits were identified as a major cause of colony
losses in the USA between 2007 and 2015 (21–58%) [12].
Agriculture also exposes foragers to pesticides [13]. Attention has focused
on the neonicotinoid pesticides [14] because of their adverse impacts on polli-
nator health [15]. Neonicotinoids are globally used systemic insecticides [16]
that can be found in the nectar and pollen collected by foragers [17], and are

 highly toxic to bees [16]. Bees can be exposed to pesticides
that drift from treated fields when they forage on flower-
ing strips, buffer zones, and cover or catch crops [18].
Furthermore, neonicotinoids are highly persistent and are
found in environmental reservoirs such as water and soil
[17]. Consequently, plants could take up neonicotinoids
years after the actual treatment, resulting in prolonged
contamination [13,17].
Clothianidin (CLO) and thiamethoxam (TMX) are com-
monly used neonicotinoids, and CLO is also a degradation
product of TMX [16]. These neurotoxic insecticides are
agonists of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) [16]
and impair bees in multiple ways [15,19]. Neonicotinoids
have additive and synergistic effects on honey bees in combi-
nation with health stressors such as nosemosis and Varroa
infestation (for review, see [20]). Moreover, the combination
of poor nutrition and pesticide exposure may be especially
problematic given that some genes can be upregulated by
pesticide or pollen stress [21]. To date, there is no evidence
for negative synergistic effects between pesticides and nutri-
tional stressors in any animal studies [22]. However, good
nutrition can help: bees were typically more resistant to
pesticides when fed pollen diets [21,23]. Food quality can
influence the effect of toxins on the health of other arthro-
pods, such as Daphnia [24–26] and Diaptornus [27]. A few
studies have demonstrated synergies between starvation
and contamination from heavy metals, PAHs or PCBs on
aquatic
animals
(fish,
amphipods
and
molluscs)
(for
review, see [22]). However, these are not pesticides. We
therefore decided to study the interactive effects of field-
realistic neonicotinoids and nutritional stress on a major
pollinator species.
We focused on honey bees because they are an important
pollinator and are an indicator of how insect pollinators can
respond to environmental stressors [28]. Bee foragers are par-
ticularly
important
because
they
are
the
only
colony
members that spend a significant proportion of their time
flying [29] and therefore have significant energy needs.
Unlike other insects, in which flight is initially powered by
glycogen and subsequently by lipids, honey bee flight is
entirely powered by sugars in the honey stomach after the
depletion of glycogen reserves [30]. Sugar is therefore essen-
tial for foraging because flight has high-energetic demands
[31,32]: forager metabolic activity increases 50–100 times
during flight [31]. A bee could need up to 12 mg of sugar
to sustain itself for each 1 h of flight [33]. To deal with such
high energy demands, sugars are quickly absorbed into the
bee’s haemolymph [34].
Honey bees store only small amounts of glycogen in
their flight muscles [35] and thus have high haemolymph
sugar levels relative to other insects [36]. Haemolymph
sugar content is therefore a good indicator of bee nutritional
and physiological status. Trehalose, a disaccharide composed
of two D-glucose molecules, is the most abundant sugar in
honey bee haemolymph [36,37] and can be rapidly metab-
olized into
D-glucose to release energy [37].
D-glucose is
another major component of bee haemolymph [38] and is
used to power motor activities directly [39].
We therefore tested the combined effects of sublethal,
field-realistic acute exposures (see Material and methods) to
two neonicotinoids (CLO and TMX at 1/5 and 1/25 of
their LD50) and nutritional stress (limited sugar quantity
and quality) on forager survival, food consumption and
haemolymph sugar levels. Haemolymph sugar levels were
assessed 2 h after treatment to test for potential rapid altera-
tions caused by pesticide administration. Survival and sugar
consumption were assessed over a longer period (4 days). We
studied foragers because they spend a majority of their time
foraging, an energy-intensive task [31] that can also expose
bees to neonicotinoid-contaminated nectar.
2. Material and methods
This study was conducted in the summer of 2015 in Bologna,
Italy. We used five queen-right honey bee (Apis mellifera ligustica)
colonies located in the experimental apiary of the Council for
Agricultural Research and Economics, Agriculture and Environ-
ment Research Centre (CREA-AA). The colonies were healthy,
produced honey and showed no sign of disease throughout the
season. They were managed according to an organic production
protocol [40], and we used standard inspection techniques [41] to
confirm that our colonies did not have detectable disease or para-
site infestations. Colonies were inspected at least once per week.
We exposed bees to a nutritional stress (limited access to
nectar or ad libitum access to nectar with low-sugar concen-
trations) and a neonicotinoid treatment. These treatments were
administered individually and in combination to test for syner-
gistic interactions [42]. After exposure, we measured the effects
of the nutritional and neonicotinoid stressors on survival (up
to 4 days after treatment), food consumption (up to 4 days
after treatment), and glucose and trehalose haemolymph levels
(2 h after treatment). We repeated the experiment four times
(twice for each pesticide), using a total of 2840 foragers from
five different colonies. We report mean +1 s.e., and superscript
‘DS’ indicates the statistical tests that passed the Dunn–Sidak
correction for multiple pairwise comparisons. Further details
are reported in the electronic supplementary material.
(a) Sugar diet treatments
We define nutritional stress as limited access to nectar or access
to nectar with low-sugar concentrations. We tested sugar diets
with different quantities (amounts) and qualities (concentrations)
of sucrose. We provided the bees either ad libitum or limited
(10 ml) quantities of sugar solution. The quality of the sugar
diet was either rich (50% (w/w) sucrose solution), intermediate
(32.5%) or poor (15%).
Our nutritional stresses are field-realistic. Foragers can be
exposed to the sugar concentrations that we tested when foraging
for nectar or consuming non-ripened honey stored in the nest.
Bees collect nectar containing 5–80% (w/v) sugar concentration
[43,44], but sugar concentrations can be as low as 2% [43]. Nectar
is converted into honey in the hive via ripening, a process that
increases sugar concentrations [44]. However, this process
starts in the hive only [44]. Counterintuitively, foragers even
dilute the sugar concentration in nectar by approximately 1%
during nectar collection [45]. Thus, foragers can consume
nectar containing less than 5% sugar while foraging and flying
outside the nest.
Inside the nest, nectar is ripened gradually over a period
taking up to 5 [45] or even 21 days [44]. When nectar is rapidly
collected in large quantities, bees do not immediately ripen it;
instead they deposit the nectar, largely unconcentrated, into sto-
rage cells [45]. Ripening is therefore influenced by multiple
factors: weather, honey flow conditions, collection rates, colony
strength, amount and concentration of nectar, extent of available
storage cells, temperature, humidity and ventilation conditions
[45]. Bees can thus be exposed to largely unconcentrated nectar
for several days when consuming carbohydrates stored in
the hive.

 Individual carbohydrate intake can also be limited by non-
foraging periods. In fact, lack of sufficient food stores is a
common cause of winter colony losses [11] (i.e. involved in
58% of the colonies lost in the USA in 2014–2015 [12]). In our
study, we therefore tested this limited carbohydrate scenario in
two ways: feeding bees with a limited amount of sucrose
solution or, in a separate treatment, feeding bees no nutrients
(0% sucrose).
(b) Neonicotinoid treatments
We followed the most recent international guidelines for pesti-
cide tests on bees [46]. We tested sublethal acute oral exposure
to field-realistic doses of two neonicotinoid pesticides: CLO
and TMX. Our doses were field-realistic because bees can con-
sume
higher
doses
of
CLO
and
TMX
while
collecting
contaminated nectar in the field for a short period (1 h) (see
details below). Treatments consisted of a control dose (pesti-
cide-free) or a neonicotinoid dose (dose) that was either 1/25
(lower dose, TMX ¼ 0.2 ng/bee, CLO ¼ 0.16 ng/bee) or 1/5
(higher dose, TMX ¼ 1 ng/bee, CLO ¼ 0.8 ng/bee) of their
respective LD50 (TMX ¼ 5 ng/bee, CLO ¼ 4 ng/bee) [47,48].
The no nutrients diet was pesticide-free. The higher doses
used for each neonicotinoid reflect field-realistic scenarios with
elevated neonicotinoid contamination. Calculations based on
European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) [49] data confirm that
our sublethal doses were lower than the worst-case scenario in
which bees foraged for 1 h on nectar that was contaminated
with CLO or TMX after a seed treatment (maximum field-
realistic doses: CLO ¼ 1 ng/bee/1 h, TMX ¼ 0.66 ng/bee/1 h)
or a transplant-drip application (maximum field-realistic dose
of TMX ¼ 1.80 ng/bee/1 h).
For CLO, the EFSA [49] calculated that foragers can consume
up to 1 ng/bee in 1 h of nectar foraging. This calculation was
based on the field-realistic concentration of CLO in nectar
(9 ppb, found in oilseed rape nectar after seed treatment appli-
cation [49]) and sugar in oilseed rape nectar (10% (w/w)
[44,50]). A previous study similarly estimated that a forager
can acutely consume up to 1.36 ng of CLO in a foraging trip
when collecting nectar on oilseed rape fields grown from seeds
treated with CLO [42]. In fact, CLO can occur at even higher
field-realistic concentrations in nectar (e.g. 10 ppb [17,51]) and
pollen (e.g. 41 ppb [52]) than those used in our study.
Similarly, for TMX, EFSA [49] calculated that foragers can
consume up to 0.66 ng/bee in 1 h of foraging for nectar (10%
(w/w) sugar, oilseed rape) with 5 ppb of TMX (concentration
found in nectar after seed treatment application [49]). However,
foragers can consume up to 1.80 ng/bee in 1 h of foraging for
nectar with 15 ppb of TMX (concentration found in nectar after
transplant-drip application [51]). TMX also is found at higher
concentrations in nectar (e.g. 17 ppb [52]; 19 ppb [51]; 20 ppb
[53]) and pollen (e.g. 127 ppb [52]) than those used in our
study. Further details on our neonicotinoid treatments are
provided in the electronic supplementary material.
3. Results
(a) Combined nutritional and neonicotinoid stressors
synergistically reduced survival
Survival was monitored up to 4 days after exposure to the
neonicotinoids. Sublethal and field-realistic doses of neonico-
tinoids did not significantly reduce survival when foragers
were fed ad libitum rich diets (Kaplan–Meier, p . 0.13; elec-
tronic
supplementary
material,
table
S1;
figure
1a,f ).
However, neonicotinoids significantly reduced the survival
of bees fed the ad libitum diets with qualities that were
intermediate (CLO; figure 1b) or poor (CLO and TMX,
Kaplan–Meier, p , 0.01; figure 1c,h). Bees fed higher pesticide
doses had significantly lower survival when compared with
control bees (CLO: within poor- and intermediate-quality diets
groups; TMX: within the poor-quality diet group) and lower
dose (CLO: within the poor-quality diet group) ( p , 0.0170,
Kaplan–MeierDS).
CLO and TMX also reduced the survival of bees fed lim-
ited-quantity diets with either rich (figure 1d,i) or poor
(figure 1e,j ) sugar qualities (Kaplan–Meier, p , 0.0001; elec-
tronic supplementary material, table S1). Specifically, higher
doses of both neonicotinoids significantly reduced survival
when compared with control and lower doses, at all diet qual-
ities ( p , 0.0170, Kaplan–MeierDS). Increased death of bees
fed neonicotinoids and poor-quality diets occurred 2–3 h
after treatment (up to 0%, 6% and 19% mortality, respect-
ively,
1 h,
2 h
and
3 h
after
treatment;
electronic
supplementary material, table S2).
There was a significant synergistic reduction in survival
elicited by all combinations of nutritional stresses (ad libitum
intermediate, ad libitum poor, limited high and limited poor) and
the higher pesticide dose (binomial proportion test, Holm cor-
rection; figure 2; electronic supplementary material, table S3).
Ad libitum poor diets synergistically reduced survival between
2–24 h (CLO and TMX, SESrange ¼ 5–33%; figure 2b,f), and
ad libitum intermediate diets synergistically reduced survival
between 3–24 h (CLO, SESrange ¼ 9–21%; figure 2a). There
was no significant synergistic effect on the survival of bees
exposed to the ad libitum intermediate diet and TMX. Limited
poor diets synergistically reduced survival between 2–10 h
(CLO,
SESrange ¼ 8–36%;
figure
2d)
and
3–8 h
(TMX,
SESrange ¼ 11–48%; figure 2h), and limited rich diets synergis-
tically reduced survival between 4–5 h (CLO, SESrange ¼ 39–
50%;
figure
2c)
and
3–6 h
(TMX,
SESrange ¼ 10–24%;
figure 2g).
Receiving no nutrients (i.e. starvation) was better than
receiving some nutrients with pesticides. Within the limited-
quantity diet trial, we tested an additional diet containing
no nutrients (10 ml of pure water). Bees fed the no nutrients
diet had significantly higher survival than those fed the lim-
ited-quantity diet of poor quality (10 ml of 15% sucrose
solution) containing the higher pesticide dose of either CLO
or TMX (electronic supplementary material, table S1 and
figure 1e,j ). The survival of bees fed the no nutrients diet
was significantly lower than that of bees fed limited poor
diets
containing
the
control
and
lower
dose
(TMX:
at
15–50%; CLO: at 50%; figure 1).
(b) Combined nutritional and neonicotinoid stressors
reduced sugar consumption
We assessed the sucrose consumption of bees fed the ad libi-
tum diet only because bees that received a limited-quantity
diet only had access to a fixed amount of food (10 ml). We cal-
culated the actual mass of pure sucrose consumed per bee per
day. There was no significant effect of CLO on sugar con-
sumption of foragers fed rich- and intermediate-quality diets
(GLMs, p . 1.40; electronic supplementary material, table
S4 and figure S1A). However, there was a significant effect
of CLO on consumption of bees fed a poor-quality diet
(GLMs,
p , 0.0001;
electronic
supplementary
material,
figure S1A). Specifically, control bees consumed significantly
more sucrose than lower (231%) and higher (248%) dose

Figure 2. Synergistic effects of nutritional and neonicotinoid stressors on bee survival across time. We tested the individual and combined effects of each nutritional stress (treatment A, blue, dashed lines) and the higher neonicotinoid sublethal

 bees, and lower dose bees consumed more than bees treated
with higher doses (225%, contrast testDS). There was no sig-
nificant effect of TMX on sucrose consumption at any diet
quality (GLM, p . 0.3; electronic supplementary material,
table S4 and figure S1B).
(c) Sublethal doses of neonicotinoids reduced glucose
and trehalose haemolymph levels
Glucose and trehalose haemolymph levels were only assessed
on bees fed the ad libitum-quantity diet, because insufficient
haemolymph was extractable from bees that were only fed
the limited-quantity diet
(10 ml). The haemolymph was
extracted 2 h after the neonicotinoid exposure. There was a
significant effect of CLO on glucose ( p ¼ 0.0092) and treha-
lose ( p ¼ 0.0021) haemolymph levels when foragers were
fed a diet of rich quality (50% sucrose) (GLM; electronic sup-
plementary material, table S5 and figure S2A). Specifically,
the haemolymph of control bees contained higher levels of
glucose than bees fed the higher (þ26%) and lower (þ27%)
CLO doses. Control bee haemolymph also contained higher
levels of trehalose than the haemolymph of bees fed the
CLO higher dose (þ26%, contrast testDS).
Likewise, there was a significant effect of TMX on glucose
(p ¼ 0.0122) haemolymph levels when foragers were fed diets
of rich quality (GLM; electronic supplementary material, table
S5 and figure S2B). Specifically, control bee haemolymph con-
tained higher levels of glucose than that of bees exposed to
lower (þ55%) and higher (þ60%) TMX doses (contrast testDS).
(d) Effects of nutritional deficits on pesticide-free bees
(i) Nutritional deficits decreased the survival of pesticide-free
bees
As expected, the survival of pesticide-free bees fed the
limited-quantity diet was significantly lower than the that of
pesticide-free bees fed the ad libitum diet (Kaplan–Meier,
x2 ¼ 762.32, d.f. ¼ 1, p , 0.0001).
There was a significant effect of diet quality on the survi-
val of pesticide-free foragers fed ad libitum (Kaplan–Meier,
p , 0.0001; electronic supplementary material, figure S3A and
table S6). Specifically, foragers fed lower-quality diets had a
significantly shorter survival (Kaplan–MeierDS, d.f. ¼ 1, p ,
0.0001; poor versus intermediate: x2 ¼ 35.62; poor versus rich:
x2 ¼ 100.16; intermediate versus rich: x2 ¼ 41.43; electronic
supplementary material, figure S3A).
There was a significant effect of diet quality on the survi-
val
of
pesticide-free
foragers
fed
limited-quantity
diets
(Kaplan–Meier, p , 0.0001; electronic supplementary material,
figure S3B and table S6). Specifically, bees fed lower-quality
diets
had
significantly reduced survival (Kaplan–Meier,
d.f. ¼ 1; poor versus rich: x2 ¼ 5.45, p ¼ 0.0196; no nutrients
versus rich: x2 ¼ 37.30, p , 0.0001; no nutrients versus poor:
x2 ¼ 9.02,
p ¼ 0.0027;
electronic
supplementary
material,
figure S3B).
(ii) Lower-quality diets reduced glucose and trehalose levels in
the haemolymph
In pesticide-free foragers, there was a significant effect of diet
quality on glucose (GLM, x7,2 ¼ 22.42, p , 0.0001) and treha-
lose
(GLM,
x7,2 ¼ 37.30,
p , 0.0001)
levels
(electronic
supplementary material, figure S3E,F). As expected, forager
haemolymph of bees fed rich diets contained significantly
higher levels of both glucose and trehalose than those fed
intermediate (þ49% andþ23%, respectively) and poor (þ68%
and þ48%) diets (contrast testDS).
(iii) Diet quality influenced sucrose consumption
There was a significant effect of diet quality on sucrose
consumption of pesticide-free foragers (GLMs, x7,2 ¼ 171.09,
p , 0.0001; electronic supplementary material, figure S3C).
Foragers consumed significantly less sucrose when they
were fed lower-quality diets (rich versus poor: 272%; rich
versus intermediate: 233%; intermediate versus poor: 258%,
contrast testDS; electronic supplementary material, figure
S3C). There was no significant effect of diet quality on the
volume of the sucrose solutions consumed daily by the fora-
gers (GLMs, x7,2 ¼ 1.43, p ¼ 0.488; electronic supplementary
material, figure S3D).
4. Discussion
One of the most common routes of honey bee pesticide
exposure is via foragers collecting nectar and pollen. We
demonstrate, for the first time, that nutritional stresses can
act synergistically with a sublethal, field-realistic pesticide
exposure and reduce honey bee survival. We also show that
the exposure to nutritional and pesticide stressors impairs
bee haemolymph energy levels and food consumption.
Although prior research demonstrated that a good pollen
diet can increase bee resistance to pesticides [21,23], and
that food quality influences the effect of toxins on arthropod
health [24–27], this is the first study to demonstrate the nega-
tive synergistic effects of sugar caloric restriction and
pesticides in animals.
Bees that did not undergo nutritional stress were not sig-
nificantly impaired by TMX or CLO. Forager survival was
not significantly altered by any field-realistic doses of these
neonicotinoids when they were fed optimal-quality and
-quantity sugar diets (electronic supplementary material,
table S1; figure 1a,f). This result also confirms that our
doses were sublethal. However, bees fed a poor nutritional
diet experienced detrimental synergistic effects, up to a 50%
mortality
increase
when
compared
with
the
expected
non-synergistic (additive) effects. Each neonicotinoid syner-
gistically reduced survival of bees fed diets of low quality
(32.5% and 15% sugar concentration) or quantity (limited
10 ml of sugar solution) (electronic supplementary material,
tables S1 and S3; figures 1 and 2). This adverse synergistic
effect of neonicotinoids and poor nutrition appeared rapidly
after treatment (2 h; electronic supplementary material, table
S2) and lasted up to 1 day (figure 2). Interestingly, starvation
was less severe than pesticide exposure: bees survived longer
when fed a pesticide-free diet containing no nutrients (pure
water), when compared with bees that consumed a sugar
diet of poor nutritional value, but containing a sublethal
dose of pesticide (electronic supplementary material, table
S1; figure 1e,j ).
The
combination
of
nutritional
and
neonicotinoid
stressors also reduced food consumption (electronic sup-
plementary material, figure S1). In all of our consumption
experiments, bees were only fed pure sucrose solutions. Neo-
nicotinoids were administered separately, prior to measuring
consumption. Consumption was therefore not influenced by

Proc. R. Soc. B 284: 20171711
6
 the presence of neonicotinoids in the sucrose solutions [54].
When foragers were fed the richest-quality diets, their con-
sumption
was
not
significantly
altered
by
any
prior
neonicotinoid exposure. However, all acute doses of CLO sig-
nificantly reduced subsequent food consumption when bees
were exposed to the poorest quality diet, suggesting that neo-
nicotinoids alter foragers’ energy metabolism or feeding
behaviour.
What accounts for this change in feeding? TMX reduced
forager motor functioning (acute exposure, 1.34 ng/bee;
2-day chronic exposure, rangeTMX daily doses ¼ 1.42–3.48 ng/
bee d21) and food consumption (1 day of chronic exposure)
[55]. The reduced motor functioning of neonicotinoid-treated
bees
may
lead
to
decreased
energy
consumption
and
food intake [55]. Similarly, Kessleret al. [54] showed that chronic
exposure to CLO (0.1–1 mM, 25–250 ppb) and TMX (0.1–1 mM,
29–292 ppb) reduced honey bee food consumption.
Neonicotinoid consumption also reduced sugar levels in
the haemolymph of bees, measured 2 h after pesticide
exposure (electronic supplementary material, figure S2).
CLO exposure significantly decreased both trehalose and glu-
cose
titres.
TMX
significantly
reduced
glucose
levels,
although TMX did not alter sucrose consumption at any
diet quality. TMX may have altered sugar metabolism.
These alterations were only significant when bees were fed
ad libitum diets of the richest quality. Bees fed ad libitum
diets of poorer quality had very low haemolymph sugar
levels (2 h after treatment) across all pesticide treatments. A
likely explanation is that the poorer-quality diets could not
fulfil bee nutritional requirements.
The food consumption and haemolymph sugar-level
alterations caused by neonicotinoids can disrupt forager
energy metabolism, which is important for honey bee
colony health [56]. Specifically, the neonicotinoid, imidaclo-
prid, inhibits mitochondria respiration and ATP synthesis
[57], and increases brain oxidative metabolism [58]. Similarly,
another pesticide (a triazole fungicide, myclobutanil) dis-
rupts energy production through reduced mitochondrial
regeneration and ATP production [59]. These energetic
changes may have broader behavioural effects, interfering
with thermoregulation [60], locomotion [55] and flight [61].
Flight is one of the most energy-intensive tasks [31], is fuelled
by sugar oxidation [32], requires flight muscle thermoregula-
tion [62] and is impaired by acute and chronic sublethal TMX
exposures [61].
Although CLO and TMX elicited similar results, CLO
exerted consistently stronger effects, which also appeared ear-
lier after exposure, when compared with TMX. This may have
occurred because TMX targets different nAChR subtypes
with a lower affinity than CLO [16]. In fact, CLO (LD50 ¼
4 ng/bee [47]) is more toxic than TMX (LD50 ¼ 5 ng/bee
[48]). Because approximately 36% of TMX degrades to its
main metabolic by-product, CLO [16,63], the toxicity of TMX
may be enhanced, to a degree, by its degradation to CLO.
In cockroaches, the impairing effect of TMX on locomotion is
correlated with its degradation to CLO [64].
As expected, richer sugar diets significantly increased sur-
vival (electronic supplementary material, figure S3A,B) and
haemolymph
energy
levels
(electronic
supplementary
material, figure S3E,F) in pesticide-free bees. Foragers con-
sumed roughly the same maximum amounts of sucrose
solution by volume because they consumed similar volumes
of food across diet treatments (64 +1 ml/bee d21, mean of all
pesticide-free diets; electronic supplementary material, figure
S3D). Bees are evidently unable to compensate for a diet with
low-sugar concentration by simply consuming a higher
volume of sugar solution. In fact, although the mean sugar
levels in the haemolymph of our bees were within the typical
concentrations of glucose (2–20 mg ml21) and trehalose (2–
40 mg ml21) [36,65–68], pesticide-free bees fed lower-quality
diets had also lower haemolymph energy levels (electronic
supplementary material, figure S3E,F).
Prior insect studies showed that nutritional deprivation
impairs the immune functions of the mealworm beetle
(Tenebrio molitor L.) [69] and decreases the longevity of the
housefly (Musca domestica L.) [70]. Sugar scarcity affects the
survival [71] and behaviour [72] of organisms with complex
sociality, such as ants. Our results show that nutrient depri-
vation
reduces
the
lifespan
of
honey
bees,
and
also
compromises their resistance and resilience (i.e. ability to
recover from the acute sublethal exposure) to pesticides.
These
data
highlight
the
fundamental
importance
of
high-quality carbohydrate food for bees.
The behavioural and physiological impairments showed
in our study probably compromise bee health, contributing
to a broader variety of sublethal side effects (for reviews
see [15,19]). Nutrition and pesticide stressors could trigger
synergistic effects on other bee species. When compared
with honey bees, bumblebees consume more food, while stor-
ing a lower quantity of it. They are, therefore, more
dependent on available nectar sources than honey bees,
while being similarly exposed to pesticides. In addition, bum-
blebee food consumption can be widely altered by chronic
exposures to neonicotinoids, such as CLO (0.1–1 mM and
10 mg l21), TMX (1, 4, 39 and 98 mg kg21) and imidacloprid
(0.001–1 mM and 0.8–125 mg l21) [54,73–75].
Current risk-assessment (RA) procedures used for testing
chemicals do not fully take into account our current under-
standing of bee toxicology and health [22,26,76–78]. Our
results raise further concerns by suggesting that the sugar
diet regime typically used for RA toxicity tests may strongly
influence pesticide toxicity. For example, the standard RA
guideline for LD50 toxicity tests requires feeding bees with
50% (w/v) sucrose solutions ad libitum [46]. The results of
these toxicity tests, obtained by feeding bees with an optimal
nutritional diet, may underestimate the toxic effect that
chemicals elicit on bees in the field, where foragers can be
exposed to a combined nutritional stress (i.e. low-sugar
nectar) [7,10,17,19]. Thus, the consequences of low-sugar
nectar and neonicotinoid (TMX and CLO) exposure should
be considered in assessing risks on insect pollinators. We
suggest that RA procedures should test pesticide effects at
various nutritional quality levels. More broadly, combined
animal exposure to xenobiotic and nutritional stressors is a
highly relevant ecological scenario that deserves greater
attention.
