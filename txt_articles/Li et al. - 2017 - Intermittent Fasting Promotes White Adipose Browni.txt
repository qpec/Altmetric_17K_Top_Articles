Due to typographical errors in the preparation of this manuscript, several occurrences of 
“μg/ml” were written as “mg/ml.” In the STAR Methods section, under the heading Gut 
Microbiota Transplantation, the original sentence read as follows: “In brief, fresh antibiotics 
(1 mg/ml bacitracin, 170 mg/ml gentamycin, 125 mg/ml ciprofloxacin, 100 mg/ml 
neomycin, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml metronidazole, 100 mg/ml ceftazidime, 50 
mg/ml streptomycin and 50 mg/ml vancomycin, Sigma) were added into the drinking water 
of mice, and changed once a week.” The actual antibiotic concentrations were as follows: 1 
μg/ml bacitracin, 170 μg/ml gentamycin, 125 μg/ml ciprofloxacin, 100 μg/ml neomycin, 100 
U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml metronidazole, 100 μg/ml ceftazidime, 50 μg/ml streptomycin 
and 50 μg/ml vancomycin. This has since been corrected online.
Additionally, the full metagenomics dataset has now been submitted to the NCBI Sequence 
Read Archive (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under the original accession number, 
Bioproject ID PRJNA398633.
