In Brief
Using a genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9
screen, Han et al. demonstrate that the
major hit, the sialic acid transporter
SLC35A1, is an essential host factor for
IAV entry. In addition, they identify the
DNA-binding transcriptional repressor
CIC as a negative regulator of cell-
intrinsic immunity.

SUMMARY
The emergence of influenza A viruses (IAVs) from zoo-
notic reservoirs poses a great threat to human health.
As seasonal vaccines are ineffective against zoonotic
strains, and newly transmitted viruses can quickly
acquire drug resistance, there remains a need for
host-directed therapeutics against IAVs. Here, we
performed a genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9 knockout
screen in human lung epithelial cells with a human
isolateofanavian H5N1 strain.Severalgenesinvolved
in sialic acid biosynthesis and related glycosylation
pathways were highly enriched post-H5N1 selection,
including SLC35A1, a sialic acid transporter essential
for IAV receptor expression and thus viral entry.
Importantly, we have identified capicua (CIC) as a
negative regulator of cell-intrinsic immunity, as loss
of CIC resulted in heightened antiviral responses
and restricted replication of multiple viruses. There-
fore, our study demonstrates that the CRISPR/Cas9
systemcanbeutilizedforthediscoveryofhost factors
critical for the replication of intracellular pathogens.
INTRODUCTION
Influenza A virus (IAV) is an upper respiratory pathogen in humans
with the ability to rapidly evolve, resulting in both seasonal epi-
demics and occasional pandemics (Wright et al., 2013). As the
constant emergence of variant- and drug-resistant strains greatly
reduce the efficacy of current vaccines and therapies, there
remains a need for host-directed therapeutics against IAVs. Mul-
tiple genome-wide screening approaches, including small inter-
fering RNA (siRNA), proteomic, and insertional mutagenesis
screens, have been employed to identify host factors involved
in IAV infection (Hao et al., 2008; Brass et al., 2009; Karlas
et al., 2010; Ko
¨ nig et al., 2010; Ward et al., 2012; Su et al.,
2013; Benitez et al., 2015; Shapira et al., 2009; Sui et al., 2009;
Watanabe et al., 2014). Although some common hits and path-
ways were revealed, most notably members of the vacuolar
ATPase family, meta-analyses demonstrated little overlap in the
identified IAV host factors, likely because of differences in the
strains used, time points assayed, and functional readouts cho-
sen (Mehle and Doudna, 2010; Stertz and Shaw, 2011; Watanabe
et al., 2010). Therefore, alternative screening strategies will pro-
vide the flexibility needed to uncover host factors and pathways,
as well as validate previously identified hits, to serve as potential
targets for the development of anti-influenza therapeutics.
Recent advancements in CRISPR/Cas9 technology have al-
lowed for gene disruption on a genome-wide scale in mamma-
lian cells (Shalem et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014; Wright et al.,
2016). Recently, the GeCKO (genome-wide CRISPR knockout)
screening strategy has been utilized to investigate virus-host in-
teractions (Haga et al., 2016; Ma et al., 2015; Marceau et al.,
2016; Orchard et al., 2016; Park et al., 2017a; Savidis et al.,
2016; Zhang et al., 2016). Here, we generated a GeCKO library
in human lung epithelial (A549) cells negatively selected against
genes essential for cell viability and subjected this A549-GeCKO
library to five rounds of lethal infection with a human isolate of an
avian IAV strain. Deep sequencing analysis of the enriched single
guide RNA (sgRNA) population identified numerous genes
involved in the sialic acid biosynthesis and glycosylation path-
ways, as well as in the regulation of cell-intrinsic immunity. Vali-
dation studies revealed host factors critical for multiple IAV
strains that function at different stages of viral replication,
including entry and antiviral responses. Loss of SLC35A1, a
CMP-sialic acid transporter, rendered cells resistant to IAV infec-
tion because of the absence of cell-surface sialic acids. Further-
more, GeCKO screening identified capicua (CIC), a DNA-binding
transcriptional repressor, as a negative regulator of cell-intrinsic
immunity. Loss of CIC resulted in upregulation of antiviral
responses and restricted replication of viruses from diverse
families. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that GeCKO
screening is a versatile strategy that can be utilized to identify
host factors critical for IAV replication.
RESULTS
Generation of an A549-GeCKO Library
To identify host genes critical for IAV replication, we generated a
GeCKO library in A549 cells as previously described and per-
formed a genome-scale loss-of-function genetic screen (Shalem
etal., 2014;Wangetal., 2014;Zhangetal.,2016).First, wederived

(A) Overview of GeCKO screen in human lung epithelial (A549) cells. Steps 1–4: Cas9-expressing A549 (Cas9-A549) cells were transduced with lentivirus
containing sgRNA library A and selected for 14 days in puromycin to generate the A549-GeCKO library. Steps 5–7: the A549-GeCKO library was infected with a
low-pathogenic H5N1 (VN04Low) to obtain resistant cells. Steps 8a–9: preliminary consecutive screen: surviving cells were subjected to a total of five rounds of
H5N1 infection with minimal expansion of resistant cells. Steps 8b–9: sequential screen: surviving cells were subjected to a total of five rounds of H5N1 infection
with substantial expansion of resistant cells between each round. Step 10: validation and characterization of selected hits.

 a clonal Cas9-expressing A549 cell line (Cas9-A549s) by trans-
ducing wild-type (WT) A549 cells with lentivirus expressing the
Cas9 gene (Figure 1A, step 1). Next, Cas9-A549s were trans-
duced with lentivirus containing a pooled human genome-wide
sgRNA library (library A) of 65,383 sgRNAs targeting 19,050 pro-
tein-coding genes and 1,864 microRNA (miRNA) precursors and
selected in puromycin for 14 days (Figure 1A, steps 2–4) (Sanjana
et al., 2014; Shalem et al., 2014). To evaluate sgRNA diversity in
theA549-GeCKO library,we PCR-amplifiedthe integrated sgRNA
cassettes from genomic DNA and subjected them to Illumina
sequencing. Analysis of the 9 M reads obtained from 1 3 108 cells
revealed thepresenceof 62,659 sgRNAs (R10 reads)in the A549-
GeCKO library, representing an average coverage of �1403 per
sgRNA (Figures S1A and S1B). The loss of �4.2% of sgRNAs
post-puromycin selection likely suggests the negative selection
of a non-viable cell population. Thus, we successfully generated
a pooled GeCKO library in A549 cells with sufficient coverage to
perform genetic screens for IAV host factors.
Preliminary Screen for Positive Selection of
H5N1-Resistant Cells in the A549-GeCKO Library
To enrich for a cell population resistant to IAV replication, we
subjected the A549-GeCKO library to lethal infection with a hu-
man isolate of a low pathogenic avian H5N1 virus (A/Vietnam/
1203/04, VN04Low; Figure 1A, steps 5–7). For our preliminary
GeCKO screen, we performed five consecutive rounds (Rd) of le-
thal infection with minimal expansion of cells between rounds
(preliminary consecutive screen); the resistant cells were subse-
quently expanded, and sgRNA distribution was assessed by Illu-
mina sequencing (Prelim Rd5; Figure 1A, steps 8a–9). For the 8 M
Illumina reads obtained from Prelim Rd5, we observed robust
enrichment of 586 sgRNAs (R10 reads) representing �1% of
the sgRNAs present in the A549-GeCKO library (Figures S1A
and S1C). Next, candidate genes were identified and ranked us-
ing the model-based analysis of genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9
knockout (MAGeCK) program (Li et al., 2014). We observed
positive selection of 119 genes in Prelim Rd5 (p < 0.1), with the
SLC35A1 gene (sialic acid transporter) ranked highest and
demonstrating representation by all 3 independent sgRNAs
(Table S1). Interestingly, the remaining genes showed enrich-
ment for a single sgRNA, likely because of the stringent selection
achieved by performing five consecutive rounds of lethal infec-
tion with minimal expansion of cells between rounds. Together,
our preliminary screen identified potential host factors whose
loss rendered cells highly resistant to H5N1 infection.
Analysis of sgRNA Enrichment during Sequential H5N1
Selection
Next, we performed a less stringent GeCKO screen by allowing
for substantial expansion of surviving cells between each round
of H5N1 selection (sequential screen; Figure 1A, steps 8b–9).
This would allow us to determine if progressive enrichment of
sgRNAs occurs at each round of selection, such that genes crit-
ical for H5N1 replication are represented by multiple sgRNAs in
the earlier rounds. We assessed sgRNA representation at each
round of infection in duplicate sample sets up to five rounds.
Comparative analysis of sgRNA representation between the
A549-GeCKO library and Rd1 of the sequential screen showed
no significant differences (Figures 1B and S1A). In contrast, we
observed robust enrichment of specific sgRNAs at Rd2, with a
progressive increase in enrichment occurring between Rd2-5.
These data indicate that selection of a cell population less
permissive to H5N1 occurs after two rounds of lethal infection.
Next, we performed principle component analysis (PCA) and
PearsoncorrelationanalysistounderstandthesgRNA distribution
pattern betweenbiologicalreplicatesinthesequentialscreen.The
sgRNA distribution profile of Replicate one (Rep1, red) and Repli-
cate two (Rep2, blue) at Rd1 clustered together and remained
close to the A549-GeCKO library; however, in subsequent rounds
(Rd2 to Rd5), the samples belonging to each replicate closely
clustered within their respective groups, indicating divergence
of replicates after Rd2 (Figure S1D). Similarly, comparison of indi-
vidual sample sets showed strong correlation of sgRNA distribu-
tion between Rep1 and Rep2 at Rd1, with a correlation coeffi-
cient value of 0.92; however, the correlation coefficient value
decreased to %0.25 in subsequent rounds (Figure S1E). Although
replicate divergence occurred at Rd2, we observed enrichment of
specific sgRNAs common in both replicates (Table S1). Taken
together, these results demonstrate that the robust enrichment
seen at Rd2 of the sequential screen occurred concurrently with
replicate divergence, yet revealed the progressive enrichment of
a common sgRNA population between replicates.
Identification of Genes Enriched during Sequential
H5N1 Selection
Next, we performed MAGeCK analysis to identify positively
selected genes at Rd2 and Rd5 of the sequential screen
(Table S1). We observed enrichment of 798 genes (p < 0.05) at
Rd2, with 161 genes represented by two or more sgRNAs and
637 genes represented by a single sgRNA (Figure 1C). However,
we observed enrichment of 501 genes (p < 0.05) at Rd5, with only
16 genes represented by two or more sgRNAs, and 485 genes
represented by a single sgRNA. This decrease in the number of
genes represented by multiple sgRNAs between Rd2 and Rd5
suggests that stringent H5N1 selection results in the preferential
enrichment of individual sgRNAs. To further evaluate the genes
identified at Rd5, we compared our hits to factors identified in
the nine previously reported genome-wide screens for influenza
virus (Brass et al., 2009; Hao et al., 2008; Karlas et al., 2010; Ko
¨ nig
et al., 2010; Su et al., 2013; Ward et al., 2012; Shapira et al., 2009;
individual sgRNAs. sgRNAs are distributed by quartile, where the boxes represent the middle quartiles (25%–75% distribution), and the lines and dots represent
sgRNAs in the upper and the lower 25% of the distribution.

(p < 0.05) and mapped to corresponding genes.

Cell Reports 23, 596–607, April 10, 2018
 Sui et al., 2009; Watanabe et al., 2014). Comparative analyses of
the hits identified at Rd5 (p < 0.05), excluding miRNAs, indicated
that 33 of the 453 hits were also identified in previous screens
(Figure 1D; Table S2). Vacuolar ATPase family members, which
were highly represented in six of the prior screens, were also
highly enriched in the sequential screen (ATP6AP1, ATP6AP2,
ATP6V0A1, ATP6V0B, ATP6V0C, ATP6V1B2, ATP6V1G1, and
ATP6V1H) (Mehle and Doudna, 2010; Stertz and Shaw, 2011;
Watanabe et al., 2010). In addition, we identified >400 unique
genes, demonstrating that GeCKO screening can reveal previ-
ously unidentified IAV host factors.
Next, we used the R package for reactome pathway analysis
to identify enriched biological processes and determined that
117 genes from Rd2 and 133 genes from Rd5 (p < 0.05) mapped
to known biological processes (Figure 1E; Table S3) (Yu and He,
2016). We observed enrichment for genes involved in proton
transport and vacuolar acidification, which were represented
in the prior genome-wide screens for influenza virus (Figure 1D;
Table S2). We also observed enrichment for genes involved

and

tidylinositol (GPI)-anchor synthesis, as
well as genes involved in intracellular
signaling pathways, regulation of cell-
intrinsic immunity, and autophagy. There-
fore, the GeCKO screening confirmed
previously described processes, such
as vacuolar acidification, and highlighted
other processes, including sialic acid
biosynthesis and glycan modification,
that are important for IAV replication.
Confirmation of Top Hits via
Individual Gene KO
To prioritize the candidate host factors
for further validation, we identified the
common genes in the sequential (Rd5)
versus consecutive (Prelim Rd5) screens
(Figure 2A; Table S4). Of the 63 genes in common, we selected
11 highly enriched candidates representing various biological
processes for the generation of individual CRISPR KO cell
lines (Table 1). Eight hits (SLC35A1, GDF11, IRX3, C2CD4C,
TRIM23, PIGN, ACADSB, and GRAMD2) were also highly en-
riched (p < 0.05) in the early rounds of selection (Rd2), and the
remaining three hits (CIC, JAK2, and PIAS3) demonstrated
enrichment only after multiple rounds of selection (Figure S2).
To determine if these candidate genes are important for IAV
replication, the 11 generated polyclonal KOs were infected
with H5N1 at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI). A >60% reduc-
tion in viral titer was observed in eight KOs as compared to vec-
tor control cells, demonstrating that GeCKO screening was suc-
cessful in identifying H5N1 host factors in A549 cells (Figure 2B).
As we anticipated incomplete disruption of target gene loci in
the polyclonal population, we next generated seven clonal KOs
for a subset of host factors. Sequence analysis of the sgRNA
target sites in the clonal KOs indicated that complete gene
disruption was achieved in all but the CIC KOs, which contained
Cell Reports 23, 596–607, April 10, 2018
599
 a WT allele (Table S5). We evaluated H5N1 replication in the
clonal KOs, and observed an �5 log reduction in viral titer in
SLC35A1 and CIC KOs, as well as a >80% reduction in viral titer
in the remaining KOs as compared to vector control cells (Fig-
ure 2C). The robust reduction in H5N1 titer observed in the clonal
KOs as compared to their respective polyclonal populations
suggests that complete gene disruption was required for the
validation of candidate host factors. To exclude the possibility
of off-target effects in the clonal KOs, we analyzed the sgRNA
sequences for potential complementarity in the exons of the
human genome (Table S6). A minimum of 3-4 mismatches
were required for identification of potential off-target genes,
the majority of which were not enriched at Rd2 and Rd5 of the
sequential screen (p < 0.05). As the seven evaluated clonal
KOs demonstrated robust reduction in H5N1 viral titer and
limited potential for off-target effects, we have thus confirmed
that these hits are important for H5N1 replication.
Validation of Hits with Multiple IAV Strains
To determine if the validated host factors are required for the
replication of multiple IAV strains, we infected the clonal KOs
with H1N1 (A/Puerto Rico/8/1934; PR8) and H3N2 (A/Hong
Kong/1/1968; HK68) at a low MOI. We observed a >5 log reduc-
tion in viral titer in SLC35A1 KOs and a >3 log reduction in viral
titer in CIC KOs as compared to vector control cells (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, PIAS3 KOs demonstrated strain specificity, as a
>80% reduction in viral titer was observed for H1N1 and
H5N1, yet H3N2 replication was unaffected. The remaining
clonal KOs showed a >60% reduction in viral titers for both
H1N1 and H3N2, demonstrating that the identified host factors
are important for efficient replication of multiple IAV strains.
To distinguish between IAV-specific host factors and those
that function in a pan-proviral manner, we assayed the replica-
tion of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) in the clonal KOs. VSV
replication was unaffected in SLC35A1 and PIGN KOs; however,
we observed a >2 log reduction in viral titer in CIC KOs and
a R50% reduction in viral titer in the remaining KOs (Figure 2C).
Taken together, these data suggest that SLC35A1 and PIGN
are IAV-specific host factors, whereas C2CD4C, TRIM23, CIC,
JAK2, and PIAS3 may function in a pan-proviral manner to sup-
port viral replication.
Identification of Viral Life-Cycle Defects in Clonal KO
Cells
To elucidate the mechanism by which the identified host factors
contribute to IAV replication, we evaluated various stages of the
viral life cycle in a subset of clonal KOs. First, to identify host fac-
tors that are critical for a single IAV infection cycle, we performed
synchronized infections at a high MOI with H5N1. We observed
an �1–2 log reduction in viral titer in SLC35A1 and in CIC KOs as
compared to vector control cells, indicating that loss of these
host factors resulted in inefficient establishment or completion
of the viral life cycle (Figure 3A). In contrast, the remaining clonal
KOs displayed only modest differences in viral titer, suggesting
that the defects observed at a low MOI were due to the cumula-
tive effects of multiple replication cycles.
Next, we utilized beta-lactamase carrying influenza virus-like
particles (flu VLPs) to measure the ability of the clonal KOs to
support virion entry and/or fusion, in comparison to VSV glyco-
protein (VSV-G) VLPs (Tscherne et al., 2010). SLC35A1 KOs
showed robust restriction of IAV entry and/or fusion, as only
�3.6% of cells were positive for flu VLP infection (Figure 3B).
In addition, only 25% of PIAS3 KOs were positive for flu VLP
infection, suggesting a role for PIAS3 in IAV entry and/or fusion.
In contrast, no defects in flu VLP infection were observed for the
remaining KOs, and VSV-G VLP infection was largely unaffected
in all of the tested KOs. These results demonstrate that SLC35A1
and PIAS3 play a critical role in the entry and/or fusion stage of
the IAV life cycle.
To determine if the remaining host factors are required at a
post-fusion stage of the IAV life cycle, we measured primary
viral transcription and viral genome replication of H1N1 in the
clonal KOs. At 3 hpi, primary nucleoprotein (NP) transcript (NP
mRNA) and input viral genomic NP RNA (NP vRNA) levels were
measured by qRT-PCR. As SLC35A1 KOs demonstrated de-
fects in viral entry and/or fusion, we observed low levels of input
NP vRNA and consequently low levels of NP transcription as
compared to vector control cells (Figure 3C). Interestingly, NP
mRNA levels were reduced >90% in CIC KOs as compared to
vector control cells, despite displaying similar levels of input
NP vRNA. Next, we assessed the clonal KOs for defects in viral
genome replication at 6 hpi by qRT-PCR. In CIC KOs, we
observed an �80% reduction in both NP vRNA and mRNA as
compared to vector control cells, indicating that the observed
reduction in primary transcription impaired subsequent genome
replication. Thus, CIC KOs demonstrate a defect in IAV replica-
tion at a stage between post-fusion and primary transcription.
As dysregulation of cell-intrinsic immunity may inhibit IAV
replication, we evaluated the expression of antiviral genes by
qRT-PCR under basal (mock) and H1N1-infected conditions.
CIC and JAK2 KOs demonstrated an increase in antiviral gene
expression (>2-fold) for both mock and H1N1-infected condi-
tions as compared to vector control cells (Figures 3D, 3E,
and S3A). Interestingly, in comparison to vector control cells,
PIAS3 KOs displayed higher antiviral gene expression only

 upon IAV infection. To further validate our findings, we confirmed
the loss of JAK2 protein expression in JAK2 KOs by western blot
analysis (Figure S3B). In addition, we complemented JAK2 KOs
with cDNA expressing JAK2 and observed increased viral repli-
cation (R1 log) as compared to GFP expressing JAK2 KOs, indi-
cating that only loss of the JAK2 gene resulted in the observed
viral replication defects in JAK2 KOs (Figure S3C). These data
demonstrate that CIC, JAK2, and PIAS3 KOs display dysregu-
lated antiviral gene expression. Taken together, our studies
show that SCL35A1 KOs display defects in viral entry and/or
fusion and CIC KOs demonstrate restriction of IAV replication
between post-fusion and primary transcription as well as dysre-
gulation of antiviral gene expression.

and GPI-anchor synthesis (PIGN, DPM2) (Figures 4A and S4A).
Of these host factors, SLC35A1 was the highest enriched gene
and was represented by 3 independent sgRNAs (Figure S2). As
SLC35A1 is a CMP-sialic acid (CMP-Neu5Ac) transporter, we
hypothesized that SLC35A1 KOs lack cell-surface sialic acids
(Hadley et al., 2014). To this end, we used specific lectins to
detect 20-30 (Maackia amurensis lectin [MAL]) or 20-6’ (Sambucus
nigra lectin [SNA]) linked sialic acid on the cell surface. Flow
cytometry and confocal microscopy analyses of SLC35A1 KOs
showed a lack of binding for both types of lectins as compared
to vector control cells, indicating the loss of cell-surface sialic
acid in the absence of SLC35A1 (Figures 4B and 4C). Next,
we evaluated the efficiency of recombinant HA (H5) binding.
SLC35A1 KOs were unable to support HA binding as compared
to vector control cells, indicating that the reduced susceptibility
of SLC35A1 KOs was due to inefficient binding of IAV particles to
the cell surface (Figure 4D).

 As there are currently no inhibitors available against SLC35A1,
we sought to determine if inhibition of downstream sialyltrans-
ferases with 3Fax-Peracetyl Neu5Ac (3F-Neu5Ac), a CMP-
Neu5Ac analog, would inhibit IAV replication (Rillahan et al.,
2012). Treatment of WT A549 cells with 3F-Neu5Ac resulted in
robust restriction of H1N1 and H3N2 replication as compared
to DMSO-treated cells (Figure 4E). Interestingly, H5N1 replica-
tion was unaltered in 3F-Neu5Ac-treated cells, despite display-
ing almost complete loss of lectin binding (Figure 4F). To exclude
the possibility of other defects that may result in the restriction of
IAV infection in SLC35A1 KOs, we complemented SLC35A1 KOs
with cDNA expressing SLC35A1. We observed increased IAV
replication in complemented SLC35A1 KOs, yet observed no dif-
ferences in VSV replication (Figure 4G). In addition, expression of
SLC35A1 in WT A549 cells did not alter IAV replication (Fig-
ure S4B). These studies demonstrate that SLC35A1 facilitates
incorporation of sialic acid moieties onto cell-surface proteins,
and thus is an essential host factor for IAV entry.
Capicua Is a Negative Regulator of Cell-Intrinsic
Immunity
Our studies show that capicua (CIC) is critical for both IAV and
VSV replication (Figure 2C). CIC is a conserved DNA-binding
transcriptional repressor that functions in conjunction with
the co-repressor Ataxin1 (ATXN1) or its paralog ATXN1-Like
(ATXN1L) (Ajuria et al., 2011; Jime
´ nez et al., 2012). There are
two major isoforms of CIC: short (CIC-S) and long (CIC-L), ex-
pressed from independent start codons (Figure S5A). To further
understand the role of CIC in virus replication, we first confirmed
our findings in new CIC KOs generated with an independent
sgRNA (CIC KO2s). Loss of CIC expression in CIC KO2s was
confirmed by western blot analysis and sequencing of the
sgRNA target site (Figure S5B; Table S5). In agreement with pre-
vious findings, we observed decreased levels of ATXN1L protein
as well as increased expression of a CIC-regulated gene, ETV4,
in CIC KO2s (Figures S5B and S5C) (Dissanayake et al., 2011;
Lee et al., 2011). As previously observed, CIC KO2s also demon-
strated an �2–3 log reduction in the replication of various IAV
strains, as well as a R 1 log reduction in VSV, encephalomyocar-
ditis virus (EMCV), and Zika virus replication (Figures 2C and 5A).
As anticipated, we observed higher antiviral gene expression in
CIC KO2s under basal (mock) and H1N1-infected conditions
as compared to vector control cells (Figures 5B–5D). Together,
these data suggest that loss of CIC results in a heightened anti-
viral state, rendering cells less permissive to viral replication.
As loss of CIC resulted in higher antiviral gene expression, we
hypothesized that ectopic expression of CIC would suppress the
activity of antiviral gene promoters. Thus, we generated lucif-
erase reporters under the control of the human IFIT1 and MxA
promoters. Co-expression of CIC and ATXN1 resulted in a
dose dependent decrease in IFIT1 reporter activity (up to
�50%) upon RIG-I stimulation as compared to GFP control, to
a greater extent than expression of CIC or ATXN1 alone (Fig-
ure 5E). Similarly, an �40% reduction in MxA reporter activity
was observed upon co-expression of CIC and ATXN1. As our
results indicate that CIC can repress antiviral gene expression,
we investigated if downregulation of CIC occurs upon infection
to facilitate the induction of antiviral genes.
Western blot analysis of H1N1-infected vector control cells
demonstrated a rapid decline in CIC protein levels between
40–60 min post-infection (Figure 5F). qRT-PCR analysis of
H1N1-infected vector control cells showed an �50% decrease
in CIC mRNA levels, demonstrating that both CIC mRNA and
protein levels are downregulated in response to IAV infection
(Figure 5G). Taken together, GeCKO screening has identified
CIC as a negative regulator of cell-intrinsic immunity.
DISCUSSION
Here, we performed a GECKO screen using a human isolate of
an avian H5N1 strain and identified host factors critical for IAV
entry and regulation of cell-intrinsic immunity. Cells lacking the
sialic acid transporter SLC35A1 were highly enriched post-
H5N1 selection, as they were deficient in the viral receptor and
thus were incapable of supporting HA binding. sgRNAs targeting
several genes involved in sialic acid biosynthesis and related
glycosylation pathways were also enriched during H5N1 selec-
tion. In addition, we identified CIC, a DNA-binding transcriptional
repressor, as a key regulator of cell-intrinsic immunity. CIC-defi-
cient cells demonstrated upregulated antiviral gene expression
and decreased replication of multiple viruses. Taken together,
GeCKO screening can be a powerful tool to discover host factors
and to highlight biological pathways essential for the replication
of intracellular pathogens.
For this study, we employed a pooled GeCKO approach,
relying upon gene disruption and stringent selection to enrich
for a cell population resistant to IAV infection. As opposed to
siRNA-based screening, it has been reported that cell-sur-
vival-based GeCKO screens for viral host factors predomi-
nantly reveal hits that support early steps of viral replication
(Perreira et al., 2016; Savidis et al., 2016). Similarly, we
observed robust enrichment of host factors important for sialic
acid (IAV receptor) expression as well as vacuolar acidification
and endocytosis (Figure 1E; Table S3). Of these identified entry
factors, several members of the vacuolar ATPase family were
previously identified in multiple siRNA screens (Mehle and
Doudna, 2010; Stertz and Shaw, 2011b; Watanabe et al.,
2010; Figure 1D; Table S2). Interestingly, SLC35A1 was

 identified in only one of the prior siRNA screens, and knock-
down demonstrated an �50% decrease in H1N1 (PR8) infec-
tion (Brass et al., 2009). In this GeCKO screen, SLC35A1 was
the highest enriched hit and gene knockout displayed an
�5 log decrease in viral replication for multiple IAV strains (Fig-
ure 2C). In addition, several host factors critical for sialic acid
biosynthesis and related glycosylation pathways were uniquely
enriched in this GeCKO screen (Figures 4A and S4A) (Chu and
Whittaker, 2004; de Vries et al., 2012). In agreement, a survival-
based haploid screen for enterovirus D68, which also utilizes
sialic acid as an entry receptor, showed enrichment of host fac-
tors necessary for cell-surface sialic acid expression (Baggen
et al., 2016). Thus, survival-based GeCKO screening allows
for the identification of host factors critical for the early steps
of viral replication.
In addition to the identification of viral entry host factors,
GeCKO screening revealed factors important for the regulation
of cell-intrinsic immunity. In our validation studies, we observed
higher levels of antiviral gene expression in CIC, JAK2, and
PIAS3 KOs (Figures 3D and 3E); however, loss of these host
factors impacted different steps of the IAV life cycle (Figures
3A–3C). JAK2 was previously identified in one of the siRNA
screens and implicated in IAV entry (Ko
¨ nig et al., 2010). How-
ever, in JAK2 KOs, we observed no defects in flu VLP entry
yet decreased genome replication at 6 hpi. It is possible that
increased antiviral gene expression may suppress IAV genome
replication in JAK2 KOs. In another study, JAK2 was implicated
in the intracellular localization of the viral M1 protein through
tyrosine phosphorylation (Ko
¨ nig et al., 2010; Wang et al.,
2013). Therefore, further studies are necessary to delineate
the role of JAK2 in IAV replication. In PIAS3 KOs, we observed
increased antiviral gene expression only upon IAV infection,
as well as defects in flu VLP entry and primary transcription.
Interestingly, PIAS3, an E3 SUMO ligase, has been shown to
SUMOylate RAC1 and modulate cytoskeletal rearrangement;
thus, it is possible that PIAS3 plays a role in IAV endocytosis
(Castillo-Lluva et al., 2010). In addition, it has previously been
shown that PIAS1 and PIAS3 negatively regulate STAT-medi-
ated signaling and IRF1 transcriptional activity, suggesting
that PIAS3 may be important for modulating cell-intrinsic immu-
nity (Nakagawa and Yokosawa, 2002). These findings suggest
that JAK2 and PIAS3 are important for the regulation of cell-
intrinsic immunity, yet may function at different steps of the
IAV life cycle.
CIC in conjunction with the co-repressor Ataxin1 (ATXN1) or
its paralog ATXN1-like (ATXN1L) has been implicated in cancer
development and progression, as well as neuropathology and
autoimmunity (Bettegowda et al., 2011; Lam et al., 2006; Oki-
moto et al., 2017; Park et al., 2017b). However, CIC has not
been shown to play a role in the regulation of cell-intrinsic
immunity. In our validation studies, we observed robust restric-
tion of RNA viruses from diverse families and increased anti-
viral gene expression in CIC KO2s (Figures 5A–5D). In agree-
ment, a previous study demonstrated increased levels of
proinflammatory cytokines in CIC-L-deficient mice (Kim et al.,
2015). In addition, we observed repression of IFIT1 and MxA
reporter activity upon ectopic expression of CIC with the co-
repressor ATXN1 (Figure 5E). As CIC has been previously
demonstrated to function as a DNA-binding transcriptional
repressor, it is possible that CIC suppresses antiviral gene
expression via its transcriptional repressor activity (Jime
´ nez
et al., 2012). Furthermore, our studies demonstrate downregu-
lation of CIC protein and RNA levels upon IAV infection (Fig-
ures 5F and 5G). As viral infections activate MAPK pathways,
and the activation of MAPK pathways result in the downregu-
lation of CIC, it is possible that CIC degradation during IAV
infection occurs via MAPK signaling (Ajuria et al., 2011; Dissa-
nayake et al., 2011; Pleschka, 2008). Previous studies show
that CIC degradation can be inhibited by the COP9 signalo-
some (Suisse et al., 2017). Interestingly, multiple members of
the COP9 complex have been identified as IAV host factors;
thus, it is tempting to speculate that viruses may usurp the
COP9 signalosome to prevent CIC degradation and thereby
repress host antiviral gene expression (Tripathi et al., 2015).
Future studies will determine the mechanisms of CIC regula-
tion during viral infection.
In conclusion, GeCKO screening is a powerful alternative
strategy for the identification of host factors and biological path-
ways critical for the replication of multiple influenza viruses.
Host pathways required for expression of the viral receptor
sialic acid were uniquely enriched in this GeCKO screen, with
the highest enrichment observed for SLC35A1, a sialic acid
transporter. In addition to highlighting biological pathways, our
GeCKO screen identified CIC as a host factor important for
the regulation of cell-intrinsic immunity. Our studies show that
CIC suppresses antiviral gene expression and suggest that
CIC levels are regulated during viral infection to facilitate robust
induction of antiviral responses. Therefore, we demonstrate that
GeCKO screening is an invaluable tool for the discovery of host
factors essential for the replication of intracellular pathogens
and for the identification of targets for the development of
host-directed therapeutics.

 EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
A549-GeCKO Library Generation and H5N1 Screen
The A549-GeCKO library was generated using the lentiGuide-Puro (#52963,
Addgene) two-vector system for Cas9 and sgRNA delivery as previously
described (Sanjana et al., 2014). Briefly, Cas9-A549 cells were generated
via
lentivirus
transduction
of
the
Cas9
transgene
(lentiCas9-BLAST,
#52962, Addgene), followed by selection with 5 mg/ml blasticidin. Clonal
Cas9-A549 cells were further transduced with lentivirus particles containing
the human sgRNA library (Human GeCKO v2 Library A Cat#1000000049,
Addgene) at MOI = 0.3 to attain no greater than 1 sgRNA per cell and
selected with both 1 mg/ml puromycin and 5 mg/ml blasticidin for 14 days
to achieve >95% gene disruption (Shalem et al., 2014). For the preliminary
consecutive screen, 2 3 108 A549-GeCKO library cells were infected with
VN04Low (H5N1) at MOI = 5 in infection media for 2 days. Surviving cells
were reseeded in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum
(FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (P/S) solution and subjected to four
more rounds of infection. The surviving resistant population was expanded
to 1 3 107 cells and subjected to deep sequencing analysis. For the
sequential screen, 2 3 108 A549-GeCKO library cells were infected with
VN04Low (H5N1) at MOI = 5 in infection media for 2 days in biological dupli-
cates, and the surviving cells were allowed to expand (�2–4 3 107). One-
fifth of the expanded cells were utilized for deep sequencing analysis,
and four-fifths of the expanded cells were subjected to the next round of
infection.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical significance was determined by two-tailed unpaired Student’s t test,
and p values %0.05 are considered significant and denoted with an asterisk.
Non-significant values are denoted as ns.
Additional experimental procedures are included in the Supplemental
Experimental Procedures.
