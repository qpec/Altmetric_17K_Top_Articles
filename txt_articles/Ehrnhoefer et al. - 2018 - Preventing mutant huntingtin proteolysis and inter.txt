Abstract
Huntington disease (HD) is caused by the expression of mutant huntingtin (mHTT) bearing a polyglutamine expansion. In
HD, mHTT accumulation is accompanied by a dysfunction in basal autophagy, which manifests as specific defects in cargo
loading during selective autophagy. Here we show that the expression of mHTT resistant to proteolysis at the caspase
cleavage site D586 (C6R mHTT) increases autophagy, which may be due to its increased binding to the autophagy
adapter p62. This is accompanied by faster degradation of C6R mHTT in vitro and a lack of mHTT accumulation the C6R
mouse model with age. These findings may explain the previously observed neuroprotective properties of C6R mHTT. As
the C6R mutation cannot be easily translated into a therapeutic approach, we show that a scheduled feeding paradigm is
sufficient to lower mHTT levels in YAC128 mice expressing cleavable mHTT. This is consistent with a previous model,
where the presence of cleavable mHTT impairs basal autophagy, while fasting-induced autophagy remains functional. In
HD, mHTT clearance and autophagy may become increasingly impaired as a function of age and disease stage, because
of gradually increased activity of mHTT-processing enzymes. Our findings imply that mHTT clearance could be enhanced
by a regulated dietary schedule that promotes autophagy.

Introduction
Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neuro-
degenerative disorder that is caused by an expansion of a
polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (HTT) protein [57].
Mutant HTT (mHTT) causes dysfunction in different cel-
lular compartments and pathways [13] that are difficult to
target individually. The removal of mHTT itself is therefore
an attractive therapeutic strategy and is currently being pur-
sued in both clinical and pre-clinical studies [61]. While
most of these studies aim to lower HTT RNA, changes in
mHTT protein levels through increased degradation have
also been shown to ameliorate HD symptoms [31, 59]. Both
soluble and aggregated forms of mHTT are thought to be
cleared preferentially through autophagy [47, 49], and both
mTOR-dependent and -independent autophagic pathways
have been implicated in its degradation [31, 48]. Interest-
ingly, a role for HTT in the regulation of autophagy has
recently been discovered [2, 34, 35, 43, 50]. Both the HTT
N- and C-termini play different but inter-dependent roles
in autophagy [43], which may be promoted by the inter-
action of the two halves after proteolysis [18]. However,
multiple proteolytic events may disrupt the interaction be-
tween the HTT N- and C-termini [18]. The cleavage of
mHTT in HD increases with disease progression and age,
and may prevent HTT from functioning as an autophagy-
promoting factor [21, 35].
Here we use the C6R mouse model, which expresses full-
length mHTT with a mutation preventing proteolysis at
amino acid 586 by caspases 6 and 8 [23, 62], to investigate

 the connection between mHTT cleavage and autophagy.
We demonstrate a general increase in autophagy in cells
and tissues from C6R mice compared to the YAC128
mouse model expressing fully cleavable full-length mHTT,
and show that this is accompanied by reduced accumula-
tion of mHTT protein.
HTT promotes autophagosome formation under basal,
but not fasting conditions [50], suggesting that dietary in-
terventions could circumvent mHTT-specific deficits in
autophagy. In agreement with this hypothesis, we demon-
strate that both fasting and scheduled feeding induce au-
tophagy in the brains of HD mouse models, although only
the longer scheduled feeding paradigm significantly re-
duces the levels of cleavable mHTT protein. These results
provide a potential molecular mechanism for the benefi-
cial effects of nutrient deprivation on neurodegenerative
diseases [15, 31, 38, 54] and demonstrate that autophagy
pathways that are not impacted by the HD pathology can
be harnessed to lower mHTT protein levels in vivo.
Results
The expression of C6R mHTT promotes autophagy
HTT can act as a scaffold mediating cargo loading in
basal autophagy [50], but as this function is dependent
on the HTT C-terminus, it could be lost in HD due to
proteolytic events [18, 35, 43]. To determine whether
the expression of cleavable or C6R mHTT alters autoph-
agy, we started by comparing mouse embryonic fibro-
blast (MEF) cultures derived from wt, YAC128 or C6R
mice. The autophagy protein LC3-II decorates autopha-
gosomes and is thus an indicator of autophagosome
abundance, while the autophagy adapter protein p62
provides a link between LC3 and cargo proteins and is
subsequently degraded together with the cargo [28].
Levels of these proteins are therefore commonly used to
assess the autophagic state of cells [28].
We found that baseline levels of p62 and LC3-II were
similar between MEFs of all three genotypes, while the
non-lipidated LC3-I was not detectable (Fig. 1a, higher in-
tensity blots shown in Additional file 1: Figure S1A). Using
bafilomycin, an inhibitor of autophagic flux, both p62 and
LC3-II levels increased, as expected, since their turnover
was blocked (Fig. 1a). However, the levels of p62 after bafi-
lomycin treatment were lower in YAC128 MEFs compared
to wt, while C6R MEFs showed no such deficit (Fig. 1a). At
the same time, no reduction in LC3-II turnover was ob-
served in bafilomycin-treated YAC128 MEFs by Western
blotting (Fig. 1a). To quantify the formation of autophago-
somes in more detail, we next analyzed the formation of
punctae immunopositive for p62 and LC3 by confocal mi-
croscopy. While no such punctae were observed under
basal conditions (Additional file 1: Figure S1B), treatment
with bafilomycin led to an increase in both p62- and LC3-
positive structures (Fig. 1b). Quantitative image analysis
revealed that both the density of p62- and LC3-punctae
was increased in cultures derived from C6R mice, whereas
MEFs expressing cleavable YAC128 mHTT showed a trend
towards a decrease compared to wt cultures in these mea-
sures (Fig. 1b), and were significantly different from C6R
cells. Interestingly, C6R MEFs show an increased number
of LC3 punctae density but lower LC3 signal intensity
within those punctae (Fig. 1b), indicating that the available
LC3 is distributed over a larger number of autophago-
somes. Accordingly, also the density of punctae with colo-
calization of p62 and LC3 was increased in C6R MEFs,
confirming their identity as autophagosomes (Fig. 1b).
In addition to its role as a cargo-binding protein in basal
and starvation-induced autophagy, p62 also associates
with misfolded proteins upon proteasomal inhibition and
proteotoxic stress [14, 32]. In this context, we found that
treatment with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 led to a
dramatic increase in p62-positive structures, which was
again exacerbated in MEFs expressing C6R but not cleav-
able mHTT (Fig. 1c). Proteasomal inhibition leads to an
accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, which are then
bound by p62 [29]. This can lead to a feedback loop of
transcriptional upregulation of p62 through Nrf2 [14]. In-
deed, we observed a strong upregulation of p62 mRNA
expression after MG132 treatment (Fig. 1d), which was
dampened in MEFs derived from YAC128 mice. Taken to-
gether, our data therefore suggest that cells derived from
C6R mice upregulate autophagic pathways more effi-
ciently than YAC128 cells, both at baseline and under
conditions of proteotoxic stress, a situation most relevant
to neurodegenerative diseases such as HD.
Interestingly, none of these measures were altered in
MEFs derived from YAC18 mice overexpressing wild-type
human HTT [24], suggesting that the changes in autop-
hagosome formation are related to the C6R mutation in
the mHTT protein, and not merely overexpression of a
non-pathogenic variant of HTT (Additional file 2:
Figure S2A + B).
Reduced interaction between mHTT and p62 is
normalized with the C6R mutation
To further investigate the role of mHTT in autophagy, we
next assessed its interaction with p62, and found that the
presence of the expanded polyglutamine tract significantly
reduced the binding efficiency of HTT1-1212 to p62 in co-
transfected cells (Fig. 2a). As p62-interaction domains
have only been described for the HTT C-terminus [43, 50]
which is absent in our expression construct, we next de-
cided to map this novel binding site. Using a series of
truncation mutants, we determined that HTT interacts
with p62 between amino acids 800-1004 (Fig. 2b), which
is an area known to harbour an ULK1 binding domain
and may therefore be involved in binding the ULK1/p62
complex during autophagosome formation [50].

 Furthermore, we found that C6R mHTT1-1212 interacts
approximately twice as strongly with p62 compared to
cleavable mHTT (Fig. 2c), which was confirmed with co-
immunoprecipitation of HTT with p62 (Additional file 3:
Figure S3A). Consistent with our findings for wt HTT
(Fig. 2b), the interaction between p62 and a mHTT1-586
fragment was also barely detectable, confirming that also
for mHTT the p62 interaction domain is located C-

 terminal of the D586 caspase cleavage site (Fig. 2c).
However, as the interaction is not completely abolished
for the mHTT-586aa fragment, HTT may have add-
itional p62 binding sites or multiple interaction domains
that can be separated by proteolysis.
Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the preferential
localization of C6R mHTT to p62-positive areas (Fig. 3a),
which was much reduced for cleavable mHTT or the
mHTT-586aa fragment. This colocalization may relate to
the role of HTT in autophagosome formation [43, 50], but
may also influence the autophagic clearance of HTT itself.
We therefore performed cycloheximide-chase experi-
ments in COS cells co-transfected with cleavable or C6R
mHTT1-1212 and p62. In the absence of p62 overexpres-
sion, cleavable mHTT is degraded more slowly than C6R
mHTT (Fig. 3b) within the first 4 h of chase time. How-
ever, when p62 is overexpressed, the degradation of cleav-
able mHTT is accelerated and rendered indistinguishable

 from C6R mHTT (Fig. 3b), suggesting that a sufficiently
large supply of p62 can overcome degradation deficits of
cleavable
mHTT.
Overexpressed
p62
was
almost
completely degraded within the 4 h timeframe of the ex-
periment (Fig. 3b, quantified in Additional file 3: Figure
S3B). We furthermore confirmed that the decrease in full-
length HTT and p62 levels are not due to proteolysis,
since no accumulation of degradation products was ob-
served on the full Western blots (shown in Additional file 4:
Figure S4C).
p62 interacts with ubiquitinated substrates, and prefer-
entially those that are linked to ubiquitin through lysine
63 (K63), promoting their autophagic degradation [4, 53].
HTT can be ubiquitinated by K63 or K48 linkages, and
both types of ubiquitinated mHTT accumulate in cell and
mouse models of HD, which has been attributed to im-
paired clearance by both autophagy and the proteasome
[6, 7]. Co-transfection of cleavable or C6R mHTT1-122
with either wt ubiquitin, or ubiquitin mutants that can
only bind their target proteins through lysine 48 (K48

 ubiquitin) or lysine 63 (K63 ubiquitin), revealed that C6R
mHTT co-immunoprecipitated with significantly more
ubiquitin in general (wt ubiquitin, Additional file 3: Figure
S3C). Interestingly, the interaction with K48 ubiquitin was
equal between cleavable and C6R mHTT, but K63
ubiquitin
preferentially
co-immunoprecipitated
with
C6R mHTT, indicating that the K63 linkage is preferred
in the presence of the C6R mutation (Additional file 3:
Figure
S3C).
Increased
K63-ubiquitination
of
C6R
mHTT would thus be expected to mediate increased
p62 binding and may therefore account for its preferen-
tial autophagic clearance.
Fasting-induced autophagy is functional in the presence
of mHTT
As a next step, we decided to investigate autophagy path-
ways in vivo. Since the liver heavily relies on autophagy to
maintain its basal function [33], and HD-specific dysfunc-
tion in autophagic and metabolic pathways has been
found in livers from HD mouse models and human pa-
tients [9, 36, 58, 59], we decided to focus on both brain
and liver tissues from YAC128 and C6R mice.
We first compared baseline levels of autophagy with a
food deprivation paradigm, which is expected to activate
autophagy [12]. A fasting period of 24 h was sufficient to
observe significant changes in hepatic levels of key au-
tophagy proteins in wt, YAC128 and C6R mice: fasting de-
creased p62 levels, in agreement with its increased
autophagic turnover following food deprivation (Fig. 4a)
[28]. Furthermore, LC3-II levels were increased by fasting
(Fig. 4b), indicating enhanced autophagosome formation.
Interestingly, LC3-I levels were strikingly elevated in C6R
mice under fed conditions (Fig. 4b). Fasting eliminated
this increase (Fig. 4b), suggesting that fasting leads to a
rapid conversion of available LC3-I pools into LC3-II. This
was further analyzed by qRT-PCR, which showed similar
expression levels of LC3 for mice of all three genotypes at
baseline (Additional file 5: Figure S5A), demonstrating
that the differences observed by Western blotting are
post-transcriptional.
To determine whether alterations in autophagy had an
impact on the degradation of mHTT, we next assessed
HTT protein levels in the liver of YAC128 and C6R mice.
We found a strong age-dependent increase in wt and
mHTT protein that reached statistical significance at
12 months in YAC128 animals (Fig. 4c). On the other hand,
C6R mice showed no age-dependent alterations in wt or
mHTT levels, suggesting that this change is specific to the
expression of cleavable mHTT (Fig. 4c). To confirm that
the changes are post-transcriptional, we performed qRT-
PCR analyses on liver tissues from 12 month old mice.
Interestingly, mHTT mRNA levels are higher in C6R com-
pared to YAC128 liver tissues (Additional file 5: Figure
S5B), confirming that the lack of mHTT accumulation
observed by Western blot are not due to decreased expres-
sion, but rather due to post-transcriptional effects such as
increased protein degradation.
Fasting-induced autophagy in the liver was paralleled
by a significant reduction of mHTT protein in YAC128
mice (Fig. 4d), while the levels of wt HTT remained un-
changed (Additional file 5: Figure S5C). mRNA levels of
the mHTT transgene were also not affected by fasting,
confirming that this intervention likely reduced mHTT
protein through autophagic degradation (Additional file
5: Figure S5D). Fasting also had an impact on hepatic
mHTT protein levels in C6R mice, although the reduc-
tion was more subtle in this genotype (Additional file 5:
Figure S5E). This is not surprising, given the already low
levels of mHTT protein in C6R compared to YAC128
mice. Nevertheless, the trend towards a further decrease
suggests that fasting-induced autophagy can still lower
mHTT even in C6R mice.
Taken together, these findings demonstrate that basal au-
tophagy is altered in the liver of C6R mice and may be
responsible for the lack of age-dependent mHTT accumula-
tion in this mouse model. Fasting-induced autophagy mech-
anisms on the other hand are intact and can be activated in
the liver of both YAC128 and C6R mice. Furthermore, our
data suggest that the age-dependent accumulation of mHTT
can be reversed by activating such protein degradation path-
ways simply through dietary changes.
Prolonged regulation of food intake induces mHTT
clearance in the brain
Recent studies have demonstrated that acute fasting also
induces autophagy in the CNS [1, 10]. We therefore ex-
amined LC3 and p62 levels in cortical tissues from
fasted as well as mice fed ad libitum, and found that a
24 h fasting period increased LC3-I, LC3-II and p62 pro-
tein levels in the cortex of both wt and YAC128 animals
(Additional file 6: Figure S6A). While both the increased
cortical p62 and LC3-I levels differ from our findings in
the liver (Fig. 4a and b), this may suggest different tim-
ing of autophagy induction in the two organs. These dif-
ferences not only manifest on the protein level, but are
also observed transcriptionally: While YAC128 mice
show a trend towards reduced p62 expression in both
the liver and the cortex at baseline (Additional file 6:
Figure S6B + C), fasting induces a reduction in p62
mRNA in the liver but not the cortex of wt animals
(Additional file 6: Figure S6B + C). Furthermore, unlike
hepatic mHTT (Fig. 4d), cortical mHTT levels remained
unaffected by a 24 h fasting period (Additional file 6:
Figure S6D). We therefore hypothesized that the lack of
mHTT degradation after acute fasting may be due to the
delayed induction of autophagy in the brain compared
to the liver, and designed a fasting schedule that could
be maintained for a longer period of time.
Ehrnhoefer et al. Acta Neuropathologica Communications  (2018) 6:16 
Page 6 of 16
 In our paradigm, mice were fasted for 18 h and
allowed full access to food for 6 h periods. We hypothe-
sized that this schedule would induce autophagy in vivo
daily, without necessarily reducing caloric intake. Long-
term caloric restriction has beneficial effects on aging
and neurodegenerative phenotypes [11, 42], and previous
studies have implicated both mTOR inhibition and
SIRT1 activation in these phenomena [11, 20, 25, 26].
Consistent with these reports, we observed that our
scheduled feeding diet decreased phosphorylated mTOR
(Fig. 5a), an indication of mTOR inhibition similar to
the effect of nutrient deprivation [64]. In addition, RNA
levels of SIRT1 were increased in mice subjected to
scheduled feeding (Fig. 5b), which can further contribute
to the downregulation of mTOR signaling [20] and thus
induce autophagy.
While the steady-state cortical p62 protein levels were
not altered by scheduled feeding (Additional file 7: Figure
S7A), we observed a significant induction of p62 expression
at the RNA level (Fig. 5c). This is consistent with the
Fig. 4 mHTT levels increase in aging YAC128 liver and can be reduced by fasting-induced autophagy. a, b + d 12 month old YAC128 and C6R mice, as
well as their wt littermates, were subjected to a 24 h fasting period, sacrificed immediately and liver samples were compared to littermates with ad libitum
access to food. p62 (a) and LC3 (b) protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. p62: 2way-ANOVA genotype p = 0.0103, fasting p < 0.0001, LC3-I:

 previously demonstrated replenishing of p62 protein levels
through increased expression during long-term fasting [5,
51]. Although LC3-I levels were not altered by scheduled
feeding (Additional file 7: Figure S7B), C6R mice responded
to the paradigm with significantly lower levels of LC3-II
compared to wt or YAC128 animals (Fig. 6a). Furthermore,
confocal microscopy demonstrated a strong reduction in
LC3 punctae in C6R mice at baseline, with levels that are
only reached after scheduled feeding in wt and YAC128
mice (Fig. 6b). Taken together, these data point towards
higher autophagic flux in the CNS of C6R mice, but also
suggest that it is possible to reach similar autophagy levels
in YAC128 animals through scheduled feeding.
Next, EM analysis was performed to quantify the
formation
of
autophagosomes
and
autophagolyso-
somes in the cortex of scheduled-fed mice. In this ex-
periment we observed predominantly autolysosomes
with electron-dense content with some remaining
ultrastructure [28], which are the most abundant form
of autophagic vesicles (AVs) in neurons [8]. We found
that the overall number of AVs per cell significantly
increased after scheduled feeding, confirming that
autophagosomes are successfully transported to the
neuronal soma and cargo degradation increased (Fig.
6c). Consistent with this data we found that the sched-
uled feeding paradigm also significantly reduced the
levels of cortical mHTT protein in YAC128 mice (Fig.
6d), similar to the effect of short-term fasting on
mHTT the liver (Fig. 4d). No changes were observed
for wt HTT protein (Additional file 7: Figure S7C) or
mHTT mRNA (Additional file 7: Figure S7D). Taken
together our data therefore suggests that scheduled
feeding
increases
mHTT
clearance
in
the
brain
through the upregulation of autophagy, and that this
mechanism is functional in a mouse model expressing
cleavable mHTT.

 Discussion
The expansion of the CAG tract in HTT is the single
cause for HD. Recent efforts in therapeutic development
have therefore focused on different strategies to lower
the levels of mHTT [61]. While a major focus of these
efforts lies on the reduction of mHTT expression, there
is strong evidence for dysfunction of mHTT clearance
pathways in HD [30]. In particular, impaired autophagy
has been linked to the well-documented accumulation of
mHTT in the CNS [30, 39].
Here, we show that the expression of mHTT resistant
to proteolytic cleavage at D586 (C6R mHTT) leads to
increased basal and proteotoxicity-induced autophagy in
primary MEFs. Together with the finding that autophagy
is normal in MEFs derived from mice overexpressing wt
HTT (YAC18), our data therefore suggest that the C6R
mutation in particular causes the observed alterations in
autophagy pathways. This may be due to an altered
structure of C6R compared to cleavable mHTT, since we
also find that C6R mHTT preferentially interacts with
p62 compared to the full-length form of cleavable
mHTT. As this interaction site localizes to an area also
bound by ULK1 [50], the aa800-1004 region of HTT
may form an ULK1/p62/HTT complex that can initiate
autophagosome formation [34, 35, 50]. At the same
time, the increased interaction may promote the autoph-
agic degradation of C6R mHTT itself. This mechanism
may explain why C6R mice fail to accumulate mHTT in

 the liver with age, despite sufficient expression levels
and in contrast to YAC128 animals. C6R mice are thus
better protected from the accumulation of toxic, aggre-
gated forms of mHTT compared to YAC128 animals,
which may shed light on the remarkable lack of HD phe-
notypes in the former mouse model [21, 23, 40, 45].
We only observe very subtle and specific deficits in au-
tophagy in MEFs derived from YAC128 mice: Western
blotting revealed a decrease in p62 turnover, with no def-
icit in LC3, while defects in autophagosome formation
monitored by immunofluorescence were also less pro-
nounced. However, the cargo recognition failure and spe-
cific defects in selective, but not bulk autophagy reported
previously for HD model systems [36, 50] may be related
to the decreased ability of mHTT to bind p62. This defect
may not only prevent the degradation of mHTT, but
through impaired formation of p62/ULK1/HTT com-
plexes could impact selective autophagy in general. Recent
studies have shown that the C-terminus of the HTT pro-
tein can act as a scaffold similar to Atg11, and promote
autophagosome formation [43]. This function is regulated
by an interaction between the HTT N- and C-termini
[43], which is disrupted in the case of multiple proteolytic
events within the HTT protein [18]. We therefore propose
a model in which the negative effects of mHTT N-
terminal fragments on autophagosome formation, trans-
port and fusion are repaired in C6R mice since mHTT
cleavage at D586 is prevented (Fig. 7). This furthermore
boosts the normal function of the intact HTT C-terminus
in promoting autophagosome formation and more effi-
cient degradation of mHTT itself (Fig. 7). Supporting this
hypothesis, increased autophagy and reduced mHTT
levels have been demonstrated previously in HD mouse
models crossed to a C6−/− line, an intervention that re-
duces (but does not completely abolish) mHTT cleavage
at D586 [19, 62].
Although the C6R mutation is beneficial, it is not directly
translatable to human HD patients. We therefore set out to
test a therapeutic intervention that has the potential to alter
autophagy pathways in vivo and to monitor its effects in
the presence of cleavable mHTT. Caloric restriction can
slow aging in a large variety of animal models [37] and up-
regulate key transcription factors such as SIRT1 that are
beneficial in different neurodegenerative conditions includ-
ing HD [11, 25, 26]. However, such an intervention is not
advisable for human patients, since HD already leads to a
significant reduction in body weight [3] which may be exac-
erbated by further caloric reduction. We show here that
scheduled feeding is sufficient to upregulate SIRT1 expres-
sion and activate the mTOR pathway in a mouse model of
HD. Importantly, intermittent fasting can still trigger
starvation-induced autophagy and mHTT clearance in the
YAC128 mouse model of HD, even though the overall cal-
orie intake was not restricted. Furthermore, subtle deficits
in autophagic pathways caused by the expression of cleav-
able mHTT did not prevent autophagy induction, suggest-
ing that any such defects can be overcome by strong
autophagy-inducing stimuli.
Circadian rhythms are disrupted in HD patients as well
as in animal models of the disease, and this phenotype can
be ameliorated by forcing a circadian pattern of food intake
in mice, even at late stages of the disease [38]. Since
Fig. 7 Schematic representation of the effects of cleavable or C6R mHTT on autophagy. mHTT is subject to proteolysis by different proteases,
with a number of cleavage sites clustering in the PEST2 domain [17]. Cleavage at D552 and D586 liberate a small fragment that is myristoylated
at G553 [34] and induces autophagosome formation. However, both the N-terminal and C-terminal fragments resulting from mHTT double
cleavage are toxic and interfere with autophagic cargo loading and autophagosome transport and fusion [18, 36, 43, 63]. In the C6R mice,
cleavage at D586 is prevented, and we observed enhanced autophagy as well as improved degradation of C6R mHTT. In both YAC128 and C6R
mice, autophagic flux and mHTT degradation can be enhanced in peripheral tissues by fasting and in the CNS by scheduled feeding

 autophagy follows a circadian pattern in the brain [1], it is
possible that the disruption of circadian rhythms in neuro-
degenerative disease may cause autophagic dysfunction and
contribute to the accumulation of autophagy substrates
such as mHTT. Furthermore, treating disruptions in circa-
dian rhythm through lifestyle changes may ameliorate
symptoms such as depression, anxiety and cognitive dys-
function in human HD patients [41], and our data suggest
that such an intervention has the potential to lower mHTT
protein levels through increased autophagy.
Conclusions
In this study, we provide evidence that not only pro-
longed fasting but also scheduled feeding without for-
cibly reducing calorie intake alters nutrient-sensing
pathways and activates autophagy in mouse brain. This
intervention furthermore reduces the amounts of mHTT
protein, and may thus contribute to its clearance. As
mHTT levels are closely correlated with pathology, these
findings therefore correlate environmental influences
with disease in a mouse model of HD.
In addition, we show that dysregulation of autophagy
caused by the expression of mHTT is not observed
when the protein is rendered resistant to cleavage at
D586 (C6R mHTT). Age-dependent accumulation of
mHTT is curtailed in C6R mice, and increased autoph-
agy observed in cells derived from this mouse model
may be responsible for the puzzling lack of HD pheno-
types in these animals [21, 23, 40, 45].
Materials and methods
Animal models and statistics
All mouse experiments were carried out in accordance
with protocols (Animal protocol A07-0106) approved by
the UBC Committee on Animal Care and the Canadian
Council on Animal Care. Mice are derived from in-house
breeding pairs, maintained under a 12 h light:12 h dark
cycle in a clean facility and given free access to food and
water except otherwise indicated (for fasting and sched-
uled feeding protocols). YAC128 (line HD53 [56]) and
C6R (line W13 [23]) mice are on a FVB/N background,
mixed sexes were analyzed. Cortex and liver tissue was
dissected and snap-frozen on dry ice for protein analyses.
Sample sizes were chosen based on extensive experience
with biochemical differences between YAC128 mice and
their WT littermates for experiments using mouse tissues
[21–23, 44, 46, 58, 62]. Cell culture experiments were re-
peated independently at least three times to ensure repro-
ducibility. Samples were only excluded if technical issues
were apparent (i.e. bubble on a Western blot) or if deter-
mined statistical outliers using Grubb’s outlier test (α =
0.05, no more than one sample per group was excluded).
For randomization, mice were assigned numbers not re-
lated to genotype. Scientists performing experiments were
blinded for genotypes, unless it was necessary to ensure
the appropriate order of samples on a gel. Data analyses
was performed by a separate person in possession of the
genotype information. For image analysis of electron mi-
croscopy and confocal microscopy data, unblinding was
performed after all quantitation was complete.
Statistical significance was assessed using Student’s t-
test for comparison of two groups, one-way ANOVA with
post-hoc Tukey’s correction for the comparison of one
variable between more than two groups, and two-way
ANOVA with post-hoc Bonferroni correction for the
comparison of two variables between groups. Variances
between groups were similar. All analyses were performed
using the GraphPad Prism 5.01 software package.
Generation of primary cell cultures
Primary MEF and neuronal cultures from YAC128 (line
53, [56]), YAC18 (line 212 [24]) and C6R (line W13,
[23]) embryos, as well as their wt littermates were set up
as described previously [16, 55]. In brief, embryos were
collected on day 15.5–16.5 of gestation for neuronal cul-
tures and at day 12.5 for MEF cultures. Tissues were ex-
tracted and transferred to Hibernate E (Invitrogen) for
up to 24 h, during which time samples from the
remaining embryonic tissues were genotyped [55]. For
MEFs, the body without head, limbs, liver, lung and
heart was minced, digested with 0.25% trypsin-EDTA
and taken up in MEF medium (Dulbeccos’s modified
Eagle medium with high glucose, 10% fetal calf serum,
2 mM L-Glutamine, 100 μM non-essential amino acids,
1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 μ M β-mercaptoethanol).
Cells were triturated with a pipette tip, digested with
DNAse I and a single cell suspension without clumps
was seeded. When indicated, cells were treated with
20 nM bafilomycin A1 (Cayman Chemicals) or DMSO
for 16 h. Cells were harvested by scraping and lysed for
Western blot analysis as described [16] or fixed for
immunofluorescence.
For neuronal cultures, cortices were micro-dissected in
ice-cold Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS+; Gibco),
then diced and pooled for each genotype. Cells were disso-
ciated with 0.05% trypsin-EDTA (Gibco), followed by
neutralization with 10% fetal calf serum in neuro basal
medium (NBM+) and DNAse I treatment (153 U/mL).
Tissue was triturated with a pipette five to six times. Cells
were plated on poly-D-lysine coated 6-well plates with
2 ml of Neurobasal media (Gibco #21103-049), B27
(Gibco #17504-044), 100 U/mLpenicillin-streptomycin
(PS) (Gibco), 0.5 mM L-glutamine and maintained at 37°
C, 5% CO2 with humidity. Cells were fed with 200 mL
fresh medium every fifth day. On day 9-11 in culture, cells
were treated with 10 nM bafilomycin A1 (Cayman Chemi-
cals) or DMSO for 2 h. Cells were harvested by scraping
and lysed for Western blot analysis as described [16].

 Western blotting
Western blots were performed on samples lysed in SDP
lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Igepal
with ‘Complete’ protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche)). Protein
concentration was measured using the DC protein assay kit
(Bio Rad, USA) and equal amounts were separated on 7%
Bis-Tris gels for the detection of HTT, or 4-12% gradient
gels (Invitrogen, USA) for the detection of LC3 and p62.
Protein was transferred to PVDF Immobilon-FL mem-
branes by electroblotting and membranes were developed
with primary antibodies in 5% bovine serum albumin/phos-
phate buffered saline. The following antibodies were used

and the LiCor Odyssey Infrared Imaging system were used
for detection. The following antibodies were used for im-
munocytochemistry experiments: anti-p62 from R&D Sys-
tems (MAB8028; 1:200), anti-LC3β from Cell Signaling

(A11011; 1:500).
Immunocytochemistry
Cells (MEFs or COS-7) were cultured on coverslips in 24-
well plates and treated with bafilomycin (16 h; 20 nM),
MG132 (4 h; 10 μM), or DMSO followed by fixation with
4%
paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room
temperature (RT). Cells were treated with ice-cold metha-
nol for 5 min at − 20 °C, washed 3× in PBS, permeabilized
in 0.03% Triton-X/PBS for 5 min at RT, washed 3× in PBS,
and incubated in blocking buffer (0.2% gelatin/PBS) at RT
for 30 min. Coverslips were transferred to primary antibody
solution made up in blocking buffer and incubated over-
night at 4 °C, followed by 3xPBS washes and incubation
with secondary antibody in blocking buffer at RT for 1.5 h.
Coverslips were washed and mounted on slides with Pro-
Long Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Molecular Probes).
Confocal imaging and image analysis
Single z-plane images were acquired on a Leica TCS SP8
confocal laser scanning microscope at 63X objective
magnification. Images were imported into Image J, back-
ground subtracted using a rolling ball radius of 15 pixels,
and de-speckled. 1-3 cells per image were analysed by
selecting 3 random regions of interest (ROIs) within the
cytosol of each cell, manually thresholding punctae from
each channel, and evaluating punctae size, density, and
overlap using the Image J Colocalization plugin and the
Analyse Particles function. All data were normalized to the
mean of the appropriate wild-type littermate control values.
For COS cell analysis, punctae analysis was not pos-
sible due to the diffuse staining pattern of transfected
HTT. Instead, 1-3 cells per image were outlined to gen-
erate ROIs, and the Coloc2 plugin was utilized to calcu-
late a Pearson correlation coefficient as measures of
colocalization between channels.
COS-7 cell transfection and immunoprecipitation
COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS, 1%
L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 0.1 mg/mL strepto-
mycin at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator.
HTT expression constructs aa1-1212 and 1-586 were de-
scribed previously [60], fragments aa1-800 and aa1-1004
were generated from HTT1-1212 15Q using the Q5 site-
directed mutagenesis kit (NEB) with the following primers:

sequencing.
Cells were transiently cotransfected with the aa1-1212
15Q, aa1-586 15Q, aa1-800 15Q, aa1-1004 15Q, aa1-1212

HTT constructs (11) together with RFP-p62 (obtained
from Addgene (12)) or HA-ubiquitin wt, K63 or K48 (ob-
tained from Addgene (13)). The Xtreme gene 9 transfec-
tion reagent (Roche Applied Science, Quebec, Canada)
was used according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The day after transfection, cells were treated with
100 nM bafilomycin for 4 h to prevent HTT-p62 and
HTT-ubiquitin complexes from degradation. Cell lysates
were prepared in SDP buffer and immunoprecipitated
over night at 4 °C using anti-p62 (MBL PM045) or anti-
HTT 2166 antibodies (Millipore MAB2166). Immuno-
precipitates and cell lysates were subjected to SDS-
PAGE and Western blot as described above.

ance of mHTT. 16 h later, 0 h timepoints were harvested
and 100 μg/ml cycloheximide were added for the indi-
cated timepoints. Samples were lysed and analyzed by
Western blotting as described above.
qRT-PCR
RNA was extracted using the PureLink mini RNA ex-
traction kit (Life Technologies). RNA was treated with
DNase I (Invitrogen) and 500 ng of RNA were reverse
transcribed using SuperScript III (Invitrogen) and oligo-
dT primers according to manufacturer’s instructions to
generate cDNA for qRT-PCR. The PCR was run with
SYBR Green Power master mix (Applied Biosystems) on
the ABI Prism 7500 Sequence Detection System.
Each sample was run in triplicate. Relative gene ex-
pression was determined by using the ΔΔCT method,
normalizing to Rpl13a mRNA levels in cortical tissues
and MEF cells and to Pgk1 mRNA levels in liver. The
following primers were used:

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
Mice were anesthetized with avertin and injected with
15 μL of heparin intracardially. Mice were perfused with
4%
paraformaldehyde
and
0.125%
glutaraldehyde
for
20 min at a rate of 6 mL/min. Brains were dissected and left
overnight in fixative at room temperature. 400 μm sections
were cut on a vibratome and 1 mm2 tissue blocks of motor
cortex were dissected. Postfixing, embedding, sectioning
and staining were performed at the University of British
Columbia BioImaging facility. Briefly, samples were rinsed
in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer and secondary fixed in
1% osmium tetroxide with 1.5% potassium ferricyanide in
0.1 M sodium cacodylate for 2 h. Tissue was washed two
times in distilled water and dehydrated in a series of etha-
nol dilutions, followed by graded resin infiltration and em-
bedding. Ultrathin sections were prepared on a Leica
Ultracut 7 using 45 degree diamond histoknife. Thin sec-
tions were counterstained with Sato’s lead. Images were
taken using a Hitachi H7600 Transmission Electron Micro-
scope and analyzed using Image J. 10-15 cells per mouse
were identified and pictures taken systematically around
the nucleus, covering all visible cytoplasm. 4-5 mice per
genotype from 2 to 4 separate litters of YAC and wt mice
were analyzed in a randomized and blinded fashion. AV
were identified as either autophagosomes with a double
membrane and visible cytoplasmic content such as mito-
chondria, or autolysosomes (vesicles with electron-dense
content and some remaining ultrastructure) [28] and
counted manually. The number of AV/cell was calculated
and normalized to wt littermates. Imaging and counting
were performed by separate blinded investigators.
Immunohistochemistry and image analysis
Samples from the same mouse brains as used in electron
microscopy were mounted on slides and stained with anti-
LC3b (1:1000) from Cell Signaling Technologies (2775).
Slides were imaged on a Leica SP5 laser-scanning confocal
microscope with a 63X immersion plan-apochromat ob-
jective. Fixed and stained mouse cortices were imaged at
100 Hz with a 1024 × 1024 pixel scan format, a zoom fac-
tor of 1 and a pinhole size of 75 μm. LC3 staining was im-
aged using the 543 laser at 15% laser power (50% intensity
and 100% gain) and DAPI was imaged using the UV laser
at full laser power (25% intensity and 10% gain).
Background subtraction on the LC3 image stack was per-
formed using the rolling ball method using a radius of 10
pixels. A threshold mask was then applied to the image
stack based on intensities ranging from 100 to 255 to gen-
erate binary images. Subsequently, ImageJ [52] automated
particle analysis was performed on the image stack and par-
ticle counts, size and area were measured for all images.

Pgk1. C - E 12 month old YAC128 and C6R mice as well as their wt litter-
mates were subjected to a 24h fasting period, sacrificed immediately and
liver samples were compared to littermates with ad libitum access to
food. C Protein levels for wt HTT were analyzed by Western blotting with
antibody MAB2166 in liver tissues derived from YAC128 mice. D mRNA
levels for transgenic human mHTT were analyzed by qRT-PCR in liver tis-
sues derived from YAC128 mice. E Protein levels for mHTT were analyzed
by Western blotting with antibody MAB2166 in liver tissues derived from
C6R mice. Representative blots and pooled quantification data with S.E.M.
are shown, the blot matching panel C is shown in Fig. 5d. Statistical sig-
nificance was determined by 1way-ANOVA (A) or two-tailed Student’s t-
test (B-E), number of replicates is shown as insets. (TIFF 1130 kb)
