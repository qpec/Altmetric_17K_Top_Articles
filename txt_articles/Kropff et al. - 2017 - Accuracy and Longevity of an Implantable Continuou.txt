Implantable Continuous Glucose
Sensor in the PRECISE Study: A
180-Day, Prospective, Multicenter,
Pivotal Trial
Diabetes Care 2017;40:63–68 | DOI: 10.2337/dc16-1525
OBJECTIVE
It is known that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can lower mean
glucose compared with episodic self-monitoring of blood glucose. Implantable
CGM systems may provide additional benefits.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
We studied the Eversense (Senseonics Inc.) implantable CGM sensor in 71 partic-
ipants aged 18 years and older with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in a 180-day
multinational, multicenter pivotal trial. Participants used the CGM system at
home and in the clinic. CGM accuracy was assessed during eight in-clinic visits
with the mean absolute relative difference (MARD) for venous reference glucose
values >4.2 mmol/L as the primary end point. Secondary end points included
Clarke Error Grid Analysis and alarm performance. The primary safety outcome
was device-related serious adverse events. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials
.gov, number NCT02154126.
RESULTS
The MARD value against reference glucose values >4.2 mmol/L was 11.1% (95% CI
10.5, 11.7). Clarke Error Grid Analysis showed 99.2% of samples in the clinically
acceptable error zones A and B. Eighty-one percent of hypoglycemic events were
detected by the CGM system within 30 min. No device-related serious adverse
events occurred during the study.
CONCLUSIONS
Our results indicate the safety and accuracy of this new type of implantable CGM
system and support it as an alternative for transcutaneous CGM.
People with diabetes frequently use fingerstick capillary glucose measurements to
guide their dosing decisions (1). Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems can
provide glucose data in real time and reduce the need for fingerstick testing (2).
Additionally, people with diabetes can receive temporal information, trend infor-
mation, and alarms for impending hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic events (2).
When used regularly, CGM can effectively lower mean glucose compared with
fingerstick glucose measurements only (3). Unfortunately, wear time of current
transcutaneous CGM is low in some populations, which might partially be explained

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND THERAPEUTICS
 by usability issues (4,5). The accuracy of
CGM systems has improved over the
years but could be improved further, es-
pecially in the hypoglycemic range (2).
Transcutaneous CGM systems consist
of a wired sensor containing glucose-
sensing enzymes, a transmitter, and a
display device. The wired sensor is
placed just below the skin in the subcu-
taneous fat and is continuous with the
transmitter base. The transmitter is
placed in the transmitter base and sends
data wirelessly to a display device such
as a dedicated receiver or a smartphone.
Several transcutaneous CGM systems
are currently on the market (6–8). Im-
plantable CGM systems may provide ad-
ditional ease of use over transcutaneous
CGM since frequent sensor insertions
through the skin are not needed and the
transmitter can be removed easily with-
out the need for sensor replacement, for
example during personal care. Further-
more, weekly sensor replacement with
warm-up time and the risk of damage to
the inserted sensor is no longer applica-
ble. However, the need for implantation
and removal through a minor surgical pro-
cedure imposes some discomfort on the
patient. Currently, no long-term data on
implanted sensor accuracy or longevity
are available.
In this multinational, multicenter Euro-
pean trial, we aimed to investigate the
safety and accuracy of a new type of CGM
system using an implantable glucose
sensor. In addition, we assessed sensor
lifetime, system wear time, participant-
reported outcome measures, and mea-
sures of glycemic control.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
Study Design and Participants
This was a 180-day, prospective, multi-
center, pivotal trial. The study was exe-
cuted between November 2014 and
November 2015 and performed at seven
clinical sites in Europe. Participants
were 18 years or older and had a clini-
cally confirmed diagnosis of type 1 or
type 2 diabetes for .1 year and used
insulin therapy. People were excluded
from study participation if they had
any of the following: a history of severe
hypoglycemia, diabetic ketoacidosis,
symptomatic coronary artery disease,
unstable angina, myocardial infarction,
or stroke in the past 6 months prior to
study; known severe microvascular
complications including proliferative
diabetic retinopathy, macular edema,
active nonproliferative retinopathy,
and renal failure; a hematocrit .50% or
,30%; lactation, pregnancy,orintending
to become pregnant during the course
of the study; or a condition likely to re-
quire MRI.
A study design diagram is given in
SupplementaryFig.1.Thestudy consisted
of 11 clinic visits: a screening visit, a sen-
sor insertion visit, five 24-h and three 8-h
device performance assessment visits,
and a sensor removal visit. Finally, a
follow-up visit was planned 2 weeks
after sensor removal. The study was per-
formed in accordance with the Declara-
tion of Helsinki and was approved by the
institutional ethics review board at each
site. Written and verbal informed consent
was given by all participants.
Procedures
During the screening visit, laboratory
measurements, a physical examination,
and an electrocardiogram were per-
formed. Participants received training
in the use of study devices, and written
instruction materials were provided. At
the sensor insertion visit, a glucose sen-
sor for continuous glucose measure-
ment was implanted in both upper
arms of the participant. Participants
were free to choose the exact location
of sensor implantation within the upper-
arm region. Participants decided which
of the two implanted sensors was to
be designated as the primary sensor.
Further information on the insertion
and removal procedure is given in
Supplementary Section 2. Participants
were asked to wear the transmitter
over the primary sensor and to perform
calibration twice daily using the study
self-monitoring of blood glucose device
(SMBG, Accu-Chek Aviva; Roche Diag-
nostics, Mannheim, Germany). The sec-
ondary sensor was used and calibrated
during the eight device performance as-
sessment visits only. Participants and
study personnel were display blinded
to CGM glucose values during the de-
vice performance assessment visits.
For the remainder of the study, contin-
uous glucose data were available to the
participants. Participants were asked to
confirm the CGM glucose reading using
the study SMBG device before making
treatment decisions. The maximum study
participation was 180 days depending on
end of sensor life, which was indicated
on the CGM display. The sensor was re-
placed if sensor functionality was found
to be lost due to electronics or mechan-
ical failure prior to visit 7 (study day 90).
Study visits started with a glucose
measurement ensuring that current
blood glucose was ,16.7 mmol/L or
300 mg/dL, and ketone blood content
#0.6 mmol/L. Safety laboratory tests
were performed according to local clinic
standard operating procedures. Body
temperature(99.5°For,37.5°C)was reg-
istered. If needed, visits were resched-
uled. During each study visit, venous
plasma samples were taken for determi-
nation of dexamethasone concentration
to investigate possible systemic absorp-
tion of dexamethasone used in the sensor
system. Thiswasdonein a highly sensitive
liquid chromatography–tandem mass
spectrometry method, with a lower limit
of detection of 2 ng/mL (9). Venous blood
samples were taken every 15 min ormore
frequently during episodes of hypoglyce-
mia (#4.4 mmol/L or 80 mg/dL reference
glucose) using an intravenous line in-
serted in the dorsal or cubital vein of
the participant’s arm. During night time
(2300–0700 h), samples were collected
every 2 h. After bedside centrifuge and
visual check for dilution and hemolysis,
venous plasma glucose samples were an-
alyzed using a YSI 2300 STAT PLUS glucose
and lactate analyzer (YSI, Yellow Springs,
OH). Samples were kept on ice and stored
in tubes containing dipotassium EDTA to
allow for re-analyses. Induction of hypo-
glycemia and hyperglycemia was per-
formed in a part of the participants per
decision of the site investigator (39 com-
pleted in 23 subjects). Finally, visits for
sensor removal and follow-up were per-
formed. Insertion and sensor removal sites
were inspected. Adverse events were reg-
istered throughout the study. Participants
were asked to complete questionnaires
at the start, after 90 days, and at the end
of the study.
The CGM system(Senseonics Inc.) used
in this study consisted of three compo-
nents: an implantable fluorescence-
based cylindrical glucose sensor sized
3 3 16 mm, a smart transmitter sized
40 3 40 3 14 mm, and a handheld de-
vice (iPod Touch; Apple, Inc., Cupertino,
CA) running a mobile medical applica-
tion. The transmitter had to be worn
over the implanted sensor for continu-
ous readout of glucose data but could
be removed and replaced without the

 need for sensor replacement. The trans-
mitter stored the glucose data and pro-
vided the participants with on-body
vibrations for notification of hypoglyce-
mia and hyperglycemia. Data were con-
tinuously transferred to the iPod per
secured low-energy Bluetooth trans-
mission, which allowed participants
and study staff to review current and
historical glucose data in real time. Fur-
ther product information can be found
in Supplementary Section 2.
Outcomes
Primary, secondary, and exploratory
outcomes were predefined in a statisti-
cal analysis plan; additional analyses
were added as indicated. The primary
efficacy end point was the mean abso-
lute relative difference (MARD) for ref-
erence glucose values .4.2 mmol/L
(75 mg/dL), defined as the average of
the absolute difference of paired CGM
system and YSI readings (reference) di-
vided by the YSI reading multiplied by
100 (10). The secondary efficacy end
points included Clarke Error Grid Analy-
ses and alarm performance. Alarm per-
formance was defined as confirmed and
missed event detection rates and true and
false alarm rates given for low and high
glucose alarm (,3.9 and .10 mmol/L
or ,70 and .180 mg/dL). Confirmed
event detection rate was defined as a
CGM measurement beyond the alarm
threshold within 30 min from the start
of the event, expressed as the percent-
age of total number of events. The true
alarm rate was defined as a CGM mea-
surement beyond the alarm threshold
confirmed by a YSI measurement within
30 min expressed as percentage of the
total number of alarms. The missed event
detection rate and false alarm rate were
defined as the inverse of the confirmed
event detection rate and true alarm rate,
respectively. Primary safety end point was
incidence of device-related or procedure-
related serious adverse events, and sec-
ondary safety end points included all
device-related or procedure-related ad-
verse events. Quality of life was assessed
using the Short Form Health Survey (SF-36)
and a device-specific questionnaire devel-
oped for the study. Exploratory outcomes
included sensor lifetime analyzed using
Kaplan-Meier analysis, calibration stabil-
ity, sensorstability, accuracy(MARD)over
sensor life, system lag time, within-subject
precision,andperson-to-personvariability.
Additional analyses included MARD over
the full glycemic range (2.2–22.0 mmol/L
or 40–400 mg/dL) and over the hypoglyce-
mic, normoglycemic, and hyperglycemic
ranges (#4.2, 4.2–10, and .10 mmol/L
or #75, 76–180, and .180 mg/dL), sys-
tem wear time, and glycemic control
assessed per HbA1c measurement at the
first and last study visit. Also, real-time
re-analyses of the raw study data using
a new data algorithm and analysis of
change in HbA1c over the study duration
based on HbA1c strata ,7.5 and $7.5%
(58 mmol/mol) were performed.
Statistical Analysis and Power
Calculation
An intent-to-treat analysis for the primary
efficacy analysis and additional outcome
measures was performed based on all
evaluable data from all participants with
at least one paired glucose reading. We
reported variables as mean with SD or
median with interquartile range (IQR)
where appropriate. CIs for the paired dif-
ference (D) between outcomes were com-
puted. All reported P values are two tailed,
and values ,0.05 were considered statisti-
cally significant. Sensor failures due to me-
chanical or electronical failure, for which
processes of improvements have been
implemented, were excluded from sen-
sor life analyses. The impact of a new
dataalgorithmonthesystemperformance
was assessed through re-analyses of the
raw study data.
Power calculation was based on a test
of superiority over a prespecified perfor-
mance goal of 20% MARD (reference glu-
cose values .4.2 mmol/L or .75 mg/dL),
with a conservative estimate of the inves-
tigational device performance of MARD
,18%, an SD of #14%, a power of 80%,
and a one-sided significance level of
0.0125. Considering within-subject corre-
lation, data distribution, expected drop-
out percentage of 20%, and inclusion of
up to seven training subjects, the total re-
quired number of participants was esti-
mated at 82. SAS 9.1, IBM/SPSS version
21, and Cytel version 10 were used for
statistical analyses. This trial is registered
with ClinicalTrials.gov, identification num-
ber NCT02154126.
RESULTS
Eighty-one participants were included,
of which five were used for platform and
procedure evaluation and five were desig-
nated for site training (further information
can be found in Supplementary Fig. 4). The
intent-to-treat analyses of the primary ef-
ficacy outcome included 71 patients. Par-
ticipant baseline characteristics are given
in Table 1.

 reference samples .4.2 mmol/L of
11.1% (95% CI 10.5, 11.7). Performance
of the CGM system in the hypoglycemic
range (#4.2 mmol/L or #75 mg/dL) was
less than the overall performance (2.2–
22.0 mmol/L or 40–400 mg/dL), 21.7 vs.
11.6% MARD (P , 0.001). A statistically
significant reduction of CGM accuracy oc-
curred in the last month of use (Table 2).
Table 3 provides further data on the accu-
racyoftheCGMsystemperglycemicrange.
Real-time re-analyses of the raw study data
using a new data algorithm indicated im-
proved performance over the currently
used algorithm (MARD 2.2–22.0 mmol/L
[40–400 mg/dL]; 10.5 vs. 11.6% [95% CI
of D 21.1, 20.9], P , 0.001; MARD
#4.2 mmol/L; 18.6 vs. 21.7% [95% CI
of D 23.8, 22.3], P , 0.001). Further in-
formation can be found in Supplementary
Table 6. A Kaplan-Meier analysis for sen-
sors survival estimated that 100, 82, and
40% of sensors were functional through
day 45, day 90, and day 180 in-clinic eval-
uation sessions, respectively (median sen-
sor life 149 days [IQR 97, 180]) (Fig. 1).
Twelve sensors were considered cen-
sored in the survival analysis due to either
subject withdrawing consent (n = 6) or
electronic or mechanical failure (n = 6),
and five sensors were replaced due to
electronic or mechanical failure within
3 months after study start.
HbA1c improved in the study group
from 7.54% (59 mmol/mol) at baseline
to 7.19% (55 mmol/mol) at end of study
(D 0.35% [4 mmol/mol] [95% CI D 20.55%
(6 mmol/mol), 20.21% (2 mmol/mol)];
P , 0.001). A post hoc analysis of par-
ticipants with a baseline HbA1c ,7.5%
(58 mmol/mol) showed unchanged
HbA1c at the last study visit (20.04%
[95% CI D 20.21, 0.14]; P = 0.669)
(20 mmol/mol [95% CI D 22, 2]),
whereas participants with a baseline
HbA1c $7.5% (58 mmol/mol) showed a
reduction of 20.66% (95% CI D 20.91,
20.42; P , 0.001) (27 mmol/mol [95%
CI D 210, 25]). The clinical performance
of the CGM system estimated per Clarke
Error Grid Analysis showed 99.2% of sam-
ples in the clinically acceptable error zones
A (84.3%) and B (14.9%) (Supplementary
Fig. 5). The in-clinic alarm performance
for the hypoglycemia (,3.9 mmol/L
or ,70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia
(.10 mmol/L or .180 mg/dL) threshold
indicated a confirmed detection rate of
81 and 88%, and an event true rate of
67 and 90%, respectively (Supplementary
Table 1). No indication for change in glu-
cose variability over time was found (data
not shown). Transmitter wear compliance
was a median 23.5 h per day (IQR 23.2,
23.7).
Quality of life measured per SF-36
questionnaire demonstrated unchanged
quality of life scores from baseline to end
of study. Results from a study-specific
questionnaire indicated high device
acceptance, with 84% rating “I would
want to be inserted with a sensor again”
and 90% rating “Using the system helped
minimize the burden of diabetes in my
life,” a score of 5 or higher (scoring range
1–7 points).
The primary safety outcome showed
no severe procedure- or device-related
serious adverse events. Fourteen device-
or procedure-related nonsevere adverse
events occurred in 11 out of 71 patients,
with a total number of 147 sensors im-
planted, used, and removed. Five cases
of skin reaction were recorded. In all
cases, therapy could be continued
after a temporary stop of 1–3 weeks.
Two cases of incision site infection oc-
curred, one patient received antibiotic
treatment and the other infection re-
solved without need for further medical
intervention. Four participants withdrew
consent because of study burden (n = 2)
and inability to obtain venous access
(n = 2), and two subjects withdrew con-
sent due to an adverse event thought
to be unrelated to the device. Implanta-
tion and removal of sensors was per-
formed by nonsurgically trained doctors
(endocrinologist/MDs) in most sites (five
out of seven), and the remaining sites
(two out of seven) used nonsurgically
trained doctors or surgeons depending on
daily availability. No level of dexametha-
sone was measured in any of the venous
samples. Further information on safety
and adverse events and nonprimary out-
comes can be found in Supplementary
Table 5.
CONCLUSIONS
The current study, investigating the ac-
curacy, longevity, and impact on the pa-
tient experience of a novel implantable
CGM system, showed safety and accu-
rate performance of the investigational
device over the full sensor life. Partici-
pant acceptance of the device was
high. The current system was accurate,
with an overall MARD of 11.1% for
samples .4.2 mmol/L (75 mg/dL). CGM
performance was less in the hypoglyce-
mic range, as is also seen with other
CGM products (7,8,11,12). A limited but
statistically significant reduction of CGM
measurement accuracy occurred in
the last month of use, possibly due to
long-term degradation of the glucose-
indicating gel before end of sensor life
was reached.
Device use coincided with a signifi-
cant reduction in HbA1c, consistent with
the results of a meta-analysis showing
that HbA1c lowering with CGM use
depends on baseline HbA1c and device
wear time (3). The Clarke Error Grid
Analysis estimated high clinical per-
formance, with 99.2% of samples in
the clinically acceptable error zones A
and B.
Results from questionnaire data indi-
cated high participant acceptance of the
system but did not register improved
perceived generic quality of life, as as-
sessed per SF-36 questionnaire. None-
theless study participants did describe
the ease of use, ability to remove the

 transmitter without removing the sen-
sor, and availability of on-body vibration
alerts as beneficial features of the sys-
tem. Participants used the CGM for
.23 h per day over the full study dura-
tion, indicating high acceptance of the
system. The implantation, use, and re-
moval of 147 glucose sensors in 71 par-
ticipants resulted in a limited number of
mild to moderate skin reactions and skin
infections, and no device- or procedure-
related serious adverse events were
reported.
A previous implantable glucose sensor
was described by Garg et al. (13). Al-
though the authors described accept-
able accuracy and longevity of this
approach, this CGM system was never
commercialized perhaps due to accept-
ability issues with the surgical implanta-
tion procedure related to the sensor size
(similar to an AA battery) (13). Other in-
vestigators have shown proof of concept
of an implantable self-powered CGM in
animals, but no human data are available
(14). Currently, no implantable glucose
sensors are on the market. On the basis
of the results of this study, the Eversense
implantable sensor received a CE mark on
10 May 2016.
The multicenter approach with real-
life use of the system at home and the
long duration of the study allowed for
assessment of glycemic outcomes, de-
vice acceptance, and impact on quality
of life on top of system performance. It
should be noted that these are uncon-
trolled observational data. As in most
studies testing novel diabetes technology,
itcan be expected that a moretechnology-
enthusiastic population was included in
the study. Also, participants with type 2
diabetes and participants of non-Caucasian
descent were underrepresented in this
study; as such, one should be careful to
directly translate the outcomes of the
current study to the wider population.
On the basis of mathematical models,
it was recently proposed that an inaccur-
acy of ,10% MARD is not expected to
lead to further improvements in clinical
outcomes of CGM use (2), although this
might be negated by future trials with
clinically relevant outcomes. This and com-
peting products are approaching the 10%
mark, except for the hypoglycemic range,
for which improvements are needed. Re-
sults from a real-time re-analysis of the
raw study data using a new data algo-
rithm indicated improved performance
over the currently used algorithm. The
CGM system including the new algorithm
is currently investigated in a 90-day U.S.
pivotal trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT02647905).
The results from this study indicate that
the use of a long-term implantable contin-
uous glucose sensor is both effective and
safe and provides specific usability bene-
fits. The results support implantable CGM
as a worthy alternative to current trans-
cutaneous CGM.
