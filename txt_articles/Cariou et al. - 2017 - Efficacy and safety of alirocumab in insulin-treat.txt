Aims. – The coadministration of alirocumab, a PCSK9 inhibitor for treatment of hypercholesterolaemia,
and insulin in diabetes mellitus (DM) requires further study. Described here is the rationale behind a
phase-IIIb study designed to characterize the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in insulin-treated
patients with type 1 (T1) or type 2 (T2) DM with hypercholesterolaemia and high cardiovascular (CV)
risk.
Methods. – ODYSSEY DM–INSULIN (NCT02585778) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
multicentre study that planned to enrol around 400 T2 and up to 100 T1 insulin-treated DM patients.
Participants had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels at screening � 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/
L) with stable maximum tolerated statin therapy or were statin-intolerant, and taking (or not) other
lipid-lowering therapy; they also had established CV disease or at least one additional CV risk factor.
Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to 24 weeks of alirocumab 75 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or a
placebo. Alirocumab-treated patients with LDL-C � 70 mg/dL at week 8 underwent a blinded dose
increase to 150 mg Q2W at week 12. Primary endpoints were the difference between treatment arms in
percentage change of calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24, and alirocumab safety.
Results. – This is an ongoing clinical trial, with 76 T1 and 441 T2 DM patients enrolled; results are
expected in mid-2017.
Conclusion. – The ODYSSEY DM–INSULIN study will provide information on the efficacy and safety of
alirocumab in insulin-treated individuals with T1 or T2 DM who are at high CV risk and have
hypercholesterolaemia not adequately controlled by the maximum tolerated statin therapy.

 Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in patients with type 1 (T1) or type 2 (T2) diabetes
mellitus (DM) [1–3], and insulin-treated patients have an even
higher CV risk [4]. Furthermore, the presence of comorbid DM
among those who have atherosclerotic CVD (ASCVD) significantly
increases the risk of CV events [4,5].
As in the general population, dyslipidaemia is a risk factor for
CVD in both T1DM and T2DM [2,6]. The development of
dyslipidaemia is associated with insulin resistance that precedes
the development of T2DM; once hyperglycaemia is present,
increased hepatic free fatty acid influx and synthesis, driven by
concomitant loss of insulin sensitivity and glycaemic control, cause
dyslipidaemia to deteriorate further [1,7]. Although T2DM is
usually characterized by elevated non-high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels, along with
low HDL-C, elevation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-
C) can be variable and rather modest [7]. Nonetheless, small, dense
LDL particles are increased, along with other qualitative lipid
changes: LDL is more likely to be glycated and oxidized, and HDL
undergoes increased catabolism [8]. As a result, two scenarios
probably contribute to increased CV risk in T2DM:
� increased TG levels result in increased levels of intermediate-
density lipoprotein (IDL) and very low-density lipoprotein
(VLDL) remnants, which are atherogenic [8];
� whether smaller LDL particles (LDL-P) are more atherogenic on
an individual level remains to be fully elucidated; however, a
shift to smaller LDL-P at any given level of LDL-C is associated
with a greater number of LDL particles and thereby an increased
atherogenic risk.
Patients with T1DM under good glycaemic control often have a
‘supernormal’ lipid profile, and subcutaneous administration of
insulin is known to increase lipoprotein lipase activity and, as a
consequence, the turnover of VLDL particles [5]. However, there
may be potentially atherogenic changes in the composition of both
HDL and LDL particles [5]. Recent evidence has also suggested that
components of metabolic syndrome (MetS) are often present in
adults with T1DM [9]. Under conditions of poor glycaemic control
or declining renal function, T1DM may also be accompanied by
dyslipidaemia with a lipid profile that resembles what is seen in
T2DM [1].
Several studies and meta-analyses have shown that lowering
LDL-C by statins has led to significant reductions in CV events in
those with DM [10–12], with further CV risk reduction associated
with
additional
LDL-C-lowering
by
concomitant
ezetimibe
[13].
Guidelines
generally
recommend
an
LDL-C
goal
of < 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L) and/or a reduction of � 50% from
baseline in patients with T1DM or T2DM considered to be at high
or very-high CV risk [5,14,15]. However, even with the currently
available treatments, many patients with DM continue to have
persistent lipid abnormalities [16–18] and are therefore exposed to
a residual risk of CV events.
Alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody to proprotein convertase
subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), is approved in several regions,
including the US, Europe and Japan, for the management of
patients with hypercholesterolaemia on maximum tolerated doses
of statin. In phase-III clinical studies, alirocumab reduced LDL-C by
up to 61% in patients treated with statins [19]. Significant
reductions in apolipoprotein (Apo) B, non-HDL-C and lipopro-
tein(a) [Lp(a)], trends for TG reduction, and modest increases in
HDL-C and ApoA-I were also observed. It is hoped that these robust
lipid changes will translate into significant reductions in CV events,
as the preliminary results were promising [19]. Indeed, the
ongoing ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study (NCT01663402) is evaluating
the effect of alirocumab on major CV events in � 18,000 patients
4–52 weeks post-acute coronary syndrome, including a significant
number with DM [20].
There is conflicting evidence regarding the possible association
of PCSK9 with alterations of glucose homoeostasis. The CODAM
study [21] found that plasma levels of PCSK9 do not differ between
those with recently diagnosed T2DM, normal glucose metabolism
and impaired glucose metabolism. In contrast, the ILLUMINATE
study [22] found that plasma PCSK9 levels were elevated in
patients with DM compared with those without DM, with a
significant association between PCSK9 levels and LDL-C, TGs,
glucose, insulin and homoeostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance (HOMA-IR) scores. In addition, a study evaluating the
impact of a short-term high-calorie, high-fructose diet showed
that plasma PCSK9 levels were increased with this diet indepen-
dently of cholesterol synthesis, and associated with insulin
resistance, hepatic steatosis and TG levels [23]. Thus, the potential
interaction between PCSK9 inhibitors and exogenously adminis-
tered insulin is of considerable interest.
Based on currently available data, there is no evidence of any
effect of alirocumab on glycaemia after a maximum follow-up of
78 weeks [24]. Nevertheless, despite no safety signals to date, the
safety of the coadministration of a biological agent (insulin) with a
monoclonal antibody (alirocumab) warrants further study. Of the
5296 participants in the phase-III ODYSSEY programme, around
one-third had DM, and 28% of those DM patients receiving
alirocumab were insulin-treated (8% of the overall alirocumab-
treated population). In these phase-III studies, 56% of the insulin-
treated patients received alirocumab at a starting dose of 150 mg
every 2 weeks (Q2W). However, as a 75 mg Q2W dose is expected
to be sufficient for most patients with DM, given their relatively
lower elevations in LDL-C, the present study is using a starting dose
of 75 mg Q2W, with an increase to 150 mg Q2W if LDL-C goals are
not achieved. Given the high CV risk in DM patients who require
insulin treatment, it is important to collect sufficient efficacy and
safety data for alirocumab in such patients to inform clinical
practice.
The present report describes the design of a placebo-controlled
study — ODYSSEY DM–INSULIN — initiated to further characterize
the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in insulin-treated patients
with T1DM or T2DM who are at high CV risk and have failed to
reach LDL-C goals despite maximum tolerated statin doses, with or
without other lipid-lowering therapy (LLT).
Material and methods
Study design
ODYSSEY
DM–INSULIN
(ClinicalTrials.gov
identifier:
NCT02585778) is a phase-IIIb randomized double-blind, place-
bo-controlled, parallel-group multicentre trial being conducted in
Europe and the US. It is evaluating the efficacy and safety of
alirocumab in insulin-treated DM patients at high CV risk with
hypercholesterolaemia not adequately controlled with the maxi-
mum tolerated LLT (Fig. 1). The study planned for a population of
approximately 500 subjects, comprising 400 with T2DM and up to
100 with T1DM. Randomization began in November 2015 and
ended in August 2016.
The study is being performed in accordance with the ethical
principles outlined at the 18th World Medical Assembly (WMA) in
Helsinki (1964), and all the relevant amendments laid down by the
WMA and International Conference on Harmonization guidelines
for Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Institutional review board or

and written informed consent was obtained from all study
participants.
Study population
The main inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1;
the full inclusion and exclusion criteria can be found in Appendix B
(see supplementary materials associated with this article online).
All eligible patients had insulin-treated T1DM or T2DM, and had
failed to reach their LDL-C goals [< 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L)]
despite taking stable maximum tolerated doses of statin with or
without other LLT. Participants also had established ASCVD
[including coronary heart disease (CHD), peripheral arterial
disease (PAD) and ischaemic stroke] and/or at least one additional
CV risk factor. The maximum tolerated dose of statin is the largest
registered dose/regimen tolerated by the patient, based on the
investigator’s judgment (see Appendix B for further details). Those
with documented statin intolerance (and so not taking statin
therapy) were also eligible for inclusion. Participants were
required to have been taking insulin therapy for at least 6 months,
with a stable regimen for the past 3 months; those who were
anticipated to require changes in insulin type, frequency or mode
of injection during the study period were excluded.
Study procedures
Patients were assessed for eligibility during a screening period
of up to 3 weeks, followed by randomization to one of two
treatment arms for a 24-week treatment period. After completing
the
treatment
period,
participants
enter
an
8-week
safety
observation period (Fig. 1). Participants must remain on a stable
diet for glucose and lipid management, and receive a stable dose/
regimen
of
statin
and/or
other
LLT
throughout
the
study.
Treatment for DM should be in accordance with local/regional
standards of care. On-site patient assessments are scheduled at
regular intervals between randomization (week 0) and weeks 8, 12,
20 and 24 (end-of-treatment visit) during the double-blind
treatment period, with additional phone calls scheduled for weeks
4 and 32.
Eligible patients were randomized to double-blind treatment at
a ratio of 2:1 (alirocumab:placebo), with stratification by DM type.
At randomization, treatment kit numbers were allocated according
to a centralized treatment allocation system (either an interactive
voice-response or web-response system, depending on the study
site). Study participants, principal investigators and study-site
personnel are blinded to all randomization assignments through-
out the duration of the study. To maintain the blind, all planned

 lipid analyses collected after randomization are masked. However,
for safety reasons, the investigators are made aware if TG levels
are � 500 mg/dL (5.65 mmol/L).
The study drug (alirocumab or placebo) is administered as a 1-
mL solution subcutaneously Q2W via a prefilled pen device. Those
randomized to alirocumab receive a starting dose of 75 mg Q2W
for 12 weeks, with a blinded dose increase to 150 mg Q2W at week
12 if, at the week 8 visit, LDL-C is � 70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L),
whereas
alirocumab-treated
patients
with
LDL-C < 70 mg/dL
(1.81 mmol/L) at week 8 continue with 75 mg Q2W until the
end of the treatment period. Those randomized to placebo remain
on
the
placebo throughout the
24-week treatment period,
although every participant receives a new study-drug supply at
the week 12 visit to maintain the blind. All participants continue to
receive a stable maximum tolerated statin dose (or no statin if
statin-intolerant) throughout the study.
Endpoints and assessments
The primary objectives of the study are:
� to demonstrate the superiority of alirocumab compared with a
placebo in the reduction of calculated LDL-C after 24 weeks of
treatment;
� to evaluate the safety and tolerability of alirocumab.
Study endpoints are summarized in Table 2. The primary
efficacy endpoint is the difference between treatment arms by
percentage change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to week 24,
using all values regardless of adherence [the intention-to-treat
(ITT) approach]. Safety is assessed throughout the study by reports
of adverse events (AEs), product complaints, laboratory analyses
and measurements of vital signs (Table 2 and Appendix C, see
supplementary materials associated with this article online).
Secondary efficacy endpoints include the effect of alirocumab vs
placebo on other lipid parameters at weeks 12 and 24 including, for
the first time in a phase-III study of alirocumab, the endpoints of
LDL-P number and size, and plasma ApoC-III concentrations.
Endpoints related to DM focus on changes from baseline in indices
of glucose homoeostasis (HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose), total
daily insulin dose and the number of glucose-lowering agents.
Treatment acceptability is assessed at weeks 8 and 24 in those who
self-inject, using a 22-item validated patient-reported Injection-
Treatment Acceptance Questionnaire (I-TAQ) [25]. Specifically, the
I-TAQ assesses four domains of treatment acceptability: perceived
efficacy (i.e. patient’s perception of whether the treatment is
working); acceptance of side effects; injection self-efficacy (i.e.
patient’s ability to perform the task); and injection convenience.
The I-TAQ also has three summarizing questions that measure
overall acceptability. Anti-alirocumab antibodies are measured at
the time of randomization and at weeks 12 and 24.
Statistical design and analysis
Sample size determination
A sample size of 69 participants (46 alirocumab, 23 placebo)
per strata (T1DM or T2DM) should provide 90% power to detect
a difference in a mean percentage change in LDL-C of 30%
between alirocumab and placebo, with a randomization ratio of
2:1 and a 0.05 two-sided significance level, assuming a common
standard deviation of 35%. However, to obtain even greater
power for the evaluation of safety as a co-primary endpoint, the
sample size was increased to around 500 participants (roughly
400 with T2DM and up to 100 with T1DM). Final sample sizes of
333 taking alirocumab and 167 taking placebo are expected to
provide an 80% power to detect AEs with an odds ratio for
alirocumab vs placebo equal to 3 for an incidence in the control
group � 5%.
Primary analyses
The primary efficacy analysis population is the ITT population,
defined as all of the randomized participants with a calculated LDL-
C value at baseline and at least one value within one of the analysis
windows up to week 24, regardless of treatment adherence.

 Separate analyses will be performed for patients with T1DM and
T2DM, with an overall analysis of all participants for some efficacy
endpoints.
The percentage change in calculated LDL-C from baseline to
week 24 will be analyzed using a mixed-effect model with
repeated measures (MMRM) approach to account for any missing
data, using all available post-baseline data within the analysis
windows (weeks 8–24). The model will also include fixed
categorical effects of treatment group, time point and treat-
ment-by-time
interaction,
as
well
as
the
continuous
fixed
covariates of baseline LDL-C value and baseline value-by-time
point interaction. Alirocumab will be compared with placebo, and
the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the difference calculated.
Safety analyses will be descriptive and based on the safety
population (all randomized participants receiving at least one dose
or part of a dose of the study treatment), and performed separately
overall and by DM type. The safety analysis will focus on the
treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) period, defined as the
time from the first double-blind dose to the last double-blind dose
of study treatment plus 70 days (10 weeks).
Secondary analyses
A hierarchical procedure (key secondary endpoints only) will be
used to control the type-I error and handle multiple endpoints. If
the primary efficacy endpoint analysis is significant at an alpha
level of 5%, then secondary endpoints will be tested sequentially in
the order in which they are presented in Table 2. Secondary
efficacy endpoints will be analyzed in the ITT and/or ‘on treatment’
(modified ITT [mITT]) population, defined as all randomized
participants who took at least one (or part) dose of double-blind
treatment, and had both baseline and at least one calculated LDL-C
value during the treatment-efficacy period (i.e. up to 21 days after
the last injection) within one of the analysis windows up to week
24.
Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated to have a normal
distribution will be analyzed using the same MMRM as for the
primary endpoint, with continuous fixed covariates of correspond-
ing baseline value and baseline value-by-time point interaction.
Continuous secondary endpoints anticipated to have a non-normal
distribution will be analyzed using a multiple imputation approach
for handling missing values followed by robust regression. Binary
secondary endpoints will be analyzed using a multiple imputation
approach
for
handling
missing
values
followed
by
logistic
regression. The Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare
changes from baseline between treatment groups by I-TAQ scores.
Anti-drug antibodies will be correlated with safety and efficacy
endpoints. Descriptive analyses will be performed for all DM-
related endpoints.
Results
Recruitment was completed in August 2016, and the clinical
trial is currently ongoing. In total, 517 participants have been
randomized from 10 countries (Austria, Belgium, France, Germany,
Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, UK and US) for a total
number of 76 patients with T1DM and 441 patients with T2DM.
Results of the 24-week treatment period are expected to be
available in mid-2017.
Discussion
Newly approved drugs, such as alirocumab, are likely to be
administered to patients with the highest CV risk, including those
with ASCVD and insulin-treated DM. Acquiring sufficient efficacy
and safety data for the DM subgroup is of considerable importance
to
inform
evidence-based
clinical
practice.
The
ODYSSEY
DM–INSULIN study has been designed specifically to investigate
the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in insulin-treated DM
patients at high CV risk whose LDL-C levels are inadequately
controlled despite maximum tolerated statin therapy. Findings
from this study will supplement the data available from a large
number of DM patients from the phase-III ODYSSEY clinical-
development programme, which showed that significant LDL-C
reductions and improvements in non-HDL-C, ApoB, Lp(a), HDL-C
and TG levels can be achieved with alirocumab irrespective of DM
status [26].
In addition to 440 insulin-treated participants with T2DM, the
study has recruited 77 patients with T1DM, whose inclusion is
important as randomized controlled data on LLT in such a
population are limited. Moreover, specific evaluations of safety
in those with T1DM and T2DM are important in the context of
concomitant insulin injections with a monoclonal antibody. A
pooled analysis of data from 3499 participants in five placebo-
controlled phase-III trials of alirocumab (COMBO I, FH I and II,
HIGH FH and LONG TERM) indicated that TEAEs arise overall at a
similar frequency to alirocumab in those with or without DM [26],
but only a relatively small proportion of these patients were taking
concomitant insulin.
In analyses of both pooled data and individual studies, fewer
injection-site reactions were reported in patients with than
without DM. This may be a consequence of patients with DM
being more accustomed to receiving injectable medications and/or
performing blood glucose monitoring. The present ongoing study
should provide more information on injection-site reactions in this
population, while also exploring treatment acceptability by
administration of the I-TAQ, a patient-reported outcome ques-
tionnaire specifically developed to investigate perspectives on
treatment with LLTs requiring subcutaneous injections [25]. Based
on previous data, most participants and physicians consider the
alirocumab prefilled pen easy to use, and patients have shown a
willingness to self-inject [27]. Furthermore, high rates of treatment
adherence (approximately 98%) were reported in phase-III studies
with alirocumab [19,28,29]. The ODYSSEY DM–INSULIN trial will
also provide useful information on the use of alirocumab in
subjects already familiar with self-injection, but for whom data are
limited regarding treatment with alirocumab from previous phase-
III studies.
The effect of alirocumab on LDL-P number and size is of interest,
as patients with T2DM are known to have a higher proportion of
small, dense LDL particles than people without DM [8]. Hypertri-
glyceridaemia, commonly seen in T2DM, leads to the preferential
formation of small, dense LDL by stimulation of cholesteryl ester
transfer protein. These small, dense LDL particles are more
susceptible to glycation or oxidation, decreasing their affinity
for the LDL receptor and, thus, contributing to reduced LDL
catabolism
[8].
Alirocumab
has
previously
been
shown
to
significantly
reduce
LDL-C,
LDL-P,
VLDL-P
and
chylomicron
concentrations in a phase-II study of patients with hypercholeste-
rolaemia (but without DM) on stable statin therapy [30].
Among other secondary lipid parameters, the percentage
change in plasma ApoC-III levels is also being examined. This is
the first time this endpoint has been incorporated into a phase-III
alirocumab trial. ApoC-III, an important regulator of TG levels,
has been shown to be an independent CV risk factor in patients
with DM [31]. ApoC-III genetic deficiencies are associated with
low TG levels and a reduced risk of CHD [32]. In a post-hoc
analysis of three phase-II trials, alirocumab reduced plasma
ApoC-III levels by 14.5–19.1% in patients with LDL-C � 100 mg/
dL (2.59 mmol/L) on stable statin therapy [33]. However, the
effect may be a consequence of increased clearance and/or
reduced production of VLDL particles rather than an impact on
ApoC-III synthesis.

 Understanding the impact of alirocumab on glycaemic control
is also of interest, particularly in light of the apparent increased risk
of DM associated with statin therapy [34,35]. In addition,
significant correlations between PCSK9 levels and glucose and
insulin levels, as well as the HOMA-IR, have recently been reported
[22]. Moreover, recombinant PCSK9 has been shown to regulate
expression of the LDL receptor in isolated pancreatic islets as well
as in the liver [36]. However, the function of PCSK9 in pancreatic
beta cells remains a matter of debate [37]. To further explore this,
glycaemic-related endpoints have been incorporated into the
design of ODYSSEY DM–INSULIN. It is notable that alirocumab had
no impact on glycaemia compared with either placebo or
ezetimibe in pooled analyses of patients without diabetes at
baseline from 10 phase-III ODYSSEY studies of up to 18 months’
duration [24].
Conclusion
The ODYSSEY DM–INSULIN trial is an investigation dedicated to
assessing the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in insulin-treated
patients with either T1DM or T2DM at high CV risk and with
hypercholesterolaemia not optimally managed despite maximum
tolerated statin therapy. In addition, a second study (ODYSSEY
DM–DYSLIPIDEMIA) will address the effects of alirocumab in
patients with T2DM and mixed dyslipidaemia. Together, the
findings of these two studies will provide valuable information on
the efficacy and safety of alirocumab in DM patients at high CV risk
to ultimately help to guide clinical decision-making beyond statin
therapy.
