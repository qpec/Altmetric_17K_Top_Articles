In Brief
Lenschow et al. used physiological and
anatomical mapping techniques to
uncover a large and robust genital
representation in a region of rat
somatosensory cortex previously
assigned as leg/forelimb cortex. Despite
the marked sexual dimorphism of rat
external genitals, anatomical cortical
maps of penis and clitoris showed a
stunning monomorphism.

SUMMARY
Mammalian external genitals show sexual dimor-
phism [1, 2] and can change size and shape upon
sexual arousal. Genitals feature prominently in the
oldest pieces of figural art [3] and phallic depictions
of penises informed psychoanalytic thought about
sexuality [4, 5]. Despite this longstanding interest,
the neural representations of genitals are still poorly
understood [6]. In somatosensory cortex specifically,
many studies did not detect any cortical representa-
tion of genitals [7–9]. Studies in humans debate
whether genitals are represented displaced below
the foot of the cortical body map [10–12] or whether
they are represented somatotopically [13–15]. We
wondered what a high-resolution mapping of genital
representations might tell us about the sexual differ-
entiation of the mammalian brain. We identified gen-
ital responses in rat somatosensory cortex in a
region previously assigned as arm/leg cortex. Genital
responses were more common in males than in fe-
males. Despite such response dimorphism, we
observed a stunning anatomical monomorphism of
cortical penis and clitoris input maps revealed by cy-
tochrome-oxidase-staining of cortical layer 4. Geni-
tal representations were somatotopic and bilaterally
symmetric, and their relative size increased markedly
during puberty. Size, shape, and erect posture give
the cortical penis representation a phallic appear-
ance pointing to a role in sexually aroused states.
Cortical genital neurons showed unusual multi-
body-part responses and sexually dimorphic recep-
tive
fields.
Specifically,
genital
neurons
were
co-activated by distant body regions, which are
touched during mounting in the respective sex. Gen-
ital maps indicate a deep homology of penis and
clitoris representations in line with a fundamentally
bi-sexual layout [16] of the vertebrate brain.
RESULTS
Rat external genitals were sexually dimorphic. Scrotum and
vulva were only present in males (Figure 1A) and females
(Figure 1B), respectively. The penis and external clitoris had a
similar shape but show a several-fold size difference (right
panels in Figures 1A and 1B).
For high-resolution mapping of genital cortex, we combined
physiological and anatomical histochemistry-based analysis.
Anatomical cytochrome-oxidase maps are much clearer in
young animals [17]. Hence, we focused our initial experiments
on young prepubescent animals. For physiological mapping of
posterior rat somatosensory cortex, we assessed tactile recep-
tive fields of multi-unit and in rare cases also single-unit
responses at 377 penetration sites in six male and five female
prepubescent rats. To plot receptive fields, we inserted a
recording pipette at a depth ranging from deep cortical layer 3
to upper layer 5. For neural recordings, signals were filtered for
spikes and sent to an audio-monitor, while palpating the animal’s
body surface. These procedures typically resulted in multi-unit
recordings, but in a small fraction of cases (�10%) we also
encountered isolated single-unit responses.
A male map is shown in Figure 1C. Genital responses were
observed in an area around 2.5 mm lateral and 2.5 mm posterior
from bregma. A similar location of genital responses was seen in
a female animal (Figure 1D). Pure genital responses (black) were
rare, and in most instances genital responses overlapped with
responses to different body parts (striped in Figures 1C and 1D).
When averaging individual response maps by sex, we found
the strongest genital responses in males for palpation of the
scrotum at 2.5 mm posterior and 2 mm lateral from bregma
(Figure S1A). In females, we found the strongest response
2.5 mm posterior and 2.5 mm lateral from bregma, correspond-
ing to the vulva (Figure S1B). Interestingly, in males, we detected
another site of strong genital responses at 1.5 mm posterior and
106

 3.5 lateral from bregma, where we mainly observed responses to
penis palpation (Figure S1A). The clitoris had no well-defined
best average site of responsiveness. In individual experiments,
however, clitoris responses were observed anterior and lateral
from vulva responsive sites. As already noted, the genitals
were rarely the sole responsive area. In particular, there was
often overlap with the cortical regions receptive to the forelimb
and the trunk as coarsely outlined in the schematics of male
and female somatotopy (Figures 1E and 1F). We found that
males show a significantly higher fraction of genital responses
�28% (55 out of 194 sites) than females, which showed genital
responses only at �16% (30 out of 183 sites, p = 0.007, Fisher’s
exact test).
After receptive field mapping, we obtained detailed anatom-
ical maps of layer 4 in tangential sections through the somato-
sensory cortex. To this end, we performed cytochrome oxidase
staining, which reveals granular layer 4 regions (by a dark precip-
itate, Figures 2A and 2B). Granular zones of sensory cortex are
characterized by numerous layer 4 granule cells and receive
massive thalamic inputs. These histochemically delineated
maps were vivid and much more detailed than any physiological
mapping result. We identified the genital representation in these
anatomical maps by three approaches. (1) We placed lesions at
sites responsive to genitals (n = 2, one penis response lesion,

one clitoris response lesion). (2) We
matched individual physiological maps
to the overall layout of individual anatom-
ical maps and then asked which part of
the anatomical map corresponds to the
genital (n = 10). To this end, we identified
four landmarks (hindpaw, forepaw, trunk,
and unresponsive zone posterior to the trunk), which could be
easily identified in physiological maps and anatomical maps.
Once we achieved an optimal alignment of these landmarks,
we asked which part of the anatomical map corresponded to
the genital responses. (3) For hemispheres (n = 17), where
we did not obtain physiological mapping data, we used the
same procedure to match anatomical maps to our overall
physiological
maps
(Figures
1E
and
1F)
and
published
response maps [7–9]. All three methods led to the same con-
clusions, as depicted in Figures 2C and 2D. The anatomical
maps of male (Figures 2A and 2C) and female (Figures 2B
and 2D) genitals allowed two striking observations. First,
cortical male penis and female clitoris were very similar; i.e.,
genital
maps
were
sexually
monomorphic.
Second,
the
anatomical penis map looked different from unlike the flaccid
(resting) penis (Figure 1A, left), which was small, pointing
downward, and aligned to the scrotum. Instead, size, shape,
and erect posture give the cortical penis map a phallic appear-
ance. We noted a substantial individual variability of cortical
genital representations but found them to be bilaterally sym-
metric both in males (Figure 2E) and females (Figure 2F). We
measured the area of various somatosensory areas by outlining
the anatomical regions of interest (n = 11 male and n = female
hemispheres). These measurements confirmed the quantitative

107
 similarity of cortical penis, and clitoris representation with
respect to area (Figure 2G), and cortical genital length (Fig-
ure 2H). Our detailed measurements included shaft length
(from the tip of the genital representation to its base), width
(width half way from the base), and the length from the tip to
the back of the trunk (total genital length, which includes
scrotum and vulva representations, respectively). All measure-
ments confirmed sexual monomorphism.
As previous mapping studies did not report genital responses
in rat somatosensory cortex, we wanted to confirm the presence
of such responses by more objective method than the mere hand
mapping of receptive fields. To this end, we obtained in vivo
whole-cell recordings (n = 10) at the coordinates identified as
genital cortex by mapping experiments and applied air-puff
stimuli to the genitals. As shown in Figure S2, we observed
huge (up to 25 mV average) postsynaptic responses to genital
stimulation in such recordings. Within the genital region, we often
observed marked response differences (compare the scrotum
response in Figure S2A to the penis response Figure S2B), indi-
cating relatively small receptive fields within the genital region.
Taken together, the analysis of postsynaptic responses corrob-
orated the presence of a genital representation in rat somatosen-
sory cortex.
While anatomical genital maps were surprisingly sexually
monomorphic, close inspection of cortical genital receptive
fields revealed sex differences. Both male (Figure 3A) and female
(Figure 3B) genital responses were rarely observed in isolation
and co-localized with other body parts (Figures 3A–3C). We

 mapped 55 genital receptive fields in the males and found that 13
of these receptive fields included genitals and forearm/forepaw/
shoulder. In females, we identified 30 genital receptive fields and
only two fields co-localized with the forearm. Thus, the fraction of
forelimb/genital receptive fields is significantly smaller in females
(Fisher’s exact test, Figure 3C). In females, many genital recep-
tive fields showed co-localization with the trunk (15 out of 30),
whereas such co-localization was rare in males (seven out of
55). This difference was significant (Figures 3A–3C, Fisher’s
exact test). We were concerned that the unusual multi-body-part
response could be an artifact of the mixing of single-body-part
responses of different cells in our multi-unit recordings. There-
fore, we performed single-unit recordings in genital cortex
(n = 24 cells in males and n = 24 cells in females). In both sexes,
a majority of cells increased their firing rate after genital air puffs,
but many single units responded sparsely. We found that single
genital neurons responded to multiple body parts (Figure 3D,
upper). In pooled responses of those cells that showed at least
some (R0.2 Hz) ongoing activity (Figure 3D, lower), forearm-
genital combinations were more common in males than in fe-
males (Figure 3E, upper and lower), as observed before for
multi-unit responses. On the other hand, trunk-genital combina-
tions were seen more often in female single neuron responses
(data not shown).
The data presented so far referred to young prepubescent
animals. As genitals do not acquire their full functionality until

 adulthood, we wondered whether genital maps change in older
animals. As expected [17], adult cytochrome oxidase maps
were less clearly delineated (Figures S3A and S3B) but had qual-
itatively the same layout as in young animals (Figures S3C and
S3D). Most interestingly, however, we observed a massive size
increase of genital cortex during puberty (Figure 4A). While the
overall size of somatosensory cortex increased only modestly
(+14%) between �P25 animals and animals P42 and older
(Figures 4A and 4B), the clitoris and the penis representation
both roughly doubled in size (Figures 4A and 4C). The hindpaw
representation also increased in relative size (Figure 4D),
whereas the forelimb representation did not change much in pu-
berty (Figure 4E). To assess relative growth, we normalized for
each hemisphere and each body part the size of adult represen-
tations by dividing it by the average size of this body part in maps

from young animals. We found that there
was a significant difference in relative
growth between body parts (ANOVA,
p < 0.05). We then used unpaired t tests
to compare the growth of genital cortex
(penis
and
clitoris
representation)
to
growth of other body parts. We found
that genital cortex grows significantly
more than the entire S1, the trunk, and the forepaw (two-tailed
t test, p < 0.05). In contrast, genital cortex did not grow signifi-
cantly more than hindpaw cortex (two-tailed t test, p = 0.06).
The size increase of the genital representation during puberty
was the same in both sexes. Thus, the mean relative size of
clitoris and penis representation was almost exactly the same
between adults of both sexes (1.73% versus 1.71% of somato-
sensory cortex in males versus females). Given the marked
expansion of the cortical genital representation in puberty, we
wondered how genitals change in puberty. In line with previous
studies [18], we observed a substantial length increase in the
penis (almost a doubling of penis length) but only a minor
(10%–20%) length increase of the clitoris in puberty. Thus, the
cortical
monomorphism
of
genital
representation
persists
through puberty despite increasing external sexual dimorphism.

 DISCUSSION
Physiological and anatomical mapping techniques revealed a
large and robust genital representation in a region of rat somato-
sensory cortex previously assigned as leg/forelimb cortex [7–9].
This discrepancy with earlier work might stem from: (1) a lack of
focus on genitals previously, (2) the fact that genitals are poorly
accessible for mapping (because of their very posterior, ventral,
and partially internal position), (3) the unusual overlap of genital
receptive fields with other body parts, which can obscure genital
responses, (4) the use of adult animals in previous mapping
work, which complicates cytochrome-oxidase based anatomy.
We detected a number of sex differences in genital cortex. The
young, prepubescent male rats studied here showed a larger
fraction of genital responses than prepubescent female rats. In
light of the pronounced growth of genital cortex during puberty,
it would be worthwhile to reinvestigate cortical responses in
adult animals and in different sexual states (i.e., estrus versus
nonestrus). Earlier work in cats and rats indicated a modulation
of genital sensory responses by estrus [19, 20], and other find-
ings suggest a differential processing of sexual information
through stages of the estrus cycle. Different from males, females
show cyclic peaks in sexual desire and excitability around the
time of ovulation [21]. Modulation of cortical representation by
maternity has been documented in somatosensory cortex [22]
and auditory cortex [23–25]. Whether genital cortex responses
are cycling with the sexual state of females, as it was shown in
the ventromedial hypothalamus of mice [26], needs to be
explored in recordings in awake animals.
Receptive field structure was sexually dimorphic in the genital
cortex. In males, genital responses often combined with forelimb
responses, while in females we found genital and trunk compos-
ite receptive fields. Such multi-body-part receptive fields are
quite rare in other parts of somatosensory cortex. Male fore-
limb/genital fields might be explained by the extension of the
cortical penis representation to the forelimb in the body map,
but this explanation cannot account for the absence of such
fields in females. Such sexually dimorphic receptive fields might
reflect a sexual function: the body parts co-represented with
genitalia are those parts contacted in males and females during
mounting.
We discovered monomorphic anatomical maps of penis and
clitoris in layer 4 of the somatosensory cortex. Mapping by cyto-
chrome oxidase histochemistry offers a much higher (�5 mm
versus several 100 mm) resolution than previous physiological
maps. The vivid body and genital maps provide clear evidence
for a somatotopic genital representation [13–15]. Anatomical
cortical genital maps are remarkable for five reasons. First,
such high-resolution maps allow precise delineation of cortical
genital maps rather than a mere ‘‘symbolic’’ genital illustration
[11, 14]. Second, size, shape, and erect posture give the cortical
penis representation a phallic appearance pointing to a role of
genital cortex in sexually aroused states. Hence, the illustration
of genital sensations by a non-erect penis in Penfield and Ras-
mussen [11] and Kell et al. [14] is likely to be incorrect. We also
visualized a phallic clitoris representation, which is interesting
in the context of lesbian female phallus proposals [27]. Third,
the growth of genital cortex in puberty is a highly unusual devel-
opmental pattern, because (1) of its magnitude, which exceeds
the growth of somatosensory cortex in the entire postnatal life
[28], (2) it alters layer 4 input maps, which usually become immu-
table shortly after birth [29, 30], and (3) it occurs so late in post-
natal development. Such findings point to potential neural
substrates of the marked changes in sexual behavior during pu-
berty and indicate that there is not a single critical period for the
entire somatosensory cortex. Fourth, the identification of cortical
genital maps opens up new avenues for the study of sexuality,
much like the discovery of an anatomical barrel map [31] inspired
studies on the whisker system [32, 33]. Similarly, cortical genital
maps should be instrumental in delineating cortical sexual infor-
mation flow, which can now be approached by determining the
connectivity of genital cortex. Bilaterally symmetric genital
maps contrast with evidence from stroke patients for right hemi-
spheric sexual lateralization [34], a discrepancy that deserves
further attention. Fifth, these maps reveal a cortical monomor-
phism of penis and clitoris representation. Such monomorphism
is entirely unexpected in light of the marked external genital
dimorphism. In line with genital dimorphism, some authors
observed an innervation of male genitals by more afferents [35]
or at least by larger afferents [36] than in females. This puzzling
monomorphism might be related to the common developmental
origin of penis and clitoris from the genital tubercle.
Conclusion
Combined physiological and anatomical mapping of genital
representations
results
in
high-resolution
cortical
genital
maps. Such maps are much different from previous work,
which identified the putative cortical location of genital sensa-
tions
but
represented
cortical
genitals
only
symbolically
[10, 11, 14]. The striking map monomorphism of cortical genital
representations might be best understood in the context of
developmental [37], neurogenetic [38], and comparative work
argued against a purely genetic sexual determination of the
vertebrate brain. In particular, neuro-endocrinological analysis
of pseudo-sexual parthenogenetic lizards suggested that sex
hormones impose sexual identity on a sexually plastic brain
with bi-sexual potential [16]. Thus, we argue that monomorphic
genital maps reflect the fundamentally bi-sexual layout of the
vertebrate brain.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
For details, please see the Supplemental Experimental Procedures. All exper-
imental procedures were performed according to German and American reg-
ulations on animal welfare and were approved by ethics committees in Berlin,
Germany, and Woods Hole, MA, respectively. Long-Evans rats were provided
by the Marine Biological Institute, Woods Hole. Prepubescent animals for his-
tological and physiological mapping were aged between post-natal day (P) 23
and P30. Adult animals for histological analysis were between 6 weeks and 1
year old. Long-Evans rats (P22–P30, n = 11, six males and five females) were
anesthetized using urethane (1.4 g/kg, i.p.). An approximately 5 3 5 mm sized
craniotomy was made 5 mm posterior to and 5 mm lateral to bregma. At each
recording site, we searched for clear tactile responses at a depth between
deeper layer 3 (600 mm) to upper layer 5 (1,300 mm) and plotted receptive fields.
Receptive fields plotted by systematically palpating the animal’s body surface
including the internal parts of the vulva/clitoris in females. For single-unit re-
cordings, we used 5-MU glass pipettes and recorded large (>0.5 mV) spikes
of individual cells in the juxtacellular configuration. After physiological map-
ping, animals received an overdose of the anesthetic (20% urethane solution)
and were perfused with phosphate buffer followed by a 4% paraformaldehyde

 (PFA) solution. Brains were removed, hemispheres were separated, and
cortices were flattened between two glass slides separated by clay spacers.
Sections were stained for cytochromeoxidase activity using the protocol of
Wong-Riley [39]. Subsequently, granular somatosensory regions (indicated
by a dark precipitate from the cytochrome oxidase stain) were drawn with Im-
ageJ software. The area of various somatosensory regions was outlined and
measured by the ImageJ area calculating tool (see Figure 2C). The anatomical
maps were matched to the physiological mapping as follows: (1) individual
recording sites were matched to anatomical map locations by placing electro-
lytic lesions, and lesions were placed by injecting 10 mA negative current
through a tungsten electrode for 10 s; (2) individual physiological maps were
matched to the overall layout of individual anatomical maps (n = 10); and (3)
anatomical maps (n = 17 hemispheres/maps from young animals and n = 9
hemispheres/maps from adult animals) were matched to our overall maps
(Figures 1E and 1F) and published maps [7–9].
