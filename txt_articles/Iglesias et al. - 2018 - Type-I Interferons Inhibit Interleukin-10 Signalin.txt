Destruction of insulin-producing β-cells by autoreactive T lymphocytes leads to the 
development of type 1 diabetes. Type-I interferons (TI-IFN) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) have 
been connected with the pathophysiology of this disease; however, their interplay in the 
modulation of diabetogenic T cells remains unknown. We have discovered that TI-IFN 
cause a selective inhibition of IL-10 signaling in effector and regulatory T cells, altering 
their responses. This correlates with diabetes development in nonobese diabetic mice, 
where the inhibition is also spatially localized to T cells of pancreatic and mesenteric 
lymph nodes. IL-10 signaling inhibition is reversible and can be restored via blockade 
of TI-IFN/IFN-R interaction, paralleling with the resulting delay in diabetes onset and 
reduced severity. Overall, we propose a novel molecular link between TI-IFN and IL-10 
signaling that helps better understand the complex dynamics of autoimmune diabetes 
development and reveals new strategies of intervention.

Type 1 diabetes is a complex autoimmune disease characterized by the progressive destruction of 
the insulin-producing β-cells in the pancreas by autoreactive T lymphocytes (1). It is caused by a 
combination of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. In the past decade, viral infections 
and the composition of the gut microbiota have gained increasing attention as environmental factors 
that contribute to the initiation of the disease (2–4) but the mechanisms by which these factors 
contribute to the activity of diabetogenic T cells remains unknown. It is clear that CD4 T cells are 
of chief importance in this disease. Nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, a widely used model of human 
disease that spontaneously develop diabetes, are protected from the disease onset when deficient in 
CD4 T cells (5, 6), and enriched CD4+ cells from diabetic donors are able to transfer the disease when 
administered into NOD-scid/scid recipients (7). However, the connection between environment and 
the activity of diabetogenic T cells remains elusive.

TI-IFNs, IL-10, and Diabetes

Multiple clinical and experimental observations point toward 
type-I interferons (TI-IFNs), essential cytokines for the clearance 
of viruses, as the mediators that drive a pre-diabetic or suscep-
tible individual toward type 1 diabetes (8). Relevant examples 
include high levels of IFN-α detected in the pancreas of diabetic 
patients (9), absence of autoantibodies able to neutralize IFN-α 
in the subset of AIRE-deficient (APS1) patients who developed 
diabetes (10), induction of diabetes in non-autoimmune prone 
C57BL/6 mice by overexpression of IFN-α in β-cells (11), accu-
mulation of high levels of TI-IFN in NOD mice (12), and delay 
of disease onset (and decreased incidence) with early blockade 
of TI-IFN receptor signaling (13). More recently, Ferreira and 
colleagues reported that an IFN signature in PBMC of geneti-
cally predisposed children was detectable before the appearance 
of islet-specific autoantibodies (14). Despite these observations, 
the mechanism(s) through which TI-IFN promotes T1D remains 
poorly understood.
The cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10) has an essential role in the 
development of autoimmune pathologies (15). Previous studies 
suggested that the low expression of this cytokine in the pancreas 
mediates the occurrence of diabetes (16) and decreased IL-10 levels 
in serum of newly diagnosed children with type 1 diabetes has been 
observed (17). Monocytes/macrophages have been historically 
investigated as the main target of this cytokine (18); however, IL-10 
acts also directly on T cells. This has been shown in the context of 
naïve T cells activation and differentiation (19, 20), in the regula-
tion of effector and memory T cells (Tmem) (21–23), and in the 
preservation of regulatory T cell (Treg) function (24, 25).
Here, we report a novel effect of TI-IFN that causes a selective 
inhibition of IL-10 signaling in T cells thereby reducing their 
capacity to be regulated. This loss of signaling correlates with the 
development of the disease in NOD mice. This effect is sustained 
but compartmentalized, manifesting only in T cells of pancreatic 
lymph nodes (PLN) and mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) of NOD 
mice, suggesting a link with the response to the gastric environ-
ment in these animals. Importantly, IL-10 signaling in T cells 
could be partially restored via blockade of TI-IFN signaling, sup-
porting earlier observations on the beneficial effects of transient 
TI-IFN blockade in NOD mice (13). Overall, our results reveal a 
new molecular mechanism involved in the causative process of 
type 1 diabetes and suggest novel targets for its prevention and 
treatment.
MaTerials anD MeThODs
Mice
Nonobese diabetic, wt C57BL/6 (B6), C57BL/6-Foxp3-GFP, 
IFN-AR1−/−, and Rag−/− mice were purchased from Jackson 
Laboratories, and bred at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine 
facility. All animal experiments were conducted in accordance 
with the National Institutes of Health guide for use and care of 
laboratory animals, and under a protocol approved by the JHU 
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Media, reagents, and antibodies
RPMI-1640 and IMDM media were supplemented with 10% v/v 
heat-inactivated FCS (Atlanta Biologicals, Flowery Branch, GA, 
USA), 0.1 mM non-essential amino acids, 2 mM l-glutamine, 
sodium pyruvate, 100 IU/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 
and 50 µM 2-ME (Gibco). Recombinant IFN-β and IFN-α were 
purchased from PBL Assay Science. Blocking anti-IFN-AR1 mAb 
was from Leinco Technologies (St. Louis, MO, USA). Recombinant 
IL-10 and IL-6 were from PeproTech (Rocky Hill, NJ, USA). Jak 
inhibitors Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib were purchased from LC 
Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA).
T cell (subsets) isolation
Spleen and lymph nodes were harvested and total/CD4 T cells 
were isolated via magnetic-bead negative selection. Briefly, 
cells were incubated with anti-mouse Ter119 (TER-119), Gr1 
(RB6-85C), CD11b (M1/70), B220 (RA3-6B2), CD16/32 (2.462), 
I-A/I-E (M5/114.15.2) [also anti-CD8 (53-6.7) for CD4 T cell 
purification] (all from BD Biosciences) followed by incubation 
with magnetic beads conjugated with anti-rat IgG (ThermoFisher) 
at a 1:1 (cell:bead) ratio. The resulting total/CD4 T cells were 
>90% pure. Where indicated, Treg (CD4+CD25+) were isolated 
from CD4 T cells following the protocol described in the EasySep 
PE-selection kit (STEMCELL technologies).
cD4 Tmem generation
In some experiments, Tmem were generated via a modifica-
tion of the published “parking method” (26). Briefly, 20 × 107 
T cells from B6 mice were activated with anti-CD3 (0.5 µg/ml; 
BD Pharmingen) in the presence of syngeneic LPS-matured 
bone marrow-derived DCs (1:20 ratio DC:T cell) as previously 
described (27). Three days later, activated T cells together with 
107 T cell-depleted splenocytes [obtained via removal of CD3+ 
cells from single cell suspensions using the protocol described in 
Section “T Cell (Subsets) Isolation”] were infused intravenously 
into Rag−/− mice. Four weeks later, Tmem were isolated and used 
for the indicated experiments.
cell stimulation and Preparation for 
Phospho-Flow analysis
For assessment of proteins phosphorylation via flow cytometry 
(Phospho-flow), a modification of the protocol published by 
the Nolan group (28) was utilized. Briefly, 10–15 × 106 purified 
T cells were cultured in IMDM complete media with/without 
IFN-β (1–25 ng/ml) for indicated periods and then rested in 
cytokine-free media for six additional hours. 2 × 106 fresh/
cultured cells were stimulated for 20 min with IL-10 (40 ng/ml) 
or IL-6 (40 ng/ml), or 30 min with IFN-β/α (5 ng/ml). Then, cells 
were fixed for 50 min by adding 2.4 ml of a solution containing 
4% paraformaldehyde and 1.4% methanol in PBS. After fixation, 
600 µl of 1× wash buffer (contained in the Transcription Factor 
Phospho Buffer Set kit, BD Biosciences) were added to the previ-
ous mixture, mixed, and spun down. Finally, cells were suspended 
with 500 µl Perm Buffer III (BD Biosciences) while vortexing, and 
stored at −20°C until use.
Flow cytometry and cell sorting
In Phospho-flow experiments, Perm Buffer III was removed 
and cells stained with fluorchrome-labeled antibodies against 
CD4 (RM4-5), CD44 (IM7), Foxp3 (FJK-1) (Thermo Fisher

eBioscience), and Stat3 (pY705) (4/P_STAT3; BD Phospho-flow). 
For IL-10R staining, the Human IL-10 biotinylated Fluorokine 
kit (R&D Systems) was used. Detection of suppressor of cytokine 
signaling protein (SOCS)1 and SOCS3 mRNA levels via flow 
cytometry was performed employing the PrimeFlow RNA assay 
kit (Thermo Fisher) following the manufacturer guidelines. Data 
were acquired using an LSR-II flow cytometer (BD Biosystems) 
and analyzed with FlowJo X version software (FLOWJO, LLC, 
Ashland, OR, USA). For WB and qPCR experiments using T cell 
subpopulations, fresh or cultured T cells were stained with CD4 
(RM4-5), CD25 (PC61) (not in the case of cells from Foxp3-GFP 
mice), and CD44 (IM7) antibodies and the specific subsets of 
Tmem (CD4+Foxp3−CD44+) and Treg (CD4+Foxp3/GFP+ or 
CD4+CD25+) were sorted to 99% purity using a FACS Aria II 
cell sorter.
Western Blot
Either total CD4 T cells or Tmem and Treg subpopulations after 
specific culture conditions were lysed with RIPA buffer contain-
ing proteases and phosphatases inhibitors. MG-132 (Millipore-
Sigma) was added for the last 1.5 h of culture in the experiments 
where SOCS protein levels were studied. Cell lysates were run 
in 10–12% acrylamide gels and proteins transferred to a PVDF 
membrane. Protein expression levels were detected with the 
following antibodies: phospho-STAT3 (Y705) (D3A7), SOCS1 
(A156), SOCS3 (L210) (all from Cell Signaling Technology), 
and β-actin (I-19; Santa Cruz biotechnology). Protein expression 
was detected using fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies 
(LI-COR). Data were acquired using an Odyssey CLx (LI-COR) 
imaging system and analyzed with ImageJ software to normalize 
values to β-actin levels.
Quantitative real-Time Pcr
CD4 T cells were lysed in TRIzol reagent (Thermo), and RNA 
was extracted using chloroform (Fisher Scientific) and the 
RNeasy MiniElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). The mRNA was reverse 
transcribed using the SuperScript IV First Strand Synthesis 
System and protocol (Thermo Scientific). Real-time RT-PCR 
was performed on a QuantiStudio 12K Flex Real-Time PCR 
system (Thermo Scientific) calibrated for SYBR Green detection. 
The primers and conditions employed are listed in Table S1 in 
Supplementary Material.
statistical analysis
Differences in flow cytometry quantification of P-STAT3-mean 
fluorescence intensity (MFI) were analyzed using either two-
sample Mann–Whitney U test or two-tailed paired Student’s 
t-test. To minimize the impact of fluctuations in fluorescence 
among experiments, the coefficient index (MFI P-STAT3 in 
stimulated cells/MFI P-STAT3 in unstimulated cells) was 
calculated and averaged for each experiment and then used for 
statistical analysis. P-STAT3 expression comparisons between 
T cells of NOD and B6 mice were analyzed using two-way 
ANOVA. Two-tailed unpaired Student’s t-test was applied to test 
gene expression differences from PCR experiments. All analyses 
were performed with Prism Software version 5.0 (GraphPad, La 
Jolla, CA, USA).
resUlTs
localized Defective il-10 signaling in 
Memory and regulatory cD4 T cells  
in Ti-iFn enriched Tissues
Li et al. reported unexpectedly high levels of IFNα production 
in the PLN of NOD mice starting in the second week of life that 
correlated with the presence of CD4 T cells with a transcriptional 
signature abundant in INF-induced genes (13). We examined via 
qPCR the expression of different interferons transcripts (Figure 
S1 in Supplementary Material) and found that IFN-α (IFNα4 
and IFNα9) but also IFN-β1 mRNA levels were upregulated 
in PLN of 4-week-old NOD mice when compared to the levels 
found in the spleen. This upregulation was maintained at least 
until the 12th week of life. Based on the suspected involvement of 
IL-10 in disease development, we tested if these TI-IFN-exposed 
T cells would show any alteration in their response to IL-10. To 
evaluate signal integrity, we quantified the accumulation of the 
phosphorylated (active) form of the transcription factor STAT3 
(P-STAT3, a key molecule in the IL-10 signaling pathway) in 
response to ex vivo stimulation with IL-10. The response to the 
pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 (that also induces phosphoryla-
tion of STAT3) was measured to distinguish between cytokine-
specific vs nonspecific effects of TI-IFN exposure. We compared 
multiple CD4 T cell subsets: naïve (CD4+CD44lowFoxp3−), 
memory (CD4+Foxp3−CD44hi), and regulatory (CD4+Foxp3+) 
T cells residing in PLN, MLN, axillary lymph nodes (ALN), and 
spleen (each separately) in 4-week-old NOD mice—the time of 
highest accumulation of IFNα and IFNβ [(13) and our data]. 
Independent repeats of these measurements indicated a statisti-
cally significant reduction in IL-10 signaling in both Tmem and 
Treg from PLN and also from MLN compared to the response of 
the same T cell subsets in the spleen (Figures 1A,B) and ALN (not 
shown). The reduced response in MLN paralleled the observed 
accumulation of TI-IFNs in these lymphoid tissues (Figure S1 
in Supplementary Material). In 4-week-old non-diabetes prone 
B6 mice, which do not accumulate TI-IFN in pancreatic and 
mesenteric lymph nodes (Figure S1 in Supplementary Material), 
Tmem and Treg preserved their ability to fully respond to IL-10 
in all lymphoid tissues (Figures 1A,B). Importantly, this decre-
ment in STAT3 phosphorylation was specific to IL-10 signaling, 
as the response to IL-6 was unaltered in the T cells of NOD 
(and B6) mice from all the lymphoid tissues tested (Figure 1C). 
Together, these results suggested that in NOD mice there is a 
selective reprogramming of the signaling for IL-10, actuated 
specifically in lymphoid tissues shown to accumulate TI-IFN 
(13).
The impact of Ti-iFn on il-10 signaling  
is not a genetic characteristic of nOD  
T cells
We then tested whether this effect was unique to T cells of NOD 
background, or bystander exposure of any T cells to unusual 
levels of TI-IFN could affect their ability to be controlled by 
IL-10. Bulk T cells from wt B6 mice were exposed to IFN-β 
or IFN-α for 48 h, and then the levels of P-STAT3 induced by

nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Cells of pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN), mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and spleens of 4-week-old NOD or C57BL/6 mice  
were either left untreated or stimulated with IL-10 (40 ng/ml) or IL-6 (40 ng/ml) for 20 min. Phosphorylated-STAT3 (P-STAT3) levels induced in CD4 T cell 
subpopulations (Tnaive: CD4+CD44lowFoxp3−, Tmem: CD4+CD44hiFoxp3−, and Treg: CD4+Foxp3+) were measured by Phospho-flow. (a) Representative

considering the levels in spleen as 100% of expression. Data shown in (B,c) are the average from n = 4 mice per strain and are expressed as % of ratio

stimulation with IL-10 or IL-6 were quantified via Phospho-
flow. Exposure to IFN-β induced a statistically significant 
reduction of STAT3 phosphorylation after IL-10 stimulation 
in Tmem and Tregs when compared to the response in fresh 
or mock-treated cells (cultured without IFN-β, to exclude 
any impact from the culturing conditions) (Figures 2A,B). 
These results were confirmed via western blot measurement of 
phospho-STAT3 levels (Figure 2D). Reduction of IL-10 signal-
ing was IFN-β dose-dependent, reaching maximum inhibition 
at 5 ng/ml of IFN-β (Figure S2A in Supplementary Material). 
Exposure to IFN-α induced a similar inhibition of IL-10 signal-
ing in a dose-dependent manner, though it required a higher 
concentration for maximal inhibition than IFN-β (Figure S2B 
in Supplementary Material). As observed in T cells from NOD 
mice, the levels of P-STAT3 in response to IL-6 stimulation 
remained unaltered under all conditions (Figures 2A,C), con-
firming that this effect was not a generalized saturation of the 
Jak/STAT signaling pathway.
iFn-β-Mediated inhibition of il-10 
signaling alters induction of il-10 
responsive genes
A deeper evaluation of the functional impact that inhibition of 
IL-10 signaling by TI-IFN has on the modulation of T cells can 
be done via assessment of its transcriptional impact. However, 
the transcriptional impact of IL-10 on T cells is unknown. We 
therefore harnessed the vast knowledge about IL-10 signaling in 
antigen-presenting cells. Taking advantage of data from the most 
recent publicly available RNAseq analysis of mouse macrophages 
exposed to IL-10 (29), we selected a pool of 29 genes highly 
upregulated (>6σ) (Figure S3A in Supplementary Material) as 
initial lead for genes that could be also induced in T cells. Ten of 
these upregulated genes had known functions in T cells (Figure 
S3B in Supplementary Material). We then tested the expression 
of these genes as a screening panel for further investigation of 
Treg and Tmem cells responses to IL-10 with or without TI-IFN 
pre-exposure. To obtain a sufficient and homogeneous number

of the strain of origin. (a–c) Purified T cells from C57BL/6 mice were freshly stimulated or cultured for 48 h in complete media with or without IFN-β (5 ng/ml), and 
rested in cytokine-free media for six additional hours. Cells were then either left untreated or stimulated with IL-10 (40 ng/ml) or IL-6 (40 ng/ml) for 20 min, and the 
levels of P-STAT3 in CD4 T cell subpopulations were measured by Phospho-flow as in Figure 1. (a) Representative histograms of the mean fluorescence intensity

(CD4+Foxp3-GFP+) subpopulations were flow sorted. After a 6 h resting phase, cells were left untreated or stimulated with IL-10 (40 ng/ml) for 20 min, lysed and  
the levels of pSTAT3 compared to β-actin were measured by Western Blot. Data from n = 3 individual experiments are shown and expressed as a relative

of Tmem, we implemented the previously published “parking 
method” (see Materials and Methods) where in vitro-activated 
T cells are “parked” in congenic Rag−/− mice to generate Tmem 
(26). Tregs were freshly isolated from unmanipulated animals. 
Gene transcription analysis showed four genes—LIGHT 
(Tnfsf14), Sphk1, Tarm1, and 2B4—to be significantly upregulated 
in Tmem by in vitro treatment with IL-10 (Figure 3A), and two 
genes, Sphk1 and 2B4, were upregulated in Treg. We then analyzed 
if the induction of these genes was affected by pre-exposure of 
these cells in vitro to IFN-β. In Tmem, the increased expression of 
LIGHT, Sphk1, Tarm1, and 2B4 was completely abrogated. mRNA 
levels of Sphk1, LIGHT, and Tarm1 also showed an important 
decrease in IFN-β exposed Treg, while the expression of 2B4 was 
not affected. Supported by these results, we determined whether 
the in vivo exposure of NOD T cells to normal (spleen) or high 
levels of TI-IFN (PLN and MLN) affected the induction of these 
genes by IL-10. Tmem and Tregs were flow sorted from spleen and 
from pooled PLN + MLN and then stimulated ex vivo with IL-10 
(Figure 3B). Tmem cells from the spleen showed a significant 
upregulation of LIGHT, Sphk1, and Tarm1, while all four genes 
could not be induced by IL-10 in cells from PLN + MLN. In NOD 
Treg, IL-10 induced a statistical increase in LIGHT and Tarm1 
in cells from the spleen while, again, none of them was upregu-
lated in cells from PLN + MLN. These results indicate that the 
selective inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation induced by INF-β 
pre-exposure alters significantly the impact of IL-10-induced 
transcription in Tmem and Tregs both in vitro and in vivo.
inhibition of il-10 signaling requires 
Prolonged exposure to iFn-β, but it is 
reversible
To explore what length of exposure to IFN-β is required to impact 
IL-10 signaling in T cells, wt B6 bulk T cells were exposed to 
IFN-β for different lengths of time and the response to IL-10 and 
IL-6 (not shown) in different subsets assessed by Phospho-flow. 
In Tmem cells, a 24-h exposure significantly reduced the levels 
of IL-10-induced P-STAT3, but a 48-h exposure was necessary 
to achieve maximal inhibition (Figure 4A). In Tregs, a 24-h 
exposure was sufficient to achieve the maximal inhibition of 
IL-10-induced P-STAT3 signaling (Figure 4A).
We also tested the reversibility of this inhibition. To address 
this question, after 48 h of exposure to IFN-β, T cells were washed, 
rested in cytokine-free media for 24 or 48 h and the P-STAT3

(obtained using the “parking method”; see Materials and Methods) and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) from C57BL/6 mice were left untreated or cultured

(40 ng/ml). (B) Freshly purified Tmem and Treg (CD4+CD25+) from spleen and pooled pancreatic lymph nodes (PLN) + mesentheric lymph nodes (MLN) were either

qPCR. ΔΔCt method was used to calculate their relative expression and then normalized to GAPDH. The graph bars show the fold change between unstimulated 
and stimulated conditions in the different groups ± SEM. *p < 0.05 in unpaired Student’s t-test was considered statistically significant. Data show the average of 
n = 3 independent experiments (a) or n = 4 animals per group (B).

response to IL-10 or IL-6 (not shown) was then measured. Within 
24 h of removing IFN-β, Treg recovered their normal P-STAT3 
response to IL-10 (Figure 4B). The recovery of Tmem was slower, 
showing only partial restoration of the IL-10 signaling even at 
48 h after removing the IFN-β (Figure 4B). We then determined 
if the reversibility of inhibition applied also to NOD T cells from 
PLN and MLN, where they are exposed to high concentrations 
of a cocktail of TI-IFNs (and possibly for a long period of time). 
Total cells from spleen, PLN, and MLN of NOD mice were freshly 
isolated, rested in cytokine-free media for 48 h, and the P-STAT3 
response to IL-10 was then measured. Results showed a signifi-
cant recovery in both Treg and Tmem cells from PLN and MLN 
rested in IFN-β free media (Figure 4C). These results indicate 
that the bystander effect of IFN-β requires a prolonged exposure

iFn-β signals Through the Jak/sTaT 
Pathway to inhibit il-10 signaling in  
T cells
Type-I interferons signal through multiple pathways (30), with 
the activation of the Jak/STAT route considered the most rel-
evant to their antiviral effects. To identify the signaling pathway 
responsible for the actuation of IFN-β-induced perturbations of 
IL-10 signaling, cells were pre-treated with two small molecule 
Jak-specific inhibitors, Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib, prior to and 
during IFN-β stimulation. Tofacitinib inhibits Jak3 and Jak1, 
while Ruxolitinib blocks Jak2 and Jak1. After preconditioning 
bulk T cells with Tofacitinib (25 µM) or Ruxolitinib (5 µM) for 
2 h, IFN-β was added to the cultures for 48 h. Following incuba-
tion and washing, an additional 6–8 h resting phase allowed the 
cells to recover their signaling after removal of the Jak inhibitor 
(Figure S4 in Supplementary Material). The impact on IL-10 or 
IL-6 signaling was then quantified via phospho-flow. In Tmem,

then rested in cytokine-free media for additional 6 h. The response to IL-10 of each subpopulation was then assessed via Phospho-flow. Data of n = 3 individual 
experiments are shown and expressed as % of ratio mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) ± SEM, *p < 0.05, **p ≤ 0.01, paired Student’s t-test.

Tofacitinib treatment resulted in a statistically significant preser-
vation of IL-10 signaling and Ruxolitinib had an even stronger 
effect (Figure 5A). In Treg, both inhibitors restored IL-10 signal-
ing to the same extent (Figure 5A), though the cells had to be 
rested for 8 h (instead of 6 h as in the case of Tmem), as their 
recovery of cytokines signaling after Jak inhibition was slower 
than in Tmem. Collectively, these results suggest that Jak1, and 
possibly Jak2, are essential mediators for IFN-β-mediated altera-
tions of IL-10-induced P-STAT3 signaling in T cells.
Our data indicate that TI-IFN causes inhibition of IL-10 sign-
aling through a process that requires 24/48 h of exposure. This 
suggests that multiple intracellular molecular modifications are 
needed to achieve this phenotype and the process could require the 
synthesis and activity of additional extracellular mediators. To test 
this hypothesis, we employed a co-culture system with T cells defi-
cient for the receptor of TI-IFN (IFN-AR1−/−; unable to respond 
to IFN-α or -β). These cells have a response to IL-10 comparable 
to that displayed by wild type cells (Figure S5 in Supplementary 
Material). We then exposed B6 wild-type congenic T cells (CD45.1+ 
from B6/SJL mice) mixed at 1:1 ratio with B6-IFN-AR1−/− T cells 
(expressing the CD45.2 isoform) to IFN-β. If the TI-IFN-induced 
inhibition of IL-10 signaling requires the synthesis and secretion of 
an intermediate factor, this molecule would also affect the response 
of IFN-AR1−/− T cells in our co-culture system (Figure 5B). 
Phospho-flow analysis indicated that while wild-type Tmem and 
Tregs showed a reduction of IL-10 signaling after IFN-β exposure, 
the co-cultured IFN-AR1−/− cells remained completely unaffected 
(Figure 5C). These results demonstrate that IFN-β acts directly on 
T cells to condition IL-10 signaling.
alteration of surface il-10 receptor 
expression or induction of sOcs 
Molecules are not responsible For 
inhibition of il-10 signaling
Downregulation of IL-10R surface expression would be a plausible 
mechanism to account for the inhibition of IL-10 signaling fol-
lowing exposure to TI-IFN. However, flow cytometric analysis of 
IL-10R surface expression did not support this hypothesis. IFN-β 
exposed T cells (both Tmem and Treg), expressed levels of the 
receptor comparable to that of non-exposed cells (Figure 6A). 
In line with this, the comparison of IL-10R expression between 
NOD T cells isolated from the PLN, MLN, ALN, and spleen 
showed no differences in the MFI (Figure 6B). This result sug-
gested the involvement of an IL-10R-specific regulator acting 
between the receptor and STAT3 (as STAT3 remains available for 
the IL-6 receptor to be phosphorylated). SOCSs act as cytokine-
inducible negative regulators of cytokine signaling. We tested if 
the transcriptional levels of SOCS1 (the only regulator reported 
in the literature to be associated with inhibition of IL-10 signal-
ing in a lymphoma cell line) (31) and SOCS3 (as control; it does 
not inhibit IL-10R) were increased by IFN-β treatment. Despite 
a reduction in the SOCS1 and SOCS3 RNA levels in cultured 
T cells compared to fresh cells, the transcription levels of SOCS1 
and SOCS3 were not increased by IFN-β treatment (Figure 6C). 
These results were confirmed in Tmem and Treg subpopulations 
via Prime FlowRNA (Affymetrix)—technology that allows 
detection via flow cytometry of RNA and protein expression 
simultaneously at single cell level—clearly showing that the levels

of SOCS1 and SOCS3 RNA were not upregulated in Tmem and 
Tregs exposed to IFN-β (Figure 6D). Finally, we assessed the level 
of SOCS1 and SOCS3 protein via western blot at both early time 
point after addition of IFN-β as well as at the investigated 48 h 
(Figure 6E). Results indicate that despite IFN-β induces a modest 
increase in SOCS1 levels in the first few hours of stimulation, such 
increase is not sustained at 48 h and excludes the involvement of 
SOCS1 in IL-10 signaling inhibition.
The localized Defective response to 
il-10 in Tmem and Tregs of nOD Mice  
is Maintained With age
Knowing whether the inhibition of IL-10 signaling in T cells 
of PLN and MLN of NOD mice is sustained or altered over 
time is important for defining possible windows of therapeutic 
intervention. The accumulation of TI-IFN in PLN (13) appears 
maintained over time, though to a progressively lower level. As 
the inhibition of IL-10 signaling correlates with TI-IFN levels, 
we executed a longitudinal analysis of the response to IL-10 and 
IL-6 by Treg and Tmem cells of female NOD mice of different 
ages (weeks: 2, 3, 4, 6, 12, and 18). An identical analysis was 
performed in age-matched female wt B6 mice. Throughout the 
observation period, the ratio of IL-10 induced P-STAT3 in T cells 
between PLN/spleen and MLN/spleen (as shown in Figure 1) was 
significantly lower than that exhibited by B6 mice (Figure 7A). 
Interestingly, in 2-week-old B6 mice, the response to IL-10 of 
Tmem and Tregs in PLN and MLN was slightly lower than that 
observed in the spleen (<100%), but it quickly recovered and 
stabilized (Figure 7A).

The early Blockade of Ti-iFn signaling 
Partially restores the response to il-10  
in Pln and Mln Tmem and Tregs in  
nOD Mice
The reported delay and lower incidence of diabetes development 
in NOD mice treated at 2–3 weeks of age with an anti-IFN-AR1 
mAb (13), together with the reversibility of IL-10 signaling inhi-
bition we observed in vitro in T cells after removing IFN-β, are 
encouraging indications that the unbalanced immune regulation 
of NOD mice can be prevented or restored. To test if the thera-
peutic blockade of TI-IFN and alteration of IL-10 signaling were 
correlated in vivo in NOD mice, anti-IFN-AR1 mAb was admin-
istered on days 14 and 21 of age in female NOD mice and, on day 
25, we measured the induction of P-STAT3 in PLN and MLN 
T cell subsets in response to ex vivo IL-10 treatment. Both Tmem 
and Treg populations in PLN and MLN of anti-IFN-AR-treated 
animals showed a significant recovery in P-STAT3 induction in 
response to IL-10 (Figures 7B,C). These results suggest that the 
therapeutic effect of early administration of anti-IFN-AR1 mAb 
in NOD mice may be due to the restoration of IL-10 signaling.
DiscUssiOn
In addition to genetic susceptibility, type 1 diabetes development 
is clearly linked to still poorly defined environmental factors 
contributing to the initiation and/or progression of the disease. 
There is a growing number of reports that associate high levels of 
TI-IFN with the onset and progression of this pathology (8–10, 
12–14). However, mechanistic insights on how TI-IFN would 
favor type 1 diabetes development are lacking, contributing 
to a degree of confusion in understanding this connection. In 
particular, how the accumulation of TI-IFN could result in a 
localized effect that enables the activity of diabetogenic T cells 
remains an enigma. The finding that dendritic cells of NOD mice 
produce higher levels of TI-IFN in response to TLR stimulation 
than cells of B6 mice (32) provides an important clue to the 
causes of localized and chronic TI-IFN accumulation in PLN 
reported previously (13). Based on our results, we propose that 
this chronic accumulation of TI-IFN in NOD mice, which we 
report for the first time also extends to the MLN, re-programs 
the response of CD4 Treg and Tmem to IL-10 and potentially 
diminishes the homeostatic regulation of diabetogenic cells. This 
phenomenon likely contributes to the progressive attack to the 
islets and development of the disease. These data are supported 
by the recovery of IL-10 signaling we observed after blockade of 
TI-IFN–IFNR1 interactions, a treatment that results in a reduc-
tion of the disease incidence and progression in NOD mice (13).
Our results provide some important clues on the molecular 
mechanism behind the inhibition of IL-10 signaling. The normal 
level of phosphorylation of STAT3 we measured in response to 
IL-6 in T cells pre-exposed to IFN-β suggested that the impair-
ment observed in IL-10 signaling is not caused by a generalized 
reduction in the cytoplasmic availability of STAT3. The lack of 
upregulation of SOCS1 and SOCS3 (at either the mRNA or protein 
level) and the unaltered (if not slightly increased) expression of 
IL-10R in T cells we observed post-IFN-β exposure both in vitro 
and in vivo do not support regulation of P-STAT3 induction at 
this level. Our results suggest then that an IL-10 signaling negative 
regulator acting between the receptor and STAT3 phosphoryla-
tion is either being upregulated or activated. For example, direct 
or indirect alterations in the binding and phosphorylation of Jak1 
and Tyk2 would regulate STAT3 activation (33); the involvement 
of molecules that interact with STAT3, including other mem-
bers of the STAT family, should also be explored as they could 
interfere with its binding to IL-10R and its phosphorylation (30). 
Interestingly, human monocytes and macrophages primed with 
IFNα/β showed an increase in IL-10R1 and an increase in IL-10 
signaling (34). However, these experiments were performed with 
an acute exposure (5 h) to TI-IFN. A prolonged exposure of 
human macrophages to TI-IFN promoted a switch in the signal-
ing of IL-10 from activation of STAT3 to STAT1 (35, 36); in our 
settings, however, STAT1 phosphorylation was not appreciable 
in any condition tested (not shown). Overall, these observations 
suggest that IFN-β can have different consequences depending 
on the timing and context of exposure as well as on the target cell 
population, probably contributing to the (sometimes discordant) 
range of outcomes attributed to TI-IFN (37). Our ongoing work 
is now focused on dissecting these regulatory mechanisms and 
identify previously unappreciated modulators of IL-10 signaling.
The protective effect of Tofacitinib and Ruxolitinib we 
observed in our experiments indicates that signaling through the 
Jak/STAT pathway is involved in this specific effect of TI-IFN—
though we cannot exclude the participation of other signaling 
routes (38). A deeper understanding of the molecular mediators 
of this phenomenon would be of crucial importance as some of 
these molecules could be targeted to control the development 
of diabetes. In fact, Jak1/Jak2 inhibition in vivo is effective at

preventing, and reverting, established insulitis in NOD mice 
 
(39, 40). Improving the efficacy and safety of this type of interven-
tion would be a major advancement for type 1 diabetes patients.
Our study shows that Tmem and Treg with impaired IL-10 
signaling are present not only in PLN but also in the regionally 
close MLN. Paralleling the results from Rahman and colleagues 
(32), this phenomenon is specific for NOD animals, as in B6 
mice, the response to IL-10 was not affected. This strain-specific 
effect in lymph nodes draining the gut (41) suggests a link with 
the recently discovered role of the microbiota in autoimmune 
diabetes development (2, 4); it could indicate an aberrant height-
ened chronic response to specific bacterial (or viral) derivatives 
that is not properly regulated. The initial impairment in IL-10 
signaling we observed in 2-week-old B6 pups (similar to, but 
not to the same extent as, that of NOD mice, Figure 7), could 
indicate an initial adaptation phase of the newly generated pool 
of T cells (exposed to TI-IFN in the thymus) (42) to variations in 
the intestinal flora during the breast-feeding phase. This would 
suggest that the genetic predisposition of NOD mice encom-
passes a defect in establishing the proper balance in the response 
to microbiota derivatives in the gut-draining lymph nodes that 
ultimately affects the regulation of diabetogenic T cells by IL-10.
We observed that the impact of TI-IFN is not specific to the 
NOD genetic background, suggesting that this novel mechanism 
of alteration of immunoregulation could also contribute to the 
development of other disorders with a TI-IFN signature (43). 
This is a significant finding as the reduction of IL-10 signaling 
in Treg and Tmem populations has very deleterious effects on 
regulating autoreactivity (23–25). In animal models of diabetes 
(44, 45) as well as diabetic patients (46), Tregs exhibit reduced 
regulatory efficacy while effector T cells are resistant to regulation 
(44). Altogether, these results point toward a loss of regulation of 
autoreactive T lymphocytes as a key process in diabetes devel-
opment. A selective targeting of this phenomenon, by either 
correcting the aberrant production of TI-IFN or by preventing 
its modulation of IL-10 signaling, could significantly improve 
the efficacy of some approaches currently being explored for 
the treatment of type 1 diabetes (47). Targeting IL-10 signaling 
has already been considered in the treatment of this disease 
 
(16, 17). However, inconsistent effects have been reported (48–51). 
Based on our results, we suggest that, rather than augmenting the 
concentration of IL-10, a targeted restoration of the IL-10 impact 
on diabetogenic cells (via a timed and localized intervention) 
would achieve more successful therapeutic outcomes. To this end, 
understanding how IL-10 modulates T cell function is necessary 
to identify the best strategy to recover an appropriate level of regu-
lation but, to date, very little is known. We report here for the first 
time several genes (Sphk1, LIGHT, Tarm1, and 2B4) that IL-10 
induces in T cells. We used their expression as readout of IL-10 
function, demonstrating the impact of pre-exposure to TI-IFN 
both in vitro and in vivo in NOD mice. Our future studies will be 
centered on understanding the transcriptional impact of IL-10 on 
T cells and the involvement of specific genes in the modulation 
of T cell functions. Moreover, the differential expression profile 
of the four genes between Tmem and Treg populations suggests a 
distinct role in each population; a property that could also reveal 
strategies to selectively impact these two subsets.
In summary, our study unveils the existence of a new molecular 
mechanism through which TI-IFN can alter T cell regulation and 
improves our understanding of IL-10-mediated control of Treg 
and Tmem cells. A deeper understanding of this phenomenon 
will very likely reveal novel points of intervention to restore the 
necessary immune regulatory network to potentiate the efficacy 
of immunotherapies for type 1 diabetes and possibly other auto-
immune diseases.
