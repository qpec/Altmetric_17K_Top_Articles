Context: Evidence of an association between dietary patterns and individual foods
and the risk of overall mortality among cancer survivors has not been reviewed
systematically. Objective: The aim of this meta-analysis of cohort studies was to in-
vestigate the association between food intake and dietary patterns and overall mor-
tality among cancer survivors. Data Sources: The PubMed and Embase databases
were searched. Study Selection: A total of 117 studies enrolling 209 597 cancer
survivors were included. Data Extraction: The following data were extracted: study
location, types of outcome, population characteristics, dietary assessment method,
risk estimates, and adjustment factors. Results: Higher intakes of vegetables and
fish were inversely associated with overall mortality, and higher alcohol consump-
tion was positively associated with overall mortality (RR, 1.08; 95%CI, 1.02–1.16).
Adherence to the highest category of diet quality was inversely associated with over-
all mortality (RR, 0.78; 95%CI, 0.72–0.85; postdiagnosis RR, 0.79; 95%CI, 0.71–0.89),
as was adherence to the highest category of a prudent/healthy dietary pattern (RR,
0.81; 95%CI, 0.67–0.98; postdiagnosis RR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.60–0.99). The Western diet-
ary pattern was associated with increased risk of overall mortality (RR, 1.46; 95%CI,
1.27–1.68; postdiagnosis RR, 1.51; 95%CI, 1.24–1.85). Conclusion: Adherence to a
high-quality diet and a prudent/healthy dietary pattern is inversely associated with
overall mortality among cancer survivors, whereas a Western dietary pattern is
positively associated with overall mortality in this population.
INTRODUCTION
The number of cancer survivors in the United States
and Europe is growing rapidly.1,2 The needs and meta-
bolic functions of this group, who have experienced a
malignant process and its corresponding treatment,
might differ from those of healthy populations. To date,
however, the evidence to formulate specific dietary recom-
mendations for this group has been considered insuffi-
cient,3 despite the widely held conviction that better
insight into both the role of diet after cancer and the rela-
tion of diet to survival might offer further opportunities to

 improve long-term treatment options for this growing
population. Whereas recent meta-analyses of observational
studies clearly demonstrate reduced risks of different types
of cancer among healthy populations that follow specific
dietary regimens,4–7 a comparable synthesis of empirical
data for cancer survivors, such as a systematic review and
meta-analysis, is available only for breast cancer survivors,
and even then, the literature is sparse.8 Furthermore, pro-
spective cohort studies that have investigated the associ-
ation between composition of diet and overall mortality
among cancer survivors show contradicting results.9 A fur-
ther complicating factor is that some studies evaluated the
relationship between mortality and nutrients instead of be-
tween mortality and food patterns,9,10 the latter being
more easily understood and reflecting more accurately the
lifestyles of the targeted population. Therefore, the current
dietary advice for cancer survivors is to receive personal-
ized nutritional care from a trained professional and to fol-
low current recommendations for cancer prevention, if
not otherwise advised.3
Most of the single cohort studies on cancer sur-
vivors have focused on associations between prediagno-
sis dietary intake, especially alcohol intake, and overall
mortality and/or cancer recurrence, while only a few
studies have assessed associations with postdiagnosis
dietary intake11–13 Clinical trials enrolling subjects with
existing cancer have the advantage of possessing data
on the postdiagnosis diet; however, such studies often
focus on nutrients rather than dietary patterns or food
groups and are weakly suited for studying long-term
successful dietary interventions.
A better understanding of the effect of food intake
and food-based dietary patterns on overall mortality
and recurrence among cancer survivors can inform the
development of tailored prevention strategies in the im-
portant area of modifiable lifestyle factors such as diet.
Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct a
meta-analysis of all cohort studies that investigated the
effects of adherence to diet-quality indices, dietary pat-
terns, and food and beverage consumption on overall
mortality and cancer recurrence among cancer survivors.
METHODS
The
review
protocol
has
been
registered
in
the
PROSPERO
International
Prospective
Register
of
Systematic Reviews (no. CRD42015023684).
Data sources and searches
The literature search was performed using the elec-
tronic databases PubMed (until May 17, 2016) and
Embase (until May 17, 2016), with no restrictions on
calendar date, using the following search terms: (“diet”
OR “dietary” OR “food” OR “foods” OR “alcohol”)
AND (“cancer”) AND (“survivors” OR “survivor” OR
“recurrence”) AND (“prospective” OR “cohort” OR
“longitudinal” OR “follow up”). The search strategy had
no language restrictions. Moreover, the reference lists
of reviews and retrieved articles were checked as well.
The literature search was conducted by 2 authors (C.S.
and L.S.); disagreements were resolved by discussion.
MOOSE guidelines14 were followed when planning,
conducting, and reporting the meta-analysis.
Study selection
Studies were included in the systematic review and
meta-analyses if they met the following criteria (Table 1):
(1) cohort study design (prospective and retrospective);
(2) exposure to individual food components such as
fruits, vegetables, dairy, meat, fish, cereals, and bread; (3)
exposure to beverages such as alcohol, coffee, and tea; (4)
use of diet-quality indices (Mediterranean diet, DASH
[Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension], Healthy
Eating Index, WCRF/AIRC [World Cancer Research
Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research] dietary
guidelines adherence score) that were determined a pri-
ori; (5) examination of data-driven dietary patterns
(healthy/prudent, unhealthy/Western); (6) overall mor-
tality and/or cancer recurrence included in reported out-
comes; and (7) study participants limited to adult
populations (�18 years old) of survivors of various

 cancer types (the definition of “cancer survivor” does not
include survivors of cervical lesions or adenomas in the
colon). When a study seemed to have been published in
duplicate, the article containing the most comprehensive
information (longest follow-up period) was selected.
Finally, studies reporting cancer-specific mortality (but
no overall mortality) were excluded.
Data extraction
The following data were extracted from each study: (1)
author’s last name; (2) country of origin and name of
the study; (3) types of outcome (overall mortality, can-
cer recurrence); (4) sample size of the population and
length of the study (mean follow-up duration in years);
(5) age of participants at entry; (6) sex of participants;
(7) tumor characteristics; (8) assessment of recurrence;
(9) exposure assessment, including timeframe; (10)
components of diet-quality indices/dietary patterns
(including score range); (11) adjustment factors; and
(12) multivariate-adjusted risk estimates (risk ratio
[RR] or hazard ratio for the highest vs the lowest cat-
egory) along with their corresponding 95%CIs. If only
separate risk estimates were available for specific foods
(ie, processed meat and unprocessed meat) or beverages
within a food/beverages category (ie, meat), the risk es-
timates were pooled (using a fixed-effects model) and
were treated as 1 study. Moreover, if different categories
of alcohol consumption (ie, current and ex-drinkers)
were combined (the lowest intake category was con-
sidered the reference category), these estimates were
pooled (using a fixed-effects model). When a study pro-
vided several risk estimates, the multivariate-adjusted
model was chosen. Risk estimates were pooled if at least
3 studies reported data for the same exposures (eg, diet-
quality indices, dietary patterns, and intakes of fruit,
vegetables, dairy, meat, fish, cereals and bread, and bev-
erages [alcohol, tea, coffee]) for overall mortality and
cancer recurrence.
Statistical analysis
The meta-analysis was performed by combining the
multivariable-adjusted RRs or hazard ratios of the high-
est dietary categories compared with the lowest dietary
categories using a random-effects model (using the Der
Simonian-Laird method15), which incorporated both
within- and between-study variability. This model was
chosen because exposures were not rare, and the het-
erogeneity modeling was deemed important. For clarity,
studies of each exposure were grouped by type of cancer
(analyzed jointly and separately) when calculating
overall mortality and cancer recurrence. As an initial
approach,
the
prediagnosis
and
the
postdiagnosis
assessments of exposure were combined and then
stratified.
Main analyses assessed food categories before and
after diagnosis for all types of cancer. Separate subgroup
analyses were performed for studies that assessed post-
diagnosis diet and for all studies grouped by type of
cancer.
Heterogeneity was estimated by the Cochrane Q test,
together with the I2 test. An I2 of >50% was considered
an indicator of substantial heterogeneity across studies, as
previously reported.16,17 The heterogi command in Stata
software (Stata Corp; College Station, TX, USA) was used
to calculate the 95%CI for the heterogeneity estimates.
Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects if at
least 10 studies were available, as recommended by the
Cochrane Collaboration.18 Moreover, Egger’s test was
performed to test for small-study effects.19 The presence
of publication bias was assessed by the symmetry of
contour-enhanced funnel plots by plotting risk estimates
against their corresponding standard error; shaded areas
indicate whether studies with significant or nonsignificant
effects seem to be missing.20
All analyses were conducted using Review Manager
version 5.3 (Nordic Cochrane Collection; Copenhagen,
Denmark) and Stata 13.0.

Supporting Information online provides a list of full-
text articles that were excluded, with reasons.
Overall, 117 cohort studies extracted from 1658
studies (excluding duplicates) were identified and
included in the qualitative synthesis (112 included in
the quantitative synthesis) (Table S2 in the Supporting
Information online).
General study characteristics are summarized in
Table S2 in the Supporting Information online. Overall,
there were 60 134 mortality cases and 9297 recurrence
cases. This information was not available for 14 studies,
which provided survival or disease-/recurrence-free sur-
vival rates (11 provided no information on explicit cases
of mortality, and 6 provided no information on cases of
cancer recurrence). The total number of participants in
the included studies was 209 597. The breakdown of
studies according to cancer type is as follows: 41 studies
on breast cancer survivors, 18 studies on colorectal can-
cer survivors, 16 studies on head and neck cancer

 survivors, and 13 studies on gastroesophageal cancer
survivors. The sample sizes varied between 57 in a study
of head and neck cancer patients from a single institu-
tion in Switzerland to 22 890 in a large breast cancer co-
hort from the United States. The follow-up periods
varied from 1.2 to 16 years.
Nine of the included studies used diet-quality scores
defined a priori as the exposure measure. Seven of these
studies used the Healthy Eating Index (2010 or 2005) or
an adapted version of it.21 A Mediterranean diet score
was used in 3 studies and the DASH diet as a score in 2
studies. A WCRF/AIRC dietary guidelines adherence
score was used in 1 study, assigning a point to every diet-
ary recommendation met. Furthermore, another study
used 2 healthy-diet scores (the Diet Quality Index
Revised [DQIR]22 and the Recommended Food Score23)
that had been developed and used in previous studies.
Similar to the other scores mentioned, these indices as-
sign points to a diet high in whole grains, fruit, and vege-
table consumption and lower in fat consumption. The
DQIR additionally awards points for diet diversity. For
the quantitative synthesis, the following diet-quality indi-
ces were combined: the alternate Healthy Eating Index
(2010),21 the Healthy Eating Index (2005),24 the WCRF/
AIRC (dietary) guidelines adherence score,25 the alter-
nate Mediterranean diet,26,27 the DASH diet,28 the
DQIR,22 and the Recommended Food Score.23 All indi-
ces for dietary quality focus on high intake of fruit and
vegetables, the inclusion of whole grains, legumes and
nuts, and low intake of meat (mainly red and processed
meat). Eight of these 9 studies were included in the
meta-analysis. The ninth study was not included because

 another study on the same cancer cohort provided a lon-
ger follow-up period.
Nine studies assessed the effects of dietary patterns on
overall mortality or cancer recurrence. All of these studies
used principal component analysis to derive the patterns,
which, in most cases, were termed whole-foods, prudent,
or healthy if they described a pattern of intake high in fruit
and vegetables and whole grains but low in red and pro-
cessed meat, refined grains, and high-fat foods. Otherwise,
patterns describing a diet perceived as unhealthy were
mostly labeled as Western, high-fat or high-sugar, snacks,
or unhealthy. For the purpose of this study, patterns were
grouped into prudent/healthy and Western/unhealthy
dietary patterns. The prudent/healthy food pattern in-
cludes high intakes of fruit and vegetables, whole grains,
poultry, and low-fat dairy products, whereas the Western/
unhealthy dietary pattern is based on high intakes of red
and processed meat, refined grains, sweets and desserts,
and high-fat dairy products (Table S2 in the Supporting
Information online).
Enumerative data for food groups and beverages
are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
Main outcomes
The different clinical outcomes documented in the ex-
tracted studies were distributed as follows: overall mor-
tality was evaluated in 117 studies (112 included in the
meta-analysis) and cancer recurrence in 28 studies (27
included in the meta-analysis) (see Figures S1–S28 in
the Supporting Information online).

ation for risk of mortality could be observed for the

 highest intakes of vegetables (RR, 0.86, 95%CI, 0.79–
0.94; I2 ¼ 43%) and fish (RR, 0.85, 95%CI, 0.78–0.93;
I2 ¼ 0%). Alcohol consumption was associated with
increased risk of overall mortality (RR, 1.08; 95%CI,
1.02–1.16; I2 ¼ 70%). With respect to the remaining
food groups, no significant associations could be
observed for intakes of dairy, meat, cereals and bread,
eggs, tea, red meat, or processed meat. When only stud-
ies providing data on postdiagnosis food intakes were
retained in the analysis, the results showed no statistic-
ally significant associations (Table 2).
Adherence to a high-quality diet was inversely asso-
ciated with overall mortality (RR, 0.78; 95%CI, 0.72–
0.85, I2 ¼ 0%) (Figure 227,29–34 and Table 2). These ef-
fects remained consistent following analysis of only the
postdiagnosis diet-quality indices (RR, 0.79; 95%CI,
0.71–0.89; I2 ¼ 0%). The highest category of prudent
healthy dietary pattern was inversely associated with
overall mortality, both in the main analysis (RR, 0.81;
95%CI, 0.67–0.98; I2 ¼ 44%) and when taking only post-
diagnosis diet into account (RR, 0.77; 95%CI, 0.60–0.99;
I2 ¼ 56%). Conversely, the highest category of adher-
ence to a Western dietary pattern was associated with
increased risk of overall mortality (RR, 1.46; 95%CI,
1.27–1.68; I2 ¼ 0%), which could also be found when
synthesizing data of postdiagnosis Western dietary pat-
tern only (RR, 1.51; 95%CI, 1.24–1.85; I2 ¼ 17%)
(Figure 327,35–41 and Table 2).
Cancer recurrence
When data for pre- and postdiagnosis levels of alcohol
consumption were combined, an increased risk of can-
cer recurrence was found (RR, 1.17; 95%CI, 1.05–1.31;
I2 ¼ 38%). When only data for postdiagnosis alcohol in-
take were retained in the analysis, the results remained
unchanged (RR, 1.31; 95%CI, 1.04–1.66; I2 ¼ 54%). No
significant associations between cancer recurrence and
vegetable or tea intake could be observed. The intake of
other food groups such as fruit, dairy, and coffee could
not be meta-analyzed because of the limited number of
eligible studies (minimum of 3) (Table 3).
The highest category of adherence to a prudent/
healthy dietary pattern was not associated with cancer
recurrence when compared with the lowest category of
adherence (RR, 0.87; 95%CI, 0.68–1.11; I2 ¼ 24%).
These results were confirmed when the postdiagnosis
pattern was analyzed (RR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.71–1.24;
I2 ¼ 19%). Moreover, the Western dietary patterns were
not associated with any significant effects on cancer re-
currence data (RR, 1.21; 95%CI, 0.69–2.13; I2 ¼ 81%)
(postdiagnosis: RR, 1.34; 95%CI, 0.61–2.92; I2 ¼ 85%)
(Table 3).
Subgroup analyses for types of cancer
Breast cancer. No evidence of an association with over-
all mortality was observed for individual foods, includ-
ing
fruits,
vegetables,
dairy,
meat,
and
alcohol.
Adherence to high diet-quality indices and a prudent/
healthy dietary pattern was associated with a reduced
risk of overall mortality ([diet-quality indices: RR, 0.74;
95%CI, 0.60–0.90; I2 ¼ 6%] [prudent/healthy dietary
pattern: RR, 0.76; 95%CI, 0.60–0.95; I2 ¼ 4%]) among
breast cancer survivors. In contrast, high adherence to a
Western

pattern

Subgroup analyses for adjustment factors and
effect measures
Overall, 71% (for diet-quality indices/dietary patterns),
29% (for foods), and 32% (for beverages) of the
included studies were adjusted for cancer stage and
treatment. A subgroup analysis of only these studies
confirmed the primary results that showed associations
of diet-quality indices and dietary patterns with overall
mortality and cancer recurrence as well as the associ-
ation between alcohol intake and cancer recurrence. On
the other hand, the significant associations between
vegetable and alcohol intake and overall mortality
shown in the main analysis could not be confirmed
(data not shown). Additionally, a subgroup analysis that
included only studies that reported hazard ratios as
effect estimates (96 of 112 studies) was performed.
All results of the main analysis could be confirmed ex-
cept the significant inverse association between adher-
ence to a prudent/healthy dietary pattern and overall
mortality (data not shown).
Small-study effects and publication bias
The Egger’s linear regression test was performed for
overall mortality as well as for the following exposures:
pre- and postdiagnosis intakes of fruits, vegetables,
meat, and alcohol. There was no evidence of small-
study effects of alcohol intake (P ¼ 0.716) on risk of
cancer recurrence or of fruit intake (P ¼ 0.112), vege-
table intake (P ¼ 0.266), dairy intake (P ¼ 0.961), or

 meat intake (P ¼ 0.520) on overall mortality. However,
a potential risk of bias for alcohol consumption
(P ¼ 0.002) and overall mortality was observed.
The funnel plots for associations between risk of
overall mortality and intakes of fruit, vegetable, dairy,
and meat indicate little asymmetry, and the plot for al-
cohol intake indicates moderate asymmetry, suggesting
that small-study effects cannot be completely excluded
as a factor of influence in the present meta-analysis (see
Figures S29–S34 in the Supporting Information online).
Assessment of the contour-enhanced funnel plots sug-
gests that the asymmetry observed is more likely caused
by factors other than publication bias (Figures S35–S40
in the Supporting Information online).
DISCUSSION
In summary, higher diet-quality indices and prudent/
healthy
dietary
patterns
were
associated
with
a
decreased risk of mortality in cancer survivors, whereas
Western dietary patterns resulted in the opposite out-
come. The food groups of vegetables and fish were
associated with lower mortality, while alcohol con-
sumption was associated with higher mortality. In
breast cancer survivors, higher adherence to diet-
quality indices and prudent/healthy dietary patterns
were associated with a decreased risk of overall mortal-
ity, but higher fruit and vegetable intakes were not.
Similarly, Western dietary patterns were associated with
increased risk of mortality in breast cancer and colorec-
tal cancer survivors, but meat consumption was not.
The number of studies assessing cancer recurrence was
low, but 1 study suggests that a Western dietary pattern
is associated with an increased risk of cancer recurrence
among colorectal cancer survivors.38 Finally, consump-
tion of alcoholic beverages was associated with an
increased risk of cancer recurrence. This association
was also seen among breast cancer survivors and in
postdiagnosis alcohol intake.
With increasing numbers of cancer patients, a
growing willingness of patients to participate in
check-up screenings, and technical improvements in
diagnostic and therapeutic tools, it is reasonable to
speculate that the number of cancer survivors will in-
crease.1,2,42 In this context, lifestyle measures will

 gain importance because they represent an option for
patients to make self-controlled decisions. In add-
ition, a switch to a healthier lifestyle can be expected
to have benefits even if the lifestyle change takes place
after the onset of disease. It is thus critical to provide
evidence-based recommendations for cancer patients
to prevent unsuitable or even deleterious lifestyle
practices in this population.
Classification of the various dietary indices and
patterns into their respective components results in a
number of food groups. The constituents of these food
groups might, at least in part, explain the biochemical
mechanisms by which the dietary matrices affect tumor
pathogenesis. For example, dietary patterns associated
with beneficial effects are regularly high in antioxidants
(eg, a prudent or healthy pattern high in olive oil, fruits
and vegetables, and fish contains phenolic compounds,
flavonoids, and n-3 fatty acids) or dietary fiber. On the
other hand, a Western diet is high in food groups with
potentially detrimental ingredients, eg, red and pro-
cessed meats, which contain nitrite and nitrate or
proinflammatory fatty acids.43 High consumption of
fruit, vegetables, fish, and whole-grain products has
usually been associated with a reduced risk of chronic
diseases,44–47 while abundant consumption of red meat
was associated with poor outcomes of colorectal can-
cer.48 Inconsistent results have been reported for dairy
product consumption and risk of prostate cancer, pre-
sumably due to differences in the type of product and
source of calcium.49 Consumption of alcoholic bever-
ages has been reported to be associated with increased
incidence rates of cancers of the mouth, larynx, phar-
ynx, esophagus, liver, and colon/rectum as well as with
pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer.50
Another distinctive feature of this systematic re-
view is the separate evaluation of postdiagnosis sub-
groups whenever a sufficient amount of data was
available. With respect to overall mortality, subgroup
analyses confirmed the main results (pre- and postdiag-
nosis results combined) obtained for diet-quality indi-
ces, prudent/healthy dietary patterns, and Western
dietary patterns. This shows that the overall results
(pre-and postcancer exposures combined) can be used
to support lifestyle changes after a diagnosis of cancer.
This review has several strengths (inclusion of a
large number of studies and patients, focus on cancer
survivors, analyses of postdiagnosis data and cancer re-
currence), as well some limitations. The present ana-
lyses are based exclusively on cohort studies. Cohort
study designs have disadvantages such as unproven
across-group gradients in intake because of bias in diet-
ary estimates and confounding caused by other risk fac-
tors.51,52 Sometimes, the number of studies was rather
small (especially for studies of cancer recurrence,
specific cancer sites, and postdiagnosis dietary assess-
ment). Independent of the power of individual studies,
there was – to some extent – high heterogeneity be-
tween the different studies (see I2 values in Tables 1 and
2). This can be explained by several reasons, such as dif-
ferences in sex and age of participants; time point of
diagnosis; types of cancer; and diet-quality indices.
The fact that different diet-quality indices were
summarized into one category might pose a problem,
particularly since some of these indices are not assessed
by standardized methods (eg, different scores for adher-
ence to a Mediterranean diet). However, all of these in-
dices rely on a combination of potentially protective
food groups. It is therefore unlikely that the benefit
indicated by the resulting effect estimate is attenuated
by a single detrimental index. Special attention might
be required for the Mediterranean diet, which was
shown to exert favorable effects on tumor incidence
and mortality in a number of studies.7 Usually, how-
ever, the highest scores for adherence to this type of
diet can only be obtained with moderate alcohol con-
sumption. Given the inconsistent results of studies
investigating the effects of moderate alcohol intake on
cancer,53,54 recommending alcohol consumption even
in small quantities might not be sensible.
An important distinction of the studies is the point
during the course of disease at which diet was meas-
ured. Most of the included studies analyzed the prediag-
nosis diet. However, the potential of the postdiagnosis
diet to improve survival is of particular interest to can-
cer survivors.
The development of tumors on different locations
is a highly heterogeneous process, and even the patho-
genesis of cancer at the same site can vary considerably.
Heterogeneity in study design and participant charac-
teristics made it especially difficult to identify clinical
factors with an important impact on survival and cancer
recurrence when various studies were synthesized. The
stage of cancer diagnosis has been recognized as an im-
portant factor of disease progression. Patients with
tumors diagnosed at an earlier stage show higher sur-
vival rates.55,56 The treatment method and type of hos-
pital can also greatly influence the outcome.57 Similarly,
age and comorbidity could also be relevant predictors
of survival in some types of cancer.58 Nevertheless,
most studies included in the present analyses adjusted
at least for age, tumor stage, and treatment method.
Despite the advantages offered by a large number
of studies and cancer occurrences, different populations
are exposed to different potential risks and/or protective
factors. Likewise, dietary habits and dietary patterns dif-
fer between populations. In the present analysis, most
of the data summarized are from studies of US popula-
tions (55 studies), followed by studies of European

 populations (33 studies) and Asian populations (21
studies), with the remaining 9 studies conducted in
populations in Canada, Australia, or other countries).
With a higher proportion of US populations and an
underrepresentation of other populations, such as those
from South America and Africa, the results of this re-
view were weighted more heavily toward the US popu-
lation. Furthermore, sociopolitical factors might have
an effect on outcome, too. For instance, the health in-
surance system can be a predicting factor for the stage
at which cancer is diagnosed and the treatment options
available.59
CONCLUSION
This systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort
studies suggests that adherence to a healthy dietary pat-
tern (assessed predominantly prior to cancer diagnosis)
is inversely associated with overall mortality, whereas
an unhealthy Western dietary pattern is positively asso-
ciated with risk of overall mortality among cancer sur-
vivors. More research is warranted to assess the role of
postdiagnosis diet in cancer survival and site-specific
cancer recurrence.
