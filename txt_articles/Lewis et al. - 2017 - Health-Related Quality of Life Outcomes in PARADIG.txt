ORIGINAL ARTICLE
BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure and reduced ejection 
fraction have impaired health-related quality of life (HRQL) with 
variable responses to therapies that target mortality and heart failure 
hospitalizations. In PARADIGM-HF trial (Prospective Comparison of ARNI 
[Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitor] With ACEI [Angiotensin-
Converting–Enzyme Inhibitor] to Determine Impact on Global Mortality 
and Morbidity in Heart Failure), sacubitril/valsartan reduced morbidity 
and mortality compared with enalapril. Another major treatment goal 
is to improve HRQL. Given improvements in mortality with sacubitril/
valsartan, this analysis provides comprehensive assessment of impact of 
therapy on HRQL in survivors only.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients (after run-in phase) completed 
disease-specific HRQL using Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire 
(KCCQ) at randomization, 4 month, 8 month, and annual visits. Changes 
in KCCQ scores were calculated using repeated measures analysis 
of covariance model that adjusted for treatment and baseline values 
(principal efficacy prespecified at 8 months). Among the 8399 patients 
enrolled in PARADIGM-HF, 7623 (91%) completed KCCQ scores at 
randomization with complete data at 8 months for 6881 patients (90% 
of baseline). At 8 months, sacubitril/valsartan group noted improvements 
in both KCCQ clinical summary score (+0.64 versus −0.29; P=0.008) 
and KCCQ overall summary score (+1.13 versus −0.14; P<0.001) in 
comparison to enalapril group and significantly less proportion of patients 
with deterioration (≥5 points decrease) of both KCCQ scores (27% 
versus 31%; P=0.01). Adjusted change scores demonstrated consistent 
improvements in sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril through 
36 months.
CONCLUSIONS: Change scores in KCCQ clinical summary scores and 
KCCQ overall summary scores were better in patients treated with 
sacubitril/valsartan compared with those treated with enalapril, with 
consistency in most domains, and persist during follow-up beyond 8 
months. These findings demonstrate that sacubitril/valsartan leads to 
better HRQL in surviving patients with heart failure.

H
ealth-related quality of life (HRQL) is a key tar-
get of therapy in the management of patients 
with chronic heart failure (HF).1 The HRQL of 
HF patients is more impaired than age-matched pa-
tients without chronic illnesses and those with other 
comorbidities,2 and HRQL perceptions are predictive 
of future risk for morbidity and mortality.3,4 For many 
patients with HF, in addition to prolonging life, improv-
ing HRQL is important.5 Given this focus on HRQL by 
both patients and clinicians, it is relevant to determine 
the impact of novel interventions on these important 
patient-reported outcomes.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have 
been the standard of care for management of patients 
with HF with reduced ejection fraction because of 
improved survival and reduced hospitalizations for HF.6 
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers have 
variable long-term effect on HRQL.2,7,8 Neprilysin is a neu-
tral endopeptidase that facilitates breakdown of natri-
uretic and other vasoactive peptides. Inhibition of this 
enzyme provides higher endogenous levels of vasoactive 
peptides, including natriuretic peptides, which may pro-
mote several changes that could improve HRQL.9 Sacubi-
tril/valsartan combines the neprilysin inhibitor, sacubitril, 
with the angiotensin receptor blocker, valsartan, to mini-
mize the risk of serious angioedema previously seen with 
drugs that act to inhibit both neprilysin and ACE. The 
PARADIGM-HF trial (Prospective Comparison of ARNI 
[Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin Inhibitor] With ACEI 
[Angiotensin-Converting–Enzyme Inhibitor] to Deter-
mine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart 
Failure) demonstrated that sacubitril/valsartan was supe-
rior to enalapril with regards to reduction in cardiovas-
cular death, HF hospitalizations, and all-cause death.10 
Sacubitril/valsartan also prevented the clinical progres-
sion of HF in surviving patients and risk of sudden cardiac 
death.11,12 This article provides a comprehensive analysis 
of HRQL in PARADIGM-HF, a key prespecified secondary 
outcome measure.9 The principal objective of this analy-
sis was to determine whether sacubitril/valsartan was 
superior to enalapril on HRQL changes at 8 months. Sec-
ondary objective was to provide an assessment of long-
term HRQL changes beyond 8 months.
METHODS
The details of PARADIGM-HF have been previously pub-
lished.9,10 Briefly, HF patients ≥18 years of age with New York 
Heart Association (NYHA) class II, III, or IV functional capac-
ity, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40%, and either 
a plasma BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) >150 pg/mL or 
NT-proBNP (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide) >600 
pg/mL or a hospitalization for HF within past 12 months were 
eligible to be enrolled. Patients already taking ACE inhibitors 
or angiotensin receptor blockers were eligible if they were 
taking a daily dose equivalent to enalapril 10 mg and were 
on stable dose of β-blocker for a minimum of 4 weeks. Key 
exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypotension, systolic 
blood pressure <100 mm 
Hg at screening, estimated glomer-
ular filtration rate <30 mL/(min 1.73 m2), history of angio-
edema, or potassium >5.2 mmol/L. Eligible patients were 
entered (in a single blinded fashion) into a run-in phase where 
they took enalapril 10 mg twice daily for 2 weeks followed 
by sacubitril/valsartan 100 mg twice daily initially followed by 
200 mg twice daily for a 4- to 6-week period. Patients with-
out significant intolerances to either drug were randomized 
in 1:1 ratio to either enalapril 10 mg twice daily or sacubitril/
valsartan 200 mg twice daily in a double-blinded fashion. The 
primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or 
hospitalization for HF. The study was approved by an institu-
tional review committee and informed consent was obtained.
Quality of Life Outcome Measures
The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) was 
used as the HRQL instrument in PARADIGM-HF. The KCCQ 
WHAT IS NEW?
• This study reports the primary quality of life out-
comes for PARADIGM-HF trial (Prospective Com-
parison of ARNI [Angiotensin Receptor–Neprilysin 
Inhibitor] With ACEI [Angiotensin-Converting–
Enzyme Inhibitor] to Determine Impact on Global 
Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure), the larg-
est pharmacological trial conducted in patients 
with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction.
• Sacubitril/valsartan improves health-related quality 
of life in comparison to enalapril by 4 months after 
randomization, and these improvements persisted 
throughout 36 months.
• There was a consistent effect of sacubitril/valsartan 
across all 8 quality of life domains, which is not 
typically seen in pharmacological interventions.
• Patients who were admitted to hospital have signifi-
cant declines in the quality of life, but the severity of 
the decline was attenuated with sacubitril/valsartan.
WHAT ARE THE CLINICAL 
IMPLICATIONS?
• Improving quality of life is an important stand-alone 
target of therapy for heart failure patients, and it is 
linked to increased risk for morbidity and mortality.
• Using sacubitril/valsartan improves quality of life to 
the same magnitude that was seen with cardiac 
resynchronization therapy in the MADIT-CRT study 
(Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation 
Trial–Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy).
• Several well-defined risk factors (such as higher 
body mass index and prevalent comorbid condi-
tions) were associated with increased risk for wors-
ening quality of life.
• Clinicians should consider monitoring quality of 
life in clinical practice among these higher risk 
patients.

is a 23-item, widely used, self-administered, disease-specific 
HRQL instrument that is valid in HF and has excellent psy-
chometric properties, including reliability and responsive-
ness.13 The 8 domains include physical limitation, symptom 
stability, symptom frequency, symptom burden, total symp-
tom score, HRQL, self-efficacy, and social limitations. In addi-
tion, there is the KCCQ clinical summary score (KCCQ-CS) 
and KCCQ overall summary score (KCCQ-OS) that captures 
the overall health status of the patient. KCCQ-CS captures 
physical limitation and total symptom scores and KCCQ-OS 
captures physical limitation, total symptom score, HRQL, and 
social limitation scores. Each domain and summary score is 
scaled from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better 
HRQL and a clinically meaningful difference established as 
5 points.14,15 KCCQ was administered in 38 of the 46 coun-
tries, excluding countries without validated versions of the 
instrument.
KCCQ was administered at the time of randomization, 
which was after the run-in phase, and could have occurred 
between 5 and 10 weeks postenrollment and served as base-
line visit. In addition, KCCQ was measured at 4 months, 8 
months, 12 months, and annually thereafter through final 
visit. To minimize bias introduced by death with a resultant 
healthier cohort, the primary HRQL efficacy time point was at 
the 8-month follow-up visit.9
Statistical Analysis
Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the HRQL 
subset were compared with those who were not enrolled 
using descriptive statistics with means (standard deviation) 
and medians (first and third quartiles) for continuous vari-
ables (t test and Mann–Whitney test) and numbers and 
percentage for categorical variables (χ2 and Mann–Whitney 
test). Among the patients in the HRQL subset, differences in 
patient baseline characteristics were assessed by randomiza-
tion arm.
The KCCQ-CS and the KCCQ-OS served as the prin-
cipal HRQL scores based on their use in other large HF tri-
als.4,16 The principal efficacy analysis was the change score 
between baseline and 8-month visit. The treatment effect 
of sacubitril/valsartan in comparison to enalapril on change 
KCCQ-CS and KCCQ-OS was compared using repeated mea-
sure analysis of covariance, and the difference was estimated 
using least squares mean, adjusted for baseline KCCQ score 
(P<0.05 is significant). Patients who died or did not complete 
the 8-month KCCQ score were excluded from the principal 
analysis.

Several secondary analyses were performed. First, the 
between-treatment effects of sacubitril/valsartan versus enal-
april on KCCQ scores (including the 8 domains) were assessed 
through 36-month visit using analysis of covariance, adjust-
ing for baseline values. Next, the proportion of patients with 
clinically meaningful changes in KCCQ-OS and KCCQ-CS 
scores was calculated at 8 months. Patients were classified 
as improved (KCCQ change score ≥5 point increase com-
pared with baseline), stable (KCCQ change score between 5 
and −5), or declined (KCCQ change score ≥5 point decrease 
compared with baseline), and P for trend was calculated. 
Next, the clinical factors that were independently associated 
with KCCQ-OS and KCCQ-CS change scores at 8 months 
were assessed from candidate variables and were entered 
using a forward (P<0.05) and backwards (P<0.10) stepwise 
selection procedure. Each predictive multivariate model was 
performed with and without NYHA classification given the 
overlap between NYHA and HRQL. Finally, the association of 
a hospitalization for HF on KCCQ-OS and KCCQ-CS change 
scores over 8 months were assessed. Patients were stratified 
based on presence or absence of confirmed HF hospitalization 
(adjudicated by central end point committee) between ran-
domization and 8 months. Overall change scores in KCCQ-OS 
and KCCQ-CS as well as between-treatment differences of 
change scores were assessed using analysis of covariance.
A sensitivity analysis was performed in which KCCQ scores 
were imputed with a score of 0 for all subsequent visits that 
occurred after the patient died to account for the imbalance 
of death during follow-up between the 2 treatment arms. 
The treatment effect of sacubitril/valsartan in comparison to 
enalapril on change in KCCQ-CS and KCCQ-OS was then 
compared using repeated measure analysis of covariance at 
8 months.
RESULTS
Among the 8399 patients enrolled in PARADIGM-HF, 
7623 (91%) in 38 countries completed KCCQ scores 
at randomization. The baseline characteristics of the 
patients who completed the KCCQ were different than

the 776 patients who did not complete KCCQ (Table 1). 
The characteristics of the patients who did not complete 
KCCQ include younger age, lower body mass index, 
less comorbid illnesses, higher percentage of women, 
and higher proportion from Asia Pacific region. Among 
patients who completed KCCQ, the patient character-
istics in the 2 treatment groups were similar (Table 2). 
Compared with enalapril, the mean baseline KCCQ-CS 
scores (76.6±19 versus 75.3±19; P=0.004) and KCCQ-
OS scores (73.5±20 versus 72.3±19; P=0.007) were 
higher in sacubitril/valsartan groups. The overall com-
pletion rate decreased to 90% at 8 months, 87% at 12 
months, 61% at 24 months, and 29% at 36 months 
(Figure 1; Table I in the Data Supplement). The distri-
bution of KCCQ scores are skewed toward the right 
(Figure 2).
At 8 months, the difference in change scores favored 
the patients in sacubitril/valsartan group in both KCCQ-
CS score (+0.64 versus −0.29; P=0.008) and KCCQ-OS 
score (+1.13 versus −0.14; P<0.001) in comparison to 
those in enalapril group (Table 3). The patients in the 
sacubitril/valsartan group also noted improvements in all 
domains of KCCQ, with an exception of symptom stabil-
ity with a 2.9-point decline (Table 3); notably, the enala-
pril group had a 4.3-point decline in that domain. In 
contrast, patients in the enalapril arm noted declines in 
most domains. There were consistent improvements in 
KCCQ-CS and KCCQ-OS scores in the sacubitril/valsar-
tan group (in comparison to enalapril) for almost every 
subsequent visit point through 36 months (Table 4). 
At 8 months, the proportion of patients with clinically 
meaningful improvements in KCCQ-OS scores was sig-
nificantly greater for sacubitril/valsartan group than for 
enalapril group (35% versus 33%), and the proportion 
with deterioration was less for sacubitril/valsartan (27% 
versus 31%; Table IIa and IIb in the Data Supplement).

In a multivariable model, several clinical factors 
were independently associated with deteriorations in 
both KCCQ-OS and KCCQ-CS scores, including higher 
body mass index, higher NT-proBNP, NYHA functional 
class III/IV, female sex, and history of myocardial infarc-
tion, atrial fibrillation, and diabetes mellitus (Table 5). 
Conversely, patients enrolled in Latin America and 
Asia noted improvements in these scores. Randomiza-
tion to sacubitril/valsartan remained an independent 
predictor of improvements in KCCQ-OS and KCCQ-
CS scores after adjustment for these factors. With an 
exception of older age, all factors were associated 
with changes in KCCQ scores with and without NYHA 
in the model.

A total of 305 (4.4%) patients were hospitalized for 
HF between baseline and 8 months. The patients with-
out a HF hospitalization had modest improvements in 
KCCQ scores in both sacubitril/valsartan and enalapril 
(Table 6). In contrast, patients with HF hospitalization 
had significant decreases in KCCQ scores at 8 months. 
In comparison to enalapril group, patients randomized 
to sacubitril/valsartan had a smaller decline in KCCQ-
OS scores (5.66 point difference; P=0.003) and KCCQ-
CS scores (5.14 difference; P=0.005). There was no 
difference in mean time between HF hospitalization 
and 8-month KCCQ assessment in sacubitril/valsartan 
(−4.0+2.3 months) and enalapril (−4.3+2.6 months) 
groups (P=0.27).
When imputing 0 for death during follow-up, there 
were significant differences favoring sacubitril/valsartan 
for KCCQ-CS, KCCQ-OS, and all 8 domains, with least 
square mean differences ranging from 1.41 to 2.56 
points (Table III in the Data Supplement).
DISCUSSION
In a large, well-treated population with HF with 
reduced ejection fraction, sacubitril/valsartan was supe-
rior to enalapril in improving disease-specific HRQL. The 
principal HRQL end points of KCCQ-CS and KCCQ-OS 
were improved by 4 months, and these improvements 
persisted throughout 36 months. There were statisti-
cally significant differences favoring sacubitril/valsartan 
across all 8 KCCQ domains and extending to 36 months, 
adding further support for the principal findings. There 
was a significant proportion of patients receiving sacu-
bitril/valsartan who noted clinically meaningful changes 
of HRQL, despite all patients receiving the drug during 
the run-in phase. Patients who were hospitalized for HF 
within the first 8 months noted significant deteriora-
tions in KCCQ scores; however, randomization to sacu-
bitril/valsartan attenuated this decline in comparison to 
enalapril.
The KCCQ scores at baseline are much higher 
than those of contemporary cohorts with HF evalu-
ating novel interventions, including ivabradine,4 iron 
replacement,17 coronary artery bypass grafting,16 car-
diac rehabilitation,18 sertraline use for treatment of 
depression,19 and spironolactone.20 This higher score 
likely reflects the unique features of the HRQL com-
ponent of PARADIGM-HF, in that the patients did 
not complete instruments until the time of random-
ization, which occurred after the run-in phase with 
both enalapril and sacubitril/valsartan up to 10 weeks. 
It has been well established that HRQL perceptions 
can improve quickly in a clinical trial setting inde-
pendent of any treatment effect because of poten-
tial extra attention, more intense management, and 
potential optimism for improved outcomes.21,22 This 
higher baseline KCCQ score and prior exposure to 
sacubitril/valsartan possibly impacted the magnitude 
of improvement over time. Despite this limitation, 
randomization to sacubitril/valsartan still was consis-
tently associated with improved HRQL. Despite a com-
parison with an active treatment rather than placebo, 
sacubitril/valsartan had similar magnitude of improve-
ments of the KCCQ change scores as were seen with 
cardiac resynchronization therapy in the MADIT-CRT 
trial (Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation 
Trial–Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy).23
Hospitalizations for HF are associated with increased 
risk for mortality.24,25 Several studies have demonstrat-
ed worse HRQL after patients are discharged from the 
hospital. Sacubitril/valsartan appeared to attenuate the

marked decline in HRQL in comparison to enalapril. It 
is unclear if the decline in HRQL among these patients 
with a HF hospitalization prompted the decision for 
admission or was a consequence of the progression of 
symptomatic HF. The greater magnitude of decline as a 
function of the time between the hospitalization and 
KCCQ assessment suggests that decisions that incorpo-
rate HRQL should be reassessed as patients stabilize in 
the outpatient setting.
There are several characteristics that were associated 
with impaired HRQL at baseline, including older age, 
female sex, higher body mass index, and comorbid ill-
nesses. These variables are complex and may reflect the 
impact of symptom burden, patient perception, and 
disease severity on their overall sense of well-being.26 
Several studies have identified many of these factors 
in HF populations.20,27,28 Some of these variables are 
modifiable and should be studied further with targeted 
interventions as we aim to improve HRQL. In the pres-
ent study, there were multiple factors that consistently 
were associated with decreases in KCCQ scores by 8 
months, including higher body mass index, higher NT-
proBNP
, older age, history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes 
mellitus, and higher NYHA class. This study expands on 
the study by Allen et al27 that identified diabetes mel-
litus, older age, and arrhythmias as predictors of future 
unfavorable HRQL. Comorbidities affect self-care man-
agement and result in worse HRQL.26 Exploration of 
these factors may identify a population who may be 
targeted for specific therapies directed specifically for 
preservation/improvements of HRQL and discussions 
about goals of care/advanced directives. Nevertheless, 
randomization to sacubitril/valsartan was an indepen-
dent predictor of improved perceptions after adjusting 
for all other variables.

There are several limitations that should be highlight-
ed. First, the KCCQ was initially measured after the run-
in phase, which potentially resulted in a higher baseline 
score. Second, although the overall effect size might 
seem small, there are limited data assessing the clinical 
meaningfulness of change scores in patients who start 
with relatively good perceptions of their HRQL. Given 
the lack of validity of this instrument for some countries, 
we have limited experience of the impact of therapy in 
some parts of Asia. There may be >1 language in a given 
country, and thus, we cannot cross-validate responses by 
language. Nevertheless, KCCQ is the most well-validated 
instrument in HF, and the consistency of improvements 
of KCCQ scores across all domains suggest that patients 
can enjoy an improved survival and HRQL in comparison 
to ACE inhibitors, the long-standing standard of care.
CONCLUSIONS
In patients with HF with reduced ejection fraction who 
are well managed, HRQL specific to HF is significantly 
improved with sacubitril/valsartan compared with enal-
april.
