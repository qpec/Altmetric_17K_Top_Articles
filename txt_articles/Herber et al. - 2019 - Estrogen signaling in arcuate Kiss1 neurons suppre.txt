Central estrogen signaling coordinates energy expenditure, reproduction, and in concert with
peripheral estrogen impacts skeletal homeostasis in females. Here, we ablate estrogen
receptor alpha (ERα) in the medial basal hypothalamus and find a robust bone phenotype
only in female mice that results in exceptionally strong trabecular and cortical bones, whose
density surpasses other reported mouse models. Stereotaxic guided deletion of ERα in
the arcuate nucleus increases bone mass in intact and ovariectomized females, confirming
the central role of estrogen signaling in this sex-dependent bone phenotype. Loss of ERα in
kisspeptin (Kiss1)-expressing cells is sufficient to recapitulate the bone phenotype, identifying
Kiss1 neurons as a critical node in this powerful neuroskeletal circuit. We propose that this
newly-identified female brain-to-bone pathway exists as a homeostatic regulator diverting
calcium and energy stores from bone building when energetic demands are high. Our work
reveals a previously unknown target for treatment of age-related bone disease.

 T
he sex steroid hormone estrogen is critical for balancing
energy allocation and expenditure to ensure maximal
reproductive
fitness.
Peripheral
estrogen
is
also
an
important regulator of skeletal homeostasis. In male and female
rodents, circulating 17β-estradiol (E2) actively stimulates can-
cellous bone formation through estrogen receptor alpha (ERα)1,2.
Indeed, chronic administration of E2 to intact or ovariectomized
(OVX) females can lead to significant increases in trabecular bone
mass3,4. On the other hand, central estrogen signaling appears to
negatively impact female bone metabolism as suggested by the
modest increase in trabecular bone mass following central loss of
ERα using the brain-specific, but problematic Nestin-Cre5,6.
Trabecular and cortical bone volume are also modestly elevated
after deleting ERα using the non-inducible and developmentally
promiscuous POMC-Cre7,8. In both of these mouse models
(Esr1Nestin-Cre and Esr1POMC-Cre), the elevated bone mass in
females vanishes following ovariectomy, underscoring the essen-
tial role of gonadal sex-steroids in generating and/or maintaining
these bone phenotypes. Independent of estrogen signaling,
manipulating NPY or AgRP ARC neurons also modestly influ-
ences bone metabolism, at least in male mice9,10.
Within the medial basal hypothalamus (MBH) ERα is highly
enriched in two anatomically and functionally distinct neuronal
clusters, the arcuate nucleus (ARC) and the ventral lateral region of
the ventromedial hypothalamus (VMHvl). Estrogen signaling in the
female MBH promotes a catabolic energy state by regulating distinct
aspects of energy balance11–13. Indeed, conditional mouse models in
which ERα is deleted in some, but not all, ARC or VMHvl neurons
suggest that these two estrogen-responsive brain modules separately
regulate energy balance11,12. Partial loss or pharmacological block-
ade of ERα in the VMH lowers energy expenditure by decreasing
brown adipose tissue (BAT) thermogenesis12,14 and lowering phy-
sical activity11. Within the ARC, ERα is expressed in multiple cell
types, each expressing a signature neuropeptide or neurotransmitter
system. Estrogen signaling in the POMC lineage15, is thought to
limit food intake as inferred from deletion of ERα using the POMC-
Cre (Esr1POMC-Cre)12. Most kisspeptin (Kiss1) neurons in the ARC
also express ERα. Kisspeptin itself regulates puberty and fertility in
both male and female mice16,17, as well as in humans18. However,
ERα signaling dynamically regulates Kiss1 ARC neurons by silen-
cing Kiss1 expression and restraining the onset of female, but not
male pubertal development19. Deleting ERα using different Kiss1-
Cre alleles upregulates Kiss120, accelerates pubertal onset in female
mice19, and increases both inhibitory and excitatory firing of Kiss1
ARC neurons21,22. While ERα is absent in most but not all NPY/
AgRP neurons23,24, these nutritional sensing neurons project to and
inhibit Kiss1 ARC neurons25.
Given the cellular complexity of estrogen-responsive neurons
in the ARC (and VMHvl), we leveraged the Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mouse
model, in which all ERα in the MBH is eliminated via Nkx2-1-
driven Cre recombinase11 to ascertain how ERα in the MBH
influences energy expenditure, food intake, reproduction and
possibly skeletal homeostasis. We then confirmed that any
observed phenotypes were neural in origin using stereotaxic
delivery of AAV2-Cre to acutely ablate ERα in either the ARC or
VMHvl in adult female mice. We found that eliminating ERα
in the ARC resulted in a robust and sex-dependent high
mass bone phenotype. Importantly, we go on to define Kiss1
neurons as the critical estrogen-responsive subpopulation in the
ARC for promoting this remarkable, robust bone mass in female
mice.
Results
Altered energetic homeostasis in female Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mice. In
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mice, ERα is efficiently eliminated in the entire
MBH in both male and female brains, including the ARC and
VMHvl, but is largely maintained in the anteroventral periven-
tricular nucleus (AVPV), preoptic area, nucleus tractus solitarius,
and medial amygdala (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Figure 1A).
Peripheral tissues including the lung, thyroid, BAT, and pituitary
maintained Esr1 expression in mutant females compared to wild-
type females (Supplementary Figure 1B). Deleting ERα in the
MBH depleted primordial follicles, and led to female infertility,
and uterine imbibition (Supplementary Figures 1C–E). Mutant
females displayed a small but significant increase in body weight,
which was less robust than reported for Esr1POMC-Cre12, whereas
body weights for mutant males decreased (Fig. 1b). Food intake
was unchanged in both sexes (Fig. 1c).
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females exhibited a sex-dependent change in
energy balance that was entirely absent in male mice. The lean
mass of mutant females was significantly higher than control
floxed (Esr1fl/fl) littermates (Fig. 1d) and was accompanied by
decreased physical activity during the dark phase (Fig. 1e and
Supplementary Figure 2C). Although highly significant, increased
lean mass observed in mutant females failed to change their
overall mobility and muscle strength as measured by rotarod and
grip strength assays, respectively (Supplementary Figure 2D, E).
Blunted BAT thermogenesis was observed in mutant females
as evidenced by whitening of BAT and decreased Ucp1 levels;
circulating catecholamines were not lower (Fig. 1f and Supple-
mentary Figures 2F, G). Serum leptin levels were also unchanged
(Fig. 1g). Thus, these data reveal that central estrogen signaling in
this brain region promotes a sex-dependent negative energy state
in females in the absence of any change in feeding behavior. This
unexpected finding implies that the hyperphagia reported for
Esr1POMC-Cre mice might result from selective or ectopic activity
of POMC-Cre in non-ARC neurons8.
Elevated bone density in female Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mice. Strikingly,
bone mineral density (BMD), as determined by dual X-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA), was significantly elevated in Esr1Nkx2-
1Cre females, but not males (Fig. 1h), consistent with the sex-
dependent significant increases in lean mass. Further analyses of
femoral bone, using three-dimensional high resolution micro-
computed tomography (µCT), confirmed a striking increase in
trabecular bone mass and microarchitecture in older Esr1Nkx2-1Cre
females compared to control littermates (Fig. 2a). Mutant females
exhibited a ~500% increase in fractional bone volume in the distal
femur, rising from 11 to 52 bone volume/tissue volume (BV/TV)
(%) (Fig. 2a). A similar trend was found for vertebral bone
(Supplementary Figure 3A). Accompanying structural changes
included increases in trabecular number and thickness and
reduced trabecular separation (Fig. 2a). Mutant females also
exhibited a significant increase in cortical thickness but a modest
decrease in tibial and femoral length (Supplementary Figure 3B).
This striking skeletal phenotype is sex-dependent, as no changes
in bone mass were observed in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre males (Fig. 2b).
Further, unlike the 20% increase in femoral bone mass reported
for Esr1POMC-Cre and Esr1Nestin-Cre mice that vanishes in OVX
females, bone parameters in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females remained ele-
vated 5 weeks following ovariectomy (Fig. 2c). In fact, no sig-
nificant changes in serum sex steroids (E2, T) were detected in
4–5-week-old mutant females when the high bone mass pheno-
type is clearly present (Fig. 2d, f). The percentage of bone loss in
OVX female mutants is higher than their wild-type littermates
(72% versus 43%), consistent with the finding by others that

 in juvenile Esr1Nkx2-1Cre males by castration failed to elevate their
bone mass, implying that male gonadal hormones are unable to
account for the lack of high bone mass in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre males
(Supplementary Figure 3D). These data imply that while the high
BMD in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females is partially maintained by ovarian
steroids, elevated levels of circulating E2 or pituitary hormones
are
not
the primary
drivers
of
this
sex-dependent
bone
phenotype.
Mechanical bone strength tests established that femora and L5
vertebrae in older Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females were substantially
stronger than controls (Fig. 2e). The dense skeletal phenotype
in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females observed in femoral and vertebral
trabecular bone emerged early and continued to persist in older
females (54–74 weeks), exceeding values found for OVX mutant
females (Fig. 2c, f, g). Thus, trabecular bone, which becomes
porous and more fragile in osteoporosis, is remarkably dense and
durable in older Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females. Upregulation of bone
metabolism in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females was not associated with
ectopic Cre expression in femoral bone (Supplementary Figure
3F). Representative H&E stained femoral bone sections from
juvenile female mice illustrate the striking increase in bone
density accompanied by a marked decrease in bone marrow space
(Fig. 2h). Despite a narrowing of the bone marrow cavity, no
differences in spleen weights were observed in mutant females
compared to controls at all ages examined (Supplementary
Figure 3E).

 Elevated bone formation rate in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre female femurs.
Young Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females showed a significant increase in bone
formation rate (BFR) and mineralized surface (Fig. 3a, b),
demonstrating robust osteoblast function. Both the mineral
apposition rate (MAR) and normalized osteoclast number were
unaffected in mutant bone, implying that significant decreases in
osteoclast number and function are unable to account for the
high bone mass phenotype (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig-
ure 3G). A similar trend was observed in older Esr1Nkx2-1Cre
females after maximal bone density is achieved (Supplementary
Figure 3G). Based on transcriptional profiling, gene changes in
mutant bone marrow included upregulation of BMP signaling
and osteoblast differentiation/ossification (Supplementary Data-
set 1) with a concomitant elevation of Sp7 (Osterix), Wnt10b,
Bglap (Osteocalcin), Sost, and osteoclast markers in mutant bone
(Fig. 3c, d). While Runx2 was unchanged in mutant bone
chips harvested from long bones minus endplates, this osteoblast
precursor marker was modestly increased in female bone marrow
when examined at 4.5 weeks of age (Fig. 3d). Markers for
chondrocyte differentiation (Sox927) and those that would indi-
cate a change in sympathetic tone28,29, were unchanged (Sup-
plementary Table 1 and Dataset 1), whereas markers of interferon
(IFN) signaling (Oas2, Oas3, Itga11, Gbp6, and Gbp4) and carti-
lage (Cola2) were elevated (Fig. 3c, Supplementary Figure 3H and
Dataset 1), consistent with the estrogen-independent increases in
bone mass following interferon-gamma treatment30. Collectively,
these data suggest that ablating ERα in the MBH leads to an
expansion of bone marrow stromal cells or adult skeletal stem
cells31, fated for osteoblast differentiation/proliferation that give
rise to mature bone and cartilage.

 Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females arises specifically from loss of ERα signaling
in the brain, stereotaxic delivery of AAV2-Cre was used to elim-
inate ERα in either the VMHvl or the ARC (referred to as
ERαKOVMHvl or ERαKOARC, respectively, Fig. 4a). Adult Esr1fl/fl
females injected with either AAV2-GFP (control) or AAV2-Cre
were evaluated for ERα expression (Supplementary Figures 4A, B).
Successful hits were defined as partial or full loss of ERα on one or
both sides of the VMHvl or ARC. As noted for Esr1Nkx2-1Cre
females, eliminating ERα in the ARC but not the VMHvl fully
recapitulated the significant increase in BMD without changing
food intake or E2, T, Leptin, and uterine weights (Fig. 4b–d and
Supplementary Figure 5A), disentangling the high bone mass
phenotype in ERαKOARC females from changes in these circu-
lating hormones. Strikingly, just 12 weeks postinfection (PI),
ERαKOARC females showed a similar massive elevation in frac-
tional femoral bone volume, which was accompanied by an
increase in trabecular number and thickness and decreased bone
marrow space (Fig. 4e–g), as well as a modest increase in osteo-
protegerin and elevated SOST (Supplementary Figure 5A). Cor-
tical bone thickness was also enhanced without affecting the
cortical perimeter (Fig. 4f and Supplementary Figure 5B).
The impact of viral-mediated deletion of ERα in the ARC
was assessed over time in older OVX females that par-
tially model postmenopausal bone loss. As expected, in vivo
imaging showed that volumetric bone in OVX females dropped
rapidly after ovariectomy, dipping by half from ~11 to 5.6 ± 1.3
SEM %BV/TV for all cohorts. Bone mass declined further to
~3.1 ± 0.9 SEM %BV/TV 5-week PI—the time period required
to achieve complete ERα deletion in the ARC32. While bone
density continued to deteriorate in control groups where ERα
remained intact (GFP or Miss), complete or partial loss of ERα
in the ARC (Hits) resulted in a remarkable ~50% increase in
bone volume 12-week PI despite the mature age (38 weeks)
of these older females (Fig. 4g and Supplementary Figure 4C).
In sum, these data using both intact and older estrogen-
depleted females suggest that the increased bone formation
observed
in
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre
females
is
central
in
origin,
thus supporting the existence of a robust estrogen-sensitive
neuroskeletal circuit.
Altered Kiss1 neuron transcripts in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females. To
assess molecular changes in the ARC that are associated with
upregulation of bone metabolism in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females, tran-
scriptional profiling was performed. Using microdissected female
ARC tissue from controls and mutants, we defined ~180 DEG
significantly changed in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mutants (Fig. 5a, b). Of
those transcripts, 83% overlapped with genes that are known to
be regulated by estrogen (Fig. 5c) as illustrated by loss of Greb1, a
highly responsive ERα gene target33. Strikingly, however, more
than 100 differentially regulated transcripts were distinct from the
well-characterized markers of either POMC or AgRP neurons
(Fig. 5c and Supplementary Dataset 2). Among significantly
downregulated genes, four transcripts are associated with dopa-
minergic neurons: the dopamine transporter Slc6a3 (DAT), the
synaptic vesicle glycoprotein Sv2c, the transcription factor Nr4a2,
and the prolactin receptor Prlr (Fig. 5a). After loss of ERα, Slc6a3
is downregulated in the ARC consistent with Slc6a3 upregulation
by E2 in cultured cells34 (Fig. 5d, e). Accordingly, we find that the
majority of DAT-positive neurons in the dorsal medial ARC
coexpress ERα, by means of an Slc6a3Cre;Tdtomato reporter line
(Fig. 5e). Another triad of DEGs is Kiss1, Pdyn, and Tac2 (Fig. 5b)
that together with the glutamate transporter Slc17a6 define KNDy
(Kisspeptin, Neurokinin B, Dynorphin) ARC neurons35,36. As
expected and based on the dynamic transcriptional repression of
KNDy markers by estrogen20, both Kiss1 and Pdyn are elevated in
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mutants (Fig. 5d).
Deleting ERα signaling in Kiss1 cells elevates bone mass. Given
that the gene signature of KNDy neurons is altered in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre
females, we deleted ERα in Kiss1 cells (Esr1Kiss1-Cre) using a Kiss1-
Cre-GFP knockin allele to ask if we might identify which estrogen-
responsive ARC neurons drive the robust female bone phenotype.
As the majority of Kiss1 neurons share a common lineage with
POMC neurons in development37, we also deleted ERα in POMC
neurons (Esr1POMC-Cre). While ERα was partially ablated in the
Esr1POMC-Cre ARC, we failed to detect a trabecular or cortical bone
phenotype previously reported for Esr1POMC-Cre females7 (Fig. 6a
and Supplementary Figures 6A, B); our negative results could stem

 from strain, dosage or transmission (paternal versus maternal) dif-
ferences. In stark contrast, after confirming loss of ERα in all Kiss1
ARC neurons in Esr1Kiss1-Cre females (Fig. 6b and Supplementary
Figure 6C), both juvenile and older mutant females displayed a
striking increase in bone mass that was easily visualized by the
naked eye (Fig. 6c), with values reaching 88% BV/TV for the distal
femur; mutant L5 vertebrae and cortical bone mass were similarly
affected (Fig. 6d and Supplementary Figure 6D). The striking ele-
vation in bone density in Esr1Kiss1-Cre females exceeded the observed
bone mass in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females at all ages, perhaps reflecting the
narrow versus broad expression of these two different Cre drivers.
Similar to Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mice the bone phenotype is limited to
females and appears to be independent of high E2 levels (Fig. 6d and
Supplementary Figure 6E), consistent with the findings that deleting
ERα with other Kiss1-Cre knockin alleles accelerates pubertal onset
in female mice without altering negative feedback19,38. Although E2
levels were unchanged in juvenile Esr1Kiss1-Cre at 4.5–19 weeks, it is
possible that the higher average volumetric bone mass for the distal
femur observed in Esr1Kiss1-Cre compared to Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females
(79 ± 4.8 versus 52 ± 4.5 %BV/TV) results from the premature
postnatal LH surge, as noted by others19,39. As might be predicted
with extremely dense bone and probable bone marrow failure,
spleen weights and markers of extramedullary hematopoiesis
(indicated by megakaryocytes) increase significantly in females
(Fig. 6e and Supplementary Figure 6F). Taken together, the con-
trasting bone phenotypes observed in Esr1Kiss1-Cre and Esr1POMC-Cre
infer that this female-specific brain-to-bone pathway is mediated by
a subset of Kiss1 neurons that arise independently of the POMC
lineage37. Collectively, our data also suggest that disrupting the
transcriptional output and activity of KNDy neurons breaks a
brain–bone homeostatic axis that would normally restrain anabolic
bone metabolism.
Discussion
Our investigation to understand the complex role of estrogen
signaling in the MBH establishes that ERα-expressing Kiss1 ARC
neurons are central to restraining a powerful brain–bone axis in
female mice. This assertion stems from the sex-dependent, high
bone mass phenotype that emerged from three independent,
intersectional strategies that target central ERα signaling. When
compared with other mouse models that alter bone remodeling,
several prominent features emerge from our results. In particular,
the only model that, to our knowledge, rivals the magnitude of
volumetric bone density increase observed in Esr1Kiss1-Cre and
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females is the sclerostin null (Sost−/−) mouse40,41.
However, the Sost−/− bone phenotype is observed in both sexes
and the connectivity density is substantially lower40. Moreover,
we find that selectively removing ERα in the ARC of older,
estrogen depleted females results in an impressive ~50% increase
in bone density, indicating a potential therapeutic value in
manipulating this female neuroskeletal circuit. Disrupting this
neuroskeletal circuit enhances genetic pathways associated with
osteogenesis and results in fully functional mature bones with
exceptional strength. When considered alongside the well-
established role of peripheral estrogen in the prevention of
bone loss42, our findings illustrate that the same hypothalamic
neurons used to restrain the onset of puberty also inhibit anabolic
bone metabolism in females. We speculate that once this female

 ERα-dependent brain-to-bone pathway is disturbed, energetic
resources are funneled into bone and diverted away from
reproduction and energy expenditure (Fig. 6f).
Kiss1 hypothalamic neurons can be categorized as either KNDy
in the ARC or Kiss1 in the rostral ARC (AVPV). Multiple labs
report that Kiss1 and KNDy subtypes are distinguished by their
neuronal excitability21,22, projections43, and regulatory function of
ERα, including a role of nonclassical, non-ERE action44. At this
juncture, we know that deleting ERα with a Kiss1-Cre knock-in
allele, which will target the ARC and AVPV, as well as other
tissues, triggers an incredibly robust female high bone mass phe-
notype. When coupled with a similar phenotype observed in
ERαKOARC, and the residual ERα expression in the AVPV of
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre females, we reason that it is not Kiss1 AVPV neurons,
but KNDy ARC neurons that regulate this sex-dependent brain-to-
bone connection. Whether there are functionally distinct KNDy
ARC neuronal subpopulations critical for this brain-to-bone
pathway remains to be determined. It is possible that the source
of this brain-to-bone pathway might stem indirectly from KNDy
neurons regulating POMC tone, that then influence bone remo-
deling45. Given that prodynorphin, a marker of KNDy ARC neu-
rons is suppressed by estrogen, but not by tamoxifen46, one might
also speculate that some of the bone-sparing effects of this selective
ERα modulator47 stem from its antagonist activity in the ARC.
The precise neuronal or humoral signals that promote the high
mass
bone
phenotype
in
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre,
Esr1Kiss1-Cre,
and
ERαKOARC females remain to be determined. However, we note
that this phenotype is independent of changes to leptin or E2 and
is not directly influenced by ERα neurons in the VMHvl. In this
respect, our results differ from prior reports linking leptin defi-
ciency to high trabecular bone mass48 via a circuit involving
suppression of serotonergic signaling in the VMH49 or direct
effects of leptin on bone50. Moreover, while lower sympathetic
output in the MBH can lead to mild increases in cortical and
trabecular bone over months51, the high bone density phenotype
in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre and Esr1Kiss1-Cre females arises as early as
4 weeks, and all measured parameters of sympathetic tone (e.g.,
circulating ACTH, catecholamines, markers of changed sympa-
thetic tone in either bone or BAT) are not significantly different
in mutant females (Supplementary Figures 2F, G and Supple-
mentary Figure 3C and Supplementary Table 1). Importantly, the
elevated bone mass in mutant females does not appear to be
caused from impaired bone resorption as no change in tartrate-
resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining was observed in
mutant female femoral bone. That sclerostin, a known repressor
of bone metabolism is elevated in Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mutants implies
that their massive increase in female volumetric bone mass is
independent of sclerostin. Thus, we conclude that the high bone
mass in our mouse models results from activation of a potent
signaling pathway that promotes bone formation by a humoral
mechanism and is initiated in the brain.
Our findings raise an interesting question: why have a female-
specific ERα brain–bone pathway that counteracts the positive
effects of peripheral estrogen on bone remodeling? One clue is
provided by the global role of ERα signaling in the MBH, which is
to allocate energetic resources to initiate and preserve reproduc-
tion. Based on our loss-of-function studies, we conclude that ERα
signaling in MBH neurons regulates energy expenditure in this
way, by promoting locomotion, generating heat via adaptive BAT
thermogenesis, and preserving energy and calcium stores by
preventing excessive bone building, without altering food intake.
It is important to note that the high bone phenotype degrades far
less in older intact mutant females (52% bone loss) compared to
OVX mutant females (75% bone loss), as our data show for
54–74-week-old females. Collectively, these data imply that dis-
rupting the brain-to-bone pathway is unable to counteract fully
the significant bone loss due to estrogen depletion. However,
understanding how Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mutants females are able to
preserve much of their bone during aging is clearly relevant to
future translation of these basic findings. As such, our work

 defines central regulation of bone metabolism, alongside repro-
duction and energy balance, as a fundamental determinant of
female physiology. This estrogen-sensitive neuroskeletal axis is
likely to be relevant during the prepubertal growth spurt in
humans and in late stages of pregnancy, when gonadal steroids
are low or high, respectively.
In the course of our study, we also found that Slc6a3 encoding
DAT is highly responsive to estrogen and marks a subset of dorsal
medial ERα ARC neurons. Although Kiss1 neurons appear to be
sufficient in mediating the central effects of ERα on bone,
defining the contribution of DAT ARC neurons to this circuit
awaits development of better genetic tools. Unfortunately, con-
sistent with earlier studies showing limited efficacy of Slc6a3-Cre
in the hypothalamus52,53, ERα remained intact in DAT + ARC
neurons in Esr1 Slc6a3Cre mice. Because dopaminergic ARC neu-
rons are modulated by Kiss154, it will be of interest to determine
how these two estrogen-responsive ARC modules communicate
to coordinate female bone and energy metabolism before, during,
and after pregnancy.
In
summary,
our
work
reveals
an
unprecedented
sex-
dependent bone phenotype and provides unequivocal proof of
brain-to-bone signaling55. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate
the importance of central estrogen signaling (which exists in a
coregulatory system with peripheral estrogen) in the maintenance
of bone homeostasis in females. Breaking this neuroskeletal
homeostatic circuit in young and old females promotes anabolic
bone metabolism and provides a model for further mechanistic
investigations that might eventually provide opportunities to
counteract age-related osteoporosis in both women and men.
Methods
Mice. The origin of the Esr1fl/fl allele on a 129P2 background and used to generate
Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mice are described in ref. 11 and were maintained on CD-1;129P2
mixed background. Esr1POMC-Cre and Esr1Kiss1-Cre mice were generated by crossing
male mice harboring a single copy of the Pomc-Cre transgene (official allele: Tg
(Pomc1-cre)16Lowl/J) or the Kiss1-Cre-GFP knockin allele to Esr1fl/fl females
(official allele: Esr1tm1Sakh). Pomc-Cre transgenic mice were obtained from C.
Vaisse (UCSF). Esr1POMC-Cre mice were maintained on a mixed FVB/N, CD-1,
129P2, and C57BL/6 genetic background. The knockin Kiss-Cre:GFP (version 2) on

 a C57BL/6 background was a gift from R. Steiner and R. Palmiter (UW). Esr1Kiss1-
Cre mice were maintained on a mixed C57BL/6; CD-1;129P2 genetic background56.
Esr1fl/+;Ai14fl/+;Nkx2-1Cre mice were generated by crossing Esr1fl/+;Ai14fl/fl
reporter females with Esr1lfl/fl; Nkx2-1Cre males. The Slc6a3Cre;Ai9fl/+ reporter line
was a gift from by R. Edwards (UCSF). Primer sequences used for genotyping can
be found in (Supplementary Table 2). For assessment of bone mass in estrogen
depleted OVX females, OVX females, ovariectomy was performed between 8 and
25 weeks. For assessment of bone mass in androgen depleted male mice, mice were
castrated at 3 weeks of age and bone mass was assessed by MicroCT 4 weeks later.
Mice were maintained on a 12 h light/dark cycle with ad libitum access to food and
to standard chow diet (5058; LabDiet, 4% fat). All animal procedures were per-

axes), and rearing (total beam breaks; Z-axis) at 14 min intervals. Food intake for
experiments done with Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mice and female ERαKOVMHvl or ERαKOARC
was determined via CLAMS. Mice were housed in CLAMS for 96 h; the first
24–48 h period of acclimation was not included in analyses. Each experimental
cohort VO2 measurements were standardized to lean mass. All CLAMS analyses in
females were performed in intact animals. EchoMRI were used to measure body
composition. DEXA was used to measure BMD and bone mineral content.
RNA isolation and qPCR. Tissue was collected, cleaned of excess tissue and
homogenized in TRIzol (Invitrogen). RNA was isolated using chloroform extrac-
tion. cDNA was synthesized using the Applied Biosystems High-Capacity cDNA
Reverse Transcription Kit. Whole femur samples were cleaned of excess tissue,
endplates removed, minced and placed in TRIzol. Bone marrow was flushed from
femoral samples using 1% HBSS. RNA was isolated using chloroform extraction for
all tissues. cDNA was synthesized with random hexamer primers with the Affy-
metrix reverse transcriptase kit (Affymetrix). Quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (qPCR) expression analysis in femoral samples was performed using SYBR
Green. Values were normalized to either 36b4, mCyclo, or Gapdh. Sequences for
primer pairs can be found in (Supplementary Table 3).
Rotarod. Age and weight-matched female Esr1fl/fl and Esr1Nkx2-1Cre mice were
tested on a rotating rod (UGO Basile) to assess motor coordination. Prior to data
collection mice were trained on how to hold onto the rotating log. At the time of
measurement, mice were placed on the rotarod and the speed (rotations/min)
gradually increased over a 5-min period. The test ended when the mice fell off the
rotarod. The time in seconds at the moment of release was recorded. Mice were
subjected to 6 trials over 2 days (3 trials/day).
Grip strength. We measured forelimb grip strength using the Grip Strength Meter
(Chatillion, Columbus Instruments, OH, USA). Briefly, prior to data collection,
mice were trained on holding the instrument grids for grip strength measurement.
Animals were held by the tail, directed and allowed to grasp a steel grip gauge with
forelimbs only. After gripping the steel grip gauge, mice were gently and steadily
pulled away until the grip was released. The force measured at time of grip release
was recorded as grip strength. Measurements obtained were calculated as the
average of three measurements.
Immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry was performed on cryosections
(20 µm) collected from brains fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde using standard pro-
cedures. ERα staining used rabbit polyclonal anti-ERα antibody (EMD Millipore,
Billerica, MA cat # C1355) or mouse monoclonal ERα antibody (Abcam, Cam-
bridge cat # 93021) at a dilution of 1:1000 or 1:100, respectively. GFP staining used
anti-GFP antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO cat # NB100-1614) at 1:2500.
Kisspeptin staining used rabbit polyclonal anti-KISS1 at a dilution of 1:200
(Abcam, Cambridge cat # ab19028). Confocal images were taken using a Nikon Ti
inverted fluorescence microscope with CSU-22 spinning disk confocal.
In situ hybridization. Slc6a3 cDNA for in vitro transcription of digoxigenin
(DIG)-labeled riboprobe was generated by PCR amplification (forward primer: 5-
TTCCGAGAGAAACTGGCCTA-3 and reverse primer: 5-TGTGAAGAGCAG
GTGTCCAG-3) from a brain mRNA library. In situ hybridization (ISH) was
performed on 20 μm sections using standard protocols57. The DIG-riboprobe was
hybridized overnight at 65 °C. Following washing and blocking, sections were
incubated overnight with anti-DIG-AP (1:2000) (Roche) at 4 °C. AP signal was
developed using BM Purple (Roche).
Serum measurements. For measurements of E2 or T, nonpolar metabolites from
plasma were extracted in 1 ml of PBS with inclusion of internal standards C12:0
monoalkylglycerol ether (MAGE) (10 nmol, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and pen-
tadecanoic acid (10 nmol, Sigma-Aldrich) and 3 ml of 2:1 chloroform:methanol.
Aqueous and organic layers were separated by centrifugation at 1000 × g for 5 min
and the organic layer was collected, dried under a stream of N2 and dissolved in
120 ml chloroform. A 10 μL aliquot was injected onto liquid chromatography/mass
spectrometry (LC/MS) and metabolites were separated by LC58. MS analysis was
performed with an electrospray ionization source on an Agilent 6430 QQQ
LC–MS/MS (Agilent Technologies) with the fragmentor voltage set to 100 V, the
capillary voltage was set to 3.0 kV, the drying gas temperature was 35 °C, the drying
gas flow rate was 10° l/min, and the nebulizer pressure was 35 psi. Metabolites were
identified by SRM of the transition from precursor to product ions at associated
optimized collision energies and retention times58. Metabolites were quantified by
integrating the area under the curve, then normalized to internal standard values
and values determined by comparison to a standard curve of each metabolite of
interest run simultaneous to the experimental samples.
Plasma leptin was measured using the mouse Leptin Elisa Kit (Chrystal Chem).
Circulating pituitary hormones, bone markers, and plasma catecholamines were
measured by the VUMC Hormone Assay and Analytic Services Core. Briefly, levels
of serum pituitary and thyroid hormones were measured by radioimmunoassay.
Bone markers were measured by the Millipore bone metabolism mulitplex
fluorescent Luminex Assay. For catecholamine analysis, plasma was collected in the
afternoon and immediately treated with EGTA–glutathione and subsequently
measured by high-performance liquid chromatography.
Histology. Tissue was collected and cleaned of excess tissue and fixed in 4%
paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin. For BAT, ovary and spleen 5 µm
sections were cut, processed, stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and bright
field images were taken using the Luminera Infinity-3. Femoral samples were
cleaned of soft tissue, fixed in 4% PFA and demineralized in 10% EDTA for
10–14 days before being embedded in paraffin wax. Sections measuring 5 µm were
then cut using the Leica RM2165 and subsequently stained with H&E or stained
with TRAP. Photoshop software was used to remove background in nontissue areas
for images taken of ovaries and distal femurs.
Stereotaxic delivery of AAV2. Adeno-associated virus sereotype 2 (AAV2) from
UNC Vector Core was injected bilaterally into isoflurane-anesthetized 9–16-week-
old adult Esr1fl/fl female mice. VMH coordinates: A–P: −1.56 mm from Bregma;
lateral: ±0.85 mm (millimeters) from Bregma; D–V: −5.8 mm from the skull;
ARC coordinates: A–P: −1.58 mm from Bregma; lateral ±0.25 mm from Bregma;
D–V: −5.8 mm from the skull. AAV2-virus was injected bilaterally into adult
Esr1fl/fl 19–24 week-old-female mice 5–8-week post-OVX. Buprenorphine
(0.1 mg/kg i.p.) was provided as analgesia after surgery and as needed. For animals
receiving AAV2-Cre, an n of at least 12 was used to ensure a large enough sample
size considering anticipated misses or miss-targeting of AAV2 virus. Misses were
characterized as no ablation of ERα in the VMH or ARC in AAV2-Cre groups.
Micro-computed tomography. Volumetric bone density and bone volume were
measured at the right femur, tibio-fibular joint, or midshaft, and L5 vertebrae using
a Scanco Medical µCT 50 specimen scanner calibrated to a hydroxyapatite phan-
tom. Briefly, samples were fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin and scanned
in 70% ethanol. Scanning was performed using a voxel size of 10 mm and an X-ray
tube potential of 55 kVp and X-ray intensity of 109 µA. Scanned regions included
2 mm region of the femur proximal to epiphyseal plate, 1 mm region of the femoral
mid-diaphysis and the whole L5 vertebrae.
Longitudinal live animal µCT imaging was performed using a Scanco Medical
vivaCT 40 preclinical scanner. Animals were anesthetized and a 2 mm region of the
distal femur was scanned. Similarly, a trabecular bone compartment of 1 mm
length proximal to the epiphyseal plate was measured. Cortical parameters were
assessed at the diaphysis in an adjacent 0.4 mm region of the femur.
In both specimen and in vivo scanning, volumes of interest were evaluated
using Scanco evaluation software. Representative 3D images created using Scanco
Medical mCT Ray v4.0 software. Segmented volume of trabecular bone presented
from anterior perspective and ventral side of vertebrae. Segmented volume of
cortical bone presented as transverse cross-sectional image. For image acquisition
of whole femur, bones were dissected, cleaned of any soft tissue, imaged with
iPhone 8 and then cropped and edited in Photoshop CC.
Biomechanical strength tests. Right femurs underwent three-point bend test
using the ElectroForce 3200 mechanical load frame. Lower supports were separated
by a span of 8 mm to support two ends of the specimen. The testing head was
aligned at the midpoint between the supports. Femurs were preloaded to a force of
1 N then loaded at a rate of 0.2 mm/s. Loading was terminated upon mechanical
failure, determined by a drop in force to 0.5 N. Force displacement data collected
every 0.01 s. Load-to-failure tests were performed to measure the uniaxial com-
pressive strength of the L5 vertebral bodies. Before testing, the posterior elements
and endplates were removed from the vertebrae, resulting in vertebral bodies with
plano-parallel ends. Tests included five preconditioning cycles to 0.3% strain fol-
lowed by a ramp to failure at a rate of 0.5% strain/sec. Vertebral strength was
defined as the maximum compressive force sustained during the tests. All tests
were performed at room temperature using an electro-mechanical load frame
(Electroforce 3200; Bose, Eden Prairie, MN).

 Dynamic histomorphometry. To determine bone formation and mineralization,
females (age 12–14 and 33 weeks) were injected with 20 mg/kg of calcein (Sigma-
Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) 7 days before euthanasia along with 15 mg/kg of
demeclocycline (Sigma-Aldrich) 2 days before euthanasia. Bones were fixed in 4%
formalin. Before histomorphometric analysis, mosaic-tiled images of distal femurs
were acquired at ×20 magnification with a Zeiss Axioplan Imager M1 microscope
(Carl Zeiss MicroImaging) fitted with a motorized stage. The tiled images were
stitched and converted to a single image using the Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss
MicroImaGing) prior to blinded analyses being performed using image-analysis
software (Bioquant Image Analysis Corp., Nashville, TN, USA). The dynamic
indices of bone formation within the same region that were measured on 10-mm
sections and percent mineralizing surface (MS/BS), MAR, and surface-based BFR/
BS were determined by Bioquant OSTEO software.
Microdissection and profiling of the ARC and bone marrow. Flushed bone
marrow was obtained as described above from control and mutant female femur at
4.5 weeks of age. Microdissected ARC tissue was obtained from control and mutant
female mice (11–20-week old) using the optic chiasm as a reference point, a 2 mm
block of tissue containing the hypothalamus was isolated with a matrix slicer.
Microdissection techniques were validated by enrichment for AgRP, Cited 1 (ARC),
and absence of Tac1, Cbln1 (VMH). For both bone marrow and ARC, total RNA
was purified using the PureLink RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen, Waltham MA).
Amplified cDNA was generated from 10 to 50 ng of total RNA using the Ovation
RNA-Seq System V2 or Trio (Nugen, San Carlos, CA). For the ARC, cDNA was
fragmented to 200 bp using a Covaris M220 sonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA). For
the ARC, barcoded sequencing libraries were prepared from 100 ng of fragmented
cDNA using the Ovation Ultralow System V2 (Nugen, San Carlos, CA) and single-
end 50 bp reads sequenced from the multiplexed libraries on the HiSeq 4000
(Illumina, San Diego, CA) at the UCSF Center for Advanced Technologies. For
ARC and bone marrow samples, sequencing generated reads were mapped to the
mouse genome (NCBI37/mm10) using TopHat2. Reads that mapped to exons in
annotated genes were counted using HTSeq59. Final quantification and statistical
testing of differentially expressed genes (adjusted p value < 0.05) was performed
using DESeq260.
