OBJECTIVES: To examine the prevalence of child and family characteristics associated with 
adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) in Hispanic children in immigrant families compared 
with Hispanic children in US-native families.
METHODS: Data were from the nationally representative 2011–2012 National Survey of 
Children’s Health. Parent-reported child ACE exposure was classified as no ACEs (0), low 
ACEs (1), or high ACEs (≥2). By using multinomial logistic regression, we evaluated the odds 
of low or high ACE exposure versus no ACE exposure by immigrant family status and child 
and family characteristics (eg, insurance status, child health status, or household-to-income 
ratio).
RESULTS: The study sample included 12 162 Hispanic children. More children in immigrant 
families lived ≤200% of the federal poverty level compared with children in US-native 
families (80% vs 47%, respectively; P < .001). Thirty percent of children in US-native 
families reported high ACEs compared with only 16% of children in immigrant families  
(P < .001). The odds of high ACE exposure versus no ACE exposure for children in immigrant 
families compared with US-native children was 0.46 (95% confidence interval: 0.34–0.61). 
Child and family characteristics did not explain the difference in odds of ACE exposure by 
immigrant family status.
CONCLUSIONS: Children in immigrant families had significantly lower odds of ACE exposure 
despite higher prevalence of poverty. This may not reflect a true health advantage in this 
population. There may be unmeasured factors that buffer children in immigrant families 
from ACE exposure, or ACE questions may not capture the adverse experiences specific to 
immigrant families.

What’s KnOWn On thIs subject: Poor child 
and adult health outcomes are linked to poverty 
and adverse childhood experiences (ACEs). The 
relationship between ACEs and Hispanic immigrant 
family status is unknown.
What thIs stuDy aDDs: Hispanic children in 
immigrant families had lower odds of ACEs, but child 
or family characteristics did not explain this finding. 
Study findings reveal that ACE domains may need 
expansion to adequately account for the immigrant 
experience.

 Hispanic children currently make up 
a quarter of all children in the United 
States and are projected to remain 
the largest ethnic minority group 
among children.1 Although 90% 
of Hispanic children are US-born, 
Hispanic children in immigrant 
families (foreign-born children 
with at least 1 foreign-born parent, 
or US-born children with at least 
1 foreign-born parent) comprise 
over half of all immigrant children 
in the United States.2 Children in 
immigrant families are more likely to 
be uninsured, to live in poverty, and 
to experience food insecurity than 
white children.3 
–5
Adverse childhood experiences 
(ACEs), broadly defined as abuse, 
violence exposure, and family 
dysfunction, have lifelong negative 
effects on health and contribute 
to health disparities.6 
– 
9 ACEs 
disproportionately affect low-income 
children who are already at risk for 
poor long-term health secondary 
to poverty.9, 
 
10 However, parent-
reported ACE exposure among 
Hispanic children is lower than 
among African American children, 
despite similarly high rates of 
childhood poverty.11, 
 
12
Contrasts in expected health 
outcomes in Hispanics have 
been previously described as an 
epidemiologic paradox referred 
to as the “healthy immigrant 
phenomenon.” 
13 Despite higher 
poverty, lower education, and 
decreased health care access, 
Hispanic immigrants have similar 
or better outcomes in certain 
health parameters than whites and 
US-born Hispanics.13 
– 
15 Evidence in 
support of the healthy immigrant 
phenomenon is mixed, and many 
Hispanic immigrant families 
experience risk factors for poor 
health outcomes.13, 
 
16 One reason 
Hispanics in previous empirical work 
may appear particularly healthy 
is related to selection, specifically 
underrepresentation or exclusion 
of at-risk Hispanic populations in 
research: the undocumented, those 
with unstable housing, and the 
uninsured, many of whom are from 
immigrant families.
The evidence in favor of the 
healthy immigrant phenomenon 
could, in part, reflect differences in 
exposure to ACEs among immigrant 
families. Data on the prevalence 
of ACEs in Hispanic children, and 
particularly children in immigrant 
families, remain sparse. Although 
many researchers have explored 
racial and ethnic disparities in 
the prevalence of individual ACEs 
(food insecurity, domestic violence 
exposure, or substance abuse 
exposure), no researchers that we 
know of have explored ACE exposure 
by immigrant family status.17 
–21 
Thus, our aims in this study were 
to examine the association between 
ACE exposure and immigrant family 
status for Hispanic children and 
whether factors such as children’s 
demographic characteristics, family 
structure, or family health outcomes 
were related to ACE exposure.
MethODs
Data source
Data for this study were from the 
2011 to 2012 National Survey of 
Children’s Health (NSCH), from 
the Child and Adolescent Health 
Measurement Initiative. The NSCH 
is a nationally representative 
landline and mobile phone survey of 
households with at least 1 resident 
child 0 to 17 years old, sponsored 
by the Maternal and Child Health 
Bureau. The 2011 to 2012 NSCH 
included 95 677 children. Sixty eight 
percent of survey respondents were 
mothers, 24% were fathers, and 
7% were guardians. A weighting 
strategy was employed such that 
survey participants are reflective 
of the demographic composition 
of noninstitutionalized children 0 
to 17 years old in each state and 
the District of Columbia, with an 
overall response rate of 38.2%. 
Detailed NSCH survey methodology 
is available elsewhere.22 This study 
was exempt from institutional review 
board review because the data set is 
deidentified and publicly available.
sample
The analytic sample was restricted 
to Hispanic children of any race with 
nativity information available for 
at least 1 parent (n = 12 162). This 
reflected 12% of the unweighted 
NSCH sample.
Measures
ACE Exposure
The primary outcome variable of 
interest was ACE exposure category. 
The NSCH includes 9 ACE questions 
modified from those used in studies 
of adults and validated for use by 
parents and guardians.23 The number 
of ACEs parents could report ranged 
from 0 to 9 (Supplemental Table 
3). Following other analyses in 
which this data set was used, 
18 we 
categorized ACE exposure as: no ACE 
exposure (0 ACEs), low ACE exposure 
(1 ACE), and high ACE exposure (≥2 
ACEs).
Immigrant Family Status
The primary independent variable 
was immigrant family status. 
Foreign-born children composed only 
6.8% of the total sample and were 
combined with US-born children 
with at least 1 immigrant parent. 
Consistent with previous literature, 
we defined a child in an immigrant 
family as a foreign-born or US-born 
child with at least 1 foreign-born 
parent.13, 
 
24 A child in a US-native 
family was defined as a US-born child 
with US-born parents.24
Family and Child Characteristics
Family and child characteristics 
included as covariates were: mean 
age of index child, household 
income-to-poverty ratio (≤200%, 
201%–400%, or ≥401% of federal 
poverty level [FPL]), highest parental 
educational attainment (less than

 high school, high school, or more

(female-headed household, 2 adult 
home, or other), maternal mental 
health (excellent, very good, good, 
or fair, poor) as per self-report or 
report by proxy if another adult other 
than the mother was completing 
the survey (∼22% of the sample), 
insurance type (public, private, 
or uninsured), parent-rated or 
guardian-rated child health status 
(excellent, very good, good, fair, or 
poor), and primary language at home 
(English or other).
We also included a measure of family 
environment supportiveness on the 
basis of the parents’ responses to 
2 questions: “In general, how well 
do you feel you are coping with the 
day-to-day demands of [parenthood 
and/or raising children]?” and 
“Is there someone that you can 
turn to for day-to-day emotional 
help with [parenthood and/or 
raising children]?” 
25 Parents who 
reported “very well” or “somewhat 
well” to both questions were 
classified as having a supportive 
family environment (yes = 1). 
Finally, we classified public benefit 
participation if the respondent 
reported that at least 1 household 
member participated in at least one 
of the following programs: Women, 
Infants, and Children; Temporary 
Assistance for Needy Families; or the 
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance 
Program.
analysis
In bivariate analyses, we used 
Pearson’s χ2 and t tests to examine 
differences in child and family 
characteristics by immigrant 
family status. To assess differences 
in odds of reporting high or low 
ACE exposure (compared with 
no ACE exposure) by immigrant 
family status, we used unadjusted 
multinomial logistic regression 
models. Then we adjusted for family 
and child characteristics to evaluate 
the role of these factors in explaining 
any differences between the groups. 
Covariates in the multivariate model 
included household income-to-
poverty ratio, highest household 
education, family structure, maternal 
mental health, family environment 
supportiveness, public benefit 
participation, child health status, and 
insurance type.

 Initiative, to account for the 9% 
missing data in the household 
income-to-poverty ratio; therefore, 
we retained this variable in our 
analyses.22 Although the level of 
missingness for maternal mental 
health was 6%, we chose to retain 
this variable because of correlation 
of poor maternal mental health with 
risk for ACE exposure.26 Listwise 
deletion was employed. All analyses 
were conducted with Stata version 
13 (StataCorp, College Station, TX), 
accounting for survey sampling 
weights.
ResuLts
Hispanic children in immigrant 
families comprised 66% of the 
study sample. Family and child 
characteristics by immigrant family 
status are displayed in Table 1. 
In general, children in immigrant 
families were more likely than 
children in US-native families to live 
in a low-income household (≤200% 
of the FPL), have public insurance or 
no insurance, participate in public 
benefits, live in a nonsingle woman 
family structure, and live in a home 
in which their highest parental 
educational attainment was less than 
high school.
The prevalence of high ACE exposure 
(≥2 ACEs) was significantly 
higher in children in US-native 
families compared with children in 
immigrant families (30% vs 16%; 
P < .001). Children in immigrant 
families had higher prevalence of 
no ACE exposure compared with 
children in US-native families 
(53% vs 44%; P < .001) (Fig 1). 
For both groups, parental divorce 
and economic hardship were the 
most prevalent ACE exposures (Fig 
2). A summary of individual ACE 
questions by immigrant family status 
and a summary of family and child 
characteristics by ACE category are 
available in Supplemental Tables 3 
and 4, respectively.
The results of unadjusted and 
adjusted multinomial regression 
models are shown in Table 2. In 
the unadjusted models, children in 
immigrant families had significantly 
lower odds of high ACE exposure 
(versus no ACE exposure) than 
children in US-native families. The 
odds of any ACE exposure by child 
and family characteristics were 
generally similar in magnitude 
and direction in both Hispanic 
family groups. In adjusted models, 
children in immigrant families still 
had significantly lower odds of ACE 
exposure compared with children 
in US-native families (adjusted odds 
ratio [aOR]: 0.5 [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 0.34–0.61]) (Table 2). 
The relationship between family and 
child characteristics and the odds 
of ACE exposure were similar by 
Hispanic immigrant family status. 
Poor maternal mental health and 
single woman family structure had 
the strongest associations with ACE 
exposure in both groups. Similarly, in 
both groups, low-income or middle-
income households (≤200% of FPL 
or 201%–400%) were associated 
with twice the odds of high ACE 
exposure compared with the high-
income reference group.
Notably, a high school or less than high 
school education was significantly 
associated with decreased odds of 
high ACE exposure in children in 
immigrant families only (high school 
aOR: 0.6 [95% CI: 0.37–0.81], less 
than high school aOR: 0.6 [95% CI: 
0.42–0.92]). Lack of a supportive 
family environment was significantly 
associated with increased odds of high 
ACE exposure in children in immigrant 
families only (aOR: 1.7 [95% CI: 0.1.17–
2.43]). Participation in public insurance

 (versus private) was significantly 
associated with a higher odds of any 
ACE exposure in children in US-native 
families only, but participation in other 
public benefits was not associated 
with ACE exposure in either group. In 
the US-native group, after adjusting 
for child and family characteristics, 
the odds of high ACE exposure for 
children of mothers with fair or poor 
maternal mental health decreased by 
half from 6.2 (95% CI: 2.94–13.04) to 
3.2 (95% CI: 1.27–7.88). Similarly, the 
odds of high ACE exposure decreased 
by half for income ≤200% of FPL in 
the US-native adjusted model from 4.4 
(95% CI: 2.81–6.83) to 2.3 (95% CI: 
1.31–3.91).
DIscussIOn
We found that the odds of high 
ACE exposure were greater among 
children in US-native Hispanic families 
compared with children in immigrant 
families. This disparity was not 
explained by differences in child and 
family characteristics between the 2 
Hispanic family groups. There are at 
least 2 possible explanations for this 
finding. First, there may be additional 
unmeasured confounders that buffer 
Hispanic children from ACE exposure 
in immigrant families, and/or negative 
effects of unmeasured factors for 
Hispanic children in US-native families. 
Second, ACE questions may not be 
capturing the adverse experiences 
specific to immigrant families.
The literature on resilience in 
immigrant families shows that strong 
family and community networks 
can buffer the effects of ACE 
exposure.27 
– 
30 In addition, religious 
and spiritual values among Hispanic 
immigrant parents and positive 
cultural identity among Hispanic 
youth correlate with positive self-
rated health and ability to cope with 
mental health issues, discrimination, 
and stressful life events.31 
– 
33 
When parents are resilient to their 
circumstances, they may be better 
able to buffer the effects of negative 
exposures on their children. When 
youth are grounded in their cultural 
identities, they may be better able 
to thrive in the face of stressors. 
The authors of emerging studies are 
responding to the need to account for 
some of these important factors by 
proposing an expansion of adversity 
scale domains to include questions 
about family strengths, cultural 
values, child self-regulation, and 
parental skills.34, 
 
35
On the other hand, it is possible 
that adverse experiences and 
environments that are specific to 
the immigrant experience are not 
reflected in traditional measures of 
ACE exposure, including measures 
used in the NSCH. For example, the 
potential emotional consequences of 
an absent parent are likely universal 
among children. In immigrant families, 
death, divorce, and incarceration 
are not the only reasons for parental 
absence, but they are the only types 
of parental absence included in 
traditional ACE questions. Children

 may experience prolonged separation 
from parents related to parental 
deportation, complicated and often 
discriminatory immigration policies, 
and financial limitations.36 
– 
38 The 
indefinite nature of these separations 
has powerful consequences on 
childhood attachment, and emotional, 
social, and physical health.36, 
37 
Including a question on deportation 
and migration-associated parental 
separation would likely increase the 
prevalence of ACE exposure in the 
immigrant family group and reduce 
the differences seen across Hispanic 
family groups.
Restructuring existing ACE questions 
may be another approach to 
capturing experiences relevant to 
Hispanic families. One example from 
this data set is a question about 
experiencing unfair treatment or 
judgment (“Was the child ever 
treated or judged unfairly because of 
[his or her] race or ethnic group?”). 
The prevalence of positive response 
to this question was similarly low 
in both groups (4% for children 
in immigrant families and 6% for 
children in US-native families, P < 
.042). One reason may be that the 
parent may not be fully aware of their 
child’s experiences outside the home. 
One cross-sectional study of >5000 
preadolescent fifth-graders across 
3 urban cities found that African 
American and Hispanic children were 
more likely to report perceived racial 
and/or ethnic discrimination than 
white children, and 80% of these 
experiences occurred at school.39
Another possibility is that the 
discrimination question aimed 
at the child may not capture 
systematic exclusion from resources. 
Immigrant prejudice, racism, and 
discrimination may be a part of an 
immigrant family’s experience, often 
manifesting as exclusion from health, 
housing, and economic resources.37 
Discrimination among Hispanic 
adults and adolescents is associated 
with depression, family dysfunction, 
and alcohol and substance use; in 
younger children, discrimination is 
associated with depression, attention-
deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and 
conduct disorder.39 
– 
43 Perhaps we 
would see a greater prevalence of 
this ACE and be able to more directly 
address the associated negative health 
consequences if survey participants 
were provided with examples of 
unfair judgment and treatment 
and if the question extended to the 
primary caregiver’s experiences. 
There are also limited, if any, data on 
immigrant families’ interpretation 
of ACEs questions. Culturally and 
linguistically appropriate translations 
of questions across the heterogeneous 
Hispanic immigrant population may 
be difficult to achieve.44, 
 
45 There is 
also concern for social desirability bias 
given families’ vulnerable position 
as immigrants.46– 
48 Ultimately, the 
absence of ACE questions related to 
the immigrant experience may limit 
identification of trauma experienced by 
immigrant children, whereas variation 
in cultural and linguistic interpretation 
of ACE questions may compromise 
comparison of responses across 
language and cultural differences.
Adverse experiences and poverty 
are closely linked.6 In our analysis, 
children in immigrant families had 
significantly higher prevalence of 
poverty but experienced fewer 
ACEs. If an ACEs screener is used 
in a clinical setting to identify and 
connect families with resources, 
it may fail to identify a significant 
portion of in-need, low-income 
Hispanic families because they 
have a low ACEs score. Although 
screening tools can be useful 
in a busy clinical practice, it is 
important to maintain the ability to 
efficiently and effectively identify 
specific social needs that mediate 
effects of adversity, such as food 
and housing insecurity and other 
social determinants of health for 
which evidence-based screening 
and supports exist.49 On the basis of 
our findings, in practices that serve

Hispanic immigrant families, we 
would not recommend using ACE 
score to decide whether to connect 
families to support services. There is 
ongoing research on how providing 
support to families on the basis of 
screening for social determinants 
such as food, housing, or economic 
insecurity may be a better way to 
address these social needs.50, 
 
51
These findings must be interpreted 
within the context of potential 
limitations. As with most 
observational data, we cannot draw 
causal inferences as to how social, 
family, and child characteristics 
influence the presence or absence of 
ACE exposure, nor can we capture 
a child’s coping response to an 
ACE exposure. Because foreign-
born children were combined with 
US-born children with at least 1 
immigrant parent, there may be 
limitations in generalizing our 
findings to all foreign-born Hispanic 
children. In addition, the NSCH does 
not collect data related to citizenship 
or documentation status. The 
absence of immigration status data 
limit analysis of ACE exposure and 
immigrant legal status. The sample 
was not stratified by country of 
origin, and factors like mental health 
disorders, for example, may vary by 
country of origin and length of time 
in the United States.52
Another limitation of this data set is 
there may be variability in cultural 
perception of adversity, which may 
influence ACE reporting, particularly 
among immigrant family groups. 
For example, there is some evidence 
that African Americans underreport 
racism and discrimination as a 
significant stressor, because these 
experiences may be perceived as 
commonplace in some segregated 
communities.53 In addition, the 
national-level data provided by 
NSCH do not allow us to account 
for variability in state-funded and 
county-funded health and social 
benefit programs for immigrants, 
which may affect the prevalence and 
risk of ACE exposure.
We also found some relationships 
between ACE exposure and family 
and child characteristics that were 
unexpected and were not consistent 
with general findings on this 
topic. Specifically, higher parental 
education correlated with greater 
odds of ACE exposure for Hispanic 
children in immigrant families. 
Particular to immigrant adults, higher 
education may not result in better 
financial opportunities because of 
legal exclusion from higher-paying 
employment. Similarly, participation 
in public (versus private) insurance 
only significantly correlated with ACE 
exposure in US-native families. This 
may be due to the smaller sample 
of Hispanic children in immigrant 
families with private insurance. We 
postulate that in US-native families, for 
whom eligibility for private insurance 
is potentially greater, participation 
in public insurance correlates more 
closely with poverty and associated 
stressors than for children in 
immigrant families. Further analyses 
would be needed to draw conclusions 
from these relationships.

Capturing the experiences of 
children in immigrant families 
is crucial to understanding and 
supporting their health and well-
being. It is well established that 
ACEs in childhood have formative 
impacts on the developing brain and 
the neuroendocrine and immune 
systems.54 Biological adaptations 
to adverse conditions can limit 
children’s opportunities and 
contribute to health and educational 
disparities. The experiences of 
Hispanic children in immigrant 
families are broad, change with time, 
and may differ between generations 
of children. The experiences of 
many include a combination of 
poverty, discrimination, and violence 
exposure intertwined with strong 
cultural and family values, resilience, 
and determination to succeed. 
Current ACE measures may not fully 
capture buffers and adversities that 
are specific to children’s experiences 
growing up in immigrant families.
The possibility of family separation 
at border detention facilities 
and increased detainment and 
deportation under Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
is increasingly part of American 
political discourse. We know that 
parents have the power to help 
children heal from traumatic 
experiences, and policies aimed 
at separating families may have 
deleterious effects on a child’s ability 
to thrive in the face of trauma.55, 
 
56  
Now more than ever, it is crucial 
for clinicians and researchers to 
understand trauma and adversity 
in children in immigrant families to 
guide and support child health.
