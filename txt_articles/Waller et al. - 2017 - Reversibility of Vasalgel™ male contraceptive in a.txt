Abstract
Background: Development of a non-hormonal long-acting reversible contraceptive for men could have a
significant impact on reducing unintended pregnancies. Vasalgel™ is a high molecular weight polymer consisting of
styrene-alt-maleic acid (SMA) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide being developed as a reversible male contraceptive
device. It forms a hydrogel when implanted into the vasa deferentia, which prevents the passage of sperm.
Previous studies in the rabbit have proven its efficacy, durability and rapid onset. This study evaluates the capacity
to restore sperm concentrations in ejaculates after a reversal procedure.
Methods: Sodium bicarbonate was injected into the vasa deferentia after fourteen months of azoospermia
following the injection of two device variations (Vasalgel 100 and Vasalgel 80). Semen samples were then collected
for six months and sperm characteristics were compared to baseline levels. Samples of vasa deferentia were
obtained for histological examination.
Results: Spermatozoa were present in all subject ejaculates after the reversal procedure. Sperm concentration and
sperm motility were similar to baseline levels after reversal, while sperm forward progression was significantly lower
and normal acrosomes were not observed. Forward progression percentages increased linearly during six months
of semen collection, however, normal acrosomes were not observed at the conclusion of the study. Histologically,
several vasa deferentia were clear of the device and contained an intact epithelial lining. A smaller proportion of
tissues contained residual test material. A secondary intraluminal inflammatory response was seen occasionally in
the tissues containing residual material. There was no difference between the two device variations for studied
parameters.
Conclusions: Vasalgel’s prevention of sperm transport for 14 months was reversed through an intravasal injection
of sodium bicarbonate. Post-reversal sperm concentrations and motility returned to baseline levels during the six-
month follow up. Residual material in the vas lumen or compromised epididymal and vas deferens function may
be resulting in reduced forward progression and loss of acrosomes during transit through the vas. Reduced forward
progression and the lack of normal acrosomes strongly suggest impaired sperm function.

 Contexte: Le développement d’une contraception réversible, de longue durée et non hormonale pour les hommes
pourrait avoir un impact significatif sur la réduction du nombre de grossesses non désirées. Le Vasalgel ™ est un
polymère de haut poids moléculaire constitué d’acide styrène-alt-maléique (SMA) dissous dans du
diméthylsulfoxyde, en cours de développement comme moyen réversible de contraception masculine. Une fois
injecté dans les canaux déférents, il forme un hydrogel qui fait obstacle au passage des spermatozoïdes. De
précédentes études chez le lapin ont prouvé son efficacité ainsi que la rapidité et la persistance de son effet. La
présente étude a évalué la capacité de restauration de la concentration de spermatozoïdes dans les éjaculats
obtenus après une procédure de réversion.
Matériel et Méthodes: Du bicarbonate de sodium a été injecté dans chaque canal déférent après quatorze mois
d’azoospermie secondaire à l’injection de deux formulations du produit testé (Vasalgel 100 et Vasalgel 80). Des
échantillons de sperme ont ensuite été recueillis pendant six mois et les caractéristiques des spermatozoïdes
comparées aux valeurs de départ. Des échantillons de canal déférent ont été prélevés pour analyse histologique.
Résultats: Des spermatozoïdes furent retrouvés dans les éjaculats de tous les animaux après la procédure de
réversion. La concentration de spermatozoïdes et le pourcentage de spermatozoïdes mobiles après réversion
étaient similaires aux valeurs de départ, mais le pourcentage de spermatozoïdes à mobilité progressive
directionnelle était significativement moindre que celui des valeurs de départ, et aucun acrosone normal n’a été
observé. Les pourcentages de spermatozoïdes à mobilité progressive directionnelle ont augmenté linéairement
durant les six mois de recueil du sperme ; cependant, aucun acrosome normal n’a été retrouvé à la fin de l’étude.
Au plan histologique, de nombreux canaux déférents ne contenaient plus aucune trace du produit testé et étaient
bordés par un épithélium intact. Une plus faible proportion d’échantillons contenait des traces du produit testé. On
a occasionnellement observé une réaction inflammatoire secondaire dans la lumière des canaux contenant des
résidus de produit testé. Il n’a été retrouvé aucune différence entre les deux formulations du produit testé pour les
paramètres étudiés.
Conclusions: L’obstacle au transport des spermatozoïdes pendant 14 mois réalisé par le Vasalgel™ a été supprimé
par une injection intra canalaire de sodium de bicarbonate. Après la réversion, la concentration de spermatozoïdes
et le pourcentage de spermatozoïdes mobiles reviennent à leur valeur de départ durant les six mois de suivi. La
présence dans la lumière du canal de résidus du produit testé, ou une altération des fonctions épididymaire et
déférentielle, pourraient entraîner la réduction de la mobilité progressive directionnelle et la perte des acrosome
durant le transit des spermatozoïdes dans les canaux. La réduction de la mobilité progressive et l’absence
d’acrosomes normaux suggèrent fortement une altération de la fonction spermatique.

Background
Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) methods are
recommended for pregnancy prevention because of their
potential for high effectiveness and low burden to users.
LARC options available to women (IUDs and implants)
have been associated with high levels of continuation [1].
While LARCs often cost more initially, they are among
the most cost effective birth control methods given their
high efficacy rate and duration of use, especially when
considering the costs of unintended pregnancy [2, 3].
Having a variety of new fertility control options for men
and women would accommodate people of different ages
and life stages [4]. The availability, variety and effectiveness
of LARCs for women have had a significant impact on re-
ducing the unintended pregnancy rate [5]. It is likely that
similar options for men would also have positive impacts
on reproductive health. However, currently there are no
LARCs for men. Vasectomy, while long-acting, is generally
considered permanent due to difficulties of reversal, the
expense, and lower success rate in restoring fertility [6].
Other options (condoms, withdrawal) are short-term solu-
tions with high pregnancy rates for typical use [7].
Research on male contraception has revolved around
both hormonal and nonhormonal methods that suppress
sperm production, disrupt sperm maturation or func-
tion, or alter sperm transport or motility [8]. A promis-
ing advancement is Vasalgel, a high molecular weight
polymer of styrene-alt-maleic acid (SMA acid) being
developed as a LARC for men. The device is injected
into the vas deferens to block sperm from transiting
through the vas deferens. The implant remains in a soft
gel-like state, with the ability to adapt to the interior
lumen of the vas deferens and minimize any accommo-
dation of the vas to the presence of the material. It
forms a hydrogel which allows transit of water soluble
molecules but not larger structures such as spermatozoa.

 Initial research on rabbits has confirmed that Vasalgel
provides a rapid onset of azoospermia with durability
over a 12 month test period [9]. The study also con-
firmed the efficacy of the SMA acid in Vasalgel as com-
pared to styrene-maleic anhydride (SMA anhydride),
which is the basis of a similar product called RISUG that
has been studied in India for over three decades [10].
Vasalgel’s composition gives it important advantages for
large-scale manufacturing and product stability which
should facilitate regulatory approval.
The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effi-
cacy of a sodium bicarbonate injection into the vasa defer-
entia to reverse Vasalgel-induced azoospermia in rabbits.
Methods
Devices
Vasalgel devices consisted of 25% solutions by weight of
SMA in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The average mo-
lecular weight (Mw) of the SMA anhydride was 330 kDa
based on standardized gel permeation chromatography
(GPC) methodology (Jordi Labs, Mansfield, MA, USA).
The SMA acid was made by hydrolysis of the anhydride
and had a Mw of 360 kDa. One device contained only
SMA acid and is referred to as Vasalgel 100. A second
device contained a mixture of 80% SMA acid and 20%
SMA anhydride by weight and is referred to as Vasalgel
80. The final devices were prepared and packaged in a
nitrogen atmosphere in 4 ml glass vials by Polysciences,
Inc. (Warrington, PA, USA).
Subjects, housing and care
The study was performed using 7 mature azoospermic
male New Zealand White rabbits (Harlan Laboratories,
Oxford, MI) from the Vasalgel contraceptive efficacy
study. The animals averaged 1.9 years of age (SD = 0.07
weeks) and weighed an average of 4.6 kg (SD = 0.49 kg)
(see [9] for details of care and housing). Three mature
females were used as teasers for the collection of semen.
All animal procedures were approved by the Loyola
University Medical Center, (Maywood, IL) Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee.
Experimental design
Baseline semen sample collections were obtained prior
to implantation of the Vasalgel device during the contra-
ceptive efficacy study [9]. All rabbits received bilateral
vas deferens implants of Vasalgel 100 (n = 2) or Vasalgel
80 (n = 5). Fourteen months (SD = 0.75 months) after
implant the azoospermic males underwent a reversal
procedure to remove the Vasalgel and return patency to
the vasa deferentia. Semen collections began two weeks
following the procedure and continued for six months to
establish the presence and quality of spermatozoa.
Implantation of devices
Rabbits were injected with the devices as previously de-
scribed [9]. Briefly, the vasa deferentia of anesthetized
rabbits were externalized and injected with approximately
100–120 μl of the device in about 30–40 s using a 24
gauge 1.6 cm catheter (Quik-Cath by Baxter, Deerfield,
IL). The catheter was then removed, the vasa deferentia
gently compressed for about 30 s and the vasal muscularis
at the site of injection identified with a 6–0 Prolene
suture. The vas deferens was returned to the spermatic
cord and the site closed with 4–0 nylon sutures.
Reversal procedure
Animals
were
weighed,
administered
an
antibiotic
(Baytril® [Bayer Healthcare, KS, USA] 5 mg/kg) and then
anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of xylazine
HCl (4 mg/kg) and ketamine HCl (50 mg/kg) and a sub-
cutaneous injection of acepromazine maleate (1.0 mg/
kg). A 1 cm suprapubic transverse incision was made in
the midline approximately 2 cm cephalad to the pubic
symphysis.
The
spermatic
cords
were
brought
up
through the incision and isolated. The cremasteric fascia
was incised in a longitudinal fashion and the vas defer-
ens isolated with its blood supply. The suture marking
the site of implantation was identified.
A 19 gauge needle was used to enter the vasa deferen-
tia approximately 0.3 cm from the Vasalgel injection site
(towards the epididymis). A two lumen 24 gauge 15 cm
in length catheter was then inserted approximately 0.5
cm into the vas deferens and advanced to a maximum
distance of approximately 8 cm when resistance to fur-
ther insertion occurred. The catheter was then with-
drawn about 1 cm and a 20 ml syringe attached to the
outer lumen of the catheter to flush the vasa with
sodium bicarbonate solution (2 M, pH 8.0, Hospira,
Lake Forest, IL, USA). The central lumen provided a
path for any off gassing due to the reaction of Vasalgel
and the bicarbonate as well as any excess fluid being
instilled. Gentle pressure was initially applied to the
syringe until resistance was encountered, the pressure
stopped for about 15–30 s and then pressure again
applied. This process was repeated several times until
the gentle pressure on the syringe allowed unrestricted
flow of the bicarbonate through the vas. The number of
repeated cycles varied between vasa and the total volume
required prior to initially obtaining unrestricted flow
was about 2 to 5 ml of the bicarbonate solution. A
maximum of 10 ml was injected.
Semen collection and evaluation
Semen collections were performed using a warmed artifi-
cial vagina semen-collection device designed for use with
the rabbit and a “teaser” female to encourage mounting
[11]. Semen specimens were evaluated for volume, total

 sperm count, motility and forward progression using
manual methods.
Euthanasia and necropsy
Rabbits were euthanized using standard procedures at
the conclusion of the study and necropsied with particu-
lar attention to the reproductive tract.
Histological examination
The vasa deferentia from treated animals were harvested
and immersed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for fix-
ation. The tissues were processed, sectioned and stained
with hematoxylin and eosin utilizing standard methods
for evaluation.
Data analysis
Data were summarized by subject, device group (Vasalgel
100 and Vasalgel 80) and condition (baseline and post-
reversal) for each sperm measurement. The reversibility of
the device was evaluated by comparing the mean sperm
parameters (sperm concentration, forward progression
and motility) for each subject by condition and by device.
Initial evaluation of the data set revealed deviations from
normal distribution. Thus, nonparametric tests were ap-
plied to determine any difference between the Vasalgel
100 and Vasalgel 80 groups (Mann Whitney U test) and
evaluate any difference between the measures at baseline
vs. post-reversal (Wilcoxon Matched Pairs test) using
Statistica (StatSoft, Inc., Tulsa, OK, USA). A significance
level of p < 0.05 was determined. Data are presented as
mean ± standard deviation.
Results
A total of twelve vasa deferentia were successfully
flushed with 2–10 ml of sodium bicarbonate solution
(average 6.8 ± 4.70 ml). One vas in each of two rab-
bits in the Vasalgel 80 group, was not readily access-
ible or identifiable and could not be flushed. The
flushing medium resulted in off-gassing of CO2 and
the observation of some foam as it exited at the insertion
site, flowing around the outside of the catheter. Minor dis-
tention of the vas deferens was observed during flushing
in two subjects.
The average number of baseline semen samples col-
lected prior to implantation was 2.4 ± 0.5. Baseline
sperm concentration average prior to the administration
of the test devices was 221 ± 46 × 106 sperm/ml with
69.4 ± 10.2% motility and 40.9 ± 6.0% forward progres-
sion. Animals were azoospermic prior to the reversal
procedure. Semen collection commenced 14 days after
the reversal procedure and first semen samples obtained
on average at 18.9 ± 5.5 days post-reversal and contin-
ued for an average of 22.6 ± 3.3 weeks. Eighty percent of
attempted semen collections were successful and the
number of analyzable collections was 15.9 ± 6.3 per
subject during the post-reversal period.
Spermatozoa were observed in the ejaculates of all
subjects at an average of 23.7 ± 9.3 days after the rever-
sal procedure. Measurable sperm concentration was
evident at the first sperm collection in four subjects (two
Vasalgel 100 and two Vasalgel 80), with one as early as
12 days post-reversal. Sperm concentration was measur-
able in the other three rabbits after several additional
collections. Sperm concentrations were initially higher in
the first collections after the reversal procedure in
several animals and also higher compared to the baseline
(average 301.9 ± 57.2 × 106 sperm/ml). Motility averaged
62.3 ± 9.6% after reversal. Forward progression averaged
5.3 ± 0.9% after reversal, increasing from less than 3%
for all subjects immediately after reversal to more than
11% for all subjects at the last sample.
As illustrated in Fig. 1, some of the subjects in the
Vasalgel 80 group had low initial sperm concentrations,
but this observation is difficult to interpret due to high
variation across individuals and over time as well as the
small number of subjects. Two of the Vasalgel 80 sub-
jects only had one vas deferens flushed. Of these, one
had sperm present in the first semen sample and the

 other had sperm by the fifth sample. Statistically, the
three sperm parameters (concentration, motility and
forward progression) did not differ for the Vasalgel 100
vs. Vasalgel 80 (all p > 0.05). Therefore, all groups were
combined for further statistical tests.
Statistical comparisons between the baseline sperm
measurements and those obtained after the reversal
procedure were conducted to determine whether the
values had returned to normal. Sperm concentration
was not significantly different between baseline and post-
reversal (Wilcoxon Z = 1.01, p < 0.31) (see Fig. 2). Sperm
motility was also not significantly different when compar-
ing baseline to post-reversal (Wilcoxon Z = 1.25, p < 0.17)
(Fig. 3). Forward progression was significantly lower after
the reversal procedure (Wilcoxon Z = 2.37, p < 0.018)
(Fig. 3) with a positive trendline (R2 = 0.90 (see Fig. 4)).
The normal large rabbit acrosome was not observed
on spermatozoa during post reversal semen analysis.
This condition was observed throughout the period of
time in which sperm were obtained and analyzed post
reversal.
Gross observations of the reproductive tract during
necropsy indicated that the testes were normal in size
and color. The prostate and epididymides appeared
normal except one subject had a darkened epididymis
on the right side and two subjects had a smaller than
normal epididymis. Other gross observations of the vasa
deferentia included adhesions, swelling or distention at
the end near the epididymis (5/12) and thinning at the
prostate end (8/12).
Twenty segments of vas deferens from five of the
rabbits were examined (two segments from the treated
left and right vas deferens from each animal). The vasa
deferentia in the animals exhibited a variety of intralum-
inal changes (See Fig. 5a–f). Hydrogel residue was
observed in 4 of 20 segments (See Fig. 5a, b and c). Two
of these segments were from one animal with residue
observed in segments from both vasa deferentia. The
material appeared as a non-fibrillar homogenous ampho-
philic material. Frequently, clear fracturing was observed
in this material and was interpreted as a processing
artifact. In these animals, the mucosal epithelium was
variably replaced by round to polygonal cells with
abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and round to oval nu-
clei. These cells often exhibited close association to each
other and were interpreted as epithelioid macrophages.
Similar material present in the lumen of the vas deferens
of these animals was also observed in the surrounding
interstitial connective tissue and interpreted as extra-
luminal hydrogel. The accumulation of this material was
often arranged in a multifocal to coalescing nodular
pattern and was associated with a surrounding rim of
epithelioid macrophages and multinucleated giant cells
(See Fig. 5f). This was a similar change to that seen in
the non-reversed animals in the previous study [9].
In seven of the 20 segments, intraluminal fragmented
material was observed with similar staining properties as
the material seen in the intact device plugs. Some of
these fragmented hydrogel regions contained scattered
spermatozoa (See Fig. 5e). Nine of 20 segments exhibited
moderate epithelial attenuation and flattening character-
ized by a cuboidal to squamous appearance. Segmental
mucosal epithelial loss without inflammation was ob-
served in some regions in this group. This epithelial
change was not always associated with the presence of
an intact plug or fragments of intraluminal device (i.e.
was seen in segments of clear vas deferens). The
remaining segments (7 of 20) exhibited intact epithelium
that appeared columnar and frequently had a ciliated
apical surface (See Fig. 5d).

 Discussion
The historical lack of focus on male contraceptive devel-
opment entails cultural, financial and technical aspects
[12]. Contraceptives have been aimed at women, who
bear the responsibility for child-bearing and also trad-
itionally for child-rearing. With societal shifts in gender
roles and with modern paternity testing, men have taken
on more parenting responsibility. Questions of trust in
male partners to take birth control also continue to play
into attitudes about the importance of developing male
contraceptives, yet many commenters are not aware that
as much as a quarter of the world’s population already
relies on modern or traditional male methods. These
changes are reflected in recent studies and surveys
indicating that men are not only willing to share
responsibility for contraception but demand greater
reproductive
control
[8,
12].
Even
with
increased
demand, male contraceptive development has still been
challenged by liability issues, politics, religion and lack of
public/private investment [4, 13]. While research has
explored a number of different male contraceptive op-
tions, no commercially available LARCs for men are on
the market.
A male LARC has the potential to decrease the rate of
unintended pregnancies, provide men with additional
options to control their reproduction, and offer couples
an alternative when female contraceptive methods are
problematic. Vasalgel is a promising male LARC, and
studies in rabbits prove that Vasalgel not only provides
rapid and durable contraception [9], but also a return of
spermatozoa in the ejaculate shortly after undergoing a
reversal procedure with a sodium bicarbonate solution.
In the current study the vasa deferentia of Vasalgel-
induced azoospermic rabbits were flushed with a sodium

 bicarbonate solution to reestablish patency for the trans-
port of spermatozoa. Bicarbonate solutions have been
used in previous studies to reverse a similar hydrogel in
the rat model [14, 15]. DMSO was not considered for
dissolving the hydrogel plug since it could cause in-
creased inflammation during prolonged contact with the
vas deferens [16].
Spermatozoa concentrations returned to normal after
the reversal procedure. The initially higher sperm con-
centrations were probably due to increased epididymal
sperm reserves resulting from long term blockage of
sperm transit [17, 18]. Motility also returned to baseline
levels following reversal, but forward progression was
significantly lower in the post-reversal period. A trend of
increasing forward progression values over time indi-
cated that a slow recovery process was occurring.
The normal time for spermatogenesis and transit to
epididymal reserves is about 40 days [19]. Transit time
from the testes through the epididymis is about 10 days
[19, 20]. Thus, the post reversal semen collections were
performed after a minimum of 2.5 cycles of sperm pro-
duction to ensure newly produced spermatozoa were
being ejaculated.
A lack of normal acrosomes on the spermatozoa was ob-
served throughout the post reversal semen evaluations.
Previous studies of other hydrogels indicate residual

 material in the vas lumen may also affect the spermatozoa
during transit down the vas [21–23]. The decrease in
normal forward progression and lack of normal acrosomes
may
indicate
compromised
epididymal
and/or
vasal
support of sperm maturation and transport which can lead
to reduced or complete infertility. Although the reversal
process successfully re-established the transport of sperm-
atozoa into the ejaculate, the ejaculated spermatozoa have
not returned to normal.
The impact of the post-reversal sperm characteristics
on pregnancy rates is unknown in this study since
mating with females was not included in the study
protocol. Previous work in artificial insemination in
rabbits indicated that about 10 million motile sperm per
sample were required for pregnancy [24]. In our study,
rabbits averaged 187 million motile sperm with 16.0
million sperm showing forward progression. We would
expect mating success based solely on sperm concentra-
tion
and
motility.
However,
the
reduced
forward
progression and the lack of a normal acrosome would
negatively impact fertility. Normal forward progression
and acrosomes are important predictors of fertility. The
forward progression recovery trend provides evidence
that the return to completely normal spermatozoa may
occur over a longer period of time and restore fertility.
The contact of spermatozoa with residual material
during transit through the vas deferens may have
negatively impacted morphology and functionality of the
spermatozoa as observed in previous studies with a simi-
lar material [21–23]. Fertility in man would most likely
require a return of all semen parameters to within
normal ranges.
The vasal epithelium appeared to be returning to
normal following the reversal procedure. Although some
areas were observed with epithelial attenuation and
flattening, most of the vasal epithelium appeared to have
an intact structure with normal columnar appearance
and a ciliated apical surface.
Nonetheless, all animals had spermatozoa present in
the semen following the reversal procedure to confirm
the reestablishment of patency in the vasa deferentia.
Conclusions
The blockage of sperm transit for 14 months following
Vasalgel implantation was rapidly reversed through an
intravasal injection of sodium bicarbonate. Sperm counts
returned to normal in all of the subjects over the period
of observation. Post-reversal concentration of sperm and
sperm motility percent returned to baseline levels during
the six-month follow up, with the reduced sperm for-
ward progression exhibiting a recovering trend. Normal
acrosomes were not observed over the post reversal
evaluation period. Further investigations are needed to
determine if a longer period of time would allow
complete recovery of the vasal structures or if improved
flushing procedures are needed to completely remove
the Vasalgel leading to the return of normal sperm
morphology and forward progression.
Study results support continued development of Vasalgel
as a non-hormonal LARC for men.
