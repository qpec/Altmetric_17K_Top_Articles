Sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD), the most common human prion disease, is transmissible through iatrogenic
routes due to abundant infectious prions [misfolded forms of the prion protein (PrPSc)] in the central nervous system
(CNS). Some epidemiological studies have associated sCJD risk with non-CNS surgeries. We explored the potential
prion seeding activity and infectivity of skin from sCJD patients. Autopsy or biopsy skin samples from 38 patients
[21 sCJD, 2 variant CJD (vCJD), and 15 non-CJD] were analyzed by Western blotting and real-time quaking-induced
conversion (RT-QuIC) for PrPSc. Skin samples from two patients were further examined for prion infectivity by bioassay
using two lines of humanized transgenic mice. Western blotting revealed dermal PrPSc in one of five deceased sCJD
patients and one of two vCJD patients. However, the more sensitive RT-QuIC assay detected prion seeding activity in
skin from all 23 CJD decedents but not in skin from any non-CJD control individuals (with other neurological conditions
or other diseases) during blinded testing. Although sCJD patient skin contained ~103- to 105-fold lower prion seeding
activity than did sCJD patient brain tissue, all 12 mice from two transgenic mouse lines inoculated with sCJD skin
homogenates from two sCJD patients succumbed to prion disease within 564 days after inoculation. Our study dem-
onstrates that the skin of sCJD patients contains both prion seeding activity and infectivity, which raises concerns
about the potential for iatrogenic sCJD transmission via skin.
INTRODUCTION
Priondiseasesarefatal,transmissiblespongiformencephalopathies(TSEs)
that affect humans and other animals. They are associated with the dep-
ositionofmisfoldedformsoftheprionprotein(PrPSc)inthecentralnervous
system (CNS) that propagate by seeding the multimerization and confor-
mational conversion of normal cellular prion protein (1). These misfolded
PrPconformersaretheprimaryconstituentofinfectiousTSEagents(prions).
Human prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), fatal
insomnia,Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinkersyndrome,kuru,andvariably
protease-sensitiveprionopathy(2).Theetiologycanbesporadic,acquired
by infection, or inherited. Although phenotypically heterogeneous, prion
diseases are clinically characterized by varying degrees of dementia, my-
oclonus, extrapyramidal signs, cerebellar ataxia, and pyramidal signs and
pathologically characterized by spongiform degeneration, neuronal loss,
and astrocytosis in the brain. The most common form of human prion dis-
ease, sporadic CJD (sCJD), usually has a rapid and dramatic clinical course
withameandurationoflessthan6months.MorethansixsubtypesofsCJD
can be differentiated on the basis of their clinical phenotypes, together with
the polymorphic residue at codon 129 of PrPSc [Met/Met (MM), Val/Val
(VV), or Met/Val (MV)], and distinct or coexisting PrPSc types (1 or 2)
associated with different amino terminal protease cleavage sites (3).
sCJDis transmissible iatrogenically, forexample, via CNS-associated
or cornea-associated surgical operations, or injections of brain-derived
contaminated growth hormone and gonadotropins (4). Some epidemi-
ological observations have suggested that the risk of sCJD may even be
associated with a history of having various non-CNS–related surgeries,
the number of surgeries, and the age at the time of the first surgery (5–8).
A case-control study also reported that statistically significant odds ratios
were obtained for injury to (or surgery on) the head, face, or neck and
trauma to other parts of the body (9). However, other studies reported
little correlation between surgeries and sCJD incidence (10, 11).
Although the involvement of the skin in sCJD infections remains un-
clear, proteinase K (PK)–resistant PrPSc was detectedin the skin of a single
patient with variant CJD (vCJD) (12), a distinct CJD strain that originated
from exposure to bovine spongiform encephalopathy. Here, using West-
ern blotting (13), real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay
(14),andbioassaywithhumanizedtransgenic(Tg)mice(15),wetestedfor
PrPSc and prion infectivity in skin samples from patients with sCJD.

 individuals with or without other neurological conditions (Table 1 and
table S1) (16, 17). Both skin and brain tissues were collected from 30 of
the 38 subjects, including cases with sCJD (n = 21), vCJD (n = 2), and
non-CJD patients with other neurological conditions (n = 7). The
demographic and clinical features of the patients with either sCJD or
vCJD are summarized in Table 1. The demographic characteristics
and diagnoses of non-CJD controls are provided in table S1. Patients
with sCJD had either MM, MV, or VV polymorphisms at residue
129 of the PrP sequence and either type 1, type 2, or coexisting types
1 and2 PrPSc (sCJDMM1,sCJDMM2, sCJDMV1, sCJDMV2, sCJDVV1,
sCJDVV2, sCJDMV1-2, sCJDVV1-2, or sCJDMM1-2), as determined
by Western blotting and histology of brain tissues (3). Western blotting
and neurohistology detected PrPSc and spongiform degeneration in the
brains of all of the CJD cases but not in the non-CJD controls (fig. S1
shows examples of brain tissue from five sCJD, two vCJD, and two
non-CJD patients).
Detection of PrPSc in the skin by Western blotting
and immunohistochemistry
Previously, PrPSc was barely detectable by Western blotting in a skin
sample collected postmortem from the torso area of a vCJD patient after
enrichment with sodium phosphotungstate precipitation (12, 17). We
first examined skin samples from the torso of the same vCJD patient
from the United States (US vCJD) and from the forearm of another
vCJD patient from the United Kingdom (UK vCJD) using an approach
that previously succeeded in enriching and detecting PrPSc in the skin
of animals naturally and experimentally infected with scrapie (13). After
a series of ultracentrifugation steps followed by PK treatment, the PK-
treated, PrPSc-concentrated fraction (termed P4) was obtained. PrPSc was
detectable in the US vCJD patient P4 sample on Western blots probed
with the anti-PrP antibody 3F4 against human PrP(96–112) or anti-C
antibody against human PrP(220–231) after treatment with PK with or
without peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) (Fig. 1, A and B), con-
sistent with the previous study (12). However, no PrPSc was detected
in the skin of the UK vCJD patient after the same treatment (Fig. 1C).
The amount of brain PrPSc in the two vCJD cases was compared by
Western blotting, and a six- to sevenfold lower amount was found in
the UK patient than in the U.S. patient by quantitative densitometric
analysis (Fig. 1D).
Using the same method, we next examined the PrPSc-enriched skin
samples (P4 fraction) from the apex (top of the head), an area next to
the ear, or other body areas including the forearm, torso, or leg of 5
confirmed sCJD patients and 10 non-CJD controls, using the US vCJD
skin as a positive control. After PK treatment, no PK-resistant PrP was
detectable in any of the non-CJD and sCJD skin samples except for one
sCJD case (patient no. 5), who exhibited very faint bands that were
much weaker than those shown in the vCJD skin sample positive con-
trol (patient no. 6) (Fig. 1E, top). To increase sensitivity, we treated en-
riched preparations with both PK and PNGase F before Western blot
analysis using anti-C antibody, as previously described (18). Only the
skin sample from patient no. 5 produced a deglycosylated PrPSc band
that co-migrated with the corresponding vCJD band (Fig. 1E, bottom).
Moreover, the intensity of this PrP band was about four- to fivefold
lower in the sCJD skin sample than in the US vCJD skin sample pos-
itive control (Fig. 1E), as measured by densitometric analysis of the
protein bands. These results indicated that the amount of PK-resistant
PrPSc in the skin tissues of sCJD patients was either low or undetectable
in most cases by Western blotting.
Compared to the US vCJD case, the UK vCJD patient exhibited no
Western blotting–detectable PrPSc in the skin and also a six- to seven-
fold lower amount of PrPSc in brain tissue (Fig. 1D), which may be
associated with a shorter disease duration in the UK case (18 months
for the UK vCJD patient versus 34 months for the US vCJD patient). In
sCJD patients, it has been reported that the higher amounts of brain

 PrPSc in sCJD type 2 than in sCJD type 1 could be associated with the
longer disease duration in the former than in the latter (19). Notably, the
PrPSc from the UK case showed a doublet middle band and an ungly-
cosylated PrP band that migrated slightly higher than that of the US
vCJD case. A similar middle band variation has been reported in vCJD
and sCJD by Head et al. (20). However, it is unclear why the lower
PrP band migrated slower in the UK case than in the U.S. case, although
the clinical history and neuropathology of this case were typical for the
vCJD diagnosis. In addition, immunohistochemistry of skin samples
from the two vCJD and two sCJD patients, as well as two non-CJD
controls, also revealed no specific PrPSc staining with the anti-PrP
antibody 3F4 (fig. S2 with examples of two vCJD and one non-
CJD patient samples).
Detection of prion seeding activity in CJD patient skin
samples by RT-QuIC assay
As another approach to detect PrPSc in sCJD skin samples, we used
the ultrasensitive RT-QuIC assay. This assay uses the amyloid-sensitive
fluorescent dye, thioflavin T (ThT), to monitor PrPSc-seeded formation
of amyloid fibrils from a purified recombinant PrP substrate (14, 21–23).
The same skin extracts, prepared and tested by Western blotting at the
Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), were coded and examined
blinded by RT-QuIC at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories. A 10−3 dilu-
tion of either the first supernatant (S1) or the final PK-digested and
PrPSc-enriched pellet (P4) of the skin extraction sample, as well as a
10−5 dilution of brain homogenate from the same patients, was assayed
using recombinant bank vole PrP (rPrPsen) as the substrate (Fig. 2A). As
expected (14, 22, 23), the sCJD and vCJD brain samples all elicited
strong and rapid positive RT-QuIC responses. Clear seeding activity
was also observed in all skin S1 and P4 fractions from the CJD patients.
By contrast, no prion seeding activity was observed in the brain or the
skin S1 or P4 extracts from any of the 10 non-CJD control patients,
showing that the seeding activity in the CJD patients’ brain and skin
samples was disease-specific (Fig. 2A). These findings were further con-
firmed by blinded testing of S1 fractions from skin collected from the
lower back, skull apex, and an area near the ear of each of 21 additional
cases that included 16 sCJD and 5 non-CJD cases (Fig. 2, B and C). Our
results showed that all of the CJD patients had at least one RT-QuIC–
positive skin sample (Fig. 2, B and C, and Table 2). However, no single
skin location was always RT-QuIC–positive. Of the three skin areas, the
area near the ear had the highest and most consistent prion seeding
activity (Fig. 2, B and C), that is, in 94% of sCJD cases (Table 2).
To assess the prion seeding activity in the S1 and P4 skin fractions
compared to brain homogenates from the same patients, we performed
RT-QuIC end point dilution analyses. Figure S3 shows representative
data from vCJD and sCJD patients. Table 3 provides a summary of
the calculated 50% seeding dose (SD50) per milligram of tissue from
each brain and skin sample of five patients with sCJD and two patients
with vCJD. Relative to brain concentrations of 108.0 to ≥109.7 SD50 per
milligram of tissue, the S1 skin fractions for sCJD patients contained
105.0 to 106.9 SD50 per milligram of tissue equivalent, whereas the P4
fractions had 103.0 to 104.9 SD50 per milligram of tissue equivalent. Our
analysis showed that the average prion seeding activity in sCJD S1 or P4
skin fractions was ~103- to 105-fold lower than in the corresponding
brain tissue samples.
Discrimination of prion seeding activity by RT-QuIC in sCJD
and vCJD patient skin samples
To further investigate the different seeding capabilities present in skin
extracts from sCJD and vCJD patients, we analyzed P4 skin fractions
from the sCJD and vCJD patients using a second rPrPsen substrate,
hamster rPrPsen (residues 23 to 231), which was previously shown to
help discriminate between these two human prion strains from brain
tissues (21). PrPSc in both sCJD and vCJD skin samples could be am-
plified by bank vole rPrPsen substrate (Fig. 3A), but only the sCJD skin
samples gave positive reactions with the hamster rPrPsen substrate (Fig.
3B). However, the P4 skin fractions from sCJD patient no. 3 and vCJD
patient no. 7 were not included in this analysis because of the low
amount of prion seeding activity that diminished the reliability of
discrimination between the two strains. Nevertheless, these results
provide further evidence that, as we described previously for brain
samples, sCJD and vCJD seeding activities in skin could be discrimi-
nated by comparing differential RT-QuIC responses with bank vole

 and hamster rPrPsen substrates, provided that the seeding activities
detected with the bank vole rPrPsen substrate were not close to the
detection limit. Western blot analyses of the products of RT-QuIC
reactions with the bank vole rPrPsen substrate revealed variable
patterns of PK-resistant reaction products; however, it was not ap-
parent that such patterns would aid additionally in CJD strain or
type discrimination (fig. S4).
Prion infectivity in skin samples from sCJD patients detected
in humanized Tg mice
To determine whether skin from sCJD patients was infectious, we
conducted a bioassay using two lines of humanized Tg mice (TgNN6h
and TgWV), which were generated in our laboratories previously.
TgNN6h mice express human PrP-129M with the two N-linked
glycosylation sites mutated to eliminate glycosylation (24), whereas

reactions were seeded in quadruplicate with a 10−4 dilution of brain tissue from patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and a 10−3 dilution
of S1 or P4 skin fractions from non-CJD patient nos. 8 to 17. A final SDS concentration of 0.001% in combination with 300 mM NaCl was used with recombinant bank vole PrP
(rPrPsen) as the substrate. Similar results were seen in at least two independent experiments. Traces from representative RT-QuIC experiments are the average of percent thioflavin

 TgWV mice express wild-type human PrP-129V (25). We observed
that TgNN6h and TgWV mice were susceptible to sCJDMM2 or
sCJDVV2 prion strains, respectively, after an intracerebral inocula-
tion of 129 polymorphism-matched sCJD brain homogenates; this
was confirmed by Western blotting (fig. S5). TgNN6h mice (n = 7)
each inoculated intracerebrally with 30 ml of 1% brain homogenate
from a sCJDMM2 patient developed prion disease at an average of
263 ± 25 (SD) days post inoculation (dpi) (range, 164 to 368 dpi).
By contrast, TgWV mice (n = 5) each inoculated intracerebrally
with 30 ml of 1% brain homogenate from a sCJDVV2 patient suc-
cumbed to the disease at an average of 157 ± 11 (SD) dpi (range,
150 to 177 dpi). Given these studies, five TgNN6h mice and seven
TgWV mice were inoculated intracerebrally with 30 ml of 5% skin
tissue homogenate from a sCJDMM2 case (patient no. 4; Table 3)
or a sCJDVV1 case (patient no. 1; Table 3), respectively. All five
TgNN6h mice inoculated with the sCJDMM2 skin homogenate de-
veloped a hunched back, ruffled fur, and lethargy/slow movements
after an average of 370 ± 51 (SD) dpi (range, 300 to 417 dpi) (Fig. 4A);
these signs were very similar to those observed in TgNN6h mice in-
oculated with sCJDMM2 brain homogenate. We also detected PK-
resistant PrPSc and spongiform degeneration in the brains of these
TgNN6h mice (Fig. 4, B and D). All seven TgWV mice inoculated
with sCJDVV1 skin homogenate became infected at an average of
436 ± 80 (SD) dpi (range, 332 to 564 dpi) (Fig. 4A), as confirmed by
Western blotting and neurohistology (Fig. 4, C and E). The TgWV
mice mostly exhibited slow movements and weight gain and had
detectable PK-resistant PrPSc and spongiform degeneration in the
brain (Fig. 4E). The gel migration pattern of PrPSc detected in the
brains of mice inoculated with sCJD skin samples was very similar
to that of PrPSc from mice inoculated with sCJD brain tissue, sug-
gesting that at least some of the prion strain-specific biochemical fea-
tures of the inocula were maintained (Fig. 4C). Moreover, the profiles
of spongiform degeneration and PrP staining in the brains of skin
homogenate–inoculated mice were also similar to those of brain
homogenate–inoculated mice (Fig. 4, D and E). By contrast, all seven
TgWV mice inoculated with normal skin homogenate from a non-
CJD patient carrying the 129V/V genotype of PrP were overweight,
but none of the mice became infected, and no PrPSc was detected in
any of the mice at 564 dpi (Fig. 4, C and E). In addition, TgNN6h con-
trol mice that were not inoculated exhibited a normal life span and did
not display any obvious abnormal phenotypes.
DISCUSSION
Our study demonstrates the presence of prion infectivity, seeding
activity, and, in one case, PK-resistant PrPSc in the skin of sCJD
patients. Although we have not completed the direct comparison of
the infectivity of PrPSc from sCJD brain and skin by bioassay in
humanized Tg mice, our RT-QuIC assays indicated that prion seeding
activity was approximately 1000-fold lower in the skin than in the brain
of the same patient. These seed concentrations are similar to those
found in nasal brushings from CJD patients (26). Given the observed
partial correlation between seeding activity and infectivity (14, 27), we
predict that sCJD infectivity is also orders of magnitude lower in the
skin than in the brain of CJD patients.
The tissue distribution of prions can differ markedly between prion
diseases, and prion detection in various tissues depends in part on the
sensitivity of the assays used. For example, using Western blot analysis,
PrPSc was found to be more widely distributed in the periphery of

 patients with vCJD than sCJD patients (28, 29). However, using the
more sensitive RT-QuIC assay, sCJD seeding activity was recently
detected in nonneuronal tissues such as the spleen, kidney, lung, liver,
and adrenal glands of four sCJD patients (30). We have detected roughly
comparable RT-QuIC prion seeding activity, as well as prion infectivity,
in the skin of cases with two sCJD subtypes (MM2 and VV1). Whether
PrPSc in skin from cases of the most common sCJD subtype (MM1) is
also transmissible to experimental animals remains to be determined;
however, our RT-QuIC analyses indicated at least equivalent seeding
activity in sCJDMM1 skin (Table 3). Our current results raise concerns
about iatrogenic transmission of prions harbored in sCJD skin. For ex-
ample, the presence of transmissible skin prions raises the question of
the presence of other possible iatrogenic routes of CJD, although the
epidemiologic evidence for this varies widely and has largely been in-
conclusive (5–11).
We should emphasize that in no way does our study imply that
prion transmission can occur via casual contact. The bioassays that we
have performed involved inoculation of relatively large amounts of
skin extracts directly into the brains of humanized Tg mice, which is
not likely to be recapitulated in humans in any sort of routine event.
Prion transmission from skin in humans, if even possible, likely re-
quires additional specific inoculation scenarios that have existed in
documented iatrogenic transmissions of human prion disease, that is,
CNS injection, hematogenous spread, or oral consumption with suf-
ficient quantities of infectious material (4). The apparent rarity of such
scenarios in routine clinical care may be responsible for the lower than
expected hazard ratios of certain procedures discussed in some epide-
miological studies compared to the much higher risks associated with
known modes of iatrogenic CJD transmission. In addition, the rate of
skin-associated transmission, if present, would likely be much lower
than that of CNS-associated transmission, given the much lower
RT-QuIC prion seeding activity in the skin than in the brains of sCJD
cases. Nevertheless, further scrutiny is necessary to determine whether
extra precautions should be taken during non-CNS surgeries of sCJD
patients, especially in the case of procedures where surgical instruments
are reused.
As noted above, the detection of prions and PrPSc in skin is not
altogether unprecedented. PrPSc has been detected in the skin of
experimentally or naturally scrapie-infected hamsters and sheep
(13), as well as in the skin of a single patient with vCJD (12). Prion
infectivity has also been reported in the skin of infected greater kudu
(31). In addition, mouse prion inoculation by skin scarification has
been found to have almost the same efficiency as inoculation by the
intraperitoneal, intravenous, or perivenous routes (32). The inoculated
prions first propagate in the skin and then spread to the brain to cause
prion disease (33, 34). All of these modes of prion spread between the
brain and the skin are believed to occur via the peripheral nervous
system. PrPSc has been detected in the trigeminal ganglion in sCJD
and vCJD patients by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting
(35) and in the nerve fibers within the skin of hamsters inoculated
with the 263K prion strain by immunohistochemistry (13). The der-
matomes examined in our study including the skull apex, the area near
the ear, the forearm, and the lower back are innervated by the oculo-
motor nerve III ophthalmic division, cervical nerves 2 to 3 (C2-3), C5,
or thoracic nerves 10 to 11, respectively. It is possible that prions
spread from the brain to the dermatomes through these spinal nerves.
In conclusion, we have detected prions in the skin of the sCJD cases
that we have tested but not in non-CJD control individuals. However,
our study does not establish when and where within the skin prions
appear in the course of disease. Moreover, other than the indication that
prion seeding activity is ~1000-fold lower in the skin than in brain
tissue, our data do not clarify the basis of seemingly divergent epidemi-
ologic reports on sCJD risks, or lack thereof, associated with surgical
procedures involving the skin. We have not yet validated that RT-QuIC

and vCJD patients. P4 skin fractions from the sCJD and vCJD patients were analyzed
using a second rPrPsen substrate, hamster rPrPsen (residues 23 to 231), which has been
previously shown to help discriminate between these two human prion strains (21).
Dilutions (10−3) of P4 skin fractions from four sCJD patients (nos. 1, 2, 4, and 5) and
1 vCJD patient (no. 6) were used to seed quadruplicate RT-QuIC reactions. Testing
was performed using either bank vole rPrPsen in the presence of 300 mM NaCl and
0.001% SDS (A) or hamster rPrPsen in the presence of 300 mM NaCl and 0.002% SDS
(B). Testing was performed twice with similar results. The data show the average fluo-
rescence of replicate wells monitored over time.

 analysis of skin would have practical utility in the diagnosis of sCJD.
Further studies are needed to clarify the risks associated with skin
samples from sCJD patients and to increase our understanding of prion
transmissibility.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The aim of the study was to determine whether there are infectious
prions in the skin of sCJD patients. The skin samples were collected
at autopsy or biopsy from different body areas of 38 patients including
21sCJD, 2 vCJD, and 15non-CJD. The abnormal PrP fromthe skin was
enriched by ultracentrifugation before Western blotting analysis. More-
over, concentrated or unconcentrated PrP from skin and brain samples
was further subjected to the highly sensitive RT-QuIC assay in a blinded
fashion. Finally, to determine whether the sCJD skin is infectious, we
conducted a bioassay with two lines of humanized Tg mice inoculated
intracerebrally with skin homogenates from two sCJD patients and one
non-CJD patient. In addition to monitoring the clinical signs of the in-
oculated animals, the brain samples of the mice were examined by
Western blotting and neurohistology. Samples were collected randomly
according to the diagnosis by Western blotting and histology. All data
on Western blotting and RT-QuIC assay of human brain and skin
samples were repeated at least two to three times. To ensure that the
bioassay data were reliable, we used two different sCJD cases and one
non-CJD case, as well as two different humanized Tg mouse models.
Patients
Thirty-seven patients including 21 sCJD, 1 vCJD (US vCJD), and 15
non-CJD individualswere obtained through ourNationalPrionDisease
Pathology Surveillance Center and Human Tissue Procurement Facility
in the Department of Pathology at CWRU. An additional vCJD case
(UK vCJD) was obtained from the National CJD Research and Surveil-
lance Unit, University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom (part of the Med-
ical Research Council Edinburgh Brain Bank). The study was monitored
and approved by the University Hospitals Case Medical Center Institu-
tional Review Board. The diagnosis of CJD was confirmed by Western
blotting and neurohistology of the brain samples obtained at autopsy.
CJDincluded10malesand13females[meanage,59.4±15.3(SD)years]
(Table 1). The 15 non-CJD control patients comprised nine males and
six females [mean age, 65.1 ± 14.2 (SD) years] (table S1).
Brain tissue and preparation
Brain tissues were obtained at autopsy from 30 patients including 21
sCJD, 2 vCJD, and 7 non-CJD individuals and processed for Western
blotting with anti-PrP antibody 3F4 against human PrP(106–112)
(18, 36) or RT-QuIC analysis, as described previously (14, 21, 37) with
minor modifications (see the Supplementary Materials for details).
Skin tissues and preparation
Thirty-five of the 38 skin samples were obtained at autopsy, and the
remaining three samples were biopsied. The skin samples (~60 to
80 mg each in weight, ~6 mm × 6 mm each in size) contained all three
layers including epidermis, dermis, and hypodermis from different parts
of the body such as the apex, area next to left ear (~1 cm away from the
ear), forearm, chest, lower back, and knee. During the autopsy process,
special care was taken to assure that there was no cross contamination
between the skin and the brain samples and from case to case. All skin
tissues were taken before the skull was opened. The instruments were
either virgin or used only for collecting skin after decontamination each
time. The autopsied or biopsied tissues were taken at nine different facil-
ities and frozen in dry ice first and then transferred to a freezer at −80°C.
The frozen skin samples were prepared for Western blot analysis prob-
ing with anti-PrP antibody 3F4 or anti-C against human PrP(220–231)
(12, 13, 18, 36), for RT-QuIC analysis (14), or as inocula for bioassay, as
described previously (15) with minor modifications (see the Supplemen-
tary Materials for details).
Molecular genetic analysis
These analyses were performed on genomic DNA, as described previ-
ously (15, 38) and in the Supplementary Materials.
RT-QuIC analysis
The RT-QuIC analysis of skin or brain samples was conducted, as de-
scribed previously (14, 21, 26, 37) and in the Supplementary Materials.
Generation, screening, and characterization of Tg
humanized TgWV and TgNN6h mice
The generation of Tg mice expressing human PrP-129V or PrP-129M
from transgene constructs based on the murine half-genomic PrP clone
in plasmid pHGPRP was performed, as described previously (15, 24, 25)
and in the Supplementary Materials.
Humanized Tg mouse–based bioassay of skin or brain
samples from sCJD patients
Infectivity of sCJD skin samples was evaluated by intracerebral inocu-
lation of TgNN6h or TgWV mice with 5% skin tissue homogenate from
one patient with sCJDMM2 or sCJDVV1, respectively. The reason that
the two lines of humanized Tg mice were chosen for testing the two
sCJD skin samples was because our preliminary study exhibited that
they were highly susceptible to the 129 polymorphism-matched sCJD
brain inocula. After anesthetization with isoflurane, 30 ml of 5% skin
homogenate or 30 ml of 1% brain homogenate (in phosphate-buffered
saline) was injected into each mouse intracerebrally with a 26-gauge
needle inserted to a depth of 4 mm at the left parietal region of the cra-
nium, as described previously (15). The mice were monitored for prion-
related signs such as hunched back, ruffled fur, rigid tails, and slow
movement every other day and sacrificed within 3 days after the appear-
ance of severe signs or at death. The brains were collected and sliced
sagittally—half of which was frozen for Western blotting with the anti-
PrP antibody 3F4 (18, 36), and the other half was fixed in 10% formalin
for histological and immunohistochemical staining analysis (see below).
Total PrP, as well as PK-treated PrPSc, was determined by immuno-
blotting in SDS–polyacrylamide gels, as described in the Supplementary
Materials.
Statistical analysis
Statistical comparisons of mean relative ThT fluorescence responses in
samples from CJD and non-CJD patients were performed using un-
paired Student’s t tests.
