Abstract.
Few data are available on the burden of malaria hospitalization in the United States. Study of malaria using
hospital-based data can better define the impact of malaria and help inform prevention efforts. U.S. malaria cases
identified from hospitalization discharge records in the 2000–2014 Nationwide Inpatient Sample were examined. Fre-
quencies and population rates were reported by demographics, infecting species, clinical, financial, institutional, geo-
graphic, and seasonal characteristics, and disparities were identified. Time trends in malaria cases were assessed using
negative binomial regression. From 2000 to 2014, there were an estimated 22,029 malaria-related hospitalizations
(4.88 per 1 million population) in the United States, including 182 in-hospital deaths and 4,823 severe malaria cases. The
rate of malaria-related hospitalizations did not change significantly over the study period. The largest number of malaria-
related hospitalizations occurred in August. Malaria-related hospitalizations occurred disproportionately among patients
who were male, black, or 25–44 years of age. Plasmodium falciparum accounted for the majority of malaria-related
hospitalizations. On average, malaria patients were hospitalized for 4.36 days with charges of $25,789. Patients with a
malaria diagnosis were more often hospitalized in the Middle Atlantic and South Atlantic census divisions, urban teaching,
private not-for-profit, and large-bed-size hospitals. Malaria imposes a substantial disease burden in the United States.
Enhanced primary and secondary prevention measures, including strategies to increase the use ofpretravel consultations
and prompt diagnosis and treatment are needed.
INTRODUCTION
Malaria is the leading cause of death by parasitic disease in
the world and remains one of the most important and in-
tractable global public health problems. An estimated
212 million cases of malaria, and 429,000 deaths due to
malaria occurred in 2015.1 Malaria is caused by infection
with the protozoan agents of the genus Plasmodium. Sev-
eral species of Plasmodium (Plasmodium falciparum, Plas-
modium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, Plasmodium malariae, and
Plasmodium knowlesi) are known to affect humans, with
P. falciparum causing the most morbidity and the vast ma-
jority of the mortality. Transmission typically occurs through
the bite from an infected female Anopheles mosquito, which
has widespread distribution throughout the world, including
the United States. Malaria transmission can also occur by
blood transfusion, organ transplant, percutaneous expo-
sure, and vertically (from mother to fetus), though these
forms of transmission are uncommon.2
If untreated, malaria can cause severe and fatal disease.
Clinical manifestations can range from fever, shaking chills,
muscle pains, and other nonspecific symptoms in un-
complicated malaria, to jaundice, acute renal failure, severe
anemia, cerebral malaria, acute respiratory distress syn-
drome (ARDS), and other serious complications in severe
malaria,2 which can be rapidly fatal. Malaria during preg-
nancy is associated with many adverse outcomes, including
maternal mortality, maternal anemia, low birth weight, in-
trauterine growth retardation, and fetal loss.3
In recent years, despite increasing antimalarial drug and
vector resistance, the scale-up of interventions in the
endemic areas of the world has encouragingly reduced the
estimated global malaria incidence by 41% and mortality by
62% from 2000 to 2015.1,4 However, the number of imported
malaria cases has steadily increased in the United States,5
where previously endemic malaria was eliminated in the
1950s. Similar to other countries6 that eliminated malaria,
this increase has mostly occurred among returned trav-
elers, as well as among foreign visitors and immigrants from
malaria-endemic countries.7 Imported cases pose the po-
tential threat for reintroduction of malaria into the naturally
present Anopheles population in the United States.8 Many
documented outbreaks of autochthonous malaria fueled by
returned travelers, migrant workers, and immigrants have
occurred in the United States since malaria was declared
eliminated.9
Malaria is a nationally reportable disease in the United
States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) maintains a highly regarded surveillance system
of confirmed (positive microscopy or polymerase chain
reaction [PCR]) or suspected (positive rapid diagnostic test
without microscopy or PCR confirmation) malaria cases.
The surveillance data are used to provide annual general
malaria status updates, to detect local transmission, to
monitor the patterns of resistance to antimalarial drugs,
and to guide malaria prevention recommendations for in-
ternational travelers.5 However, with possible under-
reporting of malaria in the current passive surveillance
systems,10,11 the complete domestic burden of malaria
remains unknown.
Epidemiological study of malaria using hospital data can
complement the findings from current nationwide surveil-
lance system data to elucidate the malaria disease burden
and case characteristics, and provide insight into the health-
care utilization and outcomes for malaria in the United
States. We report the analysis of malaria-related hospitali-
zations in the United States from 2000 to 2014.

 MATERIALS AND METHODS
Hospital discharge records from the Nationwide Inpatient
Sample (NIS) were used for analysis of malaria-related hos-
pitalizations in the United States during 2000–2014. The NIS is
sampled from the State Inpatient Databases, and is part of the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) sponsored by
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The NIS is
the largest publically available all-payer inpatient data source
in the United States, and each annual NIS dataset contains
about 7–8 million hospital discharge records (about 20%) and
over 100 clinical and nonclinical data elements, including
sociodemographics, admission characteristics, diagnosis
type, length of stay, codiagnoses, procedures performed, in-
stitutionalcharacteristics,andtotalcharges.12,13For2000–2011
data, the NIS was a stratified, single-stage cluster sampling of
U.S. community hospitals, in which all of the discharges from
the selected hospitals were included in the NIS dataset.12 For
2012–2014 data, the NIS was a stratified random sample of
discharges from all community hospitals participating in
HCUP.13 Details on the sampling scheme have been de-
scribed elsewhere.12,13
Cases of malaria from 2000 to 2014 were identified from
discharge records in the NIS by the primary and secondary
diagnoses, which used the International Classification of
Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9)14 codes of 084.0–084.9
(084.0: falciparum malaria, malignant tertian; 084.1: vivax
malaria, benign tertian; 084.2: malariae, quartan; 084.3:
ovale malaria; 084.4: other malaria; 084.5: mixed malaria;
084.6: malaria, unspecified; 084.7: induced malaria; 084.8:
Blackwater fever; 084.9: other pernicious complications of
malaria) and of 647.4 (malaria complicating pregnancy,
childbirth, or puerperium).
In this study, the definition of severe malaria was modified
from that used by the CDC.5 Since no specific drugs used or
laboratory results are available in the NIS, we were unable to
use parasitemia ³ 5% or treatment of severe malaria (i.e.,
artesunate or quinidine) as specified in the CDC definition.5
Malaria complications were identified using ICD-9 codes and
HCUP Clinical Classification Software (CCS)13 categories,
which are clinically meaningful categories of ICD-9 codes.
Discharge records listing a malaria diagnosis along with one or
more of the following criteria were considered as severe
malaria cases: 1) neurologic symptoms (cerebral malaria)—
CCS codes 82, 83, 85, or 95 (paralysis, epilepsy, convulsions,
alteration of consciousness, coma, stupor, brain damage,
other nervous system disorders); 2) renal failure—CCS code
157; 3) severe anemia—CCS code 59 (deficiency anemia) with
procedural CCS code 222 (blood transfusion); 4) ARDS—CCS
code 131; 5) jaundice—ICD-9 code 782.4; or 6) exchange
transfusion—ICD-9 code 99.01. Malaria-related hospitaliza-
tions with an in-hospital death were also considered as severe
malaria cases.
Data analyses were performed using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) with survey procedures that accounted for the
complex sampling design. Variables of interest included de-
mographics, infecting species, clinical, financial, institutional,
geographic, and seasonal characteristics. National estimates
of the frequency of malaria-related hospitalizations were
produced using NIS discharge-level sample weights, which
are provided by HCUP. Rates per U.S. population16 were
calculated using bridged-race U.S. census population
estimates. Trends over the period in the counts of malaria
cases by different patient characteristics were assessed using
negative binomial regression offset by the population.
RESULTS
From 2000 to 2014, there were an estimated 22,029
(95% confidence interval [CI] = 21,001–23,057) malaria-
related hospitalizations in the United States, which far out-
numbered that of other travel-associated diseases, including
filariasis, dengue, schistosomiasis, trypanosomiasis, and
leishmaniasis (Table 1).
An average of 1,469 malaria-related hospitalizations oc-
curred each year at a rate of 4.88 (95% CI = 4.50–5.26) per
1 million population. The rate of malaria-related hospitaliza-
tions did not change significantly over the study period.
Malaria-related hospitalizations peaked in 2010, with 2,070
(95% CI = 1,533–2,607) cases and a rate of 6.69 (95% CI =
4.96–8.43) per 1 million population (Figure 1). The largest
number of malaria-related hospitalizations occurred in Au-
gust, followed by a small peak in January (Figure 2).
Demographics. The proportion and rate of malaria-related
hospitalizations was higher for males (60.1%; 5.97 per 1 mil-
lion population [95% CI = 5.65–6.28]) than females (39.4%;
3.78 per 1 million population [95% CI = 3.55–4.02]). Pregnant
women accounted for 5.5% of the overall, and 14.0% of the
female malaria-related hospitalizations. The most common
race/ethnic group was black, accounting for over half (52.5%)
of all malaria-related hospitalizations with known race in-
formation, followed by white (24.0%), Hispanic (6.3%),
Asian/Pacific Islander (5.9%), and Native American (0.9%).
Blacks (16.98 per 1 million population [95% CI = 15.68–18.28])
also had the highest rates of malaria-related hospitalizations
compared with all of the other race/ethnic groups, whereas
whites (1.49 per 1 million population [95% CI = 1.38–1.60]) had
the lowest rates. Rates for Hispanics decreased over the pe-
riod (P < 0.01). The mean age of patients with a malaria di-
agnosis was 37.0 (95% CI = 36.4–37.6). The number and rate
of malaria-related hospitalizations increased with age, peak-
ing at 25–44 years, then decreased (Table 2).
Species. Species information was known for about half
(52.9%) of the malaria-related hospitalizations. Plasmodium
falciparum(72.9%)accountedforthemajorityofmalaria-related
hospitalizations with known species information, followed by
P. vivax (22.4%), P. malariae (3.1%), and P. ovale (2.8%). Few
specified more than one malaria species (1.2%) or listed mixed
malaria (2.0%) as a diagnosis. Unspecified malaria accounted
for 34.8% of all malaria-related hospitalizations (Table 3).
Clinical characteristics. The majority (70.0%) of malaria
patients with known source of admission were admitted from
the emergency room. There were an estimated 4,823
(95% CI = 4,485–5,161) hospitalizations that were classified
as having severe malaria, accounting for 22.0% of all malaria-
related hospitalizations. Some (21.7%) patients with severe
malaria developed multiple complications. Malaria with renal
failure (9.6%; 2,113 [95% CI = 1,903–2,324]) was the most
common complication, followed by malaria with severe ane-
mia (7.2%; 1,587 [95% CI = 1,409–1,766]), cerebral malaria
(4.3%; 956 [95% CI = 819–1,093]), malaria with ARDS (4.1%;
900 [95% CI = 766–1,034]), malaria with jaundice (3.7%;
808 [95% CI = 679–937]), and malaria with an in-hospital death
(0.8%; 182 [95% CI = 123–241]) (Table 3). The proportion and
214
KHUU AND OTHERS
 rate of malaria-related hospitalizations classified as severe
increased over the period (P < 0.01).
Discharge records with a malaria-related diagnosis listed a
mean of 5.5 (95% CI = 5.4–5.7) diagnoses, with a mean of 2.1
(95% CI = 2.1–2.2) chronic conditions.15 Most (83.1%)
malaria-related discharge records listed malaria as the pri-
mary diagnosis. Among discharge records with malaria listed
as the primary diagnosis, the most common codiagnoses
were thrombocytopenia (31.5%), anemia (17.8%), hypoka-
lemia (12.6%), and hypertension (12.5%). Among discharge
records with malaria listed as a secondary diagnosis,
the most common primary diagnoses were unspecified
septicemia (13.9%), fever (4.6%), and other specified septice-
mia (3.9%). The most common procedures performed for
malaria patients were blood transfusion (10.0%), other thera-
peutic procedures (6.9%), diagnostic spinal tap (5.2%), non-
heartvascularcatheterization(5.1%),andrespiratoryintubation
and mechanical ventilation (3.3%). Malaria patients stayed an
average of 4.36 (95% CI = 4.21–4.50) days.
Financial characteristics. The mean hospital charge for
malaria-related hospitalizations was $25,789 (95% CI =
24,478–27,101). Over half of patients resided in a zip code
with median household incomes above the national median.
Private insurance (45.1%) was the largest primary payer for

MALARIA HOSPITALIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES
215
 malaria-related hospitalizations, followed by out-of-pocket pay-
ers (21.6%), Medicaid (19.3%), and Medicare (6.9%) (Table 4).
Institutional characteristics. From 2000 to 2014, the
southern (37.1%) and northeastern (34.2%) regions of the
United States had the highest numbers of malaria-related
hospitalizations, followed by the western (14.6%) and mid-
western (14.2%) regions. The Middle Atlantic (27.2%; 9.82 per
1 million population [95% CI = 8.76–10.87]) and South Atlantic
(24.9%; 6.33 per 1 million population [95% CI = 5.65–7.00])
census divisions accounted for over half of all malaria-related
hospitalizations over the study period. The East South Central
census division had the lowest rate of malaria-related hospi-
talizations (2.1%; 1.70 per 1 million population [95% CI =
1.24–2.16]) (Figure 3).
Patients with a malaria diagnosis were more often hos-
pitalized at urban teaching hospitals (67.7%), than urban
nonteaching (28.7%) or rural (3.7%) hospitals; at private,
not-for-profit hospitals (73.1%), than government, non-
federal (18.8%) and private, investor-owned (8.2%) hospi-
tals; and at hospitals with large bed size (60.9%) than
medium (28.4%) or small (10.7%) bed size.
DISCUSSION
Malaria hospitalizations routinely occur in the United
States, and the associated burden from morbidity and mor-
tality is substantial. From 2000 to 2014, hospitalizations for
malaria far outnumbered that of other travel-associated

 diseases. Although we are unable to ascertain travel status, it
is likely that most malaria hospitalizations represent travel-
related cases, which are largely preventable.
This study indicates possible underreporting and under-
ascertainmentof malariacases anddeaths,whichareexpected
inpassive surveillance systems. Insome years (2000,2001,and
2010) during the study period, the number of malaria-related
hospitalizations exceeded the total number of malaria cases
reported by the malaria surveillance system,5 which includes
both inpatient and outpatient cases. If it is assumed that hos-
pital cases represented about 69% of all malaria cases, as
was consistently reported in recent malaria surveillance
reports,5,17,18 and the actual number of hospitalizations are as
reported in this study, then the total number of malaria cases
occurring in the United States may be closer to about 2,128
each year on average. From 2000 to 2013 (most recent sur-
veillance data available), the total number of malaria-related in-
hospital deaths in the NIS was slightly higher than the total

MALARIA HOSPITALIZATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES

 number of malaria-related deaths in the national Multiple Cause
of Death data from U.S. death certificates (N = 168),19 which
was nearly double the number reported in the national malaria
surveillance reports (N = 86).5,17,18,20–30 Further, only about
64% of death certificates listing malaria as a cause of death
reported an inpatient medical facility as the place of death on
the death certificate.19
A strong overall increasing trend in the number of reported
malaria cases in the United States5 and other countries6 that
eliminated malaria has been reported since the early 1970s,
which is likely due to the increase in international travel to
malaria-endemic regions.31 Although we did not find a sta-
tistically significant trend in malaria-related hospitalizations
from 2000 to 2014, the overall numbers generally reflected the
patterns reported in surveillance reports.11
The overrepresentation of malaria among men has been
well documented. Compared with women, men may be less
likely to seek pretravel advice, less likely to adhere to ap-
propriate personal vector avoidance and chemoprophy-
laxis, suffer more mosquito bites, and exhibit other high-risk
behaviors.32,33 The relatively large proportion of pregnant
women among female malaria-related hospitalizations
is concerning as malaria during pregnancy can be dan-
gerous for the mother and fetus.3 The age distribution of
malaria patients, which may reflect the age distribution
of international travelers, is also consistent with pre-
vious reports.5 The race/ethnicity distribution of malaria
in the United States has been infrequently reported. The
overrepresentation of malaria among blacks may reflect
the distribution of international travel among visitors,

KHUU AND OTHERS
 immigrants, or expatriates from endemic areas, including
countries in the Caribbean and Africa.5 Some immigrants
may be more likely to return to their countries of origin with
endemic malaria to visit friends or relatives, and tend to
have longer stays or stay at familial communities with
higher risk lodging that increases their exposure to
vectors.6,34 Importantly, these individuals may perceive
themselves to be immune or at low risk, and may forego
malaria prevention measures.34
The predominant infecting species for malaria-related
hospitalizations
with
known
species
information
was
P. falciparum, consistent with its well-documented relative
virulence and global distribution.5 Although all malaria
species can cause severe malaria, infection by P. falciparum
is more likely to result in severe disease because it lacks
preference for particular red blood cell age classes,35 and is
associated with sequestration and cytoadherence.36 Al-
though P. falciparum is recognized for its ability to cause
serious morbidity and mortality and is confirmed as the
primary threat in this study, the disease burden caused by
P. vivax is sizeable and should not be discounted.37,38 The
reasons for not ascertaining the infecting species for nearly
half of malaria-related hospitalizations are not known, as
species information is important in determining the appro-
priate treatment regimen.39 Improved reporting or additional
laboratory training on malaria microscopy may be needed to
improve the rates or capacity of species identification in the
United States.
The proportion of hospitalizations classified as having
severe malaria was slightly higher than that reported from the
surveillance system in recent years,11 which is expected
since hospitalized cases are selected for severity and ex-
clude milder outpatient cases. The relative proportions of
specific complications that defined severe malaria observed
were consistent with surveillance data. The number of in-
hospital deaths observed underscores the importance of
prevention and early diagnosis. Available treatment regi-
mens for malaria are highly effective when properly and
promptly administered, and symptoms can resolve within
days.39
Large geographical disparities consistent with surveillance
data were found along the east coast, which may be due to the
popularity of the northeastern region states as destinations for
immigrants from malaria-endemic countries, and thus an in-
creased popularity of malaria-endemic countries as travel
destinations for those visiting friends and relatives among res-
idents of the northeastern region.40,41 Additional provider
training for malaria awareness, diagnosis, and management
may be warranted in these areas. Improved public health
messagesandadequateaccesstoqualitypretravelclinicalcare
are needed to increase the use of pretravel consultations,
chemoprophylaxis, and vector avoidance,32,42–44 particularly
among those returning to countries of origin to visit friends or
relatives.6,36 Improvements in secondary prevention by rec-
ognition, diagnosis, and treatment in primary care are also
needed to avert the development of more severe conditions
requiring hospitalization. Prompt diagnosis and treatment is
crucial for good prognosis. Febrile illness with a history of in-
ternational travel must always include malaria as a diagnostic
consideration. Physician index of suspicion should be espe-
cially heightened during the summer and winter holiday sea-
sons, which are popular travel times of the year to Africa.45
Some limitations of this study should be considered. The
national estimates from the NIS are subject to coding and
sampling errors, and the actual number of malaria-related
hospitalizations may be greater or less than that reported
here. Error in the estimation of the malaria-related hospi-
talization frequency and rate is possible due to misdiag-
noses as malaria is a rare disease in the United States often
presenting with nonspecific clinical manifestations. Un-
derestimates are possible since malaria can be difficult to
diagnose, often requiring a skilled microscopist.46 Over-
estimates may result from incorrect diagnoses based on
clinical suspicion alone without laboratory confirmation or
misinterpretation of inappropriate diagnostic tests (e.g.,
enzyme-linked
immunosorbent
assay
antibody
test).
Underreporting of potentially relevant diagnoses and the
high proportion of clinically imprecise ICD diagnosis codes,
such as those corresponding to “general,” “other,” “un-
specified,” or “mixed” conditions, or those corresponding
to conditions that can have a wide clinical spectrum (e.g.,
renal failure), precludes accurate identification of all
malaria-related hospitalizations, of relevant clinical mani-
festations for classifying severe malaria cases, and of the
infecting species. Since this administrative data are dis-
charge record based and not patient based, hospital
transfers and recrudescent malaria cases that result in
rehospitalizations may lead to multiple counting. Although
the random and intentional (state-level suppression) miss-
ing data on race may not affect relative proportions, race-
specific frequency and rate estimates are underestimated
since only cases with known race were included in the
calculations. Factors of interest not available in the NIS
included laboratory results, specific diagnostic and treat-
ment method, and other items on medical charts that could
indicate possible coding errors. Travel history, place of birth
and immigration status, destination and purpose of in-
ternational travel, and chemoprophylaxis use were also not
available in NIS data to assess as possible risk factors.
In conclusion, this study brings to light the sizeable burden of
malaria hospitalizations in the United States. Despite the re-
duction of malaria incidence in developing countries, malaria
continues to be an important public health problem in the United
States despite its elimination in the early 1950s, and the disease
burden remains substantial. Malaria hospitalizations and deaths
are largely preventable through use of personal protective
measures, adherence to correct chemoprophylactic regimens,
and ensuring rapid and correct diagnosis and treatment. CDC
provides free guidance on malaria risk and prophylaxis by re-
gion, and staff is available for guidance on therapy.
