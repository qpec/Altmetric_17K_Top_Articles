One of the first APCs developed, the Burch-Schneider APC, 
 
reported variable survival rates at 10- to 15-year follow-up, 
ranging from 70%-90% survivorship (8, 10-14). With a lack of 
consistency in results, the Richards Contour APC was devel-
oped with hopes of improving upon the Burch-Schneider de-
sign by including an additional posterior flange for additional 
fixation, extended superolateral coverage, and a porous-coat-
ed backside in order to promote bony in-growth (15). While 
theoretically better, clinical outcomes remained similar to the 
Burch-Schneider APC, with comparable rates in regards to 
complications, loosening, and failure (16). Despite improved 
design features including additional fixation and coverage, 
the results of acetabular reconstruction have not improved. 
The purpose of this study was to use radiographic and clinical 
data from retrieved Contour APCs to determine specific pat-
terns and risk factors for failure.
Materials and methods
Institutional review board (IRB) approval was obtained 
prior to the start of the study. Cohort formulation occurred 
via query of a prospective retrieval database of all failed im-
plants at a single institution between June 2007 and February 
2012. Query was isolated to all failed APCs (n = 41), and out 
of those APCs, isolated to Contour APCs (n = 24, Smith and

Introduction
In the setting of severe acetabular bone loss, reconstruction 
presents a unique and challenging scenario. Without a clear 
gold standard, several options are utilised to achieve cover-
age, stability, and functional outcome. For less severe defects, 
these options include the use of jumbo cups, oblong cups, and 
proximal cup placement, all with or without the support of 
 
allograft and/or metal augments (1-9). For massive defects and 
complete pelvic discontinuity, antiprotrusio cages (APCs) were 
developed with the hopes of providing a stable construct by 
filling the void and providing adequate coverage (10, 11).
ABSTRACT
Introduction: Acetabular reconstruction in the setting of severe bone loss or pelvic discontinuity remains a chal-
lenging problem. Multiple methods of treatment have been described including antiprotrusio cages (APCs). The 
objective of this study is to combine biomechanical analysis of retrieved APCs with radiographic and clinical data 
to determine which factors influence or predict APC failure.
Methods: 41 APCs were identified. Sequential radiographs were examined for cage and polyethylene cup abduc-
tion angles, change in centre of rotation, screw placement, progression of cage failure, and failure mechanism. 
Cages were manually examined for gross macroscopic findings, breakage, and the location of breakage. High-
resolution microscopy was used for further analysis.
Results: 24 cages were included in the analysis. Mean age of patients was 64.5 years (range 43-85 years); average 
length of implantation was 42.5 months (range 3-108 months). Average cage abduction angles were 56°; abduc-
tion for the cemented polyethylene cup was 44°. 14 of 24 cages were broken; 10 were intact. Of the broken cages, 
10/14 broke through a screw hole in the ischial flange or just superior to the ischial flange. In the intact group, 
6/10 failed due to pullout of the ischial screws.
Discussion: All cages had superior and lateralised centres of rotation. The majority of cages failed due to breakage 
or pullout at the ischial flange. Pelvic discontinuity was a large risk factor for a broken cage. Future design and 
technique modifications may result in superior outcomes in these complex acetabular reconstructions.

Nephew Inc.). A biomechanical engineer, specialising in or-
thopaedic implants, analysed all failed implants and recorded 
locations of deformation and/or fracture, any locations of 
notable wear or implant damage, along with the location of 
screw pullout and/or screw breakage.
Corresponding clinical and radiographic data were col-
lected for all included patients. Clinical data included age, 
gender, body mass index (BMI) and the time that the cages 
remained in situ. Recorded operative and implant data in-
cluded indications for implantation, reason for revision, 
length of implantation, and intraoperative findings. Sequen-
tial radiographs were examined for APC and polyethylene cup 
abduction angles, change in centre of rotation, screw place-
ment and breakage, along with progression of APC failure, 
and the mechanism of failure (Fig. 1). Radiographic classifi-
cation to identify complete pelvic discontinuity (AAOS Type 
IV/Paprosky 3B) was performed by a fellowship-trained adult 
reconstruction surgeon (17).
Results
A total of 24 failed Contour APCs were included for analy-
sis. Mean age of the cohort was 64.2 ± 3.7 years with the ma-
jority men (58%, 14/24) (Tab. I). Mean BMI was 24.2 ± 1.8 and 
the mean time in which the cages remained in-situ was 41.8 ± 
 
24.8 months (Tab. I). Mean abduction angle of the cage and 
cup at time of failure was 57.6 ± 9.8 degrees and 44.5° ± 8.9°, 
respectively (Tab. I). Mean displacement from the native hip 
centre as measured by Ranawat et al (18) was 10.7 ± 3.5 mm 
lateral and 4.9 ± 5.8 mm superior (Tab. I). No common pattern 
was seen on sequential radiograph examination.
14 of the 24 cages (58%) were broken and 10 were intact 
(Tab. II). The majority of the broken cages (87%) were indi-
cated for pelvic discontinuity, all of which also utilised struc-
tural allograft as supplement (AAOS IV/Paprosky 3B) (Tab. II). 
7 cages fractured through unfilled screw holes (50%). 4 cages 
(29%) contained fractured screws, all at the ischial flange. 
 
1 cage fractured through the shell towards the ischial side, an-
other cage fractured at the ilial flanges, and 1 cage exhibited

most often by ischial screw pull out (6/10) (Tab. II). The re-
maining cages failed via aseptic loosening. Fractured cages 
were revised to custom triflange cups, while cases with intact 
cages were revised to noncemented hemispherical cups.
Discussion
While retrieval analysis is routinely performed for failed 
primary total hip arthroplasty (THA), failed APC analysis has 
been a rarity in the literature (19-21). To our knowledge, 
this is the largest series of APCs to undergo retrieval analy-
sis in the literature. In regards to implant type, this is the 
only series to analyse failed Contour APCs. Therefore, it is 
difficult to compare areas and sequences of failure as there 
is a lack of literature regarding the Contour APC (16). Clini-
cally, comparisons to the Burch-Schneider APC was found 
to be similar in outcomes and complications, thus it seems 
reasonable to compare our series to the failures reported 
in the literature regarding the Burch-Schneider implant 
 
(11, 12, 14, 16).
With similar survivorship rates reported, comparisons of 
the types and locations of reported failures are consistent 
with the data we’ve reported on the Contour APC (11, 14, 19, 
22-24). Loosening, fracture and failure along the ischial com-
ponent continues to be a consistent trend. Regis et al (13) 
summarising their 10-year data for the Burch-Schneider APC, 
reported a survivorship of 72.2% at about 17 years follow-
up (13). Interestingly, there were no fractured portions of the 
cage. Furthermore, loosening when it did occur, occurred su-
periorly and not on the ischial flange. Finally, the screws that 
were also found broken, were along the ilial fixation, not at 
the ischial end. Closer analysis of their operative technique 
revealed that they did not utilise screw fixation at the ischial 
end, but instead opted to utilise the more technically de-
manding slotting method of fixation (13).
However, aside from this difference and further analysing 
their failures, along with the other reported failures in the 
literature, the data were consistent with our own reported 
data, if failure did occur either via pull-out, cage or screw 
fracture, it occurred on the ischial side. This occurred de-
spite ideal cage and cup position and all occurred outside of a 
mean in-situ interval of 24-36 months with minimal variation. 
Furthermore, cage and screw fracture had a high correlation 
with pelvic discontinuity. This is consistent with the  
reports 
in the literature, which also exhibit a similar correlation 
 
(10, 12, 13, 15, 22). Biomechanically, placing too much strain 
on the implant itself, bridging the ilium and the ischium 
causes excessive motion on a rigid construct, inducing failure.
Our study is not without its limitations. Unlike the large 
retrieval studies performed on primary THAs, we lack the 
sheer volume to perform meaningful statistical regression 
or correlation analyses to reliably provide objective correla-
tions and risk factors. With our numbers being so low, only 
trends and patterns can be observed. However, we feel that 
this data in itself, with implants analysed individually upon 
retrieval reveals important insights that can help in future 
designs. While we did not reveal any specific sequence of 
failure, this is likely because each patient represented a 
unique biomechanical scenario on each APC, leading to 
unique failure in each case. However, the trends noted did 
reveal important information, again noting that ischial fixa-
tion is a persistent problem that needs to be addressed in 
future designs.
In summary, our retrieval analysis of failed Contour APCs 
revealed data consistent with the failure data reported for 
the Burch-Schneider APC – notably, that ischial fixation re-
mains a problem. Furthermore, when treating pelvic dis-
continuity, one must understand and be cognisant of the 
excessive loads placed on the implant and unless the bony 
void is filled, the treating surgeon must carefully analyse the 
implant and screws for any signs of fracture failure. Future 
designs may utilise a less rigid metal to allow for more com-
pliant motion, while providing stable, fixation at the ischial 
and ilial ends.
