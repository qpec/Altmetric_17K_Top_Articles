abstract
Nicotine is the primary pharmacologic component of tobacco, and users 
of tobacco products seek out its effects. The highly addictive nature of 
nicotine is responsible for its widespread use and diffi
 culty with quitting. 
This technical report focuses on nicotine and discusses the stages of use in 
progression to dependence on nicotine-containing products; the physiologic 
characteristics, neurobiology, metabolism, pharmacogenetics, and 
health effects of nicotine; and acute nicotine toxicity. Finally, some newer 
approaches to cessation are noted.
INTRODUCTION
Tobacco exposure, whether through personal use, second- or thirdhand 
smoke exposure, or unintentional exposure, is the most important 
preventable cause of illness, disability, and death among adults in the 
United States. 
1 Worldwide, tobacco use is also the leading cause of 
preventable death. 
2 Many preventive measures have increased the 
perceived risk of smoking, which, along with the decreased access to 
cigarettes, has contributed to a gradual decline in use. However, the 
rate of decline has begun to slow for the use of cigarettes, and use 
has increased significantly for nicotine products such as hookahs and 
electronic nicotine delivery systems as well as for smokeless tobacco. As 
reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 
 
2 e-cigarette 
experimentation and recent use among US middle and high school 
students doubled from 2011 to 2012 and has increased significantly 
since then. It is now estimated that 1.78 million students have ever 
used e-cigarettes. Of these, 9% (an estimated 160 000 students) have 
never used conventional cigarettes. The Monitoring the Future Study 
has also found that more teenagers report using electronic nicotine 
delivery systems in the past 30 days than any other tobacco product. 
3 
Although these delivery systems may reduce exposure to some of the 
toxic chemicals in cigarettes, there are additional toxins associated with 
electronic nicotine delivery systems, and exposure to nicotine and its 
high addiction potential remain major concerns.4

It is well known that tobacco 
products contain more than 4000 
different chemicals. 
5 Their effects, 
along with the sensory stimulation 
and the conditioning that develops 
with continued use, may contribute 
to the addiction process, but nicotine 
is the major contributor to the 
development of dependence. It is the 
primary pharmacologic component 
of tobacco, and its effects are sought 
after by users. Its highly addictive 
nature is responsible for the 
widespread use and difficulty with 
quitting.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
Nicotine was originally isolated 
from the herbaceous plant Nicotiana 
tabacum, 
 a native of tropical and 
subtropical America but now 
commercially cultivated worldwide. 
The plant was named after the 
diplomat Jean Nicot de Villemain, 
who, in 1556, brought tobacco seeds 
and leaves as a “wonder drug” to the 
French court from Brazil. 
6 Nicotine 
is a potent parasympathomimetic 
alkaloid and is now known to occur 
in the nightshade family of plants 
(Solanaceae). It is also present 
in minimal quantities in tomato, 
potato, eggplant (aubergine), 
green pepper, and cocoa leaves. 
7 
Nicotine is produced in the roots 
and accumulates in the leaves of 
the tobacco plant, with the amount 
varying with position: that is, leaves 
harvested from higher stalk positions 
contain more nicotine than those 
from lower positions. Flue curing 
of the leaves changes the pH so that 
the smoke of the leaves is better 
inhaled and, as a result, both more 
addictive and more toxic. Leaves 
are usually combined so that, on 
average, cigarettes (in any of 15 
different cigarette brands) contain 
approximately 1.5% nicotine by 
weight. 
8 Burning tobacco releases the 
nicotine, which is carried proximally 
on tar droplets and in the vapor when 
inhaled. Other alkaloids constitute 
8% to 12% of the total alkaloid 
content of tobacco products.
CRITERIA FOR DEPENDENCE
Both the World Health Organization, 
in its International Classification 
of Diseases, 
 
9 and the American 
Psychiatric Association, in its 
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of 
Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, 
 
10 have 
issued diagnostic criteria to assess 
addiction. Currently, “substance use 
disorder” is the preferred term and 
includes dependence and withdrawal 
symptoms. Nicotine meets the 
established criteria for a drug that 
produces the symptoms of addiction, 
specifically, dependence, withdrawal, 
and craving.
First use of tobacco most often occurs 
in young adolescents, and the earlier 
one begins, the less likely one is to be 
able to stop using tobacco products 
11 
and the more likely use will continue 
with greater quantities. 
12 It has 
been estimated that two-thirds of 
children who smoke in sixth grade 
become regular adult smokers 
and almost half (46%) of smokers 
in the 11th grade become regular 
adult smokers. 
13 Even infrequent 
experimentation with smoking 
cigarettes can increase the risk of 
becoming a regular adult smoker; 
regular (defined as smoking at least 
monthly) smoking by an adolescent 
has been found to increase the risk of 
becoming an adult regular smoker by 
16 times compared with nonsmoking 
adolescents. 
13 Of tobacco-dependent 
adults, 90% started smoking before 
18 years of age and 99% started 
smoking before 26 years of age.14
A number of researchers have 
studied the development of nicotine 
addiction in adolescents. Even before 
any experimentation, adolescents’ 
exposure to advertising and the 
marketing of the range of tobacco 
products available can influence their 
attitudes about the risks and benefits 
of tobacco use. This initial preparatory 
stage is when individuals develop 
attitudes and beliefs about the utility 
of tobacco and may then begin to 
experiment with a few cigarettes. A 
few will never use again, and some 
will smoke repeatedly but irregularly.
Traditional theoretical models 
explaining nicotine addiction 
maintain that, beyond the role 
of nicotine as a key component 
required for the development of 
addiction, other behavioral, social, 
environmental, and psychological 
factors are also important for the 
development and maintenance 
of addiction. 
15 These include the 
attitude and behavior of friends 
and family members toward 
smoking, an underestimation of the 
addictive potential of nicotine, and 
an overestimation of the prevalence 
of peer smoking. Users also report 
that smoking alleviates anxiety, 
depression, and pain and that they, 
therefore, use it as a stress reliever. 
Although some of these effects may 
be related to the pharmacologic 
response along with the relief of 
withdrawal symptoms at times of 
smoking cessation, the belief that 
they are coping better with stress is a 
psychological effect that may lead to 
further use to control mood. Frequent 
dosing of nicotine is associated with 
hand-to-mouth movement that 
often becomes a social crutch that is 
difficult to do without after quitting. 
Other rituals associated with a 
particular device used may contribute 
to continued use. Smoking also 
becomes connected to specific times, 
experiences, and events, referred to 
as cues, and these become reinforcing 
of use over time. Light or intermittent 
smokers may be more influenced by 
these associated activities, such as 
after eating or drinking alcohol, than 
the need to use tobacco to relieve 
withdrawal symptoms. 
16
More recently, a newer model, the 
sensitization-homeostasis model, 
has been proposed as an alternative 
model, and a number of studies have 
supported this model to explain the 
development of nicotine addiction in

adolescents. 
17 This model suggests 
that, for adolescents, even infrequent 
smoking, such as at monthly 
intervals, is enough to put the 
individual at risk of dependence. 
18, 
 
19 
With nondaily smoking, even after 
the first cigarette, early symptoms 
of dependence, such as wanting to 
smoke or craving a cigarette, can 
develop if adolescents go too long 
without a cigarette. 
20 One study has 
shown that monthly smoking can 
increase the likelihood of developing 
dependence by 10-fold.21 These 
researchers also found that there is 
a reciprocal relationship between 
diminished autonomy about smoking 
and the frequency of smoking. They 
suggest that the urge to smoke occurs 
early on after initiation and that 
this, in turn, drives the teenager to 
increase the frequency of smoking, 
which increases the risk of further 
dependence symptoms, such as 
a need to smoke. With increased 
frequency, the adolescent is more 
likely to experience a more rapid 
progression to addiction and the 
need for daily smoking, such as one 
would see in a dose-response effect.
Researchers have also found that 
symptoms of dependence develop 
in a predictable sequence, beginning 
with wanting to smoke, followed 
by craving, and eventually needing 
to smoke to avoid withdrawal or 
abstinence symptoms, suggesting that 
the adolescent has neurophysiologic 
dependence. 
22 Neurophysiologic 
dependence may lead to tolerance, 
with a diminished effect experienced 
with continued use, resulting in 
an increased amount of nicotine 
needed to maintain equilibrium. This 
neuroadaptation within the brain may 
explain why teenagers report the need 
for nicotine to function normally.
PHYSIOLOGIC CHARACTERISTICS: 
FORMULATIONS, PREPARATIONS, AND 
ABSORPTION
Nicotine is a weak base, and its 
absorption across biological 
membranes is pH dependent. It does 
not rapidly cross membranes in an 
acidic environment when it is in 
an ionized form. The predominant 
form of tobacco in American 
cigarettes is flue cured. The initial 
puffs from these cigarettes have 
an acidic pH resulting in almost 
completely ionized nicotine that 
has little if any absorption across 
the buccal membranes. Air-cured 
tobacco, the predominant form in 
pipes, cigars, and a few European 
cigarettes, is alkaline. The released 
nicotine is largely nonionized and 
thus well absorbed through the 
mouth. Chewing tobacco, snuff, and 
nicotine polacrilex gum are also of 
alkaline pH, facilitating absorption 
through the oral mucous membranes. 
Nicotine can be absorbed through 
the skin, and toxicity has been 
documented in tobacco field-workers 
and those with skin contact with 
pesticides containing nicotine. In 
the lungs, the large surface area 
provided by the small airways 
and the alveoli as well as the local 
physiologic (slightly alkaline) pH of 
7.4 allow for the rapid absorption of 
nicotine from cigarette smoke, where 
it reaches the systemic circulation 
without first passing through the 
liver. It is estimated to reach the 
brain in as little as 7 seconds after 
inhalation. 
23 The rapid onset of 
action with inhaled nicotine leads 
to a greater “high” and reinforces 
use, which leads to neuroadaptation, 
and continued use is related not 
only to the need to obtain nicotine 
but also to conditioning. Nicotine is 
poorly absorbed from the stomach 
because of the acidic pH but well 
absorbed from the small intestine. 
Reabsorption from the intestine 
may be a potential source for 
enterohepatic circulation.
The dose of nicotine delivered 
cannot be determined solely by 
the nicotine content of the product 
because of these complexities. In 
addition, when smoking cigarettes, 
the actual amount of any alkaloid 
delivered depends on the puffing 
characteristics: that is, the depth of 
the puff and the frequency. Smokers 
typically take 10 puffs within the 
span of 5 minutes and absorb 1 to 
2 mg of nicotine (range: 0.5–3 mg). 
24 
The elimination half-life of nicotine is 
2 to 3 hours, meaning that the level 
of nicotine in the blood decreases 
by one-half after a smoker stops 
smoking for that length of time. This 
elimination half-life will decrease 
with repeated exposures to nicotine.
INCREASING PALATABILITY
Several additives are used in the 
manufacture of cigarettes to reduce 
the harshness of the smoke. 
25 
Menthol is an additive that is actively 
promoted by the tobacco industry 
for its perceived sensory benefits. 
A large number of young people 
and occasional users of cigarettes 
use menthol cigarettes because it 
helps reduce harshness. The specific 
candylike taste of menthol and its 
cooling, anesthetic, and analgesic 
properties make it appealing to these 
smokers. 
26 The sensory effects of 
menthol serve as conditioned stimuli, 
increasing the reinforcing effects 
of nicotine and thus the addiction 
potential of menthol cigarettes. As 
users become tolerant of this flavor, 
some actively seek even stronger 
sensory attributes in a cigarette, 
and beginning with a menthol-
containing product may facilitate 
an adolescent’s progression to daily 
smoking. Smokers who prefer and 
choose menthol-containing products 
tend to be disproportionately black 
and male. 
25 The perceived reduction 
in harshness may result in the intake 
of more cigarettes, and therefore 
more toxic and dependence-causing 
substances, increasing the difficulty 
in quitting cigarette use. 
27 The 
perceived reduced harshness also 
contributes to the perception that 
cigarettes are less harmful than they 
actually are.
Similarly, other products have 
additives that increase their

palatability. The tobacco used in 
hookahs (shisha, maassel, tumbak, 
or jurak) is moist and shredded. It 
is mixed with sweeteners such as 
honey, molasses, or fruit, and many 
have candy or fruit flavoring added. 
Bidis, hand-rolled, thin, filterless 
cigarettes, are sold unflavored or 
flavored (eg, with vanilla, strawberry, 
or mango). Kreteks, clove-flavored 
cigarettes, have a particularly 
pungent smell. Kreteks, used in 
Indonesia, contain eugenol, which 
has an anesthetic effect, allowing for 
deeper inhalation. Chewing tobacco 
is used all over the world; and in 
1 form used in India, referred to 
as pan masala, areca nuts, slaked 
lime, and other flavoring agents and 
sweeteners are added. Electronic 
nicotine delivery systems also have 
>7760 unique flavors, including fruit, 
candy, and dessert flavors, raising 
concerns about the strong appeal of 
all these products to children. 
28
MECHANISM OF ACTION: 
NEUROBIOLOGY
Nicotine acts on nicotinic 
acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) 
in the peripheral nervous system 
(autonomic ganglia and adrenal 
medulla; neuromuscular junction) 
and the central nervous system 
(CNS). The nAChRs are ligand-gated 
ion channels made up of 5 subunits 
that assemble around an ion pore. 
When nicotine or acetylcholine binds, 
a change occurs in their conformation 
that renders the ion pore permeable 
to cations, which, in turn, excite 
the cell. There are 12 isoforms, 9 
α-subunits labeled from α2 to α10 
and 3 β-subunits labeled from β2 
to β4. The mix of these subunits in 
each receptor gives the receptor its 
distinct pharmacologic properties 
and its response to nicotine 
stimulation. The activation of some 
receptors promotes the reinforcing 
effects, whereas the activation of 
others limits reinforcement and 
possibly mediates the aversive 
effects. An understanding of these 
subunits is helping researchers 
develop antismoking medications. 
In the human brain, the most widely 
expressed nAChR is the α4, 
β2 
subunit, which has a central function 
in the mediation of the physiologic 
effects of nicotine. With repeated 
exposure, there is an increase in the 
number of nAChRs. This upregulation 
is believed to be the response to 
nicotine-mediated desensitization 
of the receptors and may play a role 
in the development of dependence. 
Overnight, when these receptors 
become unoccupied, it has been 
suggested that they recover to a 
responsive state, which creates the 
craving and withdrawal symptoms 
experienced by many in the morning.
Functional imaging studies of the 
brain have detected differences in 
brain structure between smokers 
and nonsmokers. Smokers have 
been found to have differences in 
the microstructural order in white 
matter areas of the brain, specifically 
the anterior cingulate bundle. 
29 
Studies also have found that smokers 
reporting more subjective symptoms 
of dependence, by using standardized 
measures, had a decreased density of 
neural connections, or streamlines, 
between the anterior cingulate 
bundle and the precuneus and 
increased connections between the 
anterior cingulate bundle and the 
superior-frontal cortex. These areas 
of the brain and specific circuits 
are those correlated with memory, 
motivation, executive function, 
and mood. These studies support 
the connection between subjective 
symptoms of nicotine dependence 
and white matter structure and 
suggest that nicotine dependence 
over time can result in neuroplastic 
changes in a number of brain 
systems.
In addition, various 
neurotransmitters are involved, 
including acetylcholine, dopamine, 
noradrenaline, serotonin, glutamate, 
opioids, and γ-aminobutyric acid; 
and the overall physiologic effect 
of nicotine may result from the 
interactions of these various 
neurotransmitters. Nicotine 
receptors in the CNS are located 
mainly in presynaptic membrane, 
and in that way, they regulate the 
release of several neurotransmitters. 
Nicotine increases concentrations 
of dopamine, a neurotransmitter 
essential for boosting attention, 
reward-seeking behaviors, and the 
risk of various addictions, from 
gambling to drug use. 
30 Dopamine 
is released in the mesolimbic 
system, the corpus striatum, and 
frontal cortex and is critical for 
the drug-induced reward effect. 
Nicotine receptors in the striatum, 
where movements are planned and 
controlled, are located near the 
terminals that regulate and emit 
dopamine. In animal studies, even 
a small dose of nicotine stimulates 
the release of dopamine in the 
striatum, stopping movements that 
otherwise would go uncontrolled. 
This finding has led to research 
examining the role of nicotine in the 
prevention and treatment of a variety 
of neurologic disorders, including 
Parkinson disease, mild cognitive 
impairment, Tourette syndrome, 
schizophrenia, and attention-deficit/
hyperactivity disorder. The available 
research suggests that youth with 
mental illness are at increased risk 
of tobacco use. 
31 The direction of 
causation remains unclear.
Epidemiologic studies have 
contributed to the development of 
the gateway drug model that suggest 
that previous use of the legal drugs 
tobacco and alcohol increases the 
vulnerability to the subsequent use 
of illicit drugs. Studies indicate that 
ethanol potentiates the response 
of high-affinity nAChRs to both 
acetylcholine and nicotine. 
32 Even 
small amounts of alcohol are 
known to boost nicotine effects, 
inducing subjects to smoke more. 
A recent study in a mouse model 
examining the effects of nicotine 
on cocaine abuse has provided a

biological mechanism to support 
the gateway theory by showing that 
nicotine increases the expression 
of the FosB gene (which has been 
related to addiction) and increases 
the vulnerability to cocaine 
dependence. 
33 This finding suggests 
that the prevention and cessation of 
nicotine use may decrease the future 
risk of addiction to illicit drugs.
NICOTINE METABOLISM
Nicotine is mainly metabolized 
by the liver (85%–90%), and the 
metabolites are then excreted 
through the kidneys. Only 10% of 
nicotine is excreted unchanged. 
Nicotine metabolism involves a 
2-step process mediated by the 
cytochrome P450 system, mainly by 
the hepatic enzymes CYP2A6 and 
CYP2B6. The first step produces 
the metabolite cotinine, which 
is then converted to multiple 
products, the most abundant being 
3′-hydroxycotinine. The ratio of 
3′-hydroxycotinine to cotinine 
is a reflection of in vivo nicotine 
clearance and is referred to as the 
nicotine metabolic rate. Some data 
from patients with chronic kidney 
disease indicate that the excretion of 
cotinine is minimally affected. 
34
Cotinine has a long half-life (18–20 
hours), and on average, it takes 
approximately 72 hours to eliminate 
90% of the cotinine. 
35 Although 
this long half-life makes it difficult 
to assess the most recent cigarette 
intake/smoking pattern, cotinine’s 
concentration in the urine correlates 
well with blood concentration. The 
measurement of urinary cotinine 
concentration is a useful method 
to distinguish smokers from 
nonsmokers and is a marker for 
long-term nicotine intake, although 
an increased urinary cotinine 
concentration can be observed in 
people exposed to secondhand smoke 
(SHS). Because employer-based 
insurance is now affected by the use 
of tobacco, an understanding of the 
utility of nicotine and cotinine testing 
is important for employers. Although 
not commonly tested for, cotinine 
can also be used for screening 
adolescents who use these products 
or those who are exposed to SHS. 
Cotinine can be measured in serum, 
urine, saliva, and hair. Nonsmokers 
exposed to typical levels of SHS have 
serum cotinine concentrations less 
than 1 ng/mL. People with heavy 
exposure to SHS have serum cotinine 
concentrations in the range of 1 to 
10 ng/mL, whereas active smokers 
almost always have serum cotinine 
concentrations higher than 
10 ng/mL and occasionally higher 
than 500 ng/mL. 
36
PHARMACOGENETICS OF NICOTINE
The variation in nicotine response 
can be understood to be the result 
of the interaction between drug 
metabolism and drug receptor 
genotypes. 
37 This variation in 
response is still an area of active 
investigation, and new data are 
adding to our understanding.
Drug Metabolism
Genetic variation in the CYP2A6 
gene can increase or decrease 
this enzyme’s activity through 
altering the protein’s expression 
level or its structure and function 
and thus nicotine metabolism. 
Multiple alleles of the CYP2A6 
enzyme have been identified 
(www. 
cypalleles. 
ki. 
se/ 
cyp2a6. 
htm), including single nucleotide 
polymorphisms, duplications, 
deletions, and conversions, which 
have allowed for grouping people 
into slow, intermediate, and 
normal metabolizers. 
38 People 
who carry reduced or null activity 
CYP2A6 alleles are more likely to 
be nonsmokers or smoke fewer 
cigarettes per day, are less likely to 
progress to nicotine dependence, 
and may have an easier time quitting 
smoking and have a lower risk of 
lung cancer. 
39 The opposite is the 
case for fast metabolizers.
Drug Receptor Genotypes
Each of the nAChRs is encoded 
for by a single CHRN gene. Large 
genomewide association study 
meta-analyses have brought to light 
the variations in the nAChR subunit 
genes that make the strongest 
genetic contribution to smoking-
related habits. 
40 The gene locus 
on chromosome 15q25.1 contains 
a dense set of highly correlated 
single nucleotide polymorphisms, 
in the CHRNA5-CHRNA3-CHRNB4 
gene cluster. 
41 These may influence 
the age of initiation, the amount 
smoked, the development of nicotine 
dependence, and adverse effects 
such as lung cancer and chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease. 
These associations appear to be more 
important in early-onset smokers, 
suggesting an age-associated 
relationship. In addition to smoking 
quantity and nicotine dependence, 
variants in nAChR genes have also 
been associated with alcohol and 
other substance dependencies as 
well as with a predisposition to 
schizophrenia. 
41, 
 
42
NICOTINE METABOLISM AND RACE, 
SEX, AND AGE
The rate of nicotine metabolism 
has been found to vary by sex 
and race, which may influence 
susceptibility to addiction and ability 
to quit. Differences in the CYP2A6 
allele frequencies may underlie 
this variability across sexes and 
ethnic groups. Up to 90% of white 
smokers are fast metabolizers. Latino 
smokers have rates of metabolism 
similar to white smokers. African-
American smokers are more likely 
to be slow metabolizers, and Asian 
smokers have the slowest nicotine 
metabolic rates. 
36 On average, 
slow metabolizers smoke fewer 
cigarettes than fast metabolizers 
and have higher quit rates, and 
the slower nicotine metabolism 
may account for their lower risk 
of nicotine addiction in studies 
in African-American smokers.

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
Women metabolize nicotine faster 
than men, which may explain why 
women have more difficulty in 
quitting. 
44 It is important to use 
caution in the clinical application 
of these data to individual patients 
because of heterogeneity and thus 
limitations of how racial categories 
are defined in the literature and the 
unique diversity of use and addiction 
trajectories of each patient. It is 
anticipated that further research will 
make individual-level assessments 
available in the future. Another factor 
affecting nicotine metabolism is 
the use of hormonal contraception. 
Studies indicate that these 
medications may accelerate cotinine 
metabolism in women, probably by 
an estrogen induction of CYP2A6 
that is independent of ethnicity and 
cigarette consumption. 
45
In the adolescent years, recent 
studies have confirmed differences 
in metabolic rate by race but not 
by sex. 
46 However, the use of oral 
contraceptive pills, as in women, has 
been found to accelerate nicotine 
metabolism in adolescent tobacco-
dependent smokers. 
47 Another study 
by the same authors assessed the rate 
of nicotine metabolism in adolescents 
by using the nicotine metabolic rate 
as a reflection of the rate of clearance 
of nicotine. Slow metabolizers, 
because they have nicotine present 
for a longer time, are expected to 
smoke less. However, the findings 
were the opposite among slower 
metabolizers. They smoked more 
cigarettes per day and had higher 
addiction scores. These authors 
hypothesized that the brains of these 
slower metabolizers are exposed 
to greater amounts of nicotine for a 
longer period of time, and therefore, 
slower metabolizers may be more 
likely to develop addiction in early 
stages of smoking. 
48
HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF EXPOSURE 
TO NICOTINE
Although there are adverse health 
effects attributable to nicotine, most 
of the adverse health consequences 
of tobacco use are the result of 
damage caused by tar, carbon 
monoxide, oxidizing chemicals, and 
other constituents in the product 
rather than nicotine. 
14 Although 
smoking affects almost every system 
in the body, only some effects have 
been found to be directly related to 
nicotine use.
The data are insufficient to conclude 
that nicotine causes cancer, but 
there is evidence that it may increase 
the risk of oral, esophageal, and 
pancreatic cancer. In women, the 
intensity of current smoking has 
been noted to be an independent 
risk factor for high-grade cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia, after 
controlling for cervical human 
papillomavirus infection. 
49
As noted previously, nicotine 
stimulates the release of various 
neurotransmitters in the CNS. 
Nicotine users endorse a reduction 
in pain, anxiety, and other negative 
emotional symptoms along with 
positive feelings of a mild euphoria, 
alertness, increased memory, and 
learning. Nicotine also has many 
neuroendocrine responses. 
50 
Although smokers say they smoke 
to control stress, studies show 
a significant increase in cortisol 
concentrations in daily smokers 
compared with occasional smokers 
or nonsmokers. 
51 These findings 
suggest that, despite the subjective 
effects, smoking may actually worsen 
the negative emotional states. The 
effects of nicotine on the sleep-wake 
cycle through nicotine receptors 
may have a functional significance. 
Nicotine receptor stimulation 
promotes wake time and reduces 
both total sleep time and rapid 
eye movement sleep. Dopamine 
release in the CNS inhibits prolactin 
secretion from the anterior pituitary. 
However, decreased concentrations 
are only seen with long-term use, 
possibly because of desensitization 
of the nAChRs. Acute nicotine use 
increases prolactin secretion.
The cardiovascular effects of 
nicotine are mainly the result of 
stimulation of the sympathetic 
nervous system. In humans, nicotine 
has a biphasic physiologic response. 
In low concentrations, it acts as a 
stimulant by increasing adrenal 
catecholamines, but high doses of 
nicotine have the opposite effect, 
with hypotension and slowing of the 
heart rate. 
52 nAChRs are found not 
only in neuronal and muscle cells but 
also in endothelial and immune cells. 
Nicotine induces proliferation of 
vascular smooth muscle cells and the 
migration of cells into blood vessels. 
Nicotine also increases lipolysis, 
resulting in the release of free fatty 
acids; over time, these effects cause 
an acceleration of coronary and 
peripheral vascular disease as well as 
an increase in the risk of strokes.
A relationship has been found 
between nicotine and inflammatory 
bowel disease. Although smoking 
has a deleterious effect on those 
with Crohn disease, it protects those 
with ulcerative colitis. 
53, 
 
54 The risk 
of developing ulcerative colitis is 
lower in smokers (odds ratio: 0.41; 
95% confidence interval:, 0.34–0.48). 
People who stop smoking and then 
resume smoking experience clinical 
improvement. 
54 Many possible 
explanations have been proposed; 
these include the effects of smoking 
on cellular and humoral immunity, 
cytokines, eicosanoid-mediated 
inflammation, antioxidant and 
oxygen free radicals, endogenous 
glucocorticoids, colonic mucus, 
mucosal blood flow, thrombosis, gut 
permeability, and motility. 
55 Recent 
research on microbiota changes with 
smoking may also help explain the 
influence of smoking on inflammatory 
bowel disease. Additional research on 
whether other chemicals in cigarettes 
may also be involved in this process 
is underway. However, no advantages 
over standard therapy have been 
advanced, and adverse effects of 
nicotine preclude a therapeutic 
recommendation.

Recent studies indicate that the 
parasympathetic nervous system 
controls innate immune responses 
through the modulation of the 
production of multiple inflammatory 
cytokines. Acetylcholine, as the 
principal neurotransmitter for 
the parasympathetic nervous 
system, has been shown to have 
antiinflammatory effects mediated 
through the nicotinic receptors 
on macrophages, inhibiting the 
proinflammatory cytokines from 
these macrophages. 
56 The finding of 
distinct nAChR subtypes expressed 
on immune cells now suggests that 
this regulation is based on receptor 
affinity; evidence has been found 
for a crucial role for an α7 nAChR 
subtype in this process.
Clinical and experimental evidence 
indicates that nicotine is at 
least partly responsible for the 
progression of chronic kidney disease 
in cigarette smokers. 
57 Nicotine also 
exacerbates acute kidney injury by 
various mechanisms. 
58
The bone marrow is innervated 
by cholinergic nerve fibers and 
macrophages, and other cytokine-
producing cells express the α7 
receptor and are functionally 
responsive to nicotine, which 
indicates a probable mechanism for 
control of inflammation. Similarly, 
microglial cells represent the largest 
class of phagocytes in the CNS and 
are regulated by acetylcholine. The 
activation of these microglia can be 
neurotoxic or neuroprotective and 
thus are important in CNS pathology. 
Several nicotinic agonists specifically 
targeting the α7 nAChR have been 
developed and are being studied 
for the treatment of neurologic, 
inflammatory, and infectious 
diseases. Long-term exposure 
to nicotine increases the risk of 
osteoporosis and bone fractures 
by creating an imbalance in bone 
remodeling through nicotine’s effects 
on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. 
59
Nicotine also has an effect on body 
weight through mechanisms that 
are complex and not completely 
understood. The acute response 
is suppression of appetite and an 
increase in the metabolic rate, but 
chronic administration activates 
systems that increase appetite and 
decrease metabolic rate. 
60 Many 
chronic smokers are overweight 
and have the metabolic syndrome 
with increased visceral adiposity. 
However, the reduction in appetite 
and the weight control are important 
effects that are more likely to appeal 
to younger females than males. 
61 
The increased appetite and weight 
gain that occur after stopping 
smoking can serve as a deterrent 
to smoking cessation for women. 
62 
Women who stop are also at greater 
risk of relapse to avoid the weight 
gain. Adequate pharmacotherapy of 
tobacco dependence may decrease or 
eliminate the weight gain associated 
with stopping. One study found that 
soon after abstinence from tobacco 
smoking, an increase in the plasma 
concentration of the appetite-
stimulating peptide acetylated 
ghrelin occurs. 
63 This finding could 
explain the increased food craving 
during nicotine withdrawal and 
subsequent weight gain.
Nicotine has a negative dose-related 
impact on both male and female 
fertility. In men, nicotine affects both 
gametogenesis and steroidogenesis. 
Nicotine also impairs nitric oxide 
synthesis, leading to erectile 
dysfunction. Although cigarette 
smoking has been associated with 
decreased fertility rates, adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, and higher 
risk of in vitro fertilization failure, 
the precise role of nicotine is still 
being evaluated both for the woman 
and for the fetus. The short-term 
safety of nicotine replacement 
therapy during pregnancy has been 
evaluated in a limited number of 
studies, but long-term effects on 
the fetus warrant further studies. 
Animal studies suggest that there 
may be an increased incidence 
of obesity, hypertension, type 2 
diabetes, respiratory dysfunction, 
neurobehavioral effects, and 
impaired fertility. 
64
Two key studies have documented 
the developmental effects on 
offspring of women who smoked 
cigarettes prenatally and support 
concerns that tobacco or nicotine 
can have significant effects on early 
neurodevelopment in humans. 
65, 
 
66 
These studies have found that infants 
born to mothers who smoked during 
their pregnancies had reduced weight, 
length, and head circumference but 
also showed significant impairments 
in cognitive functioning, impulsivity, 
hyperactivity, and increased risk of 
developing an addiction disorder. 
These effects were seen throughout 
early childhood and persisted 
through adolescence and into young 
adulthood.
The neurobiological systems that are 
related to these behavioral problems 
are found in the dopamine, opioid 
neuropeptide, and cannabinoid 
systems in the amygdala and striatal 
regions of the brain and are important 
for the regulation of processes 
relevant to the behaviors noted 
previously. 
67 Numerous studies that 
used animal models have identified 
the effects of both cigarette smoke or 
nicotine on brain development during 
fetal development, such as altered 
expression of nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors in critical brainstem areas 
involved in autonomic function and 
altered excitability of neurons in 
brainstem areas involved in sensory 
integration. 
68, 
 
69 Functional correlates 
of nicotine exposure include 
hypoventilation and apnea, as well as 
blunted chemoreflexes in response to 
hypoxia. 
70– 
72
Studies in human fetal subjects who 
have been exposed to nicotine have 
provided a better understanding 
of the molecular mechanisms 
underlying the developmental 
behaviors seen with prenatal nicotine 
exposure. For example, researchers 
have found that prenatal cigarette 
e7

 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
exposure is associated with a 
decrease in the expression of the 
genes related to the endogenous 
opioid system in areas of the 
brain, the nucleus accumbens, that 
have been implicated in behavior 
motivation and mood regulation. 
73 
Prenatal tobacco exposure also 
alters both nicotinic and muscarinic 
receptors of the cholinergic systems 
in the brainstem and cerebellar 
regions. 
67 Nicotinic acetylcholine 
receptors are strongly associated 
with serotonergic (5-HT receptors) 
in the brainstem during fetal 
development, and abnormalities of 
serotonergic neurotransmission in 
the brainstem have been consistent 
with neuropathologic findings in 
cases of sudden unexpected and 
unexplained death in infancy. 
74, 
 
75 
In first-trimester human fetuses, 
abnormal nicotinic receptor subunit 
levels have also been detected in the 
brainstem regions associated with 
sudden infant death syndrome.76 
Dysfunction of these brainstem 
regions, which can be associated 
with sudden infant death syndrome, 
is strongly associated with maternal 
cigarette use during pregnancy, 
and the alterations that are seen 
with gene expression in these 
cholinergic receptor subunits may 
be a contributing factor to the 
brainstem abnormalities seen in 
these infants. 
77 These molecular 
alterations in gene expression as a 
result of prenatal nicotine exposure 
may be explained by epigenetic 
mechanisms, which is currently an 
area of active research. 
67 The reader 
is referred to the American Academy 
of Pediatrics’ technical report “SIDS 
and Other Sleep-Related Infant 
Deaths: Evidence Base for 2016 
Updated Recommendations for a 
Safe Infant Sleeping Environment” 
for a comprehensive review on this 
subject. 
78
ACUTE TOXICITY
Children can ingest nicotine from 
the tobacco in cigarettes, chewing 
tobacco, pipe tobacco, nicotine gum 
and patches, and some insecticides. 
Most such incidents occur in children 
younger than 6 years, and the 
frequency and severity of outcomes 
are generally benign because of the 
ensuing emesis. 
79, 
 
80 Recently, the 
newer electronic nicotine delivery 
systems with refillable cartridges that 
contain liquid nicotine have become 
a source of accidental exposure to 
a concentrated nicotine solution. 
The Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention has reported a marked 
increase in e-cigarette liquid-related 
calls to poison control centers, from 1 
per month (September 2010) to 215 
per month (February 2014). More 
than half (51.1%) of calls involved 
children younger than 5 years. 
81 
A death of a child who ingested the 
concentrated nicotine solution used 
with electronic nicotine delivery 
systems was reported recently. 
82
Early symptoms of nicotine ingestion 
include a burning sensation in the 
mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, 
confusion, dizziness, weakness, and 
drooling from increased salivation. 
Signs include tachycardia, tachypnea, 
hypertension, and agitation followed 
by bradycardia, hypotension, and 
respiratory depression. Severe 
poisoning leads to arrhythmias, 
coma, convulsions, and cardiac arrest. 
Skin or eye contact with concentrated 
liquid may cause irritation followed 
by variable absorption. Systemic 
signs or symptoms may follow. The 
lethal dose of nicotine has been 
estimated to be as little as 50 to 
60 mg in adults, although this 
number is disputed. The lethal 
dose in children is probably much 
lower, between 1 and 13 mg/kg, and 
severe toxic reactions have been 
reported in children with doses as 
low as 2 mg. Nicotine liquid refills 
are available in various strengths 
ranging from 6 (0.6%) to 36 (3.6%) 
mg/mL. Assuming there are 20 drops 
in 1 mL of solution, 1 drop of 3.6% 
nicotine liquid will contain 1.8 mg 
nicotine. The dose of nicotine that 
has been estimated to be lethal for 
50% of adults is between 0.8 and 
13.0 mg/kg. 
83 It has been estimated 
that 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of a 1.8% 
nicotine solution could be lethal to 
a 90-kg person. 
84 The ingestion of a 
few drops of concentrated solution 
is enough to cause severe symptoms 
in young children. 
85 For example, 
the ingestion of 1 to 2 drops of a 
3.6% solution (1.8–3.6 mg) will put 
most children younger than 5 years 
in this category. With the use of a 
midrange of this lethal dose (6 mg/
kg), the ingestion of 0.5 teaspoon 
(or 2 mL) of a concentrated nicotine 
solution could even be lethal to an 
average 12-kg, 20-month-old child. 
4 
Thus, children who have ingested 
≥0.2 mg/kg of nicotine would be 
expected to be symptomatic and 
will need medical assessment. The 
refill liquids also contain unknown 
concentrations of oil of wintergreen 
(methyl salicylate), glycerin, and 
propylene glycol, which could 
also cause multiple toxidromes, 
including salicylism and cholinergic 
crisis.86 The risk posed by nicotine 
liquid to children is an important 
anticipatory guidance topic to 
discuss with parents and caregivers. 
Preventive measures to reduce toxic 
ingestions include public education 
and legislation to improve the safety 
profile of electronic nicotine delivery 
system containers through limited 
volumes in available containers and 
child-proof packaging.
CESSATION
Although nearly half of adult 
smokers attempt to stop each 
year, <5% succeed because of 
nicotine’s highly addictive nature. 
14 
Youth also attempt to quit, and 
those with greater evidence of 
dependence are more likely to 
have difficulty stopping. They make 
more quit attempts before being 
successful compared with adults. 
Approximately 4% of adolescent

 PEDIATRICS Volume  
139 
, number

smokers 12 to 19 years of age 
successfully quit smoking each 
year. 
87 Starting smoking at a younger 
age is associated with more severe 
addiction and decreased rates of 
stopping smoking. 
88
Tobacco-dependence 
pharmacotherapy has been clearly 
shown to be safe and effective for 
adults and improves cessation rates. 
Current US Public Health Service 
guidelines recommend that all 
adults who smoke should be offered 
pharmacotherapy for tobacco-
dependence treatment. 
89 The current 
US Food and Drug Administration–
approved tobacco-dependence 
treatment medications include the 
shorter-acting nicotine polacrilex 
gum (over the counter [OTC]), 
nicotine lozenge (OTC), nicotine nasal 
spray (by prescription), and nicotine 
oral inhaler (by prescription). 
These shorter-acting medications 
can be considered as “relievers, 
” 
although their onset of action is 
much longer than that of cigarettes. 
Long-acting medications include 
the nicotine patch (OTC), bupropion 
(by prescription), and varenicline 
(by prescription). These can be 
considered as controller medications. 
Current approaches to tobacco-
dependence pharmacotherapy 
initiate medications on the basis of 
severity of addiction and, on follow–
up, adjusts medications depending on 
control of nicotine withdrawal. 
90
As discussed in the 2015 policy 
statement from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics, “Clinical 
Practice Policy to Protect Children 
From Tobacco, Nicotine, and Tobacco 
Smoke, 
” 
91 pharmacotherapy can 
be considered to help moderately 
to severely tobacco-dependent 
adolescents who want to stop, 
despite challenges with adherence 
and the resulting high relapse rates. 
A possible concern for nicotine-
replacement therapy use during 
adolescence, when smoking often 
begins, is that nicotine can change 
the neurodevelopmental trajectory. 
Further research is needed to 
evaluate the use of these medications 
in youth at various stages of use to 
better define the risks, benefits, and 
optimal treatment strategies and to 
inform optimal patient selection for 
the various pharmacotherapies.
E-cigarettes have been aggressively 
promoted as smoking cessation aids, 
but research studies have not been 
able to document their effectiveness 
in adults. Recent research suggests 
that the use of e-cigarettes may 
encourage, rather than discourage, 
the use of conventional cigarettes 
among US adolescents. 
92, 
 
93
A new approach to aid in 
tobacco cessation is the use of an 
antiaddiction vaccine that will 
induce antibodies that block the 
pharmacologic effects of nicotine. 
94 
Nicotine is nonimmunogenic and 
must be conjugated as a hapten to 
a protein carrier. The premise is 
that the antibody will attach to the 
nicotine molecule and prevent it from 
diffusing through the capillaries. It is 
then less likely to enter the brain and 
bind to the nAChRs. Although this 
approach has shown considerable 
promise in animal models, the 
research on its efficacy in humans 
thus far is limited. The serum 
nicotine-specific antibody titers 
induced by the vaccine vary greatly. 
95 
This variability means that a 
substantial number of nonresponders 
have low antibody titers that are not 
likely to be effective. Currently, the 
evidence does not show success with 
long-term smoking cessation with 
currently available vaccines. 
96 Newer 
vaccines are now being designed 
to enhance the mean antibody 
titer and to reduce the number 
of nonresponders. There are no 
vaccines currently licensed for use in 
any country.
As noted previously, whereas 
nicotine is the key component of 
tobacco products required for the 
development and maintenance 
of addiction, behavioral, social, 
environmental, and psychological 
factors also contribute to this 
process. Most of the research on 
tobacco-dependence treatment 
of adolescents has focused on 
behaviorally based interventions. 
These interventions are most 
effective for those with mild 
degrees of nicotine dependence 
and least effective (although 
still of some benefit) for those 
with severe dependence. 
97 Data 
are limited to support any 1 
clinical approach to adolescent 
cessation of nicotine use. Effective 
behaviorally based strategies have 
focused on problem-solving skills 
and on providing support and 
encouragement. 
89 The US Public 
Health Service recommends the 
following counseling modalities 
98: 
cognitive-behavioral strategies 
(self-monitoring and coping skills), 
motivational strategies (techniques 
to clarify desire for change and 
reduce ambivalence toward change), 
and social influence strategies 
(addressing social influences that 
serve to promote or maintain 
smoking). Dependence treatment 
is not the focus of this technical 
report, and the reader is referred 
to the previously mentioned 2015 
policy statement from the American 
Academy of Pediatrics. 
91
CONCLUSIONS
Nicotine is the chemical in tobacco 
products that has a major role in the 
development of dependence. The 
rapidly developing brains of children 
and adolescents are particularly 
susceptible to nicotine addiction. 
Given the difficulty adolescents have 
with stopping tobacco use, the need 
for the prevention of tobacco use 
initiation is high.
