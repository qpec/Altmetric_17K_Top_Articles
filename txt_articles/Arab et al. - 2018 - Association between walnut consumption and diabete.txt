Abstract
Background:
Dietary interventions and cohort studies relating tree nut consump-
tion to blood glucose levels suggest a possible effect of walnuts.
Objective:
To examine the associations between walnut consumption and diabetes
risk using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
Methods:
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data on adults
conducting 24‐hour dietary recall was pooled across the years 1999 through 2014.
Diabetes status or risk was based on self‐report, medication use, fasting plasma
glucose levels, and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Individuals were characterized
based on reported consumption of walnuts, mixed‐nuts, or no nuts.
Results:
After adjustment for covariates, walnut consumers showed lower risk for
diabetes compared with non‐nut consumers based on self‐report (odds ratio of
0.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.31‐0.72) as well as fasting blood glucose (relative
risk ratio 0.32, CI 0.17‐0.58) and HbA1c (relative risk ratio 0.51, CI 0.27‐0.99). For
each standard deviation of increase in walnut intake, prevalence of diabetes dropped
47%. The gender by walnut interaction suggests that the effect may be more potent
among women than men (dose response P = .061).
Conclusions:
Both among individuals with known diabetes and those diagnosed
based on elevated diabetes blood markers, the prevalence of individuals with diabetes
was significantly lower among the walnut consumers. A possible gender‐specific
effect invites further attention.

BACKGROUND
Walnuts have received much attention for their effects on cardiovas-
cular health. Eight clinical trial studies have specifically tested whether
the addition of walnuts to the diet under experimental conditions
impacts biomarkers of diabetes risk or fasting insulin levels among

 populations with type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome, polycystic
ovarian syndrome, or among healthy subjects.1-8 In these experiments,
between 30 and 108 g of walnuts were given per day to a total of 162
females and 132 males for a duration of 4 days to 12 months. Signif-
icant decreases were seen in levels of haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)
(P < .0006) and insulin response time (P = .018) among patients with
polycystic ovarian syndrome at a given 36 g of walnuts per day.2
Fasting insulin dropped significantly among patients with type 2 dia-
betes supplemented with 30 g of walnuts per day for 12 months
(P = .046).6 This lends support to the hypothesis that the addition of
walnuts at a dose of 30 g/day or more may be beneficial in the pre-
vention and control of type 2 diabetes in efficacy trials.2,6 Further sup-
port comes from the use of walnut hydrosol extract to control blood
sugar of persons with diabetes mellitus. Physicians found a significant
decrease in both average daily blood sugar (ranging from 12 to 31 mg/
dL) and the required insulin dose (4‐8 units).9
Recently meta analyses have been published on the overall effects
of different food classes on both heart disease and type 2 diabetes10,11
These studies have found protective effects of nuts/seeds, warranting
further research into nuts, and subsequently specific nut studies. Stud-
ies of free‐living populations have generally grouped all nuts (including
peanuts, a known legume) in their study of associations of nut consump-
tion with diabetes.12-15 The only epidemiologic study to date that spe-
cifically investigated how walnut consumption influenced risk of
diabetes found an inverse relationship when controlling for body mass
index.14 To further explore the association between walnut consump-
tion and risk of type 2 diabetes, we used data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) (1999‐2014), which rep-
resents the US population. We identified diabetic individuals through
self report, laboratory glucose, and HbA1c levels commonly used to
identify pre‐diabetes or diabetes. These data were used to discern the
relationship between walnut consumption as compared with other nuts
(ON) and non‐nut consumption and diabetes risk, in the US population.

Participants
2.1.1
|
NHANES sample
The NHANES is a cross‐sectional, probability survey administered to
the US civilian population aged from 0 to 85 years. This study used
continuous NHANES data collected from 1999 to 2014, covering 8
cycles of data collection (N = 82 091). Participants were excluded from
analysis for being under 18 (N = 34 735) and not having data on either
day of the 24‐hour food intake (N = 6533). In an attempt to have a
control group free of nut consumers, individuals who consumed pea-
nuts, but not ON on the day of recall, were excluded from the analysis
(N = 6702). After exclusions, our analytic sample N was 34 121,
representing a population size of approximately 176 million individ-
uals. All analyses were weighted using a 16‐year sampling weight
created from the 24‐hour dietary recall weights in accordance with
the NHANES Analytic and Reporting Guidelines.16
A subset of adults conducted repeat 24‐hour recalls by telephone
3 to 10 days after the baseline dietary assessment. A high level of
concordance was noted (~82%) in the walnut consumption classifica-
tion between both days.

Measures
2.2.1
|
Dietary intake interview
Dietary intake interviews were conducted in‐person, in the NHANES
mobile examination clinics. The specific types of food as well as the
amount of foods consumed were recalled by survey participants. To
help in assessing the amount of food consumed, recall cue items such
as food charts, measuring cups, and rulers were provided. Survey par-
ticipants were requested to report all foods and beverages consumed
during the past 24 hours from midnight to midnight. National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey dietary data collected from 1999
to 2002 reported individual food intake for 1 day, whereas data
collected from 2003 to 2014 reported individual food intake of a sub-
set for 2 days. To maximize our ability to detect walnut consumers,
data from both days were used in the 2003 to 2014 data, such that
participants reporting walnut consumption in either interview were
classified as consumers and gram amounts were averaged between
the days. Analyses were conducted using the day 1 dietary interviews
weights when a single recall was available.
The NHANES dietary data reports US Department of Agriculture
food codes for all foods reported in the individual dietary intake inter-
views from 1999 to 2014. US Department of Agriculture food codes
were used to identify foods that described or included walnuts by
searching for the word “walnut” in the food code label descriptors
and to identify foods that described or included ON by searching for
the words “nut,” “almond,” “macadamia,” “alpine,” “cashew,” “pecan,”
“pistachio,” and “granola.”
2.2.2
|
Walnut consumption groups
The food codes used to identify walnut consumption are listed in
Table S1. As in our previous publication on walnut consumption and
cognition in NHANES,17 foods consisting entirely or mostly of clearly
identifiable walnuts were classified as “walnuts with high certainty”
(WwHC) and food codes describing nut mixes and foods that are likely
to include walnuts but also ON were classified as “walnuts with other
nuts” (WwON) so that 2 levels of confidence were created, the latter
being diluted by ON and with estimates of amounts of walnut con-
sumed totalled per individual across all foods consumed in that group.
Foods codes describing nuts that are not walnuts (ie cashew nuts and
pistachios) or nut‐containing foods that do not commonly contain wal-
nuts (eg granola) were classified as “ON” to allow comparisons of wal-
nut associations with other nut associations. All other foods that did
not include walnuts or ON were classified as “no nuts” (NN). Partici-
pants were categorized as members of either the WwHC, WwON,
ON, or NN groups. Those who consumed at least one WwHC food
were categorized to the WwHC group. Participants who did not con-
sume WwHC foods but did consume WwON foods were categorized
to the WwON group. Those who did not consume WwHC or
WwON foods but did consume other nut foods were included in the
ON group. Lastly, participants who did not indicate eating any nut‐
containing foods were classified as members of the NN group.

Walnut consumption amounts
To determine the amount of walnuts consumed for each participant of
the WwHC and WwON groups, the food item weights (in grams) were
totalled. In instances where the food item weight was reflective of more
than just walnuts (eg mixed nuts and muffin with nuts), a percentage of
the total weight was used. For these items, the percent weight due to
walnuts was determined by the investigators based on common recipes.

Diabetes outcomes
Five diabetes definitions were used in this study. Three definitions
were based on laboratory results of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and
glycohemoglobin, and 2 definitions were based on questionnaire
responses to diabetes questions and medication usage. Multiple defi-
nitions were used to capture both subjective and objective diabetes
diagnoses and to examine the robustness of our findings.
Self‐reported diabetes
The NHANES questionnaire asked participants if a doctor had ever told
them they had diabetes. Responses were dichotomized as diabetic/
non‐diabetic, with self‐report “borderline diabetes” collapsed with
self‐reported non‐diabetes. Those that reported taking or brought to
the interview any of the following: chlorpropamide, diazoxide, glipizide,
glyburide,
insulin,
tolazamide,
metformin,
acarbose,
glimepiride,
miglitol, troglitazone, repaglinide, rosiglitazone maleate, pioglitazon,
and nateglinide, were classified as a person with diabetes.
Fasting plasma glucose
The NHANES laboratory data from 1999 to 2012 provided FPG
values for interviewed participants. In accordance with guidelines by
the American Diabetes Association,18 participants with FPG greater
than 125 mg/dL were classified as persons with diabetes, participants
with FPG greater than 100 mg/dL and less than or equal to 125 mg/dL
were classified as borderline diabetes, and participants with FPG less
than 100 were classified as persons without diabetes.
Glycohemoglobin
The NHANES laboratory data from 1999 to 2012 also provided data
on percentage glycohemoglobin (HbA1c) for interviewed participants.
Participants with HbA1c greater than or equal to 6.5% (48 mmol/
mol) were classified as persons with diabetes, participants with levels
greater than or equal to 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) and less than 6.5%
(48 mmol/mol) were classified as borderline diabetes, and participants
with levels less than 5.7% (39 mmol/mol) were classified as persons
without diabetes.18
Fasting plasma glucose and haemoglobin A1c
A definition combining high levels of both FPG and HbA1c was used to
identify a second group of undiagnosed and poorly controlled diabe-
tes. Participants who had diabetes based on either the FPG definition
or the A1c definition were classified as having diabetes for the com-
bined definition. Participants were determined to be without diabetes
based on both the FPG definition and the A1c definition. Participants
who did not classify as having diabetes based on either FPG or A1c
level and did not classify as not having diabetes based on both FPG
and A1c levels were categorized as borderline diabetes under the
combined definition.

Covariates
Covariates used in the adjusted analyses were age, gender, race, years
of education, body mass index, alcohol consumption, and levels of
physical activity. The upper bound for the age data collected was
85+ years for NHANES years 1999 to 2007 and 80+ years for
NHANES years 2008 to 2014. For the purposes of this study, age
was winsorized to 80 years to be consistent across all cycles used.
To maintain consistency across the NHANES cycles, 4 categories were
used for race (non‐Hispanic White, non‐Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and
other). Participants categorized as Mexican American and Hispanic
were considered Hispanic. Years of education was calculated as a
continuous variable ranging from 0 to 16.
In years 1999 to 2006, vigorous physical activity was defined as
activity that causes heavy sweating and large increases in breathing
or heart rate, while moderate physical activity was defined as light
sweating or slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate.
National
Health
and
Nutrition
Examination
Survey
participants
were asked if they did any vigorous or moderate activities for at
least 10 minutes over the past 30 days, and were coded based on
these answers for the study. In years 2007 to 2012, participants were
asked if their work involved vigorous or moderate intensity activity for
at least 10 minutes and if they did any vigorous or moderate intensity
recreational activities for at least 10 minutes continuously.
Alcohol consumption was analysed as a dichotomous variable to
maintain consistency across all NHANES cycles used in this study
based on their report of the average number of drinks in the last
12 months.

Statistical analysis
The associations of walnut consumption with diabetes outcomes were
assessed using binary (self‐report diabetes definition) and multinomial
(composite self‐report and objective diabetes definitions) logistic
regression models. Effects for the walnut consumption groups were
based on comparisons to the no nut group. Separate logistic (and mul-
tinomial logistic) regression models were built for each of the 5 diabetes
outcomes with “non‐diabetes” used as the reference outcome category
in each model. Models were additionally adjusted for the aforemen-
tioned covariates. Walnut consumption amounts were standardized
so that effects are reported per 1 standard deviation of the total walnut
grams, which is equivalent to ~1.5 tablespoons of walnuts (a small
handful). Walnut consumption amount analyses were conducted
among groups reporting any walnut consumption (WwON and WwHC)
to assess a dose‐response of walnut consumption. Because the walnut
consumption amount analyses represented a smaller subset of the sam-
ple, the survey sampling properties (strata and primary sampling units)
had insufficient sample size to conduct the variance estimation in 2 of
the 118 sampling strata. These 2 strata were excluded from the walnut
consumption amount analyses, resulting in a loss of 32 participants.
Interactions of walnut consumption groups and amounts with gender
and race were additionally explored. All analyses were weighted using
the 16‐year NHANES sample day 1 dietary weights and used the

Description of sample
Characteristics of the 34 121 participants included in the analysis
are presented in Table 1. These values reflect application of the
appropriate sample weights for the US population over this 15‐year
time period. About 51% of the sample was female. About 67% self‐iden-
tified as non‐Hispanic White, 12% non‐Hispanic Black, and 14% His-
panic. The majority of participants reported having participated in
moderate physical activity within the last 30 days (58%), while a smaller
proportion participated in vigorous physical activity within the last
30 days (38%). Diabetes risk among non‐nut consumers differed widely
depending upon the measure used: 9.4% based on self‐report, 4.0%
based on elevated fasting blood glucose, and 7.3% based on elevated
HbA1c levels. These percentages were at least 50% lower among walnut
consumers: 4.5%, 1,2%, and 3.2%, respectively (Table 2).

Associations of walnut consumption with
diabetes outcomes
Table 3 shows the results of the multivariable logistic (and multinomial
logistic) regression models of diabetes and walnut consumption.
Figure 1 provides a visual comparison of the effect of walnut
consumption on diabetes by diabetes definition. For the self‐report dia-
betes outcome, participants who consumed WwHC foods had half the
odds of diabetes (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 0.47 95%, confidence inter-
val = [0.31, 0.72], P < .001) compared with participants who consumed
NN, after adjusting for covariates. Additionally, those who consumed
ON were 27% less likely to have poorly controlled diabetes relative to
participants who consumed NN (RRR = 0.73, P = .006). Among walnut
consumers, every standard deviation increase in walnut gram consump-
tion, correlated with a 12% decrease in the odds of self‐reported diabe-
tes, although this was not statistically significant (P = .187). No significant
difference in diabetes risk for participants who consumed WwON or ON
were noted as compared with participants who consumed NN.
Using the FPG definition, participants who consumed WwHC
showed a 68% lower relative risk of diabetes compared with participants
who consumed NN (P < .001). For each standard deviation increase in
walnut gram consumption, there was a 37% reduced relative risk of dia-
betes (P = .003). When assessing diabetes based on the A1c or the com-
bined FPG and A1c definition, participants who consumed WwHC had a
49% and 50% reduced relative risk of diabetes compared with partici-
pants who consumed NN respectively (P = .045 and P = .025). However,
among the walnut consumers, there was not a significant dose‐response
association using the walnut consumption amount for either definition
(RRR = 0.94, P = .54 and RRR = 0.85, P = .19).
None of the biochemistry‐based diabetes definitions showed asso-
ciations between WwON and diabetes prevalence relative to the no
nut group. The ON group showed a significant reduction in diabetes
prevalence relative to the NN group for both the A1c (RRR = 0.77,

DISCUSSION
Against a background of meta‐analyses showing heterogeneity in the
relationship between nut consumption and diabetes mellitus, we
examined this with regard to both nuts in general and walnuts specif-
ically in the US population. Individuals who knew they had diabetes as
well as those as yet undiagnosed and those with borderline risk of dia-
betes were examined.
Previously, the Nurses Health Studies I and II found, after 10 years
of follow up, inverse associations between walnut consumption and
risk of type 2 diabetes. These were attenuated after adjusting for body

 mass index.20 Since the participants were all female nurses, external
generalizability of the study is limited. In the broader population of
NHANES, we also found an inverse association between self‐reported
diabetes mellitus and walnut consumption across the entire popula-
tion. When we stratified by gender, there was indication that the asso-
ciation with walnuts might be greater among women than men.
Additionally, in our NHANES analyses, when FPG levels were used
to diagnose diabetes, a strong protective association was noted. This
biomarker‐based analysis is less vulnerable to information bias and
changes in behaviour related to a known diagnosis as might be the case
when individuals change their diet in the hopes of controlling their dis-
ease. When elevated A1c was used instead of fasting glucose levels, nut
associations were not significant. This is not surprising considering dis-
crepancies between the diagnostic values of A1c levels as compared
with plasma glucose levels. An in‐depth assessment of the use of HbA1c
for diagnostic purposes found that the standard ADA cutoffs of HbA1c
for diabetes and prediabetes exhibited low sensitivity in identifying
patients diagnosed using both FPG and 2‐hr glucose.21 Within the
NHANES population, the use of HbA1c resulted in large false‐negative
rates ranging from 65% to 75%. Misdiagnosis rates increased with age
and were disproportionally higher in non‐Hispanic whites and Mexican
Americans when based on HbA1c levels as compared with fasting glu-
cose, resulting in potentially biases assessments. The authors concluded
that HbA1c values below 6.5% (48 mmol/mol) and 5.7% (39 mmol/mol)
do not reliably exclude the presence of diabetes and prediabetes,
respectively. This supports the use of fasting blood glucose as the stron-
ger diagnostic tool. As FPG is the marker more closely associated with
walnut consumption, we suggest that the association between FPG
and walnut consumption is more likely to be of clinical relevance.
Our findings are largely consistent with those of PREDIMED, the
randomized trial conducted in Spain, which suggested that a Mediter-
ranean diet supplemented with 30 g/day nuts (50% walnuts, 25%
almonds, and 25% hazelnuts) significantly reduced risk the incidence
of type 2 diabetes compared with the low‐fat control diet. However,
our findings suggest that walnuts might be outperforming ON. The
greater the certainty of walnut consumption and the greater the
quantity consumed, the stronger the association.
Results from clinical trials, which tested the effect of walnuts on
glycaemic control parameters, did not exhibit improvement in diabetic
parameters with walnut supplementation.4,6,7 In the longest of the 3
studies, lasting 12 months, a significant decrease in plasma insulin
was found (P = .046) in the walnut group.6
Two other studies of whether a walnut enriched diet affected
individuals with metabolic syndrome found no significant changes in
fasting glucose regardless of rather high supplementation of walnut
of either 48 or 63 to 108 g/day.1,5 These studies differed in length
(4 days compared with 8 weeks) and study design (crossover versus
parallel, respectively). Researchers inferred that weight management
is more important than any beneficial effects of walnuts.
Another 8‐week crossover clinical trial, which was performed on
healthy Caucasians lasting 8 weeks, did not find any significant differ-
ences in fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, or HOMA‐IR when a Western
diet was enriched with 43 g of walnuts per day.8 A 6‐week‐long dietary
intervention among women with polycystic ovarian syndrome did not
find differences in fasting glucose, insulin, or HOMA‐IR between the
walnut treatment group (receiving 36 g of walnuts per day) and the con-
trol group.2 However, the researchers did see a significant (P < .0006)
decrease in HbA1c and a faster insulin response time (P = .0182).
One possible mechanism relates to a possbiel walnut‐brain
interaction impacting hunger. A recent well‐designed, randomized,
placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, cross‐over functional magnetic reso-
nance imaging‐based dietary trial on 10 patients consumed walnuts
versus placebo as a smoothie for 5 days. Decreased feelings of hunger
and appetite and increased activation of the right insula to highly
desirable food cues was found.22 Thus, walnuts may impact appetite
and indirectly reduce risk of diabetes. Another theory proposes a role
of inflammation and/or oxidative stress in cardiometabolic disorders.
A recent cohort study examined the influence of adherence to the
Mediterranean diet on oxidative stress and inflammatory biomarkers.
In a 10‐year follow‐up, the incidence of diabetes was related to
medium and high adherence to a Mediterranean diet, with decrease
diabetes risks of 49% and 62% respectively, compared with low
adherence. Their results suggest a possible impact of diet on the
inflammatory mechanisms causing diabetes.23
The contrasting findings among short‐term clinical trials and
effects seen in large free living populations might be explained by
either the trial duration, the timing of effect being to late in the course
of the disease, or the effect of dietary changes being too subtle in a
population that is already heavily treated. Alternatively, in NHANES,
walnut consumers may differ in other ways that are not adequately
controlled for in the analyses. The largest concern with NHANES is
its cross‐sectional nature. Inverse causality might exist due to diag-
nosed individuals knowing their diagnosis, which may change behav-
iour. We approached this challenge by using multiple measures of
diabetes, some of which were unrelated to knowledge of the condi-
tion. Even here, when using fasting glucose, irrespective of self‐report
status, we found a significant association. The substantiation in
PREDIMED, of lower diabetes incidence under an intervention which
included 15 g/day of walnut, adds confidence to a causal assumption.
In the NHANES population, a significant limitation is the
intraindividual variation in consumption of specific foods and amounts
consumed. The categorization of estimated portion sizes and analysis
of nut consumption was based on 24‐hour recall. There is a likelihood
of an underestimation of the effect because of the possibility of indi-
viduals who normally consume nuts not eating them on the specific
report days. As the analysis found a significant relationship even given
these limitations, the effect noted is likely diluted by measurement
error and may actually be stronger.
Along with the change in beliefs that nuts, being a source of high
calories, are undesirable transitioning to belief that nuts are valuable
sources of health fats, fibre, nut consumption is changing in the United
States. Fortunately, the NHANES data and analyses in this study
largely predate this swing in behaviour. The disadvantage, however,
is the relatively lower prevalence of walnut consumers in the older
rounds of NHANES. Because of this we are unable to examine effects
robustly among subgroups. We detect interactions, but our analyses
are not powered to adequately explore them.
Another advantage of the older consumption behaviour, which
was not likely driven by health awareness, is that consumption is not
likely to be biased by disease concerns. This report adds to the

ETHICS STATEMENT
This study involved secondary data analysis of a nationally representa-
tive publicly available dataset. The study we conducted was exempt
from institutional review for this reason. We have conducted multiple
food‐based analyses to determine healthy dietary patterns. This was
conducted because of our interest in the value of nuts in the diet in
light of their caloric contributions to the diet. We did receive financial
support from the California Walnut Commission but in line with UCLA
policies they had no involvement in the analyses, interpretation,
writing, or editing of the manuscript or publishing of the findings.
