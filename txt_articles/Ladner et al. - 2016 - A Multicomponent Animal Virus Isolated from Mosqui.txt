 SUMMARY
RNA viruses exhibit a variety of genome organization strategies, including multicomponent 
genomes in which each segment is packaged separately. While multicomponent genomes are 
common among viruses infecting plants and fungi, their prevalence among those infecting animals 
remains unclear. We characterize a multicomponent RNA virus isolated from mosquitoes, 
designated Guaico Culex virus (GCXV). GCXV belongs to a diverse clade of segmented viruses 
(Jingmenvirus) related to the prototypically unsegmented Flaviviridae. The GCXV genome 
comprises five segments, each of which appears to be separately packaged. The smallest segment 
is not required for replication, and its presence is variable in natural infections. We also describe a 
variant of Jingmen tick virus, another Jingmenvirus, sequenced from a Ugandan red colobus 
monkey, thus expanding the host range of this segmented and likely multicomponent virus group. 
Collectively, this study provides evidence for the existence of multicomponent animal viruses and 
their potential relevance for animal and human health.
Graphical Abstract
INTRODUCTION
The diversity of genome organizations seen in RNA viruses is truly exceptional, surpassing 
that of any other group of organisms (Holmes, 2009). Differences are seen in the nature of 
the genetic material (single or double-stranded, positive or negative-sense, linear or circular), 
the number of genome segments (from 1 to 12) and the manner in which multi-segmented 
genomes are packaged (together or separately) (King et al., 2011). These differences can 
have important functional implications for key processes such as gene expression, 
transmission and genetic recombination. Genome segmentation, for example, can allow for 
better control over gene expression by creating multiple distinct transcriptional units 
(Holmes, 2009); however, if these segments are separately packaged, a higher multiplicity of 
infection will be needed for successful transmission (Goldbach, 1986).

 While great strides have been made in cataloging viral diversity, the evolutionary 
mechanisms that have generated this extraordinary variety of genomic organizations are still 
poorly understood. This is due, in part, to the extensive genetic divergence that exists 
between most viruses with different organizations (typically present in distinct families), 
thus preventing meaningful sequence-based evolutionary comparisons. Occasionally though, 
more recent transitions are uncovered and analysis of these events provides insight into the 
macroevolution of RNA viruses. Qin et al. (2014) reported just such a connection between 
segmented and unsegmented RNA viruses by describing a segmented virus (Jingmen tick 
virus, JMTV) with sequence homology to the Flaviviridae, a large family of vertebrate and 
invertebrate viruses (including a number of important human pathogens, e.g., Zika, yellow 
fever, West Nile, dengue, Japanese encephalitis and Hepatitis C viruses) with unsegmented, 
positive-sense RNA genomes.
Here, we expand upon this finding by describing a genetically distinct, segmented virus 
isolated from mosquitoes that also exhibits homology to viruses in the family Flaviviridae, 
and which appears to be multicomponent [a.k.a., multiparticle or multipartite (Holmes, 
2009; Mahy, 2009; Reijnders, 1978)], with each genome segment separately packaged into 
virions. Although multicomponent genomes are relatively common among RNA viruses that 
infect plants and fungi, this method of genome organization has not previously been seen in 
animal viruses (Fulton, 1980; King et al., 2011). This virus has tentatively been designated 
Guaico Culex virus (GCXV), based on the first collection location (near the Guaico 
community in Trinidad) and the genus of the mosquito that appears to serve as its primary 
host. Through phylogenetic analysis, we demonstrate that GCXV and JMTV both belong to 
a highly diverse clade of segmented (and likely multicomponent) viruses, which has recently 
been coined the Jingmenvirus group (Shi et al., 2015). We also report the detection of a 
variant of JMTV in a red colobus monkey in Uganda, thus expanding the host range of 
Jingmenviruses to include primates and highlighting the potential relevance of these viruses 
to animal and human health.
RESULTS
Genome Characterization of GCXV
We sequenced six isolates of GCXV from Culex spp. mosquitoes collected in three countries 
in Central and South America (Table 1). Complete genomes were obtained for the isolates 
from Peru (LO35, LO47) and Trinidad (TR7094); Coding-complete [i.e. only missing pieces 
of non-coding UTRs (Ladner et al., 2014)] genomes were obtained for the isolates from 
Panama (GAM204, PCR18–229, ACH27). Five genome segments were assembled for four 
of the isolates (LO35, LO47, GAM204 and PCR18–229), resulting in a total genome size of 
~12 kb. RNA extracted from purified GCXV particles confirmed the presence of a 
segmented genome (Figure 1A).
However, only four segments were assembled for ACH27 and TR7094 (genome size ~10.6 
kb). For these two isolates, the four assembled segments corresponded to the four largest 
segments assembled in the other isolates (Figure 1, segments 1–4). The mosquito pools for 
both ACH27 and TR7094 contained multiple viruses capable of replicating in mosquito 
cells, so we were unable to obtain pure cultures for these isolates (Auguste et al., 2014).

 However, despite the complexity of these pools, very high sequencing depth was obtained 
for the four assembled segments (ACH27: 16,700 −40,500x; TR7094: 970 - 11,680x). 
TR7094 contained very low-levels of LO47 contamination (all five segments), but for 
ACH27, no Illumina reads aligned to the segment 5 sequences from the other isolates, and 
no contigs from ACH27 exhibited significant similarity to the segment 5 sequences from the 
other isolates. Therefore, segment 5 appears to be absent from ACH27 and TR7094.
Nuclease digestion assays (Figure 1B), along with 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA 
ends (RACE), confirmed that all five genome segments were single-stranded, positive-sense 
RNA (ssRNA+). Among the GCXV isolates, pairwise nt divergences, calculated separately 
for each segment, ranged from 0.2% to 19.9% (Table S4). The phylogenies inferred from 
segments 2–4 all exhibited essentially identical patterns with isolates clustered by 
geographic location and with TR7094 as the outlier (Figure 2B). However, on segment 1, 
TR7094 exhibited lower than expected relative levels of divergence and grouped closely 
with the Panamanian isolates. This is likely indicative of a segment 1 reassortment event 
having occurred on the lineage leading to TR7094. The phylogeny inferred from segment 5 
is also inconsistent with those of the other segments. In addition to the absence of this 
segment in TR7094 and ACH27, this segment exhibited very low levels of nucleotide 
divergence (0.4–2.3%), with most sequence variations only present in a single isolate.
Rescue through Reverse Genetics
A reverse genetics system was established to test the ability of GCXV to replicate in the 
absence of segment 5. C6/36 cells were separately transfected with three combinations of in 
vitro transcribed RNA segments: a) all five segments, b) segments 1–4 and c) segments 2–5 
[i.e., no RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); used as a negative control]. No 
cytopathic effect (CPE) was detected in the negative control (segments 2–5), and quantitative 
reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) confirmed the absence of replication. CPE was 
observed in the other two transfections (segments 1–5 and 1–4) and RNA extracted after 
post-transfection passages confirmed the establishment of successful infections both with 
and without segment 5 (Figure 2A).
Segment Packaging
Multicomponent plant viruses were recognized based on deviations from the expected 
relationship between infectious dose and the number of lesions on infected leaves [i.e. 
exhibiting multi-hit rather than single-hit kinetics (Flint et al., 2009; Sanchez-Navarro et al., 
2013)]. We utilized a similar approach to assay the nature of segment packaging for GCXV 
using cell culture plaques instead of leaf lesions. The dose-response curve for GCXV 
differed significantly from expectations for a single component virus (i.e. the number of 
plaques decreased more quickly than expected with dilution of the inoculant) (Figure 3) 
(Flint et al., 2009). Assuming the presence of distinct particles (each containing a subset of 
genome segments) present in similar amounts and with the same likelihood of invading a 
cell, we used our dose-response curve to estimate the presence of 3.27±0.37 distinct GCXV 
particles required for plaque formation. Deviations from this assumption (e.g. variation in 
the abundance of and/or probability of cell invasion for different particle types), would lead 
to a shallower slope and underestimation of the number of distinct particle types. Therefore, 
Ladner et al.

 this result is consistent with 3–5 segments being required for plaque formation, assuming 
that each segment is separately packaged.
Visualizing Transcription/Replication
Segment-specific probe sets were used to visualize GCXV transcription/replication within 
C6/36 cells. We detected viral RNA using two combinations of probes: 1) segments 1–3 and 
2) segments 3–5. At least one genome segment was detected in ≥90% of the assayed cells, 
and, in general, when multiple segments were present, they appeared to be colocalized in the 
cytoplasm (Figure 4). Segments 1–3 were detected together in all positive cells, whereas 
segments 4 and 5 were variably present within cells where segment 3 was detected (Figure 
4, Table S1). The detection of different combinations of segments within individual cells is 
consistent with independent packaging of genome segments. While most segments are likely 
required to successfully complete a full cycle of infection, only a subset of segments are 
likely required for viral transcription/replication. However, we cannot rule out the presence 
of undetected segments below our limit of detection.
Untranslated Regions
None of the segments of GCXV were polyadenylated; however, sequence conservation 
across segments was seen in the untranslated regions (UTRs; Figure S2). The 5′ UTRs 
exhibited several highly conserved sequence motifs, including the nine most terminal 
nucleotides (nt), which were strictly conserved across all segments/isolates (5′-
AAAUUAAAA-3′), and a larger region just downstream, which is predicted to form a 28–
31 base stem-loop structure (Figure S2A). The 3′ UTRs also exhibited regions of sequence 
conservation across segments, particularly at the 3′ terminus. While some sequence 
variation was seen on segment 3, the last 7 nt were highly conserved across segments/
isolates, with a consensus sequence of 5′-CCCAUUU-3′. Notably, the four most terminal 
nucleotides at the 5′ and 3′ ends were complimentary. A second highly conserved motif 
was seen in the 3′ UTRs of segments 1–4 (5′-AAWUAC-3′). This is predicted to form the 
distal loop in a conserved stem-loop, although the exact size and structure of the stem-loop 
varies across segments (Figure S2).
Coding Strategy
Three of the genome segments were monocistronic; while the other two each contained three 
open reading frames (ORFs) ≥400 nt (Figure 1C). The sizes and positions of the predicted 
ORFs were highly conserved, with the exception of viral protein (VP) 6, for which the 
position of the first AUG differed substantially across isolates (Table S2). The two largest 
segments each encoded a single ORF, and both exhibited significant protein-level similarity 
to non-structural (NS) domains that are conserved within the genus Flavivirus. The putative 
non-structural protein (NSP) 1 on segment 1 exhibited significant similarity (e-value = 
5.02e−28) to Pfam’s Flavi_NS5 family (PF00972), which corresponds to the RdRp, and 
Pfam’s FtsJ-like methyltransferase family (1.92e−4, PF01728). The methyltransferase 
domain in flaviviruses is required for the formation of the 5′ cap (Dong et al., 2008). The 
putative NSP2 protein on segment 2 exhibited significant similarity to three Pfam families/
domains, all of which correspond to the Flavivirus NS3 protein: Peptidase_S7 (5.17e−9, 
PF00949), Flavi_DEAD (2.83e−18, PF07652) and Helicase_C (8.01e−6, PF00271). These

 results suggest that NSP2 participates in at least two of the roles typically played by the 
Flavivirus NS3: serine protease activity typically used to cleave polypeptides into their 
mature forms and helicase activity likely involved in viral replication.
The three smallest segments exhibited no significant sequence similarity to known proteins. 
Five of the six predicted ORFs from segments 3 and 4 were detected in the proteogenomic 
analysis of viral particles (Figure S3A, Table S3). This suggests that these segments likely 
encode structural proteins; however, peptides from the putative NSP2 were also detected, so 
the purified sample may have had some non-structural protein “contamination.” Although 
VP2 was not detected with the proteogenomic data, an analysis of synonymous nucleotide 
conservation (Firth, 2014), in the reading frame of VP1, supports the existence of a 
functional VP2 ORF (Figure S3B). Segments 3 and 4 both exhibited evidence for −1 
ribosomal frameshifting. In both cases this included 1) overlapping ORFs in the expected 
orientation; 2) a known slippery heptanucleotide sequence at the end of the first ORF 
(Figure 1C); 3) predicted secondary structure just after the slippery sequence (Figure S3 C 
and D) and; 4) the detection of peptide sequences within the second participating ORF, but 
prior to the first conserved AUG (Figure S3A).
Morphology and Host Specificity
Purified GCXV particles (20–70% sucrose gradient) were 30–35 nm in diameter, spherical 
and enveloped (Figure S4A). Treatment with NP40 ablated infectivity, confirming the 
enveloped nature of the virus (Figure 1D). Multiple attempts to definitively identify viral 
particles within infected C6/36 cells using electron microscopy were unsuccessful; however, 
infected cells contained intracytosolic vacuoles loaded with vesicles 40–50 nm in diameter 
and dense particles ~20nm in diameter (Figure S4B). Vesicles of the same type were also 
observed at the cell surface. This is similar to the pathology previously observed for 
flavivirus infected C6/36 cells.
Viral replication was detected in three mosquito cell lines and in intrathoracically inoculated 
adult female mosquitoes (Figure S5A, B). However, no replication was detected in tick, 
sandfly or vertebrate-derived cells (Figure S5A,C), nor did the virus cause any observable 
illness in intracerebrally inoculated newborn mice, which is often a permissive environment 
for arbovirus replication. Virus was not detected in the larval progeny of infected 
mosquitoes, suggesting either the absence or a low occurrence of vertical transmission. No 
substantial mortality was observed in mosquitoes that survived inoculations during the 14-
day viral growth curve, suggesting that GCXV is non-lethal in its mosquito hosts.
Identification of a Jingmenvirus in a Primate Host
We sequenced one variant of JMTV (RC27) directly from plasma collected from a red 
colobus monkey in Uganda. A draft genome (Ladner et al., 2014) was obtained with 70.6% 
to 98.1% coverage for each of the four genome segments that have been described for JMTV 
(Shi et al., 2015). RC27 exhibited high similarity to isolates from ticks: 88–92.6% nt identity 
across all four segments compared to SY84 from China (Qin et al., 2014) and MGTV from 
Brazil (Maruyama et al., 2014). In species-level phylogenetic analyses, the Chinese isolates 
(Qin et al., 2014) formed a distinct clade compared to the isolates from Uganda and Brazil 
Ladner et al.

 (Figure S6). Of note, RC27 contained a 450 nt deletion relative to SY84 and MGTV within 
the ORF of segment 2 [numbered according to (Shi et al., 2015)]. This deletion was 
observed in reads from metagenomic sequencing and confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger 
sequencing. Attempts to isolate this virus on a variety of cell lines were unsuccessful.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Despite high levels of divergence, both the NS3 and NS5 phylogenies support the segmented 
Jingmenviruses as a monophyletic group (83–99% bootstrap support), which is sister to the 
Tamana bat virus (TABV) and the Flavivirus genus (Figure 5). The Jingmenviruses collected 
from insect hosts form a well-supported (69–100% bootstrap support) sub-clade within this 
group.
DISCUSSION
Here we describe a segmented virus that is distantly related to the flaviviruses, which we 
have tentatively designated GCXV. In vitro and in vivo replication experiments suggest 
GCXV is mosquito-specific, but we cannot definitively rule out replication in other 
organisms. In contrast to the prototypical flavivirus (i.e., unsegmented, single polyprotein), 
the genome of GCXV is composed of 4–5 distinct segments depending on the isolate. The 
four largest segments were found in all isolates and are therefore assumed to be necessary 
for infection and transmission, whereas the fifth segment seems to be optional. VP7 peptides 
were not detected in purified GCXV virions, suggesting that segment 5 likely encodes a non-
structural protein. There was no correlation between the presence/absence of this fifth 
segment and phylogenetic relationships, as inferred from the four ‘core’ segments (Figure 
2B), and in vitro experiments confirmed that GCXV can replicate without segment 5. 
Similarly, natural isolates of Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus (BNYVV, ssRNA+) have been 
described with both 4 and 5 genome segments; the fifth segment is not required for 
successful infection or transmission, but when present, is thought to play a role in 
modulating pathogenesis (Tamada et al., 1989). Also similar to BNYVV, GCXV appears to 
individually package its genome segments (i.e. is multicomponent). Although a 
multicomponent organization is not required for segment loss, it provides a straightforward 
mechanism for the establishment of infections with a subset of genome segments.
Multicomponent genome organizations are relatively common among viruses that infect 
plants and fungi, but no multicomponent animal viruses have been described (Fulton, 1980; 
King et al., 2011). The dose-response kinetics of GCXV indicate that at least three different 
particles are required for plaque formation. Given that the vast majority of animal viruses 
require only a single particle to form a plaque (Flint et al., 2009), this result provides strong 
evidence for a multicomponent virus. Our results from RNA FISH and electron microscopy 
are also consistent with GCXV being multicomponent. While segments 1–3 were detected in 
all infected cells, segments 4 and 5 were variably present, and the measured particle size for 
GCXV, ~30–35 nm, is considerably smaller than that of other flaviviruses. In fact, the 
spherical volume calculated from this size lies below the 95% confidence limit calculated by 
Cui et al. (2014) for viruses with 12 kb genomes. Similar to the flaviviruses, however, 
Ladner et al.

 GCXV particles are enveloped, whereas particles from the multicomponent viruses known to 
infect plants and fungi do not contain envelopes.
Multiple theories have been proposed regarding potential benefits of segmented genomes; 
however, it is unclear whether independent packaging could provide additional benefits 
[over packaging within a single virion (Fulton, 1980; Pressing and Reanney, 1984; 
Reijnders, 1978)] or whether this arrangement may simply be a byproduct of the mechanism 
of segmentation [most likely the formation of complimentary defective viral particles 
(García-Arriaza et al., 2004)]. It has been proposed that multicomponent viruses may 
represent specialized forms of unsegmented genomes, which are facilitated by the existence 
of efficient mechanisms of transmission. In fact, transmission inefficiency is thought to be 
the primary reason for the general lack of multicomponent animal viruses (Goldbach, 1986). 
Vertical transmission has been shown to be the primary mechanism for the insect-specific 
Culex flavivirus (CxFV) (Bolling et al., 2012); however, vertical transmission was not 
detected in our experiments with GCXV. Further investigation into the transmission 
mechanism for GCXV will provide insight into the transmission requirements for 
multicomponent viruses and the unequal distribution of these viruses among eukaryotic 
lineages.
In addition to GCXV, several other segmented, flavi-like viruses have been reported. These 
viruses have tentatively been coined Jingmenviruses (Shi et al., 2015). JMTV and Mogiana 
tick virus (MGTV) are two highly similar (88–90% identical, nt-level), segmented viruses 
that have been isolated from cattle ticks (Rhipicephalus microplus) in China (Qin et al., 
2014) and Brazil (Maruyama et al., 2014), respectively. Here we report an additional virus 
with high similarity to JMTV, which we detected in the blood of a non-human primate in 
Uganda. Additionally, eight JMTV-like viruses have been sequenced from insects collected 
in China (Shi et al., 2015), England and Kenya (Webster et al., 2015) (Table 2). Qin et al. 
(2014) have also demonstrated that four highly-expressed transcripts isolated from a larval 
roundworm (Toxocara canis) (Callister et al., 2008) are actually of viral origin and exhibit 
homology to JMTV. This virus has tentatively been named T. canis larva agent (TCLA) (Qin 
et al., 2014). Our analysis supports this group of segmented viruses as a monophyletic clade 
that includes GCXV. Furthermore, we found that GCXV belongs to a well-supported sub-
clade within the Jingmenvirus group, which is composed exclusively of the viruses that have 
been isolated from insects. Along with the extensive divergence of the lineages containing 
the tick/mammal and roundworm viruses, this finding suggests the presence of sub-groups 
within the Jingmenviruses that are specialized for different types of hosts.
All of the sequenced Jingmenviruses appear to have at least four genome segments and 
homology can be inferred for at least three of these segments across all viruses. Although 
MGTV was not initially recognized as being segmented, we used the published Illumina 
dataset [SRR525284 (Maruyama et al., 2014)] to assemble nearly full length contigs with 
sequence homology to all four segments of JMTV (see Supplemental Experimental 
Procedures). Similarly, while Webster et al. (2015) only reported one segment (encoding the 
putative RdRp) for the three Jingmenviruses they sequenced, we identified several additional 
contigs in their dataset with significant sequence homology to segments 1–4 from GCXV 
(see Supplemental Experimental Procedures). All of these viruses contain separate

 monocistronic segments with sequence homology to the Flavivirus NS3 and NS5 proteins. 
Additionally, they all have one multi-cistronic segment with two partially overlapping ORFs, 
consistent with −1 ribosomal frameshifting; the first ORF is predicted to have a signal 
peptide and the second contains many predicted transmembrane helices. Protein sequence 
homology is detectable for this segment between TCLA (ANT-3) and JMTV/MGTV 
(segment 4), and also among the nine insect-associated viruses, including GCXV [segment 4 
in (Shi et al., 2015), segment 3 for GCXV]. However, no sequence-level similarity is 
detectable for this segment between these two groups. GCXV, JMTV and TCLA all exhibit 
some degree of sequence conservation (across segments) in the non-coding UTRs (Callister 
et al., 2008; Qin et al., 2014), and these regions may play a role in the initiation of 
translation and/or replication.
Based on the apparent homology of at least three segments, it is likely that the 
Jingmenviruses shared a segmented common ancestor. The existence of a common, 
segmented ancestor suggests that the multicomponent organization seen in GCXV is likely 
also shared by the other Jingmenviruses. However, the method of packaging has not been 
investigated in any of these other viruses.
Despite a common origin, levels of sequence divergence among the different Jingmenviruses 
were high. In fact, average levels of amino acid divergence among the Jingmenviruses (NS5: 
59.8%, NS3: 70.2%) were higher than the maximum divergence seen among viruses within 
the Flavivirus genus (NS5: 57%, NS3: 69%). Structural differences are also evident among 
the Jingmenviruses. These differences include genome segments with distinct coding 
strategies and no measurable homology (e.g., GCXV multicistronic segment 4 versus JMTV 
monocistronic segment 2) and the presence of polyadenylated 3’ termini only in JMTV/
MGTV and TCLA (Table 2). Based on the extensive sequence-level and structural genomic 
diversity, this clade of segmented flavi-like viruses appears to be quite old, and it likely 
includes substantial viral diversity that has yet to be described.
Due to the high levels of divergence and the lack of an appropriate outgroup, it is not 
possible to use sequence information to accurately determine the polarity of the transition 
between segmented and unsegmented genomes. One possibility is that the segmented 
genome is ancestral, and that these pieces were later joined together to form the prototypical, 
unsegmented flavivirus genome. Such a transition could be mediated by repeated episodes of 
non-homologous copy-choice recombination (Simon-Loriere and Holmes, 2011); however, 
to our knowledge no such transitions have been described. The alternative is that these 
segmented viruses evolved from an unsegmented ancestor. Phylogenetic analysis of the 
Tetraviridae supports a similar transition between the betatetraviruses (monopartite) and the 
omegatetraviruses (bipartite), which is hypothesized to have been mediated through the 
formation of subgenomic RNA molecules (Zeddam et al., 2010).
Based on the lack of sequence similarity to flaviviruses at two of four segments (those 
thought to encode the structural proteins), Qin et al. (2014) argue that JMTV is likely of 
hybrid origin, resulting from the coinfection of a flavivirus and a second, as of yet, 
uncharacterized virus. Although we cannot rule out this scenario, segmentation of a single 
flavivirus-like ancestor presents a more parsimonious explanation. The patterns of sequence

 divergence/similarity seen between members of the genus Flavivirus and both JMTV and 
GCXV are as expected between very divergent flaviviruses, with weak but significant 
similarity at the highly conserved non-structural genes, but a lack of detectable homology at 
the structural genes, which typically exhibit higher rates of evolution (Chambers et al., 
1990). In fact, this is exactly the same pattern seen between GCXV and JMTV. Therefore, in 
the absence of an identified “donor” group for the putative structural genes of JMTV and 
GCXV, the most parsimonious scenario involves the segmentation of a single, flavivirus-like 
ancestor.
In summary, we have described a multicomponent virus, which belongs to a diverse clade of 
segmented viruses related to the family Flaviviridae. We have also described a variant of 
JMTV, the prototype species for this clade, from a non-human primate, thus substantially 
expanding the host range of the group and indicating potential implications for animal and 
human health. This clade establishes a strong link between two distinct genome 
organizations, which may help to uncover some of the mysteries associated with the 
evolution of genome architecture in RNA viruses; however, methods of inference beyond 
sequence-level homology will be needed to reconstruct the evolutionary history that 
connects these genome types. The existence of an enveloped, multicomponent animal virus 
will require us to rethink historical perspectives regarding the advantages and requirements 
of this type of genome organization.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
GCXV Isolation and Sequencing
Mosquitoes were collected in Panama, Peru and Trinidad during 2008 – 2013 as a part of 
several surveillance studies looking for arbo- and insect-specific viruses (Table 1) (Auguste 
et al., 2010; Vasilakis et al., 2014). In total, six isolates of GCXV were detected through 
random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. In each case, the virus was obtained 
from a collection of mosquitoes pooled based on species and collection locality. Each pool 
was homogenized and clarified supernatant was inoculated onto monolayers of an Aedes 
albopictus mosquito derived cell line, C6/36. The homogenate from five of these pools 
resulted in CPE. In these cases, the cell culture supernatant was preserved in TRIzol LS and 
RNA was extracted using Direct-zol™ RNA MiniPrep (Zymo, Irvine, CA). For the pool that 
did not exhibit CPE (ACH27), RNA was extracted directly from the mosquito homogenate 
using the same protocol. The RNA was then amplified using sequence-independent single 
primer amplification, as described previously (Djikeng et al., 2008). Amplicons were 
sheared to ~400 bp and used as starting material for Illumina TRUseq DNA libraries. 
Sequencing was performed on a MiSeq using either 300 or 500 cycle kits (2 × 150, 2 × 250). 
Cutadapt (Martin, 2011) and Prinseq-lite (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) were used to trim 
primers and remove poor quality reads, respectively, and then genomes were assembled 
using Ray Meta (Boisvert et al., 2012) in combination with custom scripts. For three of the 
isolated viruses, the terminal ends were determined using the SMARTer RACE cDNA 
Amplification kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA). In order to ensure detection of the most 
3′ terminal base and to test for the presence of a polyadenylated 3′ terminus, 3′ RACE was

 conducted using both poly-A and poly-U polymerases. For one isolate (LO35) the genome 
sequence was verified with Sanger sequencing.
Sequence Analysis
TMHMM version 2.0 (Krogh et al., 2001) was used to predict transmembrane helical 
segments and SignalP version 4.1 (Petersen et al., 2011) was used to identify signal peptide 
sequences. MFOLD/Quickfold (Zuker, 2003) and RNAstructure (Reuter and Mathews, 
2010) were used to predict RNA secondary structures.
MEGA version 5 (Tamura et al., 2011) was used to conduct species-level nucleotide 
alignments using MUSCLE, to calculate pairwise divergences (p-distance with pairwise 
deletion) and to construct maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with 1000 bootstrap 
replicates (Tamura-Nei model, uniform rates, complete deletion). The Pfam database (Punta 
et al., 2012) was searched using CD-search (Marchler-Bauer and Bryant, 2004) to identify 
conserved protein domains. Family-wide amino acid alignments (see Table S5 for list of 
sequences included) were conducted using the E-INS-I algorithm in MAFFT version 7 
(Katoh and Standley, 2013) and trimAl was used to trim ambiguously aligned positions 
(Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009). Trees were built using both neighbor-joining (MEGA, JTT 
substitution model, pairwise deletion, uniform rates) and maximum-likelihood [PhyML 
version 3.1 (Guindon et al., 2010), LG substitution model Γ-distributed rate variation] 
methods with 100 bootstrap replicates.
Nuclease Digestion
To test the nature of the genomic material, nucleic acids extracted from GCXV-LO35 were 
separately incubated in the presence of DNase I (Ambion), RNase I (Thermo Fisher), and 
nuclease-free water at 37°C for 20 minutes. After incubation, the sample was cleaned 
(Direct-zol™) and cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript® III (Invitrogen) with random 
hexamers. Segment-specific amplicons were generated for each treatment to test for the 
presence of intact genomic segments (see Table S6 for primers).
Rescue by Reverse Genetics
All five genome segments of GCXV-LO35 were amplified by RT-PCR with forward primers 
that included the T7 RNA polymerase promoter at the 5′ end. Three combinations 
(segments 1–5, 1–4 and 2–5) of the full length amplicons were mixed in equimolar amounts 
and the mixtures were used to produce RNA by in vitro transcription using the 
MessageMAX T7 kit (CellScript), which produces a mixture of capped and uncapped 
RNAs. The in vitro transcribed RNAs were transfected into C6/36 cells (Mirus TransIT 
mRNA), and the cells were monitored for changes in morphology. After changes were 
detected, a small amount of supernatant from the transfected cells was passaged onto fresh 
C6/36 cells for 1–2 passages before viral RNA was isolated from the supernatants of the 
infected cells.
Plaque Assay
C6/36 cells were seeded in 6-well plates so that the cells would be 90–100% confluent the 
following day. A 1.5-fold serial dilution series was generated with GCXV-LO35 stocks 
Ladner et al.

 using complete medium. Diluted virus (500 µl) was added to each of 5 wells of the plate; the 
6th well served as a no-virus control. Virus was allowed to bind to the C6/36 cells for 1 hour 
at room temperature with gentle rocking every 15 minutes. The virus inoculum was then 
removed from the wells, the wells were washed with PBS to remove any unbound viruses 
and 2 ml of overlay (1% tragacanth in complete medium) was added to each well. After a 4-
day incubation at 28 °C, the overlay was gently removed and cells were fixed with 4% 
paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were stained with crystal violet to visualize plaques. A 
Poisson generalized linear model was used to estimate the multiplicity of infection.
RNA FISH
Probe sets for RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were designed using the 
Stellaris Probe Designer and synthesized by Biosearch Technologies (Petaluma, CA). One 
probe set (40–48 distinct probes) was designed for each segment using the GCXV-LO35 
genome sequence; each set was labeled with one of three fluorophores: Quasar 570, Quasar 
670 or FAM (Table S7). Two sets of probes (segments 1–3 and 3–5) were independently 
hybridized to C6/36 cell cultures 24 hours after inoculation with GCXV-LO35 (see 
Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). DAPI (300 nM in PBS) was used for 
nuclei detection. Ten images of infected cells (20x magnification) and one of mock-infected 
cells were obtained for each probe set. Individual cells were identified and fluorescent 
intensities were quantified using the Columbus software package (PerkinElmer Waltham, 
MA, USA). To be conservative regarding segment presence/absence, cells were only counted 
if all assayed segments had intensities that were either a) greater than the maximum intensity 
observed in the mock-infected cells (considered present) or b) lower than the average 
intensity observed in the mock-infected cells (considered absent).
Virus Purification
To isolate virions, cell culture supernatant was purified on a 20–70% continuous sucrose 
gradient (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). To test for the presence of 
an envelope, virion infectivity was assayed using the sucrose-purified particles following 
treatment with the anionic detergent, NP40, at concentrations of 0.05%, 0.1%, and 0.25% for 
30 min. Both treated and untreated samples were assayed for infectivity on C6/36 cells using 
CPE assays as well as qRT-PCR to assess growth kinetics. Transmission electron 
microscopy was used to visualize individual viral particles as well as infected C6/36 cells 
(see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details).
Proteogenomics
Mass spectrometry-based proteomics was used to aid in the annotation of the GCXV 
genome, including the identification of structural proteins (Jaffe et al., 2004). Briefly, 
purified virions were fractionated through polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and 
divided into 20 samples. Each individual fraction was trypsin digested and the peptides were 
analyzed using a single-segment data-dependent 30000 resolution MS1 scan followed by 
ms/ms rapid scans of the 15 highest intensity ions. Peptides were searched against a database 
that contained all potential protein ORFs in the GCXV-LO35 genome plus 8,873 Aedes 
albopictus sequences from the NCBI protein non-redundant database. For a detailed 
methodology, see Supplemental Experimental Procedures.

 In vitro Culture of GCXV
A variety of vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines were used to determine infectivity and 
viral growth of GCXV-LO35: three derived from mammals (Vero, Chlorocebus sabaeus; 
HeLa, Homo sapiens; BHK-21 Mesocricetus auratus), one avian (DF-1, Gallus gallus), three 
from mosquitoes (C6/36, Aedes albopictus; Culex tarsalis; Aag2, Aedes aegypti), one from a 
sandfly (LL-5, Lutzomyia longipalpis) and one from a tick (ISE6, Ixodes scapularis). Using 
supernatant from GCXV-infected C6/36 cells as the inoculum, one-step growth curves were 
conducted with one time point per day; qRT-PCR was used to quantify viral concentration.
Mosquito Infections
Viral replication was also assayed in adult mosquitoes (Aedes albopictus and Culex 
quinquefasciatus). Briefly, mosquitoes were intrathoracically inoculated with 0.5 µL of 
GCXV-L035 at 108 genome copies/mL and viral copy number was estimated using qRT-
PCR at four time points [1, 4, 7, and 14 days post inoculation (dpi)]. For vertical 
transmission studies, intrathoracically inoculated Culex quinquefasciatus mosquitoes were 
offered blood meals at 7 dpi to induce the production of eggs, which were reared to fourth 
instar larvae and then assayed for the presence of GCXV-L035. See Supplemental 
Experimental Procedures for details.
Inoculation of mice
Culture media from C6/36 cells infected with GCXV-L047, L035 and TR7094 were used to 
inoculate a litter (n = 10) of 2-day-old CD1 mice intracerebrally. Mice were observed for 
signs of illness for 14 days. Animal experiments were carried out under a protocol approved 
by the UTMB Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.
JMTV Sequencing
With the approval of the Uganda Wildlife Authority, the Uganda National Council for 
Science and Technology, and the University of Wisconsin Animal Care and Use Committee, 
plasma was collected from a red colobus monkey (Procolobus rufomitratus) on February 2, 
2012 in Kibale National Park, Uganda. This animal showed no signs of disease at the time of 
sampling. This sample was processed as described previously (Sibley et al., 2014). Briefly, 
viral RNA was isolated from 1 mL of plasma (Qiagen QIAamp MinElute virus kit, Qiagen, 
Hilden, Germany), treated with DNase I (DNA-free, Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), and 
converted to double-stranded cDNA using random hexamers (Superscript double-stranded 
cDNA Synthesis kit, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Purified cDNA was sequenced on an 
Illumina MiSeq using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, 
CA, USA). Sequence data were analyzed using CLC Genomics Workbench version 8.5 
(CLC bio, Aarhus, Denmark) (see Supplemental Experimental Procedures for details). 
JMTV contigs and unassembled reads were identified based on nucleotide-level (blastn) 
similarity to published JMTV sequences (GenBank). Gaps in the de novo assembly were 
filled using PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing with primers designed using the de 
novo contigs/reads as well as the complete genome from the original JMTV isolate (SY84, 
GenBank: KJ001579-KJ001582).

 Figure 3. 
The dose-response curve for GCXV supports a multicomponent genome organization. 
Plaque count is shown on the y-axis and the relative dilution of the virus stock is shown on 
the x-axis. The analysis included 5 replicates per dilution (circles). The black line is the best-
fitting line from a Poisson generalized linear model, with 95% confidence intervals (grey 
band). The grey lines represent expected slopes for multiplicities of infection of 1–5.

 Figure 4. 
Multiple combinations of GCXV genome segments were detected in infected cells. A 
representative 63x magnification image is shown from the co-hybridization of probes for 
segments 3–5. Four different infected cell types were observed: closed arrowhead – missing 
segments 4 and 5; open arrowhead – missing segment 5; full arrow – missing segment 4 
(note: segment 5 present in low abundance in indicated cell); and dashed arrow – containing 
all assayed segments. The scale bar represents 10 µm.

 Figure 5. 
GCXV belongs to an insect-specific clade within the segmented Jingmenviruses. Maximum-
likelihood (ML) trees are shown with bootstrap support values from both the ML and 
neighbor-joining (NJ) trees: ML/NJ. Scale indicates number of amino acid changes per site.
