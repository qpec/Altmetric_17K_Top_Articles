SUMMARY
Background
Traditionally, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are conceptu-
alised as originating in the brain via stress pathways (brain-to-gut). It is
uncertain how many with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and functional
dyspepsia (FD) have a gut origin of symptoms (gut-to-brain pathway).
Aims
To determine if there is a distinct brain-to-gut FGID (where psychological
symptoms begin first) and separately a distinct gut-to-brain FGID (where
gut symptoms start first).
Methods
A prospective random population sample from Newcastle, Australia who
responded to a validated survey in 2012 and completed a 1-year follow-up
survey (n = 1900). The surveys contained questions on Rome III IBS and
FD and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.
Results
We found that higher levels of anxiety and depression at baseline were signifi-
cant predictors of developing IBS (OR = 1.31; 95% CI 1.06–1.61, P = 0.01;
OR = 1.54; 95% CI 1.29–1.83, P < 0.001) and FD (OR = 1.28; 95% CI 1.05–
1.55, P = 0.01; OR = 1.55, 95% CI 1.32–1.83, P < 0.001), respectively, at the
1-year follow-up. Among those people who did not have elevated levels of
anxiety and depression at baseline, subjects at baseline with documented IBS
(mean difference 0.34; 95% CI 0.13–0.55, P = 0.002; 0.81; 95% CI 0.47–1.15,
P < 0.001) and FD (0.38; 95% CI 0.14–0.63, P = 0.002; 0.92; 95% CI 0.57–
1.27, P < 0.001), reported significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression
at the 1-year follow-up. We calculated in one-third of individuals a mood dis-
order precedes FGID but in two-thirds an FGID precedes the mood disorder.
Conclusion
While brain–gut pathways are bidirectional, a major subset begin with gut symp-
toms first and only then psychological distress develops, implicating primary gut
mechanisms as drivers of the gut and extra-intestinal features in many cases.

 BACKGROUND
The irritable bowel syndrome
(IBS) and
functional
dyspepsia (FD) are two of the most prevalent functional
gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs).1 While by definition
FGIDs are characterised by GI symptoms that are not
explained by known structural or organic abnormalities,2
there has been a recent shift in the conceptualisation of
these disorders as potentially disorders of the brain–gut
axis.3, 4
The brain–gut axis refers to the biochemical signalling
taking place between the gastrointestinal tract and the
central nervous system, and this linkage may be a key in
the pathogenesis of the FGIDs.4 Brain-to-gut pathways
are considered to be primarily involved in these condi-
tions based on several sources of evidence, including epi-
demiological studies showing that psychological factors
are independent risk factors for meeting criteria for a
FGID,5–8
psychological
treatment
studies
that
show
symptom improvement with psychological therapy is
superior to wait listing9, 10 and evidence from patho-
physiological and animal studies.11–13 However, more
recent evidence is emerging that dominant gut-to-brain
pathways may also operate in a major subset of these
disorders.3, 14–18
Some of the first direct evidence in humans that the
brain–gut relationship in FGIDs may be bidirectional has
come
from
epidemiological
studies.
Koloski
et al.
prospectively followed up 1002 cases and controls ran-
domly selected from the Australian electoral roll with a
postal survey 12 years after they first participated in the
study.3 FGIDs were defined using the Rome II criteria
and psychological distress was assessed using the Delu-
sions Symptom State Inventory at baseline and follow-
up. They showed that among people free of a FGID at
baseline, higher levels of anxiety but not depression at
baseline was a significant independent predictor of devel-
oping new onset FGIDs 12 years later. Among those
who did not have elevated levels of anxiety and depres-
sion at baseline, individuals with a FGID at baseline had
significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression at
follow-up. Further validation of these findings, however,
is yet to be published in full.
Animal studies in mice further support gut-to-brain sig-
nalling through the microbiome that can modulate anxi-
ety.19 In patients with IBS, significantly higher baseline
cytokine levels have been observed compared with healthy
controls including tumour necrosis factor alpha, IL-1beta
and
IL-6.15
Furthermore,
lipopolysaccharide-induced
tumour necrosis factor alpha production significantly
correlated with anxiety in IBS (r value of 0.59)15; higher cir-
culating tumour necrosis factor alpha levels have also been
reported in FD.16 These data suggest low grade gut inflam-
mation in IBS and FD (e.g. via mast cell or eosinophil infil-
tration) with cytokine release may at least in a subset
directly induce the observed psychological comorbidity so
deeply characteristic of the syndromes.20–22
While studies provide support for a bidirectional brain–
gut relationship in FGIDs, the concept of a distinct gut-to-
brain syndrome, potentially implying the need for a differ-
ent treatment algorithm compared to those with brain-to-
gut dysfunction, remains controversial. Furthermore, no
studies have confirmed these findings using a shorter time
frame or with the most recent Rome III criteria, or with
alternative measures of psychosocial distress. Therefore, we
aimed to extend the findings from previous research applying
a shorter time frame. We conducted a 1-year prospective fol-
low-up study of Rome III defined FGIDs including IBS and
FD using a valid psychological questionnaire designed specif-
ically for people with physical problems. We hypothesised
there is a specific gut-to-brain syndrome, where GI symp-
toms precede the onset of psychological distress in about half
of all those who eventually suffer with an FGID.
METHODS
Participants
Participants (n = 2885) were a random population sample
from Newcastle and Hunter New England, Australia who
responded to a validated survey in 2012 and agreed to be
contacted for future research. Of these, n = 1900 com-
pleted
the
1-year
follow-up
survey
(response
rate = 67.6%).
Measures
The original and 1 year follow-up survey contained the
follow measures
• Modified Rome III Questionnaire.23 This is a self-
report instrument that measures functional gastroin-
testinal
symptoms
experienced
over
the
prior
3 months. Previous testing has shown this instrument
to be reliable and valid. This measure was used to
diagnose IBS and FD.
• Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale was used to
assess psychological distress.24 The questionnaire con-
tains 14 items that assess anxiety (seven items) and
depression (seven items). Each item is rated on a
four-point scale ranging from 0 to 3, such that each
2

 sub-scale has a maximum score of 21. Higher scores
on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale indicate
depression or anxiety in a patient. A score of >11 of
21 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale
domains was used to indicate elevated levels of anxiety
and depression, respectively.24
• SF-12 was used to assess health-related quality-of-life.25
This is a 12-item generic quality-of-life measure assessing
mental and physical functioning over the past 4 weeks.
Examples of questions assessing mental functioning
included ‘Have you felt calm and peaceful?’ and ‘Have
you felt down hearted and blue?’ Physical functioning
was addressed with questions such as ‘During the past
4 weeks, how much did pain interfere with your normal
work (including both work outside the home and house-
work)?
We also recorded demographics age, gender and edu-
cational level attained (<high school, high school, >high
school).
Rome III Definitions2
Irritable
Bowel
Syndrome. Symptoms
of
recurrent
abdominal pain or discomfort and a change in bowel
habit, with symptoms experienced on at least 2-3 days in
the last 3 months. Two or more of the following must
occur at least sometimes (>25% of the time):
• Pain is relieved by a bowel movement
• Onset of pain is related to a change in frequency of
stool
• Onset of pain is related to a change in the appearance
of stool.
Constipation predominant IBS was defined by the pre-
sence of hard but not loose stools.
Diarrhea predominant IBS was defined by the pre-
sence of loose but not hard stools.
Functional dyspepsia. The presence of
one or more of
the following symptoms at least 1 day a week in the last
3 months.
• Post-prandial fullness
• Early satiation
• Epigastric pain
• Epigastric burning
Epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) was defined by the
presence of epigastric pain and/or burning. Post-prandial
distress syndrome (PDS) was defined by the presence of
post-prandial fullness and/or early satiation.
Procedures: The study was approved by the Hunter New
England Human Ethics Committee. Participants who had
indicated in the original survey that they did not object to
being contacted for future research were sent the 1-year
follow-up survey. Participants in the follow-up study were
sent a participant information sheet outlining the study,
the survey and a reply paid envelope. We used the Dill-
man Total Design Method26 for the follow-up of nonre-
sponders. The follow-up protocol included a reminder/
thank you letter sent to all participants at week 1, a
replacement survey sent out to nonresponders at week 4
and a reminder/thank you letter sent at week 5 to those
nonresponders identified at week 4. Additional measures
to maximise response rates included a personalised cover-
ing letter personally signed by the chief investigator, an
easy to understand attractive coloured questionnaire
booklet, and postage stamps on envelopes. Participants
did not receive any remuneration for their participation.
Statistical analyses
The sample is described with respect to baseline preva-
lence of IBS and FD including 95% confidence intervals
and with respect to disappearance and onset of IBS and
FD between baseline and follow-up (Table 1).
The formal statistical analysis sought to understand
the bidirectional relationship between change in gut
symptoms (IBS and FD) and changes in mood and qual-
ity-of-life (QoL). This was approached in two ways. The
first evaluated brain–gut and gut–brain longitudinal pre-
dictions. In individuals who were stratified as free of IBS

Independent gut–brain and brain–gut pathways in IBS
 or meeting IBS criteria at baseline anxiety and depres-
sion scores were separately used to predict IBS status at
1-year follow-up using unconditional logistic regression.
Since both anxiety and depression scales are reported on
arbitrary numeric scales where a single point change is
not considered clinically significant, interpretation of the
odds ratios for baseline anxiety and depression predict-
ing follow-up IBS status was facilitated by dividing the
raw scores by their standard deviation. This results in a
one point change corresponding to a one standard devia-
tion change which is large in relative terms. While there
is no independent definition of ‘large’ or ‘small’, clinical
trials are often powered for the equivalent of 0.5 or even
0.3 standard deviations. Another point of calibration is
that in terms of degree of discrimination between
groups, a standard deviation of 1.0 would correspond to
an area under the receiver–operator characteristic curve
of 0.77, which represents discrimination clearly above
clinical ‘noise’. This was repeated for FD and represents
a brain-to-gut relationship. These results are reported in
Table 2. Subsequently, in individuals stratified as normal
or elevated on anxiety at baseline, IBS and FD status
were separately used to predict anxiety score using linear
regression. Due to non-Normal distribution of residuals
formal statistical inference has been based on the non-
parametric bootstrap using 2000 replications. This was
repeated for depression. A score of >11 of 21 on the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale domains was
used to indicate elevated levels of anxiety and depression
respectively. These results are reported in Table 3 and
represent a gut–brain relationship. The second approach
classified individuals into four categories representing
their change in FD status (Table S1) and change in IBS
status
(Table
S2)
and
described
the
corresponding
change in anxiety, depression and QoL.
An analysis to determine the order of the natural his-
tory of FGIDs (IBS or FD) and mood disorders (anxiety
or depression) was also undertaken in the subset of indi-
viduals for whom in the order of appearance during the
course of the study could be ascertained. Individuals
who qualified for an FGID or a mood disorder (but not
both or neither) and who subsequently developed the
other condition were considered. Individuals who quali-
fied for a mood disorder at baseline and an FGID at fol-
low-up were considered brain-to-gut, while those who
qualified for an FGID at baseline and a mood disorder
at follow-up were considered a gut-to-brain direction.
RESULTS
Response rate
In the original survey, a total 3260 people returned a
completed survey of 8981. The denominator was reduced
by 13 people who had died and 466 return to senders.
Responders were significantly more likely to be aged over
45 years
compared
with
nonresponders
(68.3%
vs.
40.5%, P < 0.001). Responders were also more likely to
be female vs. nonresponders; although this was statisti-
cally significant, it was numerically very small due to the
study power (53.4% vs. 48.0%, P < 0.001). There were
no statistically significant differences between responders
and nonresponders with respect to socioeconomic status
with the SIEFA Advantage–Disadvantage scores being
similar for responders vs. for nonresponders (M = 965.8
vs. M = 965.5, P = 0.89). Hence, the only trait on which
responders and nonresponders differ by an amount large
enough to have a practical consequence is age and the
response bias is actually towards the older age group,
which is likely to bias towards the null if at all and so
does not limit the generalisability of our findings.
For the 1-year follow-up, we mailed out the survey to
2885 people who had responded to the original survey
and had also agreed to being recontacted for future
research. The denominator was reduced by 69 returns to

 senders and five people who had died. A total of 1900
completed surveys were returned and used in the analy-
ses, giving a response rate of 67.6%.
Sample characteristics
Among the 1900 individuals with responses at both base-
line and follow-up, the mean age was 57 (s.d. = 14),
53% (n = 1010) were female and the mean body mass
index was 28 (s.d. = 6).
Incidence and disappearance of FGID, IBS and
functional dyspepsia
We found 6.4% developed new onset IBS, with about 2%
developing new onset IBS-C and IBS-D. Slightly more
people developed FD (7.2%) with the new onset of FD-
PDS more common than FD-EPS (Table 1). Almost half
of those people with IBS and FD at baseline lost their
symptoms at the 1-year follow-up (Table 1).
FGID brain-to-gut pathways
Among those people free of IBS and FD at baseline, we
found higher levels of anxiety and depression were sig-
nificant predictors of developing IBS and FD at a 1-year
follow-up (Table 2), implicating brain–gut interactions in
these disorders, but not among those who already had
IBS or FD.
FGID gut-to-brain pathways
Among those people who did not have elevated levels of
anxiety and depression at baseline, people with docu-
mented IBS and FD at baseline reported significantly
higher levels of anxiety and depression at the 1-year fol-
low-up (Table 3), but not among those who already had
elevated anxiety or depression, implicating primary gut-
to-brain pathways operate in a major subset with these
disorders.
Association between change from baseline to follow-
up for mood and quality-of-life scores vs. change in
FGID status
We also examined change from baseline to follow-up for
mood and quality-of-life scores vs. change in IBS and
FD status. We only found a change in mental function-
ing was significantly associated with developing FD at
follow-up compared with people who did not have FD
at baseline or follow-up (P = 0.01, see Table S1). In IBS,
we found that a change in physical functioning was sig-
nificantly associated with those people who developed
IBS at follow-up vs. those who continued to have IBS
from baseline to follow-up (P = 0.04, see Table S2).
Proportions of brain-to-gut and gut-to-brain
For this purpose, we consider only those who (i) met cri-
teria for a mood disorder at baseline (but not an FGID)
and who then reported a mood disorder 1 year later or
(ii) who met criteria for an FGID at baseline (but not a
mood disorder) and who then reported an FGID 1 year
later. Of 215 individuals with mood disorder at baseline
30 met criteria for FGID 1 year later and of 309 individ-
uals with an FGID at baseline 60 met criteria for a mood
disorder 1 year later. Hence, it is only in the 90 (30 plus
60) individuals who meet criteria (i) or (ii) above in
whom the order of incidence in this study could be
determined, yielding 1/3 of individuals in whom mood
disorder precedes FGID and 2/3 in whom FGID pre-
cedes a mood disorder.
DISCUSSION
This study provides strong direct evidence that the gut
and brain interact bidirectionally in both IBS and FD.
While brain-to-gut pathways were evident in IBS and
FD as expected, the data from this study also suggest
that many people with IBS and FD have their disorder

Independent gut–brain and brain–gut pathways in IBS
 begin in the gut, and the gut likely drives psychological
alterations in a major group of cases with FGIDs. This
study independently confirms previous population-based
research3, 18 but applied a shorter timescale (1 year
rather than up to 12 years), applied recent FGID diag-
nostic criteria2 and tested alternative validated measures
of psychological distress in a population setting.
The brain–gut axis is becoming increasingly recog-
nised as critically important in the pathophysiology of
IBS and FD, with regional central nervous system alter-
ations in IBS and FD documented with functional MRI
or PET scanning studies.27, 28
We confirm previous cross-sectional and longitudinal
findings3, 18 that brain-to-gut pathways operate in a subset
of people with IBS and FD. We found among those people
free of IBS and FD at baseline, higher levels of anxiety and
depression were significant predictors of developing IBS
and FD, but not among those who already had IBS or FD.
This is in line with our earlier 12-year prospective study,
where we found higher levels of anxiety and depression at
baseline were predictive of developing IBS at the 12-year
follow-up among people free of IBS at baseline, although
only higher levels of depression but not anxiety at baseline
were predictive of developing FD at the 12-year follow-up
among people free of FD at baseline.3 Our results also con-
firm a UK GP database study of 5 years of data, where two-
thirds of patients with an FGID had a psychological diagno-
sis first.18
We also examined whether a change in psychological
distress and quality-of-life was associated with develop-
ing FGIDs at follow-up. While we found higher change
scores in anxiety and depression as well as mental and
physical functioning among people who developed, lost
or continued to have IBS and FD over the 1-year time
frame compared with those who remained IBS or FD
free, only worse mental functioning was significantly
associated with developing FD at follow-up compared
with people who did not have FD at baseline or follow-
up. In terms of IBS, only poorer physical functioning
was significantly associated with developing IBS at fol-
low-up compared with people who continued to have
IBS at baseline and follow-up. Our data are consistent
with
one
trial
showing
improving
physical
activity
reduced IBS symptoms.29
These data highlight the importance of the brain–gut
axis in people with IBS and FD. Anxiety and depression
may affect the gut in several ways including increasing
sympathetic and decreasing parasympathetic tone in
the
autonomic
nervous
system,
up
regulating
the
hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal
(HPA)
axis
including
corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF) and cortisol,30 as
well as through promoting abnormally increased vigi-
lance for gastrointestinal symptoms via the efferent
neuro-endocrine loop.31, 32 Understanding more about
these mechanisms will likely assist in the development of
more effective diagnostic and treatment strategies for
people with a clear cut brain–gut disorder.
While the brain–gut axis is thought to account for a sig-
nificant proportion of people with IBS and FD, our findings
suggest that there is also a subset of people with IBS and FD
that have a gut-to-brain disorder.18 In this study, there were
90 individuals who had either an FGID or mood disorder
at baseline and who developed the other at follow-up, of
whom 1/3 followed the brain–gut pathway and 2/3 the gut–
brain pathway. The exact proportions in each pathway,
however, do need to be interpreted with caution as we
could only ascertain order in a relatively small proportion
of the sample. In any case, the evidence suggests that
between one-third and two-thirds with an FGID may have
a primary gut driven syndrome with the brain secondarily
involved. A large UK GP database study recorded both
FGID and a mood diagnoses at several time points over the
course of 5 years; in the UK GP database around two-
thirds had a psychological diagnosis first, vs. one-third hav-
ing a FGID diagnosis first.18
The fact that in this study, we did not observe signifi-
cantly higher levels of psychological distress at follow-up
among those people with IBS and FD who already had
elevated anxiety or depression at baseline is further
supportive evidence of a true gut-to-brain pathway.
A new model of a microbe-gene-inflammation interac-
tion, where infection can lead to excessive tumour necrosis
factor alpha and other cytokine production in vulnerable
individuals is beginning to emerge and may in part explain
this gut–brain interaction.33 The activation of the immune
system has frequently been observed in patients with IBS
compared with controls.34 Tumour necrosis factor alpha
levels have been shown to correlate with anxiety in IBS,
but more data are needed.16 Animal studies of gut bacteria
have also shown the bacteria can influence changes in
behaviour.35–38 Alterations of the gut microbiome have
been shown in IBS although an exact signature is lack-
ing.39 One study found that in patients with post infec-
tious IBS the intestinal microbiota differed from other IBS
patients and healthy controls and the microbial composi-
tion was significantly associated with the Hospital Anxiety
and Depression Scale score.40 Other hypothesised path-
ways of gut–brain communication include direct secretion
of neuroactive chemicals in the gut by bacteria such as
fatty acids, GABA and 5-HT precursors and stimulation of
6

N. A. Koloski et al.
 secretion of 5-HT from enteroendocrine cells.41 The effi-
cacy of the non-absorbable antibiotic rifaximin in IBS in
about a third of cases is consistent42 with the hypothesis
the gut microbiome modulates the syndrome in a subset
but not all patients.43 A review of pre-clinical studies in
patients with Traveller’s diarrhoea showed that rifaximin
may affect the intestinal mucosa by inhibiting bacterial
attachment and internalisation, thereby reducing inflam-
mation.44 Further research is needed into gut–brain path-
ways
and
how
these
may
be
translated
into
the
development of more effective management strategies
for people with a gut–brain disorder. We speculate
although phenotypically identical, those whose FGID
symptoms that arise primarily from gut pathways will not
respond well to psychological therapy, but will respond to
gut directed therapies that reverse key abnormalities such
as an abnormal microbiome or possibly T-cell dysregula-
tion.45 This may help explain the heterogeneity of
response in IBS and FD to pharmacological interven-
tions.46
This study confirms long-term findings that the brain
and gut interact bidirectionally in FGIDs using a much
shorter time frame of 1 year. While we did not assess
for potential confounders such as changes in medication,
life stressors or other nongastrointestinal related condi-
tions, the data from a short-time frame are less likely to
be influenced by such confounders. However, these
results do need to be interpreted with caution as FGIDs
are not all stable over time and fluctuations occurred
during this 1-year time period although this did not
interfere with observing statistically significant findings
of moderate effect size. Aside from the short-time frame,
these data also confirm bidirectional brain-gut pathways
in FGIDs defined using the more recent Rome III criteria
suggesting that these results are not specific to how IBS
and FD are diagnosed. In addition, we also confirmed
these findings using a different measure of psychological
distress. In contrast to our earlier study, we used the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The scale was
developed as a screening instrument for use in hospital
out-patient departments, but has subsequently been vali-
dated for use with the general population.47, 48 The
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale unlike many
other psychological measures does not contain questions
that could be attributed to physical illness, such as head-
ache or dizziness which are often extra-intestinal symp-
toms reported by people with IBS and FD. We achieved
an acceptable response rate and did not detect any major
selection biases.
In conclusion, this study provides further strong evi-
dence that the gut and brain interact bidirectionally in
IBS and FD and extends past work to a shorter time-
scale. The data also confirm that there is a subset with
FD and IBS that have their disorder begin in the gut and
the gut may primarily drive psychological alterations in
some with FGIDs.
