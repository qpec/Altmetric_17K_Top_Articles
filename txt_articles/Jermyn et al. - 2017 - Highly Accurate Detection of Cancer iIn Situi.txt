Abstract
Effectiveness of surgery as a cancer treatment is reduced when
all cancer cells are not detected during surgery, leading to
recurrences that negatively impact survival. To maximize cancer
cell detection during cancer surgery, we designed an in situ
intraoperative, label-free, optical cancer detection system that
combines intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, diffuse reflec-
tance spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy. Using this mul-
timodal optical cancer detection system, we found that brain,
lung, colon, and skin cancers could be detected in situ during
surgery with an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 97%,
100%, and 93%, respectively. This highly sensitive optical
molecular imaging approach can profoundly impact a wide
range of surgical and noninvasive interventional oncology
procedures by improving cancer detection capabilities, thereby
reducing cancer burden and improving survival and quality of
life. Cancer Res; 77(14); 3942–50. �2017 AACR.
Introduction
Treatment of solid cancers includes combinations of surgery,
radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. In this scheme, surgery is a
means to access tissue for diagnosis and is a cancer treatment via
cytoreduction. Many studies have shown dramatic survival advan-
tages by surgically minimizing the volume of cancers, including
melanoma (1), brain (2), breast (3), and lung cancers (4).
Otherwise, precancerous, cancerous, or normal tissue invaded by
cancer cells remain (5–7). When these residual cells are not
eradicated by adjuvant treatments, they give rise to recurrences.
The volume of residual cancer following surgery negatively
impacts overall survival (4, 8–12).
In situ cancer detection remains a clinical challenge because the
interface between the cancer and normal tissue can be difficult to
visually discern, or cancer cell invasion into normal tissue elim-
inates any interface. A striking and well-established example is the
common metastases to brain that develop in lung cancer and
melanoma patients. These cancers appear to have a clear interface
with the brain during surgery, and thus, an apparent complete
resection is often achieved. Yet, even when postoperative MRIs
suggest that no cancer remains, these cancers almost always recur
at that exact surgical margin unless adjuvant radiotherapy is
delivered. There is thus an unmet clinical need in oncology for
practical, innovative technologies that can make cancers "visible"
in situ and in real-time so as to minimally disrupt workflow.
One strategy to make cancer visible is by using fluorescence-
based approaches. In these, exogenous agents targeting oncogenic
processes are delivered with the aims of selective uptake in all
cancer cells and the detection of these agents during surgery. To
date, the only fluorescence agents that have been used in human
studies are indocyanine green, fluorescein, and 5-aminolevulinic
acid during brain cancer surgery (13). Each of these, however, is
limited by insufficient sensitivity and variable uptake as a result of
the genomic and molecular heterogeneity of cancers.
Another strategy to detect cancer within tissues is to use optics-
based label-free tissue interrogation techniques, such as optical
coherence tomography (OCT), Raman spectroscopy (RS), intrin-
sic fluorescence spectroscopy (IFS), and diffuse reflectance spec-
troscopy (DRS). OCT provides microscopic structural imaging. It
has been used to detect brain cancer based on optical attenuation
(14). RS provides vibrational molecular information based on
inelastic light scattering from molecular species, including amino
acids, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acid. It has been used in a
variety of surgical oncology applications by exploiting the differ-
ences between spectroscopic molecular information inherent in
normal tissues and cancers such as breast cancer (15), bladder
cancer (16), brain cancer (7), precancerous cervical lesions (17),
and gastrointestinal cancer during endoscopy (18). IFS detects
endogenous fluorophores, including enzymes, metabolic cofac-
tors, amino acids, porphyrins, and structural proteins. IFS has
been used to detect bronchopulmonary cancer (19), epithelial

 precancerous tissue (20), laryngeal cancer (21), and breast cancer
(22). DRS provides information from tissue absorbers, including
oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, lipids, water, cyto-
chromes, and melanin (23–25). DRS has been used to detect
cervical cancer (26), melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers
(27), breast cancer (28), and colorectal metastases to liver (29).
In vivo RS has been shown to be a highly specific and sensitive
cancer detection method for multiple pathologies with detec-
tion accuracy values usually limited to approximately 90%
(7, 15–17, 30), while oncology applications using IFS and/or
DRShavebeensimilarlylimited(26,28,29,31).Wehypothesized
that IFS and DRS have the potential to synergistically complement
the molecular information provided by RS to maximize cancer
detection capability. To test this hypothesis, we developed an
integrated cancer detection system that combines IFS, DRS, and
RS. This system exploits inherent nonredundant biological mar-
kers, such as molecular species with specific fluorescence, absorp-
tion, and molecular vibrational signatures (23–25). To optimize
the diagnostic potential of these subtle spectrally distributed
differences in the combined spectroscopic data from all three
methods, a hierarchical supervised machine learning algorithm
was developed for multivariate analysis to evaluate the ability to
distinguish normal tissue from cancer using the spectral data. We
then tested the capabilities of this system in situ during surgery and
show that it achieves high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.
Materials and Methods
System setup: RS, IFS, and DRS
The new surgical probe shown in Fig. 1 allows sequential
acquisition of spectra associated with RS, IFS for two excitation
wavelengths, and DRS following excitation with a broadband
white-light source. All hardware components (light sources, filter
wheel, and detectors) are controlled using a custom LabView
(National Instruments) program. The hand-held probe allows RS,
IFS, and DRS tissue interrogation. The fiber-optic probe (Emvi-
sion, LLC) is connected to the illumination and detection sub-
assembly by a 3-m long fiberoptic cable and has a 2.1-mm outer
diameter. Nine low hydroxyl content 300-mm core silica fibers are
distributed around a central 272-mm core silica fiber used for RS
tissue excitation at 785 nm. Of the nine circularly distributed
fibers, seven are used for collecting RS scattered light. The ree-
mitted signal passes through a ring-shaped notch filter to remove
elastically scattered laser light. Furthermore, to minimize the
impact of the Raman signal from the optical fibers, an in-line
short-pass emission filter is used in front of the excitation fiber.
Two of the nine outer fibers are used for IFS and DRS. A custom
two-component lens is used at the tip of the probe to ensure
excitation, and detection areas for all fibers exactly overlap, thus
making RS, IFS, and DRS measurements spatially colocated with a
0.5-mm interrogation area. The seven RS fibers combine into a
single optical connector to maximize signal-to-noise ratio, while
the IFS/DRS fibers are associated with two connectors: one for
excitation and one for detection.
The detection connector for RS is connected to a spectrograph
composed of a diffraction grating combined with a high-resolu-
tion charge-coupled device (CCD) camera (ANDOR Technology).
A 1 W, 785 nm spectrum stabilized near-infrared laser (Innovative
Photonic Solutions) with adjustable power is used for RS excita-
tion. Two light-emitting diodes (LED) of different wavelengths
(365 and 455 nm) are used for IFS, and a 3 W broadband LED
(470–850 nm) is used for DRS (Thorlabs, Inc.). Prior to entering
the probe excitation fiber, the IFS light sources are filtered using a
low-pass filter to minimize potential excitation light bleed-
through into the detection fiber. A stepper motor optical switch
(DiCon Fiberoptics, Inc.) allows sequential tissue excitation with
the IFS wavelengths and the DRS source. IFS and DRS detection is

 achieved using a compact spectrometer (Ocean Optics Inc.). A
five-slot motorized filter wheel has been placed in the light path
between the spectrometer and the IFS/DRS detection fiber of the
probe. A long pass filter is used for the IFS channels selected to
limit the amount of excitation light reaching the spectrometer.
The sequential acquisition of each modality (RS, IFS, and DRS) is
synchronized using the custom LabView program.
Intraoperative validation during brain tumor resection
This study investigated the use of RS, DRS, and IFS in a
combined system using a handheld probe for intraoperative use
on 15 adult patients undergoing open cranium surgery at the
Montreal
Neurological
Institute
and
Hospital
(Montreal,
Canada). Patients with metastatic cancers and patients with grade
2–4 gliomas were selected. The study was approved by the
Montreal Neurological Institute Ethics Review Board, and
informed consent was obtained from all subjects. The methods
were carried out in accordance with the approved guidelines and
regulations. Standard clinical imaging by MRI was followed, as
well as a complete preoperative neurologic examination.
During the study, the system was placed on a surgical cart and
brought in the operating room (OR). It was then connected with
the sterilized probe situated in the OR sterile zone. LabView
program operation was performed by a member of the research
group and the neurosurgeon operated the probe, blinded to any
information relating to the acquired spectra during the resection
procedure. An imaging sequence comprises background acquisi-
tion for RS, DRS, and IFS (system light sources turned off) and RS,
DRS, and IFS acquisitions of tissue. Acquisitions on calibration
standards were performed at the end of surgery to ensure nor-
malization of the spectra can be achieved to remove contributions
from the system response function. The neurosurgeon gave an
assessment about the tissue imaged for each sample, based on
tissue appearance through the surgical microscope and navigation
guidance data, and collected a small biopsy sample (�3.5 mm3)
at the exact same position. Those samples were then embedded in
paraffin and sent to histopathology for a standard blinded anal-
ysis using hematoxylin and eosin stain, performed by an expert
neuropathologist. Using standard clinical practice, atypical cells
were identified on the basis of their morphologic features, includ-
ing nuclear atypia and nuclear polymorphism. Each sample was
classified as either normal brain (no cancer cells present) or
cancer. For analysis, all patients with grade 2–4 gliomas were
pooled together, and all patients with metastatic cancers (lung,
melanoma, and colon) were pooled together.
For each spectral acquisition, the microscope light was turned
off temporarily. A Medtronic neuronavigation system (Stealth-
Station) was used to locate the three-dimensional position of the
probe relative to the preoperative MR images. This system uses
small near-infrared (NIR) reflecting balls that are attached to the
probe (SureTrack system, Medtronic) and an NIR light source.
This source needs to be pointed away when the acquisition is
made for RS because of the artifact it can create in the Raman
spectra (32). Acquisition samples were rejected in the study if light
artifacts were present in the signal, if CCD saturation was reached
during the acquisition, orif the biopsy sample was partitioned (no
homogeneity in the nature of the tissue).
Standard measurement time for the combined system is
approximately 8 seconds. It includes one background acquisition
for RS (integration time of 50 ms) and the three RS acquisitions
(3 � 50 ms) that are averaged together for the analysis, plus the
three background acquisitions (3 � 800 ms) and three acquisi-
tions (3 � 800 ms) needed for DRS and IFS (one for each of the
three light sources). Additional time is needed for the optical
switch to go from one fiber to the other, for the filter wheel to
move accordingly to the light source imaging at the time, and for
the automated control via the LabView program. The output
power at the end of the probe was measured using a powermeter,
reporting 14.0 mW for the 455 nm source, 46.5 mW for the 365 nm
source, and 0.5 mW for the white source. The output power for RS
is typically 48 mW at the tip of the probe, but may vary between 27
and 75 mW to maximize the signal amplitude and avoid
saturation.
Data analysis and tissue classification
Data preprocessing and calibration for IFS and DRS are
described in detail in the Supplementary Methods. After these
preprocessing steps, each IFS spectrum is normalized by the mean
of the corresponding DRS spectrum, to correct for the effects of
optical attenuation in tissue. Processing for RS involves back-
ground subtraction, correction by instrument response using
measurements of a SRM2241 reference standard (National Insti-
tute of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD), the remov-
al of intrinsic tissue fluorescence using an iterative polynomial fit
(7), and standard normal variate normalization. Supervised
machine learning methods can be used to distinguish different
tissue types based on spectral characteristics, and a number of
different methods have been used in previous studies such as
support vector machines and linear discriminant analysis
(33, 34). We previously demonstrated the efficacy of boosted
trees for the classification of tissue based on Raman spectra (7),
which operates by constructing an ensemble of decision trees that
use differences in spectral information to distinguish different
tissue types. This method was used here for RS tissue classification.
For IFS, support vector machines were used for tissue classifica-
tion, with feature selection based on the minimum redundancy
maximum relevance (mRMR) method (35) to reduce the
dimensionality of the spectra while retaining the most important
information. When faced with multiple types of spectral infor-
mation (here, RS and IFS), classifiers can be combined using
hierarchical or sequential classification (36). In this case, we have
employed hierarchical classification by using a classifier individ-
ually on the spectra from each of three datasets (RS, IFS – 365 nm,
IFS – 455 nm), then combining the predictive information
(posterior probabilities) from each classifier into a final support
vector machines classifier. This allows us to use the multispectro-
scopy information to improve diagnostic capability. Leave-one-
patient-out cross-validation (LOPO CV) was used to determine
the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity for the classification of RS
alone, as well as for RS and IFS combined. LOPO CV treats all
spectra from a single patient as the testing data, with spectra from
all other patients as training data for the classifier. This process is
repeated for each patient. This avoids potential bias caused by
potential similarity of spectra from a single patient. Classification
parameters such as the number of features used for mRMR and the
number of decision trees for boosted trees were determined using
cross-validation to achieve high sensitivity/specificity while
avoiding overfitting to the data. In this study, all grades of gliomas
were pooled, rather than classifying each grade individually.
Sample size was chosen to achieve two-sided 95% normal-based
confidence intervals of less than �5% for each of the classification
results
reported.

Results
Cancer detection system design
The integrated optical cancer detection system was designed by
combining IFS, DRS, and RS capabilities into a single hand-held
probe coupled to a detection system (Fig. 1). The probe contains
embedded fibreoptics for excitation and detection: one fiber for
RS excitation; seven fibers for RS detection; one fiber for DRS/IFS
excitation; and one fiber for DRS/IFS detection. A custom lens and
filters are used to isolate the desired signals. The probe is con-
nected to stimulating lasers, a CCD camera, and a spectrometer.
All three modalities interrogate the same 500-mm diameter tissue
region. Each in situ tissue interrogation requires a measurement
time of approximately 8 seconds: 200 ms for RS; 2.4 seconds for
DRS; and 2.4 seconds for each of the two IFS excitation bands.
Clinical testing design
We tested the performance of this system in a clinical study of
patients harboring a variety of cancers, including primary brain
cancers (gliomas), lung and colon cancers that had metastasized
to brain, and melanoma that had metastasized to brain. During
surgery, the probe was applied to normal and pathologic tissue
regions and measurements were acquired for RS, DRS, and IFS.
Ten to 15 sites were interrogated in each of the 15 patients
included in the study for a total of 161 sites. Tissue was sampled
at each site for blinded postinterrogation neuropathologic
analysis to determine whether cancer cells were present in the
interrogated region (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Fig. S1A). We then
correlated these data with the corresponding processed spectral
data (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Fig. S1B).
Tissue and spectral acquisitions
Neuropathologic analysis revealed that 69 of the trimodal
measurements were acquired from normal brain, and 92 mea-
surements were acquired from cancers or normal brain invaded by
cancer cells (Table 1; Fig. 2A). RS, DRS, and IFS spectra for
interrogation sites that contain dense cancer, normal brain invad-
ed by cancer cells, and normal brain from a patient with a glioma
are shown in Fig. 2B. For each tissue interrogation region, the
spectroscopic information consisted of three spectra, totaling
more than 1,600 spectral bands. The mean spectra for normal
and cancer tissue for the entire cohort and for each modality (RS,
IFS, and DRS) are shown in Fig. 3. The Raman spectra reveal
molecular differences between normal and cancer tissue at the
indicated peaks, associated with proteins, lipids, cholesterol, and
nucleic acids. IFS spectra reveal subtle spectral distortions between
tissues.
Cancer detection system performance
RS peaks were identified for lipids, nucleic acids, and choles-
terol, as well as the three amide bands associated with the
secondary structure of proteins (33, 37–43). The most significant
biochemical differences between cancer and normal tissue were
found, based on univariate statistical hypothesis testing of the
individual RS peaks and tissue bands, as either increases (þ) or
decreases (�) in cancer. (Supplementary Table S1; Supplementary

RNA content were found to be higher for cancer, likely related
to increased chromatin density (44, 45). Phospholipids and
lipids, the main constituents of cell membranes and intracellular
organelles, were more abundant in cancers because of the higher
cell density in cancers compared with normal tissues. Amino acid,
amide, and protein concentrations were also different, suggesting
modifications in cellular functions such as metabolism (46), cell

 migration (47), and neurotransmitter expression [phenylalanine
(�), tryptophan (þ/�), tyrosine (�), valine (�); ref. 48]. The
expression of extracellular matrix components, such as proline
(�), collagen (�), and elastin (�), was less in cancers (49).
The information associated with average IFS and DRS spectra is
not as molecularly specific as RS because of the different physical
origin of the light–tissue interaction processes leading to spectra
with much less characteristic features. The spectra obtained for IFS
and DRS conform to expectations and previous literature (26, 28,
29), as can be assessed on the basis of the shape of the intrinsic
fluorescence spectra and the presence of characteristic hemoglo-
bin peaks in the diffuse reflectance measurements (Fig. 3).
Spectra contain many features: peaks in the spectra; individual
spectral points; or broader spectral shapes. To characterize the
diagnostic potential of all spectra and individual features com-
bined, multivariate statistical analysis was performed to automat-
ically classify samples using a discriminative classifier given
labeled training data based on a LOPO CV approach (see Materi-
als and Methods). The classification results are reported using
parametric ROC curves from which diagnostic accuracy figures
can be derived. These are based on selecting the threshold
parametric values providing optimal balance between sensitivity
and specificity. ROC curves associated with tissue classification
using RS or RS and IFS comparing normal brain and gliomas (Fig.
4A), normal brain and metastases (Fig. 4B), and normal brain
with all cancers combined (Fig. 4C) show that in all instances the
AUC is larger than or equal to 0.95. The AUC for RS and IFS
combined is 0.98 for glioma detection and 0.99 for either the
metastases or all cancers combined categories. The synergistic
contribution of IFS to RS amounts to as much as 0.05 increases in
AUC. The addition of IFS to RS can lead to a 5% increase in
accuracy (93%–98%), a 10% increase in sensitivity (90%–100%),
and 3% decrease in specificity (97%–94%) for gliomas (Table 2).
Importantly, optimal tissue classification benefits are obtained
when the full fluorescence spectroscopic information is used. The
number of IFS spectral bands chosen by feature selection for tissue
classification affects the classification accuracy of IFS. Feature
selection chooses a subset of the spectral peaks, determining
which individual points in the spectra are used for subsequent
classification.

are
observed for up to approximately 25 spectral bands of data, with

Tissue classification using DRS combined with RS and IFS was
valuable in normalizing the IFS data by mitigating the effect of
optical attenuation from hemoglobin to ensure fluorescence data
are minimally affected by intrinsic tissue absorption.

 Discussion
In situ cancer detection is profoundly important because resid-
ual cancer following surgery negatively influences the time to
cancer recurrence and survival time. There is thus a need for the
development of highly sensitive and specific cancer detection
instruments that can be seamlessly integrated into clinical prac-
tice. Here, we report on the design, development, and clinical
testing of an in situ intraoperative, label-free, optical cancer
detection system that combines IFS, DRS, and RS. Using this
multimodal optical cancer detection system, we found that solid
cancers can be detected with extremely high accuracy and sensi-
tivity. The AUC from ROC analysis demonstrated improvements
by as much as 0.04 from 0.95 for standalone RS to 0.99 when
combined with tissue fluorescence. This amounts to intraopera-
tive cancer detection accuracies, sensitivities and specificities of
97%, 100%, and 93%, respectively. Improvements at the level
reported here for all spectroscopy techniques combined become
more important as sensitivity and specificity approach 100%, as it
is indicative of approaching the threshold for complete resection
and the associated survival benefits for many cancers. In this
study, the spectral information from diffuse reflectance signals
was normalized to fluorescence signals to attenuate the impact of
intrinsic tissue absorption and scattering leading to spectral
deformations specifically related to the presence of intrinsic
fluorescent molecules.
One of the most profound findings was that the detection
capabilities of the system were virtually unaffected by cancer type,
indicating that this new multimodal machine learning classifica-
tion technique can automatically classify tissue using the spectral
features associated with the molecular characteristics of cancer.
For example, we found that peaks and bands from Raman spectra
correlated with molecular processes typically associated with
cancer biology, including increased chromatin and nuclear vol-
ume, weakened immune response, and adaptation of the extra-
cellular matrix to promote cell proliferation, cell migration, and
angiogenesis.
Our results are exciting because the development and adaption
of this novel technology is possible for a wide range of applica-
tions in open surgeries, minimally invasive laparoscopic, and
robotic surgeries to detect cancer, cancer margins, and the cancer-
normal tissue interface. This technology can also be used in other
interventional oncology procedures, such as bronchoscopies and
colonoscopies, to detect cancers that may not be visually obvious
to the interventionalist and thereby increase the diagnostic accu-
racy of these procedures and treatments. Those potential applica-
tions are supported by the adaptive potential of the technology,
which has already led to the development of wide-field imaging
systems (50), submillimeter diameter surgical probes and optics-
based biopsy needles.
The total imaging time of 8 seconds reported here can be
potentially reduced by up to a factor of 10 by using more
powerful LEDs for DRS and IFS, as light exposure levels used in
this study are far below the maximum permissible tissue
exposure in the visible region of the electromagnetic spectrum
(ANSI Z136 Standards).
Future developments of our platform technology will involve
testing in clinical trials designed to evaluate the robustness of the
technique across a larger patient population and for a variety of
cancer types. These will provide a substantial collection of spectra,
which can then be used to assess the robustness of spectral features
from the unique and differential molecular species. These trials
will also be required to assess the effectiveness of this system using
patient outcome metrics such as residual cancer following surgical
intervention, diagnostic accuracy, progression-free survival, and
overall survival.
