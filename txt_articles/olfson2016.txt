IMPORTANCE Although psychiatric inpatients are recognized to be at increased risk for suicide
immediately after hospital discharge, little is known about the extent to which their
short-term suicide risk varies across groups with major psychiatric disorders.
OBJECTIVE To describe the risk for suicide during the 90 days after hospital discharge for
adults with first-listed diagnoses of depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia,
substance use disorder, and other mental disorders in relation to inpatients with diagnoses of
nonmental disorders and the general population.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This national retrospective longitudinal cohort included
inpatients aged 18 to 64 years in the Medicaid program who were discharged with a
first-listed diagnosis of a mental disorder (depressive disorder, bipolar disorder,
schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and other mental disorder) and a 10% random sample
of inpatients with diagnoses of nonmental disorders. The cohort included 770 643 adults in
the mental disorder cohort, 1 090 551 adults in the nonmental disorder cohort, and 370
deaths from suicide from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2007. Data were analyzed from
March 5, 2015, to June 6, 2016.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Suicide rates per 100 000 person-years were determined
for each study group during the 90 days after hospital discharge and the demographically
matched US general population. Adjusted hazard ratios (ARHs) of short-term suicide after
hospital discharge were also estimated by Cox proportional hazards regression models.
Information on suicide as a cause of death was obtained from the National Death Index.
RESULTS In the overall population of 1 861 194 adults (27% men; 73% women; mean [SD] age,
35.4 [13.1] years), suicide rates for the cohorts with depressive disorder (235.1 per 100 000
person-years), bipolar disorder (216.0 per 100 000 person-years), schizophrenia (168.3 per
100 000 person-years), substance use disorder (116.5 per 100 000 person-years), and other
mental disorders (160.4 per 100 000 person-years) were substantially higher than
corresponding rates for the cohort with nonmental disorders (11.6 per 100 000 person-years)
or the US general population (14.2 per 100 000 person-years). Among the cohort with
mental disorders, AHRs of suicide were associated with inpatient diagnosis of depressive
disorder (AHR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-2.8; reference cohort, substance use disorder), an outpatient
diagnosis of schizophrenia (AHR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.2), an outpatient diagnosis of bipolar
disorder (AHR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1), and an absence of any outpatient health care in the
6 months preceding hospital admission (AHR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.5).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE After psychiatric hospital discharge, adults with complex
psychopathologic disorders with prominent depressive features, especially patients who are
not tied into a system of health care, appear to have a particularly high short-term risk for
suicide.

T
he period immediately after psychiatric hospital dis-
charge poses an exceptionally high risk for suicide.1-7
Although only about 6% of mental health outpatients
receive psychiatric inpatient care each year,8 approximately
one-third of all suicides among patients with mental disor-
ders occur within 3 months of discharge from an inpatient
psychiatric unit.9 Knowledge of which mental disorders and
other readily identifiable patient characteristics put adults at
highest short-term risk for suicide after psychiatric hospital
discharge might shed light on the mechanisms of acute risk
for suicide and guide interventions to prevent suicide.
During the first year after psychiatric hospital discharge,
approximately 0.3% to 1.3% of psychiatric patients die by
suicide.4,10,11 A meta-analysis of studies of psychiatric
inpatients12 reported that during the first year after hospital
discharge, major depressive disorder but not schizophrenia,
bipolar disorder, or substance use disorder is associated with
a significantly increased relative risk for suicide. A Swedish
study of patients admitted to the hospital for attempted sui-
cide reported that suicide rates in the first year after dis-
charge are markedly elevated for patients with a diagnosis of
schizophrenia or bipolar and unipolar depressive disorders.13
A recent study of active-duty soldiers who were admitted for
inpatient psychiatric care found that inpatient diagnoses of
nonaffective psychosis and somatoform or dissociative disor-
ders were significantly related to suicide risk during the first
postdischarge year.14
Fromaclinicalperspective,understandingsuicideriskfac-
tors over relatively short time frames is particularly useful.
Muchofthelongitudinalepidemiologicresearchonsuiciderisk
has focused on only 1 psychiatric disorder15-17 rather than risks
across mental disorders. As a result, relatively little is known
about the relative risk for suicide across the major psychiatric
disorders or the role of psychiatric comorbidity. To help ad-
dresstheseissues,weexaminedsuicideriskduringthe90days
after hospital discharge within a cohort of nonelderly pa-
tients (aged ≤64 years) in the Medicaid program. We focused
on inpatients with a primary discharge diagnosis of a mental
disorder and included comparisons with the general US popu-
lation. In keeping with prior research on the epidemiology of
suicide,weanticipatedthatmalesex,depressivedisorders,and
a history of deliberate self-harm would be associated with the
short-term risk for suicide.18 Because connectedness to sup-
portiverelationshipswithhealthcareprofessionalsisakeycon-
struct in suicide prevention models,19 we also examined
whether adult psychiatric inpatients who had no contact with
outpatient care during the 6 months before their hospital ad-
mission were at increased short-term risk for suicide after psy-
chiatric hospital discharge.
Methods
Sources of Data
The inpatient cohort was extracted from National Medicaid
Analytic Extract data from January 1, 2001, to December 31,
2007 (not including data from Arizona, Delaware, Nevada, Or-
egon,andRhodeIsland),fromtheCentersforMedicare&Med-
icaidServices.Thedatesandinformationaboutcausesofdeath
were derived from linkage to the National Death Index, which
providesacompleteaccountingofstate-recordeddeathsinthe
United States and is the most complete resource available for
tracing mortality in national samples.20 Data from the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics were used to provide US
population suicide rates.21 The data, which are deidentified,
were determined to be exempt from human participant re-
search review by the institutional review boards of New York
State Psychiatric Institute and Rutgers University.
Inpatient Cohort Assembly and Group Assignment
To focus on hospital admissions for acute care, the inpatient
cohort was restricted to adults who were 18 to 64 years of age,
had hospital admissions of 1 to 30 days in duration, were not
discharged to an institutional setting, and were eligible for
Medicaid services during the 180 days before admission
(eTable 1 in the Supplement). The cohort was partitioned
based on the first listed discharge diagnosis of the first
observed hospital admission into the following 6 mutually
exclusive groups based on codes from the International Classi-
fication of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clincial Modification (ICD-
9-CM): (1) depressive disorder (296.2x, 296.3x, 296.82, 298.0,
300.4, and 311); (2) bipolar disorder (296.0x, 296.1x, and
296.4x-296.8x); (3) schizophrenia (295); (4) substance use dis-
order (291, 292, and 303-305); (5) other mental disorders
(other 290-319); and (6) diagnoses of nonmental disorders.
A 10% random sample of the group with hospital admis-
sions lasting for 1 to 30 days and no primary or other hospital
discharge diagnoses of a mental disorder served as the com-
parison group with nonmental disorders. No patient contrib-
uted more than 1 observation to the cohort. The cohort was
followed up until the date of death from any cause or 90 days
after index hospital discharge, whichever came first.
Suicide
The outcome of interest was suicide within 90 days of dis-
charge. Suicide was defined as International Statistical Classi-
fication of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revi-
sion (ICD-10) codes X60 to X84, Y87.0, or U03 (terrorism
involving suicide) as the primary cause of death by the Na-
tional Death Index, consistent with the US federal definition of
suicideusedbytheCentersforDiseaseControlandPrevention.22
Key Points
Question Which inpatients are at highest short-term risk for
suicide after hospital discharge?
Findings In this national retrospective longitudinal cohort of
almost 1.9 million adult inpatients in the Medicaid program, suicide
risk during the first 90 days after hospital discharge was highest
for patients with first-listed depressive disorders, followed by
those with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and substance use
disorders and lowest for patients with nonmental disorders.
Meaning Recently discharged psychiatric inpatients, especially
those with mood disorders, are at exceptionally high short-term
risk for suicide.

Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics
Based on Medicaid eligibility data, cohort members were clas-
sified by age (18-34, 35-54, and 55-64 years), sex, and race or
ethnicity (white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, and His-
panic). In addition to white race, the white group included in-
dividuals identified as Native American or Alaskan, Asian, Na-
tive Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and more than 1 race.
Cohort members were also classified by geographic region
(West, Midwest, South, and Northeast).
Variables representing outpatient mental health treat-
ment within 180 days preceding the index inpatient admis-
sion were used to characterize the occurrence of any outpa-
tient treatment of depressive disorders, alcohol use disorder,
drug use disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety dis-
orders, or other mental disorders (eTable 2 in the Supple-
ment) and any treatment for deliberate self-harm (ICD-9-CM
codes E950-E959) or any emergency department visits for
mental disorders. Length of the inpatient admission was par-
titioned as 1 to 4, 5 to 8, and 9 to 30 days. A separate variable
of no outpatient care in the past 180 days was defined as pres-
ent if no outpatient health care visits for mental or nonmen-
tal disorders were recorded during the 180 days preceding the
index inpatient admission.
Analysis
Data were analyzed from March 5, 2015, to June 6, 2016. The
distributions of background characteristics of inpatients were
first examined by the principal diagnostic group, including de-
pressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, substance
use disorder, other mental disorders, and nonmental disor-
ders. For each group, person-years of follow-up, number of
deaths from suicide, and suicide mortality rates per 100 000
person-years of follow-up were determined overall and strati-
fied by sex and between the cohorts with any mental disor-
der and no mental disorder by age group.
The mean annual suicide rate for US adults aged 18 to 64
years (2001-2007) was calculated overall and separately for
men and women. For the groups with any mental disorder and
each of the 5 mental disorder subgroups, age-, sex-, and race-
or ethnicity-matched annual suicide rates for the US popula-
tion were also determined. Within the inpatient study groups,
we used Cox proportional hazards regression models to de-
termine unadjusted and age-, sex-, race- or ethnicity-, and re-
gion-adjusted hazard ratios of suicide during the follow-up pe-
riod in each psychiatric disorder group compared with the
nonmental disorder group. Among the cohort with a princi-
pal inpatient diagnosis of a mental disorder, Cox proportional
hazardsregressionmodelswerefitwitheachbackgroundchar-
acteristic as the independent variable and time until suicide
orcensoringduringfollow-upasthedependentvariables.Sepa-
rate unadjusted models were fit for each background charac-
teristic, and then 1 model including all background character-
istics simultaneously was fit to test independent effects.
Separate models were also fit for men and women. We plot-
ted Kaplan-Meier cumulative risk curves for each mental dis-
order group and the nonmental disorder group and used log-
rank tests to examine pairwise differences of each mental
disorder group with the nonmental disorder group. We also
plotted cumulative risks for suicide among men and women
with any principal inpatient diagnosis of a mental disorder.
A separate adjusted Cox proportional hazards regression
model included a covariate that rescaled the number of out-
patient mental disorder group diagnoses within the 180-day
prehospital period as an interval scale (theoretical range, 0-6).
A supplementary analysis examined short-term suicide risk
stratified by the number of outpatient visits in the 180 days
before admission. All statistical analyses were performed with
SAS software (version 9.4; RTI).

per 100 000 person-years). The suicide rate for the demo-
graphically matched cohorts varied from 10.7 to 13.8 per
100 000 person-years.
Compared with the cohort with nonmental disorders, the
short-term suicide rate was approximately 15.4 times higher
in the cohort with any mental disorder (Table 1). Adding all
deaths from external causes of undetermined intent (ICD-10
codes Y10-Y34) to deaths from suicide increased the short-
term death rate of the cohort with any mental disorder from
178.3 to 229.5 per 100 000 persons-years.
The90-dayrateofsuicidewasnearlytwiceashighformen
as for women in the cohort with any mental disorder (238.3
vs 130.2) and approximately 4 times as high for men as for
women in the nonmental disorder cohort (33.4 vs 7.8) (Table 1).
When the cohorts were stratified by age groups, young adults
(aged 18-34 years) had the highest hazard for short-term sui-
cide risk associated with any mental disorder (eTable 4 in the
Supplement).
Short-term Hazard of Suicide
During the first 90 days after hospital discharge, the cumula-
tive risk for suicide was significantly greater for each of the 5
mental disorder cohorts than for the nonmental disorder co-
hort (depressive disorders, 57.9; bipolar disorder, 53.2; schizo-
phrenia, 40.3; substance use disorders, 28.7; other mental dis-
orders,39.5;andnonmentaldisorders,2.9per100000persons)
(Figure 2). The cumulative short-term risk for suicide was also
significantly higher in men than women within the mental dis-
order cohorts (58.1 vs 32.1 per 100 000 persons) (Figure 3).

In unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression mod-
els that were limited to the cohort with any mental disorder,
the hazard for suicide was significantly associated with older
patient age; male sex; Hispanic and non-Hispanic white race
or ethnicity (black race was the reference group); an inpa-
tient diagnosis of depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophre-
nia (substance use disorder was the reference group); outpa-
tient diagnosis of a depressive disorder or bipolar disorder
during the past 6 months; and treatment of deliberate self-
harm during this period. In a mutually adjusted model that si-
multaneouslycontrolledforeachofthedemographicandclini-
cal variables, the hazard for suicide was associated with older
patients, men, and patients with Hispanic and non-Hispanic
white race or ethnicity, an inpatient diagnosis of a depressive
disorder, an outpatient diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar
disorder, and an absence of outpatient health care in the past
6 months before hospital admission. For the fully adjusted
model, the hazard ratio for the absence of outpatient health
care was 1.7 (95% CI, 1.2-2.5), implying an increase in the short-
term risk for suicide. We found a few differences in adjusted
hazards for short-term suicide among men and women with
any mental disorder (Table 2).
The recent outpatient mental health diagnosis of a larger
number of different types of mental disorders was also re-
lated to a larger short-term risk for suicide, although the lin-
ear trend test was not significant in the fully adjusted model
(P = .06) (eTable 5 in the Supplement). Patients with a larger
number of outpatient visits (≥31) during the 180 days before
hospital admission also had an increased short-term risk for
suicide (eTable 6 in the Supplement).
Discussion
Among inpatients treated for psychiatric disorders, short-term
risk for suicide was highest for patients who were hospitalized
for the treatment of depressive disorders, followed closely by
patients hospitalized for bipolar disorder. Men, adults aged 45
to 64 years, and white psychiatric inpatients were also at an el-
evated short-term risk for suicide. Consistent with risk models
thatemphasizeconnectednesstohealthcareprofessionalsand
othersupports,psychiatricinpatientswhohadnotreceivedany
outpatient health care in the 6 months before hospital admis-
sion were also at increased short-term risk for suicide.
During the first 90 days after psychiatric hospital dis-
charge, suicide risk among women and men was highest for
thosewithdepressiveandbipolardisorders,followedbyschizo-
phreniaandsubstanceusedisorder.InaDanishstudywithgen-
eral population controls,3 suicide risk was also highest during

the first month after hospital discharge among patients with
mood disorders, followed by schizophrenia and substance
abuse disorders. In a long-term Danish study23 that followed
up patients for as long as 36 years, however, suicide risk was
highest among women with schizophrenia, followed by those
withbipolardisorder,unipolardepression,andsubstanceabuse
and among men with bipolar disorder, followed by those with
unipolar depression, schizophrenia, and substance abuse. Al-
though depressive episodes may pose the highest short-term
risks, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia appear to pose heavy
long-term risks.
Recent outpatient diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizo-
phrenia incrementally increased the short-term risk for sui-
cide above and beyond a primary inpatient diagnosis of de-
pression. The co-occurrence of several psychiatric disorders
is generally associated with increased or additive functional
impairment, disease burden, distress,24,25 and suicide risk
factors.26 We found some support for the concept of additive
suicide risk associated with a larger number of different clini-
cal disorders. Similar additive interactive effects between the
number of psychiatric disorders and the risk for suicide at-
tempts has been found in the general population,27 which sug-
gests that risk is mediated through a general psychopathol-
ogy factor.28
Psychiatric inpatients who had not received any outpa-
tient health care during the 6 months before their hospital ad-
missionwereatincreasedshort-termsuiciderisk,aswerethose
with a large number of visits. An absence of treatment before
psychiatric hospital admission is strongly related to treat-
ment disengagement after hospital discharge,29 and fewer out-
patient mental health care visits after psychiatric hospital dis-
charge may increase the short-term risk for suicide.14 Some
interventions that promote follow-up mental health contacts
after hospital discharge reduce suicide attempts and deaths.30

From the standpoint of inpatient psychiatrists, patients who
have not been in contact with the health care system for sev-
eral months before their inpatient admission may merit dedi-
cated efforts to coordinate their follow-up care.
Suicide attempts are strong risk factors for subsequent
death from suicide.31 We found that a recent history of delib-
erate self-harm was associated with the short-term risk for sui-
cide, although the association was somewhat reduced in mag-
nitude after controlling for demographic and other clinical
characteristics. Underreporting of deliberate self-harm in the
administrative data32 may have attenuated the association be-
tweendeliberateself-harmandsuicideinthishigh-risksample.
Previousresearchhasdemonstratedthat,inrelationtothegen-
eral population, patients who present to general hospitals with
deliberate self-harm are at markedly increased and persis-
tent risk for subsequent suicide.33
Demographic risk factors for suicide among recently dis-
charged psychiatric inpatients resembled suicide risk factors
in the general US population. In both populations, the risk is
greater for men than women, older than younger adults, and
white than black or Hispanic individuals.34 In keeping with re-
searchthatcomparesthedemographiccharacteristicsofdeaths
from suicide among adults with and without any recent men-
talhealthtreatment,8,35themalepreponderanceofdeathsfrom
suicide was less striking among inpatients with mental disor-
ders than among those without mental disorders. One pos-
sible explanation for the narrower male predominance of risk
for death from suicide among mental health patients is a ten-
dency for psychologically distressed women to have a greater
propensity than correspondingly distressed men to seek men-
tal health care36 and thus have a higher likelihood to be hos-
pitalizedduringperiodsofacutedistress,leadingtohigherthan
expected rates of suicide after hospital discharge. In addi-
tion, male suicide decedents may be more likely to have alco-
hol use disorders than female suicide decedents,37 which
may contribute to proportionately lower rates of outpatient
mental health treatment among men than women before
suicide.
This study has several limitations. First, we have no means
of validating the accuracy of the first-listed diagnoses of men-
tal disorders in the Medicaid claims data. Second, different re-
sults may have been obtained if privately insured and unin-
sured inpatients with psychiatric disorders were included in
the analysis. However, Medicaid is the single largest payer for
inpatient mental health services in the United States.38 Third,
information was not available concerning several factors that
are widely believed to pose a risk for suicide, such as a family
history of suicide, lifetime personal history of attempted sui-
cide, proximal stressful life events, self-harm events, and ac-
cesstolethalmeans.Fourth,stigma,39lowautopsyrates,40and
emigration may have contributed to an underreporting or mis-
classification of suicide in the death certificate data. Fifth, our
claims-based measure of deliberate self-harm does not cap-
ture self-harm events that do not result in medical care41 and
does not distinguish self-harm injuries with suicidal from non-
suicidal intent.42 Finally, the data reflect suicide mortality pat-
ternsin2001to2007,whichmayhavechangedinrecentyears,
and a nonelderly adult population, which may not reflect risks
in other age groups. For example, the suicide rate of our male
cohort with depressive disorders (393.0 per 100 000 person-
years) was considerably lower than the suicide rate of an older
postdischargecohortofveteranswithdepressivedisorders(568
per 100 000 person-years).12
Conclusions
Psychiatricinpatientsareathighriskforsuicideduringthefirst
few months after hospital discharge. Under financial pres-
sures to shorten inpatient stays, inpatient psychiatrists com-
monly face clinical uncertainties in determining when pa-
tients are no longer at short-term risk for suicide. Among
inpatients with primary diagnoses of mental disorders, a dis-
charge diagnosis of depression was associated with the high-
est short-term risk for suicide. Recent outpatient diagnoses of
schizophrenia or bipolar disorder incrementally increased the
risk, as did the absence of recent contact with the outpatient
health care system. These patterns suggest that complex psy-
chopathologic diagnoses with prominent depressive fea-
tures, especially among adults who are not strongly tied into
a system of care, may pose a particularly high risk. As with
many studies of completed suicide, however, the low abso-
luteriskforsuicidelimitsthepredictivepowerofmodelsbased
on clinical variables. These constraints highlight the critical
challenge of predicting suicide among recently discharged in-
patients based on readily discernible clinical characteristics.
