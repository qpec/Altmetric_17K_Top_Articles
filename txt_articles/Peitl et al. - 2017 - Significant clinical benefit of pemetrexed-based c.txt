Introduction
Mesothelioma is usually considered to 
be an aggressive and lethal neoplasm 
arising from the mesothelial cells lining 
of pleura, peritoneum, pericardium, and 
tunica vaginalis testis.[1] Most frequent 
localization of mesothelioma is in the 
pleura, which accounts for about 70% of 
all mesotheliomas.[2] Therefore, the majority 
of literature focuses on the pleural variety 
of mesothelioma while diffuse malignant 
peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) has been 
evaluated to a far lesser extent, mainly 
because it accounts for only 10%–15% of 
all malignant mesotheliomas.[3] To put those 
percentages into perspective, it should be 
mentioned that incidence rates for DMPM 
in industrialized countries vary between 
0.2 and 3 cases per million.[4] Due to the 
rarity of this entity, most of the available 
clinical information about DMPM treatment 
is derived from retrospective single‑center 
series, 
which 
have 
inherent 
selection 
bases.[5] So far, DMPM has been poorly 
described with case reports being very 
few and far between.[6‑18] That leads us to 
the fact that currently, there is no broad

Abstract
Diffuse malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (DMPM) is generally an understudied disease, largely 
because most molecular and clinical studies of mesothelioma have been conducted in patients with 
the more common malignant pleural mesothelioma. We present the case of a 45‑year‑old male that 
initially presented with abdominal discomfort and ascites. Diagnostic workup revealed advanced 
DMPM. Bimodal treatment was stared with cytoreductive surgery and hyperthermic intraperitoneal 
perfusion with chemotherapy procedure, followed by pemetrexed systemic monotherapy. After 
the disease progression, and because of a very good previous treatment response to pemetrexed, 
we decided to rechallenge systemic pemetrexed, along with the introduction of cisplatin. Although 
the intent behind systemic treatment was at first solely palliative, overall survival after the initial 
diagnosis was 50 months. Treatment based on rechallenging pemetrexed with or without cisplatin 
in patients with advanced DMPM can result in a quite satisfactory disease control and symptom 
management.

Case Report
In September of 2009, a 45‑year‑old male 
patient 
was 
hospitalized 
complaining 
of 
periodical 
constipation 
and 
lower 
abdominal pain and presenting with a 
clinical syndrome of debilitating ascites. 
Patient was otherwise healthy, without 
serious 
illnesses 
in 
medical 
history, 
and was not taking any medications. 
Initial 
workup 
consisted 
of 
physical 
examination, routine clinical laboratory 
tests, echocardiography, chest X‑ray, and 
abdominal ultrasound. Laboratory tests 
revealed only elevated C‑reactive protein 
levels (101, range 0–5 mg/L). Abdominal 
ultrasound revealed ascites, with flank 
bulging and shifting dullness. Diagnostic 
paracentesis was conclusive for metastatic 
carcinoma with nonspecific cytological 
features.

and alpha‑fetoprotein were within normal range. Chest 
multislice computed tomography (MSCT) showed no 
evidence of intrathoracic involvement, whereas abdominal 
MSCT revealed a focal, localized lesion in the lower 
part of left kidney, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and 
omental cake form in the anterior abdominal wall, with a 
predominance of ascites. Other diagnostic procedures were 
also performed (abdominal X‑ray, upper gastrointestinal 
tract endoscopy, and colonoscopy), but findings remained 
inconclusive. Explorative laparotomy was performed 
with probatory excision which discovered pelvic tumor 
mass infiltrating adjacent structures. Histopathology and 
immunochemistry staining was as follows: Calretinin and 
CK 5/6 were positive, whereas CD15 and BerEP4 were 
negative. Findings such as these are consistent with the 
diagnosis of a diffuse malignant peritoneal monomorphic 
epithelioid mesothelioma [Figures 1‑5].
The patient denied any previous exposure to asbestos. 
Incomplete 
cytoreductive 
surgery 
(CRS) 
following 
hyperthermic intraperitoneal perfusion with chemotherapy 
(HIPEC) was performed. At our institution, we use mitomycin 
C which was dosed at 40 mg/m2, warmed at 40°C, and then 
circulated true the peritoneal cavity for 90 min by perfusor.
After a relatively slow 5‑month postoperative recovery 
period (18), fludeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission 
tomography‑computed tomography (PET‑CT) restaging 
was performed. New locus with increased metabolic 
activity was found in anterior mediastinum, measuring 
1.4 cm × 3.2 cm × 2.3 cm, highly suspicious for 
malignancy. Furthermore, we discovered a newly formed 
solitary metastasis on the splenic basal surface, along 
with multiple intrasplenic lesions. Cytological analysis 
of anterior mediastinal lesion was strongly suggestive 
for 
metastatic 
peritoneal 
malignant 
mesothelioma, 
which in turn confirmed intrathoracic involvement. Such 
involvement within only 5 months from initial diagnosis 
is very rare and highly indicative of a very aggressive 
type of the tumor. Initial systemic treatment approach 
consisted of six cycles of mono pemetrexed (500 mg/m2) 
with supplementation of folic acid and vitamin B12 due to 
the state of the patient. Chemotherapy was administered 
in 3‑week intervals, on an outpatient basis, and was 
generally very well tolerated. Posttreatment PET‑CT 
evaluation 
showed 
complete 
mediastinal 
response 
with partial abdominal response of the nodal lesion at 
splenic basal surface. Routine follow‑up during the next 
12 months was performed in 3‑month intervals. During

that period, two postchemotherapy PET‑CT scans were 
performed as the only means of evaluating DMPM 
progression. First follow‑up scan, performed 6 months 
after first‑line chemotherapy, showed stable intrathoracic 
and intra‑abdominal disease [Figure 6a‑d]. The patient 
presented with a good Karnofsky performance status 
(KPS >90). Second follow‑up scan, 12 months after 
first‑line chemotherapy, showed disease progression. New 
locus of high (18) FDG uptake was detected in the right 
internal mammary lymph node with bilateral pleural nodal 
lesions. New intrahepatic and intrasplenic metastases, 
along with numerous intra‑abdominal and intrapelvic 
nodal‑like lesions were found, while the preexisting 
solitary metastases showed morphological progression. 
As the patient was physically stable and of a satisfying 
KPS score (>80), due to the disease progression, we 
decided for a systemic therapy consisting of rechallenging 
pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 with cisplatin (75 mg/m2) as a 
second‑line chemotherapy means. Previously, described 
chemotherapy schedule was also administered in 3‑week 
intervals on an outpatient basis. Main adverse events, 
according to common toxicity criteria, were hematologic 
toxic effects: Grade 2–3 neutropenia and Grade 2–3 
anemia. Both were successfully treated with supportive 
treatment protocols. Given the fact that patient’s 
clinical status was satisfactory and KPS only slightly 
decreased (KPS >70), chemotherapy was continued up 
to eight cycles. Control MSCT scans showed already 
known pleural nodal lesions, without significant change 
in their size and number compared to previous scans, 
which suggested stable intrathoracic disease. On the other 
hand, partial regression of intra‑abdominal and intrapelvic 
secondary nodal lesions was evident. There was no 
evidence of lymphadenopathy or free fluid in the abdomen. 
Further follow‑up was ambulatory as disease was deemed 
stable and in partial regression.
Last performed follow‑up MSCT scan was 6 months after 
the completion of second‑line chemotherapy (October 
2013). 
Unfortunately, 
intra‑abdominal 
secondary 
lesions further progressed. At that time, there were no 
available reports regarding treatment modalities for 
advanced DMPM, especially in the case following two 
lines of chemotherapy. Systemic treatment options were 
exhausted (due to the fact that the patient declined 
further gemcitabine and carboplatin treatment options 
that were still available), surgical treatment was not a 
feasible option, and radiotherapy produces questionable 
results due to the diffuse nature of the disease itself, 
while in this specific case, it was not applicable due 
to the location and size of DMPMs intra‑abdominal 
deposits. Further medical approach was therefore based 
on best supportive care.
Discussion
Clinical and radiological presentation of early stage 
mesotheliomas is nonspecific. That is why most DMPMs 
are diagnosed in their advanced stages, with a considerable 
amount of time passing before reaching the correct 
diagnosis.[19] Pathogenesis of DMPM is still unclear, and 
relationship between asbestos exposure and DMPM is not 
nearly as straightforward as is the case with malignant 
pleural mesothelioma.
In a not so distant past, patients such as presented here 
would be considered preterminal and therefore treated 
only palliatively and supportively, with quite a short life 
expectancy. Nowadays, treatment of choice for complete 
cytoreduction is CRS/HIPEC. On the other hand, guidelines 
for systemic therapy are not that straightforward. Available 
scientific data support pemetrexed in combination with

cisplatin as a first‑line treatment option, while gemcitabine, 
carboplatin, and cisplatin are often considered as 
possible second‑line treatments.[3,11,20] Due to the fragile 
postoperative state of the patient and because DMPM was 
deemed advanced at the time, single‑agent pemetrexed 
as a palliative chemotherapy was an appropriate initial 
approach, even though current treatment recommendations 
suggest pemetrexed combined with cisplatin. Six cycles 
of first‑line pemetrexed chemotherapy were followed by a 
1‑year chemotherapy‑free period, as the optimal duration of 
chemotherapy for DMPM patients is still not established. 
Therefore, in this specific case of a patient with minimal 
burden of disease, we decided to observe for eventual 
disease progression. At that point, main goals were to 
minimize treatment toxicity and optimize patient’s quality 
of life. After the disease progression was established, 
second‑line chemotherapy was selected as a treatment of 
choice due to the satisfactory medical condition of the 
patient. As we already stated, data regarding the treatment 
of DMPM are scarce. However, Gilani et al. published a 
case report following their experience in the second‑line 
treatment of advanced DMPM where they suggested 
that rechallenging pemetrexed with cisplatin may be a 
reasonable treatment option for patients who responded 
to the same drugs in the first line of chemotherapy.[21] In 
light of those facts, we sought a somewhat unconventional 
treatment approach, as we based second‑line chemotherapy 
on rechallenging pemetrexed with the addition of cisplatin. 
Eight cycles of pemetrexed with cisplatin were applied, 
which lead to slower disease progression, prolonged overall 
survival, and better quality of life. Time to progression 
calculated from first‑ to second‑line chemotherapy treatment 
was 12 months and overall survival after re‑treatment was 
7 months. Despite a highly unfavorable prognosis, patient 
lived for more than 50 months after the initial diagnosis. 
Nevertheless, it needs to be stressed out that complete 
recovery or even cure was never considered to be a 
reasonable expectation. According to the available medical 
reports, progression‑free survival and median overall 
survival (OS) seem to be highly variable, with median 
overall survival ranging from 13.1 to 92 months.[11,22] Those 
periods seem to be influenced by the extent of disease at 
presentation, ability to surgically resect gross disease, 
gender, or intensity of treatment.[11,22] Physicians dealing 
with such a rare entity as DMPM have to bear in mind 
that the prognosis and overall survival of patients suffering 
from peritoneal mesothelioma has changed considerably 
during the last decade, even for the advanced stages, and 
that treatment of such patients should not only consist of 
symptomatic or palliative care.
