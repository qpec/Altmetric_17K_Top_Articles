Abstract Musculoskeletal injuries account for more than
70% of time away from sports. One of the reasons for the
high number of injuries and long return to play is that we
have only a very basic understanding of how our training
alters tendon and ligament (sinew) structure and function.
Sinews are highly dense tissues that are difficult to char-
acterize both in vivo and in vitro. Recently, engineered
ligaments have been developed in vitro using cells from
human anterior cruciate ligaments or hamstring tendons.
These three-dimensional tissues can be grown in a labo-
ratory, treated with agents thought to affect sinew physi-
ology, and then mechanically tested to determine their
function. Using these tissues, we have learned that sinews,
like bone, quickly become refractory to an exercise stim-
ulus, suggesting that short (
\
10 min) periods of activity
with relatively long (6 h) periods of rest are best to train
these tissues. The engineered sinews have also shown how
estrogen decreases sinew function and that a factor released
following intense exercise increases sinew collagen syn-
thesis and function. Last, engineered sinews are being used
to screen possible nutritional interventions that may benefit
tendon or ligament function. Using the data derived from
these tissue-engineered sinews, new nutritional and train-
ing regimes are being designed and tested with the goal of
minimizing injury and accelerating return to play.
1 Incidence of Soft-Tissue Injury in Sport
Soft-tissue injuries, those affecting muscles, tendons, and
ligaments, are extremely common at all levels of sport. In
youth sport, *50% of all injuries are sprains [1]. In college
athletics, the rates of ankle sprains remained relatively
constant, at *1 per 1000 athlete exposures, over the
15 years between 1988 and 2004 [2]. By contrast, anterior
cruciate ligament (ACL) ruptures increased by 1.3% per
year to 0.14 per 1000 athlete exposures over the same time
period. In professional sports, the incidence of soft-tissue
injury for players reaches 60% for the English Premier
League [3] and nearly 70% in the National Football League
[4]. Beyond sporting populations, diabetic individuals are
up to ten times more likely to experience tendon injuries
than non-diabetic individuals [5], and tendon injuries
increase with aging as evidenced by the fact that 80% of
people in their 80 s have experienced a ruptured tendon [6].
Even though musculoskeletal injuries are extremely com-
mon and have huge personal, competitive, and financial
costs, very few advances have been made in preventing
these injuries.
Tendons and ligaments are often grouped together into a
single category (termed sinew in this review) because of
similarities in their molecular composition, structure, and
general function. However, the importance of the funda-
mental difference, that a tendon attaches a compliant tissue
to a stiff tissue, whereas a ligament attaches two stiff tis-
sues, is often underappreciated. The connection of two
mechanically disparate tissues could result in stress and
strain concentrations (i.e., one tissue stretches much more
than another at the interface), which would lead to failure
(rupture). The tendon overcomes this issue by being a
variable mechanical tissue (Fig. 1) [7]. This means that a
healthy tendon is more compliant near the muscle and

 becomes stiffer as it nears the bone. The compliant region
of a tendon is believed to protect the attached muscle from
injury, by acting as a shock absorber. For example, during
running, a healthy tendon lengthens to absorb energy
allowing the muscle to contract isometrically [8]. However,
when tendon stiffness exceeds the isometric strength of the
muscle, either the biomechanics of the movement must
change or the muscle is forced to undergo potentially
damaging
lengthening
contractions.
Functionally,
this
means that even though in both tendons and ligaments
ultimate tensile strength (load at which they fail) increases
as a function of stiffness [9], a stiffer tendon is more likely
to produce muscle damage during the same exercise than a
healthy compliant tissue [10].
The varying mechanics within a healthy tendon are
achieved by variations in the orientation and crosslinking
of the collagen within the tendon. Along the length of a
tendon, the molecular crosslinks that connect adjacent
collagen
molecules
and
fibrils
increase
[11],
and
crosslinking is known to increase the stiffness of a tendon
[12]. Therefore, because there are more crosslinks near the
bone than the muscle, stiffness increases moving from
muscle to bone [7, 13]. Interestingly, when a joint is
inactive (such as when in a cast) or the muscle is prevented
from contracting against load, the tendons that cross that
joint lose the compliant region and become stiffer close to
the muscle [7, 13], likely because of an increase in
crosslinks.
From the background above, the most important mes-
sages are: (1) tendon/ligament injuries are common in daily
activities and at every level of athletic performance, (2) a
healthy tendon has varying stiffness along its length and
the compliant region acts as a shock absorber that protects
the muscle from injury, and (3) as a result of the tissues
they attach, tendon and ligament are functionally different:
the stiffer the ligament the better, whereas if tendon stiff-
ness is too high injuries will increase to the associated
muscles.
2 Modeling Sinew Physiology In Vitro
For years, scientists, coaches, and athletes considered
tendons and ligaments mechanical bands that did not
respond to exercise. However, it is now clear that these
tissues respond to loading. For example, the patellar tendon
in the dominant leg of fencers and badminton players is
20–30% larger than that of their trail leg [14]. Further,
nutritional interventions, such as consuming a whey protein
supplement, have the potential to increase tendon hyper-
trophy that results from strength training (Fig. 2) [15]. This
means that sinews are dynamic tissues. Interestingly, the
existing data suggest that tendons rapidly respond to
changes in muscle strength, possibly to minimize changes
in the peak strain across the tendon during contraction [16].
However, it is important to note that even though part of
the tissue is dynamic, the collagen at the core of a tendon
does not turn over between the ages of 17 and 70 years
(Fig. 3) [17]. Together, these data suggest that an adult

healthy tendon, the muscle end of the tendon (red) stretches much
more than the bone end (green), whereas the mid-tendon region

 tendon grows like a tree, adding and removing collagen
only on the outside [18].
Because tendons are dynamic tissues, understanding
how exercise and nutrition increase the synthesis of col-
lagen and improve tendon function could allow us to
improve performance, prevent injury, and accelerate return
to play. However, unlike many tissues, tendons largely
comprise extracellular proteins. In fact, the number of cells
within a tendon decreases with age until in adult tendons,
fewer
than
0.01
cells/lm2
remain
[19].
Therefore,
obtaining sufficient intracellular protein from a tendon
biopsy to perform standard biochemical assays can be
extremely challenging. Together with the fact that proteins
within the core of the tendon turn over very slowly [17],
this means that it is very difficult to understand how the
cells within a healthy adult tendon respond to nutrition or
exercise.
For these reasons, over the last 10 years, my laboratory
and others have developed a three-dimensional model of a
human tendon/ligament [20–24]. To achieve this goal, we
isolate human fibroblasts from the remnants of ruptured
ACLs collected during reconstructive surgery [25]. The
collagen within the ACL is enzymatically digested and the
cells from within this matrix are released and grown in
culture. The cells can be expanded and this allows us to
make hundreds of ligaments from the same donor, elimi-
nating any genetic differences between subjects. To engi-
neer ligaments, cells are embedded into a gel made from
fibrin, the same protein that forms blood clots. We use this
matrix because it is the biological matrix that the cells are
exposed to in development or during injury repair [26].
Furthermore, using fibrin instead of collagen allows us to
quantify collagen production as an outcome measure in our
experiments because any collagen in the graft has to have
been made by the cells. The cells continue to divide within
the fibrin gel and over 7 days contract around two calcium
phosphate cement anchors that are placed in the culture
dish to serve as bones (Fig. 4). After 7 days, the fibrin
contracts into a single tissue between the anchors and
continues to develop like an embryonic tendon or ligament
[21]. As with developing tendons/ligaments [27], these
engineered tissues have more cells and less matrix [21],

Achilles tendon. The amount of C14 as a percent modern carbon
(pMC) in collagen isolated from the central core of the Achilles
tendon was compared with that in the atmosphere over time to
determine the rate of collagen turnover in the Achilles tendon. The
relationship between the C14 levels in the central core and that found
in the atmosphere indicates that the turnover rate of collagen is
extremely slow. In fact, most of the samples measured indicated that
the collagen in the center of the Achilles had not turned over since the
individual was 17 years of age Adapted from Heinemeier [17]

 their rate of collagen synthesis is significantly higher [28],
they express more developmental collagen isoforms [20],
and they are much weaker than adult sinews [24]. Despite
these significant differences, these engineered tissues may
provide a model that will be useful in understanding the
effects of exercise and nutrition on tendon/ligament func-
tion. Subsequent sections outline some of the exciting
findings using this model, how these data compare with the
animal/human data (where possible), and how what we are
learning using this model can improve performance,
decrease injuries, and accelerate return to play.
3 Loading and Sinew Function
Tendons, like other forms of fibrous connective tissue such
as bone and ligaments, adapt to their loading state. In the
tendons of mature animals and humans, disuse leads to a
decrease in total collagen [29, 30], whereas acute exercise
increases the rate of collagen deposition [31]. Even though
activity is known to regulate cellular processes within
tendons and ligaments, the effect of different frequencies,
intensities, and durations of exercise is largely unstudied.
To begin to understand what type of activity was optimal
for sinew, engineered ligaments were stretched at different
frequencies, intensities, and durations and the molecular
response was determined [25]. These experiments showed
that the molecular response to loading was independent of
the frequency and intensity of loading, because ranges from
1 load/10 s to 1 load/s and from 2.5 to 10% stretch pro-
duced the same molecular response. This is consistent with
animal experiments where the molecular response to
resistance exercise was the same in tendons regardless of
whether the muscle underwent shortening, isometric, or
lengthening contractions [31]. The only parameter that did
alter the cellular response was time. Within 10 min of
starting the activity, the molecular response had reached its
maximum. If loading continued, the molecular signals
began switching off [25]. Further experiments showed that
it took 6 h for the cells to become responsive to exercise
again [25]. Using this information, we developed an
intermittent exercise program consisting of 10 min of
activity followed by 6 h of rest. After 5 days, the engi-
neered ligaments that had undergone the intermittent
activity protocol produced more collagen than those that
were exercised continuously [25]. These results are similar
to what we know occurs in bone in vivo; very few loading
events followed by 6–8 h of rest result in the greatest
amount of bone mineral deposition [32].
Clinically, these data suggest that limited range-of-mo-
tion exercises even if performed with a light weight should
be effective at increasing collagen synthesis in a develop-
ing or regenerating tendon or ligament. From our model
and the existing in-vivo data, the important message is that:
repeated short periods of activity that load the connective
tissue followed by long periods of rest appear to be opti-
mum for connective tissue health and function.
4 Hormonal Effects on Sinew Function
Female athletes participating in cutting and jumping sports
have a four to six times greater incidence of ACL rupture
than their male counterparts [33]. Interestingly, the degree
of knee laxity [34, 35] and incidence of ACL rupture [36]
are related to circulating estrogen levels. This suggests that
even though there are well-established biomechanical dif-
ferences between men and women, hormone levels might
directly affect ligament function. To attempt to understand
the mechanism underlying this effect, we mimicked the
estrogen surge that occurs just before ovulation by tran-
siently increasing estrogen levels in our culture model and
measuring the resulting changes in mechanics [37]. Inter-
estingly, as little as 48 h in physiologically high estrogen
was enough to decrease the stiffness of our ligaments
without any change in the collagen content. A change in
stiffness without a concomitant change in collagen sug-
gested that there was a change in the crosslinking of the
collagen. To directly test this hypothesis, we treated our
ligaments with high estrogen for 24 or 48 h and measured
the
activity
of
lysyl
oxidase,
the
primary
collagen
crosslinking enzyme in ligaments. Consistent with our
hypothesis, estrogen decreased the activity of lysyl oxidase
by more than 80% at the 48-h timepoint even though its
expression only decreased by 20% [37]. This indicates that
the transient increase in estrogen during the menstrual
cycle decreases enzymatic crosslinking, resulting in a
decrease in stiffness that places the ACL at a greater risk of
failure.
While estrogen is known to decrease sinew function, as
described in Sect. 3, exercise has a positive effect. While
most of the benefit of exercise is the result of the direct
effect of loading [15, 25], exercise is known to have a
global positive effect on collagenous tissues [38]. To test
whether the hormonal changes that result from strength
training are beneficial for sinew function, our team drew
blood from 12 healthy young male individuals before and
after resistance exercise [39]. The serum from these sub-
jects before and after exercise was isolated and then used in
the growth media of the engineered ligaments. The effect
of the different sera on collagen synthesis and mechanics
was then determined. Constructs grown in the post-exercise
serum showed a significant increase in collagen content
and mechanics, suggesting that something within the
exercised serum improves sinew function [39]. The results
showed that the effect was not mediated by growth
S8

 hormone or insulin-like growth factor-1, but that the hor-
mone did signal through the phosphoinositol 3-kinase/
mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) and
extracellular regulated kinase pathways. These data suggest
that exercise produces a global signal that improves con-
nective tissue function. Identifying this factor might pro-
vide a mechanism to improve sinew health and function,
and accelerate return to play.
Another significant finding arising from the study of the
effects of serum on engineered ligament function was that
treatment with high levels of recombinant growth hormone
had no effect on the collagen content or mechanics of our
grafts
[39].
In
contrast,
insulin-like
growth
factor-1
increased engineered ligament collagen and mechanics in a
dose-dependent fashion. These data support the idea that
within the physiological range, growth hormone has little
direct effect on sinew function [40]. However, growth
hormone can increase collagen synthesis and improve
recovery following immobilization, likely through its reg-
ulation of insulin-like growth factor-1 [41, 42].
5 Nutritional Interventions to Improve Soft-Tissue
Function
Compared with muscle, the science of nutritional interven-
tions that can improve soft-tissue function in humans is in its
infancy. One article has shown that whey protein can
improve tendon hypertrophy in response to strength training
[15]. However, whether this was the result of a direct effect
on the tendon or an indirect effect related to greater muscle
hypertrophy and strength gains is still unclear. In support of
a role for whey, a similar tendon hypertrophy was seen in
rats following 5 weeks of leucine supplementation after a
period of malnutrition [43]. The molecular target of whey
and leucine is mTORC1 [44], and as described in Sect. 4,
mTORC1 was also activated by post-exercise serum.
Therefore, to determine whether mTORC1 activity was
important in collagen synthesis and sinew mechanics, our
team added rapamycin to the culture media to specifically
block mTORC1. Seven days of treatment with rapamycin
decreased the mechanics and collagen content of the grafts
by more than 50% (unpublished observation). However,
whether these data are the result of a decrease in collagen
synthesis or a decrease in cell proliferation within our model
has yet to be determined. Regardless, these data suggest that
using leucine-rich whey protein can activate mTORC1
within sinews and increase collagen synthesis. However, the
effects of whey protein on sinew structure and mechanics in
humans have yet to be determined.
Other than leucine-rich protein, no nutritional interven-
tions have been shown to have an effect on sinew in humans.
However, using the tissue-engineered ligament model, our
team has shown that amino acids that are enriched in col-
lagen (proline, hydroxyproline, and hydroxylysine) added
together with vitamin C can improve collagen synthesis
[24]. The vitamin C effect is not surprising given that
vitamin C deficiency results in scurvy, a disease character-
ized by a loss of collagen [45]. Vitamin C functions within
connective tissues as an essential co-factor for prolyl 4-hy-
droxylase, an enzyme required for hydroxylation of proline
and the synthesis and secretion of procollagen [45]. The
amino acids that have a positive effect on collagen synthesis
in our model include glycine, proline, lysine, hydroxylysine,
and hydroxyproline. These amino acids are the main com-
ponents of collagen, suggesting that even in our in-vitro
model, where amino acids are five times the physiological
level, excess proline, lysine, and their hydroxylated analogs
can still be beneficial. Interestingly, these same amino acids
are enriched in gelatin, which is usually made from the skin,
tendon and ligaments of cows or pigs. We have now begun
feeding gelatin to people and have seen extremely positive
responses on collagen production and return to play in ath-
letes after injury. In fact, in a randomized, double-blind
crossover clinical trial, we found that ingestion of 15 g of
gelatin 1 h before 6 min of jump rope is able to double
collagen synthesis [46]. Further, serum taken before or 1 h
after feeding a placebo or 5 or 15 g of vitamin C-enriched
gelatin results in a dose-dependent increase in collagen in
engineered ligaments [46]. These data support the use of
gelatin as a nutritional intervention to increase collagen
synthesis in sinew and bone.
6 Conclusions and Science-Based
Recommendations for Training to Improve
Tendon Health and Performance
From the background provided above, a series of recom-
mendations can be developed to maximize performance,
decrease the risk of tendon/ligament injury, and/or accel-
erate return to play.
•
Consider incorporating a connective tissue health
session into training. This type of session would involve
\
10 min of activity targeted to a tendon/ligament that
is prone to injury. For example, runners would do a
session to target the hamstrings and patellar and
Achilles tendons, whereas baseball players would target
the throwing arm. These exercises could be performed
with a light weight and using a limited range of motion
if necessary. The connective tissue health session
should be performed either 6 h before or after any
other training.
•
Following injury, athletes should begin training as soon
as possible. Training can consist of simple range-of-
Lessons from Engineered Ligaments

 motion and limited weight supported exercises because
the amplitude of the load is not important for stimu-
lating collagen production [25]. The training should
again consist of\
10 min of activity followed by 6 h of
rest. Reasonably, this means that the athlete will train
for three short periods each day.
•
Consume leucine-rich protein as part of training. Beyond
the direct effects this will have on muscle [47], tendons
will also benefit from the added muscle mass and
strength and possibly a greater mTORC1 activation [15].
•
Glucose uptake into tendons increases during exercise
[48]. However, because blood flow to inactive tendons
is limited, nutrient delivery to tendons following
exercise is believed to be relatively low. This suggests
that any nutritional intervention that is designed to
directly target a specific tendon/ligament needs to be in
place prior to exercise.
•
Thirty to sixty minutes before training, athletes should
be encouraged to consume 15 g of gelatin in either a
liquid or gel form [46]. The exact amount of gelatin and
whether this will vary with body weight is currently
being determined.
