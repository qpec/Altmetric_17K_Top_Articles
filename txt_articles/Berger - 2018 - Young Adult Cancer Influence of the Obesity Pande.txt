 Young Adult Cancer: Influence of the Obesity Pandemic
Nathan A. Berger
Objective: The purpose of this article is to review the association of the obesity pandemic with appear-
ance of cancers in young adults under age 50 and to define potential mechanisms by which obesity may
accelerate the development of malignancy.
Methods: A comprehensive narrative review was performed to integrate preclinical, clinical, and epide-
miologic evidence describing the association of obesity with cancer in young adults based on a search
of PubMed and Google databases.
Results: Results from more than 100 publications are summarized. Although they differ in age groups
analyzed and incidence of obesity, sufficient data exists to suggest an influence of the obesity pandemic
on the increase of cancer among young adults.
Conclusions: Cancer in young adults is occurring with increasing frequency. Overweight and obesity
have become major public health issues reaching pandemic proportions. Excess weight is associated
with increased cancer risk, morbidity, and mortality. Multiple murine models indicate that obesity not only
increases cancer incidence but also accelerates its development. Thus, the possibility exists that over-
weight and obesity may be contributing to the appearance of specific malignancies at younger ages.
This prospect, in association with the worldwide expansion of obesity, suggests an impending explosive
increase in obesity-associated cancers in young adults.

Introduction
Cancer in young adults is being reported with increasing frequency
and has become a matter of urgent concern (1). At the same time,
overweight and obesity have become major public health issues in
both children and adults, reaching pandemic proportions worldwide
(2,3). While it has been clearly documented that excess weight is
associated with both increased risk of occurrence and increased mor-
bidity and mortality for multiple malignancies (4-6), there has been
relatively little focus on the impact of overweight and obesity on
shifts in timing of cancer appearance to individuals of younger age.
However, recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data
indicate an increase in overweight- and obesity-associated cancers in
20- to 49-year-old individuals (Supporting Information Supplement
S1). Importantly, multiple murine models indicate that obesity and
obesogenic diets not only increase the incidence of malignancy but
also accelerate its development and shift its occurrence to earlier
ages (5,7-17).
Thus, the possibility needs to be considered that overweight and
obesity may be contributing significantly to the clinical appearance
of some malignancies at younger ages. This prospect, in associa-
tion with the continued worldwide expansion of obesity (2,3), sug-
gests an impending explosive increase in obesity-associated can-
cers
in
young
adults.
Anticipation
of
the
potential
dire
consequences of this evolution compels careful epidemiologic
monitoring; more research on mechanisms by which obesity pro-
motes and accelerates cancer, especially in young adults; develop-
ment of focused strategies for prevention; and potentially new
approaches to screening and care.
The goals of this article are 1) to enhance awareness of the obesity–
cancer linkage; 2) to illustrate how both obesity and obesogenic
diets may shift appearance of obesity-promoted cancers to younger
age groups, especially into the 20- to 50-year-old age group; 3) to
examine preclinical murine models and potential mechanisms by
which obesity and obesogenic diets accelerate the appearance of
malignancy; 4) to review the epidemiologic and clinical evidence
indicating where this may already be happening; 5) to identify
which obesity-associated cancers are most likely to pose this threat;
and 6) to consider approaches to better document and avert the
crisis.

 Obesity–Cancer Linkage
Although adolescent and young adult cancers have been operation-
ally defined as those occurring in the 15- to 39-year-old age group
(18), this article is focused on malignancies, most commonly associ-
ated with patients over age 50, that have recently been reported with
increasing frequency in the younger-than-50-year-old age group.
Moreover, because this article examines the impact of obesity on
cancers in young adults, it will concentrate on the 13 cancers listed
in Table 1, which, based on epidemiologic review by the Interna-
tional Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), have been identified
as having sufficient evidence to be linked to excess body fat (6). It
will not include discussion of tumors such as sarcoma, acute leuke-
mia, and others that may occur in young adults but have not been
clearly linked to obesity. It also will not consider malignancies such
as hematologic malignancies, prostate cancer, and others for which
evidence for an association with obesity has not reached the level of
significance as those recently reported (6). This article uses the fol-
lowing categories of BMI (weight in kilograms divided by square of
height in meters): normal weight, BMI 5 18.5-24.9; overweight,
BMI 5 25.0-29.9; obesity, BMI � 30; and severe or morbid obesity,
BMI � 40 (6).
Table 1, column 1 lists the 13 tumors recently reported by the IARC
for which there is sufficient evidence to identify an association
between obesity and specific malignancies (6). These malignancies
are arranged in order of annual incidence of new US cases (column
2) (19,20). Column 3 lists the US population attributable fraction
(PAF) as the percentage of each malignancy attributed to obesity for
both males and females (21). These data demonstrate an important
contribution of obesity to cancers of colon and rectum, thyroid,
esophagus, pancreas, and kidney in men and to breast, colon, kid-
ney, endometrium, esophagus, and gallbladder cancers in women.
With 253,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States, a
14% PAF calculates to 35,420 new cases per year attributable to
obesity. For colorectal cancer (CRC), adjusting for male/female dis-
tribution, the PAF indicates 22,655 new cases of CRC in men and
10,812 new cases in women attributable to obesity. Applying similar
calculations to the incidence and PAF data provided in Table 1 indi-
cates that in 2017, more than 144,000 of those cancers occurring in
the United States were attributable to obesity. However, this number
is probably an underestimate, as PAFs are not available for several
obesity-associated malignancies such as liver, myeloma, gastric car-
dia, or meningioma.
The fourth and fifth columns indicate the peak and usual age range
incidence for each of these tumors. The median age at which all
cancers are diagnosed in the United States is 66 years. While most
are diagnosed in patients older than 50 years (20), the appearance of
thyroid, ovarian, endometrial, and CRC cancers and meningiomas is
not uncommon in patients younger than 50 (20). Strikingly, as
shown in the sixth column of Table 1, of the 13 IARC obesity-
associated malignancies, at least 9 (shown in bold) have been
reported as occurring in young adults and are in the top 20 adoles-
cent and young adult cancers (18). The last column indicates murine

 model systems in which nine of the malignancies have been shown
to be accelerated and become more aggressive in association with
obesity (7-17).
Obesity Accelerates Cancer Development
From a mechanistic viewpoint, overweight and obesity are generally
considered to be promoters of cancer progression (5). Thus, over-
weight and obesity promote cancer by multiple concurrent mecha-
nisms, including 1) stimulation of low-grade inflammation and oxi-
dative stress with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines
such as IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and increased reactive
oxygen species (ROS), the latter of which may also contribute to
mutagenesis; 2) alteration of growth-promoting factor levels, espe-
cially insulin and insulinlike growth factor (IGF-1), which increases
in association with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance; 3)
altered sex steroid hormones with increased conversion of androgens
to estrogens resulting from increased adipose tissue production of
aromatase, the enzyme responsible for this conversion; 4) altered
adipocytokine proteins, including increased growth-promoting and
pro-inflammatory components such as leptin, retinol binding protein
4, resistin, and visfatin and reduced growth-controlling adipokines
such as adiponectin; 5) alterations in intestinal microbiome with
expansion of tumor-promoting species such as fusobacteria; and 6)
mechanical effects of obesity such as those leading to hiatal hernia
and gastroesophageal reflux disease, predisposing to esophageal ade-
nocarcinoma (5).
Figure 1 provides a conceptual model, supported by multiple murine
studies, of how obesity impacts cancer by accelerating its develop-
ment (7-17). As postulated for development of colon cancer, and now
widely accepted for multiple malignancies, mutations in a gatekeeper
gene (13,22,23), sometimes similar to those mutations causing heredi-
tary cancer syndromes, initiate sporadic tumors. Mutated cells then
progress through a multistage process in which multiple genetic
changes ultimately lead to the development of a benign premalignant,
and then to malignant, neoplasm with invasive and subsequently

 metastatic properties. For CRC, transformation from normal epithe-
lium to benign adenoma, ultimately leading to frank cancer and meta-
static disease, is projected to require at least seven independent
genetic events and possibly mutation in as many as 15 driver genes
(24) as well as multiple epigenetic alterations (25). In some cases, this
process may require long latent periods extending to multiple decades
to progress from normal epithelium to frank cancer.
The rate of progression to invasive cancer is determined by multiple
factors, including mutation and proliferation rates, which are affected
by DNA damage response, DNA repair systems, and a host of growth
factors. This rate may vary among different tumors and even among
different transformed clones in the same individual. Thus, obesity
may enhance mutation rates by generation of increased ROS. Impor-
tantly, however, high-fat diets (HFDs) and diet-induced obesity (DIO)
have been shown to accelerate tumor growth rates in association with
production of increased growth factors, such as insulin, IGF-1, leptin,
retinol binding protein 4, and others (8,26,27).
As shown in Figure 1, development of obesity, usually due to a
combination of HFD and decreased physical activity, results in
expanded fat mass, characterized by increased number and size of
adipocytes, some of which undergo necrosis and become surrounded
by macrophages to form crown-like structures with a propensity for
releasing proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNFa (28). In
addition, expanded and inflamed adipose tissues may provide
increased levels of multiple growth-promoting cytokines, adipokines,
and hormones, many of which accelerate the multistage transition
from normal tissue to invasive and metastatic cancer. This process
not only accounts for the accelerated development of tumors in the
presence of adipose tissue excess, but it also explains why patients
with obesity-driven cancers may present with more advanced tumors
at earlier ages. Thus, the long latent period required for initial pre-
sentation of many tumors provides the basis for obesity to impact
the process and, in fact, accelerate both the appearance and extent
of clinical disease. Accordingly, it is expected that initial mutations
for sporadic cancer will occur with similar frequency and at similar
ages in both normal patients and those with obesity. In addition, it
is possible that obesity-associated inflammation and ROS may fur-
ther contribute to mutagenesis and cancer initiation. Nonetheless, the
metabolic and growth-promoting consequences of concurrent or
prior obesity can provide the stimulus for accelerated development
of cancer and associated comorbidities, including death.
Systems Demonstrating That Obesity
Promotes and Accelerates Development
of Malignancies
The shortening of the latent period from benign to malignant disease
in association with obesity has been most clearly demonstrated at the
clinical level, where disease-associated monoclonal immunoglobulin
provides a biomarker for early detection and demonstration that obe-
sity accelerates the conversion of monoclonal gammopathy of
unknown significance (MGUS) to multiple myeloma (MM) (29). In
further support of this proposal that obesity does not initiate but rather
promotes cancer progression, almost all murine models in which obe-
sogenic diets and DIO promote tumors require experimental utiliza-
tion of genetically modified animals containing cancer-predisposing
genes or transplantation of preexisting tumor cell lines (5,7-17).
It is noteworthy that in some murine models, HFD has been shown
to promote CRC and breast cancer in mice that are resistant to DIO
(7,8,30). These studies indicate that proinflammatory and growth-
promoting effects of HFD, even in the absence of DIO, may acceler-
ate tumor progression. Other murine systems have shown that even
after HFD-induced DIO and subsequent weight loss, the tumor-
promoting effects of obesity may endure for varying time periods,
thereby providing a model for promotion of adult tumors by child-
hood, adolescent, and young adult obesity (7,8,30).
The contribution of proinflammatory and growth-promoting factors as
mediators in the HFD- and DIO-accelerated malignancies is further
illustrated by the demonstration that tumor-promoting effects of obe-
sity can be abrogated by molecular or pharmacologic interference
with proinflammatory and growth-promoting pathways such as phar-
macologic inhibition of receptors for insulin or IGF-1 (31), molecular
interference with leptin receptor (32), and genetic and pharmacologic
interference with proinflammatory activity of complement system (8).
It is further noteworthy that not all HFDs are equal in promoting
malignancy, as shown by olive oil, an important component of the
Mediterranean diet, which was found to protect against HFD accelera-
tion of gastrointestinal neoplasia in APCMin mice (8).
Clinical and Epidemiologic Evidence
Indicating That Obesity Shifts
Malignancies to Younger Ages
From a clinical and epidemiologic viewpoint, we focus initially on
CRC, which has become one of the major adult tumors generating
alarm for its increasing appearance in young adults (33). CRC, usu-
ally occurring between 45 and 84 years of age with peak incidence
at 67 years (20), and uncommonly seen in young adults, is now
being increasingly identified in both men and women below age 50
(20,34-39), with greater increase noted for left-sided sigmoid and
rectosigmoid CRC then right-sided CRC (35).
Analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program
(SEER) Population data and multiple Hospital Based Cancer Regis-
tries, covering periods from 1973 to 2017, indicates that CRC inci-
dence has remained stable and/or decreased in people over 50 by as
much as 3% per year. In contrast, CRC has shown an average 1.5%
increase per year among 20- to 40-year-old men and women
(40,41). Moreover, younger patients have been noted to present with
more advanced, higher-stage, more poorly differentiated disease, and
those presenting with stage IV CRC have shown inferior survival.
The overall decrease in incidence of CRC has been attributed to
expanded screening programs and removal of early premalignant
adenomas. Because of the much higher incidence of CRC in older
individuals, these programs have been primarily targeted at patients
over 50. Thus, increase in incidence and more advanced stage at
presentation among young adults have been attributed, in part, to
lack of screening and to tumor promotion by lifestyle factors includ-
ing obesity, consumption of red and processed meat, and possibly
alcohol and tobacco use (35,42).
Many of the above reports point to a concurrent increase of obesity
and CRC in the young. Some have documented increased obesity
and cancer in the same population; however, few have provided

 obesity demographics in the CRC patients (38). In addition, although
not specific for young adults, some series indicate an association of
obesity with increased risk of sigmoid and rectosigmoid cancers
(43). In an important study of more than 1.1 million Israeli Jewish
men with 19.5 million person-years of follow up, overweight and
obesity in adolescents aged 16 to 19 years were associated with a
substantially increased risk for colon cancer (HR 5 1.53, 95% CI:
1.17-2.0) but not for rectal cancer in adult years. The median age
for patients with newly diagnosed colon cancer was 43.3 6 8.7
years, thereby supporting an association of adolescent-detected obe-
sity with young adult colon cancer (37) and suggesting effects of
obesity over a long latent period of cancer development.
In addition to its association with increased risk for CRC, obesity is
also associated with a twofold increase in risk for colorectal ade-
noma (CRA), a premalignant precursor to CRC (44). CRAs have
been commonly reported in patients younger than age 55 (45) and
have been noted to be more advanced in patients with obesity (46).
In a study of people examined across an age range from 30 to
greater than 70 years, high BMI was identified as a risk factor for
CRA in 30- to 39-year-old men and 40- to 49-year-old women (36).
Thus, subjects with overweight or obesity are at increased risk for
developing CRC and its precursor, CRA, during young adulthood.
Moreover, obesity has been shown to precede the diagnosis of CRA
and CRC by long latent periods (47).
In summary, the clinical development of CRA and CRC fits well
with the model provided in Figure 1, including increased and early
development of obesity-associated benign adenoma preceding cancer
with a long latent period, providing time for the impact of obesity-
stimulated growth factors to accelerate tumor development. More-
over, in addition to decreased screening in young adults, obesity-
promoted progression may help explain why CRC in the young is
more advanced at the time of presentation (33).
While this discussion has focused on sporadic colorectal neoplasia
and its increasing appearance in young adults, additional insight is
provided by patients with known inherited predispositions to CRC,
including
familial
adenomatous
polyposis
or
hereditary
non-
polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC), bearing, respectively, mutations in
the gatekeeper genes, adenomatous polyposis coli, or mismatch
repair genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSG6, PMS2, EPCAM) (48). These
patients commonly develop CRA or CRC at younger ages, when
CRC risk has been shown to be increased in association with excess
weight (49,50). In a study of 937 HNPCC carriers followed at 14
institutions, with median age enrollment 44.9 years (36-53 years),
obesity was associated with a 2.4-fold greater risk for CRC com-
pared with normal and underweight reference groups. Interestingly,
there was no increase in risk in HNPCC patients with obesity ran-
domly assigned to aspirin (ASA), 600 mg daily, suggesting that
obesity-promoted CRC in HNPCC patients may be reduced by regu-
lar ASA use (51).
Female breast cancer is the most common US malignancy included on
the IARC obesity-associated cancer list, with peak incidence at 62
years and usual age range 55 to 84 years (20). Breast cancer in post-
menopausal women is usually estrogen receptor positive and is associ-
ated with increased risk in association with obesity (4). Of the tumors
listed in Table 1, breast cancer is unique in that a major variety, pre-
menopausal breast cancer, characterized by estrogen receptor negative
status, has been noted to occur at a relatively constant rate of 40% by
age 40 years (52), and obesity is associated with an overall decreased
risk of premenopausal breast cancer (53). Thus, because of the already
significant occurrence of premenopausal breast cancer in patients
under 40 years of age, it is difficult to determine if there is an obesity-
associated shift to younger age. However, premenopausal women at
high risk for breast cancer, including prior history of lobular carci-
noma in situ, generally considered a multifocal premalignant precur-
sor, have shown significantly increased risk of developing breast can-
cer in association with obesity (54). These high-risk premenopausal
women fit well into the latent process depicted in Figure 1 that is
accelerated by obesity. Moreover, unique insight is provided by
patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), tumors that lack
expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and human
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (55). These tumors, commonly
identified in premenopausal women, are refractory to hormonal and
cytotoxic chemotherapy (55). In a retrospective review of invasive
breast cancer among 1,064 patients from Walter Reed National Mili-
tary Medical Center, 160 patients had TNBC, of whom 89 were below
age 50 years and 148 either had overweight or obesity. Thus, TNBC
in all patients, including those younger than age 50, is highly associ-
ated with obesity (56).
Further insight is provided by patients with hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer wherein 80% of cases have been attributed to muta-
tions in BRCA1/BRCA2 (57). In a series of 176 multigenerational
kindreds, earlier appearance of breast cancer was noted in successive
generations, with age at diagnosis shifting from 51.8 years in grand-
parents to 48.7 years in parents, followed by 41.9 years in probands
and 34.7 in children (58). The shift to earlier age in successive gen-
erations was attributed to lifestyle factors including obesity. In other
studies, weight gain and number of pregnancies have been shown to
significantly increase risk of breast cancer, whereas weight loss
between age 18 and 30 years has been associated with decreased
risk of breast cancer (59).
Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), with peak incidence during age 60 to
74 years, is a noninvasive breast cancer precursor and is unusual before
age 35. DCIS has recently undergone a marked increase in detection
and occurrence from an incidence of 1.8 per 100,000 in 1973-1975 to
32.5 in 2004. The increase has mainly occurred in patients older than
50; however, DCIS has been noted to be increased in all age groups in
association with obesity (60). Thus, the breast cancer precursor DCIS,
familial breast cancer associated with BRCA mutation, and TNBC are
all increasing in incidence in young adults, and the increases are
associated with obesity (54-60).
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), the third most common IARC obesity-
associated malignancy (6), has a peak incidence for diagnosis at age
64 (20); however, several retrospective series have reported RCC
patients younger than 45 (61). Although up to 60% of patients with
RCC have been reported as having overweight/obesity (62), the spe-
cific percentage of patients under 45 with excess weight has not
been reported. However, in a case control study of 1,214 patients
and 1,234 controls, early adult obesity was associated with a 60%
increase in risk for RCC (63).
Endometrial cancer in the United States is the most common malig-
nancy of the female genital tract. It is most frequently diagnosed in
postmenopausal women aged 45 to 74 years (19,20). However, 2%
to 14% of endometrial cancers have been reported to occur in
women aged 40 years and younger (64). Sporadic endometrial

 cancers in the young are usually associated with high BMI and with
obesity rates reported to range from 37% to 60% (64). Many of
these patients have polycystic ovary syndrome characterized by obe-
sity, menstrual irregularity, infertility, and enlarged ovaries with
multiple ovarian cysts (64).
Thyroid cancer commonly occurs in young adults, with 28% of new
diagnoses in the 20- to 40-year-old age group. Its incidence in
patients under 65 is increasing (65), extending down to the 45- to
49-year-old age group in some South American countries (66). In
contrast with many tumors discussed in this article, thyroid cancer
in young adults is usually curable because it most frequently is
detected early as an asymptomatic neck mass. Cases in young adults
show a female preponderance; appear to be differentiated, with pap-
illary histology being more frequent than follicular; and frequently
harbor a mutation in the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, mitogen activated
protein kinase pathway (65).
Pancreatic cancer, with peak incidence in 70- to 80-year-old individ-
uals, is uncommonly observed below age 45 and is increasing in fre-
quency (19,20). Individuals with overweight or obesity between
ages 20 and 39 years had 2 to 6 years’ earlier onset of pancreatic
cancer compared with normal-weight controls (67). A UK survey
conducted between 1998 and 2006 showed no change in incidence
rate for males under 50 years; however, a slight increased incidence
was reported in females in the 20- to 39-year-old group (68). In a
retrospective review covering 1993 to 2008, 33 patients (5.7%) were
identified in the 50 years or younger age range. Only 3 (9%) had
obesity compared with 4 (12%) of the matched controls (69).
Hepatocellular cancer (HCC), with overall incidence in Western coun-
tries peaking at 60 to 70 years of age, is one of the most common can-
cers on a worldwide basis (70). Incidence rates in the United States
have increased by 2.5- to 3-fold over the past 35 years (71). On a
global basis, HCC is associated with liver injury from different etiolo-
gies including viral infections with hepatitis B and hepatitis C, hepato-
toxins including aflatoxin, chronic alcohol abuse, and metabolic alter-
ations that occur with obesity, the latter leading to metabolic
syndrome, consisting of obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, and dys-
lipidemia (72). The common pathway by which each of these insults
leads to HCC includes liver damage, followed by inflammation, usu-
ally leading to cirrhosis and then HCC, thereby providing an extended
latent period for obesity-promoted carcinogenesis.
Obesity-mediated liver damage progresses through nonalcoholic fatty
liver disease (NAFLD) showing steatosis and lipid deposition in liver
cells without inflammation, proceeding to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis
characterized by further fatty acid deposition and ballooning degener-
ation of hepatocytes with inflammation, leading to fibrosis, cirrhosis,
and HCC (72). In Western countries, where overweight and obesity
are common, NAFLD is present in 20% to 40% of the general popula-
tion (72). The increase in obesity and its comorbidities, including dia-
betes and metabolic syndrome in Western countries, is projected to
promote the incidence of HCC, especially in Hispanic men and Afri-
can American women (73).
Because NAFLD is a predisposing risk factor for HCC, it is notewor-
thy that NAFLD is increasing in young adults in association with the
increased incidence of obesity and metabolic syndrome (74). Thus,
NAFLD in young adults aged 18 to 30 years old has increased 2.5-
fold over the past three decades and is reported to be present in more
than half (57.4%) of young adults with morbid obesity (74).
In a recent US study, the Liver Cancer Pooling Project, composed
of 14 separate cohorts and containing 2,087 cases with prospectively
measured BMI and waist circumference, showed that excess weight
at the time of enrollment was associated with liver cancer in a dose
response manner (71). Although most of the cohorts enrolled “older”
Americans, 85 patients were younger than 50 years at the time of
enrollment, and 18 of these were diagnosed with liver cancer before
age 50, 3 of whom had obesity at the time of enrollment (P. Camp-
bell and C. Newton, personal communication). This observation that
18 of 85 patients developed liver cancer before age 50, along with
the high incidence of NAFLD in young adults with obesity, indi-
cates the importance of careful surveillance of HCC as another
malignancy likely to increase in young adults.
MM, characterized by malignant proliferation of plasma cells, ane-
mia, elevated levels of a circulating monoclonal immunoglobulin,
destructive bone lesions, and renal failure, is the second most com-
mon hematologic malignancy in the United States and the only pri-
mary malignancy of blood cells included by the IARC as related to
obesity (6). MM is diagnosed with a peak incidence of approxi-
mately 69 years and has maintained a constant incidence for at least
the past three decades (75). However, in three series reported since
1992, MM has been reported in patients younger than 45 with inci-
dences of 2.2%, 9.6%, and 15% (76,77). None of these series
reported BMI. In a pooled analysis of 242 MM cases in patients
younger than 50 compared with 1,758 age-matched controls, patients
showed a significant positive association of elevated BMI with risk
of MM and a greater than twofold increase in MM risk for patients
with severe obesity (78). Moreover, the incidence of MM has been
noted to be increased in patients who reported heavy compared to
lean body shapes during childhood and adolescence (75), providing
support for a potentially long latent period for the impact of obesity
on malignancy development. Interestingly, chromosomal abnormal-
ities characteristic of MM have been shown to be no different in
patients above or below age 45 (79).
MGUS, characterized by restricted proliferation of a predominant
clone of plasma cells, not exceeding 10% of marrow cells and
absence of diagnostic criteria for MM (80), is considered a universal
premalignant precursor of MM with variable rates of progression
(81). MGUS, identified in large population screenings by detection
of circulating monoclonal immunoglobulins, is most common in the
80- to 96-year-old age group; however, it has significantly been
reported in patients younger than age 50. In some of these cases, it
has been projected to have been present for latent periods in excess
of 20 years (82). Obesity has been shown to be associated with
increased risk for MGUS in women (83). Interestingly, although it is
considered a premalignant condition, MGUS shares many of the
genetic and cytogenetic changes noted in MM, including activation
of c-myc, del(17p), t(4:14), and 1q gains (81). In a retrospective
study of 7,878 MGUS patients identified through the US Veterans
Health Administration database, 39.8% had overweight and 33%
had obesity. Moreover, risk of transformation of MGUS to MM was
increased with obesity and black race (29,83).
Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) and gastric cardia adenocarci-
noma, both malignancies of glandular epithelium originating near the
gastroesophageal junction, have undergone a rapid increase in

 incidence over the past two to three decades (84,85). They are con-
sistently associated with overweight/obesity, and 10% of patients pre-
senting with EAC are noted to have morbid obesity (86). Although
EAC has a peak incidence in the 80-year-old age group (87), in a ret-
rospective study of 374 patients treated for EAC between 2000 and
2007, 63 (16.8%) were under age 50 (86). EAC may be preceded by
a premalignant precursor, Barrett’s esophagus (BE), commonly seen
in younger patients, where it is associated with chronic inflammation,
gastroesophageal reflux disease, and obesity (87).
In addition to their association with obesity at time of diagnosis,
occurrence of both EAC and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in later
years is increased following elevated BMI during early adulthood
(age 20) and with progressive weight gain between ages 30 and 50
years (73). In addition to the overall increase in occurrence of BE in
young adults (87) there has been a notable increase in EAC in
patients under age 40, and more than 10% of patients undergoing
surgery for EAC are reported to be �50 years old (88).
Meningioma constitutes 20% to 30% of all intracranial neoplasms,
with peak incidence in men in the 60- to 69-year-old age group and
in the 70- to 79-year-old age group in women (89,90). Cranial irra-
diation and obesity are risk factors (89), sometimes with long latent
periods of more than 20 years between radiation and diagnosis of
meningioma. Meningioma in the pediatric age group is seen as part
of hereditary syndromes such as neurofibromatosis with inherited
NF2 mutations. Somatic mutations of the NF2 gene are frequently
identified in sporadic cases of meningioma (90). In a report of 35
patients from a single institution and meta-analysis of more than
450 patients, meningioma occurring during first three decades of
life, with an average age at diagnosis of 25 years, had a female pre-
dominance but no notation of occurrence of obesity (90).
In contrast to many of the other cancers discussed in this article,
epithelial ovarian cancers are not uncommon among young women,
in whom they are thought to coincide with activity of the female
reproductive cycle (19,20). Increased BMI is a risk factor for epithe-
lial ovarian cancers, and elevated levels of IGF-1, which frequently
accompany obesity, are thought to contribute (91). Mutation of mis-
match repair genes including germ line mutations occur in a small
percentage of patients under 40.
Gallbladder cancer, a rare malignancy in the United States with
peak incidence in the 80-year-old group, is rarely seen or reported
in patients under 50 years of age (92). Risk factors for gallbladder
cancer include obesity and chronic inflammation associated with
gallstone disease. Chronic inflammation of 15 or more years has
been estimated to result in gallbladder cancer in genetically predis-
posed individuals. Treatment of cholelithiasis and cholecystitis by
surgical removal of the gallbladder has significantly decreased the
incidence of gallbladder cancer (93).
Association Between Obesity-Linked and
Young Adult Cancers
Of the 13 cancers identified by the IARC as being associated with
increased body fat (6), most have their highest incidence rates in
older adults. However, 5 of the 13 obesity-associated cancers,
including breast, thyroid, uterus, ovary, and stomach cancer, have
been identified by US SEER data as occurring in the top 20 cancers
in 20- to 39-year-old females and 5 of the 13, including colorectal,
thyroid, kidney, stomach and liver cancer, have been identified in
the top 20 in 20- to 39-year-old males (18). Of the 13 IARC
obesity-associated malignancies, all but gallbladder cancer have
been well documented to occur in significant numbers in patients
under 50 years of age, and 4 of these malignancies—colorectal,
breast, thyroid, and possibly pancreatic cancer—have been reported
to be increasing in the female young adult population. Moreover,
five premalignant precursors, including CRA for CRC, BE for
EAC, NAFLD for HCC, DCIS for breast cancer, and MGUS for
MM, have been reported to be increasing in the young adult popula-
tion in association with obesity. In addition, excess body weight
and/or weight gain has been noted to precede presentation of these
malignancies by long latent periods, in some cases by multiple
decades.
In summary, many of the malignancies noted to occur with increas-
ing frequency in young adults are among the 13 obesity-associated
cancers. With the expanding worldwide incidence of overweight and
obesity in children and young adults, the long latency period associ-
ated with many sporadic cancers, the demonstration in humans and
animal models that obesity accelerates the development of cancer,
and the probability that even obesity at young age has a long-term
effect on tumor progression, it is highly likely if not imminent that
obesity will lower the age of occurrence across the age spectrum,
shifting multiple malignancies to younger age groups in general and
to the young adult population in particular.
Overall, this assessment is limited because many of the reports of
malignancies in young adults do not provide anthropomorphic meas-
urements. Moreover, evaluation of these data often underestimates
obesity because patients with advanced malignancy frequently pres-
ent for evaluation after significant weight loss. Further evidence of
an association of cancer and obesity in young adults will require
more consistent reporting of anthropomorphic data at time of diag-
nosis as well as premorbid data when available. Because body mass
may be considerably reduced at time of cancer diagnosis, it is
important that these data be monitored in a prospective fashion
among the healthy pediatric and young adult population and made
available for analysis if and when malignancy is diagnosed. How-
ever, documenting and reporting this information are critically
important to more firmly establish the relation of obesity to young
adult cancers.
Disrupting the Linkage Between Obesity
and Young Adult Cancers
The data cited in this article portend an imminent threat of the
impact of the obesity pandemic on an age shift in occurrence of
obesity-associated malignancies, including their appearance in young
adults. This occurrence will require increased cooperation between
adult, adolescent, and pediatric oncologists, endocrinologists, and
weight management professionals for effectively evaluating and
dealing with the looming crisis. The most effective way to curtail
development of this problem is to prevent expansion of the obesity
pandemic in both children and adults. This is a critical challenge
since there are already 110 million children and adolescents and 640
million adults with obesity worldwide who constitute the at-risk
Review

 pool for development of obesity-accelerated malignancies (94,95).
Moreover, this at-risk population is even further expanded by the
demonstration that the effects of overweight/obesity may have a
long latent period and, in some cases, precede the diagnosis of
malignancy by decades. Thus, an important goal for medical profes-
sionals and supporting agencies is to encourage obesity prevention,
weight loss, and increased physical activity in both children and
young adults (3). In some cases, extreme measures such as bariatric
surgery are being considered in children and young adults with obe-
sity because of the potential consequences of disorders such as poly-
cystic ovary syndrome and fatty liver disease. Special attention
needs to be focused on detecting, monitoring, and reversing meta-
bolic syndrome in all patients, especially young adults.
Interestingly, the demonstration that ASA reduced incidence of CRC
in young HNPCC patients with obesity (51) indicates the importance
of further research to improve cancer prevention strategies in
patients with hereditary cancer syndromes and more broadly in
young adults with overweight or obesity (51). Like ASA, potential
chemopreventive agents for young adults with obesity must be rela-
tively nontoxic and safe for long-term administration. Metformin,
extensively used for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, has
already been shown, at low dose, to be safe and reduce recurrence
of colorectal adenoma in nondiabetic patients following initial polyp
resection (96). Because obesity-promoted cancers have been shown
in some cases to involve epigenetic changes (97), other potential
opportunities for chemoprevention in young adults include the use
of epigenetic targeted therapies (98).
In terms of screening the young adult population for early signs of
malignancy, what is clearly needed is a series of easily administered,
minimally invasive, and cost-effective screening tools. These might
include training and encouraging young women with obesity to per-
form breast self-examination, regular thyroid palpation by medical
and dental practitioners, stool DNA testing for both upper and lower
gastrointestinal pathologies (99), and further development of screen-
ing blood tests for circulating DNA, circulating tumor cells, and
other potential biomarkers (100). Because overweight and obesity
are lifestyle consequences, it is possible that they can be sufficiently
altered by lifestyle modifications to avert the impending expansion
of young adult cancers.O
