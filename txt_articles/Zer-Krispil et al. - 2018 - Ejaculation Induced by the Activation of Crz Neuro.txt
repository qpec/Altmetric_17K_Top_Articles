In Brief
Zer-Krispil et al. report that ejaculation
induced by the activation of male-specific
Crz neurons is sufficient to mimic all the
rewarding aspects of successful
copulation in Drosophila. The activation
carries positive valence, induces npf
transcript levels, drives appetitive
memories, and reduces the motivation to
consume ethanol as a drug reward.

SUMMARY
The reward system is a collection of circuits that rein-
force behaviors necessary for survival [1, 2]. Given
the importance of reproduction for survival, actions
that promote successful mating induce pleasurable
feeling and are positively reinforced [3, 4]. This prin-
ciple is conserved in Drosophila, where successful
copulation is naturally rewarding to male flies, in-
duces long-term appetitive memories [5], increases
brain levels of neuropeptide F (NPF, the fly homolog
of neuropeptide Y), and prevents ethanol, known
otherwise as rewarding to flies [6, 7], from being
rewarding [5]. It is not clear which of the multiple sen-
sory and motor responses performed during mating
induces perception of reward. Sexual interactions
with female flies that do not reach copulation are
not sufficient to reduce ethanol consumption [5],
suggesting that only successful mating encounters
are rewarding. Here, we uncoupled the initial steps
of mating from its final steps and tested the ability
of ejaculation to mimic the rewarding value of full
copulation. We induced ejaculation by activating
neurons that express the neuropeptide corazonin
(CRZ) [8] and subsequently measured different as-
pects of reward. We show that activating Crz-ex-
pressing neurons is rewarding to male flies, as they
choose to reside in a zone that triggers optogenetic
stimulation of Crz neurons and display conditioned
preference for an odor paired with the activation.
Reminiscent of successful mating, repeated activa-
tion of Crz neurons increases npf levels and reduces
ethanol consumption. Our results demonstrate that
ejaculation stimulated by Crz/Crz-receptor signaling
serves as an essential part of the mating reward
mechanism in Drosophila.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Mating interactions in Drosophila are orchestrated by neuronal
programs that integrate sensory signals into courtship and copu-
lation motor actions [8–12], as well as programs controlling mat-
ing drive, the persistence of copulation process, and its timing
[13–17]. To test the hypothesis that ejaculation induces the
rewarding value of mating, we asked whether promoting sperm
and seminal fluid release (SSFR) in the absence of a female part-
ner is sufficient to evoke the perception of reward. To uncouple
SSFR from the rest of the mating sequence, we focused on male-
specific corazonin (Crz) neurons located in the abdominal gan-
glion (AG), which were previously shown to induce SSFR [8],
and tested whether ejaculation induced by the activation of Crz
neurons is rewarding for male flies.
Different
behavioral
paradigms
in
Drosophila
make
it
possible to study distinct components of reward processing,
including the valence of the experience, expression of appeti-
tive memories, and the motivation to obtain reward [6, 7, 18–
24]. First, we tested whether ejaculation induced by activation
of Crz neurons promotes immediate pleasurable response.
Rewarding stimuli promote behavioral actions to extend their
duration, while aversive stimuli promote actions to reduce their
duration [25–28]. For example, in a two-choice preference
assay, flies prefer to reside in a zone where they receive opto-
genetic stimulation of reward-encoding neurons [22]. Using
this assay, we analyzed the position of male flies expressing
the red-shifted channelrhodopsin CsChrimson in Crz neurons
(CRZ > CsChrimson) in a rectangular arena under two condi-
tions lasting 5 min each: (1) both sides of the arena were un-
illuminated and (2) only one side of the arena was illuminated
by red LEDs (Figures 1A and S1). We calculated the positional
preference toward the illuminated side (see equation in Fig-
ure 1A). The last minute of each phase was used to test
whether there are genotype-dependent differences in posi-
tional preference and whether the preference is significantly
different than zero. None of the genotypes showed a signifi-
cant preference for the activation zone when both sides of
the arena were un-illuminated (Figure 1C). CRZ > CsChrimson
males, but not genetic controls, showed a strong positional
preference for the illuminated zone during the two-choice
phase (Figures 1D and 1E). Although optogenetic stimulation
of CRZ > CsChrimson induced periodic bouts of ejaculation
(Figure S2), their preference for the illuminated zone was not
due to a motor defect: they walked freely between the two
sides of the arena, and their average velocity during walking
bouts was similar to the genetic controls (Figure S3). These
results imply that activation of Crz neurons, which promote
ejaculation, has a positive valence.

 The CRZ-Gal4 expression pattern consists of male-specific
neurons in the AG, �14 non-dimorphic neurons in the central
brain, and dispersed expression throughout the optic lobe (Fig-
ure 1B). To test whether the positional preference observed in
males is produced by the activation of male-specific Crz neurons
in the AG, we repeated the two-choice preference assay in fe-
males that lack these cells. CRZ > CsChrimson females and
the genetic controls did not show positional preference for the
activation zone in either of the two phases (Figures 1F–1H).
Although it is not known whether male and female flies respond
similarly to hedonic stimuli, the lack of positional preference in fe-
males hints that the preference of male flies is mediated by acti-
vation of the male-specific AG Crz neurons. To strengthen this
conclusion, we used a CRZ driver that is not expressed in the
AG (CRZ-2fa-Gal4 [5]) to drive CsChrimson and assayed the po-
sitional preference of male flies. These flies did not show posi-
tional preference to the activation zone in either phase of the
experiment, again suggesting that the male-specific AG Crz neu-
rons are required (Figures 1I–1K).
Next, we performed olfactory conditioning experiments to test
whether the positional preference shown upon the activation of
Crz neurons is due to the rewarding effects of Crz-induced ejac-
ulation. CRZ > CsChrimson male flies were trained to associate
an odor (4-methylcyclohexanol or 3-octanol) with 45 s of Crz
neuron activation, and their preference to the paired odor was
subsequently tested when both odors were delivered simulta-
neously [21] (Figure 2A). As a control, the flies were exposed to
the odors in the absence of neuronal activation. CRZ >
CsChrimson males showed a positive, illumination-dependent
conditioned odor preference to the odor associated with optoge-
netic activation (Figure 2B), implying that activation of Crz neu-
rons induces appetitive memory. CRZ-2fa > CsChrimson male
flies that were trained under the same conditions did not show
conditioned odor preference (Figure 2C), suggesting that the
rewarding effects of activating the population of Crz neurons
results from the male-specific neurons located in the AG.
Repeatedmating eventsand repeatedexposureto intoxicating
levels of ethanol are known to induce expression of npf in the
brain [5]. To determine if the function of Crz neurons is necessary
for the mating-induced increase in npf transcript levels, Crz neu-
rons were inhibited by expression of the inwardly rectifying potas-
sium channel Kir2.1, and npf levels were compared in mated and
virgin male flies. Inhibiting Crz neurons was previously shown to
increase copulation duration by 5-fold and to block sperm and
seminal fluid transfer, resulting in non-fertile mating interactions
[8].Male fliesexpressingKir2.1in Crz neuronsandgenetic control
flies experienced five 1-hr-long sessions of mating with multiple
receptive virgin females (ratio 1:3) for 4 days (Figure 3A [lower
panel]). While the genetic controls showed a clear increase in
npf levels after mating, experimental flies, which did not accom-
plish successful copulation, showed similar npf levels as their
virgin counterparts (Figure 3A), implying that the function of Crz
neurons in stimulating ejaculation is necessary for npf induction.
We next asked if repeated activation of Crz neurons can mimic
natural copulation and induce npf levels. CRZ > CsChrimson
males were exposed to three 15-min-long activation sessions
(designed to mimic three mating events) per day for four consec-
utive days (Figure 3B [lower panel]). This activation protocol
induced a 4-fold increase in head npf transcript levels as
compared to unstimulated flies (Figure 3B). This increase in npf
was not observed in genetic controls subjected to identical con-
ditions (Figure 3B). To exclude the technical possibility that some
Crz-expressing neurons also express NPF, potentially causing
direct activation of NPF neurons while activating Crz cells, Crz
and NPF expression patterns were compared. Co-immunostain-
ing of CRZ-Gal4-driving mCD8-GFP with anti-NPF antibodies
revealed that there is no overlap, indicating the brain NPF and
Crz neurons represent mutually exclusive populations of neurons

(B and C) C RZ-GAL4 > CsChrimson males flies (B) or CRZ-2fa-GAL4 > CsChrimson males flies (C) were trained to associate an odor with the optogenetic
activation of Crz neurons. Conditioning protocol consisted of a single training session: 45 s of exposure to odor 1 (4-methylcyclohexanol [MCH]) coupled with
optogenetic activation (constant light, 617-nm LED light intensity, 20 mW/mm2) followed by 1 min of exposure to air and subsequent 45 s of exposure to odor 2
[3-octanol (OCT)]. To exclude innate bias toward the olfactory cues, another group was trained in reciprocal manner (group II). Conditioned odor preference was
immediately tested after the end of the training. Conditioned preference index (CPI) is the average between the CPIs of group I and group II. CRZ-Gal4 >
CsChrimson male flies (B) expressed appetitive memory to the odor that was previously paired with optogenetic activation. n = 8 for no activation control, n = 13
for the experimental group; mean ± SEM; Mann Whitney; p < 0.005. CRZ-2fa-Gal4 > CsChrimson male flies (C) did not form appetitive memories.

Figure 3. Activation of Male-Specific Crz Neurons Induces npf Transcript Levels and Reduces Ethanol Consumption
(A) Male flies expressing Kir2.1 in Crz neurons and genetic controls were mated with virgin females for 5 hr on four consecutive days, and their npf transcript levels
were compared to virgin counterparts (**p < 0.01, *p < 0.05, Student’s t test, n = 3 independent experiments with 15–20 fly heads each). Lower panel is schematic
illustration of experimental design.
(B–D) Flies expressing CsChrimson in Crz neurons (CRZ> CSChrimson) and genetic controls were subjected to spaced 15-min long activation sessions, repeated
on four consecutive days, after which the flies were frozen. npf transcript levels were analyzed using RT-PCR analysis in male flies (B), female flies (C), or when
activating brain-only Crz neurons in male flies (using 2fa-Gal4) (D). Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc analysis for
the fold change in npf-relative levels between light and dark conditions. Error bars signify SEM (B) F(2,6) = 41.0291, **p < 0.01, n = 3 independent experiments of
15–20 fly heads per sample, non-significant (C and D).
(E–G) Ethanol preference of CRZ > CsChrimson virgin males, and the genetic controls, was assayed for flies that were kept in the dark (E) after repeated 15 min
optogenetic activation, 3 times a day, for 3 consecutive days (F), or after repeated 15 min optogenetic activation of brain-only Crz neurons in male flies (CRZ-2fa-
GAL4) (G). Significant main effect of genotype was documented only in (F) F(2,21) = 30.3923 **p < 0.01, two-way repeated-measures ANOVA with Bonferroni

 (Figure S4). As a control, we performed similar activation exper-
iments in female flies, which lack Crz neurons in the AG, and in
male flies that express CsChrimson only in brain Crz neurons
using the CRZ-2fa driver. These flies did not show a change in
npf levels (Figures 3C and 3D). These experiments suggest
that activating male-specific Crz neurons in the AG, which in-
duces ejaculation, is sufficient to elevate npf levels and thus
mimics the molecular signature of successful copulation.
npf mRNA levels serve as a molecular representation of
different motivational states; they are increased by rewarding
events, such as successful mating and ethanol intoxication [5],
and are reduced by exposure to parasitic wasps or repeated sex-
ual deprivation in males [5, 29]. Sexual deprivation also reduces
the activity of NPF neurons [30]. We have previously established
a causal link between repeated copulation events, increased npf
levels, andreduced motivation to obtain external rewardssuch as
ethanol [5]. To strengthen the functional link between ejaculation
induced by the Crz neuron activation and the rewarding value of
mating, we tested whether activating Crz neurons is sufficient to
promote the high-reward state induced by mating that deters flies
from consuming ethanol. CRZ > CsChrimson males were sub-
jected to 3-day activation as before, and their voluntary ethanol
consumption was subsequently measured using a two-choice
ethanol consumption assay [5, 24] (Figures 3E–3G [lower
panels]). In the absence of activation, CRZ > CsChrimson male
flies and the genetic controls developed similar levels of prefer-
ence to consume ethanol (Figure 3E [upper panel]). Following
activation of Crz neurons, CRZ > CsChrimson flies showed an
aversion to ethanol-supplemented food compared to the genetic
controls, which preferred ethanol-containing food (Figure 3F
[upper panel]). In contrast, activation of Crz brain neurons using
the CRZ-2fa driver did not modulate ethanol consumption (Fig-
ure 3G), suggesting that AG Crz neurons are responsible for ejac-
ulation-dependent mating reward. These results imply that
activating Crz neurons or subsequent SSFR mimic both the
molecular and behavioral responses that accompany the reward
state that is naturally achieved by mating, where changes in npf
levels direct alteration in ethanol self-administration [5].
Our results so far illustrate a functional link between Crz-
induced ejaculation, immediate pleasurable response, and
long-term changes in motivational states represented by induc-
tion of npf and reduced motivation to obtain drug rewards. To
begin to study the circuit downstream of Crz neurons, we tested
whether activation of Crz-receptor neurons, whichinnervateejac-
ulatory organs and induce ejaculation [8], is rewarding. The Crz-
receptor Gal4 is expressed in male-specific AG neurons and in
numerous fat cells that surround the nervous system (Figure 4A).
Consistentwithpreviousresults [8], optogenetic activation ofCrz-
receptor neurons induces ejaculation in male flies (Figure S2). We
tested the preference of male flies to obtain optogenetic stimula-
tion of Crz-receptor neurons in a two-choice arena. The experi-
ment began with 2 min of dark, followed by 5 min where one
side is illuminated, then another 2 min of dark. We incorporated
a recovery phase after the activation phase to ensure that theacti-
vation effects are transient. CRZ-receptor > CsChrimson flies, but
not genetic controls, showed a strong light-dependent prefer-
ence for the activation zone (Figures 4B–4D). These results imply
that optogenetic activation of Crz-receptor cells confers a posi-
tive valence, similar to activation of Crz neurons.
Lastly, we tested whether activation of Crz-receptor cells in
male flies increases npf levels. CRZ-receptor > CsChrimson
males were exposed to three 5-min-long activation sessions
for 4 consecutive days. This activation protocol induced a
5-fold increase in head npf transcript levels as compared to flies
that were kept in the dark (Figure 4E). The increase in npf levels
was not observed in the genetic controls subjected to either acti-
vation or non-activation conditions (Figure 4E). Thus, artificial
activation of Crz-receptor cells, which promotes SSFR, is suffi-
cient to induce the immediate perception of reward, as well as
long-term molecular changes in neurons that process natural
and drug rewards. Since the CRZ-receptor Gal4 is not expressed
in brain neurons, these results further support our claim that the
rewarding properties associated with the activation of the entire
population of Crz neurons in male flies originate from the male-
specific neurons located in the AG. In addition, these results
suggest that CRZ release is not necessary for mating-induced
reward and that reward stimulus is not the activation of Crz neu-
rons per se, but probably other downstream events that take
place along the pathway that induces or perceives SSFR.
Our work demonstrates that activation of Crz neurons, which
induces SSFR, is sufficient to mimic all the rewarding aspects
of successful copulation: it carries positive valence, induces
npf transcript levels, drives appetitive memories, and reduces
the motivation to consume ethanol as a drug reward. The former
two effects are also induced by activation of Crz-receptor neu-
rons. Considering the causal link between activation of Crz/
Crz-receptor neurons and ejaculation, it is impossible to distin-
guish whether these rewarding effects are directly induced by
ejaculation or result from Crz/Crz receptor neuron activation in-
dependent of ejaculation. Overall, our data suggest a model in
which Crz neurons are activated during courtship encounters
that culminate in copulation, causing the activation of Crz-recep-
tor neurons. Activation of Crz-receptor neurons induces SSFR,
which is sensed by some yet unidentified sensory neurons,
and the information is subsequently relayed to the NPF neurons
in the brain, leading to increase in npf transcription (Figure 4F).
The elevation in npf transcript and the changes in ethanol con-
sumption require several activation events over the course of
four days, possibly reflecting different aspects of immediate
and long-term accumulation of rewarding experiences. While
the activation of Crz neurons promotes immediate reward, it is
possible that the observed changes in npf transcription are
noticeable only upon repeated rewarding experiences. A recent
study demonstrated that activation of NPF neurons induces im-
mediate reward in both male and female flies [22], suggesting
that the observed changes in npf transcript levels not only
encode the valence of the experience, but possibly integrates
the magnitude and cumulative changes in internal reward levels.
There is substantial evidence to support the proposed role of
the NPF/NPF-receptor system as a central player in modulating
and encoding motivational states associated with sugar reward,
sexual and drug reward, and the homeostatic regulation of
motivational responses [22, 29–33].
CRZ is a highly conserved insect neuropeptide that regulates
various physiological processes in arthropods [34] including
response to stress [35–37], ethanol sensitivity and metabolism
[38–40]. Theoretically, the reduction in voluntarily ethanol con-
sumption in response to the activation of Crz neurons could

(F) Model based on the results. Crz and Crz-receptor neurons are activated during copulation-induced ejaculation leading to sperm and seminal fluid transfer
(SSFT), which induces npf levels in the brain.

 result from changes in sensitivity to ethanol and its metabolism.
Flies deficient in Crz/Crz-receptor neurons show delayed recov-
ery from ethanol-induced sedation due to defective acetalde-
hyde metabolism [39], implying that Crz neurons function to
promote recovery form ethanol sedation. Therefore, activating
Crz neurons should induce rapid ethanol metabolism, allowing
for higher rather than lower ethanol consumption. In addition,
previous attempts to identify an association between genes
that affect ethanol sensitivity and sedation to genes/pathways
that affect ethanol consumption phenotypes failed to show any
significant correlation [41]. Thus, the decreased ethanol con-
sumption in male flies that experienced ejaculation is most likely
not related to the role of Crz neurons in promoting ethanol sensi-
tivity [38]. In addition, brain Crz neurons express the fructose
receptor Gr43a that functions as a nutrient sensor for hemo-
lymph fructose levels, assigning positive valence for feeding dur-
ing starvation and negative valence for feeding when flies are
satiated [42, 43]. Still, the activation of brain Crz/Gr43a neurons
in satiated male flies was neutral in all the reward-related assays,
suggesting that under the conditions used in this study, they do
not function in encoding reward.
Our findings exemplify the similarities in the principles that
govern processing of natural rewards from flies to mammals,
as the role of ejaculation in reinforcing mating experience is
conserved [3]. In rodents, however, female pheromones can
also carry positive valence and induce conditioned place
preference [44]. Ejaculation in rodents is mediated by the spinal
control center (spinal ejaculation generator), which integrates
sensory inputs and coordinates the sympathetic, parasympa-
thetic, and somatic outflow during intercourse while relaying
the information to the brain [3, 45–49]. Furthermore, there is a
resemblance in the crosstalk between natural and drug rewards
between mammals and flies, where rodents show increased
sensitization to amphetamine reward after periods of abstinence
from sexual experience [50], and sexually deprived male flies
show increased motivation to consume ethanol [5]. In flies,
although we showed a functional link between Crz/Crz-receptor
neurons promoting SSFR and the reward systems, it is still not
clear which of the ejaculation-related processes is the actual
reward stimulus—the activity of Crz-receptor neurons or sensory
mechanisms downstream of ejaculation. Further investigation
is required to elucidate the neuronal mechanism that relays the
information about successful copulation from the ejaculation
organs to NPF neurons within the fly brain.

 EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS
Drosophila melanogaster strains were raised on standard media (cornmeal, yeast, molasses, and agar) at 25�C, 60%–70%
relative humidity and under a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Flies used for behavioral assays were backcrossed for six generations to
the w Canton-S genetic background. All behavioral experiments used 3- to 4-day-old flies. CRZ-Gal4, CRZ-R-Gal4 and CRZ 2fa-Gal4
flies were kindly provided by David J. Anderson [5]. UAS-Kir2.1 flies were obtained from the Drosophila Stock Center in Bloomington,
Illinois. UAS-csChrimson flies were kindly provided by Vivek Jayaraman, UAS-UNC84-GFP were kindly provided by Gilbert. L. Henry,
UAS-mCD8-GFP flies were obtained from HHMI Janelia Research Campus.
METHOD DETAILS
All behavioral observations were performed in a controlled behavior chamber at temperature of 25�C, 70% humidity. In all activation
assays, flies were reared on trans-retinal-containing media (0.4mM/ml) and were kept in the dark.
Optogenetic-mediated positional preference assay
Two choice positional preference experiments were performed in a custom-built behavioral setup (Figure 1A) that consists of an
arena with 6 lanes, each 16 cm long, 1 cm wide and 3 mm high. The arena was positioned over IR back lighting and red LEDs
(650 nm 0.6 lm @20mA) over a diffuser. Experimental flies expressing csChrimson in Crz/Crz-receptor neurons and genetic controls
were collected upon eclosion in groups of 10 flies/vial and kept under dark conditions. At the day of the experiment, flies were
inserted into the experimental arena and allowed to acclimate for 10 minutes. At the end of the acclimation phase, the apparatus
was gently agitated (startled) to evoke the flies’ locomotor behavior. The position of the flies was recorded for five min under dark
conditions (in the presence of IR backlighting), followed by 5 min recording when half of the arena was illuminated by red LEDs
(40 Hz, 650nm, 0.6 lm @20mA). The flies were gently startled between the phases to promote active locomotion and choice between
the zones. The behavior was recorded using high-definition point gray cameras (1080 3 720 pixels) at 30fps and analyzed using
CTRAX tracking algorithm. Positional preference to the illuminated zone was calculated according to the following equation: (number
of flies in the illuminated zone – number of flies in the dark zone) / number of total flies. Results are an average of 10 flies/lane over a
total of 12 lanes/genotype. The specification of the arena is provided in Figure S1. The positional preference results were normally
distributed in all experiments.
Activation of Crz neurons for further mRNA processing or ethanol consumption
Light induced activation of red shifted Channel Rhodopsin UAS-CsCrimson was achieved by placing glass fly vials containing 5 flies
each over red LEDs (40 Hz, 650nm, 0.6 lm @20mA). Activation protocol consisted of 3x15 min-long activation periods for CRZ-Gal4
and 3x5 for CRZ-R-Gal4 spaced by 45/55 min resting intervals for 4 consecutive days (RT PCR experiments), or for 3 days (ethanol
consumption assays).
Mating experience
Virgin experimental and control males were individually mated with 3 virgin females over the course of 3 h a day for 4 consecutive
days. Virgin flies of each genotype served as the control. At the end of the last mating session (day 4). Only male flies that successfully
mated throughout all days of the experiment were frozen processed further for relative npf transcript level.
Capillary feeder assay (CAFE)
Ethanol consumption assays were performed as previously described [34]. Briefly, at the end of the activation protocols, flies were
given the choice to feed from four capillaries filled with liquid food with or without 15% ethanol supplementation, which was
measured over the course of three days. Each tested genotype was placed in groups of eight flies/vial, with the total of 8 vial/geno-
type. Empty vials served to assess evaporation rates. Preference index (PI) was calculated by subtracting the consumption of food
without ethanol from the consumption of food containing ethanol divided by the sum of total consumption. The preference index
results were normally distributed in all experiments.
Olfactory conditioning assay
The assay was carried out as described previously [21]. The olfactory cues were 4-methylcyclohexanol (MCH, Sigma-Aldrich) and
3-octanol (OCT, Sigma-Aldrich). Groups of 25 flies were loaded into a round arena with four quadrants that could be illuminated
by 617-nm LEDs at 20 mW/mm2 and perfused with different odor independently. In a training session, flies were sequentially exposed
to 1 min of air, 45 s of odor A (activation-unassociated conditioned stimulus, CS-), 1 min of air, 45 s of odor B (activation-associated
conditioned stimulus, CS+) paired with LED illumination, and another 2 min of air. Memory was tested immediately after the last air
exposure; odor A and B were delivered to each pair of opposing quadrants for 3 min and distribution of flies in the last 2 minutes of the
test session was used to calculate a performance-index (PI), which was defined as:
PIðiÞ = ð# flies CS + quadrants ­ # flies CS­ quadrantÞ=# flies total:
To exclude flies’ innate odor bias, the average PI of flies trained with reciprocal odors as CS+ was presented in the results.

 Immunostaining
Whole-mount brains and VNC were fixed over night in 1% paraformaldehyde. Preparations were blocked for 1 hour at 4�C with gentle
agitation in 0.5% BSA, 0.3% Triton in PBS. The following primary antibody dilutions were used: rabbit a-NPF Rabbit (RB-19-0001)
1:500, Rabbit anti GFP (LifeTech 1:500), the neuropile-specific antibody NC82, (1:50, The Jackson Laboratory), and mouse a-GFP
(1:200, Roche). Secondary antibodies, a-mouse-Alexa488 (1:200), a-rabbit-Alexa568 (1:200), a-mouse-Alexa568 (1:200) and a-rab-
bit-Alexa488 (1:200) were incubated overnight at 4�C. The stained samples were mounted with Vectashield and visualized using a
Leica SP8 confocal microscope.
QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Real time PCR analysis
Fly samples from activation or mating experiments were frozen in liquid nitrogen and vortexed to separate heads from bodies. Each
sample, consisting of 15-17 frozen heads, was used for total RNA using TRIzol reagent (Ambion). 1 mg RNA was further used for cDNA
synthesis (iScript, Biorad). Quantitative PCR using SYBR green (SYBR Green master mix, Biorad) was performed using BIORAD
CFX96 Real-Time PCR machine with the following conditions: initial denaturation for 3 min at 95�C, then amplification for 15 min
at 95�C, 30 min at 59�C, 30 min at 72�C for 39 cycles. npf transcript levels were analyzed by DDCT method using rpl32 as an internal
control. Each sample was run in triplicates. Each experiment was repeated three time using independent sets of genetic crosses,
each consisting of 15-20 fly heads. Unpaired Student’s t tests were used to compare two sets of data and corrected for multiple
comparison. Primers used for RT-PCR quantification:
npf Primers Forward: CCTCATTAAAACGCGAGCAAAT
npf Reverse: ATCGCTGATGGATATCCTGAGG.
Statistical analysis
For RT-qPCR experiments, the average relative expression of three independent experiments (every sample within each repeat con-
sisted of 15 flies), were analyzed using Two-Sample t test (Student’s t test) for two groups (Figure 3A), or by using One-Way ANOVA
with Tukey post hoc analysis to test the fold change in relative expression (Figures 3B–3D and 4E). Behavioral experiments were
analyzed using several methods: for optogenetic-mediated positional preference assay, average positional preference was calcu-
lated by averaging the values of preference across 900 frames in 12 arenas per genotype. one-sample two-sided t tests (with Bon-
ferroni correction) was performed to test the alternative hypothesis: if average PI for the last minute of the assay for each condition is
significantly different than zero. This analysis was followed by two-way ANOVA (with post hoc Bonferroni correction) with the con-
dition (light/dark) as a within-subjects factor and genotype as a between-subjects factor to test for preference. All statistical analyses
were performed in R (Figures 1C–1K). For capillary feeder assay, a two-way ANOVA with day as a within-subjects factor was per-
formed to test the effect of genotype on ethanol preference index. Mean estimates were extracted from ANOVA model and tested
against the alternative hypothesis that the average preference index is different than zero (Figures 3E–3G). For olfactory conditioning
assay Mann Whitney was used to compare conditioned odor preference values under light and dark conditions (Figures 2B and 2C).
