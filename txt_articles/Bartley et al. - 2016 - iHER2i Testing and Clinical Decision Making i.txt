ABSTRACT
Context: ERBB2 (erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 or HER2)
is currently the only biomarker established for selection of a
specific therapy for patients with advanced gastroesophageal
adenocarcinoma (GEA). However, there are no comprehensive
guidelines for the assessment of HER2 in patients with GEA.
Objectives: To establish an evidence-based guideline for
HER2 testing in patients with GEA, to formalize the algorithms
for methods to improve the accuracy of HER2 testing while ad-
dressing which patients and tumor specimens are appropriate,
and to provide guidance on clinical decision making.
Design: The College of American Pathologists, American
Society for Clinical Pathology, and American Society of Clinical
Oncology convened an expert panel to conduct a systematic re-
view of the literature to develop an evidence-based guideline with
recommendations for optimal HER2 testing in patients with GEA.
Results: The panel is proposing 11 recommendations with
strong agreement from the open-comment participants.
Recommendations: The panel recommends that tumor spe-
cimen(s) from all patients with advanced GEA, who are can-
didates for HER2-targeted therapy, should be assessed for
HER2 status before the initiation of HER2-targeted therapy.
Clinicians should offer combination chemotherapy and a
HER2-targeted agent as initial therapy for all patients with
HER2-positive advanced GEA. For pathologists, guidance
is provided for morphologic selection of neoplastic tissue,
testing algorithms, scoring methods, interpretation and re-
porting of results, and laboratory quality assurance.
Conclusions: This guideline provides specific recommenda-
tions for assessment of HER2 in patients with advanced
GEA while addressing pertinent technical issues and clin-
ical implications of the results.

AJCP / REVIEW ARTICLE
Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/ajcp/article-abstract/146/6/647/2681820 by guest on 05 June 2019
 Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) is estimated
to represent up to 43,280 cancer cases in the United States in
20161 and represents the eighth (esophageal) and fifth (stom-
ach) most common cancers worldwide.2 Gastroesophageal
adenocarcinoma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, re-
sulting in a poor prognosis. Most localized GEAs (stages II
and III) are best treated with multimodality therapy, which
can result in a 5-year survival in �40% of patients; however,
once GEA is advanced (defined as unresectable local-
regional, recurrent, or metastatic disease), therapies are lim-
ited and palliative, with cure being extremely rare.
In 2010, results of an open-label, international, phase 3
randomized controlled trial (Trastuzumab for Gastric Cancer
[ToGA]), showed that the anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal
antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin; Genentech, San Francisco,
CA) statistically significantly prolonged overall survival,
compared with chemotherapy alone, in patients with HER2-
positive advanced GEA.3 ERBB2 (also commonly known as
HER2) is a proto-oncogene located on chromosome 17 that
encodes a 185-kDa tyrosine kinase receptor belonging to the
epidermal growth factor receptor family whose phosphoryl-
ation initiates signaling pathways that lead to cell division,
proliferation, differentiation, and antiapoptosis signaling.4,5
Past investigations have estimated that between 7% and 38%
of
GEAs
have
amplification
and/or
overexpression
of
HER2.3,6,7
The frequency of overexpression of HER2 is slightly
greater for cancers at the gastroesophageal junction in com-
parison to the stomach,3,8-10 and overexpression in the stom-
ach varies with histologic type (intestinal type greater than
diffuse type) and differentiation (well and moderately differ-
entiated greater than poorly differentiated).11 In comparison
to breast carcinomas, the heterogeneity of immunostaining is
greater in GEA,9,12 and the completeness of membrane stain-
ing required for positivity in mammary neoplastic cells is in-
frequent in GEA and often expression is seen in a basolateral
pattern. Hofmann et al13 proposed a four-tier HER2 scoring
system, also used in the ToGA trial, for GEA by applying an
assessment area cutoff of at least 10% stained tumor cells for
resection specimens and a small single cluster of cells (or at
least five cells) for biopsy specimens.
Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that
targets the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor, inhibits
downstream
signal
activation,
and
induces
antibody-
dependent cellular toxicity. The literature on HER2 as a prog-
nostic factor for patients with GEA is conflicting; not all stud-
ies have shown an association between HER2 overexpression
and poor prognosis in GEA.13,14 The National Comprehensive
Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology
(NCCN Guidelines) for Gastric Cancer and Esophageal and
Esophagogastric Junction Cancers recommend assessment of
HER2 overexpression using immunohistochemistry (IHC)
and/or gene amplification using fluorescence in situ hybridiza-
tion (FISH) or another in situ hybridization (ISH) method in
tumor samples from patients with unresectable locally
advanced, recurrent, or metastatic GEA for whom trastuzu-
mab may be potentially beneficial.11,15 Testing for HER2 is
primarily performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded
(FFPE) biopsy or resection tumor tissue from the primary or
metastatic site.
In 2007, a joint expert panel convened by the American
Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) and the College of
American Pathologists (CAP) met to develop guidelines for
when and how to test for HER2 in patients with breast can-
cer, which is amplified and/or overexpressed in up to 30% of
cases.16 In 2012, ASCO and CAP convened an Update
Committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the peer-
reviewed literature published since 2006 and to revise the
guideline recommendations. The Update Committee de-
veloped new algorithms for testing and recommended qual-
ity assurance monitoring that would make HER2 testing less
variable and ensure more analytic consistency among
laboratories.17
Because there are important distinct differences in
HER2 expression, scoring, and outcomes in GEA relative to
breast carcinoma, the need for HER2 guidelines (that in-
clude critical clinical and laboratory considerations) was
recognized. The CAP, American Society for Clinical
Pathology (ASCP), and ASCO convened an international
expert panel to systematically review published documents
and to develop an evidence-based guideline to establish rec-
ommendations for HER2 testing in GEA.
Panel Composition
The CAP Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center,
ASCP, and ASCO convened an international expert panel
consisting of practicing pathologists, oncologists, and a gastro-
enterologist with expertise and experience in GEA. Members
included practicing clinicians and pathologists from the
United States, Canada, and Europe. The CAP, ASCP, and
ASCO approved the appointment of the project, cochairs, and
expert panel members. In addition, a physician-methodologist
experienced in systematic review and guideline development
consulted with the panel throughout the project, and a patient
advocate also participated to convey the patient experience.
Conflict of Interest Policy
Before appointment to the expert panel, potential mem-
bers completed a joint conflict of interest (COI) disclosure
process whose policy and form require disclosure of

nificant value from, the guideline’s development or its rec-
ommendations. The potential members completed the COI
disclosure form, listing any relationship that could be inter-
preted as constituting an actual, potential, or apparent conflict.
Potential conflicts were managed by the cochairs. All mem-
bers were required to disclose conflicts before beginning the
project and then continuously throughout the project’s time-
line. Disclosed conflicts of the expert panel members are
listed
Appendix 1 . The CAP, ASCP, and ASCO provided
funding for the administration of the project; no industry fund-
ing was involved in any aspect of the development of this
guideline. All panel members volunteered their time and were
not compensated for their involvement. Please see the supple-
mental digital content (SDC) for details on the COI policy.

of Clinical Pathology online.)
Objective
The panel addressed the overarching questions “What
is the optimal testing algorithm for the assessment of HER2
status in patients with GEA?” and “What strategies can help
ensure optimal performance, interpretation, and reporting of
established assays in patients with GEA?”
This led to the following additional questions:
1. Should HER2 testing be performed in every patient
diagnosed with GEA?
2. Which tumor specimen(s) is(are) the most appropriate
to perform HER2 testing?
3. In patients with HER2-positive results, under what
clinical scenario should HER2-targeted therapy be
initiated?
4. Should HER2-directed therapy be delayed if HER2
status cannot be confirmed as positive or negative (ie,
if an equivocal result is found with IHC)?
5. Under what circumstances should a patient’s tumor
specimen be retested for HER2?
6. What are the clinical performance characteristics of
IHC and ISH?
7. What are the analytic performance characteristics of
IHC and ISH?
8. What are the acceptable methodologies for HER2 IHC
(different antibodies) and ISH (different probe platforms)?
9. What is the optimal testing algorithm for the assess-
ment of HER2 status?
10. What are the steps/procedures needed to analytically
validate a laboratory-developed HER2 GEA assay be-
fore reporting results on patient tumor specimen(s)?
11. What is the best scoring method for IHC and ISH in
GEA specimens?
12. How should HER2 results be reported?
13. What is adequate tumor specimen handling for HER2
testing?
14. What is the appropriate morphologic correlation for in-
terpretation of ISH?
15. What are the optimal quality assurance/quality control
standards that all HER2 testing laboratories should ad-
here to?
16. Is there a role for HER2 genomic testing?
Materials and Methods
A detailed account of the methods used to create this
guideline can be found in the SDC, including additional
scope questions.
Systematic Literature Review and Analysis
A systematic literature search was completed for rele-
vant evidence by using OvidSP, PubMed, and Scopus
(January 1, 2008, to June 1, 2015). The search strategy
included medical subject headings (MeSH) and text words
to capture the general concepts of gastroesophageal neo-
plasms, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2/
HER2), targeted therapy, and laboratory testing methods.
Database searches were supplemented with a search for un-
indexed literature, including a review of clinical trials and
pertinent organizations’ websites. All searches were limited
to human studies. Expert panel recommendations and a re-
view of reference lists of included articles for relevant re-
ports completed the systematic literature review. Detailed
information regarding the literature search strategy can be
found in the SDC.
Eligible Study Designs
Eligible study designs were determined a priori on the
basis of whether they were clinical or laboratory-based stud-
ies. Clinical studies were included if they were systematic
reviews with or without meta-analyses, guidelines, consen-
sus statements, or randomized controlled trials (except for
phase I trials). Additional study types were included for
laboratory-based studies owing to concern that relevant data
would not otherwise be captured. Detailed information
about included study designs is available in the SDC.
Inclusion Criteria
Published studies were selected for inclusion in the sys-
tematic review of evidence if they met the following crite-
ria: (1) the study included human patients; (2) the study
population consisted of patients with invasive GEA; (3) the
study was published in English; (4) the study compared,

ive value or positive predictive value of ISH and IHC assays
used to determine HER2 status, alone and in combination;
negative and positive concordance across the platforms;
sensitivity and specificity of individual tests; and accuracy
in determining HER2 status. Detailed information about the
inclusion criteria is available in the SDC.
Exclusion Criteria
Articles were excluded from the systematic review if
they were meeting abstracts that were not published in peer
review journals; noncomparative or qualitative studies,
including editorials, commentaries, and letters; animal stud-
ies; full-text articles not available in English; studies that
included patients with other tumor types, including esopha-
geal squamous cell carcinoma, or patients with noninvasive
tumors; studies that did not include relevant measurable
data; and studies that did not address at least one of the key
questions. Detailed information about the exclusion criteria
is available in the SDC.
Quality Assessment
Study design aspects related to individual study quality,
strength of evidence, strength of recommendations, and the
risk of bias were assessed. Refer to the SDC for more infor-
mation and for definitions of ratings for overall potential
risk of bias.
Assessing the Strength of Recommendations
The guideline recommendations were crafted, in part,
by using the GLIDES (Guidelines Into Decision Support)
methodology18 and accompanying BridgeWiz software
(Yale University, New Haven, CT).19 Development of rec-
ommendations required that the panel review and identify
evidence and make a series of key judgments (using proced-
ures described in SDC). In addition, the expert panel gave
its recommendations with regard to potential clinical impact
by assessing benefits and harms for each recommendation
and then rated the quality of evidence for the recommenda-
tions as high, intermediate, low, or insufficient. The
Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development,
and Evaluation, or GRADE method,20 was used to rate the
quality of the evidence. CAP uses a three-tier system to rate
the strength of recommendations instead of the traditional
two-tier approach of strong or weak recommendations. This
approach is consistent with prior CAP guidelines Table 1
and Table 2 .
Guideline Revision
This guideline will be reviewed every 4 years, or earlier
in the event of publication of substantive and high-quality
evidence that could potentially alter the original recommen-
dations. If necessary, the entire panel will be reconvened to
discuss potential changes. When appropriate, the panel will
recommend revision(s) of the guideline to CAP, ASCP, and
ASCO for review and approval.
Disclaimer
The CAP developed the Pathology and Laboratory
Quality Center as a forum to create and maintain evidence-
based
practice
guidelines
and
consensus
statements.
Practice guidelines and consensus statements reflect the
best available evidence and expert consensus supported in
practice. They are intended to assist physicians and patients
in clinical decision making and to identify questions and set-
tings for further research. With the rapid flow of scientific
information, new evidence may emerge between the time a
practice guideline or consensus statement is developed and
when it is published or read. Guidelines and statements are
not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent
evidence. Guidelines and statements address only the
topics specifically identified therein and are not applicable
to other interventions, diseases, or stages of diseases.
Furthermore, guidelines and consensus statements cannot
account for individual variation among patients and cannot
be considered inclusive of all proper methods of care or ex-
clusive of other treatments. It is the responsibility of the
treating physician or other health care provider, relying on
independent experience and knowledge, to determine the
best course of treatment for the patient. Accordingly, ad-
herence to any practice guideline or consensus statement is
voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding its
application to be made by the physician in light of each

Results
A total of 969 studies met the search term require-
ments. A total of 116 articles were included for data ex-
traction. This consisted of one systematic review, two
meta-analyses, two randomized controlled trials, 27 pro-
spective studies, 69 prospective-retrospective studies, and
15 retrospective studies. Excluded articles were available
as discussion or background references. The expert panel
met face-to-face on April 25, 2015, to develop the scope
and the key questions and, on August 29, 2015, to draft
recommendations and assess the quality of evidence. The
panel met a total of 16 times via web conference in small
groups to review solicited feedback and finalize the rec-
ommendations. A nominal group technique was used by
the panel for consensus decision making to encourage
unique input with balanced participation among the group
members.
An
open-comment
period
was
held
from
December 8, 2015, to January 11, 2016, during which
draft recommendations were posted on the ASCP website.
Twenty recommendations were drafted with strong agree-
ment for each recommendation from the open-comment-
period participants ranging from 82% to 95% (refer to
Outcomes in SDC for full details). The website received a
total of 294 comments.
Teams of two expert panel members were assigned to
two key questions and three to four draft recommendations
to review all the comments received and provide an overall
summary to the rest of the panel. Following panel discus-
sions and the final quality of evidence assessment, the panel
members determined whether to maintain the original draft
recommendations as is or revise them with major content
changes. The panel modified one draft recommendation and
combined four draft recommendations from the feedback
during the open-comment period and the considered judg-
ment process. In addition, the panel decided that general
recommendations about quality assurance, turnaround time,
and specimen handling were best suited as part of the dis-
cussion and would be included in the body of the final
manuscript
rather
than
as
formal
recommendations.
Resolution of all changes was obtained by majority consen-
sus of the panel, using nominal group technique (rounds of
email discussion and multiple edited recommendations)
among the panel members. The expert panel with a formal
vote approved the final recommendations. The panel con-
sidered the risks and benefits throughout the entire process
in their considered judgment process. Formal cost analysis
or cost effectiveness was not performed. A summary of the
final guideline statements and strength of recommendation
is shown in Table 3 .
Each organization instituted a review process to ap-
prove the guideline. The CAP convened an independent re-
view panel representing the Council for Scientific Affairs to
review and approve the guideline. The independent review
panel was masked to the expert panel and vetted through the
COI process. ASCP assigned the review of the guideline to
a Special Review Panel at the discretion of the ASCP
Executive Office and Board of Directors. The ASCO ap-
proval process required the review and approval of the
Clinical Practice Guidelines Committee.

 Guideline Statements
1. Strong Recommendation. In patients with advanced
GEA who are potential candidates for HER2-targeted ther-
apy, the treating clinician should request HER2 testing on
tumor tissue.
(Quality of evidence: High; Strength of recommenda-
tion: Strong)
All patients who have documented advanced GEA and
who are considered good candidates for combination
chemotherapy plus trastuzumab therapy should have their
tumor tissue tested for HER2 overexpression and/or amplifi-
cation. In patients with HER2-positive GEA, the addition of
trastuzumab
can
increase
the
response
rate,
prolong
progression-free survival, and prolong overall survival.
Other than providing guidance to the addition of trastuzu-
mab to cytotoxic combination (when the tumor is HER2
positive), HER2 status provides little additional value such
as prognostic or predictive information. Currently, there is
no evidence of benefit of HER2-directed therapy in patients
without advanced GEA.
In the ToGA trial, patients were randomly assigned to
receive capecitabine plus cisplatin or fluorouracil plus cis-
platin in combination with trastuzumab.3,8 Of the 3,803
patients originally screened for eligibility, 810 patients had
IHC or FISH HER2-positive tumors, but only 594 patients
were randomly assigned to treatment. The HER2 positivity
rate was 22.1%, with similar rates between European and
Asian patients (23.6% vs 23.9%). The eligible patients
included those with advanced adenocarcinoma of the stom-
ach or gastroesophageal junction, Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2, ad-
equate organ function, and measurable or nonmeasurable
disease. Patients were ineligible if they had congestive heart
failure, baseline left ventricular ejection fraction less than
50%, transmural myocardial infarction, uncontrolled hyper-
tension (systolic blood pressure >180 mm Hg or diastolic
blood pressure >100 mm Hg), angina pectoris requiring
medication, clinically significant valvular heart disease,
high-risk arrhythmias, lack of physical integrity of the upper
gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption syndrome, active
gastrointestinal bleeding, and evidence of brain metastases.
The median overall survival was 13.8 months for patients
receiving trastuzumab plus chemotherapy, compared with
11.1 months for those receiving chemotherapy alone (haz-
ard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-
0.91; P ¼ .0038). Patients with IHC of 3þ derived more
benefit than those with IHC of 2þ (and concurrent HER2
Table 3
Guideline Statements and Strength of Recommendation
Guideline Statement
CAP Strength of
Recommendation
1. In patients with GEA who are potential candidates for HER2-targeted therapy, the treating clinician should
request HER2 testing on tumor tissue.
Strong recommendation
2. Treating clinicians or pathologist should request HER2 testing on tumor tissue in the biopsy or resection
specimens (primary or metastasis) preferably before the initiation of trastuzumab therapy if such specimens
are available and adequate. HER2 testing on FNA specimens (cell blocks) is an acceptable alternative.
Recommendation
3. Treating clinicians should offer combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted therapy as the initial treatment
for appropriate patients with HER2-positive tumors who have metastatic or recurrent GEA.
Recommendation
4. Laboratories/pathologists must specify the antibodies and probes used for the test and ensure that assays are
appropriately validated for HER2 IHC and ISH on GEA specimens.
Strong recommendation
5. When GEA HER2 status is being evaluated, laboratories/pathologists should perform/order IHC testing first
followed by ISH when the IHC result is 2 þ (equivocal). Positive (3þ) or negative (0 or 1þ) HER2 IHC results do
not require further ISH testing.
Strong recommendation
6. Pathologists should use the Ruschoff/Hofmann method in scoring HER2 IHC and ISH results for GEA.
Strong recommendation
7. Pathologists should select the tissue block with the areas of lowest grade tumor morphology in biopsy and
resection specimens. More than one tissue block may be selected if different morphologic patterns are present.
Recommendation
8. Laboratories should report HER2 testing results in GEA specimens in accordance with the CAP “Template for
Reporting Results of HER2 (ERBB2) Biomarker Testing of Specimens From Patients With Adenocarcinoma of
the Stomach or Esophagogastric Junction.”
Strong recommendation
9. Pathologists should identify areas of invasive adenocarcinoma and also mark areas with strongest intensity of
HER2 expression by IHC in GEA specimens for subsequent ISH scoring when required.
Strong recommendation
10. Laboratories must incorporate GEA HER2 testing methods into their overall laboratory quality improvement
program, establishing appropriate quality improvement monitors as needed to ensure consistent performance
in all steps of the testing and reporting process. In particular, laboratories performing GEA HER2 testing must
participate in a formal proficiency testing program, if available, or an alternative proficiency assurance activity.
Strong recommendation
11. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against genomic testing in patients with GEA at this time.
No recommendation

 amplification by ISH). However, upon further follow-up of
these patients, reanalyses demonstrated considerable reduc-
tion in patient benefit from the addition of trastuzumab
(HR, 0.8; 95% CI, 0.67-0.97; P ¼ .019). The difference in
the median survival diminished to a mere 1.4 months.21
The cardiac adverse event rate was low (6%) and did
not differ between the treatment groups. Trastuzumab was
generally well tolerated, but the patients assigned to trastu-
zumab experienced slightly higher rates of diarrhea, stoma-
titis, anemia, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, and weight loss,
but there was no difference between the groups in frequency
of side effects or grade 3 or 4 toxicities, except for diarrhea.
The NCCN Guidelines recommend systemic therapy, clin-
ical trial participation, or palliative management for patients
with a Karnofsky performance score greater or equal to 60%,
or an ECOG performance score less than or equal to 2, and that
trastuzumab should be added to active first-line combination
chemotherapy for HER2-positive metastatic GEA (although the
ToGA trial combined cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine with
trastuzumab).11 Patients with a Karnofsky performance score
less than 60%, or ECOG performance score greater than or
equal to 3, are best managed with best supportive care.
Although the literature regarding HER2 as a prognostic
marker is conflicting, some studies6,22-24 have demonstrated
that HER2 amplification or overexpression in GEA may be
associated with a worse prognosis and is independent of
other prognostic factors, including age, sex, location, or
stage. We briefly review only two large and representative
studies that failed to correlate HER2 status with prognosis.
A retrospective study of 1,006 Japanese patients with gastric
cancer established HER2 overexpression in 11.7% of
cases.25 The HER2 status correlated with age, sex, grade,
growth pattern, and nodal status; however, HER2 overex-
pression did not correlate with disease-specific survival or
recurrence-free survival. Likewise, a combined analysis of
924 German and British patients who had undergone surgi-
cal resection demonstrated HER2 expression in less than
10% of tumor specimens with considerable intratumoral
heterogeneity and no relationship between HER2 expres-
sion, patient survival, or stage.26
In summary, the evidence does not support the deter-
mination of HER2 status in patients who have a surgically
resectable GEA, and HER2 status is not useful to prognosti-
cate survival or similar end points. However, for patients
with advanced GEA with a good performance status, low
cardiac risk, and who would otherwise be candidates for
systemic therapy, including trastuzumab, HER2 testing
should be performed and patients should be offered trastu-
zumab if GEA is HER2 positive.
2. Recommendation. Treating clinicians or pathologists
should request HER2 testing on tumor tissue in the biopsy
or resection specimens (primary or metastasis), preferably
before the initiation of trastuzumab therapy if such speci-
mens are available and adequate. HER2 testing on fine-
needle aspiration (FNA) specimens (cell blocks) is an ac-
ceptable alternative.

Tumor Specimens From the Primary GEA
Primary tumor specimens obtained either by biopsy or
resection represent the principal sample type for assessment
of HER2 status in a number of larger analyses that have
included patients with resectable GEA. Of the 115 patient
biopsy or resection specimens tested for HER2 in the
MAGIC (Medical Research Council Adjuvant Gastric
Cancer Infusional Chemotherapy) trial, there was 92.9%
(145 of 156) concordance between the two types of speci-
mens.27 In the ToGA trial, 2,596 (68%) patients’ tumors
were acquired by a biopsy, and 1,199 (32%) patients’
tumors were acquired from the surgical specimens. Of these,
579 biopsy specimens were HER2 positive, and 231 of the
surgical specimens were HER2 positive. Overall positive
rate was 23.2% for biopsy specimens and 19.7% for the sur-
gical specimens. Of note, there was significant variability in
staining intensities across tissue sections.8
In another collaborative effort on 381 patients with
advanced GEA, 20% had HER2-positive tumors with higher
rates in those with liver metastases and intestinal hist-
ology.28 There was no difference in HER2 positivity be-
tween resections/biopsies of primary (biopsies 21% vs
resection 19%, P ¼ .791) or metastatic disease and no asso-
ciation with prognosis. In another study of 178 patients with
GEA, there were 64 biopsy specimens and 60 gastrectomy
specimens for HER2 testing. The overall positivity rate was
20.2%. There was a significantly higher percentage of pa-
tients with HER2 3þ expression in biopsy specimens than
in gastrectomy specimens (31.2% vs 8.8%, P ¼ .0003);
however, the concordance of overall HER2 status was
74.1% between biopsy and gastrectomy specimens. The bi-
opsy specimens also included a higher proportion of
intestinal-type tumors (70.3% vs 48.2%, P ¼ .003).
Tumor Specimens From Resected GEA
In a Japanese study,29 207 surgically resected tumors
and paired biopsy specimens from 158 patients with
intestinal-type gastric cancers were analyzed for HER2
overexpression/amplification.
In
both
specimen
types,
HER2 overexpression was observed in 17% of cases,
whereas gene amplification was detected in 31% of the sur-
gically resected tumors and 32% of biopsy specimens.

 surgically resected tumors and 90.2% in biopsy specimens.
There was a 72.7% concordance rate of FISH between the
surgical and biopsy specimens.29 Another analysis of endo-
scopic biopsy compared with surgical samples in evaluating
HER2 status in GEA included 103 patients with matched spe-
cimens.30 The concordance of IHC between biopsy and surgi-
cal samples was 80% and 95%, respectively. An Italian
analysis of 61 consecutive pairs of biopsy specimens and sur-
gical specimens noted a concordance of HER2 status of
91.8%.12 Heterogeneous expression of HER2 protein in surgi-
cal specimens accounted for false-negative cases. In conclu-
sion, limited studies have compared matched pairs of biopsy
vs resection specimen(s) for HER2 expression/amplification,
and the available results suggest a fair degree of concordance.
Tumor Specimens From Metastatic GEA
Multiple groups have investigated the status of HER2
expression in the primary tumor and metastatic lymph nodes
in the same patient.31-35 Qiu et al31 examined 100 gastric
cancers, in both primary tumors and corresponding malig-
nant lymph node metastases, using IHC (scoring according
to the criteria established by Hofmann et al13). HER2 over-
expression (defined in this study as 2þ or 3þ) was noted in
33.0% of primary specimens and 39.4% of the nodes. When
HER2 status was compared in two or more nodes, there was
25.3% discordance. However, in a study that compared
HER2 status in the metastatic lymph nodes with primary
tumor, IHC and silver in situ hybridization (SISH) were
used to compare HER2 status.32 The SISH results were
comparable, with a concordance of 92.5%. The prevalence
of HER2 discordance was significantly higher for tumors in
the pN2 and pN3 categories (P ¼ .007).
Some have compared HER2 status between the pri-
mary tumor specimen and synchronous metastatic speci-
mens. In one such study of 41 paired samples with five
HER2-positive tumors, there was a discrepancy observed in
only one case.36 Another study assessing HER2 status in 68
paired samples showed a 98.5% concordance of FISH re-
sults (n ¼ 68) and 94.9% concordance of IHC results
(n ¼ 39).37 Only one case was discordant, being negative in
the primary tumor but positive in the metastatic peripancre-
atic lymph node. Others38 have also shown good concord-
ance between liver metastases (87.5%) and primary tumor.
Thus, given the high degree of concordance, HER2 testing
on the primary tumor or biopsy specimen from a metastatic
tumor deposit is appropriate.
FNA or Cytology Specimen From Primary
or Metastatic Tumor
There are occasions when resection or biopsy of the pri-
mary tumor or metastases may not be an option. Although
not preferred, HER2 testing performed on the cell block of
an FNA can be considered an alternative. Bozzetti et al37
compared metastatic FNA specimens and noted HER2 amp-
lification in 21% of specimens from the metastatic lesions
sampled by histology and in 9% of cytology specimens.
This difference was not ascribed to a bias of cytology given
that FISH results were entirely concordant with those ob-
tained on the histologic specimens of the corresponding pri-
mary tumors. It is likely that the discrepancy observed
between the HER2-positive cases on cytology and on hist-
ology may be related to the small sample size.
Others39 have assessed HER2 status on specimens ob-
tained from malignant effusions by using both IHC and
SISH. Cell blocks from 46 effusions obtained from patients
with metastatic gastric carcinoma were examined. IHC was
scored with the modified criteria of Hofmann et al.13
Results were compared with histologic specimens to assess
HER2 status concordance. Seven (15%) showed an IHC
2þ/3þ reaction with a membranous pattern. Three (7%)
showed HER2 amplification on SISH. In 18 (39%) cases,
HER2 status was compared with histologic specimens,
showing 100% concordance. The incidence of HER2 posi-
tivity (7% with SISHþ and IHC 2þ/3þ) was lower than re-
ported in histologic samples.
Given the issue of intratumoral heterogeneity in GEA
specimens, testing of multiple biopsy fragments (from a pri-
mary or metastatic site) or from the resected primary tumor
is preferred.13,40 If this is not an option, testing a cytology
specimen from an FNA cell block is acceptable. However,
the specimens obtained in cytology specimens may not be
truly representative given the limited sampling of the tumor.
For biopsy specimens, current recommendations state that,
when possible, a minimum of five biopsy specimens41 and,
optimally, six to eight should be obtained to account for
intratumoral heterogeneity and to provide sufficient tumor
specimens for diagnosis and biomarker testing, and this is
also recommended by the NCCN Guidelines.8,11,42 As well,
if there is concern about the adequacy of the specimen, it is
recommended that additional available primary or meta-
static GEA tumor tissue be tested.
3. Strong Recommendation. Treating clinicians should
offer combination chemotherapy and HER2-targeted ther-
apy as the initial treatment for appropriate patients with
HER2-positive tumors who have advanced GEA.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength
of recommendation: Strong)
HER2-targeted therapy was established in 2010 as a
new standard of care for the first-line treatment of patients
with advanced GEA with HER2-positive tumors. The re-
sults of the ToGA trial (efficacy and safety) have been
described above.3 In addition, health-related quality of life

 (HRQoL) and quality-adjusted time without symptoms of
disease or toxicity (Q-TWiST) were improved for patients
who received trastuzumab, with a prolonged time to 10%
definitive deterioration in all quality of life questionnaire
(QLQ)–C30 and QLQ-STO22 scores and extended Q-
TWiST by 2.42 months, compared with chemotherapy
alone.43 Thus, trastuzumab achieved a level 1 evidence for
overall survival advantage in patients with HER2-positive
advanced GEA in the first-line setting.11,44
In 2010, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
and European Medicines Agency approved trastuzumab in
combination with cisplatin and a fluoropyrimidine (5-fluo-
rouracil or capecitabine) for use in patients with HER2-posi-
tive GEAs. The NCCN Guidelines, however, recommend the
addition of trastuzumab to any active chemotherapy combin-
ation. In addition to the ToGA trial, smaller trials combining
trastuzumab with weekly paclitaxel (in trastuzumab-naive pa-
tients) or capecitabine and oxaliplatin have documented
some efficacy, but these results are supportive and not defini-
tive.45 When adding trastuzumab to a biweekly regimen (eg,
oxaliplatin and a fluoropyrimidine), the loading dose should
be 8 mg/kg and then 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks.
With the establishment of HER2 testing as a standard
of care for patients with advanced GEA, it is important to
note that the treating clinician should not offer HER2-
targeted therapy until HER2 positivity is confirmed. Since
patients with advanced GEA can be symptomatic, it is rec-
ommended to start combination cytotoxic therapy as soon
as feasible while waiting for the establishment of HER2 sta-
tus. This statement is based on expert opinion and based on
the fact that in the ToGA trial, of 810 patients with HER2-
positive tumors, 216 became ineligible (mainly due to de-
terioration of performance status) while waiting for HER2
test results. Once it is determined that GEA is HER2 posi-
tive, trastuzumab can be added to the chemotherapy com-
bination. There is no documented benefit for starting HER2-
directed treatment in the absence of confirmed HER2 posi-
tivity, and there is an added potential for the patient to incur
unnecessary side effects or costs. It is also recommended
that if there is documentation of a HER2-positive result in
any specimen (primary or metastatic tumor), the treating
clinician does not need to request additional HER2 testing
on additional tumor specimens. Conversely, if there is no
documentation of a HER2-positive result and there is no
available tumor tissue, an attempt should be made to collect
additional neoplastic tissue (primary or metastatic) for
HER2 testing. In addition, there is currently no evidence to
support repeating HER2 testing after evidence of progres-
sion following HER2-directed therapy (trastuzumab) com-
bined with cytotoxic combination, and there is no evidence
to support continuation of trastuzumab beyond progression
in patients with GEA. In this regard, the TyTAN trial ran-
domly assigned 262 patients with advanced HER2-ampli-
fied gastric adenocarcinoma, in the second-line setting, to
lapatinib plus paclitaxel or paclitaxel alone and reported no
advantage in overall survival for patients randomly assigned
to lapatinib.46 In addition, the LOGiC trial that randomly as-
signed 545 patients with HER2-amplified advanced GEA to
lapatinib or placebo plus capecitabine and oxaliplatin, in the
first-line setting, demonstrated no overall survival advan-
tage for patients who received lapatinib over those who
received placebo.47 Therefore, the efficacy of HER2-
directed therapy is demonstrated by trastuzumab only re-
stricted to the first-line setting. An algorithm for clinicians
for HER2 testing in patients with GEA is presented in
Figure 1 .

 In summary, randomized clinical data support the use
of HER2-targeted therapy in combination with chemother-
apy for patients who are fit and able to tolerate treatment.
Addition of HER2-targeted therapy in patients with HER2-
positive GEA results in improved survival and quality of
life. Trastuzumab provides modest overall survival benefit
for patients with HER2-positive advanced GEA in the first-
line setting in combination with active cytotoxics.
4.
Strong
Recommendation.
Laboratories/pathologists
must specify the antibodies and probes used for the test and
ensure that assays are appropriately validated for HER2
IHC and ISH on GEA specimens.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength
of recommendation: Strong)
Multiple antibodies are available for HER2 IHC (including
but not limited to Ventana 4B5 [Tucson, AZ], Thermo Fisher
Scientific CB11 [Waltham, MA], Sigma-Aldrich SP3 [St Louis,
MO], and Dako AO485 and Dako HercepTest [Glostrup,
Denmark]). Ventana 4B5, Thermo Fisher Scientific CB11, and
Dako HercepTest are FDA approved.48 The ToGA trial3 used
the HercepTest antibody, and many studies30,49-53 have used
4B5 or CB11. There is generally moderate to good concordance
between various antibodies,54-58 although several articles note
stronger staining for 4B5 than for other antibodies. However, no
recommendation is made for the use of a specific antibody.
Likewise, multiple methods for ISH have been eval-
uated for HER2 in GEA. The Dako pharmaDx HER2 FISH
kit was used for the ToGA trial,3 and there is considerable
experience with FISH in testing for HER2 amplification in
breast carcinomas. Development of brightfield ISH technol-
ogies has resulted in several other ISH methods, and one kit
has obtained FDA approval (Dako HER2 FISH pharmDx).
One of these methods is SISH, where either one HER2 slide
or two separate slides are stained for HER2 and chromo-
some enumeration probe (CEP) 17, both using silver as the
chromogen. The other major brightfield ISH methods are
chromogenic ISH and dual ISH, where a nonsilver chromo-
gen alone is used or is used in combination with a silver
chromogen on a separate probe to mark both HER2 and
CEP17 on one slide. The authors of multiple studies52,59-68
agree that these various ISH methods are comparable and
effective for GEA HER2 testing. There have been sugges-
tions that brightfield ISH techniques have some advantages
over FISH in that they can often be performed on automated
stainers, do not require fluorescence microscopes, and allow
for easier identification of tumor nuclei among normal tis-
sues.61,63 However, no recommendation is made regarding
the use of any specific ISH method, as there is no major
diagnostic advantage to one method over another.
While no recommendation regarding which specific
antibody/ISH methodology is given, there is a strong
recommendation regarding validation. If using a method
other than the FDA-approved kit, pathologists and laborato-
ries should carefully validate both IHC and ISH for HER2,
and validation should be performed in the laboratory in
which the assay will be used. The cases used for validation
should be predominantly GEA cases as opposed to other
tumors (ie, breast carcinomas) to allow those scoring to de-
velop and maintain expertise with the different GEA tumor
types and appearances. CAP and/or Clinical Laboratory
Standards Institute guidelines should be followed for assay
validation.69-72
The method of sampling for the validation specimens
(ie, from resections or biopsies) should be similar to those ex-
pected in future sampling and should use the same fixative.
The CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program (ANP.22978)
for HER2 validation for breast carcinomas proposes valid-
ation using 20 positive and 20 negative specimens for an
FDA-approved test and 40 positive/40 negative cases if the
test is a laboratory-developed test.73 If using a brightfield
ISH assay kit, initial validation should be done by compari-
son to an FDA-approved FISH assay.17 Records of validation
must be maintained as per the CAP Laboratory Accreditation
Program
(ANP.22750,
ANP.22978,
and
ANP.22956).73
Laboratories must also maintain good quality control. When
reporting results, the final HER2 test reports should specify
the antibody used for IHC and/or the probe used for ISH
along with a brief description of the kit/methodology.
5. Strong Recommendation. When GEA HER2 status is
being evaluated, laboratories/pathologists should perform/
order IHC testing first followed by ISH when the IHC result
is 2þ (equivocal). Positive (3þ) or negative (0 or 1þ)
HER2 IHC results do not require further ISH testing.
(Quality of evidence: High; Strength of recommenda-
tion: Strong)
The ToGA trial demonstrated that the combination of
trastuzumab plus chemotherapy significantly improved sur-
vival in patients with tumors showing high HER2 expres-
sion.3 The latter was defined as HER2 score 3þ by IHC or
HER2 score 2þ by IHC and HER2 positivity (amplified) by
FISH. HER2-positive results by FISH were observed in
11% of cases with an IHC score of 0 and 12% of cases with
an IHC score of 1þ.3 Similarly, other studies29,74-77 have
shown HER2 positivity by ISH in up to 14% to 24% of
tumors with IHC scores of 0 or 1þ. These patients did not
significantly benefit from the addition of trastuzumab to the
chemotherapy regimen in the ToGA trial.3 Similar findings
were reported in subsequent studies and reviews, demon-
strating that ISH positivity alone does not correlate with re-
sponse to trastuzumab therapy in GEA.8,78
The NCCN Guidelines recommend that specimens with
2þ expression of HER2 by IHC should also be assessed by

 FISH or other ISH method. Specimens with 3þ overexpression
by IHC or FISH positivity (HER2:CEP17 ratio� 2) are con-
sidered positive.11 Specimens having an IHC score of 0 or
1þ are considered negative and do not warrant further
testing. The concordance between IHC 3þ and ISH posi-
tivity was high, with 94% concordance in the ToGA trial
and 62% to 100% in the literature, with most reporting
concordance of 90% or higher.3,8,29,74-78 Since the benefit
from the addition of HER2-directed therapy correlates
with HER2 protein expression, initial HER2 testing
should be performed by IHC. In situ hybridization should
be reserved for IHC 2þ cases. In many studies,8,29,74,76,77
ISH-positive results have been observed in 30% to 50%
of IHC 2þ tumors. Of note, there can be interobserver
variation in the interpretation of HER2 IHC, and the re-
producibility of 1þ and 2þ scores can be low. If the IHC
score is borderline and the distinction between 1þ and
2þ is
challenging,
HER2
ISH
can
be
considered.
However, this approach is not recommended for cases
that show an obvious 1þ IHC score. In most cases, ISH is
not indicated if IHC scores are 0, 1þ, or 3þ. An algorithm
for pathologists for HER2 testing in patients with GEA is
presented in Figure 2 .
6. Strong Recommendation. Pathologists should use the
Ruschoff/Hofmann method in scoring HER2 IHC and ISH
results for GEA.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength
of recommendation: Strong)
The scoring system
Table 4 used in the ToGA trial
and subsequently modified for biopsies has been used in
many studies and has shown excellent correlation between
IHC and gene amplification methods.13,42 The IHC is sub-
jectively scored by using the established criteria on a four-
tiered scale as 0, 1þ, 2þ, and 3þ, with scores of 0 and
1þ considered negative, 3þ as positive, and 2þ as equivo-
cal. Representative examples of IHC in GEA specimens are
shown in
Figure 3 . Similar to breast cancer, only mem-
branous staining, but not cytoplasmic staining, is considered
for HER2 scoring, but unlike breast carcinoma, complete
membranous staining is not required for positivity. Often
the luminal surface of tumor cells fails to stain in HER2neu-
amplified GEA. Only luminal surface staining in the ab-
sence of lateral and basal staining is considered negative.
Assessment of IHC as weak, moderate, or strong for scoring
is similar to that used for breast carcinoma and is subjective
and thus can be a source of intraobserver and interobserver
variability. Scoring using automated image analysis or vir-
tual microscopy can be objective but has not been shown to
improve reproducibility.79 A few studies show good con-
cordance of image analysis with a visual method for scoring
HER2 IHC results; however, at this time, there are limited
data to make a specific recommendation for or against using
image analysis for scoring HER2 in clinical practice.34,79,80

Figure 2 Algorithm for pathologists. Tumor cell cluster is defined as a cluster of five or more tumor cells. Additional recommen-
dations: Pathologists should ensure that biopsy or resection specimens used for HER2 testing are rapidly placed in fixative, ideally
within 1 hour (cold ischemic time), and are fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin for 6 to 72hours. Routine histology processing
and HER2 testing should be performed according to analytically validated protocols. Pathologists should identify areas of invasive
adenocarcinoma and also mark areas with strongest intensity of HER2 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the gastroe-
sophageal adenocarcinoma (GEA) specimen for subsequent scoring when in situ hybridization (ISH) is required.

 Various in situ visualization techniques used to evalu-
ate HER2 amplification include FISH and brightfield ISH
using either HER2 probe or dual HER2 and centromere
(CEP17) probes, and all are acceptable strategies. At least
20 nonoverlapping nuclei of tumor cells are evaluated for
HER2 probe and CEP17 probe signal enumeration Figure 4 .
A ratio of HER2 signal to CEP17 signal of 2.0 or greater is
considered positive, and a ratio of HER2 signal to CEP17
signal below 2.0 is considered negative. To score ISH/FISH
results, first scan the stained slide in all areas designated as
invasive tumor to identify areas with higher level HER2
amplification. In these areas, score both amplified and adja-
cent nonamplified cells that have cytomorphology consist-
ent with malignant cells. Proceed to score in areas marked
as strongest IHC intensity, if this information is available,
since areas of overexpression may signify gene amplifica-
tion in heterogeneous tumors.8,42,81-83 Proceed to other inva-
sive tumor areas until at least 20 cells are scored. Extra
(three or more) copies of CEP17, on average, were noted in
4.1% of gastric cancers in the ToGA trial. This phenomenon
has been referred to as “polysomy” but technically is not
polysomy in many cases, since the entire chromosome is not
duplicated. Rather, the extra copies of CEP17 are due to an
intrachromosomal segmental duplication overlapping the
centromere of chromosome 17, typically also involving the
HER2 gene.84 In such cases, there are often four to six cop-
ies of both HER2 and CEP17 signals with a ratio below 2.0.
If IHC is 2þ and there are three or more CEP17 signals,
on average, with a ratio below 2, then the presence of more
than six HER2 signals, on average, is interpreted as positive
for HER2 amplification by ISH/FISH; fewer than four HER2
signals, on average, is interpreted as negative for HER2 ampli-
fication; and four to six signals, on average, indicates another
20 cells should be scored in a different target area. If additional
scoring does not allow a definitive result to be rendered, then
multiple options are feasible: (1) consultation between scorer
and pathologist regarding selection of malignant cells or tumor
areas for scoring, (2) switching out CEP17 for an alternative
chromosome 17 probe in a retest to calculate the ratio with a
new probe, (3) selecting a different tumor block for HER2
testing, or (4) using genomics or an alternative analytic method
to evaluate HER2 amplification.
Of note, there are currently no definitive studies in the lit-
erature on interpreting monosomy of CEP17 in GEA.
Furthermore, true monosomy for CEP17 is difficult to distin-
guish from truncated cells in thin sections, and there are no
data on how to interpret CEP17 monosomy even if it were con-
firmed by orthogonal methods. Until further data are available,
relying on the ratio of HER2 to CEP17 signals remains a rea-
sonable strategy for analyzing ISH/FISH results.
Each testing laboratory should specify the section thick-
ness required for HER2 ISH/FISH analysis. Section thickness
is especially important for single-probe assays in which abso-
lute counts per cell determine scoring, and is a major reason
why single-probe ISH methods are not recommended. In con-
trast, dual-probe assays are recommended because they rely on
a ratio of HER2 to CEP17 signals, which are less affected by
section thickness. We recommend 4-mm-thick paraffin sections
unless validation studies demonstrate accurate results when
using alternative specimen preparation or if an FDA-approved
kit specifies that another thickness be used. Thinner sections
can yield greater sampling error, fewer cells that qualify for
scoring by virtue of having at least one signal for each of the
two probes, and less intense counterstain. Thicker sections can
lead to the presence of overlapping nuclei and more difficulty
with deparaffinization, protease digestion, and probe or detec-
tion reagent dispersion processes.
The exogenous control slide should be scored to
ensure that the assay protocol performed as expected. In each
patient specimen, ensure adequate staining and counterstaining

 without background interference, overdigestion, or other
artifacts. Failure to detect probe signals in nonmalignant
cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, inflammatory cells, be-
nign epithelial cells) serves as an indicator of poor-quality
hybridization. At least some of these nonmalignant cells are
expected to have up to two copies per cell of HER2 and
CEP17 discrete signals serving as a quality check for DNA
preservation, reagent perfusion, and sufficient signal-to-
noise ratio. In malignant-appearing cells, discrete signals
are enumerated, or an estimate of signal number is done
when there are numerous overlapping signals (clusters).
Correlation of the scored region(s) on the ISH slide with the
tumor cell population marked on the IHC slide is essential
to ensure that the scored cell population is tumor. In cases
where it is difficult to demarcate the tumor cell population
on the slide, direct pathologist review of the ISH slide and
comparison with the morphology of the tumor on the IHC
and H&E-stained section is often necessary.

 technical failures include improper specimen preparation or
handling, quality checks outside acceptable limits, or artifact
interfering with analysis or microscopy. Several manufacturers
market reagents for HER2 ISH, but as of the date of this publi-
cation, only one manufacturer has FDA approval for GEA
(Dako; eg, HER2 IQFISH pharmDx). The HER2 FISH
pharmDx test used in the ToGA trial is no longer available.
Manufacturer’s instructions are often helpful for guiding ana-
lysis and interpretation of results. In the practice-changing
ToGA trial, Hofmann et al13 recommended modifications to
the duration of pepsin and that temperature stability should be
achieved during pretreatment.
7. Recommendation. Pathologists should select the tissue
block with the areas of lowest grade tumor morphology in bi-
opsy and resection specimens. More than one tissue block may
be selected if different morphologic patterns are present.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength
of recommendation: Recommendation/Moderate)
As mentioned previously, studies show that HER2
overexpression
is
strongly
associated
with
intestinal
phenotype and less frequently with diffuse (signet ring
cell) phenotype of GEA. The rates of HER2 positivity vary
for intestinal (3%-23.5%), diffuse (0%-6%), and mixed
histology
(0%-20%)
cancers.36,85-88
Gastroesophageal
adenocarcinoma has rare morphologic phenotypes that in-
clude adenosquamous, papillary, and neuroendocrine car-
cinomas,74 but data regarding HER2 expression in such
morphologic variants are limited. Most studies8-10,57,86 have
shown anatomic variation with HER2 expression/amplifica-
tion being greater at the gastroesophageal junction than in
the stomach (32.2% vs 21.4%). Correlation of HER2 ex-
pression and/or amplification with histologic grade is diffi-
cult to ascertain, as studies have used different methods,
including two- to four-tiered grading systems. Further, most
studies do not specify the criteria used for grading, and
grading is subjective. The American Joint Committee on
Cancer recommends using a three-tiered system of well
differentiated (G1), moderately differentiated (G2), and
poorly differentiated (G3). Rare undifferentiated carcin-
omas are classified as G3 in this system. HER2 positivity
seems to be more strongly associated with low-grade than
high-grade tumors and varies from 15% to 45% for low
grade and 6% to 28% for high grade in different stud-
ies.36,86,89-91 When choosing a tissue block, selecting one
with the lower grade or intestinal morphology appears more
likely to yield HER2-positive results and is thus recom-
mended. If the cancer comprises substantially different
grades or histologic patterns, it is reasonable to test different
areas, which may require selection of more than one block.
8. Strong Recommendation. Laboratories should report HER2
test results in GEA specimens in accordance with the CAP
“Template for Reporting Results of HER2 (ERBB2) Biomarker
Testing of Specimens From Patients With Adenocarcinoma of
the Stomach or Esophagogastric Junction.”92

of validated protocols for preanalytic and analytic phases of

of test results.95,96
9. Strong Recommendation. Pathologists should identify
areas of invasive adenocarcinoma and also mark areas with
strongest intensity of HER2 expression by IHC in GEA spe-
cimens for subsequent ISH scoring when required.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength
of recommendation: Strong)
This recommendation is intended to provide guidance
on which parts of the slide to prioritize when scoring cells in
ISH assays. Accurate ISH results scoring depends on three
aspects of preanalytic histopathologic features that help lo-
calize regions to score: (1) areas of invasive tumor, (2) areas
of intense HER2 overexpression as visualized on IHC, and
(3) cytomorphology of the malignancy to help select indi-
vidual cells for scoring. Areas of invasive carcinoma are
identified on H&E-stained sections adjacent to the unstained
section used for hybridization. If there are distinct and sep-
arate histologic patterns of malignancy, different areas can
be marked for ISH scoring, although there are few data to
suggest that outcome is improved by separate scoring of
each histologic subtype. More important is that invasive
cancer is marked so that the scorer may scan these areas to
identify regions enriched for amplification to prioritize for
scoring.
Heterogeneity typically refers to intratumor variation in
genotype or gene expression. In gastric cancers, this term is
used when there is focal positivity by IHC or ISH. Ideally, a
HER2 IHC stain of the same block used for ISH should be
reviewed to find areas of maximum HER2 intensity irre-
spective of histologic subtype or grade. False positivity can
be seen in areas of intestinal metaplasia, adjacent to ulcer
sites, or in high-grade dysplasia, and these lesions should be
avoided. Crush artifact and necrotic tissue also should be
avoided. Areas with strongest IHC intensity may signify
gene amplification in heterogeneous tumors.8,42,81-83
Good communication between the histopathologist and
the scorer is critical for resolving difficult interpretations. If
the proportion of malignant cells (as a proportion of all
nucleated cells in the marked area) is low, the pathologist
should communicate this to the ISH laboratory and mention
this in the report, since low tumor cell content reduces con-
fidence in the ISH results. The pathologist should also note
the pattern of malignant cells (glands vs diffuse, sheets of
tumor cells vs interspersed benign inflammatory/stromal
cells) and the shape and relative size of the malignant cell

 nuclei (round vs oval, medium vs large) to assist scorers in
identifying those malignant cells after hybridization and
counterstaining. The goal is to maximize the proportion of
malignant cells scored, while minimizing the proportion of
nonmalignant cells scored. Morphologic evaluation of ISH
stains helps resolve problematic interpretations due to over-
fixation or underfixation, delayed fixation with or without
tissue-drying artifacts, inadequate deparaffinization, or pre-
dicting the value of repeating the test using shorter or longer
protease digestion duration.
Tissue architecture and cytology are often better visual-
ized in brightfield ISH than FISH, so in brightfield ISH, the
morphologic features of malignant cells are typically more
distinguishable from those of benign cells, potentially im-
proving the signal-to-noise ratio. However, compared with
immunostains, brightfield ISH may suffer from less crisp
histopathology because of the protease digestion required to
promote probe dispersion into nuclei and because of the
near-boiling heat required to achieve DNA denaturation.
The FISH signals are often brighter and easier to count than
are brightfield ISH signals.97 Nevertheless, as stated
previously, ISH and FISH results are generally concordant
in
GEA,59,61,65,98,99 and
either
method
is
considered
acceptable.
10. Strong Recommendation. Laboratories must incorpor-
ate GEA HER2 testing methods into their overall laboratory
quality improvement program, establishing appropriate quality
improvement monitors as needed to ensure consistent perform-
ance in all steps of the testing and reporting process. In particu-
lar, laboratories performing GEA HER2 testing should
participate in a formal proficiency testing program, if avail-
able, or an alternative proficiency assurance activity.
(Quality of evidence: Moderate/Intermediate; Strength
of recommendation: Strong)
While a HER2-expressing breast specimen may be ini-
tially used as the positive control,17 validation of actual GEA
specimens is preferred, when such appropriate specimens are
available. Gastric cancer cell lines with HER2 expression may
be used as the positive control100 when a sufficient number of
actual GEA specimens are unavailable, and the procedure
should be specified and documented, since it may differ from
those of breast. Checklists for recording positive and negative
controls for each test should be incorporated into the laboratory
quality improvement program (CAP or other available local
programs). Given the heterogeneity of HER2 reactivity in
GEA,74,75,85,101-104 laboratories may consider tracking their
own statistics of HER2 results in GEA, including interobserver
reproducibility between pathologists and the histologic sub-
types, which may facilitate a better understating of the relevant
issues in HER2 testing in GEA.105-109 Continuing education of
pathologists who report on HER2 GEA specimens is
important, especially in laboratories performing limited num-
bers of GEA specimens in comparison to breast specimens.
11. No Recommendation. There is insufficient evidence to
recommend for or against genomic testing in patients with
GEA at this time.
In addition to IHC and ISH, other techniques have been
used to determine HER2 status. These technologies include
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), single-nucleotide poly-
morphism chip, comparative genomic hybridization array,
gene expression profiling by RNAseq or microarray, targeted/
exome/whole-genome sequencing, or proteomics.84,110 Most
studies comparing these technologies to standard HER2 test
methods have been carried out in breast cancer.111 High con-
cordance has been demonstrated for HER2 status in GEA with
droplet digital PCR compared with IHC and FISH.112 Gene ex-
pression profiling using eight transcripts has been shown to
predict response to trastuzumab- and docetaxel-based chemo-
therapy in GEA with HER2 overexpression.113
Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification is a
multiplex PCR technique that simultaneously quantifies several
gene segments. This technique can be used to interpret whether
the HER2 region of the chromosome is amplified compared
with control regions of chromosome 17.114 However, the con-
trol regions are difficult to select given that segmental amplifi-
cations of chromosome 17, or polysomy 17, may or may not be
present in a given tumor. Furthermore, when tissue is ground
up to carry out nucleic acid extraction, varying proportions of
nucleic acid from malignant and benign cells are represented in
the assay, in comparison to IHC and ISH, where cytologic and
morphologic features may help limit interpretation of malignant
cells. Thus, the criteria for interpreting gene amplification are
difficult to set when using genomic technology. Ideally, the cri-
teria for tissue selection for analysis, and for interpretation of
genomic test results, would be validated with tissues from drug
responders vs nonresponders.
At this time, the main utility for genomic testing is to help
classify cases that are uninterpretable with standard IHC or ISH
technology, such as in the setting of borderline amplification
with or without extra centromere 17 signals by ISH.114
Currently, however, there is insufficient evidence to provide rec-
ommendations for or against the routine use of genomic technol-
ogies for purposes of qualifying for HER2-targeted therapy.
Other General Considerations
Tissue Fixation and Processing
Pathologists should ensure that biopsy or resection spe-
cimens used for HER2 testing are rapidly placed in fixative,

 ideally within 1 hour (cold ischemic time), and are fixed in
10% neutral buffered formalin for 6 to 72 hours. Routine
histology processing and HER2 testing should be per-
formed according to analytically validated protocols, and
laboratories should establish policies to ensure efficient al-
location and utilization of tissue for ancillary testing, par-
ticularly in small specimens. Validation studies must
address preanalytic factors supporting the stated range of
acceptable tissue preparations (eg, 10% neutral buffered
formalin,
alcohol
fixatives,
decalcification,
air-dried
smears, formalin–postfixation). Laboratories should test a
sufficient number of GEA cases to ensure that assays con-
sistently achieve expected results.
Gastroesophageal
adenocarcinoma
specimens
need
prompt fixation for ideal histology, IHC, and ISH testing.
Biopsy specimens should be immediately placed into formalin
in the endoscopy suite. Pathologists should communicate with
gastroenterology colleagues to ensure prompt fixation and
documentation. Surgical specimens require prompt specimen
transport and opening of the specimen (by pathologist or appro-
priately trained personnel) to ensure prompt exposure of the
tumor to adequate volumes of 10% neutral buffered formalin.
Surgical specimens may need to first be inked, the tumor
incised, and the specimen pinned on a cork or wax board to fa-
cilitate fixation. Pathologists should work with surgeons, nurses,
and/or operating room personnel to facilitate recording of surgi-
cal specimen ischemic time and appropriate handling.115
Considerations regarding tissue ischemic and fixation
time follow from principles of proteolytic degradation and
fixation chemistry,115,116 with data drawn mostly from the
breast cancer literature.16,17,115,117
There is a need for direct data regarding the impact of
ischemic time (time from specimen removal from the pa-
tient to fixation) and fixation time (time tumor is exposed to
adequate volumes of formalin) on HER2 testing in GEA.
One model using gastric cancer cell lines of known HER2
expression xenografted into mice demonstrated decreased
IHC staining with delayed fixation of 6 and 24 hours with
the Hercept test and decreased HER2 to CEP17 FISH ratios
compared with immediate fixation.100 This delayed fixation
resulted in negative IHC and FISH interpretation for several
samples with expected 2þ IHC staining and HER2 to
CEP17 ratio of 2.3 (SHC cell line). Unfortunately, ischemic
intervals between 0 and 6 hours were not tested.100 This
same study demonstrated no effect of prolonged fixation of
5 and 7 days compared with 24-hour fixation but noted di-
minished IHC staining with 10-day fixation or use of fixa-
tives other than 10% neutral buffered formalin.100
Full validation of the HER2 testing protocol should be
performed for FFPE specimens, as described previously in
Recommendation 4. Discussion of limited available data for
alternatively fixed or decalcified specimens is provided below.
Regarding cytologic specimens, we are aware of a sin-
gle small study (mentioned previously) of HER2 testing in
gastric cancer effusion specimens (formalin-fixed plasma
thrombin clots), which demonstrated concordance with tis-
sue specimens in all of 18 cases but acknowledged more
granularity of HER2 staining and difficulty in interpreting
membrane staining in discohesive tumor preparations.39 A
sampling of studies comparing cytologic cell block prepar-
ations with FFPE breast carcinoma specimens evaluated for
HER2 by immunohistochemistry demonstrates 87% to
100% positive agreement and 66% to 100% negative agree-
ment (excluding 2þ equivocal scores)39,118-124; however,
one small study exploring ethanol, cytolyte, and formalin-
fixed cytologic breast cancer specimens is calculated to
have only 14% to 40% positive agreement and 100% nega-
tive agreement with matched FFPE breast tissue samples
(again excluding 2þ scores).125 Several studies39,120,122 re-
ported false-positive interpretations, some attributed to
cytoplasmic background staining.
There are wide differences in the handling and process-
ing of cytologic preparations between studies and between
laboratories (eg, proprietary fixative, alcohol-based fixative,
alternative fixative followed by formalin fixation, direct for-
malin fixation),39,118-122,125,126 and effects vary by antigen/
antibody.127 This further emphasizes the need for appropri-
ate evaluation of HER2 staining of cytologic specimens in
individual laboratories before testing and reporting patient
samples. Nonformalin fixatives also have complexities for
HER2 ISH testing,122,128,129 yet several studies123,124,130
have shown good results with HER2 FISH on cytologic
breast cancer specimens.
Diminished IHC staining occurs after decalcification
with a variety of antigen-antibody combinations,127,131 yet
studies of HER2 antibodies are lacking. Prolonged hydro-
chloric acid–based decalcification after formalin fixation
was shown to have deleterious effects on the HER2 ISH
assay in a breast tumor and xenograft study.129 Again, de-
calcification protocols vary widely among laboratories,
reinforcing the need for local assay evaluation. While it re-
mains impractical to fully validate every specimen vari-
ation
(cytology,
decalcification),
laboratories
should
confirm test performance of HER2 assays on these types of
specimens before reporting patient results (with testing
paradigm to be determined by the laboratory director,
based on local practices).
Turnaround Time
Laboratories must provide clinically appropriate turn-
around times and optimal utilization of tissue specimens by
using appropriate techniques (IHC and ISH) for HER2 in
GEA. To inform therapeutic decision making, HER2 results

 should be reported promptly. The panel recommends a
benchmark of 90% of reports available within 10 working
days from the date of procedure or specimen acquisition.
Laboratories that require send out of tests for HER2 testing
in GEA should process and send specimens to reference lab-
oratories in a timely manner. The panel suggests that a
benchmark of 90% of specimens be sent to the reference la-
boratory within 3 working days of tissue processing.
Conclusions
Gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma continues to be a
major health care burden throughout the world. Advanced
GEA that is not amenable to effective local therapy remains in-
curable, and patients have limited therapeutic options. Other
than HER2, there is no biomarker available for selection of
therapy for patients with advanced GEA. Trastuzumab is the
only approved HER2-directed therapy that has resulted in
modest but statistically significant prolongation of overall sur-
vival of patients with HER2-positive GEA.
Given the potential impact of HER2 status on therapeutic
decision making in GEA, clear guidance is needed for medical
oncologists and pathologists in testing for, and interpretation
of, HER2 status. A guideline specific for GEA was needed be-
cause, although a comparable guideline exists for assessment
of HER2 in breast cancer, the pattern of HER2 protein overex-
pression and/or gene amplification in GEA is distinctly differ-
ent. Because of considerable heterogeneity of HER2 protein
and gene expression in GEAs, scoring methodology for GEA
is different than for breast cancer. To develop this evidence-
based guideline for HER2 testing, the CAP, ASCP, and ASCO
convened a multidisciplinary panel with broad expertise in the
clinical and pathologic aspects of GEA. The panel developed a
set of 11 recommendations that are pertinent to various aspects
of establishing HER2 status. The guideline provides evidence-
based recommendations for specimen identification, process-
ing, testing methodology for IHC and ISH, interpretation of re-
sults, and the potential for clinical implementation.
The guideline recommends that HER2 status should be
established in all patients with advanced GEA who are eli-
gible for systemic (and especially HER2-directed) therapy.
Tumor specimens from primary or metastatic GEA may be
used for assessment. Testing should begin with IHC. If the
result is negative (0 or 1þ) or positive (3þ), no further test-
ing is required. If the result is equivocal (2þ) by IHC, subse-
quent testing by ISH should be performed to determine
amplification status. Patients whose tumor is considered
HER2 positive (IHC 3þ or IHC 2þ and ISH positive/ampli-
fied) should be informed of the results, and HER2-directed
therapy should be offered along with combination chemo-
therapy. Although the guideline recommends that HER2
status should be assessed in all patients with advanced
GEA, it is acknowledged that some patients are not candi-
dates for systemic therapy owing to poor general condition
and poor performance status. In such patients, HER2 testing
is not required. There are other circumstances where the
HER2 status in a given patient is unclear owing to technical
aspects (inadequate tumor or inability to adequately inter-
pret the processed specimen) on a prior attempt. In these cir-
cumstances, collection of an additional tumor specimen is
recommended but only when there are no major safety con-
cerns associated with such a procedure.
Finally, as the fields of genomics, proteomics, and bio-
technology continue to evolve, novel and more accurate meth-
ods of assessing HER2 status may become available.
Similarly, as more clinical trials are conducted on HER2-
directed therapy in GEA, changes in treatment algorithms may
necessitate updates to these recommendations in the future.
This guideline was developed through collaboration be-
tween the College of American Pathologists, American
Society for Clinical Pathology, and the American Society of
Clinical Oncology and has been jointly published by invita-
tion and consent in the Archives of Pathology & Laboratory
Medicine, American Journal of Clinical Pathology, and
Journal of Clinical Oncology. It has been edited in accord-
ance with standards established at the Archives of Pathology
