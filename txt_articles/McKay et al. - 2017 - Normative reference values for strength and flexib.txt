Normative reference values for strength
and flexibility of 1,000 children and adults
ABSTRACT
Objective: To establish reference values for isometric strength of 12 muscle groups and flexibility
of 13 joint movements in 1,000 children and adults and investigate the influence of demographic
and anthropometric factors.
Methods: A standardized reliable protocol of hand-held and fixed dynamometry for isometric
strength of ankle, knee, hip, elbow, and shoulder musculature as well as goniometry for flexibility
of the ankle, knee, hip, elbow, shoulder, and cervical spine was performed in an observational
study investigating 1,000 healthy male and female participants aged 3–101 years. Correlation
and multiple regression analyses were performed to identify factors independently associated
with strength and flexibility of children, adolescents, adults, and older adults.
Results: Normative reference values of 25 strength and flexibility measures were generated.
Strong linear correlations between age and strength were identified in the first 2 decades of life.
Muscle strength significantly decreased with age in older adults. Regression modeling identified
increasing height as the most significant predictor of strength in children, higher body mass in
adolescents, and male sex in adults and older adults. Joint flexibility gradually decreased with
age, with little sex difference. Waist circumference was a significant predictor of variability in joint
flexibility in adolescents, adults, and older adults.
Conclusions: Reference values and associated age- and sex-stratified z scores generated from
this study can be used to determine the presence and extent of impairments associated with
neuromuscular and other neurologic disorders, monitor disease progression over time in nat-
ural history studies, and evaluate the effect of new treatments in clinical trials. Neurology®
2017;88:36–43
Meaningful, reliable, and sensitive outcome measures are required to monitor treatment and
progression of neuromuscular and other neurologic disorders. While there have been substantial
advances in the understanding of the pathogenesis and natural history of many neuromuscular
disorders, the identification and development of new outcome measures that best reflect the effi-
cacy of specific treatments have not advanced at the same rate.1 Establishing valid and responsive
outcome measures is a priority for the field.2 To assist in the development of new outcome
measures, normative reference values generated from large populations across the lifespan using
standardized methods are required. Normative reference values can be utilized to generate z
scores, which can be used in multicenter studies to improve outcome measure precision and
responsiveness.
Muscle weakness and joint contractures predispose to numerous pathologies requiring inter-
vention. Reference data play an important role in identifying and quantifying these impairments
and evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. Currently, few comprehensive datasets detail
the normal variation of active range of motion in healthy individuals and are limited by the
number of joints assessed,3 the age range of participants,4,5 or insufficient sex representation.6,7

 Similar limitations exist in strength reference
datasets, relevant only to children8–11 or adult
populations,12–16 or strength measured using
equipment not readily available in clinic.17–19
The purpose of this study was to generate
a reference dataset of normative values across
the lifespan for an extensive set of isometric
muscle strength and joint flexibility items,
stratified for age and sex, and to investigate
the influence of demographic and anthropo-
metric factors.
METHODS Study design and participants. Data were col-
lected as part of the 1,000 Norms Project, an observational
study investigating physical function and self-reported health
in 1,000 people across the lifespan (see full protocol20). One
thousand people aged between 3 and 101 years from the Greater
Sydney metropolitan area in Australia participated in the
project. Participants were recruited from January 2014 to
September 2015 using highly structured convenience and
snowball sampling techniques, including advertising via social
media, e-newsletters, and community flyers. Presentations were
held at social and volunteer groups, aged care organizations,
playgroups, and schools. Eligible participants were aged $3
years, considered themselves healthy for their age, and could
participate
in
age-appropriate
activities
of
daily
living.
People with significant health conditions affecting physical
performance
or
an
inability
to
follow
age-appropriate
instructions were excluded. Potential participants with the
following conditions were also excluded: diagnosed diabetes
mellitus; malignant cancers; demyelinating, inflammatory, or
degenerative neurologic conditions; pregnancy; class 3 obesity;
severe
cardiac
or
pulmonary
disease;
joint
replacement;
infectious or inflammatory arthropathies; or severe mobility
impairment necessitating dependence on mobility aids for all
ambulation. Equal numbers of male and female participants
were recruited and were stratified into 9 age categories. One
hundred people per decade were recruited in the age groups
of 20–29, 30–39, 40–49, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, and 801
years. In order to represent the rapid periods of growth and
maturation and to distinguish between young children and
adolescents, 20 children per year from 3 to 9 years of age and
16 per year from 10 to 19 years of age were recruited.
Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. Ethical approval was granted by the institutional
Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC 2013/640) and
written informed consent was obtained from all participants or
parents/guardians of children.
Procedure. Participants attended the University of Sydney Perfor-
mance Laboratory once for a 2-hour assessment. Participants had
their height, body mass, waist circumference, and lower limb
alignment measured. Foot structure was assessed using the Foot
Posture Index, a 6-item summed scale from 212 (supinated) to
112 (pronated).21 Age, sex, current work status, and self-reported
ethnicity were collected from all participants or parents/guardians.
Work status was classified as working (full-time, part-time, or
unpaid) or not currently working (unemployed, student, or
retired). Ethnicity was classified into 5 categories: British/
European, American, Asian, African, and Aboriginal/Torres Strait
Islander.
Two experienced clinical evaluators (physiotherapists) as-
sessed isometric strength and joint flexibility using standard-
ized methodology, including instructions, positioning, and
scoring.20 The dominant limb was assessed and determined
as the hand used to write with and the foot used to kick a ball.
The strength of 12 muscle groups—hand grip, ankle dorsiflex-
ors and plantarflexors, knee flexors and extensors, hip abduc-
tors, internal and external rotators, elbow flexors and extensors,
and shoulder internal and external rotators—were assessed by
maximal voluntary isometric contraction using a portable
hand-held dynamometer (Citec dynamometer CT 3001; CIT
Technics, Groningen, Netherlands). The dynamometer was
calibrated 0–500 N with certified weights monthly throughout
data collection. The strength of knee musculature in partici-
pants $12 years of age was assessed by fixed dynamometry
(CSMi; HUMAC NORM, Stoughton, MA). For unit of mea-
sure consistency, knee flexor and extensor strength in children
aged 3–11 years were converted to Newton-meters (Nm) using
anthropometric tables.22 Rather than using the fixation device
outlined in the protocol, ankle plantarflexion strength was
assessed using hand-held dynamometry in long sitting, heel
over plinth edge.
Joint flexibility was assessed using a universal goniometer,
digital inclinometer, or bubble inclinometer (Baseline; Fabri-
cation Enterprises Inc., White Plains, NY) depending on the
joint assessed. Thirteen active joint range movements were as-
sessed: ankle dorsiflexion and plantarflexion, knee flexion and
extension, hip flexion, internal and external rotation, elbow
flexion and extension, shoulder internal and external rotation,
and cervical flexion and extension. Interrater reliability of the
clinical evaluators demonstrated satisfactory repeatability of
all strength and flexibility measures (intraclass correlation
coefficient2,1 0.80–0.99) in a pilot study of 10 participants
aged 6–67 years.
Data analysis. Data were collected and managed using
REDCap electronic data capture and manually checked for
transcription errors. Reference values were generated for each
age group and sex in SPSS v22 Statistics for Windows
(IBM SPSS; Armonk, NY). Normality of the data was as-
sessed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For analysis, age
categories were children (3–9 years), adolescents (10–19
years), adults (20–59 years), and older adults (601 years).
To determine if strength and flexibility differed between male
and female participants, independent t tests were conducted.
A series of multiple regression models was constructed to
determine the extent to which muscle strength and joint
flexibility were influenced by participant demographic (age
and sex) and anthropometric factors (height, body mass,
waist
circumference,
foot
posture,
and
lower
limb
alignment).
First,
Pearson
product-moment
correlation
coefficients (r) were generated to explore the bivariate
relationships between strength and anthropometric and
demographic factors. The same correlations were explored
for each joint flexibility measure. Second, factors identified
to have an association (r $ 0.3, p , 0.05) with strength or
joint flexibility were entered simultaneously into a stepwise
multiple regression model, which was reduced to a set of factors
that best predicted and could be regarded as independent
determinants of each strength and joint flexibility measure.
To avoid multicollinearity, only one variable from highly
correlated (r $ 0.7) variables was included. Standardized b
weights were calculated to provide an indication of the
relative importance of the contribution of the various factors
entered into the model to explain the variance in joint flexibility

 or muscle strength. Variables were retained in the multiple
regression model if p , 0.05.
RESULTS To recruit 1,000 participants, 2,972
e-mails and 240 phone calls were logged. Ninety-one
potential participants were excluded in accordance
with the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among
adults aged over 18 years, 56% were currently
working and 44% were not (31% retired and 13%
students
or
unemployed).
Participants
were
of
diverse geographic ancestry, although the majority of
participants were British/European ethnicity (74.4%),
followed
by
Asian
(16.6%),
North
or
South
American (5.1%), African (2.4%), and Aboriginal or
Torres Strait Islander (1.5%). The sample mean (SD)
age was 40.9 years (26.1), body mass 62.9 kg (21.1),
height 1.61 m (0.02), waist circumference 78.6 cm
(15.4), Foot Posture Index 3.5 (2.4), and lower limb
alignment 1.88 (2.7). Ninety-three percent were right-
footed and 91% were right-handed.
All missing data were accounted for. Four children
declined to perform ankle dorsiflexion strength and
12 children were unable to perform cervical flexion
and extension joint movements in accordance with
the protocol. Ankle plantarflexors for 7 male adults
and ankle dorsiflexors for 1 male adult were not as-
sessed with hand-held dynamometry during periods
of offsite calibration and servicing; 6 adults and 8 old-
er adults were not assessed using fixed dynamometry
due to safety concerns.

muscle groups per age category (children, adolescents,
adults, and older adults) and sex are presented in

org. From adolescence, male participants were signif-
icantly stronger in all muscle groups across all ages.
There were no significant (p , 0.05) differences
between the strength measures of boys or girls aged
3–9 years, except for shoulder internal rotators (p 5
0.031), where boys were stronger. Correlations
between strength and participant demographics and
anthropometrics for children, adolescents, adults, and
older adults are presented in table e-2. In children and
adolescents, strength and age were highly correlated
(p , 0.05), confirming that children become signif-
icantly stronger as they age from childhood and
through adolescence. From 20 years of age, the rela-
tionship between strength and age changed. In adults
aged 20–59 years, reduced strength with age was evi-
denced by significant, although weak, correlations
with hand grip, ankle dorsiflexors, knee flexors and
extensors, and shoulder external rotators. In older
adults, decreased strength with increasing age was
evidenced in all muscle groups. All muscle groups
across all age categories demonstrated that greater
height, body mass, and waist circumference were sig-
nificantly associated with greater strength. The
changes in strength measures with advancing age
are shown in figure 1. Table e-3 shows the results
of the multiple analyses. In children, height, followed

 by waist circumference, was the most significant pre-
dictor of strength. In adolescents, a combination of
body mass, sex, and age were shown to be the stron-
gest independent predictors of strength. Sex (male)
was the most significant predictor of strength in
adults, followed by height and body mass with lower
predictive values. In older adults, sex (male) was the
most significant predictor, with body mass, height,
and age demonstrating lower predictive values.
Normative reference values for active range of
motion per age category (children, adolescents,
adults, and older adults) and sex are presented in
table 2 and per decade in table e-4. There was no
significant difference (p , 0.05) in joint flexibility
between boys and girls aged 3–9 years, except for
hip internal rotation (p 5 0.017), where girls had
greater flexibility. Active range of motion was greatest
in children compared to older adults. Figure 2 illus-
trates the inverse relationship between joint flexibility
in all joints with age. Pearson correlations (table e-2)
demonstrate that a decrease in flexibility with aging
occurred in 8 of 13 joints of both adolescents and

 adults and in 12 joints of older adults (p , 0.05).
Greater body mass and waist circumference were
associated with a decrease in joint flexibility from
10 years of age. The correlation between height and
joint flexibility was strongest in adolescents, where
taller individuals demonstrated less joint range of
motion. From adolescence to older adulthood, a more
pronated foot posture was associated with a greater
range of ankle dorsiflexion. Lower limb alignment did
not demonstrate any significant correlations, beyond
very weak associations, with measures of flexibility in
any age category. In children, 2 multiple regression
models (see table e-4) reached significance (knee
extension and neck extension) and revealed height
as the most significant predictor. Age, waist circum-
ference, and height were the strongest independent
predictors of flexibility in adolescents. For all adults
older than 20 years, age, sex, and waist circumference
were the strongest predictors of joint flexibility.
DISCUSSION Thisstudyhas establishedacomprehen-
sive reference dataset of isometric muscle strength and
joint flexibility in 1,000 healthy people aged 3–101
years. The associations between strength and flexibility
measures with demographic and anthropometric
variables within different age categories identified
some important relationships. As expected, there is
a highly significant increase in strength of all muscle
groups as children rapidly develop through to early
adulthood. From adulthood, this relationship changes
and a decrease in muscle strength with aging starts
to occur; by older adulthood, all muscle groups dem-
onstrate loss of strength with aging. From 10 years of
age, a time of life coinciding with rapid growth and
maturation, males are significantly stronger in all
measures. In contrast, joint flexibility demonstrates
a steady decline with age and no meaningful differ-
ence between males and females.
Our results are consistent with previous studies
investigating isometric muscle strength in children8,9
and adults.12–14 However, direct comparison is lim-
ited by differences in age range, sample size, and
muscle groups evaluated. Some studies report body
mass as the strongest correlate with muscle strength in
children,8–11 while others demonstrate as we did that
height showed the strongest relationship and was the
most significant predictor of strength.23,24 In adults,
a decline in strength was most strongly associated
with aging in 5 muscle groups (hand grip, ankle dor-
siflexors, shoulder external rotators, knee flexors, and
extensors), while in older adulthood all muscle groups
demonstrated a significant decline in strength associ-
ated with aging. These results suggest a muscle-
specific response to aging during adulthood and that
generalized weakness does not occur until older adult-
hood. This highlights the importance of using age-
and sex-matched reference data for specific muscle
groups to avoid overrepresentation or underrepresen-
tation of the force capabilities of a particular muscle
group. Similar relationships between aging and mus-
cle weakness have been reported in a limited number
of adult studies.12–14

 The association between waist circumference and
strength and flexibility has not been reported previ-
ously. Waist circumference was identified as a signifi-
cant predictor of flexibility in adolescents, adults, and
older adults and of strength in children. Epidemio-
logic studies have identified an association between
waist circumference and tendon pathology,25 with
preliminary evidence supporting either a mechanical
effect (due to increased load) or systemic effect (due
to circulating lipids).26 The influence of adiposity on
localized musculo-tendinous tissues in neuromuscu-
lar disorders will be an important factor to evaluate
with the increasing rates of obesity in society.
Few studies report normative reference values for
flexibility in children. Our normative reference values
for adults are consistent with the literature.3,4,7 We
identified only one sex difference in the flexibility of
children (namely hip internal rotation), and only
small differences (28–68) between men and women
from adolescence through to older adulthood. As
such, sex does not seem to have a clinically important
effect on the joint flexibility of healthy adolescents
and adults. There is no consensus in the literature
regarding sex differences and flexibility; some studies
report, as we have, that there is no clinically relevant
difference,4 while others report sex differences.5 We
identified a linear decrease in joint flexibility associ-
ated with advancing age, consistent with the adult
literature.3 It is likely that in healthy individuals, joint
flexibility declines gradually and steadily with age and
a substantial or sudden decline should be considered
indicative of an underlying pathology.
Studies characterizing the functional decline and rate
of progression of neuromuscular disorders such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,27 Duchenne muscular dys-
trophy,28 and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease29 depend
on hand-held dynamometry to capture and track rele-
vant changes in muscle strength. Access to reliable and
expansive normative reference values and associated age-
and sex-matched z scores are necessary to accurately and
precisely quantify response to new interventions and to
establish minimum clinically important differences.
This study is not without limitation. Participants
were recruited through convenience sampling meth-
ods and with the exclusion criteria of conditions
affecting physical performance may have resulted in
a population that were particularly healthy and phys-
ically capable for their age. While the mixed ethnicity
of our sample is reflective of the Australian popula-
tion, the ethno-geographic variation in strength and
flexibility measures could not be established. The
cross-sectional study design was effective in achieving
our study aim of generating a reference dataset of
strength and flexibility across the lifespan; however,
the direction of some of the cause and effect relation-
ships can only be identified in longitudinal studies
that track the changes in these measures over time.
Ankle plantarflexion strength in healthy adolescents
and adults can only ever be estimated with hand-
held dynamometry due to the very high force capabil-
ity (often exceeding 1,000 N).30 The reported
reference values for ankle plantarflexors are likely to
underestimate the force capabilities of this muscle
group, and values should be used as a lower threshold
for weakness in patients with neuromuscular and
other neurologic disorders. Finally, the strength and
flexibility reference values are specific to the Citec
hand-held dynamometer and Baseline goniometer
and inclinometer and may not be interchangeable
with data obtained from other devices.
The normative reference data generated from this
study can be used to determine the presence and
extent of impairments associated with neuromuscular
disorders and to monitor disease progression over
time. The reference values and associated age- and
sex-matched z scores can be used to develop outcome
measures with enhanced precision and responsiveness
to be used in clinical trials for neuromuscular and
other neurologic disorders.
